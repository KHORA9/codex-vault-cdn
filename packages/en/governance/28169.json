DE\r\n     CHATEAUBRIAND, M. SUARD, MADAME DE STAEL, M. DE FONTANES,\r\n     M. ROYER-COLLARD.--PROPOSAL TO APPOINT ME AUDITOR IN THE IMPERIAL\r\n     STATE COUNCIL.--WHY THE APPOINTMENT DID NOT TAKE PLACE.--I ENTER\r\n     THE UNIVERSITY, AND BEGIN MY COURSE OF LECTURES ON MODERN\r\n     HISTORY.--LIBERAL AND ROYALIST PARTIES.--CHARACTERS OF THE\r\n     DIFFERENT OPPOSITIONS TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE EMPIRE.--ATTEMPTED\r\n     RESISTANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY.--MM.

I am not prompted to this by the weariness of inaction, or\r\nby any desire to re-open a limited field for old contentions, in place\r\nof the grand arena at present closed. I have struggled much and ardently\r\nduring my life; age and retirement, as far as my own feelings are\r\nconcerned, have expanded their peaceful influence over the past. From a\r\nsky profoundly serene, I look back towards an horizon pregnant with many\r\nstorms. I have deeply probed my own heart, and I cannot find there any\r\nfeeling which envenoms my recollections. The absence of gall permits\r\nextreme candour. Personality alters or deteriorates truth. Being\r\ndesirous to speak of my own life, and of the times in which I have\r\nlived, I prefer doing so on the brink, rather than from the depths of\r\nthe tomb. This appears to me more dignified as regards myself, while,\r\nwith reference to others, it will lead me to be more scrupulous in my\r\nwords and opinions. If objections arise, which I can scarcely hope to\r\nescape, at least it shall not be said that I was unwilling to hear them,\r\nand that I have removed myself from the responsibility of what I have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nOther reasons, also, have induced this decision. Memoirs, in general,\r\nare either published too soon or too late. If too soon, they are\r\nindiscreet or unimportant; we either reveal what would be better held\r\nback for the present, or suppress details which it would be both\r\nprofitable and curious to relate at once. If too late, they lose much of\r\ntheir opportunity and interest; contemporaries have passed away, and can\r\nno longer profit by the truths which are imparted, or participate in\r\ntheir recital with personal enjoyment. Such memoirs retain only a moral\r\nand literary value, and excite no feeling beyond idle curiosity.\r\nAlthough I well know how much experience evaporates in passing from one\r\ngeneration to another, I cannot believe that it becomes altogether\r\nextinct, or that a correct knowledge of the mistakes of our fathers, and\r\nof the causes of their failures, can be totally profitless to their\r\ndescendants. I wish to transmit to those who may succeed me, and who\r\nalso will have their trials to undergo, a little of the light I have\r\nderived from mine. I have, alternately, defended liberty against\r\nabsolute power, and order against the spirit of revolution,--two leading\r\ncauses which, in fact, constitute but one, for their disconnection leads\r\nto the ruin of both. Until liberty boldly separates itself from the\r\nspirit of revolution, and order from absolute power, so long will France\r\ncontinue to be tossed about from crisis to crisis, and from error to\r\nerror. In this is truly comprised the cause of the nation. I am grieved,\r\nbut not dismayed, at its reverses. I neither renounce its service, nor\r\ndespair of its triumph. Under the severest disappointments, it has ever\r\nbeen my natural tendency, and for which I thank God as for a blessing,\r\nto preserve great desires, however uncertain or distant might be the\r\nhopes of their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIn ancient and in modern times, the greatest of great historians,\r\nThucydides, Xenophon, Sallust, Caesar, Tacitus, Macchiavelli, and\r\nClarendon, have written, and some have themselves published, the annals\r\nof the passing age and of the events in which they participated. I do\r\nnot venture on such an ambitious work; the day of history has not yet\r\narrived for us, of complete, free, and unreserved history, either as\r\nrelates to facts or men. But my own personal and inward history; what I\r\nhave thought, felt, and wished in my connection with the public affairs\r\nof my country; the thoughts, feelings, and wishes of my political\r\nfriends and associates, our minds reflected in our actions,--on these\r\npoints I can speak freely, and on these I am most desirous to record my\r\nsentiments, that I may be, if not always approved, at least correctly\r\nknown and understood. On this foundation, others will hereafter assign\r\nto us our proper places in the history of the age.\r\n\r\nI only commenced public life in the year 1814. I had neither served\r\nunder the Revolution nor the Empire: a stranger to the first from youth,\r\nand to the second from disposition. Since I have had some share in the\r\ngovernment of men, I have learned to do justice to the Emperor Napoleon.\r\nHe was endowed with a genius incomparably active and powerful, much to\r\nbe admired for his antipathy to disorder, for his profound instincts in\r\nruling, and for his energetic rapidity in reconstructing the social\r\nframework. But this genius had no check, acknowledged no limit to its\r\ndesires or will, either emanating from Heaven or man, and thus remained\r\nrevolutionary while combating revolution: thoroughly acquainted with the\r\ngeneral conditions of society, but imperfectly, or rather, coarsely\r\nunderstanding the moral necessities of human nature; sometimes\r\nsatisfying them with the soundest judgment, and at others depreciating\r\nand insulting them with impious pride. Who could have believed that the\r\nsame man who had established the Concordat, and re-opened the churches\r\nin France, would have carried off the Pope from Rome, and kept him a\r\nprisoner at Fontainebleau?\r\n\r\nIt is going too far to apply the same ill-treatment to philosophers and\r\nChristians, to reason and faith. Amongst the great men of his class,\r\nNapoleon was by far the most necessary for the times. None but himself\r\ncould have so quickly and effectually substituted order in place of\r\nanarchy; but no one was so chimerical as to the future, for after having\r\nbeen master of France and Europe, he suffered Europe to drive him even\r\nfrom France. His name is greater and more enduring than his actions, the\r\nmost brilliant of which, his conquests, disappeared suddenly and for\r\never, with himself. In rendering homage to his exalted qualities, I feel\r\nno regret at not having appreciated them until after his death. For me,\r\nunder the Empire, there was too much of the arrogance of power, too much\r\ncontempt of right, too much revolution, and too little liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is not that at that period I was much engaged in politics, or\r\nover-impatient for the freedom that should open to me the road I\r\ndesired. I associated myself with the Opposition, but it was an\r\nOpposition bearing little resemblance to that which we have seen and\r\ncreated during the last thirty years. It was formed from the relics of\r\nthe philosophic world and liberal aristocracy of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe last representatives of the saloons in which all subjects whatever\r\nhad been freely proposed and discussed, through the impulse of\r\ninclination, and the gratification of mental indulgence, rather than\r\nfrom any distinct object of interest or ambition. The errors and\r\ndisasters of the Revolution had not led the survivors of that active\r\ngeneration to renounce their convictions or desires; they remained\r\nsincerely liberal, but without practical or urgent pretension, and with\r\nthe reserve of men who had suffered much and succeeded little in their\r\nattempts at legislative reform. They still held to freedom of thought\r\nand speech, but had no aspirations after power. They detested and warmly\r\ncriticized despotism, but without any open attempt to repress or\r\noverthrow existing authority. It was the opposition of enlightened and\r\nindependent lookers-on, who had neither the opportunity nor inclination\r\nto interfere as actors.\r\n\r\nAfter a long life of fierce contention, I recur with pleasure to the\r\nremembrance of this enchanting society. M. de Talleyrand once said to\r\nme, \"Those who were not living in and about the year 1789, know little\r\nof the enjoyments of life.\" In fact, nothing could exceed the pleasure\r\nof a great intellectual and social movement, which, at that epoch, far\r\nfrom suspending or disturbing the arrangements of the world, animated\r\nand ennobled them by mingling serious thoughts with frivolous\r\nrecreations, and as yet called for no suffering, or no sacrifice, while\r\nit opened to the eyes of men a dazzling and delightful perspective. The\r\neighteenth century was, beyond all question, the most tempting and\r\nseductive of ages, for it promised to satisfy at once the strength and\r\nweakness of human nature; elevating and enervating the mind at the same\r\ntime; flattering alternately the noblest sentiments and the most\r\ngrovelling propensities; intoxicating with exalted hopes, and nursing\r\nwith effeminate concessions. Thus it has produced, in pellmell\r\nconfusion, utopians and egotists, sceptics and fanatics, enthusiasts and\r\nincredulous scoffers, different offspring of the same period, but all\r\nenraptured with the age and with themselves, indulging together in one\r\ncommon drunkenness on the eve of the approaching chaos.\r\n\r\nWhen I first mixed with the world in 1807, the storm had for a long time\r\nburst; the infatuation of 1789 had completely disappeared. Society,\r\nentirely occupied with its own re-establishment, no longer dreamed of\r\nelevating itself in the midst of mere amusement; exhibitions of force\r\nhad superseded impulses towards liberty. Coldness, absence of\r\nfellow-feeling, isolation of sentiment and interests,--in these are\r\ncomprised the ordinary course and weary vexations of the world. France,\r\nworn out with errors and strange excesses, eager once more for order and\r\ncommon sense, fell back into the old track. In the midst of this general\r\nreaction, the faithful inheritors of the literary saloons of the\r\neighteenth century held themselves aloof from its influence; they alone\r\npreserved two of the noblest and most amiable propensities of their\r\nage--a disinterested taste for pleasures of the mind, and that readiness\r\nof sympathy, that warmth and ardour of curiosity, that necessity for\r\nmoral improvement and free discussion, which embellish the social\r\nrelations with so much variety and sweetness.\r\n\r\nIn my own case, I drew from these sources a profitable experience. Led\r\ninto the circle I have named, by an incident in my private life, I\r\nentered amongst them very young, perfectly unknown, with no other title\r\nthan a little presumed ability, some education, and an ardent taste for\r\nrefined pleasures, letters, and good company. I carried with me no ideas\r\nharmonizing with those I found there. I had been brought up at Geneva,\r\nwith extremely liberal notions, but in austere habits and religious\r\nconvictions entirely opposed to the philosophy of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, rather than in coincidence with or in admiration of its works\r\nand tendencies. During my residence in Paris, German metaphysics and\r\nliterature had been my favourite study; I read Kant and Klopstock,\r\nHerder and Schiller, much more frequently than Condillac and Voltaire.\r\nM. Suard, the Abbe Morellet, the Marquis de Boufflers, the frequenters\r\nof the drawing-rooms of Madame d'Houdetot and of Madame de Rumford, who\r\nreceived me with extreme complaisance, smiled, and sometimes grew tired\r\nof my Christian traditions and Germanic enthusiasm; but, after all, this\r\ndifference of opinion established for me, in their circle, a plea of\r\ninterest and favour instead of producing any feeling of illwill or even\r\nof indifference. They knew that I was as sincerely attached to liberty\r\nand the privileges of human intelligence as they were themselves, and\r\nthey discovered something novel and independent in my turn of thought,\r\nwhich inspired both esteem and attraction. At this period, they\r\nconstantly supported me with their friendship and interest, without ever\r\nattempting to press or control me on the points on which we disagreed.\r\nFrom them especially, I have learned to exercise in practical life, that\r\nexpanded equity, joined to respect for the freedom of others, which\r\nconstitute the character and duty of a truly liberal mind.\r\n\r\nThis generous disposition manifested itself on every opportunity. In\r\n1809, M. de Chateaubriand published 'The Martyrs.' The success of this\r\nwork was at first slow, and strongly disputed. Amongst the disciples of\r\nthe eighteenth century and of Voltaire, a great majority treated\r\nM. de Chateaubriand as an enemy, while the more moderate section looked\r\non him with little favour. They rejected his ideas even when they felt\r\nthat they were not called upon to contest them. His style of writing\r\noffended their taste, which was divested of all imagination, and more\r\nrefined than grand. My own disposition was entirely opposed to theirs. I\r\npassionately admired M. de Chateaubriand in his ideas and language: that\r\nbeautiful compound of religious sentiment and romantic imagination, of\r\npoetry and moral polemics, had so powerfully moved and subdued me, that,\r\nsoon after my arrival at Paris in 1806, one of my first literary\r\nfantasies was to address an epistle, in very indifferent verse, to\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, who immediately thanked me in prose, artistically\r\npolished and unassuming. His letter flattered my youth, and 'The\r\nMartyrs' redoubled my zeal. Seeing them so violently attacked, I\r\nresolved to defend them in the 'Publicist,' in which I occasionally\r\nwrote. M. Suard, who conducted that journal, although far from\r\ncoinciding with the opinions I had adopted, lent himself most obligingly\r\nto my desire. I have met with very few men of a natural temperament so\r\ngentle and liberal, and with a mind at the same time scrupulously\r\nrefined and fastidious. He was much more disposed to criticize than to\r\nadmire the talent of M. de Chateaubriand; but he admitted the great\r\nextent of his ability, and on that ground dealt with him gently,\r\nalthough with delicate irony. Besides which, the talent was full of\r\nindependence, and exerted in opposition to the formidable tendencies of\r\nImperial power. These qualities won largely upon the esteem of M. Suard,\r\nwho, in consequence, allowed me an unfettered course in the 'Publicist,'\r\nof which I availed myself to espouse the cause of 'The Martyrs' against\r\ntheir detractors.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was deeply affected by this, and hastened to express\r\nhis acknowledgments. My articles became the subject of a correspondence\r\nbetween us, which I still refer to with pleasure.[1] He explained to me\r\nhis intentions and motives in the composition of his poem, discussed\r\nwith susceptibility and even with some degree of temper concealed under\r\nhis gratitude, the strictures mixed with my eulogiums, and finished by\r\nsaying: \"In conclusion, Sir, you know the tempests raised against my\r\nwork, and from whence they proceed. There is another wound, not\r\nexhibited, which is the real source of all this rage. It is that\r\n_Hierocles_ massacres the Christians in the name of _philosophy_ and\r\n_liberty_. Time will do me justice, if my work deserves it, and you will\r\ngreatly accelerate this justice by the publication of your articles,\r\nprovided you could be induced to change and modify them to a certain\r\npoint. Show me my faults, and I will correct them. I only despise those\r\ncritics who are as base in their language as in the secret motives which\r\ninduce them to speak. I can find neither reason nor principle in the\r\nmouths of those literary mountebanks hired by the police, who dance in\r\nthe gutters for the amusement of lacqueys.... I do not give up the hope\r\nof calling to see you, or of receiving you in my hermitage. Honest men\r\nshould, particularly at present, unite for mutual consolation; generous\r\nfeelings and exalted sentiments become every day so rare, that we ought\r\nto consider ourselves too happy when we encounter them.... Accept, I\r\nentreat you, once more, the assurance of my high consideration, of my\r\nsincere devotion, and if you will permit, of a friendship which we\r\ncommence under the auspices of frankness and honour.\"\r\n\r\nBetween M. de Chateaubriand and myself, frankness and honour, most\r\ncertainly, have never been disturbed throughout our political\r\ncontroversies; but friendship has not been able to survive them. The\r\nword is too rare and valuable to be hastily pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhen we have lived under a system of real and serious liberty, we feel\r\nboth an inclination and a right to smile when we consider what, in other\r\ntimes, has been classed as factious opposition by the one side, and\r\ncourageous resistance by the other. In August, 1807, eighteen months\r\nbefore the publication of 'The Martyrs,' I stopped some days in\r\nSwitzerland, on my way to visit my mother at Nismes; and with the\r\nconfident enthusiasm of youth, as anxious to become acquainted with\r\nliving celebrities as I was myself unknown, I addressed a letter to\r\nMadame de Stael, requesting the honour of calling upon her. She invited\r\nme to dinner at Ouchy, near Lausanne, where she then resided. I was\r\nplaced next to her; I came from Paris; she questioned me as to what was\r\npassing there, how the public were occupied, and what were the topics\r\nof conversation in the saloons. I spoke of an article by\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, in the 'Mercury,' which was making some noise at\r\nthe moment of my departure. A particular passage had struck me, which I\r\nquoted according to the text, as it had strongly impressed itself on my\r\nmemory. \"When, in the silence of abject submission, we hear only the\r\nchains of the slave and the voice of the informer, when all tremble\r\nbefore the tyrant, and it is as dangerous to incur favour as to merit\r\ndisgrace, the historian appears to be charged with the vengeance of\r\nnations. It is in vain that Nero triumphs. Tacitus has been born in the\r\nEmpire; he grows up unnoticed near the ashes of Germanicus, and already\r\nuncompromising Providence has handed over to an obscure child the glory\r\nof the master of the world.\" My tone of voice was undoubtedly excited\r\nand striking, as I was myself deeply moved and arrested by the words.\r\nMadame de Stael, seizing me by the arm, exclaimed, \"I am sure you would\r\nmake an excellent tragedian; remain with us and take a part in the\r\n'Andromache.'\" Theatricals were at that time the prevailing taste and\r\namusement in her house. I excused myself from her kind conjecture and\r\nproposal, and the conversation returned to M. de Chateaubriand and his\r\narticle, which was greatly admired, while at the same time it excited\r\nsome apprehension. The admiration was just, for the passage was really\r\neloquent; neither was the alarm without grounds, for the 'Mercury' was\r\nsuppressed precisely on account of this identical paragraph. Thus, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, conqueror of Europe and absolute master of France,\r\nbelieved that he could not suffer it to be written that his future\r\nhistorian might perhaps be born under his reign, and held himself\r\ncompelled to take the honour of Nero under his shield. It was a heavy\r\npenalty attached to greatness, to have such apprehensions to exhibit,\r\nand such clients to protect!\r\n\r\nExalted minds, who felt a little for the dignity of human nature, had\r\nsound reason for being discontented with the existing system; they saw\r\nthat it could neither establish the happiness nor the permanent\r\nprosperity of France; but it seemed then so firmly established in\r\ngeneral opinion, its power was so universally admitted, and so little\r\nwas any change anticipated for the future, that even within the haughty\r\nand narrow circle in which the spirit of opposition prevailed, it\r\nappeared quite natural that young men should enter the service of\r\nGovernment, the only public career that remained open to them. A lady of\r\ndistinguished talent and noble sentiments, who had conceived a certain\r\ndegree of friendship for me, Madame de Remusat, was desirous that I\r\nshould be named Auditor in the State Council. Her cousin, M. Pasquier,\r\nPrefect of Police, whom I sometimes met at her house, interested himself\r\nin this matter with much cordiality, and, under the advice of my most\r\nintimate friends, I acceded to the proposition, although, at the bottom\r\nof my heart, it occasioned me some uneasiness. It was intended that I\r\nshould be attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. M. Pasquier named\r\nme to the Duke of Bassano, then at the head of the department, and to\r\nCount d'Hauterive, Comptroller of the Archives. The Duke sent for me. I\r\nalso had an interview with M. d'Hauterive, who possessed a fertile and\r\ningenious mind, and was kindly disposed towards young men of studious\r\nhabits. As a trial of ability, they ordered me to draw up a memorial on\r\na question respecting which, the Emperor either was, or wished to\r\nappear, deeply interested--the mutual exchange of French and English\r\nprisoners. Many documents on the subject were placed in my hands. I\r\ncompleted the memorial; and, believing that the Emperor was sincere,\r\ncarefully set forward those principles of the law of nations which\r\nrendered the measure desirable, and the mutual concessions necessary for\r\nits accomplishment. My work was duly submitted to the Duke of Bassano. I\r\nhave reason to conclude that I had mistaken his object; and that the\r\nEmperor, looking upon the English detained in France as of more\r\nimportance than the French confined in England, and believing also that\r\nthe number of the latter pressed inconveniently on the English\r\nGovernment, had no serious intention of carrying out the proposed\r\nexchange. Whatever might be the cause, I heard nothing more either of my\r\nmemorial or nomination, a result which caused me little regret.\r\n\r\nAnother career soon opened to me, more suitable to my views, as being\r\nless connected with the Government. My first attempts at writing,\r\nparticularly my Critical Notes on Gibbon's 'History of the Decline and\r\nFall of the Roman Empire,' and the 'Annals of Education,' a periodical\r\nmiscellany in which I had touched upon some leading questions of public\r\nand private instruction, obtained for me the notice of literary men.[2]\r\nWith gratuitous kindness, M. de Fontanes, Grand Master of the\r\nUniversity, appointed me Assistant Professor to the Chair of History,\r\noccupied by M. de Lacretelle, in the Faculty of Letters in the Academy\r\nof Paris. In a very short time, and before I had commenced my class, as\r\nif he thought he had not done enough to evince his esteem and to attach\r\nme strongly to the University, he divided the Chair, and named me\r\nTitular Professor of Modern History, with a dispensation on account of\r\nage, as I had not yet completed my twenty-fifth year. I began my\r\nlectures at the College of Plessis, in presence of the pupils of the\r\nNormal School, and of a public audience few in number but anxious for\r\ninstruction, and with whom modern history, traced up to its remote\r\nsources, the barbarous conquerors of the Roman Empire, presented itself\r\nwith an urgent and almost contemporaneous interest. In his conduct\r\ntowards me, M. de Fontanes was not entirely actuated by some pages of\r\nmine he had read, or by a few friendly opinions he had heard expressed.\r\nThis learned Epicurean, become powerful, and the intellectual favourite\r\nof the most potent Sovereign in Europe, loved literature for itself with\r\na sincere and disinterested attachment. The truly beautiful touched him\r\nas sensibly as in the days of his early youth and poetical inspirations.\r\nWhat was still more extraordinary, this refined courtier of a despot,\r\nthis official orator, who felt satisfied when he had embellished\r\nflattery with noble eloquence, never failed to acknowledge, and render\r\ndue homage to independence. Soon after my appointment, he invited me to\r\ndinner at his country-house at Courbevoie. Seated near him at table, we\r\ntalked of studies, of the different modes of teaching, of ancient and\r\nmodern classics, with the freedom of old acquaintances, and almost with\r\nthe association of fellow-labourers. The conversation turned upon the\r\nLatin poets and their commentators. I spoke with warm praise of the\r\ngreat edition of Virgil by Heyne, the celebrated professor of the\r\nUniversity of Goettingen, and of the merit of his annotations.\r\nM. de Fontanes fiercely attacked the German scholars. According to him,\r\nthey had neither discovered nor added anything to the earlier\r\ncommentaries, and Heyne was no better acquainted with Virgil and the\r\nancients than Pere La Rue. He fulminated against German literature in\r\nthe mass, philosophers, poets, historians, or philologists, and\r\npronounced them all unworthy of attention. I defended them with the\r\nconfidence of conviction and youth; when M. de Fontanes, turning to his\r\nneighbour on the other side, said to him, with a smile, \"We can never\r\nmake these Protestants give in.\" But, instead of taking offence at my\r\nobstinacy, he was cordially pleased with the frankness of this little\r\ndebate. His toleration of my independence was, not long after, subjected\r\nto a more delicate trial.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about to commence my course, in December, 1812, he spoke to\r\nme of my opening address, and insinuated that I ought to insert in it a\r\nsentence or two in praise of the Emperor. It was the custom, he said,\r\nparticularly on the establishment of a new professorship, and the\r\nEmperor sometimes demanded from him an account of these proceedings. I\r\nfelt unwilling to comply, and told him, I thought this proposal scarcely\r\nconsistent. I had to deal exclusively with science, before an audience\r\nof students; how then could I be expected to introduce politics, and,\r\nabove all, politics in opposition to my own views? \"Do as you please,\"\r\nreplied M. de Fontanes, with an evident mixture of regard and\r\nembarrassment; \"if you are complained of, it will fall upon me, and I\r\nmust defend you and myself as well as I can.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHe displayed as much clear penetration and good sense as generosity, in\r\nso quickly and gracefully renouncing the proposition he had suggested.\r\nIn regard to the master he served, the opposition of the society in\r\nwhich I lived had in it nothing of practical or immediate importance. It\r\nwas purely an opposition of ideas and conversation, without defined plan\r\nor effective influence, earnest in philosophic inquiry, but passive in\r\npolitical action; disposed to be satisfied with tranquil life, in the\r\nunshackled indulgence of thought and speech.\r\n\r\nOn entering the University, I found myself in contact with another\r\nopposition, less apparent but more serious, without being, at the\r\nmoment, of a more active character. M. Royer-Collard, at that time\r\nProfessor of the History of Philosophy, and Dean of the Faculty of\r\nLetters, attached himself to me with warm friendship. We had no previous\r\nacquaintanceship; I was much the younger man; he lived quite out of the\r\nworld, within a small circle of selected associates; we were new to each\r\nother, and mutually attractive. He was a man, not of the old system, but\r\nof the old times, whose character had been developed, though not\r\ncontrolled, by the Revolution, the principles, transactions, and\r\nleading promoters of which he judged with rigid independence, without\r\nlosing sight of the primary and national cause. His mind, eminently\r\nliberal, highly cultivated, and supported by solid good sense, was more\r\noriginal than inventive, profound rather than expanded, more given to\r\nsift thoroughly a single idea than to combine many; too much absorbed\r\nwithin himself, but exercising a singular power over others by the\r\ncommanding weight of his reason, and by an aptitude of imparting, with a\r\ncertain solemnity of manner, the unexpected brilliancy of a strong\r\nimagination, continually under the excitement of very lively\r\nimpressions. Before being called to teach philosophy, he had never made\r\nthis particular branch of science the object or end of his special\r\nstudy, and throughout our political vicissitudes between 1789 and 1814\r\nhe had never taken an important position, or connected himself\r\nprominently with any party. But, in youth, under the influence of the\r\ntraditions of Port-Royal, he had received a sound classical and\r\nChristian education; and after the _Reign of Terror_, under the\r\ngovernment of the Directory, he joined the small section of Royalists\r\nwho corresponded with Louis XVIII., less to conspire, than to enlighten\r\nthe exiled Prince on the true state of the country, and to furnish him\r\nwith suggestions equally advantageous for France and the House of\r\nBourbon, if it were destined that the House of Bourbon and France should\r\nbe re-united on some future day. He was therefore decidedly a\r\nspiritualist in philosophy, and a royalist in politics. To restore\r\nindependence of mind to man, and right to government, formed the\r\nprevailing desire of his unobtrusive life. \"You cannot believe,\" he\r\nwrote to me in 1823, \"that I have ever adopted the word _Restoration_ in\r\nthe restricted sense of an individual fact; but I have always regarded,\r\nand still look upon this fact as the expression of a certain system of\r\nsociety and government, and as the condition on which, under the\r\ncircumstances of France, we are to look for order, justice, and liberty;\r\nwhile, without this condition, disorder, violence, and irremediable\r\ndespotism, springing from things and not from men, will be the necessary\r\nconsequence of the spirit and doctrines of the Revolution.\" Passionately\r\nimbued with this conviction, an aggressive philosopher and an expectant\r\npolitician, he fought successfully in his chair against the\r\nmaterialistic school of the eighteenth century, and watched from the\r\nretirement of his study, with anxiety but not without hope, the chances\r\nof the perilous game on which Napoleon daily staked his empire.\r\n\r\nBy his lofty and intuitive instincts, Napoleon was a spiritualist: men\r\nof his order have flashes of light and impulses of thought, which open\r\nto them the sphere of the most exalted truths. In his hours of better\r\nreflection, spiritualism, reviving under his reign, and sapping the\r\nmaterialism of the last century, was sympathetic with and agreeable to\r\nhis own nature. But the principle of despotism quickly reminded him that\r\nthe soul cannot be elevated without enfranchisement, and the\r\nspiritualistic philosophy of M. Royer-Collard then confused him as much\r\nas the sensual ideology of M. de Tracy. It was, moreover, one of the\r\npeculiarities of Napoleon's mind, that his thoughts constantly reverted\r\nto the forgotten Bourbons, well knowing that he had no other\r\ncompetitors for the throne of France. At the summit of his power he\r\nmore than once gave utterance to this impression, which recurred to him\r\nwith increased force when he felt the approach of danger. On this\r\nground, M. Royer-Collard and his friends, with whose opinions and\r\nconnections he was fully acquainted, became to him objects of extreme\r\nsuspicion and disquietude. Not that their opposition (as he was also\r\naware) was either active or influential; events were not produced\r\nthrough such agencies; but therein lay the best-founded presentiments of\r\nthe future; and amongst its members were included the most rational\r\npartisans of the prospective Government.\r\n\r\nHitherto they had ventured nothing beyond vague and half-indulged\r\nconversations, when the Emperor himself advanced their views to a\r\nconsistence and publicity which they were far from assuming. On the 19th\r\nof December, 1813, he convened together the Senate and the Legislative\r\nBody, and ordered several documents to be laid before them relative to\r\nhis negotiations with the Allied Powers, demanding their opinions on the\r\nsubject. If he had then really intended to make peace, or felt seriously\r\nanxious to convince France, that the continuance of the war would not\r\nspring from the obstinacy of his own domineering will, there can be no\r\ndoubt that he would have found in these two Bodies, enervated as they\r\nwere, a strong and popular support. I often saw and talked\r\nconfidentially with three of the five members of the Commission of the\r\nLegislative Body, MM. Maine-Biran, Gallois, and Raynouard, and through\r\nthem I obtained a correct knowledge of the dispositions of the two\r\nothers, MM. Laine and Flaugergues. M. Maine-Biran, who, with\r\nM. Royer-Collard and myself formed a small philosophical association, in\r\nwhich we conversed freely on all topics, kept us fully informed as to\r\nwhat passed in the Commission, and even in the Legislative Assembly\r\nitself. Although originally a Royalist (in his youth he had been\r\nenrolled amongst the bodyguards of Louis XVI.), he was unconnected with\r\nany party or intrigue, scrupulously conscientious, even timid when\r\nconviction did not call for the exercise of courage, little inclined to\r\npolitics by taste, and, under any circumstances, one of the last men\r\nto form an extreme resolution, or take the initiative in action.\r\nM. Gallois, a man of the world and of letters, a moderate liberal of the\r\nphilosophic school of the eighteenth century, occupied himself much more\r\nwith his library than with public affairs. He wished to discharge his\r\nduty to his country respectably, without disturbing the peaceful tenor\r\nof his life. M. Raynouard, a native of Provence and a poet, had more\r\nvivacity of manner and language, without being of an adventurous\r\ntemperament. It was said that his loud complaints against the tyrannical\r\nabuses of the Imperial Government, would not have prevented him from\r\nbeing contented with those moderate concessions which satisfy honour for\r\nthe present, and excite hope for the future. M. Flaugergues, an honest\r\nRepublican, who had put on mourning for the death of Louis XVI.,\r\nuncompromising in temper and character, was capable of energetic but\r\nsolitary resolutions, and possessed little influence over his\r\ncolleagues, although he talked much. M. Laine, on the contrary, had a\r\nwarm and sympathetic heart under a gloomy exterior, and an elevated\r\nmind, without much vigour or originality. He spoke imposingly and\r\nconvincingly when moved by his subject; formerly a Republican, he had\r\npaused as a simple partisan of liberal tendencies, and being promptly\r\nacknowledged as the head of the Commission, consented without hesitation\r\nto become its organ. But, like his colleagues, he had no premeditated\r\nhostility or concealed engagement against the Emperor. All were desirous\r\nof conveying to him a true impression of the desires of France;\r\nexternally for a pacific policy, and internally for a respect for public\r\nrights and the legal exercise of power. Their Report contained nothing\r\nbeyond a guarded expression of these moderate sentiments.\r\n\r\nWith such men, animated by such views, a perfect understanding was\r\nanything but difficult. Napoleon would not even listen to them. It is\r\nwell known how he suddenly suppressed the Report and adjourned the\r\nLegislative Body, and with what rude but intentional violence he\r\nreceived the Deputies and their Commissioners on the 1st of January,\r\n1814. \"Who are you who address me thus? I am the sole representative of\r\nthe nation. We are one and inseparable. I have a title, but you have\r\nnone.... M. Laine, your mouthpiece, is a dishonest man who corresponds\r\nwith England through the Advocate Deseze. I shall keep my eye upon him.\r\nM. Raynouard is a liar.\" In communicating to the Commission the papers\r\nconnected with the negotiation, Napoleon had forbidden his Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, the Duke of Vicenza, to include that which specified\r\nthe conditions on which the Allied Powers were prepared to treat, not\r\nwishing to pledge himself to any recognized basis. His Minister of\r\nPolice, the Duke of Rovigo, took upon himself to carry to extremity the\r\nindiscretion of his anger. \"Your words are most imprudent,\" said he to\r\nthe members of the Commission, \"when there is a Bourbon in the field.\"\r\nThus, in the very crisis of his difficulties, under the most emphatic\r\nwarnings from heaven and man, the despot at bay made an empty parade of\r\nabsolute power; the vanquished conqueror displayed to the world that the\r\nostensible negotiations were only a pretext for still trying the chances\r\nof war; the tottering head of the new dynasty proclaimed himself that\r\nthe old line was there, ready to supplant him.\r\n\r\nThe day had arrived when glory could no longer repair the faults which\r\nit still covers. The campaign of 1814, that uninterrupted masterpiece of\r\nskill and heroism, as well on the part of the leader as of his\r\nfollowers, bore, nevertheless, the ineffaceable stamp of the false\r\ncalculations and false position of the Emperor. He wavered continually\r\nbetween the necessity of protecting Paris, and the passion of\r\nreconquering Europe; anxious to save his throne without sacrificing his\r\nambition, and changing his tactics at every moment, as a fatal danger or\r\na favourable change alternately presented itself. God vindicated reason\r\nand justice, by condemning the genius which had so recklessly braved\r\nboth, to sink in hesitation and uncertainty, under the weight of its own\r\nincompatible objects and impracticable desires.\r\n\r\nWhile Napoleon in this closing struggle wasted the last remnants of his\r\nfortune and power, he encountered no disappointment or obstacle from any\r\nquarter of France, either from Paris or the departments, the party in\r\nopposition, or the public in general. There was no enthusiasm in his\r\ncause, and little confidence in his success, but no one rose openly\r\nagainst him; all hostility was comprised in a few unfavourable\r\nexpressions, some preparatory announcements, and here and there a change\r\nof side as people began to catch a glimpse of the approaching issue. The\r\nEmperor acted in full liberty, with all the strength that still\r\npertained to his isolated position, and the moral and physical\r\nexhaustion of the country. Such general apathy was never before\r\nexhibited in the midst of so much national anxiety, or so many\r\ndisaffected persons abstaining from action under similar circumstances,\r\nwith such numerous partisans ready to renounce the master they still\r\nserved with implicit docility. It was an entire nation of wearied\r\nspectators who had long given up all interference in their own fate, and\r\nknew not what catastrophe they were to hope or fear to the terrible game\r\nof which they were the stake.\r\n\r\nI grew impatient of remaining a motionless beholder of the shifting\r\nspectacle; and not foreseeing when or how it would terminate, I\r\ndetermined, towards the middle of March, to repair to Nismes, and pass\r\nsome weeks with my mother, whom I had not seen for a considerable time.\r\nI have still before my eyes the aspect of Paris, particularly of the Rue\r\nde Rivoli (then in progress of construction), as I passed along on the\r\nmorning of my departure. There were no workmen and no activity;\r\nmaterials heaped together without being used, deserted scaffoldings,\r\nbuildings abandoned for want of money, hands, or confidence, and in\r\nruins before completion. Everywhere, amongst the people, a discontented\r\nair of uneasy idleness, as if they were equally in want of labour and\r\nrepose. Throughout my journey, on the highways, in the towns, and in the\r\nfields, I noticed the same appearance of inactivity and agitation, the\r\nsame visible impoverishment of the country; there were more women and\r\nchildren than men, many young conscripts marching mournfully to their\r\nbattalions, sick and wounded soldiers returning to the interior; in\r\nfact, a mutilated and exhausted nation. Side by side with this physical\r\nsuffering, I also remarked a great moral perplexity, the uneasiness of\r\nopposing sentiments, an ardent longing for peace, a deadly hatred of\r\nforeign invaders, with alternating feelings, as regarded Napoleon, of\r\nanger and sympathy. By some he was denounced as the author of all their\r\ncalamities; by others he was hailed as the bulwark of the country, and\r\nthe avenger of her injuries. What struck me as a serious evil, although\r\nI was then far from being able to estimate its full extent, was the\r\nmarked inequality of these different expressions amongst the divided\r\nclasses of the population. With the affluent and educated, the prominent\r\nfeeling was evidently a strong desire for peace, a dislike of the\r\nexigencies and hazards of the Imperial despotism, a calculated\r\nforeshadowing of its fall, and the dawning perspective of another system\r\nof government. The lower orders, on the contrary, only roused themselves\r\nup from lassitude to give way to a momentary burst of patriotic rage, or\r\nto their reminiscences of the Revolution. The Imperial rule had given\r\nthem discipline without reform. Appearances were tranquil, but in truth\r\nit might be said of the popular masses as of the emigrants, that they\r\nhad forgotten nothing, and learned nothing. There was no moral unity\r\nthroughout the land, no common thought or passion, notwithstanding the\r\ncommon misfortunes and experience. The nation was almost as blindly and\r\ncompletely divided in its apathy, as it had lately been in its\r\nexcitement. I recognized these unwholesome symptoms; but I was young,\r\nand much more disposed to dwell on the hopes than on the perils of the\r\nfuture. While at Nismes, I soon became acquainted with the events that\r\nhad taken place in Paris. M. Royer-Collard wrote to press my return. I\r\nset out on the instant, and a few days after my arrival, I was appointed\r\nSecretary-General to the Ministry of the Interior, which department the\r\nKing had just confided to the Abbe de Montesquiou.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have inserted, amongst the \"Historic Documents\" at the\r\nend of the Volume, three of the letters which M. de Chateaubriand\r\naddressed to me, at the time, on this subject.

I\r\nhad no previous tie, no personal motive to connect me with the\r\nRestoration; I sprang from those who had been raised up by the impulse\r\nof 1789, and were little disposed to fall back again. But if I was not\r\nbound to the former system by any specific interest, I felt no\r\nbitterness towards the old Government of France. Born a citizen and a\r\nProtestant, I have ever been unswervingly devoted to liberty of\r\nconscience, equality in the eye of the law, and all the acquired\r\nprivileges of social order. My confidence in these acquisitions is\r\nample and confirmed; but, in support of their cause, I do not feel\r\nmyself called upon to consider the House of Bourbon, the aristocracy of\r\nFrance, and the Catholic clergy, in the light of enemies. At present,\r\nnone but madmen exclaim, \"Down with the nobility! Down with the\r\npriests!\" Nevertheless, many well-meaning and sensible persons, who are\r\nsincerely desirous that revolutions should cease, still cherish in their\r\nhearts some relics of the sentiments to which these cries respond. Let\r\nthem beware of such feelings. They are essentially revolutionary and\r\nantisocial; order can never be thoroughly re-established as long as\r\nhonourable minds encourage them with secret complaisance. I mean, that\r\nreal and enduring order which every extended society requires for its\r\nprosperity and permanence. The interests and acquired rights of the\r\npresent day have taken rank in France, and constitute henceforward the\r\nstrength and vitality of the country; but because our social system is\r\nfilled with new elements, it is not therefore new in itself; it can no\r\nmore deny what it has been, than it can renounce what it has become; it\r\nwould establish perpetual confusion and decline within itself, if it\r\nremained hostile to its true history. History is the nation, the\r\ncountry, viewed through ages. For myself, I have always maintained an\r\naffectionate respect for the great names and actions which have held\r\nsuch a conspicuous place in our destinies; and being as I am, a man of\r\nyesterday, when the King, Louis XVIII., presented himself with the\r\nCharter in his hand, I neither felt angry nor humiliated that I was\r\ncompelled to enjoy or defend our liberties under the ancient dynasty of\r\nthe Sovereigns of France, and in common with all Frenchmen, whether\r\nnoble or plebeian, even though their old rivalries might sometimes prove\r\na source of mistrust and agitation.\r\n\r\nIt was the remembrance of foreign intervention that constituted the\r\nwound and nightmare of France under the Government of the Restoration.\r\nThe feeling was legitimate in itself. The jealous passion of national\r\nindependence and glory doubles the strength of a people in prosperity,\r\nand saves their pride under reverses. If it had pleased Heaven to throw\r\nme into the ranks of Napoleon's soldiers, in all probability that single\r\npassion would also have governed my soul. But, placed as I was, in civil\r\nlife, other ideas and instincts have taught me to look elsewhere than to\r\npredominance in war for the greatness and security of my country. I have\r\never prized, above all other considerations, just policy, and liberty\r\nrestrained by law. I despaired of both under the Empire; I hoped for\r\nthem from the Restoration. I have been sometimes reproached with not\r\nsufficiently associating myself with general impressions. Whenever I\r\nmeet them sincerely and strongly manifested, I respect and hold them in\r\naccount, but I cannot feel that I am called upon to abdicate my reason\r\nfor their adoption, or to desert the real and permanent interest of the\r\ncountry for the sake of according with them. It is truly an absurd\r\ninjustice to charge the Restoration with the presence of those\r\nforeigners which the mad ambition of Napoleon alone brought upon our\r\nsoil, and which the Bourbons only could remove by a prompt and certain\r\npeace. The enemies of the Restoration, in their haste to condemn it\r\nfrom the very first hour, have plunged into strange contradictions. If\r\nwe are to put faith in their assertions, at one time they tell us that\r\nit was imposed on France by foreign bayonets; at another, that in 1814,\r\nno one, either in France or Europe, bestowed a thought upon the subject;\r\nand again, that a few old adherences, a few sudden defections, and a few\r\negotistical intrigues alone enabled it to prevail. Puerile blindness of\r\nparty spirit! The more it is attempted to prove that no general desire,\r\nno prevailing force, from within or without, either suggested or\r\nproduced the Restoration, the more its inherent strength will be brought\r\nto light, and the controlling necessity which determined the event. I\r\nhave ever been surprised that free and superior minds should thus fetter\r\nthemselves within the subtleties and credulities of prejudice, and not\r\nfeel the necessity of looking facts in the face, and of viewing them as\r\nthey really exist. In the formidable crisis of 1814, the restoration of\r\nthe House of Bourbon was the only natural and solid solution that\r\npresented itself; the only measure that could be reconciled to\r\nprinciples not dependent on the influence of force and the caprices of\r\nhuman will. Some alarm might thence be excited for the new interests of\r\nFrench society; but with the aid of institutions mutually accepted, the\r\ntwo benefits of which France stood most in need, and of which for\r\ntwenty-five years she had been utterly deprived, peace and liberty,\r\nmight also be confidently looked for. Under the influence of this double\r\nhope, the Restoration was accomplished, not only without effort, but in\r\ndespite of revolutionary remembrances, and was received throughout\r\nFrance with alacrity and cheerfulness. And France did wisely in this\r\nadoption, for the Restoration, in fact, came accompanied by peace and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nPeace had never been more talked of in France than during the last\r\nquarter of a century. The Constituent Assembly had proclaimed, \"No more\r\nconquests;\" the National Convention had celebrated the union of nations;\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon had concluded, in fifteen years, more pacific\r\nnegotiations than any preceding monarch. Never had war so frequently\r\nended and recommenced; never had peace proved such a transient illusion;\r\na treaty was nothing but a truce, during which preparations were making\r\nfor fresh combats.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with liberty as with peace. Celebrated and promised, at\r\nfirst, with enthusiasm, it had quickly disappeared under civil discord,\r\neven before the celebration and the promise had ceased; thus, to\r\nextinguish discord, liberty had also been abolished. At one moment\r\npeople became maddened with the word, without caring for the reality of\r\nthe fact; at another, to escape a fatal intoxication, the fact and the\r\nword were equally proscribed and forgotten.\r\n\r\nTrue peace and liberty returned with the Restoration. War was not with\r\nthe Bourbons a necessity or a passion; they could reign without having\r\nrecourse every day to some new development of force, some fresh shock to\r\nthe fixed principles of nations. Treating with them, foreign Governments\r\ncould and did believe in a sincere and lasting peace. Neither was the\r\nliberty which France recovered in 1814, the triumph of any particular\r\nschool in philosophy or party in politics. Turbulent propensities,\r\nobstinate theories and imaginations, at the same time ardent and idle,\r\nwere unable to find in it the gratification of their irregular and\r\nunbounded appetites. It was, in truth, social liberty, the practical and\r\nlegalized enjoyment of rights, equally essential to the active life of\r\nthe citizens and to the moral dignity of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhat were to be the guarantees of liberty, and consequently of all the\r\ninterests which liberty itself was intended to guarantee? By what\r\ninstitutions could the control and influence of the nation in its\r\ngovernment be exercised? In these questions lay the great problem which\r\nthe Imperial Senate attempted to solve by its project of a Constitution\r\nin April, 1814, and which, on the 4th of June following, the King, Louis\r\nXVIII., effectually decided by the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe Senators of 1814 have been much and justly reproached for the\r\nselfishness with which, on overthrowing the Empire, they preserved for\r\nthemselves, not only the integrity, but the perpetuity of the material\r\nadvantages with which the Empire had endowed them;--a cynical error, and\r\none of those which most depreciate existing authorities in the\r\nestimation of the people, for they are offensive, at the same time, to\r\nhonest feelings and envious passions. The Senate committed another\r\nmistake less palpable, and more consistent with the prejudices of the\r\ncountry, but in my judgment more weighty, both as a political blunder,\r\nand as to the consequences involved. At the same moment when it\r\nproclaimed the return of the ancient Royal House, it blazoned forth the\r\npretension of electing the King, disavowing the monarchical right, the\r\nsupremacy of which it accepted, and thus exercising the privilege of\r\nrepublicanism in re-establishing the monarchy:--a glaring contradiction\r\nbetween principles and acts, a childish bravado against the great fact\r\nto which it was rendering homage, and a lamentable confounding of rights\r\nand ideas. It was from necessity, and not by choice, on account of his\r\nhereditary title, and not as the chosen candidate of the day, that Louis\r\nXVIII. was called to the throne of France. There was neither truth,\r\ndignity, nor prudence, but in one line of conduct,--to recognize openly\r\nthe royal claim in the House of Bourbon, and to demand as openly in\r\nreturn the national privileges which the state of the country and the\r\nspirit of the time required. Such a candid avowal and mutual respect for\r\nmutual rights, form the very essence of free government. It is by this\r\nsteady union that elsewhere monarchy and liberty have developed and\r\nstrengthened themselves together; and by frank co-operation, kings and\r\nnations have extinguished those internal wars which are denominated\r\nrevolutions. Instead of adopting this course, the Senate, at once\r\nobstinate and timid, while wishing to place the restored monarchy under\r\nthe standard of republican election, succeeded only in evoking the\r\ndespotic in face of the revolutionary principle, and in raising up as a\r\nrival to the absolute right of the people, the uncontrolled authority of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nThe Charter bore the impress of this impolitic conduct; timid and\r\nobstinate in its turn, and seeking to cover the retreat of royalty, as\r\nthe Revolution had sought to protect its own, it replied to the\r\npretensions of the revolutionary system by the pretensions of the\r\nancient form, and presented itself as purely a royal concession, instead\r\nof proclaiming its true character, such as it really was, a treaty of\r\npeace after a protracted war, a series of new articles added by common\r\naccord to the old compact of union between the nation and the King.\r\n\r\nIn this point lay the complaint of the Liberals of the Revolution\r\nagainst the Charter, as soon as it appeared. Their adversaries, the\r\nsupporters of the old rule, assailed it with other reproaches. The most\r\nfiery, such as the disciples of M. de Maistre, could scarcely tolerate\r\nits existence. According to them, absolute power, legitimate in itself\r\nalone, was the only form of government that suited France. The\r\nmoderates, amongst whom were M. de Villele in the reply he published at\r\nToulouse to the declaration of Saint-Ouen, accused this plan for a\r\nconstitution, which became the Charter, of being an importation from\r\nEngland, foreign to the history, the ideas, and the manners of France;\r\nand which, they said, \"would cost more to establish than the ancient\r\norganization would require for repairs.\"\r\n\r\nI do not here propose to enter upon any discussion of principles, with\r\nthe apostles of absolute power; as applied to France and our own time,\r\nexperience, and a very overwhelming experience, has supplied an answer.\r\nAbsolute power, amongst us, can only belong to the Revolution and its\r\nrepresentatives, for they alone can (I do not say for how long) retain\r\nthe masses in their interest, by withholding from them the securities of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nFor the House of Bourbon and its supporters, absolute power is\r\nimpossible; under them France must be free; it only accepts their\r\ngovernment by supplying it with the eye and the hand.\r\n\r\nThe objections of the moderate party were more specious. It must be\r\nadmitted that the government established by the Charter had, in its\r\nforms at least, something of a foreign aspect. Perhaps too there was\r\nreason for saying that it assumed the existence of a stronger\r\naristocratic element in France, and of a more trained and disciplined\r\nspirit of policy, than could, in reality, be found there. Another\r\ndifficulty, less palpable but substantial, awaited it; the Charter was\r\nnot alone the triumph of 1789 over the old institutions, but it was the\r\nvictory of one of the Liberal sections of 1789 over its rivals as well\r\nas its enemies, a victory of the partisans of the English Constitution\r\nover the framers of the Constitution of 1791, and over the republicans\r\nas well as the supporters of the ancient monarchy,--a source teeming\r\nwith offences to the self-love of many, and a somewhat narrow basis for\r\nthe re-settlement of an old and extensive country.\r\n\r\nBut these objections had little weight in 1814. The position of affairs\r\nwas urgent and imperative; it was necessary that the old monarchy should\r\nbe reformed when restored. Of all the measures of improvement proposed\r\nor attempted since 1789, the Charter comprised that which was the most\r\ngenerally recognized and admitted by the public at large, as well as by\r\nprofessed politicians. At such moments controversy subsides; the\r\nresolutions adopted by men of action, present an epitome of the ideas\r\ncommon to men of thought. A republic would be to revive the Revolution;\r\nthe Constitution of 1791 would be government without power; the old\r\nFrench Constitution, if the name were applicable, had been found\r\nineffective in 1789, equally incapable of self-maintenance or\r\namelioration. All that it had once possessed of greatness or utility,\r\nthe Parliaments, the different Orders, the various local institutions,\r\nwere so evidently beyond the possibility of re-establishment, that no\r\none thought seriously of such a proposition. The Charter was already\r\nwritten in the experience and reflection of the country. It emanated as\r\nnaturally from the mind of Louis XVIII., returning from England, as from\r\nthe deliberations of the Senate, intent on renouncing the yoke of the\r\nEmpire. It was the produce of the necessities and convictions of the\r\nhour. Judged by itself, notwithstanding its inherent defects and the\r\nobjections of opponents, the Charter was a very practicable political\r\nimplement. Power and liberty found ample scope there for exercise and\r\ndefence; the workmen were much less adapted to the machine than the\r\nmachine to the work.\r\n\r\nThoroughly distinguished from each other in ideas and character, and\r\nextremely unequal in mind and merit, the three leading Ministers of\r\nLouis XVIII. at that epoch, M. de Talleyrand, the Abbe de Montesquiou,\r\nand M. de Blacas, were all specially unsuited to the government they\r\nwere called on to found.\r\n\r\nI say only what I truly think; yet I do not feel myself compelled, in\r\nspeaking of those with whom I have come in contact, to say all that I\r\nthink. I owe nothing to M. de Talleyrand; in my public career he\r\nthwarted rather than assisted me; but when we have been much associated\r\nwith an eminent man, and have long reciprocated amicable intercourse,\r\nself-respect renders it imperative to speak of him with a certain degree\r\nof reserve. At the crisis of the Restoration, M. de Talleyrand\r\ndisplayed, in a very superior manner, the qualities of sagacity, cool\r\ndetermination, and preponderating influence. Not long after, at Vienna,\r\nhe manifested the same endowments, and others even more rare and\r\napposite, when representing the House of Bourbon and the European\r\ninterests of France. But except in a crisis or a congress, he was\r\nneither able nor powerful. A courtier and a politician, no advocate upon\r\nconviction, for any particular form of government, and less for\r\nrepresentative government than for any other, he excelled in negotiating\r\nwith insulated individuals, by the power of conversation, by the charm\r\nand skilful employment of social relations; but in authority of\r\ncharacter, in fertility of mental resources, in promptitude of\r\nresolution, in command of language, in the sympathetic association of\r\ngeneral ideas with public passions,--in all these great sources of\r\ninfluence upon collected assemblies, he was absolutely deficient.\r\nBesides which, he had neither the inclination nor habit of sustained,\r\nsystematic labour, another important condition of internal government.\r\nHe was at once ambitious and indolent, a flatterer and a scoffer, a\r\nconsummate courtier in the art of pleasing and of serving without the\r\nappearance of servility; ready for everything, and capable of any\r\npliability that might assist his fortune, preserving always the mien,\r\nand recurring at need to the attractions of independence; a diplomatist\r\nwithout scruples, indifferent as to means, and almost equally careless\r\nas to the end, provided only that the end advanced his personal\r\ninterest. More bold than profound in his views, calmly courageous in\r\ndanger, well suited to the great enterprises of absolute government, but\r\ninsensible to the true atmosphere and light of liberty, in which he felt\r\nhimself lost and incapable of action. He was too glad to escape from the\r\nChambers and from France, to find once more at Vienna a congenial sphere\r\nand associations.\r\n\r\nAs completely a courtier as M. de Talleyrand, and more thoroughly\r\nbelonging to the old system, the Abbe de Montesquiou was better suited\r\nto hold his ground under a constitutional government, and occupied a\r\nmore favourable position for such a purpose, at this period of\r\nuncertainty. He stood high in the estimation of the King and the\r\nRoyalists, having ever remained immovably faithful to his cause, his\r\norder, his friends, and his sovereign. He was in no danger of being\r\ntaxed as a revolutionist, or of having his name associated with\r\nunpleasant reminiscences. Through a rare disinterestedness, and the\r\nconsistent simplicity of his life, he had won the confidence of all\r\nhonest men. His character was open, his disposition frank, his mind\r\nrichly cultivated, and his conversation unreserved, without being\r\nexceptious as to those with whom he might be conversing. He could render\r\nhimself acceptable to the middle classes, although indications of pride\r\nand aristocratic haughtiness might be occasionally detected in his words\r\nand manner. These symptoms were only perceptible to delicate\r\ninvestigators; by the great majority he was considered affable and\r\nunassuming. In the Chambers he spoke with ease and animation, if not\r\nwith eloquence, and often indulged in an attractive play of fancy. He\r\ncould have rendered good service to the constitutional government, had\r\nhe either loved or trusted it; but he joined it without faith or\r\npreference, as a measure of necessity, to be evaded or restrained even\r\nduring the term of endurance. Through habit, and deference for his\r\nparty, or rather for his immediate coterie, he was perpetually recurring\r\nto the traditions and tendencies of the old system, and endeavouring to\r\ncarry his listeners with him by shallow subtleties and weak arguments,\r\nwhich were sometimes retorted upon himself. One day, partly in jest, and\r\npartly in earnest, he proposed to M. Royer-Collard to obtain for him\r\nfrom the King the title of Count. \"Count?\" replied M. Royer-Collard, in\r\nthe same tone, \"make yourself a Count?\" The Abbe de Montesquieu smiled,\r\nwith a slight expression of disappointment, at this freak of citizen\r\npride. He believed the old aristocracy to be beaten down, but he wished\r\nto revive and strengthen it by an infusion with the new orders. He\r\nmiscalculated in supposing that none amongst the latter class would,\r\nfrom certain instinctive tendencies, think lightly of a title which\r\nflattered their interests, or that they could be won over by\r\nconciliation without sympathy. He was a thoroughly honourable man, with\r\na heart more liberal than his ideas, of an enlightened and accomplished\r\nmind, naturally elegant, but volatile, inconsiderate, and absent; little\r\nsuited for long and bitter contentions, formed to please rather than to\r\ncontrol, and incapable of leading his party or himself in the course in\r\nwhich reason suggested that they should follow.\r\n\r\nIn the character of M. de Blacas there were no such apparent\r\ninconsistencies. Not that he was either an ardent, or a decided and\r\nstirring partisan of the contra-revolutionary reaction; he was moderate\r\nthrough coldness of temperament, and a fear of compromising the King, to\r\nwhom he was sincerely devoted, rather than from clear penetration. But\r\nneither his moderation nor his loyalty gave him any insight into the\r\ntrue state of the country, or any desire to occupy himself with the\r\nsubject. He remained at the Tuileries what he had been at Hartwell, a\r\ncountry gentleman, an emigrant, a courtier, and a steady and courageous\r\nfavourite, not deficient in personal dignity or domestic tact, but with\r\nno political genius, no ambition, no statesmanlike activity, and almost\r\nas entirely a stranger to France as before his return. He impeded the\r\nGovernment more than he pretended to govern, taking a larger share in\r\nthe quarrels and intrigues of the palace, than in the deliberations of\r\nthe Council, and doing much more injury to public affairs by utter\r\nneglect, than by direct interference.\r\n\r\nI do not think it would have been impossible for an active, determined\r\nmonarch to employ these three ministers profitably, and at the same\r\ntime, however much they differed from one another. Neither of them\r\naspired to the helm, and each, in his proper sphere, could have rendered\r\ngood service. M. de Talleyrand desired nothing better than to negotiate\r\nwith Europe; the Abbe de Montesquiou had no desire to rule at court, and\r\nM. de Blacas, calm, prudent, and faithful, might have been found a\r\nvaluable confidant in opposition to the pretensions and secret intrigues\r\nof courtiers and princes. But Louis XVIII. was not in the least capable\r\nof governing his ministers. As a King he possessed great negative or\r\npromissory qualities, but few that were active and immediate. Outwardly\r\nimposing, judicious, acute, and circumspect, he could reconcile,\r\nrestrain, and defeat; but he could neither inspire, direct, nor give the\r\nimpulse while he held the reins. He had few ideas, and no passion.\r\nPersevering application to business was as little suited to him, as\r\nactive movement. He sufficiently maintained his rank, his rights, and\r\nhis power, and seldom committed a glaring mistake; but when once his\r\ndignity and prudence were vindicated, he allowed things to take their\r\nown course; with too little energy of mind and body to control men, and\r\nforce them to act in concert for the accomplishment of his wishes.\r\n\r\nFrom my inexperience, and the nature of my secondary post in a special\r\ndepartment, I was far from perceiving the full mischief of this\r\nabsence of unity and supreme direction in the Government. The\r\nAbbe de Montesquiou sometimes mentioned it to me with impatience and\r\nregret. He was amongst the few who had sufficient sense and honesty not\r\nto deceive themselves as to their own defects. He reposed great\r\nconfidence in me, although even within his most intimate circle of\r\nassociates, efforts had been made to check this disposition. With\r\ngenerous irony, he replied to those who objected to me as a Protestant,\r\n\"Do you think I intend to make him Pope?\" With his habitual unrestraint,\r\nhe communicated to me his vexations at the Court, his differences with\r\nM. de Blacas, his impotence to do what he thought good, or to prevent\r\nwhat he considered evil. He went far beyond this freedom of\r\nconversation, by consigning to me, in his department, many matters\r\nbeyond the duties of my specific office, and would have allowed me to\r\nassume a considerable portion of his power.[4] Thus I became associated,\r\nduring his administration, with three important circumstances, the only\r\nones I shall dwell on, for I am not writing the history of the time; I\r\nmerely relate what I did, saw, and thought myself, in the general course\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nThe Charter being promulgated, and the Government settled, I suggested\r\nto the Abbe de Montesquiou that it would be well for the King to place\r\nbefore the Chambers a summary of the internal condition of France, as he\r\nhad found it, showing the results of the preceding system, and\r\nexplaining the spirit of that which he proposed to establish. The\r\nMinister was pleased with the idea, the King adopted it, and I\r\nimmediately applied myself to the work. The Abbe de Montesquiou also\r\nassisted; for he wrote well, and took personal pleasure in the task. On\r\nthe 12th of July, the statement was presented to the two Chambers, who\r\nthanked the King by separate addresses. It contained, without\r\nexaggeration or concealment, a true picture of the miseries which\r\nunlimited and incessant war had inflicted on France, and the moral and\r\nphysical wounds which it had left to be healed,--a strange portrait,\r\nwhen considered with reference to those which Napoleon, under the\r\nConsulate and the dawning Empire, had also given to the world; and which\r\neulogized, with good reason at the time, the restoration of order, the\r\nestablishment of rule, the revival of prosperity, with all the excellent\r\neffects of strong, able, and rational power. The descriptions were\r\nequally true, although immeasurably different; and precisely in this\r\ncontrast lay the startling moral with which the history of the Imperial\r\ndespotism had just concluded. The Abbe de Montesquiou ought to have\r\nplaced the glorious edifices of the Consulate side by side with the\r\ndeserved ruins of the Empire. Instead of losing by this course, he would\r\nhave added to the impression he intended to produce; but men are seldom\r\ndisposed to praise their enemies, even though the effect should be to\r\ninjure them. By alluding only to the disasters of Napoleon, and their\r\nfatal consequences, the exposition of the state of the kingdom in 1814\r\nwas undignified, and appeared to be unjust. The points in which it\r\nreflected honour on the authority from whence it emanated, were the\r\nmoral tone, the liberal spirit, and the absence of all quackery, which\r\nwere its leading features. These recommendations had their weight with\r\nright-minded, sensible people; but they passed for little with a public\r\naccustomed to the dazzling noise and bustle of the power which had\r\nrecently been extinguished.\r\n\r\nAnother exposition, more special, but of greater urgency, was presented\r\na few days after, by the Minister of Finance, to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. This included the amount of debt bequeathed by the Empire to\r\nthe Restoration, with the Ministerial plan for meeting the arrear, as\r\nwell as providing for the exigencies of 1814 and 1815. Amongst all the\r\nGovernment officials of my time, I have never been acquainted with any\r\none more completely a public servant, or more passionately devoted to\r\nthe public interest, than the Baron Louis. Ever resolved to cast aside\r\nall other considerations, he cared neither for personal risk nor labour,\r\nin promoting the success of what that interest demanded. It was not only\r\nthe carrying out of his financial measures that he so ardently desired;\r\nhe made these subservient to the general policy of which they were a\r\nportion. In 1830, in the midst of the disturbances occasioned by the\r\nRevolution of July, I one day, as Minister of the Interior, demanded\r\nfrom the Council, in which the Baron Louis also had a seat as Minister\r\nof Finance, the allocation of a large sum. Objections were made by\r\nseveral of our colleagues, on account of the embarrassed state of the\r\ntreasury. \"Govern well,\" said the Baron Louis to me, \"and you will never\r\nspend as much money as I shall be able to supply.\" A judicious speech,\r\nworthy of a frank, uncompromising disposition, controlled by a firm and\r\nconsistent judgment. The Baron Louis's financial scheme was founded on a\r\ndouble basis,--constitutional order in the State, and probity in the\r\nGovernment. With these two conditions, he reckoned confidently on public\r\nprosperity and credit, without being dismayed by debts to be paid, or\r\nexpenses incurred. His assertions as to the closing state of the\r\nfinances under the Empire, drew from the Count Mollien, the last\r\nMinister of the Imperial treasury, a man as able as he was honest, some\r\nwell-founded remonstrances, and his measures were in consequence\r\nseverely opposed in the Chambers. He had to contend with dishonest\r\ntraditions, the passions of the old system, and the narrow views of\r\nlittle minds. The Baron Louis maintained the struggle with equal\r\nenthusiasm and perseverance. It was fortunate for him that\r\nM. de Talleyrand and the Abbe de Montesquiou had been his associates in\r\nthe Church in early youth, and had always maintained a close intimacy\r\nwith him. Both having enlightened views on political economy, they\r\nsupported him strongly in the Council and in the Chambers. The\r\nPrince de Talleyrand even undertook to present his bill to the Chamber\r\nof Peers, adopting boldly the responsibility and the principles. This\r\nsound policy was well carried through by the whole cabinet, and justly\r\nmet with complete success, in spite of prejudiced or ignorant\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nIt was not exactly the same with another measure in which I took a more\r\nactive part,--the bill relating to the press, presented to the Chamber\r\nof Deputies on the 5th of July by the Abbe de Montesquiou, and which\r\npassed into law on the 21st of the following October, after having\r\nundergone, in both assemblies, animated debates and important\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nIn its first conception, this bill was reasonable and sincere. The\r\nobject was to consecrate by legislative enactment the liberty of the\r\npress, both as a public right and as a general and permanent institution\r\nof the country; and at the same time, on the morrow of a great\r\nrevolution and a long despotism, and on the advent of a free government,\r\nto impose some temporary and limited restrictions. The two persons who\r\nhad taken the most active part in framing this bill, M. Royer-Collard\r\nand myself, were actuated simply and solely by this double end. I may\r\nrefer the reader to a short work which I published at the time,[5] a\r\nlittle before the introduction of the bill, and in which its spirit and\r\nintention are stated without reserve.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident that the King and the two Chambers had the right of\r\nprescribing in concert, temporarily, and from the pressure of\r\ncircumstances, certain limitations to one of the privileges recognized\r\nby the Charter. This cannot be denied without repudiating constitutional\r\ngovernment itself, and its habitual practice in those countries in which\r\nit is developed with the greatest vigour. Provisional enactments have\r\nfrequently modified or suspended, in England, the leading constitutional\r\nprivileges; and with regard to the liberty of the press in particular,\r\nit was not until five years after the Revolution of 1688 that, under the\r\nreign of William III. in 1693, it was relieved from the censorship.\r\n\r\nI recognize no greater danger to free institutions than that blind\r\ntyranny which the habitual fanaticism of partisanship, whether of a\r\nfaction or a small segment, pretends to exercise in the name of liberal\r\nideas. Are you a staunch advocate for constitutional government and\r\npolitical guarantees? Do you wish to live and act in co-operation with\r\nthe party which hoists this standard? Renounce at once your judgment and\r\nyour independence. In that party you will find upon all questions and\r\nunder all circumstances, opinions ready formed, and resolutions settled\r\nbeforehand, which assume the right of your entire control. Self-evident\r\nfacts are in open contradiction to these opinions--you are forbidden to\r\nsee them. Powerful obstacles oppose these resolutions--you are\r\nnot allowed to think of them. Equity and prudence suggest\r\ncircumspection--you must cast it aside. You are in presence of a\r\nsuperstitious _Credo_, and a popular passion. Do not argue--you would no\r\nlonger be a Liberal. Do not oppose--you would be looked upon as a\r\nmutineer. Obey, advance--no matter at what pace you are urged, or on\r\nwhat road. If you cease to be a slave, you instantly become a deserter!\r\n\r\nMy clear judgment and a little natural pride revolted invincibly against\r\nthis yoke. I never imagined that even the best system of institutions\r\ncould be at once imposed on a country without some remembrance of recent\r\nevents and actual facts, both as regarded the dispositions of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the country itself and of its necessary rulers.\r\nI saw not only the King, his family, and a great number of the old\r\nRoyalists, but even in new France, a crowd of well-meaning citizens and\r\nenlightened minds--perhaps a majority of the middle and substantial\r\nclasses--extremely uneasy at the idea of the unrestricted liberty of the\r\npress, and at the dangers to which it might expose public peace, as well\r\nas moral and political order. Without participating to the same extent\r\nin their apprehensions, I was myself struck by the excesses in which the\r\npress had already begun to indulge; by the deluge of recriminations,\r\naccusations, surmises, predictions, animated invectives, or frivolous\r\nsarcasms, which threatened to rouse into hostility all parties, with all\r\ntheir respective errors, falsehoods, fears, and antipathies. With these\r\nfeelings and facts before me, I should have considered myself a madman\r\nto have treated them lightly, and therefore I decided at once that a\r\ntemporary limitation of liberty, in respect to journals and pamphlets\r\nalone, was not too great a sacrifice for the removal of such perils and\r\nfears, or at least to give the country time to overcome by becoming\r\naccustomed to them.\r\n\r\nBut to ensure the success of a sound measure, open honesty is\r\nindispensable. Whether in the proposition or the debate, Government\r\nitself was called upon to proclaim the general right, as well as the\r\nlimits and reasons for the partial restriction which it was about to\r\nintroduce. It ought not to have evaded the principle of the liberty or\r\nthe character of the restraining law. This course was not adopted.\r\nNeither the King nor his advisers had formed any fixed design against\r\nthe freedom of the press; but they were more disposed to control it in\r\nfact than to acknowledge it in right, and wished rather that the new\r\nlaw, instead of giving additional sanction to the principle recorded in\r\nthe Charter, should leave it in rather a vague state of doubt and\r\nhesitation. When the bill was introduced, its true intent and bearing\r\nwere not clearly indicated. Weak himself, and yielding still more to the\r\nweaknesses of others, the Abbe de Montesquiou endeavoured to give the\r\ndebate a moral and literary, rather than a political turn. According to\r\nhis view, the question before them was the protection of literature and\r\nscience, of good taste and manners, and not the exercise and guarantee\r\nof an acknowledged public right. An amendment in the Chamber of Peers\r\nwas necessary to invest the measure with the political and temporary\r\ncharacter which it ought to have borne from the beginning, and which\r\nalone confined it to its real objects and within its legitimate limits.\r\nThe Government accepted the amendment without hesitation, but its\r\nposition had become embarrassed. Mistrust, the most credulous of all\r\npassions, spread rapidly amongst the Liberals. Those who were not\r\nenemies to the Restoration had, like it, their foibles. The love of\r\npopularity had seized them, but they had not yet acquired foresight.\r\nThey gladly embraced this opportunity of making themselves, with some\r\ndisplay, the champions of a Constitutional principle which in fact was\r\nin no danger, but which power had assumed the air of eluding or\r\ndisavowing. Three of the five honourable members who had been the first\r\nto restrain the Imperial despotism--Messrs. Raynouard, Gallois, and\r\nFlaugergues--were the declared adversaries of the bill; and in\r\nconsequence of not having been boldly presented, from the opening, under\r\nits real and legitimate aspect, the measure entailed more discredit on\r\nthe Government than it afforded them security.\r\n\r\nThe liberty of the press, that stormy guarantee of modern civilization,\r\nhas already been, is, and will continue to be the roughest trial of free\r\ngovernments, and consequently of free people, who are greatly\r\ncompromised in the struggles of their rulers; for in the event of\r\ndefeat, they have no alternative but anarchy or tyranny. Free nations\r\nand governments have but one honourable and effective method of dealing\r\nwith the liberty of the press,--to adopt it frankly, without undue\r\ncomplaisance. Let them not make it a martyr or an idol, but leave it in\r\nits proper place, without elevating it beyond its natural rank. The\r\nliberty of the press is neither a power in the State, nor the\r\nrepresentative of the public mind, nor the supreme judge of the\r\nexecutive authorities; it is simply the right of all citizens to give\r\ntheir opinions upon public affairs and the conduct of Government,--a\r\npowerful and respectable privilege, but one naturally overbearing, and\r\nwhich, to be made salutary, requires that the constituted authorities\r\nshould never humiliate themselves before it, and that they should impose\r\non it that serious and constant responsibility which ought to weigh upon\r\nall rights, to prevent them from becoming at first seditious, and\r\nafterwards tyrannical.\r\n\r\nThe third measure of importance in which I was concerned at this epoch,\r\nthe reform of the general system of public instruction, by a Royal\r\nordinance of the 17th of February, 1815, created much less sensation\r\nthan the Law of the Press, and produced even less effect than noise; for\r\nits execution was entirely suspended by the catastrophe of the 20th of\r\nMarch, and not resumed after the Hundred Days. There were more important\r\nmatters then under consideration. This measure was what is now called\r\nthe de-centralization of the University.[6] Seventeen separate\r\nUniversities, established in the principal cities of the kingdom, were\r\nto be substituted for the one general University of the Empire. Each of\r\nthese local colleges was to have a complete and separate organization,\r\nboth as regarded the different degrees of instruction and the various\r\nscholastic establishments within its jurisdiction. Over the seventeen\r\nUniversities a Royal Council and a great Normal School were appointed,\r\none to superintend the general course of public teaching, and the other\r\nto train up for professors the chosen scholars who had prepared\r\nthemselves for that career, and who were to be supplied from the local\r\nUniversities. There were two motives for this reform. The first was a\r\ndesire to establish, in the departments, and quite independent of Paris,\r\nleading centres of learning and intellectual activity; the second, a\r\nwish to abolish the absolute power which, in the Imperial University,\r\nheld sole control over the establishments and the masters, and to bring\r\nthe former under a closer and more immediate authority, by giving the\r\nlatter more permanence, dignity, and independence in their respective\r\npositions. These were sound ideas, to carry out which the decree of the\r\n17th of February, 1815, was but a timid rather than an extended and\r\npowerful application. The local Universities were too numerous. France\r\ndoes not supply seventeen natural centres of high learning. Four or five\r\nwould have sufficed, and more could not have been rendered successful or\r\nproductive. The forgotten reform which I am here recalling had yet\r\nanother fault. It was introduced too soon, and was the result, at once\r\nsystematic and incomplete, of the meditations of certain men long\r\nimpressed with the deficiencies of the University system, and not really\r\nthe fruit of public impulse and opinion. Another influence also appeared\r\nin it, that of the clergy, who silently commenced at that time their\r\nstruggle with the University, and adroitly looked for the extension of\r\ntheir personal power in the progress of general liberty. The decree of\r\nthe 17th of February, 1815, opened this arena, which has since been so\r\nfiercely agitated. The Abbe de Montesquiou hastened to bestow on the\r\nclergy an early gratification, that of seeing one of their most justly\r\nesteemed members, M. de Beausset, formerly Bishop of Alais, at the head\r\nof the Royal Council. The Liberals of the University gladly seized this\r\noccasion of increasing their action and independence; and the King,\r\nLouis XVIII., voluntarily charged his civil list with an additional\r\nmillion for the immediate abolition of the University tax, until a new\r\nlaw, contained in the preamble of the decree, should come into operation\r\nto complete the reform, and provide from the public funds for all the\r\nrequirements of the new system.\r\n\r\nIt becomes my duty here to express my regret for an error which I ought\r\nto have endeavoured more urgently to prevent. In this reform, the\r\nopinion and situation of M. de Fontanes were not sufficiently estimated.\r\nAs head of the Imperial University, he had rendered such eminent\r\nservices to public instruction, that the title of Grand Officer of the\r\nLegion of Honour was far from being a sufficient compensation for the\r\nretirement which the new system rendered, in his case, desirable and\r\nalmost necessary.\r\n\r\nBut neither reform in public education, nor any other reform, excited\r\nmuch interest at that moment, when France was entirely given up to\r\ndifferent considerations. Having scarcely entered on the new system, a\r\nsudden impression of alarm and mistrust began to rise and expand from\r\nday to day. This system was liberty, with its uncertainties, its\r\ncontests, and its perils. No one was accustomed to liberty, and liberty\r\ncontented no one. From the Restoration, the men of old France promised\r\nthemselves the ascendency; from the Charter, new France expected\r\nsecurity. Both were dissatisfied. They found themselves drawn up in\r\npresence of each other, with their opposing passions and pretensions. It\r\nwas a sad disappointment for the Royalists to find the King victorious\r\nwithout their being included in the triumph; and it was a bitter\r\nnecessity which reduced the men of the Revolution to the defensive after\r\nthey had so long domineered. Both parties felt surprised and irritated\r\nat their position, as equally an insult to their dignity and an attack\r\nupon their rights. In their irritation, they gave themselves up, in\r\nwords and projects, to all the fantasies and transports of their wishes\r\nand apprehensions. Amongst the rich and powerful of the old classes,\r\nmany indulged, towards the influential members of the new, in menaces\r\nand insults. At the Court, in the drawing-rooms of Paris, and much more\r\nin the provinces, by newspapers, pamphlets, and conversation, and in the\r\ndaily conduct of their private lives, the nobles and the citizens, the\r\nclergy and the laity, the emigrants and the purchasers of national\r\nproperty, allowed their animosities, their ill humour, their dreams of\r\nhope and fear, to exhibit themselves without disguise. This was nothing\r\nmore than the natural and inevitable consequence of the extreme novelty\r\nof the system which the Charter, seriously interpreted and exercised,\r\nhad suddenly introduced into France. During the Revolution there was\r\ncontest; under the Empire silence; but the Restoration introduced\r\nliberty into the bosom of peace. In the general inexperience and\r\nsusceptibility, the excitement and stir of freedom amounted to civil war\r\non the eve of re-commencement.\r\n\r\nTo meet the difficulties of such a state of things, to preserve at the\r\nsame time liberty and peace, to cure the wounds without restraining the\r\nblows, no Government could have been too strong or too able. Louis\r\nXVIII. and his advisers were unequal to the task. With regard to a\r\nliberal system, they were neither more experienced nor inured than\r\nFrance herself. Their acts appeared to be regulated by no steady\r\nconviction: they believed that the Charter would check the birth of\r\ndiscontent; but when discontent manifested itself rather vehemently,\r\nthey hastened to calm it down by abandoning or modifying the measures\r\nthrough which it had been excited. The celebrated rescript of Count\r\nBeugnot,[7] on the observance of Sundays and religious festivals, ended\r\nin an abortive law which never came into operation. The offensive\r\nexpressions of Count Ferrand, on introducing to the Chamber of Deputies\r\nthe bill for the restitution of unsold estates to their old\r\nproprietors,[8] was loudly disavowed, not only in the speeches, but in\r\nthe resolutions and conduct of the Government in that matter. In\r\nreality, the interests which imagined themselves threatened were in no\r\ndanger whatever; and in the midst of the alarms and remonstrances of\r\nFrance, the King and his principal ministers were much more inclined to\r\nyield than to contend. But having performed this act of constitutional\r\nwisdom, they believed themselves emancipated from all care, and relapsed\r\nback into their old tastes and habits, desirous also to live in peace\r\nwith their ancient and familiar friends. It was indeed but a modified\r\npower, which attached importance to its oaths, and conceived no\r\nformidable designs against the new rights and interests of the country;\r\nbut it was also an authority without leading vigour, isolated and a\r\nstranger in its own kingdom, divided and embarrassed within itself, weak\r\nwith its enemies, weak with its friends, seeking only for personal\r\nsecurity in repose, and called upon hourly to deal with a stubborn and\r\nrestless people, who had suddenly passed from the rugged shocks of\r\nrevolution and war to the difficult exercise of liberty.\r\n\r\nUnder the prolonged influence of this liberty, such a Government,\r\nwithout obstinate prejudices, and disposed to follow public opinion when\r\nclearly expressed, might have corrected while strengthening itself, and\r\nfrom day to day have become more competent to its task. But this\r\nrequired time and the concurrence of the country. The country,\r\ndiscontented and unsettled, neither knew how to wait nor assist. Of all\r\nthe knowledge necessary to a free people, the most essential point is to\r\nlearn how to bear what displeases them, that they may preserve the\r\nadvantages they possess, and acquire those they desire.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to what plots and conspirators\r\noverthrew the Bourbons, and brought back Napoleon, on the 20th of March,\r\n1815,--a question of inferior importance, and interesting only as an\r\nhistorical curiosity. It is certain that from 1814 to 1815 there\r\nexisted in the army and with the remnants of the Revolution, amongst\r\ngenerals and conventionalists, many plans and secret practices against\r\nthe Restoration, and in favour of a new Government,--either the Empire,\r\na regency, the Duke of Orleans, or a republic. Marshal Davoust promised\r\nhis support to the Imperial party, and Fouche offered his to all. But if\r\nNapoleon had remained motionless at the island of Elba, these\r\nrevolutionary projects would, in all probability, have successively\r\nfailed, as did those of the Generals d'Erlon, Lallemand, and Lefevre\r\nDesnouettes, even so late as the month of March. The fatuity of the\r\ncontrivers of conspiracy is incalculable; and when the event seems to\r\njustify them, they attribute to themselves the result which has been\r\nachieved by mightier and much more complicated causes than their\r\nmachinations. It was Napoleon alone who dethroned the Bourbons in 1815,\r\nby calling up, in his own person, the fanatical devotion of the army,\r\nand the revolutionary instincts of the popular masses.\r\n\r\nHowever tottering might be the monarchy lately restored, it required\r\nthat great man and a combination of these great social powers to subvert\r\nit. Stupefied and intimidated, France left events to their course,\r\nwithout opposition or confidence. Napoleon adopted this opinion, with\r\nhis admirable penetration:--\"They allowed me to arrive,\" he said to\r\nCount Mollien, \"as they permitted the others to depart.\"\r\n\r\nFour times in less than half a century we have seen kings traverse their\r\nrealms as fugitives. Different enemies have described, with evident\r\npleasure, their helplessness and destitution in flight,--a mean and\r\nsenseless gratification, which no one, in the present day, has a right\r\nto indulge. The retreats of Napoleon in 1814 and 1815 were neither more\r\nbrilliant nor less bitter than those of Louis XVIII. on the 20th of\r\nMarch, 1815, of Charles X. in 1830, and of Louis Philippe in 1848. Each\r\nstate of greatness endured the same degradation; every party has the\r\nsame need of modesty and mutual respect. I myself, as much as any\r\nparticipator, was impressed, on the 20th of March, 1815, with the\r\nblindness, the hesitation, the imbecility, the misery of every\r\ndescription, to which that terrible explosion gave birth. It would\r\nafford me no pleasure, and would lead to no advantage, to repeat them.\r\nPeople are too much inclined at present to conceal their own weaknesses\r\nunder a display of the deficiencies of royalty. I prefer recording that\r\nneither royal nor national dignity were wanting at that epoch in noble\r\nrepresentatives. The Duchess d'Angouleme, at Bordeaux, evinced courage\r\nequal to her misfortunes, and M. Laine, as president of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, protested fearlessly on the 28th of March, in the name of\r\njustice and liberty, against the event at that time fully accomplished,\r\nand which no longer encountered, through the wide extent of France, any\r\nresistance beyond the solitary accents of his voice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Included in the \"Historic Documents,\" are two letters\r\naddressed to me by the Abbe de Montesquiou in 1815 and 1816, which\r\nfurnish an idea of my intimacy with him, and show the natural and\r\namiable turn of his mind.

Not but that the miraculous success of Napoleon had convinced\r\nme there was a power within him which, after witnessing his fall, I was\r\nfar from believing. Never was personal greatness displayed with more\r\nastounding splendour; never had an act more audacious, or better\r\ncalculated in its audacity, arrested the imagination of nations. Neither\r\nwas external support wanting to the man who relied so much on himself,\r\nand on himself alone.\r\n\r\nThe army identified itself with him, with an enthusiastic and blind\r\ndevotion. Amongst the popular masses, a revolutionary and warlike\r\nspirit, hatred of the old system and national pride, rose up at his\r\nappearance and rushed madly to his aid. Accompanied by fervent\r\nworshippers, he re-ascended a throne abandoned to him on his approach.\r\nBut by the side of this overwhelming power, there appeared almost\r\nsimultaneously a proportionate weakness. He who had traversed France in\r\ntriumph, and who by personal influence had swept all with him, friends\r\nand enemies, re-entered Paris at night, exactly as Louis XVIII. had\r\nquitted that capital, his carriage surrounded by dragoons, and only\r\nencountering on his passage a scanty and moody populace. Enthusiasm had\r\naccompanied him throughout his journey; but at its termination he found\r\ncoldness, doubt, widely disseminated mistrust, and cautious reserve;\r\nFrance divided, and Europe irrevocably hostile.\r\n\r\nThe upper, and particularly the middle classes, have often been\r\nreproached with their indifference and selfishness. It has been said\r\nthat they think only of their personal interests, and are incapable of\r\npublic principle and patriotism. I am amongst those who believe that\r\nnations, and the different classes that constitute nations--and, above\r\nall, nations that desire to be free--can only live in security and\r\ncredit under a condition of moral perseverance and energy; with feelings\r\nof devotion to their cause, and with the power of opposing courage and\r\nself-sacrifice to danger. But devotion does not exclude sound sense, nor\r\ncourage intelligence. It would be too convenient for ambitious\r\npretenders, to have blind and fearless attachment ever ready at their\r\ncommand. It is often the case with popular feeling, that the multitude,\r\narmy or people, ignorant, unreflecting, and short-sighted, become too\r\nfrequently, from generous impulse, the instruments and dupes of\r\nindividual selfishness, much more perverse and more indifferent to their\r\nfate than that of which the wealthy and enlightened orders are so\r\nreadily accused. Napoleon, perhaps more than any other eminent leader of\r\nhis class, has exacted from military and civil devotion the most trying\r\nproofs; and when, on the 21st of June, 1815, his brother Lucien, in the\r\nChamber of Representatives, reproached France with not having upheld him\r\nwith sufficient ardour and constancy, M. de la Fayette exclaimed, with\r\njustice: \"By what right is the nation accused of want of devotion and\r\nenergy towards the Emperor Napoleon? It has followed him to the burning\r\nsands of Egypt, and the icy deserts of Moscow; in fifty battle-fields,\r\nin disaster as well as in triumph, in the course of ten years, three\r\nmillions of Frenchmen have perished in his service. We have done enough\r\nfor him!\"\r\n\r\nGreat and small, nobility, citizens, and peasants, rich and poor,\r\nlearned and ignorant, generals and private soldiers, the French people\r\nin a mass had, at least, done and suffered enough in Napoleon's cause to\r\ngive them the right of refusing to follow him blindly, without first\r\nexamining whether he was leading them, to safety or to ruin.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled feeling of the middle classes in 1815 was a legitimate and\r\npatriotic disquietude. What they wanted, and what they had a right to\r\ndemand, for the advantage of the entire nation as well as for their own\r\npeculiar interests, was that peace and liberty should be secured to\r\nthem; but they had good reason to question the power of Napoleon to\r\naccomplish these objects.\r\n\r\nTheir doubts materially increased when they ascertained the Manifesto of\r\nthe Allied Powers assembled at the Congress of Vienna, their declaration\r\nof March 13th, and their treaty of the 25th. Every reflecting mind of\r\nthe present day must see, that unless the nation had obstinately closed\r\nits eyes, it could not delude itself as to the actual situation of the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, and his prospects for the future. Not only did the\r\nAllied Powers, in proclaiming him the enemy and disturber of the peace\r\nof the whole world, declare war against him to the last extremity, and\r\nengage themselves to unite their strength in this common cause, but they\r\nprofessed themselves ready to afford to the King of France and the\r\nFrench nation the assistance necessary to re-establish public\r\ntranquillity; and they expressly invited Louis XVIII. to give his\r\nadhesion to their treaty of March 25th. They laid it down also as a\r\nprinciple, that the work of general pacification and reconstruction\r\naccomplished in Paris by the treaty of the 30th of May, 1814, between\r\nthe King of France and confederated Europe, was in no degree nullified\r\nby the violent outbreak which had recently burst forth; and that they\r\nshould maintain it against Napoleon, whose return and sudden\r\nsuccess--the fruit of military and revolutionary excitement--could\r\nestablish no European right whatever, and could never be considered by\r\nthem as the prevailing and true desire of France:--a solemn instance of\r\nthe implacable judgments that, assisted by God and time, great errors\r\ndraw down upon their authors!\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Napoleon might dispute the opinion of the Allied Powers\r\nas to the wishes of France; they might believe that, for the honour of\r\nher independence, she owed him her support; but they could not pretend\r\nthat foreign nations should not also have their independence at heart,\r\nnor persuade them that, with Napoleon master of France, they could ever\r\nbe secure. No promises, no treaties, no embarrassments, no reverses,\r\ncould give them confidence in his future moderation. His character and\r\nhis history deprived his word of all credit.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone governments, kings, and ministers who showed themselves\r\nthus firmly determined to oppose Napoleon's return; foreign nations were\r\neven more distrustful and more violent against him. He had not alone\r\noverwhelmed them with wars, taxes, invasions, and dismemberments; he had\r\ninsulted as much as he had oppressed them. The Germans, especially, bore\r\nhim undying hatred. They burned to revenge the injuries of the Queen of\r\nPrussia, and the contempt with which their entire race had been treated.\r\nThe bitter taunts in which he had often indulged when speaking of them\r\nwere repeated in every quarter, spread abroad and commented on, probably\r\nwith exaggeration readily credited. After the campaign in Russia, the\r\nEmperor was conversing, one day, on the loss sustained by the French\r\narmy during that terrible struggle. The Duke of Vicenza estimated it at\r\n200,000 men. \"No, no,\" interrupted Napoleon, \"you are mistaken; it was\r\nnot so much.\" But, after considering a moment, he continued, \"And yet\r\nyou can scarcely be wrong; but there were a great many Germans amongst\r\nthem.\" The Duke of Vicenza himself related this contemptuous remark to\r\nme; and the Emperor Napoleon must have been pleased both with the\r\ncalculation and reply, for on the 28th of June, 1813, at Dresden, in a\r\nconversation which has since become celebrated, he held the same\r\nlanguage to the Prime Minister of the first of the German Powers, to\r\nM. de Metternich himself. Who can estimate the extent of indignation\r\nroused by such words and actions, in the souls not only of the heads of\r\nthe government and army--- amongst the Steins, Gneisenaus, Bluechers, and\r\nMuefflings--but in those of the entire nation? The universal feeling of\r\nthe people of Germany was as fully displayed at the Congress of Vienna\r\nas the foresight of their diplomatists and the will of their sovereigns.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in quitting Elba, deceived himself as to the disposition of\r\nEurope towards him. Did he entertain the hope of treating with and\r\ndividing the Coalition? This has been often asserted, and it may be\r\ntrue; for the strongest minds seldom recognize all the difficulties of\r\ntheir situation. But, once arrived at Paris, and informed of the\r\nproceedings of the Congress, he beheld his position in its true light,\r\nand his clear and comprehensive judgment at once grappled with it in all\r\nits bearings. His conversations with the thinking men who were then\r\nabout him, M. Mole and the Duke of Vicenza, confirm this opinion. He\r\nsought still to keep the public in the uncertainty that he himself no\r\nlonger felt. The Manifesto of the Congress of the 13th of March was not\r\npublished in the 'Moniteur' until the 5th of April, and the treaty of\r\nthe 25th of March only on the 3rd of May. Napoleon added long\r\ncommentaries to these documents, to prove that it was impossible they\r\ncould express the final intentions of Europe. At Vienna, both by\r\nsolemnly official letters and secret emissaries, he made several\r\nattempts to renew former relations with the Emperor Francis, his\r\nfather-in-law, to obtain the return of his wife and son, to promote\r\ndisunion, or at least mistrust, between the Emperor Alexander and the\r\nsovereigns of England and Austria, and to bring back to his side Prince\r\nMetternich, and even M. de Talleyrand himself. He probably did not\r\nexpect much from these advances, and felt little surprise at not\r\nfinding, in family ties and feelings, a support against political\r\ninterests and pledges. He understood and accepted without a sentiment of\r\nanger against any one, and perhaps without self-reproach, the situation\r\nto which the events of his past life had reduced him. It was that of a\r\ndesperate gamester, who, though completely ruined, still plays on,\r\nalone, against a host of combined adversaries, a desperate game, with no\r\nother chance of success than one of those unforeseen strokes that the\r\nmost consummate talent could never achieve, but that Fortune sometimes\r\nbestows upon her favourites.\r\n\r\nIt has been, pretended, even by some of his warmest admirers, that at\r\nthis period the genius and energy of Napoleon had declined; and they\r\nsought in his tendency to corpulence, in his attacks of languor, in his\r\nlong slumbers, the explanation of his ill fortune. I believe the\r\nreproach to be unfounded, and the pretext frivolous. I can discover in\r\nthe mind or actions of Napoleon during the hundred days, no symptoms of\r\ninfirmity; I find, in both, his accustomed superiority. The causes of\r\nhis ultimate failure were of a deeper cast: he was not then, as he had\r\nlong been, upheld and backed by general opinion, and the necessity of\r\nsecurity and order felt throughout a great nation; he attempted, on the\r\ncontrary, a mischievous work, a work inspired only by his own passions\r\nand personal wants, rejected by the morality and good sense, as well as\r\nby the true interests of France. He engaged in this utterly egotistical\r\nenterprise with contradictory means, and in an impossible position. From\r\nthence came the reverses he suffered, and the evil he produced.\r\n\r\nIt presented a strange spectacle to intelligent spectators, and one\r\nslightly tinged with the ridiculous, on both sides, to see Napoleon and\r\nthe heads of the Liberal party arranged against each other, not to\r\nquarrel openly, but mutually to persuade, seduce, and control. A\r\nsuperficial glance sufficed to convince that there was little sincerity\r\neither in their dispute or reconciliation. Both well knew that the real\r\nstruggle lay in other quarters, and that the question upon which their\r\nfate depended would be settled elsewhere than in these discussions.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon had triumphed over Europe, assuredly he would not long have\r\nremained the rival of M. de La Fayette and the disciple of Benjamin\r\nConstant; but when he lost the day of Waterloo, M. de La Fayette and his\r\nfriends set themselves to work to complete his overthrow.\r\n\r\nFrom necessity and calculation, the true thoughts and passions of men\r\nare sometimes buried in the recesses of their hearts; but they quickly\r\nmount to the surface as soon as an opportunity occurs for their\r\nreappearing with success. Frequently did Napoleon resign himself, with\r\ninfinite pliability, shrewdness, and perception, to the farce that he\r\nand the Liberals were playing together; at one moment gently, though\r\nobstinately, defending his old policy and real convictions; and at\r\nanother yielding them up with good grace, but without positive\r\nrenunciation, as if out of complaisance to opinions which he hesitated\r\nto acknowledge. But now and then, whether from premeditation or\r\nimpatience, he violently resumed his natural character; and the despot,\r\nwho was at once the child and conqueror of the Revolution, reappeared in\r\ncomplete individuality.\r\n\r\nWhen an attempt was made to induce him to insert, in the Additional Act\r\nto the Constitutions of the Empire, the abolition of the confiscation\r\nproclaimed by the Charter of Louis XVIII., he exclaimed passionately,\r\n\"They drive me into a path that is not my own; they enfeeble and enchain\r\nme. France will seek, and find me no longer. Her opinion of me was once\r\nexcellent; it is now execrable. France demands what has become of the\r\nold arm of the Emperor, the arm which she requires to control Europe.\r\nWhy talk to me of innate virtue, of abstract justice, of natural laws?\r\nThe first law is necessity; the first principle of justice is public\r\nsafety ... Every day has its evil, every circumstance its law, every man\r\nhis own nature; mine is not that of an angel. When peace is made, we\r\nshall see.\" On another occasion, on this same question of preparing the\r\nAdditional Act, and with reference to the institution of an hereditary\r\npeerage, he yielded to the excursive rapidity of his mind, taking the\r\nsubject by turns under different aspects, and giving unlimited vent to\r\ncontradictory observations and opinions. \"Hereditary peerage,\" said he,\r\n\"is opposed to the present state of public opinion; it will wound the\r\npride of the army, deceive the expectations of the partisans of\r\nequality, and raise against myself a thousand individual claims. Where\r\ndo you wish me to look for the elements of that aristocracy which the\r\npeerage demands?... Nevertheless a constitution without an aristocracy\r\nresembles a balloon lost in the air. A ship is guided because there are\r\ntwo powers which balance each other; the helm finds a fulcrum. But a\r\nballoon is the sport of a single power; it has no fulcrum. The wind\r\ncarries it where it will, and control is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the question of principle was decided, and the nomination of his\r\nhereditary house of peers came under consideration, Napoleon was anxious\r\nto include many names from amongst the old Royalists; but after mature\r\nreflection, he renounced this idea, \"not,\" says Benjamin Constant,\r\n\"without regret,\" and exclaimed, \"We must have them sooner or later; but\r\nmemories are too recent. Let us wait until after the battle--they will\r\nbe with me if I prove the strongest.\"\r\n\r\nHe would thus willingly have deferred all questions, and have done\r\nnothing until he came back a conqueror; but with the Restoration liberty\r\nonce more re-entered France, and he himself had again woke up the\r\nRevolution. He found himself in conflict with these two forces,\r\nconstrained to tolerate, and endeavouring to make use of them, until the\r\nmoment should arrive when he might conquer both.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner adopted all the pledges of liberty that the Additional\r\nAct borrowed from the Charter, than he found he had still to deal with\r\nanother ardent desire, another article of faith, of the Liberals, still\r\nmore repugnant to his nature. They demanded an entirely new\r\nconstitution, which should confer on him the Imperial crown by the will\r\nof the nation, and on the conditions which that will prescribed. This\r\nwas, in fact, an attempt to remodel, in the name of the sovereign\r\npeople, the entire form of government, institutional and dynastic; an\r\narrogant and chimerical mania which, a year before, had possessed the\r\nImperial Senate when they recalled Louis XVIII., and which has vitiated\r\nin their source nearly all the political theories of our time.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, while incessantly proclaiming the supremacy of the people,\r\nviewed it in a totally different light. \"You want to deprive me of my\r\npast,\" said he, to his physicians; \"I desire to preserve it. What\r\nbecomes then of my reign of eleven years? I think I have some right to\r\ncall it mine; and Europe knows that I have. The new constitution must be\r\njoined to the old one; it will thus acquire the sanction of many years\r\nof glory and success.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right: the abdication demanded of him was more humiliating than\r\nthat of Fontainebleau; for, in restoring the throne to him, they at the\r\nsame time compelled him to deny himself and his immortal history. By\r\nrefusing this, he performed an act of rational pride; and in the\r\npreamble as well as in the name of the Additional Act, he upheld the old\r\nEmpire, while he consented to modified reforms. When the day of\r\npromulgation arrived, on the 1st of June, at the Champ de Mai, his\r\nfidelity to the Imperial traditions was less impressive and less\r\ndignified. He chose to appear before the people with all the outward\r\npomp of royalty, surrounded by the princes of his family arrayed in\r\ngarments of white taffeta, by the great dignitaries, in orange-coloured\r\nmantles, by his chamberlains and pages:--a childish attachment to\r\npalatial splendour, which accorded ill with the state of public affairs,\r\nand deeply disgusted public feeling, when, in the midst of this\r\nglittering pageant, twenty thousand soldiers were seen to march past and\r\nsalute the Emperor, on their road to death.\r\n\r\nA few days before, a very different ceremony had revealed another\r\nembarrassing inconsistency in the revived Empire. While discussing with\r\nthe Liberal aristocracy his new constitution, Napoleon endeavoured to\r\nwin over and subdue, while he flattered, the revolutionary democrats.\r\nThe population of the Faubourgs St. Antoine and St. Marceau became\r\nexcited, and conceived the idea of forming themselves into a federation,\r\nas their fathers had done, and of demanding from the Emperor leaders and\r\narms. They obtained their desire; but they were no longer _Federates_,\r\nas in 1792; they were now called _Confederates_, in the hope that, by a\r\nsmall alteration of name, earlier reminiscences might be effaced. A\r\npolice regulation minutely settled the order of their progress through\r\nthe streets, provided against confusion, and arranged the ceremonial of\r\ntheir introduction to the Emperor, in the courtyard of the Tuileries.\r\nThey presented an address, which was long and heavy to extreme\r\ntediousness. He thanked them by the name of \"federated soldiers\"\r\n(_soldats federes_), carefully impressing upon them, himself, the\r\ncharacter in which it suited him to regard them. The next morning, the\r\n'Journal de l'Empire' contained the following paragraph:--\"The most\r\nperfect order was maintained, from the departure of the Confederates\r\nuntil their return; but in several places we heard with pain the\r\nEmperor's name mingled with songs which recall a too memorable epoch.\"\r\nThis was being rather severely scrupulous on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nSome days later, I happened to pass through the garden of the Tuileries.\r\nA hundred of these Federates, shabby enough in appearance, had assembled\r\nunder one of the balconies of the palace, shouting, \"_Long live the\r\nEmperor!_\" and trying to induce him to show himself. It was long before\r\nhe complied; but at length a window opened, the Emperor came forward,\r\nand waved his hand to them; but almost instantly the window was\r\nre-closed, and I distinctly saw Napoleon retire, shrugging his\r\nshoulders; vexed, no doubt, at being obliged to lend himself to\r\ndemonstrations so repugnant in their nature, and so unsatisfactory in\r\ntheir limited extent.\r\n\r\nHe was desirous of giving more than one pledge to the revolutionary\r\nparty. Before reviewing their battalions in the court of his palace, he\r\nhad taken into council the oldest and most celebrated of their leaders;\r\nbut I scarcely think he expected from them any warm co-operation.\r\nCarnot, an able officer, a sincere republican, and as honest a man as an\r\nidle fanatic can possibly be, could not fail to make a bad Minister of\r\nthe Interior; for he possessed neither of the two qualities essential to\r\nthis important post,--knowledge of men, and the power of inspiring and\r\ndirecting them otherwise than by general maxims and routine.\r\n\r\nNapoleon knew better than anybody else how Fouche regulated the\r\npolice,--for himself first, and for his own personal power; next for the\r\nauthority that employed him, and just as long as he found greater\r\nsecurity or advantage in serving than in betraying that authority. I\r\nonly met the Duke of Otranto twice, and had but two short conversations\r\nwith him. No man ever so thoroughly gave me the idea of fearless,\r\nironical, cynical indifference, of imperturbable self-possession\r\ncombined with an inordinate love of action and prominence, and of a\r\nfixed resolution to stop at nothing that might promote success, not from\r\nany settled design, but according to the plan or chance of the moment.\r\nHe had acquired from his long associations as a Jacobin proconsul, a\r\nkind of audacious independence; and remained a hardened pupil of the\r\nRevolution, while, at the same time, he became an unscrupulous implement\r\nof the Government and the Court. Napoleon assuredly placed no confidence\r\nin such a man, and knew well that, in selecting him as a minister, he\r\nwould have to watch more than he could employ him. But it was necessary\r\nthat the revolutionary flag should float clearly over the Empire under\r\nits proper name; and he therefore preferred to endure the presence of\r\nCarnot and Fouche in his cabinet, rather than to leave them without, to\r\nmurmur or conspire with certain sections of his enemies. At the moment\r\nof his return, and during the first weeks of the resuscitated Empire, he\r\nprobably reaped from this double selection the advantage that he\r\nanticipated; but when the dangers and difficulties of his situation\r\nmanifested themselves, when he came to action with the distrustful\r\nLiberals within, and with Europe without,--Carnot and Fouche became\r\nadditional dangers and difficulties in his path. Carnot, without\r\nabsolute treachery, served him clumsily and coldly; for in nearly all\r\nemergencies and questions he inclined much more to the Opposition than\r\nto the Emperor; but Fouche betrayed him indefinitely, whispering and\r\narguing in an under tone, of his approaching downfall, with all who\r\nmight by any possible chance happen to be his successors; just as an\r\nindifferent physician discourses by the bedside of a patient who has\r\nbeen given over.\r\n\r\nEven amongst his most trusted and most devoted adherents, Napoleon no\r\nlonger found, as formerly, implicit faith and obedient temperaments,\r\nready to act when and how he might please to direct. Independence of\r\nmind and a feeling of personal responsibility had resumed, even in his\r\nnearest circle, their scruples and their predominance. Fifteen days\r\nafter his arrival in Paris, he summoned his Grand Marshal, General\r\nBertrand, and presented to him, for his counter-signature, the decree\r\ndated from Lyons, in which he ordered the trials and sequestration of\r\nproperty of the Prince de Talleyrand, the Duke of Ragusa, the\r\nAbbe de Montesquiou, M. Bellard, and nine other persons, who in 1814,\r\nbefore the abdication, had contributed to his fall. General Bertrand\r\nrefused. \"I am astonished,\" said the Emperor, \"at your making such\r\nobjections; this severity is necessary for the good of the State.\" \"I do\r\nnot believe it, Sire.\" \"But I do, and I alone have the right to judge. I\r\nhave not asked your concurrence, but your signature, which is a mere\r\nmatter of form, and cannot compromise you in the least.\" \"Sire, a\r\nminister who countersigns the decree of his sovereign becomes morally\r\nresponsible. Your Majesty has declared by proclamation that you granted\r\na general amnesty. I countersigned that with all my heart; I will not\r\ncountersign the decree which revokes it.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon urged and cajoled in vain; Bertrand remained inflexible, the\r\ndecree appeared without his signature: and Napoleon might, even on the\r\ninstant, have convinced himself that the Grand Marshal was not the only\r\ndissentient; for, as he crossed the apartment in which his aides-de-camp\r\nwere assembled, M. de La Bedoyere said, loud enough to be overheard, \"If\r\nthe reign of proscriptions and sequestrations recommences, all will soon\r\nbe at an end.\"\r\n\r\nWhen liberty reaches this point in the interior of the palace, it may be\r\npresumed that it reigns predominantly without. After several weeks of\r\nstupor, it became, in fact, singularly bold and universal. Not only did\r\ncivil war spring up in the western departments, not only were flagrant\r\nacts of resistance or hostility committed in several parts of the\r\ncountry, and in important towns, by men of consequence,--but everywhere,\r\nand particularly in Paris, people thought, and uttered their thoughts\r\nwithout reserve; in public places as well as in private drawing-rooms,\r\nthey went to and fro, expressing hopes and engaging in hostile plots, as\r\nif they were lawful and certain of success; journals and pamphlets,\r\nincreased daily in number and virulence, and were circulated almost\r\nwithout opposition or restraint. The warm friends and attached servants\r\nof the Emperor testified their surprise and indignation.\r\n\r\nFouche pointed out the mischief, in his official reports to Napoleon,\r\nand requested his concurrence in taking measures of repression. The\r\n'Moniteur' published these reports; and the measures were decreed.\r\nSeveral arrests and prosecutions took place, but without vigour or\r\nefficacy. From high to low, the greater portion of the agents of\r\ngovernment had neither zeal in their cause, nor confidence in their\r\nstrength. Napoleon was aware of this, and submitted, as to a necessity\r\nof the moment, to the unlicensed freedom of his opponents, maintaining,\r\nwithout doubt, in his own heart, the opinion he had declared aloud on a\r\nprevious occasion,--\"I shall have them all with me if I prove the\r\nstrongest.\"\r\n\r\nI question whether he appreciated justly, and at its true value, one of\r\nthe causes, a hidden but powerful one, of the feebleness that\r\nimmediately succeeded his great success. Notwithstanding the\r\nwidely-spread discontent, uneasiness, mistrust, and anger that the\r\nGovernment of the Restoration had excited, a universal feeling soon\r\nsprang up, that there was not enough to justify a revolution, the\r\nopposition of an armed force against authority legally established, or\r\nthe involvement of the country in the dangers to which it was exposed.\r\nThe army had been drawn towards its old chief by a strong sentiment of\r\nattachment and generous devotion, rather than from views of personal\r\ninterest; the army, too, was national and popular; but nothing could\r\nchange the nature of acts or the meaning of words. The violation of an\r\noath, desertion with arms in their hands, the sudden passing over from\r\none camp to another, have always been condemned by honour as well as\r\nduty, civil or military, and denominated treason. Individuals, nations,\r\nor armies, men under the influence of a controlling passion, may\r\ncontemn, at the first moment, or perhaps do not feel the moral\r\nimpression which naturally attaches itself to their deeds; but it never\r\nfails to present itself, and, when seconded by the warnings of prudence\r\nor the blows of misfortune, it soon regains its empire.\r\n\r\nIt was the evil destiny of the Government of the Hundred Days that the\r\ninfluence of moral opinion ranged itself on the side of its adversaries\r\nthe Royalists; and that the conscience of the nation, clearly or\r\nobscurely, spontaneously or reluctantly, justified the severe judgments\r\nto which its origin had given rise.\r\n\r\nI and my friends attentively watched the progress of the Emperor's\r\naffairs and of the public temper. We soon satisfied ourselves that\r\nNapoleon would fall, and that Louis XVIII. would re-ascend the throne.\r\nWhile this was our impression of the future, we felt hourly more\r\nconvinced that, from the deplorable state into which the enterprise of\r\nthe Hundred Days had plunged France, abroad and at home, the return of\r\nLouis XVIII. would afford her the best prospect of restoring a regular\r\ngovernment within, peace without, and the reassumption of her proper\r\nrank in Europe. In public life, duty and reason equally dictate to us to\r\nencourage no self-delusion as to what produces evil; but to adopt the\r\nremedy firmly, however bitter it may be, and at whatever sacrifice it\r\nmay demand. I had taken no active part in the first Restoration; but I\r\nconcurred, without hesitation, in the attempts of my friends to\r\nestablish the second under the most favourable conditions for\r\npreserving the dignity, liberty, and repose of France.\r\n\r\nOur tidings from Ghent gave us much uneasiness. Acts and institutions,\r\nall the problems of principle or expediency which we flattered ourselves\r\nhad been solved in 1814, were again brought forward. The struggle had\r\nrecommenced between the Constitutional Royalists and the partisans of\r\nabsolute power, between the Charter and the old system. We often smile\r\nourselves, and seek to make others smile, when we revert to the\r\ndiscussions, rival pretensions, projects, hopes, and fears which\r\nagitated this small knot of exiles, gathered round an impotent and\r\nthroneless monarch. Such an indulgence is neither rational nor\r\ndignified. What matters it whether the theatre be great or small,\r\nwhether the actors fail or succeed, or whether the casualties of human\r\nlife are displayed with imposing grandeur or contemptible meanness? The\r\ntrue measurement lies in the subjects discussed and the future destinies\r\nprepared. The question in debate at Ghent was how France should be\r\ngoverned when this aged King, without state or army, should be called on\r\na second time to interpose between her and Europe. The problem and the\r\nsolution in perspective were sufficiently important to occupy the minds\r\nof reflecting men and honest citizens.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence from Vienna was no less momentous. Not that in reality\r\nthere was either doubt or hesitation in the plans or union of the Allied\r\nPowers. Fouche, who had for some time been in friendly correspondence\r\nwith Prince Metternich, made many overtures to him which the Chancellor\r\nof Austria did not absolutely reject. Every possible modification which\r\npromised a government to France was permitted to suggest itself. All\r\nwere discussed in the cabinets or drawing-rooms of the Ministers, and\r\neven in the conferences of the Congress. In these questions were\r\nincluded, Napoleon II. and a Regency, the Duke of Orleans, and the\r\nPrince of Orange. The English Ministry, speaking with the authority of\r\nParliament, announced that they had no intention of carrying on war\r\nmerely for the purpose of imposing any particular form of government or\r\ndynasty on France; and the Austrian Cabinet seconded this declaration.\r\nBut these were only personal reserves, or an apparent compliance with\r\ncircumstances, or methods of obtaining correct knowledge, or mere topics\r\nof conversation, or the anticipation of extreme cases to which the\r\nleaders of European politics never expected to be reduced. Diplomacy\r\nabounds in acts and propositions of little moment or value, which it\r\nneither denies nor acknowledges; but they exercise no real influence on\r\nthe true convictions, intents, and labours of the directors of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to proclaim it aloud, or to commit themselves by formal\r\nand public declarations, the leading kingdoms of Europe, from principle,\r\ninterest, or honour, looked upon their cause at this period as allied,\r\nin France, with that of the House of Bourbon. It was near Louis XVIII.\r\nin his exile, that their ambassadors continued to reside; and with all\r\nthe European Governments, the diplomatic agents of Louis XVIII.\r\nrepresented France. By the example and under the guidance of\r\nM. de Talleyrand, all these agents, in 1815, remained firm to the Royal\r\ncause, either from fidelity or foresight, and satisfied themselves, with\r\nhim, that in that cause lay final success.\r\n\r\nBut, side by side with this general disposition of Europe in favour of\r\nthe House of Bourbon, a balancing danger presented itself,--an\r\napprehension that the sovereigns and diplomatists assembled at Vienna\r\nhad become convinced that the Bourbons were incapable of governing\r\nFrance. They had all, for twenty years, treated with and known France\r\nsuch as the Revolution and the Empire had made her. They still feared\r\nher, and deeply pondered over her position. The more uneasy they became\r\nat her leaning towards anarchy and war, the more they judged it\r\nindispensable that the ruling power should be placed in the hands of\r\nconsiderate, able, and prudent men, capable of understanding their\r\nfunctions, and of making themselves understood in their turn. For a\r\nconsiderable time they had ceased to retain any confidence in the\r\ncompanions of exile and courtiers of Louis XVIII.; and late experience\r\nhad redoubled their mistrust. They looked upon the old Royalist party as\r\ninfinitely more capable of ruining kings than of governing states.\r\n\r\nA personal witness to these conflicting doubts of the foreign Powers as\r\nto the future they were tracing themselves, M. de Talleyrand, at Vienna,\r\nhad also his own misgivings. Amidst all the varied transformations of\r\nhis life and politics, and although the last change had made him the\r\nrepresentative of the ancient royalty, he did not desire, and never had\r\ndesired, to separate himself entirely from the Revolution; he was linked\r\nto it by too many decided acts, and had acknowledged and served it\r\nunder too many different forms, not to feel himself defeated when the\r\nRevolution was subdued. Without being revolutionary either by nature or\r\ninclination, it was in that camp that he had grown up and prospered, and\r\nhe could not desert it with safety. There are certain defections which\r\nskilful egotism takes care to avoid; but the existing state of public\r\naffairs, and his own particular position, pressed conjointly and\r\nweightily upon him at this juncture. What would become of the\r\nrevolutionary cause and its partisans under the second Restoration, now\r\nimminently approaching? What would even be the fate of this second\r\nRestoration if it could not govern and uphold itself better than its\r\npredecessor? Under the second, as under the first, M. de Talleyrand\r\nplayed a distinguished part, and rendered important services to the\r\nRoyal cause. What would be the fruit of this as regarded himself? Would\r\nhis advice be taken, and his co-operation be accepted? Would the\r\nAbbe de Montesquiou and M. de Blacas still be his rivals? I do not\r\nbelieve he would have hesitated, at this epoch, as to which cause he\r\nshould espouse; but feeling his own power, and knowing that the Bourbons\r\ncould scarcely dispense with him, he allowed his predilections for the\r\npast and his doubts for the future to betray themselves.\r\n\r\nWell informed of all these facts, and of the dispositions of the\r\nprincipal actors, the Constitutional Royalists who were then gathered\r\nround M. Royer-Collard, considered it their duty to lay before Louis\r\nXVIII., without reserve, their opinions of the state of affairs, and of\r\nthe line of conduct it behoved him to adopt. It was not only desirable\r\nto impress on him the necessity of perseverance in a system of\r\nconstitutional government, and in the frank acknowledgment of the state\r\nof social feeling in France, such as the new times had made it; but it\r\nwas also essential to enter into the question of persons, and to tell\r\nthe King that the presence of M. de Blacas near him would militate\r\nstrongly against his cause; to request the dismissal of that favourite,\r\nand to call for some explicit act or public declaration, clearly\r\nindicating the intentions of the monarch on the eve of re-assuming\r\npossession of his kingdom; and finally to induce him to attach much\r\nweight to the opinions and influence of M. de Talleyrand, with whom it\r\nmust be observed that, at this period, none of those who gave this\r\nadvice had any personal connection, and to the greater part of whom he\r\nwas decidedly objectionable.\r\n\r\nBeing the youngest and most available of this small assembly, I was\r\ncalled on to undertake a mission not very agreeable in itself. I\r\naccepted the duty without hesitation. Although I had then little\r\nexperience of political animosities and their blind extremes, I could\r\nnot avoid perceiving which party of opponents would one day be likely to\r\nturn on me for taking this step; but I should feel ashamed of myself if\r\nfear of responsibility and apprehensions for the future could hold me\r\nback when circumstances call upon me to act, within the limits of duty\r\nand conviction, as the good of my country demands.\r\n\r\nI left Paris on the 23rd of May. One circumstance alone is worthy of\r\nnotice in my journey--the facility with which I accomplished it. It is\r\ntrue there were many police restrictions on the roads and along the\r\nfrontier; but the greater part of the agents were neither zealous nor\r\nparticular in enforcing them. Their speech, their silence, and their\r\nlooks, implied a kind of understood permission and tacit connivance.\r\nMore than one official face appeared to say to the unknown traveller,\r\n\"Pass on quickly,\" as if they dreaded making a mistake, or damaging a\r\nuseful work by interfering with its supposed design. Having arrived at\r\nGhent, I called first on the men I knew, and whose views corresponded\r\nwith my own, MM. de Jaucourt, Louis, Beugnot, de Lally-Tolendal, and\r\nMounier. I found them all faithful to the cause of the Constitution, but\r\nsad as exiles, and anxious as advisers without repose in banishment; for\r\nthey had to combat incessantly with the odious or absurd passions and\r\nplans of the spirit of reaction.\r\n\r\nThe same facts furnish to different parties the most opposite\r\nconclusions and arguments; the catastrophe, which again attached some\r\nmore firmly than ever to the principles and politics of the Charter, was\r\nto others the sentence of the Charter; and a convincing proof that\r\nnothing but a return to the old system could save the monarchy. I need\r\nnot repeat the details, given to me by my friends, of the advice with\r\nwhich the counter-revolutionists and partisans of absolutism beset the\r\nKing; for in the idleness that succeeds misfortune, men give themselves\r\nup to dreams, and helpless passion engenders folly. The King stood firm,\r\nand agreed with his constitutional advisers. The Report on the state of\r\nFrance presented to him by M. de Chateaubriand a few days before we\r\narrived, in the name of the whole Council, and which had just been\r\npublished in the 'Moniteur of Ghent,' contained an eloquent exposition\r\nof the liberal policy acknowledged by the monarch. But the party thus\r\nrejected were not disposed to yield; they surrounded the King they were\r\nunable to control, and found their strongest roots in his own family and\r\nbosom friends. The Count d'Artois was their ostensible chief, and\r\nM. de Blacas their discreet but steady ally. Through them they hoped to\r\ngain a victory as necessary as it was difficult.\r\n\r\nI requested the Duke de Duras to demand for me a private audience of the\r\nKing. The King received me the next day, June 1st, and detained me\r\nnearly an hour. I have no turn for the minute and settled parade of such\r\ninterviews; I shall therefore only relate of this, and of the\r\nimpressions which it produced on me, what still appears to be worthy of\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nTwo points have remained strongly imprinted upon my memory--the\r\nimpotence and dignity of the King. There was in the aspect and attitude\r\nof this old man, seated immovably and as if nailed to his arm-chair, a\r\nhaughty serenity, and, in the midst of his feebleness, a tranquil\r\nconfidence in the power of his name and rights, which surprised and\r\ntouched me. What I had to say could not fail to be displeasing to him;\r\nand from respect, not calculation, I began with what was agreeable: I\r\nspoke of the royalist feeling which day by day exhibited itself more\r\nvehemently in Paris. I then related to him several anecdotes and\r\ncouplets of songs, in corroboration of this. Such light passages\r\nentertained and pleased him, as men are gratified with humorous\r\nrecitals, who have no sources of gaiety within themselves.\r\n\r\nI told him that the hope of his return was general. \"But what is\r\ngrievous, Sire, is that, while believing in the re-establishment of the\r\nmonarchy, there is no confidence in its duration.\" \"Why is this?\" I\r\ncontinued; \"when the great artisan of revolution is no longer there,\r\nmonarchy will become permanent; it is clear that, if Bonaparte returns\r\nto Elba, it will only be to break out again; but let him be disposed of,\r\nand there will be an end to revolutions also.--People cannot thus\r\nflatter themselves, Sire; they fear something beyond Bonaparte, they\r\ndread the weakness of the royal government; its wavering between old and\r\nnew ideas, between past and present interests, and they fear the\r\ndisunion, or at least the incoherence of its ministers.\"\r\n\r\nThe King made no reply. I persisted, and mentioned M. de Blacas. I said\r\nthat I was expressly charged by men whom the King knew to be old,\r\nfaithful, and intelligent servants, to represent to him the mistrust\r\nwhich attached itself to that name, and the evil that would result from\r\nit to himself. \"I will fulfil all that I have promised in the Charter;\r\nnames are not concerned with that; France has nothing to do with the\r\nfriends I entertain in my palace, provided no act emanates from them\r\ninjurious to the country? Speak to me of more serious causes of\r\nuneasiness.\" I entered into some details, and touched on various points\r\nof party intrigues and menaces. I also spoke to the King, of the\r\nProtestants in the south, of their alarms, of the violence even of\r\nwhich, in some instances, they had already been the objects. \"This is\r\nvery bad,\" said he: \"I will do all I can to stop it; but I cannot\r\nprevent everything,--I cannot, at the same time, be a liberal and an\r\nabsolute king.\" He questioned me upon several recent occurrences, and\r\nrespecting some members of the Imperial Administration. \"There are two,\r\nSire, who, knowing that I was about to seek an audience of the King,\r\nhave requested me to mention their names, and to assure him of their\r\ndevotion.\" \"Who are they?\"--\"The Arch-chancellor and M. Mole.\" \"For\r\nM. Mole, I rely upon him, and am glad of his support; I know his worth.\r\nAs to M. Cambaceres, he is one of those whom I neither ought nor wish to\r\nhear named.\" I paused there. I was not ignorant that at that time the\r\nKing was in communication with Fouche, a much more objectionable\r\nregicide than Cambaceres; but I was a little surprised that the secret\r\nrelations caused by pressing emergency did not prevent him from\r\nmaintaining aloud, and as a general theory, a line of conduct most\r\nnatural under his circumstances. He was certainly far from foreseeing\r\nthe disgust that would ensue from his connection with the Duke of\r\nOtranto. He dismissed me with some commonplace words of kindness,\r\nleaving on me the impression of a sensible and liberal mind, outwardly\r\nimposing, shrewd with individuals, careful of appearances, thinking\r\nlittle, and not profoundly informed, and almost as incapable of the\r\nerrors which destroy, as of the great strokes which establish the future\r\nof royal dynasties.\r\n\r\nI then visited M. de Blacas. He had evinced some prepossession against\r\nme. \"What brings this young man here?\" said he to Baron d'Eckstein,\r\nCommissary-General of Police to the King of the Netherlands, at Ghent.\r\n\"He comes from I know not who, with some mission that I am ignorant of,\r\nto the King.\" He was fully acquainted both with my mission and my\r\nfriends. However, he received me with perfect civility, and I must add\r\nwith honourable frankness, inquiring what they said at Paris, and why\r\nthey were so incensed against him. He spoke to me even of his\r\ndifferences with the Abbe de Montesquiou, complaining of the sallies and\r\nwhims which had embroiled them to the detriment of the King's service. I\r\nreplied with equal candour; and his bearing during the whole of our\r\ninterview was dignified, with a slight degree of reserve, expressing\r\nmore surprise than irritation. I find in some notes written after I left\r\nhim, this sentence:--\"I am much mistaken if his mistakes do not chiefly\r\nproceed from the mediocrity of his intellect.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation of M. de Chateaubriand at Ghent was singular. A member of\r\nthe King's Council, he brilliantly exposed its policy in official\r\npublications, and defended them in the 'Moniteur of Ghent' with the same\r\nattractive power; but he was dissatisfied with everybody, and no one\r\nplaced much confidence in him. I believe that neither then nor later did\r\nthe King or the different Cabinets understand M. de Chateaubriand, or\r\nsufficiently appreciate his concurrence or hostility. He was, I admit, a\r\ntroublesome ally; for he aspired to all things, and complained of all.\r\nOn a level with the rarest spirits and most exalted imaginations, it was\r\nhis chimera to fancy himself equal to the greatest masters in the art of\r\ngovernment, and to feel bitterly hurt if he were not looked upon as the\r\nrival of Napoleon as well as of Milton. Prudent men did not lend\r\nthemselves to this complaisant idolatry; but they forgot too much what,\r\neither as friend or enemy, he to whom they refused it was worth. They\r\nmight, by paying homage to his genius and satisfying his vanity, have\r\nlulled to rest his ambitious dreams; and if they had not the means of\r\ncontenting him, they ought in either case, from prudence as well as from\r\ngratitude, not only to have humoured, but to have gained him over\r\ncompletely to their side. He was one of those towards whom ingratitude\r\nwas as dangerous as unjust; for they resent passionately, and know how\r\nto revenge without treachery. He lived at Ghent in great intimacy with\r\nM. Bertin, and assumed thenceforward that influence over the 'Journal\r\ndes Debats' which he afterwards so powerfully employed. Notwithstanding\r\nthe cordiality of our first acquaintance, there had been for some time a\r\nconsiderable coolness between us. In 1814 he was discontented with, and\r\nspoke ill of the Abbe de Montesquiou and his friends. I was nevertheless\r\nequally surprised at and sorry for the injustice and error committed in\r\nthinking so little of one they used so much, and I regretted not meeting\r\nhim oftener, and on a more amicable footing.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these discussions, not only of principles and parties,\r\nbut of private interests and coteries, we waited, at a distance from\r\nFrance, and scarcely knowing how to occupy our minds or time, the issue\r\nof the struggle between Napoleon and Europe;--a most painful situation,\r\nwhich I endured to serve the cause I believed and have never ceased to\r\nbelieve just, though I hourly felt its complicated vexations. I shall\r\nnot linger here to describe them; nothing is more repugnant to my\r\nnature than to volunteer a display of my own feelings, especially when I\r\nam well aware that many, who listen, cannot or will not understand or\r\nbelieve me. I care little for mistake or invective; either is the\r\nnatural condition of public life: but I do not feel called upon to enter\r\ninto useless controversies in my own defence; I know how to wait for\r\njustice without demanding it.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Waterloo terminated our passive anxiety. The King quitted\r\nGhent on the 22nd of June, urged by his trustiest friends, and by his\r\nown judgment, not to lose a moment in placing himself between divided\r\nFrance and foreign invasion. I set out the next day with M. Mounier, and\r\non the same evening we rejoined the King at Mons, where he had paused in\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nThen burst forth, through the agency of new actors, and by contrivances\r\nstill unexplained, the _denoument_ that I had been despatched to\r\naccomplish--the fall of M. de Blacas. I am not disposed to discuss the\r\nvarious accounts given by several who were witnesses of or interested in\r\nthe event; I shall simply relate what I myself saw on the spot, as I\r\nfind it detailed in a letter written at Cambray, six days\r\nafterwards,[10] to the person to whom, in the absence of immediate\r\ncommunication, I had the pleasure of relating all that occurred:--\r\n\r\n\"As we entered Mons (M. Mounier and I), we were told that M. de Blacas\r\nhad been dismissed, and was going as ambassador to Naples; but our\r\nsurprise was great when we also learned that M. de Talleyrand, who had\r\nlately left Vienna for Brussels, to be within reach of coming events,\r\nand had arrived at Mons a few hours after the King, had at the same time\r\ntendered his resignation; that the King, while refusing to accept it,\r\nhad received M. de Talleyrand himself coldly, and that he had set out\r\nagain for Brussels, while, contrary to his advice, the King repaired to\r\nCateau-Cambresis, at that moment the head-quarters of the English army.\r\nWe understood nothing whatever of these conflicting incidents, and our\r\nuneasiness equalled our surprise. We have since been everywhere, we have\r\nseen everybody,--those of our friends who preceded us to Mons, and the\r\nforeign ministers who followed the King--MM. de Jaucourt, Louis,\r\nBeugnot, de Chateaubriand, Pozzo di Borgo, de Vincent;--and, between\r\nhalf confidences, restrained anger, deceptive smiles, and sincere\r\nregrets, we have arrived at last at a tolerably clear understanding of\r\nthe whole matter. The little court of the Count d'Artois, knowing that\r\nM. de Talleyrand advised the King not to hurry, and that the Duke of\r\nWellington, on the contrary, recommended him to advance rapidly into\r\nFrance, thought nothing could be better than to drive away both\r\nM. de Blacas and M. de Talleyrand, and to separate the King from his\r\nconstitutional advisers, as well as from his favourite, by inducing him\r\nto set out quickly for the head-quarters of the English army, surrounded\r\nonly by the partisans of _Monsieur_, from whom they hoped he would\r\nselect his ministers.\r\n\r\n\"Our friends were much excited, and the foreigners greatly displeased.\r\nThe latter demanded in whom they could have confidence with regard to\r\nthe French question, and with whom they should treat in such a crisis?\r\nM. de Talleyrand had returned from Vienna with a great reputation for\r\nability and success; in the eyes of Europe he represented France and the\r\nKing. The Austrian Minister had just said to him at Brussels, 'I am\r\nordered to consult you on every occasion, and to be guided entirely by\r\nyour advice.' He himself haughtily maintained his discontent, and\r\nsharply repulsed those who would have persuaded him to rejoin the King.\r\nAfter six hours of rather stormy conversation, it was agreed that Pozzo\r\ndi Borgo should repair to Cateau, and persuade the Duke of Wellington to\r\ntake some step which should put an end to this strange misunderstanding;\r\nand that MM. de Jaucourt, Louis, and Beugnot should at the same time say\r\nto the King, that the men in whom he appeared to confide entertained\r\nideas and projects so diametrically opposed to theirs, that it was\r\nimpossible they could serve him usefully, and therefore requested\r\npermission to retire. It is probable that reflections and measures in\r\nconformity with these resolutions had already taken place at Cateau; for\r\non the morning of the 25th, at the same time that we received news of\r\nthe occurrences at Paris, the abdication of Napoleon, and the embassy of\r\nthe Commissioners to the Allied Sovereigns, a letter arrived at Mons,\r\nfrom the Duke of Wellington to M. de Talleyrand, couched, as I have been\r\nassured, in these exact terms:--\r\n\r\n\"'I regret much that you have not accompanied the King to this place; it\r\nis I who have earnestly requested him to enter France at the same time\r\nwith ourselves. If I could have told you the motives which sway me in\r\nthis matter, I have no doubt that you would have given the King the\r\nsame advice. I trust that you will come to hear them.' M. de Talleyrand\r\ndecided upon setting out instantly; and we determined to accompany him.\r\nWe rejoined the King here on the 26th. It was high time; for already a\r\nproclamation, dated from Cateau, drawn up, it is said, by M. Dambray,\r\ngave a false colouring to the re-entrance of his Majesty. We have\r\nhastened to substitute another, of which M. Beugnot is the principal\r\nauthor, and which prognosticates a wholesome policy. The King signed it\r\nwithout hesitation. It appeared yesterday, to the great satisfaction of\r\nthe public of Cambray. I hope it may produce a similar effect in all\r\nother quarters.\"\r\n\r\nWe indeed hoped and believed that the end of the great crisis which had\r\noverthrown France, as well as the smaller one which had agitated the\r\nimmediate circle of royalty, was at hand. On all sides affairs appeared\r\nto tend towards the same issue. The King was in France; a moderate and\r\nnational line of policy prevailed in his councils, and animated his\r\nwords. A feeling of loyalty displayed itself everywhere during his\r\nprogress, not only with his old party, but amongst the masses; every\r\nhand was raised towards him, as to a plank of safety in a shipwreck. The\r\npeople care little for consistency. At this time I saw, in the northern\r\ndepartments, the same popularity surround the exiled King and the\r\nvanquished army. Napoleon had abdicated in Paris, and, notwithstanding a\r\nfew unworthy alternations of dejection and feverish excitement, of\r\nresignation and momentary energy, he was evidently incapable of renewing\r\nthe struggle. The Chamber of Representatives, which, from its first\r\ninstitution, had shown itself unfavourable to the Imperial system, and\r\nopposed to revolutionary excesses, appeared to be earnestly occupied in\r\nthreading a perilous defile, by avoiding all violence and every\r\nirrevocable engagement. Popular passion sometimes murmured, but suffered\r\nitself to be easily restrained, and even stopped voluntarily, as if\r\nunaccustomed to action or dominion. The army, the scattered corps of\r\nwhich had successively re-united round Paris, had given itself up to\r\npatriotic fervour, and, together with France, had plunged into an abyss\r\nto prove its devotion and avenge its injuries: but amongst its oldest\r\nand most illustrious chiefs, some--such as Gouvion St. Cyr, Macdonald,\r\nand Oudinot--had refused to join Napoleon, and openly espoused the Royal\r\ncause; others--like Ney, Davoust, Soult, and Massena--protested with\r\nstern candour against fatal delusions, considering that their well-tried\r\ncourage entitled them to utter melancholy truths, to offer sage advice,\r\nand to repress, even by the sacrifice of party credit, military\r\nexcitement or popular disorder; others, in fine, like Drouot, with an\r\ninfluence conferred by true courage and virtue, maintained discipline in\r\nthe army in the midst of the mortifications of the retreat behind the\r\nLoire, and secured its obedience to the authority of a detested civil\r\npower. After so many mistakes and misfortunes, and in the midst of all\r\ndifferences of opinion and situation, there existed still a spontaneous\r\ndesire and a general effort to preserve France from irreparable errors\r\nand total ruin.\r\n\r\nBut tardy wisdom does not avail, and, even when they wish to become\r\nprudent, political genius is wanting to those nations who are not\r\naccustomed to decide their own affairs or their own destiny. In the\r\ndeplorable state into which the enterprise of an heroic and chimerical\r\negotism had thrown France, there was evidently only one line of conduct\r\nto pursue,--to recognize Louis XVIII., to accept his liberal\r\nconcessions, and to act in concert with him while treating with the\r\nforeign Powers. This was absolutely necessary; for the most limited mind\r\ncould foresee that the return of the House of Bourbon was an inevitable,\r\nand all but an accomplished fact. Such a course became also a duty, to\r\npromote peace and to afford the best means of counteracting the evils of\r\ninvasion; for Louis XVIII. could alone repel them with any show of\r\nauthority. An auspicious future was thus opened to liberty; for reason\r\nwhispered, and experience demonstrated, that, after what had passed in\r\nFrance since 1789, despotism could never more be attempted by the\r\nprinces of the House of Bourbon--an insurmountable necessity compelled\r\nthem to adopt defined and constitutional government,--if they resorted\r\nto extremes, their strength would prove unequal to success. To accept\r\nwithout hesitation or delay the second restoration, and to place the\r\nKing, of his own accord, between France and the rest of Europe, became\r\nthe self-evident dictate of patriotism and sound policy.\r\n\r\nNot only was this left undone, but every endeavour was used to make it\r\nappear that the Restoration was exclusively the work of foreign\r\ninterference, and to bring upon France, in addition to her military\r\ndefeat, a political and diplomatic overthrow. It was not independence of\r\nthe Empire, or good intentions towards the country, that were wanting\r\nin the Chamber of the Hundred Days, but intelligence and resolution. It\r\nneither lent itself to imperial despotism nor revolutionary violence; it\r\nwas not the instrument of either of the extreme parties,--it applied\r\nitself honestly to preserve France, on the brink of that abyss towards\r\nwhich they had driven her; but it could only pursue a line of negative\r\npolicy, it tacked timidly about before the harbour, instead of boldly\r\nentering,--closing its eyes when it approached the narrow channel,\r\nsubmitting, not from confidence, but from imbecility, to the blindness\r\nor infatuation of the old or new enemies by whom the King was\r\nsurrounded, and appearing sometimes, from weakness itself, to consent to\r\ncombinations which in reality it tried to elude;--at one moment\r\nproclaiming Napoleon II., and at another any monarch whom the sovereign\r\npeople might please to select.\r\n\r\nTo this fruitless vacillation of the only existing public authority, one\r\nof the most fatally celebrated actors of the worst times of the\r\nRevolution, Fouche, owed his importance and ephemeral success.\r\n\r\nWhen honest men fail to understand or execute the designs of Providence,\r\ndishonesty undertakes the task. Under the pressure of circumstances, and\r\nin the midst of general weakness, corrupt, sagacious, and daring spirits\r\nare ever at hand, who perceive at once what may happen, or what may be\r\nattempted, and make themselves the instruments of a triumph to which\r\nthey have no natural claim, but of which they assume the credit, to\r\nappropriate the fruits. Such a man was the Duke of Otranto during the\r\nHundred Days,--a revolutionist transformed into a grandee; and desirous\r\nof being consecrated in this double character by the ancient royalty of\r\nFrance, he employed, to accomplish his end, all the cleverness and\r\naudacity of a reckless intriguer more clear-sighted and sensible than\r\nhis associates. Perhaps also--for justice ought to retain its scruples\r\neven towards those who have none themselves--perhaps a desire to save\r\nhis country from violence and useless suffering may have had some share\r\nin the series of treasons and imperturbable changes of side, by means of\r\nwhich, while deceiving and playing alternately with Napoleon, La\r\nFayette, and Carnot, the Empire, the Republic, and the regicidal\r\nConvention, Fouche gained the time that he required to open for himself\r\nthe doors of the King's cabinet, while he opened the gates of Paris to\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. offered some resistance, but, notwithstanding what he had\r\nsaid to me at Ghent respecting Cambaceres, I doubt whether he objected\r\nstrongly. He was one of those who are dignified from habit and decorum\r\nrather than from a real and powerful emotion of the soul; and propriety\r\ndisappeared before emergency. He had, as vouchers for the necessities of\r\nthe case, two authorities who were the best calculated to influence his\r\ndecision and uphold his honour; the Duke of Wellington and the Count\r\nd'Artois both urged him to accept Fouche as a minister:--Wellington, to\r\nsecure an easy return for the King, and also that he himself, and\r\nEngland with him, might remain the principal author of the Restoration\r\nby promptly terminating the war before Paris, where he feared to be\r\ncompromised through the violent hatred of the Prussians; the Count\r\nd'Artois, with impatient levity, always ready to promise and agree, and\r\nalready entangled through his most active confidant, M. de Vitrolles, in\r\nthe snare which Fouche had spread for the Royalists on every side.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the necessity which they urged upon the King. Fouche\r\nhad no control over Paris; the army had retired; the Federates were more\r\nnoisy than powerful; the Chamber of Representatives consoled themselves,\r\nby discussing a constitution, for not having dared or known how to form\r\na government; no party was either able or disposed to arrest effectually\r\nthe tide which carried the King along. A little less eagerness, and a\r\nlittle more determination, would have spared him a sad dishonour. By\r\nwaiting a few days he would have incurred the risk, not of fatal\r\nresolutions or violence, but merely of the temporary continuance of\r\ndisorder and alarm. Necessity presses upon people as well as on kings:\r\nthat with which Fouche armed himself to become minister to Louis XVIII.\r\nwas factitious and ephemeral; that which brought Louis XVIII. back to\r\nthe Tuileries was real, and became hourly more urgent. There was no\r\noccasion for him to receive the Duke of Otranto into his cabinet at\r\nArnouville; he might have remained there patiently, for they would soon\r\nhave sought him. I thought thus at the time, after having passed two\r\ndays in Paris, where I arrived on the 3rd of July, when the manoeuvres\r\nof Fouche were following their course. All that I subsequently saw and\r\nheard tended to confirm me in this opinion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: I owe it to myself to repeat here the retractation of an\r\nerror (I am not disposed to use any other word) entertained in regard to\r\nmy connection with the Hundred Days, and the part I took at that period.\r\nThis retractation, which appeared thirteen years ago in the 'Moniteur\r\nUniversel' of the 4th of February, 1844, is couched in the following\r\nterms:--\"Several journals have recently said or implied that M. Guizot,\r\nthe present Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was Secretary-General to\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior in 1814 and 1815, had retained his office\r\nduring the Hundred Days, under General Count Carnot, appointed Minister\r\nof the Interior by the Imperial decree of the 20th of March, 1815; that\r\nhe had signed the Additional Act, and that he had been subsequently\r\ndismissed. One of these journals has invoked the testimony of the\r\n'Moniteur.' These assertions are utterly false. M. Guizot, now Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, had, on the 20th of March, 1815, quitted the\r\ndepartment of the Interior; and by an Imperial decree of the 23rd of the\r\nsame month, his office of Secretary-General was conferred upon Baron\r\nBasset de Chateaubourg, formerly Prefect (see the 'Bulletin des Lois,'\r\nno. v. p. 34). The notice in the 'Moniteur' of the 14th of May, 1815,\r\npage 546, did not refer to M. Francois Guizot, but to M. Jean-Jacques\r\nGuizot, head-clerk at that time in the Ministry of the Interior, who was\r\nactually dismissed from his office in the course of May 1815.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this official refutation, founded on official acts, and\r\npublished in 1844 in the 'Moniteur,' where the error had originated, the\r\nsame mis-statement appeared in 1847, in the 'History of the Two\r\nRestorations,' by M. Vaulabelle (2nd edition, vol. ii. p. 276), and\r\nagain in 1851, in the 'History of the Restoration,' by M. de Lamartine\r\n(vol. iv. p. 15).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: June 29th, 1815.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMBER OF 1815.\r\n\r\n1815-1816.\r\n\r\n     FALL OF M.

They had fallen, not\r\nunder the pressure of any new or unforeseen event, but by the evils\r\nconnected with their personal situation, and their inaptitude for the\r\nparts they had undertaken to play. M. de Talleyrand had effected a\r\nmiracle at Vienna; by the treaty of alliance concluded on the 3rd\r\nJanuary, 1815, between France, England, and Austria, he had put an end\r\nto the coalition formed against us in 1813, and separated Europe into\r\ntwo parties, to the advantage of France. But the event of the 20th of\r\nMarch had destroyed his work; the European coalition was again formed\r\nagainst the Emperor and against France, who had made herself, or had\r\npermitted herself to be made, the instrument of Napoleon. There was no\r\nlonger a chance of breaking up this formidable alliance. The same\r\nfeeling of uneasiness and mistrust of our faith, the same desire for a\r\nfirm and lasting union, animated the sovereigns and the nations. They\r\nhad speedily arranged at Vienna the questions which had threatened to\r\ndivide them. In this fortified hostility against France the Emperor\r\nAlexander participated, with extreme irritation towards the House of\r\nBourbon and M. de Talleyrand, who had sought to deprive him of his\r\nallies. The second Restoration was no longer like the first, the\r\npersonal glory and work of M. de Talleyrand; the honour was chiefly due\r\nto England and the Duke of Wellington. Instigated by self-love and\r\npolicy, the Emperor Alexander arrived at Paris on the 10th of July,\r\n1815, stern and angrily disposed towards the King and his advisers.\r\n\r\nFrance and the King stood, nevertheless, in serious need of the goodwill\r\nof the Russian Emperor, encompassed as they were by the rancorous and\r\neager ambition of Germany. Her diplomatists drew up the geographical\r\nchart of our territory, leaving out the provinces of which they desired\r\nto deprive us. Her generals undermined, to blow into the air, the\r\nmonuments which recalled their defeats in the midst of their victories.\r\nLouis XVIII. resisted with much dignity these acts of foreign barbarism;\r\nhe threatened to place his chair of state upon the bridge of Jena, and\r\nsaid publicly to the Duke of Wellington, \"Do you think, my Lord, that\r\nyour Government would consent to receive me if I were again to solicit a\r\nrefuge?\" Wellington restrained to the utmost of his power the violence\r\nof Bluecher, and remonstrated with him by arguments equally urgent and\r\npolitic; but neither the dignity of the King, nor the amicable\r\nintervention of England were sufficient to curb the overweening\r\npretensions of Germany. The Emperor Alexander alone could keep them\r\nwithin bounds. M. de Talleyrand sought to conciliate him by personal\r\nconcessions. In forming his cabinet, he named the Duke de Richelieu, who\r\nwas still absent, Minister of the Royal Household, while the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior was held in reserve for Pozzo di Borgo, who would willingly\r\nhave left the official service of Russia to take part in the Government\r\nof France. M. de Talleyrand placed much faith in the power of\r\ntemptations; but, in this instance, they were of no avail. The\r\nDuke de Richelieu, probably in concert with the King himself, refused;\r\nPozzo di Borgo did not obtain, or dared not to solicit, the permission\r\nof his master to become, once more, a Frenchman. I saw him frequently,\r\nand that mind, at once quick and decisive, bold and restless, felt\r\nkeenly its doubtful situation, and with difficulty concealed its\r\nperplexities. The Emperor Alexander maintained his cold reserve, leaving\r\nM. de Talleyrand powerless and embarrassed in this arena of negotiation,\r\nordinarily the theatre of his success.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Fouche was different, and sprang from other causes. It\r\nwas not that the foreign sovereigns and their ministers regarded him\r\nmore favourably than they did M. de Talleyrand, for his admission into\r\nthe King's cabinet had greatly scandalized monarchical Europe; the Duke\r\nof Wellington alone persisted in still upholding him; but none amongst\r\nthe foreigners either attacked him or appeared anxious for his downfall.\r\nIt was from within that the storm was raised against him. With a\r\nstrangely frivolous presumption, he had determined to deliver up the\r\nRevolution to the King, and the King to the Revolution, relying upon his\r\ndexterity and boldness to assist him in passing and repassing from camp\r\nto camp, and in governing one by the other, while alternately betraying\r\nboth. The elections which took place at this period throughout France,\r\nsignally falsified his hopes. In vain did he profusely employ agents,\r\nand circular addresses; neither obtained for him the slightest\r\ninfluence; the decided Royalists prevailed in nearly every quarter,\r\nalmost without a struggle. It is our misfortune and our weakness, that\r\nin every great crisis the vanquished become as the dead. The Chamber of\r\n1815 as yet appeared only in the distance, and already the Duke of\r\nOtranto trembled as though thunderstruck by the side of the tottering\r\nM. de Talleyrand. In this opposite and unequal peril, but critical for\r\nboth, the conduct of these two men was very different. M. de Talleyrand\r\nproclaimed himself the patron of constitutional monarchy, boldly and\r\ngreatly organized as in England. Modifications conformable to the views\r\nof the Liberal party were in some instances immediately acceded to, and\r\nin others promised by the Charter. Young men were permitted to enter\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. Fourteen Articles relative to the constitution\r\nof this Chamber were submitted for the inspection of the next\r\nLegislative Assembly. The Peerage was made hereditary. The censorship,\r\nto which works under twenty printed sheets had been subjected, was\r\nabolished. A grand Privy Council, on important occasions, united the\r\nprincipal men of every party. It was neither the urgent necessity of the\r\nmoment, nor prevailing public opinion, that imposed on restored royalty\r\nthese important reforms: they were enacted by the Cabinet from a desire\r\nof encouraging free institutions, and of giving satisfaction to the\r\nparty,--I ought rather to say to the small section of enlightened and\r\nimpatient spirits.\r\n\r\nThe real intentions and measures of Fouche were of a more personal\r\nnature. Violently menaced by the reaction in favour of royalty, he at\r\nfirst endeavoured to appease by feeding it. He consented to make himself\r\nthe instrument of proscription against the very men who, but a short\r\ntime before, were his agents, his confederates, his accomplices, his\r\ncolleagues, and his friends. At the same time that he published\r\nmemorials and circulars showing the necessity of clemency and\r\nforgetfulness of the past, he placed before the Royal Council a list of\r\none hundred and ten names, to be excluded from all amnesty; and when\r\nstrict inquiry had reduced this number to eighteen, subject to\r\ncourts-martial, and to thirty-eight provisionally banished, he\r\ncountersigned without hesitation the decree which condemned them. A few\r\ndays afterwards, and upon his request, another edict revoked all the\r\nprivileges hitherto accorded to the daily papers, imposed upon them the\r\nnecessity of a new license, and subjected them to the censorship of a\r\ncommission, in which several of the principal royalist writers, amongst\r\nothers Messieurs Auger and Fievee, refused to sit under his patronage.\r\nAs little did the justice or national utility of his acts affect the\r\nDuke of Otranto in 1815, as in 1793; he was always ready to become, no\r\nmatter at what cost, the agent of expediency. But when he saw that his\r\nsevere measures did not protect himself, and perceived the rapidly\r\napproaching danger, he changed his tactics; the minister of the\r\nmonarchical reaction became again the factious revolutionist. He caused\r\nto be secretly published and circulated, \"Reports to the King,\" and the\r\n\"Notes to the Foreign Ministers,\" less calculated to enlighten the\r\nauthorities he addressed, than to prepare for himself arms and allies\r\nagainst the Government and the party, from which he saw that he was\r\nabout to be excluded. He was of the number of those who try to make\r\nthemselves feared, by striving to injure when they are no longer\r\npermitted to serve.\r\n\r\nNeither the liberal reforms of M. de Talleyrand, nor the revolutionary\r\nmenaces of the Duke of Otranto, warded off the danger which pressed on\r\nthem. Notwithstanding their extraordinary abilities and long experience,\r\nboth mistook the new aspect of the times, either not seeing, or not\r\nwishing to see, how little they were in unison with the contests which\r\nthe Hundred Days had revived. The election of a Chamber decidedly\r\nRoyalist, surprised them as an unexpected phenomenon; they both fell at\r\nits approach, and within a few days of each other; left, nevertheless,\r\nafter their common downfall, in opposite positions. M. de Talleyrand\r\nretained credit; the King and his new Cabinet loaded him with gifts and\r\nroyal favours; his colleagues during his short administration, Messieurs\r\nde Jaucourt, Pasquier, Louis and Gouvion St. Cyr, received signal marks\r\nof royal esteem, and retired from the scene of action as if destined to\r\nreturn. Having accepted the trifling and distant embassy to Dresden,\r\nFouche hastened to depart, and left Paris under a disguise which he only\r\nchanged when he reached the frontier, fearful of being seen in his\r\nnative land, which he was fated never again to behold.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of the Duke de Richelieu entered upon office warmly welcomed\r\nby the King, and even by the party which had gained the ascendency\r\nthrough the present elections. It was indeed a new and thoroughly\r\nroyalist Ministry. Its head, recently arrived in France, honoured by all\r\nEurope, and beloved by the Emperor Alexander, was to King Louis XVIII.\r\nwhat the king himself was to France, the pledge of a more advantageous\r\npeace. Two of his colleagues, Messieurs Decazes and Dubouchage, had\r\ntaken no part in public affairs previous to the Restoration. The four\r\nothers, Messieurs Barbe-Marbois, de Vaublanc, Coretto, and the Duke of\r\nFeltri, had recently given proofs of strong attachment to the regal\r\ncause. Their union inspired hope without suspicion, in the public mind,\r\nas well as in that of the triumphant party. I was intimately acquainted\r\nwith M. de Marbois; I had frequently met him at the houses of\r\nMadame de Rumford and Madame Suard. He belonged to that old France\r\nwhich, in a spirit of generous liberality, had adopted and upheld, with\r\nenlightened moderation, the principles most cherished by the France of\r\nthe day. I held under him, in the capacity of a confidential friend, the\r\npost of Secretary-General to the Ministry of Justice, to which\r\nM. Pasquier, then keeper of the great seal, had nominated me under the\r\nCabinet of M. de Talleyrand. Hardly was the new minister installed in\r\noffice, when the Chamber of Deputies assembled, and in its turn\r\nestablished itself. It was almost exclusively Royalist. With\r\nconsiderable difficulty, a few men, members of other parties, had\r\nobtained entrance into its ranks. They found themselves in a state of\r\nperpetual discomfort, isolated and ill at ease, as though they were\r\nstrangers of suspicious character; and when they endeavoured to declare\r\nthemselves and explain their sentiments, they were roughly driven back\r\ninto impotent silence. On the 23rd of October, 1815, in the debate on\r\nthe Bill presented by M. Decazes for the temporary suspension of\r\npersonal liberty, M. d'Argenson spoke of the reports which had been\r\nspread abroad respecting the massacre of Protestants in the south. A\r\nviolent tumult arose in contradiction of his statements; he explained\r\nhimself with great reserve. \"I name no facts,\" replied he, \"I bring\r\nforward no charges; I merely say that vague and contradictory rumours\r\nhave reached me; ... the very vagueness of these rumours calls for a report\r\nfrom the minister, on the state of the kingdom.\" M. d'Argenson was not\r\nonly defeated in his object, and interrupted in his speech, but he was\r\nexpressly called to order for having alluded to facts unfortunately too\r\ncertain, but which the Government wished to smother up by silencing all\r\ndebate on the question.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in five-and-twenty years, the Royalists saw\r\nthemselves in the ascendant. Thoroughly believing that they had obtained\r\na legitimate triumph, they indulged unreservedly in the enjoyment of\r\npower, with a mixture of aristocratic arrogance and new-born zeal, as\r\nmen do when little accustomed to victory, and doubtful of the strength\r\nthey are so eager to display.\r\n\r\nVery opposite causes plunged the Chamber of 1815 into the extreme\r\nreaction which has stamped its historical character. In the first place,\r\nand above all others, may be named, the good and evil passions of the\r\nRoyalists, their moral convictions and personal resentments, their love\r\nof order and thirst for vengeance, their pride in the past and their\r\napprehensions for the future, their determination to re-establish honour\r\nand respect for holy observances, their old attachments, their sworn\r\npledges, and the gratification of lording it over their conquerors. To\r\nthe violence of passion was joined a prudent calculation of advantage.\r\nTo strengthen their party, and to advance individual fortunes, it was\r\nessential for the new rulers of France to possess themselves everywhere\r\nof place and power; therein lay the field to be worked, and the\r\nterritory to be occupied, in order to reap the entire fruits of victory.\r\nFinally must be added, the empire of ideas, more influential than is\r\ncommonly supposed, and often exercising more power over men, without\r\ntheir being conscious of it, than prejudice or interest. After so many\r\nyears of extraordinary events and disputes, the Royalists had, on all\r\npolitical and social questions, systematic views to realize, historical\r\nreminiscences to act upon, requirements of the mind to satisfy. They\r\nhastened to apply their hands to the work, believing the day at last\r\narrived when they could, once more, assume in their own land, morally as\r\nwell as physically, in thought and deed, the superiority which had so\r\nlong been wrested from them.\r\n\r\nAs it happens in every great crisis of human associations, these\r\nopposing principles in the reaction of 1815, had each its special and\r\nexclusively effective representative in the ranks of the Royalists. The\r\nparty had their fighting champion, their political advocate, and their\r\nphilosopher. M. de la Bourdonnaye led their passions, M. de Villele\r\ntheir interests, and M. de Bonald their ideas; three men well suited to\r\ntheir parts, for they excelled respectively, the first in fiery attack,\r\nthe second in prudent and patient manoeuvring, and the third in\r\nspecious, subtle, and elevated exposition; and all three, although\r\nunconnected by any previous intimacy, applied their varied talents with\r\nunflinching perseverance to the common cause.\r\n\r\nAnd what, after all, was the cause? What was, in reality, the end which\r\nthe leaders of the party, apparently on the very verge of success,\r\nproposed to themselves? Had they been inclined to speak sincerely, they\r\nwould have found it very difficult to answer the question. It has been\r\nsaid and believed by many, and probably a great portion of the Royalists\r\nimagined, in 1815, that their object was to abolish the Charter, and\r\nrestore the old system: a commonplace supposition of puerile credulity;\r\nthe battle-cry of the enemies, whether able or blind, of the\r\nRestoration. In the height of its most sanguine hopes, the Chamber of\r\n1815 had formed no idea so extreme or audacious. Replaced as conquerors\r\nupon the field, not by themselves, but by the errors of their\r\nadversaries and the course of European events, the old Royalist party\r\nexpected that the reverses of the Revolution and the Empire would bring\r\nthem enormous advantages, and restitution; but they were yet undecided\r\nas to the use they should make of victory in the government of France,\r\nwhen they found themselves in the undisturbed possession of power. Their\r\nviews were as unsettled and confused as their passions were violent;\r\nabove all things, they coveted victory, for the haughty pleasure of\r\ntriumph itself, for the definitive establishment of the Restoration, and\r\nfor their own predominance, by holding power at the centre of\r\ngovernment, and throughout the departments by administration.\r\n\r\nBut in those social shocks there are deeper questions involved than the\r\nactors are aware of. The Hundred Days inflicted on France a much heavier\r\nevil than the waste of blood and treasure it had cost her; they lit up\r\nagain the old quarrel which the Empire had stifled and the Charter was\r\nintended to extinguish,--the quarrel between old and new France, between\r\nthe emigrants and the revolutionists. It was not alone between two\r\npolitical parties, but between two rival classes, that the struggle\r\nrecommenced in 1815, as it originally exploded in 1789.\r\n\r\nAn unfavourable position for founding a Government, and, above all, a\r\nfree Government. A certain degree of excitement and emulation invariably\r\nexists between the people and the political parties, which constitutes\r\nthe very life of the social body, and encourages its energetic and\r\nwholesome development. But if this agitation is not confined to\r\nquestions of legislature and the conduct of public affairs,--if it\r\nattacks society in its very basis,--if, instead of emulation between\r\nparties, there arises hostility amongst classes, the movement ceases to\r\nbe healthy, and changes to a destroying malady, which leads on to the\r\nmost lamentable disorders, and may end in the dissolution of the State.\r\nThe undue ascendency of one class over another, whether of the\r\naristocracy or the people, becomes tyranny. The bitter and continued\r\nstruggle of either to obtain the upper hand, is in fact revolution,\r\nimminently impending or absolutely declared. The world has witnessed, in\r\ntwo great examples, the diametrically opposite results to which this\r\nformidable fact may lead. The contest between the Patricians and\r\nPlebeians held Rome for ages between the cruel alternations of despotism\r\nand anarchy, which had no variety but war. As long as either party\r\nretained public virtue, the republic found grandeur, if not social\r\npeace, in their quarrel; but when Patricians and Plebeians became\r\ncorrupted by dissension, without agreeing on any fixed principle of\r\nliberty, Rome could only escape from ruin by falling under the despotism\r\nand lingering decline of the Empire. England presents to modern Europe a\r\ndifferent spectacle. In England also, the opposing parties of nobles and\r\ndemocrats long contended for the supremacy; but, by a happy combination\r\nof fortune and wisdom, they came to a mutual compromise, and united in\r\nthe common exercise of power: and England has found, in this amicable\r\nunderstanding between the different classes, in this communion of their\r\nrights and mutual influence, internal peace with greatness, and\r\nstability with freedom.\r\n\r\nI looked forward to an analogous result for my own country, from the\r\nform of government established by the Charter. I have been accused of\r\ndesiring to model France upon the example of England. In 1815, my\r\nthoughts were not turned towards England; at that time I had not\r\nseriously studied her institutions or her history. I was entirely\r\noccupied with France, her destinies, her civilization, her laws, her\r\nliterature, and her great men. I lived in the heart of a society\r\nexclusively French, more deeply impregnated with French tastes and\r\nsentiments than any other. I was immediately associated with that\r\nreconciliation, blending, and intercourse of different classes, and even\r\nof parties, which seemed to me the natural condition of our new and\r\nliberal system. People of every origin, rank, and calling, I may almost\r\nsay of every variety of opinion,--great noblemen, magistrates,\r\nadvocates, ecclesiastics, men of letters, fashion, or business, members\r\nof the old aristocracy, of the Constituent Assembly, of the Convention,\r\nof the Empire,--lived in easy and hospitable intercourse, adopting\r\nwithout hesitation their altered positions and views, and all apparently\r\ndisposed to act together in goodwill for the advantage of their country.\r\nA strange contradiction in our habits and manners! When social\r\nrelations, applicable to mental or worldly pleasures, are alone\r\ninvolved, there are no longer distinctions of classes, or contests;\r\ndifferences of situation and opinion cease to exist; we have no thought\r\nbut to enjoy and contribute in common our mutual possessions,\r\npretensions, and recommendations. But let political questions and the\r\npositive interests of life once more spring up,--let us be called upon,\r\nnot merely to assemble for enjoyment or recreation, but to assume each\r\nhis part in the rights, the affairs, the honours, the advantages, and\r\nthe burdens of the social system,--on the instant, all dissensions\r\nre-appear; all pretences, prejudices, susceptibilities, and oppositions\r\nrevive; and that society which had seemed so single and united, resumes\r\nall its former divisions and differences.\r\n\r\nThis melancholy incoherence between the apparent and actual state of\r\nFrench society revealed itself suddenly in 1815. The reaction provoked\r\nby the Hundred Days destroyed in the twinkling of an eye the work of\r\nsocial reconciliation carried on in France for sixteen years, and caused\r\nthe abrupt explosion of all the passions, good or evil, of the social\r\nsystem, against all the works, beneficial or mischievous, of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nAttacked also by another difficulty, the party which prevailed at the\r\nopening of the session, in the Chamber of 1815, fell into another\r\nmistake. The aristocratic classes in France, although generously\r\ndevoted, in public dangers, to the king and the country, knew not how to\r\nmake common cause either with the crown or the people; they have\r\nalternately blamed and opposed, royal power and public liberty.\r\nIsolating themselves in the privileges which satisfied their vanity\r\nwithout giving them real influence in the State, they had not assumed,\r\nfor three centuries, either with the monarch, or at the head of the\r\nnation, the position which seemed naturally to belong to them. After all\r\nthey had lost, and in spite of all they ought to have learned at the\r\nRevolution, they found themselves in 1815, when power reverted to their\r\nhands, in the same undefined and shifting position. In its relations\r\nwith the great powers of the State, in public discussion, in the\r\nexercise of its peculiar rights, the Chamber of 1815 had the merit of\r\ncarrying into vigorous practice the constitutional system, which, in\r\n1814, had scarcely emerged from its torpor under the Empire; but in its\r\nnew work it lost sight of equity, moderation, and the favourable moment.\r\nIt wished at the same time to control France and the King. It was\r\nindependent and haughty, often revolutionary in its conduct towards the\r\nmonarch, and equally violent and contra-revolutionary as regarded the\r\npeople. This was to attempt too much; it ought to have chosen between\r\nthe two, and to have declared itself either monarchical or popular. The\r\nChamber of 1815 was neither the one nor the other. It appeared to be\r\ndeeply imbued with the spirit of the old system, envenomed by the ideas\r\nor examples of the spirit of the revolution; but the spirit of\r\ngovernment, even more essential under constitutional than under absolute\r\npower, was wanting altogether.\r\n\r\nThus, an opposition was seen to spring up quickly within its own\r\nbosom,--an opposition which became at once popular and monarchical, for\r\nit equally defended against the ruling party, the crown they had so\r\nrashly insulted, and the country they had profoundly disturbed. After\r\nsome sharp contests, sustained with acrimonious determination on both\r\nsides, this opposition, strong in the royal support as in public\r\nsympathy, frequently obtained a majority, and became the party of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI had no seat at that time in the Chamber of Deputies. It has often been\r\nsaid that I took a more important share in the Government of the day\r\nthan could be attributed to me with truth. I have never complained of\r\nthis, nor shall I complain now. I accept the responsibility, not only of\r\nmy own actions, but of those of the friends I selected and supported.\r\nThe monarchical and constitutional party formed in 1815, became on the\r\ninstant my own. I shall acknowledge frankly what experience has taught\r\nme of their mistakes, while I feel proud of having been enrolled in\r\ntheir ranks.\r\n\r\nThis party was formed abruptly and spontaneously, without premeditated\r\nobject, without previous or personal concert, under the simple necessity\r\nof the moment, to meet a pressing evil, and not to establish any\r\nparticular system, or any specific combination of ideas, resolutions, or\r\ndesigns. Its sole policy was at first confined to the support of the\r\nRestoration against the reaction: a thankless undertaking, even when\r\nmost salutary; for it is useless to contend with a headlong\r\ncounter-current. While you are supporting the power whose flag serves as\r\na cloak to reaction, it is impossible to arrest the entire mischief you\r\ndesire to check; and you seem to adopt that which you have been unable\r\nto subdue. This is one of the inevitable misconstructions which honest\r\nmen, who act conscientiously, in stormy days, must be prepared to\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nNeither in its composition nor plans had the new Royalist party any\r\nspecial or decided character. Amongst its rising leaders, as in its more\r\nundistinguished ranks, there were men of every origin and position,\r\ncollected from all points of the social and political horizon.\r\nM. de Serre was an emigrant, and had been a lieutenant in the army of\r\nConde; MM. Pasquier, Beugnot, Simeon, Barante and St. Aulaire, had\r\npossessed influence under Napoleon; MM. Royer-Collard and Camille Jordan\r\nwere opposed to the Imperial system. The same judgment, the same opinion\r\nupon the events of the day and the chances of the morrow, upon the\r\nrights and legitimate interests of the throne and country, suddenly\r\nunited these men, hitherto unknown to each other. They combined, as the\r\ninhabitants of the same quarter run from all sides and, without\r\nacquaintance and never having met before, work in concert to extinguish\r\na great fire.\r\n\r\nA fact, however, disclosed itself, which characterized already the new\r\nroyalist party in the impending struggle. Equally disturbed by the\r\npretensions of the old aristocrats, the monarchy and the citizens formed\r\na close league for mutual support. Louis XVIII. and young France resumed\r\ntogether the policy of their fathers. It is fruitless for a people to\r\ndeny or forget the past; they cannot either annihilate or abstract\r\nthemselves from it; situations and emergencies will soon arise to force\r\nthem back into the road on which they have travelled for ages.\r\n\r\nSelected as President by the Chamber itself, and also by the King,\r\nM. Laine, while preserving, with a dignity at the same time natural and\r\nslightly studied, the impartiality which his situation required,\r\ninclined nevertheless towards the opinions of the moderate minority, and\r\nsupported them by his moral influence, sometimes even by his words. The\r\nascendency of his character, the gravity of his manners, and, at\r\ncertain moments, the passionate overflowing of his soul, invested him\r\nwith an authority which his abilities and knowledge would scarcely have\r\nsufficed to command.\r\n\r\nThe Session had not been many days open, and already, from conversation,\r\nfrom the selection of the officials, from the projects of interior\r\nmovement which were announced, the Deputies began to know and arrange\r\nthemselves, but still with doubt and confusion; as, in a battalion\r\nunexpectedly called together, the soldiers assemble in disorder, looking\r\nfor their arms and colours. The Government propositions soon brought the\r\ndifferent parties to broad daylight, and placed them in contest. The\r\nSession commenced, as might be expected, with measures arising from\r\nincidental circumstances. Of the four bills evidently bearing this\r\ncharacter, two--the suspension of personal liberty, and the\r\nestablishment of prevotal courts--were proposed as exceptional and\r\npurely temporary; the others--for the suppression of seditious acts, and\r\nfor a general amnesty--were intended to be definitive and permanent.\r\n\r\nMeasures of expediency, and exceptional laws, have been so often and so\r\nperemptorily condemned in France, that their very name and aspect\r\nsuffice to render them suspicious and hateful,--a natural impression,\r\nafter so much and such bitter experience! They supply notwithstanding,\r\nand particularly under a constitutional government, the least dangerous\r\nas well as the most efficacious method of meeting temporary and urgent\r\nnecessities. It is better to suspend openly, and for a given time, a\r\nparticular privilege, than to pervert, by encroachment and subtlety,\r\nthe fixed laws, so as to adapt them to the emergency of the hour. The\r\nexperience of history, in such cases, confirms the suggestions of\r\nreason. In countries where political liberty is finally established, as\r\nin England, it is precisely after it has obtained a signal triumph, that\r\nthe temporary suspension of one or more of its special securities has,\r\nunder pressing circumstances, been adopted as a Government measure. In\r\nruder and less intelligent times, under the dominion of momentary\r\ndanger, and as an immediate defence, those rigorous and artful statutes\r\nwere enacted in perpetuity, in which all tyrannies have found arms ready\r\nmade, without the odium of forging them, and from which a more advanced\r\ncivilization, at a later period, has found it so difficult to escape.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, I admit, to enable these exceptional laws to accomplish\r\ntheir end without too much danger, that, beyond the scope of their\r\noperation and during their continuance, the country should retain enough\r\ngeneral liberty, and the authorities sufficient real responsibility, to\r\nconfine these measures within their due limits, and to control their\r\nexercise. But, in spite of the blindness and rage of the beaten parties,\r\nwe have only to read the debates in the Chambers of 1815, and the\r\npublications of the time, to be convinced that at that epoch liberty was\r\nfar from having entirely perished; and the history of the ministers who\r\nwere then in power unanswerably demonstrates that they sustained the\r\nweight of a most effective responsibility.\r\n\r\nOf the two temporary bills introduced into the Chamber in 1815, that\r\nrespecting the prevotal courts met with the least opposition. Two very\r\nsuperior men, MM. Royer-Collard and Cuvier, had consented to become its\r\nofficial advocates, in the character of Royal Commissioners; and during\r\nthe discussion, M. Cuvier took the lead. The debate was a very short\r\none; two hundred and ninety members voted for the bill, ten only\r\nrejected it. The division may create surprise. The bill, in principle,\r\ncomprised the heaviest possible infringement on common right, and the\r\nmost formidable in practical application, by the suppression, in these\r\ncourts, of the greater part of the privileges accorded in the ordinary\r\nmodes of jurisdiction. A clause in the bill went almost to deprive the\r\nKing of his prerogative of pardon, by ordering the immediate execution\r\nof the condemned criminals, unless the prevotal court itself assumed the\r\nfunctions of grace by recommending them to royal clemency. One of\r\nthe most enthusiastic Royalists of the right-hand party,\r\nM. Hyde de Neuville, objected energetically, but without effect, to a\r\nclause so harsh and anti-monarchical. The two most intractable of\r\npassions, anger and fear, prevailed in the Chamber; it had its own\r\ncause, as well as that of the King, to defend and avenge, and persuaded\r\nitself that it could neither strike too soon nor too strongly when both\r\nwere attacked.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, as well as on others, the memory of M. Cuvier has been\r\nunjustly treated. He has been accused of pusillanimity and servile\r\nambition. The charge indicates little knowledge of human nature, and\r\ninsults a man of genius on very slight grounds. I lived much with\r\nM. Cuvier. Firmness in mind and action was not his most prominent\r\nquality; but he was neither servile, nor governed by fear in opposition\r\nto his conscience. He loved order, partly for his own personal security,\r\nbut much more for the cause of justice, civilization, the advantage of\r\nsociety, and the progress of intellect. In his complaisance for power,\r\nhe was more governed by sincere inclination than egotism. He was one of\r\nthose who had not learned from experience to place much confidence in\r\nliberty, and whom the remembrance of revolutionary anarchy had rendered\r\neasily accessible to honest and disinterested apprehensions. In times of\r\nsocial disturbance, men of sense and probity often prefer drifting\r\ntowards the shore, to running the risk of being crushed, with many dear\r\nobjects, on the rocks upon which the current may carry them.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the bill which suspended for a year the securities for\r\npersonal liberty, M. Royer-Collard, while supporting the Government,\r\nmarked the independence of his character, and the mistrustful foresight\r\nof the moralist with regard to the power which the politician most\r\ndesired to establish. He demanded that the arbitrary right of\r\nimprisonment should be entrusted only to a small number of functionaries\r\nof high rank, and that the most exalted of all, the Ministers, should in\r\nevery case be considered distinctly responsible. But these amendments,\r\nwhich would have prevented many abuses without interfering with the\r\nnecessary power, were rejected. Inexperience and precipitation were\r\nalmost universal at the moment. The Cabinet and its most influential\r\npartisans in the Chambers had scarcely any knowledge of each other;\r\nneither had yet learned to conceive plans in combination, to settle the\r\nlimits or bearing of their measures, or to enter on a combat with\r\npreconcerted arrangements.\r\n\r\nA combined action and continued understanding, however, between the\r\nGovernment and the moderate Royalists, became every day more\r\nindispensable; for the divergence of several new parties which began to\r\nbe formed, and the extent of their disagreements, manifested themselves\r\nwith increasing strength from hour to hour. In proposing the act\r\nintended to repress sedition, M. de Marbois, a gentle and liberal\r\nnature, inclined to mild government, and little acquainted with the\r\nviolent passions that fermented around him, had merely looked upon these\r\nacts as ordinary offences, and had sent the criminals before the\r\ntribunals of correctional police, to be punished by imprisonment only.\r\nBetter informed as to the intentions of a portion of the Chamber, the\r\ncommittee appointed to examine the bill, of which M. Pasquier was the\r\nchairman, endeavoured to restrain the dissentients, while satisfying\r\nthem to a certain extent. Amongst seditious acts, the committee drew a\r\nline between crimes and offences, assigning crimes to the Court of\r\nAssizes, to be punished by transportation, and prescribing for simple\r\noffences fine and imprisonment. This was still too little for the\r\nultra-members of the party. They demanded the penalty of death, hard\r\nlabour, and confiscation of property. These additions were refused, and\r\nthe Chamber, by a large majority, passed the bill as amended by the\r\ncommittee. Undoubtedly there were members of the right-hand party who\r\nwould not have dared to contest the propositions of MM. Piet and\r\nde Salaberry, but who rejoiced to see them thrown out, and voted for the\r\nbill. How many errors would men escape, and how many evils would they\r\navoid, if they had the courage to act as they think right, and to do\r\nopenly what they desire!\r\n\r\nAll these debates were but preludes to the great battle ready to\r\ncommence, on the most important of the incidental questions before the\r\nChamber. It is with regret that I use the word _question_. The amnesty\r\nwas no longer one. On returning to France, the King, by his proclamation\r\nfrom Cambray, had promised it; and, with kings, to promise is to\r\nperform. What sovereign could refuse the pardon, of which he has given a\r\nglimpse to the condemned criminal? The royal word is not less pledged to\r\na nation than to an individual. But in declaring, on the 28th of June,\r\n1815, that he would only except from pardon \"the authors and instigators\r\nof the plot which had overturned the throne,\" the King had also\r\nannounced \"that the two Chambers would point them out to the punishment\r\nof the laws;\" and when, a month later, the Cabinet had, upon the report\r\nof the Duke of Otranto, arrested the individuals excepted in the two\r\nlists, the decree of the 24th of July again declared that \"the Chambers\r\nshould decide upon those amongst them who should be expatriated or\r\nbrought to trial.\" The Chambers were therefore inevitably compromised.\r\nThe amnesty had been declared, and yet it still remained a question, a\r\nbill was still considered necessary.\r\n\r\nFour members of the Chamber of Deputies hastened to take the\r\ninitiative in this debate, three of them with extreme violence,\r\nM. de la Bourdonnaye being the most vehement of the three. He had\r\nenergy, enthusiasm, independence, political tact as a partisan, and a\r\nfrank and impassioned roughness, which occasionally soared to eloquence.\r\nHis project, it was said, would have brought eleven hundred persons\r\nunder trial. Whatever might be the correctness of this calculation, the\r\nthree propositions were tainted with two capital errors: they assumed,\r\nin fact, that the catastrophe of the 20th of March had been the result\r\nof a widely-spread conspiracy, the authors of which ought to be punished\r\nas they would have been in ordinary times, and by the regular course of\r\nlaw, if they had miscarried; they assigned to the Chambers the right of\r\nindicating, by general categories, and without limit as to number, the\r\nconspirators to be thus dealt with, although the King, by his decree of\r\nthe 24th of July preceding, had merely conferred on them the power of\r\ndeciding, amongst the thirty-eight individuals specially excepted by\r\nname, which should be banished and which should be brought to trial.\r\nThere was thus, in these projects, at the same time, an act of\r\naccusation under the name of amnesty, and an invasion of the powers\r\nalready exercised, as well as of the limits already imposed, by the\r\nroyal authority.\r\n\r\nThe King's Government by no means mistook the bearing of such\r\nresolutions, and maintained its rights, its acts, and promises with\r\nsuitable dignity. It hastened to check at once the attempt of the\r\nChamber. The bill introduced by the Duke de Richelieu on the 8th of\r\nDecember, was a real act of amnesty, with no other exceptions than the\r\nfifty-six persons named in the two lists of the decree of the 24th of\r\nJuly, and belonging to the family of the Emperor Napoleon. A single\r\nadditional clause, the fatal consequences of which were assuredly not\r\nforeseen, had been introduced into the preamble: the fifth article\r\nexcepted from the amnesty all persons against whom prosecutions had been\r\nordered or sentences passed before the promulgation of the law,--a\r\nlamentable reservation, equally contrary to the principle of the measure\r\nand the object of its framers. The character and essential value of an\r\namnesty consist in assigning a term to trials and punishments, in\r\narresting judicial action in the name of political interest, and in\r\nre-establishing confidence in the public mind, with security in the\r\nexisting state of things, at once producing a cessation of sanguinary\r\nscenes and dangers. The King's Government had already, by the first list\r\nof exceptions in the decree of the 24th of July, imposed on itself a\r\nheavy burden. Eighteen generals had been sent before councils of war.\r\nEighteen grand political prosecutions, after the publication of the\r\namnesty, would have been much even for the strongest and\r\nbest-established government to bear. The Duke de Richelieu's Cabinet, by\r\nthe fifth article of the bill, imposed on itself, in addition, the\r\nprospective charge of an indefinite number of political prosecutions,\r\nwhich might rise up in an indefinite time; and no one could possibly\r\nforesee in what part of the kingdom, or under what circumstances. The\r\nevil of this short-sightedness continued, with repeated instances\r\nrapidly succeeding each other, for more than two years. It was the\r\nprolonged application of this article which destroyed the value and\r\nalmost the credit of the amnesty, and compromised the royal Government\r\nin that reaction of 1815 which has left such lamentable reminiscences.\r\n\r\nA member of the right-hand party, who was soon destined to become its\r\nleader, and who until then had taken no share in the debate,\r\nM. de Villele, alone foresaw the danger of the fifth article, and\r\nhesitated not to oppose it. \"This article,\" said he, \"seems to me too\r\nvague and expansive; exceptions to amnesty, after such a rebellion as\r\nthat which has taken place in our country, deliver over inevitably to\r\nthe rigour of the laws all the excepted individuals. Now rigorous\r\njustice demands that, in such cases, none should be excepted but the\r\nmost guilty and the most dangerous. Having no pledge or certain proof\r\nthat the individuals attainted by the fifth article have deserved this\r\nexpress exception, I vote that the article be struck out.\" Unfortunately\r\nfor the Government, this vote of the leader of the opposition passed\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question itself, this discussion produced an\r\nimportant result: it settled the division of the Chamber into two great\r\nparties, the right-hand side and the centre; the one the opponent, and\r\nthe other the ally of the Cabinet. The differences of opinion which\r\nmanifested themselves on this occasion were too keen, and were\r\nmaintained on both sides with too much animosity, not to become the\r\nbasis of a permanent classification. The right-hand party persisted in\r\nrequiring several categories of exceptions to the amnesty, confiscations\r\nunder the name of indemnity for injuries done to the State, and the\r\nbanishment of the regicides who had been implicated during the Hundred\r\nDays. The centre, and the Cabinet in union, firmly resisted these\r\npropositions. M. Royer-Collard and M. de Serre, amongst others,\r\nexhibited in the course of this debate as much political intelligence\r\nas moral rectitude and impassioned eloquence. \"It is not always the\r\nnumber of executions that saves empires,\" said M. Royer-Collard; \"the\r\nart of governing men is more difficult, and glory is acquired at a\r\nloftier price. If we are prudent and skilful, we shall find that we have\r\npunished enough; never, if we are not so.\" M. de Serre applied himself\r\nchiefly to oppose the confiscations demanded under the title of\r\nindemnities. \"The revolutionists have acted thus,\" said he; \"they would\r\ndo the same again if they could recover power. It is precisely for this\r\nreason that you ought not to imitate their detestable example; and by a\r\ndistorted interpretation of an expression which is not open and sincere,\r\nby an artifice scarcely worthy of the theatre.... Gentlemen, our\r\ntreasury may be low, but let it be pure.\" The categories and the\r\nindemnities were definitively rejected. At the last moment, and in the\r\nmidst of almost universal silence, the banishment of the regicides was\r\nalone inscribed upon the act. Under the advice of his ministers, the\r\nKing felt that he could not, in obedience to the will of Louis XVI.,\r\nrefuse his sanction to the amnesty, and leave this formidable question\r\nin suspense. There are Divine judgments which human authority ought not\r\nto forestall; neither is it called upon to reject them when they are\r\ndeclared by the course of events.\r\n\r\nTo the differences on the questions of expediency, every day were added\r\nthe disagreements on the questions of principle. The Government itself\r\nexcited but few. A bill on elections, introduced by the Minister of the\r\nInterior, M. de Vaublanc, was the only one which assumed this\r\ncharacter. The debate was long and animated. The leading men on the\r\nopposite sides of the Chamber, MM. de Villele, de la Bourdonnaye,\r\nde Bonald, Royer-Collard, Pasquier, de Serre, Beugnot, and Laine,\r\nentered into it anxiously. But the ministerial plan was badly conceived,\r\nbased upon incompatible foundations, and giving to the elections more of\r\nan administrative than of a political character. The principal orators\r\nof the Centre rejected it, as well as a counter-project proposed by the\r\ncommittee, in which the right-hand party prevailed, and which the\r\nCabinet also disapproved. The last proposal was ultimately carried, but\r\nwith important amendments, and vehemently opposed to the last. The\r\nChamber of Deputies passed it by a weak majority, and in the Chamber of\r\nPeers it was thrown out. Although the different parties had clearly\r\nindicated their impressions and desires on the electoral system, the\r\ndetails were as yet obscure and unsettled. The question remained in\r\nabeyance. From the Chamber itself emanated the other propositions which\r\ninvolved matters of principle; they sprang from the right-hand party,\r\nand all tended to the same point--the position of the Church in the\r\nState. M. de Castelbajac proposed that the bishops and ministers should\r\nbe authorized to receive and hold in perpetuity, without requiring the\r\nsanction of Government, all donations of property, real or personal, for\r\nthe maintenance of public worship or ecclesiastical establishments.\r\nM. de Blangy demanded that the condition of the clergy should be\r\nmaterially improved, and that the married priests should no longer enjoy\r\nthe pensions which had been given to them in their clerical character.\r\nM. de Bonald called for the abolition of the law of divorce.\r\nM. Lacheze-Murel insisted that the custody of the civil records should\r\nbe given back to the ministers of religion. M. Murard de St. Romain\r\nattacked the University, and argued that public education should be\r\nconfided to the clergy. The zeal of the new legislators was, above all\r\nother considerations, directed towards the re-establishment of religion\r\nand the Church, as the true basis of social power.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the uneasiness and opposition excited by these proposals\r\nwere less animated than we can at present imagine. More immediate\r\ndangers occupied the adversaries of Government and the public mind. A\r\ngeneral sentiment in favour of religion as a necessary principle of\r\norder and morality, prevailed throughout the country; a sentiment\r\nrevived even by the crisis of the Hundred Days, the moral wounds which\r\nthat crisis had revealed, and the social dangers it had partially\r\ndisclosed. The Catholic Church had not yet become the mark of the\r\nreaction which a little later was raised against it. The clergy took no\r\ndirect part in these debates. The University had been, under the Empire,\r\nan object of suspicion and hostility on the part of the Liberals. The\r\nmovement in favour of religious influences scarcely astonished those\r\nwhom it displeased. But in the very bosom of the Chamber whence this\r\nmovement emanated, there were enlightened understandings, who at once\r\nperceived its full range, and I foresaw the angry dissensions which\r\nsooner or later would be stirred up in the new social system by some of\r\nthese propositions, so utterly opposed to its most fundamental and\r\ncherished principles. They applied themselves, with resolute good\r\nsense, to extract from the measures introduced, a selection conformable\r\nto the true interests of society and the Church. The law of divorce was\r\nabolished. The position of the parish priests, of the assistant\r\nministers, and of several ecclesiastical establishments received\r\nimportant amelioration. The scandal of married clergymen still receiving\r\nofficial pensions ceased. But the proposal of assigning to the clergy\r\nthe care of the civil records, and the control of public instruction,\r\nfell to the ground. The University, well defended and directed by\r\nM. Royer-Collard, remained intact. And with regard to the privilege\r\ndemanded for the clergy, of receiving every kind of donation without the\r\ninterference of the civil authorities, the Chamber of Peers, on a\r\nreport, as judicious as it was elegantly composed, by the\r\nAbbe de Montesquiou, reduced it to these conditions,--that none but\r\nreligious establishments recognized by law should exercise this right,\r\nand that in every individual instance the authority of the King should\r\nbe indispensable. The Chamber of Deputies adopted the measure thus\r\namended, and from this movement, which threatened to disturb so\r\ncompletely the relations of the Church and State, nothing eventuated to\r\ninfringe seriously either on the old maxims or the modern principles of\r\nFrench society.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet co-operated loyally in these debates and wise resolutions,\r\nbut with less decision and ascendency than that evinced by the moderate\r\nRoyalists in the Chambers. It brought into the question neither the\r\ndepth of thought, nor the power of eloquence, which give a Government\r\nthe control over legislative assemblies, and raise it, even in spite of\r\nits deficiencies, in public estimation. The Duke de Richelieu was\r\nuniversally respected. Amongst his colleagues, all men of high character\r\nand loyalty, there were several who were endowed with rare knowledge,\r\nability, and courage. But the Cabinet wanted unity and brilliant\r\nreputation; important conditions under any system, but pre-eminently so\r\nunder a free government.\r\n\r\nOutside the Chambers, the Ministry had to sustain a still more weighty\r\nload than the pressure from within, and one which they were not better\r\nable to encounter. France had become a prey, not to the most tyrannical\r\nor the most sanguinary, but to the most vexatious and irritating of all\r\nthe passing influences which the vicissitudes of frequent revolutions\r\nimpose upon a nation. A party long vanquished, trampled on, and finally\r\nincluded in a general amnesty, the party of the old Royalty, suddenly\r\nimagined that they had become masters, and gave themselves up\r\npassionately to the enjoyment of a new power which they looked upon as\r\nan ancient right. God forbid that I should revive the sad remembrances\r\nof this reaction! I only desire to explain its true character. It was,\r\nin civil society, in internal administration, in local affairs, and\r\nnearly throughout the entire land of France, a species of foreign\r\ninvasion, violent in certain places, offensive everywhere, and which\r\noccasioned more evil to be dreaded than it actually inflicted; for these\r\nunexpected victors threatened and insulted even where they refrained\r\nfrom striking. They seemed inclined to indemnify themselves by arrogant\r\ntemerity, for their impotence to recover all that they had lost; and to\r\nsatisfy their own consciences in the midst of their revenge, they tried\r\nto persuade themselves that they were far from inflicting on their\r\nenemies the full measure of what they had themselves suffered.\r\n\r\nStrangers to the passions of this party, impressed with the mischief\r\nthey inflicted on the Royal cause, and personally wounded by the\r\nembarrassments they occasioned to the Government, the Duke de Richelieu\r\nand the majority of his colleagues contended with honest sincerity\r\nagainst them. Even by the side of the most justly condemned proceedings\r\nduring the reaction of 1815, and which remained entirely unpunished, we\r\nfind traces of the efforts of the existing authorities either to check\r\nthem, prevent their return, or at least to repel the sad responsibility\r\nof permitting them. When the outrages against the Protestants broke out\r\nin the departments of the south, and more than six weeks before\r\nM. d'Argenson spoke of them in the Chamber of Deputies, a royal\r\nproclamation, countersigned by M. Pasquier, vehemently denounced them,\r\nand called upon the magistrates for their suppression. After the\r\nscandalous acquittal, by the Court of Assize at Nismes, of the assassin\r\nof General Lagarde, who had protected the free worship of the\r\nProtestants, M. Pasquier demanded and obtained, from the Court of\r\nAppeal, the annulment of this sentence, in the name of the law, and as a\r\nlast protestation of discarded justice. In spite of every possible\r\nintervention of delay and impediment, the proceedings commenced at\r\nToulouse, and ended in a decree of the prevotal court at Pau, which\r\ninflicted five years' imprisonment on two of the murderers of General\r\nRamel. Those of Marshal Brune had never been seriously pursued; but\r\nM. de Serre, being appointed Chancellor, compelled justice to resume its\r\ncourse; and the Court of Assize at Riom condemned to death, in default\r\nof appearance, the assassins they were unable to apprehend. Tardy and\r\ninsufficient amends, which reveal the weakness of authority, as well as\r\nthe resistance with which it was opposed! Even the ministers most\r\nsubservient to the extreme royalist party endeavoured to check while\r\nsupporting them, and took care to contribute less assistance than they\r\nhad promised. At the very time when the Government divided the old army\r\ninto classes, to get rid of all the suspected officers, the Minister of\r\nWar, the Duke of Feltri, summoned to the direction of the staff of his\r\ndepartment General de Meulan, my brother-in-law, a brave soldier, who\r\nhad entered the service as a private in 1797, and had won his promotion\r\non the field of battle by dint of wounds. M. de Meulan was a royalist,\r\nbut extremely attached to the army and his comrades, and deeply grieved\r\nby the severities with which they were oppressed. I witnessed his\r\nconstant efforts to obtain justice for them, and to secure the\r\ncontinuance in the ranks, or re-admission, of all those whom he believed\r\nto be disposed to serve the King with honest loyalty. The undertaking\r\nwas difficult. In 1816, one of our most able and distinguished officers\r\nof engineers, General Bernard, had been placed on half-pay, and lived in\r\nexile at Dole. The United States of America offered him the command of\r\nthat branch of service in the Republic, with considerable advantages. He\r\naccepted the proposal, and asked the permission of his minister. The\r\nDuke of Feltri summoned him to his presence, and tried to induce him to\r\nabandon this design, by offering to appoint him to any situation in\r\nFrance which he considered suitable. \"You promise me,\" said Bernard,\r\n\"what you are unable to perform; place me as you intend, and in a\r\nfortnight I shall be so denounced that you will have no power to support\r\nme, and so harassed that I should voluntarily resign. While the\r\nGovernment has no more strength than at present, it can neither employ\r\nnor protect me. In my corner, I am at the mercy of a sub-prefect and\r\npolice magistrate, who can arrest and imprison me; who sends for me\r\nevery day, and compels me to wait in his ante-chamber to be ill received\r\nat last. Suffer me to go to America. The United States are the natural\r\nallies of France. I have decided, and, unless imprisoned, I shall\r\ncertainly take my departure.\" His passport was then given to him. The\r\nDuke de Berry complained to General Haxo of the course adopted by\r\nGeneral Bernard. \"After the manner in which he has been treated,\"\r\nreplied Haxo, \"I am only surprised that he has not gone before; it is by\r\nno means certain that I shall not some day follow his example.\"\r\n\r\nNothing can explain, better than this simple fact, the situation of the\r\nKing's ministers at that time, and the sincerity as well as the timidity\r\nof their wishes to be prudent and just.\r\n\r\nA great act, resolutely conceived and accomplished, on a great occasion,\r\nwas necessary to raise the executive authority from the reputation as\r\nwell as the actual mischief of this weakness, and to emancipate it from\r\nthe party under which it succumbed while resisting. Today, so long\r\nremoved as we are from that time, the more I reflect on it in the calm\r\nfreedom of my judgment, the more I am convinced that the trial of\r\nMarshal Ney afforded a most propitious opportunity for such an act as\r\nthat to which I now allude. There were undoubtedly weighty reasons for\r\nleaving justice to its unfettered course. Society and the royal power\r\nboth required that respect for, and a salutary dread of, the law should\r\nrepossess men's minds. It was important that generations formed during\r\nthe vicissitudes of the Revolution and the triumphs of the Empire,\r\nshould learn, by startling examples, that all does not depend on the\r\nstrength and success of the moment; that there are certain inviolable\r\nduties; that we cannot safely sport with the fate of governments and the\r\npeace of nations; and that, in this momentous game, the most powerful\r\nand the most eminent risk their honour and their lives. In a political\r\nand moral sense these considerations were of the greatest importance.\r\nBut another prominent truth, equally moral and political, ought to have\r\nweighed heavily in the balance against an extreme decision. The Emperor\r\nNapoleon had reigned long and brilliantly, acknowledged and admired by\r\nFrance and Europe, and supported by the devotion of millions of men,--by\r\nthe people as well as by the army. Ideas of right and duty, sentiments\r\nof respect and fidelity, were confused and antagonistic in many minds.\r\nThere were two actual and natural governments in presence of each other;\r\nand many, without perversity, might have hesitated which to choose. The\r\nKing, Louis XVIII. and his advisers might in their turn, without\r\nweakness, have taken into consideration this moral confusion, of which\r\nMarshal Ney presented the most illustrious example. The greater his\r\noffence against the King, with the more safety could they place clemency\r\nby the side of justice, and display, over his condemned head, that\r\ngreatness of mind and heart which has also its full influence in\r\nestablishing power and commanding fidelity. The very violence of the\r\nreaction in favour of royalty, the bitterness of party passions, their\r\nthirst for punishment and vengeance, would have imparted to this act a\r\nstill greater brilliancy of credit and effect; for boldness and liberty\r\nwould have sprung from it as natural consequences. I heard at that\r\ntime a lady of fashion, usually rational and amiable, call\r\nMademoiselle de Lavalette \"a little wretch,\" for aiding her mother in\r\nthe escape of her father. When such extravagancies of feeling and\r\nlanguage are indulged in the hearing of kings and their advisers, they\r\nshould be received as warnings to resist, and not to submit.\r\nMarshal Ney, pardoned and banished after condemnation, by royal letters\r\ndeliberately promulgated, would have given to kingly power the aspect of\r\na rampart raising itself above all, whether friends or enemies, to stay\r\nthe tide of blood; it would have been, in fact, the reaction of 1815\r\nsubdued and extinguished, as well as that of the Hundred Days.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to have thought and said then, all that I say and think\r\nat present. I was sorrowful and perplexed. The King's ministers were in\r\na similar predicament. They believed that they neither could nor ought\r\nto recommend clemency. In this momentous contingency, power knew not how\r\nto be great, sometimes the only method of becoming strong. Controlled\r\nbut not overthrown, and irritated while defeated, by these alternations\r\nof concession and resistance, the Right-hand party, now become decidedly\r\nthe Opposition, sought, while complaining and hesitating, some channel\r\nof escape from their position at once powerful and impotent,--some\r\nbreach through which they might give the assault to the Government,\r\nenter the citadel, and establish themselves firmly there. A man of mind\r\nand courage, ambitious, restless, clever, and discontented, as well on\r\nhis own account as for the sake of his party, ventured an attack\r\nextremely daring in reality, but circumspect in form, and purely\r\ntheoretical in appearance. M. de Vitrolles, in a short pamphlet entitled\r\n'Of the Ministry under a Representative Government,' said:--\"France in\r\nevery quarter expresses the necessity, profoundly acknowledged, of\r\nsterner action in the Government. I have examined the causes of this\r\nuniversal feeling, and the reasons which could explain why the different\r\nAdministrations that have succeeded each other within the last eighteen\r\nmonths have not given the King's Cabinet the character of strength and\r\nunity which the Ministers themselves feel to be so essential. I believe\r\nthat I have found them in the incoherence which existed between the\r\nnature of the adopted government and the ministerial organization, which\r\nit had not been considered necessary to modify, while at the same time\r\nwe received a new division of power, and that power assumed an entirely\r\nnew character of action.\" Appealing at every sentence to the practice\r\nand example of England, M. de Vitrolles argued that the Ministry, which\r\nhe called _an institution_, should have perfect unity in itself, a\r\npredominant majority in the Chambers, and an actual responsibility in\r\nthe conduct of affairs, which would ensure for it, with the Crown, the\r\nrequisite influence and dignity. On these three conditions alone could\r\nthe Government be effective. A strange reminiscence to refer to at the\r\npresent day! By the most confidential intimate of the Count d'Artois,\r\nand to establish the old royalist party in power, parliamentary\r\nlegislation was for the first time recommended and demanded for France,\r\nas a necessary consequence of representative government.\r\n\r\nI undertook to repulse this attack by unmasking it.[11] I explained, in\r\nreply, the essential principles of representative government, their true\r\nmeaning, their real application, and the conditions under which they\r\ncould be usefully developed, in the state in which France had been\r\nplunged by our revolutions and dissensions. Above all, I endeavoured to\r\nexpose the bitterness of party spirit which lay behind this polished and\r\nerudite tilting-match between political rhetoricians, and the underhand\r\nblows which, in the insufficiency of their public weapons, they secretly\r\naimed at each other. I believe my ideas were sound enough to satisfy\r\nintelligent minds who looked below the surface and onwards to the\r\nfuture; but they had no immediate and practical efficacy. When the great\r\ninterests of nations and the contending passions of men are at stake,\r\nthe most ingenious speculative arguments are a mere war of display,\r\nwhich has no influence on the course of events. As soon as the budget\r\nwas voted, and on the very day of its announcement, the session was\r\nclosed, and the Chambers of 1815 retired, having strenuously exercised,\r\nboth in defence and attack, the free privileges conferred on France by\r\nthe Charter; but divided into two Royalist parties: the one wavering and\r\nuneasy, although in the possession of power; the other full of\r\nexpectation, and looking forward, with the opening of the next session,\r\nto a more decisive success, and both in a state of mutual irritation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their doubts and weaknesses, the advantage remained with\r\nthe Cabinet and its adherents. For the first time since France had been\r\na prey to the Revolution, the struggles of liberty assisted the\r\nadvocates of a moderate policy, and essentially checked, if not\r\ncompletely subdued, their opponents. The waves of reaction murmured, but\r\nrose no more. The Cabinet, strongly supported in the Chambers, possessed\r\nthe confidence of the King, who entertained a high esteem for the Duke\r\nde Richelieu, and a friendly disposition, becoming daily more warm,\r\ntowards his young Minister of Police, M. Decazes. Eight days after the\r\nclosing of the session, the Cabinet gained an important accession to its\r\ninternal strength, and an eloquent interpreter of its public policy.\r\nM. Laine replaced M. de Vaublanc as Minister of the Interior. As a slight\r\ncompensation to the right-hand party, M. de Marbois, who had rendered\r\nhimself very objectionable to them, was dismissed from the Ministry of\r\nJustice, and the Chancellor, M. Dambray, resumed the seals.\r\nM. de Marbois was one of those upright and well-informed men, but at the\r\nsame time neither quick-sighted nor commanding, who assist power by\r\nopinion rather than force. He had opposed the reaction with more\r\nintegrity than energy, and served the King with dignity, without\r\nacquiring personal influence. In October 1815, at a moment of the most\r\nviolent agitation, the King expressed much anxiety for the introduction\r\nof the bill respecting the prevotal courts. It was settled in council\r\nthat the Chancellor and the Minister of War should prepare it together.\r\nA few days after, the King asked for it rather impatiently. \"Sire,\"\r\nanswered M. de Marbois, \"I am ashamed to tell your Majesty that it is\r\nready.\" He resigned office honourably, although with some regret. At the\r\nsame time I left the post of Secretary-General to the Ministry of\r\nJustice. While there, M. de Marbois had treated me with confidence\r\ninspired by sympathy. Finding it disagreeable to remain under\r\nM. Dambray, to whom my Protestant extraction and opinions were equally\r\nunsuited, I re-assumed the place of Master of Requests in the State\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe Chambers had scarcely adjourned, when the conspiracy of Grenoble,\r\nplanned by Didier, and that called the plot of the patriots, at Paris,\r\nin 1816, came, one upon the other, to put the moderation of the Cabinet\r\nto the proof. The details forwarded by the magistrates of the department\r\nof the Isere were full of exaggeration and declamatory excitement. The\r\nmode of repression ordered by the Government was precipitately rigorous.\r\nGrenoble had been the cradle of the Hundred Days. It was thought\r\nexpedient to strike Bonapartism heavily, in the very place where it had\r\nfirst exploded. A natural opportunity presented itself here of dealing\r\nfirmly with the abettors of treason, while in another quarter strong\r\nresistance was opposed to the advocates of reaction. Moderation\r\nsometimes becomes impatient of its name, and yields to the temptation of\r\nforgetting it for the moment.\r\n\r\nThe Government nevertheless continued to be moderate, and the public\r\nwere not deceived as to the course adopted. Although M. Decazes, from\r\nthe nature of his department, was the minister on whom measures of\r\ninquiry and suppression devolved, he was at the same time looked upon,\r\nand truly, as the protector of the oppressed, and of all who were\r\nsuspected without cause. By natural disposition and magisterial habit,\r\nhe loved justice in his heart. A stranger to all party antipathies,\r\npenetrating, fearless, indefatigably active, and as prompt in\r\nbenevolence as in duty, he exercised the power which the special laws\r\nconferred on him with measure and discretion; enforcing them as much\r\nagainst the spirit of reaction and persecution as against detected\r\nconspiracy, and continually occupied himself in preventing or repairing\r\nthe abuses in which the inferior authorities indulged. Thus he advanced\r\nequally in the good opinion of the country and the favour of the King.\r\nPeople and parties have an infallible instinct by which they recognize,\r\nunder the most complicated circumstances, those who attack and those who\r\ndefend them, their friends and their enemies. The ultra-royalists soon\r\nbegan to look upon M. Decazes as their chief adversary, and the\r\nmoderates to regard him as their most valuable ally.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, and during the silence of the tribune, the chief\r\nrepresentatives of moderate policy in the Chambers eagerly sought\r\nopportunities of bringing their views before the public, of proclaiming\r\ntheir principles, and of rallying, round the King and the constitutional\r\ngovernment, the still hesitating support of the nation at large. It\r\naffords me much gratification to recall here the words, perhaps\r\nforgotten, of three justly celebrated men, all personal friends of my\r\nown; they demonstrate (as I think, with some brilliancy) the spirit of\r\nthe monarchical party attached to the state of society which the times\r\nhad engendered in France, and the opinions and sentiments they were\r\nanxious to disseminate.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of July, 1816, M. de Serre, in establishing, as first\r\nPresident, the Royal Court at Colmar, spoke as follows:--\"Liberty, that\r\npretext of all seditious ambition,--liberty, which is nothing more than\r\nthe reign of law, has ever been the first privilege buried with the laws\r\nunder the ruins of the throne. Religion itself is in danger when the\r\nthrone and laws are attacked; for everything on earth is derived from\r\nheaven, and there is perfect harmony between all divine and human\r\ninstitutions. If the latter are overturned, the former cannot be\r\nrespected. Let all our efforts, then, be exerted to combine, purify, and\r\nstrengthen that monarchical and Christian spirit which inspires the\r\nsentiment of every sacrifice to duty! Let our first care be to obtain\r\nuniversal respect for the Charter which the King has granted to us.\r\nUndoubtedly our laws, our Charter, may be improved; and we neither\r\nrequire to interdict regret for the past nor hope for the future. But\r\nlet us commence by submitting heartily and without reserve to the laws\r\nas they exist; let us place this first check on the impatient\r\nrestlessness to which we have been surrendered for twenty-five years;\r\nlet us teach ourselves this primary conviction, that we know how to\r\nadopt and to be satisfied with a defined system. The rest may be left to\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nSix weeks later, on the 19th of August, M. Royer-Collard, when presiding\r\nover the distribution of prizes at the general meeting of the\r\nUniversity, addressed these words to the young students:--\"Today, when\r\nthe reign of falsehood has ceased, and the legitimacy of power, which is\r\ntruth in government, permits a more unshackled play to all salutary and\r\ngenerous doctrines, public instruction beholds its destinies elevated\r\nand expanded. Religion demands from it pure hearts and disciplined\r\nminds; the State looks for habits profoundly monarchical; science,\r\nphilosophy, and literature expect new brilliancy and distinction. These\r\nwill be the benefits bestowed by a prince to whom his people already owe\r\nso much gratitude and love. He, who has made public liberty flourish\r\nunder the shadow of his hereditary throne, will know well how to base,\r\non the tutelary principles of empires, a system of teaching worthy of\r\nthe enlightened knowledge of the age, and such as France demands from\r\nhim, that she may not descend from the glorious rank she occupies\r\namongst nations.\"\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of eight days more, in an assembly exclusively\r\nliterary, a man who had never held public office, but for half or more\r\nthan half a century a sincere and steady friend to liberty, M. Suard,\r\nperpetual secretary of the French Academy, in giving an account to that\r\nbody of the examination in which he had decreed the prize to\r\nM. Villemain for his 'Panegyric on Montesquieu,' expressed himself in\r\nthese terms:--\"The instability of governments generally proceeds from\r\nindecision as to the principles which ought to regulate the exercise of\r\npower. A prince enlightened by the intelligence of the age, by\r\nexperience, and a superior understanding, bestows on royal authority a\r\nsupport which no other can replace, in that Charter which protects the\r\nrights of the monarch, while it guarantees to the nation all those that\r\nconstitute true and legitimate liberty. Let us rally under this signal\r\nof alliance between the people and their king. Their union is the only\r\ncertain pledge for the happiness of both. Let the Charter be for us what\r\nthe holy ark that contained the tables of the law was for the Hebrews of\r\nold. If the shade of the great publicist who has shed light on the\r\nprinciples of constitutional monarchies could be present at the triumph\r\nwhich we now award him, he would confirm with his sanction the\r\nsentiments I venture to express.\"\r\n\r\nAn assembly so unanimous in opinion and intention, composed of such men,\r\nrepresenting so many important sections of society, and voluntarily\r\ngrouped round the King and his ministers, constituted in themselves a\r\ngreat political fact. A certain index was supplied, that, in the opinion\r\nof the moderate party, enlightened minds were not wanting to comprehend\r\nthe conditions of the new system, or serious dispositions for its\r\nsupport. As yet, however, they only formed the scattered elements and\r\nseeds of a great conservative party under a free government. Time was\r\nnecessary for this party to unite, to consolidate its natural strength,\r\nand to render itself acceptable to the country. Would time be given for\r\nthis difficult undertaking? The question was doubtful. A formidable\r\ncrisis approached; the Chamber of 1815 was on the point of re-opening,\r\nand undoubtedly still more ardent and aggressive than during the\r\npreceding session. The party which prevailed there had not only to\r\nretrieve their checks, and pursue their designs, but they had also\r\nrecent insults to avenge. During the recess they had been the objects of\r\nanimated attack. The Government everywhere opposed their influence; the\r\npublic loudly manifested towards them mistrust and antipathy; they were\r\nalternately charged with fanaticism and hypocrisy, with incapacity and\r\nvindictive obstinacy. Popular-anger and ridicule assailed them with\r\nunrestrained license. From notes collected at the time, I quote\r\nliterally a few specimens of the sarcastic hostility with which they\r\nwere pursued:--\r\n\r\n\"April 10th, 1816.--Before adjourning, the Chamber of Deputies has\r\norganized itself into a chapel. Treasurer and secretary, M. Laborie.\r\nContractor for burials, M. de La Bourdonnaye. Grave-digger,\r\nM. Duplessis-Grenedan. Superintendent, M. de Bouville, and in his\r\ncapacity of vice-president--rattlesnake. Dispenser of holy water\r\n(promise-maker), M. de Vitrolles. General of the Capuchins,\r\nM. de Villele; and he deserves the post for his voice. Grand almoner,\r\nM. de Marcellus, who gives a portion of his own estate to the poor.\r\nBellringers, M. Hyde de Neuville,\" etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\"May, 1816.--Here is the Charter which a majority of the Chamber\r\nproposes to confer upon us.--_Article._ The fundamental principles of\r\nthe constitution may be changed as often as we wish; nevertheless,\r\nseeing that stability is desirable, they shall not be changed more than\r\nthree times a year.--_Art._ Every law emanates from the King; this is\r\nthe first evidence of the right of petition accorded to all\r\nfrenchmen.--_Art._ The laws shall be executed according to the pleasure\r\nof the Deputies, each in their respective departments.--_Art._ Every\r\nrepresentative shall have the nomination to all posts within his\r\ndistrict.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 1816.--They say the King is slightly indisposed. He will be very\r\nill indeed if he is obliged to keep his _Chamber_ for five years.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the public expressions respecting this assembly, one of the\r\nmost honourable members of which, M. de Kergorlay, said, a few months\r\nbefore, \"The Chamber had not yet whispered when the former Ministry\r\nalready fell; let it speak, and the present Government will scarcely\r\nlast eight days.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ministry, however, had held its ground, and still continued to do\r\nso; but it was evidently impossible that it could stand firm against the\r\nChamber, once more assembled with redoubled animosity. They well knew\r\nthat the Opposition was determined to renew the most violent attacks\r\nupon the existing authorities. M. de Chateaubriand printed his 'Monarchy\r\naccording to the Charter;' and although this able pamphlet was not yet\r\npublished, everybody knew the superior skill with which the author could\r\nso eloquently blend falsehood with truth, how brilliantly he could\r\ncompound sentiments and ideas, and with what power he could entangle the\r\nblinded and unsettled public in this dazzling chaos. Neither the\r\nMinistry nor the Opposition attempted to deceive themselves as to the\r\nnature and consequences of the struggle about to commence. The question\r\nof persons was merely the symbol and cloak of the great social and\r\npolitical topics in dispute between the two parties. The point to be\r\ndecided was, whether power should pass over to the _Right-hand_ party,\r\nsuch as it had exhibited itself during the session lately terminated;\r\nthat is, whether the theories of M. de Bonald and the passions of\r\nM. de La Bourdonnaye, feebly qualified by the prudence and influence, as\r\nyet unripened, of M. de Villele, should become the rule of the King's\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nI am not now, neither was I in 1815, amongst those who considered the\r\n_Right-hand_ party unfit to govern France. On the contrary, I had\r\nalready, although less profoundly and clearly than at present, adopted\r\nthe opinion, that a concurrence of all the enlightened and independent\r\nclasses, whether old or new, was absolutely necessary to rescue our\r\ncountry from the impending alternations of anarchy or despotism, and\r\nthat without their union we could never long preserve order and liberty\r\ntogether. Perhaps too I might include this natural tendency amongst the\r\nreasons, not absolutely defined, which led me to desire the Restoration.\r\nHereditary monarchy, become constitutional, presented itself to my mind\r\nboth as a principle of stability, and as a natural and worthy means of\r\nreconciliation and conversion amongst the classes and parties who had\r\nbeen so long and continually at war. But in 1816, so soon after the\r\nrevolutionary shock of the Hundred Days, and before the\r\ncounter-revolutionary reaction of 1815 had subsided, the accession of\r\nthe _Right-hand_ party to power, would have been very different from the\r\nvictory of men capable of governing without social disturbance, although\r\nunder an unpopular system. It would have been the Revolution and the\r\nCounter-revolution once more in active contest, under an attack of\r\nraging fever; and thus the Throne and the Charter, the internal peace\r\nand security of France as well as her liberties, would be endangered by\r\nthis struggle, before the eyes of Europe encamped within our territory\r\nand in arms around the combatants.\r\n\r\nUnder these menacing circumstances, M. Decazes had the rare merit of\r\nfinding and applying a remedy to the gigantic evil. He was the first,\r\nand for some time the only one amongst the Ministers, who looked upon\r\nthe dissolution of the Chamber of 1815 as equally necessary and\r\npossible. Undoubtedly personal interest had a share in his bold\r\nperspicuity; but I know him well enough to feel convinced, that his\r\ndevotion to the country and the King powerfully contributed to his\r\nenlightened decision; and his conduct at this crisis displayed at least\r\nas much patriotism as ambition.\r\n\r\nHe had a double labour of persuasion to accomplish; first to win over\r\nhis two principal colleagues, the Duke de Richelieu and M. Laine, and\r\nafterwards the King himself. Both sincerely attached to a moderate\r\npolicy, the Duke and M. Laine were undecided, timid under great\r\nresponsibility, and more disposed to wait the progress of difficulties\r\nand dangers, than to surmount by confronting them. Amongst the Duke's\r\nimmediate circle were many ultra-royalists, who exercised no influence\r\nover him, and whom he even treated rudely when they displayed their\r\nviolence; but he was unwilling to declare open war against them.\r\nM. Laine, scrupulous in his resolves and fearful for their consequences,\r\nwas sensitive on the point of vanity, and disinclined to any measure not\r\noriginating with himself.[12] The King's irresolution was perfectly\r\nnatural. How could he dissolve the first Chamber, avowedly royalist,\r\nwhich had been assembled for twenty-five years,--a Chamber he had\r\nhimself declared incomparable, and which contained so many of his oldest\r\nand most faithful friends? What dangers to himself and his dynasty might\r\nspring up on the day of such a decree! and even now, what discontent and\r\nanger already existed in his family and amongst his devoted adherents,\r\nand consequently what embarrassment and vexation thereby recoiled upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut Louis XVIII. had a cold heart and an unfettered mind. The rage and\r\nill-temper of his relatives affected him little, when he had once firmly\r\nresolved not to be influenced by them. It was his pride and pleasure to\r\nfancy himself a more enlightened politician than all the rest of his\r\nrace, and to act in perfect independence of thought and will. On more\r\nthan one occasion, the Chamber, if not in direct words, at least in act\r\nand manner, had treated him with disrespect almost amounting to\r\ncontempt, after the fashion of a revolutionary assembly. It became\r\nnecessary for him to show to all, that he would not endure the display\r\nof such feelings and principles either from his friends or enemies. He\r\nregarded the Charter as his own work, and the foundation of his glory.\r\nThe right-hand party frequently insulted and sometimes threatened a\r\ndirect attack upon the Charter. The defence lay with the King. This gave\r\nhim an opportunity of re-establishing it in its original integrity.\r\nDuring the administration of M. de Talleyrand he had, reluctantly and\r\nagainst his own conviction, modified several articles, and submitted\r\nfourteen others to the revision of the legislative authorities. To cut\r\nshort this revision, and to return to the pure Charter, was to restore\r\nit a second time to France, and thus to establish, for the country and\r\nhimself, a new pledge of security and peace.\r\n\r\nDuring more than two months, M. Decazes handled all these points with\r\nmuch ability and address; determined, but not impatient, persevering,\r\nyet not obstinate, changing his topic according to the tempers he\r\nencountered, and day by day bringing before these wavering minds the\r\nfacts and arguments best adapted to convince them. Without taking his\r\nprincipal friends unconnected with the Cabinet into the full and daily\r\nconfidence of his labours, he induced them, under a promise of secrecy,\r\nto assist him by reasons and reflections which he might bring under the\r\neyes of the King, while they gave variety to his own views. Several\r\namongst them transmitted notes to him with this object; I contributed\r\none also, particularly bearing on the hopes which those numerous middle\r\nclasses placed in the King, who desired no more than to enjoy the\r\nproductive repose they derived from him, and whom he alone could secure\r\nfrom the dangerous uncertainty to which the Chamber had reduced them.\r\nDifferent in origin and style, but all actuated by the same spirit and\r\ntending to the same end, these argumentative essays became gradually\r\nmore and more efficacious. Having at last decided, the Duke de Richelieu\r\nand M. Laine concurred with M. Decazes to bring over the King, who had\r\nalready formed his resolution, but chose to appear undecided, it being\r\nhis pleasure to have no real confidant but his favourite. The three\r\nministers who were known to be friends of the right-hand party,\r\nM. Dambray, the Duke of Feltri, and M. Dubouchage, were not consulted;\r\nand it was said that they remained in total ignorance of the whole\r\naffair to the last moment. I have reason to believe that, either from\r\nrespect to the King, or from reluctance to enter into contest with the\r\nfavourite, they soon reconciled themselves to a result which they plainly\r\nforesaw.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, on Wednesday, the 14th of August, the King held a\r\ncabinet council; the sitting was over, and the Duke of Feltri had\r\nalready risen to take his departure. The King desired him to resume his\r\nplace again. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"there is yet a question of immediate\r\nurgency,--the course to be taken with respect to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. Three months ago I had determined to re-assemble it. Even a\r\nmonth since, I retained the same intention; but all that I have seen,\r\nand all that comes under my daily observation, proves so clearly the\r\nspirit of faction by which that Chamber is governed, the dangers which\r\nit threatens to France and to myself have become so apparent, that I\r\nhave entirely changed my opinion. From this moment, then, you may\r\nconsider the Chamber as dissolved. Start from that point, gentlemen,\r\nprepare to execute the measure, and in the meantime preserve the most\r\ninviolable secrecy on the subject. My decision is absolute.\" When Louis\r\nXVIII. had formed a serious resolution and intended to be obeyed, he had\r\na tone of dignity and command which cut short all remonstrance. During\r\nthree weeks, although the question deeply occupied all minds, and in\r\nspite of some returns of hesitation on the part of the King himself, the\r\nsecret of the resolution adopted was so profoundly kept, that the Court\r\nbelieved the Chamber would re-assemble. It was only on the 5th of\r\nSeptember, after the King had retired to bed, that _Monsieur_ received\r\ninformation through the Duke de Richelieu, from his Majesty, that the\r\ndecree for the dissolution was signed, and would be published in the\r\n'Moniteur' on the following morning.\r\n\r\nThe surprise and anger of _Monsieur_ were unbounded; he would have\r\nhastened at once to the King; the Duke de Richelieu withheld him, by\r\nsaying that the King was already asleep, and had given peremptory orders\r\nthat he should not be disturbed. The Princes, his sons, accustomed to\r\nextreme reserve in the King's presence, appeared to approve rather than\r\ncondemn. \"The King has acted wisely,\" said the Duke de Berry; \"I warned\r\nthose gentlemen of the Chamber that they had indulged in too much\r\nlicense.\" The Court was thrown into consternation, on hearing of a\r\nstroke so totally unexpected. The party against whom it was aimed,\r\nattempted some stir in the first instance. M. de Chateaubriand added an\r\nangry _Postscript_ to his 'Monarchy according to the Charter,' and\r\nevinced symptoms of resistance, more indignant than rational, to the\r\nmeasures decreed, in consequence of some infraction of the regulations\r\nof the press, to retard the publication of his work.[13] But the party,\r\nhaving reflected a little, prudently stifled their anger, and began\r\nimmediately to contrive means for re-engaging in the contest. The\r\npublic, or, I ought rather to say, the entire land, loudly proclaimed\r\nits satisfaction. For honest, peaceably disposed people, the measure was\r\na signal of deliverance; for political agitators, a proclamation of\r\nhope. None were ignorant that M. Decazes had been its first and most\r\neffectual advocate. He was surrounded with congratulations, and promises\r\nthat all men of sense and substance would rally round him; he replied\r\nwith modest satisfaction, \"This country must be very sick indeed for me\r\nto be of so much importance.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: In a publication entitled 'Of Representative Government,\r\nand the Actual Condition of France,' published in 1816.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: I insert amongst the \"Historic Documents\" a note which he\r\ntransmitted to the King, in the course of the month of August, on the\r\nquestion of the dissolution of the Chamber; and in which the\r\nfluctuations and fantasies of his mind, more ingenious than judicious,\r\nare revealed.

This is the sour\r\nconsolation of the beaten, who feel the necessity of accounting for\r\ntheir defeat. Elections, taken comprehensively, are almost always more\r\ngenuine than interested and narrow-minded suspicion is disposed to\r\nallow. The desires and ability of the powers in office, exercise over\r\nthem only a secondary authority. The true essence of elections lies in\r\nthe way in which the wind blows, and in the impulse of passing events.\r\nThe decree of the 5th of September, 1816, had given confidence to the\r\nmoderate party, and a degree of hope to the persecuted of 1815. They all\r\nrallied round the Cabinet, casting aside their quarrels, antipathies,\r\nand private rancours, combining to support the power which promised\r\nvictory to the one and safety to the other.\r\n\r\nThe victory, in fact, remained with the Cabinet, but it was one of those\r\nquestionable triumphs which left the conquerors still engaged in a\r\nfierce war. The new Chamber comprised, in the centre a ministerial\r\nmajority, on the right a strong and active opposition, and on the left a\r\nvery small section, in which M. d'Argenson and M. Lafitte were the only\r\nnames recognized by the public.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial majority was formed from two different although at that\r\ntime closely-united elements,--the centre, properly called the grand\r\narmy of power, and the very limited staff of that army, who soon\r\nreceived the title of _doctrinarians_.\r\n\r\nI shall say of the centre of our assemblies since 1814, what I have just\r\nsaid of M. Cuvier; it has been misunderstood and calumniated, when\r\nservility and a rabid desire for place have been named as its leading\r\ncharacteristics. With it, as with others, personal interests have had\r\ntheir weight, and have looked for their gratification; but one general\r\nand just idea formed the spirit and bond of union of the party,--the\r\nidea that, in the present day, after so many revolutions, society\r\nrequired established government, and that to government all good\r\ncitizens were bound to render their support. Many excellent and\r\nhonourable sentiments,--family affection, a desire for regular\r\nemployment, respect for rank, laws, and traditions, anxieties for the\r\nfuture, religious habits,--all clustered round this conviction, and had\r\noften inspired its votaries with rare and trusting courage. I call these\r\npersevering supporters of Government, citizen Tories; their defamers are\r\nweak politicians and shallow philosophers, who neither understand the\r\nmoral instincts of the soul, nor the essential interests of society.\r\n\r\nThe _doctrinarians_ have been heavily attacked. I shall endeavour to\r\nexplain rather than defend them. When either men or parties have once\r\nexercised an influence over events, or obtained a place in history, it\r\nbecomes important that they should be correctly known; this point\r\naccomplished, they may rest in peace and submit to judgment.\r\n\r\nIt was neither intelligence, nor talent, nor moral dignity--qualities\r\nwhich their acknowledged enemies have scarcely denied them--that\r\nestablished the original character and political importance of the\r\n_doctrinarians_.\r\n\r\nOther men of other parties have possessed the same qualities; and\r\nbetween the relative pretensions of these rivals in understanding,\r\neloquence, and sincerity, public opinion will decide. The peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of the doctrinarians, and the real source of their\r\nimportance in spite of their limited number, was that they maintained,\r\nagainst revolutionary principles and ideas, ideas and principles\r\ncontrary to those of the old enemies of the Revolution, and with which\r\nthey opposed it, not to destroy but to reform and purify it in the name\r\nof justice and truth. The great feature, dearly purchased, of the French\r\nrevolution was, that it was a work of the human mind, its conceptions\r\nand pretensions, and at the same time a struggle between social\r\ninterests. Philosophy had boasted that it would regulate political\r\neconomy, and that institutions, laws, and public authorities should only\r\nexist as the creatures and servants of instructed reason,--- an insane\r\npride, but a startling homage to all that is most elevated in man, to\r\nhis intellectual and moral attributes! Reverses and errors were not slow\r\nin impressing on the Revolution their rough lessons; but even up to 1815\r\nit had encountered, as commentators on its ill-fortune, none but\r\nimplacable enemies or undeceived accomplices,--the first thirsting for\r\nvengeance, the last eager for rest, and neither capable of opposing to\r\nrevolutionary principles anything beyond a retrograde movement on the\r\none side, and the scepticism of weariness on the other. \"There was\r\nnothing in the Revolution but error and crime,\" said the first; \"the\r\nsupporters of the old system were in the right.\"--\"The Revolution erred\r\nonly in excess,\" exclaimed the second; \"its principles were sound, but\r\ncarried too far; it has abused its rights.\" The doctrinarians denied\r\nboth these conclusions; they refused to acknowledge the maxims of the\r\nold system, or, even in a mere speculative sense, to adhere to the\r\nprinciples of the Revolution. While frankly adopting the new state of\r\nFrench society, such as our entire history, and not alone the year 1789,\r\nhad made it, they undertook to establish a government on rational\r\nfoundations, but totally opposed to the theories in the name of which\r\nthe old system had been overthrown, or the incoherent principles which\r\nsome endeavoured to conjure up for its reconstruction. Alternately\r\ncalled on to combat and defend the Revolution, they boldly assumed from\r\nthe outset, an intellectual position, opposing ideas to ideas, and\r\nprinciples to principles, appealing at the same time to reason and\r\nexperience, affirming rights instead of maintaining interests, and\r\nrequiring France, not to confess that she had committed evil alone, or\r\nto declare her impotence for good, but to emerge from the chaos into\r\nwhich she had plunged herself, and to raise her head once more towards\r\nheaven in search of light.\r\n\r\nLet me readily admit that there was also much pride in this attempt; but\r\na pride commencing with an act of humility, which proclaims the mistakes\r\nof yesterday with the desire and hope of not repeating them today. It\r\nwas rendering homage to human intelligence while warning it of the\r\nlimits of its power, respecting the past, without undervaluing the\r\npresent or abandoning the future. It was an endeavour to bestow on\r\npolitics sound philosophy, not as a sovereign mistress, but as an\r\nadviser and support.\r\n\r\nI shall state without hesitation, according to what experience has\r\ntaught me, the faults which progressively mingled with this noble\r\ndesign, and impaired or checked its success. What I anxiously desire at\r\npresent is to indicate its true character. It was to this mixture of\r\nphilosophical sentiment and political moderation, to this rational\r\nrespect for opposing rights and facts, to these principles, equally new\r\nand conservative, anti-revolutionary without being retrograde, and\r\nmodest in fact although sometimes haughty in expression, that the\r\ndoctrinarians owed their importance as well as their name.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous errors of philosophy and human reason, the\r\npresent age still cherishes reasoning and philosophical tastes; and the\r\nmost determined practical politicians sometimes assume the air of acting\r\nupon general ideas, regarding them as sound methods of obtaining\r\njustification or credit. The doctrinarians thus responded to a profound\r\nand real necessity, although imperfectly acknowledged, of French minds:\r\nthey paid equal respect to intellect and social order; their notions\r\nappeared well suited to regenerate, while terminating the Revolution.\r\nUnder this double title they found, with partisans and adversaries,\r\npoints of contact which drew them together, if not with active sympathy,\r\nat least with solid esteem: the right-hand party looked upon them as\r\nsincere royalists; and the left, while opposing them with acrimony,\r\ncould not avoid admitting that they were neither the advocates of the\r\nold system, nor the defenders of absolute power.\r\n\r\nSuch was their position at the opening of the session of 1816: a little\r\nobscure still, but recognized by the Cabinet as well as by the different\r\nparties. The Duke de Richelieu, M. Laine, and M. Decazes, whether they\r\nliked the doctrinarians or not, felt that they positively required their\r\nco-operation, as well in the debates of the Chambers as to act upon\r\npublic opinion. The left-hand party, powerless in itself, accorded with\r\nthem from necessity, although their ideas and language sometimes\r\nproduced surprise rather than sympathy. The right, notwithstanding its\r\nlosses at the elections, was still very strong, and speedily assumed the\r\noffensive. The King's speech on opening the session was mild and\r\nsomewhat indistinct, as if tending rather to palliate the decree of the\r\n5th of September, than to parade it with an air of triumph: \"Rely,\" said\r\nhe, in conclusion, \"on my fixed determination to repress the outrages of\r\nthe ill-disposed, and to restrain the exuberance of overheated zeal.\"\r\n\"Is that all?\" observed M. de Chateaubriand, on leaving the royal\r\npresence; \"if so, the victory is ours:\" and on that same day he dined\r\nwith the Chancellor. M. de la Bourdonnaye was even more explicit. \"The\r\nKing,\" said he, with a coarse expression, \"once more hands his\r\nministers over to us!\" During the session of the next day, meeting\r\nM. Royer-Collard, with whom he was in the habit of extremely free\r\nconversation, \"Well,\" said he, \"there you are, more rogues than last\r\nyear.\" \"And you not so many,\" replied M. Royer-Collard. The right-hand\r\nparty, in their reviving hopes, well knew how to distinguish the\r\nadversaries with whom they would have to contend.\r\n\r\nAs in the preceding session, the first debates arose on questions of\r\nexpediency. The Cabinet judged it necessary to demand from the Chambers\r\nthe prolongation, for another year, of the two provisional laws\r\nrespecting personal liberty and the daily press. M. Decazes presented a\r\ndetailed account of the manner in which, up to that period, the\r\nGovernment had used the arbitrary power committed to its hands, and also\r\nthe new propositions which should restrain it within the limits\r\nnecessary to remove all apprehended danger. The right-hand party\r\nvigorously rejected these propositions, upon the very natural ground\r\nthat they had no confidence in the Ministers, but without any other\r\nreasoning than the usual commonplace arguments of liberalism. The\r\ndoctrinarians supported the bills, but with the addition of commentaries\r\nwhich strongly marked their independence, and the direction they wished\r\nto give to the power they defended. \"Every day,\" said M. de Serre, \"the\r\nnature of our constitution will be better understood, its benefits more\r\nappreciated by the nation; the laws with which you co-operate, will\r\nplace by degrees our institutions and habits in harmony with\r\nrepresentative monarchy; the government will approach its natural\r\nperfection,--that unity of principle, design, and action which forms the\r\ncondition of its existence. In permitting and even in protecting legal\r\nopposition, it will not allow that opposition to find resting-points\r\nwithin itself. It is because it can be, and ought to be, watched over\r\nand contradicted by independent men, that it should be punctually\r\nobeyed, faithfully seconded and served by those who have become and wish\r\nto remain its direct agents. Government will thus acquire a degree of\r\nstrength which can dispense with the employment of extraordinary means:\r\nlegal measures, restored to their proper energy, will be found\r\nsufficient.\" \"There is,\" said M. Royer-Collard, \"a strong objection\r\nagainst this bill; the Government may be asked, 'Before you demand\r\nexcessive powers, have you employed all those which the laws entrust to\r\nyou? have you exhausted their efficacy?' ... I shall not directly answer\r\nthis question, but I shall say to those who put it, 'Take care how you\r\nexpose your Government to too severe a trial, and one under which nearly\r\nall Governments have broken down; do not require from it perfection;\r\nconsider its difficulties as well as its duties.' ... We wish to arrest\r\nits steps in the course it pursues at present, and to impose daily\r\nchanges. We demand from it the complete development of institutions and\r\nconstitutional enactments; above all, we require that vigorous unity of\r\nprinciples, system, and conduct without which it will never effectually\r\nreach the end towards which it advances. But what it has already done,\r\nis a pledge for what it will yet accomplish. We feel a just reliance\r\nthat the extraordinary powers with which we invest it will be exercised,\r\nnot by or for a party, but for the nation against all parties. Such is\r\nour treaty; such are the stipulations which have been spoken of: they\r\nare as public as our confidence, and we thank those who have occasioned\r\ntheir repetition, for proving to France that we are faithful to her\r\ncause, and neglect neither her interests nor our own duties.\"\r\n\r\nWith a more gentle effusion of mind and heart, M. Camille Jordan held\r\nthe same language; the bills passed; the right-hand party felt as blows\r\ndirected against itself the advice suggested to the Cabinet, and the\r\nCabinet saw that in that quarter, as necessary supporters, they had also\r\nhaughty and exacting allies.\r\n\r\nTheir demands were not fruitless. The Cabinet, uninfluenced either by\r\ndespotic views or immoderate passions, had no desire to retain\r\nunnecessarily the absolute power with which it had been entrusted. No\r\neffort was requisite to deprive it of the provisional laws; they fell\r\nsuccessively of themselves,--the suspension of the securities for\r\npersonal liberty in 1817, the prevotal courts in 1818, the censorship of\r\nthe daily press in 1819; and four years after the tempest of the Hundred\r\nDays, the country was in the full enjoyment of all its constitutional\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, other questions, more and less important, were\r\nbrought forward and decided. When the first overflowing of the reaction\r\nof 1815 had a little calmed down, when France, less disturbed with the\r\npresent, began once more to think of the future, she was called upon to\r\nenter on the greatest work that can fall to the lot of a nation. There\r\nwas more than a new government to establish; it was necessary that a\r\nfree government should be imbued with vigour. It was written, and it\r\nmust live,--a promise often made, but never accomplished. How often,\r\nfrom 1789 to 1814, had liberties and political rights been inscribed on\r\nour institutes and laws, to be buried under them, and held of no\r\naccount. The first amongst the Governments of our day, the Restoration,\r\ntook these words at their true meaning; whatever may have been its\r\ntraditions and propensities, what it said, it did; the liberties and\r\nrights it acknowledged, were taken into real co-operation and action.\r\nFrom 1814 to 1830, as from 1830 to 1848, the Charter was a truth. For\r\nonce forgetting it, Charles X. fell.\r\n\r\nWhen this work of organization, or, to speak more correctly, when this\r\neffectual call to political life commenced in 1816, the question of the\r\nelectoral system, already touched upon, but without result, in the\r\npreceding session, was the first that came under notice. It was included\r\nin the scope of the fortieth article of the Charter, which ran\r\nthus:--\"The electors who nominate the Deputies can have no right of\r\nvoting, unless they pay a direct contribution of 300 francs, and have\r\nreached the age of thirty,\"--an ambiguous arrangement, which attempted\r\nmore than it ventured to accomplish. It evidently contained a desire of\r\nplacing the right of political suffrage above the popular masses, and of\r\nconfining it within the more elevated classes of society. But the\r\nconstitutional legislator had neither gone openly to this point, nor\r\nattained it with certainty; for if the Charter required from the\r\nelectors who were actually to name the Deputies, 300 francs of direct\r\ncontribution, and thirty years of age, it did not forbid that these\r\nelectors should be themselves chosen by preceding electoral assemblies;\r\nor rather it did not exclude indirect election, nor, under that form,\r\nwhat is understood by the term universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nI took part in drawing up the bill of the 5th of February, 1817, which\r\ncomprised, at that time, the solution given to this important question.\r\nI was present at the conferences in which it was prepared. When ready,\r\nM. Laine, whose business it was, as Minister of the Interior, to present\r\nit to the Chamber of Deputies, wrote to say that he wished to see me: \"I\r\nhave adopted,\" he said, \"all the principles of this bill, the\r\nconcentration of the right of suffrage, direct election, the equal\r\nprivilege of voters, their union in a single college for each\r\ndepartment; and I really believe these are the best that could be\r\ndesired: still, upon some of these points, I have mental doubts and\r\nlittle time to solve them. Help me in preparing the exposition of our\r\nobjects.\" I responded, as I was bound, to this confiding sincerity, by\r\nwhich I felt equally touched and honoured. The bill was brought in; and\r\nwhile my friends supported it in the Chamber, from whence my age for the\r\npresent excluded me, I defended it, on behalf of the Government, in\r\nseveral articles inserted in the 'Moniteur.' I was well informed as to\r\nits intent and true spirit, and I speak of it without embarrassment in\r\npresence of the universal suffrage, as now established. If the electoral\r\nsystem of 1817 disappeared in the tempest of 1848, it conferred on\r\nFrance thirty years of regular and free government, systematically\r\nsustained and controlled; and amidst all the varying influences of\r\nparties, and the shock of a revolution, this system sufficed to maintain\r\npeace, to develop national prosperity, and to preserve respect for all\r\nlegal rights. In this age of ephemeral and futile experiments, it is the\r\nonly political enactment which has enjoyed a long and powerful life. At\r\nleast it was a work which may be acknowledged, and which deserves to be\r\ncorrectly estimated, even after its overthrow.\r\n\r\nA ruling idea inspired the bill of the 5th of February, 1817,--to fix a\r\nterm to the revolutionary system, and to give vigour to the\r\nconstitutional Government. At that epoch, universal suffrage had ever\r\nbeen, in France, an instrument of destruction or deceit,--of\r\ndestruction, when it had really placed political power in the hands of\r\nthe multitude; of deceit, when it had assisted to annul political\r\nrights for the advantage of absolute power, by maintaining, through the\r\nvain intervention of the multitude, a false appearance of electoral\r\nprivilege. To escape, in fine, from that routine of alternate violence\r\nand falsehood, to place political power in the region within which the\r\nconservative interests of social order naturally predominate with\r\nenlightened independence, and to secure to those interests, by the\r\ndirect election of deputies from the country, a free and strong action\r\nupon its Government,--such were the objects, without reserve or\r\nexaggeration, of the authors of the electoral system of 1817.\r\n\r\nIn a country devoted for twenty-five years, on the subject of political\r\nelections, whether truly or apparently, to the principle of the\r\nsupremacy of number, so absurdly called the sovereignty of the people,\r\nthe attempt was new, and might appear rash. At first, it confined\r\npolitical power to the hands of 140,000 electors. From the public, and\r\neven from what was already designated the liberal party, it encountered\r\nbut slight opposition; some objections springing from the past, some\r\napprehensions for the future, but no declared or active hostility. It\r\nwas from the bosom of the classes specially devoted to conservative\r\ninterests, and from their intestine discussions, that the attack and the\r\ndanger emanated.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1815, the old royalist faction, in its moderated\r\nviews, and when it renounced systematic and retrograding aspirations,\r\nhad persuaded itself that, at least, the King's favour and the influence\r\nof the majority would give it power in the departments as at the seat of\r\ngovernment. The decree of the 5th of September, 1816, abolished this\r\ndouble expectation. The old Royalists called upon the new electoral\r\nsystem to restore it, but at once perceived that the bill of the 5th of\r\nFebruary was not calculated to produce such an effect; and forthwith\r\ncommenced a violent attack, accusing the new plan of giving over all\r\nelectoral power, and consequently all political influence, to the middle\r\nclasses, to the exclusion of the great proprietors and the people.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the popular party, who neither thought nor spoke on\r\nthe subject in 1817, adopted this argument in their turn, and charged,\r\non this same accusation of political monopoly for the benefit of the\r\nmiddle classes, their chief complaint, not only against the electoral\r\nlaw, but against the entire system of government of which that law was\r\nthe basis and guarantee.\r\n\r\nI collect my reminiscences, and call back my impressions. From 1814 to\r\n1848, under the government of the Restoration, and under that of July, I\r\nloudly supported and more than once had the honour of carrying this flag\r\nof the middle classes, which was naturally my own. What did we\r\nunderstand by it? Have we ever conceived the design, or even admitted\r\nthe thought, that the citizens should become a newly privileged order,\r\nand that the laws intended to regulate the exercise of suffrage should\r\nserve to found the predominance of the middle classes by taking, whether\r\nin right or fact, all political influence, on one side from the relics\r\nof the old French aristocracy, and on the other from the people?\r\n\r\nSuch an attempt would have been strangely ignorant and insane. It is\r\nneither by political theories nor articles in laws, that the privileges\r\nand superiority of any particular class are established in a State.\r\nThese slow and pedantic methods are not available for such a purpose; it\r\nrequires the force of conquest or the power of faith. Society is\r\nexclusively controlled by military or religious ascendency; never by the\r\ninfluence of the citizens. The history of all ages and nations is at\r\nhand to prove this to the most superficial observer.\r\n\r\nIn our day, the impossibility of such a predominance of the middle\r\nclasses is even more palpable. Two ideas constitute the great features\r\nof modern civilization, and stamp it with its formidable activity; I sum\r\nthem up in these terms:--There are certain universal rights inherent in\r\nman's nature, and which no system can legitimately withhold from any\r\none; there are individual rights which spring from personal merit alone,\r\nwithout regard to the external circumstances of birth, fortune, or rank,\r\nand which every one who has them in himself should be permitted to\r\nexercise. From the two principles of legal respect for the general\r\nrights of humanity, and the free development of natural gifts, ill or\r\nwell understood, have proceeded, for nearly a century, the advantages\r\nand evils, the great actions and crimes, the advances and wanderings\r\nwhich revolutions and Governments have alternately excited in the bosom\r\nof every European community. Which of these two principles provokes or\r\neven permits the exclusive supremacy of the middle classes? Assuredly\r\nneither the one nor the other. One opens to individual endowments every\r\ngate; the other demands for every human being his place and his portion:\r\nno greatness is unattainable; no condition, however insignificant, is\r\ncounted as nothing. Such principles are irreconcilable with exclusive\r\nsuperiority; that of the middle classes, as of every other, would be in\r\ndirect contradiction to the ruling tendencies of modern society.\r\n\r\nThe middle classes have never, amongst us, dreamed of becoming\r\nprivileged orders; and no rational mind has ever indulged in such dreams\r\nfor them. This idle accusation is but an engine of war, erected under\r\ncover of a confusion of ideas, sometimes by the hypocritical dexterity,\r\nand at others by the blind infatuation of party spirit. But this does\r\nnot prevent its having been, or becoming again, fatal to the peace of\r\nour social system; for men are so constructed that chimerical dangers\r\nare the most formidable they can encounter: we fight boldly with\r\ntangible substances, but we lose our heads, either from fear or anger,\r\nwhen in presence of phantoms.\r\n\r\nIt was with real dangers that we had to cope in 1817, when we discussed\r\nthe electoral system of France. We saw the most legitimate principles\r\nand the most jealous interests of the new state of society indistinctly\r\nmenaced by a violent reaction. We felt the spirit of revolution spring\r\nup and ferment around us, arming itself, according to old practice, with\r\nnoble incentives, to cover the march and prepare the triumph of the most\r\ninjurious passions. By instinct and position, the middle classes were\r\nthe best suited to struggle with the combined peril. Opposed to the\r\npretensions of the old aristocracy, they had acquired, under the Empire,\r\nideas and habits of government. Although they received the Restoration\r\nwith some mistrust, they were not hostile to it; for under the rule of\r\nthe Charter, they had nothing to ask from new revolutions. The Charter\r\nwas for them the Capitol and the harbour; they found in it the security\r\nof their conquests, and the triumph of their hopes. To turn to the\r\nadvantage of the ancient monarchy, now become constitutional, this\r\nanti-revolutionary state of the middle classes, to secure their\r\nco-operation with that monarchy by giving them confidence in their own\r\nposition, was a line of policy clearly indicated by the state of facts\r\nand opinions. Such was the bearing of the electoral bill of 1817. In\r\nprinciple this bill cut short the revolutionary theories of the\r\nsupremacy of numbers, and of a specious and tyrannical equality; in\r\nfact, it brought the new society under shelter from the threats of\r\ncounter-revolution. Assuredly, in proposing it, we had no intention of\r\nestablishing any antagonism between the great and small proprietors; but\r\nwhen the question was so laid down, we evinced no hesitation; we\r\nsupported the bill firmly, by maintaining that the influence, not\r\nexclusive but preponderating, of the middle classes was confirmed, on\r\none side by the spirit of free institutions, and on the other in\r\nconformity with the interests of France as the Revolution had changed\r\nher, and with the Restoration itself as the Charter had defined when\r\nproclaiming it.\r\n\r\nThe election bill occupied the session of 1816. The bill for recruiting\r\nwas the great subject and work of the session of 1817. The right-hand\r\nparty opposed it with vehement hostility: it disputed their traditions\r\nand disturbed their monarchical tendencies. But the party had to contest\r\nwith a minister as imperturbable in his convictions and will as in his\r\nphysiognomy. Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr had a powerful, original, and\r\nstraightforward mind, with no great combination of ideas, but\r\npassionately wedded to those which emanated from himself. He had\r\nresolved to give back to France what she no longer possessed--an army.\r\nAnd an army in his estimate was a small nation springing from the large\r\none, strongly organized, formed of officers and soldiers closely united,\r\nmutually knowing and respecting each other, all having defined rights\r\nand duties, and all well trained by solid study or long practice to\r\nserve their country effectually when called upon.\r\n\r\nUpon this idea of an army, according to the conception of Marshal St.\r\nCyr, the principles of his bill were naturally framed. Every class in\r\nthe State was required to assist in the formation of this army. Those\r\nwho entered in the lowest rank were open to the highest, with a certain\r\nadvantage in the ascending movement of the middle classes. Those who\r\nwere ambitious of occupying at once a higher step, were compelled in the\r\nfirst instance to pass certain examinations, and then to acquire by\r\nclose study the particular knowledge necessary to their post. The term\r\nof service, active or in reserve, was long, and made military life in\r\nreality a career. The obligations imposed, the privileges promised, and\r\nthe rights recognized for all, were guaranteed by the bill.\r\n\r\nBesides these general principles, the bill had an immediate result which\r\nSt. Cyr ardently desired. It enrolled again in the new army, under the\r\nhead of veterans and reserve, the remains of the old discharged legions,\r\nwho had so heroically endured the penalty of the errors committed by\r\ntheir crowned leader. It effaced also, in their minds, that reminiscence\r\nof a distasteful past, while by a sort of special Charter it secured\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny that this plan for the military organization of France,\r\nembraced grand ideas and noble sentiments. Such a bill accorded with the\r\nmoral nature and political conduct of Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, who\r\npossessed an upright soul, a proud temperament, monarchical opinions,\r\nand republican manners; and who, since 1814, had given equal proofs of\r\nloyalty and independence. When he advocated it in the tribune, when,\r\nwith the manly solemnity and disciplined feeling of an experienced\r\nwarrior, at once a sincere patriot and a royalist, he recapitulated the\r\nservices and sufferings of that nation of old soldiers which he was\r\nanxious for a few years longer to unite with the new army of France, he\r\ndeeply moved the public and the Chambers; and his powerful language, no\r\nless than the excellent propositions of his bill, consecrated it on the\r\ninstant in the affectionate esteem of the country.\r\n\r\nViolently attacked in 1818, Marshal St. Cyr's recruiting bill has been\r\nsince that date several times criticised, revised, and modified. Its\r\nleading principles have resisted assault, and have survived alteration.\r\nIt has done more than last, through soundness of principle; it has\r\ngiven, by facts, an astounding denial to its adversaries. It was accused\r\nof striking a blow at the monarchy; on the contrary, it has made the\r\narmy more devotedly monarchical than any that France had ever known,--an\r\narmy whose fidelity has never been shaken, either in 1830 or 1848, by\r\nthe influence of popular opinion, or the seduction of a revolutionary\r\ncrisis. Military sentiment, that spirit of obedience and respect, of\r\ndiscipline and devotion, one of the chief glories of human nature, and\r\nthe necessary pledge of the honour as of the safety of nations, had been\r\npowerfully fomented and developed in France by the great wars of the\r\nRevolution and the Empire. It was a precious inheritance of those rough\r\ntimes which have bequeathed to us so many burdens. There was danger of\r\nits being lost or enfeebled in the bosom of peaceful inaction, and\r\nduring endless debates on liberty. It has been firmly maintained in the\r\narmy which the law of 1818 established and incessantly recruits. This\r\nmilitary sentiment is not only preserved; it has become purified and\r\nregulated. By the honesty of its promises and the justice of its\r\narrangements in matters of privilege and promotion, the bill of Marshal\r\nSt. Cyr has imbued the army with a permanent conviction of its rights,\r\nof its own legal and individual rights, and, through that feeling, with\r\nan instinctive attachment to public order, the common guarantee of all\r\nrights. We have witnessed the rare and imposing sight of an army capable\r\nof devotion and restraint, ready for sacrifices, and modest in\r\npretension, ambitious of glory, without being athirst for war, proud of\r\nits arms, and yet obedient to civil authority. Public habits, the\r\nprevailing ideas of the time, and the general character of our\r\ncivilization have doubtless operated much upon this great result; but\r\nthe bill of Marshal St. Cyr has had its full part, and I rejoice in\r\nrecording this honourable distinction, which, amongst so many others,\r\nbelongs to my old and glorious friend.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1818, which opened in the midst of a ministerial crisis,\r\nhad to deal with another question not more important, but even more\r\nintricate and dangerous. The Cabinet determined to leave the press no\r\nlonger under an exceptional and temporary law. M. de Serre, at that time\r\nChancellor, introduced three bills on the same day, which settled\r\ndefinitively the penalty, the method of prosecution, and the\r\nqualification for publishing, in respect to the daily papers, while at\r\nthe same time they liberated them from all censorship.\r\n\r\nI am one of those who have been much assisted and fiercely attacked by\r\nthe press. Throughout my life, I have greatly employed this engine. By\r\nplacing my ideas publicly before the eyes of my country, I first\r\nattracted her attention and esteem. During the progress of my career, I\r\nhave ever had the press for ally or opponent; and I have never hesitated\r\nto employ its weapons, or feared to expose myself to its blows. It is a\r\npower which I respect and recognize willingly, rather than compulsorily,\r\nbut without illusion or idolatry. Whatever may be the form of\r\ngovernment, political life is a constant struggle; and it would give me\r\nno satisfaction--I will even say more--I should feel ashamed of finding\r\nmyself opposed to mute and fettered adversaries. The liberty of the\r\npress is human nature displaying itself in broad daylight, sometimes\r\nunder the most attractive, and at others under the most repelling\r\naspect; it is the wholesome air that vivifies, and the tempest that\r\ndestroys, the expansion and impulsive power of steam in the intellectual\r\nsystem. I have ever advocated a free press; I believe it to be, on the\r\nwhole, more useful than injurious to public morality; and I look upon it\r\nas essential to the proper management of public affairs, and to the\r\nsecurity of private interests. But I have witnessed too often and too\r\nclosely its dangerous aberrations as regards political order, not to\r\nfeel convinced that this liberty requires the restraint of a strong\r\norganization of effective laws and of controlling principles. In 1819,\r\nmy friends and I clearly foresaw the necessity of these conditions; but\r\nwe laid little stress upon them, we were unable to bring them all into\r\noperation, and we thought, moreover, that the time had arrived when the\r\nsincerity as well as the strength of the restored monarchy was to be\r\nproved by removing from the press its previous shackles, and in risking\r\nthe consequences of its enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the laws passed with reference to the press, in\r\nFrance or elsewhere, have either been acts of repression, legitimate or\r\nillegitimate, against liberty, or triumphs over certain special\r\nguarantees of liberty successively won from power, according to the\r\nnecessity or opportunity of gaining them. The legislative history of the\r\npress in England supplies a long series of alternations and arrangements\r\nof this class.\r\n\r\nThe bills of 1819 had a totally different character. They comprised a\r\ncomplete legislation, conceived together and beforehand, conformable\r\nwith certain general principles, defining in every degree liabilities\r\nand penalties, regulating all the conditions as well as the forms of\r\npublication, and intended to establish and secure the liberty of the\r\npress, while protecting order and power from its licentiousness;--an\r\nundertaking very difficult in its nature, as all legislative enactments\r\nmust be which spring from precaution more than necessity, and in which\r\nthe legislator is inspired and governed by ideas rather than commanded\r\nand directed by facts. Another danger, a moral and concealed danger,\r\nalso presented itself. Enactments thus prepared and maintained become\r\nworks of a philosopher and artist, the author of which is tempted to\r\nidentify himself with them through an impulse of self-love, which\r\nsometimes leads him to lose sight of the external circumstances and\r\npractical application he ought to have considered. Politics require a\r\ncertain mixture of indifference and passion, of freedom of thought and\r\nrestrained will, which is not easily reconciled with a strong adhesion\r\nto general ideas, and a sincere intent to hold a just balance between\r\nthe many principles and interests of society.\r\n\r\nI should be unwilling to assert that in the measures proposed and passed\r\nin 1819, on the liberty of the press, we had completely avoided these\r\nrocks, or that they were in perfect harmony with the state of men's\r\nminds, and the exigencies of order at that precise epoch. Nevertheless,\r\nafter an interval of nearly forty years, and on reconsidering these\r\nmeasures now with my matured judgment, I do not hesitate to look on them\r\nas grand and noble efforts of legislation, in which the true points of\r\nthe subject were skilfully embraced and applied, and which, in spite of\r\nthe mutilation they were speedily doomed to undergo, established an\r\nadvance in the liberty of the press, properly understood, which sooner\r\nor later cannot fail to extend itself.\r\n\r\nThe debate on these bills was worthy of their conception. M. de Serre\r\nwas gifted with eloquence singularly exalted and practical. He supported\r\ntheir general principles in the tone of a magistrate who applies, and\r\nnot as a philosopher who explains them. His speech was profound without\r\nabstraction, highly coloured but not figurative; his reasoning resolved\r\nitself into action. He expounded, examined, discussed, attacked, or\r\nreplied without literary or even oratorical preparation, carrying up the\r\nstrength of his arguments to the full level of the questions, fertile\r\nwithout exuberance, precise without dryness, impassioned without a\r\nshadow of declamation, always ready with a sound answer to his\r\nopponents, as powerful on the impulse of the moment as in prepared\r\nreflection, and, when once he had surmounted a slight hesitation and\r\nslowness at the first onset, pressing on directly to his end with a firm\r\nand rapid step, and with the air of a man deeply interested, but\r\ncareless of personal success, and only anxious to win his cause by\r\ncommunicating to his listeners his own sentiments and convictions.\r\n\r\nDifferent adversaries presented themselves during the debate, from those\r\nwho had opposed the bills for elections and recruiting the army. The\r\nright-hand party attacked the two latter propositions; the left assailed\r\nthe measures regarding the press. MM. Benjamin Constant, Manuel,\r\nChauvelin, and Bignon, with more parliamentary malice than political\r\njudgment, overwhelmed them with objections and amendments slightly\r\nmingled with very qualified compliments. Recent elections had lately\r\nreadmitted into the assembly these leaders of the Liberals in the\r\nChamber of the Hundred Days. They seemed to think of nothing but how to\r\nbring once more upon the scene their party, for three years beaten down,\r\nand to re-establish their own position as popular orators. Some of the\r\nmost prominent ideas in the drawing up of these three bills, were but\r\nlittle in conformity with the philosophic and legislative traditions\r\nwhich since 1791 had become current on the subject. They evidently\r\ncomprised a sincere wish to guarantee liberty, and a strong desire not\r\nto disarm power. It was a novel exhibition to see Ministers frankly\r\nrecognizing the liberty of the press, without offering up incense on its\r\nshrine, and assuming that they understood its rights and interests\r\nbetter than its old worshippers. In the opposition of the left-hand\r\nparty at this period, there was much of routine, a great deal of\r\ncomplaisance for the prejudices and passions of the press attached to\r\ntheir party, and a little angry jealousy of a cabinet which permitted\r\nliberal innovation. The public, unacquainted with political factions,\r\nwere astonished to see bills so vehemently opposed which diminished the\r\npenalties in force against the press, referred to a jury all offences of\r\nthat class, and liberated the journals from the censorship,--measures\r\nwhich in their eyes appeared too confident. The right-hand party held\r\ndexterously aloof, rejoicing to see the Ministers at issue with reviving\r\nopponents who were likely soon to become their most formidable enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was during this debate that I ascended the tribune for the first\r\ntime. M. Cuvier and I had been appointed, as Royal Commissioners, to\r\nsupport the proposed measures,--a false and weak position, which\r\ndemonstrates the infancy of representative government. We do not argue\r\npolitics as we plead a cause or maintain a thesis. To act effectively in\r\na deliberative assembly, we must ourselves be deliberators; that is to\r\nsay, we must be members, and hold our share with others in free\r\nthought, power, and responsibility. I believe that I acquitted myself\r\nwith propriety, but coldly, of the mission I had undertaken. I\r\nsustained, against M. Benjamin Constant, the general responsibility for\r\nthe correctness of the accounts given of the proceedings of the\r\nChambers, and, against M. Daunou, the guarantees required by the bill\r\nfor the establishment of newspapers. The Chamber appeared to appreciate\r\nmy arguments, and listened to me with attention. But I kept on the\r\nreserve, and seldom joined in the debate; I have no turn for incomplete\r\npositions and prescribed parts. When we enter into an arena in which the\r\naffairs of a free country are discussed, it is not to make a display of\r\nfine thoughts and words; we are bound to engage in the struggle as true\r\nand earnest actors.\r\n\r\nAs the recruiting bill had established a personal and political\r\nreputation for Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, so the bills on the press\r\neffected the same for M. de Serre. Thus, at the issue of a violent\r\ncrisis of revolution and war, in presence of armed Europe, and within\r\nthe short space of three sessions, the three most important questions of\r\na free system--the construction of elective power, the formation of a\r\nnational army, and the interference of individual opinions in public\r\naffairs through the channel of the press--were freely proposed, argued,\r\nand resolved; and their solution, whatever might be the opinion of\r\nparties, was certainly in harmony with the habits and wishes of that\r\nhonest and peaceably disposed majority of France who had sincerely\r\nreceived the King and the Charter, and had adopted their government on\r\nmature consideration.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, many other measures of constitutional organization,\r\nor general legislation, had been accomplished or proposed. In 1818, an\r\namendment of M. Royer-Collard settled the addition to the budget of an\r\nannual law for the supervision of public accounts; and in the course of\r\nthe following year, two ministers of finance, the Baron Louis and\r\nM. Roy, brought into operation that security for the honest\r\nappropriation of the revenue. By the institution of smaller\r\n\"Great-books\" of the national debt, the state of public credit became\r\nknown in the departments. Other bills, although laid before the\r\nChambers, produced no result; three, amongst the rest, may be named: on\r\nthe responsibility of Ministers, on the organization of the Chamber of\r\nPeers into a court of justice, and on the alteration of the financial\r\nyear to avoid the provisional vote of the duty. Others again, especially\r\napplicable to the reform of departmental and parochial administrations,\r\nand to public instruction, were left in a state of inquiry and\r\npreliminary discussion. Far from eluding or allowing important questions\r\nto linger, the Government laboriously investigated them, and forestalled\r\nthe wishes of the public, determined to submit them to the Chambers as\r\nsoon as they had collected facts and arranged their own plans.\r\n\r\nI still preserve a deep remembrance of the State Council in which these\r\nvarious bills were first discussed. This Council had not then any\r\ndefined official existence or prescribed action in the constitution of\r\nthe country; politics nevertheless were more prominently argued there,\r\nand with greater freedom and effect, than at any other time; every\r\nshade, I ought rather to say every variation, of the royalist party,\r\nfrom the extreme right to the edge of the left, were there represented;\r\nthe politicians most in repute, the leaders of the majority in the two\r\nAssemblies, were brought into contact with the heads of administration,\r\nthe old senators of the Empire, and with younger men not yet admissible\r\nto the Chambers, but introduced by the Charter into public life.\r\nMM. Royer-Collard, de Serre, and Camille Jordan sat there by the side of\r\nMM. Simeon, Portalis, Mole, Berenger, Cuvier, and Allent; and\r\nMM. de Barante, Mounier, and myself deliberated in common with\r\nMM. de Ballainvilliers, Laporte-Lalanne, and de Blaire, unswerving\r\nrepresentatives of the old system. When important bills were examined by\r\nthe Council, the Ministers never failed to attend. The Duke de Richelieu\r\noften presided at the general sittings. The discussion was perfectly\r\nfree, without oratorical display or pretension, but serious, profound,\r\nvaried, detailed, earnest, erudite, and at the same time practical. I\r\nhave heard Count Berenger, a man of disputatious and independent temper,\r\nand a quasi-republican under the Empire, maintain there, with ingenious\r\nand imposing subtlety, universal suffrage, and distinctions of\r\nqualification for voting, against direct election and the concentrated\r\nright of suffrage. MM. Cuvier, Simeon, and Allent were the constant\r\ndefenders of traditional and administrative influence. My friends and I\r\nargued strongly for the principles and hopes of liberty strongly based,\r\nwhich appeared to us the natural consequences of the Charter and the\r\nnecessary conditions for the prosperity of the Restoration. Reforms in\r\ncriminal legislation, the application of trial by jury to offences of\r\nthe press, the introduction of the elective principle into the\r\nmunicipal system, were argued in the Council of State before they were\r\nlaid before the Chambers. The Government looked to the Council, not only\r\nfor a study of all questions, but for a preparatory and amicable\r\nexperience of the ideas, desires, and objections it was destined to\r\nencounter at a later period, in a rougher contest, and a more tumultuous\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet, composed as it was at the time when the decree of the 5th\r\nof September, 1816, appeared, was not equal to that line of policy,\r\ncontinually increasing in moderation, sometimes resolutely, liberal,\r\nand, if not always provident, at least perpetually active. But the same\r\nprogress which accompanied events, affected individuals. During the\r\ncourse of the year 1817, M. Pasquier, Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, and\r\nM. Mole replaced M. Dambray, the Duke of Feltri, and M. Dubouchage in\r\nthe departments of justice, war, and the marine. From that time the\r\nMinisters were not deficient either in internal unity, or in\r\nparliamentary and administrative talent. They endeavoured to infuse the\r\nsame qualities into all the different branches and gradations of\r\ngovernment, and succeeded tolerably in the heart of the State. Without\r\nreaction or any exclusive spirit, they surrounded themselves with men\r\nsincerely attached to a constitutional policy, and who by their\r\ncharacter and ability had already won public esteem. They were less firm\r\nand effective in local administration; although introducing more changes\r\nthan are generally believed, they were unable to reconcile them with\r\ntheir general policy. In many places, acts of violence, capricious\r\ntemper, haughty inexperience, offensive pretension and frivolous alarm,\r\nwith all the great and little party passions which had possessed the\r\nGovernment of 1815, continued to weigh upon the country. These\r\nproceedings kept up amongst the tranquil population a strong sentiment\r\nof uneasiness, and sometimes excited active malcontents to attempts at\r\nconspiracy and insurrection, amplified at first with interested or\r\nabsurd credulity, repressed with unmitigated rigour, and subsequently\r\ndiscussed, denied, extenuated, and reduced almost to nothing by\r\nnever-ending explanations and counter-charges. From thence arose the\r\nmistakes, prejudices, and false calculations of the local authorities;\r\nwhile the supreme powers assumed alternately airs of levity or weakness,\r\nwhich made them lose, in the eyes of the multitude, the credit of that\r\nsound general policy from which they, the masses, experienced little\r\nadvantage. The occurrences at Lyons in June 1817, and the long debates\r\nof which they became the subject after the mission of redress of the\r\nDuke of Ragusa, furnish a lamentable example of the evils which France\r\nat this period had still to endure, although at the head of government\r\nthe original cause had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThings are more easily managed than men. These same Ministers, who were\r\nnot always able to compel the prefects and mayors to adopt their policy,\r\nand who hesitated to displace them when they were found to be obstinate\r\nor incapable, were ever prompt and effective when general administration\r\nwas involved, and measures not personal were necessary for the public\r\ninterest. On this point, reflection tells me that justice has not been\r\nrendered to the Government of the day; religious establishments, public\r\ninstruction, hospital and prison discipline, financial and military\r\nadministration, the connection of power with industry and commerce, all\r\nthe great public questions, received from 1816 to 1820 much salutary\r\nreform and made important advances. The Duke de Richelieu advocated an\r\nenlightened policy and the public good; he took pride in contributing to\r\nboth. M. Laine devoted himself with serious and scrupulous anxiety to\r\nthe superintendence of the many establishments included in his\r\ndepartment, and laboured to rectify existing abuses or to introduce\r\nsalutary limitations. The Baron Louis was an able and indefatigable\r\nminister, who knew to a point how regularity could be established in the\r\nfinances of the State, and who employed for that object all the\r\nresources of his mind and the unfettered energy of his will. Marshal\r\nGouvion St. Cyr had, on every branch of military organization, on the\r\nformation and internal system of the different bodies, on the scientific\r\nschools as well as on the material supplies, ideas at once systematic\r\nand practical, derived either from his general conception of the army or\r\nfrom long experience; and these he carried into effect in a series of\r\nregulations remarkable for the unity of their views and the profound\r\nknowledge of their details. M. Decazes was endowed with a singularly\r\ninquiring and inventive mind in seeking to satisfy doubts, to attempt\r\nimprovements, to stimulate emulation and concord for the advantage of\r\nall social interests, of all classes of citizens, in connection with the\r\nGovernment; and these combined objects he invariably promoted with\r\nintelligent, amiable, and eager activity. In a political point of view,\r\nthe Administration left much to regret and to desire; but in its proper\r\nsphere it was liberal, energetic, impartial, economical from probity and\r\nregularity, friendly to progress at the same time that it was careful of\r\norder, and sincerely impressed with the desire of giving universal\r\nprevalence to justice and the public interest.[14]\r\n\r\nHere was undoubtedly a sensible and sound Government, in very difficult\r\nand lamentable circumstances; and under such rule the country had no\r\noccasion to lament the present or despair of the future. Nevertheless\r\nthis Government gained no strength by permanence; its enemies felt no\r\ndiscouragement, while its friends perceived no addition to their power\r\nor security. The Restoration had given peace to France, and laboured\r\nhonestly and successfully to restore her independence and rank in\r\nEurope. Under this flag of stability and order, prosperity and liberty\r\nsprang up again together. Still the Restoration was always a disputed\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIf we are to believe its enemies, this evil was inherent and inevitable.\r\nAccording to them the old system, the emigrants, the foreigners, the\r\nhatreds and suspicions of the Revolution devoted the House of Bourbon to\r\ntheir obstinately precarious situation. Without disputing the influence\r\nof such a fatal past, I cannot admit that it exercised complete empire\r\nover events, or that it suffices in itself to explain why the\r\nRestoration, even in its best days, always was and appeared to be in a\r\ntottering state. The mischief sprang from more immediate and more\r\npersonal causes. In the Government of that date there were organic and\r\naccidental infirmities, vices of the political machine and errors of the\r\nactors, which contributed much more than revolutionary remembrances to\r\nprevent its firm consolidation.\r\n\r\nA natural and important disagreement exists between the representative\r\ngovernment instituted by the Charter, and the administrative monarchy\r\nfounded by Louis XIV. and Napoleon. Where administration and policy are\r\nequally free, when local affairs are discussed and decided by local\r\nauthorities or influences, and neither derive their impulse nor solution\r\nfrom the central power, which never interferes except when the general\r\ninterest of the State absolutely requires it to do so,--as in England,\r\nand in the United States of America, in Holland and Belgium, for\r\ninstances,--the representative system readily accords with an\r\nadministrative Government which never appeals to its co-operation except\r\non important and rare occasions. But when the supreme authority\r\nundertakes at the same time to govern with freedom, and to administer by\r\ncentralization,--when it has to contend, at the seat of power, for the\r\ngreat affairs of the State, and to regulate, under its own\r\nresponsibility, in all the departments, the minor business of every\r\ndistrict,--two weighty objections immediately present themselves: either\r\nthe central power, absorbed by the care of national questions, and\r\noccupied with its own defence, neglects local affairs, and suffers them\r\nto fall into disorder and inaction; or it connects them closely with\r\ngeneral questions, making them subservient to its own interests; and\r\nthus the whole system of administration, from the hamlet to the palace,\r\ndegenerates into an implement of government in the hands of political\r\nparties who are mutually contending for power.\r\n\r\nI am certainly not called upon today to dwell on this evil; it has\r\nbecome the hackneyed theme of the adversaries of representative\r\ngovernment, and of political liberty. It was felt long before it was\r\ntaken advantage of; but instead of employing it against free\r\ninstitutions, an attempt was made to effect its cure. To achieve this\r\nend, a double work was to be accomplished; it was necessary to infuse\r\nliberty into the administration of local affairs, and to second the\r\ndevelopment of the local forces capable of exercising authority within\r\ntheir own circle. An aristocracy cannot be created by laws, either at\r\nthe extremities or at the fountain-head of the State; but the most\r\ndemocratic society is not stripped of natural powers ready to display\r\nthemselves when called into action. Not only in the departments, but in\r\nthe divisions, in the townships and villages, landed property, industry,\r\nemployments, professions, and traditions have their local influences,\r\nwhich, if adopted and organized with prudence, constitute effectual\r\nauthority. From 1816 to 1848, under each of the two constitutional\r\nmonarchies, whether voluntarily or by compulsion, the different cabinets\r\nhave acted under this conviction; they have studied to relieve the\r\ncentral Government, by remitting a portion of its functions, sometimes\r\nto the regular local agents, and at others to more independent\r\nauxiliaries. But, as it too often happens, the remedy was not rapid\r\nenough in operation; mistrust, timidity, inexperience, and routine\r\nslackened its progress; neither the authorities nor the people knew how\r\nto employ it with resolution, or to wait the results with patience. Thus\r\ncompelled to sustain the burden of political liberty with that of\r\nadministrative centralization, the newly-born constitutional monarchy\r\nfound itself compromised between difficulties and contradictory\r\nresponsibilities, exceeding the measure of ability and strength which\r\ncould be reasonably expected from any Government.\r\n\r\nAnother evil, the natural but not incurable result of these very\r\ninstitutions, weighed also upon the Restoration. The representative\r\nsystem is at the bottom, and on close analysis, a system of mutual\r\nsacrifices and dealings between the various interests which coexist in\r\nsociety. At the same time that it places them in antagonism, it imposes\r\non them the absolute necessity of arriving at an intermediate term, a\r\ndefinite measure of reciprocal understanding and toleration which may\r\nbecome the basis of laws and government. But also, at the same time, by\r\nthe publicity and heat of the struggle, it throws the opposing parties\r\ninto an unseemly exaggeration of vehemence and language, and compromises\r\nthe self-love and personal dignity of human nature. Thus, by an\r\ninconsistency teeming with embarrassment, it daily renders more\r\ndifficult that agreement or submission which, in the end, it has also\r\nmade indispensable. Herein is comprised an important difficulty for this\r\nsystem of government, which can only be surmounted by a great exercise\r\nof tact and conciliation on the part of the political actors\r\nthemselves, and by a great preponderance of good sense on that of the\r\npublic, which in the end recalls parliamentary factions and their\r\nleaders to that moderation after defeat, from which the inflated passion\r\nof the characters they have assumed too often tends to estrange them.\r\n\r\nThis necessary regulator, always difficult to find or institute, was\r\nessentially wanting to us under the Restoration; on entering the course,\r\nwe were launched, without curb, on this precipice of extreme\r\ndemonstrations and preconceived ideas, the natural vice of parties in\r\nevery representative government. How many opportunities presented\r\nthemselves from 1816 to 1830, when the different elements of the\r\nmonarchical party could, and in their struggle ought to have paused on\r\nthis brink, at the point where the danger of revolution commenced for\r\nall! But none had the good sense or courage to exercise this provident\r\nrestraint; and the public, far from imposing it on them, excited them\r\nstill more urgently to the combat,--as at a play, in which people\r\ndelight to trace the dramatic reflection of their own passions.\r\n\r\nA mischievous, although inevitable, distribution of parts between the\r\nopposing parties aggravated still more, from 1816 to 1820, this want of\r\nforecast in men, and this extravagance of public passions. Under the\r\nrepresentative system, it is usually to one of the parties distinctly\r\ndefined and firmly resolved in their ideas and desires, that the\r\ngovernment belongs: sometimes the systematic defenders of power, at\r\nothers the friends of liberty, then the conservatives, and lastly the\r\ninnovators, direct the affairs of the country; and between these\r\norganized and ambitious parties are placed the unclassed opinions and\r\nundecided wishes, that political chorus which is ever present watching\r\nthe conduct of the actors, listening to their words, and ready to\r\napplaud or condemn them according as they satisfy or offend their\r\nunfettered judgment. This is, in fact, the natural bias and true order\r\nof things under free institutions. It is well for Government to have a\r\npublic and recognized standard, regulated on fixed principles, and\r\nsustained in action by steady adherents; it derives from that position,\r\nnot only the strength and consistent coherence that it requires, but the\r\nmoral dignity which renders power more easy and gentle by placing it\r\nhigher in the estimation of the people. It is not the chance of events\r\nor the personal ambition of men alone, but the interests and inclination\r\nof the public, which have produced, in free countries, the great,\r\nacknowledged, permanent, and trusty political parties, and have usually\r\nconfided power to their hands. At the Restoration it was impossible,\r\nfrom 1816 to 1820, to fulfil this condition of a Government at once\r\nenergetic and restrained. The two great political parties which it found\r\nin action, that of the old system and of the revolution, were both at\r\nthe time incapable of governing by maintaining internal peace with\r\nliberty; each had ideas and passions too much opposed to the established\r\nand legal order they would have had to defend; they accepted with great\r\nreluctance, and in a very undefined sense, the one the Charter, and the\r\nother the old Monarchy. Through absolute necessity, power returned to\r\nthe hands of the political choir; the floating and impartial section of\r\nthe Chambers, the centre, was called to the helm. Under a free system,\r\nthe Centre is the habitual moderator and definitive judge of Government,\r\nbut not the party naturally pretending to govern. It gives or withholds\r\nthe majority, but its mission is not to conquer it. And it is much more\r\ndifficult for the centre than for strongly organized parties to win or\r\nmaintain a majority; for when it assumes government, it finds before it,\r\nnot undecided spectators who wait its acts to pass judgment on them, but\r\ninflamed adversaries resolved to combat them beforehand;--a weak and\r\ndangerous position, which greatly aggravates the difficulties of\r\nGovernment, whether engaged in the display of power, or the protection\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nNot only was this the situation of the King's Government from 1816 to\r\n1820, but even this was not regularly and powerfully established. Badly\r\ndistributed amongst the actors, the characters were doubtfully filled in\r\nthe interior of this new and uncertain party of the centre, on whom the\r\ngovernment, through necessity, devolved. The principal portion of the\r\nheads of the majority in the Chambers held no office. From 1816 to 1819,\r\nseveral of those who represented and directed the centre, who addressed\r\nand supported it with prevailing influence, who defended it from the\r\nattacks of the right and left-hand parties, who established its power in\r\ndebate and its credit with the public, MM. Royer-Collard, Camille\r\nJordan, Beugnot, and de Serre, were excluded from the Cabinet. Amongst\r\nthe eminent leaders of the majority, two only, M. Laine and M. Pasquier\r\nwere ministers. The Government, therefore, in the Chambers, relied on\r\nindependent supporters who approved of their policy in general, but\r\nneither bore any part in the burden, nor acknowledged any share in the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe doctrinarians had acquired their parliamentary influence and moral\r\nweight by principles and eloquence rather than by deeds; they maintained\r\ntheir opinions without applying them to practice; the flag of thought\r\nand the standard of action were in different hands. In the Chambers, the\r\nMinisters often appeared as the clients of the orators; the orators\r\nnever looked upon their cause as identical with that of the Ministers;\r\nthey preserved this distinction while supporting them; they had their\r\nown demands to make before they assented; they qualified their approval,\r\nand even sometimes dissented altogether. As the questions increased in\r\nimportance and delicacy, so much the more independence and discord\r\nmanifested themselves in the bosom of the ministerial party, with\r\ndangerous notoriety. During the session of 1817, M. Pasquier, then\r\nChancellor, presented a bill to the Chamber of Deputies, which, while\r\ntemporarily maintaining the censorship of the daily papers, comprised in\r\nother respects some modifications favourable to the liberty of the\r\npress. M. Camille Jordan and M. Royer-Collard demanded much greater\r\nconcessions, particularly the application of trial by jury to press\r\noffences; and the bill, reluctantly passed by the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nwas thrown out by the Chamber of Peers, when the Duke de Broglie urged\r\nthe same amendments on similar principles. In 1817 also, a new Concordat\r\nhad been negotiated and concluded at Rome by M. de Blacas. It contained\r\nthe double and contradictory defect of invading by some of its\r\nspecifications the liberties of the old Gallican Church; while, by the\r\nabolition of the Concordat of 1801, it inspired the new French society\r\nwith lively alarms for its civil liberties. Little versed in such\r\nmatters, and almost entirely absorbed in the negotiations for relieving\r\nFrance from the presence of foreigners, the Duke de Richelieu had\r\nconfided this business to M. de Blacas, who was equally ignorant and\r\ncareless of the importance of the old or new liberties of France,\r\nwhether civil or religious. When this Concordat, respecting which the\r\nMinisters themselves were discontented and doubtful when they had\r\ncarefully examined it, was presented to the Chamber of Deputies by\r\nM. Laine, with the measures necessary for carrying it into effect, it\r\nwas received with general disfavour. In committee, in the board\r\nappointed to report on it, in the discussions in the hall of conference,\r\nall the objections, political and historical, of principle or\r\ncircumstance, that the bill could possibly excite, were argued and\r\nexplained beforehand, so as to give warning of the most obstinate and\r\ndangerous debate. The doctrinarians openly declared for this premature\r\nopposition; and their support produced a strong effect, as they were\r\nknown to be sincere friends to religion and its influences. It is true,\r\nM. Royer-Collard was accused of being a Jansenist; and thus an attempt\r\nwas made to depreciate him in the eyes of the true believers of the\r\nCatholic Church. The reproach was frivolous. M. Royer-Collard had\r\nderived, from family traditions and early education, serious habits,\r\nstudious inclinations, and an affectionate respect for the exalted minds\r\nof Port-Royal, for their virtue and genius; but he neither adopted their\r\nreligious doctrines nor their systematic conclusions on the relative\r\nties between Church and State. On all these questions he exercised a\r\nfree and rational judgment, as a stranger to all extreme passion or\r\nsectarian prejudice, and not in the least disposed, either as Catholic\r\nor philosopher, to engage in obscure and endless quarrels with the\r\nChurch. \"I seek not to quibble with religion,\" he was wont to say; \"it\r\nhas enough to do to defend itself and us from impiety.\" The opposition\r\nof M. Royer-Collard to the Concordat of 1817 was the dissent of a\r\npolitician and enlightened moralist, who foresaw the mischief which the\r\npublic discussion, and adoption or rejection of this bill, would inflict\r\non the influence of the Church, the credit of the Restoration, and the\r\npeace of the country. The Cabinet had prudence enough not to brave a\r\ndanger which it had created, or suffered to grow on its steps. The\r\nreport on the bill was indefinitely adjourned, and a fresh negotiation\r\nwas opened with Rome by sending Count Portalis on a special mission,\r\nwhich ended in 1819 by the tacit withdrawal of the Concordat of 1817.\r\nThe Duke de Richelieu, pressed by his colleagues, and his own tardy\r\nreflections, coincided in this retrograde movement; but he maintained a\r\nfeeling of displeasure at the opposition of the doctrinarians and others\r\non this occasion, which he sometimes gratified himself by indulging. In\r\nthe month of March, 1818, some one, whose name I have forgotten,\r\ndemanded of him a trifling favour. \"It is impossible,\" replied he\r\nsharply; \"MM. Royer-Collard, de Serre, Camille Jordan, and Guizot will\r\nnot suffer it.\"\r\n\r\nI had no reason to complain that my name was included in this\r\nebullition. Although not a member of the Chamber, I openly adopted the\r\nopinions and conduct of my friends; I had both the opportunity and the\r\nmeans, in the discussions of the Council of State, in the drawing-room,\r\nand through the press,--channels which all parties employed with equal\r\nardour and effect. In spite of the shackles which restrained the papers\r\nand periodical publications, they freely exercised the liberty which the\r\nGovernment no longer attempted to dispute, and to which the most\r\ninfluential politicians had recourse, to disseminate far and wide the\r\nbrilliant flames or smouldering fire of their opposition.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, M. de Bonald, M. de Villele, in the 'Conservative,'\r\nand M. Benjamin Constant in the 'Minerva,' maintained an incessant\r\nassault on the Cabinet. The Cabinet in its defence, multiplied similar\r\npublications, such as the 'Moderator,' the 'Publicist,' and the\r\n'Political and Literary Spectator.' But, for my friends and our cause,\r\nthe defences of the Cabinet were not always desirable or sufficient; we\r\ntherefore, from 1817 to 1820, had our own journals and periodical\r\nmiscellanies,--the 'Courier,' the 'Globe,' the 'Philosophical,\r\nPolitical, and Literary Archives,' and the 'French Review;' and in these\r\nwe discussed, according to our principles and hopes, sometimes general\r\nquestions, and at others the incidental subjects of current policy, as\r\nthey alternately presented themselves. I contributed much to these\r\npublications. Between our different adversaries and ourselves the\r\ncontest was extremely unequal: whether they came from the right or the\r\nleft, they represented old parties; they expressed ideas and sentiments\r\nlong in circulation; they found a public predisposed to receive them.\r\nWe were intruders in the political arena, officers seeking to recruit an\r\narmy, moderate innovators. We attacked, in the name of liberty, theories\r\nand passions long popular under the same denomination. We defended the\r\nnew French society according to its true rights and interests, but not\r\nin conformity with its tastes or habits. We had to conquer our public,\r\nwhile we combated our enemies. In this difficult attempt our position\r\nwas somewhat doubtful: we were at the same time with and against the\r\nGovernment, royalists and liberals, ministerialists and independents; we\r\nacted sometimes in concert with the Administration, sometimes with the\r\nOpposition, and we were unable to avail ourselves of all the weapons of\r\neither power or liberty. But we were full of faith in our opinions, of\r\nconfidence in ourselves, of hope in the future; and we pressed forward\r\ndaily in our double contest, with as much devotion as pride, and with\r\nmore pride than ambition.\r\n\r\nAll this has been strenuously denied; my friends and I have often been\r\nrepresented as deep plotters, greedy for office, eager and shrewd in\r\npushing our fortunes through every opening, and more intent on our own\r\nascendency than on the fate or wishes of the country,--a vulgar and\r\nsenseless estimate, both of human nature and of our contemporary\r\nhistory. If ambition had been our ruling principle, we might have\r\nescaped many efforts and defeats. In times when the most brilliant\r\nfortunes, political or otherwise, were easily within reach of those who\r\nthought of nothing else, we only desired to achieve ours on certain\r\nmoral conditions, and with the object of not caring for ourselves.\r\nAmbition we had, but in the service of a public cause; and one which,\r\neither in success or adversity, has severely tried the constancy of its\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nThe most clear-sighted of the cabinet ministers in 1817, M. Decazes and\r\nM. Pasquier, whose minds were more free and less suspicious than those\r\nof the Duke de Richelieu and M. Laine, were not deceived on this point:\r\nthey felt the necessity of our alliance, and cultivated it with anxiety.\r\nBut when it becomes a question of how to govern in difficult times,\r\nallies are not enough; intimate associates are necessary, devoted\r\nadherents in labour and peril. In this character, the doctrinarians, and\r\nparticularly M. Royer-Collard, their leader in the Chambers, were\r\nmistrusted. They were looked upon as at once imperious and undecided,\r\nand more exacting than effective. Nevertheless, in November, 1819, after\r\nthe election of M. Gregoire and in the midst of their projected reforms\r\nin the electoral law, M. Decazes, at the strong instigation of\r\nM. de Serre, proposed to M. Royer-Collard to join the Cabinet with one\r\nor two of his friends. M. Royer-Collard hesitated at first, then acceded\r\nfor a moment, and finally declined. \"You know not what you would do,\"\r\nsaid he to M. Decazes; \"my method of dealing with affairs would differ\r\nentirely from yours: you elude questions, you shift and change them, you\r\ngain time, you settle things by halves; I, on the contrary, should\r\nattack them in front, bring them into open view, and dissect them before\r\nall the world. I should compromise instead of assisting you.\"\r\nM. Royer-Collard was in the right, and defined himself admirably,\r\nperhaps more correctly than he imagined. He was more calculated to\r\nadvise and contest than to exercise power. He was rather a great\r\nspectator and critic than an eminent political actor. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of affairs he would have been too absolute, too haughty, and too\r\nslow. In a crisis, I question whether his mental reservations, his\r\nscruples of conscience, his horror of all public excitement, and his\r\nprevailing dread of responsibility, would have permitted him to preserve\r\nthe cool self-possession, with the firm and prompt determination, which\r\ncircumstances might have required. M. Decazes pressed him no further.\r\n\r\nEven at this moment, after all I have seen and experienced, I am not\r\nprone to be discouraged, or inclined to believe that difficult\r\nachievements are impossible. However defective may be the internal\r\nconstitution and combinations of the different parties who co-operate in\r\ncarrying on public affairs, the upright conduct of individuals may\r\nremedy them; history furnishes more than one example of vicious\r\ninstitutions and situations, the evil results of which have been\r\ncounteracted by the ability of political leaders and the sound sense of\r\nthe public. But when to the evils of position, the errors of men are\r\nadded,--when, instead of recognizing dangers in their true tendency, and\r\nopposing firm resistance, the chiefs and followers of parties either\r\nyield to or accelerate them, then the mischievous effects of pernicious\r\ncourses inevitably and rapidly develop themselves. Errors were not\r\nwanting from 1816 to 1820 in every party, whether of Government or\r\nOpposition, of the centre, the right, or the left, of the ministers or\r\ndoctrinarians. I make no parade of impartiality; in spite of their\r\nfaults and misfortunes, I continue, with a daily increasing conviction,\r\nto look upon the Government I served, and the party I supported, to have\r\nbeen the best; but, for our own credit, let leisure and reflection teach\r\nus to acknowledge the mistakes we committed, and to prepare for our\r\ncause--which assuredly will not die with us--a more auspicious future.\r\n\r\nThe centre, in its governing mission, had considerable advantages; it\r\nsuffered neither from moral embarrassments nor external clogs, it was\r\nperfectly free and unshackled,--essential qualifications in a great\r\npublic career, and which at that time belonged neither to the right nor\r\nto the left-hand party.\r\n\r\nThe right had only accepted the Charter on the eve of its promulgation,\r\nand after strenuous resistance; a conspicuous and energetic section of\r\nthe party still persisted in opposing it. That division which had seats\r\nin the Chambers, sided from day to day with the constitutional\r\nsystem,--the officers as intelligent and reflecting men, the soldiers as\r\nstaunch and contented royalists; but neither, in these recognized\r\ncapacities, inspired confidence in the country, which looked upon their\r\nadhesion to the Charter as constrained or conditional, always insincere\r\nand covering other views. The right, even while honestly accepting the\r\nCharter, had also party interests to satisfy; when it aspired to power,\r\nit was not solely to govern according to its principles, and to place\r\nthe restored monarchy on a solid basis: it had private misfortunes to\r\nrepair and positions to re-assume. It was not a pure and regular party\r\nof Tory royalists. The emigrants, the remains of the old court and\r\nclergy, were still influential amongst them, and eagerly bent on\r\ncarrying out their personal expectations. By its composition and\r\nreminiscences, the party was condemned to much reserve and imprudence,\r\nto secret aspirations and indiscreet ebullitions, which, even while it\r\nprofessed to walk in constitutional paths, embarrassed and weakened its\r\naction at every step.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the left was no less confused. It represented, at that\r\nexact epoch, not the interests and sentiments of France in general, but\r\nthe interests and sentiments of that portion of France which had\r\nardently, indistinctly, and obstinately promoted and sustained the\r\nRevolution, under its republican or imperial form. It cherished against\r\nthe House of Bourbon and the Restoration an old habit of hostility,\r\nwhich the Hundred Days had revived, which the most rational of the party\r\ncould scarcely throw off, the most skilful with difficulty concealed,\r\nand the gravest considered it a point of honour to display as a protest\r\nand corner-stone. In November 1816, a man of probity, as sincere in the\r\nrenunciation of his opinions of 1789 as he had formerly been in their\r\nprofession, the Viscount Matthieu de Montmorency, complained, in a\r\ndrawing-room of the party, that the Liberals had no love for legitimacy.\r\nA person present defended himself from this reproach. \"Yes,\" said\r\nM. de Montmorency, with thoughtless candour, \"you love legitimacy as we\r\ndo the Charter.\" A keen satire on the false position of both parties\r\nunder the government of the Charter and of legitimacy!\r\n\r\nBut if the right-hand party or the left, if the members of either in the\r\nChambers, had followed only their sincere convictions and desires, the\r\ngreater portion, I am satisfied, would have frankly accepted and\r\nsupported the Restoration with the Charter, the Charter with the\r\nRestoration. When men are seriously engaged in a work and feel the\r\nweight of responsibility, they soon discover the true course, and would\r\nwillingly follow it. But, both in the right and left, the wisest and\r\nbest-disposed feared to proclaim the truth which they saw, or to adopt\r\nit as their rule of conduct; both were under the yoke of their external\r\nparty, of its passions as of its interests, of its ignorance as of its\r\npassions. It has been one of the sorest wounds of our age, that few men\r\nhave preserved sufficient firmness of mind and character to think\r\nfreely, and act as they think. The intellectual and moral independence\r\nof individuals disappeared under the pressure of events and before the\r\nheat of popular clamours and desires. Under such a general slavery of\r\nthought and action, there are no longer just or mistaken minds, cautious\r\nor rash spirits, officers or soldiers; all yield to the same controlling\r\npassion, and bend before the same wind; common weakness reduces all to\r\none common level; hierarchy and discipline vanish; the last lead the\r\nfirst; for the last press and drive onwards, being themselves impelled\r\nby that tyranny from without, of which they have been the most blind and\r\nready instruments.\r\n\r\nAs a political party, the centre, in the Chambers from 1816 to 1820, was\r\nnot tainted by this evil. Sincere in its adoption of the Restoration and\r\nthe Charter, no external pressure could disturb or falsify its position.\r\nIt remained unfettered in thought and deed. It openly acknowledged its\r\nobject, and marched directly towards it; selecting, within, the leaders\r\nmost capable of conducting it there, and having no supporters without\r\nwho looked for any other issue. It was thus that, in spite of its other\r\ndeficiencies for powerful government, the centre was at that time the\r\nfittest party to rule, the only one capable of maintaining order in the\r\nState, while tolerating the liberty of its rivals.\r\n\r\nBut to reap the full fruits of this advantage, and to diminish at the\r\nsame time the natural defects of the centre in its mission, it was\r\nnecessary that it should adopt a fixed idea, a conviction that the\r\ndifferent elements of the party were indispensable to each other; and\r\nthat, to accomplish the object pursued by all with equal sincerity,\r\nmutual concessions and sacrifices were called for, to maintain this\r\nnecessary union. When Divine wisdom intended to secure the power of a\r\nhuman connection, it forbade divorce. Political ties cannot admit this\r\ninviolability; but if they are not strongly knit, if the contracting\r\nparties are not firmly resolved to break them only in the last extremity\r\nand under the most imperious pressure, they soon end, not only in\r\nimpotence, but in disorder; and by their too easy rupture, policy\r\nbecomes exposed to new difficulties and disturbances. I have thus\r\npointed out the discrepancies and different opinions which, from the\r\nbeginning, existed between the two principal elements of the centre: the\r\nMinisters, with their pure adherents, on the one side, and the\r\ndoctrinarians on the other. From the second session after the decree of\r\nthe 5th of September, 1816, these differences increased until they grew\r\ninto dissensions.\r\n\r\nWhile acknowledging the influence of the doctrinarians in the Chambers,\r\nand the importance of their co-operation, neither the Ministers nor\r\ntheir advocates measured correctly the value of this alliance, or the\r\nweight of the foundation from which that value was derived. Philosophers\r\nestimate too highly the general ideas with which they are prepossessed;\r\npoliticians withhold from general ideas the attention and interest they\r\nare entitled to demand. Intelligence is proud and sensitive; it looks\r\nfor consideration and respect, even though its suggestions may be\r\ndisallowed; and those who treat it lightly or coldly sometimes pay\r\nheavily for their mistake. It is, moreover, an evidence of narrow\r\nintellect not to appreciate the part which general principles assume in\r\nthe government of men, or to regard them as useless or hostile because\r\nwe are not disposed to adopt them as guides. In our days, especially,\r\nand notwithstanding the well-merited disrepute into which so many\r\ntheories have fallen, philosophic deduction, on all the leading\r\nquestions and facts of policy, is a sustaining power, on which the\r\nablest and most secure ministers would do wisely to rely. The\r\ndoctrinarians at that period represented this power, and employed it\r\nfearlessly against the spirit of revolution, as well as in favour of the\r\nconstitutional system. The Cabinet of 1816 undervalued the part they\r\nplayed, and paid too little attention to their ideas and desires. The\r\napplication of trial by jury to offences of the press was not, I admit,\r\nunattended by danger; but it was much better to try that experiment, and\r\nby so doing to maintain union in the Government party, than to divide\r\nit by absolutely disregarding, on this question, M. Camille Jordan,\r\nM. Royer-Collard, and their friends.\r\n\r\nAll power, and, above all, recent power, demands an impression of\r\ngrandeur in its acts and on its insignia. Order, and the regular\r\nprotection of private interests, that daily bread of nations, will not\r\nlong satisfy their wants. To secure these is an inseparable care of\r\nGovernment, but they do not comprise the only need of humanity. Human\r\nnature finds the other enjoyments for which it thirsts in opposite\r\ndistinctions, moral or physical, just or unjust, solid or ephemeral. It\r\nhas neither enough of virtue nor wisdom to render absolute greatness\r\nindispensable; but in every position it requires to see, conspicuously\r\ndisplayed, something exalted, which may attract and occupy the\r\nimagination. After the Empire, which had accustomed France to all the\r\ndelights of national pre-eminence and glory, the spectacle of free and\r\nlofty thought displaying itself with moral dignity, and some show of\r\ntalent, was not deficient in novelty or attraction, while the chance of\r\nits success outweighed the value of the cost.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers were not more skilful in dealing with the personal tempers\r\nthan with the ideas of the doctrinarians, who were as haughty and\r\nindependent in character as they were elevated in mind, and ready to\r\ntake offence when any disposition was evinced to apply their opinions\r\nand conduct without their own consent. Nothing is more distasteful to\r\npower than to admit, to any great extent, the independence of its\r\nsupporters; it considers them treated with sufficient respect if taken\r\ninto confidence, and is readily disposed to view them as servants.\r\nM. Laine, then Minister of the Interior, wrote one morning to M. Cuvier\r\nto say that the King had just named him Royal Commissioner, to second a\r\nbill which would be presented on the following day to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. He had not only neglected to apprise him before of the duty he\r\nwas to undertake, but he did not even mention in the note the particular\r\nbill he instructed him to support. M. Cuvier, more subservient than\r\nsusceptible, with power, made no complaint of this treatment, but\r\nrelated it with a smile. A few days before, the Minister of Finance,\r\nM. Corvetto, had also appointed M. de Serre Commissioner for the defence\r\nof the budget, without asking whether this appointment was agreeable to\r\nhim, or holding any conference even on the fundamental points of the\r\nbudget he was expected to carry through. On receiving notice of this\r\nnomination, M. de Serre felt deeply offended. \"It is either an act of\r\nfolly or impertinence,\" said he loudly; \"perhaps both.\" M. de Serre\r\ndeceived himself; it was neither the one nor the other. M. Corvetto was\r\nan extremely polite, careful, and modest person; but he was of the\r\nImperial school, and more accustomed to give orders to agents than to\r\nconcert measures with members of the Chambers. By habits as well as\r\nideas, the doctrinarians belonged to a liberal system,--troublesome\r\nallies of power, on the termination of a military and administrative\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nI know not which is the most difficult undertaking,--to transform the\r\nfunctionaries of absolute power into the supporters of a free\r\nGovernment, or to organize and discipline the friends of liberty into a\r\npolitical party. If the Ministers sometimes disregarded the humour of\r\nthe doctrinarians, the doctrinarians in their turn too lightly\r\nestimated the position and task of the Ministers. They had in reality,\r\nwhatever has been said of sectarian passions and ideas, neither the\r\nambition nor the vanity of a coterie; they possessed open, generous, and\r\nexpanded minds, extremely accessible to sympathy; but, too much\r\naccustomed to live alone and depend on themselves, they scarcely thought\r\nof the effect which their words and actions produced beyond their own\r\ncircle; and thus social faults were laid to their charge which they had\r\nnot the least desire to commit. Their political mistakes were more real.\r\nIn their relations with power, they were sometimes intemperate and\r\noffensive in language, unnecessarily impatient, not knowing how to be\r\ncontented with what was possible, or how to wait for amelioration\r\nwithout too visible an effort. These causes led them to miscalculate the\r\nimpediments, necessities, and practicable resources of the Government\r\nthey sincerely wished to establish. In the Chambers, they were too\r\nexclusive and pugnacious, more intent on proving their opinions than on\r\ngaining converts, despising rather than desiring recruits, and little\r\ngifted with the talent of attraction and combination so essential to the\r\nleaders of a party. They were not sufficiently acquainted with the\r\ndifficulties of carrying out a sound scheme of policy, nor with the\r\ninfinite variety of efforts, sacrifices, and cares which are comprised\r\nin the art of governing.\r\n\r\nFrom 1816 to 1818 the vices of their position and the mistakes\r\ncommitted, infused into the Government and its party a continual\r\nferment, and the seeds of internal discord which prevented them from\r\nacquiring the necessary strength and consistency. The mischief burst\r\nforth towards the end of 1818, when the Duke de Richelieu returned from\r\nthe conferences of Aix-la-Chapelle, reporting the withdrawal of the\r\nforeign armies, the complete evacuation of our territory, and the\r\ndefinitive settlement of the financial burdens which the Hundred Days\r\nhad imposed on France. On his arrival he saw his Cabinet on the point of\r\ndissolution, and vainly attempted to form a new one, but was finally\r\ncompelled to abandon the power he had never sought or enjoyed, but\r\nwhich, assuredly, he was unwilling to lose by compulsion in the midst of\r\nhis diplomatic triumph, and to see it pass into hands determined to\r\nemploy it in a manner totally opposed to his own intentions.\r\n\r\nA check like this, at such a moment, and to such a man, was singularly\r\nunjust and unseasonable. Since 1815, the Duke de Richelieu had rendered\r\nvaluable services to France and to the King. He alone had obtained some\r\nmitigation to the conditions of a very harsh treaty of peace, which\r\nnothing but sincere and sad devotion had induced him to sign, while\r\nfeeling the full weight of what he sacrificed in attaching to it his\r\nillustrious name, and seeking no self-glorification from an act of\r\nhonest patriotism. No man was ever more free from exaggeration or\r\nquackery in the display of his sentiments. Fifteen months after the\r\nratification of peace, he induced the foreign powers to consent to a\r\nconsiderable reduction in the army of occupation. A year later, he\r\nlimited to a fixed sum the unbounded demands of the foreign creditors of\r\nFrance. Finally, he had just signed the entire emancipation of the\r\nnational soil four years before the term rigorously prescribed by\r\ntreaties. The King, on his return, thanked him in noble words:\r\n\"Duke de Richelieu,\" he said, \"I have lived long enough, since, thanks\r\nto you, I have seen the French flag flying over every town in France.\"\r\nThe sovereigns of Europe treated him with esteem and confidence. A rare\r\nexample of a statesman, who, without great actions or superior\r\nabilities, had, by the uprightness of his character and the unselfish\r\ntenor of his life, achieved such universal and undisputed respect!\r\nAlthough the Duke de Richelieu had only been engaged in foreign affairs,\r\nhe was better calculated than has been said, not so much to direct\r\neffectively as to preside over the internal government of the\r\nRestoration. A nobleman of exalted rank, and a tried Royalist, he was\r\nneither in mind or feeling a courtier nor an Emigrant; he had no\r\npreconceived dislike to the new state of society or the new men; without\r\nthoroughly understanding free institutions, he had no prejudice against\r\nthem, and submitted to their exercise without an effort. Simple in his\r\nmanners, true and steady in his words, and a friend to the public good,\r\nif he failed to exercise a commanding influence in the Chambers, he\r\nmaintained full authority near the King; and a constitutional\r\nGovernment, resting on the parliamentary centre, could not, at that\r\nperiod, have possessed a more worthy or more valuable president.\r\n\r\nBut at the close of 1818 the Duke de Richelieu felt himself compelled,\r\nand evinced that he was resolved, to engage in a struggle in which the\r\nconsiderations of gratitude and prosperity I have here reverted to\r\nproved to be ineffective weapons on his side. In virtue of the Charter,\r\nand in conformity with the electoral law of the 5th of February, 1817,\r\ntwo-fifths of the Chamber of Deputies had been renewed since the\r\nformation of his Cabinet. The first trial of votes, in 1817, had proved\r\nsatisfactory to the Restoration and its friends; not more than two or\r\nthree recognized names were added to the left-hand party, which, even\r\nafter this reinforcement, only amounted to twenty members. At the second\r\ntrial in 1818, the party acquired more numerous and much more\r\ndistinguished recruits; about twenty-five new members, and amongst them\r\nMM. de La Fayette, Benjamin Constant, and Manuel, were enrolled in its\r\nranks. The number was still weak, but important as a rallying point, and\r\nprognostic. An alarm, at once sincere and interested, exhibited itself\r\nat court and in the right-hand party; they found themselves on the eve\r\nof a new revolution, but their hopes were also excited: since the\r\nenemies of the House of Bourbon were forcing themselves into the\r\nChamber, the King would at length feel the necessity of replacing power\r\nin the hands of his friends. The party had not waited the issue of these\r\nlast elections to attempt a great enterprise. _Secret notes_, drawn up\r\nunder the eye of the Count d'Artois, and by his most intimate\r\nconfidants, had been addressed to the foreign sovereigns, to point out\r\nto them this growing mischief, and to convince them that a change in the\r\nadvisers of the crown was the only safe measure to secure monarchy in\r\nFrance, and to preserve peace in Europe. The Duke de Richelieu, in\r\ncommon with his colleagues, and with a feeling of patriotism far\r\nsuperior to personal interest, felt indignant at these appeals to\r\nforeign intervention for the internal government of the country.\r\nM. de Vitrolles was struck off from the Privy Council, as author of the\r\nprincipal of the three _Secret notes_. The European potentates paid\r\nlittle attention to such announcements, having no faith either in the\r\nsound judgment or disinterested views of the men from whom they\r\nemanated. Nevertheless, after the elections of 1818, they also began to\r\nfeel uneasy. It was from prudence, and not choice, that they had\r\nsanctioned and maintained the constitutional system in France; they\r\nlooked upon it as necessary to close up the Revolution. If, on the\r\ncontrary, it once again opened its doors, the peace of Europe would be\r\nmore compromised than ever; for then the Revolution would assume the\r\nsemblance of legality. But neither in France nor in Europe did any one\r\nat that time, even amongst the greatest alarmists and the most\r\nintimidated, dream of interfering with the constitutional system; in\r\nuniversal opinion it had acquired with us the privileges of citizenship.\r\nThe entire evil was imputed to the law of elections. It was at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, while surrounded by the sovereigns and their ministers,\r\nthat the Duke de Richelieu was first apprised of the newly-elected\r\nmembers whom this law had brought upon the scene. The Emperor Alexander\r\nexpressed to him his amazement; the Duke of Wellington advised Louis\r\nXVIII. \"to unite himself more closely with the Royalists.\" The\r\nDuke de Richelieu returned to France with a determination to reform the\r\nelectoral law, or no longer to incur the responsibility of its results.\r\n\r\nInstitutions attacked have no voice in their own defence, and men\r\ngladly charge on them their individual errors. I shall not commit this\r\ninjustice, or abandon a sound idea because it has been compromised or\r\nperverted in application. The principle of the electoral law of the 5th\r\nof February, 1817, was good in itself, and still remains good, although\r\nit was insufficient to prevent the evil of our own want of foresight and\r\nintemperate passions.\r\n\r\nWhen a free government is seriously desired, we must choose between the\r\nprinciple of the law of the 5th of February, 1817, and universal\r\nsuffrage,--between the right of voting confined to the higher classes of\r\nsociety and that extended to the popular masses. I believe the direct\r\nand defined right of suffrage to be alone effectual in securing the\r\naction of the country upon the Government. On this common condition, the\r\ntwo systems may constitute a real control over power, and substantial\r\nguarantees for liberty. Which is to be preferred?--this is a question of\r\nepoch, of situation, of degree of civilization, and of form of\r\ngovernment. Universal suffrage is well suited to republican\r\nassociations, small or federative, newly instituted or mature in wisdom\r\nand political virtue. The right of voting confined to a more elevated\r\nclass, and exercised in a strong assumption of the spirit of order, of\r\nindependence, and intelligence, is more applicable to great single and\r\nmonarchical states. This was our reason for making it the basis of the\r\nlaw of 1817. We dreaded republican tendencies, which with us, and in our\r\ndays, are nearly synonymous with anarchy; we regarded monarchy as\r\nnatural, and constitutional monarchy as necessary, to France; we wished\r\nto organize it sincerely and durably, by securing under this system, to\r\nthe conservative elements of French society as at present constituted,\r\nan influence which appeared to us as much in conformity with the\r\ninterests of liberty as with those of power.\r\n\r\nIt was the disunion of the monarchical party that vitiated the electoral\r\nsystem of 1817, and took away its strength with its truth. By placing\r\npolitical power in the hands of property, intelligence, independent\r\nposition, and great interests naturally conservative, the system rested\r\non the expectation that these interests would be habitually united, and\r\nwould defend, in common accord, order and right against the spirit of\r\nlicense and revolution, the fatal bias of the age. But, from their very\r\nfirst steps, the different elements of the great royalist party, old or\r\nnew, aristocratic or plebeian, plunged into discord, equally blind to\r\nthe weakness with which it infected them all, and thus opening the door\r\nto the hopes and efforts of their common enemies, the revolutionists.\r\nFrom thence, and not from the electoral law of 1817, or from its\r\nprinciple, came the mischief which in 1818 it was considered desirable\r\nto check by repealing that enactment.\r\n\r\nI am ready to admit in express terms, for it may be alleged with\r\njustice, that, when in 1816 and 1817 we prepared and defended the law of\r\nelections, we might have foreseen the state of general feeling under\r\nwhich it was to be applied. Discord between the components of the\r\nmonarchical party was neither a strange nor a sudden fact; it existed at\r\nthat time; the Royalists of old and new France were already widely\r\nseparated. I incline to think that, even had we attached more\r\nimportance to their future contests, we should still have pursued the\r\nsame course. We were in presence of an imperative necessity: new France\r\nfelt that she was attacked, and required defence; if she had not found\r\nsupporters amongst the Royalists, she would have sought for them, as she\r\nhas too often done, in the camp of the Revolution. But what may explain\r\nor even excuse a fault cannot effect its suppression. Our policy in 1816\r\nand 1817 regarded too lightly the disagreements of the monarchical\r\nparty, and the possible return of the Revolutionists; we miscalculated\r\nthe extent of both dangers. It is the besetting error of men\r\nentrammelled in the fetters of party, to forget that there are many\r\nopposite facts which skilful policy should turn to profitable account,\r\nand to pass over all that are not inscribed with brilliancy on their\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Aix-la-Chapelle, where he had been so fortunate, the\r\nDuke de Richelieu, although far from presumptuous, expected, I have no\r\ndoubt, to be equally successful in his design of repealing the law of\r\nelections. Success deceives the most unassuming, and prevents them from\r\nforeseeing an approaching reverse. On his arrival, he found the\r\nundertaking much more difficult than he had anticipated. In the Cabinet,\r\nM. Mole alone fully seconded his intentions. M. Decazes and Marshal\r\nGouvion St. Cyr declared strongly for the law as it stood. M. Laine,\r\nwhile fully admitting that it ought to be modified, refused to take any\r\npart in the matter, having been, as he said, the first to propose and\r\nmaintain it. M. Roy, who had lately superseded M. Corvetto in the\r\ndepartment of finance, cared little for the electoral question, but\r\nannounced that he would not remain in the Cabinet without M. Decazes,\r\nwhom he considered indispensable, either in the Chambers or near the\r\nKing's person. Discord raged within and without the Ministry. In the\r\nChambers, the centre was divided; the left defended the law vehemently;\r\nthe right declared itself ready to support any minister who proposed its\r\nreform, but at the same time repudiated M. Decazes, the author of the\r\ndecree of the 5th of September, 1816, and of all its consequences. The\r\npublic began to warm into the question. Excitement and confusion went on\r\nincreasing. It was evidently not the electoral law alone, but the\r\ngeneral policy of the Restoration and the Government of France, that\r\nformed the subject of debate.\r\n\r\nIn a little work which the historians of this period, M. de Lamartine\r\namongst others, have published, the King, Louis XVIII. himself has\r\nrelated the incidents and sudden turns of this ministerial crisis, which\r\nended, as is well known, in the retirement of the Duke de Richelieu,\r\nwith four of his colleagues, and in the promotion of M. Decazes, who\r\nimmediately constructed a new Cabinet, of which he was the head, without\r\nappearing to preside, while M. de Serre, appointed to the seals, became\r\nthe powerful organ in the Chambers, and the maintenance of the law of\r\nelections was adopted as the symbol. Two sentiments, under simple forms,\r\npervade this kingly recital: first, a certain anxiety, on the part of\r\nthe author, that no blame should be attached to him in his royal\r\ncharacter, or in his conduct towards the Duke de Richelieu, and a desire\r\nto exculpate himself from these charges; secondly, a little of that\r\nsecret pleasure which kings indulge in, even under heavy embarrassments,\r\nwhen they see a minister fall whose importance was not derived from\r\nthemselves, and who has served them without expecting or receiving\r\nfavours.\r\n\r\n\"If I had only consulted my own opinion,\" says the King, in concluding\r\nhis statement, \"I should have wished M. Decazes, uniting his lot, as he\r\nhad always intended, with that of the Duke de Richelieu, to have left\r\nthe Ministry with him.\" It would have been happy for M. Decazes if this\r\ndesire of the King had prevailed. Not that he erred in any point of duty\r\nor propriety by surviving the Duke de Richelieu in office, and in\r\nforming a Cabinet without him; an important misunderstanding on a\r\npressing question had already separated them. M. Decazes, after\r\ntendering his resignation, had raised no obstacle to the Duke's efforts\r\nat finding new colleagues; it was only on the failure of those attempts,\r\nfrankly avowed by the Duke himself, and at the formal request of the\r\nKing, that he had undertaken to form a ministry. As a friend of\r\nM. de Richelieu, and the day before his colleague, there were certainly\r\nunpleasant circumstances and appearances attached to this position; but\r\nM. Decazes was free to act, and could scarcely refuse to carry out the\r\npolicy he had recommended in council, when that which he had opposed\r\nacknowledged itself incapable. Yet the new Cabinet was not strong enough\r\nfor the enterprise it undertook; with the centre completely shaken and\r\ndivided, it had to contend against the right-hand party more irritated\r\nthan ever, and the left evidently inimical, although through decency it\r\nlent to Government a precarious support. The Cabinet of M. Decazes, as\r\na ministerial party, retained much inferior forces to those which had\r\nsurrounded the Duke de Richelieu, and had to contest with two bitter\r\nenemies, the one inaccessible to peace or truce, the other sometimes\r\nappearing friendly, but suddenly turning round and attacking the\r\nMinistry with eager malevolence, when an opportunity offered, and with\r\nhesitating hostility when compelled to dissemble.\r\n\r\nThe doctrinarians, who, in co-operation with M. Decazes, had defended\r\nthe law of elections, energetically supported the new Cabinet, in which\r\nthey were brilliantly represented by M. de Serre. Success was not\r\nwanting at the commencement. By a mild and active administration, by\r\nstudied care of its partisans, by frequent and always favourably\r\nreceived appeals to the royal clemency in behalf of the exiles still\r\nexcepted from amnesty, even including the old regicides, M. Decazes\r\nsought and won extensive popularity; Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr satisfied\r\nthe remnants of the old army, by restoring to the new the ablest of its\r\nformer leaders; M. de Serre triumphantly defended the Ministry in the\r\nChambers; his bills, boldly liberal, and his frank opposition to\r\nrevolutionary principles, soon acquired for him, even with his\r\nadversaries, a just reputation for eloquence and sincerity. In the\r\nparliamentary arena it was an effective and upright Ministry; with the\r\ncountry it was felt to be a Government loyally constitutional. But it\r\nhad more brilliancy than strength; and neither its care of individual\r\ninterests, nor its successes in the tribune, were sufficient to rally\r\nround it the great Government party which its formation had divided.\r\nDiscord arose between the Chambers themselves. The Chamber of Peers, by\r\nadopting the proposition of the Marquis Barthelemy, renewed the struggle\r\nagainst the electoral law. In vain did the Chamber of Deputies repel\r\nthis attack; in vain did the Cabinet, by creating sixty new Peers, break\r\ndown the majority in the palace of the Luxembourg; these half triumphs\r\nand legal extremes decided nothing. Liberal governments are condemned to\r\nsee the great questions perpetually revived which revolutions bequeath\r\nto society, and which even glorious despotism suspends without solving.\r\nThe right-hand party was passionately bent on repossessing the power\r\nwhich had recently escaped them. The left defended, at any cost, the\r\nRevolution, more insulted than in danger. The centre, dislocated and\r\ndoubtful of the future, wavered between the hostile parties, not feeling\r\nitself in a condition to impose peace on all, and on the point of being\r\nconfounded in the ranks of one side or the other. The Cabinet, ever\r\nvictorious in daily debate, and supported by the King's favour, felt\r\nitself nevertheless feebly surrounded and precariously placed, with the\r\nair of expecting a favourable or a hostile incident, to bring the\r\nsecurity it wanted, or to overthrow it altogether.\r\n\r\nThe events which men call accidents are never wanting in such\r\nsituations. During the space of a few months the Cabinet of 1819\r\nexperienced two,--the election of M. Gregoire, and the assassination of\r\nthe Duke de Berry; and these two decided its fate.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to look upon the election of M. Gregoire as an accident;\r\nit was proposed and settled beforehand in the central committee\r\nestablished at Paris to superintend elections in general, and which was\r\ncalled the managing committee. This particular election was decided on\r\nat Grenoble in the college assembled on the 11th of September, 1819, by\r\na certain number of votes of the right-hand party, which at the second\r\nround of balloting were carried to the credit of the left-hand\r\ncandidate, and gave him a majority which otherwise he could not have\r\nobtained. To excuse this scandal, when it became known, some apologists\r\npretended that M. Gregoire was not in fact a regicide, because, even\r\nthough he had approved of the condemnation of Louis XVI. in his letters\r\nto the Convention, his vote at least had not been included in the fatal\r\nlist. Again, when the admission of the deputy was disputed in the\r\nChamber, the left-hand party, to get rid of him, while eluding the true\r\ncause of refusal, eagerly proposed to annul the election on the ground\r\nof irregularity. When improvident violence fails, men gladly shelter\r\nthemselves under pusillanimous subtlety. It was unquestionably in the\r\ncharacter of a Conventional regicide, and with premeditated reflection,\r\nnot by any local or sudden accident, that M. Gregoire had been elected.\r\nNo act was ever more deliberately arranged and accomplished by party\r\nfeelings. Sincere in the perverse extravagancies of his mind, and\r\nfaithful to his avowed principles, although forgetful and weak in their\r\napplication, openly a Christian, and preaching tolerance under the\r\nConvention, while he sanctioned the most unrelenting persecution of the\r\npriests who refused to submit to the yoke of its new church; a\r\nrepublican and oppositionist under the Empire, while consenting to be a\r\nsenator and a Count, this old man, as inconsistent as obstinate, was\r\nthe instrument of a signal act of hostility against the Restoration, to\r\nbecome immediately the pretext for a corresponding act of weakness. A\r\nmelancholy end to a sad career!\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Duke de Berry might with much more propriety be\r\ncalled an accident. On the trial it was proved by evidence that Louvel\r\nhad no accomplices, and that he was alone in the conception as in the\r\nexecution of his crime. But it was also evident that hatred against the\r\nBourbons had possessed the soul and armed the hand of the murderer.\r\nRevolutionary passions are a fire which is kindled and nourished afar\r\noff; the orators of the right obtained credit with many timid and\r\nhorror-stricken minds, when they called this an accident;--as it is also\r\nan accident if a diseased constitution catches the plague when it\r\ninfects the air, or if a powder-magazine explodes when you strike fire\r\nin its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nM. Decazes endeavoured to defend himself against these two heavy blows.\r\nAfter the election of M. Gregoire, he undertook to accomplish alone what\r\nat the close of the preceding year he had refused to attempt in concert\r\nwith the Duke de Richelieu. He determined to alter the law of elections.\r\nIt was intended that this change should take place in a great\r\nconstitutional reform meditated by M. de Serre, liberal on certain\r\npoints, monarchical on others, and which promised to give more firmness\r\nto royalty by developing representative government. M. Decazes made a\r\nsincere effort to induce the Duke de Richelieu, who was then travelling\r\nin Holland, to return and reassume the presidency of the Council, and to\r\nco-operate with him in the Chambers for the furtherance of this bold\r\nundertaking. The King himself applied to the Duke de Richelieu, who\r\npositively declined, more from disgust with public affairs and through\r\ndiffidence of his own power, than from any remains of ill-humour or\r\nresentment. Three actual members of the Cabinet of 1819, General\r\nDessoles, Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, and Baron Louis, declared that they\r\nwould not co-operate in any attack on the existing law of elections.\r\nM. Decazes determined to do without them, as he had dispensed with the\r\nDuke de Richelieu, and to form a new Cabinet, of which he became the\r\npresident, and in which M. Pasquier, General Latour-Maubourg, and M. Roy\r\nreplaced the three retiring ministers. On the 29th of November the King\r\nopened the session. Two months passed over, and the new electoral system\r\nhad not yet been presented to the Chamber. Three days after the\r\nassassination of the Duke de Berry, M. Decazes introduced it suddenly,\r\nwith two bills to suspend personal liberty, and re-establish the\r\ncensorship of the daily press. Four days later he fell, and the\r\nDuke de Richelieu, standing alone before the King and the danger,\r\nconsented to resume power. M. Decazes would have acted more wisely had\r\nhe submitted to his first defeat, and induced the King after the\r\nelection of M. Gregoire, to take back the Duke de Richelieu as minister.\r\nHe would not then have been compelled to lower with his own hand the\r\nflag he had raised, and to endure the burden of a great miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Cabinet of 1819, brought on a new crisis, and a fresh\r\nprogress of the evil which disorganized the great Government party\r\nformed during the session of 1815, and by the decree of the 5th of\r\nSeptember, 1816. To the successive divisions of the centre, were now\r\nadded the differences between the doctrinarians themselves. M. de Serre,\r\nwho had joined the Cabinet with M. Decazes to defend the law of\r\nelections, now determined, although sick and absent, to remain there\r\nwith the Duke de Richelieu to overthrow it, without any of the\r\ncompensations, real or apparent, which his grand schemes of\r\nconstitutional reform were intended to supply. I tried in vain to\r\ndissuade him from his resolution.[15] In the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nM. Royer-Collard and M. Camille Jordan vehemently attacked the new\r\nelectoral plan; the Duke de Broglie and M. de Barante proposed serious\r\namendments to it in the Chamber of Peers. All the political ties which\r\nhad been cemented during five years appeared to be dissolved; every one\r\nfollowed his own private opinion, or returned to his old bias. In the\r\nparliamentary field, all was uncertainty and confused opposition; a\r\nphantom appeared at each extremity, revolution and counter-revolution,\r\nexchanging mutual menaces, and equally impatient to come to issue.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to give themselves a correct idea of parliamentary and\r\npopular excitement, pushed to their extreme limit, and yet retained\r\nwithin that boundary by legal authority and the good sense of the\r\npublic,--sufficient to arrest the country on the brink of an abyss,\r\nalthough too weak to block up the road that leads to it,--should read\r\nthe debate on the new electoral bill introduced into the Chamber of\r\nDeputies on the 17th of April, 1820, by the second Cabinet of the Duke\r\nde Richelieu, and discussed for twenty-six days in that Chamber,\r\naccompanied with riotous gatherings without, thoughtlessly aggressive\r\nand sternly repressed. If we are to believe the orators of the left,\r\nFrance and her liberties, the Revolution and its conquests, the honour\r\nof the present, and the security of the future, were all lost if the\r\nministerial bill should pass. The right, on the other hand, looked upon\r\nthe bill as scarcely strong enough to save the monarchy for the moment,\r\nand declared its resolution to reject every amendment which might\r\ndiminish its powers. On both sides, pretensions and claims were equally\r\nungovernable. Attracted and excited by this legal quarrel, the students,\r\nthe enthusiastic young Liberals, the old professional disturbers, the\r\nidlers and oppositionists of every class, were engaged daily with the\r\nsoldiers and the agents of police, in conflicts sometimes sanguinary,\r\nand the accounts of which redoubled the acrimony of the debate\r\nwithindoors. In the midst of this general commotion, the Cabinet of 1820\r\nhad the merit of maintaining, while repressing all popular movement, the\r\nfreedom of legislative deliberation, and of acting its part in these\r\nstormy discussions with perseverance and moderation. M. Pasquier, their\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, endowed with rare self-command and\r\npresence of mind, was on this occasion the principal parliamentary\r\nchampion of the Cabinet; and M. Mounier, Director-General of the\r\nPolice, controlled the street riots with as much prudence as active\r\nfirmness. The charge so often brought against so many ministers, against\r\nM. Casimir Perrier in 1831, as against the Duke de Richelieu in 1820, of\r\nexciting popular commotions only to repress them, does not deserve the\r\nnotice of sensible men. At the end of a month, all these debates and\r\nscenes, within and without, ended in the adoption, not of the\r\nministerial bill, but of an amendment which, without destroying in\r\nprinciple the bill of the 5th of February, 1817, so materially vitiated\r\nit, to the advantage of the right, that the party felt themselves bound\r\nto be satisfied. The greater portion of the centre, and the more\r\nmoderate members of the left, submitted for the sake of public\r\npeace. The extreme left and the extreme right, M. Manuel and\r\nM. de la Bourdonnaye entered a protest. The new electoral system was\r\nclearly destined to shift the majority, and, with the majority, power,\r\nfrom the left to the right; but the liberties of France, and the\r\nadvantages gained by the Revolution, were not endangered by the change.\r\n\r\nThis question once settled, the Cabinet had to pay its debts to the\r\nright-hand party,--rewards to those who had supported it, and\r\npunishments to its opposers. In spite of old friendships, the\r\ndoctrinarians figured of necessity in the last category. If I had\r\ndesired it, I might have escaped. Not being a member of either Chamber,\r\nand beyond the circle of constrained action, I could in my capacity of\r\nState Councillor have maintained reserve and silence after giving my\r\nadvice to the Government; but on entering public life, I had resolved on\r\none uniform course,--to express my true thoughts on every occasion, and\r\nnever to separate myself from my friends. M. de Serre included me, with\r\ngood reason, in the measure which removed them from the Council; on the\r\n17th of June, 1820, he wrote to MM. Royer-Collard, Camille Jordan,\r\nBarante, and myself, to inform us that we were no longer on the list.\r\nThe best men readily assume the habits and style of absolute power.\r\nM. de Serre was certainly not deficient in self-respect or confidence in\r\nhis own opinions; he felt surprised that in this instance I should have\r\nobeyed mine, without any other more coercive necessity, and evinced this\r\nfeeling by communicating my removal with unqualified harshness. \"The\r\nevident hostility,\" he said to me, \"which, without the shadow of a\r\npretext, you have lately exhibited towards the King's Government, has\r\nrendered this step inevitable.\" My answer was simply this:--\"I expected\r\nyour letter. I might have foreseen, and I did anticipate it, when I\r\nopenly evinced my disapprobation of the acts and speeches of the\r\nMinistry. I congratulate myself that I have nothing to alter in my\r\nconduct. Tomorrow, as yesterday, I shall belong only and entirely to\r\nmyself.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe decisive step was taken; power had changed its course with its\r\nfriends. After having turned it to this new direction, the\r\nDuke de Richelieu and his colleagues made sincere efforts during two\r\nyears to arrest its further progress. They tried all methods of\r\nconciliation or resistance; sometimes they courted the right, at others\r\nthe remains of the centre, and occasionally even the left, by\r\nconcessions of principle, and more frequently of a personal nature.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was sent as Ambassador to Berlin, and General\r\nClauzel was declared entitled to the amnesty. M. de Villele and\r\nM. Corbiere obtained seats in the Cabinet, the first as minister without\r\na portfolio, and the other as president of the Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction; they left it, however, at the expiration of six months,\r\nunder frivolous pretexts, but foreseeing the approaching fall of the\r\nMinistry, and not wishing to be there at the last moment. They were not\r\ndeceived. The elections of 1821 completed the decimation of the weak\r\nbattalion which still endeavoured to stand firm round tottering power.\r\nThe Duke de Richelieu, who had only resumed office on a personal promise\r\nfrom the Count d'Artois of permanent support, complained loudly, with\r\nthe independent spirit of a nobleman of high rank and of a man of\r\nhonour, that the word of a gentleman, pledged to him, had not been kept.\r\nVain complaints, and futile efforts! The Cabinet obtained time with\r\ndifficulty; but the right-hand party alone gained ground. At length, on\r\nthe 19th of December, 1821, the last shadow of the Government of the\r\nCentre vanished with the ministry of the Duke de Richelieu. The right\r\nand M. de Villele seized the reins of power. \"The counter-revolution is\r\napproaching!\" exclaimed the left, in a mingled burst of satisfaction and\r\nalarm. M. de Villele thought differently; a little before the decisive\r\ncrisis, and after having, in his quality of vice-president, directed for\r\nsome days the deliberations of the Chamber of Deputies, he wrote as\r\nfollows to one of his friends:--\"You will scarcely believe how my four\r\ndays of presidency have succeeded. I received compliments on every side,\r\nbut particularly, I own it to my shame, from the left, whom I have never\r\nconciliated. They expected, without doubt, to be eaten up alive by an\r\n_ultra_. They are inexhaustible in eulogium. Finally, those to whom I\r\nnever speak, now address me with a thousand compliments. I think in this\r\nthere is a little spite against M. Ravez. But, be that as it may, if a\r\npresident were just now to be elected, I should have almost every vote\r\nin the Chamber.... For myself, impartiality costs me nothing. I look\r\nonly to the success of the affairs I have undertaken, and have not the\r\nslightest prejudice against individuals. I am born for the end of\r\nrevolutions.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: I have recapitulated amongst the \"Historic Documents\" the\r\nchief measures of general administration, which were adopted by\r\nM.

It was no longer as an actor\r\nwithin, but as a spectator without, that I watched the right-hand party,\r\nand am enabled to record my impressions,--a spectator in opposition,\r\nwho has acquired light, and learned to form a correct judgment, from\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn December 1821, M. de Villele attained power by the natural highroad.\r\nHe reached his post through the qualities he had displayed and the\r\nimportance he had acquired in the Chambers, and at the head of his\r\nparty, which he brought in with himself. After a struggle of five years,\r\nhe accomplished the object prematurely conceived by M. de Vitrolles in\r\n1815,--that the leader of the parliamentary majority should become the\r\nhead of the Government. Events are marked by unforeseen contradictions.\r\nThe Charter conducted to office the very individual who, before its\r\npromulgation, had been its earliest opponent.\r\n\r\nAmongst the noted men of our time, it is a distinctive feature in the\r\ncareer of M. de Villele, that he became minister as a partisan, and\r\nretained that character in his official position, while at the same time\r\nendeavouring to establish, amongst his supporters, general principles of\r\ngovernment in preference to the spirit of party. This moderator of the\r\nright was ever strictly faithful to the interests of that side. Very\r\noften unacquainted with the ideas, passions, and designs of his party,\r\nhe opposed them indirectly and without positive disavowal, resolved\r\nnever to desert his friends, even though he might be unable to control\r\ntheir course. Not from any general and systematic conviction, but from a\r\nsound practical instinct, he readily perceived the necessity of a strong\r\nattachment from the leader to his army, to secure a reciprocal feeling\r\nfrom the army to its chief. He paid dearly for this pertinacity; for it\r\njustly condemned him to bear the weight of errors which, had he been\r\nunfettered, he would never in all probability have committed; but\r\nthrough this sacrifice he held power for six years, and saved his party,\r\nduring that period, from the extreme mistakes which, after his\r\nsecession, led rapidly to their ruin. As minister of a constitutional\r\nmonarchy, M. de Villele has furnished France with one of the first\r\nexamples of that fixity of political ties which, in spite of many\r\ninconveniences and objections, is essential to the great and salutary\r\neffects of representative government.\r\n\r\nWhen M. de Villele was called on to form a Cabinet, he found the country\r\nand the Government under the influence of a violent excitement. There\r\nwere not alone storms in the Chamber and tumults in the streets; secret\r\nsocieties, plots, insurrections, and a strong effort to overthrow\r\nestablished order, fermented and burst forth in every quarter,--in the\r\ndepartments of the east, west, and south, at Befort, Colmar, Toulon,\r\nSaumur, Nantes, La Rochelle, and even at Paris itself, under the very\r\neyes of the Ministers, in the army as well as in the civil professions,\r\nin the royal guards as in the regiments of the line. In less than three\r\nyears, eight serious conspiracies attacked and endangered the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nToday, after the lapse of more than thirty years, after so many events\r\nof greater importance, when an honest and rational man asks himself what\r\nmotives could have excited such fierce anger and rash enterprises, he\r\ncan find none either sufficient or legitimate. Neither the acts of power\r\nnor the probabilities of the future had so wounded or threatened the\r\nrights and interests of the country as to justify these attempts at\r\nutter subversion. The electoral system had been artfully changed; power\r\nhad passed into the hands of an irritating and suspected party; but the\r\ngreat institutions were still intact; public liberty, though disputed,\r\nstill displayed itself vigorously; legal order had received no serious\r\nblow; the country prospered and regularly advanced in strength. The new\r\nsociety was disturbed, but not disarmed; it was in a condition to wait\r\nand defend itself. There were just grounds for an animated and public\r\nopposition, but none for conspiracy or revolution.\r\n\r\nNations that aspire to be free incur a prominent danger,--the danger of\r\ndeceiving themselves on the question of tyranny. They readily apply that\r\nname to any system of government that displeases or alarms them, or\r\nrefuses to grant all that they desire. Frivolous caprices, which entail\r\ntheir own punishment! Power must have inflicted on a country many\r\nviolations of right, with repeated acts of injustice and oppression\r\nbitter and prolonged, before revolution can be justified by reason, or\r\ncrowned with triumph in the face of its inherent faults. When such\r\ncauses are wanting to revolutionary attempts, they either fail miserably\r\nor bring with them the reaction which involves their own punishment.\r\n\r\nBut from 1820 to 1823 the conspirators never dreamed of asking\r\nthemselves if their enterprises were legitimate; they entertained no\r\ndoubt on the subject. Very different although simultaneous passions,\r\npast alarms and prospective temptations, influenced their minds and\r\nconduct. The hatreds and apprehensions that attached themselves to the\r\nwords emigration, feudal system, old form of government, aristocracy,\r\nand counter-revolution, belonged to bygone times; but these fears and\r\nantipathies were in many hearts as intense and vivid as if they were\r\nentertained towards existing and powerful enemies. Against these\r\nphantoms, which the folly of the extreme right had conjured up, without\r\nthe power of giving them substantial vitality, war in any shape was\r\nconsidered allowable, urgent, and patriotic. It was believed that\r\nliberty could best be served and saved by rekindling against the\r\nRestoration all the slumbering revolutionary fires. The conspirators\r\nflattered themselves that they could at the same time prepare a fresh\r\nrevolution, which should put an end, not only to the restored monarchy,\r\nbut to monarchy altogether, and by the re-establishment of the Republic\r\nlead to the absolute triumph of popular rights and interests. To the\r\ngreater part of these young enthusiasts, descended from families who had\r\nbeen engaged in the old cause of the first Revolution, dreams of the\r\nfuture united with traditions of the domestic hearth; while maintaining\r\nthe struggles of their fathers, they indulged their own Utopian\r\nchimeras.\r\n\r\nThose who conspired from revolutionary hatred or republican hope, were\r\njoined by others with more clearly defined but not less impassioned\r\nviews. I have elsewhere said, in speaking of Washington, \"It is the\r\nprivilege, often corruptive, of great men, to inspire attachment and\r\ndevotion without the power of reciprocating these feelings.\" No one ever\r\nenjoyed this privilege more than the Emperor Napoleon. He was dying at\r\nthis very moment upon the rock of St. Helena; he could no longer do\r\nanything for his partisans; and he found, amongst the people as well as\r\nin the army, hearts and arms ready to do all and risk all for his\r\nname,--a generous infatuation for which I am at a loss to decide whether\r\nhuman nature should be praised or pitied.\r\n\r\nAll these passions and combinations would in all probability have\r\nremained futile and unnoticed, had they not found exponents and chiefs\r\nin the highest political circles and in the bosom of the great bodies of\r\nthe State. The popular masses are never sufficient for themselves; their\r\ndesires and designs must be represented by visible and important\r\nleaders, who march at their head and accept the responsibility of the\r\nmeans and end. The conspirators of from 1820 to 1823 knew this well; and\r\nupon the most widely separated points, at Befort as at Saumur, and at\r\neach fresh enterprise, they declared that they would not act unless\r\nwell-known political leaders and Deputies of reputation were associated\r\nwith them. Everybody knows, at the present day, that the co-operation\r\nthey required was not withheld.\r\n\r\nIn the Chamber of Deputies, the opposition to the Government of the\r\nRight was comprised of three sections united against it, but differing\r\nmaterially in their views and in their means of hostility. I shall only\r\nname the principal members of this confederacy, and who have themselves\r\nclearly defined their respective positions. M. de La Fayette and\r\nM. Manuel acknowledged and directed the conspiracies. Without ignoring\r\nthem, General Foy, M. Benjamin Constant, and M. Casimir Perrier,\r\ndisapproved of their proceedings and declined association.\r\nM. Royer-Collard and his friends were absolutely unacquainted with them,\r\nand stood entirely aloof.\r\n\r\nWhen my thoughts revert to M. de La Fayette, I am saddened by\r\naffectionate regret. I never knew a character more uniformly sincere,\r\ngenerous, and kind, or more ready to risk everything for his pledged\r\nfaith and cause; his benevolence, although rather indiscriminate in\r\nparticular cases, was not the less true and expanded towards humanity in\r\ngeneral. His courage and devotedness were natural and earnest, serious\r\nunder an exterior sometimes light, and as genuine as they were\r\nspontaneous. Throughout his life he maintained consistency in sentiments\r\nand ideas; and he had his days of vigorous resolution, which would have\r\nreflected honour on the truest friend of order and resistance to\r\nanarchy. In 1791, he opened fire, in the Champ de Mars, on the revolt\r\nset up in the name of the people; in 1792, he came in person to demand,\r\non behalf of his army, the suppression of the Jacobins; and he held\r\nhimself apart and independent under the Empire. But, taking all points\r\ninto account, he failed in political judgment, in discernment, in a just\r\nestimate of circumstances and men; and he had a yielding towards his\r\nnatural bent, a want of foresight as to the probable results of his\r\nactions, with a constant but indistinct yearning after popular favour,\r\nwhich led him on much further than he intended, and subjected him to the\r\ninfluence of men of a very inferior order, directly against his moral\r\nnature and political situation. At the first moment, in 1814, he seemed\r\nto be well disposed towards the Restoration; but the tendencies of\r\npower, and the persevering rancour of the Royalists, soon threw him back\r\ninto the ranks of opposition. At the close of the Hundred Days, his\r\nhostility to the House of Bourbon became declared and active; a\r\nrepublican in soul, without being sufficiently strong or daring to\r\nproclaim the Republic, he opposed as obstinately as vainly the return of\r\nroyalty; and before the Chamber of 1815, excited but not dismayed, he\r\npledged himself, while the Restoration lasted, to enter and never to\r\ndesert the ranks of its most inveterate enemies. From 1820 to 1823 he\r\nwas, not the ostensible head, but the instrument and ornament, of every\r\nsecret society, of every plot and project of revolution; even of those\r\nthe results of which he would inevitably have denounced and resisted,\r\nhad they been crowned with success.\r\n\r\nNo two people could less resemble each other than M. Manuel and M. de La\r\nFayette. While one was open, improvident, and rash in his hostility, the\r\nother was in an equal degree reserved, calculating, and prudent even in\r\nhis violence, although in real character bold and determined. M. de La\r\nFayette was not exactly a high and mighty lord,--that expression does\r\nnot apply to him,--but a noble gentleman, liberal and popular, not\r\nnaturally a revolutionist, but one who by enthusiasm or example might be\r\nled and would himself lead to repeated revolutions. M. Manuel was the\r\nobedient child and able defender of the past revolution, capable of\r\njoining Government for its interest--a liberal Government, if animated\r\nwith revolutionary objects, an absolute Government if unlimited power\r\nshould be necessary to their supremacy,--but determined to uphold\r\nrevolution in every case and at any price. His mind was limited and\r\nuncultivated, and, either in his general life or in parliamentary\r\ndebate, without any impress of great political views, or of sympathetic\r\nor lofty emotions of the soul, beyond the firmness of his attitude and\r\nthe lucid strength of his language. Although no advocate, and a little\r\nprovincial in his style, he spoke and acted as a man of party, calmly\r\npersevering and resolved, immovable in the old revolutionary arena, and\r\nnever disposed to leave it either to become a convert to new measures or\r\nto adopt new views. The Restoration, in his opinion, was in fact the old\r\nsystem and the counter-revolution. After having confronted it in the\r\nChambers with all the opposition which that theatre permitted, he\r\nencouraged, without, every plot and effort of subversion; less ready\r\nthan M. de La Fayette to place himself at their head, less confident in\r\ntheir success, but still determined to keep alive by these means hatred\r\nand war against the Restoration, watching at the same time for a\r\nfavourable opportunity of launching a decisive blow.\r\n\r\nM. d'Argenson had less weight with the party than either of his\r\ncolleagues, although perhaps the most impassioned of the three. He was a\r\nsincere and melancholy visionary, convinced that all social evils spring\r\nfrom human laws, and bent on promoting every kind of reform, although he\r\nhad little confidence in the reformers. By his position in society, the\r\ngenerous tone of his sentiments, the seriousness of his convictions, the\r\nattraction of an affectionate although reserved disposition, and the\r\ncharm of a refined and elegant mind, which extracted from his false\r\nphilosophy bold and original views, he held, in the projects and\r\npreliminary deliberations of the conspiring opposition, a tolerably\r\nimportant place; but he was little suited for action, and ready to\r\ndiscourage it, although always prepared for personal engagement. A\r\nchimerical but not hopeful fanaticism is not a very promising\r\ntemperament for a conspirator.\r\n\r\nThe issue of all these vain but tragical plots is well known. Dogged at\r\nevery step by authority, sometimes even persecuted by the interested\r\nzeal of unworthy agents, they produced, in the space of two years, in\r\nvarious parts of France, nineteen capital condemnations, eleven of which\r\nwere carried into effect. When we look back on these gloomy scenes, the\r\nmind is bewildered, and the heart recoils from the spectacle of the\r\ncontrast which presents itself between sentiments and actions, efforts\r\nand results; we contemplate enterprises at the same time serious and\r\nharebrained, patriotic ardour joined to moral levity, enthusiastic\r\ndevotion combined with indifferent calculation, and the same blindness,\r\nthe same perseverance, united to similar impotence in old and young, in\r\nthe generals and the soldiers. On the 1st of January, 1822, M. de La\r\nFayette arrived in the vicinity of Befort to place himself at the head\r\nof the insurrection in Alsace. He found the plot discovered, and several\r\nof the leaders already in arrest; but he also met others, MM. Ary\r\nScheffer, Joubert, Carrel, and Guinard, whose principal anxiety was to\r\nmeet and warn him by the earliest notice, and to save him and his son\r\n(who accompanied him) by leading them away through unfrequented roads.\r\nNine months later, on the 21st of September in the same year, four young\r\nnon-commissioned officers, Bories, Raoulx, Goubin, and Pommier,\r\ncondemned to death for the conspiracy of Rochelle, were on the point of\r\nundergoing their sentence; M. de La Fayette and the head committee of\r\nthe _Carbonari_ had vainly endeavoured to effect their escape. The poor\r\nsergeants knew they were lost, and had reason to think they were\r\nabandoned. A humane magistrate urged them to save their lives by giving\r\nup the authors of their fatal enterprise. All four answered, \"We have\r\nnothing to reveal,\" and then remained obstinately silent. Such devotion\r\nmerited more thoughtful leaders and more generous enemies.\r\n\r\nIn presence of such facts, and in the midst of the warm debates they\r\nexcited in the Chamber, the situation of the conspiring Deputies was\r\nawkward; they neither avowed their deeds nor supported their friends.\r\nThe violence of their attacks against the Ministry and the Restoration\r\nin general, supplied but a poor apology for this weakness. Secret\r\nassociations and plots accord ill with a system of liberty; there is\r\nlittle sense or dignity in conspiring and arguing at the same time. It\r\nwas in vain that the Deputies who were not implicated endeavoured to\r\nshield their committed and embarrassed colleagues; it was in vain that\r\nGeneral Foy, M. Casimir Perrier, M. Benjamin Constant, and M. Lafitte,\r\nwhile protesting with vehemence against the accusations charged upon\r\ntheir party, endeavoured to cast the mantle of their personal innocence\r\nover the actual conspirators, who sat by their sides. This manoeuvre,\r\nmore blustering than formidable, deceived neither the Government nor the\r\npublic; and the conspiring Deputies lost more reputation than they\r\ngained security, by being thus defended while they were disavowed, in\r\ntheir own ranks. M. de La Fayette became impatient of this doubtful and\r\nunworthy position. During the sitting of the 1st of August, 1822, with\r\nreference to the debate on the budget, M. Benjamin Constant complained\r\nof a phrase in the act of accusation drawn up by the Attorney-General of\r\nPoictiers, against the conspiracy of General Berton, and in which the\r\nnames of five Deputies were included without their being prosecuted.\r\nM. Lafitte sharply called upon the Chamber to order an inquiry into\r\ntransactions \"which,\" said he, \"as far as they affect myself are\r\ninfamous falsehoods.\" M. Casimir Perrier and General Foy supported the\r\nmotion for inquiry. The Cabinet and the right-hand party rejected it,\r\nwhile defending the Attorney-General and his statements. The Chamber\r\nappeared perplexed. M. de La Fayette demanded to be heard, and, with a\r\nrare and happy expression of ironical pride, said, \"Whatever may be my\r\nhabitual indifference to party accusations and enmities, I feel called\r\nupon to add a few words to what has been said by my honourable friends.\r\nThroughout the course of a career entirely devoted to the cause of\r\nliberty, I have constantly desired to be a mark for the malevolence of\r\nthe adversaries of that cause, under whatever forms, whether despotic,\r\naristocratic, or monarchical, which they may please to select, to\r\ncontest or pervert it. I therefore make no complaint, although I may\r\nclaim the right of considering the word _proved_, which the\r\nAttorney-General has thought proper to apply to me, a little free; but I\r\njoin with my friends by demanding, as far as we can, the utmost\r\npublicity, both within the walls of this Chamber and in the face of the\r\nentire nation. Thus I and my accusers, in whatever rank they may be\r\nplaced, can say to each other, without restraint, all that we have had\r\nmutually to reproach ourselves with during the last thirty years.\"\r\n\r\nThe challenge was as transparent as it was fierce. M. de Villele felt\r\nthe full range of it, which extended even to the King himself; and\r\ntaking up the glove at once, with a moderation which in its turn was not\r\ndeficient in dignity, \"The orator I follow,\" said he, \"placed the\r\nquestion on its true footing when he said, in speaking of the Chamber,\r\n'as far as we can.' Yes, it is of the utmost importance that, on the\r\nsubject under discussion, the truth or falsehood should be correctly\r\nknown; but do we adopt the true method of ascertaining either? Such is\r\nnot my opinion; if it were, I should at once vote for the inquiry. The\r\nproper mode of proceeding appears to me to be, to leave justice to its\r\nordinary course, which no one has a right to arrest.... If members of\r\nthis Chamber have been compromised in the act of accusation, do they not\r\nfind their acquittal in the very fact that the Chamber has not been\r\ncalled upon to give them up to be added to the list of the accused? For,\r\ngentlemen, it is maintaining a contradiction to say, on the one hand,\r\n'You have placed our names in the requisition for indictment,' and on\r\nthe other, 'The minister in office has not dared to prosecute, since the\r\nChamber has not been required to surrender us.' And the demand has not\r\nbeen made, because the nature of the process neither imposed it as a\r\nduty nor a necessity on the part of the minister to adopt that course. I\r\ndeclare openly, before France, we do not accuse you, because there was\r\nnothing in the process which rendered it either incumbent or essential\r\nthat we should do so. And we should the more readily have fulfilled that\r\nduty, since you cannot suppose us so little acquainted with the human\r\nheart as not to know that there would be less danger in subjecting you\r\nto direct prosecution than in following simply and openly the line\r\nmarked out by the ordinary course of justice.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this sitting, M. de Villele assuredly had good reason to\r\nbe satisfied with his position and himself. He had exhibited, at the\r\nsame time, firmness and moderation; by confining himself within the\r\nordinary resources of justice, by disclaiming prosecution to extremity,\r\nhe had exhibited the arm of power restrained, but ready to strike if\r\nnecessity should require; he had thus, to a certain extent, defied while\r\nhe tranquillized the patrons of the conspirators, and had satisfied his\r\nown party without irritating their passions. On that day he combined the\r\nminister with the tactician of the Chamber.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we are speaking, M. de Villele stood in the first\r\nand best phase of his power; he defended monarchy and order against\r\nconspiracy and insurrection; in the Chamber of Deputies he had to repel\r\nthe furious attacks of the left-hand party, and in the Chamber of Peers\r\nthe more temperate but vigilant illwill of the friends of the\r\nDuke de Richelieu. The danger and acrimony of the contest united his\r\nwhole party around him. Before such a situation, the rivalries and\r\nintrigues of the Chamber and the Court hesitated to show themselves;\r\nunreasonable expectations were held in check; fidelity and discipline\r\nwere evidently necessary; the associates of the chief could not desert,\r\nand dared not to assail him with their importunities.\r\n\r\nBut during the course of the year 1822 the conspiracies were subdued,\r\nthe perils of the monarchy dissipated, the parliamentary combats,\r\nalthough always bitter, had ceased to be questions of life and death,\r\nand the preponderance of the right-hand party appeared to be firmly\r\nestablished in the country as in the Chambers. Other difficulties and\r\ndangers then began to rise up round M. de Villele. He had no longer\r\nmenacing enemies to hold his friends in check; disagreements, demands,\r\nenmities, and intrigues beset him on every side. The first attacks\r\nsprang from questions of internal policy, and originated in the bosom of\r\nhis own Cabinet.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to pronounce severe judgment on the revolutions which\r\nagitated Southern Europe from 1820 to 1822. It is hard to say to nations\r\nbadly governed, that they are neither wise nor strong enough to remedy\r\ntheir own evils. Above all, in our days, when the desire for good\r\ngovernment is intense, and none believe themselves too weak to\r\naccomplish what they wish, unrestrained truth on this subject offends\r\nmany sincere friends of justice and humanity. Experience, however, has\r\nsupplied numerous inferences. Of the three revolutions which occurred in\r\n1820, those of Naples and Turin evaporated in a few months, without any\r\nblow being struck, before the sole appearance of the Austrian troops.\r\nThe Spanish revolution alone survived, neither abandoned nor\r\nestablished, pursuing its course by violent but uncertain steps,\r\nincapable of founding a regular government and of suppressing the\r\nresistance with which it was opposed, but still strong enough to keep\r\nalive anarchy and civil war. Spain, under the influence of such\r\ncommotions, was a troublesome neighbour to France, and might become\r\ndangerous. The conspirators, defeated at home, found shelter there, and\r\nbegan to weave new plots from that place of refuge. In their turn, the\r\nSpanish counter-revolutionists found an asylum in France, and prepared\r\narms on both sides of the Pyrenees. A sanatory line of troops, stationed\r\non our frontier to preserve France from the contagion of the\r\nyellow-fever which had broken out in Catalonia, soon grew into an army\r\nof observation. The hostile feeling of Europe, much more decided and\r\nsystematic, co-operated with the mistrust of France. Prince Metternich\r\ndreaded a new fit of Spanish revolutionary contagion in Italy; the\r\nEmperor Alexander imagined himself called upon to maintain the security\r\nof all thrones and the peace of the world; England, without caring much\r\nfor the success of the Spanish revolution, was extremely anxious that\r\nSpain should continue entirely independent, and that French influence\r\nshould not prevail in the Peninsula. The French Government had to deal\r\nwith a question not only delicate and weighty in itself, but abounding\r\nwith still more important complications, and which might lead to a\r\nrupture with some, if not with the whole of her allies.\r\n\r\nM. de Villele on succeeding to office, had no very defined ideas as to\r\nforeign affairs, or any decidedly arranged plans beyond an unbiassed\r\nmind and sensible predilections. During his short association with the\r\nCabinet of the Duke de Richelieu, he had closely observed the policy\r\nadopted towards Spain and Italy,--a peaceful policy of non-intervention,\r\nand of sound advice to kings and liberals, to liberals as to kings, but\r\nof little efficacy in act, and tending, above all other considerations,\r\nto keep France beyond the vortex of revolutions and counter-revolutions,\r\nand to prevent a European conflagration. In the main, M. de Villele\r\napproved of this policy, and would have desired nothing better than to\r\ncontinue it. He was more occupied with internal government than external\r\nrelations, and more anxious for public prosperity than diplomatic\r\ninfluence; but, in the accomplishment of his views, he had to contend\r\nagainst the prepossessions of his party, and in this struggle his two\r\nprincipal associates, M. de Montmorency, as Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and M. de Chateaubriand, as ambassador at London, contributed\r\nmore embarrassment than assistance.\r\n\r\nOn the formation of the Cabinet, he proposed to the King to give\r\nM. de Montmorency the portfolio of foreign affairs. \"Take care,\" replied\r\nLouis XVIII. \"He has a very little mind, somewhat prejudiced and\r\nobstinate; he will betray you, against his will, through weakness. When\r\npresent, he will say he agrees with you, and may perhaps think so at the\r\ntime; when he leaves you, he will suffer himself to be led by his own\r\nbias, contrary to your views, and, instead of being aided, you will be\r\nthwarted and compromised.\" M. de Villele persevered; he believed that,\r\nwith the right-hand party, the name and influence of M. de Montmorency\r\nwere of importance. Not long after, he had an opportunity of satisfying\r\nhimself that the King had judged correctly. M. de Serre having refused\r\nto hold office in the new Cabinet, M. de Villele, to remove him with the\r\nsemblance of a compliment, requested the King to appoint him ambassador\r\nat Naples. M. de Montmorency, who wanted this post for his cousin the\r\nDuke de Laval, went so far as to say that he should resign if it were\r\nrefused to him. The King and M. de Villele kept their resolution;\r\nM. de Serre went to Naples, and M. de Montmorency remained in the\r\nMinistry, but not without discontent at the preponderance of a colleague\r\nwho had treated him with so little complaisance.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, by accepting the embassy to London, relieved\r\nM. de Villele from many little daily annoyances; but he was not long\r\nsatisfied with his new post. He wished to reign in a coterie, and to\r\nreceive adulation without constraint. He produced less effect in English\r\nsociety than he had anticipated; he wanted more success and of a more\r\nvaried character; he was looked upon as a distinguished writer, rather\r\nthan as a great politician; they considered him more opinionated than\r\nprofound, and too much occupied with himself. He excited curiosity, but\r\nnot the admiration he coveted; he was not always the leading object of\r\nattention, and enjoyed less freedom, while he called forth little of the\r\nenthusiastic idolatry to which he had been accustomed elsewhere. London,\r\nthe English court and drawing-rooms, wearied and displeased him; he has\r\nperpetuated the impression in his Memoirs:--\"Every kind of reputation,\"\r\nhe says, \"travels rapidly to the banks of the Thames, and leaves them\r\nagain with the same speed. I should have worried myself to no purpose by\r\nendeavouring to acquire any knowledge of the English. What a life is a\r\nLondon season! I should prefer the galleys a hundred times.\"\r\n\r\nAn opportunity soon presented itself, which enabled him to seek in\r\nanother direction more worldly excitement and popularity. Revolution and\r\ncivil war went on increasing in Spain from day to day; tumults, murders,\r\nsanguinary combats between the people and the royal guards, the troops\r\nof the line and the militia, multiplied in the streets of Madrid. The\r\nlife of Ferdinand VII. appeared to be in question, and his liberty was\r\nactually invaded.\r\n\r\nM. de Metternich, whose importance and influence in Europe had greatly\r\nincreased ever since he had so correctly foreseen the weakness, and so\r\nrapidly stifled the explosion, of the Italian revolutions, applied his\r\nentire attention to the affairs of the Spanish Peninsula, and urged the\r\nsovereigns and their ministers to deliberate on them in common accord.\r\nAs soon as it was settled that a Congress should assemble with this\r\nobject, at Verona, M. de Chateaubriand made powerful applications,\r\ndirectly and indirectly, to M. de Montmorency and M. de Villele, to be\r\nincluded in the mission. M. de Montmorency had no idea of acceding to\r\nthis, fearing to be opposed or eclipsed by such a colleague. The King,\r\nLouis XVIII., who had no confidence either in the capacity of\r\nM. de Montmorency or the judgment of M. de Chateaubriand, was desirous\r\nthat M. de Villele himself should repair to Verona, to maintain the\r\nprudent policy which circumstances required. M. de Villele objected. It\r\nwould be, he said to the King, too decided an affront to his minister of\r\nforeign affairs and his ambassador in London, who were naturally called\r\nto this duty; it would be better to send them both, that one might\r\ncontrol the other, and to give them specific instructions which should\r\nregulate their attitude and language. The King adopted this advice. The\r\ninstructions, drawn up by M. de Villele's own hand, were discussed and\r\nsettled in a solemn meeting of the Cabinet; M. de Chateaubriand knew to\r\na certainty that he owed the accomplishment of his desires to\r\nM. de Villele alone; and eight days after the departure of\r\nM. de Montmorency, the King, to secure the preponderance of\r\nM. de Villele, by a signal mark of favour, appointed him President of\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\nThe instructions were strictly defined; they prescribed to the French\r\nplenipotentiaries to abstain from appearing, when before the Congress,\r\nas reporters of the affairs of Spain, to take no initiative and enter\r\ninto engagement as regarded intervention, and, in every case, to\r\npreserve the total independence of France, either as to act or future\r\nresolve. But the inclinations of M. de Montmorency accorded ill with his\r\norders; and he had to treat with sovereigns and ministers who wished\r\nprecisely to repress the Spanish revolution by the hand of France,--in\r\nthe first place, to accomplish this work without taking it upon\r\nthemselves, and also to compromise France with England, who was\r\nevidently much averse to French interference. The Prince de Metternich,\r\nversed in the art of suggesting to others his own views, and of urging\r\nwith the air of co-operation, easily obtained influence over\r\nM. de Montmorency, and induced him to take with the other Powers the\r\nprecise initiative, and to enter into the very engagements, he had been\r\ninstructed to avoid. M. de Chateaubriand, who filled only a secondary\r\npost in the official negotiation, kept at first a little on the\r\nreserve: \"I do not much like the general position in which he has\r\nplaced himself here,\" wrote M. de Montmorency to Madame Recamier;[17]\r\n\"he is looked upon as singularly sullen; he assumes a stiff and uncouth\r\nmanner, which makes others feel ill at ease in his presence. I shall use\r\nevery effort, before I go, to establish a more congenial intercourse\r\nbetween him and his colleagues.\" M. de Montmorency had no occasion to\r\ntrouble himself much to secure this result. As soon as he had taken his\r\ndeparture, M. de Chateaubriand assumed a courteous and active demeanour\r\nat the Congress. The Emperor Alexander, alive to the reputation of the\r\nauthor of the 'Genius of Christianity,' and to his homage to the founder\r\nof the 'Holy Alliance,' returned him compliment for compliment, flattery\r\nfor flattery, and confirmed him in his desire of war with the Spanish\r\nrevolution, by giving him reason to rely, for that course of policy and\r\nfor himself, upon his unlimited support. Nevertheless, in his\r\ncorrespondence with M. de Villele, M. de Chateaubriand still expressed\r\nhimself very guardedly: \"We left,\" said he, \"our determination in doubt;\r\nwe did not wish to appear impracticable; we were apprehensive that, if\r\nwe discovered ourselves too much, the President of the Council would not\r\nlisten to us.\"\r\n\r\nI presume that M. de Villele fell into no mistake as to the pretended\r\ndoubt in which M. de Chateaubriand endeavoured to envelop himself. I\r\nalso incline to think that he himself, at that epoch, looked upon a war\r\nwith Spain as almost inevitable. But he was still anxious to do all in\r\nhis power to avoid it, if only to preserve with the moderate spirits,\r\nand the interests who dreaded that alternative, the attitude and\r\nreputation of an advocate for peace. Sensible men are unwilling to\r\nanswer for the faults they consent to commit. As soon as he ascertained\r\nthat M. de Montmorency had promised at Verona that his Government would\r\ntake such steps at Madrid, in concert with the three Northern Powers, as\r\nwould infallibly lead to war, M. de Villele submitted to the King in\r\ncouncil these premature engagements, declaring at the same time that,\r\nfor his part, he did not feel that France was bound to adopt the same\r\nline of conduct with Austria, Prussia, and Russia, or to recall at once,\r\nas they wished to do, her Minister at Madrid, and thus to give up all\r\nrenewed attempts at conciliation. It was said that, while using this\r\nlanguage, he had his resignation already prepared and visible in his\r\nportfolio. Powerful supporters were not wanting to this policy. The Duke\r\nof Wellington, recently arrived in Paris, had held a conversation with\r\nM. de Villele, and also with the King, on the dangers of an armed\r\nintervention in Spain, and proposed a plan of mediation, to be concerted\r\nbetween France and England, to induce the Spaniards to introduce into\r\ntheir constitution the modifications which the French Cabinet itself\r\nshould indicate as sufficient to maintain peace. Louis XVIII. placed\r\nconfidence in the judgment and friendly feeling of the Duke of\r\nWellington; he closed the debate in the Council by saying, \"Louis XIV.\r\nlevelled the Pyrenees; I shall not allow them to be raised again. He\r\nplaced my family on the throne of Spain; I cannot let them fall. The\r\nother sovereigns have not the same duties to fulfil. My ambassador\r\nought not to quit Madrid, until the day when a hundred thousand\r\nFrenchmen are in march to replace him.\" The question thus decided\r\nagainst the promises he had made at Verona, M. de Montmorency, on whom a\r\nfew days before, and at the suggestion of M. de Villele, the King had\r\nconferred the title of Duke, suddenly tendered his resignation. The\r\n'Moniteur,' in announcing it, published a despatch which M. de Villele,\r\nwhile holding _ad interim_ the portfolio of foreign affairs, addressed\r\nto Count de Lagarde, the King's minister at Madrid, prescribing to him\r\nan attitude and language which still admitted some chance of\r\nconciliation; and three days later M. de Chateaubriand, after some\r\ndisplay of appropriate hesitation, replaced M. de Montmorency as Foreign\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had scarcely passed over, when the Spanish Government,\r\ncontrolled by a sentiment of national dignity more magnanimous than\r\nenlightened, by popular enthusiasm, and by its own passions, refused all\r\nconstitutional modification whatever. The ambassadors of the three\r\nNorthern Powers had already quitted Madrid. The Count de Lagarde\r\nremained there. On the refusal of the Spaniards, M. de Chateaubriand\r\nrecalled him, on the 18th of January, 1823, instructing him at the same\r\ntime, in a confidential despatch, to suggest the possibility of amicable\r\nmeasures; and of this he also apprised the English Cabinet. These last\r\novertures proved as futile as the preceding ones. At Madrid they had no\r\nconfidence in the French Ministry; and the Government of London placed\r\ntoo little dependence either on the power or discretion of that of\r\nMadrid, to commit itself seriously by engaging the latter, through the\r\nweight of English influence, to submit to the concessions, otherwise\r\nreasonable, which France required. Affairs had reached the point at\r\nwhich the ablest politicians, without faith in the efficacy of their own\r\nviews, were unwilling to adopt decided measures.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1823, M. de Villele determined on war, and the\r\nKing announced this decision in his speech on opening the session of\r\nboth Chambers. Nevertheless eight days later, M. de Chateaubriand\r\ndeclared to Sir Charles Stuart, the English ambassador at Paris, that,\r\nfar from dreaming of establishing absolute power in Spain, France was\r\nstill ready to entertain the constitutional modifications she had\r\nproposed to the Spanish Government, \"as sufficient to induce her to\r\nsuspend hostile preparations, and to renew friendly intercourse between\r\nthe two countries on the old footing.\" At the very moment of engaging in\r\nwar, M. de Chateaubriand, who desired, and M. de Villele, who was averse\r\nto, these extreme measures, equally endeavoured to escape from the\r\nresponsibility attached to them.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to say on the war itself and the course of its incidents.\r\nIn principle it was unjust, for it was unnecessary. The Spanish\r\nrevolution, in spite of its excesses, portended no danger to France or\r\nthe Restoration. The differences to which it gave rise between the two\r\nGovernments might have been easily arranged without violating peace. The\r\nrevolution of Paris, in February, 1848, produced much more serious and\r\nbetter-founded alarms to Europe in general, than the Spanish revolution\r\nin 1823 could have occasioned to France. Nevertheless Europe, with\r\nsound policy, respected towards France the tutelary principle of the\r\ninternal independence of nations, which can never be justly invaded\r\nexcept under an absolute and most urgent necessity. Neither do I think\r\nthat in 1823 the throne and life of Ferdinand VII. were actually in\r\ndanger. All that has since occurred in Spain justifies the conclusion,\r\nthat regicide has no accomplices there, and revolution very few\r\npartisans. The great and legitimate reasons for war were therefore\r\nwanting. In fact, and notwithstanding its success, it led to no\r\nprofitable result either for Spain or France. It surrendered up Spain to\r\nthe incapable and incurable tyranny of Ferdinand VII., without putting\r\nan end to revolutions; and substituted the barbarities of popular\r\nabsolutism for popular anarchy. Instead of securing the influence of\r\nFrance beyond the Pyrenees, it compromised and annulled it to such an\r\nextent that, towards the close of 1823, it was found necessary to have\r\nrecourse to the mediation of Russia, and to send M. Pozzo di Borgo to\r\nMadrid to compel Ferdinand VII. to select more moderate advisers. The\r\nNorthern Powers and England alone retained any credit in Spain,--the\r\nfirst with the King and the Absolutists, the latter with the Liberals;\r\nvictorious France was there politically vanquished. In the eyes of\r\nclear-sighted judges, the advantageous and permanent effects of the war\r\nwere of no more value than the causes.\r\n\r\nAs an expedient of restless policy, as a mere _coup-de-main_ of dynasty\r\nor party, the Spanish war fully succeeded. The sinister predictions of\r\nits opponents were falsified, and the hopes of its advocates surpassed.\r\nBrought under proof together, the fidelity of the army and the impotence\r\nof the conspiring refugees were clearly manifested. The expedition was\r\neasy but not inglorious, and added much to the personal credit of the\r\nDuke d'Angouleme. The prosperity and tranquillity of France received no\r\ncheck. The House of Bourbon exhibited a strength and resolution which\r\nthe Powers who urged it on scarcely expected; and England, who would\r\nhave restrained the effort, submitted to it patiently, although with\r\nsome dissatisfaction. Regarding matters in this light only,\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was correct in writing to M. de Villele from Verona,\r\n\"It is for you, my dear friend, to consider whether you ought not to\r\nseize this opportunity, which may never occur again, of replacing France\r\nin the rank of military powers, and of re-establishing the white\r\ncockade, in a short war almost without danger, and in favour of which\r\nthe opinion of the Royalists and of the army so strongly impels you at\r\nthis moment.\" M. de Villele was mistaken in his answer: \"May God grant,\"\r\nsaid he, \"for my country and for Europe, that we may not persist in an\r\nintervention which I declare beforehand, with the fullest conviction,\r\nwill compromise the safety of France herself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter such an event, in which they had taken such unequal shares, the\r\nrelative positions of these two statesmen became sensibly changed; but\r\nthe alteration did not yet appear for some time. M. de Chateaubriand\r\nendeavoured to triumph with modesty, and M. de Villele, not very\r\nsensitive to the wounds of personal vanity, treated the issue of the war\r\nas a general success of the Cabinet, and prepared to turn it to his own\r\nadvantage, without considering to whom the principal honour might be\r\ndue. Accustomed to power, he exercised it without noise or parade, and\r\nwas careful not to clash with his adversaries or rivals, who thus felt\r\nthemselves led to admit his preponderance as a necessity, rather than\r\nhumiliated to endure it as a defeat. The dissolution of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies became his fixed idea and immediate object. The liberal\r\nOpposition was too strong there to allow him to hope that he could carry\r\nthe great measures necessary to satisfy his party. The Spanish war had\r\nled to debates, continually increasing in animosity, which in time\r\nproduced violence in the stronger, and anger in the weaker party, beyond\r\nall previous example. After the expulsion of M. Manuel on the 3rd of\r\nMarch, 1823, and the conduct of the principal portion of the left-hand\r\nparty, who left the hall with him when he was removed by the gendarmes,\r\nit was almost impossible to expect that the Chamber could resume its\r\nregular place or share in the government. On the 24th of December, 1823,\r\nit was in fact dissolved, and M. de Villele, putting aside the\r\ndifferences of opinion on the Spanish war, applied his whole attention\r\nto ensure the success of the elections and the formation of a new\r\nChamber, from which he could demand with confidence what the right-hand\r\nparty expected from him, and which, according to his expectation, should\r\nsecure a long duration of his influence both with that party and with\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand had no such objects to contemplate or effect.\r\nUnacquainted with the internal government of the country, and the daily\r\nmanagement of the Chambers, he enjoyed the success of _his_ Spanish\r\nwar, as he called it, with tranquil pride,--ready, on provocation, to\r\nbecome active and bitter. He wanted exactly the qualities which\r\ndistinguished M. de Villele, and he possessed those, or rather the\r\ninstinct and inclination of those, in which M. de Villele was deficient.\r\nEntering late on public life, and until then unknown, with a mind but\r\nslightly cultivated, and little distracted from business by the force or\r\nvariety of his imaginative ideas, M. de Villele had ever one leading\r\nobject,--to reach power by faithfully serving his party; and, power once\r\nobtained, to hold it firmly, while exercising it with discretion.\r\n\r\nLaunched on the world almost from infancy, M. de Chateaubriand had\r\ntraversed the whole range of ideas, attempted every career, aspired to\r\nevery renown, exhausted some, and approached others; nothing satisfied\r\nhim. \"My capital defect,\" said he himself, \"has been _ennui_, disgust\r\nwith everything, perpetual doubt.\" A strange temperament in a man\r\ndevoted to the restoration of religion and monarchy! Thus the life of\r\nM. de Chateaubriand had been a constant and a perpetual combat between\r\nhis enterprises and his inclinations, his situation and his nature. He\r\nwas ambitious, as the leader of a party, and independent, as a volunteer\r\nof the forlorn hope; captivated by everything great, and sensitive even\r\nto suffering in the most trifling matters, careless beyond measure of\r\nthe common interests of life, but passionately absorbed, on the stage of\r\nthe world, in his own person and reputation, and more annoyed by the\r\nslightest check than gratified by the most brilliant triumph; in public\r\nlife, more jealous of success than power, capable in a particular\r\nemergency, as he had just proved, of conceiving and carrying out a great\r\ndesign, but unable to pursue in government, with energy and patience, a\r\nwell-cemented and strongly-organized line of policy. He possessed a\r\nsympathetic understanding of the moral impressions of his age and\r\ncountry; more able however, and more inclined, to win their favour by\r\ncompliance than to direct them to important and lasting advantages; a\r\nnoble and expanded mind, which, whether in literature or politics,\r\ntouched all the exalted chords of the human soul, but more calculated to\r\nstrike and charm the imagination than to govern men; greedy, to an\r\nexcess, of praise and fame, to satisfy his pride, and of emotion and\r\nnovelty, as resources from constitutional weariness.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when he was achieving a triumph in Spain for the\r\nHouse of Bourbon, he received disappointments from the latter quarter,\r\nthe remembrance of which he has thought proper to perpetuate\r\nhimself:--\"In our ardour,\" said he, \"after the arrival of the\r\ntelegraphic despatch which announced the deliverance of the King of\r\nSpain, we Ministers hastened to the palace. There I received a warning\r\nof my fall,--a pailful of cold water which recalled me to my usual\r\nhumility. The King and _Monsieur_ took no notice of us. The Duchess\r\nd'Angouleme, bewildered with the glory of her husband, distinguished no\r\none.... On the Sunday following, before the Council met, I returned to\r\npay my duty to the royal family. The august Princess said something\r\ncomplimentary to each of my colleagues; to me she did not deign to\r\naddress a single word: undoubtedly I had no claim to such an honour. The\r\nsilence of the Orphan of the Temple can never be considered\r\nungrateful.\" A more liberal sovereign undertook to console\r\nM. de Chateaubriand for this royal ingratitude; the Emperor Alexander,\r\nwith whom he had continued in intimate correspondence, being anxious to\r\nsignalize his satisfaction, conferred on him and M. de Montmorency, and\r\non them alone, the great riband of the Order of St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nM. de Villele was not insensible to this public token of imperial favour\r\nbestowed on himself and his policy; and the King, Louis XVIII., showed\r\nthat he was even more moved by it. \"Pozzo and La Ferronays,\" said he to\r\nM. de Villele, \"have made me give you, through the Emperor Alexander, a\r\nslap on the cheek; but I shall be even with him, and mean to pay for it\r\nin coin of a better stamp. I name you, my dear Villele, a knight of my\r\nOrders; they are worth more than his.\" And M. de Villele received from\r\nthe King the Order of St. Esprit. It was in vain that a little later,\r\nand on the mutual request of the two rivals, the Emperor Alexander\r\nconferred on M. de Villele the Grand Cross of St. Andrew, and the King,\r\nLouis XVIII., gave the Saint Esprit to M. de Chateaubriand; favours thus\r\nextorted cannot efface the original disappointments.\r\n\r\nTo these courtly slights were soon added causes of rupture more serious.\r\nThe dissolution of the Chamber had succeeded far beyond the expectations\r\nof the Cabinet. The elections had not returned from the left, or the\r\nleft centre, more than seventeen oppositionists. Much more exclusively\r\nthan that of 1815, the new Chamber belonged to the right-hand party; the\r\nday had now arrived to give them the satisfaction they had long looked\r\nfor. The Cabinet immediately brought in two bills, which appeared to be\r\nevident preparatives and effectual pledges for the measures most\r\nardently desired. By one, the integral remodelling of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies every seven years was substituted for the partial and annual\r\nreconstruction as at present in force. This was bestowing on the new\r\nChamber a guarantee of power as of durability. The second bill proposed\r\nthe conversion of the five per cent. annuities into three per cents;\r\nthat is to say, a reimbursement, to the holders of stock, of their\r\ncapital at par, or the reduction of interest. To this great financial\r\nscheme was joined a political measure of equal importance,--indemnity to\r\nthe Emigrants, with preparations for carrying it into effect. The two\r\nbills had been discussed and approved in council. On the question of the\r\nseptennial renewal of the Chamber of Deputies, M. de Chateaubriand\r\nproposed the reduction of age necessary for electors; he failed in this\r\nobject, but still supported the bill. With respect to the conversion\r\nof the funds, the friends of M. de Villele asserted that\r\nM. de Chateaubriand warmly expressed his approbation of the measure, and\r\nwas even anxious that, by a previous arrangement with the bankers,\r\nM. de Villele should secure the means of carrying it, as a preface to\r\nthat which was intended to heal the most festering wound of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nBut the debate in the Chambers soon destroyed the precarious harmony of\r\nthe Cabinet. The conversion of the funds was vigorously opposed, not\r\nonly by the numerous interests thereby injured, but by the unsatisfied\r\nfeeling of the public on a new measure extremely complicated and\r\nill understood. In both Chambers, the greater portion of\r\nM. de Chateaubriand's friends spoke against the bill; it was said that\r\nhe was even hostile to it himself. Some observations were attributed to\r\nhim on the imprudence of a measure which no one desired, no public\r\nnecessity called for, and was merely an invention of the bankers,\r\nadopted by a Minister of Finance, who hoped to extract reputation from\r\nwhat might lead to his ruin. \"I have often seen,\" he was accused of\r\nsaying, \"people break their heads against a wall; but I have never,\r\nuntil now, seen people build a wall for the express purpose of running\r\ntheir heads against it.\" M. de Villele listened to these reports, and\r\nexpressed his surprise at them; his supporters inquired into the cause.\r\nHints were uttered of jealousy, of ambition, of intrigues to depose the\r\nPresident of the Council, and to occupy his place. When the bill had\r\npassed the Chamber of Deputies, the debate in the Chamber of Peers, and\r\nthe part that M. de Chateaubriand would take in it, were looked forward\r\nto with considerable misgivings. He maintained profound silence, not\r\naffording the slightest support; and when the bill was thrown out,\r\napproaching M. de Villele, he said to him, \"If you resign, we are ready\r\nto follow you.\" He adds, while relating this proposal himself,\r\n\"M. de Villele, for sole answer, honoured us with a look which we still\r\nhave before us. This look, however, made no impression.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known how M. de Chateaubriand was dismissed two days after\r\nthe sitting. From whence proceeded the rudeness of this dismissal? It is\r\ndifficult to decide. M. de Chateaubriand attributed it to M. de Villele\r\nalone. \"On Whit Sunday, the 6th of June, 1824,\" says he, \"at half-past\r\nten in the morning I repaired to the palace. My principal object was to\r\npay my respects to _Monsieur_. The first saloon of the Pavillon Marsan\r\nwas nearly empty; a few persons entered in succession, and seemed\r\nembarrassed. An aide-de-camp of _Monsieur_ said to me, 'Viscount, I\r\nscarcely hoped to see you here; have you received no communication?' I\r\nanswered, 'No; what am I likely to receive?' He replied, 'I fear you\r\nwill soon learn.' Upon this, as no one offered to introduce me to\r\n_Monsieur_, I went to hear the music in the chapel. I was quite absorbed\r\nin the beautiful anthems of the service, when an usher told me some one\r\nwished to speak with me. It was Hyacinth Pilorge, my secretary. He\r\nhanded to me a letter and a royal ordinance, saying at the same time,\r\n'Sir, you are no longer a minister.' The Duke de Rauzan, Superintendent\r\nof Political Affairs, had opened the packet in my absence, and had not\r\nventured to bring it to me. I found within, this note from\r\nM. de Villele; 'Monsieur le Vicomte,--I obey the orders of the King, in\r\ntransmitting without delay to your Excellency a decree which his Majesty\r\nhas just placed in my hand:--The Count de Villele, President of our\r\nMinisterial Council, is charged, _ad interim_, with the portfolio of\r\nForeign Affairs, in place of the Viscount de Chateaubriand.'\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of M. de Villele assert that it was the King himself, who in\r\nhis anger dictated the rude form of the communication. \"Two days after\r\nthe vote,\" say they, \"as soon as M. de Villele entered the royal\r\ncabinet, Louis XVIII. said to him: 'Chateaubriand has betrayed us like\r\na----; I do not wish to receive him after Mass; draw up the order for\r\nhis dismissal, and let it be sent to him in time; I will not see him.'\r\nAll remonstrances were useless; the King insisted that the\r\ndecree should be written at his own desk and immediately forwarded.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was not found at home, and his dismissal was only\r\ncommunicated to him at the Tuileries, in the apartments of _Monsieur_.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever may have been the author of the measure, the blame rests with\r\nM. de Villele. If it was contrary to his desire, assuredly he had credit\r\nenough with the King to prevent it. Contrary to his usual habit, he\r\nexhibited more temper on this occasion than coolness or foresight. There\r\nare allies who are necessary, although extremely troublesome; and\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, despite his pretensions and his whims, was less\r\ndangerous as a rival than as an enemy.\r\n\r\nAlthough without connection in the Chambers, and with no control as an\r\norator, he immediately became a brilliant and influential leader of the\r\nOpposition, for opposition was his natural bent as well as the\r\nexcitement of the moment. He excelled in unravelling the instincts of\r\nnational discontent, and of continually exciting them against authority\r\nby supplying them with powerful motives, real or specious, and always\r\nintroduced with effect. He also possessed the art of depreciating and\r\ncasting odium on his adversaries, by keen and polished insults\r\nconstantly repeated, and at the same time of bringing over to his side\r\nold opponents, destined soon to resume their former character, but for\r\nthe moment attracted and overpowered by the pleasure and profit of the\r\nheavy blows he administered to their common enemy. Through the favour\r\nof the MM. Bertin, he found on the instant, in the 'Journal des Debats,'\r\nan important avenue for his daily attacks. As enlightened and\r\ninfluential in politics as in literature, these two brothers possessed\r\nthe rare faculty of collecting round themselves by generous and\r\nsympathetic patronage, a chosen cohort of clever writers, and of\r\nsupporting their opinions and those of their friends with manly\r\nintelligence. M. Bertin de Veaux, the more decided politician of the\r\ntwo, held M. de Villele in high esteem, and lived in familiar intimacy\r\nwith him. \"Villele,\" said he to me one day, \"is really born for public\r\nbusiness; he has all the necessary disinterestedness and capacity; he\r\ncares not to shine, he wishes only to govern; he would be a Minister of\r\nFinance in the cellar of his hotel, as willingly as in the drawing-rooms\r\nof the first story.\" It was no trifling matter which could induce the\r\neminent journalist to break with the able minister. He sought an\r\ninterview with M. de Villele, and requested him, for the preservation of\r\npeace, to bestow on M. de Chateaubriand the embassy to Rome. \"I shall\r\nnot risk such a proposition to the King,\" replied M. de Villele. \"In\r\nthat case,\" retorted M. Bertin, \"you will remember that the 'Debats'\r\noverthrew the ministries of Decazes and Richelieu, and will do the same\r\nby the ministry of Villele.\"--\"You turned out the two first to establish\r\nroyalism,\" said M. de Villele; \"to destroy mine you must have a\r\nrevolution.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in this prospect to inspire M. de Villele with\r\nconfidence, as the event proved; but thirteen years later,\r\nM. Bertin de Veaux remembered the caution. When, in 1837, under\r\ncircumstances of which I shall speak in their proper place, I separated\r\nfrom M. Mole, he said to me with frankness, \"I have certainly quite as\r\nmuch friendship for you as I ever had for M. de Chateaubriand, but I\r\ndecline following you into Opposition. I shall not again try to sap the\r\nGovernment I wish to establish. One experiment of that nature is\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nAt Court, as in the Chamber, M. de Villele was triumphant; he had not\r\nonly conquered, but he had driven away his rivals, M. de Montmorency and\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, as he had got rid of M. de La Fayette and\r\nM. Manuel. Amongst the men whose voices, opinions, or even presence\r\nmight have fettered him, death had already stepped in, and was again\r\ncoming to his aid. M. Camille Jordan, the Duke de Richelieu, and\r\nM. de Serre were dead; General Foy and the Emperor Alexander were not\r\nlong in following them. There are moments when death seems to delight,\r\nlike Tarquin, in cutting down the tallest flowers. M. de Villele\r\nremained sole master. At this precise moment commenced the heavy\r\ndifficulties of his position, the weak points of his conduct, and his\r\nfirst steps towards decline.\r\n\r\nIn place of having to defend himself against a powerful opposition of\r\nthe Left, which was equally to be feared and resisted by the Right and\r\nthe Cabinet, he found himself confronted by an Opposition emanating from\r\nthe right itself, and headed, in the Chamber of Deputies, by\r\nM. de la Bourdonnaye, his companion during the session of 1815; in the\r\nChamber of Peers and without, by M. de Chateaubriand, so recently his\r\ncolleague in the Council. As long as he had M. de Chateaubriand for an\r\nally, M. de Villele had only encountered as adversaries, in the interior\r\nof his party, the ultra-royalists of the extreme right,\r\nM. de la Bourdonnaye, M. Delalot, and a few others, whom the old\r\ncounter-revolutionary spirit, intractable passions, ambitious\r\ndiscontent, or habits of grumbling independence kept in a perpetual\r\nstate of irritation against a power, moderate without ascendency, and\r\nclever without greatness. But when M. de Chateaubriand and the 'Journal\r\ndes Debats' threw themselves into the combat, there was then seen to\r\nmuster round them an army of anti-ministerialists of every origin and\r\ncharacter, composed of royalists and liberals, of old and young France,\r\nof the popular and the aristocratic throng. The weak remains of the\r\nleft-hand party, beaten in the recent elections, the seventeen old\r\nmembers of the Opposition, liberals or doctrinarians, drew breath when\r\nthey looked on such allies; and, without confounding their ranks, while\r\neach party retained its own standard and arms, they combined for mutual\r\nsupport, and united their forces against M. de Villele.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand has gratified himself by inserting in his Memoirs\r\nthe testimonies of admiration and sympathy proffered to him at that time\r\nby M. Benjamin Constant, General Sebastiani, M. Etienne, and other heads\r\nof the liberal section. In the Parliamentary struggle, the left-hand\r\nparty could only add to the opposers of the right a very small number of\r\nvotes; but they brought eminent talents, the support of their journals,\r\ntheir influence throughout the country; and, in a headlong, confused\r\nattack,--some under cover of the mantle of Royalism, others shielded by\r\nthe popularity of their allies,--they waged fierce war against the\r\ncommon enemy.\r\n\r\nIn presence of such an Opposition, M. de Villele fell into a more\r\nformidable danger than that of the sharp contests he had to encounter to\r\nhold ground against it: he was given over without protection or refuge\r\nto the influence and views of his own friends. He could no longer awe\r\nthem by the power of the left-hand party, nor find occasionally in the\r\nunsettled position of the Chamber a bulwark against their demands. There\r\nhad ceased to be a formidable balance of oppositionists or waverers; the\r\nmajority, and a great majority, was ministerial and determined to\r\nsupport the Cabinet; but it had no real apprehension of the\r\nadversaries by whom it was attacked. It preferred M. de Villele to\r\nM. de la Bourdonnaye and M. de Chateaubriand, believing him more capable\r\nof managing with advantage the interests of the party; but if\r\nM. de Villele went counter to the wishes of that majority, if it ceased\r\nto hold a perfect understanding with him, it could then fall back on\r\nMM. de Chateaubriand and de la Bourdonnaye. M. de Villele had no\r\nresource against the majority; he was a minister at the mercy of his\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nAmongst these were some of opposite pretensions, and who lent him their\r\nsupport on very unequal conditions. If he had only had to deal with\r\nthose I shall designate as the politicals and laymen of the party, he\r\nmight have been able to satisfy and govern in concert with them.\r\nNotwithstanding their prejudices, the greater part of the\r\ncountry-gentlemen and royalist citizens were neither over-zealous nor\r\nexacting; they had fallen in with the manners of new France, and had\r\neither found or recovered their natural position in present society,\r\nreconciling themselves to constitutional government, since they were no\r\nlonger considered as the vanquished side. The indemnity to the\r\nemigrants, some pledges of local influence, and the distribution of\r\npublic functions, would have long sufficed to secure their support to\r\nM. de Villele; but another portion of his army, numerous, important, and\r\nnecessary, the religious department, was much more difficult to satisfy\r\nand control.\r\n\r\nI am not disposed to revive any of the particular expressions which were\r\nthen used as weapons of war, and have now become almost insulting. I\r\nshall neither speak of the _priestly_, nor of the _congregational\r\nparty_, nor even of the _Jesuits_. I should reproach myself for reviving\r\nby such language and reminiscences the evil, heavy in itself, which\r\nFrance and the Restoration were condemned at that time, the one to fear,\r\nand the other to endure.\r\n\r\nThis evil, which glimmered through the first Restoration, through the\r\nsession of 1815, and still exists, in spite of so many storms and such\r\nincreasing intelligence, is, in fact a war declared by a considerable\r\nportion of the Catholic Church of France, against existing French\r\nsociety, its principles, its organization, political and civil, its\r\norigin and its tendencies. It was during the ministry of M. de Villele,\r\nand above all when he found himself alone and confronted with his party,\r\nthat the mischief displayed its full force.\r\n\r\nNever was a similar war more irrational or inopportune. It checked the\r\nreaction, which had commenced under the Consulate, in favour of creeds\r\nand the sentiment of religion. I have no desire to exaggerate the value\r\nof that reaction; I hold faith and true piety in too much respect to\r\nconfound them with the superficial vicissitudes of human thought and\r\nopinion. Nevertheless the movement which led France back towards\r\nChristianity was more sincere and serious than it actually appeared to\r\nbe. It was at once a public necessity and an intellectual taste.\r\nSociety, worn out with commotion and change, sought for fixed points on\r\nwhich it could rely and repose; men, disgusted with a terrestrial and\r\nmaterial atmosphere, aspired to ascend once more towards higher and\r\npurer horizons; the inclinations of morality concurred with the\r\ninstincts of social interest. Left to its natural course, and supported\r\nby the purely religious influence of a clergy entirely devoted to the\r\nre-establishment of faith and Christian life, this movement was likely\r\nto extend and to restore to religion its legitimate empire.\r\n\r\nBut instead of confining itself to this sphere of action, many members\r\nand blind partisans of the Catholic clergy descended to worldly\r\nquestions, and showed themselves more zealous to recast French society\r\nin its old mould, and so to restore their church to its former place\r\nthere, than to reform and purify the moral condition of souls. Here was\r\na profound mistake. The Christian Church is not like the pagan Antaeus,\r\nwho renews his strength by touching the earth; it is on the contrary, by\r\ndetaching itself from the world, and re-ascending towards heaven, that\r\nthe Church in its hours of peril regains its vigour. When we saw it\r\ndepart from its appropriate and sublime mission, to demand penal laws\r\nand to preside over the distribution of offices; when we beheld its\r\ndesires and efforts prominently directed against the principles and\r\ninstitutions which constitute today the essence of French society; when\r\nliberty of conscience, publicity, the legal separation of civil and\r\nreligious life, the laical character of the State, appeared to be\r\nattacked and compromised,--on that instant the rising tide of religious\r\nreaction stopped, and yielded way to a contrary current. In place of the\r\nmovement which thinned the ranks of the unbelievers to the advantage of\r\nthe faithful, we saw the two parties unite together; the eighteenth\r\ncentury appeared once more in arms; Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, and\r\ntheir worst disciples once more spread themselves abroad and recruited\r\ninnumerable battalions. War was declared against society in the name of\r\nthe Church, and society returned war for war:--a deplorable chaos, in\r\nwhich good and evil, truth and falsehood, justice and injustice, were\r\nconfounded together, and blows hurled at random on every side.\r\n\r\nI know not whether M. de Villele thoroughly estimated, in his own\r\nthoughts, the full importance of this situation of affairs, and the\r\ndangers to which he exposed religion and the Restoration. His was not a\r\nmind either accustomed or disposed to ponder long over general facts and\r\nmoral questions, or to sound them deeply. But he thoroughly\r\ncomprehended, and felt acutely, the embarrassment which might accrue\r\nfrom these causes to his own power; and he tried to diminish them by\r\nyielding to clerical influence in the government, imposing though\r\nlimited sacrifices, flattering himself that by these means he should\r\nacquire allies in the Church itself, who would aid him to restrain the\r\noverweening and imprudent pretensions of their own friends. Already, and\r\nshortly after his accession to the ministry, he had appointed an\r\necclesiastic in good estimation, and whom the Pope had named Bishop of\r\nHermopolis, the Abbe Frayssinous, to the head-mastership of the\r\nUniversity. Two months after the fall of M. de Chateaubriand, the Abbe\r\nFrayssinous entered the Cabinet as Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs\r\nand Public Instruction--a new department created expressly for him. He\r\nwas a man of sense and moderation, who had acquired, by Christian\r\npreaching without violence, and conduct in which prudence was blended\r\nwith dignity, a reputation and importance somewhat superior to his\r\nactual merits, and which he had no desire to compromise. In 1816 he had\r\nbeen a member of the Royal Commission of Public Education, over which\r\nM. Royer-Collard at that time presided; but soon retired from it, not\r\nwishing either to share the responsibility of his superior or to act in\r\nopposition to him. He generally approved of the policy of M. de Villele;\r\nbut although binding himself to support it, and while lamenting the\r\nblind demands of a portion of the clergy, he endeavoured, when\r\nopportunity offered, to excuse and conceal rather than reject them\r\naltogether. Without betraying M. de Villele, he afforded him little aid,\r\nand committed him repeatedly by his language in public, which invariably\r\ntended more to maintain his own position in the Church than to serve the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThree months only had elapsed since M. de Villele, separated from his\r\nmost brilliant colleagues and an important portion of his old friends,\r\nhad sustained the entire weight of government, when the King Louis\r\nXVIII. died. The event had long been foreseen, and M. de Villele had\r\nskilfully prepared for it: he was as well established in the esteem and\r\nconfidence of the new monarch as of the sovereign who had just passed\r\nfrom the Tuileries to St. Denis; Charles X., the Dauphin, and the\r\nDauphiness, all three looked upon him as the ablest and most valuable of\r\ntheir devoted adherents. But M. de Villele soon discovered that he had\r\nchanged masters, and that little dependence could be placed on the mind\r\nor heart of a king, even though sincere, when the surface and the\r\ninterior were not in unison. Men belong, much more than is generally\r\nsupposed, or than they believe themselves, to their real convictions.\r\nMany comparisons, for the sake of contrast, have been drawn between\r\nLouis XVIII. and Charles X.; the distinction between them was even\r\ngreater than has been stated. Louis XVIII. was a moderate of the old\r\nsystem, and a liberal-minded inheritor of the eighteenth century;\r\nCharles X. was a true emigrant and a submissive bigot. The wisdom of\r\nLouis XVIII. was egotistic and sceptical, but serious and sincere; when\r\nCharles X. acted like a sensible king, it was through propriety, from\r\ntimid and short-sighted complaisance, from being carried away, or from\r\nthe desire of pleasing,--not from conviction or natural choice. Through\r\nall the different Cabinets of his reign, whether under the\r\nAbbe de Montesquiou, M. de Talleyrand, the Duke de Richelieu,\r\nM. Decazes, and M. de Villele, the government of Louis XVIII. was ever\r\nconsistent with itself; without false calculation or premeditated\r\ndeceit, Charles X. wavered from contradiction to contradiction, from\r\ninconsistency to inconsistency, until the day when, given up to his own\r\nwill and belief, he committed the error which cost him his throne.\r\n\r\nDuring three years, from the accession of Charles X. to his own fall,\r\nM. de Villele not only made no stand against the inconsiderate\r\nfickleness of the King, but even profited by it to strengthen himself\r\nagainst his various enemies. Too clear-sighted to hope that Charles X.\r\nwould persevere in the voluntary course of premeditated and steady\r\nmoderation which Louis XVIII. had followed, he undertook to make him at\r\nleast pursue, when circumstances allowed, a line of policy sufficiently\r\ntemperate and popular to save him from the appearance of being\r\nexclusively in the hands of the party to whom in fact his heart and\r\nfaith were devoted. Skilful in varying his advice according to the\r\nnecessities and chances of the moment, and aptly availing himself of the\r\ninclination of Charles X. for sudden measures, whether lenient or\r\nsevere, M. de Villele at one time abolished, and at another revived, the\r\ncensorship of the journals, occasionally softened or aggravated the\r\nexecution of the laws, always endeavouring, and frequently with success,\r\nto place in the mouth or in the name of the King, liberal demonstrations\r\nand effusions, by the side of words and tendencies which recalled the\r\nold system and the pretensions of absolute power. The same spirit\r\ngoverned him in the Chambers. His bills were so conceived and presented,\r\nas we may say, to the address of the different parties, that all\r\ninfluential opinions were conciliated to a certain extent. The\r\nindemnity to the emigrants satisfied the wishes and restored the\r\nposition of the entire lay party of the right. The recognition of the\r\nRepublic of Hayti pleased the Liberals. Judicious reforms in the\r\nnational budget and an administration friendly to sound regulations and\r\nactual services, obtained for M. de Villele the esteem of enlightened\r\nmen and the general approbation of all public functionaries. The bill on\r\nthe system of inheritance and the right of primogeniture afforded hope\r\nto those who were prepossessed with aristocratic regrets. The bill on\r\nsacrilege fostered the passions of the fanatics, and the views of their\r\ntheorists. Parallel with the spirit of reaction which predominated in\r\nthese legislative deliberations, as in the enactments of power, an\r\nintelligent effort was ever visible to contrive something to the\r\nadvantage of the spirit of progress. While faithfully serving his\r\nfriends, M. de Villele sought for and availed himself of every\r\nopportunity that offered of making some compensation to his adversaries.\r\n\r\nIt was not that the state of his mind was changed in principle, or that\r\nhe had identified himself with the new and liberally-disposed society\r\nwhich he courted with so much solicitude. After all, M. de Villele\r\ncontinued ever to be a follower of the old system, true to his party\r\nfrom feeling as well as on calculation. But his ideas on the subject of\r\nsocial and political organization were derived from tradition and habit,\r\nrather than from personal and well-meditated conviction. He preserved,\r\nwithout making them his sole rule of conduct, and laid them aside\r\noccasionally, without renunciation. A strong practical instinct, and\r\nthe necessity of success, were his leading characteristics; he had the\r\npeculiar tact of knowing what would succeed and what would not, and\r\npaused in face of obstacles, either judging them to be insurmountable,\r\nor to demand too much time for removal. I find, in a letter which he\r\nwrote on the 31st of October, 1824, to Prince Julius de Polignac, at\r\nthat time ambassador in London, on the projected re-establishment of the\r\nlaw of primogeniture, the strong expression of his inward thought, and\r\nof his clear-sighted prudence in an important act. \"You would be wrong\r\nto suppose,\" said he, \"that it is because entailed titles and estates\r\nare perpetual, we do not create any. You give us too much credit; the\r\npresent generation sets no value on considerations so far removed from\r\ntheir own time. The late King named Count K---- a peer, on the proviso\r\nof his investing an estate with the title; he gave up the peerage,\r\nrather than injure his daughter to the advantage of his son. Out of\r\ntwenty affluent families, there is scarcely one inclined to place the\r\neldest son so much above the rest. Egotism prevails everywhere. People\r\nprefer to live on good terms with all their children, and, when\r\nestablishing them in the world, to show no preference. The bonds of\r\nsubordination are so universally relaxed, that parents, I believe, are\r\nobliged to humour their own offspring. If the Government were to propose\r\nthe re-establishment of the law of primogeniture, it would not have a\r\nmajority on that question; the difficulty is more deeply seated; it lies\r\nin our habits, still entirely impressed with the consequences of the\r\nRevolution. I do not wish to say that nothing can be done to ameliorate\r\nthis lamentable position; but I feel that, in a state of society so\r\ndiseased, we require time and management, not to lose in a day the\r\nlabour and fruit of many years. To know how to proceed, and never to\r\nswerve from that path, to make a step towards the desired end whenever\r\nit can be made, and never to incur the necessity of retreat,--this\r\ncourse appears to me to be one of the necessities of the time in which I\r\nhave arrived at power, and one of the causes which have led me to the\r\npost I occupy.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Villele spoke truly; it was his rational loyalty to the interests\r\nof his party, his patient perseverance in marching step by step to his\r\nobject, his calm and correct distinction between the possible and\r\nimpossible, which had made and kept him minister. But in the great\r\ntransformations of human society, when the ideas and passions of nations\r\nhave been powerfully stirred up, good sense, moderation, and cleverness\r\nwill not long suffice to control them; and the day will soon return\r\nwhen, either to promote good or restrain evil, defined convictions and\r\nintentions, strongly and openly expressed, are indispensable to the\r\nheads of government. M. de Villele was not endowed with these qualities.\r\nHis mind was accurate, rather than expanded; he had more ingenuity than\r\nvigour, and he yielded to his party when he could no longer direct it.\r\n\"I am born for the end of revolutions,\" he exclaimed when arriving at\r\npower, and he judged himself well; but he estimated less correctly the\r\ngeneral state of society: the Revolution was much further from its end\r\nthan he believed; it was continually reviving round him, excited and\r\nstrengthened by the alternately proclaimed and concealed attempts of\r\nthe counter-principle. People had ceased to conspire; but they\r\ndiscussed, criticized, and contended with undiminished ardour in the\r\nlegitimate field. There were no longer secret associations, but opinions\r\nwhich fermented and exploded on every side. And, in this public\r\nmovement, impassioned resistance was chiefly directed against the\r\npreponderance and pretensions of the fanatically religious party. One of\r\nthe most extraordinary infatuations of our days has been the blindness\r\nof this party to the fact that the conditions under which they acted,\r\nand the means they employed, were directly opposed to the end in view,\r\nand leading from rather than conducting to it. They desired to restrain\r\nliberty, to control reason, to impose faith; they talked, wrote, and\r\nargued; they sought and found arms in the system of inquiry and\r\npublicity which they denounced. Nothing could be more natural or\r\nlegitimate on the part of believers who have full confidence in their\r\ncreed, and consider it equal to the conversion of its adversaries. The\r\nlatter are justified in recurring to the discussion and publicity which\r\nthey expect to serve their cause. But those who consider publicity and\r\nfree discussion as essentially mischievous, by appealing to these\r\nresources, foment themselves the movement they dread, and feed the fire\r\nthey wish to extinguish. To prove themselves not only consistent, but\r\nwise and effective, they should obtain by other means the strength on\r\nwhich they rely: they should gain the mastery; and then, when they have\r\nsilenced all opposition, let them speak alone, if they still feel the\r\nnecessity of speaking. But until they have arrived at this point, let\r\nthem not deceive themselves; by adopting the weapons of liberty, they\r\nserve liberty much more than they injure it, for they warn and place it\r\non its guard. To secure victory to the system of order and government to\r\nwhich they aspire, there is but one road;--the Inquisition and Philip\r\nII. were alone acquainted with their trade.\r\n\r\nAs might naturally be expected, the resistance provoked by the attempts\r\nof the fanatical party soon transformed itself into an attack. One\r\nroyalist gentleman raised the flag of opposition against the policy of\r\nM. de Villele; another assailed the religious controllers of his\r\nCabinet, and not only dragged them before public opinion, but before the\r\njustice of the country, which disarmed and condemned them, without\r\ninflicting any other sentence than that of its disapprobation in the\r\nname of the law.\r\n\r\nNo one was less a philosopher of the eighteenth century, or a liberal of\r\nthe nineteenth, than the Count de Montlosier. In the Constituent\r\nAssembly he had vehemently defended the Church and resisted the\r\nRevolution; he was sincerely a royalist, an aristocrat, and a Catholic.\r\nPeople called him, not without reason, the feudal publicist. But,\r\nneither the ancient nobility nor the modern citizens were disposed to\r\nsubmit to ecclesiastical dominion. M. de Montlosier repulsed it, equally\r\nin the name of old and new France, as he would formerly have denied its\r\nsupremacy from the battlements of his castle, or in the court of Philip\r\nthe Handsome. The early French spirit re-appeared in him, free, while\r\nrespectful towards the Church, and as jealous of the laical independence\r\nof the State and crown, as it was possible for a member of the Imperial\r\nState Council to show himself.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, a man of the people, born a poet and rendered still\r\nmore poetical by art, celebrated, excited, and expanded, through his\r\nsongs, popular instincts and passions in opposition to everything that\r\nrecalled the old system, and above all against the pretensions and\r\nsupremacy of the Church. M. Beranger, in his heart, was neither a\r\nrevolutionist nor an unbeliever; he was morally more honest, and\r\npolitically more rational, than his songs; but, a democrat by conviction\r\nas well as inclination, and carried away into license and want of\r\nforethought by the spirit of democracy, he attacked indiscriminately\r\neverything that was ungracious to the people, troubling himself little\r\nas to the range of his blows, looking upon the success of his songs as a\r\nvictory achieved by liberty, and forgetting that religious faith and\r\nrespect for things holy are nowhere more necessary than in the bosom of\r\ndemocratic and liberal associations. I believe he discovered this a\r\nlittle too late, when he found himself individually confronted by the\r\npassions which his ballads had fomented, and the dreams he had\r\ntransformed to realities. He then hastened, with sound sense and\r\ndignity, to escape from the political arena, and almost from the world,\r\nunchanged in his sentiments, but somewhat regretful and uneasy for the\r\nconsequences of the war in which he had taken such a prominent part.\r\nUnder the Restoration, he was full of confidence and zeal, enjoying his\r\npopularity with modesty, and more seriously hostile and influential than\r\nany sonneteer had ever been before him.\r\n\r\nThus, after six years of government by the right-hand party, and three\r\nof the reign of Charles X., matters had arrived at this point--that two\r\nof the chief royalist leaders marched at the head of an opposition, one\r\nagainst the Cabinet, and the other against the Clergy, both becoming\r\nfrom day to day more vigorous and extended, and that the Restoration\r\nenumerated a ballad-maker in the first rank of its most dangerous\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThis entire mischief and danger was universally attributed to\r\nM. de Villele; on the right or on the left, in the saloons and the\r\njournals, amongst the Moderates and the extreme Radicals, he became more\r\nand more an object of attack and reproach. As the judicial bodies had\r\nacted in affairs which regarded religion, so the literary institutions,\r\non questions which concerned their competence, eagerly seized the\r\nopportunity of manifesting their opposition. The University, compressed\r\nand mutilated, was in a state of utter discontent. The French Academy\r\nmade it a duty of honour to protest, in an address which the King\r\nrefused to receive, but which was nevertheless voted, against the new\r\nbill on the subject of the press, introduced to the Chamber in 1826, and\r\nwithdrawn by the Cabinet three months afterwards. In his own Chamber of\r\nPeers, M. de Villele found neither general goodwill nor a certain\r\nmajority. Even at the Palais Bourbon and the Tuileries, his two\r\nstrongholds, he visibly lost ground; in the Chamber of Deputies, the\r\nministerial majority declined, and became sad even in triumph; at the\r\ncourt, several of the King's most trusty adherents, the\r\nDukes de Riviere, de Fitz-James, and de Maille, the Count de Glanderes,\r\nand many others,--some through party spirit, and some from monarchical\r\nuneasiness,--desired the fall of M. de Villele, and were already\r\npreparing his successors. Even the King himself, when any fresh\r\nmanifestation of public feeling reached him, exclaimed pettishly, on\r\nentering his closet, \"Always Villele! always against Villele!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, the injustice was shameful. If the right-hand party had held\r\noffice for six years, and had used power so as to maintain it, if\r\nCharles X. had not only peaceably succeeded Louis XVIII., but had ruled\r\nwithout trouble, and even with some increase of popularity, it was to\r\nM. de Villele, above all others, that they were indebted for these\r\nadvantages. He had accomplished two difficult achievements, which might\r\nhave been called great had they been more durable: he had disciplined\r\nthe old royalist party, and from a section of the court, and a class\r\nwhich had never been really active except in revolutionary contests, he\r\nhad established during six years a steady ministerial support; he had\r\nrestrained his party and his power within the general limits of the\r\nCharter, and had exercised constitutional government for six years under\r\na prince and with friends who were generally considered to understand it\r\nlittle, and to adopt it with reluctance. If the King and the right-hand\r\nparty felt themselves in danger, it was themselves, and not\r\nM. de Villele, whom they ought to have accused.\r\n\r\nNevertheless M. de Villele, on his part, had no right to complain of the\r\ninjustice to which he was exposed. For six years he had been the head of\r\nthe Government; by yielding to the King and his partisans when he\r\ndisapproved their intentions, and by continuing their minister when he\r\ncould no longer prevent what he condemned, he had admitted the\r\nresponsibility of the faults committed under his name and with his\r\nsanction, although in spite of himself. He endured the penalty of his\r\nweakness in the exercise of power, and of his obstinacy in retaining it\r\nunder whatever sacrifices it might cost him. We cannot govern under a\r\nfree system, to enjoy the merit and reap the fruit of success, while we\r\nrepudiate the errors which lead to reverse.\r\n\r\nJustice to M. de Villele requires the acknowledgment that he never\r\nattempted to withdraw himself from the responsibility of his government,\r\nwhether as regarded his own acts or his concessions to his friends. He\r\nwas never seen to reproach the King or his party with the errors to\r\nwhich he became accessory. He knew how to preserve silence and endure\r\nthe blame, even while he had the power of justification. In 1825, after\r\nthe Spanish war, and during the financial debates to which it had given\r\nrise, M. de la Bourdonnaye accused him of having been the author of the\r\ncontracts entered into in 1823, with M. Ouvrard, at Bayonne, for\r\nsupplying the army, and which had been made the subject of violent\r\nattacks. M. de Villele might have closed his adversary's mouth; for on\r\nthe 7th of April, 1823, he had written to the Duke d'Angouleme expressly\r\nto caution him against M. Ouvrard and his propositions. He took no\r\nadvantage of this, but contented himself with explaining to the King in\r\na Council, when the Dauphin was present, the situation in which he was\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin at once authorized him to make use of his letter. \"No,\r\nMonseigneur,\" replied M. de Villele; \"let anything happen to me that\r\nHeaven pleases, it will be of little consequence to the country; but I\r\nshould be guilty towards the King and to France, if, to exculpate myself\r\nfrom an accusation, however serious it may be, I should give utterance,\r\nbeyond the walls of this cabinet, to a single word which could\r\ncompromise the name of your Royal Highness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, notwithstanding his obstinate and confiding disposition, he saw\r\nhimself seriously menaced, when the cries of \"Down with the Ministers!\r\nDown with Villele!\" uttered by several battalions of the National Guard,\r\nboth before and after the review by the King in the Champ-de-Mars on the\r\n29th of April, 1827, had led to their disbanding, and had equally\r\nexcited the public and disturbed the King himself,--when M. de Villele\r\nfelt distinctly that, both in the Chambers and at the Court, he was too\r\nmuch attacked and shaken to govern with efficiency, he resolutely\r\nadopted the course prescribed by the Charter and called for by his\r\nposition; he demanded of the King the dissolution of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and a new general election, which should either re-establish\r\nor finally overthrow the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nCharles X. hesitated; he dreaded the elections, and, although not\r\ndisposed to support his Minister with more firmness, the chance of his\r\nfall, and doubt in the selection of his successors, disturbed him, as\r\nmuch as it was possible for his unreflecting nature to be disturbed.\r\nM. de Villele persisted, the King yielded, and, in defiance of the\r\nelectoral law which, in 1820, M. de Villele and the right-hand party had\r\nenacted, in spite of their six years of power, in spite of all the\r\nefforts of Government to influence the elections, they produced a result\r\nin conformity with the state of general feeling,--a majority composed of\r\ndifferent elements, but decidedly hostile to the Cabinet. After having\r\ncarefully examined this new ground, and after having received from\r\nvarious quarters propositions of accommodation and alliance,\r\nM. de Villele, having clearly estimated his chances of strength and\r\ndurability, retired from office, and recommended the King to return\r\ntowards the centre, and to call together a moderate Ministry, which he\r\nassisted him to construct. Charles X. received his new councillors as he\r\nquitted his old ones, with sadness and apprehension, not acting as he\r\nwished, and scarcely knowing whether what he did would tend to his\r\nadvantage. More decided, not through superiority of mind, but by natural\r\ncourage, the Dauphiness said to him, when she ascertained his\r\nresolution, \"In abandoning M. de Villele, you have descended the first\r\nstep of your throne.\"\r\n\r\nThe political party of which M. de Villele was the head, and which had\r\nits own peculiar destinies, with which those of royalty had never been\r\nclosely allied, might indulge in more gloomy anticipations on their own\r\naccount; they had employed and lost the only man, belonging to their own\r\nranks, who was capable of showing them legitimately how to acquire and\r\nhow to exercise power.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: On the 17th October, and the 22nd of November, 1822.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMY OPPOSITION.\r\n\r\n1820-1829.\r\n\r\n     MY RETIREMENT AT THE MAISONNETTE.--I PUBLISH FOUR INCIDENTAL ESSAYS\r\n     ON POLITICAL AFFAIRS: 1.

Royer-Collard, Camille Jordan, and Barante, I received from all\r\nquarters testimonies of ardent sympathy. Disgrace voluntarily\r\nencountered, and which imposes some sacrifices, flatters political\r\nfriends and interests indifferent spectators. I determined to resume, in\r\nthe Faculty of Letters, my course of modern history. We were then at the\r\nend of July. Madame de Condorcet offered to lend me for several months a\r\ncountry-house, ten leagues from Paris, near Meulan. My acquaintance with\r\nher had never been intimate; her political sentiments differed\r\nmaterially from mine; she belonged thoroughly and enthusiastically to\r\nthe eighteenth century and the Revolution: but she possessed an elevated\r\ncharacter, a strong mind, and a generous heart, capable of warm\r\naffection; a favour offered by her sincerely, and for the sole pleasure\r\nof conferring it, might be received without embarrassment. I accepted\r\nthat which she tendered me, and with the beginning of August I\r\nestablished myself at the Maisonnette, and there recommenced my literary\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nAt that time I was strongly attached, and have ever since remained so,\r\nto public life. Nevertheless I have never quitted it without\r\nexperiencing a feeling of satisfaction mixed with my regret, as that of\r\na man who throws off a burden which he willingly sustained, or who\r\npasses from a warm and exciting atmosphere into a light and refreshing\r\ntemperature. From the first moment, my residence at the Maisonnette\r\npleased me. Situated halfway up a hill, immediately before it was the\r\nlittle town of Meulan, with its two churches, one lately restored for\r\nworship, the other partly in ruins and converted into a magazine; on the\r\nright of the town the eye fell upon L'Ile Belle, entirely parcelled out\r\ninto green meadows and surrounded by tall poplar-trees; in front was\r\nthe old bridge of Meulan, and beyond it the extensive and fertile\r\nvalley of the Seine. The house, not too small, was commodious and neatly\r\narranged; on either side, as you left the dining-hall, were large trees\r\nand groves of shrubs; behind and above the mansion was a garden of\r\nmoderate extent, but intersected by walks winding up the side of the\r\nhill and bordered by flowers. At the top of the garden was a small\r\npavilion well suited for reading alone, or for conversation with a\r\nsingle companion. Beyond the enclosure, and still ascending, were woods,\r\nfields, other country-houses and gardens scattered on different\r\nelevations. I lived there with my wife and my son Francis, who had just\r\nreached his fifth year. My friends often came to visit me. In all that\r\nsurrounded me, there was nothing either rare or beautiful. It was nature\r\nwith her simplest ornaments, and family life in the most unpretending\r\ntranquillity. But nothing was wanting. I had space, verdure, affection,\r\nconversation, liberty, and employment,--the necessity of occupation,\r\nthat spur and bridle which human indolence and mutability so often\r\nrequire. I was perfectly content. When the soul is calm, the heart full,\r\nand the mind active, situations the most opposite to those we have been\r\naccustomed to possess their charms, which speedily become happiness.\r\n\r\nI sometimes went to Paris on affairs of business. I find, in a letter\r\nwhich I wrote to Madame Guizot during one of these journeys, the\r\nimpressions I experienced. \"At the first moment I feel pleasure at\r\nmixing again and conversing with the world, but soon grow weary of\r\nunprofitable words. There is no repetition more tiresome than that\r\nwhich bears upon popular matters. We are eternally listening to what we\r\nknow already; we are perpetually telling others what they are as well\r\nacquainted with as we are: this is, at the same time, insipid and\r\nagitating. In my inaction, I prefer talking to the trees, the flowers,\r\nthe sun, and the wind. Man is infinitely superior to nature; but nature\r\nis always equal, and inexhaustible in her monotony; we know that she\r\nremains and must remain what she is; we never feel in her presence that\r\nnecessity of moving in advance, which makes us impatient or weary of the\r\nsociety of men when they fail to satisfy this imperative demand. Who has\r\never fancied that the trees ought to be red instead of green, or found\r\nfault with the sun of today for resembling the sun of yesterday? We\r\ndemand of nature neither progress nor novelty; and this is why nature\r\ndraws us from the weariness of the world, while she brings repose from\r\nits excitement. It is her attribute to please for ever without changing;\r\nbut immovable man becomes tiresome, and he is not strong enough to be\r\nperpetually in motion.\"\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of this calm and satisfying life, public affairs, the part\r\nI had begun to take in them, the ties of mutual opinion and friendship I\r\nhad formed, the hopes I had entertained for my country and myself,\r\ncontinued nevertheless to occupy much of my attention. I became anxious\r\nto declare aloud my thoughts on the new system under which France was\r\ngoverned; on what that system had become since 1814, and what it ought\r\nto be to keep its word and accomplish its object. Still a stranger to\r\nthe Chambers, it was there alone that I could enter personally into the\r\nfield of politics, and assume my fitting place. I was perfectly\r\nunfettered, and at an age when disinterested confidence in the empire of\r\ntruth blends with the honest aspirations of ambition; I pursued the\r\nsuccess of my cause, while I hoped for personal distinction. After\r\nresiding for two months at the Maisonnette, I published, under this\r\ntitle, 'On the Government of France since the Restoration, and the\r\nMinistry now in Office,' my first oppositional treatise against the\r\npolicy which had been followed since the Duke de Richelieu, by allying\r\nhimself with the right-hand party to change the electoral law, had also\r\nchanged the seat and tendency of power.\r\n\r\nI took up the question, or, to speak more truly, I entered into the\r\ncontest, on the ground on which the Hundred Days and the Chamber of 1815\r\nhad unfortunately placed it:--Who are to exercise, in the government of\r\nFrance, the preponderating influence? the victors or the vanquished of\r\n1789? the middle classes, elevated to their rights, or the privileged\r\norders of earlier times? Is the Charter the conquest of the newly\r\nconstituted society, or the triumph of the old system, the legitimate\r\nand rational accomplishment, or the merited penalty of the revolution?\r\n\r\nI borrow from a preface which I added last year to a new edition of my\r\n'Course of Lectures on the History of Civilization in France,' some\r\nlines which today, after more than forty years of experience and\r\nreflection, convey the faithful impress of my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"It is the blind rivalry of the high social classes, which has\r\noccasioned the miscarriage of our efforts to establish a free\r\ngovernment. Instead of uniting either in defence against despotism, or\r\nto establish practical liberty, the nobility and the citizens have\r\nremained separate, intent on mutually excluding or supplanting each\r\nother, and both refusing to admit equality or superiority. Pretensions\r\nunjust in principal, and vain in fact! The somewhat frivolous pride of\r\nthe nobility has not prevented the citizens of France from rising, and\r\ntaking their place on a level with the highest in the State. Neither\r\nhave the rather puerile jealousies of the citizens hindered the nobility\r\nfrom preserving the advantages of family celebrity and the long tenure\r\nof situation. In every arranged society which lives and increases there\r\nis an internal movement of ascent and acquisition. In all systems that\r\nare destined to endure, a certain hierarchy of conditions and ranks\r\nestablishes and perpetuates itself. Justice, common sense, public\r\nadvantage, and private interest, when properly understood, all require a\r\nreciprocal acknowledgment of these natural facts of social order. The\r\ndifferent classes in France have not known how to adopt this skilful\r\nequity. Thus they have endured, and have also inflicted on their\r\ncountry, the penalty of their irrational egotism. For the vulgar\r\ngratification of remaining, on the one side insolent, on the other\r\nenvious, nobles and citizens have continued much less free, less\r\nimportant, less secure in their social privileges, than they might have\r\nbeen with a little more justice, foresight, and submission to the divine\r\nlaws of human associations. They have been unable to act in concert, so\r\nas to become free and powerful together; and consequently they have\r\ngiven up France and themselves to successive revolutions.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1820, we were far from this free and impartial appreciation of our\r\npolitical history and the causes of our disasters. Re-engaged for five\r\nyears in the track of the old rivalries of classes and the recent\r\nstruggles of revolution, we were entirely occupied with the troubles and\r\ndangers of the moment, and anxious to conquer, without bestowing much\r\nthought on the price or future embarrassments of victory. I upheld with\r\nenthusiasm the cause of the new society, such as the Revolution had made\r\nit, holding equality in the eye of the law as the first principle, and\r\nthe middle classes as the fundamental element. I elevated this cause,\r\nalready so great, by carrying it back to the past, and by discovering\r\nits interests and vicissitudes in the entire series of our history. I\r\nhave no desire to palliate my thoughts or words. \"For more than thirteen\r\ncenturies,\" I said, \"France has comprised two races, the victors and the\r\nvanquished. For more than thirteen centuries, the beaten race has\r\nstruggled to throw off the yoke of its conquerors. Our history is the\r\nhistory of this contest. In our own days, a decisive battle has been\r\nfought. That battle is called the Revolution.... The result was not\r\ndoubtful. Victory declared for those who had been so long subdued. In\r\nturn they conquered France, and in 1814 were in possession beyond\r\ndispute. The Charter acknowledged this fact, proclaimed that it was\r\nfounded on right, and guaranteed that right by the pledge of\r\nrepresentative government. The King, by this single act, established\r\nhimself as the chief of the new conquerors. He placed himself in their\r\nranks and at their head, engaging himself to defend with them, and for\r\nthem, the conquests of the Revolution, which were theirs. The Charter\r\nimplied such an engagement, beyond all question; for war was on the\r\npoint of recommencing. It was easy to foresee that the vanquished party\r\nwould not tamely submit to their defeat. Not that it reduced them to the\r\ncondition to which they had formerly humiliated their adversaries; they\r\nfound rights, if they lost privileges, and, while falling from high\r\nsupremacy, might repose on equality; but great masses of men will not\r\nthus abdicate human weakness, and their reason ever remains far in the\r\nrear of their necessity. All that preserved or restored to the ancient\r\npossessors of privilege a gleam of hope, urged and tempted them to grasp\r\nit. The Restoration could not fail to produce this effect. The fall of\r\nprivilege had entrained the subversion of the throne; it might be hoped\r\nthat the throne would restore privilege with its own re-establishment.\r\nHow was it possible not to cherish this hope? Revolutionary France held\r\nit in dread. But even if the events of 1814 had not effected the\r\nRestoration, if the Charter had been given to us from another source and\r\nby a different dynasty, the mere establishment of the representative\r\nsystem, the simple return to liberty, would have sufficed to inflame and\r\nrouse up once more to combat the old race, the privileged orders. They\r\nexist amongst us; they live, speak, circulate, act, and influence from\r\none end of France to the other. Decimated and scattered by the\r\nConvention, seduced and kept under by Napoleon, as soon as terror and\r\ndespotism cease (and neither are durable) they re-appear, resume\r\nposition, and labour to recover all that they have lost.... We have\r\nconquered the old system, we shall always conquer it; but for a long\r\ntime still we shall have to combat with it. Whoever wishes to see\r\nconstitutional order established in France, free elections, independent\r\nChambers, a tribune, liberty of the press, and all other public\r\nliberties, must abandon the idea that, in this perpetual and animated\r\nmanifestation of all society, the counter-revolution can remain mute and\r\ninactive.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when I recapitulated, in terms so positive and\r\nforcible, the situation in which the Revolution, the Restoration, and\r\nthe Charter had placed France, I foresaw that my words and ideas might\r\nbe perverted to the advantage of revolutionary passions; and to confine\r\nthem within their just interpretation, I hastened to add, \"In saying\r\nthat, since the origin of our monarchy, the struggle between two races\r\nhas agitated France, and that the Revolution has been merely the triumph\r\nof new conquerors over the ancient possessors of power and territory, I\r\nhave not sought to establish any historical filiation, or to maintain\r\nthat the double fact of conquest and servitude was perpetual, constant,\r\nand identical through all ages. Such an assertion would be evidently\r\nfalsified by realities. During this long progression of time, the\r\nvictors and the vanquished, the possessors and the possessions--the two\r\nraces, in fact--have become connected, displaced, and confounded; in\r\ntheir existence and relations they have undergone innumerable\r\nvicissitudes. Justice, the total absence of which would speedily\r\nannihilate all society, has introduced itself into the effects of power.\r\nIt has protected the weak, restrained the strong, regulated their\r\nintercourse, and has progressively substituted order for violence, and\r\nequality for oppression. It has rendered France, in fact, such as the\r\nworld has seen her, with her immeasurable glory and her intervals of\r\nrepose. But it is not the less true that throughout thirteen centuries,\r\nby the result of conquest and feudalism, France has always retained two\r\npositions, two social classes, profoundly distinct and unequal, which\r\nhave never become amalgamated or placed in a condition of mutual\r\nunderstanding and harmony; which have never ceased to combat, the one to\r\nconquer right, the other to retain privilege. In this our history is\r\ncomprised; and in this sense I have spoken of two races, victors and\r\nvanquished, friends and enemies; and of the war, sometimes open and\r\nsanguinary, at others internal and purely political, which these two\r\nconflicting interests have mutually waged against each other.\"\r\n\r\nOn reading over these pages at the present day, and my entire work of\r\n1820, I retain the impression, which I still desire to establish. On\r\nexamining things closely and by themselves, as an historian and\r\nphilosopher, I scarcely find any passage to alter. I continue to think\r\nthat the general ideas therein expressed are just, the great social\r\nfacts properly estimated, the political personages well understood and\r\ndrawn with fidelity. As an incidental polemic, the work is too positive\r\nand harsh; I do not sufficiently consider difficulties and clouds; I\r\ncondemn situations and parties too strongly; I require too much from\r\nmen; I have too little temperance, foresight, and patience. At that time\r\nI was too exclusively possessed by the spirit of opposition.\r\n\r\nEven then I suspected this myself; and perhaps the success I obtained\r\ninspired the doubt. I am not naturally disposed to opposition; and the\r\nmore I have advanced in life, the more I have become convinced that it\r\nis a part too easy and too dangerous. Success demands but little merit,\r\nwhile considerable virtue is requisite to resist the external and innate\r\nattractions. In 1820, I had as yet only filled an indirect and secondary\r\nposition under the Government; nevertheless I fully understood the\r\ndifficulty of governing, and felt a degree of repugnance in adding to it\r\nby attacking those to whom power was delegated. Another conviction began\r\nalso from that time to impress itself upon me. In modern society, when\r\nliberty is displayed, the strife becomes too unequal between the party\r\nthat governs and those who criticize Government. With the one rests all\r\nthe burden and unlimited responsibility; nothing is looked over or\r\nforgiven: with the others there is perfect liberty and no\r\nresponsibility; everything that they say or do is accepted and\r\ntolerated. Such is the public disposition, at least in France as soon as\r\nwe become free. At a later period, and when in office, I endured the\r\nweight of this myself; but I may acknowledge without any personal\r\nreluctance, that while in Opposition I first perceived the unjust and\r\ninjurious tendency of this feeling.\r\n\r\nBy instinct, rather than from any reflective or calculated intention, I\r\nconceived the desire, as soon as I had committed an act of declared\r\nhostility, of demonstrating what spirit of government was not foreign to\r\nmy own views. Many sensible men inclined to think that from the\r\nrepresentative system, in France at least, and in the state in which\r\nthe Revolution had left us, no sound plan could emanate, and that our\r\nardent longings for free institutions were only calculated to enervate\r\npower and promote anarchy. The Revolutionary and Imperial eras had\r\nnaturally bequeathed this idea; France had only become acquainted with\r\npolitical liberty by revolutions, and with order by despotism; harmony\r\nbetween them appeared to be a chimera. I undertook to prove, not only\r\nthat this chimera of great minds might become a reality, but that the\r\nrealization depended upon ourselves; for the system founded by the\r\nCharter alone contained, for us, the essential means of regular\r\ngovernment and of effective opposition, which the sincere friends of\r\npower and liberty could desire. My work, entitled, 'On the Means of\r\nGovernment and Opposition in the Actual State of France,' was entirely\r\ndedicated to this object.\r\n\r\nIn that treatise I entered into no general or theoretic exposition of\r\npolicy, the idea of which I expressly repudiated. \"Perhaps,\" I said, in\r\nmy preface, \"I may on some future occasion discuss more general\r\nquestions of predominant interest in regard to the nature and principles\r\nof constitutional government, although their solution has nothing to do\r\nwith existing politics, with the events and actors of the moment. I wish\r\nnow to speak only of power as it is, and of the best method of governing\r\nour great and beautiful country.\" Entirely a novice and doctrinarian as\r\nI then was, I forgot that the same maxims and arts of government must be\r\nequally good everywhere, and that all nations and ages are, at the same\r\nmoment, cast in a similar mould. I confined myself sedulously to my own\r\ntime and country, endeavouring to show what effective means of\r\ngovernment were included in the true principles and regular exercise of\r\nthe institutions which France held from the Charter, and how they might\r\nbe successfully put in practice for the legitimate advantage and\r\nstrengthening of power. With respect to the means of opposition, I\r\nfollowed the same line of argument, convinced myself, and anxious to\r\npersuade the adversaries of the then dominant policy, that authority\r\nmight be controlled without destroying it, and that the rights of\r\nliberty might be exercised without shaking the foundations of\r\nestablished order. It was my strong desire and prepossession to elevate\r\nthe political arena above the revolutionary track, and to imbue the\r\nheart of the constitutional system with ideas of strong and legal\r\nconservatism.\r\n\r\nThirty-six years have since rolled on. During this long interval I\r\nparticipated, for eighteen of those years, in the efforts of my\r\ngeneration for the establishment of a free government. For some time I\r\nsustained the weight of this labour. That government has been\r\noverthrown. Thus I have myself experienced the immense difficulty, and\r\nendured the painful failure, of this great enterprise. Nevertheless, and\r\nI say it without sceptical hesitation or affected modesty, I read over\r\nagain today what I wrote in 1821, upon the means of government and\r\nopposition in the actual state of France, with almost unmingled\r\nsatisfaction. I required much from power, but nothing, I believe, that\r\nwas not both capable and necessary of accomplishment. And\r\nnotwithstanding my young confidence, I remembered, even then, that other\r\nconditions were essential to success. \"I have no intention,\" I wrote,\r\n\"to impute everything to, and demand everything from, power itself. I\r\nshall not say to it, as has often been said, 'Be just, wise, firm, and\r\nfear nothing;' power is not free to exercise this inherent and\r\nindividual excellence. It does not make society, it finds it; and if\r\nsociety is impotent to second power, if the spirit of anarchy prevails,\r\nif the causes of dissolution exist in its own bosom, power will operate\r\nin vain; it is not given to human wisdom to rescue a people who refuse\r\nto co-operate in their own safety.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I published these two attacks upon the attitude and tendencies of\r\nthe Cabinet, conspiracies and political prosecutions burst forth from\r\nday to day, and entailed their tragical consequences. I have already\r\nsaid what I thought on the plots of that epoch, and why I considered\r\nthem as ill based, as badly conducted, without legitimate motives or\r\neffectual means. But while I condemned them, I respected the sincere and\r\ncourageous devotion of so many men, the greater part of whom were very\r\nyoung, and who, though mistaken, lavished the treasures of their minds\r\nand lives upon a cause which they believed to be just. Amongst the\r\ntrials of our time, I scarcely recognize any more painful than that of\r\nthese conflicting feelings, these perplexities between esteem and\r\ncensure, condemnation and sympathy, which I have so often been compelled\r\nto bestow on the acts of so many of my contemporaries. I love harmony\r\nand light in the human soul as well as in human associations; and we\r\nlive in an epoch of confusion and obscurity, moral as well as social.\r\n\r\nHow many men have I known, who, gifted with noble qualities, would in\r\nother times have led just and simple lives, but who, in our days,\r\nconfounded in the problems and shadows of their own thoughts, have\r\nbecome ambitious, turbulent, and fanatical, not knowing either how to\r\nattain their object or how to continue in repose!\r\n\r\nIn 1820, although still young myself, I lamented this agitation of minds\r\nand destinies, almost as sad to contemplate as fatal to be engaged in;\r\nbut while deploring it, I was divided between severe judgment and\r\nlenient emotion, and, without seeking to disarm power in its legitimate\r\ndefence, I felt a deep anxiety to inspire it with generous and prudent\r\nequity towards such adversaries.\r\n\r\nA true sentiment does not readily believe itself impotent. The two works\r\nwhich I published in 1821 and 1822, entitled, the first, 'On\r\nConspiracies and Political Justice,' and the second, 'On Capital\r\nPunishment for Political Offences,' were not, on my part, acts of\r\nopposition; I endeavoured to divest them of this character. To mark\r\ndistinctly their meaning and object, it will suffice for me to repeat\r\ntheir respective epigraphs. On the title-page of the first I inscribed\r\nthis passage from the prophet Isaiah: \"Say ye not, _a confederacy_, to\r\nall them to whom this people shall say, _a confederacy_;\" and on that of\r\nthe second, the words of St. Paul: \"O death, where is thy sting? O\r\ngrave, where is thy victory?\" What I chiefly desired was to convince\r\npower itself that sound policy and true justice called for very rare\r\nexamples of trial and execution in political cases; and that in\r\nexercising against all offenders the utmost severity of the laws, it\r\ncreated more perils than it subdued. Public opinion was in accordance\r\nwith mine; sensible and independent men, taking no part in the passions\r\nof the parties engaged in this struggle, found, as I did, that there was\r\nexcess in the action of the police with reference to these plots, excess\r\nin the number and severity of the prosecutions, excess in the\r\napplication of legal penalties. I carefully endeavoured to restrain\r\nthese complaints within their just limits, to avoid all injurious\r\ncomparisons, all attempts at sudden reforms, and to concede to power its\r\nnecessary weapons. While discussing these questions, which had sprung up\r\nin the bosom of the most violent storms, I sought to transfer them to an\r\nelevated and temperate region, convinced that by that course alone my\r\nideas and words would acquire any permanent efficacy. They obtained the\r\nsanction of a much more potent ally than myself. The Court of Peers,\r\nwhich at that time had assumed the place assigned to it by the Charter,\r\nin judgment on political prosecutions, immediately began to exercise\r\nsound policy and true discrimination. It was a rare and imposing sight,\r\nto behold a great assembly, essentially political in origin and\r\ncomposition,--a faithful supporter of authority; and at the same time\r\nsedulously watchful, not only to elevate justice above the passions of\r\nthe moment, and to administer it with perfect independence, but also to\r\napply, in the appreciation and punishment of political offences, that\r\nintelligent equity which alone could satisfy the reason of the\r\nphilosopher and the charity of the Christian. A part of the honour due\r\nto this grand exhibition belongs to the authorities the time, who not\r\nonly made no attempt to interfere with the unshackled impartiality of\r\nthe Court of Peers, but refrained even from objection or complaint.\r\nNext to the merit of being themselves, and through their own\r\nconvictions, just and wise, it is a real act of wisdom on the part of\r\nthe great ones of the earth, when they adopt without murmur or\r\nhesitation the good which has not originated with themselves.\r\n\r\nI have lived in an age of political plots and outrages, directed\r\nalternately against the authorities to whom I was in opposition and\r\nthose I supported with ardour. I have seen conspiracies occasionally\r\nunpunished, and at other times visited by the utmost rigour of the law.\r\nI feel thoroughly convinced that in the existing state of feelings,\r\nminds, and manners, the punishment of death in such cases is an\r\ninjurious weapon which heavily wounds the power that uses it for safety.\r\nIt is not that this penalty is without denunciatory and preventive\r\nefficacy; it terrifies and holds back from conspiracies many who would\r\notherwise be tempted to engage in them. But by the side of this salutary\r\nconsequence, it engenders others which are most injurious. Drawing no\r\nline of distinction between the motives and dispositions which have\r\nincited men to the acts it punishes, it stifles in the same manner the\r\nreprobate and the dreamer, the criminal and the enthusiast, the wildly\r\nambitious and the devotedly fanatical. By this gross indifference, it\r\noffends more than it satisfies moral feeling, irritates more than it\r\nrestrains, moves indifferent spectators to pity, and appears to those\r\nwho are interested an act of war falsely invested with the forms of a\r\ndecree of justice. The intimidation which it conveys at first,\r\ndiminishes from day to day; while the hatred and thirst of vengeance it\r\ninspires become hourly more intense and expansive; and at last the time\r\narrives when the power which fancies itself saved is exposed to the\r\nattacks of enemies infinitely more numerous and formidable than those\r\nwho have been previously disposed of.\r\n\r\nA day will also come, I confidently feel, when, for offences exclusively\r\npolitical, the penalties of banishment and transportation, carefully\r\ngraduated and applied, will be substituted in justice as well as in fact\r\nfor the punishment of death. Meanwhile I reckon, amongst the most\r\nagreeable reminiscences of my life, the fact of my having strenuously\r\ndirected true justice and good policy to this subject, at a moment when\r\nboth were seriously compromised by party passions and the dangers to\r\nwhich power was exposed.\r\n\r\nThese four works, published successively within the space of two years,\r\nattracted a considerable share of public attention. The leading members\r\nof Opposition in the two Chambers thanked me as for a service rendered\r\nto the cause of France and free institutions. \"You win battles for us\r\nwithout our help,\" said General Foy to me. M. Royer-Collard, in pointing\r\nout some objections to the first of these Essays ('On the Government of\r\nFrance since the Restoration'), added, \"Your book is full of truths; we\r\ncollect them with a shovel.\" I repeat without hesitation these\r\ntestimonies of real approbation. When we seriously undertake to advocate\r\npolitical measures, either in speeches or publications, it becomes most\r\nessential to attain our object. Praise is doubly valuable when it\r\nconveys the certainty of success. This certainty once established, I\r\ncare little for mere compliments, from which a certain degree of\r\npuerility and ridicule is inseparable; sympathy without affected words\r\nhas alone a true and desirable charm. I had a right to set some value on\r\nthat which the Opposition evinced towards me; for I had done nothing to\r\ngratify the passions or conciliate the prejudices and after-thoughts\r\nwhich fermented in the extreme ranks of the party.\r\n\r\nI had as frankly supported royalty, as I had opposed the Cabinet; and it\r\nwas evident that I had no desire to consign either the House of Bourbon\r\nor the Charter to their respective enemies.\r\n\r\nTwo opportunities soon presented themselves of explaining myself on this\r\npoint in a more personal and precise manner. In 1821, a short time after\r\nthe publication of my 'Essay on Conspiracies and Political Justice,' one\r\nof the leaders of the conspiring faction, a man of talent and honour,\r\nbut deeply implicated in secret societies, that inheritance of\r\ntyrannical times which becomes the poison of freedom, came to see me,\r\nand expressed with much warmth his grateful acknowledgments. The boldest\r\nconspirators feel gratified, when danger threatens, by shielding\r\nthemselves under the principles of justice and moderation professed by\r\nmen who take no part in their plots. We conversed freely on all topics.\r\nAs he was about to leave me, my visitor, grasping me by the arm,\r\nexclaimed, \"Become one of ours!\"--\"Who do you call yours?\"--\"Enter with\r\nus into the _Charbonnerie_; it is the only association capable of\r\noverthrowing the Government by which we are humiliated and\r\noppressed.\"--I replied, \"You deceive yourself, as far as I am concerned;\r\nI do not feel humiliation or oppression either for myself or my\r\ncountry.\"--\"What can you hope from the people now in power?\"--\"It is not\r\na question of hope; I wish to preserve what we possess; we have all we\r\nrequire to establish a free government for ourselves. Actual power\r\nconstantly calls for resistance. In my opinion it does so at this\r\nmoment, but not to the extent of being subverted. It is very far from\r\nhaving done anything to give us either the right or the means of\r\nproceeding to that extremity. We have legal and public arms in abundance\r\nto produce reform by opposition. I neither desire your object nor your\r\nmethod of attaining it; you will bring much mischief on all, yourselves\r\nincluded, without success; and if you should succeed, matters would be\r\nstill worse.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away without anger, for he felt a friendship for me; but I had\r\nnot in the slightest degree shaken his passion for plots and secret\r\nsocieties. It is a fever which admits of no cure, when the soul is once\r\ngiven up to it, and a yoke not to be thrown off when it has been long\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nA little later, in 1822, when the publications I have spoken of had\r\nproduced their effect, I received one day a visit from M. Manuel. We had\r\noccasionally met at the houses of mutual friends, and lived on terms of\r\ngood understanding without positive intimacy. He evidently came to\r\npropose closer acquaintanceship, with an openness in which perhaps the\r\nsomewhat restricted character of his mind was as much displayed as the\r\nfirmness of his temperament; he passed at once from compliments to\r\nconfidence, and, after congratulating me on my opposition, opened to me\r\nthe full bearing of his own. He neither believed in the Restoration nor\r\nthe Charter, held the House of Bourbon to be incompatible with the\r\nFrance of the Revolution, and looked upon a change of dynasty as a\r\nnecessary consequence of the total alteration in the social system. He\r\nintroduced, in the course of our interview, the recent death of the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, the security which thence resulted to the peace of\r\nEurope, and the name of Napoleon II. as a possible and perhaps the best\r\nsolution of the problems involved in our future. All this was expressed\r\nin guarded but sufficiently definite terms, equally without passion or\r\ncircumlocution, and with a marked intention of ascertaining to what\r\nextent I should admit or reject the prospects on which he enlarged. I\r\nwas unprepared, both for the visit and the conversation; but I stood on\r\nno reserve, not expecting to convert M. Manuel to my own views, and with\r\nno desire to conceal mine from him. \"Far from thinking,\" I said in\r\nreply, \"that a change of dynasty is necessary for France, I should look\r\nupon it as a great misfortune and a formidable peril. I consider the\r\nRevolution of 1789 to be satisfied as well as finished. In the Charter\r\nit possesses all the guarantees that its interests and legitimate\r\nobjects require. I have no fear of a counter-revolution. We hold against\r\nit the power of right as well as of fact; and if people were ever mad\r\nenough to attempt it, we should always find sufficient strength to\r\narrest their progress. What France requires at present is to expel the\r\nrevolutionary spirit which still torments her, and to exercise the free\r\nsystem of which she is in full possession. The House of Bourbon is\r\nextremely well suited to this double exigence of the country. Its\r\ngovernment is anti-revolutionary by nature, and liberal through\r\nnecessity. I should much dread a power which, while maintaining order,\r\nwould either in fact or appearance be sufficiently revolutionary to\r\ndispense with being liberal. I should be apprehensive that the country\r\nwould too easily lend itself to such a rule. We require to be a little\r\nuneasy as regards our interests, that we may learn how to maintain our\r\nrights. The Restoration satisfies while it keeps us on our guard. It\r\nacts at the same time as a spur and a bridle. Both are good for us. I\r\nknow not what would happen if we were without either.\" M. Manuel pressed\r\nme no longer; he had too much sense to waste time in useless words. We\r\ncontinued to discourse without further argument, and parted thinking\r\nwell, I believe, of each other, but both thoroughly satisfied that we\r\nshould never act in concert.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the publication of these different treatises, I was\r\nalso preparing my course of lectures on Modern History, which I\r\ncommenced on the 7th of December, 1820. Determined to make use of the\r\ntwo influential organs with which public instruction and the press\r\nsupplied me, I used them nevertheless in a very different manner. In my\r\nlectures, I excluded all reference to the circumstances, system, or acts\r\nof the Government; I checked every inclination to attack or even to\r\ncriticize, and banished all remembrance of the affairs or contests of\r\nthe moment. I scrupulously restrained myself within the sphere of\r\ngeneral ideas and by-gone facts. Intellectual independence is the\r\nnatural privilege of science, which would be lost if converted into an\r\ninstrument of political opposition. For the effective display of\r\ndifferent liberties, it is necessary that each should be confined within\r\nits own domain; their strength and security depend on this prudent\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nWhile imposing on myself this line of conduct, I did not evade the\r\ndifficulty. I selected for the subject of my course the history of the\r\nold political institutions of Christian Europe, and of the origin of\r\nrepresentative government, in the different forms in which it had been\r\nformerly attempted, with or without success. I touched very closely, in\r\nsuch a subject, on the flagrant embarrassments of that contemporaneous\r\npolicy to which I was determined to make no allusion. But I also found\r\nan obvious opportunity of carrying out, through scientific paths alone,\r\nthe double object I had in view. I was anxious to combat revolutionary\r\ntheories, and to attach interest and respect to the past history of\r\nFrance. We had scarcely emerged from the most furious struggle against\r\nthat old French society, our secular cradle; our hearts, if not still\r\noverflowing with anger, were indifferent towards it, and our minds were\r\nconfusedly imbued with the ideas, true or false, under which it had\r\nfallen. The time had come for clearing out that arena covered with\r\nruins, and for substituting, in thought as in fact, equity for\r\nhostility, and the principles of liberty for the arms of the Revolution.\r\nAn edifice is not built with machines of war; neither can a free system\r\nbe founded on ignorant prejudices and inveterate antipathies. I\r\nencountered, at every step throughout my course, the great problems of\r\nsocial organization, under the name of which parties and classes\r\nexchanged such heavy blows,--the sovereignty of the people and the\r\nright divine of kings, monarchy and republicanism, aristocracy and\r\ndemocracy, the unity or division of power, the various systems of\r\nelection, constitution, and action of the assemblies called to\r\nco-operate in government. I entered upon all these questions with a firm\r\ndetermination to sift thoroughly the ideas of our own time, and to\r\nseparate revolutionary excitement and fantasies from the advances of\r\njustice and liberty, reconcilable with the eternal laws of social order.\r\nBy the side of this philosophic undertaking, I pursued another,\r\nexclusively historical; I endeavoured to demonstrate the intermitting\r\nbut always recurring efforts of French society to emerge from the\r\nviolent chaos in which it had been originally formed, sometimes produced\r\nby the conflict, and at others by the accordance of its different\r\nelements--royalty, nobility, clergy, citizens, and people,--throughout\r\nthe different phases of that harsh destiny, and the glorious although\r\nincomplete development of French civilization, such as the Revolution\r\nhad compiled it after so many combats and vicissitudes. I particularly\r\nwished to associate old France with the remembrance and intelligence of\r\nnew generations; for there was as little sense as justice in decrying or\r\ndespising our fathers, at the very moment when, equally misled in our\r\ntime, we were taking an immense step in the same path which they had\r\nfollowed for so many ages.\r\n\r\nI expounded these ideas before an audience little disposed to adopt or\r\neven to take any interest in them. The public who at that time attended\r\nmy lectures were much less numerous and varied than they became some\r\nyears later. They consisted chiefly of young men, pupils of the\r\ndifferent scientific schools, and of a few curious amateurs of great\r\nhistorical disquisitions. The one class were not prepared for the\r\nquestions I proposed, and wanted the preparatory knowledge which would\r\nhave rendered them acceptable. With many of the rest, preconceived ideas\r\nof the eighteenth century and the Revolution, in matters of historical\r\nand political philosophy, had already acquired that strength, derived\r\nfrom inveterate habit, which rejects discussion, and listens coldly and\r\ndistrustfully to all that differs from their own opinions. Others again,\r\nand amongst these were the most active and accessible dispositions, were\r\nmore or less engaged in the secret societies, hostile intrigues and\r\nplots. With these, my opposition was considered extremely supine. I had\r\nthus many obstacles to surmount, and many conversions to effect, before\r\nI could bring over to my own views the small circle that listened to my\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nBut there is always, in a French audience, whatever may be their\r\nprejudices, an intellectual elasticity, a relish for efforts of the mind\r\nand new ideas boldly set forward, and a certain liberal equity, which\r\ndisposes them to sympathize, even though they may hesitate to admit\r\nconviction. I was at the same time liberal and anti-revolutionary,\r\ndevoted to the fundamental principles of the new French social system,\r\nand animated by an affectionate respect for our ancient reminiscences. I\r\nwas opposed to the ideas which constituted the political faith of the\r\ngreater portion of my auditors. I propounded others which appeared\r\nsuspicious to them, even while they seemed just; they considered me as\r\nmade up of obscurities, contradictions, and prospective views, which\r\nastonished and made them hesitate to follow me. At the same time they\r\nfelt that I was serious and sincere; they became gradually convinced\r\nthat my historic impartiality was not indifference, nor my political\r\ncreed a leaning towards the old system, nor my opposition to every kind\r\nof subversive plot a truckling complaisance for power. I gained ground\r\nin the estimation of my listeners: some amongst the most distinguished\r\ncame decidedly over to my views; others began to entertain doubts on the\r\nsoundness of their theories and the utility of their conspiring\r\npractices; nearly all agreed with my just appreciation of the past, and\r\nmy recommendation of patient and legal opposition to the mistakes of the\r\npresent. The revolutionary spirit in this young and ardent section of\r\nthe public was visibly on the decline, not from scepticism and apathy,\r\nbut because other ideas and sentiments occupied its place in their\r\nhearts, and drove it out to make room for their own admission.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of 1822 thought differently. It looked upon my lectures as\r\ndangerous; and on the 12th of October in that year, the Abbe\r\nFrayssinous, who a few months before had been appointed by M. de Villele\r\nHead Master of the University, commanded me to suspend them. I made no\r\ncomplaint at the time, and I am not now astonished at the measure. My\r\nopposition to the Ministry was unconcealed, and although not in the\r\nslightest degree mixed up with my course of public instruction, many\r\npersons were unable to separate as distinctly as I did, in their\r\nimpressions, my lectures on the history of past ages from my writings\r\nagainst the policy of the day. I am equally convinced that the\r\nGovernment, by sanctioning this proceeding, deceived itself to its own\r\ndetriment. In the struggle which it maintained with the spirit of\r\nrevolution, the ideas I propagated in my teaching were more salutary\r\nthan the opposition I carried on through the press was injurious; they\r\nadded more strength to the monarchy, than my criticisms on incidental\r\nquestions and situations could abstract from the Cabinet. But my free\r\nlanguage disturbed the blind partisans of absolute power in the Church\r\nand State, and the Abbe Frayssinous, short-witted and weak though\r\nhonest, obeyed with inquietude rather than reluctance the influences\r\nwhose extreme violence he dreaded without condemning their exercise.\r\n\r\nIn the division of the monarchical parties, that which I had opposed\r\nplunged more and more into exclusive and extreme measures. My lectures\r\nbeing interdicted, all immediate political influence became impossible\r\nto me. To struggle, beyond the circle of the Chambers, against the\r\nexisting system, it was necessary either to conspire, or to descend to a\r\nblind, perverse, and futile opposition. Neither of these courses were\r\nagreeable; I therefore completely renounced all party contentions, even\r\nphilosophical and abstracted, to seek elsewhere the means of still\r\nmentally serving my cause with reference to the future.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more difficult and at the same time more important in\r\npublic life, than to know how at certain moments to resign ourselves to\r\ninaction without renouncing final success, and to wait patiently without\r\nyielding to despair.\r\n\r\nIt was at this epoch that I applied myself seriously to the study of\r\nEngland, her institutions, and the long contests on which they were\r\nfounded. Enthusiastically devoted to the political future of my own\r\ncountry, I wished to learn accurately through what realities and\r\nmistakes, by what persevering efforts and prudent acts, a great nation\r\nhad succeeded in establishing and preserving a free government. When we\r\ncompare attentively the history and social development of France and\r\nEngland, we find it difficult to decide by which we ought to be most\r\nimpressed,--the differences or the resemblances. Never have two\r\ncountries, with origin and position so totally distinct, been more\r\ndeeply associated in their respective destinies, or exercised upon each\r\nother, by the alternate relations of peace and war, such continued\r\ninfluence. A province of France conquered England; England for a long\r\ntime held possession of several provinces of France; and on the\r\nconclusion of this national strife, already the institutions and\r\npolitical wisdom of the English were, with the most political spirits of\r\nthe French, with Louis XI. and Philip de Comines, for example, subjects\r\nof admiration. In the bosom of Christianity the two nations have served\r\nunder different religious standards; but this very distinction has\r\nbecome between them a new cause of contact and intermixture. In England\r\nthe French Protestants, and in France the persecuted English Catholics,\r\nhave sought and found an asylum. And when kings have been proscribed in\r\ntheir turn, in France the monarch of England, and in England the\r\nsovereign of France, was received and protected. From these respective\r\nhavens of safety, Charles II., in the seventeenth century, and Louis\r\nXVIII. in the nineteenth, departed to resume their dominions. The two\r\nnations, or, to speak more correctly, the high classes of the two\r\nnations, have mutually adopted ideas, manners, and fashions from each\r\nother. In the seventeenth century, the court of Louis XIV. gave the tone\r\nto the English aristocracy. In the eighteenth, Paris went to London in\r\nsearch of models. And when we ascend above these historical incidents to\r\nconsider the great phases of civilization in the two countries, we find\r\nthat, after considerable intervals in the course of ages, they have\r\nfollowed nearly the same career; and that similar attempts and\r\nalternations of order and revolution, of absolute power and liberty,\r\nhave occurred in both, with singular coincidences and equally remarkable\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, on a very superficial and erroneous survey that some\r\npersons look upon French and English society as so essentially\r\ndifferent, that the one could not draw political examples from the other\r\nexcept by factitious and barren imitations. Nothing is more completely\r\nfalsified by true history, and more opposed to the natural bias of the\r\ntwo countries. Their very rivalries have never broken the ties, apparent\r\nor concealed, that exist between them; and, whether they know or are\r\nignorant of it, whether they acknowledge or deny the fact, they cannot\r\navoid being powerfully acted upon, by each other; their ideas, their\r\nmanners, and their institutions intermingle and modify mutually, as if\r\nby an amicable necessity.\r\n\r\nLet me at the same time admit, without hesitation, that we have\r\nsometimes borrowed from England too completely and precipitately. We\r\nhave not sufficiently calculated the true character and social condition\r\nof French society. France has increased and prospered under the\r\ninfluence of royalty seconding the ascending movement of the middle\r\nclasses; England, by the action of the landed aristocracy, taking under\r\nits charge the liberties of the people. These distinctions are too\r\nmarked to disappear, even under the controlling uniformity of modern\r\ncivilization. We have too thoroughly forgotten them. It is the rock and\r\nimpediment in the way of innovations accomplished under the name of\r\ngeneral ideas and great examples, that they do not assume their\r\nlegitimate part in real and national facts. But how could we have\r\nescaped this rock? In the course of her long existence, ancient France\r\nhas made, at several regular intervals, great efforts to obtain free\r\ngovernment. The most powerful influences have either resisted, or failed\r\nin the attempt; her best institutions have not co-operated with the\r\nnecessary changes, or have remained politically ineffective;\r\nnevertheless, by a just sentiment of her honour as of her interest,\r\nFrance has never ceased to aspire to a true and permanent system of\r\npolitical guarantees and liberties. She demanded and desired this system\r\nin 1789. Through what channels was it sought? From what institution was\r\nit expected? So often deceived in her hopes and attempts within, she\r\nlooked beyond home for lessons and models,--a great additional obstacle\r\nto a work already so difficult, but an inevitable one imposed by\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, I was far from estimating the obstacles which beset us in our\r\nlabour of constitutional organization as correctly as I do now. I was\r\nimpressed with the idea that our predecessors of 1789 had held old\r\nFrance, her social traditions and her habits, in too much contempt; and\r\nthat to bring back harmony with liberty into our country, we ought to\r\nlay more stress on our glorious past. At the same moment, therefore,\r\nwhen I placed before the eyes of the French public the history and\r\noriginal monuments of the institutions and revolutions of England, I\r\nentered with ardour into the study and exposition of the early state of\r\nFrench society, its origin, laws, and different gradations of\r\ndevelopment. I was equally desirous to give to my readers information on\r\na great foreign history, and to revive amongst them a taste and\r\ninclination for the study of our own.\r\n\r\nMy labours were certainly in accord with the instincts and requirements\r\nof the time; for they were received and seconded by the general movement\r\nwhich then manifested itself in the public mind, and with reference to\r\nthe Government so much a subject of dispute. It is the happy tendency of\r\nthe French temperament to change the direction of its course without\r\nslackening speed. It is singularly flexible, elastic, and prolific. An\r\nobstacle impedes it, it opens another path; if burdened by fetters, it\r\nstill walks on while bearing them; if restrained on a given point, it\r\nleaves it, and rebounds elsewhere. The Government of the right-hand\r\nparty restrained political life and action within a narrow circle, and\r\nrendered them more difficult; the generation which was then beginning to\r\nstir in the world, sought, not entirely independent of, but side by side\r\nwith politics, the employment of its strength and the gratification of\r\nits desires: literature, philosophy, history, policy, and criticism\r\nassumed a new and powerful flight. While a natural and unfortunate\r\nreaction brought back into the field of combat the eighteenth century\r\nwith its old weapons, the nineteenth displayed itself with its original\r\nideas, tendencies, and features.\r\n\r\nI do not quote particular names; those which deserve to be remembered\r\nrequire no repetition; it is the general character of the intellectual\r\nmovement of the period that I wish to bring into light. This movement\r\nwas neither exclusively nor directly applied to politics, yet it was\r\nfrom politics that it emanated; it was both literary and philosophic:\r\nthe human mind, disengaging itself from the interests and disputes of\r\nthe day, pressed forward through every path that presented itself, in\r\nthe search and enjoyment of the true and beautiful; but the first\r\nimpulse came from political liberty, and the hope of contributing to the\r\nestablishment of a free system was plainly perceptible in the most\r\nabstract labours as in the most poetic flights. My friends and I, while\r\noriginating in 1827 one of the leading periodicals of the age, the\r\n'Revue Francaise,' selected for its motto this verse of Ovid,--\r\n\r\n   \"Et quod nunc ratio est, impetus ante fuit:\"--\r\n\r\n\"What is now reason, was at first an impulse of passion.\"\r\n\r\nWe thus truly conveyed the prevailing spirit around us, and our own\r\npersonal conviction. The 'Revue Francaise' was devoted to philosophy,\r\nhistory, literary criticism, and moral and scientific lucubrations; at\r\nthe same time it was impregnated with the grand political inspirations\r\nwhich for forty years had agitated France. We declared ourselves\r\ndistinct from our precursors of 1789, strangers to their passions, and\r\nnot enslaved to their ideas, but inheritors and continuators of their\r\nwork. We undertook to bring back the new French society to purer\r\nprinciples, to more elevated and equitable sentiments, and to firmer\r\nfoundations; to that great subject of interest, to the accomplishment of\r\nits legitimate hopes and the assurance of its liberties, our efforts and\r\ndesires were incessantly directed.\r\n\r\nAnother miscellany, commenced in 1824, and more popular than the\r\n'Revue'--the 'Globe'--bore the same features in a polemic of greater\r\nanimation and variety. Some young doctrinarians, associated with other\r\nwriters of the same class, and animated by the same spirit, although\r\nwith primary ideas and ultimate tendencies of a very different\r\ncharacter, were the ordinary editors. Their distinguishing symbols were,\r\nin philosophy, spiritualism; in history, intelligent inquiry, impartial\r\nand even sympathetic as regarded ancient times and the progressive\r\nconditions of human society; in literature, a taste for novelty,\r\nvariety, liberty, and truth, even under the strangest forms and the most\r\nincongruous associations. They defended, or rather advanced their banner\r\nwith the ardour and pride of youth; enjoying, in their attempts at\r\nphilosophical, historical, poetical, and critical reform, the\r\nsatisfaction, at once personal and disinterested, which forms the\r\nsweetest reward of intellectual activity; and promising themselves, as\r\nalways happens, a too extensive and too easy success. Two faults were\r\nmingled with these generous aspirations: the ideas developed in the\r\n'Globe' were deficient in a fixed basis and a defined limit; their form\r\nwas more decided than their foundation; they exhibited minds animated by\r\na noble impulse, but not directed to any single or certain end; and open\r\nto an easy, unrestricted course, which excited apprehension that they\r\nmight themselves drift towards the rocks they cautioned others to avoid.\r\nAt the same time the spirit of partisanship, inclining men to be wrapped\r\nup and isolated in the narrow circle of their immediate associates,\r\nwithout remembering the general public for whom they labour and to whom\r\nthey speak, exercised too much influence in the pages of the 'Globe.'\r\nTurgot intended to write several articles for the 'Encyclopaedia.'\r\nD'Alembert came one day to ask him for them. Turgot declined: \"You\r\nincessantly say _we_,\" he replied; \"the public will soon say _you_; I do\r\nnot wish to be so enrolled and classed.\" But these faults of the\r\n'Globe,' apparent today, were concealed, thirty years ago, by the merit\r\nof its opposition; for political opposition was at the bottom of this\r\nmiscellany, and obtained favour for it with many in the party opposed to\r\nthe Restoration, to whom its philosophical and literary opinions were\r\nfar from acceptable. In February, 1830, under the ministry of\r\nM. de Polignac, the 'Globe,' yielding to its inclination, became\r\ndecidedly a great political journal; and from his retirement at\r\nCarquerannes, near Hyeres, where he had gone to reconcile his labour\r\nwith his health, M. Augustine Thierry wrote to me as follows:--\"What\r\nthink you of the 'Globe' since it has changed its character? I know not\r\nwhy I am vexed to find in it all those trifling points of news and daily\r\ndiscussion. Formerly we concentrated our thoughts to read it, but now\r\nthat is no longer possible; the attention is distracted and divided.\r\nThere are still the same spirit and the same articles, but it is\r\ndisagreeable to encounter by their side these commonplace and every-day\r\nmatters.\" M. Augustine Thierry was right. The 'Globe' sank materially by\r\nbecoming a political journal, like so many others; but it had not been\r\nthe less essentially political from its commencement, in tendency and\r\ninspiration. Such was the general spirit of the time; and, far from\r\navoiding this, the 'Globe' was deeply impregnated with it.\r\n\r\nEven under the controlling influence of the right-hand party, the\r\nRestoration made no attempt to stifle this actual but indirect\r\nopposition, which they felt to be troublesome though not openly hostile:\r\njustice requires that we should remember this to the credit of that\r\nepoch. In the midst of the constant alarms excited by political liberty\r\nand the efforts of power to restrain it, intellectual freedom maintained\r\nitself and commanded respect. This freedom does not supply all the rest;\r\nbut it prepares them, and, while their accomplishment is suspended,\r\npreserves the honour of nations who have not yet learned to conquer or\r\npreserve their rights.\r\n\r\nWhile this movement of the mind developed itself and gained strength\r\nfrom day to day, the Government of M. de Villele pursued its course,\r\nmore and more perplexed by the pretensions and quarrels of the party\r\nwhich its leader vainly endeavoured to restrain. One of my friends,\r\nendowed with penetrating and impartial judgment, thus wrote to me in\r\nDecember, 1826, from the interior of his department:--\"Men who are at\r\nthe head of a faction are really destined to tremble before their own\r\nshadow. I cannot recollect any time when this nullity of the ruling\r\nparty was more complete. They do not propound a single doctrine or\r\nconviction, or a hope for the future. Even declamation itself seems to\r\nbe exhausted and futile. Surely M. de Villele must be allowed the merit\r\nof being well acquainted with their helplessness; his success springs\r\nfrom that cause; but this I look upon as an instinctive knowledge: he\r\nrepresents without correctly estimating these people. Otherwise he would\r\ndiscover that he might refuse them everything except places and\r\nappointments; provided also that he lends himself to no connection with\r\nopposite opinions.\" When the party, proceeding from exigence to\r\nexigence, and the Cabinet from weakness to weakness, found themselves\r\nunable to act longer together,--when M. de Villele, in November 1827,\r\nappealed to an election for defence against his rivals in the Chamber\r\nand at Court,--we resolutely encountered our share in the contest. Every\r\nopposition combined. Under the motto, _Aide-toi, le Ciel t'aidera_,\r\n\"Help thyself, and Heaven will help thee,\" a public association was\r\nformed, in which was comprised men of very different general ideas and\r\ndefinitive intentions, who acted in concert with the sole design of\r\nbringing about, by legal measures, a change of the majority in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, and the fall of the Cabinet. I as readily joined\r\nthem, with my friends, as in 1815 I had repaired alone to Ghent to\r\nconvey to the King, Louis XVIII., the wishes of the constitutional\r\nRoyalists. Long revolutions engender two opposite vices, rashness and\r\npusillanimity; men learn from them either to plunge blindly into mad\r\nenterprises, or to abstain timidly from the most legitimate and\r\nnecessary actions. We had openly opposed the policy of the Cabinet; it\r\nnow challenged us to the electoral field to decide the quarrel: we\r\nentered it with the same frankness, resolved to look for nothing beyond\r\nfair elections, and to accept the difficulties and chances, at first of\r\nthe combat, and afterwards of the success, if success should attend our\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Biography' which Beranger has written of himself, I find this\r\nparagraph:--\"At all times I have relied too much on the people, to\r\napprove of secret associations, in reality permanent conspiracies, which\r\nuselessly compromise many persons, create a host of inferior rival\r\nambitions, and render questions of principle subordinate to private\r\npassions. They rapidly produce suspicion, an infallible cause of\r\ndefection and even of treachery, and end, when the labouring classes are\r\ncalled in to co-operate, by corrupting instead of enlightening them....\r\nThe society, _Aide-toi, le Ciel t'aidera_, which acted openly, has alone\r\nrendered true service to our cause.\" The cause of M. Beranger and ours\r\nwere totally distinct. Which of the two would profit most by the\r\nelectoral services derived from the society of _Aide-toi, le Ciel\r\nt'aidera_? The question was to be speedily solved by the King, Charles\r\nX.\r\n\r\nThe results of the election of 1827 were enormous; they greatly exceeded\r\nthe fears of the Cabinet and the hopes of the Opposition. I was still in\r\nthe country when these events became known. One of my friends wrote to\r\nme from Paris, \"The consternation of the Ministers, the nervous attack\r\nof M. de Villele, who sent for his physician at three o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the agony of M. de Corbieres,[18] the retreat of M. de Polignac\r\nto the country, from whence he has no intention to return, although he\r\nmay be vehemently requested to do so, the terror at the palace, the ever\r\nbrilliant shooting-parties of the King, the elections so completely\r\nunexpected, surprising, and astounding,--here are more than subjects\r\nenough to call for prophecies, and to give rise to false predictions on\r\nevery consequence that may be anticipated.\" The Duke de Broglie, absent,\r\nlike myself, from Paris, looked towards the future with more confident\r\nmoderation. \"It will be difficult,\" he wrote to me, \"for the general\r\nsound sense which has presided at these elections not to react, to a\r\ncertain extent, on the parties elected. The Ministry which will be\r\nformed during the first conflict, will be poor enough; but we must\r\nsupport it, and endeavour to suppress all alarm. It has already reached\r\nme here, that the elections have produced great apprehensions; if I am\r\nnot deceived, this terror is nothing more than a danger of the moment.\r\nIf, after the fall of the present Ministry, we are able to get through\r\nthe year quietly, we shall have won the victory.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Ministry of M. de Villele fell, and the Cabinet of\r\nM. de Martignac was installed, a new attempt at a Government of the\r\nCentre commenced, but with much less force, and inferior chances of\r\nsuccess, than that which in 1816 and 1821, under the combined and\r\nseparate directions of the Duke de Richelieu and M. Decazes, had\r\ndefended France and the crown against the supremacy of the right and\r\nleft-hand parties. The party of the centre, formed at that time under a\r\npressing danger of the country, had drawn much strength from that very\r\ncircumstance, and either from the right or the left had encountered\r\nnothing but animated opposition, but still raw and badly organized, and\r\nsuch as in public estimation was incapable of government. In 1828, on\r\nthe contrary, the right hand-party, only just ejected from power, after\r\nhaving held it for six years, believed that they were as near recovering\r\nas they were capable of exercising office, and attacked with exuberant\r\nhope the suddenly created successors who had stepped into their places.\r\nIn other quarters, the left and the left centre, brought into contact\r\nand almost confounded by six years of common opposition, reciprocated\r\nmutual understanding in their relations with a Cabinet which they were\r\ncalled on to support, although not emanating from their ranks. As it\r\nhappens in similar cases, the violent and extravagant members of the\r\nparty, paralyzed or committed the more moderate and rational to a much\r\ngreater extent than the latter were able to restrain and guide their\r\ntroublesome associates. Thus assailed in the Chambers by ambitious and\r\ninfluential rivals, the rising power found there only lukewarm or\r\nrestrained allies. While from 1816 to 1821 the King, Louis XVIII., gave\r\nhis sincere and active co-operation to the Government of the Centre, in\r\n1828 the King, Charles X., looked upon the Cabinet which replaced\r\nimmediately round him the leaders of the right-hand party as an\r\nunpleasant trial he was doomed to undergo; but to which he submitted\r\nwith uneasy reluctance, not believing in its success, and fully\r\ndetermined to endure it no longer than strict necessity compelled.\r\n\r\nIn this weak position, two individuals, M. de Martignac, as actual head\r\nof the Cabinet, without being president, and M. Royer-Collard, as\r\npresident of the Chamber of Deputies, alone contributed a small degree\r\nof strength and reputation to the new Ministry; but they were far from\r\nbeing equal to its difficulties or dangers.\r\n\r\nM. de Martignac has left on the minds of all who were acquainted with\r\nhim, either in public or private life, whether friends or adversaries, a\r\nstrong impression of esteem and goodwill. His disposition was easy,\r\namiable, and generous; his mind just, quick, and refined, at once calm\r\nand liberal; he was endowed with natural, persuasive, clear, and\r\ngraceful eloquence; he pleased even those from whom he differed. I have\r\nheard M. Dupont de l'Eure whisper gently from his place, while listening\r\nto him, \"Be silent, Siren!\" In ordinary times, and under a well-settled\r\nconstitutional system, he would have been an effective and popular\r\nminister; but either in word or act he had more seduction than\r\nauthority, more charm than power. Faithful to his cause and his friends,\r\nhe was unable to carry either into government or political debate that\r\nsimple, fervent, and persevering energy, that insatiable desire and\r\ndetermination to succeed, which rises before obstacles and under\r\ndefeats, and often controls wills without absolutely converting\r\nopinions. On his own account, more honest and epicurean than ambitious,\r\nhe held more to duty and pleasure than to power. Thus, although well\r\nreceived by the King and the Chambers, he neither exercised at the\r\nTuileries nor at the Palais Bourbon the authority, nor even the\r\ninfluence, which his sound mind and extraordinary talent ought to have\r\ngiven to him.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard, on the contrary, had reached and occupied the chair of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies through the importance derived from twelve years\r\nof parliamentary contest, recently confirmed by seven simultaneous\r\nelections, and by the distinguished mark of esteem which the Chamber and\r\nthe King had conferred on him. But this importance, real in moral\r\nconsideration, was politically of little weight. Since the failure of\r\nthe system of government he had supported, and his own dismissal from\r\nthe State Council by M. de Serre in 1820, M. Royer-Collard had, I will\r\nnot say fallen, but entered into a state of profound despondency. Some\r\nsentences in letters written to me from his estate at Chateau-vieux,\r\nwhere he had passed the summer, will more readily explain the condition\r\nof his mind at that time. I select the shortest:--\r\n\r\n\"_Aug. 1, 1823._--There is no trace of man here, and I am ignorant of\r\nwhat can be found in the papers; but I do not believe there is anything\r\nmore to hear. At all events, I am careless on the subject. I have no\r\nlonger any curiosity, and I well know the reason. I have lost my cause,\r\nand I much fear you will lose yours also; for you assuredly will as soon\r\nas it becomes a bad one. In these sad reflections the heart closes\r\nitself up, but without resignation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Aug. 27, 1826._--There cannot be a more perfect or innocent solitude\r\nthan that in which I have lived until this last week, which has brought\r\nM. de Talleyrand to Valencay. It is only through your letter and his\r\nconversation, that I am again connected with the world. I have never\r\nbefore so thoroughly enjoyed this kind of life,--some hours devoted to\r\nstudy, the meditations they occasion, a family walk, and the care of a\r\nsmall, domestic administration. Nevertheless, in the midst of this\r\nprofound tranquillity, on observing what passes, and what we have to\r\nexpect, the fatigue of a long life entirely wasted in wishes\r\nunaccomplished and hopes deceived, makes itself sensibly felt. I hope I\r\nshall not give way under it; in the place of illusions, there are still\r\nduties which assert their claims.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oct. 22, 1826._--After having thoroughly enjoyed this year of the\r\ncountry and of solitude, I shall return with pleasure to the society of\r\nliving minds. At this moment that society is extremely calm; but without\r\nfiring cannon, it gains ground, and insensibly establishes its power. I\r\nhave formed no idea of the coming session. I believe it to be merely\r\nthrough habit and remembrance, that any attention is yet paid to the\r\nChamber of Deputies. It belongs to another world; our time is still\r\ndistant, fortune has thrown you into the only course of life which has\r\nnow either dignity or utility. It has done well for you and for us.\"\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard was too ambitious and too speedily cast down. Human\r\naffairs do not permit so many expectations, and supply greater\r\nresources. We should expect less, and not so soon give way to despair.\r\nThe elections of 1827, the advent of the Martignac Ministry, and his\r\nown situation in the chair of the Chamber of Deputies, drew\r\nM. Royer-Collard a little from his despondency, but without much\r\nrestoring his confidence. Satisfied with his personal position, he\r\nsupported and seconded the Cabinet in the Chamber, but without warmly\r\nadopting its policy; preserving carefully the attitude of a gracious\r\nally who wishes to avoid responsibility. In his intercourse with the\r\nKing he held the same reserve, speaking the truth, and offering sage\r\nadvice, but without in the slightest degree conveying the idea that he\r\nwas ready to put in practice the energetic and consistent policy he\r\nrecommended. Charles X. listened to him with courtesy and surprise,\r\nconfiding in his loyalty, but scarcely understanding his words, and\r\nregarding him as an honest man tainted with inapplicable or even\r\ndangerous ideas. Sincerely devoted to the King, and friendly to the\r\nCabinet, M. Royer-Collard served them advantageously in their daily\r\naffairs and perils, but held himself always apart from their destiny as\r\nfrom their acts, and without bringing to them, through his co-operation,\r\nthe strength which ought to have attached to the superiority of his mind\r\nand the influence of his name.\r\n\r\nI did not at that time return to public office. The Cabinet made no such\r\nproposition to me, and I refrained from suggesting it; on either side we\r\nwere right. M. de Martignac came from the ranks of M. de Villele's\r\nparty, and was obliged to keep measures with them; it would not have\r\nbeen consistent in him to hold intimate relations with their\r\nadversaries. For my own part, even though I should consider it\r\nnecessary, I am badly adapted to serve a floating system of policy,\r\nwhich resorts to uncertain measures and expedients instead of acting on\r\nfixed and declared ideas. At a distance, I was both able and willing to\r\nsupport the new Ministry. In a close position I should have compromised\r\nthem. I had, however, my share in the triumph. Without calling me back\r\nto exercise the functions of State-Councillor, the title was restored to\r\nme; and the Minister of Public Instruction, M. de Vatimesnil, authorized\r\nthe reopening of my course.\r\n\r\nI retain a deep impression of the Sorbonne which I then entered, and of\r\nthe lectures I delivered there during two years. This was an important\r\nepoch in my life, and perhaps I may be permitted to add, a moment of\r\ninfluence on my country. With more care even than in 1821, I kept my\r\nlectures free of politics. Not only did I abstain from opposition to the\r\nMartignac Ministry, but I scrupulously avoided embarrassing them in the\r\nslightest degree. In other respects, I proposed an object to myself\r\nsufficiently important, as I thought, to occupy my entire attention. I\r\nwas anxious to study and describe, in their parallel development and\r\nreciprocal action, the various elements of our French society, the Roman\r\nworld, the Barbarians, the Christian Church, the Feudal System, the\r\nPapacy, Chivalry, Monarchy, the Commonalty, the Third Estate, and\r\nReform. I desired not only to satisfy the scientific or philosophic\r\ncuriosity of the public, but to accomplish a double end, real and\r\npractical. I proposed to demonstrate that the efforts of our time to\r\nestablish a system of equal and legal justice in society, and also of\r\npolitical guarantees and liberties in the State, were neither new nor\r\nextraordinary,--that in the course of her history, more or less\r\nobscurely or unfortunately, France had at several intervals embraced\r\nthis design, and that the generation of 1789, grasping it with\r\nenthusiasm, had committed both good and evil,--good, in resuming the\r\nglorious attempt of their ancestors,--evil in attributing to themselves\r\nthe invention and the honour, and in believing that they were called\r\nupon to create, through their own ideas and wishes, a world entirely\r\nnew. Thus, while promoting the interests of existing society, I was\r\ndesirous of bringing back amongst us a sentiment of justice and sympathy\r\nfor our early recollections and ancient customs; for that old French\r\nsocial system which had lived actively and gloriously for fifteen\r\ncenturies, to accumulate the inheritance of civilization which we have\r\ngathered. It is a lamentable mistake, and a great indication of\r\nweakness, in a nation, to forget and despise the past. It may in a\r\nrevolutionary crisis rise up against old and defective institutions; but\r\nwhen this work of destruction is accomplished, if it still continues to\r\ntreat its history with contempt, if it persuades itself that it has\r\ncompletely broken with the secular elements of its civilization, it is\r\nnot a new state of society which it can then form, it is the disorder of\r\nrevolution that it perpetuates. When the generation who possess their\r\ncountry for a moment, indulge in the absurd arrogance of believing that\r\nit belongs to them, and them alone; and that the past, in face of the\r\npresent, is death opposed to life; when they reject thus the sovereignty\r\nof tradition and the ties which mutually connect successive races, they\r\ndeny the distinction and pre-eminent characteristic of human nature, its\r\nhonour and elevated destiny; and the people who resign themselves to\r\nthis flagrant error, also fall speedily into anarchy and decline; for\r\nGod does not permit that nature and the laws of His works should be\r\nforgotten and outraged to such an extent with impunity.\r\n\r\nDuring my course of lectures from 1828 to 1830, it was my prevailing\r\nidea to contend against this injurious tendency of the public mind, to\r\nbring it back to an intelligent and impartial appreciation of our old\r\nsocial system, to inspire an affectionate respect for the early history\r\nof France; and thus to contribute, as far as I could, to establish\r\nbetween the different elements of our ancient and modern society,\r\nwhether monarchical, aristocratic, or popular, that mutual esteem and\r\nharmony which an attack of revolutionary fever may suspend, but which\r\nsoon becomes once more indispensable to the liberty as well as to the\r\nprosperity of the citizens, to the strength and tranquillity of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nI had some reason to think that I succeeded to a great extent in my\r\ndesign. My audience, numerous and diversified, youths and experienced\r\nmen, natives and foreigners, appeared to take a lively interest in the\r\nideas I expounded. These notions assimilated with the general\r\nimpressions of their minds, without demanding complete subservience, so\r\nas to combine the charms of sympathy and novelty. My listeners found\r\nthemselves, not thrown back into retrograding systems, but urged forward\r\nin the path of just and liberal reflection. By the side of my historical\r\nlessons, but without concert, and in spite of wide differences of\r\nopinion between us, literary and philosophic instruction received from\r\nmy two friends, MM. Villemain and Cousin, a corresponding character and\r\nimpulse. Opposite breezes produced the same movement; we bestowed no\r\nthought on the events and questions of the day, and we felt no desire to\r\nbring them to the attention of the public by whom we were surrounded. We\r\nwere openly and freely devoted to great general interests, great\r\nrecollections, and great hopes for man and human associations; caring\r\nonly to propagate our ideas, not indifferent as to their possible\r\nresults, but not impatient to attain them; gratified by the intellectual\r\nadvance in the midst of which we lived, and confident in the ultimate\r\nascendency of the truth which we flattered ourselves we should possess\r\nand in the liberty we hoped to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly have been profitable for us, and as I also believe\r\nfor the country, if this intention could have been prolonged, and if our\r\nminds could have fortified themselves in their calm meditations before\r\nbeing once more engaged in the passions and trials of active life. But,\r\nas it happens almost invariably, the errors of men stepped in to\r\ninterrupt the progress of ideas by precipitating the course of events.\r\nThe Martignac Ministry adopted a moderate and constitutional policy. Two\r\nbills, honestly intended and ably discussed, had given effectual\r\nguarantees, the one, to the independence of elections, and the other, to\r\nthe liberty of the press. A third, introduced at the opening of the\r\nsession of 1829, secured to the elective principle a share in the\r\nadministration of the departments and townships, and imposed on the\r\ncentral Government new rules and limitations for local affairs. These\r\nconcessions might be considered too extensive or too narrow; but in\r\neither case they were real, and the advocates of public liberty could do\r\nnothing better than accept and establish them. But in the Liberal party\r\nwho had hitherto supported the Cabinet, two feelings, little politic in\r\ntheir character, the spirit of impatience and the love of system, the\r\ndesire for popularity and the severity of reason, were indisposed to be\r\nsatisfied with those slow and imperfect conquests. The right-hand party,\r\nby refusing to vote, left the Ministry in contest with the wants of\r\ntheir allies. Despite the efforts of M. de Martignac, an amendment, more\r\nformidable in appearance than in reality, attacked in some measure the\r\nplan of the bill upon departmental administration. With the King, and\r\nalso with the Chambers, the Ministry had reached the term of its credit;\r\nunable to obtain from the King what would give confidence to the\r\nChambers, or from the Chambers what would satisfy the King, it\r\nvoluntarily declared its impotence by hastily withdrawing the two bills,\r\nand still remained standing, although struck by a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nHow could it be replaced? The question remained in suspense for three\r\nmonths. Three men alone, M. Royer-Collard, M. de Villele, and\r\nM. de Chateaubriand seemed capable of forming a new Cabinet that might\r\nlast, although compounded of very different shades. The two first were\r\nentirely out of the question. Neither the King nor the Chambers\r\ncontemplated the idea of making a Prime Minister of M. Royer-Collard. He\r\nperhaps had thought of it himself, more than once, for nothing was too\r\nbold to cross his mind in his solitary reveries; but these were merely\r\ninward lucubrations, not actually ambitious designs; if power had been\r\noffered to him he would assuredly have refused it; he had too little\r\nconfidence in the future, and too much personal pride, to encounter\r\nsuch a risk of failure.\r\n\r\nM. de Villele, still suffering from the accusations first whispered\r\nagainst him in 1828, and which had remained in abeyance in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies, had formally refused to attend the session of 1829, and\r\nheld himself in retirement at his estate near Toulouse; it was evident\r\nthat he could not return to power, and act with the Chamber that had\r\nthrown him out. Neither the King nor himself would have consented, as I\r\nthink, to encounter at that time the hazard of a new dissolution.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was at Rome. On the formation of the Cabinet of\r\nM. de Martignac he had accepted that embassy, and from thence, with a\r\nmixture of ambition and contempt he watched the uncertain policy and\r\nwavering position of the Ministers at Paris. When he learned that they\r\nwere beaten, and would in all probability be compelled to retire, he\r\nimmediately commenced an active agitation. \"You estimate correctly my\r\nsurprise,\" he wrote to Madame Recamier, \"at the news of the _withdrawal_\r\nof the two bills. Wounded self-love makes men children, and gives them\r\nvery bad advice. What will be the end of all this? Will the Ministers\r\nendeavour to hold place? Will they retire partially or all together? Who\r\nwill succeed them? How is a Cabinet to be composed? I assure you that,\r\nwere it not for the pain of losing your society, I should rejoice at\r\nbeing here, out of the way, and at not being mixed up in all these\r\nenmities and follies, for I find that all are equally in the wrong....\r\nAttend well to this; here is something more explicit: if by chance the\r\nportfolio of Foreign Affairs should be offered to me (and I have no\r\nreason to expect it), I should not refuse. I should come to Paris, I\r\nshould speak to the King, I should arrange a Ministry without being\r\nincluded in it; for myself, I should propose, to attach me to my own\r\nwork, a suitable position. I think, as you know, that it belongs to my\r\nministerial reputation, as well as to revenge me for the injury I\r\nsustained from Villele, that the portfolio of Foreign Affairs should be\r\ngiven to me for the moment. This is the only honourable mode in which I\r\ncould rejoin the Administration. But that done, I should immediately\r\nretire, to the great satisfaction of all new aspirants, and pass the\r\nremainder of my life near you in perfect repose.\"[19]\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was not called to enjoy this haughty vengeance, or\r\nto exhibit such a demonstration of generosity. While he still dreamed of\r\nit in the Pyrenees, whither he had repaired to rest from the labours of\r\nthe Conclave which gave Pius VIII. as successor to Leo X., the\r\nPrince de Polignac, brought over from London by the King, arrived in\r\nParis on the 27th of July; and on the 9th of August, eight days after\r\nthe closing of the session, his Cabinet was officially announced in the\r\n'Moniteur.' What course would he propose to himself? What measures would\r\nhe adopt? No one could tell; not even M. de Polignac and the King\r\nthemselves any more than the public. But Charles X. had hoisted upon the\r\nTuileries the flag of the Counter-Revolution.\r\n\r\nPolitics soon became the absorbing consideration of every mind. From all\r\nquarters a fierce struggle was foreseen in the approaching session; all\r\nparties hastened to congregate beforehand round the scene of action,\r\nseeking to draw some anticipation as to what would occur, and how to\r\nsecure a place. On the 19th of October, 1829, the death of the learned\r\nchemist, M. Vauquelin, left open a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, in\r\nwhich he had represented the division of Lisieux and Pont-l'Eveque,\r\nwhich formed the fourth electoral district in the department of\r\nCalvados. Several influential persons of the country proposed to\r\nsubstitute me in his place. I had never inhabited or even visited that\r\nprovince. I had no property there of any kind. But since 1820, my\r\npolitical writings and lectures had given popularity to my name. The\r\nyoung portions of the community were everywhere favourably disposed\r\ntowards me. The Moderates and active Liberals mutually looked to me to\r\ndefend them, and their cause, should occasion arrive. As soon as the\r\nproposition became known at Lisieux and Pont-l'Eveque, it was cordially\r\nreceived. All the different shades of the Opposition, M. de La Fayette\r\nand M. de Chateaubriand, M. Dupont de l'Eure and the Duke de Broglie,\r\nM. Odillon Barrot and M. Bertin de Veaux, seconded my candidateship.\r\nAbsent, but supported by a strong display of opinion in the district, I\r\nwas elected on the 23rd of February, 1830, by a large majority.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment M. Berryer, whose age, as in my own case, had until\r\nthen excluded him from the Chamber of Deputies, was elected by the\r\ndepartment of the Higher Loire, where a seat had also become vacant.\r\n\r\nOn the day following that on which my election was known in Paris, I\r\nhad to deliver my lecture at the Sorbonne. As I entered the hall, the\r\nentire audience rose and received me with a burst of applause. I\r\nimmediately checked them, and said: \"I thank you for your kind\r\nreception, by which I am sensibly affected. I request two favours of\r\nyou; the first is to preserve always the same feelings towards me; the\r\nsecond is, never to evince them again in this manner. Nothing that\r\npasses without should resound within these walls.

To be excited under the semblance of immobility,\r\nto do nothing while we expect much, to look on the calm while we\r\nanticipate the tempest,--this, perhaps, of all human situations, is the\r\nmost oppressive for the mind to endure, and the most difficult to\r\nsustain for any length of time.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the year 1830, such was the common position of\r\nall,--of the Government and the nation, of the ministers and citizens,\r\nof the supporters and opponents of power. No one acted directly, and all\r\nprepared themselves for unknown chances. We pursued our ordinary course\r\nof life, while we felt ourselves on the brink of a convulsion.\r\n\r\nI proceeded quietly with my course at the Sorbonne. There, where\r\nM. de Villele and the Abbe Frayssinous had silenced me, M. de Polignac\r\nand M. de Guernon-Ranville permitted me to speak freely. While enjoying\r\nthis liberty, I scrupulously preserved my habitual caution, keeping\r\nevery lecture entirely divested of all allusion to incidental questions,\r\nand not more solicitous of winning popular favour, than apprehensive of\r\nlosing ministerial patronage. Until the meeting of the Chamber, my new\r\ntitle of Deputy called for no step or demonstration, and I sought not\r\nfor any factitious opportunity. In some paragraphs of town and court\r\ngossip, several of the papers in the interest of the extreme right\r\nasserted that meetings of Deputies had been held at the residence of the\r\nlate President of the Chamber. M. Royer-Collard, upon this, wrote\r\nimmediately to the 'Moniteur:'--\"It is positively false that any meeting\r\nof Deputies has taken place at my residence since the closing of the\r\nsession of 1829. This is all I have to say; I should feel ashamed of\r\nformally denying absurd reports, in which the King is not more respected\r\nthan the truth.\" Without feeling myself restricted to the severe\r\nabstinence of M. Royer-Collard, I sedulously avoided all demonstrative\r\nopposition; my friends and I were mutually intent on furnishing no\r\npretext for the mistakes of power.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of this tranquil and reserved life, I was deeply\r\noccupied in reflecting on my new position, and on the part I was\r\nhenceforward to assume in the uncertain fortune of my country. I\r\nrevolved over in my mind every opposite chance, looking upon all as\r\npossible, and wishing to be prepared for all, even for those I was most\r\ndesirous to avert. Power cannot commit a greater error than that of\r\nplunging imaginations into darkness. A great public terror is worse than\r\na great positive evil; above all, when obscure perspectives of the\r\nfuture excite the hopes of enemies and blunderers, as well as the alarms\r\nof honest men and friends. I lived in the midst of both classes.\r\nAlthough no longer interested in the electoral object which had\r\noccasioned its institution in 1827, the society called, \"Help thyself\r\nand Heaven will help thee\" existed still, and I still continued to be a\r\nmember. Under the Martignac Ministry I considered it advisable to remain\r\namongst them, that I might endeavour to moderate a little the wants and\r\nimpatience of the external opposition, which operated so powerfully on\r\nthe opposition in Parliament. Since the formation of the Polignac\r\nCabinet, from which everything was to be apprehended, I endeavoured to\r\nmaintain a certain degree of interest in this assembly of all opposing\r\nparties, Constitutionalists, Republicans, and Buonapartists, which, in\r\nthe moment of a crisis, might exercise itself such preponderating\r\ninfluence on the destiny of the country. At the moment, I possessed\r\nconsiderable popularity, especially with the younger men, and the ardent\r\nbut sincere Liberals. I felt gratified at this, and resolved to turn it\r\nto profitable use, let the future produce what it might.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the public resembled my own, tranquil on the surface but\r\nextremely agitated at the heart. There was neither conspiracy, nor\r\nrising, nor tumultuous assembly; but all were on the alert, and prepared\r\nfor anything that might happen. In Brittany, in Normandy, in Burgundy,\r\nin Lorraine, and in Paris, associations were publicly formed to resist\r\npayment of the taxes, if the Government should attempt to collect them\r\nwithout a legal vote of the legal Chambers. The Government prosecuted\r\nthe papers which had advertised these meetings; some tribunals acquitted\r\nthe responsible managers, others, and amongst them the Royal Court of\r\nParis, condemned them, but to a very slight punishment, \"for exciting\r\nhatred and contempt against the King's government, in having imputed to\r\nthem the criminal intention either of levying taxes which had not been\r\nvoted by the two Chambers, or of changing illegally the mode of\r\nelection, or even of revoking the constitutional Charter which has been\r\ngranted and confirmed in perpetuity, and which regulates the rights and\r\nduties of every public authority.\" The ministerial journals felt their\r\nposition, and saw that their patrons were so reached by this sentence,\r\nthat, in publishing it, they suppressed all observations.\r\n\r\nIn presence of this opposition, at once so decided and restrained, the\r\nMinistry remained timid and inactive. Evidently doubtful of themselves,\r\nthey feared the opinion in which they were held by others. A year before\r\nthis time, at the opening of the session of 1829, when the Cabinet of\r\nM. de Martignac still held power, and the department of Foreign Affairs\r\nhad fallen vacant by the retirement of M. de la Ferronnays,\r\nM. de Polignac had endeavoured, in the debate on the address in the\r\nChamber of Peers, to dissipate, by a profession of constitutional faith,\r\nthe prejudices entertained against him. His assurances of attachment to\r\nthe Charter were not, on his part, a simply ambitious and hypocritical\r\ncalculation; he really fancied himself a friend to constitutional\r\ngovernment, and was not then meditating its overthrow; but in the\r\nmediocrity of his mind, and the confusion of his ideas, he neither\r\nunderstood thoroughly the English society he wished to imitate, nor the\r\nFrench system he desired to reform. He believed the Charter to be\r\ncompatible with the political importance of the old nobility, and with\r\nthe definitive supremacy of the ancient Royalty; and he flattered\r\nhimself that he could develop new institutions by making them assist in\r\nthe preponderance of influences which it was his distinct object to\r\nlimit or abolish. It is difficult to measure the extent of conscientious\r\nillusions in a mind weak but enthusiastic, ordinary, but with some\r\ndegree of elevation, and mystically vague and subtle. M. de Polignac\r\nfelt honestly surprised at not being acknowledged as a minister devoted\r\nto constitutional rule; but the public, without troubling themselves to\r\ninquire into his sincerity, had determined to regard him as the champion\r\nof the old system, and the standard-bearer of the counter-revolution.\r\nDisturbed by this reputation, and fearing to confirm it by his acts,\r\nM. de Polignac did nothing. His Cabinet, sworn to conquer the Revolution\r\nand to save the Monarchy, remained motionless and sterile. The\r\nOpposition insultingly taxed them with their impotence: they were\r\nchristened \"the Braggadocio Ministry,\" \"the most helpless of Cabinets;\"\r\nand to all this they gave no answer, except by preparing the expedition\r\nto Algiers, and by convoking the assembly of the Chambers, ever\r\nprotesting their fidelity to the Charter, and promising themselves, as\r\nmeans of escape from their embarrassments, a conquest and a majority.\r\n\r\nM. de Polignac was ignorant that a minister does not entirely govern by\r\nhis own acts, and that he is responsible for others besides himself.\r\nWhile he endeavoured to escape from the character assigned to him, by\r\nsilence and inaction,--his friends, his functionaries, his writers, his\r\nentire party, masters and servants, spoke and moved noisily around him.\r\nHe expressed his anger when they discussed, as an hypothesis, the\r\ncollection of taxes not voted by the Chambers; and at that same moment\r\nthe Attorney-General of the Royal Court at Metz, M. Pinaud, said, in a\r\nrequisition, \"Article 14 of the Charter secures to the King a method of\r\nresisting electoral or elective majorities. If then, renewing the days\r\nof 1792 and 1793, the majority should refuse the taxes, would the King\r\nbe called upon to deliver up his crown to the spectre of the Convention?\r\nNo; but in that case he ought to maintain his right, and save himself\r\nfrom the danger by means respecting which it is proper to keep silence.\"\r\nOn the 1st of January, the Royal Court of Paris, who had just given a\r\nproof of their firm adherence to the Charter, presented themselves,\r\naccording to custom, at the Tuileries; the King received and spoke to\r\nthem with marked dryness; and when arriving in front of the Dauphiness,\r\nthe first President prepared to address his homage to her, \"Pass on,\r\npass on,\" exclaimed she brusquely; and while complying with her words,\r\nM. Seguier said to the Master of the Ceremonies, M. de Rochemore, \"My\r\nLord Marquis, do you think that the Court ought to inscribe the answer\r\nof the Princess in its records?\" A magistrate high in favour with the\r\nMinister, M. Cotta, an honest but a light and credulous individual,\r\npublished a work entitled, 'On the Necessity of a Dictatorship.' A\r\npublicist, a fanatical but sincere reasoner, M. Madrolle, dedicated to\r\nM. de Polignac a memorial, in which he maintained the necessity of\r\nremodelling the law of elections by a royal decree. \"What are called\r\n_coups d'etat_,\" said some important journals, and avowed friends of the\r\nCabinet, \"are social and regular in their nature when the King acts for\r\nthe general good of the people, even though in appearance he may\r\ncontravene the existing laws.\" In fact France was tranquil, and legal\r\norder in full vigour; neither on the part of authority nor on that of\r\nthe people had any act of violence called for violence in return; and\r\nyet the most extreme measures were openly discussed. In all quarters\r\npeople proclaimed the imminence of revolution, the dictatorship of the\r\nKing, and the legitimacy of _coups d'etat_.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of urgent danger, a nation may accept an isolated _coup\r\nd'etat_ as a necessity; but it cannot, without dishonour and decline,\r\nadmit the principle of such measures as the permanent basis of its\r\npublic rights and government. Now this was precisely what M. de Polignac\r\nand his friends pretended to impose on France. According to them, the\r\nabsolute power of the old Royalty remained always at the bottom of the\r\nCharter; and to expand and display this absolute power, they selected a\r\nmoment when no active plot, no visible danger, no great public\r\ndisturbance, threatened either the Government of the King or the order\r\nof the State. The sole question at issue was, whether the Crown could,\r\nin the selection and maintenance of its advisers, hold itself entirely\r\nindependent of the majority in the Chambers, or the country; and\r\nwhether, in conclusion, after so many constitutional experiments, the\r\nsole governing power was to be concentrated in the Royal will. The\r\nformation of the Polignac Ministry had been, on the part of the King,\r\nCharles X., an obstinate idea even more than a cry of alarm, an\r\naggressive challenge as much as an act of suspicion. Uneasy, not only\r\nfor the security of his throne, but for what he considered the\r\nunalienable rights of his crown, he placed himself, to maintain them, in\r\nthe most offensive of all possible attitudes towards the nation. He\r\nassumed defiance rather than defence. It was no longer a struggle\r\nbetween the different parties and systems of government, but a question\r\nof political dogma, and an affair of honour between France and her King.\r\n\r\nIn presence of a subject under this aspect, passions and intentions\r\nhostile to established order could not fail to resume hope and appear\r\nonce more upon the stage. The sovereignty of the people was always at\r\nhand, available to be invoked in opposition to the sovereignty of the\r\nMonarch. Popular strokes of policy were to be perceived, ready to reply\r\nto the attempts of royal power. The party which had never seriously put\r\nfaith in or adhered to the Restoration, had now new interpreters,\r\ndestined speedily to become new leaders, and younger, as well as more\r\nrational and skilful than their predecessors. There were no\r\nconspiracies, no risings in any quarter; secret machinations and noisy\r\nriots were equally abandoned; everywhere a bolder and yet a more\r\nmoderate line of conduct was adopted, more prudent, and at the same time\r\nmore efficacious. In public discussion, appeal was made to examples from\r\nhistory and to the probabilities of the future. Without directly\r\nattacking the reigning power, lawful freedom in opposition was pushed to\r\nits extremest limits, too clearly to be taxed with hypocrisy, and too\r\ningeniously to be arrested in this hostile proceeding. In the more\r\nserious and intelligent organs of the party, such as the 'National,'\r\nthey did not absolutely propound anarchical theories, or revolutionary\r\nconstitutions; they confined themselves to the Charter from which\r\nRoyalty seemed on the point of escaping, either by carefully explaining\r\nthe import, or by peremptorily demanding the complete and sincere\r\nexecution; by making it clearly foreseen that compromising the national\r\nright would also compromise the reigning dynasty. They avowed themselves\r\ndecided and prepared, not to anticipate, but to accept without\r\nhesitation the last trial evidently approaching, and the rapid progress\r\nof which they clearly indicated to the public from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe conduct to be held by the constitutional Royalists who had laboured\r\nin honest sincerity to establish the Restoration with the Charter,\r\nalthough less dangerous, was even more complex and difficult. How could\r\nthey repulse the blow with which Royalty menaced the existing\r\ninstitutions, without inflicting on Royalty a mortal wound in return?\r\nShould they remain on the defensive, wait until the Cabinet committed\r\nacts, or introduced measures really hostile to the interests and\r\nliberties of France, and reject them when their character and object had\r\nbeen clearly developed in debate? Or should they take a bolder\r\ninitiative, and check the Cabinet in its first steps, and thus prevent\r\nthe unknown struggles which at a later period it would be impossible to\r\ndirect or restrain? This was the great practical question, which, when\r\nthe Chambers were convened, occupied, above all other considerations,\r\nthose minds which were strangers to all preconcerted hostility, and to\r\nevery secret desire of encountering new hazards.\r\n\r\nTwo figures have remained, since 1830, impressed on my memory; the King,\r\nCharles X., at the Louvre on the 2nd of March, opening the session of\r\nthe Chambers; and the Prince de Polignac at the Palais Bourbon on the\r\n15th and 16th of March, taking part in the discussion on the address of\r\nthe Two Hundred and Twenty-One Deputies. The demeanour of the King was,\r\nas usual, noble and benevolent, but mingled with restrained agitation\r\nand embarrassment. He read his speech mildly, although with some\r\nprecipitation, as if anxious to finish; and when he came to the sentence\r\nwhich, under a modified form, contained a royal menace,[20] he\r\naccentuated it with more affectation than energy. As he placed his hand\r\nupon the passage, his hat fell; the Duke d'Orleans raised and presented\r\nit to him, respectfully bending his knee. Amongst the Deputies, the\r\nacclamations of the right-hand party were more loud than joyful, and it\r\nwas difficult to decide whether the silence of the rest of the Chamber\r\nproceeded from sadness or apathy. Fifteen days later, at the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and in the midst of the secret committee in which the address\r\nwas discussed, in that vast hall, void of spectators, M. de Polignac was\r\non his bench, motionless, and little attended even by his friends, with\r\nthe air of a stranger surprised and out of place, thrown into a world\r\nwith which he is scarcely acquainted, where he feels that he is\r\nunwelcome, and charged with a difficult mission, the issue of which he\r\nawaits with inert and impotent dignity. In the course of the debate, he\r\nwas reproached with an act of the Ministry in reference to the\r\nelections, to which he replied awkwardly by a few short and confused\r\nwords, as if not thoroughly understanding the objection, and anxious to\r\nresume his seat. While I was in the tribune, my eyes encountered his,\r\nand I was struck by their expression of astonished curiosity. It was\r\nmanifest that at the moment when they ventured on an act of voluntary\r\nboldness, neither the King nor his minister felt at their ease; in the\r\ntwo individuals, in their respective aspects as in their souls, there\r\nwas a mixture of resolution and weakness, of confidence and uncertainty,\r\nwhich at the same moment testified blindness of the mind and the\r\npresentiment of coming evil.\r\n\r\nWe waited with impatience the address from the Chamber of Peers. Had it\r\nbeen energetic, it would have added strength to ours. Whatever has been\r\nsaid, their address was neither blind nor servile, but it was far from\r\nforcible. It recommended respect for institutions and national\r\nliberties, and protested equally against despotism and anarchy.\r\nDisquietude and censure were perceptible through the reserve of words;\r\nbut these impressions were dimly conveyed and stripped of all\r\npower. Their unanimity evinced nothing beyond their nullity.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand alone, while signifying his approbation, considered\r\nthem insufficient. The Court declared itself satisfied. The Chamber\r\nseemed more desirous of discharging a debt of conscience, and of\r\nescaping from all responsibility in the evils which it foresaw, than of\r\nmaking a sound effort to prevent them. \"If the Chamber of Peers had\r\nspoken out more distinctly,\" said M. Royer-Collard to me, shortly after\r\nthe Revolution, \"it might have arrested the King on the brink of the\r\nabyss, and have prevented the Decrees.\" But the Chamber of Peers had\r\nlittle confidence in their own power to charm away the danger, and\r\nfeared to aggravate it by a too open display. The entire weight of the\r\nsituation fell upon the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe perplexity was great,--great in the majority of sincere Royalists,\r\nin the Committee charged to draw up the Address, and in the mind of\r\nM. Royer-Collard who presided, both in the Committee and the Chamber,\r\nand exercised on both a preponderating influence. One general sentiment\r\nprevailed,--a desire to stay the King in the false path on which he had\r\nentered, and a conviction that there was no hope of succeeding in this\r\nobject, but by placing before him an impediment which it would be\r\nimpossible for him personally to misunderstand. It was evident, when he\r\ndismissed M. de Martignac and appointed M. de Polignac to succeed him,\r\nthat he was not alone influenced by his fears as a King. In this act\r\nCharles X. had, above all considerations, been swayed by his passions of\r\nthe old system. It became indispensable that the peril of this tendency\r\nshould be clearly demonstrated to him, and that where prudence had not\r\nsufficed, impossibility should make itself felt. By expressing, without\r\ndelay or circumlocution, its want of confidence in the Cabinet, the\r\nChamber in no way exceeded its privilege; it expressed its own judgment,\r\nwithout denying to the King the free exercise of his, and his right of\r\nappealing to the country by a dissolution. The Chamber acted\r\ndeliberately and honestly; it renounced empty or ambiguous words, to\r\nassert the frank and strong measures of the constitutional system. There\r\nwas no other method of remaining in harmony with the public feeling so\r\nstrongly excited, and of restraining it by legitimate concessions. There\r\nwas reason to hope that language at once firm and loyal would prove as\r\nefficacious as it was necessary; already, under similar circumstances,\r\nthe King had not shown himself intractable, for two years before, in\r\nJanuary, 1828, he had dismissed M. de Villele, almost without a\r\nstruggle, after the elections had produced a majority decidedly opposed\r\nto his Cabinet.\r\n\r\nDuring five days, the Committee, in their sittings, and M. Royer-Collard\r\nin his private reflections, as well as in his confidential intercourse\r\nwith his friends, scrupulously weighed all these considerations, as well\r\nas all the phrases and words of the Address. M. Royer-Collard was not\r\nonly a staunch Royalist, but his mind was disposed to doubt and\r\nhesitation; he became bewildered in his resolves as he looked on the\r\ndifferent aspects of a question, and always shrank from important\r\nresponsibility. For two years he had observed Charles X. closely, and\r\nmore than once during the Martignac Administration he had said to some\r\nof the more rational oppositionists, \"Do not press the King too closely;\r\nno one can tell to what follies he might have recourse.\" But at the\r\npoint which matters had now reached, called upon as he was to represent\r\nthe sentiments and maintain the honour of the Chamber, M. Royer-Collard\r\nfelt that he could not refuse to carry the truth to the foot of the\r\nthrone; and he flattered himself that on appearing there, with a\r\nrespectful and affectionate demeanour, he would be in 1830, as in 1828,\r\nif not well received, at least listened to without any fatal explosion.\r\n\r\nThe Address in fact bore this double character: never had language more\r\nunpresuming in its boldness, and more conciliating in its freedom, been\r\nheld to a monarch in the name of his people.[21] When the President read\r\nit to the Chamber for the first time, a secret satisfaction faction of\r\ndignity mingled in the most moderate hearts with the uneasiness they\r\nexperienced. The debate was short and extremely reserved, almost even to\r\ncoldness. On all sides, the members feared to commit themselves by\r\nspeaking; and there was an evident desire to come to a conclusion. Four\r\nof the Ministers, MM. de Montbel, de Guernon-Ranville, de Chantelauze,\r\nand d'Haussez took part in the discussion, but almost exclusively on the\r\ngeneral question. In the Chamber of Deputies, as in the Chamber of\r\nPeers, the leader of the Cabinet remained mute. It is on more lofty\r\nconditions that political aristocracies maintain or raise themselves.\r\nWhen they came to the last paragraphs, which contained the decisive\r\nphrases, the individual members of the different parties maintained the\r\ncontest alone. It was then that M. Berryer and I ascended the tribune\r\nfor the first time, both new to the Chamber, he as a friend and I as an\r\nopponent of the Ministry; he to attack and I to defend the Address. It\r\ngives me pleasure, I confess, to retrace and repeat today, the ideas and\r\narguments by which I supported it at the time. \"Under what auspices,\" I\r\nasked the Chamber, \"and in the name of what principles and interests has\r\nthe present Ministry been formed? In the name of power menaced, of the\r\nRoyal prerogative compromised, of the interests of the Crown ill\r\nunderstood and sustained by their predecessors. This is the banner under\r\nwhich they have entered the lists, the cause they have promised to make\r\ntriumphant. We had a right to expect from their entrance on office that\r\nauthority should be exercised with vigour, the Royal prerogative in\r\nactive operation, the principles of power not only proclaimed but\r\npractised, perhaps at the expense of the public liberty, but at least\r\nfor the advantage of that power itself. Gentlemen, has this happened?\r\nHas power strengthened itself within the last seven months? Has it been\r\nexercised with activity, energy, confidence, and efficacy? Either I\r\ngrossly deceive myself, or during these seven months power has suffered\r\nin confidence and energy, to the full extent of what the public have\r\nlost in security.\"\r\n\r\n\"But power has lost more than this. It is not entirely comprised in the\r\npositive acts it commits or the materials it employs; it does not always\r\nend in decrees and circulars. The authority over minds, the moral\r\nascendency, that ascendency so suitable to free countries, for it\r\ndirects without controlling public will,--in this is comprised an\r\nimportant component of power, perhaps the first of all in efficiency.\r\nBut beyond all question, it is the re-establishment of this moral\r\nascendency which is at this moment the most essential need of our\r\ncountry. We have known power extremely active and strong, capable of\r\ngreat and difficult undertakings; but whether from the inherent vice of\r\nits nature, or by the evil of its position, moral ascendency, that easy,\r\nregular, and imperceptible empire, has been almost entirely wanting. The\r\nKing's government, more than any other, is called upon to possess this.\r\nIt does not extract its right from force. We have not witnessed its\r\nbirth; we have not contracted towards it those familiar associations,\r\nsome of which always remain attached to the authorities at the infancy\r\nof which those who obey them were present. What has the actual Ministry\r\ndone with that moral ascendency which belongs naturally, without\r\npremeditation or labour, to the King's government? Has it exercised it\r\nskilfully, and increased it in the exercise? Has it not, on the\r\ncontrary, seriously compromised this great element, by placing it at\r\nissue with the fears to which it has given rise, and the passions it has\r\nexcited?...\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, your entire mission is not to control, or at the least to\r\noppose power; you are not here solely to retrieve its errors or injuries\r\nand to make them known to the country; you are also sent here to\r\nsurround the government of the King--to enlighten it while you surround,\r\nand to support it while you enlighten.... Well, then, what is at this\r\nmoment the position in the Chamber of the members who are the most\r\ndisposed to undertake the character of those who are the greatest\r\nstrangers to the spirit of faction, and unaccustomed to the habits of\r\nopposition? They are compelled to become oppositionists; they are made\r\nso in spite of themselves; they desire to remain always united to the\r\nKing's government, and now they are forced to separate from it; they\r\nwish to support, and are driven to attack. They have been propelled from\r\ntheir proper path. The perplexity which disturbs them has been created\r\nby the Ministry in office; it will continue and redouble as long as they\r\ncontinue where they are.\"\r\n\r\nI pointed out the analogous perturbation which existed everywhere, in\r\nsociety as in the Chambers; I showed how the public authorities, in\r\ncommon with the good citizens, were thrown out of their natural duties\r\nand position; the tribunals, more intent on restraining the Government\r\nitself than in repressing disorders and plans directed against it; the\r\npapers, exercising with the tolerance, and even with the approbation of\r\nthe public, an unlimited and disorderly influence. I concluded by\r\nsaying: \"They tell us that France is tranquil, that order is not\r\ndisturbed. It is true; material order is not disturbed; everything\r\ncirculates freely and peaceably; no commotion deranges the current of\r\naffairs.... The surface of society is calm,--so calm that the Government\r\nmay well be tempted to believe that the interior is perfectly secure,\r\nand to consider itself sheltered from all peril. Our words, gentlemen,\r\nthe frankness of our words, comprises the sole warning that power can at\r\nthis moment receive, the only voice that can reach it and dissipate its\r\nillusions. Let us take care not to diminish their force or to enervate\r\nour expressions; let them be respectful and even gentle, but let them at\r\nthe same time be neither timid nor ambiguous. Truth already finds it\r\ndifficult enough to penetrate into the palaces of kings; let us not send\r\nher there weak and trembling; let it be as impossible to misunderstand\r\nwhat we say, as to mistake the loyalty of our sentiments.\"\r\n\r\nThe Address passed as it was drawn up, with uneasy sadness, but with a\r\nprofound conviction of its necessity. Two days after the vote, on the\r\n18th of March, we repaired to the Tuileries to present it to the King.\r\nTwenty-one members alone joined the official deputation of the Chamber.\r\nAmongst those who had voted for the Address, some were little anxious of\r\nsupporting by their presence, under the eyes of the King, such an act\r\nof opposition; others, from respect for the Crown, had no wish to give\r\nto this presentation additional solemnity and effect. Our entire\r\nnumber amounted only to forty-six. We waited some time in the\r\n\"Salon de la Paix,\" until the King returned from Mass. We stood there in\r\nsilence; opposite to us, in the recesses of the windows, were the King's\r\npages and some members of the royal establishment, inattentive and\r\nalmost intentionally rude. The Dauphiness crossed the saloon on her way\r\nto the chapel, rapidly and without noticing us. She might have been much\r\ncolder still before I could have felt that I had any right either to be\r\nsurprised or indignant at her demeanour. There are crimes whose\r\nremembrance silences all other thoughts, and misfortunes before which we\r\nbow with a respect almost resembling repentance, as if we ourselves had\r\nbeen the author of them.\r\n\r\nWhen we were introduced into the hall of the throne, M. Royer-Collard\r\nread the address naturally and suitably, with an emotion which his voice\r\nand features betrayed. The King listened to him with becoming dignity\r\nand without any air of haughtiness or ill humour; his answer was brief\r\nand dry, rather from royal habit than from anger, and, if I am not\r\nmistaken, he felt more satisfied with his own firmness than uneasy for\r\nthe future. Four days before, on the eve of the debate on the address,\r\nin his circle at the Tuileries, to which many Deputies were invited, I\r\nsaw him bestow marked intention on three members of the Commission,\r\nMM. Dupin, Etienne, and Gautier. In two such opposite situations, it was\r\nthe same man and almost the same physiognomy, identical in his manners\r\nas in his ideas, careful to please although determined to quarrel, and\r\nobstinate from want of foresight and mental routine, rather than from\r\nthe passion of pride or power.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the presentation of the address, the 19th of March, the\r\nsession was prorogued to the 1st of September. Two months later, on the\r\n16th of May, the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved; the two most\r\nmoderate members of the Cabinet, the Chancellor and the Minister of\r\nFinance, M. Courvoisier and M. de Chabrol, left the Council; they had\r\nrefused their concurrence to the extreme measures already debated there,\r\nin case the elections should falsify the expectations of power. The most\r\ncompromised and audacious member of the Villele Cabinet,\r\nM. de Peyronnet, became Minister of the Interior. By the dissolution,\r\nthe King appealed to the country, and at the same moment he took fresh\r\nsteps to separate himself from his people.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to the private life from which he never again emerged,\r\nM. Courvoisier wrote to me on the 29th of September 1831, from his\r\nretirement at Baume-les-Dames: \"Before resigning the Seals, I happened\r\nto be in conversation with M. Pozzo di Borgo on the state of the\r\ncountry, and the perils with which the throne had surrounded itself.\r\nWhat means, said he to me, are there of opening the King's eyes, and of\r\ndrawing him from a system which may once again overturn Europe and\r\nFrance?--I see but one, replied I, and that is a letter from the hand of\r\nthe Emperor of Russia.--He shall write it, said he; he shall write it\r\nfrom Warsaw, whither he is about to repair.--We then conversed together\r\non the substance of the letter. M. Pozzo di Borgo often said to me that\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas saw no security for the Bourbons, but in the\r\nfulfilment of the Charter.\"\r\n\r\nI much doubt whether the Emperor Nicholas ever wrote himself to the\r\nKing, Charles X.; but what his ambassador at Paris had said to the\r\nChancellor of France, he himself repeated to the Duke de Mortemart, the\r\nKing's ambassador at St. Petersburg:--\"If they deviate from the Charter,\r\nthey will lead direct to a catastrophe; if the King attempts a\r\n_coup-d'etat_, the responsibility will fall on himself alone.\" The\r\ncouncils of monarchs were not more wanting to Charles X., than the\r\naddresses of nations, to detach him from his fatal design.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the electoral glove was thrown down, my friends wrote to me\r\nfrom Nismes that my presence was necessary to unite them all, and to\r\nhold out in the College of the department any prospect of success. It\r\nwas also desired that I should go, of my own accord, to Lisieux; but\r\nthey added that if I was required elsewhere, they thought, even in my\r\nabsence, they could guarantee my election. I trusted to this assurance,\r\nand set out for Nismes on the 15th June, anxious to sound myself, and on\r\nthe spot, the real dispositions of the country; which we so soon forget\r\nwhen confined to Paris.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to substitute for my impressions of that epoch my ideas\r\nof the present day, or to attribute to my own political conduct and to\r\nthat of my friends an interpretation which neither could assume. I\r\nrepublish, without alteration, what I find in the confidential letters I\r\nwrote or received during my journey. These supply the most\r\nunobjectionable evidences of what we thought and wished at the time.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June, some days after my arrival at Nismes, I wrote as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"The contest is very sharp, more so than you can understand at a\r\ndistance. The two parties are seriously engaged, and hourly oppose each\r\nother with increasing animosity. An absolute fever of egotism and\r\nstupidity possesses and instigates the administration. The opposition\r\nstruggles, with passionate ardour, against the embarrassments and\r\nannoyances of a situation, both in a legal and moral sense, of extreme\r\ndifficulty. It finds in the laws means of action and defence, which\r\nimpart the courage necessary to sustain the combat, but without\r\ninspiring the confidence of success; for almost everywhere, the last\r\nguarantee is wanting, and after having fought long and bravely, we\r\nalways run the risk of finding ourselves suddenly disarmed, and\r\nhelpless. A similar anxiety applies to the moral position: the\r\nopposition despises the ministry, and at the same time looks upon it as\r\nits superior; the functionaries are in disrepute, but still they take\r\nprecedence; a remembrance of imperial greatness and power yet furnishes\r\nthem with a pedestal; they are looked on disdainfully, with a mingled\r\nsensation of fear and anger. In this state of affairs there are many\r\nelements of agitation, and even of a crisis. Nevertheless, no sooner\r\ndoes an explosion appear imminent, or even possible, than every one\r\nshrinks from it in apprehension. In conclusion, all parties at present\r\nlook for their security in order and peace. There is no confidence\r\nexcept in legitimate measures.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of July, I received the following from Paris:--\r\n\r\n\"The elections of the great colleges have commenced. If we gain any\r\nadvantage there, it will be excellent; above all, for the effect it may\r\nproduce on the King's mind, who can expect nothing more favourable to\r\nhim than the great colleges. At present, there are no indications of a\r\n_coup d'etat_. The 'Quotidienne' announces this morning that it looks\r\nupon the session as opened, admitting at the same time that the Ministry\r\nwill not have a majority. It appears delighted at there being no\r\nprospect of an address exactly similar to that of the Two Hundred and\r\nTwenty-one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, on the 12th of July:--\r\n\r\n\"Today the 'Universel'[22] exclaims against the report of a _coup\r\nd'etat_, and seems to guarantee the regular opening of the session by a\r\nspeech from the King. This speech, which will annoy you, will have the\r\nadvantage of opening the session on a better understanding. But the\r\ngreat point is to have a session; violent extremes become much more\r\nimprobable when we are constitutionally employed. But you will find it\r\nvery difficult to draw up a new address; whatever it may be, the right\r\nand the extreme left will look upon it in the light of a\r\nretractation,--the right as a boast, the left as a complaint. You will\r\nhave to defend yourselves against those who wish purely and simply a\r\nrepetition of the former address, and who hold to it as the last words\r\nof the country. Having acquired a victory at the elections, and the\r\nalternative of dissolution being no longer available to the King, we\r\nshall have evidently a new line of conduct to adopt. Besides, what\r\ninterest have we in compelling the King to make a stand? France has\r\nevery thing to gain by years of regular government; let us be careful\r\nnot to precipitate events.\"\r\n\r\nI replied on the 16th of July:--\"I scarcely know how we are to extricate\r\nourselves from the new address. It will be an extremely difficult\r\nmatter, but in any case we are bound to meet this difficulty, for\r\nevidently we must have a session. We should be looked upon as children\r\nand madmen if we were merely to recommence what we have taken in hand\r\nfor four months. The new Chamber ought not to retreat; but it should\r\nadopt a new course. Let us have no _coup d'etat_, and let constitutional\r\norder be regularly preserved. Whatever may be the ministerial\r\ncombinations, real and ultimate success will be with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the electors by whom I am surrounded here, I have met with\r\nnothing but moderate, patient, and loyal dispositions. M. de Daunant has\r\njust been elected, on the 13th of July instant, by the Divisional\r\nCollege of Nismes; he had 296 votes against 241 given in favour of\r\nM. Daniel Murjas, president of the college. When the result was\r\nannounced, the official secretary proposed to the assembly to pass a\r\nvote of thanks to the president, who, notwithstanding his own\r\ncandidateship, had presided with most complete impartiality and loyalty.\r\nThe vote was carried on the instant, in the midst of loud cries of \"Long\r\nlive the King!\" and the electors, as they retired, found in all quarters\r\nthe same tranquillity and gravity which they had themselves preserved in\r\nthe discharge of their own duties.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, when news of the capture of Algiers arrived, I\r\nwrote thus:--\"And so the African campaign is over, and well over; ours,\r\nwhich must commence in about two months, will be rather more difficult;\r\nbut no matter; I hope this success will not stimulate power to the last\r\nmadness, and I prefer our national honour to all parliamentary\r\nconsiderations.\"\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to assert that the foregoing sentiments were those of\r\nall who, whether in the Chambers or in the country, had approved the\r\nAddress of the Two Hundred and Twenty-one, and who, at the elections,\r\nvoted for its support. The Restoration had not achieved such complete\r\nconquests in France. Inactive, but not resigned, the secret societies\r\nwere ever in existence; ready, when opportunity occurred, to resume\r\ntheir work of conspiracy and destruction. Other adversaries, more\r\nlegitimate but not less formidable, narrowly watched every mistake of\r\nthe King and his Government, and sedulously brought them under public\r\ncomment, expecting and prognosticating still more serious errors, which\r\nwould lead to extreme consequences. Amongst the popular masses, a deeply\r\nrooted instinct of suspicion and hatred to all that recalled the old\r\nsystem and the invasion of the foreigners, continued to supply arms and\r\ninexhaustible hopes to the enemies of the Restoration. The people\r\nresemble the ocean, motionless and almost immutable at the bottom,\r\nhowever violent may be the storms which agitate the surface.\r\nNevertheless, the spirit of legality and sound political reason had made\r\nremarkable progress; even during the ferment of the elections, public\r\nfeeling loudly repudiated all idea of a new revolution. Never was the\r\nsituation of those who sincerely wished to support the King and the\r\nCharter more favourable or powerful; they had given evidences of\r\npersevering firmness by legitimate opposition, they had lately\r\nmaintained with reputation the principles of representative government,\r\nthey enjoyed the esteem and even the favour of the public; the more\r\nviolent party, through necessity, and the country, with some hesitation,\r\nmingled with honest hope, followed in their rear. If at this critical\r\nmoment they could have succeeded with the King as with the Chambers and\r\nthe country,--if Charles X., after having by the dissolution pushed his\r\nroyal prerogative to the extreme verge, had listened to the strongly\r\nmanifested wishes of France, and selected his advisers from amongst\r\nthose of the constitutional Royalists who stood the highest in public\r\nconsideration, I say, with a feeling of conviction which may appear\r\nfoolhardy, but which I maintain to this hour, that there was every\r\nreasonable hope of surmounting the last decisive trial; and that the\r\ncountry taking confidence at once in the King and in the Charter, the\r\nRestoration and constitutional government would have been established\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut the precise quality in which Charles X. was deficient, was that\r\nexpansive freedom of mind which conveys to a monarch a perfect\r\nintelligence of the age in which he lives, and endows him with a sound\r\nappreciation of its resources and necessities. \"There are only M. de La\r\nFayette and I who have not changed since 1789,\" said he, one day; and he\r\nspoke truly. Through all the vicissitudes of his life he ever remained\r\nwhat his youthful training had made him at the Court of Versailles and\r\nin the aristocratic society of the eighteenth century--sincere and\r\nlight, confident in himself and in his own immediate circle, unobservant\r\nand irreflective, although of an active spirit, attached to his ideas\r\nand his friends of the old system as to his faith and his standard.\r\nUnder the reign of his brother Louis XVIII., and during the scission of\r\nthe monarchical party, he became the patron and hope of that Royalist\r\nopposition which boldly availed itself of constitutional liberties, and\r\npresented in his own person a singular mixture of persevering intimacy\r\nwith his old companions, and of a taste for the new popularity of a\r\nLiberal. When he found himself on the throne, he made more than one\r\ncoquettish advance to this popular disposition, and sincerely flattered\r\nhimself that he governed according to the Charter, with his old friends\r\nand his ideas of earlier times. M. de Villele and M. de Martignac lent\r\nthemselves to his views in this difficult work; and after their fall,\r\nwhich he scarcely opposed, Charles X. found himself left to his natural\r\ntendencies, in the midst of advisers little disposed to contradict, and\r\nwithout the power of restraining him. Two fatal mistakes then\r\nestablished themselves in his mind; he fancied that he was menaced by\r\nthe Revolution, much more than was really the fact; and he ceased to\r\nbelieve in the possibility of defending himself, and of governing by the\r\nlegal course of the constitutional system. France had no desire for a\r\nnew revolution. The Charter contained, for a prudent and patient\r\nmonarch, certain means of exercising the royal authority and of securing\r\nthe Crown. But Charles X. had lost confidence in France and in the\r\nCharter. When the Address of the Two Hundred and Twenty-one Deputies\r\ncame triumphant through the elections, he believed that he was driven to\r\nhis last entrenchment, and reduced to save himself without the Charter,\r\nor to perish by a revolution.\r\n\r\nA few days before the Decrees of July, the Russian ambassador, Count\r\nPozzo di Borgo, had an audience of the King. He found him seated before\r\nhis desk, with his eyes fixed on the Charter, opened at Article 14.\r\nCharles X. read and re-read that article, seeking with honest inquietude\r\nthe interpretation he wanted to find there. In such cases, we always\r\ndiscover what we are in search of; and the King's conversation, although\r\nindirect and uncertain, left little doubt on the Ambassador's mind as to\r\nthe measures in preparation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"Peers of France, Deputies of Departments, I have no doubt\r\nof your co-operation in carrying out the good measures I propose. You\r\nwill repulse with contempt the perfidious insinuations which malevolence\r\nseeks to propagate. If criminal manoeuvres were to place obstacles in\r\nthe way of my government, which I neither can, nor wish to, foresee, I\r\nshould find the power of surmounting them in a resolution to maintain\r\nthe public peace, in the just confidence of the French people, and in\r\nthe devotion which they have always demonstrated for their King.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: I think no one who reads the six concluding paragraphs of\r\nthis Address, which alone formed the subject of debate, can fail to\r\nappreciate, in the present day, the profound truth of the sentiments and\r\nthe apt propriety of the language.\r\n\r\n\"Assembled at your command from all points of the kingdom, we bring to\r\nyou, Sire, from every quarter, the homage of a faithful people, still\r\nfurther inspired by having found you the most beneficent of all, in the\r\nmidst of universal beneficence, and which reveres in your person the\r\naccomplished model of the most exemplary virtues. Sire, this people\r\ncherishes and respects your authority; fifteen years of peace and\r\nliberty which it owes to your august brother and to yourself, have\r\ndeeply rooted in its heart the gratitude due to your august family: its\r\nreason, matured by experience and freedom of discussion, tells it that\r\nin questions of authority, above all others, antiquity of possession is\r\nthe holiest of titles, and that it is as much for the happiness of\r\nFrance as for your personal glory, that ages have placed your throne in\r\na region inaccessible to storms. The conviction of the nation accords\r\nthen with its duty in representing to it the sacred privileges of your\r\ncrown as the surest guarantee of its own liberties, and the integrity of\r\nyour prerogatives as necessary to the preservation of public rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Sire, in the midst of these unanimous sentiments of\r\nrespect and affection with which your people surround you, there has\r\nbecome manifest in the general mind a feeling of inquietude which\r\ndisturbs the security France had begun to enjoy, affects the sources of\r\nher prosperity, and might, if prolonged, become fatal to her repose. Our\r\nconscience, our honour, the fidelity we have pledged and which we shall\r\never maintain, impose on us the duty of unveiling to you the cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, the Charter which we owe to the wisdom of your august\r\npredecessor, and the benefits of which your Majesty has declared a firm\r\ndetermination to consolidate, consecrate as a right the intervention of\r\nthe country in the deliberation of public interests. This intervention\r\nought to be, and is in fact, indirect, wisely regulated, circumscribed\r\nwithin limits minutely defined, and which, we shall never suffer any one\r\nto exceed; but it is also positive in its result; for it establishes a\r\npermanent concurrence between the political views of your government,\r\nand the wishes of your people, as an indispensable condition of the\r\nregular progress of public affairs. Sire, our loyalty and devotion\r\ncompel us to declare that this concurrence does not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"An unjust suspicion of the sentiments and ideas of France forms the\r\nfundamental conviction of the present Ministry; your people look on this\r\nwith sorrow, as injurious to the Government itself, and with uneasiness,\r\nas it appears to menace public liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"This suspicion could find no entrance in your own noble heart. No,\r\nSire, _France is not more desirous of anarchy than you are of\r\ndespotism_.[23] She is worthy of your having faith in her loyalty, as\r\nshe relies implicitly on your promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between those who misrepresent a nation so calm and loyal, and we, who\r\nwith a deep conviction deposit in your bosom the complaints of an entire\r\npeople, jealous of the esteem and confidence of their King, let the\r\nexalted wisdom of your Majesty decide! Your royal prerogatives have\r\nplaced in your hands the means of establishing between the authorities\r\nof the State, that constitutional harmony, the first and most essential\r\ncondition for the security of the Throne and the greatness of the\r\ncountry.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: One of the ministerial journals of the time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The words used by the Chamber of Peers in their address.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIC DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIC DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nTHE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_Val-de-Loup, May 12th, 1809._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI return you a thousand thanks. I have read your articles with extreme\r\npleasure. You praise me with so much grace, and bestow on me so many\r\ncommendations, that you may easily afford to diminish the latter. Enough\r\nwill always remain to satisfy my vanity as an author, and assuredly more\r\nthan I deserve.\r\n\r\nI find your criticisms extremely just; one in particular has struck me\r\nby its refined taste. You say that the Catholics cannot, like the\r\nProtestants, admit a Christian mythology, because we have not been\r\ntrained and accustomed to it by great poets. This is most ingenious; and\r\nif my work should be considered good enough to induce people to say that\r\nI am the first to commence this mythology, it might be replied that I\r\ncome too late, that our taste is formed upon other models, etc. etc.\r\netc.... Nevertheless there will always be Tasso, and all the Latin\r\nCatholic poems of the Middle Ages. This appears to me the only solid\r\nobjection that can be raised against your remark.\r\n\r\nIn truth, and I speak with perfect sincerity, the criticisms which,\r\nbefore yours, have appeared on my work, make me feel to a certain extent\r\nashamed of the French. Have you observed that no one seems to have\r\ncomprehended its design? That the rules of epic composition are so\r\ngenerally forgotten, that a work of thought and immense labour is judged\r\nas if it were the production of a day, or a mere romance? And all this\r\noutcry is against the marvellous! Would it not imply that I am the\r\ninventor of this style? that it has been hitherto unheard of, and is\r\nsingular and new? And yet we have Tasso, Milton, Klopstock, Gessner, and\r\neven Voltaire! And if we are not to employ the marvellous in a Christian\r\nsubject, there can no longer be an epic in modern poetry, for the\r\nmarvellous is essential to that style of composition, and I believe no\r\none would be inclined to introduce Jupiter in a subject taken from our\r\nown history. All this, like every thing else in France, is insincere.\r\nThe question to be decided was, whether my work was good or bad as an\r\nepic poem; all was comprised in this point, without attempting to\r\nascertain whether it was or was not contrary to religion; and a thousand\r\nother arguments of the same kind.\r\n\r\nI cannot deliver an opinion on my own work; I can only convey to you\r\nthat of others. M. Fontanes is entirely in favour of 'The Martyrs.' He\r\nfinds this production much superior to what I have written before, in\r\nplan, style, and characters.\r\n\r\nWhat appears singular to me is, that the third Book, which you condemn,\r\nseems to him one of the best of the whole! With regard to style, he\r\nthinks that I have never before reached so high a point as in the\r\ndescription of the happiness of the just, in that of the light of\r\nHeaven, and in the passage on the Virgin. He tolerates the length of the\r\ntwo dialogues between the Father and Son, on the necessity of\r\nestablishing the epic machinery. Without these dialogues there could be\r\nno more narrative or action; the narrative and action are accounted for\r\nby the conversation of the uncreated beings.\r\n\r\nI mention this, Sir, not to convince, but to show you how sound\r\njudgments can see the same object under different aspects. With you I\r\ndislike the description of torture, but I consider it absolutely\r\nnecessary in a work upon Martyrs. It has been consecrated by all history\r\nand every art. Christian painting and sculpture have selected these\r\nsubjects; herein lies the real controversy of the question. You, Sir,\r\nwho are well acquainted with the details, know to what extent I have\r\nsoftened the picture, and how much I have suppressed of the _Acta\r\nMartyrum_, particularly in holding back physical agony, and in opposing\r\nagreeable images to harrowing torments. You are too just not to\r\ndistinguish between the objections of the subject and the errors of the\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, you, Sir, well know the tempest raised against my work,\r\nand the source from whence they proceed. There is another sore not\r\nopenly displayed, and which lies at the root of all this anger. It is\r\nthat _Hierocles_ massacres the Christians in the name of _philosophy_\r\nand _liberty_. Time will do me justice if my book deserves it, and you\r\nwill greatly accelerate this judgment by publishing your articles, if\r\nyou could be induced to modify them to a certain extent. Show me my\r\nfaults and I will correct them. I only despise those writers, who are as\r\ncontemptible in their language as in the secret reasons which prompt\r\nthem to speak. I can neither find reason nor honour in the mouths of\r\nthose literary mountebanks in the hire of the Police, who dance in the\r\nkennels for the amusement of lacqueys.\r\n\r\nI am in my cottage, where I shall be delighted to hear from you. It\r\nwould give me the greatest pleasure to receive you here, if you would be\r\nso kind as to visit me. Accept the assurance of my profound esteem and\r\nhigh consideration.\r\n\r\nDE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_Val-de-Loup, May 30th, 1809._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nFar from troubling me, you have given me the greatest pleasure in doing\r\nme the favour to communicate your ideas. This time I shall condemn the\r\nintroduction of the marvellous in a Christian subject, and am willing to\r\nbelieve with you, that it will never be adopted in France. But I cannot\r\nadmit that 'The Martyrs' are founded on a heresy. The question is not of\r\na _redemption_, which would be absurd, but of an _expiation_, which is\r\nentirely consistent with faith. In all ages, the Church has held that\r\nthe blood of a martyr could efface the sins of the people, and deliver\r\nthem from their penalties. Undoubtedly you know, better than I do, that\r\nformerly, in times of war and calamity, a monk was confined in a tower\r\nor a cell, where he fasted and prayed for the salvation of all. I have\r\nnot left my intention in doubt, for in the third Book I have caused it\r\nto be positively declared to the Eternal that Eudore will draw the\r\nblessings of Heaven upon the Christians through the merits of the blood\r\nof the Saviour. This, as you see, is precisely the orthodox phrase, and\r\nthe exact lesson of the catechism. The doctrine of expiation, so\r\nconsolatory in other respects, and consecrated by antiquity, has been\r\nacknowledged in our religion: its mission from Christ has not destroyed\r\nit. And I may observe, incidentally, that I hope the sacrifice of some\r\ninnocent victim, condemned in the Revolution, will obtain from Heaven\r\nthe pardon of our guilty country. Those whom we have slaughtered are,\r\nperhaps, praying for us at this very moment. Surely you cannot wish to\r\nrenounce this sublime hope, which springs from the tears and blood of\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the frankness and sincerity of your conduct make me\r\nforget for a moment the baseness of the present age. What can we think\r\nof a time when an honest man is told, \"You will pronounce on such a\r\nwork, such an opinion; you will praise or blame it, not according to\r\nyour conscience, but according to the spirit of the journal in which you\r\nwrite\"! We are too happy to find critics like you, who stand up against\r\nsuch conventional baseness, and preserve the tradition of honour for\r\nhuman nature. As a conclusive estimate, if you carefully examine 'The\r\nMartyrs,' undoubtedly you will find much to reprehend; but taking all\r\npoints into consideration, you will see that in plan, characters, and\r\nstyle, it is the best and least defective of my feeble writings.\r\n\r\nI have a nephew in Russia, named Moreau, the grandson of a sister of my\r\nmother; I am scarcely acquainted with him, but I believe him to be an\r\nhonourable man. His father, who was also in Russia, returned to France\r\nabout a year ago. I have been delighted with the opportunity which\r\nhas procured for me the honour of becoming acquainted with\r\nMademoiselle de Meulan; she has appeared to me, as in all that she\r\nwrites, full of mind, good taste, and sense. I much fear that I\r\ninconvenienced her by the length of my visit; I have the fault of\r\nremaining wherever I find amiable acquaintances, and especially when I\r\nmeet exalted characters and noble sentiments.\r\n\r\nI repeat most sincerely the assurance of my high esteem, gratitude, and\r\ndevotion. I look forward with impatience to the moment when I can either\r\nreceive you in my hermitage, or visit you in your solitude.\r\n\r\n   Accept, I pray you, my sincerest compliments.\r\n   DE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_Val-de-Loup, June 12th, 1809._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI happened to be absent from my valley for several days, which has\r\nprevented me from replying sooner to your letters. Behold me thoroughly\r\nconvinced of heresy. I admit that the word _redeemed_ escaped me\r\ninadvertently, and in truth contrary to my intention. But there it is,\r\nand I shall efface it from the next edition.\r\n\r\nI have read your first two articles, and repeat my thanks for them. They\r\nare excellent, and you praise me far beyond what I deserve. What has\r\nbeen said with respect to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is quite\r\ncorrect. The description could only have been given by one who knows the\r\nlocalities. But the Holy Sepulchre itself might easily have escaped the\r\nfire without a special miracle. It forms, in the middle of the circular\r\nnave of the church, a kind of catafalque of white marble: the cupola of\r\ncedar, in falling, might have crushed it, but could not have set it on\r\nfire. It is nevertheless a very extraordinary circumstance, and one\r\nworthy of much longer details than can be confined within the limits of\r\na letter.\r\n\r\nI wish much that I could relate these particulars to you, personally, in\r\nyour retirement. Unfortunately, Madame de Chateaubriand is ill, and I\r\ncannot leave her. But I do not give up the idea of paying you a visit,\r\nnor of receiving you here in my hermitage. Honourable men ought,\r\nparticularly at present, to unite for mutual consolation. Generous ideas\r\nand exalted sentiments become every day so rare that we ought to be too\r\nhappy when we encounter them. I should be delighted if my society could\r\nprove agreeable to you, as also to M. Stapfer, to whom I beg you will\r\nconvey my warmest thanks.\r\n\r\nAccept once more, I pray you, the assurance of my high consideration and\r\nsincere devotion, and if you will permit me to add, of a friendship\r\nwhich is commenced under the auspices of frankness and honour.\r\n\r\nDE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best description of Jerusalem is that of Danville; but his little\r\ntreatise is very scarce. In general, all travellers are very exact as to\r\nPalestine; there is a letter in the 'Lettres Edifiantes' ('Missions to\r\nthe Levant'), which leaves nothing to be desired. With regard to\r\nM. de Volney, he is valuable on the government of the Turks, but it is\r\nevident that he has not been at Jerusalem. It is probable that he never\r\nwent beyond Ramleh or Rama, the ancient Arimathea. You may also consult\r\nthe 'Theatrum Terrae Sanctae' of Adrichomius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT DE LALLY-TOLENDAL TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_Brussels, April 27th, 1811._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou will be unable to account for my silence, as I found it difficult to\r\nunderstand the tardy arrival of the prospectuses you had promised me in\r\nyour letter of the fourth of this month. I must explain to you that the\r\nporter here had confounded that packet with the files of unimportant\r\nprinted papers addressed to a Prefecture, and if the want of a book had\r\nnot induced me to visit the private study of the Prefect, I should\r\nperhaps have not yet discovered the mistake. I thank you for the\r\nconfidence with which you have treated me on this occasion. You are\r\naware that no one renders you more than I do, the full justice to which\r\nyou are entitled, and you also know that I accord it equally from\r\ninclination and conviction. My generation has passed away, yours is in\r\nfull action, and a third is on the point of rising. I see you placed\r\nbetween two, to console the first, to do honour to the second, and to\r\nform the third. Endeavour to make the last like yourself; by which I do\r\nnot mean that I wish all the little boys to know as much as you do, or\r\nall the little girls to resemble in everything, your more than amiable\r\npartner. We must not desire what we cannot obtain, and I should too much\r\nregret my own decline if such an attractive age were about to commence.\r\nBut restrain my idea within its due limits, and dictate like Solon the\r\nbest laws which the infancy of the nineteenth century can bear or\r\nreceive; this will abundantly suffice. Today the _mox progeniem daturos\r\nvitiosiorem_ would make one's hair stand on end.\r\n\r\nMadame de la Tour du Pin, a Baroness of the Empire for two years, a\r\nPrefectess of the Dyle for three, and a religious mother for twenty,\r\nwill recommend your journal with all the influence of her two first\r\ntitles, and subscribes to it with all the interest that the last can\r\ninspire. I, who have no other pretension, and desire no other, than that\r\nof a father and a friend, request your permission to subscribe for my\r\ndaughter, who, commencing the double education of a little Arnaud and a\r\nlittle Leontine, will be delighted to profit by your double instruction.\r\nI believe also that the grandfather himself will often obtain knowledge,\r\nand always pleasure, from the same source. It seems to me that no\r\nassociation could be more propitious to the union of the _utile dulci_.\r\nIf I were to allow free scope to my pen, I feel assured that I should\r\nwrite thus like a madman to one of the two authors: \"Not being able to\r\nmake myself once more young, to adore your merits, I become an old\r\ninfant, to receive your lessons. I kiss from a distance the hand of my\r\nyouthful nurse, with the most profound respect, but not sufficiently\r\nabstracted from some of those emotions which have followed my first\r\nchildhood, and which my second education ought to correct. Is it\r\npossible to submit to your rod with more ingenuousness? At least I\r\nconfess my faults. As I am bound to speak the truth, I dare not yet add,\r\n_this can never happen to me again_. But the strong resolution will come\r\nwith weak age; and the more I can transform myself, the nearer I shall\r\napproach perfection.\"\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to present my respects to Madame and Mademoiselle\r\nde Meulan. Have you not a very excellent and amiable young man (another\r\nof the few who are consoled by elevation and purity of mind), the nephew\r\nof M. Hocher, residing under the same roof with yourself? If so, I beg\r\nyou to recall me to his remembrance, and through him to that of his\r\nuncle, from whom I expect, with much anxiety, an answer upon a matter of\r\nthe greatest interest to the uncle of my son-in-law, in the installation\r\nof the Imperial Courts. But nothing has arrived by the post.\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing to you of our good and estimable friends of the\r\nPlace Louis Quinze, for I am going to write to them directly.\r\n\r\nBut it has just occurred to me to entreat a favour of you before I close\r\nmy letter. When, in your precepts to youth, you arrive at the chapter\r\nand age which treats of the choice of a profession, I implore you to\r\ninsert something to this effect: \"If your vocation leads you to be a\r\npublisher or editor of any work, moral, political, or historical, it\r\nmatters not which, do not consider yourself at liberty to mutilate an\r\nauthor without his previous knowledge, and above all, one who is\r\ntenacious of the inviolability of his text more from conscience than\r\nself-love. If you mutilate him on your own responsibility, which is\r\ntolerably bold, do not believe that you are permitted to substitute a\r\nfictitious member of your own construction for the living one you have\r\nlopped off; and be cautious lest, without being aware of it, you replace\r\nan arm of flesh by a wooden leg. But break up all your presses rather\r\nthan make him say, under the seal of his own signature, the contrary of\r\nwhat he has written, thought, or felt. To do this is an offence almost\r\namounting to a moral crime.\" I write more at length on this topic to my\r\nfriends of the Place Louis Quinze, and I beg you to speak to none but\r\nthem of my enigma, which assuredly you have already solved; I hope that\r\nwhat has now offended and vexed me will not happen again. In saying what\r\nwas necessary, I used very guarded expressions. I do not wish a rupture,\r\nthe vengeance of which might fall on cherished memories or living\r\nfriends. My letter has taken a very serious turn; I little thought, when\r\nI began, that it would lead me to this conclusion. I feel that I am in\r\nconversation with you, and carried away by full confidence. It is most\r\ngratifying to me to have added an involuntary proof of this sentiment to\r\nthe spontaneous expression of all those with which you have so deeply\r\ninspired me, and the assurance of which I have the honour to repeat,\r\naccompanied by my sincere salutations.\r\n\r\nLALLY-TOLENDAL.\r\n\r\nP.S. Allow me to enclose the addresses for the two subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discourse delivered by M. GUIZOT, on the opening of his first Course of\r\nLectures on Modern History. December 11th, 1812._\r\n\r\nA statesman equally celebrated for his character and misfortunes, Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, had published the first part of a 'History of the\r\nWorld;' while confined in the Tower, he employed himself in finishing\r\nthe second. A quarrel arose in one of the courts of the prison; he\r\nlooked on attentively at the contest, which became sanguinary, and left\r\nthe window with his imagination strongly impressed by the scene that had\r\npassed under his eyes. On the morrow a friend came to visit him, and\r\nrelated what had occurred. But great was his surprise when this friend,\r\nwho had been present at and even engaged in the occurrence of the\r\npreceding day, proved to him that this event, in its result as well as\r\nin its particulars, was precisely the contrary of what he had believed\r\nhe saw. Raleigh, when left alone, took up his manuscript and threw it in\r\nthe fire; convinced that, as he had been so completely deceived with\r\nrespect to the details of an incident he had actually witnessed, he\r\ncould know nothing whatever of those he had just described with his pen.\r\n\r\nAre we better informed or more fortunate than Sir Walter Raleigh? The\r\nmost confident historian would hesitate to answer this question directly\r\nin the affirmative. History relates a long series of events, and depicts\r\na vast number of characters; and let us recollect, gentlemen, the\r\ndifficulty of thoroughly understanding a single character or a solitary\r\nevent. Montaigne, after having passed his life in self-study, was\r\ncontinually making new discoveries on his own nature; he has filled a\r\nlong work with them, and ends by saying, \"Man is a subject so\r\ndiversified, so uncertain and vain, that it is difficult to pronounce\r\nany fixed and uniform opinion on him.\" He is, in fact, an obscure\r\ncompound of an infinity of ideas and sentiments, which change and modify\r\nthemselves reciprocally, and of which it is as difficult to disentangle\r\nthe sources as to foresee the results. An uncertain produce of a\r\nmultiplicity of circumstances, sometimes impenetrable, always\r\ncomplicated, often unknown to the person influenced by them, and not\r\neven suspected by those who surround him, man scarcely learns how to\r\nknow himself, and is never more than guessed at by others. The simplest\r\nmind, if it attempted to examine and describe itself, would impart to us\r\na thousand secrets, of which we have not the most remote suspicion. And\r\nhow many different men are comprised in an event! how many whose\r\ncharacters have influenced that event, and have modified its nature,\r\nprogress, and effects! Bring together circumstances in perfect\r\naccordance; suppose situations exactly similar: let a single actor\r\nchange, and all is changed. He is urged by fresh motives, and desires\r\nnew objects. Take the same actors, and alter but one of those\r\ncircumstances independent of human will, which are called chance or\r\ndestiny; and all is changed again. It is from this infinity of details,\r\nwhere everything is obscure, and nothing isolated, that history is\r\ncomposed; and man, proud of what he knows, because he forgets to think\r\nof how much he is ignorant, believes that he has acquired a full\r\nknowledge of history when he has read what some few have told him, who\r\nhad no better means of understanding the times in which they lived, than\r\nwe possess of justly estimating our own.\r\n\r\nWhat then are we to seek and find in the darkness of the past, which\r\nthickens as it recedes from us? If Caesar, Sallust, or Tacitus have only\r\nbeen able to transmit doubtful and imperfect notions, can we rely on\r\nwhat they relate? And if we are not to trust them, how are we to supply\r\nourselves with information? Shall we be capable of disembarrassing our\r\nminds of those ideas and manners, and of that new existence, which a new\r\norder of things has produced, to adopt momentarily in our thoughts other\r\nmanners and ideas, and a different character of being? Must we learn to\r\nbecome Greeks, Romans, or Barbarians, in order to understand these\r\nRomans, Barbarians, or Greeks, before we venture to judge them? And even\r\nif we could attain this difficult abnegation of an actual and imperious\r\nreality, should we become then as well acquainted with the history of\r\nthe times of which they tell us, as were Caesar, Sallust, or Tacitus?\r\nAfter being thus transported to the midst of the world they describe, we\r\nshould find gaps in their delineations, of which we have at present no\r\nconception, and of which they were not always sensible themselves. That\r\nmultiplicity of facts which, grouped together and viewed from a\r\ndistance, appear to fill time and space, would present to us, if we\r\nfound ourselves placed on the ground they occupy, as voids which we\r\nshould find it impossible to fill up, and which the historians leave\r\nthere designedly, because he who relates or describes what he sees, to\r\nothers who see equally with himself, never feels called upon to\r\nrecapitulate all that he knows.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore refrain from supposing that history can present to us,\r\nin reality, an exact picture of the past; the world is too extensive,\r\nthe night of time too obscure, and man too weak for such a portrait to\r\nbe ever a complete reflection.\r\n\r\nBut can it be true that such important knowledge is entirely interdicted\r\nto us?--that in what we can acquire, all is a subject of doubt and\r\nerror? Does the mind only enlighten itself to increase its wavering?\r\nDoes it develope all its strength, merely to end in a confession of\r\nignorance?--a painful and disheartening idea, which many men of superior\r\nintellect have encountered in their course, but by which they ought\r\nnever to have been impeded!\r\n\r\nMan seldom asks himself what he really requires to know, in his ardent\r\npursuit of knowledge; he need only cast a glance upon his studies, to\r\ndiscover two divisions, the difference between which is striking,\r\nalthough we may be unable to assign the boundaries that separate them.\r\nEverywhere we perceive a certain innocent but futile labour, which\r\nattaches itself to questions and inquiries equally inaccessible and\r\nwithout results--which has no other object than to satisfy the restless\r\ncuriosity of minds, the first want of which is occupation; and\r\neverywhere, also, we observe useful, productive, and interesting\r\ninquiry, not only advantageous to those who indulge in it, but\r\nbeneficial to human nature at large. What time and talent have men\r\nwasted in metaphysical lucubrations! They have sought to penetrate the\r\ninternal nature of things, of the mind, and of matter; they have taken\r\npurely vague combinations of words for substantial realities; but these\r\nvery researches, or others which have arisen out of them, have\r\nenlightened us upon the order of our faculties, the laws by which they\r\nare governed, and the progress of their development; we have acquired\r\nfrom thence a history, a statistic of the human mind; and if no one has\r\nbeen able to tell us what it is, we have at least learned how it acts,\r\nand how we ought to act to strengthen its justice and extend its range.\r\n\r\nWas not the study of astronomy for a long time directed to the dreams of\r\nastrology? Gassendi himself began to investigate it with that view; and\r\nwhen science cured him of the prejudices of superstition, he repented\r\nthat he so openly declared his conversion, because, he said, many\r\npersons formerly studied astronomy to become astrologers, and he now\r\nperceived that they ceased to learn astronomy, since he had condemned\r\nastrology. Who then can prove to us that, without the restlessness of\r\nanticipation which had led men to seek the future in the stars, the\r\nscience, by which today our ships are directed, would ever have reached\r\nits present perfection?\r\n\r\nIt is thus that we shall ever find, in the labours of man, one half\r\nfruitless, by the side of another moiety profitable; we shall then no\r\nlonger condemn the curiosity which leads to knowledge; we shall\r\nacknowledge that, if the human mind often wanders in its path, if it has\r\nnot always selected the most direct road, it has finally arrived, by the\r\nnecessity of its nature, at the discovery of important truths; but, with\r\nprogressive enlightenment, we shall endeavour not to lose time, to go\r\nstraight to the end by concentrating our strength on fruitful inquiries\r\nand profitable results; and we shall soon convince ourselves that what\r\nman cannot do is valueless, and that he can achieve all that is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe application of this idea to history will soon remove the difficulty\r\nwhich its uncertainty raised at the outset. For example, it is of little\r\nconsequence to us to know the exact personal appearance or the precise\r\nday of the birth of Constantine; to ascertain what particular motives or\r\nindividual feelings may have influenced his determination or conduct on\r\nany given occasion; to be acquainted with all the details of his wars\r\nand victories in the struggles with Maxentius or Licinius: these minor\r\npoints concern the monarch alone; and the monarch exists no longer. The\r\nanxiety some scholars display in hunting them out is merely a\r\nconsequence of the interest which attaches to great names and important\r\nreminiscences. But the results of the conversion of Constantine, his\r\nadministrative system, the political and religious principles which he\r\nestablished in his empire,--these are the matters which it imports the\r\npresent generation to investigate; for they do not expire with a\r\nparticular age, they form the destiny and glory of nations, they confer\r\nor take away the use of the most noble faculties of man; they either\r\nplunge them silently into a state of misery alternately submissive and\r\nrebellious, or establish for them the foundation of a lasting\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, to a certain extent, that there are two pasts, the one\r\nentirely extinct and without real interest, because its influence has\r\nnot extended beyond its actual duration; the other enduring for ever by\r\nthe empire it has exercised over succeeding ages, and by that alone\r\npreserved to our knowledge, since what remains of it is there to\r\nenlighten us upon what has perished. History presents us, at every\r\nepoch, with some predominant ideas, some great events which have decided\r\nthe fortune and character of a long series of generations. These ideas\r\nand events have left monuments which still remain, or which long\r\nremained, on the face of the world; an extended trace, in perpetuating\r\nthe memory and effect of their existence, has multiplied the materials\r\nsuitable for our guidance in the researches of which they are the\r\nobject; reason itself can here supply us with its positive data to\r\nconduct us through the uncertain labyrinth of facts. In a past event\r\nthere may have been some particular circumstance at present unknown,\r\nwhich would completely alter the idea we have formed of it. Thus, we\r\nshall never discover the reason which delayed Hannibal at Capua, and\r\nsaved Rome; but in an effect which has endured for a long time, we\r\neasily ascertain the nature of its cause. The despotic authority which\r\nthe Roman Senate exercised for ages over the people, explains to us the\r\nideas of liberty within which the Senators restricted themselves when\r\nthey expelled their kings. Let us then follow the path in which we can\r\nhave reason for our guide; let us apply the principles, with which she\r\nfurnishes us, to the examples borrowed from history. Man, in the\r\nignorance and weakness to which the narrow limits of his life and\r\nfaculties condemn him, has received reason to supply knowledge, as\r\nindustry is given to him in place of strength.\r\n\r\nSuch, gentlemen, is the point of view under which we shall endeavour to\r\ncontemplate history. We shall seek, in the annals of nations, a\r\nknowledge of the human race; we shall try to discover what, in every age\r\nand state of civilization, have been the prevailing ideas and\r\nprinciples in general adoption, which have produced the happiness or\r\nmisery of the generations subjected to their power, and have influenced\r\nthe destiny of those which succeeded them. The subject is one of the\r\nmost abundant in considerations of this nature. History presents to us\r\nperiods of development, during which man, emerging from a state of\r\nbarbarism and ignorance, arrives gradually at a condition of science and\r\nadvancement, which may decline, but can never perish, for knowledge is\r\nan inheritance that always finds heirs. The civilization of the\r\nEgyptians and Phoenicians prepared that of the Greeks; while that of\r\nthe Romans was not lost to the barbarians who established themselves\r\nupon the ruins of the Empire. No preceding age has ever enjoyed the\r\nadvantage we possess, of studying this slow but real progression: while\r\nlooking back on the past, we can recognize the route which the human\r\nrace has followed in Europe for more than two thousand years. Modern\r\nhistory alone, from its vast scope, from the variety and extent of its\r\nduration, offers us the grandest and most complete picture which we\r\ncould possibly possess of the civilization of a certain portion of the\r\nglobe. A rapid glance will suffice to indicate the character and\r\ninterest of the subject.\r\n\r\nRome had conquered what her pride delighted to call the world. Western\r\nAsia, from the frontiers of Persia, the North of Africa, Greece,\r\nMacedonia, Thrace, all the countries situated on the right bank of the\r\nDanube, from its source to its mouth, Italy, Gaul, Great Britain, and\r\nSpain, acknowledged her authority. That authority extended over more\r\nthan a thousand leagues in breadth, from the Wall of Antoninus and the\r\nsouthern boundaries of Dacia, to Mount Atlas;--and beyond fifteen\r\nhundred leagues in length, from the Euphrates to the Western Ocean. But\r\nif the immense extent of these conquests at first surprises the\r\nimagination, the astonishment diminishes when we consider how easy they\r\nwere of accomplishment, and how uncertain of duration. In Asia, Rome\r\nhad only to contend with effeminate races; in Europe, with ignorant\r\nsavages, whose governments, without union, regularity, or vigour, were\r\nunable to contend with the strong constitution of the Roman aristocracy.\r\nLet us pause a moment to reflect on this. Rome found it more difficult\r\nto defend herself against Hannibal than to subjugate the world; and as\r\nsoon as the world was subdued, Rome began to lose, by degrees, all that\r\nshe had won by conquest. How could she maintain her power? The\r\ncomparative state of civilization between the victors and the vanquished\r\nhad prevented union or consolidation into one substantial and\r\nhomogeneous whole; there was no extended and regular administration, no\r\ngeneral and safe communication; the provinces were only connected with\r\nRome by the tribute they paid; Rome was unknown in the provinces, except\r\nby the tribute she exacted. Everywhere, in Asia Minor, in Africa, in\r\nSpain, in Britain, in the North of Gallia, small colonies defended and\r\nmaintained their independence; all the power of the Emperors was\r\ninadequate to compel the submission of the Isaurians. The whole formed a\r\nchaos of nations half vanquished and semi-barbarous, without interest or\r\nexistence in the State of which they were considered a portion, and\r\nwhich Rome denominated the Empire.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this Empire conquered, than it began to dissolve, and that\r\nhaughty city which looked upon every region as subdued where she could,\r\nby maintaining an army, appoint a proconsul, and levy imposts, soon saw\r\nherself compelled to abandon, almost voluntarily, the possessions she\r\nwas unable to retain. In the year of Christ 270, Aurelian retired from\r\nDacia, and tacitly abandoned that territory to the Goths; in 412,\r\nHonorius recognized the independence of Great Britain and Armorica; in\r\n428, he wished the inhabitants of Gallia Narbonensis to govern\r\nthemselves. On all sides we see the Romans abandoning, without being\r\ndriven out, countries whose obedience, according to the expression of\r\nMontesquieu, _weighed upon them_, and which, never having been\r\nincorporated with the Empire, were sure to separate from it on the first\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nThe shock came from a quarter which the Romans, notwithstanding their\r\npride, had never considered one of their provinces. Even more barbarous\r\nthan the Gauls, the Britons, and the Spaniards, the Germans had never\r\nbeen conquered, because their innumerable tribes, without fixed\r\nresidences or country, ever ready to advance or retreat, sometimes threw\r\nthemselves, with their wives and flocks, upon the possessions of Rome,\r\nand at others retired before her armies, leaving nothing for conquest\r\nbut a country without inhabitants, which they re-occupied as soon as the\r\nweakness or distance of the conquerors afforded them the opportunity. It\r\nis to this wandering life of a hunting nation, to this facility of\r\nflight and return, rather than to superior bravery, that the Germans\r\nwere indebted for the preservation of their independence. The Gauls and\r\nSpaniards had also defended themselves courageously; but the one,\r\nsurrounded by the ocean, knew not where to fly from enemies they could\r\nnot expel; and the other, in a state of more advanced civilization,\r\nattacked by the Romans, to whom the Narbonnese province afforded, in the\r\nvery heart of Gaul itself, an impregnable base, and repulsed by the\r\nGermans from the land into which they might have escaped, were also\r\ncompelled to submit. Drusus and Germanicus had long before penetrated\r\ninto Germany; they withdrew, because the Germans always retreating\r\nbefore them, they would, by remaining, have only occupied territory\r\nwithout subjects.\r\n\r\nWhen, from causes not connected with the Roman Empire, the Tartar tribes\r\nwho wandered through the deserts of Sarmatia and Scythia, from the\r\nnorthern frontiers of China, marched upon Germany, the Germans, pressed\r\nby these new invaders, threw themselves upon the Roman provinces, to\r\nconquer possessions where they might establish themselves in\r\nperpetuity. Rome then fought in defence; the struggle was protracted;\r\nthe skill and courage of some of the Emperors for a long time opposed a\r\npowerful barrier; but the Barbarians were the ultimate conquerors,\r\nbecause it was imperative on them to win the victory, and their swarms\r\nof warriors were inexhaustible. The Visigoths, the Alani, and the Suevi\r\nestablished themselves in the South, of Gaul and Spain; the Vandals\r\npassed over into Africa; the Huns occupied the banks of the Danube; the\r\nOstrogoths founded their kingdom in Italy; the Franks in the North of\r\nGaul; Rome ceased to call herself the mistress of Europe; Constantinople\r\ndoes not apply to our present subject.\r\n\r\nThose nations of the East and the North who transported themselves in a\r\nmass into the countries where they were destined to found States, the\r\nmore durable because they conquered not to extend but to establish\r\nthemselves, were barbarians, such as the Romans themselves had long\r\nremained. Force was their law, savage independence their delight; they\r\nwere free because none of them had ever thought or believed that men as\r\nstrong as themselves would submit to their domination; they were brave\r\nbecause courage with them was a necessity; they loved war because war\r\nbrings occupation without labour; they desired lands because these new\r\npossessions supplied them with a thousand novel sources of enjoyment,\r\nwhich they could indulge in while giving themselves up to idleness. They\r\nhad chiefs because men leagued together always have leaders, and because\r\nthe bravest, ever held in high consideration, soon become the most\r\npowerful, and bequeath to their descendants a portion of their own\r\npersonal influence. These chiefs became kings; the old subjects of Rome,\r\nwho at first had only been called upon to receive, to lodge, and feed\r\ntheir new masters, were soon compelled to surrender to them a portion of\r\ntheir estates; and as the labourer, as well as the plant, attaches\r\nhimself to the soil that nourishes him, the lands and the labourers\r\nbecame the property of these turbulent and lazy owners. Thus feudalism\r\nwas established,--not suddenly, not by an express convention between the\r\nchief and his followers, not by an immediate and regular division of the\r\nconquered country amongst the conquerors, but by degrees, after long\r\nyears of uncertainty, by the simple force of circumstances, as must\r\nalways happen when conquest is followed by transplantation and continued\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nWe should be wrong in supposing that the barbarians were destitute of\r\nall moral convictions. Man, in that early epoch of civilization, does\r\nnot reflect upon what we call duties; but he knows and respects, amongst\r\nhis fellow-beings, certain rights, some traces of which are discoverable\r\neven under the empire of the most absolute force. A simple code of\r\njustice, often violated, and cruelly avenged, regulates the simple\r\nintercourse of associated savages. The Germans, unacquainted with any\r\nother laws or ties, found themselves suddenly transported into the midst\r\nof an order of things founded on different ideas, and demanding\r\ndifferent restrictions. This gave them no trouble; their passage was too\r\nrapid to enable them to ascertain and supply what was deficient in their\r\nlegislature and policy. Bestowing little thought on their new subjects,\r\nthey continued to follow the same principles and customs which recently,\r\nin the forests of Germany, had regulated their conduct and decided their\r\nquarrels. Thus the conquered people were, at first, more forgotten than\r\nvanquished, more despised than oppressed; they constituted the mass of\r\nthe nation, and this mass found itself controlled without being reduced\r\nto servitude, because they were not thought of, and because the\r\nconquerors never suspected that they could possess rights which they\r\nfeared to defend. From thence sprang, in the sequel, that long disorder\r\nat the commencement of the Middle Ages, during which everything was\r\nisolated, fortuitous, and partial; hence also proceeded the absolute\r\nseparation between the nobles and the people, and those abuses of the\r\nfeudal system which only became portions of a system when long\r\npossession had caused to be looked upon as a right, what at first was\r\nonly the produce of conquest and chance.\r\n\r\nThe clergy alone, to whom the conversion of the victors afforded the\r\nmeans of acquiring a power so much the greater that its force and extent\r\ncould only be judged by the opinion it directed, maintained their\r\nprivileges, and secured their independence. The religion which the\r\nGermans embraced became the only channel through which they derived new\r\nideas, the sole point of contact between them and the inhabitants of\r\ntheir adopted country. The clergy, at first, thought only of their own\r\ninterest; in this mode of communication, all the immediate advantages of\r\nthe invasion of the barbarians were reaped by them for themselves. The\r\nliberal and beneficent influences of Christianity expanded slowly; that\r\nof religious animosity and theological dispute was the first to make\r\nitself felt. It was only in the class occupied by those dissensions, and\r\nexcited by those rancorous feelings, that energetic men were yet to be\r\nfound in the Roman Empire; religious sentiments and duties had revived,\r\nin hearts penetrated with their importance, a degree of zeal long\r\nextinguished. St. Athanasius and St. Ambrose had alone resisted\r\nConstantine and Theodosius; their successors were the sole opponents who\r\nwithstood the barbarians. This gave rise to the long empire of spiritual\r\npower, sustained with devotion and perseverance, and so weakly or\r\nfruitlessly assailed. We may say now, without fear, that the noblest\r\ncharacters, the men most distinguished by their ability or courage,\r\nthroughout this period of misfortune and calamity, belonged to the\r\necclesiastical order; and no other epoch of history supplies, in such a\r\nremarkable manner, the confirmation of this truth, so honourable to\r\nhuman nature, and perhaps the most instructive of all others,--that the\r\nmost exalted virtues still spring up and develope themselves in the\r\nbosom of the most pernicious errors.\r\n\r\nTo these general features, intended to depict the ideas, manners, and\r\nconditions of men during the Middle Ages, it would be easy to add\r\nothers, not less characteristic, and infinitely more minute. We should\r\nfind poetry and literature, those beautiful and delightful emanations of\r\nthe mind, the seeds of which have never been choked by all the follies\r\nand miseries of humanity, take birth in the very heart of barbarism, and\r\ncharm the barbarians themselves by a new species of enjoyment. We should\r\nfind the source and true character of that poetical, warlike, and\r\nreligious enthusiasm which created chivalry and the crusades. We should\r\nprobably discover, in the wandering lives of the knights and crusaders,\r\nthe reflected influence of the roving habits of the German hunters, of\r\nthat propensity to remove, and that superabundance of population, which\r\never exist where social order is not sufficiently well regulated for man\r\nto feel satisfied with his condition and locality; and before laborious\r\nindustry has taught him to compel the earth to supply him with certain\r\nand abundant subsistence. Perhaps, also, that principle of honour which\r\ninviolably attached the German barbarians to a leader of their own\r\nchoice, that individual liberty of which it was the fruit, and which\r\ngives man such an elevated idea of his own individual importance; that\r\nempire of the imagination which obtains such control over all young\r\nnations, and induces them to attempt the first steps beyond physical\r\nwants and purely material incitements, might furnish us with the causes\r\nof the elevation, enthusiasm, and devotion which, sometimes detaching\r\nthe nobles of the Middle Ages from their habitual rudeness, inspired\r\nthem with the noble sentiments and virtues that even in the present day\r\ncommand our admiration. We should then feel little surprised at seeing\r\nbarbarity and heroism united, so much energy combined with so much\r\nweakness, and the natural coarseness of man in a savage state blended\r\nwith the most sublime aspirations of moral refinement.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the latter half of the fifteenth century to witness\r\nthe birth of events destined to introduce new manners and a fresh order\r\nof politics into Europe, and to lead the world towards the direction it\r\nfollows at present. Italy, we may say, discovered the civilization of\r\nthe Greeks; the letters, arts, and ideas of that brilliant antiquity\r\ninspired universal enthusiasm. The long quarrels of the Italian\r\nRepublics, after having forced men to display their utmost energy, made\r\nthem also feel the necessity of a period of repose ennobled and charmed\r\nby the occupations of the mind. The study of classic literature supplied\r\nthe means; they were seized with ardour. Popes, cardinals, princes,\r\nnobles, and men of genius gave themselves up to learned researches; they\r\nwrote to each other, they travelled to communicate their mutual labours,\r\nto discover, to read, and to copy ancient manuscripts. The discovery of\r\nprinting came to render these communications easy and prompt; to make\r\nthis commerce of the mind extended and prolific. No other event has so\r\npowerfully influenced human civilization. Books became a tribune from\r\nwhich the world was addressed. That world was soon doubled. The compass\r\nopened safe roads across the monotonous immensity of the seas. America\r\nwas discovered; and the sight of new manners, the agitation of new\r\ninterests which were no longer the trifling concerns of one town or\r\ncastle with another, but the great transactions of mighty powers,\r\nchanged entirely the ideas of individuals and the political intercourse\r\nof States.\r\n\r\nThe invention of gunpowder had already altered their military relations;\r\nthe issue of battles no longer depended on the isolated bravery of\r\nwarriors, but on the power and skill of leaders. It has not yet been\r\nsufficiently investigated to what extent this discovery has secured\r\nmonarchical authority, and given rise to the balance of power.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Reformation struck a deadly blow against spiritual\r\nsupremacy, the consequences of which are attributable to the bold\r\nexamination of the theological questions and political shocks which led\r\nto the separation of religious sects, rather than to the new dogmas\r\nadopted by the Reformers as the foundation of their belief.\r\n\r\nFigure to yourselves, gentlemen, the effect which these united causes\r\nwere calculated to produce in the midst of the fermentation by which the\r\nhuman species was at that time excited, in the progress of the\r\nsuperabundant energy and activity which characterized the Middle Ages.\r\nFrom that time, this activity, so long unregulated, began to organize\r\nitself and advance towards a defined object; this energy submitted to\r\nlaws; isolation disappeared; the human race formed itself into one great\r\nbody; public opinion assumed influence; and if an age of civil wars, of\r\nreligious dissensions, presents the lengthened echo of that powerful\r\nshock which towards the end of the fifteenth century staggered Europe,\r\nunder so many different forms, it is not the less to the ideas and\r\ndiscoveries which produced that blow that we are indebted for the two\r\ncenturies of splendour, order, and peace during which civilization has\r\nreached the point where we find it in the present day.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to follow the march of human nature during these\r\ntwo centuries. That history is so extensive, and composed of so many\r\nrelations, alternately vast and minute, but always important; of so many\r\nevents closely connected, brought about by causes so mixed together, and\r\ncauses in their turn productive of such numerous effects, of so many\r\ndifferent labours, that it is impossible to recapitulate them within a\r\nlimited compass. Never have so many powerful and neighbouring States\r\nexercised upon each other such constant and complicated influence; never\r\nhas their interior structure presented so many ramifications to study;\r\nnever has the human mind advanced at once upon so many different roads;\r\nnever have so many events, actors, and ideas been engaged in such an\r\nextended space, or produced such interesting and instructive results.\r\nPerhaps on some future occasion we may enter into this maze, and look\r\nfor the clew to guide us through it. Called upon, at present, to study\r\nthe first ages of modern history, we shall seek for their cradle in the\r\nforests of Germany, the country of our ancestors; after having drawn a\r\npicture of their manners, as complete as the number of facts which have\r\nreached our knowledge, the actual state of our information, and my\r\nefforts to reach that level will permit, we shall then cast a glance\r\nupon the condition of the Roman Empire at the moment when the barbarians\r\ninvaded it to attempt establishment; after that we shall investigate the\r\nlong struggles which ensued between them and Rome, from their irruption\r\ninto the West and South of Europe, down to the foundation of the\r\nprincipal modern monarchies. This foundation will thus become for us a\r\nresting-point, from whence we shall depart again to follow the course of\r\nthe history of Europe, which is in fact our own; for if unity, the fruit\r\nof the Roman dominion, disappeared with it, there are always,\r\nnevertheless, between the different nations which rose upon its ruins,\r\nrelations so multiplied, so continued, and so important, that from them,\r\nin the whole of modern history taken together, an actual unity results\r\nwhich we shall be compelled to acknowledge. This task is enormous; and\r\nwhen we contemplate its full extent, it is impossible not to recoil\r\nbefore the difficulty. Judge then, gentlemen, whether I ought not to\r\ntremble at such an undertaking; but your indulgence and zeal will make\r\nup for the weakness of my resources: I shall be more than repaid if I am\r\nable to assist you in advancing even a few steps on the road which leads\r\nto truth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ABBE DE MONTESQUIOU TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_March 31st, 1815._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not, my dear Sir, so lost to my friends that I have forgotten their\r\nfriendship: yours has had many charms for me. I do not reproach myself\r\nwith the poor trick I have played you. Your age does not run a long\r\nlease with mine. We can only show the public the objects worthy of their\r\nconfidence; and I congratulate myself with having left them an\r\nimpression of you which will not readily be effaced. I have been less\r\nfortunate on my own account, and can only deplore that fatality which\r\nhas triumphed over my convictions, my repugnances, and the immeasurable\r\nconsolations which friendship has bestowed on me. Let my example be\r\nprofitable to you on some future occasion. Give to public affairs the\r\nperiod of your strength, but not that which requires repose alone; the\r\ninterval will be long enough, at your time of life, to enable you to\r\narrive at much distinction. I shall enjoy it with the interest which you\r\nknow I feel, and with all the warm feelings with which your attachment\r\nhas inspired me. Present my respects to Madame Guizot; it is to her I\r\noffer my apologies for having disturbed her tranquillity. But I hope her\r\ninfant will profit by the strong food we have already administered to\r\nit. Allow me to request some token of remembrance from her as well as\r\nfrom yourself, for all the sentiments of respect and friendship I have\r\nvowed to you for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABBE DE MONTESQUIOU TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n_Plaisance, June 8th, 1816._\r\n\r\nI was expecting to hear from you, my dear friend, with much impatience,\r\nand I now thank you sincerely for having written to me. It was not that\r\nI doubted your philosophy; you know that those who precede their age\r\nlearn too soon the uncertainty of all human affairs; but I feared lest\r\nyour taste for your early avocations might induce you to abandon public\r\naffairs, for which you have evinced such ready ability; and we are not\r\nrich enough to make sacrifices. I feel very happy at being satisfied on\r\nthis point, and leave the rest to the caprices of that destiny which can\r\nscarcely be harsh towards you. You will be distinguished at the Council,\r\nas you have been in all other situations; and it must naturally follow,\r\nthat the better you are known, your career will become the more\r\nbrilliant and secure. Youth, which feels its power, ought always to say,\r\nwith the Cardinal de Bernis, \"My Lord, I shall wait.\" The more I see of\r\nFrance, the more I am impressed with the truth, that those who believe\r\nthey have secured the State by compromising the royal authority in these\r\ndistant departments, have committed a mistake. All that are honest and\r\nrational are royalists; but, thanks to our own dissensions, they no\r\nlonger know how to show themselves such. They thought until then, that\r\nto serve the King was to do what he required through the voice of his\r\nministers, and they have been lately told that this was an error, but\r\nthey have been left in ignorance as to who are his Majesty's real\r\norgans. The enemies to our repose profit by this. The most absurd\r\nstories are propagated amongst the people, and all are the people at so\r\ngreat a distance. I can imagine that the character of these disturbers\r\nvaries in our different provinces. In this, where we have no large\r\ntowns, and no aristocracy, we lie at the mercy of all who pretend to\r\nknow more than ourselves. Great credit thus attaches to the Half-pays,\r\nwho, belonging more to the people than to any other class, and not being\r\nable to digest their last disappointment, trade upon it in every\r\npossible manner, and are always believed because they are the richest in\r\ntheir immediate locality. The gentlemen Deputies come next upon the\r\nlist, estimating themselves as little proconsuls, disposing of all\r\nplaces, and setting aside prefects. Thus you see how little authority\r\nremains with the King, whose agents are masters and do nothing in his\r\nname. As to the administration of justice, you may readily suppose that\r\nno one thinks of it. The people are in want of bread; their harvest rots\r\nunder continual rains; the roads are horrible, the hospitals in the\r\ngreatest misery; nothing remains but dismissals, accusations, and\r\ndeputations. If you could change them for a little royal authority, we\r\nmight still see the end of our sufferings; but make haste, for when the\r\nmonth of October has arrived it will be too late.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend, present my respects to Madame Guizot, and receive\r\nthe fullest assurance of my good wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\n_Fragments selected from a Pamphlet by_ M. GUIZOT, _entitled 'Thoughts\r\nupon the Liberty of the Press,' 1814._\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the calamities of France, calamities which might be indefinitely\r\nprolonged if they were not attacked at their source, arise, as I have\r\njust said, from the ignorance to which the French people have been\r\ncondemned as to the affairs and position of the State, to the system of\r\nfalsehood adopted by a Government which required everything to be\r\nconcealed, and to the indifference and suspicion with which this\r\nhabitual deceit and falsehood had inspired the citizens. It is truth,\r\ntherefore, which ought to appear in broad daylight; it is obscurity\r\nwhich ought to be dissipated, if we wish to re-establish confidence and\r\nrevive zeal. It will not suffice that the intentions of Government\r\nshould be good, or its words sincere; it is requisite that the people\r\nshould be convinced of this, and should be supplied with the means of\r\nsatisfying themselves. When we have been for a long time tricked by an\r\nimpostor, we become doubtful even of an honest man; and all our proverbs\r\non the melancholy suspicion of old age are founded on this truth ...\r\n\r\nThe nation, so long deceived, expects the truth from every quarter; at\r\npresent, it has a hope of accomplishing this object. It demands it with\r\nanxiety from its representatives, its administrators, and from all who\r\nare believed capable of imparting it. The more it has been withheld up\r\nto this period, the more precious it will be considered. There will be\r\nthis advantage, that it will be hailed with transport by the people as\r\nsoon as they satisfy themselves that it may be trusted; and there will\r\nbe a corresponding evil,--they will listen to it without fear, when they\r\ndiscover that they are left in freedom to deliver their opinions, and to\r\nlabour openly in its support. No one questions the embarrassments which\r\ntruth will dissipate, or the references it will supply. A nation from\r\nwhom it has been sedulously withheld, soon believes that something\r\nhostile is in agitation, and recoils back into mistrust. But when the\r\ntruth is openly manifested, when a Government displays a noble\r\nconfidence in its own sentiments and in the good feeling of its\r\nsubjects, this confidence excites theirs in return, and calls up all\r\ntheir zeal.... The French, certain to understand, and quick to utter\r\ntruth, will soon abandon that injurious tendency to suspicion which\r\nleads them from all esteem for their head, and all devotion to the\r\nState. The most indifferent spirits will resume an interest in public\r\naffairs, when they discover that they can take a part in them; the most\r\napprehensive will cease their fears when they cease to live in clouds;\r\nthey will no longer be continually occupied in calculating how much they\r\nshould reject out of the speeches that are addressed to them, the\r\nrecitals delivered and the portions presented for investigation; or how\r\nmuch artifice, dangerous intention, or afterthought remains hidden in\r\nall that proceeds from the throne.... An extended liberty of the press\r\ncan alone, while restoring confidence, give back that energy to the King\r\nand the people which neither can dispense with: it is the life of the\r\nsoul that requires to be revived in the nation in which it has been\r\nextinguished by despotism; that life lies in the free action of the\r\npress, and thought can only expand and develope itself in full\r\npublicity. No one in France can longer dread the oppression under which\r\nwe have lived for ten years; but if the want of action which weakness\r\nengenders were to succeed that which tyranny imposes;--if the weight of\r\na terrible and mute agitation should be replaced only by the languor of\r\nrepose, we should never witness a renewal in France of that national\r\nactivity, that brave and generous disposition which makes many\r\nsacrifices to duty;--finally, of that confidence in the sovereign, the\r\nnecessity of which will be more acknowledged every day. We should merely\r\nobtain from the nation a barren tranquillity, the insufficiency of which\r\nwould compel recourse to measures evil in themselves, and very far\r\nremoved from the paternal intentions of the King.\r\n\r\nLet us, on the contrary, adopt a system of liberty and frankness; let\r\ntruth circulate freely from the throne to the people, and from the\r\npeople to the throne; let the paths be opened to those who ought to\r\nspeak freely, and to others who desire to learn; we shall then see\r\napathy dissipate, suspicion vanish, and loyalty become general and\r\nspontaneous, from the certainty of its necessity and usefulness.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, during the twenty-five years which have recently elapsed,\r\nwe have so deplorably abused many advantages, that, at present, to name\r\nthem suffices to excite the most deplorable apprehensions. We are not\r\ninclined to take into consideration the difference of the times, of\r\nsituation, of the march of opinion, or of the temperament of men's\r\nminds: we look upon as always dangerous what has once proved fatal; we\r\nthink and act as mothers might do, who, because they saw the infant\r\nfall, would prevent the youth from walking.... This inclination is\r\ngeneral; we retrace it under every form; and those who have closely\r\nobserved it will have little trouble in satisfying themselves that\r\nperfect liberty of the press, at least with regard to political\r\nquestions, would, in the present day, be almost without danger. Those\r\nwho fear it fancy themselves still at the beginning of the\r\nRevolution--at that epoch when all passions sought only to display\r\nthemselves, when violence was the popular characteristic, and reason\r\nobtained only a contemptuous smile. Nothing can be more dissimilar than\r\nthat time and the present; and, from the very cause that unlicensed\r\nfreedom then gave rise to the most disastrous evils, we may infer,\r\nunless I deceive myself, that very few would now spring from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as many people appear to dread such a result; as I am\r\nunwilling to affirm that the experiment might not be followed by certain\r\ninconveniences, more mischievous from the fear they would inspire than\r\nfrom the actual consequences they might introduce;--as in the state in\r\nwhich we find ourselves, without a guide in the experience of the past,\r\nor certain data for the future, it is natural that we should advance\r\ncautiously; and as the spirit of the nation seems to indicate that in\r\nevery respect circumspection is necessary, the opinions of those who\r\nthink that some restrictions should be imposed, ought, perhaps, to\r\nprevail. For twenty-five years the nation has been so utterly a stranger\r\nto habits of true liberty, it has passed through so many different forms\r\nof despotism, and the last was felt to be so oppressive, that, in\r\nrestoring freedom, we may dread inexperience more than impetuosity; it\r\nwould not dream of attack, but it might prove unequal to defence; in the\r\nmidst of the necessity for order and peace which is universally felt, in\r\nthe midst of a collision of opposing interests which must be carefully\r\ndealt with, Government may wish, and with reason, to avoid the\r\nappearance of clashing and disturbance, which might probably be without\r\nimportance, but the danger of which would be exaggerated by imagination.\r\n\r\nThe question then reduces itself to this:--What are, under existing\r\ncircumstances, the causes which call for a certain restraint in the\r\nliberty of the press? and by what restrictions, conformable to the\r\nnature of these causes, can we modify without destroying its freedom?\r\nand how shall we gradually remove these qualifications, for the present\r\nconsidered necessary?\r\n\r\nAll liberty is placed between oppression and license: the liberty of man\r\nin the social state is necessarily restrained by certain laws, the abuse\r\nor oblivion of which are equally dangerous; but the circumstances which\r\nexpose society to either of these perils are different. In a\r\nwell-established government, solidly constituted, the danger against\r\nwhich the friends of liberty have to contend is oppression: all is there\r\ncombined for the maintenance of law; all tends to support vigorous\r\ndiscipline, against which every individual labours to retain the share\r\nof freedom which is his due; the function of government is to support\r\norder; that of the governed to watch over liberty.\r\n\r\nThe state of things is entirely different in a government only\r\ncommencing. If it follows a period of misfortune and disturbance, during\r\nwhich morality and reason have been equally perverted,--when passions\r\nhave been indulged without curb, when private interests have been\r\nparaded without shame,--then oppression falls within the number of\r\ndangers which are only to be anticipated, while license is that which\r\nmust be directly opposed. Our Government has not yet attained its full\r\nstrength; it is not yet possessed of all the means which are to be\r\nplaced at its disposal to maintain order and rule: before acquiring all,\r\nit will be careful not to abuse any; and the governed, who are still\r\nwithout some of the advantages of order, wish to possess all those of\r\nconfusion. They are not yet sufficiently sure of their own tranquillity,\r\nto abstain from attacking that of others. Every one is ready to inflict\r\nthe blow he is exposed to receive; we offend with impunity the laws\r\nwhich have not yet foreseen all the methods that may be adopted to elude\r\nthem; we brave without danger the authorities which cannot yet appeal,\r\nin their own support, to the experience of the happiness enjoyed under\r\ntheir auspices. It is, then, against particular attempts that constant\r\nwatch should be kept; thus it becomes necessary to protect liberty from\r\nthe outrages of license, and sometimes to prevent a strong government\r\nfrom being reduced to defence when uncertain of commanding obedience.\r\n\r\nThus, unrestricted liberty of the press, without detrimental\r\nconsequences in a state of government free, happy, and strongly\r\nconstituted, might prove injurious under a system only commencing, and\r\nin which the citizens have still to acquire liberty and prosperity. In\r\nthe first case there is no danger in allowing freedom of thought and\r\nutterance to all, because, if the order of things is good, the great\r\nmajority of the members of society will be disposed to support it, and\r\nalso because the nation, enlightened by its actual happiness, will not\r\nbe easily drawn to the pursuit of something always represented as\r\nbetter, but ever uncertain of acquirement. In the second case, on the\r\ncontrary, the passions and interests of many individuals, differing in\r\nthemselves, and all, more or less, abstracted from any feeling for the\r\npublic good, are neither instructed by prosperity nor enlightened by\r\nexperience; there exist therefore in the nation very few barriers\r\nagainst the plotters of evil, while in the government there are many\r\ngaps through which disorder may introduce itself: every species of\r\nambition revives, and none can tell on what point to settle; all seek\r\ntheir place, without being sure of finding it; common sense, which\r\ninvents nothing, but knows how to select, has no fixed rule upon which\r\nto act; the bewildered multitude, who are directed by nothing and have\r\nnot yet learned to direct themselves, know not what guide to follow; and\r\nin the midst of so many contradictory ideas, and incapable of separating\r\ntruth from falsehood, the least evil that can happen is, that they may\r\ndetermine to remain in their ignorance and stupidity. While information\r\nis still so sparingly disseminated, the license of the press becomes an\r\nimportant obstacle to its progress; men, little accustomed to reason\r\nupon certain matters, and poor in positive knowledge, adopt too readily\r\nthe errors which are propagated from every quarter, and find it\r\ndifficult to distinguish readily the truth when presented to them;\r\nthence originate a host of false and crude notions, a multiplicity of\r\njudgments adopted without examination, and a pretended acquirement, the\r\nmore mischievous as, occupying the place which reason alone should hold,\r\nit for a long time interdicts her approach.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution has proved to us the danger arising from knowledge so\r\nerroneously obtained. From this danger we are now called on to protect\r\nourselves. It is better to confess the fact: we have learned wisdom from\r\nmisfortune; but the despotism of the last ten years has extinguished,\r\nfor the greater part of the French people, the light we might thence\r\nhave derived. Some individuals, undoubtedly, have continued to reflect,\r\nto observe, and to study--they have been instructed by the very\r\ndespotism which oppressed them; but the nation in general, crushed and\r\nunfortunate, has found itself arrested in the development of its\r\nintellectual faculties. When we look closely into the fact, we feel\r\nsurprised and almost ashamed of our national thoughtlessness and\r\nignorance; we feel the necessity of emerging from it. The most\r\noppressive yoke alone was able to reduce, and could again reduce it for\r\na certain time to silence and inaction; but it requires to be propped\r\nand guided, and, after so much experimental imprudence, for the interest\r\neven of reason and knowledge, the liberty of the press, which we have\r\nnever yet enjoyed, ought to be attempted with caution.\r\n\r\nRegarded in this point of view, the restrictions which may be applied\r\nwill less startle the friends of truth and justice; they will see in\r\nthem nothing more than a concession to existing circumstances, dictated\r\nsolely by the interest of the nation; and if care is taken to limit this\r\nconcession so that it may never become dangerous; if, in establishing a\r\nbarrier against license, a door is always left open for liberty; if the\r\nobject of these restrictions is evidently to prepare the French people\r\nto dispense with them, and to arrive hereafter at perfect freedom; if\r\nthey are so combined and modified that the liberty may go on\r\nincreasing until the nation becomes more capable of enjoying it\r\nprofitably;--finally, if, instead of impeding the progress of the human\r\nmind, they are only calculated to assure it, and to direct the course of\r\nthe most enlightened spirits;--so far from considering them as an attack\r\nupon the principles of justice, we shall see in them a measure of\r\nprudence, a guarantee for public order, and a new motive for hoping that\r\nthe overthrow of that order will never again occur to disturb or retard\r\nthe French nation in the career of truth and reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\n_Report to the King, and Royal Decree for the Reform of Public\r\nInstruction, February 17th, 1815._\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis, by the grace of God, King of France and Navarre, to all who may\r\nreceive these presents, they come greeting.\r\n\r\nHaving had an account delivered to us, of the state of public\r\ninstruction in our kingdom, we have observed that it rested upon\r\ninstitutions destined to advance the political views of the Government\r\nwhich had formed them, rather than to extend to our subjects the\r\nadvantages of moral education, conformable with the necessities of the\r\nage. We have rendered justice to the wisdom and zeal of all who were\r\nappointed to watch over and direct instruction. We have seen with\r\nsatisfaction that they have never ceased to struggle against the\r\nobstacles which the times opposed to them, and also to the institutions\r\nwhich they were called to put in force. But we have felt the necessity\r\nof reforming these institutions, and of bringing back national education\r\nto its true object; which is, to disseminate sound doctrines, to\r\nmaintain good manners, and to train men who, by their knowledge and\r\nvirtue, may communicate to society the profitable lessons and wise\r\nexamples they have received from their masters.\r\n\r\nWe have maturely considered these institutions, which we now propose to\r\nreform; and it appears to us that a system of single and absolute\r\nauthority is incompatible with our paternal intentions and with the\r\nliberal spirit of our government;\r\n\r\nThat this authority, essentially occupied in the direction of the whole,\r\nwas to a certain extent condemned to be in ignorance or neglectful of\r\nthose details of daily examination, which can only be intrusted to local\r\nsupervisors better informed as to the necessities, and more directly\r\ninterested in the prosperity of the establishments committed to their\r\ncharge;\r\n\r\nThat the right of nomination to all these situations, concentrated in\r\nthe hands of a single person, left too much opening for error, and too\r\nmuch influence to favour, weakening the impulse of emulation, and\r\nreducing the teachers to a state of dependence ill suited to the\r\nhonourable post they occupied, and to the importance of their functions;\r\n\r\nThat this dependence and the too frequent removals which are the\r\ninevitable result, rendered the position of the teachers uncertain and\r\nprecarious; was injurious to the consideration they ought to enjoy to\r\ninduce them to work zealously in their laborious vocations; and\r\nprevented, between them and the relations of their pupils, that\r\nconfidence which results from long service and old habits; and thus\r\ndeprived them of the most gratifying reward they could attain--the\r\nrespect and affection of the countries to which they have dedicated\r\ntheir talents and their lives;\r\n\r\nFinally, that the tax of one-twentieth of the costs of instruction,\r\nlevied upon all the pupils of the lyceums, colleges, and schools, and\r\napplied to expenses from which those who pay it derive no immediate\r\nadvantage, and which charges may be considerably reduced, are in\r\nopposition to our desire of favouring good and profitable studies, and\r\nof extending the benefits of education to all classes of our subjects.\r\n\r\nWishing to enable ourselves, as soon as possible, to lay before the two\r\nChambers the bills which are intended to establish the system of public\r\ninstruction throughout France, and to provide for the necessary\r\nexpenses, we have resolved to establish provisionally the reforms best\r\nadapted to supply the experience and information which we still require,\r\nto accomplish this object; and in place of the tax of one-twentieth on\r\nthe costs of instruction, the abolition of which we are not inclined to\r\ndefer, it has pleased us to appropriate, from our Civil List, the sum of\r\none million, which will be employed during the present year, 1815, for\r\nthe use of public instruction in this our kingdom.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, and on the report of our Minister the Secretary of\r\nState for the Department of the Interior, and by and with the advice of\r\nour Council of State, we have decreed, and do decree, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE I.\r\n\r\n_General Arrangements._\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The divisions arranged under the name of _Academies_ by the\r\ndecree of the 17th of May, 1808, are reduced to seventeen, conformably\r\nto the table at present annexed. They will assume the title of\r\n_Universities_.\r\n\r\nThe Universities will be named after the Head Town assigned to each.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceums at present established will be called _Royal Colleges_.\r\n\r\n2. Each University will be composed, first, of a council, presided over\r\nby a rector; secondly, of faculties; thirdly, of colleges; fourthly, of\r\ndistrict colleges.\r\n\r\n3. The mode of teaching and discipline in all the Universities will be\r\nregulated and superintended by a Royal Council of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n4. The Normal School of Paris will be common to all the Universities; it\r\nwill provide, at the expense of the State, the number of professors and\r\nmasters which may be required to give instruction in science and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE II.\r\n\r\n_Respecting the Universities._\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1.\r\n\r\n_The Councils of the Universities._\r\n\r\n5. The Council of each University will consist of a presiding rector, of\r\nthe deans of faculty, of the provost of the royal college of the Head\r\nTown, or of the oldest provost if there are more than one royal college;\r\nand of at least three of the principal inhabitants, selected by our\r\nRoyal Council of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n6. The bishop and prefect will be members of this council, and will have\r\nvotes in the meetings, above the rector.\r\n\r\n7. The council of the University can visit, whenever they consider it\r\nproper to do so, the royal and district colleges, the institutes,\r\nboarding-schools, and other seminaries of instruction, through two\r\nappointed inspectors; who will report on the state of teaching and\r\ndiscipline within the jurisdiction of the University, according to the\r\ninstructions delivered to them.\r\n\r\nThe number of inspectors for the University of Paris may amount to six.\r\n\r\n8. The council will select each of these inspectors from two candidates\r\nrecommended by the rector.\r\n\r\n9. The council will also select, each from two candidates recommended by\r\nthe rector, the provosts, the censors or inspectors of studies, the\r\nprofessors of philosophy, rhetoric, and higher mathematics, the\r\nchaplains, and bursars of the royal colleges.\r\n\r\n10. The inspectors of the Universities will be selected from the\r\nprovosts, the superintendent-masters, the professors of philosophy,\r\nrhetoric, and mathematics of the royal colleges, and from the head\r\nmasters of the district colleges; the superintendent-masters in the\r\nroyal colleges will be chosen from the professors of philosophy,\r\nrhetoric, or superior mathematics in the same colleges.\r\n\r\n11. The council of the University can revoke, if they see cause, any\r\nappointment they may make: in these cases their resolutions must be\r\nnotified and accounted for, and cannot take effect until sanctioned by\r\nour Royal Council of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n12. No one can establish an institution or a boarding-school, or become\r\nhead of an institution or a boarding-school already established,\r\nwithout having been previously examined and duly qualified by the\r\ncouncil of the University, and unless their qualification has been\r\napproved of by the Royal Council of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n13. The council of the University will examine and decide on the\r\naccounts of the faculties, and of the royal colleges; they will also\r\nexamine the accounts of general expenditure handed in by the rector,\r\nand, after having decided on them, will transmit the same to our Royal\r\nCouncil of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n14. The council will keep a registry of its proceedings, and will\r\nforward a copy once a month to our Royal Council.\r\n\r\n15. In public ceremonies, the council will rank after the Council of\r\nPrefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2.\r\n\r\n_Of the Rectors of Universities._\r\n\r\n16. The rectors of the Universities are appointed by us, each selected\r\nfrom three candidates presented by our Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction, and chosen from rectors already appointed, from\r\ninspectors-general of study, of whom we shall speak hereafter, from the\r\nprofessors of faculty, the professors of the Universities, the provosts,\r\nthe censors, and the professors of philosophy, rhetoric, and superior\r\nmathematics in the royal colleges.\r\n\r\n17. The rectors of the Universities appoint the professors, doctors of\r\nfaculty, and masters in all the colleges, with the exception of the\r\nprofessors of philosophy, rhetoric, and superior mathematics in the\r\nroyal colleges, who are appointed as already named in Article 9.\r\n\r\n18. The rectors will select the candidates from amongst the professors,\r\ndoctors of faculty, and masters already employed in the old or new\r\nestablishments of education, or from the pupils of the Normal School,\r\nwho, having completed their courses, have received the degree of\r\nProfessor-Substitute.\r\n\r\n19. The professors and doctors of faculty thus appointed can only be\r\nremoved by the council of the University upon the explained proposition\r\nof the rector.\r\n\r\n20. The professors and doctors of faculty, appointed by one or more\r\nrectors, not being those of the Universities in which they are actually\r\nemployed, can choose the University and select the employment they may\r\nprefer; but they are bound to notify their decision, one month before\r\nthe commencement of the scholastic year, to the rector of the University\r\nto which they belong.\r\n\r\n21. The pupils of the Normal School selected by rectors not belonging to\r\nthe University from whence they were sent, have the same privilege of\r\noption, on giving similar notice.\r\n\r\n22. The rector of the University will preside, whenever he thinks\r\nproper, at the examinations which precede the conferring of degrees in\r\nthe different faculties.\r\n\r\n23. The rector has the entire charge of correspondence.\r\n\r\n24. He will lay before the council of the University all matters that\r\nrequire to be submitted to them, appoint the reporters, if necessary,\r\nregulate the order of discussion, and sign the resolutions.\r\n\r\n25. If opinions are equally divided, he has the casting vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.\r\n\r\n_Of the Faculties._\r\n\r\n26. The number and composition of the Faculties in each University are\r\nsettled by us, on the proposition of our Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction.\r\n\r\n27. The faculties are placed immediately under the authority, direction,\r\nand supervision of that Council.\r\n\r\n28. The Council appoints their deans, each from two candidates, who will\r\nbe nominated for selection.\r\n\r\n29. It appoints the professors for life, each from four candidates, two\r\nof whom must be presented by the faculty in which a chair has become\r\nvacant, and the other two by the council of the University.\r\n\r\n30. Over and above the special teaching with which they are charged, the\r\nfaculties will confer, after examination, and according to the\r\nestablished rules, the degrees which are or may become necessary for the\r\nvarious ecclesiastical, political, and civil functions and professions.\r\n\r\n31. The diplomas of degrees are issued in our name, signed by the dean,\r\nand countersigned by the rector, who can refuse his _visa_ if he has\r\nreason to think that the prescribed conditions have not been correctly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n32. In the Universities which as yet have no faculties of science or\r\nliterature, the degree of Bachelor in Letters may be conferred after the\r\nprescribed examinations by the provost, the inspector of studies, and\r\nthe professors of philosophy and rhetoric of the royal college of the\r\nHead Town of the district. The inspector of studies will perform the\r\nfunctions of dean; he will sign the diplomas, and will take his place in\r\nthe sittings of the councils of the University, after the provost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.\r\n\r\n_Of the Royal and District Colleges._\r\n\r\n33. The Royal Colleges are governed by a provost, and the District\r\nColleges by a principal.\r\n\r\n34. The provosts and principals will execute and cause to be executed\r\nthe regulations regarding instruction, discipline, and compatibility.\r\n\r\n35. The administration of the royal college of the Head Town is placed\r\nunder the immediate superintendence of the rector and the council of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n36. All the other colleges, royal or provincial, are placed under the\r\nimmediate superintendence of a committee of administration composed of\r\nthe sub-prefect, the mayor, and at least three of the principal\r\ninhabitants of the place, appointed by the council of the University.\r\n\r\n37. This committee will propose, in each case, two candidates to the\r\nrector, who will select from them the principals of the local colleges.\r\n\r\n38. The principals, thus appointed, can only be removed by the council\r\nof the University, upon the proposition of the committee, and by the\r\ndecision of the rector.\r\n\r\n39. The Committee of Administration will examine and decide on the\r\naccounts of the local colleges.\r\n\r\n40. The Committee will also examine and decide on the accounts of the\r\nroyal colleges, except only on those of the royal college of the Head\r\nTown, and will transmit them to the council of the University.\r\n\r\n41. The Committee will also keep a register of its proceedings, and\r\ntransmit the same once in every month to the council of the University.\r\n\r\n42. The president of this Committee will be the sub-prefect, or, in his\r\nabsence, the mayor.\r\n\r\n43. The bishops and prefects are members of all the Committees in their\r\ndiocese or department; and when present they will have votes above the\r\npresidents.\r\n\r\n44. The heads of institutions and masters of boarding-schools\r\nestablished within the boundaries of cities or towns in which there are\r\neither royal or local colleges, are required to send their boarders as\r\nday-scholars to the classes of the said colleges.\r\n\r\n45. The second Ecclesiastical School which has been or may be\r\nestablished in each department, in virtue of our decree of ..., is\r\nexcepted from this obligation: but the said school cannot receive\r\nday-scholars of any description.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Normal School._\r\n\r\n46. Each University will send, every year, to the Normal School at\r\nParis, a number of pupils proportioned to the necessities of education.\r\n\r\nThis number will be regulated by our Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction.\r\n\r\n47. The council of the University will select these pupils from those\r\nwho, having finished their courses in rhetoric and philosophy, are\r\nintended, with the consent of their relatives, for public teachers.\r\n\r\n48. The pupils sent to the Normal School will remain there three years,\r\nafter which they will be examined by our Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction, who will deliver to them, on approbation, the brevet of\r\nProfessor-Substitute.\r\n\r\n49. The pupils who have received this brevet, if not summoned by the\r\nrector of other Universities, will return to that to which they\r\noriginally belonged, where they will be placed by the rector, and\r\nadvanced according to their capacity and services.\r\n\r\n50. The head master of the Normal School will hold the same rank, and\r\nexercise the same prerogatives, with the rectors of the Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Royal Council of Public Instruction._\r\n\r\n51. Our Royal Council of Public Instruction will be composed of a\r\npresident and eleven councillors appointed by us.\r\n\r\n52. Two of this number will be selected from the clergy, two from our\r\nState Council, or from the Courts, and the seven others from individuals\r\nwho have become eminent for their talents or services in the cause of\r\npublic instruction.\r\n\r\n53. The president of our Royal Council is alone charged with the\r\ncorrespondence; he will introduce all subjects of discussion to the\r\nCouncil, name the reporters, if necessary, establish the order of\r\ndebate, sign and despatch the resolutions, and see them carried into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n54. In case of an equal division of opinions, he will have the casting\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n55. Conformably with Article 3 of the present decree, our Royal Council\r\nwill prepare, arrange, and promulgate the general regulations concerning\r\ninstruction and discipline.\r\n\r\n56. The Council will prescribe the execution of these rules to all the\r\nUniversities, and will watch over them through the Inspectors-General of\r\nStudies, who will visit the Universities whenever directed by the\r\nCouncil to do so, and will report on the state of all the schools.\r\n\r\n57. The number of the Inspectors will be twelve; that is to say, two for\r\nthe faculties of law, two for those of medicine, and the remaining eight\r\nfor the faculties of science and literature and for the royal and local\r\ncolleges.\r\n\r\n58. The Inspectors-General of Studies will be appointed by us, each\r\nbeing selected from three candidates proposed by our Royal Council of\r\nPublic Instruction, and who will have been chosen from amongst the\r\nrectors and inspectors of the Universities, the deans of faculty, the\r\nprovosts, the censors of study, and the professors of philosophy,\r\nrhetoric, and superior mathematics in the royal colleges.\r\n\r\n59. On the report of the Inspectors-General of Studies, our Royal\r\nCouncil will give such instructions to the councils of the Universities\r\nas may appear essential; they will detect abuses, and provide the\r\nnecessary reforms.\r\n\r\n60. The Council will furnish us with an annual account of the state of\r\npublic instruction throughout our kingdom.\r\n\r\n61. It will propose all such measures as may be considered suitable to\r\nadvance instruction, and for which it may be requisite to appeal to our\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n62. It will induce and encourage the production of such books as may\r\nstill be wanting for general purposes of education, and will decide on\r\nthose which are to be preferred.\r\n\r\n63. It will remove, if necessary, the deans of faculty, and will propose\r\nto us the removal of the rectors of Universities.\r\n\r\n64. It will examine and decide on the accounts of the general\r\nadministration of the Universities.\r\n\r\n65. The Normal School is placed under the special authority of the Royal\r\nCouncil; the Council can either appoint or remove the administrators and\r\nmasters of that establishment.\r\n\r\n66. The Council holds the same rank with our Court of Appeal and Court\r\nof Accounts, and will take place, in all public ceremonies, immediately\r\nafter the last-named.\r\n\r\n67. It will keep a registry of all its proceedings, and will deposit a\r\ncopy with our Minister the Secretary of State for the department of the\r\nInterior, who will furnish us with an account of the same, and on whose\r\nreport we shall exercise the right of reforming or annulling them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE V.\r\n\r\n_Of Receipts and Expenses._\r\n\r\n68. The tax of one-twentieth on the expenses of studies, imposed upon\r\nthe pupils of colleges and schools, is abolished from the date of the\r\npublication of the present decree.\r\n\r\n69. Excepting always: 1. The charges for terms, examinations, and\r\ndegrees, applied to the benefit of the faculties; 2. The subscriptions\r\npaid by the pupils of the royal and local colleges for the advantage of\r\nthose establishments; 3. The annual contributions of the heads of\r\nseminaries and boarding-schools, for the use of the Universities.\r\n\r\n70. The townships will continue to supply the funds for scholars on the\r\nfoundation, and the sums they have hitherto contributed under the title\r\nof help to their colleges: with this object, the total of these sums, as\r\nalso of the burses, will be included in their respective budgets with\r\nthe fixed expenses; and no deviation whatever from this will take place,\r\nunless previously submitted to our Royal Council of Instruction.\r\n\r\n71. The townships will also continue to supply and keep in repair the\r\nbuildings requisite for the Universities, the faculties, and colleges.\r\n\r\n72. The councils of the Universities will settle the budgets for the\r\ncolleges and faculties.\r\n\r\n73. The faculties and royal colleges, of which the receipts exceed the\r\nexpenses, will apply the surplus to the treasury of the University.\r\n\r\n74. The councils of the universities will receive the annual\r\ncontributions of the heads of seminaries and boarding schools.\r\n\r\n75. They will manage the property belonging to the University of France\r\nsituated in the district of each provincial university, and will collect\r\nthe revenue.\r\n\r\n76. In case the receipts of the faculties, or those assigned for the\r\nexpenses of general administration, should prove inadequate, the\r\ncouncils of the universities will make a distinct requisition, and will\r\nstate the sums required to replace each deficiency.\r\n\r\n77. This requisition will be addressed to our Royal Council of Public\r\nInstruction, who will transmit it, with suggestions, to our Minister the\r\nSecretary of State for the department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n78. The expenses of the faculties and Universities, as settled by our\r\nMinister the Secretary of State for the department of the Interior, will\r\nbe paid on his order from our Royal Treasury.\r\n\r\n79. There will also be paid from our Royal Treasury, in like manner--1,\r\nthe expenses of our Royal Council of Public Instruction; 2, those of the\r\nNormal School; 3, the Royal donations.\r\n\r\n80. For these purposes the annual income of 400,000 francs, forming the\r\nappanage of the University of France, is placed at the disposal of our\r\nMinister the Secretary of State for the department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n81. Further, and in provisional replacement of the tax abolished by Art.\r\n68 of this present Decree, our Minister the Secretary of State for the\r\ndepartment of the Interior, is authorized by us for the promotion of\r\npublic instruction in our kingdom, during the year 1815, to apply to the\r\nMinister of our Household, who will place at his disposal the sum of one\r\nmillion, to be deducted from the funds of our Civil List.\r\n\r\n82. The funds proceeding from the reduction of one twenty-fifth of the\r\nappointments in the University of France, will be applied to retiring\r\npensions; our Royal Council is charged to propose to us the most\r\neligible mode of appropriating this fund, and also to suggest the means\r\nof securing a new one for the same purpose, in all the universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VI.\r\n\r\n_Temporary Arrangements._\r\n\r\n83. The members of our Royal Council of Public Instruction, who are to\r\nbe selected in conformity with Art. 52, the inspectors-general of\r\nstudies, the rectors and inspectors of universities, will be appointed\r\nby us, in the first instance, from amongst all those who have been or\r\nare now actually employed in the different educational establishments.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of eligibility settled by that Article, as also by\r\nArticles 10, 16, and 58, apply to situations which may hereafter become\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\n84. The members of suppressed universities and societies, who have taken\r\ndegrees as professors in the old faculties, or who have filled the posts\r\nof superiors and principals of colleges, or chairs of philosophy or\r\nrhetoric, as also councillors, inspectors-general, rectors and\r\ninspectors of academies, and professors of faculties in the University\r\nof France, who may find themselves out of employment by the effect of\r\nthe present decree, are eligible to all places whatever.\r\n\r\n85. The fixed salaries of the deans and professors of faculties, and\r\nthose of the provosts, inspectors of studies, and professors in the\r\nRoyal colleges are not to be altered.\r\n\r\n86. The deans and professors of the faculties that will be continued,\r\nthe provosts and doctors of faculty of the district colleges at present\r\nin office, are to retain the same rights and privileges, and will be\r\nsubject to the same regulations of repeal, as if they had been appointed\r\nin pursuance of the present decree.\r\n\r\nWe hereby inform and command our courts, tribunals, prefects, and\r\nadministrative bodies to publish and register these presents wherever\r\nthey may deem it necessary to do so. Moreover we direct our\r\nattorneys-general and prefects to see that this is done, and to certify\r\nthe same; that is to say, the courts and tribunals to our Chancellor,\r\nand the prefects to our Minister the Secretary of State for the\r\ndepartment of the Interior.\r\n\r\nGiven at Paris, in our Castle of the Tuileries, February 17, in the year\r\nof grace 1815, and in the twentieth of our reign.\r\n\r\n   (Signed)  LOUIS.\r\n\r\nBy the King; the Minister Secretary of State for the Interior.\r\n\r\n   (Signed)  THE ABBE DE MONTESQUIOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\n_Note drawn up and laid before the King and Council in August 1816, on\r\nthe question of dissolving the Chamber of 1815; by M. Laine, Minister of\r\nthe Interior._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt being considered probable that the King may be obliged to dissolve\r\nthe Chamber after its assembly, let us consider what will be the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nDissolution during the session is an extreme measure. It is a sort of\r\nappeal made in the midst of passions in full conflict. The causes which\r\nlead to it, the feelings of resentment to which it will give rise, will\r\nspread throughout France.\r\n\r\nThe convocation of a new Chamber will require much time, and will render\r\nit almost impossible to introduce a budget this year. To hold back the\r\nbudget until the first month of the year ensuing, is to run the risk of\r\nseeing the deficit increase and the available resources disappear.\r\n\r\nThis would in all probability render us incapable of paying the\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nAfter such an unusual dissolution, justified by the danger which the\r\nChamber may threaten, it is difficult to suppose that the electoral\r\nassemblies would be tranquil. And if agitation should exhibit itself,\r\nthe return of the foreigners is to be apprehended from that cause. The\r\ndread of this consequence, in either case, will induce the King to\r\nhesitate; and whatever attempts may be made to disturb the public peace\r\nor to assail the Royal authority, his Majesty's heart, in the hope that\r\nsuch evils would be merely transitory, will decide with reluctance on\r\nsuch an extreme remedy as dissolution.\r\n\r\nIf then, the necessity of dissolving the Chamber becomes pressing, will\r\nit not be better, before it meets, to adopt means of preserving us from\r\nthis menacing disaster?\r\n\r\nThe renewal of one-fifth of the members, which, under any circumstances,\r\nseems to me indispensable to carry out the Charter, and which I regret\r\nto say we too much neglected in the month of July 1815, will scarcely\r\ndiminish the probable necessity of dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe members returned for the fourth series are, with a few exceptions,\r\nmoderate; they have no disposition whatever to disturb public repose, or\r\ninterfere with the Royal prerogative, which alone can maintain order by\r\ngiving confidence to all classes. The other four-fifths remain\r\nunchanged; the apprehended dangers are consequently as imminent.\r\n\r\nThis consideration induces me to recommend the adoption of a measure\r\nwhich might facilitate a complete return to the Charter, by recalling\r\nthe decree of the 13th of July, which infringed it in the articles of\r\nage and number, and has also reduced to problems many more of its\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThis measure would be to summon, by royal letters, only such deputies as\r\nhave reached the age of forty, and according to the number stipulated in\r\nthe Charter.\r\n\r\nTo effect this, we should choose the deputies who have been first named\r\nin each electoral college. We should thus pay a compliment to the\r\nelectors by summoning those who appear to hold the most distinguished\r\nplaces in their confidence.\r\n\r\nIt is true it will be said that the Chamber not being dissolved, the\r\npresent deputies have a kind of legal possession.\r\n\r\nBut the electors and the deputies they have chosen, only hold their\r\npower from the Decree.\r\n\r\nThe same authority which conferred that power can recall it by revoking\r\nthe Decree.\r\n\r\nThe King in his opening speech appeared to say that it was only owing to\r\nan extraordinary circumstance that he had assembled round the throne a\r\ngreater number of deputies. That extraordinary circumstance has passed\r\naway. Peace is made, order is re-established, the Allies have retired\r\nfrom the heart of France and from the Capital.\r\n\r\nThis idea furnishes an answer to the objection that the operations of\r\nthe Chamber are nullified.\r\n\r\nThe King had the power of making it what it is, in consequence of\r\nexisting circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Deputies does not alone make the laws. The Chamber of\r\nPeers, and the King, who in France is the chief branch of the\r\nlegislative body, have co-operated in that enactment.\r\n\r\nIf this objection could hold good in the present case, it would equally\r\nhold good in all the rest. In fact, either after the dissolution, or\r\nunder any other circumstances, the King will return to the Charter, in\r\nregard to age and number. On this hypothesis, it might be said that the\r\noperations of the existing Chamber are nullified. Article 14 of the\r\nCharter could always be explained by the extraordinary circumstances,\r\nand its complete re-establishment by the most sacred motives. To return\r\nto the Charter without dissolution is not then to nullify the operations\r\nof the Chamber more than to return to the Charter after dissolution.\r\n\r\nWill it be said that the King is not more certain of a majority after\r\nthe proposed reduction than at present? I reply that the probability is\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nAn assembly less numerous will be more easily managed; reason will be\r\nmore readily attended to. The Royal authority which is exercised in the\r\nreduction will be increased and secured.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the event of a dissolution, would the King be more certain of\r\na majority? How many chances are against this! On one side the ultras,\r\nwhose objection to transfer a portion of the Royal authority to what\r\nthey call the aristocracy, occupy nearly all the posts which influence\r\nthe operations of the electoral assemblies. On the other, they will be\r\nvehemently opposed by the partisans of a popular liberty not less\r\nhostile to the Kingly power. The struggles which will take place at the\r\nelectoral assemblies, will be repeated in the Chamber, and what\r\ndescription of majority will emanate from such a contest?\r\n\r\nIf the plan of reduction appears inadmissible;--if on the other hand, it\r\nshould be decided that the hostile spirit of the Chamber compels the\r\ndissolution after convocation;--I should not hesitate to prefer\r\nimmediate dissolution to the danger which seems so likely to arise from\r\ndissolution after assembly.\r\n\r\nBut if immediate dissolution were to lead to the forming of a new\r\nChamber animated by the same spirit and views, it would then become\r\nnecessary to find remedies, to preserve the Royal authority, and to save\r\nFrance from the presence of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe first method would be to sacrifice the Ministers, who are ready to\r\nlay down their places and their lives to preserve the King and France.\r\n\r\nThe above notes are exclusively founded on the probable necessity of\r\ndissolution after the Chamber is convoked.\r\n\r\nThis measure will become necessary if, under the pretext of amendments,\r\nthe King's wishes are trifled with; if the budget should be thrown out,\r\nor too long delayed; or if the amendments or propositions are of a\r\nnature to alarm the country, and in consequence to call in the\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe customs adopted during the last session, the bills announced, the\r\nacrimony exhibited, the evidences we have thence derived, the hostility\r\nalready prepared by ambitious disturbers, the determination evinced to\r\nweaken the Kingly authority by declaiming against the modified\r\ncentralization of government, all supply powerful reasons for expecting\r\nthe probable occurrences which will necessitate the dissolution of the\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\nTaking another view, it ought not to be easily believed that a few\r\nmisguided Frenchmen, compromising the fortune of their country by\r\ncontinuing to oppose the Royal authority, may go the length of exposing\r\nthemselves to the double scourge of foreign invasion and civil war, or\r\nthat they be content with the loss of certain provinces through\r\nimprudent propositions, legally unjust, or....\r\n\r\nAre we permitted to hope that in presenting such bills as religion and\r\ndevotion to the King and the country may inspire us to frame, these\r\nbills will not be rejected?\r\n\r\nShall we be enabled to draw up these bills in such a manner as to\r\nconvince the Session and the world that malevolent opposition alone can\r\ndefeat them?\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great probabilities that the dissolution may become\r\nnecessary, the danger would be less formidable, if the King, at the\r\nopening of the session, were to express his wishes energetically; if he\r\nwere to issue previous decrees, revoking all that has not been yet\r\ncarried out in the Decrees of July 1815; if, above all, after having\r\ndeclared his will by solemn acts, his Majesty would firmly repeat those\r\nacts in the the immediate vicinity of the throne, by removing from his\r\nperson all those who might be inclined to misrepresent or oppose his\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nTo avoid resistance and contest, would the following plan be available?\r\n\r\nWhen the bills, the decrees, and the other regulations are ready, would\r\nit be suitable for the King to hold an Extraordinary Council, to which\r\nhe should summon the Princes of the Royal family, the Archbishop of\r\nRheims, etc. Let all the bills to be brought forward be discussed and\r\nsettled in that Council, and let the Princes and the chief Bishops\r\ndeclare which of these are to be adopted by unanimous consent. If, after\r\nthis Council, all the great and influential personages summoned by his\r\nMajesty were to announce that such was the common wish of the King and\r\nthe whole of the Royal family, France would perhaps be saved.\r\n\r\nBut the great remedy lies in the King's pleasure. Let that once be\r\nmanifested, and let its execution be recommended by his Majesty to all\r\nwho surround him, and the danger disappears.\r\n\r\n\"Domine dic tantum verbum, et sanabitur Gallia tua!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Correspondence between the Viscount de Chateaubriand, the Count\r\nDecazes, Minister of General Police, and M. Dambray, Chancellor of\r\nFrance, on occasion of the seizure of 'Monarchy according to the\r\nCharter,' in consequence of an infraction of the laws and regulations\r\nrelative to printing. September, 1816._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE SEIZURE.\r\n\r\n_October 19th, 1816._\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September, in execution of the warrant of his Excellency,\r\ndated on that day, authorizing the seizure of a work entitled, 'Of\r\nMonarchy according to the Charter,' by M. de Chateaubriand, printed by\r\nLe Normant, Rue de Seine, No. 8, and which work had been on sale without\r\nthe deposit of five copies having been made at the office for the\r\ngeneral regulation of the book-trade, I went, with Messrs. Joly and\r\nDussiriez, peace-officers and inspectors, to the house of the abovenamed\r\nM. Le Normant, where we arrived before ten o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nM. Le Normant admitted to us that he had given notice of the work of\r\nM. de Chateaubriand, but that he had not yet deposited the five copies.\r\nHe affirmed that on the same morning, at nine o'clock, he had sent to\r\nthe office for the general regulation of bookselling, but that he was\r\ntold that the office was not open. Of this he produced no proof.\r\n\r\nHe admitted that he had printed two thousand copies of this work,\r\nintending to make a fresh declaration, the first having only been for\r\nfifteen hundred copies; that he had delivered several hundreds copies to\r\nthe author; that, finally, he had transmitted others on sale to the\r\nprincipal booksellers of the Palais-Royal, Delaunay, Petit, and Fabre.\r\n\r\nWhile I was drawing up a report of these facts and statements,\r\nM. de Wilminet, peace-officer, came in with an individual in whose hands\r\nhe had seen, near the Bridge of the Arts, the work now in question, at\r\nthe moment when the person, who says his name is Derosne, was looking\r\nover the title. M. Derosne has admitted that he bought it for four\r\nfrancs, on the same day, the 18th, at about nine and a half in the\r\nmorning. This copy has been deposited in our hands, and M. Le Normant\r\nhas reimbursed the cost to M. Derosne.\r\n\r\nWe seized, in the second warehouse on the first floor, thirty stitched\r\ncopies which we added to that of M. Derosne. In the workshops on the\r\nground-floor, I seized a considerable quantity of printed sheets of the\r\nsame work, which M. Le Normant estimates at nine thousand sheets; and\r\nthirty-one printing-forms which had been used for printing these sheets.\r\n\r\nAs it was sufficiently proved, both by facts and the admissions of the\r\nprinter, that the work had been offered for sale before the five copies\r\nwere deposited, we took possession of the stitched copies, the sheets,\r\nand the forms. The sheets were subsequently piled up in a carriage in\r\nthe courtyard, and the stitched volumes made into a parcel, were\r\ndeposited at the foot of the staircase at the entrance of the house. The\r\nforms, to the number of thirty-one, were placed under the steps of the\r\ngarden, tied together with cord. Our seal had been already placed on the\r\ntop, and M. de Wilminet prepared to affix it also on the lower parts.\r\nAll this was done without the slightest disturbance or opposition, and\r\nwith a perfect respect for the authorities.\r\n\r\nSuddenly tumultuous cries were heard at the bottom of the entrance\r\ncourt. M. de Chateaubriand arrived at that moment, and questioned some\r\nworkmen who surrounded him. His words were interrupted by cries of \"Here\r\nis M. de Chateaubriand!\" The workshops resounded with his name; all the\r\nlabouring men came out in a crowd and ran towards the court, exclaiming,\r\n\"Here is M. de Chateaubriand! M. de Chateaubriand!\" I myself distinctly\r\nheard the cry of \"Long live M. de Chateaubriand!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a dozen infuriated workmen arrived at the gate of\r\nthe garden, where I then was with M. de Wilminet and two inspectors,\r\nengaged in finishing the seals on the forms. They broke the seals and\r\nprepared to carry off the forms; they cried loudly and with a\r\nthreatening air, \"Long live the liberty of the press! Long live the\r\nKing!\" We took advantage of a moment of silence to ask if any order had\r\narrived to suspend our work. \"Yes, yes, here is our order. Long live the\r\nliberty of the press!\" cried they with violent insolence: \"Long live the\r\nKing!\" They approached close to us to utter these cries. \"Well\" said I\r\nto them, \"if there is such an order, so much the better; let it be\r\nproduced;\" and we all said together, \"You shall not touch these forms,\r\nuntil we have seen the order.\" \"Yes, yes,\" cried they again, \"there is\r\nan order; it comes from M. de Chateaubriand, he is a Peer of France. An\r\norder from M. de Chateaubriand is worth more than one from the\r\nMinister.\" Then they repeated violently the cries of \"Long live the\r\nliberty of the press! Long live the King!\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the peace-officers and inspectors continued to guard\r\nthe articles seized or sequestered, and prevented their being carried\r\noff. They took the parcel of stitched copies from the hands of a workman\r\nwho was bearing it away.\r\n\r\nThe peace-officer who was affixing the seals, being compelled by\r\nviolence to suspend the operation, addressed M. de Chateaubriand, and\r\nasked him if he had an order from the Minister. He replied, with\r\npassion, that an order from the Minister was nothing to him; he came to\r\noppose what was going on; he was a Peer of France, the defender of the\r\nCharter, and particularly forbade anything to be taken away. \"Moreover,\"\r\nhe added, \"this proceeding is useless and without object; I have\r\ndistributed fifteen thousand copies of this work through all the\r\ndifferent departments.\" The workmen then repeated that the order of\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was worth more than that of the Minister, and\r\nrenewed, more violently than before, their cries of \"Long live the\r\nliberty of the press! M. de Chateaubriand for ever! Long live the King!\"\r\n\r\nThe peace-officer was surrounded. A man of colour, appearing much\r\nexcited, said to him violently, \"The order of M. de Chateaubriand is\r\nworth more than that of the Minister.\" Tumultuous cries were renewed\r\nround the peace-officer. I left the garden, leaving the forms in charge\r\nof the inspectors, to advance towards that side. During my passage,\r\nseveral workmen shouted violently, \"Long live the King!\" I held out my\r\nhand as a sign of peace, to keep at a respectful distance those who were\r\ndisposed to come too near; and replied by the loyal cry of \"Long live\r\nthe King!\" to the same shout uttered in a seditious spirit by the\r\nbewildered workmen.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand was at this time in the entrance court, apparently\r\nintent on preventing the carriage laden with the sheets of his work from\r\ndeparting for its destination. I ascended the staircase for the purpose\r\nof signifying to M. Le Normant that it would be better for him to second\r\nmy orders by using whatever influence he might possess over his workmen,\r\nso as to induce them to return to their workshops; and to let him know\r\nbefore them that he would be held responsible for what might happen.\r\nM. de Chateaubriand appeared at the foot of the staircase, and uttered,\r\nin a very impassioned tone, with his voice vehemently raised, in the\r\nmidst of the workmen, who appeared to second him enthusiastically,\r\nnearly the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"I am a Peer of France. I do not acknowledge the order of the Ministry;\r\nI oppose it in the name of the Charter, of which I am the defender, and\r\nthe protection of which every citizen may claim. I oppose the removal of\r\nmy work. I forbid the transport of these sheets. I will only yield to\r\nforce, and when I see the gendarmes.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately, raising my voice to a loud tone, and extending my arm from\r\nthe first landing-place of the staircase on which I then stood, I\r\nreplied to him who had just manifested to myself formally and personally\r\nhis determined resistance to the execution of the orders of his\r\nMajesty's minister, and had thereby shown that he was the real exciter\r\nof the movements that had taken place; I said--\r\n\r\n\"And I, in the name and on the part of the King, in my quality of\r\nCommissary of Police, appointed by his Majesty, and acting under the\r\norders of his Excellency the Minister of General Police, demand respect\r\nfor constituted authority. Let everything remain untouched; let all\r\ntumult cease, until the arrival of fresh orders which I expect from his\r\nExcellency.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I uttered these words, profound silence was maintained. Calm had\r\nsucceeded to tumult. Soon after, the gendarmes arrived. I then ordered\r\nthe workmen to return to their workshops. M. de Chateaubriand, as soon\r\nas the gendarmes entered, retired into the apartments of M. Le Normant,\r\nand appeared no more. We then finished our work and prepared the report\r\nof all that had occurred, after having despatched to the Ministry of\r\nPolice the articles seized, and committed the forms to the guard, and\r\nunder the responsibility of M. Le Normant.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the disturbance one of the stitched copies disappeared.\r\nSubsequently we seized, at the house of M. Le Marchand, a book-stitcher,\r\nand formerly a bookseller, in the Rue de la Parcheminerie, seven parcels\r\nof copies of the same work; and at No. 17, Rue des Pretres, in a\r\nwareroom belonging to M. Le Normant, we placed eight forms under seal,\r\nand seized four thousand sheets of the same work.\r\n\r\nI have forwarded to the Ministry of Police reports of these different\r\noperations, with the sheets and copies seized of the work of\r\nM. de Chateaubriand.\r\n\r\nM. Le Normant appeared to me to conduct himself without blame during\r\nthese transactions, which were carried into effect at his\r\ndwelling-place, and during the tumult which M. de Chateaubriand promoted\r\non the occasion of the seizure of his work. But it is sufficiently\r\nproved by his own admission and by facts, that he has issued for sale to\r\nvarious booksellers, and has sold himself copies of this work before he\r\nhad deposited the five as required by the laws.\r\n\r\nAs to M. de Chateaubriand, I am astonished that he should have so\r\nscandalously compromised the dignity of the titles with which he is\r\ndecorated, by exhibiting himself under these circumstances, as if he had\r\nbeen nothing more than the leader of a troop of workmen, whom he had\r\nstirred up to commotion.\r\n\r\nHe was the cause of the workmen profaning the sacred cry of \"Long live\r\nthe King!\" by using it in an act of rebellion against the authority of\r\nthe Government, which is the same as that of the King.\r\n\r\nHe has excited these misguided men against a Commissary of Police, a\r\npublic functionary appointed by his Majesty, and against three\r\npeace-officers in the execution of their duty, and without arms against\r\na multitude.\r\n\r\nHe has committed an offence against the Royal government, by saying that\r\nhe would acknowledge force alone, in a system based upon quite a\r\ndifferent force from that of bayonets, and which only uses such coercive\r\nmeasures against persons who are strangers to every sentiment of honour.\r\n\r\nFinally, this scene might have led to serious consequences if, imitating\r\nthe conduct of M. de Chateaubriand, we had forgotten for a moment that\r\nwe were acting by the orders of a Government as moderate as firm, and\r\nas strong in its wisdom as in its legitimacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO THE COUNT DECAZES.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September 18th, 1816._\r\n\r\n   My Lord Count,\r\n\r\nI called at your residence this morning to express my surprise. At\r\ntwelve this day, I found at the house of M. Le Normant, my bookseller,\r\nsome men who said they were sent by you to seize my new work, entitled\r\n'Of Monarchy according to the Charter.'\r\n\r\nNot seeing any written order, I declared that I would not allow the\r\nremoval of my property unless gendarmes seized it by force. Some\r\ngendarmes arrived, and I then ordered my bookseller to allow the work to\r\nbe carried away.\r\n\r\nThis act of deference to authority has not allowed me to forget what I\r\nowe to my rank as a Peer. If I had only considered my personal\r\ninterests, I should not have interfered; but the privileges of the\r\nPeerage having been compromised, I have thought it right to enter a\r\nprotest, a copy of which I have now the honour of forwarding to you. I\r\ndemand, in the name of justice, the restitution of my work; and I\r\ncandidly add, that if I do not receive it back, I shall employ every\r\npossible means that the political and civil laws place within my reach.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be, etc. etc.,\r\n\r\n   (Signed)   COUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE COUNT DECAZES TO THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September 18th, 1816._\r\n\r\n   My Lord Viscount,\r\n\r\nThe Commissary of Police and the peace-officers, against whom you have\r\nthought proper to excite the rebellion of M. Le Normant's workmen, were\r\nthe bearers of an order signed by one of the King's ministers, and in\r\naccordance with a law. That order was shown to the printer named, who\r\nread it several times, and felt that he had no right to oppose its\r\nexecution, demanded in the King's name. Undoubtedly it never occurred to\r\nhim that your rank as a Peer could place you above the operation of the\r\nlaws, release you from the respect due by all citizens to public\r\nfunctionaries in the execution of their duty, and, above all, justify a\r\nrevolt of his work-people against a Commissary of Police, and officers\r\nappointed by the King, invested with the distinctive symbols of their\r\noffice, and acting under legal instructions.\r\n\r\nI have seen with regret that you have thought otherwise, and that you\r\nhave preferred, as you now require of me, to yield to force rather than\r\nto obey the law. That law, which M. Le Normant had infringed, is\r\nextremely distinct; it requires that no work whatever shall be published\r\nclandestinely, and that no publication or sale shall take place before\r\nthe necessary deposit has been made at the office for the regulation of\r\nprinting. None of these conditions have been fulfilled by M. Le Normant.\r\nIf he has given notice, it was informal; for he has himself signed the\r\nReport drawn up by the Commissary of Police, to the effect that he\r\nproposed to strike off 1500 copies, and that he had already printed\r\n2000.\r\n\r\nFrom another quarter I have been informed that, although no deposit has\r\nbeen made at the office for the regulation of printing, several hundred\r\ncopies have been despatched this morning before nine o'clock, from the\r\nresidence of M. Le Normant, and sent to you, and to various booksellers;\r\nthat other copies have been sold by M. Le Normant at his own house, for\r\nthe price of four francs; and two of these last copies were in my hands\r\nthis morning by half-past eight o'clock.\r\n\r\nI have considered it my duty not to allow this infraction of the law,\r\nand to interdict the sale of a work thus clandestinely and illegally\r\npublished; I have therefore ordered its seizure, in conformity with\r\nArticles 14 and 15 of the Law of the 21st of October, 1814.\r\n\r\nNo one in France, my Lord Viscount, is above the law; the Peers would be\r\noffended, on just grounds, if I thought they could set up such a\r\npretension. Still less would they assume that the works which they feel\r\ndisposed to publish and sell as private individuals and men of letters,\r\nwhen they wish to honour the literary profession with their labours,\r\nshould enjoy exclusive privileges; and if these works are submitted to\r\npublic criticism in common with those of other writers, they are not in\r\nany respect liberated from the control of justice, or the supervision of\r\nthe Police, whose duty it is to take care that the laws, which are\r\nequally binding upon all classes of society, should be executed with\r\nequal impartiality.\r\n\r\nI must also observe, in addition, that it was at the residence and\r\nprinting-office of M. Le Normant, who is not a Peer of France, that the\r\norder constitutionally issued for the seizure of a work published by him\r\nin contravention to the law, was carried into effect; that the execution\r\nof the order had been completed when you presented yourself; and upon\r\nyour declaration that you would not suffer your work to be taken away,\r\nthe workmen broke the seals that had been affixed on some articles, and\r\nplaced themselves in open rebellion against the King's authority. It can\r\nscarcely have escaped you, that by invoking that august name they have\r\nbeen guilty of a crime of which, no doubt, they did not perceive the\r\nextent; and to which they could not have been led, had they been more\r\nimpressed with the respect due to the act of the King and his\r\nrepresentatives, and if it could so happen that they did not read what\r\nthey print.\r\n\r\nI have felt these explanations due to your character; they will, I\r\ntrust, convince you that if the dignity of the Peerage has been\r\ncompromised in this matter, it has not been through me.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be,\r\n             My Lord Viscount,\r\n   Your very humble and very obedient Servant,\r\n         (Signed)  THE COUNT DECAZES.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO THE COUNT DECAZES.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September 19th, 1816._\r\n\r\n   My Lord Count,\r\n\r\nI have received the letter which you have done me the honour to address\r\nto me on the 18th of this month. It contains no answer to mine of the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nYou speak to me of works _clandestinely_ published (in the face of the\r\nsun, with my name and titles). You speak of revolt and rebellion, when\r\nthere has been neither revolt nor rebellion. You say that there were\r\ncries of \"Long live the King!\" That cry has not yet been included in the\r\nlaw of seditious exclamations, unless the Police are empowered to decree\r\nin opposition to the Chambers. For the rest, all will appear in due time\r\nand place. There will be no longer a pretence to confound the cause of\r\nthe bookseller with mine; we shall soon know whether, under a free\r\ngovernment, a police order, which I have not even seen, is binding on a\r\nPeer of France; we shall learn whether, in my case, all the rights\r\nsecured to me by the charter, have not been violated, both as a Citizen\r\nand a Peer. We shall learn, through the laws themselves, which you have\r\nthe extreme kindness to quote for me (a little incorrectly, it may be\r\nobserved), whether I have not the right to publish my opinions; we shall\r\nlearn, finally, whether France is henceforward to be governed by the\r\nPolice or by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of my respect and loyalty to the King, my Lord Count, I\r\nrequire no lessons, and I might supply an example. With respect to my\r\nrank as a Peer, I shall endeavour to make it respected, equally with my\r\ndignity as a man; and I perfectly well knew, before you took the trouble\r\nto inform me, that it will never be compromised either by you or any one\r\nelse. I have demanded at your hands the restitution of my work: am I to\r\nhope that it will be restored? This is the immediate question.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   My Lord Count,\r\n   Your very humble and very obedient Servant,\r\n   (Signed) THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO THE CHANCELLOR DAMBRAY.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September 18th, 1816._\r\n\r\n   My Lord Chancellor,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to forward to you a copy of the protest I have\r\nentered, and the letter I have just written to the Minister of Police.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange, my Lord Chancellor, that in open day, by force, and\r\nin defiance of my remonstrances, the work of a Peer of France, to which\r\nmy name is attached, and printed publicly in Paris, should have been\r\ncarried off by the Police, as if it were a seditious or clandestine\r\npublication, such as the 'Yellow Dwarf,' or the 'Tri-coloured Dwarf'?\r\nBeyond what was due to my prerogative as a Peer of France, I may venture\r\nto say that I deserved _personally_ a little more respect. If my work\r\nwere objectionable, I might have been summoned before the competent\r\ntribunals: I should have answered the appeal.\r\n\r\nI have protested for the honour of the Peerage, and I am determined to\r\nfollow up this matter to the last extremity. I call for your support as\r\nPresident of the Chamber of Peers, and for your interference as the head\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\n   I am, with profound respect, etc. etc.,\r\n   (Signed) THE VISCOUNT CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE CHANCELLOR DAMBRAY TO THE COUNT DECAZES.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September, 19th, 1816._\r\n\r\nI send you confidentially, my dear colleague, a letter which I received\r\nyesterday from M. de Chateaubriand, with the informal Protest of which\r\nhe has made me the depository. I beg you will return these documents,\r\nwhich ought not to be made public. I enclose also a copy of my answer,\r\nwhich I also request you to return after reading; for I have kept no\r\nother. I hope it will meet your approbation.\r\n\r\nI repeat the expression of my friendly sentiments.\r\n\r\n   DAMBRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. THE CHANCELLOR DAMBRAY TO THE VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, September 19th, 1816._\r\n\r\n   My Lord Viscount,\r\n\r\nI have received with the letter you have addressed to me, the\r\ndeclaration relative to the seizure which took place at the residence of\r\nyour bookseller; I find it difficult to understand the use you propose\r\nto make of this document, which cannot extenuate in any manner the\r\ninfraction of law committed by M. Le Normant. The Law of the 21st of\r\nOctober, 1814, is precise on this point. No printer can publish or offer\r\nfor sale any work, in any manner whatever, before having deposited the\r\nprescribed number of copies. There is ground for seizure, the Article\r\nadds, and for sequestrating a work, if the printer does not produce the\r\nreceipts of the deposit ordered by the preceding Article.\r\n\r\nAll infractions of this law (Art. 20) will be proved by the reports of\r\nthe inspectors of the book-trade, and the Commissaries of Police.\r\n\r\nYou were probably unacquainted with these enactments when you fancied\r\nthat your quality as a Peer of France gave you the right of personally\r\nopposing an act of the Police, ordered and sanctioned by the law, which\r\nall Frenchmen, whatever may be their rank, are equally bound to respect.\r\n\r\nI am too much attached to you, Viscount, not to feel deep regret at the\r\npart you have taken in the scandalous scene which seems to have occurred\r\nwith reference to this matter, and I regret sincerely that you have\r\nadded errors of form to the real mistake of a publication which you\r\ncould not but feel must be unpleasant to his Majesty. I know nothing of\r\nyour work beyond the dissatisfaction which the King has publicly\r\nexpressed with it; but I am grieved to notice the impression it has\r\nmade upon a monarch who, on every occasion, has condescended to evince\r\nas much esteem for your person as admiration for your talents.\r\n\r\nReceive, Viscount, the assurance of my high consideration, and of my\r\ninviolable attachment.\r\n\r\n   The Chancellor of France,\r\n\r\n   DAMBRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE PRINCIPAL REFORMS EFFECTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF FRANCE\r\nFROM 1816 TO 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR (M.

GUIZOT TO M. DE SERRE.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, April 12th, 1820._\r\n\r\n   My dear Friend,\r\n\r\nI have not written to you in all our troubles. I knew that you would\r\nhear from this place a hundred different opinions, and a hundred\r\nopposite statements on the position of affairs; and, although I had not\r\nentire confidence in any of those who addressed you, as you are not\r\ncalled upon, according to my judgment, to form any important resolution,\r\nI abstained from useless words. Today all has become clearer and more\r\nmature; the situation assumes externally the character it had until now\r\nconcealed; I feel the necessity of telling you what I think of it, for\r\nthe advantage of our future proceedings in general, and yours in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThe provisional bills have passed:--you have seen how: fatal to those\r\nwho have gained them, and with immense profit to the Opposition. The\r\ndebate has produced this result in the Chamber, that the right-hand\r\nparty has extinguished itself, to follow in the suite of the\r\nright-centre; while the left-centre has consented to assume the same\r\nposition with respect to the extreme left, from which, however, it has\r\nbegun to separate within the last fifteen days. So much for the interior\r\nof the Chamber.\r\n\r\nWithout, you may be assured that the effect of these two debates upon\r\nthe popular masses has been to cause the right-hand party to be looked\r\nupon as less haughty and exacting; the left, as more firm and more\r\nevenly regulated than was supposed: so that, at present, in the\r\nestimation of many worthy citizens, the fear of the right and the\r\nsuspicion of the left are diminished in equal proportions. A great evil\r\nis comprised in this double fact. Last year we gained triumphs over the\r\nleft, without and within the Chamber; at present the left triumphs over\r\nus! Last year we still remained, and were considered, as ever since\r\n1815, a necessary and safe rampart against the _Ultras_, who were\r\ngreatly dreaded, and whose rule seemed possible; today the _Ultras_ are\r\nless feared, because their arrival at power is scarcely believed. The\r\nconclusion is, that we are less wanted than formerly.\r\n\r\nLet us look to the future. The election bill, which Decazes presented\r\neight days before his fall, is about to be withdrawn. This is certain.\r\nIt is well known that it could never pass; that the discussions on its\r\nforty-eight articles would be interminable; the _Ultras_ are very\r\nmistrustful of this its probable results; it is condemned; they will\r\nframe, and are already framing, another. What will this new bill be? I\r\ncannot tell. What appears to me certain is, that, if no change takes\r\nplace in the present position, it will have for object, not to complete\r\nour institutions, not to correct the vices of the bill of the 5th of\r\nFebruary, 1817, but to bring back exceptional elections; to restore, as\r\nis loudly proclaimed, something analogous to the Chamber of 1815. This\r\nis the avowed object, and, what is more, the natural and necessary end.\r\nThis end will be pursued without accomplishment; such a bill will either\r\nfail in the debate, or in the application. If it passes, and after the\r\ndebate which it cannot fail to provoke, the fundamental question, the\r\nquestion of the future, will escape from the Chamber, and seek its\r\nsolution without, in the intervention of the masses. If the bill is\r\nrejected, the question may be confined within the Chamber; but it will\r\nno longer be the Ministry in office who will have the power and mission\r\nof solving it. If a choice is left to us, which I am far from despairing\r\nof, it will lie between a lamentable external revolution and a\r\nministerial revolution of the most complete character. And this last\r\nchance, which is our only one, will vanish if we do not so manage as to\r\noffer the country, for the future, a ministry boldly constitutional.\r\n\r\nIn this position of affairs, what it is indispensable that you should be\r\nmade acquainted with, and what you would discover in five minutes if you\r\ncould pass five minutes here, is, that you are no longer a Minister, and\r\nthat you form no portion of the Ministry in office. It would be\r\nimpossible to induce you to speak with them as they speak, or as they\r\nare compelled to speak. The situation to which they are reduced has been\r\nimposed by necessity; they could only escape from it by completely\r\nchanging their ground and their friends, by recovering eighty votes from\r\nthe one hundred and fifteen of the actual Opposition, or by an appeal to\r\na new Chamber. This last measure it will never adopt; and by the side of\r\nthe powerlessness of the existing Cabinet, stands the impossibility of\r\nescaping from it by the aid of the right-hand party. An _ultra_ ministry\r\nis impossible. The events in Spain, whatever they may ultimately lead\r\nto, have mortally wounded the governments of _coups d'etat_ and\r\nordinances.\r\n\r\nI have looked closely into all this, my dear friend; I have thought much\r\non the subject when alone, more than I have communicated to others. You\r\ncannot remain indefinitely in a situation so critical and weak, so\r\ndestitute of power for immediate government, and so hopeless for the\r\nfuture. I see but one thing to do at present; and that is, to prepare\r\nand hold back those who may save the Monarchy. I cannot see, in the\r\nexisting state of affairs, any possibility of labouring effectively for\r\nits preservation. You can only drag yourselves timidly along the\r\nprecipice which leads to its ruin. You may possibly not lose in the\r\nstruggle your reputation for honest intentions and good-faith; but this\r\nis the maximum of hope which the present Cabinet can reasonably expect\r\nto preserve. Do not deceive yourself on this point; of all the plans of\r\nreform, at once monarchical and liberal, which you contemplated last\r\nyear, nothing now remains. It is no longer a bold remedy which is sought\r\nfor against the old revolutionary spirit; it is a miserable expedient\r\nwhich is adopted without confidence. It is not fit for you, my dear\r\nfriend, to remain garotted under this system. Thank Heaven! you were\r\naccounted of some importance in the exceptional laws. As to the\r\nconstitutional projects emanating from you, there are several--the\r\nintegral renewing of the Chamber, for example--which have rather gained\r\nthan lost ground, and which have become possible in another direction\r\nand with other men. I know that nothing happens either so decisively or\r\ncompletely as has been calculated, and that everything is, with time, an\r\naffair of arrangement and treaty. But as power is situated at present,\r\nyou can do nothing, you are nothing; or rather, at this moment, you have\r\nnot an inch of ground on which you can either hold yourself erect, or\r\nfall with honour. If you were here, either you would emerge, within a\r\nweek, from this impotent position, or you would be lost with the rest,\r\nwhich Heaven forbid!\r\n\r\nYou see, my dear friend, that I speak to you with the most unmeasured\r\nfrankness. It is because I have a profound conviction of the present\r\nevil and of the possibility of future safety. In this possibility you\r\nare a necessary instrument. Do not suffer yourself, while at a distance,\r\nto be compromised in what is neither your opinion nor your desire.\r\nRegulate your own destiny, or at least your position in the common\r\ndestiny of all; and if you must fall, let it be for your own cause, and\r\nin accordance with your own convictions.\r\n\r\nI add to this letter the Bill prepared by M. de Serre in November, 1819,\r\nand which he intended to present to the Chambers, to complete the\r\nCharter, and at the same time to reform the electoral law. It will be\r\nseen how much this Bill differed from that introduced in April, 1820,\r\nwith reference to the law of elections alone, and which M. de Serre\r\nsupported as a member of the second Cabinet of the Duke de Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILL FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nArt. 1. The Legislature assumes the name of Parliament of France.\r\n\r\nArt. 2. The King convokes the Parliament every year.\r\n\r\nParliament will be convoked extraordinarily, at the latest, within two\r\nmonths after the King attains his majority, or succeeds to the throne;\r\nor under any event which may cause the establishment of a Regency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Peerage._\r\n\r\nArt. 3. The Peerage can only be conferred on a Frenchman who has\r\nattained his majority, and is in the exercise of political and civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. The character of Peer is indelible; it can neither be lost nor\r\nabdicated, from the moment when it has been conferred by the King.\r\n\r\nArt. 5. The exercise of the rights and privileges of Peer can only be\r\nsuspended under two conditions:--1. Condemnation to corporal punishment;\r\n2. Interdiction pronounced according to the forms prescribed by the\r\nCivil Code. In either case, by the Chamber of Peers alone.\r\n\r\nArt. 6. The Peers are admissible to the Chamber at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, and can vote when they have completed their twenty-fifth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nArt. 7. In case of the death of a Peer, his successor in the Peerage\r\nwill be admitted as soon as he has attained the required age, on\r\nfulfilling the forms prescribed by the decree of the 23rd of March,\r\n1816, which decree will be annexed to the present law.\r\n\r\nArt. 8. A Peerage created by the King cannot henceforward, during the\r\nlife of the titulary, be declared transmissible, except to the real and\r\nlegitimate male children of the created Peer.\r\n\r\nArt. 9. The inheritance of the Peerage cannot henceforward be conferred\r\nuntil a Majorat of the net revenue of twenty thousand francs, at least,\r\nshall be attached to the Peerage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dotation of the Peerage._\r\n\r\nArt. 10. The Peerage will be endowed--1, With three millions five\r\nhundred thousand francs of rent, entered upon the great-book of the\r\npublic debt, which sum will be unalienable, and exclusively applied to\r\nthe formation of Majorats; 2, With eight hundred thousand francs of\r\nrent, equally entered and inalienable, to be applied to the expenses of\r\nthe Chamber of Peers.\r\n\r\nBy means of this dotation, these expenses cease to be charged to the\r\nBudget of the State, and the domains, rents, and property of every kind,\r\nproceeding from the dotation of the former Senate, except the Palace of\r\nthe Luxembourg and its dependencies, are reunited to the property of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nArt. 11. Three millions five hundred thousand francs of rent, intended\r\nfor the formation of Majorats, are divided into fifty majorats of thirty\r\nthousand francs, and one hundred majorats of twenty thousand francs\r\neach, attached to the same number of peerages.\r\n\r\nArt. 12. These Majorats will be conferred by the King exclusively upon\r\nlay Peers; they will be transmissible with the Peerage from male to\r\nmale, in order of primogeniture, and in the real, direct, and legitimate\r\nline only.\r\n\r\nArt. 13. A Peer cannot unite in his own person several of these\r\nMajorats.\r\n\r\nArt. 14. Immediately on the endowment of a Majorat, and on the\r\nproduction of letters-patent, the titulary will be entered in the\r\ngreat-book of the public debt, for an unalienable revenue, according to\r\nthe amount of his majorat.\r\n\r\nArt. 15. In case of the extinction of the successors to any one of these\r\nMajorats, it reverts to the King's gift, who can confer it again,\r\naccording to the above-named regulations.\r\n\r\nArt. 16. The King can permit the titulary possessor of a Majorat to\r\nconvert it into real property producing the same revenue, and which will\r\nbe subject to the same reversion.\r\n\r\nArt. 17. The dotation of the Peerage is inalienable, and cannot under\r\nany pretext whatever, be applied to any other purpose than that\r\nprescribed by the present law. This dotation remains charged, even to\r\nextinction, with the pensions at present enjoyed by the former Senators,\r\nas also with those which have been or may hereafter be granted to their\r\nwidows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Chamber of Deputies._\r\n\r\nArt. 18. The Chamber of Deputies to Parliament is composed of four\r\nhundred and fifty-six members.\r\n\r\nArt. 19. The Deputies to Parliament are elected for seven years.\r\n\r\nArt. 20. The Chamber is renewed integrally, either in case of\r\ndissolution, or at the expiration of the time for which the Deputies are\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nArt. 21. The President of the Chamber of Deputies is elected according\r\nto the ordinary forms for the entire duration of the Parliament.\r\n\r\nArt. 22. The rates which must be paid by an elector, or one eligible for\r\nan elector, consist of the principal of the direct taxes without regard\r\nto the additional hundredths. To this effect, the taxes for doors and\r\nwindows will be separated from the the principal and additional\r\nhundredths, in such manner that two-thirds of the entire tax may be\r\nentered as principal and the remaining third as additional hundredths.\r\nFor the future this plan will be permanent; the augmentations or\r\ndiminutions of these two taxes will be made by the addition or\r\nreduction of the additional hundredths: the same rule will apply to the\r\ntaxes on land, moveables, and other personal property, as soon as the\r\nprincipal of each is definitely settled. The tax on land and that on\r\ndoors and windows will only be charged to the proprietor or temporary\r\npossessor, notwithstanding any contrary arrangement.\r\n\r\nArt. 23. A son is liable for the taxes of his father, and a son-in-law\r\nwhose wife is alive, or who has children by her, for the taxes of his\r\nfather-in-law, in all cases where the father or father-in-law have\r\ntransferred to them their respective rights.\r\n\r\nThe taxes of a widow, not re-married, are chargeable to whichever of her\r\nsons, or, in default of sons, to whichever of her sons-in-law, she may\r\ndesignate.\r\n\r\nArt. 24. To constitute the eligibility of an elector, these taxes must\r\nhave been paid one year at least before the day of the election. The\r\nheir or legatee on the general title, is considered responsible for the\r\ntaxes payable by the parties from whom he derives.\r\n\r\nArt. 25. Every elector and Deputy is bound to make affidavit, if\r\nrequired, that they pay really and personally, or that those whose\r\nrights they exercise pay really and personally, the rates required by\r\nthe law; that they, or those whose rights they exercise, are the true\r\nand legitimate owners of the property on account of which the taxes are\r\npaid, or that they truly exercise the trade for the license of which the\r\ntaxes are imposed.\r\n\r\nThis affidavit is received by the Chamber, for the Deputies, and at the\r\nelectoral offices for the electors. It is signed by them, without\r\nprejudice to contradictory evidence.\r\n\r\nArt. 26. Every Frenchman who has completed the age of thirty on the day\r\nof election, who is in the enjoyment of civil and political rights, and\r\nwho pays a direct tax amounting to six hundred francs in principal, is\r\neligible to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nArt. 27. The Deputies to Parliament are named partly by the electors of\r\nthe department, and partly by the electors of the divisions into which\r\neach department is divided, in conformity with the table annexed to the\r\npresent law.\r\n\r\nThe electors of each electoral divisions nominate directly the number of\r\nDeputies fixed by the same table.\r\n\r\nThis rule applies to the electors of each department.\r\n\r\nArt. 28. All Frenchmen who have completed the age of thirty years, who\r\nexercise political and civil rights, who have their residence in the\r\ndepartment, and who pay a direct tax of four hundred francs in\r\nprincipal, are electors for the department.\r\n\r\nArt. 29. When the electors for the department are less than fifty in the\r\ndepartment of Corsica, less than one hundred in the departments in the\r\nhigher and lower Alps, of the Ardeche, of the Ariege, or the Correze, of\r\nthe Creuse, of the Lozere, of the higher Marne, of the higher Pyrenees,\r\nof Vaucluse, of the Vosges; less than two hundred in the departments of\r\nthe Ain, of the Ardennes, of the Aube, of the Aveyron, of the Central,\r\nof the Coasts of the North, of the Doubs, of the Drome, of the Jura, of\r\nthe Landes, of the Lot, of the Meuse, of the lower Pyrenees, of the\r\nlower and upper Rhine, of the upper Saone; and less than three hundred\r\nin the other departments; these numbers are to be completed by calling\r\non those who are next in the ratio of taxation.\r\n\r\nArt. 30. All Frenchmen aged thirty years complete, who exercise\r\npolitical and civil rights, who dwell in the electoral division, and who\r\npay a direct tax of two hundred francs in principal, are electors for\r\nthe division.\r\n\r\nArt. 31. The electors of departments exercise their rights as electors\r\nof division, each in the division in which he dwells. To this effect,\r\nthe elections for the departments will not take place till after those\r\nfor the division.\r\n\r\nArt. 32. The Deputies to Parliament named by the electors of division\r\nought to be domiciled in the department, or at least to be proprietors\r\nthere for more than a year, of a property paying six hundred francs in\r\nprincipal, or to have exercised public functions there for three years\r\nat the least.\r\n\r\nThe Deputies nominated by the electors of departments may be selected\r\nfrom all who are eligible throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forms of Election._\r\n\r\nArt. 33. At the hour and on the day fixed for the election, the Board\r\nwill repair to the hall selected for its sittings. The Board is to be\r\ncomposed of a President appointed by the King, of the Mayor, of the\r\nsenior Justice of the Peace, and of the two chief Municipal Councillors\r\nof the head-towns in which the election is held. At Paris, the senior\r\nMayor and Justice of the Peace of the electoral division, and two\r\nmembers of the general Council of the Department, taken according to the\r\norder of their appointment, are to co-operate with the President in the\r\nformation of the Board.\r\n\r\nThe duties of secretary will be fulfilled by the Mayor's secretary.\r\n\r\nArt. 34. The votes are given publicly by the inscription which each\r\nelector makes himself, or dictates to a member of the Board, of the\r\nnames of the candidates upon an open register. The elector inscribes the\r\nnames of as many candidates as there are Deputies to elect.\r\n\r\nArt. 35. In order that any eligible person may become a candidate, and\r\nthat the register may be opened in his favour, it is necessary that he\r\nshould have been proposed to the Board by twenty electors at least, who\r\ninscribe his name upon the register.\r\n\r\nAt Paris, no one can be proposed, at the same election, as a candidate\r\nin more than two electoral districts at the same time.\r\n\r\nArt. 36. At the opening of each sitting, the President announces the\r\nnames of the candidates proposed, and the number of votes that each has\r\nobtained. The same announcement is printed and posted in the town after\r\nevery sitting.\r\n\r\nArt. 37. The register for the first series of votes remains open for\r\nthree days at least, and for six hours every day.\r\n\r\nNo Deputy can be elected by the first series of votes, except by an\r\nabsolute majority of the electors of the district and department, who\r\nhave voted during the three days.\r\n\r\nArt. 38. The third day and the hour appointed for voting having expired,\r\nthe register is declared closed; the votes are summed up; the total\r\nnumber and the number given to each candidate are published, and the\r\ncandidates who have obtained an absolute majority are announced.\r\n\r\nIf all the Deputies have not been elected by the first scrutiny of\r\nvotes, the result is published and posted immediately; and after an\r\ninterval of three days, a second series of votes is taken during the\r\nfollowing days, in the same manner and under the same formalities and\r\ndelays. The candidates who obtain a relative majority at the second\r\nvoting are elected.\r\n\r\nArt. 39. Before closing the registers at each voting, the President\r\ndemands publicly whether there is any appeal against the manner in which\r\nthe votes have been inscribed. If objections are made, they are to be\r\nentered on the official report of the election, and the registers,\r\nclosed and sealed, are forwarded to the Chamber of Deputies, who will\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nIf there are no appeals, the registers are destroyed on the instant, and\r\nthe official report alone is forwarded to the Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe official report and registers are signed by all the members of the\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nIf there are grounds for a provisional decision, the Board has the power\r\nof pronouncing it.\r\n\r\nArt. 40. The President is invested with full power to maintain the\r\nfreedom of the elections. The civil and military authorities are bound\r\nto obey his requisitions. The President maintains silence in the hall\r\nin which the election is held, and will not allow any individual to be\r\npresent who is not an elector or a member of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrangements common to the two Chambers._\r\n\r\nArt. 41. No proposition can be sent to a committee until it has been\r\npreviously decided on in the Chamber. The Chamber, on all occasions,\r\nappoints the number of the members of the committee, and selects them,\r\neither by a single ballot from the entire list, or on the proposition of\r\ntheir own board.\r\n\r\nEvery motion coming from a Peer or Deputy must be announced at least\r\neight days beforehand, in the Chamber to which he belongs.\r\n\r\nArt. 42. No motion can be passed by the Chamber until after three\r\nseparate readings, each with an interval between them of eight days at\r\nthe least. The debate follows after each reading. When the debate has\r\nconcluded, the Chamber votes on a new reading. After the last debate, it\r\nvotes on the definitive adoption of the measure.\r\n\r\nArt. 43. Every amendment must be proposed before the second reading. An\r\namendment decided on after the second reading will of necessity demand\r\nanother reading after the same interval.\r\n\r\nArt. 44. Every amendment that may be discussed and voted separately from\r\nthe motion under debate, will be considered as a new motion, and will\r\nhave to undergo the same forms.\r\n\r\nArt. 45. Written speeches, except the reports of committees and the\r\nfirst opening of a motion, are interdicted.\r\n\r\nArt. 46. The Chamber of Peers cannot vote unless fifty Peers, at least,\r\nare present; the Chamber of Deputies cannot vote unless one hundred\r\nMembers, at least, are present.\r\n\r\nArt. 47. The vote in both Chambers is always public.\r\n\r\nFifteen Members can call for a division.\r\n\r\nThe division is made with closed doors.\r\n\r\nArt. 48. The Chamber of Peers can admit the public to its sittings. On\r\nthe demand of five Peers, or on that of the proposer of the motion, the\r\nsitting becomes private.\r\n\r\nArt. 49. The Chamber of Deputies can only form itself into a secret\r\ncommittee to hear and discuss the propositions of one of its Members,\r\nwhen a secret committee is asked by the proposer of the motion, or by\r\nfive Members at least.\r\n\r\nArt. 50. The arrangements of the laws now in operation, and particularly\r\nthose of the law of 17th February, 1817, and which are not affected by\r\nthe present law, will continue to be carried on according to their form\r\nand tenour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Temporary Arrangements._\r\n\r\nArt. 51. The Chamber of Deputies, from this date until the Session of\r\n1820, will be carried to the full number of 456 Members.\r\n\r\nTo this effect, the departments of the fourth series will each name the\r\nnumber of Deputies assigned to them by the present law; the other\r\ndepartments will also complete the number of Deputies, in the same\r\nmanner assigned to them. The Deputies appointed in execution of the\r\npresent article will be for seven years.\r\n\r\nArt. 52. If the number of Deputies to be named to complete the\r\ndeputation of any department, does not exceed that which the electors of\r\nthe department ought to elect, they will all be elected by these\r\nelectors. Should the case be otherwise, each Deputy exceeding this\r\nnumber will be chosen by the electors of one of the electoral divisions\r\nof the department, in the order hereinafter named:--\r\n\r\n1. By such of the electoral divisions as have the right of naming more\r\nthan one Deputy, unless one at least of the actual Deputies has his\r\npolitical residence in this division.\r\n\r\n2. By the first of the electoral divisions in which no actual Deputy has\r\nhis political residence.\r\n\r\n3. By the first of the electoral divisions in which one or more of the\r\nactual Deputies have their political residence, in such manner that no\r\nsingle division shall name more Deputies than those assigned to it by\r\nthe present law.\r\n\r\nArt. 53. At the expiration of the powers of the present Deputies of the\r\n5th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd series, a new election will be proceeded with for\r\nthe election of an equal number of Deputies for each respective\r\ndepartment, by such of the electoral divisions as have not, in execution\r\nof the preceding article, elected the full number of Deputies which are\r\nassigned to them by the present law.\r\n\r\nArt. 54. The Deputies to be named in execution of the preceding article\r\nwill be; those of the 5th series, for six years;--those of the 1st, for\r\nfive years; those of the 2nd, for four years; and those of the 3rd, for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nArt. 55. The regulations prescribed by the above articles will be\r\nobserved, if, between the present date and the integral renewing of the\r\nChamber, a necessity should arise for replacing a Deputy.\r\n\r\nArt. 56. All the elections that may take place under these temporary\r\nregulations, must be in accordance with the forms and conditions\r\nprescribed by the present law.\r\n\r\nArt. 57. In case of a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, it must be\r\nintegrally renewed within the term fixed by Article 50 of the Charter,\r\nand in conformity with the present law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XI.\r\n\r\n_Letters relative to my Dismissal from the Council of State, on the 17th\r\nJuly, 1820._\r\n\r\n\r\nM. DE SERRE (KEEPER OF THE GREAT SEAL) TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Paris, July 17th, 1820._\r\n\r\nI regret being compelled to announce to you that you have ceased to\r\nbelong to the Council of State. The violent hostility in which you have\r\nlately indulged, without the shadow of a pretext, against the King's\r\ngovernment, has rendered this measure inevitable. You will readily\r\nunderstand how much it is personally distressing to myself. My friendly\r\nfeelings towards you induce me to express a hope that you may reserve\r\nyourself for the future, and that you will not compromise by false steps\r\nthe talents which may still advantageously serve the King and the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nYou enjoy at present a pension of six thousand francs chargeable on the\r\ndepartment of Foreign Affairs. This allowance will be continued. Rest\r\nassured that I shall be happy, in all that is compatible with my duty,\r\nto afford you proofs of my sincere attachment.\r\n\r\n   DE SERRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. GUIZOT TO M. DE SERRE.\r\n\r\n   _July 17th, 1820._\r\n\r\nI expected your letter; I had reason to foresee it, and I did foresee it\r\nwhen I so loudly declared my disapprobation of the acts and speeches of\r\nthe Ministers. I congratulate myself that I have nothing to change in my\r\nconduct. Tomorrow, as today, I shall belong to myself, and to myself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI have not and I never had any pension or allowance chargeable on the\r\ndepartment of Foreign Affairs. I am therefore not necessitated to\r\ndecline keeping it. I cannot comprehend how your mistake has arisen. I\r\nrequest you to rectify it, as regards yourself and the other Ministers,\r\nfor I cannot suffer such an error to be propagated.\r\n\r\nAccept, I entreat you, the assurance of my respectful consideration.\r\n\r\n   GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. GUIZOT TO THE BARON PASQUIER, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, July 17th, 1820._\r\n\r\nBaron,\r\n\r\nThe Keeper of the Seals, on announcing to me that, in common with\r\nseveral of my friends, I am removed from the Council of State, writes to\r\nme thus: \"You enjoy at present a pension of six thousand francs,\r\nchargeable on the department of Foreign Affairs; this allowance will be\r\ncontinued.\" I have been extremely astonished by this mistake; I am\r\ncompletely ignorant of the cause. I have not and I never had any pension\r\nor allowance of any description chargeable on the department of Foreign\r\nAffairs. Consequently I am not called upon to refuse its continuance. It\r\nwill be very easy for you, Baron, to verify this fact, and I request you\r\nto do so, as well for the Keeper of the Seals as for yourself, for I\r\ncannot suffer the slightest doubt to exist on this subject.\r\n\r\nAccept, etc.\r\n\r\n   GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARON PASQUIER TO M. GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n   _Paris, July 18th, 1820._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have just discovered the cause of the mistake against which you\r\nprotest, and into which I myself led the Keeper of the Seals.\r\n\r\nYour name, in fact, appears in the list of expenses chargeable on my\r\ndepartment, for a sum of 6000 francs. In notifying this charge to me, an\r\nerror was committed in marking it as annual: I therefore considered it\r\nfrom that time in the light of a pension.\r\n\r\nI have now ascertained that it does not assume that character, and that\r\nit related only to a specified sum which had been allowed to you, to\r\nassist in the establishment of a Journal. It was supposed that this\r\nassistance was to be continued, in the form of an annuity, towards\r\ncovering the expenses.\r\n\r\nI shall immediately undeceive the Keeper of the Seals by giving him the\r\ncorrect explanation.\r\n\r\nReceive, I pray you, the assurance of my high consideration.\r\n\r\n   PASQUIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. BERANGER TO M. GUIZOT, MINISTER FOR PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Minister,\r\n\r\nExcuse the liberty I take in recommending to your notice the widow and\r\nchildren of Emile Debraux. You will undoubtedly ask who was this Emile\r\nDebraux. I can inform you, for I have written his panegyric in verse and\r\nin prose. He was a writer of songs. You are too polite to ask me at\r\npresent what a writer of songs is; and I am not sorry, for I should be\r\nconsiderably embarrassed in answering the question. What I can tell you\r\nis, that Debraux was a good Frenchman, who sang against the old\r\nGovernment until his voice was extinguished, and that he died six months\r\nafter the Revolution of July, leaving his family in the most abject\r\npoverty. He was influential with the inferior classes; and you may rest\r\nassured that, as he was not quite as particular as I am in regard to\r\nrhyme and its consequences, he would have sung the new Government, for\r\nhis only directing compass was the tricoloured flag.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have always disavowed the title of a man of letters, as\r\nbeing too ambitious for a mere sonneteer; nevertheless, I am most\r\nanxious that you should consider the widow of Emile Debraux as the widow\r\nof a literary man, for it seems to me that it is only under that title\r\nshe could have any claim to the relief distributed by your department.\r\n\r\nI have already petitioned the Commission of Indemnity for Political\r\nCriminals, in favour of this family. But under the Restoration, Debraux\r\nunderwent a very slight sentence, which gives but a small claim to his\r\nwidow. From that quarter I therefore obtained only a trifle.\r\n\r\nIf I could be fortunate enough to interest you in the fate of these\r\nunfortunate people, I should applaud myself for the liberty I have taken\r\nin advocating their cause. I have been encouraged by the tokens of\r\nkindness you have sometimes bestowed on me.\r\n\r\nI embrace this opportunity of renewing my thanks, and I beg you to\r\nreceive the assurance of the high consideration with which I have the\r\nhonour to remain,\r\n\r\n   Your very humble Servant,\r\n\r\n   BERANGER.\r\n\r\n   _Passy, Feb. 13th, 1834._\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n   JOHN EDWARD TAYLOR, PRINTER,\r\n   LITTLE QUEEN STREET, LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text:\r\n\r\nThe spelling of the name, Chateaubriand, was standardized.\r\n\r\nPage 1: \"MM.
