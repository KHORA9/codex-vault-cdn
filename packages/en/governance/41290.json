Shebanek, William Andrews Clark Memorial Library\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two pieces here reproduced have long been unavailable; their\r\nconnections with Arbuthnot are rather complex. _The Story of the St.\r\nAlb-ns Ghost_ has been ambiguously associated with Arbuthnot since the\r\nyear of its first publication, but it does not seem to have been\r\nreprinted since the nineteenth century when editors regularly included\r\nit among the minor works of Swift. Whoever wrote it, the _Story_ is a\r\nlively and effective Tory squib, whose narrative vigor can carry even\r\nthe twentieth-century reader over the occasional topical obscurities. _A\r\nCatalogue of the ... Library of ... Dr. Arbuthnot_ has never been\r\nreprinted at all, and appears to be unknown by scholars who have thus\r\nfar written about Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost_, the first piece included, has\r\nalways been of doubtful authorship, and must for the present so\r\ncontinue. Two days after the _Story_ first appeared, Swift tantalizingly\r\nwrote to Stella: \"I went to Ld Mashams to night, & Lady Masham made me\r\nread to her a pretty 2 penny Pamphlet calld the St Albans Ghost. I\r\nthought I had writt it my self; so did they, but I did not\" (22 February\r\n1712). Whoever wrote it, the _Story_ succeeded: it was pirated within a\r\nweek, and had reached its third regular \"edition\" within three weeks of\r\nthe first; it appeared in a fifth and apparently final edition on 19\r\nJuly 1712.[1] Now just during these same months Arbuthnot was producing\r\nhis first political satires, five pamphlets later gathered under the\r\ntitle _History of John Bull_. He published the first of these 4 March\r\n1712 and the last 31 July 1712.[2] There are several thematic and\r\nmethodological connections between _The Story of The St. Alb-ns Ghost_\r\nand the John Bull pamphlets: as Tory propaganda pieces, they attack\r\nleading Whigs and make the usual suggestions about irreligion, moral\r\nturpitude and misuse of public funds. Furthermore, they do so by means\r\nof vigorous if sometimes difficult reductive allegories which mock the\r\nvictims by presenting them as farcical figures from low life. The\r\nconnection as well as the difficulties must have appeared quite early,\r\nfor some enterprising publisher (presumably Curll)[3] soon brought out\r\n_A Complete Key to the Three Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the\r\nStory of the St. Alban's Ghost_. Although the exact date of this is not\r\nknown, it must lie between the _termini_ 17 April and 9 May 1712, the\r\ndates of the third and fourth parts respectively of John Bull.\r\nFurthermore, a \"Second Edition Corrected\" of the Key appeared before the\r\npublication of pamphlet four. (The last pages of these two Keys,\r\nconcerning the _Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost_, are reproduced in the\r\nAppendix.) The Key ran through two further editions as _A Complete Key\r\nto the Four Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the Story of the St.\r\nAlban's Ghost_, presumably before 31 July 1712, and came to a fifth\r\n(seemingly last) edition with a more general title referring to \"all\r\nParts\" of John Bull, and still including the _Story_.\r\n\r\nWhile the Keys by association suggest Arbuthnot as author, the only\r\nother contemporary document attributes the _Story_ to a different\r\nphysician and wit: the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr. William\r\nWagstaffe_ (London, 1726) reprint the fourth edition of the Story. Now\r\nthe _Miscellaneous Works_ were printed some five months after the death\r\nof Dr. Wagstaffe and more than three months after that of the supposed\r\neditor Dr. Levett;[4] it is possible that the contents are in part\r\nerroneous. In any case, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and Swift remain the\r\npossible authors with whom scholars must deal until some further\r\nevidence is forthcoming. Roscoe interprets Swift's ambiguous remarks in\r\nthe _Journal to Stella_ as an indirect acknowledgement, and Dilke goes\r\none step further in assuming that the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of\r\nDr. Wagstaffe_ are a mystification, a means for Swift to pass off works\r\nwhich he did not wish to include in the _Miscellanies_ with Pope. Sir\r\nWalter Scott thinks that the _Story_ is probably a collaboration between\r\nArbuthnot and Swift, \"judging from the style\"; Professor Herbert Davis\r\ndissociates Wagstaffe material generally from the writings of Swift, but\r\ndoes not specifically mention the _Story_; however, \"Mr. Granger thought\r\nSt. Alban's Ghost, attributed to Dr. Wagstaffe, was [Arbuthnot's].\"[5]\r\n\r\nAlthough recent scholars seem to agree in selecting Wagstaffe as author\r\nof the _Story_, the evidence of the 1726 _Works_ is implicitly\r\ncontradicted by the Keys. I have made two separate attempts to solve the\r\nquestion of authorship, neither of which has been fully satisfactory.\r\nThe first of these, a computerized test based on the methods of\r\nProfessor Louis T. Milic for distinguishing works by Swift from works by\r\nother authors, has given inconclusive results. In this test the _Story_\r\nwas the chief unknown, and was compared with samples of similar length\r\nfrom Swift, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and, as a control, Mrs. Manley, who\r\nwrote politically keyed narratives but has never been associated with\r\nthe _Story_. The _Story_ turned out to be fairly similar to all four\r\nauthors in the number of different three-word patterns (D), and unlike\r\nall of them in number of Introductory Connectives (IC), where Wagstaffe\r\nstood the highest, and the _Story_ by far the lowest. In the proportion\r\nof Verbals (VB) the _Story_ and Wagstaffe were fairly close together and\r\ndifferent from the other authors tested, who clustered near the Swift\r\nfigures. Thus the test tends to exclude Swift, Arbuthnot and Mrs. Manley\r\nas possible authors, but does not encourage a full confidence in\r\nreplacing them with Wagstaffe. (It also tends to show that some of the\r\nother pieces included in the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr.\r\nWagstaffe_ differ considerably in the usages tested both from one\r\nanother and from the patterns established by the signed works of Dr.\r\nWalstaffe.)[6]\r\n\r\nMy second attempt was based on textual changes among editions of the\r\n_Story_. In the second edition there are three small changes from the\r\nfirst; the third and fourth editions seem to be line-for-line reprints\r\nof the second. (The \"sham, Imperfect Sort\" introduces a large number of\r\nvariants, mainly errors.) In the fifth edition, however, somebody has\r\naltered the typography: many past forms of verbs are altered. Thus at\r\nthe bottom of p. 3 _unbody'd_ becomes _unbodyed_, _carry'd_ and\r\n_deliver'd_ become _carryed_, _delivered_. The task of editing is not\r\ncomplete; particularly near the end of the fifth edition many verbs\r\nstill carry the apostrophe of the earlier editions. The date of the\r\nattempt suggests that Swift's _Proposal for Correcting, Improving and\r\nAscertaining the English Tongue_ (first published 17 May 1712, a week\r\nafter the fourth edition of the _Story_) could have provided the\r\nmotivation, and also that Swift himself could not have been the person\r\nwho made the changes. A study of a few contemporaries shows that Swift\r\nhimself tried to eliminate the apostrophes from the _Conduct of the\r\nAllies_, first published 27 November 1711, and from other works\r\npublished after that date, but not from works published before that\r\ndate. Oldisworth, apparently under the instructions of Swift, tried to\r\ndo the same during the first few months of the _Examiner_, vol. 2\r\n(beginning 6 December 1711), but by the time he reached volume 3,\r\nOldisworth had apparently given up the struggle against unwilling\r\nprinters. Arbuthnot, Roper and Manley are not very interested in the\r\nmatter, and neither are other pamphleteers published by Morphew during\r\nthe months immediately following Swift's _Proposal_. The items included\r\nin the so-called _Miscellaneous Works of Dr. Wagstaffe_, on the other\r\nhand, fall into three groups chronologically: those which precede\r\nSwift's _Proposal_, and include many apostrophied verb forms; those\r\nwhich immediately follow Swift's _Proposal_, and include abnormally few\r\napostrophied verb forms; the two \"late\" pieces (1715, 1719), which are\r\nback to the proportion of apostrophied verbs to be found in the early\r\nitems. If Pseudo-Wagstaffe was indeed a single writer, then he followed\r\nthe same pattern as Oldisworth, but began later and continued longer to\r\nuse verbs with an _-ed_ ending. Since the genuine signed prose works of\r\nDr. Wagstaffe come \"late\" (1717, 1721) and have a fairly large (i.e.,\r\nnormal) number of apostrophied verbs, there is no evidence here as to\r\nwhether or not Pseudo-Wagstaffe is Wagstaffe; at least there is no\r\ncontradiction. In the light of these facts, we can see that neither\r\nSwift nor Arbuthnot is a probable author of the _Story_; Swift would\r\npresumably have altered verb typography in the first and all editions,\r\nand Arbuthnot would not have altered it at all.[7] In these two projects\r\non authorship we find that authors other than Wagstaffe tend to be\r\neliminated, but that Wagstaffe himself is not strongly confirmed. The\r\nauthorship remains as problematic as before, and the _Story_ may as well\r\nfor this century continue with the Arbuthnotiana, as it did during the\r\nnineteenth with the Swiftiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe device of using a ghost story as vehicle for political satire was by\r\n1712 a well-established one. Elias F. Mengel Jr. refers to \"the 'ghost'\r\nconvention, so popular in the Restoration,\"[8] and an important poem of\r\nQueen Anne's reign shows some similarities with and perhaps provided a\r\nmodel for the _Story_. In _Moderation Display'd_ (London, 1705) the\r\nrecently deceased second Earl of Sunderland rises from Hell to confound\r\nhis guilty Whig companions. Tonson (Bibliopolo) is the most terrified,\r\nand as in the _Story_ Wharton (Clodio) is so wicked that he is not\r\nfrightened at all. The _Story_, however, is both more subtle and more\r\nflexible than most other satiric \"ghost\" narratives. It compresses the\r\nactual apparition into the last quarter of the narrative, despite the\r\nperhaps deliberately misleading title. Nearly half of the _Story_ deals\r\nwith previous events; much of the rest is machinery, introduction of\r\nseemingly irrelevant details with a mischievous verisimilitude which\r\nactually advances the main satiric aims. The opening paragraph, for\r\nexample, first denounces Roman Catholic superstition, a denunciation\r\nwhich almost every Englishman could join, and then turns the fire toward\r\n\"Our Sectarists.\" The war on heterodoxy continues in the references to\r\nDr. Garth, the Whig poet and physician noted for his scepticism in\r\nreligion, to William Whiston who during the winter of 1711-1712 was\r\ntranscribing documents and writing elaborate treatises to uphold his\r\nview that Christian churches and theologians had all been essentially\r\nheretical since the time of Athanasius, and to the Reverend and\r\nHonourable Lumley Lloyd, a low-church minister whose sermons attracted\r\nat least two Tory satires.[9] None of these men belongs in the\r\nnarrative, and only Garth was even remotely connected with the\r\nMarlboroughs, but all of them were Whigs, and in various ways serve to\r\n\"demonstrate\" that Whigs must be false brethren to the Church of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThis charge, although a cliché of Tory satires, is here made indirect\r\nand witty, as are the staple charges against the Duke and Duchess of\r\nMarlborough. Whereas, however, the wickedness of nonconformity had been\r\nattacked for decades, the Duke of Marlborough had been associated with\r\nthe Whigs for a relatively short time. As late as 1706 Wagstaffe could\r\ngenerously declare that \"_Woodstock's_ too little\" a reward (_Ramelies,\r\na Poem_), but since Swift's \"Bill of British Ingratitude\" in the\r\n_Examiner_ (17 November 1710) the Tory press had begun to say that the\r\nrewards were too many and too great. The _Story_ repeats the charge that\r\nAvaro and Haggite \"grew Richer than their Mistress\" (p. 11), together\r\nwith the ridiculous insinuations of cowardice and incompetence found\r\nconstantly reiterated in the second volume of _Examiners_. The Duchess\r\nof Marlborough attracted massive satire earlier than her husband, in\r\nsuch books as _The Secret History of Queen Zarah_ (London, 1705),[10]\r\nand her habit of saying \"Lawrd\" with an affected drawl is mentioned in\r\n_The Secret History of Arlus and Odolphus_ (n.p., 1710), pp. 21, 22, 23.\r\n\r\nAlthough not so frequent as attacks on the Duke and Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, attacks on Mrs. Jennings the mother of the Duchess had\r\nalready been made, and indeed the _Story_ relies for part of its effect\r\non the fact that Mrs. Jennings is already associated with witchcraft. In\r\n_Memoirs of Europe_ (London, 1710)[10] for example, she inherits a\r\nfamiliar spirit from Sir Kenelm Digby, there reported the real father of\r\nthe Duchess (II, 44-46). In _Oliver's Pocket Looking-Glass_ (n.p., 1711)\r\nMrs. Jennings appears as \"the famous Mother Shipton, who by the Power\r\nand Influence of her Magick Art, had plac'd a Daughter in the same\r\nStation at Court [i.e., Maid of Honour] with _Meretricia_ [Arabella\r\nChurchill] ...\" (p. 21). Because the author of the Story assumes that\r\nprevious Tory allegations are well-known, he is free to perform elegant\r\nvariations or to allude indirectly. Assuming the fact of witchcraft\r\nallows him to heap up an ambiguous burlesque of popular superstition\r\nwhich is in part entertainment and in part rebuttal of recent Whig\r\nsneers at Tory credulity during the Jane Wenham witch trial.[11] Here as\r\nthroughout the pamphlet, the author demonstrates the virtuosity which\r\neven Swift commends. Since Swift praises few pamphlets except those\r\nwritten by himself and Arbuthnot (or occasionally Mrs. Manley), the\r\n_Story_ enters a fairly select company. It is the only Pseudo-Wagstaffe\r\npiece mentioned by name in the _Journal to Stella_, the only one found\r\nworthy to stand beside the productions of Swift and Arbuthnot.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second document reproduced claims to be _A Catalogue of the Capital\r\nand Well-Known Library of Books, of the Late Celebrated Dr. Arbuthnot_.\r\nTo the extent that the claim is true, the _Catalogue_ will be important\r\nfor studies of the Scriblerian Club generally, since Arbuthnot is the\r\nmember with the greatest reputation for learning. Although the contents\r\nof a man's library do not correspond exactly with the contents of his\r\nmind, scholars can discover a good deal about the intellectual methods\r\nof Dr. Arbuthnot by examining the books which he owned. Until now this\r\nhas not been possible; the _Catalogue_ is a recent acquisition of the\r\nBritish Museum, not so much as mentioned in books thus far published\r\nabout Arbuthnot. For several reasons, however, the document must be used\r\nwith caution. First of all, the compilers list a total of 2525 volumes,\r\nbut they itemize only 1639,[13] and even then often give inadequate\r\ninformation. Furthermore, a xerox copy of the Sale Book records of the\r\nauction, very kindly sent to me by the present Messrs. Christie, Manson\r\nand Woods, shows that almost a quarter of the lots (items 53-65,\r\n243-245, 276-372, 426), or 999 volumes, belonged not to the Arbuthnot\r\nestate but to other owners. Finally, Dr. Arbuthnot died in 1735, whereas\r\nthe auction was not held until December 1779, about three and a half\r\nmonths after the death of his bachelor son George. Of the books\r\nbelonging to the Arbuthnot estate, almost 20% were printed after 1735,\r\nand belonged not to the father but to the son, or perhaps in some cases\r\nto the daughter Anne, who lived with her brother.[14] The legal books\r\nare likely all to have been George Arbuthnot's, and presumably some of\r\nthe other books printed before 1735 also. Despite these obscurities, the\r\nCatalogue throws a good deal of new light upon the most learned\r\nScriblerian--and upon his family.\r\n\r\nDr. Arbuthnot seems to have bought relatively few antiquarian books;\r\nabout 20% of the itemized volumes belonging to his estate come before\r\n1691, the year when he first went to London. In selecting these older\r\nworks Arbuthnot has shown a catholic taste and linguistic ability: he\r\nbought grammars and dictionaries, besides works on medicine and science,\r\nliterature, history and religion, written in English, French, Italian,\r\nLatin and Greek, plus a solitary Hebrew Bible (item 234); his copy of\r\nUdall's _Key to the Holy Tongue_ is dated 1693 (item 183). Less than a\r\nquarter of these earlier books are in English. The sole \"cradle\" date of\r\nthe catalogue, 1495 for _Rosa Anglica_ (item 417), may be a misprint:\r\neditions of 1492 and 1595, among others, have been previously recorded,\r\nbut none for 1495.[15]\r\n\r\nWhen compared with the antiquarian books, the list of titles from the\r\nArbuthnot estate either dated or first published after the death of Dr.\r\nArbuthnot reveals a number of differences. English is the predominant\r\nlanguage of the late group, with French a poor second. There is another\r\nHebrew Bible (253), a Spanish Cervantes (25), an Italian Machiavelli\r\n(96), but no Greek book at all, and astonishingly only two Latin: a\r\ndictionary (89) and a Horace (147); Cicero appears in a French\r\ntranslation (26). In part, of course, the shift in languages accompanies\r\nthe general decline of humanistic learning in the eighteenth century,\r\nbut it also strengthens our knowledge of Dr. Arbuthnot's erudition.\r\nAlthough apparently not interested in science, George Arbuthnot read\r\nwidely, however, in other areas (see for example 10, 15, 49, 158, 160,\r\n168, 170, 254, 271). Similarly, the books from outside the Arbuthnot\r\nestate are less learned than those of Arbuthnot. They do include two\r\nGreek testaments (290, 310) and some recent scientific works (e.g. 314,\r\n*349), but lack the great Greek writers whom Arbuthnot collected, such\r\nas Plato (125), Aristotle (126), Herodotus (385) or Aristophanes (387).\r\nWhereas Arbuthnot read Newton's treatises (81, 85, 197, 217), one of the\r\nother owners read Algarotti's simplification (*312).\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the books in the Arbuthnot estate can be variously\r\ndivided. By sheer number of titles, literature is the most important\r\nsubject, closely followed by science (including medicine as the biggest\r\nsub-group), and then by history. In number of volumes, however, the\r\nhistorical section is considerably larger than the literary, and science\r\ncomes third. Books on geography and travel, philosophical treatises,\r\ngrammars and dictionaries, even a work on astrology (109), attest to the\r\nbreadth of Arbuthnot's interests. A few works in the fine arts are\r\nlisted, somewhat surprisingly only two of them on music (32, 373). The\r\nmilitary item (391) may come from the Doctor's brother George, who was\r\nin the army, or it may represent another aspect of the general interest\r\nin all human affairs. There is a fairly large number of religious works,\r\nincluding books by Eusebius and Sozomen (127), Spotswood (380), Huet\r\n(383), Charles Leslie (251), Leibniz (141), Tillotson (395) and Jeremy\r\nTaylor (3,394). The elaborately bound Greek Septuagint (272) and Greek\r\nNew Testament (273) must be the ones which Arbuthnot specified in his\r\nwill (the only books there mentioned), calling them \"the Gift of my late\r\nRoyal Mistress Queen Anne.\"[16] As the _Catalogue_ does not describe\r\nany other fine bindings, the other books seem to have been bought for\r\nuse rather than for show.\r\n\r\nA study of the duplications among the books in the Arbuthnot estate\r\nreinforces the opinion that the books were bought for use. The only\r\nitems appearing three times are the works of Pope (76, 180) and Pope's\r\n_Iliad_ (11, 77, 242). Since two of the former were published after the\r\ndeath of Arbuthnot, and must have belonged to the Arbuthnot children,\r\nperhaps the extra _Iliads_ were equally the property of Arbuthnot's\r\nheirs. The duplicates of Molière (21, 135), Prideaux (50, 379), and\r\nVeneroni (90, *229) could also have belonged to the children. However,\r\nthe bulk of the duplications seem to involve obtaining a later edition\r\nor a necessary text, and thus to have a scholarly rationale. For\r\nexample, the two editions of Eustachius are dated 1714, 1728 (115, 259),\r\nthose of Livy are dated 1578, 1708 (7, 386), while both sets of\r\nSennertus seem to be broken (406, 407).\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, Arbuthnot owned a number of satirical works. In\r\naddition to Pope and Molière, already mentioned, he owned Petronius (9),\r\nJuvenal and Persius (230), Terence (231), Plautus (232), Boileau (98),\r\nGay (79) and Swift's _Tale of a Tub_ (178). He presumably bought or was\r\ngiven other works by Swift, but no others are itemized; perhaps some\r\nwere in the \"Large parcel of pamphlets\" (1). George Arbuthnot added a\r\ncopy of _The Four Last Years of Queen Anne_ (173), not published until\r\n1758.\r\n\r\nAlthough literature bulks large among Arbuthnot's books, English poetry\r\nis not very conspicuous. According to some of the dates, Arbuthnot may\r\nhave developed his interest in English poetry rather late in life.\r\nAlthough he owned a 1611 Spenser (423), he did not buy the listed\r\nChaucer (110) until 1721. Pope may have inspired the urge to acquire\r\nMilton (80, 185), but there seems to be no literary reason for wanting a\r\nMilton in French (184). Some other member of the family was, however,\r\nsufficiently interested in Milton to buy Newton's edition in 1749 (78).\r\nThe minor poets listed are also late in date (72, 187). The only Dryden\r\nis the translation of Virgil (16), which could represent an interest in\r\nclassical just as much as in English poetry. There are, however, two\r\ncopies of Prior's _Poems_ in the large paper edition (106, 252). As the\r\ncompilers of the _Catalogue_ have left many volumes unspecified, there\r\nmust have been other poetic works, but the listed sample is rather\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nCharacteristically uninterested in his personal fame, Arbuthnot kept no\r\ncopies of his own writings except the reissued _Tables of Ancient Coins_\r\n(84, 193), associated with a favorite son. The reader revealed by this\r\nlibrary is the same Arbuthnot whom his contemporaries admired: witty,\r\nyet thoughtful and religious; deeply learned, yet modest. His children,\r\nalthough less learned than the father, continued to buy books on current\r\ntopics, particularly literature, history and travel. Aged over seventy,\r\nGeorge Arbuthnot was still ingesting such materials as Laughton's\r\n_History of Ancient Egypt_ (168) and Raynal's comprehensive history of\r\ncolonialism (10). Despite the obscurity of the word \"more\" under which\r\nthe compilers listed half of the total volumes, even the sample of the\r\nlibrary is a welcome addition to our knowledge about Dr. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Victoria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See advertisements in the _Evening Post_, 19, 21, 26 February, 13\r\nMarch 1712; and in the _Post-Boy_, 10 May and 19 July 1712.\r\n\r\nThe research necessary for the present publication was supported by a\r\ngrant from the University of Victoria and by a Leave Fellowship from the\r\nCanada Council.\r\n\r\n[2] The dates given by Professor H. Teerink in _The History of John Bull\r\nfor the first time faithfully re-issued from the original pamphlets_\r\n(Amsterdam, 1925), pp. 6-7, are drawn from dates in the Examiner, a\r\nweekly newspaper. Three of these dates are correct, and the other two\r\nare close, but can be corrected by consulting papers published more\r\noften.

ALB-NS GHOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can scarcely say whether we ought to attribute the Multitude of Ghosts\r\nand Apparitions, which were so common in the Days of our Forefathers, to\r\nthe Ignorance of the People, or the Impositions of the Priest. The\r\nRomish Clergy found it undoubtedly for their Interest to deceive them,\r\nand the Superstition of the People laid themselves open to receive\r\nwhatsoever They thought proper to inculcate. Hence it is, that their\r\nTraditions are little else, than the Miracles and Atchievements of\r\nunbody'd Heroes, a Sort of spiritual Romance, so artfully carry'd on,\r\nand delivered in so probable a Manner, as may easily pass for Truth on\r\nthose of an uncultivated Capacity, or a credulous Disposition. Our\r\nSectarists indeed still retain the Credulity, as well as some of the\r\nTenets of that Church; and Apparitions, and such like, are still the\r\nBug-bears made use of by some of the most Celebrated of their\r\nHolders-forth to terrify the old Women of their Congregation, (who are\r\ntheir surest Customers) and enlarge their Quarterly Subscriptions. I\r\nknow one of these Ambidexters, who never fails of Ten or Twenty Pounds\r\nmore than Ordinary, by nicking _something Wonderful_ in due Time; he\r\noften cloaths his whole Family _by the Apparition of a Person lately\r\nexecuted at_ Tyburn; or, _a Whale seen at_ Greenwich, _or thereabouts_;\r\nand I am credibly inform'd, that his Wife has made a Visit with a Brand\r\nnew Sable Tippet on, since the Death of the _Tower Lions_.\r\n\r\nBut as these Things will pass upon none but the Ignorant or\r\nSuperstitious, so there are others that will believe nothing of this\r\nNature, even upon the clearest Evidence. There are, it must be own'd,\r\nbut very few of these Accounts to be depended on; some however are so\r\npalpable, and testify'd by so good Authority, by those of such undoubted\r\nCredit, and so discerning a Curiosity, that there is no Room to doubt of\r\ntheir Veracity, and which none but a Sceptic can disbelieve. Such is the\r\nfollowing Story of Mother _Haggy_ of St. _Alb----ns_, in the Reign of\r\nKing _James_ the First, the mighty Pranks she plaid in her Life-time,\r\nand her Apparition afterwards, made such a Noise, both at Home and\r\nAbroad, and were so terrible to the Neighbourhood, that the Country\r\nPeople, to this Day, cannot hear the Mention of her Name, without the\r\nmost dismal Apprehensions. The Injuries they receiv'd from the Sorceries\r\nand Incantations of the Mother, and the Injustice and Oppression of the\r\nSon and Daughter, have made so deep an Impression upon their Minds, and\r\nbegot such an Hereditary Aversion to their Memory, that they never speak\r\nof them, without the bitterest Curses and Imprecations.\r\n\r\nI have made it my Business, being at St. _Alb----ns_ lately, to enquire\r\nmore particularly into this Matter, and the Helps I have receiv'd from\r\nthe _most noted Men of Erudition in this City, have been Considerable_,\r\nand to whom I make my publick Acknowledgment. The Charges I have been at\r\nin _getting Manuscripts_, and Labour in _collating them_, the\r\nReconciling the Disputes about the most _material Circumstances_, and\r\nadjusting the _various Readings_, as they have took me up a considerable\r\nTime, so I hope they may be done to the Satisfaction of my Reader. I\r\nwish I could have had Time to have distinguish'd by an Asterism the\r\nCircumstances deliver'd by Tradition only, from those of the\r\nManuscripts, which I was advis'd to do by my worthy Friend the Reverend\r\nMr. _Wh----n_, who, had he not been _Employ'd otherways_, might have\r\nbeen a very proper Person to have undertaken such a Performance.\r\n\r\nThe best Manuscripts are now in the Hands of the Ingenious Dr.\r\n_G----th_, where they are left for the Curious to peruse, and where any\r\n_Clergyman_ may be welcome; for however he may have been abus'd by\r\nthose who deny him to be the Author of the _D----y_, and tax'd by others\r\nwith Principles and Practices unbecoming a Man of his Sense and Probity,\r\nyet I will be bold to say in his Defence, that I believe he is as good a\r\nChristian, as he is a Poet, and if he publishes any Thing on the late\r\nD----d _M----y_, I don't question but it will be interspers'd with as\r\nmany Precepts of Reveal'd Religion, as the Subject is capable of\r\nbearing: And it is very probable, those _Refin'd Pieces_ that the Doctor\r\nhas been pleas'd to own, since the Writing of the _D----y_, have been\r\nlook'd upon, by the lewd debauch'd Criticks of the Town, to be dull and\r\ninsipid, for no other Reason, but because they are grave and sober; but\r\nthis I leave for others to determine, and can say for his Sincerity,\r\nthat I am assur'd he believes the following Relation as much as any of\r\nus all.\r\n\r\nMother _Haggy_ was marry'd to a plain home-spun Yeoman of St.\r\n_Alb----ns_, and liv'd in good Repute for some Years: The Place of her\r\nBirth is disputed by some of the most celebrated Moderns, tho' they have\r\na Tradition in the Country, that she was never Born at all, and which is\r\nmost probable. At the Birth of her Daughter _Haggite_, something\r\nhappen'd very remarkable, and which gave Occasion to the Neighbourhood\r\nto mistrust she had a Correspondence with _Old Nick_, as was confirm'd\r\nafterwards, beyond the Possibility of Disproof. The Neighbours were got\r\ntogether a Merry-making, as they term it, in the Country, when the old\r\nWoman's High-crown'd Hat, that had been thrown upon the Bed's Tester\r\nduring the Heat of the Engagement, leap'd with a wonderful Agility into\r\nthe Cradle, and being catch'd at by the Nurse, was metamorphos'd into a\r\nCoronet, which according to her Description, was not much unlike that of\r\na _German_ Prince; but it soon broke into a thousand Pieces. _Such_,\r\ncries old Mother _Haggy, will be the Fortune of my Daughter, and such\r\nher Fall_. The Company took but little Notice what she said, being\r\nsurpris'd at the Circumstance of the Hat. _But this is Fact_, says the\r\nReverend and Honourable L----y _L----d_, _and my Grandmother, who was a\r\nPerson of Condition, told me_, says He, _she knew the Man, who knew the\r\nWoman, who was_, said she, _in the Room at that Instant_. The very same\r\nNight, I saw a Comet, neither have I any Occasion to tell a Lye as to\r\nthis Particular, _says my Author_, brandishing its Tail in a very\r\nsurprising Manner in the Air, but upon the Breaking of a Cloud, I could\r\ndiscern, _continues he_, a Clergyman at the Head of a Body of his own\r\nCloth, and follow'd by an innumerable Train of Laity, who coming towards\r\nthe Comet, it disappear'd.\r\n\r\nThis was the first Time Mother _Haggy_ became suspected, and it was the\r\nOpinion of the Wisest of the Parish, that they should Petition the King\r\nto send her to be try'd for a Witch by the _Presbytery of Scotland_. How\r\nthis past off I cannot tell, but certain it is, that some of the Great\r\nOnes of the Town were in with her, and 'tis said she was Serviceable to\r\nthem in their Amours: She had a Wash that would make the Skin of a\r\nBlackamore as white as Alabaster, and another, that would restore the\r\nLoss of a Maidenhead, _without any Hindrance of Business, or the\r\nKnowledge of any one about them_. She try'd this Experiment so often\r\nupon her Daughter _Haggite_, that more than Twenty were satisfy'd they\r\nhad her Virginity before Marriage.\r\n\r\nShe soon got such a Reputation all about the Country, that there was not\r\na Cow, a Smock, or a silver Spoon lost, but they came to her to enquire\r\nafter it; All the young People flock'd to have their Fortunes told,\r\nwhich, they say she never miss'd. She told _Haggite_'s Husband, he\r\nshould grow Rich, and be a Great Man, but by his Covetousness and\r\nGriping of the Poor, should come to an ill End. All which happen'd so\r\nexactly, _That there are several old Folks in our Town, who can remember\r\nit, as if it was but Yesterday_.\r\n\r\nShe has been often seen to ride full gallop upon a Broom-Stick at\r\nNoon-Day, and swim over a River in a Kettle-Drum. Sometimes she wou'd\r\nappear in the Shape of a Lioness, and at other times of a Hen, or a Cat;\r\nbut I have heard, could not turn herself into a Male Creature, or walk\r\nover two Straws across. There were never known so many great Winds as\r\nabout that Time, or so much Mischief done by them: The Pigs gruntled,\r\nand the Screech-Owls hooted oftner than usual; a Horse was found dead\r\none Morning with Hay in his Mouth; and a large overgrown Jack was caught\r\nin a Fish-Pond thereabouts with a silver Tobacco-Box in his Belly;\r\nseveral Women were brought to Bed of two Children, Some miscarry'd, and\r\nold Folks died very frequently.\r\n\r\nThese Things could not chuse but breed a great Combustion in the Town,\r\nas they call it, and every Body certainly had rejoyc'd at her Death,\r\nhad she not been succeeded by a Son and Daughter, who, tho' they were no\r\nConjurers, were altogether as terrible to the Neighbourhood. She had two\r\nDaughters, one of which was marry'd to a Man who went beyond Sea; the\r\nother, her Daughter _Haggite_, to _Avaro_, whom we shall have Occasion\r\nto mention in the Sequel of this Story.\r\n\r\nThere liv'd at that Time in the Neighbourhood two Brothers, of a great\r\nFamily, Persons of a vast Estate and Character, and extreamly kind to\r\ntheir Servants and Dependants. _Haggite_ by her Mother's Interest, was\r\ngot into this Family, and _Avaro_, who was afterwards her Husband, was\r\nthe Huntsman's Boy. He was a Lad of a fine Complexion, good Features,\r\nand agreeable to the fair Sex, but wanted the Capacity of some of his\r\nfellow Servants: Tho' he got a Reputation afterwards for a Man of\r\nCourage, but upon no other Grounds, than by setting the Country Fellows\r\nto Cudgelling or Boxing, and being a Spectator of a broken Head and a\r\nbloody Nose.\r\n\r\nThere are several authentic Accounts of the Behaviour of these Two, in\r\ntheir respective Stations, and by what Means they made an Advancement of\r\ntheir Fortunes. There are several Relations, I say, now extant, that\r\ntell us, how one of these great Brothers took _Avaro_'s Sister for his\r\nMistress, which was the Foundation of his Preferment, and how _Haggite_,\r\nby granting her Favours to any one who would go to the Expence of them,\r\nbecame extreamly Wealthy, and how Both had gain'd the Art of getting\r\nMoney out of every Body they had to do with, and by the most\r\ndishonourable Methods. Never perhaps, was any Couple so match'd in\r\nevery Thing as these, or so fit for one another: A Couple so link'd by\r\nthe Bonds of Iniquity, as well as Marriage, that it is impossible to\r\ntell which had the greatest Crimes to answer for.\r\n\r\nIt will be needless to relate the Fortune of the Brothers, who were\r\ntheir Successive Masters, and the Favours they bestow'd on them. It is\r\nsufficient that the Estate came at last to a Daughter of the younger\r\nBrother, a Lady, who was the Admiration of the Age she liv'd in, and the\r\nDarling of the whole Country, and who had been attended from her Infancy\r\nby _Haggite_.\r\n\r\nThen it was _Avaro_ began his Tyranny; he was entrusted with all the\r\nAffairs of Consequence, and there was nothing done without his\r\nKnowledge. He marry'd his Daughters to some of the most considerable\r\nEstates in the Neighbourhood, and was related by Marriage to one\r\n_Baconface_, a sort of Bailiff to his Lady. He, and _Baconface_ and\r\n_Haggite_ got into Possession, as it were, of their Lady's Estate, and\r\ncarry'd it with so high a Hand, were so haughty to the Rich, and\r\noppressive to the Poor, that they quickly began to make themselves\r\nodious; but for their better Security, they form'd a sort of Confederacy\r\nwith one _Dammyblood_, _Clumzy_ their Son-in-Law, _Splitcause_ an\r\nAttorney, and _Mouse_ a noted Ballad-Maker, and some others. As soon as\r\nthey had done this, they began so to domineer, that there was no Living\r\nfor those who would not compliment, or comply with them in their\r\nVillany. _Haggite_ cry'd, _Lord, Madam_, to her Mistress, _It must be\r\nso_; _Avaro_ swore, _By_ G----d, and _Baconface_ shook his Head, and\r\nlook'd dismally. They made every Tenant pay a Tax, and every Servant\r\nconsiderably out of his Wages toward the Mounding their Lady's Estate,\r\nas they pretended, but most part of it went into their own Pockets. Once\r\nupon a Time, the Tenants grumbling at their Proceedings, _Clumzy_, the\r\nSon-in-Law, brought in a Parcel of Beggars to settle upon the Estate.\r\nThus they liv'd for some Years, till they grew Richer than their\r\nMistress, and were, perhaps, the Richest Servants in the World: Nay,\r\nwhat is the most Remarkable, and will scarcely find Belief in future\r\nAges, they began at last to deny her Title to the Estate, and affirm,\r\nshe held it only by their Permission and Connivance.\r\n\r\nThings were come to this pass, when one of the Tenants Sons from\r\n_Oxf----rd_ preach'd up Obedience to their Lady, and the Necessity of\r\ntheir Downfall, who oppos'd it. This open'd the Eyes of all the honest\r\nTenants, but enrag'd _Avaro_ and his Party, to that Degree, that they\r\nhad hir'd a Pack of Manag'd Bull-Dogs, with a Design to bait him, and\r\nhad done it infallibly, had not the Gentry interpos'd, and the Country\r\nPeople run into his Assistance. These, with much ado, muzled the Dogs,\r\nand petition'd their Lady to discard the Mismanagers, who consented to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nGreat were the Endeavours, and great the Struggles of the Faction, for\r\nso they were call'd, to keep themselves in Power, as the Histories of\r\nthose Times mention. They stirr'd up all their Ladies Acquaintance to\r\nspeak to her in their behalf, wrote Letters to and fro, swore and\r\ncurs'd, laugh'd and cry'd, told the most abominable and inconsistent\r\nLyes, but all to no Purpose: They spent their Money, lavish'd away their\r\nBeef, Pudding, and _October_, most unmercifully, and made several\r\n_Jointed-Babies_ to shew for Sights, and please the Tenants Sons about\r\n_Christmas_.\r\n\r\nOld _Drybones_ was then the Parson of the Parish, a Man of the most\r\nnotorious Character, who would change his Principles at any Time to\r\nserve a Turn, preach or pray _Extempore_, talk Nonsense, or any Thing\r\nelse, for the Advancement of _Avaro_ and his Faction. He was look'd upon\r\nto be the greatest Artist in _Legerdemain_ in that Country; and had a\r\nWay of shewing the Pope and little Master in a Box, but the Figures were\r\nso very small, it was impossible for any Body but himself to discern\r\nthem. He was hir'd, as is suppos'd, to tax the New Servants with Popery,\r\ntogether with their Mistress, which he preach'd in several Churches\r\nthereabouts; but his Character was too well known to make any Thing\r\ncredited that came from him.\r\n\r\nThere are several Particulars related, both by Tradition and the\r\nManuscripts, concerning the turning out of these Servants, which\r\nwould require greater Volumes than I design. It is enough, that\r\nnotwithstanding their Endeavours, they were Discarded, and the Lady\r\nchose her new Servants out of the most honest and substantial of her\r\nTenants, of undoubted Abilities, who were tied to her by Inclination as\r\nwell as Duty. These began a Reformation of all the Abuses committed by\r\n_Avaro_ and _Baconface_, which discover'd such a Scene of Roguery to\r\nthe World, that one would hardly think the most mercenary Favourites\r\ncould be guilty of.\r\n\r\n_Avaro_ now began to be very uneasie, and to be affrighted at his own\r\nConscience; he found nothing would pacifie the enrag'd Tenants, and that\r\nhis Life wou'd be but a sufficient Recompence for his Crimes. His Money\r\nwhich he rely'd on, and which he lavish'd away to Bribe off his\r\nDestruction, had not Force enough to Protect him: He could not, as it is\r\nreported, Sit still in one Place for two Minutes, never Slept at all,\r\nEat little or nothing, Talk'd very rambling and inconsistent, of\r\n_Merit_, _Hardships_, _Accounts_, _Perquisites_, _Commissioners_,\r\n_Bread_ and _Bread-Waggons_, but was never heard to mention any\r\n_Cheese_.\r\n\r\nHe came and made a Confession in his own House to some People he never\r\nsaw before in his Life, and which shews no little Disorder in his Brain;\r\n_That, whatever they might think of him, he was as Dutiful a Servant as\r\nany his Mistress had_. _Haggite_ rav'd almost as bad as he, and had got\r\nSt. _Anthony's Fire_ in her Face; but it is a question, says Dr.\r\n_G--th_, whether there was any Thing Ominous in that, since it is\r\nprobable, the Distemper only chang'd it's Situation.\r\n\r\nMean while, it was agreed by _Baconface_ and others, that a Consultation\r\nshould be call'd at _Avaro_'s House, something Decisive resolv'd on, in\r\norder to prevent their Ruin; and accordingly _Jacobo_ the Messenger was\r\nsent to inform the Cabal of it.\r\n\r\nDismal and horrid was the Night of that infernal Consultation, nothing\r\nheard but the melancholly Murmuring of Winds, and the Croaking of Toads\r\nand Ravens; Every thing seem'd Wild and Desert, and double Darkness\r\noverspread the Hemisphere: Thunder and Lightning, Storms and Tempest,\r\nand Earthquakes, seem'd to Presage something more then Ordinary, and\r\nadded to the Confusion of that Memorable Night. Nature sicken'd, and\r\ngroan'd, as it were, under the Tortures of universal Ruine. Not a\r\nServant in the House but had Dreamt the strangest Dreams, and _Haggite_\r\nher self had seen a Stranger in the Candle. The Fire languish'd and\r\nburnt Blue, and the Crickets sung continually about the Oven: How far\r\nthe Story is true concerning the Warming-Pan and Dishes, I cannot say,\r\nbut certain it is, a Noise was heard like that of rolling Pease from the\r\ntop of the House to the bottom; and the Windows creak'd, and the Doors\r\nrattled in a manner not a little terrible. Several of their Servants\r\nmade Affidavit, That _Haggite_ lost a red Petticoat, a Ruff, and a Pair\r\nof Green-Stockings, that were her Mother's, but the Night before, and a\r\nDiamond-Cross once gave her by a _Great Man_.\r\n\r\n'Twas about Midnight before this Black Society got together, and no\r\nsooner were they seated, when _Avaro_ open'd to them in this manner. We\r\nhave try'd, _says he_, my Friends, all the Artifices we cou'd invent or\r\nexecute, but all in vain. Our Mistress has discover'd plainly our\r\nIntentions, and the Tenants will be neither flatter'd, nor frighted, nor\r\nbrib'd into our Interest. It remains therefore, and what tho' we Perish\r\nin the Attempt, we must Perish otherwise, that once for all we make a\r\nPush at the very Life of----When, Lo! _says the Manuscript_, An unusual\r\nNoise interrupted his Discourse, and _Jacobo_ cry'd out, _The Devil, the\r\nDevil at the Door_. Scarce had he Time to speak, or they to listen, when\r\nthe Apparition of Mother _Haggy_ entred; But, Who can describe the\r\nAstonishment they were then in? _Haggite_ sounded away in the\r\nElbow-Chair as she sat, and _Avaro_, notwithstanding his boasted\r\nCourage, slunk under the Table in an Instant: _Baconface_ screw'd\r\nhimself into a thousand Postures; and _Clumzy_ trembled till his very\r\nWater trickled from him. _Splitcause_ tumbled over a Joint-Stool, and\r\n_Mouse_ the Ballad-Maker broke a Brandy-Bottle that had been _Haggite_'s\r\nCompanion for some Years: But _Dammyblood, Dammyblood_ only was the Man\r\nthat had the Courage to cry out G-d D-m your Bl--d, What occasion\r\nfor all this Bustle? Is it not the Devil, and is he not our old\r\nAcquaintance? This reviv'd them in some Measure; but the Ghastlyness of\r\nthe Spectacle made still some Impression on them. There was an\r\nunaccountable Irregularity in her Dress, a Wanness in her Complexion,\r\nand a Disproportion in her Features. Flames of Fire issued from her\r\nNostrils, and a sulphurous Smoak from her Mouth, which together with the\r\nCondition some of the Company were in, made a very noisome and offensive\r\nSmell; and _I have been told_, says a very Grave Alderman of _St.\r\nAlbans, Some of them saw her Cloven Foot_.\r\n\r\nI Come, _says she_, at length, (in an hollow Voice, more terrible than\r\nthe celebrated Stentor, or the brawny _Caledonian_) I Come, O ye\r\nAccomplices in Iniquity, to tell you of your Crimes, to bid you desist\r\nfrom these Cabals, for they are Fruitless, and prepare for Punishment\r\nthat is Certain. I have, as long as I could, assisted you in your\r\nGlorious Execrable Attempts, but Time is now no more; the Time is coming\r\nwhen you must be deliver'd up to Justice. As to you, O Son and Daughter,\r\n_said she_, turning to them, 'tis but a few revolving Moons, e'er you\r\nmust both fall a Sacrifice to your Avarice and Ambition, as I have told\r\nyou heretofore, but your Mistress will be too Merciful, and tho' your\r\nready Money must be refunded, your Estate in Land will Descend onto your\r\nHeirs. But you, O _Baconface_, you have Merited nothing to save either\r\nyour Life or your Estate, be contented therefore with the Loss of both:\r\nAnd _Clumzy, says she_, you must have the same Fate, your Insolence to\r\nyour Lady, and the Beggars you brought in upon the Tenants will require\r\nit. _Dammyblood, continues she_, turning towards him, you must expect a\r\nconsiderable Fine; but _Splitcause_ and _Mouse_ may come off more\r\neasily. She said, gave a Shriek; and disappear'd; and the Cabal\r\ndispers'd with the utmost Consternation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A\r\n CATALOGUE\r\n OF THE CAPITAL AND WELL-KNOWN\r\n LIBRARY of BOOKS,\r\n OF\r\n THE LATE CELEBRATED\r\n Dr. ARBUTHNOT,\r\n DECEASED;\r\n\r\n Which will be Sold by AUCTION,\r\n By Mess.
