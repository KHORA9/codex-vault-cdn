The United States is\r\nhappily among those countries in which the phenomenon can be observed,\r\nand we have witnessed in recent times not only the organization of\r\nsocieties and the establishment of journals designed to foster\r\nresearch within the field, but also a notable multiplication and\r\nstrengthening of courses in political science open to students in our\r\ncolleges and universities, as well as the development of clubs,\r\nforums, extension courses, and other facilities for the increasing of\r\npolitical information and the stimulation of political thinking on the\r\npart of the people at large. It is the object of this book to promote\r\nthe intelligent study of government by supplying working descriptions\r\nof the governmental systems of the various countries of western and\r\ncentral Europe as they have taken form and as they operate at the\r\npresent day. Conceived and prepared primarily as a text for use in\r\ncollege courses, it is hoped none the less that the volume may prove\r\nof service to persons everywhere whose interest in the subject leads\r\nthem to seek the sort of information which is here presented.\r\n\r\nThe content of the book has been determined, in the main, by three\r\nconsiderations. In the first place, it has been deemed desirable to\r\nafford a wide opportunity for the _comparative_ study of political\r\ninstitutions, especially by reason of the familiar fact that the\r\ngovernmental system of a minor country may, and frequently does,\r\nexhibit elements of novelty and of importance not inferior to those to\r\nbe observed in the political organization of a greater state. Hence\r\nthere are included descriptions of the governments of the minor as\r\nwell as of the major nations of western and central Europe; and the\r\noriginal purpose to attempt some treatment of the governments of the\r\neastern nations has been abandoned, somewhat reluctantly, only because\r\nof the demands of space, and because it was felt that this portion of\r\nthe projected work would perhaps meet no very serious need in the\r\nusual college courses. In the second place, it is believed that the\r\nintelligent study of present-day governments must involve at all  (p. viii)\r\nstages the taking into careful account of the historical origins and\r\ngrowth of these governments. Hence a considerable amount of space has\r\nbeen devoted to sketches of constitutional history, which, however,\r\nare in all instances so arranged that they may readily be omitted if\r\ntheir omission is deemed desirable. In the case of countries whose\r\npolitical system underwent a general reconstitution during the\r\nRevolutionary and Napoleonic era it has been thought not feasible to\r\nallude, even briefly, to historical developments prior to the later\r\neighteenth century. In the third place, it has been considered\r\ndesirable to include in the book some treatment of political parties\r\nand of the institutions of local administration.\r\n\r\nWithin a field so expansive it has been possible to undertake but an\r\nintroduction to a majority of the subjects touched upon. In the\r\nfoot-notes will be found references to books, documents, and\r\nperiodical materials of widely varying types, and it is hoped that\r\nsome of these may serve to guide student and reader to more intensive\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the book has been facilitated by the encouragement\r\nand the expert advice accorded me by a number of teachers of\r\ngovernment in colleges and universities in various portions of the\r\ncountry. And I have had at all times the patient and discriminating\r\nassistance of my wife. For neither the plan nor the details of the\r\nwork, however, can responsibility be attached to anyone save myself. I\r\ncan only hope that amidst the multitude of facts, some elusive and\r\nmany subject to constant change, which I have attempted here to set\r\ndown, not many seriously vitiating errors may have escaped detection.\r\n\r\n                                        Frederic Austin OGG.\r\n  Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\n  January 10, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS                                                   (p. ix)\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.--GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n       I.

THE IMPORTANCE OF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n*1. Political Pre-eminence of Great Britain.*--George III. is reported\r\nto have pronounced the English constitution the most perfect of human\r\nformations. One need hardly concur unreservedly in this dictum to be\r\nimpressed with the propriety of beginning a survey of the governmental\r\nsystems of modern Europe with an examination of the political\r\nprinciples, rules, and practices of contemporary Britain. The history\r\nof no other European nation, in the first place, exhibits a\r\ndevelopment of institutions so prolonged, so continuous, and so\r\norderly. The governmental forms and agencies of no other state have\r\nbeen studied with larger interest or imitated with clearer effect. The\r\npublic policy of no other organized body of men has been more\r\ninfluential in shaping the progress, social and economic as well as\r\npolitical, of the civilized world. For the American student,\r\nfurthermore, the approach to the institutions of the European\r\ncontinent is likely to be rendered easier and more inviting if made by\r\nway of a body of institutions which lies at the root of much that is\r\nboth American and continental. There are, it is true, not a few\r\nrespects in which the governmental system of the United States to-day\r\nbears closer resemblance to that of France, Germany, Switzerland, or\r\neven Italy than to that of Great Britain. The relation, however,\r\nbetween the British and the American is one, in the main, of\r\nhistorical continuity, while that between the French or German and the\r\nAmerican is one which arises largely from mere imitation or from\r\naccidental resemblance.\r\n\r\n*2. The Continuity of Institutional History.*--No government can be\r\nstudied adequately apart from the historical development which has (p. 002)\r\nmade it what it is; and this ordinarily means the tracing of origins\r\nand of changes which stretch through a prolonged period of time. Men\r\nhave sometimes imagined that they were creating a governmental system\r\n_de novo_, and it occasionally happens, as in France in 1791 and in\r\nPortugal in 1911, that a régime is instituted which has little\r\napparent connection with the past. History demonstrates, however, in\r\nthe first place, that such a régime is apt to perpetuate more of the\r\nold than is at the time supposed and, in the second place, that unless\r\nit is connected vitally with the old, the chances of its achieving\r\nstability or permanence are inconsiderable. In Germany, for example,\r\nif the institutions of the Empire were essentially new in 1871, the\r\ngovernmental systems of the several federated states, and of the towns\r\nand local districts, exhibited numerous elements which in origin were\r\nmediæval. In France, if central institutions, and even the political\r\narrangements of the department and of the arrondissement, do not\r\nantedate the Revolution, the commune, in which the everyday political\r\nactivity of the average citizen runs its course, stands essentially as\r\nit was in the age of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nIf the element of continuity is thus important in the political system\r\nof Germany, France, or Switzerland, in that of England it is\r\nfundamental. It is not too much to say that the most striking aspect\r\nof English constitutional history is the continual preservation, in\r\nthe teeth of inevitable changes, of a preponderating proportion of\r\ninstitutions that reach far into the past. \"The great difficulty which\r\npresses on the student of the English constitution, regarded as a set\r\nof legal rules,\" observes a learned commentator, \"is that he can never\r\ndissociate himself from history. There is hardly a rule which has not\r\na long past, or which can be understood without some consideration of\r\nthe circumstances under which it first came into being.\"[1] It is the\r\npurpose of the present volume to describe European governments as they\r\nto-day exist and operate. It will be necessary in all cases, however,\r\nto accord some consideration to the origins and growth of the\r\npolitical organs and practices which may be described. In respect to\r\nGreat Britain this can mean nothing less than a survey, brief as may\r\nbe, of a thousand years of history.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1: W. R. Anson, The Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution (3d ed., Oxford, 1897), I., 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ANGLO-SAXON BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of the English constitution was that which existed\r\nduring the centuries prior to the Norman Conquest. Political\r\norganization among the Germanic invaders of Britain was of the     (p. 003)\r\nmost rudimentary sort, but the circumstances of the conquest and\r\nsettlement of the island were such as to stimulate a considerable\r\nelaboration of governmental machinery and powers. From the point of\r\nview of subsequent institutional history the most important features\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon governmental system were kingship, the witenagemot,\r\nand the units of local administration--shire, hundred, borough, and\r\ntownship.[2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2: See G. B. Adams, The Origin of the\r\n                   English Constitution (New Haven, 1912), Chap. 1.\r\n                   That the essentials of the English constitution of\r\n                   modern times, in respect to forms and machinery,\r\n                   are products of the feudalization of England which\r\n                   resulted from the Norman Conquest, and not\r\n                   survivals of Anglo-Saxon governmental arrangements,\r\n                   is the well-sustained thesis of this able study.\r\n                   That many important elements, however, were\r\n                   contributed by Anglo-Saxon statecraft is beyond\r\n                   dispute.]\r\n\r\n*3. Kingship.*--The origins of Anglo-Saxon kingship are shrouded in\r\nobscurity, but it is certain that the king of later days was\r\noriginally nothing more than the chieftain of a victorious war-band.\r\nDuring the course of the occupation of the conquered island many\r\nchieftains attained the dignity of kingship, but with the progress of\r\npolitical consolidation one after another of the royal lines was\r\nblotted out, old tribal kingdoms became mere administrative districts\r\nof larger kingdoms, and, eventually, in the ninth century, the whole\r\nof the occupied portions of the country were brought under the control\r\nof a single sovereign. Saxon kingship was elective, patriarchal, and,\r\nin respect to power, limited. Kings were elected by the important men\r\nsitting in council, and while the dignity was hereditary in a family\r\nsupposedly descended from the gods, an immediate heir was not unlikely\r\nto be passed over in favor of a relative who was remoter but abler.[3]\r\nIn both pagan and Christian times the royal office was invested with a\r\npronouncedly sacred character. As early as 690 Ine was king \"by God's\r\ngrace.\" But the actual authority of the king was such as arose\r\nprincipally from the dignity of his office and from the personal\r\ninfluence of the individual monarch.[4] The king was primarily a\r\nwar-leader. He was a law-giver, but his \"dooms\" were likely to be\r\nframed only in consultation with the wise men, and they pertained to\r\nlittle else than the preservation of the peace. He was supreme     (p. 004)\r\njudge, and all crimes and breaches of the peace came to be looked upon\r\nas offenses against him; but he held no court and he had in practice\r\nlittle to do with the administration of justice. Over local affairs he\r\nhad no direct control whatever.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3: Thus, in 871, the minor children of\r\n                   Ethelred I. were passed over in favor of Alfred,\r\n                   younger brother of the late king.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4: The Anglo-Saxon king was \"not the\r\n                   supreme law-giver of Roman ideas, nor the fountain\r\n                   of justice, nor the irresponsible leader, nor the\r\n                   sole and supreme politician, nor the one primary\r\n                   landowner; but the head of the race, the chosen\r\n                   representative of its identity, the successful\r\n                   leader of its enterprises, the guardian of its\r\n                   peace, the president of its assemblies; created by\r\n                   it, and, although empowered with a higher sanction\r\n                   in crowning and anointing, answerable to his\r\n                   people.\" W. Stubbs, Select Charters Illustrative of\r\n                   English Constitutional History (8th ed., Oxford,\r\n                   1895), 12.]\r\n\r\n*4. The Witenagemot.*--Associated with the king in the conduct of\r\npublic business was the council of wise men, or witenagemot. The\r\ncomposition of this body, being determined in the main by the will of\r\nthe individual monarch, varied widely from time to time. The persons\r\nmost likely to be summoned were the members of the royal family, the\r\ngreater ecclesiastics, the king's gesiths or thegns, the ealdormen who\r\nadministered the shires, other leading officers of state and of the\r\nhousehold, and the principal men who held land directly of the king.\r\nThere were included no popularly elected representatives. As a rule,\r\nthe witan was called together three or four times a year. Acting with\r\nthe king, it made laws, imposed taxes, concluded treaties, appointed\r\nealdormen and bishops, and occasionally heard cases not disposed of in\r\nthe courts of the shire and hundred. It was the witan, furthermore,\r\nthat elected the king; and since it could depose him, he was obliged\r\nto recognize a certain responsibility to it. \"It has been a marked and\r\nimportant feature in our constitutional history,\" it is pointed out by\r\nAnson, \"that the king has never, in theory, acted in matters of state\r\nwithout the counsel and consent of a body of advisers.\"[5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5: Law and Custom of the Constitution,\r\n                   II., Pt. 1., 7. Cf. W. Stubbs, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, I., 127.]\r\n\r\n*5. Township, Borough, and Hundred.*--By reason of their persistence,\r\nand their comparative changelessness from earliest times to the later\r\nnineteenth century, the utmost importance attaches to Anglo-Saxon\r\narrangements respecting local government and administration. The\r\nsmallest governmental unit was the township, comprising normally a\r\nvillage surrounded by arable lands, meadows, and woodland. The\r\ntown-moot was a primary assembly of the freemen of the village, by\r\nwhich, under the presidency of a reeve, the affairs of the township\r\nwere administered. A variation of the township was the burgh, or\r\nborough, whose population was apt to be larger and whose political\r\nindependence was greater; but its arrangements for government\r\napproximated closely those of the ordinary township. A group of\r\ntownships comprised a hundred. At the head of the hundred was a\r\nhundred-man, ordinarily elected, but not infrequently appointed by a\r\ngreat landowner or prelate to whom the lands of the hundred belonged.\r\nAssisting him was a council of twelve or more freemen. In the      (p. 005)\r\nhundred-moot was introduced the principle of representation, for to\r\nthe meetings of that body came regularly the reeve, the parish priest,\r\nand four \"best men\" from each of the townships and boroughs comprised\r\nwithin the hundred. The hundred-moot met as often as once a month, and\r\nit had as its principal function the adjudication of disputes and the\r\ndecision of cases, civil, criminal, and ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n*6. The Shire.*--Above the hundred was the shire. Originally, as a\r\nrule, the shires were regions occupied by small but independent\r\ntribes; eventually they became administrative districts of the united\r\nkingdom. At the head of the shire was an ealdorman, appointed by the\r\nking and witan, generally from the prominent men of the shire.\r\nSubordinate to him at first, but in time overshadowing him, was the\r\nshire-reeve, or sheriff, who was essentially a representative of the\r\ncrown, sent to assume charge of the royal lands in the shire, to\r\ncollect the king's revenue, and to receive the king's share of the\r\nfines imposed in the courts. Each shire had its moot, and by reason of\r\nthe fact that the shires and bishoprics were usually coterminous, the\r\nbishop sat with the ealdorman as joint president of this assemblage.\r\nIn theory, at least, the shire-moot was a gathering of the freemen of\r\nthe shire. It met, as a rule, twice a year, and to it were entitled to\r\ncome all freemen, in person or by representation. It was within the\r\ncompetence of those who did not desire to attend to send as spokesmen\r\ntheir reeves or stewards; so that the body was likely to assume the\r\ncharacter of a mixed primary and representative assembly. The\r\nshire-moot decided disputes pertaining to the ownership of land, tried\r\nsuits for which a hearing could not be obtained in the court of the\r\nhundred, and exercised an incidental ecclesiastical jurisdiction.[6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6: The classic description of Anglo-Saxon\r\n                   political institutions is W.

THE NORMAN-PLANTAGENET PERIOD                                 (p. 006)\r\n\r\nAt the coming of William the Conqueror, in 1066, two fundamental\r\nprinciples may be said to have been firmly fixed in the English\r\npolitical system. The first was that of thoroughgoing local\r\nself-government. The second was that of the obligation of the king, in\r\nall matters of first-rate importance, such as the laying of taxes and\r\nthe making of laws, to seek the counsel and consent of some portion of\r\nhis subjects. In the period which was inaugurated by the Conquest\r\nneither of these principles was entirely subverted, yet the Norman era\r\nstands out distinctly as one in which the powers of government were\r\ngathered in the hands of the king and of his immediate agents in a\r\nmeasure unknown at any earlier time. Building in so far as was\r\npossible upon foundations already laid, William was able so to\r\nmanoeuver the consequences of the Conquest as to throw the advantages\r\nall but wholly upon the side of the crown. Feudalism, land-tenure,\r\nmilitary service, taxation, the church--to all was imparted, by force\r\nor by craft, such a bent that the will of the sovereign acquired the\r\npractical effect of law, and monarchy in England, traditionally weak,\r\nwas brought to the verge of sheer absolutism.\r\n\r\n*7. Extension of Centralized Control.*--In respect to the actual\r\nmechanism of government the principal achievement of the\r\nNorman-Plantagenet period was the overhauling and consolidation of the\r\nagencies of administration. Despite the fact that local institutions\r\nof Saxon origin were largely respected, so that they have continued to\r\nthis day the most substantial Anglo-Saxon contribution to English\r\npolity, there was a notable linking-up of these hitherto largely\r\ndisassociated institutions with the institutions of the central\r\ngovernment. This was accomplished in part by the dissolution of the\r\nearldoms by which the monarchy had been menaced in later Saxon days,\r\nand in part by a tremendous increase of the power and importance of\r\nthe sheriffs. It was accomplished still more largely, however, by the\r\norganization of two great departments of government--those of justice\r\nand finance--presided over by dignitaries of the royal household and\r\nmanned by permanent staffs of expert officials. The department of\r\njustice comprised the Curia; that of finance, the Exchequer. At the\r\nhead of the one was the Chancellor; at the head of the other, the\r\nTreasurer. The principal officials within the two comprised a single\r\nbody of men, sitting now as _justitiarii_, or justices, and now as\r\n_barones_ of the Exchequer. The profits and costs of asserting and\r\nadministering justice and the incomings and outgoings of the Exchequer\r\nwere but different aspects of the same fundamental concerns of     (p. 007)\r\nstate.[7] The justices of the Curia who held court on circuit\r\nthroughout the realm and the sheriffs who came up twice a year to\r\nrender to the barons of the Exchequer an account of the sums due from\r\nthe shires served as the real and tangible agencies through which the\r\ncentral and local governments were knit together. As will appear, it\r\nwas from the Norman Curia that, in the course of time, there sprang\r\nimmediately those diversified departments of administration whose\r\nheads comprise the actual executive of the British nation to-day.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7: Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, II., Pt. I., II.]\r\n\r\n*8. King and Great Council.*--Untrammelled by constitutional\r\nrestrictions, the Conqueror and his earlier successors recognized such\r\nlimitations only upon the royal authority as were imposed by powerful\r\nand turbulent subjects. Associated with the king, however, was from\r\nthe first a body known as the _Commune Concilium_, the Common, or\r\nGreat, Council. \"Thrice a year,\" the Saxon Chronicle tells us, \"King\r\nWilliam wore his crown every year he was in England; at Easter he wore\r\nit at Winchester; at Pentecost, at Westminster; and at Christmas, at\r\nGloucester; and at these times all the men of England were with\r\nhim--archbishops, bishops and abbots, earls, thegns and knights.\" By\r\nthe phrase \"all the men of England\" is to be understood only the great\r\necclesiastics, the principal officers of state, and the king's\r\ntenants-in-chief--in truth, only such of the more important of these\r\nas were summoned individually to the sovereign's presence. At least in\r\ntheory, however, the Norman kings were accustomed to consult this\r\ngathering of magnates, very much as their predecessors had been\r\naccustomed to consult the witenagemot, upon all important questions of\r\nlegislation, finance, and public policy. It may, indeed, be said that\r\nit is the development of this Council that comprises the central\r\nsubject of English constitutional history; for, \"out of it, directly\r\nor indirectly, by one process or another, have been evolved\r\nParliament, the Cabinet, and the courts of law.\"[8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8: W. Wilson, The State (rev. ed.,\r\n                   Boston, 1903), 369.]\r\n\r\n*9. The Plantagenet Monarchy.*--During the century and a half following\r\nthe death of the Conqueror the vigor of the monarchy varied\r\nenormously, but not until the days of King John can there be said to\r\nhave been any loss of power or independence which amounted to more\r\nthan a passing circumstance. In a charter granted at the beginning of\r\nhis reign, in 1100, Henry I. confirmed the liberties of his subjects\r\nand promised to respect the laws of Edward the Confessor; but the new\r\nsovereign did not propose, and no one imagined that he intended to\r\npropose, to relax any of the essential and legitimate power which had\r\nbeen transmitted to him by his father and brother. The reign of    (p. 008)\r\nStephen (1135-1154) was an epoch of anarchy happily unparalleled in\r\nthe history of the nation. During the course of it the royal authority\r\nsank to its lowest ebb since the days of the Danish incursions. But\r\nthe able and wonderfully energetic Henry II. (1154-1189) recovered all\r\nthat had been lost and added not a little of his own account. \"Henry\r\nII.,\" it has been said, \"found a nation wearied out with the miseries\r\nof anarchy, and the nation found in Henry II. a king with a passion\r\nfor administration.\"[9] With the fundamental purpose of reducing all\r\nof his subjects to equality before an identical system of law, the\r\ngreat Plantagenet sovereign waged determined warfare upon both the\r\nrebellious nobility and the independent clergy. He was not entirely\r\nsuccessful, especially in his conflict with the clergy; but he\r\neffectually prevented a reversion of the nation to feudal chaos, and\r\nhe invested the king's law with a sanction which it had known hardly\r\neven in the days of the Conqueror. The reign of Henry II. has been\r\ndeclared, indeed, to \"initiate the rule of law.\"[10] By reviving and\r\nplacing upon a permanent basis the provincial visitations of the royal\r\njustices, for both judicial and fiscal purposes, and by extending in\r\nthe local administration of justice and finance the principle of the\r\njury, Henry contributed fundamentally to the development of the\r\nEnglish Common Law, the jury, and the modern hierarchy of courts. By\r\nappointing as sheriffs lawyers or soldiers, rather than great barons,\r\nhe fostered the influence of the central government in local affairs.\r\nBy commuting military service for a money payment (_scutage_), and by\r\na revival of the ancient militia system (the _fyrd_), he brought the\r\ncontrol of the armed forces of the nation effectually under royal\r\ncontrol. By the frequent summons of the Great Council and the\r\nsystematic reference to it of business of moment he contributed to the\r\nimportance of an institution through whose amplification a century\r\nlater Parliament was destined to be brought into existence.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9: Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, II., Pt. I., 13.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10: Stubbs, Select Charters, 21.]\r\n\r\n*10. The Great Charter, 1215.*--The period of Richard I. (1189-1199)\r\nwas, in constitutional matters, a continuation of that of Henry II.\r\nRichard was absent from the kingdom throughout almost the whole of the\r\nreign, but under the guidance of officials trained by Henry the\r\nmachinery of government operated substantially as before. Under John\r\n(1199-1216) came a breakdown, occasioned principally by the sovereign's\r\npersistence in evading certain limitations upon the royal authority\r\nwhich already had assumed the character of established rules of the\r\nconstitution. One of these forbade that the king should impose fresh\r\ntaxation except with the advice and consent of the Great Council.  (p. 009)\r\nAnother enjoined that a man should not be fined or otherwise despoiled\r\nof his property except in virtue of judicial sentence. These and other\r\nprinciples John habitually disregarded, with the consequence that in\r\ntime he found himself without a party and driven to the alternative of\r\ndeposition or acceptance of the guarantee of liberties which the\r\nbarons, the Church, and the people were united in demanding of him.\r\nThe upshot was the promulgation, June 15, 1215, of Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nNo instrument in the annals of any nation exceeds in importance the\r\nGreat Charter. The whole of English constitutional history, once\r\nremarked Bishop Stubbs, is but one long commentary upon it. The\r\nsignificance of the Charter arises not simply from the fact that it\r\nwas wrested from an unwilling sovereign by concerted action of the\r\nvarious orders of society (action such as in France and other\r\ncontinental countries never, in mediæval times, became possible), but\r\nprincipally from the remarkable summary which it embodies of the\r\nfundamental principles of English government in so far as those\r\nprinciples had ripened by the thirteenth century. The Charter\r\ncontained little or nothing that was new. Its authors, the barons,\r\nsought merely to gather up within a reasonably brief document those\r\nprinciples and customs which the better kings of England had been wont\r\nto observe, but which in the evil days of Richard and John had been\r\npersistently evaded. There was no thought of a new form of government,\r\nor of a new code of laws, but rather of the redress of present and\r\npractical grievances. Not a new constitution, but good government in\r\nconformity with the old one, was the essential object. Naturally\r\nenough, therefore, the instrument was based, in most of its important\r\nprovisions, upon the charter granted by Henry I. in 1100, even as that\r\ninstrument was based, in the main, upon the righteous laws of Edward\r\nthe Confessor. After like manner, the Charter of 1215 became, in its\r\nturn, the foundation to which reassertions of constitutional liberty\r\nin subsequent times were apt to return; and, under greater or lesser\r\npressure, the Charter itself was \"confirmed\" by numerous sovereigns\r\nwho proved themselves none too much disposed to observe its\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIn effect the Charter was a treaty between the king and his dissatisfied\r\nsubjects. It was essentially a feudal document, and the majority of\r\nits provisions relate primarily to the privileges and rights of the\r\nbarons. None the less, it contains clauses that affected all classes\r\nof society, and it is especially noteworthy that the barons and clergy\r\npledged themselves in it to extend to their dependents the same\r\ncustoms and liberties which they were themselves demanding of the\r\ncrown. Taking the Charter as a whole, it guaranteed the freedom of\r\nthe Church, defined afresh and in precise terms surviving feudal   (p. 010)\r\nincidents and customs, placed safeguards about the liberties of the\r\nboroughs, pledged security of property and of trade, and stipulated\r\nimportant regulations respecting government and law, notably that\r\nwhenever the king should propose the assessment of scutages or of\r\nunusual aids he should take the advice of the General Council,\r\ncomposed of the tenants-in-chief summoned individually in the case of\r\nthe greater ones and through the sheriffs in the case of those of\r\nlesser importance. Certain general clauses, e.g., that pledging that\r\njustice should neither be bought nor sold, and that prescribing that a\r\nfreeman might not be imprisoned, outlawed, or dispossessed of his\r\nproperty save by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land,\r\nmeant in effect considerably less than they sometimes have been\r\ninterpreted to mean.[11] Yet even they served to emphasize the\r\nfundamental principle upon which the political and legal structure was\r\nintended to be grounded, that, namely, of impartial and unvarying\r\njustice.[12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11: The term \"peers,\" as here employed,\r\n                   means only equals in rank. The clause cited does\r\n                   not imply trial by jury. It comprises a guarantee\r\n                   simply that the barons should not be judged by\r\n                   persons whose feudal rank was inferior to their\r\n                   own. Jury trial was increasingly common in the\r\n                   thirteenth century, but it was not guaranteed in\r\n                   the Great Charter.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12: Good accounts of the institutional\r\n                   aspects of the Norman-Angevin period are Stubbs,\r\n                   Constitutional History, I., 315-682, II., 1-164;\r\n                   Taylor, Origin and Growth of the English\r\n                   Constitution, I., Bk. 2, Chaps. 2-3; Adams, The\r\n                   Origin of the English Constitution, Chaps. 1-4; and\r\n                   White, Making of the English Constitution, 73-119.\r\n                   Two excellent little books are Stubbs, Early\r\n                   Plantagenets (London, 1876) and Mrs. J.

THE RISE OF PARLIAMENT                                         (p. 011)\r\n\r\n*11. Beginnings of the Representative Principle.*--The thirteenth\r\ncentury was clearly one of the most important periods in the growth of\r\nthe English constitution. It was marked not merely by the contest\r\nwhich culminated in the grant of the Great Charter but also by the\r\nbeginnings, in its essentials, of Parliament. The formative epoch in\r\nthe history of Parliament may be said to have been, more precisely,\r\nthe second half of the reign of Henry III. (1216-1272), together with\r\nthe reign of the legislator-king Edward I. (1272-1307). The creation\r\nof Parliament as we know it came about through the signal enlargement\r\nof the Norman-Plantagenet Great Council by the introduction of\r\nrepresentative elements, followed by the splitting of the\r\nheterogeneous mass of members definitely into two co-ordinate\r\nchambers. The representative principle was in England no new thing in\r\nthe thirteenth century. As has appeared, there were important\r\nmanifestations of it in the local governmental system of Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes. As brought to bear in the development of Parliament, however,\r\nthe principle is generally understood to have sprung from the\r\ntwelfth-century practice of electing assessors to fix the value of\r\nreal and personal property for purposes of taxation, and of jurors to\r\npresent criminal matters before the king's justices. Thus, Henry II.'s\r\nSaladin Tithe of 1188--the first national imposition upon incomes and\r\nmovable property--was assessed, at least in part, by juries of\r\nneighbors elected by, and in a sense representative of, the taxpayers\r\nof the various parishes. By the opening of the thirteenth century the\r\nidea was fast taking hold upon the minds of Englishmen, not only that\r\nthe taxpayer ought to have a voice in the levying of taxes, but that\r\nbetween representation and taxation there was a certain natural and\r\ninevitable connection. In the Great Charter, as has been stated, it\r\nwas stipulated that in the assessment of scutages and of all save the\r\nthree commonly recognized feudal aids the king should seek the advice\r\nof the General Council. The General Council of the earlier thirteenth\r\ncentury was not regularly a representative body, but it was not beyond\r\nthe range of possibility to impart to it a representative character,\r\nand in point of fact that is precisely what was done. To facilitate\r\nthe process of taxation it was found expedient by the central\r\nauthorities to carry over into the domain of national affairs that\r\nprinciple of popular representation which already was doing approved\r\nservice within the sphere of local justice and finance, and from this\r\nadaptation arose, step by step, the conversion of the old gathering of\r\nfeudal magnates into a national parliamentary assembly.\r\n\r\n*12. Early Parliaments.*--The means by which the transformation    (p. 012)\r\nwas accomplished consisted in the first instance, as has been said, in\r\nthe introduction into the Council of new and representative elements.\r\nThe earliest step in this direction was taken in 1213, when King John,\r\nharassed by fiscal and political difficulties, addressed to the\r\nsheriffs a series of writs commanding that four discreet knights from\r\nevery county be sent to participate in a deliberative council to be\r\nheld at Oxford. The practice took root slowly. In 1254 Henry III., in\r\nsore need of money for the prosecution of his wars in Gascony,\r\nrequired of the sheriffs that two knights be sent from each county to\r\nconfer with the barons and clergy relative to the subsidies which\r\nshould be accorded the crown. The desired vote of supplies was refused\r\nand the long-brewing contest between the king and the barons broke in\r\ncivil war. But during the struggle that ensued the foundations of\r\nParliament were still more securely laid. Following the king's defeat\r\nat Lewes, in 1264, Simon de Montfort, leader of the barons, convened a\r\nparliament composed of not only barons and clergy but also four\r\nknights from each shire, and at London during the following year, he\r\ncaused again to be assembled, in addition to five earls, eighteen\r\nbarons, and a large body of clergy, two knights from each of the\r\nseveral shires and two burgesses from each of twenty-one towns known\r\nto be friendly to the barons' cause. These proceedings were\r\nessentially revolutionary and unauthorized. Even the gathering of\r\n1265, as Stubbs remarks, presented the appearance largely of a party\r\nconvention, and there is no evidence that its author intended such a\r\nbody to be regularly or frequently summoned, or even summoned a second\r\ntime at all. None the less, now for the first time representatives of\r\nthe towns were brought into political co-operation with the barons,\r\nclergy, and knights; and the circumstance was filled with promise.\r\nDuring the ensuing thirty years there were several \"parliaments,\"\r\nalthough the extent to which knights and burgesses participated in\r\nthem is uncertain. The period was one of experimentation. In 1273 four\r\nknights from each shire and four citizens from each town joined the\r\nmagnates in taking the oath of fealty to the new and absent sovereign,\r\nEdward I. The First Statute of Westminster, in 1275, declares itself\r\nto have been adopted with the assent of the \"commonalty of the realm.\"\r\nIn 1283 a parliament was held which almost precisely duplicated that\r\nof 1265. In 1290, and again in 1294, there was one, in which, however,\r\nrepresentation of the towns was omitted.\r\n\r\nThe gathering which served to fix the type for all time to come was\r\nEdward I.'s so-called Model Parliament of 1295. To this parliament the\r\nking summoned severally the two archbishops, all of the bishops, the\r\ngreater abbots, and the more important earls and barons; while     (p. 013)\r\nevery sheriff was enjoined to see that two knights were chosen from\r\neach shire, two citizens from each city, and two burgesses from each\r\nborough. Each bishop was authorized, furthermore, to bring with him\r\nhis prior or the dean of the cathedral chapter, the archdeacons of his\r\ndiocese, one proctor or agent for his cathedral chapter, and two of\r\nhis diocesan clergy. In the parliament as actually convened there were\r\n2 archbishops, 18 bishops with their lesser clergy, 66 abbots, 3 heads\r\nof religious orders, 9 earls, 41 barons, 63 knights of the shire, and\r\n172 representatives of the cities and boroughs--an aggregate of\r\napproximately 400 persons. There were thus present in the assemblage,\r\nin person or by deputy, all of the constituent orders of English\r\nsociety, and the irregular device of Simon de Montfort was vested at\r\nlast with the character of legality. After Edward I. Parliament may be\r\nsaid to have been an established institution of the realm. Its\r\nmeetings long continued intermittent and infrequent, and its powers\r\nfrom time to time varied enormously, but the place which it filled in\r\nthe economy of the nation grew ever more important.\r\n\r\n*13. Establishment of the Bicameral System.*--Like its counterpart in\r\nFrance, the Estates-General, the English Parliament comprised the\r\nthree great estates or orders--nobility, clergy, and commons--of\r\nwhich, aside from the peasantry, mediæval society in all western\r\nEuropean countries was composed. In the working out of its internal\r\nstructure, however, two chambers resulted, rather than, as in France,\r\nthree. Originally the three estates sat separately. Their primary\r\nbusiness was the voting of supplies and, the principle being that a\r\ntax ought to be conceded by those who would be called upon to pay it,\r\nthe natural course was for the lords to grant their scutages and aids,\r\nthe commoners their tenths and fifteenths, and the clergy their\r\nsubsidies, apart. Indeed there is reason to believe that at times even\r\nthe knights and the burgesses deliberated separately. Gradually,\r\nhowever, there appeared certain affiliations of interest which\r\noperated to modify the original practice. In the first place, the\r\nlesser clergy, inconvenienced by attendance and preferring to vote\r\ntheir contributions in the special ecclesiastical assemblages known as\r\nthe convocations of Canterbury and York, contrived to throw off\r\nentirely their obligation of membership. The greater clergy and the\r\ngreater barons, in the next place, developed sufficiently large\r\ninterests in common to be amalgamated with ease in one body.\r\nSimilarly, the lesser barons found their interests essentially\r\nidentical with those of the country freeholders, represented by the\r\nknights of the shire, and with those of the burgesses. The upshot was a\r\ngradual alignment of the aggregate membership in two great groups, (p. 014)\r\nthe one of which became historically the House of Lords, the other the\r\nHouse of Commons. At the beginning of the reign of Edward III.\r\n(1327-1377) the three estates still sat separately, but before the\r\nclose of this period the bicameral arrangement seems definitely to\r\nhave been established. There is no evidence that at any stage of their\r\nhistory the three groups ever sat as a single body. It need hardly be\r\nemphasized that the entire course of English history since the\r\nfourteenth century has been affected profoundly by the fact that the\r\nnational assembly took the form of two houses rather than of one, as\r\ndid the Scotch, of three as did the French, or of four as did the\r\nSwedish. But for the withdrawal of the lesser clergy, the number might\r\nvery possibly have been three.\r\n\r\n*14. Powers of Finance and Legislation.*--Structurally, the English\r\nParliament is a creation of the Middle Ages; politically, it is a\r\nproduct of modern times, and, in no small measure, of the past hundred\r\nyears. Before the close of the Middle Ages, however, it had acquired a\r\nsum total of authority which at least gave promise of its development\r\ninto a great co-ordinate, if not a preponderating, power in the state.\r\nIn the first place, it had forced the establishment of the twin\r\nprinciples of public finance (1) that the right to levy taxes of every\r\nsort lay within its hands and (2) that the crown might impose no\r\ndirect tax without its assent, nor any indirect tax save such as might\r\nbe justified under the customs recognized in Magna Carta. When Edward\r\nI. confirmed the Charter, in 1297, he agreed that no tallages or aids\r\nshould thereafter be taken without the assent of the archbishops,\r\nbishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and other freemen of the\r\nland. A statute of 1340 reiterated the principle still more\r\nspecifically. In 1395 appeared the formula employed to this day in the\r\nmaking of parliamentary grants, \"by the Commons with the advice and\r\nassent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal.\" And in 1407 Henry IV.\r\nextended the royal approval to the principle that money grants should\r\nbe initiated in the Commons, assented to by the Lords, and only\r\nthereafter reported to the king. For the ancient theory of taxation by\r\nestates was substituted, slowly but inevitably, the modern doctrine of\r\nthe fiscal pre-eminence of the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe second point at which Parliament made decisive advance before the\r\nclose of the mediæval period was in respect to powers of ordinary\r\nlegislation. Originally, Parliament was not conceived of as, in the\r\nstrict sense, a law-making body at all. The magnates who composed the\r\nGeneral Council had exercised the right to advise the crown in\r\nlegislative matters, and their successors in Parliament continued to\r\ndo the same, but the commoners who in the thirteenth century were  (p. 015)\r\nbrought in were present, in theory, for fiscal rather than legislative\r\npurposes. The distinction, however, was difficult to maintain, and\r\nwith the continued growth of the parliamentary body the legislative\r\ncharacter was recognized eventually to be inherent in the whole of it.\r\nAt the opening of the fourteenth century laws were made, technically,\r\n_by_ the king with the _assent_ of the magnates at the _request_ of\r\nthe commoners. The knights and burgesses were recognized as\r\npetitioners for laws, rather than as legislators. They could ask for\r\nthe enactment of a statute, or for a clearer definition of law, but it\r\nwas for the king and his councillors to determine finally whether\r\nlegislation was required and what form it should assume. Even when a\r\nlaw which was requested was promised it not infrequently happened that\r\nthe intent of the Commons was thwarted, for the text of the measure\r\nwas not drawn up, normally, until after the parliament was dissolved,\r\nboth form and content were determined arbitrarily by the crown and\r\ncouncil, and between petition and statute there might be, and often\r\nwas, gross discrepancy.\r\n\r\n*15. Development of the Legislative Process.*--By a memorable statute of\r\n1322, in the reign of Edward II., it was stipulated that \"the matters\r\nwhich are to be established for the estate of our lord the king and of\r\nhis heirs, and for the estate of the realm and of the people, shall be\r\ntreated, accorded, and established in parliaments, by our lord the king,\r\nand by the assent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and the\r\ncommonalty of the realm; according as it hath been before accustomed.\"[13]\r\nThis declaration is understood to have established, not only the\r\nessentially legislative character of Parliament, but the legislative\r\nparity of the commoners with the magnates. It remained, however, to\r\nsubstitute for the right of petition the right of legislating by bill.\r\nThroughout the fourteenth century Parliament, and especially the\r\nCommons, pressed for an explicit recognition of the principle that the\r\nstatute in its final form should be identical with the petition upon\r\nwhich it was based. In 1414 Henry V. granted that \"from henceforth\r\nnothing be enacted to the petitions of his commons that be contrary to\r\ntheir asking, whereby they should be bound without their assent.\"[14]\r\nThe promise tended in practice to be evaded, and late in the reign of\r\nHenry VI. there was brought about an alteration of procedure in\r\naccordance with which measures were henceforth to be introduced in\r\neither house, in the form of drafted bills. The legislative process\r\nwas now essentially reversed. The right of initiative was secured to\r\nthe Commons, concurrently with the Lords; the crown was restricted to\r\na right of veto or assent. The change in procedure was reflected   (p. 016)\r\nin a change of formula. Statutes began to be made \"by the King's most\r\nexcellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords\r\nspiritual and temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled,\r\nand by the authority of the same.\" And these words comprise the\r\nformula with which every act of Parliament to-day begins. Technically,\r\nthe laws were, and are still, made by the crown; practically\r\nParliament, once merely a petitioning and advising body, had become a\r\nfull-fledged legislative assemblage.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13: Adams and Stephens, Select Documents,\r\n                   97.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14: Ibid., 182.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the later fourteenth and earlier fifteenth centuries the\r\ngrowth of Parliament in self-assertiveness was remarkable. Twice\r\nduring the fourteenth century, in 1327 and in 1399, it exercised the\r\nfundamental prerogative of deposing the sovereign and of bestowing the\r\ncrown upon a successor.[15] And before the close of the Lancastrian\r\nera it had assumed advanced ground in demanding the right of\r\nappropriating (as well as of voting) subsidies, the accounting by the\r\npublic authorities for moneys expended, the removal of objectionable\r\nministers, and the annual assembling of the two houses. During the\r\ncivil wars of the second half of the fifteenth century parliamentary\r\naggressiveness and influence materially declined, and at the opening\r\nof the Tudor period, in 1485, the body was in by no means the\r\nfavorable position it had occupied fifty years earlier. As will\r\nappear, its eclipse continued largely through the epoch of the Tudors.\r\nYet its broader aspects had been permanently fixed and its\r\nperpetuation in the constitutional system positively assured.[16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15: Strictly, upon the first of these\r\n                   occasions the sovereign, Edward II., was driven by\r\n                   threat of deposition to abdicate.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16: On the rise of Parliament see Stubbs,\r\n                   Constitutional History of England, II., Chaps. 15,\r\n                   17; Taylor, Origins and Growth of the English\r\n                   Constitution, I., 428-616; G.

The Permanent Council.*--One line, thus, along which were laid the\r\nfoundations of the English governmental system of to-day comprised the\r\ntransformation of the Norman Great Council into the semi-aristocratic,\r\nsemi-democratic assemblage known as Parliament. A parallel line    (p. 017)\r\nwas the development from the Great Council of a body designated after\r\nthe thirteenth century as the Permanent, after the fifteenth as the\r\nPrivy, Council, and likewise of the four principal courts of law. By a\r\nvery gradual process those members of the original Council who were\r\nattached in some immediate manner to the court or to the administrative\r\nsystem acquired a status which was different from that of their\r\ncolleagues. The Great Council met irregularly and infrequently. So\r\nlikewise did Parliament. But the services of the court and the\r\nbusiness of government must go on continuously, and for the care of\r\nthese things there grew up a body which at first comprised essentially\r\na standing commission, an inner circle, of the Council, but which in\r\ntime acquired a virtually independent position and was designated, for\r\npurposes of distinction, as the Permanent Council. The composition of\r\nthis body varied from time to time. Certain functionaries were\r\nincluded regularly, while the remaining members owed their places to\r\nspecial summons of the crown. Its powers were enormous, being at the\r\nsame time administrative, judicial, and financial, and the mass of\r\nbusiness to which it was required to give attention was increasingly\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n*17. The Courts of Law.*--Three things resulted. In the first place, the\r\nPermanent Council acquired, in practice, complete detachment from the\r\nolder and larger body. In the second place, to facilitate the\r\naccomplishment of its work there were introduced into it trained\r\nlawyers, expert financiers, and men of other sorts of special\r\naptitudes--men, often, who in rank were but commoners. Finally, there\r\nsplit off from the body a succession of committees, to each of which\r\nwas assigned a particular branch of administrative or judicial\r\nbusiness. In this manner arose the four great courts of law: (1) the\r\nCourt of Exchequer, to which was consigned jurisdiction over all\r\nfiscal causes in which the crown was directly concerned; (2) the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, with jurisdiction over civil cases between subject\r\nand subject; (3) the Court of King's Bench, presided over nominally by\r\nthe king himself and taking cognizance of a variety of cases for which\r\nother provision was not made; and (4) the Court of Chancery, which,\r\nunder the presidency of the Chancellor, heard and decided cases\r\ninvolving the principles of equity. The differentiation of these\r\ntribunals, beginning in the early twelfth century, was completed by\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth. Technically, all were co-ordinate\r\ncourts, from which appeal lay to the King in Council; and of the\r\njudicial prerogative which the Council as a whole thus retained there\r\nare still, as will be pointed out, certain survivals. By the time\r\nof Henry VI. (1422-1461) the enlargement of membership and the\r\nspecialization of functions of the Permanent Council had           (p. 018)\r\nprogressed so far that the Council had ceased entirely to be a working\r\nunit. In the end what happened was that, precisely as the Permanent\r\nCouncil had been derived by selection from the original Great Council,\r\nso from the overgrown Permanent Council was constituted, in the\r\nfifteenth century, a smaller and more compact administrative body to\r\nwhich was assigned the designation of \"Privy Council.\"[17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17: Stubbs, Constitutional History, II.,\r\n                   Chap. 13; White, Making of the English\r\n                   Constitution, 123-251; Adams, Origin of the English\r\n                   Constitution, 136-143; W.

Popular Absolutism.*--The salient fact of the Tudor period of\r\nEnglish history (1485-1603) is the vigor and dominance of the\r\nmonarchy. From the Wars of the Roses the nation emerged in need, above\r\nall other things, of discipline and repose. It was the part of the\r\nTudors to enforce relentlessly the one and to foster systematically\r\nthe other. The period was one in which aristocratic turbulence was\r\nrepressed, extraordinary tribunals were erected to bring to justice\r\npowerful offenders, vagrancy was punished, labor was found for the\r\nunemployed, trade was stimulated, the navy was organized on a\r\npermanent basis, the diffusion of wealth and of education was\r\nencouraged, the growth of a strong middle class was promoted--in\r\nshort, one in which out of chaos was brought order and out of weakness\r\nstrength. These things were the work of a government which was\r\nstrongly paternal, even sheerly despotic, and, for a time at least,\r\nthe evolution of parliamentary machinery was utterly arrested. But it\r\nshould be observed that the question in sixteenth-century England was\r\nnot between strong monarchy on the one hand and parliamentary\r\ngovernment on the other. The alternatives were, rather, strong\r\nmonarchy and baronial anarchy. This the nation clearly perceived, and,\r\nof the two, it much preferred the former.\r\n\r\n\"The Tudor monarchy,\" says an English scholar, \"unlike most other\r\ndespotisms, did not depend on gold or force, on the possession of vast\r\nestates, unlimited taxation, or a standing army. It rested on the\r\nwilling support of the nation at large, a support due to the\r\ndeeply-rooted conviction that a strong executive was necessary to the\r\nnational unity, and that, in the face of the dangers which threatened\r\nthe country both at home and abroad, the sovereign must be allowed a\r\nfree hand. It was this conviction, instinctively felt rather than\r\ndefinitely realized, which enabled Henry VIII. not only to crush open\r\nrebellion but to punish the slightest signs of opposition to his   (p. 019)\r\nwill, to regulate the consciences of his subjects, and to extend the\r\nlegal conception of treason to limits hitherto unknown. It was this\r\nwhich rendered it possible for the ministers of Edward VI. to impose a\r\nProtestant régime upon a Romanist majority, and allowed Mary to enter\r\nupon a hateful marriage and to drag the country into a disastrous war.\r\nIt was this, finally, which enabled Elizabeth to choose her own line\r\nin domestic and foreign policy, to defer for thirty years the war with\r\nSpain, and to resist, almost single-handed, the pressure for further\r\necclesiastical change. The Tudor monarchy was essentially a national\r\nmonarchy. It was popular with the multitude, and it was actively\r\nsupported by the influential classes, the nobility, the gentry, the\r\nlawyers, the merchants, who sat as members of Parliament at\r\nWestminster, mustered the forces of the shire as Lords-Lieutenant, or\r\nbore the burden of local government as borough magistrates and\r\njustices of the peace.\"[18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18: G. W. Prothero, Select Statutes and\r\n                   other Constitutional Documents Illustrative of the\r\n                   Reigns of Elizabeth and James I, (Oxford, 1898),\r\n                   xvii--xviii.]\r\n\r\n*19. The Privy Council.*--The times of the Tudors and of the early\r\nStuarts have been designated with aptness the period of \"government by\r\ncouncil.\" Parliament continued to exercise a certain control over\r\nlegislation and taxation, but it was in and through the Privy Council,\r\ntogether with certain subordinate councils, that the absolute\r\nmonarchy, in the main, performed its work. The Privy Council--or\r\nsimply \"the Council\"--comprised ordinarily about seventeen or eighteen\r\npersons, although under Henry VIII. its membership at one time\r\napproached forty. The councillors were almost invariably members of\r\none or the other of the two houses of Parliament, an arrangement by\r\nwhich was facilitated the control of the proceedings of that body by\r\nthe Government, but which did not yet involve any recognized\r\nresponsibility of the executive to the legislative branch. After Queen\r\nMary the councillors were, with few exceptions, laymen. Technically,\r\nthe function of the Council was only advisory, but in practice even\r\nthose sovereigns, as Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, who were most vigilant\r\nand industrious, were obliged to allow to the councillors large\r\ndiscretion in the conduct of public business, and under the early\r\nStuarts the Council very nearly ruled the realm. Representing at all\r\ntimes the sovereign, who was supposed invariably to be present at its\r\ndeliberations, the Council supervised the work of administration,\r\nregulated trade, granted licenses, controlled the press, kept an eye\r\non the law courts, ferreted out plots, took measures to suppress\r\nrebellion, controlled the movements of the fleet, assisted in the\r\nmanagement of ecclesiastical affairs, and, in short, considered    (p. 020)\r\nand took action upon substantially all concerns of state. By virtue of\r\nits right to issue orders or ordinances it possessed a power that was\r\nsemi-legislative; through its regulation of trade, its management of\r\nloans and benevolences, and its determination of military obligations,\r\nit participated actively in the control of taxation; and, under the\r\npresidency of the crown, it possessed the functions of a supreme\r\ntribunal, whose jurisdiction, in part original and in part appellate,\r\nwas widespread and peculiarly despotic.[19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19: Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional\r\n                   Documents, cii. See A. V. Dicey, The Privy Council\r\n                   (London, 1887); E. Percy, The Privy Council under\r\n                   the Tudors (Oxford, 1907).]\r\n\r\n*20. Other Councils: The Star Chamber.*--In 1487 there was created a\r\nspecial tribunal, consisting at the outset of seven great officials\r\nand members of the Council, including two judges, to take special\r\ncognizance of cases involving breaches of the law by offenders who\r\nwere too powerful to be reached under the operation of the ordinary\r\ncourts. This was the tribunal subsequently known, from its\r\nmeeting-place, as the Court of Star Chamber. In effect it was from the\r\nbeginning a committee of the Privy Council, empowered to exercise a\r\njurisdiction which in truth had long been exercised extra-legally by\r\nthe Council as a whole. The relation of the two institutions inclined\r\nin practice to become ever closer, and by the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury the Star Chamber had been enlarged to include all of the\r\nmembers of the Council, together with the two chief justices; and\r\nsince the Star Chamber possessed a statutory sanction which the\r\nCouncil lacked, the judicial business of the older body was despatched\r\nregularly by its members sitting under the guise of the newer one. The\r\ntendency of the Tudor régime toward the conciliar type of government\r\nis manifested further by the creation of numerous subsidiary councils\r\nand courts whose history cannot be recounted here. Most of these were\r\nbrought into existence during the reign of Henry VIII. Those of\r\nprincipal importance were (1) the Council of the North, set up in\r\n1539; (2) the Council of Wales, confirmed by statute of 1542; (3) the\r\nCourt of Castle Chamber, reproducing in Ireland the principal features\r\nof the English Star Chamber; (4) the Courts of Augmentation, First\r\nFruits and Annates, and Wards; and (5) the Elizabethan Court of High\r\nCommission.[20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20: A. T. Carter, Outlines of English\r\n                   Legal History (London, 1899), Chap. 12; A.

(London, 1892), I., Chap. 2;\r\n                   Dicey, The Privy Council, 94-115.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. PARLIAMENT UNDER THE TUDORS                                   (p. 021)\r\n\r\n*21. Control by the Crown.*--By the Tudors generally, and especially\r\nHenry VIII. and Elizabeth, Parliament was regarded as a tool to be\r\nused by the crown, rather than as in any sense an independent,\r\nco-ordinate power in the state. When innovations were to be\r\nintroduced, such as those carried through by Henry VIII., it was Tudor\r\npolicy to clothe them with the vestments of parliamentarism, to the\r\nend that they might be given the appearance and the sanction of\r\npopular measures; and when subsidies were to be obtained, it was\r\nrecognized to be expedient to impart to them, in similar manner, the\r\nsemblance of voluntary gifts on the part of the nation. It was no part\r\nof Tudor intent, however, that Parliament should be permitted to\r\ninitiate measures, or even to exercise any actual discretion in the\r\nadoption, amendment, or rejection of proposals submitted by the\r\nGovernment. There were several means by which the crown contrived to\r\nimpede the rise of Parliament above the subordinate position which\r\nthat body occupied at the accession of Henry VII. One was the practice\r\nof convening Parliament irregularly and infrequently and of bringing\r\nits sessions to an early close. Another, employed especially during\r\nThomas Cromwell's ministry under Henry VIII. and during the reign of\r\nElizabeth, was that of tampering with the freedom of borough and\r\ncounty elections. A third was the habit, also notorious under Henry\r\nVIII. and Elizabeth, of dictating and directing in all that was\r\nessential in the proceedings of the chambers. Henry VIII. bullied his\r\nparliaments systematically; Elizabeth, by cajolery, flattery, deceit,\r\nand other arts of which she was mistress, attained through less\r\nboisterous methods the same general end. Measures were thrust upon the\r\nchambers accompanied by peremptory demand for their enactment;\r\nobjectionable projects originated by private members were stifled; and\r\nthe fundamental parliamentary privileges of free speech, freedom from\r\narrest, and access to the sovereign were arbitrarily suspended or\r\notherwise flagrantly violated.\r\n\r\n*22. The Independence of the Crown.*--Finally must be mentioned certain\r\ndevices by which the crown was enabled to evade limitations\r\ntheoretically imposed by Parliament's recognized authority. One of\r\nthese was the issuing of proclamations. In the sixteenth century it\r\nwas generally maintained that the sovereign, acting alone or with the\r\nadvice of the Council, could issue proclamations controlling the\r\nliberty of the subject, so long as such edicts did not violate statute\r\nor common law. As a corollary, it was maintained also that the crown\r\ncould dispense with the action of law in individual cases and at   (p. 022)\r\ntimes of crisis. The range covered by these prerogatives was broad and\r\nundefined, and in the hands of an aggressive monarch they constituted\r\na serious invasion of the powers of legislation nominally vested in\r\nParliament. It is true that the act of 1539 imparting to royal\r\nproclamations the force of law was repealed in 1547; but proclamations\r\ncontinued, especially under Elizabeth and James I., not only to be\r\nnumerous, but to be enforced relentlessly by penalties inflicted\r\nthrough the Star Chamber. The most important power of Parliament in\r\nthe sixteenth century was still that of voting supplies. But in\r\nrespect to finance, as in respect to legislation, the crown possessed\r\neffective means of evading parliamentary control. In the first place,\r\nthe sovereign possessed large revenues, arising from crown lands,\r\nfeudal rights, profits of jurisdiction, and ecclesiastical payments,\r\nwith which Parliament had nothing whatever to do. In the second place,\r\nthe great indirect taxes--customs duties and tonnage and\r\npoundage--were, in the sixteenth century, voted at the accession of a\r\nsovereign for the whole of the reign. It was only in respect to\r\nextraordinary taxes--\"subsidies\" and \"tenths and fifteenths\"--that\r\nParliament was in a position effectually to make or mar the fiscal\r\nfortunes of the Government; except that, of course, it was always open\r\nto Parliament to criticise the financial expedients of the crown, such\r\nas the sale of monopolies, the levy of \"impositions,\" and the\r\ncollection of benevolences, and to influence, if it could, the policy\r\npursued in relation to these matters.\r\n\r\n*23. The House of Lords in 1485.*--Despite the numerous strictures that\r\nhave been mentioned, Parliament in the Tudor period by no means stood\r\nstill. The enormous power and independence exhibited by the chambers,\r\nespecially the Commons, in the seventeenth century was the product of\r\nsubstantial, if more or less hidden, growth during the previous one\r\nhundred and fifty years. The composition of the two houses at the\r\naccession of Henry VII. was not clearly defined. The House of Lords\r\nwas but a small body. It comprised simply those lords, temporal and\r\nspiritual, who were entitled to receive from the king, when a\r\nparliament was to be held, a special writ, i.e., an individual\r\nsummons. The number of these was indeterminate. The right of the\r\narchbishops, the bishops, and the abbots to be summoned was immemorial\r\nand indisputable, although the abbots in practice evaded their\r\nobligation of attendance, save in cases in which it could be shown\r\nthat as military tenants of the crown they were obligated to perform\r\nparliamentary duty. Among the lay nobility the selection of\r\nindividuals for summons seems originally to have been dependent upon\r\nthe royal pleasure. Eventually, however, the principle became      (p. 023)\r\nfixed that a man once summoned must be summoned whenever occasion\r\nshould arise, and that, furthermore, his eldest son after him must be\r\nsummoned in similar manner. What was at the outset an obligation\r\nbecame in time a privilege and a distinction, and by the day when it\r\ndid so the rule had become legally established that the king could not\r\nwithhold a writ of summons from the heir of a person who had been once\r\nsummoned and had obeyed the summons by taking his seat. During the\r\nfourteenth century the aggregate membership of the chamber fluctuated\r\nin the neighborhood of 150. By reason of the withdrawal of some of the\r\nabbots and the decline of the baronage, in the fifteenth century the\r\nbody was yet smaller. The number of temporal lords summoned to the\r\nfirst parliament of Henry VII. was but 29.\r\n\r\n*24. The House of Commons in 1485.*--The House of Commons at the\r\nbeginning of the Tudor period was a body of some 300 members. It\r\ncontained 74 knights of the shire, representing all but three of the\r\nforty English counties, together with a fluctuating number of\r\nrepresentatives of cities and boroughs. In the Model Parliament of\r\n1295 the number of urban districts represented was 166, but as time\r\nwent on the number declined, in part because of the discrimination\r\nexercised from time to time in the selection of boroughs to be\r\nrepresented, and in part by reason of the fact that in times when\r\nrepresentation did not appear to yield tangible results the borough\r\ntaxpayers begrudged the two shillings per day paid their\r\nrepresentatives, in some instances sufficiently to be induced to\r\nabandon altogether the sending of members. By the time of Edward IV.\r\n(1399-1413) the number of represented towns had fallen to 111. At the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century county members were elected by the\r\nbody of freeholders present at the county court, but by statute of\r\n1429 the electoral privilege was restricted to freeholders resident in\r\nthe county and holding land of the yearly rental value of forty\r\nshillings, equivalent, perhaps, to some £30 to £40 in present values.\r\nThis rule, adopted originally with the express purpose of\r\ndisfranchising \"the very great and outrageous number of people either\r\nof small substance or of no value\" who had been claiming an electoral\r\nequality with the \"worthy knights and squires,\" continued in operation\r\nwithout amendment until 1832. The electoral systems prevailing in the\r\nboroughs exhibited at all times the widest variation, and never prior\r\nto 1832 was there serious attempt to establish uniformity of practice.\r\nIn some places (the so-called \"scot and lot\" boroughs) the suffrage\r\nwas exercised by all rate-payers; in others, by the holders of particular\r\ntenements (\"burgage\" franchise); in others (the \"potwalloper\"      (p. 024)\r\nboroughs) by all citizens who had hearths of their own; in many, by\r\nthe municipal corporation, or by the members of a guild, or even by\r\nneighboring landholders. Borough electoral arrangements ran the full\r\ngamut from thoroughgoing democracy to the narrowest kind of oligarchy.\r\n\r\n*25. Development under the Tudors: Composition.*--During the Tudor\r\nperiod the composition of the two chambers underwent important change.\r\nIn the Lords the principal modification was the substitution of\r\ntemporal for spiritual preponderance. This was brought about in two\r\nways. The first was the increase numerically of the hereditary peers\r\nfrom thirty-six at the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII. to about\r\neighty at the accession of James I. The second was the dropping out of\r\ntwenty-eight abbots, incident to the closing of the monasteries by\r\nHenry VIII. and only partially compensated by the creation at the time\r\nof six new bishoprics. In 1509 the number of lords spiritual was\r\nforty-eight; in 1603, it was but twenty-six. The House of Commons\r\nunder the Tudors was virtually doubled in size. The final\r\nincorporation of Wales in 1535 meant the adding of twenty-five\r\nmembers. In 1536 and 1543 the counties of Monmouth and Chester were\r\nadmitted to representation. There followed the enfranchisement of a\r\nnumber of boroughs, and by the end of the reign of Henry VIII. the\r\nrepresentation of counties had been increased from 74 to 90, and that\r\nof the boroughs had been brought up to 252, giving the House an\r\naggregate membership of 342. During the reign of Edward VI. twenty new\r\nconstituencies were created, and during that of Mary twenty-one. But\r\nthe most notable increase was that which took place in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, the net result of which was the bringing in of 62 new\r\nborough representatives, in some cases from boroughs which now\r\nacquired for the first time the right of representation, in others\r\nfrom boroughs which once had possessed the right but through disuse\r\nhad been construed to have forfeited it. The total increase of the\r\nCommons in numerical strength during the Tudor period was 166. There\r\ncan be little question that in a few instances parliamentary\r\nrepresentation was extended with the specific purpose of influencing\r\nthe political complexion of the popular chamber. But, on the whole,\r\nthe reason for the notable increase, especially of borough members, is\r\nto be found in the growing prosperity of the country and in the\r\nreliance which the Tudors were accustomed to place upon the commercial\r\nand industrial classes of the population.\r\n\r\n*26. Other Developments.*--A second point at which Parliament in the\r\nTudor era underwent modification was in respect to permanence and\r\nsittings. Prior to Henry VIII. the life of a parliament was confined,\r\nas a rule, to a single session, and sessions were brief. But       (p. 025)\r\nparliaments now ceased to be meetings to be broken up as soon as some\r\nspecific piece of business should have been completed, and many were\r\nbrought together in several succeeding sessions. Henry VIII.'s\r\nReformation Parliament lasted seven years. During the forty-five years\r\nof Elizabeth there were ten parliaments and thirteen sessions. One of\r\nthese parliaments lasted eleven years, although it met but three\r\ntimes. It is true that the parliaments of Elizabeth were in session,\r\nin the aggregate, somewhat less than three years, an average for the\r\nreign of but little more than three weeks a year. But the point is\r\nthat, slowly but effectually, Parliament as an institution was\r\nacquiring a recognized position in the political system of the nation.\r\nIn 1589 Thomas Smith, a court secretary, published a book entitled\r\n\"The Commonwealth of England and the Manner of Government Thereof,\" in\r\nwhich was laid down the fundamental proposition that \"the most high\r\nand absolute power of the realm of England consisteth in the\r\nparliament\"; and there is no record that the proclamation of this\r\ndoctrine, even by a court official, elicited serious protest or\r\ndifference of opinion. It was in the Tudor period, further, that both\r\nhouses instituted the keeping of journals and that the appointment of\r\ncommittees and numerous other aspects of modern parliamentary\r\nprocedure had their beginnings.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Elizabethan portion of the period was an epoch during\r\nwhich there took place a very real growth in independence of sentiment\r\nand an equally notable advance in consciousness of power on the part\r\nof the popular chamber. Even before the death of Elizabeth there were\r\nill-repressed manifestations of the feeling that the Tudor monarchy\r\nhad done its work and that the time for a larger amount of\r\nparliamentary control had arrived. Nothing was clearer in 1603 than\r\nthe fact that the sovereign who should expect to get on agreeably with\r\nhis Commons must be both liberal and tactful. That the Stuarts\r\npossessed the first of these qualities in only a very limited measure\r\nand the second one not at all is a fact upon which turns an entire\r\nchapter of English constitutional history.[21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21: Excellent works of a general nature\r\n                   on the Tudor period are H.

Absolutism Becomes Impracticable.*--Throughout the larger portion\r\nof the seventeenth century the principal interest in English politics\r\ncenters in the contest which was waged between the nation represented\r\nin Parliament and the sovereigns of the Stuart dynasty. The question,\r\nas one writer has put it, was \"at first whether government should be\r\nby the king or by the king in parliament, afterwards whether the king\r\nshould govern or whether parliament should govern.\"[22] The Stuart\r\nsovereigns brought with them to the English throne no political\r\nprinciples that were new. When James I., in a speech before Parliament\r\nMarch 21, 1610, declared that monarchy \"is the supremest thing upon\r\nearth,\" and that, \"as to dispute what God may do is blasphemy, ... so\r\nis it sedition in subjects to dispute what a King may do in the height\r\nof his power,\"[23] he was but giving expression to a conception of the\r\nroyal prerogative which had been lodged in the mind of every Tudor,\r\nbut which no Tudor had been so tactless as publicly to avow. The first\r\ntwo Stuarts confidently expected to maintain the same measure of\r\nabsolutism which their Tudor predecessors had maintained--nothing\r\nmore, nothing less. There were, however, several reasons why, for\r\nthem, this was an impossibility. The first arose from their own\r\ntemperament. The bluntness, the lack of perception of the public will,\r\nand the disposition perpetually to insist upon the minutest\r\ndefinitions of prerogative, which so pre-eminently characterized the\r\nmembers of the Stuart house must have operated to alienate\r\nseventeenth-century Englishmen under even the most favorable of\r\ncircumstances. A second consideration is the fact, of which the nation\r\nwas fully cognizant, that under the changed conditions that had arisen\r\nthere was no longer the need of strong monarchy that once there had\r\nbeen. Law and order had long since been secured; all danger of a\r\nfeudal reaction had been effectually removed; foreign invasion was no\r\nmore to be feared. Strong monarchy had served an invaluable purpose,\r\nbut that purpose had been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22: C. Ilbert, Parliament, its History,\r\n                   Constitution, and Practice (London and New York,\r\n                   1911), 28-29.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23: Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional\r\n                   Documents, 293-294.]\r\n\r\n*28. The Rights of the Commons Asserted.*--Finally there was the   (p. 027)\r\nfact of the enormous growth of Parliament as an organ of the public\r\nwill. The rapidity of that development in the days of Elizabeth is,\r\nand was at the time, much obscured by the disposition of the nation to\r\npermit the Queen to live out her days without being seriously crossed\r\nin her purposes. But the magnitude of it becomes apparent enough after\r\n1603. In a remarkable document known as the Apology of the Commons,\r\nunder date of June 20, 1604, the popular chamber stated respectfully\r\nbut frankly to the new sovereign what it considered to be its rights\r\nand, through it, the rights of the nation. \"What cause we your poor\r\nCommons have,\" runs the address, \"to watch over our privileges, is\r\nmanifest in itself to all men. The prerogatives of princes may easily,\r\nand do daily, grow; the privileges of the subject are for the most\r\npart at an everlasting stand. They may be by good providence and care\r\npreserved, but being once lost are not recovered but with much\r\ndisquiet. The rights and liberties of the Commons of England\r\nconsisteth chiefly in these three things: first, that the shires,\r\ncities, and boroughs of England, by representation to be present, have\r\nfree choice of such persons as they shall put in trust to represent\r\nthem; secondly, that the persons chosen, during the time of the\r\nparliament, as also of their access and recess, be free from\r\nrestraint, arrest, and imprisonment: thirdly, that in parliament they\r\nmay speak freely their consciences without check and controlment,\r\ndoing the same with due reverence to the sovereign court of\r\nparliament, that is, to your Majesty and both the Houses, who all in\r\nthis case make but one politic body, whereof your Highness is the\r\nhead.\"[24] The shrewdness of the political philosophy with which this\r\npassage opens is matched only by the terseness with which the\r\nfundamental rights of the Commons as a body are enumerated. To the\r\nenumeration should be added, historically, an item contained in a\r\npetition of the Commons, May 23, 1610, which reads as follows: \"We\r\nhold it an ancient, general, and undoubted right of Parliament to\r\ndebate freely all matters which do properly concern the subject and\r\nhis right or state; which freedom of debate being once foreclosed, the\r\nessence of the liberty of Parliament is withal dissolved.\"[25] The\r\noccasion for this last-mentioned assertion of right arose from the\r\nking's habitual assumption that there were various important matters\r\nof state, e.g., the laying of impositions and the conduct of foreign\r\nrelations, which Parliament possessed no right so much as to discuss.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24: Petyt, Jus Parliamentarium (London,\r\n                   1739), 227-243. Portions of this document are\r\n                   printed in Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional\r\n                   Documents, 286-293.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 25: Commons' Journals, I., 431; Prothero,\r\n                   Statutes, 297.]\r\n\r\n*29. The Parliaments of James I. and Charles I.*--The tyranny of   (p. 028)\r\nJames I. and Charles I. assumed the form, principally, of the issue of\r\nproclamations without the warrant of statute and the exaction of taxes\r\nwithout the assent of Parliament. Parliament, during the period\r\n1603-1640, was convened but seldom, and it was repeatedly prorogued or\r\ndissolved to terminate its inquiries, thwart its protests, or subvert\r\nits projected measures. Under the disadvantage of recurrent\r\ninterruption the Commons contrived, however, to carry on a contest\r\nwith the crown which was essentially continuous. During the reign of\r\nJames I. (1603-1625) there were four parliaments. The first, extending\r\nfrom 1604 to 1611, was called in session six times. It sorely\r\ndispleased the king by remonstrating against his measures, and\r\nespecially by the persistency with which it withheld subsidies pending\r\na redress of grievances. The second, summoned in 1614, vainly\r\nreiterated the complaints of its predecessor and was dissolved without\r\nhaving enacted a single measure. The third, in 1621, revived the power\r\nof impeachment (dormant since the days of Henry VII.), reasserted the\r\nright of the chambers to debate foreign relations, and avenged by a\r\nfresh protestation of liberties the arrest of one of its members. The\r\nfourth, in 1624, abolished monopolies and renewed the attack upon\r\nproclamations. The first parliament of Charles I., convoked in 1625,\r\ncriticised the policy of the new sovereign and was dissolved. The\r\nsecond, in 1626, was dissolved to prevent the impeachment of the\r\nking's favorite minister, the Duke of Buckingham. The third, in\r\n1628-1629, drew up the memorable Petition of Right, to which the king\r\ngave reluctant assent, and in which arbitrary imprisonment, the\r\nbilleting of soldiers, the establishment of martial law in time of\r\npeace, and the imposition of gifts, loans, benevolences, or taxes\r\nwithout the consent of Parliament were specifically prohibited.[26]\r\nThe fourth of Charles's parliaments, the so-called Short Parliament of\r\n1640, followed a period of eleven years of personal government and\r\nshowed no disposition to surrender the rights that had been asserted.\r\nThe fifth--the Long Parliament, convoked also in 1640--imprisoned and\r\nexecuted the king's principal advisers, abolished the Star Chamber and\r\nthe several other special courts and councils of Tudor origin,\r\npronounced illegal the levy of ship-money and of tonnage and poundage\r\nwithout parliamentary assent, made provision for the assembling of a\r\nparliament within three years of the dissolution of the present one,\r\nand forced the king into a position where he was obliged to yield or\r\nto resort to war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 26: The text of the Petition of Right is\r\n                   printed in Stubbs, Select Charters, 515-517; Adams\r\n                   and Stephens, Select Documents, 339-342.]\r\n\r\n*30. The Commonwealth and the Protectorate.*--Between the          (p. 029)\r\npolitical theory maintained by the Stuart kings and that maintained by\r\nthe parliamentary majority it was found impossible to arrive at a\r\ncompromise. The Civil War was waged, in the last analysis, to\r\ndetermine which of the two theories should prevail. It should be\r\nemphasized that the parliamentarians entered upon the contest with no\r\nintent to establish a government by Parliament alone, in form or in\r\nfact. It is sufficiently clear from the Grand Remonstrance of 1641[27]\r\nthat what they contemplated was merely the imposing of constitutional\r\nrestrictions upon the crown, together with the introduction of certain\r\nspecific changes in the political and ecclesiastical order, e.g., the\r\nabolition of episcopacy. The culmination of the struggle, however, in\r\nthe defeat and execution of the king threw open the doors for every\r\nsort of constitutional innovation, and between 1649 and 1660 the\r\nnation was called upon to pass through an era of political\r\nexperimentation happily unparalleled in its history. May 19, 1649,\r\nkingship and the House of Lords having been abolished as equally\r\n\"useless and dangerous,\"[28] Parliament, to complete the work of\r\ntransformation, proclaimed a commonwealth, or republic; and on the\r\ngreat seal was inscribed the legend, \"In the first year of freedom by\r\nGod's blessing restored.\" During the continuance of the Commonwealth\r\n(1649-1654) various plans were brought forward for the creation of a\r\nparliament elected by manhood suffrage, but with the essential\r\nprinciple involved neither the Rump nor the people at large possessed\r\nsubstantial sympathy. In 1654 there was put in operation a\r\nconstitution--the earliest among written constitutions in modern\r\nEurope--known as the Instrument of Government.[29] The system therein\r\nprovided, which was intended to be extended to the three countries of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland, comprised as the executive power a\r\nlife Protector, to be assisted by a council of thirteen to twenty-one\r\nmembers, and as the legislative organ a unicameral parliament of 460\r\nmembers elected triennially by all citizens possessing property to the\r\nvalue of £300.[30] Cromwell accepted the office of Protector, and the\r\nensuing six years comprise the period known commonly as the        (p. 030)\r\nProtectorate.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 27: S.

Between Cromwell and his parliaments relations were much\r\nof the time notoriously strained, and especially was there controversy\r\nas to whether the powers of Parliament should be construed to extend\r\nto the revision of the constitution. In 1657 the Protector was asked\r\nto assume the title of king. This he refused to do, but he did accept\r\na new constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice, in which a step\r\nwas taken toward a return to the governmental system swept away in\r\n1649.[31] This step comprised, principally, the re-establishment of a\r\nparliament of two chambers--a House of Commons and, for lack of\r\nagreement upon a better designation, \"the Other House.\" Republicanism,\r\nhowever, failed to strike root. Shrewder men, including Cromwell, had\r\nrecognized all the while that the English people were really royalist\r\nat heart, and it is not too much to say that from the outset the\r\nrestoration of monarchy was inevitable. Even before the death of\r\nCromwell, in 1658, the trend was distinctly in that direction, and\r\nafter the hand of the great Protector had been removed from the helm\r\nsuch a consummation was a question but of time and means. May 25,\r\n1660, Charles II., having engaged to grant a general amnesty and to\r\naccept such measures of settlement respecting religion as Parliament\r\nshould determine upon, landed at Dover and was received with all but\r\nuniversal acclamation.[32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 31: Gardiner, Documents of the Puritan\r\n                   Revolution, 447-459.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 32: The best of the general treatises\r\n                   covering the period 1603-1660 are F.

THE LATER STUARTS: THE REVOLUTION OF 1688-1689                 (p. 031)\r\n\r\n*31. Charles II. and James II.*--Throughout the period 1660-1689 there\r\nwas enacted a final grand experiment to determine whether a Stuart\r\ncould, or would, govern constitutionally. The constitution in\r\naccordance with which Charles II. and James II. were expected to\r\ngovern was that which had been built up during preceding centuries,\r\namended by the important reforms effected by the Long Parliament in\r\n1641. The settlement of 1660 was a restoration no less of Parliament\r\nthan of the monarchy, in respect both to structure and to functions.\r\nThe two chambers were re-established upon their earlier foundations,\r\nand in them was vested the power to enact all legislation and to\r\nsanction all taxation. The spirit, if not the letter, of the agreement\r\nin accordance with which the Stuart house was restored forbade the\r\nfurther imposition of taxes by the arbitrary decree of the crown and\r\nall exercise of the legislative power by the crown singly, whether\r\npositively through proclamation or negatively through dispensation. It\r\nrequired that henceforth the nature and amount of public expenditures\r\nshould, upon inquiry, be made known to the two houses, and that\r\nministers might regularly be held to account for their acts and those\r\nof the sovereign. The easy-going Charles II. (1660-1685) contrived\r\nmost of the time to keep fairly within the bounds that were prescribed\r\nfor him. He disliked the religious measures of his first parliament,\r\nbut he recognized that a fresh election might be expected to result in\r\nthe choice of a House of Commons still less to his taste, and,\r\naccordingly, the Cavalier Parliament was kept in existence throughout\r\nthe entire period 1661-1679. The parliamentary history of the closing\r\nyears of the reign centered about the question of the exclusion of the\r\nking's Catholic brother, James, from the throne, and was given special\r\ninterest by the conflict of groups foreshadowing political parties;\r\nbut Charles maintained unfailingly an attitude which, at the least,\r\ndid not endanger his own tenure of the throne.\r\n\r\nJames II. (1685-1688) was a man of essentially different temper. He\r\nwas a Stuart of the Stuarts, irrevocably attached to the doctrine of\r\ndivine right and sufficiently tactless to take no pains to disguise\r\nthe fact. He was able, industrious, and honest, but obstinate and\r\nintolerant. He began by promising to preserve \"the government as by\r\nlaw established.\" But the ease with which the Monmouth uprising of\r\n1685 was suppressed deluded him into thinking that through the\r\nexemption of the Catholics from the operation of existing laws he\r\nmight in time realize his ambition to re-establish Roman Catholicism\r\nin England. He proceeded, therefore, to issue decrees dispensing   (p. 032)\r\nwith statutes which Parliament had enacted, to establish an\r\necclesiastical commission in violation of parliamentary law of 1641,\r\nand, in 1687, to promulgate a declaration of indulgence extending to\r\nall Catholics and Non-Conformists a freedom in religious matters which\r\nwas clearly denied by the laws of the country.[33] By this arbitrary\r\nresumption of ancient prerogative the theory underlying the\r\nRestoration was subverted utterly.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 33: Gee and Hardy, Documents Illustrative\r\n                   of English Church History, 641-644; Adams and\r\n                   Stephens, Select Documents, 451-454.]\r\n\r\n*32. The Revolution: the Bill of Rights.*--Foreseeing no relief from\r\nabsolutist practices, and impelled especially by the birth, in 1688,\r\nof a male heir to the king, a group of leading men representing the\r\nvarious political groups extended to the stadtholder of Holland,\r\nWilliam, Prince of Orange, an invitation to repair to England to\r\nuphold and protect the constitutional liberties of the realm. The\r\nresult was the bloodless revolution of 1688. November 5, William\r\nlanded at Torquay and advanced toward London. James, finding himself\r\nwithout a party, offered vain concessions and afterwards fled to the\r\ncourt of his ally, Louis XIV. of France. By a provisional body of\r\nlords, former commoners, and officials William was requested to act as\r\ntemporary \"governor\" until the people should have chosen a national\r\n\"convention.\"[34] This convention assembled January 22, 1689, resolved\r\nthat James, by reason of his flight, should be construed to have\r\nabdicated, and established on the throne as joint sovereigns William\r\nand Mary, with the understanding that the actual government of the\r\nrealm should devolve upon the king.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 34: Not properly a parliament, because\r\n                   not summoned by a king.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1688-1689 was signalized by the putting into written\r\nform of no inconsiderable portion of the English constitution as it\r\nthen existed. February 19, 1698, the new sovereigns formally accepted\r\na Declaration of Right, drawn up by the convention, and by act of\r\nParliament, December 16 following, this instrument, under the name of\r\nthe Bill of Rights, was made a part of the law of the land. In it were\r\ndenied specifically a long list of prerogatives to which the last\r\nStuart had laid claim--those, in particular, of dispensing with the\r\nlaws, establishing ecclesiastical commissions, levying imposts without\r\nparliamentary assent, and maintaining a standing army under the\r\nexclusive control of the crown. In it also were guaranteed certain\r\nfundamental rights which during the controversies of the seventeenth\r\ncentury had been brought repeatedly in question, including those of\r\npetition, freedom of elections, and freedom of speech on the part  (p. 033)\r\nof members of Parliament.[35] The necessity of frequent meetings\r\nof Parliament was affirmed, and a succession clause was inserted by\r\nwhich Roman Catholics and persons who should marry Roman Catholics,\r\nwere excluded from the throne. In the Bill of Rights were thus summed\r\nup the essential results of the Revolution, and, more remotely, of the\r\nentire seventeenth-century parliamentary movement. With its enactment\r\nthe doctrine of divine right disappeared forever from the domain of\r\npractical English politics. The entire circumstance of William III.'s\r\naccession determined the royal tenure to be, as it thereafter\r\nremained, not by inherent or vested right, but conditioned upon the\r\nnational will.[36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 35: In this connection should be recalled\r\n                   the Habeas Corpus Act of May 26, 1679, by whose\r\n                   terms the right of an individual, upon arrest, to\r\n                   have his case investigated without delay was\r\n                   effectually guaranteed.

CROWN AND PARLIAMENT AFTER 1789\r\n\r\n*33. Elements of Stability and Change.*--Structurally, the English\r\ngovernmental system was by the close of the seventeenth century\r\nsubstantially complete. The limited monarchy, the ministry, the two\r\nhouses of parliament, the courts of law, and the local administrative\r\nagencies were by that time constituted very much as they are to-day.\r\nThe fundamental principles, furthermore, upon which English government\r\nis operated were securely established. Laws could be enacted only by\r\n\"the king in parliament\"; taxes could be levied only in the same\r\nmanner; the liberty of the individual was safeguarded by a score of\r\nspecific and oft-renewed guarantees. In point of fact, however, the\r\nEnglish constitution of 1689 was very far from being the English\r\nconstitution of 1912. The overturn by which the last Stuart was driven\r\nfrom the throne not only marked the culmination of the revolution\r\ncommenced in 1640; it comprised the beginning of a more extended\r\nrevolution, peaceful but thoroughgoing, by which the governmental\r\nsystem of the realm was amplified, carried in new directions, and\r\nsuccessively readapted to fresh and changing conditions. At no time\r\nfrom William III. to George V. was there a deliberate overhauling of\r\nthe governmental system as a whole. Save in occasional parliamentary\r\nenactments and judicial decisions, the constitutional changes which\r\nwere wrought were rarely given documentary expression. Yet it is\r\nhardly too much to say that of the principles and practices which\r\nto-day make up the working constitution of the United Kingdom almost\r\nall were originated or reshaped during the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies. In describing, in succeeding chapters, the principal\r\naspects of this governmental system it will be necessary frequently to\r\nallude to these more recent constitutional developments, and it would\r\nbut involve repetition to undertake an account of them at this point.\r\nAn enumeration and a brief characterization of a few of the more\r\nimportant will serve for the moment to impress the importance\r\nconstitutionally of the period under consideration.\r\n\r\n*34. The Decreased Authority of the Crown.*--First may be          (p. 035)\r\nmentioned the gradual eclipse of the crown and the establishment of\r\ncomplete and unquestioned ascendancy on the part of Parliament. In\r\nconsequence of the Revolution of 1688-1689 the sovereign was shorn\r\ndefinitely of a number of important prerogatives. William III.,\r\nhowever, was no figure-head, and the crown was far from having been\r\nreduced to impotence. Understanding perfectly the conditions upon\r\nwhich he had been received in England, William none the less did not\r\nattempt to conceal his innate love of power. He claimed prerogatives\r\nwhich his Whig supporters were loath to acknowledge and he exercised\r\nhabitually in person, and with telling effect, the functions of\r\nsovereign, premier, foreign minister, and military autocrat.[37] His\r\nsuccessor, Anne, though apathetic, was hardly less attached to the\r\ninterests of strong monarchy. It was only with the accession of the\r\nHanoverian dynasty, in 1714, that the bulk of those powers of\r\ngovernment which hitherto the crown had retained slipped inevitably\r\ninto the grasp of the ministers and of Parliament. George I.\r\n(1714-1727) and George II. (1727-1760) were not the nonentities they\r\nhave been painted, but, being alien alike to English speech, customs,\r\nand political institutions, they were in a position to defend but\r\nindifferently the prerogatives which they had inherited. Under George\r\nIII. (1760-1820) there was a distinct recrudescence of the monarchical\r\nidea. The king, if obstinate and below the average intellectually, was\r\nhonest, courageous, and ambitious. He gloried in the name of\r\nEnglishman, and, above all, he was determined to recover for the crown\r\nsome measure of the prestige and authority which his predecessors had\r\nlost. The increasingly oligarchical character of Parliament in the\r\nperiod and the disintegration of the ruling Whig party created a\r\ncondition not unfavorable for the realization of the royal programme,\r\nand through at least a score of years the influence which the\r\nsovereign exerted personally upon government and politics exceeded\r\nanything that had been known since the days of William III. In 1780\r\nthe House of Commons gave expression to its apprehension by adopting a\r\nseries of resolutions, the first of which asserted unequivocally that\r\n\"the influence of the crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to\r\nbe diminished.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 37: On the constitution as it was at the\r\n                   death of William III., see Maitland, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, 281-329.]\r\n\r\nAfter the retirement of Lord North, in 1782, however, the influence of\r\nthe sovereign declined perceptibly, and during the later portion of\r\nthe reign, clouded by the king's insanity, all that had been gained\r\nfor royalty was again lost. Under the Regency (1810-1820) and during\r\nthe reign of the reactionary and scandal-smirched George IV.       (p. 036)\r\n(1820-1830) the popularity, if not the power, of the crown reached its\r\nnadir. In the days of the genial William IV. (1830-1837) popularity\r\nwas regained, but not power. The long reign of the virtuous Victoria\r\n(1837-1901) served completely to rehabilitate the monarchy in the\r\nrespect and affections of the British people, a consummation whose\r\nstability more recent sovereigns have done nothing to impair. As will\r\nbe pointed out in another place, the influence which the sovereign may\r\nwield, and during the past three-quarters of a century has wielded, in\r\nthe actual conduct of public affairs is far from inconsiderable. But,\r\nas will also be emphasized, that influence is but the shadow of the\r\nauthority which the crown once--even as late as the opening of the\r\neighteenth century--possessed. It is largely personal rather than\r\nlegal; it is asserted within the domain of foreign relations rather\r\nmore than within that of domestic affairs; and as against the adverse\r\nwill of the nation expressed through Parliament it is, in effect,\r\npowerless.[38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 38: On the monarchical revival under\r\n                   George III., see D.

Holland, 3 vols.\r\n                   (London, 1912), I., Chaps. 1-2.]\r\n\r\n*35. Ascendancy of the House of Commons.*--A second transformation\r\nwrought in the working constitution since 1689 is the shifting of the\r\ncenter of gravity in Parliament from the House of Lords to the House\r\nof Commons, together with a notable democratizing of the\r\nrepresentative chamber. In the days of William and Anne the House of\r\nLords was distinctly more dignified and influential than the House of\r\nCommons. During the period covered by the ministry of Walpole\r\n(1721-1742), however, the Commons rose rapidly to the position of the\r\npreponderating legislative branch. One contributing cause was the\r\nSeptennial Act of 1716, whereby the life of a parliament was extended\r\nfrom three years to seven, thus increasing the continuity and\r\ndesirability of membership in the Commons. Another was the growing\r\nimportance of the power of the purse as wielded by the Commons. A\r\nthird was the fact that Walpole, throughout his prolonged ministry,\r\nsat steadily as a member of the lower chamber and made it the scene of\r\nhis remarkable activities. The establishment of the supremacy of the\r\nCommons as then constructed did not, however, mean the triumph of\r\npopular government. It was but a step toward that end. The House of\r\nCommons in the eighteenth century was composed of members elected  (p. 037)\r\nin the counties and boroughs upon a severely restricted franchise or\r\nappointed outright by closed corporations or by individual magnates,\r\nand it remained for Parliament during the nineteenth century, by a\r\nseries of memorable statutes, to extend the franchise successively to\r\ngroups of people hitherto politically powerless, to reapportion\r\nparliamentary seats so that political influence might be distributed\r\nwith some fairness among the voters, and to regulate the conditions\r\nunder which campaigns should be carried on, elections conducted, and\r\nother operations of popular government undertaken. Of principal\r\nimportance among the enactments by which these things were\r\naccomplished are the Reform Act of 1832, the Representation of the\r\nPeople Act of 1867, the Ballot Act of 1872, the Corrupt and Illegal\r\nPractices Act of 1883, the Representation of the People Act of 1884,\r\nand the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885. The nature of these\r\nmeasures will be explained subsequently.[39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 39: See pp. 80-86.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. RISE OF THE CABINET AND OF POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*36. Cabinet Origins.*--In the third place, the period under review is\r\nimportant by reason of the development within it of the most\r\nremarkable feature of the English constitutional system to-day,\r\nnamely, the cabinet. The creation of the cabinet was a gradual\r\nprocess, and both the process and the product are utterly unknown to\r\nthe letter of English law. It is customary to regard as the immediate\r\nantecedent of the cabinet the so-called \"cabal\" of Charles II., i.e.,\r\nthe irregular group of persons whom that sovereign selected from the\r\nPrivy Council and took advice from informally in lieu of the Council\r\nitself. In point of fact, by reason principally of the growing\r\nunwieldiness of the Privy Council, the practice of deferring for\r\nadvice to a specially constituted committee, or inner circle, of the\r\nbody far antedated Charles II. By some it has been traced to a period\r\nas remote as the reign of Henry III., and it is known that not only\r\nthe thing itself, but also the name \"cabinet council,\" existed under\r\nCharles I. The essential justification of the creation of the cabinet\r\nwas stated by Charles II. in 1679 in the declaration that \"the great\r\nnumber of the Council has made it unfit for the secrecy and despatch\r\nthat are necessary in many great affairs.\" The growing authority of\r\nthe select circle of advisors was the object of repeated attacks, and\r\nthe name \"cabinet\" (arising from the king's habit of receiving the\r\nmembers in a small private room, or cabinet, in the royal palace) was\r\napplied at first as a term of reproach. The device met, however, a\r\ngenuine need, and by 1689 its perpetuation was assured. The larger (p. 038)\r\nPrivy Council was continued in existence, and it exists to-day; but\r\nits powers became long ago merely nominal.[40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 40: H. W. V. Temperley, The Inner and\r\n                   Outer Cabinet and the Privy Council, 1679-1683, in\r\n                   _English Historical Review_, Oct., 1912.]\r\n\r\n*37. Principles of Cabinet Government Established.*--Under William III.\r\nthe cabinet took on rapidly the character which it bears to-day.\r\nFailing in the attempt to govern with a cabinet including both Whigs\r\nand Tories, William, in 1693-1696, gathered about himself a body of\r\nadvisers composed exclusively of Whigs, and the principle speedily\r\nbecame established for all time that a cabinet group must be made up\r\nof men who in respect to all important matters of state are in\r\nsubstantial agreement. Before the close of the eighteenth century\r\nthere had been fixed definitely the conception of the cabinet as a\r\nbody necessarily consisting (a) of members of Parliament (b) of the\r\nsame political views (c) chosen from the party possessing a majority\r\nin the House of Commons (d) prosecuting a concerted policy (e) under a\r\ncommon responsibility to be signified by collective resignation in the\r\nevent of parliamentary censure, and (f) acknowledging a common\r\nsubordination to one chief minister.[41] During the eighteenth-century\r\nera of royal weakness the cabinet acquired a measure of independence\r\nby which it was enabled to become, for all practical purposes, the\r\nruling authority of the realm; and, under the limitation of strict\r\naccountability to the House of Commons, it fulfills substantially that\r\nfunction to-day. Its members, as will appear, are at the same time the\r\nheads of the principal executive departments, the leaders in the\r\nlegislative chambers, and the authors of very nearly the whole of\r\ngovernmental policy and conduct.[42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 41: H. D. Traill, Central Government\r\n                   (London, 1881), 24-25.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 42: On the rise of the cabinet see, in\r\n                   addition to the general histories, M.

Beginnings of Political Parties.*--A fourth phase of governmental\r\ndevelopment within the period under survey is the rise of political\r\nparties and the fixing of the broader aspects of the present party\r\nsystem. In no nation to-day does party play a rôle of larger\r\nimportance than in Great Britain. Unknown to the written portions of\r\nthe constitution, and all but unknown to the ordinary law, party\r\nmanagement and party operations are, none the less, of constant and\r\nfundamental importance in the actual conduct of government. The\r\norigins of political parties in England fall clearly within the\r\nseventeenth century. It was the judgment of Macaulay that the      (p. 039)\r\nearliest of groups to which the designation of political parties can\r\nbe applied were the Cavalier and Roundhead elements as aligned after\r\nthe adoption of the Grand Remonstrance by the Long Parliament in 1641.\r\nThe first groups, however, which may be thought of as essentially\r\nanalogous to the political parties of the present day, possessing\r\ncontinuity, fixity of principles, and some degree of compactness of\r\norganization, were the Whigs and Tories of the era of Charles II.\r\nDividing in the first instance upon the issue of the exclusion of\r\nJames, these two elements, with the passage of time, assumed\r\nwell-defined and fundamentally irreconcilable positions upon the\r\nessential public questions of the day. Broadly, the Whigs stood for\r\ntoleration in religion and for parliamentary supremacy in government;\r\nthe Tories for Anglicanism and the prerogative. And long after the\r\nStuart monarchy was a thing of the past these two great parties kept\r\nup their struggles upon these and other issues. After an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to govern with the co-operation of both parties William III.,\r\nas has been pointed out, fell back definitely upon the support of the\r\nWhigs. At the accession of Queen Anne, in 1702, however, the Whigs\r\nwere turned out of office and the Tories (who already had had a taste\r\nof power in 1698-1701) were put in control. They retained office\r\nduring the larger portion of Queen Anne's reign, but at the accession\r\nof George I. they were compelled to give place to their rivals, and\r\nthe period 1714-1761 was one of unbroken Whig ascendancy. This was, of\r\ncourse, the period of the development of the cabinet system, and\r\nbetween the rise of that system and the growth of government by party\r\nthere was an intimate and inevitable connection. By the close of the\r\neighteenth century the rule had become inflexible that the cabinet\r\nshould be composed of men who were in sympathy with the party at the\r\ntime dominant in the House of Commons, and that the returning by the\r\nnation to the representative chamber of a majority adverse to the\r\nruling ministry should be followed by the retirement of the\r\nministry.[43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 43: For references on the history of\r\n                   English political parties see pp. 144, 160, 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE SCOTTISH AND IRISH UNIONS\r\n\r\n*39. The Union with Scotland, 1707.*--Finally may be mentioned the\r\nimportant changes in the governmental structure which arose from the\r\nAct of Union with Scotland, in 1707, and the Act of Union with\r\nIreland, in 1801. Except during a brief portion of the period of the\r\nProtectorate, the legal relation of England and Wales, on the one\r\nside, and the kingdom of Scotland, on the other, was from 1603 to  (p. 040)\r\n1707 that simply of a personal union through the crown. Scotland had\r\nher own parliament, her own established church, her own laws, her own\r\ncourts, her own army, and her own system of finance. By the Act of\r\n1707 a union was established of a far more substantial sort. The two\r\ncountries were erected into a single kingdom, known henceforth as\r\nGreat Britain. The Scottish parliament was abolished and representation\r\nwas accorded the Scottish nobility and people in the British\r\nparliament at Westminster. The quota of commoners was fixed at\r\nforty-five (thirty to be chosen by the counties and fifteen by the\r\nboroughs) and that of peers (to be elected by the entire body of\r\nScottish peers at the beginning of each parliament) at sixteen. All\r\nlaws respecting trade, excises, and customs were required to be\r\nuniform throughout the two countries, but the local laws of Scotland\r\nupon other subjects were continued in operation, subject to revision\r\nby the common parliament. The Scottish judicial system remained\r\nunchanged;[44] likewise the status of the established Presbyterian\r\nChurch.[45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 44: Save that appeals might be carried\r\n                   from the Scottish Court of Session to the House of\r\n                   Lords.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 45: J. Mackinnon, The Union of England\r\n                   and Scotland (London, 1896). This scholarly volume\r\n                   covers principally the period 1695-1745.]\r\n\r\n*40. The Union with Ireland, 1801.*--The history of Ireland, in most of\r\nits phases, is that of a conquered territory, and until late in the\r\neighteenth century the constitutional status of the country\r\napproximated, most of the time, that of a crown colony. During the\r\nMiddle Ages the Common Law and the institutions of England were\r\nintroduced in the settled portions of the island (the Pale), and a\r\nparliament of the English type began to be developed; but Poynings's\r\nLaw of 1494, by requiring the assent of the English king and council\r\nfor the convening of an Irish parliament, by enjoining that all bills\r\nconsidered by the Irish parliament must first have been considered by\r\nthe English parliament, and by declaring all existing statutes of the\r\nEnglish parliament to be binding upon Ireland, effectually stifled,\r\nuntil its repeal in 1782, Irish parliamentary development. From the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century Catholics were debarred from\r\nmembership, and, from the early eighteenth, from voting at\r\nparliamentary elections. The repeal of Poynings's Law in 1782 and the\r\nremoval of the Catholic disqualification ten years later bettered the\r\nsituation, yet at the close of the eighteenth century Irish\r\ngovernmental arrangements were still very unsatisfactory. Parliament\r\nwas independent in the making of laws, but not in the control of\r\nadministration; and it was in no true sense a national and representative\r\nbody. The policy urged by Pitt, namely, the establishment of a     (p. 041)\r\nlegislative union on the plan of that which already existed between\r\nEngland and Scotland, gradually impressed itself upon the members of\r\nParliament as more feasible than any other.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Union creating the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland\" was adopted by the Irish parliament in February, 1800, and by\r\nthe British parliament five months later, and, January 1, 1801, it was\r\nput in operation. Under the terms of this measure the Irish parliament\r\nwas abolished, and it was arranged that Ireland should be represented\r\nin the common parliament[46] by four spiritual lords and twenty-eight\r\ntemporal peers, chosen by the Irish peerage for life, and by one\r\nhundred members (sixty-four sitting for counties, thirty-five for\r\nboroughs, and one for the University of Dublin) of the House of\r\nCommons. The Anglican Church of Ireland was amalgamated with the\r\nestablished Church of England, though, subsequently in 1869, it was\r\ndisestablished and disendowed. The union with Ireland was in the\r\nnature of a contract, and while in a number of respects the conditions\r\nwhich were involved in it have been altered within the past hundred\r\nyears, its fundamentals stand to-day unchanged. It is these\r\nfundamentals, especially the assimilation of Ireland with Great\r\nBritain for legislative purposes, which are the object of relentless\r\nattack on the part of the Home Rule and other nationalistic and\r\nreforming elements.[47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 46: Styled \"the Parliament of the United\r\n                   Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 47: An abridgment of the text of the Act\r\n                   of Union with Scotland is printed in Adams and\r\n                   Stephens, Select Documents, 479-483; of that of the\r\n                   Act of Union with Ireland, ibid., 497-506.

THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n*41. The Elusiveness of the Constitution.*--The description of the\r\nBritish governmental system which is hereafter to be undertaken will\r\nbe clarified by a word of comment at this point upon the character\r\nwhich the English constitution of to-day has assumed, upon the form in\r\nwhich it exists, and upon the sources from which it has been drawn.\r\nThe term \"constitution,\" as is familiarly understood, may be employed\r\nto denote a written instrument of fundamental law which has been\r\nframed by a constituent assembly, drafted by an ordinary legislative\r\nbody, or promulgated upon the sole authority of a dictator or monarch;\r\nor, with equal propriety, it may be used to designate a body of    (p. 042)\r\ncustoms, laws, and precedents, but partially, or even not at all,\r\ncommitted to writing, in accordance with which the machinery of a\r\ngiven governmental system is operated. The constitution of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland is of this second type. The\r\nstudent who desires to bring together the principles and to tabulate\r\nthe working details of the British constitutional order will find no\r\nsingle document, nor any collection of documents, in which these\r\nthings are wholly, or even largely, set down. For the accomplishment\r\nof such a task it would be necessary to review intensively a thousand\r\nyears and more of history, to lay hold of a statute here and of a\r\njudicial decision there, to take constant cognizance of the rise and\r\ncrystallization of political usages, and to probe to their inmost\r\nrecesses the mechanisms of administration, law-making, taxation,\r\nelections, and judicial procedure as they have been, and as they are\r\nactually operated before the spectator's eyes. Foremost among its\r\ncompeers in antiquity, in comprehensiveness, and in originality, the\r\nBritish constitution is at once the least tangible and the most widely\r\ninfluential among European bodies of fundamental law.\r\n\r\n*42. Constituent Elements: the Law.*--The elements of which this\r\nconstitution is to-day composed have been classified in various ways.\r\nFor present purposes they may be gathered in five principal\r\ncategories. In the first place, there are treaties and other\r\ninternational agreements, which in Great Britain as in the United\r\nStates are invested with the character of supreme law of the land. In\r\nthe second place, there is a group of solemn engagements which have\r\nbeen entered into at times of national crisis between parties\r\nrepresenting opposed, or contracting, political forces. Of such\r\ncharacter are the Great Charter, the Petition of Right, and the Bill\r\nof Rights. A third and larger category comprises parliamentary\r\nstatutes which add to or modify governmental powers or procedure.\r\nStatutes of this type include clearly the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679,\r\nthe Act of Settlement of 1701, the Septennial Act of 1716, Fox's Libel\r\nAct of 1792, the Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884, the Municipal\r\nCorporations Act of 1835, the Parliamentary and Municipal Elections\r\nAct of 1872, the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894, and the\r\nParliament Act of 1911. In the fourth place there is the Common Law, a\r\nvast body of legal precept and usage which through the centuries has\r\nacquired fundamental and immutable character. The first three elements\r\nmentioned, i.e., treaties, solemn political engagements, and\r\nstatutes, exist solely, or almost so, in written form. The rules of\r\nthe Common Law, however, have not been reduced to writing, save in so\r\nfar as they are contained in reports, legal opinions, and, more\r\nparticularly, authoritative decisions of the courts, such as those (p. 043)\r\non the rights of jurymen, on the prerogative of the crown, on the\r\nprivileges of the houses of Parliament and of their members, and on\r\nthe rights and duties of the police.\r\n\r\n*43. Constituent Elements: the Conventions.*--Finally, there are those\r\nportions of the constitution which have been denominated with aptness\r\nby Mr. Dicey \"the conventions.\"[48] The \"law\" of the constitution,\r\ncomprising the four categories of elements which have been enumerated,\r\nis at all points, whether written or unwritten, enforceable by the\r\ncourts; the conventions, although they may and not seldom do relate to\r\nmatters of vital importance, are not so enforceable. The conventions\r\nconsist of understandings, practices, and habits by which are\r\nregulated a large proportion of the actual operations of the\r\ngovernmental authorities. They may have acquired expression in written\r\nform, but they do not appear in the statute-books or in any instrument\r\nwhich can be made the basis of action in a court of law. For example,\r\nit is a convention of the constitution which forbids the king to veto\r\na measure passed by the houses of Parliament. If the sovereign were in\r\nthese days actually to veto a bill, the political consequences might\r\nbe serious, but there could be no question of the sheer legality of\r\nthe deed. It is by virtue of a convention, not a law, of the\r\nconstitution, that ministers resign office when they have ceased to\r\ncommand the confidence of the House of Commons; that a bill must be\r\nread three times before being finally voted upon in the House of\r\nCommons; that Parliament is convened annually and that it consists of\r\ntwo houses. The cabinet, and all that the cabinet, as such, stands\r\nfor, rests entirely upon convention. To these things, and many others,\r\nthe student who is concerned exclusively with the constitutional law\r\nof the British nation may give little or no attention. But by one who\r\nis seeking to understand the constitutional system as it is and as it\r\noperates attention must be fixed upon the conventions quite as\r\nsteadily as upon the positive rules of law. If the conventions are not\r\nto be regarded as technically parts of the constitution, they are at\r\nleast not infrequently as binding in practice as are these rules; and\r\nthey may be even more determinative of the operations of the public\r\npowers.[49] The English constitution is indeed, as Mr. Bryce has\r\ndescribed it, \"a mass of precedents carried in men's minds or recorded\r\nin writing, dicta of lawyers or statesmen, customs, usages,        (p. 044)\r\nunderstandings and beliefs, a number of statutes mixed up with customs\r\nand all covered over with a parasitic growth of legal decisions and\r\npolitical habits.\"[50] At no time has an attempt been made to collect\r\nand to reduce to writing this stupendous mass of scattered material,\r\nand no such attempt is likely ever to be made. \"The English,\" as\r\nremarks the French critic Boutmy, \"have left the different parts of\r\ntheir constitution where the waves of history have deposited them;\r\nthey have not attempted to bring them together, to classify or\r\ncomplete them, or to make of it a consistent or coherent whole.\"[51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 48: Introduction to the Study of the Law\r\n                   of the Constitution (7th ed., London, 1908),\r\n                   22-29.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 49: Convention occupies a large place in\r\n                   most political systems, even in countries which are\r\n                   governed under elaborate written constitutions.\r\n                   Their importance in the government of the United\r\n                   States is familiar (see Bryce, American\r\n                   Commonwealth, 3d ed., I., Chaps. 34-35).

Chardon,\r\n                   L'Administration de la France; les fonctionnaires\r\n                   (Paris, 1908), 79-105.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 50: J.

THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n*44. Aspects of Continuity and of Change.*--In pursuance of what has\r\nbeen said two observations, representing opposite aspects of the same\r\ntruth, are pertinent. The first is that in respect to the principles\r\nand many of the practices of the English constitution it is\r\npre-eminently true that, to employ a familiar phrase of Bishop Stubbs,\r\nthe roots of the present lie deep in the past.[52] The second is that\r\nthe English constitution is a living organism, so constantly\r\nundergoing modification that any description of it which may be\r\nattempted is likely to be subject to correction almost before it can\r\nbe completed. At no time, as Mr. Freeman wrote, \"has the tie between\r\nthe present and the past been rent asunder; at no moment have\r\nEnglishmen sat down to put together a wholly new constitution in\r\nobedience to some dazzling theory.\"[53] On the contrary, each step in\r\nthe growth of the constitutional system has been the natural\r\nconsequence of some earlier step. Great changes, it is true, have been\r\nwrought. To mention but the most obvious illustration, autocratic\r\nkingship has been replaced by a parliamentary government based upon a\r\nthoroughgoing political democracy. None the less, transitions have\r\nbeen regularly so gradual, deference to tradition so habitual, and the\r\ndisposition to cling to ancient names and forms, even when the spirit\r\nhad changed, so deep-seated, that the constitutional history of\r\nEngland presents elements of continuity which cannot be paralleled in\r\nany other country of Europe.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 52: Constitutional History of England,\r\n                   I., prefatory note.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 53: Growth of the English Constitution,\r\n                   19.]\r\n\r\nThe letter of a written constitution may survive through many decades\r\nunchanged, as has that of the Italian _Statuto_ of 1848, and as did\r\nthat of the American constitution between 1804 and 1865. No        (p. 045)\r\nconstitutional system, however, long stands still, and least of all\r\none of the English variety, in which there exists but little of even\r\nthe formal rigidity arising from written texts. Having no fixed and\r\norderly shape assigned it originally by some supreme authority, the\r\nconstitution of the United Kingdom has retained throughout its history\r\na notably large measure of flexibility. It is by no means to-day what\r\nit was fifty years ago; fifty years hence it will be by no means what\r\nit is to-day. In times past changes have been accompanied by violence,\r\nor, at least, by extraordinary manifestations of the national will.\r\nNowadays they are introduced through the ordinary and peaceful\r\nprocesses of legislation, of judicial interpretation, and of\r\nadministrative practice. Sometimes, as in the instance of the recent\r\noverhauling of the status of the House of Lords, they are accompanied\r\nby heated controversy and widespread public agitation. Not\r\ninfrequently, however, they represent inevitable and unopposed\r\namplifications of existing law or practice and are taken note of\r\nscarcely at all by the nation at large.\r\n\r\n*45. The Constituent Powers of Parliament.*--The principal means by\r\nwhich changes are wrought in the English constitution to-day is that\r\nof parliamentary enactment. It is to be observed that in Great Britain\r\nthere is not, nor has there ever been, any attempt to draw a line of\r\ndistinction between powers that are constituent and powers that are\r\nlegislative. All are vested alike in Parliament, and in respect to the\r\nprocesses of enactment, repeal, and revision there is no difference\r\nwhatsoever between a measure affecting the fundamental principles of\r\nthe governmental system and a statute pertaining to the commonest\r\nsubject of ordinary law. \"Our Parliament,\" observes Mr. Anson, \"can\r\nmake laws protecting wild birds or shell-fish, and with the same\r\nprocedure could break the connection of Church and State, or give\r\npolitical power to two millions of citizens, and redistribute it among\r\nnew constituencies.\"[54] The keystone of the law of the constitution\r\nis, indeed, the unqualified omnipotence which Parliament possesses in\r\nthe spheres both of constitution-making and of ordinary legislation.\r\nIn Parliament is embodied the supreme will of the nation; and although\r\nfrom time to time that will may declare itself in widely varying and\r\neven inconsistent ways, at any given moment its pronouncements are\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 54: Law and Custom of the Constitution,\r\n                   4th ed., I., 358.]\r\n\r\n*46. What are \"Constitutional\" Laws?*--From this unrestricted\r\ncompetence of Parliament arise two highly important facts. One of them\r\nis that the distinction between \"constitutional\" laws, on the one\r\nhand, and ordinary statutes, on the other, is neither so obvious nor\r\nso essential as under most governmental systems. The concept,      (p. 046)\r\neven, of constitutional law has developed but slowly among the\r\nEnglish, and the phrase is as yet seldom employed in legal discussion.\r\nIn the United States constitutional amendments or addenda, in so far\r\nat least as they assume written form, emanate from sources and by\r\nprocesses different from those that obtain in the enactment of\r\nordinary statutes. In most continental nations the constituent process\r\nis at least somewhat different from that employed in the enactment of\r\nsimple laws. And these specially devised processes are designed to\r\nemphasize the essential differentiation of the product from the\r\nhandiwork of the ordinary legislative bodies. In Great Britain,\r\nhowever, there is, as has appeared, no difference of process, and the\r\ndistinction between the law of the constitution and ordinary statute\r\nlaw is not infrequently all but impossible to trace. If it is to be\r\ntraced at all, it must be derived from the circumstances of enactment.\r\nSome measures, e.g., the Habeas Corpus Act, the Act of Settlement, and\r\nthe Parliament Act of 1911, relate obviously to the most fundamental\r\nand enduring aspects of state. Others just as clearly have to do with\r\nephemeral and purely legislative concerns. Precisely where the line\r\nshould be drawn between the two no man can say. It is, in the opinion\r\nof Mr. Bryce, because of this obstacle primarily that no attempt has\r\nbeen made to reduce the English constitution to the form of a single\r\nfundamental enactment.[55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 55: Studies in History and Jurisprudence,\r\n                   I., No. 3.]\r\n\r\n*47. All Parts of the Constitution subject to Amendment.*--In the second\r\nplace, no portion whatsoever of the constitution is immune from\r\namendment or abrogation at the hand of Parliament. So forcefully was\r\nthe French observer De Tocqueville impressed with this fact that he\r\nwent so far as to assert that there really is no such thing as an\r\nEnglish constitution at all.[56] De Tocqueville wrote, however, from\r\nthe point of view of one who conceives of a constitution as of\r\nnecessity an \"instrument of special sanctity, distinct in character\r\nfrom all other laws, and alterable only by a peculiar process,\r\ndiffering to a greater or less extent from the ordinary forms of\r\nlegislation\";[57] and this conception is recognized universally\r\nnowadays to be altogether inadequate. There is, in every proper sense,\r\nan English constitution. No small portion of it, indeed, is in written\r\nform. And it is worth observing that in practice there is tending to\r\nbe established in England in our own day some measure of that      (p. 047)\r\ndistinction between constituent and legislative functions which\r\nobtains in other countries. There is no disposition to strip from\r\nParliament its constituent powers; but the feeling is gaining ground\r\nthat when fundamental and far-reaching innovations are contemplated\r\naction ought not to be taken until after there shall have been an\r\nappeal to the nation through the medium of a general election at which\r\nthe desirability of the proposed changes shall be submitted as a clear\r\nissue. The principle, broadly stated, is that Parliament ought to\r\nexercise in any important matter its constituent powers only under the\r\nsanction of direct popular mandate. It was essentially in deference to\r\nthis principle that the elections of December, 1910, turning squarely\r\nupon the issue of the reform of the House of Lords, were ordered.\r\nThus, while in numerous continental countries the distinction between\r\nconstituent and legislative functions is being nowadays somewhat\r\nrelaxed, in Great Britain there is distinctly a tendency to establish\r\nin a measure a differentiation in this matter which long has been in\r\npractice non-existent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 56: \"In England the Parliament has an\r\n                   acknowledged right to modify the constitution; as,\r\n                   therefore, the constitution may undergo perpetual\r\n                   changes, it does not in reality exist (_elle\r\n                   n'existe point_); the Parliament is at once a\r\n                   legislative and a constituent assembly.\" OEuvres\r\n                   Complètes; I., 166-167.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 57: Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   2.]\r\n\r\nIn effect, every measure of Parliament, of whatsoever nature and under\r\nwhatsoever circumstances enacted, is \"constitutional,\" in the sense\r\nthat it is legally valid and enforceable. When an Englishman asserts\r\nof a measure that it is unconstitutional he means only that it is\r\ninconsistent with a previous enactment, an established usage, the\r\nprinciples of international law, or the commonly accepted standards of\r\nmorality. Such a measure, if passed in due form by Parliament, becomes\r\nan integral part of the law of the land, and as such will be enforced\r\nby the courts. There is no means by which it may be rendered of no\r\neffect, save repeal by the same or a succeeding parliament. In\r\nEngland, as in European countries generally, the judicial tribunals\r\nare endowed with no power to pass upon the constitutional validity of\r\nlegislative acts. Every such act is _ipso facto_ valid, whether it\r\nrelates to the most trivial subject of ordinary legislation or to the\r\norganic arrangements of the state; and no person or body, aside from\r\nParliament itself, possesses a right to override it or to set it\r\naside.[58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 58: For brief discussions of the general\r\n                   nature of the English constitution see A.

THE CROWN: LEGAL STATUS AND PRIVILEGES\r\n\r\n*48. Contrasts of Theory and Fact.*--The government of the United\r\nKingdom is in ultimate theory an absolute monarchy, in form a limited,\r\nconstitutional monarchy, and in fact a thoroughgoing democracy.[59] At\r\nits head stands the sovereign, who is at the same time the supreme\r\nexecutive, a co-ordinate legislative authority (and, in theory, much\r\nmore than that), the fountain of justice and of honor, the \"supreme\r\ngovernor\" of the Church, the commander-in-chief of the army and navy,\r\nthe conservator of the peace, and the _parens patriae_ and _ex\r\nofficio_ guardian of the helpless and the needy. In law, all land is\r\nheld, directly or indirectly, of him. Parliament exists only by his\r\nwill. Those who sit in it are summoned by his writ, and the privilege\r\nof voting for a member of the lower chamber is only a franchise, not a\r\nright independent of his grant. Technically, the sovereign never dies;\r\nthere is only a demise of the crown, i.e., a transfer of regal\r\nauthority from one person to another, and the state is never without a\r\nrecognized head.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 59: From this essential incongruity of\r\n                   theory, form, and fact arises the special\r\n                   difficulty which must attend any attempt to\r\n                   describe with accuracy and completeness the British\r\n                   constitutional system. In the study of every\r\n                   government the divergences of theory and fact must\r\n                   be borne constantly in mind, but nowhere are these\r\n                   divergences so numerous, so far-reaching, or so\r\n                   fundamental as in the government of the United\r\n                   Kingdom.]\r\n\r\nThe assertions that have been made represent with substantial accuracy\r\nthe ultimate theory of the status of the crown in the governmental\r\nsystem. In respect to the form and fact of that system as it actually\r\noperates, however, it would hardly be possible to make assertions that\r\nwould convey a more erroneous impression. The breadth of the\r\ndiscrepancy that here subsists between theory and fact will be made\r\napparent as examination proceeds of the organization and workings of\r\nthe executive, the legislative, and the judicial departments of the\r\ngovernment of the realm. It is necessary first of all, however, to\r\ngive attention to certain of the more external aspects of the position\r\nwhich the monarch occupies.\r\n\r\n*49. Title to the Throne: the Act of Settlement, 1701.*--Since     (p. 049)\r\nthe Revolution of 1688 title to the English throne has been based\r\nsolely upon the will of the nation as expressed in parliamentary\r\nenactment. The statute under which the succession is regulated is the\r\nAct of Settlement, passed by the Tory parliament of 1701, by which it\r\nwas provided that, in default of heirs of William III. and Anne, the\r\ncrown and all prerogatives thereto appertaining should \"be, remain,\r\nand continue to the most Excellent Princess Sophia, and the heirs of\r\nher body, being Protestants.\"[60] Sophia, a granddaughter of James I.,\r\nwas the widow of the Elector of Hanover, and although in 1701 she was\r\nnot first in the natural order of succession she was first among the\r\nsurviving heirs who were Protestants. It was by virtue of the act\r\nmentioned that, upon the death of Anne in 1714, the throne devolved\r\nupon the son of the German Electress (George I.). The present\r\nsovereign, George V., is the eighth of the Hanoverian dynasty.\r\nAlthough it would be entirely within the competence of Parliament to\r\nrepeal the Act of Settlement and to vest the crown in a member of some\r\nhouse other than the Hanoverian, there is, of course, no occasion for\r\nsuch an act, and the throne may be expected to continue to pass from\r\none member of the present royal family to another in strict accordance\r\nwith the principles of heredity and primogeniture. The rules of\r\ndescent are essentially identical with those governing the inheritance\r\nof real property at common law.[61] Regularly, the sovereign's eldest\r\nson, the Prince of Wales,[62] inherits. If he be not alive, the\r\ninheritance passes to his issue, male or female. If there be none, the\r\nsuccession devolves upon the sovereign's second son, or upon his\r\nissue; and in default thereof, upon the eldest son who survives, or\r\nhis issue. If the vacancy be not supplied by or through, a son,\r\ndaughters and their issue inherit after a similar order. No Catholic\r\nmay inherit, nor anyone marrying a Catholic; and by the Act of 1701 it\r\nwas stipulated that every person who should attain the throne \"shall join\r\nin communion with the Church of England as by law  established.\"   (p. 050)\r\nIf after accession the sovereign should avow himself a Catholic, or\r\nshould marry a Catholic, his subjects would be absolved from their\r\nallegiance. It is required, furthermore, that the sovereign shall take\r\nat his coronation an oath wherein the tenets of Catholicism are\r\nabjured. Until 1910 the phraseology of this oath, formulated as it was\r\nin a period when ecclesiastical animosities were still fervid,[63] was\r\nsuch as to be offensive not only to Catholics but to temperate-minded\r\nmen of all faiths. By act of parliament passed in anticipation of the\r\ncoronation of George V., the language employed in the oath was made\r\nvery much less objectionable. The sovereign is required now merely to\r\ndeclare \"that he is a faithful Protestant and that he will, according\r\nto the true intent of the enactments which secure the Protestant\r\nsuccession to the throne of the Realm, uphold and maintain the said\r\nenactments to the best of his power according to law.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 60: The text of the Act of Settlement is\r\n                   printed in Stubbs, Select Charters, 528-531; Adams\r\n                   and Stephens, Select Documents, 475-479; and Gee\r\n                   and Hardy, Documents Illustrative of English Church\r\n                   History, 664-670, As safeguards against dangers\r\n                   which might conceivably arise from the accession of\r\n                   a foreign-born sovereign the Act stipulated (1)\r\n                   that no person who should thereafter come into\r\n                   possession of the crown should go outside the\r\n                   dominions of England, Scotland, or Ireland, without\r\n                   consent of Parliament, and (2) that in the event\r\n                   that the crown should devolve upon any person not a\r\n                   native of England the nation should not be obliged\r\n                   to engage in any war for the defense of any\r\n                   dominions or territories not belonging to the crown\r\n                   of England, without consent of Parliament.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 61: Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   17.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 62: This title was created by Edward I.\r\n                   in 1301. Its possession has never involved the\r\n                   exercise of any measure of political power.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 63: The words to be employed were\r\n                   prescribed originally in the Act for Establishing\r\n                   the Coronation Oath, passed in the first year of\r\n                   William and Mary.

Bailey, The\r\n                   Succession to the English Crown (London, 1879).]\r\n\r\n*50. Regencies.*--The age of majority of the sovereign is eighteen. The\r\nconstitutions of most monarchical states contain more or less\r\nelaborate stipulations respecting the establishment of a regency in\r\nthe event of the sovereign's minority or incapacitation. In Great\r\nBritain, on the contrary, the practice has been to make provision for\r\neach such contingency when it should arise. A regency can be created\r\nand a regent designated only by act of Parliament. Parliamentary\r\nenactments, however, become operative only upon receiving the assent\r\nof the crown, and it has sometimes happened that the sovereign for\r\nwhom a regent was required to be appointed was incapable of performing\r\nany governmental act. In such a case, there has been resort usually to\r\nsome legal fiction by which the appearance, at least, of regularity\r\nhas been preserved. A regency act regularly defines the limits of the\r\nregent's powers and establishes specific safeguards in respect to the\r\ninterests of both the sovereign and the nation.[64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 64: For the text of the Regency Act of\r\n                   1811, passed by reason of the incapacitation of\r\n                   George III., see Robertson, Statutes, Cases and\r\n                   Documents, 171-182. For an excellent survey of the\r\n                   general subject see May and Holland, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, I., Chap. 3.]\r\n\r\n*51. Royal Privileges: the Civil List.*--The sovereign is capable of\r\nowning land and other property, and of disposing of it precisely as\r\nmay any private citizen. The vast accumulations of property, however,\r\nwhich at one time comprised the principal source of revenue of the\r\ncrown, have become the possession of the state, and as such are\r\nadministered entirely under the direction of Parliament. In lieu   (p. 051)\r\nof the income derived formerly from land and other independent sources\r\nthe sovereign has been accorded for the support of the royal household\r\na fixed annual subsidy--voted under the designation of the Civil\r\nList--the amount of which is determined afresh at the beginning of\r\neach reign. The Civil List was instituted by an act of 1689 in which\r\nParliament settled upon the king for the meeting of personal expenses,\r\nthe payment of civil officers, and other charges, a stipulated sum,\r\nthus separating for the first time the private expenditures of the\r\ncrown from the public outlays of the nation.[65] The sum given William\r\nIII. was £700,000. George III., in return for a fixed Civil List,\r\nsurrendered his interest in the hereditary revenues of the crown, and\r\nWilliam IV. went further and, in return for a Civil List of £510,000 a\r\nyear, surrendered not only the hereditary revenues but also a large\r\ngroup of miscellaneous and casual sources of income.[66] At the\r\naccession of Queen Victoria the Civil List was fixed at £385,000. The\r\namount was comparatively small, but opportunity was taken at the time\r\nfinally to transfer to Parliament the making of provision for all\r\ncharges properly incident to the maintenance of the state. In addition\r\nto various annuities payable to the children of the royal family, the\r\nCivil List of Edward VII., established by Act of July 2, 1901,\r\namounted to £470,000, of which £110,000 was appropriated to the privy\r\npurse of the king and queen, £125,000 to salaries and retiring\r\nallowances of the royal household, and £193,000 to household expenses.\r\nAt the accession of George V., in 1910, the Civil List was continued\r\nin the sum of £470,000.[67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 65: Under Charles II. Parliament began to\r\n                   appropriate portions of the revenue for specific\r\n                   purposes, and after 1688 this became the general\r\n                   practice. Throughout a century the proceeds of\r\n                   particular taxes were appropriated for particular\r\n                   ends. But in 1787 Pitt simplified the procedure\r\n                   involved by creating a single Consolidated Fund\r\n                   into which all revenues were turned and from which\r\n                   all expenditures were met.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 66: Accuracy requires mention of the fact\r\n                   that, by exception, the crown still enjoys the\r\n                   revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of\r\n                   Cornwall, the latter being part of the appanage of\r\n                   the Prince of Wales.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 67: On the history of the Civil List see\r\n                   May and Holland, Constitutional History of England,\r\n                   I., 152-175.]\r\n\r\nThe sovereign enjoys unrestricted immunity from political\r\nresponsibility and from personal distraint. The theory of the law has\r\nlong been that the king can do no wrong, which means that for his\r\npublic acts the sovereign's ministers must bear complete responsibility\r\nand for his private conduct he may not be called to account in any\r\ncourt of law or by any legal process. He cannot be arrested, his goods\r\ncannot be distrained, and as long as a palace remains a royal\r\nresidence no sort of judicial proceeding can be executed in it.    (p. 052)\r\nStrictly, the revenues are the king's, whence it arises that the king\r\nis himself exempt from taxation, though lands purchased by the privy\r\npurse are taxed. And there are numerous minor privileges, such as the\r\nuse of special liveries and a right to the royal salute, to which the\r\nsovereign, as such, is regularly entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE POWERS OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\n*52. Sources: the Prerogative.*--Vested in the crown is, in the last\r\nanalysis, an enormous measure of authority. The sum total of powers,\r\nwhether or not actually exercised by the sovereign immediately, is of\r\ntwo-fold origin. There are powers, in the first place, which have been\r\ndefined, or conferred outright, by parliamentary enactment. Others\r\nthere are, however--more numerous and more important--which rest upon\r\nthe simple basis of custom or the Common Law. Those powers which\r\nbelong to the statutory group are, as a rule, specific and easily\r\nascertainable. But those which comprise the ancient customary rights\r\nof the crown, i.e., the prerogative, are not always possible of exact\r\ndelimitation. The prerogative is defined by Dicey as \"the residue of\r\ndiscretionary or arbitrary authority which at any time is legally left\r\nin the hands of the crown.\"[68] The elements of it are to be\r\nascertained, not from statutes but from precedents, and the sources of\r\nit, as enumerated by Anson, are (1) the residue of the executive power\r\nwhich the king in the early stages of English history possessed in all\r\nof the branches of government; (2) survivals of the power once\r\naccruing to the king as the feudal chief of the country; and (3)\r\nattributes with which the crown has been invested by legal theory, e.g.,\r\nthe attribute of perpetuity popularly expressed in the aphorism\r\n\"the king never dies,\" and that of perfection of judgment, similarly\r\nexpressed in the saying \"the king can do no wrong.\"[69] The most\r\nconsiderable element in the prerogative is that which Anson first\r\nmentions, i.e., the power which the king has carried over, in the\r\nteeth of the popularization of the governmental system, from days when\r\nthe royal authority was not hedged about as since the seventeenth\r\ncentury it has been. It is further to be observed that no\r\ninconsiderable portion of the royal powers as they exist to-day\r\nrepresent original prerogative worked over and delimited by\r\nparliamentary enactment, so that in many instances it becomes\r\ndifficult to determine whether a given power exists by virtue of a\r\nstatute, by which it is to be regarded as absolutely defined, or   (p. 053)\r\nby virtue of an anterior prerogative which may be capable of being\r\nstretched or interpreted more or less arbitrarily. Nominally, the\r\nsovereign still holds by divine right. At the head of every public\r\nwrit to-day stand the words \"George V., by the Grace of God of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland King.\" But no principle of the working\r\nconstitution is more clearly established than that in accordance with\r\nwhich the prerogatives of the crown may be defined, restricted, or\r\nextended by the supreme legislative power. Among prerogatives once\r\nclaimed and exercised, but long since rendered obsolete by prohibitive\r\nlegislation may be mentioned those of imposing taxes without\r\nparliamentary consent, suspending or dispensing with laws, erecting\r\ntribunals not proceeding according to the ordinary course of justice,\r\ndeclaring forfeit the property of convicted traitors,[70] purveyance,\r\npre-emption, and the alienation of crown lands at pleasure.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 68: Law of the Constitution (7th ed.),\r\n                   420.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 69: Law and Custom of the Constitution,\r\n                   II., Pt. I., 3-5.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 70: Abolished by the Felony Act of 1870.]\r\n\r\n*53. Powers, Theoretical and Actual.*--It is not, however, the origin of\r\nthe royal power, but rather the manner of its exercise, that fixes the\r\nessential character of monarchy in Great Britain to-day. The student\r\nof this phase of the subject is confronted at the outset with a\r\nparadox which has found convenient expression in the aphorism that the\r\nking reigns but does not govern. The meaning of the aphorism is that,\r\nwhile the sovereign is possessed of all of the inherent dignity of\r\nroyalty, it is left to him actually to exercise in but a very\r\nrestricted measure the powers which are involved in the business of\r\ngovernment. Technically, all laws are made by the crown in parliament;\r\nall judicial decisions are rendered by the crown through the courts;\r\nall laws are executed and all administrative acts are performed by the\r\ncrown. But in point of fact laws are enacted by Parliament\r\nindependently; verdicts are brought in by tribunals whose immunity\r\nfrom royal domination is thoroughly assured; and the executive\r\nfunctions of the state are exercised all but exclusively by the\r\nministers and their subordinates. One who would understand what\r\nEnglish monarchy really is must take account continually both of what\r\nthe king does and may do theoretically and of what he does and may do\r\nin actual practice. The matter is complicated further by the fact that\r\npowers once possessed have been lost, that others which have never\r\nbeen formally relinquished have so long lain unused that the question\r\nmay fairly be debated whether they still exist, and that there never\r\nhas been, nor is likely ever to be, an attempt to enumerate\r\ncategorically or to define comprehensively the range of powers, either\r\ntheoretical or actual.\r\n\r\n*54. Executive Powers.*--Disregarding for the moment the means of their\r\nactual exercise, the powers of the crown to-day may be said to     (p. 054)\r\nfall into two principal groups. The first comprises those which are\r\nessentially executive in character; the second, those which are shared\r\nwith the two houses of Parliament, being, therefore chiefly legislative.\r\nThe first group is distinctly the more important. It includes: (1) the\r\nappointment, directly or indirectly, of all national public officers,\r\nexcept some of the officials of the parliamentary chambers and a few\r\nunimportant hereditary dignitaries; (2) the removal, upon occasion, of\r\nall appointed officers except judges, members of the Council of India,\r\nand the Comptroller and Auditor General; (3) the execution of all laws\r\nand the supervision of the executive machinery of the state throughout\r\nall its branches; (4) the expenditure of public money in accordance\r\nwith appropriations voted by Parliament; (5) the pardoning of\r\noffenders against the criminal law, with some exceptions, either\r\nbefore or after conviction;[71] (6) the granting, in so far as not\r\nprohibited by statute, of charters of incorporation; (7) the creating\r\nof all peers and the conferring of all titles and honors; (8) the\r\ncoining of all money; (9) the summoning of Convocation and, by reason\r\nof the headship of the Established Church, the virtual appointment of\r\nthe archbishops, bishops, and most of the deans and canons; (10) the\r\nsupreme command of the army and navy, involving the raising and\r\ncontrol of the armed forces of the nation, subject to such conditions\r\nonly as Parliament may impose; (11) the representing of the nation in\r\nall of its dealings with foreign powers, including the appointment of\r\nall diplomatic and consular agents and the negotiation and conclusion\r\nof peace; and (12) the exercise, largely under statutory authority\r\nconferred within the past half-century, of supervision or control in\r\nrespect to local government, education, public health, pauperism,\r\nhousing, and a wide variety of other social and industrial interests.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 71: This power, in practice, is seldom\r\n                   exercised. The Act of Settlement prescribed that\r\n                   \"no pardon shall be pleadable to an impeachment by\r\n                   the Commons in parliament.\"]\r\n\r\n*55. The Composition of the Executive.*--The executive branch of the\r\ngovernment, through whose agency these powers are exercised, consists\r\nof the sovereign, the ministry, and the entire hierarchy of\r\nadministrative officials reaching downwards from the heads of\r\ndepartments and the under-secretaries at London through the several\r\ngrades of clerks to the least important revenue and postal employees.\r\nThere are various points of view from which the chief of the executive\r\nmay be conceived of as the sovereign, the prime minister, the ministry\r\ncollectively, or the king and ministry conjointly. So far as executive\r\nfunctions go, the sovereign, in law, is very nearly as supreme as  (p. 055)\r\nin the days of personal and absolute monarchy. The ministers are but\r\nhis advisers, the local administrative authorities his agents. The\r\ngovernment is conducted wholly in his name. In practice, however,\r\nsupreme executive acts of the kinds that have been mentioned are\r\nperformed by the ministers; or, if performed by the crown immediately,\r\nwill not be undertaken without the ministers' knowledge and assent.\r\nThe ministers, and not the sovereign, may be held to account by\r\nparliament for every executive act performed, and it is but logical\r\nthat they should control the time and tenor of such acts. It falls\r\nvery generally to the prime minister to speak for and otherwise\r\nrepresent the ministerial group. On the whole, however, it accords\r\nbest with both law and fact to consider the executive under the\r\nworking constitution as consisting of the crown as represented and\r\nadvised by the ministry.\r\n\r\n*56. The Crown and Legislation.*--The second general group of powers\r\nlodged in the crown comprises those which relate to legislation.\r\nTechnically, all legislative authority is vested in \"the king in\r\nparliament,\" by which is meant the king acting in collaboration with\r\nthe two houses. Parliament transacts business only during the pleasure\r\nof the crown. The crown summons and prorogues the houses, and it is\r\nempowered at any time to dissolve the House of Commons. No\r\nparliamentary act, furthermore, is valid without the crown's assent.\r\nIt is on the legislative, rather than the executive side, none the\r\nless, that the crown has lost most heavily in actual authority. There\r\nwas a time when the crown possessed inherent law-making power and\r\nthrough the agency of proclamations and ordinances contributed\r\nindependently to the body of enforceable law. To-day the sovereign may\r\nexercise no such power, save alone in the crown colonies. It is true\r\nthat ordinances with the force of law are still issued, and that their\r\nnumber and importance tend steadily to be increased. But in all cases\r\nthese ordinances have been, and must be, authorized specifically by\r\nstatute. As \"statutory orders\" they emanate from a delegated authority\r\npurely and bear no relation to the ancient ordinance by prerogative.\r\nThe king may not even, by virtue of any inherent power, promulgate\r\nordinances in completion of parliamentary statutes--the sort of thing\r\nwhich the French president, the Italian king, and virtually every\r\ncontinental ruler may do with full propriety. Of his own authority,\r\nfurthermore, the sovereign may not alter by one jot or tittle the law\r\nof the land. There was a time when the crown claimed and exercised the\r\nright to suspend, or to dispense with, laws which had been duly enacted\r\nand put in operation. But this practice was forbidden definitely   (p. 056)\r\nin the Bill of Rights, and no sovereign since the last Stuart has\r\nsought to revive the prerogative. Still another aspect of the ancient\r\nparticipation by the king in the legislative function was the\r\ninfluencing of the composition of the House of Commons through the\r\nright to confer upon boroughs the privilege of electing members. This\r\nright, never expressly withdrawn, is regarded now as having been\r\nforfeited by disuse. Finally, the power to withhold assent from a\r\nmeasure passed in Parliament has not been exercised since the days of\r\nQueen Anne,[72] and while legally it still exists, it is conceded for\r\nall practical purposes to have been extinguished.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 72: In 1707, when the Queen refused her\r\n                   assent to a bill for settling the militia in\r\n                   Scotland.]\r\n\r\n*57. Principles Governing the Actual Exercise of Powers.*--After full\r\nallowances have been made, the powers of the British crown to-day\r\ncomprise a sum total of striking magnitude. \"All told,\" says Lowell,\r\n\"the executive authority of the crown is, in the eye of the law, very\r\nwide, far wider than that of the chief magistrate in many countries,\r\nand well-nigh as extensive as that now possessed by the monarch in any\r\ngovernment not an absolute despotism; and although the crown has no\r\ninherent legislative power except in conjunction with Parliament, it\r\nhas been given by statute very large powers of subordinate\r\nlegislation.... Since the accession of the House of Hanover the new\r\npowers conferred upon the crown by statute have probably more than\r\nmade up for the loss to the prerogative of powers which have either\r\nbeen restricted by the same process or become obsolete by disuse. By\r\nfar the greater part of the prerogative, as it existed at that time,\r\nhas remained legally vested in the crown, and can be exercised\r\nto-day.\"[73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 73: Government of England, I., 23, 26.]\r\n\r\nThe next fundamental thing to be observed is that the extended powers\r\nhere referred to are exercised, not by the king in person, but by\r\nministers with whose choosing the sovereign has but little to do and\r\nover whose acts he has only an incidental and extra-legal control.\r\nUnderlying the entire constitutional order are two principles whose\r\noperation would seem to reduce the sovereign to a sheer nonentity. The\r\nfirst is that the crown shall perform no important governmental act\r\nwhatsoever save through the agency of the ministers. The second is\r\nthat these ministers shall be responsible absolutely to Parliament for\r\nevery public act which they perform. From these principles arises the\r\nfiction that \"the king can do no wrong,\" which means legally that the\r\nsovereign cannot be adjudged guilty of wrongdoing (and that therefore\r\nno proceedings may be instituted against him), and politically that\r\nthe ministers are responsible, singly in small affairs and         (p. 057)\r\nconjointly in more weighty ones, for everything that is done in the\r\ncrown's name. \"In a constitutional point of view,\" writes an English\r\nauthority, \"so universal is the operation of this rule that there is\r\nnot a moment in the king's life, from his accession to his demise,\r\nduring which there is not some one responsible to Parliament for his\r\npublic conduct; and there can be no exercise of the crown's authority\r\nfor which it must not find some minister willing to make himself\r\nresponsible.\"[74] In continental countries the responsibility of\r\nministers is established very commonly by specific and written\r\nconstitutional provision. In Great Britain it exists by virtue simply\r\nof a group of unwritten principles, or conventions, of the\r\nconstitution; but it is there none the less real. In the conduct of\r\npublic affairs the ministry must conform to the will of the majority\r\nin the House of Commons; otherwise the wheels of government would be\r\nblocked. And from this it follows that the crown is obliged to accept,\r\nwith such grace as may be, the measures which the ministry, working\r\nwith the parliamentary majority, formulates and for which it stands\r\nready to shoulder responsibility. It is open to the king, of course,\r\nto dissuade the ministers from a given course of action. But if they\r\ncannot be turned back, and if they have the support of a parliamentary\r\nmajority, there is nothing that the sovereign can do save acquiesce.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 74: Todd, Parliamentary Government in\r\n                   England, I., 81.]\r\n\r\n*58. Appointment of Ministers.*--In the naming of a new premier,\r\nfollowing the retirement of a ministry, the king is legally\r\nunhampered; but here again in practice he is bound to designate the\r\nrecognized leader of the dominant party, and so to pursue a course in\r\nwhich there is left no room for the exercise of discretion. Only when\r\nthere is no clearly recognized leader, or when circumstances compel\r\nthe formation of a coalition ministry, is there a real opportunity for\r\nthe sovereign to choose a premier from a number of more or less\r\navailable men.[75] In the appointment of the remaining ministers, and\r\nof all persons whose offices are regarded as political, the crown\r\nyields uniformly to the judgment of the premier. The King's Speech, on\r\nthe opening of Parliament, is written by the ministers; all public\r\ncommunications of the crown pass through their hands; peers are\r\ncreated and honors bestowed in accord with their advice; measures are\r\nframed and executive acts are undertaken by them, sometimes without\r\nthe sovereign's knowledge and occasionally even contrary to his\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 75: This sort of situation presented\r\n                   itself several times during the reign of Queen\r\n                   Victoria, but in general it is exceptional.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE IMPORTANCE AND STRENGTH OF THE MONARCH                    (p. 058)\r\n\r\n*59. The Real Authority and Service of the Crown.*--It would be an\r\nerror, however, to conclude that kingship in England is unimportant,\r\nor even that the power wielded in person by the crown is negligible.\r\nOn the contrary, the uses served by the crown are indisputable and the\r\ninfluence exerted upon the course of public affairs may be decisive.\r\nThe sovereign, in the words of Bagehot, has three rights--the right to\r\nbe consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. \"A king\r\nof great sense and sagacity,\" it is added, \"would want no others.\"[76]\r\nDespite the fact that during upwards of two hundred years the\r\nsovereign has not attended the meetings of the cabinet, and so is\r\ndeprived of the opportunity of wielding influence directly upon the\r\ndeliberations of the ministers as a body, the king keeps in close\r\ntouch with the premier, and cabinet councils at which important lines\r\nof policy are to be formulated are preceded not infrequently by a\r\nconference in which the subject in hand is threshed out more or less\r\ncompletely by king and chief minister. Merely because the ancient\r\nrelation has been reversed, so that now it is the king who advises and\r\nthe ministry that arrives at decisions, it does not follow that the\r\nadvisory function is an unimportant thing. Queen Victoria many times\r\nwielded influence of a decisive nature upon the public measures of her\r\nreign, especially in respect to the conduct of foreign relations. The\r\nextent of such influence cannot be made a matter of record, because\r\nthe ministers are in effect bound not to publish the fact that a\r\ndecision upon a matter of state has been taken at the sovereign's\r\ninstance. It is familiarly known, however--to cite a recent\r\nillustration--that Edward VII. approved and encouraged the Haldane\r\narmy reforms, that he sought to dissuade the House of Lords from the\r\nrejection of the Lloyd-George budget of 1909, and that he discouraged\r\nthe raising, in any form, of the issue of the reconstitution of the\r\nupper chamber. In other words while, as a constitutional monarch\r\ncontent to remain in the background of political controversy, the late\r\nking not only had opinions but did not hesitate to make them known;\r\nand in the shaping and execution of the Liberal programme his advice\r\nwas at times a factor of importance.[77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 76: The English Constitution (rev. ed.),\r\n                   143.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 77: The most satisfactory estimate of the\r\n                   political and governmental activities of Edward\r\n                   VII. is contained in Mr. Sidney Lee's memoir of the\r\n                   king, printed in the Dictionary of National\r\n                   Biography, Second Supplement (London and New York,\r\n                   1912), I., 546-610.]\r\n\r\n*60. Why Monarchy Survives.*--Monarchy in Great Britain is a solid (p. 059)\r\nand, so far as can be foreseen, a lasting reality. Throughout the\r\ntempestuous years 1909-1911, when the nation was aroused as it had not\r\nbeen in generations upon the issue of constitutional reform, and when\r\nevery sort of project was being warmly advocated and as warmly\r\nopposed, without exception every suggested programme took for granted\r\nthe perpetuation of the monarchy as an integral part of the\r\ngovernmental system. In the general bombardment to which the\r\nhereditary House of Lords was subjected hereditary kingship wholly\r\nescaped. The reasons are numerous and complex. They arise in part,\r\nthough by no means so largely as is sometimes imagined, from the fact\r\nthat monarchy in England is a venerable institution and the innate\r\nconservatism of the Englishman, while permitting him from time to time\r\nto regulate and modify it, restrains him from doing anything so\r\nrevolutionary as to abolish it. That upon certain conspicuous\r\noccasions, as in the Cromwellian period, and again in 1688, kingship\r\nhas owed its very life to the conservative instinct of the English\r\npeople is well enough known to every student of history. But to-day,\r\nas ever, the institution rests upon a basis very much more substantial\r\nthan a mere national predilection. Monarchy remains impregnably\r\nentrenched because the crown, in addition to comprising an accustomed\r\nfeature of the governmental economy, fulfills specific ends which are\r\nrecognized universally to be eminently worth while, if not\r\nindispensable. As a social, moral, and ceremonial agency, and as a\r\nvisible symbol of the unity of the nation; king and court occupy an\r\nimmeasurable place in the life and thought of the people; and even\r\nwithin the domain of government, to employ the figure of Lowell, if\r\nthe crown is no longer the motive power of the ship of state, it is\r\nthe spar on which the sail is bent, and as such it is not only a\r\nuseful but an essential part of the vessel.[78] The entire\r\ngovernmental order of Great Britain hinges upon the parliamentary\r\nsystem, and nowhere has that system been reduced to satisfactory\r\noperation without the presence of some central, but essentially\r\ndetached, figure, whether a king or, as in France, a president with\r\nthe attributes of kingship. It is fundamentally because the English\r\npeople have discerned that kingship is not necessarily incompatible\r\nwith popular government that the monarchy has persisted. If royalty\r\nhad been felt to stand inevitably in the path of democratic progress,\r\nit is inconceivable that all the forces of tradition could have pulled\r\nit through the past seventy-five or eighty years. As it is, while half\r\na century ago there was in the country a small republican group which\r\nwas fond of urging that the monarchy was but a source of needless  (p. 060)\r\nexpense, to-day there is hardly a vestige, in any grade of society, of\r\nanti-monarchical sentiment.[79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 78: Government of England, I., 49.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 79: The best brief discussions of the\r\n                   position of the crown in the governmental system\r\n                   are Lowell, Government of England, I., Chap, 1;\r\n                   Moran, English Government, Chaps. 2-3; Marriott,\r\n                   English Political Institutions, Chap. 3; Macy,\r\n                   English Constitution, Chap. 5; and Low, Governance\r\n                   of England, Chaps. 14-15.

PRIVY COUNCIL, MINISTRY, AND CABINET\r\n\r\n*61. The Privy Council.*--One who would understand the modes by which\r\nthe powers of the crown are in practice exercised must begin by fixing\r\nfirmly in mind the nature and relations of three distinct but closely\r\ninterrelated institutions, the Privy Council, the ministry, and the\r\ncabinet. As has appeared, the Privy Council through a long period of\r\nEnglish history comprised the body of men who advised the crown and\r\nassisted to some extent in the supervision of administration. The\r\nnumber of councillors from time to time varied widely, but it tended\r\nconstantly to be too large to admit of the requisite despatch and\r\nsecrecy, and by reason principally of this consideration the crown\r\nfell into the custom of selecting as advisers a group of persons less\r\nnumerous, and perhaps more trustworthy, than the whole body of public\r\nfunctionaries collectively designated as the Privy Council. Thus arose\r\nthe cabinet, which throughout its entire history has been only an\r\ninner circle, unknown to the law, of the older and larger body. The\r\nPrivy Council survives to-day, and in both law and theory it still is\r\nthe advisory body of the crown. A cabinet member possesses authority\r\nand is known to the law only as a privy councillor. In point of fact,\r\nhowever, the Privy Council, once highly influential in affairs of\r\nstate, is now, as such, all but powerless. Such portions of the\r\ndignity of its ancient place in the constitution as remain to it are\r\nof a purely formal and ceremonial nature. It holds no meetings of a\r\ndeliberative character, and although legally its action is still\r\nessential to many public measures, as the preparation of proclamations\r\nand of orders in council, this action may be taken by as few as three\r\npersons.[80] All cabinet members are members of the Council, so that\r\neven one-fifth or one-sixth of the cabinet group is competent to meet\r\nevery legal requirement imposed upon the Council as a whole.[81]   (p. 061)\r\nAll councillors are appointed by the crown and continue in office for\r\nlife or until dismissed. Their number is unlimited, and the only\r\nqualification necessary for appointment is British nativity. Members\r\nfall into three groups: (1) members of the cabinet; (2) holders of\r\ncertain important non-political offices who by custom are entitled to\r\nappointment; (3) persons eminent in politics, literature, law, or\r\nscience, or by reason of service rendered the crown, upon whom the\r\ndignity is conferred as an honorary distinction. Members bear\r\nregularly the title of Right Honorable. The President of the Council,\r\ndesignated by the crown, takes rank in the House of Lords next after\r\nthe Chancellor and Treasurer.[82]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 80: On the nature of orders in council\r\n                   see Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, II.,\r\n                   Pt. 1, 147-149.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 81: It is to be observed, however, that\r\n                   despite the transfer of the business devolving\r\n                   formerly upon the Council into the hands of the\r\n                   specially constituted departments of government,\r\n                   the Council does still, through the agency of its\r\n                   committees, perform a modicum of actual service. Of\r\n                   principal importance among the committees is the\r\n                   Judicial Committee, which hears appeals in\r\n                   ecclesiastical cases and renders final verdict in\r\n                   all appeals coming from tribunals outside the\r\n                   United Kingdom. See p. 175.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 82: Traill, Central Government, Chap.\r\n                   12.]\r\n\r\n*62. Ministry and Cabinet.*--Another governmental group which, like the\r\nPrivy Council, differs from the cabinet while containing it, is the\r\nministry. The ministry comprises a large and variable body of\r\nfunctionaries, some of whom occupy the principal offices of state and\r\ndivide their efforts between advising the crown, i.e., formulating\r\ngovernmental policy, and administering the affairs of their respective\r\ndepartments, and others of whom, occupying less important executive\r\npositions, do not possess, save indirectly, the advisory function. The\r\nfirst group comprises, approximately at least, the cabinet. Most heads\r\nof departments are regularly and necessarily in the cabinet. A few are\r\nin it as a rule, though not invariably. A few, still less important,\r\nmay be, but are not likely to be, admitted to it. And, finally, a\r\nlarge number of parliamentary under-secretaries, party \"whips,\" and\r\nofficers of the royal household are certain not to be admitted.[83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 83: On the relations of cabinet and\r\n                   ministry see Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   Chap. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS\r\n\r\nIn respect to both origin and legal status the executive departments\r\nof the central government of Great Britain exhibit little of the\r\nconformity to type which characterizes their counterparts in the\r\nlogical and self-consistent governmental systems of the majority of\r\ncontinental countries. Under the pressure, however, of custom and  (p. 062)\r\nof parliamentary control, they have been reduced to essentially a\r\ncommon style of organization and a common mode of administrative\r\nprocedure. In virtually every instance the department is presided over\r\nby a single responsible minister, assisted as a rule by one or more\r\nparliamentary under-secretaries and, more remotely, by a greater or\r\nlesser body of non-political officials who carry on the actual work of\r\nthe department and whose tenure is not affected by the political\r\nfortunes of their chiefs.\r\n\r\n*63. The Treasury.*--Among the numerous departments, some represent\r\nsurvivals of great offices of state of an earlier period, some are\r\noffshoots of the ancient secretariat, and some comprise boards and\r\ncommissions established in days comparatively recent. In the first\r\ngroup fall the offices of the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord High\r\nChancellor, and the Lord High Admiral. From the early sixteenth\r\ncentury to the death of Queen Anne the principal official of the\r\nTreasury was the Lord High Treasurer. Since 1714, however, the office\r\nhas been regularly in commission. The duties connected with it have\r\nbeen intrusted to a board composed of certain Lords of the Treasury,\r\nand no individual to-day bears the Lord High Treasurer's title. When a\r\nministry is made up the group of Treasury Lords is renewed, and as a\r\nrule the post of First Lord is assumed by the premier. In point of\r\nfact, however, the board is never called together, some of its members\r\nhave no actual connection whatsoever with the Treasury, and the\r\nfunctions of this most important of all departments are in practice\r\nexercised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, assisted by the Junior\r\nLords and the under-secretaries. The Exchequer, i.e., the department\r\nconcerned principally with the collection of the taxes, is in fact,\r\nthough not in name, a branch of the Treasury Board. Within the\r\nTreasury, and immediately under the direction of the Chancellor, is\r\ndrawn up the annual budget, embodying a statement of the contemplated\r\nexpenditures of the year and a programme of taxation calculated to\r\nproduce the requisite revenue. The Treasury exercises general control\r\nover all other departments of the public service, e.g., the\r\nPost-office and the Board of Customs, in which public money is\r\ncollected or expended.[84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 84: On the organization and workings of\r\n                   the Treasury see Lowell, Government of England, I,\r\n                   Chap. 5; Dicey, Law of the Constitution, Chap. 10;\r\n                   Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, II., Pt.\r\n                   1, 173-190; Traill, Central Government, Chap. 3.]\r\n\r\n*64. The Admiralty Board and the Lord High Chancellorship.*--A second of\r\nthe ancient offices of state which survives only in commission is  (p. 063)\r\nthat of the Lord High Admiral. The functions of this important post\r\ndevolve to-day upon an Admiralty Board, consisting strictly of a First\r\nLord, four Naval Lords (naval experts, usually of high rank), and a\r\nCivil Lord, with whom, however, sit a number of parliamentary and\r\npermanent secretaries. The First Lord is invariably a member of the\r\ncabinet, and while legally the status of the six Lords is identical,\r\nin practice the position of the First Lord approximates closely that\r\nof the minister of marine in continental countries. Unlike the\r\nTreasury Lords, the Lords of the Admiralty actually meet, and transact\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe third of the executive offices which comprise survivals from early\r\ntimes is that of the Lord High Chancellor. There is in Great Britain\r\nno single official who fills even approximately the position occupied\r\nelsewhere by a minister of justice or an attorney-general, but the\r\nmost important of several officers who supply the lack is the Lord\r\nChancellor. \"The greatest dignitary,\" says Lowell, \"in the British\r\ngovernment, the one endowed by law with the most exalted and most\r\ndiverse functions, the only great officer of state who has retained\r\nhis ancient rights, the man who defies the doctrine of the separation\r\nof powers more than any other personage on earth, is the Lord\r\nChancellor.\"[85] The Lord Chancellor is invariably a member of the\r\nCabinet. He is the chief judge in the High Court of Justice and in the\r\nCourt of Appeal. He appoints and removes the justices of the peace and\r\nthe judges of the county courts and wields large influence in\r\nappointments to higher judicial posts. He affixes the Great Seal where\r\nit is required to give validity to the acts of the crown and he\r\nperforms a wide variety of other more or less formal services.\r\nFinally, it is the Lord High Chancellor who presides in the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 85: Government of England, I., 131.]\r\n\r\n*65. The Five Secretaries of State.*--Five of the great departments\r\nto-day represent the product of a curious evolution of the ancient\r\nsecretariat of state. Originally there was but a single official who\r\nbore the designation of secretary of state. In the earlier eighteenth\r\ncentury a second official was added, although no new office was\r\ncreated. At the close of the century a third was added, after the\r\nCrimean War a fourth, and after the Indian Mutiny of 1857 a fifth.\r\nThere are now, accordingly, five \"principal secretaries of state,\" all\r\nin theory occupying the same office and each, save for a few statutory\r\nrestrictions, competent legally to exercise the functions of any or\r\nall of the others. In practice each of the five holds strictly to his\r\nown domain. The group comprises: (1) the Secretary of State for the\r\nHome Department, assisted by a parliamentary under-secretary and a\r\nlarge staff of permanent officials, and possessing functions of a\r\nhighly miscellaneous sort--those, in general, belonging to the     (p. 064)\r\nancient secretariat which have not been assigned to the care of other\r\ndepartments; (2) the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at the\r\nhead of a department which not only conducts foreign relations but\r\nadministers the affairs of such protectorates as are not closely\r\nconnected with any of the colonies; (3) the Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies; (4) the Secretary of State for War; and (5) the Secretary of\r\nState for India, assisted by a special India Council of ten to\r\nfourteen members.\r\n\r\n*66. The Administrative Boards.*--The third general group of departments\r\ncomprises those which have arisen through the establishment in\r\ncomparatively recent years of a variety of administrative boards\r\nor commissions. Two--the Board of Trade and the Board of\r\nEducation--originated as committees of the Privy Council. Three\r\nothers--the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Works, and the Local\r\nGovernment Board--represent the development of administrative\r\ncommissions not conceived of originally as vested with political\r\ncharacter. All are in effect independent and co-ordinate governmental\r\ndepartments. The composition and functions of the Board of Trade are\r\nregulated by order in council at the opening of each reign, but the\r\ncharacter of the other four is determined wholly by statute. At the\r\nhead of each is a president (save that the chief of the Board of Works\r\nis known as First Commissioner), and the membership embraces the five\r\nsecretaries of state and a variable number of other important\r\ndignitaries. This membership, however, is but nominal. No one of the\r\nBoards actually meets, and the work of each is performed entirely by\r\nits president, with, in some instances, the assistance of a\r\nparliamentary under-secretary. \"In practice, therefore, these boards\r\nare legal phantoms that provide imaginary colleagues for a single\r\nresponsible minister.\"[86] Very commonly the presidents are admitted\r\nto the cabinet, but sometimes they are not.[87]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 86: Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   84.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 87: On the organization and workings of\r\n                   the executive departments see Lowell, _op. cit._,\r\n                   I., Chaps. 4-6; Marriott, English Political\r\n                   Institutions, Chap. 5; Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, II., Pt. 1, Chap. 3; Traill, Central\r\n                   Government, Chaps. 3-11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CABINET: COMPOSITION AND CHARACTER\r\n\r\n*67. Regular and Occasional Members.*--The cabinet comprises a variable\r\ngroup of the principal ministers of state upon whom devolves singly\r\nthe task of administering the affairs of their respective departments\r\nand, collectively, that of shaping the policy and directing the conduct\r\nof the government as a whole. The position occupied by the cabinet (p. 065)\r\nin the constitutional system is anomalous, but transcendently\r\nimportant. As has been pointed out, the cabinet as such is unknown to\r\nEnglish law. Legally, the cabinet member derives his administrative\r\nfunction from the fact of his appointment to a ministerial post, and\r\nhis advisory function from his membership in the Privy Council. The\r\ncabinet exists as an informal, extra-legal ministerial group into\r\nwhose hands, through prolonged historical development, has fallen the\r\nsupreme direction of both the executive and the legislative activities\r\nof the state. The composition of the body is determined largely by\r\ncustom, but in part by passing circumstance. Certain ministerial heads\r\nare invariably included: the First Lord of the Treasury, the Lord\r\nChancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the five Secretaries of\r\nState, and the First Lord of the Admiralty. Two dignitaries who\r\npossess no administrative function, i.e., the Lord President of the\r\nPrivy Council and the Lord Privy Seal,[88] are likewise always\r\nincluded. Beyond this, the make-up of the cabinet group is left to the\r\ndiscretion of the premier. The importance of a given office at the\r\nmoment and the wishes of the appointee, together with general\r\nconsiderations of party expediency, may well enter into a decision\r\nrelative to the seating of individual departmental heads. In recent\r\nyears the presidents of the Board of Trade, the Board of Education,\r\nand the Local Government Board have regularly been included, together\r\nwith the Lord Lieutenant or the Chief Secretary for Ireland.[89] The\r\nSecretary for Scotland and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\r\nare usually included; the Postmaster-General and the President of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture frequently, and the First Commissioner of Works\r\nand the Lord Chancellor for Ireland occasionally.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 88: The functions of this official are\r\n                   but nominal. In 1870 Sir Charles Dilke moved to\r\n                   abolish the office as useless, but Gladstone urged\r\n                   the desirability of having in the cabinet at least\r\n                   one man who should not be burdened with the\r\n                   management of a department, and the motion was\r\n                   lost. The presidency of the Council is a post\r\n                   likewise of dignity but of meager governmental\r\n                   power or responsibility.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 89: In theory the powers of the executive\r\n                   are exercised in Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant,\r\n                   but in practice they devolve almost entirely upon\r\n                   the nominally inferior official, the Chief\r\n                   Secretary.]\r\n\r\n*68. Increasing Size.*--The trend is distinctly in the direction of an\r\nincrease in the size of the body. The more notable cabinets of the\r\neighteenth century contained, as a rule, not above seven to ten\r\nmembers. In the first half of the nineteenth century the number ran up\r\nto thirteen or fourteen, and throughout the Gladstone-Disraeli period\r\nit seldom fell below this level. The second Salisbury cabinet, at its\r\nfall in 1892, numbered seventeen, and when, following the elections of\r\n1900, the third Salisbury government was reconstructed, the cabinet\r\nattained a membership of twenty.[90] The Balfour cabinet of 1905   (p. 066)\r\nand the succeeding Campbell-Bannerman cabinet likewise numbered\r\ntwenty. The increase is attributable to several causes, especially the\r\npressure which comes from ambitious statesmen for admission to the\r\ninfluential circle, the growing necessity of according representation\r\nto varied elements and interests within the dominant party, the\r\nmultiplication of state activities which call for direction under new\r\nand important departments, and the disposition to accord to every\r\nconsiderable branch of the administrative system at least one\r\nrepresentative. The effect is to produce a certain unwieldiness, to\r\navoid which, it will be recalled, the cabinet was originally\r\ninstituted. Only through the domination of the cabinet by a few of its\r\nmost influential members can expeditiousness be preserved, and during\r\nrecent years there has been a tendency toward the differentiation of\r\nan inner circle which shall bear to the whole cabinet a relation\r\nsomewhat analogous to that which the cabinet now bears to the\r\nministry. Development in this direction is viewed apprehensively by\r\nmany people who regard that the concentration of power in the hands of\r\nan \"inner cabinet\" might well fail to be accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding concentration of recognized responsibility. During more\r\nthan a decade criticism of the inordinate size of the cabinet group\r\nhas been voiced freely upon numerous occasions and by many\r\nobservers.[91]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 90: Lord Salisbury at this point retired\r\n                   from the Foreign Office, which was assigned to Lord\r\n                   Lansdowne, and assumed in conjunction with the\r\n                   premiership the less exacting post of Lord Privy\r\n                   Seal.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 91: Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   59; Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, II.,\r\n                   Pt. 1, 211.]\r\n\r\n*69. Appointment of the Premier.*--When a new cabinet is to be made up\r\nthe first step is the designation of the prime minister. Legally the\r\nchoice rests with the crown, but considerations of practical politics\r\nleave, as a rule, no room whatsoever for the exercise of discretion.\r\nThe crown sends as a matter of course for the statesman who is able to\r\ncommand the support of the majority in the House of Commons. If the\r\nretiring ministry has \"fallen,\" i.e., has lost its parliamentary\r\nmajority, the new premier is certain to be the recognized leader of\r\nthe party which formerly has played the rôle of opposition. If there\r\nhas not occurred a shift in party status, the premiership will be\r\nbestowed upon some one of the colleagues, at least upon one of the\r\nfellow-partisans, of the retiring premier, nominated, if need be, by\r\nthe chiefs of the party. Thus, when in 1894 Gladstone retired from\r\noffice by reason of physical infirmity, the Liberal leaders in the two\r\nhouses conferred upon the question as to whether he should be succeeded\r\nby Sir William Vernon-Harcourt or by Lord Rosebery. They           (p. 067)\r\nrecommended Lord Rosebery, who was forthwith appointed by the Queen.\r\nIf, by any circumstance, the premiership should fall to the Opposition\r\nat a moment when the leadership of this element is in doubt, the crown\r\nwould be guided, similarly, by the informally expressed will of the\r\nmore influential party members. While, therefore, the appointment of\r\nthe prime minister remains the sole important governmental act which\r\nis performed directly by the sovereign, even here the substance of\r\npower has been lost and only the form survives.\r\n\r\n*70. Selection of Other Members.*--The remaining members of the cabinet\r\nare selected by the premier, in consultation, as a rule, with leading\r\nmembers of the party. Technically, what happens is that the first\r\nminister places in the hands of the sovereign a list of the men whom\r\nhe recommends for appointment to the principal offices of state. The\r\ncrown accepts the list and there appears forthwith in the London\r\nGazette an announcement to the effect that the persons named have been\r\nchosen by the crown to preside over the several departments.\r\nOfficially, there is no mention of the \"cabinet.\" In the selection of\r\nhis colleagues the premier theoretically has a free hand. Practically\r\nhe is bound by the necessity of complying with numerous principles and\r\nof observing various precedents and practical conditions. Two\r\nprinciples, in particular, must be adhered to in determining the\r\nstructure of every cabinet. All of the members must have seats in one\r\nor the other of the two houses of Parliament, and all must be\r\nidentified with the party in power, or, at the least, with an allied\r\npolitical group. There was a time, when the personal government of the\r\nking was yet a reality, when the House of Commons refused to admit to\r\nits membership persons who held office under the crown, and this\r\ndisqualification found legal expression as late as the Act of\r\nSettlement of 1701.[92] With the ripening of parliamentary government\r\nin the eighteenth century, however, the thing that once had been\r\nregarded properly enough as objectionable became a matter of\r\nunquestionable expediency, if not a necessity. When once the ministers\r\ncomprised the real executive of the nation it was but logical that\r\nthey should be authorized to appear on the floor of the two houses to\r\nintroduce and advocate measures and to explain the acts of the\r\ngovernment. Ministers had occupied regularly seats in the upper\r\nchamber, and not only was all objection to their occupying seats in\r\nthe lower chamber removed, but by custom it came to be an inflexible\r\nrule that cabinet officers, and indeed the ministers generally, should\r\nbe drawn exclusively from the membership of the two houses.[93]    (p. 068)\r\nUnder provision of an act of 1707 it is still obligatory upon\r\ncommoners who are tendered a cabinet appointment, with a few\r\nexceptions, to vacate their seats and to offer themselves to their\r\nconstituents for re-election. But re-election almost invariably\r\nfollows as a matter of course and without opposition.[94] It is to be\r\nobserved that there are two expedients by which it is possible to\r\nbring into the cabinet a desirable member who at the time of his\r\nappointment does not possess a seat in Parliament. The appointee may\r\nbe created a peer; or he may stand for election to the Commons and,\r\nwinning, qualify himself for a cabinet post.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 92: The clause of this measure which bore\r\n                   upon the point in hand was repealed, however,\r\n                   before it went into operation.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 93: The one notable instance in which\r\n                   this rule has been departed from within the past\r\n                   seventy-five years was Gladstone's tenure of the\r\n                   post of Secretary of State for the Colonies during\r\n                   the last six months of the Peel administration in\r\n                   1846.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 94: On the reasons for the requirement of\r\n                   re-election and the movement for the abolition of\r\n                   the requirement see Moran, The English Government,\r\n                   108-109.]\r\n\r\n*71. Distribution Between the Houses of Parliament.*--Since the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century the tenure of the premiership has been\r\ndivided approximately equally between peers and commoners, but the\r\napportionment of cabinet seats between the two houses has been\r\nextremely variable. The first cabinet of the reign of George III.\r\ncontained fourteen members, thirteen of whom had seats in the House of\r\nLords, and, in general, throughout the eighteenth century the peers\r\nwere apt greatly to preponderate. With the growth in importance of the\r\nHouse of Commons, however, and especially after the Reform Act of\r\n1832, the tendency was to draw an ever increasing proportion of the\r\ncabinet officers from the chamber in which lies the storm center of\r\nEnglish politics. By legal stipulation one of the secretaries of state\r\nmust sit in the upper house; and the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord\r\nChancellor, and the Lord President of the Council are all but\r\ninvariably peers. Beyond this, there is no positive requirement, in\r\neither law or custom. In the ministries of recent times the number of\r\npeers and of commoners has generally been not far from equal. To fill\r\nthe various posts the premier must bring together the best men he can\r\nsecure--not necessarily the ablest, but those who will work together\r\nmost effectively--with but secondary regard to the question of whether\r\nthey sit in the one or the other of the legislative houses. A\r\ndepartment whose chief sits in the Commons is certain to be\r\nrepresented in the Lords by an under-secretary or other spokesman, and\r\n_vice versa_.[95]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 95: In France and other continental\r\n                   countries in which the parliamentary system obtains\r\n                   an executive department is represented in\r\n                   Parliament by its presiding official only. But this\r\n                   official is privileged, as the English minister is\r\n                   not, to appear and to speak and otherwise\r\n                   participate in proceedings on the floor of either\r\n                   chamber.]\r\n\r\n*72. Political Solidarity.*--A second fundamental principle which  (p. 069)\r\ndominates the structure of the cabinet is that which requires that the\r\nmembers be men of one political faith. William III. sought to govern\r\nwith a cabinet in which there were both Whigs and Tories, but the\r\nresult was confusion and the experiment was abandoned. Except during\r\nthe ascendancy of Walpole, the cabinets of the eighteenth century very\r\ngenerally embraced men of more or less diverse political affiliations,\r\nbut gradually the conviction took root that in the interest of unity\r\nand efficiency the political solidarity of the cabinet group is\r\nindispensable. The last occasion upon which it was proposed to make up\r\na cabinet from utterly diverse political elements was in 1812. The\r\nscheme was rejected, and from that day to this cabinets have been\r\ncomposed regularly, not necessarily of men identified with a common\r\npolitical party, but at least of men who are in substantial agreement\r\nupon the larger questions of policy and who have expressed their\r\nwillingness to co-operate in the carrying out of a given programme of\r\naction. The fundamental requisite is unity. A Liberal Unionist may\r\noccupy a post in a Conservative cabinet and a Laborite in a Liberal\r\nadministration, but he may not oppose the Government upon any\r\nimportant question and expect to continue a member of it, save by the\r\nexpress permission of the premier. It is the obligation of every\r\ncabinet member to agree, or to appear to agree, with his colleagues.\r\nIf he is unable to do this, no course is open to him save resignation.\r\n\r\n*73. Other Considerations Determining Appointment.*--In the selection of\r\nhis colleagues the premier works under still other practical\r\nrestrictions. One of them is the well-established rule that surviving\r\nmembers of the last cabinet of the party, in so far as they are in\r\nactive public life and desirous of appointment, shall be given prior\r\nconsideration. Members of the party, furthermore, who have come into\r\nspecial prominence and influence in Parliament must usually be\r\nincluded. In truth, as Bagehot points out, the premier's independent\r\nchoice is apt to find scope not so much in the determination of the\r\ncabinet's personnel as in the distribution of offices among the\r\nmembers selected; and even here he will often be obliged to\r\nsubordinate his wishes to the inclinations, susceptibilities, and\r\ncapacities of his prospective colleagues. In the expressive simile of\r\nLowell, the premier's task is \"like that of constructing a figure out\r\nof blocks which are too numerous for the purpose, and which are not of\r\nshapes to fit perfectly together.\"[96]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 96: Government of England, I., 57. See\r\n                   MacDonaugh, The Book of Parliament, 148-183.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE CABINET IN ACTION                                         (p. 070)\r\n\r\n*74. Ministerial Responsibility.*--In its actual operation the English\r\ncabinet system involves the unvarying application of three principles:\r\n(1) the responsibility of cabinet ministers to Parliament; (2) the\r\nnon-publicity of cabinet proceedings; and (3) the close co-ordination\r\nof the cabinet group under the leadership of the premier. Every\r\nminister whether or not in the cabinet, is responsible individually to\r\nParliament, which in effect means to the House of Commons, for all of\r\nhis public acts. If he is accorded a vote of censure he must retire.\r\nIn the earlier eighteenth century the resignation of a cabinet officer\r\ndid not affect the tenure of his colleagues, the first of cabinets to\r\nretire as a unit being that of Lord North in 1782. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, the ministerial body so developed in compactness that in\r\nrelation to the outside world, and even to Parliament, the individual\r\nofficer came to be effectually subordinated to the group. Not since\r\n1866 has a cabinet member retired singly in consequence of an adverse\r\nparliamentary vote. If an individual minister falls into serious\r\ndisfavor one of two things almost certainly happens. Either the\r\noffending member is persuaded by his colleagues to modify his course\r\nor to resign before formal parliamentary censure shall have been\r\npassed, or the cabinet as a whole rallies to the support of the\r\nminister in question and stands or falls with him. This is but another\r\nway of saying that, in practice, the responsibility of the cabinet is\r\ncollective rather than individual, a condition by which the\r\nseriousness and effectiveness of it are vastly increased. This\r\nresponsibility covers the entire range of acts of the executive\r\ndepartment of the government, whether regarded as acts of the crown or\r\nof the ministers themselves, and it constitutes the most distinctive\r\nfeature of the English parliamentary system. Formerly the only means\r\nby which ministers could be held to account by Parliament was that of\r\nimpeachment. With the development, however, of the principle of\r\nministerial responsibility as a necessary adjunct to parliamentary\r\ngovernment, the occasional and violent process of impeachment was\r\nsuperseded by continuous, inescapable, and pacific legislative\r\nsupervision. The impeachment of cabinet ministers may be regarded,\r\nindeed, as obsolete.\r\n\r\n*75. How a Ministry may Be Overthrown.*--A fundamental maxim of the\r\nconstitution to-day is that a cabinet shall continue in office only so\r\nlong as it enjoys the confidence and support of a majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons. There are at least four ways in which a\r\nparliamentary majority may manifest its dissatisfaction with a\r\ncabinet, and so compel its resignation. It may pass a simple vote  (p. 071)\r\nof \"want of confidence,\" assigning therefor no definite reason. It may\r\npass a vote of censure, criticising the cabinet for some specific act.\r\nIt may defeat a measure which the cabinet advocates and declares to be\r\nof vital importance. Or it may pass a bill in opposition to the advice\r\nof the ministers. The cabinet is not obliged to give heed to an\r\nadverse vote in the Lords; but when any of the four votes indicated is\r\ncarried in the lower chamber the premier and his colleagues must do\r\none of two things--resign or appeal to the country. If it is clear\r\nthat the cabinet has lost the support, not only of Parliament, but\r\nalso of the electorate, the only honorable course for the ministry is\r\nthat of resignation. If, on the other hand, there is doubt as to\r\nwhether the parliamentary majority really represents the country upon\r\nthe matters at issue, the ministers are warranted in requesting the\r\nsovereign to dissolve Parliament and to order a general election. In\r\nsuch a situation the ministry continues tentatively in office. If at\r\nthe elections there is returned a majority disposed to support the\r\nministers, the cabinet is given a new lease of life. If, on the other\r\nhand, the new parliamentary majority is adverse, no course is open to\r\nthe ministry save to retire. The new parliament will be convoked at\r\nthe earliest practicable date; but in advance of its assembling the\r\ndefeated cabinet will generally have resigned and a new government,\r\npresided over by the leader of the late Opposition, will have assumed\r\nthe reins. During the interval required for the transfer of power none\r\nsave routine business is likely to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n*76. Secrecy of Proceedings.*--Perpetually responsible to the House of\r\nCommons and imperatively obligated to resign collectively when no\r\nlonger able to command a working majority in that body, the cabinet\r\nmust at all times employ every device by which it may be enabled to\r\npresent a solid and imposing front. Two such devices are those of\r\nsecrecy and the leadership of the premier. It is a sufficiently\r\nfamiliar principle that a group of men brought together to agree upon\r\nand execute a common policy in behalf of a widespread and diverse\r\nconstituency will be more likely to succeed if the differences that\r\nmust inevitably appear within their ranks are not published to the\r\nworld. It is in deference to this principle that the German Bundesrath\r\ntransacts its business to this day behind closed doors, and it was for\r\nan analogous reason that the public was excluded from the sittings of\r\nthe convention by which the present constitution of the United States\r\nwas framed. Notices of meetings of the English cabinet and the names\r\nof members present appear regularly in the press, but respecting the\r\nsubjects discussed, the opinions expressed, and the conclusions\r\narrived at not a word is given out, officially or unofficially.    (p. 072)\r\nThe oath of secrecy, required of all privy councillors, is binding in\r\na special degree upon the cabinet officer. Not even the sovereign is\r\nfavored with more than a statement of the topics considered, together\r\nwith occasionally a formal draft of such decisions as require his\r\nassent. In the earlier part of the nineteenth century meager minutes\r\nof the proceedings were preserved, but nowadays no clerical employee\r\nis allowed to be present and no record whatsoever is kept.[97] For\r\nknowledge of past transactions members rely upon their own or their\r\ncolleagues' memories, supplemented at times by privately kept notes.\r\nThe meetings, which are held only as occasion requires (usually as\r\noften as once a week when Parliament is in session) are notably\r\ninformal. There is not even a fixed place where meetings are held, the\r\nmembers being gathered sometimes at the Foreign Office, sometimes at\r\nthe premier's house, and, as circumstance may arise, at almost any\r\nconvenient place.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 97: The same thing is true of the\r\n                   President's cabinet in the United States. The\r\n                   reasons for the policy are obvious and ample; but\r\n                   the preservation of cabinet records, whether in\r\n                   Great Britain or the United States, would, if such\r\n                   records were to be made accessible, facilitate\r\n                   enormously the task of the historian and of the\r\n                   student of practical government.]\r\n\r\n*77. Leadership of the Premier.*--The unity of the cabinet is further\r\nsafeguarded and emphasized by the leadership of the prime minister.\r\nLong after the rise of the cabinet to controlling influence in the\r\nstate the members of the ministerial body continued supposedly upon a\r\ncommon footing in respect both to rank and authority. The habitual\r\nabstention of the early Hanoverians from attendance at cabinet\r\nmeetings, however, left the group essentially leaderless, and by a\r\nnatural process of development the members came gradually to recognize\r\na virtual presidency on the part of one of their own number. In time\r\nwhat was a mere presidency was converted into a thoroughgoing\r\nleadership, in short, into the premier's office of to-day. It is\r\ncommonly regarded that the first person who fulfilled the functions of\r\nprime minister in the modern sense was Sir Robert Walpole, First Lord\r\nof the Treasury from 1715 to 1717 and from 1721 to 1742. The phrase\r\n\"prime minister\" was not at that time in use, but that the realities\r\nof the office existed is indicated by a motion made in the Commons\r\nattacking Walpole on the ground that he had \"grasped in his own hands\r\nevery branch of government; had attained the sole direction of\r\naffairs; had monopolized all the powers of the crown; had compassed\r\nthe disposal of all places, pensions, titles, and rewards\"--almost\r\nprecisely, as one writer puts it, what the present premier is doing\r\nand is expected to do.[98] By the time of the establishment of     (p. 073)\r\nthe ministry of the younger Pitt, in 1783, the ascendancy of the\r\npremier among his colleagues was an accomplished fact and was\r\nrecognized as altogether legitimate. The enormous power of the\r\npremier, arising immediately upon the ruins of the royal prerogative,\r\nwas brought virtually to completion when, during the later years of\r\nGeorge III., the rule became fixed that in constituting a ministry the\r\nking should but ratify the choice of officials made by the premier.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 98: Moran, The English Government, 99.]\r\n\r\nNot until 1906 was the premier's office recognized by law,[99] but\r\nthrough more than a century no other public position in the nation has\r\nbeen comparable with it in volume of actual ruling power. Within the\r\nministry, more particularly the cabinet, the premier is the guiding\r\nforce. He presides, as a rule, at cabinet meetings; he advises with\r\ncolleagues upon all matters of consequence to the administration's\r\nwelfare; and, although he will shrink from doing it, he may require of\r\nhis colleagues that they acquiesce in his views, with the alternative\r\nof his resignation.[100] He occupies one of the high offices of state,\r\nusually that of First Lord of the Treasury; and, although ordinarily\r\nhis own portfolio will not require much of his time or energy, he must\r\nmaintain as close a watch as may be over the affairs of every one of\r\nthe departments in which his appointees have been placed. The prime\r\nminister, is, furthermore, the link between the cabinet and, on the\r\none hand, the crown, and, on the other, Parliament. On behalf of the\r\ncabinet he advises with the sovereign, communicating information\r\nrespecting ministerial acts and synopses of the daily debates in\r\nParliament. In the house of which he is a member he represents     (p. 074)\r\nthe cabinet as a whole, makes such statements as are necessary\r\nrelative to general aspects of the government's policy, and speaks, as\r\na rule, upon every general or important projected piece of\r\nlegislation. As a matter of both theory and historical fact, the\r\npremier who belongs to the House of Commons is more advantageously\r\nsituated than one who sits in the Lords.[101]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 99: In a statute fixing the order of\r\n                   precedence of public dignitaries.

The deputation had called\r\n                   to protest against the Government's announced\r\n                   purpose to attach a suffrage amendment (if carried\r\n                   in the House of Commons) to a forthcoming measure\r\n                   of franchise reform. The Premier explained that he\r\n                   was, and always had been, of the opinion that \"the\r\n                   grant of the parliamentary franchise to women in\r\n                   this country would be a political mistake of a very\r\n                   grievous kind.\" \"So far,\" he continued, \"we are in\r\n                   complete harmony with one another. On the other\r\n                   hand, I am, as you know, for the time being the\r\n                   head of the Government, in which a majority of my\r\n                   colleagues, a _considerable_ majority of my\r\n                   colleagues--I may say that without violating the\r\n                   obligation of cabinet secrecy...--are of a\r\n                   different opinion; and the Government in those\r\n                   circumstances has announced a policy which is the\r\n                   result of their combined deliberations, and by\r\n                   which it is the duty of all their members, and\r\n                   myself not least, to abide loyally. That is the\r\n                   position, so far as I am personally concerned.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 101: Low, The Governance of England,\r\n                   Chap. 9; M.

The Cabinet's Central Position.*--In the English governmental\r\nsystem the cabinet is in every sense the keystone of the arch. Its\r\nfunctions are both executive and legislative, and indeed, to employ\r\nthe figure of Bagehot, it comprises the hyphen that joins, the buckle\r\nthat fastens, the executive and the legislative departments\r\ntogether.[102] As has been pointed out, the uses of the crown are by\r\nno means wholly ornamental. None the less, the actual executive of the\r\nnation is the cabinet. It is within the cabinet circle that\r\nadministrative policies are decided upon, and it is by the cabinet\r\nministers and their subordinates in the several departments that these\r\npolicies, and the laws of the land generally, are carried into effect.\r\nOn the other side, the cabinet members not only occupy seats in one or\r\nthe other of the houses of Parliament; collectively they direct the\r\nprocesses of legislation. They--primarily the prime minister--prepare\r\nthe Speech from the Throne, in which at the opening of a parliamentary\r\nsession the state of the country is reviewed and a programme of\r\nlegislation is outlined. They formulate, introduce, explain, and\r\nadvocate needful legislative measures upon all manner of subjects; and\r\nalthough bills may be submitted in either house by private members it\r\nis a recognized principle that all measures of large importance shall\r\nemanate directly or indirectly from the cabinet. Statistics\r\ndemonstrate that measures introduced by private members have but an\r\ninfinitesimal chance of enactment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 102: The English Constitution (new ed.),\r\n                   79.]\r\n\r\nIn effect, the cabinet comprises a parliamentary committee chosen, as\r\nBagehot bluntly puts it, to rule the nation. If a cabinet group does\r\nnot represent the ideas and purposes of Parliament as a whole, it at\r\nleast represents those of the majority of the preponderating chamber;\r\nand that is ample to give it, during the space of its tenure of\r\noffice, a thoroughgoing command of the situation. The basal fact of\r\nthe political system is the control of party, and within the party the\r\npower that governs is the cabinet. \"The machinery,\" says Lowell, \"is\r\none of wheels within wheels; the outside ring consisting of the    (p. 075)\r\nparty that has a majority in the House of Commons; the next ring being\r\nthe ministry, which contains the men who are most active within that\r\nparty; and the smallest of all being the cabinet, containing the real\r\nleaders or chiefs. By this means is secured that unity of party action\r\nwhich depends upon placing the directing power in the hands of a body\r\nsmall enough to agree, and influential enough to control.\"[103]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 103: Government of England, I., 56.

Antiquity and Importance.*--The British Parliament is at once the\r\noldest, the most comprehensive in jurisdiction, and the most powerful\r\namong modern legislative assemblages. In structure, and to some extent\r\nin function, it is a product, as has appeared, of the Middle Ages. The\r\nterm \"parliament,\" employed originally to denote a discussion or\r\nconference, was applied officially to the Great Council in 1275;[104]\r\nand by the opening of the fourteenth century the institution which the\r\nEnglish know to-day by that name had come clearly into existence,\r\nbeing then, indeed, what technically it still is--the king and the\r\nthree estates of the realm, i.e., the lords spiritual, the lords\r\ntemporal, and the commons. During upwards of a hundred years the three\r\nestates sat and deliberated separately. By the close of the reign of\r\nEdward III. (1327-1377), however, the bicameral principle had become\r\nfixed, and throughout the whole of its subsequent history (save during\r\nthe Cromwellian era of experimentation) Parliament has comprised\r\nuninterruptedly, aside from the king, the two branches which exist at\r\nthe present time, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, or,\r\nstrictly, the Lords of Parliament and the Representatives of the\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 104: In the First Statute of\r\n                   Westminster.]\r\n\r\nThe range of jurisdiction which, step by step, these chambers, both\r\nseparately and conjointly, have acquired has been broadened until, so\r\nfar as the dominions of the British crown extend, it covers all but\r\nthe whole of the domain of human government. And within this enormous\r\nexpanse of political control the competence of the chambers knows, in\r\nneither theory nor fact, any restriction. \"The British Parliament, ...\"\r\nwrites Mr. Bryce, \"can make and unmake any and every law, change\r\nthe form of government or the succession to the crown, interfere with\r\nthe course of justice, extinguish the most sacred private rights of\r\nthe citizen. Between it and the people at large there is no legal\r\ndistinction, because the whole plenitude of the people's rights and\r\npowers resides in it, just as if the whole nation were present within\r\nthe chamber where it sits. In point of legal theory it is the nation,\r\nbeing the historical successor of the Folk Moot of our Teutonic\r\nforefathers. Both practically and legally, it is to-day the only   (p. 077)\r\nand the sufficient depository of the authority of the nation; and\r\nit is therefore, within the sphere of law, irresponsible and\r\nomnipotent.\"[105] Whether the business in hand be constituent or\r\nlegislative, whether ecclesiastical or temporal, the right of\r\nParliament--or, more accurately \"the King in Parliament\"--to discuss\r\nand to dispose is indisputable.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 105: The American Commonwealth (3d ed.),\r\n                   I., 35-36.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PRIOR TO 1832\r\n\r\n*80. Present Ascendancy.*--Legally, as has been explained, Parliament\r\nconsists of the king, the lords spiritual, the lords temporal, and the\r\ncommons. For practical purposes, however, it is the House of Commons\r\nalone. \"When,\" as Spencer Walpole wrote a quarter of a century ago, \"a\r\nminister consults Parliament he consults the House of Commons; when\r\nthe Queen dissolves Parliament she dissolves the House of Commons. A\r\nnew Parliament is simply a new House of Commons.\"[106] The gathering\r\nof the \"representatives of the commons\" at Westminster is, and has\r\nlong been, without question the most important agency of government in\r\nthe kingdom. The House of Commons consists at the present day of 670\r\nmembers, of whom 465 sit for English constituencies, 30 for Welsh, 72\r\nfor Scottish, and 103 for Irish. Nine of the members are chosen, under\r\nsomewhat special conditions, by the universities, but the remaining\r\n661 are elected in county or borough constituencies under franchise\r\narrangements, which, while based upon residence and property\r\nqualifications, fall not far short of manhood suffrage. The chamber is\r\nat the same time the preponderating repository of power in the\r\nnational government and the prime organ of the popular will. It is in\r\nconsequence of its prolonged and arduous development that Great\r\nBritain has attained democracy in national government; and the\r\ninfluence of English democracy as actualized in the House of Commons\r\nupon the political ideas and the governmental agencies of the outlying\r\nworld, both English-speaking and non-English-speaking, is simply\r\nincalculable.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 106: The Electorate and the Legislature\r\n                   (London, 1892), 48.]\r\n\r\n*81. Undemocratic Character at the Opening of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.*--\"The virtue, the spirit, the essence of the House of\r\nCommons,\" once declared Edmund Burke, \"consists in its being the\r\nexpress image of the nation.\" In the eighteenth century, however, when\r\nthis assertion was made, the House of Commons was, in point of fact,\r\nfar from constituting such an \"image.\" Until, indeed, the nineteenth\r\ncentury was well advanced the nominally popular parliamentary branch\r\nwas in reality representative, not of the mass of the nation, but  (p. 078)\r\nof the aristocratic and governing elements, at best of the well-to-do\r\nmiddle classes; and a correct appreciation of the composition and\r\ncharacter of the chamber as it to-day exists requires some allusion to\r\nthe process by which its democratization was accomplished. In\r\n1832--the year of the first great Reform Act--the House of Commons\r\nconsisted of 658 members, of whom 186 represented the forty counties\r\nand 472 sat for two hundred three boroughs. The apportionment of both\r\ncounty and borough members was haphazard and grossly inequitable. In\r\nthe Unites States, and in many European countries, it is required by\r\nconstitutional provision that following a decennial census there shall\r\nbe a reapportionment of seats in the popular legislative chamber, the\r\npurpose being, of course, to preserve substantial equality among the\r\nelectoral constituencies and, ultimately, an essential parity of\r\npolitical power among the voters. At no time, however, has there been\r\nin Great Britain either legislation or the semblance of a tradition in\r\nrespect to this matter. Reapportionment has taken place only partially\r\nand at irregular intervals, and at but a few times in the history of\r\nthe nation have constituencies represented at Westminster been even\r\napproximately equal. Save that, in 1707, forty-five members were added\r\nto represent Scotland and, in 1801, one hundred to sit for Ireland,\r\nthe identity of the constituencies represented in the Commons\r\ncontinued all but unchanged from the reign of Charles II. to the\r\nreform of 1832.\r\n\r\n*82. Need of a Redistribution of Seats.*--The population changes, in\r\nrespect to both growth and distribution, falling within this extended\r\nperiod were, however, enormous. In 1689 the population of England and\r\nWales was not in excess of 5,500,000. The census of 1831 revealed in\r\nthese countries a population of 14,000,000. In the seventeenth and\r\nearlier eighteenth centuries the great mass of the English people\r\nlived in the south and east. Liverpool was but an insignificant town,\r\nManchester a village, and Birmingham a sand-hill. But the industrial\r\nrevolution had the effect of bringing coal, iron, and water-power into\r\nenormous demand, and after 1775 the industrial center, and likewise\r\nthe population center, of the country was shifted rapidly toward the\r\nnorth. In the hitherto almost uninhabited valleys of Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire sprang up a multitude of factory towns and cities. In\r\nParliament these fast-growing populations were either glaringly\r\nunder-represented or not represented at all. In 1831 the ten\r\nsouthernmost counties of England contained a population of 3,260,000\r\nand returned to Parliament 235 members.[107] At the same time the six\r\nnorthernmost counties contained a population of 3,594,000, but     (p. 079)\r\nreturned only 68 members. Cornwall, with 300,000 inhabitants, had 42\r\nrepresentatives; Lancashire, with 1,330,000, had 14. Among towns,\r\nBirmingham and Manchester, each with upwards of 100,000 people, and\r\nLeeds and Sheffield, each with 50,000, had no representation whatever.\r\nOn the other hand, boroughs were entitled to representation which\r\ncontained ridiculously scant populations, or even no population at\r\nall. Gatto, in Surrey, was a park; Old Sarum, in Wiltshire, was a\r\ndeserted hill; the remains of what once was Dunwich were under the\r\nwaves of the North Sea. Bosseney, in Cornwall, was a hamlet of three\r\ncottages, eight of whose nine electors belonged to a single family.\r\nBut Bosseney sent two members to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 107: That is to say, the quota of members\r\n                   mentioned was returned by the counties and by the\r\n                   boroughs contained geographically within them.]\r\n\r\n*83. County and Borough Franchise in 1831.*--Not only was there, thus,\r\nthe most glaring lack of adjustment of parliamentary representation to\r\nthe distribution of population; where the right of representation\r\nexisted, the franchise arrangements under which members were elected\r\nwere hopelessly heterogeneous and illiberal. Originally, as has been\r\npointed out,[108] the representatives of the counties were chosen in\r\nthe county court by all persons who were entitled to attend and to\r\ntake part in the proceedings of that body. In 1429, during the reign\r\nof Henry VI., an act was passed ostensibly to prevent riotous and\r\ndisorderly elections, wherein it was stipulated that county electors\r\nshould thereafter comprise only such male residents of the county as\r\npossessed free land or tenement which would rent for as much as forty\r\nshillings a year above all charges.[109] Leaseholders, copyholders,\r\nsmall freeholders, and all non-landholders were denied the suffrage\r\naltogether. Even in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the number\r\nof forty-shilling freeholders was small. With the concentration of\r\nland in fewer hands, incident to the agrarian revolution of the\r\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, it bore an increasingly\r\ndiminutive ratio to the aggregate county population, and by 1832 the\r\ncounty electors comprised, as a rule, only a handful of large landed\r\nproprietors. Within the boroughs the franchise arrangements existing\r\nat the date mentioned were complicated and diverse beyond the\r\npossibility of general characterization. Many of the boroughs had been\r\naccorded parliamentary representation by the most arbitrary and\r\nhaphazard methods, and at no time prior to 1830 was there legislation\r\nwhich so much as attempted to regulate the conditions of voting within\r\nthem. There were \"scot and lot\" boroughs, \"potwalloper\" boroughs,\r\nburgage boroughs, corporation or \"close\" boroughs, and \"freemen\"\r\nboroughs, to mention only the more important of the types that     (p. 080)\r\ncan be distinguished.[110] In some of these the franchise was, at\r\nleast in theory, fairly democratic; but in most of them it was\r\nrestricted by custom or local regulation to petty groups of\r\nproperty-holders or taxpayers, to members of the municipal\r\ncorporations, or even to members of a favored guild. With few\r\nexceptions, the borough franchise was illogical, exclusive, and\r\nnon-expansive.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 108: See p. 23.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 109: Equivalent in present values to £30\r\n                   or £40.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 110: See p. 23.]\r\n\r\n*84. Political Corruption.*--A third fact respecting electoral\r\nconditions in the earlier nineteenth century is the astounding\r\nprevalence of illegitimate political influence and of sheer\r\ncorruption. Borough members were very commonly not true\r\nrepresentatives at all, but nominees of peers, of influential\r\ncommoners, or of the government. It has been estimated that of the 472\r\nborough members not more than 137 may be regarded as having been in\r\nany proper sense elected. The remainder sat for \"rotten\" boroughs, or\r\nfor \"pocket\" boroughs whose populations were so meager or so docile\r\nthat the borough might, as it were, be carried about in a magnate's\r\npocket. In the whole of Cornwall there were only one thousand voters.\r\nOf the forty-two seats possessed by that section of the country twenty\r\nwere controlled by seven peers, twenty-one were similarly controlled\r\nby eleven commoners, and but one was filled by free election. In 1780\r\nit was asserted by the Duke of Richmond that a clear majority of the\r\nHouse of Commons was returned by six thousand persons. Bribery and\r\nother forms of corruption were so common that only the most shameless\r\ninstances attracted public attention. Not merely votes, but seats,\r\nwere bought and sold openly, and it was a matter of general\r\nunderstanding that £5,000 to £7,000 was the amount which a political\r\naspirant might expect to be obliged to pay a borough-monger for\r\nbringing about his election. Seats were not infrequently advertised\r\nfor sale in the public prints, and even for hire for a term of\r\nyears.[111]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 111: The monumental treatise on the House\r\n                   of Commons prior to 1832 is E.

PARLIAMENTARY REFORM, 1832-1885\r\n\r\n*85. Demand for Reform Prior to 1832.*--Active demand for a reformation\r\nof the conditions that have been described antedated the nineteenth\r\ncentury. As early as 1690, indeed, John Locke denounced the\r\nabsurdities of the prevailing electoral system,[112] although at the\r\ntime they were inconsiderable in comparison with what they became by\r\n1832; and during the second half of the eighteenth century a       (p. 081)\r\nnumber of interesting reform proposals--notably that of the elder Pitt\r\nin 1766, that of Wilkes in 1776, and that of the younger Pitt in\r\n1785--were widely though fruitlessly discussed. In 1780 a group of\r\npublic-spirited men established a Society for Constitutional\r\nInformation which during the ensuing decade carried on actively a\r\npropaganda in behalf of parliamentary regeneration, and at a meeting\r\nunder the auspices of this organization and presided over by Charles\r\nJames Fox a programme was drawn up insisting upon innovations no less\r\nsweeping than the establishment of manhood suffrage, the creation of\r\nequal electoral districts, the payment of members, the abolition of\r\nproperty qualifications for members, and adoption of the secret\r\nballot.[113] The revolution in France and the prolonged contest with\r\nNapoleon stayed the reform movement, but after 1815 agitation was\r\nactively renewed. The economic and social ills of the nation in the\r\ndecade following the restoration of peace were many, and the idea took\r\nhold widely that only through a reconstitution of Parliament could\r\nadequate measures of amelioration be attained. The disposition of the\r\nTory governments of the period was to resist the popular demand, or,\r\nat the most, to concede changes which would not affect the\r\naristocratic character of the parliamentary chambers. But the\r\nreformers refused to be diverted from their fundamental object, and in\r\nthe end the forces of tradition, conservatism, and vested interest\r\nwere obliged to give way.[114]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 112: Treatises of Government, II., Chap.\r\n                   13, § 157.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 113: It is of interest to observe that\r\n                   every one of the demands enumerated found a place\r\n                   half a century later among the \"six points\" of the\r\n                   Chartists.

A\r\n                   second society--The Friends of the People--was\r\n                   formed in 1792 to promote the cause.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 114: The reform movement prior to 1832 is\r\n                   admirably sketched in May and Holland,\r\n                   Constitutional History of England, I., 264-280.

The changes wrought by this\r\nmemorable piece of legislation were two-fold, the first relating to\r\nthe distribution of seats in Parliament, the second to the extension\r\nof the franchise. The number of Scottish members was increased from 45\r\nto 54; that of Irish, from 100 to 105; that of English and Welsh was\r\nreduced from 513 to 499. There was no general reapportionment of seats,\r\nno effort to bring the parliamentary constituencies into precise and\r\nuniform relation to the census returns. But the most glaringly\r\ninequitable of former conditions were remedied. Fifty-six          (p. 082)\r\nboroughs, of populations under 2,000, were deprived entirely of\r\nrepresentation,[115] thirty-one, of populations between 2,000 and\r\n4,000, were reduced from two members to one, and one was reduced from\r\nfour members to two. The 143 seats thus made available were\r\nredistributed, and the aggregate number (658) continued as before.\r\nTwenty-two large boroughs hitherto unrepresented were given two\r\nmembers each; twenty-one others were given one additional member each;\r\nand a total of sixty-five seats were allotted to twenty-seven of the\r\nEnglish counties, the remaining thirteen being given to Scotland and\r\nIreland. The redistribution had the effect of increasing markedly the\r\npolitical power of the northern and north-central portions of the\r\ncountry. The alterations introduced in the franchise were numerous and\r\nimportant. In the counties the forty-shilling freehold franchise, with\r\nsome limitations, was retained; but the voting privilege was extended\r\nto all leaseholders and copyholders of land renting for as much as £10\r\na year, and to tenants-at-will holding an estate worth £50 a year. In\r\nthe boroughs the right to vote was conferred upon all \"occupiers\" of\r\nhouses worth £10 a year. The total number of persons enfranchised was\r\napproximately 455,000. By basing the franchise exclusively upon the\r\nownership or occupancy of property of considerable value the reform\r\nfell short of admitting to political power the great mass of factory\r\nemployees and of agricultural laborers, and for this reason it was\r\nroundly opposed by the more advanced liberal elements. If, however,\r\nthe voting privilege had not been extended to the masses it had been\r\nbrought appreciably nearer them; and--what was almost equally\r\nimportant--it had been made substantially uniform, for the first time,\r\nthroughout the realm.[116]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 115: Of the fifty-six all save one had\r\n                   returned two members.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 116: The more important parts of the text\r\n                   of the Reform Bill of 1832 are printed in\r\n                   Robertson, Statutes, Cases and Documents, 197-212.]\r\n\r\n*87. The Chartist Movement.*--The act of 1832 possessed none of the\r\nelements of finality. Its authors were in general content, but with\r\nthe lapse of time it was made increasingly manifest that the nation\r\nwas not. Political power was still confined to the magnates of the\r\nkingdom, the townsfolk who were able to pay a £10 annual rental, and\r\nthe well-to-do copyholders and leaseholders of rural districts. Whigs\r\nand Tories of influence alike insisted that further innovation could\r\nnot be contemplated, but the radicals and the laboring masses insisted\r\nno less resolutely that the reformation which had been begun should be\r\ncarried to its logical conclusion. The demands upon which emphasis was\r\nespecially placed were gathered up in the \"six points\" of the People's\r\nCharter, promulgated in final form May 8, 1838. The six points were:\r\n(1) universal suffrage for males over twenty-one years of age,     (p. 083)\r\n(2) equal electoral districts, (3) voting by secret ballot, (4) annual\r\nsessions of Parliament, (5) the abolition of property qualifications\r\nfor members of the House of Commons, and (6) payment of members. The\r\nbarest enumeration of these demands is sufficient to reveal the\r\npolitical backwardness of the England of three-quarters of a century\r\nago. Not only was the suffrage still severely restricted and the basis\r\nof representation antiquated and unfair; voting was oral and public,\r\nand only men who were qualified by the possession of property were\r\neligible for election.[117]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 117: Rose, Rise and Growth of Democracy,\r\n                   Chaps. 6-8; Kent, The English Radicals, Chap. 3;\r\n                   and R. G. Gammage, History of the Chartist\r\n                   Movement, 1837-1854 (Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1894).]\r\n\r\n*88. The Representation of the People Act of 1867.*--After a decade of\r\nspectacular propaganda Chartism collapsed, without having attained\r\ntangible results. None the less, the day was not long postponed when\r\nthe forces of reform, sobered and led by practical statesmen, were\r\nenabled to realize one after another of their fundamental purposes. In\r\n1858 the second Derby government acquiesced in the enactment of a\r\nmeasure by which all property qualifications hitherto required of\r\nEnglish, Welsh, and Irish members were abolished,[118] and after 1860\r\nprojects for franchise extension were considered with increasing\r\nseriousness. In 1867 the third Derby government, whose guiding spirit\r\nwas Disraeli, carried a bill providing for an electoral reform of a\r\nmore thoroughgoing character than any persons save the most\r\nuncompromising of the radicals had ever asked or desired. This\r\nRepresentation of the People Act modified but slightly the\r\ndistribution of parliamentary seats. The total number of seats\r\nremained unchanged, as did Ireland's quota of 105; Scotland's\r\napportionment was increased from 54 to 60, while that of England and\r\nWales was decreased from 499 to 493; and in the course of the\r\nre-allotment that was made eleven boroughs lost the right of\r\nrepresentation and thirty-five others were reduced from two members to\r\none. The fifty-two seats thus vacated were utilized to enfranchise\r\ntwelve new borough and three university constituencies and to increase\r\nthe representation of a number of the more populous towns and\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 118: By law of 1710 it had been required\r\n                   that county members should possess landed property\r\n                   worth £600, and borough members worth £300, a year.\r\n                   These qualifications were very commonly evaded, but\r\n                   they were not abolished until 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe most important provisions of the Act were, however, those relating\r\nto the franchise. In England and Wales the county franchise was\r\nguaranteed to men whose freehold was of the value of forty shillings a\r\nyear, to copyholders and leaseholders of the annual value of £5, and\r\nto householders whose rent amounted to not less than £12 a year.   (p. 084)\r\nThe twelve pound occupation franchise was new,[119] and the\r\nqualification for copyholders and leaseholders was reduced from £10 to\r\n£5; otherwise the county franchise was unchanged. The borough\r\nfranchise was modified profoundly. Heretofore persons were qualified\r\nto vote as householders only in the event that their house was worth\r\nas much as £10 a year. Now the right was conferred upon every man who\r\noccupied, as owner or as tenant, for twelve months, a dwelling-house,\r\nor any portion thereof utilized as a separate dwelling, without regard\r\nto its value. Another newly established franchise admitted to the\r\nvoting privilege all lodgers occupying for as much as a year rooms of\r\nthe clear value, unfurnished, of £10 a year. The effect of these\r\nprovisions was to enfranchise the urban working population, even as\r\nthe act of 1832 had enfranchised principally the urban middle class.\r\nSo broad, indeed, did the urban franchise at this point become that\r\nlittle room was left for its modification subsequently. As originally\r\nplanned, Disraeli's measure would have enlarged the electorate by not\r\nmore than 100,000; as amended and carried, it practically doubled the\r\nvoting population, raising it from 1,370,793 immediately prior to 1867\r\nto 2,526,423 in 1871.[120] By the act of 1832 the middle classes had\r\nbeen enfranchised; by that of 1867 political power was thrown in no\r\nsmall degree into the hands of the masses. Only two large groups of\r\npeople remained now outside the pale of political influence, i.e., the\r\nagricultural laborers and the miners.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 119: It may be regarded, however, as\r\n                   taking the place of the £50 rental franchise.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 120: It is to be observed that these\r\n                   figures are for the United Kingdom as a whole,\r\n                   embracing the results not merely of the act of 1867\r\n                   applying to England and Wales but of the two acts\r\n                   of 1868 introducing similar, though not identical,\r\n                   changes in Scotland and Ireland.]\r\n\r\n*89. The Representation of the People Act of 1884.*--That the\r\nqualifications for voting in one class of constituencies should be\r\nconspicuously more liberal than in another class was an anomaly, and\r\nin a period when anomalies were at last being eliminated from the\r\nEnglish electoral system remedy could not be long delayed. February 5,\r\n1884, the second Gladstone ministry redeemed a campaign pledge by\r\nintroducing a bill extending to the counties the same electoral\r\nregulations that had been established in 1867 in the towns. The\r\nmeasure passed the Commons, but was rejected by the Lords by reason of\r\nthe fact that it was not accompanied by a bill for the redistribution\r\nof seats. By an agreement between the two houses a threatened deadlock\r\nwas averted, and the upshot was that before the end of the year the\r\nLords accepted the Government's bill, on the understanding that its\r\nenactment was to be followed immediately by the introduction of a\r\nredistribution measure. The Representation of the People Act of    (p. 085)\r\n1884 is in form disjointed and difficult to understand, but the effect\r\nof it is easy to state. By it there was established a uniform\r\nhousehold franchise and a uniform lodger franchise in all counties and\r\nboroughs of the United Kingdom. The occupation of any land or tenement\r\nof a clear annual value of £10 was made a qualification in boroughs\r\nand counties alike; and persons occupying a house by virtue of office\r\nor employment were to be deemed \"occupiers\" for the purpose of the\r\nact. The measure doubled the county electorate and increased the total\r\nelectorate by some 2,000,000, or approximately forty per cent. Its\r\nmost important effect was to enfranchise the workingman in the\r\ncountry, as the act of 1867 had enfranchised the workingman in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n*90. The Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885.*--In 1885, the two great\r\nparties co-operating, there was passed the Redistribution of Seats Act\r\nwhich had been promised. Now for the first time in English history\r\nattempt was made to apportion representation in the House of Commons\r\nin something like strict accordance with population densities. In the\r\nfirst place, the total number of members was increased from 658[121]\r\nto 670, and of the number 103 were allotted to Ireland, 72 to\r\nScotland, and 495 to England and Wales. In the next place, the method\r\nby which former redistributions had been accomplished, i.e.,\r\ntransferring seats more or less arbitrarily from flagrantly\r\nover-represented boroughs to more populous boroughs and counties, was\r\nreplaced by a method based upon the principle of equal electoral\r\nconstituencies, each returning one member. In theory a constituency\r\nwas made to comprise 50,000 people. Boroughs containing fewer than\r\n15,000 inhabitants were disfranchised as boroughs, becoming for\r\nelectorial purposes portions of the counties in which they were\r\nsituated. Boroughs of between 15,000 and 50,000 inhabitants were\r\nallowed to retain, or if previously unrepresented were given, one\r\nmember each. Those of between 50,000 and 165,000 were given two\r\nmembers, and those of more than 165,000 three, with one in addition\r\nfor every additional 50,000 people. The same general principle was\r\nfollowed in the counties. Thus the city of Liverpool, which prior to\r\n1885 sent three members to Parliament, fell into nine distinct\r\nconstituencies, each returning one member, and the great northern\r\ncounty of Lancashire, which since 1867 had been divided into four\r\nportions each returning two members, was now split into twenty-three\r\ndivisions with one member each. The boroughs which prior to 1885\r\nelected two members, and at the redistribution retained that number,\r\nremained single constituencies for the election of those two members.\r\nOf these boroughs there are to-day twenty-three. They, together    (p. 086)\r\nwith the city of London and the three universities of Oxford,\r\nCambridge, and Dublin, comprise the existing twenty-seven two-member\r\nconstituencies. By partition of the counties, of the old boroughs\r\nhaving more than two members, and of the new boroughs with only two\r\nmembers, all save these twenty-seven constituencies have been erected\r\ninto separate, single-member electoral divisions, each with its own\r\nname and identity.[122]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 121: Strictly 652, since after 1867 four\r\n                   boroughs, returning six members, were\r\n                   disfranchised.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 122: On the reforms of the period\r\n                   1832-1885 see Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap.\r\n                   18, and XI., Chap. 12; Dickinson, Development of\r\n                   Parliament, Chap. 2; Rose, Rise and Growth of\r\n                   Democracy, Chaps. 2, 10-13; Marriott, English\r\n                   Political Institutions, Chap. 10.

THE FRANCHISE AND THE ELECTORAL QUESTIONS OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\n*91. The Franchise as It Is.*--By the measures of 1884 and 1885 the\r\nHouse of Commons was placed upon a broadly democratic basis. Both\r\nmeasures stand to-day upon the statute-books, and neither has been\r\namended in any important particular. With respect to the existing\r\nfranchises there are two preponderating facts. One of them is that\r\nindividuals, as such, do not possess the privilege of voting; on the\r\ncontrary, the possession of the privilege is determined all but\r\ninvariably in relation to the ownership or occupation of property. The\r\nother is that the franchise system, while substantially uniform\r\nthroughout the kingdom, is none the less the most complicated in\r\nEurope. There are three important franchises which are universal and\r\ntwo which are not. In the first group are included: (1) occupancy, as\r\nowner or tenant, of land or tenement of a clear yearly value of £10;\r\n(2) occupancy, as owner or tenant, of a dwelling-house, or part of a\r\nhouse used as a separate dwelling, without regard to its value;    (p. 087)\r\nand (3) occupancy of lodgings of the value, unfurnished, of £10 a\r\nyear. The two franchises which are not universal are (1) ownership of\r\nland of forty shillings yearly value or occupation of land under\r\ncertain other specified conditions--this being applicable only to\r\ncounties and, to a small extent, to boroughs which are counties in\r\nthemselves; and (2) residence of freemen in those towns in which they\r\nhad a right to vote prior to 1832. The conditions and exceptions by\r\nwhich these various franchises are attended are so numerous that few\r\npeople in England save lawyers make a pretense of knowing them all,\r\nand the volume of litigation which arises from the attempted\r\ndistinction between \"householder\" and \"lodger,\" and from other\r\ntechnicalities of the subject, is enormous. Voters must be twenty-one\r\nyears of age, and there are several complicated requirements in\r\nrespect to the period of occupation of land and of residence, and\r\nlikewise in respect to the fulfillment of the formalities of\r\nregistration.[123] There are also various incidental disqualifications.\r\nNo peer, other than a peer of Ireland who is in possession of a seat\r\nin the House of Commons, may vote; persons employed as election\r\nagents, canvassers, clerks, or messengers may not vote, nor may the\r\nreturning officers of the constituencies, save when necessary to break\r\na tie between two candidates; and aliens, felons, and, under\r\nstipulated conditions, persons in receipt of public charity, are\r\nsimilarly debarred. In the aggregate, however, the existing franchises\r\napproach measurably near manhood suffrage. It has been computed that\r\nthe ratio of electors to population is approximately one in six,\r\nwhereas, the normal proportion of males above the age of twenty-one,\r\nmaking no allowance for paupers, criminals, and other persons commonly\r\ndisqualified by law, is somewhat less than one in four. The only\r\nclasses of adult males at present excluded regularly from the voting\r\nprivilege are domestic servants, bachelors living with their parents\r\nand occupying no premises on their own account, and persons whose\r\nchange of abode periodically deprives them of a vote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 123: On the process of registration see\r\n                   Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, I.,\r\n                   134-137, and M. Caudel, L'enregistrement des\r\n                   électeurs en Angleterre, in _Annales des Sciences\r\n                   Politiques_, Sept., 1906.]\r\n\r\n\"The present condition of the franchise,\" asserts Lowell, \"is, indeed,\r\nhistorical rather than rational. It is complicated, uncertain,\r\nexpensive in the machinery required, and excludes a certain number of\r\npeople whom there is no reason for excluding, while it admits many\r\npeople who ought not to be admitted if any one is to be debarred.\"[124]\r\nDuring the past generation there has been demand from a variety    (p. 088)\r\nof quarters that the conditions of the franchise, and, indeed, the\r\nelectoral system as a whole, be overhauled, co-ordinated, and\r\nliberalized; and at the date of writing (1912) there is pending in\r\nParliament a measure of fundamental importance looking in this\r\ndirection. The electoral changes which have been most widely\r\nadvocated, at least in recent years, are four in number: (1) a fresh\r\napportionment of seats in the Commons in accordance with the\r\ndistribution of population; (2) the extension of the franchise to\r\nclasses of men at present debarred; (3) the abolition of the plural\r\nvote; and (4) the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 124: Government of England, I., 213.

The Question of Redistribution of Seats.*--As has been pointed out,\r\nthe Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885 established constituencies in\r\nwhich there was some approach to equality. The principle was far from\r\ncompletely carried out. For example, the newly created borough of\r\nChelsea contained upwards of 90,000 people, while the old borough of\r\nWindsor had fewer than 20,000. But the inequalities left untouched by\r\nthe act were slight in comparison with those which have arisen during\r\na quarter of a century in which there has been no reapportionment\r\nwhatsoever. In 1901 the least populous constituency of the United\r\nKingdom, the borough of Newry in Ireland, contained but 13,137 people,\r\nwhile the southern division of the county of Essex contained 217,030;\r\nyet each was represented by a single member. This means, of course, a\r\ngross disparity in the weight of popular votes, and, in effect, the\r\nover-representation of certain sets of opinions and interests. In\r\nJanuary, 1902, an amendment to a parliamentary address urging the\r\ndesirability of redistribution was warmly debated in the Commons, and,\r\non the eve of its fall, in the summer of 1905, the Balfour government\r\nsubmitted a Redistribution Resolution designed to meet the demands of\r\nthe \"one vote, one value\" propagandists. At this time it was pointed\r\nout that whereas immediately after the reform of 1885 the greatest\r\nratio of disparity among the constituencies was 5.8 to 1, in twenty\r\nyears it had risen to 16.5 to 1. The plan proposed provided for the\r\nfixing of the average population to be represented by a member at from\r\n50,000 to 65,000, the giving of eighteen additional seats to England\r\nand Wales and of four to Scotland, the reduction of Ireland's quota by\r\ntwenty-two, and such further readjustments as would bring down the\r\nratio of greatest disparity to 6.8 to 1. Under a ruling of the Speaker\r\nto the effect that the resolution required to be divided into eight or\r\nnine parts, to be debated separately, the proposal was withdrawn. It\r\nwas announced that a bill upon the subject would be brought in, but\r\nthe early retirement of the ministry rendered this impossible,     (p. 089)\r\nand throughout succeeding years this aspect of electoral reform\r\nyielded precedence to other matters.[125]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 125: _Annual Register_ (1905), 193.]\r\n\r\nA special difficulty inherent in the subject is imposed by the\r\npeculiar situation of Ireland. By reason of the decline of Ireland's\r\npopulation during the past half century that portion of the United\r\nKingdom has come to be markedly over-represented at Westminster. The\r\naverage Irish commoner sits for but 44,147 people, while the average\r\nEnglish member represents 66,971. If a new distribution were to be\r\nmade in strict proportion to members Ireland would lose 30 seats and\r\nWales three, while Scotland would gain one and England about 30. It is\r\ncontended by the Irish people, however, that the Act of Union of 1800,\r\nwhereby Ireland was guaranteed as many as one hundred parliamentary\r\nseats, is in the nature of a treaty, whose stipulations cannot be\r\nviolated save by the consent of both contracting parties; and so long\r\nas the Irish are not allowed a separate parliament they may be\r\ndepended upon to resist, as they did resist in 1905, any proposal\r\ncontemplating the reduction of their voting strength in the parliament\r\nof the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n*93. The Problem of the Plural Vote.*--Aside from the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen, the principal suffrage questions in Great Britain to-day are\r\nthose pertaining to the conferring of the voting privilege upon adult\r\nmales who are still debarred, the abolition of the plural vote, and a\r\ngeneral simplification and unification of franchise arrangements. The\r\nproblem of the plural vote is an old one. Under existing law an\r\nelector may not vote more than once in a single constituency, nor in\r\nmore than one division of the same borough; but aside from this, and\r\nexcept in so far as is not prohibited by residence requirements, he is\r\nentitled to vote in every constituency in which he possesses a\r\nqualification. In the United States and in the majority of European\r\ncountries a man is possessed of but one vote, and any arrangement\r\nother than this would seem to contravene the principle of civic\r\nequality which lies at the root of popular government. In England\r\nthere have been repeated attempts to bring about the establishment of\r\nan unvarying rule of \"one man, one vote,\" but never as yet with\r\nsuccess. The number of plural voters--some 525,000--is relatively\r\nsmall, but when it is remembered that a single voter may cast during a\r\nparliamentary election as many as fifteen or twenty votes it will be\r\nobserved that the number quite suffices to turn the scale in many\r\nclosely contested constituencies. An overwhelming proportion of the\r\nplural voters are identified with the Conservative party, whence it\r\narises that the Liberals are, and long have been, hostile to the\r\nprivilege. Following the Liberal triumph at the elections of 1906  (p. 090)\r\na Plural Voting Bill was introduced requiring that every elector\r\npossessed of more than one vote should be registered in the\r\nconstituency of his choice and in no other one. The measure passed the\r\nCommons, by a vote of 333 to 104, but the Conservative majority in the\r\nLords compassed its defeat, alleging that while it was willing to\r\nconsider a complete scheme of electoral reform the proposed bill was\r\nnot of such character.[126]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 126: May and Holland, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, III., 48-49. It may be noted\r\n                   that an able royal commission, appointed in\r\n                   December, 1908, to study foreign electoral systems\r\n                   and to recommend modifications of the English\r\n                   system, reported in 1910 adversely to the early\r\n                   adoption of any form of proportional\r\n                   representation.]\r\n\r\n*94. The Franchise Bill of 1912.*--Soon after the final enactment, in\r\nAugust, 1911, of the Parliament Bill whereby the complete ascendancy\r\nof the Commons was secured in both finance and legislation[127] the\r\nLiberal government of Mr. Asquith made known its intention to bring\r\nforward at an early date a comprehensive measure of franchise reform.\r\nDuring the winter of 1911-1912 the project was formulated, and in the\r\nearly summer of 1912 the bill was introduced. The adoption of the\r\nmeasure in its essentials is not improbable, although at the date of\r\nwriting[128] it is by no means assured. In the main, the bill makes\r\nprovision for three reforms. In the first place, it substitutes for\r\nthe present complicated and illogical network of suffrages a simple\r\nresidential or occupational qualification, thereby extending the\r\nvoting privilege to practically all adult males. In the second place,\r\nit simplifies the process of registration and, in effect, enfranchises\r\nlarge numbers of men who in the past have been unable to vote because\r\nof change of residence or of the difficulties of the registration\r\nprocess. Finally, it abolishes absolutely both the plural vote and the\r\nseparate representation of the universities. The effect of the first\r\ntwo of these provisions, it is estimated, would be to enlarge the\r\nelectorate by 2,500,000 votes, that of the third, to reduce it by\r\nupwards of 600,000;[129] so that the net result of the three would be\r\nto raise an existing electorate of eight millions to one of ten\r\nmillions. A total of twenty-eight franchise statutes are totally, and\r\nforty-four others are partially, repealed by the bill. The ground upon\r\nwhich the measure, in its earlier stages, was attacked principally was\r\nits lack of provision for a redistribution of seats. The defense of\r\nthe Government has been that, while the imperative need of\r\nredistribution is recognized, such redistribution can be effected only\r\nafter it shall be known precisely what the franchise arrangements  (p. 091)\r\nof the kingdom are to be.[130]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 127: See pp. 110-113.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 128: October, 1912.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 129: The number of plural voters is\r\n                   placed at 525,000; that of graduates who elect the\r\n                   university representatives, at 49,614.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 130: A timely volume is J. King and F. W.\r\n                   Raffety, Our Electoral System; the Demand for\r\n                   Reform (London, 1912).]\r\n\r\n*95. The Question of Woman's Suffrage.*--It will be observed that the\r\nFranchise Bill restricts the franchise to adult males. The measure was\r\nshaped deliberately, however, to permit the incorporation of an\r\namendment providing for the enfranchisement of women. It is a fact not\r\nfamiliarly known that English women of requisite qualifications were\r\nat one time in possession of the suffrage at national elections. They\r\nwere not themselves allowed to vote, but a woman was privileged to\r\npass on her qualifications temporarily to any man, and, prior to the\r\nseventeenth century, the privilege was occasionally exercised. It was\r\nnot indeed, until the Reform Act of 1832 that the law of elections, by\r\nintroducing the phrase \"male persons,\" in effect vested the\r\nparliamentary franchise exclusively in men.[131] The first notable\r\nattempt made in Parliament to restore and extend the female franchise\r\nwas that of John Stuart Mill in 1867. His proposed amendment to the\r\nreform bill of that year was defeated by a vote of 196 to 73. In 1870\r\na woman's suffrage measure drafted by Dr. Pankhurst and introduced in\r\nthe Commons by John Bright passed its second reading by a majority of\r\nthirty-three, but was subsequently rejected. During the seventies and\r\nearly eighties a vigorous propaganda was maintained and almost every\r\nsession produced its crop of woman's suffrage bills. A determined\r\nattempt was made to secure the inclusion of a woman's suffrage clause\r\nin the Reform Bill of 1884. The proposed amendment was supported very\r\ngenerally by the press, but in consequence of a threat by Gladstone to\r\nthe effect that if the amendment were carried the entire measure would\r\nbe withdrawn the project was abandoned. The next chapter of importance\r\nin the history of the movement was inaugurated by the organization, in\r\n1903, of the Women's Social and Political Union. In 1904 a suffrage\r\nbill was introduced but failed to become law. Within the past decade,\r\nhowever, the cause has made substantial headway, and by the\r\nspectacular character which it has assumed it has attracted wide\r\nattention. In March, 1912, a Woman's Enfranchisement measure was\r\nrejected in the House of Commons by the narrow margin of 222 to 208\r\nvotes. Premier Asquith is opposed to female enfranchisement, but his\r\ncolleagues in the ministry are almost evenly divided upon the issue,\r\nand it is not inconceivable that a woman's suffrage measure may be\r\ncarried through in the guise of an amendment to the pending Franchise\r\nBill. If it were to be, and the qualifications should be made      (p. 092)\r\nidentical with those of men, the number of women voters would be\r\napproximately 10,500,000.[132]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 131: May and Holland, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, III., 61.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 132: K. Schirmacher, The Modern Woman's\r\n                   Rights Movement, trans. by C. C. Eckhardt (New\r\n                   York, 1912), 58-96; B.

Qualifications for Election.*--The regulations governing the\r\nqualifications essential for election to Parliament are to-day, on the\r\nwhole, simple and liberal. The qualification of residence was replaced\r\nin the eighteenth century by a property qualification; but, as has\r\nbeen pointed out, in 1858 this likewise was swept away. Oaths of\r\nallegiance and oaths imposing religious tests once operated to debar\r\nmany, but all that is now required of a member is a very simple oath\r\nor affirmation of allegiance, in a form compatible with any shade of\r\nreligious belief or unbelief. Any male British subject who is of age\r\nis qualified for election, unless he belongs to one of a few small\r\ngroups--notably peers (except Irish); clergy of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, the Church of England, and the Church of Scotland; certain\r\noffice-holders; bankrupts; and persons convicted of treason, felony,\r\nor corrupt practices. A member is not required to be a resident of the\r\nelectoral district which he represents. Once elected, a man properly\r\nqualified cannot escape membership by resignation. He may be expelled,\r\nbut the only means by which he can retire from the House voluntarily\r\nis the acceptance of some public post whose occupant is _ipso facto_\r\ndisqualified. To serve this end two or three sinecures are maintained,\r\nthe best known being the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. The\r\nmember who desires to give up his seat accomplishes his purpose by\r\napplying for one of these offices, receiving it, and after having\r\ndisqualified himself, resigning it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ELECTORAL PROCEDURE AND REGULATIONS\r\n\r\n*97. Writs and Election Days.*--When a parliament is dissolved the royal\r\nproclamation wherein the dissolution is declared expresses the desire\r\nof the crown to have the advice of the people and announces the\r\nsovereign's will and pleasure to call a new parliament. With this\r\nproclamation as a warrant, the chancellors of Great Britain and\r\nIreland forthwith issue writs of election, addressed to the returning\r\nofficers of the counties and boroughs, i.e., in all Scotch and Irish\r\nconstituencies and in the English counties the sheriffs, or their\r\ndeputies, and in the English boroughs the mayors. The form of these\r\nwrits, as well as the nature of the electoral procedure generally, is\r\nprescribed in the Parliamentary and Municipal Elections Act, commonly\r\nknown as the Ballot Act, of 1872.[133] Upon receipt of the proper  (p. 093)\r\nwrit the returning officer gives notice of the day and place of the\r\nelection, and of the poll if it is known that the election will be\r\ncontested. In the counties the election must take place within nine\r\ndays, in the boroughs within four days, after receipt of the writ, but\r\nwithin these limits the date is fixed in each constituency by the\r\nreturning officer. What actually happens on election day is: (1) all\r\ncandidates for seats are placed formally in nomination; (2) if within\r\nan hour of the time fixed for the election the number of nominated\r\ncandidates does not exceed the number of places to be filled, the\r\nelection of these candidates is forthwith declared; and (3) if there\r\nis a contest the election is postponed to a polling day, to be fixed\r\nby the returning officer, in the counties from two to six, and in the\r\nboroughs not more than three, days distant.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 133: For the form of the writ see Anson,\r\n                   Law and Custom of the Constitution, I., 57.]\r\n\r\n*98. The Polling.*--Prior to 1872 candidates were nominated _viva voce_\r\nat the \"hustings,\" an outdoor platform erected for the purpose; but\r\nnowadays nominations are made in writing. It is required that a\r\ncandidate shall be proposed by a registered elector of the\r\nconstituency and that his nomination shall be assented to formally by\r\nnine other electors. The number of uncontested elections is invariably\r\nlarge (especially in Ireland, where, in many instances, it is useless\r\nto oppose a candidate to the Nationalists), the proportion reaching\r\nsometimes one-fourth, and even one-third. Polling is completed within\r\nan individual constituency during the course of a single day, the\r\nhours being from eight o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in\r\nthe evening, but under the arrangements that have been described it\r\nfalls out that a national election is extended invariably through a\r\nperiod of more than two weeks. The system operates, of course, to the\r\nadvantage of the plural voter, who is enabled to present himself at\r\nthe polls from day to day in widely separated constituencies. For the\r\nconvenience of voters constituencies are divided regularly into\r\ndistricts, or precincts. When the properly qualified and registered\r\nelector appears at the polls a ballot paper is presented to him\r\ncontaining the names of the candidates. He takes this to a screened\r\ncompartment and places a cross-mark opposite the name or names of\r\nthose for whom he desires to vote, after which the paper is deposited\r\nin a box. At the conclusion of the polling, the boxes are transmitted\r\nto the returning officer of the constituency, the votes are counted,\r\nand the result is declared. The writ which served as the returning\r\nofficer's authority is indorsed with a certificate of the election and\r\nreturned to the clerk of the Crown in Chancery. It is to be observed,\r\nhowever, that in the universities the Ballot Act does not apply. In\r\nthese constituencies an elector may deliver his vote orally, or    (p. 094)\r\nhe may transmit it by proxy from his place of residence.[134]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 134: On electoral procedure see Lowell,\r\n                   Government of England, I., Chap. 10; M.

Frequency of Elections: the Campaign.*--General elections do not\r\ntake place in Great Britain with periodic regularity. The only\r\npositive requirement in the matter is that an election must be ordered\r\nwhen a parliament has attained the maximum lifetime allowed it by law.\r\nPrior to 1694 there was no stipulation upon this subject and the king\r\ncould keep a parliament in existence as long as he liked. Charles II.\r\nretained for seventeen years the parliament called at his accession.\r\nFrom 1694 to 1716, however, the maximum term of a parliament was three\r\nyears; from 1716 to 1911 it was seven years; to-day it is five\r\nyears.[135] In point of fact, parliaments never last through the\r\nmaximum period, and an average interval of three or four years between\r\nelections has been the rule. In most instances an election is\r\nprecipitated more or less unexpectedly on an appeal to the country by\r\na defeated ministry, and it not infrequently happens that an election\r\nturns all but completely upon a single issue and thus assumes the\r\ncharacter of a national referendum upon the subject in hand. This was\r\npre-eminently true of the last general election, that of December,\r\n1910, at which the country was asked to sustain the Asquith government\r\nin its purpose to curb the independent authority of the House of\r\nLords. In any event, the campaign by which the election is preceded is\r\nbrief, although it continues throughout the electoral period, and, if\r\nthe outcome is doubtful, tends to increase rather than to diminish in\r\nintensity. Appeals to the voters are made principally through public\r\nspeaking, the controversial and illustrated press, the circulation of\r\npamphlets and handbills, parades and mass-meetings, and the generous\r\nuse of placards, cartoons, and other devices designed to attract and\r\nfocus attention. Plans are laid, arguments are formulated, and     (p. 095)\r\nleadership in public appeal is assumed by the members of the\r\nGovernment, led by the premier, and, on the other side, by the men who\r\nare the recognized leaders of the parliamentary Opposition.[136]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 135: The Representation of the People Act\r\n                   of 1867 made the duration of a parliament\r\n                   independent of a demise of the crown.

The Regulation of Electoral Expenditure.*--Time was, and within\r\nthe memory of men still living, when an English parliamentary election\r\nwas attended by corrupt practices so universal and so shameless as to\r\nappear almost more ludicrous than culpable. Voters as a matter of\r\ncourse accepted the bribes that were tendered them and ate and drank\r\nand smoked and rollicked at the candidate's expense throughout the\r\nelectoral period and were considered men of conscience indeed if they\r\ndid not end by going over to the opposition. The notorious Northampton\r\nelection of 1768, in the course of which a body of voters numbering\r\nunder a thousand were the recipients of hospitalities from the backers\r\nof three candidates which aggregated upwards of a million pounds, was,\r\nof course, exceptional; but the history of countless other cases\r\ndiffered from it only in the amounts laid out. To-day an altogether\r\ndifferent state of things obtains. From having been one of the most\r\ncorrupt, Great Britain has become one of the most exemplary of nations\r\nin all that pertains to the proprieties of electoral procedure. The\r\nBallot Act of 1872 contained provisions calculated to strengthen\r\npre-existing corrupt practices acts, but the real turning point was\r\nthe adoption of the comprehensive Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of\r\n1883. By this measure bribery (in seven enumerated forms) and treating\r\nwere made punishable by imprisonment or fine and, under varying\r\nconditions, political disqualification. The number and functions of\r\nthe persons who may be employed by the candidate to assist in a\r\ncampaign were prescribed, every candidate being required to have a\r\nsingle authorized agent charged with the disbursement of all moneys\r\n(save certain specified \"personal\" expenditures) in the candidate's\r\nbehalf and with the duty of submitting to the returning officer within\r\nthirty-five days after the election a sworn statement covering all\r\nreceipts and expenditures. And, finally, the act fixed, upon a sliding\r\nscale in proportion to the size of the constituencies, the maximum\r\namounts which candidates may legitimately expend. In boroughs\r\ncontaining not more than 2,000 registered voters the amount is     (p. 096)\r\n£350, with an additional £30 for every thousand voters above the\r\nnumber mentioned. In rural constituencies, where proper outlays will\r\nnormally be larger, the sum of £650 is allowed when the number of\r\nregistered electors falls under 2,000, with £60 for each additional\r\nthousand. Beyond these sums the candidate is allowed an outlay of £100\r\nfor expenses of a purely personal character.\r\n\r\nThe range of expenditure which is thus permitted by law is, of course,\r\nconsiderable, and the records of election cases brought into the\r\ncourts demonstrate that not infrequently in practice its limits are\r\nexceeded. None the less, the effect of the law has been undeniably to\r\nrestrain the outpouring of money by candidates, to purify politics,\r\nand at the same time to enable men of moderate means to stand for\r\nelection who otherwise would be at grave disadvantage as against their\r\nwealthier and more lavish competitors. It is of interest to observe\r\nthat by reason of the non-participation of the state in electoral\r\ncosts there fall upon candidates certain charges which are unknown in\r\nthe United States and other countries. The bills submitted by the\r\nreturning officer must be paid by the candidates within the\r\nconstituency, and these bills cover the publishing of notices of the\r\nelection, the preparing and supplying of nomination papers, the cost\r\nof dies, ballot-paper, polling-stations, and printing, the fees of\r\nclerks, and, finally, the travelling expenses and fee of the returning\r\nofficer himself. The candidate's share of this outlay may be as small\r\nas £25, but it is likely to be from £200 to £300 and may rise to as\r\nmuch as £600.[137]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 137: On the adoption of the Corrupt and\r\n                   Illegal Practices Act of 1883 see May and Holland,\r\n                   Constitutional History of England, III., 31-33. The\r\n                   actual operation of the system established may be\r\n                   illustrated by citing a specific case. At the\r\n                   election of 1906 the maximum expenditure legally\r\n                   possible for Mr. Lloyd-George in his sparsely\r\n                   populated Carnarvon constituency was £470. His\r\n                   authorized agent, after the election, reported an\r\n                   outlay of £50 on agents, £27 on clerks and\r\n                   messengers, £189 on printing, postage, etc., £30 on\r\n                   public meetings, £25 on committee rooms, and £40 on\r\n                   miscellaneous matters--a total of £361. The\r\n                   candidate's personal expenditure amounted to £92,\r\n                   so that the total outlay of £462 fell short by a\r\n                   scant £8 of the sum that might legally have been\r\n                   laid out. Divided among the 3,221 votes that Mr.\r\n                   Lloyd-George received, his outlay per vote was 2s.,\r\n                   10d. At the same election Mr. Asquith's expenditure\r\n                   was £727; Mr. Winston Churchill's, £844; Mr. John\r\n                   Morley's, £479; Mr. Keir Hardie's, £623; Mr. James\r\n                   Bryce's, £480. In non-contested constituencies\r\n                   expenditures are small. In 1906 Mr. Redmond's was\r\n                   reported to be £25 and Mr. William O'Brien's, £20.\r\n                   In 1900 a total of 1,103 candidates for 670 seats\r\n                   expended £777,429 in getting 3,579,345 votes; in\r\n                   1906, 1,273 candidates for the same 670 seats\r\n                   expended £1,166,858 in getting 5,645,104 votes; in\r\n                   January, 1910, 1,311 candidates laid out £1,296,382\r\n                   in getting 6,667,394 votes.

COMPOSITION\r\n\r\n*101. Origins.*--With the possible exception of the Hungarian Table of\r\nMagnates, the British House of Lords is the most ancient second\r\nchamber among parliamentary bodies. It is, furthermore, among second\r\nchambers the largest and the most purely hereditary. Its descent can\r\nbe traced directly from the Great Council of the Plantagenet period\r\nand, in the opinion of some scholars, from the witenagemot of\r\nAnglo-Saxon times.[138] To the Council belonged originally the\r\nnobility, and the clergy, greater and lesser. Practically, the body\r\nwas composed of the more influential churchmen and the more powerful\r\ntenants-in-chief of the crown. In the course of time the lesser clergy\r\nfound it convenient to confine their attention to the proceedings of\r\nthe ecclesiastical assemblage known as Convocation; while the lesser\r\nnobles, i.e., the poorer and more uninfluential ones, found it to\r\ntheir interest to cast in their lot, not as formerly with the great\r\nbarons and earls, but with the well-to-do though non-noble knights of\r\nthe shire. From the elements that remained--the higher clergy and the\r\ngreater nobles--developed directly the House of Lords. The lesser\r\nbarons, the knights of the shire, and the burgesses, on the other\r\nhand, combined to form the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 138: \"The House of Lords not only springs\r\n                   out of, it actually is, the ancient Witenagemot. I\r\n                   can see no break between the two.\" Freeman, Growth\r\n                   of the English Constitution, 62. Professor Freeman,\r\n                   it must be remembered, was prone to glorify\r\n                   Anglo-Saxon institutions and to under-estimate the\r\n                   changes that were introduced in England through the\r\n                   agency of the Norman Conquest. For the most recent\r\n                   statement of the opposing view see Adams, Origin of\r\n                   the English Constitution, Chaps. 1-4.]\r\n\r\n*102. Princes of the Blood and Hereditary Peers.*--In respect to its\r\nfundamental constitution the House of Lords has undergone but slight\r\nmodification during the many centuries of its existence. In respect,\r\nhowever, to the composition and size of the body changes have been\r\nnumerous and important. There are in the chamber to-day at least six\r\ndistinct groups of members, sitting by various rights and possessing\r\na status which is by no means identical. The first comprises       (p. 098)\r\nprinces of the royal blood who are of age. The number of these is\r\nvariable, but of course never large. They take precedence of the other\r\nnobility, but in point of fact seldom participate in the proceedings\r\nof the Chamber. The second group is the most important of all. It\r\ncomprises the peers with hereditary seats and is itself divided\r\nproperly into three groups: the peers of England created before the\r\nunion with Scotland in 1707, the peers of Great Britain created\r\nbetween the date mentioned and the union with Ireland in 1801, and the\r\npeers of the United Kingdom created since that date. Technically,\r\npeers are created by the crown; but in practice their creation is\r\ncontrolled largely by the premier; and the act may be performed for\r\nthe purpose of honoring men of distinction in law, letters, science,\r\nor business, or for the more practical purpose of altering the\r\npolitical complexion of the upper chamber.[139] The power to create\r\npeerages is unlimited[140] and, this being the only means by which the\r\nmembership of the body can be increased at discretion, the power is\r\none which is not infrequently exercised. Originally the right to sit\r\nas a peer was conferred simply by an individual writ of summons, or by\r\nthe fact that such a writ had been issued to one's ancestor, but this\r\nmethod has long since been replaced by a formal grant of letters\r\npatent, accompanied by bestowal of the requisite writ. With exceptions\r\nto be noted, peerages are hereditary, and the heir assumes his\r\nparliamentary seat at the age of twenty-one. Peers are of five\r\nranks--dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. The complicated\r\nrules governing the precedence of these classes are of large social,\r\nbut of minor political, interest.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 139: The first peerage bestowed purely in\r\n                   recognition of literary distinction was that of\r\n                   Lord Tennyson in 1884, the peerages bestowed upon\r\n                   Macaulay and Bulwer Lytton having been determined\r\n                   upon in part under the influence of political\r\n                   considerations. The first professional artist to be\r\n                   honored with a peerage was Lord Leighton, in 1896.\r\n                   Lord Kelvin and Lord Lister are among well-known\r\n                   men of science who have been so honored. Lord\r\n                   Goschen's viscountcy was conferred, with universal\r\n                   approval, as the fitting reward of a great business\r\n                   career. The earldom of General Roberts and the\r\n                   viscountcies of Generals Wolseley and Kitchener\r\n                   were bestowed in recognition of military\r\n                   distinction. With some aptness the House of Lords\r\n                   has been denominated \"the Westminster Abbey of\r\n                   living celebrities.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 140: Except that, under existing law, the\r\n                   crown cannot (1) create a peer of Scotland, (2)\r\n                   create a peer of Ireland otherwise than as allowed\r\n                   by the Act of Union with Ireland, and (3) direct\r\n                   the devolution of a dignity otherwise than in\r\n                   accordance with limitations applying in the case of\r\n                   grants of real estate.]\r\n\r\n*103. Representative Peers of Scotland and of Ireland.*--A third group\r\nof members comprises the representative peers of Scotland. Under\r\nprovision of the Act of Union of 1707, when a new parliament is\r\nsummoned the whole body of Scottish peers elects sixteen of their\r\nnumber to sit as their representatives at Westminster. By custom   (p. 099)\r\nthe election takes place at Holyrood Palace in the city of\r\nEdinburgh.[141] The act of 1707 made no provision for the creation of\r\nScottish peers, with the consequence that, through the extinction of\r\nnoble families and the occasional conferring of a peerage of the\r\nUnited Kingdom upon a Scottish peer, the total number of Scottish\r\npeerages has been reduced from 165 to 33.[142] The tenure of a\r\nScottish representative peer at Westminster expires with the\r\ntermination of a parliament. A fourth group of members is the Irish.\r\nBy the Act of Union of 1800 it was provided that not all of the peers\r\nof Ireland should be accorded seats in the House of Lords, but only\r\ntwenty-eight of them, to be elected for life by the whole number of\r\nIrish peers. The number of Irish peerages was put in the course of\r\ngradual reduction and it is now under the prescribed maximum of one\r\nhundred.[143] Unlike the English and Scottish peers, Irish peers, if\r\nnot elected to the House of Lords, may stand for election to the House\r\nof Commons, though they may not represent Irish constituencies.[144]\r\nWhile members of the Commons, however, they may not be elected to the\r\nLords, nor may they participate in the choice of representative peers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 141: For a statement of the process of\r\n                   election see Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution (4th ed.), I., 219-229.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 142: In 1909. Lowell, Government of\r\n                   England, I., 395.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 143: The crown was authorized to create\r\n                   one Irish peerage only for every three such\r\n                   peerages that should become extinct. During the\r\n                   thirty years preceding the conferring of an Irish\r\n                   peerage upon Mr. Curzon, in 1898, the creation of\r\n                   Irish peerages was entirely suspended.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 144: Lord Palmerston, for example, was an\r\n                   Irish peer, but sat in the House of Commons.]\r\n\r\n*104. The Lords of Appeal.*--A fifth group of members comprises the\r\nLords of Appeal in Ordinary, who differ from other peers created by\r\nthe crown in that their seats are not hereditary. One of the functions\r\nof the House of Lords is to serve as the highest national court of\r\nappeal. It is but logical that there should be included within the\r\nmembership of the body a certain number of the most eminent jurists of\r\nthe realm, and, further, that the judicial business of the chamber\r\nshould be transacted largely by this corps of experts. In 1876 an\r\nAppellate Jurisdiction Act was passed authorizing the appointment of\r\ntwo (subsequently increased to four) \"law lords\" with the title of\r\nbaron, and by legislation of 1887 the tenure of these members,\r\nhitherto conditioned upon the continued exercise of judicial\r\nfunctions, was made perpetual for life. At the present day these four\r\njustices, presided over by the Lord Chancellor, comprise in reality\r\nthe supreme tribunal of the kingdom. Three of them are sufficient to\r\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of judicial business, and  (p. 100)\r\nalthough other legal-minded members of the chamber may participate,\r\nand technically every member has a right to do so, in most instances\r\nthis inner circle discharges the judicial function quite alone.[145]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 145: The recognized advisability of\r\n                   strengthening the judicial element in the Lords\r\n                   precipitated at one time a serious issue respecting\r\n                   the power of the crown to create life peerages. In\r\n                   1856, upon the advice of her ministers, Queen\r\n                   Victoria conferred upon a distinguished judge, Sir\r\n                   James Parke, a patent as Baron Wensleydale for\r\n                   life. The purpose was to introduce into the chamber\r\n                   desirable legal talent without further augmenting\r\n                   the peerage. For the creation of life peerages\r\n                   there was some precedent, but none later than the\r\n                   reign of Henry VI., and the House of Lords,\r\n                   maintaining that the right had lapsed and that the\r\n                   peerage had become entirely hereditary, refused to\r\n                   admit Baron Wensleydale until his patent was so\r\n                   modified that his peerage was made hereditary.]\r\n\r\n*105. The Lords Spiritual.*--Finally, there are the ecclesiastical\r\nmembers--not peers, but \"lords spiritual.\" In the fifteenth century\r\nthe lords spiritual outnumbered the lords temporal; but upon the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII., resulting\r\nin the dropping out of the abbots, the spiritual contingent fell\r\npermanently into the minority. At the present day the quota of\r\necclesiastical members is restricted, under statutory regulation, to\r\n26. Scotland, whose established church is the Presbyterian, has none.\r\nBetween 1801 and 1869 Ireland had four, but since the disestablishment\r\nof the Irish church in 1869 there have been none. In England five\r\necclesiastics, by statute, are entitled invariably to seats, i.e.,\r\nthe archbishops of Canterbury and York and the bishops of London,\r\nDurham, and Winchester. Among the remaining bishops the law allows\r\nseats to twenty-one, in the order of seniority. There are always,\r\ntherefore, some English bishops--in 1909, ten--who are not members of\r\nthe chamber.[146] All ecclesiastical members retain their seats during\r\ntenure of their several sees, but do not, of course, transmit their\r\nrights to their heirs, nor, necessarily, save in the case of the five\r\nmentioned, to their successors in office. Bishops and archbishops are\r\nelected, nominally, by the dean and chapter of the diocese; but when a\r\nvacancy arises the sovereign transmits a _congé d'élire_ containing\r\nthe name of the person to be elected, so that, practically,\r\nappointment is made by the crown, acting under the advice of the prime\r\nminister. Bishoprics are created by act of Parliament.[147]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 146: The Bishop of Sodor and Man is\r\n                   entitled to a seat, but not to take part in the\r\n                   chamber's proceedings. His status has been compared\r\n                   to that of a territorial delegate in the United\r\n                   States.

Qualifications and Number of Members.*--A peer may be        (p. 101)\r\nprevented from occupying a seat in the chamber by any one of several\r\ndisqualifications. He must have attained the age of twenty-one; he\r\nmust not be an alien; he must not be a bankrupt; he must not be under\r\nsentence for felony. On the other hand, a man who inherits a peerage\r\ncannot renounce the inheritance. Upon more than one occasion this rule\r\nhas been a matter of political consequence, for its operation has\r\nsometimes meant that an able and ambitious commoner has been compelled\r\nto surrender his seat in the more important chamber and to assume a\r\nwholly undesired place in the upper house. In 1895 Mr. William W.\r\nPalmer, later Lord Selbourne, inheriting a peerage but desiring to\r\ncontinue for a time in the Commons, put this rule to a definite test\r\nby neglecting to apply for a writ of summons as a peer. The decision\r\nof the Commons, however, was that he was obligated to accept\r\nmembership in the upper chamber, and hence to yield the place which he\r\noccupied in the lower.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords numbers to-day 620 members. In earlier periods of\r\nits history it was a very much smaller body, and, indeed, its most\r\nnotable growth has taken place within the past one hundred and fifty\r\nyears. During the reign of Henry VII. there were never more than\r\neighty members, the majority of whom were ecclesiastics. To the first\r\nparliament of Charles II. there were summoned 139 persons. At the\r\ndeath of William III. the roll of the upper chamber comprised 192\r\nnames. At the death of Queen Anne the number was 209: at that of\r\nGeorge I. it was 216; at that of George II., 229; at that of George\r\nIII., 339; at that of George IV., 396; at that of William IV., 456.\r\nBetween 1830 and 1898 there were conferred 364 peerages--222 under\r\nLiberal ministries (covering, in the aggregate, forty years) and 142\r\nunder the Conservatives (covering twenty-seven years). More than\r\none-half of the peerages of to-day have been created within the past\r\nfifty years, and of the remainder only an insignificant proportion can\r\nbe termed ancient.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE REFORM OF THE LORDS: THE QUESTION PRIOR TO 1909\r\n\r\n*107. The Status of the Chamber.*--As a law-making body the House of\r\nLords antedates the House of Commons. At the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century the theory was that the magnates assented to\r\nlegislation while the Commons merely petitioned for it. In a statute\r\nof 1322, however, the legislative character of Parliament as a     (p. 102)\r\nwhole was effectively recognized, and at the same time the legislative\r\nparity of the commons with the magnates. Thenceforth, until very\r\nnearly the present day, the two chambers were legally co-ordinate and\r\nevery act of legislation required the assent of both. It is true that\r\nduring the course of the nineteenth century there was a remarkable\r\ngrowth of legislative preponderance on the part of the House of\r\nCommons, until, indeed, the point was reached where all important\r\nmeasures were first presented in that chamber and the Lords were very\r\ncertain not to thwart the ultimate adoption of any project of which\r\nthe nation as represented in the popular branch unmistakably approved.\r\nYet upon numerous occasions bills, and sometimes--as in the case of\r\nGladstone's Home Rule Bill in 1893--highly important ones, were\r\ndefeated outright; and at all times the chamber imposed a check upon\r\nthe lower house and exercised a powerful influence upon the actual\r\ncourse of legislative business. Under the provisions of the act of\r\n1911, however, the status and the legislative functions of the House\r\nof Lords have been profoundly altered, and an adequate understanding\r\nof the workings of the British parliament to-day requires some review\r\nof the changes wrought by that remarkable piece of legislation.\r\n\r\nThroughout upwards of a century the \"mending or ending\" of the Lords\r\nhas been among the most widely discussed of public issues in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The question has been principally one of \"mending,\"\r\nfor the number of persons who have advocated seriously the total\r\nabolition of the chamber has been small and their influence has been\r\nslight. The utility of a second chamber, in a democratic no less than\r\nin an illiberal constitutional system, is very generally\r\nadmitted,[148] and no one supposes that the House of Lords will ever\r\nbe swept completely out of existence to make room for the\r\nestablishment of a new and entirely different parliamentary body. If\r\nit were to devolve upon the people of Great Britain to-day to adopt\r\nfor themselves _de novo_ a complete governmental system, they might\r\nwell not incorporate in that system an institution of the nature of\r\nthe present House of Lords; but since the chamber exists and is rooted\r\nin centuries of national usage and tradition, the perpetuation of it,\r\nin some form, may be taken to be assured.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 148: There are, of course, Englishmen who\r\n                   concur in the dictum of Sieyès that \"if a second\r\n                   chamber dissents from the first, it is mischievous;\r\n                   if it agrees, it is superfluous.\" An able exponent\r\n                   of this doctrine, within recent years, is Sir\r\n                   Charles Dilke.]\r\n\r\n*108. The Breach Between the Lords and the Nation.*--The indictments\r\nwhich have been brought against the House of Lords have been sweeping\r\nand varied. They have been based upon the all but exclusively\r\nhereditary character of the membership, upon the meagerness of     (p. 103)\r\nattendance at the sittings and the small interest displayed by a\r\nmajority of the members, and upon the hurried and frequently\r\nperfunctory nature of the consideration which is accorded public\r\nmeasures. Fundamentally, however, the tremendous attack which has been\r\nlevelled against the Lords has had as its impetus the conviction of\r\nlarge masses of people that the chamber as constituted stands\r\npersistently and deliberately for interests which are not those of the\r\nnation at large. Prior to the parliamentary reforms of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the House of Commons was hardly more representative of the\r\npeople than was the upper chamber. Both were controlled by the landed\r\naristocracy, and between the two there was as a rule substantial\r\naccord. After 1832, however, the territorial interests, while yet\r\npowerful, were not dominant in the Commons, and a cleavage between the\r\nLords, on the one hand, and the Commons, increasingly representative\r\nof the mass of the nation, on the other, became a serious factor in\r\nthe politics and government of the realm. The reform measures of 1867\r\nand 1884, establishing in substance a system of manhood suffrage in\r\nparliamentary elections, converted the House of Commons into an organ\r\nof thoroughgoing democracy. The development of the cabinet system\r\nbrought the working executive, likewise, within the power of the\r\npeople to control. But the House of Lords underwent no corresponding\r\ntransformation. It remained, and still is, an inherently and\r\nnecessarily conservative body, representative, in the main, of the\r\ninterests of landed property, adverse to changes which seem to menace\r\nproperty and established order, and identified with all the forces\r\nthat tend to perpetuate the nobility and the Anglican Church as\r\npillars of the state. By simply standing still while the remaining\r\ndepartments of the governmental system were undergoing democratization\r\nthe second chamber became, in effect, a political anomaly.[149]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 149: Dickinson, Development of Parliament\r\n                   during the Nineteenth Century, Chap. 3.]\r\n\r\n*109. Earlier Projects of Reform.*--Projects for the reform of the Lords\r\nwere not unknown before 1832, but it has been since that date, and,\r\nmore particularly during the past half-century, that the reform\r\nquestion has been agitated most vigorously. Some of the notable\r\nproposals that have been made relate to the composition of the\r\nchamber, others to the powers and functions of it, and still others to\r\nboth of these things. In respect to the composition of the body, the\r\nsuggestions that have been brought forward have contemplated most\r\ncommonly the reduction of the chamber's size, the dropping out of the\r\necclesiastical members, and the substitution, wholly or in part, of\r\nspecially designated members in the stead of the members who at present\r\nsit by hereditary right. As early as 1834 it was advocated that    (p. 104)\r\nthe archbishops and bishops of the Established Church should \"be\r\nrelieved from their legislative and judicial duties,\" and this demand,\r\narising principally from the Non-conformists, has been voiced\r\nrepeatedly in later years. In 1835 the opposition of the peers to\r\nmeasures passed by the Commons incited a storm of popular disapproval\r\nof such proportions that more than one of the members of the chamber\r\ngloomily predicted the early demolition of the body, and throughout\r\nsucceeding decades the idea took increasing hold, within the\r\nmembership as well as without, that change was inevitable. In 1869 a\r\nbill of Lord Russell providing for the gradual infiltration of life\r\npeers was defeated on the third reading, and in the same year a\r\nproject of Earl Grey, and in 1874 proposals of Lord Rosebery and Lord\r\nInchiquin, came to naught. The rejection by the Lords of measures\r\nsupported by Gladstone's government in 1881-1883 brought the chamber\r\nafresh into popular disfavor, and in 1884 Lord Rosebery introduced a\r\nmotion \"that a select committee be appointed to consider the best\r\nmeans of promoting the efficiency of this House,\" with the thought\r\nthat there might be brought into the chamber representatives of the\r\nnation at large, and even of the laboring classes. The motion was\r\nrejected overwhelmingly, but in 1888 it was renewed, and in that year\r\nthe Salisbury government introduced two reform bills, one providing\r\nfor the gradual creation of fifty life peerages, to be conferred upon\r\nmen of attainment in law, diplomacy, and administrative service, and\r\nthe other (popularly known as the \"Black Sheep Bill\") providing for\r\nthe discontinuance of writs of summons to undesirable members of the\r\npeerage. The bills, however, were withdrawn after their second reading\r\nand an attempt on the part of Lord Carnarvon, in 1889, to revive the\r\nsecond of them failed.\r\n\r\n*110. The Lords and the Liberal Government, 1906-1907.*--Thence-forward\r\nuntil 1907 the issue was largely quiescent. During a considerable\r\nportion of this period the Unionist party was in power, and between\r\nthe upper chamber, four-fifths of whose members were Unionists, and\r\nthe Unionist majority in the Commons substantial harmony was easily\r\nmaintained. During the Liberal administration of 1893-1894 the Lords\r\nrejected Gladstone's second Home Rule Bill and mutilated and defeated\r\nother measures; but, although the Liberal leaders urged that the will\r\nof the people had been frustrated, the appeal for second chamber\r\nreform failed utterly to strike fire. With the establishment of the\r\nCampbell-Bannerman ministry, in December, 1905, the Liberals entered\r\nupon what has proved a prolonged tenure of power and the issue of the\r\nLords was brought again inevitably into the forefront of public\r\ncontroversy. In consequence of the Lords' insistence upon an amendment\r\nof the fundamentals of the Government's Education Bill, late in    (p. 105)\r\n1906, and the openly manifested disposition of the Unionist upper chamber\r\nto obstruct the Liberal programme in a variety of directions,[150] the\r\nwarfare between the houses once more assumed threatening proportions.\r\nA resolution introduced by the premier June 24, 1907, was adopted in\r\nthe Commons after a three days' debate by a vote of 385 to 100, as\r\nfollows: \"That, in order to give effect to the will of the people as\r\nexpressed by elected representatives it is necessary that the power of\r\nthe other House to alter or reject bills passed by this House shall be\r\nso restricted by law as to secure that within the limits of a single\r\nparliament the final decision of the Commons shall prevail.\" It was\r\nannounced that a bill carrying into effect the substance of this\r\ndeclaration would be introduced, and it was understood that the\r\nGovernment's plan contemplated a reduction of the maximum life of a\r\nparliament from seven years to five and the institution of a system of\r\nconference committees whereby agreement might be effected upon\r\noccasion between the two houses, reserving the eventual right of the\r\nCommons, after a third rejection by the Lords, to enact a measure into\r\nlaw alone. Preoccupied, however, with projects of general legislation,\r\nthe Government postponed and eventually abandoned the introduction of\r\nits bill.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 150: Notably in respect to legislation\r\n                   abolishing the plural vote and regulating the\r\n                   liquor traffic. The Lords rejected a Plural Voting\r\n                   Bill and an Aliens Bill in 1906, a Land Values Bill\r\n                   in 1907, and a Licensing Bill in 1908. In the\r\n                   interest of accuracy it should be observed that\r\n                   during the first session of 1906 a total of 121\r\n                   bills became law, that only four (including the\r\n                   Education Bill) passed by the Commons were rejected\r\n                   by the Lords, and that fifteen passed by the Lords\r\n                   were rejected in the Commons. The proportions at\r\n                   most sessions during the period under review were\r\n                   substantially similar. But, of course, measures\r\n                   rejected by the Lords were likely to be those in\r\n                   which the interest of the Liberal government was\r\n                   chiefly centered.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper chamber a measure introduced by Lord Newton, providing\r\nfor (1) a reduction of the hereditary element by requiring that a peer\r\nby descent alone should have a right to sit only if he were elected\r\n(for a single parliament) as a representative peer or possessed other\r\nstipulated qualifications and (2) the appointment by the crown of a\r\nmaximum of one hundred life peers, was discussed at some length. The\r\nbill was withdrawn, but it was decided to create a Select Committee on\r\nthe House of Lords, under the chairmanship of Lord Rosebery, and in\r\nDecember, 1908, this committee reported a scheme of reform in\r\naccordance with which (1) a peerage alone should not entitle the\r\nholder to a seat in the chamber; (2) the hereditary peers, including\r\nthose of Scotland and Ireland, should elect two hundred representatives\r\nto sit in the upper house for each parliament; (3) hereditary peers\r\nwho had occupied certain posts of eminence in the government and the\r\narmy and navy should be entitled to sit without election; (4) the  (p. 106)\r\nbishops should elect eight representatives, while the archbishops\r\nshould sit as of right; and (5) the crown should be empowered to\r\nsummon four life peers annually, so long as the total did not exceed\r\nforty. This series of proposals failed utterly to meet the Liberal\r\ndemand and no action was taken upon it. But it is to be noted that the\r\nLords' Reconstruction Bill of 1911, to be described presently, was\r\nbased in no small measure upon information and recommendations\r\nforthcoming from the Rosebery committee.[151]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 151: May and Holland, Constitutional\r\n                   History of England, III., 343-349. For references\r\n                   on the general subject of the reform of the Lords\r\n                   see pp. 115-116.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE QUESTION OF THE LORDS, 1909-1911\r\n\r\n*111. The Lords and Money Bills.*--In November, 1909, the issue was\r\nreopened in an unexpected manner by the Lords' rejection of the\r\nGovernment's Finance Bill, in which were included far-reaching\r\nproposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd-George,\r\nrespecting the readjustment of national taxation. This act of the\r\nupper chamber, while not contrary to positive law, contravened in so\r\nserious a manner long established custom that it was declared by those\r\nwho opposed it to be in effect revolutionary. Certainly the result was\r\nto precipitate an alteration of first-rate importance in the\r\nconstitution of the kingdom. The priority of the Commons within the\r\ndomain of finance was established at an early period of parliamentary\r\nhistory; and priority, in time, was converted into thoroughgoing\r\ndominance. As early as 1407 Henry IV. recognized the principle that\r\nmoney grants should be initiated in the Commons, assented to by the\r\nLords, and subsequently reported to the crown. This procedure was not\r\nalways observed, but after the resumption by the two houses of their\r\nnormal functions following the Restoration in 1660 the right of the\r\ncommoners to take precedence in fiscal business was forcefully and\r\ncontinuously asserted. In 1671 the Commons resolved \"that in all aids\r\ngiven to the king by the Commons, the rate or tax ought not to be\r\naltered by the Lords,\" and a resolution of 1678 reaffirmed that all\r\nbills granting supplies \"ought to begin with the Commons.\" At no time\r\ndid the Lords admit formally the validity of these principles; but, by\r\nrefusing to consider fiscal measures originated in the upper chamber\r\nand to accept financial amendments there proposed, the Commons\r\nsuccessfully enforced observance of them.\r\n\r\nThe rules in this connection upon which the Commons insisted have been\r\nsummarized as follows: (1) The Lords ought not to initiate any     (p. 107)\r\nlegislative proposal embodied in a public bill and imposing a charge\r\non the people, whether by taxes, rates, or otherwise, or regulating\r\nthe administration or application of money raised by such a charge,\r\nand (2) the Lords ought not to amend any such legislative proposal by\r\naltering the amount of a charge, or its incidence, duration, mode of\r\nassessment, levy or collection, or the administration or application\r\nof money raised by such a charge.[152] These rules, although not\r\nembodied in any law or standing order, were through centuries so\r\ngenerally observed in the usage of the two houses that they became for\r\nall practical purposes, a part of the constitutional system--conventional,\r\nit is true, but none the less binding. From their observance it\r\nresulted (1) that the upper chamber was never consulted about the\r\nannual estimates, about the amounts of money to be raised, or about\r\nthe purposes to which those amounts should be appropriated; (2) that\r\nproposals of taxation came before it only in matured form and under\r\ncircumstances which discouraged criticism; and (3) that, since the\r\npolicy of the executive is controlled largely through the medium of\r\nthe power of the purse, the upper house lost entirely the means of\r\nexercising such control. In 1860 the Lords, as has been mentioned,\r\nmade bold to reject a bill for the repeal of the duties on paper; but\r\nthe occasion was seized by the Commons to pass a resolution\r\nreaffirming vigorously the subordination of the second chamber in\r\nfinance, and the next year the repeal of the paper duties was\r\nincorporated in the annual budget and forced through. Thereafter it\r\nbecame the invariable practice to give place to all proposals of\r\ntaxation in the one grand Finance Bill of the year, with the effect,\r\nof course, of depriving the Lords of the opportunity to defeat a\r\nproposal of the kind save by rejecting the whole of the measure of\r\nwhich it formed a part.[153]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 152: Ilbert, Parliament, 205.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 153: It was in pursuance of this policy\r\n                   that Sir William Vernon-Harcourt incorporated in\r\n                   the Finance Bill of 1894, extensive changes in the\r\n                   death duties and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, in 1899,\r\n                   included proposals for altering the permanent\r\n                   provisions made for the reduction of the national\r\n                   debt.]\r\n\r\n*112. The Finance Bill of 1909 and the Asquith Resolutions.*--The\r\nrejection of the Finance Bill in 1909,[154] following as it did the\r\nrejection of other important measures which the Liberal majority in\r\nthe Commons had approved, raised in an acute form the question of the\r\npower of the Lords over money bills and precipitated a crisis in   (p. 108)\r\nthe relations between the two houses. On the one hand the House of\r\nCommons adopted, by a vote of 349 to 134, a memorable resolution to\r\nthe effect that \"the action of the House of Lords in refusing to pass\r\ninto law the provision made by the House of Commons for the finances\r\nof the year is a breach of the constitution, and a usurpation of the\r\nprivileges of the House of Commons\"; and, on the other, the Asquith\r\nministry came instantly to the decision that the situation demanded an\r\nappeal to the country. In January, 1910, a general election took\r\nplace, with the result that the Government was continued in power,\r\nthough with a reduced majority; and at the convening of the new\r\nparliament, in February, the Speech from the Throne promised that\r\nproposals should speedily be submitted \"to define the relations\r\nbetween the houses of Parliament, so as to secure the undivided\r\nauthority of the House of Commons over finance, and its predominance\r\nin legislation.\" The Finance Bill of the year was reintroduced and\r\nthis time successfully carried through; but in advance of its\r\nreappearance the premier laid before the House of Commons a series of\r\nresolutions to the following effect:[155] (1) that the House of Lords\r\nshould be disabled by law from rejecting or amending a money bill; (2)\r\nthat the power of the chamber to veto other bills should be restricted\r\nby law; and (3) that the duration of a parliament should be limited to\r\na maximum period of five years. During the course of the debate upon\r\nthese resolutions it was made clear that the Government did not desire\r\nthe abolition of the Lords, but wished merely to have the legislative\r\ncompetence of the house confined to consultation, revision, and,\r\nsubject to proper safeguards, delay. April 14, 1910, the resolutions\r\nwere adopted in the Commons by substantial majorities,[156] and with\r\nthem as a basis the Government proceeded with the framing of its bill\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 154: Strictly, the Lords declined to\r\n                   assent to the Budget until it should have been\r\n                   submitted to the judgment of the people. On the\r\n                   nature of the Government's finance proposals see\r\n                   May and Holland, Constitutional History of England,\r\n                   III., 350-355; G. L. Fox, The British Budget of\r\n                   1909, in _Yale Review_, Feb., 1910; and D.\r\n                   Lloyd-George, The People's Budget (London, 1909),\r\n                   containing extracts from the Chancellor's speeches\r\n                   on the subject.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 155: The Finance Bill passed its third\r\n                   reading in the House of Commons April 27, was\r\n                   passed in the Lords April 28, without division, and\r\n                   received the royal assent April 29.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 156: The votes on the three resolutions\r\n                   were, respectively, 339 to 237, 351 to 246, and 334\r\n                   to 236.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, March 14, there had been introduced in the House of Lords\r\nby Lord Rosebery an independent series of resolutions, as follows: (1)\r\nthat a strong and efficient second chamber is not merely a part of the\r\nBritish constitution but is necessary to the well-being of the state\r\nand the balance of Parliament; (2) that such a chamber may best be\r\nobtained by the reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords; and\r\n(3) that a necessary preliminary to such a reform and reconstitution\r\nis the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a peerage\r\nshould no longer of itself involve the right to sit and vote in    (p. 109)\r\nthe House. The first two of these resolutions were agreed to without\r\ndivision; the third, although vigorously opposed, was carried\r\neventually by a vote of 175 to 17.\r\n\r\n*113. The Unionists and the Referendum.*--The death of the king, May 6,\r\nhalted consideration of the subject, and through the succeeding summer\r\nhope was centered in a \"constitutional conference\" participated in by\r\neight representatives of the two houses and of the two principal\r\nparties. A total of twenty-one meetings were held, but all effort to\r\nreach an agreement proved futile and at the reassembling of\r\nParliament, November 15, the problem was thrown back for solution upon\r\nthe houses and the country. November 17 there was carried in the\r\nLords, without division, a new resolution introduced by Lord Rosebery\r\nto the effect that in future the House of Lords should consist of\r\nLords of Parliament in part chosen by the whole body of hereditary\r\npeers from among themselves and by nomination of the crown, in part\r\nsitting by virtue of offices held and qualifications possessed, and in\r\npart designated from outside the ranks of the peerage. A few days\r\nsubsequently, the Government's Parliament Bill having been presented\r\nin the second chamber (November 21), Lord Lansdowne, leader of the\r\nOpposition in that chamber, came forward with a fresh series of\r\nresolutions designed to clarify the Unionist position in anticipation\r\nof the elections which were announced for the ensuing month. With\r\nrespect to money bills it was declared that the Lords were \"prepared\r\nto forego their constitutional right to reject or amend money bills\r\nwhich are purely financial in character,\" provided that adequate\r\nprovision should be made against tacking, that questions as to whether\r\na bill or any provision thereof were purely financial should be\r\nreferred to a joint committee of the two houses (the Speaker of the\r\nCommons presiding and possessing a casting vote), and that a bill\r\ndecided by such a committee to be not purely financial should be dealt\r\nwith in a joint sitting of the two houses. With respect to all\r\nmeasures other than those thus provided for the resolutions declared\r\nthat \"if a difference arises between the two houses with regard to any\r\nbill other than a money bill in two successive sessions, and with an\r\ninterval of not less than one year, and such difference cannot be\r\nadjusted by any other means, it shall be settled in a joint sitting\r\ncomposed of members of the two houses; provided that if the difference\r\nrelates to a matter which is of great gravity, and has not been\r\nadequately submitted for the judgment of the people, it shall not be\r\nreferred to the joint sitting, but shall be submitted for decision to\r\nthe electors by referendum.\" It will be observed that these resolutions\r\nwere hardly less drastic than were those carried through the       (p. 110)\r\nCommons by the ministry. Their adoption involved the abolition of the\r\nabsolute veto of the second chamber and might well involve the\r\nintrusting of interests which the peers held dear to the hazards of a\r\nnation-wide referendum.[157] None the less, the resolutions were\r\nagreed to without division, and, both parties having in effect\r\npronounced the existing legislative system unsatisfactory, the\r\nelectorate was asked to choose between the two elaborate substitutes\r\nthus proposed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 157: For the growth of the idea of the\r\n                   referendum see H. W. Horwill, The Referendum in\r\n                   Great Britain, in _Political Science Quarterly_,\r\n                   Sept., 1911.]\r\n\r\n*114. The Enactment of the Parliament Bill, 1911.*--The appeal to the\r\ncountry, in December, yielded results all but exactly identical with\r\nthose of the elections of the previous January. The Government secured\r\na majority of 127, and in the new parliament, which met February 6,\r\nthe Parliament Bill was reintroduced without alteration. On the ground\r\nthat the measure had been submitted specifically to the people and had\r\nbeen approved by them, the ministry demanded its early enactment by\r\nthe two houses. May 15 the bill passed its third reading in the\r\nCommons by a vote of 362 to 241. During the committee stage upwards of\r\none thousand amendments were suggested. But the Government stood firm\r\nfor the instrument as originally drawn and, while it accepted a few\r\nincidental changes, in the end it got essentially its own way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, early in May, Lord Lansdowne introduced in the upper\r\nchamber a comprehensive bill which put in form for legislation the\r\nprogramme of reconstruction to which the more moderate elements in\r\nthat chamber were ready, under the circumstances, to subscribe. The\r\nLansdowne Reconstruction Bill proposed, at the outset, a reduction of\r\nthe membership of the chamber to 350. Princes of the blood and the two\r\narchbishops should retain membership, but the number of bishops entitled\r\nto sit should be reduced to five, these to be chosen triennially by\r\nthe whole body of higher prelates upon the principle of proportional\r\nrepresentation. The remainder of the membership should comprise lords\r\nof parliament, as follows: (1) 100 elected from the peers possessing\r\ncarefully stipulated qualifications, for a term of twelve years, on\r\nthe principle of proportional representation, by the whole body of\r\nhereditary peers (including the Scotch and Irish), one-fourth of the\r\nnumber retiring triennially; (2) 120 members chosen by electoral colleges\r\ncomposed of members of the House of Commons divided for the purpose\r\ninto local groups, each returning from three to twelve, under conditions\r\nof tenure similar to those prevailing in the first class; and (3) 100\r\nappointed, from the peerage or outside, by the crown on nomination by\r\nthe premier, with regard to the strength of parties in the House   (p. 111)\r\nof Commons, and under the before-mentioned conditions of tenure. It\r\nwas stipulated, further, that peers not sitting in the House of Lords\r\nshould be eligible for election to the House of Commons, and that,\r\nexcept in event of the \"indispensable\" elevation of a cabinet minister\r\nor ex-minister to the peerage, it should be unlawful for the crown to\r\nconfer the dignity of an hereditary peerage upon more than five\r\npersons during the course of any single year.\r\n\r\nThis body of proposals, it will be observed, related exclusively to\r\nthe _composition_ of the upper chamber. The Liberal leaders preferred\r\nto approach the problem from the other side and to assure the\r\npreponderance of the Commons by the imposition of positive\r\nrestrictions upon the _powers_ which the Lords, under given\r\nconditions, might exercise. Lord Lansdowne's bill--sadly characterized\r\nby its author as the \"deathblow to the House of Lords, as many of us\r\nhave known it for so long\"--came too late, and the chamber, after\r\nallowing it to be read a second time without division, was constrained\r\nto drop it for the Government's measure. July 20 the Parliament Bill,\r\namended in such a manner as to exclude from its operation legislation\r\naffecting the constitution and other matters of \"great gravity,\" was\r\nadopted without division. The proposed amendments were highly\r\nobjectionable to the Liberals and, relying upon an understanding\r\nentered into with the king during the previous November relative to\r\nthe creation of peers favorable to the Government's programme, the\r\nministry let it be understood that no compromise upon essentials could\r\nbe considered.[158] Confronted with the prospect of a wholesale\r\n\"swamping,\"[159] the Opposition fell back upon the policy of\r\nabstention and, although a considerable number of \"last-ditchers\" held\r\nout to the end, a group of Unionists adequate to carry the measure\r\njoined the supporters of the Government, August 10, in a vote not to\r\ninsist upon the Lords' amendments, which meant, in effect, to approve\r\nthe bill as adopted in the lower house.[160] The royal assent was\r\nextended August 18.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 158: When, July 24, Premier Asquith rose\r\n                   in the Commons to reply to the Lords' amendments\r\n                   there resulted such confusion that for the first\r\n                   time in generations, save upon one occasion in\r\n                   1905, the Speaker was obliged to adjourn a sitting\r\n                   on account of the disorderly conduct of members.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 159: Had the Unionists maintained to the\r\n                   end their attitude of opposition the number of\r\n                   peers which would have had to be created to ensure\r\n                   the enactment of the bill would have been some\r\n                   400.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 160: The final vote in the Lords was 131\r\n                   to 114. The Unionist peers who voted with the\r\n                   Government numbered 37.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PARLIAMENT ACT OF 1911 AND AFTER                           (p. 112)\r\n\r\n*115. Provisions Relating to Money Bills.*--In its preamble the\r\nParliament Act promises further legislation which will define both the\r\ncomposition and the powers of a second chamber \"constituted on a\r\npopular instead of an hereditary basis\"; but the act itself relates\r\nexclusively to the powers of the chamber as it is at present\r\nconstituted. The general purport of the measure is to define the\r\nconditions under which, while the normal methods of legislation remain\r\nunchanged, financial bills and proposals of general legislation may\r\nnevertheless be enacted into law without the concurrence of the upper\r\nhouse. The first signal provision is that a public bill passed by the\r\nHouse of Commons and certified by the Speaker to be, within the terms\r\nof the act, a \"money bill\" shall, unless the Commons direct to the\r\ncontrary, become an act of Parliament on the royal assent being\r\nsignified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords may not have\r\nconsented to the bill, within one month after it shall have been sent\r\nup to that house. A money bill is defined as \"a public bill which, in\r\nthe judgment of the Speaker, contains only provisions dealing with all\r\nor any of the following subjects: the imposition, repeal, remission,\r\nalteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment\r\nof debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated\r\nFund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal\r\nof any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody,\r\nissue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee\r\nof any loan or the payment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental\r\nto those subjects or any of them.\" A certificate of the Speaker given\r\nunder this act is made conclusive for all purposes. It may not be\r\nquestioned in any court of law.[161]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 161: An incidental effect of the act is\r\n                   to exalt the power and importance of the Speaker,\r\n                   although it should be observed that the Speaker has\r\n                   long been accustomed to state at the introduction\r\n                   of a public bill whether in his judgment the rights\r\n                   or privileges claimed by the House of Commons in\r\n                   respect to finance had been infringed. If he were\r\n                   of the opinion that there had been infringement, it\r\n                   remained for the House to determine whether it\r\n                   would insist upon or waive its privilege Ilbert,\r\n                   Parliament, 207.]\r\n\r\n*116. Provisions Relating to Other Public Bills.*--The second\r\nfundamental stipulation is that any other public bill (except one to\r\nconfirm a provisional order or one to extend the maximum duration of\r\nParliament beyond five years) which is passed by the House of Commons\r\nin three successive sessions, whether or not of the same parliament,\r\nand which, having been sent up to the House of Lords at least one  (p. 113)\r\nmonth, in each case, before the end of the session, is rejected by\r\nthat chamber in each of those sessions, shall, unless the House of\r\nCommons direct to the contrary, become an act of Parliament on the\r\nroyal assent being signified thereto, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe House of Lords has not consented to the bill. It is required that\r\nat least two years shall have elapsed between the date of the second\r\nreading of such a bill (i.e., the first real opportunity for its\r\ndiscussion) in the first of these sessions of the House of Commons and\r\nthe final passage of the bill in the third of the sessions. To come\r\nwithin the provisions of this act the measure must be, at its initial\r\nand its final appearances, the \"same bill;\" that is, it must exhibit\r\nno alterations save such as are rendered necessary by the lapse of\r\ntime. And a bill is to be construed to be \"rejected\" by the Lords if\r\nit is not passed, or if amendments are introduced to which the House\r\nof Commons does not agree, or which the House of Commons does not\r\nsuggest to the House of Lords at the second or third passage of the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n*117. Effects of the Act.*--By the provisions which have been enumerated\r\nthe co-ordinate and independent position which, in law if not in fact,\r\nthe British upper chamber, as a legislative body, has occupied through\r\nthe centuries has been effectually subverted. Within the domain of\r\nlegislation, it is true, the Lords may yet exercise influence of no\r\ninconsiderable moment. To the chamber must be submitted every project\r\nof finance and of legislation which it is proposed to enact into law,\r\nand there is still nothing save a certain measure of custom to prevent\r\nthe introduction of even the most important of non-financial measures\r\nfirst of all in that house. But a single presentation of any money\r\nbill fulfills the legal requirement and ensures that the measure will\r\nbecome law. For such a bill will not be presented until it has been\r\npassed by the Commons, and, emanating from the cabinet, it will not be\r\nintroduced in that chamber until the assent of the executive is\r\nassured. The upper house is allowed one month in which to approve or\r\nto reject, but, so far as the enactment of the bill is concerned, the\r\nresult is the same in any case. Upon ordinary legislation the House of\r\nLords possesses still a veto--a veto, however, which is no longer\r\nabsolute but only suspensive. The conditions which are required for\r\nthe enactment of non-fiscal legislation without the concurrence of the\r\nLords are not easy to bring about, but their realization is not at all\r\nan impossibility. By the repeated rejection of proposed measures the\r\nLords may influence public sentiment or bring about otherwise a change\r\nof circumstances and thus compass the defeat of the original intent of\r\nthe Commons, and this is the more possible since a minimum period of\r\ntwo years is required to elapse before a non-fiscal measure can be (p. 114)\r\ncarried over the Lords' veto. But the continuity of political\r\nalignments and of legislative policy is normally such in Great Britain\r\nthat the remarkable legislative precedence which has been accorded the\r\nCommons must mean in effect little less than absolute law-making\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n*118. Possible Further Changes and the Difficulties Involved.*--What the\r\nfuture holds in store for the House of Lords cannot be discerned. The\r\nParliament Act, as has been pointed out, promises further legislation\r\nwhich will define both the composition and the powers of a second\r\nchamber constituted on a popular instead of an hereditary basis; but\r\nno steps have as yet (1912) been taken publicly in this direction, nor\r\nhas any authoritative announcement of purpose been made.[162] Many\r\nEnglishmen to-day are of the opinion that, as John Bright declared, \"a\r\nhereditary House of Lords is not and cannot be perpetual in a free\r\ncountry.\" None the less, it is recognized that the chamber as it is at\r\npresent constituted contains a large number of conscientious, eminent,\r\nand able men, that upon numerous occasions the body has imposed a\r\nwholesome check upon the popular branch, and that sometimes it has\r\ninterpreted the will of the nation more correctly than has the popular\r\nbranch itself. The most reasonable programme of reform would seem to\r\nbe, not a total reconstitution of the chamber upon a non-hereditary\r\nbasis, but (1) the adoption of the Rosebery principle that the\r\npossession of a peerage shall not of itself entitle the possessor to\r\nsit, (2) the admission to membership of a considerable number of\r\npersons representative of the whole body of peers, and (3) the\r\nintroduction of a goodly quota of life peers, appointed by reason of\r\nlegal attainments, governmental experience, and other qualities of\r\nfitness and eminence.[163]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 162: The Parliament Act is the handiwork,\r\n                   of course, of the Liberal party, and only that\r\n                   party is likely to acknowledge the obligation to\r\n                   follow up the reform of the Lords which the measure\r\n                   imposes. But the Unionists may be regarded as\r\n                   committed by Lord Lansdowne's bill to some measure\r\n                   of popularization of the chamber.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 163: During the discussions of 1910 an\r\n                   interesting suggestion was offered (April 25) by\r\n                   Lord Wemyss to the effect that the representative\r\n                   character of the chamber should be given emphasis\r\n                   by the admission of three members designated by\r\n                   each of some twenty-one commercial, professional,\r\n                   and educational societies of the kingdom, such as\r\n                   the Royal Academy of Arts, the Society of\r\n                   Engineers, the Shipping Federation, and the Royal\r\n                   Institute of British Architects.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that neither this programme nor any\r\nother that can be offered, unless it be that of popular election,\r\naffords much ground upon which to hope for harmonious relations\r\nbetween the upper chamber and a Liberal Government. The House of\r\nLords--_any_ House of Lords in which members sit for life or in\r\nheredity--is inevitably conservative in its political tendencies   (p. 115)\r\nand sympathies, which means, as conditions are to-day, that the\r\nchamber is certain to be dominated by adherents of the Unionist party.\r\nHistory shows that even men who are appointed to the upper house as\r\nLiberals become adherents almost invariably, in time, of Unionism. The\r\nconsequence is that, while a Unionist administration is certain to\r\nhave the support of a working majority in both of the houses, a\r\nLiberal government cannot expect ever to find itself in the ascendancy\r\nin the Lords. Its measures will be easy to carry in the lower house\r\nbut difficult or impossible to carry in the upper one. This was the\r\ncentral fact in the situation from which sprang the Parliament Act of\r\n1911. By this piece of legislation the Liberals sought to provide for\r\nthemselves a mode of escape from the _impasse_ in which the opposition\r\nof the Lords so frequently has involved them. The extent, however, to\r\nwhich the arrangements effected will fulfill the purpose for which\r\nthey were intended remains to be ascertained.[164] \"An upper house in\r\na true parliamentary system,\" says Lowell, \"cannot be brought into\r\nconstant accord with the dominant party of the day without destroying\r\nits independence altogether; and to make the House of Lords a mere\r\ntool in the hands of every cabinet would be well-nigh impossible and\r\npolitically absurd.\"[165] Therein must be adjudged still to lie    (p. 116)\r\nthe essential dilemma of English politics.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 164: The literature of the question of\r\n                   second chamber reform in England is voluminous and\r\n                   but a few of the more important titles can be\r\n                   mentioned here.

THE ASSEMBLING OF THE CHAMBERS\r\n\r\n*119. Sessions.*--Parliament is required by statute to meet at least\r\nonce in three years;[166] but, by reason of the enormous pressure of\r\nbusiness and, in particular, the custom which forbids the voting of\r\nsupplies for a period longer than one year, meetings are, in point of\r\nfact, annual. A session begins ordinarily near the first of February\r\nand continues, with brief adjournments at holiday seasons, until\r\nAugust or September. It is required that the two houses shall\r\ninvariably be summoned together. Either may adjourn without the other,\r\nand the crown can compel an adjournment of neither. A prorogation,\r\nwhich brings a session to a close, and a dissolution, which brings the\r\nexistence of a parliament to an end, must be ordered for the two\r\nhouses conjointly. Both take place technically at the command of the\r\ncrown, actually upon the decision of the ministry. A prorogation is to\r\na specified date, and it terminates all pending business; but the\r\nreassembling of the houses may be either postponed or hastened by\r\nroyal proclamation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 166: Triennial Act of December 22, 1694.]\r\n\r\n*120. The Opening of a Parliament.*--At the beginning of a session the\r\nmembers of the two houses gather first of all in their respective\r\nchambers. The commoners are summoned thereupon to the chamber of the\r\nLords, where the letters patent authorizing the session are read and\r\nthe Lord Chancellor makes known the desire of the crown that the\r\nCommons proceed with the choosing of a Speaker. The Commons withdraw\r\nto attend to this matter, and on the next day the newly elected\r\nofficial, accompanied by the members, presents himself at the bar of\r\nthe House of Lords, announces his election, and, through the Lord\r\nChancellor, receives the royal approbation. Having demanded and\r\nreceived guarantee of the \"ancient and undoubted rights and privileges\r\nof the Commons,\" the Speaker and the members then retire to their own\r\nquarters, where the necessary oaths are administered. If, as is not\r\nunusual, the king meets Parliament in person, he goes in state,    (p. 118)\r\nprobably the next day, to the House of Lords and takes his seat upon\r\nthe throne, and the Lord Chamberlain is instructed to desire the\r\nGentleman Usher of the Black Rod to _command_ the attendance once more\r\nof the Commons. If the sovereign does not attend, the Lords\r\nCommissioners bid the Usher to _desire_ the Commons' presence. In any\r\ncase, the commoners present themselves and the king (or, in his\r\nabsence, the Lord Chancellor) reads the Speech from the Throne, in\r\nwhich is communicated succinctly the nature of the business to which\r\nattention is to be directed. Following the retirement of the\r\nsovereign, the Commons again withdraw, the Throne Speech is reread and\r\nan address in reply voted in each house, and the Government begins the\r\nintroduction of fiscal and legislative proposals. In the event that a\r\nsession is not the first one of a parliament, the election of a\r\nSpeaker and the administration of oaths are omitted.[167]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 167: On the ceremonies involved in the\r\n                   opening, adjournment, prorogation, and dissolution\r\n                   of a parliament see Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, I., 61-77; J.

The Palace of Westminster.*--From the beginning of parliamentary\r\nhistory the meeting-place of the houses has been regularly\r\nWestminster, on the left bank of the Thames. The last parliament which\r\nsat at any other spot was the third Oxford Parliament of Charles II.,\r\nin 1681. The Palace of Westminster, in mediæval times outside, though\r\nnear, the principal city of the kingdom, was long the most important\r\nof the royal residences, and it was natural that its great halls and\r\nchambers, together with the adjoining abbey, should be utilized\r\nhabitually for parliamentary sittings. Of the enormous structure known\r\nas Westminster to-day (still, technically, a royal palace, though not\r\na royal residence), practically all portions save old Westminster Hall\r\nwere constructed after the fire of 1834. The Lords first occupied\r\ntheir present quarters in 1847 and the Commons theirs in 1850.[168]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 168: MacDonaugh, The Book of Parliament,\r\n                   79-95; Graham, The Mother of Parliaments, 60-80;\r\n                   Wright and Smith, Parliament, Past and Present, I.,\r\n                   Chaps. 11-13.

Britton,\r\n                   History of the Ancient Palace and Late Houses of\r\n                   Parliament at Westminster (London, 1836).]\r\n\r\n*122. The Chambers of the Commons and the Lords.*--From opposite sides\r\nof a central lobby corridors lead to the halls in which the sittings\r\nof the two bodies are held, these halls facing each other in such  (p. 119)\r\na manner that the King's throne at the south end of the House of Lords\r\nis visible from the Speaker's chair at the north end of the House of\r\nCommons. The room occupied by the Commons is not large, being but\r\nseventy-five feet in length by forty-five in breadth. It is bisected\r\nby a broad aisle, at the upper end of which is a large table for the\r\nuse of the clerk and his assistants and beyond this the raised and\r\ncanopied chair of the Speaker. \"Facing the aisle on each side long\r\nrows of high-backed benches, covered with dark green leather, slope\r\nupward tier above tier to the walls of the room; and through them, at\r\nright angles to the aisle, a narrow passage known as the gangway, cuts\r\nacross the House. There is also a gallery running all around the room,\r\nthe part of it facing the Speaker being given up to visitors, while\r\nthe front rows at the opposite end belong to the reporters, and behind\r\nthem there stands, before a still higher gallery, a heavy screen, like\r\nthose erected in Turkish mosques to conceal the presence of women, and\r\nused here for the same purpose.\"[169] The rows of benches on the gallery\r\nsides are reserved for members, but they do not afford a very desirable\r\nlocation and are rarely occupied, save upon occasions of special\r\ninterest. In the body of the house there are fewer than 350 seats for\r\n670 members. As a rule, not even all of these are occupied, for there\r\nare no desks and the member who wishes to read, write, or otherwise\r\noccupy himself seeks the library or other rooms adjoining. The front\r\nbench at the upper end of the aisle, at the right of the Speaker, is\r\nknown as the Treasury Bench and is reserved for members of the\r\nGovernment. The corresponding bench at the Speaker's left is reserved\r\nsimilarly for the leaders of the Opposition. In so far as is possible\r\nin the lack of a definite assignment of seats, members of avowed party\r\nallegiance range themselves behind their leaders, while members of\r\nmore independent attitude seek places below the gangway. \"The accident\r\nthat the House of Commons sits in a narrow room with benches facing\r\neach other, and not, like most continental legislatures, in a      (p. 120)\r\nsemi-circular space, with seats arranged like those of a theatre,\r\nmakes for the two-party system and against groups shading into each\r\nother.\"[170]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 169: Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   249. Visitors, technically \"strangers,\" are present\r\n                   only on sufferance and may be excluded at any time;\r\n                   but the ladies' gallery is not supposed to be\r\n                   within the chamber, so that an order of exclusion\r\n                   does not reach the occupants of it. In the autumn\r\n                   of 1908, however, the disorderly conduct of persons\r\n                   in the ladies' and strangers' galleries caused the\r\n                   Speaker to close these galleries during the\r\n                   remainder of the session. In 1738 the House\r\n                   declared the publication of its proceedings \"a high\r\n                   indignity and a notorious breach of privilege,\"\r\n                   and, technically, such publication is still\r\n                   illegal. In 1771, however, the reporters' gallery\r\n                   was fitted up, and through a century and a quarter\r\n                   the proceedings have been reported and printed as a\r\n                   matter of course.

It contains cross\r\nbenches, but in the main the arrangements that have been described are\r\nduplicated in it. For social and ceremonial purposes there exists\r\namong the members a fixed order of precedence.[171] In the chamber,\r\nhowever, the seating is arranged without regard to this order, save\r\nthat the bishops sit in a group. The Government peers occupy the\r\nbenches on the right of the woolsack and the Opposition those on the\r\nleft, while members who prefer to remain neutral take their places on\r\nthe cross benches between the table and the bar.[172]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 171: This order runs: Prince of Wales,\r\n                   other princes of the royal blood, Archbishop of\r\n                   Canterbury, Lord Chancellor, Archbishop of York,\r\n                   Lord President of the Council, Lord Privy Seal, the\r\n                   dukes, the marquises, the earls, the viscounts, the\r\n                   bishops, and the barons.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 172: For full description, with\r\n                   illustrations, see Wright and Smith, Parliament,\r\n                   Past and Present, Chap. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n*123. Hours of Sittings.*--In the seventeenth century the sittings of\r\nthe Commons began regularly at 8.30 or 9 o'clock in the morning and\r\nterminated with nightfall. In the eighteenth century, and far into the\r\nnineteenth, they were apt to begin as late as 3 or 4 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon and to be prolonged, at least not infrequently, until toward\r\ndaybreak. In 1888, however, a standing order fixed midnight as the\r\nhour for the \"interrupting\" of ordinary business, and in 1906 the hour\r\nwas made 11 o'clock. Nowadays the House meets regularly on Mondays,\r\nTuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 2.45 and continues in session\r\nthroughout the evening, the interval formerly allowed for dinner\r\nhaving been abolished in 1906. On Fridays, set apart, until late in\r\nthe session, for the consideration of private members' bills, the hour\r\nof convening is 12 o'clock. At sittings on days other than Friday the\r\nfirst hour or more is consumed usually with small items of formal\r\nbusiness and with the asking and answering of questions addressed to\r\nthe ministers, so that the public business set for the day is reached\r\nat approximately 4 o'clock.[173]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 173: Redlich, Procedure of the House of\r\n                   Commons, II., 68-77.]\r\n\r\n*124. Officers.*--The principal officers of the House are the      (p. 121)\r\nSpeaker, the Clerk and his two assistants, the Sergeant-at-Arms and\r\nhis deputies, the Chaplain, and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of\r\nWays and Means. The Clerk and the Sergeant-at-Arms, together with\r\ntheir assistants, are appointed for life by the crown, on nomination\r\nof the premier, but the Speaker and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman\r\nof Ways and Means are elected for a single parliament by the House.[174]\r\nAll save the Chairman and his deputy are, strictly, non-political\r\nofficers. The Clerk signs all orders of the House, indorses bills sent\r\nor returned to the Lords, reads whatever is required to be read during\r\nthe sittings, records the proceedings of the chamber, and, with the\r\nconcurrence of the Speaker, supervises the preparation of the official\r\nJournal. The Sergeant-at-Arms attends the Speaker, enforces the\r\nHouse's orders, and presents at the bar of the House persons ordered\r\nor qualified to be so presented. The Chairman of Ways and Means (in\r\nhis absence the Deputy Chairman) presides over the deliberations of\r\nthe House when the body sits as a committee of the whole[175] and\r\nexercises supervision over private bill legislation. Although a\r\npolitical official, he preserves, in both capacities, a strictly\r\nnon-partisan attitude.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 174: In point of fact, the Chairman and\r\n                   Deputy Chairman retire when the ministry by which\r\n                   they have been nominated goes out of office.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 175: On this account he is referred to\r\n                   ordinarily as the Chairman of Committees.]\r\n\r\n*125. The Speakership.*--The speakership arose from the need of the\r\nHouse when it was merely a petitioning body for a recognized\r\nspokesman, and although the known succession of Speakers begins with\r\nSir Thomas Hungerford, who held the office in the last parliament of\r\nEdward III. (1377), there is every reason to suppose that at even an\r\nearlier date there were men whose functions were substantially\r\nequivalent. The Speaker is elected at the beginning of a parliament by\r\nand from the members of the House, and his tenure of office, unless\r\nterminated by resignation or death, continues through the term of that\r\nparliament. The choice of the House is subject to the approval of the\r\ncrown; but, whereas in earlier days the king's will was at this point\r\nvery influential, the last occasion upon which a Speaker-elect was\r\nrejected by the crown was in 1679. Though nominally elected, the\r\nSpeaker is in fact chosen by the ministry, and he is pretty certain to\r\nbe taken, in the first instance, from the party in power. During the\r\nnineteenth century, however, it became customary to re-elect a Speaker\r\nas long as he should be willing to serve, regardless of party\r\naffiliation.\r\n\r\n*126. The Speaker's Functions and Powers.*--The functions of the Speaker\r\nare regulated in part by custom, in part by rules of the House, and\r\nin part by general legislation. They are numerous and, in the      (p. 122)\r\naggregate, highly important. The Speaker is, first of all, the\r\npresiding officer of the House. In this capacity he is a strictly\r\nnon-partisan moderator whose business it is to maintain decorum in\r\ndeliberations, decide points of order, put questions, and announce the\r\nresult of divisions. The non-partisan aspect of the English speakership\r\nsets the office off in sharp contrast with its American counterpart.\r\n\"It makes little difference to any English party in Parliament,\" says\r\nMr. Bryce, \"whether the occupant of the chair has come from their own\r\nor from hostile ranks.... A custom as strong as law forbids him to\r\nrender help to his own side even by private advice. Whatever\r\ninformation as to parliamentary law he may feel free to give must be\r\nequally at the disposal of every member.\"[176] Except in the event of\r\na tie, the Speaker does not vote, even when, the House being in\r\ncommittee, he is not occupying the chair. In the second place, the\r\nSpeaker is the spokesman and representative of the House, whether in\r\ndemanding privileges, communicating resolutions, or issuing warrants.\r\nThere was a time when he was hardly less the spokesman of the king\r\nthan the spokesman of the Commons, but the growth of independence of\r\nthe popular chamber enabled him long ago to cast off this dual and\r\nextremely difficult rôle. The Speaker, furthermore, declares and\r\ninterprets, though he in no case makes, the law of the House. \"Where,\"\r\nsays Ilbert, \"precedents, rulings, and the orders of the House are\r\ninsufficient or uncertain guides, he has to consider what course would\r\nbe most consistent with the usages, traditions, and dignity of the\r\nHouse, and the rights and interests of its members, and on these\r\npoints his advice is usually followed, and his decisions are very\r\nrarely questioned.... For many generations the deference habitually\r\npaid to the occupant of the chair has been the theme of admiring\r\ncomment by foreign observers.\"[177] Finally, the fact should be noted\r\nthat by the Parliament Act of 1911 the Speaker is given sole power,\r\nwhen question arises, to determine whether a given measure is or is\r\nnot to be considered a money bill.[178] Upon his decision may hinge\r\nthe entire policy of the Government respecting a measure, and even the\r\nfate of the measure itself. The Speaker's symbol of authority is the\r\nmace, which is carried before him when he formally enters or leaves\r\nthe House and lies on the table before him when he is in the chair. He\r\nhas an official residence in Westminster, and he receives a salary of\r\n£5,000 a year which is paid from the Consolidated Fund, being on that\r\naccount not subject to change when the annual appropriation bills  (p. 123)\r\nare under consideration. At retirement from office a Speaker is likely\r\nto be pensioned and to be elevated to the peerage.[179]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 176: American Commonwealth, I., 135.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 177: Parliament, 140-141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 178: See p. 112.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 179: On the officers of the House of\r\n                   Commons see Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   Chap. 12; on the speakership, Redlich, Procedure of\r\n                   the House of Commons, II., 131-171; Graham, The\r\n                   Mother of Parliaments, 119-134; MacDonaugh, The\r\n                   Book of Parliament, 115-132; Porritt, Unreformed\r\n                   House of Commons, I., Chaps. 21-22; A.

Mer, Les speakers: étude de la fonction\r\n                   présidentielle en Angleterre et aux États-Unis\r\n                   (Paris, 1910).]\r\n\r\n*127. Quorum.*--As fixed by a resolution of 1640, a quorum for the\r\ntransaction of business in the Commons is forty. If at any time during\r\na sitting the attention of the Speaker is directed to the fact that\r\nthere are not forty members present, the two-minute sand-glass which\r\nstands upon the Clerk's table is inverted and the members are summoned\r\nfrom all portions of the building as for a division. At the close of\r\nthe allotted two minutes the Speaker counts the members present, and\r\nif there be not forty the House adjourns until the time fixed for the\r\nnext regular sitting. Except upon occasions of special interest, the\r\nnumber of members actually occupying the benches is likely to be less\r\nthan two hundred, although most of the remaining members are within\r\nthe building or, in any case, not far distant.\r\n\r\n*128. Kinds of Committees.*--Like all important and numerous legislative\r\nbodies, the House of Commons expedites the transaction of the business\r\nwhich devolves upon it through the employment of committees. As early\r\nas the period of Elizabeth the reference of a bill, after its second\r\nreading, to a select committee was an established practice, and in the\r\nreign of Charles I. it became not uncommon to refer measures to\r\ncommittees of the whole house. The committees of the House to-day may\r\nbe grouped in five categories: (1) the Committee of the Whole; (2)\r\nselect committees on public bills; (3) sessional committees; (4)\r\nstanding committees on public bills; and (5) committees on private\r\nbills. Until 1907 a public bill, after its second reading, went\r\nnormally to the Committee of the Whole; since the date mentioned, it\r\ngoes there only if the House so determines. The Committee of the Whole\r\nis simply the House of Commons, presided over by the Chairman of\r\nCommittees in the place of the Speaker, and acting under rules of\r\nprocedure which permit virtually unrestricted discussion and in other\r\nways lend themselves to the free consideration of the details of a\r\nmeasure. When the subject in hand relates to the providing of revenue\r\nthe body is known, technically, as the Committee of Ways and Means;\r\nwhen to appropriations, it is styled the Committee of the Whole on\r\nSupply, or simply the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n*129. Select and Sessional Committees.*--Select committees         (p. 124)\r\nconsist, as a rule, of fifteen members and are constituted to\r\ninvestigate and report upon specific subjects or measures. It is\r\nthrough them that the House collects evidence, examines witnesses, and\r\notherwise obtains the information required for intelligent\r\nlegislation. After a select committee has fulfilled the immediate\r\npurpose for which it was constituted it passes out of existence. Each\r\nsuch committee chooses its chairman, and each keeps detailed records\r\nof its proceedings, which are included, along with its formal report,\r\nin the published parliamentary papers of the session. The members may\r\nbe elected by the House, but in practice the appointment of some or\r\nall is left to the Committee of Selection, which itself consists of\r\neleven members chosen by the House at the beginning of each session.\r\nThis Committee of Selection, which appoints members not only of select\r\ncommittees but also of standing committees and of committees on\r\nprivate and local bills, is made up after conference between the\r\nleaders of the Government and of the Opposition; and the committees\r\nwhose members it designates are always so constituted that they\r\ncontain a majority favorable to the Government. The number of select\r\ncommittees is, of course, variable, but it is never small. A few are\r\nconstituted for an entire year and are known as sessional committees.\r\nOf these, the Committee of Selection is itself an example; others are\r\nthe Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Public\r\nPetitions.\r\n\r\n*130. Standing Committees.*--Beginning in 1882, certain great standing\r\ncommittees have been created, to the general end that the time of the\r\nHouse may be further economized. Through a change of the standing\r\norders of the chamber effected in 1907 the number of such committees\r\nwas raised from two to four, and all bills except money bills, private\r\nbills, and bills for confirming provisional orders--that is to say,\r\nall public non-fiscal proposals--are required to be referred to one of\r\nthese committees (the Speaker to determine which one) unless the House\r\notherwise directs. It is expected that measures so referred will be so\r\nfully considered in committee that they will consume but little of the\r\ntime of the House. Each of the four committees consists of from sixty\r\nto eighty members, who are named by the Committee of Selection in such\r\na manner that in personnel they will represent faithfully the\r\ncomposition of the House as a whole. One of them, consisting of all\r\nthe representatives of Scotch constituencies and fifteen other\r\nmembers, is constituted with a special view to the transaction of\r\nbusiness relating to Scotland. The chairmen of the four are selected\r\n(from its own ranks) by a \"chairman's panel\" of not more than eight\r\nmembers designated by the Committee of Selection. The procedure    (p. 125)\r\nof the standing committees is closely assimilated to that of the\r\nCommittee of the Whole, and, in truth, they serve essentially as\r\nsubstitutes for the larger body.[180]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 180: On committees on private bills see\r\n                   p. 137. The committees of the House of Commons are\r\n                   described in Lowell, Government of England, I.,\r\n                   Chap. 13; Marriott, English Political Institutions,\r\n                   Chap. 11; Ilbert, Parliament, Chap. 6; Redlich,\r\n                   Procedure of the House of Commons, II., 180-214;\r\n                   and May, Treatise on the Law, Privileges,\r\n                   Proceedings, and Usage of Parliament, Chaps.\r\n                   13-14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\n*131. Sittings and Attendance.*--It is required that the two houses of\r\nParliament shall be convened invariably together, and one may not be\r\nprorogued without the other. The actual sittings of the Lords are,\r\nhowever, very much briefer and more leisurely than are those of the\r\nCommons. Normally the upper chamber meets but four times a week--on\r\nMondays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 4.30 o'clock and on Tuesdays at\r\n5.30. By reason of lack of business or indisposition to consume time\r\nin the consideration of measures whose eventual enactment is assured,\r\nsittings not infrequently are concluded within an hour, although, of\r\ncourse, there are occasions upon which the chamber deliberates\r\nseriously and at much length. A quorum for the transaction of business\r\nis fixed at the number three; although it is but fair to observe\r\nthat if a division occurs upon a bill and it is found that there are\r\nnot thirty members present the question is declared not to be\r\ndecided. Save upon formal occasions and at times when there is under\r\nconsideration a measure in whose fate the members are immediately\r\ninterested, attendance is always meager. There are members who after\r\ncomplying with the formalities incident to the assumption of a seat,\r\nrarely, and in some instances never, reappear among their colleagues.\r\nIt thus comes about that despite the fact that nominally the House of\r\nLords is one of the largest of the world's law-making assemblies, the\r\nchamber exhibits in reality little of the unwieldiness ordinarily\r\ncharacteristic of deliberative bodies of such magnitude. The\r\nefficiency of the chamber is more likely to be impaired by paucity of\r\nattendance than otherwise.\r\n\r\n*132. Officers.*--The officers of the House of Lords are largely\r\nappointive, though in part elective. Except during the trial of a\r\npeer,[181] the presiding official is the Lord Chancellor, appointed by\r\nthe crown on the advice of the premier. The duty of presiding in the\r\nLords, as has been explained, is but one of many that fall to this\r\nremarkable dignitary.[182] If at the time of his appointment an    (p. 126)\r\nincumbent is not a peer he is reasonably certain to be created one,\r\nalthough there is no legal requirement to this effect. The theory is\r\nthat the woolsack which comprises the presiding official's seat is not\r\nwithin the chamber proper[183] and that the official himself, as such,\r\nis not a member of the body. The powers allowed him are not even those\r\ncommonly possessed by a moderator. In the event that two or more peers\r\nrequest the privilege of addressing the chamber, the peers themselves\r\ndecide which shall have the floor. Order in debate is enforced, not by\r\nthe Chancellor, but by the members, and when they speak they address,\r\nnot the chair, but \"My Lords.\" Although, if a peer, the Chancellor may\r\nspeak and vote as any other member, he possesses as presiding officer\r\nno power of the casting vote. In short, the position which the Chancellor\r\noccupies in the chamber is all but purely formal. In addition to\r\n\"deputy speakers,\" designated to preside in the Chancellor's absence,\r\nthe remaining officials of the Lords who owe their positions to\r\ngovernmental appointment are the Clerk of Parliament, who keeps the\r\nrecords; the Sergeant-at-Arms, who attends personally the presiding\r\nofficer and acts as custodian of the mace; and the Gentleman Usher of\r\nthe Black Rod, a pompous dignitary whose function it is to summon the\r\nCommons when their attendance is required and to play a more or less\r\nuseful part upon other ceremonial occasions. The one important\r\nofficial whom the House itself elects is the Lord Chairman of\r\nCommittees, whose duty it is to preside in Committee of the Whole.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 181: See p. 127.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 182: See p. 63.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 183: In the days of Elizabeth the\r\n                   presiding official sat upon a sack actually filled\r\n                   with wool. He sits now, as a matter of fact, upon\r\n                   an ottoman, upholstered in red. But the ancient\r\n                   designation of the seat survives.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSES AND OF MEMBERS\r\n\r\n*133. Nature and Extent of Privileges.*--On the basis in part of custom\r\nand in part of statute there exists a body of definitely established\r\nprivileges, some of which appertain to the Commons as a chamber, some\r\nsimilarly to the Lords, and some to the individual members of both\r\nhouses. The privileges which at the opening of a parliament the\r\nnewly-elected Speaker requests and, as a matter of course, obtains for\r\nthe chamber over which he presides include principally those of\r\nfreedom from arrest, freedom of speech, access to the sovereign, and a\r\n\"favorable construction\" upon the proceedings of the House. Freedom\r\nfrom arrest is enjoyed by members during a session and a period of\r\nforty days before and after it, but it does not protect a member   (p. 127)\r\nfrom the consequences of any indictable offense nor, in civil actions,\r\nfrom any process save arrest. Freedom of speech, finally guaranteed\r\neffectually in the Bill of Rights, means simply that a member may not\r\nbe held to account by legal process outside Parliament for anything he\r\nmay have said in the course of the debates or proceedings of the\r\nchamber to which he belongs. The right of access to the sovereign\r\nbelongs to the Commons collectively through the Speaker, but to the\r\nLords individually. With the growth of parliamentary government both\r\nit and the privilege of \"favorable construction\" have ceased to\r\npossess practical importance. Another privilege which survives is that\r\nof exemption from jury duty, though no longer of refusing to attend\r\ncourt in the capacity of a witness. Each house enjoys the\r\nprivilege--for all practical purposes now the right--of regulating its\r\nown proceedings, of committing persons for contempt, and of deciding\r\ncontested elections. The last-mentioned function the House of Commons,\r\nhowever, has delegated to the courts. A privilege jealously retained\r\nby the Lords is that of trial in all cases of treason or felony by the\r\nupper chamber itself, under the presidency of a Lord High Steward\r\nappointed by the crown. The Lords are exempt from arrest in civil\r\ncauses, not merely during and immediately preceding and succeeding\r\nsessions, but at all times, and they enjoy all the rights, privileges,\r\nand distinctions which, through law or custom, have become inherent in\r\ntheir several dignities.\r\n\r\n*134. Payment of Members of the Commons.*--Until recently the fact that\r\nthere was no salary attached to service in Parliament operated to\r\ndebar from election to the Commons men who were not of independent\r\nmeans. Through some years the Labor Party was accustomed to provide\r\nfunds wherewith its representatives were enabled to maintain\r\nthemselves at the capital,[184] but this arrangement affected only a\r\nsmall group of members and was of an entirely private and casual\r\nnature. Public and systematic payment of members, to the end that poor\r\nbut capable men might not be kept out of the Commons, was demanded by\r\nthe Chartists three-quarters of a century ago, and from time to time\r\nafter 1870 there was agitation in behalf of such a policy. In 1893,\r\nand again in 1895, a resolution in favor of the payment of members was\r\nadopted in the Commons, and March 7, 1906, a resolution was carried to\r\nthe effect that every member should be paid a salary of £300 annually.\r\nBut it was not until 1911 that a measure of the kind could be got\r\nthrough the upper chamber. Fresh impetus was afforded by the Osborne\r\nJudgment, in which, on an appeal from the lower courts, the House of\r\nLords ruled in December, 1909, that the payment of parliamentary   (p. 128)\r\nmembers as such from the dues collected by labor organizations was\r\ncontrary to law. The announcement of the Judgment was followed by\r\npersistent agitation for legislation to reverse the ruling. In\r\nconnection with the budget presented to the Commons by the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer May 16, 1911, the proposition was made, not to take\r\naction one way or the other upon the Lords' decision, but to provide\r\nfor the payment to all non-official members of the House of Commons of\r\na yearly salary of £400; and with little delay and no great amount of\r\nopposition the proposal was enacted into law. The amount of the salary\r\nprovided is not large, but it is ample to render candidacy for seats\r\npossible for numbers of men who formerly could not under any\r\ncircumstances have contemplated a public career.[185]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 184: The sum provided from the party\r\n                   funds was ordinarily £200 a year.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 185: On the privileges of the Commons see\r\n                   Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, I.,\r\n                   153-189; Lowell, Government of England, I., Chap.\r\n                   11; Walpole, Electorate and Legislature, Chap. 5;\r\n                   Redlich, Procedure of the House of Commons, III.,\r\n                   42-50.

THE FUNCTIONS OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the king summons the two chambers he does so, \"being desirous and\r\nresolved as soon as may be to meet his people, and to have their\r\nadvice in Parliament.\" No mention is made of legislative or financial\r\nbusiness, and, technically, Parliament is still essentially what\r\noriginally it was exclusively, i.e., a purely deliberative\r\nassemblage. Practically, however, the mere discussion of public\r\nquestions and the giving of advice to the crown has become but one of\r\nseveral distinctive parliamentary functions. The newer functions\r\nwhich, with the passing of time, have acquired ever increasing\r\nimportance are, in effect, three. The first is that of criticism,\r\ninvolving the habitual scrutiny and control of the measures of the\r\nexecutive and administrative organs. The second is the exercise, under\r\nlimitations to be described, of the power of judicature. The third,\r\nand much the most important, is the function of public and private\r\nlegislation and of fiscal control.\r\n\r\n*135. Criticism: Ministerial Responsibility.*--Parliament does not\r\ngovern and is not intended to govern. Never save when the Long\r\nParliament undertook the administration of public affairs through\r\ncommittees of its members has Parliament asserted a disposition to\r\ngather immediately into its own hands those powers of state which are\r\nexecutive in character. At the same time, the growth of parliamentary\r\ngovernment has meant the establishment of a connection between the\r\nexecutive and the parliamentary chambers (principally the Commons) (p. 129)\r\nas close as may be so long as separateness of organization is still\r\nmaintained. The officials who comprise the working executive are\r\ninvariably members of Parliament. They initiate public measures,\r\nintroduce them, advocate and defend them, and, in general, guide and\r\ncontrol the conduct of public business both inside and outside the\r\nchambers. But for every act they are responsible directly to the House\r\nof Commons. They may continue in power only so long as they are\r\nsupported by a majority in that chamber. And their conduct is subject\r\ncontinually to review and criticism, through the instrumentality of\r\nquestions, formal inquiries, and, if need be, judicial procedure.\r\n\r\nIt is within the competence of any member to address a question to any\r\nminister of the crown who is also a member, to obtain information.\r\nExcept in special cases, notice of questions must be given at least\r\none day in advance, and a period of approximately three-quarters of an\r\nhour is set apart at four sittings every week for the asking and\r\nanswering of such questions. A minister may answer or decline to\r\nanswer, but unless a declination can be shown to arise from legitimate\r\nconsiderations of public interest its effect politically may be\r\nembarrassing. In any event, there is no debate, and in this respect\r\nthe English practice differs from the French \"interpellation.\"[186]\r\nThe asking of questions is liable to abuse but, as is pointed out by\r\nIlbert, \"there is no more valuable safeguard against maladministration,\r\nno more effective method of bringing the searchlight of criticism to\r\nbear on the action or inaction of the executive government and its\r\nsubordinates. A minister has to be constantly asking himself, not\r\nmerely whether his proceedings and the proceedings of those for whom\r\nhe is responsible are legally or technically defensible, but what kind\r\nof answer he can give if questioned about them in the House, and how\r\nthat answer will be received.\"[187] Any member is privileged to bring\r\nforward a motion censuring the Government or any member or department\r\nthereof, and a motion of this sort, when emanating from the leader of\r\nthe Opposition, constitutes a vote of confidence upon whose result may\r\ndepend the continued tenure of the ministry. By a call upon the\r\nGovernment or a given department for information, by the constitution\r\nof parliamentary committees, departmental committees, or royal\r\ncommissions, and, in particular by taking advantage of the numberless\r\nopportunities afforded by the enactment of appropriation bills, the\r\nHouse of Commons may further impose upon the executive the most\r\nthoroughgoing responsibility and control. \"A strong executive      (p. 130)\r\ngovernment, tempered and controlled by constant, vigilant, and\r\nrepresentative criticism,\" is the ideal at which the parliamentary\r\ninstitutions of Great Britain are aimed.[188]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 186: See p. 314.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 187: Parliament, 113-114.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 188: Ilbert, Parliament, 119.

Judicial Powers: Impeachment and Attainder.*--The functions of a\r\njudicial character which, in the capacity of the High Court of\r\nParliament, the two chambers fulfill are of secondary importance and\r\ndo not call for extended discussion. So far as the law of the subject\r\ngoes, they comprise (1) the powers possessed by each of the houses to\r\ndeal with the constitution and conduct of its own membership; (2) the\r\npower of the Lords to try their own members when charged with treason\r\nor felony; (3) the jurisdiction of the Lords in the capacity of a\r\nfinal court of appeal for the United Kingdom; (4) the power of the two\r\nhouses, acting jointly, to carry through impeachments of public\r\nofficers and to enact bills of attainder; and (5) the effecting of the\r\nremoval of certain kinds of public officers through the agency of an\r\naddress from both houses to the crown. In days when the king and the\r\nministers were disposed to defy the law and to evade responsibility\r\nthe power of impeachment by the Commons at the bar of the Lords,\r\noriginated as early as the reign of Edward III., was of the utmost\r\nimportance. When, however, the House of Commons progressed in\r\ncompetence to the point where it was able to review and control the\r\nconduct of ministers with such thoroughness and continuity as to make\r\nit impossible for them to conduct business without a parliamentary\r\nmajority, impeachment lost its value and fell into disuse. The last\r\noccasion upon which impeachment proceedings were instituted was in\r\n1805.[189] Procedure by bill of attainder, arising from the\r\nlegislative omnipotence of Parliament and following the ordinary\r\ncourse of legislation, is also obsolete.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 189: Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, I., 362-366; Moran, English\r\n                   Government, 327-332.]\r\n\r\n*137. The House of Lords as a Court.*--Most important among surviving\r\nparliamentary functions of a judicial character is the exercise of\r\nappellate jurisdiction by the House of Lords. The judicial authority\r\nof the Lords is an anomaly, although as it is actually exercised it\r\ndoes not seriously contravene the principle which forbids the bringing\r\ntogether of judicial and legislative powers in the same hands.\r\nHistorically, it arose from a confusion of the functions of two groups\r\nof men which were long largely identical in personnel, i.e., the\r\nGreat Council, on the one hand, and the Lords of Parliament, on    (p. 131)\r\nthe other. In the reign of Henry IV. the Commons asked specifically to\r\nbe relieved from judicial business, and the parliamentary jurisdiction\r\nwhich survived was recognized thereafter to be vested in the House of\r\nLords alone. From an early date this jurisdiction was, as it is\r\nto-day, both original and appellate. As a court of first instance the\r\nchamber acquired the right to try peers charged with treason and\r\nfelony and, on the accusation of the House of Commons, to bring to\r\njustice, through the process of impeachment, offenders who were not of\r\nthe peerage. Nowadays these powers are of no practical consequence.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Lords as an appellate tribunal, however, is still\r\na fundamental fact in the judicial system. Starting with control, by\r\nway of appeal, over the courts of common law in England, the chamber\r\nacquired in time a similar control over the English courts of\r\nchancery, and eventually over the courts of both Scotland and Ireland.\r\nIts jurisdiction has stopped short only of the ecclesiastical courts,\r\nand of the courts of the outlying portions of the Empire, appeals from\r\nwhich are heard in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. By the\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873, whereby the higher tribunals\r\nof the realm were remodelled, the appellate jurisdiction of the Lords\r\nwas abolished outright; but in 1876, before the measure had been put\r\nin operation the plan was modified and there was passed the Appellate\r\nJurisdiction Act whereby the appellate functions of the Lords were\r\nrestored and provision was made for the creation at first of two,\r\nlater of three, and eventually of four, salaried life peers, to be\r\nselected from men of eminence in the law, and to be known as Lords of\r\nAppeal in Ordinary. In so far as it is controlled by statute at all,\r\nthe appellate jurisdiction of the chamber is regulated to-day by this\r\nmeasure. Nominally, judicial business is transacted by the House as a\r\nwhole, and every member has a right not only to be present but to\r\nparticipate in the rendering of decisions. Actually, such business is\r\ntransacted by a little group of law lords (the attendance of but three\r\nbeing necessary) under the presidency of the Lord Chancellor, and the\r\nunwritten rule which prohibits the presence at judicial sessions of\r\nany persons save the law lords is quite as strictly observed as is any\r\none of a score of other important conventions of the constitution.[190]\r\nUnder the act of 1876 it is within the competence of the law lords to\r\nsit and to pronounce judgments in the name of the House at any time,\r\nregardless of whether Parliament is in session.[191] A sitting of the\r\nCourt is, technically, a sitting of the Lords, and all actions     (p. 132)\r\ntaken are entered in the Journal of the House as a part of its\r\nproceedings.[192]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 190: Lowell, Government of England, II.,\r\n                   465.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 191: When Parliament is in session the\r\n                   sittings of the law lords are held, as a rule,\r\n                   prior to the beginning of the regular sitting at\r\n                   4.30 p.m.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 192: The judicial functions of Parliament\r\n                   are described at some length in Anson, Law and\r\n                   Custom of the Constitution, I., Chap. 9.

Holdsworth,\r\n                   History of English Law, I., 170-193.]\r\n\r\n*138. Control of Legislation and Finance.*--The principal and altogether\r\nmost indispensable ends which Parliament to-day subserves are those of\r\nlegislation and of financial control. Many of the measures, important\r\nand unimportant, under which the affairs of the realm are regulated\r\nare but temporary and require annual re-enactment, and the volume of\r\nfresh legislation which is unceasingly demanded is all but limitless.\r\nSimilarly, to employ the words of Anson, the revenues which accrue to\r\nthe crown and can be dealt with independently of Parliament would\r\nhardly carry on the business of government for a day,[193] and not\r\nonly does Parliament (in effect, the House of Commons) by its\r\nappropriation acts make possible the legal expenditure of virtually\r\nall public moneys; it provides, by its measures of taxation, the funds\r\nfrom which appropriations are made.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 193: Law and Custom of the Constitution,\r\n                   I., 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. GENERAL ASPECTS OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nBy reason of the supreme importance which attaches to the legislative\r\nand fiscal activities of the two chambers it is necessary that\r\nattention be directed at this point to the character of the procedure\r\nwhich these activities involve. For the purpose in hand it will be\r\nsufficient to speak of only the more important principles of procedure\r\nin relation to the three fundamental phases of legislative work: (1)\r\nthe enactment of non-financial public bills, (2) the adoption of money\r\nbills, and (3) the passage of private bills. And within at least the\r\nfirst two of these domains the preponderance of the Commons is such\r\nthat the procedure of that chamber alone need be described. The\r\nprocedure of the two chambers upon bills is substantially the same,\r\nalthough, as is illustrated by the fact that amendments to bills may\r\nbe introduced in the Lords at any stage but in the Commons at only\r\nstipulated stages, the methods of conducting business in the upper\r\nhouse are more elastic than those prevailing in the lower.\r\n\r\n*139. Fundamental Principles.*--The legislative omnipotence of\r\nParliament has been emphasized sufficiently.[194] Any sort of measure\r\nupon any conceivable subject may be introduced and, if a sufficient\r\nnumber of the members are so minded, enacted into law. No measure  (p. 133)\r\nmay become law until it has been submitted for the consideration of\r\nboth houses, but under the terms of the Parliament Act of 1911 it has\r\nbeen rendered easy for money bills, and not impossible for bills of\r\nother sorts, to be made law without the assent of the House of Lords.\r\nIn the ordinary course of things, a measure is introduced in one\r\nhouse, put through three readings, sent to the other house, put there\r\nthrough the same routine, deposited with the House of Lords to await\r\nthe royal assent,[195] and, after having been assented to as a matter\r\nof course, proclaimed as law. Bills, as a rule, may be introduced in\r\neither house, by the Government or by a private member. It is\r\nimportant to observe, however, in the first place, that certain\r\nclasses of measures must originate in one or the other of the houses,\r\ne.g., money bills in the Commons and bills of attainder and other\r\njudicial bills in the Lords, and, in the second place, that with the\r\ngrowth of the leadership of the Government in legislation the\r\nimportance, if not the number, of privately introduced bills has\r\ntended steadily to be decreased, and likewise the chances of their\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 194: See p. 45.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 195: Except that money bills remain in\r\n                   the custody of the Commons.]\r\n\r\n*140. Public Bills: First and Second Readings.*--The steps through which\r\na public bill, whether introduced by the Government or by a private\r\nmember, must pass in the Commons are still numerous, but by the\r\nreduction of some of them to sheer formalities which involve neither\r\ndebate nor vote the actual legislative process has been made much more\r\nexpeditious than once it was. The necessary stages in the enactment of\r\na bill in either house are, as a rule, five: first reading, second\r\nreading, consideration by committee, report from committee, and third\r\nreading. Formerly the introduction of a measure involved almost\r\ninvariably a speech explaining at length the nature of the proposal,\r\nfollowed by a debate and a vote, sometimes consuming, in all, several\r\nsittings. Nowadays only very important Government bills are introduced\r\nin this manner. In the case of all other bills the first reading has\r\nbecome a mere formality, involving nothing more than a motion on the\r\npart of a member, official or private, for permission to bring in a\r\nmeasure and the giving of leave by the House, almost invariably\r\nwithout discussion. Upon all measures save the most important\r\nGovernment projects, opportunity for debate is first afforded at the\r\nsecond reading, although the discussion at this stage must relate to\r\ngeneral principles rather than to details. By the adoption of a motion\r\nthat the bill be read a second time \"this day six months\" (or at some\r\nother date falling beyond the anticipated limits of the session) a\r\nmeasure may at this point be killed.\r\n\r\n*141. Public Bills: Later Stages.*--A bill which survives the      (p. 134)\r\nsecond reading is \"committed.\" Prior to 1907 it would go normally to\r\nthe Committee of the Whole. Nowadays it goes there if it is a money\r\nbill or a bill for confirming a provisional order,[196] or if, on\r\nother grounds, the House so directs; otherwise it goes to one of the\r\nfour standing committees, assignment being made by the Speaker. This\r\nis the stage at which the provisions of the measure are considered in\r\ndetail and amendments are introduced. After the second reading, however,\r\na bill may be referred to a select committee, and in the event that\r\nthis is done a step is added to the process, for after being returned\r\nby the select committee the measure goes to the Committee of the Whole\r\nor to one of the standing committees. Eventually the bill is reported\r\nback to the House. If reported by a standing committee or, in amended\r\nform by the Committee of the Whole, it is considered by the House\r\nafresh and in some detail; otherwise, the \"report stage\" is omitted.\r\nFinally comes the third reading, the question now being whether the\r\nHouse approves the measure as a whole. At this stage any amendment\r\nbeyond verbal changes necessitates recommitment. The carrying of a\r\nmeasure through these successive stages is spread over, as a rule,\r\nseveral days, and sometimes several weeks, but it is not impossible\r\nthat the entire process be completed during the period of a sitting.\r\nHaving been adopted by the originating house, a bill is taken by a\r\nclerk to the other house, there to be subjected to substantially the\r\nsame procedure. If amendments are introduced, it is sent back in order\r\nthat the suggested changes may be considered by the first house. If\r\nthey are agreed to, the measure is sent up for the royal approval. If\r\nthey are rejected and an agreement between the two houses cannot be\r\nreached, the measure falls.[197]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 196: See p. 138.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 197: The legislative process is summed up\r\n                   aptly by Lowell as follows: \"Leaving out of account\r\n                   the first reading, which rarely involves a real\r\n                   debate, the ordinary course of a public bill\r\n                   through the House of Commons gives, therefore, an\r\n                   opportunity for two debates upon its general\r\n                   merits, and between them two discussions of its\r\n                   details, or one debate upon the details if that one\r\n                   results in no changes, or if the bill has been\r\n                   referred to a standing committee. When the House\r\n                   desires to collect evidence it does so after\r\n                   approving of the general principle, and before\r\n                   taking up the details. Stated in this way the whole\r\n                   matter is plain and rational enough. It is, in\r\n                   fact, one of the many striking examples of\r\n                   adaptation in the English political system. A\r\n                   collection of rules that appear cumbrous and\r\n                   antiquated, and that even now are well-nigh\r\n                   incomprehensible when described in all their\r\n                   involved technicality, have been pruned away until\r\n                   they furnish a procedure almost as simple, direct,\r\n                   and appropriate as any one could devise.\"\r\n                   Government of England, I., 277-278.

Money Bills: Appropriation and Finance Acts.*--The           (p. 135)\r\nprocedure followed in the handling of money bills differs materially\r\nfrom that which has been described. Underlying it are two fundamental\r\nprinciples, incorporated in the standing orders of the House of\r\nCommons during the first quarter of the eighteenth century. One of\r\nthem prescribes that no petition or motion for the granting of money\r\nshall be proceeded upon save in Committee of the Whole. The other\r\nforbids the receiving of any petition, or the proceeding upon any\r\nmotion, for a charge upon the public revenue unless recommended from\r\nthe crown. Although these principles apply technically only to\r\nappropriations, they have long been observed with equal fidelity in\r\nrespect to the raising of revenue. All specific measures for the\r\nexpending of money and all proposals for the imposing of fresh\r\ntaxation or the increase of existing taxation must emanate from the\r\ncrown, i.e., in practice from the cabinet. A private member may go no\r\nfurther in this direction than to introduce resolutions of a wholly\r\ngeneral character favoring some particular kind of expenditure, except\r\nthat it is within his right to move to repeal or to reduce taxes which\r\nthe Government has not proposed to modify.\r\n\r\nTwo great fiscal measures are introduced and carried through annually:\r\nthe Appropriation Act, in which are brought together all the grants\r\nfor the public services for the year, and the Finance Act in which are\r\ncomprised all regulations relating to the revenue and the national\r\ndebt. Before the close of the fiscal year (March 31) the ministry\r\nsubmits to the Commons a body of estimates for the \"supply services,\"\r\ndrawn up originally by the government departments, scrutinized by the\r\nTreasury, and approved by the cabinet. Early in the session the House\r\nresolves itself into a Committee of the Whole on Supply, by which\r\nresolutions of supply are discussed, adopted, and reported. These\r\nresolutions are embodied in bills which, for purposes of convenience,\r\nare passed at intervals during the session. But at the close all of\r\nthem are consolidated in one grand Appropriation Act.[198] Upwards of\r\nhalf of the public expenditures, it is to be observed, e.g., the\r\nCivil List, the salaries of judges, pensions, and interest on the\r\nnational debt, are provided for by permanent acts imposing charges (p. 136)\r\nupon the Consolidated Fund and do not come annually under parliamentary\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 198: Before the lapse of a twelvemonth\r\n                   unforeseen contingencies require invariably the\r\n                   voting of \"supplementary grants.\"]\r\n\r\n*143. The Budget.*--As soon as practicable after the close of the fiscal\r\nyear the House, resolved for the purpose into Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, receives from the Chancellor of the Exchequer his Budget, or\r\nannual statement of accounts. The statement comprises regularly three\r\nparts: a review of revenue and expenditure during the year just\r\nclosed, a provisional balance-sheet for the year to come, and a series\r\nof proposals for the remission, modification, or fresh imposition of\r\ntaxes. Revenues, as expenditures, are in large part \"permanent,\" yet a\r\nvery considerable proportion are provided for through the medium of\r\nyearly votes. In Committee of Ways and Means the House considers the\r\nChancellor's proposals, and after they have been reported back and\r\nembodied in a bill they are carried with the assent of the crown,\r\nthough no longer necessarily of the Lords, into law. Prior to 1861 it\r\nwas customary to include in the fiscal resolutions and in the bill in\r\nwhich they were embodied only the annual and temporary taxes, but in\r\nconsequence of the Lords' rejection, in 1860, of a separate finance\r\nbill repealing the duties on paper it was made the practice to\r\nincorporate in a single bill--the so-called Finance Bill--provision\r\nfor all taxes, whether temporary or permanent. In practice the House\r\nof Commons rarely refuses to approve the financial measures\r\nrecommended by the Government. The chamber has no power to propose\r\neither expenditure or taxation, and the right which it possesses to\r\nrefuse or to reduce the levies and the appropriations asked for is\r\nseldom used. \"Financially,\" says Lowell, \"its work is rather\r\nsupervision than direction; and its real usefulness consists in\r\nsecuring publicity and criticism rather than in controlling\r\nexpenditure.\"[199] The theory underlying fiscal procedure has been\r\nsummed up lucidly as follows: \"The Crown demands money, the Commons\r\ngrant it, and the Lords assent to the grant;[200] but the Commons do\r\nnot vote money unless it be required by the Crown; nor impose or\r\naugment taxes unless they be necessary for meeting the supplies which\r\nthey have voted or are about to vote, and for supplying general\r\ndeficiencies in the revenue. The Crown has no concern in the nature or\r\ndistribution of the taxes; but the foundation of all Parliamentary\r\ntaxation is its necessity for the public service as declared by the\r\nCrown through its constitutional advisers.\"[201]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 199: Government of England, I., 288.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 200: Since the enactment of the\r\n                   Parliament Bill of 1911, as has been observed, the\r\n                   assent of the Lords is not necessary. See p. 112.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 201: The procedure involved in the\r\n                   handling of money bills is described in Lowell,\r\n                   Government of England, I., Chap. 14; Anson, Law and\r\n                   Custom of the Constitution, I., 268-281; Walpole,\r\n                   Electorate and Legislature, Chap. 7; Todd,\r\n                   Parliamentary Government, II., 186-271; Ilbert,\r\n                   Parliament, Chap. 4; Redlich, Procedure of the\r\n                   House of Commons, III., 113-174; May, Treatise on\r\n                   the Law, Privileges, Proceedings, and Usage of\r\n                   Parliament, Chap. 21.

(2d ed., London,\r\n                   1888).]\r\n\r\n*144. Private Bills: Nature and Procedure.*--In the matter of      (p. 137)\r\nprocedure there is no distinction between a Government bill and a\r\nprivate member's bill. Both are public bills. But a private bill is\r\nhandled in a manner largely peculiar to itself. A public bill is one\r\nwhich affects the general interests of the state, and which has for\r\nits object presumably the promotion of the common good. A private bill\r\nis one which has in view the interest of some particular locality,\r\nperson, or collection of persons. The commonest object of private\r\nbills is to enable private individuals to enter into combination to\r\nundertake works of public utility--the building of railways or\r\ntramways, the construction of harbors or piers, the draining of\r\nswamps, the supplying of water, gas, or electricity, and the embarking\r\nupon a wide variety of other enterprises which in the United States\r\nwould be regulated chiefly by state legislatures and city councils--at\r\ntheir own risk and, in part at least, for their own profit. All\r\nprivate bills originate in petitions, which must be submitted in\r\nadvance of the opening of the session during which they are to be\r\nconsidered. Their presentation and the various stages of their\r\nprogress are governed by very detailed and stringent regulations, and\r\nfees are required from both promoters and opponents, so that the\r\nenactment of a private bill of importance becomes for the parties\r\ndirectly concerned an expensive process, and for the Exchequer a\r\nsource of no inconsiderable amount of revenue.\r\n\r\nAfter having been scrutinized and approved by parliamentary officials\r\nknown as Examiners of Petitions for Private Bills, a private bill is\r\nintroduced in one of the two houses.[202] Its introduction is\r\nequivalent to its first reading. At its second reading debate may take\r\nplace upon the principle of the measure, after which the bill, if\r\nopposed, is referred to a Private Bill Committee consisting of four\r\nmembers and a disinterested referee. If the bill be not opposed, i.e.,\r\nif no adverse petition has been filed by property owners,\r\ncorporations, or other interests, the committee of reference, under a\r\nstanding order of 1903, consists of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman\r\nof Ways and Means, two other members of the House, appointed by    (p. 138)\r\nthe Committee of Selection, and the Counsel to Mr. Speaker. The\r\ncommittee stage of a contested bill assumes an essentially judicial\r\naspect. Promoters and opponents are represented by counsel, witnesses\r\nare examined, and expert testimony is taken. After being reported by\r\ncommittee, the measure goes its way under the same regulations as\r\nthose controlling the progress of public bills.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 202: To facilitate their consideration,\r\n                   such measures are distributed approximately equally\r\n                   between the two houses. This is done through\r\n                   conference of the Chairmen of Committees of the two\r\n                   houses, or their counsel, prior to the assembling\r\n                   of Parliament.]\r\n\r\n*145. Provisional Orders.*--Two things are, however, to be noted. The\r\nfirst one is that while in theory the distinction between a public and\r\na private bill is clear, in point of fact there is no little\r\ndifficulty in drawing a line of demarcation, and the result has been\r\nthe recognition of an indefinite class of \"hybrid\" bills, partly\r\npublic and partly private in content and handled under some\r\ncircumstances as the one and under others as the other, or even under\r\na procedure combining features of both. The second fact to be observed\r\nis that, in part to reduce expense and in part to procure the\r\ngood-will of the executive department concerned, it has become common\r\nfor the promoters of enterprises requiring parliamentary sanction to\r\nmake use of the device known as provisional orders. A provisional\r\norder is an order issued, after minute investigation, by a government\r\ndepartment authorizing provisionally the undertaking of a project in\r\nbehalf of which application has been made. It requires eventually the\r\nsanction of Parliament, but such orders are laid before the houses in\r\ngroups by the several departments and their ratification is virtually\r\nassured in advance. It is pointed out by Lowell that during the years\r\n1898-1901 not one-tenth of the provisional orders laid before\r\nParliament were opposed, and but one failed of adoption.[203]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 203: Government of England, I., 385.

The standard treatise upon the\r\n                   subject is F. Clifford, History of Private Bill\r\n                   Legislation, 2 vols. (London, 1885-1887).

THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN THE TWO HOUSES\r\n\r\n\"How can I learn the rules of the Commons?\" was a question once put by\r\nan Irish member to Mr. Parnell. \"By breaking them,\" was the\r\nphilosophic reply. Representing, as it does, an accumulation through\r\ncenturies of deliberately adopted regulations, interwoven and overlaid\r\nwith unwritten custom, the code of procedure by which the conduct of\r\nbusiness in the House of Commons is governed is indeed intricate   (p. 139)\r\nand forbidding. Lord Palmerston admitted that he never fully mastered\r\nit, and Gladstone was not infrequently an inadvertent offender against\r\nthe \"rules of the House.\" Prior to the nineteenth century the rules\r\nwere devised, as is pointed out by Anson, with two objects in view: to\r\nprotect the House from hasty and ill-considered action pressed forward\r\nby the king's ministers, and to secure fair play between the parties\r\nin the chamber and a hearing for all. It was not until 1811 that\r\nbusiness of the Government was permitted to obtain recognized\r\nprecedence on certain days; but the history of the procedure of the\r\nCommons since that date is a record of (1) the general reduction of\r\nthe time during which private members may indulge in the discussion of\r\nsubjects or measures lying outside the Government's legislative\r\nprogramme, (2) increasing limitation of the opportunity for raising\r\ngeneral questions at the various stages of Government business, and\r\n(3) the cutting down of the time allowed for discussing at all the\r\nprojects to which the Government asks the chambers' assent.[204]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 204: Anson, Law and Custom of the\r\n                   Constitution, I., 253.]\r\n\r\n*146. Rules.*--The rules governing debate and decorum are not only\r\nelaborate but, in some instances, of great antiquity. In so far as\r\nthey have been reduced to writing they may be said to comprise (1)\r\n\"standing orders\" of a permanent character, (2) \"sessional orders,\"\r\noperative during a session only, and (3) \"general orders,\"\r\nindeterminate in respect to period of application. In the course of\r\ndebate all remarks are addressed to the Speaker and in the event that\r\nthe floor is desired by more than one member it rests with the Speaker\r\nto designate, with scrupulous impartiality, who shall have it. When a\r\n\"division\" is in progress and the doors are closed members speak\r\nseated and covered, but at all other times they speak standing and\r\nuncovered. A speech may not be read from manuscript, and it is within\r\nthe competence of the Speaker not only to warn a member against\r\nirrelevance or repetition but to compel him to terminate his\r\nremarks.[205] A member whose conduct is reprehensible may be ordered\r\nto withdraw and, upon vote of the House, may be suspended from\r\nservice. Except in committee, a member may not speak twice upon the\r\nsame question, although he may be allowed the floor a second time to\r\nexplain a portion of his speech which has been misunderstood. Undue\r\nobstruction is not tolerated, and the Speaker may decline to put a\r\nmotion which he considers dilatory.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 205: On parliamentary oratory see Graham,\r\n                   The Mother of Parliaments, 203-224.]\r\n\r\n*147. Closure and the Guillotine.*--For the further limitation of debate\r\ntwo important and drastic devices are at all times available. One is\r\nordinary closure and the other is \"the guillotine.\" Closure dates\r\noriginally from 1881. It was introduced in the standing orders of  (p. 140)\r\nthe House in 1882, and it assumed its present form in 1888.[206] It\r\nsprang from the efforts of the House to curb the intolerably\r\nobstructionist tactics employed a generation ago by the Irish\r\nNationalists, but by reason of the increasing mass of business to be\r\ndisposed of and the tendency of large deliberative bodies to waste\r\ntime, it has been found too useful to be given up. \"After a question\r\nhas been proposed,\" reads Standing Order 26, \"a member rising in his\r\nplace may claim to move 'that the Question be now put,' and unless it\r\nshall appear to the Chair that such motion is an abuse of the Rules of\r\nthe House, or an infringement of the rights of the minority, the\r\nQuestion 'that the Question be now put' shall be put forthwith and\r\ndecided without amendment or debate.\" Discussion may thus be cut off\r\ninstantly and a vote precipitated. Closure is inoperative, however,\r\nunless the number of members voting in the majority for its adoption\r\nis at least one hundred, or, in a standing committee, twenty.\r\n\r\nA more generally effective device by which discussion is limited and\r\nthe transaction of business is facilitated is that known as \"closure\r\nby compartments,\" or \"the guillotine.\" When this is employed the House\r\nin advance of the consideration of a bill agrees upon an allotment of\r\ntime to the various parts or stages of the measure, and at the\r\nexpiration of each period debate, whether concluded or not, is closed,\r\na vote is taken, and a majority adopts that portion of the bill upon\r\nwhich the guillotine has fallen. In recent years this device has been\r\nemployed almost invariably when an important Government bill is\r\nreserved for consideration in Committee of the Whole. Its advantage is\r\nthe saving of time and the ensuring that by a given date final action\r\nupon a measure shall have been taken. Prior to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century liberty of discussion in the Commons was all but\r\nunrestrained, save by what an able authority on English parliamentary\r\npractice has termed \"the self-imposed parliamentary discipline of the\r\nparties.\"[206] The enormous change which has come about is\r\nattributable to two principal causes, congestion of business and the\r\nrise of obstructionism. The effect has been, among other things, to\r\naccentuate party differences and to involve occasional disregard of\r\nthe rights of minorities.[207]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 206: The name was first employed in\r\n                   1887.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 207: Redlich, Procedure of the House of\r\n                   Commons, I., 133-212; Graham, The Mother of\r\n                   Parliaments, 158-172. An excellent illustration of\r\n                   the use of the guillotine is afforded by the\r\n                   history of the passage of the National Insurance\r\n                   Bill of 1911. See _Annual Register_ (1911),\r\n                   232-236.]\r\n\r\n*148. Votes and Divisions.*--When debate upon the whole or a portion of\r\na measure is terminated there takes place a vote, which may or may\r\nnot involve, technically, a \"division.\" The Speaker or Chairman    (p. 141)\r\nstates the question to be voted upon and calls for the ayes and noes.\r\nHe announces the apparent result and, if his decision is not\r\nchallenged, the vote is so recorded. If, however, any member objects,\r\nstrangers are asked to withdraw (save from the places reserved for\r\nthem), electric bells are rung throughout the building, the two-minute\r\nsand-glass is turned, and at the expiration of the time the doors are\r\nlocked. The question is then repeated and another oral vote is taken.\r\nIf there is still lack of acquiescence in the announced result, the\r\nSpeaker orders a division. The ayes pass into the lobby at the\r\nSpeaker's right and the noes into that at his left, and all are\r\ncounted by four tellers designated by the Speaker, two from each side,\r\nas the members return to their places in the chamber. This method of\r\ntaking a division has undergone but little change since 1836. Under a\r\nstanding order of 1888 the Speaker is empowered, in the event that he\r\nconsiders a demand for a division dilatory or irresponsible, to call\r\nupon the ayes and noes to rise in their places and be counted; but\r\nthere is seldom occasion for resort to this variation from the\r\nestablished practice. The device of \"pairing\" is not unknown, and when\r\nthe question is one of political moment the fact is made obvious by\r\nthe activity of the party \"whips\" in behalf of the interests which\r\nthey represent.[208]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 208: On the conduct of business in the\r\n                   Commons see Lowell, Government of England, I,\r\n                   Chaps. 15-16; Moran, English Government, Chap. 15;\r\n                   Walpole, Electorate and Legislature, Chap. 8;\r\n                   Ilbert, Parliament, Chap. 5; Redlich, Procedure of\r\n                   the House of Commons, II., 215-264, III., 1-41;\r\n                   May, Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings,\r\n                   and Usage of Parliament, Chaps, 8-12; Medley,\r\n                   Manual of English Constitutional History, 231-284;\r\n                   Graham, The Mother of Parliaments, 225-258; and\r\n                   MacDonaugh, The Book of Parliament, 217-247.]\r\n\r\n*149. Procedure in the Lords.*--The rules of procedure of the House of\r\nLords are in theory simple, and in practice yet more so. Nominally,\r\nall measures of importance, after being read twice, are considered in\r\nCommittee of the Whole, referred to a standing committee for textual\r\nrevision, reported, and accorded final adoption or rejection. In\r\npractice the process is likely to be abbreviated. Few bills, for\r\nexample, are actually referred to the revision committee. For the\r\nexamination of such measures as seem to require it committees are\r\nconstituted for the session, and others are created from time to time\r\nas need of them appears, but the comparative leisure of the chamber\r\npermits debate within the Committee of the Whole upon any measure\r\nwhich the members really care to discuss. Willful obstruction is all\r\nbut unknown, so that there has never been occasion for the adoption of\r\nany form of closure. Important questions are decided, as a rule, by a\r\ndivision. When the question is put those members who desire to\r\nregister an affirmative vote repair to the lobby at the right of   (p. 142)\r\nthe woolsack, those who are opposed to the proposal take their places\r\nin the corresponding lobby at the left, and both groups are counted by\r\ntellers appointed by the presiding officer.

PARLIAMENTARISM AND THE PARTY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n*150. Government by Party.*--Intimately connected with the parliamentary\r\nscheme of government which has been described is the characteristic\r\nBritish system of government by party. Indeed, not merely is there\r\nbetween the two an intimate connection; they are but different aspects\r\nof the same working arrangement. The public affairs of the kingdom at\r\nany given time, as has appeared, are managed by the body of ministers,\r\nacting with and through a supporting majority in the House of Commons.\r\nThese ministers belong to one or the other of the two great political\r\nparties, with only occasional and incidental representation of minor\r\naffiliated political groups. Their supporters in the Commons are, in\r\nthe main, their fellow-partisans, and their tenure of power is\r\ndependent upon the fortunes of their party in Parliament and\r\nthroughout the country. They are at once the working executive, the\r\nguiding agency in legislation, and the leaders and spokesmen of this\r\nparty. Confronting them constantly is the Opposition, consisting of\r\ninfluential exponents of the contrary political faith who, in turn,\r\nlead the rank and file of their party organization; and if at any time\r\nthe ministers in power lose their supporting majority in the Commons,\r\nwhether through adverse results of a national election or otherwise,\r\nthey retire and the Opposition assumes office. The parliamentary\r\nsystem and the party system are thus inextricably related, the one\r\nbeing, indeed, historically the product of the other. It was\r\nprincipally through the agency of party spirit, party contest, and\r\nparty unity that there was established by degrees that single and\r\ncollective responsibility of ministers which lies at the root of\r\nparliamentary government; and, but for the coherence and stability\r\nwith which political activity is invested by party organization, the\r\noperation of the parliamentary system would be an impossibility. The\r\nlaw of the British constitution does not demand the existence of\r\nparties; on the contrary, it affords them no recognition or place. The\r\nconventions, however, both assume and require them.\r\n\r\n*151. Two-Party Organization.*--The relationship which subsists    (p. 144)\r\nbetween parliamentarism and party government is to be accounted for in\r\nno small measure by the fact that the number of great parties in the\r\nUnited Kingdom is but two. Certain continental nations, notably France\r\nand Italy, possess the forms of parliamentary government, adopted\r\nwithin times comparatively recent and taken over largely from Great\r\nBritain. In these countries, however, the multiplicity of parties\r\neffectually prevents the operation of the parliamentary system in the\r\nfashion in which that system operates across the Channel. Ministries\r\nmust be made up invariably of representatives of a number of\r\nessentially independent groups. They are apt to be in-harmonious, to\r\nbe able to execute but indifferently the composite will of the\r\nGovernment coalition in the popular chamber, and, accordingly, to be\r\nshort-lived. Despite the rise in recent decades of the Irish\r\nNationalist and Labor groups, it is still true in Great Britain, as it\r\nhas been since political parties first made their appearance there,\r\nthat two leading party affiliations divide between themselves the\r\nallegiance of the mass of the nation. The defeat of one means the\r\ntriumph of the other, and either alone is competent normally to govern\r\nindependently if elevated to power. This means, on the one hand, a\r\nmuch more thoroughgoing predominance of the governing party than can\r\nbe acquired by a single party in France or Italy and, on the other\r\nhand, a unique concentration of responsibility and, in turn, an\r\nincreased responsiveness to the public will. The leaders of the one\r\nparty for the time in the ascendancy govern the nation, by reason of\r\nthe fact that, _being_ the leaders of this party, they are selected\r\nwithout doubt or equivocation to fill the principal offices of\r\nstate.[210]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 210: For a fuller exposition of the\r\n                   relations of party and the parliamentary system see\r\n                   Lowell, Government of England, I., Chap. 24.

Whigs and Tories.*--The seventeenth-century origins of political\r\nparties in England, the development of Whigs and Tories following the\r\nRevolution of 1688-1689, and the prolonged Whig supremacy during the\r\nreigns of George I. and George II., have been alluded to in another\r\nplace.[211] During the eighteenth century the parliamentary system was\r\nbut slowly coming into its own, and again and again party lines all\r\nbut disappeared. The recurring rivalry of Whig and Tory elements,\r\nhowever, brought about gradually a habitual recognition of the\r\nresponsibility of ministers, and this responsibility, in turn, reacted\r\nto accentuate party demarcation. The efforts of George III. to revive\r\nthe royal prerogative had the effect of calling into existence a body\r\nof new Tories, not Jacobite, but Hanoverian, who supported the king in\r\nhis purpose, and at the same time, of driving the forces of opposition\r\nto a closer union and more constant vigilance. Throughout the century\r\nthe tone of party politics was continuously low. Bribery and other\r\nforms of corruption were rife, and the powers of government, both\r\nnational and local, were in the hands regularly of an aristocratic\r\nminority which ruled in its own interest. The high-water mark of\r\nintrigue was reached in 1783 when the old Tories, led by Lord North,\r\nallied themselves with the old Whigs, led by Charles James Fox, to\r\nretain power and to curtail the influence of the king. The coalition\r\nwas unsuccessful, and the defeat of Fox's India Bill, in December,\r\n1783, became the occasion of the younger Pitt's elevation to the\r\npremiership, followed within three months by a national election which\r\nprecipitated an end of the seventy years of Whig ascendancy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 211: See p. 39.]\r\n\r\n*153. The Tory Ascendancy, 1783-1830.*--Throughout the ensuing forty-six\r\nyears, or until 1830, the new Tory party continued almost\r\nuninterruptedly in power, although it is to be observed that after\r\n1790 the composition and character of this party underwent important\r\nmodification. The first decade of the period covered by the Pitt\r\nministry (1784-1801) was a time of incipient but active propaganda in\r\nbehalf of constitutional, financial, and social reform, and the\r\ngovernment was not disinclined to favor a number of the changes which\r\nwere projected. The outbreak and progress of the Revolution in     (p. 146)\r\nFrance, however, completely altered the situation. The great\r\nlandowners, who constituted the dominating element in the Whig party,\r\ndetested the principles of the Revolution and were insistent in season\r\nand out upon war with France. They secured the support of the\r\nparliamentary classes generally, and Pitt and his colleagues were\r\nforced to surrender to the apprehensions and demands of these\r\nelements. The war was declared by France, but it was provoked mainly\r\nby the hostile attitude of the English people and government. At home\r\nall reform propaganda was stamped out, and Tories and Whigs alike\r\nthroughout the quarter-century of international conflict pointed\r\nhabitually to the abuses by which the upheaval in France was\r\naccompanied as indicative of what might be expected in England, or\r\nanywhere, when once the way was thrown open for unrestrained\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nThe Tories were in power during most of the war period and in 1815\r\ntheir position was seemingly impregnable. During the years covered by\r\nthe ministry of Lord Liverpool (1812-1827), however, their hold was\r\ngradually relaxed. They sought to secure for themselves the support of\r\nthe masses and talked much of the aristocratic exclusiveness of the\r\nWhigs, yet they made it their first concern to maintain absolutely\r\nintact the constitution of the kingdom and the political and social\r\norder by which it was buttressed. As long as England was engaged in a\r\nlife and death contest with Napoleon the staying of innovation was\r\neasy, but after 1815 the task became one of rapidly increasing\r\ndifficulty. In the reign of George IV. (1820-1830) the more\r\nprogressive of the Tory leaders, notably Canning, Huskisson, and Peel,\r\nrecognized that the demands of the nation would have to be met at some\r\npoints, and a number of liberalizing measures were suffered to be\r\ncarried through Parliament, though none which touched directly the\r\nmost serious problems of the day. In 1830 the resignation of the\r\nministry of the Duke of Wellington marked the end of the prolonged\r\nTory ascendancy, and with a ministry presided over by Earl Grey the\r\nWhigs returned to power. With the exception of a few brief intervals\r\nthey and their successors, the Liberals, held office thereafter until\r\n1874.[212]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 212: The party history of the period\r\n                   1700-1792 is related admirably and in much detail\r\n                   in W.

The Liberals and Reform.*--The political history of this second\r\ngreat era of Whig ascendancy falls into some four or five stages. The\r\nfirst, extending from the accession of the Grey ministry in 1830 to\r\nthe parliamentary elections of 1841, was an epoch of notable reforms,\r\nundertaken and carried through mainly by the Whigs, with the\r\nco-operation of various radical elements and of discontented Tories.\r\nThis was the period of the first Reform Act (1832), the emancipation\r\nof slaves in the British colonies (1833), the beginning of\r\nparliamentary appropriations for public education (1833), the Factory\r\nAct of 1833, the New Poor Law (1834), the Municipal Corporations Act\r\n(1835), and a number of other measures designed to meet urgent demands\r\nof humanity and of public interest. This was the time, furthermore, at\r\nwhich the party nomenclature of later days was brought into use. The\r\nname Whig was superseded altogether by that of Liberal, while the name\r\nTory, though not wholly discontinued in everyday usage, was replaced\r\nlargely by the term Conservative.[213] The Liberals were in these\r\nyears peculiarly the party of reform, but it must not be inferred that\r\nthe Conservatives resisted all change or withheld support from all\r\nmeasures of amelioration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 213: The name Conservative was employed\r\n                   by Canning as early as 1824. Its use was already\r\n                   becoming common when, in January, 1835, Peel, in\r\n                   his manifesto to the electors of Tamworth,\r\n                   undertook an exposition of the principles of what\r\n                   he declared should be known henceforth as the\r\n                   Conservative--not the Tory--party.]\r\n\r\n*155. From Peel to Palmerston.*--The second stage of the period under\r\nsurvey was that comprised by the Conservative ministry of Sir Robert\r\nPeel, 1841-1846, established in consequence of the decisive defeat of\r\nthe Whigs at the elections of 1841. The memorable achievement of the\r\nPeel government was the repeal of the Corn Laws and the casting off of\r\nsubstantially the whole of the protective system; but the tariff\r\npolicy of the premier divided the Conservative party into the\r\nprotectionists or old Conservatives, led by Disraeli and Lord Derby,\r\nand the free trade or liberal Conservatives, led by Aberdeen and   (p. 148)\r\nGladstone, and the breach enabled the Liberals, under Lord John\r\nRussell, to recover office in 1847. A third stage of the period, i.e.,\r\n1847 to 1859, was one of ministerial instability. Disputes between\r\nRussell and Palmerston, the foreign minister, undermined the Liberal\r\nposition, and in 1852 the Conservatives, under the leadership of\r\nDerby, returned to power. In 1853, however, the free trade\r\nConservatives joined the Liberals, overthrew Derby, and placed in\r\noffice a coalition ministry under Aberdeen. This government maintained\r\nitself until 1855, when, by reason of discontent aroused by his\r\nmanagement of England's part in the Crimean War, Aberdeen resigned and\r\nwas succeeded by Palmerston, at the head of another Liberal ministry.\r\nForeign difficulties drove Palmerston from office early in 1858, and\r\nthe establishment of a second Derby ministry marked a brief return of\r\nthe Conservatives to control. Defeated, however, on a resolution\r\ncensuring the Government for the inadequacy of the reform bill\r\nintroduced by it in 1859, and also for the failure of Lord Derby to\r\nprevent the war between France and Austria, the ministry resigned, in\r\nApril, 1859, and Lord Palmerston returned to power, with Gladstone and\r\nLord John Russell as colleagues. Gladstone's acceptance of office\r\nunder Palmerston marked the final severance of the Peelites from the\r\nConservative party and the abandonment of all hope of the\r\nreconstruction for which both Gladstone and Derby had labored.\r\n\r\n*156. Party Regeneration.*--A fourth, and final, stage of the Liberal\r\nperiod covered the years 1859 to 1874. Its importance arises not\r\nmerely from the fact that the culmination of the power of the Liberals\r\nduring the nineteenth century was attained at this point, but from the\r\nfurther fact that it was during these years that the Liberal party was\r\ntransformed and popularized so as to be made for the first time really\r\nworthy of the name which it bears. As long as Palmerston lived the\r\nLiberals of the old school, men who disliked radicalism and were\r\ncontent with the reform of 1832, were in the ascendancy, but after the\r\npremier's death, October 18, 1865, new ideas and influences asserted\r\nthemselves and a new Liberal party came rapidly to the fore. This\r\nregenerated party, whose leader was Gladstone, rejected definitely the\r\nideal of _laissez-faire_, took over numerous principles of the\r\nRadicals, and, with the watchwords of \"peace, retrenchment, and\r\nreform,\" began to insist upon a broader parliamentary franchise and\r\nupon fresh legislation for the protection and general betterment of\r\nthe masses. The new liberalism was paralleled, however, by a new\r\nconservatism, whose principal exponent was Disraeli. The new\r\nConservatives likewise advocated franchise reform and legislation for\r\nthe people, although they put more emphasis upon the latter than upon\r\nthe former; and they especially favored a firm foreign policy,     (p. 149)\r\nan extension of British interests in all parts of the world, and the\r\nadoption of a scheme of colonial federation. They appeared, at least,\r\nto have less regard for peace and for economy than had the Liberals.\r\n\r\nThe temper and tendencies of the parties as they gradually assumed\r\nshape during the third quarter of the nineteenth century have been\r\ncharacterized effectively by a recent writer as follows: \"The parties\r\nof which Gladstone and Disraeli were the chiefs were linked by\r\ncontinuous historical succession with the two great sections or\r\nfactions of the aristocracy, or hereditary oligarchy, which ruled\r\nGreat Britain in the eighteenth century. But each had been transformed\r\nby national changes since the Reform Bill. The Whigs had become\r\nLiberals, the Tories had become Conservatives. The Liberal party had\r\nabsorbed part of the principles of the French Revolution. They stood\r\nnow for individual liberty, laying especial stress on freedom of\r\ntrade, freedom of contract, and freedom of competition. They had set\r\nthemselves to break down the rule of the landowner and the Church, to\r\nshake off the fetters of Protection, and to establish equality before\r\nthe law. Their acceptance of egalitarian principles led them to adopt\r\ndemocratic ideals, to advocate extension of the suffrage, and the\r\nemancipation of the working classes. Such principles, though not\r\nrevolutionary, are to some extent disruptive in their tendency; and\r\ntheir adoption by the Liberals had forced the Tory party to range\r\nthemselves in defense of the existing order of things. They professed\r\nto stand for the Crown, the Church, and the Constitution. They were\r\ncompelled by the irresistible trend of events to accept democratic\r\nprinciples and to carry out democratic reforms. They preferred, in\r\nfact, to carry out such reforms themselves, in order that the\r\nsafeguards which they considered necessary might be respected.\r\nDemocratic principles having been adopted, both parties made it their\r\nobject to redress grievances; but the Conservatives showed a natural\r\npredisposition to redress those grievances which arose from excessive\r\nfreedom of competition, the Liberals were the more anxious to redress\r\nthose which were the result of hereditary or customary privilege. The\r\nharmony of the State consists in the equilibrium between the two\r\nopposing forces of liberty and order. The Liberals laid more stress\r\nupon liberty, the Conservatives attached more importance to order and\r\nestablished authority.\"[214]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 214: S. Leathes, in Cambridge Modern\r\n                   History, XII., 30-31.]\r\n\r\n*157. The First Gladstone Ministry.*--Upon the death of Palmerston in\r\n1865 Lord John Russell became premier a second time, but in the course\r\nof the following year a franchise reform bill brought forward by the\r\nGovernment was defeated in the Commons, through the instrumentality\r\nchiefly of a group of old Liberals (the \"Adullamites\") who         (p. 150)\r\nopposed modification of the electoral system, and by curious\r\ncircumstance it fell to the purely Conservative Derby-Disraeli\r\nministry of 1866-1868 not only to carry the first electoral reform\r\nsince 1832 but to impart to that reform a degree of thoroughness upon\r\nwhich none save the most advanced radicals had cared to insist. The\r\nresults of the doubling of the electorate were manifest in the\r\nsubstantial majority which the new Liberals acquired at the elections\r\nof 1868, and the Disraeli ministry (Derby had retired early in the\r\nyear) gave place to a government presided over by the indubitable\r\nleader of the new Liberal forces, Gladstone. The years 1868-1874,\r\ncovered by the first Gladstone ministry, were given distinction by a\r\nremarkable series of reforms, including the disestablishment of the\r\nChurch in Ireland (1869), the enactment of an Irish land bill (1870),\r\nthe institution of national control of elementary education (1870),\r\nand the adoption of the Australian ballot in parliamentary elections\r\n(1872). Defeated at last, however, on an Irish university bill, the\r\nministry resigned, and when, at the elections of 1874, the country was\r\nappealed to, the Conservatives obtained a clear parliamentary majority\r\nof fifty seats.

The Question of Irish Home Rule.*--During the five years covered\r\nby the life of the second Disraeli ministry British imperialism\r\nreached flood tide. The reforms of the Gladstone government were   (p. 151)\r\nnot undone, but the Conservative leaders interested themselves\r\nprincipally in foreign and colonial questions, and home affairs\r\nreceived but scant attention. The result was public discontent, and at\r\nthe elections of 1880 the Liberals obtained a parliamentary majority\r\nof more than one hundred seats. It remained for the second Gladstone\r\ngovernment, established at this point, to adjust a number of\r\ndifficulties on the frontiers of the Empire; but the heart of the\r\nministry was not in this sort of work and the way was cleared as\r\nspeedily as possible for a return to the consideration of problems of\r\na domestic nature. In 1884 the Representation of the People Act was\r\ncarried, and in 1885 the Redistribution of Seats Act. But now, and\r\nthroughout a decade and a half following, the question which\r\novershadowed all others was that of Home Rule for Ireland. Upon this\r\nissue, in its variety of aspects, governments henceforth rose and\r\nfell, parties were disrupted and re-aligned. In 1885 the Parnellites,\r\nor Irish Nationalists, incensed because of Gladstone's indifference to\r\nHome Rule, and taking advantage of the ministry's unpopularity arising\r\nfrom the failure of its Egyptian policy, compassed the defeat of the\r\nGovernment on a measure relating to the taxing of beer and spirits.\r\nThe Marquis of Salisbury, who after the death of Lord Beaconsfield, in\r\n1881, had become leader of the Conservatives, made up a government;\r\nbut, absolutely dependent upon the Irish Nationalist alliance and yet\r\nirrevocably committed against Home Rule, the Salisbury ministry found\r\nitself from the outset in an impossible position.\r\n\r\n*159. The Liberal Unionists.*--The elections at the end of 1885 yielded\r\nthe Conservatives 249 seats, the Irish Nationalists 86, and the\r\nLiberals 335, and January 28, 1880, the Salisbury ministry retired.\r\nGladstone returned to power and Home Rule took its place in the formal\r\nprogramme of the Liberal party. Then followed, April 8, 1886, the\r\nintroduction of the first of Gladstone's memorable Home Rule bills.\r\nThe measure accorded the Irish a separate parliament at Dublin, cut\r\nthem off from representation at Westminster, and required them to bear\r\na proportionate share of the expenses of the Imperial Government. It\r\nwas thrown out by the Commons on the second reading. The Conservatives\r\nopposed it solidly, many of the Irish Nationalists were dissatisfied\r\nwith it, and upwards of a hundred Liberal members, led by Joseph\r\nChamberlain, flatly refused to follow the majority of their\r\nfellow-partisans in voting for it. Under the name of Liberal Unionists\r\nthese dissenters eventually broke entirely from their earlier\r\naffiliation; and, inclining more and more toward the position occupied\r\nby the Conservatives, they ended by losing their identity in the ranks\r\nof that party. Their accession, however, brought the Conservatives\r\nnew vigor, new issues, and even a new name, for in more recent     (p. 152)\r\ndays the term Conservative has been supplanted very generally by that\r\nof Unionist.\r\n\r\n*160. Second Salisbury and Fourth Gladstone Ministries.*--The defeat of\r\nHome Rule was followed by a national election, the result of which was\r\nthe return of 316 Conservatives, 78 Liberal Unionists, 191 Gladstonian\r\nLiberals, and 85 Irish Nationalists. The combined unionists had a\r\nmajority of 118, and July 26, 1886, the short-lived third Gladstone\r\ngovernment was succeeded by a second ministry presided over by the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury. Home Rule, however, was not dead. During the\r\nyears of the Salisbury ministry (1886-1892) the authorities were\r\nobliged to devote much attention to Irish affairs, and in 1892 the\r\nLiberals were returned to office on a platform which stipulated\r\nexpressly Home Rule for Ireland.[216] The Conservative appeal to the\r\ncountry at this time was made on the ground, first, that Home Rule\r\nshould be resisted, and, second, that the Government's achievements in\r\nreform and constructive legislation entitled the party to continuance\r\nin power; but in the new parliament there was an adverse majority of\r\nforty, and August 18 Gladstone, for the fourth time, was requested to\r\nform a ministry.[217] The elections of 1892 are of interest by reason\r\nof the fact that they marked the first appearance of independent labor\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament. Miners' delegates and an agricultural\r\nlaborer had been elected before, but they had identified themselves in\r\nall instances with the radical wing of the Liberals. There were now\r\nreturned, however, four members, including John Burns and Keir Hardie,\r\nwho chose to hold aloof and, as they expressed it, \"to sit in\r\nopposition until they should cross the house to form a labor\r\ngovernment.\" The Home Rule bill which Gladstone introduced February\r\n13, 1893, differed from its predecessor of 1886 principally in not\r\nexcluding the Irish from representation at Westminster. It was passed\r\nin the House of Commons, although by an ultimate majority of but\r\nthirty-four, but in the Lords it was rejected by a vote of 419 to 41.\r\nIn the face of an obstacle so formidable as that imposed by the\r\nadverse majority in the upper chamber it appeared useless to press the\r\nissue. The Lords, whose power in legislation became at this point\r\ngreater than at any time since 1832, systematically balked the\r\nGovernment at every turn, and March 3, 1894, Gladstone, aged and   (p. 153)\r\nweary of parliamentary strife, retired from office. His last speech in\r\nthe Commons comprised a sharp arraignment of the House of Lords, with\r\na forecast of the clash which eventually would lead (and, in point of\r\nfact, has led) to the reconstitution of that chamber.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 216: This was the \"Newcastle Programme,\"\r\n                   drawn up at a convention of the National Liberal\r\n                   Federation at Newcastle in October, 1891. Items in\r\n                   the programme, in addition to Home Rule, included\r\n                   the disestablishment of the Church in Wales and\r\n                   Scotland, a local veto on the sale of intoxicating\r\n                   liquors, the abolition of the plural franchise, and\r\n                   articles defining employers' liability and limiting\r\n                   the hours of labor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 217: C. A. Whitmore, Six Years of\r\n                   Unionist Government, 1886-1892 (London, 1892).]\r\n\r\n*161. Third and Fourth Salisbury Ministries.*--For the time the Earl of\r\nRosebery, who had been foreign secretary, assumed the premiership and\r\nthere was no break in the Government's policy. In June, 1895, however,\r\nthe ministry suffered a defeat on the floor of the Commons, and the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury was a third time invited to form a government.\r\nThe retirement of Gladstone brought to light numerous rifts within the\r\nLiberal party, and when the new ministry, in July, appealed to the\r\ncountry, with Home Rule as a preponderating issue, its supporters\r\nsecured in the Commons a majority of 152 seats over the Liberals and\r\nNationalists combined. The Liberal Unionists returned 71 members, and\r\nto cement yet more closely the Conservative-Unionist alliance Lord\r\nSalisbury made up a ministry in which the Unionist elements were ably\r\nrepresented by Joseph Chamberlain as Colonial Secretary, Viscount\r\nGoschen as First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Duke of Devonshire as\r\nPresident of the Council. The premier himself returned to the post of\r\nForeign Secretary, and his nephew, Arthur J. Balfour, now become again\r\nGovernment leader in the Commons, to that of First Lord of the\r\nTreasury. The accession of the third Salisbury ministry marked the\r\nbeginning of a Unionist ascendancy which lasted uninterruptedly a full\r\ndecade. In 1902 Lord Salisbury, whose fourth ministry, dating from the\r\nelections of 1900, was continuous with his third, retired from public\r\nlife, but he was succeeded in the premiership by Mr. Balfour, and the\r\npersonnel and policies of the Government continued otherwise\r\nunchanged.[218]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 218: The most useful works on the party\r\n                   history of the period 1874-1895 are Paul, History\r\n                   of Modern England, vols. 4-5, and Morley, Life of\r\n                   W.

Unionist Imperialism: the Elections of 1900.*--During the larger\r\npart of this Unionist decade the Liberal party, rent by factional\r\ndisputes and personal rivalries, afforded but ineffective opposition.[219]\r\nThe Home Rule question fell into the background; and although      (p. 154)\r\nthe Unionists carried through a considerable amount of social and\r\nindustrial legislation, the interests of the period center largely in\r\nthe Government's policies and achievements within the domain of\r\nforeign and colonial affairs. The most hotly contested issue of the\r\ndecade was imperialism; the most commanding public figure was Joseph\r\nChamberlain; the most notable enterprise undertaken was the war in\r\nSouth Africa. In 1900 it was resolved by the ministerial leaders to\r\ntake advantage of the public spirit engendered by the war to procure\r\nfor the Unionists a fresh lease of power. Parliament was dissolved\r\nand, on the eve of the announcement of the annexation of the\r\nTransvaal, a general election was held. The Liberals, led since early\r\nin 1899 by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, charged the Unionists with\r\nneglect of social and industrial matters, pledged themselves to\r\neducational, housing, and temperance reform, and sought especially to\r\nconvince the electorate that they might be intrusted with safety to\r\ndefend the legitimate interests of the Empire. The Government forced\r\nthe fight upon the issue of South African policy almost exclusively,\r\nand, representing the opposition as \"Little-Englanders,\" went before\r\nthe people with the argument that from the course that had been\r\nentered upon in South Africa there could be no turning back, and that\r\nthe present ministry was entitled to an opportunity to carry to\r\ncompletion the work that it had begun. The appeal was altogether\r\nsuccessful. The Conservatives obtained 334 seats and the Liberal\r\nUnionists 68--a total of 402; while the Liberals and Laborites carried\r\nbut 186 and the Nationalists 82--a total of 268. The Government\r\nmajority in the new parliament was thus 134, almost precisely that of\r\n1895.[220]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 219: The two principal aspirants to the\r\n                   Gladstonian succession were Lord Rosebery and Sir\r\n                   William Vernon-Harcourt. Rosebery represented the\r\n                   imperialistic element of Liberalism and advocated a\r\n                   return of the party to the general position which\r\n                   it had occupied prior to the split on Home Rule.\r\n                   Harcourt and the majority of the party opposed\r\n                   imperialism and insisted upon attention rather to a\r\n                   programme of social reform. From Gladstone's\r\n                   retirement, in 1894, to 1896 leadership devolved\r\n                   upon Rosebery, but from 1896 to the beginning of\r\n                   1899 Harcourt was the nominal leader, although\r\n                   Rosebery, as a private member, continued hardly\r\n                   less influential than before.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 220: W. Clarke, The Decline in English\r\n                   Liberalism, in _Political Science Quarterly_,\r\n                   Sept., 1901; P. Hamelle, Les élections anglaises,\r\n                   in _Annales des Sciences Politiques_, Nov., 1900.]\r\n\r\nAfter the elections dissension within the Liberal ranks broke out\r\nafresh. The Rosebery wing maintained that, the South African war\r\nhaving been begun, it was the duty of all Englishmen to support it,\r\nand that the Unionist government should be attacked only on the ground\r\nof mismanagement. In July, 1901, Campbell-Bannerman, impelled by the\r\nweakness of his position, demanded of his fellow-partisans that they\r\neither ratify or repudiate his leadership of the party in the      (p. 155)\r\nCommons. Approval was accorded, but no progress was realized toward an\r\nagreement upon policies. To careful observers it became clear that\r\nthere could be no effective revival of Liberalism until the war in\r\nSouth Africa should have been terminated and the larger imperial\r\nproblems involved in it solved. For a time the only clear-cut\r\nparliamentary opposition offered the Government was that of the\r\nfrankly pro-Boer Nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE LIBERAL REVIVAL\r\n\r\n*163. The Issue of Tariff Reform.*--The rehabilitation of the Liberal\r\nparty came during the years 1902-1905. It was foreshadowed by the\r\nfamous Chesterfield speech of Lord Rosebery, delivered December 16,\r\n1901, although the immediate effect of that effort was but to\r\naccentuate party cleavages,[221] and it was made possible by a\r\nreversion of the national mind from the war to domestic questions and\r\ninterests. More specifically, it was the product of opposition to the\r\nGovernment's Education Act of 1902, of public disapproval of what\r\nseemed to be the growing arrogance of the Unionist majority in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and, above all, of the demoralization which was\r\nwrought within the ranks of Unionism by the rise of the issue of\r\npreferential tariffs. In a speech to his constituents at Birmingham,\r\nMay 15, 1903, Mr. Chamberlain, but lately returned from a visit to\r\nSouth Africa and now at the height of his prestige, startled the\r\nnation by declaring that the time had come for Great Britain to\r\nabandon the free trade doctrines of the Manchester school and to knit\r\nthe Empire more closely together, and at the same time to promote the\r\neconomic interests of both the colonies and the mother country, by the\r\nadoption of a system of preferential duties on imported foodstuffs.\r\nLater in the year the gifted exponent of this revolutionary programme\r\nentered upon a vigorous speaking campaign in defense of his proposals,\r\nand there was set up a large and representative tariff commission\r\nwhich was charged with the task of framing, after due investigation, a\r\ntariff system which would meet the needs alleged to exist. Among the\r\nUnionist leaders there arose forthwith a division of opinion which\r\nportended open rupture. The rank and file of the party was         (p. 156)\r\nnonplussed and undecided, and throughout many months the subject\r\nengrossed attention to the exclusion of very nearly everything\r\nelse.[222]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 221: In this speech, delivered at a great\r\n                   Liberal meeting, there was outlined a programme\r\n                   upon which Rosebery virtually offered to resume the\r\n                   leadership of his party. The question of Boer\r\n                   independence was recognized as settled, but\r\n                   leniency toward the defeated people was advocated.\r\n                   It was maintained that at the close of the war\r\n                   there should be another general election. And the\r\n                   overhauling of the army, of the navy, of the\r\n                   educational system, and of the public finances, was\r\n                   marked out as an issue upon which the Liberals must\r\n                   take an unequivocal stand, as also temperance\r\n                   reform and legislation upon the housing of the\r\n                   poor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 222: The literature of the Tariff Reform\r\n                   movement in Great Britain is voluminous. The nature\r\n                   of the protectionist proposals may be studied at\r\n                   first hand in J. Chamberlain, Imperial Union and\r\n                   Tariff Reform; speeches delivered from May 15 to\r\n                   November 4, 1903 (London, 1903).

Price, An Economic\r\n                   View of Mr. Chamberlain's Proposals, in _Economic\r\n                   Review_, April, 1904. A useful work is S. H. Jeyes,\r\n                   Life of Joseph Chamberlain, 2 vols. (London,\r\n                   1903).]\r\n\r\nIn this situation the Liberals found their opportunity. All but\r\nunanimously opposed to the suggested departure, they assumed with\r\navidity the rôle of defenders of England's \"sacred principle of free\r\ntrade\" and utilized to the utmost the appeal which could now be made\r\nto the working classes in behalf of cheap bread. Mr. Chamberlain\r\ndenied that his scheme meant a wholesale reversal of the economic\r\npolicy of the nation, but in the judgment of most men the issue was\r\njoined squarely between the general principle of free trade and that\r\nof protection. Throughout 1904 and 1905 the Government found itself\r\nincreasingly embarrassed by the fiscal question, as well as by\r\ndifficulties attending the administration of the Education Act, the\r\nregulation of Chinese labor in South Africa, and a number of other\r\nurgent tasks, and the by-elections resulted so uniformly in Unionist\r\ndefeats as to presage clearly the eventual return of the Liberals to\r\npower.\r\n\r\n*164. The Liberals in Office: the Elections of 1906.*--Hesitating long,\r\nbut at the last bowing somewhat abruptly before the gathering storm,\r\nMr. Balfour tendered his resignation December 4, 1905. The Government\r\nhad in the Commons a working majority of seventy-six, and the\r\nParliament elected in 1900 had still another year of life. In the\r\nLords the Unionists outnumbered their opponents ten to one. The\r\nadministration, however, had fallen off enormously in popularity, and\r\nthe obstacles imposed by the fiscal cleavage appeared insuperable.\r\nUnable wholly to follow Mr. Chamberlain in his projects, the premier\r\nhad grown weary of the attempt to balance himself on the tight rope of\r\nambiguity between the free trade and protectionist wings of his party.\r\nNot caring, however, to give his opponents the advantage which would\r\naccrue from an immediate dissolution of Parliament and the ordering of\r\nan election which should turn on clear issues raised by the record of\r\nthe ten years of Unionist rule, he chose simply to resign and so to\r\ncompel the formation of a new government which itself should be    (p. 157)\r\nimmediately on trial when the inevitable elections should come.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Mr. Balfour's resignation the king designated as premier\r\nthe Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who forthwith made\r\nup a cabinet of rather exceptional strength in which the premier\r\nhimself occupied the post of First Lord of the Treasury, Sir Edward\r\nGrey that of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Herbert H. Asquith that of the\r\nExchequer, Mr. Richard B. Haldane that of War, Lord Tweedmouth that of\r\nthe Navy, Mr. David Lloyd-George that of President of the Board of\r\nTrade, Mr. John Burns that of President of the Local Government Board,\r\nMr. Augustine Birrell that of President of the Board of Education, and\r\nMr. James Bryce that of Chief Secretary for Ireland. January 8, 1906,\r\nthe \"Khaki Parliament\" was dissolved, a general election was ordered,\r\nand the new parliament was fixed to meet at the earliest legal date,\r\nFebruary 13. The campaign that followed was the most animated, except\r\nthat of 1910, in recent British history. The Unionists, being\r\nthemselves divided beyond repair on the question of the tariff, pinned\r\ntheir hope to a disruption of the Liberal forces on the issue of Home\r\nRule. The Liberal leaders, however, steadfastly refused to allow the\r\nIrish question to be brought into the foreground. Recognizing that\r\nHome Rule in the immediate future was an impossibility, but pledging\r\nthemselves to a policy contemplating its establishment by degrees,\r\nthey contrived to force the battle principally upon the issue of free\r\ntrade _versus_ protection and, in general, to direct their most\r\ntelling attack upon the fiscal record and fiscal policies of their\r\nopponents. The result was an overwhelming Liberal triumph. In a total\r\nof 6,555,301 votes,[223] 4,026,704 were cast for Liberal, Nationalist,\r\nand Labor candidates, and only 2,528,597 for Conservatives and\r\nUnionists. There were returned to the House of Commons 374 Liberals,\r\n84 Nationalists, 54 Laborites, 131 Conservatives, and 27 Liberal\r\nUnionists, assuring the Liberals and their allies a clear\r\npreponderance of 354.[224] Prior to the elections careful observers\r\nbelieved the return of the Liberals to power inevitable, but a victory\r\nof such proportions was not dreamed of by the most ardent of the\r\nparty's well-wishers.[225]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 223: The number of electors in the United\r\n                   Kingdom in 1906 was 7,266,708.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 224: Of the Opposition 102 were Tariff\r\n                   Reformers of the Chamberlain school, while but 16\r\n                   were thoroughgoing \"Free Fooders.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 225: M.

THE RULE OF THE LIBERALS, 1906-1912                            (p. 158)\r\n\r\n*165. The Liberal Mandate.*--The Liberal ascendancy, made thus secure by\r\nthe elections of 1906, has continued uninterruptedly to the date of\r\nwriting (1912), and the years covered by it have been in many respects\r\nthe most important in the political history of modern Britain. The\r\nsignificance of the period arises principally from the vast amount of\r\nsocial and economic legislation that has been attempted within it. A\r\nconsiderable portion of this legislation has been successfully carried\r\nthrough and is now in effect. Some important portions, however, have\r\nfailed of eventual adoption, chiefly in consequence of the opposition\r\nof the Unionist majority in the Lords; and a direct outcome of the\r\nseries of clashes between the Liberals and the Lords has been the\r\nimportant constitutional readjustments comprised within the Parliament\r\nAct of 1911 already described. Speaking broadly, the Liberals were\r\nrestored to power in 1906 because the nation desired the doing of\r\ncertain things which the Unionists seemed unable or disinclined to do.\r\nMost important among these things were: (1) the reduction of public\r\nexpenditures and the curbing of national extravagance; (2) the\r\nremission of taxation imposed during the South African war; (3) the\r\nreform of the army; and (4) the undertaking of an extended programme\r\nof social reform, embracing the establishment of old age pensions, the\r\nremedying of unemployment, the regulation of the liquor traffic, and\r\nthe liberation of education from ecclesiastical domination. The nation\r\nwas solicitous, too, that the system of free trade be maintained\r\nwithout impairment. To all of these policies, and more, the Liberals\r\nwere committed without reserve when they entered office.\r\n\r\n*166. The Party's Performance.*--During the years intervening between\r\nthe elections of 1906 and those of 1910 the Liberal governments\r\npresided over successively by Mr. Campbell-Bannerman and Mr.\r\nAsquith[226] made honest effort to redeem the election pledges of the\r\nparty. They stopped the alarming increase of the national debt and\r\nmade provision for debt reduction at a rate equalled at but two brief\r\nperiods since the middle of the nineteenth century. They repealed\r\napproximately half of the war taxes which were still operative when\r\nthey assumed office. In the matter of national expenditures they\r\naccomplished a momentary reduction, although the normal increase   (p. 159)\r\nof civil outlays, the adoption of old age pensions, and, above all,\r\nthe demand of the propertied interests for the maintenance of a\r\ntwo-power naval standard brought about eventually an increase rather\r\nthan a diminution of the sums carried by the annual budget. In\r\naccordance with a scheme worked out by Mr. Haldane they remodelled the\r\narmy. They maintained free trade. They made no headway toward Home\r\nRule, but they enacted, in 1909, an Irish Universities bill and an\r\nIrish Land Purchase bill which were regarded as highly favorable to\r\nIrish interests. Above all, they labored to meet the demand of the\r\nnation for social legislation. The prevalence of unemployment, the\r\nmisery occasioned by widespread poverty, the recurrence of strikes and\r\nother industrial disorders, the growing volume of emigration, and\r\nother related aspects of England's present social unsettlement, have\r\nserved to fix unshakably in the public mind the idea that the state\r\nmust plan, undertake, and bear the cost of huge projects of social and\r\nindustrial amelioration and of democratization and reform. In the\r\nrealization of those portions of their programme which relate to these\r\nmatters the Liberals have been only partially successful. They enacted\r\nimportant labor legislation, including an eight-hour working day in\r\nmines, a Labor Exchanges act, and a Trades Disputes act, and they\r\nestablished, by act of 1908, an elaborate system of old age pensions.\r\nBy reason of the opposition of the House of Lords, however, they\r\nfailed to enact the bill of 1906 for the abolition of plural\r\nvoting, the hotly contested measure of 1906 providing for the\r\nundenominationalizing of the schools, the Aliens Bill of 1906, the\r\nLand Values Bill of 1907, the Licensing Bill of 1908, the London\r\nElections Bill of 1909, and, finally, the Finance Bill of 1909, whose\r\nrejection by the Lords precipitated a dissolution of Parliament and\r\nthe ordering of the elections of January, 1910.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 226: Mr. Campbell-Bannerman resigned\r\n                   April 5, 1908. His successor was Mr. Asquith, late\r\n                   Chancellor of the Exchequer. Most of the ministers\r\n                   were continued in their respective offices, but Mr.\r\n                   Lloyd-George became Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\n                   Mr. Winston Churchill President of the Board of\r\n                   Trade, Lord Tweedmouth President of the Council,\r\n                   and the Earl of Crewe Secretary of State for the\r\n                   Colonies.]\r\n\r\n*167. The Liberals Versus the Lords: the Elections of January,\r\n1910.*--Four years of conflict with the overpowering Opposition in the\r\nupper chamber brought the Liberals to a place from which they neither\r\ncould nor would go on until certain fundamentals were settled. The\r\nfirst was the assurance of revenues adequate to meet the growing\r\ndemands upon the treasury. The second was the alteration of the status\r\nof the Lords to make certain the predominance of the popular branch of\r\nParliament in finance and legislation. During the two years\r\n(1909-1911) while these great issues were pending the nation was\r\nstirred to the depths and party conflict was unprecedented in\r\nintensity. On the side of finance, Unionists and Liberals were in\r\nsubstantial agreement upon the policies--especially old age pensions\r\nand naval aggrandizement--which rendered larger outlays inevitable;\r\nthey differed, rather, upon the means by which the necessary funds (p. 160)\r\nshould be obtained. The solution offered in the Lloyd-George budget of\r\n1909 was the imposition of new taxes on land and the increase of\r\nliquor license duties and of the taxes on incomes and inheritances.\r\nThe new burdens were contrived to fall almost wholly upon the\r\npropertied, especially the landholding, classes. To this plan the\r\nUnionists offered the alternative of Tariff Reform, urging that the\r\nneeded revenues should be derived from duties laid principally upon\r\nimported foodstuffs, although the free trade members of the party\r\ncould not with consistency lend this proposal their support. The\r\nrejection of the Finance Bill by the Lords, November 30, 1909,\r\nsweeping aside as it did three centuries of unbroken precedent,\r\nbrought to a crisis the question of the mending or ending of the\r\nLords, and although the electoral contest of January, 1910, was fought\r\nimmediately upon the issue of the Government's finance proposals, the\r\nquestion of the Lords could by no means be kept in the background. The\r\nresults of this election were disappointing to all parties save the\r\nNationalists. The final returns gave the Liberals 274 seats, the\r\nUnionists 273, the Nationalists 82, and the Laborites 41. The Asquith\r\ngovernment found itself still in power, but absolutely dependent upon\r\nthe co-operation of the Labor and Nationalist groups. Upon the great\r\nissues involved there was no very clear pronouncement, but it was a\r\nforegone conclusion that the tax proposals would be enacted, that some\r\nreconstitution of the House of Lords would be undertaken, and that\r\nfree trade would not yet be in any measure abandoned.[227]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 227: R.

The Liberal Triumph: the Elections of December, 1910.*--The\r\ndevelopments of the ensuing year and a half have been sketched\r\nelsewhere.[228] They comprised, in the main: (1) the re-introduction\r\nand the enactment of the Finance Bill of 1909: (2) the bringing\r\nforward by Mr. Asquith of the Government's proposals relative to   (p. 161)\r\nthe alteration of relations between the two houses of Parliament; (3)\r\nthe adoption by the House of Lords of the principle of Lord Rosebery's\r\nprojected scheme of upper chamber reform; (4) the interruption and\r\npostponement of the contest by reason of the death of Edward VII.; (5)\r\nthe failure of the Constitutional Conference in the summer of 1910;\r\n(6) the adoption by the second chamber of the reform resolutions of\r\nLord Lansdowne; (7) the dissolution of Parliament, after an existence\r\nof but ten months, to afford an opportunity for a fresh appeal to the\r\ncountry on the specific issue of second chamber reform; (8) the\r\nelections of December, 1910, and the assembling of the new parliament\r\nin January, 1911; and (9) the re-introduction and the final enactment,\r\nin the summer of 1911, of the Government's momentous Parliament Bill.\r\nAt the December elections the contending forces were so solidly\r\nentrenched that the party quotas in the House of Commons remained all\r\nbut unchanged. Following the elections they stood as follows:\r\nLiberals, 272; Unionists, 272; Nationalists, 76; Independent\r\nNationalists (followers of William O'Brien), 8; and Laborites, 42. The\r\nUnionists gained substantially in Lancashire, Devonshire, and\r\nCornwall, but lost ground in London and in several boroughs throughout\r\nthe country. Still dependent upon the good-will of the minor parties,\r\nthe Government addressed itself afresh to the limitation of the veto\r\npower of the Lords and to the programme of social amelioration which\r\nduring the recent months of excitement had been accorded meager\r\nattention. Effort in the one direction bore fruit in the Parliament\r\nAct, approved by the crown August 18, 1911; while upon the other side\r\nsubstantial results were achieved in the enactment, December 16, 1911,\r\nof a far-reaching measure instituting a national system of insurance\r\nagainst both sickness and unemployment.[229]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 228: See pp. 108-111.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 229: On the elections of December, 1910,\r\n                   see P.

THE PARTIES OF TO-DAY                                         (p. 162)\r\n\r\n*169. Significance of \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative.\"*--Of the four\r\npolitical parties of Great Britain to-day one, the Irish Nationalist,\r\nis localized in Ireland and has for its essential purpose the\r\nattainment of the single end of Irish Home Rule;[230] another, the\r\nLabor party, is composed all but exclusively of workingmen, mainly\r\nmembers of trade-unions, and exists to promote the interests of the\r\nlaboring masses; while the two older and more powerful ones, the\r\nLiberal and the Conservative or Unionist, are broadly national in\r\ntheir constituencies and well-nigh universal in the range of their\r\nprinciples and policies. It is essential to observe, however, that\r\nwhile the programme of the Nationalists is, at least to a certain\r\npoint, perfectly precise, and that of the Laborites is hardly less so,\r\nthere is no longer, despite the heat of recurring electoral and\r\nparliamentary combats, much that is fundamental or permanent in the\r\ndemarcation which sets off the two major parties the one against the\r\nother. Even the names \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative\" denote in reality\r\nmuch less than might be supposed. During the generation which began\r\nwith the Reform Act of 1832 the Liberals, indeed, extended the\r\nfranchise to the middle classes, reformed the poor law, overhauled the\r\ncriminal law, introduced a new and more satisfactory scheme of\r\nmunicipal administration, instituted public provision for elementary\r\neducation, enacted statutes to safeguard the public health, removed\r\nthe disabilities of dissenters, and assisted in the overthrow of the\r\nprotective system. But if the Conservatives of the period 1830-1870\r\nplayed, in general, the rôle implied by their party designation, their\r\nattitude none the less was by no means always that of obstructionists,\r\nand in the days of the Disraelian leadership they became scarcely less\r\na party of reform than were their opponents. Beginning with the Reform\r\nAct of 1867, a long list of progressive and even revolutionizing\r\nmeasures must be credited to them, and in late years they and the\r\nLiberals have vied in advocating old age pensions, factory\r\nlegislation, accident insurance, housing laws, and other sorts of\r\nadvanced and remedial governmental action. The differences which\r\nseparate the two parties are not so much those of principle or of  (p. 163)\r\npolitical dogma as those of policy respecting immediate and particular\r\nmeasures, and especially those of attitude toward certain important\r\norganizations and interests. The Liberals assert themselves to be more\r\ntrustful of the people and more concerned about the popular welfare,\r\nbut the Conservatives enter a denial which possesses plausibility. It\r\nis probably true that the Liberals have fostered peace and economy\r\nwith more resoluteness than have their rivals, yet so far as\r\nexpenditures go the Liberal administration to-day is laying out more\r\nmoney than was ever laid out by a Conservative government in time of\r\npeace. The Liberals are seemingly more regardful of the interests of\r\nScotland, Wales, and Ireland, but the difference is not so large as is\r\nsometimes supposed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 230: A recent and important work on party\r\n                   history is F.

Present-day Issues.*--Aside from the tariff question (and the\r\nConservatives are far from united upon the Chamberlain programme), the\r\nprincipal issues which separate the two leading parties to-day are\r\nthose which arise from the Conservative attitude of friendliness\r\ntoward the House of Lords, the Established Church, the landowners, and\r\nthe publicans. Most of the political contests of recent years have\r\nbeen waged upon questions pertaining to the constitution of the upper\r\nchamber, denominational control of education, disestablishment, the\r\ntaxation of land, and the regulation of the liquor traffic, and in all\r\nof these matters the Liberals have been insisting upon changes which\r\ntheir opponents either disapprove entirely or desire to confine within\r\nnarrower bounds than those proposed. In the carrying through of the\r\nParliament Bill of 1911, providing a means by which measures may be\r\nenacted into law over the protest of the Conservative majority in the\r\nLords, the Liberals achieved their greatest triumph since 1832. The\r\nparty stands committed to-day to a large number of far-reaching\r\nprojects, including the extension of social insurance, the revision of\r\nthe electoral system, the establishment of Home Rule, and, ultimately,\r\na reconstitution of the second chamber as promised in the preamble of\r\nthe Parliament Act. At the date of writing (October, 1912) there are\r\npending in Parliament a momentous measure for the granting of Home\r\nRule to Ireland[231] and another for the overhauling of the electoral\r\nsystem,[232] an important bill for the disestablishment of the Church\r\nin Wales, a measure virtually annulling the principle involved in the\r\nOsborne Decision,[233] and several minor Government proposals. The\r\nrecent victories of the Liberals have been won with the aid of Labor\r\nand Irish Nationalist votes, and the concessions which have been,  (p. 164)\r\nand are being, made to the interests of these auxiliary parties may be\r\nexpected to affect profoundly the course of legislation during the\r\ncontinuance of the Liberal ascendancy.[234] There are, it may be said,\r\nindications that the Liberals possess less strength throughout the\r\ncountry than they exhibited during the critical years 1910-1911. At\r\nthirty-eight by-elections contested by the Unionists since December,\r\n1910, the Liberals have suffered a net loss of eight seats; and one of\r\nthe contests lost was that in Midlothian, long the constituency\r\nrepresented by Gladstone, which returned, in September, 1912, a\r\nConservative member for the first time in thirty-eight years. There is\r\na tradition that when a Liberal government is defeated in Midlothian\r\nthe end of that government is not far distant. Prophecy in such\r\nmatters, however, is futile. Meanwhile the Unionists continue to be\r\ndivided upon the tariff, but in the main they are united in opposition\r\nto the overturning of the ancient constitutional system, although they\r\nno longer generally oppose a moderate reform of the House of Lords. In\r\na speech delivered at Leeds, November 16, 1911, the new parliamentary\r\nleader of the party, Mr. Bonar Law,[235] enumerated as the immediate\r\nUnionist purposes (1) to oppose the Government's Welsh Disestablishment\r\nscheme, (2) to resist Home Rule, (3) to labor for tariff reform as the\r\nonly practicable means of solving the problem of unemployment, and (4)\r\nto defend at all costs the unity of the Empire.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 231: W.

Party Composition.*--Both of the great parties as constituted\r\nto-day possess substantial strength in all portions of the kingdom\r\nsave Ireland, the Liberals being in the preponderance in Scotland,\r\nWales, and northern England, and the Conservatives in the south and\r\nsouthwest. Within the Conservative ranks are found much the greater\r\nportion of the people of title, wealth, and social position; nearly\r\nall of the clergy of the Established Church, and some of the\r\nDissenters; a majority of the graduates of the universities[236] and\r\nof members of the bar; most of the prosperous merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and financiers; a majority of clerks and approximately\r\nhalf of the tradesmen and shopkeepers; and a very considerable mass,\r\nthough not in these days half, of the workingmen. During the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century the well-to-do and aristocratic     (p. 165)\r\nWhig element in the Liberal party was drawn over, in the main, to the\r\nranks of the Conservatives,[237] and to this day the Liberal party\r\ncontains but a small proportion of the rank and wealth of the kingdom.\r\nIt is pre-eminently an organization of the middle and popular classes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 236: At the election of 1906, 21,505 of\r\n                   the 25,771 votes recorded in the university\r\n                   constituencies were cast for Unionist candidates.\r\n                   Since 1885 not a Liberal member has been returned\r\n                   from any one of the universities.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 237: The defection was largest at the\r\n                   time of the Liberal Unionist secession in 1886.]\r\n\r\n*172. The Independent Labor Party.*--The Labor party of the present day\r\nis the product largely of the twin agencies of socialism and\r\ntrade-unionism. As early as 1868 two persons sought seats in\r\nParliament as representatives of labor, and at the elections of 1874\r\nthere were no fewer than thirteen labor candidates, two of whom were\r\nsuccessful. Great industrial upheavals of succeeding years, notably\r\nthe strike of the London dock laborers in 1889, together with the rise\r\nof new organizations composed of unskilled labor and pronouncedly\r\ninfected with socialism, created demand for the interference of the\r\nstate for the improvement of labor conditions and led eventually to\r\nthe organization of the Independent Labor Party in 1893. The aim of\r\nthis party as set forth in its constitution and rules is essentially\r\nsocialistic, namely, \"the establishment of collective ownership and\r\ncontrol of the means of production, distribution, and exchange\"; and\r\nthe working programme as originally announced includes (1) a universal\r\neight-hour day, (2) the abolition of over-time, piece-work, and the\r\nemployment of children under fourteen, (3) state provision for the\r\nill, the invalid, and the aged, (4) free, non-sectarian education of\r\nall grades, (5) the extinction by taxation of unearned incomes, and\r\n(6) universal disarmament. To this programme has been added woman's\r\nsuffrage, a second ballot in parliamentary elections, municipal\r\ncontrol of the liquor traffic and of hospitals, and a number of other\r\nproposed innovations. At the elections of 1895 the party named\r\ntwenty-eight candidates, but no one of them was successful and Keir\r\nHardie, founder and president, lost the seat which he had occupied\r\nsince 1892. In 1900 it attained, in the re-election of Hardie, its\r\nfirst parliamentary victory, and in 1906 when the tide of radicalism\r\nwas running high seven of its candidates and sixteen of its members\r\nwere elected to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n*173. The Labor Party To-day.*--The Independent Labor Party has been\r\nthroughout its history avowedly socialistic. It has sought and\r\nobtained the adherence of thousands of laboring men, some of whom are,\r\nand some of whom are not, socialists. But its character is too radical\r\nto attract the mass of trade-union members and alongside it there has\r\ngrown up a larger and broader organization known simply as the Labor\r\nParty. A trade-union congress held at London in September, 1899,   (p. 166)\r\ncaused to be brought together an assemblage of representatives of all\r\nco-operative, trade-union, socialist, and working-class organizations\r\nwhich were willing to share in an effort to increase the representation\r\nof labor in Parliament. This body held its first meeting at London in\r\nFebruary, 1900, and an organization was formed in which the ruling\r\nforces were the politically inclined but non-socialistic trade-unions.\r\nThe object of the affiliation was asserted to be \"to establish a\r\ndistinct labor group in Parliament, who shall have their own whips,\r\nand agree upon their own policy, which must embrace a readiness to\r\nco-operate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in\r\npromoting legislation in the direct interest of labor.\" The growth of\r\nthe organization was rapid, and in 1906 the name which had been\r\nemployed, i.e., Labor Representation Committee, gave place to that of\r\nLabor Party. At the elections of 1906 twenty-nine of the fifty-one\r\ncandidates of this party were chosen to the House of Commons. Taking\r\ninto account eleven members connected with miners' organizations and\r\nfourteen others who were Independent Laborites or Liberal Laborites\r\n(\"Lib.-Labs.\"), the parliament chosen in 1906 contained a labor\r\ncontingent aggregating fifty-four members. Since 1908 there has been\r\nin progress a consolidation of the labor forces represented at\r\nWestminster and, although at the elections of 1910 some seats were\r\nlost, there are in the House of Commons to-day forty-two labor\r\nrepresentatives. The entire group is independent of, but friendly\r\ntoward, the Liberal Government; and since the Liberals stand in\r\nconstant need of Labor support, its power in legislation is altogether\r\ndisproportioned to its numbers.[238]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 238: Two satisfactory volumes on the\r\n                   political activities of labor in the United Kingdom\r\n                   are C.

ENGLISH LAW\r\n\r\nThe preponderating principle in the governmental system of Great\r\nBritain to-day is the rule of law, which means, in effect, two things:\r\nfirst, that no man may be deprived of liberty or property save on\r\naccount of a breach of the law proved in one of the ordinary courts\r\nand, second, that no man stands above the law and that for every\r\nviolation of the law some reparation may be obtained, whatever the\r\nstation or character of the offender.[239] Upon these fundamental\r\nguarantees has been erected through the centuries a fabric of personal\r\nliberty which lends the British nation one of its principal\r\ndistinctions. The influence of English concepts and forms of law has\r\ncounted for much, furthermore, in the shaping of continental legal\r\nsystems; and outside of Europe, and especially in the English-speaking\r\ncountries of both hemispheres, the law of England has been, within\r\nmodern times, much the most universal and decisive formative agency in\r\nlegal development.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 239: The only exception to this general\r\n                   proposition is afforded by the fact that the\r\n                   sovereign may not be sued or prosecuted in the\r\n                   ordinary courts; but this immunity, as matters now\r\n                   stand, is of no practical consequence.]\r\n\r\n*174. Statute Law and Common Law.*--From at least the seventeenth\r\ncentury law has been conceived of in England as exclusively the body\r\nof rules, of whatsoever origin or nature, which can be enforced in the\r\nregular courts. As it has taken form, it falls into two principal\r\ncategories. The one is statute law, the other is the Common Law.\r\nStatute law consists of specific acts of Parliament, supplemented by\r\nby-laws, rules, and regulations made under parliamentary sanction by\r\npublic officials and bodies. Chronologically, it begins in 1235, in\r\nthe reign of Henry III.; and inasmuch as it is amended and amplified\r\nat substantially every parliamentary session, the bulk of it has come\r\nto be enormous. The more comprehensive and fundamental part of English\r\nlaw, however, is, and has always been, the Common Law. The Common Law\r\nis a product of growth rather than of legislation. No definite time\r\ncan be assigned for its beginning, for at as early a period as     (p. 168)\r\nthere are reports of judicial decisions the existence of a body of\r\nlaw not emanating from law-makers was taken for granted. Long before\r\nthe close of the Middle Ages the essentials of the Common Law had\r\nacquired not only unquestioned sanction but also thoroughgoing\r\ncoherence and uniformity. Despite the greatly increased legislative\r\nactivity of modern times, it still may be said that the rules of the\r\nCommon Law are fundamental, the laws of Parliament but incidental.\r\nStatutes regularly assume the principles of the Common Law, and are\r\nlargely, as one writer has put it, \"the addenda and errata\" of this\r\nlaw, incomplete and meaningless save in co-ordination with the legal\r\norder by which they are supported and enveloped.[240] Thus no act of\r\nParliament enjoins in general terms that a man shall pay his debts, or\r\nfulfill his contracts, or pay damages for trespass or slander.\r\nStatutes define the _modes_ in accordance with which these obligations\r\nshall be met, but the obligations themselves are derived entirely from\r\nthe Common Law. It is, however, a fixed rule that where statutes fall\r\nin conflict with the Common Law it is the statutes that prevail. The\r\nlimitless competence of Parliament involves the power to set aside or\r\nto modify at any time any Common Law principle or practice, while, on\r\nthe other hand, no development of the Common Law can repeal an act of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 240: W. M. Geldart, Elements of English\r\n                   Law (London and New York, 1912), 9. As this author\r\n                   further remarks, \"if all the statutes of the realm\r\n                   were repealed, we should have a system of law,\r\n                   though, it may be, an unworkable one; if we could\r\n                   imagine the Common Law swept away and the Statute\r\n                   Law preserved, we should have only disjointed rules\r\n                   torn from their context, and no provision at all\r\n                   for many of the most important relations of life.\"]\r\n\r\n*175. The Form of the Law.*--Statute law takes invariably, of course,\r\nwritten form. The acts of Parliament are to be found in imposing\r\nprinted collections, to which a substantial volume is added every\r\nyear. Of the Common Law, however, there is no single or authoritative\r\ntext. The Common Law grew up originally as unwritten law, and in a\r\nlarge measure it preserves still that character. The sources, however,\r\nfrom which knowledge of it must be drawn are mainly in writing or in\r\nprint. The most important are (1) the decisions of the judges of the\r\nEnglish courts (reported anonymously in Year Books from the reign of\r\nEdward I. to that of Henry VIII., and thereafter by lawyers reporting\r\nunder their own names) which from at least the sixteenth century\r\nacquired weight as precedents and are nowadays all but absolutely\r\ndecisive in analogous cases; (2) the decisions of courts of other\r\ncountries in which there is administered a law derived from the English,\r\nsuch decisions being, of course, not binding, yet highly influential;\r\nand (3) certain \"books of authority\" written by learned lawyers    (p. 169)\r\nof earlier times, such as Coke's seventeenth-century Commentary on\r\nLittleton's Tenures and Foster's eighteenth-century treatise on Crown\r\nLaw. Some small branches of the Common Law have, indeed, been codified\r\nin the form of statutes, among them the law of partnership, that of\r\nsales, and that of bills of exchange.\r\n\r\n*176. The Rules of Equity.*--There is one other body of English law\r\nwhich requires mention, namely, the rules of equity. These rules had\r\ntheir origin in the administration of an extraordinary sort of justice\r\nby the king's chancellor in mediæval times, a practice which arose\r\nfrom the sheer necessity of redressing grievances occasioned by the\r\nomissions or commissions of the regularly constituted tribunals.\r\nInterference on the part of the chancellor, which started as a matter\r\nof special favor in unusual cases, became gradually an established\r\npractice, and, contrary to the original intention, there was brought\r\ninto existence a body of definite and separate rules of equity which\r\nby the seventeenth century acquired systematic character, and likewise\r\na court of chancery in which these rules were at all times\r\nenforceable. Reports of equity cases became continuous, and lawyers of\r\neminence began to specialize in equity procedure. The rules of equity\r\nthus developed partake largely of the nature of the Common Law, of\r\nwhich, indeed, they are to be considered, in effect, a supplement or\r\nappendix; and practically, though not theoretically, they prevail as\r\nagainst any provisions of the ordinary Common Law with which they may\r\nbe inconsistent. Their general purpose is to afford means of\r\nsafeguarding rights which exist in morals, but which the Common Law\r\ncourts cannot or will not protect. Until 1875 they were administered\r\nby tribunals separate from the ordinary courts. Nowadays they are not\r\nseparately administered, but they preserve, none the less, their\r\nhighly distinctive character.[241]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 241: Two monumental works dealing with\r\n                   the earlier portions of English legal development\r\n                   are F.

P. Ilbert, Legislative\r\n                   Methods and Forms (Oxford, 1901), 1-76.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE INFERIOR COURTS                                            (p. 170)\r\n\r\n*177. The Hierarchy of Tribunals.*--In the majority of continental\r\ncountries a distinction is drawn between ordinary law and what is\r\nknown as administrative law, i.e., the body of rules governing the\r\nconduct of public officials and, more particularly, the adjudication\r\nof disputes between these officials, in their public capacity, and\r\nprivate citizens. This differentiation of law entails customarily the\r\nmaintenance of administrative courts, separate from the ordinary\r\ntribunals, in which administrative cases are heard and decided. In\r\nGreat Britain, however, there is no such thing as administrative law,\r\nand in consequence there is no need of administrative courts. Public\r\nofficials, from the ministers downwards, are amenable to the processes\r\nof the ordinary tribunals precisely as are all other classes of\r\npeople. Simpler, therefore, at this point than the continental systems\r\nof courts, the English system is none the less one of the most\r\nelaborate and complicated in the world. There are features of it which\r\nin origin are mediæval, others which owe their existence to the\r\nreforming enterprises of the earlier nineteenth century, and still\r\nothers which have a history covering hardly more than a generation.\r\nReduced to its simplest aspect, the system comprises, at the bottom,\r\nthree principal varieties of tribunals--the county courts for civil\r\ncases and the courts of the justices of the peace and the borough\r\ncriminal courts for criminal cases--and, at the top, a Supreme Court\r\nof Judicature in two branches, i.e., the High Court of Justice and\r\nthe Court of Appeal, in addition to the Judicial Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council, the House of Lords, and a number of other occasional or\r\nspecial central tribunals.[242]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 242: It should be noted that the judicial\r\n                   system herein to be described is that of England\r\n                   alone. The systems existing in Scotland and Ireland\r\n                   are at many points unlike it. In Scotland the\r\n                   distinction between law and equity is virtually\r\n                   unknown and the Common Law of England does not\r\n                   prevail. In Ireland, on the other hand, the Common\r\n                   Law is operative and judicial organization and\r\n                   procedure are roughly similar to the English.]\r\n\r\n*178. The County Courts.*--The county courts of the present day    (p. 171)\r\nwere established under provision of the County Court Act of 1846, and\r\nit is to be observed that they are in no manner connected with the\r\nhistoric courts of the shire or county. They are known as county\r\ncourts, but in point of fact the area of their jurisdiction is a\r\ndistrict which not only is smaller than the county but bears no\r\nrelation to it. There are in England at present some five hundred of\r\nthese districts, the object of the arrangement being to bring the\r\nagencies of justice close to the people and so to reduce the costs and\r\ndelays incident to litigation.[243] The volume of business to be\r\ntransacted in a district is insufficient to occupy a judge during any\r\nconsiderable portion of his working time, and the districts are\r\ngrouped in some fifty circuits, to each of which is assigned by the\r\nLord Chancellor one judge who holds court in each district of his\r\ncircuit approximately once a month. The judge sits almost invariably\r\nwithout a jury, although unless the amount involved is very small\r\neither party to a suit is privileged to request the employment of a\r\njury of eight persons. The jurisdiction of the county courts has been\r\nenlarged a number of times, notably by a statute of 1905, but it is\r\nstill not as extended as many people believe it should be. In a few\r\nmatters, such as certain claims of workingmen for injuries, this\r\njurisdiction is exclusive, but at most points it is concurrent with\r\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice, and Common Law, equity,\r\nbankruptcy, probate, and admiralty cases may be brought, at the\r\ndiscretion of the plaintiff, in either tribunal, subject to the\r\nrestriction that the county court may not assume jurisdiction when the\r\nvalue in dispute exceeds a certain amount, commonly £100 in Common Law\r\ncases and £500 in cases of equity. On all points of law appeal lies to\r\nthe High Court; but appeals are rare.[244]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 243: Prior to 1846 justice in civil cases\r\n                   could be obtained only at Westminster, or, in any\r\n                   event, by means of an action instituted at\r\n                   Westminster and tried on circuit.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 244: A few inferior civil courts of\r\n                   special character have survived from earlier days,\r\n                   but they are anomalous and do not call for comment.\r\n                   It may be added that the judges of the county\r\n                   courts receive a salary of £1,500.]\r\n\r\n*179. The Justices of the Peace.*--The county courts exist for the\r\nadjudication of civil cases exclusively. The corresponding local\r\ntribunals for the administration of criminal justice are the courts of\r\nthe justices of the peace, and, in certain towns, other courts to\r\nwhich the powers of the justices have been transferred. The county is\r\nnormally the area of the jurisdiction of the justices, and with a few\r\nexceptions every county has a separate \"commission of the peace,\"[245]\r\nconsisting of all the judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature, all\r\nmembers of the Privy Council, and such other persons as the crown, (p. 172)\r\nacting through the Lord Chancellor, may designate as justices on\r\nrecommendation of the Lord Lieutenant or independently.[246] The Lord\r\nLieutenant is chief of the justices and keeper of the county records.\r\nIn many counties the list of justices contains three or four hundred\r\nnames (in Lancashire eight hundred), but it is to be observed that\r\nsome of the appointees do not take the oaths required to qualify them\r\nfor magisterial service and that the actual work is performed in each\r\ncounty by a comparatively small number of persons. The justices serve\r\nwithout pay, but the office carries much local distinction and\r\nappointments are widely coveted. Until 1906 a property qualification[247]\r\nwas required of all save certain classes of appointees whose station\r\nwas deemed a sufficient guarantee of fitness, but in the year\r\nmentioned the Liberals brought about its abolition. The justices are\r\ndrawn still, in large part, from the class of country gentlemen. They\r\nare removable by the crown, but tenure is almost invariably for life.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 245: The three ridings of Yorkshire and\r\n                   the three divisions of Lincolnshire have separate\r\n                   commissions, and there are a few \"liberties\" or\r\n                   excepted jurisdictions.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 246: A royal commission created to\r\n                   consider the mode of appointment reported in 1910;\r\n                   but no important modification of the existing\r\n                   practice was suggested.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 247: Ownership of land, or occupation of\r\n                   a house, worth £100 a year.]\r\n\r\n*180. Powers of the Justices.*--At one time the functions of the\r\njustices of the peace were administrative as well as judicial, but by\r\nthe Local Government Act of 1888 functions of an administrative nature\r\nwere transferred all but completely to the newly created county\r\ncouncils,[248] and the justices to-day are judicial officials almost\r\nexclusively. Their judicial labors may be performed under three\r\nconditions, namely, by justices acting singly, by two or more justices\r\nmeeting in petty sessions, and by the whole body of justices of the\r\ncounty assembled in quarter sessions. The powers of a justice acting\r\nalone are those largely of the ordinary police magistrate. He may\r\norder the arrest of offenders; he conducts preliminary examinations\r\nand releases the accused or commits them for indictment by a grand\r\njury; and he hears cases involving unimportant breaches of the law and\r\nimposes small penalties. The justices sitting by twos in petty\r\nsessions exercise an extensive summary jurisdiction over offenses\r\nspecified minutely by the law.[249] They sit without a jury, but\r\nappeal can be carried, as a rule, to the justices at quarter sessions\r\nand even, on questions of law, to the High Court. Four times a year\r\nall of the justices of the county, or such of them as care to be\r\npresent, meet in quarter sessions. The jurisdiction here exercised is\r\nin part appellate and in part original. The court tries, without a\r\njury, all cases appealed from petty sessions, and it tries, with a (p. 173)\r\njury, and after indictment by a grand jury, all cases involving\r\noffenses not of a minor nature, save that the most serious offenses,\r\npunishable in most instances with death or life imprisonment, are\r\nreserved for trial in the assizes, i.e., by judges from Westminster\r\ntravelling on circuit. By means of the writs of _mandamus_ and\r\n_certiorari_ the actual proceedings of quarter sessions are controlled\r\nnot infrequently by the superior courts.[250]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 248: See p. 183.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 249: Chiefly by the Summary Jurisdiction\r\n                   Act of 1879.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 250: Medley, Manual of English\r\n                   Constitutional History, 392-400.

Beard, The Office of Justice of\r\n                   the Peace in England, in _Columbia University\r\n                   Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law_,\r\n                   XX., No. 1. (New York, 1904).]\r\n\r\n*181. Special Borough Arrangements.*--The smaller boroughs, having no\r\nseparate commissions of the peace, are for purposes of criminal\r\njustice merely portions of the counties in which they lie. In many of\r\nthe larger ones, however, there have been set up judicial arrangements\r\nin consequence of which the borough is withdrawn from the county\r\njurisdiction. Some have a commission of the peace but no quarter\r\nsessions. In them the justices can exercise, in addition to the usual\r\nfunctions of police magistrate, only a summary jurisdiction. Others\r\nhave a court of quarter sessions; though it is to be observed that\r\nwhere this tribunal exists its work is performed actually by the\r\nrecorder, a barrister appointed by the crown and paid by the borough.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE HIGHER COURTS\r\n\r\n*182. Supreme Court of Judicature: the High Court.*--The higher\r\ntribunals within the judicial system were once numerous and extremely\r\ncomplex. As reconstituted, however, by the great Judicature Act of\r\n1873, which, together with an Amending Act, took effect near the close\r\nof 1875, they have acquired a considerable degree of orderliness and\r\neven of simplicity. The measure of 1873 abolished the appellate\r\njurisdiction of the House of Lords, but the Amending Act three years\r\nlater rescinded this modification, and, as has been explained\r\nelsewhere, the House of Lords is still a court of very great\r\nimportance.[251] Aside from the Lords, however, the higher courts of\r\nthe realm--the Chancery, the three great Common Law courts, the\r\nAdmiralty, Probate, and Divorce courts, and the intermediate courts of\r\nappeal from these tribunals of first instance--were consolidated by\r\nthe legislation of 1873-1875 to form one grand organization, the\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature, which was thereupon cut into two\r\nbranches, the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal. The High\r\nCourt of Justice was assigned a general jurisdiction, civil and\r\ncriminal, as a court of first instance and also as a court of      (p. 174)\r\nappeal from inferior courts. Its jurisdiction represents essentially\r\nthe aggregate of jurisdictions of the tribunals which it superseded,\r\nand the various divisions into which it falls perpetuate in a measure\r\nthe names and functions of those tribunals. There were originally five\r\nof these divisions. To-day there are three: Chancery, King's Bench\r\n(with which the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions were united by\r\norder in council of December 16, 1880), and Probate, Divorce, and\r\nAdmiralty. Any High Court judge may sit in a tribunal belonging to any\r\none of these divisions. The Lord Chancellor presides over the Chancery\r\ndivision, the Chief Justice over the King's Bench. The number of\r\njudges is variable. The Chancery division contains at present six, the\r\nKing's Bench fifteen, and the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty division\r\nbut two. All save the Chancellor (who is a cabinet official, owing his\r\nposition to selection by the premier) are appointed by the crown upon\r\nadvice of the Chancellor, and all hold office during good behavior but\r\nmay be dismissed on addresses of the two houses of Parliament. The\r\njudges of the High Court sit both singly and in groups. The ordinary\r\ntrial of cases is conducted, under a variety of stipulated conditions,\r\nby a single judge, either at Westminster or on circuit. The judges who\r\ngo on circuit are taken as a rule from the King's Bench division, and\r\nwhen both civil and criminal cases are to be adjudicated they travel\r\nordinarily in pairs, one attending to the civil and the other to the\r\ncriminal business. Judges sit also, without juries, in divisional\r\ncourts, composed of two or more members, to hear appeals from inferior\r\ntribunals, motions for new trials, and applications for writs. The\r\nHigh Court never sits as a single body, nor does even the Chancery or\r\nthe King's Bench division.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 251: See p. 130.]\r\n\r\n*183. Supreme Court of Judicature: the Court of Appeals.*--The second\r\nbranch of the Supreme Court of Judicature is the Court of Appeal. This\r\ntribunal is composed of the Master of the Rolls and five Lords\r\nJustices of Appeal, all appointed by the crown upon the advice of the\r\nLord Chancellor. The presidents of the three divisions of the High\r\nCourt are also members, but they rarely participate in the work of the\r\ncourt; and since 1891 men who have occupied the office of Chancellor\r\nare _ex-officio_ members, although they sit only if they choose to\r\ncomply with a request of the Chancellor that they do so. The court\r\nperforms its functions regularly in two sections of three members\r\neach, although for some matters the presence of but two judges is\r\nrequired. Sittings are held only in London. The jurisdiction of the\r\ncourt is exclusively appellate, and its business consists very largely\r\nin the hearing of appeals in civil cases carried from the High Court.\r\nPrior to 1907 there was no general right of appeal in criminal cases.\r\nBy the Criminal Appeal Act of that year, however, there was        (p. 175)\r\nestablished a Court of Criminal Appeal to which any person convicted\r\nmay appeal on a question of law and, under stipulated conditions, on a\r\nquestion of fact also. This tribunal is composed of the Lord Chief\r\nJustice and eight judges of the King's Bench appointed by him with the\r\nassent of the Lord Chancellor. It, therefore, has no immediate\r\nconnection with the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n*184. The House of Lords and the Judicial Committee.*--Of superior\r\ntribunals there are two others of large importance, the House of Lords\r\nand the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The functions of the\r\nHouse of Lords as a court of last resort have been described\r\nelsewhere.[252] By the act of 1876 the appellate jurisdiction of the\r\nLords, withdrawn by the act of 1873, was restored and provision was\r\nmade for the strengthening of the legal element in the chamber by the\r\ncreation of life peers to be known as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.\r\nUnder existing law appeal lies to the Lords from any order or judgment\r\nof the Court of Appeal in England and of all Scottish and Irish courts\r\nfrom which appeals might, prior to 1876, be carried. The Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council was constituted in 1833 to assume\r\njurisdiction over a variety of cases formerly heard and decided\r\nnominally by the Council as a whole. The composition of the body has\r\nbeen changed a number of times. The members at present comprise the\r\nLords of Appeal in Ordinary, such members of the Privy Council as hold\r\nor have held high judicial office, two other Privy Councillors\r\ndesignated at pleasure by the crown, and, as a rule, one or two paid\r\nmembers who have held judicial office in India or the colonies. The\r\nmembership is thus large, but only four members need be present at the\r\nhearing of a case, and it may be pointed out that the working members\r\nof the Committee are predominantly the four \"law lords\" who comprise\r\nalso the working judicial element in the House of Lords. It is the\r\nbusiness of the Judicial Committee to consider and determine any\r\nmatter that may be referred to it by the crown, but, in the main, to\r\nhear final appeals from the ecclesiastical courts, from courts in the\r\nChannel Islands and the Isle of Man, from the courts of the colonies\r\nand dependencies, and from English courts established by treaty in\r\nforeign countries. Its decisions are tendered under the guise of\r\n\"advice to the crown\" and, unlike the decisions of the Lords, they\r\nmust bear the appearance, at least of unanimity.[253]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 252: See p. 130.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 253: For brief descriptions of the\r\n                   English judicial system see Lowell, Government of\r\n                   England, II., Chaps. 59-60; Anson, Law and Custom\r\n                   of the Constitution, II., Pt. 1., Chap. 10;\r\n                   Marriott, English Political Institutions, Chap. 14;\r\n                   and Macy, The English Constitution, Chap. 7.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ACT, 1835       (p. 176)\r\n\r\n*185. Periods in Local Governmental History.*--No description of a\r\ngovernmental system can be adequate which does not take into account\r\nthe agencies and modes by which the powers of government are brought\r\nclose to the people, as well as those by which the people in greater\r\nor lesser measure regulate locally their own public affairs. More\r\nespecially is this true in the instance of a government such as the\r\nEnglish in which local self-control is a fundamental rather than an\r\nincidental fact. The history of local institutions in England covers\r\nan enormous stretch of time, as well as a remarkable breadth of public\r\norganization and activity, and by no means its least important phases\r\nare those which have appeared in most recent times. Speaking broadly,\r\nit may be said to fall into four very unequal periods. The first,\r\nextending from the settlement of the Saxons to the Norman Conquest,\r\nwas marked by the establishment of the distinctive English units of\r\nadministration--shire, hundred, and township--and by the planting of\r\nthe principle of broadly popular local control. The second, extending\r\nfrom the Conquest to the fourteenth century, was characterized by a\r\ngeneral increase of centralization and a corresponding decrease of\r\nlocal autonomy. The third, extending from the fourteenth century to\r\nthe adoption of the Local Government Act of 1888, was pre-eminently a\r\nperiod of aristocratic control of local affairs, of government by the\r\nsame squirearchy which prior to 1832, if not 1867, was accustomed to\r\ndominate Parliament. The last period, that from 1888 to the present\r\ntime, has been notable in a special degree for the democratization and\r\nsystematization of local governing arrangements which has taken place\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n*186. County and Parish before 1832.*--The transformation by which the\r\ninstitutions of local government have been brought to their present\r\nstatus paralleled, and in a large measure sprang from, the\r\nrevolutionizing of Parliament during the course of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Two periods of change are especially noteworthy, the one\r\nfollowing closely the Reform Act of 1832 and culminating in the\r\nadoption of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, the other following\r\nsimilarly the Representation of the People Act of 1884 and         (p. 177)\r\nattaining fruition in the Local Government Act of 1888 and the\r\nDistrict and Parish Councils Act of 1894. At the opening of the\r\ncentury rural administration was carried on principally in the shire\r\nor county and the civil or \"poor law\" parish; urban administration in\r\nthe corporate towns, or municipal boroughs. The counties were\r\nfifty-two in number. Most of them were of Saxon origin, although some\r\nwere the product of absorptions or delimitations which took place in\r\nlater centuries. The last to be added were those of Wales. Altered\r\noften in respect to their precise functions, the counties retained\r\nfrom first to last a large measure of importance, and at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century they were still the principal areas of local\r\ngoverning activity. From Saxon times to the fourteenth century the\r\ndominating figure in county administration was the sheriff, but in the\r\nreign of Edward III. justices of the peace were created into whose\r\nhands during the ensuing five hundred years substantially all\r\nadministrative and judicial affairs of the county were drawn. These\r\ndignitaries were appointed by the crown, chiefly from the ranks of the\r\nsmaller landowners and rural clergy, and as a rule they comprised in\r\npractice a petty oligarchy whose conduct of public business was\r\ninspired by aristocratic, far more than by democratic, ideals.\r\n\r\nThe principal division of the county was the civil parish, usually but\r\nnot always identical with the ecclesiastical parish. The governing\r\nbodies of the parish were two--the vestry (either open to all\r\nrate-payers or composed of elected representatives), which\r\nadministered general affairs, and the overseers of the poor who under\r\nthe Elizabethan statute of 1601 were empowered to find employment for\r\nthe able-bodied poor, to provide other forms of relief as should be\r\nrequired, and to levy a local rate to meet the costs of their work.\r\nSince the passage of Gilbert's Act of 1782 the parishes had been\r\narranged in groups for poor-law purposes, and boards of guardians\r\nappointed by the justices of the peace had come to be the real\r\nauthorities in the administration of poor relief, as well as in most\r\nother matters. The abuses arising from poor-law administration were\r\nnot infrequently appalling.\r\n\r\n*187. The Borough before 1832.*--The corporate towns in England and\r\nWales numbered, in 1832, 246. They comprised population centers which,\r\non the basis of charters granted by the crown, had become distinct\r\nareas of local government. They did not, however, stand entirely apart\r\nfrom the county and parish organization. On the contrary, except in so\r\nfar as they were exempted specifically by the terms of their charters,\r\nthey were subject to the authority of the justices of the peace and of\r\nthe governing agencies of the parishes within whose jurisdiction they\r\nwere situated. Their style of government was determined largely    (p. 178)\r\nby the provisions of their charters, and since these instruments\r\nexhibited a marked degree of variety, uniformity of organization was\r\nentirely lacking. As a rule, however, the borough was a close\r\ncorporation, and the burgesses, or \"freemen,\" in whom were vested\r\npeculiar trading and fiscal rights and an absolute monopoly of the\r\npowers of government, comprised but a small fraction of the general\r\nbody of citizens. The governing authority of the borough was the town\r\ncouncil, whose members were either elected by the freemen or recruited\r\nby co-optation. Government was regularly oligarchical and\r\nirresponsible; sometimes it was inefficient and corrupt.\r\n\r\n*188. The New Poor Law (1834) and the Municipal Corporations Act\r\n(1835).*--The reforms accomplished since 1832 within the domain of\r\nparliamentary organization and procedure have been hardly more\r\nremarkable than those wrought during the same period within the field\r\nof local government. It must suffice to mention but the principal\r\nsteps by which the local governing system has been brought to its\r\npresent high degree of democracy and effectiveness. Among the subjects\r\nto which the first reformed parliament addressed its attention was the\r\ndireful condition into which had fallen the relief of the poor, and\r\nthe initial stage of local government regeneration was marked by the\r\nadoption of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, abolishing outdoor\r\nrelief for the able-bodied, providing for the regrouping of parishes\r\nin \"poor-law unions,\" and establishing a national Poor Law Commission.\r\nThe administration of relief within the unions was intrusted all but\r\nexclusively to newly created boards of guardians, composed in part of\r\nthe justices of the peace sitting _ex-officio_ and in part of members\r\nspecially elected by the rate-payers. The arrangements set up by the\r\nact proved very successful and they survive almost intact at the\r\npresent day. The second notable change was that effected by the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Act of 1835. The enfranchising of large numbers\r\nof the townspeople in 1832 led inevitably to demand for the\r\ndemocratization of the aristocratic borough governments, and within\r\nthree years the demand was met in a statute so sweeping as to justify\r\nthe assertion that with its enactment the modern history of the\r\nEnglish town begins.[254] Sixty-nine of the old corporate towns, by\r\nreason of their unimportance, were now deprived of the character of\r\nboroughs. The city of London was not touched, but elsewhere all\r\nmunicipal corporations were broadened so as to personify legally the\r\nentire population of the borough. The time-honored municipal oligarchy\r\nwas broken down by the giving of the franchise to all rate-payers, the\r\ntown councils were made wholly elective, trading monopolies and\r\nprivileges were swept away, and a variety of other reforms were    (p. 179)\r\nintroduced. With the adoption of this important measure, however, the\r\nwork of reform came for a time to a halt, and the widely assailed\r\nsystem of county government through nominated magistrates in quarter\r\nsessions survived until 1888.[255]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 254: Lowell, Government of England, II.,\r\n                   144.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 255: The history of the local\r\n                   institutions of England prior to 1835 is related in\r\n                   detail in two comprehensive works: H. A. Merewether\r\n                   and A. J. Stephens, History of the Boroughs and\r\n                   Municipal Corporations of the United Kingdom, 3\r\n                   vols.

Mid-Century Confusion of Areas and Jurisdictions.*--Throughout the\r\nearlier and middle portions of the Victorian period legislation\r\nrespecting local government was abundant, but it was special rather\r\nthan general. It pertained principally to the care of highways and\r\nburial grounds, the laying out and organization of districts for the\r\npromotion of sanitation, the establishment of \"improvement act\"\r\ndistricts, and, notably, the erection and administration of school\r\ndistricts under the Elementary Education Act of 1870. With each\r\nsuccessive measure the confusion of jurisdictions and agencies was\r\nincreased. The prevailing policy was to provide for each fresh need as\r\nit arose a special machinery designed to meet that particular need,\r\nand arrangements effected were seldom or never uniform throughout the\r\ncountry, nor did they bear any logical relation to arrangements\r\nalready existing for other purposes. By 1871 the country, as Lowell\r\nputs it, was divided into counties, unions, and parishes, and spotted\r\nover with boroughs and with highway, burial, sanitary, improvement\r\nact, school, and other districts, and of these areas none save the\r\nparishes and unions bore any necessary relation to any of the\r\nrest.[256] In the effort to adapt the framework of the administrative\r\nsystem to the fast changing conditions of a rapidly growing population\r\nParliament piled act upon act, the result being a sheer jungle of\r\ninterlacing jurisdictions alike baffling to the student and subversive\r\nof orderly and economical administration. It is computed that in 1883\r\nthere were in England and Wales no fewer than 27,069 independent local\r\nauthorities,[257] and that the rate-payer was taxed by eighteen\r\ndifferent kinds of rates.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 256: Government of England, II., 135.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 257: These included the 52 counties, the\r\n                   239 municipal boroughs, the 70 improvement act\r\n                   districts, the 1,006 urban sanitary districts, the\r\n                   577 rural sanitary districts, the 2,051 school\r\n                   board districts, the 424 highway districts, the 853\r\n                   burial board districts, the 649 poor-law unions,\r\n                   the 14,946 poor-law parishes, the 5,064 highway\r\n                   parishes not included in urban or highway\r\n                   districts, and the 1,300 ecclesiastical parishes.\r\n                   For the situation in 1888 see G. L. Gomme, Lectures\r\n                   on the Principles of Local Government (London,\r\n                   1897), 12-13.]\r\n\r\n*190. Local Government Act of 1888 and District and Parish         (p. 180)\r\nCouncils Act of 1894.*--Soon after the passage of the Elementary\r\nEducation Act of 1870 reform began to be attempted in the direction\r\nboth of concentration of local governing authority and the\r\nreadjustment and simplification of local governing areas. In 1871 the\r\nPoor Law Board (which succeeded the Poor Law Commission in 1847) was\r\nconverted into the Local Government Board, with the purpose of\r\nconcentrating in a single department the supervision of the laws\r\nrelating to public health, the relief of the poor, and local\r\ngovernment; and when, in 1872, the entire country was divided into\r\nurban and rural sanitary districts, the work was done deliberately in\r\nsuch a fashion as to involve the least possible addition to the\r\nexisting complexities of the administrative system.[258] The two\r\nmeasures, however, by which, in the main, order was brought out of\r\nconfusion were the Local Government Act of 1888 and the District and\r\nParish Councils Act of 1894. The first of these, referred to commonly\r\nas the County Councils Act, was the sequel of the Representation of\r\nthe People Act of 1884 and was definitely intended to invest the newly\r\nenfranchised rural population with a larger control of county affairs.\r\nThe act created sixty-two administrative counties (some coterminous\r\nwith pre-existing counties, others comprising subdivisions of them)\r\nand some three score \"county boroughs,\" comprising towns of more than\r\n50,000 inhabitants.[259] In each county and county borough there was\r\nset up a council, at least two-thirds of whose members were elective,\r\nand to this council was transferred the administrative functions of\r\nthe justices of the peace, leaving to those dignitaries of the old\r\nrégime little authority save of a judicial character. The\r\ndemocratization of rural government accomplished by the Conservative\r\nministry of Lord Salisbury in 1888 was supplemented by the provisions\r\nof the District and Parish Councils Act, carried by a Liberal ministry\r\nin 1894.[260] This measure provided (1) that every county should be\r\ndivided into districts, urban and rural, and every district into   (p. 181)\r\nparishes, and (2) that in every district and in every rural parish\r\nwith more than three hundred inhabitants there should be an elected\r\ncouncil, while in the smallest parishes there should be a primary\r\nassembly of all persons whose names appear on the local government and\r\nparliamentary register. To the parish councils and assemblies were\r\ntransferred all of the civil functions of the vestries, leaving to\r\nthose bodies the control of ecclesiastical matters only, while to the\r\ndistrict councils, whether rural or urban, were committed control of\r\nsanitary affairs and highways.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 258: The arrangements effected at this\r\n                   time were perpetuated in the great Public Health\r\n                   Act of 1875. Lowell, Government of England II.,\r\n                   137.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 259: The number of county boroughs had\r\n                   been increased by 1910 to seventy-four. See p.\r\n                   188.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 260: It should be observed that the\r\n                   original intent in 1888 was to deal with district\r\n                   as well as county organization. In its final form\r\n                   the bill carried in that year had to do only,\r\n                   however, with the counties.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the acts of 1888 and 1894 was two-fold. In the first\r\nplace, they put the administrative affairs of the rural portions of\r\nthe country in the hands almost exclusively of popularly elected\r\nbodies. In the second place, their adoption afforded opportunity for\r\nthe immediate or gradual abolition of all local governing authorities\r\nexcept the county, municipal, district, and parish councils, the\r\nboards of guardians, and the school boards, and thus they contributed\r\nvastly to that gradual simplification of the local governing system\r\nwhich is one of the most satisfactory developments of recent years.\r\nThe act of 1894 alone abolished some 8,000 authorities. Since 1894 the\r\nconsolidation of authorities and the elimination of areas have been\r\ncarried yet further, the most notable step being the abolition of the\r\nschool boards by the Education Act of 1902 and the transfer of the\r\nfunctions of these bodies to the councils of the counties, boroughs,\r\nand districts. Both the majority and minority reports of the recent\r\nPoor Law Commission, submitted in 1909, recommend the abolition of the\r\nparish union area; but no action has been taken as yet by Parliament\r\nupon this subject.[261]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 261: The history of local government\r\n                   changes since 1870 is well sketched in May and\r\n                   Holland, Constitutional History of England, III.,\r\n                   Chap. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe system of local government as it operates at the present time is\r\nby no means free from anomalies, but it exhibits, none the less, an\r\norderliness and a simplicity which were altogether lacking a\r\ngeneration ago. The variety of areas of administration has been\r\nlessened, the number of officials has been reduced and their relations\r\nhave been simplified, the guiding hand of the central authorities in\r\nlocal affairs has been strengthened. Stated briefly, the situation is\r\nas follows: the entire kingdom is divided into counties and county\r\nboroughs; the counties are subdivided into districts, rural and urban,\r\nand boroughs; these are subdivided further into parishes, which are\r\nregrouped in poor-law unions; while the city of London is organized\r\nafter a fashion peculiar to itself. In order to make clear the     (p. 182)\r\nessentials of the system it will be necessary to allude but briefly to\r\nthe connection which obtains between the local and central\r\nadministrative agencies, and to point out the principal features of\r\neach of the governmental units named.\r\n\r\n*191. The Five Central Departments.*--Throughout most periods of its\r\nhistory English local government has involved a smaller amount of\r\ninterference and of direction on the part of the central authorities\r\nthan have the local governments of the various continental nations.\r\nEven to-day the general government is not present in county or borough\r\nin any such sense as that in which the French government, in the\r\nperson of the prefect, is present in the department, or the Prussian,\r\nthrough the agency of the \"administration,\" is present in the\r\ndistrict. A noteworthy aspect of English administrative reform during\r\nthe past three-quarters of a century has been, nevertheless, a large\r\nincrease of centralized control, if not of technical centralization,\r\nin relation to poor-relief, education, finance, and the other varied\r\nfunctions of the local governing agencies. There are to-day five\r\nministerial departments which exercise in greater or lesser measure\r\nthis kind of control. One, the Home Office, has special surveillance\r\nof police and of factory inspection. A second, the Board of Education,\r\ndirects and supervises all educational agencies which are aided by\r\npublic funds. A third, the Board of Agriculture, supervises the\r\nenforcement of laws relating to markets and to diseases of animals. A\r\nfourth, the Board of Trade, investigates and approves enterprises\r\nrelating to the supply of water, gas, and electricity, and to other\r\nforms of \"municipal trading.\" Most important of all, the Local\r\nGovernment Board directs in all that pertains to the execution of the\r\npoor laws and the activities of the local health authorities, oversees\r\nthe financial operations of the local bodies, and fulfills a variety\r\nof other supervisory functions too extended to be enumerated. The\r\npowers of these departments in relation to local affairs are exercised\r\nin a number of ways, but chiefly through the promulgation of orders\r\nand regulations, the giving or withholding of assent to proposed\r\nmeasures of the local bodies, and the giving of expert advice and\r\nguidance. It need hardly be added that the powers and functions of the\r\nlocal authorities are subject at all times to control by parliamentary\r\nlegislation.[262]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 262: On the relations between the central\r\n                   and local agencies of government see Lowell,\r\n                   Government of England, II., Chap. 46; J. Redlich\r\n                   and F. W. Hirst, Local Government in England, 2\r\n                   vols.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO-DAY: RURAL                                (p. 183)\r\n\r\n*192. The Administrative County.*--Since the reform of 1888 there have\r\nbeen in England counties of two distinct kinds. There are, in the\r\nfirst place, the historic counties, fifty-two in number, which survive\r\nas areas for parliamentary elections and, in some instances, for the\r\norganization of the militia and the administration of justice. Their\r\nofficials--the lord lieutenant, the sheriff, and the justices of the\r\npeace--are appointed by the crown. Much more important, however, are\r\nthe administrative counties, sixty-two in number,[263] created and\r\nregulated by the local government legislation of 1888 and 1894. Six of\r\nthese administrative counties coincide geographically with ancient\r\ncounties, while most of the remaining ones represent no wide variation\r\nfrom the historic areas upon which they are based. Yorkshire and\r\nLincolnshire were divided into three of the new counties each, and\r\neight others were divided into two. The administrative counties do not\r\ninclude the seventy-four county boroughs which are located geographically\r\nwithin them, but they do include all non-county boroughs and urban\r\ndistricts, so that they are by no means altogether rural. They are\r\nextremely unequal in size and population, the smallest being Rutland\r\nwith 19,709 inhabitants and the largest Lancashire with 1,827,436.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 263: Including the county of London. See\r\n                   p. 190.]\r\n\r\n*193. The County Council.*--The governing authority in each\r\nadministrative county is the county council, a body composed of (1)\r\ncouncillors elected for a term of three years in single-member\r\nelectoral divisions under franchise qualifications identical with\r\nthose prevailing in the boroughs, save that plural voting is not\r\npermitted, and (2) aldermen chosen for six years by the popularly\r\nelected councillors. The number of aldermen is regularly one-third\r\nthat of the other councillors, and half of the quota retire\r\ntriennially. Between the two classes of members there is no\r\ndistinction of power or function. The council elects a chairman and\r\nvice-chairman who hold office one year but are commonly re-elected.\r\nOther officers are the clerk, the chief constable, the treasurer, the\r\nsurveyor, the public analyst, inspectors of various kinds, educational\r\nofficials, and coroners. The tenure of these is not affected by\r\nchanges in the composition of the council. Legally, the chairman is\r\nonly a presiding official, though in practice his influence may be,\r\nand not infrequently is, greater than that of any other member. In the\r\nelection of councillors party feeling seldom displays itself, and  (p. 184)\r\nelections are very commonly uncontested.[264] Members are drawn mainly\r\nfrom the landowners, large farmers, and professional men, though\r\nrepresentatives of the lower middle and laboring classes occasionally\r\nappear. The councils vary greatly in size, but the average membership\r\nis approximately seventy-five. The bringing together of so many men at\r\nfrequent intervals is not easily accomplished and the bodies do not\r\nassemble ordinarily more than the four times a year prescribed by law.\r\nThe mass of business devolving upon them is transacted largely through\r\nthe agency of committees. Of these, some, as the committees on\r\nfinance, education, and asylums, are required by law; others are\r\nestablished as occasion arises.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 264: At the elections of 1901 there were\r\n                   contests in but 433 of 3,349 divisions. P. Ashley,\r\n                   Local and Central Government; a Comparative Study\r\n                   of England, France, Prussia, and the United States\r\n                   (London, 1906), 25, note.]\r\n\r\nThe powers and duties of the council are many and varied. In the main,\r\nthough not wholly, they represent the former administrative functions\r\nof the justices of the peace. In the act of 1888 they are enumerated\r\nin sixteen distinct categories, of which the most important are the\r\nraising, expending, and borrowing of money; the care of county\r\nproperty, buildings, bridges, lunatic asylums, reformatory and\r\nindustrial schools; the appointment of inferior administrative\r\nofficials; the granting of certain licenses other than for the sale of\r\nliquor;[265] the care of main highways and the protection of streams\r\nfrom pollution; and the execution of various regulations relating to\r\nanimals, fish, birds, and insects. By the Education Act of 1902 the\r\ncouncil is given large authority within the domain of education. It\r\nmust see that adequate provision is made for elementary schools, and\r\nit may assist in the maintenance of agencies of education of higher\r\ngrades. The control of police within the county devolves upon a joint\r\ncommittee representing the council and the justices of the peace.\r\nFinally, the council may make by-laws for the county, supervise in a\r\nmeasure the minor rural authorities, and perform the work of these\r\nauthorities when they prove remiss.[266]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 265: Liquor licenses are granted by the\r\n                   justices of the peace.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 266: Lowell, Government of England, II.,\r\n                   274-275.]\r\n\r\n*194. The Rural District.*--Within the administrative county are four\r\nkinds of local government areas--rural districts, rural parishes,\r\nurban districts, and municipal boroughs. Of rural districts there are\r\nin England and Wales 672. They are coterminous, as a rule, with rural\r\npoor-law unions, or with the rural portions of unions which are both\r\nrural and urban; but they may not comprise parts of more than one\r\ncounty. The governing authority of the district is a council,      (p. 185)\r\ncomposed of persons (women being eligible) chosen in most instances\r\ntriennially by the rural parishes in accordance with population.\r\nUnless an order is made to the contrary, one-third retire each year.\r\nThe members at the same time represent on the board of guardians of\r\nthe union the parishes from which they have been elected, although the\r\ntwo bodies are legally distinct. The council must meet at least once a\r\nmonth. Its chairman, who during his year of office is _ex-officio_ a\r\njustice of the peace, may be chosen from among the councillors or from\r\noutside; and the same is true of members of committees. The principal\r\nsalaried and permanent officials are the clerk, the treasurer, a\r\nmedical officer, a surveyor, and sanitary inspectors. The functions of\r\nthe councils pertain, in the main, to the administration of sanitation\r\nand of highways. The bodies are responsible largely for the execution\r\nin the rural localities of the various public health acts, and they\r\nhave charge of all highways which are not classed as \"main roads.\" To\r\nmeet in part the costs of this administration they are empowered to\r\nlevy district rates.\r\n\r\n*195. The Parish.*--Of parishes there are two types, the rural and the\r\nurban, and their aggregate number in England and Wales is\r\napproximately 15,000. The urban parishes possess no general\r\nadministrative importance and further mention need not be made of them\r\nhere. Under the act of 1894 the rural parish, however, has been\r\nrevived in a measure from the inert condition into which it had\r\nfallen, and it to-day fills an appreciable if humble place in the\r\nrural administrative régime. The style of its organization is\r\ndependent to a degree upon its population. In each parish there is a\r\nmeeting in which all persons on the local government and parliamentary\r\nregisters (including women and lodgers) are privileged to participate.\r\nThis meeting elects its own chairman, and it likewise chooses a number\r\nof overseers whose duty it is to assess and collect certain local\r\nrates, to administer the poor-rate, and to make up the electoral and\r\njury lists. All parishes whose population numbers as much as three\r\nhundred have a council composed of from five to fifteen members (women\r\nbeing eligible), elected as a rule for a term of three years. The list\r\nof powers which the parish authorities may exercise is extended, if\r\nnot imposing. It includes the maintenance of foot-paths, the\r\nmanagement of civil parochial property, the provision of fire\r\nprotection, the inspection of local sanitation, and the appointment of\r\ntrustees of civil charities within the parish. The meagerness of the\r\npopulation of large numbers of the parishes, however, together with\r\nthe severe limitations imposed both by law and by practical conditions\r\nupon rate-levying powers, preclude the authorities very generally  (p. 186)\r\nfrom undertaking many or large projects. It is regarded commonly that\r\nthe parishes are too small to be made such areas of public activity as\r\nthe authors of the act of 1894 had in mind. Practically, the parish is\r\nlittle more than a unit for the election of representatives and the\r\ncollection of rates.[267]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 267: Lowell, Government of England, II.,\r\n                   281.]\r\n\r\nFor purposes of poor-law administration, as has been pointed out,\r\nthere have existed since 1834 poor-law unions, consisting of numbers\r\nof parishes grouped together, usually without much effort to obtain\r\nequality of size or population. These unions not infrequently comprise\r\nboth rural and urban parishes, and in cases of this kind the board of\r\nguardians is composed of the persons elected as district councillors\r\nin the rural parishes of the union, together with other persons who\r\nare elected immediately as guardians in the urban parishes and have no\r\nother function. The conditions under which poor relief is administered\r\nare prescribed rather minutely in general regulations laid down by the\r\nLocal Government Board at London, so that, save in the matter of\r\nlevying rates, the range of discretion left to the boards of guardians\r\nis closely restricted.[268]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 268: Ashley, Local and Central\r\n                   Government, 52-60.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO-DAY: URBAN\r\n\r\n*196. The Urban District.*--Of areas within which are administered the\r\nlocal affairs of the urban portions of the kingdom there are several\r\nof distinct importance, although in reality the institutions of urban\r\ngovernment are less complex than they appear on the surface to be. In\r\nthe main, the legal basis of urban organization is the Municipal\r\nCorporations Consolidation Act of 1882, which comprises a codification\r\nof the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 and a mass of subsequent and\r\namending legislation. This great statute is supplemented at a number\r\nof points by the Local Government Act of 1888, the District and Parish\r\nCouncils Act of 1894, the Education Act of 1902, and other regulative\r\nmeasures of the past thirty years. At the bottom of the scale among\r\nurban governmental units stands the urban district, which differs from\r\nan ordinary borough principally in that it has no charter and its\r\ncouncil possesses less authority than does that of the borough.[269]\r\nThe number of urban districts is in the neighborhood of eight hundred.\r\nUnder the terms of the act of 1894 the governing authority in each is\r\na council consisting of members elected for three years, women being\r\neligible. There are no aldermen, and no mayor is chosen. The       (p. 187)\r\ncouncil elects its own chairman and other officers, and it meets at\r\nleast once a month. Its functions, of which the most important is the\r\ncontrol of sanitation and of highways, are discharged largely through\r\nthe agency of committees. The district council possesses none of the\r\npolice and judicial privileges which the borough councils commonly\r\nenjoy. It is more closely controlled by the Local Government Board,\r\nand, in general, it lacks \"the status and ornamental trappings of a\r\nmunicipal authority.[270]\" Yet in practice its powers are hardly less\r\nextensive than are those of the council of a full-fledged borough. New\r\nurban districts may be created in thickly populated localities by\r\njoint action of the county council and the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 269: Speaking strictly, a borough is an\r\n                   urban district, and something more.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 270: Ashley, Local and Central\r\n                   Government, 45.]\r\n\r\n*197. Boroughs and \"Cities.\"*--The standard type of municipal unit is\r\nthe borough. Among boroughs there is a certain amount of variation,\r\nbut the differences which exist are those rather of historic\r\ndevelopment and of nomenclature than of governmental forms or\r\nfunctions. There are \"municipal\" boroughs, \"county\" boroughs, and\r\ncities. Any non-rural area upon which has been conferred a charter\r\nstipulating rights of local self-government is a borough. Areas of the\r\nsort which have been withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the\r\nadministrative counties in which they are situated are county\r\nboroughs; those not so withdrawn are municipal boroughs. The term\r\n\"city\" was once employed to designate exclusively places which were or\r\nhad been the seat of a bishop. Nowadays the title is borne not only by\r\nplaces of this nature but also by places, as Sheffield and Leeds, upon\r\nwhich it has been conferred by royal patent. Save, however, in the\r\ncase of the city of London, where alone in England ancient municipal\r\ninstitutions have been generally preserved, the term possesses no\r\npolitical significance.[271] The governments of the cities are\r\nidentical with those of the non-city boroughs. It is to be observed,\r\nfurther, that whereas formerly the borough as organized for municipal\r\npurposes coincided with the borough as constituted for purposes of\r\nrepresentation in Parliament, there is now no necessary connection\r\nbetween the two. An addition to a municipal borough does not alter the\r\nparliamentary constituency.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 271: See p. 190.]\r\n\r\n*198. Kinds of Boroughs.*--The Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 made\r\nprovision for 178 boroughs in England and Wales and stipulated\r\nconditions under which the number might be increased from time to time\r\nby royal charter. In not a few instances the charters of boroughs at\r\nthe time existing were of mediæval origin. Since 1875 new charters (p. 188)\r\nhave been conferred until the number of boroughs has been brought up\r\nto approximately 350. For the obtaining of a borough charter no fixed\r\nrequirement of population is laid down. Each application is considered\r\nupon its merits, and while the size and importance of an urban\r\ncommunity weigh heavily in the decision other factors not infrequently\r\nare influential, with the consequence that some boroughs are very\r\nsmall while some urban centers of size are not yet boroughs. Of the\r\npresent number of boroughs, seventy-four, or about one-fifth, are\r\ncounty boroughs. By the act of 1888 it was provided that every borough\r\nwhich had or should attain a population of 50,000 should be deemed,\r\nfor purposes of administration, a separate county, and should\r\ntherefore be exempt from the supervision exercised over the affairs of\r\nthe municipal boroughs by the authorities of the administrative\r\ncounties. Any borough with a population exceeding the figure named may\r\nbe created a county borough by simple order of the Local Government\r\nBoard. Unlike the ordinary municipal borough, the county borough is\r\nnot represented in the council of the county in which the borough\r\nlies; on the contrary, the council of the borough exercises\r\nsubstantially an equivalent of the powers exercised normally by the\r\ncounty council, and it is, to all intents and purposes, a council of\r\nthat variety. Much the larger portion of the English boroughs are,\r\nhowever, simple municipal boroughs, whose activities are subject to a\r\nsupervision more or less constant upon the part of the county\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n*199. The Borough Authorities.*--The difference between county and\r\nmunicipal boroughs is thus one of degree of local autonomy, not one of\r\nforms or agencies of government. The charters of all boroughs have\r\nbeen brought into substantial agreement and the organs of borough\r\ncontrol are everywhere the same. The governing authority is the\r\nborough council, which consists of councillors, aldermen, and a mayor,\r\nsitting as a single body. The councillors, varying in number from nine\r\nto upwards of one hundred, are elected by the voters of the borough,\r\neither at large or by wards, for three years, and one-third retire\r\nannually. The aldermen, equal in number to one-third of the\r\ncouncillors, are chosen by the entire council for six years, and are\r\nselected usually from among the councillors of most prolonged\r\nexperience. The mayor is elected annually by the councillors and\r\naldermen, frequently from their own number. In boroughs of lesser size\r\nre-elections are not uncommon. Service in all of the capacities\r\nmentioned is unpaid. The council determines its own rules of\r\nprocedure, and its work is accomplished in large measure through the\r\nagency of committees, some of which are required by statute, others of\r\nwhich are created as occasion demands; but, unlike the county      (p. 189)\r\ncouncil, the council of the borough cannot delegate any of its powers,\r\nsave those relating to education, to these committees. The mayor\r\npresides over the council meetings, serves commonly as an _ex-officio_\r\nmember of committees, and represents the municipality upon ceremonial\r\noccasions. The office is not one of power, although it is possible for\r\nan aggressive and tactful mayor to wield real influence. The permanent\r\nofficers of the council include a clerk, a treasurer, a medical\r\nofficial, a secretary for education, and a variable number of\r\ninspectors and heads of administrative departments.\r\n\r\n*200. The Borough Council.*--In the capacity of representative authority\r\nof the municipality the council controls corporation property, adopts\r\nand executes measures relative to police and education, levies rates,\r\nand not infrequently administers waterways, tramways, gas and electric\r\nplants, and a variety of other public utilities. The enormously\r\nincreased activity of the town and urban district councils in respect\r\nto \"municipal trading\" within the past two score years has aroused\r\nwidespread controversy. The purposes involved have been, in the main,\r\ntwo--to avert the evils of private monopoly and to obtain from\r\nremunerative services something to set against the heavy\r\nunremunerative expenditures rendered necessary by existing sanitary\r\nlegislation. And, although opposed by reason of the outlays which it\r\nrequires and the invasion of the domain of private enterprise which it\r\nconstitutes, the device of municipal ownership is being ever more\r\nwidely adopted, as in truth it is also in Germany and other European\r\ncountries.[272] Aside from its general functions, the borough councils\r\nis in particular a sanitary authority, and among its most important\r\ntasks is the execution of regulations concerning drainage, housing,\r\nmarkets, hospitals, and indeed the entire category of matters provided\r\nfor in the long series of Public Health acts. The expenditures of the\r\ncouncil as a municipal authority are met from a fund made up of fees,\r\nfines, and other proceeds of administration, together with the income\r\nfrom a borough rate, which is levied on the same basis as the poor\r\nrate; its expenditures as a sanitary authority are met from a fund\r\nraised by a general district rate. To assist in the administration of\r\neducation, sanitation, and police, grants are made regularly by\r\nParliament.[273]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 272: Ashley, Local and Central\r\n                   Government, 42.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 273: The best of existing works upon the\r\n                   general subject of English local government is J.\r\n                   Redlich, and F.

The Government of London.*--The unique governmental          (p. 190)\r\narrangements of London are the product in part of historical survival\r\nand in part of special and comparatively recent legislation.\r\nTechnically, the \"city\" of London is still what it has been through\r\ncenturies, i.e., an area with a government of its own comprising but\r\na single square mile on the left bank of the Thames. By a series of\r\nmeasures covering a period of somewhat more than fifty years, however,\r\nthe entire region occupied by the densely populated metropolis has\r\nbeen drawn into a closely co-ordinated scheme of local administration.\r\nLondon was untouched by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 and the\r\nchanges by which the governmental system of the present day was\r\nbrought into being began to be introduced only with the adoption of\r\nthe Metropolis Management Act of 1855. The government of the city was\r\nleft unchanged, but the surrounding parishes, hitherto governed\r\nindependently by their vestries, were at this time brought for certain\r\npurposes under the control of a central authority known as the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works. The Local Government Act of 1888 carried\r\nthe task of organization a stage further. The Board of Works was\r\nabolished, extra-city London was transformed into an administrative\r\ncounty of some 120 square miles, and upon the newly created London (p. 191)\r\nCounty Council (elected by the rate-payers) was conferred a varied and\r\nhighly important group of powers. Finally, in 1899 the London\r\nGovernment Act simplified the situation by sweeping away a mass of\r\nsurviving authorities and jurisdictions and by creating twenty-eight\r\nmetropolitan boroughs, each with mayor, aldermen, and councillors such\r\nas any provincial borough possesses, though with powers specially\r\ndefined and, on the side of finance, somewhat restricted. Within each\r\nborough are urban parishes, each with its own vestry.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the metropolitan area stands still the historic City,\r\nwith its lord mayor, its life aldermen, and its annually elected\r\ncouncillors, organized after a fashion which has hardly changed in\r\nfour and a half centuries. Within the administrative county the county\r\ncouncil acts as a central authority, the borough councils and the\r\nparish vestries serve as local authorities. While areas of common\r\nadministration still very much larger than the county comprise, among\r\nothers, the districts of the Metropolitan Water Board and of the\r\nMetropolitan Police. The jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police\r\nextends over all parishes within fifteen miles of Charing Cross, an\r\narea of almost 700 square miles.[274]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 274: For excellent descriptions of the\r\n                   government of London see Munro, Government of\r\n                   European Cities, 339-379 (bibliography, 395-402),\r\n                   and Lowell, Government of England, II., 202-232.\r\n                   Valuable works are G.

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO 1848\r\n\r\n*202. Napoleonic Transformations.*--Among the political achievements of\r\nthe past hundred years few exceed in importance, and none surpass in\r\ninterest, the creation of the present German Empire. The task of\r\nGerman unification may be regarded as having been brought formally to\r\ncompletion upon the occasion of the memorable ceremony of January 18,\r\n1871, when, in the presence of a brilliant concourse of princes and\r\ngenerals gathered in the Hall of Mirrors in the palace of the French\r\nkings at Versailles, William I., king of Prussia, was proclaimed\r\nGerman Emperor. Back of the dramatic episode at Versailles, however,\r\nlay a long course of nationalizing development, of which the\r\nproclamation of an Imperial sovereign was but the culminating event.\r\nThe beginnings of the making of the German Empire of to-day are to be\r\ntraced from a period at least as remote as that of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nGermany in 1814 was still disunited and comparatively backward, but it\r\nwas by no means the Germany of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. The transformations wrought to the east of the Rhine during\r\nthe period of the Napoleonic ascendancy were three-fold. In the first\r\nplace, after more than a thousand years of existence, the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire was, in 1806, brought to an end, and Germany, never theretofore\r\nsince the days of barbarism entirely devoid of political unity, was\r\nleft without even the semblance or name of nationality. In the second\r\nplace, there was within the period a far-reaching readjustment of the\r\npolitical structure of the German world, involving (1) the reducing of\r\nthe total number of German states--kingdoms, duchies, principalities,\r\necclesiastical dominions, and knights' holdings--from above three\r\nhundred to two score; (2) the augmenting of the importance of Austria\r\nby the acquisition of a separate imperial title,[275] and the      (p. 194)\r\nraising of Saxony, Bavaria, and Württemberg from duchies to kingdoms;\r\nand (3) the bringing into existence of certain new and more or less\r\nartificial political aggregates, namely, the kingdom of Westphalia,\r\nthe grand-duchy of Warsaw, and the Confederation of the Rhine, for the\r\npurpose of facilitating the Napoleonic dominance of north-central\r\nEurope. Finally, in several of the states, notably Prussia, the\r\noverturn occasioned by the Napoleonic conquests prompted systematic\r\nattempts at reform, with the consequence of a revolutionizing\r\nmodernization of social and economic conditions altogether comparable\r\nwith that which within the generation had been achieved in France.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 275: In anticipation of the prospective\r\n                   abolition of the dignity of Emperor of the Holy\r\n                   Roman Empire, the Emperor Francis II., in 1804,\r\n                   assumed the title of Emperor of Austria, under the\r\n                   name Francis I.]\r\n\r\nThe simple reduction of the German states in number, noteworthy though\r\nit was, did not mean necessarily the realization of a larger measure\r\nof national unity, for the rivalries of the states which survived\r\ntended but to be accentuated. But if the vertical cleavages by which\r\nthe country was divided were deepened, those of a horizontal\r\ncharacter, arising from social and economic privilege, were in this\r\nperiod largely done away. Serfdom was abolished; the knights as a\r\npolitical force disappeared; the free cities were reduced to four; and\r\nsuch distinctions of caste as survived rapidly declined in political\r\nimportance. By an appreciable levelling of society the way was\r\nprepared for co-ordinated national development, while by the\r\nextinction of a variety of republican and aristocratic sovereignties\r\nmonarchy as a form of government acquired new powers of unification\r\nand leadership.[276]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 276: On Germany during the Napoleonic\r\n                   period see Cambridge Modern History, IX., Chap. 11;\r\n                   J.

The Congress of Vienna and the Confederation of 1815.*--The\r\ncollapse of the dominion of Napoleon was followed in Germany by rather\r\nless of a return to earlier arrangements than might have been\r\nexpected. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have involved any such\r\nreturn at all. The Confederation of the Rhine was dissolved, and both\r\nthe grand-duchy of Warsaw and the kingdom of Westphalia ceased, as\r\nsuch, to be. But the Holy Roman Empire was not revived; the newly\r\nacquired dignities of the sovereigns of Saxony, Bavaria, and other\r\nstates were perpetuated; despite the clamors of the mediatized\r\nprinces, the scores of German states which during the decade had been\r\nswallowed up by their more powerful neighbors, or had been otherwise\r\nblotted out, were not re-established; and--most important of all--the\r\nsocial and economic changes by which the period had been given     (p. 195)\r\ndistinction were, in large part, not undone.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out, the close of the Napoleonic period found\r\nGermany entirely devoid of political unity, in both name and fact. By\r\nthe governments which were chiefly influential in the reconstruction\r\nof Europe in 1814-1815, it was deemed expedient that there be\r\nre-established some degree of German unity, though on the part of most\r\nof them, both German and non-German, there was no desire that there be\r\ncalled into existence a united German nation of substantial\r\nindependence and power. In the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna,\r\npromulgated under date of June 9, 1815, there was included the draft\r\nof a constitution, prepared by a committee of the Congress under the\r\npresidency of Count Metternich, in which was laid down the fundamental\r\nlaw of an entirely new German union. Within Germany proper there were\r\nrecognized to be, when the Congress had completed its work of\r\nreadjustment, thirty-eight states, of widely varying size, importance,\r\nand condition. Under authorization of the Congress, these states were\r\nnow organized, not into an empire with a common sovereign, but into a\r\n_Bund_, or Confederation, whose sole central organ was a _Bundestag_,\r\nor Diet, sitting at Frankfort-on-the-Main and composed of delegates\r\ncommissioned by the sovereigns of the affiliated states and serving\r\nunder their immediate and absolute direction. Save only in respect to\r\ncertain matters pertaining to foreign relations and war, each of the\r\nthirty-eight states retained its autonomy unimpaired.[277]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 277: In 1817 the number was brought up to\r\n                   39 by the adding of Hesse-Homburg, unintentionally\r\n                   omitted when the original list was made up. By\r\n                   successive changes the number was reduced to 33\r\n                   before the dissolution of the Confederation in\r\n                   1866.]\r\n\r\n*204. The Diet.*--The Diet was in no proper sense a parliamentary body,\r\nbut was rather a congress of sovereign states. Nominally, its powers\r\nwere large. They included both the regulation of the fundamental law\r\nand the performance of the functions of ordinary legislation. But, in\r\npractice, the authority of the body was meager and exercise of\r\ndiscretion was absolutely precluded. The members, as delegates of the\r\nprinces, spoke and voted only as they were instructed. Questions\r\nrelating to the fundamental laws and the organic institutions of the\r\nConfederation and \"other arrangements of common interest\" were\r\nrequired to be decided by the Diet as a whole (_in Plenum_), with\r\nvoting power distributed among the states, in rough proportion to\r\ntheir importance. Of the total of 69 votes, six of the principal\r\nstates possessed four each. The preparation of measures for discussion\r\n_in Plenum_ was intrusted to the \"ordinary assembly,\" a smaller    (p. 196)\r\ngathering in which Austria, Prussia, and nine other states had each\r\none vote, and six _curiæ_, comprising the remaining states in groups\r\nhad likewise each a single vote. The presidency of the two assemblies\r\nwas vested permanently in Austria, and the Austrian delegation\r\npossessed in each a casting vote. Proposals were carried in the\r\nsmaller body by simple majority, but _in Plenum_ only by a two-thirds\r\nvote. For the enactment of fundamental laws, the modification of\r\norganic institutions, the amendment of individual rights, and the\r\nregulation of religious affairs, it was declared by the Federal Act\r\nthat a majority vote should be insufficient, and, although it was not\r\nexpressly so stipulated, the intent was that in such cases unanimity\r\nshould be required. Early in the Diet's history, indeed, the president\r\nwas instructed solemnly to announce that the fundamental law of the\r\nConfederation, far from being subject to revision, was to be regarded\r\nas absolutely final.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation was, and was intended to be, only the loosest sort\r\nof a league of sovereign powers. The party of German unity,\r\nrepresented by Stein and the Liberals generally, began by assuming it\r\nto be a _Bundesstaat_, or true federal state; but at the opening of\r\nthe first session of the Diet (November 5, 1816) the Austrian\r\nauthorities formally pronounced it a _Staatenbund_, or federation of\r\nstates, and from this ruling, according strictly with both the facts\r\nof the situation and the intent of the founders, there was no possible\r\nescape. The powers and functions which were vested in the\r\nConfederation were exercised exclusively through and upon states, and\r\nwith the private individual it had no sort of direct relation, being,\r\nin these respects, essentially similar to the federal government of\r\nthe United States under the Articles of Confederation. The function of\r\nthe Diet, in effect, came to be little more than that of registering\r\nand promulgating the decrees of the authorities at Vienna.\r\n\r\n*205. Constitutional Progress, 1815-1848.*--Notwithstanding these facts,\r\nthe decade which terminates with the creation of the Confederation of\r\n1815 contributed enormously to the clearing of the way for the\r\nestablishment of modern German unity and of vigorous and efficient\r\nnational government. Among large numbers of the German people there\r\nhad been engendered a genuine desire, not only for constitutionalism\r\nin government, but for a substantial unification of the German-speaking\r\nworld; and the increased homogeneity and prosperity of the kingdom of\r\nPrussia pointed already to the eventual realization of these aspirations\r\nunder the leadership of that powerful state. The history of Germany\r\nduring the period from 1815 to 1848 is a story largely of the growth\r\nof these twin ideas of constitutionalism and nationality, and of   (p. 197)\r\nthe relentless combat which was waged between their exponents and the\r\nentrenched forces of autocracy and particularism. Gradually the\r\nresults of this conflict found expression through two developments,\r\n(1) the promulgation of liberalizing constitutions in a majority of\r\nthe states and (2) the building of the Zollverein, or customs union.\r\n\r\nThe original draft of the Federal Act of 1815 pledged every member of\r\nthe Confederation to establish a constitution within a year. In the\r\nfinal form of the instrument, however, the time limit was omitted and\r\nwhat had been a specific injunction became but a general promise. The\r\nsovereigns of the two preponderating states, Austria and Prussia,\r\ndelayed and eventually evaded the obligation altogether. But in a\r\nlarge number of the lesser states the promise that had been made was\r\nfulfilled with despatch. In the south the ground had been cleared by\r\nthe Napoleonic domination, and the influence of French political\r\nexperimentation was more generally felt, so that, very naturally, the\r\nprogress of constitutionalism was most rapid in that quarter. The new\r\nera of constitution-making was inaugurated by the promulgation of the\r\nfundamental law of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, January 8, 1816. In rapid\r\nsuccession followed similar grants in Schaumburg-Lippe, January 15, 1816;\r\nWaldeck, April 19, 1816; the grand-duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, May 5,\r\n1816; Saxe-Hildburghausen, March 19, 1818; Bavaria, May 26, 1818;\r\nBaden, August 22, 1818; Lichtenstein, November 9, 1818; Württemberg,\r\nSeptember 25, 1819; Hanover, December 7, 1819; Brunswick, April 25,\r\n1820, and the grand-duchy of Hesse, December 17, 1820. Instruments\r\npromulgated later during the period under review include those of\r\nSaxe-Meiningen, in 1829; Hesse-Cassel, Saxe-Altenburg, and Saxony, in\r\n1831; Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, in 1833; Lippe, in 1836; and Lübeck,\r\nin 1846. In a number of the states mentioned, including Bavaria,\r\nBaden, Württemberg, and Saxony, the constitutions at this time granted\r\nare still in operation. Many of them were, and some of them remain,\r\nhighly illiberal. But, in the aggregate, the ground gained in behalf\r\nof constitutional and enlightened government through their\r\npromulgation was enormous.\r\n\r\nThe spread of constitutionalism was paralleled by the gradual\r\ncreation, after 1818, of the Zollverein. This was a customs union,\r\ntaking its origin in the establishment of free trade throughout the\r\nkingdom of Prussia, and extended from state to state until by 1842 the\r\nwhole of Germany had been included save the Hanseatic towns,\r\nMecklenburg, Hanover, and Austria. The union was maintained for\r\npurposes that were primarily commercial, but by accustoming the people\r\nto concerted effort and by emphasizing constantly their common\r\ninterests it must be regarded as having contributed in a very      (p. 198)\r\nimportant way to the growth of national consciousness and solidarity.\r\nUnder its agency the lesser states were schooled deliberately in\r\nindependence of Austria and in reliance upon Prussian leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CREATION OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n*206. The Revolution of 1848.*--From 1815 onwards the Liberals\r\nadvocated, in season and out, the conversion of the Confederation into\r\na more substantial union under a constitutional style of government.\r\nAside from the promulgation of a number of new state constitutions,\r\nthe effects of the revolutionary movements of 1830 were, in Germany,\r\nof little consequence. But during the period 1830-1848 conditions so\r\ndeveloped that only the stimulus of a near-by liberal demonstration\r\nwas required to precipitate to the east of the Rhine a popular\r\nuprising of revolutionary proportions. In the constitutional history\r\nof the German countries of central Europe few periods are to be\r\nassigned larger importance than the years 1848-1849. Taking advantage\r\nof the interest created by the contemporary revolution in France, the\r\nLiberal leaders began by convening at Heidelberg, March 31, 1848, a\r\n_Vorparlament_, or preliminary meeting, by which arrangements were\r\neffected for the election, by manhood suffrage, of a national assembly\r\nof some six hundred members whose business it should be to draw up a\r\nconstitution for a united German nation. This assembly, reluctantly\r\nauthorized by the Diet, convened May 18 in the free city of Frankfort.\r\nThe task to be accomplished was formidable and much valuable time was\r\nconsumed in learned but irrelevant disputation. In the end it was\r\ndecided that not the whole of Austria, but only the German portions,\r\nshould be admitted to the new union; that there should be established\r\na full-fledged parliamentary system, with a responsible ministry; and\r\nthat the parliament should consist of two chambers, the lower to be\r\nchosen by direct manhood suffrage, the upper to be made up half of\r\nmembers appointed by the princes and half of members elected for six\r\nyears by the legislative bodies of the several states. As an executive\r\nsome desired a directory of three princes and some wanted a single\r\npresident; but the majority voted at length to establish the dignity\r\nof German Emperor and to offer it to Frederick William IV., king of\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\n*207. The Reaction.*--The refusal of the Prussian monarch to accept the\r\nproffered title, save upon the impossible condition that all of his\r\nbrother princes in Germany should give their assent to his so doing,\r\nblasted the hopes of the patriots. In May, 1849, the Frankfort\r\nassembly broke up. Not long thereafter Prussia, Saxony, and        (p. 199)\r\nHanover agreed upon a constitution substantially like that which the\r\nFrankfort meeting had proposed. Other states accepted it, and March\r\n20, 1850, a parliament was convened under it at Erfurt. By reason of\r\nthe recovery of Austria, however, and the subsidence of the\r\nrevolutionary movement generally throughout Germany the experiment\r\npromptly collapsed. The conception of a German empire had been\r\nformulated with some definiteness, but for its realization the day had\r\nnot yet arrived. The old Confederation, under Austrian domination,\r\nkept the field. After an upheaval which involved the enforced\r\npromulgation of a constitution, the accession of a new emperor (the\r\npresent Francis Joseph), and the threatened loss of Hungary, Bohemia,\r\nand the Italian dependencies, the Austrian monarchy recovered its\r\nbalance and inaugurated a fresh era of reaction, during the course of\r\nwhich there was revoked not only the constitution conceded at Vienna\r\nbut also that of almost every one of the German states.[278]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 278: See pp. 454-456.]\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the outcome was more fortunate. In January, 1850, Frederick\r\nWilliam IV, granted a constitution which established a national\r\nlegislative assembly and admitted a portion of the Prussian people to\r\nan active participation in the government. Although the instrument\r\nproved a disappointment to the Liberals, it has survived, with some\r\nmodifications, to the present day as the fundamental law of the\r\nPrussian kingdom; and the fact that Prussia had become fixedly a\r\nconstitutional state, together with the hopeless deadlock which arose\r\nbetween Prussia and Austria in the attempted readjustments of\r\n1848-1849, emphasized the conclusion that the future of Germany lay\r\nwith Prussia rather than with Austria, and that, indeed, there could\r\nbe no adequate unification of the German people until one of the two\r\ngreat rival states should have been definitely ejected.[279]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 279: On the revolution of 1848 in Germany\r\n                   see Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chaps. 3, 6, 7;\r\n                   H. von Sybel, The Founding of the German Empire\r\n                   trans. by M.

The War of 1866.*--With the elevation of Count von Bismarck,\r\nSeptember 23, 1862, to the presidency of the Prussian ministry,\r\naffairs began to move rapidly toward the inevitable conclusion. A\r\nmonth prior to Bismarck's appointment there had been held at Frankfort\r\na conference--the so-called _Fürstentag_--whose object was the\r\nproposal of a plan for the reconstitution of the Confederation. The\r\nscheme suggested contemplated the establishment of a directory, an\r\nassembly composed of delegates from the various diets, and a federal\r\ncourt of appeal. The conference was held at the instigation of     (p. 200)\r\nAustria, and it was intended primarily to promote an alignment of the\r\nliberal forces against Prussia. The last-mentioned state refused,\r\nnaturally, to have part in the proceedings, and the enterprise came to\r\nnaught. A brief interlude in the fast developing contest was afforded\r\nby the Austro-Prussian alliance against Denmark in 1864; but the net\r\nresult of this episode was only to supply the occasion for war which\r\nBismarck desired. In 1866 Prussia came forward with a project for the\r\nreorganization of the Confederation (in reality, a counter-bid for\r\npopular support), the more noteworthy features of which were the total\r\nexclusion of Austria from the league and the establishment of a\r\nparliament elected by manhood suffrage. As was inevitable, the Diet\r\nrejected the scheme; whereupon, with the object of forcing Austria\r\ninto helpless isolation, Bismarck and his royal master, William I., in\r\nJune, 1866, proclaimed the Confederation to be dissolved and plunged\r\nthe whole of Germany in civil war.\r\n\r\n*209. The North German Bund, 1867.*--The conflict was short and sharp.\r\nIts outcome was the crushing defeat of Austria, and in the treaty of\r\nPrague (August 23, 1866) the proud Hapsburg monarchy was compelled to\r\nassent to a reconstitution of the German federation in which Austria\r\nshould have no part. A number of lesser states which had supported\r\nAustria--Hanover, Nassau, Hesse-Cassel, and Frankfort--were forthwith\r\nincorporated by Prussia, by decree of September 20, 1866,[280] and\r\namong the group of surviving powers the preponderance of Prussia was\r\nmore than ever indisputable. Realizing, however, that the states of\r\nthe south--Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Hesse-Darmstadt--were not\r\nas yet ready to be incorporated under a centralized administration,\r\nPrussia contented herself for the moment with setting up a North\r\nGerman _Bund_, comprising the states to the north of the river Main,\r\ntwenty-two in all. February 24, 1867, there was brought together in\r\nBerlin a constitutional diet, representing all of the affiliated\r\nstates and elected by manhood suffrage and secret ballot. A\r\nconstitution, drafted previously by a committee of plenipotentiaries,\r\nwas debated from March 9 to April 16 and was adopted by a vote of 230\r\nto 53. After having been ratified by the legislative bodies of the\r\nvarious states, the instrument was put in operation, July 1. The\r\nprincipal organs of government for which it made provision were three\r\nin number: (1) the _Præsidium_, or President, of the Confederation,\r\nthe dignity being hereditary and vested in the king of Prussia; (2)\r\nthe _Bundesrath_, or Federal Council, representing the various\r\ngovernments; and (3) the _Bundestag_, or Diet, composed of deputies\r\nelected directly by manhood suffrage. For all practical purposes   (p. 201)\r\nthe German Empire, under the hegemony of Prussia, was a reality.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 280: The disputed districts of\r\n                   Schleswig-Holstein were annexed at the same time.]\r\n\r\n*210. Establishment of the Empire, 1871.*--For the time being the states\r\nto the south of the Main were left to their own devices, though the\r\nconstitution of the _Bund_ was shaped purposely to permit, and even to\r\nencourage, the accession of new members. Very soon these southern\r\nstates entered the new customs union of 1867, maintained by the\r\nnorthern states, and ere long they were concluding with Prussia\r\ntreaties of both offensive and defensive alliance. The patriotic\r\nfervor engendered by the war with France in 1870-1871 sufficed to\r\ncomplete the work. Contrary to the expectation of Napoleon III., the\r\nstates of the south contributed troops and otherwise co-operated\r\nvigorously with the Prussians throughout the contest, and before its\r\nclose they let it be known that they were ready to become full-fledged\r\nmembers of the Confederation. On the basis of treaty arrangements,\r\nconcluded in November, 1870, it was agreed that the North German\r\nConfederation should be replaced by a German Empire, and that for the\r\ntitle of President, borne by the Prussian sovereign, should be\r\nsubstituted that of _Deutscher Kaiser_, German Emperor. January 18,\r\n1871, at Versailles, William, king of Prussia and President of the\r\nConfederation, was formally proclaimed German Emperor. The siege of\r\nParis was at the time still in progress, and the treaty of Frankfort,\r\nby which peace with France was concluded, was not signed until the\r\nfollowing May.[281]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 281: For brief accounts of the founding\r\n                   of the Empire see B.

THE CONSTITUTION: NATURE OF THE EMPIRE                        (p. 202)\r\n\r\n*211. The Constitution Framed.*--As ordained in the treaties of\r\nNovember, 1870, ratified subsequently by the _Bundesrath_ and the\r\n_Bundestag_ of the North German Confederation, and by the legislative\r\nassemblies of the four incoming states, the German Empire came legally\r\ninto existence January 1, 1871. It consisted fundamentally of the\r\nConfederation, which in the process of expansion did not lose its\r\ncorporate identity, together with the four states, whose treaties\r\nbound them severally to it. The _Bund_ was conceived of technically,\r\nnot as replaced by, but rather as perpetuated in, the new Empire. The\r\naccession of the four southern states, however, involved of necessity\r\na considerable modification of the original character of the\r\naffiliation; and the innovations that were introduced called for a\r\ngeneral reconstitution of the fundamental law upon which the enlarged\r\nstructure was to be grounded.\r\n\r\nThe elements at hand for the construction of the constitution of the\r\nEmpire were four: (1) the constitution of the North German\r\nConfederation, in operation since 1867; (2) the treaties of November\r\n15, 1870, between the Confederation, on the one hand, and the\r\ngrand-duchies of Baden and Hesse on the other; (3) the treaty of\r\nNovember 23, 1870, by which was arranged the adhesion of the kingdom of\r\nBavaria; and (4) the treaty of November 25, 1870, between the _Bund_,\r\nBaden, and Hesse, on the one side, and the kingdom of Württemberg on\r\nthe other. Each of these treaties stipulated the precise conditions\r\nunder which the new affiliation should be maintained, these\r\nstipulations comprising, in effect, so many projected amendments of\r\nthe original constitution of the _Bund_.[282] At the initiative of the\r\nEmperor there was prepared, early in 1871, a revised draft of this\r\nconstitution, and in it were incorporated such modifications as were\r\nrendered necessary by the adhesion of the southern states and the\r\ncreation of the Imperial title. March 31 the Reichstag was convened in\r\nBerlin and before it was laid forthwith the constitutional _projet_,\r\nto which the Bundesrath had already given its assent. April 14 the\r\ninstrument was approved by the popular chamber, and two days later it\r\nwas promulgated as the supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 282: The first three of these treaties\r\n                   were concluded at Versailles; the fourth was signed\r\n                   at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n*212. Contents of the Instrument.*--As it came from the hands of its\r\nframers, the new constitution comprised a judicious amalgamation of\r\nthe various fundamental documents that have been mentioned, i.e., the\r\nconstitution of the Confederation and the treaties. Within the     (p. 203)\r\nscope of its seventy-eight articles most subjects which are dealt with\r\nordinarily in such instruments find ample place: the nature and extent\r\nof the legislative power; the composition, organization, and procedure\r\nof the legislative chambers; the privileges and powers of the\r\nexecutive; the adjustment of disputes and the punishment of offenses\r\nagainst the national authority; the process of constitutional\r\namendment. It is a peculiarity of the German constitution, however,\r\nthat it contains elaborate provisions relating to a variety of things\r\nconcerning which constitutions, as a rule, are silent. There is an\r\nextended section upon customs and commerce; another upon railways;\r\nanother upon posts and telegraphs; another upon navigation; another\r\nupon finance; and an especially detailed one relating to the military\r\norganization of the realm. In part, the elaboration of these\r\nessentially legislative subjects within the constitution was\r\ndetermined by the peculiarly federal character of the Empire, by which\r\nwas entailed the necessity of a minute enumeration of powers. In a\r\ngreater measure, however, it arose from the underlying purpose of\r\nBismarck and of William I. to smooth the way for the conversion of\r\nGermany into the premier militant power of Europe. Beyond a guarantee\r\nof a common citizenship for all Germany and of equal protection for\r\nall citizens as against foreign powers, the constitution contains\r\nlittle that relates to the status or privileges of the individual.\r\nThere is in it no bill of rights, and it makes no mention of abstract\r\nprinciples. Among instruments of its kind, none is of a more\r\nthoroughly practical character.[283]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 283: The text of the constitution, in\r\n                   German, is printed in A.

Federal Character of the Empire.*--The political system of Germany\r\nto-day is the product of centuries of particularistic statecraft,\r\ncapped, in 1871, by a partial centralization of sovereign organs and\r\npowers. The Empire is composed of twenty-five states: the four kingdoms\r\nof Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemberg; the six grand-duchies of\r\nBaden, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Saxe-Weimar, Mecklenburg-Strelitz,\r\nand Oldenburg; the five duchies of Brunswick, Saxe-Meiningen,\r\nSaxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Anhalt; the seven           (p. 204)\r\nprincipalities of Schwarzburg-Sonderhausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt,\r\nWaldeck, Reuss Älterer Linie, Reuss Jüngerer Linie, Lippe, and\r\nSchaumburg-Lippe; and the three free cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and\r\nLübeck. These states vary in size from Prussia, with 134,616 square\r\nmiles, to Bremen, with 99; and in population, from Prussia, with\r\n40,163,333, to Schaumburg-Lippe, with 46,650. There is, in addition,\r\nthe _Reichsland_, or Imperial domain, of Alsace-Lorraine, whose status\r\nuntil 1911 was that of a purely dependent territory, but which by act\r\nof the year mentioned was elevated to a condition of quasi-statehood.[284]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 284: See p. 285.]\r\n\r\nPrior to the formation in 1867, of the North German Confederation,\r\neach of the twenty-five states was sovereign and essentially\r\nindependent. Each had its own governmental establishment, and in many\r\ninstances the existing political system was of considerable antiquity.\r\nWith the organization of the _Bund_, those states which were\r\nidentified with the federation yielded their independence, and\r\npresumably their sovereignty; and with the establishment of the\r\nEmpire, all gave up whatever claim they as yet maintained to absolute\r\nautonomy. Both the _Bund_ and the Empire were creations, strictly\r\nspeaking, of the states, not of the people; and, to this day, as one\r\nwriter has put it, the Empire is \"not a juristic person composed of\r\nfifty-six million members, but of twenty-five members.\"[285] At the\r\nsame time, it is not what the old Confederation of 1815 was, i.e., a\r\nleague of princes. It is a state established by, and composed of,\r\nstates.[286]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 285: P.

THE EMPIRE AND THE STATES                                      (p. 205)\r\n\r\n*214. Sovereignty and the Division of Powers.*--The Germans are not\r\nthemselves altogether agreed concerning the nature and precise\r\nlocation of sovereignty within the Empire, but it is reasonably clear\r\nthat sovereignty, in the ultimate meaning of that much misused term,\r\nis vested in the government of the Empire, and not in that of any\r\nstate. The embodiment of that sovereignty, as will appear\r\nsubsequently, is not the national parliament, nor yet the Emperor, but\r\nthe Bundesrath, which represents the \"totality\" of the affiliated\r\ngovernments.[287] As in the United States, Switzerland, and federal\r\nnations generally, there is a division of powers of government between\r\nthe central governmental establishment and the states. The powers of\r\nthe Imperial government, it is important to observe, are specifically\r\nenumerated; those of the states are residual. It is within the\r\ncompetence of the Imperial government to bring about an enlargement of\r\nthe powers that have been confided to it; but until it does so in any\r\nparticular direction the power of the state governments in that\r\ndirection is unlimited. On the one hand, there is a considerable field\r\nof legislative activity--in respect to citizenship, tariffs, weights,\r\nmeasures, coinage, patents, military and naval establishment of the\r\nEmpire, etc.--in which the Empire, by virtue of constitutional\r\nstipulation, possesses exclusive power to act.[288] On the other,\r\nthere is a no less extensive domain reserved entirely to the\r\nstates--the determination of their own forms of government, of laws of\r\nsuccession, of relations of church and state, of questions pertaining\r\nto their internal administration; the framing of their own budgets,\r\npolice regulations, highway laws and laws relating to land tenure; the\r\ncontrol of public instruction. Between lies a broad and shifting area,\r\nwhich each may enter, but within which the Imperial authority, in so\r\nfar as is warranted by the constitution, must be accorded precedence\r\nover the authority of a state. \"The matters over which the states\r\npreserve control,\" says a great German jurist, \"cannot be separated\r\ncompletely from those to which extends the competence of the Empire.\r\nThe various powers of government are intimately related the one to\r\nanother. They run together and at the same time impose mutual checks\r\nin so many ways, and are so interlaced, that one cannot hope to set\r\nthem off by a line of demarcation, or to set up among them a Chinese\r\nwall of division. In every sphere of their activity the states     (p. 206)\r\nencounter a superior power to which they are obliged to submit. They\r\nare free to move only in the circle which Imperial law-making leaves\r\nopen to them. That circle does exist. It is delimited, but not wholly\r\noccupied, by the Empire.... In a certain sense it may be said that it\r\nis only by sufferance of the Empire that the states maintain their\r\npolitical rights at all, and that, at best, their tenure is\r\nprecarious.\"[289]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 287: Howard, German Empire, 21.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 288: Matters placed under the supervision\r\n                   of the Empire and made subject to Imperial\r\n                   legislation are enumerated in the sixteen sections\r\n                   of Article 4 of the constitution. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 327-328.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 289: Laband, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   deutschen Reiches (2d ed.), I., 102-103.]\r\n\r\nIn passing, it may be observed that there is, in fact, a distinct\r\ntendency toward the reduction of the spheres of authority which\r\nformerly were left to the states. One of the means by which this has\r\nbeen brought about is the establishment of uniform codes of law\r\nthroughout the Empire, containing regulations respecting a multitude\r\nof things which otherwise would have been regulated by the states\r\nalone. Most important among these is the great Civil Code, which went\r\ninto effect January 1, 1900. Another means to the same end is the\r\nincrease in recent years of Imperial legislation relating to\r\nworkingmen's insurance, factory regulations, industrial conditions,\r\nand other matters of a social and economic nature. Not infrequently in\r\nrecent times have the states, or some of them, raised protest against\r\nthis centralizing tendency, and especially against the \"Prussianization\"\r\nof the Empire which it seems clearly to involve. In many states,\r\nespecially those to the south of the Main, the separatist tradition is\r\nstill very strong. In Bavaria, more than anywhere else, is this true,\r\nand in 1903 the new Bavarian premier, Baron Podevils, was able to\r\narouse genuine enthusiasm for his government by a solemn declaration\r\nbefore the diet that he and his colleagues would combat with all their\r\nmight \"any attempt to shape the future of the Empire on lines other\r\nthan the federative basis laid down in the Imperial constitution.\"\r\n\r\n*215. The Interlacing of Governmental Agencies.*--The functions of a\r\nlegislative character which are delegated to the Imperial government\r\nare numerous and comprehensive, and in practice they tend all the\r\nwhile to be increased. Those of an executive and judicial character\r\nare very much more restricted. In respect to foreign relations, the\r\nnavy, and the postal and telegraph service, administration is\r\nabsolutely centralized in the organs of the Empire; in respect to\r\neverything else, administrative functions are performed entirely, or\r\nalmost entirely, through the agency of the states. In the United\r\nStates the federal government is essentially complete within itself.\r\nIt has its own law-makers, administrators, and judges, who carry on\r\nthe national government largely independently of the governing agencies\r\nof the various states. In Germany, where the state occupies in     (p. 207)\r\nsome respects a loftier position in the federation than does its\r\ncounterpart in America, the central government, in respect to all save\r\nthe fields that have been mentioned, relies for the execution of its\r\nmeasures upon the officials of the states. The Empire establishes\r\ntaxes and customs duties, but the imposts are collected by state\r\nauthorities. Similarly, justice is rendered, not in the name of the\r\nEmpire, but in the name of the state, and by judges in the employ of\r\nthe state. In respect to machinery, the Imperial government is,\r\ntherefore, but a part of a government. Alone, it could not be made to\r\noperate. It lacks a judiciary; likewise the larger portion of the\r\nadministrative agencies without which mere powers of legislative\r\nenactment are futile. To put the matter succinctly, the working\r\ngovernment of the Empire comprises far more than the organs and\r\nfunctions that are purely Imperial; it comprises the federal organs\r\nand functions possessed by the individual states as well.[290]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 290: Laband, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   deutschen Reiches, § 7-10; Lebon, Études sur\r\n                   l'Allemagne politique, 93-104.]\r\n\r\n*216. The States: the Prussian Hegemony.*--Legally, the union of the\r\nGerman states is indestructible. The Imperial government is vested\r\nwith no power to expel a state, to unite it with another state, to\r\ndivide it, or in any way to alter its status in the federation. On the\r\nother hand, no state possesses a right to secede, or to modify its\r\npowers or obligations within the Empire. If a state violates its\r\nobligations or refuses to be bound by the authority of the Empire, the\r\nfederal army, on decision of the Bundesrath, may be mobilized by the\r\nEmperor against it.[291]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 291: Art. 19. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 332.]\r\n\r\nAmong the states, however, there is a glaring lack of equality of\r\nstatus and privilege. When the Empire was formed the component states\r\ndiffered widely in area, population, and traditional rights, and there\r\nwas no attempt to reduce them to a footing that should be absolutely\r\nuniform. Prussia, besides comprising the moving spirit in the new\r\naffiliation, contained a population considerably in excess of that of\r\nthe other twenty-four states combined. The consequence was that\r\nPrussia became inevitably the preponderating power in the Empire. The\r\nking of Prussia is _ex-officio_ German Emperor; the Prussian votes in\r\nthe Bundesrath can defeat any proposed amendment of the constitution,\r\nand likewise any measure looking toward a change in the army, the\r\nnavy, or the taxes; and Prussia controls the chairmanship of all\r\nstanding committees in the Bundesrath.[292]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 292: A. Lebon, La constitution allemande\r\n                   et l'hégémonie prussienne, in _Annales de l'École\r\n                   Libre des Sciences Politiques_, Jan., 1887.]\r\n\r\n*217. Military Arrangements.*--Other privileges Prussia possesses  (p. 208)\r\nby virtue, not of the constitution, but of agreements with her sister\r\nstates. The most important of these relates to the army. By the\r\nconstitution it was provided at the outset that the armed forces of\r\nthe Empire should be organized into a single establishment, to be\r\ngoverned by Imperial law and to be under the supreme command of the\r\nEmperor.[293] In respect to the appointment of minor officers, and\r\nsome other matters, powers of jurisdiction were left, however, to the\r\nindividual states. These powers were in themselves worth little, and\r\nin the course of time all of the states save Bavaria, Saxony, and\r\nWürttemberg were brought to the point of yielding to Prussia the\r\nslender military authority that remained to them.[294] In this manner\r\nPrussia acquired the right to recruit, drill, and officer the\r\ncontingents of twenty-one states--a right which appreciably increased\r\nher already preponderant authority in all matters of a military\r\ncharacter. Technically, there is no _German_ army, just as there is no\r\n_German_ minister of war. Each state maintains its own contingent, and\r\nthe contingent maintained by the state is stationed normally within\r\nthat state. By virtue of the treaties, however, all contingents save\r\nthose of Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemburg are administered precisely\r\nas if they comprised integral parts of the Prussian establishment.[295]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 293: Arts. 61, 63, 64. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 345-347.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 294: The first of the Prussian military\r\n                   treaties, that concluded with Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,\r\n                   dates from 1861; the last, that with Brunswick,\r\n                   from 1885.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 295: Howard, The German Empire, Chap. 12;\r\n                   Laband, Das Staatsrecht des deutschen Reiches, §§\r\n                   95-113; C. Morhain, De l'empire allemand (Paris,\r\n                   1886), Chap. 15.]\r\n\r\n*218. The Sonderrechte.*--In the possession of special privileges\r\nPrussia, however, is not alone. When the states of the south became\r\nmembers of the federation all of them stipulated certain\r\n_Sonderrechte_, or reserved rights, whose acknowledgment was made the\r\ncondition upon which they came into the union. Württemberg and Bavaria,\r\nfor example, retain on this basis the administration of posts and\r\ntelegraphs within their boundaries, and Württemberg, Bavaria, and\r\nBaden possess the exclusive right to tax beers and brandies produced\r\nwithin each state respectively. Bavaria retains the administration of\r\nher own railways. At one time it was feared that the special privileges\r\naccorded the southern states would constitute a menace to the stability\r\nof the Empire. Such apprehension, however, has proved largely\r\ngroundless.[296] In this connection it is worth pointing out that under\r\nthe Imperial constitution the right to commission and despatch diplomatic\r\n(though not consular) agents is not withdrawn from the individual states.\r\nIn most instances, however, the maintenance of diplomatic representatives\r\nabroad has long since been discontinued. Saxony, Bavaria, and      (p. 209)\r\nWürttemberg retain to-day only their posts at Vienna, St. Petersburg,\r\nand the Vatican.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 296: Laband, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   deutschen Reiches, §§ 11-13.]\r\n\r\n*219. Constitutional Amendment.*--It is stipulated within the Imperial\r\nconstitution that amendments may be adopted by a process identical\r\nwith that of ordinary legislative enactment, save that an amendment\r\nagainst which as many as fourteen votes are cast in the Bundesrath is\r\nto be considered rejected. The practical operation of this\r\nlast-mentioned provision is to confer upon Prussia, possessing\r\nseventeen votes and controlling twenty in the federal chamber, an\r\nabsolute veto upon all propositions looking toward constitutional\r\nchange. Clauses of the constitution whereby special rights are secured\r\nto particular states may be amended only with the consent of the\r\nstates affected.[297] In 1873, 1888, and 1893 the text of the\r\nconstitution was amended, and upon several other occasions important\r\nmodifications have been introduced in the working constitution without\r\nthe formality of altering the letter of the instrument.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 297: Art. 78. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 351.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X                                                          (p. 210)\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT: EMPEROR, CHANCELLOR, AND BUNDESRATH\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\n*220. Status and Privileges.*--Under the North German Confederation of\r\n1867-1871 the king of Prussia was vested with supreme command of the\r\nfederal navy, the functions of Bundesfeldherr, or commander-in-chief\r\nof the federal army, and a large group of purely governmental powers,\r\nincluding the summoning, proroguing, and adjourning of the Bundesrath\r\nand Bundestag, the appointment and dismissal of the Chancellor and of\r\nother federal officials, the publication of the federal laws, and a\r\ngeneral supervision of the federal administration. These powers were\r\nexercised by the king in the capacity of _Bundespræsidium_, or chief\r\nmagistrate, of the federation. Upon the accession of the south German\r\nstates in 1870-1871 Bismarck and his royal master determined to bring\r\nonce more into use in Germany the title of Emperor, although between\r\nthe empire which was now assuming form and the empire which had been\r\nterminated in 1806 there was recognized to be no historical\r\nconnection. The constitution of April 16, 1871, accordingly stipulates\r\nthat \"to the king of Prussia shall belong the presidency of the\r\nConfederation, and he shall bear the title of _Deutscher Kaiser_\r\n(German Emperor).\"[298]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 298: Art. II. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 330. It will be observed that the title is not\r\n                   \"Emperor of Germany.\" The phrase selected was\r\n                   intended to denote that the Emperor is only _primus\r\n                   inter pares_ in a confederation of territorial\r\n                   sovereigns (_Landesherren_.) He is a territorial\r\n                   sovereign only in Prussia.]\r\n\r\nThe revival of the Imperial title and dignity involved, and was\r\nintended to involve, no modification of the status of the\r\nBundespræsident, save in respect to his official designation and\r\ncertain of his personal privileges. His relations with the states and\r\nwith the princes of the federation continued precisely as before. The\r\npowers of the Kaiser were, and are, the powers of the old President,\r\nand nothing in excess of those. The title might be taken to imply a\r\nmonarchy of the customary sort; but properly it does not. There is no\r\nImperial crown, no Imperial civil list, no Imperial \"office\" as such.\r\nThe king of Prussia, in addition to his purely Prussian prerogatives,\r\nis by the Imperial constitution vested with the added prerogative  (p. 211)\r\nof bearing the Kaiser title and of exercising those powers which under\r\nthe constitution and laws are conferred upon the bearer of that title.\r\nApart from the Prussian crown the Imperial function does not exist;\r\nfrom which it follows that there is no law of Imperial succession\r\napart from the Prussian law regulating the tenure of the Prussian\r\nthrone,[299] and that in the event of a regency in Prussia the regent\r\nwould, _ipso facto_, exercise the functions of Emperor. Chief among\r\nthe privileges which belong to the Kaiser as such are those of special\r\nprotection of person and family and of absolute exemption from legal\r\nprocess. Responsible to no superior earthly authority, the Emperor may\r\nnot be brought for trial before any tribunal, nor be removed from\r\noffice by any judicial proceeding. Assaults upon his person are\r\npunishable with death, and attacks, in speech or writing, which are\r\nadjudged to constitute _lèse majesté_ are subject to special and\r\nsevere penalties.[300]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 299: Arts. 53-58 of the Prussian\r\n                   Constitution. See p. 253.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 300: R. C. Brooks, Lèse Majesté, in _The\r\n                   Bookman_, June, 1904.]\r\n\r\n*221. Powers: Military and Foreign Affairs.* The king of Prussia being\r\n_ipso facto_ Emperor, the royal and Imperial functions which are\r\ncombined in the hands of the one sovereign are of necessity closely\r\ninterrelated. There are powers which belong to William II. to-day\r\nsolely by virtue of his position as king of Prussia. There are others,\r\nof an Imperial nature, which he possesses by reason of the fact that,\r\nbeing king of Prussia, he is also Emperor. In practice, if not in law,\r\nthere are still others which arise from the thoroughgoing\r\npreponderance of the Prussian kingdom as a state within the\r\nEmpire--the power, in general, of imparting a bent to Imperial policy\r\nsuch as would not be possible if, for example, the king of Württemberg\r\nwere Emperor, rather than the king of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Emperor as such are not numerous, but, so far as\r\nthey go, they are of fundamental importance. In the first place, the\r\nEmperor is commander-in-chief of the army and navy. He may control the\r\norganization of the Landwehr, or national defense; determine the\r\nstrength and composition of the armed contingents; supervise the\r\nequipment and drilling of the troops; and mobilize the whole, or any\r\npart, of the forces.[301] A second group of Imperial functions are\r\nthose relating to foreign affairs. \"It shall be the duty of the\r\nEmperor,\" says the constitution, \"to represent the Empire among\r\nnations, to declare war and to conclude peace in the name of the\r\nEmpire, to enter into alliances and other treaties with foreign\r\ncountries, to accredit ambassadors and to receive them.\"[302] The  (p. 212)\r\nEmperor's power, however, is not in all of these directions absolute.\r\nOne important limitation arises from the requirement that, under all\r\ncircumstances save in the event of an attack upon the federal\r\nterritory or its coasts, war may be declared only with the consent of\r\nthe Bundesrath. Another is that in so far as treaties with foreign\r\ncountries relate to matters which are to be regulated by Imperial\r\nlegislation, \"the consent of the Bundesrath shall be required for\r\ntheir conclusion, and the approval of the Reichstag shall be necessary\r\nto render them valid.\"[303]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 301: Howard, The German Empire, Chap. 12;\r\n                   Laband, Deutsches Reichsstaatsrecht, 345-359.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 302: Art. II. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 330.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 303: Art. II, clause 3. Dodd, I., 331.]\r\n\r\n*222. Powers: Legislation and Justice.*--A third group of functions has\r\nto do with legislation. By the constitution the Emperor is vested with\r\nthe right to convene the Bundesrath and the Reichstag, and to open,\r\nadjourn, and close them.[304] In accordance with resolutions of the\r\nBundesrath, bills are laid before the Reichstag in the name of the\r\nEmperor; and it is the Emperor's duty to prepare and publish the laws\r\nof the Empire, as well as to supervise their execution.[305] In so far\r\nas is permitted by the constitution, and by laws from time to time\r\nenacted, decrees and ordinances may be promulgated by the Emperor,\r\nunder the countersignature of the Chancellor. Speaking strictly, the\r\nEmperor possesses no veto upon measures passed in the Bundesrath and\r\nReichstag, though in practice he may refuse to publish a law in the\r\nenactment of which he believes the ordinary formal requirements not to\r\nhave been complied with. He may not withhold a measure by reason\r\nsimply of its content.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 304: Art. 12.

On motion of the Bundesrath, he appoints\r\n(though he may not remove) the members of the Reichsgericht, or\r\nImperial Court; and by the Code of Criminal Procedure it is stipulated\r\nthat in cases in which the Imperial Court shall have rendered judgment\r\nas a tribunal of first instance, the Emperor shall possess the power\r\nof pardon. The pardoning power is extended likewise to cases adjudged\r\nin consular courts, prize courts, and other tribunals specified by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n*223. Powers: Execution of the Law.*--Finally, the execution of the laws\r\nis intrusted to the Emperor with, however, this limitation, that,\r\nunder the German system, the execution of law is committed largely to\r\nthe states and the officials thereof, so that the measures of the  (p. 213)\r\nImperial Government whose execution is not specifically provided for\r\nby the constitution and the laws are presumably carried into effect by\r\nthe constituted authorities of the states. There are, however,\r\nImperial agents whose business it is to inspect the execution of\r\nImperial measures by the states and to report to the Emperor\r\ninfractions or omissions. When such delinquencies are adjudged\r\nsufficiently serious, the Emperor may bring them to the attention of\r\nthe Bundesrath, and that body may order an \"execution,\" i.e., a show\r\nof military force to coerce the erring state. The carrying out of the\r\n\"execution\" is intrusted to the Emperor.[306] Incident to the general\r\nexecutive function is the power to make appointments. By the\r\nconstitution it is stipulated that the Emperor, in addition to\r\nappointing the Imperial Chancellor, shall appoint Imperial officials,\r\nrequire of them the taking of an oath to the Empire, and, when\r\nnecessary, dismiss them.[307] The position which the Chancellor\r\noccupies in the Imperial administrative system is of such weight that\r\nthe power of appointing to, and of removing from, the chancellorship\r\nis in itself of very large importance; and the Kaiser's control of\r\nadministration is still further increased by his power of appointment\r\nand removal of subordinate officials.[308]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 306: Art. 19.

THE CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n*224. Non-existence of a Parliamentary System.*--Within the domain of\r\nImperial government the place filled in other governmental systems by\r\na ministry or cabinet of some variety is occupied by a single official,\r\nthe _Reichskanzler_, or Chancellor. When the Imperial constitution was\r\nframed it was the intention of Bismarck to impart to the Imperial\r\nadministration the fullest facility and harmony by providing the\r\nChancellor with no colleagues, and by making that official responsible\r\nsolely to the Emperor. Such a scheme would have meant, obviously, a\r\nthoroughgoing centralization in all Imperial affairs and the utter\r\nnegation of anything in the way of a parliamentary system of government.\r\nThe more liberal members of the constituent Reichstag compelled    (p. 214)\r\na modification of the original Bismarckian programme; so that when the\r\nconstitution assumed its permanent form it contained not merely the\r\nstipulation that \"the Imperial Chancellor, to be appointed by the\r\nEmperor, shall preside in the Bundesrath and supervise the conduct of\r\nits business,\" but the significant provision that \"the decrees and\r\nordinances of the Emperor shall be issued in the name of the Empire,\r\nand shall require for their validity the countersignature of the\r\nImperial Chancellor, who thereby assumes the responsibility for\r\nthem.\"[309]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 309: Arts. 15 and 17. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 331.]\r\n\r\nNominally, this article establishes the principle of ministerial\r\nresponsibility, even though there is but a single minister to be made\r\nresponsible. Practically, it does nothing of the sort, for the reason\r\nthat no machinery whatever is provided for the enforcing of\r\nresponsibility. There is not even specification of the authority to\r\nwhich responsibility shall lie. The article stipulating\r\nresponsibility, appropriated from the constitution of Prussia, was\r\nmerely tacked on the Imperial instrument and has never been brought\r\ninto organic relation with it. In practice the Imperial Government has\r\nalways been able to do business without for a moment admitting the\r\nright of the Reichstag to unseat the Chancellor by an adverse vote.\r\nThe Chancellor may be criticised and the proposals which he introduces\r\nmay be defeated; expediency may even require his removal by his\r\nImperial master; but he has never felt obliged to retire merely by\r\nreason of lack of support in the legislative chamber, as would a\r\nBritish or a French minister similarly situated. This does not mean,\r\nof course, that the blocking of a governmental programme may not tend\r\nto produce the practical effect of a parliamentary vote of \"want of\r\nconfidence.\" It means simply that the Chancellor, in such a case, is\r\nunder no admitted obligation to resign. The retirement of Chancellor\r\nvon Bülow during the crisis of 1908-1909 was more nearly involuntary\r\nthan that of any one of his three predecessors, but persons most\r\nconversant with the circumstances agree that there was involved in it\r\nno intention of concession to the parliamentary principle. The\r\nChancellor's fall was, in reality, only his punishment for\r\ncountenancing the popular indignation occasioned by the Emperor's\r\nmemorable _Daily Telegraph_ interview, for which the Chancellor\r\nhimself had been, at least technically, responsible.[310]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 310: For an excellent discussion of this\r\n                   general subject see W. J. Shepard, Tendencies\r\n                   toward Ministerial Responsibility in Germany, in\r\n                   _American Political Science Review_, Feb., 1911. In\r\n                   the course of an impassioned speech in the\r\n                   Reichstag in 1912, occasioned by a storm of protest\r\n                   against the Emperor's alleged threat to withdraw\r\n                   the newly granted constitution of Alsace-Lorraine,\r\n                   Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg stated the theory\r\n                   and fact of the office which he holds in these\r\n                   sentences: \"No situation has been created for which\r\n                   I cannot take the responsibility. As long as I\r\n                   stand in this place I shield the Emperor (_trete\r\n                   ich vor den Kaiser_). This not for courtiers'\r\n                   considerations, of which I know nothing, but as in\r\n                   duty bound. When I cannot satisfy this my duty you\r\n                   will see me no more in this place.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is a clause of the constitution[311] which confers upon the  (p. 215)\r\nChancellor the right to delegate the power to represent him to _any\r\nother_ member of the Bundesrath; whence it seems to follow that the\r\nChancellor must be himself a member of that body. The relations of the\r\nEmpire and the Prussian kingdom practically require, further, that the\r\nChancellor be identified with the Prussian contingent in the federal\r\nchamber. Since, however, the Emperor, in his capacity of king of\r\nPrussia, designates the Prussian delegates in that body, it is open to\r\nhim to make such an appointment in this second capacity as will enable\r\nhim when selecting, in his Imperial capacity, a chancellor to procure\r\nthe services of the man he wants.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 311: Art. 15, cl. 2. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 331.]\r\n\r\n*225. Functions: in the Bundesrath and the Reichstag.*--Speaking\r\nbroadly, the functions of the Chancellor are two-fold. The first\r\narises from his position within the Bundesrath. Not only does he\r\nrepresent in that body, as do his Prussian colleagues, the king of\r\nPrussia; he is vested constitutionally with the presidency of it and\r\nwith the supervision of its business. He determines the dates of its\r\nsessions. Through his hands pass all communications and proposals,\r\nfrom the states as well as from the Reichstag, addressed to it, and he\r\nis its representative in all of its external relations. In the name of\r\nthe Emperor he lays before the Reichstag all measures enacted by the\r\nBundesrath; and as a member of the Bundesrath, though not as Imperial\r\nChancellor, he may appear on the floor of the Reichstag to advocate\r\nand explain proposed legislation. Measures which have been enacted\r\ninto law are binding only after they have been proclaimed by the\r\nChancellor, such proclamation being made regularly through the\r\nofficial organ known as the _Reichsgesetzblatt_.\r\n\r\n*226. Functions: Administration.*--A second function, so inextricably\r\nintertwined with those just mentioned as to be in practice sometimes\r\nnot clearly distinguishable from them, is that which arises from the\r\nChancellor's position as the principal administrative official of the\r\nEmpire. As has been pointed out, the work of administration under the\r\nGerman system is largely decentralized, being left to the states; but\r\nthe ultimate administrative _authority_ is very highly centralized,\r\nbeing gathered in the hands of the Chancellor in a measure not\r\nparalleled in any other nation of western Europe. As an administrative\r\nofficial the Chancellor has been described with aptness as the\r\nEmperor's \"other self.\" He is appointed by the Emperor; he may be\r\ndismissed by him; he performs his functions solely as agent and    (p. 216)\r\nassistant of the Emperor; and, although according to the letter of\r\nthe constitution responsible to the Reichstag, he is, in practice,\r\nresponsible to no one save his Imperial master.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1870 the administrative functions of the Confederation were\r\nvested in a single department, the _Bundeskanzleramt_, or Federal\r\nChancery, which was organized in three sections--the \"central office,\"\r\nthe postal office, and the bureau of telegraphs. For the time being,\r\naffairs pertaining to the army, the navy, and foreign relations were\r\nconfided to the care of the appropriate ministries of Prussia. In 1870\r\nthere was created a separate federal department of foreign affairs,\r\nand in the following year a federal department of the marine. One by\r\none other departments were established, until in 1879 the process was\r\ncompleted by the conversion of what remained of the Bundeskanzleramt\r\ninto a department of the interior. The status of these departments,\r\nhowever, was from the outset totally unlike that of the corresponding\r\nbranches of most governments. They were, and are, in effect but\r\nbureaus of the Imperial Chancellery, and their heads comprise in no\r\ndegree a collegiate ministry or cabinet. Each official in charge of a\r\ndepartment owes his position absolutely to the Chancellor, and is\r\nresponsible, not to the Reichstag, nor yet to the Emperor directly,\r\nbut to the Chancellor. Some of the more important officials bear the\r\ntitle of \"secretary of state,\" but in any case they are legally\r\nnothing more than expert and essentially non-political functionaries\r\nof the administrative hierarchy, answerable to the Chancellor for all\r\nthat they may do.[312] Of the principal departments there are at\r\npresent seven: the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the Imperial\r\nHome Office, the Department of Justice, the Imperial Treasury, the\r\nImperial Admiralty, and the Imperial Post-Office. In the nature of\r\nthings some are more important than others; and in addition to them\r\nthere are several Imperial bureaus, notably those of Railways, the\r\nBank, and the Debt Commission. Throughout all branches of the Imperial\r\nadministrative service appointments and dismissals are made regularly\r\nby the Chancellor, in the name of the Emperor, and by the same\r\nauthority all administrative regulations are promulgated.[313]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 312: At the same time it is to be\r\n                   observed that, in practice, the more important\r\n                   state secretaries are apt to sustain a relation\r\n                   with the other organs of government which is\r\n                   somewhat closer than might be inferred from what\r\n                   has been said. Not infrequently they sit in the\r\n                   Bundesrath, and are by reason of that fact\r\n                   privileged to defend their measures in person on\r\n                   the floor of the Reichstag. Not infrequently, too,\r\n                   they are members of the Prussian ministry.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 313: Laband, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   deutschen Reiches, §§ 41, 64-66.]\r\n\r\n*227. Delegation of Powers.*--There are two arrangements in accordance\r\nwith which it is possible for the functions of the Chancellor to   (p. 217)\r\nbe vested in a substitute. By the constitution the Chancellor is\r\nauthorized, as has been observed, to delegate to any other member of\r\nthe Bundesrath the power of representing him in that body; and there\r\nis a special agreement to the effect that, in such a contingency,\r\nshould no acceptable Prussian substitute be available, the choice\r\nshall fall on a Bavarian. In the second place, under statute of March\r\n17, 1878, the Chancellor is empowered to call for the appointment of a\r\nsubstitute, or substitutes, in his capacity of Imperial minister. The\r\nappointment in such a case is made, not by the Chancellor himself, but\r\nby the Emperor, and there may be designated either a general\r\nsubstitute (_Generalstellvertreter_) or a substitute for the discharge\r\nof the Chancellor's functions in some particular department\r\n(_Specialstellvertreter_).[314] In the one case there is no limit upon\r\nthe Emperor's freedom of choice; in the other, appointments must be\r\nmade from chiefs of the department or departments affected. The\r\nChancellor may at any time resume functions thus delegated.[315]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 314: The law of 1878 was enacted on the\r\n                   occasion of Bismarck's prolonged absence from\r\n                   Berlin, during his retirement at Varzin. A\r\n                   _Generalstellvertreter_ takes the title of\r\n                   _Reichsvicekanzler_, or Imperial Vice-Chancellor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 315: On the status and functions of the\r\n                   Chancellor see Howard, The German Empire, Chap. 7;\r\n                   Laband, Das Staatsrecht des deutschen Reiches, §\r\n                   40; L.

THE BUNDESRATH\r\n\r\nIf the chancellorship is without a counterpart among modern\r\ngovernments, no less so is the Federal Council, or Bundesrath. No\r\nfeature of the German political system is more extraordinary; none, as\r\none writer has observed, is more thoroughly native.[316] It is not an\r\n\"upper house,\" nor even, in the ordinary sense, a deliberative chamber\r\nat all. On the contrary, it is the central institution of the whole\r\nImperial system, and as such it is possessed of a broad combination of\r\nfunctions which are not only legislative, but administrative,\r\nconsultative, judicial, and diplomatic.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 316: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   259.]\r\n\r\n*228. Composition: the Allotment of Votes.*--The Bundesrath is composed\r\nof delegates appointed by the princes of the monarchical states and by\r\nthe senates of the free cities. In the Imperial constitution it is\r\nrequired that the fifty-eight votes to which the twenty-five states\r\nof the confederation are entitled shall be distributed in such a   (p. 218)\r\nmanner that Prussia shall have seventeen, Bavaria six, Saxony four,\r\nWürttemberg four, Baden three, Hesse three, Mecklenburg-Schwerin two,\r\nBrunswick two, and the seventeen other states one apiece.[317] Save\r\nfor the increase of the Bavarian quota from four to six and of the\r\nPrussian from four to seventeen, these numbers were simply carried\r\nover from the Diet of the Confederation of 1815. The Prussian increase\r\narose, in 1866, from the absorption of Hanover, Hesse Cassel,\r\nHolstein-Lauenburg, Nassau, and Frankfort; the Bavarian, from a\r\ncustoms union treaty of July 8, 1867. Subsequent to the adoption of\r\nthe constitution of 1871 Prussia acquired, by contract, the vote of\r\nthe government of Waldeck; also, through the establishment in\r\n1884-1885 of a perpetual Prussian regency in Brunswick, the two votes\r\nto which that state is entitled; so that the total of the votes\r\ncontrolled by the government of Prussia has been raised, for all\r\npractical purposes, to twenty.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 317: Under the Alsace-Lorraine\r\n                   Constitution Act of 1911 (see p. 285), comprising\r\n                   for all practical purposes an amendment of the\r\n                   Imperial constitution, the territory of\r\n                   Alsace-Lorraine has become nominally a state of the\r\n                   Empire, being accorded three votes in the\r\n                   Bundesrath. The whole number of votes was thus\r\n                   raised to sixty-one. The Alsatian delegates are\r\n                   appointed by the Statthalter, who is the immediate\r\n                   and responsible agent of the Emperor. Their votes\r\n                   are cast, however, under regulations which are\r\n                   inconsistent with full-fledged statehood.]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the allocation of votes for which provision\r\nwas made in the constitution of 1867-1871 was largely arbitrary. That\r\nis to say, except for the quotas of Prussia and Bavaria, it was\r\nperpetuated from the constitution of 1815 with no attempt to apportion\r\nvoting power among the several states in exact relation to population,\r\nwealth, or importance. Upon any one of these bases Prussia must have\r\nbeen accorded an absolute majority of the aggregate number, rather\r\nthan a scant third. In 1867 the population of Prussia comprised\r\nfour-fifths of that of the North German Confederation; in 1871,\r\ntwo-thirds of that of the Empire. That Prussia should intrust to her\r\nsister states a total of forty-one votes, retaining but seventeen for\r\nherself, was one of the arrangements by which Bismarck sought to\r\nassure the lesser members of the federation against too complete\r\ndomination on the part of the Prussian kingdom.\r\n\r\n*229. Status of Delegates and Method of Voting.*--Each state is\r\nauthorized, though not required, to send to the Bundesrath a number of\r\ndelegates identical with the number of votes to which the state is\r\nentitled. The full quota of members is, therefore (since the\r\nAlsace-Lorraine Constitution Act of 1911), sixty-one. Legally, and to\r\na large extent practically, the status of the delegate is that, not of\r\na senator, but of a diplomat; and the Emperor is required to       (p. 219)\r\nextend to the members of the body the \"customary diplomatic\r\nprotection.\"[318] Delegates are very commonly officials, frequently\r\nministers, of the states which they represent. They are appointed\r\nafresh for each session, and they may be recalled or replaced at any\r\ntime. The purely federal character of the Bundesrath is further\r\nemphasized by two principal facts. The members speak and act and vote\r\nregularly, not at their own discretion, but under the specific\r\ninstructions of the governing authorities by whom they are accredited.\r\nOnly rarely do their instructions allow to them any considerable\r\nmeasure of independence. Strictly, the Bundesrath is not a\r\ndeliberative assembly at all; though, unlike the former Diet, it is\r\nsomething more than a meeting of ambassadors of the states. In the\r\nsecond place, the votes cast are the votes, not of the individual\r\nmembers, but of the states, and they are cast in indivisible blocks by\r\nthe delegations of the states, regardless of the number of members in\r\nattendance. Thus, Bavaria is entitled to six votes. Whatever the\r\nindividual opinions of the six Bavarian delegates, the six Bavarian\r\nvotes are cast solidly upon any question that may arise. It is not\r\neven necessary that six delegates actually participate in the\r\ndecision. A single delegate may cast the entire quota of votes to\r\nwhich his state is entitled. The twenty votes controlled by Prussia\r\nare therefore cast invariably in a block, from which it follows that\r\nPrussia usually preponderates in the chamber. On several occasions the\r\nsmaller states have been able to combine in sufficient numbers to\r\ndefeat a project upon which Prussia was bent, but such a proceeding is\r\ndistinctly exceptional.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 318: Art. 10. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 330.]\r\n\r\n*230. Sessions and Procedure.*--The Bundesrath may be convened by the\r\nEmperor, which in effect means by the Chancellor, at any time. The\r\nconstitution stipulates that there shall be at least one session a\r\nyear, and, furthermore, that it shall be obligatory upon the Emperor\r\nto convene the body whenever a meeting is demanded by one-third of the\r\ntotal number of votes. The Bundesrath may be called together \"for the\r\npreparation of business\" without the Reichstag; but the Reichstag may\r\nnot be convened without the Bundesrath.[319] The presiding officer at\r\nall sessions is the Chancellor, or some other member of the body by\r\nhim designated as a substitute. It is within the competence of each\r\nmember of the confederation, i.e., each state, to propose measures\r\nand to introduce motions. The phraseology of the constitution debars\r\nthe Emperor, as Emperor, from introducing proposals. As king of\r\nPrussia, however, he may bring forward any project through the     (p. 220)\r\nmedium of the Prussian delegation; and in actual practice it has\r\nnot always been deemed necessary to resort to this subterfuge.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 319: Arts. 13 and 14. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 331.]\r\n\r\nFrom all sittings of the Bundesrath the public is rigorously excluded;\r\nand although ordinarily upon the conclusion of a session a statement\r\nregarding the results of the proceedings is given to the press, the\r\nchamber may vote to withhold such information altogether. Business\r\nleft unfinished at the close of a session may be resumed upon the\r\nreassembling, precisely as if no lapse of time had occurred. With some\r\nexceptions, a simple majority of the sixty-one votes is adequate for\r\nthe adoption of a measure. In the event of a tie, the Prussian\r\ndelegation possesses the deciding voice. The principal limitations\r\nupon decisions by simple majority are: (1) any proposal to amend the\r\nconstitution may be rejected by as few as fourteen votes, whence it\r\narises that Prussia has an absolute veto on amendments; and (2) when\r\nthere is a division upon proposed legislation relating to military\r\naffairs, the navy, the tariff, and various consumption taxes, the vote\r\nof Prussia prevails if it is cast in favor of maintaining the _status\r\nquo_.[320]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 320: Art. 5. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 328.]\r\n\r\n*231. Committees.*--The work of the Bundesrath consists largely in the\r\npreparation of measures for the consideration of the Reichstag, and a\r\ngoodly share of its labor is performed in committees. Of permanent\r\ncommittees there are now twelve--eight provided for within the\r\nconstitution itself and four existing by virtue of standing orders.\r\nThe committees prescribed by the constitution are those on the army\r\nand fortifications; marine; customs and taxes; commerce; railroads,\r\nposts and telegraphs; judicial affairs; accounts; and foreign\r\nrelations. Under certain limitations, each of these committees,\r\nconstituted for one year, is chosen by the Bundesrath itself, by\r\nsecret ballot, except that the Emperor appoints the members of the\r\ncommittee on the marine and all but one of the members of the\r\ncommittee on the army and fortifications.[321] The committees existing\r\nby virtue of standing orders are those on Alsace-Lorraine, railroad\r\nfreight rates, standing orders, and the constitution. All committees\r\nconsist of seven members, save those on foreign affairs and the\r\nmarine, which have five; and each includes representatives of at least\r\nfour states. Prussia holds all chairmanships, save that of the\r\ncommittee on foreign affairs, which belongs to Bavaria.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 321: Art. 8. Ibid., I., 330. Strictly,\r\n                   the Bundesrath but indicates by ballot the states\r\n                   which shall be represented on each committee,\r\n                   leaving to the states themselves the right to name\r\n                   their representatives.]\r\n\r\n*232. Powers of Legislation.*--By reason of the pivotal position   (p. 221)\r\nwhich the Bundesrath occupies in the German constitutional system the\r\nfunctions of the body are fundamental and its powers comprehensive.\r\nIts competence is in the main legislative and fiscal, but also in part\r\nexecutive and judicial. By the constitution it is stipulated that the\r\nlegislative power of the Empire shall be exercised by the Bundesrath\r\nand the Reichstag, and that a majority of the votes of both bodies\r\nshall be necessary and sufficient for the enactment of a law.[322] The\r\nright of initiating legislation is expressly conferred upon the\r\nReichstag, but in practice it is exercised almost exclusively by the\r\nBundesrath. Even finance bills all but invariably originate in the\r\nsuperior chamber. Under the normal procedure bills are prepared,\r\ndiscussed, and voted in the Bundesrath, submitted to the Reichstag for\r\nconsideration and acceptance, and returned for further scrutiny by the\r\nBundesrath before their promulgation by the Emperor. In any case, the\r\nfinal approval of a measure must take place in the Bundesrath, by\r\nwhose authority alone the character of law can be imparted. Speaking\r\nstrictly, it is the Bundesrath that makes law, with merely the assent\r\nof the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 322: Art. 5. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 328.]\r\n\r\n*233. Executive Authority.*--The Bundesrath's executive functions\r\nrepresent a curious admixture, but the sum total is very considerable.\r\nIn the first place, the body possesses supplementary administrative\r\npowers. By the constitution it is required to take action upon \"the\r\ngeneral administrative provisions and arrangements necessary for the\r\nexecution of the Imperial laws, so far as no other provision is made\r\nby law,\" as well as upon \"the defects which may be discovered in the\r\nexecution of the Imperial laws.\"[323] This function is performed\r\nthrough the issuing of ordinances so devised as not to contravene the\r\nconstitution, existing law, or the proper prerogatives of any\r\nconstituted authority, Imperial or state. In the second place, certain\r\npowers vested in the Emperor may be exercised only with the\r\nBundesrath's consent. Most important of these are: (1) the declaration\r\nof war, save in the event of an attack upon the territory or coasts of\r\nthe Empire; (2) the concluding of treaties, in so far as they relate\r\nto matters falling within the range of Imperial legislation; and (3)\r\nthe carrying out of an \"execution\" against a delinquent state. Finally\r\ncertain relations are maintained with the Reichstag which involve the\r\nexercise of authority that is essentially executive. With the assent\r\nof the Emperor, the Bundesrath may dissolve the popular chamber; and\r\nevery member of the Bundesrath has the right to appear in the      (p. 222)\r\nReichstag and to be heard there at any time upon his own request,\r\nsomewhat after the manner of a minister in a parliamentary\r\ngovernment.[324] Large functions in connection with public finance,\r\nlikewise, are vested in the body. By it the annual budget is prepared,\r\nthe accounts which the Empire carries with the states are audited, and\r\nimportant supervisory relations with the Imperial Bank, the Imperial\r\nDebt Commission, and other fiscal agencies, are maintained. Lastly,\r\nthere is some participation in the power of appointment; for although\r\nthat power, as such, is vested in the Emperor, officials of some kinds\r\n(e.g., judges of the Imperial Court) are actually chosen by the\r\nBundesrath, and in many other instances the body preserves an\r\nacknowledged right to approve appointments which are made.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 323: Art. 7. Dodd, I., 329.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 324: Arts. 9 and 24. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 330-333. It should be observed,\r\n                   however, that the members of the Bundesrath are\r\n                   authorized to appear in the Reichstag, not for the\r\n                   purpose of advocating a measure which the\r\n                   Bundesrath has enacted, or would be willing to\r\n                   enact, but simply to voice the interests or demands\r\n                   of their own states.]\r\n\r\n*234. Judicial Powers.*--In its judicial capacity the Bundesrath sits as\r\na supreme court of appeal, to which cases may be carried from the\r\ntribunals of a state, when it can be shown that justice is not to be\r\nhad in those tribunals.[325] It serves also as a court of last resort\r\nfor the settlement of disputes between the Imperial Government and a\r\nstate; or between two states, when the point at issue is not a matter\r\nof private law and when a definite request for action is made by one\r\nof the parties. Finally, in disputes relating to constitutional\r\nquestions in states whose constitution does not designate an authority\r\nfor the settlement of such differences, the Bundesrath is required, at\r\nthe request of one of the parties, to effect an amicable adjustment;\r\nor, if this shall prove impossible, to see to it that the issue is\r\nsettled by Imperial law.[326]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 325: Art. 77. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 350.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 326: Art. 76. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 350.

COMPOSITION OF THE REICHSTAG--ELECTORAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast with the Bundesrath, which is a purely federal\r\ninstitution, the Reichstag is broadly national. It represents, not the\r\nstates, nor yet the people of the states, but the people of the Empire\r\nas a whole. From what has been said regarding the preponderance of the\r\nautocratic principle in the German system it follows that there is no\r\nroom in that system for a parliamentary chamber of the nature of the\r\nBritish House of Commons or of the French Chamber of Deputies. None\r\nthe less, restricted as are its functions, the Reichstag is one of the\r\nworld's most vigorous and interesting legislative bodies.\r\n\r\n*235. Allotment of Seats.*--Members of the Reichstag are chosen for a\r\nterm of five years,[327] by direct and secret ballot, at an election\r\nwhich takes place on a given day throughout the entire Empire. The\r\nnumber of seats, fixed tentatively by the constitution of 1871 at 382,\r\nwas, by law of June 25, 1873, providing for the election of fifteen\r\nmembers from Alsace-Lorraine, increased to 397; and it thereafter\r\nremained unchanged. The electoral \"circles,\" or districts, each of\r\nwhich returns one member, were laid out originally in such a way as to\r\ncomprise 100,000 inhabitants each, and also in such a manner that no\r\ndistrict would embrace portions of two or more states. Since 1871\r\nthere has been no redistricting of the Empire, and the populations\r\ncomprising the various constituencies have become grossly unequal.\r\nBerlin, with more than two million people, is still entitled to but\r\nsix seats; and the disproportion in other great cities and densely\r\ninhabited regions is almost as flagrant.[328] There has long been\r\ndemand for a redistribution of seats; but, by reason of the proneness\r\nof urban constituencies to return to the Reichstag socialists or other\r\nradicals, the Government has never been willing to meet the        (p. 224)\r\ndemand. By states, the 397 seats are distributed as follows: Prussia,\r\n236; Bavaria, 48; Saxony, 23; Württemberg, 17; Alsace-Lorraine\r\n(Imperial territory), 15; Baden, 14; Hesse, 9; Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\n6; Saxe-Weimar, 3; Oldenburg, 3; Brunswick, 3, Hamburg, 3;\r\nSaxe-Meiningen, 2; Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, 2; Anhalt, 2; and all others,\r\none each. As in the American House of Representatives, a state is\r\nentitled to one member regardless of its population.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 327: The term, originally three years,\r\n                   was made five by a law of 1888. The modification\r\n                   went into effect with the Reichstag elected in\r\n                   February, 1890.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 328: In Conservative East Prussia the\r\n                   average number of voters in a district is 121,000;\r\n                   in Socialist Berlin it is 345,000. Twelve of the\r\n                   most populous districts represented in the\r\n                   Reichstag contain 1,950,000 voters; twelve of the\r\n                   least populous, 170,000. The district of\r\n                   Schaumburg-Lippe has but 9,891.]\r\n\r\n*236. Time and Method of Elections.*--Electoral procedure is regulated\r\nby the Election Law of May 31, 1869, amended in minor particulars at\r\nsubsequent dates, and extended in 1871 and in 1873 to the southern\r\nstates and to Alsace-Lorraine respectively. Elections are held\r\nuniformly throughout the Empire on a day fixed by the Emperor. In the\r\nevent of a dissolution prior to the end of the five-year term an\r\nelection is required to take place within a period of sixty days, and\r\nthe new Reichstag must be convened not later than ninety days after\r\nthe dissolution.[329] For election on the first ballot an absolute\r\nmajority of the votes cast within the circle, or district, is\r\nrequired. If no candidate obtains such a majority, there follows a\r\nsecond balloting (_Stichwahl_) a fortnight later, when choice is made\r\nbetween the two candidates who upon the first occasion polled the\r\nlargest number of votes. In the event of a tie, decision is by\r\nlot.[330] Secrecy of the ballot is specially safeguarded by\r\nregulations enacted April 28, 1903. Each voter, upon appearing at the\r\npolls, is furnished with an envelope and a white voting-paper bearing\r\nan official stamp. In a compartment arranged for the purpose in the\r\npolling room he marks his ballot and incloses it in the envelope. As\r\nhe leaves the room he hands the envelope to the presiding officer or\r\ndeposits it in a voting urn. Once elected, a member, according to\r\nconstitutional stipulation, is a representative, not of the\r\nconstituency that chose him, but of the people of the Empire as a\r\nwhole, and he may not be bound by any order or instruction.[331]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 329: Art. 25. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 333.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 330: By reason of the multiplicity of\r\n                   parties the number of second ballotings required is\r\n                   invariably large. In 1890 it was 138; in 1893, 181;\r\n                   in 1898, 185; in 1903, 180; in 1907, 158; and in\r\n                   1912, 191. It is calculated that the effect of\r\n                   forty per cent of the second ballotings is to\r\n                   prevent the election of the candidate obtaining\r\n                   originally the largest number of votes. The\r\n                   arrangement operates to the advantage principally\r\n                   of the National Liberals, the Radicals, and other\r\n                   essentially moderate parties, and to the\r\n                   disadvantage especially of the Social Democrats. On\r\n                   this subject see A. N. Holcombe, Direct Primaries\r\n                   and the Second Ballot, in _American Political\r\n                   Science Review_, Nov., 1911.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 331: Art. 29. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 333.]\r\n\r\n*237. The Franchise.*--The franchise is broadly democratic.        (p. 225)\r\nEvery male who, possessing citizenship in the Empire, has completed\r\nhis twenty-fifth year is entitled to vote in the district in which he\r\nhas his domicile, provided his name appears on the registration lists.\r\nHe is not required to be a citizen of the state in which he votes. The\r\nonly exceptions to the general rule of universal manhood suffrage\r\narise from the disfranchisement of persons under guardianship,\r\nbankrupts, beneficiaries of public charity, persons suffering judicial\r\ndeprivation in respect to certain of their rights as citizens, and\r\npersons in active service in the army and navy. Any male citizen,\r\npossessed of the right to vote, twenty-five years of age or over, and\r\na resident of a state of the Empire during at least one year, is\r\neligible as a candidate. He is not required to be a citizen of the\r\nstate from which he aspires to be elected.[332]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 332: On the German Imperial electoral\r\n                   system see Howard, The German Empire, Chap. 5;\r\n                   Lebon, Études sur l'Allemagne politique, 70-83;\r\n                   ibid., Étude sur la législation électorale de\r\n                   l'empire d'Allemagne, in _Bulletin de Législation\r\n                   Comparée_, 1879; G. Below, Das parlamentarische\r\n                   Wahlrecht in Deutschland (Berlin, 1909); and M. H.\r\n                   Nézard, L'Évolution du suffrage universel en Prusse\r\n                   et dans l'Empire allemand, in _Revue du Droit\r\n                   Public_, Oct.-Dec., 1904.]\r\n\r\n*238. Privileges of Members.*--Solicitous lest if members of the\r\nReichstag should be entitled to remuneration for their services the\r\npoorer classes would arrive at a preponderance in the chamber,\r\nBismarck insisted in season and out upon the non-payment of\r\nrepresentatives, and by the constitution of 1871 salaries were\r\nspecifically forbidden.[333] During the eighties the Imperial Court of\r\nAppeal ruled that the payment of socialist members by their supporters\r\nwas illegal,[334] though such payment has been in recent times not\r\nunknown. Again and again measures providing for the payment of all\r\nmembers from the Imperial treasury were passed in the Reichstag, only\r\nto be thrown out by the Bundesrath. May 21, 1906, such a measure was\r\nat last enacted by both chambers, providing for a payment of 3,000\r\nmarks a session (with a deduction of twenty-five marks for each day's\r\nabsence), and in addition free passes over German railways during, and\r\nfor eight days before and after, sessions. Upon the taking effect of\r\nthis measure, Germany became one of the several European countries in\r\nwhich, within years comparatively recent, the members of the popular\r\nlegislative chamber have been given a right to public compensation.\r\nSpecial privileges enjoyed by members are of the customary sort. No\r\nmember may at any time be held legally to account outside the chamber\r\nby reason of his utterances or his votes within it. Unless taken   (p. 226)\r\nin the commission of a misdemeanor, or during the ensuing day, a\r\nmember may not be arrested for any penal offense, or for debt, without\r\nthe consent of the chamber; and at the request of the chamber all\r\ncriminal proceedings instituted against a member, and any detention\r\nfor judicial investigation or in civil cases, must be suspended during\r\na session.[335]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 333: \"The members of the Reichstag, as\r\n                   such, shall draw no salary or compensation.\" Art.\r\n                   32.

Sessions and Officers.*--The constitution stipulates that the\r\nReichstag and the Bundesrath shall meet annually. Beyond this, and the\r\nfurther requirement that the Reichstag shall never be in session when\r\nthe Bundesrath is not, the Imperial Government is left entirely free\r\nin respect to the convening of the representative body.[336] The\r\nsummons is issued by the Emperor and the sessions are opened by him,\r\nin person or by proxy. By him the assembly may be prorogued (though\r\nnot more than once during a session, and never for a longer period\r\nthan thirty days without its own consent); by him also, with the\r\nassent of the Bundesrath, it may be dissolved.[337] The chamber\r\nvalidates the election of its members, regulates its own procedure and\r\ndiscipline, and elects its president, vice-presidents, and\r\nsecretaries.[338] Under standing orders adopted February 10, 1876, the\r\npresident and vice-president are chosen at the opening of the first\r\nsession following a general election for a temporary term of four\r\nweeks, and upon the expiration of this period an election takes place\r\nfor the remainder of the session. At the opening of each succeeding\r\nsession an election of these officials for the session takes place at\r\nonce. The secretary is chosen at the beginning of each session for the\r\nentire session.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 336: Mention has been made of the\r\n                   regulation that, following a dissolution prior to\r\n                   the end of the five-year term, the chamber shall be\r\n                   convoked within ninety days. It will be recalled,\r\n                   also, that the Bundesrath may be convoked without\r\n                   the Reichstag.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 337: Nominally by a resolution of the\r\n                   Bundesrath, with the consent of the Emperor. Art.\r\n                   24. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 333.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 338: Art. 27. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n*240. Abtheilungen and Committees.*--At the opening of a session the\r\nentire membership of the Reichstag is divided by lot into seven\r\nAbtheilungen, or bureaus, as nearly equal as it is possible to make\r\nthem. The bureaus of the French Chamber of Deputies are reconstituted\r\nonce a month, and those of the Italian once in two months, but those\r\nof the Reichstag are maintained unchanged throughout a session, unless\r\nupon motion of as many as thirty members the body decides upon a fresh\r\ndistribution. The functions of the bureaus comprise, in the main,  (p. 227)\r\nthe passing upon the credentials of members of the chamber and\r\nthe designating of members of committees. There is in the Reichstag\r\nbut one standing committee--that on elections. It is perpetuated\r\nthroughout a session. All other committees are made up, as occasion\r\nrequires, by the appointment by ballot of an equal number of members\r\nby each of the seven bureaus; although, in point of fact, the\r\npreparation of committee lists falls largely to the party leaders of\r\nthe chamber. The function of committees is the preliminary\r\nconsideration of measures and the reporting of them and of evidence\r\nrelating to them, to the chamber, Bills are not, however, in all cases\r\nreferred to committees.\r\n\r\n*241. Methods of Business.*--Measures proposed for enactment pass\r\nthrough the three readings which have come to be customary among\r\nmodern legislative assemblies. Debate is carried on under regulations\r\nclosely resembling those which prevail in the British House of Commons\r\nand distinctly less restrictive than those in vogue in the French\r\nChamber of Deputies. Members of the Bundesrath, to whom is assigned a\r\nspecial bench, possess the right to appear and to speak at pleasure.\r\nDebaters address the chamber from the tribune or from their seats as\r\nthey choose, and they speak whenever they can secure the recognition\r\nof the presiding official, not, as in France, in the hard and fast\r\norder indicated by a previously prepared written list. Like the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, the president of the Reichstag is a\r\nstrictly non-partisan moderator. A fixed tradition of the office is\r\nthat during debate the chair shall recognize alternately the\r\nsupporters and the opponents of the measure under consideration. As a\r\ngeneral rule, closure of debate may be ordered upon the initiative of\r\nthirty members.\r\n\r\nUnlike the sittings of the Bundesrath, which take place invariably\r\nbehind closed doors, those of the Reichstag are, by constitutional\r\nprovision, public. Under the standing orders, however, the body may go\r\ninto secret session, on motion of the president, or of ten members.\r\nPublicity is further assured by the constitutional stipulation that\r\n\"no one shall be held responsible for truthful reports of the\r\nproceedings of the public sessions of the Reichstag.\"[339] Measures\r\nare carried by absolute majority; and, while discussion may proceed in\r\nthe absence of a quorum, no vote or other action is valid unless there\r\nis present a majority of the full membership of the body, that is,\r\nsince 1873, 199.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 339: Art. 22. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 333.]\r\n\r\n*242. Powers.*--The legislative power of the Empire is vested in the\r\nReichstag and the Bundesrath conjointly, and a majority of the votes\r\nof both bodies is necessary for the enactment of a law. So declares\r\nthe constitution. The legislative functions of the popular chamber (p. 228)\r\nare, however, in practice distinctly subordinate to those of the\r\nBundesrath. The Reichstag possesses no such power of legislative\r\ninitiative and discretion as is possessed by the popular chambers of\r\nGreat Britain, France, Italy, and the United States. Its consent is\r\nnecessary for the enactment of every law, for the adoption of every\r\nconstitutional amendment, and for the ratification of every treaty\r\naffecting matters within the domain of Imperial legislation. But\r\nbills, including those relating to finance, originate ordinarily with\r\nthe Chancellor and the Bundesrath; the procedure followed in the\r\nshaping of revenue and military measures puts the Reichstag distinctly\r\nat a disadvantage; and, at the best, the part which the chamber can\r\nplay in the public policy of the Empire is negative and subsidiary. It\r\ncan block legislation and discuss at length the policy of the\r\nGovernment, but it is not vested by the constitution with power\r\nsufficient to make it an effective instrument of control. It is within\r\nthe competence of the Bundesrath, with the assent of the Emperor, to\r\ndissolve the popular chamber at any time, and, as has been pointed\r\nout, such action is taken without an iota of the ministerial\r\nresponsibility which in other nations ordinarily accompanies the right\r\nof dissolution. On several occasions since 1871 the Reichstag has been\r\ndissolved with the sheer intent of putting an end to its\r\nobstructionism.[340]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 340: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   257.]\r\n\r\nThe standing orders of the chamber make mention of the right of\r\ninterpellation, and resort is occasionally had to this characteristic\r\ncontinental legislative practice. There are no ministers, however, to\r\nwhom an interpellation may be addressed except the Chancellor, and\r\neven he has no right to appear in the Reichstag save as a member of\r\nthe Bundesrath. The consequence is that interpellations are addressed,\r\nin practice, to the Bundesrath. It is only where the parliamentary\r\nsystem prevails, as in France and Italy, that the device of\r\ninterpellation can be made to assume much importance. The possibility\r\nof a larger opportunity for interpellation, which should involve the\r\nright of the chamber to adopt resolutions declaring satisfaction or\r\ndissatisfaction with the answer made, was warmly, but on the whole\r\ninconclusively, discussed in the Reichstag in 1912.[341]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 341: On the Reichstag see Howard, The\r\n                   German Empire, Chap. 5; A.

THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES                                 (p. 229)\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as in continental countries generally, the number of\r\npolitical groups is legion. Many are too small and unstable to be\r\nentitled properly to the designation of parties; and, in truth, of\r\neven the larger ones none has ever become so formidable numerically as\r\nto acquire a majority in the popular chamber. For the enactment of\r\nmeasures the Government is obliged to rely always upon some sort of\r\ncoalition, or, at best, upon the members of a group which for the time\r\nbeing holds the balance between two opposing alignments.\r\n\r\n*243. Conservatives and Progressives.*--The party situation of the\r\npresent day has been reached in consequence of the gradual\r\ndisintegration of the two great political groups with which Prussia\r\nentered upon the period of Bismarck's ministry; and to this day the\r\nparties of the German Empire and those of the Prussian kingdom are\r\nlargely identical.[342] The two original Prussian groups were the\r\nConservatives and the Fortschritt, or Progressives, of which the one\r\ncomprised, throughout the middle portion of the nineteenth century,\r\nthe supporters of the Government and the other its opponents. The\r\nConservatives were pre-eminently the party of the landed aristocracy\r\nof northern and eastern Germany. During twenty years prior to 1867\r\nthey dominated completely the Prussian court and army. Following the\r\nAustrian war of 1866, however, the Conservative ascendancy was broken\r\nand there set in that long process of party dissolution by which\r\nGerman political life has been brought to its present confused\r\ncondition. To begin with, each of the two original parties broke into\r\ntwo distinct groups. From the Conservatives sprang the Frei\r\nConservativen, or Free Conservatives; from the Fortschritt, the\r\nNational-Liberal-Partei, or National Liberals. In the one case the new\r\ngroup comprised the more advanced element of the old one; in the\r\nother, the more moderate; so that, in the order of radicalism, the\r\nparties of the decade following 1866 were the Conservatives, the Free\r\nConservatives, the National Liberals, and the Fortschrittspartei, or\r\nRadicals. Among these four groups Bismarck was able to win for his\r\npolicy of German unification the support of the more moderate, that is\r\nto say, the second and third. The ultra-Conservatives clung to the\r\nparticularistic régime of earlier days, and with them the genius of\r\n\"blood and iron\" broke definitely in 1866. The Free Conservatives\r\ncomprised at the outset simply those elements of the original      (p. 230)\r\nConservative party who were willing to follow Bismarck.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 342: To so great an extent is this true\r\n                   that, having described in this place the parties of\r\n                   the Empire, it will not be necessary subsequently\r\n                   to allude at length to those of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n*244. Rise and Preponderance of the National Liberals.*--Similarly among\r\nthe Progressives there was division upon the attitude to be assumed\r\ntoward the Bismarckian programme. The more radical wing of the party,\r\ni.e., that which maintained the name and the policies of the original\r\nFortschritt, refused to abandon its opposition to militarism and\r\nmonarchism, opposed the constitution of 1867 for its illiberality, and\r\nwithheld from Bismarck's government all substantial support. The\r\nlarger portion of the party members, however were willing to\r\nsubordinate for a time to Bismarck's nationalizing projects the\r\ncontest which the united Fortschritt had long been waging in behalf of\r\nconstitutionalism. The party of no compromise was strongest in Berlin\r\nand the towns of east Prussia. It was almost exclusively Prussian. The\r\nNational Liberals, on the contrary, became early an essentially\r\nGerman, rather than simply a Prussian, party. Even before 1871 they\r\ncomprised, in point both of numbers and of power, the preponderating\r\nparty in both Prussia and the Confederation as a whole; and after\r\n1871, when the Nationalists of the southern states cast in their lot\r\nwith the National Liberals, the predominance of that party was\r\neffectually assured. Upon the National Liberals as the party of unity\r\nand uniformity Bismarck relied absolutely for support in the\r\nupbuilding of the Empire. It was only in 1878, after the party had\r\nlost control of the Reichstag, in consequence of the reaction against\r\nLiberalism attending the great religious contest known as the\r\nKulturkampf, that the Chancellor was in a position to throw off the\r\nnot infrequently galling bonds of the Liberal alliance.\r\n\r\n*245. The Newer Groups: the Centre.*--Meanwhile the field occupied by\r\nthe various parties that have been named was, from an early date, cut\r\ninto by an increasing number of newly organized parties and groups.\r\nMost important among these were the Clericals, or Centre, and the\r\nSocial Democrats. The origins of the Centre may be traced to the\r\nproject which was formulated in December, 1870, to found a new party,\r\na party which should be essentially Catholic, and which should have\r\nfor its purpose the defense of society against radicalism, of the\r\nstates against the central government, and of the schools against\r\nsecularization. A favorite saying of the founders was that \"at the\r\nbirth of the Empire Justice was not present.\" The party, gaining\r\nstrength first in the Rhenish and Polish provinces of Prussia and in\r\nBavaria, was able in the elections of 1871 to win a total of sixty\r\nseats. Employed by the Catholic clergy during the decade that followed\r\nto maintain the cause of the papacy against the machinations of\r\nBismarck, the party early struck root deeply; and by reason of     (p. 231)\r\nthe absolute identification in the public mind of its interests\r\nwith the interests of the Catholic Church, ensuring its preponderance\r\nin the states of the south, and also by reason of the fact that it has\r\nalways been more successful than any of its rivals in maintaining\r\ncompactness of organization, it became, and has continued almost\r\nuninterruptedly to the present time, the strongest numerically of all\r\npolitical groups within the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n*246. The Newer Groups: the Social Democrats.*--The Social Democratic\r\nparty was founded in 1869 under the leadership of Wilhelm Liebknecht\r\nand August Bebel. In 1863 there had been organized at Leipzig, under\r\nthe inspiration of the eloquent Marxist Ferdinand Lassalle, a\r\nUniversal German Workingman's Association. Between the two bodies\r\nthere was for a time keen rivalry, but at a congress held at Gotha, in\r\nMay, 1875, they (together with a number of other socialistic\r\nsocieties) were merged in one organization, which has continued to\r\nthis day to be known as the Social Democratic party. The development\r\nof socialism in the Empire between 1870 and 1880, in respect to both\r\nnumbers and efficiency of organization, was phenomenal. At the\r\nparliamentary elections of 1871 the Social Democratic vote was 124,655\r\n(three per cent of the total) and two Social Democrats were chosen to\r\nthe Reichstag. In 1874 the popular vote was 351,952, and nine members\r\nwere elected; in 1877 it was 493,288, and the number of successful\r\ncandidates was twelve. By the Emperor William I. and by his\r\nchancellor; Bismarck, as indeed by the governing and well-to-do\r\nclasses generally, the progress of the movement was viewed with\r\nfrankly avowed apprehension. Most of the great projects of the\r\nImperial Government were opposed by the Social Democrats, and the\r\nmembers of the party were understood to be enemies of the entire\r\nexisting order, and even of civilization itself. Two attempts in 1878\r\nupon the life of the Emperor, made by men who were socialists, but\r\ndisavowed by the socialists as a body, afforded the authorities an\r\nopportunity to enter upon a campaign of socialist repression, and from\r\n1878 to 1890 anti-socialist legislation of the most thoroughgoing\r\ncharacter was regularly on the statute books and was in no slight\r\nmeasure enforced. At the same time that effort was being made to stamp\r\nout socialist propaganda a remarkable series of social reforms was\r\nundertaken with the deliberate purpose not only of promoting the\r\npublic well-being, but of cutting the ground from under the\r\nsocialists' feet, or, as some one has observed, of \"curing the Empire\r\nof socialism by inoculation.\" The most important steps taken in this\r\ndirection comprised the inauguration of sickness insurance in 1883, of\r\naccident insurance in 1884, and of old-age and invalidity insurance in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nFor a time the measures of the government seemed to accomplish     (p. 232)\r\ntheir purpose, and the official press loudly proclaimed that socialism\r\nin Germany was extinct. In reality, however, socialism thrived on\r\npersecution. In the hour of Bismarck's apparent triumph the socialist\r\npropaganda was being pushed covertly in every corner of the Empire. A\r\nparty organ known as the _Social Democrat_ was published in\r\nSwitzerland, and every week thousands of copies found their way across\r\nthe border and were passed from hand to hand among determined readers\r\nand converts. A compact organization was maintained, a treasury was\r\nestablished and kept well filled, and with truth the Social Democrats\r\naver to-day that in no small measure they owe their superb\r\norganization to the Bismarckian era of repression. At the elections of\r\n1878 the party cast but 437,158 votes, but in 1884 its vote was\r\n549,990 (9.7 per cent of the whole) and the contingent of\r\nrepresentatives returned to the Reichstag numbered twenty-four. In\r\n1890 the socialist vote attained the enormous total of 1,427,298 (19.7\r\nper cent of the whole), and the number of representatives was\r\nincreased to thirty-five. Repression was manifestly a failure, and in\r\n1890 the Reichstag, with the sanction of the new emperor, William II.,\r\nwisely declined to renew the statute under which proscription had been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n*247. Minor Parties.*--Aside from the Centre and the Social Democrats,\r\nthe newer party groups in Germany--the Guelfs, the Poles, the Danes,\r\nthe Alsatians, the Antisemites, etc.--are small and relatively\r\nunimportant. All are particularistic and irreconcilable; all are\r\norganized on the basis of local, racial, or religious interests.\r\nApart, indeed, from the National Liberals and the Socialists, it\r\ncannot be said that any one of the German political groups, large or\r\nsmall, is broadly national, in either its tenets or its constituency.\r\nThe Guelfs, or Hanoverische Rechtspartei, comprise the irreconcilables\r\namong the old Hanoverian nobility who refuse to recognize the validity\r\nof the extinction of the ancient Hanoverian dynasty by the deposing of\r\nGeorge V. in 1866. As late as 1898 they returned to the Reichstag nine\r\nmembers. In 1903 they elected but five, and in 1907 their\r\nrepresentation was reduced to a single deputy. In 1912 their quota\r\nbecame again five. The Poles comprise the Slavic voters of the\r\ndistricts of West Prussia, Posen, and Silesia, who continue to send to\r\nthe Reichstag members who protest against the incorporation of the\r\nPoles in Prussia and in the Empire. At the elections of 1903 they\r\nsecured sixteen seats, at those of 1907 twenty, and at those of 1912\r\neighteen. The Danes of northern Schleswig keep up some demand for\r\nannexation to Denmark, and measures looking toward Germanization are\r\nwarmly resented; but the number of people concerned--not more than\r\n150,000--is so small that their political power is almost _nil_.   (p. 233)\r\nThey have, as a rule, but a single spokesman in the Reichstag. The\r\nAlsatians comprise the autonomists of Alsace-Lorraine, and the\r\nAntisemites form a group whose original purpose was resistance to\r\nJewish influence and interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PARTY POLITICS AFTER 1878\r\n\r\n*248. Shifting \"Government\" Parties.*--To rehearse here the details of\r\nGerman party history during the period since the Government's break\r\nwith the Liberals in 1878 is impossible. A few of the larger facts\r\nonly may be mentioned. Between 1878 and 1887 there was in the\r\nReichstag no one great party, nor even any stable coalition of\r\nparties, upon which the Government could rely for support. For the\r\ntime being, in 1879, Bismarck allied with the Centre to bring about\r\nthe adoption of his newly-framed policy of protection and of the\r\nfamous Frankenstein clause relative to the matricular contributions of\r\nthe states.[343] The National Liberals, left in the lurch, broke up,\r\nand in 1881 the remnant of the party was able to obtain only\r\nforty-five seats. After the elections of that year the Centre\r\ncommanded in the Reichstag a plurality of forty. The upshot was that,\r\nin the effort to procure the dependable support of the Centre, the\r\nGovernment gradually abandoned the Kulturkampf, and for a time the\r\nCentre virtually succeeded to the position occupied prior to 1878 by\r\nthe National Liberals. The elections of 1887, however, again changed\r\nthe situation. The Centre retained a plurality of some twenty seats,\r\nbut the Conservatives, Free Conservatives, and National Liberals\r\nformed a coalition and between them obtained a total of 220 seats and,\r\naccordingly, the control of the Reichstag. Thereupon the Conservatives\r\nbecame the Government's principal reliance and the Centre dropped for\r\na time into a position of neutrality. At the elections of 1890 the\r\ncoalition, which in truth had been built up by the Government on the\r\nbasis of a cartel, or agreement, suffered heavy losses. Of 397 seats\r\nit carried only 130,[344] while the Centre alone procured 116.\r\nCoincident with the overturn came the dismissal of Bismarck and the\r\nelevation to the chancellorship of General von Caprivi. Throughout his\r\nyears of office (1890-1894) Caprivi was able to rely habitually upon\r\nthe support of no single party or group of parties, and for the\r\nenactment of its measures the Government was obliged to seek       (p. 234)\r\nassistance now in one quarter and now in another, according as\r\ncircumstances dictated.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 343: This measure provided that each year\r\n                   all proceeds from the Imperial customs and tobacco\r\n                   tax in excess of 130,000,000 marks should be\r\n                   distributed among the several states in proportion\r\n                   to their population. Its author was Frankenstein, a\r\n                   leader of the Centre.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 344: Conservatives 65, Free Conservatives\r\n                   24, National Liberals 41.]\r\n\r\n*249. The Agrarian Movement and the Rise of the Bloc.*--Two or three\r\ndevelopments of the period stand out with some distinctness. One was\r\nthe break-up, apparently for all time, of the Fortschrittspartei, or\r\nRadical party, in consequence of the elections of 1893. A second was\r\nthe rise of the Government's prolonged contest with the Agrarians. The\r\nAgrarian group, of which indeed one hears as early as 1876, comprised\r\nprincipally the grain-growing landholders of northern and eastern\r\nGermany. By treaties concluded in 1892-1894 with Austria-Hungary,\r\nItaly, Belgium, Russia, and other nations, German import duties on\r\ngrain were considerably reduced in return for advantages given to\r\nGerman manufacturers. Low duties meant cheap foodstuffs, and in the\r\nnegotiation of these treaties the Government found itself supported\r\nwith enthusiasm not only by the Centre, but also by the Social\r\nDemocrats and the surviving Radicals. The Conservatives were divided.\r\nThose of Agrarian sympathies (especially the Prussian landholders)\r\nallied themselves with the forces of opposition. But the remainder\r\ngave the Government some measure of support. And from this\r\nlast-mentioned fact arose a final political development of large\r\nsignificance during the Caprivi period, namely, the creation of that\r\n_bloc_, or affiliation, of Centre and Conservatives (popularly\r\nreferred to as the \"blue-black\" _bloc_) upon which the Government was\r\ndestined regularly to rely through upwards of a decade and a half.\r\nDuring the chancellorship of Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst\r\n(1894-1900) the struggle with the Agrarians was continued and the\r\npreponderance of the _bloc_ became an established fact. Finally,\r\nshould be mentioned the rapidly accelerating growth of the Social\r\nDemocracy. In 1893 the popular party cast a total of 1,876,738 votes\r\nand elected forty-four representatives. In 1896 its vote was 2,007,076\r\nand the number of members elected was fifty-seven. In 1903 its vote\r\nrose to the enormous proportions of 3,008,000 (24 per cent of the\r\ntotal, and larger than that of any other single party), and the quota\r\nin the Reichstag was increased to seventy-nine.\r\n\r\n*250. The Elections of 1903 and 1907.*--At the elections of 1903 the\r\n_bloc_ suffered numerically a loss of strength. The Centre obtained\r\n102 seats, the Conservatives 53, and the Free Conservatives, or \"Party\r\nof the Empire,\" 22--an aggregate of only 177. By deft management,\r\nhowever, Chancellor von Bülow (1900-1908) contrived to play off\r\nthrough several years the opposing forces, and so to preserve, for all\r\npractical purposes, the working efficiency of the Government\r\ncoalition. The elections of January, 1907, brought on by a dissolution\r\nof the Reichstag after the refusal of that body to vote the        (p. 235)\r\nGovernment's colonial estimates, were of interest principally by\r\nreason of the continued show of strength of the Centre and the falling\r\noff of the Social Democrats in their representation in the Reichstag.\r\nIn the practical working out of political forces it had come about\r\nthat the Centre occupied in the chamber a pivotal position of such\r\nconsequence that the Government was in effect absolutely dependent\r\nupon the vote of that party for the enactment of its measures.\r\nNaturally enough, the party, realizing its power, was prone to put its\r\nsupport upon a contractual basis and to drive with the Government a\r\nhard bargain for the votes which it commanded. While hardly in a\r\nposition to get on without Clerical assistance, the Government in 1907\r\nwould have been willing enough to see the Centre's power and\r\nindependence broken. Not only, however, did the Centre not lose seats\r\nby that contest; it in fact realized a gain of two. On the other hand,\r\nthere was compensation for the Government in the fact that the Social\r\nDemocrats fell back. They polled a total of 3,250,000 popular votes,\r\nas compared with 3,008,000 in 1903; but by reason of the antiquated\r\ndistribution of seats which prevails in the Empire, the unusual vote\r\npolled by other parties, and also the unusual co-operation of the\r\nparty groups opposed to the Social Democrats, their representation in\r\nthe Reichstag was cut from 79 to 43.[345]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 345: The total number of popular votes\r\n                   cast in the election was 10,857,000, of which\r\n                   number government candidates received 4,962,000,\r\n                   and opposition candidates 5,895,000.

PARTIES SINCE 1907                                              (p. 236)\r\n\r\n*251. The Bülow Bloc.*--The period covered by the life of the Reichstag\r\nelected in 1907 was remarkable in German political history chiefly by\r\nreason of the prolonged struggle for the establishment of\r\nparliamentary government which took place within it--a struggle which\r\nhad its beginning, indeed, in the deadlock by which the dissolution of\r\n1906 was occasioned, which reached its climax in the fiscal debates of\r\n1908-1909, and which during the years that followed gradually\r\nsubsided, leaving both the status of parties and the constitutional\r\norder of the Empire essentially as they were at the beginning. Even\r\nbefore the dissolution of 1906 the Conservative-Centre _bloc_ was\r\neffectually dissolved, principally by the defection of the Centre, and\r\nthrough upwards of three years it was replaced by an affiliation,\r\nknown commonly as the \"_Bülow bloc_,\" of the Conservatives and the\r\nLiberals. This combination, however, was never substantial, and in the\r\ncourse of the conflict over the Government's proposed budget of\r\nNovember, 1908, there was a return to the old alignment, and\r\nthroughout ensuing years the Conservative-Clerical _bloc_ remained a\r\npreponderating factor in the political situation.\r\n\r\n*252. The Elections of 1912: Parties and Issues.*--The Reichstag of 1907\r\nwas dissolved at the termination of its five-year period, and in\r\nJanuary, 1912, there was elected a new chamber, the thirteenth since\r\nthe creation of the Empire. The contest was pre-eminently one of\r\nmeasures rather than of men, but the public interest which it excited\r\nwas extraordinary. Broadly, the line was drawn between the Government\r\nand the parties of the _bloc_, on the one hand, and the more purely\r\npopular parties, especially the National Liberals, the Radicals, and\r\nthe Social Democrats, on the other;[346] and the issues were chiefly\r\nsuch as were supplied by the spirit, purposes, and methods of\r\nChancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg and his Conservative-Clerical allies.\r\nOf the alleged reactionism of the Government parties there was\r\nwidespread complaint. They were held responsible for the fiscal reform\r\nof 1909 which imposed burdens unduly heavy on industry and commerce,\r\nwhile sparing land and invested capital; they were charged with\r\nre-establishing the yoke of the Catholic Centre upon the Lutheran  (p. 237)\r\nmajority; and they were reproached for having failed to redeem their\r\npromise to liberalize the antiquated franchise arrangements of\r\nPrussia. The Conservatives in particular were attacked on the ground\r\nof their continued monopoly of patronage and of power. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the most important of practical issues was that of the\r\ntariff. Throughout a twelvemonth discontent occasioned by the high\r\ncost of living had been general and the Government had been besought\r\nby municipalities, workingmen's organizations, and political societies\r\nto inaugurate a project for the reduction of the duties imposed upon\r\nimported foodstuffs. The demand was in vain and the country was given\r\nto understand by the Chancellor that the Government, under\r\nConservative-Agrarian mastery, would stand or fall with \"protection\r\nfor the nation's work\" as its battle-cry. Upon this question the\r\nNational Liberals, being protectionist by inclination, stood with the\r\nGovernment, but the Radicals, the Social Democrats, and some of the\r\nminor groups assumed an attitude of clear-cut opposition.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 346: The gravest abuse in connection with\r\n                   the conduct of campaigns and elections in Germany\r\n                   is the pressure which the Government brings to bear\r\n                   systematically upon the enormous official\r\n                   population and upon railway employees (alone\r\n                   numbering 600,000) to vote Conservative, or, in\r\n                   districts where there is no Conservative candidate,\r\n                   Centrist. This pressure is applied through the\r\n                   local bureaucratic organs, principally the Landrath\r\n                   of the Kreis, who not uncommonly is a youthful\r\n                   official of noble origin, related to some important\r\n                   landed family, and a rigid Conservative. It has\r\n                   been estimated that official influence controls a\r\n                   million votes at every national election.]\r\n\r\n*253. The Results and Their Significance.*--The total number of\r\ncandidates in the 397 constituencies was 1,428. The Social Democrats\r\nalone had a candidate in every constituency, a fact which emphasizes\r\nthe broadly national character which that party has acquired. The\r\nNational Liberals had candidates in 200 constituencies, the Centre in\r\n183, the Radicals in 175, and the Conservatives in 132. A second\r\nballot was required in 191 constituencies, or nearly one-half of the\r\nwhole number. The final results of the election justified completely\r\nthe general expectation of observers that the Social Democrats would\r\nrealize enormous gains. The appeal of von Bethmann-Hollweg for\r\nsolidarity against the Socialists had no such effect as did the\r\nsimilar appeal of von Bülow in 1907. The tactfulness and personal hold\r\nof the Chancellor was inferior to that of his predecessor, and the\r\nmass of the nation was aroused in 1912 as it was not upon the earlier\r\noccasion. The results may be tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   _Seats_           _Seats acquired_\r\n                                _at dissolution_  _by elections of 1912_\r\n\r\n  Centre                                103               90\r\n  Conservatives                          58               45\r\n  Free Conservatives                     25               13\r\n  Social Democrats                       53              110\r\n  National Liberals                      51               44\r\n  Radicals                               49               41\r\n  Poles                                  20               18\r\n  Antisemites and Economic Union         20               11\r\n  Guelfs or Hanoverians                   1                5\r\n  Alsatians, Danes, and Independents     16               20\r\n                                        ___              ___\r\n  Total                                 397              397\r\n\r\nTwo of the three parties of the Left, i.e., the National Liberals  (p. 238)\r\nand the Radicals, suffered substantial losses, but the victory of the\r\nSocial Democrats was so sweeping that there accrued to the Left as a\r\nwhole a net gain of forty-two seats.[347] On the other hand, the three\r\nparties of the _bloc_ lost heavily--in the aggregate thirty-eight\r\nseats. The number of popular votes cast for candidates of the _bloc_\r\nwas approximately 4,500,000; that for candidates of the Left\r\napproximately 7,500,000.[348] In Berlin, five of whose six constituencies\r\nwere represented already by Social Democrats, there was a notable\r\nattempt on the part of the socialists to carry the \"Kaiser district\"\r\nin which is located the Kaiserhof, or Imperial residence, and the seat\r\nof the Government itself. The attempt failed, but it was only at the\r\nsecond ballot, and by the narrow margin of seven votes, that the\r\nsocialist candidate was defeated by his Radical opponent. As has been\r\npointed out, the parties of the Left are entirely separate and they\r\nare by no means able always to combine in action upon a public\r\nquestion. The ideal voiced by the publicist Naumann, \"from Bassermann\r\nto Bebel,\" meaning that the National Liberals under the leadership of\r\nBassermann should, through the medium of the Radicals, amalgamate for\r\npolitical purposes with the Social Democrats under Bebel, has not as\r\nyet been realized. None the less there has long been community of\r\ninterest and of policy, and the elections of 1912 made it possible for\r\nthe first time for a combination of the three groups and their allies\r\nto outweigh decisively any combination which the parties of the _bloc_\r\nand their allies can oppose. Before the election there was a clear\r\nGovernment majority of eighty-nine; after it, an opposition majority\r\nof, at the least, fourteen. When, in February, 1912, the new Reichstag\r\nwas opened, it was only by the most dexterous tactics on the part of\r\nthe _bloc_ that the election of the socialist leader Bebel to the\r\npresidency of the chamber was averted.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 347: Many of the socialist victories\r\n                   were, of course, at the expense of the National\r\n                   Liberals and Radicals.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 348: The number of electors inscribed on\r\n                   the lists was 14,236,722. The number who actually\r\n                   voted was 12,188,337. The exact vote of the Social\r\n                   Democrats was 4,238,919; of the National Liberals,\r\n                   1,671,297; of the Radicals, 1,556,549; of the\r\n                   Centre, 2,012,990; and of the Conservatives,\r\n                   1,149,916.]\r\n\r\n*254. The Parties To-day: Conservatives and Centre.*--The principal\r\neffect of the election would seem to be to accentuate the already\r\nmanifest tendency of Germany to become divided between two great\r\nhostile camps, the one representative of the military, bureaucratic,\r\nagrarian, financial classes and, in general, the forces of resistance\r\nto change, the other representative of modern democratic forces,\r\nextreme and in principle even revolutionary. Leaving out of account\r\nthe minor particularist groups, the most reactionary of existing\r\nparties is the Conservatives, whose strength lies principally in   (p. 239)\r\nthe rural provinces of Prussia along the Baltic. The most radical is\r\nthe Social Democrats, whose strength is pretty well diffused through\r\nthe states of the Empire but is massed, in the main, in the cities.\r\nBetween the two stand the Centre, the Radicals, and the National\r\nLiberals. The Centre has always included both an aristocratic and a\r\npopular element, being, indeed, more nearly representative of all\r\nclasses of people in the Empire than is any other party. Its numerical\r\nstrength is drawn from the peasants and the workingmen, and in order\r\nto maintain its hold in the teeth of the appeal of socialism it has\r\nbeen obliged to make large concessions in the direction of liberalism.\r\nAt all points except in respect to the interests of the Catholic\r\nChurch it has sought to be moderate and progressive, and it should be\r\nobserved that it has abandoned long since its irreconcilable attitude\r\non religion. Geographically, its strength lies principally in the\r\nsouth, especially in Bavaria.\r\n\r\n*255. The Social Democrats.*--Nominally revolutionary, the German Social\r\nDemocracy comprises in fact a very orderly organization whose\r\neconomic-political tenets are at many points so rational that they\r\ncommand wide support among people who do not bear the party name.\r\nThroughout a generation the party has grown steadily more practical in\r\nits demands and more opportunist in its tactics. Instead of opposing\r\nreforms undertaken on the basis of existing institutions, as it once\r\nwas accustomed to do, in the hope of bringing about the establishment\r\nof a socialistic state by one grand _coup_, it labors for such reforms\r\nas are adjudged attainable and contents itself with recurring only\r\noccasionally and incidentally to its ultimate ideal. The supreme\r\ngoverning authority of the party is a congress composed of six\r\ndelegates from each electoral district of the Empire, the socialist\r\nmembers of the Reichstag, and the members of the party's executive\r\ncommittee. This congress convenes annually to regulate the\r\norganization of the party, to discuss party policies, and to take\r\naction upon questions submitted by the party members. Nominally, the\r\nprinciples of the party are those of Karl Marx, and its platform is\r\nthe \"Erfurt programme\" of 1891, contemplating the abolition of class\r\ngovernment and of classes themselves, the termination of every kind of\r\nexploitation of labor and oppression of men, the destruction of\r\ncapitalism, and the inauguration of an economic régime under which the\r\nproduction and distribution of goods shall be controlled by the state\r\nexclusively. The Radical Socialists, i.e., the old-line members of the\r\nparty, cling to these time-honored articles of faith. But the mass of\r\nthe younger element of the party, ably led by Edward Bernstein--the\r\n\"Revisionists,\" as they call themselves--consider that the Marxist\r\ndoctrines are in numerous respects erroneous, and they are insisting\r\nthat the Erfurt programme shall be overhauled and brought into     (p. 240)\r\naccord with the practical and positive spirit of the party to-day.\r\nExcept Bebel and Kautsky, every socialist leader of note in Germany at\r\nthe present time is identified with the revisionist movement.[349] The\r\npolitical significance of this situation arises from the fact that the\r\n\"new socialists\" stand ready to co-operate systematically with\r\nprogressive elements of whatsoever name or antecedents. Already the\r\nsocialists of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria have voted for the local\r\nstate budgets and have participated in court functions, and upon\r\nnumerous occasions they have worked hand in hand, not only at\r\nelections but in the Reichstag and in diets and councils, with the\r\nNational Liberals and the Radicals. For the future of sane liberalism\r\nin Germany this trend of the party in the direction of co-operative\r\nand constructive effort augurs well. At the annual congress held at\r\nChemnitz in September, 1912, the issue of revisionism was debated at\r\nlength and with much feeling, but an open breach within the party was\r\naverted and Herr Bebel was again elected party president. It was shown\r\nupon this occasion that the party membership numbered 970,112, a gain\r\nof 133,550 during the previous year. It need hardly be observed that\r\nof the millions of men who in these days vote for Social Democratic\r\ncandidates for office hardly a fourth are identified with the formal\r\nparty organization.[350]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 349: Herr Bebel died August 13, 1913.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 350: Two important works of recent date\r\n                   dealing with the history and character of political\r\n                   parties in Germany are C.

LAW AND JUSTICE                                                (p. 241)\r\n\r\n*256. Dual Character.*--Upon the subject of the administration of\r\njustice the Imperial constitution of 1871 contained but a single\r\nclause, by which there was vested in the Empire power of \"general\r\nlegislation concerning the law of obligations, criminal law,\r\ncommercial law and commercial paper, and judicial procedure.\" By an\r\namendment adopted December 20, 1873, the clause was modified to read,\r\n\"general legislation as to the whole domain of civil and criminal law,\r\nand of judicial procedure.\"[351] Each of the federated states has\r\nalways had, and still has, its own judicial system, and justice is\r\nadministered all but exclusively in courts that belong to the states.\r\nThese courts, however, have been declared to be also courts of the\r\nEmpire, and, to the end that they may be systematized and that\r\nconditions of justice may be made uniform throughout the land, the\r\nfederal government has not hesitated to avail itself of the regulative\r\npowers conferred in 1871 and amplified in 1873 in the constitutional\r\nprovisions which have been cited.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 351: Art. 4. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 328.]\r\n\r\n*257. Diversity of Law Prior to 1871.*--In the first place, there has\r\nbeen brought about within the past generation a unification of German\r\nlaw so thoroughgoing in character as to be worthy of comparison with\r\nthe systematization of the law of France which was accomplished\r\nthrough the agency of the Code Napoléon. In 1871 there were comprised\r\nwithin the Empire more than two score districts each of which\r\npossessed an essentially distinct body of civil and criminal law; and,\r\nto add to the confusion, the boundaries of these districts, though at\r\none time coincident with the limits of the various political divisions\r\nof the country, were no longer so. The case of Prussia was typical. In\r\n1871 the older Prussian provinces were living under a Prussian code\r\npromulgated in 1794; the Rhenish provinces maintained the Code\r\nNapoléon, established by Napoleon in all Germany west of the Rhine; in\r\nthe Pomeranian districts there were large survivals of Swedish law;\r\nwhile the territories acquired after the war of 1866 had each its  (p. 242)\r\nindigenous legal system. Two German states only in 1871 possessed a\r\nfairly uniform body of law. Baden had adopted a German version of the\r\nCode Napoléon, and Saxony, in 1865, had put in operation a code of her\r\nown devising. At no period of German history had there been either\r\neffective law-making or legal codification which was applicable to the\r\nwhole of the territory contained within the Empire. In the domain of\r\nthe civil law, in that of the criminal law, and in that of procedure\r\nthe diversity was alike obvious and annoying.\r\n\r\n*258. Preparation of the Codes.*--German legal reform since 1871 has\r\nconsisted principally in the formation and adoption of successive\r\ncodes, each of which has aimed at essential completeness within a\r\ngiven branch of law. The task had been begun, indeed, before 1871. As\r\nearly as 1861 the states had agreed upon a code relating to trade and\r\nbanking, and this code had been readopted, in 1869, by the\r\nConfederation of 1867.[352] In 1869 a code of criminal law had been\r\nworked out for the Confederation, and in 1870 a code relating to\r\nmanufactures and labor. Upon the establishment of the Empire, in 1871,\r\nthere was created a commission to which was assigned the task of\r\ndrawing up regulations for civil procedure and for criminal procedure,\r\nand also a plan for the reorganization of the courts. Beginning with a\r\nscheme of civil procedure, published in December, 1872, the commission\r\nbrought in an elaborate project upon each of the three subjects. The\r\ncode of civil procedure, by which many important reforms were\r\nintroduced in the interest of publicity and speed, was well received.\r\nThat relating to criminal procedure, proposing as it did to abolish\r\nthroughout the Empire trial by jury, was, however, vigorously opposed,\r\nand the upshot was that all three reports were referred to a new\r\ncommission, by which the original projects relating to criminal\r\nprocedure and to the organization of the courts were completely\r\nremodelled. In the end the revised projects were adopted. October 1,\r\n1879, there went into effect a group of fundamental laws under which\r\nthe administration of justice throughout the Empire has been\r\ncontrolled from that day to the present. The most important of these\r\nwas the Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz, or Law of Judicial Organization,\r\nenacted January 27, 1877; the Civilprozessordnung, or Code of Civil\r\nProcedure, of January 30, 1877; and the Strafprozessordnung, or Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure, of February 1, 1877.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 352: It was replaced by a new code May\r\n                   10, 1897.]\r\n\r\nIt remained only to effect a codification of the civil law. A\r\ncommittee constituted for the purpose completed its work in 1887, and\r\nthe draft submitted by it was placed for revision in the hands of a\r\nnew commission, by which it was reported in 1895. In an amended form\r\nthe Civil Code was approved by the Reichstag, August 18, 1896, and (p. 243)\r\nit was put in operation January 1, 1900. Excluding matters pertaining\r\nto land tenure (which are left to be regulated by the states), the\r\nCode deals not only with all of the usual subjects of civil law but\r\nalso with subjects arising from the contact of private law and public\r\nlaw.[353]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 353: A convenient manual for English\r\n                   readers is E. M. Borchard, Guide to the Law and\r\n                   Legal Literature of Germany (Washington, 1912), the\r\n                   first of a series of guides to European law in\r\n                   preparation in the Library of Congress.]\r\n\r\n*259. The Inferior Courts.*--By these and other measures it has been\r\nbrought about that throughout the Empire justice is administered in\r\ntribunals whose officials are appointed by the local governments and\r\nwhich render decisions in their name, but whose organization, powers,\r\nand rules of procedure are regulated minutely by federal law. The\r\nhierarchy of tribunals provided for in the Law of Judicial\r\nOrganization comprises courts of four grades. At the bottom are the\r\nAmtsgerichte, of which there are approximately two thousand in the\r\nEmpire. These are courts of first instance, consisting ordinarily of\r\nbut a single judge. In civil cases their jurisdiction extends to the\r\nsum of three hundred marks; in criminal, to matters involving a fine\r\nof not more than six hundred marks or imprisonment of not over three\r\nmonths. In criminal cases the judge sits with two Schöffen (sheriffs)\r\nselected by lot from the jury lists. Besides litigious business the\r\nAmtsgerichte have charge of the registration of land titles, the\r\ndrawing up of wills, guardianship, and other local interests.\r\n\r\nNext above the Amtsgerichte are the 173 district courts, or\r\nLandgerichte, each composed of a president and a variable number of\r\nassociate judges. Each Landgericht is divided into a civil and a\r\ncriminal chamber. There may, indeed, be other chambers, as for example\r\na Kammer für Handelssachen, or chamber for commercial cases. The\r\npresident presides over a full bench; a director over each chamber.\r\nThe Landgericht exercises a revisory jurisdiction over judgments of\r\nthe Amtsgerichte, and possesses a more extended original jurisdiction\r\nin both civil and criminal matters. The criminal chamber, consisting\r\nof five judges (of whom four are necessary to convict), is competent,\r\nfor example, to try cases of felony punishable with imprisonment for a\r\nterm not exceeding five years. For the trial of many sorts of criminal\r\ncases there are special Schwurgerichte, or jury courts, which sit\r\nunder the presidency of three judges of the Landgerichte. A jury\r\nconsists of twelve members, of whom eight are necessary to convict.\r\n\r\nStill above the Landgerichte are the Oberlandesgerichte, of which\r\nthere are twenty-eight in the Empire, each consisting of seven judges.\r\nThe Oberlandesgerichte are courts of appellate jurisdiction largely.\r\nEach is divided into a civil and a criminal senate. There is a     (p. 244)\r\npresident of the full court and a similar official for each senate.[354]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 354: In Bavaria alone there is an Oberste\r\n                   Landesgericht, with twenty-one judges. Its relation\r\n                   to the Bavarian Oberlandesgerichte is that of an\r\n                   appellate tribunal.]\r\n\r\n*260. The Reichsgericht.*--At the apex of the system stands the\r\nReichsgericht (created by law of October i, 1879), which, apart from\r\ncertain administrative, military, and consular courts,[355] is the\r\nonly German tribunal of an exclusively Imperial, or federal,\r\ncharacter. It exercises original jurisdiction in cases involving\r\ntreason against the Empire and hears appeals from the consular courts\r\nand from the state courts on questions of Imperial law. Its members,\r\nninety-two in number, are appointed by the Emperor for life, on\r\nnomination of the Bundesrath, and they are organized in six civil and\r\nfour criminal senates. Sittings are held invariably at Leipzig, in the\r\nkingdom of Saxony.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 355: The highest administrative court is\r\n                   the Oberverwaltungsgericht, whose members are\r\n                   appointed for life. Under specified conditions, the\r\n                   \"committees\" of circles, cities, and districts\r\n                   exercise inferior administrative jurisdiction. For\r\n                   the adjustment of disputed or doubtful\r\n                   jurisdictions there stands between the ordinary and\r\n                   the administrative tribunals a Gerichtshof für\r\n                   Kompetenz-konflikte, or Court of Conflicts,\r\n                   consisting of eleven judges appointed for life.]\r\n\r\nAll judges in the courts of the states are appointed by the sovereigns\r\nof the respective states. The Imperial law prescribes a minimum of\r\nqualifications based on professional study and experience, the state\r\nbeing left free to impose any additional qualifications that may be\r\ndesired. All judges are appointed for life and all receive a salary\r\nwhich may not be reduced; and there are important guarantees against\r\narbitrary transfer from one position to another, as well as other\r\npractices that might operate to diminish the judge's impartiality and\r\nindependence.[356]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 356: On the German judiciary see Howard,\r\n                   The German Empire, Chap. 9; Laband, Das Staatsrecht\r\n                   des deutschen Reiches, §§ 83-94; C.

THE GERMAN STATES AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n*261. Variations of Type.*--Within the bounds of Germany to-day there\r\nare twenty-five states and one Imperial territory with certain\r\nattributes of statehood, Alsace-Lorraine. During the larger portion of\r\nthe nineteenth century each of these states (and of the several which\r\nno longer exist) was possessed of substantial sovereignty, and each\r\nmaintained its own arrangements, respecting governmental forms and\r\nprocedure. Under the leadership of Prussia, as has been pointed out,\r\nthe loose Confederation of 1815 was transformed, during the years\r\n1866-1871, into an Imperial union, federal but yet vigorous and\r\nindestructible, and to the constituted authorities of this Empire was\r\nintrusted an enormous aggregate of governmental powers. The powers\r\nconferred were, however, not wholly abstracted from the original\r\nprerogatives of the individual states. In a very appreciable measure\r\nthey were powers, rather, of a supplementary character, by virtue of\r\nwhich the newly created central government was enabled to do, on a\r\nbroadly national scale, what, in the lack of any such central\r\ngovernment, there would have been neither means of doing, nor occasion\r\nfor doing, at all. Only at certain points, as, for example, in respect\r\nto the levying of customs duties and of taxes, was the original\r\nindependence of the individual state seriously impaired by the terms\r\nof the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that, speaking broadly, each of the German states\r\nmaintains to this day a government which is essentially complete within\r\nitself. No one of these governments covers quite all of the ground which\r\nfalls within the range of jurisdiction of a sovereign state; each is\r\ncut into at various points by the superior authority of the Empire;\r\nbut each is sufficiently ample to be capable of continuing to run,\r\nwere all of the other governments of Germany instantly to be blotted\r\nout.[357] Of the twenty-five state governments, three--those of the\r\nfree cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck--are aristocratic       (p. 246)\r\nrepublics; all the others are monarchies. Among the monarchies there\r\nare four kingdoms: Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemberg; six\r\ngrand-duchies: Baden, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz,\r\nOldenburg, and Saxe-Weimar; five duchies: Anhalt, Brunswick,\r\nSaxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Saxe-Meiningen; and seven\r\nprincipalities: Lippe, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sonderhausen,\r\nSchaumburg-Lippe, Reuss Älterer Linie, Reuss Jüngerer Linie, and\r\nWaldeck-Pyrmont.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 357: The best survey in English of the\r\n                   governments of the German states is that in Lowell,\r\n                   Governments and Parties, I., Chap. 6.

The\r\n                   most elaborate treatment of the subject is to be\r\n                   found in an excellent series of studies edited by\r\n                   H. von Marquardsen and M. von Seydel under the\r\n                   title Handbuch des Oeffentlichen Rechts der\r\n                   Gegenwart in Monographien (Freiburg and Tübingen,\r\n                   1883-1909). A new series of monographs, comprising\r\n                   substantially a revision of this collection, is at\r\n                   present in course of publication by J. C. B. Mohr\r\n                   at Tübingen. The texts of the various constitutions\r\n                   are printed in F. Stoerk, Handbuch der deutschen\r\n                   Verfassungen (Leipzig, 1884).]\r\n\r\n*262. The Preponderance of Prussia.*--From whatever angle one approaches\r\nGerman public affairs, the fact that stands out with greatest\r\ndistinctness is the preponderant position occupied by the kingdom of\r\nPrussia. How it was that Prussia became the virtual creator of the\r\nEmpire, and how it is that Prussia so dominates the Imperial\r\ngovernment that that government and the Prussian are at times all but\r\ninextricable, has already been pointed out.[358] Wholly apart from the\r\nsheer physical fact that 134,616 square miles of Germany's 208,780,\r\nand 40,163,333 people of the Empire's 64,903,423, are Prussian, the\r\nvery conditions under which the Imperial organization of the present\r\nday came into being predetermined that Prussia and things Prussian\r\nshould enjoy unfailing pre-eminence in all that pertains to German\r\ngovernment and politics. Both because they are extended immediately\r\nover a country almost two-thirds as large as France, and because of\r\ntheir peculiar relation to the political system of the Empire, the\r\ninstitutions of Prussia call for somewhat detailed consideration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 358: See pp. 200-201, 207.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RISE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN PRUSSIA\r\n\r\n*263. Regeneration in the Napoleonic Period.*--By reason of the\r\nvacillating policies of her sovereign, Frederick William III., the\r\nsuccessive defeats of her armies at Jena, Auerstädt, and elsewhere,\r\nand the loss, by the treaty of Tilsit in 1807, of half of her\r\nterritory, Prussia realized from the first decade of the Napoleonic\r\nperiod little save humiliation and disaster. Through the years\r\n1807-1815, however, her lot was wonderfully improved. Upon the failure\r\nof the Russian expedition of Napoleon in 1812, Frederick William   (p. 247)\r\nshook off his apprehensions and allied himself openly with the\r\nsovereigns of Russia and Austria. The people rose _en masse_, and in\r\nthe titanic struggle which ensued Prussia played a part scarcely\r\nsecond in importance to that of any other power. At the end she was\r\nrewarded, through the agency of the Congress of Vienna, by being\r\nassigned the northern portion of Saxony, Swedish Pomerania, her old\r\npossessions west of the Elbe, the duchies of Berg and Julich, and a\r\nnumber of other districts in Westphalia and on the Rhine. Her area in\r\n1815 was 108,000 square miles, as compared with 122,000 at the\r\nbeginning of 1806; but her loss of territory was more than compensated\r\nby the substitution that had been made of German lands for\r\nSlavic.[359] The homogeneity of her population was thereby increased,\r\nher essentially Germanic character emphasized, and her capacity for\r\nGerman leadership enhanced.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 359: L. A. Himly, Histoire de la\r\n                   formation territoriale des états de l'Europe\r\n                   centrale, 2 vols. (Paris, 1876), I., 93-110.]\r\n\r\nIt was not merely in respect to territory and population that the\r\nPrussia of 1815 was different from the Prussia of a decade earlier.\r\nConsequent upon the humiliating disasters of 1806 there set in a moral\r\nregeneration by which there was wrought one of the speediest and one\r\nof the most thoroughgoing national transformations recorded in\r\nhistory. In 1807 Frederick William's statesmanlike minister Stein\r\naccomplished the abolition of serfdom and of all legal distinctions\r\nwhich separated the various classes of society.[360] In 1808 he\r\nreformed the municipalities and gave them important powers of\r\nself-government. By a series of sweeping measures he reconstructed the\r\nministerial departments, the governments of the provinces, and the\r\nlocal administrative machinery, with the result of creating an\r\nexecutive system which has required but little modification to the\r\npresent day. In numerous directions, especially in relation to\r\neconomic conditions, the work of Stein was continued by that of the\r\nsucceeding minister, Prince Hardenberg. By Scharnhorst and Gneisenau\r\nthe military régime was overhauled and a body of spiritless soldiery\r\nkept in order by fear was converted into \"a union of all the moral and\r\nphysical energies of the nation.\" By Wilhelm von Humboldt the modern\r\nPrussian school system was created; while by Fichte, Arndt, and a\r\ngalaxy of other writers there was imparted a stimulus by which the\r\npatriotism and aspiration of the Prussian people were raised to    (p. 248)\r\nan unprecedented pitch.[361]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 360: It is to be observed that while\r\n                   Stein was officially the author of this reform, the\r\n                   substance of the changes introduced had been agreed\r\n                   upon by the king and his advisers before Stein's\r\n                   accession to office (October 4, 1807). The Edict of\r\n                   Emancipation was promulgated October 9, 1807. It\r\n                   made the abolition of serfdom final and absolute on\r\n                   and after October 8, 1810.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 361: E.

Obstacles to the Establishment of a Constitution.*--Such an epoch\r\nof regeneration could not fail to be a favorable period for the growth\r\nof liberal principles of government. In June, 1814, and again in May,\r\n1815, King Frederick William promised, through the medium of a cabinet\r\norder, to give consideration to the question of the establishment of a\r\nconstitution in which provision should be made not merely for the\r\nestates of the provinces but also for a national diet. After the\r\nCongress of Vienna the task of framing such a constitution was\r\nactually taken in hand. But the time was not ripe. Liberalism had\r\ngained headway as yet among only the professional classes, while the\r\nhighly influential body of ultra-conservative landholders were\r\nunalterably opposed. Between the eastern provinces, still essentially\r\nfeudal in spirit, and the western ones, visibly affected by French\r\nrevolutionary ideas, there was, furthermore, meager community of\r\ninterest. So keen was the particularistic spirit that not infrequently\r\nthe various provinces of the kingdom were referred to in contemporary\r\ndocuments as \"nations.\" Among these provinces some retained the system\r\nof estates which had prevailed throughout Germany since the Middle\r\nAges, but in some of those which had fallen under the control of\r\nNapoleon the estates had been abolished, and in others they were in\r\nabeyance. In a few they had never existed. Votes were taken in the\r\nassemblages of the estates by orders, not by individuals, and the\r\nfunction of the bodies rarely extended beyond the approving of\r\nprojects of taxation. Within the provinces there existed no\r\nsub-structure of popular institutions capable of being made the basis\r\nof a national parliamentary system.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these deterring circumstances, it is not improbable\r\nthat some sort of constitution might have been established but for the\r\nexcesses of the more zealous Liberals, culminating in the murder of\r\nthe dramatist Kotzebue in 1819, whereby the king was thrown into an\r\nattitude, first of apprehension, and finally of uncompromising\r\nreaction. By assuming joint responsibility for the Carlsbad Decrees of\r\nOctober 17, 1819, he surrendered completely to the régime of\r\n\"stability\" which all the while had been urged upon him by Metternich.\r\nJune 11, 1821, he summoned a commission to organize a system of\r\nprovincial estates;[362] but at the same time the project of a national\r\nconstitution and a national diet was definitely abandoned. Under   (p. 249)\r\nrepression Prussian liberalism languished, and throughout the\r\nremainder of the reign, i.e., to 1840, the issue of constitutionalism\r\nwas not frequently raised. In Prussia, as in Austria, the widespread\r\nrevolutionary demonstrations of 1830 elicited little response.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 362: The system was created by royal\r\n                   patent June 5, 1823.]\r\n\r\n*265. The Diet of 1847.*--Upon the accession of Frederick William IV.,\r\nson of Frederick William III., in 1840, the hopes of the Liberals were\r\nrevived. The new sovereign was believed to be a man of advanced ideas.\r\nTo a degree he was such, as was manifested by his speedy reversal of\r\nhis father's narrow ecclesiastical policy, and by other enlightened\r\nacts. But time demonstrated that his liberalism was not without\r\ncertain very definite limits. February 13, 1847, he went so far as to\r\nsummon a Vereinigter Landtag, or \"united diet,\" of Prussia, comprising\r\nall members of the existing eight provincial assemblies, and organized\r\nin two chambers--a house of lords and a house containing the three\r\nestates of the knights, burghers, and peasants. But the issue was\r\nunhappy. As Metternich had predicted, the meeting of the Diet but\r\nafforded opportunity for a forceful reassertion of constitutional\r\naspirations, and the assemblage refused to sanction loans upon which\r\nthe sovereign was bent until its representative character should have\r\nbeen more completely recognized. The king, on his part, declared he\r\nwould never allow \"to come between Almighty God in heaven and this\r\nland a blotted parchment, to rule us with paragraphs, and to replace\r\nthe ancient, sacred bond of loyalty.\" The deadlock was absolute, and,\r\nJune 26, the Diet was dissolved.\r\n\r\n*266. The Revolution of 1848.*--The dawn of constitutionalism was,\r\nhowever, near. The fundamental law under which Prussia still is\r\ngoverned was a product--one of the few which endured--of the\r\nwidespread revolutionary movement of 1848. Upon the arrival in Berlin\r\nof the news of the overthrow of Louis Philippe (February 24) at Paris\r\nand of the fall of Metternich (May 13) at Vienna, the Prussian\r\nLiberals renewed with vigor their clamor for the establishment in\r\nPrussia of a government of a constitutional type. The demand was\r\nclosely related to, yet was essentially distinct from, the\r\ncontemporary project for the inauguration of a new constitutional\r\nGerman Empire. As was proved by the vagaries of the Frankfort\r\nParliament (May, 1848, to June, 1849), conditions were not yet ripe\r\nfor the creation of a closely-knit empire;[363] and one of the reasons\r\nwhy this was true was that a necessary step toward that culmination\r\nwas only now about to be taken, i.e., the introduction of constitutional\r\ngovernment in the important kingdom of Prussia. Apprehensive lest  (p. 250)\r\nthe scenes of violence reported from Paris should be re-enacted in his\r\nown capital, Frederick William acquiesced in the demands of his\r\nsubjects in so far as to issue letters patent, May 13, 1848, convoking\r\na national assembly[364] for the consideration of a proposed\r\nconstitution. Every male citizen over twenty-five years of age was\r\ngiven the right to participate in the choice of electors, by whom in\r\nturn were chosen the members of this assembly. May 22, 1848, the\r\nassembly met in Berlin and entered upon consideration of the sketch of\r\na fundamental law which the king laid before it. The meeting was\r\nattended by disorders in the city, and the more radical deputies\r\nfurther inflamed public feeling by persisting in the discussion of the\r\nabolition of the nobility, and of a variety of other more or less\r\nimpracticable and revolutionary projects. The king took offense\r\nbecause the assembly presumed to exercise constituent functions\r\nindependently and, after compelling a removal of the sittings to the\r\nneighboring city of Brandenburg, he in disgust dissolved the body,\r\nDecember 5, and promulgated of his own right the constitutional\r\ncharter which he had drawn.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 363: See p. 198.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 364: Known technically as Versammlung zur\r\n                   Vereinbarung der preussischen Verfassung.]\r\n\r\n*267. Formation of the Constitution.*--At an earlier date it had been\r\npromised that the constitution to be established should be \"agreed\r\nupon with an assembly of the nation's representatives freely chosen\r\nand invested with full powers;\" but it had been suggested to the king\r\nthat the way out of the existing difficulty lay in issuing a\r\nconstitutional instrument independently and subsequently allowing the\r\nLandtag first elected under it to submit it to a legislative revision,\r\nand this was the course of procedure which was adopted.[365] Elections\r\nwere held and, February 26, 1849, the chambers were assembled. Having\r\nrecognized formally the instrument of December 5, 1848, as the law of\r\nthe land, the two bodies addressed themselves forthwith to the task of\r\nrevising it. The result was disagreement and, in the end, the\r\ndissolution of the lower house. The constitution of 1848 had been\r\naccompanied by an electoral law establishing voting by secret ballot\r\nand conferring upon all male citizens equal suffrage. Upon the\r\ndissolution of 1849 there was promulgated by the king a thoroughgoing\r\nmodification of this democratic measure, whereby voting by ballot was\r\nabolished and parliamentary electors were divided into three classes\r\nwhose voting power was determined by property qualifications or by (p. 251)\r\nofficial and professional status. In other words, there was introduced\r\nthat peculiar three-class system which was already not unknown in the\r\nPrussian municipalities, and which, in both national and city\r\nelections, persists throughout the kingdom to the present day. In the\r\nelections which were held in the summer of 1849 in accordance with\r\nthis system the democrats refused to participate. The upshot was that\r\nthe new chambers, convened August 7, 1849, proved tractable enough,\r\nand by them the text of the constitution, after being discussed and\r\nrevised article by article, was at last accorded formal approval. On\r\nthe last day of January, 1850, the instrument was duly promulgated at\r\nCharlottenburg.[366] By Austria, Russia, and other reactionary powers\r\npersistent effort was made during the ensuing decade to influence the\r\nking to rescind the concession which he had made. He refused, however,\r\nto do so, and, with certain modifications, the constitution of 1850\r\nremains the fundamental law of the Prussian kingdom to-day.[367]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 365: The confusion of constitutional and\r\n                   ordinary statutory law inherent in this arrangement\r\n                   has influenced profoundly the thought of German\r\n                   jurists.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 366: On the establishment of\r\n                   constitutionalism in Prussia see (in addition to\r\n                   works mentioned on p. 201) P.

Nature of the Constitution.*--The constitution of Prussia is\r\nmodelled upon that of Belgium. Provisions relating to the powers of\r\nthe crown, the competence of the chambers, and the functions of the\r\nministers are reproduced almost literally from the older instrument.\r\nNone the less, the two rest upon widely differing bases. The Belgian\r\nfundamental law begins with the assertion that \"all powers emanate\r\nfrom the nation.\" That of Prussia voices no such sentiment, and the\r\ngovernmental system for which it provides has as its cornerstone the\r\nthoroughgoing supremacy of the crown.[368] The Liberals of the\r\nmid-century period were by no means satisfied with it; and, sixty\r\nyears after, it stands out among the great constitutional documents of\r\nthe European world so conspicuous by reason of its disregard of\r\nfundamental democratic principle as to justify completely the      (p. 252)\r\ncharges of anachronism which reformers in Prussia and elsewhere are\r\nin these days bringing against it. It provides for the responsibility\r\nof ministers, without stipulating a means whereby that responsibility\r\nmay be enforced. There is maintained under it one of the most\r\nantiquated and undemocratic electoral systems in Europe. And, as is\r\npointed out by Lowell, even where, on paper, it appears to be liberal,\r\nit is sometimes much less so than its text would lead one to suppose.\r\nIt contains, for example, a bill of rights, which alone comprises no\r\nfewer than forty of the one hundred eleven permanent articles of the\r\ninstrument.[369] In it are guaranteed the personal liberty of the\r\nsubject, the security of property, the inviolability of personal\r\ncorrespondence, immunity from domiciliary visitation, freedom of the\r\npress, toleration of religious sects, liberty of migration, and the\r\nright of association and public meeting. But there is an almost total\r\nlack of machinery by which effect can be given to some of the most\r\nimportant provisions relating to these subjects. Some guarantees of\r\nwhat would seem the most fundamental rights, as those of public\r\nassemblage and of liberty of teaching, are reduced in practice to\r\nempty phrases.[370]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 368: Dupriez, Les Ministres, I., 350.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 369: Arts. 3-42. Robinson, Constitution\r\n                   of the Kingdom of Prussia, 27-34.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 370: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   286.]\r\n\r\nThe process of constitutional amendment in Prussia is easy. With the\r\napproval of the king, an amendment may at any time be adopted by a\r\nsimple majority of the two legislative chambers, with the special\r\nrequirement only that an amendment, unlike a statute, must be voted\r\nupon twice, with an interval of three weeks between the two votes.\r\nDuring the first ten years of its existence the constitution was\r\namended no fewer than ten times. Of later amendments there have been\r\nsix, but none more recent than that of May 27, 1888. The Prussian\r\nsystem of amendment by simple legislative process was incorporated, in\r\n1867, in the fundamental law of the North German Confederation (except\r\nthat in the Bundesrath a two-thirds vote was required); and in 1871 it\r\nwas perpetuated in the constitution of the Empire.[371]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 371: There is an annotated English\r\n                   version of the Prussian constitution, edited by J.\r\n                   H.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY                                    (p. 253)\r\n\r\n*269. Status of the Crown.*--At the head of the state stands the king,\r\nin whom is vested the executive, and a considerable share in the\r\nlegislative, power. The crown is hereditary in the male line of the\r\nhouse of Hohenzollern, following the principle of primogeniture. An\r\nheir to the throne is regarded as attaining his majority on the\r\ncompletion of his eighteenth year. It has been pointed out that the\r\nGerman Emperor, as such, has no civil list. He has no need of one, for\r\nthe reason that in the capacity of king of Prussia he is entitled to\r\none of the largest civil lists known to European governments. Since\r\nthe increase provided for by law of February 20, 1889, the\r\n\"Krondotations Rente,\" as it appears in the annual Prussian budget,\r\naggregates 15,719,296 marks; besides which the king enjoys the\r\nrevenues from a vast amount of private property, comprising castles,\r\nforests, and estates in various parts of the realm. There are also\r\ncertain special funds the income from which is available for the needs\r\nof the royal family.\r\n\r\n*270. Powers.*--The powers of the crown are very comprehensive.[372] It\r\nis perhaps not too much to say that they exceed those exercised by any\r\nother European sovereign. The king is head of the army and of the\r\nchurch, and in him are vested, directly or indirectly, all functions\r\nof an executive and administrative character. All appointments to\r\noffices of state are made by him immediately or under his authority.\r\nThe upper legislative chamber is recruited almost exclusively by royal\r\nnomination. And all measures, before they become law, require the\r\nking's assent; though, by reason of the sovereign's absolute control\r\nof the upper chamber, no measure of which he disapproves can ever be\r\nenacted by that body, so that there is never an occasion for the\r\nexercise of the formal veto. To employ the language of a celebrated\r\nGerman jurist, the king possesses \"the whole and undivided power of\r\nthe state in all its plenitude. It would, therefore, be contrary to\r\nthe nature of the monarchical constitutional law of Germany to\r\nenumerate all individual powers of the king.... His sovereign right\r\nembraces, on the contrary, all branches of the government. Everything\r\nwhich is decided or carried out in the state takes place in the name\r\nof the king. He is the personified power of the state.\"[373]       (p. 254)\r\nExcept in so far as the competence of the sovereign is expressly\r\nlimited or regulated by the constitution, it is to be regarded as\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 372: They are enumerated in articles\r\n                   45-52 of the constitution. Robinson, Constitution\r\n                   of the Kingdom of Prussia, 36-37.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 373: Schulze, Preussisches Staatsrecht,\r\n                   I., 158.]\r\n\r\n*271. The Ministry: Composition and Status.*--The organization of the\r\nexecutive--the creation of ministerial portfolios, the appointment of\r\nministers, and the delimitation of departmental functions--rests\r\nabsolutely with the king, save, of course, for the necessity of\r\nprocuring from the Landtag the requisite appropriations. Beginning in\r\nthe days of Stein with five, the number of ministries was gradually\r\nincreased until since 1878 there have been nine, as follows: Foreign\r\nAffairs;[374] the Interior; Ecclesiastical, Educational, and Sanitary\r\nAffairs; Commerce and Industry; Finance; War; Justice; Public Works;\r\nand Agriculture, Public Domains, and Forests. Each ministry rests upon\r\nan essentially independent basis and there has been little attempt to\r\nreduce the group to the uniformity or symmetry of organization that\r\ncharacterizes the ministries of France, Italy, and other continental\r\nmonarchies. Departmental heads, as well as subordinates, are appointed\r\nwith reference solely to their administrative efficiency, not, as in\r\nparliamentary governments, in consideration of their politics or of\r\ntheir status in the existing political situation. They need not be,\r\nand usually are not, members of either of the legislative chambers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 374: The Minister of Foreign Affairs is\r\n                   at the same time the Minister-President of Prussia\r\n                   and the Chancellor of the Empire. On the functions\r\n                   of the various ministries see Dupriez, Les\r\n                   Ministres, I., 448-462.]\r\n\r\nFor it is essential to observe that in Prussia ministers are\r\nresponsible only to the sovereign, which means that the parliamentary\r\nsystem, in the proper sense, does not exist. The constitution, it is\r\ntrue, prescribes that every act of the king shall be countersigned by\r\na minister, who thereby assumes responsibility for it.[375] But there\r\nis no machinery whereby this nominal responsibility can be made, in\r\npractice, to mean anything. Ministers do not retire by reason of an\r\nadverse vote in the Landtag; and, although upon vote of either\r\nlegislative chamber, they may be prosecuted for treason, bribery, or\r\nviolation of the constitution, no penalties are prescribed in the\r\nevent of conviction, so that the provision is of no practical\r\neffect.[376] Every minister possesses the right to appear on the   (p. 255)\r\nfloor of either chamber, and to be heard at any time when no member of\r\nthe house is actually speaking. In the exercise of this privilege the\r\nminister is the immediate spokesman of the crown, a fact which is apt\r\nto be apparent from the tenor of his utterances.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 375: Art. 44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 376: Art. 61. Robinson, Constitution of\r\n                   the Kingdom of Prussia, 40. In the words of a\r\n                   German jurist, \"the anomaly continues to exist in\r\n                   Prussia of ministerial responsibility solemnly\r\n                   enunciated in the constitution, the character of\r\n                   the responsibility, the accuser and the court\r\n                   specified, and at the same time a complete lack of\r\n                   any legal means by which the representatives of the\r\n                   people can protect even the constitution itself\r\n                   against the most flagrant violations and the most\r\n                   dangerous attacks.\" Schulze, Preussisches\r\n                   Staatsrecht, II., 694.]\r\n\r\n*272. The Ministry: Organization and Workings.*--The Prussian ministry\r\nexhibits little solidarity. There is a \"president of the council of\r\nministers,\" who is invariably the Minister for Foreign Affairs and at\r\nthe same time the Chancellor of the Empire, but his functions are by\r\nno means those of the corresponding dignitary in France and Italy.\r\nOver his colleagues he possesses, as president, no substantial\r\nauthority whatsoever.[377] In the lack of responsibility to the\r\nLandtag, there is no occasion for an attempt to hold the ministry\r\nsolidly together in the support of a single, consistent programme. The\r\nministers are severally controlled by, and responsible to, the crown,\r\nand the views or policies of one need not at all be those of another.\r\nAt the same time, of course, in the interest of efficiency it is\r\ndesirable that there shall be a certain amount of unity and of\r\nconcerted action. To attain this there was established by Count\r\nHardenberg a Staats-Ministerium, or Ministry of State, which occupies\r\nin the Prussian executive system a position somewhat similar to that\r\noccupied in the French by the Council of Ministers.[378] The Ministry\r\nof State is composed of the nine ministerial heads, together with the\r\nImperial secretaries of state for the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and\r\nthe Navy. It holds meetings at least as frequently as once a week for\r\nthe discussion of matters of common administrative interest, the\r\ndrafting of laws or of constitutional amendments, the supervision of\r\nlocal administration, and, in emergencies, the promulgation of\r\nordinances which have the force of law until the ensuing session of\r\nthe Landtag. There are certain acts, as the proclaiming of a state of\r\nsiege, which may be performed only with the sanction of this body. The\r\nfact remains, none the less, that, normally, the work of the several\r\ndepartments is carried on independently and that the ministry exhibits\r\nless cohesion than any other in a state of Prussia's size and\r\nimportance. It is to be observed that there is likewise a Staatsrath,\r\nor Council of State (dating originally from 1604 and revived in    (p. 256)\r\n1817), composed of princes, high officials of state, ministers,\r\njudges, and other persons of influence designated by the crown. It may\r\nbe consulted on legislative proposals, disputes as to the spheres of\r\nthe various ministries, and other important matters. In barrenness of\r\nfunction, however, as in structure, it bears a close resemblance\r\nto-day to the British Privy Council.[379]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 377: The office of Chancellor was\r\n                   discontinued with the death of Hardenberg and that\r\n                   of Minister-President substituted. The Chancellor\r\n                   possessed substantial authority over his\r\n                   colleagues. Since 1871, the Minister-President has\r\n                   been a Chancellor, but of the Empire, not of\r\n                   Prussia.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 378: The Staats-Ministerium was called\r\n                   into being, to replace the old Council of State, by\r\n                   an ordinance of October 27, 1810. Its functions\r\n                   were further elaborated in cabinet orders of June\r\n                   3, 1814, and November 3, 1817.

Subsidiary Executive Bodies.*--Two other executive organs possess\r\nconsiderable importance. These are the Oberrechnungskammer, or Supreme\r\nChamber of Accounts, and the Volkswirthschaftsrath, or Economic\r\nCouncil. The Oberrechnungskammer has existed continuously since 1714.\r\nIts function is the oversight and revision of the finances of the\r\ndepartments, the administration of the state debt, and the acquisition\r\nand disposal of state property. Its president is appointed by the\r\ncrown, on nomination of the Staats-Ministerium. Its remaining members\r\nare designated by the crown on nomination of its own president,\r\ncountersigned by the president of the Staats-Ministerium. All enjoy\r\nthe tenure and the immunities of judges, and the body collectively is\r\nresponsible, not to the Ministry of State, but to the crown\r\nimmediately. In status and function it resembles somewhat closely the\r\nFrench Cour des Comptes. The same group of men, with additional\r\nmembers appointed by the Bundesrath, serves as the Chamber of Accounts\r\nof the Empire. The Volkswirthschaftsrath consists of seventy-five\r\nmembers named by the king for a term of five years. Its business is to\r\ngive preliminary consideration to measures vitally affecting large\r\neconomic interests, to determine what should be Prussia's position in\r\nthe Bundesrath upon these measures, and to recommend to the crown\r\ndefinite courses of action regarding them. Its function is purely\r\nconsultative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII                                                       (p. 257)\r\n\r\nTHE PRUSSIAN LANDTAG--LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI. COMPOSITION OF THE LANDTAG\r\n\r\n*274. The House of Lords: Law of 1853.*--Legislative authority in the\r\nkingdom of Prussia is shared by the king with a national assembly, the\r\nLandtag, composed of two chambers, of which the upper is known as the\r\nHerrenhaus, or House of Lords, and the lower as the Abgeordnetenhaus,\r\nor House of Representatives. Under the original provisions of the\r\nconstitution, the House of Lords was composed of (1) adult princes of\r\nthe royal family; (2) heads of Prussian houses deriving directly from\r\nthe earlier Empire; (3) heads of families designated by royal\r\nordinance, with regard to rights of primogeniture and lineal descent;\r\n(4) 90 members chosen by the principal taxpayers of the kingdom; and\r\n(5) 30 members elected by the municipal councils of the larger towns.\r\nBy law of May 7, 1853, this arrangement was set aside and in its stead\r\nit was enacted that the chamber should be made up entirely of persons\r\nappointed by the crown in heredity or for life; and, on the\r\nauthorization of this measure, there was promulgated, October 12,\r\n1854, a royal ordinance by which the composition of the body was fixed\r\nsubstantially as it is to-day. The act of 1853 forbids that the system\r\nthus brought into operation be further modified, save with the assent\r\nof the Landtag; but this does not alter the fact that the present\r\ncomposition of the Prussian upper house is determined, not by the\r\nconstitution of the kingdom, but by royal ordinance authorized by\r\nlegislative enactment.\r\n\r\n*275. The House of Lords To-day.*--The component elements of the House\r\nof Lords to-day are: (1) princes of the royal family who are of age;\r\n(2) scions of the Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,\r\nand sixteen other once sovereign families of Prussia; (3) heads of the\r\nterritorial nobility created by the king, and numbering some fifty\r\nmembers; (4) a number of life peers, chosen by the king from among\r\nwealthy landowners, great manufacturers, and men of renown; (5) eight\r\ntitled noblemen appointed by the king on the nomination of the\r\nresident landowners of the eight older provinces of the kingdom; (6)\r\nrepresentatives of the universities, of religious bodies, and of towns\r\nof over 50,000 inhabitants, presented by these various organizations\r\nrespectively, but appointed ultimately by the king; and (7) an     (p. 258)\r\nindefinite number of members, chosen by the king for life on any\r\nground whatsoever, and under no restriction except that peers must\r\nhave attained the age of thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the chamber is thus extremely complex. There are\r\nmembers _ex-officio_, members by royal appointment, members by\r\nhereditary right. But the appointing power of the crown is so\r\ncomprehensive that the body partakes largely of the character of a\r\nroyal creation. Its membership is recruited almost exclusively from\r\nthe rigidly conservative landowning aristocracy, so that in attitude\r\nand policy it is apt to be in no degree representative of the mass of\r\nthe nation, at least of the industrial classes. As a rule, though not\r\ninvariably, it is ready to support cordially the measures of the\r\ncrown. In any event, through exercise of the unrestricted power of\r\ncreating peers, the crown is in a position at all times to control its\r\nacts. The number of members varies, but is ordinarily about 300.[380]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 380: Lebon, Études sur l'Allemagne\r\n                   politique, 187-197.]\r\n\r\n*276. The House of Representatives.*--The Abgeordnetenhaus, or House of\r\nRepresentatives, consists of 443 members--362 for the old kingdom, 80\r\nadded in 1867 to represent the newly acquired provinces, and one added\r\nin 1876 to represent Lauenburg. Representatives are elected for a\r\nfive-year term, and every Prussian is eligible who has completed his\r\nthirtieth year, who has paid taxes to the state during as much as\r\nthree years, and whose civil rights have not been impaired by judicial\r\nsentence. Every Prussian who has attained his twenty-fifth year, and\r\nwho is qualified to vote in the municipal elections of his place of\r\ndomicile, is entitled to participate in the choice of a deputy. At\r\nfirst glance the Prussian franchise appears distinctly liberal. It is\r\nso, however, only in the sense that comparatively few adult males are\r\nexcluded from the exercise of it. In its actual workings it is one of\r\nthe most undemocratic in Europe.\r\n\r\n*277. The Electoral System.*--Representatives are chosen in electoral\r\ndistricts, each of which returns from one to three members--as a rule,\r\ntwo. There has been no general redistribution of seats since 1860\r\n(although some changes were made in 1906), so that in many districts,\r\nespecially in the urban centers whose growth has fallen largely within\r\nthe past fifty years, the quota of representatives is grossly\r\ndisproportioned to population. Until 1906 the entire city of Berlin\r\nreturned but nine members, and its quota now is only twelve.[381] The\r\nenfranchised inhabitants of the district do not, moreover, vote    (p. 259)\r\nfor a representative directly. The essential characteristics of the\r\nPrussian electoral system are, first, that the suffrage is indirect,\r\nand, second, that it is unequal. The precise method by which a\r\nrepresentative is elected[382] may be indicated as follows: (1) each\r\ncircle, or district, is divided into a number of Urwahlbezirke, or\r\nsub-districts; (2) in each Urwahlbezirk one Wahlman, or elector, is\r\nallotted to every 250 inhabitants; (3) for the choosing of these\r\nWahlmänner the voters of the sub-district are divided into three\r\nclasses, arranged in such a fashion that the first class will be\r\ncomposed of the payers of direct taxes, beginning with the largest\r\ncontributors, who collectively pay one-third of the tax-quota of the\r\nsub-district, the second class will include the payers next in\r\nimportance who as a group pay the second third, and the last class\r\nwill comprise the remainder; (4) each of these classes chooses, by\r\nabsolute majority, one-third of the electors to which the Urwahlbezirk\r\nis entitled; finally (5) all the electors thus chosen in the various\r\nUrwahlbezirke of the district come together as an electoral college\r\nand choose, by absolute majority, a representative to sit in the\r\nAbgeordnetenhaus at Berlin.[383]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 381: Prior to 1906 the Berlin\r\n                   representatives were chosen in four electoral\r\n                   districts, but in the year mentioned the city was\r\n                   divided into twelve single-member constituencies.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 382: As stipulated in articles 69-75 of\r\n                   the constitution. Robinson, The Constitution of the\r\n                   Kingdom of Prussia, 42-44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 383: In the event that, between\r\n                   elections, a seat falls vacant, a new member is\r\n                   chosen forthwith by this same body of Wahlmänner\r\n                   without a fresh appeal to the original electorate\r\n                   of the district.]\r\n\r\n*278. Origins and Operation of the System.*--The principal features of\r\nthis unique system were devised as a compromise between a\r\nthoroughgoing democracy based on universal suffrage and a government\r\nexclusively by the landholding aristocracy. The three-class\r\narrangement originated in the Rhine Province where, by the local\r\ngovernment code of 1845, it was put in operation in the elections of\r\nthe municipalities. In the constitution of 1850 it was adopted for use\r\nin the national elections, and in subsequent years it was extended to\r\nmunicipal elections in virtually all parts of the kingdom, so that it\r\ncame to be a characteristic and well-nigh universal Prussian\r\ninstitution. It need hardly be pointed out that the scheme throws the\r\nbulk of political power, whether in municipality or in nation, into\r\nthe hands of the men of wealth. In not fewer than 2,214 Urwahlbezirke\r\na third of the direct taxes is paid by a single individual, who\r\ntherefore comprises alone the first electoral class; and in 1703\r\nprecincts the first class consists of but two persons. In most cases\r\nthe number of the least considerable taxpayers who in the aggregate\r\npay the last third of the tax-quota is relatively large. Taking the\r\nkingdom as a whole, it was estimated in 1907 that approximately    (p. 260)\r\nthree per cent of the electorate belonged to the first class, about\r\n9.5 per cent to the second, and the remaining 87.5 to the third. In\r\nthe individual precinct, as in the nation at large, the little group\r\nat the top, however, possesses precisely as much political weight as\r\nthe large group at the bottom, because it is entitled to choose an\r\nequal number of Wahlmänner. The result is a segregation of classes\r\nwhich, whatever its merits at certain points, is of very questionable\r\nutility as a basis of government.\r\n\r\nThe effect politically is to give an enormous advantage to the\r\nconservative and agrarian interests and to deprive the socialists and\r\nother popular elements all but completely of representation. At the\r\nelections of 1903 the Social Democrats put forth effort for the first\r\ntime in an organized way to win seats in the Landtag. Under the system\r\nwhich has been described a total of 324,157 Conservative votes\r\nsufficed to elect 143 representatives, but 314,149 Social Democratic\r\nvotes did not secure the return of a single member. In the Imperial\r\nelections of the same year, conducted under a scheme of equal\r\nsuffrage, the popular party sent to the Reichstag eighty members. At\r\nthe Prussian elections of 1908 a Social Democratic vote which\r\ncomprised approximately twenty-four per cent of the total popular vote\r\nyielded but seven members in a total of 443. So glaringly undemocratic\r\nis the prevailing system that even that arch-aristocrat, Bismarck, was\r\nupon one occasion moved to denounce the three-class arrangement as\r\n\"the most miserable and absurd election law that has ever been\r\nformulated in any country.\"[384]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 384: For a brief exposition of the\r\n                   practical effects of the system, especially on\r\n                   political parties, see Lowell, Governments and\r\n                   Parties, I., 305-308. The system as it operates in\r\n                   the cities is described in Munro, The Government of\r\n                   European Cities, 128-135, and in R. C.

The Programme Formulated.*--Throughout more than a generation\r\nthere has been in Prussia persistent agitation in behalf of electoral\r\nreform. In 1883, and again in 1886, the lower chamber debated, but\r\nrejected, a project for the substitution of the secret ballot for the\r\nexisting _viva voce_ method of voting. In 1883 the Social Democratic\r\nparty proclaimed its purpose to abstain from voting until the      (p. 261)\r\ninequalities arising from \"the most wretched of all electoral systems\"\r\nshould have been removed. Gradually there was worked out a programme\r\nof reform to which socialists, Liberals, and progressives of various\r\nschools gave adherence, wholly or in part, comprising four principal\r\ndemands: (1) the abolition of discriminations against the small\r\ntaxpayer; (2) the introduction of the secret ballot; (3) the replacing\r\nof indirect by direct elections; and (4) a redistribution of seats.\r\nAnd these are to-day the objects chiefly sought by the reform\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n*280. The Efforts of 1906 and 1908.*--In 1906 a bill raising the number\r\nof representatives from 433 to 443 and making provision for a slight\r\nredistribution of seats was carried, but a Radical amendment providing\r\nfor direct and universal suffrage and the secret ballot was opposed\r\nwith vigor by the Government and failed of adoption. In January, 1908,\r\nthere were notable socialist demonstrations throughout the country in\r\nbehalf of the establishment of equal manhood suffrage. Prince von\r\nBülow, while admitting the existing system to be defective, opposed\r\nthe introduction in Prussia of the electoral system of the Empire,\r\nalleging that it would not be compatible with the interests of the\r\nstate and maintaining that every sound reform of the franchise must\r\nretain and secure the preponderance of the great mass of the middle\r\nclass, and therefore must aim at the establishment of an equitable\r\ngradation in the weight of the various classes of votes. It was added\r\nthat the Government would consider whether this object might best be\r\nattained by basing the franchise entirely upon the amount of taxes\r\npaid by the voter, or by taking into account age, educational\r\nattainments, or other qualifications. When the Radicals introduced in\r\nthe lower chamber a resolution declaring for equal manhood suffrage\r\nthe Clericals and the Poles supported it, but the Conservatives and\r\nNational Liberals of all shades stood by the Government, and the\r\nresolution was overwhelmingly rejected. The elections of June, 1908,\r\nat which, as has been pointed out, seven Social Democratic members\r\nwere returned, demonstrated that even under existing electoral\r\narrangements dissatisfaction could find some expression. The National\r\nLiberals and the Free Conservatives, who had been outspoken in\r\nopposition to the extension of the suffrage, lost, respectively,\r\ntwelve and four seats. When, however, the Radical resolution\r\nreappeared it again was thrown out.\r\n\r\n*281. The Project of 1910.*--By popular demonstrations in Berlin and in\r\nother important towns throughout the kingdom, the Government was\r\nbrought to the conviction that it was not expedient to maintain too\r\nlong its hitherto inflexible attitude. In a speech from the        (p. 262)\r\nthrone, January 11, 1910, the sovereign announced the early\r\nintroduction of a measure for electoral reform, and a month later it\r\nbecame the unwelcome duty of the new Chancellor, von Bethman-Hollweg,\r\nto lay the Government's project before the chambers. Instantly it was\r\nevident, not only that the proposal had been prepared entirely under\r\nbureaucratic direction, but that the real purpose of the Government\r\nwas to carry through the Landtag an electoral bill designed to appease\r\nthe reformers without yielding the essential features of the existing\r\nsystem. The project provided, in brief: (1) that the tripartite system\r\nbe retained, though the quota of taxes admitting to the first class\r\nshould be reduced to a uniform level of five thousand marks (no weight\r\nbeing given to payment beyond that amount), and voters of specified\r\ndegrees of education, or occupying certain official positions, or\r\nhaving served a stipulated number of years in the army or navy, should\r\nbe assigned to the higher classes, with but incidental regard to their\r\ntax contributions: (2) that _viva voce_ voting be retained; (3) that\r\nthe choice of electors be by districts rather than by Urwahlbezirke;\r\nand (4) that direct voting be substituted for indirect. There was no\r\nmention of redistribution, and the secret ballot was specifically\r\nwithheld. The rearrangement of classes did not touch the fundamental\r\ndifficulty, and the only demand of the reformers which was really met\r\nwas that for direct elections. In his speech in defense of the measure\r\nthe Chancellor frankly admitted that the Government was irrevocably\r\nopposed to a suffrage system based on democratic principles.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was ridiculed by the liberal elements. In protest against\r\nthe nonchalance with which the door had been shut in their faces the\r\nworking classes in Berlin and elsewhere entered upon a fresh series of\r\ndemonstrations by reason of which the Government was embarrassed\r\nthrough several weeks. In the Landtag the Conservative and Free\r\nConservative parties, comprising the Government majority, stood\r\nsolidly for the bill, in the conviction that if there must be change\r\nat all those changes which the bill proposed would be less\r\nobjectionable than those which were being urged by the radicals. The\r\nCentre wavered, while the National Liberals, the Poles, the Social\r\nDemocrats, and the Progressive People's Party stood firmly in\r\nopposition. February 13 the bill was referred in the lower house to a\r\ncommittee, by which it was reported so amended as to provide for the\r\nsecret ballot but not for direct elections. March 16, by a vote of 283\r\nto 168, the measure in this amended form, was passed by the chamber,\r\nall parties except the Conservatives and the Centre voting against it.\r\nApril 29 the bill was passed in the upper chamber, by a vote of 140 to\r\n94, in the form in which originally it had been introduced. All    (p. 263)\r\nefforts on the part of the Government to bring the lower house to an\r\nacceptance of the original measure proved fruitless, and the upshot\r\nwas that, May 27 following, the project was withdrawn from the\r\nchambers. The overhauling of the antiquated electoral system in\r\nPrussia, both national and municipal, remains a live issue, but\r\nagreement upon a definite project of reform is apparently remote. The\r\nproblem is enormously complicated by the virile traditions of\r\naristocratic, landed privilege which permeate the inmost parts of the\r\nPrussian political system. In respect to redistribution, too, a\r\nfundamental obstacle lies in the consideration that such a step on the\r\npart of Prussia would almost of necessity involve a similar one on the\r\npart of the Empire. In both instances the insuperable objection, from\r\nthe point of view of the Government, arises from the vast acquisition\r\nof political power which would accrue from such reform to the\r\nsocialists and other radical parties.[385]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 385: P.

ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE LANDTAG\r\n\r\n*282. Sessions and Privileges of Members.*--The maximum life of a\r\nLandtag is five years; but the lower house may at any time be\r\ndissolved by the crown. A dissolution must be followed by the election\r\nof a new chamber within sixty days, and the ensuing session is\r\nrequired to begin within three months. The power of dissolution is not\r\ninfrequently exercised, and there have been instances of the\r\ndissolution of a newly elected chamber, by reason of its objectionable\r\npolitical character, before it had been convened for so much as a\r\nsingle sitting. According to law the Landtag must be convoked in\r\nregular session every year, during the period between the beginning of\r\nNovember and the middle of the following January.[386] It may be\r\ncalled in extraordinary session at any time. Without its own consent,\r\nit may not be adjourned for more than thirty days, or more than once\r\nduring a session. Save in the event of the necessity of making\r\nprovision for a regency, the chambers sit separately; but the two must\r\nbe convoked, opened, adjourned, and prorogued simultaneously.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 386: Art. 76.]\r\n\r\nEach chamber passes upon the qualifications of its members; each\r\nelects it own presidents, vice-presidents, and secretaries; and each\r\nregulates its own discipline and order of business. Sittings of both\r\nchambers are public, save when, on proposal of the president or of ten\r\nmembers, it is decided to close the doors. Members are regarded    (p. 264)\r\nas representatives of the population of the kingdom as a whole. They\r\nmay not be bound by any sort of instructions; nor may they be called\r\nto account legally for votes cast, or for statements made, in the\r\nfulfillment of their legislative functions. Unless taken in the act,\r\nor within twenty-four hours thereafter, no member of either house may,\r\nwithout the consent of that house, be arrested or submitted to\r\nexamination for any penal offense. Members of the lower house receive,\r\nand must accept, travelling expenses and a daily allowance of fifteen\r\nmarks during sessions.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each sitting the House of Lords is divided into\r\nfive Abtheilungen, or sections, and the House of Representatives into\r\nseven. In the lower house the division is made by lot; in the upper,\r\nby the president. In both instances it is made once for an entire\r\nsession, not monthly as in France, or bi-monthly as in Italy. The\r\nfunction of the Abtheilungen is to appoint committee members, and, in\r\nthe lower house, to make preliminary examination of election returns.\r\nIn each house there are eight standing committees. For the\r\nconsideration of particular measures special committees are\r\nconstituted as occasion demands.\r\n\r\n*283. Powers.*--The Landtag is, of course, primarily a legislative\r\ninstitution. But the powers of independent deliberation which it\r\nexercises are distinctly inferior to those exercised by the British\r\nHouse of Commons, by the French Chamber of Deputies, or by any one of\r\na half score of other European parliamentary bodies. This fact arises\r\nfrom the relatively preponderating influence which is exerted by the\r\nGovernment in its proceedings. In theory each chamber possesses the\r\nright to initiate legislation; in practice, virtually all bills are\r\nintroduced by the Government, and the chambers content themselves with\r\ndiscussion and the proposing of amendments. It not infrequently\r\nhappens that, as in the case of the Electoral Reform Bill of 1910, the\r\nlower house so emasculates a measure as to compel the Government to\r\nwithdraw it. But, speaking broadly, it may be said that the\r\nlegislative acts of Prussia are projected and formulated by the crown\r\nand the ministers and merely ratified by the Landtag. There is still\r\nsome question as to whether the stipulation that all laws require the\r\nassent of the two houses covers, under every circumstance, the\r\nappropriation of money. In practice, appropriations are regularly\r\nvoted in the chambers, and in fact it is required that the budget and\r\nall fiscal measures shall be presented first to the lower house and\r\nshall be accepted or rejected as a whole by the upper; but during the\r\nyears immediately preceding the Austrian war of 1866 the Government\r\nasserted and exercised the power of collecting and expending the revenues\r\nof the state on the basis of standing laws, thus virtually         (p. 265)\r\nsuspending the legislative appropriating power, and the question has\r\nnever been finally settled by Prussian jurists as to whether such a\r\nthing might not again be done.[387]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 387: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   298.]\r\n\r\nOn the side of administration the powers of the Landtag are but\r\nnominal. Under provisions of the constitution each chamber has a right\r\nto present memorials to the king; to refer to the ministers documents\r\naddressed to it, and to demand explanations respecting complaints made\r\ntherein; and to appoint commissions for the investigation of subjects\r\nfor its own information. The right of interpellation is expressly\r\nrecognized. But, as has been pointed out, the ministers are not in\r\npractice responsible to the legislative chambers, and neither they nor\r\nthe king himself can be compelled to give heed, unless they so desire,\r\nto legislative protests, demands, or censure. Where a parliamentary\r\nsystem does not exist, the influence of the legislative branch upon\r\nmatters of administration is likely to be confined to the simple\r\nassertion of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: ORIGINS AND PRINCIPLES[388]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 388: The judicial system of Prussia,\r\n                   regulated in common with that of the other states\r\n                   by Imperial law, is described in Chapter 11, pp.\r\n                   241-244. Articles 86-97 of the Prussian\r\n                   constitution deal with the subject of the\r\n                   judiciary, but many of their provisions have been\r\n                   rendered obsolete by Imperial statutes.]\r\n\r\n*284. The Measures of Stein and Hardenberg.*--The origins of the local\r\ngovernmental régime prevailing in the kingdom of Prussia to-day\r\nantedate, to some extent, the nineteenth century, but in large part\r\nthey are to be traced to the period of the Stein-Hardenberg\r\nministries. By the memorable Municipal Edict (_Städt-Ordnung_) of\r\nNovember 19, 1808, Stein set up a complete municipal system, with\r\nburgomasters, executive boards, and town councils (all elective), and\r\nswept away the oligarchy of the guilds, broadened the franchise, and\r\nconferred upon the towns almost complete independence, even in the\r\nmatter of taxation. An edict of 1831 inaugurated a revival of the\r\nright of the central authorities to supervise local taxation and\r\nintroduced a number of other changes, but, on the whole, the municipal\r\narrangements of the present day are based upon the edict of Stein.\r\nMore immediately, they rest upon an act of 1853, applied originally\r\nonly to the six eastern provinces of the kingdom, but eventually\r\nextended to the others. Aside from its introduction of the three-class\r\nelectoral system, and a few other matters, this law follows closely\r\nthe measure of 1808 and but consolidates and extends pre-existing\r\narrangements.[389] Neither Stein nor Hardenberg touched the        (p. 266)\r\nconstitution of the country communes, but the extension, during the\r\nNapoleonic occupation, of the French communal system into all the\r\nPrussian territories west of the Elbe prepared the way for the\r\nessentially uniform system which was established by the Westphalian\r\nand Rhineland Edicts of 1841 and 1845. Edicts of 1807 and 1811\r\nabolished the aristocratic basis of the ancient circles (Kreise), and\r\nafter 1815 the circle as a unit of local government next above the\r\ncommune was extended to all the conquered or reconquered territories.\r\nThe revival of the old provincial organization was begun also in 1815,\r\nwhen the kingdom was divided into ten provinces; and in the same year\r\nthere were established twenty-six government districts (Regierungsbezirke),\r\ntwo or three within each province, each under the control of one of\r\nthe government boards (Regierungen) whose creation had been begun in\r\n1808.[390]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 389: The text of the law of 1853 is\r\n                   printed in the appendix of A. W. Jebens, Die\r\n                   Städtverordneten (Berlin, 1905).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 390: E. Meier, Die Reform der\r\n                   Verwaltungsorganisation unter Stein und Hardenberg\r\n                   (Leipzig, 1881).]\r\n\r\n*285. The Reforms of Bismarck.*--Throughout the middle portion of the\r\nnineteenth century the administrative system, modified but slightly by\r\nlegislative enactment, continued to present a curious combination of\r\nelements which were popular and elements which were narrowly\r\nbureaucratic and, in some instances, essentially feudal. Beginning in\r\n1872, Bismarck addressed himself to the task of co-ordinating,\r\nstrengthening, and to a certain extent liberalizing, the local\r\ninstitutions of the kingdom. The ends at which he aimed principally\r\nwere the abolition of conditions by which it was made possible for the\r\nwhole machinery of local government to be captured from time to time\r\nby a single social class for its own benefit, and the establishment of\r\na system under which all classes of the population might be admitted\r\nto participation in the management of purely local affairs. In the\r\ncourse of the reform which was carried through numerous features of\r\nEnglish local institutions were copied with some closeness. In a\r\nnumber of scholarly volumes appearing between 1863 and 1872 the genius\r\nof these institutions had been convincingly expounded by the jurist\r\nRudolph Gneist, whose essential thesis was that the failure of\r\nparliamentary government in Prussia and the success of it in Great\r\nBritain was attributable to the dissimilarity of the local\r\ngovernmental systems of the two countries;[391] and by these writings\r\nthe practical proposals with which Bismarck came forward were given\r\nimportant theoretic basis. Neither Gneist nor Bismarck sympathized\r\nwith the ideals of democracy, but both believed that the local     (p. 267)\r\nadministrative authorities should be made to include not only a\r\npaid, expert bureaucracy but a considerable element of unpaid lay or\r\nnon-official persons, drawn, however, principally from the large\r\nlandowners and taxpayers. The obstacles to be overcome, arising from\r\npublic indifference, the opposition of the existing bureaucracy, the\r\napprehensions of the Conservatives, and sectional differences and\r\nantipathies, were enormous, but by proceeding slowly and in a\r\nconciliatory spirit the Government was able eventually to execute the\r\nlarger portion of its plans. The first enactments, for the circles in\r\n1872 and for the provinces in 1875, were applied only to those\r\nprovinces which had formed the old monarchy, but during the ensuing\r\nten years similar measures were extended to the remainder of the\r\nkingdom, and, finally, after the dismissal of Bismarck, the task was\r\nrounded out by a great Landgemeinde-Ordnung issued for the seven\r\neastern provinces in 1891. By this series of enactments the\r\nadministrative methods and machinery of the kingdom were reduced to\r\nsubstantially the character which they to-day possess.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 391: The most important of Gneist's works\r\n                   in this connection are: Geschichte des\r\n                   self-government in England (1863); Verwaltung,\r\n                   Justiz, Rechtsweg (1867); Die preussische\r\n                   Kreis-Ordnung (1871); and Der Rechtsstaat (1872).]\r\n\r\n*286. Principles of the Administrative System.*--Although the system is\r\nstill one of the most complicated in Europe, it is infinitely simpler\r\nthan once it was, and the bureaucratic forces in it, if still\r\npredominant, have been subjected to a variety of important restraints.\r\nThe principles which underlie it have been summarized by an English\r\nwriter as follows: \"The first is the careful distinction drawn between\r\nthose internal affairs in which the central government is thought to\r\nbe directly concerned, and those which are held to be primarily of\r\nonly local interest. The former group includes, besides the army, the\r\nstate taxes and domains, ecclesiastical affairs, police (in the wide\r\nPrussian meaning of the term), and the supervision of local\r\nauthorities; whilst roads, poor relief, and a number of miscellaneous\r\nmatters are left to the localities. These two groups are kept\r\ncarefully separate, even when they are entrusted to the same\r\nauthority. Secondly, the work of the central government is\r\n'deconcentrated,' that is, the country is divided into districts\r\n(which may or may not be coincident with the areas of local\r\nself-government), in each of which there is a delegation of the\r\ncentral authority, doing its work, and thereby lessening the pressure\r\nupon the departmental offices in Berlin. Something like this\r\ndeconcentration is found in the educational organization of France,\r\nand also in the office of the Prefect, but it is far more elaborate,\r\nand the machinery much more complex, in Prussia. Thirdly the\r\ncomparative independence of the executive from the deliberative\r\nauthority, and the predominance of the officials, which characterize\r\nthe central government of Prussia, repeat themselves throughout the\r\nwhole of local government. And, finally, in all except the         (p. 268)\r\nlargest of the Prussian areas of local self-government, the executive\r\nagents of the locality, elected by it, are also the representatives of\r\nthe central government; as such they are members of the bureaucracy\r\nand controlled by it, and in consequence they naturally look to the\r\ncenter for guidance and direction in regard to local affairs.\r\nTherefore, whilst it would be inaccurate to say that local\r\nself-government, as understood in England, does not exist in Prussia,\r\nit is true that self-government there is weak, that it is not so much\r\nthe exercise of the will of the locality within limits prescribed (for\r\nthe protection of the whole community) by the central power, as the\r\nexercise of the will of the latter by the locality. In fact, the\r\nbureaucracy rules; and it is fortunate for Prussia that hitherto the\r\nbureaucracy has remained intelligent and respective of new\r\nideas.\"[392]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 392: Ashley, Local and Central\r\n                   Government, 130-132.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is to be observed that, while the professional,\r\nlife-long holders of office continue to preponderate as in no other\r\nimportant country of western Europe, the class of non-professionals is\r\nlarge and constantly increasing. As a rule, the first class is\r\nsalaried, the second is not; the non-professionals being simply\r\ncitizens who, moved by considerations of a civic and social nature,\r\ngive their services without prospect of pecuniary reward. The\r\nprinciple of the system is, as Ashley characterizes it, that of\r\ngovernment by experts, checked by lay criticism and the power of the\r\npurse, and effectively controlled by the central authorities. And,\r\nalthough the details of local governmental arrangements vary\r\nappreciably from state to state, this principle, which has attained\r\nits fullest realization in Prussia, may be said to underlie local\r\ngovernment throughout the Empire in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: AREAS AND ORGANS\r\n\r\n*287. The Province.*--Aside from the cities, which have their special\r\nforms of government, the political units of Prussia, in the order of\r\ntheir magnitude, are: (1) the Provinz, or province; (2) the\r\nRegierungsbezirk, or district; (3) the Kreis, or circle; (4) the\r\nAmtsbezirk, or court jurisdiction; and (5) the Gemeinde, or commune.\r\nOf these, three--the first, third, and fifth--are spheres both of the\r\ncentral administration and of local self-government; two--the second\r\nand fourth--exist for administrative purposes solely. Of provinces\r\nthere are twelve: East Prussia, West Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania,\r\nSilesia, Posen, Westphalia, Saxony, Hanover, the Rhine Province,\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, and Hesse-Nassau.[393] Unlike the French and   (p. 269)\r\nItalian departments, the Prussian provinces are historical areas,\r\nof widely varying extent and, in some instances, of not even wholly\r\ncontinuous territory. Thus Hanover is, geographically, the kingdom\r\nonce united with the crown of Great Britain, Schleswig-Holstein\r\ncomprises the territories wrested from Denmark in 1864, Saxony is the\r\ncountry taken from the kingdom of Saxony at the close of the\r\nNapoleonic wars, and Posen represents Prussia's ultimate acquisition\r\nfrom the Polish partitions of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 393: For all practical purposes the city\r\n                   of Berlin and the district of Hohenzollern form\r\n                   each a province. If they be counted, the total is\r\n                   fourteen.]\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the province the separation of functions\r\nrelating to the affairs of the kingdom (_Staatsgeschäfte_) from those\r\nwhich relate only to matters of a local nature is carried out rigidly.\r\nIn the circle, as will appear, the two sets of functions are\r\ndischarged by the same body of officials; in the district, the\r\nfunctions performed are wholly of a national, rather than a local,\r\ncharacter; but in the province there are not merely two sets of\r\nfunctions but two entirely separate groups of officials.\r\n\r\n*288. Provincial Organs of the Central Administration.*--For the\r\nadministration of affairs of general interest, such as police,\r\neducation, and religion, the organs within the province are (1) the\r\nOberpräsident, or chief president, appointed by the king to represent\r\nthe central government in the management of all such matters as\r\nconcern the entire province or reach beyond the jurisdiction of a\r\nsingle Regierungsbezirk administration,[394] and (2) the\r\nProvinzialrath, a provincial council consisting of, besides the\r\nOberpräsident or his representative as presiding officer, one\r\nprofessional member appointed for an indefinite tenure by the Minister\r\nof the Interior and five ordinary citizen members elected, usually for\r\na term of six years, by the provincial Ausschuss, or committee. The\r\nOberpräsident is the immediate agent of the ministry, as is the\r\nprefect in France, though he is a more dignified and important\r\nfunctionary than his French counterpart. None the less, by virtue of\r\nthe fact that most of the Oberpräsident's acts are valid only after\r\nhaving been accorded the assent of a body the majority of whose\r\nmembers are chosen within the province, the bureaucratic aspect of his\r\nposition is subjected to a highly important limitation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 394: Schulze, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Königreichs Preussen, 63.]\r\n\r\n*289. Provincial Organs of Self-Government.*--By the side of this\r\nofficial group stands another, quite independent of it, for the\r\ncontrol of affairs of purely local concern. Its organs comprise: (1)\r\nthe Provinzialausschuss, or provincial committee, consisting of from\r\nseven to fourteen members elected for six years by the provincial  (p. 270)\r\nLandtag, not necessarily, but almost invariably, from its own\r\nmembership; (2) a Landeshauptmann or Landesdirektor, a salaried\r\nexecutive official elected by the Landtag for six or twelve years and\r\nconfirmed by the crown; and (3) the Provinziallandtag, or provincial\r\nassembly. The Landeshauptmann is the executive, the Provinzialausschuss\r\nthe consultative, organ of local self-administration; the\r\nProvinziallandtag is the provincial legislature. Members of the\r\nLandtag are elected for six years (one-half retiring every three\r\nyears) by the diets of the circles, and they comprise, as a rule,\r\nlocal administrative officials of the circles, large landowners, and\r\nother well-to-do persons. Sessions are convoked by the crown at least\r\nevery two years.[395] The Landtag's functions are comprehensive. They\r\ninclude the supervision of charities, highways, and industry; the\r\nvoting of local taxes and the apportionment of them among the circles;\r\nthe enactment of local laws; the custody of provincial property; the\r\nelection of the Landeshauptmann and the members of the provincial\r\ncommittee; and the giving of advice on provincial matters at the\r\nrequest of the central government. The Landtag is in practice less\r\nindependent, however, than this enumeration of powers might seem to\r\nimply. All of its legislation requires the assent of the king; most of\r\nits fiscal arrangements must be submitted to one or more of the\r\nministers; and the body itself may be dissolved at any time by the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 395: Towns of twenty-five thousand\r\n                   inhabitants or more may, by ministerial decree, be\r\n                   set off as separate circles. In such circles\r\n                   Landtag members are chosen by the municipal\r\n                   officials.]\r\n\r\n*290. The Government District.*--Each province is divided into a number\r\nof Regierungsbezirke, or districts, of which there are now thirty-five\r\nin the kingdom.[396] Unlike the province, the district exists for\r\npurposes of general administration only. It therefore has no organs of\r\nself-government. Its Regierung, or \"administration,\" consists of a\r\nbody of professional, salaried officials, appointed by the crown and\r\nhaving at its head the Regierungspräsident, who is, on the whole, the\r\nmost important official in the Prussian local service. The subjects\r\nthat fall within the jurisdiction of the functionaries of the\r\ndistrict, including taxation, education, religion, forests, etc., are\r\nvery comprehensive, and the work of administration is carried on\r\nchiefly through \"colleges,\" or boards. For the management of police\r\nand the supervision of local bodies there exists a Bezirksausschuss,\r\nor district committee, composed of the Regierungspräsident, two    (p. 271)\r\nother persons appointed by the crown, and four members elected by the\r\nProvinzialausschuss for six years. A very important function which\r\nthis body has possessed since 1883 is that of sitting, under the\r\npresidency of one of its members appointed for his judicial\r\nqualifications, as the administrative court of the district.[397]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 396: The province of Schleswig-Holstein,\r\n                   however, contains but a single district. The\r\n                   largest number of districts in a province is six,\r\n                   in Hanover.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 397: The immediate legal basis of the\r\n                   organization of the district is the\r\n                   Landesverwaltungsgesetz of 1883.]\r\n\r\n*291. The Circle.*--In the Kreis, or circle, as in the province, there\r\nexist two sharply distinguished sets of governmental functions, the\r\ngeneral and the local; but for the administration of both there is a\r\nsingle hierarchy of officials. The number of circles within the\r\nkingdom is about 490, with populations varying from 20,000 to 80,000.\r\nEach includes all towns lying within it which have a population of\r\nless than 25,000. A town of over 25,000 is likely to be created, by\r\nministerial order, a circle within itself, in which case the functions\r\nof government are exercised by the municipal authorities.[398] The\r\nessential organs of government within the Landkreise, or country\r\ncircles, are three: the Landrath, the Kreisausschuss, and the\r\nKreistag. The Landrath is appointed for life by the crown, on\r\nnomination frequently by the Kreistag, or diet. He superintends all\r\nadministrative affairs, general and local, within the circle; fulfills\r\nthe functions of chief of police; presides over the Kreisausschuss and\r\nKreistag; and, in general, occupies within the circle the place\r\noccupied within the province by the Oberpräsident. Associated with\r\nhim, and organized under his presidency, is the Kreisausschuss, or\r\ncircle committee, composed of six unofficial members elected by the\r\nKreistag for six years. In addition to its consultative functions, the\r\nKreisausschuss sits as an administrative court of lowest grade.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 398: Approximately one hundred towns have\r\n                   been so constituted.]\r\n\r\nThe Kreistag is the legislative body of the circle. Its members,\r\nnumbering at least twenty-five, are elected for a term of six years by\r\nthree Verbände, or colleges, the first being made up of the cities,\r\nthe second of the large rural taxpayers, the third of a complicated\r\ngroup of rural interests in which the smaller taxpayers and delegates\r\nof the communal assemblies preponderate.[399] The Kreistag is a body\r\nof substantial importance. It chooses, directly or indirectly, all the\r\nelective officials of the circle, of the district, and of the\r\nprovince; it creates local officers and regulates their functions; it\r\nenacts legislation of a local nature; and it votes the taxes required\r\nfor both its own and the provincial administration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 399: For a fuller statement of the\r\n                   electoral system see Lowell, Governments and\r\n                   Parties, I., 325.]\r\n\r\n*292. The Commune.*--The smallest of Prussian governmental units   (p. 272)\r\nis the Gemeinde, or commune.[400] Of communes there are two distinct\r\ntypes, the rural (Landgemeinde) and the urban (Stadtgemeinde). The\r\ngovernments of the rural communes (some 36,000 in number) are so\r\nvaried that any general description of them is virtually impossible.\r\nThey rest largely upon local custom, though reduced at some points to\r\na reasonable uniformity under regulating statutes such as were enacted\r\nfor the communes of eight of the twelve provinces in the\r\nLandgemeinde-ordnung of 1891.[401] There is invariably an elective\r\nSchulze, or chief magistrate. He is assisted ordinarily by from two to\r\nsix aldermen (Schöffen) or councillors. And there is generally a\r\ngoverning body (Gemeindevertretung), composed of elected representatives,\r\nwhen there are as many as forty qualified electors,--otherwise\r\nthe people acting in the capacity of a primary assembly\r\n(Gemeindeversammlung),--for the decision of matters relating to local\r\nschools, churches, highways, and similar interests. It is to be\r\nobserved, however, that most of the rural communes are so small that\r\nthey have neither the financial resources nor the administrative\r\nability to maintain a government of much virility. Such action as is\r\ntaken within them is taken almost invariably with the approval of, and\r\nunder the guidance of, the authorities of the circle, principally the\r\nLandrath.[402]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 400: The Amtsbezirk is essentially a\r\n                   judicial district.

The usual organs comprise (1) the Stadtrath,    (p. 273)\r\nan executive body consisting of a burgomaster and a number of\r\nassistants, elected for six, nine, or twelve years, or even for life,\r\nand (2) the Stadtverordnete, or municipal council, chosen for from\r\nthree to six years, as a rule by an electorate identical with that\r\nwhich returns the members of the lower branch of the Prussian\r\nLandtag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV                                                        (p. 274)\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR GERMAN STATES--ALSACE-LORRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\n*293. Essential Similarity of Political Institutions.*--The\r\npreponderance of Prussia among the twenty-five states comprised within\r\nthe German Empire is such as to lend the governmental system of that\r\nkingdom an interest and an importance which attaches to the political\r\narrangements of no one of the remaining members of the federation. No\r\ndescription of German governments would be adequate, none the less,\r\nwhich should ignore wholly the minor states. A number of these states,\r\nespecially Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Saxony, are of\r\nconsiderable size, and the populations which are governed within them\r\napproximate, or exceed, the populations of certain wholly independent\r\nEuropean nations, as Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Portugal, and\r\nseveral of the states of the southeast. It would be unnecessary,\r\nhowever, even were it possible, to describe in this place twenty-five\r\nsubstantially independent German governmental systems. Despite no\r\ninconsiderable variation, there are many fundamental features which\r\nthey, or the majority of them, possess in common. All save\r\nthree--Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck--are monarchies. All save\r\ntwo--Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz--have written\r\nconstitutions[403] and elective legislative chambers. In every one of\r\nthe monarchies the total lack of anything in the nature of ministerial\r\nresponsibility to a parliamentary body leaves the way open for the\r\nmaintenance of vigorous and independent royal authority, and it is not\r\ntoo much to say that in all of them, as is pre-eminently true in\r\nPrussia, the principle of autocracy lies at the root of both the\r\norganization and the methods of government. Local governmental\r\narrangements and systems of administration of justice have been\r\ncopied, in most instances, from Prussia. It will suffice to speak very\r\nbriefly, first of a few of the more important monarchies, and\r\nsubsequently of the city-state republics.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 403: The texts of these constitutions, in\r\n                   the form in which they existed in 1884, are printed\r\n                   in Stoerk, Handbuch der deutschen Verfassungen.\r\n                   Even in the Mecklenburgs there are certain written\r\n                   instruments by which the curiously mediæval system\r\n                   of government there prevailing is in a measure\r\n                   regulated.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MORE IMPORTANT MONARCHIES                                   (p. 275)\r\n\r\n*294. Bavaria: Crown and Ministry.*--After Prussia, the most important\r\nof the German states, in point both of area and of population, is the\r\nkingdom of Bavaria. The constitution at present in operation in\r\nBavaria was promulgated May 26, 1818, though it has undergone no\r\nslight modification through the process of amendment since that\r\ndate.[404] The original instrument replaced a fundamental law of May,\r\n1808, devised by the king of Bavaria in imitation of the constitution\r\ngiven some months before by Napoleon to the kingdom of Westphalia; and\r\neven the present frame of government bears unmistakable evidence of\r\nFrench influence. The functions and prerogatives of king and ministers\r\nare substantially what they are in Prussia.[405] In addition to the\r\nMinistry of State, consisting of the seven heads of departments, there\r\nis an advisory Staatsrath, or Council of State, comprising, besides\r\nthe ministers, one prince of the royal blood and eight other members.\r\nIn accordance with royal proclamation important acts of the government\r\nrequire the countersignature of all of the ministers. This, of itself,\r\ndoes not imply any larger measure of ministerial subordination than\r\nexists elsewhere in German governments, but it is worth observing that\r\nduring a prolonged period, especially after 1869, there was persistent\r\neffort on the part of the Clericals to inject into the Bavarian system\r\nthe principle of ministerial responsibility in the parliamentary sense\r\nof the phrase, and that although the attempt was by no means wholly\r\nsuccessful, it is true that in Bavaria the ministers occupy in\r\npractice a somewhat less independent position than in other German\r\nmonarchies. The device of interpellation, for example, not only exists\r\nin theory; it means something, as elsewhere in Germany it does not, in\r\nactual operation. If a minister will not answer an interpellation that\r\nis addressed to him, he is obliged by law at least to give reasons for\r\nhis refusal.[406]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 404: Among amendments the most notable\r\n                   have been that of March 9, 1828, relating to the\r\n                   composition of the upper legislative chamber; those\r\n                   of June 4, 1848, and March 21, 1881, by which was\r\n                   modified the composition of the lower house; and\r\n                   that of April 8, 1906, whereby direct elections\r\n                   were substituted for indirect.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 405: The crown is hereditary in the house\r\n                   of Wittelbach, by which it was acquired as early as\r\n                   1180. From 1886, the king, Otto I., being insane,\r\n                   the powers of the sovereign were exercised by the\r\n                   prince regent Luitpold, until his death December\r\n                   12, 1912.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 406: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   338.]\r\n\r\n*295. The Bavarian Landtag.*--The Landtag of Bavaria consists of two\r\nchambers. The upper, designated officially as the Kammer der Reichsrate\r\n(\"chamber of the council of the Empire\"), is composed of princes   (p. 276)\r\nof the royal family, crown dignitaries, high ecclesiastics, hereditary\r\nnobles, and life members appointed by the crown--in all, some\r\neighty-five to ninety persons. The lower chamber, or Abgeordnetenkammer,\r\nconsists of 163 members. By law of 1881 the class system of voting in\r\nBavaria was replaced by an equal suffrage extended to all males paying\r\na direct tax. Elections continued to be indirect until 1906, when\r\nprovision was made for elections by direct and secret ballot.[407]\r\nDeputies are chosen for a term of six years and are apportioned in\r\nsuch a manner that, normally, there is one for every 38,000 people.\r\nEvery male inhabitant is entitled to vote who at the time of the\r\nelection has completed his twenty-fifth year, has been a Bavarian\r\ncitizen during at least one year, and has paid to the state a direct\r\ntax during at least the same period. The Landtag must be summoned not\r\nless frequently than once every three years.[408] The budget is made\r\nup on a two-year basis, so that sessions are held, in point of fact,\r\nbiennially.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 407: Grassman, Die bayerische\r\n                   Landtagswahlgesetz vom 8 April, 1906, in Jahrbuch\r\n                   des Oeffentlichen Rechts der Gegenwart, I., 242. A\r\n                   law of April 15, 1908, introduced the principle of\r\n                   proportional representation in Bavarian municipal\r\n                   elections.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 408: M. von Seydel, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Königreichs Bayern, (Freiburg, 1888), in\r\n                   Marquardsen's Handbuch; E. Junod, La Bavière et\r\n                   l'Empire allemande, in _Annales de l'École Libre\r\n                   des Sciences Politiques_, Apr. 15, 1892.]\r\n\r\n*296. Saxony: Crown and Ministry.*--Third among the states of the Empire\r\nin population, though fifth in area, is the kingdom of Saxony. The\r\npresent Saxon constitution was promulgated September 4, 1831, under\r\nthe influence of the revolutionary movements of 1830. By it a monarchy\r\ngoverned under a mediæval system of estates was converted into a\r\nmonarchy governed, at least nominally, under a modern representative\r\nrégime. In point of fact, however, the inauguration of constitutionalism\r\ntempered the actual authority of the monarch very slightly. The king is\r\nstill in every sense the supreme authority within the state.[409] He\r\nappoints and dismisses ministers at will, issues ordinances with the\r\nforce of law, and exercises far-reaching control over the processes of\r\nlegislation. Upon the failure of the chambers to vote supplies which\r\nare held to be essential, he may even collect and expend revenues for\r\na year on no authority apart from his own. For purposes of administrative\r\nsupervision there are ministers of War, Finance, Justice, Foreign\r\nAffairs, the Interior, and Education, and the ministers collectively\r\ncomprise a Gesammt-Ministerium, or ministry of state. Measures of the\r\ncrown are countersigned by a minister; but there is no means by which\r\na minister may be forced out of office against the will of the     (p. 277)\r\nking by a hostile legislative chamber.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 409: The crown is hereditary in the\r\n                   Albertine line of the house of Wettin, with\r\n                   reversion to the Ernestine line, of which the duke\r\n                   of Saxe-Weimar is now the head. The present\r\n                   sovereign is Frederick August III.]\r\n\r\n*297. The Saxon Legislative Chambers.*--The Saxon legislature\r\n(Standeversammlung) consists of two houses. The upper, designated\r\nsimply as the First Chamber, is a composite body consisting of\r\nforty-six members, in addition to a variable number of adult princes\r\nof the royal house. The membership comprises, principally, (1)\r\nimportant prelates; (2) certain university officials; (3) proprietors\r\nof great estates, twelve elected and ten appointed by the crown for\r\nlife: (4) the first magistrates of Dresden and Leipzig; (5) six\r\nburgomasters of other cities, designated by the king; and (6) five\r\nnobles named for life by free choice of the king. The lower house\r\nconsists of ninety-one deputies, of whom forty-three are elected by\r\nthe towns and forty-eight by the rural communes. At one time members\r\nwere chosen by direct secret ballot under a general and equal suffrage\r\nbased upon a small tax qualification. Fear of socialism led, however,\r\nto the adoption, in 1896, of a new system under which the tax\r\nqualification was retained, indirect elections were substituted for\r\ndirect and public voting for the secret ballot, and a three-class\r\nscheme was brought into operation which threw political preponderance\r\ninto the hands of the well-to-do scarcely less effectively than does\r\nthe three-class arrangement in Prussia.\r\n\r\nAfter prolonged agitation the reactionary measure of 1896 was replaced\r\nby a comprehensive electoral law of May 5, 1909 by which direct and\r\nsecret voting was re-established and the interests of property were\r\nsought to be safeguarded by a newly devised system of plural votes. As\r\nthe law now stands (1) all males who have attained the age of\r\ntwenty-five and who pay direct taxes are entitled to one vote; (2) men\r\nowning two hectares of land, or paying a tax upon an annual income of\r\n1,250, 1,400, or 1,600 marks, according, respectively, as such income\r\nis drawn from land, public office, or general sources, and men who\r\nhave passed certain examinations, are entitled to two votes; (3)\r\nvoters paying taxes yearly, as above, upon an income of 1,600, 1,900,\r\nor 2,200 marks, or who possess four hectares of land, or who as\r\nteachers, engineers, artists, or writers earn an income of 1,900\r\nmarks, possess three votes; (4) persons paying a tax, as above, on an\r\nincome of 2,200, 2,500, or 2,800 marks, or owning eight hectares of\r\nland, have four votes; and (5) every person belonging to the first,\r\nsecond, or third of these classes is allotted an additional vote when\r\nhe attains the age of fifty, the total number of votes possessed by\r\none elector never exceeding four. Curiously enough, at the first\r\nelections held under this law, in October, 1909, the socialists,   (p. 278)\r\nwho previously were represented by but a single member, gained\r\ntwenty-five seats, or upwards of a third of the entire number. The\r\nchambers must be summoned by the king at least once in two years. Both\r\nmay propose measures, but in practice leadership in the business of\r\nlegislation is left very largely to the king and ministry.[410]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 410: O. Mayer, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Königreichs Sachsen (Tübingen, 1909).]\r\n\r\n*298. Württemberg: Crown and Ministry.*--The constitution of the kingdom\r\nof Württemberg was promulgated, following prolonged political\r\ncontroversy, September 25, 1819. At the head of the state is the king,\r\nwhose powers are in some respects even larger than those belonging to\r\nother German sovereigns.[411] It is required that all political acts,\r\nexcept the bestowing of titles of nobility, shall be performed only\r\nwith the sanction in writing of a minister; but, by reason of the\r\nking's absolute control of the ministry, this constitutes no invasion\r\nof the crown's essential prerogative. Of ministers there are six.\r\nThese collectively comprise the Ministry of State, and they, together\r\nwith certain appointive councillors, likewise constitute the\r\nGeheimerrath, or Privy Council, which the sovereign consults at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 411: The reigning sovereign is William\r\n                   II.]\r\n\r\n*299. The Assembly of Estates: Proportional Representation.*--The\r\nlegislative body of Württemberg is known as the Standeversammlung, or\r\nAssembly of Estates. The upper chamber,--the Standesherren, or House\r\nof Lords,--consists of princes of the royal family; other princes,\r\nunder varying conditions; knights; ecclesiastical dignitaries; and\r\nmembers appointed by the crown, in part according to stipulated\r\nconditions and in part without reference to any necessary\r\nconsideration of birth, wealth, or religious affiliation. The\r\nAbgeordnetenhaus, or House of Deputies, consists of ninety-two members\r\nchosen for a term of six years, as follows: one from each of the\r\nadministrative divisions (Oberamtsbezirke); six from Stuttgart and one\r\nfrom each of six other important towns; nine from the Neckar and Jagst\r\ncircle; and eight from the Black Forest and Danube circle. Election is\r\nby direct and secret ballot, on a basis of universal suffrage for\r\nmales over twenty-five years of age. By constitutional amendment of\r\nJuly 16, 1906, there was introduced a scheme of proportional\r\nrepresentation under which the six deputies of Stuttgart and the\r\nseventeen of the Neckar and Jagst and the Black Forest and Danube\r\ncircles are distributed among the several political groups in\r\napproximate proportion to the numerical strength attained by these\r\ngroups at the polls. This system, an innovation in Germany, was tested\r\nin the elections of December, 1906, and January, 1907, and was by most\r\npersons adjudged satisfactory.[412]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 412: J. Fontaine, La représentation\r\n                   proportionnelle en Württemberg, in _Revue Politique\r\n                   et Parlementaire_, Jan., 1911; ibid., La\r\n                   représentation proportionnelle en Württemberg\r\n                   (Paris, 1909).]\r\n\r\nThe remaining sixty-nine representatives are chosen still in       (p. 279)\r\nsingle member districts. Prior to the amendment of 1906, the chamber\r\nwas made up of seventy members chosen popularly and of twenty-three who\r\nsat as representatives of privileged or corporate interests--thirteen\r\nchosen by the landowning nobility, nine dignitaries of the Protestant\r\nand Catholic churches, together with the Chancellor of the University\r\nof Tübingen.[413]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 413: G.

The Government of Baden.*--In July, 1808, a constitutional edict\r\nwas promulgated in Baden in imitation of the fundamental law which\r\nNapoleon in the previous year had bestowed upon the kingdom of\r\nWestphalia. August 22, 1818, this instrument was replaced by the\r\nconstitution at present in operation. Executive power is vested in the\r\ngrand-duke, with the customary provision for ministerial\r\ncountersignature. Legislative power is shared by the monarch with a\r\nLandstände of two houses. Under a liberalizing law of August 24, 1904,\r\nthe upper chamber consists of princes of the reigning family, nobles\r\noccupying hereditary seats, members appointed for four years by the\r\ngrand-duke, and representatives of a variety of ecclesiastical,\r\neducational, and other corporate interests. The lower house is\r\ncomposed of seventy-three representatives elected for four years\r\n(twenty-four by the towns and forty-nine by the rural districts) by\r\nmale citizens over twenty-five years of age. Direct election was\r\nsubstituted for indirect in 1904. Half of the membership of the lower\r\nchamber is renewed every two years. In Baden there has been rather\r\nmore progress than in the majority of German states toward liberal and\r\nresponsible government.[414]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 414: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   345; K. Schenkel, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Grossherzogthums Baden (Freiburg and Tübingen,\r\n                   1884), in Marquardsen's Handbuch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE LESSER MONARCHIES AND THE CITY REPUBLICS\r\n\r\n*301. Monarchical Variations.*--With relatively unimportant exceptions,\r\nthe governments of the remaining seventeen German monarchies exhibit\r\nfeatures substantially similar to those of the governments that    (p. 280)\r\nhave been described. In each of the states, except the two\r\ngrand-duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, there\r\nis a written constitution, promulgated, in most instances, during the\r\nsecond or third quarter of the nineteenth century.[415] Executive\r\npower in each is vested in the monarch; legislative power in the\r\nmonarch and a Landtag, or assembly. The assembly consists ordinarily\r\nof a single chamber, varying in membership from twelve to forty-eight;\r\nand in most instances the members are chosen, at least in part, on a\r\nbasis of manhood suffrage. In some states, as the principality of\r\nLippe, the three-class electoral system prevails; and elections are\r\nstill very commonly indirect. The trend toward liberalism is, however,\r\nall but universal, and within recent years numbers of important\r\nchanges, e.g., the substitution of direct for indirect elections in\r\nOldenburg and in Saxe-Weimar in 1909, have been brought about. In the\r\ncuriously intertwined grand-duchies of Mecklenburg the common Landtag\r\nremains a typically mediæval assemblage of estates, based, in the\r\nmain, on the tenure of land.[416]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 415: The dates of the original\r\n                   promulgation of constitutions at present in\r\n                   operation are: Saxe-Weimar, 1816; Hesse, 1820;\r\n                   Saxe-Meiningen, 1829; Saxe-Altenburg, 1832;\r\n                   Brunswick, 1832; Lippe, 1836; Oldenburg, 1852;\r\n                   Waldeck, 1852; Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, 1852; Reuss\r\n                   Jüngerer Linie, 1852 and 1856;\r\n                   Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt, 1854;\r\n                   Schwartzburg-Sonderhausen, 1857; Anhalt, 1859;\r\n                   Reuss Älterer Linie, 1867; and Schaumburg-Lippe,\r\n                   1868.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 416: Repeated attempts to bring about a\r\n                   modernization of the Mecklenburg constitutional\r\n                   system have failed. Several times the liberal\r\n                   elements in the Reichstag have carried a proposal\r\n                   that to the Imperial constitution there should be\r\n                   added a clause requiring that in every state of the\r\n                   Empire there shall be an assembly representative of\r\n                   the whole people. On the ground that such an\r\n                   amendment would comprise an admission that the\r\n                   constitutions of the states are subject to revision\r\n                   at the hand of the Empire, the Bundesrath has\r\n                   invariably rejected the proposal. In 1907 the\r\n                   grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin inaugurated a\r\n                   movement for political reform, and in 1908 there\r\n                   was drafted a constitution providing for the\r\n                   establishment of a Landtag whose members should be\r\n                   chosen in part by the landed, industrial,\r\n                   professional, and official classes and in part by\r\n                   manhood suffrage. Late in 1909 the Ritterschaft\r\n                   (i.e., the estate comprising owners of knights'\r\n                   fees) rejected the proposal, as, indeed, it had\r\n                   rejected similar ones on earlier occasions.]\r\n\r\n*302. Hamburg.*--The three free cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck\r\nare survivals of the ancient Hanseatic League. All have republican\r\nforms of government, differing in only minor details. The constitution\r\nof Hamburg came into operation January 1, 1861, and was revised in\r\n1879 and in 1906. The principal organs of government are the Senate\r\nand the Bürgerschaft, or House of Burgesses. The Senate consists of\r\neighteen members elected for life by the House of Burgesses, but in\r\naccordance with an indirect method so devised that the Senate itself\r\nexercises a preponderating influence in the elections. A senator   (p. 281)\r\nis privileged to retire, if he so desires, at the end of a six-year\r\nperiod, or at the age of seventy. Of the eighteen, half must have\r\nstudied finance or law, while of the remaining nine at least seven\r\nmust belong to the class of merchants. The House of Burgesses is\r\ncomposed of 160 members, elected for six years by voters whose\r\nqualifications are based upon property, taxpaying, or position. An\r\nelectoral law of March 5, 1906, introduced the principle of\r\nproportional representation, but failed to break the dominance of the\r\nwell-to-do classes in the chamber. Half of the membership is renewed\r\ntriennially. The service is unpaid and, under ordinary circumstances,\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\nThe larger portion of the executive authority is vested in the Senate.\r\nAfter the fashion of the prince of a monarchical state, this body\r\nappoints officials, designates and instructs the delegate in the\r\nBundesrath, issues ordinances, and supervises administration.[417] One\r\nsenator is placed at the head of each of the nine executive\r\ndepartments. In matters of legislation the powers of the Senate and of\r\nthe Bürgerschaft are concurrent. Both bodies possess the right of\r\nlegislative initiative, and all laws, treaties, and fiscal\r\narrangements must receive the assent of both. The lower chamber elects\r\nand maintains a Bürgerausschuss, or Committee of the Burgesses,\r\nconsisting of twenty-five members, whose business it is to watch over\r\nthe proceedings of the Senate and the administration of the laws. The\r\nsessions of both Senate and Bürgerschaft are irregular but frequent.\r\n\r\n*303. Lübeck and Bremen.*--The government of Lübeck rests upon a\r\nconstitution proclaimed December 30, 1848, but revised in later years\r\nupon a number of occasions. The system is essentially similar to that\r\nin operation in Hamburg, the principal differences being that in\r\nLübeck the full membership of the Bürgerschaft (120) is elected by the\r\ncitizens directly and that the Bürgerausschuss, of thirty members,\r\nperforms larger and more independent functions. The constitution of\r\nBremen dates from March 5, 1849, but was revised in 1854, 1875, and\r\nthree times subsequently. As in Lübeck, the Bürgerschaft, of 150\r\nmembers, is elected by all of the citizens, but under a class system\r\naccording to which citizens who have studied at a university return\r\nfourteen members; the merchants, forty; the mechanics and\r\nmanufacturers, twenty; and all other citizens who have taken the\r\nburgher oath, the remaining seventy-six. The Senate consists of\r\nfourteen members.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 417: The presiding officer of the Senate\r\n                   is a burgomaster, chosen for one year by the\r\n                   senators from their own number. The burgomaster as\r\n                   such, however, possesses no administrative power.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ALSACE-LORRAINE                                               (p. 282)\r\n\r\n*304. Original Problem of Organization.*--By the terms of the Peace of\r\nFrankfort, May 10, 1871, France ceded to Germany the province of\r\nAlsace and a portion of that of Lorraine--an aggregate of 5,605 square\r\nmiles of hotly disputed territory whose population, while in\r\nconsiderable measure German, was none the less predominantly French.\r\nThe position assigned the newly acquired territory within the Empire\r\nwas anomalous. It was determined by two principal considerations:\r\nfirst, the fact that the districts comprised conquered territory\r\ninhabited by a discontented people and liable both to domestic\r\ndisorder and foreign invasion; and, second, the further fact that the\r\nnewly established Empire consisted of a federation of semi-autonomous\r\nstates, into which subordinate territory acquired by war could not\r\neasily be made to fit. The annexed lands might conceivably have been\r\nerected, in 1871, into the twenty-sixth state of the Empire; but in no\r\nquarter was this policy so much as suggested. They might have been\r\nincorporated with one of the existing states, or divided among two or\r\nmore of them; but this would have involved friction at a time when the\r\nstability of the new régime was not yet assured. The only course that\r\nto the statesmen and jurists of the day appeared feasible was to hold\r\nthe new territories as the joint property of the states, under the\r\nsovereign control of the Imperial Government; and the arrangement hit\r\nupon in the execution of this policy was perpetuated, with\r\nmodification only of administrative machinery, from 1871 until almost\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n*305. The Imperial Basis of Government.*--Prior to the enactment of the\r\ncontroverted Alsace-Lorraine Constitution Bill of 1911 Alsace-Lorraine\r\nwas not a member of the German federation, but was, on the contrary, a\r\nmere dependency--a Reichsland, or Imperial territory. Beginning with a\r\nvirtual dictatorship on the part of the Emperor, established under act\r\nof June 9, 1871, the governmental arrangements within the territory\r\npassed through a number of stages of elaboration. In the main, the\r\norgans of government employed until 1911, and a large proportion of\r\nthose still in operation, were created, or perpetuated, by the\r\nconstitutional statute of July 4, 1879. By this instrument the\r\nsovereignty of the territories was vested specifically in the Empire;\r\nthe exercise of that sovereignty was vested in the Kaiser, acting\r\nalone or in conjunction with the Bundesrath. The Kaiser was\r\nrepresented personally at Strassburg, as he still is, by a\r\nStatthalter, or governor-general, whose powers were such as the\r\nEmperor might from time to time intrust to him. At Strassburg      (p. 283)\r\nalso was a ministry, with a secretary of state at the head, and with\r\nunder-secretaries, appointed by the Kaiser, in charge of four\r\ndepartments; likewise a council of state, which was a purely advisory\r\nbody made up of the secretary and under-secretaries, certain judicial\r\nofficials, and from eight to twelve members specially appointed by the\r\nKaiser for a term of three years.\r\n\r\n*306. The Landesausschuss.*--Such privileges of self-government as were\r\npossessed by the inhabitants of the territory arose from the peculiar\r\nand complicated arrangements which were devised for legislation. In\r\n1874 an Imperial decree called into being a Landesausschuss, or\r\nTerritorial Committee. This body consisted originally of thirty\r\nmembers--ten elected in each of the three districts of Upper Alsace,\r\nLower Alsace, and Lorraine. Its function at the outset was merely to\r\ngive expert advice on subjects pertaining to local legislation and\r\ntaxation. By law of 1877, however, it was intrusted with power to\r\ninitiate legislation in matters pertaining solely to the territory.\r\nMeasures of any sort designed for Alsace-Lorraine exclusively were\r\nenabled to be carried through by enactment in the Territorial\r\nCommittee, provided they received the assent of the Bundesrath and\r\nwere duly promulgated by the Emperor. The Committee was enlarged until\r\nit consisted of fifty-eight members, thirty-four of whom were elected\r\nby the assemblies of the three districts from their own membership,\r\nfour others being chosen by the communal councils of Strassburg, Metz,\r\nKolmar, and Mülhausen, and twenty elected by indirect suffrage from\r\nthe twenty-three circles into which the territories were divided.\r\n\r\n*307. Legislative Processes.*--Several conditions, however, operated to\r\nimpose upon what might appear a fairly liberal system some very\r\nserious limitations. In the first place, there was no possibility of\r\nlegislation which was wholly within the control of the inhabitants of\r\nthe territory. The laws applicable solely to Prussia are made\r\nexclusively in Prussia, by Prussian authorities, and in like manner\r\nthose of every other one of the confederated states. But those of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, while they might be enacted in a provincial\r\nlegislative chamber, acquired no validity until they should have been\r\napproved by the Empire through its agents, the Bundesrath and the\r\nKaiser. In the second place, the method of legislation which has been\r\nmentioned did not occupy the field alone. With insignificant\r\nexceptions, any measure which might be enacted in the fashion\r\ndescribed might be enacted in either of two other ways, in neither of\r\nwhich did the inhabitants of the territory have any appreciable\r\ninfluence. A measure might take the form of a simple decree of     (p. 284)\r\nthe Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrath and Reichstag; or, in\r\nthe case of an ordinance having the provisory force of law, it might\r\nbe promulgated by the Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrath alone.\r\nThe fact that in practice the Territorial Committee ordinarily did\r\nparticipate in the legislative process was largely offset by the\r\nexceeding cumbersomeness and indirectness of the system. The normal\r\nprocedure in the making of a law for the territory involved at least\r\neight steps; (1) the _projet_ was drawn up by the Statthalter; (2) it\r\nwas approved by the Council of State at Strassburg; (3) it was\r\ntransmitted, through the Imperial Chancellor, to the Kaiser; (4) if he\r\napproved, it was sent to Strassburg to receive the Statthalter's\r\ncountersignature; (5) it was laid before the Bundesrath, the members\r\nof which, being but delegates, ascertained from their respective\r\nsovereigns how they should vote; (6) if all had gone well, the\r\nTerritorial Committee, at Strassburg, passed the measure through the\r\nusual three readings; (7) it was returned to the Bundesrath again to\r\nbe approved; and (8) it was promulgated by the Emperor--provided he\r\ndid not see fit to veto and withhold it, as he had an entire right to\r\ndo. Even if such roundabout law-making were to be considered in itself\r\nsatisfactory there remained the disquieting condition that the\r\nTerritorial Committee rested on no basis more substantial than a body\r\nof Imperial decrees capable at any time of being altered, or even\r\nrevoked. Not merely was it altogether lacking in the independence of\r\naction enjoyed by the diets of the federated states; its very\r\nexistence was precarious.\r\n\r\n*308. The Movement for Autonomy.*--Throughout a prolonged period there\r\nwas in the territory insistent demand for the grant of a more\r\nindependent status, to involve the eventual placing of Alsace-Lorraine\r\non a footing of constitutional equality with Saxony, Bavaria, and the\r\nother confederated states. Within very few years after the annexation\r\nthere sprang up, within the Territorial Committee first of all, a\r\ngroup of \"autonomists,\" led by the secretary of state Baron Zorn von\r\nBulach, who insisted in season and out upon statehood for the\r\nconquered territory, and within a decade the campaign gained momentum\r\nuntil it enlisted the support of men of all political faiths and\r\nbecame the principal rallying issue of Alsatian sentiment and\r\nenthusiasm. Until within recent years the tension of the international\r\nsituation was alone sufficient to restrain the Imperial Government\r\nfrom according the demand favorable consideration. With the passing of\r\ntime the danger of international conflict in which Alsace-Lorraine\r\nshould be involved was, however, perceptibly diminished, and the way\r\nwas to this extent cleared for a readjustment of the territory's\r\nanomalous status on the merits of the purely administrative and\r\nconstitutional questions involved.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the autonomists, as it finally assumed shape,     (p. 285)\r\nembraced four fundamental points: (1) the elevation of Alsace-Lorraine\r\nto membership in the German Empire, with all the rights and immunities\r\ncommonly possessed by existing members; (2) the vesting of the\r\nexecutive authority in an independent head of the state, whether a\r\nking of a newly established line, a regent appointed for life, or even\r\na president of a republic; (3) the establishment within the state of a\r\nfull-fledged legislative body, with powers equivalent to those\r\nexercised by the Landtags of the existing states; and (4) the\r\nelimination of Kaiser, Bundesrath, and Reichstag from all legislation\r\nwhich concerns Alsace-Lorraine exclusively. Taking their stand on the\r\nsituation as it was, and accepting the union with Germany with such\r\ngrace as they could muster and assuming that it is to be permanent,\r\nthe exponents of autonomy proposed to make the best of a state of\r\nthings not of their choosing.\r\n\r\n*309. The Government Bill of 1910.*--Under pressure of persistent public\r\ndemand, the Imperial Government prepared an elaborate measure upon the\r\nsubject, which, after having been approved by the Bundesrath, was\r\nsubmitted to the Reichstag, December 17, 1910. Although Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg had declared unreservedly for reform, the\r\nGovernment's proposals fell far short of the demands of the autonomist\r\nleaders. The cardinal features of the Imperial programme, were, in\r\nbrief: (1) Alsace-Lorraine should remain a dependency of the Empire;\r\n(2) sovereign authority therein should continue to be exercised by the\r\nKaiser, as the representative of the states, through his accustomed\r\nagent, the Statthalter at Strassburg; (3) the legislative functions of\r\nthe Bundesrath and Reichstag in matters pertaining exclusively to\r\nAlsace-Lorraine should be terminated; and (4) such legislation should\r\nthereafter be enacted by a bicameral diet at Strassburg. The members\r\nof the upper chamber of this diet, not to exceed thirty-six, were in\r\npart to sit by _ex-officio_ right, but some were to be named by\r\nchambers of commerce and other professional and business\r\norganizations, and a maximum of one-half might be appointed by the\r\nEmperor, on nomination of the Bundesrath. The sixty members of the\r\nlower house were to be chosen by manhood suffrage, but electors over\r\nthirty-five years of age were to have two votes, and those over\r\nforty-five three.\r\n\r\n*310. The Bill Amended and Adopted, 1911.*--By those whose object was\r\nthe procuring of statehood for Alsace-Lorraine, this plan was\r\npronounced inadmissible. It did not alter the legal status of the\r\nterritory; neither, it was alleged, did it give promise of increased\r\nlocal independence in law-making or administration. Conservatives, on\r\nthe other hand, objected to the provision which was made for manhood\r\nsuffrage. After being debated in the Reichstag the measure was     (p. 286)\r\nreferred to a special committee, by which amendments were reported\r\nto the effect that the territory should be created a state of the\r\nEmpire and the Statthalter should be appointed for life. The second of\r\nthese amendments the Government refused positively to accept, but it\r\nwas agreed finally that the territory should be recognized as\r\nsubstantially a state of the Empire, and, as such, should be allowed\r\nthree votes in the Bundesrath. Since 1879 the Statthalter had been\r\nauthorized to send to the Bundesrath four \"commissioners\" who might\r\nspeak when the subject under consideration touched the affairs of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, but might not vote. Since under the new arrangement\r\nthe three members representing Alsace-Lorraine were to be appointed\r\nand instructed by the Statthalter, who is himself practically the\r\ndelegate of the king of Prussia, the Bundesrath insisted upon and\r\nobtained the special stipulation (1) that the votes of Alsace-Lorraine\r\nshould not be counted in favor of the Prussian view of any question\r\nexcept when Prussia should be able to procure a majority without such\r\nvotes and (2) that they should not be counted for or against any\r\nproposal to amend the Imperial constitution. The revised bill was\r\npassed in the Reichstag, May 26, 1911, and in accordance with a decree\r\nof August 26 the new constitution was put in operation September 1.\r\n\r\n*311. The Governmental System To-day.*--Supreme executive authority is\r\nlodged, as before, in the Emperor. It is exercised, in the main, by\r\nthe Statthalter, who is appointed by, and holds office at the pleasure\r\nof, the Emperor. In the Statthalter are vested all the rights and\r\nprivileges in Alsace-Lorraine that hitherto have been held and\r\nexercised by the Imperial Chancellor. He appoints and instructs the\r\nplenipotentiaries in the Bundesrath, and Imperial orders and decrees\r\nhave legal effect only when signed by him. All laws require the assent\r\nof the Emperor and the two chambers of the diet, and the budget of the\r\nyear must be laid first before the lower chamber and must be accepted\r\nor rejected in its entirety by the upper one. The Emperor has the\r\nright to summon, to adjourn, and to dissolve the chambers\r\nsimultaneously. Members of the popular branch are elected by direct\r\nand secret ballot and majority vote by all male German citizens\r\ntwenty-five years of age who have resided in Alsace-Lorraine at least\r\nthree years; except that a residence of one year qualifies teachers\r\nand occupants of official posts. The plural voting proposal contained\r\nin the Government bill of 1910 was abandoned. The first chamber\r\nelected under the new system--that chosen in October, 1911--contained\r\ntwenty-five Centre members, eleven Socialists, ten members of the\r\nNational Alsace-Lorraine group,[418] eight Liberal Democrats, and  (p. 287)\r\nsix Independents. The independent attitude promptly assumed by the\r\nbody elicited from the Emperor, in May, 1912, a threat that the new\r\nconstitution might be abrogated and Alsace-Lorraine incorporated with\r\nPrussia. The incident provoked a storm of criticism, and, outside the\r\nrabid Pan-German press, the Imperial pronouncement was commented upon\r\neverywhere adversely.[419]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 418: The party which had contended most\r\n                   vigorously for Alsatian autonomy.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 419: On the organization of\r\n                   Alsace-Lorraine prior to 1911 see Howard, The\r\n                   German Empire, Chap. 10; Laband, Das Staatsrecht\r\n                   des deutschen Reiches, §§ 67-69; P.

A CENTURY OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY\r\n\r\nAmong European states of the first order there is but a single\r\nrepublic. In Great Britain the conspicuous success with which monarchy\r\nhas been tempered with democracy has left the partisans of the\r\nrepublican style of government slender ground upon which to stand.\r\nRussia has as yet but partially emerged from a political status in\r\nwhich monarchy is both natural and inevitable. Germany and Italy, in\r\ndays comparatively recent, achieved nationality through processes\r\nabsolutely conditioned upon monarchical leadership. And it is all but\r\ninconceivable that the heterogeneous nationalities of Austria-Hungary\r\nshould thus long have been held together by any force less tangible\r\nand commanding than the personality of a common sovereign. Although in\r\nsome of these instances the functions ordinarily associated with\r\nmonarchy are more nominal than actual, the fact remains that in no one\r\nof the greater European states, save France, has it as yet been found\r\nexpedient, or possible, to dispense with royalty as an agency of\r\npublic authority.\r\n\r\n*312. The Multiplicity of Constitutions.*--The chain of circumstances by\r\nwhich the people of France have been brought to their present\r\nrepublican form of government constitutes one of the most remarkable\r\nchapters in the history of modern Europe. After centuries of\r\ngovernmental centralization, under conditions which enabled monarchy\r\nto do its best, and its worst, there came the gigantic disruption of\r\n1789, inaugurating a series of constitutional changes by which was\r\nimparted to the political history of the French nation in the\r\nnineteenth century a more unsettled character than that exhibited by\r\nthe public economy of any other European state. France to-day is\r\ngoverned under her eleventh constitution since the fall of the\r\nBastille. All but one of the eleven have been actually in operation,\r\nduring a longer or a shorter period. But, prior to the fundamental law\r\nat present in effect, no one of these instruments attained its\r\ntwentieth year. Once having cut loose from her ancient moorings, the\r\nnation became through many decades the plaything of every current  (p. 290)\r\nthat swept the political sea. It is only within our own generation\r\nthat she appears definitely to have righted herself for a prolonged\r\nand steady voyage. The constitutional system of the Third Republic is\r\na product, not of orderly evolution, but of disruption,\r\nexperimentation, compromise. It represents a precarious balance which\r\nhas been struck between those forces of radicalism and conservatism,\r\nof progress and reaction, for whose eternal conflict France\r\npre-eminently has furnished a theatre since 1789. Its connection with\r\nthe remoter past is very much less direct and fundamental than is that\r\nof the governmental system of England, Russia, Austria-Hungary, or the\r\nScandinavian states. At certain points, however, as will appear, this\r\nconnection is vital. And the relation of the constitution of 1871-1875\r\nto the several instruments by which it was more immediately preceded\r\nis essential to be observed, because this body of fundamental law\r\ncomprises but the latest in a series of devices through which France\r\nsince 1789 has sought orderliness and stability in public affairs.\r\nSome of these devices were shaped under the preponderating influence\r\nof radical democracy, some under that of monarchical reaction; but all\r\nare of interest and importance. For the purpose in hand it will be\r\nsufficient to review briefly the principal aspects of the several\r\nconstitutional systems whose devising or operation has contributed\r\nwith some directness to the political institutions and experience of\r\nthe France of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE REVOLUTIONARY AND NAPOLEONIC ERA\r\n\r\n*313. The Constitution of 1791.*--During the decade which elapsed\r\nbetween the outbreak of the Revolution and the establishment of the\r\nConsulate there were in actual operation in France two successive\r\nconstitutions: that of September 3, 1791, which was in effect\r\nsubverted by the uprising of August 10, 1792, and that of 5 Fructidor\r\nof the Year III. (August 22, 1795), terminated by the _coup d'état_ of\r\n18 Brumaire of the Year VIII. (November 9, 1799). The instrument of\r\n1791, essentially a compilation of measures voted during the years\r\n1789-1791, was prepared by a committee appointed by the National\r\nAssembly, September 15, 1789.[420] It was shaped, in the main, by men\r\nwho were desirous of preserving the form while destroying the\r\nsubstance of monarchy. At the head of the state was allowed to remain\r\nthe king, shorn, however, of many of his accustomed prerogatives and\r\nobliged to exercise under stringent restraint the few that were left\r\nhim. \"King of the French,\" he henceforth was to be, \"by the grace of\r\nGod and the will of the nation.\" The legislative body (_Corps      (p. 291)\r\nlégislatif_) was made to consist of a single chamber whose 745\r\nmembers, chosen for a two-year term according to a system of indirect\r\nsuffrage, were distributed among the eighty-three newly created\r\ndepartments upon the three-fold basis of extent, population, and\r\ncontribution of direct taxes.[421] Only male citizens who had attained\r\nthe age of twenty-five, and whose annual payment of direct taxes was\r\nthe equivalent of three days' labor, were entitled to participate in\r\nthe choice of the electors, by whom, in turn, were chosen the\r\ndeputies. The powers of the legislative body were ample. In respect to\r\nmeasures generally, the king possessed only a suspensive veto; that is\r\nto say, any measure passed by three successive legislatures acquired,\r\nwithout the royal sanction, the force of law. Fiscal measures might\r\nnot be vetoed at all. The king was given no power to prorogue or to\r\ndissolve the legislative chamber, and without the assent of that body\r\nno proclamation of war, and no treaty, was valid. To it the ministers\r\nin charge of the six executive departments were made absolutely\r\nresponsible. In conformity with prevailing ideas of the sovereignty of\r\nthe people and the separation of powers, provision was made that all\r\njudges should be elected popularly, as also all local administrative\r\nauthorities.[422]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 420: A constitutional committee of five\r\n                   had been appointed the previous July 14; but, its\r\n                   recommendation proving unacceptable to the\r\n                   Assembly, it had resigned, September 11.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 421: Of the whole number of deputies, 247\r\n                   were apportioned according to departmental areas\r\n                   and 249 according each to population and tax\r\n                   quotas.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 422: The texts of all French\r\n                   constitutions and fundamental laws since 1789 are\r\n                   printed in several collections, of which the best\r\n                   is L.

The Constitution of the Year I. (1793).*--The constitution of 1791\r\nwas in operation rather less than a twelvemonth. The _Corps\r\nlégislatif_ elected under it, after precipitating war with Austria,\r\ngave way before the rising demand for the abolition of monarchy,\r\ncalled into being a constituent convention of 782 members, and voted\r\nits own dissolution.[423] September 21, 1792, the Convention met and\r\ndecreed the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a\r\nrepublic.[424] Mindful for the time of the purpose of its          (p. 292)\r\ncreation, the new assembly appointed, October 11, a committee of nine\r\nto which was intrusted the task of drafting a republican constitution.\r\nFebruary 15, 1793, the committee reported, and June 24 the Convention\r\nadopted an ultra-republican frame of government, the principal\r\nfeatures of which were an executive council consisting of twenty-four\r\nmembers chosen by the legislative body from candidates named by the\r\nsecondary electors of the departments; a unicameral _Corps législatif_\r\nchosen indirectly by manhood suffrage for one year, with power to\r\nenact \"decrees,\" but only to propose \"laws\"; and an arrangement\r\nwhereby projected laws were to be communicated to primary assemblies\r\nof citizens to be voted upon after the principle of the\r\nreferendum.[425]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 423: The members of the Convention were\r\n                   elected by manhood suffrage, one of the last acts\r\n                   of the Legislative Body having been the repeal of\r\n                   the tax qualification required by the constitution\r\n                   of 1791.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 424: September 22 was reckoned the first\r\n                   day of the Year I. of French liberty, and the\r\n                   fundamental law of June 24, 1793, was known as the\r\n                   constitution of the Year I.

(1795).*--By reason of the\r\nintensity of party strife within the Convention, and the critical\r\ncondition of affairs generally, the constitution of 1793, although\r\nduly ratified by the people, was never put in operation. On the basis\r\nof a decree of December 4, 1793, the Convention maintained through\r\nupwards of two years a revolutionary provisional government, and when,\r\nfinally, in October, 1795, the body passed out of existence, it left\r\nbehind it in the Constitution of the Year III. an instrument of\r\ngovernment essentially different from the proposed instrument of 1793.\r\nThe Constitution of the Year III. was framed under a hurried order of\r\nthe Convention by a committee of eleven. The Convention adopted the\r\ncommittee's plan with but few modifications, and when the project was\r\nsubmitted to a popular vote it was approved by the overwhelming\r\nmajority of 1,057,390 to 49,997. September 23, 1795, the new frame of\r\ngovernment was solemnly promulgated.\r\n\r\nThe instrument of 1795, like that of 1791, was introduced by a\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, in which were\r\nstated succinctly the fundamental principles of the Revolution.\r\nLegislative power was henceforth to be vested in two chambers\r\nconjointly--a Council of Five Hundred and a Council of Elders--the\r\nmembers of which should be chosen by the same electors, but under\r\ndiffering conditions of eligibility. The term of members of both\r\nchambers was fixed at three years, and one-third of the membership was\r\nrenewable annually. The franchise was broader than under the       (p. 293)\r\nconstitution of 1791, being extended now to all citizens over\r\ntwenty-one years of age who were able to read and write and who\r\nfollowed a trade or were liable to direct taxation; but the earlier\r\nsystem of indirect election by means of electoral colleges was\r\nretained. Upon the lower chamber alone was conferred the right of\r\ninitiating legislation. The Elders, whose number was fixed at 250,\r\nmight approve or reject, but were not permitted to amend, any measure\r\nsubmitted to them. Executive power was vested in a Directory\r\nconsisting of five members chosen for a term of five years, one member\r\nretiring annually. Directors were selected by the Council of Elders\r\nfrom a double quota of nominees offered by the Council of Five\r\nHundred. Aside from its creation of a plural, republican executive,\r\nthe most notable feature of the constitution was its provision for the\r\nestablishment of a bicameral legislative system, until now generally\r\nopposed by French reformers.[426]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 426: For the text of the constitution of\r\n                   1795 see Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   78-118; Hélie, Les Constitutions, 436-466;\r\n                   Anderson, Constitutions, 212-254.

The Constitution of the Year VIII. (1799): Electoral System.*--The\r\nconstitution of the Year III. continued in operation from October,\r\n1795, to Napoleon's _coup d'état_ of 18 Brumaire of the Year VIII.\r\n(November 9, 1799). In the course of a month and a half following the\r\nevent mentioned there was drawn up a new fundamental law, prepared in\r\nthe first instance largely by Napoleon and Sieyès, put into final\r\nshape by two commissions composed each of twenty-five members of the\r\nold Councils, and subsequently ratified by popular vote.[427] Amended\r\nfrom time to time by important organic enactments, the Constitution of\r\nthe Year VIII. (December 13, 1799) comprised the fundamental law under\r\nwhich Napoleon ruled France until his abdication in 1814.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 427: In favor of the new constitution\r\n                   there were cast 3,011,007 votes; against it,\r\n                   1,562.]\r\n\r\nThe new instrument, in ninety-five articles, was much briefer than the\r\none which it replaced,[428] but the scheme of government for which it\r\nmade provision was distinctly more complicated than that previously in\r\noperation. In the main, the Napoleonic constitution dealt with three\r\nsubjects: the electoral system, the assemblies, and the executive.\r\nNominally there was established a system of thoroughgoing manhood  (p. 294)\r\nsuffrage. But the conditions under which electoral powers were to be\r\nexercised rendered the plan very much less democratic than on the\r\nsurface it appeared to be. The scheme was one devised by Sieyès under\r\nthe designation of \"lists of notables.\" In each communal district\r\ncitizens twenty-one years of age and inscribed on the civil register\r\nwere authorized to choose one-tenth of their number to comprise a\r\n\"communal list.\" Those named on the communal list were to choose in\r\ntheir department a tenth of their number, who formed a \"departmental\r\nlist.\" And, similarly, those whose names appeared on the departmental\r\nlist were to choose a tenth of their number, who formed a \"national\r\nlist.\" From these three lists in order were to be chosen, largely by\r\nthe Senate, the public officials of the districts, the departments,\r\nand the nation. No electoral scheme has ever been devised which, while\r\ngrounded upon the principle of manhood suffrage, more effectually\r\nwithdraws from the people the actual choice of public officials, local\r\nas well as national.[429]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 428: The constitution of the Year III.,\r\n                   containing 377 articles, is one of the lengthiest\r\n                   documents of the sort on record.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 429: Under this system the primary\r\n                   electors numbered about 5,000,000; the district\r\n                   notables, 500,000; the departmental notables,\r\n                   50,000; and the national list, 5,000.]\r\n\r\n*317. Constitution of the Year VIII: Organs of Government.*--Of national\r\ngovernmental bodies there were four. One was the Tribunate, consisting\r\nof 100 members, one-fifth of whom were renewable every year. The\r\nfunction of the Tribunate was to discuss, but not necessarily to vote\r\nupon, legislative measures. A second was the _Corps législatif_, or\r\nLegislative Body, of 300 members, one-fifth being renewed annually. To\r\nthis assembly was committed the power to vote upon, but not to debate,\r\nlegislative measures. A third was the Senate, consisting at the outset\r\nof sixty life members, to be increased through a period of ten years\r\nto eighty. The Senate was authorized to pass upon the constitutionality\r\nof laws and to choose the Tribunes, the Legislators, and the Consuls\r\nfrom the national list. Its own ranks were to be recruited by\r\nco-optation from triple lists of candidates presented by the\r\nTribunate, the Legislative Body, and the First Consul. Finally, there\r\nwas the Council of State, whose organization was left purposely\r\nindefinite. Its members were appointed by the First Consul, and their\r\nbusiness consisted principally in the preparation and advocacy of\r\nlegislative and administrative measures.\r\n\r\nIf under this scheme the legislative organs were weak, the executive\r\nauthority was notably strong. Powers of an executive character were\r\nvested in three consuls, appointed by the Senate for ten years and\r\nindefinitely eligible. Upon the First Consul was conferred power to\r\npromulgate the laws, to appoint all civil and military officials, and\r\nto do many other things of vital importance. Upon the second and   (p. 295)\r\nthird consuls was bestowed simply a \"consultative voice.\" Provision\r\nwas made for a ministry, and under the letter of the constitution no\r\nact of the government was binding unless performed on the warrant of a\r\nminister. But in point of fact the principle of irresponsibility\r\npermeated the Napoleonic régime from the First Consul himself to the\r\nlowliest functionary. The conferring upon Napoleon, in 1802, of the\r\nconsulship for life, and the conversion of the Consulate, in 1804,\r\ninto the Empire, but concentrated yet more fully in the hands of a\r\nsingle man the whole body of governmental authority in France.[430]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 430: The text of the constitution of the\r\n                   Year VIII. is in Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 118-129; Hélie, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   577-585; and Anderson, Constitutions, 270-281.\r\n                   Summary in Block, Dictionnaire Général, I.,\r\n                   500-505. Cambridge Modern History, IX., Chap. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. FROM THE RESTORATION TO THE REVOLUTION OF 1848\r\n\r\n*318. The Constitutional Charter, 1814.*--May 3, 1814,--three weeks\r\nafter Napoleon's signature of the Act of Abdication,--the restored\r\nBourbon king, Louis XVIII., entered Paris. Already the Senate had\r\nformulated a document, commonly known as the \"Senatorial\r\nConstitution,\" wherein was embraced a scheme for a liberalized Bourbon\r\nmonarchy.[431] Neither the instrument itself nor the authorship of it\r\nwas acceptable to the new sovereign, and by him the task of drafting a\r\nconstitution was given over to a commission consisting of three\r\nrepresentatives of the crown, nine senators, and nine members of the\r\nLegislative Body. The task was accomplished with despatch. June 4 the\r\nnew instrument, under the name of the Constitutional Charter, was\r\nadopted by the two chambers, and ten days later it was put in\r\noperation. With some modification, principally in 1830, it remained\r\nthe fundamental law of France until the revolution of 1848.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 431: Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 179-182; Anderson, Constitutions,\r\n                   446-450; Block, Dictionnaire Général, I., 505-506.]\r\n\r\nThe governmental system provided for in the Charter was in a number of\r\nrespects more liberal than that which had prevailed during the\r\ndominance of Napoleon. At the head of the state stood the king,\r\ninviolable in person, in whose hands were gathered the powers of\r\nissuing ordinances, making appointments, declaring war, concluding\r\ntreaties, commanding the armies, and initiating all measures of\r\nlegislation. But there was established a bicameral legislature, by\r\nwhich the king's ministers might be impeached, and without whose\r\nassent no law might be enacted and no tax levied. The upper house, or\r\nChamber of Peers, was composed of a variable number of members named\r\nby the crown in heredity or for life.[432] The lower, or Chamber   (p. 296)\r\nof Deputies, consisted of representatives elected in the departments\r\nfor a term of five years, one-fifth retiring annually.[433] Provision\r\nwas made for the annual assembling of the chambers; and although the\r\nproposing of laws was vested exclusively in the crown, it was\r\nstipulated that either house might petition the king to introduce a\r\nmeasure relating to any specific subject. The Charter contained a\r\ncomprehensive enumeration and guarantee of the civil rights of French\r\ncitizens.[434]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 432: By law of December 29, 1831, it was\r\n                   stipulated that only life peers might thereafter be\r\n                   appointed, and the king was required to take all\r\n                   appointees from a prescribed list of dignitaries.\r\n                   Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions, 231-232.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 433: A law of June 9, 1824, stipulated\r\n                   that thereafter the Chamber of Deputies should be\r\n                   elected integrally for a period of seven years.\r\n                   Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions, 211.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 434: The text of the Charter of 1814 may\r\n                   be found in Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 183-190; Hélie, Les Constitutions, 884-890;\r\n                   and, in English translation, in Anderson,\r\n                   Constitutions, 457-465, and University of\r\n                   Pennsylvania Translations and Reprints, I., No. 3.\r\n                   Summary in Block, Dictionnaire Général, I.,\r\n                   506-508. Cambridge Modern History, IX., Chap. 18.]\r\n\r\n*319. The Electoral System.*--The Charter prescribed the\r\nqualifications required of voters and of deputies, but did not define\r\nthe manner in which deputies should be chosen. The lack was supplied\r\nby an election law enacted February 5, 1817. The system established\r\nwas that of _scrutin de liste_. Under it the electors--men of a\r\nminimum age of thirty who paid each year a direct tax of at least\r\nthree hundred francs--were required to assemble in the principal town\r\nof the department and there choose the full quota of deputies to which\r\nthe department was entitled. The system proved of distinct advantage\r\nto the liberal elements, whose strength lay largely in the towns, and\r\nin 1820 when the conservative forces procured control and inaugurated\r\na general reaction a measure was adopted, though only after heated\r\ndebate, by which the arrangement was completely altered. The\r\nmembership of the Chamber was increased from 258 to 430 and for the\r\nprinciple of _scrutin de liste_ was substituted that of _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_. Each arrondissement became a single-member district\r\nand the electors were permitted to vote for one deputy only. In this\r\nmanner 258 of the members were chosen. The remaining 172 were elected\r\nat the chief departmental towns by the voters of the department who\r\npaid the most taxes, an arrangement under which some twelve thousand\r\nof the wealthier electors became possessed of a double vote. Voting\r\nwas by ballot, but the elector was required to write out his ballot in\r\nthe presence of an appointee of the government and to place it in his\r\nhands unfolded.[435]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 435: Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 206-209; Hélie, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   934-936.]\r\n\r\n*320. Liberalizing Changes in 1830-1831.*--Upon the enforced       (p. 297)\r\nabdication of Charles X. in 1830 a parliamentary commission prepared a\r\nrevision of the Charter, which, being adopted, was imposed upon the\r\nnew sovereign, Louis Philippe, and was continued in operation through\r\nthe period of the Orleanist monarchy. The preamble of the original\r\ndocument, in which language had been employed which made it appear\r\nthat the Charter was a grant from the crown, was stricken out.\r\nSuspension of the laws by the sovereign was expressly forbidden. Each\r\nchamber was given the right to initiate legislation, the\r\nresponsibility of the ministers to the chambers was proclaimed, and\r\nthe sessions of the Peers, hitherto secret, were made public. The\r\nintegral renewal of the Deputies, established in 1824, was continued,\r\nbut the term of membership was restored to five years. The minimum age\r\nof electors was reduced from thirty to twenty-five years, and of\r\ndeputies from forty to thirty. Subsequently, April 19, 1831, a law was\r\npassed whereby the suffrage--so restricted at the close of the\r\nNapoleonic régime that in a population of 29,000,000 there had been,\r\nin 1814, not 100,000 voters--was appreciably broadened. The direct tax\r\nqualification of three hundred francs was reduced to one of two\r\nhundred, and, for certain professional classes, of one hundred. By\r\nthis modification the number of voters was doubled, though the\r\nproportion of the enfranchised was still but one in one hundred fifty\r\nof the total population, and it would be a mistake to regard the\r\ngovernment of the Orleanist period as in effect more democratic than\r\nthat by which it was preceded. At the most, it was a government by and\r\nfor the well-to-do middle class.[436]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 436: For the act of the Chambers relative\r\n                   to the modification of the Constitutional Charter\r\n                   and to the accession of Louis Philippe, see Duguit\r\n                   et Monnier, Les Constitutions, 213-218; Hélie, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 987-992; and Anderson,\r\n                   Constitutions, 507-513.

THE SECOND REPUBLIC AND THE SECOND EMPIRE\r\n\r\n*321. The Republican Constitution of 1848.*--With the overthrow of the\r\nOrleanist monarchy, in consequence of the uprising of February 24,\r\n1848, France entered upon a period of aggravated political\r\nunsettlement. Through upwards of five years the nation experimented\r\nonce more with republicanism, only at the end of that period to emerge\r\na monarchy, an empire, and the dominion of a Bonaparte. By the\r\nprovisional government which sprang from the revolution a republic was\r\nproclaimed tentatively and the nation was called upon to elect, under\r\na system of direct manhood suffrage, an assembly to frame a constitution.\r\nThe elections--the first of their kind in the history of           (p. 298)\r\nFrance--were held April 23, 1848, and the National Constituent\r\nAssembly, consisting of nine hundred members, eight hundred of whom\r\nwere moderate republicans, met May 4 in Paris. During the summer the\r\ndraft of a constitution prepared by a committee of eighteen, was duly\r\ndebated, and November 4 it was adopted by a vote of 739 to 30.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1848 declared the Republic to be perpetual and the\r\npeople to be sovereign. It asserted, furthermore, that the separation\r\nof powers is the first condition of a free government. In respect to\r\nthe organs of government it provided, in the first place, for a\r\nlegislative assembly consisting of a single chamber of 750\r\nmembers[437] chosen integrally for three years, directly by secret\r\nballot on the principle of departmental _scrutin de liste_, and by\r\nelectors whose only necessary qualifications were those of age\r\n(twenty-one years) and of non-impairment of civil rights.[438]\r\nExecutive powers were vested in a president of the Republic, elected\r\nfor a term of four years by direct and secret ballot, and by absolute\r\nmajority of all votes cast in France and Algeria. Under stipulated\r\nconditions, e.g., if no candidate should receive an absolute majority\r\nand at the same time a total of at least two million votes, the\r\npresident was required to be chosen by the Assembly from the five\r\ncandidates who had polled the largest votes. Save after a four-year\r\ninterval, the president was ineligible for re-election. Upon him were\r\nbestowed large powers, including those of proposing laws, negotiating\r\nand ratifying treaties with the consent of the Assembly, appointing\r\nand dismissing ministers and other civil and military officers, and\r\ndisposing of the armed forces. With respect to the functions and\r\npowers of the ministers the constitution was not explicit, and whether\r\nthe instrument might legitimately be interpreted to make provision for\r\na parliamentary system of government was one of the standing issues\r\nthroughout the days of its duration.[439]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 437: Including representatives of Algeria\r\n                   and the colonies.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 438: Electoral law of March 15, 1849.\r\n                   Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions, 247-265.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 439: Dupriez, Les Ministres, II.,\r\n                   308-312.

From Republic to Empire.*--December 10, 1848, Louis Napoleon,\r\nnephew of the first Napoleon, was chosen president by an overwhelming\r\nvote, and ten days later he assumed office. In May, 1849, an       (p. 299)\r\nAssembly was elected, two-thirds of whose members were thoroughgoing\r\nmonarchists; so that, as one writer has put it, both the president and\r\nthe majority of the Assembly were, by reason of their very being,\r\nenemies of the constitution under which they had been elected.[440]\r\nThe new order, furthermore, failed completely to strike root\r\nthroughout the nation at large. In this state of things the collapse\r\nof the Republic was but a question of time. By an electoral law of May\r\n31, 1850, requiring of the elector a fixed residence of three years\r\ninstead of six months, the suffrage arrangements of 1849 were\r\nsubverted and the electorate was reduced by three millions, or\r\nvirtually one-third.[441] December 2, 1851, occurred a carefully\r\nplanned _coup d'état_, on which occasion the Assembly was dissolved,\r\nthe franchise law of 1849 was restored, and the people, gathered in\r\nprimary assemblies, were called upon to intrust to the President power\r\nto revise the national constitution.[442] December 20, by a vote of\r\n7,439,216 to 640,737, the people complied. Thereafter, though\r\ncontinuing officially through another year, the Republic was in\r\nreality dead. November 7, 1852, the veil was thrown off. A\r\n_senatus-consulte_ decreed a re-establishment of the Empire,[443] and\r\nby a plebiscite of eleven days later the people, by a vote of\r\n7,824,189 to 253,145, sanctioned what had been done. December 2,\r\nNapoleon III. was proclaimed Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 440: Hazen, Europe since 1815, 201.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 441: The text of this measure is in\r\n                   Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions, 265-268, and\r\n                   Hélie, Les Constitutions, 1149-1150.

The Imperial Constitution, 1852.*--Meanwhile, March 29, 1852,\r\nthere had been put in operation a constitution,[444] nominally\r\nrepublican, but in reality strongly resembling that in force during\r\nthe later years of Napoleon I. The substitution, later in the year, of\r\nan emperor for a president upon whom had been conferred a ten-year\r\nterm was but a matter of detail. A _senatus-consulte_ of December 25,\r\nmade all of the necessary adjustments, and the constitution of 1852,\r\nwith occasional modifications, remained the fundamental law of France\r\nuntil the collapse of the Empire in 1870. Upon the emperor were\r\nconferred very extended powers. His control of the administrative\r\nsystem was made practically absolute. He commanded the army and navy,\r\ndecided upon war and peace, concluded treaties, and granted pardons.\r\nHe alone possessed the power of initiating legislation and of promulgating\r\nthe laws. To him alone were all ministers responsible, and of      (p. 300)\r\nsuch parliamentarism as had existed formerly there remained not a\r\nvestige, Of legislative chambers there were two: a _Corps législatif_\r\nof 251 members elected by direct manhood suffrage every six years, and\r\na Senate composed of cardinals, admirals, and other _ex-officio_\r\nmembers, and of a variable number of members appointed for life by the\r\nemperor. The powers of the Senate, exercised invariably in close\r\nconjunction with the head of the state, were of some importance, but\r\nthose of the popular chamber were so restricted that the liberal\r\narrangements which existed respecting the suffrage afforded but the\r\nappearance, not the reality, of democracy.[445]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 444: Drawn up by a commission of five,\r\n                   under date of January 14, 1852.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 445: The text of the constitution of 1852\r\n                   is in Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   274-280; Hélie, Les Constitutions, 1167-1171;\r\n                   Anderson, Constitutions, 543-549.

Constitutional Alterations, 1869-1870.*--Throughout upwards of\r\ntwo decades the illusion of popular government was maintained as well\r\nas might be. The country was prosperous and the government, if\r\nilliberal, was on the whole enlightened. Discontent, none the less,\r\nwas not infrequently in evidence, and during especially the second\r\nhalf of the reign the Emperor found it expedient more than once to\r\nmake some concession to public sentiment. In the later sixties he was\r\ncompelled to moderate the laws which dealt with the press and with\r\npolitical meetings, and in 1869-1870 he was brought to the point of\r\napproving a series of measures which gave promise of altering in an\r\nimportant manner the entire governmental system. One was a\r\n_senatus-consulte_ of September 8, 1869, whereby the sittings of the\r\nSenate were made public, the Legislative Body was given the right to\r\nelect all of its own officials, and the parliamentary system was\r\nnominally re-established.[446] By reason of the fact, however, that\r\nministers were not permitted to be members of either the Legislative\r\nBody or the Senate, and that they were declared still to be\r\nresponsible to the crown, the effects of the last-mentioned feature of\r\nthe reform were inconsiderable. By a _senatus-consulte_ of April 20,\r\n1870, (approved by a plebiscite of May 8 following) there were adopted\r\nstill more important constitutional changes. In the first place, the\r\nSenate, which hitherto had been virtually an Imperial council, was\r\nerected into a legislative chamber co-ordinate with the Legislative\r\nBody, and upon both houses was conferred the right of initiating\r\nlegislation. In the second place, the provision that the ministers\r\nshould be dependent solely upon the emperor was stricken from the\r\nconstitution, thus clearing the way for a more effective realization\r\nof the parliamentary system of government. Finally, it was         (p. 301)\r\nstipulated that the constitution should thereafter be modified only\r\nwith the express approval of the people.[447] These reforms, however,\r\nwere belated. They came only after the popularity of the Emperor had\r\nbeen strained to the breaking point, and by reason of the almost\r\nimmediate coming on of the war with Prussia there was scant\r\nopportunity for the testing of their efficacy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 446: Text in Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 307-308; Hélie, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   1314-1315; and Anderson, Constitutions, 579-580.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 447: The text of the measure of April 20,\r\n                   1870, is in Duguit et Monnier, Les Constitutions,\r\n                   308-314; Hélie, Les Constitutions, 1315-1327; and\r\n                   Anderson, Constitutions, 581-586.

The National Assembly.*--The present French Republic was\r\ninstituted under circumstances which gave promise of even less\r\nstability than had been exhibited by its predecessors of 1793 and\r\n1848.[448] Proclaimed in the dismal days following the disaster at\r\nSedan, it owed its existence, at the outset, to the fact that, with\r\nthe capture of Napoleon III. by the Prussians and the utter collapse\r\nof the Empire, there had arisen, as Thiers put it, \"a vacancy of\r\npower.\" The proclamation was issued September 4, 1870, when the war\r\nwith Prussia had been in progress but seven weeks.[449] During the\r\nremaining five months of the contest the sovereign authority of France\r\nwas exercised by a Provisional Government of National Defense, with\r\nGeneral Trochu at its head, devised in haste to meet the emergency by\r\nGambetta, Favre, Ferry, and other former members of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. Upon the capitulation of Paris, January 28, 1871, elections\r\nwere ordered for a national assembly, the function of which was to\r\ndecide whether the war should be prolonged and what terms of peace\r\nshould be accepted at the hands of the victorious Germans. There was\r\nno time in which to frame a new electoral system. Consequently the\r\nelectoral procedure of the Second Republic, as prescribed by the   (p. 302)\r\nlaw of March 15, 1849, was revived,[450] and by manhood suffrage\r\nthere was chosen, February 8, an assembly of 758 members,\r\nrepresentative of both France and the colonies. Meeting at Bordeaux,\r\nFebruary 12, this body, by unanimous vote, conferred upon the\r\nhistorian and parliamentarian Thiers the title of \"Chief of the\r\nExecutive Power,\" without fixed term, voted almost solidly for a\r\ncessation of hostilities, and authorized Thiers to proceed with an\r\nimmediate negotiation of peace.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 448: The best account of the beginnings\r\n                   of the Third Republic is that in G.

The Problem of a Permanent Government.*--Pending a diplomatic\r\nadjustment, the Assembly was disposed to defer the establishment of a\r\npermanent governmental system. But the problem could not long be kept\r\nin the background. There were several possible solutions. A party of\r\nLegitimists, i.e., adherents of the old Bourbon monarchy, was\r\nresolved upon the establishment of a kingdom under the Count of\r\nChambord, grandson of the Charles X. who had been deposed at the\r\nrevolution of 1830. Similarly, a party of Orleanists was insistent\r\nupon a restoration of the house of Orleans, overthrown in 1848, in the\r\nperson of the Count of Paris, a grandson of the citizen-king Louis\r\nPhilippe. A smaller group of those who, despite the discredit which\r\nthe house of Bonaparte had suffered in the war, remained loyal to the\r\nNapoleonic tradition, was committed to a revival of the prostrate\r\nempire of the captive Napoleon III. Finally, in Paris and some\r\nportions of the outlying country there was uncompromising demand for\r\nthe definite establishment of a republic.[451] In the Assembly the\r\nmonarchists outnumbered the republicans five to two, and, although the\r\nmembers had been chosen primarily for their opinions relative to peace\r\nrather than to constitutional forms, the proportion throughout the\r\nnation was probably about the same. The republican outlook, however,\r\nwas vastly improved by the fact that the monarchists, having nothing\r\nin common save opposition to republicanism, were hopelessly disagreed\r\namong themselves.[452]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 451: G. Weill, Histoire du parti\r\n                   républicain en France de 1814 à 1870 (Paris,\r\n                   1900).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 452: Of pure Legitimists there were in\r\n                   the Assembly about 150; of Bonapartists, not over\r\n                   30; of Republicans, about 250. The remaining\r\n                   members were Orleanists or men of indecisive\r\n                   inclination. At no time was the full membership of\r\n                   the Assembly in attendance.]\r\n\r\n*327. The Rivet Law, 1871.*--As, from the drift of its proceedings, the\r\nroyalist character of the Assembly began to stand out in unmistakable\r\nrelief, there arose from republican quarters vigorous opposition to\r\nthe prolonged existence of the body. Even before the signing of the\r\nPeace of Frankfort, May 10, 1871, there occurred a clash between the\r\nAssembly and the radical Parisian populace, the upshot of which    (p. 303)\r\nwas the bloody war of the Commune of April-May, 1871.[453] The\r\ncommunards fought fundamentally against state centralization, whether\r\nor not involving a revival of monarchy. The fate of republicanism was\r\nnot in any real measure bound up with their cause, so that after the\r\nmovement had been suppressed, with startling ruthlessness, by the\r\nGovernment, the political future of the nation remained no less in\r\ndoubt than previously it had been. Thiers continued at the post of\r\nChief of the Executive, and the Assembly, clothed by its own\r\nassumption with powers immeasurably in excess of those it had been\r\nelected to exercise, and limited by no fixed term, gave not the\r\nslightest indication of a purpose to terminate its career. Rather, the\r\nbody proceeded, August 31, 1871, to pass, by a vote of 491 to 94, the\r\nRivet law, whereby the existing régime was to be perpetuated\r\nindefinitely.[454] By this measure unrestricted sovereignty, involving\r\nthe exercise of both constituent and legislative powers, was declared\r\nby the Assembly to be vested in itself. Upon the Chief of the\r\nExecutive was conferred the title of President of the French Republic;\r\nand it was stipulated that this official should thereafter be\r\nresponsible to the Assembly, and presumably removable by it. A\r\nquasi-republic, with a crude parliamentary system of government,\r\nthereafter existed _de facto_; but it had as yet absolutely no\r\nconstitutional basis.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 453: In March the Assembly had\r\n                   transferred its sittings from Bordeaux to\r\n                   Versailles.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 454: Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 315-316; Anderson, Constitutions,\r\n                   604-606.]\r\n\r\n*328. Failure of the Monarchist Programmes.*--This anomalous condition\r\nof things lasted many months, during the course of which Thiers and\r\nthe Assembly served the nation admirably through the promotion of its\r\nrecovery from the ravages of war. More and more Thiers, who had begun\r\nas a constitutional monarchist, came to believe in republicanism as\r\nthe style of government which would divide the French people least,\r\nand late in 1872 he put himself unqualifiedly among the adherents of\r\nthe republican programme. Thereupon the monarchists, united for the\r\nmoment in the conviction that for the good of their several causes\r\nThiers must be deposed from his position of influence, brought about\r\nin the Assembly a majority vote in opposition to him, and so induced\r\nhis resignation, May 24, 1873.[455] The opponents of republicanism now\r\nfelt that the hour had come for the termination of a governmental\r\nrégime which had by them been regarded all the while as purely     (p. 304)\r\nprovisional. The monarchist Marshal MacMahon was made President, a\r\ncoalition ministry of monarchists under the Orleanist Duke of Broglie\r\nwas formed, and republicanism in press and politics was put under the\r\nban. Between the Legitimists and the Orleanists there was worked out\r\nan ingenious compromise whereby the Bourbon Count of Chambord was to\r\nbe made king under the title of Henry V. and, he having no heirs, the\r\nOrleanist Count of Paris was to be recognized as his successor. The\r\nwhole project was brought to naught, however, by the persistent\r\nrefusal of the Count of Chambord to give up the white flag, which for\r\ncenturies had been the standard of the Bourbon house. The Orleanists\r\nheld out for the tricolor; and thus, on what would appear to most\r\npeople a question of distinctly minor consequence, the survival of the\r\nRepublic was for the time determined.[456]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 455: Anderson, Constitutions, 622-627; A.\r\n                   Lefèvre Pontalis, L'Assemblée nationale et M.\r\n                   Thiers, in _Le Correspondant_, Feb. 10, 1879; A.\r\n                   Thiers, Notes et Souvenirs de 1870 à 1873 (Paris,\r\n                   1903); J.

The opportunity, however,\r\nnever came, and the septennial period for the French presidency,\r\nestablished thus by monarchists in their own interest, was destined to\r\npass into the permanent mechanism of a republican state.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 457: Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 319; Anderson, Constitutions, 630.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CONSTITUTION OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\n*329. Circumstances of Formation.*--Meanwhile the way was opening for\r\nFrance to acquire what for some years she had lacked completely, i.e.,\r\na constitution. May 19, 1873, the minister Dufaure, in behalf of\r\nthe Government, laid before the Assembly _projets_ of two organic\r\nmeasures, both of which, in slightly amended form, passed in 1875 into\r\nthe permanent constitution of the Republic. May 24 occurred the\r\nretirement of President Thiers, and likewise that of Dufaure, but in\r\nthe Assembly, the two proposed measures were none the less referred to\r\na commission of thirty. Consideration in committee was sluggish, and\r\nthe Assembly itself was not readily roused to action. During the\r\ntwelvemonth that followed several _projets_ were brought forward, and\r\nthere was desultory discussion, but no progress. In the summer of  (p. 305)\r\n1874 a new commission of thirty was elected and to it was intrusted\r\nthe task of studying and reporting upon all of the numerous\r\nconstitutional laws that had been suggested. The majority of this\r\ncommission, monarchist by inclination, contented itself with\r\nproposing, in January, 1875, a law providing simply for the\r\ncontinuance of the existing \"septennate.\" Only after earnest effort,\r\nand by the narrow vote of 353 to 352, were the republican forces in\r\nthe Assembly able to carry an amendment, proposed by the deputy\r\nWallon, in which was made definite provision for the election of the\r\nPresident of the Republic, and therefore, by reasonable inference, for\r\nthe perpetuity of the Republic itself.[458]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 458: Anderson, Constitutions, 633.]\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1875 was far advanced the Assembly threw off its\r\nlethargy and for the first time in its history addressed itself\r\nsystematically to the drafting of a national constitution. To this\r\ncourse it was impelled by the propaganda of Gambetta and other\r\nrepublican leaders, by fear on the part of the Legitimists and\r\nOrleanists that the existing inchoate situation would lead to a\r\nBonapartist revival, and by a new _modus operandi_ which was cleverly\r\narranged between the republicans and the Orleanists. Convinced that an\r\nOrleanist monarchy was, at least for a time, an impossibility, and\r\npreferring a republic to any alternative which had been suggested, the\r\nOrleanist members of the Assembly gave their support in sufficient\r\nnumbers to the programme of the republicans to render it at last\r\npossible to work out for the nation a conservatively republican\r\nconstitutional system.\r\n\r\n*330. Texts and General Nature.*--Of the organic laws which comprise the\r\nconstitution of France to-day five which date from 1875 are of\r\nprincipal importance: (1) that of February 24, on the Organization of\r\nthe Senate; (2) that of February 25,--the most important of all,--on\r\nthe Organization of the Public Powers; (3) that of July 16, on the\r\nRelations of the Public Powers; (4) that of August 3, on the Election\r\nof Senators; and (5) that of November 30, on the Election of Deputies.\r\nCollectively, these measures are sometimes referred to as the\r\n\"constitution of 1875.\" Other and later constitutional enactments of\r\nconsiderable importance include (1) the law of July 22, 1879, relating\r\nto the seat of the Executive Power and of the two Chambers at Paris;\r\n(2) the law of December 9, 1884, amending existing organic laws on the\r\nOrganization of the Senate and the Election of Senators; and (3) laws\r\nof June 16, 1885, and February 13 and July 17, 1889, respecting the\r\nElection of Deputies.[459]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 459: The original texts of these\r\n                   documents are printed in Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 319-350, and Hélie, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, 1348-1456.

Academy_, July, 1895.]\r\n\r\nSpringing from the peculiar conditions which have been described,  (p. 306)\r\nthe handiwork of a body in which only a minority felt the slightest\r\ndegree of enthusiasm for it, the constitution of the French Republic\r\nis essentially unlike any instrument of government with which the\r\nEnglish-speaking world is familiar. It differs from the British in\r\nhaving been put almost wholly into written form. It differs from the\r\nAmerican in that it consists, not of a single document, but of many,\r\nand in that it emanated, not from a great constituent assembly,\r\ncharged with the specific task of formulating a governmental system,\r\nbut from a law-making body which in truth had never been formally\r\nintrusted by the nation with even the powers of legislation proper,\r\nand had merely arrogated to itself those functions of constitution-framing\r\nwhich it chose to exercise.[460] It consists simply of organic laws,\r\nenacted chiefly by the provisional Assembly of 1871-1875, but amended\r\nand amplified to some extent by the national parliament in subsequent\r\nyears. Unlike the majority of constitutions that went before it in\r\nFrance, it is not orderly in its arrangement or comprehensive in its\r\ncontents. It is devoid of anything in the nature of a bill of\r\nrights,[461] and concerning the sovereignty of the people it has\r\nnothing to say. Even in respect to many essential aspects of\r\ngovernmental organization and practice it is mute. It contains no\r\nprovision respecting annual budgets, and it leaves untouched the\r\nentire field of the judiciary. The instrument lays down only certain\r\nbroad lines of organization; the rest it leaves to be supplied through\r\nthe channels of ordinary legislation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 460: Among French writers upon\r\n                   constitutional law there has been no small amount\r\n                   of difference of opinion as to whether the National\r\n                   Assembly is to be regarded as having been entitled\r\n                   to the exercise of constituent powers. For a brief\r\n                   affirmative argument see Duguit et Monnier, Les\r\n                   Constitutions, cxvii. Cf. Dicey, Law of the\r\n                   Constitution, 121, note.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 461: It is to be observed, however, that\r\n                   many authorities agree with Professor Duguit in his\r\n                   contention that although the individual rights\r\n                   enumerated in the Declaration of Rights of 1789 are\r\n                   passed without mention in the constitutional laws\r\n                   of 1875, they are to be considered as lying at the\r\n                   basis of the French governmental system to-day. Any\r\n                   measure enacted by the national parliament in\r\n                   contravention of them, says Professor Duguit, would\r\n                   be unconstitutional. They are not mere dogmas or\r\n                   theories, but rather positive laws, binding upon\r\n                   not only the legislative chambers but upon the\r\n                   constituent National Assembly. Traité de droit\r\n                   constitutionnel (Paris, 1911), II., 13.]\r\n\r\n*331. Amendment.*--It was the desire of all parties in 1875 that   (p. 307)\r\nthe constitutional laws should be easy of amendment, and indeed most\r\nmen of the time expected the governmental system which was being\r\nestablished to undergo, sooner or later, fundamental modification. The\r\nprocess of amendment is stipulated in the law of February 25,\r\n1875.[462] Amendments may be proposed by the President of the Republic\r\nor by either of the chambers of Parliament. When, by a majority of\r\nvotes in each, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies declare a revision\r\nof the constitutional laws necessary, the two chambers are required to\r\nbe convened in the character of a National Assembly, and amendments\r\nare adopted by absolute majority of this composite body. Contrary to\r\nearlier French practice, the exercise of constituent and of ordinary\r\nlegislative powers is thus lodged in the same body of men, the only\r\ndifference of procedure in the two instances arising from the\r\ntemporary amalgamation of the chambers for constituent purposes. The\r\nsole limitation that has been imposed upon the revising powers of the\r\nAssembly is contained in a clause adopted in an amendment of August\r\n14, 1884, which forbids that the republican style of government be\r\nmade the subject of a proposed revision. In point of fact, amendments\r\nhave been few, although some, as that of December 9, 1884, modifying\r\nthe methods of electing senators and those of June 16, 1885, and\r\nFebruary 13 and July 17, 1889, re-establishing single districts for\r\nthe election of deputies and prohibiting multiple candidatures, have\r\nbeen of a high degree of importance.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 462: Art. 8. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 288.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI                                                        (p. 308)\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT, THE MINISTRY, AND PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nUnder the French system of government functions of a purely executive\r\nnature are vested in the President of the Republic and the Ministry,\r\nassisted by a numerous and highly centralized body of administrative\r\nofficials. The presidency had its origin in the unsettled period\r\nfollowing the Prussian war when it was commonly believed that\r\nmonarchy, in one form or another, would eventually be re-established.\r\nThe title \"President of the Republic\" was created in 1871; but the\r\noffice as it exists to-day hardly antedates the election of Marshal\r\nMacMahon in 1873. The character and functions of the presidency were\r\ndetermined in no small measure by the circumstance that by those who\r\ncreated the dignity it was intended merely to keep the French people\r\naccustomed to visible personal supremacy, and so to make easier the\r\nfuture transition to a monarchical system. Counting Thiers, the\r\nRepublic has had thus far nine presidents: Adolphe Thiers, 1871-1873;\r\nMarshal MacMahon, 1873-1879; Jules Grévy, 1879-1887; F. Sadi-Carnot,\r\n1887-1894; Casimir-Perier, June, 1894, to January, 1895; Félix Faure,\r\n1895-1899; Émile Loubet, 1899-1906; Armand Fallières, 1906-1913; and\r\nRaymond Poincaré elected early in 1913.\r\n\r\n*332. Election and Qualifications.*--The President is chosen for seven\r\nyears by an electoral college consisting of the members of the Senate\r\nand of the Chamber of Deputies, meeting at Versailles in National\r\nAssembly. The choice is by absolute majority of the combined body. The\r\nconstitutional law of July 16, 1875, stipulates that one month, at\r\nleast, before the expiration of his term the President shall call\r\ntogether the National Assembly for the election of a successor. In\r\ndefault of such summons, the meeting takes place automatically on the\r\nfifteenth day before the expiration; and in the event of the death or\r\nresignation of the President the Chambers are required to assemble\r\nimmediately without summons.[463] There is no vice-president, nor  (p. 309)\r\nany law of succession, so that whenever the presidential office falls\r\nvacant there must be a new election; and, at whatever time and under\r\nwhatever circumstance begun, the term of the newly elected President\r\nis regularly seven years. As upon the occasion of the assassination of\r\nSadi-Carnot in 1894, a vacancy may arise wholly unexpectedly. Under\r\neven the most normal conditions, however, the election of a President\r\nin France is attended by no period of campaigning comparable with that\r\nwhich attends a similar event in the United States. The Assembly\r\nhabitually selects a man who has long been a member, and has perhaps\r\nserved as president, of one or the other of the chambers, who has had\r\nexperience in committee work and, as a rule, in one or more\r\nministerial offices, and who, above all things, is not too aggressive\r\nor domineering. An election is likely to be carried through all stages\r\nwithin the space of forty-eight hours. The qualifications requisite\r\nfor election are extremely broad. Until 1884 any male citizen,\r\nregardless of age, affiliation, or circumstance, was eligible. In the\r\nyear mentioned members of families that have reigned in France were\r\ndebarred, and this remains the only formal disqualification. A\r\nPresident is eligible indefinitely for re-election.[464]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 463: Art. 3. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 291.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 464: A. Tridon, France's Way of Choosing\r\n                   a President, in _Review of Reviews_, Dec., 1912.]\r\n\r\n*333. Privileges.*--The President is paid the sum of 1,200,000 francs a\r\nyear, half as salary, half to cover travelling expenses and the\r\noutlays incumbent upon him as the official representative of the\r\nnation. He resides in the Palais de l'Élysée, where he maintains in a\r\nmeasure the state and ceremony that ordinarily are associated only\r\nwith monarchy. His dignity is safeguarded by special and effective\r\npenalties for insult and libel. Like the President of the United\r\nStates, during his term of office he is exempt from the processes of\r\nthe ordinary courts; but, like his American counterpart, he may be\r\ntried by the Senate, on articles of impeachment presented by the lower\r\nlegislative chamber. The President of the United States may be\r\nimpeached for \"treason, bribery, and other high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors\"; the French President may be impeached for treason only.\r\nOn the other hand, whereas the penalty that may be imposed upon the\r\nAmerican President by the judgment of the Senate is confined to\r\nremoval from office and disqualification to hold office, the French\r\nconstitution fixes no limit to the penalty which may be visited upon a\r\nPresident convicted of treason. So far as the law is concerned, he\r\nmight be condemned to death.\r\n\r\n*334. Powers: Participation in Law-making.*--The President possesses\r\npowers which are numerous and, on paper at least, formidable. A    (p. 310)\r\nfirst group pertains to the making of law. \"The President of the\r\nRepublic,\" says the constitutional law of February 25, 1875, \"shall\r\nhave the initiative of laws, concurrently with the members of the two\r\nchambers. He shall promulgate the laws when they have been voted by\r\nthe two chambers; and he shall look after and secure their\r\nexecution.\"[465] The concurrent power of initiating legislation,\r\nexercised through the Ministry, is something that is not possessed by\r\nthe American President, who can do no more than suggest and recommend\r\nmeasures he deems desirable. The President of France, on the other\r\nhand, possesses only a suspensive veto. He may remand a measure of\r\nwhich he disapproves for fresh consideration by Parliament; but if it\r\nis re-enacted, by even a simple majority, it is incumbent upon him to\r\npromulgate it as law. If, however, the veto power is virtually\r\nnon-existent, the President possesses an important prerogative in the\r\nright of issuing ordinances with the force of supplementary\r\nlegislation. These may be not merely executive orders in matters of\r\ndetail, such as are issued by the President of the United States, but\r\nsweeping injunctions deemed essential to the enforcement of the laws\r\nin general. The only limitation is that such ordinances must not\r\ncontravene the constitution or any enactment of the chambers. The\r\npower is one which, rather curiously, rests upon no express\r\nconstitutional provision, but simply upon custom. The right which the\r\nPresident possesses, with the consent of the Senate, to dissolve the\r\nChamber of Deputies before the expiration of its term, thereby\r\nprecipitating a general election, may also be made the means of\r\nexercising considerable influence upon legislative processes and\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 465: Art. 3. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 286.]\r\n\r\n*335. Powers: Executive and Judicial.*--As the head of the national\r\nadministration, the President appoints to all civil and military\r\noffices connected with the central government. His appointments do not\r\nrequire ratification by the Senate, or by any other body. He may even\r\ncreate, by decree, new offices. And his power of removal from office,\r\nsave in certain cases, is absolutely without restriction. Appointments\r\nand removals, however, are in practice made through the Ministry, and\r\nthe President has no patronage at his immediate disposal other than\r\nthat of the posts in his own household. In respect to foreign affairs\r\nthe President's powers are more substantial. Like the American\r\nPresident, he represents his country in the sending and receiving of\r\nambassadors, ministers, envoys, and consuls, and in the negotiation\r\nand conclusion of treaties. Treaties affecting peace, commerce,\r\nterritorial possessions, finances, or the status of Frenchmen in\r\nforeign countries, require the ratification of the chambers; others\r\ncall for no such action, and even a foreign alliance may be        (p. 311)\r\nconcluded by the Executive working independently. On the military\r\nside, the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the\r\nnation, military and naval. He may not declare war without the consent\r\nof the chambers; but through the conduct of foreign affairs he may at\r\nany time, very much as may the President of the United States, create\r\na situation by which war will be rendered inevitable. Finally, the\r\nPresident is vested with the powers of pardon and reprieve, although\r\namnesty may be granted only by law.[466]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 466: Dupriez, Les Ministres, II.,\r\n                   358-372; J. Nadal, Attributions du président de la\r\n                   république en France et aux États-Unis (Toulouse,\r\n                   1909). For a brief American discussion of the same\r\n                   subject see M. Smith, The French Presidency and the\r\n                   American, in _Review of Reviews_, Feb., 1906. Cf.\r\n                   A. Cohn, Why M. Fallières is an Ideal French\r\n                   President, ibid., July, 1908.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*336. Importance in the Government.*--\"There is,\" says an English writer\r\nof the last generation, \"no living functionary who occupies a more\r\npitiable position than a French President. The old kings of France\r\nreigned and governed. The Constitutional King, according to M. Thiers,\r\nreigns, but does not govern. The President of the United States\r\ngoverns, but he does not reign. It has been reserved for the President\r\nof the French Republic neither to reign nor yet to govern.\"[467] The\r\nweakness of the French President's position arises specifically from\r\ntwo clauses of the constitutional law of February 25, 1875. One of\r\nthem stipulates that \"every act of the President of the Republic shall\r\nbe countersigned by a minister.\" The other provides that \"the\r\nministers shall be collectively responsible to the chambers for the\r\ngeneral policy of the government, and individually for their personal\r\nacts.\"[468] Under the operation of these principles the Ministry\r\nbecomes the real executive. Like the sovereign of Great Britain, the\r\nPresident can do no wrong, because the acts that are officially his\r\nare in reality performed by the ministers, who alone (save in the case\r\nof treason) are responsible for them. Chosen by the members of\r\nParliament, the President belongs normally to the party group which is\r\nat the time in the ascendant, and by it he is kept in tutelage. The\r\nleaders of this group are the ministers, and, in a very large measure,\r\nthe President simply approves passively the policies of this body of\r\nmen and signs and promulgates the measures which it carries through\r\nthe chambers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 467: Henry Maine, Popular Government\r\n                   (London, 1885), 250.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 468: Arts. 3 and 6. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 287.]\r\n\r\n*337. Organization and Functions.*--Ministerial portfolios are created\r\nby executive decree. Their number has been somewhat variable. In   (p. 312)\r\n1875 there were nine. In 1879 there was created a tenth. Between 1881\r\nand 1887 there were eleven. To-day there are twelve, as follows: (1)\r\nInterior; (2) Finance; (3) War; (4) Justice and Public Worship; (5)\r\nMarine; (6) Colonies; (7) Public Instruction; (8) Foreign Affairs; (9)\r\nCommerce; (10) Agriculture; (11) Public Works and Posts, Telegraphs,\r\nand Telephones; and (12) Labor. Portfolios may be not only created but\r\nrearranged by simple executive decree, though of course the necessary\r\nfinancial provisions are conditioned upon the approval of the\r\nchambers. The premier may occupy any one of the ministerial posts, or\r\neven two of them at one time. He is named by the President, and he,\r\nacting with the President, designates his colleagues and allots to\r\nthem their respective portfolios. Usually, though not necessarily, the\r\nministers are members of the Senate or of the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nprincipally the latter.[469] Whether members or not, they have a right\r\nto attend all sessions of both chambers and to take an especially\r\nprivileged part in debate. Ministers receive annual salaries of 60,000\r\nfrancs and reside, as a rule, in the official mansions maintained for\r\nthe heads of the departments they control.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 469: In earlier days the ministers of war\r\n                   and of the marine were selected not infrequently\r\n                   from outside Parliament, but this practice has been\r\n                   discontinued.]\r\n\r\nCollectively the ministers possess two sets of functions which are\r\nessentially distinct. The one they fulfill as a \"council\"; the other\r\nas a \"cabinet.\" In the capacity of a council they exercise a general\r\nsupervision of the administration of the laws, to the end that there\r\nmay be efficiency and unity in the affairs of state. In the event of\r\nthe President's death, incapacitation, or resignation, the Council is\r\nauthorized to act as head of the state until the National Assembly\r\nshall have chosen a successor. As a cabinet the ministers formulate\r\nthe fundamental policies of the Government and represent it in the\r\nchambers. The Council is administrative and is expressly recognized by\r\nlaw; the Cabinet is political and is not so recognized. In the\r\nmeetings of the Council the President of the Republic not only sits,\r\nbut presides; in those of the Cabinet he rarely even appears. Aside\r\nfrom the President, however, the two bodies, in personnel, are\r\nidentical.[470]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 470: Dupriez, Les ministres, II.,\r\n                   332-357.

The Parliamentary System: Multiplicity of Parties.*--On paper\r\nFrance has to-day a parliamentary system of government substantially\r\nlike that which prevails in Great Britain. The President's         (p. 313)\r\nauthority is but nominal. The real executive consists of the ministers.\r\nThese ministers are responsible, collectively in general matters and\r\nindividually in particular ones, to the chambers, in reality to the\r\nChamber of Deputies. When defeated on any important proposition, they\r\nresign as a body. Parliamentary government in France means, however,\r\nin practice, something very different from what it means across the\r\nChannel. The principal reason why this is so is to be found in the\r\ntotally different status of political parties in the two countries. In\r\nGreat Britain, while in later years small political groups have sprung\r\nup to complicate the situation, the political life of the nation is\r\nstill confined very largely to the two great rival parties, which\r\noppose to each other a fairly united front, and between which there is\r\nnot likely to be anything like fusion or affiliation. In France, on\r\nthe contrary, there is a multiplicity of parties and no one of them is\r\nlikely ever to be in a position to dominate the Government alone. The\r\nelection of 1910 sent to the Chamber of Deputies representatives of no\r\nfewer than nine distinct political groups. No ministry can be made up\r\nwith any hope of its being able to command a working majority in the\r\nChamber unless it represents in its membership a coalition of several\r\nparties. A Government so constituted, however, is almost inevitably\r\nvacillating and short-lived. It is unable to please all of the groups\r\nand interests upon which it relies; it dares displease none; it ends\r\nnot infrequently by displeasing all.\r\n\r\n*339. Frequency of Ministerial Changes.*--It is from this condition of\r\nthings that there arises the remarkable frequency with which\r\nministerial crises and ministerial changes take place in France. The\r\nministry of M. Poincaré, established in January, 1912, was the\r\nforty-fifth in the history of French parliamentarism since 1875--a\r\nperiod of but thirty-seven years. Between 1875 and 1900 but four years\r\nelapsed without at least one change of ministry. Since 1900 changes\r\nhave been somewhat less frequent. The Waldeck-Rousseau ministry of\r\n1899-1902--the longest-lived since 1875--endured virtually three\r\nyears; the Combes ministry of 1902-1905 lasted more than two years and\r\na half; and the Clemenceau ministry of 1906-1909 fell but little short\r\nof two years and nine months. None the less, a total of nine\r\nministries within the space of thirteen years means an average of but\r\none year and a half to the ministry. It is but fair to say that the\r\nordinary \"crisis\" is not likely to involve a complete ministerial\r\nchange. Defeated in the Chamber, or unable to make progress, the\r\nministry as a body resigns; but, as a rule, many of the members are\r\nimmediately reappointed, with perhaps a change of portfolios. A certain\r\ncontinuity arises also from the fact that the subordinate          (p. 314)\r\nofficials in the various departments enjoy a reasonable fixity of\r\ntenure. Nevertheless the most obvious feature of parliamentary\r\ngovernment as it exists to-day in France, and in other continental\r\ncountries, is its instability. Only where, as in England, there are\r\ntwo great parties, each possessing solidarity and sufficient strength,\r\nif returned to power, to support a homogeneous and sympathetic\r\nministry, can the more desirable results of the parliamentary system\r\nbe realized in full. There is as yet no evidence that such parties are\r\nin France in process of development.[471]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 471: A French scholar writes: \"Power\r\n                   cannot pass alternately, as in England and the\r\n                   United States, from the party on one side over to\r\n                   the party in opposition. This alternation, this\r\n                   game of see-saw between two opposing parties, which\r\n                   certain theorists have declared to be the\r\n                   indispensable condition of every parliamentary\r\n                   régime, does not exist, and has never existed, in\r\n                   France. The reason why is simple. If the party of\r\n                   the Right, hostile to the Republic, should come\r\n                   into power, the temptation would be too strong for\r\n                   them to maintain themselves there by establishing\r\n                   an autocratic government, which would put an end to\r\n                   the parliamentary régime, as in 1851. The electors\r\n                   are conscious of this tendency of the\r\n                   Conservatives, and will not run the risk of\r\n                   entrusting the Republic to them. When they are\r\n                   discontented with the Republicans in power, they\r\n                   vote for other Republicans. Thus, new Republican\r\n                   groups are being ceaselessly formed, while the old\r\n                   ones fall to pieces.\" C. Seignobos, The Political\r\n                   Parties of France, in _International Monthly_,\r\n                   Aug., 1901, 155.

Pierre, Principes du droit politique électoral\r\n                   et parlementaire en France (Paris, 1893).]\r\n\r\n*340. Interpellation.*--The precariousness of the position occupied by\r\nFrench ministries is enhanced by the parliamentary device of\r\ninterpellation. As in Great Britain, every member of the two chambers\r\npossesses the right at any time to put to an executive head a direct\r\nquestion concerning any affair of state which, without impropriety,\r\nmay be made the subject of open discussion. A minister may not,\r\nhowever, be questioned without his consent, and the incident\r\nordinarily passes without debate. In France, however, any member may\r\ndirect at a minister an interpellation, designed not to obtain\r\ninformation, but to put the Government on the defensive and to\r\nprecipitate a debate which may end in the overthrow of the ministry on\r\nsome mere technicality or other matter in itself of but slight\r\nimportance. The interpellation is a challenge. It is made the special\r\norder for a day fixed by the chamber, and it almost invariably results\r\nin a vote of confidence, or want of confidence, in the ministers. As\r\nemployed in France, the interpellation lends itself too readily to the\r\nends of sheer factiousness to be adjudged a valuable feature of\r\nparliamentary procedure.[472]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 472: Dupriez, Les Ministres, II.,\r\n                   432-461.

PARLIAMENT: SENATE AND CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES                    (p. 315)\r\n\r\n*341. The Bicameral System.*--With the dissolution of the States General\r\nin 1789, France definitely abandoned a parliamentary system based upon\r\nthe mediæval principle of orders or estates. Throughout upwards of a\r\nhundred years, however, the scheme of parliamentary organization which\r\nwas to take the place of that which had been cast aside continued\r\nuncertain. During the Revolution ultra-democratic reformers very\r\ngenerally favored the maintenance of a national assembly of but a\r\nsingle house, and it was not until the promulgation of the\r\nconstitution of 1795 that a frame of government including provision\r\nfor a legislature of two houses was brought into operation. The\r\nbicameral system of 1795-1799 was succeeded by the anomalous\r\nlegislative régime of Napoleon, but under the Constitutional Charter\r\nof 1814 the two-house principle was revived and continuously applied\r\nthrough a period of thirty-four years. The legislative organ of the\r\nSecond Republic was a unicameral assembly, but an incident of the\r\ntransition to the Second Empire was the revival of a Senate, and\r\nthroughout the reign of Napoleon III. the legislative chambers were\r\nnominally two in number, although it was not until 1870 that the\r\nSenate as a legislative body was made co-ordinate with the _Corps\r\nlégislatif_. On the whole, it can be affirmed that at the period when\r\nthe constitution of the Third Republic was given form, the political\r\nexperience of the nation had demonstrated the bicameral system to be\r\nthe most natural, the safest, and the most effective. The opening\r\nstipulation of the Constitutional Law on the Organization of the\r\nPublic Powers, adopted February 25, 1875, was that the law-making\r\npower of France should be exercised by a national parliament\r\nconsisting of (1) a Chamber of Deputies and (2) a Senate. The one, it\r\nwas determined, should rest upon a broadly democratic basis. The other\r\nwas planned, as is customary with second chambers, to stand somewhat\r\nfurther removed from the immediate control of the voters of the\r\ncountry. But the two were intended to exist fundamentally to enact\r\ninto law the will of the people, in whom the sovereignty of the French\r\nnation is clearly lodged. And even the most casual survey of the\r\nFrench governmental system as it operates to-day will impress the fact\r\nthat the structure and organization of the parliamentary body have\r\nlent themselves to the usages of a democratic state in a measure even\r\nexceeding that intended by the founders of the existing order.\r\n\r\n*342. The Senate as Originally Established.*--Having determined that the\r\nparliament should consist of two branches, the National Assembly, in\r\n1875, faced the difficult problem of constituting an upper chamber (p. 316)\r\nthat should not be a mere replica of the lower, and yet should not\r\ninject into a democratic constitutional system an incongruous element\r\nof aristocracy. The device hit upon was a chamber, seats in which\r\nshould be wholly elective, yet not at the immediate disposal of the\r\npeople. By the constitutional law of February 24, 1875, it was\r\nprovided that the Senate should consist of three hundred members, of\r\nwhom two hundred twenty-five should be elected by the departments and\r\ncolonies and seventy-five by the National Assembly itself.[473] The\r\ndepartments of the Seine and of the Nord were authorized to elect five\r\nsenators each, the others four, three, or two, as specified in the\r\nlaw. The senators of the departments and of the colonies were to be\r\nelected by an absolute majority and by _scrutin de liste_, by a\r\ncollege meeting at the capital of the department or colony, composed\r\nof the deputies and general councillors and of delegates elected, one\r\nby each municipal council, from among the voters of the communes.\r\nSenators chosen by the Assembly were to be elected by _scrutin de\r\nliste_ and by an absolute majority of votes. No one should be chosen\r\nwho had not attained the age of forty years, and who was not in\r\nenjoyment of full civil and political rights. The seventy-five elected\r\nby the Assembly were to retain their seats for life, vacancies that\r\nshould arise being filled by the Senate itself. All other members were\r\nto be elected for nine years, being renewed by thirds every three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 473: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I.,\r\n                   288.]\r\n\r\n*343. The Senate: Composition and Election To-day.*--The system thus\r\ndevised continues, in the main, in effect at the present day. The\r\nprincipal variations from it are those introduced in a constitutional\r\nlaw of December 9, 1884, whereby it was provided (1) that the\r\nco-optative method of election should be abolished, and that, while\r\npresent life members should retain their seats as long as they should\r\nlive, all vacancies thereafter arising from the decease of such\r\nmembers should be filled within the departments in the regular manner,\r\nand (2) that the electoral college of the department should be\r\nbroadened to include not merely one delegate from each municipal\r\ncouncil, but from one to twenty-four (thirty in the case of Paris),\r\naccording to the number of members in the council.[474] By the same\r\nlaw members of families that have reigned in France were declared\r\nineligible; and by act of July 20, 1895, no one may become a member of\r\neither branch of Parliament unless he has complied with the law\r\nregarding military service.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 474: Ibid., I., 310.]\r\n\r\nFew of the life members survive to-day. When they shall have\r\ndisappeared, the French Senate will comprise a compact body of three\r\nhundred men apportioned among the departments in approximate       (p. 317)\r\naccordance with population and chosen in all cases by bodies of\r\nelectors all of whom have themselves been elected directly by the\r\npeople. The present apportionment gives to the department of the Seine\r\nten members; to that of the Nord, eight; to others, five four, three,\r\nand two apiece, down to the territory of Belfort and the three\r\ndepartments of Algeria, and the colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe,\r\nRéunion, and the French West Indies, which return one each. From\r\nhaving long been viewed by republicans with suspicion, the Senate has\r\ncome to be regarded by Frenchmen generally as perhaps the most perfect\r\nwork of the Republic.[475] In these days its membership is recruited\r\nvery largely from the Deputies, so that it includes not only many men\r\nof distinction in letters and science but an unusual proportion of\r\nexperienced debaters and parliamentarians. A leading American\r\nauthority has said that it is \"composed of as impressive a body of men\r\nas can be found in any legislative chamber the world over.\"[476] The\r\nsittings of the Senate, since 1879, have been held in the Palais du\r\nLuxembourg, a splendid structure on the left bank of the Seine dating\r\nfrom the early seventeenth century.[477]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 475: J. C. Bracq, France under the\r\n                   Republic (New York, 1910), 8.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 476: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   22. But compare the view set forth in J. S. C.\r\n                   Bodley, France, 2 vols. (London, 1898), I., 46-60.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 477: O. Pyfferoen, Du sénat en France et\r\n                   dans les Pays-Bas (Brussels, 1892).]\r\n\r\n*344. The Chamber of Deputies: Composition.*--The 597 members of the\r\nlower legislative branch are chosen directly by the people, under\r\nconditions regulated by a series of electoral measures, principally\r\nthe organic law of November 30, 1875.[478] The franchise is extended\r\nto all male inhabitants who have attained the age of twenty-one, and\r\nwho are not convicts, bankrupts, under guardianship, or in active\r\nmilitary or naval service. Of educational or property qualifications\r\nthere are none. The only requirements are that the voter shall have\r\nhis name inscribed on the electoral lists and shall be able to prove a\r\nresidence of six months in the commune in which he proposes to cast\r\nhis ballot. The conditions of the franchise are prescribed by the\r\nstate; but the keeping and the annual revision of the electoral lists\r\ndevolves upon the commune, and the lists are identical for communal,\r\ndistrict, departmental, and national elections. The French\r\nregistration system is notably effective and, as compared with the\r\nBritish, inexpensive.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 478: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I.,\r\n                   302-308.]\r\n\r\n*345. Electoral Unit and Parliamentary Candidacies.*--The electoral area\r\nin France is the arrondissement, an administrative subdivision of  (p. 318)\r\nthe department. Each arrondissement returns one deputy, unless its\r\npopulation exceeds 100,000, in which case it is divided into\r\nsingle-member constituencies, one for each 100,000 or remaining\r\nfraction thereof. A fresh apportionment is made after each\r\nquinquennial census, when to each of the eighty-six departments is\r\nallotted a quota of representatives proportioned to population. The\r\npresent method of election, under which the individual elector votes\r\nwithin his arrondissement or district for one deputy only, is known as\r\nthe _scrutin d'arrondissement_. Established in 1876, the _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_ was employed until 1885, when, at the behest of\r\nGambetta, a change was made to a system under which deputies for an\r\nentire department were voted for on a general ticket, as, for example,\r\npresidential electors are voted for in an American state. This\r\nsystem--the so-called _scrutin de liste_--was maintained in operation\r\nonly until 1889, when the _scrutin d'arrondissement_ was\r\nre-established.[479]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 479: Laws of June 16, 1885, and February\r\n                   13, 1889; Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 316-318.]\r\n\r\nThe full membership of the Chamber is elected simultaneously, for a\r\nfour-year term, save in the event that the Chamber shall be sooner\r\ndissolved. No nomination, or similar formality, is required of the\r\ncandidate. To be eligible, however, he must be a qualified voter and\r\nas much as twenty-five years of age. By law of November 30, 1875,\r\nstate officials are forbidden to become candidates in districts where\r\ntheir position might enable them to influence elections, and by act of\r\nJune 16, 1885, members of families who have ever reigned in France are\r\ndebarred. All that is required of a person who, possessing the\r\nrequisite legal qualifications, wishes to be a candidate is that five\r\ndays before the election he shall deposit with the prefect of the\r\ndepartment within which the polling is to take place a declaration,\r\nwitnessed by a mayor, of the name of the constituency in which he\r\nproposes to seek election. Even this trifling formality was introduced\r\nonly by the Multiple Candidature Act of 1889, by which it is\r\nstipulated that no person shall be a candidate in more than one\r\ndistrict. The French electorate is proverbially indifferent concerning\r\nthe exercise of the suffrage, but the methods of campaigning which\r\nhave become familiar in other countries are employed systematically,\r\nand no small measure of popular interest is occasionally aroused.[480]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 480: \"During the electoral period,\r\n                   circulars and platforms signed by the candidates,\r\n                   electoral placards and manifestoes signed by one or\r\n                   more voters, may, after being deposited with the\r\n                   public prosecutor, be posted and distributed\r\n                   without previous authorization.\" Organic Law of\r\n                   November 30, 1875, Art. 3.]\r\n\r\n*346. The Conduct of Parliamentary Elections.*--The electoral      (p. 319)\r\nprocess is simple and inexpensive. Voting is by secret ballot, and the\r\nballoting lasts one day only. As a rule, the polling takes place in\r\nthe _mairie_, or municipal building, of the commune, under the\r\nimmediate supervision of an electoral bureau consisting of a president\r\n(usually the mayor), four assessors, and a secretary. The state does\r\nnot provide ballot-papers, but one or more of the candidates may be\r\ndepended upon to supply the deficiency. The count is public and the\r\nresult is announced without delay. If it is found that no candidate\r\nwithin the district has polled an absolute majority of the votes cast,\r\nand at the same time a fourth of the number which the registered\r\nvoters of the district are legally capable of casting, a second\r\nballoting (the so-called _ballottage_) is ordered for one week from\r\nthe ensuing Sunday. No one of the candidates voted for drops out of\r\nthe contest, unless by voluntary withdrawal; new candidates, at even\r\nso late a day, may enter the race; and whoever, at the second\r\nballoting, secures a simple plurality is declared elected. By\r\nobservers generally it is considered that the principle of the second\r\nballot, in the form in which it is applied in France, possesses no\r\nvery decisive value. Through a variety of agencies the central\r\ngovernment is accustomed to exert substantial influence in\r\nparliamentary elections; but all of the more important political\r\ngroups have profited at one time or another by the practice, and there\r\nis to-day a very general acquiescence in it, save on the part of\r\nunsuccessful candidates whose prospects have been injured by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PROBLEM OF ELECTORAL REFORM\r\n\r\n*347. Scrutin de liste and scrutin d'arrondissement.*--Within recent\r\nyears there has arisen, especially among the Republicans and\r\nSocialists, an insistent demand for a thoroughgoing reform of the\r\nelectoral process. Those who criticise the present system are far from\r\nagreed as to precisely what would be more desirable, but, in general,\r\nthere are two preponderating programmes. One of these calls simply for\r\nabandonment of the _scrutin d'arrondissement_ and a return to the\r\n_scrutin de liste_. The other involves both a return to the _scrutin\r\nde liste_ and the adoption of a scheme of proportional representation.\r\nThe arrondissement, many maintain, is too small to be made to serve\r\nsatisfactorily as an electoral unit. Within a sphere so restricted the\r\nlarger interests of the nation are in danger of being lost to view and\r\npolitical life is prone to be reduced to a wearisome round of compromise,\r\ndemagogy, and trivialities. If, it is contended, all deputies      (p. 320)\r\nfrom a department were to be elected on a single ticket, the elector\r\nwould value his privilege more highly, the candidate would be in a\r\nposition to make a more dignified campaign, and issues which are\r\nnational in their scope would less frequently be obscured by questions\r\nand interests of a petty and purely local character. Professor Duguit,\r\nof the University of Bordeaux, who is one of the abler exponents of\r\nthis proposed reform, contends (1) that the scheme of _scrutin de\r\nliste_ harmonizes better than does that of _scrutin d'arrondissement_\r\nwith the fundamental theory of representation in France, which is that\r\nthe deputies who go to Paris do so as representatives of the nation as\r\na whole, not of a single locality; (2) that the _scrutin d'arrondissement_\r\nfacilitates corruption through the temptation which it affords\r\ncandidates to make to voters promises of favors, appointments, and\r\ndecorations, and (3) that the prevailing system augments materially\r\nthe more or less questionable influence which the Government is able\r\nto bring to bear in the election of deputies.[481] It does not appear\r\nthat in the period 1885-1889 when the _scrutin de liste_ was in\r\noperation the very desirable ends now expected to be attained by a\r\nrestoration of it were realized; indeed the system lent itself more\r\nreadily to the menacing operations of the ambitious Boulanger than the\r\n_scrutin d'arrondissement_ could possibly have done. It is but fair,\r\nhowever, to observe that the trial of the system was very brief and\r\nthat it fell in a period of unusual political unsettlement.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 481: L. Duguit, Traité de droit\r\n                   constitutionnel, I., 375-376.]\r\n\r\n*348. Proportional Representation.*--In the judgment of many reformers a\r\nsimple enlarging of the electoral unit, however desirable in itself,\r\nwould be by no means adequate to place the national parliament upon a\r\nthoroughly satisfactory basis. There is in France a growing demand for\r\nthe adoption of some scheme whereby minorities within the several\r\ndepartments shall become entitled to a proportionate voice in the\r\nChamber at Paris. And hence a second programme of reform is that which\r\ncalls not merely for the _scrutin de liste_, but also for proportional\r\nrepresentation. Within the past two decades the spread of the\r\nproportional representation idea in Europe has been rapid. Beginning\r\nin 1891, the device has been adopted by one after another of the Swiss\r\ncantons, until now it is in use in some measure in upwards of half of\r\nthem. Since 1899 Belgium has employed it in the election of all\r\nmembers of both chambers of her parliament. In 1906 it was adopted by\r\nFinland and by the German state of Württemberg. In 1908 Denmark, in\r\nwhich country the system has been employed in the election of members\r\nof the upper chamber since 1867, extended its use to elections in  (p. 321)\r\nthe municipalities.[482] In 1907 an act of the Swedish parliament\r\n(confirmed after a general election in 1909) applied it to elections\r\nfor both legislative chambers, all parliamentary committees, and\r\nprovincial and town councils. In France there was organized in 1909,\r\nunder the leadership of M. Charles Benoist, a Proportional\r\nRepresentation League by which there has been carried on in recent\r\nyears a very vigorous and promising propaganda. The principal\r\narguments employed by the advocates of the proposed reform are (1)\r\nthat the effect of its adoption would be greatly to increase the\r\naggregate vote cast in parliamentary elections, since electors\r\nbelonging to minority parties would be assured of actual\r\nrepresentation; (2) that it would no longer be possible, as is now\r\nregularly the case, for the number of voters unrepresented by deputies\r\nof their own political faith to be in excess of the number of electors\r\nso represented;[483] and (3) that a parliament in which the various\r\nparties are represented in proportion to their voting strength can be\r\ndepended upon to know and to execute the will of the nation with more\r\nprecision than can a legislative body elected after the principle of\r\nthe majority system.[484]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 482: The first English-speaking state to\r\n                   adopt the system was Tasmania, where, after being\r\n                   in partial operation in 1896-1901, it was brought\r\n                   fully into effect in 1907. By an electoral law of\r\n                   1900 Japan adopted it for the election of the\r\n                   members of her House of Commons. The plan was put\r\n                   in operation in Cuba April 1, 1908, and was adopted\r\n                   in Oregon by a referendum of June 1, 1908.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 483: It is the assertion of M. Benoist\r\n                   that this situation has existed unbrokenly since\r\n                   1881. An interesting fact cited is that the notable\r\n                   Separation Law of 1905 was adopted in the Chamber\r\n                   by the votes of 341 deputies who represented in the\r\n                   aggregate but 2,647,315 electors in a national\r\n                   total of 10,967,000.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 484: Duguit, _op. cit._, argues\r\n                   forcefully in behalf of the proposed change.

Esmein, Droit\r\n                   Constitutionnel (5th ed., Paris, 1911), 253.]\r\n\r\n*349. The Government and Reform.*--During upwards of a decade the\r\nsuccessive ministries of France have been committed to the cause of\r\nelectoral reform. In March, 1907, a special committee of the Chamber\r\nof Deputies (the _Commission du Suffrage Universel_), appointed to\r\nconsider the various bills which had been submitted upon the subject,\r\nreported a scheme of proportional representation whereby it was\r\nbelieved certain disadvantages inherent in the \"list system\" of\r\nBelgium might be obviated. Elections were to be by _scrutin de liste_\r\nand the elector was to be allowed to cast as many votes as there were\r\nplaces to be filled and to concentrate as many of these votes as he\r\nmight choose upon a single candidate.[485] In November, 1909, the\r\nChamber of Deputies passed a resolution favoring the establishment (p. 322)\r\nof both _scrutin de liste_ and proportional representation, but no law\r\nupon the subject was enacted, and at the elections of April-May, 1910,\r\nthe preponderating issue was unquestionably that of electoral reform.\r\nAccording to a tabulation undertaken by the Ministry of the Interior,\r\nof the 597 deputies chosen at this time 94 had not declared themselves\r\non electoral reform; 35 were in favor of no change from the existing\r\nsystem; 32 were in favor of a slightly modified _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_; 64 were partisans of the _scrutin de liste_ pure\r\nand simple; 272 were on record in favor of the _scrutin de liste_\r\ncombined with proportional representation; and 88 were known to be in\r\nfavor of electoral reform, though not committed to any particular\r\nprogramme. The majority favoring change of some kind was thus notably\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 485: The text of the proposed measure, in\r\n                   English translation, will be found in J. H.\r\n                   Humphreys, Proportional Representation (London,\r\n                   1911), 382-385.]\r\n\r\n*350. The Briand Programme.*--June 30, 1910, the Briand ministry brought\r\nforward a plan which was intended as an alternative to the proposals\r\nof the Universal Suffrage Committee. The essential features of it\r\nwere: (1) a return to _scrutin de liste_, with the department as the\r\nelectoral area, save that a department entitled to more than fifteen\r\ndeputies should, for electoral purposes, be divided, and one entitled\r\nto fewer than four should be united with another; (2) an allotment of\r\none deputy to every 70,000 inhabitants, or major fraction thereof; (3)\r\nthe division of the total number of electors on the register within a\r\ndepartment by the number of deputies to which the department should be\r\nentitled, the quotient to supply the means by which to determine the\r\nnumber of deputies returned to the Chamber from each competing ticket;\r\n(4) the determination of this number by a division of the foregoing\r\nquotient into the average number of votes obtained by the candidates\r\non each competing ticket, thus introducing the element of proportional\r\nrepresentation; (5) the making up of tickets in each department from\r\ncandidates nominated by one hundred electors; (6) the restriction of\r\neach elector to a vote for but a single ticket; and (7) an extension\r\nof the life of the Chamber from four to six years, one-third of the\r\nmembers to be chosen biennially. In the ministerial declaration\r\naccompanying the announcement of this scheme Premier Briand declared\r\nthat the effect of the _scrutin d'arrondissement_ had been to narrow\r\nthe political horizon of the deputies; that the electoral area must be\r\nbroadened so that the interests of the nation may be made to\r\npredominate over those of the district; and that, while in a democracy\r\nthe majority must rule, the Government was favorable to proportional\r\nrepresentation in so far as the adoption of that principle can prevent\r\nthe suppression of really important minorities.\r\n\r\n*351. The Electoral Reform Bill of 1912.*--In February, 1911, while the\r\nBriand Electoral Reform Bill was pending, there occurred a change  (p. 323)\r\nof ministries. The Monis government which succeeded maintained, during\r\nits brief tenure (March-June, 1911), the sympathetic attitude which\r\nhad been exhibited by its predecessor, and at the beginning of the\r\nperiod the _Commission du Suffrage Universel_ laid before the Chamber\r\nthe draft of a new bill whereby the details of the proportional plan\r\nwere brought back into closer accord with those of the Belgian system.\r\nDuring the period of the Caillaux ministry (June, 1911, to January,\r\n1912) there was continued discussion, but meager progress. The\r\nPoincaré ministry, established at the beginning of 1912, declared that\r\nthe nation had expressed forcefully its desire for far-reaching reform\r\nand promised that, in pursuance of the work already accomplished by\r\nthe parliamentary commission, it would take steps to carry a measure\r\nof reform which should \"secure a more exact representation for\r\npolitical parties and lend those who are elected the freedom that is\r\nrequired for the subordination of local interests in all cases to the\r\nnational interest.\" During the earlier months of 1912 consideration of\r\nthe subject was pressed in the Chamber and July 10 the whole of the\r\nGovernment's Electoral Reform Bill was adopted by a vote of 339 to\r\n217. At the date of writing (October, 1912) the measure is pending in\r\nthe Senate. The bill as passed in the Chamber comprises essentially\r\nthe Briand proposals of 1910.[486] Through the revival of _scrutin de\r\nliste_, with a large department or a group of small ones as the electoral\r\narea, and with the device of representation of minorities added,   (p. 324)\r\nthe measure, in the event of its probable final enactment, will\r\nlargely transform the conditions under which the parliamentary\r\nelections of to-day are conducted.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 486: The most systematic account of the\r\n                   electoral franchise in France since 1789 is A.\r\n                   Tecklenburg, Die Entwickelung des Wahlrechts in\r\n                   Frankreich seit 1789 (Tübingen, 1911).

ORGANIZATION AND WORKINGS OF THE CHAMBERS\r\n\r\n*352. Sessions.*--By the constitutional law of July 16, 1875, it is\r\nrequired that the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate shall assemble\r\nannually on the second Tuesday of January, unless convened at an\r\nearlier date by the President of the Republic, and that they shall\r\ncontinue in session through at least five months of each year. The\r\nPresident may convene an extraordinary session, and is obligated to do\r\nso if at any time during a recess an absolute majority of both\r\nchambers request it. The President may adjourn the chambers, but not\r\nmore than twice during the same session, and never to exceed one\r\nmonth. The sessions of the Deputies are held in the Palais Bourbon,\r\nsituated in the immediate neighborhood of a group of ministerial\r\nbuildings at the end of the Boulevard St. Germain, directly across the\r\nSeine from the Place de la Concorde; those of the Senate, in the\r\nPalais du Luxembourg. The sittings are by law required to be public,\r\nthough there is provision for occasional secret sessions. Since\r\nJanuary 1, 1907, deputies have received 15,000 francs a year\r\n(increased by law of November, 1906, from 9,000); and they are\r\nentitled, on payment of a nominal sum, to travel free on all French\r\nrailways. The emoluments of senators are identical with those of\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\n*353. Officers, Bureaus, and Committees.*--The presiding officer of the\r\nDeputies is known as the president. He is elected by the Chamber and,\r\nfar from being a mere moderator, as is the Speaker of the British\r\nHouse of Commons, he is ordinarily an aggressive party man, not\r\nindisposed to quit the chair to participate in debate, and therefore\r\nbearing an interesting resemblance to the Speaker of the American\r\nHouse of Representatives. Besides the president, there are four\r\nvice-presidents, eight secretaries, and three questors, all chosen by\r\nthe Chamber. The vice-presidents replace the president upon occasion;\r\nthe secretaries (of whom half must always be on duty when the Chamber\r\nis in session) supervise the records of the meetings and count the\r\nvotes when there is a division; the questors have in charge the\r\nChamber's finances. Collectively, this group of sixteen officials\r\ncomprises what is known as the \"bureau\" of the Chamber. It manages (p. 326)\r\nthe business of the body during a session and, if need be, acts in its\r\nname during a recess.\r\n\r\nEvery month during the course of a session the entire membership of\r\nthe Chamber is divided by lot into eleven other bureaus of equal size.\r\nThese bureaus meet from time to time separately to examine the\r\ncredentials of members, to give formal consideration to bills which\r\nhave not yet been referred to a committee, and, most important of all,\r\nto select one of their number to serve on each of the committees of\r\nthe Chamber. In the case of very important committees, the bureaus may\r\nbe instructed by the Chamber to designate two members, or even three,\r\neach. Thus, the Budget Committee contains three representatives of\r\neach bureau. This committee and another constituted to audit the\r\naccounts of the Government are created for a year. Others serve a\r\nsingle month. Theoretically, indeed, every measure is referred to a\r\ncommittee constituted specifically for the purpose; but practically\r\nthe consequence of such a procedure would be confusion so gross that\r\nthe greater committees, as those on labor, railways, and the army, are\r\nallowed to acquire some substantial measure of permanence. Committee\r\npositions are quite generally objects of barter on the part of party\r\ngroups and leaders.[487]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 487: A. de la Berge, Les grands comités\r\n                   parlementaires, in _Revue des Deux Mondes_, Dec. 1,\r\n                   1889.]\r\n\r\n*354. Procedure.*--Immediately upon assembling, each of the chambers\r\nvalidates the elections of its own members, chooses its bureau of\r\npresident, vice-presidents, secretaries, and questors, and adopts its\r\nown rules of procedure. At an early date the premier communicates\r\norally a \"ministerial declaration,\" in which are outlined the policies\r\nto which the Government is committed; and certain of the measures\r\ntherein proposed are likely to take precedence in the ensuing\r\ndeliberations. The hall in which each body sits is semi-circular, with\r\nas many seats and desks as there are members to be accommodated. In\r\nthe centre stands a raised arm-chair for the use of the president, and\r\nin front of it is a platform, or \"tribune,\" which every member who\r\ndesires to speak is required to mount. On either side of the tribune\r\nare stationed stenographers, whose reports of the proceedings are\r\nprinted each morning in the _Journal Officiel_. The first tier of\r\nseats in the semi-circle, facing the tribune, is reserved for the\r\nGovernment, i.e., the members of the ministry; behind are ranged the\r\nremaining members of the Chamber, with the radicals on the president's\r\nleft and the conservatives on his right.\r\n\r\nOf the bureaus into which, at the beginning of each month, the members\r\nof each chamber are divided, there are, as has been said, eleven in\r\nthe Deputies; in the Senate there are nine. When a bill is         (p. 327)\r\nintroduced it is referred first of all to these bureaus, each of which\r\ndesignates one or more commissioners, who, acting together as a\r\ncommittee, are expected to make a careful examination of the measure.\r\nThe report of this committee is printed and distributed, whereupon\r\ngeneral discussion begins in the chamber. Every measure must pass two\r\nreadings in each chamber, with an interval of five days, unless\r\notherwise ordered by a majority vote. A member wishing to take part in\r\nthe debate indicates his desire by inscribing his name on lists kept\r\nby the secretaries. On the motion of any member, the closure may be\r\napplied and a vote ordered. The division may be taken by a show of\r\nhands, by rising, or by a ballot in which a white voting paper denotes\r\nan affirmative, and a blue one a negative, vote. Voting by proxy, long\r\npermitted, has been recently abolished. No decision is valid unless an\r\nabsolute majority of the members (151 in the Senate and 299 in the\r\nDeputies) has participated in the vote. In the upper branch\r\nproceedings are apt to be slow and dignified; in the lower they are\r\nmore animated, and not infrequently tempestuous. The duty of keeping\r\norder at the sittings falls to the president. In aggravated cases he\r\nis empowered, with the consent of a majority of the chamber, to\r\nadminister a reprimand carrying with it temporary exclusion from the\r\nsessions.[488]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 488: A.

Powers and Functions: the National Assembly.*--Speaking broadly,\r\nthe functions of the French chambers are three-fold--constituent,\r\nelective, and legislative. The first two are required to be exercised\r\nby the two houses conjointly. By the constitutional law of February\r\n25, 1875, there is provided the only means whereby the constitution of\r\nthe Republic may be amended. \"The chambers,\" it is stipulated, \"shall\r\nhave the right by separate resolutions, taken in each by an absolute\r\nmajority of votes, either upon their own initiative or upon the\r\nrequest of the President of the Republic, to declare a revision of the\r\nconstitutional laws necessary. After each of the two chambers shall\r\nhave come to this decision, they shall meet together in National\r\nAssembly to proceed with the revision. The acts affecting revision of\r\nthe constitutional laws, in whole or in part, shall be passed by an\r\nabsolute majority of the members composing the National Assembly.\"[489]\r\nThe power of constitutional amendment is therefore vested absolutely\r\nin the parliamentary chambers, under the requirement simply that   (p. 328)\r\nit be exercised in joint session. The only limitation that has been\r\nimposed on parliamentary omnipotence in this direction is a clause\r\nadopted in an amendment of August 13, 1884, to the effect that \"the\r\nrepublican form of government shall not be made the subject of a\r\nproposed revision.\"[490] As in the British system, constituent and\r\nlegislative powers are lodged in the same body of men; and not merely\r\nthe powers of constitution-making, but the exclusive right to\r\npronounce upon the constitutionality or unconstitutionally of\r\nlegislation. The principal difference is that, whereas the British\r\nParliament exercises the sum total of its powers in an unvarying\r\nmanner, the French, when acting in its constituent capacity, follows a\r\nspecially designed procedure.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 489: Art. 8. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 288.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 490: Art. 8. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 294.]\r\n\r\nOne other function the two chambers sitting conjointly possess, i.e.,\r\nthat of electing the President of the Republic. Under normal\r\nconditions, the chambers are called together in National Assembly to\r\nchoose a President one month or more before the expiration of the\r\nseven-year presidential term. In the event of vacancy by death, by\r\nresignation, or by reason of any other unanticipated circumstance, the\r\nmeeting of the Assembly takes place forthwith, without summons.[491]\r\nElection is by ballot, and by absolute majority of the members. All\r\nmeetings of the National Assembly are held, not in Paris, but in the\r\nold royal palace at Versailles, which indeed was the sole seat of the\r\npresent republican government until 1879. No elective session may\r\nexceed in length the five months allotted to an ordinary legislative\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 491: Law of July 16, 1875, art. 3. Dodd,\r\n                   Modern Constitutions, I., 291.]\r\n\r\n*356. Legislation and Special Powers.*--The two chambers possess\r\nconcurrent powers in all that pertains to the initiation, the\r\nenactment, and the amending of laws, save that money bills must be\r\nintroduced in and passed by the Chamber of Deputies before being\r\nconsidered in the upper branch. Except for this limitation, measures\r\nmay be presented in either house, by the ministers in the name of the\r\nPresident, or by private members. The vast fabric of Napoleonic law\r\nwhich has survived to the present day in France has narrowed\r\nperceptibly the range of legislative activity under the Republic.\r\nDuring the first generation after 1871 few great statutes were\r\nenacted, save those of a constitutional character. In our own day,\r\nhowever, the phenomenal expansion of social and industrial\r\nlegislation, which has been a striking feature of the public life of\r\nmost European nations, has imparted a new vigor and productiveness to\r\nFrench parliamentary activity.\r\n\r\nEach of the chambers possesses certain functions peculiar to itself.\r\nAside from the initiation of money bills, the principal such function\r\nof the Deputies is the bringing of charges of impeachment against  (p. 329)\r\nthe President or ministers. The Senate possesses the exclusive power\r\nto try cases of impeachment. It is given the right to assent or to\r\nwithhold its assent when the President proposes to dissolve the\r\nChamber of Deputies before the expiration of its term. And by decree\r\nof the President, issued in the Council of Ministers, it may be\r\nconstituted a court of justice to try any person accused of attempts\r\nupon the safety of the state.[492]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 492: Y. Guyot, Relations between the\r\n                   French Senate and Chamber of Deputies, in\r\n                   _Contemporary Review_, Feb., 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. POLITICAL PARTIES SINCE 1871\r\n\r\n*357. Republicans and Conservatives.*--In its larger aspects the\r\nalignment of political parties in France to-day dates from the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century. In the National Assembly of 1848--the first\r\nrepresentative body elected in France by direct universal\r\nsuffrage--the line was sharply drawn between the republicans of the\r\nLeft, who wished to maintain the Republic and with it a liberal\r\nmeasure of democracy, and the reactionaries of the Right, who began by\r\ninsisting upon a restoration of clerical privilege and bourgeois rule\r\nand ended, in the days of the Legislative Assembly, by clamoring for a\r\nrestoration of monarchy itself. After the _coup d'état_ of 1851 both\r\ngroups were silenced, though even in the politically stagnant era of\r\nthe early Empire they did not lose altogether their identity. With the\r\nrevival, however, after 1860, of a vigorous political life the two\r\nworked together, and with success, to accomplish the overthrow of the\r\npersonal government of Napoleon III. Upon the collapse of the Empire\r\nin 1870 the original cleavage reappeared. The National Assembly\r\nelected in 1871 was divided broadly into Republicans and Conservatives\r\n(which name gradually replaced that of Reactionaries), and during the\r\nfive years covered by the life of this extremely important body these\r\ntwo great groups struggled continuously over the supreme question of\r\nthe day, i.e., the style of government which should be adopted\r\npermanently for France. Each of the groups comprised a variety of\r\nelements. To the Republicans belonged the Radical Extreme Left of\r\nGambetta, the Left of Grévy, Freycînct, and Loubet, and the Centre\r\nLeft of Thiers and Jules Simon. To the Conservatives belonged the\r\nLegitimate Extreme Right, an Orleanist Centre Right, and, eventually,\r\nthe Imperialists. Following the definite establishment, in 1875, of\r\nthe republican constitution, the lines by which these various elements\r\nhad been marked off grew less distinct, and Republicans and\r\nConservatives acquired in each case a more homogeneous character.\r\n\r\n*358. Rise of the Radicals.*--After the first election under the   (p. 330)\r\nnew constitution--that of 1876--the Senate remained in the control of\r\nthe Conservatives, but the Chamber of Deputies was found to contain a\r\nRepublican majority of more than two to one. From that day until the\r\npresent the Republican ascendancy in the lower house has been\r\nmaintained uninterruptedly; and since 1882 there has been likewise\r\nalways a Republican majority in the Senate. It is to be observed, of\r\ncourse, that Republican control in both chambers has meant regularly\r\nnot the absolute dominance of a single compact party group, but the\r\npreponderance of a coalition of two or more groups broadly to be\r\ndescribed as \"republican.\" During the early eighties there sprang up a\r\nflourishing group which, reviving the original programme of Gambetta,\r\nassumed the name Radical, and in the elections of 1885 this group\r\nacquired such a quota of seats in the Chamber (150) as to render it\r\nimpossible for the Republicans alone to retain control. Thereafter\r\nthere were three principal party groups--the Conservatives and the two\r\nrepublican groups, the Republicans proper and the Radicals. No one of\r\nthe three being sufficiently strong to obtain a majority which would\r\nenable it to rule alone, the politics of a long succession of years\r\nturned upon the adoption of one or the other of two lines of\r\ntactics--the coalition of the two republican divisions to the end that\r\nthey might rule as against a Conservative minority (the so-called\r\npolicy of \"republican concentration\"), and the allying of one of these\r\ngroups with the Right against the other Republican group (spoken of\r\ncommonly as a \"pacification\"). The first \"concentration\" ministry was\r\nthat of Brisson, formed in March, 1885; the first \"pacification\"\r\nministry was that of Rouvier, formed in 1887. In the middle of the\r\nnineties some attempts were made to create and maintain homogeneous\r\nministries. The Bourgeois ministry of 1895-1896 was composed entirely\r\nof Radicals and the Méline ministry of 1896-1898 of Moderate\r\nRepublicans. But at the elections of 1898 the Republican position in\r\nthe Chamber broke down and it was necessary to return, with the Dupuy\r\nministry, to the policy of concentration.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the early nineties, from the Conservative and Republican\r\nextremes respectively had been detached two new party groups. From the\r\nranks of the Conservatives had sprung a body of Catholics who, under\r\npapal injunction, had declared their purpose to rally to the support\r\nof the Republicans; whence they acquired the designation of the\r\n\"Ralliés.\" And from the Radical party had broken off a body of\r\nsocialists of such consequence that in the elections of 1893 it\r\nsucceeded in carrying fifty seats.\r\n\r\n*359. The Bloc.*--A new era in the history of French political     (p. 331)\r\nparties was marked by the elections of May, 1898. Some 250 seats, and\r\nwith them the effectual control of the Chamber, were acquired by the\r\nRadicals, the Socialists, and an intermediary group of Radical-Socialists.\r\nThe Moderate Republicans, to whom had been given recently the name of\r\nProgressives, were reduced to 200; while the Right retained but 100.\r\nThe Socialists alone polled nearly twenty per cent of the total\r\npopular vote. The remarkable agitation by which the Dreyfus affair was\r\nattended had the effect of consolidating further the parties of the\r\nLeft, and the _bloc_ which resulted not only has subsisted steadily\r\nfrom that day to the present but has controlled very largely the\r\npolicies of the government. The first conspicuous leader and spokesman\r\nof the coalition was Waldeck-Rousseau, premier from 1899 to 1902, and\r\nits first great achievement was the separation of church and state,\r\naccomplished through the means of the Law of Associations of July 1,\r\n1901, the abrogation of the Concordat, December 9, 1905, and the law\r\nof January 2, 1907, restricting further the privileges of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in France. A socialist now appeared for the first time\r\nin the cabinet. At the elections of April, 1902, the policies of the\r\nGovernment were vindicated by the return of 321 avowed \"ministerialists\"\r\nand of but 268 representatives of the opposition.\r\n\r\n*360. The Elections of 1906.*--June 3, 1902, the longest-lived ministry\r\nsince the Third Republic was established was brought to an end by the\r\nvoluntary retirement of Waldeck-Rousseau. The new premier, Combes, was\r\na member of the Radical party, and the anti-clerical, radical policies\r\nof the preceding government were maintained throughout the ensuing two\r\nand a half years, as also they were during the premiership of Rouvier\r\n(1905-1906). In March, 1906, a new ministry, in which Clemenceau was\r\nactual chief, was formed with the Radical Sarrien as premier, and at\r\nthe elections which came two months later the groups of the Left won\r\nanother signal victory. Prior to the balloting the majority in support\r\nof the radical policy of the Government _bloc_ could muster in the\r\nChamber some 340 votes; afterwards, it could muster at least 400. The\r\nRight retained its numerical strength (about 130), but the extreme\r\nLeft made decided gains at the expense of the moderates, or\r\nProgressives. The number of Progressive seats, 120 prior to the\r\nelection, was reduced by half; while the aggregate of Socialist and\r\nRadical-Socialist seats rose to 230. On all sides Moderate\r\nRepublicanism fell before the assaults of Socialism. At the same time\r\nit was demonstrated unmistakably that the anti-clerical measures of\r\nthe recent governments were in substantial accord with the will    (p. 332)\r\nof the nation. October 25, 1906, Clemenceau assumed the premiership.\r\n\r\n*361. The Elections of 1910.*--The Clemenceau ministry, which survived\r\nuntil July, 1909, adopted a programme which was more frankly\r\nsocialistic than was that of any of its predecessors. It added to the\r\nsystem of state-owned railways the Great Western Line; it inaugurated\r\na graduated income tax and put the measure in the way of enactment at\r\nthe hand of the Chamber; it carried fresh and more rigorous\r\nlegislation in hostility to clericalism; and, in general, it gave free\r\nexpression to the unquestionable trend of the France of to-day away\r\nfrom the individualism of the Revolutionary period in the direction of\r\nthe ideals of collectivism. The Briand ministry by which it was\r\nsucceeded followed in the same lines, three of its members, indeed,\r\nbeing active socialists. Prior to the elections of April-May, 1910,\r\nthere took place some readjustment of political forces, but, on the\r\nwhole, no change of large importance. The _bloc_, however, more than\r\nonce showed signs of breaking up, and the majority of the party groups\r\narrived at the electoral season devoid of harmony and paralyzed by\r\nuncertainty of policy. The Radicals were divided upon the question of\r\nthe income-tax; the Socialists, upon the question of the party's\r\nattitude toward trade-unions; and all parties, upon the issue of\r\nproportional representation. That the voters were no less bewildered\r\nthan were the party leaders appeared from the fact that in 231\r\nconstituencies--almost an unprecedented number[493]--second ballotings\r\nwere required. With the issues so confused, the results could hardly\r\nprove of large significance. The lines which separate party groups\r\nto-day in France are not infrequently both ill-defined and shifting,\r\nwith the consequence that it is not possible to express party strength\r\nby exact numbers, as may be done in the case of the parties of Great\r\nBritain or of the United States. A deputy may even belong to two\r\ngroups at one time. The composition of the Chamber following the\r\nelections of 1910 can be stated, therefore, only approximately.\r\nComposing the Right were (1) the Right proper, 19; (2) the Action\r\nLibérale Populaire--organized originally to combat the radicalism of\r\nWaldeck-Rousseau, 34; (3) the Progressives, now to be identified with\r\nthe Right, 76--a total of 129. Identified with the Left were (1) the\r\nRepublicans, 73; (2) the Radicals, 112; and (3) the Radical-Socialists,\r\n149--a total of 334. Comprising the Extreme Left were the Socialists\r\n(Independent 30; Unified, 75), aggregating 105. Finally, of\r\nIndependents there were upwards of 20. The continued preponderance of\r\nthe Left was assured, although to prolong their mastery of the\r\nsituation the Radicals and Radical-Socialists fell under the       (p. 333)\r\nnecessity of securing the support of either the Republicans or the\r\nIndependent Socialists.[494]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 493: Absolutely so, save for the _scrutin\r\n                   de liste_ election of 1885.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 494: The political history of the period\r\n                   since the elections of 1910 has been remarkable by\r\n                   reason chiefly of the absorption of public\r\n                   attention by the issues of electoral reform and\r\n                   labor legislation. Embarrassed by interpellations\r\n                   with reference to its ecclesiastical policy, the\r\n                   Briand ministry (reconstituted in November, 1910)\r\n                   retired in February, 1911. The Monis government\r\n                   which succeeded lacked coherence, as also did the\r\n                   ministry of Caillaux (June, 1911 to January, 1912).\r\n                   The cardinal achievement of the Poincaré ministry\r\n                   has been the carrying of the Electoral Reform Bill\r\n                   of 1912 in the lower chamber. See p. 323.]\r\n\r\n*362. Changes since 1871.*--\"The political history of France since the\r\nbeginning of the Republic,\" says a scholarly French observer,\r\n\"presents, instead of an alternation between two parties of opposing\r\nprogrammes, like those of Belgium or England, a continual evolution\r\nalong one line, the constant growth of the strength of parties which\r\nrepresent the democratic, anti-clerical tendency.\"[495] The\r\nfundamental division of Conservative and Republican persists, but both\r\nof these terms have long since lost their original definiteness of\r\nmeaning. The Conservatives have ceased, in large part, to be\r\n\"reactionaries.\" Few of them are even royalists, and the old\r\ndistinction of Legitimist, Orleanist, and Bonapartist has disappeared\r\nentirely. The Right is essentially \"republican,\" as is evidenced by\r\nthe further fact that the majority of its members in the Chamber are\r\nProgressives, whose forerunners composed the real Republican party of\r\na generation ago. The Republican groups of to-day comprise simply\r\nthose numerous and formidable political elements which are _more_\r\nrepublican--that is to say, more radical--than are the adherents of\r\nthe Right. Among themselves, however, they represent a very wide\r\ngradation of radicalism.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 495: C. Seignobos, The Political Parties\r\n                   of France, in _International Monthly_, Aug., 1901,\r\n                   155.]\r\n\r\n*363. French Socialism.*--The history of socialism in France since 1871\r\nhas been stormy. During the seventies proselyting effort was directed\r\nchiefly toward the influencing of the trade-unions to declare for\r\nsocialism. In 1879 the general trade-union congress at Marseilles took\r\nthe desired step, but in the congress of the following year at Havre\r\nthere arose a schism between the \"collectivists\" and the\r\n\"co-operatives\" which in reality has never been healed. During the\r\neighties and nineties the process of disintegration continued, and\r\nthere came to be a half-dozen socialist parties, besides numerous\r\nlocal groups of independents. During the years 1898-1901 continued\r\neffort was made to bring the various socialist elements into some sort\r\nof union, and in 1900 a national congress of all French socialist\r\nparties and organizations was held at Paris. An incident of the    (p. 334)\r\nDreyfus controversy was the elevation of an independent socialist,\r\nÉtienne Millerand, to a portfolio in the ministry of Waldeck-Rousseau,\r\nand this event became the occasion of a new socialist breach. The\r\nParti Socialiste Français, led by the eloquent Jaurès, approved\r\nMillerand's opportunism; the Parti Socialist de France opposed. In\r\n1905, however, these two bodies were amalgamated in the Parti\r\nSocialist of the present day, with a programme which calls for the\r\nsocializing of the means of production and exchange, i.e., the\r\ntransforming of the capitalistic organization of society into a\r\ncollectivist or communistic organization. The means by which the party\r\nproposes to bring about the transformation is the industrial and\r\npolitical organization of the working classes. In respect to its aim,\r\nits ideals, and its means, the French Socialist party, while ready to\r\nsupport the immediate reforms demanded by laboring people, is to a\r\ngreater degree than the German Social Democracy a party of class\r\nstruggle and revolution. In 1885, when the French socialists waged\r\ntheir first campaign in a parliamentary election, the aggregate number\r\nof socialist votes was but 30,000. By 1889 the number had been\r\nincreased to 120,000; by 1898 to 700,000; and by 1906 to 1,000,000. At\r\nthe election of 1910 the popular vote was increased by 200,000, and\r\nthe number of socialist deputies was raised to a total of 105. Within\r\nrecent years socialism, formerly confined almost wholly to the towns\r\nand cities, has begun to take hold among the wage-earners, and even\r\nthe small proprietors, in the rural portions of the country.[496]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 496: The best accounts in English of the\r\n                   French parties and party system are Lowell,\r\n                   Governments and Parties, I., Chap. 2; Bodley,\r\n                   France, Book IV., Chaps. 1-8; and C.

FRENCH LAW\r\n\r\nThe law of France is of highly composite origin. Its sources lie far\r\nback in the Roman law, the canon law, and the Germanic law of the\r\nMiddle Ages. As late as 1789 there had been no attempt at a complete\r\ncodification of it. Under the operation of a succession of royal\r\nordinances, criminal law, civil and criminal procedure, and commercial\r\nlaw, it is true, had been reduced by the opening of the Revolution to\r\na reasonable measure of uniformity. The civil law existed still,\r\nhowever, in the form of \"customs\" (_coutumiers_), which varied widely\r\nfrom province to province. A code of civil law which should be\r\nestablished uniformly throughout the realm was very generally demanded\r\nin the cahiers of 1789, and such a code was specifically promised in\r\nthe constitution of 1791.\r\n\r\n*364. The Code Napoléon.*--Toward the work of codification some\r\nbeginnings were made by the first two Revolutionary assemblies, but\r\nthe development of a coherent plan began only with the Convention.[497]\r\nIn the period of the Consulate the task was continued and progress was\r\nrapid. The governmental mechanism under the constitution of 1799 was\r\ncumbersome enough, but it was not ill adapted to the prosecution of a\r\nproject of this particular character. To a special commission, appointed\r\nby the First Consul, was intrusted the drafting of the codes, and the\r\nultimate decision of difficult or controverted questions fell to the\r\nCouncil of State, over whose deliberations Napoleon not infrequently\r\npresided in person. March 31, 1804,--less than two months before the\r\nproclamation of the Empire,--the new _Code civil des Français_ was\r\npromulgated in its entirety. September 3, 1807, the instrument was given\r\nofficially the name of the _Code Napoléon_. By a measure of 1818 the\r\noriginal designation was restored; but a decree of March 27, 1852,\r\nrevived the Napoleonic nomenclature. Since September 4, 1870, the\r\ninstrument has been cited officially simply as the _Code Civil_. In\r\narrangement the Code resembles the Institutes of Justinian. In     (p. 336)\r\ncontent it represents a very successful combination of the two great\r\nelements with which the framers had to deal, i.e., the ancient\r\nheterogeneous law of the French provinces and the law which was\r\noriginated, or which was given shape, during the course of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 497: H. Cauvière, L'idée de codification\r\n                   en France avant la rédaction du Code Civil (Paris,\r\n                   1911).]\r\n\r\nWith the progress of time certain defects have appeared in the Code,\r\nand since 1871 more than a hundred modifications, some important and\r\nsome otherwise, have been introduced in it. Upon the occasion of the\r\ncelebration, in 1904, of the centenary of its promulgation there was\r\ncreated an extra-parliamentary commission charged with the task of\r\npreparing a revision of the instrument.[498] In the main, the faults\r\nto be corrected are those which have arisen inevitably from the growth\r\nof new interests and the development of new conditions since 1804, in\r\nrespect, for example, to insurance and to labor. In Belgium the Code\r\nNapoléon survives to this day, and the codes of Italy, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Holland, and many of the Latin American states are modelled\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 498: The task of revision has not yet\r\n                   been accomplished. See La Code Civil, livre du\r\n                   centenaire (Paris, 1904)--a volume of valuable\r\n                   essays by French and foreign lawyers.]\r\n\r\n*365. Other Codes.*--Aside from the Civil Code of 1804, containing an\r\naggregate of 2,281 articles, the larger part of the law of France\r\nto-day is comprised in four great codes, all drawn up and promulgated\r\nduring the era of the Consulate and the Empire. These are: (1) the\r\nCode of Civil Procedure, of 1,042 articles, in 1806; (2) the Code of\r\nCommerce, of 648 articles, in 1807; (3) the Code of Criminal\r\nInstruction, of 648 articles, in 1808; and (4) the Penal Code, of 484\r\narticles, in 1810.[499] The last two codes were submitted to a general\r\nrevision in 1832, and various supplementary codes,--e.g., the Forest\r\nCode, of 226 articles, in 1827,--have been promulgated. But the\r\nmodifications introduced since Napoleon's day have involved\r\nprincipally mere details or the addition of subjects originally\r\nomitted. No one of the codes represented at the time of its\r\npromulgation a new body of law. On the contrary, all of them, and\r\nespecially the fundamental Civil Code of 1804, merely reduced existing\r\nlaw to systematic, written form, introducing order and uniformity\r\nwhere previously there had been diversity and even chaos. By the\r\nprocess the law of France was given a measure of unity and precision\r\nwhich it had never before possessed, with the disadvantage, however,\r\nthat it lost the flexibility and dynamic character that once had\r\nbelonged to it. Throughout the past hundred years the whole of France\r\nhas been a country of one written law--a law so comprehensive in   (p. 337)\r\nboth principles and details that, until comparatively recently, there\r\nhas seemed to be small room or reason for its modification. The\r\nhistory of French parliamentary assemblies has been affected\r\nperceptibly by the narrowing of the field of legislation arising from\r\nthis circumstance.[500]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 499: M. Leroy, Le centenaire du code\r\n                   pénal, in _Revue de Paris_, Feb. 1, 1911.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 500: J. Brissaud, History of French\r\n                   Private Law, trans. by R. Howell (Boston, 1912).]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE COURTS\r\n\r\n*366. The Ordinary Courts: Justice of the Peace.*--In French practice\r\nthe distinction which is drawn between private law and public law is\r\nso sharp that there have been built up two hierarchies of courts--the\r\nordinary and the administrative--each of which maintains practically\r\nexclusive jurisdiction within an independent field. The ordinary\r\ncourts comprise civil and criminal tribunals, together with certain\r\nspecial tribunals, such as the _tribunaux de commerce_. At the bottom\r\nstands the court of the justice of the peace (_juge de paix_) of the\r\ncanton. This tribunal was created by the first of the Revolutionary\r\nassemblies and it has existed continuously to the present day. The\r\njustice of the peace takes cognizance of disputes where the amount\r\ninvolved does not exceed 600 francs, and of contraventions of law\r\npunishable by a fine not exceeding fifteen francs or imprisonment not\r\nbeyond five days. In civil cases involving more than 300 francs, and\r\nin criminal cases involving imprisonment or a fine exceeding five\r\nfrancs, appeal lies to a higher tribunal.\r\n\r\n*367. The Courts of First Instance.*--Next above the court of the\r\njustice of the peace stands the _tribunal de première instance_, or\r\n_tribunal d'arrondissement_. Of such courts there is, with a few\r\nexceptions, one in each arrondissement or district. Each consists of a\r\npresident, at least one vice-president, and a variable number of\r\njudges, three of whom form a court with full powers. To each is\r\nattached a _procureur_, or public prosecutor. This tribunal takes\r\ncognizance of all kinds of civil cases. In appeals from the justices\r\nof the peace, actions relating to personal property to the value of\r\n1500 francs, actions relating to land to the value of sixty francs per\r\nyear, and all cases of registration, there lies no appeal from its\r\ndecisions. The jurisdiction of the court in penal cases extends to all\r\noffenses of the class known as _délits_ (misdemeanors), i.e., offenses\r\ninvolving penalities which are heavier than those attached to the\r\ncontraventions dealt with by the justices of the peace, yet less\r\nserious than those prescribed for crimes. When sitting as a criminal\r\ncourt, the court of first instance is known as a _tribunal         (p. 338)\r\ncorrectionnel_, or \"correctional court.\" All of its judgments in\r\ncriminal cases are subject to appeal.\r\n\r\n*368. The Courts of Appeal and of Assize.*--Above the courts of first\r\ninstance are twenty-six _cours d'appel_, or courts of appeal, each of\r\nwhich exercises jurisdiction within a territory comprising from one to\r\nfive departments. At the head of each is a president, and each\r\nmaintains an elaborate _parquet_, or permanent staff of officials, in\r\nwhich are included several _procureurs-généraux_ and _avocats-généraux_.\r\nFor the transaction of business the court of appeal is divided into\r\nchambers, or sections, each consisting of a president and four\r\n_conseillers_, or judges. The primary function of the court is the\r\nhearing of appeals, in both civil and criminal causes, from the courts\r\nof first instance. Original jurisdiction is limited and incidental.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the courts of appeal are the _cours d'assises_, or\r\ncourts of assize. These are not separate or permanent tribunals. Every\r\nthree months there is constituted in each department, ordinarily in\r\nthe chief town thereof, a court of assize consisting of a specially\r\ndesignated member of the court of appeals within whose jurisdiction\r\nthe department lies and two other magistrates, who may be chosen\r\neither from the remaining _conseillers_ of the court of appeals or\r\nfrom the justices of the local court of first instance. The courts of\r\nassize are occupied exclusively with serious offenses, such as in the\r\nPenal Code are classified as crimes. In them, and in them only among\r\nFrench tribunals, is the device of the jury regularly employed. A jury\r\nconsists of twelve men, whose verdict is rendered by simple majority.\r\nAs in Great Britain and some of the American states, the jurors\r\ndetermine the fact but do not apply the law.\r\n\r\n*369. The Court of Cassation.*--At the apex of the hierarchy of ordinary\r\ntribunals is the Court of Cassation. This court sits at Paris, and in\r\nall matters of ordinary private law it is the supreme tribunal of the\r\nstate. It consists of a first president, three sectional presidents,\r\nand forty-five judges. Attached to it are a procurator-general and six\r\nadvocates-general. For working purposes it is divided into three\r\nsections: the _Chambre des Requêtes_, or Court of Petitions, which\r\ngives civil cases a preliminary hearing; the Civil Court, which gives\r\nthem a final consideration; and the Criminal Court, which disposes of\r\ncriminal cases on appeal. It is within the competence of the Court of\r\nCassation to review the decisions of any tribunal in France, save\r\nthose of an administrative character. It passes, not upon fact, but\r\nupon the principles of law involved and upon the competence of the\r\ncourt rendering the original decision. A decision which is overruled\r\nis said to be _cassé_, i.e., annulled. The purpose of the Court of (p. 339)\r\nCassation is not alone to further the interests of justice, but also\r\nto preserve the unity of French jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n*370. Appointment and Tenure of Judges.*--All judges attached to the\r\nordinary tribunals are appointed by the President of the Republic, on\r\nthe recommendation, and under the responsibility, of the Minister of\r\nJustice. With the exception of justices of the peace in France, and of\r\njudges of all grades in Algeria and the colonies, tenure of judicial\r\noffice continues during good behavior; and, outside of the classes\r\nmentioned, no judicial officer may be dismissed without the consent of\r\nthe Court of Cassation. There is, however, an age limit, varying with\r\nthe official grade, at which retirement is expected and virtually\r\nrequired. Justices of the peace and Algerian and colonial judges maybe\r\ndismissed by the President. Salaries range from 1,600 francs per year\r\nin the case of the justice of the peace to 30,000 in that of the\r\nPresident of the Court of Cassation.[501]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 501: The best treatise upon the French\r\n                   judicial system and upon proposed reforms of it is\r\n                   J. Coumoul, Traité du pouvoir judiciaire; de son\r\n                   rôle constitutionnel et de sa réforme organique (2d\r\n                   ed., Paris, 1911). See Vicomte d'Avenel, La réforme\r\n                   administrative--la justice, in _Revue des Deux\r\n                   Mondes_, June 1, 1889; L. Irwell, The Judicial\r\n                   System of France, _Green Bag_, Nov., 1902.]\r\n\r\n*371. Administrative Law and Administrative Tribunals.*--Actions at law\r\narising out of the conduct of administration are brought, not in the\r\nregular courts connected with the Ministry of Justice, but in special\r\nadministrative tribunals connected with the Ministry of the Interior.\r\nAdministrative courts exist for the application of administrative law,\r\nand administrative law may be defined in brief as that body of legal\r\nprinciples by which are determined the status and liabilities of\r\npublic officials, the rights and liabilities of private individuals in\r\ntheir dealings with the official representatives of the state, and the\r\nprocedure by which these rights and liabilities may be enforced. The\r\nidea underlying it is that the government, and every agent of the\r\ngovernment, possesses a body of rights, privileges, and prerogatives\r\nwhich are sharply marked off from those of the private citizen, and\r\nthat the nature and extent of these rights and privileges are to be\r\ndetermined on principles essentially distinct from those which govern\r\nin the fixing of the rights and privileges of citizens in relation one\r\nto another. This conception is foreign to the English-speaking world,\r\nand neither Great Britain nor any nation of English origin possesses\r\nmore than here and there an accidental trace of administrative law.\r\nAmong continental European states, however, the maintenance of a body\r\nof administrative legal principles--uncodified and flexible, but   (p. 340)\r\nfundamental--is all but universal. In some states, as Belgium, the\r\nrules of administrative law are interpreted and enforced by the\r\nordinary courts; but in others, as in France, they are dealt with by\r\nan entirely separate hierarchy of tribunals, made up of officials in\r\nthe service of the government and dismissable at any time by the head\r\nof the state. \"In France,\" as one writer puts it, \"there is one law\r\nfor the citizen and another for the public official, and thus the\r\nexecutive is really independent of the judiciary, for the government\r\nhas always a free hand, and can violate the law if it wants to do so\r\nwithout having anything to fear from the ordinary courts.\"[502]\r\nAlthough not without precedent in the Old Régime, the distinction\r\nbetween ordinary and administrative law in France was first clearly\r\nestablished by Napoleon in the constitution of 1799, and the system of\r\nadministrative courts erected under that instrument has survived in\r\nlarge part to the present day.[503]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 502: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   58.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 503: It need hardly be explained that the\r\n                   First Consul's intention was that the ordinary\r\n                   judges should not be allowed to obstruct by their\r\n                   decisions the policies of the government.]\r\n\r\n*372. The Council of State.*--The most important of the administrative\r\ntribunals is the _Conseil d'État_, or Council of State, a body which\r\nonce possessed large functions of an executive and legislative\r\ncharacter, but whose influence to-day arises almost exclusively from\r\nits supreme administrative jurisdiction. The Council of State is\r\ncomposed of 32 councillors _en service ordinaire_, 19 councillors _en\r\nservice extraordinaire_ (Government officials deputed to guard the\r\ninterests of the various executive departments), 32 _maîtres des\r\nrequêtes_, and 40 auditors. All members are appointed by, and\r\ndismissable by, the President. For purposes of business the body is\r\ndivided into four sections, each corresponding to a group of two or\r\nthree ministerial departments, and a fifth section which deals more\r\ndirectly with questions of administrative law. It is the function of\r\nthe Council to consider and make reply to all questions relating to\r\nadministrative affairs which the Government may lay before it; and in\r\nall administrative cases at law it is the court of last resort. Below\r\nit stands, in each department, a _conseil de préfecture_, or\r\nprefectural council, which is the court of first instance in all\r\nlitigation arising out of the application of administrative law. A\r\nspecialized function of the prefectural council is the determining of\r\nthe validity of arrondissement and municipal elections.[504]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 504: For an account of the administrative\r\n                   law of France see A. V. Dicey, The Law of the\r\n                   Constitution (7th ed., London, 1908), Chap. 12.\r\n                   Important French works on the subject include H.\r\n                   Barthélemy, Traité élémentaire de droit\r\n                   administratif (5th ed., Paris, 1908); H. Chardon,\r\n                   L'administration de la France, les fonctionnaires\r\n                   (Paris, 1908); G. Jèze, Les principes généraux du\r\n                   droit administratif (Paris, 1904); and J. L. Aucoc,\r\n                   Conférences sur l'administration et le droit\r\n                   administratif (3d ed., Paris, 1885). Mention may be\r\n                   made also of E. J. Laferrière, Traité de la\r\n                   jurisdiction administrative et des recours\r\n                   contentieux (Paris, 1887-1888), and Varagnac, Le\r\n                   Conseil d'État et les projets de réforme, in _Revue\r\n                   des Deux Mondes_, Aug. 15, and Sept. 15, 1892.]\r\n\r\n*373. Other Courts.*--Between the hierarchy of ordinary courts     (p. 341)\r\nand that of administrative tribunals stand a variety of courts of\r\nspecial character--courts of commerce, courts of accounts, courts of\r\npublic instruction. There is a _Tribunal des Conflits_, or Court of\r\nConflicts, composed of the Minister of Justice, three members of the\r\nCourt of Cassation, three of the Council of State, and two elected by\r\nthese seven. Under the presidency of the Minister of Justice, it\r\ndetermines, in the event of doubt or dispute, the competent\r\njurisdiction, ordinary or administrative, to be extended to a\r\nparticular case. Finally the fact may be recalled that to take\r\ncognizance of attacks upon the safety of the state, as well as for the\r\ntrial of an impeachment proceeding, the Senate may be constituted a\r\nhigh court of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: DEVELOPMENT SINCE 1789\r\n\r\n*374. Stability of Local Institutions.*--Students of political science\r\nare familiar with the fact that governmental systems are, as a rule,\r\nless stable at the top than at the bottom. Local institutions,\r\nembedded in the interests of the community and supported by the native\r\nconservatism of the ordinary man, strike root deeply; the central,\r\nnational agencies of law-making and of administration are played upon\r\nby larger, more unsettling forces, with the consequence of greatly\r\nincreased likelihood of change. Of this principle the history of\r\nmodern France affords notable illustration. Throughout a century of\r\nthe most remarkable instability in the organization of the central\r\ngovernment of the nation the scheme of local government which operates\r\nat the present day has been preserved almost intact. The origins of\r\nit, it is true, are to be traced to revolution. In most of its\r\nessentials it was created by the National Assembly of 1789 and by\r\nNapoleon, and it rose upon the wreckage of a system whose operation\r\nhad been extended through many centuries of Capetian and Bourbon rule.\r\nOnce established, however, it proved sufficiently workable to be\r\nperpetuated under every one of the governmental régimes which, between\r\n1800 and the present day, have filled their successive places in the\r\nhistory of the nation.\r\n\r\n*375. Local Government Under the Old Régime.*--Prior to the Revolution\r\nthe French administrative system was centralized and bureaucratic, but\r\nheterogeneous and notoriously ineffective. The provinces had ceased\r\nalmost completely to be political units. In but few of them did    (p. 342)\r\nthe ancient assembly of the estates survive, and nowhere did it\r\npossess more than merely formal administrative powers. The \"governments\"\r\nof later times, corresponding roughly to the provinces, had fallen\r\nlikewise into desuetude and the governors had become inactive\r\npensioners. Of political units possessing some vitality there were but\r\ntwo--the _généralité_ and the commune. The _généralité_ was the\r\njurisdiction of a royal officer known as an _intendant_, to whom was\r\nassigned the conduct of every kind of administrative business. The\r\nnumber of _généralités_ in the kingdom varied from thirty to forty.\r\nThe commune was an irreducible local unit whose history was unbroken\r\nfrom the era of Roman dominion in Gaul. Its constitution in the\r\neighteenth century was in appearance democratic. To the communal\r\nassembly belonged all persons who were liable to the _taille_, and\r\nthis body elected communal officers, cared for communal property, and\r\nregulated local affairs. In point of fact, however, the measure of\r\nreal independence which the assembly enjoyed was meager. The\r\n_intendant_ dictated or controlled virtually its every act. Of true\r\nlocal government it may be said that in pre-revolutionary France there\r\nwas little or none.[505]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 505: A. Babeau, La ville sous l'ancien\r\n                   régime (Paris, 1880); A. Luchaire, Les communes\r\n                   françaises (Paris, 1890); H. Barthélemy, Traité de\r\n                   droit administratif (5th ed., Paris, 1908); A.\r\n                   Esmein, Histoire du droit français (8th ed., Paris,\r\n                   1908).]\r\n\r\n*376. The Reconstitution of 1789-1791.*--One of the earlier performances\r\nof the National Assembly of 1789 was to sweep away relentlessly the\r\nadministrative system of the Old Régime and to substitute therefor an\r\norder which was all but entirely new. The communes, to the number of\r\nupwards of forty-four thousand, were retained. But the provinces and\r\nthe _généralités_ were abolished and in their places was erected a\r\nsystem of departments, districts, and cantons. For historic boundary\r\nlines, physical demarcations, and social cleavages only incidental\r\nallowance was made. Eighty-three departments in all were created. In\r\neach there were, on an average, six or seven districts, and in each of\r\nthese an average of eight or nine cantons. The cantons, in turn, were\r\nmade up of widely varying numbers of communes. The most striking\r\naspects of the system were its symmetry and its detachment from\r\nhistory and tradition. Departments, districts, and cantons presented,\r\nand were intended to present, a _tabula rasa_ upon which the\r\nlaw-makers of France might impress any pattern whatsoever.\r\n\r\nFor the time being the ideal of democracy was predominant, and by the\r\nmeasures of 1789, re-enforced by the constitution of 1791, the entire\r\nadministration of local affairs was transferred at a stroke from the\r\nagents of the crown to the elected representatives of the new\r\ngovernmental units. In the department was established an           (p. 343)\r\nadministrative group consisting of thirty-six persons, elected for a\r\nterm of two years, and divided into an executive directory of nine and\r\na deliberative council of twenty-seven. In the district was\r\nestablished a similar, but smaller, elective directory and council,\r\nand in the commune provision was made for the election, under a\r\nbroadly democratic franchise, of a mayor and a council. The canton was\r\nnot employed for administrative purposes.[506]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 506: For the text of the Décret sur les\r\n                   Municipalités of December 14, 1789, see Hélie;\r\n                   Constitutions, 59-72. An English version is in\r\n                   Anderson, Constitutions, 24-33.]\r\n\r\n*377. The Revival of Centralization, 1795-1800.*--Experience proved,\r\nthat in the direction both of democracy and of decentralization the\r\nreformers had gone too far. With the re-establishment of order\r\nfollowing the close of the Revolution proper, in 1795, there was\r\nrevived the rule of official experts, together with the maintenance\r\nover the local administrative organs of a highly centralized\r\nsupervision. The Constitution of the Year III. (1795), while\r\nperpetuating the elective principle in respect to local officers,\r\nreplaced the commune by the canton as the basal administrative unit\r\nand made provision in a variety of ways for the effective control of\r\nlocal affairs by the national Directory.[507] Under the Napoleonic\r\nrégime, established in 1799-1800, the centralizing process was carried\r\nyet further. The canton was reduced to the status of a judicial\r\ndistrict and the commune was restored as the basal administrative\r\nunit;[508] but it was stipulated that the mayor, the _adjoints_, or\r\ndeputies, and the council of the commune should be no longer elective,\r\nbut should be appointed by the central government, directly or by its\r\ndepartmental agents. By law of February 17, 1800, there was\r\nestablished in each department a prefect, appointed by the First\r\nConsul, responsible only to him, and endowed with functions scarcely\r\nless comprehensive than, in the days of the Old Régime, had been those\r\nexercised by the _intendant_. The general council of the department\r\nwas perpetuated, but its sixteen to twenty-four members were\r\nhenceforth to be named for a term of three years by the First Consul.\r\nEach department, furthermore, was divided for administrative purposes\r\ninto _arrondissements_, within each, of which were established a\r\nsub-prefect and a council of eleven members, likewise appointive. The\r\narrondissement represented substantially a revival of the district,\r\nestablished by law of December 22, 1789, and extinguished by the\r\nconstitution of 1795. The sub-prefect served as a local deputy of the\r\nprefect, and one of his principal duties was to assist in the      (p. 344)\r\ncontinuous and close supervision of the affairs of the communes within\r\nhis jurisdiction.[509]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 507: Anderson, Constitutions, 233-236.\r\n                   The canton, suppressed by law of June 26, 1793, was\r\n                   now revived.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 508: The number of communes was reduced\r\n                   at this time from 44,000 to 36,000.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 509: Anderson, Constitutions, 283-288.

From Napoleon to the Third Republic.*--The Napoleonic\r\nadministrative system--simple, symmetrical, bureaucratic, and\r\nabsolutely centralized--has persisted in France, in a large measure,\r\nto the present day.[510] The most important modifications that have\r\nbeen introduced in it are those which have arisen from a cautious\r\nrevival of the elective principle in the constitution of the various\r\nlocal governmental bodies. The fall of Napoleon brought no change of\r\nconsequence, and none ensued until after the revolution of 1830. In\r\nthe days of the Orleanist monarchy, however, the rigor of the\r\nNapoleonic system was in some measure relaxed. A law of 1831 made the\r\nmunicipal council elective, one of 1833 did the same thing for the\r\ncouncils of the department and the arrondissement, and both measures\r\nestablished a fairly liberal arrangement in respect to the local\r\nfranchise. In 1838 the powers of the two councils were materially\r\nincreased.[511]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 510: Its influence upon the\r\n                   administrative systems of other countries--Belgium,\r\n                   Italy, Spain, and even Greece, Japan, and various\r\n                   Latin American states--has been profound. \"Judged\r\n                   by its qualities of permanence and by its influence\r\n                   abroad, the law of 1800 is one of the best examples\r\n                   of Bonaparte's creative statesmanship, taking rank\r\n                   with the Code and with the Concordat among his\r\n                   enduring non-military achievements. If, in the\r\n                   nineteenth century, England has been the mother of\r\n                   parliaments and has exercised a dominant influence\r\n                   upon the evolution of national governments, France\r\n                   has had an equally important rôle in moulding\r\n                   systems of local administration among the nations.\"\r\n                   Munro, Government of European Cities, 7.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 511: The texts of these acts are in\r\n                   Hélie, Constitutions, 1019-1050.]\r\n\r\nAt the establishment, in 1848, of the Second Republic, the essentials\r\nof the administrative system then prevailing were retained. It was\r\nenacted merely that the various councils should be elected on a basis\r\nof manhood suffrage, and that in communes of fewer than six thousand\r\ninhabitants the council should be permitted to elect the mayor and the\r\ndeputies, while in the larger ones appointment should be made as\r\nheretofore by the central authorities. With the conversion, in\r\n1851-52, of the Second Republic into the Second Empire, this\r\ndecentralizing tendency suffered a distinct check. Throughout the\r\nreign of Napoleon III. the communal council continued to be elected,\r\nat least nominally, upon the principle of manhood suffrage; but so\r\nthoroughgoing was the prefectorial supervision that there remained to\r\nthe councils very little of initiative or independence of action. Even\r\nthe privilege which the smaller communes possessed of choosing their\r\nown mayors was speedily lost, while by a decree of March 25, 1852, the\r\npowers of the prefect in communal affairs were substantially       (p. 345)\r\nextended. Many matters pertaining to departmental and communal\r\ninterests which this official had been accustomed to refer to the\r\nauthorities at Paris he was now authorized to dispose of at his own\r\ndiscretion. Throughout the Second Empire the prefect, more truly than\r\never before, was the pivot of the administrative system. Despite the\r\nsurvival of elective councils in the departments, the arrondissements,\r\nand the communes, local autonomy all but disappeared.\r\n\r\n*379. Changes Under the Third Republic.*--Upon the establishment of the\r\nThird Republic the Napoleonic system was discontinued in only some of\r\nits more arbitrary aspects. The National Assembly of 1871 revived\r\ntentatively the scheme laid down in the constitution of 1848, save\r\nthat once again the councils of smaller communes were authorized to\r\nelect the mayors and deputies. Even at such a time of unsettlement,\r\nwhen the liberal elements were insistent upon changes that were\r\nfundamental, there was slender indication of any real desire on the\r\npart of the French people for an essentially decentralized\r\nadministrative régime. At the most, the demand was but for the\r\nautonomy of the commune, while the canton, arrondissement, and\r\ndepartment should continue to be administered by, and largely in the\r\ninterest of, the national government. By law of March 28, 1882, the\r\ndemand in behalf of the communes was met. Upon every commune, large\r\nand small (except Paris), was conferred the privilege of choosing\r\nfreely its entire quota of administrative officials; and in the great\r\nmunicipal code of April 5, 1884, drafted by a commission of nine\r\nconstituted in the previous year, this privilege, with others, was\r\nspecifically guaranteed.[512] Departments and arrondissements,\r\nhowever, continued to be primarily spheres within which the general\r\ngovernment, acting through its own agents, brought home immediately to\r\nthe people the reality and comprehensiveness of its authority. And to\r\nthis day France presents the curious spectacle of a nation broadly\r\ndemocratic in respect to its constitution and central government, yet\r\nmore closely bound by a hard and fast administrative régime than any\r\nother principal state of western Europe.[513]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 512: Text in J.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO-DAY                                        (p. 346)\r\n\r\n*380. The Department: the Prefect.*--For administrative purposes, the\r\nRepublic is divided, first of all, into 86 departments, besides which\r\nthere is the \"territory\" of Belfort, a remnant of the department of\r\nthe Upper Rhine, most of which was acquired by Germany in 1871. Since\r\n1881 the three departments of Algeria have been dealt with\r\nsubstantially as if included within continental France.\r\n\r\nAt the head of each of the departments is a prefect, appointed and\r\nremoved nominally by the President of the Republic, but in reality by\r\nthe Minister of the Interior. The prefect, who is much the most\r\nimportant of all local officials, is at the same time an agent of the\r\ngeneral government and the executive head of the department in the\r\nadministration of local affairs. As agent of the general government he\r\nacts, in some instances, upon detailed instructions; in others, he\r\nenjoys a wide range of discretion. His powers extend to virtually all\r\npublic matters affecting the department. He supervises the execution\r\nof the laws; maintains a vigorous control over all administrative\r\nofficials of the department, upon occasion annulling their acts; gives\r\nthe authorities at Paris information and advice respecting the affairs\r\nof the department; nominates to a variety of subordinate offices;\r\nexercises an oversight of the communes, some of whose measures become\r\neffective only after receiving his assent; and, in certain instances\r\nindicated by law, acts as a judge. He is assisted by a secretary and a\r\n_conseil de préfecture_, appointed by the President. This prefectorial\r\ncouncil, consisting of from three to nine members, advises the prefect\r\nand, in certain cases, exercises jurisdiction as an administrative\r\ntribunal. The prefect is essentially a political official. He owes his\r\nappointment not infrequently to political considerations, and with the\r\nfall of the ministry his tenure is apt to be terminated.\r\n\r\n*381. The Department: the General Council.*--As executive head of the\r\ndepartment the prefect is required to work with a _conseil général_,\r\nor representative assembly, elected by the inhabitants of the\r\ndepartment on a basis of manhood suffrage. This council comprises one\r\nmember chosen in each canton for a period of six years, half of the\r\nnumber retiring every three years. The actual powers of the body are\r\nnot large. Aside from the apportioning of the direct taxes among the\r\narrondissements, they are restricted pretty generally to the\r\nadministration of highways, canals, schools, asylums, and similar\r\ninterests. Questions of a political nature or of a national        (p. 347)\r\nbearing are rigorously excluded from consideration. The council has\r\nbut two ordinary sessions a year--one extending through not more than\r\nfifteen days, the other not more than a month. The longer begins\r\nregularly in August and is devoted to the consideration of the budget.\r\nDuring the intervals between sessions the council is represented by a\r\n_commission départementale_, or permanent delegation, of from four to\r\nseven members. Neither the council nor the delegation possesses any\r\nconsiderable measure of control over the prefect. The council's acts\r\nmay be vetoed by the President of the Republic, and, except when the\r\nnational parliament is in session, the body may be dissolved by the\r\nsame power. The department is an essentially artificial political\r\nunit. During the century and a quarter of its existence it has not\r\nbecome--indeed has been prevented deliberately from becoming--a sphere\r\nof forceful, independent governmental activity.[514]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 514: An administrative reform which\r\n                   appears not infrequently in current political\r\n                   discussion in France is the grouping of the\r\n                   departments into \"regions\" possessing a certain\r\n                   community of character and interest. Each of a\r\n                   score or more of regions might conceivably be made\r\n                   to have an assembly of its own, and within each of\r\n                   them one of the departmental prefects might be\r\n                   given a certain superiority over his colleagues.\r\n                   The principal purpose would be to offset somewhat\r\n                   the nation's present excess of administrative\r\n                   centralization. On this proposal see C. Beauquier,\r\n                   Un projet de réforme administrative; l'organisation\r\n                   régionale en France, in _Revue Politique et\r\n                   Parlementaire_, Nov. 10, 1909.

The Arrondissement and the Canton.*--Next to the department stands\r\nthe arrondissement, or district, created originally in 1799. Within\r\nthe bounds of France there are to-day 362 of these districts. Except\r\nthose in the department of the Seine, and three containing the\r\ncapitals of departments elsewhere, each has in its chief town a\r\nsub-prefect, who serves as a district representative of the prefect.\r\nEvery one has a _conseil d'arrondissement_, or arrondissement council,\r\nconsisting of at least nine members, elected by manhood suffrage for a\r\nterm of six years. But since the arrondissement has no corporate\r\npersonality, no property, and no budget, the council possesses but a\r\nsingle function of importance, that, namely, of allotting among the\r\ncommunes their quotas of the taxes assigned to the arrondissement by\r\nthe general council of the department. The arrondissement is,      (p. 348)\r\nhowever, the electoral district for the Chamber of Deputies, and also\r\nnormally the seat of a court of first instance.[515]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 515: Block, Dictionnaire de\r\n                   l'administration française, I., 256-260.]\r\n\r\nThe canton is an electoral and a judicial, but not strictly an\r\nadministrative, unit. It is the area from which are chosen the members\r\nof both the departmental general council and the council of the\r\narrondissement, and it constitutes the jurisdiction of the justice of\r\nthe peace. The total number of cantons is 2,911. As a rule each\r\ncontains about a dozen communes, though a few of the larger communes\r\nare so populous as to be divided into a number of cantons.\r\n\r\n*383. The Commune.*--The most fundamental of the administrative\r\ndivisions of France, and the only one whose origins antedate the\r\nRevolution, is the commune. The commune is at the same time a\r\nterritorial division and a corporate personality. \"On the one hand,\"\r\nto employ the language of a recent writer, \"it is a tract of territory\r\nthe precise limits of which were defined by the law of December 22,\r\n1789, or by some subsequent law or decree; for by the law of 1789 all\r\nlocal units which had a separate identity during the old régime were\r\nauthoritatively recognized as communes, and since that enactment there\r\nhave been a number of suppressions, divisions, consolidations, and\r\ncreations of communal units. On the other hand, the commune is an\r\nagglomeration of citizens united by life in a common locality and\r\nhaving a common interest in the communal property. A commune ranks as\r\na legal person: it may sue and be sued, may contract, acquire, or\r\nconvey property,--it may, in general, exercise all of the ordinary\r\nrights of a corporation.\"[516]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 516: Munro, Government of European\r\n                   Cities, 15.]\r\n\r\nOf communes there are, in all, under the territorial land survey of\r\n1909, 36,229. In both size and population they vary enormously. Some\r\ncomprise but diminutive hamlets of two or three score people; others\r\ncomprise cities like Bordeaux, Lyons, and Marseilles, each with a\r\npopulation in excess of a quarter of a million. At the last census\r\n27,000 communes had a population of less than one thousand; 17,000, of\r\nless than five hundred; 9,000, of less than three hundred; 137, of\r\nless than fifty. On the other hand, 250 contained each a population of\r\nmore than ten thousand, and fourteen of more than one hundred\r\nthousand. In area they vary all the way from a few acres to the\r\n254,540 acres of the commune of Arles.[517]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 517: A. Porche, La question des grandes\r\n                   et des petits communes (Paris, 1900).]\r\n\r\n*384. The Communal Council.*--Except Paris and Lyons, all communes are\r\norganized and governed in the same manner. In each is a council,   (p. 349)\r\nwhose members are elected by manhood suffrage and, normally, on the\r\nprinciple of the _scrutin de liste_, for a term of four years. The\r\nbody is renewed integrally, on the first Sunday in May in every fourth\r\nyear. In communes whose population is under five hundred the number of\r\ncouncillors is ten; in those whose population exceeds five hundred the\r\nnumber is graduated on a basis such that a commune of sixty thousand\r\npeople has a council of thirty-six, which is the maximum. The council\r\nholds annually four ordinary sessions--in February, May, August, and\r\nNovember--besides which special meetings may be convoked at any time\r\nby the prefect, the sub-prefect, or the mayor. Sessions are held in\r\nthe _mairie_, or municipal building, and are regularly open to the\r\npublic. Except the May session, during which the budget is considered,\r\na meeting may not be prolonged beyond fifteen days, save with the\r\nconsent of the sub-prefect. The normal maximum of the May sitting is\r\nsix weeks.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, the functions of the council may be said to comprise\r\nthe administration of the purely local affairs of the commune and the\r\nformulation and expression of local needs and demands. In the code of\r\n1884 the powers of the body are defined with exceeding minuteness.\r\nSome are purely advisory, to be exercised when the council is called\r\nupon by the higher administrative authorities for an expression of\r\nlocal interest or desire in respect to a particular question. Advice\r\nthus tendered may or may not be heeded. Other powers involve the\r\ninitiation by the council of certain kinds of measures, which,\r\nhowever, may be carried into effect only with the assent of the higher\r\nauthorities. Among the thirteen such measures which are enumerated in\r\nthe code the most important are those pertaining to the purchase,\r\nsale, or other legal disposition of property belonging to the commune.\r\nFinally, there is a group of powers--relating principally to the\r\nvarious communal services, e.g., parks, fire-protection, etc.--which\r\nare vested in the communal authorities (council and mayor)\r\nindependently. But the predominating fact is that even to-day the\r\nautonomy of the commune is subject to numerous and important\r\nlimitations. Many communal measures become valid only upon receiving\r\nthe approval of the prefect, and virtually any one of them may be\r\nsuspended or annulled by that official. Some require the consent of\r\nthe departmental council, or even of the President of the Republic;\r\nand by decree of the President the council itself may be dissolved at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\n*385. The Mayor and his Assistants.*--The executive head of the commune\r\nis the _maire_, or mayor, who is elected by the municipal council, by\r\nsecret ballot, from its own membership, for a term of four years.\r\nAssociated with the mayor is, in communes of 2,500 inhabitants or\r\nfewer, an _adjoint_, or assistant, similarly chosen. In communes   (p. 350)\r\nof 2,500 to 10,000 inhabitants there are two assistants, and in those\r\nof over 10,000 there is an additional one for every 25,000 people in\r\nexcess of the figure named. Except in Lyons, however, where there are\r\nseventeen, the number may not exceed twelve. The mayor plays the dual\r\nrôle of executive head of the commune and representative (though not\r\nthe appointee) of the central government. The powers which he\r\nexercises vary widely according to the size and importance of the\r\ncommune. But in general it may be said that he appoints to the\r\nmajority of municipal offices, publishes laws and decrees and issues\r\n_arrêtés_, or ordinances, supervises finance, organizes and controls\r\nthe local police, executes measures for public health and safety,\r\nsafeguards the property interests of the commune, and represents the\r\ncommune in cases at law and on ceremonial occasions.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the mayoral office are in practice distributed by the\r\nmayor among the assistants, to each of whom is assigned a specific\r\ndepartment, such as that of streets, of sanitation, or of\r\nfire-protection. As a rule, the mayor reserves to himself the control\r\nof police. For the acts of the assistants, however, the mayor is\r\ndirectly responsible, and all acts, whether of the mayor or of the\r\nassistants, which relate to the interests of the general government\r\nare performed under the strictest surveillance of the prefectorial\r\nauthorities. The mayor may be suspended from office for a month by the\r\nprefect, or for three months by the Minister of the Interior; and he\r\nmay be removed from office altogether by order of the President.\r\n\r\nDespite the restrictions which are placed upon it, the commune remains\r\nthe true focus of local life in France.[518] Its activities, on a\r\nsufficiently petty scale though they not infrequently are, run the (p. 351)\r\ngamut of finance, commerce, industry, education, religion, and\r\npolitics. So strong is the communal spirit that public sentiment will\r\nacquiesce but rarely in the suppression of a commune, or even in the\r\nunion of two or more diminutive ones; and, in truth, the code of 1884\r\nrecognized the fixity of communal identity by permitting changes of\r\ncommunal boundaries to be undertaken by the departmental authorities\r\nonly after there shall have been held an _enquête_ and local\r\nsusceptibilities shall have been duly consulted. Save by special\r\ndecree of the President of the Republic, not even the name of a\r\ncommune may be altered.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 518: Among general treatises on the\r\n                   French commune may be mentioned M.

ITALY                                                     (p. 353)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE ERA OF NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n*386. Italy in the Later Eighteenth Century.*--The dominant forces in\r\nthe politics of Europe since the French Revolution have been the twin\r\nprinciples of nationality and democracy; and nowhere have the fruits\r\nof these principles been more strikingly in evidence than in the long\r\ndisrupted and misgoverned peninsula of Italy. The awakening of the\r\nItalian people to a new consciousness of unity, strength, and\r\naspiration may be said to date from the Napoleonic invasion of 1796,\r\nand the first phase of the _Risorgimento_, or \"resurrection,\" may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as coincident with the era of French\r\ndomination, i.e., 1796-1814. At the opening of this period two\r\nnon-Italian dynasties shared the dominion of much the larger portion\r\nof Italy. To the Austrian Hapsburgs belonged the rich duchies of Milan\r\n(including Mantua) and Tuscany, together with a preponderating\r\ninfluence in Modena. To the Spanish Bourbons belonged the duchy of\r\nParma and the important kingdom of Naples, including Sicily. Of\r\nindependent states there were six--the kingdom of Sardinia (comprising\r\nPiedmont, the island of Sardinia, and, nominally, Savoy and Nice),\r\nwhere alone in all Italy there lingered some measure of native\r\npolitical vitality; the Papal States; the petty monarchies of Lucca\r\nand San Marino; and the two ancient republics of Venice and Genoa,\r\nlong since shorn of their empires, their maritime power, and their\r\neconomic and political importance. All but universally absolutism held\r\nsway, and in most of the states, especially those of the south,\r\nabsolutism was synonymous with corruption and oppression.\r\n\r\n*387. The Cisalpine Republic, 1797.*--During the two decades which\r\ncomprehended the public career of Napoleon it was the part of the\r\nFrench to overturn completely the long existing political arrangement\r\nof Italy, to abolish altogether the dominion of Austria and to\r\nsubstitute therefor that of France, to plant in Italy a wholly new and\r\nrevolutionizing set of political and legal institutions, and, quite\r\nunintentionally, to fan to a blaze a patriotic zeal which through  (p. 354)\r\ngenerations had smouldered almost unobserved. The beginning of these\r\ntransformations came directly in consequence of the brilliant\r\nNapoleonic incursion of 1796. One by one, upon the advance of the\r\nvictorious French, were detached the princes who, under English and\r\nAustrian tutelage, had been allied hitherto against France. The king\r\nof Naples sought an armistice; the Pope made peace; at Arcole and\r\nRivoli the Austrian power was shattered. October 16, 1796, there was\r\nproclaimed, with the approval of the conqueror, a Cispadane Republic,\r\nincluding Modena, Reggio, Ferrara, and Bologna; and March 27, 1797,\r\nthere was promulgated for the new state a constitution which, after\r\nhaving been adopted by representatives of the four districts, had been\r\nratified by a vote of the people. This constitution--the first in the\r\nhistory of modern Italy--was modelled immediately upon the French\r\ninstrument of 1795. It provided for a legislative council of sixty\r\nmembers, with exclusive power to propose measures, another of thirty\r\nmembers, with power to approve or reject measures, and an executive\r\ndirectory of three, elected by the legislative bodies.\r\n\r\nIn Lombardy a similar movement produced similar results. Through the\r\nspring and early summer of 1797 four commissions, constituted by\r\nNapoleon, worked out a constitution which likewise reproduced all of\r\nthe essential features of the French model, and, July 9, the\r\nTranspadane Republic was inaugurated, with brilliant ceremony, at\r\nMilan. Provision was made for a directory and for two legislative\r\ncouncils consisting of one hundred sixty and eighty members\r\nrespectively; and the first directors, representatives, and other\r\nofficials were named by Napoleon. At the urgent solicitation of the\r\nCispadanes the two republics were united, July 15, and upon the\r\ncombined commonwealth was bestowed the name of the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic.[519] During the preceding May the venerable but helpless\r\nVenetian republic had been crushed, and when, in the treaty of Campo\r\nFormio, October 17, 1797, Austria was brought to the point of\r\nrecognizing the new Cisalpine state, she was compensated in some\r\ndegree by being awarded the larger part of the Venetian territories,\r\nincluding the city of Venice.[520]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 519: The Cisalpine constitution was\r\n                   amended September 1, 1798, when there was\r\n                   introduced in the republic the French system of\r\n                   administrative divisions.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 520: E. Bonnal de Ganges, La chute d'une\r\n                   république (Paris, 1885).]\r\n\r\n*388. The Ligurian, Roman, and Parthenopæan Republics, 1797-1799.*--In\r\nthe meantime, in June, 1797, the ancient republic of Genoa had\r\nundergone a remodelling. The ruling oligarchy, driven from power by\r\nNapoleon, gave place to a democracy of a moderate type, the        (p. 355)\r\nlegislative functions being intrusted to two popularly elected\r\nchambers, while the executive power was vested in a doge and twelve\r\nsenators; and to the new commonwealth, French in all but name, was\r\ngiven the designation of the Ligurian Republic. The Ligurian\r\nconstitution was accepted by the people December 2, 1797. During the\r\nwinter of 1797-1798 the French Directory, openly hostile to the\r\npapacy, persistently encouraged the democratic party at Rome to\r\noverthrow the temporal power and to set up an independent republic.\r\nFebruary 15, 1798, with the aid of French arms, the democrats secured\r\nthe upper hand, assembled in the Forum, declared for the restoration\r\nof the Roman Republic, and elected as head of the state a body of\r\nseven consuls. The aged pontiff, Pius VI., was maltreated and\r\neventually transported to France. For the new Tiberine, or Roman,\r\nRepublic was promulgated, March 20, 1798, a constitution providing for\r\nthe customary two councils--a Senate of thirty members and a Tribunate\r\nof sixty--and a directory, christened a consulate, consisting of five\r\nconsuls elected by the councils. Within a twelvemonth thereafter\r\n(January 23, 1799), following a clash of arms between the French and\r\nthe Neapolitan sovereign, Ferdinand IV., Naples was taken and the\r\nsouthern kingdom was converted into the Parthenopæan Republic. A\r\nconstitution was there promulgated providing for a directory of five\r\nmembers, a Senate of fifty, possessing exclusive right of legislative\r\ninitiative, and a Tribunate of one hundred twenty.[521]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 521: For an interesting portrayal of the\r\n                   workings of republican idealism in the Neapolitan\r\n                   republic see Fisher, Republican Tradition in\r\n                   Europe, 150-157.]\r\n\r\n*389. Constitutional Revisions.*--During the absence of Napoleon on the\r\nEgyptian expedition the armies of France suffered repeated reverses in\r\nItaly, and by the end of 1799 all that had been gained for France\r\nseemed to be, or about to be, lost. By the campaign which culminated\r\nat Marengo (June 14, 1800), however, Napoleon not only clinched his\r\nnewly won position in France but brought Italy once more to his feet.\r\nUnder the terms of the treaty of Lunéville (February 9, 1801) Austria\r\nrecognized the reconstituted Cisalpine and Ligurian republics, while\r\nModena and Tuscany reverted to French control, and French ascendancy\r\nelsewhere was securely established. September 21, 1802, Piedmont was\r\norganized in six departments and incorporated in the French Republic.\r\nDuring the winter of 1802-1803 the constitutions of the Cisalpine and\r\nLigurian republics were remodelled in the interest of that same\r\nautocratic domination which already was fast ripening in France. In\r\neach republic were established at first three bodies--an executive\r\n_consulta_,[522] a legislature of 150 members, and a court--which\r\nwere chosen by three electoral colleges comprising (1) the         (p. 356)\r\n_possidenti_, or landed proprietors, (2) the _dotti_, or scholars and\r\necclesiastics, and (3) the _commercianti_, or merchants and traders;\r\nbut the legislature could be overridden completely by the _consulta_,\r\nand the _consulta_ was little more than the organ of Napoleon.\r\nIncidentally, the Cisalpine Republic at this point was renamed the\r\nItalian Republic. Within a twelvemonth the new constitutions, proving\r\ntoo democratic, were revised in such a manner that for the legislative\r\nbody was substituted a senate of thirty members presided over by a\r\ndoge, in which were concentrated all political and administrative\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 522: An advisory council of state,\r\n                   consisting of eight members.]\r\n\r\n*390. The Kingdom of Italy (1805) and the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples,\r\n1807.*--The stipulation of the treaty of Lunéville to the effect that\r\nthe Italian republics should remain entirely independent of France was\r\nall the while disregarded. Politically and commercially they were but\r\ndependencies, and, following the proclamation of the French empire\r\n(May 18, 1804), the fact was admitted openly. To Napoleon it seemed\r\nincongruous that an emperor of the French should be a patron of\r\nrepublics. How meager was the conqueror's concern for the political\r\nliberty of the Italians had been demonstrated many times, never more\r\nforcefully than in the cynical treatment which he accorded Venice. No\r\none knew better, furthermore, how ill-equipped were the Italians for\r\nself-government. Gradually, therefore, there was framed a project for\r\nthe conversion of the Italian Republic into a kingdom which should be\r\ntributary to France. Napoleon's desire was that his eldest brother,\r\nJoseph, should occupy the throne of this kingdom. But Joseph, not\r\ncaring to jeopardize his chances of succession in France, demurred, as\r\ndid also the younger brother, Louis. The upshot was that by a\r\nconstitutional statute of March 17, 1805, the Emperor caused himself\r\nto be called to the throne of Italy, and May 26 following, in the\r\ncathedral at Milan, he placed upon his own head the iron crown of the\r\nold Lombard kings. The sovereign's step-son, Eugène Beauharnais, was\r\ndesignated regent. In June of the same year, in response to a petition\r\nwhich Napoleon himself had instigated, the Ligurian Republic was\r\nproclaimed an integral part of the French empire. The annexation of\r\nParma and Piacenza promptly followed.\r\n\r\nAgainst the coalition of Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Naples,\r\nwhich was prompted immediately by the Ligurian annexation, Napoleon\r\nwas completely successful. By the treaty of Pressburg (December 26,\r\n1806) Austria ceded to the Italian kingdom her portion of Venetia,\r\ntogether with the provinces of Istria and Dalmatia.[523] Following a\r\nvigorous campaign conducted by Joseph Bonaparte, the restored Bourbon\r\nfamily was driven again from Naples, whereupon Joseph allowed      (p. 357)\r\nhimself to be established there as king. In 1808 he was succeeded by\r\nNapoleon's ambitious marshal and brother-in-law Murat. From Bayonne,\r\nJoseph issued a constitution for his former subjects, providing for a\r\ncouncil of state of from twenty-six to thirty-six members and a single\r\nlegislative chamber of one hundred members, of whom eighty were to be\r\nnamed by the king and twenty were to be chosen by electoral colleges.\r\nNot until 1815, however, and then but during the space of a few weeks,\r\nwas this instrument actually in operation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 523: The incorporation of Dalmatia with\r\n                   the kingdom of Italy was but temporary.]\r\n\r\n*391. The End of French Dominance.*--Finally, there were brought under\r\ncomplete control the papal territories. Following prolonged friction\r\nwith the Pope, Napoleon first of all (April 2, 1808) annexed to the\r\nkingdom of Italy the papal march of Ancona and the duchies of Urbino,\r\nMacerata, and Camerina, and then (by decrees of May 17, 1809, and\r\nFebruary 17, 1810) added to the French empire Rome itself and the\r\n_Patrimonium Petri_. The Roman territory was divided into two\r\ndepartments, and in them, as in all of the Italian provinces which\r\nfell under Napoleon's rule, a thoroughgoing French system of law and\r\nadministration was established. To all of the tributary districts\r\nalike were extended the Code Napoléon, and in them were organized\r\ncouncils, courts, and agencies of control essentially analogous to\r\nthose which comprised the Napoleonic governmental régime in France. In\r\nthem, likewise, were undertaken public works, measures for public\r\neducation, and social reforms similar to those which in France\r\nconstituted the most permanent and the most beneficent aspects of the\r\nNapoleonic domination. For the first time since the age of Justinian\r\nthe entire peninsula was brought under what was in fact, if not in\r\nname, a single political system.\r\n\r\nIf the rise of French power in Italy had been brilliant, however, the\r\ncollapse of that power was speedy and complete. It followed hard upon\r\nNapoleon's Russian campaign and the defeat at Leipzig. The final\r\nsurrender, consequent upon Napoleon's first abdication was made April\r\n16, 1814, by the viceroy Beauharnais, whereupon the Austrians resumed\r\npossession in the north, the Bourbons in the south, and the whole\r\nproblem of permanent adjustment was given over to the congress of the\r\npowers at Vienna.[524]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 524: For brief accounts of the Napoleonic\r\n                   régime in Italy see Cambridge Modern History, IX.,\r\n                   Chap. 14; B.

THE RESTORATION AND THE REVOLUTION OF 1848                     (p. 358)\r\n\r\n*392. Italy in 1815.*--By the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, June\r\n9, 1815, Italy was remanded to a status such that the name of the\r\npeninsula could be characterized with aptness by Metternich as merely\r\na geographical expression. In essentials, though not in all respects,\r\nthere was a return to the situation of pre-Napoleonic times. When the\r\nbargainings of the diplomats were concluded it was found that there\r\nremained, in all, ten Italian states, as follows: the kingdom of\r\nSardinia, Lombardo-Venetia, Parma, Modena, Lucca, Tuscany, Monaco, San\r\nMarino, the kingdom of Naples, and the States of the Church. To the\r\nkingdom of Sardinia, reconstituted under Victor Emmanuel I., France\r\nretroceded Nice and Savoy, and to it was added the former republic of\r\nGenoa. Lombardo-Venetia, comprising the duchy of Milan and all of the\r\ncontinental possessions of the former Venetian republic, including\r\nIstria and Dalmatia, was given into the possession of Austria.[525]\r\nTuscany was restored to the grand-duke Ferdinand III. of\r\nHapsburg-Lorraine; the duchy of Modena, to Francis IV., son of the\r\narchduke Ferdinand of Austria; Parma and Piacenza were assigned to\r\nMaria Louisa, daughter of the Austrian emperor and wife of Napoleon;\r\nthe duchy of Lucca, to Maria Louisa of Bourbon-Parma. In the south,\r\nFerdinand IV. of Naples, restored to all of his former possessions,\r\nwas recognized under the new title of Ferdinand I. And, finally, Pope\r\nPius VII., long held semi-prisoner by Napoleon at Fontainebleau,\r\nrecovered the whole of the dominion which formerly had belonged to the\r\nHoly See.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 525: By decree of April 24, 1815, these\r\n                   territories were erected into a kingdom under\r\n                   Austrian control, though possessing a separate\r\n                   administration.]\r\n\r\nRespecting the entire arrangement two facts are obvious. The first is\r\nthat there was not, in the Italy of 1815, the semblance, even, of\r\nnational unity. The second is that the preponderance of Austria was\r\nscarcely less thoroughgoing than in Napoleon's time had been that of\r\nthe French. Lombardo-Venetia Austria possessed outright; Tuscany,\r\nModena, and Parma were ruled by Austrian princes; Ferdinand of Naples\r\nwas an Austrian ally, and he had pledged himself not to introduce in\r\nhis possessions principles of government incompatible with those\r\nemployed by the Austrians in the north; while even Victor Emmanuel of\r\nSardinia--the only important native sovereign, aside from the Pope, in\r\nthe peninsula--was pledged to a perpetual Austrian alliance.[526]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 526: W. R. Thayer, The Dawn of Italian\r\n                   Independence, 2 vols. (Boston, 1893), I.,\r\n                   116-178.]\r\n\r\n*393. Foreshadowings of Unity.*--\"Italy,\" wrote Napoleon some      (p. 359)\r\ntime after his banishment to St. Helena, \"isolated between her natural\r\nlimits, is destined to form a great and powerful nation. Italy _is_\r\none nation; unity of language, customs, and literature, must, within a\r\nperiod more or less distant, unite her inhabitants under one sole\r\ngovernment. And, without the slightest doubt, Rome will be chosen by\r\nthe Italians as their capital.\"[527] At the time when this prophecy\r\nwas written the unification of Italy appeared, upon the surface, the\r\nmost improbable of events. It was, none the less, impending, and to it\r\nNapoleon must be adjudged to have contributed in no unimportant\r\nmeasure. In the words of a recent writer, \"the brutalities of\r\nAustria's white coats in the north, the unintelligent repression then\r\ncharacteristic of the house of Savoy, the petty spite of the duke of\r\nModena, the mediæval obscurantism of pope and cardinals in the middle\r\nof the peninsula, and the clownish excesses of Ferdinand in the south,\r\ncould not blot out from the minds of the Italians the recollection of\r\nthe benefits derived from the just laws, vigorous administration, and\r\nenlightened aims of the great emperor. The hard but salutary training\r\nwhich they had undergone at his hands had taught them that they were\r\nthe equals of the northern races both in the council chamber and on\r\nthe field of battle. It had further revealed to them that truth, which\r\nonce grasped can never be forgotten, that, despite differences of\r\nclimate, character, and speech, they were in all essentials a\r\nnation.\"[528] It is not too much to say that Napoleon sowed the seed\r\nof Italian unity.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 527: M. Cesaresco, The Liberation of\r\n                   Italy (London, 1895), 3.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 528: J. Holland Rose, in Encyclopædia\r\n                   Britannica, 11th ed., XV., 48. See also Fisher, The\r\n                   Republican Tradition in Europe, 158-159.]\r\n\r\n*394. Attempted Revolution, 1820-1832.*--From 1815 to 1848 Austrian\r\ninfluence, shaped largely by Metternich, was everywhere reactionary,\r\nand during this prolonged period there was no government anywhere in\r\nItaly that was not of the absolutist type. No one of the states had a\r\nconstitution, a parliament, or any vestige of popular political\r\nprocedure. In July, 1820, Ferdinand of Naples was compelled by a\r\nrevolutionary uprising to promulgate a constitution which was\r\nidentical with that forced in the same year upon Ferdinand VII. of\r\nSpain. This ready-made instrument provided for a popularly elected\r\nparliament of one chamber, upon which were conferred large powers; a\r\ncouncil of state composed of twenty-four members to advise the king;\r\nan independent judiciary; and a parliamentary deputation of seven\r\nmembers elected by the parliament, whose duty it was, in the event of\r\nthe dissolution of parliament, to safeguard the observance of the\r\nconstitution. In March, 1821, revolution broke out in Piedmont and,\r\nafter the mild-tempered king, Victor Emmanuel, had abdicated in    (p. 360)\r\nfavor of his brother, Charles Albert, a temporary regent, the Prince\r\nof Carignano, under pressure, conceded to the people a replica of the\r\nSpanish fundamental law. In both Naples and Piedmont, however, the\r\nfailure of the progressives was complete. The reformers proved to be\r\nlacking in unity of purpose, and when, under authorization of the\r\ngreater continental powers, Austria intervened, every gleam of\r\nconstitutionalism was promptly snuffed out. Similarly, in 1831-1832,\r\nthere was in Modena, Parma, and the Papal States, widespread\r\ninsurrection, and with rather more evidence of a growing national\r\nspirit; but again, with Austrian assistance, the outbreaks were\r\nsuppressed.[529]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 529: Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap.\r\n                   4; Johnston, Napoleonic Empire in Southern Italy,\r\n                   II., Chap. 4; Thayer, Dawn of Italian Independence,\r\n                   I., 215-278.]\r\n\r\n*395. The Revolution of 1848 and the New Constitutions.*--The turning\r\npoint came with the great year of revolution, 1848. During the\r\nthirties and forties, by public agitation, by the organization of\r\nMazzini's \"Young Italy,\" by the circulation of patriotic literature,\r\nand in a variety of other ways, the ground was prepared systematically\r\nfor the _risorgimento_ upon which the patriots and the prophets had\r\nset their hearts. In 1846 a liberal-minded pope, Pius IX., instituted\r\na series of reforms, and the example was followed forthwith by the\r\nprinces of Piedmont (Sardinia) and Tuscany. In January, 1848,\r\nrevolution broke out afresh in Naples and within a month Ferdinand II.\r\nwas obliged to yield to public demand for a constitution. The\r\ninstrument, promulgated February 10, provided for a legislative body\r\nconsisting of a chamber of peers, appointed by the king for life, and\r\na chamber of deputies, elected by the people. February 15 the\r\nsovereign of Tuscany, Leopold II., granted to his subjects a\r\nconstitution of a similar character, making provision for a complete\r\nrepresentative system.\r\n\r\nFebruary 5 the municipality of Turin, voicing a demand in which many\r\nof the nobility and high officials of state concurred, petitioned\r\nCharles Albert of Piedmont for the grant of a constitution. Three days\r\nsubsequently, at the conclusion of a series of secret sessions of his\r\ncouncil, the sovereign announced that \"of his free and entire will\" he\r\nbelieved the time to have come for an extension to his subjects of a\r\nfull-fledged representative system of government, and March 4 there\r\nwas promulgated a remarkable instrument--the _Statuto fondamentale del\r\nRegno_, modelled on the amended French Charter of 1830--which, with\r\nabsolutely no modification of text, survives to the present day as the\r\nconstitution of the Italian kingdom.[530] March 14 there was       (p. 361)\r\nissued by the Pope an instrument known as the _Statuto fondamentale\r\ndel Governo temporale_, by which were constituted two legislative\r\nbodies--a high council and a chamber of deputies--and a council of\r\nstate, composed of ten members and twenty-four advisors, to which was\r\ncommitted the task of preparing measures. Bills passed by the\r\nparliament were to be submitted to the Supreme Pontiff, who, after\r\ntheir discussion in consistory, should extend to them, or withhold\r\nfrom them, final approval. Before the year was far advanced the news\r\nof the overthrow of Louis Philippe, of the uprising in Germany, and of\r\nthe fall of Metternich plunged the whole of Italy afresh in\r\ninsurrection. Under the pressure of popular demand the Pope and the\r\nKing of Naples sent troops to aid the northern states in the\r\nliberation of the peninsula from Austrian despotism, and for a time,\r\nunder the leadership of the Piedmontese monarch, Charles Albert, all\r\nItaly seemed united in a broadly nationalistic movement. July 10 a new\r\nand extremely liberal constitution was adopted by a constituent\r\nassembly in Naples, and, February 9, 1849, following a breach between\r\nthe Pope and the Roman parliament, the temporal power of the papacy\r\nwas once more swept away and Rome, under an appropriate constitution,\r\nwas proclaimed a republic.[531]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 530: The nature of the governmental\r\n                   system provided in this instrument will be\r\n                   explained at length in the succeeding chapter.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 531: G.

The Reaction.*--The reaction, however, was swift and seemingly all\r\nbut complete. At the earliest possible moment the king of Naples\r\nwithdrew from the war, revoked the constitution which he had granted,\r\nand put the forces of liberalism to rout. With the assistance of\r\nFrance, Austria, and Naples, the Pope extinguished the Roman republic\r\nand re-established in all of its vigor the temporal power. By Austrian\r\narms one after another of the insurrectionary states in the north and\r\ncenter was crushed, and Austrian influence in that quarter rose to its\r\nformer degree of ascendancy. Constitutionalism gave place to\r\nabsolutism, and the liberals, disheartened and disunited, were\r\neverywhere driven to cover. Only in Piedmont, whose sovereign, after\r\nthe bitter defeat at Novara, had abdicated in favor of his son, Victor\r\nEmmanuel II. (March 23, 1849), was there left any semblance of\r\npolitical independence or civil liberty.[532]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 532: Elaborate accounts of the revolution\r\n                   of 1848 in Italy are contained in King, History of\r\n                   Italian Unity, I., Chaps. 9-19, and Thayer, Dawn of\r\n                   Italian Independence, II., Bks. 4-5.

The Leadership of Piedmont.*--To all inducements to abrogate the\r\nconstitution which his father had granted Victor Emmanuel continued\r\ndeaf, and the logic of the situation began to point unmistakably to\r\nPiedmont as the hope of the patriotic cause. After 1848 the building\r\nof the Italian nation becomes, indeed, essentially the story of\r\nPiedmontese organization, leadership, conquest, and expansion. Victor\r\nEmmanuel, honest and liberal-minded, was not a statesman of the first\r\nrank, but he had the wisdom to discern and to rely upon the\r\nstatesmanship of one of the most remarkable of ministers in the\r\nhistory of modern Europe, Count Cavour. When, in 1850, Cavour entered\r\nthe Piedmontese ministry he was known already as an ardent advocate of\r\nboth constitutionalism and national unification, and after, in 1852,\r\nhe assumed the post of premier he was allowed virtually a free hand in\r\nthe prosecution of policies designed to contribute to a realization of\r\nthese ends. The original purpose of the king and of his minister was\r\nto bring about the exclusion of Austrian influence from Italy and to\r\norganize the various states of the peninsula into a confederacy under\r\nthe nominal leadership of the Pope, but under the real supremacy of\r\nthe sovereign of Piedmont. Ultimately the plan was so modified as to\r\ncontemplate nothing short of a unification of the entire country under\r\nthe control of a centralized, national, temporal government.\r\n\r\n*398. The Annexations of 1859-1860.*--In 1855 Cavour signed an offensive\r\nand defensive alliance with France, and in 1859 Piedmont, with the\r\nconnivance of her ally, precipitated war with Austria. According to an\r\nunderstanding arrived at by Cavour and the Emperor Napoleon III. at\r\nPlombières (June 20, 1858) Austria was to be expelled absolutely from\r\nItalian soil; Lombardo-Venetia, the smaller duchies of the north, the\r\npapal Legations, and perhaps the Marches, were to be annexed to\r\nPiedmont, the whole to comprise a kingdom of Upper Italy; Umbria and\r\nTuscany were to be erected into a kingdom of Central Italy; the Pope\r\nwas to retain Rome and Ferdinand Naples; and the four states thus\r\nconstituted were to be formed into an Italian confederation. In the\r\ncontest which ensued the Austrians were roundly defeated, but their\r\nonly immediate loss was the ancient duchy of Lombardy. Despite\r\nNapoleon's boast that he would free Italy to the Adriatic, Venetia was\r\nretained yet seven years by the Hapsburgs. Under the terms of the\r\ntreaty of Zürich (November 10), in which were ratified the preliminaries\r\nof Villafranca (July 11), Lombardy was annexed to Piedmont. Years  (p. 363)\r\nbefore (June 8, 1848) a Lombard plebiscite upon the question of such\r\nannexation had brought out an affirmative vote of 561,002 to 681.[533]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 533: King, History of Italian Unity, II.,\r\n                   Chap. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe gain arising from the annexation of Lombardy was in a measure\r\ncounterbalanced by the cession of Savoy and Nice to France, in\r\nconformity with an agreement entered into before the war. In point of\r\nfact, none the less, the benefits which accrued to Piedmont from the\r\nAustrian war were enormous. Aroused by the vigor and promise of\r\nPiedmontese leadership, a large portion of central Italy broke into\r\nrevolt and declared for union with Victor Emmanuel's dominion. In\r\nSeptember, 1859, four assemblies, representing the grand-duchy of\r\nTuscany, the duchies of Modena and Parma, and the Romagna (the\r\nnorthern portion of the Papal States), met at Florence, Modena, Parma,\r\nand Bologna, respectively, and voted unanimously for incorporation\r\nwith Piedmont. During March, 1860, the alternatives of annexation and\r\nindependence were submitted to the choice of the inhabitants of each\r\nof these districts, all males of age being privileged to vote, with\r\nthe result of an aggregate of 792,577 affirmative votes in a total of\r\n807,502. Under authority conferred by the Piedmontese parliament the\r\nking accepted the territories, the formal proclamation of the\r\nincorporation of Parma, Modena, and the Romagna being dated March 18,\r\nand that of the incorporation of Tuscany, March 22. Deputies were\r\nelected forthwith to represent the annexed provinces, and April 2,\r\n1860, the enlarged parliament was convened at Turin. Within the space\r\nof a year the population of the kingdom had been more than doubled. It\r\nwas now 11,000,000, or approximately half of that of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n*399. Further Annexations: the Kingdom of Italy, 1861.*--Meanwhile the\r\nprogramme of Cavour and the king had been broadened to comprise a\r\nthoroughgoing unification of the entire country. With amazing rapidity\r\nthe task was carried toward completion. Aided by Garibaldi and his\r\nfamous Thousand, the people of Sicily and Naples expelled their\r\nBourbon sovereign, and, at the plebiscite of October 21, 1860, they\r\ndeclared, by a vote of 1,734,117 to 10,979, for annexation to\r\nPiedmont. At the same time Umbria and the Marches were occupied by the\r\nPiedmontese forces, leaving to the Pope nothing save the Eternal City\r\nand a bit of territory immediately surrounding it. By votes of 97,040\r\nto 380 and 133,077 to 1,212, respectively, these districts declared\r\nfor annexation, and, December 17, 1860, a royal decree announced their\r\nfinal incorporation, together with that of Naples. January 27, 1861,\r\ngeneral elections were held, and, February 18, there was convened  (p. 364)\r\nat Turin a new and enlarged parliament by which, March 18, was\r\nproclaimed the united Kingdom of Italy. Over the whole of the new\r\nterritories was extended the memorable _Statuto_ granted to Piedmont\r\nby Charles Albert thirteen years before, and Victor Emmanuel II. was\r\nacknowledged \"by the grace of God and the will of the nation, King of\r\nItaly.\"[534]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 534: King, History of Italian Unity, II.,\r\n                   Chaps. 29-32.]\r\n\r\n*400. The Completion of Unification, 1866-1871.*--It remained but to\r\nconsolidate the kingdom and to accomplish the annexation of the two\r\nItalian districts, Venetia and Rome, which were yet in foreign hands.\r\nVenetia was acquired in direct consequence of Italy's alliance with\r\nPrussia against Austria in 1866. A plebiscite of October 21-22, 1866,\r\nfollowing the enforced cession of Venetia by Austria, October 3,\r\nyielded a vote of 647,246 to 47 for annexation. The union was\r\nsanctioned by a decree of November 4, 1866, and ratified by a law of\r\nJuly 18, 1867. The acquisition of Rome was made possible four years\r\nlater by the exigencies of the Franco-German war. The conviction had\r\nbeen ripening that eventually Rome must be made the kingdom's capital,\r\nand when, in 1870, there was withdrawn from the protection of the\r\npapacy the garrison which France had maintained in Italy since 1849,\r\nthe opportunity was seized to follow up fruitless diplomacy with\r\nmilitary demonstrations. September 20 the troops of General Cadorna\r\nforced an entrance of the city and the Pope was compelled to\r\ncapitulate. October 2 the people declared, by a vote of 133,681 to\r\n1,507, for annexation; October 9 the annexation was proclaimed; and\r\nDecember 31 it was ratified by act of parliament. The guarantees of\r\nindependence to be accorded the papacy were left to be determined in a\r\nsubsequent statute.[535] By an act of February 3, 1871, the capital of\r\nthe kingdom--already, in 1865, transferred from Turin to Florence--was\r\nremoved to Rome; and in the Eternal City, November 27 following, was\r\nconvened the eleventh parliament since the revolution of 1848, the\r\nfourth since the proclamation of the kingdom of Italy, the first since\r\nthe completion of Italian unity.[536]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 535: The resulting measure, the Law of\r\n                   Papal Guarantees, was enacted May 13, 1871. See p.\r\n                   388.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 536: For a brief account of the final\r\n                   stages in the unification of Italy see Cambridge\r\n                   Modern History, XI., Chaps. 14, 19.

THE CONSTITUTION                                               (p. 365)\r\n\r\n*401. The Statuto.*--The formal constitution of the kingdom of Italy\r\nto-day is the _Statuto fondamentale del Regno_ granted March 4, 1848,\r\nby Charles Albert to his Piedmontese subjects. To each of the\r\nterritories successively annexed to the Piedmontese kingdom this\r\ninstrument was promptly extended, on the basis of popular\r\nratifications, or plebiscites; and when, in 1861, the kingdom of\r\nPiedmont was converted into the kingdom of Italy, the fundamental law,\r\nmodified in only minor respects, was continued in operation. The\r\n_Statuto_ was granted originally as a royal charter, and its author\r\nseems to have expected it to be final, at least until it should have\r\nbeen replaced as a whole by some other instrument. At the same time,\r\nthere is little reason to doubt that from the outset there was\r\ncontemplated the possibility of amendment through the agencies of\r\nordinary legislation. In any case, there was put into the instrument\r\nno stipulation whatsoever relating to its revision, and none has ever\r\nbeen added. Upon a number of occasions since 1861 possible\r\nmodifications of the constitutional text have been suggested, and even\r\ndebated, but no one of them has been adopted. But this does not mean\r\nthat the constitutional system of Italy has stood all the while\r\nunchanged. On the contrary, that system has exhibited remarkable\r\nvitality, growth, and adaptive capacity. In Italy, as in other states\r\nthe constitution as it exists in writing is supplemented in numerous\r\nimportant ways by unwritten custom, and Italian jurists are now\r\nsubstantially agreed that custom is legitimately to be considered a\r\nsource of public law.\r\n\r\n*402. Legislative Amendment.*--A more important matter, however, is the\r\nextension and the readaptation of the constitution through\r\nparliamentary enactment. In the earlier days of the kingdom there was\r\na disposition to observe rather carefully in practice the distinction\r\nbetween functions and powers of a legislative, and those of a\r\nconstitutional, character. Gradually, however, the conviction grew\r\nthat the constitutional system of the nation might be modified     (p. 366)\r\nthrough the processes of ordinary legislation, and in Italy to-day the\r\ntheory of parliamentary omnipotence is scarcely less firmly entrenched\r\nthan it is in Great Britain. The parliamentary chambers have never\r\ndirectly avowed a purpose to amend a single article of the _Statuto_,\r\nbut numerous measures which they have enacted have, with clear intent,\r\ntaken from the instrument at some points, have added to it at others,\r\nand have changed both its spirit and its application. Care has been\r\nexercised that such enactments shall be in harmony with the public\r\nwill, and in practice they are rarely brought to a final vote until\r\nthe country shall have been given an opportunity to pass upon them at\r\na general election. What has come to be the commonly accepted doctrine\r\nwas stated forcefully, in the session of July 23, 1881, by Crispi, as\r\nfollows: \"I do not admit the intangibility of the _Statuto_. Statutes\r\nare made to prevent governments from retrograding, not from advancing.\r\nBefore us there can be nothing but progress.... If we retain immutable\r\nthe fundamental law of the state, we desire immobility, and should\r\nthrow aside all advances which have thus far been made by the\r\nconstituted authorities. I understand that in the _Statuto_ of Charles\r\nAlbert nothing is said of revision, and this was prudent. But how\r\nshould this silence be interpreted? It should be interpreted in the\r\nsense that it is not necessary to the Italian Constitution that a\r\nconstituent assembly should be expressly convoked, but that Parliament\r\nin its usual manner of operation is always constituent and\r\nconstituted. Whenever public opinion has matured a reform, it is the\r\nduty of Parliament to accept it, even though the reform may bring with\r\nit the modification of an article of the _Statuto_.\"[537] It is in\r\naccord with the principles here enunciated that--to mention but a few\r\nillustrations--the law of December 6, 1865, regulating the\r\norganization of the judiciary, the Law of Papal Guarantees of 1871,\r\nand the measures of 1882 and 1895 overhauling and extending the\r\nfranchise, were placed upon the statute books.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 537: Quoted by G. A. Ruiz, The Amendments\r\n                   to the Italian Constitution, in _Annals of the\r\n                   American Academy of Political and Social Science_,\r\n                   Sept., 1895, 38.]\r\n\r\n*403. Nature of the Constitution.*--The _Statuto_, in eighty-four\r\narticles, is an instrument of considerable length. It deals,\r\nsuccessively, with the Crown, the rights and duties of citizens, the\r\nSenate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Ministers, the Judiciary, and\r\nmatters of a miscellaneous character. The bill of rights contained in\r\nArticles 24-32 guarantees to all inhabitants of the kingdom equality\r\nbefore the law, liberty of person, inviolability of domicile and of\r\nproperty, freedom of the press, exemption from non-parliamentary\r\ntaxation and, with qualifications, freedom of assembly. It is      (p. 367)\r\nconstantly to be borne in mind, however, that, so overlaid is the\r\n_Statuto_ with statutory enactments and with custom, that one cannot\r\napprehend adequately the working constitution of the kingdom to-day,\r\nin respect to either general principles or specific governmental\r\norgans, through an examination of this document alone. In the language\r\nof an Italian publicist, the Italian constitution no longer consists\r\nof the Statute of Charles Albert. This forms simply the beginning of a\r\nnew order of things. Many institutions have been transformed by laws,\r\ndecrees, usages, and neglect, whence the Italian constitution has\r\nbecome cumulative, consisting of an organism of law grouped about a\r\nprimary kernel which is the _Statuto_.[538]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 538: Ruiz, Amendments to the Italian\r\n                   Constitution, _loc. cit._, 57.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*404. Status of the Sovereign.*--The constitutional system of Italy\r\ncomprises, according to the phraseology of the _Statuto_, a\r\n\"representative monarchical government.\" The throne is hereditary,\r\nafter the principle of the Salic Law; that is, it may be inherited\r\nonly by and through males. Elaborate provision is made for the\r\nexercise of regal authority in the event of the minority or the\r\nincapacity of the sovereign. During a minority (which terminates with\r\nthe close of the king's eighteenth year) the prince who stands next in\r\nthe order of succession, provided he be twenty-one years of age, is\r\nauthorized to act as regent. In the lack of male relatives the regency\r\ndevolves upon the queen-mother, and in default of a queen-mother the\r\nregent is elected by the legislative chamber.[539] Upon ascending the\r\nthrone, the king is required to take an oath in the presence of the\r\nlegislative chambers faithfully to maintain and observe the\r\nconstitution of the realm. The monarch is declared to be sacred and\r\ninviolable in his person, and there is settled upon him a civil list\r\nof 16,050,000 lire, of which amount at present, however, the sum of\r\none million lire is repaid annually to the state. Since 1870 the royal\r\nresidence has been the Palazzo del Quirinale, a palace which for\r\ngenerations, by reason of its elevated and healthful situation, was\r\nmuch frequented by the popes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 539: Arts. 11-17. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 6.]\r\n\r\n*405. Powers and Functions of the Crown.*--On paper, the powers of the\r\ncrown appear enormous; in reality they are much less considerable, as\r\nis inevitably the fact wherever monarchy is tempered by\r\nparliamentarism. In the king alone is vested, by the _Statuto_, the\r\nexecutive power, and to him alone this power, in theory, still\r\nbelongs. The exercise of it, however, devolves almost wholly upon a\r\ngroup of ministers, who are responsible, not to the crown, but to the\r\nparliament. In no continental country has there been a more deliberate\r\nor a more unreserved acceptance of the essential principles which\r\nunderlie the parliamentary system of Great Britain. No one of the  (p. 369)\r\nthree sovereigns of united Italy has ever sought for an instant to\r\nestablish anything in the nature of personal government. The principle\r\nthat the ministry shall constitute the working executive, and that it\r\nshall be continually responsible to the lower chamber of Parliament,\r\nhas been so long observed in practice that it is now regarded as an\r\ninflexible law of the constitution. Under these limitations, however,\r\nthe king approves and promulgates the laws, grants pardons and\r\ncommutes sentences, declares war, commands all military and naval\r\nforces, concludes treaties, issues ordinances, creates senators, and\r\nmakes appointments to all offices of state.[540] By the _Statuto_ it\r\nis provided that treaties involving financial obligations or\r\nalterations of the territory of the state shall be effective only\r\nafter receiving the sanction of the legislative chambers. In practice,\r\ntreaties of all kinds are submitted regularly for such approval, save\r\nonly such as comprise military conventions or foreign alliances. The\r\npower of the veto exists, but it is in practice never used. Rarely\r\ndoes the king attend the sessions of the cabinet, in which the\r\npolicies of the government are discussed and its measures formulated\r\nand, save through the designation of the premier, in the event of a\r\ncabinet crisis, and within the domain of foreign relations, the royal\r\npower may be said to be brought to bear in direct manner upon the\r\naffairs of state only incidentally. As head of the nation, however,\r\nand visible token of its hard-won unification, the monarch fulfills a\r\ndistinctly useful function. The reigning family, and especially the\r\npresent sovereign, Victor Emmanuel III., is extremely popular\r\nthroughout the country; so that, although in Italy, as elsewhere among\r\nEuropean monarchies, there is an avowed republican element, there is\r\nevery indication that royalty will prove an enduring institution.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 540: Arts. 5-8. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 5. Dupriez, Les Ministres, I.,\r\n                   292-297.]\r\n\r\n*406. The Ministry: Composition.*--From what has been said it follows\r\nthat the ministry in Italy, as in Great Britain and France,\r\nconstitutes the actual executive. Nominally it consists of heads of\r\ndepartments, although occasionally a member is designated without\r\nportfolio. Of departments there are at present eleven, as follows:\r\nForeign affairs; War; Marine; the Interior; Finance; the\r\nTreasury;[541] Public Instruction; Public Works; Justice and\r\nEcclesiastical Affairs; Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture; and Posts\r\nand Telegraphs. Ordinarily the premier, or \"president of the council,\"\r\noccupies the portfolio of the Interior. He is named by the king, and\r\ninasmuch as, by reason of the multiplicity of Italian political    (p. 370)\r\nparties, there is often no clearly distinguished \"leader of the\r\nopposition,\" such as all but invariably stands ready to assume office\r\nin Great Britain, in the making of the appointment there is room for\r\nthe exercise of considerable discretion. All remaining members of the\r\nministry are designated by the crown, on nomination of the premier. In\r\naccordance with the provisions of a law of February 12, 1888, each\r\nminister is assisted by an under-secretary of state.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 541: Separated from Finance in 1889.]\r\n\r\nAll ministers and under-secretaries possess the right to appear on the\r\nfloor of either of the legislative chambers, and to be heard upon\r\nrequest; but no one of them is entitled to vote in either body unless\r\nhe is a member thereof.[542] To be eligible for appointment to a\r\nportfolio or to an under-secretaryship it is not necessary that a man\r\nbe a member of either chamber; but if an appointee is not in\r\npossession of such membership it is customary for him to seek the next\r\nseat that falls vacant in the Deputies, unless in the meantime he\r\nshall have been created a senator. In point of fact, the ministers are\r\nselected regularly from among the members of Parliament, and\r\npredominantly from the Chamber of Deputies. Only rarely has the\r\npremiership devolved upon a senator. Ministers of war and of marine,\r\nbeing chosen largely by reason of technical qualifications, are\r\nfrequently members of the Senate by special appointment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 542: Art. 66. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 13.]\r\n\r\n*407. The Ministry: Organization and Functions.*--The internal\r\norganization of the ministry--the interrelations of the several\r\ndepartments and the relations sustained by each minister with the\r\npremier--are regulated largely by a decree of March 28, 1867,\r\npromulgated afresh, with minor modifications, August 25, 1876. Among\r\nmatters which are required to be brought before the ministerial\r\ncouncil are all projects of law which are to be submitted to the\r\nchambers, all treaties, all conflicts of administrative jurisdiction,\r\nall proposals relating to the status of the Church, petitions from the\r\nchambers, and nominations of senators, diplomatic representatives, and\r\na wide range of administrative and judicial functionaries. By law\r\nthere is enumerated further an extended list of matters which must be\r\nbrought to the ministry's attention, though action thereupon is not\r\nmade compulsory; and the range of subjects which, upon the initiative\r\nof the premier or that of other ministers, may be submitted for\r\nconsideration is left purposely without limit. It is the business of\r\nthe premier to convoke the ministers in council, to preside over their\r\ndeliberations, to maintain, in respect to both administrative methods\r\nand political policy, as large a measure of ministerial uniformity and\r\nsolidarity as may be; and to require from time to time from his    (p. 371)\r\ncolleagues full and explicit reports upon the affairs of each of\r\nthe several departments. By reason, however, of the multiplicity of\r\nparty groups in the chambers, the necessarily composite character\r\npolitically of every cabinet, and the generally unstable political\r\ncondition of the country, ministries rarely possess much real unity,\r\nand in the administration of the public business they are likely to be\r\nhandicapped by internal friction. \"The Italian ministry,\" says an able\r\nFrench writer, \"is manifestly unable to fulfill effectively the\r\nthree-fold purpose of a parliamentary cabinet. It exercises the\r\nexecutive power in the name, and under the authority, of the king; but\r\nit does not always know how to restrain Parliament within the bounds\r\nof its proper control, and it is obliged to tolerate the interference\r\nof deputies in the administration. Through the employment of the\r\ninitiative, and of influence upon the acts of Parliament, it is the\r\npower which impels legislation; but not infrequently it is lacking in\r\nthe authority essential to push through the reforms which it has\r\nundertaken, and the Chamber evades easily its control. It seeks to\r\nmaintain harmony between the two powers (executive and legislative);\r\nbut the repeated defeats which it suffers demonstrate to what a degree\r\nits work is impeded by the disorganization of parties.\"[543] For all\r\nof their acts the ministers are responsible directly to Parliament,\r\nwhich means, in effect, to the Chamber of Deputies; and no law or\r\ngovernmental measure may be put in operation until it has received the\r\nsignature of one or more of the ministerial group, by whom\r\nresponsibility for it is thereby explicitly assumed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 543: Dupriez, Les Ministres, I., 291.]\r\n\r\n*408. The Promulgation of Ordinances.*--The administrative system of\r\nItaly is modelled, in the main, upon that of France. In the effort to\r\nachieve national homogeneity the founders of the kingdom indulged to\r\nexcess their propensity for centralization, with the consequence that\r\nItaly has exhibited regularly an admixture of bureaucracy and\r\nliberalism even more confounding than that which prevails in the\r\nFrench Republic. In theory the administrative system is broadly\r\ndemocratic and tolerant; in practice it not infrequently lends itself\r\nto the employment of the most arbitrary devices. Abuse arises most\r\ncommonly from the powers vested in the administrative officials to\r\nsupplement legislation through the promulgation and enforcement of\r\nordinances. By the constitution it is stipulated that the Executive\r\nshall \"make decrees and regulations necessary for the execution of the\r\nlaws, without suspending their execution, or granting exemptions from\r\nthem.\"[544] This power, however, in practice, is stretched even\r\nfurther than is the similar power of the Executive in France, and with\r\nthe result not infrequently of the creation of temporary law, or   (p. 372)\r\neven the virtual negation of parliamentary enactment. Parliament is\r\nseldom disposed to stand very rigidly upon its rights; indeed, it\r\nsometimes delegates expressly to the ministry the exercise of sweeping\r\nlegislative authority. The final text of the great electoral law of\r\n1882, for example, was never considered in the chambers at all. After\r\ndebating the subject to their satisfaction, the two houses simply\r\ncommitted to the Government the task of drawing up a permanent draft\r\nof the measure and of promulgating it by executive decree. The same\r\nprocedure has been followed in other fundamental matters. And not\r\nmerely the ministers at Rome, but also the local administrative\r\nagents, exercise with freedom the ordinance-making prerogative. \"The\r\npreference, indeed,\" as is observed by Lowell, \"for administrative\r\nregulations, which the government can change at any time, over rigid\r\nstatutes is deeply implanted in the Latin races, and seems to be\r\nespecially marked in Italy.\"[545]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 544: Art. 6. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 5.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 545: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   166.

PARLIAMENT: THE SENATE\r\n\r\n*409. Composition.*--Legislative power in Italy is vested conjointly in\r\nthe king and Parliament, the latter consisting of two houses--an\r\nupper, the _Senato_, and a lower, _the Camera de' Deputati_. The\r\nSenate is composed entirely of members appointed for life by the\r\ncrown. The body is no true sense a house of peers. Its seats are not\r\nhereditary and its members represent not alone the great proprietors\r\nof the country but a wide variety of public functionaries and men of\r\nachievement. In the making of appointments the sovereign is restricted\r\nby the necessity of taking all appointees from twenty-one stipulated\r\nclasses of citizens, and it is required that senators shall be of a\r\nminimum age of forty years. The categories from which appointments are\r\nmade--including high ecclesiastics, ministers of state, ambassadors,\r\ndeputies of prolonged service, legal and administrative officials, men\r\nwho during as much as seven years have been members of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences or of the Superior Council of Public\r\nInstruction--may be reduced, broadly, to three: (1) high officials of\r\nchurch and state; (2) persons of fame in science or literature, or who\r\nby any kind of services or merit have brought distinction to the\r\ncountry; and (3) persons who for at least three years have paid direct\r\nproperty or business taxes to the amount of 3000 lire ($600). The\r\ntotal number of members when the _Statuto_ was put in effect in 1848\r\nwas 78; the number in 1910 was 383. The last-mentioned number comprised\r\nthe president of the Chamber of Deputies, 147 ex-deputies of six   (p. 373)\r\nyears' service (or men who had been elected to as many as three\r\nparliaments), one minister of state, six secretaries of state, five\r\nambassadors, two envoys extraordinary, 23 officials of the courts of\r\ncassation and of other tribunals, 33 military and naval officials,\r\neight councillors of state, 21 provincial functionaries, 41 members of\r\nthe Royal Academy of Sciences, three members of the Superior Council\r\nof Public Instruction, two persons of distinguished services to the\r\ncountry, 71 payers of direct taxes in the amount of 3,000 lire, and 19\r\nother scattered representatives of several categories. The absence of\r\necclesiastical dignitaries is to be accounted for by the rupture with\r\nthe Vatican. The last members of this class to be named were appointed\r\nin 1866.\r\n\r\n*410. Legislative Weakness.*--The prerogative of senatorial appointment\r\nhas been exercised upon several occasions for the specific purpose of\r\ninfluencing the political complexion of the upper chamber. In 1886\r\nforty-one appointments were made at one stroke; in 1890, seventy-five;\r\nand in 1892, forty-two. The Senate guards jealously its right to\r\ndetermine whether an appointee is properly to be considered as\r\nbelonging to any one of the twenty-one stipulated categories, and if\r\nit decides that he is not thus eligible, he is refused a seat. But as\r\nlong as the sovereign keeps clearly within the enumerated classes, no\r\npractical limitation can be placed upon his power of appointment.[546]\r\nIn practice, appointment by the king has meant regularly appointment\r\nby the ministry commanding a majority in the lower chamber; and so\r\neasy and so effective has proved the process of \"swamping\" that the\r\nlegislative independence of the Senate has been reduced almost to a\r\nnullity. In general it may be said that the body exercises the\r\nfunction of a revising, but no longer of an initiating or a checking,\r\nchamber. During the period 1861-1910 the government presented in the\r\nChamber of Deputies a total of 7,569 legislative proposals, in the\r\nSenate but 598; and the number of projects of law originated within\r\nthe Senate during this same period was but thirty-nine. In volume and\r\nrange of legislative activity the nominated senate of Italy is\r\ndistinctly inferior to the elected senate of France.[547]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 546: Of 1,528 appointments made between\r\n                   1848 and 1910 but 63 were refused confirmation by\r\n                   the Senate.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 547: It is interesting to observe that,\r\n                   in the interest of governmental stability and\r\n                   permanence, Cavour favored the adoption of the\r\n                   elective principle in Italy. For illustrations of\r\n                   the weakness of the Italian Senate see C.\r\n                   Morizot-Thibault, Des droits des chambres hautes ou\r\n                   sénats en matière des lois de finance (Paris,\r\n                   1891), 156-175.]\r\n\r\n*411. Projected Reform.*--Within recent years there has arisen a\r\npersistent demand for a reform of the Senate, to the end that the\r\nbody may be brought into closer touch with the people and be       (p. 374)\r\nrestored to the position of a vigorous and useful second chamber. In\r\nthe spring of 1910 the subject was discussed at some length within the\r\nSenate itself, and at the suggestion of the ministry a special\r\ncommission of nine members was created to study \"the timeliness, the\r\nmethod, and the extent\" of the proposed reforms. December 5, 1910,\r\nthis commission brought in an elaborate report, written principally by\r\nSenator Arcoleo, a leader among Italian authorities upon\r\nconstitutional law. After pointing out that among European nations the\r\nreconstitution and modernization of upper chambers is a subject of\r\nlarge current interest, the commission proposed a carefully considered\r\nscheme for the popularizing and strengthening of the senatorial body.\r\nThe substance of the plan was, in brief; (1) that the chamber\r\nhenceforth should be composed of 350 members; (2) that the membership\r\nshould be divided into three categories, designated, respectively, as\r\nofficials, men of science and education, and men of political or\r\neconomic status; and (3) that members of the first category, not to\r\nexceed 120, should be appointed, as are all members at present, by the\r\ncrown; but members of the other two should be elected by fifteen\r\nspecial colleges so constituted that their membership would represent\r\nactual and varied groups of interests throughout the nation. The\r\nprofessors in the universities, for example, organized for the purpose\r\nas an electoral college, should be authorized to choose a contingent\r\nof thirty representatives. Other elements to be admitted to a definite\r\nparticipation in the elections should include former deputies, larger\r\ntaxpayers, provincial and communal assemblies, chambers of commerce,\r\nagricultural societies, and workingmen's associations. The primary\r\nidea of those who propounded the scheme was that through its adoption\r\nthere would be established a more vital contact between the Senate and\r\nthe varied forces that contribute to the life of the nation than can\r\nsubsist under the existing order. Unfortunately, as many consider, the\r\nSenate voted not to approve the commission's project. It contented\r\nitself, rather, with a vote in favor of an enlargement of the classes\r\nof citizens from which senators may be appointed by the king,\r\nalthough, in February, 1911, it went so far as to request the ministry\r\nto present new proposals, and, in particular, a proposal to vest in\r\nthe Senate the choice of its presiding officer. Toward a solution of\r\nthe problems involved there has been (to 1912) no further progress. It\r\nis not improbable, however, that upon some such plan of modernization\r\nas was prepared by the commission of 1910 agreement eventually will be\r\nreached.[548]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 548: E.

Privileges and Powers.*--Within the Senate, as to-day        (p. 375)\r\nconstituted, the president and vice-president are named by the king;\r\nthe secretaries are selected by the body from its own membership. The\r\nprivileges of members are defined minutely. Save by order of the\r\nSenate itself, no senator may be arrested, unless apprehended in the\r\ncommission of an offense; and the Senate is constituted sole judge of\r\nthe alleged misdemeanors of its members--a curious duplication of an\r\nancient prerogative of the British House of Lords. Ministers are\r\nresponsible only to the lower house, and although there are instances\r\nin which a minister has retired by reason of an adverse vote in the\r\nSenate, in general it may be affirmed that the Senate's importance in\r\nthe parliamentary régime is distinctly subordinate. The two chambers\r\npossess concurrent powers of legislation, except that all measures\r\nimposing taxes or relating to the budget are required to be presented\r\nfirst in the Deputies. By decree of the crown the Senate may be\r\nconstituted a High Court of Justice to try cases involving treason or\r\nattempts upon the safety of the state, and to try ministers impeached\r\nby the Chamber of Deputies. When acting in this capacity the body is a\r\ntribunal of justice, not a political organization; but it is forbidden\r\nto occupy itself with any judicial matters other than those for which\r\nit was convened.[549]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 549: Art. 36. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES--PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE\r\n\r\n*413. Composition: Franchise Law of 1882.*--The lower legislative\r\nchamber is composed of 508 members chosen by the voters of the realm\r\nunder the provisions of the electoral law of March 28, 1895. In no\r\ncountry of western Europe is the privilege of the franchise more\r\nrestricted than in Italy; yet progress toward a broadly democratic\r\nscheme of suffrage has been steady and apparently as rapid as\r\nconditions have warranted. The history of the franchise since the\r\nestablishment of the present kingdom falls into three periods,\r\ndelimited by the electoral laws of 1882 and 1895. Prior to 1882 the\r\nfranchise was, in the main, that established by the electoral law of\r\nDecember 17, 1860, modified by amendments of July, 1875, and May,\r\n1877. It was restricted to property-holders who were able to read and\r\nwrite, who had attained the age of twenty-five, and who paid an annual\r\ntax of at least forty lire. Under this system less than two and a  (p. 376)\r\nhalf per cent of the population possessed the right to vote.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, after prolonged consideration of the subject, the Government\r\ncarried through Parliament a series of measures--co-ordinated in the\r\nroyal decree of September 24--by which the property qualification was\r\nreduced from forty lire to nineteen lire eighty centesimi and the age\r\nlimit was lowered to twenty-one years. The disqualification of\r\nilliteracy was retained, and a premium was placed upon literacy by the\r\nextension of the franchise, regardless of property, to all males over\r\ntwenty-one who had received a primary school education. There were\r\nminor extensions in other directions. The net result of the law of\r\n1882 was to raise the number of voters at a stroke from 627,838 to\r\n2,049,461, about two-thirds of the new voters obtaining the franchise\r\nby reason of their ability to meet the educational qualification.[550]\r\nAn incidental effect of the reform was to augment the political\r\ninfluence of the cities, because in them the proportion of illiterates\r\nwas smaller than in the country districts. Small landed proprietors,\r\nthough of a more conservative temperament, and not infrequently of a\r\nbetter economic status, than the urban artisans, were commonly unable\r\nto fulfill the scholarship qualification.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 550: Lowell, Governments and Parties, I.,\r\n                   157.]\r\n\r\nThe law of 1882 provided for elections by general ticket, i.e., on the\r\nprinciple of _scrutinio di lista_. An act of May 8, 1891, abolished\r\nthe general ticket and created a commission by which the country was\r\ndivided into 508 electoral districts, each entitled to choose one\r\ndeputy. By a law of June 28, 1892, there were introduced various\r\nreforms in the control and supervision of elections, and by another of\r\nJuly 11, 1894, new provisions were established for the revision of\r\nelectoral and registration lists. Finally, March 28, 1895, there was\r\npromulgated an elaborate royal decree whereby the entire body of\r\nelectoral laws enacted since the establishment of constitutional\r\ngovernment, and at the time continuing in operation, was co-ordinated\r\nafresh. The existing system was not altered fundamentally, although\r\nthe method of making up the voting-lists was changed, with the result\r\nthat the number of electors was somewhat diminished.\r\n\r\n*414. The Franchise To-day.*--The Italian voter to-day must possess the\r\nfollowing qualifications: (1) Italian citizenship; (2) age of\r\ntwenty-one, or over; (3) ability to read and write; and (4) successful\r\npassage of examinations in the subjects comprised in the course of\r\ncompulsory elementary education. The last-mentioned qualification is\r\nnot, however, required of officials, graduates of colleges, professional\r\nmen, persons who have served two years in the army, citizens who pay a\r\ndirect tax annually of not less than nineteen lire eighty          (p. 377)\r\ncentesimi, those who pay an agricultural rental of 500 lire, those who\r\npay house rent of from 150 lire in communes of 2,500 people to 400\r\nlire in communes of over 150,000, and certain less important classes.\r\nSo serious at all times has seemed the menace of illiteracy in Italy\r\nthat the establishment of manhood suffrage has but rarely been\r\nproposed. Under the existing system the extension of education carries\r\nwith it automatically the expansion of the franchise, though the\r\nobstacles to universal education are still so formidable that the\r\ndemocratizing of the state proceeds but slowly.[551] In 1904 the\r\nnumber of enrolled electors was 2,541,327--29 per cent of the male\r\npopulation over twenty-one years of age, and 7.67 per cent of the total\r\npopulation--exclusive of 26,056 electors temporarily disfranchised by\r\nreason of being engaged in active military service. At the elections\r\nof November, 1904, the number of qualified electors who voted was\r\n1,593,886, or but 62.7 per cent of those who possessed the privilege.\r\nThe proportion of registered electors who actually vote is kept down\r\nby the prosaic character of Italian electoral campaigns, by the\r\ninfluence of the papal _Non Expedite_,[552] and, most of all, by the\r\nhabitual indifference of citizens, who, if the truth be told, for the\r\nmost part have never displayed an insatiable yearning for the\r\npossession of the voting privilege. With the exception of the\r\nSocialists, no party has a clear-cut, continuous programme; none, save\r\nagain the socialists, attempts systematically to arouse the voters at\r\nelection time.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 551: King and Okey, Italy To-day, Chap.\r\n                   12.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 552: See p. 400.]\r\n\r\n*415. Electoral Reform.*--Notwithstanding these facts, there has been,\r\nin recent years, a somewhat insistent demand for electoral reform. The\r\nLuzzatti ministry fell, in March, 1911, primarily because a plan of\r\nsuffrage extension which it had proposed was not to be put in\r\noperation before 1913. June 10, 1911, the Giolitti ministry which\r\nsucceeded laid before the Chamber the text of a measure which, if\r\nadopted, would go far toward the establishment of universal male\r\nsuffrage. The proposal was that practically all male citizens over\r\nthirty years of age, and all over twenty-one who have performed the\r\nmilitary service required by the state, should be given the privilege\r\nof voting, irrespective of their ability to read and write. This\r\nproject, after being debated at length, was adopted in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies early in 1912 by the enormous majority of 392 to 61. In the\r\nevent of its final enactment the existing electorate will be increased\r\nfrom three millions to two and a half times that number and a general\r\noverhauling of electoral methods and machinery will be rendered\r\nnecessary. The grounds upon which the change is urged are, first,  (p. 378)\r\nthe example of other nations and, second, the political and economic\r\nprogress which Italy has achieved within the past generation. Serious\r\nstudents doubt whether the time is ripe for so radical a step. One\r\nhalf of the proposed electorate would be wholly illiterate.[553]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 553: For the text of the Giolitti\r\n                   proposals see _Il Seculo_, June 11, 1911.

(Rome, 1912).]\r\n\r\n*416. Electoral Procedure.*--Save during the years 1882-91, when the\r\n_scrutinio di lista_ was in operation, deputies have been chosen\r\nuniformly from single-member districts. There are to-day 508 such\r\ndistricts. No candidate is returned unless he not only polls a number\r\nof votes in excess of one-sixth of the total number of enrolled\r\nelectors within the district, but has also an absolute majority of all\r\nthe votes cast. If, after balloting, it is found that no candidate\r\nmeets this requirement, a second ballot (_ballottaggio_) takes place\r\none week subsequently.[554] At each polling place the presiding\r\nofficer and \"scrutineers\" are chosen by the voters present. The method\r\nof voting is simple. In the polling-booth stands a table, on which are\r\nplaced two square glass boxes, one empty, the other containing the\r\nvoting papers. As the list of enrolled electors is read\r\nalphabetically, each man steps forward, receives a ballot paper, takes\r\nit to an adjoining table and writes on it the name of the candidate\r\nfor whom he wishes to vote, folds the paper, and deposits it in the\r\nbox reserved for the purpose. After the list has been read through it\r\nis the right of any voter who was not present to respond when his name\r\nwas called to cast his ballot in a similar manner. The polling hours\r\nextend, as a rule, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.[555]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 554: At the elections of March, 1909, in\r\n                   75 of the 508 districts no candidate received an\r\n                   adequate majority. In 57 of these districts the\r\n                   candidate who, at the first ballot, had received\r\n                   the largest number of votes was elected at the\r\n                   second ballot. The political effect of the second\r\n                   ballot is slight. At the election of 1900 there\r\n                   were 77 second ballotings; at that of 1904, 39.

Locatelli, Considerazioni intorno all'\r\n                   opportunità di abolire il ballottaggio, in _La\r\n                   Riforma Sociale_, July-Aug., 1910.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 555: King and Okey, Italy To-day, 14.]\r\n\r\n*417. Qualifications and Privileges of Members.*--A deputy is not\r\nrequired to be a resident of the district from which he is chosen. He\r\nmust, however, be a citizen; must be at least thirty years of age;\r\nmust be in possession of full civil and political rights; and must not\r\nbelong to any of the classes or professions whose members are      (p. 379)\r\ndebarred by law. All salaried government officials, all persons\r\nreceiving stipends from the state, and all persons ordained for the\r\npriesthood or filling clerical office are disqualified outright.\r\nFurthermore, while officers in the army and navy, ministers,\r\nunder-secretaries, and various other higher functionaries may be\r\nelected, their number must never exceed forty, not including the\r\nministers and under-secretaries. Neither senators nor deputies receive\r\na salary or other compensation, a fact that undoubtedly accounts in\r\nsome measure for the uniformly slender attendance in the chambers.\r\nMembers are permitted, however, to travel free throughout Italy by\r\nrail, or on steamers belonging to lines that have a government\r\ncontract containing a stipulation upon the subject. Measures providing\r\nfor the payment of members have been proposed from time to time, but\r\nnone have received the approval of the two chambers. A measure of the\r\nsort introduced in 1882 by Francesco Crispi, when a deputy, was\r\nrejected by the lower house. More recently, in the electoral bill\r\nvoted by the Chamber of Deputies in 1912 provision is made for the\r\npayment of deputies; but at the time of writing final action upon this\r\nproject has not been taken. Deputies are elected nominally for a\r\nfive-year period, which is the maximum duration of a parliament. In\r\npoint of fact, a dissolution is practically certain to intervene\r\nbefore the expiration of the full term, and the average interval\r\nbetween elections is nearer three years than five. If for any reason a\r\ndeputy ceases to perform his duties, the electoral district that chose\r\nhim is called upon forthwith to elect a new representative.\r\n\r\n*418. The Chambers: Organization.*--The constitution does not prescribe\r\ndefinitely that the parliament shall be assembled annually. It\r\nstipulates merely that the sessions of the two houses shall begin and\r\nend at the same time, that a meeting of one house at a time when the\r\nother is not in session is illegal, and that measures enacted under\r\nsuch circumstances are void.[556] Custom and the necessities of\r\nadministration, however, render it incumbent upon the crown to convoke\r\nthe chambers in at least one session each year, unless, indeed, as has\r\nsometimes happened, a session is so prolonged as to extend, with\r\noccasional recesses, over an entire year, or even two years.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 556: Art. 48. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 12.]\r\n\r\nThe president and vice-president of the Senate are designated by the\r\ncrown, but the president, vice-presidents, and secretaries of the\r\nlower chamber are chosen by the chamber itself from among its own\r\nmembers at the beginning of each session, for the entire session. The\r\npresident of the Deputies, although empowered to appoint certain\r\ncommittees, such as those on rules and contested elections, is not (p. 380)\r\ninfrequently re-elected again and again without regard to party\r\naffiliations, after the manner of the Speaker of the British House of\r\nCommons. The membership of the Chamber of Deputies is divided into\r\nnine _uffici_, or sections, and that of the Senate into five. A fresh\r\ndivision, by lot, takes place every two months. The principal function\r\nof the _uffici_ is the election of those committees for whose\r\nconstitution no other provision is made. In each chamber the most\r\nimportant of all committees, that on the budget, is elected directly\r\nby the chamber. In the Deputies certain other committees are elected\r\nin the same way, while, as has been said, those on elections and on\r\nrules are appointed by the president. But committees specially\r\nconstituted for the consideration of particular measures are made up\r\nof members chosen from the various _uffici_, unless the chamber\r\nprefers to designate some other method.\r\n\r\n*419. The Chambers: Procedure.*--Each house frames its own rules of\r\nprocedure. By the constitution it is stipulated that the sessions\r\nshall be public (with the provision that upon the written request of\r\nten members secret sessions may be held); that Italian shall be the\r\nofficial language; that no session or vote of either house shall be\r\nvalid unless an absolute majority of the members is present; and that\r\nneither house shall receive any deputation, or give hearings to\r\npersons other than the legislative members, ministers, and\r\ncommissioners of the Government.[557] Except such as relate to\r\nfinance, bills on any subject may originate in either house, and at\r\nthe initiative of the Government or of private members, though in\r\npractice all proposals of importance emanate from the Quirinal. The\r\nministers appear regularly on the floor of the two chambers, to\r\nadvocate the measures of the Government and to reply to inquiries. The\r\nright of interpellation is not infrequently exercised, though the\r\ndebate and vote following a challenge of the ministry fall regularly\r\nafter an interval of some days, instead of at once, as in the French\r\nsystem, thus guarding somewhat against precipitancy of action. A\r\nmeasure which is passed in one house is transmitted to the other for\r\nconsideration. After enactment in both houses, it is presented to the\r\nking for approval, which, in practice, is never withheld. A bill\r\nrejected by the crown, or by either house, may not be reintroduced\r\nduring the same session. Votes are taken by rising and sitting, by\r\ndivision, or by secret ballot. The third of these methods is\r\nobligatory in all final votes on enactments, and on measures of a\r\npersonal character. It is specifically enjoined that deputies      (p. 381)\r\nshall represent the nation as a whole, and not the districts from\r\nwhich they are chosen, and to this end no binding instructions may be\r\nimposed upon them by the electors.[558] Except when taken in the\r\nactual commission of an offense, deputies are exempt from arrest\r\nduring the continuance of a session, and they may not be proceeded\r\nagainst in criminal matters without the previous consent of the\r\nChamber. Neither senators nor representatives may be called to account\r\nfor opinions expressed, or for votes cast, in the performance of their\r\nofficial functions.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 557: Arts. 52-54, 59, 62. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 12-13. In practice the\r\n                   requirement of the presence of an absolute majority\r\n                   of members is sometimes disregarded.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 558: Art. 41. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\n*420. General Aspects.*--The provisions of the _Statuto_ respecting the\r\nadministration of justice are brief and general. Justice, it is\r\ndeclared, emanates from the king and is administered in his name by\r\nthe judges whom he appoints. These judges, after three years of\r\nservice, are irremovable. Proceedings of courts in civil cases and\r\nhearings in criminal cases are required to be public. No one may be\r\nwithdrawn from his ordinary legal jurisdiction; and no modification\r\nmay be introduced in respect to courts, tribunals, or judges, save by\r\nlaw.[559] On the basis of these principles there has been built up a\r\nsystem of tribunals which differs in but few important respects from\r\nthe systems in operation in the other Latin countries of Europe. It\r\nconsists, in part, of courts which have been carried over from the\r\nperiod preceding Italian unification and, in part, of courts which owe\r\ntheir existence to legislation subsequent to 1861. The model upon\r\nwhich the system has been developed is the judicial hierarchy of\r\nFrance, and it differs from this system in little save the existence,\r\nas will appear, of five largely independent courts of cassation\r\ninstead of one.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 559: Arts. 68-73. Ibid., II., 14-15.]\r\n\r\n*421. The Ordinary Courts.*--For purposes of justice the kingdom is\r\ndivided into 1,535 _mandamenti_,[560] 162 tribunal districts, and 20\r\nappellate court districts. Within each _mandamento_ is a _pretura_, or\r\nmagistracy, which exercises jurisdiction in civil cases and in cases\r\nof misdemeanors (_contravvenzioni_) and offenses (_delitte_)\r\npunishable by imprisonment not exceeding three months, or banishment\r\nnot exceeding one year, or a fine not exceeding 1,000 lire. In     (p. 382)\r\nminor civil cases, involving sums not in excess of 100 lire,\r\njurisdiction is vested in justices of the peace (_giudici conciliatori_)\r\nwho likewise, upon request, act as arbitrators in cases involving any\r\namount. In each of thirteen of the largest towns there is a _pretura_\r\nwhich exercises penal jurisdiction exclusively. Next above the\r\n_pretori_ stand the penal courts, one in each of the 162 tribunal\r\ndistricts. These exercise jurisdiction in the first instance in\r\noffenses involving a maximum imprisonment of ten years or a fine of\r\nmore than 1,000 lire. To them appeal may be carried from the decisions\r\nof the _pretori_. Closely associated are the courts of assize, which\r\npossess original jurisdiction in cases involving a penalty of\r\nimprisonment for life, or for a period longer than a minimum of five,\r\nand a maximum of ten, years. Save when the Senate is constituted a\r\nhigh court of justice, these tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction of\r\nall press offenses and of all cases involving attacks upon the\r\nsecurity of the state. As a rule, the courts of assize make use of the\r\njury. From their decisions there is no appeal, save upon a point of\r\nform, and appeal lies solely to the court of cassation at Rome. From\r\nthe penal tribunals appeal lies, in cases not dealt with by the assize\r\ncourts, to the twenty courts of appeal.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 560: Prior to 1901 the administrative and\r\n                   electoral _mandamenti_ and the _mandamenti\r\n                   giudiziarii_ were identical geographically, and\r\n                   there were 1,805 of them in the kingdom. By a law\r\n                   of the year mentioned the judicial _mandamenti_\r\n                   were reduced in number to 1,535.]\r\n\r\nAt the top of the system stand five largely independent courts of\r\ncassation, located at the old capitals of Turin, Florence, Naples,\r\nPalermo, and Rome. Each of these exercises, within its own territory,\r\nfinal jurisdiction in all cases involving the ordinary civil law. The\r\ncourt of cassation at Rome, it is true, has been given exclusive\r\njurisdiction in conflicts of competence between different courts,\r\nconflicts between the courts and the administrative authorities, the\r\ntransfer of suits from one tribunal to another, writs of error in\r\ncriminal cases, and a variety of other special matters. But, aside\r\nfrom this, the five tribunals are absolutely equal in function; there\r\nis no appeal from one to another, and the decisions arrived at by one\r\ndo not constitute precedents which the others are obligated to\r\nrecognize. One of the most striking aspects, indeed, of the Italian\r\njudicial system is its lack of centralization; though it should be\r\nadded that the centralizing principle which, since 1870, has dominated\r\nso notably all other departments of the government has been gradually\r\nwinning its way in the judiciary.\r\n\r\n*422. The Administrative Courts.*--In Italy, as in continental countries\r\ngenerally, there is preserved a sharp distinction between public and\r\nprivate law; but the separation of functions of the ordinary and the\r\nadministrative courts is much less clear-cut than in France and\r\nelsewhere. In 1865, indeed, the surviving administrative courts of (p. 383)\r\nthe states which had been drawn into the kingdom, were abolished and\r\nit was arranged that the ordinary courts should exercise unrestricted\r\njurisdiction in all criminal cases and in all civil cases in which, by\r\nthe decision of the Council of State, a civil or political right was\r\ninvolved. The system worked poorly and by laws of June 2, 1889, and\r\nMay 1, 1890, a special section of the Council of State (composed of a\r\npresident and eight councillors named by the king) was set off to\r\nserve as an administrative court, while at the same time an inferior\r\nadministrative jurisdiction was conferred upon the _giunta_ (prefect\r\nand certain assistants) of the province. In practice to-day, when the\r\nlegality of acts committed by the administrative officials is called\r\nin question, the ordinary courts exercise jurisdiction, if the\r\nquestion is one of private _right_; if it is one merely of private\r\n_interest_, it goes for decision to an administrative tribunal. In\r\nmost continental countries _all_ cases involving the legality of\r\nofficial acts fall within the domain of the administrative\r\ncourts.[561]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 561: There is a brief description of the\r\n                   Italian judicial system in Lowell, Governments and\r\n                   Parties, II., 170-178.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*423. Historical Basis.*--In her ancient territorial divisions Italy had\r\nonce the basis of a natural and wholesomely decentralized system of\r\nlocal government. Instead of availing themselves of it, however, the\r\nfounders of the present kingdom preferred to reduce the realm to a\r\n_tabula rasa_ and to erect within it a wholly new and symmetrical\r\nhierarchy of territorial divisions and governmental organs. By a great\r\nstatute of March 20, 1865, there was introduced in the kingdom a\r\nsystem of provincial and communal organization, the essentials of\r\nwhich were taken over in part from Belgium, but more largely from\r\nFrance. The functions and relations of the various local agencies were\r\namplified and given substantially their present form in the law of\r\nDecember 30, 1888, supplemented and amended by acts of July 7, 1889,\r\nand July 11, 1894. So closely has the French model been adhered to\r\nthroughout that the resemblance between the two systems amounts almost\r\nto duplication. The system of Italy calls, therefore, for no very\r\nextended independent description.\r\n\r\nThe units of local government are four in number--the province, the\r\n_circondaro_, the _mandamento_, and the commune. Of these, the first\r\nand last alone possess vitality, distinct interests, and some measure\r\nof autonomy; and throughout the entire series runs that same principle\r\nof thoroughgoing centralization which is the pre-eminent characteristic\r\nof the local governmental system of France. The _circondaro_,      (p. 384)\r\ncorresponding to the French _arrondissement_, is essentially an\r\nelectoral division. Strictly, there are in the kingdom 197 _circondarii_;\r\nbut 87 districts comprising the province of Mantua and the eight\r\nprovinces of Venetia are, in all save name, _circondarii_ also. The\r\n1806 _mandamenti_, or cantons, are but subdivisions of the provinces\r\nfor administrative purposes.\r\n\r\n*424. The Province: Prefect and Council.*--There are in the kingdom 69\r\nprovinces, varying considerably in size but with an average population\r\nof 450,000 to 500,000. The Italian province corresponds closely to the\r\nFrench department. At its head is a prefect, appointed by the crown\r\nand directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior. Like the\r\nFrench prefect, the Italian is a political official, and the fact not\r\nmerely influences his appointment but affects greatly his conduct in\r\noffice. As representative and agent of the central government the\r\nprefect publishes and executes the laws, supervises the provincial\r\nadministration, opens and closes sessions of the provincial council\r\nand sanctions or vetoes the measures of that body, and safeguards in\r\ngeneral the interests of the Government in the province.\r\n\r\nWithin each province is a council of from 20 to 60 members, elected\r\nfor a period of six years on a franchise somewhat broader than that\r\nwhich prevails in parliamentary elections. One-half of the membership\r\nis renewed triennially. The council meets regularly once each year,\r\nnominally for a month's session; but an extraordinary session may be\r\nconvened at any time by the prefect, by the deputation, or upon call\r\nof one-third of the councillors. Aside from the voting of the\r\nprovincial budget, the powers of the council are relatively meager. In\r\npart, e.g., in respect to the maintenance of highways, the control of\r\nsecondary and technical education, and a share in the supervision of\r\ncharity, they are obligatory; in part they are merely permissive. A\r\ndeputation, or commission, of from six to ten persons, elected by the\r\ncouncil from its own membership, represents the council in the\r\nintervals between its sittings and carries on the work which it may\r\nhave in hand. The prefect is advised by a prefectorial council of\r\nthree members appointed by the Government, and he is further assisted\r\nby a _giunta_ of six members, four of whom are elected by the\r\nprovincial council, the other two being drawn from the prefectorial\r\ncouncil. It is the business of the _giunta_ to assist the prefect and\r\nsub-prefects in the supervision of local administration and to serve\r\nas a tribunal for the trial of cases arising under the administrative\r\nlaw. The prefect and the _giunta_ possess large, and to a considerable\r\ndegree, discretionary powers of control over the proceedings of the\r\ncouncil; and the prefect, representing as he does the central government\r\nexclusively, can be called to account only by his superiors at     (p. 385)\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n*425. The Commune: Syndic and Council.*--As in France, the commune is\r\nthe least artificial and the most vigorous of the local governmental\r\nunits. In June, 1911, there were in Italy a total of 8,323 communes,\r\nbesides four boroughs in Sardinia not included in the communal\r\norganization. Each commune has a council of from 15 to 80 members,\r\naccording to its population, elected for a period of six years,\r\none-half retiring every three years. The communal franchise is\r\nappreciably broader than the parliamentary. It extends to all Italian\r\ncitizens twenty-one years of age who can read and write, provided they\r\nare on the parliamentary list, or pay any direct annual contribution\r\nto the commune, or comply with various other very easy conditions. The\r\ncouncil holds two regular sessions a year, though in the large towns\r\nit, in point of fact, meets much more frequently. Between sittings its\r\nwork is carried on by a _giunta_, which serves as a committee to\r\nexecute the resolutions of the council and to draft its budget and\r\nby-laws. The powers of the council are comprehensive. It is obligated\r\nto maintain streets, roads, and markets; to provide for elementary\r\neducation; to make suitable arrangements for the relief of the poor,\r\nthe registration of births and deaths, and of electors; to establish\r\npolice regulations and prisons; and, under varying conditions, to\r\nattend to a wide variety of other matters. The range of its optional\r\nactivities is almost boundless. The council may establish theatres,\r\nfound museums, subsidize public amusements, and, indeed, go to almost\r\nany length in the regulation of local affairs and the expenditure of\r\nlocal funds.[562]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 562: For an arraignment of the\r\n                   extravagance of the local governing authorities see\r\n                   King and Okey, Italy To-day, 267.]\r\n\r\nAs its chief official, every commune has a _sindaco_, i.e., a syndic,\r\nor mayor. Prior to 1896 the syndic was chosen by the communal council\r\nfrom its own members, if the commune had more than 10,000 inhabitants,\r\nor was the capital of a province or _circondaro_; otherwise he was\r\nappointed from among the members of the council by the king. In the\r\ngreat majority of communes the procedure was of the second type. Since\r\n1896 the syndic has been chosen regularly in all communes by the\r\ncouncil, for a term of three years, together with a secretary, elected\r\nin the first instance for two, but afterwards for periods of not less\r\nthan six, years. Despite the fact that the syndic is now elected\r\nuniversally by the communal council, his position is not that\r\nexclusively of executive head of the local community. Like the\r\nprefect, he is a government official, who, save under very exceptional\r\ncircumstances, may be removed only with the prefect's permission. He\r\nmay not be called to account except by his superiors, or sued save (p. 386)\r\nwith the permission of the crown.[563]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 563: For a brief account of local\r\n                   government in Italy see King and Okey, Italy\r\n                   To-day, Chap. 14.

QUIRINAL AND VATICAN\r\n\r\nItaly differs from other nations of importance in containing what is\r\nessentially a state within a state. The capital of the kingdom is\r\nlikewise the capital of the Catholic world--the administrative seat of\r\na government which is not only absolutely independent of the\r\ngovernment of the Italian nation but is in no small degree\r\nantagonistic to it. It need hardly be remarked that the consequences\r\nof this anomalous situation affect profoundly the practical operations\r\nof government, and especially the crystallization and programmes of\r\npolitical parties, in the peninsula.\r\n\r\n*426. Termination of the Temporal Power.*--One goal toward which the\r\nfounders of the kingdom directed their efforts was the realization of\r\nthe ideal of Cavour, \"a free church in a free state.\" A thoroughgoing\r\napplication of this principle proved impracticable, but such progress\r\nhas been made toward it as to constitute, for Italy, a veritable\r\nrevolution. On the 20th of September, 1870, the armed forces of King\r\nVictor Emmanuel crossed the bounds of the petty papal dominion about\r\nRome, entered the city, and by a few sharp strokes beat down all\r\nforcible opposition to the sovereignty of the united Italian nation.\r\nPope Pius IX. refused absolutely to acquiesce in the loss of his\r\ntemporal dominion, but he was powerless to prevent it. His sole hope\r\nof indemnity lay in a possible intervention of the Catholic powers in\r\nhis behalf--a hope which by Prussia's defeat of France and the\r\ndownfall of the Emperor Napoleon III. was rendered extremely\r\nunsubstantial. The possibility of intervention was, however,\r\nsufficiently considerable to occasion real apprehension on the part of\r\nVictor Emmanuel and of those attached to the interests of the young\r\nnation. In part to avert complications abroad, as well as with an\r\nhonest purpose to adjust a difficult situation, the Government made\r\nhaste to devise what it considered a fair, safe, and honorable\r\nsettlement of its relations with the papal authority. The result was\r\nthe fundamental statute known as the Law of the Papal Guarantees,\r\nenacted March 21, 1871, after a heated parliamentary contest       (p. 388)\r\nlasting upwards of two months, and promulgated under date of May 13\r\nfollowing.[564]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 564: Text in Coglio e Malchiodi, Codice\r\n                   Politico Amministrativo. An English version is\r\n                   printed in Dodd, Modern Constitutions, II., 16-21.]\r\n\r\n*427. The Law of Papal Guarantees, 1871: Papal Prerogatives.*--This\r\nimportant measure, which remains to this day unchanged, falls into two\r\nprincipal parts. The first is concerned with the prerogatives of the\r\nSupreme Pontiff and of the Holy See; the second regulates the legal\r\nrelations of church and state within the kingdom. In a series of\r\nthirteen articles there is enumerated a sum total of papal privileges\r\nwhich constitutes the Vatican an essentially sovereign and independent\r\npower. First of all, the Pope is declared sacred and inviolable, and\r\nany offense against his person is made punishable with the same\r\npenalty as a similar offense against the person of the king. In the\r\nsecond place, the Italian Government \"grants to the Supreme Pontiff,\r\nwithin the kingdom, sovereign honors, and guarantees to him the\r\npre-eminence customarily accorded to him by Catholic sovereigns.\"[565]\r\nDiplomatic agents accredited to him, and envoys whom he may send to\r\nforeign states, are entitled to all the prerogatives and immunities\r\nwhich international law accords to diplomatic agents generally. In\r\nlieu of the revenues which were cut off by the loss of the temporal\r\ndominion there is settled upon the Pope a permanent income to be paid\r\nfrom the treasury of the state. For the uses of the Holy See--the\r\npreservation and custody of the apostolic palaces, compensation and\r\npensions for guards and attachés, the keeping of the Vatican museums\r\nand library, and any other needful purposes--there is reserved the sum\r\nof 3,225,000 lire ($645,000) annually, to be \"entered in the great\r\nbook of the public debt as a perpetual and inalienable income of the\r\nHoly See.\"[566] The obligation thus assumed by the state may never be\r\nrepudiated, nor may the amount stipulated be reduced. Permanent\r\npossession, furthermore, of the Vatican and Lateran palaces, with all\r\nbuildings, museums, libraries, gardens, and lands appertaining thereto\r\n(including the church of St. Peter's), together with the villa at\r\nCastel Gandolfo, is expressly guaranteed, and it is stipulated, not\r\nonly that these properties shall be exempt from all taxation and\r\ncharges and from seizure for public purposes, but that, except with\r\npapal permission, no public official or agent in the performance of\r\nhis public duties shall so much as enter the papal palaces or grounds,\r\nor any place where there may be in session at any time a conclave or\r\necumenical council. During a vacancy of the pontifical chair no\r\njudicial or political functionary may, on any pretext, invade the  (p. 389)\r\npersonal liberty of the cardinals, and the Government engages\r\nspecifically to see to it that conclaves and ecumenical councils shall\r\nnot be molested by external disorder.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 565: Art. 3. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 16.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 566: Art. 4. Ibid., 17.]\r\n\r\n*428. Papal Freedom in the Exercise of Spiritual Functions.*--In the\r\nexercises of spiritual functions the independence of the Holy See is\r\nfully secured. The Pope may correspond freely with the bishops and\r\nwith \"the whole Catholic world,\" without interference from the\r\nGovernment.[567] Papers, documents, books, and registers deposited in\r\npontifical offices or in congregations of an exclusively spiritual\r\ncharacter are exempt from all legal processes of visit, search, or\r\nsequestration, and ecclesiastics may not be called to account by the\r\ncivil authorities for taking part officially in the promulgation of\r\nany act pertaining to the spiritual ministry of the Holy See. To\r\nfacilitate the administration of papal affairs the right is granted of\r\nmaintaining separate postal and telegraph offices, of transmitting\r\nsealed packages of correspondence under the papal stamp, either\r\ndirectly or through the Italian post, and of sending couriers who,\r\nwithin the kingdom, are placed on an equal footing with emissaries of\r\nforeign governments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 567: Art. 12. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 19.]\r\n\r\n*429. Legal Relations of Church and State.*--The regulations by which\r\nthe relations of church and state are governed more specifically begin\r\nwith the abolition of all restrictions upon the right of members of\r\nthe Catholic clergy to assemble for ecclesiastical purposes. With\r\nprovisional exceptions, the _exequatur_, the _placet_, and all other\r\nforms of civil authorization of spiritual measures are done away.[568]\r\nThe state yields its ancient right of nominating to bishoprics, and\r\nthe bishops themselves are no longer required to take oath of fidelity\r\nto the king. In matters of spiritual discipline it is stipulated that\r\nthere shall be no appeal to the civil courts from the decisions of the\r\necclesiastical authorities. If, however, any ecclesiastical decision\r\nor act contravenes a law of the state, subverts public order, or\r\nencroaches upon the rights of individuals, it is, _ipso facto_, of no\r\neffect; and in respect to these things the state is constituted sole\r\njudge. The Church, in short, is granted a very large measure of\r\nfreedom and of autonomy; but at the same time it is not so far\r\nprivileged as to be removed beyond the pale of the public law. If its\r\nmeasures constitute offenses, they are subject to the provisions of\r\nthe ordinary criminal code.[569]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 568: On the Government's use of the\r\n                   _exequatur_ since 1871 see King and Okey, Italy\r\n                   To-day, 253.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 569: By act of July 12, 1871, articles\r\n                   268-270 of the Italian penal code were so modified\r\n                   as to render ecclesiastics liable to imprisonment\r\n                   of from six months to five years, and to fines of\r\n                   from one thousand to three thousand lire, for\r\n                   spoken or written attacks upon the state, or for\r\n                   the incitement of disorder.]\r\n\r\n*430. Papal Opposition to the Existing System.*--The arrangements  (p. 390)\r\nthus comprised in the Law of Guarantees have never received the\r\nsanction of the papacy. They rest exclusively upon the authority of\r\nthe state. Pope Pius IX., flatly refusing to accept them, issued, May\r\n15, 1871, an encyclical to the bishops of the Church repudiating the\r\nLaw and calling upon Catholic princes everywhere to co-operate in the\r\nrestoration of the temporal power. The call was unheeded, and the Pope\r\nfell back upon the obstructionist policy of maintaining absolutely no\r\nrelations, with the Italian kingdom. His successor, Leo XIII.,\r\npreserved essentially the same attitude, and, although many times it\r\nhas been intimated that the present Pope, Pius X., is more disposed to\r\na conciliatory policy, it still is true that the only recognition\r\nwhich is accorded the Quirinal by the Vatican is of a purely passive\r\nand involuntary character. The Pope persists in regarding himself as\r\n\"the prisoner of the Vatican.\" He will not so much as set foot outside\r\nthe petty domain which has been assigned to him, because his doing so\r\nmight be construed as a virtual recognition of the legality of the\r\nauthority of the kingdom within the Eternal City. Not a penny of the\r\nannuity whose payment to the Holy See was stipulated in 1871 has been\r\ntouched. By the Italian Government the annuity itself has been made\r\nsubject to quinquennial prescription, so that in the event of a\r\nrecognition of the Law at any time by the papacy not more than a\r\nfive-year quota, with interest, could be collected.\r\n\r\nAs to the measure of fidelity with which the Government has fulfilled\r\nthe obligations which it assumed under the Law, there is, naturally, a\r\nwide divergence of opinion. The authors of what is probably the most\r\nauthoritative book on Italy written from a detached and impartial\r\npoint of view say that \"on the whole, one is bound to conclude that\r\nthe Government has stretched the Law of Guarantees in its own\r\ninterest, but that the brevity and incompleteness of the Law is\r\nchiefly responsible for the difficulty in construing it.\"[570]\r\nUndoubtedly it may be affirmed that the spirit of the Law has been\r\nobserved with consistency, though the exigencies of temporal interest\r\nhave compelled not infrequently the non-observance of the letter. So\r\nlong as the Vatican persists in holding rigidly aloof from\r\nco-operation in the arrangement the Law obviously cannot be executed\r\nwith the spontaneity and completeness that were intended by its\r\nframers. The situation is unfortunate, alike for state and church, and\r\nsubversive of the best interests of the Italian people.[571]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 570: King and Okey, Italy To-day, 255.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 571: For a brief discussion of the\r\n                   subject of church and state in Italy see King and\r\n                   Okey, Italy To-day, Chaps. 2 and 13.

Party Beginnings: the Conservative Ascendancy, 1861-1876.*--In\r\nItaly, as in France, political parties are numerous and their\r\nconstituencies and programmes are subject to rapid and bewildering\r\nfluctuation. In the earliest days of the kingdom party lines were not\r\nsharply drawn. In the parliament elected in January, 1861, the\r\nsupporters of Cavour numbered 407, while the strength of the\r\nopposition was but 36. After the death of Cavour, however, June 6,\r\n1861, the cleavage which already had begun to mark off the Radicals,\r\nor Left, from the Conservatives, or Right, was accentuated, and the\r\nLeft grew rapidly in numbers and in influence. During the period\r\nbetween 1861 and 1870 the two parties differed principally upon the\r\nquestion of the completion of Italian unity, the Conservatives\r\nfavoring a policy of caution and delay, the Radicals urging that the\r\nissue be forced at the earliest opportunity. With the exception of\r\nbrief intervals in 1862 and 1867, when the Radicals, under Rattazzi,\r\ngained the upper hand, the government during the period indicated was\r\nadministered by the Conservative ministries of Ricasoli (the successor\r\nof Cavour), Minghetti, La Marmora, Menabrea, and Lanza. Each of the\r\nRattazzi ministries had as one of its principal incidents an invasion\r\nof the papal territory by Garibaldi, and each fell primarily because\r\nof the fear of the nation that its continuance in power would mean war\r\nwith France. The unification of the peninsula was left to be\r\naccomplished by the Conservatives.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870 the dominance of the Conservatives was prolonged to 1876.\r\nThe Lanza government, whose most distinguished member was the finance\r\nminister Sella, lasted until July 10, 1873, and the second ministry of\r\nMinghetti, given distinction by the able foreign minister\r\nVisconti-Venosta, filled out the period to March 18, 1876. Upon these\r\ntwo ministries devolved the enormous task of organizing more fully the\r\ngovernmental system of the kingdom, and especially of bringing order\r\nout of chaos in the national finances. The work was effectively\r\nperformed, but when it had been completed the nation was more than\r\nready to drive the Conservatives from office. The Conservative\r\nadministration had been honest and efficient, but it had been rigid\r\nand at times harsh. It had set itself squarely against the democracy\r\nof Garibaldi, Crispi, and Depretis; it had sought to retain the    (p. 392)\r\nimportant offices of state in the hands of its own immediate\r\nadherents; and in the execution of its fiscal measures it had been\r\nexacting, and even ruthless. March 18, 1876, the Minghetti government\r\nfound itself lacking a majority in the Chamber, whereupon it retired\r\nand was replaced by a Radical ministry under the premiership of\r\nDepretis, successor of Rattazzi in the leadership of the Left. A\r\nnational election which followed, in November, yielded the new\r\nGovernment the overwhelming parliamentary majority of 421 to 87.\r\n\r\n*432. The Rule of the Radicals, 1876-1896.*--Prior to their accession to\r\npower the Radical leaders had criticised so sharply the fiscal and\r\nadministrative policies of their opponents that they were expected by\r\nmany persons to overturn completely the existing order of the state.\r\nAs all but invariably happens under such circumstances, however, when\r\nthe \"outs\" became the \"ins\" their point of view, and consequently\r\ntheir purposes, underwent a remarkable transformation. In almost every\r\nessential the policies, and even the methods, of the Conservatives\r\nwere perpetuated, and the importance of the political overturn of 1876\r\narises, not from any shift which took place from one style of\r\ngovernment to another, but from its effects upon the composition and\r\nalignment of the parties themselves. During its fifteen-year\r\nascendancy the Right had exhibited again and again a glaring lack of\r\ncoherence; yet its unity was in reality considerably more substantial\r\nthan was that of the Left. So long as the Radicals occupied the\r\nposition of opponents of the Government they were able, indeed, to\r\npresent a seemingly solid front. But when it fell to them to organize\r\nministries, to frame and enact measures, and to conduct the\r\nadministration, the fact appeared instantly that they had neither a\r\nconstructive programme nor a unified leadership. The upshot was that\r\nupon its advent to power the Left promptly fell apart into the several\r\ngroups of which it was composed, and never thereafter was there\r\nsubstantial co-operation among these groups, save at rare intervals\r\nwhen co-operation was necessary to prevent the return to office of the\r\nConservatives.\r\n\r\n*433. The Depretis Ministries, 1876-1887.*--That portion of the party\r\nwhich first acquired ascendancy was the more moderate, under the\r\nleadership of Depretis. Its programme may be said to have embraced the\r\nextension of the franchise, the enforcement of the rights of the state\r\nin relation to the Church, the incompatibility of a parliamentary\r\nmandate with the holding of public office, the maintenance of the\r\nmilitary and naval policy instituted by the Conservatives, and,\r\neventually, fiscal reform, though the amelioration of taxation was\r\ngiven no such prominence as the nation had been led to expect.     (p. 393)\r\nSave for the brief intervals occupied by the two Cairoli ministries of\r\n1878 and 1879-1881, Depretis continued in the office of premier from\r\n1876 until his death, in the summer of 1887. Again and again during\r\nthis period the personnel of the ministry was changed. Ministers who\r\nmade themselves unpopular were replaced by new ones,[572] and so\r\ncomplete became the lack of dividing principles between the parties\r\nthat in 1883 there was established a Depretis cabinet which\r\nrepresented a coalition of the moderate Left and the Right.[573] The\r\ncoalition, however, proved ill-advised, and when, July 27, 1887,\r\nDepretis died he left behind him a government which represented rather\r\na fusion of the moderate and radical wings of the Left. By reason of\r\nthe disintegrated condition of parties Depretis had been able to\r\noverride habitually the fundamental principles of parliamentarism and\r\nto maintain through many years a government which lived from hand to\r\nmouth on petty manoeuvers. The franchise, it is true, had been\r\nbroadened by the law of 1882, and some of the more odious taxes, e.g.,\r\nthe much complained of grist tax, had been abolished. But electoral\r\ncorruption had been condoned, if not encouraged; the civil service had\r\nbeen degraded to a mere machine of the ministerial majority; and the\r\nnation had been led to embark upon highly questionable policies of\r\ncolonial expansion, alliance with Germany and Austria, and protective\r\ntariffs.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 572: This partial renewal of a ministry,\r\n                   known in Italy as a _rimpasto_, was, and still is,\r\n                   rendered easy by the average ministry's lack of\r\n                   political solidarity.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 573: This coalition policy--the so-called\r\n                   _transformismo_--did not originate with Depretis.\r\n                   As early as 1873 a portion of the Right under\r\n                   Minghetti, by joining the Left, had overturned the\r\n                   Lanza-Sella cabinet; and in 1876 Minghetti himself\r\n                   had fallen a victim to a similar defection of\r\n                   Conservative deputies.]\r\n\r\n*434. The First Crispi, First Rudini, and First Giolitti Ministries,\r\n1887-1893.*--The successor of Depretis was Crispi, in reality the only\r\nman of first-rate statesmanship in the ranks of the Left. To him it\r\nfell to tide the nation safely over the crises attendant upon the\r\ndeath (January 9, 1878) of King Victor Emmanuel II. and that (February\r\n7 following) of Pope Pius IX. The personality of Crispi was very much\r\nmore forceful than was that of Depretis and the grasp which he secured\r\nupon the political situation rendered his position little short of\r\nthat of a dictator. The elections of 1876 had reduced to impotence the\r\nold Right as a party of opposition, and although prior to Crispi's\r\nministry there had been some recovery, the Left continued in all but\r\nuncontested power. In the elections of November, 1890, the Government\r\nwas accorded an overwhelming majority. None the less, largely by\r\nreason of his uncontrollable temper, Crispi allowed himself, at the\r\nend of January, 1891, to be forced by the Conservatives into a     (p. 394)\r\nposition such that the only course open to him was to resign.\r\n\r\nThere followed a transitional period during which the chaos of party\r\ngroups was made more than ever apparent. The Rudini ministry, composed\r\nof representatives of both the Right and the Left, survived little\r\nmore than a year. May 5, 1892, the formation of a ministry was\r\nintrusted by King Humbert to Giolitti, a Piedmontese deputy and at one\r\ntime minister of finance in the Crispi cabinet. The product was a\r\nministry supported by the groups of the Centre and the Left, but\r\nopposed by those of the Right and of the Extreme Left. Parliament was\r\ndissolved and during the ensuing November were held national elections\r\nin which, by exercise of the grossest sort of official pressure, the\r\nGovernment was able to win a substantial victory. The period covered\r\nby Giolitti's ministry--marked by a cringing foreign policy, an almost\r\nutter breakdown of the national finances, and the scandals of 1893 in\r\nconnection with the management of state banks, especially the Banca\r\nRomana--may well be regarded as the most unfortunate in Italian\r\nhistory since the completion of national unity. The revelations made,\r\nNovember 23, 1893, by a committee appointed by Parliament to\r\ninvestigate the bank scandals were of such a character that the\r\nGiolitti ministry retired from office, November 24, without so much as\r\nchallenging a vote of confidence. After prolonged delay a new ministry\r\nwas made up, December 10, by Crispi, whose return to power was\r\ndictated by the conviction of the nation that no one else was\r\nqualified to deal with a situation so desperate.\r\n\r\n*435. The Second Crispi Ministry, 1893-1896.*--The second Crispi\r\nministry extended from December, 1893, to March, 1896. Politically,\r\nthe period was one of extreme unsettlement. Supported by the Centre\r\nand the Left, substantially as Giolitti had been, the Government\r\nsuppressed disorder, effected economies, and entered upon an ambitious\r\nattempt at colonial aggrandizement in East Africa. But it was opposed\r\nby the Extreme Left, a large portion of the Right, and the adherents\r\nof Giolitti, so that its position was always precarious. In December,\r\n1894, Giolitti produced papers purporting to show that Crispi himself\r\nhad been implicated in the bank irregularities. The effort to bring\r\nabout the premier's fall failed, although there ensued a veritable war\r\nbetween the cabinet and the chambers, in the course of which even the\r\nappearance of parliamentary government was abandoned. In the elections\r\nof May, 1895, the Government was victorious, and it was only by reason\r\nof public indignation arising from the failure of the Eritrean\r\nenterprise that, finally, March 5, 1896, Crispi and his colleagues\r\nsurrendered office.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE ERA OF COMPOSITE MINISTRIES, 1896-1912                    (p. 395)\r\n\r\nDuring the period which was terminated by the retirement of Crispi the\r\nsuccessive ministries, while occasionally including representatives of\r\nmore than a single political group, exhibited normally a considerable\r\ndegree of solidarity. After 1896 there set in, however, an epoch\r\nduring which the growing multiplicity of parties bore fruit in\r\ncabinets of amazingly composite character. In the place of the fairly\r\nsubstantial Conservative and Radical parties of the seventies stood\r\nnow upwards of half a score of contending factions, some durable, some\r\nbut transitory. No government could survive a month save by the\r\nsupport of an affiliation of a number of these groups. But such\r\naffiliations were, in the nature of things, artificial and\r\nprovisional, and ministerial stability became what it remains to-day,\r\na thing universally desired but rarely enjoyed.\r\n\r\n*436. The Second Rudini and the Pelloux Ministries, 1896-1900.*--To\r\nGeneral Ricotti-Magnani was committed, at Crispi's fall in 1896, the\r\ntask of forming a new ministry. After some delay the premiership was\r\nbestowed upon Rudini, now leader of the Right. The new Government,\r\nconstructed to attract the support of both the Right and the Extreme\r\nLeft, took as its principal object the elimination of Crispi from the\r\narena of politics. In time its foreign policy was strengthened\r\nappreciably by the return of Visconti-Venosta, after twenty years, to\r\nthe foreign office, but home affairs were administered in a grossly\r\ninefficient manner. Bound by a secret understanding with Cavalotti,\r\nthe leader of the Extreme Left, Rudini was obliged to submit\r\nhabitually to radical dictation, and the elections of 1899, conducted\r\nspecifically to crush the adherents of Crispi, threw open yet wider\r\nthe door of opportunity for the Socialists, the Republicans, and the\r\nradical elements generally. The Rudini ministry survived until June\r\n18, 1898, when it was overthrown in consequence of riots occasioned in\r\nsouthern Italy by a rise in the price of bread.\r\n\r\nJune 29, 1898, a ministry was made up by General Pelloux which was\r\nessentially colorless politically and whose immediate programme\r\nconsisted solely in the passage of a public safety measure originated\r\nduring the preceding ministry. When, in June, 1900, the Government\r\ndissolved parliament and appealed to the country the result was\r\nanother appreciable increase of power on the part of the radicals. In\r\nthe new chamber the extremists--Radicals, Republicans, and\r\nSocialists--numbered nearly 100, or double their former strength. The\r\nPelloux government forthwith retired, and a Liberal ministry was\r\nconstituted (June 24, 1900) under Saracco, president of the        (p. 396)\r\nSenate. Five weeks later, upon the assassination of King Humbert,\r\noccurred the accession of the present sovereign, Victor Emmanuel III.\r\n\r\n*437. The Saracco and Zanardelli Ministries, 1900-1903.*--The Saracco\r\nministry, formed as a cabinet of pacification, was overthrown February\r\n7, 1901, in consequence of its hesitating attitude towards a dock\r\nstrike at Genoa. It was succeeded by a ministry containing Giolitti\r\n(in the portfolio of the interior) and presided over by Zanardelli,\r\nlong a leader of the extremer wing of the Radicals. The members of the\r\nnew Government were drawn from several groups. Three were of\r\nZanardelli's following, three were adherents of Giolitti, three\r\nbelonged to the Right, one was a Crispian, and two were Independents.\r\nSuch was their forced reliance, however, upon the support of the\r\nExtreme Left that the formation of this cabinet served as an impetus\r\nto a notable advance on the part of the extremer groups, especially\r\nthe Socialists.\r\n\r\n*438. Giolitti, Fortis, and Sonnino, 1903-1909.*--In October, 1903,\r\nPremier Zanardelli retired, by reason of ill-health, and the cabinet\r\nwas reconstituted under Giolitti. Aside from the premier, its most\r\ndistinguished members were Tittoni, minister of foreign affairs, and\r\nLuzzatti, minister of finance. The position of the new Government was\r\ninsecure, and although the elections of November, 1904, resulted in\r\nthe return of a substantial ministerial majority, the cabinet,\r\nrealizing that it really lacked the support of the country, resigned\r\nin March, 1905. A new and colorless ministry, that of Fortis, lasted\r\nless than a year, i.e., until February 2, 1906. The coalition cabinet\r\nof Sonnino proved even less long-lived. The well-known statesmanship\r\nof Sonnino, together with the fact that men of ability, such as\r\nLuzzatti and Guicciardini, were placed in charge of various\r\nportfolios, afforded ground for the hope that there might ensue an\r\nincreased measure of parliamentary stability. But the hope was vain\r\nand, May 17, 1906, the ministry abandoned office. Curiously enough,\r\nthe much desired stability was realized under a new Giolitti\r\ngovernment, composed, as all Italian governments in these days must\r\nbe, of representatives of a number of political groups. In part by\r\nreason of the shrewdness of the premier and his colleagues, in part by\r\nreason of sheer circumstance, the Giolitti cabinet maintained steadily\r\nits position until December 2, 1909, although, as need hardly be\r\nobserved, during these three and a half years there were numerous\r\nchanges in the tenure of individual portfolios.\r\n\r\n*439. Second Sonnino and Luzzatti Ministries, 1909-1911.*--Upon the\r\nretirement of Giolitti there was constituted a second Sonnino\r\nministry, composed of elements drawn from all of the moderate groups\r\nfrom the Liberal Right to the Democratic Left. The programme which it\r\nannounced included electoral reform, the improvement of primary    (p. 397)\r\neducation, measures for the encouragement of agriculture,\r\nreorganization of local taxation, reduction of the period of military\r\nservice to two years, and a multiplicity of other ambitious projects.\r\nScarcely more fortunate, however, was the second Sonnino government\r\nthan had been the first, and, in the midst of the turmoil attending\r\nthe debates upon a Shipping Conventions bill, the premier and his\r\ncolleagues felt themselves forced to retire, March 21, 1910.\r\n\r\nGiolitti refused to attempt the formation of another ministry, and the\r\ntask devolved upon the former minister of finance, Luzzatti. In the\r\nnew cabinet the premier and one other member represented the Liberal\r\nelement of the Right; one member represented the Centre; three were\r\nadherents of Giolitti; two were Radicals; one was a Socialist; and two\r\nprofessed independence of all groups. Whatever of advantage might be\r\nsupposed to accrue from a government which was broadly representative\r\ncould legitimately be expected from this combination; although the\r\ncomposite character of the ministry, it was well enough understood,\r\nmust of necessity operate to the detriment of the Government's unity\r\nand influence. The programme which the Luzzatti ministry announced was\r\nno less ambitious than that put forward by its predecessor. Included\r\nin it were the establishment of proportional representation, the\r\nextension of the suffrage, measures to remedy unemployment and other\r\nindustrial ills, compulsory insurance for agricultural laborers,\r\nresistance to clerical intrigue and the prevention of anti-clerical\r\nprovocations, and the usual pledge to maintain the Triple Alliance.\r\n\r\n*440. Giolitti and the Left, 1911-.*--The life of the Luzzatti\r\ngovernment covered barely a twelvemonth. March 29, 1911, Giolitti\r\nreturned to the premiership, signalizing his restoration to power by\r\navowing in the Chamber a programme of policies which, for the time at\r\nleast, elicited the support of all of the more important party groups.\r\nThe composition of the new government differed but slightly from that\r\nof the former one, but the fact was undisguised that Giolitti relied\r\nfor support principally upon the more radical elements of the nation,\r\nand that, furthermore, he did so with the full assent of the king. A\r\nstriking evidence of this was the invitation which was extended the\r\nsocialist leader Bissolati to assume a post in the ministry. Certain\r\nobstacles arose which prevented acceptance of the offered position,\r\nbut when the Government's programme was being given shape Bissolati\r\nwas called repeatedly into counsel, and it is understood that the\r\nministry's pronouncement in behalf of universal suffrage and the\r\nreduction of military and naval expenditures was inspired immediately\r\nby socialist influence. Socialism in Italy, it may be observed, is not\r\nentirely anti-monarchical, as it is in France and Spain; on the    (p. 398)\r\ncontrary, it tends constantly to subordinate political to social\r\nquestions and ends. Bissolati is himself an exponent of the\r\nevolutionary type of socialism, as is Briand in France. The first vote\r\nof confidence accorded the Giolitti government was participated in by\r\nthe Giolitti Liberals, the Democratic Left, the Radicals, and a\r\nsection of the Socialists--by, in short, a general coalition of the\r\nLeft. The shift of political gravity toward the Left, of which the\r\nvote was symptomatic, is the most fundamental aspect of the political\r\nsituation in Italy to-day, even as it is in that of France. During\r\nmore than a generation the grouping of parties and factions has been\r\nsuch as to preclude the formation of a compact and disciplined\r\nmajority able and willing to grapple with the great social questions\r\nwhich successive ministries have inscribed in their programmes. But it\r\nseems not impossible that a working _entente_ among the groups of the\r\nLeft may in time produce the legislative stability requisite for\r\nsystematic and fruitful legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PHASES OF PARTY POLITICS\r\n\r\n*441. Lack of a Conservative Party: Effects.*--\"From the beginning,\"\r\nsays an Italian writer, \"the constitution of our parties has been\r\ndetermined, not at all by great historical or political\r\nconsiderations, but by considerations of a purely personal nature, and\r\nthis aspect has been accentuated more and more as we have progressed\r\nin constitutional development. The natural conditions surrounding the\r\nbirth and growth of the new nation did not permit the formation of a\r\ntrue conservative party which could stand in opposition to a liberal\r\nparty. The liberal party, therefore, occupying the entire field,\r\ndivided empirically into groups, denominated not less empirically\r\nRight and Left, in accordance with simple distinctions of degrees and\r\nforms, and perchance also of personal disposition.\"[574]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 574: Cardon, Del governo nella monarchia\r\n                   costituzionale, 125.]\r\n\r\nThe preponderating facts, in short, relative to political parties in\r\nItaly are two: (1) the absence of any genuine conservative party such\r\nas in virtually every other European state plays a rôle of greater or\r\nlesser importance, and (2) the splitting of the liberal forces, which\r\nelsewhere are bound to co-operate against the conservatives, into a\r\nnumber of factional groups, dominated largely by factional leaders,\r\nand unwilling to unite save in occasional coalitions for momentary\r\nadvantage. The lack of a genuine conservative party is to be explained\r\nlargely by the anomalous situation which has existed since 1870 in\r\nrespect to church and state. Until late years that important element,\r\nthe clericals, which normally would have constituted, as does its\r\ncounterpart in France, the backbone of a conservative party has    (p. 399)\r\npersisted in the purely passive policy of abstention from national\r\npolitics. In the evolution of party groupings it has had no part, and\r\nin Parliament it has been totally unrepresented. Until recently all\r\nactive party groups were essentially \"liberal,\" and rarely did any one\r\nof them put forward a programme which served to impart to it any vital\r\ndistinction from its rivals. Each was little more than a faction,\r\nunited by personal ties, fluctuating in membership and in leadership,\r\nfighting with such means as for the moment appeared dependable for the\r\nperquisites of office. Of broadly national political issues there were\r\nnone, just as indeed there were no truly national parties.\r\n\r\n*442. The Groups of the Extreme Left.*--More recently there has begun to\r\nbe a certain development in the direction of national parties and of\r\nstable party programmes. This is coming about primarily through the\r\ngrowth of the Extreme Left, and especially of the Socialists. Although\r\nthe effects are as yet scarcely perceptible, so that the politics of\r\nthe country exhibit still all of the changeableness, ineffectiveness,\r\nand chaos characteristic of the group system, the development of the\r\n_partiti populari_ which compose collectively the Extreme Left, i.e.,\r\nthe Republicans, the Radicals, and the Socialists, is an interesting\r\npolitical phenomenon.[575] The Republicans are not numerous or well\r\norganized. Quite impotent between 1870 and 1890, they gained no little\r\nground during the struggle against Crispi; but the rise of socialism\r\nhas weakened them, and the party may now be said to be distinctly in\r\ndecline. To employ the expressive phrase of the Italians, the\r\nRepublicans are but _quattro noci in un sacco_, four nuts rattling in\r\na bag. The Radicals are stronger, and their outlook is much more\r\npromising. They are monarchists who are dissatisfied with the\r\nmisgovernment of the older parties, but who distrust socialism. They\r\ndraw especially from the artisans and lower middle class, and are\r\nstrongest in Lombardy, Venetia, and Tuscany.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 575: For an exposition of party\r\n                   conditions during the past decade see A. Labrioli,\r\n                   Storia di dieci anni, 1899-1909 (Milan, 1910).]\r\n\r\n*443. The Rise of Socialism.*--In not a few respects the master fact of\r\nItalian politics to-day is the remarkable growth of the Socialist\r\nparty. The origins of the socialist movement in Italy may be traced to\r\nthe Congress of Rimini in 1872, but during a considerable period\r\nItalian socialism was scarcely distinguishable from Bakuninian\r\nanarchism, and it was not before 1890 that the line between the two\r\nwas drawn with precision. In 1891 was founded the collectivist journal\r\n_Critica Sociale_, and in the same year was held the first Italian\r\ncongress which was distinctively socialist. In 1892 came the final\r\nbreak with the anarchists, and since this date socialism in Italy  (p. 400)\r\nhas differed in no essential particulars from its counterpart in\r\nother countries. Between 1891 and 1893 the new party was allied with\r\nthe Right, but Crispi's relentless policy of repression in 1894 had\r\nthe effect of driving gradually the radical groups, Republicans,\r\nRadicals, and Socialists, into co-operation, and it is to this period\r\nthat the origins of the present coalition of the groups of the Extreme\r\nLeft are to be traced. During the years 1895-1900 the Socialists\r\nassumed definitely the position of the advanced wing of a great\r\nparliamentary party, with a very definite programme of political and\r\nsocial reform. This \"minimum programme,\" as it was gradually given\r\nshape, came to comprise as its most essential features the\r\nestablishment of universal suffrage for adults of both sexes, the\r\npayment of deputies and members of local councils, the enactment of a\r\nmore humane penal code, the replacing of the standing army by a\r\nnational militia, improved factory legislation, compulsory insurance\r\nagainst sickness, the reform of laws regulating the relations of\r\nlandlords and tenants, the nationalization of railways and mines, the\r\nextension of compulsory education, the abolition of duties on food,\r\nand the enactment of a progressive income tax and succession duty. The\r\nwidespread dissatisfaction of Italians with the older parties, the\r\npractical character of the socialist programme, and the comparatively\r\nable leadership of the socialist forces have combined to give\r\nsocialism an enormous growth within the past fifteen years. In 1895\r\nthe party polled 60,000 votes and returned to the Chamber of Deputies\r\n12 members. In 1897 it polled 108,000 votes and returned 16 members.\r\nThereafter the quota of seats carried at successive elections rose as\r\nfollows: 1900, 33; 1904, 26; 1906, 42; and 1909, 43.\r\n\r\n*444. The Catholics and Politics: the Non Expedit.*--Aside from the\r\ngrowth of socialism, the most important development in recent Italian\r\npolitics has been the changed attitude of the Holy See with respect to\r\nthe participation of Catholics in political affairs. The term\r\n\"Catholic\" in Italy has a variety of significations. From one point of\r\nview it denotes the great mass of the people--97.1 per cent in\r\n1910--who are not Protestants, Greeks, Jews, or adherents of any faith\r\nother than the Roman. In another sense it denotes that very much\r\nsmaller portion of the people who regularly and faithfully observe\r\nCatholic precepts of worship. Finally, it denotes also the still\r\nsmaller body of men who yield the Pope implicit obedience in all\r\nmatters, civil as well as ecclesiastical, and who, with papal\r\nsanction, are beginning to constitute an organized force in politics.\r\nAfter it had become manifest that the Holy See might not hope for\r\nassistance from the Catholic powers in the recovery of its temporal\r\npossessions and of its accustomed independence, there was worked   (p. 401)\r\nout gradually at the Vatican a policy under which pressure was to be\r\nbrought to bear upon the Italian state from within. This policy\r\ncomprised abstention from participation in national political life on\r\nthe part of as many citizens as could be induced to admit the right of\r\nthe papal government to control their civic conduct. In protest\r\nagainst the alleged usurpations of secular power Pope Pius IX.\r\npromulgated, in 1883, the memorable decree _Non Expedit_, by which it\r\nwas declared \"inexpedient\" that Catholics should vote at parliamentary\r\nelections. Leo XIII. maintained a similar attitude; and in 1895 he\r\nwent a step further by expressly forbidding what hitherto had been\r\npronounced simply inexpedient.\r\n\r\nAt no time, before or after Pope Leo's decree of prohibition, was the\r\npolicy of abstention widely enforced, and very many Catholics, both in\r\nand out of Italy, warmly opposed it. The stricture was applied only to\r\nparliamentary, not to municipal, elections; yet in the two the\r\npercentages of the enfranchised citizens who appeared at the polls\r\ncontinued to be not very unequal, and there is every reason to believe\r\nthat the meagerness of these percentages has been attributable at all\r\ntimes to the habitual indifference of the Italian electorate rather\r\nthan to the restraining effects of the papal veto. None the less, in\r\nthe strongly Catholic province of Bergamo and in some other quarters,\r\nthe papal regulations, by common admission, have cut deeply into what\r\notherwise would have been the normal parliamentary vote.\r\n\r\n*445. Relaxation of the Papal Ban.*--In the elections of 1904 many\r\nCatholics who hitherto had abstained from voting joined with the\r\nGovernment's supporters at the polls in an effort to check the growing\r\ninfluence of the more radical political groups, justifying their\r\nconduct by the conviction that the combatting of socialism is a\r\nfundamental Catholic obligation. Pope Leo XIII. was ready to admit the\r\nforce of the argument, and in June of the following year there was\r\nissued an encyclical which made it the duty of Catholics everywhere,\r\nItaly included, to share in the maintenance of social order, and\r\npermitted, and even enjoined, that they take part in political\r\ncontests in defense of social order whenever and wherever it was\r\nobviously menaced. At the same time, such participation must be, not\r\nindiscriminate, but disciplined. It must be carried on under the\r\ndirection of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and with the express\r\napproval of the Vatican. Theoretically, and as a general rule, the\r\n_Non Expedit_ remains. But where the rigid application of the law\r\nwould open the way for the triumph of the enemies of society and of\r\nreligion (as, from the papal point of view, socialists inevitably are)\r\nthe rule, upon request of the bishop and sanction by the Holy See, is\r\nto be waived. A corollary of this new policy is that, under        (p. 402)\r\ncertain circumstances, Catholics not merely vote but may stand for\r\nparliamentary seats. By the encyclical it is prescribed that such\r\ncandidacies shall be permitted only where absolutely necessary to\r\nprevent the election of an avowed adversary of the Church, only where\r\nthere is a real chance of success, and only with the approbation of\r\nthe proper hierarchical authorities; and even then the candidate shall\r\nseek office not _as_ a Catholic, but _although_ a Catholic.[576]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 576: The idea is expressed in the phrase\r\n                   _cattolici deputati, si, deputati cattolici, no_.]\r\n\r\nThe partial lifting of the _Non Expedit_ has had two obvious effects.\r\nIn the first place, it has stimulated considerably the political\r\nactivities of the Catholics. In the elections of 1906 and 1909 the\r\nnumber of Catholic voters and of Catholic candidates was larger than\r\never before, and in the Chamber of Deputies the group of clerical\r\nmembers gives promise of attaining some real importance. A second result\r\nhas been, on the other hand, a quickening of the anti-clerical spirit,\r\nwith a perceptible strengthening of the radical-republican-socialist\r\n_bloc_. By providing the Left with a solidifying issue it may yet\r\nprove that the papacy has rendered unwittingly a service to the very\r\nelements against whom it has authorized its adherents to wage\r\nrelentless war.[577]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 577: Eufrasio, Il Non Expedit, in _Nuova\r\n                   Antologia_, Sept. 1, 1904.]\r\n\r\n*446. The Election of 1909.*--In respect to the parliamentary strength\r\nof the several party groups the elections of the past decade have\r\nproduced occasional changes of consequence, but the situation to-day\r\nis not widely different from what it was at the opening of the\r\ncentury. In the Chamber elected in 1900 the Extreme Left obtained, in\r\nall, 107 seats. In 1904 the total fell to 77. In 1906, however, the\r\nRadicals secured 44, the Socialists 42, and the Republicans 23--an\r\naggregate of 109; and following the elections of March 7 and 14, 1909,\r\nthe quotas were, respectively, 37, 43, and 23, aggregating 103. The\r\nfalling-off in 1904 is to be explained principally by the activity of\r\nthe Catholics in the elections of that year, and the recovery in 1906\r\nby the fact that, sobered by their reverses, the Socialists had\r\nabandoned in the meantime the extremer phases of their revolutionary\r\npropaganda. The elections of 1909 were precipitated by Giolitti's\r\ndissolution of the Chamber, February 6, in consequence largely of the\r\ndissatisfaction of the nation with the ministry's conciliatory\r\nattitude toward Austria-Hungary following the annexation by that power\r\nof the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the excitement\r\nby which it was preceded, however, the campaign was a listless one.\r\nThe foreign situation as an issue was soon forgotten, and no\r\npreponderating national question rose to assume its place. The     (p. 403)\r\nLeft made the most of the opportunity to increase its parliamentary\r\nstrength, and the Catholics were more than ever active. The two\r\nforces, however, in a measure offset each other, and the mass of the\r\nnation, unreached by either, returned the customary overwhelming\r\nGovernmental majority. When various electoral contests had been\r\ndecided the quota of seats retained by each of the party groups in the\r\nChamber was found to be as follows: Radicals, 37; Socialists, 43;\r\nRepublicans, 23; Catholics, 16; Constitutional Opposition (separated\r\nfrom the Government upon no vital matter of principle), 42; and\r\nMinisterialists, or supporters of the Government, 346. These\r\nsupporters of the Government include men of varied political opinions,\r\nbut collectively they correspond approximately to the elements which\r\nin other countries are apt to be designated Liberals, Progressives, or\r\nModerates.[578]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 578: The political parties of Italy are\r\n                   described briefly in Lowell, Governments and\r\n                   Parties, II., Chap. 4, and at more length in King\r\n                   and Okey, Italy To-day, Chaps. 1-3.

THE CONFEDERATION AND ITS CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nAmong the governments of contemporary Europe that of the federal\r\nrepublic of Switzerland is unique; and the constitutional experiments\r\nwhich have been, and are being, undertaken by the Swiss people give\r\nthe nation an importance for the student of politics altogether out of\r\nproportion to its size and population. Nowhere in our day have been\r\nput to the test in more thoroughgoing fashion the principles of\r\nfederalism, of a plural executive, of proportional representation, of\r\nthe initiative and the referendum, and, it may be said, of radical\r\ndemocracy in general. The results attained within a sphere so\r\nrestricted, and under conditions of race, religion, and historical\r\ntradition so unusual, may or may not be accepted as evidence of the\r\nuniversal practicability of these principles. At the least, they are\r\nof acknowledged interest.\r\n\r\n*447. The Confederation in the Eighteenth Century.*--In the form in\r\nwhich it exists to-day the Swiss Confederation is a product of the\r\nmiddle and later nineteenth century. The origins of it, however, are\r\nto be traced to a very much remoter period. Beginning with the\r\nalliance of the three forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden\r\nin 1291,[579] the Confederation was built up through the gradual creation\r\nof new cantons, the splitting of old ones, the reorganization of   (p. 406)\r\ndependent territories, and the development of a federal governmental\r\nsystem, superimposed upon the constitutional arrangements of the\r\naffiliated states. In 1789, when the French Directory, at the\r\ninstigation of Napoleon, took it upon itself to revolutionize\r\nSwitzerland, the Confederation consisted of thirteen cantons.[580]\r\nWith it were associated certain _Zugewandte Orte_, or allied\r\ndistricts, some of which eventually were erected into cantons,\r\ntogether with a number of _Gemeine Vogteien_, or subject territories.\r\nThe Confederation comprised simply a _Staatenbund_, or league of\r\nessentially autonomous states. Its only organ of common action was a\r\ndiet, in which each canton had a right to one vote. Save in matters of\r\na purely advisory nature, the powers of this diet were meager indeed.\r\nOf the cantons, some were moderately democratic; others were highly\r\naristocratic. The political institutions of all were, in large\r\nmeasure, such as had survived from the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 579: For an English version of the\r\n                   Perpetual League of 1291 see Vincent, Government in\r\n                   Switzerland, 285-288.

The Helvetic Republic.*--The result of the French intervention of\r\n1798 was that, almost instantly, the loosely organized Swiss\r\nconfederation was converted into a centralized republic, tributary to\r\nFrance, and under a constitution which was substantially a\r\nreproduction of the French instrument of 1795. Under the terms of this\r\nconstitution the territories of the Confederation were split up into\r\ntwenty-three administrative districts, corresponding in but rare\r\ninstances to the earlier cantons,[581] a uniform Swiss citizenship was\r\nestablished, a common suffrage was introduced, freedom of speech and\r\nof the press was guaranteed, and unity was provided for in the\r\ncoinage, the postal service, and the penal law. A government of ample\r\npowers was set up, with its seat at Lucerne, its organs comprising a\r\nGrand Council of deputies elected indirectly in the cantons in\r\nproportion to population, a Senate of four delegates from each canton\r\n(together with retiring members of the Directory), and an Executive\r\nDirectory of five members, with whom were associated, for          (p. 407)\r\nadministrative purposes, four appointed heads of departments. The\r\nFrench intervention was ruthless and the governmental order thrust\r\nupon the Swiss had no root in national tradition or interest. The\r\nepisode served, however, to break the shackles of mediævalism and thus\r\nto contribute to the eventual establishment of a modernized\r\nnationality. July 2, 1802, following a series of grave civil\r\ndisturbances, the constitution of 1798 was superseded by a new but\r\nsimilar instrument, which was imposed by force despite an adverse\r\npopular vote.[582]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 581: To these districts, however, the\r\n                   name canton was applied; and, indeed, this was the\r\n                   first occasion upon which the name was employed\r\n                   officially in Switzerland.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 582: McCrackan, Rise of the Swiss\r\n                   Republic, 295-312; A. von Tillier, Geschichte der\r\n                   helvetischen Republik, 3 vols.

Marsauche, La confédération\r\n                   helvétique (Neuchâtel, 1890).]\r\n\r\n*449. The Act of Mediation, 1803.*--Under the circumstances reaction was\r\ninevitable, and the triumph of the \"federalists\" came more speedily\r\nthan might have been expected. In deference to preponderating\r\nsentiment in the territories, Napoleon, February 19, 1803, promulgated\r\nthe memorable Act of Mediation, whereby he authorized the\r\nre-establishment of a political system that was essentially\r\nfederal.[583] Once again there was set up a loose confederation, under\r\na constitution which, however, provided for a central government that\r\nwas distinctly more substantial than that which had prevailed prior to\r\n1798. The right, for example, to make war and to conclude treaties,\r\nwithdrawn entirely from the individual cantons, was conferred\r\nspecifically upon the federal Diet. To the thirteen original cantons\r\nwere added six new ones--Aargau, Thurgau, Vaud, Ticino, and the\r\nGrisons (St. Gall and Graubünden)--the first four formed from\r\ndistricts which under the old régime had occupied the status of\r\nsubordinate territory, the last two having been formerly \"allied\r\nstates.\" In the Diet six cantons (Bern, Zürich, Vaud, Aargau, St.\r\nGall, and Graubünden) which had a population in excess of 100,000 were\r\ngiven each two votes. All others retained a right to but one. The\r\nexecutive authority of the Confederation was vested by turns in the\r\nsix cantons of Bern, Freiburg, Lucerne, Zürich, Basel and Solothurn,\r\nthe \"directorial\" canton being known as the _Vorort_, and its chief\r\nmagistrate as the _Landammann_, of the Confederation. The principle of\r\ncentralization was in large part abandoned; but the equality of civil\r\nrights which the French had introduced was not allowed by Napoleon to\r\nbe molested. It may be observed further that by the accession of the\r\nnewly created cantons, containing large bodies of people who spoke\r\nFrench, Italian, and Romansch, the league ceased to be so          (p. 408)\r\npredominantly German as theretofore it had been.[584]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 583: It is in this instrument that the\r\n                   Confederation was for the first time designated\r\n                   officially as \"Switzerland.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 584: Cambridge Modern History, IX., Chap.\r\n                   4 (bibliography, pp. 805-807).

Jahrhundert\r\n                   (Leipzig, 1903), I.]\r\n\r\n*450. The Pact of 1815 and the Revival of Particularism.*--The Act of\r\nMediation, on the whole not unacceptable to the majority of the Swiss\r\npeople, save in that it had been imposed by a foreign power, continued\r\nin operation until 1813. During the decade Switzerland was essentially\r\ntributary to France. With the fall of Napoleon the situation was\r\naltered, and December 29, 1813, fourteen of the cantons, through their\r\nrepresentatives assembled at Zürich, declared the instrument to be no\r\nlonger in effect. Led by Bern, eight of the older cantons determined\r\nupon a return to the system in operation prior to 1798, involving the\r\nreduction of the six most recently created cantons to their former\r\ninferior status. Inspired by the Tsar Alexander I., however, the\r\nmajority of the Allies refused to approve this programme, and, after\r\nthe Congress of Vienna had arranged for the admission to the\r\nconfederacy of the three allied districts of Valais, Geneva, and\r\nNeuchâtel, there was worked out, by the Swiss themselves, a\r\nconstitution known as the \"Federal Pact,\" which was formally approved\r\nby the twenty-two cantons at Zürich, August 7, 1815.[585]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 585: This statement needs to be qualified\r\n                   by the observation that the half-canton Nidwalden\r\n                   approved the constitution August 30, and only when\r\n                   compelled by force to do so.]\r\n\r\nBy this instrument the ties which bound the federation together were\r\nstill further relaxed. The cantons regained almost the measure of\r\nindependence which they had possessed prior to the French\r\nintervention. The Diet was maintained, on the basis now of one vote\r\nfor each canton, regardless of size or population.[586] It possessed\r\nsome powers,--for example, that of declaring war or peace, with the\r\nconsent of three-fourths of the cantons,--but there were virtually no\r\nmeans by which the body could enforce the decrees which it enacted.\r\nThe executive authority of the Confederation was vested in the\r\ngovernments of the three cantons of Zürich, Lucerne, and Bern, which,\r\nit was stipulated, should serve in rotation, each during a period of\r\ntwo years. Practically all of the guarantees of common citizenship,\r\nreligious toleration, and individual liberty which the French had\r\nintroduced were rescinded, and during the decade following 1815 the\r\ntrend in most of the more important cantons was not only particularistic\r\nbut also distinctly reactionary. The smaller and poorer ones       (p. 409)\r\nretained largely their democratic institutions, especially their\r\nLandesgemeinden, or primary assemblies, but it was only after 1830,\r\nand in some measure under the stimulus of the revolutionary movements\r\nof that year, that the majority of the cantonal governments underwent\r\nthat regeneration in respect to the suffrage and the status of the\r\nindividual which lay behind the transforming movements of 1848.[587]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 586: Three of the cantons--Unterwalden,\r\n                   Basel, and Appenzell--were divided into\r\n                   half-cantons, each with a government of its own;\r\n                   but each possessed only half a vote in the Diet.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 587: B.

Attempted Constitutional Revision: the Sonderbund.*--The period\r\nbetween 1830 and 1848 was marked by not fewer than thirty revisions of\r\ncantonal constitutions, all in the direction of broader\r\ndemocracy.[588] The purposes of the liberal leaders of the day,\r\nhowever, extended beyond the democratization of the individual\r\ncantons. The thing at which they aimed ultimately was the\r\nestablishment, through the strengthening of the Confederation, of a\r\nmore effective nationality. On motion of the canton of Thurgau, a\r\ncommittee was authorized in 1832 to draft a revision of the Pact. The\r\ninstrument which resulted preserved the federal character of the\r\nnation, but provided for a permanent federal executive, a federal\r\ncourt of justice, and the centralization of the customs, postal\r\nservice, coinage, and military instruction. By a narrow majority this\r\nproject, in 1833, was defeated. It was too radical to be acceptable to\r\nthe conservatives, and not sufficiently so to please the advanced\r\nliberals.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 588: McCracken, Rise of the Swiss\r\n                   Republic, 325-330.]\r\n\r\nThe obstacles to be overcome--native conservatism, intercantonal\r\njealousy, and ecclesiastical heterogeneity--were tremendous. More than\r\nonce the Confederation seemed on the point of disruption. In\r\nSeptember, 1843, the seven Catholic cantons[589] entered into an\r\nalliance, known as the Sonderbund, for the purpose of defending their\r\npeculiar interests, and especially of circumventing any reorganization\r\nof the confederacy which should involve the lessening of Catholic\r\nprivilege; and, in December, 1845, this affiliation was converted into\r\nan armed league. In July, 1847, the Diet, in session at Bern, decreed\r\nthe dissolution of the Sonderbund; but the recalcitrant cantons\r\nrefused to abandon the course upon which they had entered, and it was\r\nonly after an eighteen-day armed conflict that the obstructive league\r\nwas suppressed.[590]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 589: Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden,\r\n                   Zug, Freiburg, and the Valais.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 590: A. Stern, Zur Geschichte des\r\n                   Sonderbundes, in _Historische Zeitschrift_, 1879;\r\n                   W. B.

The Constitution of 1848 and the Revision of 1874.*--The war (p. 410)\r\nwas worth while, because the crisis which it precipitated afforded\r\nthe liberals an opportunity to bring about the adoption of a wholly\r\nnew constitution. For a time the outlook was darkened by the\r\npossibility of foreign intervention, but by the outbreak of the\r\nrevolution of 1848 at Paris that danger was effectually removed. The\r\nupshot was that, through the agency of a committee of fourteen,\r\nconstituted, in fact, February 17, 1848--one week prior to the\r\noverthrow of Louis Philippe--the nationalists proceeded to incorporate\r\nfreely the reforms they desired in a constitutional _projet_, and this\r\ninstrument the Diet forthwith revised slightly and placed before the\r\npeople for acceptance. By a vote of 15-1/2 cantons (with a population\r\nof 1,900,000) to 6-1/2 (with a population of 290,000), the new\r\nconstitution was approved.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the constitution of 1848, ensuring a modified revival\r\nof the governmental régime of 1798-1803, comprised a distinct victory\r\nfor the Radical, or Centralist, party. During the two decades which\r\nfollowed this party maintained complete control of the federal\r\ngovernment, and in 1872 it brought forward the draft of a new\r\nconstitution whose centralizing tendencies were still more pronounced.\r\nBy popular vote this proffered constitution was rejected. Another\r\ndraft, however, was prepared and, April 19, 1874, by a vote of 14-1/2\r\ncantons against 7-1/2, it was adopted. The popular vote was 340,149 to\r\n198,013. Amended subsequently upon a large number of occasions,[591]\r\nthe instrument of 1874 is the fundamental law of the Swiss\r\nConfederation to-day, although it is essential to observe that it\r\nrepresents only a revision of the constitution of 1848. As a recent\r\nwriter has said, \"the one region on the continent to which the storms\r\nof 1848 brought immediate advantage was Switzerland, for to them it\r\nowes its transformation into a well-organized federal state.\"[592]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 591: For the methods of constitutional\r\n                   amendment see p. 431.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 592: W.

THE NATION AND THE STATES                                      (p. 411)\r\n\r\n*453. Dominance of the Federal Principle.*--In its preamble the Swiss\r\nconstitution proclaims its object to be \"to confirm the alliance of\r\nthe Confederation and to maintain and to promote the unity, strength,\r\nand honor of the Swiss nation;\" and in its second article it affirms\r\nthat it is the purpose of the Confederation \"to secure the\r\nindependence of the country against foreign nations, to maintain peace\r\nand order within, to protect the liberty and the rights of the\r\nconfederates, and to foster their common welfare.\"[593] The use of the\r\nterm \"nation\" (which, curiously, nowhere occurs in the constitution of\r\nthe United States) might seem to imply a considerably larger measure\r\nof centralization than in fact exists. For although the effect of the\r\nconstitution of 1848 was to convert a loosely organized league into a\r\nfirmly constructed state--to transform, as the Germans would say, a\r\n_Staatenbund_ into a _Bundesstaat_--the measure of consolidation\r\nattained fell, and still falls, somewhat short of that which has been\r\nrealized in the United States, and even in Germany. There are in the\r\nConfederation twenty-two cantons, of which three (Unterwalden, Basel,\r\nand Appenzell) have split into half-cantons; so that there are really\r\ntwenty-five political units, each with its own government, its own\r\nlaws, and its own political conditions. In territorial extent these\r\ncantons vary all the way from 2,773 to 14 square miles, and in\r\npopulation, from 642,744 to 13,796;[594] and the primary fact of   (p. 412)\r\nthe Swiss governmental system is the remarkable measure of political\r\nindependence which these divisions, small as well as large, possess.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 593: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, II.,\r\n                   257.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 594: The total area of the Confederation\r\n                   is approximately 16,000 square miles; the total\r\n                   population, according to the census of December 1,\r\n                   1910, is 3,741,971.]\r\n\r\n*454. The Sovereignty of the Cantons.*--In the United States there was\r\nthroughout a prolonged period a fundamental difference of opinion\r\nrelative to the sovereignty of the individual states composing the\r\nUnion. The Constitution contains no explicit affirmation upon the\r\nsubject, and views maintained by nationalists and state right's\r\nadvocates alike have always been determined of necessity by\r\ninterpretation of history and of public law. In Switzerland, on the\r\ncontrary, there is, upon the main issue, no room for doubt. \"The\r\ncantons are sovereign,\" asserts the constitution, \"so far as their\r\nsovereignty is not limited by the federal constitution; and, as such,\r\nthey exercise all the rights which are not delegated to the federal\r\ngovernment.\"[595] As in the United States, the federal government is\r\nrestricted to the exercise of powers that are delegated, while the\r\nfederated states are free to exercise any that are not delegated\r\nexclusively to the nation, nor prohibited to the states. In the Swiss\r\nconstitution, however, the delimitation of powers, especially those of\r\na legislative character, is so much more minute than in the American\r\ninstrument that comparatively little room is left for difference of\r\nopinion as to what is and what is not \"delegated.\"[596]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 595: Art. 3. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 257.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 596: In the form in which it now exists\r\n                   the Swiss constitution is one of the most\r\n                   comprehensive instruments of the kind in existence.\r\n                   Aside from various temporary provisions, it\r\n                   contains, in all, 123 articles, some of\r\n                   considerable length. As is true of the German\r\n                   constitution, there is in it much that ordinarily\r\n                   has no place in the fundamental law of a nation. A\r\n                   curious illustration is afforded by an amendment of\r\n                   1893 to the effect that \"the killing of animals\r\n                   without benumbing before the drawing of blood is\r\n                   forbidden; this provision applies to every method\r\n                   of slaughter and to every species of animals.\" Art.\r\n                   25. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, II., 263. The\r\n                   adoption of this amendment was an expression of\r\n                   antisemitic prejudice.]\r\n\r\n*455. Federal Control of the Cantons.*--After the analogy of the United\r\nStates, where the nation guarantees to each of the states a republican\r\nform of government, the Swiss Confederation guarantees to the cantons\r\ntheir territory, their sovereignty (within the limits fixed by the\r\nfundamental law), their constitutions, the liberty and rights of their\r\npeople, and the privileges and powers which the people have conferred\r\nupon those in authority. The cantons are empowered, and indeed\r\nrequired, to call upon the Confederation for the guaranty of their\r\nconstitutions, and it is stipulated that such guaranty shall be\r\naccorded in all instances where it can be shown that the constitution\r\nin question contains nothing contrary to the provisions of the     (p. 413)\r\nfederal constitution, that it assures the exercise of political rights\r\naccording to republican forms, that it has been ratified by the\r\npeople, and that it may be amended at any time by a majority of the\r\ncitizens.[597] A cantonal constitution which has not been accorded the\r\nassent of the two houses of the federal assembly is inoperative; and\r\nthe same thing is true of even the minutest amendment. The control of\r\nthe federal government over the constitutional systems of the states\r\nis thus more immediate, if not more effective, than in the United\r\nStates, where, after a state has been once admitted to the Union, the\r\nfederal power can reach its constitutional arrangements only through\r\nthe agency of the courts. Finally, in the event of insurrection the\r\ngovernment of the Confederation possesses a right to intervene in the\r\naffairs of a canton, with or without a request for such intervention\r\nby the constituted cantonal authorities. This right was exercised very\r\neffectively upon the occasion of the Ticino disorders of 1889-1890.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 597: Arts. 5 and 6. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 258.]\r\n\r\nLike the American states, but unlike the German, the Swiss cantons\r\nenjoy a complete equality of status and of rights. They are forbidden\r\nto enter into alliances or treaties of a political nature among\r\nthemselves, though they are permitted to conclude intercantonal\r\nconventions upon legislative, administrative, and judicial subjects,\r\nprovided such conventions, upon inspection by the federal officials,\r\nare found to be devoid of stipulations contrary to the federal\r\nconstitution or inimical to the rights of any canton. In the event of\r\ndisputes between cantons, the questions at issue are required to be\r\nsubmitted to the federal government for decision, and the individual\r\ncanton must refrain absolutely from the use of violence, and even from\r\nmilitary preparation.\r\n\r\n*456. Powers Vested Exclusively in the Confederation.*--Within the text\r\nof the constitution the division of powers between the federal and the\r\ncantonal governments is minute, though far from systematic. The\r\nclearest conception of the existing arrangements may perhaps be had by\r\nobserving that provision is made for three principal categories of\r\npowers: (1) those that the Confederation has an exclusive right to\r\nexercise, some being merely permissive, others obligatory; (2) those\r\nwhich the Confederation is required, or allowed, to exercise in\r\nconcurrence with the cantons; and (3) those which are not permitted to\r\nbe exercised at all.\r\n\r\nOf powers committed absolutely to the Confederation, the most\r\nimportant are those of declaring war, making peace, and concluding\r\nalliances and treaties with foreign powers, especially treaties\r\nrelating to tariffs and commerce.[598] The Confederation is        (p. 414)\r\nforbidden to maintain a standing army, and no canton, without federal\r\npermission, may maintain a force numbering more than three hundred\r\nmen. None the less, by law of 1907, every male Swiss citizen between\r\nthe ages of twenty and forty-eight is liable to military service, and\r\nthe constitution vests not only the sole right of declaring war but\r\nalso the organization and control of the national forces in the\r\nConfederation.[599] The neutralized status with which, by international\r\nagreement, Switzerland has been vested renders a war in which the\r\nnation should be involved, other, at any rate, than a civil contest,\r\nextremely improbable.[600] Within the domain of international\r\nrelations, the cantons retain the right to conclude treaties with\r\nforeign powers respecting border and police relations and the\r\nadministration of public property. All remaining phases of diplomatic\r\nintercourse are confided exclusively to the Confederation. Other\r\nfunctions vested in the federal authorities alone include the control\r\nof the postal service and of telegraphs; the coining of money and the\r\nmaintenance of a monetary system; the issue of bank notes and of other\r\nforms of paper money; the fixing of standards of weights and measures;\r\nthe maintenance of a monopoly of the manufacture and sale of\r\ngunpowder; and the enactment of supplementary legislation relating to\r\ndomicile and citizenship.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 598: Art. 8. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 258.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 599: Arts. 15-23. Ibid., II., 260-262.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 600: McCrackan, Rise of the Swiss\r\n                   Republic, 354-363; Payen, La neutralisation de la\r\n                   Suisse, in _Annales de l'École Libre des Sciences\r\n                   Politiques_, Oct. 15, 1892.]\r\n\r\n*457. Concurrent Powers and Powers Denied the Confederation.*--Among\r\npowers which are intrusted to the Confederation, to be exercised in\r\nmore or less close conjunction with the cantonal governments, are: (1)\r\nthe making of provision for public education, the cantons maintaining\r\na system of compulsory primary instruction, the Confederation\r\nsubsidizing educational establishments of higher rank;[601] (2) the\r\nregulation of child labor, industrial conditions, emigration, and\r\ninsurance; (3) the maintenance of highways; (4) the regulation of the\r\npress; and (5) the preservation of public order and of peace between\r\nmembers of different religious organizations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 601: Art. 27. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 263.]\r\n\r\nSeveral explicit prohibitions rest upon the authorities of both\r\nConfederation and cantons. No treaties may be concluded whereby it is\r\nagreed to furnish troops to other countries. No canton may expel from\r\nits own territory one of its citizens, or deprive him of his rights.\r\nNo person may be compelled to become a member of a religious society,\r\nto receive religious instruction, to perform any religious act, or to incur\r\npenalty of any sort by reason of his religious  opinions.[602] No  (p. 415)\r\ndeath penalty may be pronounced for a political offense. The\r\nprohibitions, in short, which the constitution imposes upon federal\r\nand cantonal authorities comprise essentially a bill of rights,\r\ncomparable with any to be found in a contemporary European\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 602: Art. 49. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 271-272.]\r\n\r\n*458. General Aspects.*--The fundamental thing to be observed is that\r\nunder the Swiss constitution, as under the German, the legislative\r\npowers of the federal government are comprehensive, while the\r\nexecutive authority, and especially the executive machinery, is\r\nmeager. The Confederation has power to legislate upon many\r\nsubjects--military service, the construction and operation of\r\nrailroads, education, labor, taxation, monopolies, insurance,\r\ncommerce, coinage, banking, citizenship, civil rights, bankruptcy,\r\ncriminal law, and numerous other things. In respect to taxation the\r\nfederal government possesses less power than does that of Germany, and\r\ndistinctly less than does that of the United States, for this power is\r\nconfined to the single field of customs legislation;[603] but in\r\nvirtually every other direction the legislative competence of the\r\nSwiss central authorities is more extended. It is worth observing,\r\nfurthermore, that the centralizing tendency since 1874 has found\r\nexpression in a number of constitutional amendments whose effect has\r\nbeen materially to enlarge the domain covered by federal legislation.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned the amendment of July 11, 1897, granting\r\nthe Confederation power to enact laws concerning the traffic in food\r\nproducts, that of November 13, 1898, extending the federal legislative\r\npower over the domain of civil and criminal law, that of July 5, 1908,\r\nconferring upon the Confederation power to enact uniform regulations\r\nrespecting the arts and trades (thus bringing substantially the entire\r\ndomain of industrial legislation within the province of the\r\nConfederation), and that of October 25, 1908, placing the utilization\r\nof water-power under the supervision of the central authorities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 603: \"The customs system shall be within\r\n                   the control of the Confederation. The Confederation\r\n                   may levy export and import duties.\" Art. 28. Dodd,\r\n                   Modern Constitutions, II., 263. The constitution\r\n                   stipulates further that imports of materials\r\n                   essential for the manufactures and agriculture of\r\n                   the country, and of necessaries of life in general,\r\n                   shall be taxed as low as possible; also that export\r\n                   taxes shall be kept at a minimum. Art. 42\r\n                   prescribes that the expenditures of the\r\n                   Confederation shall be met from the income from\r\n                   federal property, the proceeds of the postal and\r\n                   telegraph services, the proceeds of the powder\r\n                   monopoly, half of the gross receipts from the tax\r\n                   on military exemptions levied by the cantons, the\r\n                   proceeds of the federal customs, and, finally, in\r\n                   case of necessity, contributions levied upon the\r\n                   cantons in proportion to their wealth and taxable\r\n                   resources. Dodd, II., 269.]\r\n\r\nWithin the domain of administrative functions, the principle is    (p. 416)\r\nrather that of committing to the federal agencies a minimum of\r\nauthority. Beyond the management of foreign relations, the\r\nadministration of the customs, the postal, and the telegraph services,\r\nand of the alcohol and powder monopolies, and the control of the\r\narsenals and of the army when in the field, the federal government\r\nexercises directly but inconsiderable executive authority. It is only\r\nin relation to the cantonal governments that its powers of an\r\nadministrative nature are large; and even there they are only\r\nsupervisory. In a number of highly important matters the constitution\r\nleaves to the canton the right to make and enforce law, at the same\r\ntime committing to the Confederation the right to inspect, and even to\r\nenforce, the execution of such measures. Thus it is stipulated that\r\nthe cantons shall provide for primary instruction which shall be\r\ncompulsory, non-sectarian, and free; and that \"the Confederation shall\r\ntake the necessary measures against such cantons as do not fulfill\r\nthese duties.\"[604] Not only, therefore, does the federal government\r\nenforce federal law, through its own officials or through those of the\r\ncanton; it supervises the enactment and enforcement of measures which\r\nthe constitution enjoins upon the cantons.[605]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 604: Art. 27. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 263.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 605: A. Souriac, L'évolution de la\r\n                   juridiction fédérale en Suisse (Paris, 1909).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CANTONAL LEGISLATION: THE REFERENDUM AND THE INITIATIVE\r\n\r\n*459. Variation of Cantonal Institutions.*--In its fundamental features\r\nthe federal government of Switzerland represents largely an adaptation\r\nof the political principles and organs most commonly prevailing within\r\nthe individual cantons; from which it follows that an understanding of\r\nthe mechanism of the federation is conditioned upon an acquaintance\r\nwith that of the canton.[606] Anything, however, in the nature of a\r\ndescription which will apply to the governmental systems of all of the\r\ntwenty-five cantons and half-cantons is impossible. Variation among\r\nthem, in both structure and procedure, is at least as common and as\r\nwide as among the governments of the American commonwealths. Each\r\ncanton has its own constitution, and the Confederation is bound to\r\nguarantee the maintenance of this instrument regardless of the\r\nprovisions which it may contain, provided only, as has been pointed\r\nout, that there is in it nothing that is contrary to the federal   (p. 417)\r\nconstitution, that it establishes a republican system of government,\r\nand that it has been ratified by the people and may be amended upon\r\ndemand of a majority. The constitutions of the cantons are amended\r\neasily and frequently; but while it may be affirmed that, in\r\nconsequence of their flexibility, they tend toward more rather than\r\ntoward less uniformity, the diversity that survives among them still\r\nproclaims strikingly their separatist origin and character.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 606: On the governments of the cantons\r\n                   the principal general works are J. Schollenberger,\r\n                   Grundriss der Staats-und Verwaltungsrechts der\r\n                   schweizerischen Kantone, 3 vols. (Zürich,\r\n                   1898-1900), and J. Dubs, Das öffentliche Recht der\r\n                   schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft (Zürich,\r\n                   1877-1878), I. Brief accounts will be found in\r\n                   Vincent, the Government of Switzerland, Chaps.\r\n                   1-12.]\r\n\r\nThe point at which the governments of the cantons differ most widely\r\nis in respect to arrangements for the exercise of the functions of\r\nlegislation. Taking the nature of the legislative process as a basis\r\nof division, there may be said to be two classes of cantonal\r\ngovernments. One comprises those in which the ultimate public powers\r\nare vested in a Landesgemeinde, or primary assembly of citizens; the\r\nother, those in which such powers have been committed to a body of\r\nelected representatives. The second class, as will appear, falls again\r\ninto two groups, i.e., those in which the employment of the\r\nreferendum is obligatory and those in which it is merely optional.\r\n\r\n*460. The Landesgemeinde.*--Prior to the French intervention of 1798\r\nthere were in the Confederation no fewer than eleven cantons whose\r\ngovernment was of the Landesgemeinde type. To-day there are but six\r\ncantons and half-cantons--those, namely, of Uri, Glarus, the two\r\nUnterwaldens, and the two Appenzells. Under varying circumstances, but\r\nprincipally by reason of the increasingly unwieldy character of the\r\nLandesgemeinde as population has grown, the rest have gone over to the\r\nrepresentative system. All of those in which the institution survives\r\nare small in area and are situated in the more sparsely populated\r\nmountain districts where conditions of living are primitive and where\r\nthere is little occasion for governmental elaborateness.[607]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 607: The area of Zug is 92 square miles;\r\n                   of Glarus, 267; of the Unterwaldens, 295; of the\r\n                   Appenzells, 162. The longest dimension of any one\r\n                   of these cantons is but thirty miles, and the\r\n                   distance to be traversed by the citizen who wishes\r\n                   to attend the Landesgemeinde of his canton rarely\r\n                   exceeds ten miles. It was once the fashion to\r\n                   represent the Swiss Landesgemeinde as a direct\r\n                   survival of the primitive Germanic popular\r\n                   assembly. For the classic statement of this view\r\n                   see Freeman, Growth of the English Constitution,\r\n                   Chap. 1. There is, however, every reason to believe\r\n                   that between the two institutions there is no\r\n                   historical connection.]\r\n\r\nNominally, the Landesgemeinde is an assembly composed of all male\r\ncitizens of the canton who have attained their majority. Actually, it\r\nis a gathering of those who are able, or disposed, to be present. The\r\nassembly meets regularly once a year, in April or May, at a centrally\r\nlocated place within the canton, and usually in an open meadow. When\r\nnecessity arises, there may be convened a special session. With the\r\nmen come ordinarily the women and children, and the occasion       (p. 418)\r\npartakes of the character of a picturesque, even if solemn and\r\nceremonious, holiday. Under the presidency of the Landammann, or chief\r\nexecutive of the canton, the assembly passes with despatch upon\r\nwhatsoever proposals may be laid before it by the Landrath, or Greater\r\nCouncil. In the larger assemblies there is no privilege of debate.\r\nMeasures are simply adopted or rejected. In the smaller gatherings,\r\nhowever, it is still possible to preserve some restricted privilege of\r\ndiscussion. Unless a secret ballot is specifically demanded, voting is\r\nby show of hands. Theoretically, any citizen possesses the right to\r\ninitiate propositions. In practice, however, virtually all measures\r\nemanate from the Greater Council, and if the private citizen wishes to\r\nbring forward a proposal he will be expected to do so by suggesting it\r\nto the Council rather than by introducing it personally in the\r\nassembly. The competence of the Landesgemeinde varies somewhat from\r\ncanton to canton, but in all cases it is very comprehensive. The\r\nassembly authorizes the revision of the constitution, enacts all laws,\r\nlevies direct taxes, grants public privileges, establishes offices,\r\nand elects all executive and judicial officials of the canton.\r\nDirectly or indirectly, it discharges, indeed, all of the fundamental\r\nfunctions of government. It is the sovereign organ of a democracy as\r\nthoroughgoing as any the world has ever known.[608]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 608: H. D. Lloyd, A Sovereign People (New\r\n                   York, 1907), Chap. 4.]\r\n\r\n*461. The Greater Council.*--In every canton, whether or not of the\r\nLandesgemeinde type, there is a popularly elected representative body,\r\nthe Greater Council, which performs a larger or smaller service in the\r\nprocess of legislation. This body is variously known as the Grosser\r\nRath, the Landrath, and the Kantonsrath. In the cantons that maintain\r\nthe Landesgemeinde the functions of the Greater Council are\r\nsubsidiary. It chooses minor officials, audits accounts, and passes\r\nunimportant ordinances; but its principal business is the preparation\r\nof measures for the consideration of the Landesgemeinde. In the\r\ncantons, however, in which the Landesgemeinde does not exist, the\r\nGreater Council is a more important institution, for there it\r\ncomprises the only law-making body which is ever brought together at\r\none time or place. Where there exists the obligatory referendum, i.e.,\r\nwhere all legislative measures are submitted to a direct popular\r\nvote, the decisions of the Council are but provisional. But where the\r\nreferendum is optional the Council acquires in many matters the\r\nsubstance of final authority.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Council are elected regularly in districts by direct\r\npopular vote. The size of constituencies varies from 188 people in\r\nObwalden and 250 in Inner Appenzell to 1,500 in St. Gall and Zürich\r\nand 2,500 in Bern. The electors include all males who have         (p. 419)\r\ncompleted their twentieth year and who are in possession of full civil\r\nrights. The term of members varies from one to six years, but is\r\ngenerally three or four. There are, as a rule, two meetings annually,\r\nin some cantons a larger number. Beginning with the canton of Ticino\r\nin 1891, there has been introduced into the governmental systems of\r\nseveral cantons and of the two cities of Bern and Basel the principle\r\nof proportional representation. The details vary, but the general\r\nprinciple is that each political party shall be entitled to seats in\r\nthe Greater Council in the closest practicable proportion that the\r\nparty vote bears to the entire vote cast within the canton. Those\r\ncantons where this principle is in operation are laid out in\r\ndistricts, each of which is entitled to two or more representatives,\r\nand the individual elector, while forbidden to cast more than one vote\r\nfor a given candidate, casts a number of votes corresponding to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled.[609]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 609: For an excellent account of the\r\n                   introduction of proportional representation in the\r\n                   canton of Ticino see J. Galland, La démocratie\r\n                   tessinoise et la représentation proportionnelle\r\n                   (Grenoble, 1909). The canton in which the principle\r\n                   has been adopted most recently is St. Gall. In\r\n                   1893, 1901, and 1906 it was there rejected by the\r\n                   people, but at the referendum of February, 1912, it\r\n                   was approved, and in the following November the\r\n                   cantonal legislature formally adopted it. For a\r\n                   brief exposition of the workings of the system see\r\n                   Vincent, Government in Switzerland, Chap. 4. An\r\n                   important study of the subject is E. Klöti, Die\r\n                   Proportionalwahl in der Schweiz; Geschichte,\r\n                   Darstellung und Kritik (Bern, 1901).

The Referendum: Origins and Operation.*--The most interesting if\r\nnot the most characteristic, of Swiss political institutions is the\r\nreferendum. The origins of the referendum in Switzerland may be traced\r\nto a period at least as early as the sixteenth century. The principle\r\nwas applied first of all in the complicated governments of two\r\nterritories--the Grisons and the Valais--which have since become\r\ncantons but which at the time mentioned were districts merely\r\naffiliated with the Confederation. In the later sixteenth century\r\nthere were traces of the same principle in Bern and in Zürich. And, in\r\ntruth, the political arrangements of the early Confederation involved\r\nthe employment of a device which at least closely resembled the\r\nreferendum. Delegates sent by the cantons to the Diet were\r\ncommissioned only _ad audiendum et referendum_; that is to say, they\r\nwere authorized, not to agree finally to proposals, but simply to hear\r\nthem and to refer them to the cantonal governments for ultimate\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nIn its present form, however, the Swiss referendum originated in the\r\ncanton of St. Gall in 1830. It is distinctively a nineteenth century\r\ncreation and is to be regarded as a product of the political\r\nphilosophy of Rousseau, the fundamental tenet of which was that    (p. 420)\r\nlaws ought to be enacted, not through representatives, but by the\r\npeople directly.[610] The principle of the referendum may be applied\r\nin two essentially distinct directions, i.e., to constitutions and\r\nconstitutional amendments and to ordinary laws. The referendum as\r\napplied to constitutional instruments exists to-day in every one of\r\nthe Swiss cantons.[611] It is in no sense, however, peculiar to\r\nSwitzerland. The same principle obtains in several English-speaking\r\ncountries, as well as upon occasion elsewhere. The referendum as\r\napplied to ordinary laws, on the other hand, is distinctively Swiss.\r\nIn our own day it is being brought into use in certain of the American\r\ncommonwealths and elsewhere, but it is Swiss in origin and spirit.\r\nInaugurated in part to supply the need created by a defective system\r\nof representation and in part in deference to advanced democratic\r\ntheory, the referendum for ordinary laws exists to-day in every canton\r\nof Switzerland save only that of Freiburg. In some cantons the\r\nreferendum is obligatory, in others it is \"facultative,\" or optional.\r\nWhere the referendum is obligatory every legislative measure must be\r\nreferred to popular vote; where it is optional, a measure is referred\r\nonly upon demand of a specified number or proportion of voters. A\r\npetition calling for a referendum must be presented to the executive\r\ncouncil of the canton, as a rule, within thirty days after the\r\nenactment of the measure upon which it is proposed that a vote be\r\ntaken. The number of signers required to make the petition effective\r\nvaries from 500 in Zug to 6,000 in St. Gall. Likewise, the proportion\r\nof voters which is competent to reject a measure is variable. In some\r\ncantons a majority of all enfranchised citizens is required; in\r\nothers, a simple majority of those actually voting upon the\r\nproposition in hand. In the event of popular rejection of a measure\r\nwhich the cantonal legislature has passed, the executive council gives\r\nthe proper notice to the legislature, which thereupon pronounces the\r\nmeasure void.[612]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 610: Lowell, Governments and Parties,\r\n                   II., 243.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 611: It will be observed, of course, that\r\n                   in the cantons which maintain a Landesgemeinde\r\n                   there is no occasion for the employment of the\r\n                   referendum upon either constitutional or\r\n                   legislative questions. The people there act\r\n                   directly and necessarily upon every important\r\n                   proposition.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 612: Important treatises on the Swiss\r\n                   referendum are T.

A French version of\r\n                   the former work, by J. Ronjat, has appeared under\r\n                   the title Le référendum: histoire de la législation\r\n                   populaire en Suisse (Paris, 1905). Of large value\r\n                   is Curti, Die Resultate des schweizerischen\r\n                   Referendums (2d ed., Bern, 1911). An older account\r\n                   is J. A. Herzog, Das Referendum in der Schweiz\r\n                   (Berlin, 1885). An excellent book is S. Duploige,\r\n                   Le référendum en Suisse (Brussels, 1892), of which\r\n                   there is an English translation, by C. P.\r\n                   Trevelyan, under the title The Referendum in\r\n                   Switzerland (London, 1898). Of value also are\r\n                   Stüssi, Referendum und Initiative in den\r\n                   Schweizerkantonen (Zürich, 1894), and J. Signorel,\r\n                   Étude de législation comparée sur le référendum\r\n                   législatif (Paris, 1896). Mention may be made of J.\r\n                   Delpech, Quelques observations à propos du\r\n                   référendum et des Landesgemeinde suisse, in _Revue\r\n                   du Droit Public_, April-June, 1906.]\r\n\r\n*463. The Initiative.*--The complement of the referendum is the    (p. 421)\r\ninitiative. Through the exercise of the one the people may prevent the\r\ntaking effect of a law or a constitutional amendment to which they\r\nobject. Through the exercise of the other they may not merely bring\r\ndesired measures to the attention of the legislature; they may secure\r\nthe enactment of such measures despite the indifference or opposition\r\nof the legislative body. In current political discussion, and in their\r\nactual operation, the two are likely to be closely associated. They\r\nare, however, quite distinct, as is illustrated by the fact that the\r\nearliest adoptions of the initiative in Switzerland occurred in\r\ncantons (Vaud in 1845 and Aargau in 1852) in which as yet the\r\nreferendum did not exist. Among the Swiss cantons the right of popular\r\nlegislative initiative is now all but universal. It has been\r\nestablished in all of the cantons save Freiburg, Lucerne, and Valais.\r\nAs a rule, measures may be proposed by the same proportion of voters\r\nas is competent to overthrow a measure referred from the legislature;\r\nand any measure proposed by the requisite number of voters must be\r\ntaken under consideration by the legislature within a specified\r\nperiod. If the legislature desires to prepare a counter-project to be\r\nsubmitted to the voters along with the popularly initiated\r\nproposition, it may do so. But the original proposal must, in any\r\ncase, go before the people, accompanied by the legislature's opinion\r\nupon it; and their verdict is decisive.[613]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 613: A. Keller, Das Volksinitiativrecht\r\n                   nach den schweizerischen Kantonsverfassungen\r\n                   (Zürich, 1889).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE CANTONAL EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY\r\n\r\n*464. The Council of State.*--Executive authority within the canton is\r\nvested regularly in an administrative council, variously designated as\r\na Regierungsrath, a Standeskommission, or a Conseil d'État. The\r\nCouncil of State (employing this phrase to designate each body of the\r\nkind, however named) consists of from five to thirteen members,\r\nserving for from one to five years. In more than half of the cantons\r\nthe members are chosen by popular vote; in the rest, they are elected\r\nby the Greater Council, or legislature. By the Council of State (in a\r\nfew instances by the legislature) is chosen a chairman, or president,\r\nknown in the German cantons as the Landammann.[614] The office of\r\nLandammann is one of dignity and honor, at least locally, but it   (p. 422)\r\nis not one of large authority. The Landammann is the chief spokesman\r\nof the canton, but legally his status is scarcely superior to that of\r\nhis fellow councillors. The functions of the Council embrace the\r\nexecution of the laws, the preservation of order, the drawing up of\r\nfiscal statements, the drafting of proposed legislation, the rendering\r\nof decisions in cases on appeal, and, in general, the safeguarding of\r\nthe interests of the canton. For purposes of convenience the functions\r\nof the Council are divided among departments, to each of which one of\r\nthe councillors is assigned. All acts, however, are performed in the\r\nname of the Council as a whole. In those cantons which have\r\nfull-fledged legislative chambers councillors may attend sessions and\r\nspeak, though as a rule they may not vote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 614: In the Landesgemeinde cantons the\r\n                   Landammann is elected by the primary assembly.]\r\n\r\n*465. Local Administration.*--For purposes of administration all\r\ncantons, save a few of the smaller ones, are divided into districts\r\n(187 in the aggregate), at the head of each of which is placed a\r\nprefect or Bezirksammann. This official, whether chosen by the Council\r\nof State, by the Greater Council, or even by the people of the\r\ndistrict, is in every sense a representative of the cantonal\r\ngovernment. Sometimes he is assisted by a Bezirksrath, or district\r\ncouncil; frequently he is not. In Schwyz there is a Bezirksgemeinde,\r\nor popular assembly, in each of the six districts, but this is wholly\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nEach canton is built up of communes, or Gemeinden, and these communes,\r\n3,164 in number, comprise the most deeply rooted political units of\r\nthe country. Legally, each is composed of all male Swiss citizens over\r\ntwenty years of age resident within the communal bounds during a\r\nperiod of at least three months. The meeting of these persons is known\r\nas the Gemeindeversammlung, or the assemblée générale. By it are\r\nchosen an executive council (the Gemeinderath or conseil municipal)\r\nand a mayor (Gemeindepräsident). A principle adhered to by the\r\ncantonal governments generally is that in the work of local\r\nadministration the largest possible use shall be made of the mayors of\r\ntowns, the headmen of villages, and other minor local dignitaries.[615]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 615: Vincent, Government in Switzerland,\r\n                   Chap. 10; Adams and Cunningham, The Swiss\r\n                   Confederation, Chap. 8; Lloyd, A Sovereign People,\r\n                   Chap. 3.]\r\n\r\n*466. Justice.*--Each canton has a judicial system which is essentially\r\ncomplete within itself. Judges are elected by the people. The\r\nhierarchy of civil tribunals--the Vermittler, or justice of the peace,\r\nthe Bezirksgericht, or district court, and the Kantonsgericht--is\r\nparalleled by a hierarchy of courts for the trial of criminal cases, a\r\nspecial committee or chamber of the Kantonsgericht serving as the\r\ncriminal court of last resort. Only in few and wholly exceptional\r\ninstances may appeal be carried from a cantonal to a federal tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII                                                      (p. 423)\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\n*467. The Federal Council: the President.*--At the framing of the Swiss\r\nconstitution, as at that of the American, there arose the question of\r\na single or a plural executive. In the United States the disadvantages\r\nassumed to be inherent in an executive which should consist of a\r\nnumber of persons who were neither individually responsible nor likely\r\nto be altogether harmonious determined a decision in favor of a single\r\npresident. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the cantonal tradition\r\nof a collegiate executive, combined with an exaggerated fear of the\r\nconcentration of power, determined resort to the other alternative.\r\nThere is a president of the Swiss Confederation. But, as will appear,\r\nhis status is altogether different from that of the President of the\r\nUnited States, and likewise from that of the President of France. The\r\nSwiss executive consists rather of a Bundesrath, or Federal Council,\r\nin which the President is little more than chairman.\r\n\r\n\"The supreme directive and executive authority of the Confederation,\"\r\nsays the constitution, \"shall be exercised by a Federal Council,\r\ncomposed of seven members.\"[616] The members of the Federal Council\r\nare elected by the Federal Assembly, i.e., the National Council and\r\nthe Council of the States in joint session, from among all citizens\r\neligible to the National Council, or popular legislative body, with\r\nthe condition simply that not more than one member may be chosen from\r\nthe same canton. Nominally, the term of members is three years;\r\npractically, it is variable, for whenever the National Council is\r\ndissolved prior to the expiration of its triennial period the new\r\nAssembly proceeds forthwith to choose a new Federal Council. Two\r\nofficials, designated respectively as President of the Confederation\r\nand Vice-President of the Federal Council, are elected annually by the\r\nAssembly from among the seven members of the Council. A retiring\r\npresident may not be elected president or vice-president for the\r\nsucceeding year; nor may any member occupy the vice-presidency during\r\ntwo consecutive years. By custom the vice-president regularly      (p. 424)\r\nsucceeds to the presidency. The function of the President, as such, is\r\nsimply that of presiding over the deliberations of the Council. He has\r\nno more power than any one of his six colleagues. Like each of them,\r\nhe assumes personal direction of some one of the principal executive\r\ndepartments.[617] The only peculiarity of his status is that he\r\nperforms the ceremonial duties connected with the titular headship of\r\nthe state and draws a salary of 13,500 francs instead of the 12,000\r\ndrawn by each of the other councillors. He is in no sense a \"chief\r\nexecutive.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 616: Art. 95. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 281.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 617: No longer, as prior to 1888,\r\n                   necessarily that of foreign affairs.]\r\n\r\n*468. The Executive Departments.*--The business of the Council is\r\ndivided among the seven departments of Foreign Affairs, Interior,\r\nJustice and Police, Military Affairs, Imposts and Finance, Posts and\r\nRailways, and Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture. Each department is\r\npresided over by a member of the Council, and to each is assigned from\r\ntime to time, by the President, such subjects for consideration as\r\nproperly fall within its domain. It is stipulated by the constitution,\r\nhowever, that this distribution shall be made for the purpose only of\r\nfacilitating the examination and despatch of business. All decisions\r\nare required to emanate from the Council as a body.[618] Ordinarily a\r\ncouncillor remains at the head of a department through a considerable\r\nnumber of years,[619] and it may be added that, by reason of an\r\nincrease in the aggregate volume of governmental business, the\r\ndepartmental head enjoys to-day a larger measure of independence than\r\nformerly. A quorum of the Council consists of four members, and no\r\nmember may absent himself from a session without excuse. Except in\r\nelections, voting is _viva voce_, and an abstract of proceedings is\r\npublished regularly in the official gazette of the Republic.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 618: Art. 103. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 284. For a synopsis of the law\r\n                   of July 8, 1887, whereby an apportionment of\r\n                   functions was made among the various departments\r\n                   see Dupriez, Les Ministres, II., 239-246.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 619: Members of the Council are\r\n                   re-elected, almost as a matter of course, as long\r\n                   as they are willing to serve. Between 1848 and 1893\r\n                   the average period of service exceeded ten years.\r\n                   Lowell, Governments and Parties, II., 203.]\r\n\r\n*469. Actual Character of the Council.*--The Federal Council, although\r\nat certain points resembling a cabinet, is not a cabinet, and no such\r\nthing as cabinet government, or a parliamentary system, can be said to\r\nexist in Switzerland. The Council does, it is true, prepare measures\r\nand lay them before the Assembly. Its members even appear on the floor\r\nof the two chambers and defend these measures. But the councillors are\r\nnot, and may not be, members of the Assembly; they do not, of\r\nnecessity, represent a common political party, faith, or programme,\r\nthey are not necessarily agreed among themselves upon the merits or\r\ndemerits of a particular legislative proposal; and if overruled by (p. 425)\r\na majority of the Assembly they do not so much as think of retiring\r\nfrom office, for each member has been elected by a separate ballot for\r\na fixed term.[620] In other words, the Council is essentially what\r\nSwiss writers have themselves denominated it, i.e., an executive\r\ncommittee of the Federal Assembly. It possesses a large measure of\r\nsolidarity, but only for the purposes of routine business. Quite\r\nsuperior to it in every way--so much so that even its most ordinary\r\nadministrative measures may be set aside--is the Assembly, as against\r\nwhich the Council possesses not a shred of constitutional prerogative.\r\nIn the Assembly is vested ultimate authority, and in the event of a\r\nclash of policies what the Assembly orders the Council performs.\r\nBetween the executive and the legislative branches of the government\r\nthe relation is quite as close as it is in a parliamentary system, but\r\nthe relation is of a totally different sort.[621]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 620: The resignation, in 1891, of M.\r\n                   Welti, a member of the Council since 1867, by\r\n                   reason of the fact that the people rejected his\r\n                   project for the governmental purchase of railway\r\n                   shares occasioned general consternation.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 621: For interesting observations upon\r\n                   the advantages and disadvantages of the Swiss\r\n                   system see Lowell, Governments and Parties, II.,\r\n                   204-208.

The Council's Functions.*--The functions of the Council are at the\r\nsame time executive, legislative, and judicial. On the executive side\r\nit is the duty of the body to \"execute the laws and resolutions of the\r\nConfederation and the judgments of the Federal Court\"; to watch over\r\nthe external interests of the Confederation and to conduct foreign\r\nrelations; to safeguard the welfare, external and internal, of the\r\nstate; to make such appointments as are not intrusted to any other\r\nagency; to administer the finances of the Confederation, introduce the\r\nbudget, and submit accounts of receipts and expenses; to supervise the\r\nconduct of all officers and employees of the Confederation; to enforce\r\nthe observance of the federal constitution and the guaranty of the\r\ncantonal constitutions; and to manage the federal military\r\nestablishment. In respect to legislation it is made the duty of the\r\nCouncil to introduce bills or resolutions into the Federal Assembly\r\nand to give its opinion upon the proposals submitted to it by the\r\nchambers or by the cantons; also to submit to the Assembly at each\r\nregular session an account of its own administration, together with a\r\nreport upon the internal conditions and the foreign relations of the\r\nstate.[622] The Council possesses no veto upon the Assembly's\r\nmeasures. The judicial functions of the Council are such as arise from\r\nthe fact that there are in Switzerland no administrative courts,   (p. 426)\r\nso that the varied kinds of administrative cases which have been\r\nwithheld from the jurisdiction of the Federal Tribunal are in practice\r\ndealt with directly by the Federal Council, with appeal, as a rule, to\r\nthe Assembly.[623]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 622: Art. 102.

LEGISLATION: THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nWith specific reservation of the sovereign rights of the people and of\r\nthe cantons, the constitution vests the exercise of the supreme\r\nauthority of the Confederation in the Bundesversammlung, or Federal\r\nAssembly. Unlike the cantonal legislatures, the Federal Assembly\r\nconsists of two houses--a Nationalrath, or National Council, and a\r\nStänderath, or Council of the States.[624] The one comprises\r\nessentially a house of representatives; the other, a senate. The\r\nadoption, in the constitution of 1848, of the hitherto untried\r\nbicameral principle came about as a compromise between conflicting\r\ndemands of the same sort that were voiced in the Philadelphia\r\nconvention of 1787--the demand, that is, of the smaller federated\r\nunits for an equality of political power and that of the larger ones\r\nfor a proportioning of such power to population.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 624: In French, the Conseil National and\r\n                   the Conseil des États.]\r\n\r\n*471. The National Council: Composition and Organization.*--The National\r\nCouncil is composed of deputies chosen at a general election, for a\r\nterm of three years, by direct manhood suffrage. The constitution\r\nstipulates that there shall be one representative for every 20,000\r\ninhabitants, or major fraction thereof, and a reapportionment is made\r\nconsequent upon each decennial census. The electoral districts are so\r\nlaid out that no one comprises portions of different cantons; but they\r\nare of varying sizes and are entitled to unequal numbers of\r\nrepresentatives, according to their population. Within the district\r\nall representatives, if there are more than one, are chosen on a\r\ngeneral ticket, and the individual elector has a right to vote for a\r\nnumber of candidates equal to the number of seats to be filled. The\r\nquota of representatives falling to the various cantons under this\r\narrangement varies from one in Uri and in Zug to twenty-two in Zürich\r\nand twenty-nine in Bern. Every canton and each of the six half-cantons\r\nis entitled to at least one deputy. The total number in 1911 was 189.\r\nThe electorate consists of all male Swiss who have attained their  (p. 427)\r\ntwentieth year and who are in possession of the franchise within\r\ntheir respective cantons. The establishment of electoral districts, as\r\nwell as the regulation of the conduct of federal elections, has been\r\naccomplished, under provision of the constitution, by federal statute.\r\nVoting is in all cases by secret ballot, and elections take place\r\nalways on the same day (the last Sunday in October) throughout the\r\nentire country. An absolute majority of the votes cast is necessary\r\nfor election, save that, following two unsuccessful attempts to\r\nprocure such a majority within a district, at the third trial a simple\r\nplurality is sufficient. Except that no member of the clergy may be\r\nchosen, every citizen in possession of the federal franchise is\r\neligible to a seat in the National Council.[625] Members receive a\r\nsmall salary, which is proportioned to days of actual attendance and\r\npaid out of the federal treasury.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 625: This denial of clerical eligibility\r\n                   was inspired by fear of Catholic influences.]\r\n\r\nAt each regular or extraordinary session the National Council chooses\r\nfrom among its members a president, a vice-president, and four\r\ntellers, under the provision, however, that a member who during a\r\nregular session has held the office of president is ineligible either\r\nas president or vice-president at the ensuing regular session, and\r\nthat the same member may not be vice-president during two consecutive\r\nregular sessions. In all elections within the National Council the\r\npresident participates as any other member; in legislative matters he\r\npossesses a vote only in the event of a tie. The president,\r\nvice-president, and tellers together comprise the \"bureau\" of the\r\nCouncil, by which most of the committees are nominated, votes are\r\ncounted, and routine business is transacted.[626]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 626: Arts. 72-79. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 277-278.]\r\n\r\n*472. The Council of the States: Composition and\r\nStatus.*--Superficially, the Swiss Council of the States resembles the\r\nAmerican Senate, and it is commonly understood that the framers of the\r\nconstitution of 1848 created the institution not merely by reason of\r\nan inevitable tendency to perpetuate in some measure the purely\r\nfederal features of the old Diet, but also in consequence of a\r\ndeliberate purpose to set up a legislative body which should fulfill\r\nessentially those complementary and restraining functions which in the\r\nUnited States were assigned to the upper chamber. In point of fact,\r\nhowever, the Swiss Council has little in common with its American\r\ncounterpart. It consists of forty-four members, two chosen within each\r\ncanton; and to this extent it indeed resembles the Senate. The manner\r\nof election and the qualifications of members, however, as well as\r\ntenure of office and the arrangements made for remuneration, are not\r\nregulated, as are similar matters in the United States, by the     (p. 428)\r\nconstitution, or by federal authority, but, on the contrary, are left\r\nentirely to be determined by the individual cantons. The consequence\r\nis a total lack of uniformity in these highly important matters. In\r\nsome cantons members are elected by popular vote; in others, by the\r\nlegislative assembly. In some they are chosen for one year; in others,\r\nfor two; in still others, for three. The consequence is that the\r\nCouncil is commonly lacking in compactness and morale. More serious\r\nstill is the fact that the functions of the upper chamber are in all\r\nrespects identical with those of the lower. The American Senate has\r\npower and character of its own, quite apart from that of the House of\r\nRepresentatives; the Swiss Council has nothing of the kind. Its\r\norganization, even, is an almost exact replica of that of the lower\r\nchamber.[627] In the earlier days of the present constitutional system\r\nthe Council enjoyed high prestige and influence; but by reason of the\r\nconditions that have been described the body in time fell into\r\ndecline. Able and ambitious statesmen have preferred usually to be\r\nidentified with the lower house. The upper chamber possesses large\r\npowers--powers nominally co-ordinate with those of the lower one--and\r\nit has acted not infrequently with sufficient independence to defeat\r\nmeasures advocated by the National Council. But, without being the\r\nfeeble upper chamber that is commonly associated with a parliamentary\r\nsystem of government, it is yet essentially lacking in the initiative\r\nand independence of a true senate.[628]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 627: \"Neither the president nor the\r\n                   vice-president may be chosen at any session from\r\n                   the canton from which the president for the\r\n                   preceding session was chosen; and the\r\n                   vice-presidency may not be held during two\r\n                   successive regular sessions by representatives of\r\n                   the same canton.\" Art. 82.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 628: Arts. 80-83. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 278.]\r\n\r\n*473. Powers of the National Assembly.*--In the constitution it is\r\nstipulated that the National Council and the Council of the States\r\nshall have the right to consider all subjects placed within the\r\ncompetence of the Confederation and not assigned to any other federal\r\nauthority.[629] The range of this competence is enormous. There are,\r\nin the first place, certain functions which the two houses perform\r\nwhile sitting jointly under the direction of the president of the\r\nNational Council. These are electoral and judicial in character and\r\ncomprise (1) the election of the Federal Council, or executive\r\ncommittee of the Confederation, the federal judges, the chancellor,[630]\r\nand the generals of the federal army; (2) the granting of pardons; (p. 429)\r\nand (3) the adjustment of jurisdictional conflicts between different\r\nbranches of the federal governmental system.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 629: Art. 84. Ibid., II., 278.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 630: The principal duty of the chancellor\r\n                   is the keeping of the minutes of the National\r\n                   Council. A vice-chancellor, appointed by the\r\n                   Federal Council, performs a similar function in the\r\n                   Council of States, under responsibility to the\r\n                   chancellor.]\r\n\r\nMuch more extensive are the powers which the houses, sitting\r\nseparately, exercise concurrently. The constitution requires that the\r\ncouncils be assembled at least once annually. In practice, they meet\r\nin June and December of each year, regular sessions extending as a\r\nrule through four or five weeks. At the request of either one-fourth\r\nof the members of the National Council or of five cantons an\r\nextraordinary session must be held, and there is a probability of one\r\nsuch session each year, ordinarily in March. The powers assigned the\r\nchambers to be exercised in their concurrent capacities may be\r\nclassified variously. The more important are: (1) the enactment of\r\nlaws and ordinances upon the organization and election of federal\r\nauthorities and upon all subjects which by the constitution are placed\r\nwithin the federal competence; (2) the conduct of foreign relations,\r\nparticularly the concluding of treaties and alliances with foreign\r\npowers, the supervision of conventions entered into by the cantons (in\r\nthe event that the Federal Council, or any canton, protests against\r\nsuch cantonal arrangements), the declaring of war and the concluding\r\nof peace, and the taking of measures for the safety, independence, and\r\nneutrality of the Confederation; (3) the control of the federal army;\r\n(4) the adoption of the annual budget, the authorizing of federal\r\nloans, and the auditing of public accounts; (5) the taking of measures\r\nfor the enforcement of the provisions of the federal constitution, for\r\nthe carrying out of the guaranty of the cantonal constitutions, for\r\nthe fulfillment of federal obligations, and for the supervision of the\r\nfederal administration and of the federal courts; and (6) the revision\r\nof the federal constitution.[631] It will be perceived that the powers\r\nexercised by the chambers are principally legislative, but also in no\r\nsmall degree executive and judicial; that, as has already been\r\nemphasized, the two councils comprise the real directive agency of the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 631: Art. 85, §§ 1-14. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 278-279.]\r\n\r\n*474. The Assembly's Procedure.*--Federal laws, decrees, and resolutions\r\nare passed only by agreement of the two councils. Any measure may\r\noriginate in either house and may be introduced by any member. There\r\nare committees upon various subjects, but bills are referred to them\r\nonly by special vote. Committee members are chosen by the chamber directly\r\nor by the chamber's \"bureau,\" as the chamber itself may determine. In\r\neach house a majority constitutes a quorum for the transaction of\r\nbusiness, and measures are passed by a simple majority. Sittings,  (p. 430)\r\nas a rule, are public. It is expressly forbidden that members shall\r\nreceive from their constituents, or from the cantonal governments,\r\ninstructions respecting the manner in which they shall vote.[632]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 632: For a brief account of the procedure\r\n                   of the chambers see Vincent, Government in\r\n                   Switzerland, 181-187.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LEGISLATION: THE REFERENDUM AND THE INITIATIVE\r\n\r\nFrom the domain of cantonal legislative procedure there has been\r\ncarried over into federal law-making the fundamental principle of the\r\nreferendum. The federal referendum exists to-day in two forms, i.e.,\r\nthe optional and the obligatory. The one appeared for the first time\r\nin the revised constitution of 1874 and is applicable exclusively to\r\nprojects of ordinary legislation. The other was established by the\r\nconstitution of 1848 and is applicable solely to proposed amendments\r\nof that instrument.\r\n\r\n*475. The Optional Referendum: Laws and Resolutions.*--After a law which\r\nhas been enacted by the Federal Assembly has been published it enters\r\nregularly upon a probationary period of ninety days during which,\r\nunder stipulated conditions, it may be referred directly to the people\r\nfor ratification or rejection. The only exceptions are afforded by\r\nthose measures which, by declaration of the councils, are of a private\r\nrather than a general character, and those which are \"urgent.\" Such\r\nacts take effect at once. But all others are suspended until there\r\nshall have been adequate opportunity for the carrying through of a\r\nreferendum. At any time within the ninety-day period a referendum may\r\nbe demanded, either by the people directly or by the cantonal\r\ngovernments. Petitions signed by as many as 30,000 voters, or adopted\r\nby the legislatures of as many as eight cantons, render it obligatory\r\nupon the Federal Council to arrange for the submission of a measure to\r\na referendum within four weeks after the announcement of the demand\r\nhas been made. The method of the referendum is carefully prescribed by\r\nfederal legislation. Every citizen in possession of unimpaired civil\r\nrights is entitled to vote, and the voting takes place under the\r\nsupervision of the authorities of the commune and of the canton. If in\r\na majority of the cantons a preponderance of votes is cast in favor of\r\nthe measure in hand, the Federal Council proclaims the fact and the\r\nmeasure goes at once into operation. An adverse majority, on the other\r\nhand, renders the measure null. In the event that no referendum is\r\ndemanded, the measure, of course, goes automatically into effect at\r\nthe expiration of the ninety-day period. Since its introduction    (p. 431)\r\ninto the federal constitution the principle of the legislative\r\nreferendum has been brought to bear upon a not inconsiderable number\r\nof legislative projects. The proportion, indeed, of laws falling\r\nwithin the range of the system which have been subjected to the\r\npopular vote, while varying widely from time to time, has been not far\r\nfrom ten per cent; and of the measures actually voted upon several of\r\nimportance have been rejected. In all instances the demand has arisen\r\ndirectly from citizen petitioners, not from the cantonal\r\ngovernments.[633]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 633: On the operation of the optional\r\n                   referendum see Lowell, Governments and Parties,\r\n                   II., 252-261. \"From 1874 till 1908 the Federal\r\n                   Assembly passed 261 bills and resolutions which\r\n                   could constitutionally be subjected to the\r\n                   referendum. Thirty of these 261 were actually voted\r\n                   on by the people, who ratified eleven and rejected\r\n                   nineteen of them. The effect of the federal\r\n                   optional legislative referendum was, then, to hold\r\n                   up a little more than seven per cent of the\r\n                   statutory output of the Federal Assembly.\" W. E.\r\n                   Rappard, in _American Political Science Review_,\r\n                   Aug., 1912, 357. On the most recent exercise of the\r\n                   federal referendum (the adoption, February 4, 1912,\r\n                   of a national Accident and Sickness Insurance bill)\r\n                   see M. Turmann, Le référendum suisse du 4\r\n                   février--la loi fédérale sur l'assurance-maladie et\r\n                   l'assurance accident, in _Le Correspondant_, Feb.\r\n                   10, 1912. This particular referendum was called for\r\n                   by 75,000 voters. The measure submitted was\r\n                   approved by a vote of 287,566 to 241,416, on a poll\r\n                   of 63.04 per cent of the registered electorate.]\r\n\r\n*476. The Obligatory Referendum: Constitutional Amendments.*--In its\r\napplication to laws and resolutions the referendum is optional; in\r\napplication to constitutional amendments it is obligatory. Revision of\r\nthe Swiss constitution may be accomplished at any time, in whole or in\r\npart, and in a variety of modes. In the event that the legislative\r\ncouncils are able to agree upon a scheme of revision they vote the\r\nadoption of the proposed amendment precisely as if it were an ordinary\r\nstatute, and it is thereupon submitted to the people for acceptance or\r\nrejection. If, however, the two houses disagree upon the question of a\r\ntotal revision, or if as many as 50,000 voters make demand for a total\r\nrevision, there must be put to the people the preliminary question as\r\nto whether there shall be a revision at all. If the will of the\r\nmajority is affirmative, new legislative councils must be elected, and\r\nto them falls the obligation of executing the popular mandate.\r\n\r\nWhen the question is one of but partial revision the procedure is\r\nsomewhat different. Partial revision may be instituted either by the\r\ncouncils or by petition of 50,000 voters. When a popular petition is\r\npresented there are four possible courses of action: (1) if the\r\nproject is presented in general terms and the councils are in\r\nagreement upon it, they reduce the proposal to specific form and\r\nsubmit it to the people; (2) if the councils are not in agreement  (p. 432)\r\nupon the project they put to the people the preliminary question of\r\nwhether an amendment of the general type proposed is desirable, and if\r\nthe vote is affirmative they proceed with the revision; (3) if the\r\npetition is presented in a form that is specific and final and the\r\ncouncils are in agreement upon it, the project is submitted forthwith\r\nto the people; and (4) if the councils are not in agreement upon a\r\nspecific project so advanced, they may prepare a project of their own,\r\nor recommend the rejection of the proposed amendment, and they may\r\nsubmit their counter-project or their recommendation at the same time\r\nthat the initiative petition is presented to the people.[634] In no\r\ncase may an amendment be put into effect until it has received the\r\nassent of a majority of those voting thereon in a majority of the\r\ncantons. Of seventeen constitutional amendments submitted by the\r\nFederal Assembly between 1874 and 1908 twelve were ratified and five\r\nwere rejected.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 634: Arts. 118-123. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 287-289.]\r\n\r\n*477. The Popular Initiative.*--The right of popular initiative in the\r\nrevision of the constitution was established by an amendment of July\r\n5, 1891, through the united efforts of all the anti-Radical parties\r\nand groups. The purpose underlying the amendment was to break the\r\nmonopoly long enjoyed by the Radicals by placing within the hands of\r\nany fifty thousand citizens the power to compel the federal government\r\nto take under consideration proposed modifications of the\r\nconstitution, to prepare projects relating to them, and to submit\r\nthese projects to the ultimate decision of the people. When the system\r\nwas established many persons seriously feared that the way had been\r\nthrown open for frequent, needless, and revolutionary change, by which\r\nthe stability of the state would be impaired. Such apprehension,\r\nhowever, has been proved groundless. During a score of years only nine\r\npopularly-initiated amendments have been voted upon, and only three\r\nhave been incorporated in the fundamental law. One of the three,\r\nadopted in 1893, prohibited the Jewish method of slaughtering animals,\r\nand was purely a product of the antisemitic movement. The other two\r\nwere adopted in 1908. One authorized for the first time legislation by\r\nthe federal authorities upon subjects relating to the trades and\r\nprofessions; the other prohibited the manufacture and sale of\r\nabsinthe. A number of other more or less sweeping amendments, it is\r\ntrue, have been proposed, but all alike have failed of adoption. Thus,\r\nin 1894, perished a socialistic scheme whereby the state was to\r\nobligate itself to provide employment for every able-bodied man, and\r\nin the same year, a project to pay over to the cantons a bonus of two\r\nfrancs per capita from the rapidly increasing returns of the       (p. 433)\r\ncustoms duties.[635] Similarly, in 1900, failed two interesting\r\nprojected reforms relating to the federal electoral system. One of\r\nthese provided for the introduction, in the various cantons, of the\r\nprinciple of proportional representation in the election of members of\r\nthe National Council. The other provided for the election of the\r\nmembers of the Federal Council, not, as at present, by the General\r\nAssembly, but by direct popular vote, the whole mass of electors\r\nvoting, not by cantons, but as one national constituency. In June,\r\n1900, both of these electoral proposals were rejected by the\r\nlegislative chambers, and in the ensuing November the people ratified\r\nthe rejection. In 1903, there was defeated in the same way a proposal\r\nto base representation in the National Council, not upon the total\r\npopulation of the country, but upon the Swiss population alone. In\r\n1909-10 the proportional representation project was revived, but with\r\na negative result.[636]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 635: C. Borgeaud, Le plébiscite du 4\r\n                   novembre 1894, in _Revue du Droit Public_,\r\n                   Nov.-Dec., 1894. The adverse votes were decisive,\r\n                   i.e., 308,289 to 75,880 and 347,401 to 145,362\r\n                   respectively.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 636: The introduction of proportional\r\n                   representation in Switzerland is advocated\r\n                   especially by the Socialists and the Clericals, to\r\n                   whom principally would accrue the benefits of the\r\n                   system. The Liberals are favorable to the\r\n                   principle, though they prefer to postpone the\r\n                   issue. The Radicals are solidly opposed. At the\r\n                   referendum of 1900 the project was rejected by\r\n                   11-1/2 to 10-1/2 cantons, and by a popular majority\r\n                   of 75,000; at that of October 23, 1910, it was\r\n                   approved by 12 to 10 cantons, but was rejected\r\n                   popularly by a majority of less than 25,000\r\n                   (265,194 negative, 240,305 affirmative). Rather\r\n                   curiously, the defeat arose largely from the\r\n                   defection of the Catholic canton of Freiburg, which\r\n                   in 1900 was favorable by a vote of 13,000 to 3,800.\r\n                   The canton's vote in 1910 was for rejection, by\r\n                   11,200 to 3,900. By those best acquainted with the\r\n                   situation this astonishing reversal is explained by\r\n                   the influence which is exercised in the canton\r\n                   to-day by M. Python, a dictator who opposes any\r\n                   innovation whereby his own controlling position\r\n                   would be menaced. Not unnaturally, the friends of\r\n                   the project (and in 1910 all parties save the\r\n                   Radicals gave it their support) regard the outcome\r\n                   in 1910 as a certain forecast of eventual victory.\r\n                   In nine of the cantonal governments, beginning with\r\n                   that of Ticino in 1891, the principle has been\r\n                   already put in operation. In truth, the defeat of\r\n                   1910 was followed promptly by a triumph in the\r\n                   important canton of St. Gall, where the\r\n                   proportional system was adopted for the first time,\r\n                   February 5, 1911, for elections of the cantonal\r\n                   council.

Daneo,\r\n                   La rappresentanza proporzionale nella Svizzera, in\r\n                   _Nuova Antologia_, Sept. 16, 1910.]\r\n\r\nAmong reforms that have been much discussed in recent years has been\r\nthe extension of the initiative and of the obligatory referendum to\r\nall federal legislation. Both apply as yet only to constitutional\r\namendments. In 1906 the Federal Council went so far as to submit to\r\nthe legislative councils a proposal intended to meet the first of\r\nthese ends. The purport of the proposal was that fifty thousand\r\nvoters, or eight cantons, should have the right at any time to     (p. 434)\r\ndemand the passage, modification, or repeal of any sort of federal\r\nlaw or federal decree. In December, 1906, the project was debated in\r\nthe National Council; after which it was referred to the Federal\r\nCouncil for further consideration. The proposal is still pending, but\r\nits eventual adoption is probable.[637]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 637: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, II.,\r\n                   280-281.

POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*478. Centralism vs. Federalism.*--Until the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the most fundamental of political questions in modern\r\nSwitzerland was that of centralization, and the most enduring of\r\npolitical cleavages among the people was that which marked off the\r\n\"centralists\" from the \"federalists.\" There was a time when the\r\nannihilation of the cantons and the establishment of a thoroughly\r\nconsolidated state was not only openly advocated but confidently\r\npredicted. With the establishment, however, of the reasonable\r\ncompromise embodied in the constitution of 1848 the issue of\r\ncentralization dropped pretty much into the background. There\r\ncontinued to be, and still are, \"centralizers;\" but the term has come\r\nlong since to denote merely men who, with due regard for the\r\nsusceptibilities of the cantons, direct their influence habitually to\r\nthe strengthening of the central agencies of government.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of 1848 was the work of a combination of centralist\r\nelements which acquired the general designation of Radicals. Opposed\r\nto the Radicals were the federalist Moderates. Between 1848 and 1874\r\ncontrolling influence was maintained steadily by the Radicals,\r\nalthough during the decade 1850-1860 there was a fusion of parties in\r\nconsequence of which there existed through many years an extremely\r\nintricate political situation. Gradually there emerged a three-fold\r\nparty grouping, which has survived uninterruptedly from the era of the\r\nconstitutional revision of 1874 until our own day. The three parties,\r\nas aligned now through more than a generation in the National Council,\r\nare: (1) the Right, or Clericals; (2) the Left, or Radicals; and (3)\r\nthe Centre, or Liberals. To these, in very recent times, must be added\r\na small but growing group of the Extreme Left, comprising\r\nultra-democrats and socialists.\r\n\r\n*479. The Parties of To-day.*--The basis of segregation of the Right is\r\nprimarily religious. The party is thoroughly clerical, and it has for\r\nits fundamental object the defense of the Catholic church and the  (p. 435)\r\ninterests of the Catholic population. In the Catholic cantons it\r\noccupies the field almost alone, and everywhere it is the most compact\r\nand zealous of the parties, although even it is not without a certain\r\namount of division of opinion and of policy. The Left, or Radical\r\nparty, has always represented a combination of widely varied shades of\r\nradicalism and democracy. Its greatest strength lies in the\r\npredominantly Protestant cantons, and it is distinctly anti-clerical.\r\nLarge portions of the party have ceased long since to be really\r\nradical, although on one side there is an imperceptible shading off\r\ninto the ranks of the advanced democrats and socialists. Through many\r\nyears the party has been lacking notoriously in cohesion. Between the\r\nConservative Right and the Radical Left stands the Centre, or the\r\nLiberal group, lacking most notably of all in unity, but preserving\r\nthe traditional Swiss principles of personal freedom in defiance of\r\nthe tendency of the state in the direction of paternalism. The\r\nLiberals are not strong numerically, but they comprise men of wealth\r\nand influence (largely conservative Protestants), and in the shaping\r\nof economic policies, in which they are interested principally, they\r\nsometimes exercise a powerful influence. During the years immediately\r\nfollowing the constitutional revision of 1874 no one of these three\r\nparties possessed in the Federal Assembly a clear majority, with the\r\nconsequence that the Centre was able to maintain a balance between the\r\nother two. Gradually, however, the Radicals regained their former\r\nascendancy, and in subsequent years their preponderance, in especially\r\nthe lower chamber, has tended steadily to be increased.\r\n\r\n*480. Party Stability and Strength.*--Concerning the political parties\r\nof Switzerland two or three things are worthy of special observation.\r\nThe first is the remarkable stability which these parties, despite\r\ntheir obvious lack of cohesion, exhibit from the point of view both of\r\nparty identity and of party strength. Except the Socialists, who have\r\nceased to vote and act with the Radicals, there has sprung into\r\nexistence not one new political party since 1874. Numerous and varied\r\nas have been the political issues of these four decades, no one of\r\nthem has given rise to a new party grouping. And, save for the gradual\r\naugmentation of Radical strength to which allusion has been made,\r\nthere has been in this period no noteworthy change in the relative\r\nstrength of the party groups. Sudden fluctuations, such as in other\r\ncountries are common, are in Switzerland quite unknown. The reasons\r\nare varied and not wholly clear, but among them seem to be the brevity\r\nof national legislative sessions, the lack of federal patronage\r\nwhereby party zeal may be whetted, the indirect method of electing the\r\nFederal Council, and the essentially non-partisan character of the (p. 436)\r\nreferendum.[638] Party strength in the National Council following the\r\nelection of 1878 was: Clericals, 35; Liberals, 31; Radicals, 69. After\r\nthe election of 1881 it was: Clericals, 36; Liberals, 26; and\r\nRadicals, 83. In these proportions the six triennial elections between\r\n1884 and 1902 produced no important change, although in 1890 the\r\nSocialists broke somewhat into the balance by winning six seats. After\r\nthe census of 1900 the number of members of the Council was raised\r\nfrom 147 to 167, and the results of the election of 1902 were as\r\nfollows: Clericals, 35; Liberals, 25; Radicals, 97; Socialists, 9; and\r\nIndependents, 1. In 1905 the Radicals, who hitherto had co-operated\r\nwith the Socialists in many constituencies, broke with them upon the\r\nquestion of military policy, with the result that the Socialist\r\ncontingent in the Council was cut to two. In 1908 and 1911 the\r\nSocialists made, however, some recovery; so that, on the whole, the\r\nparty situation in the Council remains to-day very nearly what it was\r\nten years ago. By popular suffrage the Radicals are continued\r\nuninterruptedly in control, although the people do not hesitate again\r\nand again to reject measures framed by Radical administrators and\r\nlaw-makers and submitted to the vote of the nation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 638: Upon this subject, especially the\r\n                   effects of the referendum upon political parties,\r\n                   see Lowell, Governments and Parties, II., 314-332.]\r\n\r\n*481. The Inactivity of Parties.*--A second important fact respecting\r\nthe parties of Switzerland is their all but total lack of organization\r\nand machinery. Parties are little more than groups of people who hold\r\nsimilar views upon public questions. Of office-seekers there are few,\r\nand of professional politicians fewer still. Elections are not\r\ninfrequently uncontested, and only at rare intervals do they serve to\r\nawaken any considerable public enthusiasm. There are no campaign\r\nmanagers and funds, no platforms, no national committees, no elaborate\r\nsystems of caucuses or conventions. Candidates for seats in the\r\nNational Council are nominated by political gatherings in the several\r\ndistricts, but the proceedings are frequently of an all but purely\r\nnon-partisan character. Political congresses are held occasionally,\r\nand a few political associations exist, but their activities are\r\nlimited and comparatively unimportant. So far as there is party vigor\r\nat all, it is expended principally upon local issues and contests\r\nwithin the cantons.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be observed that the Swiss government is not a\r\ngovernment by party at all. The Federal Council regularly includes\r\nmembers of more than one party, and there is no attempt to preserve in\r\nthe body a homogeneous partisan character. Even in the legislative\r\ncouncils considerations of party are but incidental. Upon by no means\r\nall public issues are party lines drawn, and where they are drawn  (p. 437)\r\nthere is seldom that compactness and discipline of party to which\r\nlegislative assemblies in other nations are accustomed. An evidence of\r\nthe secondary importance of party demarcation is afforded by the fact\r\nthat, instead of being arranged in groups according to party\r\naffiliations, the members of the National Council are so placed, as a\r\nrule, that all of the deputies of a canton occupy contiguous seats.\r\nThe Federal Council, being elected by the Federal Assembly, is\r\npractically certain to reflect the preponderating political complexion\r\nof that body. But, in the entire absence of the parliamentary system,\r\nthere is no essential reason why politically the executive and\r\nlegislative organs should be in accord.[639]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 639: On Swiss political parties see\r\n                   Lowell, Governments and Parties, II., Chap. 13;\r\n                   Adams and Cunningham, The Swiss Confederation,\r\n                   Chap. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\n*482. The Federal Court: Civil Jurisdiction.*--In respect to\r\norganization, the Swiss federal judiciary is very simple; in respect\r\nto functions, it is extremely complex. It comprises but a single\r\ntribunal, the Bundesgericht, or Federal Court. The court, created\r\noriginally in 1848, consists to-day of sixteen judges and nine\r\nalternates, all chosen by the Federal Assembly for a term of six\r\nyears. Any citizen eligible to the National Council may be elected to\r\nthe Federal Court, but it is incumbent upon the Assembly to take care\r\nthat all of the three officially recognized languages--German, French,\r\nand Italian--are represented. The president and vice-president of the\r\ncourt are designated by the Assembly, for a two years' term, but the\r\ncourt is authorized to organize its own secretariat and to appoint the\r\nofficials thereof. Judges are forbidden to sit in either house of the\r\nfederal legislature, to occupy any other office, or to engage in any\r\nalien pursuit or profession. Their yearly salary is 12,000 francs. The\r\nseat of the Court is Lausanne, in the French province of Vaud.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Federal Court extends not only to ordinary\r\ncivil and criminal cases but also to cases arising under public law.\r\nThe competence of the tribunal in civil cases is very considerable. It\r\nextends to all suits between the Confederation and the cantons;\r\nbetween the Confederation and corporations or individuals, when such\r\ncorporations or individuals appear as plaintiffs, and when the amount\r\ninvolved exceeds 3,000 francs; between cantons; and between cantons\r\nand corporations or individuals, upon request of the parties, and when\r\nthe amount involved exceeds 3,000 francs. The constitution authorizes\r\nthe Confederation to enlarge, by legislation, the competence of    (p. 438)\r\nthe Court,[640] and from time to time a variety of specific fields of\r\ncivil jurisdiction have been opened to it, such as those of\r\ntransportation and bankruptcy. In addition to original jurisdiction in\r\nall matters that have been named, the Court is required by the\r\nconstitution to exercise appellate jurisdiction in cases carried on\r\nappeal, by mutual consent of the parties, from the cantonal courts.\r\nFor the adjudication of civil cases the Court divides itself into two\r\nchambers of seven members each, presided over respectively by the\r\npresident and vice-president.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 640: Art. 114. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 287.]\r\n\r\n*483. Criminal and Public Law Jurisdiction.*--The tribunal's criminal\r\njurisdiction is less extensive. It covers, in the main, cases of high\r\ntreason against the Confederation, crimes and misdemeanors against the\r\nlaw of nations, political crimes and misdemeanors of such seriousness\r\nas to occasion armed federal intervention, and charges against\r\nofficers appointed by a federal authority, when such authority makes\r\napplication to the Federal Court. In cases falling within any one of\r\nthese categories the Court is required to employ a jury to decide\r\nquestions of fact. With the consent of the Federal Assembly, criminal\r\ncases of other kinds may be referred to the Federal Court by the\r\ncantonal governments. For the trial of criminal cases the Court is\r\ndivided each year into four chambers, each of three members, save the\r\nfourth and highest, the Kassationshof, or Court of Appeals, which has\r\nfive. The Confederation is divided into three Assizenbezirke, or\r\nassize districts, and from time to time one of the criminal chambers\r\nsits in each.\r\n\r\nWithin the domain of public law the Court is given cognizance of\r\nconflicts of jurisdiction between federal and cantonal authorities,\r\nconflicts between cantons when arising out of questions of public law,\r\ncomplaints of violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, and\r\ncomplaints of individuals by reason of the violation of concordates or\r\ntreaties. In actual operation, the range of powers which would appear\r\nthus to be conferred is much restricted by a clause which declares\r\nthat \"conflicts of administrative jurisdiction are reserved, and are\r\nto be settled in a manner prescribed by federal legislation.\"[641]\r\nLegislation in pursuance of this clause has withdrawn from the\r\njurisdiction of the Court a long list of possible subjects of\r\nlitigation. Like European courts generally, the Swiss Federal Court\r\npossesses no power to determine the constitutionality of law, federal\r\nor cantonal. On the contrary, it is obligated to apply all law, by\r\nwhatever proper authority enacted.[642]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 641: Art. 112. Ibid., II., 286.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 642: On the Swiss federal judiciary see\r\n                   Vincent, Government in Switzerland, Chap. 15; Adams\r\n                   and Cunningham, The Swiss Confederation, Chap. 5.]\r\n\r\n*484. The Civil Code.*--In 1898 the nation, through the means of   (p. 439)\r\na referendum, adopted the principle of the unification of all cantonal\r\nlegal systems, civil and criminal, in a set of federal codes. Through\r\nmore than a decade the task has been in progress, drafts being\r\nprepared by experts and submitted from time to time for criticism to\r\nspecial commissions and to public opinion. Early in 1908 the Assembly\r\nadopted an elaborate Civil Code which in this way had been worked out,\r\nand January 1, 1912, this monumental body of law was put in operation.\r\nBy it many long established practices within the individual cantons\r\nwere abolished or modified; but the humane and progressive character\r\nof the Code won for it such a measure of public approval that there\r\nwas not even demand that the instrument be submitted to a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI--AUSTRIA-HUNGARY                                           (p. 441)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY PRIOR TO THE AUSGLEICH\r\n\r\n\r\n*485. The Dual Monarchy.*--The dual monarchy Austria-Hungary, comprising\r\na sixteenth of the area, and containing an eighth of the population,\r\nof all Europe, is an anomaly among nations. It consists, strictly, of\r\ntwo sovereign states, each of which has a governmental system all but\r\ncomplete within itself. One of these is known officially as \"The\r\nKingdoms and Lands represented in the Reichsrath,\" but more familiarly\r\nas Cisleithania, or the Empire of Austria. The other, officially\r\ndesignated as \"The Lands of St. Stephen's Crown,\" is commonly called\r\nTransleithania, or the Kingdom of Hungary. By certain historical and\r\npolitical ties the two are bound together under the official name of\r\nthe Österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie, or Austro-Hungarian\r\nMonarchy.[643] In the one the common sovereign is Emperor; in the\r\nother, Apostolic King.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 643: This designation was first employed\r\n                   in a diploma of the Emperor Francis Joseph I.,\r\n                   November 14, 1868 (see p. 459).]\r\n\r\n\"If,\" says a modern writer, \"France has been a laboratory for\r\npolitical experiments, Austria-Hungary is a museum of political\r\ncuriosities, but it contains nothing so extraordinary as the relation\r\nbetween Austria and Hungary themselves.\"[644] In its present form this\r\nrelation rests upon the memorable Ausgleich, or Compromise, of 1867.\r\nThe historical phases of it, however, may be traced to a period as\r\nremote as the first half of the sixteenth century, when, in 1526,\r\nafter the Hungarians had suffered overwhelming defeat by the Turks at\r\nthe Battle of Mohács, a Hapsburg prince, the later Emperor Ferdinand\r\nI., assumed, upon election by the Hungarian diet, the throne of the\r\ndemoralized eastern kingdom.[645] Until the eighteenth century the\r\nunion of the two monarchies was always precarious, much of the time\r\npractically non-existent. Set in the midst of a whirlpool of races and\r\npolitical powers, the ancient Hungarian state, recovered from its days\r\nof disaster, struggled unremittingly to preserve its identity, and\r\neven to regain its independence, as against the overshadowing      (p. 442)\r\nImperial authority of which Austria was the seat. The effort was\r\nfairly successful and as late as the Napoleonic period Hungary, while\r\nbound to her western neighbor by a personal union through the crown,\r\nmaintained not only her essential autonomy but even the constitutional\r\nstyle of government which had been hers since at least the early\r\nportion of the thirteenth century. A rapid sketch of the earlier\r\npolitical development of the two states seems a necessary introduction\r\nto an examination of the institutions, joint and separate, which\r\nto-day enter into the texture of their governmental organization.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 644: Lowell, Governments and Parties,\r\n                   II., 177.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 645: See p. 448.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. AUSTRIAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT TO 1815\r\n\r\n*486. Origins.*--The original Austria was a mark, or border county,\r\nlying along the south bank of the Danube, east of the river Enns, and\r\nfounded by Charlemagne as a bulwark of the Frankish kingdom against\r\nthe Slavs. During the ninth century the territory was overrun\r\nsuccessively by the Moravians and the Magyars, or Hungarians, and all\r\ntraces of Frankish occupation were swept away. At the middle of the\r\ntenth century, however, following Otto the Great's signal triumph over\r\nthe Hungarians on the Lech in 955, the mark was reconstituted; and\r\nfrom that point the development of modern Austria is to be traced\r\ncontinuously. The name Österreich, i.e., \"eastern empire\" or\r\n\"dominion,\" appears in a charter as early as 996.\r\n\r\nThe first notable period of Austrian history was that covered by the\r\nrule of the house of Babenberg. The government of the mark was\r\nintrusted by the Emperor Otto II. to Leopold of Babenberg in 976, and\r\nfrom that date to the extinction of the family in 1246 the energies of\r\nthe Babenbergs were absorbed principally in the enlargement of the\r\nboundaries of their dominion and in the consolidation of its\r\nadministration. In 1156 the mark was raised by King Frederick I. to\r\nthe dignity of a duchy, and such were the privileges conferred upon it\r\nthat the duke's only obligation consisted in the attending of any\r\nImperial diet which should be held in Bavaria and the sending of a\r\ncontingent to the Imperial army for such campaigns as should be\r\nundertaken in countries adjoining the duchy.\r\n\r\n*487. The Establishment of Hapsburg Dominion, 1276.*--In 1251--five\r\nyears after the death of the last Babenberg--the estates of the duchy\r\nelected as duke Ottakar, son of Wenceslaus I., king of Bohemia. In\r\n1276, however, Duke Ottakar was compelled to yield his three dominions\r\nof Austria, Styria, and Carinthia to Rudolph of Hapsburg, who, in 1273,\r\nupon the breaking of the Interregnum, had become German king and\r\nemperor; and at this point began in Austria the rule of the        (p. 443)\r\nillustrious Hapsburg dynasty of which the present Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph is a representative. Under the adroit management of Rudolph the\r\ncenter of gravity of Hapsburg power was shifted permanently from the\r\nRhine to the Danube, and throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages\r\nthe history of Austria is a story largely of the varying fortunes of\r\nthe Hapsburg interests. In 1453 the duchy was raised to the rank of an\r\narchduchy, and later in the century the Emperor Maximilian I.\r\nentertained plans for the establishment of an Austrian electorate, or\r\neven an Austrian kingdom. These plans were not carried into execution,\r\nbut the Austrian lands were constituted one of the Imperial circles\r\nwhich were created in 1512, and in 1518 representatives of the various\r\nAustrian Landtage, or diets, were gathered for the first time in\r\nnational assembly at Innsbrück.\r\n\r\n*488. Austro-Hungarian Consolidation.*--In 1519 Maximilian I. was\r\nsucceeded in the archduchy of Austria, as well as in the Imperial\r\noffice, by his grandson Charles of Spain, known thenceforth as the\r\nEmperor Charles V. To his brother Ferdinand, however. Charles resigned\r\nthe whole of his Austrian possessions, and to Austrian affairs he gave\r\nthroughout his reign but scant attention. Ferdinand, in turn, devoted\r\nhimself principally to warfare with the Turks and to an attempt to\r\nsecure the sovereignty of Hungary. His efforts met with a measure of\r\nsuccess and there resulted that affiliation of Austria and Hungary\r\nwhich, though varying greatly from period to period in strength and in\r\neffect, has been maintained to the present day. During a century\r\nsucceeding Ferdinand's accession to the Imperial throne in 1556, the\r\naffairs of Austria were inextricably intertwined with those of the\r\nEmpire, and it was only with the virtual disintegration of the Empire\r\nin consequence of the Thirty Years' War that the Hapsburg sovereigns\r\nfell back upon the policy of devoting themselves more immediately to\r\nthe interests of their Austrian dominion.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this policy were manifest during the long reign of\r\nLeopold I., who ruled in Austria from 1655 to 1705 and was likewise\r\nemperor during the last forty-eight years of this period. At the close\r\nof a prolonged series of Turkish wars, the Peace of Karlowitz, January\r\n26, 1699, added definitely to the Austrian dominion Slavonia,\r\nTransylvania, and all Hungary save the banat of Temesvár, and thus\r\ncompleted the edifice of the Austrian monarchy.[646] The period was\r\nlikewise one of internal consolidation. The Diet continued to be   (p. 444)\r\nsummoned from time to time, but the powers of the crown were augmented\r\nenormously, and it is to these years that scholars have traced the\r\norigins of that thoroughgoing bureaucratic régime which, assuming more\r\ndefinite form under Maria Theresa, continued unimpaired until the\r\nrevolution of 1848. It was in the same period that the Austrian\r\nstanding army was established.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 646: At the diet of Pressburg, in\r\n                   1687-1688, the Hungarian crown had been declared\r\n                   hereditary in the house of Hapsburg, and the\r\n                   Austrian heir, Joseph, had been crowned hereditary\r\n                   king. In 1697 Transylvania was united to the\r\n                   Hungarian monarchy. The banat of Temesvár was\r\n                   acquired by the Hapsburgs in 1718. The term \"banat\"\r\n                   denotes a border district, or march.]\r\n\r\n*489. Development of Autocracy Under Maria Theresa, 1740-1780.*--The\r\nprincipal threads in Austrian history in the eighteenth century are\r\nthe foreign entanglements, including the war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, the war of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years'\r\nWar, and the internal measures, of reform and otherwise, undertaken by\r\nthe successive sovereigns, especially Maria Theresa (1740-1780) and\r\nJoseph II. (1780-1790). For Austria the net result of the wars was the\r\nloss of territory and also of influence, among the states of the\r\nEmpire, if not among those of all Europe. On the side of internal\r\naffairs it may be observed simply that Maria Theresa became virtually\r\nthe founder of the unified Austrian state, and that, in social\r\nconditions generally, the reign of this sovereign marks more largely\r\nthan that of any other the transition in the Hapsburg dominions from\r\nmediæval to modern times. Unlike her doctrinaire son and successor,\r\nJoseph, Maria Theresa was of an eminently practical turn of mind. She\r\nintroduced innovations, but she clothed them with the vestments of\r\nancient institutions. She made the government more than ever\r\nautocratic, but she did not interfere with the nominal privileges of\r\nthe old estates. In Hungary the constitution was left untouched, but\r\nduring the forty years of the reign the Diet was assembled only four\r\ntimes, and government was, in effect, by royal decree. Joseph II.\r\nassumed the throne in 1780 bent primarily upon a policy of \"reform\r\nfrom above.\" Utterly unacquainted with the actual condition of his\r\ndominions and unappreciative of the difficulties inherent in their\r\nadministration, the new sovereign set about the sweeping away of the\r\nentire existing order and the substituting of a governmental scheme\r\nwhich was logical enough, to be sure, but entirely impracticable. The\r\nattempt, as was inevitable, failed utterly.\r\n\r\n*490. Austria and France, 1789-1815.*--Leopold II. inherited, in 1790, a\r\ndominion substantially as it was at the death of Maria Theresa. Prior\r\nto his accession Leopold had acquired a reputation for liberalism, but\r\napprehension aroused by the revolution in France was of itself\r\nsufficient to turn him promptly into the traditional paths of Austrian\r\nautocracy. His reign was brief (1790-1792), but that of his son and\r\nsuccessor, Francis II., which continued through the revolutionary\r\nepoch, was essentially a continuation of it, and from first to     (p. 445)\r\nlast there was maintained with complete success that relentless\r\npolicy of \"stability\" so conspicuously associated later with the name\r\nof Metternich. Hardly any portion of Europe was less affected by the\r\nideas and transformations of the Revolution than was Austria.\r\n\r\nHaving resisted by every means at her disposal, including resort to\r\narms, the progress of revolution, Austria set herself firmly,\r\nlikewise, in opposition to the ambitions of Napoleon. Of the many\r\nconsequences of the prolonged combat between Napoleon and the Hapsburg\r\npower, one only need be mentioned here. August 11, 1804, Francis II.,\r\narchduke of Austria and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, assumed the\r\nname and title of Francis I., emperor of Austria. To the taking of\r\nthis step the Hapsburg monarch was influenced in part by Napoleon's\r\nassumption, three months previously, of the title of emperor of the\r\nFrench, and in part by anticipation that the Holy Roman Empire would\r\nsoon be subverted completely by the conqueror. The apprehension proved\r\nwell-founded. Within two years it was made known definitely that the\r\nNapoleonic plan of international readjustment involved as one of its\r\nprincipal features the termination, once for all, of an institution\r\nwhich, as Voltaire had already said, was \"no longer holy, Roman, or an\r\nempire.\" August 6, 1806, the title and functions of Holy Roman Emperor\r\nwere relinquished formally by the Austrian monarch. The Austrian\r\nimperial title of to-day, dates, however, from 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HUNGARIAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT TO 1815\r\n\r\n*491. Beginnings.*--According to accounts which are but indifferently\r\nreliable, the Magyars, or Hungarians, lately come as invaders from\r\nAsia, made their first appearance in the land which now bears their\r\nname in the year 895. Certain it is that during the first half of the\r\ntenth century they terrorized repeatedly the populations of Germany\r\nand France, until, in 955, their signal defeat at the Lechfeld by the\r\nGerman king (the later Emperor Otto I.) checked effectually their\r\nonslaughts and re-enforced the disposition already in evidence among\r\nthem to take on a settled mode of life. In the second half of the\r\ntenth century they occupied definitely the valleys of the Danube and\r\nthe Theiss, wedging apart, as do their descendants to this day, the\r\nSlavs of the north and those of the Balkan regions.\r\n\r\n*492. Institutional Growth Under Stephen I., 997-1038.*--The principal\r\nformative period in the history of the Hungarian nation is the long\r\nreign of Stephen I., or, as he is more commonly known, St. Stephen.\r\nIn this reign were established firmly both the Hungarian state and (p. 446)\r\nthe Hungarian church; and in the organization of both Stephen\r\nexhibited a measure of capacity which entitles him to high rank among\r\nthe constructive statesmen of mediæval Europe. Under his predecessor\r\nthe court had accepted Roman Christianity, but during his reign the\r\nnation itself was Christianized and the machinery of the Church was\r\nfor the first time put effectively in operation. In the year 1001 Pope\r\nSylvester II. accorded formal recognition to Magyar nationality by\r\nbestowing upon Prince Stephen a kingly crown, and to this day the\r\njoint sovereign of Austria-Hungary is inducted into office as\r\nHungarian monarch with the identical crown which Pope Sylvester\r\ntransmitted to the missionary-king nine centuries ago. In the\r\nelaboration of a governmental system King Stephen and the advisers\r\nwhom he gathered from foreign lands had virtually a free field. The\r\nnation possessed a traditional right to elect its sovereign and to\r\ngather in public assembly, and these privileges were left untouched.\r\nNone the less, the system that was set up was based upon a conception\r\nof royal power unimpaired by those feudal relationships by which in\r\nwestern countries monarchy was being reduced to its lowest estate. The\r\nold Magyar tribal system was abolished and as a basis of\r\nadministration there was adopted the Frankish system of counties. The\r\ncentral and western portions of the country, being more settled, were\r\ndivided into forty-six counties, at the head of each of which was\r\nplaced a count, or lord-lieutenant (_föispán_), appointed by the crown\r\nand authorized in turn to designate his subordinates, the castellan\r\n(_várnagy_), the chief captain (_hadnagy_), and the hundredor\r\n(_százados_). This transplantation of institutions is a matter of\r\npermanent importance, for, as will appear, the county is still the\r\nbasal unit of the Hungarian administrative system.\r\n\r\n*493. The Golden Bull, 1222.*--During the century and a half which\r\nfollowed the reign of Stephen the consolidation of the kingdom,\r\ndespite frequent conflicts with the Eastern Empire, was continued. The\r\ncourt took on something of the brilliancy of the Byzantine model, and\r\nin the later twelfth century King Béla III. inaugurated a policy--that\r\nof crowning as successor the sovereign's eldest son while yet the\r\nsovereign lived--by which were introduced in effect the twin\r\nprinciples of heredity and primogeniture. In 1222 King Andrew II.\r\n(1204-1235) promulgated a famous instrument, the _Bulla Aurea_, or\r\nGolden Bull, which has been likened many times to the Great Charter\r\nconceded to his barons by King John of England seven years earlier.\r\nThe precise purport of the Golden Bull is somewhat doubtful. By some\r\nthe instrument has been understood to have comprised a virtual\r\nsurrender on the part of the crown in the interest of a class of   (p. 447)\r\ninsolent and self-seeking nobles with which the country was cursed. By\r\nothers it has been interpreted as a measure designed to strengthen the\r\ncrown by winning the support of the mass of the lesser nobles against\r\nthe few greater ones.[647] The exemption of all nobles from taxation\r\nwas confirmed; all were exempted likewise from arbitrary arrest and\r\npunishment. On the other hand, it was forbidden expressly that the\r\ntitles and holdings of lords-lieutenant should become hereditary. The\r\nmost reasonable conclusion is that the instrument represents a\r\ncompromise designed to afford a working arrangement in a period of\r\nunusual stress between crown and nobility. Although the document was\r\namplified in 1231 and its guarantees were placed under the special\r\nguardianship of the Church, it does not appear that its positive\r\neffects in the period immediately following were pronounced. The\r\nGolden Bull, none the less, has ever been regarded as the foundation\r\nof Hungarian constitutional liberty. As such, it was confirmed\r\nspecifically in the coronation oath of every Hapsburg sovereign from\r\nthe sixteenth to the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 647: J. Andrássy, Development of\r\n                   Hungarian Constitutional Liberty (London, 1908),\r\n                   93.]\r\n\r\n*494. Three Centuries of Constitutional Unsettlement.*--The last century\r\nof the Árpád dynasty, which was ended in 1308, was a period of\r\ndepression and of revolution. The weakness of the later Árpáds, the\r\nruin wrought by the Tatar invasion of 1241-1242, the infiltration of\r\nfeudalism, and perennial civil discord subverted the splendid\r\nmonarchical establishment of King Stephen and brought the country into\r\nvirtual subjection to a small body of avaricious nobles. The Árpáds\r\nwere succeeded by two Angevin princes from the kingdom of\r\nNaples--Charles I. (1310-1342) and Louis I. (1342-1382)--under whom\r\nnotable progress was made toward the rehabilitation of the royal\r\npower. Yet in the midst of their reforms appeared the first\r\nforeshadowings of that great Turkish onslaught by which eventually the\r\nindependent Hungarian monarchy was destined to be annihilated\r\ncompletely. The long reign of Sigismund (1387-1437) was occupied\r\nalmost wholly in resistance to the Ottoman advance. So urgent did this\r\nsovereign deem the pushing of military preparations that he fell into\r\nthe custom of summoning the Diet once, and not infrequently twice, a\r\nyear, and this body acquired rapidly a bulk of legislative and fiscal\r\nauthority which never before had been accorded it. Persons entitled to\r\nmembership were regularly the nobles and higher clergy. But in 1397\r\nthe free and royal towns were invited to send deputies, and this\r\nprivilege seems to have been given statutory confirmation. By the\r\nripening of the Hungarian feudal system, however, and the          (p. 448)\r\nstruggles for the throne which followed the death of King Albert V.\r\n(1439), much that was accomplished by Sigismund and his diets was\r\nundone. Ultimately, measures of vigilance were renewed under John\r\nHunyadi,--by voice of the Diet \"governor\" of Hungary, 1446-1456,--and,\r\nunder his son King Matthias I. (1458-1490). During the last-mentioned\r\nreign fifteen diets are known to have been held, and no fewer than 450\r\nstatutes to have been enacted. The Hungarian common law was codified\r\nafresh and the entire governmental system overhauled. But again\r\nsucceeded a period, from the accession of Wladislaus II. to the battle\r\nof Mohács, during which turbulence reigned supreme and national spirit\r\nall but disappeared.\r\n\r\n*496. The Establishment of Austrian Dominion.*--In 1526 the long\r\nexpected blow fell. Under the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent the\r\nTurks invaded the Hungarian kingdom and at the battle of Mohács,\r\nAugust 28, put to rout the entire Hungarian army. The invading hosts\r\nchose to return almost instantly to Constantinople, but when they\r\nwithdrew they left one-quarter of the Hungarian dominion in utter\r\ndesolation. It was at this point, as has been stated, that the\r\nHapsburg rulers of Austria first acquired the throne of Hungary. The\r\ndeath of King Louis at Mohács was followed by the election of John\r\nZapolya as king. But the archduke Ferdinand, whose wife, Anne, was a\r\nsister of Louis, laid claim to the throne and, in November, 1527,\r\ncontrived to procure an election thereto at the hand of the Diet. In\r\n1529 the deposed Zapolya was reinstated at Buda by the Sultan. The\r\nupshot was civil war, which was terminated in 1538 by a treaty under\r\nwhose terms the kingdom was divided between the two claimants. Zapolya\r\nretained approximately two-thirds of the country, while to Ferdinand\r\nwas conceded the remaining portion, comprising Croatia-Slavonia and\r\nthe five westernmost counties. The government which Zapolya maintained\r\nat Buda had rather the better claim to be considered the continuation\r\nof the old Hungarian monarchy; but from 1527 onwards some portion of\r\nHungary, and eventually the whole, was attached regularly to the\r\nHapsburg crown.\r\n\r\nIn 1540 Zapolya died and the Diet at Buda elected as king his infant\r\nson John Sigismund. On the basis of earlier pledges Ferdinand laid\r\nclaim to Zapolya's possessions, but the Sultan intervened and in 1547\r\nthere was worked out a three-fold division of the kingdom, on the\r\nprinciple of _uti possedetis_, under which thirty-five counties\r\n(including Croatia and Slavonia) were assigned to Ferdinand,\r\nTransylvania and sixteen adjacent counties were retained by John\r\nSigismund, while the remaining portions of the kingdom were annexed to\r\nthe dominions of the Sultan. With frequent modifications in detail,\r\nthis three-fold division persisted through the next century and a  (p. 449)\r\nhalf. The period was marked by frequent wars, by political confusion,\r\nand by the assumption on the part of the Hapsburg sovereigns of an\r\nincreasingly autocratic attitude in relation to their Hungarian\r\ndependencies. It was brought to a close by the Peace of Karlowitz,\r\nJanuary 26, 1699, whereby the Hapsburg dynasty acquired dominion over\r\nthe whole of Hungary, except the banat of Tamesvár, which was acquired\r\nnineteen years later.\r\n\r\n*496. Austrian Encroachment: the Pragmatic Sanction.*--The immediate\r\neffect of the termination of the Turkish wars was to enhance yet\r\nfurther the despotism of the Hapsburgs in Hungary. In 1687 the Emperor\r\nLeopold I. induced a rump diet at Pressburg to abrogate that clause of\r\nthe Golden Bull which authorized armed resistance to unconstitutional\r\nacts of the sovereign, and likewise to declare the Hungarian crown\r\nhereditary in the house of Hapsburg. After upwards of seven hundred\r\nyears of existence, the elective Hungarian monarchy was brought thus\r\nto an end. In 1715 King Charles III.[648] persuaded the Diet to\r\nconsent to the establishment of a standing army, recruited and\r\nsupported under regulation of the Diet but controlled by the Austrian\r\ncouncil of war. By the diet of 1722 there was established a Hungarian\r\ncourt of chancery at Vienna and the government of Hungary was\r\ncommitted to a stadtholder at Pressburg who was made independent of\r\nthe Diet and responsible to the sovereign alone. The diet of 1722\r\nlikewise accepted formally the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 by which the\r\nEmperor Charles settled the succession to his hereditary dominions, in\r\ndefault of male heirs, upon his daughter Maria Theresa and her\r\nheirs;[649] and in measures promulgated during the succeeding year the\r\nEmperor entered into a fresh compact with his Hungarian subjects which\r\ncontinued the basis of Hapsburg-Hungarian relations until 1848. On the\r\none hand, Hungary was declared inseparable from the Hapsburg\r\ndominions, so long as there should be a legal heir; on the other, the\r\ncrown was sworn to preserve the Hungarian constitution intact, with\r\nall the rights, privileges, laws, and customs of the kingdom. The net\r\nresult of all of these measures, none the less, was to impair\r\nperceptibly the original autonomy of the Hungarian state.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 648: Charles VI. as emperor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 649: The Pragmatic Sanction was accepted\r\n                   at different dates by the various diets of the\r\n                   Austro-Hungarian lands: in 1713 by Croatia, and\r\n                   from 1720 to 1724 by the other diets. It was\r\n                   finally proclaimed a fundamental law in 1724.]\r\n\r\n*497. The Later Eighteenth Century.*--Maria Theresa cherished a genuine\r\ninterest in Hungarian affairs and was deeply solicitous concerning the\r\nwelfare of her Hungarian subjects. It was never her intent, however,\r\nto encourage Hungarian self-government. The constitution of the    (p. 450)\r\nkingdom was not subverted; it was simply ignored. The Diet was\r\nsummoned but seldom, and after 1764 not at all. Reforms were\r\nintroduced, especially in connection with education, but through the\r\nmedium of royal decrees alone. Joseph II. continued nominally the\r\npolicy of enlightened despotism, but in so tactless a manner that most\r\nof his projects were brought to nought. Approaching the problem of\r\nHungarian administration with his accustomed idealism, he undertook\r\ndeliberately to sweep away not only the constitution of the kingdom\r\nbut the whole body of Hungarian institutions and traditions. He\r\nrefused even to be crowned king of Hungary or to recognize in any\r\nmanner the established status of the country. His purpose was clearly\r\nto build of Austria and Hungary one consolidated and absolute state--a\r\npurpose which, it need hardly be remarked, failed of realization. The\r\nstatesmanship of Leopold II. averted the impending revolt. The\r\nconstitution was restored, the ancient liberties of the kingdom were\r\nconfirmed, and it was agreed that the Diet should be assembled\r\nregularly every three years. Through a quarter of a century the\r\nprincipal interest of Leopold's successor, Francis II. (1792-1835),[650]\r\nwas the waging of war upon revolutionary France and upon Napoleon, and\r\nduring this period circumstances conspired to cement more firmly the\r\nrelations between the Hapsburg monarchy and the Hungarian people. In\r\nHungary, as in Austria, the time was one of political stagnation.\r\nPrior to 1811 the Diet was several times convened, but never for any\r\npurpose other than that of obtaining war subsidies.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 650: As emperor of Austria, Francis I.\r\n                   (1804-1835).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE ERA OF METTERNICH\r\n\r\nIn the thoroughgoing reaction which set in with the Congress of Vienna\r\nit fell to Austria to play the principal rôle. This was in part\r\nbecause the dominions of the Hapsburgs had emerged from the\r\nrevolutionary epoch virtually unscathed, but rather more by reason of\r\nthe remarkable position occupied during the period 1815-1848 by\r\nEmperor Francis I.'s minister and mentor, Prince Metternich. Easily\r\nthe most commanding personality in Europe, Metternich was at the same\r\ntime the moving spirit in international affairs and the autocrat of\r\nAustro-Hungarian politics. Within both spheres he was, as he declared\r\nhimself to be, \"the man of the _status quo_.\" Innovation he abhorred;\r\nimmobility he glorified. The settlement at Vienna he regarded as\r\nessentially his own handiwork, and all that that settlement involved\r\nhe proposed to safeguard relentlessly. Throughout a full generation he\r\ncontrived, with consummate skill, to dam the stream of liberalism in\r\nmore than half of Europe.\r\n\r\n*498. Condition of the Monarchy in 1815.*--In the dominions of the (p. 451)\r\nHapsburgs the situation was peculiarly such as to render all change,\r\nfrom the point of view of Metternich, revolutionary and ruinous. In\r\nrespect to territory and prestige Austria emerged from the Napoleonic\r\nwars with a distinctly improved status. But the internal condition of\r\nthe monarchy, now as ever, imparted a forbidding aspect to any policy\r\nor movement which should give promise of unsettling in the minutest\r\ndegree the delicate, haphazard balance that had been arrived at among\r\nthe multiplicity of races, religions, and interests represented in the\r\nEmperor's dominions. In the west were the duchies, essentially German,\r\nwhich comprised the ancestral possessions of the Hapsburg dynasty; in\r\nthe north was Bohemia, comprising, besides Bohemia proper, Silesia,\r\nand Moravia, and containing a population largely Czech; to the south\r\nlay the lately acquired Italian kingdom of Lombardo-Venetia; to the\r\neast lay the kingdom of Hungary, including the kingdom of Croatia and\r\nthe principality of Transylvania, with a population preponderantly\r\nSlavic but dominated politically by the Magyars. Several of these\r\ncomponent states retained privileges which were peculiar to themselves\r\nand were bound to the Hapsburg monarchy by ties that were at best\r\nprecarious. And the differences everywhere of race, religion,\r\nlanguage, tradition, and interest were such as to create for the\r\nVienna Government a seemingly impossible task.\r\n\r\nSo decadent and ineffective was the Austrian administrative system\r\nwhen Metternich entered, in 1809, upon his ministry that not even he\r\ncould have supposed that change would not eventually have to come.\r\nChange, however, he dreaded, because when change begins it is not\r\npossible to foresee how far it will go, or to control altogether the\r\ncourse it shall follow. Change, therefore, Metternich resisted by\r\nevery available means, putting off at least as long as might be the\r\nevil day. The spirit of liberalism, once disseminated throughout the\r\nconglomerate Empire, might be expected to prompt the various\r\nnationalities to demand constitutions; constitutions would mean\r\nautonomy; and autonomy might well mean the end of the Empire itself.\r\nAustria entered upon the post-Napoleonic period handicapped by the\r\nfact that the principle upon which Europe during the nineteenth\r\ncentury was to solve many of her problems--the principle of\r\nnationality--contained for her nought but the menace of\r\ndisintegration. Conservatism, as one writer has put it, was imposed\r\nupon the Empire by the very conditions of its being.\r\n\r\n*499. Metternich's System: the Rise of Liberalism.*--The key to Austrian\r\nhistory during the period 1815--1848 is, then, the maxim of the\r\nEmperor Francis, \"Govern and change nothing.\" In Hungary government\r\nwas nominally constitutional; elsewhere it was frankly absolute.   (p. 452)\r\nThe diets of the component parts of the Empire were not abolished, nor\r\nwere the estates of the several Austrian provinces. But, constituted\r\nas they generally were on an aristocratic basis and convened but\r\nirregularly and for brief periods, their existence was a source\r\nneither of embarrassment to the Government nor of benefit to the\r\npeople. \"I also have my Estates,\" declared the Emperor upon one\r\noccasion. \"I have maintained their constitution, and do not worry\r\nthem; but if they go too far I snap my fingers at them or send them\r\nhome.\" The Diet of Hungary was not once convened during the years\r\n1812-1825. On the side of administration Metternich did propose that\r\nthe various executive departments, hitherto gathered under no common\r\nmanagement nor correlated in any degree whatsoever, should be brought\r\nunder the supervision of a single minister. But not even this project\r\nwas carried out effectively. Throughout the period the central\r\ngovernment continued cumbersome, disjointed, and inefficient.\r\n\r\nWith every passing decade the difficulties of the Government were\r\naugmented. Despite a most extraordinary censorship of education and of\r\nthe press, western liberalism crept slowly into the Empire and the\r\nspirit of disaffection laid hold of increasing numbers of people. The\r\nrevolutions of 1820 passed without eliciting response; those of 1830\r\noccasioned but a ripple. But during the decade 1830-1840, and\r\nespecially after 1840, the growth of liberalism was rapid. In 1835 the\r\naged Francis I. was succeeded by Ferdinand I., but as the new\r\nsovereign was mentally incapacitated the dominance of Metternich\r\ncontinued unimpaired.[651] In Bohemia, Hungary, and elsewhere there\r\nwere revivals of racial enthusiasm and of nationalistic aspirations\r\nwhich grew increasingly ominous. The Hungarian diet of 1844\r\nsubstituted as the official language of the chambers Magyar for Latin,\r\nand during the forties there was built up, under the leadership of\r\nLouis Kossuth and Francis Deák, a flourishing Liberal party, whose aim\r\nwas the re-establishment of the autonomy of the kingdom and the\r\nthoroughgoing reform of the government. By 1847-1848 this party was\r\ninsisting strenuously upon the adoption of its \"Ten Points,\" in which\r\nwere included a responsible ministry, the abolition of serfdom,\r\nequality of citizens before the law, complete religious liberty,\r\nfuller representation in the Diet, taxation of the nobles, and     (p. 453)\r\ncontrol by the Diet of all public expenditures.[652]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 651: Technically the control of the\r\n                   government was vested in a small group of\r\n                   dignitaries known as the Staatskonferenz, or State\r\n                   Conference. The nominal president of this body was\r\n                   the Archduke Louis, representing the crown; but the\r\n                   actual direction of its proceedings fell to\r\n                   Metternich.

Under the\r\nelectrifying effect of the news of the fall of Louis Philippe at Paris\r\n(February 24), and of the eloquent fulminations of Kossuth, translated\r\ninto German and scattered broadcast in the Austrian capital, there\r\nbroke out at Vienna, March 12-13, an insurrection which instantly got\r\nquite beyond the Government's power to control. Hard fighting took\r\nplace between the troops and the populace, and an infuriated mob,\r\nbreaking into the royal palace, called with an insistence that would\r\nnot be denied for the dismissal of Metternich. Recognizing the\r\nuselessness of resistance, the minister placed in the hands of the\r\nEmperor his resignation and, effecting an escape from the city, made\r\nhis way out of the country and eventually to England. March 15 there\r\nwas issued a hurriedly devised Imperial proclamation, designed to\r\nappease the populace, in which was promised the convocation of an\r\nassembly with a view to the drafting of a national constitution.\r\n\r\n*501. Hungary: the March Laws.*--On the same day the Diet of Hungary,\r\nimpelled by the oratory of Kossuth, began the enactment of an\r\nelaborate series of measures--the so-called March Laws--by which was\r\ncarried rapidly toward completion a programme of modernization which,\r\nin the teeth of Austrian opposition, had been during some years under\r\nway. The March Laws fell into two principal categories. The first\r\ndealt with the internal government of the kingdom, the second with the\r\nrelations which henceforth were to subsist between Hungary and the\r\nAustrian Empire. For the ancient aristocratic machinery of the\r\nmonarchy was substituted a modern constitutional system of government,\r\nwith a diet whose lower chamber, of 337 members, was to be elected by\r\nall Hungarians of the age of twenty who possessed property to the\r\nvalue of approximately $150. Meetings of this diet were to be annual\r\nand were to be held, no longer at Pressburg, near the Austrian border,\r\nbut at the interior city of Budapest, the logical capital of the\r\nkingdom. Taxation was extended to all classes; feudal servitudes and\r\ntitles payable by the peasantry were abolished; trial by jury,\r\nreligious liberty, and freedom of the press were guaranteed. In the\r\nsecond place, it was stipulated that henceforth Hungary should     (p. 454)\r\nhave an entirely separate and a responsible ministry, thus ensuring\r\nthe essential autonomy of the kingdom. The sole tie remaining between\r\nthe two monarchies was to be the person of the sovereign. Impelled by\r\nthe force of circumstances, the Government at Vienna designated Count\r\nLouis Batthyány premier of the first responsible Hungarian ministry\r\nand, April 10, accorded reluctant assent to the March Laws. These\r\nstatutes, though later subverted, became thenceforth the _Grundrechte_\r\nof the Hungarian people.\r\n\r\n*502. The Austrian Constitution of 1848.*--In the meantime, the\r\nAustrians were pressing their demand for constitutionalism. The\r\nframing of the instrument which had been promised was intrusted by the\r\nEmperor to the ministers, and early in April there was submitted to an\r\ninformal gathering of thirty notables representing various portions of\r\nthe Empire a draft based upon the Belgium constitution of 1831. This\r\ninstrument was given some consideration in several of the provincial\r\ndiets, but was never submitted, as it had been promised in the\r\nmanifesto of March 15 it should be, to the Imperial Diet, or to any\r\nsort of national assembly. Instead it was promulgated, April 25, on\r\nthe sole authority of the Emperor. The territories to which it was\r\nmade applicable comprised the whole of the Emperor's dominions, save\r\nHungary and the other Transleithanian lands and the Italian\r\ndependencies. By it the Empire was declared an indissoluble\r\nconstitutional monarchy, and to all citizens were extended full rights\r\nof civil and religious liberty. There was instituted a Reichstag, or\r\ngeneral diet, to consist of an upper house of princes of the royal\r\nfamily and nominees of the landlords, and a lower of 383 members, to\r\nbe elected according to a system to be devised by the Reichstag\r\nitself. All ministers were to be responsible to this diet. July 22\r\nthere was convened at Vienna the first assembly of the new type, and\r\nthe organization of constitutional government was put definitely under\r\nway.\r\n\r\n*503. The Reaction.*--Recovery, however, on the part of the forces of\r\nreaction was rapid. In Hungary the same sort of nationalistic feeling\r\nthat had inspired the Magyars to assert their rights as against\r\nAustria inspired the Serbs, the Croats, and the Roumanians to demand\r\nfrom the Magyar Government a recognition of their several traditions\r\nand interests. The purpose of the Magyars, however, was to maintain\r\nabsolutely their own ascendancy in the kingdom, and every demand on\r\nthe part of the subject nationalities met only with contemptuous\r\nrefusal. Dissatisfaction bred dissension, and dissension broke\r\nspeedily into civil war. With consummate skill the situation was\r\nexploited by the Vienna Government, while at the same time the armies\r\nof Radetzky and Windischgrätz were stamping out every trace of     (p. 455)\r\ninsurrection in Lombardo-Venetia, in Bohemia, and eventually in Vienna\r\nitself. December 2, 1848, the easy-going, incompetent Emperor\r\nFerdinand was induced by the reactionaries to abdicate. His brother,\r\nFrancis Charles, the heir-presumptive, renounced his claim to the\r\nthrone, and the crown devolved upon the late Emperor's youthful\r\nnephew, Francis Joseph I., whose phenomenally prolonged reign has\r\ncontinued to the present day. Under the guidance of Schwarzenberg, who\r\nnow became the dominating figure in Austrian politics, the Hungarian\r\nMarch Laws were abrogated and preparations were set on foot to reduce\r\nHungary, as other portions of the Imperial dominions had been reduced,\r\nby force of arms. Pronouncing Francis Joseph a usurper, the Magyars\r\nrose _en masse_ in defense of their constitution and of the deposed\r\nFerdinand. In the conflict which ensued they were compelled to fight\r\nnot only the Austrians but also their rebellious Roumanian, Croatian,\r\nand Slavonian subjects, and their chances of success were from the\r\noutset slender. In a moment of exultation, April 14, 1849, the Diet at\r\nBudapest went so far as to declare Hungary an independent nation and\r\nto elect Kossuth to the presidency of a supposititious republic. The\r\nonly effect, however, was to impart to the contest an international\r\ncharacter. Upon appeal from Francis Joseph, Tsar Nicholas I.\r\nintervened in behalf of the \"legitimate\" Austrian power; whereupon the\r\nHungarians, seeking in vain for allies, were overcome by the weight of\r\nthe odds against them, and by the middle of August, 1849, the war was\r\nended.\r\n\r\n*504. Restoration of Autocracy.*--In Austria and Hungary alike the\r\nreaction was complete. In the Empire there had been promulgated, March\r\n4, 1849, a revised constitution; but at no time had it been intended\r\nby the sovereign or by those who surrounded him that constitutionalism\r\nshould be established upon a permanent basis, and during 1850-1851 one\r\nstep after another was taken in the direction of the revival of\r\nautocracy. December 31, 1851, \"in the name of the unity of the Empire\r\nand of monarchical principles,\" the constitution was revoked by\r\nImperial patent. At a stroke all of the peoples of the Empire were\r\ndeprived of their representative rights. Yet so incompletely had the\r\nliberal régime struck root that its passing occasioned scarcely a\r\nmurmur. Except that the abolition of feudal obligations was permanent,\r\nthe Empire settled back into a status which was almost precisely that\r\nof the age of Metternich. Vienna became once more the seat of a\r\ngovernment whose fundamental objects may be summarized as (1) to\r\nGermanize the Magyars and Slavs, (2) to restrain all agitation in\r\nbehalf of constitutionalism; and (3) to prevent freedom of thought and\r\nthe establishment of a free press. Hungary, by reason of her       (p. 456)\r\nrebellion, was considered to have forfeited utterly the fundamental\r\nrights which for centuries had been more or less grudgingly conceded\r\nher. She not only lost every vestige of her constitutional system, her\r\ndiet, her county assemblies, her local self-government; large\r\nterritories were stripped from her, and she was herself cut into five\r\ndistricts, each to be administered separately, largely by German\r\nofficials from Vienna. So far as possible, all traces of her historic\r\nnationality were obliterated.[653]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 653: Brief accounts of the revolution of\r\n                   1848-1849 in Austria-Hungary will be found in\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chaps. 6-7\r\n                   (bibliography, pp. 887-893), and Lavisse et\r\n                   Rambaud, Histoire Générale, XI., Chap. 4.

THE REVIVAL OF CONSTITUTIONALISM: THE AUSGLEICH\r\n\r\n*505. Constitutional Experiments, 1860-1861.*--The decade 1850-1860 was\r\nin Austria-Hungary a period of political and intellectual torpor.\r\nEmbarrassed by fiscal difficulties and by international complications,\r\nthe Government at Vienna struggled with desperation to maintain the\r\n_status quo_ as against the numerous forces that would have overthrown\r\nit. For a time the effort was successful, but toward the close of the\r\ndecade a swift decline of Imperial prestige compelled the adoption of\r\na more conciliatory policy. The Crimean War cost the Empire both\r\nallies and friends, and the disasters of the Italian campaigns of 1859\r\nadded to the seriousness of the Imperial position. By 1860 both the\r\nEmperor and his principal minister, Goluchowski, were prepared to\r\nundertake in all sincerity a reformation of the illiberal and\r\nunpopular governmental system. To this end the Emperor called\r\ntogether, March 5, 1860, representatives of the various provinces and\r\ninstructed them, in conjunction with the Reichsrath, or Imperial\r\nCouncil, to take under consideration plans for the reorganization of\r\nthe Empire. The majority of this \"reinforced Reichsrath\" recommended\r\nthe establishment permanently of a broadly national Reichsrath, or\r\nImperial assembly, together with the reconstitution of the old\r\nprovincial diets. The upshot was the promulgation, October 20, 1860,\r\nof a \"permanent and irrevocable\" diploma in which the Emperor made\r\nknown his intention thereafter to share all powers of legislation and\r\nfinance with the diets of the various portions of the Empire, and  (p. 457)\r\nwith a central Reichsrath at Vienna, the latter to be made up of\r\nmembers chosen by the Emperor from triple lists of nominees presented\r\nby the provincial diets.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary this programme was received with favor by the conservative\r\nmagnates, but the Liberals, led by Deák, refused absolutely to approve\r\nit, save on the condition that the constitutional régime of the\r\nkingdom, abrogated in 1849, should be regarded as completely restored.\r\nAt Vienna there had been no intention that the proposed innovation\r\nshould entail such consequences, and within four months of its\r\npromulgation the diploma of 1860 was superseded by a patent of\r\nFebruary 26, 1861, whereby the terms demanded by the Deák party were\r\nspecifically denied. In this patent--the handiwork principally of\r\nAnton von Schmerling, Goluchowski's successor in the office of\r\nMinister of the Interior--was elaborated further the plan of the new\r\nReichsrath. Two chambers there were to be--an upper, or House of\r\nLords, to be made up of members appointed by the Emperor in\r\nconsideration of birth, station, or merits and a lower, or House of\r\nRepresentatives, to consist of 343 members (Hungary sending 85 and\r\nBohemia 54), to be chosen by the provincial diets from their own\r\nmembership. Sessions of the body were to be annual. The new instrument\r\ndiffered fundamentally from the old, not simply in that it substituted\r\na bicameral for a unicameral parliamentary body, but also in that it\r\ndiverted from the local diets to the Reichsrath a wide range of\r\npowers, being designed, indeed, specifically to facilitate the\r\ncentralization of governmental authority.\r\n\r\n*506. The Hungarian Opposition.*--By reason chiefly of the refusal of\r\nthe Deák party to accept for Hungary anything short of the autonomy\r\nwhich had been enjoyed prior to 1849, the new scheme of government was\r\nfor a time only partially successful. In one after another of the\r\ncomponent parts of the Empire the provincial diets were called back to\r\nlife, and the Reichsrath itself was started upon its career. But the\r\nHungarians held aloof. The position which they assumed was that\r\nHungary had always been a separate nation; that the union with Austria\r\nlay only through the person of the monarch, who, indeed, in Hungary\r\nwas king only after he should have sworn to uphold the ancient laws of\r\nHungary and should have been crowned in Hungary with the iron crown of\r\nSt. Stephen; that no change in these ancient laws and practices could\r\nlegally be effected by the emperor-king alone; that the constitution\r\nof 1861 was inadequate, not only because it had been \"granted\" and\r\nmight as easily be revoked, but because it covered both Austria and\r\nHungary; reduced Hungary to the position of a mere province, and was\r\nnot at all identical with the Hungarian fundamental law abrogated in\r\n1849. April 6, 1861, the Hungarian Diet was assembled for the first\r\ntime since the termination of the revolution of 1848, and the      (p. 458)\r\npatent of the preceding February 26 was laid forthwith before it.\r\nAfter four months of heated debate the body refused definitely to\r\naccept the instrument and, on the contrary, adopted unanimously an\r\naddress drawn up by Deák calling upon the Vienna authorities to\r\nrestore the political and territorial integrity of the Hungarian\r\nkingdom. The sovereign's reply was a dissolution of the Diet, August\r\n21, and a levy of taxes by military execution. Hungary, in turn,\r\nrefused to be represented in the Reichsrath, or in any way to\r\nrecognize the new order.\r\n\r\n*507. Influences toward Conciliation.*--Through four years the deadlock\r\ncontinued. During the period Hungary, regarded by the authorities at\r\nVienna as having forfeited the last vestige of right to her ancient\r\nconstitution, was kept perpetually in a stage of siege. As time went\r\nby, however, it was made increasingly apparent that the surrender by\r\nwhich concord might be restored would have to be made in the main by\r\nAustria, and at last the Emperor was brought to a point where he was\r\nwilling, by an effectual recognition of Hungarian nationality, to\r\nsupply the indispensable condition of reconciliation. In June, 1865,\r\nthe sovereign paid a visit to the Hungarian capital, where he was\r\nreceived with unexpected enthusiasm, and September 20 the patent of\r\n1861, which the Hungarians had refused to allow to be put into\r\nexecution, was suspended. For the moment the whole of the Hapsburg\r\ndominion reverted to a state of absolutism; but negotiations were set\r\non foot looking toward a revival of constitutionalism under such\r\nconditions that the demands of the Hungarians might be brought into\r\nharmony with the larger interests of the Empire. Proceedings were\r\ninterrupted, in 1866, by the Austro-Prussian war, but in 1867 they\r\nwere pushed to a conclusion. In anticipation of the international\r\noutbreak which came in June, 1866, Deák had reworked a programme of\r\nconciliation drawn up in the spring of 1865, holding it in readiness\r\nto be employed as a basis of negotiation in the event of an Austrian\r\ntriumph, as an ultimatum in the event of an Austrian defeat. The\r\nAustrians, as it proved, were defeated swiftly and decisively, and by\r\nthis development the Hungarians, as Deák had hoped would be the case,\r\nwere given an enormously advantageous position. Humiliated by her\r\nexpulsion from a confederation which she had been accustomed to\r\ndominate, Austria, after the Peace of Prague (August 20, 1866), was no\r\nlonger in a position to defy the wishes of her disaffected sister\r\nstate. On the contrary, the necessity of the consolidation of her\r\nresources was never more apparent.\r\n\r\n*508. The Compromise Effected, 1867.*--July 3 occurred the disaster at\r\nSadowa. July 15 the Emperor summoned Deák to Vienna and put to     (p. 459)\r\nhim directly the question, What does Hungary want? Two days later he\r\naccorded provisional assent to the fundamentals of the Deák _projet_\r\nand designated as premier of the first parliamentary ministry of\r\nHungary Count Julius Andrássy. The working out of the precise\r\nsettlement between the two states fell principally to two men--Deák,\r\nrepresenting the Hungarian Liberals, and Baron Beust, formerly chief\r\nminister of the king of Saxony but in 1866 brought to Vienna and made\r\nAustrian chancellor and minister-president. After prolonged\r\nnegotiation a _projet_, differing from the original one of Deák in few\r\nrespects save that the unity of the monarchy was more carefully\r\nsafeguarded, was made ready to be acted upon by the parliaments of the\r\ntwo states. February 17, 1867, the Andrássy ministry was formed at\r\nBudapest and May 29, by a vote of 209 to 89, the terms of the\r\nAusgleich, or Compromise, were given formal approval by the Diet. At\r\nVienna the Reichsrath would probably have been disposed to reject the\r\nproposed arrangement but for the fact that Beust held out as an\r\ninducement the re-establishment of constitutionalism in Austria. The\r\nupshot was that the Reichsrath added some features by which the\r\n_projet_ was liberalized still further and made provision at the same\r\ntime for the revision and rehabilitation of the Imperial patent of\r\n1861. During the summer two deputations of fifteen members each,\r\nrepresenting the respective parliaments, drew up a plan of financial\r\nadjustment between the two states; and by acts of December 21-24 final\r\napproval was accorded on both sides to the whole body of agreements.\r\nAlready, June 8, in the great cathedral at Buda, Francis Joseph had\r\nbeen crowned Apostolic King of Hungary and the royal succession under\r\nthe terms of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, after eighteen years of\r\nsuspension, had been definitely resumed.[654]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 654: On Austro-Hungarian affairs in the\r\n                   period 1860-1867 see Cambridge Modern History, XI.,\r\n                   Chap. 15, XII., Chap. 7 (bibliography, pp.\r\n                   876-882), and Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire\r\n                   Générale, XI., Chap. 13.

THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n*509. Texts.*--The fundamental law of the Austrian Empire,[655] in so\r\nfar as it has been reduced to writing, exists in the form of a series\r\nof diplomas, patents, and statutes covering, in all, a period of some\r\ntwo hundred years. Of these instruments the most important are: (1)\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction of the Emperor Charles VI., promulgated\r\noriginally April 19, 1713, and in final form in 1724, by which is\r\nregulated the succession to the throne; (2) the Pragmatic Patent of\r\nthe Emperor Francis II., August 1, 1804, in accordance with which the\r\nsovereign bears in Austria the Imperial title; (3) the diploma of the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph I., October 20, 1860, by which was introduced\r\nin the Empire the principle of constitutional government; (4) the\r\npatent of Francis Joseph, February 26, 1861, by which was regulated in\r\ndetail the nature of this government; and (5) a series of five\r\nfundamental laws (_Staatsgrundgesetze_), all bearing the date December\r\n21, 1867, and comprising a thoroughgoing revision and extension of the\r\npatent of 1861. In a narrower sense, indeed, the constitution may be\r\nsaid to consist of these five documents, all of which were sanctioned\r\nby the crown as a portion of the same general settlement by which the\r\narrangements comprehended in the Ausgleich were effected. Of them,\r\none, in twenty articles, is essentially a bill of rights; a second, in\r\ntwenty-four sections, is concerned with Imperial representation; a\r\nthird, in six articles, provides for the establishment of the\r\nReichsgericht, or Imperial court; a fourth, in fifteen articles,\r\ncovers the subject of the judiciary; and the fifth, in twelve\r\narticles, deals with the exercise of administrative and executive\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 655: It should be emphasized that the\r\n                   phrase \"Austrian Empire,\" properly used, denotes\r\n                   Austria alone. Hungary is no part of the Empire.\r\n                   Throughout the following description effort has\r\n                   been made to avoid inaccuracy of expression by\r\n                   referring to Austria-Hungary as the \"dual\r\n                   monarchy,\" or simply as \"the monarchy.\" The\r\n                   nomenclature of the Austro-Hungarian union is\r\n                   cumbersome, but therein it merely reflects the\r\n                   character of the union itself.]\r\n\r\n*510. The Style of Government.*--Under the provisions of these\r\ninstruments Austria is constituted a limited monarchy, with a responsible\r\nministry, a bicameral legislative body, and a considerable         (p. 461)\r\nmeasure of local self-government. For the exercise, upon occasion, of\r\nessentially autocratic power, however, the way was left open through\r\nthe famous Section 13 of the patent of 1861, become Section 14 of the\r\nLaw concerning Imperial Representation of 1867. Around no portion of\r\nthe constitution has controversy raged more fiercely during the past\r\ngeneration. The article reads: \"If urgent circumstances should render\r\nnecessary some measure constitutionally requiring the consent of the\r\nReichsrath, when that body is not in session, such measure may be\r\ntaken by Imperial ordinance, issued under the collective\r\nresponsibility of the ministry, provided it makes no alteration of the\r\nfundamental law, imposes no lasting burden upon the public treasury,\r\nand alienates none of the domain of the state. Such ordinances shall\r\nhave provisionally the force of law, if they are signed by all of the\r\nministers, and shall be published with an express reference to this\r\nprovision of the fundamental law. The legal force of such an ordinance\r\nshall cease if the Government neglects to present it for the approval\r\nof the Reichsrath at its next succeeding session, and indeed first to\r\nthe House of Representatives, within four weeks of its convention, or\r\nif one of the houses refuses its approval thereto.\"[656] The prolonged\r\nexercise of autocratic power might seem here to be sufficiently\r\nguarded against, but in point of fact, as was demonstrated by the\r\nhistory of the notable parliamentary deadlock of 1897--1904[657], the\r\ngovernment can be, and has been, made to run year after year upon\r\nvirtually the sole basis of the article mentioned. It is only fair to\r\nadd, however, that, but for some such practical resource at the\r\ndisposal of the executive, constitutional government might long since\r\nhave been broken down completely by the recurrent obstructive tactics\r\nof the warring nationalities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 656: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 81.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 657: See p. 479.]\r\n\r\n*511. Amendment.*--The constitution promulgated March 4, 1849, made\r\nprovision for a definite process of amendment. Upon declaration by the\r\nlegislative power that any particular portion of the fundamental law\r\nstood in need of revision, the chambers were to be dissolved and newly\r\nelected ones were to take under consideration the proposed amendment,\r\nadopting it if a two-thirds majority could be obtained in each house.\r\nUpon all such proposals the veto of the Emperor, however, was\r\nabsolute. Neither the diploma of October 20, 1860, nor the patent of\r\nFebruary 26, 1861, contained any stipulation upon the subject, nor did\r\nany one of the fundamental laws of 1867 as originally adopted. By act\r\nof April 2, 1873, however, passed at the time when the lower house (p. 462)\r\nof the Reichsrath was being converted into an assembly directly\r\nrepresentative of the people, the Law concerning Imperial Representation\r\nwas so modified as to be made to include a specific stipulation with\r\nrespect to constitutional amendment in general. Under the terms of\r\nthis enactment all portions of the written constitution are subject to\r\namendment at the hand of the Reichsrath. As in European countries\r\ngenerally, no essential differentiation of powers that are constituent\r\nfrom those that are legislative is attempted. The process of revision\r\nis made even easier than that prescribed by the ill-fated instrument\r\nof 1849. It differs in no respect from that of ordinary legislation\r\nsave that proposed amendments require a two-thirds vote in each of the\r\nchambers instead of a simple majority. Since 1873 there have been\r\nadopted several amendments, of which the most notable were those of\r\n1896 and 1907 relative to the election of representatives.\r\n\r\n*512. The Rights of Citizens.*--For all natives of the various kingdoms\r\nand countries represented in the Reichsrath there exists a common\r\nright of Austrian citizenship. The complicated conditions under which\r\ncitizenship may be obtained, exercised, and forfeited are prescribed\r\nin legislative enactments of various dates. One of the five\r\nfundamental laws of 1867, however, covers at some length the general\r\nrights of citizens, and certain of its provisions are worthy of\r\nmention.[658] All citizens, it is declared, are equal before the law.\r\nPublic office is open equally to all. Freedom of passage of persons\r\nand property, within the territory of the state, is absolutely\r\nguaranteed, as is both liberty of person and inviolability of\r\nproperty. Every one is declared free to choose his occupation and to\r\nprepare himself for it in such place and manner as he may desire. The\r\nright of petition is recognized; likewise, under legal regulation,\r\nthat of assemblage and of the formation of associations. Freedom of\r\nspeech and of the press, under legal regulation, and liberty of\r\nreligion and of conscience are guaranteed to all. Science and its\r\nteaching is declared free. One has but to recall the repression of\r\nindividual liberty and initiative by which the era of Metternich was\r\ncharacterized to understand why, with the liberalizing of the Austrian\r\nstate under the constitution of 1867, it should have been deemed\r\nessential to put into the fundamental law these and similar guarantees\r\nof personal right and privilege.[659]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 658: Law concerning the General Rights of\r\n                   Citizens.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY                                     (p. 463)\r\n\r\n*513. The Emperor's Status.*--The sovereign authority of the Empire is\r\nvested in the Emperor. Duties are assigned to the ministers, and\r\nprivileges are granted to the legislative bodies; but all powers not\r\nexpressly conferred elsewhere remain with the Emperor as supreme head\r\nof the state. The Imperial office is hereditary in the male line of\r\nthe house of Hapsburg-Lothringen, and the rules governing the\r\nsuccession are substantially those which were laid down originally in\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction of 1713[660] promulgated by the Emperor Charles\r\nVI. to render possible the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa.\r\nFemales may inherit, but only in the event of the failure of male\r\nheirs. By the abdication of the direct heir, the throne may pass to a\r\nmember of the royal family who stands farther removed, as it did in\r\n1848 when the present Emperor was established on the throne while his\r\nfather was yet living. By reason of the unusual prolongation of the\r\nreign of Francis Joseph, there has been no opportunity in sixty years\r\nto put to a test the rules by which the inheritance is regulated.\r\nSince the death of the Crown Prince Rudolph the heir-presumptive has\r\nbeen the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, son of the Archduke Charles\r\nLouis, and nephew of the ruling Emperor. It is required that the\r\nsovereign be a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 660: Issued definitely in 1724.]\r\n\r\n*514. His Powers.*--By fundamental law it is declared that the Emperor\r\nis \"sacred, inviolable, and irresponsible.\" His powers of government\r\nare exercised largely, however, through ministers who are at least\r\nnominally responsible to the Reichsrath, and through officers and\r\nagents subordinate to them. Most important among the powers expressly\r\nconferred upon the Emperor, and indirectly exercised by him, are: (1)\r\nthe appointment and dismissal of ministers; (2) the naming of all\r\npublic officials whose appointment is not otherwise by law provided\r\nfor; (3) supreme command of the armed forces, with the power of    (p. 464)\r\ndeclaring war and concluding peace; (4) the conferring of titles,\r\norders, and other public distinctions, including the appointment of\r\nlife peers; (5) the granting of pardons and of amnesty; (6) the\r\nsummoning, adjourning, and dissolving of the various legislative\r\nbodies; (7) the issuing of ordinances with the provisional force of\r\nlaw, and (8) the concluding of treaties, with the limitation that the\r\nconsent of the Reichsrath is essential to the validity of treaties of\r\ncommerce and political treaties which impose obligations upon the\r\nEmpire, upon any part thereof, or upon any of its citizens. Further\r\nthan this, the right to coin money is exercised under the authority of\r\nthe Emperor; and the laws are promulgated, and all judicial power is\r\nexercised, in his name. Before assuming the throne, the Emperor is\r\nrequired to take a solemn oath in the presence of the two houses of\r\nthe Reichsrath \"to maintain inviolable the fundamental laws of the\r\nkingdoms and countries represented in the Reichsrath, and to govern in\r\nconformity with them, and in conformity with the laws in\r\ngeneral.\"[661] The present Emperor-King has a civil list of 22,600,000\r\ncrowns, half of which is derived from the revenues of Austria and half\r\nfrom those of Hungary. The Imperial residence in Vienna, the Hofburg,\r\nhas been the seat of the princes of Austria since the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 661: Law concerning the Exercise of\r\n                   Administrative and Executive Power, December 21,\r\n                   1867, § 8. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 88.]\r\n\r\n*515. The Ministers: Responsibility.*--The Austrian ministry comprises\r\nportfolios as follows: Finance, the Interior, Railways, National\r\nDefense, Agriculture, Justice, Commerce, Labor, and Instruction and\r\nWorship. Three important departments--those of War, Finance, and\r\nForeign Affairs and the Imperial and Royal House--are maintained by\r\nthe affiliated monarchies in common.[662] And there are usually from\r\none to four ministerial representatives of leading racial elements\r\nwithout portfolio, there being in the present cabinet one such\r\nminister for Galicia. All ministers are appointed and dismissed by the\r\nEmperor. Under the leadership of a president of the council or premier\r\n(without portfolio), they serve as the Emperor's councillors, execute\r\nhis will, and administer the affairs of their respective branches of\r\nthe public service. It is provided by fundamental law that they shall\r\nbe responsible for the constitutionality and legality of governmental\r\nacts performed within the sphere of their powers.[663] They are\r\nresponsible to the two branches of the national parliament alike, and\r\nmay be interpellated or impeached by either. For impeachment an    (p. 465)\r\nelaborate procedure is prescribed, though thus far it has not proved\r\nof practical utility. Every law promulgated in the Emperor's name must\r\nbear the signature of a responsible minister, and several sorts of\r\nordinances--such as those proclaiming a state of siege or suspending\r\nthe constitutional rights of a citizen--require the concurrent\r\nsignature of the entire ministry. Every minister possesses the right\r\nto sit and to speak in either chamber of the Reichsrath, where the\r\npolicy of the Government may call for explanation or defense, and\r\nwhere there are at least occasional interpellations to be answered.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 662: There is a joint ministry of\r\n                   finance, though each of the monarchies maintains a\r\n                   separate ministry for the administration of its own\r\n                   fiscal affairs. On the joint ministries see p.\r\n                   510.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 663: Law concerning the Exercise of\r\n                   Administrative and Executive Power, December 21,\r\n                   1867, § 9. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 88-89.]\r\n\r\nNominally, the parliamentary system is in vogue, but at best it\r\noperates only indifferently. Supposedly responsible, collectively and\r\nindividually, to the Reichsrath, the ministers are in practice far\r\nmore dependent upon the Emperor than upon the chambers. In France the\r\ninability of political parties to coalesce into two great opposing\r\ngroups largely defeats the best ends of the parliamentary system. In\r\nAustria the numerous and ineradicable racial divisions deflect the\r\nsystem further still from the lines upon which theoretically it should\r\noperate. No political group is sufficiently powerful to rule alone,\r\nand no working affiliation can long be made to subsist. The\r\nconsequence is, not only that the Government can ordinarily play off\r\none faction against another and secure pretty much its own way, but\r\nalso that the responsibility of the ministers to the chambers is much\r\nless effective in practice than on paper it appears to be.[664]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 664: W. Beaumont, Cabinets éphémères et\r\n                   ministères provisoires en Autriche, in _Annales des\r\n                   Sciences Politiques_, March, 1900; H. Hantich,\r\n                   Nouvelle phase du parlementarisme en Autriche, in\r\n                   _Questions Diplomatiques et Coloniales_, February\r\n                   1, 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE REICHSRATH--THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n*516. The House of Lords.*--The Reichsrath consists of two chambers. The\r\nupper is known as the Herrenhaus, or House of Lords; the lower, as the\r\nAbgeordnetenhaus, or House of Representatives. The Herrenhaus consists\r\nof a somewhat variable number of men who sit in part by _ex-officio_\r\nright, in part by hereditary station, and in part by special Imperial\r\nappointment. At the close of 1910 there were in the chamber 266\r\nmembers, distributed as follows: (1) princes of the Imperial family\r\nwho are of age, 15; (2) nobles of high rank qualified by the\r\npossession of large estates and nominated to an hereditary seat by the\r\nEmperor, 74; (3) ecclesiastics--10 archbishops and 8 bishops--who are\r\nof princely title inherent in their episcopal seats, 18; and (4) persons\r\nnominated by the Emperor for life in recognition of special service\r\nrendered to the state or the Church, or unusual distinction        (p. 466)\r\nattained in literature, art, or science, 159. By law of January 26,\r\n1907, the number of members in the last-mentioned group may not exceed\r\n170, nor be less than 150.[665] Within these limits, the power of the\r\nEmperor to create life peers is absolute. The prerogative is one which\r\nhas several times been exercised to facilitate the enactment of\r\nmeasures upon whose adoption the Government was determined. The\r\npresident and vice-president of the chamber are appointed from its\r\nmembers by the Emperor at the beginning of each session; but the body\r\nchooses all of its remaining officers. The privileges and powers of\r\nthe Herrenhaus are co-ordinate with those of the Abgeordnetenhaus,\r\nsave that money bills and bills fixing the number of military recruits\r\nmust be presented first in the lower chamber.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 665: It is interesting to observe that\r\n                   this guarantee against the wholesale creation of\r\n                   peers was brought forward with the object of\r\n                   winning for the Government's Universal Suffrage\r\n                   Bill the assent of the upper chamber.]\r\n\r\n*517. The House of Representatives: Composition.*--The lower chamber, as\r\nconstituted by fundamental law of 1867, was made up of 203\r\nrepresentatives, apportioned among the several provinces and elected\r\nby the provincial diets. The system worked poorly, and a law of 1868\r\nauthorized the voters of a province to elect the stipulated quota of\r\nrepresentatives in the event that the Diet failed to do so. Still\r\nthere was difficulty, arising largely from the racial rivalries in the\r\nprovinces, and by an amendment of April 2, 1873, the right of election\r\nwas vested exclusively in the enfranchised inhabitants of the Empire.\r\nThe number of members was at the same time increased to 353, though\r\nwithout modifying the proportion of representatives of the various\r\nprovinces. Further amendment, in 1896, brought up the membership to\r\n425, where it remained until 1907, when it was raised to the present\r\nfigure, 516.\r\n\r\n*518. Early Electoral Arrangements: Law of 1873.*--The broadly\r\ndemocratic electoral system which prevails in the Austrian dominions\r\nto-day is a very recent creation. With the introduction of\r\nconstitutionalism in 1867 the problem of the franchise became one of\r\npeculiar and increasing difficulty, and the process by which the\r\nEmpire has been brought laboriously to its present condition of\r\ndemocracy has constituted one of the most tortuous chapters in recent\r\npolitical history. The conditions by which from the outset the problem\r\nwas complicated were three in number: first, the large survival of\r\nself-assertiveness on the part of the various provinces among whom\r\nparliamentary representatives were to be distributed; second, the\r\nkeenness of the ambitions of the several racial elements for parliamentary\r\npower; and third, the utter lack of experience and of traditions   (p. 467)\r\non the part of the Austrian peoples in the matter of democratic\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1873, the right of electing deputies was withdrawn from the\r\nprovincial diets it was conferred, without the establishment of a new\r\nelectorate, upon those elements of the provincial populations which\r\nhad been accustomed to take part in the election of the local diets.\r\nThese were four in number: (1) the great landowners, comprising those\r\nwho paid a certain land tax, varying in the several provinces from 50\r\nto 250 florins ($20 to $100), and including women and corporations;\r\n(2) the cities, in which the franchise was extended to all males of\r\ntwenty-four who paid a direct tax of ten gulden annually; (3) chambers\r\nof commerce and of industry; and (4) rural communes, in which the\r\nqualifications for voting were the same as in the cities. To each of\r\nthese curiæ, or classes, the law of 1873 assigned a number of\r\nparliamentary representatives, to be elected thereafter in each\r\nprovince directly by the voters of the respective classes, rather than\r\nindirectly through the diets. The number of voters in each class and\r\nthe relative importance of the individual voter varied enormously. In\r\n1890, in the class of landowners there was one deputy to every 63\r\nvoters; in the chambers of commerce, one to every 27; in the cities,\r\none to every 2,918; and in the rural districts, one to every\r\n11,600.[666]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 666: Hazen, Europe since 1815, 399.]\r\n\r\n*519. The Taaffe Electoral Bill of 1893.*--During the period covered by\r\nthe ministry of Count Taaffe (February, 1879, to October, 1893) there\r\nwas growing demand, especially on the part of the Socialists, Young\r\nCzechs, German Nationalists, and other radical groups, for a new\r\nelectoral law, and during the years 1893-1896 this issue quite\r\novershadowed all others. In October, 1893, Taaffe brought forward a\r\nsweeping electoral measure which, if it had become law, would have\r\ntransferred the bulk of political power to the working classes, at the\r\nsame time reducing to impotence the preponderant German Liberal party.\r\nThe measure did not provide for the general, equal, and direct\r\nsuffrage for which the radicals were clamoring, and by which the\r\nnumber of voters would have been increased from 1,700,000 to\r\n5,500,000. But it did contemplate the increase of the electorate to\r\nsomething like 4,000,000. This it proposed to accomplish by abolishing\r\nall property qualifications of voters in the cities and rural\r\ncommunes[667] and by extending the voting privilege to all adult males\r\nwho were able to read and write and who had resided in their electoral\r\ndistrict a minimum of six months. To avoid the danger of an excess of\r\ndemocracy Taaffe planned to retain intact the curiæ of landed\r\nproprietors and chambers of commerce, so that it would still be    (p. 468)\r\ntrue that 5,402 large landholders would be represented in the lower\r\nhouse by 85 deputies, the chambers of commerce by 22, and the\r\nremainder of the nation--some 24,000,000 people--by 246. Impelled\r\nespecially by fear of socialism, the Conservatives, the Poles, the\r\nGerman Liberals, and other elements opposed the project, and there\r\nnever was any real chance of its adoption. By reason of its halfway\r\ncharacter the Socialists, in congress at Vienna in March, 1894,\r\ncondemned it as \"an insult to the working classes.\" Even in Hungary\r\n(which country, of course, the measure did not immediately concern)\r\nthere was apprehension, the ruling Magyars fearing that the adoption\r\nof even a partial universal suffrage system in the affiliated state\r\nwould prompt a demand on the part of the numerically preponderant\r\nSlavic populations of Hungary for the same sort, of thing.\r\nAnticipating defeat, Taaffe resigned, in October, 1893, before the\r\nmeasure came to a vote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 667: By a law of 1882 the direct-tax\r\n                   qualification had been reduced to 5 florins.]\r\n\r\n*520. The Electoral Law of 1896.*--Under the Windischgrätz and\r\nKielmansegg ministries which succeeded no progress was realized, but\r\nthe cabinet of the Polish Count Badeni, constituted October 4, 1895,\r\nmade electoral reform the principal item in its programme and\r\nsucceeded in carrying through a measure which, indeed, was but a\r\ncaricature of Taaffe's project, but which none the less marked a\r\ndistinct stage of progress toward the broad-based franchise for which\r\nthe radicals were clamoring. The Government's bill was laid before the\r\nReichsrath, February 16, 1896, and was adopted unchanged within the\r\nspace of two weeks. The general suffrage which the Socialists demanded\r\nwas established, for the election, however, not of the 353\r\nrepresentatives already composing the lower chamber, but merely of a\r\nbody of 72 new representatives to be added to the present membership.\r\nIn the choice of these 72 additional members every male citizen\r\ntwenty-four years of age who had resided in a given district as much\r\nas six months prior to an election was to be entitled to participate;\r\nbut elections were to be direct only in those districts in which\r\nindirect voting had been abolished by provincial legislation. Votes\r\nwere to be cast, as a rule, by ballot, though under some circumstances\r\norally. All pre-existing classes of voters were left unchanged, and to\r\nthem was simply added a fifth. The aggregate number of electors in the\r\nEmpire was raised to 5,333,000. Of the number, however, the 1,732,000\r\ncomprised in the original four curiæ were still to elect 353 of the\r\n425 members of the chamber, with the further inequity that many of the\r\npersons who profited by the new arrangement were included already in\r\none or another of the older classes, and hence were vested by it with\r\na plural vote. Although, therefore, the voting privilege was now   (p. 469)\r\nconferred upon millions of small taxpayers and non-taxpayers who never\r\nbefore had possessed it, the nation was still very far from a fair and\r\ndemocratic suffrage system.\r\n\r\n*521. Renewed Agitation: the Universal Suffrage Law of\r\n1907.*--Throughout the decade following 1896 electoral agitation was\r\ncontinuous and widespread, but not until 1905 did the situation become\r\nfavorable for further reform. In September of the year mentioned\r\nFrancis Joseph approved the proposal that universal suffrage be\r\nincluded in the programme of the Fejérváry cabinet in Hungary, and the\r\nact was taken at once to mean that the sovereign had arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the democratizing of the franchise was inevitable in\r\nall of his dominions. In point of fact, by reason of the prolonged\r\nparliamentary crisis of late years at Vienna, the Emperor was fast\r\narriving at precisely such a conclusion. Stimulated by current\r\ndevelopments in Hungary and in Russia, the Austrian Socialists, late\r\nin 1905, entered upon a notable series of demonstrations, and,\r\nNovember 28, Premier Gautsch was moved to pledge the Government to\r\nintroduce forthwith a franchise reform bill based upon the principle\r\nof universal suffrage. February 23, 1906, the promise was redeemed by\r\nthe presentation in the Reichsrath of proposals for (1) the abolition\r\nof the system of electoral curiæ, (2) the extension of an equal\r\nfranchise to all males over twenty-four years of age and resident in\r\ntheir district a year, (3) the division of Austria racially into\r\ncompartments so that each ethnic group might be protected against its\r\nrivals, and (4) the increase of the number of seats from 425 to 455, a\r\nfixed number to be allotted to each province, and in each province to\r\neach race, in accordance with numbers and taxpaying capacity.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the bill in which these proposals were incorporated\r\nwas at first not promising. The Social Democrats, the Christian\r\nSocialists, and the Young Czechs were favorable; the Poles were\r\nreserved in their attitude, but inclined to be hostile; practically\r\nall of the German Liberals were opposed; and the landed proprietors,\r\nlong accustomed to dominate within the preponderant German element in\r\nthe Reichsrath, were violently hostile. In April, 1906, while the bill\r\nwas pending, the Gautsch ministry found itself without a parliamentary\r\nmajority and was succeeded by a ministry made up by Prince\r\nHohenlohe-Schillingsfürst. This ministry lasted but six weeks, and\r\nJune 2 the coalition cabinet of Baron Beck assumed office. Convinced\r\nthat the establishment of universal and direct suffrage would afford\r\nthe best means of stimulating loyalty to the dynasty, as well as the\r\nonly practicable means of freeing the Government from parliamentary\r\nobstructionism, Emperor Francis Joseph accorded the Beck ministry his\r\nearnest support in its purpose to push to a conclusion the task of (p. 470)\r\nelectoral reform. The effort attained fruition in the memorable\r\nUniversal Suffrage Law passed by both houses of the Reichsrath in the\r\nclosing days of 1906 and approved by the Emperor January 26 of the\r\nfollowing year. The measure, which was in form an amendment of the\r\nfundamental law of December 21, 1867, concerning Imperial\r\nRepresentation, was opposed by the conservative and aristocratic\r\nmembers of both houses and by the extremer representatives of the\r\nvarious nationalities; but, like other portions of the constitutional\r\nsystem of the Empire, it may not be amended save by a two-thirds vote\r\nof both houses, and it is likely to endure through a considerable\r\nperiod unchanged.\r\n\r\n*522. Racial and Geographical Distribution of Seats.*--In the course of\r\nthe prolonged negotiations between the Government and representatives\r\nof the various nationalities by which the preparation of the law was\r\nattended there was worked out a fresh allotment of seats to the\r\nseveral racial groups of the Empire, in proportion, roughly, to\r\ntaxpaying capacity. The total number of seats was raised from 425 to\r\n516. Their distribution among the races, as compared with that\r\nformerly existing, was arranged as follows:[668]\r\n\r\n                                        _Before 1907_  _After 1907_\r\n  Germans of all parties                    205          233\r\n  Czechs                                     81          108\r\n  Poles                                      71           80\r\n  South Slavs (Slovenes, Croats, Serbs)      27           37\r\n  Ruthenes                                   11           34\r\n  Italians                                   18           19\r\n  Roumanians                                  5            5\r\n                                            ---          ---\r\n                                            418          516\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 668: For tables exhibiting comparatively\r\n                   the distribution of seats in 1867, 1873, 1896, and\r\n                   1907, see W. Beaumont, Le suffrage universel en\r\n                   Autriche: la loi du 26 janvier 1907 in _Annales des\r\n                   Sciences Politiques_, Sept., 1907.]\r\n\r\nThe striking feature of this readjustment is, of course, the increased\r\nnumber of seats assigned to the non-German nationalities. In\r\nproportion strictly to population, the Germans still possess a larger\r\nnumber of seats than that to which they are entitled. But the\r\naggregate is only 233, while the aggregate of Slavic seats is 259.\r\nEven if the former German-Italian _bloc_ were still effective it could\r\ncontrol a total of only 257 votes; but, in point of fact, the Italians\r\nin the Reichsrath to-day are apt to act with the Slavs rather than\r\nwith the Germans.\r\n\r\nAfter decision had been reached regarding the distribution of seats in\r\naccordance with races it remained to effect a distribution\r\ngeographically among the provinces of the Empire. To each of the\r\nseveral provinces was assigned an aggregate quota which, in turn,  (p. 471)\r\nwas distributed within the province among the racial groups represented\r\nin the provincial population. The allotment made, in comparison with\r\nthat prevailing under the law of 1896, was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                             _Before 1907_  _After 1907_\r\n  Kingdom of Bohemia                             110           130\r\n  Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, with\r\n    the grand-duchy of Cracow                     78           106\r\n  Archduchy of Lower Austria                      46            64\r\n  Margravate of Moravia                           43            49\r\n  Duchy of Styria                                 27            30\r\n  Princely County of Tyrol                        21            25\r\n  Archduchy of Upper Austria                      20            22\r\n  Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia                12            15\r\n  Duchy of Bukovina                               11            14\r\n  Duchy of Carniola                               11            12\r\n  Kingdom of Dalmatia                             11            11\r\n  Duchy of Carinthia                              10            10\r\n  Duchy of Salsburg                                6             7\r\n  Margravate of Istria                             5             6\r\n  Princely County of Görz and Gradisca             5             6\r\n  City of Trieste and its territory                5             5\r\n  Territory of Vorarlberg                          4             4\r\n                                                 ---           ---\r\n                                                 425           516\r\n\r\n*523. Electoral Qualifications and Procedure.*--By the law of 1907 the\r\nclass system of voting was abolished entirely in national elections,\r\nand in its stead was established general, equal, and direct manhood\r\nsuffrage. With insignificant exceptions, every male citizen who has\r\nattained the age of twenty-four, and who, at the time the election is\r\nordered, has resided during at least one year in the commune in which\r\nthe right to vote is to be exercised, is qualified to vote for a\r\nparliamentary representative. And any male thirty years of age, or\r\nover, who has been during at least three years a citizen, and who is\r\npossessed of the franchise, is eligible to be chosen as a\r\nrepresentative. Voting is by secret ballot, and an absolute majority\r\nof all votes cast is necessary for a choice. In default of such a\r\nmajority there is a second ballot between the two candidates who at\r\nthe first test received the largest number of votes. It is stipulated,\r\nfurther, that when so ordered by the provincial diet, voting shall be\r\nobligatory, under penalty of fine, and in the provinces of Lower\r\nAustria, Upper Austria, Silesia, Salsburg, Moravia, and Vorarlberg\r\nevery elector is required by provincial regulation to appear at every\r\nparliamentary election in his district, and to present his ballot, the\r\npenalty for neglect (unless explained to the satisfaction of the\r\nproper magistrate) being a fine ranging from one to fifty crowns. In\r\nthe House of Lords, where there was strong opposition to the       (p. 472)\r\nprinciple of manhood suffrage, effort was made to introduce in the act\r\nof 1907 a provision for the conferring of a second vote upon all\r\nvoters above the age of thirty-five. By the Emperor and ministry it\r\nwas urged, however, that the injection of such a modification would\r\nwreck the measure, and when the lower chamber tacitly pledged itself\r\nto enact a law designed to prevent the \"swamping\" of the peers by\r\nImperial appointment at the behest of a parliamentary majority, the\r\nplural voting project was abandoned.[669]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 669: As has been pointed out, the pledge\r\n                   was redeemed in 1907 by a measure fixing the\r\n                   minimum number of life peers at 150 and the maximum\r\n                   at 170. See p. 466.]\r\n\r\nSo far as practicable, the electoral constituencies in the various\r\nprovinces are arranged to preserve the distinction between urban and\r\nrural districts and to comprise racial groups that are essentially\r\nhomogeneous. In regions, as Bohemia, where the population is\r\nespecially mixed separate constituencies and registers are maintained\r\nfor the electors of each nationality, and a man may vote on only the\r\nregister of his own race and for a candidate of that race. Germans,\r\nthus, are obliged to vote for Germans, Czechs for Czechs, Poles for\r\nPoles; so that, while there may be a contest between a German Clerical\r\nand a German Liberal or between a Young Czech and a Radical Czech,\r\nthere can be none between Germans and Czechs, or between Poles and\r\nRuthenes. In general, each district returns but one representative.\r\nThe 36 Galician districts, however, return two apiece. Each elector\r\nthere, as elsewhere, votes for but one candidate, the device\r\npermitting the representation of minorities. The population comprising\r\na constituency varies from 26,693 in Salsburg to 68,724 in Galicia.\r\nThe average is 49,676.[670]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 670: On the electoral law of 1907 see W.\r\n                   Beaumont, Le suffrage universel en Autriche: la loi\r\n                   du 26 janvier 1907, in _Annales des Sciences\r\n                   Politiques_, Sept., 1907; H.

The Reichsrath: Sessions and Procedure.*--By the law of 1867 no\r\nlimit was fixed for the period of service of the parliamentary\r\nrepresentative. The life of the Reichsrath, and consequently the\r\ntenure of the individual deputy, was terminated only by a dissolution.\r\nUnder provision of an amendment of April 2, 1873, however, members of\r\nthe lower chamber are elected for a term of six years, at the\r\nexpiration of which period, as also in the event of a dissolution, a\r\nnew election must be held. Representatives are indefinitely eligible\r\nfor re-election. Vacancies are filled by special elections, which may\r\nbe held at any time, according to procedure specified by law.\r\nRepresentatives receive a stipend of 20 crowns for each day's\r\nattendance, with an allowance for travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental law prescribes that the Reichsrath shall be        (p. 473)\r\nconvened annually, \"during the winter months when possible.\"[671] The\r\nEmperor appoints the president and vice-president of the Herrenhaus,\r\nfrom among the members of the chamber, and for the period of a\r\nsession. The Abgeordnetenhaus elects from its members its president\r\nand vice-president. Normally, the sessions of both houses are public,\r\nthough upon request of the president, or of at least ten members, and\r\nby a decision taken behind closed doors, each house possesses the\r\nright, in exceptional instances, to exclude spectators. Projects of\r\nlegislation may be submitted by the Government or by the individual\r\nmembers of the chambers. Measures pass by majority vote; but no act is\r\nvalid unless at the time of its passage there are present in the lower\r\nhouse as many as 100 members, and in the upper house as many as 40. A\r\ncurious provision touching the relations of the two houses is that if,\r\non a question of appropriation or of the size of a military\r\ncontingent, no agreement can be reached between the two houses after\r\nprolonged deliberation, the smallest figure approved by either house\r\nshall be regarded as voted.[672] By decree of the Emperor the\r\nReichsrath may at any time be adjourned, or the lower chamber\r\ndissolved. Ministers and chiefs of the central administration are\r\nentitled to take part in all deliberations, and to present their\r\nproposals personally or through representatives. Each house may,\r\nindeed, require a minister's attendance. Members of the chambers may\r\nnot be held responsible for any vote cast; and for any utterances made\r\nby them they may be held responsible only by the house to which they\r\nbelong. Unless actually apprehended in a criminal act, no member of\r\neither house may be arrested or proceeded against judicially during\r\nthe continuance of a session, except by the consent of the chamber to\r\nwhich he belongs.[673]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 671: Law of December 21, 1867, concerning\r\n                   Imperial Representation, § 10.

(Vienna, 1909).]\r\n\r\n*525. The Reichsrath: Powers.*--The powers of the Reichsrath are, in\r\ngeneral, those ordinarily belonging to a parliamentary body. According\r\nto fundamental law of 1867, they comprise all matters which relate to\r\nthe rights, obligations, and interests of the provinces represented in\r\nthe chambers, in so far as these matters are not required to be\r\nhandled conjointly with the proper representatives of the Hungarian\r\nportion of the monarchy. The Reichsrath examines and ratifies or\r\nrejects commercial treaties, and likewise political treaties which\r\nplace a fiscal burden on the Empire or any portion of it, impose   (p. 474)\r\nobligations upon individual citizens, or involve any change of\r\nterritorial status. It makes provision for the military and naval\r\nestablishments. It enacts the budget and approves all taxes and\r\nduties. It regulates the monetary system, banking, trade, and\r\ncommunication. It legislates on citizenship, public health, individual\r\nrights, education, criminal justice and police regulation, the duties\r\nand interrelations of the provinces, and a wide variety of other\r\nthings. It exercises the right of legalizing or annulling Imperial\r\nordinances which, under urgent circumstances, may be promulgated by\r\nthe Emperor with the provisional force of law when the chambers are\r\nnot in session.[674] Such ordinances may not introduce any alteration\r\nin the fundamental law, impose any lasting burden upon the treasury,\r\nor alienate territory. They must be issued, if issued at all, under\r\nthe signature of all of the ministers, and they lose their legal force\r\nif the Government does not lay them before the lower chamber within\r\nthe first four weeks of its next ensuing session, or if either of the\r\ntwo houses refuses its assent thereto. Each of the houses may\r\ninterpellate the ministers upon all matters within the scope of their\r\npowers, may investigate the administrative acts of the Government,\r\ndemand information from the ministers concerning petitions presented\r\nto the houses, may appoint commissions, to which the ministers must\r\ngive all necessary information, and may give expression to its views\r\nin the form of addresses or resolutions. Any minister may be impeached\r\nby either house.[675]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 674: Issued under warrant of the\r\n                   much-controverted Section 14. See p. 461.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 675: Law of December 21, 1867, concerning\r\n                   Imperial Representation, § 21.

Racial Elements in the Empire.*--The key to the politics of\r\nAustria is afforded by the racial composition of the Empire's\r\npopulation. In our own day there is a tendency, in consequence of the\r\nspread of socialism and of other radical programmes which leap across\r\nracial and provincial lines, toward the rise of Austrian parties which\r\nshall be essentially inter-racial in their constituencies. Yet at the\r\nelections of 1907--the first held under the new electoral law--of the\r\ntwenty-six party affiliations which succeeded in obtaining at least\r\none parliamentary seat all save possibly two comprised either\r\nhomogeneous racial groups or factions of such groups. Fundamentally,\r\nthe racial question in Austria has always been that of German _versus_\r\nnon-German. The original Austria was preponderantly German; the\r\nwealthiest, the best educated, the most widespread of the racial   (p. 475)\r\nelements in the Empire to-day is the German; and by the Germans it has\r\nregularly been assumed that Austria is, and ought to be, essentially a\r\nGerman country.[676] In this assumption the non-German populations of\r\nthe Empire have at no time acquiesced; and while they have never been\r\nable to combine long or effectively against the dominating Germanic\r\nelement, they have sought persistently, each in its own way, to compel\r\na fuller recognition of their several interests and rights.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 676: Lowell, Governments and Parties,\r\n                   II., 95.]\r\n\r\nThe nationalities represented within the Empire fall broadly into\r\nthree great groups: the German, the Slavic, and the Latin. In an\r\naggregate population of 26,107,304 in 1900 the Germans numbered\r\n9,171,614, or somewhat more than 35 per cent; the Slavs, 15,690,000,\r\nor somewhat more than 60 per cent; and the Latins, 958,065, or\r\napproximately 3.7 per cent. The Germans, comprising the most numerous\r\nof the individual nationalities, occupy exclusively Upper Austria,\r\nSalsburg, and Vorarlberg, the larger portion of Lower Austria,\r\nnorth-western Carinthia, the north and center of Styria and Tyrol,\r\nand, in fact, are distributed much more generally over the entire\r\nEmpire than is any one of the other racial elements. The Slavs are in\r\ntwo principal groups, the northern and the southern. The northern\r\nincludes the Czechs and Slovaks, dwelling principally in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia, and numbering, in 1900, 5,955,397; the Poles, comprising a\r\ncompact mass of 4,252,483 people in Galicia and Silesia; and the\r\nRuthenes, numbering 3,381,570, in eastern Galicia and in Bukovina. The\r\nsouthern Slavic group includes the Slovenes, numbering 1,192,780, in\r\nCarniola, Görz, Gradisca, Istria, and Styria, and the Servians and\r\nCroats, numbering 711,380, in Istria and Dalmatia. The peoples of\r\nLatin stock are the Italians and Ladini (727,102), in Tyrol, Görz,\r\nGradisca, Dalmatia, and Trieste, and the Roumanians (230,963) in\r\nBukovina. Within many of the groups mentioned there is meager survival\r\nof political unity. There are German Clericals, German Progressives,\r\nGerman Radicals, German Agrarians; likewise Old Czechs, Young Czechs,\r\nCzech Realists, Czech Agrarians, Czech Clericals, and Czech Radicals.\r\nAustrian party history within the past fifty years comprises largely\r\nthe story of the political contests among the several nationalities,\r\nand of the disintegration of these nationalities into a bewildering\r\nthrong of clamorous party cliques.\r\n\r\n*527. Centralists and Federalists.*--The more important of the party\r\ngroups of to-day trace their origins to the formative period in recent\r\nAustro-Hungarian constitutional history, 1860-1867. During this period\r\nthe fundamental issue in the Empire was the degree of centralization\r\nwhich it was desirable, or possible, to achieve in the reshaping   (p. 476)\r\nof the governmental system. On the one hand were the centralists, who\r\nwould have bound the loosely agglomerated kingdoms, duchies, and\r\nterritories of the Empire into a consolidated state. On the other were\r\nthe federalists, to whom centralization appeared dangerous, as well as\r\nunjust to the Empire's component nationalities. Speaking broadly, the\r\nGermans, supported by the Italians, comprised the party of\r\ncentralization; the Slavs, that of federalism. The establishment of\r\nthe constitution of 1867, as well as of the Compromise with Hungary in\r\nthe same year, was the achievement of the centralists, and with the\r\ncompletion of this gigantic task there gradually took form a compactly\r\norganized political party, variously known as the National German\r\nparty, the German Liberals, or the Constitutionalists, whose\r\nwatchwords were the preservation of the constitution and the\r\nGermanization of the Empire. For a time this party maintained the\r\nupper hand completely, but its ascendancy was menaced not only by the\r\ndisaffected forces of federalism but by the continued tenseness of the\r\nclerical question and, after 1869, by intestine conflict. As was\r\nperhaps inevitable, the party split into two branches, the one radical\r\nand the other moderate. During the earlier months of 1870 the\r\nRadicals, under Hasner, were in control; but in their handling of the\r\nvexatious Polish and Bohemian questions they failed completely and,\r\nApril 4, they gave place to the Moderates under the premiership of the\r\nPolish Count Potocki. The new ministry sought to govern in a\r\nconciliatory spirit and with the support of all groups, but its\r\nsuccess was meager. February 7, 1871, a cabinet which was essentially\r\nfederalist was constituted under Count Hohenwart. Its decentralizing\r\npolicies, however, were of such a character that the racial question\r\ngave promise of being settled by the utter disintegration of the\r\nEmpire, and after eight months it was dismissed.\r\n\r\n*528. Rule of the German Liberals, 1871-1879.*--With a cabinet presided\r\nover by Prince Adolf Auersperg the German Liberals then returned to\r\npower. Their tenure was prolonged to 1879 and might have been\r\ncontinued beyond that date but for the recurrence of factional strife\r\nwithin their ranks. The period was one in which some of the\r\nobstructionist groups, notably the Czechs, fell into division among\r\nthemselves, so that the opposition which the Liberals were called upon\r\nto encounter was distinctly less effective than otherwise it might\r\nhave been. At no time since 1867 had the Czechs consented to be\r\nrepresented in the Reichsrath, a body, indeed, which they had\r\npersisted in refusing to recognize as a legitimately constituted\r\nparliament of the Empire. During the early seventies a party of Young\r\nCzechs sprang up which advocated an abandonment of passive         (p. 477)\r\nresistance and the substitution of parliamentary activity in behalf of\r\nthe interests of the race. The Old Czechs were unprepared for such a\r\nshift of policy, and in 1873 they played directly into the hands of\r\nthe Liberal government by refusing to participate in the consideration\r\nof the electoral reform by which the choice of representatives was\r\ntaken from the provincial diets and vested in the four classes of\r\nprovincial constituencies. For the carrying of this measure a\r\ntwo-thirds majority was required, and if the Czechs had been willing\r\nto vote at all upon it they might easily have compassed its defeat. As\r\nit was, the amendment was carried without difficulty. A tenure of\r\npower which not even the financial crisis of 1873 could break was,\r\nhowever, sacrificed through factional bickerings. Within both the\r\nministry and the Reichsrath, the dominant party broke into three\r\ngroups, and the upshot was the dissolution, February 6, 1879, of the\r\nministry and the creation of a new one under the presidency of Count\r\nTaaffe, long identified with the Moderate element. Three months later\r\nthe House of Representatives was dissolved. In the elections that\r\nfollowed the Liberals lost a total of forty-five seats, and therewith\r\ntheir position as the controlling party in both the Reichsrath and the\r\nnation. Taaffe retained the premiership, but his Liberal colleagues\r\nwere replaced by Czechs, Poles, Clericals, and representatives indeed\r\nof pretty nearly all of the existing groups save the Germans.[677]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 677: As at first reconstituted, the\r\n                   ministry contained a German Liberal, but he soon\r\n                   resigned.]\r\n\r\n*529. The Taaffe Ministry, 1879-1893.*--The prolonged ministry of Count\r\nTaaffe comprises the second period of Austrian parliamentary history.\r\nOf notably moderate temper, Taaffe had never been a party man of the\r\nusual sort, and he entered office with an honest purpose to administer\r\nthe affairs of the nation without regard to considerations of party or\r\nof race. The establishment of his reconstituted ministry was\r\nsignalized by the appearance of Czech deputies for the first time upon\r\nthe floor of the national parliament. The Taaffe government found its\r\nsupport in what came to be known as the Right--a quasi-coalition of\r\nPoles, Czechs, Clericals, and the Slavic and conservative elements\r\ngenerally.[678] It was opposed by the Left, comprising principally the\r\nGerman Liberals, In 1881 the various factions of the German party,\r\nimpelled by the apprehension that German ascendancy might be lost\r\nforever, drew together again and entered upon a policy of opposition\r\nwhich was dictated purely and frankly by racial aspirations.       (p. 478)\r\nAttempts to embarrass the Government by obstruction proved, however,\r\nonly indifferently successful. In 1888 the party was once more\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 678: In the Chamber the Czechs, Poles,\r\n                   and Clericals controlled each approximately 55\r\n                   votes.]\r\n\r\nAmong the diverse groups by which the Taaffe government was supported\r\nthere was just one common interest, namely, the prevention of a return\r\nto power on the part of the German Liberals. Upon this preponderating\r\nconsideration, and upon the otherwise divergent purposes of the\r\nGovernment groups, Taaffe built his system. Maintaining rigidly his\r\ndetermination to permit no radical alteration of the constitution, he\r\nnone the less extended favors freely to the non-Germanic\r\nnationalities, and so contrived to prolong through nearly a decade and\r\na half, by federalist support, an essentially centralist government.\r\nGovernment consisted largely, indeed, in perennial bargaining between\r\nthe executive authorities on the one hand and the parliamentary groups\r\non the other, and in the course of these bargainings it was ever the\r\nlegislative chambers, not the Government, that lost ground. The\r\nbureaucracy increased its hold, the administrative organs waxed\r\nstronger, the power of the Emperor was magnified. The ministry became\r\npre-eminently the ministry of the crown, and despite strictly observed\r\nconstitutional forms the spirit of absolutism was largely\r\nrehabilitated.[679]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 679: The forcefully expressed view of an\r\n                   eminent Austrian authority, written during the\r\n                   parliamentary deadlock which marked the close of\r\n                   the last century, is of interest. \"His [Taaffe's]\r\n                   prolonged ministry had decisive effects upon the\r\n                   political life of Austria. It rendered forever\r\n                   impossible a return to Germanizing centralism. It\r\n                   filled the administrative hierarchy with Slavs,\r\n                   who, remaining Slavs, placed at the service of\r\n                   their national propaganda their official influence.\r\n                   In combatting the Liberal party it restored the\r\n                   power of the court, of the aristocracy, of the\r\n                   Church, and it facilitated the obnoxious\r\n                   restoration of clericalism, by which Austria to-day\r\n                   is dominated. It at the same time aroused and\r\n                   corrupted the nationalities and the parties. It\r\n                   habituated them to give rein unceasingly to their\r\n                   ambitions and to seek to attain them less by their\r\n                   own force and labor than by intrigue. The public\r\n                   demoralization, illustrated to-day so clearly by\r\n                   the Austrian crisis, is properly the result of the\r\n                   Taaffe system.\" M. L. Eisenmann, in Lavisse et\r\n                   Rambaud, Histoire Générale, XII., 177.]\r\n\r\n*530. The German Recovery: Badeni, 1895-1897.*--To the eventual\r\nbreakdown of the Taaffe régime various circumstances contributed. Two\r\nof principal importance were the defection of the Young Czechs and the\r\nfailure of the several attempts to draw to the support of the\r\nGovernment the moderate German Liberals. At the elections of 1891 the\r\nYoung Czechs obtained almost the entire quota of Bohemian seats, and\r\nat the same time the Liberals recovered enough ground to give them the\r\nposition of the preponderant group numerically in the lower chamber.\r\nNeither of these two parties could be persuaded to accord the      (p. 479)\r\nGovernment its support, and during 1891-1893 Taaffe labored vainly\r\nto recover a working coalition. Finally, in 1893, as a last resource,\r\nthe Government resolved to undermine the opposition, especially German\r\nLiberalism, by the abolition of the property qualification for voting\r\nin the cities and rural communes. The nature of Taaffe's electoral\r\nreform bill of 1893 has been explained elsewhere, and likewise the\r\nreason for its rejection.[680] Anticipating the defeat of the measure,\r\nthe premier retired from office October 23, 1893.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 680: See p. 467.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans now recovered, not their earlier power, but none the less\r\na distinct measure of control. November 12 there was established,\r\nunder Prince Windischgrätz a coalition ministry, comprising\r\nrepresentatives of the German Liberals, the Poles, and the Clericals,\r\nand this cabinet was very successful until, in June, 1895, it was\r\nwrecked by the secession of the Liberals on a question of language\r\nreform in Styria. After four months, covered by the colorless ministry\r\nof Count Kielmansegg, Count Badeni became minister-president (October\r\n4, 1895) and made up a cabinet, consisting largely of German Liberals,\r\nbut bent upon an essentially non-partisan administration. The two\r\ntasks chiefly which devolved upon the Badeni ministry were the reform\r\nof the electoral system and the renewal of the decennial economic\r\ncompromise with Hungary, to expire at the end of 1897. The first was\r\naccomplished, very ineffectively, through the electoral measure of\r\n1896; the second, by reason of factional strife, was not accomplished\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n*531. The Language Question: Parliamentary Deadlock.*--The elections of\r\n1897 marked the utter dissolution of both the United German Left and\r\nthe coalition which had borne the designation of the Right. Among the\r\n200 Germans elected to the Chamber there were distinguishable no fewer\r\nthan eight groups; and the number of groups represented in the\r\naggregate membership of 425 was at least twenty-four. Of these the\r\nmost powerful were the Young Czechs, with 60 seats, and the Poles,\r\nwith 59. Profiting by the recently enacted electoral law, the\r\nSocialists at this point made their first appearance in the Reichsrath\r\nwith a total of 14 seats. Taking the Chamber as a whole, there was a\r\nSlavo-Clerical majority, although not the two-thirds requisite for the\r\nenactment of constitutional amendments. The radical opponents of the\r\nGovernment were represented by the 51 German Liberals only. But no one\r\nof the Slavic groups was disposed to accord its support save in return\r\nfor favors received. In the attempt to procure for itself a dependable\r\nmajority the Badeni government succeeded but in creating confusion\r\ntwice confounded. The Young Czechs, whose support appeared         (p. 480)\r\nindispensable, stipulated as a positive condition of that support that\r\nCzech should be recognized as an official language in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia, and by ordinances of April-May, 1897, the Government took it\r\nupon itself to meet this condition. Within the provinces named the two\r\nlanguages, Czech and German, were placed, for official purposes upon a\r\ncommon footing. The only result, however, was to drive the Germans,\r\nalready hostile, to a settled course of parliamentary obstruction, and\r\nbefore the year was out the Badeni cabinet was compelled to retire.\r\n\r\nThe Gautsch ministry which succeeded proposed to maintain the equality\r\nof the Czech and German tongues in Bohemia; wherefore the German\r\nLiberals persisted in their obstructionist policy and declared that\r\nthey would continue to do so until the objectionable ordinances should\r\nhave been rescinded. March 5, 1898, the Government promulgated a\r\nprovisional decree in accordance with which in one portion of Bohemia\r\nthe official tongue was to be Czech, in another German, and in the\r\nthird the two together. But no one was satisfied and the ministry\r\nresigned. The coalition government of Count Thun Hohenstein which\r\nsucceeded labored in the interest of conciliation, but with absolutely\r\nno success. Parliamentary sittings became but occasions for the\r\ndisplay of obstructive tactics, and even for resort to violence, and\r\nlegislation came to a standstill. By the use of every known device the\r\nturbulent German parties rendered impossible the passage of even the\r\nmost necessary money bills, and the upshot was that, in the summer of\r\n1898, the Government was obliged to fall back upon that extraordinary\r\nportion of the Austrian constitution, commonly known as Section 14, by\r\nwhich, in default of parliamentary legislation, the crown is\r\nauthorized to promulgate ordinances with the force of law. The period\r\nof extra parliamentary government here inaugurated was destined to be\r\nextended through more than six years and to comprise one of the most\r\nremarkable chapters in recent political history.\r\n\r\n*532. The Nadir of Parliamentarism.*--Following the retirement of the\r\nThun Hohenstein ministry, at the end of September, 1899, the\r\ngovernment of Count Clary-Aldingen revoked the language decrees; but\r\nthe parliamentary situation was not improved, for the Czechs resorted\r\nforthwith to the same obstructionist tactics of which the Germans had\r\nbeen guilty and the government had still to be operated principally on\r\nthe basis of Section 14. A provisional government under Dr. Wittek, at\r\nthe close of 1899, was followed by the ministry of Dr. Körber,\r\nestablished January 20, 1900; but all attempts at conciliation\r\ncontinued to be unavailing. In September, 1900, the Reichsrath was (p. 481)\r\ndissolved and the order for the new elections was accompanied by the\r\nominous declaration of the Emperor that the present appeal to the\r\nnation would be the last constitutional means which would be employed\r\nto bring the crisis to an end. Amid widespread depression, threats of\r\nHungarian independence, and rumors of an impending _coup d'état_, the\r\nelections took place, in January, 1901. The German parties realized\r\nthe largest gains, but the parliamentary situation was not materially\r\naltered, and thereafter, until its fall, December 31, 1904, the Körber\r\nministry continued to govern substantially without parliamentary\r\nassistance. In 1901-1902, by various promises, the premier induced the\r\ncombatants to lay aside their animosities long enough to vote the\r\nyearly estimates, a military contingent, and certain much-needed\r\neconomic reforms. But this was virtually the sole interruption of a\r\nsix-year deadlock.\r\n\r\n*533. Electoral Reform and the Elections of 1907.*--With the\r\nestablishment of the second Gautsch ministry, December 31, 1904, a\r\ntruce was declared and interest shifted to the carrying out of the\r\nImperial programme of electoral reform. From the proposed\r\nliberalization of the suffrage many of the party groups were certain\r\nto profit and others had at least a chance of doing so; and thus it\r\ncame about that the great electoral law of 1907 was carried through\r\nits various stages under parliamentary conditions which were\r\nsubstantially normal. Its progress was attended by the fall, in April,\r\n1906, of the Gautsch ministry and, six weeks later, by that of its\r\nprovisional successor. But by the coalition government of Baron Beck\r\n(June 2, 1906 to November 8, 1908) the project was pushed to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, and in its final form the law was approved by\r\nthe Emperor, January 26, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of the new electoral measure was followed, May 14, by\r\na general election, the results of which may be tabulated as shown on\r\nthe following page.\r\n\r\nEach of the twenty-six groups here enumerated maintained at the time\r\nof the election an independent party organization, although in the\r\nChamber the representatives of certain of them were accustomed to act\r\nin close co-operation. To the clericals and conservatives of all\r\nshades fell an aggregate of 230 seats; but among the various groups of\r\nthis type there has never been sufficient coherence to permit the\r\nformation of a compact conservative party. Among the liberal and\r\nradical groups lack of coherence was, and remains, still more\r\npronounced. The most striking feature of the election of 1907 was the\r\ngains made by the Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists, to be\r\nexplained largely by the extension of the franchise to the\r\nnon-taxpaying and small taxpaying population.\r\n                                                                   (p. 482)\r\n                                    _Seats after   _Seats in\r\n                                       election of      previous\r\n                                         1907_       Chamber_\r\n\r\n  Social Democrats                         90              11\r\n  Christian Socialists                     67              26\r\n  German Clericals                         29              29\r\n  German Progressives                      23              60\r\n  German Radicals                          24              46\r\n  German Agrarians                         21               4\r\n  Independent Pan-Germans                   8               7\r\n  Pan-Germans                               3              15\r\n  Polish Club                              54              66\r\n  Polish Radicals                          16               0\r\n  Polish Independent Socialists             3               0\r\n  Ruthenes                                 28               9\r\n  Jewish Zionists                           3               0\r\n  Young Czechs                             19              47\r\n  Old Czechs                                6               3\r\n  Czech Realists                            2               0\r\n  Czech Agrarians                          25               5\r\n  Czech Clericals                          19               2\r\n  Czech Radicals                           10               8\r\n  Slovene Clericals                        22              19\r\n  Slovene Liberals                          3               6\r\n  Italian Liberals                          4              12\r\n  Italian Clericals                        10               6\r\n  Croats                                    9               7\r\n  Serbs                                     2               0\r\n  Roumanians                                5               4\r\n\r\n*534. The Elections of 1911.*--The truce by which the election of 1907\r\nwas accompanied was not of long duration, and November 8, 1908, the\r\nministry of Baron Beck was driven by German obstructionism to resign.\r\nAfter three months as provisional premier Baron von Bienerth, former\r\nMinister of the Interior, made up a cabinet which included\r\nrepresentatives of a number of parties and which, despite occasional\r\nreadjustments of portfolios, exhibited a fair measure of stability\r\nthroughout upwards of two years. In December, 1910, the Czechs and\r\nPoles precipitated a cabinet crisis in consequence of which the\r\nministry was reconstructed (January 9, 1911) in such a manner as to\r\nstrengthen the Slavic and weaken the Germanic element. But the forces\r\nof opposition were not appeased, and as a last resort the Government\r\ndetermined upon a dissolution and an appeal to the country. The\r\nresults, however, were by no means those which were desired. At the\r\ngeneral elections, which took place June 13 and 20, the Christian\r\nSocialists, from whom the Government had drawn its most consistent\r\nsupport, were roundly beaten, and June 26 Baron von Bienerth and his\r\ncolleagues resigned. The ministry thereupon made up was presided   (p. 483)\r\nover by Baron Gautsch. It, however, endured only until October 31,\r\nwhen it was succeeded by that of Count Stuergkh.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1911 were hotly contested. The 516 seats to be filled\r\nwere sought by 2,987 candidates, representing no fewer than fifty-one\r\nparties and factions, and second ballotings were required in almost\r\ntwo-thirds of the constituencies. The Czechs returned with\r\nundiminished strength, and the German Radicals and Progressives\r\nrealized substantial gains. The most notable feature, however, was the\r\nvictory of the Social Democrats over the Christian Socialists,\r\nespecially in the capital, where the quota of deputies of the one\r\nparty was raised from ten to nineteen and that of the other was cut\r\nfrom twenty to four. The Christian Socialists, it must be observed,\r\nare not socialists in the ordinary meaning of the term. The party was\r\nfounded by Dr. Lüger a few years ago in the hope that, despite the\r\nestablishment of manhood suffrage in the Empire, the Social Democrats\r\nmight yet be prevented from acquiring a primacy among the German\r\nparties. It is composed largely of clericals, and in tone and purpose\r\nit is essentially reactionary. By maintaining an active alliance with\r\nthe German Clerical party it contrived to hold in check the Social\r\nDemocracy throughout the larger portion of the period 1907-1911. But\r\nit was handicapped all the while by internal dissension, and the\r\ndefeat which it suffered at the last elections has relegated it, at\r\nleast for the time being, to a subordinate place.[681]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 681: On Austrian party politics see\r\n                   Lowell, Governments and Parties, II., 94-123;\r\n                   Drage, Austria-Hungary, Chaps, 1, 3, 12; K.\r\n                   Schwechler, Die österreichische Sozialdemokratie\r\n                   (Graz, 1907); S.

THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*535. General Principles: the Ordinary Tribunals.*--All judicial power\r\nin the Austrian Empire is exercised, and all judgments and sentences\r\nare executed, in the name of the Emperor. Judges are appointed for\r\nlife, by the Emperor or in his name, and they may be removed from  (p. 484)\r\noffice only under circumstances specified by law and by virtue of\r\na formal judicial sentence. On taking the oath of office all judicial\r\nofficials are required to pledge themselves to an inviolable\r\nobservance of the fundamental laws. The Law of December 21, 1867,\r\nconcerning the Judicial Power withholds from the courts the power to\r\npronounce upon the validity of statutes properly promulgated, though\r\nthey may render judgment on the validity of Imperial ordinances\r\ninvolved in cases before them.[682] With some exceptions, fixed by\r\nlaw, proceedings in both civil and criminal cases are required to be\r\noral and public; and in all cases involving severe penalties, as well\r\nas in all actions arising from political crimes and misdemeanors and\r\noffenses committed by the press, the guilt or innocence of the accused\r\nmust be determined by jury.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 682: Art. 7. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 86.]\r\n\r\nBy the law of 1867 it is stipulated that there shall be maintained at\r\nVienna a Supreme Court of Justice and Cassation (_Oberste Gerichts-und\r\nKassationshof_) for all of the kingdoms and countries represented in\r\nthe Reichsrath, and that the organization and jurisdiction of inferior\r\ncourts shall be determined by law. Of inferior tribunals there have been\r\nestablished 9 higher provincial courts (_Oberlandesgerichte_),[683]\r\n74 provincial and district courts (_Landes-und Kreisgerichte_), and 96\r\ncounty courts (_Bezirksgerichte_). The provincial and district courts\r\nand the county courts, together with a group of jury courts maintained\r\nin connection with the provincial and district tribunals, are courts\r\nof first instance; the higher provincial courts and the Supreme Court\r\nexercise a jurisdiction that is almost wholly appellate. There exist\r\nalso special courts for commercial, industrial, military, fiscal, and\r\nother varieties of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 683: Located at Vienna, Graz, Trieste,\r\n                   Innsbrück, Zara, Prague, Brünn, Cracow, and\r\n                   Lemberg.]\r\n\r\n*536. The Imperial Court.*--In Austria, as in France and other\r\ncontinental countries, cases affecting administration and the\r\nadministrative officials are withheld from the jurisdiction of the\r\nordinary courts and are committed to special administrative tribunals.\r\nBy law of 1867 provision was made for an Imperial Court (_Reichsgericht_),\r\nto exercise final decision in conflicts of jurisdiction between the\r\ntwo sets of courts and, in general, in all disputed questions of\r\npublic law, after the manner of the Court of Conflicts in France. The\r\nImperial Court was organized by law of April 18, 1869. It sits at\r\nVienna, and it is composed of a president and deputy president,\r\nappointed by the Emperor for life, and of twelve members and four\r\nsubstitutes, also appointed for life by the Emperor upon nomination by\r\nthe Reichsrath. It decides finally all conflicts of competence     (p. 485)\r\nbetween the administrative and the ordinary judicial tribunals,\r\nbetween a provincial diet and the Imperial authorities, and between\r\nthe independent public authorities of the several provinces of the\r\nEmpire. Very important in a country so dominated by a bureaucracy as\r\nis Austria is the power which by fundamental law is vested in the\r\nImperial Court to pass final verdict upon the merits of all complaints\r\nof citizens arising out of the alleged violation of political rights\r\nguaranteed to them by the constitution, after the matter shall have\r\nbeen made the subject of an administrative decision. The purpose\r\ninvolved is to afford the citizen who, believing himself deprived of\r\nhis constitutional rights, has failed to obtain redress in the\r\nadministrative courts, an opportunity to have his case reviewed by a\r\ntribunal constituted with special view to permanence, independence,\r\nand impartiality. High-handed administrative acts which are covered by\r\nstatute, however, are beyond its reach, for, like all Austrian\r\ntribunals, it is forbidden to question the validity of a duly\r\npromulgated law.[684]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 684: Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I.,\r\n                   84-85.]\r\n\r\n*537. The Provincial Governments: Composition of the Diet.*--Each of the\r\nseventeen political divisions of the Empire has a government of its\r\nown, established on the basis of its Landesordnung, or provincial\r\nconstitution. The executive, for affairs that are considered strictly\r\ndivisional, consists of a provincial council, the _Landesausschuss_,\r\ncomposed of the president of the diet (nominated by the Emperor) as\r\n_ex-officio_ chairman and from four to eight members variously elected\r\nwithin the province. Imperial interests are specially represented in\r\nthe province, however, by a _Statthalter_, or _Landespräsident_,\r\nappointed by the crown, and independent of local control.\r\n\r\nFunctions of legislation are vested in a Landtag, or diet. The\r\nprovincial diet of the modern type came into being under the operation\r\nof the Imperial diploma of October 20, 1860 (superseded by that of\r\nFebruary 26, 1861), replacing the ancient assembly of estates which in\r\nmost provinces had persisted until 1848. From 1860 onwards diets were\r\nestablished in one after another of the provinces, until eventually\r\nall were so equipped. Originally the diets were substantially uniform\r\nin respect to both composition and powers. Aside from certain\r\n_ex-officio_ members, they were composed of deputies chosen for six\r\nyears by four electoral curiæ: the great proprietors, the chambers of\r\ncommerce, the towns, and the rural communes; and, until 1873, one of\r\ntheir principal functions was the election of the provincial\r\ndelegation in the lower house of the Reichsrath. Each of the seventeen\r\nprovincial diets as to-day constituted consists of a single chamber,\r\nand in most instances the body is composed of (1) the archbishops  (p. 486)\r\nand bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Greek churches; (2) the\r\nrectors of universities, and, in Galicia, the rector of the technical\r\nhigh school of Lemberg and the president of the Academy of Sciences of\r\nCracow; (3) the representatives of great estates, elected by all\r\nlandowners paying land taxes of not less than 100, 200, 400, or 500\r\ncrowns, according to the provinces in which their estates are\r\nsituated; (4) the representatives of towns, elected by citizens who\r\npossess municipal rights or pay a stipulated amount of direct taxes;\r\n(5) the representatives of boards of commerce and industry, chosen by\r\nthe members of these bodies; and (6) representatives of the rural\r\ncommunes, elected in eight provinces directly, in the others\r\nindirectly, by deputies (Wahlmänner) returned by all inhabitants who\r\npay direct taxes to the amount of 8 crowns yearly. In a few of the\r\nprovinces there is, besides these, a general electoral class composed\r\nof all qualified male subjects of the state over twenty-four years of\r\nage;[685] and there are some other variations, as for example, in\r\nMoravia, where, by a law of November 27, 1905, the proportional system\r\nof representation was introduced. The diets vary in membership from 26\r\nin Vorarlberg and 30 in Görz and Gradisca to 151 in Moravia, 161 in\r\nGalicia, and 242 in Bohemia. The deputies are elected in all cases for\r\na period of six years, and the diets assemble annually. But a session\r\nmay be closed, and the diet may be dissolved, at any time by the\r\npresiding officer, under the direction of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 685: When the class system of voting for\r\n                   members of the Reichsrath was on the point of being\r\n                   abolished by the law of January 26, 1907, there was\r\n                   raised the question as to whether a similar step\r\n                   should not be taken in respect to provincial\r\n                   elections. It was generally agreed, however, that\r\n                   the absence of an aristocratic upper chamber in the\r\n                   provincial diet renders the class system within the\r\n                   province not wholly undesirable. The provinces were\r\n                   encouraged to liberalize their franchise\r\n                   regulations, but not to abandon the prevailing\r\n                   electoral system. The province of Lower Austria led\r\n                   the way by increasing the membership of its diet\r\n                   from 79 to 127, to be elected as follows: 58 by\r\n                   manhood suffrage throughout the province, 31 by the\r\n                   rural communes, 16 by the large landholders, 15 by\r\n                   the towns, and 4 by the chambers of commerce. Two\r\n                   bishops and the rector of the University of Vienna\r\n                   were continued as members.]\r\n\r\n*538. Functions of the Diet.*--The powers of the diets are not\r\nenumerated, but, rather, are residual. By fundamental law of 1867 it\r\nis stipulated that \"all matters of legislation other than those\r\nexpressly reserved to the Reichsrath by the present law belong within\r\nthe power of the Provincial Diets of the kingdoms and countries\r\nrepresented in the Reichsrath and are constitutionally regulated by\r\nsuch Diets.\"[686] In certain matters, naturally those of an        (p. 487)\r\nessentially local character, the diet may act with absolute freedom,\r\nsave that it is within the competence of the Emperor to veto any of\r\nits measures. In other matters, such as education and finance, which\r\nfall within the range of the Reichsrath's competence, the powers of\r\nthe diet are limited and subsidiary. A policy very generally pursued\r\nhas been that of formulating at Vienna general regulations for the\r\nentire Empire, leaving to the diets the task of devising legislation\r\nof a local and specific character for the execution of these\r\nregulations; though it can hardly be maintained that the results have\r\nbeen satisfactory. The diets are not infrequently radical, and even\r\nturbulent, bodies, and it has been deemed expedient ordinarily by the\r\nImperial authorities to maintain a close watch upon their proceedings.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 686: Law of December 21, 1867, concerning\r\n                   Imperial Representation, § 12. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 79.]\r\n\r\n*539. The Commune.*--Throughout the Empire the vital unit of local\r\ngovernment is the commune. As is true of the province, the commune is\r\nan administrative district, and one of its functions is that of\r\nserving as an agency of the central government in the conduct of\r\npublic affairs. Fundamentally, however, the commune is an autonomous\r\norganism, rooted in local interest and tradition. As such, it\r\nexercises broad powers of community control. It makes provision for\r\nthe safety of person and property, for the maintenance of the local\r\npeace, for the supervision of traffic, for elementary and secondary\r\neducation, and for a variety of other local interests. Except in\r\nrespect to affairs managed by the commune as agent of the Imperial\r\ngovernment, the local authorities are exempt from discipline at the\r\nhand of their superiors, and, indeed, an eminent Austrian authority\r\nhas gone so far as to maintain that the communes of Austria possess a\r\nlarger independent competence than do the communes of any other\r\nEuropean state.[687]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 687: J. Redlich, Das Wesen der\r\n                   österreichischen Kommunalverfassung (Leipzig,\r\n                   1910).]\r\n\r\nExcept in the case of some of the larger towns, which have special\r\nconstitutions, the rural and urban communes of the Empire are\r\norganized upon the same pattern. The executive authority is vested in\r\nan elective committee, or council, presided over by a _Vorsteher_, or\r\nburgomaster, chosen from the members of the committee. The _Vorsteher_\r\nis not removable by the central authorities, and over his election\r\nthey possess no control. In certain of the towns the place of the\r\ncommunal committee is taken by a corporation. In every commune there\r\nis an assembly (the _Gemeindevertretung_), the members of which are\r\nelected for three (in Galicia six) years by all resident citizens who\r\nare payers of a direct tax. For the purpose of electing assemblymen\r\nthe voters are divided into three classes, very much as under the  (p. 488)\r\nPrussian electoral system, and this arrangement, indeed, comprises\r\nvirtually the only non-democratic aspect of the communal constitution.\r\nIn Galicia, Styria, and Bohemia there exists also a district assembly,\r\nelected for three years (in Galicia six) and made up of\r\nrepresentatives of great estates, the most highly taxed industries and\r\ntrades, towns and markets, and rural communes. A committee of this\r\nbody, known as the _Bezirksausschuss_, administers the affairs of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI                                                       (p. 489)\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND PARTIES OF HUNGARY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n*540. Antiquity.*--By reason of both its antiquity and its adaptability\r\nto varying conditions, the constitution of the kingdom of Hungary\r\ndeserves to be considered one of the most remarkable instruments of\r\nits kind. Like the fundamental law of England, it is embodied in a\r\nmaze of ancient statutes and customs, and it is the distinctive\r\ncreation of a people possessed of a rare genius for politics and\r\ngovernment. On the documentary side its history is to be traced at\r\nleast to the Golden Bull of Andrew II., promulgated in 1222; though\r\nthat instrument, like the contemporary Great Charter in England,\r\ncomprised only a confirmation of national liberties that were already\r\nold.[688] Under Hapsburg domination, from the early sixteenth century\r\nonwards, the fundamental political system and the long established\r\nlaws of the Hungarian kingdom were repeatedly guaranteed. Much of the\r\ntime they were, in practice, disregarded; but the nationalistic vigor\r\nof the Hungarian people invested them with unlimited power of\r\nsurvival, and even during the reactionary second quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century they were but held in suspense.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 688: There is an interesting comparative\r\n                   study of the _Bulla Aurea_ and the Great Charter in\r\n                   E. Hantos, The Magna Carta of the English and of\r\n                   the Hungarian Constitution (London, 1904).]\r\n\r\n*541. Texts: the \"March Laws.\"*--In large part, the constitution to-day\r\nin operation took final form in a series of measures enacted by the\r\nHungarian parliament during the uprising of 1848. Thirty-one laws, in\r\nall, were at that time passed, revising the organization of the\r\nlegislative chambers, widening the suffrage, creating a responsible\r\ncabinet, abolishing feudal survivals, and modernizing, in general, the\r\ninstitutions of the kingdom. The broad lines which remained were those\r\nmarked out in the ancient constitutional order; the new measures\r\nmerely supplemented, revised, and imparted definite form to\r\npre-existing laws, customs, and jealously guarded rights. Not all of\r\nthese inherited constitutional elements, however, were included in the\r\nnew statutes; and to this day it is true that in Hungary, as in    (p. 490)\r\nGreat Britain, a considerable portion of the constitution has never\r\nbeen put into written form. The fate of the measures of 1848 was for a\r\ntime adverse. The Austrian recovery in 1849 remanded Hungary to the\r\nstatus of a subject province, and it was not until 1867, after seven\r\nyears of arduous experimentation, that the constitution of 1848 was\r\npermitted again to come into operation. The Ausgleich involved as one\r\nof its fundamentals a guarantee for all time of the laws, constitution,\r\nlegal independence, freedom, and territorial integrity of Hungary and\r\nits subordinate countries. And throughout all of the unsettlement and\r\nconflict which the past half-century has brought in the Austro-Hungarian\r\nworld the constitution of kingdom and empire alike has stood firm\r\nagainst every shock. The documents in which, chiefly, the written\r\nconstitution is contained are: (1) Law III. of 1848 concerning the\r\nFormation of a Responsible Hungarian Ministry; (2) Law IV. of 1848\r\nconcerning Annual Sessions of the Diet; (3) Law XXXIII. of 1874\r\nconcerning the Modification and Amendment of Law V. of 1848, and of\r\nthe Transylvanian Law II. of 1848; and (4) Law VII. of 1885 altering\r\nthe organization of the Table of Magnates.[689]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 689: The texts of all of the fundamental\r\n                   laws of Hungary at present in operation are printed\r\n                   in G.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY                                     (p. 491)\r\n\r\n*542. The Working Executive.*--The constitutional arrangements\r\nrespecting the executive branch of the Hungarian government are set\r\nforth principally in Law III. of 1848 \"concerning the Formation of a\r\nResponsible Hungarian Ministry.\" The king attains his position _ipso\r\njure_, by reason of being Emperor of Austria, without the necessity of\r\nany distinct act of public law. Within six months of his accession at\r\nVienna he is crowned monarch of Hungary at Budapest, in a special\r\nceremony in which is used the crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. upwards\r\nof a thousand years ago to King Stephen. The new sovereign is required\r\nto proffer Parliament an \"inaugural certificate,\" as well as to take a\r\ncoronation oath, to the effect that he will maintain the fundamental\r\nlaws and liberties of the country; and both of these instruments are\r\nincorporated among the officially published documents of the realm.\r\nThe entire proceeding partakes largely of the character of a\r\ncontractual arrangement between nation and sovereign.\r\n\r\nAs in Austria, the powers of the crown are exercised very largely\r\nthrough the ministry. And, by reason of the peculiar safeguards in the\r\nHungarian laws against royal despotism, as well as the all but\r\nuninterrupted absence of the king from the dominion, the ministry at\r\nBudapest not only constitutes the Hungarian executive in every real\r\nsense, but it operates on a much more purely parliamentary basis than\r\ndoes its counterpart at Vienna. \"His Majesty,\" says the law of 1848,\r\n\"shall exercise the executive power in conformity with law, through\r\nthe independent Hungarian ministry, and no ordinance, order, decision,\r\nor appointment shall have force unless it is countersigned by one of\r\nthe ministers residing at Budapest.\"[690] Every measure of the crown\r\nmust be countersigned by a minister; and every minister is immediately\r\nand actually responsible to Parliament for all of his official acts.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 690: Law III. of 1848, § 3. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 94.]\r\n\r\n*543. Composition and Status of the Ministry.*--The ministry consists of\r\na president of the council, or premier, and the heads of nine\r\ndepartments, as follows: Finance, National Defense, Interior,\r\nEducation and Public Worship, Justice, Industry and Commerce,\r\nAgriculture, the Ministry for Croatia and Slavonia, and the Ministry\r\nnear the King's Person. The last-mentioned portfolio exists by virtue\r\nof the constitutional requirement that \"one of the ministers shall\r\nalways be in attendance upon the person of His Majesty, and shall take\r\npart in all affairs which are common to Hungary and the hereditary\r\nprovinces, and in such affairs he shall, under his responsibility,\r\nrepresent Hungary.\"[691] All ministers are appointed by the king,  (p. 492)\r\non nomination of the premier. All have seats in Parliament and must be\r\nheard in either chamber when they desire to speak. They are bound,\r\nindeed, to attend the sessions of either house when requested, to\r\nsubmit official papers for examination, and to give \"proper\r\nexplanations\" respecting governmental policies. They may be impeached\r\nby vote of a majority of the lower chamber, in which event the trial\r\nis held before a tribunal of twelve judges chosen by secret ballot by\r\nthe upper house from among its own members. Inasmuch, however, as the\r\nlower house has acquired the power by a simple vote of want of\r\nconfidence to compel a cabinet to resign, the right of impeachment\r\npossesses in practice small value. The ministry is required to submit\r\nonce a year to the lower house for its examination and approval a\r\nstatement of the income and needs of the country, together with an\r\naccount of the income administered by it during the past twelve\r\nmonths.[692]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 691: Law III. of 1848, § 13. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 94.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 692: Law III. of 1848, § 37. Ibid., I.,\r\n                   97.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PARLIAMENT--THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n*544. The Table of Magnates.*--The Hungarian parliament consists of two\r\nhouses, whose official designations are _Förendihaz_--Table, or\r\nChamber, of Magnates--and _Képviselöház_, or Chamber of Deputies. The\r\nupper house is essentially a perpetuation of the ancient Table of\r\nMagnates which, in the sixteenth century, began to sit separately as\r\nan aristocratic body made up of the great dignitaries of the kingdom,\r\nthe Catholic episcopate (also, after 1792, that of the Orthodox Greek\r\nChurch), the \"supreme courts,\" and the adult sons of titled families.\r\nThe reforms of 1848 left the Chamber untouched, though its composition\r\nwas modified slightly in 1885.[693] At the session of 1910-1911 it\r\ncontained 16 archdukes of the royal family (eighteen years of age or\r\nover); 15 state dignitaries; 2 presidents of the High Courts of\r\nAppeal; 42 archbishops and bishops of the Roman Catholic and Greek\r\nOrthodox churches; 13 representatives of the Lutheran, Calvinist, and\r\nUnitarian faiths; 236 members of the hereditary aristocracy (i.e.,\r\nthose of the whole number of the nobility who pay a land tax to the\r\namount of at least 6,000 crowns annually); 3 members elected by the\r\nprovincial diet of Croatia; and 60 life peers, appointed by the crown\r\nor chosen by the Chamber of Magnates itself--a total of 387.[694] The\r\nmembership is therefore exceedingly complex, resting on the        (p. 493)\r\nvarious principles of hereditary right, _ex-officio_ qualification,\r\nroyal nomination, and election. In practice the upper house is\r\ndistinctly subordinate to the lower, to which alone the ministers are\r\nresponsible. Any member may acquire, by due process of election, a\r\nseat in the lower chamber, and the privilege is one of which the more\r\nambitious peers are not reluctant to avail themselves. Upon election\r\nto the lower house a peer's right to sit in the upper chamber is, of\r\ncourse, suspended; but when the term of service in the popular branch\r\nhas expired, the prior right is revived automatically.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 693: Law VII. of 1885 altering the\r\n                   Organization of the Table of Magnates. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 100-105.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 694: The number is, of course, variable.\r\n                   The old Table of Magnates was a very large body,\r\n                   consisting of more than 800 members.]\r\n\r\n*545. The Chamber of Deputies: the Franchise.*--By law of 1848, amended\r\nin 1874, it is stipulated that the Chamber of Deputies, historically\r\ndescended from the ancient Table of Nuncios, shall consist of 453\r\nmembers, \"who shall enjoy equal voting power, and who shall be elected\r\nin accordance with an apportionment made on the basis of population,\r\nterritory, and economic conditions.\"[695] Of the total number of\r\nmembers, 413 are representatives of Hungary proper and 40 are\r\ndelegates of the subordinate kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and\r\nDalmatia. This kingdom possesses its own organs of government,\r\nincluding a unicameral diet which exercises independent legislative\r\npower in all internal affairs. Its forty deputies take part in the\r\nproceedings at Budapest only when subjects are under consideration\r\nwhich are of common concern to all of the countries of St. Stephen's\r\ncrown, such as questions pertaining to finance, war, communications,\r\nand relations with Austria.[696]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 695: Law V. of 1848 concerning the\r\n                   Election of Representatives, § 5. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 105.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 696: On the status of the Croatian\r\n                   kingdom see p. 507.]\r\n\r\nThe election of deputies is governed by an elaborate statute of\r\nNovember 10, 1874, by which were perpetuated the fundamentals of the\r\nelectoral law of 1848. In respect to procedure, the system was further\r\namended by a measure of 1899. Qualifications for the exercise of the\r\nsuffrage are based on age, property, taxation, profession, official\r\nposition, and ancestral privileges. Nominally liberal, they are, in\r\nactual operation, notoriously illiberal. The prescribed age for an\r\nelector is twenty years, indeed, as compared with twenty-four in\r\nAustria; but the qualifications based upon property-holding are so\r\nexacting that they more than offset the liberality therein involved.\r\nThese qualifications--too complicated to be enumerated here--vary\r\naccording as they arise from capital, industry, occupation, or\r\nproperty-holding. With slight restrictions, the right to vote is\r\npossessed without regard to property or income, by members of the\r\nHungarian Academy of Sciences, professors, notaries public,        (p. 494)\r\nengineers, surgeons, druggists, graduates of agricultural schools,\r\nforesters, clergymen, chaplains, and teachers. On the other hand,\r\nstate officials, soldiers in active service, customs employees, and\r\nthe police have no vote; servants, apprenticed workingmen, and\r\nagricultural laborers are carefully excluded; and there are the usual\r\ndisqualifications for crime, bankruptcy, guardianship, and deprivation\r\nby judicial process. In an aggregate population of approximately\r\n20,000,000 to-day there are not more than 1,100,000 electors.\r\n\r\n*546. The Magyar Domination.*--The explanation of this state of affairs\r\nis to be sought in the ethnographical composition of Hungary's\r\npopulation. Like Austria, Hungary contains a _mélange_ of races and\r\nnationalities. The original Hungarians are the Magyars, and by the\r\nMagyar element attempt has been made always to preserve as against the\r\naffiliated German and Slavic peoples an absolute superiority of\r\nsocial, economic, and political power. The Magyars occupy almost\r\nexclusively the more desirable portion of the country, i.e., the great\r\ncentral plain intersected by the Danube and the Theiss, where they\r\npreponderate decidedly in as many as nineteen counties. Clustered\r\naround them, and in more or less immediate touch with kindred peoples\r\nbeyond the borders, are the Germans and the Slavs--the Slovaks in the\r\nmountains of the north, the Ruthenes on the slopes of the Carpathians,\r\nthe Serbs on the southeast, and the Croats on the southwest. When the\r\ncensus of 1900 was taken the total population of Hungary (including\r\nCroatia-Slavonia) was 19,254,559. Of this number 8,742,301 were\r\nMagyars; 8,029,316 were Slavs; 2,135,181 were Germans; and 397,761\r\nwere of various minor racial groups. To put it differently, the\r\nMagyars numbered 8,742,301; the non-Magyars, 10,512,258. The\r\nfundamental fault of the Hungarian electorate is that it has been\r\nshaped, and is deliberately maintained, in the interest of a race\r\nwhich comprises numerically but 45.4 per cent of the country's\r\npopulation.[697] So skillfully, indeed, have electoral qualifications\r\nand electoral proceedings been devised in the Magyar interest that the\r\nnon-Magyar majority has but meager representation, and still less\r\ninfluence, at Budapest.[698] Even in Hungary proper the electorate in\r\n1906 comprised but 24.4 per cent of the male population over twenty\r\nyears of age; and, despite the disqualifications that have been\r\nmentioned one-fourth of the men who vote are officials or employees of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 697: It is but fair to say that in\r\n                   Hungary proper the Magyar percentage in 1900 was\r\n                   51.4.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 698: Of the 413 representatives of\r\n                   Hungary at Budapest in 1909, but 26 were\r\n                   non-Magyars, and after the elections of June, 1910,\r\n                   but 7.]\r\n\r\n*547. The Demand for Electoral Reform: the Franchise Reform Bill   (p. 495)\r\nof 1908.*--In recent years, especially since the Austrian electoral\r\nreform of 1906-1907, there has been in Hungary an increasingly\r\ninsistent demand that the Magyar parliamentary hegemony be overthrown,\r\nor at least that there be assured to the non-Magyar peoples something\r\nlike a proportionate share of political influence. As early as 1905\r\nthe recurrence of legislative deadlocks at Budapest influenced Francis\r\nJoseph to ally himself with the democratic elements of the kingdom and\r\nto declare for manhood suffrage; and in the legislative programme of\r\nthe Fejérváry government, made public October 28, 1905, the place of\r\nprincipal importance was assigned to this reform. Fearing the swamping\r\nof the popular chamber by the Slavs and Germans, the Magyars steadily\r\nopposed all change, and for the time being the mere threat on the part\r\nof the Government was sufficient to restore tolerable, if not normal,\r\nparliamentary conditions. The Wekerle coalition cabinet of 1900\r\nannounced electoral reform as one of its projected tasks, but as time\r\nelapsed it became apparent that no positive action was likely to be\r\ntaken. During 1907 and 1908 riotous demonstrations on the part of the\r\ndisappointed populace were frequent, and at last, November 11, 1908,\r\nCount Andrássy, Minister of the Interior, introduced in the Chamber\r\nthe long-awaited Franchise Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nThe measure fell far short of public expectation. It was drawn, as\r\nCount Andrássy himself admitted, in such a manner as not \"to\r\ncompromise the Magyar character of the Hungarian state.\" After a\r\nfashion, it conceded manhood suffrage. But, to the end that the Magyar\r\nhegemony might be preserved, it imposed upon the exercise of the\r\nfranchise such a number of restrictions and assigned to plural voting\r\nsuch an aggregate of weight that its concessions were regarded by\r\nthose who were expected to be benefited by it as practically\r\nvalueless. The essentials of the measure were: (1) citizens unable to\r\nread and write Hungarian should be excluded from voting directly,\r\nthough they might choose one elector for every ten of their number,\r\nand each elector so chosen should be entitled to one vote; (2) every\r\nmale citizen able to read and write Hungarian should be invested, upon\r\ncompleting his twenty-fourth year and fulfilling a residence\r\nrequirement of twelve months, with one vote; (3) electors who had\r\npassed four standards of a secondary school,[699] or who paid yearly a\r\ndirect tax amounting to at least twenty crowns ($4.16), or who\r\nfulfilled various other conditions, should be entitled to two votes;\r\nand (4) electors who had completed the course of secondary instruction,\r\nor who paid a direct tax of 100 crowns (approximately $21), should (p. 496)\r\nbe possessed of three votes. As before, voting was to be oral and\r\npublic. In the preamble of the measure the cynical observation was\r\noffered that \"the secret ballot protects electors in dependent\r\npositions only in so far as they break their promises under the veil\r\nof secrecy.\" It was announced that the passage of the bill would be\r\nfollowed by the presentation of a scheme for the redistribution of\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 699: Equivalent to the completion of\r\n                   one-half of the course of secondary instruction.]\r\n\r\n*548. Rejection of the Bill.*--According to calculations of the _Neue\r\nFreie Presse_, the effect of the measure would have been to increase\r\nthe aggregate body of electors from 1,100,000 to 2,600,000, and the\r\nnumber of votes to something like 4,000,000. The number of persons\r\nentitled to three votes was estimated at 200,000; to two votes, at\r\n860,000; to one vote, at 1,530,000; to no vote, at 1,270,000. An\r\naggregate of 1,060,000 persons in the first two classes would cast\r\n2,320,000 votes; an aggregate of 2,800,000 in the last two would cast\r\n1,530,000 votes. The number of persons participating in parliamentary\r\nelections would be more than doubled, but political power would remain\r\nwhere it was already lodged. The measure would have operated, indeed,\r\nto strengthen the Magyar position, and while the Germans would have\r\nprofited somewhat by it, the Slavs would have lost largely such power\r\nas they at present possess. Based as the scheme was upon a curious\r\nelaboration of the educational qualification, it was recognized\r\ninstantly, both in the kingdom and outside, as an instrument of\r\ndeliberate Magyar domination. Among the Slavic populations the\r\nprevalence of illiteracy is such that the number of persons who could\r\nattain the possession of even one direct vote would be insignificant.\r\nBy the Socialists, and by the radical and Slavic elements generally,\r\nthe scheme was denounced as a sheer caricature of the universal,\r\nequal, and direct suffrage for which demand had been made.\r\n\r\nUpon the introduction of the bill parliamentary discord broke out\r\nafresh, and through 1909 there was a deadlock which effectually\r\nprevented the enactment of even the necessary measures of finance. In\r\nJanuary, 1910, the sovereign at last succeeded in securing a new\r\nministry, presided over by Count Hedérváry, and in the programme of\r\nthis Government the introduction of manhood suffrage was accorded a\r\nplace of principal importance. June 26, 1910, the Speech from the\r\nThrone, at the opening of the newly elected parliament, announced that\r\na franchise bill would be submitted \"on the basis of universal\r\nsuffrage and in complete maintenance of the unitary national character\r\nof the Hungarian state.\" Various circumstances co-operated, however,\r\nto impose delay and, despite the sovereign's reiterated interest in\r\nthe reform, no action as yet has been taken. The Hungarian franchise\r\nremains the most illiberal and the most antiquated in Europe. The  (p. 497)\r\nracial situation seems utterly to preclude the possibility of a reform\r\nthat will be in all respects satisfactory; indeed, it seems almost to\r\npreclude the possibility of reform at all. Yet, that the pressure will\r\nbe continued until eventually there shall be an overhauling of the\r\npresent inadequate system can hardly be doubted.[700]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 700: On the question of the Hungarian\r\n                   suffrage see S.

Electoral Procedure.*--Elections are conducted in each town or\r\n_comitat_ (county) by a central electoral committee of at least twelve\r\nmembers, chosen by the municipal council of the town or by the general\r\ncouncil of the _comitat_. The list of voters in each district is drawn\r\nup by a sub-committee of this body. When an election is to be held,\r\nthe Minister of the Interior fixes, thirty days in advance, a period\r\nof ten days during which the polling must be completed. As in Great\r\nBritain, the elections do not take place simultaneously, and a\r\ncandidate defeated in one constituency may stand, and possibly be\r\nsuccessful, in another. All polling within a particular town or\r\n_comitat_, however, is concluded within one day. Candidates may be\r\nnominated by any ten electors of the district, and candidacies may be\r\ndeclared until within thirty minutes of the hour (eight o'clock A. M.)\r\nfor the polling to begin.\r\n\r\nVoting is everywhere public and oral. Each elector, after giving his\r\nname and establishing his identity, simply proclaims in a loud voice\r\nthe name of the candidate for whom he desires to have his vote\r\nrecorded. If no candidate obtains an absolute majority, the central\r\ncommittee fixes a date (at least fourteen days distant) for a second\r\npolling, on which occasion the contest lies between the two candidates\r\nwho at the first balloting polled the largest number of votes. Prior\r\nto a law of 1899 defining jurisdiction in electoral matters, Hungarian\r\nelections were tempestuous, and not infrequently scandalous. Beginning\r\nwith the elections of 1901, however, electoral manners have shown\r\nconsiderable improvement; though ideal conditions can hardly be\r\nrealized until oral voting shall have been replaced by the secret\r\nballot.[701] Any elector who has attained the age of twenty-four,  (p. 498)\r\nis a registered voter, and can speak Magyar (the official language of\r\nHungarian parliamentary proceedings) is eligible as a candidate.\r\nDeputies receive a stipend of 4,800 crowns a year, with an allowance\r\nof 1,600 crowns for house rent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 701: Seatus Viator, Corruption and Reform\r\n                   in Hungary: a Study of Electoral Practice (London,\r\n                   1911).]\r\n\r\n*550. Parliamentary Organization and Procedure.*--The national\r\nparliament assembles in regular session once a year at Budapest.\r\nFollowing a general election, the Chamber of Deputies meets, under the\r\npresidency of its oldest member, after a lapse of time (not exceeding\r\nthirty days) fixed by the royal letters of convocation. The Chamber of\r\nMagnates being convoked by the crown at the same date, all members\r\nrepair to the royal palace to hear the Speech from the Throne, which\r\nis delivered by the king in person or by an especially appointed royal\r\ncommissioner.[702] The lower chamber then passes upon the validity of\r\nthe election of its members, though by law of 1899 the actual exercise\r\nof this jurisdiction is committed in large part to the Royal High\r\nCourt.[703] The president and vice-president of the Chamber of\r\nMagnates are appointed by the king from the members of that house; the\r\nsecretaries are elected by the house from its own members, by secret\r\nballot. The lower house elects, from its members, all of its\r\nofficials--a president, two vice-presidents, and a number of\r\nsecretaries. The presidents of the two houses are chosen for the\r\nentire period of the parliament; all other officials are chosen\r\nannually at the beginning of a session.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 702: King Francis Joseph I. has been\r\n                   absent upon this important occasion but once since\r\n                   1867. Apponyi, in Alden, Hungary of To-day, 166.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 703: Ibid., 166-175.]\r\n\r\nEach house is authorized, at its first annual session after an\r\nelection, to adopt an order of business and to make the necessary\r\nregulations for the maintenance of peace and propriety in its\r\ndeliberations. The president, with the aid of sergeants-at-arms, is\r\ncharged with the strict enforcement of all such rules. Sittings of the\r\ntwo houses are required to be public, but spectators who disturb the\r\nproceedings may be excluded. The maximum life of a parliament was\r\nraised, in 1886, from three years to five. It is within the power of\r\nthe king, however, not only to extend or to adjourn the annual\r\nsession, but to dissolve the lower chamber before the expiration of\r\nthe five-year period. In the event of a dissolution, orders are\r\nrequired to be given for a national election, and these orders must be\r\nso timed that the new parliament may be assembled within, at the most,\r\nthree months after the dissolution. And there is the further requirement\r\nthat, in the event of a dissolution before the budget shall have   (p. 499)\r\nbeen voted for the ensuing year, the convocation of the new parliament\r\nshall be provided for within such a period as will permit the\r\nestimates for the succeeding year to be considered before the close of\r\nthe current year.\r\n\r\n*551. The Powers of Parliament: the Parliamentary System.*--In the\r\nHungarian constitutional system Parliament is in a very real sense\r\nsupreme. The king can exercise his prerogatives only through ministers\r\nwho are responsible to the lower chamber, and all arrangements\r\npertaining to the welfare of the state fall within the competence of\r\nthe legislative branch. Within Parliament it is the Chamber of\r\nDeputies that preponderates. Aside from the king and ministry, it\r\nalone enjoys the power of initiating legislation; and the opposition\r\nwith which the Chamber of Magnates may be disposed to meet its\r\nmeasures invariably melts away after a show of opinion has been made.\r\nBy a simple majority vote in the lower chamber a minister may be\r\nimpeached for bribery, negligence, or any act detrimental to the\r\nindependence of the country, the constitution, individual liberty, or\r\nproperty rights. Trial is held before a tribunal composed of men\r\nchosen by secret ballot by the Chamber of Magnates from its own\r\nmembers. For the purpose thirty-six members in all are required to be\r\nelected. Of the number, twelve may be rejected by the impeachment\r\ncommission of the lower house, and twelve others by the minister or\r\nministers under impeachment. Those remaining, at least twelve in\r\nnumber, try the case. Procedure is required to be public and the\r\npenalty to be \"fixed in proportion to the offense.\"[704]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 704: Law III. of 1848 concerning the\r\n                   Formation of a Responsible Hungarian Ministry, §§\r\n                   33-34. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 97.]\r\n\r\nThe statement which has sometimes been made that the parliamentary\r\nsystem operates to-day in the kingdom of Hungary in a fuller measure\r\nthan in any other continental country requires qualification.\r\nNominally, it is true, an unfavorable vote in the Deputies upon a\r\nGovernment measure or action involves the retirement of a minister, or\r\nof the entire cabinet, unless the crown is willing to dissolve the\r\nChamber and appeal to the country; and no Government project of\r\nconsequence can be carried through without parliamentary approval.\r\nPractical conditions within the kingdom, however, have never been\r\nfavorable for the operation of parliamentarism in a normal manner. In\r\nthe first place, the parliament itself is in no wise representative of\r\nthe nation as a whole. In the second place, the proceedings of the\r\nbody are not infrequently so stormy in character that for months at a\r\ntime the essential principles of parliamentarism are hopelessly\r\nsubverted. Finally, and most fundamental of all, at no period in the\r\nkingdom's history have there been two great parties, contending on (p. 500)\r\nfairly equal terms for the mastery of the state, each in a position to\r\nassume direction of the government upon the defeat or momentary\r\ndiscomfiture of the other. From 1867 to 1875, as will appear, there\r\nwas but one party (that led by Deák) which accepted the Compromise,\r\nand hence could be intrusted with office; and from 1875 to the present\r\nday there has been but one great party, the Liberal, broken at times\r\ninto groups and beset by more or less influential conservative\r\nelements, but always sufficiently compact and powerful to be able to\r\nretain control of the government. Under these conditions it has worked\r\nout in practice that ministries have retired repeatedly by reason of\r\ndecline of popularity, internal friction, or request of the sovereign,\r\nand but rarely in consequence of an adverse vote in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*552. The Question of the Ausgleich.*--Throughout half a century the\r\nparty history of Hungary has centered about two preponderating\r\nproblems, first, the maintenance of the Compromise with Austria and,\r\nsecond, the preservation of the political ascendancy of the Magyars.\r\nOf these the first has been the more fundamental, because the\r\nascendancy of the Magyars was, and is, an accomplished fact and upon\r\nthe perpetuation of that ascendancy there can be, among the ruling\r\nMagyars themselves, no essential division. The issue upon which those\r\nelements of the population which are vested with political power (and\r\nwhich, consequently, compose the political parties in the true sense)\r\nhave been always most prone to divide, is that of the perpetuation and\r\ncharacter of the Ausgleich. To put it broadly, there have been\r\nregularly two schools of opinion in respect to this subject. There\r\nhave been the men, on the one hand, who accept the arrangements of\r\n1867 and maintain that by virtue of them Hungary, far from having\r\nsurrendered any of her essential interests, has acquired an influence\r\nand prestige which otherwise she could not have enjoyed. And there\r\nhave been those, on the other hand, who see in the Ausgleich nothing\r\nsave an abandonment of national dignity and who, therefore, would have\r\nthe arrangement thoroughly remodelled, or even abrogated outright.\r\nUnder various names, and working by different methods, the parties of\r\nthe kingdom have assumed almost invariably one or the other of these\r\nattitudes.\r\n\r\n*553. Formation of the Liberal Party.*--As has been pointed out, the\r\nCompromise was carried through the Hungarian parliament in 1867 by the\r\nparty of Deák. Opposed to it was the Left, who favored the maintenance\r\nof no union whatsoever with Austria save through the crown. The    (p. 501)\r\nfirst ministry formed under the new arrangement, presided over by\r\nCount Andrássy, was composed of members of the Deák party, and at the\r\nnational elections of 1869 this party obtained a substantial, though\r\nhard-won, majority. In 1871 Andrássy resigned to become the successor\r\nof Count Beust in the joint ministry of foreign affairs at Vienna, and\r\ntwo years later Deák himself, now an aged man, withdrew from active\r\npolitical life. There followed in Hungary an epoch of political\r\nunsettlement during the course of which ministries changed frequently,\r\nfinances fell into disorder, and legislation was scant and haphazard.\r\nThe Deák party disintegrated and, but for the fact that the Left\r\ngradually abandoned its determination to overthrow the Ausgleich, the\r\noutcome might well have been a constitutional crisis, if not war. As\r\nit was, when, in February, 1875, the leader of the Left, Kálman Tisza,\r\npublicly acknowledged his party's conversion to the Austrian\r\naffiliation, the fragments of the Deák party amalgamated readily with\r\nthe Left to form the great Liberal party by which the destinies of\r\nHungary have been guided almost uninterruptedly to the present day.\r\nExcept for the followers of Kossuth, essentially irreconcilable, the\r\nMagyars were now united in the support of some sort of union with\r\nAustria, and most of them were content for the present to abide by the\r\narrangement of 1867. Before the close of 1875 Tisza was established at\r\nthe head of a Liberal cabinet, and from that time until his fall, in\r\nMarch, 1890, he was continuously the real ruler of Hungary.\r\n\r\n*554. The Liberal Ascendancy: Tisza, Szápáry, Wekerle, and Bánffy.*--The\r\nprimary policy of Tisza was to convert the polyglot Hungarian kingdom\r\ninto a centralized and homogeneous Magyar state, and to this end he\r\ndid not hesitate to employ the most relentless and sometimes\r\nunscrupulous means. Nominally a Liberal, he trampled the principles of\r\nliberalism systematically under foot. To the disordered country,\r\nhowever, his strong rule brought no small measure of benefit,\r\nespecially in respect to economic conditions. He supported faithfully\r\nthe Compromise of 1867; but when, in 1877, the commercial treaty\r\nbetween the two halves of the monarchy expired he contrived to procure\r\nincreased advantages for Hungary, and among them the conversion of the\r\nAustrian National Bank into a joint institution of the two states.\r\nOpposition to the Tisza régime arose from two sources principally, i.e.,\r\nthe Kossuth party of Independence, which clung still to the principles\r\nof 1848, and the National party, led by the brilliant orator Count\r\nAlbert Apponyi, distinguishable from the Independence group, on the\r\none hand, by its provisional acquiescence in the Ausgleich and     (p. 502)\r\nfrom the Liberals, on the other, by its still more enthusiastic\r\nadvocacy of Magyarization. At Vienna, Tisza was regarded as\r\nindispensable; but growing discontent in Hungary undermined his\r\nposition and March 13, 1890, he retired from office.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Tisza there was inaugurated a period of short\r\nministries whose history it would be unprofitable to attempt to\r\nrecount in detail. The Liberal party continued in control, for there\r\nhad appeared no rival group of sufficient strength to drive it from\r\npower. But the rise of a series of issues involving the relations of\r\nchurch and state injected into the political situation a number of new\r\nelements and occasioned frequent readjustments within the ministerial\r\ngroup. The ministry of Count Szápáry, which succeeded that of Tisza\r\nwas followed, November 21, 1892, by that of Dr. Sandor Wekerle, and\r\nit, in turn, after a number of the religious bills had been passed,\r\nwas succeeded, January 11, 1895, by a cabinet presided over by Baron\r\nBánffy. At the elections of 1896 the Liberals were overwhelmingly\r\ntriumphant, acquiring in the lower chamber a majority of two to one.\r\nThe Nationalist contingent was reduced from 57 to 35.\r\n\r\n*555. The Era of Parliamentary Obstructionism.*--The period covered by\r\nthe Bánffy ministry (January, 1895, to February, 1899) was one of the\r\nstormiest in Hungarian parliamentary history. At the close of 1897 the\r\ndecennial economic agreement with Austria came automatically to an\r\nend, and despite its best efforts the Government was unable to procure\r\nfrom Parliament an approval of a renewal of the arrangement. Through\r\ntwo years successively the existing agreement was extended\r\nprovisionally for twelve months at a time. It was only during the\r\nministry of Széll, who took office in February, 1899, that a renewal\r\nwas voted, covering the period to 1907. In Hungary there is no\r\nconstitutional provision equivalent to Section 14 of the constitution\r\nof Austria, but during 1897-1899 the utter breakdown of legislation at\r\nBudapest drove Premier Bánffy to a policy of government by decree very\r\nsimilar to that which was at the same time being employed at Vienna.\r\nThe Government had all of the while a substantial majority, but the\r\nobstructionist tactics of the Independence group, the Apponyi\r\nNationalists, and the Clericals were of such a nature that normal\r\nlegislation was impossible. Under the régime of Széll (February, 1899,\r\nto May, 1903), who was a survivor of the old Deák group,\r\nconstitutionalism was rehabilitated and the Liberals who had been\r\nalienated by Bánffy's autocratic measures were won back to the\r\nGovernment's support. Nationalist obstruction likewise diminished, for\r\nthe primary object of Apponyi's followers had been to drive Bánffy\r\nfrom power.\r\n\r\nThe brief ministry of Count Khuen-Hedérváry (May 1 to September    (p. 503)\r\n29, 1903) was followed by a ministry presided over by Count István\r\n[Stephen] Tisza, son of Kálman Tisza, premier from 1875 to 1890. The\r\nprincipal task of the younger Tisza's ministry was to effect an\r\narrangement whereby the Hungarian army, while remaining essentially\r\nHungarian, should not be impaired in efficiency as a part of the dual\r\nmonarchy's military establishment. During parliamentary consideration\r\nof this subject obstruction to the Government's proposals acquired\r\nagain such force that, under the accustomed rules of procedure, no\r\naction could be taken. November 18, 1904, the opposition shouted down\r\na Modification of the Standing Orders bill, designed to frustrate\r\nobstruction, and would permit no debate upon it; whereupon, the\r\npresident of the Chamber declared the bill carried and adjourned the\r\nhouse until December 13, and subsequently until January 5, 1905. The\r\nopposition commanded now 190 votes in a total of 451. When the date\r\nfor the reassembling arrived members of the obstructionist groups\r\nbroke into the parliament house and by demolishing the furniture\r\nrendered a session for the time impossible. In disgust Tisza appealed\r\nto the country, only to be signally defeated. The Government carried\r\nbut 152 seats. The Kossuth party of Independence alone carried 163;\r\nthe Liberal dissenters under Andrássy got 23; the Clerical People's\r\nparty, 23; the Bánffy group, 11; and the non-Magyar nationalities, 8.\r\nTisza sought to retire, but not until June 17, 1905, would the\r\nsovereign accept his resignation.\r\n\r\n*556. The Government's Partial Triumph.*--Incensed by the prolonged, and\r\nin many respects indefensible, character of the parliamentary\r\ndeadlock, Francis Joseph resolved to establish in office an\r\nessentially extra-constitutional ministry which should somehow\r\ncontrive to override the opposition, and likewise to set on foot a\r\nmovement looking toward the revolutionizing of Hungarian parliamentary\r\nconditions by the introduction of manhood suffrage. Under the ministry\r\nof Baron Fejérváry, constituted June 21, 1905, there was inaugurated a\r\nperiod of frankly arbitrary government. Parliament was prorogued\r\nrepeatedly, and by censorship of the press, the dragooning of towns,\r\nand the dismissal of officers the Magyar population was made to feel\r\nunmistakably the weight of the royal displeasure. For awhile there was\r\ndogged resistance, but in time the threat of electoral reform took the\r\nheart out of the opposition. Outwardly a show of resistance was\r\nmaintained, but after the early months of 1906 the Government may be\r\nsaid once more to have had the situation well in hand. Two events of\r\nthe year mentioned imparted emphasis to the profound change of\r\npolitical conditions which the period of conflict had produced. The\r\nfirst was the establishment, under the premiership of the Liberal  (p. 504)\r\nleader Dr. Wekerle, of a coalition cabinet embracing a veritable\r\ngalaxy of Hungarian statesmen, including Francis Kossuth, Count\r\nAndrássy, and Count Apponyi. The second was the all but complete\r\nannihilation, at the national elections which ensued, of the old\r\nLiberal party, and the substitution for it, in the rôle of political\r\npreponderance, of the Kossuth party of Independence. The number of\r\nseats carried by this rapidly developing party was 250, or more than\r\none-half of the entire number in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n*557. The Parliamentary Conflict Renewed.*--The Wekerle cabinet entered\r\noffice pledged to electoral reform, although in the subject it in\r\nreality cherished but meager interest. In 1908, as has been related,\r\nit was impelled by popular pressure to submit a new electoral\r\nscheme;[705] but that scheme was conceived wholly in the Magyar\r\ninterest and did not touch the real problem. It very properly failed\r\nof adoption. Meanwhile the ministry fell into hopeless disagreement\r\nupon the question of whether Hungary should consent to the renewal of\r\nthe charter of the Austro-Hungarian Bank (to expire December 31, 1910)\r\nor should hold out for the establishment of a separate Hungarian Bank,\r\nand, April 27, 1909, Premier Wekerle tendered his resignation. At the\r\nsolicitation of the sovereign he consented to retain office until a\r\nnew ministry could be constituted, which, in point of fact, proved to\r\nbe until January 17, 1910. Added to the problem of the Bank was an\r\neven more vexatious one, that, namely, of the Magyarization of the\r\nHungarian regiments. The extremer demands in the matter of\r\nMagyarization emanated, of course, from the Independence party, though\r\nupon the issue the party itself became divided into two factions, the\r\nextremists being led by Justh and the more moderate element by\r\nKossuth. The coalition was disrupted utterly; the Wekerle ministry\r\ndragged on simply because through many months no other could be\r\nbrought together to take its place. The year 1909 passed without even\r\nthe vote of a budget.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 705: See p. 495.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1910, Count Hedérváry succeeded in forming a cabinet, and\r\nthere ensued a lull in the political struggle. At the elections of\r\nJune, the Government--representing virtually the revived Liberal\r\nparty--carried 246 seats, while the two wings of the Independence\r\nparty secured together only 85. The Clericals were reduced to 13 and\r\nthe non-Magyars to 7. Under the leadership of István Tisza there was\r\norganized, at the beginning of 1910, a so-called \"National Party of\r\nWork,\" which by the emphasis which it laid upon its purpose of\r\npractical achievement commended itself to large elements of the\r\nnation. By the Hedérváry government it was announced that the      (p. 505)\r\nfranchise would be reformed in such a manner as to maintain, without\r\nthe employment of the plural vote, the historical character of the\r\nMagyar state; but the bitterness of Magyar feeling upon the subject\r\ncontinued to preclude all possibility of action. The embarrassments\r\ncontinually suffered by the Hedérváry ministry reached their\r\nculmination in the winter of 1911-1912, at which time the relations\r\nbetween Austria and Hungary became so strained that Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph threatened to abdicate unless pending difficulties should be\r\nadjusted. The question of most immediate seriousness pertained to the\r\nadoption of new regulations for the military establishment, but the\r\nelectoral issue loomed large in the background. The retirement of the\r\nHedérváry cabinet, March 7, 1912, and the accession of a ministry\r\npresided over by Dr. de Lukacs affected the situation but slightly.\r\nThe new premier made it clear that he would labor for electoral\r\nreform, and issue was joined with him squarely upon this part of his\r\nprogramme by the aristocracy, the gentry, the Chamber of Magnates, and\r\nall the adherents of Andrássy, Apponyi, and Kossuth, with the\r\ndeliberately conceived purpose of frightening the Government, and\r\nespecially the Emperor-King, into an abandonment of all plans to\r\ntamper with existing electoral arrangements. During the earlier months\r\nof the ministry efforts of the premier to effect a working agreement\r\nwith the forces of opposition were but indifferently successful.[706]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 706: For a brief account of Hungarian\r\n                   party politics to 1896 see Lowell, Governments and\r\n                   Parties, II., 152-161. For references to current\r\n                   periodicals see p. 497.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*558. Law and Justice.*--The law of Hungary, like that of England, is\r\nthe product of long-continued growth. It consists fundamentally of the\r\ncommon law of the mediæval period (first codified by the jurist\r\nVerböczy in the sixteenth century), amplified and modernized in more\r\nrecent times, especially since the reforms of 1867, so that what\r\noriginally was little more than a body of feudal customs has been\r\ntransformed into a comprehensive national code. Hungarian criminal\r\nlaw, codified in 1878, is recognized to be the equal of anything of\r\nthe kind that the world possesses. Since 1896 there has been in\r\nprogress a codification of the civil law, and the task is announced to\r\nbe approaching completion. There are numerous special codes,\r\npertaining to commerce, bankruptcy, and industry, whose promulgation\r\nfrom time to time has marked epochs in the economic development of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe lower Hungarian tribunals, or courts of first instance, comprise\r\n458 county courts, with single judges, and 76 district courts,     (p. 506)\r\nwith two or more judges each. Both exercise jurisdiction in civil and\r\ncriminal cases; but the jurisdiction of the county courts in civil\r\ncases extends only to suits involving not more than 1,200 crowns,\r\nwhile in criminal cases these tribunals are not competent to impose\r\npunishment exceeding a single year's imprisonment. The district courts\r\nserve as courts of appeal from the county courts. Of superior courts\r\nthere are fourteen--twelve \"royal tables,\" or courts of appeal, a\r\nSupreme Court of Justice at Agram, and a Royal Supreme Court at\r\nBudapest. The twelve contain, in all, 200 judges; the Royal Supreme\r\nCourt contains 92. All judges are appointed by the king. Once\r\nappointed, they are independent and irremovable. Only Hungarian\r\ncitizens may be appointed, and every appointee must have attained the\r\nage of twenty-six, must be of good moral character, must be familiar\r\nwith the language of the court in which he is to serve, and must have\r\npassed the requisite legal examinations. Salaries vary from 3,840 to\r\n10,000 crowns. Supreme administrative control of the judicial system\r\nis vested in the Minister of Justice. The sphere of his authority is\r\nregulated minutely by parliamentary statute. In the main, he\r\nsupervises the judges, attends to the legal aspects of international\r\nrelations, prepares bills, and oversees the execution of sentences.\r\n\r\n*559. Local Government: the County.*--The principal unit of local\r\ngovernment in Hungary is the county. The original Hungarian county\r\ninstituted by St. Stephen about the year 1000, was simply a district,\r\nclosely resembling the English county or the French department, at the\r\nhead of which the king placed an officer to represent the crown in\r\nmilitary and administrative affairs. Local self-government had its\r\nbeginning in the opposition of the minor nobility to this centralizing\r\nagency, and in periods of royal weakness the nobles usurped a certain\r\namount of control, first in justice, later in legislation, and finally\r\nin the election of local officials, which in time was extended legal\r\nrecognition. At all points the county became substantially autonomous.\r\nIndeed, by 1848 Hungary was really a confederation of fifty-two\r\ncounties, each not far removed from an aristocratic republic, rather\r\nthan a centralized state. For a time after 1867 there was a tendency\r\ntoward a revival of the centralization of earlier days. In 1876 laws\r\nwere enacted which vested the administration of the county in a\r\ncommittee composed in part of members elected within the county, but\r\nalso in part of officials designated by the crown; and a statute of\r\n1891 went still further in the direction of bureaucratic\r\ncentralization. More recently, however, the county has undergone a\r\nslight measure of democratization.\r\n\r\nExclusive of Croatia-Slavonia, there are in Hungary to-day 63      (p. 507)\r\nrural counties and 36 urban counties or towns with municipal rights.\r\nIn Croatia-Slavonia the numbers are 8 and 4 respectively. The urban\r\ncounties are in reality municipalities and are essentially separate\r\nfrom the rural counties in which they are situated. The governmental\r\nsystem of the county comprises a council of twenty, composed half of\r\nmembers chosen by the electors for six years and half of persons who\r\npay the highest taxes, together with an especially appointed committee\r\nwhich serves as the local executive. At the head of the assembly is\r\nthe _föispán_, or lord lieutenant, appointed by the crown. Legally,\r\nthe counties may withhold taxes and refuse to furnish troops, but\r\nthere is no popular representation in the true sense in the county\r\ngovernments. The franchise is confined to the very restricted\r\nparliamentary electorate. The subject races and the working classes\r\nare unrepresented and the real possessors of power are the Magyar\r\nlandowners.\r\n\r\n*560. Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia.*--To the kingdom of Hungary\r\nproper are attached certain _partes adnexæ_ which enjoy a large\r\nmeasure of political autonomy. Dalmatia, united to Hungary at the\r\nbeginning of the twelfth century, belongs _de jure_ to Hungary and _de\r\nfacto_ to Austria; Croatia and Slavonia belong both _de jure_ and _de\r\nfacto_ to Hungary.[707] Croatia and Slavonia, as Hungarian dominions,\r\nhave always possessed a peculiar status. They are inalienable portions\r\nof the kingdom, and in all that pertains to war, trade, and finance\r\nthey are on precisely the same footing as any other part of the state.\r\nIn other matters, however, i.e., in religion, education, justice, and\r\nhome affairs generally, they enjoy a wide range of independent control.\r\nThe administration of common affairs is vested in the Hungarian\r\nministry, which must always contain a minister with the special\r\nfunction of supervision of Croatian interests. In the parliament at\r\nBudapest Croatia-Slavonia is represented by 40 members (sent from its\r\nown diet) in the Chamber of Deputies and three members in the Chamber\r\nof Magnates. These arrangements exist in virtue originally of an\r\nagreement concluded between the Magyars and the Croats in 1868, and\r\nthey are closely analogous to the relationships established by the\r\nCompromise of the previous year between Hungary and Austria. The\r\ncompact of 1868 was renewed upon several occasions prior to 1898,  (p. 508)\r\nsince which time it has been intermittently under process of revision.\r\nAmong the Croats there has long been insistent demand for its\r\nfundamental modification. The charge, in general, is that as at\r\npresent administered the arrangement operates all but exclusively to\r\nthe benefit of the Hungarians.[708] The Wekerle coalition ministry of\r\n1906 promised a redress of grievances, but none was forthcoming, and\r\nin more recent years, especially 1907-1908, riots and other\r\nanti-Magyar demonstrations have been not uncommon in the territories.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 707: Until 1848 the grand-principality of\r\n                   Transylvania also enjoyed a considerable measure of\r\n                   autonomy. In 1848 it was united with Hungary. In\r\n                   1849 it regained its ancient independence, but in\r\n                   1867 it was again joined with Hungary. By\r\n                   legislation of 1868 and 1876 it was fully\r\n                   incorporated in the kingdom, 75 seats being awarded\r\n                   it in the Chamber of Deputies at Budapest in lieu\r\n                   of its provincial diet, which was abolished.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 708: Under the agreement 44 per cent of\r\n                   the Croatian-Slavonian revenue is retained for\r\n                   local needs and the remaining 56 per cent is\r\n                   devoted to common expenditures of the kingdom upon\r\n                   the army, public works, and the national debt. It\r\n                   is alleged, among other things, that this\r\n                   apportionment is unjust, and, furthermore, that the\r\n                   Hungarian authorities systematically divert local\r\n                   funds to national uses.]\r\n\r\nThe local Croatian-Slavonian diet is a unicameral body consisting of\r\n90 deputies elected by districts, and of dignitaries (ecclesiastics,\r\nprefects of counties, princes, counts, and barons) to the number of\r\nnot more than half of the quota of elected members. The executive\r\nconsists of the three departments of Interior and Finance, Culture and\r\nEducation, and Justice. At the head of each is a chief, and over them\r\nall presides an official known as the _Banus_. The _Banus_ is\r\nappointed by the crown on the nomination of the premier. He is\r\n_ex-officio_ a member of the Chamber of Magnates, and it is his\r\nfunction to supervise all matters of administration in the provinces,\r\nunder the general direction of the Croatian minister, who constitutes\r\nthe vital tie between the central government at Budapest and the\r\ndependent territories. Local government is administered in eight rural\r\nand four urban counties.[709]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 709: An English version of the statute of\r\n                   1868 regulating the status of Croatia-Slavonia is\r\n                   printed in Drage, Austria-Hungary, 767-783.

The Ausgleich.*--The unique political relation which subsists\r\nto-day between the Empire of Austria and the kingdom of Hungary rests\r\nupon the Ausgleich, or Compromise, of 1867, supplemented at certain\r\npoints by agreements of more recent date. The fundamental terms of the\r\narrangement, worked out by the Emperor Francis Joseph, Deák, and Baron\r\nBeust, were incorporated in essentially identical statutes enacted by\r\nthe Hungarian Parliament and the Austrian Reichsrath December 21 and\r\n24 of the year mentioned. Between the demand of Hungary, on the one\r\nhand, for independence (save only in respect to the crown), and that\r\nof Austria, on the other, for the thoroughgoing subordination of the\r\nHungarian to an Imperial ministry, there was devised a compromise\r\nwhose ruling principle is that of dualism rather than that of either\r\nabsolute unity or subordination. Under the name Austria-Hungary there\r\nwas established a novel type of state consisting of an empire and a\r\nkingdom, each of which, retaining its identity unimpaired, stands in\r\nlaw upon a plane of complete equality with the other. Each has its own\r\nconstitution, its own parliament, its own ministry, its own\r\nadministration, its own courts. Yet the two have but one sovereign and\r\none flag, and within certain large and important fields the\r\ngovernmental machinery and public policy of the two are maintained in\r\ncommon. The laws which comprise the basis of the arrangement are the\r\nproduct of international compact. They provide no means by which they\r\nmay be amended, and they can be amended only in the manner in which\r\nthey were adopted, i.e., by international agreement supplemented by\r\nreciprocal parliamentary enactment.[710]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 710: Drage, Austria-Hungary.

THE COMMON ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT                                 (p. 510)\r\n\r\n*562. The Emperor-King.*--Of organs of government which the two\r\ndominions possess in common, and by which they are effectually tied\r\ntogether administratively, there are three: (1) the monarch; (2) the\r\nministries of Foreign Affairs, War, and Finance; and (3) the\r\nDelegations. The functions and prerogatives of the monarch are\r\nthree-fold, i.e., those which he possesses as emperor of Austria,\r\nthose which belong to him as king of Hungary, and those vested in him\r\nas head of the Austro-Hungarian union. In theory, and largely in\r\npractice, the three sets of relationships are clearly distinguished.\r\nAll, however, must be combined in the same individual. The law of\r\nsuccession is the same, and it would not be possible for Francis\r\nJoseph, for example, to vacate the kingship of Hungary while retaining\r\nthe Imperial office in the co-ordinated state. But there is a\r\ncoronation at Vienna and another at Budapest; the royal title reads\r\n\"Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia, etc., and Apostolic King of\r\nHungary\"; and the relations of the sovereign with each of the two\r\ngovernments are most of the time conducted precisely as if the other\r\nof the two were non-existent. In the capacity of dual sovereign the\r\nmonarch's principal functions comprise the command of the army and\r\nnavy,[711] the appointment of heads of the joint ministries, the\r\npromulgation of ordinances applying to the states in common, and the\r\ngiving of assent to measures enacted by the dual legislative body.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 711: As an illustration of the\r\n                   sensitiveness of the Hungarians in the matter of\r\n                   their Austrian relations the fact may be cited that\r\n                   in 1889, after prolonged effort, an arrangement was\r\n                   procured in accordance with which the joint\r\n                   sovereign, in the capacity of commander of the\r\n                   armed forces, is known as Emperor _and_ King, not\r\n                   as Emperor-King.]\r\n\r\n*563. The Joint Ministries.*--By the Compromise of 1867 the three\r\ndepartments of administration which most obviously require\r\nconcentration and uniformity were established upon a basis of\r\ncommunity between the two governmental systems. The first of these is\r\nthe ministry of Foreign Affairs. Neither Austria nor Hungary as such\r\nmaintains diplomatic intercourse with other powers; Under the\r\ndirection of the Foreign Minister (known, until 1871, as the Imperial\r\nChancellor) are maintained all relations with foreign governments,\r\nthrough a diplomatic and consular service which represents in every\r\nrespect the monarchy as a whole. Commercial treaties, and treaties (p. 511)\r\nstipulating changes of territory or imposing burdens upon the state or\r\nupon any part of it, require the assent of both the parliament at\r\nVienna and that at Budapest.\r\n\r\nThe second common ministry is that of War. With respect to military\r\nand naval administration there has been no little misunderstanding,\r\nand even ill-feeling, between the two states. The instruments of 1867\r\nvest the supreme command of the army and navy in the joint monarch,\r\nyet the armed establishments of the states are maintained on the basis\r\nof separate, even if approximately identical, laws, and each is placed\r\nunder the immediate supervision of a separate minister of national\r\ndefence. Each country maintains its independent arrangements for the\r\nraising of the yearly contingent of recruits. It is only after the\r\nquotas have been raised that the dual monarch can exercise his power\r\nof appointing officers and regulating the organization of the forces.\r\nThe authority of the joint war minister is confined largely to matters\r\nof secondary importance, such as equipment and the commissariat. Only\r\na close understanding between the ministries at Vienna and Budapest\r\ncan be depended upon, in the last analysis, to avert an utter\r\nbreakdown of the admittedly precarious military establishment.[712]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 712: V. Duruy, L'Armée austro-hongroise,\r\n                   in _Revue de Paris_, Jan. 15, 1909; M. B., L'Armée\r\n                   autrichienne, in _Annales des Sciences Politiques_,\r\n                   May, 1909; Com.

Each of the two states\r\nmaintains an independent finance ministry and carries its own budget,\r\nbecause, within certain limitations, the administration of fiscal\r\nmatters is left to the states in their separate capacities; but\r\nquestions of joint expenditure, the establishment of the joint budget,\r\nand the examination of accounts are committed to a common ministry at\r\nVienna. The powers of the joint minister of finance are, in point of\r\nfact, limited. Like the other joint ministers, he may not be a member\r\nof either the Austrian or the Hungarian cabinet, nor may he have\r\naccess to the separate parliaments. His function is essentially that\r\nof a cashier. He receives the contributions made by the two states to\r\nthe common expenses and hands them over to the several departments.\r\nUntil the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1908, it devolved\r\nupon him, by special arrangement, to administer the affairs of these\r\nsemi-dependent territories.\r\n\r\n*564. Fiscal and Economic Arrangements.*--In 1867 it was agreed that the\r\ncommon expenditures of Austria and Hungary should be met, in so    (p. 512)\r\nfar as possible, from the joint revenues, especially the customs,\r\nand that all common outlays in excess of these revenues should be\r\nborne by the states in a proportion to be fixed at decennial intervals\r\nby the Reichsrath and the Hungarian Parliament. Other joint interests\r\nof an economic nature--trade, customs, the debt, and railway\r\npolicy--were left likewise to be readjusted at ten-year intervals. In\r\nrespect to contributions, the arrangement hit upon originally was that\r\nall common deficits should be made up by quotas proportioned to the\r\ntax returns of the two countries, namely, Austria 70 per cent and\r\nHungary 30 per cent. As has been pointed out, the periodic overhauling\r\nof the economic relationships of the two states has been productive of\r\nfrequent and disastrous controversy. The task was accomplished\r\nsuccessfully in the law of June 27, 1878, and again in that of May 21,\r\n1887. But the readjustment due in 1897 had the curious fortune not to\r\nbe completed until the year in which another readjustment was due, i.e.,\r\n1907. To the parliamentary contests, at both Vienna and Budapest,\r\nby which the decade 1897--1907 was filled some allusion has been\r\nmade.[713] They involved distinctly the most critical test of\r\nstability to which the Ausgleich has been subjected since its\r\nestablishment. During the period various features of the pre-existing\r\narrangements were continued in force by royal decree or by provisional\r\nparliamentary vote, but not until October, 1907, were the economic\r\nrelation of the two states put once more upon a normal basis.\r\nThroughout the decade the Emperor-King exercised repeatedly the\r\nauthority with which he is invested by law of 1867 to fix the ratio of\r\ncontributions for one year at a time, when action cannot be had on the\r\npart of the legislative bodies. The ratio prevailing during the period\r\nwas Austria 66-46/49 per cent and Hungary 33-3/49 per cent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 713: See pp. 479-481, 502-504.]\r\n\r\nBy the agreement of 1907, concluded for the usual ten-year period, the\r\nHungarian quota was raised from the figure mentioned to 36.4 per cent.\r\nThe customs alliance, established in 1867 and renewed in 1878 and\r\n1887, was superseded by a customs and commercial treaty, in accordance\r\nwith which each state maintains what is technically a separate customs\r\nsystem, although until the expiration of existing conventions with\r\nforeign powers in 1917 the tariff arrangements of the two states must\r\nremain identical. Under the conditions which have arisen the customs\r\nunity of the monarchy is likely to be disrupted in fact, as already it\r\nis in law, upon the advent of the year mentioned. Thereafter\r\ncommercial treaties with foreign nations will be negotiated in the\r\nname of the two states concurrently and will be signed, not merely by\r\nthe common minister of foreign affairs, but also by a special      (p. 513)\r\nAustrian and a special Hungarian representative.[714]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 714: L. Louis-Jaray, Les relations\r\n                   austro-hongroises et le nouveau compromis\r\n                   économique, in _Questions Diplomatiques et\r\n                   Coloniales_, Jan. 16 and Feb. 1, 1908; and Les\r\n                   dispositions économiques du nouveau compromis\r\n                   austro-hongrois, in _Revue Économique\r\n                   Internationale_, March, 1908.]\r\n\r\n*565. The Delegations: Organization and Sessions.*--All legislative\r\npower of the Reichsrath and of the Hungarian Parliament, in so far as\r\nit relates to the joint affairs of the states, is exercised by two\r\n\"delegations,\" one representing each of the two parliaments. The\r\nAustrian Delegation consists of sixty members, twenty of whom are\r\nchosen by the Herrenhaus from its own members, and the other forty of\r\nwhom are elected by the Abgeordnetenhaus in such manner that the\r\ndeputies from each province designate a number of delegates allotted\r\nto them by law. The Hungarian Delegation consists likewise of sixty\r\nmembers, twenty elected by and from the upper, forty by and from the\r\nlower, chamber, with the further requirement that there shall be\r\nincluded four of the Croatian members of the Chamber of Deputies and\r\none of the Croatians in the Chamber of Magnates. All members of both\r\nDelegations are elected annually and may be re-elected. They must be\r\nconvoked by the Emperor-King at least once a year. Every device is\r\nemployed to lay emphasis upon the absolute equality of the two\r\nDelegations, and of the states they represent, even to the extent of\r\nhaving the sessions held alternately in Vienna and Budapest. The two\r\nbodies meet in separate chambers, each under a president whom it\r\nelects, but the proposals of the Government are laid before both at\r\nthe same time by the joint ministry. In the Austrian Delegation all\r\nproceedings are conducted in the German tongue; in the Hungarian, in\r\nMagyar; and all communications between the two are couched in both\r\nlanguages. Sittings, as a rule, are public. In the event of a failure\r\nto agree after a third exchange of communications there may be, upon\r\ndemand of either Delegation, a joint session. Upon this occasion there\r\nis no debate, but merely the taking of a vote, in which there must\r\nparticipate an absolutely equal number of members of the two\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n*566. The Delegations: Powers.*--The members of the common ministry have\r\nthe right to share in all deliberations of the Delegations and to\r\npresent their projects personally or through deputies. They must be\r\nheard whenever they desire. Each Delegation, on the other hand, has a\r\nright to address questions to the joint ministry, or to any one of its\r\nmembers, and to require answers and explanations. By concurrent vote\r\nof the two bodies a joint minister may be impeached. In such a     (p. 514)\r\ncase the judges consist of twenty-four independent and legally trained\r\ncitizens representing equally the two countries, chosen by the\r\nDelegations, but not members thereof. The power is one very unlikely\r\nto be exercised; in truth, the responsibility of the ministers to the\r\nDelegations is more theoretical than actual.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Delegations are severely restricted. They extend\r\nin no case beyond the common affairs of the two states; and they\r\ncomprise little more than the voting of supplies asked by the\r\nGovernment and a certain supervision of the common administrative\r\nmachinery. Of legislative power, in the proper sense, the two bodies\r\npossess virtually none. Practically all law in the dual monarchy takes\r\nthe form of statutes enacted concurrently by the separate parliaments\r\nof Austria and Hungary. The system is not ideal. It involves delay,\r\nconfusion, and an excess of partisan wrangling. Probably upon no other\r\nbasis, however, would even the semblance of an Austro-Hungarian union\r\nbe possible. The existing arrangement operates somewhat to the\r\nadvantage of Hungary, because the Hungarian Delegation is a body which\r\nvotes solidly together, whereas the Austrian is composed of mutually\r\nhostile racial and political groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE TERRITORIES OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\r\n\r\n*567. Annexation of the Provinces, 1908.*--By the Congress of Berlin, in\r\n1878, Austria was authorized, ostensibly in the interest of the peace\r\nof Europe, to occupy and administer the neighboring provinces of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina; and from that date until 1908, although the\r\nprovinces continued under the nominal sovereignty of the Sultan of\r\nTurkey, their affairs were managed regularly by the Austro-Hungarian\r\nminister of finance. The eventual absorption of the territories by the\r\ndual monarchy was not unexpected, but it came in virtue of a _coup_ by\r\nwhich the European world was thrown for a time into some agitation.\r\nThe revolution at Constantinople during the summer of 1908,\r\naccompanied by the threatened dissolution of European Turkey, created\r\nprecisely the opportunity for which the authorities at Vienna had long\r\nwaited. October 5, Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria proclaimed the\r\ncomplete separation of Bulgaria from the Sultan's dominions and\r\nassumed the title of king. Two days later Emperor Francis Joseph\r\nproclaimed to the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina the immediate\r\nextension of Austro-Hungarian sovereignty over them, alleging that the\r\nhour had arrived when they ought to be raised to a higher political\r\nlevel and accorded the benefits of Austro-Hungarian constitutionalism.\r\nAmong the population of the annexed provinces the Roman Catholic   (p. 515)\r\nelement approved the union, but the Greek Orthodox and Mohammedan\r\nmajority warmly opposed it. The people of the provinces are Servian in\r\nrace, and in the interest of the Servian union which it was hoped at\r\nsome time to bring about Servia and Montenegro protested loudly, and\r\neven began preparations for war. The annexation constituted a flagrant\r\ninfraction of the Berlin Treaty, and during some weeks the danger of\r\ninternational complications was grave. Eventually, however, on the\r\nunderstanding that the new possessor should render to Turkey certain\r\nfinancial compensation, the various powers more or less grudgingly\r\nyielded their assent to the change of status.\r\n\r\n*568. The Constitution of 1910: the Diet.* At the time of the annexation\r\nit was promised that the provinces should be granted a constitution.\r\nThe pledge was fulfilled in the fundamental laws which were\r\npromulgated by the Vienna Government February 22, 1910. The\r\nconstitution proper consists of a preamble and three sections, of\r\nwhich the first relates to civil rights, the second to the composition\r\nof the Diet, and the third to the competence of the Diet. Under the\r\nterms of the preamble the pre-existing military and administrative\r\narrangements are perpetuated. The civil rights section extends to the\r\nannexed provinces the principal provisions of the Austrian\r\nconstitution in respect to equality before the law, freedom of\r\npersonal movement, the protection of individual liberty, the\r\nindependence of judges, freedom of conscience, autonomy of recognized\r\nreligious communities, the right of free expression of opinion, the\r\nabolition of restrictive censorship, the freedom of scientific\r\ninvestigation, secrecy of postal and telegraphic communications, and\r\nthe rights of association and public meeting.\r\n\r\nThe second section creates a diet of seventy-two elected and twenty\r\n_ex-officio_ representatives, fifteen of the latter being dignitaries\r\nof the Mohammedan, Servian, Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic\r\nreligious communities. The presidential bureau, consisting of one\r\npresident and two vice-presidents, is appointed annually by the crown\r\nat the opening of the session. Each creed is regularly to be\r\nrepresented in the bureau, the presidential office being held by a\r\nServian, a Mohammedan, and a Croat in annual rotation. To be valid,\r\nthe decisions of the Diet require the presence of a majority of the\r\nmembers, except when ecclesiastical matters are under discussion. Upon\r\nsuch occasions the presence of four-fifths of the Diet, and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority, is required.\r\n\r\nThe third section excludes from the legislative competence of the Diet\r\nall joint Austro-Hungarian affairs and questions pertaining to the\r\narmed forces and to customs arrangements. The Diet is, however,    (p. 516)\r\nempowered to elect a national council of nine members and to\r\ncommission it to lay the views of the Diet before the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment. In all other matters, such as civil, penal, police and\r\ncommercial law, industrial and agrarian legislation, sanitation,\r\ncommunications, taxation, the provincial estimates, the issue and\r\nconversion of loans, and the sale or mortgaging of provincial\r\nproperty, the Diet has a free hand. Government measures to be\r\nsubmitted to the Diet require, however, the previous sanction of the\r\nAustrian and the Hungarian cabinets, whose assent is also necessary\r\nbefore bills passed by the Diet can receive the sanction of the crown.\r\n\r\n*569. The Electoral System.*--Subsequent statutes regulate the franchise\r\nand electoral procedure. First of all, the seventy-two elective seats\r\nin the Diet are divided among the adherents of the various religious\r\ndenominations, the Servians receiving 31, the Mohammedans 24, and the\r\nCatholic Croats 16. One seat is reserved for a representative of the\r\nJews. The seats are divided, furthermore, into three curiæ, or\r\nelectoral classes, eighteen being allotted to a first class composed\r\nof large landed proprietors and the heaviest taxpayers, twenty to a\r\nsecond class composed of urban electors, and thirty-four to a third\r\nclass composed of rural electors. The franchise is bestowed upon all\r\nsubjects of the crown, born in the provinces or possessing one year's\r\nresidential qualification, who are of the male sex and have completed\r\ntheir twenty-fourth year. In the first of the three classes women\r\npossess the franchise, although they may exercise it only by male\r\ndeputy. Candidates for election must have completed their thirtieth\r\nyear and must be of the male sex and in full enjoyment of civil\r\nrights. Civil and railway servants, as well as public school teachers,\r\nare not eligible. In the first and second classes votes are recorded\r\nin writing, but in the third, or rural, class, voting, by reason of\r\nthe large proportion of illiterates, is oral. In the second and third\r\n(urban and rural) classes the system of single-member constituencies\r\nhas been adopted. The provinces are divided into as many Servian,\r\nMohammedan, and Catholic constituencies, with separate registers, as\r\nthere are seats allotted to the respective creeds. For the Jews all\r\nthe towns of the two provinces form a single constituency.[715]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 715: The texts of the organic acts of\r\n                   1910 are printed in K.

A CENTURY OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nGeographical juxtaposition, combined with historical circumstance, has\r\ndetermined that between the two modern kingdoms of Holland and\r\nBelgium, widely as they differ in many fundamental characteristics,\r\nrelations should be continuous and close. Both nations have sprung\r\nfrom groups of provinces comprised within the original Low Countries,\r\nor Netherlands. Following the memorable contest of the Dutch with\r\nPhilip II. of Spain, the seven provinces to the north achieved their\r\nindependence at the beginning of the seventeenth century and, under\r\nthe name of the United Provinces, built up a system of government,\r\nrepublican in form though in operation much of the time really\r\nautocratic, which survived through more than two hundred years. The\r\nten provinces to the south continued under the sovereignty of Spain\r\nuntil 1713, when by the Treaty of Utrecht they were transferred to\r\nAustria. They did not attain the status of independent nationality\r\nuntil 1831.\r\n\r\n*570. The French Domination, 1793-1814.*--The constitutional\r\narrangements operative in the Holland and Belgium of to-day are to be\r\nregarded as products largely of the era of the French Revolution and\r\nof the Napoleonic domination. Between 1795 and 1810 both groups of Low\r\nCountry provinces were absorbed by France, and both were forced quite\r\nout of their accustomed political channels. The provinces comprising\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands were overrun by a French army early in 1793.\r\nBy decree of October 1, 1795, they were incorporated in the French\r\nRepublic, being erected into nine departments; and by the Treaty of\r\nLunéville, February 9, 1801, they were definitely ceded by Austria to\r\nFrance.[716] February 1, 1793, the French Republic declared war upon\r\nHolland. During the winter of 1794--1795 the Dutch provinces were  (p. 518)\r\noccupied, and by the Treaty of The Hague, May 16, 1795, they were\r\nerected into a new nationality known as the Batavian Republic, under\r\nthe protection of France.[717] The constitution of the old republic\r\nwas thoroughly overhauled and the stadtholderate, long in the\r\npossession of the house of Orange, was abolished. To the considerable\r\nbody of anti-Orange republicans the coming of the French was, indeed,\r\nnot unwelcome. May 24, 1806, the Batavian Republic was converted by\r\nNapoleon into the kingdom of Holland, and Louis Bonaparte, younger\r\nbrother of the French Emperor, was set up as the unwilling sovereign\r\nof an unwilling people. Nominally, the new kingdom was both\r\nconstitutional and independent; practically, it was an autocracy and a\r\ndependency of France. King Louis labored conscientiously to safeguard\r\nthe interests of his Dutch subjects, but in vain. After four years he\r\nabdicated, under pressure; whereupon, July 9, 1810, an Imperial edict\r\nswept away what remained of the independent status of the Dutch people\r\nand incorporated the kingdom absolutely with France. The ancient\r\nprovinces were replaced by seven departments; to the Dutch were\r\nassigned six seats in the French Senate, three in the Council of\r\nState, and twenty-five in the Legislative Body; a lieutenant-general\r\nwas established at the head of the administrative system; and no\r\neffort was spared to obliterate all survivals of Dutch nationality.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 716: L.

The Settlement by the Congress of Vienna: the Constitution of\r\n1815.*--With the overthrow of Napoleon the fate of both the Dutch and\r\nthe Belgian provinces fell to the arbitrament of the allied powers. In\r\nthe first Treaty of Paris, concluded May 30, 1814, between the Allies\r\non the one side and France on the other, it was stipulated that the\r\nBelgian territories should be joined with Holland and that the whole,\r\nunder the name of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands, should be\r\nassigned to the restored house of Orange, in the person of William I.,\r\nson of the stadtholder William V. Already, consequent upon the Dutch\r\nrevolt which followed the defeat of Napoleon at Leipzig, William had\r\nbeen recalled from his eighteen-year exile. December 1, 1813, he had\r\naccepted formally the sovereignty of the Dutch provinces, and early in\r\n1814 a constitution had been drawn up and put in operation. The desire\r\nof the Allies, particularly of Great Britain, was that there should be\r\nbrought into existence in the Low Countries a state which should be\r\nsufficiently powerful to constitute a barrier to possible aggressions\r\nof France upon the north. The union of the Belgian with the Dutch\r\nprovinces, was intended furthermore, to compensate the Dutch in    (p. 519)\r\nsome measure for their losses of colonial possessions to Great\r\nBritain during the war. By the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna,\r\nJune 9, 1815, and by the second Peace of Paris, November 20 following,\r\nthe arrangement was ratified. With Holland and the Austrian\r\nNetherlands were united in the new state the bishopric of Liège, the\r\nduchy of Limburg, and the duchy (henceforth to be known as the\r\ngrand-duchy) of Luxemburg. The last-mentioned territory, while\r\nincluded in the Germanic Confederation, was bestowed upon the Dutch\r\nsovereign in compensation for German principalities ceded by him at\r\nthis time to Prussia.[718] March 15, 1815, William began his reign\r\nunder the new régime in Holland, and September 27 following he was\r\ncrowned at Brussels.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 718: These ceded territories comprised\r\n                   the ancestral domains of the house of Nassau which\r\n                   lay in Germany--Dietz, Siegen, Hadamar, and\r\n                   Dillenburg. The grand-duchy of Luxemburg was joined\r\n                   with the Netherlands by a personal union only, and\r\n                   in its capital, as a fortress of the German\r\n                   Confederation, was maintained a Prussian garrison.\r\n                   William dealt with the territory, however,\r\n                   precisely as if it were an integral part of his\r\n                   kingdom, extending to it the constitution of 1815\r\n                   and administering its affairs through the agency of\r\n                   Dutch officials. At the time of the Belgian revolt,\r\n                   in 1830, Luxemburg broke away from Dutch rule and\r\n                   there ensued in the history of the grand-duchy an\r\n                   anomalous period during which the legal status of\r\n                   the territory was hotly disputed. In 1839 the\r\n                   Conference of London assigned to Belgium that\r\n                   portion of the grand-duchy which was contiguous to\r\n                   her frontiers and remanded the remainder to the\r\n                   status of an hereditary possession of the house of\r\n                   Nassau. In 1856 a separate constitution was granted\r\n                   the people of the territory, and in 1867, following\r\n                   the dissolution of the old Germanic Confederation,\r\n                   the grand-duchy was declared by an international\r\n                   conference at London to be a sovereign and\r\n                   independent (but neutral) state, under the guaranty\r\n                   of the powers. The connection between Luxemburg and\r\n                   Holland was thereafter purely dynastic. Until the\r\n                   death of William III., in 1890, the king of the\r\n                   Netherlands was also grand-duke of Luxemburg; but\r\n                   with the accession of Queen Wilhelmina the union of\r\n                   the two countries was terminated, by reason of the\r\n                   fact that females were at that time excluded from\r\n                   the throne of the grand-duchy. A law of 1907,\r\n                   however, vested the succession in the princess\r\n                   Marie, eldest daughter of the reigning Grand-Duke\r\n                   William; and upon the death of her father, Feb. 26,\r\n                   1912, this heiress succeeded to the grand-ducal\r\n                   throne. The head of the state is the grand-duke (or\r\n                   grand-duchess). There is a council of state\r\n                   nominated by the sovereign and a chamber of\r\n                   deputies of 53 members, elected directly by the\r\n                   cantons for six years. The state has an area of but\r\n                   998 square miles and a population (in 1910) of\r\n                   259,891. P. Eyschen, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Grossherzogtums Luxemburg (Tübingen, 1910).]\r\n\r\nIn fulfillment of a promise made his people, King William promulgated,\r\nAugust 24, 1815, a new constitution, drafted by a commission\r\nconsisting of an equal number of Dutch and Belgian members. The\r\ninstrument provided for a States-General of two chambers, one\r\nconsisting of members appointed for life by the crown, the other\r\ncomposed of an equal number (55) of Dutch and Belgian deputies elected\r\nby the provincial estates. Bills might be rejected, but might not  (p. 520)\r\nbe originated or amended, by this assembly. The suffrage was severely\r\nrestricted; trial by jury was not guaranteed; the budget was to be\r\nvoted for a number of years at a time; ministers were declared\r\nresponsible solely to the king; and, all in all, there was in the new\r\nsystem little enough of liberalism. When the instrument was laid\r\nbefore a Belgian assembly it was overwhelmingly rejected. None the\r\nless it was declared in effect, and it continued the fundamental law\r\nof the united dominions of William I. until 1830.\r\n\r\n*572. The Belgian Revolution, 1830-1831.*--Friction between the Dutch\r\nand the Belgians was from the outset incessant. The union was\r\nessentially an artificial one, and the honest efforts of the king to\r\nbring about a genuine amalgamation but emphasized the irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of language, religion, economic interest, and political\r\ninheritance that separated the two peoples. The population of Belgium\r\nwas 3,400,000; that of Holland but 2,000,000. Yet the voting power of\r\nthe former in the lower legislative chamber was no greater than that\r\nof the latter, and in fact the Dutch were able all the while to\r\nmaintain in that body a small working majority. Administrative offices\r\nwere filled, in large part, by Dutchmen, and the attitude quite\r\ncommonly assumed (in a measure, without doubt, unconsciously) by the\r\npublic authorities strongly suggested that Holland was the\r\npreponderating power and Belgium little more than so much subjugated\r\nterritory. The upshot was discontent and eventual rebellion. In 1828\r\nthe principal political parties of Belgium, the Catholics and the\r\nLiberals, drew together in the \"Union,\" the object of which was to\r\nbring about the recognition of Belgian independence, or, in the event\r\nthat this should prove impossible of attainment, the establishment of\r\nthoroughgoing Belgian autonomy, with no union with Holland save of a\r\npurely personal character through the crown. Inspired by the success\r\nof the July Revolution in France, and hopeful of obtaining French\r\nassistance, the Belgians in August, 1830, broke into open revolt.\r\nAfter a period of violence, a provisional government at Brussels,\r\nOctober 4, 1830, proclaimed Belgium's independence and summoned a\r\nnational congress to which was committed the task of drawing up a\r\nscheme of government. Aroused by the imminent loss of half of his\r\ndominion, King William, after an ineffectual display of military\r\nforce, offered concessions; and the States-General went so far as to\r\nauthorize the establishment in the southern provinces of a separate\r\nadministrative system, such as at one time would have met the Belgian\r\ndemand. The day for compromise, however, had passed. The Belgian\r\ncongress voted overwhelmingly for the establishment of an independent\r\nmonarchy, adopted (February 7, 1831) a liberal constitution, and,  (p. 521)\r\nafter offering the throne without avail to the Duke of Nemours, second\r\nson of Louis Philippe of France, selected as king the German Prince\r\nLeopold of Saxe-Coburg, who, under the title of Leopold I., was\r\ncrowned July 21 of the same year.\r\n\r\n*573. The Independence of Belgium.*--These proceedings involved the\r\noverturning of an arrangement which the Allies in 1815 had considered\r\nessential to the security of Europe. Several considerations,\r\nhowever,--among them the outbreak of insurrection in Poland,--induced\r\nthe powers to acquiesce with unexpected readiness in the dissolution\r\nof the loose-jointed monarchy. December 20, 1830, a conference of the\r\nfive principal powers at London formally pronounced in favor of a\r\npermanent separation, and when, in August, 1831, a Dutch army crossed\r\nthe frontier and inflicted upon the Belgians an overwhelming defeat, a\r\nFrench force compelled the invaders to surrender the fruits of their\r\nvictory and to retire from the country. A treaty of separation was\r\ndrawn up by the London conference under date of November 25, 1831,\r\nunder whose terms there were recognized both the independence and the\r\nneutrality of the new Belgian monarchy. William of Holland protested\r\nand flatly refused to sign the instrument. The British and French\r\ngovernments compelled him outwardly to acquiesce in the agreement,\r\nalthough it was not until April 19, 1839, that he gave it his formal\r\nassent. Embittered by his losses and chagrined by the constitutional\r\namendments to which his own people compelled him to submit, he\r\nabdicated in 1840 in favor of his son.[719]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 719: On the constitutional aspects of\r\n                   Dutch-Belgian history in the period 1815-1840 see\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap. 16\r\n                   (bibliography, pp. 848-851); D.

Constitutional Revision in Holland.*--After 1831 the\r\nconstitutional development of Holland and that of Belgium move in\r\nseparate channels.[720] In Holland the fundamental law of 1815 was\r\nretained, but the modifications which have been introduced in it,\r\nnotably in 1840, 1848, and 1887, have so altered its character as to\r\nhave made of it an essentially new instrument. The revision of 1840\r\nwas forced upon the king by the Liberals, whose position was\r\nstrengthened by the fiscal chaos into which the nation had fallen  (p. 522)\r\nunder the previous autocratic régime. The reformers got very much less\r\nthan they demanded. Instead of the ministerial responsibility and the\r\npublic control of the finances for which they asked they procured only\r\nan arrangement to the effect that the budget should be submitted to\r\nthe States-General every two years and the colonial balance sheet\r\nyearly, together with certain changes of detail, including a\r\ncurtailment of the civil list and a reduction of the membership of the\r\nStates-General in consequence of the loss of Belgium. Yet these\r\nreforms were well worth while.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 720: For that of Belgium see p. 534.]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of William II. (1840-1849) the demand for\r\nconstitutional revision was incessant. The king was profuse in\r\npromises, but vacillating. In 1844, and again in 1845, a specific\r\nprogramme of revision failed of adoption. By 1848, however, economic\r\ndistress and popular discontent had become so pronounced that the\r\nsovereign was forced to act. The overthrow of Louis Philippe at Paris,\r\ntoo, was not without effect. March 17 the king named a state\r\ncommission of five members which was authorized to draft a revision of\r\nthe constitution, and the resulting instrument, after being adopted in\r\nan extraordinary session of the States-General, was promulgated\r\nNovember 3. The revision of 1848 introduced into the Dutch\r\nconstitutional system many fundamental changes. Instead of being\r\nappointed by the crown, members of the upper branch of the\r\nStates-General were thereafter to be elected by the provincial\r\nestates; and in the choice of members of the lower house, direct\r\npopular elections were substituted for indirect. The ministers of the\r\nking were made responsible to the States-General, and the powers of\r\nthe legislative body were otherwise increased through the extension of\r\nits authority over colonial affairs, provision for a regular annual\r\nbudget, and, most of all, recognition of the right to initiate and to\r\namend projects of legislation. Constitutional government in Holland\r\nmay be said virtually to have had its beginning in 1848.\r\n\r\n*575. The Constitution To-day.*--Through several decades following the\r\naccession of William III., in 1849, the political history of Holland\r\ncomprises largely a story of party strife, accentuated by the efforts\r\nof the various political groups--especially the Liberals, the\r\nConservatives, and the Catholics--to apply in practice the\r\nparliamentary system.[721] The death of Prince Alexander, June 21,\r\n1884, occasioned a constitutional amendment to provide for the\r\naccession of a female sovereign and the establishment of a regency,\r\nand three years later a parliamentary deadlock compelled the king to\r\nauthorize a general revision of the fundamental law whereby the    (p. 523)\r\nnumber of citizens in possession of the franchise was more than\r\ntripled. The constitution of Holland at the present day is the amended\r\ninstrument of November 6, 1887. It comprises more than two hundred\r\narticles, being, indeed, one of the lengthiest documents of its kind\r\nin existence. Like most European constitutions, it may be amended by\r\nthe ordinary legislative organs, though under specially prescribed\r\nconditions. The first step in the amending process consists in the\r\nadoption by the legislative chambers of a resolution affirming that\r\nthere is sufficient reason for taking under consideration the\r\namendment or amendments in hand. Following the promulgation of this\r\nresolution the chambers are required to be dissolved. The newly\r\nelected houses then take up the project for final disposition, and if\r\nby a two-thirds vote they adopt it, and if the sovereign assents, it\r\ngoes into operation.[722]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 721: Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chap.\r\n                   23.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 722: Arts. 194-197.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*576. Status of the Sovereign.*--The government of Holland[723] is in\r\nform a constitutional, hereditary monarchy. Until 1884 the royal\r\nsuccession was vested exclusively in the direct male line of the house\r\nof Orange-Nassau in the order of primogeniture. The death, however, in\r\nthe year mentioned, of the sole surviving male heir occasioned, as has\r\nbeen stated, an amendment of the constitution authorizing the succession\r\nof a female heir, in default of a male; and, upon the death of William\r\nIII., November 23, 1890, the throne accordingly passed to his only\r\ndaughter, the present Queen Wilhelmina.[724] In default of a legal\r\nheir, the successor to the throne is to be designated by a law presented\r\nby the crown and acted upon by a joint meeting of the legislative\r\nchambers, each house containing for this purpose double its usual  (p. 524)\r\nnumber of members. In the event of the minority or the incapacity of\r\nthe sovereign a regency is established, and the regent is named by law\r\nenacted by the States-General in joint session.[725]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 723: The official title is \"The Kingdom\r\n                   of the Netherlands.\" In ordinary usage, however,\r\n                   the term \"Holland\" is more commonly employed.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 724: Wilhelmina was at the time but ten\r\n                   years of age. Until she attained her majority,\r\n                   August 31, 1898, a regency was exercised by the\r\n                   Queen-Dowager Emma. E. Lemonon, La succession au\r\n                   trône néerlandais, in _Questions Diplomatiques et\r\n                   Coloniales_, December 1, 1908.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 725: Arts. 20-21. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 84.]\r\n\r\nThe sovereign, at accession, is installed in a public joint meeting of\r\nthe two chambers in the city of Amsterdam, and is required to take\r\noath always \"to observe and maintain the constitution;\" whereupon the\r\nmembers of the chambers solemnly pledge themselves \"to do everything\r\nthat a good and loyal States-General ought to do.\" The person of the\r\nmonarch is declared inviolable. For the maintenance of the royal\r\nestablishment the constitution stipulates that, in addition to the\r\nrevenue from the crown lands, the sovereign shall be entitled to a\r\nyearly income, to be paid out of the national treasury, together with\r\nsummer and winter residences, the maximum public expenditure upon\r\nwhich, however, is restricted to 50,000 florins a year. At each\r\naccession the amount of the annual stipend is fixed by law for the\r\nentire reign. William II.'s civil list was 1,000,000 guilders, but at\r\nthe accession of William III. in 1849 the amount was reduced to\r\n600,000, where it has remained to the present day. The family of\r\nOrange is possessed of a large private fortune, most of which was\r\naccumulated by William I. from a variety of commercial and industrial\r\nventures. The Prince of Orange, as heir apparent, is accorded by the\r\nstate an annual income of 100,000 florins, which is increased to\r\n200,000 upon his contracting a marriage authorized by law.\r\n\r\n*577. The Ministry.*--Associated with the sovereign is a Council of\r\nState, consisting of the Prince of Orange (when above eighteen years\r\nof age) and of a variable number of members appointed by the crown.\r\nThe number of members is at present fourteen. By the terms of the\r\nconstitution the sovereign is required to submit for discussion in the\r\nCouncil of State all matters to be presented to the States-General,\r\nand all general administrative questions of the kingdom and of its\r\ncolonies and possessions throughout the world.[726] Besides this\r\nadvisory Council of State there is a Council of Ministers, comprising\r\nthe heads of nine executive departments established by the sovereign.\r\nNominally the ministers are appointed and dismissed by the crown at\r\nwill, but actually the parliamentary system has acquired sufficient\r\nfoothold to impose upon the sovereign a considerable measure of\r\nrestriction at this point. All decrees and orders must be\r\ncountersigned by the head of one of the ministerial departments; and\r\nit is expressly stipulated that responsibility for all royal acts\r\nshall lie with the ministers.[727] The heads of ministerial        (p. 525)\r\ndepartments are privileged to occupy seats in both branches of the\r\nStates-General, but unless elected regularly as members they possess\r\nonly a deliberative voice in the proceedings of the chamber in which\r\nthey sit.[728]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 726: Art. 75. Ibid., II., 94.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 727: Art. 54. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 90.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 728: Art. 94. Ibid., II., 99.]\r\n\r\n*578. The Exercise of Executive Powers.*--Despite the liberalizing\r\ntendencies which underlie Dutch constitutional history since 1815, the\r\npowers of the crown are still enormous. Executive authority is vested\r\nsolely in the sovereign and the ministers, and there are not a few\r\nacts of importance which the sovereign may perform quite\r\nindependently. The sovereign exercises supreme control over foreign\r\nrelations, declares war, concludes and ratifies treaties,[729] confers\r\ntitles of nobility, appoints to public offices, coins money, grants\r\npardons in cases of penalties imposed by judicial sentence, maintains\r\nsupreme control over the land and naval forces, settles certain types\r\nof disputes arising between provinces, or between provinces and\r\ncommunes or corporations, issues general administrative regulations,\r\nrecommends projects of law to the States-General, and approves or\r\nrejects all measures adopted by that body. The sovereign is, however,\r\nin no sense above the law. Many things may not be done at all, save\r\nunder the authority of a regularly enacted piece of legislation.\r\nDispensations from legal provisions, for example, may be granted by\r\nthe crown only under the authority of law. In still other respects the\r\nsweeping grants of power contained within the constitution are\r\ntempered by counter-balancing stipulations. Thus, the sovereign has\r\nthe right to coin money; but it is also prescribed that \"the monetary\r\nsystem shall be regulated by law.\"[730] And the crown has \"supreme\r\ncontrol of the colonies and possessions of the kingdom in other parts\r\nof the world;\" but \"the regulations for the conduct of the government\r\nin the colonies and possessions shall be established by law.\"[731]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 729: Save that treaties which provide for\r\n                   modifications of the boundaries of the state, or\r\n                   impose a public pecuniary obligation, or contain\r\n                   any other provision touching legal rights, may not\r\n                   be approved by the crown until after sanction shall\r\n                   have been accorded by the States-General, unless\r\n                   the power has been reserved to the crown by law to\r\n                   conclude such a treaty. Art. 59. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 91.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 730: Art. 61. Ibid., II., 91.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 731: Art. 61. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE STATES-GENERAL AND POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*579. The Chambers: Earlier Electoral Arrangements.*--Legislative power\r\nwithin the kingdom is vested jointly in the sovereign and a States-General,\r\nor parliament, of two chambers. The upper chamber consists of      (p. 526)\r\nfifty members elected in varying proportions by the \"estates,\" or\r\nrepresentative assemblies, of the eleven provinces.[732] The term of\r\noffice is nine years, and one-third of the members retire triennially.\r\nMale citizens who have attained the age of thirty, who are in full\r\ncontrol of their property, and who have not been disqualified by\r\njudicial sentence, are eligible to membership, provided either that\r\nthey are among the heaviest payers of direct national taxes or that\r\nthey hold, or have held, one or more principal public offices\r\ndesignated by law.[733]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 732: The provincial quotas are as\r\n                   follows: South Holland, 10; North Holland, 9; North\r\n                   Brabant and Gelderland, 6 each; Friesland, 4;\r\n                   Overyssel, Groningen, and Limberg, 3 each; Zealand,\r\n                   Utrecht, and Drenthe, 2 each. Prior to the\r\n                   constitutional revision of 1848 members of the\r\n                   upper house were appointed by the king.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 733: Art. 90. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 98.]\r\n\r\nThe lower chamber consists of one hundred members elected directly by\r\nthe voters of the kingdom for a term of four years. Under the original\r\nconstitution of 1815 members of the lower house were chosen by the\r\nprovincial estates. Direct election was introduced by the\r\nconstitutional revision of 1848. During several decades the franchise,\r\nbased upon taxpaying qualifications, was narrowly restricted. After\r\n1870 the Liberals carried on a persistent campaign in behalf of a\r\nbroader electorate, and by a constitutional amendment of 1887 the\r\nfranchise was extended to all males twenty-three years of age and\r\nover, who are householders paying a minimum house-duty, lodgers who\r\nfor a time have paid a minimum rent, or who are possessed of \"signs of\r\nfitness and social well-being.\" The provisions relating to\r\nhouseholders and lodgers alone increased the electorate at a stroke\r\nfrom approximately 100,000 to 300,000. The precise meaning and\r\napplication of the phrase \"fitness and social well-being\" were left to\r\nbe defined by law, and through upwards of a decade political\r\ncontroversy in Holland centered principally about this question. The\r\ncoalition Catholic-Conservative ministry of 1888-1891 refused flatly\r\nto sanction the enactment of any sort of law upon the subject. In 1893\r\nthe Liberal Minister of the Interior, Tak van Poortvliet, brought\r\nforward a project whereby it was proposed to put upon the qualifying\r\nphrase an interpretation of well-nigh the broadest possible character.\r\nA man was to be regarded as fulfilling the educational requirement if\r\nhe were able to write, and the social requirement if simply he were\r\nnot a recipient of public charity. By the adoption of this scheme the\r\nnumber of electors would have been raised to something like 800,000,\r\nand Holland would have attained a reasonable approximation of manhood\r\nsuffrage. The Moderate Liberals, the Conservatives, and most of the\r\nCatholics opposed the proposition, and the elections of 1894       (p. 527)\r\nproved the supporters of the van Poortvliet programme to be in the\r\nminority. The total strength of the \"Takkians\" in the new chamber was\r\n46, of whom 35 were Liberals; that of the \"anti-Takkians\" was 54, of\r\nwhom 24 were Catholics.\r\n\r\n*580. The Electoral Law of 1896 and the Question of Electoral\r\nReform.*--In the newly constituted ministry it fell to Samuel van\r\nHouten, leader of a radical group that had opposed the van Poortvliet\r\nproject, to prepare an alternative measure. In the notable electoral\r\nlaw of 1896 the compromise proposals of van Houten were definitely\r\naccepted, and they constitute the essential features of the electoral\r\nsystem at the present day. Under this arrangement the members of the\r\nlower chamber are elected in one hundred single-member districts by\r\nmale citizens of the age of twenty-five and over, who meet any one of\r\nthe following qualifications: (1) payment of a direct tax of at least\r\none florin; (2) payment of a minimum rental as householders or\r\nlodgers; (3) proprietorship or rental of a vessel of at least\r\ntwenty-four tons; (4) the earning of a wage or salary varying from 275\r\nto 550 florins a year; (5) investment of one hundred florins in\r\ngovernment bonds, or of fifty florins in a savings bank; and (6) the\r\npassing of an examination required for entrance upon a public office\r\nor upon a private employment. By the reform of 1896 the number of\r\nvoters in the realm was increased to 700,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 there was created a royal commission of seven members to which\r\nwas assigned the task of considering and reporting proposals relative\r\nto proportional representation, the salaries of members, and other\r\nquestions of constitutional revision. The Government, however,\r\nreserved to itself specifically the right to bring forward proposals\r\nrelating to the actual extension of the franchise. The report of this\r\ncommission, submitted late in 1907, recommended, among other things,\r\nthe introduction of proportional representation and (by a vote of six\r\nout of seven) the extension of the franchise to women. These\r\nsuggestions failed of adoption, but late in 1910 a new commission was\r\nappointed, under the presidency of the Conservative premier Heemskerk,\r\nand to this body was given power to propose changes in any portion\r\nwhatsoever of the governmental order. The successful operation of\r\nproportional representation in adjoining countries, especially Belgium\r\nand Sweden, renders it probable that the system will be adopted\r\nultimately in Holland. The future of woman's suffrage is more\r\nproblematical. Women already possess the right to vote in the\r\nproceedings of the dike associations if they are taxpayers or if they\r\nown property adjoining the dikes, and in June, 1908, the Lutheran\r\nSynod gave women the right to vote in ecclesiastical affairs on a  (p. 528)\r\nfooting with men. Since 1894 there has been a National Woman's\r\nSuffrage Society, to which was added, in 1906, a Woman's Suffrage\r\nLeague; and women are freely admitted to membership in the political\r\nclubs maintained by the adherents of the various parties.\r\n\r\nAny male citizen who has attained his thirtieth year, who is in full\r\npossession of property, and who has not been disqualified by judicial\r\nsentence, is eligible to a seat in the popular chamber. By\r\nconstitutional provision, members are allowed, in addition to\r\ntravelling expenses, a salary of 2,000 florins a year; and, under law\r\nof May 4, 1889, members of the upper house who do not live in the\r\nplace of meeting receive a _per diem_ of ten florins during the\r\ncontinuance of each session.\r\n\r\n*581. The States-General: Organization and Powers.*--The constitution\r\nrequires that the States-General shall assemble at least once each\r\nyear and that its regular annual session shall be opened on the third\r\nTuesday in September. The sovereign may convoke an extraordinary\r\nsession at any time; but regular sessions are not dependent upon the\r\nroyal summons. The crown possesses the right to dissolve the houses,\r\nseparately or simultaneously; but a decree of dissolution must contain\r\nan order for the election of the new house, or houses, within fourteen\r\ndays, and for the assembling of the houses within two months.[734]\r\nExcept in the event of a dissolution, a regular session is required to\r\nextend through at least twenty days; but upon the expiration of the\r\ntwenty-day period the sovereign may terminate the sitting whenever in\r\nhis judgment \"the interests of the state no longer require its\r\ncontinuance.\"[735] The president of the upper house is appointed by\r\nthe crown from among the members for the period of one session. The\r\ncorresponding officer of the lower house is similarly appointed from a\r\nlist of three members submitted by the chamber. Each house appoints,\r\nfrom non-members, its clerk and such other officials as may be\r\nrequired; each examines the credentials of its newly elected members\r\nand renders final verdict upon their validity; and each regulates the\r\ndetails of its own procedure. Except when one-tenth of the members of\r\na chamber request the closing of the doors, or the president deems\r\nsuch a step necessary, sessions are public. Neither house may take\r\naction upon any matter unless at least half of its members are\r\npresent, and final action upon all propositions is taken by an\r\nabsolute majority of the members present. A portion of the business of\r\nthe States-General is transacted in joint sessions of the two houses.\r\nIn joint session the two are regarded as one chamber, under the\r\npresidency of the president of the upper house. For the changing   (p. 529)\r\nof the order of royal succession or the appointment of an heir to the\r\nthrone, the constitution requires that the membership of each chamber\r\nbe doubled. In such an event there is added to the regular members of\r\neach house an equal number of extraordinary members, elected in the\r\nsame manner as the regular members.[736]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 734: Art. 73. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 94.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 735: Art. 103. Ibid., II., 100.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 736: Art. 83. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 96.]\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings of the States-General the lower chamber enjoys a\r\ndistinct preponderance. The upper chamber, indeed, is commonly\r\nregarded as constitutionally the weakest body of its kind in Europe.\r\nIt possesses neither the power to initiate legislation, general or\r\nfinancial, nor power to amend projects of law. Any measure which comes\r\nbefore it must be accepted or rejected as it stands. Bills may be\r\noriginated either by the Government or by members of the lower\r\nchamber, and it is required that the sovereign shall send all\r\nrecommendations, whether pertaining to laws or to other matters, to\r\nthe lower house, in a written message or by committee.[737] The\r\nprojects of the general financial laws must be presented annually to\r\nthe lower house in the name of the crown, immediately after the\r\nopening of the regular session. No taxes may be levied save by law. In\r\naddition to its powers of a purely legislative character, the\r\nStates-General is authorized to investigate, either as separate\r\nchambers or in joint session, the executive conduct of public\r\naffairs.[738] Under stipulated conditions, the States-General, by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote, and with the assent of the crown, may amend the\r\nconstitution.[739]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 737: Art. 110. Ibid., II., 101.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 738: Art. 95. Ibid., II., 99.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 739: See p. 523.]\r\n\r\n*582. Political Parties: Election of 1903.*--Since the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century political preponderance has alternated irregularly\r\nbetween two principal party groups. One of these is the Liberals,\r\nrepresentative especially of the commercial towns, and falling into\r\nthe two general categories of Moderates and Progressives. The other is\r\nthe Conservatives, consisting largely of orthodox Protestants,\r\nespecially the Calvinistic peasantry, and supported, as a rule, by the\r\nCatholics. In more recent times the Socialists have made their\r\nappearance as a distinct political element, but thus far they have\r\ncast in their lot regularly with the Liberals. Between 1871 and 1888\r\nthe Liberals were in power continuously; and, after a brief interval\r\ncovered by a Conservative-Catholic ministry, they regained control and\r\nkept it throughout the decade 1891-1901. In 1901 a coalition ministry\r\nwas created, under the premiership of the Conservative Dr. Kuyper.\r\nThis lasted until 1903.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year mentioned the lower house rejected an    (p. 530)\r\nimportant measure relating to higher education upon whose enactment\r\nthe Kuyper ministry was determined. The Chamber was dissolved and in\r\nJune elections were held. Prior to the elections the Chamber contained\r\n58 Ministerialists and 42 anti-Ministerialists (Liberals and\r\nSocialists). The opposition elements were far from united. The\r\nSocialists insisted upon an immediate amendment of the constitution to\r\nprovide for universal suffrage; the Progressive Liberals favored only\r\nthe eventual adoption of such an amendment; the Moderate Liberals were\r\nopposed to it altogether. None the less, the result of the elections\r\nwas to terminate the Conservative majority and to replace it by a\r\nslender but indubitable Liberal majority of four. The Conservatives\r\ncarried 48 seats; the Liberals 45; and the Socialists 7. The Kuyper\r\nministry forthwith resigned.\r\n\r\n*583. The Political Situation Since 1909.*--The period from June, 1905,\r\nto December, 1907, was covered by the two successive Liberal\r\nministries of Borgesius and De Meester. Each was essentially\r\ncolorless. Efforts to bring about an extension of the suffrage failed,\r\nand during 1907 the Liberal majority virtually disappeared. The upshot\r\nwas that, February 8, 1908, there was created a new ministry, under\r\nDr. Heemskerk, whose members were drawn from the Conservatives. At the\r\ngeneral election of June 11, 1909, the Conservatives recovered\r\nsupremacy completely. Following the grouping which prevails at the\r\npresent day, the results of this election were as follows: (1)\r\nAnti-Revolutionaries (largely rural Calvinists), 23 members; (2)\r\nHistoric Christians, 12; (3) Roman Catholics, 25--a total Conservative\r\nquota of 60; (4) Free Liberals, 4; Union Liberals, 21; Liberal\r\nDemocrats, 8; Socialists, 7--a total Liberal contingent of 40.\r\nFurthermore, while the Conservatives were compactly organized, the\r\nLiberals were divided hopelessly among themselves and quite unable to\r\noffer substantial resistance to their opponents. With a majority of 20\r\nin the lower chamber and of 19 in the upper, with a popular vote in\r\nexcess by 80,000 of that of the Liberals, and with a ministry in\r\noffice which, if not brilliant, was at least popular, the\r\nConservatives came off from the campaign in a position to maintain\r\nthrough an extended period, so far as may be foreseen, their control\r\nof public affairs. Quite the contrary of the contemporary situation in\r\nBelgium, the rifts which separate the various Liberal groups tend in\r\nHolland to deepen, and the political impotence of Liberalism\r\nconsequently to be accentuated.[740]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 740: On Dutch political parties see P.\r\n                   Verschave, La Hollande politique; le rôle des\r\n                   catholiques néerlandais depuis dix ans, in _Le\r\n                   Correspondant_, April 10, 1908; Les élections\r\n                   générales et la situation politique aux pays-bas:\r\n                   l'organisation de la campagne électorale, ibid.,\r\n                   Nov. 25, 1909; and La Hollande politique; un parti\r\n                   catholique en pays protestant (Paris, 1910).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT                             (p. 531)\r\n\r\n*584. Judicial Principles.*--The constitution guarantees various\r\nfundamental personal rights, including those of petition, assembly,\r\nfree speech, and equality before the law in all matters pertaining to\r\nthe protection of person and property. It likewise undertakes to\r\nguarantee the individual against partiality and arbitrariness in the\r\nadministration of justice. Except in unusual cases, prescribed by law,\r\nno one may be taken into custody except upon a warrant issued by a\r\njudge, stating specifically the reason for arrest. No one may be\r\nremoved against his will from the jurisdiction of the tribunal in\r\nwhich he has a right to be tried. General confiscation of the property\r\nof a person adjudged guilty may not be imposed as a penalty for any\r\noffense. Save in exceptional cases, specified by law, or when in the\r\nopinion of the judge public order and morals forbid, the sessions of\r\nall courts are required to be public. Judgments must be pronounced in\r\npublic session. They must be accompanied by a statement of the\r\nconsiderations upon which they are based, and, in criminal cases, by a\r\ncitation of the specific provisions of law upon which the sentence is\r\nfounded.[741]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 741: Arts. 149-161. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 110-112.]\r\n\r\n*585. The Courts.*--Justice is administered throughout the kingdom in\r\nthe name of the crown, and all judicial officers are appointed by the\r\ncrown. Within the constitution provision is made only for a supreme\r\ntribunal known as the High Court (_Hooge Raad_) of the Netherlands,\r\nsitting at The Hague. Minor courts exist by virtue of ordinary law.\r\nThe judges of the High Court, five in number, are appointed by the\r\ncrown from lists prepared by the lower house of the States-General.\r\nThe junctions of the High Court are of large importance. On appeal\r\nfrom inferior tribunals it may annul any judicial proceeding, decree,\r\nor judgment held by it to be unwarranted by law. It is charged with\r\nthe duty of seeing that suits are properly tried and decided, and that\r\njudicial officials comply with the laws. Inferior judges are appointed\r\nnormally for life, but under conditions prescribed by law they may be\r\ndismissed or relieved of their duties by decision of the High Court.\r\nFinally, the High Court constitutes a tribunal before which, upon\r\ncharges brought by either the sovereign or the lower chamber, members\r\nof the States-General, heads of the ministerial departments,\r\ngovernors-general, members of the Council of State, and commissioners\r\nof the crown in the provinces, may be prosecuted upon charge of\r\noffenses committed in office. Such prosecution may be instituted   (p. 532)\r\neither during an official's tenure of office or after his retirement.[742]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 742: Arts. 162-166. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 112-113.]\r\n\r\nOf inferior tribunals there are three grades. At the bottom are the\r\ncantonal courts, 106 in number, consisting each of a single judge and\r\ntaking cognizance of claims under 200 guilders, breaches of police\r\nregulations, and other cases of a minor nature. Next are the district\r\ncourts, 23 in number, each consisting of three judges and exercising\r\nwithin the _arrondissement_ jurisdiction in matters of more weight.\r\nStill above the district tribunals are five courts of appeal, each\r\ncomprising a body of three judges. Trial by jury is unknown in\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n*586. Local Government: the Province.*--The constitution of the\r\nNetherlands is somewhat peculiar in that it prescribes at length not\r\nmerely the form and character of the national government, but also the\r\narrangements that shall prevail respecting the governments of the\r\nprovinces and the communes throughout the kingdom. Of provinces there\r\nare eleven; of communes, 1,123. The importance of the province is\r\nenhanced by the fact that the nation has sprung from a pure\r\nconfederation, the original autonomy of the federated provinces having\r\nnever been wholly obliterated under the present centralized régime.\r\nEach province has its own representative body, or \"provincial\r\nestates,\" a unicameral assembly whose members are chosen directly for\r\nsix years by all inhabitants of the province who are entitled to vote\r\nfor members of the lower house of the States-General. Half of the\r\nmembers retire every three years. The number of members varies,\r\naccording to the population of the province, from eighty in South\r\nHolland to thirty-five in Drenthe. The assembly meets at least twice a\r\nyear. Its powers are extensive, although it can perform no legislative\r\nact without the assent of the crown. It enacts ordinances, levies\r\ntaxes, prepares and submits to the sovereign an annual budget,\r\ncontrols in certain respects the municipalities, and elects those\r\nmembers of the upper branch of the States-General to which the\r\nindividual province is entitled.\r\n\r\nFor the exercise of executive authority within the province there are\r\ntwo agencies. The provincial assembly appoints from its own members a\r\ncommittee of six, known as the \"deputed states,\" to which, in\r\naccordance with conditions fixed by law, the daily administration of\r\naffairs is intrusted. Furthermore the sovereign appoints and\r\nestablishes in each province a commissioner who is charged with the\r\nexecution of royal orders and with a general supervision of the acts\r\nof the local authorities. This royal commissioner presides over the\r\ndeliberations of both the provincial estates and the committee of six,\r\npossessing in the committee the power also of voting. He is        (p. 533)\r\ndistinctly the chief magistrate of the province, and at the same time\r\nthe effective tie between the central and the provincial\r\ngovernments.[743]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 743: Arts. 127-141. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 105-108.]\r\n\r\n*587. Local Government: the Commune.*--In all essential respects the\r\ngovernment of the Dutch communes is prescribed by the national\r\nconstitution, with the result that that government is characterized by\r\nuniformity no less thoroughgoing than is the communal government of\r\nFrance. Within each commune is a council of from seven to forty-five\r\nmembers elected directly by the people of the commune for a term of\r\nsix years under franchise arrangements identical with those obtaining\r\nin the election of members of the provincial estates, save that no\r\none, although otherwise qualified to vote for communal councillors,\r\nmay exercise the privilege unless he contributes a minimum amount\r\nyearly to the communal rates. One-third of the members of the council\r\nretire every two years. The council meets publicly as frequently as\r\nbusiness requires. It enacts by-laws, levies taxes, supervises\r\neducation, and represents the interests of the commune, if occasion\r\narises, before the sovereign, the States-General, and the provincial\r\nestates. All of its legislative acts are liable to veto by the crown,\r\nand the municipal budget requires regularly the approval of the\r\ncommittee of the provincial estates. Executive authority within the\r\ncommune is vested in a burgomaster, or mayor, appointed by the\r\nsovereign for a term of six years, and a board of two to six\r\n_wethouders_, or aldermen, elected by and from the council. The\r\nburgomaster presides in the council and, as a representative of the\r\nroyal authority, may suspend for a period of thirty days any measure\r\nenacted.[744]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 744: Arts. 142-148.

THE CONSTITUTION--THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*588. The Constitution: Liberalism and Stability.*--The constitution of\r\nthe kingdom of Belgium was framed, consequent upon the declaration of\r\nBelgian independence October 4, 1830, by a national congress of two\r\nhundred elected delegates. It was promulgated February 7, 1831, and\r\nJuly 21 of the same year the first independent Belgian sovereign,\r\nLeopold I., took oath to observe and maintain it. Circumstances\r\nconspired to give the instrument a pronouncedly liberal character.\r\nDevised in the midst of a revolution brought on principally by the\r\nautocratic rule of King William I., it is, and was intended to be,\r\nuncommonly explicit in its definition of the royal prerogative. There\r\nwere Belgians in 1831, indeed, who advocated the establishment of a\r\nrepublic. Against such a course various considerations were urged, and\r\nwith effect; but the monarchy which was set up, owing clearly its\r\nexistence to popular suffrage, is of the strictly limited,\r\nconstitutional type. \"All powers,\" it is asserted in the fundamental\r\nlaw, \"emanate from the people.\"[745] The principles of liberalism are\r\nthe more in evidence by reason of the fact that the framers of the\r\nconstitution deliberately accepted as models the French instruments of\r\n1791 and 1830 and were likewise influenced profoundly by their\r\nadmiration for the constitutional system of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 745: Art. 25. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 130.]\r\n\r\nA striking testimony to the thoroughness with which the work was done,\r\nand to the advanced character of the governmental system established,\r\nis the fact that the text of the Belgian fundamental law endured\r\nthrough more than half a century absolutely unchanged, and, further,\r\nthat when in our own generation the task of amendment was undertaken\r\nnot even the most ardent revisionists cared to insist upon more than\r\nthe overhauling of the arrangements respecting the franchise. Leopold\r\nI.(1831-1865), and Leopold II. after him (1865-1909), frankly\r\nrecognized the conditional basis of the royal tenure and, although\r\nconspicuously active in the management of public affairs, afforded (p. 535)\r\nby their conduct slight occasion for popular criticism or disaffection.\r\nEven the revolutionary year 1848 passed without producing in Belgium\r\nmore than a mere ripple of unrest. In 1893 the constitution was\r\namended to provide for universal male suffrage, and in 1899 a further\r\namendment instituted a system of proportional representation.\r\nOtherwise, the instrument stands to-day virtually as it was put into\r\noperation in 1831. It need hardly be remarked that, in Belgium as\r\nelsewhere, the written constitution does not by any means contain the\r\nwhole of the actually operative political system. Numerous aspects of\r\nparliamentarism, and of other well-established governmental forms and\r\npractices, depend for their sanction upon the conventions, rather than\r\nupon the law, of the constitution; but they are none the less real and\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n*589. Content and Amendment.*--The written constitution of Belgium, like\r\nthat of Holland, is comprehensive in scope. It comprises an extended\r\nbill of rights; a detailed definition of the framework of the national\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial departments; special provisions\r\nrelating to finance and the army; and an enumeration of the principles\r\nunderlying the provincial and communal administration. It contains a\r\ntotal of 139 articles, of which eight, being temporary in character,\r\nare inoperative. The process of amendment is identical with that which\r\nprevails in Holland. Upon declaration by the legislative chambers to\r\nthe effect that a specified amendment is desirable, the chambers are\r\n_ipso facto_ dissolved. If the chambers thereupon elected approve the\r\nproposition by a two-thirds vote, and the sovereign accords it his\r\nsanction, it is declared adopted.[746]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 746: Art. 131.

The Crown.*--Kingship in Belgium is hereditary in the        (p. 536)\r\ndirect male line in the order of primogeniture. In default of male\r\ndescendants, the king, with the consent of the legislative chambers,\r\nmay name his successor.[747] A king or heir to the throne attains his\r\nmajority at the age of eighteen. In the event of a minority, or of the\r\nincapacity of the sovereign, the two houses are required to meet in a\r\nsingle assembly for the purpose of making provision for a regency. The\r\npowers of regent may not be conferred upon two or more persons\r\njointly, and during the continuance of a regency no changes may be\r\nmade in the constitution.[748] If by chance the throne should fall\r\nwholly vacant, the choice of a sovereign would devolve upon the\r\nlegislative chambers, specially re-elected for the purpose, and\r\ndeliberating in joint session. The civil list of the crown is fixed at\r\nthe beginning of a reign. That of Leopold II., as established by law\r\nof December 25, 1865, was 3,300,000 francs, and that of the present\r\nsovereign, Albert I., is the same.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 747: This privilege was conferred by an\r\n                   amendment (Art. 61) adopted September 7, 1893.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 748: Arts. 60, 79-85. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 136, 138-139.]\r\n\r\n*591. The Ministers and the Parliamentary System.*--The Council of\r\nMinisters consists of ten heads of executive departments. These,\r\ntogether with a variable number of ministers without portfolio,\r\ncomprise the Council of State, an advisory body convened by the crown\r\nas occasion requires. All ministers are appointed, directly or\r\nindirectly, and all may be dismissed, by the king. All must be Belgian\r\ncitizens, and no member of the royal family may be tendered an\r\nappointment. Ministers are all but invariably members of one or the\r\nother of the legislative houses, principally of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.[749] Whether members or not, they are privileged to\r\nattend all sessions and to be heard at their own request. The houses,\r\nindeed, possess the right to demand their attendance. But no minister\r\nmay vote, save in a house of which he is a member.[750]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 749: The minister of war, regularly an\r\n                   active military official, has been usually not a\r\n                   legislative member. Aside from this one post,\r\n                   however, the custom of selecting ministers\r\n                   exclusively from the chambers has been followed\r\n                   almost as rigorously in Belgium as in Great\r\n                   Britain. And so largely are the ministers taken\r\n                   from the lower house that the Senate not\r\n                   infrequently has no representative at all in the\r\n                   cabinet.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 750: Arts. 86-91. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 139-140.]\r\n\r\nBelgium is one of the few continental states in which the parliamentary\r\nsystem is thoroughly operative. At no point is the constitution more\r\nexplicit than in its stipulation of the responsibility of ministers.\r\nNot only is it declared that the king's ministers are responsible; it\r\nis stipulated that \"no decree of the king shall take effect unless it\r\nis countersigned by a minister, who, by that act alone, renders himself\r\nresponsible for it\"; also that \"in no case shall the verbal or     (p. 537)\r\nwritten order of the king relieve a minister of responsibility.\"[751]\r\nThe House of Representatives is vested with the right to accuse\r\nministers and to arraign them before the Court of Cassation; and the\r\nking may not pardon a minister who has been sentenced by this\r\ntribunal, save upon request of one of the two legislative chambers. A\r\nministry which finds that it cannot command the support of a majority\r\nin the House of Representatives has the right to determine upon the\r\ndissolution of either of the houses, or of both. If after a general\r\nelection there is still lack of harmony, the ministry, as would be the\r\nprocedure in a similar situation in Great Britain, retires from\r\noffice, the sovereign calls upon an opposition party leader to assume\r\nthe premiership and to form a cabinet, and the remainder of the\r\nministers are selected from the dominant parties by this official, in\r\nconsultation with the king. By reason of the multiplicity of party\r\ngroups in Belgium, the king is apt to be allowed somewhat wider\r\nlatitude in the choice of a premier than is possible in Great\r\nBritain.[752]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 751: Arts. 63-64, 89. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 137, 140.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 752: Dupriez, Les Ministres, I., 210-230;\r\n                   O. Kerchove de Denterghem, De la responsabilité des\r\n                   ministres dans le droit public belge (Paris,\r\n                   1867).]\r\n\r\n*592. The Exercise of Executive Powers.*--The powers of the executive,\r\nexercised nominally by the king, but actually by the ministry, are\r\nclosely defined in the constitution; and there is the stipulation,\r\nunusual in European constitutions, that the king shall possess no\r\npowers other than those which the constitution, and the special laws\r\nenacted under the constitution, confer explicitly upon him.[753] Under\r\nthe conditions that have been explained, the king appoints all\r\nofficials who are attached to the general administrative and foreign\r\nservices, but other officials only in so far as is expressly\r\nauthorized by law. He commands the forces by land and sea, declares\r\nwar, and concludes peace. He negotiates treaties, with the limitation\r\nthat treaties of commerce and treaties which impose a burden upon the\r\nstate, or place under obligation individual Belgian citizens, take\r\neffect only after receiving the approval of the two houses; and with\r\nthe further condition that no cession, exchange, or acquisition of\r\nterritory may be carried through save by warrant of a law. The king\r\npromulgates all legislative measures, and he is authorized to issue\r\nall regulations and decrees necessary for the execution of the laws.\r\nIn theory he possesses the power of the veto, but in the Belgian, as\r\nin parliamentary governments generally, there is no occasion for the\r\nactual exercise of this power. The king convokes, prorogues, and\r\ndissolves the chambers; though the provisions of the constitution  (p. 538)\r\nrelating to the legislative sessions are so explicit that the crown is\r\nleft small discretion in the matter. The king, finally, is authorized\r\nto remit or to reduce the penalties imposed by the tribunals of\r\njustice, to coin money, to confer titles of nobility (which must be\r\npurely honorary), and to bestow military orders in accordance with\r\nprovisions of law.[754]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 753: Art. 78. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 138.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 754: Arts. 66-67. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 137-138.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT--THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n*593. The Senate.*--The Belgian parliament consists of two houses, both\r\nelective and both representative of the nation as a whole. The upper\r\nhouse, or Senate, is composed of 112 members, chosen for a term of\r\neight years. With respect to the method of their election, the members\r\nfall into two categories. Under constitutional provision, as amended\r\nby law of September 7, 1893, a number of senators equal to one-half\r\nthe number of members of the House of Representatives is elected\r\ndirectly by the voters, in proportion to the population of the several\r\nprovinces. The electorate which returns these senators is identical\r\nwith that which returns the deputies, and by law of December 29, 1899,\r\nthe principle of proportional representation, as applied in elections\r\nof the lower chamber, is applied to senatorial elections within each\r\nprovince. A second group of members consists of those elected by the\r\nprovincial councils, to the number of two for each province having\r\nfewer than 500,000 inhabitants, of three for each province having from\r\n500,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants, and of four for each province having\r\nmore than 1,000,000 inhabitants. The proportion of senators elected\r\ndirectly by the people is approximately three-fourths, being at\r\npresent 76 to 26. Prior to the amendment of 1893 all members of the\r\nSenate were chosen by the same electorate which chose the members of\r\nthe lower chamber. Inasmuch as only payers of direct taxes to the\r\namount of 2,000 francs a year were eligible as senators, the upper\r\nhouse represented almost exclusively the interests of wealth. By\r\nvesting in the provincial councils the choice of a portion of the\r\nsenators, who should be eligible regardless of taxpaying\r\nqualifications, it was hoped to impart to the Senate a more broadly\r\nrepresentative character. At the same time the tax qualification for\r\npopularly elected members was reduced by a third. It may be noted that\r\nthere is a possibility of a small non-elective element in the Senate.\r\nAccording to the terms of the constitution, the sons of the king, or\r\nif there be none, the Belgian princes of the branch of the royal\r\nfamily designated to succeed to the throne, shall be by right senators\r\nat the age of eighteen, though without deliberative vote until the (p. 539)\r\nage of twenty-five.[755] Prior to his accession to the throne, in\r\n1909, the present sovereign Albert I., nephew and heir-presumptive of\r\nLeopold II., was entitled to a senatorial seat. There is at present no\r\nrepresentative of royalty who is eligible.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 755: Art. 58. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 135.]\r\n\r\nAll elective senators must be Belgian citizens and Belgian residents,\r\nat least forty years of age, and in the unrestricted enjoyment of\r\ncivil and political rights. Senators elected by the provincial\r\ncouncils are subject to no property qualifications,[756] but those\r\nelected directly by the people must be drawn from either payers of as\r\nmuch as 1,200 francs of direct national taxes or proprietors or\r\nlessees of Belgian real estate of an assessed income of at least\r\n12,000 francs. In provinces, however, where the number of eligible\r\npersons falls short of the proportion of one for every 5,000\r\ninhabitants, the list is completed by the addition of such a number of\r\nthe heaviest taxpayers of the province as may be necessary to\r\nestablish this proportion.[757] Save passes on the national railways,\r\nsenators receive no salary or other emolument.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 756: They may not be, and may not have\r\n                   been within two years preceding their election,\r\n                   members of the assembly which returns them.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 757: Art. 56. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 135.]\r\n\r\n*594. The House of Representatives: Earlier Electoral\r\nArrangements.*--The lower legislative chamber consists of deputies\r\nelected directly by the voters of the kingdom. The number of seats is\r\ndetermined by law, under the general provision that it may not exceed\r\nthe proportion of one for 40,000 inhabitants. Prior to 1899 it was\r\n152; to-day it is 186. The term is four years. Half of the membership\r\nretires every two years, though in the event of a dissolution the\r\nhouse is entirely renewed.[758] The qualifications which the\r\nconstitution requires of deputies are those of citizenship, residence\r\nin Belgium, attainment of the age of twenty-five, and possession of\r\ncivil and political rights. Deputies receive an honorarium of 4,000\r\nfrancs a year, together with free transportation upon all State and\r\nconcessionary railways between the places of their respective\r\nresidences and Brussels, or any other city in which a session may be\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 758: This is true also of the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe Belgian electoral system at the present day is noteworthy by\r\nreason of three facts: (1) it is based upon the principle of universal\r\nmanhood suffrage; (2) it embraces a scheme of plural voting; and (3)\r\nit provides for the proportional representation of parties. Under the\r\noriginal constitution of 1831 the franchise, while not illiberal for\r\nthe time, was restricted by property qualifications of a somewhat\r\nsweeping character. Deputies were elected by those citizens only who\r\npaid yearly a direct tax varying in amount, but in no instance of less\r\nthan twenty florins. In 1848 there was enacted a series of         (p. 540)\r\nelectoral laws whereby the property qualification was reduced to a\r\nuniform level of twenty florins and the number of voters was virtually\r\ndoubled. With this arrangement the Liberals were by no means\r\nsatisfied, and agitation in behalf of a broader electorate was\r\nsteadily maintained. As early as 1865 the Liberal demands were\r\nactively re-enforced by those of organizations of workingmen, and in\r\n1870 the Catholic ministry found itself obliged to sanction a\r\nconsiderable extension of the franchise in elections within the\r\nprovinces and the communes. After 1880 the brunt of the electoral\r\npropaganda was borne by the Socialists, and the campaign for\r\nconstitutional revision was directed almost solely against the 47th\r\narticle of the fundamental law, in which was contained the original\r\nstipulation respecting the franchise. Since 1830 the population of\r\nBelgium had all but doubled, and there had been in the country an\r\nenormous increase of popular intelligence and of economic prosperity.\r\nThat in a population of 6,000,000 (in 1890) there should be an\r\nelectorate of but 135,000 was a sufficiently obvious anomaly. The\r\nbroadly democratic system by which members of the French Chamber of\r\nDeputies and of the German Reichstag were elected was proclaimed by\r\nthe revisionists to be the ideal which it was hoped to realize in\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n*595. The Electoral Reform Act of 1893.*--In 1890 the Catholic ministry,\r\nrecognizing in part the justice of the demand, and preferring, if\r\nthere were to be revision, to carry it through, rather than to incur\r\nthe risk of having it carried through by a radical cabinet, yielded to\r\nthe pressure and consented to the formal consideration of the\r\nelectoral question upon the floors of the two chambers. Three years of\r\nintermittent, but animated, discussion ensued. At length, in May,\r\n1892, the chambers were able to agree upon the primary proposition\r\nthat some sort of revision was necessary. Then came the dissolution\r\nwhich is required by the constitution in such a case, followed by a\r\ngeneral election. The newly chosen chambers, which for the purpose in\r\nhand comprised virtually a constituent convention, entered upon their\r\ntask later in the same year. In both the Catholics maintained a\r\nmajority, but by reason of the requirement of a two-thirds vote for\r\nthe adoption of a constitutional amendment, they were none the less\r\nobliged to rely upon the Liberals for a certain amount of support. In\r\nthe scheme of revision which was finally adopted all parties had some\r\nsubstantial share.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than fourteen distinct programmes of reform were laid before\r\nthe chambers.[759] The Conservatives, in general, desired the\r\nintroduction of a system based upon occupation combined with the   (p. 541)\r\npayment of taxes; the majority of the Liberals sought to secure\r\nspecial recognition for electors of approved capacity--in brief, an\r\neducational qualification; the Radicals inside, and the Socialists\r\noutside, Parliament carried on a relentless propaganda in behalf of\r\nuniversal, direct, and equal suffrage. The rejection in committee\r\n(April, 1893) of a plan of universal suffrage occasioned popular\r\ndemonstrations which required the calling out of the military, and\r\nwhen it was proposed to stop with a reduction of the age limit for\r\nvoters there were threats of a universal industrial strike. In the end\r\nall elements wisely receded from their extreme demands and it was\r\nfound possible to effect agreement upon a compromise. A Catholic\r\ndeputy--Albert Nyssens, professor at the University of Louvain--came\r\nforward with a scheme for manhood suffrage, safeguarded by the plural\r\nvote, and September 3, 1893, the plan was adopted.[760]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 759: It will be remembered that for the\r\n                   purpose of considering constitutional amendments\r\n                   the chambers meet in joint session.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 760: The Nyssens scheme was brought to\r\n                   the attention of the Belgian people through the\r\n                   medium of a pamphlet entitled \"Le suffrage\r\n                   universel tempéré.\"]\r\n\r\n*596. The Franchise To-day.*--By the terms of the law of 1893, one vote\r\nis allotted to every male Belgian citizen who has attained the age of\r\ntwenty-five years, who is in unrestricted enjoyment of his civil and\r\npolitical rights, and who has been resident at least one year in a\r\ngiven commune. There is nothing whatsoever in the nature of either an\r\neducational or a property qualification. Having conferred, however,\r\nupon the mass of male citizens the right to vote, the law proceeds to\r\ndefine the conditions under which a citizen may be entitled to two\r\nvotes, or even three. One supplementary vote is conferred upon (1)\r\nevery male citizen over thirty-five years of age, married or a\r\nwidower, with legitimate offspring, and paying to the state as a\r\nhouseholder a tax of not less than five francs, unless exempt by\r\nreason of his profession, and (2) every male citizen over twenty-five\r\nyears of age owning real estate to the assessed value of 2,000 francs,\r\nor possessing income from land corresponding to such valuation, or who\r\nfor two years has derived a minimum interest return of one hundred\r\nfrancs a year from Belgian funds, in the form of either government\r\nbonds or obligations of the Belgian government savings-bank. Two\r\nsupplementary votes are conferred upon citizens over twenty-five years\r\nof age who (1) hold a diploma from an institution of higher learning,\r\nor an indorsed certificate testifying to the completion of a course of\r\nsecondary education of the higher grade; or (2) occupy or have\r\noccupied a public office, hold or have held a position, practice or\r\nhave practiced a profession, which presupposes the knowledge imparted\r\nin secondary instruction of the higher grade--such offices,        (p. 542)\r\npositions, and professions to be defined from time to time by law.[761]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 761: Art. 47. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 132-133.]\r\n\r\nWhat, therefore, the law of 1893 does is, broadly, to confer upon\r\nevery male citizen one vote and to specify three principal conditions\r\nunder which this basal voting power may be augmented. As the head of a\r\nfamily, the citizen's suffrage may be doubled. By reason of his\r\npossession of property or of capital, it likewise may be doubled. On\r\nthe basis of a not unattainable educational qualification, it may be\r\ntripled. Under no circumstances may an individual be entitled to more\r\nthan three votes. The plural vote of Belgium differs, therefore, from\r\nthat of Great Britain, not only in that it is based upon a variety of\r\nqualifications of which property ownership is but one, but also in\r\nthat there is fixed an absolute and reasonably low maximum of votes.\r\nIt is of interest further to observe that voting is declared by the\r\nBelgian constitution to be obligatory. Failure to appear at the polls,\r\nwithout adequate excuse made to the election officer, is a\r\nmisdemeanor, punishable by law. The citizen may, if he likes, evade\r\nthe law by depositing a blank ballot. But he must deposit a ballot of\r\nsome sort.[762]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 762: On the earlier aspects of Belgian\r\n                   electoral reform see J.

PARTIES AND ELECTORAL REFORM SINCE 1894--PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE\r\n\r\n*597. The Adoption of Proportional Representation, 1899.*--The first\r\nelection held under the law of 1893, that of October 14, 1894,\r\ndemonstrated that by that measure the number of electors had been\r\nmultiplied almost exactly by ten. The total number of voters was now\r\n1,370,000; the number of votes cast was 2,111,000. Contrary to general\r\nexpectation, the election gave the Catholics an overwhelming majority\r\nin the lower chamber. They obtained 105 seats, the Socialists 29, and\r\nthe Liberals only 18. The elections of 1896 and 1898 gave the      (p. 543)\r\nCatholics a still more pronounced preponderance. At the beginning\r\nof 1899 the parties of the opposition could muster in the lower house\r\nonly forty votes and in the upper only thirty-one. The Liberal party\r\nwas threatened with extinction. Its popular strength, however, was\r\nstill considerable, and from both Liberals and Socialists there arose\r\nan insistent demand for the adoption of a scheme whereby the various\r\nparties should be accorded seats in the law-making bodies in\r\nproportion to their popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe idea of proportional representation was not at this time in\r\nBelgium a new one. It had been formulated and defended in the lower\r\nchamber as early as 1866. Since 1881 there had been maintained a\r\nnational reform organization whose purpose was in part to propagate\r\nit; and it is worthy of note that at the time of the revision of 1893\r\nthe ministry, led by the premier Beernaert, had advocated its\r\nadoption.[763] In 1895 the principle was introduced in a statute\r\nrelating to communal elections. Following a prolonged contest, which\r\ninvolved the retirement of two premiers, a bill extending the plan to\r\nparliamentary elections was pressed upon the somewhat divided Catholic\r\nforces and, December 29, 1899, was enacted into law. Under the\r\nprovisions of this measure deputies and the popularly elected senators\r\ncontinue to be chosen within the arrondissement by _scrutin de liste_.\r\nWithin each arrondissement the seats to be filled are distributed\r\namong the parties in proportion to the party strength as revealed at\r\nthe polls, the allotment taking place in accordance with the list\r\nsystem formulated by Victor d'Hondt, of the University of Ghent. The\r\nnumber of deputies elected in an arrondissement varies from three to\r\ntwenty-one. When an elector appears at the polls he presents his\r\nofficial \"summons\" to vote and receives from the presiding officer\r\none, two, or three ballot papers according to the number of votes to\r\nwhich he is entitled. He takes these papers to a private compartment,\r\nmarks them, places them in the ballot-box, and has returned to him his\r\nletter of summons stamped in such a way as to show that he has\r\nfulfilled the obligation imposed upon him by law. The candidates of\r\nthe various parties are presented in lists, and the task of the\r\nelector is merely to indicate his approval of one list for each of the\r\nvotes to which he is entitled. This he does by pencilling white spots\r\ncontained in the black squares at the head of the lists or against the\r\nnames of individual candidates. He may pencil only the spot at the (p. 544)\r\nhead of a list, thereby approving the order in which the candidates\r\nhave been arranged by the party managers; or, by marking spaces\r\nopposite names of candidates, he may indicate his preference for a\r\ndifferent order.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 763: Another interesting proposal in 1893\r\n                   was that at the discretion of the crown a\r\n                   legislative measure might be submitted to direct\r\n                   popular vote. By reason of the fear that such a\r\n                   scheme would vest in the crown an excess of power\r\n                   the experiment was not tried.]\r\n\r\n*598. How Seats Are Allotted.*--The process of the apportionment of\r\nseats may be illustrated by a hypothetical case. Let it be assumed\r\nthat within a given arrondissement four lists of parliamentary\r\ncandidates have been presented and that at the polls an aggregate vote\r\nof 33,000 is distributed as follows: Catholics, 16,000; Liberals,\r\n9,000; Socialists, 4,500; and Christian Democrats, 3,500. Let it be\r\nassumed, further, that the arrondissement is entitled to eight seats.\r\nThe total number of votes for each list is divided successively by the\r\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., and the results are arrayed thus:\r\n\r\n                                                 _Christian_\r\n              _Catholic_  _Liberal_  _Socialist_  _Democrat_\r\n              _List_[764]  _List_     _List_       _List_\r\n\r\n  Divided by 1  16,000      9,000      4,500        3,500\r\n  Divided by 2   8,000      4,500      2,250        1,750\r\n  Divided by 3   5,333      3,000      1,500        1,166\r\n  Divided by 4   4,000      2,250      1,125          875\r\n  Divided by 5   3,200      1,800        900          700\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 764: In point of fact, the lists as\r\n                   published and as placed before the voter are\r\n                   indicated merely by number.]\r\n\r\nThe eight highest numbers (eight being the number of seats to be\r\nfilled) are then arranged in order of magnitude as follows:\r\n\r\n  16,000\r\n   9,000\r\n   8,000\r\n   5,333\r\n   4,500\r\n   4,500\r\n   4,000\r\n   3,500\r\n\r\nThe lowest of these numbers, 3,500, becomes the common divisor, or the\r\n\"electoral quotient.\" The number of votes cast for each list is\r\ndivided by this quotient, and the resulting numbers (fractions being\r\ndisregarded) indicate the quota of seats to which each of the parties\r\nis entitled. In the case in hand the results would be:\r\n\r\n  16,000 divided by 3,500 = 4 Catholic seats\r\n   9,000 divided by 3,500 = 2 Liberal seats\r\n   4,500 divided by 3,500 = 1 Socialist seat\r\n   3,500 divided by 3,500 = 1 Christian Democrat seat\r\n\r\n*599. The Making up of the Lists.*--Lists of candidates are made   (p. 545)\r\nup, and the order in which the names of candidates appear is\r\ndetermined, by the local organizations of the respective parties. In\r\norder to be presented to the electorate a list must have the\r\npreviously expressed support of at least one hundred electors. A\r\ncandidate may stand as an independent, and his name will appear in a\r\nseparate \"list,\" providing his candidacy meets the condition that has\r\nbeen mentioned; and it is within the right of any organization or\r\ngroup, political or non-political, to place before the electorate a\r\nlist. The power of the organization responsible for the presentation\r\nof a list to fix the order of candidates' names is not a necessary\r\nfeature of the proportional system and it has been the object of much\r\ncriticism, but it is not clear that serious abuse has arisen from it.\r\nCandidates whose names stand near the top of the list are, of course,\r\nmore likely to be elected than those whose names appear further down,\r\nfor, under the prevailing rules, all votes indicated in the space at\r\nthe head of a list form a pool from which the candidates on the list\r\ndraw in succession as many votes as may be necessary to make their\r\nindividual total equal to the electoral quotient, the process\r\ncontinuing until the pool is exhausted. Only by receiving a large\r\nnumber of individual preferential votes can a candidate be elected to\r\nthe exclusion of a candidate whose name precedes his.[765]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 765: Valuable books dealing with\r\n                   proportional representation in Belgium are G.\r\n                   Lachapelle, La représentation proportionnelle en\r\n                   France et en Belgique (Paris, 1911); F.

The Elections of 1906, 1908, and 1910.*--The first parliamentary\r\nelection following the adoption of the proportional system--that of\r\nMay, 1900--left the Catholics with a larger preponderance in the lower\r\nchamber than they had dared expect.[766] None the less, the effect of\r\nthe change was distinctly to revive the all but defunct Liberal party,\r\nto stimulate enormously the aspirations of the Socialists, and, in (p. 546)\r\ngeneral, to replace the crushing Catholic plurality of former years by\r\na wide distribution of seats among representatives of the various\r\nparties and groups. Prior to the election of 1890 the Catholic\r\nmajority was 32. The election of 1900 left it at 16; that of 1902, at\r\n26; that of 1904, at 20; that of 1906, at 12; that of 1908, at 8; and\r\nthat of 1910, at 6. Following the elections which took place in five\r\nof the nine provinces in 1906, party strength in the Chamber was as\r\nfollows: Catholics, 89; Liberals, 46; Socialists, 30; Christian\r\nDemocrats, 1. After the elections in the other four provinces in 1908,\r\nit was: Catholics, 87; Liberals, 43; Socialists, 35; Christian\r\nDemocrats, 1.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 766: It will be recalled that the term of\r\n                   deputies is four years, half retiring every two\r\n                   years. There is, therefore, a parliamentary\r\n                   election, but not throughout the entire country,\r\n                   every second year.]\r\n\r\nThe elections of May, 1910,[767] were contested with unusual keenness\r\nby reason of the fact that the Liberal-Socialist coalition seemed to\r\nhave, for the first time in a quarter of a century, a distinct chance\r\nfor victory. The Catholics were notoriously divided upon certain\r\npublic issues, notably Premier Schollaert's Compulsory Military\r\nService bill, and it was believed in many quarters that their tenure\r\nof power was near an end. The Liberal hope, however, was doomed to\r\ndisappointment; for, although both Liberals and Socialists realized\r\nconsiderable gains in the popular vote in some portions of the\r\nkingdom, in only a single constituency was the gain sufficient to\r\ncarry a new seat. The consequence was that the Catholic majority was\r\nreduced, but not below six, and party strength in the Chamber stood:\r\nCatholics, 86; Liberals, 45; Socialists, 34; Christian Democrats, 1.\r\nAmong reasons that may be assigned for the Liberal failure are the\r\nfact that the country was prosperous and not disposed to precipitate a\r\nchange of governments, the alienation of some voters by the working\r\nrelations that had been established between the Liberals and the\r\nSocialists, and the advantage that regularly accrues to the Catholics\r\nfrom the plural vote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 767: In the five provinces of Brabant,\r\n                   Anvers, Namur, West Flanders, and Luxemburg, the\r\n                   term of whose deputies was about to expire.]\r\n\r\n*601. The Catholic Triumph in 1912.*--During the years 1910-1912 the\r\nCatholic tenure of power, prolonged uninterruptedly since 1884, seemed\r\nmore than once on the point of being broken. Most of the time,\r\nhowever, the legislative machine performed its functions sufficiently\r\nwell with a majority of but half a dozen seats, and the drift of\r\naffairs operated eventually to strengthen the Catholic position. In\r\nMarch, 1911, Premier Schollaert introduced an education bill looking\r\ntoward the placing of church schools upon a footing financially with\r\nthe schools maintained by the communes, and the opposition to this\r\nmeasure acquired such intensity that the author of the bill was forced\r\nto retire. But his successor, De Broqueville, a man of conciliatory\r\ntemperament, formed a new Catholic cabinet which, by falling back  (p. 547)\r\nupon a policy of \"marking time,\" contrived to stave off a genuine\r\ndefeat. In the municipal elections held throughout the country October\r\n15, 1911, the Liberal-Socialist candidates were very generally\r\nsuccessful, but the parliamentary elections which took place June 2,\r\n1912, had the unexpected result of entrenching the Catholic party more\r\nsecurely in power than in upwards of a decade. The combined assault of\r\nthe Liberals and the Socialists upon \"clericalism\" fell flat, and\r\nagainst the Government's contention that the extraordinary and\r\nincontestable prosperity of the country merited a continuance of\r\nCatholic rule no arguments were forthcoming which carried conviction\r\namong the voters. The Catholic vote showed an increase of 130,610, the\r\nLiberal and Socialist opposition an increase of 40,402, and the\r\nChristian Democrats a decrease of 4,692. The new chamber consists of\r\n101 Catholics, 45 Liberals, 38 Socialists, and 2 Christian Democrats,\r\ngiving the Government a clear majority of sixteen. The elections were\r\nmarked by grave public unrest, involving widespread strikes and\r\nanti-clerical demonstrations, with some loss of life. More clearly\r\nthan before was exhibited in this campaign the essentially bourgeois\r\nand doctrinaire character of the present Liberal party. The intimate\r\ntouch with the masses which in the days of its ascendancy, prior to\r\n1884, the party enjoyed has been lost, and more and more the\r\nproletariat is looking to the Socialists for propagation of the\r\nmeasures required for social and industrial amelioration.\r\n\r\n*602. The Demand for Further Reform.*--A project upon which the\r\nSocialists and Liberals in the last election, as upon several former\r\noccasions, have found it possible to unite is the abolition of the\r\nplural vote. Almost immediately after the adoption of the amendment of\r\n1893 the Socialists declared their purpose to wage war unremittingly\r\nupon this feature of the new system. In its stead they demanded that\r\nthere be substituted the rule of _un homme, un vote_, \"one man, one\r\nvote,\" with the age limit reduced to twenty-one years. Following the\r\ntriumph of the Catholics in 1900, the agitation of the Socialists was\r\nredoubled, and in it the Liberals very generally joined. Between the\r\ntwo groups there arose seemingly irreconcilable differences of method,\r\nthe Liberals being unable to approve the obstructionism and other\r\nviolent means employed by their allies. In time, however, the\r\nSocialist methods became more moderate, and the realization on the\r\npart of both elements that only by fighting together might they hope\r\nto win induced a fuller and more durable co-operation between the two.\r\nFor the time being the Socialists have subordinated to the establishment\r\nof universal and equal suffrage all other features of their political and\r\nindustrial programme.[768] Upon the desirability of maintaining    (p. 548)\r\nproportional representation all parties are agreed, and it is probably\r\nbut a question of time until the principle will be applied fully, as\r\nit is not to-day, in the elections of the provinces and communes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 768: August 15, 1911, Socialists and\r\n                   Liberals combined in an anti-plural-vote\r\n                   demonstration in Brussels in which 150,000 people\r\n                   are estimated to have taken part.

Finally, the king may dissolve the chambers, or either of\r\nthem; but the act of dissolution must include an order for an election\r\nwithin forty days and a summons of the newly elected parliament to\r\nmeet within two months.[769]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 769: Arts. 70-72. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 137.]\r\n\r\nEach house judges the qualifications of its members and decides all\r\ncontests arising in relation thereto; each elects, at the opening of a\r\nsession, its president, vice-president, secretaries, and other\r\nofficials; each determines by its own rules the manner in which its\r\npowers shall be exercised. Sessions are normally public; but by vote\r\nof an absolute majority, taken at the instigation of the president or\r\nof ten members, either body may decide to consider a specific subject\r\nbehind closed doors. Votes are taken _viva voce_ or by rising, but a\r\nvote on a bill as a whole must always be by roll call and _viva voce_.\r\nExcept on propositions pertaining to constitutional amendments and a\r\nfew matters (upon which a two-thirds vote is required), measures are\r\npassed by absolute majority. They must, however, be voted upon article\r\nby article.\r\n\r\nFrom the essentially democratic character of the Belgian government,\r\nit follows that the powers of the legislative chambers are comprehensive.\r\nThe functions of legislation are vested by the constitution conjointly\r\nin the king and the two houses, but in practice they are exercised (p. 549)\r\nin a very large measure by the houses alone. Each house, as well as\r\nthe crown, possesses full rights of legislative initiative, though it\r\nis required that all laws relating to the revenues or expenditures of\r\nthe state, or to military contingents, shall be voted first by the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Authoritative interpretation of measures\r\nenacted is confided exclusively to the legislative power, and each\r\nhouse is guaranteed the right to inquire into the conduct of public\r\naffairs and to compel the attendance of ministers for the purpose of\r\ninterpellation, although the lower house alone is given power to\r\nformulate charges against public officials and to arraign them before\r\nthe Court of Cassation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*604. The Courts.*--Aside from special military, commercial, and labor\r\ntribunals, the courts of Belgium comprise a symmetrical hierarchy\r\nmodelled upon that created under the Code Napoléon. At the bottom are\r\nthe courts of the 222 cantons, each consisting of a single justice of\r\nthe peace, vested in ordinary breaches of police regulations with sole\r\nauthority, though in more serious cases associated with the\r\nburgomaster of the commune. Next above are the tribunals of first\r\ninstance, one in each of the twenty-six arrondissements into which the\r\nkingdom is divided, and each consisting of three judges. The court of\r\nfirst instance serves as a court of appeal from the decisions of the\r\ncantonal tribunal, and at the same time it possesses original\r\njurisdiction in more serious cases of crime and misdemeanors within\r\nthe arrondissement. Above the courts of first instance stand the three\r\ncourts of appeal, sitting at Brussels, Ghent, and Liège. That at\r\nBrussels consists of four chambers. At the apex is the Court of\r\nCassation, sitting at the capital. In this supreme tribunal there is\r\nbut a single judge, but associated with him is a large staff of\r\nassistants. The function of the Court of Cassation is to determine\r\nwhether the decisions of inferior tribunals are in accord with the law\r\nand to annul such as are not. It is of interest to observe, however,\r\nthat it is the Court of Cassation that tries a minister upon charges\r\npreferred by the House of Representatives, and this is the only\r\ncircumstance under which the tribunal exercises any measure of\r\noriginal jurisdiction. The creation of the Court of Cassation and of\r\nthe three courts of appeal is specifically provided for within the\r\nconstitution. All inferior tribunals are created by law, and none are\r\npermitted to be established otherwise. For the trial of criminal cases\r\nthere are special tribunals, in three grades: police courts,\r\ncorrectional courts, and courts of assize.\r\n\r\nAll judges and justices of the peace are appointed by the king for\r\nlife. Members of the courts of appeal and the presidents and       (p. 550)\r\nvice-presidents of the courts of original jurisdiction are selected\r\nfrom two double lists presented, the one by these courts and the other\r\nby the provincial councils. Members of the Court of Cassation are\r\nselected from two double lists presented, the one by the Senate and\r\nthe other by the Court itself. All other judicial officers are\r\nappointed by the crown independently. Except for urgent reasons of\r\npublic order or morals, sessions of all tribunals are public, and\r\nevery judgment must be pronounced in open court. Unlike Holland,\r\nBelgium has a well developed system of trial by jury. Jury trial is\r\nguaranteed by the constitution in all criminal cases and in all cases\r\ninvolving political or press offenses. As in England and the United\r\nStates, it is the function of the jury to determine whether or not the\r\naccused is guilty and that of the court to explain the law and to\r\npronounce sentence. A jury consists regularly of twelve members.[770]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 770: Arts. 92-107. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 140-142. Roubion, La séparation\r\n                   des pouvoirs administratif et judiciaire en\r\n                   Belgique (Paris, 1905).]\r\n\r\n*605. Local Government: Province and Arrondissement.*--Upon the subject\r\nof local government the constitution of Belgium is less explicit than\r\nis that of Holland. Aside from specifying that provincial and communal\r\ninstitutions shall be regulated by law, it contents itself with an\r\nenumeration of certain principles--among them direct elections,\r\npublicity of sittings of provincial and communal councils, publicity\r\nof budgets and accounts--whose application is regularly to be\r\nmaintained.[771] Of local governmental units there are three:[772] the\r\nprovince, the arrondissement, and the commune. The provinces are nine\r\nin number.[773] In each is a council, elected by all resident citizens\r\nwho are entitled to participate in the direct election of senators.\r\nThe term is eight years, half of the membership being renewed every\r\nfour years. The council meets at least once a year, on the first\r\nTuesday in July. Its sessions must not exceed four weeks in length nor\r\nbe briefer than fifteen days. Special sessions may be called by the\r\nking. The council considers and takes action upon substantially all\r\nlegislative, administrative, and fiscal affairs which concern the\r\nprovince alone. It elects from its own members a permanent deputation\r\nof six men which is charged with the government of the province while\r\nthe council is not in session. This deputation is presided over by the\r\ngovernor-general of the province who is appointed by the crown and\r\nwho serves as the principal intermediary between the provincial    (p. 551)\r\nand the central governments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 771: Arts. 108-109. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 142-143.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 772: Not including the canton, which\r\n                   exists purely for judicial purposes. It is the\r\n                   jurisdiction of the justice of the peace.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 773: Antwerp, Brabant, East Flanders,\r\n                   West Flanders, Hainaut, Liège, Limburg, Luxemburg,\r\n                   and Namur.]\r\n\r\nThe arrondissement, or district (twenty-six in number), is important\r\nchiefly as an electoral and judicial unit. Members of the lower house\r\nof the national parliament are elected within the arrondissement under\r\nthe scheme of proportional representation which has been described;\r\nand, as has been pointed out, each arrondissement is the seat of a\r\ncourt of first instance.\r\n\r\n*606. The Commune.*--In Belgium, as in France and other continental\r\ncountries, the vital organism of local government is the commune. The\r\ntotal number of communes in the kingdom is 2,629. The principal agency\r\nof government within each is a council. Members of this council are\r\nelected for a term of eight years, under arrangements of a somewhat\r\ncomplicated character determined by the population of the commune.\r\nVoting is _viva voce_; plural votes (to a maximum of four) are\r\nauthorized; and seats, under certain conditions, are allocated in\r\naccordance with the principle of proportional representation. A\r\nsomewhat singular fact is that the aggregate communal electorate of\r\nthe kingdom is perceptibly smaller than the provincial or the\r\nnational. The fact arises largely from the circumstance that the\r\ncommunal voter is required to have been domiciled at least three years\r\nin the commune, while residence of but a single year is required for\r\nparticipation in provincial and parliamentary elections.[774]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 774: In 1902, 1,146,482 communal electors\r\n                   cast a total of 2,007,704 votes. In 1910-1911 there\r\n                   were 1,440,141 provincial, and 1,300,514 communal,\r\n                   voters.]\r\n\r\nThe administrative body of the commune consists of a burgomaster, or\r\nmayor, appointed by the crown (in communes whose population exceeds\r\n5,000 elected by the communal council) for a term of ten years, and a\r\ncollege of _échevins_, or aldermen, elected by and from the communal\r\ncouncil. The burgomaster is head of the local police, and to him and\r\nto the council fall the keeping of the register of births, marriages,\r\nand deaths, the making and enforcing of local ordinances, and, in\r\ngeneral, the safeguarding of the welfare of the community. The more\r\nimportant measures of the communal council become valid only after\r\nthey have received the approval of the provincial deputation, or even\r\nof the ministry at Brussels; and there are special officials, known as\r\n_commissaires d'arrondissement_, appointed by the provincial\r\ndeputation, to maintain supervision over the communes and their\r\ngoverning authorities. A fundamental characteristic, indeed, of\r\nBelgian administration is the combination of constant supervision by\r\nthe central power with a really large measure of local autonomy.[775]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 775: Dupriez, Les Ministres, 262-276; E.\r\n                   de Laveleye, Local Government and Taxation, in\r\n                   Cobden Club Essays (London, 1875).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.--SCANDINAVIA                                            (p. 553)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF DENMARK\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO 1814\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Denmark is among the smallest of European states. Its\r\narea is but 15,582 square miles, which is less than one-third of that\r\nof the state of New York, and its population, according to the returns\r\nof 1911, is but 2,775,076. The nation is one whose social experiments,\r\neconomic enterprises, and political practices abound in interest. As a\r\npower, it counts nowadays for little. Time was, however, when it\r\ncounted for much, and the developments by which the kingdom has been\r\nreduced to its present status among the nations comprise one of the\r\nremarkable chapters of modern European history.\r\n\r\n*607. Union of Kalmar, 1397.*--The maximum of Danish dominion was\r\nattained by virtue of the Union of Kalmar, in 1397, whereby the three\r\nkingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were united under the regency\r\nof Margaret, daughter of the Danish king Valdemar IV.[776] By the\r\nterms of this arrangement the native institutions and the separate\r\nadministration of each of the three states were guaranteed; and, in\r\npoint of fact, so powerless at times during succeeding generations was\r\nthe Danish sovereign in his over-sea dominions that for all practical\r\npurposes each of the three affiliated kingdoms may be regarded as\r\nhaving retained essentially its original independence. During an\r\nextended period at the middle of the fifteenth century Sweden even had\r\na king of her own. None the less, there was a form of union, and at\r\ntimes the preponderance of Denmark tended to reduce the northern\r\nnations to the status of mere dependencies. The union with Sweden\r\nlasted only a century and a quarter. Under the leadership of Gustavus\r\nVasa the Swedish people, in 1523, effectually regained their\r\nindependence, although in accordance with the Treaty of Malmö, in\r\n1524, certain of the southernmost Swedish provinces remained for a\r\ntime under Danish control.[777] It was the lot of Norway, on the   (p. 554)\r\nother hand, not alone to be brought more thoroughly into subjection to\r\nDenmark than was Sweden, but to continue under Danish sovereignty\r\nuntil 1814, and even at that date to pass instantly from the control\r\nof Denmark into that of Sweden, rather than to regain her ancient\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 776: The nominal sovereign was Margaret's\r\n                   great-nephew, Eric of Pomerania, who was elected at\r\n                   a convention of representatives of the three\r\n                   kingdoms held simultaneously with the establishment\r\n                   of the Union. Eric was deposed in 1439.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 777: R. N. Bain, Scandinavia, a Political\r\n                   History of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (Cambridge,\r\n                   1905), Chap. 3; P. B. Watson, The Swedish\r\n                   Revolution under Gustavus Vasa (London, 1889).]\r\n\r\n*608. The Loss of Norway, 1814.*--The loss of Norway by Denmark was an\r\nincident of the Napoleonic wars. During the course of those wars\r\nDenmark, as long as was practicable, maintained a policy of\r\nneutrality. But in 1807, after she had rejected an offer of a British\r\nalliance, she was attacked by a British fleet, and thereupon she\r\nbecame the firmest and most persistent of the allies of Napoleon. Thus\r\nit came about that when the contest of the powers drew to an end\r\nDenmark had the misfortune to be found upon the losing side. Sweden\r\nstood with the Allies, and the upshot was that, to compensate that\r\nnation for her loss of Finland to Russia and of Pomerania to Prussia,\r\nthe Allies gave their consent, in 1812-1813, to the dismemberment by\r\nSweden of the Danish dominion. The work was accomplished by the French\r\nmarshal Bernadotte, crown prince of Sweden (by adoption) from 1810,\r\nand later king (1818-1844). By the Treaty of Kiel, January 14, 1814,\r\nNorway was ceded perforce by Denmark to Sweden, and by the Congress of\r\nVienna, later in the year, the transfer was accorded the formal\r\napproval of the powers. The Norwegians objected and proceeded to elect\r\nas their king a Danish prince; but in the end they were compelled to\r\nsubmit. Denmark was unable to do more than make ineffectual protest.\r\n\r\n*609. Political Development: the Revolution of 1660.*--The governmental\r\nsystem with which Denmark emerged from the era of Napoleon was\r\nessentially that which had been in operation in the kingdom since the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century. Prior to a remarkable\r\nrevolution which, in 1660, followed the conclusion of a costly war\r\nwith Sweden, monarchy in Denmark was limited and almost uniformly\r\nweak. Through three hundred years the kings were elected by the\r\nRigsrad, or senate, and the conditions of their tenure were such as to\r\npreclude both the independence of action and the accumulation of\r\nresources which is essential to absolutism. As early as 1282 the\r\nnobles were able to extort from the crown a _haandfaestning_, or\r\ncharter, and almost every sovereign after that date was compelled,\r\nonce at least during his reign, to make a grant of chartered\r\nprivileges. To the Danehof, or national assembly, fell at times a  (p. 555)\r\ngoodly measure of authority, although eventually it was the Rigsrad\r\nthat procured the supreme control of the state. The national assembly\r\ncomprised the three estates of the nobles, the clergy, and the\r\nburgesses;[778] the senate was a purely aristocratic body.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 778: In the Swedish diet the peasantry\r\n                   constituted a fourth estate, but in Denmark no\r\n                   political power was possessed by this class.]\r\n\r\nIn 1660 there occurred a revolution in consequence of which the\r\nmonarchy was rehabilitated and a governmental system which long had\r\nbeen notoriously disjointed and inefficient was replaced by a system\r\nwhich, if despotic, was at least much superior to that which\r\ntheretofore had been in operation. The nobles, discredited by the\r\ncalamities which their misrule had brought upon the nation, were\r\ncompelled to give way, and the estates represented in the Danehof\r\nsurrendered, in a measure voluntarily, a considerable portion of the\r\nprivileges to which they had been accustomed to lay claim. The\r\nmonarchy was put once more upon an hereditary basis and its powers\r\nwere materially enlarged. The intent of the aggressive sovereign of\r\nthe day, Frederick III., was to proceed with caution, but not to stop\r\nhalfway. By the promulgation of two monumental documents the road was\r\nthrown open to thoroughgoing absolutism. One of these was the\r\n\"Instrument, or Pragmatic Sanction, of the King's Hereditary Right to\r\nthe Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway,\" dated January 10, 1661. The other\r\nwas the _Kongelov_, or \"King's Law,\" of November 14, 1665, a state\r\npaper which has been declared to have \"the highly dubious honor of\r\nbeing the one written law in the civilized world which fearlessly\r\ncarries out absolutism to its last consequences.\"[779] In the\r\n_Kongelov_ it was made _lèse-majesté_ in any manner to usurp or\r\ninfringe the king's absolute authority; it was asserted that the\r\nmoment the sovereign ascends the throne crown and scepter are vested\r\nin him by his own right; and the sole obligation of the king was\r\naffirmed to be to maintain the indivisibility of the realm, to\r\npreserve the Christian faith in accordance with the Augsburg\r\nConfession, and to execute faithfully all of the provisions of the\r\n_Kongelov_ itself. Such were the principles upon which, during upwards\r\nof two centuries thereafter, the government of the Danish kingdom was\r\nbased. Absolutism was all but unrelieved; but it is only fair to add\r\nthat most of the sovereigns, according to the light which they\r\npossessed, sought to govern in the interest of their subjects.[780]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 779: Bain, Scandinavia, 266.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 780: For sketches of Danish political\r\n                   history prior to 1814 see Bain, Scandinavia, Chaps.\r\n                   2, 4, 7, 10, 15; Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire\r\n                   Générale, III., Chap. 14, IV., Chap. 15; VI., Chap.\r\n                   17; VII., Chap. 23; IX., Chap. 23.

THE RISE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, 1814-1866                       (p. 556)\r\n\r\n*610. The Provincial Diets.*--Gradually after 1814 the kingdom recovered\r\nfrom the depression into which by its loss of territory and its\r\nstaggering indebtedness it had been plunged, and with the recovery\r\ncame a revived political spirit as well as a fresh economic stimulus.\r\nThe sixteen years between the Treaty of Kiel and the revolutionary\r\nyear 1830 were almost absolutely devoid of political agitation, but\r\nafter 1830 there set in, in Denmark as in most continental countries,\r\na liberal movement whose object was nothing less than the\r\nestablishment of a constitutional system of government. To meet in\r\nsome measure the demands which were made upon him, King Frederick VI.\r\ncalled into being, by decrees of 1831 and 1834, four Landtags, or\r\ndiets, one in each of the provinces of the realm--Schleswig, Holstein,\r\nJutland, and the Islands.[781] The members of these assemblies,\r\ncomprising burgesses, landowners, and peasants, were to be chosen by\r\nthe landed proprietors for a term of six years, and they were to meet\r\nbiennially for the discussion of laws and taxes and the drawing up of\r\npetitions. A few landowners, professors, and ecclesiastics were to be\r\nappointed to membership by the crown. The function of each of the four\r\nbodies was purely consultative.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 781: The ordinance establishing the\r\n                   provincial assemblies was promulgated May 28, 1831,\r\n                   but the assemblies did not come into existence\r\n                   until after the supplementary decrees of May 15,\r\n                   1834. In 1843 Iceland was granted \"home rule,\" with\r\n                   the right to maintain an independent legislature.]\r\n\r\n*611. Royal Opposition to Reform.*--From the point of view of the\r\nLiberals, whose aim was the institution of a national parliamentary\r\nsystem, the king's concession was too meager to comprise more than a\r\nbare beginning. Throughout the remainder of the reign agitation was\r\nkept up, although at the hand of a sovereign whose fundamental\r\npolitical principle was the divine right of kings, little that was\r\nmore substantial was to be expected. Christian VIII., who succeeded\r\nFrederick in December, 1839, brought with him to the throne a\r\nreputation for enlightened and progressive views. Further, however,\r\nthan to pledge himself to certain administrative reforms the new\r\nsovereign displayed scant willingness to go. One liberal project after\r\nanother was repelled, and press prosecutions and other coercive\r\nmeasures were brought to bear to discourage propaganda. It was in this\r\nperiod, however, that there arose a preponderating issue whose\r\nsettlement was destined eventually to exert a powerful influence in\r\nthe establishment of constitutional government in Denmark, i.e., the\r\nquestion of the policy to be pursued in respect to the affiliated\r\nduchies of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg.[782] During the     (p. 557)\r\nlater years of the reign successive ministries grappled vainly with\r\nthis problem, and the political forces of the kingdom came to be\r\ndivided with unprecedented sharpness by the conflict between the\r\nseparatist tendency and the demand for immediate and complete\r\nincorporation. The king himself was brought eventually to consent to\r\nthe framing of a constitution for the whole of his dominions, as a\r\nmeans of holding the realm together; but he died, January 20, 1848,\r\nbefore the task had been completed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 782: Holstein and Lauenburg were German\r\n                   in population and were members of the German\r\n                   Confederation. Southern Schleswig also was\r\n                   inhabited by German-speaking people, though the\r\n                   duchy did not belong to the Confederation.\r\n                   Schleswig and Holstein had been joined with Denmark\r\n                   under a precarious form of union since the Middle\r\n                   Ages. Lauenburg was acquired, with the assent of\r\n                   the Allies, in 1814-1815 in partial compensation\r\n                   for the loss of Norway.]\r\n\r\n*612. The Constitutions of 1848-1849.*--Within eight days the\r\nconstitution was promulgated by the new sovereign, Frederick VII.\r\nUnder its provisions there was established a parliament representative\r\nof all of the Danish dominions. Neither the Danes nor the inhabitants\r\nof the duchies, however, were satisfied, and in Holstein there broke\r\nout open rebellion. Prussia intervened in behalf of the disaffected\r\nduchies, and Great Britain and Russia in behalf of the Danish\r\nGovernment. The result was the triumph of the Government; but in the\r\nmeantime the rescript by which the common constitution had been\r\npromulgated was withdrawn. In its place was published a decree which\r\nprovided for the establishment of a bicameral national assembly\r\n(Rigsdag), of whose 152 members 38, nominated by the crown, were to\r\nform a Landsthing, or upper chamber, and the remaining 114, elected by\r\nthe people, were to comprise a Folkething, or house of representatives.\r\nIn the early summer of 1849 a constitution embodying these\r\narrangements was drawn up; and June 5, after having been adopted by\r\nthe new Rigsdag, the instrument was approved by the crown. For the\r\nmoment the question of the duchies seemed insoluble, and this second\r\nconstitution was extended to Jutland and the Islands only, i.e., to\r\nDenmark proper. Its adoption, however, is a landmark in Danish\r\nconstitutional history. Under its terms the autocracy of the\r\n_Kongelov_ was formally abandoned and in its place was substituted a\r\nlimited monarchy in which legislative powers were to be shared by the\r\ncrown with an elective diet and the executive authority was to be\r\nexercised by ministers responsible to the legislative body. As will\r\nappear, it was this constitution of June 5, 1849, that, with revision,\r\nbecame permanently the fundamental law of the kingdom.[783]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 783: Bain, Scandinavia, Chap. 16;\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chap. 24\r\n                   (bibliography, pp. 961-962); Lavisse et Rambaud,\r\n                   Histoire Générale, X., Chap. 18; C.

The Problem of the Duchies.*--Following prolonged            (p. 558)\r\ninternational conferences, there was issued, January 28, 1852, a new\r\nconstitutional decree by which it was provided that the kingdom proper\r\nand Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg should have a common\r\nconstitution for common affairs, but that each of the territories\r\nshould enjoy autonomy in the management of its separate concerns. An\r\nultra-conservative constitution which had been worked out by the\r\nRigsdag in consultation with the Landtags of the duchies, was\r\npromulgated October 2, 1855. No sooner had the instrument been put in\r\noperation, however, than stubborn opposition to its provisions arose,\r\nboth from the duchies themselves and from the interested powers of\r\nGermany. November 28, 1858, the Danish Government yielded in so far as\r\nto consent to the withdrawal of the constitution from Holstein and\r\nLauenburg. Through several years thereafter the question of the\r\nduchies overshadowed all else in Danish politics and in Danish\r\ndiplomatic relations. March 30, 1863, a royal decree recognized the\r\nessential detachment of Holstein from the monarchy and vested the\r\nlegislative power of the duchy solely in the king and the local\r\nestates. Later in the year, however, the premier Hall proposed and\r\ncarried through the Rigsdag a constitution which contemplated again\r\nthe incorporation of Schleswig with the kingdom. To this instrument\r\nthe Council of State, November 13, gave its assent, and, five days\r\nlater, with the approval of the new sovereign, Christian IX., it\r\nbecame law. So far as Denmark was concerned, the solution of the\r\nquestion of the duchies was now at hand. In the name of Prussia and\r\nAustria, Bismarck demanded summarily that the November constitution be\r\nrescinded. War ensued, and by the Treaty of Vienna, October 30, 1864,\r\nDenmark, in defeat, yielded all claim to Schleswig, Holstein, and\r\nLauenburg. After continuing for a time a bone of contention between\r\nthe leading German states, these territories were incorporated,\r\nsubsequent to the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, in the kingdom of\r\nPrussia. Denmark, shorn of a million of population and approximately\r\none-third of her territory, was reduced in power and area to\r\nsubstantially her present proportions.[784]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 784: Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chap.\r\n                   16; Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Générale, XI.,\r\n                   Chap. 12; J.

The Revised Constitution of 1866.*--The loss of the duchies, while\r\nhumiliating, cut the Gordian knot, of Danish political reconstruction.\r\nJuly 28, 1866, the constitution of July 5, 1849, in revised form,  (p. 559)\r\nwas re-issued, and this instrument continues to the present day the\r\nfundamental law of the kingdom. Its ultimate adoption was the\r\nachievement largely of the agricultural interests in the Rigsdag; but\r\nthe king, Christian IX., though not in sympathy with the parliamentary\r\nideal of government, gave it his cordial support. The constitution is\r\nan elaborate document, in ninety-five articles. In addition to the\r\ncustomary specifications relating to the executive, legislative, and\r\njudicial departments of the government, it contains a wide variety of\r\nguarantees respecting religion, freedom of speech and of the press,\r\nliberty of assemblage and of petition, and uniformity of judicial\r\nprocedure, which, taken together, comprise a very substantial bill of\r\nrights.[785] The method of its amendment is not materially unlike that\r\nprevailing in Holland, Belgium, and a number of other continental\r\ncountries. Proposals regarding alterations or additions may be\r\nsubmitted at any time within either branch of the Rigsdag. In the\r\nevent of the adoption of a proposal of the kind by both chambers, it\r\nbecomes the duty of the Government, provided it favors the change, to\r\ndissolve the Rigsdag and to order a general election. If the newly\r\nchosen Rigsdag adopts the proposed amendment without change and the\r\ncrown formally approves it, the modification goes forthwith into\r\neffect.[786] Constitutional amendments since 1866 have been, however,\r\nneither numerous nor important.[787]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 785: Arts. 80-94.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*615. The King: Status and Powers.*--The form of the Danish government\r\nis declared by the constitution to be that of a limited monarchy.[788]\r\nThe throne is hereditary, and the succession is regulated by a law of\r\nJuly 31, 1853, adopted in pursuance of the Treaty of London of May (p. 560)\r\n8, 1852, wherein the powers bestowed the Danish succession upon Prince\r\nChristian, of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and the direct\r\nmale descendants of his union with the Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel,\r\nniece of Christian VIII. of Denmark.[789] By the constitution it is\r\nrequired of the king that he shall not become the ruler of any country\r\nother than Denmark without the consent of the Rigsdag, that he shall\r\nbelong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church (the national church of\r\nDenmark, supported by the state), and that before assuming the throne\r\nhe shall give in writing before the Council of State an assurance,\r\nunder oath, that he will maintain inviolate the constitution of the\r\nkingdom.[790] The royal civil list is fixed by law for the term of the\r\nreign. That of the present sovereign, Frederick VIII., is one million\r\nkroner annually.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 788: Art. 1. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 267.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 789: Prince Christian became, in 1863,\r\n                   King Christian IX.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 790: One original text of this pledge\r\n                   must be preserved in the archives of the crown,\r\n                   another in those of the Rigsdag. Art. 7. Dodd,\r\n                   Modern Constitutions, I., 267.]\r\n\r\nThe powers of the king are comprehensive. Within the limitations\r\nprescribed by the constitution, he exercises \"supreme authority over\r\nall the affairs of the kingdom.\" He appoints to all offices, dismisses\r\nfrom office, and transfers from one office to another. He declares war\r\nand makes peace. He concludes and terminates treaties of alliance and\r\nof commerce, on condition only that an agreement which involves a\r\ncession of territory or a change of existing international relations\r\nmust receive the assent of the Rigsdag. He exercises the power of\r\npardon and of amnesty, save that without the consent of the Folkething\r\nhe may not relieve ministers of penalties arising from impeachment\r\nproceedings. He grants such licenses and exemptions from the laws as\r\nare authorized by statute. He convenes the Rigsdag in regular session\r\nannually and in extraordinary session at will, adjourns it, and\r\ndissolves either or both of the houses. He may submit to it projects\r\nfor consideration or drafts of laws, and his consent is necessary to\r\nimpart legal character to any of the measures which it enacts. He\r\norders the publication of statutes and sees that they are executed.\r\nFinally, when the need is urgent and the Rigsdag is not in session, he\r\nmay promulgate ordinances, provided, first, that they are not contrary\r\nto the constitution, and, second, that they are laid before the\r\nRigsdag at its ensuing meeting.\r\n\r\n*616. The Ministry and the Parliamentary System.*--For the measures of\r\nthe government the king is not personally responsible. His powers are\r\nexercised through ministers, who are appointed and may be removed by\r\nhim, and whose number and functions are left to his determination. The\r\nministries are nine in number, as follows: Foreign Affairs,        (p. 561)\r\nInterior, Justice, Finance, Commerce, Defense, Agriculture, Public\r\nWorks, and Public Instruction and Ecclesiastical Affairs. Collectively\r\nthe ministers form the Council of State, over which the king presides\r\nand in which the heir to the throne, if of age, is entitled to a seat.\r\nAll laws and important public matters are apt normally to be discussed\r\nin the Council of State. There is also, however, a Council of\r\nMinisters, consisting simply of the nine heads of departments under\r\nthe presidency of an additional minister designated by the crown, and\r\nto this body are referred in practice many minor subjects that call\r\nfor consideration.\r\n\r\nThe ministers, so the constitution affirms, are responsible for the\r\nconduct of the government.[791] The king's signature of a measure\r\ngives it legal character only if accompanied by the signature of one\r\nor more of the ministers, and ministers may be called to account by\r\nthe Folkething, as well as by the king, for their conduct in office.\r\nThere is, furthermore, a special Court of Impeachment for the trial of\r\nministers against whom charges are brought. On the surface, these\r\narrangements seem to imply the existence of a parliamentary system of\r\ngovernment, with a ministry answerable singly and collectively to the\r\npopular legislative chamber. In point of fact, however, there has been\r\nall the while much less parliamentarism in Denmark than seemingly is\r\ncontemplated in the constitution, and it is hardly too much to say\r\nthat since the adoption of the present constitution the most\r\ninterminable of political controversies in the kingdom has been that\r\ncentering about the question of the responsibility of ministers. Until\r\nat least within the past decade, the practice of the crown has been\r\nregularly to appoint ministers independently and to maintain them in\r\noffice in disregard of, and even in defiance of, the wishes of the\r\npopular branch of the legislature. The desire of the Liberals has been\r\nto inaugurate a thoroughgoing parliamentary régime, under which the\r\nsovereign should be obligated to select his ministers from the party\r\nin control of the Folkething and the ministers, in turn, should be\r\nresponsible to the Folkething, in fact as well as in theory, for all\r\nof their official acts. Throughout the prolonged period covered by the\r\nministry of Jakob Estrup (1875-1894) the conflict upon this issue was\r\nincessant. During the whole of the period Estrup and his colleagues\r\ncommanded the support of a majority in the Landsthing, but were\r\naccorded the votes of only a minority in the lower chamber. After the\r\nelections of 1884, indeed, the Government could rely upon a total of\r\nnot more than nineteen votes in that chamber.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 791: Art. 12. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 268.]\r\n\r\n*617. The Establishment of Ministerial Responsibility.*--Under the\r\ncontinued stress of this situation constitutionalism broke down    (p. 562)\r\ncompletely. The Government, finding its projects of military and\r\nnaval reform persistently thwarted and its budgets rejected, stretched\r\nits prerogatives beyond all warrant of law. Provisional measures, in\r\nthe form of royal ordinances, and arbitrary decisions multiplied, and\r\nbudgets were adopted and carried into execution without so much as the\r\nform of parliamentary sanction. In time the forces of opposition fell\r\ninto disagreement and the more moderate element was brought to the\r\npoint of compromise. Between the Conservatives and the National\r\nLiberals, on the one hand, by whom the Government had been supported,\r\nand the conciliatory element of the Liberal opposition, on the other,\r\na truce was arranged, and in 1894, for the first time in nine years,\r\nit was found possible to enact the annual finance law in regular\r\nmanner. In this same year Estrup's retirement cleared the way for the\r\nappointment of a moderate Conservative ministry. Under Estrup's\r\nsuccessors the conflict was continued, but not so vigorously as\r\nbefore. More and more the political center of gravity shifted to the\r\nFolkething, and when the general elections of 1901 returned to that\r\nbody an overwhelming majority of Liberals, Christian IX. was at last\r\ncompelled to give way and to call into being a Liberal (\"Left Reform\")\r\nministry. It is too much to say that the parliamentary system is as\r\nyet completely established in Denmark. There is, however, a closer\r\napproximation to it than ever before, and there is every prospect of\r\nthe ultimate and thorough triumph of the essential parliamentary\r\nprinciple. In 1908, and again in 1909, a ministry was virtually forced\r\nto resign by the pressure of parliamentary opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE RIGSDAG--POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*618. The Landsthing.*--The Rigsdag is composed of two chambers--the\r\nLandsthing, or Senate, and the Folkething, or House of Representatives.\r\nThe Landsthing consists of 66 members, of whom 12 are appointed by the\r\nking, seven are elected in Copenhagen, 45 are elected in the larger\r\nelectoral divisions comprising rural districts and towns, one is\r\nelected in Bornholm, and one is chosen by the Lagthing of the Faröe\r\nIslands.[792] The king's appointment of members is made for life, from\r\namong active or former members of the Folkething. Elected members\r\nserve regularly eight years, one-half retiring every four years. The\r\nseven members for Copenhagen are chosen by an electoral college\r\ncomposed of (1) electors chosen by all citizens who are entitled   (p. 563)\r\nto vote for members of the Folkething, in the ratio of one elector for\r\nevery 120 voters or major fraction thereof, and (2) an equal number of\r\nelectors chosen by the voters who, during the preceding year, have\r\nbeen assessed upon a taxable income of not less than 2,000\r\nrix-dollars. The members elected from the rural districts and towns\r\nare chosen indirectly, after a manner analogous to that in operation\r\nin the capital.[793] The result is a very successful combination of\r\nthe principles of indirect popular election and indirect\r\nrepresentation of property. In all cases the election of members takes\r\nplace according to the principles of proportional representation.[794]\r\nEvery person eligible to the Folkething is eligible to the Landsthing,\r\nprovided he has resided in his electoral circle, or district, during\r\nthe year preceding his election.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 792: Art. 34. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 272. The status of the Faröe Islands is that of\r\n                   an integral portion of the kingdom, not that of a\r\n                   dependency. It is analogous to the status of\r\n                   Algeria in the French Republic. No other outlying\r\n                   Danish territory is represented in the Rigsdag.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 793: For details see Art. 37 of the\r\n                   constitution. Dodd, Modern Constitutions, I., 272.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 794: It is of interest to observe that\r\n                   Denmark was the first nation to make use of a\r\n                   system of proportional representation. The\r\n                   principle was introduced originally as early as\r\n                   1855, in the constitution promulgated in that year,\r\n                   and it was retained through the constitutional\r\n                   changes of 1863 and 1866, although its application\r\n                   was restricted to the election of members of the\r\n                   upper chamber. An account of its introduction is\r\n                   contained in La représentation proportionnelle\r\n                   (Paris, 1888), published by the French Society for\r\n                   the Study of Proportional Representation.]\r\n\r\n*619. The Folkething.*--The Folkething is composed of deputies chosen\r\ndirectly by manhood suffrage for a term of three years. By the\r\nconstitution it is stipulated that as nearly as practicable there\r\nshall be one member for every 16,000 inhabitants. In point of fact,\r\nthe total membership of the Chamber is but 114, whereas at the ratio\r\nindicated it should be upwards of 170. Deputies are elected by secret\r\nballot (since 1901), in single-member districts. The franchise is\r\nextended to all male citizens of good reputation who have attained the\r\nage of thirty years, except those who are in actual receipt of public\r\ncharity, those who have at one time been recipients of public charity\r\nand have rendered no reimbursement therefor, those who are in private\r\nservice and have no independent household establishment, and those who\r\nare not in control of their own property. The voter must have resided\r\na minimum of one year in the circle in which he proposes to vote.[795]\r\nWith the exception of non-householders in private service, of persons\r\nunder guardianship, and of recipients of public charity, all male\r\ncitizens who have completed their twenty-fifth year are qualified for\r\nelection. Curiously enough, it is thus possible for a citizen to\r\nbecome a member of the Folkething before he is old enough to vote at a\r\nnational election. Members of both chambers receive, in addition to\r\ntravelling expenses, regular payment for their services at the     (p. 564)\r\nrate of ten kroner per day during the first six months of a session,\r\nand six kroner for each day thereafter.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 795: Art. 30. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 271.]\r\n\r\nDuring recent years there has been no small amount of agitation in\r\nbehalf of a more democratic electoral system. In April, 1908, there\r\nwas enacted an important piece of legislation whereby the franchise in\r\nmunicipal elections was conferred upon all resident taxpayers of the\r\nage of twenty-five, men and women alike; and, beginning with the\r\nelections of 1909, women have both voted and held office regularly\r\nwithin the municipalities. By the legislation of 1908 the number of\r\npersons qualified to vote at local elections was practically doubled.\r\nEarly in 1910 a measure was passed in the Folkething whereby the age\r\nlimit for voters in parliamentary elections was reduced from thirty to\r\ntwenty-five years and the suffrage was conferred upon women and upon\r\npersons engaged in service. This measure did not become law, but in\r\nthe Folkething elected May 20 of the same year Premier Berntsen\r\nintroduced a new bill of essentially the same nature. The question of\r\nproportional representation was deferred, the bill providing for (1)\r\nthe reduction of the voting age to twenty-five; (2) the increase of\r\nthe number of deputies to 132; and (3) the extension of the suffrage\r\nin national elections to women, together with eligibility for seats in\r\nboth of the legislative chambers. This measure likewise failed; but at\r\nthe opening of Parliament in October, 1912, fresh proposals upon the\r\nsubject were introduced.\r\n\r\n*620. The Rigsdag: Sessions and Powers.*--The Rigsdag is required to\r\nmeet in regular session on the first Monday in October of every year.\r\nEach house determines the validity of the election of its members;\r\neach makes its own regulations concerning its order of business and\r\nthe maintenance of discipline; each elects its own president,\r\nvice-presidents, and other officers. Each has the right to propose\r\nbills, each may present addresses to the king, and the consent of each\r\nis necessary to the enactment of any law. By provision of the\r\nconstitution the annual budget must be laid on the table of the\r\nFolkething at the beginning of each regular session, and no tax may be\r\nimposed, altered, or abolished save by law. Each house is required to\r\nappoint two salaried auditors whose business it is to examine the\r\nyearly public accounts and to determine whether there have been either\r\nunrecorded revenues or unauthorized expenditures. For the adjustment\r\nof conflicts between the two chambers there is provided a method\r\nwhereby there may be constituted a joint conference committee similar\r\nto that employed under like circumstances in the American Congress.[796]\r\nSessions are public, and a majority of the membership constitutes  (p. 565)\r\na quorum. With the consent of the house to which he belongs, any\r\nmember may propose subjects for consideration and may request\r\nexplanations from the Government concerning them. Ministers are\r\nentitled to appear and to speak in either chamber as often as they may\r\ndesire, provided they do not otherwise infringe upon the order of\r\nbusiness. By reason of the uncertain status of ministerial\r\nresponsibility the right of interpellation means as yet but little in\r\npractice. The minister may or may not reply to inquiries, and in any\r\ncase he is not obliged by unfavorable opinion or an adverse vote to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 796: Art. 53. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   I., 274.]\r\n\r\n*621. Political Parties: the Ministry of Estrup, 1875-1894.*--Prior to\r\n1848 the preponderating public issues of Denmark were concerned\r\nchiefly with the introduction in the kingdom of a constitutional type\r\nof government. Between 1848 and 1864, they related all but exclusively\r\nto the status of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg.\r\nDuring the closing quarter of the past century they centered\r\nprincipally in the titanic conflict which a growing and indomitable\r\nmajority in the Folkething, representing a no less determined majority\r\nof the nation, waged with King Christian IX. and his advisers in\r\nbehalf of the enforcement of constitutional limitations upon the crown\r\nand of ministerial responsibility to the national legislative body.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged struggle between the Government and the parliamentary\r\nmajority had its beginning in 1872, when the various radical groups in\r\nthe Folkething, drawing together under the designation of the United\r\nLeft, rejected a proposed budget and passed a vote of want of\r\nconfidence in the Conservative Government. The avowed purpose of the\r\ndisaffected elements was to force the ministry of Holstein of\r\nHolsteinborg to retire, to compel the sovereign to select his\r\nministers from the parliamentary majority, and to enforce the\r\nprinciple of ministerial responsibility to the lower legislative\r\nchamber. Supported by the king and the Landsthing, however, the\r\nministry refused to resign. June 11, 1875, there was called to the\r\npremiership an able and aggressive statesman, Jakob Estrup, who\r\nthrough the next nineteen years continuously maintained the\r\nGovernment's position against the most desperate of parliamentary\r\nassaults. During the whole of this period Estrup commanded the support\r\nof the Landsthing, but was opposed by large majorities in the\r\nFolkething and throughout the country. The struggle raged principally\r\nupon questions of finance. Estrup, who retained for himself the\r\nportfolio of finance, was bent upon the strengthening of Danish\r\narmaments, and over the protest of the Folkething huge budgets were\r\nput into effect again and again by simple ordinance of the crown. From\r\n1882 onwards ordinary legislation was at a standstill, and during  (p. 566)\r\nnine years after 1885 there was not one legal grant of supplies. The\r\nconstitution was reduced well nigh to waste paper.\r\n\r\n*622. Later Conservative Governments: the Triumph of the Left.*--In 1886\r\nthe Radicals, despairing of overthrowing the Estrup government by\r\nobstruction, resorted for the first time to negotiation. Not until\r\nApril 1, 1894, however, was the parliamentary majority able to agree\r\nwith the Government and the Landsthing upon a budget which, by being\r\nmade retroactive, legalized the irregular fiscal expedients of the\r\npast two decades. In August of the same year Estrup was succeeded in\r\nthe premiership by Reedtz-Thott who, although a Conservative, and\r\nhence a supporter of the Government's position, was more favorable to\r\nconciliation than had been his predecessor. The struggle, however, was\r\nby no means ended. The elections of 1895 and of 1898 resulted in\r\ndecisive victories for the Liberals and Radicals, and in the Chamber\r\nthe Government was confronted by an overwhelming majority comprising a\r\nModerate Left, a Reform or Radical Left, and a group of Social\r\nDemocrats. Even in the Landsthing the Government's hold was growing\r\nless substantial. Reedtz-Thott, none the less, clung to office until\r\nDecember, 1899, and after his retirement there followed two more\r\nConservative ministries--those of Hörring (December, 1899, to April,\r\n1900) and of Sehested (April, 1900, to July, 1901).\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1901, occurred the most notable political event in a\r\nhalf-century of Danish history. Confronted by a majority of 106 to 8\r\nin the Folkething, besieged by widespread popular opinion, and\r\npossessing no longer a dependable majority in the Landsthing, the aged\r\nChristian IX. gave way, with such grace as he could muster, and\r\nsummoned to the premiership Professor Deuntzer, by whom was\r\nconstituted a pure Left Reform ministry. At the partial elections of\r\nSeptember 19, 1902, the Conservatives lost absolutely their majority\r\nin the upper chamber, while in the Folkething party strength was so\r\nredistributed that, while the Conservatives retained their eight\r\nseats, the Social Democrats acquired fourteen and the Left Reform\r\nparty seventy-seven. The elections of June 16, 1903, wrought but\r\ninsignificant changes of status.\r\n\r\n*623. The Christensen Ministry (1905-1908) and the Elections of\r\n1906.*--As was to be expected of a party whose rôle had been regularly\r\none of mere opposition, the Left Reform, after gaining office,\r\ndeveloped a certain amount of internal discord. In January, 1905, the\r\nDeuntzer ministry broke up and a more homogeneous and moderate cabinet\r\nwas organized under the Left Reform leader Christensen. This ministry\r\ncontrived to retain office until October, 1908. At the elections of\r\nMay 29, 1906, the Government took its stand upon manhood suffrage  (p. 567)\r\nin parliamentary elections, equal suffrage in municipal elections (in\r\naccordance with the principle of proportional representation) for all\r\ntaxpayers, and the reform of both the administrative and judicial\r\nsystems. Its bitterest opponents were its former allies, the Radical\r\nLeft (which had split off from the Left Reform party after the\r\nformation of the Christensen ministry) and the Social Democrats,\r\nthough neither of these parties put forward a programme which was in\r\nany measure specific. After an unusually spirited contest the\r\nGovernment was found to have lost three seats, the Social Democrats to\r\nhave gained eight, the Radical Left to have lost four, and the\r\nConservatives to have gained two. The resulting grouping in the\r\nFolkething was as follows: Left Reform (Ministerialists), 55; Moderate\r\nLeft, 9; Radical Left, 9; Social Democrats, 24; Conservatives, 13;\r\nIndependents, 3; member for Faröe Islands, 1. At the partial renewal\r\nof the Landsthing in September, 1906, the Government lost five seats,\r\nand with them the majority which, aided by the Moderate Left and the\r\nFree Conservatives,[797] it had been able since 1901 to control. The\r\nconsequence of its losses was that the Christensen ministry drew\r\nappreciably toward the Conservative elements of the Rigsdag, as\r\nagainst the Radicals and Socialists.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 797: A group which, after the formation\r\n                   of the Deuntzer ministry, split off from the\r\n                   Conservatives in the upper chamber.]\r\n\r\n*624. Ministerial Instability, 1908-1912.*--October 11, 1908, largely by\r\nreason of the scandal in which it was involved by the embezzlements of\r\nthe minister of the interior Alberti, the ministry of Christensen was\r\nreplaced by a cabinet formed by Neergaard. It in turn retired, July\r\n31, 1909, defeated upon bills to which it was committed for the\r\nstrengthening of the national fortifications. The Holstein-Ledreborg\r\nministry which succeeded was able to secure the passage of the bills,\r\nbut, October 22, 1909, it was forced out on a vote of want of\r\nconfidence. At the election of May 25, 1909, in which the military\r\nbills comprised the principal issue, the Left Reform government had\r\ncontinued to lose ground, while the Radicals (though not the Social\r\nDemocrats) and the Conservatives had gained. October 28, 1909, a new\r\nministry was formed by the Radical leader Zahle. In the Folkething the\r\nRadicals possessed 20 seats only, but with the aid of the Social\r\nDemocrats, possessing 24, they hoped to be able to attain some measure\r\nof success. The hope proved vain. April 18, 1910, the Folkething was\r\ndissolved, and there followed another spirited campaign in which the\r\nmilitary question was preponderant. The Radical government, with its\r\nSocialist allies, went before the country on a platform which proposed\r\nthe repeal of the defense measures passed during the previous      (p. 568)\r\nyear. But at the elections of May 20 both Radicals and Social Democrats\r\nobtained precisely the respective number of seats which they had\r\nbefore possessed, while 69 deputies were returned by the groups which\r\nwere favorable to the execution of the contested measures. July 1, the\r\nZahle ministry resigned and was succeeded by a cabinet formed by Klaus\r\nBerntsen, leader of the Moderate Left. The new ministry, although\r\ndrawn exclusively from the Left, was well received by the Conservatives,\r\nwho pledged it their continued support against the Radical-Socialist\r\ncoalition.[798]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 798: The salient facts relating to the\r\n                   political history of Denmark since 1870 may be\r\n                   gleaned from the successive volumes of the _Annual\r\n                   Register_.

General Principles: the Courts.*--In the Danish constitution there\r\nare laid down a number of general principles with respect to the\r\njudicial branch of the government, but the organization of the courts\r\nis left almost entirely to be regulated by law. It is stipulated that\r\njudges, who are appointed by the crown, may not be dismissed except in\r\nconsequence of judicial sentence, nor transferred against their wishes\r\nfrom one tribunal to another, unless in the event of a reorganization\r\nof the courts;[799] that they shall exercise their functions strictly\r\nin compliance with law; that in criminal cases and cases involving\r\npolitical offenses trial shall be by jury; that in the administration\r\nof justice there shall be, so far as practicable, publicity and oral\r\nprocedure; and that it shall be within the competence of the courts to\r\ndecide all questions relative to the extent of the powers of the\r\npublic officials.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 799: At the age of sixty-five they may be\r\n                   retired on full salary.]\r\n\r\nThe tribunals that have been established by law comprise, beginning at\r\nthe bottom, the magistracies of the _herreds_, or hundreds, and the\r\njusticeships of the towns; a superior court (_Overret_), with nine\r\njudges, at Viborg, and another, with twenty judges, at Copenhagen; and\r\na Supreme Court (_Höjesteret_), with a chief justice, twelve associate\r\njudges, and eleven special judges, at Copenhagen. Of hundred\r\nmagistrates (_herredsfogder_) and town justices (_byfogder_) there\r\nare, in all, 126. Appeal in both civil and criminal cases lies from\r\nthem to the superior courts, and thence to the supreme tribunal. There\r\nis, in addition, a Court of Impeachment (_Rigsret_), composed of the\r\nmembers of the Supreme Court, together with an equal number of     (p. 569)\r\nmembers of the Landsthing elected by that body as judges for a term\r\nof four years. The principal function of this tribunal is the trial of\r\ncharges brought against ministers by the king or by the\r\nFolkething.[800]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 800: Arts. 68-74. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, I., 276-277.]\r\n\r\n*626. The Administration of Justice Act, 1908.*--In May, 1908, a\r\nlong-standing demand of the more progressive jurists was met in part\r\nby the passage of an elaborate Administration of Justice bill, whereby\r\nthere was carried further than previously the separation of the\r\ngeneral administrative system of the kingdom from the administration\r\nof justice. Not until the enactment of this measure were the\r\nconstitutional guarantees of jury trial, publicity of judicial\r\nproceedings, and the independence of the judiciary put effectively in\r\nforce. Curiously enough, the drafting and advocacy of the bill fell\r\nprincipally to a minister, Alberti, who was on the point of being\r\nproved one of the most deliberate criminals of the generation. The\r\nmeasure, which comprised 1,015 clauses, introduced no modification in\r\nthe existing hierarchy of tribunals, but it readjusted in detail the\r\nfunctions of the several courts and defined more specifically the\r\nprocedure to be employed in the trial of various kinds of cases. One\r\nprovision which it contains is that a jury shall consist of twelve\r\nmen, that any person who is eligible for election to the Folkething is\r\neligible for selection as a juryman, and that jury service is\r\nobligatory. On the ground that it fell short of fulfilling the\r\nessential pledges of the constitution, the Radical and Socialist\r\nmembers of the Rigsdag vigorously opposed the measure.[801]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 801: The bill was carried in the\r\n                   Folkething by a vote of 57 to 42; in the Landsthing\r\n                   by a vote of 38 to 5.]\r\n\r\n*627. Local Government.*--For administrative purposes the kingdom is\r\ndivided into 18 Amter, or counties. In each is an Amtmand, or\r\ngovernor, who is appointed by the crown, and an Amtsrad, or council,\r\ncomposed of members elected indirectly within the county. The counties\r\nare divided into hundreds, which exist principally for judicial\r\npurposes, and the hundreds are divided into some 1,100 parishes. In\r\neach town is a burgomaster, who is appointed by the crown, and who\r\ngoverns with or without the assistance of aldermen. Copenhagen,\r\nhowever, has an administrative system peculiar to itself. Its\r\nburgomaster, elected by the town council, is merely confirmed by the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI                                                       (p. 570)\r\n\r\nTHE SWEDISH-NORWEGIAN UNION AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT TO 1814\r\n\r\n*628. Sweden in Earlier Modern Times.*--During the centuries which\r\nintervened between the establishment of national independence under\r\nthe leadership of Gustavus Vasa in 1523 and the end of the Napoleonic\r\nera, the political system of the kingdom of Sweden oscillated in a\r\nremarkable manner between absolutism and liberalism. The establishment\r\nof a national parliamentary assembly antedated the period of union\r\nwith Denmark (1397-1523); for it was in 1359 that King Magnus,\r\nembarrassed by the unmanageableness of the nobility and obliged to\r\nfall back upon the support of the middle classes, summoned\r\nrepresentatives of the towns to appear before the king along with the\r\nnobles and clergy, and thus constituted the first Swedish Riksdag. By\r\nan ordinance of Gustavus Adolphus in 1617, what had been a turbulent\r\nand ill-organized body was transformed into a well-ordered national\r\nassembly of four estates--the nobles, the clergy, the burghers, and\r\nthe peasants--each of which met and deliberated regularly apart from\r\nthe others. There was likewise a Rigsrad, or senate, which comprised\r\noriginally a grand council representative of the semi-feudal landed\r\naristocracy, but which by the seventeenth century had come to be\r\nessentially a bureaucracy occupying the chief offices of state at the\r\npleasure of the crown. Under Gustavus Adolphus and his earlier\r\nsuccessors, especially Charles XI. (1660-1697), however, the\r\ngovernment took on the character of at least a semi-absolutism. The\r\nRigsdag retained the right to be consulted upon important foreign and\r\nlegislative questions, but the power of initiative was exercised by\r\nthe sovereign alone. The Riksdag of 1680 admitted that the king was\r\nresponsible for his acts only to God, and that between him and his\r\npeople no intermediary was needed; and in 1682 the same body\r\nrecognized as vested in the crown the right freely to interpret and\r\namend the law.[802]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 802: Bain, Scandinavia, Chaps. 8, 11;\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, IV.

Weakness of the Monarchy in the Eighteenth Century.*--A new  (p. 571)\r\nchapter in Swedish constitutional history was inaugurated by the\r\ncalamities incident to the turbulent reign of the Mad King of the\r\nNorth, Charles XII. (1697-1718), and the Great Northern War, brought\r\nto a culmination by the cession to Russia in the Peace of Nystad,\r\nAugust 30, 1721, of all the Baltic provinces which Sweden had\r\npossessed. Early in the reign of Frederick I. (1720-1751), chiefly by\r\nlaws of 1720-1723, the government was converted into one of the most\r\nlimited of monarchies in Europe. The sovereign was reduced, indeed, to\r\na mere puppet, his principal function being that of presiding over the\r\ndeliberations of the Rigsrad. Virtually all power was vested in the\r\nRiksdag. A secret committee representative of the four estates\r\nprepared all measures, controlled foreign relations, and appointed all\r\nministers, and laws of every kind were enacted by the affirmative vote\r\nof three of the four orders. The constitutional system, while\r\nnominally monarchical, became essentially republican. In operation,\r\nhowever, it was hopelessly cumbersome, and throughout half a century\r\nthe political activities of the kingdom comprised little more than a\r\nwearisome struggle of rival factions.[803]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 803: Bain, Scandinavia, Chaps. 12-13;\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, V., Chaps. 18-19; Lavisse\r\n                   et Rambaud, Histoire Générale, VI., Chap. 17.]\r\n\r\nUnder Gustavus III. (1771-1792), nephew of Frederick the Great of\r\nPrussia, the pendulum swung back again distinctly toward absolutism.\r\nThe Riksdag, according to its custom, sought at the opening of the\r\nreign to impose upon the new sovereign a renunciatory coronation oath.\r\nGustavus, however, raised objection, and the contest became so keen\r\nthat the king resolved upon a _coup d'état_ whereby to accomplish a\r\nrestoration of the pristine independence and vigor of the royal\r\noffice. The plan was laid with care and was executed with complete\r\nsuccess. August 20, 1772, there was forced upon the estates, almost at\r\nthe bayonet's point, a constitution which had been contrived\r\nspecifically to transform the weak and disjointed quasi-republic into\r\na compact monarchy. The monarchy was to be limited, it is true, but\r\nthe framework of the state was so reconstructed that the balance of\r\npower was certain to incline toward the crown. Without the approval of\r\nthe Riksdag no law might be enacted and no tax levied; but the estates\r\nmight be summoned and dismissed freely by the king, and in him was\r\nvested exclusively the power of legislative initiative. Under this\r\ninstrument the government of Gustavus III., and in even a larger\r\nmeasure that of Gustavus IV. (1792-1809),[804] was pronouncedly\r\nautocratic.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 804: Gustavus IV., being a minor at his\r\n                   accession, did not assume control of the government\r\n                   until November 1, 1796.]\r\n\r\n*630. Sweden in the Napoleonic Period.*--Sweden is one of the      (p. 572)\r\nmany European nations which in the course of the Napoleonic period\r\nacquired a new constitutional system, but one of the few in which the\r\nfundamentals of the system at that time established have been\r\nmaintained continuously to the present day. Sweden was drawn into the\r\nNapoleonic wars at an early stage of their progress. December 3, 1804,\r\nGustavus IV. cast in his fortunes on the side of the foes of France,\r\nand although in 1806-1807 Napoleon sought to detach him from the\r\nAllies, all effort in that direction failed. The position of Gustavus,\r\nhowever, was undermined in his own country by his failure to defend\r\nFinland on the occasion of the Russian invasion of 1808, and March 29,\r\n1809, yielding to popular pressure, and hoping to save the crown for\r\nhis son, he abdicated. By the Riksdag the royal title, withheld from\r\nthe young Prince Gustavus, was bestowed upon the eldest brother of\r\nGustavus III., who, under the name of Charles XIII., was proclaimed\r\nJune 5. On the same day the Riksdag ratified formally an elaborate\r\n_regerings-formen_, or fundamental law, which, amended from time to\r\ntime, has been preserved to the present day as the constitution of the\r\nkingdom.[805]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 805: See p. 589. Bain, Scandinavia, Chap.\r\n                   14; Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Générale, VII.,\r\n                   Chap. 23; VIII., Chap. 23.]\r\n\r\n*631. Constitutional Development of Norway to 1814.*--During more than\r\nfour centuries, from the Union of Kalmar, in 1397, to the Treaty of\r\nKiel, January 14, 1814, Norway was continuously subordinated more or\r\nless completely to Denmark. The political history and constitutional\r\ndevelopment of the nation, therefore, had little opportunity to move\r\nin normal channels. Prior to the Union the royal power was\r\nconsiderable, and at times virtually absolute, although an ever\r\npresent obstacle to the consolidation of the monarchy was the\r\nindependent spirit of the nobility. By the fourteenth century,\r\nhowever, the old landed aristocracy, decimated by civil war and\r\nimpoverished by the loss of the fur trade to Russia, had been so\r\nweakened that it no longer endangered in any degree the royal\r\nsupremacy. From the end of the thirteenth century we hear of a\r\n_palliment_, or parliament, which was summoned occasionally at the\r\npleasure of the king. But at no time had this gathering assumed the\r\ncharacter of an established national legislative body.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of political status the history of Norway under\r\nthe Union falls into four fairly clearly marked periods. The first,\r\nextending from 1397 to the accession of Christian I. in 1450,\r\nculminated in an unsuccessful attempt on the part of the Norwegians to\r\nthrow off the Danish yoke. The second, extending from 1450 to the\r\nrecognition of Frederick I. as king in Norway in 1524, was marked  (p. 573)\r\nby a still closer union between the two kingdoms. The third, beginning\r\nwith the accession of Frederick and closing with the Danish revolution\r\nof 1660, was a period in which, largely in consequence of the\r\nProtestant Revolt, Norway was reduced virtually to the level of a\r\nsubjugated province. The fourth, inaugurated by the rehabilitation of\r\nthe monarchy in Denmark in 1660, witnessed the raising of Norway from\r\nthe status of subjection to the rank of a sovereign, hereditary\r\nkingdom on a footing of approximate equality with Denmark. The period\r\nclosed with a widespread revival of the nationalist spirit, one of the\r\nfirst fruits of which was the obtaining, in 1807, of an administrative\r\nsystem separate from that of Denmark and, in 1811, of the privilege of\r\nfounding at Christiania a national university.[806]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 806: Bain, Scandinavia, Chaps. 4, 5, 7,\r\n                   10, 15; H. H. Boyesen, A History of Norway from the\r\n                   Earliest Times (2d ed., London, 1900).]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SWEDISH-NORWEGIAN UNION, 1814-1905\r\n\r\n*632. Bernadotte and the Treaty of Kiel.*--As has been pointed out, the\r\nkingdom of Sweden acquired independence of Denmark near the end of the\r\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth century. The liberation of Norway was\r\ndelayed until the era of Napoleon, and when it came it meant, not the\r\nindependence which the Norwegians craved, but forced affiliation with\r\ntheir more numerous and more powerful neighbors on the east. The\r\nsuccession of events by which the new arrangement was brought about\r\nwas engineered principally by Napoleon's ex-marshal Bernadotte. May\r\n28, 1810, Prince Charles Augustus of Augustenburg, whom the Riksdag\r\nhad selected as heir to the infirm and childless Charles XIII., died,\r\nand after a notable contest, Bernadotte was agreed upon unanimously by\r\nthe four estates (August 21) as the new heir. November 5 the\r\nadventuresome Frenchman received the homage of the estates and was\r\nadopted by the king as crown prince under the name of Charles\r\nJohn.[807] By reason of the infirmity of the sovereign, Bernadotte\r\nacquired almost at once virtual control of the government. From the\r\noutset he believed it to be impossible for Sweden to recover Finland;\r\nbut he believed no less that she might recoup herself, with the assent\r\nof the powers, by the acquisition of the Danish dominion of Norway. In\r\nMarch and April, 1813, Great Britain and Russia were brought to the\r\npoint of giving the desired assent, and by the Treaty of Kiel, January\r\n14, 1814, the king of Denmark, under pressure applied by the       (p. 574)\r\nAllies, made the desired surrender.[808]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 807: Upon the death of Charles XIII.,\r\n                   February 5, 1818, the \"prince\" succeeded to the\r\n                   throne under the name of Charles XIV. He reigned\r\n                   until 1844.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 808: C. Schefer, Bernadotte roi (Paris,\r\n                   1899); L. Pingaud, Bernadotte, Napoléon, et les\r\n                   Bourbons (Paris, 1901); G. R. Lagerhjelm, Napoleon\r\n                   och Carl Johan, 1813 (Stockholm, 1891).]\r\n\r\n*633. The Movement for Norwegian Independence: the Constitution of\r\n1814.*--In Norway there was small disposition to accept the new\r\narrangement. Instead there was set up the theory that when the Danish\r\nsovereign renounced his claim to the throne of his northern dominion\r\nthe Norwegian state legally reverted forthwith to its former condition\r\nof independence. Upon this assumption 112 representatives of the\r\nnation, of whom 82 were opposed to union with Sweden, met at the\r\nEidsvold iron-works near Christiania, and drew up a liberal\r\nconstitution modelled principally on the French instrument of 1791,\r\nunder which was established a national Storthing, or parliament. May\r\n17, furthermore, Prince Christian Frederick, the Danish governor of\r\nthe country, was elected king of Norway. From the Swedish point of\r\nview these sovereign acts were absolutely invalid, and upon Norway's\r\nrejection of mediation by the powers Bernadotte invaded the country at\r\nthe head of a Swedish army. In a short, sharp campaign the Norwegians\r\nwere hopelessly beaten,[809] and the upshot was that Christian\r\nFrederick was forced to abdicate (October 7, 1814), the Storthing was\r\ncompelled to give its assent to the union with Sweden (October 20),\r\nthe Eidsvold constitution was revised (November 4) to bring it into\r\naccord with the conditions of the union, and the Storthing went\r\nthrough the formality of electing Charles XIII. king of Norway and of\r\nrecognizing Bernadotte as heir to the throne. Fifty of the one hundred\r\nten articles of the Eidsvold constitution were retained unaltered; the\r\nremainder were revised or omitted. Amended upon a number of subsequent\r\noccasions, this constitution of November 4, 1814, has continued in\r\noperation to the present day as the _Grundlov_, or fundamental law, of\r\nthe Norwegian state. No constitution was ever born of a more\r\ninteresting contest for national dignity and independence.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 809: G. Björlin, Der Krieg in Norwegen,\r\n                   1814 (Stuttgart, 1895).]\r\n\r\n*634. Nature of the Union.*--The union of the two states was of a purely\r\npersonal character; that is to say, it was a union solely through the\r\ncrown. Each of the kingdoms maintained its own constitution, its own\r\nministry, its own legislature, its own laws, its own financial system,\r\nits own courts, its own army and navy. The legal basis of the\r\naffiliation was the _Riksakt_, or Act of Union, of August, 1815,--an\r\nultimate agreement between the two states which in Norway was formally\r\nadopted by the Storthing as a part of the Norwegian fundamental    (p. 575)\r\nlaw, but which in Sweden was regarded as a treaty, and hence was never\r\nincorporated by the Rigsdag within the constitution. In each of the\r\nstates the functions and status of the crown were regulated by\r\nconstitutional provisions; and the character of the royal power was by\r\nno means the same in the two. In Sweden, for example, the king\r\npossessed independent legislative power and his veto was absolute; in\r\nNorway he possessed no such independent prerogative and his veto was\r\nonly suspensive. There was a common ministry of war and another of\r\nforeign affairs; beyond this the functions of a common administration\r\nwere vested in a complicated system of joint councils of state.\r\nMatters of common concern lying outside the jurisdiction of the crown\r\nwere regulated by concurrent resolutions or laws passed by the Riksdag\r\nand the Storthing independently. But in all matters of internal\r\nlegislation and administration the two kingdoms were as separate as if\r\nno legal relations had been established between them. There was not\r\neven a common citizenship.\r\n\r\n*635. Causes of Friction.*--From the outset the union was menaced by\r\nperennial friction. Differences between the two kingdoms in respect to\r\nlanguage, manners, and economic concerns were pronounced; differences\r\nof social and political ideas were still more considerable;\r\ndifferences in governmental theories and institutions were seemingly\r\nirreconcilable. In Sweden the tone of the political system, until far\r\nin the nineteenth century, was distinctly autocratic, and that of the\r\nsocial system aristocratic; in Norway the principle that preponderated\r\nwas rather that of democracy. Between the two states there was\r\ndisagreement upon even the fundamental question of the nature of the\r\nunion. The Swedish contention was that at the Peace of Kiel Norway was\r\nceded to Sweden by Denmark and that the mere fact that, following the\r\nunsuccessful attempt of the Norwegians to establish their\r\nindependence, Sweden had chosen to grant the affiliated kingdom a\r\nseparate statehood and local autonomy did not contravene Norway's\r\nessentially subordinate position within the union. The Norwegians, on\r\nthe other hand, maintained that, in the last analysis, they comprised\r\nan independent nation and that their union with Sweden rested solely\r\nupon their own sovereign decision in 1814 to accept Charles XIII. as\r\nking; from which the inference was that Norway should be dealt with as\r\nin every respect co-ordinate with Sweden. The conflicts which sprang\r\nfrom these differences of conception were frequent and serious. There\r\nwas no disguising the fact that the administration of the joint\r\naffairs of the kingdoms was conducted from a point of view that was\r\nessentially Swedish, and the history of the union throughout the   (p. 576)\r\nperiod of its existence is largely a story of the struggle on the part\r\nof the Norwegians, through the medium of the Storthing, to attain in\r\npractice the fully co-ordinate position which they believed to be\r\nrightfully theirs. Again and again amendments to the constitution in\r\nthe interest of the royal power were submitted by successive\r\nsovereigns, only to be rejected by the Storthing.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Swedish estates insisted upon a revision of the Act of\r\nUnion which should include the establishment of a common parliament\r\nfor the two countries, in which, in approximate accordance with\r\npopulation, there would be twice as many Swedish members as Norwegian.\r\nThe Storthing, naturally enough, rejected the proposition. In 1869 the\r\nStorthing fortified its position by adopting a resolution in\r\naccordance with which its sessions, theretofore triennial, were made\r\nannual, and in 1871 the first annual Storthing rejected an elaborate\r\nmodification of the Act of Union, to which the Conservative ministry\r\nof Stang had been induced to lend its support, whereby the supremacy\r\nof Sweden would have been recognized explicitly and the bonds of the\r\nunion would have been tightened correspondingly. Two years later the\r\nnew sovereign, Oscar II. (1872-1907), gave reluctant assent to a\r\nmeasure by which the office of viceroy in Norway was abolished.\r\nThereafter the head of the government at Christiania was the president\r\nof the ministry, or premier; and, following a prolonged contest, in\r\nthe early eighties there was forced upon the crown the principle of\r\nministerial responsibility (in Norway).\r\n\r\n*636. The Question of the Consular Service.*--The rock upon which the\r\nunion foundered eventually, however, was Norway's participation in the\r\nmanagement of diplomatic and consular affairs. The subject was one\r\nwhich had been left in 1814 without adequate provision, and throughout\r\nthe century it gave rise to repeated difficulties. In 1885, and again\r\nin 1891, there was an attempt to solve the problem, but upon each\r\noccasion the only result was a deadlock, the Storthing insisting upon,\r\nand the Swedish authorities denying, Norway's right, as an independent\r\nkingdom, to participate equally with Sweden in the conduct of the\r\nforeign relations of the two states. In 1892 the Storthing resolved\r\nupon the establishment of an independent Norwegian consular service;\r\nbut to this the king would not assent. Norwegian trading and maritime\r\ninterests had come to be such that, in the opinion of the commercial\r\nand other influential classes of the kingdom, separateness of consular\r\nadministration was indispensable, and upon the success of this reform\r\nwas made to hinge eventually the perpetuity of the union itself.\r\nThroughout several years the deadlock continued. At the Norwegian\r\nelections of 1894 and 1897 the Liberals were overwhelmingly successful,\r\nand it was made increasingly apparent that the Norwegian people    (p. 577)\r\nwere veering strongly toward unrestricted national independence. July\r\n28, 1902, a lengthy report was submitted by a Swedish-Norwegian\r\nConsular Commission, constituted upon Swedish initiative earlier in\r\nthe year, in which the practicability of two entirely separate\r\nconsular systems was asserted, and, March 24, 1903, an official\r\n_communiqué_ announced the conclusion of an agreement between\r\nrepresentatives of the two countries under which there were to be\r\nworked out two essentially identical codes of law for the government\r\nof the two systems. Upon the nature of these codes, however, there\r\narose serious disagreement, and when, in 1904, the Boström ministry of\r\nSweden submitted as an absolute condition that any Norwegian consul\r\nmight be removed from office by the Swedish foreign minister, the\r\nentire project was brought to naught.\r\n\r\n*637. The Norwegian Declaration of Independence: the Separation.*--March\r\n1, 1905, the Norwegian ministry presided over by Hagerup resigned and\r\nwas replaced by a ministry made up by Christian Michelsen, which\r\nincluded representatives of both the Liberal and Conservative parties.\r\nMay 23 the Storthing, by unanimous vote, passed a new bill for the\r\nestablishment of Norwegian consulships. The king, four days later,\r\nvetoed the measure; whereupon the Michelsen government resigned. The\r\nking refused to accept the resignation; the ministers refused to\r\nreconsider it. June 7 Michelsen and his colleagues placed their\r\nresignation in the hands of the Storthing, and that body, impelled at\r\nlast to cut the Gordian knot, adopted by unanimous vote a resolution\r\nto the effect (1) that, the king having admitted his inability to form\r\na Government, the constitutional powers of the crown had become\r\ninoperative, and (2) that Oscar II. having ceased to act as king of\r\nNorway, the union with Sweden was to be regarded as _ipso facto_\r\ndissolved. By another unanimous vote the ministerial group was\r\nauthorized to exercise temporarily the prerogatives hitherto vested in\r\nthe sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn the part of certain elements in Sweden there was a disposition to\r\nresist Norwegian independence, and for a time there was prospect of\r\nwar. The mass of the people, however, cared but little for the\r\nmaintenance of the union. The prevailing national sentiment was\r\nexpressed with aptness by the king himself when he affirmed that \"a\r\nunion to which both parties do not give their free and willing consent\r\nwill be of no real advantage to either.\" June 20 the Riksdag was\r\nconvened in extraordinary session to take under advisement the\r\nsituation. Dreading war, this body eventually decided to sanction\r\nnegotiations looking toward a separation, provided, however, that the\r\nNorwegian people, either through the agency of a newly elected     (p. 578)\r\nStorthing or directly by referendum, should avow explicitly their\r\ndesire for independence. During a recess of the Riksdag a Norwegian\r\nplebiscite was taken, August 13, with the result that 368,211 votes\r\nwere cast in favor of the separation and but 184 against it. Two weeks\r\nlater eight commissioners representing the two states met at Karlstad,\r\nin Sweden, and negotiated a treaty, signed September 23, wherein the\r\nterms of the separation were specifically fixed. This instrument,\r\napproved by the Storthing October 9 and by the reassembled Riksdag\r\nOctober 16, provided for the establishment of a neutral, unfortified\r\nzone on the common frontier south of the parallel 61° and stipulated\r\nthat all differences between the two nations which should prove\r\nimpossible of adjustment by direct negotiation should be referred to\r\nthe permanent court of arbitration at the Hague, provided such\r\ndifferences should not involve the independence, integrity, or vital\r\ninterests of either nation. October 27 King Oscar formally\r\nrelinquished the Norwegian crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE NORWEGIAN CONSTITUTION--CROWN AND MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*638. The Revised Fundamental Law.*--In Norway there was widespread\r\nsentiment in favor of the establishment of a republic. The continuance\r\nof monarchy was regarded, however, as the course which might be\r\nexpected to meet with most general approval throughout Europe, and in\r\na spirit of conciliation the Storthing tendered to King Oscar an offer\r\nto elect as sovereign a member of the Swedish royal family. The offer\r\nwas rejected; whereupon the Storthing selected as a candidate Prince\r\nCharles, second son of the then Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, the\r\nlate King Frederick VIII. November 12 and 13, 1905, the Norwegian\r\npeople, by a vote of 259,563 to 69,264, ratified the Storthing's\r\nchoice, the advocates of a republic recording some 33,000 votes. The\r\nnew sovereign was crowned at Trondhjem June 22, 1906. By assuming the\r\ntitle of Haakon VII. he purposely emphasized the essential continuity\r\nof the present Norwegian monarchy with that of mediæval times.[810]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 810: Haakon VI. reigned 1343-1380,\r\n                   shortly before the Union of Kalmar.

From the Norwegian\r\n                   point of view the subject is well treated in F.\r\n                   Nansen, Norge og Foreningen med Sverige\r\n                   (Christiania, 1905), in translation, Norway and the\r\n                   Union with Sweden (London, 1905); from the Swedish,\r\n                   in K.

Woultrin, in _Annales des Sciences\r\n                   Politiques_, Jan. 15 and March 15, 1906.]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental law of Norway to-day is the Eidsvold constitution  (p. 579)\r\nof April, 1814, revised, November 4 following, to comport with the\r\nconditions of the union with Sweden. The original instrument was not\r\nonly democratic in tone, but doctrinaire. With little in the nature of\r\nnative institutions upon which to build, the framers laid hold of\r\nfeatures of the French, English, American, and other foreign systems,\r\nin the effort to transplant to Norwegian soil a body of political\r\nforms and usages calculated to produce a high order of popular\r\ngovernment. No inconsiderable portion of these forms and usages\r\nsurvived the revision enforced by the failure to achieve national\r\nindependence. Of this portion, however, several proved impracticable,\r\nand constitutional amendments after 1814 were numerous. Upon the\r\nestablishment of independence in 1905 the fundamental law was modified\r\nfurther by the elimination from it of all reference to the former\r\nSwedish affiliation. The constitution to-day comprises one hundred\r\ntwelve articles, of which forty-six deal with the executive branch of\r\nthe government, thirty-seven with citizenship and the legislative\r\npower, six with the judiciary, and twenty-three with matters of a\r\nmiscellaneous character. The process of amendment is appreciably more\r\ndifficult than that by which changes may be introduced in the Swedish\r\ninstrument.[811] Proposed amendments may be presented in the Storthing\r\nonly during the first regular session following a national election,\r\nand they may be adopted only at a regular session following the\r\nensuing election, and by a two-thirds vote. It is required,\r\nfurthermore, that such amendments \"shall never contravene the\r\nprinciples of the constitution, but shall relate only to such\r\nmodifications in particular provisions as will not change the spirit\r\nof the instrument.\"[812]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 811: See p. 589.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 812: Art. 112.

The\r\n                   most recent and, on the whole the most useful,\r\n                   treatise is B. Morgenstierne, Das Staatsrecht des\r\n                   Königreichs Norwegen (Tübingen, 1911).]\r\n\r\n*639. The Crown and the Council.*--The government of Norway, like  (p. 580)\r\nthat of Sweden and of Denmark, is in form a limited hereditary\r\nmonarchy. The popular element in it is both legally and actually more\r\nconsiderable than in the constitutional system of either of the sister\r\nScandinavian states; none the less, the principle of monarchy is\r\nfirmly entrenched, and, as has been pointed out, not even the overturn\r\nof 1905 endangered it seriously. The constitution contains provisions\r\nrespecting the succession to the throne, the conduct of affairs during\r\na minority, and the establishment of a regency, which need not be\r\nrecounted here, but which are designed to meet every possible\r\ncontingency. In the event of the absolute default of a legal successor\r\nthe Storthing is empowered to elect.\r\n\r\nSupreme executive authority is vested in the king, who must be an\r\nadherent of the Lutheran Church, and who at his accession is required\r\nto take oath in the presence of the Storthing to govern in conformity\r\nwith the constitution and laws. Associated with the king is a Council\r\nof State, upon which, since the king may be neither censured nor\r\nimpeached, devolves responsibility for virtually all executive acts.\r\nThe Council consists of a minister of state, or premier, and at least\r\nseven other members. All are appointed by the crown, and all must be\r\nNorwegian citizens not less than thirty years of age and adherents of\r\nthe established Lutheran faith. The king may apportion the business of\r\nstate among the councillors as he desires. There are at present, in\r\naddition to the ministry of state, eight ministerial portfolios, i.e.,\r\nForeign Affairs, Justice, Worship and Instruction, Agriculture,\r\nLabor, Finance, Defense, and Commerce, Navigation and Industry. All\r\nministers are regularly members of the Storthing, though by the\r\nconstitution the crown is authorized for special reasons to add to the\r\nCouncil members who possess no legislative seats. The heir to the\r\nthrone, if eighteen years of age, is entitled to a seat in the\r\nCouncil, but without vote or responsibility.\r\n\r\n*640. The Exercise of Executive Powers.*--Most of the powers which are\r\npossessed by the king may be exercised by him only in conjunction with\r\nthe Council. Like the fundamental law of Sweden, that of Norway\r\nstipulates that, while it shall be the duty of every member of the\r\nCouncil to express his opinion freely, and of the king to give ear to\r\nall such opinions, it \"shall remain with the king to decide according\r\nto his own judgment.\"[813] None the less, the acts of the crown are,\r\nas a rule, those not only, legally, of the king _in_ council but,\r\nactually, of the king _and_ council. With the exception of military\r\ncommands, all orders issued by the king must be countersigned by the\r\nminister of state, and ministers may be impeached at any time by   (p. 581)\r\nthe Odelsthing before the Rigsret, or Court of Impeachment; so that,\r\nin effect, there is a close approach to the parliamentary system of\r\nministerial responsibility. Under these conditions, the crown appoints\r\nall civil, ecclesiastical, and military officials; removes higher\r\nofficials (including the ministers) without previous judicial\r\nsentence; pardons offenders after conviction; regulates religious\r\nservices, assemblies, and meetings; issues and repeals regulations\r\nconcerning commerce, customs, industry, and public order; and enforces\r\nthe laws of the realm. The king is commander-in-chief of the land and\r\nnaval forces, though these forces may not be increased or diminished,\r\nor placed at the service of a foreign sovereign or state, without the\r\nconsent of the Storthing. And the king has the power to mobilize\r\ntroops, to commence war and conclude peace, to enter into and to\r\nwithdraw from alliances, and to send and to receive ambassadors.[814]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 813: Art. 30. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 128.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 814: Arts. 16, 17, 20-26.

Electoral System: the Franchise.*--Among the legislatures of\r\nEurope that of Norway is unique. In structure it represents a curious\r\ncross between the principles of unicameral and bicameral organization.\r\nIt comprises essentially a single body, which, however, for purely\r\nlegislative purposes is divided into two chambers, or sections, the\r\nLagthing and the Odelsthing. This division is made subsequent to the\r\nelection of the members, so that representatives are chosen simply to\r\nthe Storthing as a whole. The elections take place every third year.\r\nThere are forty-one urban, and eighty-two rural, districts, and every\r\ndistrict returns one member--a total of 123.\r\n\r\nFormerly the franchise rested, as in Sweden, upon a property\r\nqualification; but by a series of suffrage reforms within the past\r\ndecade and a half it has been brought about that in respect to\r\nelectoral privileges Norway is to-day the most democratic of European\r\ncountries. In 1898 the Liberal government of Steen procured the\r\nenactment of a measure which long had occupied a leading place in the\r\nprogramme of the radical elements. By it the parliamentary franchise\r\nwas conferred upon all male citizens of a minimum age of twenty-five\r\nyears who have resided at least five years in Norway and who have\r\nsuffered no judicial impairment of civil rights. The effect was to\r\ndouble at a stroke the national electorate. In 1901 the same Government\r\ncarried an important bill by which the suffrage in municipal elections\r\nwas conferred upon male citizens without restriction (save that of age),\r\nupon all unmarried women twenty-five years of age who pay taxes on (p. 582)\r\nan annual income of not less than 300 kronor, and upon all married\r\nwomen of similar age whose husbands are taxed in equivalent amounts.\r\nDuring ensuing years there was widespread agitation in behalf of the\r\nparliamentary franchise for women, and the Liberal party made this one\r\nof the principal items in its programme. June 14, 1907, by a vote of\r\n73 to 48, the Storthing rejected a proposal that women be given the\r\nparliamentary franchise on the same terms as men, but by the decisive\r\nmajority of 96 to 25 it conferred the privilege upon all women who\r\nwere in possession of the municipal franchise under the law of 1901.\r\nThe rapidity with which woman's suffrage sentiment had developed is\r\nindicated by the fact that as late as 1898 a proposal looking toward\r\nthe including of women in the parliamentary electorate had received in\r\nthe Storthing a total of but 33 votes. By the legislation of 1907\r\nNorway became the first of European nations to confer upon women,\r\nunder any conditions, the privilege of voting for members of the\r\nnational legislative body and of sitting as members of that body. At\r\nthe elections of 1909, the first in which women participated, no\r\nrevolutionizing effects were observed. The electorate, however, was\r\nincreased by approximately 300,000, which was somewhat over half of\r\nthe kingdom's total female population of the requisite age.[815] April\r\n30, 1910, the Constitutional Committee of the Storthing, by a majority\r\nof four to three, recommended that parliamentary suffrage be extended\r\nto women on equal terms with men, i.e., without reference to taxpaying\r\nqualifications. The recommendation was rejected, but during the next\r\nmonth the Odelsthing voted, 71 to 10, and the Lagthing, 24 to 7, to\r\napply the principle of it in municipal elections. Thus the municipal\r\nelectorate was enlarged by approximately 200,000, and the way was\r\nprepared, as many believe, for the adoption eventually of the\r\nCommittee's original recommendation. Prior to an amendment of May 25,\r\n1905, parliamentary elections were indirect. In the urban districts\r\none elector was chosen for every fifty voters, and in the rural\r\ndistricts, one for every one hundred. Now, however, elections are\r\ndirect. Each petty political unit having a municipal government of its\r\nown comprises a voting precinct. If at the first ballot no candidate\r\nin the district receives a majority of all the votes cast, a second\r\nballot is taken, when a simple plurality is decisive. A noteworthy\r\nfeature of the system is the fact that voters who on account of\r\nillness, military service, or other valid reason, are unable to appear\r\nat the polls are permitted to transmit their votes in writing to the\r\nproper election officials.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 815: At the election of 1909 the total\r\n                   number of parliamentary electors was 785,358. The\r\n                   number of votes recorded, however, was but\r\n                   487,193.]\r\n\r\n*642. Qualifications, Sessions, and Organization.*--No one may be  (p. 583)\r\nchosen a member of the Storthing unless he or she is thirty years\r\nof age, a resident of the kingdom of ten years' standing, and a\r\nqualified voter in the election district in which he or she is chosen;\r\nbut a former member of the Council of State, if otherwise qualified,\r\nmay be elected to represent any district.[816] Under recent\r\nlegislation every member of the Storthing receives a salary of three\r\nthousand kroner a year, in addition to travelling expenses. The\r\nStorthing meets in regular session annually, without regard to summons\r\nby the crown. The constitution fixed originally as the date of\r\nconvening the first week-day after October 10 of each year; but, May\r\n28, 1907, the Storthing adopted an amendment whereby, beginning with\r\n1908, the meeting time was changed to the first week-day after January\r\n10. For sufficient reasons, an extraordinary session may be convoked\r\nby the king at any time. The length of sessions is indeterminate,\r\nexcept that an extraordinary session may be adjourned by the crown at\r\nwill, and no session, extraordinary or regular, may be prolonged\r\nbeyond two months without the king's consent. At its first regular\r\nsession following a general election the Storthing divides itself into\r\ntwo chambers. A fourth of the membership is designated to constitute\r\nthe Lagthing, the remaining three-fourths comprise the Odelsthing; and\r\nthe division thus effected holds until the succeeding election. Each\r\nchamber elects its own president, secretary, and other officers.\r\nSessions are public, and business may not be transacted unless at\r\nleast two-thirds of the members are present.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 816: Arts. 59-64. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 134-135.]\r\n\r\n*643. Powers and Procedure of the Storthing.*--The powers of the\r\nStorthing, as enumerated in the constitution, include the enactment\r\nand the repeal of laws; the levying of taxes, imposts, and duties; the\r\nappropriating and the borrowing of money; the regulating of the\r\ncurrency; the examining of treaties concluded with foreign powers; the\r\ninspection of the records of the Council of State; the making of\r\nprovision for the auditing of the national accounts; and regulation of\r\nthe naturalization of foreigners.[817] All bills are required to be\r\npresented first in the Odelsthing, by one of the members of the body,\r\nor by the Government, through a councillor of state. Only in the event\r\nthat a measure passes the Odelsthing is it presented at all in the\r\nLagthing, for the sole function of the smaller chamber is to act as a\r\ncheck upon the larger one. The Lagthing may either approve or reject a\r\nbill which the Odelsthing submits, but may not amend it. A measure\r\nrejected is returned, with reasons for the rejection. Three courses\r\nare then open to the Odelsthing: to drop the measure, to submit it in\r\namended form, or to resubmit it unchanged. When a bill from the    (p. 584)\r\nOdelsthing has been twice presented to the Lagthing, and has been a\r\nsecond time rejected, the two chambers are convened in joint session,\r\nand in this consolidated body proposals are carried by a two-thirds\r\nvote. All questions pertaining to the revision of the constitution are\r\nrequired to be voted upon in this manner.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 817: Art. 75. Ibid., II., 136.]\r\n\r\n*644. The Veto Power.*--A bill passed by the Storthing is laid forthwith\r\nbefore the king. If he approves it, the measure becomes law. If he\r\ndoes not approve it, he returns it to the Odelsthing with a statement\r\nof his reasons for disapproval. A measure which has been vetoed may\r\nnot again be submitted to the king by the same Storthing. The royal\r\nveto, however, is not absolute. \"If,\" says the constitution, \"a\r\nmeasure has been passed without change by three regular Storthings\r\nconvened after three separate successive elections, and separated from\r\neach other by at least two intervening regular sessions, without any\r\nconflicting action having in the meantime been taken in any session\r\nbetween its first and last passage, and is then presented to the king\r\nwith the request that his majesty will not refuse his approval to a\r\nmeasure which the Storthing, after the most mature deliberation,\r\nconsiders beneficial, such measure shall become law even though the\r\nking fails to approve it....\"[818] In the days of the Swedish union\r\nthe precise conditions under which the royal veto might be exercised\r\nwere the subject of interminable controversy. In respect to ordinary\r\nlegislation the stipulations of the constitution were plain enough,\r\nbut in respect to measures which in essence comprised constitutional\r\namendments the silence of that instrument afforded room for wide\r\ndifferences of opinion. An especially notable conflict was that which\r\ntook place in the early eighties respecting a proposal to admit the\r\nNorwegian ministers to the Storthing with the privilege of\r\nparticipation in the deliberations of that body. The measure was\r\npassed by overwhelming majorities by three Storthings after three\r\nsuccessive general elections, and in accordance with the constitution,\r\nunder the Norwegian interpretation, it ought thereupon to have been\r\nrecognized as law. The king, however, not only refused to approve the\r\nbill, but asserted firmly that his right to exercise an absolute veto\r\nin constitutional questions was \"above all doubt\"; and when the\r\nStorthing pronounced the measure law without the royal sanction, both\r\ncrown and Swedish ministry avowed that by them it would not be\r\nrecognized as valid. In the end (in 1884) the Storthing won, but the\r\nissue was revived upon numerous occasions. Under the independent\r\nmonarchy of 1905 there has been no difficulty of the sort; nor, in\r\nview of the eminently popular aspect of kingship in Norway to-day, (p. 585)\r\nis such difficulty likely to arise.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 818: Art. 79. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 137-138.]\r\n\r\n*645. Political Parties: Liberals and Conservatives.*--Prior to the\r\naccession of Oscar II., in 1872, the preponderating fact in the\r\npolitical development of the kingdom was the gradual growth of\r\nparliamentary power on the part of the representatives of the\r\npeasantry. Between 1814 and 1830 the business of the Storthing was\r\nconducted almost wholly by members of the upper and official classes,\r\nbut during the decade 1830-1840 the peasantry rose to the position of\r\na highly influential class in the public affairs of the nation. The\r\nfirst of the so-called \"peasant Storthings\" was that of 1833. In it\r\nthe peasant representatives numbered forty-five, upwards of half of\r\nthe body. Under the leadership of Ole Ueland, who was a member of\r\nevery Storthing between 1833 and 1869, the peasant party made its\r\nparamount issue, as a rule, the reduction of taxation and the practice\r\nof economy in the national finances.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870 the intensification of the Swedish-Norwegian question led\r\nto the drawing afresh of party lines, and until the separation of\r\n1905, the new grouping continued fairly stable. By the amalgamation of\r\nthe peasant party, led by Jaabaek, and the so-called \"lawyers\" party,\r\nled by Johan Sverdrup, there came into being in the seventies a great\r\nLiberal party (the Venstre, or Left) whose fundamental purpose was to\r\nsafeguard the liberties of Norway as against Swedish aggression. Until\r\n1884 this party of nationalism was obliged to content itself with the\r\nrôle of opposition. Governmental control was lodged as yet in the\r\nConservatives, whose attitude toward Sweden was distinctly\r\nconciliatory. In 1880 the Conservative leader, Frederick Stang,\r\nresigned the premiership, but his successor was another Conservative,\r\nSelmer. At the elections of 1882 the Liberals obtained no fewer than\r\n82 of the 114 seats in the Storthing. Still the Conservatives refused\r\nto yield. In the meantime the Odelsthing had brought the entire\r\nministry to impeachment before the Rigsret for having advised the king\r\nto interpose his veto to the measure giving ministers seats in\r\nParliament. Early in 1883 Selmer and seven of his colleagues were\r\nsentenced to forfeiture of their offices, and the remaining three were\r\nfined. March 11, 1884, the king announced his purpose to abide by the\r\ndecision of the court, distasteful to him as it was, and the Selmer\r\ncabinet was requested to resign. An attempt to prolong yet further the\r\ntenure of the Conservatives failed completely, and, June 23, 1884, the\r\nking sent for Sverdrup and authorized the formation of the first\r\nLiberal ministry in Norwegian history. The principal achievement of\r\nthe new government was the final enactment of the long-contested   (p. 586)\r\nmeasure according parliamentary seats to ministers. To this project\r\nthe king at last gave his consent.\r\n\r\n*646. The Ministerial Succession to 1905.*--The Sverdrup ministry\r\nendured almost exactly four years. In 1887 the party supporting it\r\nsplit upon a question of ecclesiastical policy, and at the elections\r\nof 1888 the Conservatives obtained fifty-one seats, while of the\r\nsixty-three Liberals returned not more than twenty-six were really in\r\nsympathy with Sverdrup. July 12, 1889, Sverdrup and his colleagues\r\nresigned. Then followed a rapid succession of ministries, practically\r\nevery one of which met its fate, sooner or later, upon some question\r\npertaining to the Swedish union: (1) that of Emil Stang[819]\r\n(Conservative), July 12, 1889, to March 5, 1891; (2) that of Johannes\r\nSteen (Liberal), which lasted until April, 1893; (3) a second Stang\r\nministry, to February, 1895; and (4) the coalition ministry of\r\nProfessor Hagerup, to February, 1898. At the elections of 1897 the\r\nLiberals won a signal victory, carrying seventy-nine of the one\r\nhundred fourteen seats, and in February of the next year there was\r\nestablished a second Steen ministry, under whose direction, as has\r\nappeared, there was carried the law introducing manhood suffrage.\r\nSteen retired in April, 1902, and another Liberal government, that of\r\nBlehr, held office until October, 1903. At the elections of 1903 the\r\nConservatives and Moderates obtained sixty-three seats, the Liberals\r\nfifty, and the Socialists four. A second Hagerup ministry filled the\r\nperiod between October 23, 1903, and March 1, 1905, and upon its\r\nretirement there was constituted, under circumstances which involved\r\ntemporarily the all but complete annihilation of party lines, a\r\ncoalition ministry under Christian Michelsen, at whose hands was\r\nbrought about immediately the separation from Sweden and the\r\nconstitutional readjustments of 1905.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 819: Son of the earlier premier,\r\n                   Frederick Stang.]\r\n\r\n*647. Party History Since the Separation.*--Following the subsidence of\r\nthe excitement attending the separation the party alignments of\r\nearlier days tended rapidly to reappear. The old issues, however, had\r\nbeen disposed of, and in their place sprang up new ones, largely\r\nsocial and economic in character. At the elections of 1906 the\r\nsubjects to which the Liberals gave most prominence were female\r\nsuffrage, old age pensions, and sickness and unemployment insurance.\r\nThe Michelsen government, which was essentially Conservative, issued a\r\nmoderate reform programme and, alleging that former party lines were\r\nobsolete, called upon the citizens of all classes for support. The\r\nelections were notable chiefly by reason of the fact that the Social\r\nDemocrats increased their quota in the Storthing to eleven. Despite\r\nattacks of the more radical Left, the Michelsen cabinet stood firm (p. 587)\r\nuntil October 28, 1907, when the premier, by reason of ill health, was\r\nobliged to retire. Lövland, the minister of foreign affairs,\r\nsucceeded; but, March 14, 1908, on a vote of want of confidence, his\r\nministry was overthrown. A new cabinet was made up thereupon by the\r\nLiberal leader, Gunnar Knudsen. At the elections of 1909--the first in\r\nwhich women participated--this Liberal government lost the slender\r\nmajority which it had possessed, and January 27, 1910, it resigned.\r\nPrior to the elections there were in the Storthing fifty-nine\r\nLiberals, fifty-four Conservatives and Moderates, and ten Social\r\nDemocrats. Afterwards there were sixty-three Conservatives and\r\nModerates, forty-seven Liberals, eleven Social Democrats, and two\r\nIndependents. The popular vote of the Social Democrats was much in\r\nexcess of that at any former election, but it was so distributed that\r\nthe party realized from it but a single additional legislative seat.\r\nUpon the resignation of Knudsen the premiership was offered to\r\nMichelsen, whose health, however, precluded his accepting it. February\r\n1, 1910, a Conservative-Moderate ministry was made up by Konow.\r\nFebruary 19, 1912, it was succeeded by another ministry of the same\r\ntype, under the premiership of the former president of the Storthing,\r\nBratlie. At the elections of November 12, 1912, the Government lost\r\nheavily to the Liberals and to the Social Democrats. The socialist\r\nquota now numbers twenty-three.[820]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 820: A brief account of Norwegian\r\n                   political parties to 1900 will be found in Lavisse\r\n                   et Rambaud, Histoire Générale, XII., 266-274; to\r\n                   1906, in Cambridge Modern History, XII., 280-290.\r\n                   For additional references see pp. 578-579.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*648. The Courts.*--For the administration of civil justice the kingdom\r\nof Norway is divided into 105 districts--eighty rural and twenty-five\r\nurban--in each of which there is a court of first instance composed of\r\ntwo justices chosen by the people. There are three higher tribunals,\r\neach with a chief justice and two associates. At the top stands the\r\nHöiesteret, or Supreme Court, consisting of a chief justice and six\r\nassociates. The decisions of the Supreme Court may be neither appealed\r\nnor reviewed. For the trial of criminal cases, as regulated by law of\r\nJuly 1, 1887, there exist two types of tribunals: (1) the Lagmandsret,\r\nconsisting of a president and ten jurors and (2) the Meddomsret,\r\nconsisting of a judge and two non-professional assistants chosen for\r\neach case. There are in the kingdom four Lagdömmer, or jury districts,\r\neach divided into circuits corresponding, as a rule, to the counties.\r\nThe jury courts take cognizance of the more serious cases. \"No     (p. 588)\r\none,\" the constitution stipulates, \"shall be tried except in\r\naccordance with law or punished except by virtue of a judicial\r\nsentence; and examination by means of torture is forbidden.\"[821] The\r\nmembers of the Lagthing, together with those of the Supreme Court,\r\ncomprise the Rigsret, or Court of Impeachment. This tribunal tries,\r\nwithout appeal, cases involving charges of misconduct in office\r\nbrought by the Odelsthing against members of the Council of State, the\r\nSupreme Court, or the Storthing.[822]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 821: Art. 96. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 822: Arts. 86-87. Ibid., II., 139.]\r\n\r\n*649. Local Government.*--For purposes of administration the kingdom is\r\ndivided into twenty regions--the cities of Christiania and Bergen and\r\neighteen _Amter_, or counties. At the head of each is an Amtmand, or\r\nprefect, who is appointed by the crown. The principal local unit is\r\nthe _Herred_, or commune, of which there are upwards of seven hundred,\r\nmostly rural parishes. As a rule, the government of the commune is\r\nvested in a body of twelve to forty-eight representatives and a\r\nFormaend, or council, elected by and from the representatives and\r\ncomprising one-fourth of their number. Every third year the\r\nrepresentatives choose from among the members of the council a\r\nchairman and a deputy chairman; and, under the presidency of the\r\nAmtmand, the chairmen of the rural communes within each county meet\r\nyearly as an Amtsthing, or county diet, and adopt the budget of the\r\ncounty. Since the municipal electoral law of 1910 members of the\r\ncommunal councils are chosen on a basis of universal suffrage for both\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII                                                      (p. 589)\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF SWEDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CONSTITUTION--THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n*650. The Fundamental Laws.*--The constitution of the kingdom of Sweden\r\nis one of the most elaborate instruments of its kind in existence. It\r\ncomprises a group of fundamental laws of which the most comprehensive\r\nis the _regerings-formen_ of June 6, 1809, in 114 articles.[823]\r\nClosely related are (1) the law of royal succession of September 26,\r\n1810; (2) the law of July 16, 1812, on the liberty of the press; and\r\n(3) the law of June 26, 1866, providing for a reorganization of the\r\nlegislative chambers. The organs and powers of government are defined\r\nin much detail, but there is nothing equivalent to the bill of rights\r\nwhich finds a place in most European constitutions. The process of\r\namendment is easy and minor amendments have been frequent. Amendments\r\nmay originate with either the crown or the legislative houses, and any\r\namendment which receives the assent of the crown is declared to be\r\nadopted if, after having been proposed or approved by one Riksdag, it\r\nis sanctioned by the succeeding one. Through the re-election of the\r\nlower chamber, which must intervene between the two stages, the people\r\nhave some opportunity to participate in the amending process.[824]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 823: See p. 572.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 824: Arts. 81-82. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 240. In 1908 the ex-premier\r\n                   Staaff proposed that when the two chambers should\r\n                   disagree upon questions concerning the constitution\r\n                   and general laws resort should be had to a popular\r\n                   referendum; but the suggestion was negatived by the\r\n                   upper house unanimously and by the lower by a vote\r\n                   of 115 to 78. The text of the Swedish constitution,\r\n                   together with the supplementary fundamental laws of\r\n                   the kingdom, is contained in W. Uppström, Sveriges\r\n                   Grundlager och konstitutionela stadgar jemte\r\n                   kommunallagarne samt Norges Grundlov (6th ed.,\r\n                   Stockholm, 1903). An English version is printed in\r\n                   Dodd, Modern Constitutions, II., 219-251, and a\r\n                   French one in Dareste, Constitutions Modernes (3d\r\n                   ed.), II., 46-114. The best brief treatise upon\r\n                   Swedish constitutional history is P. Fahlbeck, La\r\n                   constitution suédoise et le parlementarisme moderne\r\n                   (Paris, 1905). The best description of the Swedish\r\n                   government as it was a quarter of a century ago is\r\n                   T. H. Aschehoug, Das Staatsrecht der vereinigten\r\n                   königreiche Schweden und Norwegen (Freiburg, 1886),\r\n                   in Marquardsen's Handbuch. The principal treatise\r\n                   in Swedish is C. Naumann, Sveriges\r\n                   statsförfatningsrätt (2d ed., Stockholm,\r\n                   1879-1884).]\r\n\r\n*651. The Crown and the Ministry.*--At the head of the state       (p. 590)\r\nstands the king. The monarchy is hereditary, and the crown is\r\ntransmitted in the male line in the order of primogeniture. It is\r\nrequired that the king shall belong invariably to the Lutheran Church\r\nand that at his accession he shall take an oath to maintain\r\nscrupulously the laws of the land. With the king is associated a\r\nStatsrad, or Council of State, appointed by the crown \"from among\r\ncapable, experienced, honest persons of good reputation, who are\r\nSwedes by birth, and who belong to the pure, evangelical faith.\"[825]\r\nBy constitutional requirement the Council is composed of eleven\r\nmembers, one of whom is designated by the king as minister of state\r\nand president of the council, or premier. Of the eleven eight are\r\nheads of the departments, respectively, of Foreign Affairs, Justice,\r\nLand Defense, Naval Defense, Home Affairs, Finance, Agriculture, and\r\nEducation and Ecclesiastical Affairs. The president and two other\r\nmembers are ministers without portfolio.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 825: Art. 4. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 220.]\r\n\r\n*652. The Exercise of Executive Powers.*--The powers of the Swedish\r\nexecutive are large. A few are exercised by the crown alone; some by\r\nthe crown in conjunction with a small specified number of ministers;\r\nthe majority by the crown and entire ministry conjointly. The king\r\nacts independently as the commander-in-chief of the land and naval\r\nforces of the kingdom. He may conclude treaties and alliances with\r\nforeign powers, after having consulted the minister of state, the\r\nminister of foreign affairs, and one other member of the Council. But\r\nif he wishes to declare war or to conclude peace he must convene in\r\nspecial session the full membership of the Council and must require of\r\neach member separately his opinion. \"The king may then,\" it is\r\nstipulated, \"make and execute such a decision as he considers for the\r\nbest interests of the country.\"[826] In other words, in such a matter\r\nthe king is obliged to consult, but not necessarily to be guided by,\r\nhis ministerial advisers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 826: Art. 13. Ibid., 223.]\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be affirmed that this is the principle which\r\nunderlies the organization of the Swedish executive. After having been\r\nprepared by one or more of the ministers, projects are considered by\r\nthe king in council; but the right of ultimate decision rests with the\r\nking. It is thus that appointments to all national offices are made,\r\ntitles of nobility are conferred, ordinances are promulgated, texts of\r\nnew laws are framed, and questions of peace and war are determined.\r\nNominally, the ministers are responsible to the Riksdag for all acts\r\nof the Government. But the constitution plainly states that after\r\nmatters have been discussed in the Council \"the king alone shall have\r\nthe power to decide.\"[827] If the king's decision is palpably      (p. 591)\r\ncontrary to the constitution or the general laws, the ministers are\r\nauthorized to enter protest. But that is all that they may do. The\r\nministers have seats in the Riksdag, where they participate in debate\r\nand, in the name of the crown, initiate legislation. But their\r\nresponsibility lies so much more directly to the king than to the\r\nlegislature that what is commonly understood as the parliamentary\r\nsystem can hardly be said to exist in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 827: Art. 9. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 221.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RIKSDAG: ELECTORAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n*653. Establishment of the Bicameral System, 1866.*--Until past the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century the Swedish Riksdag, or diet,\r\ncomprised still an assemblage of the four estates of the realm--the\r\nnobles, the clergy, the burghers, and the peasants. Throughout several\r\ndecades a preponderating political question was that of substituting\r\nfor this essentially mediæval arrangement a modern bicameral\r\nlegislative system. In 1840 the Riksdag itself insisted upon a change,\r\nbut the king, Charles XIV., refused to give his assent. During the\r\nreign of Oscar I. (1844-1859) several proposals were forthcoming, but\r\nnone met with acceptance. It was left to Charles XV. (1859-1872), in\r\ncollaboration with his able minister of justice, Baron Louis Gerhard\r\nde Geer, to effect the much-needed reform. In January, 1863, the\r\nGovernment submitted to the Estates a measure whereby there was to be\r\nconstituted a Riksdag of two chambers--an upper one, which should be\r\nessentially an aristocratic senate, and a lower, whose members should\r\nbe elected triennially by the people. In 1865 all of the four estates\r\nacted favorably upon the bill and, January 22, 1866, the measure was\r\npromulgated by the crown as an integral part of the fundamental law of\r\nthe kingdom. September 1, 1866, there were held the first national\r\nelections under the new system. Since 1866 the upper chamber has\r\nrepresented principally the old estates of the nobles and clergy, and\r\nthe lower has comprised the combined representatives of the townsmen\r\nand peasants. The one has been conservative, and even aristocratic;\r\nthe other, essentially democratic. But the reform has contributed\r\ngreatly to the breaking up of the ancient rigidity of the Swedish\r\nconstitution and has opened the way for a parliamentary leadership on\r\nthe part of the commons which was impossible so long as each of four\r\norders was in possession of an equal voice and vote in legislative\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n*654. The Upper Chamber.*--The membership of both houses of the Riksdag\r\nis wholly elective, that of the upper indirectly, and that of the  (p. 592)\r\nlower directly, by the people. The upper house consists of 150 members\r\nchosen by ballot, after the principle of proportional representation,\r\nfor a term of six years by the twenty-five Landsthings, or provincial\r\nrepresentative assemblies, and by the corporations of five of the\r\nlarger towns--Stockholm, Göteborg, Malmö, Norrköping, and Gäfle. These\r\nelectoral bodies are arranged in six groups, in one of which an\r\nelection takes place in September of every year. The franchise\r\narrangements under which they are themselves chosen are still\r\ndetermined principally with reference to property or income, but they\r\nare no longer so undemocratic as they were prior to the electoral\r\nreform of 1909, and whereas the elections were previously indirect,\r\nthey are now direct. No person may be elected to the upper chamber who\r\nis not of Swedish birth, who has not attained his thirty-fifth year,\r\nand who during three years prior to his election has not owned taxable\r\nproperty valued at 50,000 kroner or paid taxes on an annual income of\r\nat least 3,000 kroner.[828] A member who at any time loses these\r\nqualifications forthwith forfeits his seat. Members formerly received\r\nno compensation, but under the reform measure of 1909 they, as\r\nlikewise members of the lower chamber, are accorded a salary of 1,200\r\nkroner for each session of four months, and, in the event of an extra\r\nsession, 10 kroner a day, in addition to travelling expenses.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 828: These amounts were substituted in\r\n                   1909 for 80,000 and 4,000 respectively.]\r\n\r\n*655. The Lower Chamber.*--As constituted by law of 1894, modified by\r\nthe reform act of 1909, the lower chamber consists of 230 members\r\nchosen under a system of proportional representation in fifty-six\r\nelectoral districts, each of which returns from three to seven\r\ndeputies. The number of members to be chosen in each of the districts\r\nis determined triennially, immediately preceding the balloting. Prior\r\nto the franchise law of 1909 the suffrage was confined, through\r\nproperty qualifications, within very narrow bounds. The electorate\r\ncomprised native Swedes twenty-five years of age or over who were\r\nqualified as municipal voters and who possessed real property to the\r\ntaxed value of 1,000 kroner, or who paid taxes on an annual income of\r\nat least 800 kroner, or who possessed a leasehold interest for at\r\nleast five years of a taxable value of 6,000 kroner. In 1902 it was\r\ndemonstrated by statistics that of the entire male population of the\r\nkingdom over twenty-one years of age not more than thirty-four per\r\ncent could meet these qualifications.\r\n\r\n*656. Beginnings of the Movement for Electoral Reform.*--As early as\r\n1895 insistent demand began to be made in many quarters for an\r\nextension of the franchise, and in the Riksdag of 1896 Premier Boström\r\nintroduced a moderate measure looking toward that end and involving\r\nthe introduction of proportional representation. The bill,         (p. 593)\r\nhowever, was defeated. Agitation was continued, and in 1900 the\r\nLiberals made electoral reform the principal item of their programme.\r\nIn 1901 there was passed a sweeping measure for the reorganization of\r\nthe army whereby were increased both the term of military service and\r\nthe taxes by which the military establishment was supported. Argument\r\nto the effect that such an augmentation of public burdens ought to be\r\naccompanied by an extension of public privileges was not lost upon the\r\nmembers of the Conservative Government, and at the opening of the\r\nRiksdag of 1902 the Speech from the Throne assigned first place in the\r\nlegislative calendar to a Suffrage Extension bill. March 12 the\r\nmeasure was laid before the chambers. The provisions of the bill were,\r\nin brief, (1) that every male citizen, already possessed of the\r\nmunicipal franchise, who had completed his twenty-fifth year and was\r\nnot in arrears in respect to taxes or military service, should be\r\nentitled to vote for a member of the lower national chamber; and (2)\r\nthat every voter who was married, or had been married, or had\r\ncompleted his fortieth year, should be entitled to two votes. By\r\nreason of its plural voting features the measure was not well\r\nreceived, even though the plural vote was not made in any way\r\ndependent upon property. It was opposed by the Liberals and the Social\r\nDemocrats, and members even of the Conservative Government which had\r\nintroduced it withheld from it their support. Amidst unusual public\r\nperturbation the Liberals drew up a counter-proposal, which was\r\nintroduced in the lower chamber April 16. It contemplated not simply\r\none vote for all male citizens twenty-five years of age who possessed\r\nthe municipal franchise, but also a sweeping extension of the\r\nmunicipal franchise itself. The upshot was the adoption by the Riksdag\r\nof a proposal to the effect that the Government, after conducting a\r\nthorough investigation of the entire subject, should submit, in 1904,\r\na new measure based upon universal suffrage from the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\n*657. The Conservative Proposal of 1904.*--The issue was postponed, but\r\nagitation, especially on the part of the Social Democrats, was\r\nredoubled. February 9, 1904, the Government laid before the lower\r\nchamber a new suffrage bill embodying the recommendations of a\r\ncommission appointed some months previously to conduct the\r\ninvestigation which had been ordered. The principal provisions of the\r\nmeasure were (1) that every male municipal taxpayer who had attained\r\nhis twenty-fifth year, and was not deficient in respect to his fiscal\r\nor military obligations, should be entitled to one vote for a member\r\nof the Chamber; and (2) that the 230 legislative seats should be\r\ndistributed among thirty-three electoral districts, and should be\r\nfilled by deputies chosen according to the principle of            (p. 594)\r\nproportional representation. The introduction of this measure became\r\nthe signal for the appearance of a multitude of projects dealing with\r\nthe subject, most of which discarded proportional representation but\r\nimposed still fewer restrictions upon the franchise. In the upper\r\nhouse the Government's proposal, modified somewhat to meet the demands\r\nof the agrarian interests, was passed by a vote of 93 to 50; but in\r\nthe lower chamber the substance of it was rejected by the narrow\r\nmargin of 116 to 108.\r\n\r\nIn view of the continued support of the upper house and the meagerness\r\nof the opposition majority in the lower, the Government, at the\r\nopening of the Riksdag of 1905, submitted afresh its suffrage bill\r\nwithout material modification. Again there was a deluge of\r\ncounter-proposals, the most important of which was that introduced\r\nMarch 18 by Karl Staaff, in behalf of the Liberals, to the effect that\r\nevery citizen in good standing of the age of twenty-four should be\r\nentitled to one vote, and that the Chamber should consist of 165 rural\r\nand 65 urban members, chosen in single-member constituencies. May 3\r\nand 4 the Government's bill was carried in the upper house by a vote\r\nof 93 to 50, but lost in the lower by a vote of 114 to 109. Upon\r\nStaaff's project the lower house was almost equally divided.\r\n\r\n*658. The Proposal of the Staaff Government, 1906.*--Upon the\r\nresignation of the Lundeberg cabinet, October 28, 1905, following the\r\nNorwegian separation, a Liberal ministry was made up by Staaff, and\r\nwhen, January 15, 1906, the Riksdag reassembled in regular session the\r\nnew Government was ready to push to a conclusion the electoral\r\ncontroversy. February 24 Premier Staaff introduced an elaborate\r\nmeasure comprising an amplification of that which had been brought\r\nforward by him a year earlier. By stipulating that at the age of\r\ntwenty-four every man of good character should have one vote the\r\nscheme proposed enormously to enlarge the quota of enfranchised\r\ncitizens, and by apportioning representatives among the town and\r\ncountry districts in the ratio of 65 to 165 it promised to reduce\r\nmaterially the existing over-representation of the towns. It excluded\r\nfrom the franchise bankrupts, persons under guardianship, and\r\ndefaulters in respect to military service; it required for election at\r\nthe first ballot, though not at the second, an absolute majority; it\r\nstipulated that a rearrangement of constituencies, in accordance with\r\npopulation, should be made every nine years by the king. It gave no\r\nplace to the principle of proportional representation which had\r\nappeared in the proposals of the Conservative ministries of 1904 and\r\n1905; and while favorable mention was made of female suffrage, the\r\nauthors of the measure avowed the opinion that the injection of    (p. 595)\r\nthat issue at the present moment would endanger the entire reform\r\nprogramme. Amidst renewed public demonstrations the usual flood of\r\ncounter-projects, several stipulating female suffrage, made its\r\nappearance. The upper chamber, dominated by the Conservatives, held\r\nout for proportional representation, and, May 14, it negatived the\r\nStaaff proposal by a vote of 125 to 18. The day following the bill was\r\npassed in the lower chamber by a majority of 134 to 94, and a little\r\nlater proportional representation was rejected by 130 votes to 98.\r\n\r\n*659. A Compromise Bill Adopted, 1907.*--Upon the Conservative\r\nGovernment of Lindman which succeeded devolved the task of framing a\r\nmeasure upon which the two chambers could unite. A new bill made its\r\nappearance February 2, 1907. Its essential provisions were (1) that\r\nthe members of the lower chamber should be elected by manhood suffrage\r\n(with the limitations specified in the Liberal programme of 1906) and\r\nproportional representation; (2) that the number of electoral\r\ndistricts should be fixed at fifty-six, each to return from three to\r\nseven members; (3) that members of the upper chamber should be elected\r\nby the provincial Landsthings and the municipal councils for six years\r\ninstead of nine as hitherto, and by proportional representation; and\r\n(4) that the municipal suffrage, which forms the basis of the\r\nelections to the Landsthing, should be democratized in such a manner\r\nthat, whereas previously a wealthy elector might cast a maximum of 100\r\nvotes in the towns and 5,000 in the rural districts,[829] henceforth\r\nthe maximum of votes which might be cast by any one elector should be\r\nforty. By the Liberals and Social Democrats this measure was denounced\r\nas inadequate, although on all sides it was admitted that the changes\r\nintroduced by it were so sweeping as to amount to a positive revision\r\nof the constitution. The spokesmen of the Liberal Union reintroduced\r\nthe Staaff bill of 1906, and the Social Democrats brought forward a\r\nnew measure which accorded a prominent place to female suffrage.\r\nFebruary 8 the two chambers elected a joint committee to investigate\r\nand report upon the Government's project. Various amendments were\r\nadded to the bill, e.g., one whereby members of the upper chamber\r\nhenceforth should receive an emolument for their services, and\r\neventually, May 14, the measure was brought to a vote. Despite the\r\napprehensions of the Government, it was carried. In the lower house\r\nthe vote was 128 to 98; in the upper, 110 to 29.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 829: Under the prevailing system, each\r\n                   elector in the towns had one vote for every 100\r\n                   kroner income, subject to a limit of 100 votes;\r\n                   each one in the country had ten votes for every 100\r\n                   kroner income, subject to a limit of 5,000 votes.]\r\n\r\n*660. Final Enactment, 1909: Woman's Suffrage.*--The measure       (p. 596)\r\ncomprised a series of constitutional amendments, and, in accordance\r\nwith the requirements in such cases, it remained in abeyance until a\r\nnewly elected Riksdag (chosen in 1908 and assembled in 1909) should\r\nhave had an opportunity to take action upon it. In the Riksdag of 1908\r\nex-Premier Staaff introduced a measure granting female suffrage in\r\nparliamentary elections and extending it in municipal elections. But\r\nboth chambers negatived this and every other proposal offered upon the\r\nsubject, preferring to support the Government in its purpose to keep\r\nthe issue of woman's suffrage in the background until the reforms of\r\n1907 should have been carried to completion. Early in the session of\r\n1909 the \"preliminary resolution\" of 1907 was given the final approval\r\nof the chambers. The Liberals, being now interested principally in the\r\nwoman's suffrage propaganda, did not combat the measure, so that the\r\nmajorities for its adoption were overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of this piece of legislation constitutes a landmark in\r\nSwedish political history. Through upwards of a decade the question of\r\nfranchise reform had overshadowed all other public issues and had\r\ndistracted attention from various pressing problems of state.\r\nDenounced still by the extremists of both radical and conservative\r\ngroups, the new law was hailed by the mass of the nation with the most\r\nevident satisfaction.[830] The question of woman's suffrage remains.\r\nAt the elections of 1908 the Liberal party emulated the Social\r\nDemocrats in the incorporation of this project in its programme, and,\r\nApril 21, 1909, the Constitutional Committee of the Riksdag\r\nrecommended the adoption of a measure whereby women should be accorded\r\nthe parliamentary suffrage and eligibility to sit as members of either\r\nchamber. In May, 1911, the essentials of this recommendation were\r\naccepted by the lower chamber by a vote of 120 to 92, but by the upper\r\nthey were rejected overwhelmingly. At the opening of the Riksdag of\r\n1912 the Speech from the Throne announced the purpose of the\r\nGovernment to introduce a measure for the enfranchisement of women,\r\nand during the session the promise was redeemed by the bringing    (p. 597)\r\nforward of a bill in accordance with whose terms every Swede, without\r\ndistinction of sex, over twenty-four years of age and free from legal\r\ndisabilities, may vote for members of the lower chamber.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 830: In the main, the scheme of\r\n                   proportional representation adopted in Sweden is\r\n                   similar to that in operation in Belgium (see pp.\r\n                   542-545). Electors are expected to write at the\r\n                   head of their ballot papers the name or motto of\r\n                   their party. The papers bearing the same name or\r\n                   emblem are then grouped together, the numbers in\r\n                   each group are ascertained, and the seats available\r\n                   are allotted to these groups in accordance with the\r\n                   d'Hondt rule, irrespective of the number of votes\r\n                   obtained by individual candidates. The candidate\r\n                   receiving the largest number of votes is declared\r\n                   elected. The papers on which his name appears are\r\n                   then marked down to the value of one-half, the\r\n                   relative position of the remaining candidates is\r\n                   ascertained afresh, and the highest of these is\r\n                   declared elected, and so on. Unlike the Belgian\r\n                   system, the Swedish plan provides for the allotment\r\n                   of but a single seat at a time.

Organization and Procedure.*--By the Riksdag law of 1866 the king\r\nis required to summon the chambers annually and empowered to convene\r\nextraordinary sessions as occasion may demand. It is within the\r\ncompetence of the king in council to dissolve either or both of the\r\nchambers, but in such an event a general election must be ordered\r\nforthwith, and the new Riksdag is required to be assembled within\r\nthree months after the dissolution.[831] The president and\r\nvice-presidents of both houses are named by the crown; otherwise the\r\nchambers are permitted to choose their officials and to manage their\r\naffairs independently. It is specifically forbidden that either house,\r\nor any committee, shall deliberate upon or decide any question in the\r\npresence of the sovereign. The powers of the Riksdag cover the full\r\nrange of civil and criminal legislation; but no measure may become law\r\nwithout the assent of the crown. In other words, the veto which the\r\nking possesses is absolute. At the same time, the king is forbidden,\r\nsave with the consent of the Riksdag, to impose any tax, to contract\r\nany loan, to dispose of crown property, to alienate any portion of the\r\nkingdom, to change the arms or flag of the realm, to modify the\r\nstandard or weight of the coinage, or to introduce any alteration in\r\nthe national constitution. Measures may be proposed, not only by the\r\nGovernment, but by members of either house. The relations between the\r\ntwo houses are peculiarly close. At each regular session there are\r\nconstituted certain joint committees whose function is the preparation\r\nand preliminary consideration of business for the attention of both\r\nchambers. Most important among these committees is that on laws,\r\nwhich, in the language of the constitution, \"elaborates projects\r\nsubmitted to it by the houses for the improvement of the civil,\r\ncriminal, municipal, and ecclesiastical laws.\"[832] Other such\r\ncommittees are those on the constitution, on finance, on\r\nappropriations, and on the national bank.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 831: Art. 109. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 249.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 832: Art. 53. Ibid., II., 234.]\r\n\r\n*662. Powers.*--The stipulations of the constitution which relate to\r\nfinance are precise. \"The ancient right of the Swedish people to tax\r\nthemselves,\" it is affirmed, \"shall be exercised by the Riksdag\r\nalone.\"[833] The king is required at each regular session to lay   (p. 598)\r\nbefore the Riksdag a statement of the financial condition of the\r\ncountry in all of its aspects, both income and expenses, assets and\r\ndebts. It is made the duty of the Riksdag to vote such supplies as the\r\ntreasury manifestly needs and to prescribe specifically the objects\r\nfor which the separate items of appropriation may be employed; also to\r\nvote two separate amounts of adequate size to be used by the king in\r\nemergency only, in the one instance in the event of war, in the other,\r\nwhen \"absolutely necessary for the defense of the country, or for\r\nother important and urgent purposes.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 833: Art. 57. Ibid., 234.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Riksdag is authorized and required to exercise a\r\nsupervisory vigilance in relation to the several branches of the\r\ngovernmental system. One of the functions of the Constitutional\r\nCommittee is that of inspecting the records of the Council of State to\r\ndetermine whether there has been any violation of the constitution or\r\nof the general laws; and in the event of positive findings the\r\nCommittee may institute proceedings before the Riksrâtt, or Court of\r\nImpeachment. At every regular session the Riksdag is required to\r\nappoint a solicitor-general, ranking equally with the attorney-general\r\nof the crown, with authority to attend the sessions of any of the\r\ncourts of the kingdom, to examine all judicial records, to present to\r\nthe Riksdag a full report upon the administration of justice\r\nthroughout the nation, and, if necessary, to bring charges of\r\nimpeachment against judicial officers. Every third year the Riksdag\r\nappoints a special commission to determine whether all of the members\r\nof the Supreme Court \"deserve to be retained in their important\r\noffices.\" Every third year, too, a commission of six is constituted\r\nwhich, under the presidency of the solicitor-general, overhauls the\r\narrangements respecting the liberty of the press.[834]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 834: Arts. 96-100. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 244-245.]\r\n\r\n*663. Political Parties: Military and Tariff Questions.*--In Sweden, as\r\nin European countries generally, the party alignment which lies at the\r\nroot of contemporary politics is that of Conservatives and Liberals.\r\nMuch of the time, however, within the past half-century party\r\ndemarcations have been vague and shifting, being determined largely in\r\nsuccessive periods by the rise and disappearance of various\r\npreponderating public issues. The first great question upon which\r\nparty affiliations were shaped after the accession of Oscar II. in\r\n1872 was that of national defense. The army and navy were recognized\r\nat that time to be hopelessly antiquated, and the successive\r\nConservative ministries of the seventies were resolved upon greatly\r\nincreased expenditures in the interest of military and naval\r\nrehabilitation. Against this programme was set squarely that of rigid\r\neconomy, urged by the strongly organized Landtmannapartiet, or     (p. 599)\r\nAgricultural party, representing the interests of the landed\r\nproprietors, large and small, of the kingdom. The Landtmannapartiet\r\nwas founded in 1867, immediately following the reconstitution of the\r\nRiksdag under the law of 1866, and through several decades it\r\ncomprised the dominating element in the lower chamber, in addition to\r\npossessing at times no inconsiderable amount of influence in the upper\r\none. Throughout the period covered by the Conservative ministry of\r\nBaron de Geer (1875-1880) and the Agricultural party's government\r\nunder Arvid Posse (1880-1883) there was an all but unbroken deadlock\r\nbetween the upper chamber, dominated by the partisans of military\r\nexpenditure, and the lower, dominated equally by the advocates of\r\ntax-reduction. It was not until 1885 that a ministry under Themptander\r\nsucceeded in procuring the enactment of a compromise measure\r\nincreasing the obligation of military service but remitting thirty per\r\ncent of the land taxes. By this legislation the military and tax\r\nissues were put in the way of eventual adjustment.\r\n\r\nAlready there had arisen a new issue, upon which party lines were\r\nchiefly to be drawn during the later eighties and earlier nineties.\r\nThis was the question of the tariff. The continued distress of the\r\nagrarian interests after 1880, arising in part from the competition of\r\nforeign foodstuffs, suggested to the landed interests of Sweden that\r\nthe nation would do well to follow in the path already entered upon by\r\nGermany. The consequence was the rise of a powerful protectionist\r\nparty, opposed by a free trade party with which were identified\r\nespecially the merchant classes. In 1886 the agrarians procured a\r\nmajority in the lower chamber, and by 1888 they were in control of\r\nboth branches. The free trade Themptander ministry was thereupon\r\nreplaced by the protectionist ministry of Bildt, under which, in 1888,\r\nthere were introduced protective duties on cereals, and later, in\r\n1891-1892, on manufactured commodities. Step by step, the customs\r\npolicy developed by Sweden during the middle of the century was\r\nreversed completely.\r\n\r\n*664. Politics Since 1891.*--July 10, 1891, the Conservative Erik Gustaf\r\nBoström, became premier, and thereafter, save for a brief interval\r\ncovered by the von Otter ministry (September, 1900, to July, 1902)\r\nthis able representative of the dominant agrarian interests continued\r\nuninterruptedly at the helm until the Norwegian crisis in the spring\r\nof 1905. With the elimination, however, of the tariff issue from the\r\nfield of active politics, Premier Boström adopted an attitude on\r\npublic questions which, on the whole, was essentially independent. In\r\nthe later nineties there arose two problems, neither entirely new,\r\nwhich were destined long to occupy the attention of the Government\r\nalmost to the exclusion of all things else. One of these was the   (p. 600)\r\nreadjustment with Norway. The other was the question of electoral\r\nreform. The one affected considerably the fate of ministries, but did\r\nnot alter appreciably the alignment of parties; the other became the\r\nissue upon which party activity largely turned through a number of\r\nyears. All parties from the outset professed to favor electoral\r\nreform, but upon the nature and extent of such reform there was the\r\nwidest difference of sentiment and policy. During the course of the\r\ncontest upon this issue the Liberal party tended to become distinctly\r\nmore radical than it had been in the nineties; and it is worthy of\r\nnote that the rise of the Social Democrats to parliamentary importance\r\nfalls almost entirely within the period covered by the electoral\r\ncontroversy. The first Social Democratic member of the Riksdag was\r\nelected in 1896. From 1906 to 1911 the Conservative ministry of\r\nLindman, supported largely by the landholding elements of both\r\nchambers, maintained steadily its position. At the elections of 1908\r\nthe Liberals realized some gains, and at those of 1911 both they and\r\nthe Social Democrats cut deeply into the Conservative majority. When,\r\nin September, 1911, it appeared that the Liberals had procured 102\r\nseats in the lower chamber, the Social Democrats 64, and the\r\nConservatives but 64, the Lindman government promptly resigned and a\r\nnew ministry was made up by the Liberal leader and ex-premier Staaff.\r\nThe invitation which was extended the Social Democrats to participate\r\nin the forming of the ministry was declined. In October the upper\r\nchamber was dissolved, for the first time in Swedish history, and at\r\nthe elections which were concluded November 30 the Liberals and Social\r\nDemocrats realized another distinct advance. Before the elections the\r\nchamber contained 116 Conservatives, 30 Liberals, and 4 Social\r\nDemocrats; following them the quotas were, respectively, 87, 51, and\r\n12.[835]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 835: V. Pinot, Le parlementarisme\r\n                   suédois, in _Revue Politique et Parlementaire_,\r\n                   Sept. 10, 1912.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n*665. The Courts.*--In theory the judicial power in Sweden, being lodged\r\nultimately in the crown, is indistinguishable from the executive; in\r\npractice, however, it is essentially independent. The constitution\r\nregulates with some minuteness the character of the principal\r\ntribunal, the _Högsta Domstolen_, or Supreme Court, but leaves the\r\norganization of the inferior courts to be determined by the king and\r\nthe Riksdag. The Supreme Court consists of eighteen \"councillors of\r\njustice\" appointed by the crown from among men of experience, honesty,\r\nand known legal learning. The functions of the court are largely   (p. 601)\r\nappellate, but it is worthy of note that in the event that a request\r\nis made of the king by the lower courts, or by officials, respecting\r\nthe proper interpretation of a law, the Supreme Court is authorized to\r\nfurnish such interpretation, provided the subject is a proper one for\r\nthe consideration of the courts. Cases of lesser importance may be\r\nheard and decided in the Supreme Court by five, or even four, members,\r\nwhen all are in agreement. In more important cases at least seven\r\njudges must participate. When the king desires he may be present, and\r\nwhen present he possesses two votes in all cases heard and decided.\r\nWhen the question is one of legal interpretation he is entitled to two\r\nvotes, whether or not he actually attends the proceedings. All\r\ndecisions are rendered in the name of the king. The inferior tribunals\r\ncomprise 212 district courts, or courts of first instance, and three\r\nhigher courts of appeal (_hofrâtter_), situated at Stockholm,\r\nJönköping, and Kristianstad. In the 91 urban districts the court\r\nconsists of the burgomaster and at least two aldermen; in the 121\r\nrural districts, of a judge and twelve elected and unpaid peasant\r\nproprietors serving as jurymen. No person occupying judicial office\r\nmay be removed save after trial and judgment.\r\n\r\n*666. Local Government.*--The kingdom is divided into twenty-five\r\nadministrative provinces or counties (_lân_).[836] The principal\r\nexecutive official in each is a _landshöfding_, or prefect, who is\r\nappointed by the crown and assisted by a varying number of bailiffs\r\nand sub-officials. Each province has a Landsthing, or assembly, which\r\nmeets for a few days annually, in September, under the presidency of a\r\nmember designated by the crown. All members are elected directly by\r\nthe voters of the towns and rural districts, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportional representation, and under a body of\r\nfranchise regulations which, while much liberalized in 1909, still is\r\nbased essentially upon property-holding. The function of the\r\nLandsthing is the enactment of provincial legislation and the general\r\nsupervision of provincial affairs. In a few of the larger\r\ntowns--Stockholm, Göteborg, Malmö, Norrköping, and Gäfle--these\r\nfunctions are vested in a separate municipal council. The conditions\r\nunder which purely local affairs are administered are regulated by the\r\ncommunal laws of March 21, 1862. Each rural parish and each town\r\ncomprises a self-governing commune. Each has an assembly, composed of\r\nall taxpayers, which passes ordinances, elects minor officials, and\r\ndecides petty questions of purely communal concern.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 836: One of these comprises simply the\r\n                   city of Stockholm.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IX.--THE IBERIAN STATES                                       (p. 603)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE BEGINNINGS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM\r\n\r\n*667. The Napoleonic Régime and the National Resistance.*--It was the\r\nfortune of the kingdom of Spain, as it was that of the several Italian\r\nstates, to be made tributary to the dominion of Napoleon; and in\r\nSpain, as in Italy, the first phase of the growth of constitutional\r\ngovernment fell within the period covered by the Corsican's\r\nascendancy. Starting with the purpose of punishing Portugal for her\r\nrefusal to break with Great Britain, Napoleon, during the years\r\n1807-1808, worked out gradually an Iberian policy which comprehended\r\nnot only the subversion of the independent Portuguese monarchy but\r\nalso the reduction of Spain to the status of a subject kingdom. In\r\npursuance of this programme French troops began, in February, 1808,\r\nthe occupation of Spanish strongholds, including the capital. The aged\r\nBourbon king, Charles IV., was induced to renounce his throne and the\r\ncrown prince Ferdinand his claim to the succession, and, June 6,\r\nJoseph Bonaparte, since 1806 king of Naples, was designated sovereign.\r\nAn assembly of ninety-one pliant Spanish notables, convened at Bayonne\r\nin the guise of a junta, was influenced both to \"petition\" the Emperor\r\nfor Joseph's appointment and to ratify the _projet_ of a Napoleonic\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's seizure of the crown of Spain was an act of sheer violence,\r\nand from the outset Joseph was considered by his subjects a simple\r\nusurper. The establishment of the new régime at Madrid became the\r\nsignal for a national uprising which not only compelled the Emperor\r\nseriously to modify his immediate plans and to lead in person a\r\ncampaign of conquest, but contributed in the end to the collapse of\r\nthe entire Napoleonic fabric. Upon the restoration of some degree of\r\norder there followed the introduction of a number of reforms--the\r\nsweeping away of the last vestiges of feudalism, the abolition of the\r\ntribunal of the Inquisition, the reduction of the number of monasteries\r\nand convents by a third, and the repeal of all internal customs.   (p. 604)\r\nBut the position occupied by the alien sovereign was never other than\r\nprecarious. At no time did he secure control over the whole of the\r\ncountry, and during the successive stages of the Peninsular War of\r\n1807-1814 his mastery of the situation diminished gradually to the\r\nvanishing point. At the outset the principal directing agencies of the\r\nopposition were the irregularly organized local juntas which sprang up\r\nin the various provinces, but before the end of 1808 there was\r\nconstituted a central junta of thirty-four members, and in September,\r\n1810, there was convened at Cadiz a general Cortes--not three estates,\r\nas tradition demanded, but a single assembly of indirectly elected\r\ndeputies of the people.\r\n\r\n*668. The Constitution of 1812.*--Professing allegiance to the captive\r\nFerdinand, the Cortes of 1810 addressed itself first of all to the\r\nprosecution of the war and the maintenance of the national\r\nindependence, but after a year it proceeded to draw up a constitution\r\nfor a liberalized Bourbon monarchy. Save the fundamental decree upon\r\nwhich rested nominally the government, of Joseph Bonaparte, this\r\nconstitution, promulgated March 19, 1812, was the first such\r\ninstrument in Spanish history. It was, of course, the first to emanate\r\nfrom Spanish sources. Permeating it throughout were the radical\r\nprinciples of the French constitution of 1791. It asserted\r\nunreservedly the sovereignty of the people and proclaimed as\r\ninviolable the principle of equality before the law. Executive\r\nauthority it intrusted to the king, but the monarch was left so scant\r\na measure of independence that not only might he never prorogue or\r\ndissolve the Cortes, but not even might he marry or set foot outside\r\nthe kingdom without express permission. For the actual exercise of the\r\nexecutive functions there were created seven departments, or\r\nministries, each presided over by a responsible official. The\r\nfundamental powers of state were conferred upon a Cortes of one\r\nchamber, whose members were to be elected for a term of two years by\r\nindirect manhood suffrage. Various features of the French constitution\r\nwhich experience had shown to be ill-advised were reproduced blindly\r\nenough, among them the ineligibility of members of the legislative\r\nbody for re-election and the disqualification of ministers to sit as\r\nmembers. The government of the towns was intrusted to the inhabitants;\r\nthat of the provinces, to a governor appointed by the central\r\nauthorities and an assembly of deputies popularly chosen for a term of\r\nfour years. As the starting point of Spanish constitutional\r\ndevelopment the fundamental law of 1812 is of genuine interest. It is\r\nnot to be imagined, however, that the instrument reflects with any\r\ndegree of accuracy the political sentiment and ideals of the mass of\r\nthe Spanish people. On the contrary, it was the work of a slender  (p. 605)\r\ndemocratic minority, and it was never even submitted to the nation for\r\nratification. It was a product of revolution, and at no time was there\r\nopportunity for its framers to put it completely into operation.[837]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 837: For brief accounts of the Napoleonic\r\n                   régime in Spain see Cambridge Modern History, IX.,\r\n                   Chap. 11 (bibliography, pp. 851-853); Lavisse et\r\n                   Rambaud, Histoire Générale, IX., Chap. 6; A.\r\n                   Fournier, Life of Napoleon the First, 2 vols., (new\r\n                   ed.

The Restoration and the Reign of Ferdinand VII.*--Upon the fall of\r\nNapoleon the legitimate sovereign, under the name of Ferdinand VII.,\r\nwas established forthwith upon the Spanish throne. At one time he had\r\nprofessed a purpose to perpetuate the new constitution, but even\r\nbefore his return to Madrid he pronounced both the constitution and\r\nthe various decrees of the Cortes \"null and of no effect,\" and when\r\nthe Cortes undertook to press its claims to recognition it found\r\nitself powerless. In the restoration of absolutism the king was\r\nsupported not only by the army, the nobility, and the Church, but also\r\nby the mass of the people. For constitutional government there was\r\nplainly little demand, and if Ferdinand had been possessed of even the\r\nmost ordinary qualities of character and statesmanship, he might\r\nprobably have ruled successfully in a perfectly despotic manner\r\nthroughout the remainder of his life. As it was, the reaction was\r\naccompanied by such glaring excesses that the spirit of revolution was\r\nkept alive, and scarcely a twelvemonth passed in the course of which\r\nthere were not menacing uprisings. In January, 1820, a revolt of\r\nunusual seriousness began in a mutiny at Cadiz on the part of the\r\nsoldiers who were being gathered for service in America. The revolt\r\nspread and, to save himself, the king revived the constitution of 1812\r\nand pledged himself to a scrupulous observance of its stipulations.\r\nThe movement, however, was doomed to prompt and seemingly complete\r\nfailure. The liberals were disunited, and the two years during which\r\nthe king was virtually a prisoner in their hands comprised a period of\r\nsheer anarchy. The powers of the Holy Alliance, moreover, in congress\r\nat Verona (1822), adopted a programme of intervention, in execution of\r\nwhich, in April, 1823, the French government sent an army across the\r\nPyrenees under the command of the Duke of Angoulême. A six months'\r\ncampaign, culminating in the capture of Cadiz, whither the Cortes had\r\ncarried the king, served effectively to crush the revolution and to\r\nreinstate the sovereign completely in the position which he had    (p. 606)\r\noccupied prior to 1820. Then followed a fresh period of repression, in\r\nthe course of which the constitution of 1812 was again set aside, and\r\nthroughout the remaining decade of the reign the government of the\r\nkingdom was both despotic and utterly unprogressive.[838]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 838: On the period covered by Ferdinand's\r\n                   reign see Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap. 7\r\n                   (bibliography, pp. 808-811); Lavisse et Rambaud,\r\n                   Histoire Générale, X., Chap. 6; Clarke, Modern\r\n                   Spain, Chaps. 2-4, and Hume, Modern Spain,\r\n                   1788-1898, Chaps. 5-6.

POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, 1833-1876\r\n\r\n*670. Maria Christina and the Estatuto Real of 1834.*--Ferdinand VII.\r\ndied September 29, 1833, leaving no son. Regularly since the\r\nestablishment of the Bourbon dynasty the succession in Spain had been\r\ngoverned by the principle of the Salic Law, imported originally from\r\nFrance. But, to the end that the inheritance might fall to a daughter\r\nrather than to his brother, Don Carlos, Ferdinand had promulgated, in\r\n1830, a Pragmatic Sanction whereby the Salic principle was set aside.\r\nDon Carlos and his supporters refused absolutely to admit the validity\r\nof this act, but Ferdinand was succeeded by his three-year-old\r\ndaughter, Isabella, and the government was placed in the hands of the\r\nqueen-mother, Maria Christina of Naples, as regent.[839] Her\r\nadministration of affairs lasted until 1840. From the constitutional\r\npoint of view the period was important solely because, under stress of\r\ncircumstances, the regent was driven to adopt a distinctly liberal\r\npolicy, and, in time, to promulgate a new constitutional instrument.\r\nDon Carlos, supported by the nobility, the clergy, and other\r\nreactionary elements, kept up a guerilla war by which the tenure of\r\nthe \"Christinos\" was endangered continuously. The regent was herself a\r\nthoroughgoing absolutist, but her sole hope lay in the support of  (p. 607)\r\nthe liberals, and to retain that it was necessary for her to make\r\nlarge concessions. The upshot was that in April, 1834, she issued a\r\nroyal statute (_Estatuto Real_), whereby there was established a new\r\ntype of Cortes, comprising two chambers instead of one. The upper\r\nhouse, or Estamento de Proceres, was essentially a senate; the lower,\r\nor Estamento de Procuradores, was a chamber of deputies. Members of\r\nthe Procuradores were to be elected by taxpayers for a term of three\r\nyears. Upon the Cortes was conferred power of taxation and of\r\nlegislation; but the Government alone might propose laws, and the\r\nCortes, like its ancient predecessor, was allowed no initiative save\r\nthat of petitioning the Government to submit measures upon particular\r\nsubjects. A minimum of one legislative session annually was\r\nstipulated; but the sovereign was left free otherwise to convoke and\r\nto dissolve the chambers at will. Ministers were recognized to be\r\nresponsible solely to the crown.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 839: In the mediæval states of Spain\r\n                   there was no discrimination against female\r\n                   succession. The Spanish Salic Law was enacted by a\r\n                   decree of Philip V. in 1713, at the close of the\r\n                   War of the Spanish Succession. Its original object\r\n                   was to prevent the union of the crowns of France\r\n                   and Spain. In view of the change which had come in\r\n                   the international situation, Charles IV., supported\r\n                   by the Cortes, in 1789 abrogated the act of 1713\r\n                   and re-established the law of _Siete Partidas_\r\n                   which permitted the succession of women. This\r\n                   measure was recorded in the archives, but was not\r\n                   published at the time; so that what Ferdinand VII.\r\n                   did was simply to publish, May 19, 1830, at the\r\n                   instigation of the Queen, this _pragmatica_, or\r\n                   law, of 1789. The birth of Isabella occurred the\r\n                   following October 10.]\r\n\r\n*671. The Constitution of 1837.*--Toward the establishment of\r\nconstitutional government the Statute of 1834 marked some, albeit\r\nsmall, advance. The Moderados, or moderate liberals, were disposed to\r\naccept it as the largest concession that, for the present, could be\r\nexpected. But the Progressistas, or progressives, insisted upon a\r\nrevival of the more democratic constitution of 1812, and in 1836 the\r\nregent was compelled by a widespread military revolt to sign a decree\r\npledging the Government to this policy. A constituent Cortes was\r\nconvoked and the outcome was the promulgation of the constitution of\r\nJune 17, 1837, based upon the instrument of 1812, but in respect to\r\nliberalism standing midway between that instrument and the Statute of\r\n1834. Like the constitution of 1812, that of 1837 affirmed the\r\nsovereignty of the nation and the responsibility of ministers to the\r\nlegislative body. On the other hand, the Cortes was to consist, as\r\nunder the Statute, of two houses, a Senate and a Congress. The members\r\nof the one were to be appointed for life by the crown; those of the\r\nother were to be elected by the people for three years. In a number of\r\nrespects the instrument of 1837 resembled the recently adopted\r\nconstitution of Belgium, even as the Statute of 1834 had resembled the\r\nFrench Charter of 1814. In the words of a Spanish historian, the\r\ndocument of 1837 had the two-fold importance of \"assuring the\r\nconstitutional principle, which thenceforth was never denied, and of\r\nending the sentiment of idolatry for the constitution of 1812.\"[840]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 840: R. Altamira, in Cambridge Modern\r\n                   History, X., 238.]\r\n\r\n*672. The Constitution of 1845.*--October 12, 1840, the regent Maria\r\nChristina was forced by the intensity of civil discord to abdicate and\r\nto withdraw to France. Her successor was General Espartero, leader of\r\nthe Progressistas and the first of a long line of military men to\r\nwhom it has fallen at various times to direct the governmental     (p. 608)\r\naffairs of the Spanish nation. November 8, 1843, the princess Isabella\r\nalthough yet but thirteen years old, was declared of age and, under\r\nthe name of Isabella II., was proclaimed sovereign. Her reign,\r\ncovering the ensuing twenty years, comprised distinctly an era of\r\nstagnation and veiled absolutism. Nominally the constitution of 1837\r\ncontinued in operation until 1845. At that time it was replaced by a\r\nrevised and less liberal instrument, drawn up by the Moderados with\r\nthe assistance of an ordinary Cortes. The duration of the Cortes was\r\nextended from three to four years, severer restrictions upon the press\r\nwere established, supervision of the local authorities was still\r\nfurther centralized, and the requirement that the sovereign might not\r\nmarry without the consent of the Cortez was rescinded. In the course\r\nof a revolutionary movement in 1854 there was convoked a constituent\r\nCortes, dominated by Moderates and Progressives. The constitution\r\nwhich this body framed, comprising essentially a revival of the\r\ninstrument of 1837, was never, however, put in operation. In the end,\r\nby a royal decree of 1856, the constitution of 1845 was amended and\r\nre-established. Save for some illiberal amendments of 1857,[841] which\r\nwere repealed in 1864, this instrument of 1845 continued in operation\r\nuntil 1868. Throughout the period, however, constitutionalism was\r\nhardly more than a fiction.[842]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 841: One established conditions under\r\n                   which senatorial seats might be made hereditary.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 842: Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap.\r\n                   7; XI., Chap. 20; Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire\r\n                   Générale, X., Chap. 6; XI., Chap. 9; Hume, Modern\r\n                   Spain, Chaps. 7-12; Clarke, Modern Spain, Chaps.\r\n                   5-11; Mariano, La Regencia de D.

The Constitution of 1869: King Amadeo.*--By a revolt which began\r\nin September, 1868, the queen was compelled to flee from the country,\r\nand, eventually, June 25, 1869, to abdicate. A provisional government\r\neffected arrangements for the election of a Cortes by manhood\r\nsuffrage, and this Cortes, convened at the capital, February 11, 1869,\r\naddressed itself first of all to the task of drafting a new national\r\nconstitution. A considerable number of members advocated the\r\nestablishment of a republic; but for so radical an innovation there\r\nwas clearly no general demand, and in the end the proposition was\r\nrejected by a vote of 214 to 71. June 1 a constitution was adopted\r\nwhich, however, marked a large advance in the direction of liberalism.\r\nIt contained substantial guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of\r\nthe press, liberty of religion, and the right of petition and of\r\npublic assembly, and in unequivocal terms the sovereignty of the\r\npeople was affirmed afresh. A Cortes of two houses was provided    (p. 609)\r\nfor, the members of the Senate to be chosen indirectly by the people\r\nthrough electoral colleges and the provincial assemblies, those of the\r\nCongress to be elected by manhood suffrage, the only qualification for\r\nvoting being the attainment of the age of twenty-five years and\r\npossession of ordinary civil rights.\r\n\r\nPending the selection of a sovereign, a regency was established under\r\nMarshal Serrano. Among the several dignitaries who were\r\nconsidered--Alfonso (son of the deposed Isabella) the Duke of\r\nMontpensier, Ferdinand of Savoy (brother of King Victor Emmanuel of\r\nItaly), King Luiz of Portugal, Ferdinand of Saxony, Leopold of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and Prince Amadeo, duke of Aosta, second son\r\nof Victor Emmanuel--favor settled eventually upon the last named, who\r\nwas elected November 19, 1870, by a vote of 191 to 120. At the end of\r\n1870 the new sovereign arrived in Spain, and February 2, 1871, he took\r\noath to uphold the recently established constitution. From the outset,\r\nhowever, his position was one of extreme difficulty. He was opposed by\r\nthose who desired a republic, by the Carlists, by the adherents of the\r\nformer crown prince Alfonso, and by the clergy; and as a foreigner he\r\nwas regarded with indifference, if not antipathy, by patriotic\r\nSpaniards generally. February 10, 1873, wearied by the turbulence in\r\nwhich he was engulfed, he resigned his powers into the hands of the\r\nCortes, and by that body his abdication was forthwith accepted. It is\r\na sufficient commentary upon the political character of the reign to\r\nobserve that within the twenty-four months which it covered there were\r\nno fewer than six ministerial crises and three general elections.\r\n\r\n*674. The Republic (1873-1875): Monarchy Restored.*--The breakdown of\r\nthe elective monarchy, following thus closely the overthrow of\r\nabsolutism, cleared the way for the triumph of the republicans. The\r\nmonarchist parties, confronted suddenly by an unanticipated situation,\r\nwere able to agree upon no plan of action, and the upshot was that, by\r\na vote of 258 to 32, the Cortes declared for a republic and decreed\r\nthat the drafting of a republican constitution should be undertaken by\r\na specially elected convention. Although it was true, as Castelar\r\nasserted, that the monarchy had perished from natural causes, that the\r\nrepublic was the inevitable product of existing circumstance, and that\r\nthe transition from the one to the other was effected without\r\nbloodshed, it was apparent from the outset that republicanism had not,\r\nafter all, struck root deeply. A constitution was drawn up, but it was\r\nat no time really put into operation. The supporters of the new régime\r\nwere far from agreed as to the kind of republic, federal or        (p. 610)\r\ncentralized, that should be established;[843] the republican leaders\r\nwere mutually jealous and prone to profitless theorizing; the nation\r\nwas lacking in the experience which is a prerequisite of\r\nself-government.[844] At home the republic was opposed by the\r\nmonarchists of the various groups, by the clergy, and by the extreme\r\nparticularists, and abroad it won the recognition of not one nation\r\nsave the United States. The presidency of Figueras lasted four months;\r\nthat of Pi y Margall, six weeks; that of Salmeron, a similar period;\r\nthat of Castelar, about four months (September 7, 1873, to January 3,\r\n1874). Castelar, however, was rather a dictator than a president, and\r\nso was his Conservative successor Serrano. By the beginning of 1874 it\r\nwas admitted universally that the only escape from the anomalous\r\nsituation in which the nation found itself lay in a restoration of the\r\nlegitimist monarchy, in the person of Don Alfonso, son of Isabella II.\r\nThe collapse of the republic was as swift and as noiseless as had been\r\nits establishment. The principal agency in it was the army, which, in\r\nDecember, 1874, declared definitely for Alfonso, after he had pledged\r\nhimself to a grant of amnesty and the maintenance of constitutional\r\ngovernment. December 31 a regency ministry under the presidency of\r\nCánovas was announced, and the new reign began with the landing of the\r\nyoung sovereign at Barcelona, January 10, 1875. Between the premature\r\nand ineffective republicanism of the past year, on the one hand, and\r\nthe absolutism of a Carlist government, on the other, the\r\nconstitutional monarchy of Alfonso XII. seemed a logical, and to the\r\nmass of the Spanish people, an eminently satisfactory, compromise.[845]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 843: Castelar favored a consolidated and\r\n                   radical republic; Serrano, a consolidated and\r\n                   conservative republic; Pi y Margall, a federal\r\n                   republic, on the pattern of the United States;\r\n                   Pavia, a republic which should be predominantly\r\n                   military.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 844: In this connection may be mentioned\r\n                   a remark of General Prim, one of the leading\r\n                   spirits in the provisional government of 1868. When\r\n                   asked why at that time he did not establish a\r\n                   republic his reply was: \"It would have been a\r\n                   republic without republicans.\" There was no less a\r\n                   dearth of real republicans in 1873-1874.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 845: On the revolutionary and republican\r\n                   periods see Cambridge Modern History XI., Chap. 20\r\n                   (bibliography, pp. 945-949); Lavisse et Rambaud,\r\n                   Histoire Générale, XII., Chap. 9; Hume, Modern\r\n                   Spain, Chap. 10; V.

THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION                                      (p. 611)\r\n\r\n*675. The Constitution Adopted.*--The year following the\r\nre-establishment of the monarchy was consumed largely in the\r\nsuppression of the Carlists and the reorganization of the government.\r\nDuring this period Cánovas, at the head of a strong Conservative and\r\nClerical ministry, ruled virtually as a dictator, and sooner or later\r\nmost vestiges of the republic were swept away, while the nation was\r\nwon over solidly to the new order. At the election of the first Cortes\r\nof the Restoration, January 22, 1876, the principle of manhood\r\nsuffrage was continued in operation, though so docile did the\r\nelectorate prove that Cánovas was able to secure, in both chambers, a\r\nheavy majority which was ready to vote at the Government's behest a\r\nfranchise system of a much less liberal type. The first important task\r\nof this Cortes was the consideration and adoption of a new national\r\nconstitution. As to the sort of constitution most desirable there was,\r\nas ever, wide difference of opinion. The Conservatives favored a\r\nrevival of the instrument of 1845. The Liberals much preferred a\r\nrestoration of that of 1869. A commission of thirty-nine, designated\r\nMay 20, 1875, by a junta convened by Cánovas, had evolved with some\r\ndifficulty an instrument which combined various features of both of\r\nthese earlier documents, and by the Cortes of 1876 this proposed\r\nconstitution was at length accorded definite, though by no means\r\nunanimous, assent (June 30). This instrument was put forthwith into\r\noperation, and it has remained to this day, substantially without\r\nalteration, the fundamental law of Spain. Based essentially upon the\r\nconstitution of 1845, it none the less exhibits at many points the\r\ninfluence of the liberal principles which underlay the instrument of\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n*676. Contents: Guarantees of Individual Liberty.*--In scope the\r\nconstitution is comprehensive. Its text falls into thirteen \"titles\"\r\nand eighty-nine articles. Like the constitution of Italy, it contains\r\nno provision for its own amendment; but in Spain, as also in Italy,\r\nthe distinction between constituent and legislative powers is not\r\nsharply drawn and a simple act of the legislative body is in practice\r\nadequate to modify the working constitution of the kingdom. Among the\r\nthirteen titles one of the most elaborate is that in which are defined\r\nthe rights and privileges of Spanish subjects and of aliens resident\r\nin Spain.[846] Among rights specifically guaranteed are those of\r\nfreedom of speech, freedom of the press, peaceful assemblage, the\r\nformation of associations, petition, unrestrained choice of professions,\r\nand eligibility to public offices and employments, \"according to   (p. 612)\r\nmerit and capacity.\" Immunities guaranteed include exemption from\r\narrest, \"except in the cases and in the manner prescribed by law\";\r\nexemption from imprisonment, except upon order of a competent judicial\r\nofficial; freedom from molestation on account of religious opinions,\r\nprovided due respect for \"Christian morality\" be shown;[847] and\r\nexemption from search of papers and effects and from confiscation of\r\nproperty, save by authority legally competent. It is forbidden that\r\neither the military or the civil authorities shall impose any penalty\r\nother than such as shall have been established previously by law.\r\nCertain guarantees, i.e., those respecting arrest, imprisonment,\r\nsearch, freedom of domicile, freedom of speech and press, assemblage,\r\nand associations, may, under provision of the constitution, be\r\nsuspended throughout the kingdom or in any portion thereof, but only\r\nwhen demanded by the security of the state, and then only temporarily\r\nand by means of a specific law. In no case may any other guarantee\r\nwhich is named in the constitution be withdrawn, even temporarily.\r\nWhen the Cortes is not in session the Government may suspend, through\r\nthe medium of a royal decree, any one of the guarantees which the\r\nCortes itself is authorized to suspend, but at the earliest\r\nopportunity such a decree must be submitted to the Cortes for\r\nratification. It need hardly be pointed out that the opportunity for\r\nthe evasion of constitutionalism which is created by this power of\r\nsuspension is enormous, and anyone at all familiar with the history of\r\npublic affairs in Spain would be able to cite numerous occasions upon\r\nwhich, upon pretexts more or less plausible, the guarantees of the\r\nfundamental law have been set at naught.[848]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 846: No. 1.

THE CROWN AND THE MINISTRY                                     (p. 613)\r\n\r\n*677. The Rules of Succession.*--Executive power in the kingdom is\r\nvested solely in the crown, although in practice it devolves to a\r\nlarge degree upon the council of ministers. Kingship is hereditary,\r\nand in regulation of the succession the constitution lays down the\r\ngeneral principle that an elder line shall always be preferred to\r\nyounger ones; in the same line, the nearer degree of kinship to the\r\nmore remote; in the same degree of kinship, the male to the female; in\r\nthe same sex, the older to the younger person. By the original\r\nconstitution Alfonso XII. was declared to be the legitimate sovereign,\r\nand provision was made that if the line of legitimate descendants of\r\nAlfonso should be extinguished, his sisters should succeed in the\r\nestablished order; then his aunt (the sister of his mother Isabella\r\nII.) and her legitimate descendants; and, finally, the descendants of\r\nhis uncles, the brothers of Ferdinand VII.[849] It will be recalled\r\nthat the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 abolished in Spain the Salic\r\nprinciple and restored the ancient right of females to inherit. Spain\r\nis, indeed, one of the few European states in which this right exists.\r\nAt the same time, as has been pointed out, when the degree of kinship\r\nis identical, preference is accorded the male. Thus it came about that\r\nthe present sovereign, Alfonso XIII., the posthumous son of Alfonso\r\nXII., took precedence over his two sisters, both of whom were older\r\nthan he, and the elder of whom, Maria de las Mercedes, actually was\r\nqueen from the death of her father, November 25, 1885, until the birth\r\nof her brother, May 17, 1886.[850]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 849: Arts. 59-61. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 211.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 850: She was, however, but a child five\r\n                   years of age.]\r\n\r\n*678. Regencies.*--Any member of the royal family who may be incapable\r\nof governing, or who by his conduct may have forfeited his claim to the\r\ngood-will of the nation, may be excluded from the succession by    (p. 614)\r\nlaw. Disputes concerning rights or facts involved in the succession\r\nare to be adjusted by law, and in event that all of the family lines\r\nmentioned in the constitution should be extinguished it would become\r\nthe duty of the Cortes to make such disposal of the crown as might be\r\nadjudged \"most suitable to the nation.\"[851] Both the sovereign and\r\nthe heir presumptive are forbidden to marry any person who by law is\r\nexcluded from the succession. They are, indeed, forbidden to contract\r\na marriage at all until after the Cortes shall have examined and\r\napproved the stipulations involved. The age of majority of the\r\nsovereign is fixed at sixteen years. When the king is a minor, his\r\nfather or his mother, or, in default of a living parent, the relative\r\nwho stands next in the order of succession, is constituted regent,\r\nprovided always that such person be a Spaniard at least twenty years\r\nof age and not by law excluded from the succession. Should there be no\r\none upon whom the regency may lawfully devolve, it is the duty of the\r\nCortes to appoint a regency of one, three, or five persons. If, at any\r\ntime, in the judgment of the Cortes, the sovereign becomes\r\nincapacitated to rule, a regency is required to be vested in the crown\r\nprince, provided he be sixteen years of age. In default of a qualified\r\ncrown prince the regency devolves upon the queen; and in default of\r\nboth son and queen, upon a person determined in accordance with the\r\nrules already mentioned.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 851: Art. 62. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 212.]\r\n\r\n*679. Powers of the Crown.*--The powers of the crown are of the sort\r\ncommon among continental monarchies. By the constitution they are\r\nthrown into two groups, i.e., those which may be exercised freely and\r\nindependently and those which may be exercised only upon the\r\nauthorization of a special law. Enumeration of the first group begins\r\nwith the sweeping statement that \"the power of executing the laws is\r\nvested in the king, and his authority extends to everything which\r\nconduces to the preservation of public order at home and the security\r\nof the state abroad, in conformity with the constitution and the\r\nlaws.\"[852] Powers specifically named include the approval and\r\npromulgation of the laws; the issuing of decrees, regulations, and\r\ninstructions designed to facilitate the execution of the laws; the\r\nappointment and dismissal of ministers and of civil officials\r\ngenerally; command of the army and navy and direction of the land and\r\nnaval forces; the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace;[853]\r\nthe conduct of diplomatic and commercial relations with foreign\r\nstates; the pardoning of offenders; the control of the coinage;    (p. 615)\r\nand the conferring of honors and distinctions of every kind. Of powers\r\nwhich the sovereign may exercise only in pursuance of authority\r\nspecially conferred by law there are five, as follows: alienation,\r\ncession, or exchange of any portion of Spanish territory; incorporation\r\nof new territory; admission of foreign troops into the kingdom;\r\nratification of all treaties which are binding individually upon\r\nSpaniards, and of treaties of offensive alliance which stipulate the\r\npayment of subsidies to any foreign power, or which relate especially\r\nto commerce; and abdication of the crown in favor of the\r\nheir-presumptive.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 852: Art. 50. Ibid., II., 210.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 853: It is required that subsequent to a\r\n                   declaration of war or the conclusion of peace the\r\n                   king shall submit to the Cortes a report\r\n                   accompanied by pertinent documents.]\r\n\r\n*680. The Ministry: Organization and Functions.*--In Spain, as in\r\nconstitutional states generally, the powers appertaining to the\r\nexecutive are exercised in the main by the ministers. Concerning the\r\nministry the constitution has little to say. It, in truth, assumes,\r\nrather than makes specific provision for, the ministry's existence. It\r\nconfers upon the crown the power freely to appoint and to dismiss\r\nministers; it stipulates that ministers may be senators or deputies\r\nand may participate in the proceedings of both legislative chambers,\r\nbut may vote only in the chambers to which they belong; and, most\r\nimportant of all, it enjoins that ministers shall be responsible, and\r\nthat no order of the king may be executed unless countersigned by a\r\nminister, who thereby assumes personal responsibility for it. This\r\nprinciple of ministerial responsibility, which found its first\r\nexpression in Spain in the constitution of 1812, is enforced nowadays\r\nsufficiently, at least, to ensure the nation, through the Cortes, some\r\nactual control over the policies and measures of the executive. Of\r\nministries there are at present nine, as follows: Foreign Affairs;\r\nJustice; Finance; War; Marine; Interior; Public Instruction and Fine\r\nArts; Commerce; and Public Works. At the head of the ministerial\r\ncouncil is a president, or premier, who, under royal approval, selects\r\nhis colleagues, but ordinarily assumes himself no portfolio. It is the\r\nfunction of the ministers not only to serve as the heads of executive\r\ndepartments and to explain and defend in the legislative chambers the\r\nacts of the government, but, in their collective capacity, to\r\nformulate measures for presentation to the Cortes and, especially, to\r\nsubmit every year for examination and discussion a general budget,\r\naccompanied by a scheme of taxation or other proposed means of meeting\r\nprospective expenditures. In each chamber there is reserved for the\r\nministers of the crown a front bench to the right of the presiding\r\nofficial. The practice of interpellation exists, although ministries\r\nrarely retire by reason of a vote of censure arising therefrom. But any\r\nminister may be impeached by the Congress before the Senate. In Spain,\r\nas in France and Italy, the parliamentary system is nominally in   (p. 616)\r\noperation; but, as in the countries mentioned, the multiplicity and\r\ninstability of party groups render the workings of the system totally\r\ndifferent from what they are in Great Britain. Ministries are\r\ninvariably composite rather than homogeneous in political complexion,\r\nwith the consequence that they are unable to present a solid front or\r\nlong to retain their hold upon the nation's confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE CORTES\r\n\r\n*681. The Senate: Composition.*--The legislative powers of the kingdom\r\nare vested in \"the Cortes, together with the king.\" The Cortes\r\nconsists of two co-ordinate chambers, the Senate and the Congress of\r\nDeputies. In the composition of the Senate the prescriptive,\r\nappointive, and elective principles are curiously intertwined, the\r\nchamber containing one group of men who are members in their own\r\nright, another who are appointed by the crown and sit for life, and a\r\nthird who are elected by the corporations of the state and by the\r\nlarge taxpayers. In number the first two categories jointly may not\r\nexceed 180; the third is fixed definitely at that figure. In point of\r\nfact the life senators nominated by the crown number 100, while the\r\nquota of prescriptive members varies considerably. This last-mentioned\r\ngroup comprises grown sons of the sovereign and of the heir-presumptive;\r\nthe admirals of the navy and the captains-general of the army; the\r\npatriarch of the Indies and the archbishops; the presidents of the\r\nCouncil of State, the Supreme Court, the Court of Accounts, and the\r\nSupreme Councils of War and Marine, after two years of service; and\r\ngrandees of Spain[854] in their own right, who are not subjects of\r\nanother power and who have a proved yearly income of 60,000 pesetas\r\n($12,000) derived from real property of their own, or from rights\r\nlegally equivalent to real property.[855]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 854: The rank of grandee (_grande_) is a\r\n                   dignity conferred by the sovereign, either for life\r\n                   or as an hereditary honor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 855: Art. 21. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 204].\r\n\r\n*682. Appointment and Election of Senators.*--Appointment of senators by\r\nthe crown is made by special decree, in which must be stated the\r\ngrounds upon which each appointment is based. In the selection of\r\nappointees the sovereign is not entirely free, but since the constitution\r\ndesignates no fewer than twelve classes from which appointments may be\r\nmade, the range of choice is large. Among the categories enumerated\r\nare the presidents of the legislative chambers; deputies who have been\r\nmembers of as many as three congresses, or who have served during as\r\nmany as eight sessions; ministers of the crown; bishops; grandees;\r\nlieutenant-generals of the army and vice-admirals of the navy, of  (p. 617)\r\ntwo years' standing; ambassadors, after two years of active service,\r\nand ministers plenipotentiary, after four years; presidents and\r\ndirectors of the half-dozen royal academies, and persons who in point\r\nof seniority belong within the first half of the list of members of\r\nthese respective bodies; head professors in the universities, who have\r\nheld this rank and have performed the duties pertaining to it through\r\na period of four years; and a variety of other administrative,\r\njudicial, and professional functionaries. Persons belonging to any one\r\nof these groups, however, are eligible for appointment only in the\r\nevent that they enjoy an annual income of 7,500 pesetas ($1,500),\r\nderived from property of their own or from salaries of permanent\r\nemployments, or from pensions or retirement allowances. In addition to\r\nthe classes mentioned persons are eligible who for two years have\r\npossessed an annual income of 20,000 pesetas, or who have paid into\r\nthe public treasury a direct tax of 4,000 pesetas, provided that in\r\naddition they possess titles of nobility, or have been members of the\r\nCortes, provincial deputies, or mayors in capitals of provinces or in\r\ntowns of more than 20,000 inhabitants. Appointments are made regularly\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the quota of 180 elected senators are\r\nchosen were defined by a statute of February 8, 1877. One senator is\r\nchosen by the clergy in each of the nine archbishoprics; one by each\r\nof the six royal academies; one by each of the ten universities; five\r\nby the economic societies; and the remaining 150 by electoral colleges\r\nin the several provinces. The electoral college is composed of members\r\nof the provincial deputations and of representatives chosen from among\r\nthe municipal councillors and largest taxpayers of the towns and\r\nmunicipal districts. But no one may become a senator by election who\r\nwould be ineligible, under the conditions above mentioned, to be\r\nappointed to a seat by the crown. And it is required in all cases that\r\nto become a senator one must be a Spaniard, must have attained the age\r\nof thirty-five, must have the free management of his property, and\r\nmust not have been subjected to criminal proceedings, nor have been\r\ndeprived of the exercise of his political rights. The term of elected\r\nsenators is ten years. One-half of the number is renewed every five\r\nyears; but upon a dissolution of the elected portion of the chamber by\r\nthe crown, the quota is renewed integrally.[856]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 856: Arts. 20-26. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 203-206.]\r\n\r\n*683. The Congress of Deputies: Composition and Election.*--The lower\r\nlegislative chamber is composed of deputies chosen directly by the\r\ninhabitants of the several electoral districts into which the kingdom\r\nis divided. From the adoption of the present constitution until 1890\r\nthe franchise was restricted severely by property qualifications.  (p. 618)\r\nA reform bill which became law June 29, 1890, however, re-established\r\nin effect the scheme of manhood suffrage which had been in operation\r\nduring the revolutionary epoch 1869-1875. Under the provisions of a\r\nlaw of August 8, 1907, by which the electoral system was further\r\nregulated, the franchise is conferred upon all male Spaniards who have\r\nattained the age of twenty-five, who have resided in their electoral\r\ndistrict not less than two years, and who have not been deprived\r\njudicially of their civil rights.[857] Except, indeed, in the case of\r\ncertain judicial officials and of persons more than seventy years of\r\nage, the exercise of the voting privilege is, as in Belgium and in\r\nsome of the Austrian provinces, compulsory. The constitution requires\r\nthat there shall be at least one deputy for every 50,000 inhabitants.\r\nThe total membership of the Congress is at present 406. In the\r\nmajority of districts but a single deputy is chosen, but in\r\ntwenty-eight of the larger ones two or more are elected by _scrutin de\r\nliste_, with provision for the representation of minorities. In\r\ndistricts in which two or three deputies are to be chosen, each\r\nelector votes for one fewer than the number to be elected; in\r\ndistricts where from four to seven are to be chosen, the elector votes\r\nfor two fewer than the total number; and where the aggregate number is\r\neight to ten, or more than ten, he votes for three or four fewer,\r\nrespectively. Any Spaniard who is qualified for the exercise of the\r\nsuffrage is eligible for election, and for indefinite re-election, as\r\na deputy, save that no member of the clergy may be chosen. The term of\r\nmembership is five years, though by reason of not infrequent\r\ndissolutions the period of service is actually briefer. As is true\r\nalso of senators, deputies receive no pay for their services.[858]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 857: There is the customary regulation\r\n                   that soldiers and sailors in active service may not\r\n                   vote.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 858: J. Vila Serra, Manual de elecciones\r\n                   de Diputados a Cortes (Valencia, 1907); J.

San\r\n                   Martin, La reforma electoral (Madrid, 1907).]\r\n\r\n*684. Sessions and Status of the Chambers.*--The Cortes, consisting thus\r\nof the Senate and the Congress of Deputies, is required by the\r\nconstitution to be convened by the crown in regular session at least\r\nonce each year. Extraordinary sessions may be held, and upon the death\r\nor incapacitation of the sovereign the chambers must be assembled\r\nforthwith. To the crown belongs the power not only to convene, but\r\nalso to suspend and to terminate the sessions, and to dissolve,\r\nsimultaneously or separately, the Congress and the elective portion of\r\nthe Senate. In the event, however, of a dissolution, the sovereign is\r\nobliged to convene the newly constituted Cortes within the space of\r\nthree months. Except when it devolves upon the Senate to exercise  (p. 619)\r\nits purely judicial functions, neither of the chambers may be\r\nassembled without the other. In no case may the two chambers sit as a\r\nsingle assembly, or deliberate in the presence of the sovereign. Each\r\nbody is authorized to judge the qualifications of its members and to\r\nframe and adopt its own rules of procedure. The Senate elects its\r\nsecretaries, but its president and vice-president are designated, for\r\neach session, and from the senators themselves, by the crown. The\r\nCongress, on the other hand, elects from its membership all of its own\r\nofficials. Sessions of both chambers are public, though \"when secrecy\r\nis necessary\" the doors may be closed. A majority of the members\r\nconstitutes a quorum, and measures are passed by a majority vote. No\r\nsenator or deputy may be held to account by legal process for any\r\nopinion uttered or for any vote cast within the chamber to which he\r\nbelongs; and, save when taken in the commission of an offense, a\r\nmember is entitled to all of the safeguards against arrest and\r\njudicial proceedings which are extended customarily to members of\r\nlegislative bodies in constitutional states.[859]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 859: It is to be observed that these\r\n                   guarantees are not quite absolute. During the\r\n                   crisis of 1904 the Maura government required the\r\n                   Congress to suspend the legislative immunity of no\r\n                   fewer than 140 members, and for the first time\r\n                   since 1834 deputies were handed over to the courts\r\n                   to be tried for offenses of a purely political\r\n                   character.]\r\n\r\n*685. Functions and Powers of the Cortes.*--The function of the Cortes\r\nis primarily legislative. Each chamber shares with the crown the right\r\nto initiate measures, and no proposal can become law until it has\r\nreceived the sanction of the two houses. Rejection of a bill by either\r\nchamber, or by the crown, precludes the possibility of a reappearance\r\nof the project during the continuance of the session. Measures\r\nrelating to taxation and to the public credit must be presented, in\r\nthe first instance, in the Congress of Deputies, and it is made the\r\nspecific obligation of the Government every year to lay before that\r\nbody for examination and approval a budget of revenues and\r\nexpenditures. Only upon authority of law may the Government alienate\r\nproperty belonging to the state, or borrow money on the public credit.\r\nUnder Spanish constitutional theory the Cortes is the agent of the\r\nsovereign nation. It is authorized, therefore, not only to discharge\r\nthe usual functions of legislation but also to do three other things\r\nof fundamental importance. In the first place, it receives from the\r\nsovereign, from the heir-apparent, and from the regent or regency of\r\nthe kingdom, the oath of fidelity to the constitution and the laws. In\r\nthe second place, under provisions contained within the constitution,\r\nit elects the regent or regency and appoints a guardian for a      (p. 620)\r\nminor sovereign. Finally, to maintain the responsibility of ministers\r\nto the lower chamber, and, through it, to the nation, the Congress is\r\nauthorized to impeach, and the Senate to try, at any time any member\r\nof the Government.[860]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 860: Arts. 32-47. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 207-209.

POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n*686. Party Groups After 1869.*--Since the dawn of constitutionalism\r\npolitical life in Spain has comprised much of the time a sheer game\r\nbetween the \"ins\" and the \"outs\", in which issues have counted for\r\nlittle and the schemings of the caciques, or professional wire-pullers\r\nand bosses, have counted for well-nigh everything. For the exercise of\r\nindependent popular judgment upon fundamental political questions\r\naptitude has been meager and opportunity rare. Political parties there\r\nhave been, and still are, and certain of them have exhibited distinct\r\npower of survival. Yet it must be observed that even the stablest of\r\nthem are essentially the creatures of the political leaders and that\r\nat no time have they exhibited the broadly national rootage of\r\npolitical parties in other states of western Europe.\r\n\r\nParty cleavages in Spain had their beginning early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, but for the origins of the groups which share in an important\r\nmanner nowadays in the politics of the kingdom it is not necessary to\r\nreturn to a period more remote than that of the revolution of 1868.\r\nSubsequent to the expulsion of Queen Isabella at least four groups\r\nwere thrown into more or less sharp relief. One was the Carlists,\r\nsupporters of the claims of Don Carlos and, in respect to political\r\nprinciple, avowed absolutists. A second comprised the Republicans, led\r\nby Castelar, whose demand for the establishment of a republic,\r\nrejected in 1869, carried the day upon the breakdown of the Amadeo\r\nmonarchy four years later. Between the Carlists, on the one hand, and\r\nthe Republicans, on the other, stood the mass of the political\r\nleaders, and, so far as may be judged, of the nation also. All were\r\nagreed upon the general principle of constitutional monarchy. But upon\r\nthe precise nature of the government which had been established and of\r\nthe public policy which ought to be pursued there was, and could be,\r\nlittle agreement. The consequence was a sharp-cut cleavage, by which\r\nthere were set off in opposition to each other two large parties,\r\nthe Conservatives and the Liberals; and, save for the brief        (p. 621)\r\nascendancy of the Republicans in 1873-1874, it is these two parties\r\nwhich have shared between them the government of the kingdom from the\r\nestablishment of the limited monarchy in 1869 to the present day. Both\r\nof these leading parties have been pledged continuously to maintain\r\nthe constitution and all of the popular privileges--freedom of speech,\r\nliberty of the press, safety of property, the right of establishing\r\nassociations, and the like--guaranteed by that instrument. Upon the\r\n_methods_ by which these things shall be maintained the parties\r\noriginally divided and still are disagreed. Fundamentally, the policy\r\nof the Liberals is to commit the guardianship of public privileges to\r\nthe courts of justice, while that of the Conservatives is to retain it\r\nrather in the hands of the ministerial and administrative authorities.\r\nIn the normal course of development the Liberal party has tended to\r\ndraw to itself those liberal elements generally which are satisfied to\r\nrely upon legal means for the realization of their purposes, e.g.,\r\nthe free-traders, the labor forces, and many of the socialists.\r\nSimilarly the Conservative party has attracted a considerable\r\nproportion of the reactionaries, especially the Ultramontanes, by whom\r\nspecial stress is placed upon the maintenance of peace with the\r\nVatican, and many representatives of the old Moderate party which was\r\nswept out of existence by the overturn of 1868.\r\n\r\n*687. Liberals and Conservatives: Cánovas and Sagasta.*--The first\r\npublic act of Alfonso XII., following his proclamation as king,\r\nDecember 29, 1874, was to call to his side in the capacity of premier\r\nCánovas del Castillo, by whom was formed a strong Conservative\r\nministry. Consequent upon the convocation of the Cortes of 1876 and\r\nthe adoption of the new constitution of that year, the various groups\r\nof Liberals were drawn into a fairly compact opposition party,\r\nsupporting the Alfonsist dynasty and the new constitutional régime,\r\nbut proposing to labor, by peaceful means, for the restoration of as\r\nmany as possible of the more liberal features of the constitution of\r\n1869. It is of interest to observe that the party, in its earlier\r\nyears, was encouraged by Cánovas, on the theory that there would be\r\nprovided by it a natural and harmless outlet for inevitable\r\nebullitions of the liberal spirit. Under the able leadership of\r\nSagasta the development of the party was rapid, and in 1881 Cánovas\r\ndetermined to give the country a taste of Liberal rule. Following a\r\ncollusive \"defeat\" the premier retired, whereupon Sagasta was\r\ndesignated premier and a Liberal ministry was established which held\r\noffice somewhat more than two years. By the Republicans and other\r\nradical forces the ministry of Sagasta was harassed unsparingly, just\r\nas had been that of Cánovas, and the actual working policies of    (p. 622)\r\nthe two differed in scarcely any particular. Within the Liberal ranks,\r\nindeed, a \"dynastic Left\" became so troublesome that Sagasta, after\r\ntwo years, yielded office to the leader of the disaffected elements,\r\nPosada Herrera. The only effect of the experiment was to demonstrate\r\nthat between the Conservatives led by Cánovas and the Liberals led by\r\nSagasta there was no room for a third party.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Cánovas returned to power, but for only a brief interval, for\r\nupon the establishment of the regency of Queen Christina, following\r\nthe death of Alfonso XII., November 25, 1885, Sagasta was called upon\r\nto form the first of a series of ministries over which he presided\r\ncontinuously through the ensuing five years. In the memorable Pact of\r\nEl Pardo it had been agreed between the Liberal and Conservative\r\nleaders that each would assist the other in the defense of the dynasty\r\nand of the constitution, and although Sagasta had avowed the intention\r\nof reintroducing certain principles of the constitution of 1869 he was\r\npledged to proceed in a cautious manner and a conciliatory spirit. The\r\nelections of 1884 yielded a substantial Conservative majority in both\r\nchambers of the Cortes. None the less the Conservatives accorded the\r\nLiberal government their support, until by the elections of 1886 the\r\nLiberals themselves acquired control of the two houses. Throughout\r\nthree years Castelar and the more moderate Republicans co-operated\r\nactively with the Government in the re-introduction of jury trial, the\r\nrevival of liberty of the press, and a number of other liberal\r\nmeasures; but the Government was annoyed continually by attacks and\r\nintrigues participated in by both the less conciliatory Republicans\r\nand the Carlists. The crowning achievement of the Sagasta ministry was\r\nthe carrying through of the manhood suffrage act of June 29, 1890.\r\nWithin a month after the promulgation of the suffrage law the regent\r\ngave Sagasta to understand that the time had arrived for a change of\r\nleaders. The Cánovas ministry which was thereupon established endured\r\ntwo and a half years, and was given distinction principally by its\r\nintroduction, in 1892, of the thoroughgoing protectionist régime which\r\nprevails in Spain to-day. The Conservatives falling into discord,\r\nCánovas resigned, December 8, 1892; and at the elections of the\r\nfollowing year the Conservatives carried only one hundred seats in the\r\nChamber. During the period from December, 1892, to March, 1895,\r\nSagasta was again at the helm.\r\n\r\n*688. The American War and Ministerial Changes, 1895-1902.*--Between\r\n1895 and 1901 there was a rapid succession of ministries, virtually\r\nall of which were both made and unmade by situations arising from  (p. 623)\r\nthe war in Cuba and the subsequent contest with the United States. In\r\nthe hope of averting American intervention a new Cánovas government,\r\nestablished in 1895, brought forward a measure for the introduction of\r\nhome rule in Cuba, but while the bill was pending, Cánovas was\r\nassassinated, August 9, 1897, and the proposition failed. The new\r\nConservative cabinet of General Azcarraga soon retired, and although\r\nthe Sagasta government which succeeded recalled General Weyler from\r\nCuba and inaugurated a policy of conciliation, the situation had got\r\nbeyond control and war with the United States ensued. By the\r\nsuccession of Spanish defeats the popularity of the Liberal régime was\r\nstrained to the breaking point, and at the close of the war Sagasta's\r\nministry gave place to a ministry formed by the new Conservative\r\nleader Silvela. The elections of April 16, 1899, yielded the\r\nSilvelists a majority and the ministry, reconstituted September 28 of\r\nthe same year, retained power until March 6, 1901. At that date the\r\nLiberals gained the upper hand once more; and, with two brief\r\nintervals, Sagasta remained in office until December 3, 1902. Within\r\nscarcely more than a month after his final retirement, the great\r\nLiberal leader passed away.\r\n\r\n*689. Parties Since the Death of Sagasta.*--A second Silvela ministry,\r\nestablished December 6, 1902, brought the Conservatives again into\r\npower. This ministry, which lasted but a few months, was followed\r\nsuccessively by four other Conservative governments, as follows: that\r\nof Villaverde, May, 1903, to December, 1903; that of Antonio Maura y\r\nMontanes, December, 1903, to December, 1904; the second of General\r\nAzcarraga, December, 1904, to January, 1905; and the second of\r\nVillaverde, from January, 1905, to June, 1905. Of these the most\r\nvirile was that of Maura, a former Liberal, whose spirit of\r\nconciliation and progressiveness entitled him to be considered one of\r\nthe few real statesmen of Spain in the present generation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the death of Sagasta the Liberals passed through a period of\r\ndemoralization, but under the leadership of Montero Rios they\r\ngradually recovered, and in June, 1905, the government of Villaverde\r\nwas succeeded by one presided over by Rios. At the elections of\r\nSeptember 10, 1905, the Ministerialists secured 227 seats and the\r\nConservatives of all groups but 126 (the remainder being scattered);\r\nbut discord arose and, November 29 following, the cabinet of Rios\r\nresigned. Upon the great ecclesiastical questions of the day--civil\r\nmarriage, the law of associations, and the secularization of\r\neducation--both parties, but especially the Liberals, were disrupted\r\ncompletely, and during the period of but little more than a year between\r\nthe retirement of Rios and the return to power of Maura, January 24,\r\n1907, no fewer than five ministries sought successively to grapple (p. 624)\r\nwith the situation. Under Maura a measure of stability was restored.\r\nThe premier, although a Catholic, was moderately anti-clerical. His\r\nprincipal purpose was to maintain order and to elevate the plane of\r\npolitics by a reform of the local government. At the elections of\r\nApril 21, 1907, the Conservatives won a victory so decisive that in\r\nthe Congress they secured a majority of 88 seats over all other groups\r\ncombined.[861] The fall of the Maura ministry, October 21, 1909, came\r\nin consequence largely of the Moroccan crisis, but more immediately\r\nby reason of embarrassment incident to the execution of the\r\nanarchist-philosopher Señor Ferrer. The Liberal ministry of Moret,\r\nconstituted October 22, 1909, lacked substantial parliamentary support\r\nand was short-lived. February 9, 1910, there was established under\r\nCanalejas, leader of the democratic group, a cabinet representative of\r\nvarious Liberal and Radical elements and made up almost wholly of men\r\nnew to ministerial office.[862]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 861: The exact distribution of seats was\r\n                   as follows: Conservatives, 256; Liberals, 66;\r\n                   Solidarists, 53; Republicans, 32; Democrats, 9;\r\n                   Independents, 8.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 862: November 12, 1912, Premier Canalejas\r\n                   was assassinated. He was succeeded by the president\r\n                   of the Congress of Deputies, Alvaro de Romanones,\r\n                   under whom the Liberal ministry was continued in\r\n                   office.]\r\n\r\n*690. The Elections of 1910.*--The first important act of Canalejas was\r\nto persuade the sovereign, as Moret had vainly sought to do, to\r\ndissolve the Cortes, to the end that the Liberal ministry might appeal\r\nto the country. The elections were held May 10. They were of peculiar\r\ninterest by reason of the fact that now for the first time there was\r\nput into operation an electoral measure of the recent Maura government\r\nwhereby it is required that every candidate for a seat in the lower\r\nchamber shall be placed in nomination by two ex-senators, two\r\nex-deputies, or three members of the general council of the province.\r\nThis regulation had been opposed by the Republicans and by the radical\r\nelements generally on the ground that it put in the hands of the\r\nGovernment power virtually to dictate candidacies in many electoral\r\ndistricts, and the results seemed fairly to sustain the charge. May 1,\r\nin accordance with a provision of the law, 120 deputies--upwards of\r\none-third of the total number to be chosen--were declared elected, by\r\nreason of having no competitors. Of these 70 were Liberals, 39 were\r\nConservatives, and the remainder belonged to minor groups. In the\r\ndistricts in which there were contests the Government also won\r\ndecisively a few days later, as it did likewise in the senatorial\r\nelections of May 15.

Republicanism and Socialism.*--Among other accounts, the elections\r\nof 1910 were notable by reason of the return to the Congress for the\r\nfirst time of a socialist member. In Madrid, as in other centers of\r\npopulation, the Government concluded with the Conservatives an\r\n_entente_ calculated to hold in check the rising tide of socialism and\r\nrepublicanism. Under the stimulus thus afforded the Socialists at last\r\nresponded to the overtures which the Republicans had long been making,\r\nand the coalition which resulted was successful in returning to\r\nParliament the Socialist leader Iglesias, together with an otherwise\r\nall but unbroken contingent of Republicans. In Barcelona and elsewhere\r\nRepublican gains were decisive. None the less the Republican forces\r\ncontinue to be so embarrassed by factional strife as to be not really\r\nformidable. The Socialists, however, exhibit a larger degree of unity.\r\nAs in Italy, France, and most European countries, they are growing\r\nboth in numbers and in effectiveness of organization. In Spain, as in\r\nItaly, the historic parties which have been accustomed to share\r\nbetween them the control of the state have, in reality, long since\r\nlost much of the vitality which they once possessed. The terms\r\n\"Liberal\" and \"Conservative\" denote even less than once they did\r\nbodies of men standing for recognized political principles, or even\r\nfor recognized political policies. The field for the development of\r\nparties which shall take more cognizance of the nation's actual\r\nconditions and be more responsive to its demands seems wide and, on\r\nthe whole, not unpromising.[864]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 864: On political parties in Spain two\r\n                   older works are A.

THE JUDICIARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT                            (p. 626)\r\n\r\n*692. Law and Justice.*--The law of Spain is founded upon the Roman law,\r\nthe Gothic common law, and, more immediately, the Leyes de Toro, a\r\nnational code promulgated by the Cortes of Toro in 1501. By the\r\nconstitution it is stipulated that the same codes shall be in\r\noperation throughout all portions of the realm and that in these codes\r\nshall be maintained but one system of law, to be applied in all\r\nordinary civil and criminal cases in which Spanish subjects shall be\r\ninvolved. The civil code which is at present in operation was put in\r\neffect throughout the entire kingdom May 1, 1889. The penal code dates\r\nfrom 1870, but was amended in 1877. The code of civil procedure was\r\nput in operation April 1, 1881, and that of criminal procedure, June\r\n22, 1882. A new commercial code took effect August 22, 1885.\r\n\r\n\"The power of applying the laws in civil and criminal cases,\" says the\r\nconstitution, \"shall belong exclusively to the courts, which shall\r\nexercise no other functions than those of judging and of enforcing\r\ntheir judgments.\"[865] What courts shall be established, the\r\norganization of each, its powers, the manner of exercising them, and\r\nthe qualifications which its members must possess, are left to be\r\ndetermined by law. The civil hierarchy to-day comprises tribunals of\r\nfour grades: the municipal courts, the courts of first instance, the\r\ncourts of appeal, and the Supreme Court at Madrid. The justices of the\r\npeace of the municipal courts are charged with the registration of\r\nbirths and deaths, the preparation of voting lists, the performance of\r\ncivil marriage, and the hearing of petty cases to the end that\r\nconciliation, if possible, may be effected between the litigants. No\r\ncivil case may be brought in any higher court until effort shall have\r\nbeen made to adjust it in a justice's tribunal. In each of the 495\r\n_partidos judiciales_, or judicial districts, of the kingdom is a\r\ncourt of first instance, empowered to take cognizance of all causes,\r\nboth civil and criminal. From these tribunals lies appeal in civil\r\ncases to fifteen _audiencias territoriales_. By a law of April 20,\r\n1888--the measure by which was introduced the use of the jury in   (p. 627)\r\nthe majority of criminal causes--there were established forty-seven\r\n_audiencias criminales_, one in each province of the kingdom, and\r\nthese have become virtually courts of assize, their sessions being\r\nheld four times a year. Finally, at Madrid is established a Supreme\r\nCourt, modelled on the French Court of Cassation, whose function it is\r\nto decide questions relating to the competence of the inferior\r\ntribunals and to rule on points of law when appeals are carried from\r\nthese tribunals. Cases involving matters of administrative law,\r\ndecided formerly by the provincial councils and the Council of State,\r\nare disposed of now in the _audiencias_ and in the fourth chamber of\r\nthe Supreme Court.[866]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 865: Art. 76. Dodd, Modern Constitutions,\r\n                   II., 213.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 866: G. Marin, La jurisdiction\r\n                   contentieuse administrative en Espagne, in _Revue\r\n                   du Droit Public_, Oct.-Dec., 1906.]\r\n\r\nJustice is administered in the name of the king. All judgments must be\r\npronounced in open court, and by the constitution it is guaranteed\r\nspecifically that proceedings in criminal matters shall be public. In\r\nevery tribunal the state is represented by _abogados fiscales_ (public\r\nprosecutors) and counsel nominated by the crown. Magistrates and\r\njudges, appointed by the crown, may not be removed, suspended, or\r\ntransferred, save under circumstances minutely stipulated in the\r\norganic judicial laws. But judges are responsible personally for any\r\nviolation of law of which they may be guilty.\r\n\r\n*693. Local Government: the Province and the Commune.*--Prior to 1833\r\nthe Spanish mainland comprised thirteen provinces, by which were\r\npreserved in a large measure both the nomenclature and the\r\ngeographical identity of the ancient kingdoms and principalities from\r\nwhich the nation was constructed. In the year mentioned the number of\r\nprovinces was increased to forty-seven, at which figure it remains at\r\nthe present day. The essential agencies of government in the province\r\nare two--the governor and the _diputacion provincial_, or provincial\r\ncouncil. The governor is appointed by the crown and it is his\r\nfunction, under the direction of the Minister of the Interior, to\r\nrepresent the central government in the provincial council and in the\r\ngeneral administrative business of the province. The provincial\r\ncouncil is composed of members chosen by the voters of the province,\r\nwhich means, under the law of June 28, 1890, all male Spaniards of the\r\nage of twenty-five. Under the presidency of the governor the body\r\nmeets yearly, and in the intervals between sessions it is represented\r\nby a _commission provinciale_, or provincial committee, elected\r\nannually. The size of the council varies roughly according to the\r\npopulation of the province.\r\n\r\nThe smallest governmental unit is the commune, and the number of   (p. 628)\r\ncommunes in the kingdom is approximately 8,000. In each is an\r\n_ayuntamiento_, or council, the members of which, varying in number\r\nfrom five to thirty-nine, are elected for four years (one-half\r\nretiring biennially) by those residents of the commune who are\r\nqualified to vote for members of the provincial councils. To serve as\r\nthe chief executive officer of the municipality the _ayuntamiento_\r\nregularly elects from its own number an _alcalde_, or mayor, although\r\nin the larger towns appointment of the mayor is reserved to the crown.\r\n\r\n*694. Principles of Local Control.*--After stipulating that the\r\norganization and powers of the provincial and municipal councils shall\r\nbe regulated by law, the constitution lays down certain fundamental\r\nprinciples to be observed in the enactment of such legislation. These\r\nare (1) the management of the local interests of the province and the\r\ncommune shall be left entirely to the respective councils; (2) the\r\nestimates, accounts, and official acts of these bodies shall\r\ninvariably be made public; (3) the fiscal powers of the councils shall\r\nbe so determined that the financial system of the nation may never be\r\nbrought in jeopardy; and (4) in order to prevent the councils from\r\nexceeding their prerogatives to the prejudice of general and\r\nestablished interests the power of intervention shall be reserved to\r\nthe sovereign and, under certain circumstances, to the Cortes.[867]\r\nThe theory, carried over from the liberal constitution of 1869, is\r\nthat within the spheres marked out for them by law the provinces and\r\nthe municipalities are autonomous. And it undoubtedly is true that,\r\ncompared with the system in operation prior to 1868, the present\r\nrégime represents distinct decentralization. None the less it must be\r\nsaid that in practice there is ever a tendency on the part of the\r\ncentral authorities to encroach upon the privileges of the local\r\ngoverning agencies, and through several years there has been under\r\nconsideration a reorganization of the entire administrative system in\r\nthe direction of less rather than more liberalism. In 1909 a Local\r\nAdministration bill devised by the recent Maura ministry was adopted\r\nby the lower chamber of the Cortes. This measure, which was combatted\r\nwith vigor by the Liberal party, proposed to enlarge the fiscal\r\nautonomy of the communes, but at the same time to modify the\r\nprovincial and municipal electoral system by the establishment of an\r\neducational qualification, by the admission of corporations to\r\nelectoral privileges, and by otherwise lessening the weight of the\r\nvote of the individual citizen. In the Senate the measure met\r\ndetermined opposition, and as yet its fate is uncertain.[868]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 867: Art. 84.

A CENTURY OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n*695. The Napoleonic Subjugation and the Constitution of 1820.*--The\r\ngovernment of Portugal at the opening of the nineteenth century was no\r\nless absolute than was that of Spain, The Cortes was extinct, and\r\nalthough Pombal, chief minister during the period 1750-1777, had\r\ncaused all Portuguese subjects to be made eligible to public office\r\nand had introduced numerous economic and administrative reforms,\r\nnothing had been permitted to be done by which the unrestricted\r\nauthority of the crown might be impaired. The country was affected but\r\nslightly by the Revolution in France. In 1807, however, it fell prey\r\nto Napoleon and the royal family was obliged to take refuge in the\r\ndependency of Brazil. With the aid of the English the power of the\r\nconqueror was broken in 1808, and through a number of years the\r\ngovernment was administered nominally by a commission designated by\r\nthe absentee regent, Dom John, though actually by a British\r\ndictatorship. In 1815 Brazil was raised to the rank of a co-ordinate\r\nkingdom, and from that year until 1822 the official designation of the\r\nstate was \"the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves.\"\r\nIn 1816 the mad queen Maria I. died and the regent succeeded to the\r\naffiliated thrones as John VI. His original intention was to remain in\r\nAmerica, but in 1820 a general revolt in Portugal culminated in the\r\ncalling of a national assembly by which there was framed a\r\nconstitution reproducing the essentials of the Spanish instrument of\r\n1812, and by this turn of events the sovereign was impelled, in 1821,\r\nto set sail for the mother country, leaving as regent in Brazil his\r\nson Dom Pedro. Fidelity to the new constitution was pledged perforce,\r\nbut the elements of reaction gathered strength swiftly, and before the\r\nclose of 1823 the instrument was abrogated. The only tangible result\r\nof the episode was the creation of a constitutional party which\r\nthereafter was able much of the time to keep absolutism upon the\r\ndefensive.[869]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 869: In the meantime a revolt which was\r\n                   impending in Brazil at the time of King John's\r\n                   withdrawal had run its course. September 7, 1822,\r\n                   the regent Dom Pedro, who freely cast in his lot\r\n                   with the revolutionists, proclaimed the country's\r\n                   independence, and some weeks later he was declared\r\n                   constitutional emperor. Protest from Lisbon was\r\n                   emphatic, but means of coercing the rebellious\r\n                   colony were not at hand, and, in 1825, under\r\n                   constraint of the powers, King John was compelled\r\n                   to recognize the independence of his transoceanic\r\n                   dominion.]\r\n\r\n*696. The Constitutional Charter of 1826: Miguelist Wars.*--The    (p. 630)\r\ndeath of John VI., March 10, 1826, precipitated a conflict of large\r\nimportance in the history of Portuguese constitutionalism. The heir to\r\nthe throne was Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, who as sovereign of\r\nPortugal, assumed the title Pedro IV. Having inaugurated his reign by\r\nthe grant of a constitutional charter whereby there was introduced a\r\nparliamentary system of government on the pattern of that in operation\r\nin Great Britain, the new king, being unwilling to withdraw from\r\nAmerica, made over the Portuguese throne to his seven-year-old\r\ndaughter, Dona Maria da Gloria, with the stipulation that when she\r\nshould come of age she should be married to her uncle, Dom Miguel, in\r\nwhom meanwhile the regency was to be vested. Amid enthusiasm the\r\n_Carta Constitucional_ was proclaimed at Lisbon, July 31, 1826, and in\r\nAugust there was established a responsible Liberal ministry under\r\nSaldanha. When, however, in 1828, the regent at length arrived in\r\nPortugal, a clerical and absolutist counter-revolution was found to be\r\nunder way, and by the reactionary elements he was received, not as\r\nregent, but as king. By a Cortes of the ancient type, summoned in the\r\nstead of the parliament provided for in the Charter, Dom Miguel was\r\ntendered the crown, which, in violation of all the pledges he had\r\ngiven, he made haste to accept. That he might vindicate the claims of\r\nhis daughter, the Emperor Pedro, in April, 1831, abdicated his\r\nBrazilian throne and, repairing to Portugal, devoted himself\r\nunsparingly to the task of deposing the usurper. The outcome of the\r\nwars which ensued was that in 1834 Dom Miguel was overthrown and\r\nbanished perpetually from the kingdom. Until his death, in September\r\nof the same year, Pedro acted as regent for his daughter, and under\r\nhis comparatively enlightened rule the Charter of 1826 was restored\r\nand the state was set once more upon the path of reform. Upon his\r\ndeath the Princess Maria assumed the throne as Maria II.[870]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 870: Cambridge Modern History, X., Chap.\r\n                   10; Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Générale, X.,\r\n                   Chap. 6; H.

Bollaert, The Wars of Succession of Portugal and\r\n                   Spain from 1821 to 1840 (London, 1870).]\r\n\r\n*697. Nominal Constitutionalism, 1834-1853.*--The reign of Queen Maria\r\n(1834-1853) was a period of factional turbulence. There were now three\r\npolitical groups of principal importance: the Miguelists, representing\r\nthe interests of the repudiated absolutist régime; the Chartists, who\r\nadvocated the principles of the moderate constitution (that of 1826)\r\nat the time in operation; and the Septembrists,[871] who were      (p. 631)\r\nattached rather to the principles of the radical instrument of\r\n1821-1822. By all, save perhaps the Miguelists, the maintenance of a\r\nconstitution of some type was regarded as no longer an open question.\r\nIn 1836 the Septembrists stimulated a popular rising in consequence of\r\nwhich the constitution of 1822 was declared again in effect until a\r\nnew one should have been devised, and, April 4, 1838, there was\r\nbrought forward under Septembrist auspices an instrument in which it\r\nwas provided that an elected senate should take the place of the\r\naristocratic House of Peers for which the Charter provided, and that\r\nelections to the House of Deputies should thenceforth be direct. In\r\n1839, however, a moderate ministry was constituted with Antonio\r\nBermudo da Costa Cabral as its real, though not its nominal, head, and\r\nby a pronunciamento of February 10, 1842, the Charter was restored to\r\noperation. Costa Cabral (Count of Thomar after 1845) ruled\r\ndespotically until May, 1846, when by a combination of Miguelists,\r\nSeptembrists, and Chartists he was driven into exile.[872] The\r\nChartist ministry of Saldanha succeeded. In 1849 it was replaced by a\r\nministry under the returned Thomar, but by a rising of April 7, 1851,\r\nThomar was again exiled. At the head of a moderate coalition Saldanha\r\ngoverned peacefully through the next five years (1851-1856). The\r\nperiod was marked by two important developments. July 5, 1852, a\r\nso-called \"Additional Act\" revised the Charter by providing for the\r\ndirect election of deputies, the decentralization of the executive,\r\nthe creation of representative municipal councils, and the abolition\r\nof capital punishment for political offenses. A second fact of\r\nimportance was the amalgamation, in 1852, of the Septembrists and the\r\nChartists to form the party of Regeneradores, or Regenerators, in\r\nsupport of the Charter in its new and liberalized form.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 871: So called from the _coup d'état_ of\r\n                   September, 1836, mentioned shortly.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 872: E.

Party Rivalries: the Rotativos.*--In the constitutional history of\r\nthe kingdom the reign of Pedro V. (1853-1861) possesses slight\r\nimportance. There was less civil strife than during the preceding\r\ngeneration, but ministries took office in rapid succession and little\r\nimprovement was realized in practical political conditions. The period\r\ncovered by the more extended reign of Luiz I. (1861-1889) was of the\r\nsame character, save that its later years were given some distinction\r\nby certain developments in the party situation. The death of the old\r\nChartist leader Saldanha in 1876 was followed, indeed, by the\r\nappearance of a political alignment that was essentially new. Already\r\nthe Regeneradores, representing the Chartist-Septembrist coalition (p. 632)\r\nof 1852, had disintegrated, and in 1877 the more radical elements of\r\nthe defunct party, known at first as the Historic Left, were\r\nreorganized under the name of the Progressistas, or Progressives. The\r\nnew conservative elements, on the other hand, carried on the\r\ntraditions and preserved the name of the original Regeneradores. In\r\nthe Cortes the Progressistas assumed the position of a Constitutional\r\nLeft and the surviving Regeneradores that of a Conservative Right.\r\nBoth were monarchical and both were attached to the existing\r\nconstitution, differing only in respect to the amendments which they\r\nwould have preferred to introduce in that instrument. Of remaining\r\nparties two were of importance, i.e., the Miguelists, representing\r\nstill the interests of absolutism, and the Republicans, who first\r\nacquired definite party organization in 1881.\r\n\r\nBetween 1877 and 1910 the Regeneradores and the Progressistas shared\r\nin rotation the spoils of office with such regularity that the two\r\nacquired popularly the nickname of the _rotativos_. Both were\r\ndominated by professional politicians whose skill in manipulating\r\npopular elections was equalled only by their greed for the spoils of\r\nvictory. Successful operation of a parliamentary system presupposes at\r\nleast a fairly healthy public opinion. But in Portugal, upwards of\r\nfour-fifths of whose inhabitants are illiterate,[873] there has been\r\nno such favoring condition, and the opportunity for the demagogue and\r\nthe cacique has been correspondingly tempting. Parties have been\r\nregularly mere cliques and party politics only factional strife.\r\nThroughout the period corruption was abundant and such public feeling\r\nas existed was stifled systematically. Elections were supervised in\r\nevery detail by the provincial governors; agents of the Government\r\nwere employed to instruct the people in their choice of\r\nrepresentatives; and the voters did habitually precisely what they\r\nwere told to do. No one ever expected an election to show results\r\nadverse to the Government. Especially unscrupulous was the manner in\r\nwhich the preponderating parties obstructed systematically the\r\nelection of Republican and Independent deputies. As late as 1906 but\r\none Republican was returned to the Cortes, although it was a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that in many constituencies the party commanded a\r\nclear majority.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 873: By official calculation, 78.6 per\r\n                   cent in 1900.]\r\n\r\n*699. The Dictatorship of Franco, 1906-1908.*--From June, 1900, to\r\nOctober, 1904, the Regeneradores were in power, with Ribeiro as\r\npremier. During this period two national elections, in 1900 and in\r\n1904, yielded the controlling party substantial majorities. From\r\nOctober, 1904, the Progressive ministry of Luciano de Castro occupied\r\nthe field, but in the spring of 1906 there took place a series of\r\nministerial crises in the course of which Ribeiro returned for a   (p. 633)\r\nbrief interval to power. The election of April 26, 1906, gave the\r\nRegeneradores 113 seats, the Progressistas 30, and the Republicans 1.\r\nThe ministerial changes by which this election was accompanied\r\nprepared the way for the establishment of the régime known in recent\r\nPortuguese history as the _dictadura_, or dictatorship. The new\r\npremier, João Franco, was one of the abler and more conscientious men\r\nin public life. Originally a Regenerator, as early as 1901 he had led\r\na secession from the party, and in 1903 he had organized definitely a\r\nthird party, the Liberal Regenerators, whose avowed end was the\r\nestablishment in Portugal of true parliamentarism. In 1906 a \"Liberal\r\nConcentration\" was effected between Franco's followers and the\r\nProgressistas, led by Castro, and the outcome was the calling, May 19,\r\n1906, of Franco to the premiership. That office he assumed with the\r\ndetermination to introduce and to carry through an elaborate programme\r\nof sorely needed fiscal and administrative reforms. If possible, his\r\nmethods were to be entirely constitutional; if not, as nearly so as\r\nmight prove practicable. The Cortes elected April 26 met June 6 and,\r\nbeing found unpromising, was dissolved. During the campaign which\r\nfollowed the Regenerador party, to which Franco nominally belonged,\r\nsplit, the Franquistas, or supporters of the premier, taking the name\r\nof New Regenerators. The returns yielded by the election of August 12\r\nwere: New Regenerators, 73 seats; Progressives, 43; Old Regenerators,\r\n23; Republicans, 4; with scattering seats distributed among other\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nThe sitting of the Cortes which began September 29, 1906, was one of\r\nthe stormiest on record. In May, 1907, when the Government seemed on\r\nthe point of collapse and it was supposed that Franco would resign,\r\nthe indomitable premier effected a _coup d'état_ whereby the ministry\r\nwas reconstituted, the Cortes was dissolved, and several important\r\nbills which were pending were proclaimed to have acquired the force of\r\nlaw. During the ensuing twelvemonth the government was that of a\r\nbenevolent but uncompromising dictatorship. Supported by the king, the\r\narmy, and a considerable body of partisans, Franco succeeded in\r\ncarrying through the major portion of his reform programme. But he was\r\nopposed by the Republicans, by the professional politicians of the\r\nolder parties, and by the entire hierarchy of administrative and\r\njudicial officials who shrank from impending investigation. His task\r\nwas enhanced tremendously by the growing unpopularity of King Carlos,\r\nand in defense of the sovereign it was found necessary to deprive the\r\nHouse of Peers of its judicial functions, to replace the district and\r\nmunicipal councils by commissions named by the crown, and, in short,\r\nto suspend virtually all remaining vestiges of popular government, (p. 634)\r\nas well as the various guarantees of individual liberty.\r\n\r\n*700. Restoration of Normal Conditions.*--February 1, 1908, when the\r\nsituation bordered on revolution, King Carlos and the crown prince\r\nLouis Philippe were assassinated and the dictatorship of Franco was\r\nbrought abruptly to an end. The king's second son, who succeeded under\r\nthe title of Manoel II., called together an extraordinary junta of\r\nministers and party leaders, at whose instigation the imperious\r\npremier resigned and withdrew from the country; whereupon, under the\r\npremiership of Admiral Ferreira do Amaral, there was formed a\r\ncoalition ministry, representative of all of the monarchist parties.\r\nThe administrative commissions created by Franco were dissolved; the\r\ncivil list, concerning which there had been grave controversy, was\r\nreduced; the House of Peers was reconstituted; the election of a new\r\nCortes was ordered; and parliamentary institutions, suspended for a\r\nyear, were revived. The various reforms, on the other hand, for which\r\nthe dictator had been responsible were brought likewise to an end. The\r\nelection of April 5, attended by grave disorders, yielded the\r\nGovernment a decisive majority and, April 29, the new sovereign\r\nformally opened the first Cortes of his reign and took oath to support\r\nthe constitution. In the Chamber the old balance between the\r\nRegeneradores and the Progressistas reappeared. Of the former there\r\nwere 61; of the latter, 59. The Republicans had 7 seats; a group of\r\n\"Nationalists,\" 3; the Independents, 1; and the \"Amaralists,\" detached\r\nsupporters of the ministry, 17. Before the end of the year the\r\nGovernment lost its majority, and December 24 a new coalition cabinet\r\nwas made up by Campos Henriques, a former minister of justice.[874]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 874: On the political history of Portugal\r\n                   since the establishment of constitutionalism see\r\n                   Cambridge Modern History, XI., Chap. 20, XII.,\r\n                   Chap. 10; and Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire\r\n                   Générale, XI., Chap. 9, XII., Chap, 9.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM\r\n\r\n*701. The Constitution.*--Before speaking of the revolution of 1910, in\r\nconsequence of which the monarchy was overthrown and the present\r\nrepublic was established, it is desirable that brief allusion be made\r\nto the governmental system of the earlier régime. The fundamental law\r\nin operation in 1910 was the _Carta Constitucional_ of 1826,       (p. 635)\r\nremodelled and liberalized by numerous amendments. The revision\r\naccomplished by the Additional Act of 1852 has been mentioned. An\r\namendment of July 24, 1885, provided for the gradual extinction of the\r\nright of hereditary peers to sit in the upper house and for the\r\nrepresentation, in the Deputies, of minorities; while three amendments\r\nof importance during the reign of Carlos I. (1889-1908) were: (1) that\r\nof March 28, 1895, whereby the number of deputies was reduced from 180\r\nto 120 and the qualifications requisite for the exercise of the\r\nsuffrage were overhauled; (2) that of September 25 of the same year\r\nwhereby the elective portion of the House of Peers was abolished; and\r\n(3) that of August 8, 1901, by which the conditions of election to the\r\nHouse of Deputies were revised. In its final form the constitution was\r\nan instrument of unusual length, comprising eight \"titles\" and 145\r\narticles, some of which were very comprehensive.[875]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 875: The text of the constitution was\r\n                   published by the state under the title of Carta\r\n                   Constitucional da Monarchia Portugueza ... e\r\n                   Diplomas Correlativos (Lisbon, 1890).

The Crown and the Ministry.*--Provision was made for the exercise\r\nof four distinct categories of powers, i.e., executive, moderative,\r\nlegislative, and judicial. Of these the first two were lodged in the\r\nsovereign, the third in the sovereign and Cortes conjointly, and the\r\nfourth in tribunals established under provision of the constitution.\r\nThe crown was vested permanently in the descendants of Dona Maria II.,\r\nof the House of Braganza, and, in default thereof, in the nearest\r\ncollateral line. The succession was regulated on the principle of\r\nprimogeniture, with preference to the male line, and during a\r\nsovereign's minority the regency devolved upon the nearest relative,\r\naccording to the order of succession, who had attained the age of\r\ntwenty-five. Associated with the sovereign was a ministry and a\r\ncouncil of state. The ministry consisted of a premier, usually without\r\nportfolio, and a variable number of heads of departments (in 1910,\r\nseven),[876] and it was a principle of the constitution that, the\r\ncrown being legally irresponsible, no executive act might be adjudged\r\nvalid unless signed by one or more of the members of the ministerial\r\ngroup. For all of their acts the ministers were responsible nominally\r\nto the Cortes, although in point of fact the turbulent state of    (p. 636)\r\npolitics rendered such responsibility nearly impossible to enforce.\r\nThe council of state was a body composed of the crown prince (when of\r\nthe age of eighteen) and of twelve men appointed by the king for life,\r\nusually from present or past ministers. It was required that the\r\ncouncil be consulted in all affairs of weight and in general measures\r\nof public administration, especially those relating to the declaration\r\nof war, the conclusion of peace, and the conduct of diplomatic\r\nnegotiations.[877]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 876: Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance,\r\n                   Justice and Worship, War, Marine and Colonies, and\r\n                   Public Works.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 877: Arts. 107-112. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 168-169.]\r\n\r\nAside from participation in legislation, the powers of the crown\r\n(exercised at least nominally through the intermediary of the\r\nministers and councillors) were, as has been said, of two categories,\r\nexecutive and moderative. The powers of an executive character were of\r\nthe usual sort, i.e., the appointment of civil, military, and\r\necclesiastical officials; the conduct of foreign relations; the\r\npromulgation of the laws, and of decrees, instructions, and\r\nregulations requisite to the proper execution of the laws; the\r\nordering, not less frequently than quadrennially, of an election of a\r\nnew Cortes; and the supervision, in conformity with the constitution,\r\nof \"all things which bear upon the internal and external security of\r\nthe state.\"[878] Among modern constitutions those of Portugal and\r\nBrazil are unique in the distinction drawn between powers that are\r\nexecutive and powers that are \"moderative.\" Under the head of\r\nmoderative powers the Portuguese constitution vested in the crown the\r\nnomination of peers, the convening of the Cortes in extraordinary\r\nsession, approval of the measures of the Cortes to the end that they\r\nmight acquire the force of law, the proroguing and adjourning of the\r\nCortes and the dissolving of the House of Deputies, the appointing and\r\ndismissing of ministers, the granting of amnesties, and the remitting\r\nor reducing of penalties imposed upon offenders by judicial sentence.\r\nThe theory was that these were powers which the sovereign exercised in\r\nthe capacity of mediator between the several organs of the\r\ngovernmental system, and by the constitution it was declared that this\r\nmoderative power was the keystone of the entire political\r\norganization. The distinction, however, while from a certain point of\r\nview logical enough, does not appear to have possessed much practical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 878: Arts. 75-77. Ibid., II., 162-164.]\r\n\r\n*703. The Cortes.*--Powers of a legislative character were vested in the\r\nsovereign conjointly with a parliament of two chambers, the _Camara\r\ndos Pares_, or House of Peers, and the _Camara dos Deputados_, or\r\nHouse of Deputies. Collectively, the two houses were known as the\r\n_Cortes Feraes_, or, more briefly, the Cortes. Until 1885 the House of\r\nPeers consisted of members of two classes, those who sat by        (p. 637)\r\nhereditary right and those who were nominated by the crown for life.\r\nBy the constitutional amendment of July 24, 1885, hereditary peerages\r\nwere put in the way of gradual abolition and it was stipulated that\r\nwhen they should have been extinguished the chamber should be composed\r\nof princes of the royal blood, the archbishops and bishops of Portugal\r\nproper, 100 members appointed by the king for life, and 50 members\r\nelected every new parliament by the lower chamber. By amendment of\r\nSeptember 25, 1895, however, the 50 elective peerages were abolished\r\nand the number of royal appointees was reduced to 90. In 1910,\r\ntherefore, the chamber was made up of (1) princes of the royal blood\r\nwho had attained the age of twenty-five; (2) surviving peers whose\r\nhereditary right antedated 1885, together with their immediate\r\nsuccessors; (3) the Patriarch of Lisbon and the archbishops and\r\nbishops of the continental territory of the kingdom; and (4) the 90\r\nlife peers nominated by the crown. In the nomination of peers the\r\ncrown was restricted only by the requirement that members must have\r\nattained the age of forty and must be able to meet a considerable\r\nproperty qualification.\r\n\r\nThe House of Deputies, as regulated by the law of August 8, 1901, was\r\ncomposed of 155 members, of whom 148 represented the 26 electoral\r\ncircles of Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira,[879] and 7 represented\r\nthe colonies. By amendment of 1885 provision was made for the\r\nrepresentation of minorities, and of the 155 members in 1910, 35 sat\r\nas minority representatives. This result was attained through an\r\narrangement whereby in circles which elected more than one deputy each\r\nelector voted for one or two fewer than the number of seats to be\r\nfilled. Deputies were chosen by direct election, and in the choice all\r\nmale citizens twenty-one years of age were entitled to participate,\r\nprovided they paid taxes aggregating 500 _reis_ (about 56 cents)\r\nannually or were able to read and write. Convicts, beggars, bankrupts,\r\ndomestic servants, workingmen permanently employed by the state, and\r\nsoldiers and sailors below the rank of commissioned officer were\r\ndisqualified. In point of fact, the prevalence of poverty and of\r\nilliteracy operated to confine the franchise within very narrow\r\nlimits. Peers, naturalized aliens, persons not qualified to vote, and\r\ncertain employees of the state were ineligible for election, and\r\ndeputies were required to possess an income of not less than 400\r\nmilreis ($425) annually, or to be graduates of a professional,\r\nsecondary, or higher school. After 1892 no deputies, save those\r\nrepresenting the colonies, were paid salaries.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 879: The Azores and Madeira are regarded\r\n                   as integral parts of the nation.]\r\n\r\nSessions of the Cortes were required to be opened by the crown on  (p. 638)\r\nthe second day of January of each year. According to the amendment of\r\nJuly 24, 1885, a regular session lasted three months and each Cortes,\r\nunless sooner dissolved, lasted three years. The president and\r\nvice-president of the House of Peers were appointed by the crown;\r\nlikewise the corresponding officials of the House of Deputies, from a\r\nlist of five nominees presented by that body. Each chamber was\r\nauthorized to choose its own secretaries, to pass upon the qualifications\r\nof its members, and to frame its rules of procedure. Except at times\r\nwhen the welfare of the state demanded secrecy, sessions were required\r\nto be public. To the lower chamber was committed the initiative in all\r\nmatters pertaining to taxation, the recruiting of troops, the\r\ninvestigation of the administrative offices, and the consideration of\r\npropositions submitted by the executive. Upon it, likewise, was\r\nconferred exclusive power to impeach ministers and councillors of\r\nstate. The right to initiate measures in general was vested in each of\r\nthe two houses, as well as in the Government. Ministers were\r\nprivileged to attend legislative sessions and to participate in\r\ndebate. It was required that the sovereign should give or refuse his\r\napproval of every measure within a month after it should have been\r\npresented to him.[880]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 880: Arts. 45-62. Dodd, Modern\r\n                   Constitutions, II., 156-159.]\r\n\r\n*704. The Judiciary and Local Government.*--The judicial hierarchy\r\nconsisted of 193 courts of first instance, one in each of an equal\r\nnumber of _comarcas_, or districts; three courts of appeal, sitting at\r\nLisbon, Oporto, and Ponta Delgada (in the Azores); and a Supreme Court\r\nat Lisbon. Judges were appointed by the crown, and were irremovable\r\nsave in consequence of judicial sentence. In the trial of criminal\r\ncases the English jury system was in vogue, although it operated but\r\nindifferently. The functions of the Supreme Court were those of\r\nhearing appeals from the inferior tribunals, trying cases involving\r\njudges of the appellate courts and members of the diplomatic corps,\r\nand deciding conflicts of jurisdiction.[881]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 881: Arts. 118-131. Ibid., II., 169-171.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century continental Portugal was divided for\r\nadministrative purposes into six provinces, delimited in a large\r\nmeasure in accordance with the physical configuration of the country.\r\nIn 1836 the province ceased to be an administrative unit and, after a\r\nperiod of readjustment, there was established by law of March 18,\r\n1842, an administrative hierarchy which in its more important aspects\r\nhas survived to the present day. Under that measure the realm was\r\ndivided into 21 districts (17 continental and 4 insular), 292\r\n_concelhos_, or communes (263 continental and 29 insular), and 3,690\r\n_freguezias_, or parishes (3,788 continental and 172 insular).     (p. 639)\r\nUntil 1910 the government of the district was vested in a commission\r\nconsisting of two members appointed by the central authorities and\r\nthree elected triennially by delegates from the communal councils. Of\r\nthe two centrally appointed members, one, the governor, presided over\r\nthe commission; the other was an administrative auditor. Among the\r\nfunctions of the commission was that of sitting as an administrative\r\ncourt. The commune was governed by a mayor, appointed by the central\r\nauthorities on nomination of the governor of the district, and a\r\ncouncil of five to fifteen members elected on a single ticket by the\r\ncommunal voters. The council was presided over, not by the mayor, but\r\nby one of its own members. The governing agencies of the parish were\r\nan elected council (_junta de parochia_), presided over by the parish\r\npriest, and the _regidor_, named by the district governor to represent\r\nthe interests of the central government. Throughout the entire system\r\nthe preponderating fact was the thoroughgoing centralization which,\r\nthrough the governors, mayors, and _regadores_, the authorities at\r\nLisbon were able to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE REVOLUTION OF 1910\r\n\r\n*705. Political Unsettlement, 1908-1910.*--The period of two and a half\r\nyears which elapsed between the accession of Manoel II., in February,\r\n1908, and his deposition, in October, 1910, was one of continued\r\npolitical stress. The sovereign was youthful, inexperienced, and\r\nlacking in political training. His advisers were divided in their\r\ncounsels and impelled largely by selfish motives, and in the teeth of\r\nrapidly spreading republican and socialist propaganda the old dynastic\r\nparties kept up unremittingly their unseemly recriminations. In\r\nFebruary, 1909, the king called into consultation the leaders of the\r\nvarious monarchist groups and sought to impress upon them the\r\nnecessity of co-operation, and when the Cortes was convened, March 1,\r\nthe Speech from the Throne announced optimistically a programme of\r\nconstructive legislation, embracing, among other things, the enactment\r\nof more liberal press laws, a reform of primary education, and a\r\nreadjustment of taxation. Within the Cortes, however, it was found\r\nimpossible to carry any one of the measures proposed and, March 29,\r\nthe Henriquez ministry, after only three months in office, resigned.\r\nDuring the remainder of the year three successive ministries were set\r\nup: that of General Sebastiano Telles, which lasted only from April 11\r\nuntil May 4; that of Wencelao de Lima, extending from May 4 to\r\nDecember 21; and that of Beirao, which continued from December 21 to\r\nearly June of the following year. The De Lima cabinet was formed from\r\nelements which stood largely outside the swirl of party politics,  (p. 640)\r\nbut the Republican and Regenerador opposition was so intense that\r\nnothing could be accomplished by it. The Beirao government by which it\r\nwas succeeded was composed entirely of Progressives. The Speech from\r\nthe Throne at the convening of the Cortes, January 2, 1910, ignored\r\ncompletely the grim realities of the political situation. Ostensibly\r\nto afford the Beirao ministry an opportunity to formulate a programme,\r\nthe session was adjourned until March 3, at which time the members\r\nreassembled, only to be sent back again to their homes until June 1.\r\nAt the second reassembling the ministry was opposed with such\r\nvirulence that it at once retired and, after some delay, the\r\nRegeneradors came into power under Teixeira de Sousa. The Cortes was\r\ndissolved and a national election, accompanied by grave disorders, was\r\nheld, August 28. At the election the Regeneradors obtained 80 seats,\r\nthe Progressives 43, the Republicans 14 (twice as many as they had\r\never obtained before), and the Independents 2.[882] The new Cortes\r\nassembled September 23; but two days later it was adjourned until\r\nDecember 12, and, in point of fact, it never sat again.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 882: Ten of the fourteen Republican\r\n                   deputies were elected in Lisbon. The popular vote\r\n                   in that city was: Republicans, 15,104; Monarchists\r\n                   of all parties, 9,108. In 1908 the numbers were\r\n                   13,074 and 10,982 respectively.]\r\n\r\n*706. Overthrow of the Monarchy.*--During many months a plot had been\r\nripening in Republican circles looking toward the deposition of the\r\nking, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the proclamation of a\r\nrepublic. By reason of the confusion and repression which prevailed\r\nperennially in Portuguese politics, the actual strength, numerically\r\nand otherwise, of republicanism in the kingdom in 1910 cannot be\r\nknown. But it is sufficiently clear that the propaganda of the past\r\nthirty years had borne much fruit and that among the artisan, trader,\r\nand small burgher classes, and especially in the ranks of the army and\r\nthe navy, the enemies of the monarchy had come to be numerous and\r\ninfluential. The leaders of the republican movement represented, on\r\nthe whole, the best educated and most progressive elements of the\r\ncountry--largely lawyers, physicians, journalists and other men of the\r\nprofessions and of business. In the later summer of 1910 various\r\nintimations of a far-reaching revolutionary plot were received by the\r\nGovernment and the date (September 14) which was at one time fixed for\r\nthe insurrection proved an impracticable one because the authorities\r\nbecame aware of the project and subverted the republican plans by\r\nordering the warships on that day to quit the Tagus. Within official\r\ncircles it was generally assumed that the revolutionists, balked once,\r\nwould return to the project. The crash came, however, at a moment  (p. 641)\r\nwhen the Government was entirely off its guard, and its effects were\r\nunexpectedly summary. The immediate incident by which it was\r\nprecipitated was the assassination in Lisbon, October 3, of a\r\ndistinguished Republican member of the Cortes, Dr. Miguel Bombarda.\r\nWhether justly or not, the assassination was interpreted by the\r\npopulace as a political crime, and to the disaffected elements of the\r\narmy and navy the occasion seemed ripe for the execution of the\r\ncontemplated _coup_. October 4 open revolt broke out among the\r\nnational troops, and during the ensuing forty-eight hours a handful of\r\nsoldiers and sailors, aided by armed civilians, acquired the mastery\r\nof the capital, put the king to flight, won over the country to their\r\ncause, and proclaimed the establishment of a republican form of\r\ngovernment. The revolutionists were organized, the royalists were not,\r\nand the defeat of the latter was complete. It was also substantially\r\nbloodless. King Manoel, and the queen-mother Amelia, contriving an\r\nescape from the royal palace, made their way to Eraceira, and thence\r\nto Gibraltar. Subsequently they were conveyed to England.\r\n\r\n*707. Measures of the Provisional Government.*--Meanwhile, October 5,\r\nthere was established at Lisbon a provisional government composed of\r\nnine ministers and presided over by the scholar and litterateur,\r\nTheophile Braga. The members of this government were drawn principally\r\nfrom the group of Republican deputies representing the Lisbon\r\nconstituencies. A few had held high office under the monarchy, but\r\nmost of them, including Braga, were men of little or no experience in\r\nadministrative work. The flight of the king and the collapse of the\r\nmonarchist cause cleared the way for a speedy establishment of the new\r\norder, and without awaiting a formal remodelling of the constitution,\r\nthe Braga government proceeded to carry into execution a number of\r\nfeatures of the Republican programme. October 7 it promised amnesty to\r\npolitical and press exiles, the revocation of various illiberal press\r\nand judicial laws, the suppression of summary magisterial powers, and\r\na long list of other administrative and judicial reforms. October 18\r\nit abolished the monarchy and proscribed forever the royal house of\r\nBraganza. On the same day it abolished likewise the Council of State\r\nand the House of Peers, together with all hereditary titles and\r\nprivileges. In the course of further measures of reform relating to\r\npublic finance, agriculture, education, religion, and social welfare,\r\nit issued a new electoral law and effected arrangements for the\r\nconvening of a national assembly to which should be committed the task\r\nof framing a republican constitution. The electoral decree of March\r\n15, 1911, conferred the franchise upon all Portuguese citizens of the\r\nage of twenty-one who under the monarchy were entitled to its\r\nexercise, and upon all, in addition, who were able to read and     (p. 642)\r\nwrite, barring soldiers, bankrupts, and ex-convicts. The two cities,\r\nLisbon, and Oporto, were created electoral districts in each of which\r\neight members were to be chosen by _scrutin de liste_ after the\r\nBelgian, or d'Hondt, plan of proportional representation, and the\r\nremainder of the country (including the colonies) was divided into\r\ndistricts in each of which four members were to be chosen, also with\r\nprovision for the representation of minorities.\r\n\r\n*708. The Constitution Framed and the Government Organized.*--The\r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly took place May 28, 1911. There\r\nwere no monarchist candidates and, there having been neither time nor\r\noccasion for the appearance of serious differences among the\r\nRepublicans, the event was attended by little excitement and by no\r\ndisorder. In many districts the candidates approved by the Provisional\r\nGovernment were unopposed. The Assembly was convened June 19. By\r\nunanimous vote of its 192 members the decree by which the monarchy had\r\nbeen abolished and the Braganza dynasty banished was enacted into law,\r\nwhereupon the body addressed itself to the framing of a budget and the\r\nadoption of organic laws relating to the nature and manner of exercise\r\nof the political powers of the republic. A draft of the constitution,\r\nframed by the Republican leaders, was read to the delegates July 3,\r\nand August 18 it was voted, amid general acclamations, almost without\r\nmodification. The presidential election was fixed for August 23. Of\r\nthe two principal candidates, Dr. Manoel Arriaga represented the more\r\nmoderate wing of the Republican element, Dr. Machado Santos (the\r\nprovisional president) the more radical. Dr. Arriaga was elected by a\r\nvote of 121 to 86. August 24 the Assembly terminated its proceedings\r\nand the new constitution was put in operation. The first cabinet,\r\npresided over by João Chagas, was announced at the beginning of\r\nSeptember. It was at this point that France, Spain, and a number of\r\nother European powers for the first time recognized officially the\r\nrepublic's existence. The difficulties encountered by the new\r\nrégime--royalist invasions, outbreaks of disaffection, strikes, lack\r\nof funds--were numerous. Not the least serious was the inevitable rise\r\nof differences among the Republicans themselves. During the autumn of\r\n1911 the Moderates split into two rival groups, and the more important\r\nof them, led by Dr. Almeida, definitely withdrew its support from the\r\nGovernment. The result was a ministerial crisis, and November 7 the\r\nChagas cabinet resigned. The new \"ministry of concentration\" formed by\r\nthe radical Vasconcellos was composed of eight members divided almost\r\nequally between the Moderates and the Democrats. In more recent days\r\nthe lines of party cleavage have tended to be accentuated and the  (p. 643)\r\nstability, if not the existence, of the republic to be increasingly\r\nmenaced. In June, 1912, a new ministry was constituted under Leite, in\r\nwhich all of the groups in the lower chamber were represented. There\r\nis reason to apprehend that, in the event of the survival of the\r\nrepublic, the outcome will be at best but the resuscitation, under\r\nother names and forms, of the long-endured rotativist régime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE CONSTITUTION OF 1911\r\n\r\n*709. Constitutional Guarantees: Amendment.*--Aside from five articles\r\nof a temporary nature, the constitution of 1911 is arranged in\r\neighty-two articles, grouped in seven \"titles\" or divisions. The two\r\ndivisions of principal length are those which relate to the rights and\r\nliberties of the individual and the organs and exercise of sovereign\r\npower. The guarantees extended the individual comprise a bill of\r\nrights hardly paralleled in comprehensiveness among the constitutions\r\nof European nations. To Portuguese citizens and to aliens resident in\r\nthe country are pledged full liberty of conscience, freedom of speech,\r\nfreedom of the press, liberty of association, inviolability of\r\ndomicile and of property, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,\r\nprivacy of correspondence, and freedom of employment and of trade save\r\nonly when restriction is required for the public good. Law is declared\r\nto be uniform for all and no public privilege may be enjoyed by reason\r\nof birth or title. No one may be required to pay a tax which has not\r\nbeen levied by the legislative chambers or by an administrative\r\nauthority specifically qualified by law, and, save in case of\r\nenumerated offenses of serious import, no one may be imprisoned except\r\nupon accusation according to the forms of law. No one may be compelled\r\nto perform an act, or to refrain from the performance of an act,\r\nexcept by warrant of law.\r\n\r\nThe constitution is subject to amendment under regulations of a\r\nsomewhat curious character. Revision of the fundamental law may be\r\nundertaken normally by Congress at the end of every decennial period,\r\nthe Congress whose mandate coincides with the period of revision being\r\nendowed automatically with constituent powers and the process of\r\nrevision differing in no respect from that of ordinary legislation. At\r\nthe end of a five-year period from the date of promulgation, however,\r\namendment may be undertaken, providing two-thirds of the members of\r\nthe chambers sitting jointly vote favorably. Under all circumstances\r\namendments must be specific rather than general, and in no case may an\r\namendment be received or debated which has for its object the\r\nabolition of the republican form of government.\r\n\r\n*710. The President and the Ministry.*--Sovereignty is lodged in   (p. 644)\r\nthe nation, and the organs of the sovereign will are the independent\r\nbut supposedly harmonious executive, legislative, and judicial\r\nauthorities. The powers of the executive are exercised by the\r\nPresident and the ministers. The President is chosen by the two houses\r\nof Congress assembled in joint session sixty days prior to the\r\nexpiration of the presidential term. Voting is by secret ballot and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority is required for election, although in default of\r\nsuch a majority choice is made on the third ballot by simple plurality\r\nbetween the two candidates receiving the largest number of votes. If\r\nthe office falls vacant unexpectedly the chambers choose in the same\r\nmanner a president to complete the unexpired term. The term is four\r\nyears, and after retiring from office an ex-president may not be\r\nre-elected for a full term prior to the lapse of four more years. Only\r\nnative Portuguese citizens at least thirty-five years of age are\r\neligible. Without the permission of Congress the President may not\r\nabsent himself from the national territory, and he may be removed from\r\noffice by the vote of two-thirds of the members of the chambers\r\nsitting jointly. The duties of the President are, among other things,\r\nto negotiate treaties and to represent the nation in its external\r\nrelations generally, to appoint and dismiss the ministers and public\r\nofficials, to summon the Congress in extraordinary session, to\r\npromulgate the laws of Congress, together with the instructions and\r\nregulations necessary for their enforcement, and to remit and commute\r\npenalties. If two-thirds of the members of the chambers so request,\r\nprojected treaties of alliance must be laid before Congress, and the\r\nappointment and suspension of public officials may be effected only on\r\nproposal of the ministers. Every act of the President must be\r\ncountersigned by at least one minister, and every minister is\r\nresponsible politically and legally for all acts which he countersigns\r\nor executes. One member of the ministerial group, designated by the\r\nPresident, exercises the functions of premier. Ministers may be\r\nmembers of Congress, and in any case they are privileged to appear in\r\nthe chambers to defend their acts. Among offenses for which ministers\r\nmay be held to account in the ordinary tribunals the constitution\r\nspecifies all acts which tend to subvert the independence of the\r\nnation, the inviolability of the constitution and of the republican\r\nform of government, the political and legal rights of the individual,\r\nthe internal peace of the country, or the probity of administrative\r\nprocedure. The penalty imposed for guilt in respect to any of these\r\noffenses is removal from office and disqualification to hold office\r\nthereafter.[883]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 883: Provisions relating to the executive\r\n                   are contained in Arts. 36-55.]\r\n\r\n*711. Congress.*--The exercise of legislative power is vested      (p. 645)\r\nexclusively in Congress. There are two houses, the Council of\r\nMunicipalities, or senate, and the National Council, or chamber of\r\ndeputies. The members of both are chosen by direct vote of the people.\r\nSenators are elected for six years, one-half of the body retiring\r\ntriennially. Each district returns three members, but to assure the\r\nrepresentation of minorities electors are permitted to vote for but\r\ntwo. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are chosen for three years.\r\nSenators must be at least thirty-five years of age and deputies\r\ntwenty-five. Congress is required to meet in regular session each year\r\non the second day of December. The period of a session is four months,\r\nand a prorogation or an adjournment may be ordered only by the\r\nchambers themselves. Extraordinary sessions may be convoked by\r\none-fourth of the members or by the President. Each chamber is\r\nauthorized to judge the qualifications of its members, to choose its\r\npresident and other officers, and to fix its rules of procedure. The\r\npresiding official at joint sessions is the elder of the two\r\npresidents. Members are accorded the usual privileges of speech and\r\nimmunities from judicial process, and they are guaranteed compensation\r\nat rates to be regulated by law.\r\n\r\nThe functions and powers of the chambers are enumerated in much\r\ndetail. Most important among them is the enactment, interpretation,\r\nsuspension, and abrogation of all laws of the republic. Still more\r\ncomprehensive is the power to supervise the operation of the\r\nconstitution and of the laws and \"to promote the general welfare of\r\nthe nation.\" More specifically, the chambers are authorized to levy\r\ntaxes, vote expenditures, contract loans, provide for the national\r\ndefense, create public offices, fix salaries, regulate tariffs, coin\r\nmoney, establish standards of weights and measures, emit bills of\r\ncredit, organize the judiciary, control the administration of national\r\nproperty, approve regulations devised for the enforcement of the laws,\r\nand elect the President of the republic. To the Chamber of Deputies is\r\naccorded the right to initiate all measures relating to taxes, the\r\norganization of the forces on land and on sea, the revision of the\r\nconstitution, the prorogation or adjournment of legislative sessions,\r\nthe discussion of proposals made by the President, and the bringing of\r\nactions against members of the executive department. Initiative in\r\nrespect to all other matters may be taken by any member of either\r\nbranch of Congress or by the President of the republic. A measure\r\nwhich is adopted by a majority vote in each of the two houses is\r\ntransmitted to the President to be promulgated as law. The President\r\npossesses not a shred of veto power. He is required to promulgate\r\nwithin fifteen days any measure duly enacted; if he fails to do so,\r\nthe measure takes effect none the less. When the chambers fall into\r\ndisagreement regarding proposed changes in a bill, or when one     (p. 646)\r\nchamber rejects a bill outright, the subject is debated and a decision\r\nis reached in joint session.\r\n\r\n*712. The Judiciary and Local Government.*--The organs of judicial\r\nadministration comprise courts of first instance, courts of appeal,\r\nand a supreme tribunal sitting at the capital. Judges are appointed\r\nfor life, but may be removed from office in accordance with procedure\r\nto be established by law. The employment of the jury is optional with\r\nthe parties in civil cases but obligatory in all criminal cases of\r\nserious import. With respect to local government the constitution goes\r\nno further than to lay down certain general principles and to enjoin\r\nthat the actual working arrangements be regulated by subsequent\r\nlegislation. Among the principles enumerated are the immunity of the\r\nlocal authorities from intervention on the part of the central\r\nexecutive power, the revision of the acts of the public officials in\r\nadministrative tribunals, the fiscal independence of the local\r\ngovernmental units, and, finally, the employment for local purposes of\r\nboth proportional representation and the referendum.[884]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 884: A French translation of the\r\n                   Portuguese constitution of 1911 will be found in\r\n                   _Revue du Droit Public_, Oct.-Dec, 1911. Various\r\n                   aspects of the revolution of 1910 and of subsequent\r\n                   developments are discussed in E. J.

Avoiding abstract\r\n    principles and _a priori_ speculation, it addresses itself to\r\n    examination of the actual organization of public authority and of\r\n    the way in which governmental function is carried out. In 'The\r\n    Government of European Cities' (Macmillan), Prof. William Bennett\r\n    Munro of Harvard has made a valuable addition to this literature.\r\n    He gives a detailed account of the way in which municipal\r\n    government is formed and carried on in France, Germany, and\r\n    England. The style is clear, straightforward, and unpretentious,\r\n    and the treatment is steadily confined to the subject in hand\r\n    without any attempt to point a moral or aid a cause. At the same\r\n    time references to American municipal methods frequently occur as\r\n    incidents of the explanation of European procedure, and these add\r\n    to the value of the book for American readers. The writing, while\r\n    succinct, is copious in detail, and only administrative experts in\r\n    the countries respectively considered could check off all the\r\n    statements made; but the work itself affords intrinsic evidence of\r\n    its painstaking accuracy.
