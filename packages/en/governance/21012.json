I.\r\n\r\nTORONTO:\r\nWILLIAM BRIGGS, 80 KING STREET EAST;\r\nJAMES CAMPBELL & SON, AND\r\nWILLING & WILLIAMSON.\r\nMONTREAL: DAWSON BROTHERS.\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nENTERED, according to the Act of the Parliament of Canada, in the year\r\nOne thousand eight hundred and eighty, by the REV. EGERTON RYERSON,\r\nD.D., LL.D., in the Office of the Minister of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs no Indian pen has ever traced the history of the aborigines of\r\nAmerica, or recorded the deeds of their chieftains, their \"prowess and\r\ntheir wrongs\"--their enemies and spoilers being their historians; so the\r\nhistory of the Loyalists of America has never been written except by\r\ntheir enemies and spoilers, and those English historians who have not\r\ntroubled themselves with examining original authorities, but have\r\nadopted the authorities, and in some instances imbibed the spirit, of\r\nAmerican historians, who have never tired in eulogizing Americans and\r\neverything American, and deprecating everything English, and all who\r\nhave loyally adhered to the unity of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nI have thought that the other side of the story should be written; or,\r\nin other words, the true history of the relations, disputes, and\r\ncontests between Great Britain and her American colonies and the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nThe United Empire Loyalists were the losing party; their history has\r\nbeen written by their adversaries, and strangely misrepresented. In the\r\nvindication of their character, I have not opposed assertion against\r\nassertion; but, in correction of unjust and untrue assertions, I have\r\noffered the records and documents of the actors themselves, and in their\r\nown words. To do this has rendered my history, to a large extent,\r\n_documentary_, instead of being a mere popular narrative. The many\r\nfictions of American writers will be found corrected and exposed in the\r\nfollowing volumes, by authorities and facts which cannot be successfully\r\ndenied. In thus availing myself so largely of the proclamations,\r\nmessages, addresses, letters, and records of the times when they\r\noccurred, I have only followed the example of some of the best\r\nhistorians and biographers.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more sensible than myself of the imperfect manner in which\r\nI have performed my task, which I commenced more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury since, but I have been prevented from completing it sooner by\r\npublic duties--pursuing, as I have done from the beginning, an untrodden\r\npath of historical investigations. From the long delay, many supposed I\r\nwould never complete the work, or that I had abandoned it. On its\r\ncompletion, therefore, I issued a circular, an extract from which I\r\nhereto subjoin, explaining the origin, design, and scope of the work:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have pleasure in stating that I have at length completed the\r\n     task which the newspaper press and public men of different parties\r\n     urged upon me from 1855 to 1860. In submission to what seemed to be\r\n     public opinion, I issued, in 1861, a circular addressed to the\r\n     United Empire Loyalists and their descendants, of the British\r\n     Provinces of America, stating the design and scope of my proposed\r\n     work, and requesting them to transmit to me, at my expense, any\r\n     letters or papers in their possession which would throw light upon\r\n     the early history and settlement in these Provinces by our U.E.\r\n     Loyalist forefathers. From all the British Provinces I received\r\n     answers to my circular; and I have given, with little abridgment,\r\n     in one chapter of my history, these intensely interesting letters\r\n     and papers--to which I have been enabled to add considerably from\r\n     two large quarto manuscript volumes of papers relating to the U.E.\r\n     Loyalists in the Dominion Parliamentary Library at Ottawa, with the\r\n     use of which I have been favoured by the learned and obliging\r\n     librarian, Mr. Todd.\r\n\r\n     \"In addition to all the works relating to the subject which I could\r\n     collect in Europe and America, I spent, two years since, several\r\n     months in the Library of the British Museum, employing the\r\n     assistance of an amanuensis, in verifying quotations and making\r\n     extracts from works not to be found elsewhere, in relation\r\n     especially to unsettled questions involved in the earlier part of\r\n     my history.\r\n\r\n     \"I have entirely sympathized with the Colonists in their\r\n     remonstrances, and even use of arms, in defence of British\r\n     constitutional rights, from 1763 to 1776; but I have been compelled\r\n     to view the proceedings of the Revolutionists and their treatment\r\n     of the Loyalists in a very different light.\r\n\r\n     \"After having compared the conduct of the two parties during the\r\n     Revolution, the exile of the Loyalists from their homes after the\r\n     close of the War, and their settlement in the British Provinces, I\r\n     have given a brief account of the government of each Province, and\r\n     then traced the alleged and real causes of the War of 1812-1815,\r\n     together with the courage, sacrifice, and patriotism of Canadians,\r\n     both English and French, in defending our country against eleven\r\n     successive American invasions, when the population of the two\r\n     Canadas was to that of the United States as one to twenty-seven,\r\n     and the population of Upper Canada (the chief scene of the War) was\r\n     as one to one hundred and six. Our defenders, aided by a few\r\n     English regiments, were as handfuls, little Spartan bands, in\r\n     comparison of the hosts of the invading armies; and yet at the end\r\n     of two years, as well as at the end of the third and last year of\r\n     the War, not an invader's foot found a place on the soil of Canada.\r\n\r\n     \"I undertook this work not self-moved and with no view to profit;\r\n     and if I receive no pecuniary return from this work, on which I\r\n     have expended no small labour and means, I shall have the\r\n     satisfaction of having done all in my power to erect an historical\r\n     monument to the character and merits of the fathers and founders of\r\n     my native country.\"\r\n\r\nE. RYERSON.\r\n\r\n\"TORONTO, Sept. 24th, 1879.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--TWO CLASSES OF EMIGRANTS--TWO GOVERNMENTS FOR SEVENTY\r\nYEARS--THE PILGRIM FATHERS, THEIR PILGRIMAGES AND SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\n\r\nThe writer a native Colonist                                              1\r\n\r\nMassachusetts the seed-plot of the American Revolution                    1\r\n\r\nTwo distinct emigrations to New England--the \"Pilgrim\r\nFathers\" in 1620, the \"Puritan Fathers\" in 1629;

The one class of these emigrants were called\r\n\"Pilgrim Fathers,\" having first fled from England to Holland, and thence\r\nemigrated to New England in 1620, in the _Mayflower_, and called their\r\nplace of settlement \"New Plymouth,\" where they elected seven Governors\r\nin succession, and existed under a self-constituted government for\r\nseventy years. The other class were called \"Puritan Fathers;\" the first\r\ninstalment of their emigration took place in 1629, under Endicot; they\r\nwere known as the Massachusetts Bay Company, and their final capital was\r\nBoston, which afterwards became the capital of the Province and of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the separate and independent government of these\r\ntwo classes of Puritans were widely different. The one was tolerant and\r\nnon-persecuting, and loyal to the King during the whole period of its\r\nseventy years' existence; the other was an intolerant persecutor of all\r\nreligionists who did not adopt its worship, and disloyal from the\r\nbeginning to the Government from which it held its Charter.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to my purpose to compare and contrast the proceedings of\r\nthese two governments in relation to religious liberty and loyalty. I\r\nwill first give a short account of the origin and government of the\r\n\"_Pilgrim_ Fathers\" of New Plymouth, and then the government of the\r\n\"_Puritan_ Fathers\" of Massachusetts Bay.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the later years of Queen Elizabeth, a \"fiery young clergyman,\" named\r\nRobert Brown, declared against the lawfulness of both Episcopal and\r\nPresbyterian Church government, or of fellowship with either\r\nEpiscopalians or Presbyterians, and in favour of the absolute\r\nindependence of each congregation, and the ordination as well as\r\nselection of the minister by it. This was the origin of the Independents\r\nin England. The zeal of Brown, like that of most violent zealots, soon\r\ncooled, and he returned and obtained a living again in the Church of\r\nEngland, which he possessed until his death; but his principles of\r\nseparation and independence survived. The first congregation was formed\r\nabout the year 1602, near the confines of York, Nottingham, and\r\nLeicester, and chose for its pastor John Robinson. They gathered for\r\nworship secretly, and were compelled to change their places of meeting\r\nin order to elude the pursuit of spies and soldiers. After enduring many\r\ncruel sufferings, Robinson, with the greater part of his congregation,\r\ndetermined to escape persecution by becoming _pilgrims_ in a foreign\r\nland. The doctrines of Arminius, and the advocacy and sufferings of his\r\nfollowers in the cause of religious liberty, together with the spirit of\r\ncommerce, had rendered the Government of Holland the most tolerant in\r\nEurope; and thither Robinson and his friends fled from their persecuting\r\npursuers in 1608, and finally settled at Leyden. Being Independents,\r\nthey did not form a connection with any of the Protestant Churches of\r\nthe country. Burke remarks that \"In Holland, though a country of the\r\ngreatest religious freedom in the world, they did not find themselves\r\nbetter satisfied than they had been in England. There they were\r\ntolerated, indeed, but watched; their zeal began to have dangerous\r\nlanguors for want of opposition; and being without power or consequence,\r\nthey grew tired of the indolent security of their sanctuary; they chose\r\nto remove to a place where they should see no superior, and therefore\r\nthey sent an agent to England, who agreed with the Council of Plymouth\r\nfor a tract of land in America, within their jurisdiction, to settle in,\r\nand obtained from the King (James) permission to do so.\"[2]\r\n\r\nDuring their twelve years' _pilgrimage_ in Holland they were good\r\ncitizens; not an accusation was brought against any one of them in the\r\ncourts; they were honourable and industrious, and took to new trades for\r\nsubsistence. Brewster, a man of property, and a gentleman in England,\r\nlearned to be a printer at the age of forty-five. Bradford, who had been\r\na farmer in England, became a silk-dyer. Robinson became noted as a\r\npreacher and controversialist against Arminianism.\r\n\r\nBradford, the historian of their colony and its Governor for eleven\r\nyears, gives the chief reasons for their dispute in Holland and of their\r\ndesire to remove to America.[3]\r\n\r\nAs to what particular place these Pilgrims should select for settlement\r\nin America, some were for Guiana, some for Virginia; but they at length\r\nobtained a patent from the second or Northern Virginia Company for a\r\nsettlement on the northern part of their territory, which extended to\r\nthe fortieth degree of North latitude--Hutchinson Bay. \"The Dutch\r\nlaboured to persuade them to go to the Hudson river, and settle under\r\nthe West India Company; but they had not lost their affection for the\r\nEnglish, and chose to be under their government and protection.\"[4]\r\nBancroft, after quoting the statement that \"upon their talking of\r\nremoving, sundry of the Dutch would have them go under them, and made\r\nthem large offers,\" remarks: \"But the Pilgrims were attached to their\r\nnationality as Englishmen, and to the language of their times. A secret\r\nbut deeply-seated love of their country led them to the generous purpose\r\nof recovering the protection of England by enlarging her dominions. They\r\nwere restless with the desire to live once more under the government of\r\ntheir native land.\"[5] It appears from Bradford's History, as well as\r\nfrom his Letter Book, and other narratives, that there were serious\r\ndisputes and recriminations among the Pilgrim exiles and their friends\r\nin England, before matters could be arranged for their departure. But\r\nonly \"the minor part [of Robinson's congregation], with Mr. Brewster,\r\ntheir elder, resolved to enter upon this great work.\" They embarked at\r\nDelft Haven, a seaport town on the River Maeser, eight miles from Delft,\r\nfourteen miles from Leyden, and thirty-six miles from Amsterdam. The\r\nlast port from which they sailed in England was Southampton; and after a\r\ntempestuous passage of 65 days, in the _Mayflower_, of 181 tons, with\r\n101 passengers, they spied land, which proved to be Cape Cod--about 150\r\nmiles north of their intended place of destination. The pilot of the\r\nvessel had been there before and recognised the land as Cape Cod; \"the\r\nwhich,\" says Bradford, \"being made and certainly known to be it, they\r\nwere not a little joyful.\"[6] But though the Pilgrims were \"not a\r\nlittle joyful\" at safely reaching the American coast, and at a place so\r\nwell known as Cape Cod; yet as that was not their intended place of\r\nsettlement, they, without landing, put again to sea for Hudson river\r\n(New York), but were driven back by stress of weather, and, on account\r\nof the lateness of the season, determined not to venture out to sea\r\nagain, but to seek a place of settlement within the harbour.\r\n\r\nAs the Pilgrims landed north of the limits of the Company from which\r\nthey received their patent, and under which they expected to become a\r\n\"body politic,\" it became to them \"void and useless.\" This being known,\r\nsome of the emigrants on board the _Mayflower_ began to make \"mutinous\r\nspeeches,\" saying that \"when they came ashore they would use their own\r\nliberty, for none had power to command them.\" Under these circumstances\r\nit was thought necessary to \"begin with a combination, which might be as\r\nfirm as any patent, and in some respects more so.\" Accordingly, an\r\nagreement was drawn up and signed in the cabin of the _Mayflower_ by\r\nforty-one male passengers, who with their families constituted the whole\r\ncolony of one hundred and one.[7] Having thus provided against disorder\r\nand faction, the Pilgrims proceeded to land, when, as Bradford says,\r\nthey \"fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven who had\r\nbrought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from\r\nall the perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the\r\nfirm and stable earth, their proper element.\"[8] Of the manner of their\r\nsettlement, their exposures, sufferings, labours, successes, I leave the\r\nmany ordinary histories to narrate, though they nearly all revel in the\r\nmarvellous.[9]\r\n\r\nI will therefore proceed to give a brief account of the Plymouth\r\ngovernment in relation to religious liberty within its limits and\r\nloyalty to the Mother Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the nature of the facts and questions discussed, the\r\nfollowing history is largely _documentary_ rather than popular; and the\r\nwork being an _historical argument_ rather than a popular narrative,\r\nwill account for repetitions in some chapters, that the vital facts of\r\nthe whole argument may be kept as constantly as possible before the mind\r\nof the reader.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Burke's (the celebrated Edmund) Account of European\r\nSettlements in America.

But this\r\nis all fancy; there is no foundation for it in the statement of Governor\r\nBradford, who was one of the passengers, and who says that they were\r\n\"not a little joyful\" when they found certainly that the land was Cape\r\nCod; and afterwards, speaking of their coasting in the neighbourhood,\r\nBradford says, \"They hasted to a place that their pilot (one Willm.\r\nCoppin, _who had been there before_) did assure them was a good harbour,\r\nwhich he had been in.\" (History of Plymouth Plantation, p. 86.) They did\r\nnot even go ashore on their first entrance into Cape Cod harbour; but,\r\nas Bradford says, \"after some deliberation among themselves and with the\r\nmaster of the ship, they _tacked about_ and resolved to stand for the\r\n_southward, to find some place about Hudson river for their\r\nhabitation_.\" (_Ib._, p. 117.) \"After sailing southward half a day, they\r\nfound themselves suddenly among shoals and breakers\" (a ledge of rocks\r\nand shoals which are a terror to navigators to this day); and the wind\r\nshifting against them, they scud back to Cape Cod, and, as Bradford\r\nsays, \"thought themselves happy to get out of those dangers before night\r\novertook them, and the next day they got into the Cape harbour, where\r\nthey rode in safety. Being thus arrived in a good harbour, and brought\r\nsafe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe selection, before leaving England, of the neighbourhood of the\r\nHudson river as their location, showed a worldly sagacity not to be\r\nexceeded by any emigrants even of the present century. Bancroft\r\ndesignates it \"the best position on the whole coast.\" (History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. I., p. 209.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The agreement was as follows:--\"In the name of God, Amen.\r\nWe whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread\r\nSovereign Lord, King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain,\r\nFrance and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c., having undertaken,\r\nfor the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith, and honour\r\nof our King and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the\r\nnorthern parts of [then called] Virginia, do by these presents, solemnly\r\nand mutually, in the presence of God and of one another, covenant and\r\ncombine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better\r\nordering and preservation, and furthermore of the ends aforesaid; and by\r\nvirtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame such just laws,\r\nordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as\r\nshall be thought most mete and convenient for the general good of the\r\ncolony, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In\r\nwitness whereof we have hereunder subscribed our names at Cape Cod, the\r\n11th of November, in the 18th year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord\r\nKing James, of England, France, and Ireland the eighteenth, and of\r\nScotland the fifty-fourth. Anno Dom. 1620.\" Mr. John Carver was chosen\r\nGovernor for one year.\r\n\r\nThis simple and excellent instrument of union and government, suggested\r\nby apprehensions of disorder and anarchy, in the absence of a patent for\r\ncommon protection, has been magnified by some American writers into an\r\nalmost supernatural display of wisdom and foresight, and even the\r\nresurrection of the rights of humanity. Bancroft says, \"This was the\r\nbirth of popular constitutional liberty. The middle ages had been\r\nfamiliar with charters and constitutions; but they had been merely\r\ncompacts for immunities, partial enfranchisements, patents of nobility,\r\nconcessions of municipal privileges, or the limitations of sovereign in\r\nfavour of feudal institutions. In the cabin of the _Mayflower_ humanity\r\nrecorded its rights, and instituted a government on the basis of 'equal\r\nlaws' for the 'general good.'\" (History of the United States, Vol. I, p.\r\n310.)\r\n\r\nNow, any reader of the agreement will see that it says not a word about\r\n\"popular constitutional liberty,\" much less of the \"rights of humanity.\"\r\nIt was no Declaration of Independence. Its signers call themselves\r\n\"loyal subjects of the King of England,\" and state one object of their\r\nemigration to be the \"honour of our King and country.\" The Pilgrim\r\nFathers did, in the course of time, establish a simple system of popular\r\ngovernment; but from the written compact signed in the cabin of the\r\n_Mayflower_ any form of government might be developed. The good sense of\r\nthe following remarks by Dr. Young, in his _Chronicles of the Pilgrims\r\nof Plymouth_, contrast favourably with the fanciful hyperboles of\r\nBancroft: \"It seems to me that a great deal more has been discovered in\r\nthis document than the signers contemplated. It is evident that when\r\nthey left Holland they expected to become a body politic, using among\r\nthemselves civil government, and to choose their own rulers from among\r\nthemselves. Their purpose in drawing up and signing this compact was\r\nsimply, as they state, to restrain certain of their number who had\r\nmanifested an unruly and factious disposition. This was the whole\r\nphilosophy of the instrument, whatever may have since been discovered\r\nand deduced from it.\" (p. 120.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Bradford's History of the Plymouth Plantation, p. 78. \"The\r\n31st of December (1620) being Sabbath, they attended Divine service for\r\nthe first time on shore, and named the place _Plymouth_, partly because\r\nthis harbour was so called in Capt. John Smith's map, published three or\r\nfour years before, and partly in remembrance of very kind treatment\r\nwhich they had received from the inhabitants of the last port of their\r\nnative country from which they sailed.\" (Moore's Lives of the Governors\r\nof Plymouth, pp. 37, 38.)\r\n\r\nThe original Indian name of the place was _Accomack_; but at the time\r\nthe Pilgrims settled there, an Indian informed them it was called\r\n_Patuxet_. Capt. John Smith's Description of New England was published\r\nin 1616. He says, \"I took the description as well by map as writing, and\r\ncalled it New England.\" He dedicated his work to Prince Charles\r\n(afterwards King Charles II.), begging him to change the \"barbarous\r\nnames.\" In the list of names changed by Prince Charles, _Accomack_ (or\r\nPatuxet) was altered to _Plymouth_. Mr. Dermer, employed by Sir F.\r\nGorges and others for purposes of discovery and trade, visited this\r\nplace about four months before the arrival of the Pilgrims, and\r\nsignificantly said, \"I would that Plymouth [in England] had the like\r\ncommodities. I would that the first plantation might here be seated if\r\nthere come to the number of fifty persons or upward.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See following Note:--\r\n\r\nNOTE _on the Inflated American Accounts of the Voyage and Settlement of\r\nthe Pilgrim Fathers_.--Everything relating to the character, voyage, and\r\nsettlement of the Pilgrims in New England has been invested with the\r\nmarvellous, if not supernatural, by most American writers. One of them\r\nsays, \"God not only sifted the three kingdoms to get the seed of this\r\nenterprise, but sifted that seed over again. Every person whom He would\r\nnot have go at that time, to plant the first colony of New England, He\r\nsent back even from mid-ocean in the _Speedwell_.\" (Rev. Dr. Cheever's\r\nJournal of the Pilgrims.)\r\n\r\nThe simple fact was, that the _Mayflower_ could not carry any more\r\npassengers than she brought, and therefore most of the passengers of the\r\n_Speedwell_, which was a vessel of 50 tons and proved to be unseaworthy,\r\nwere compelled to remain until the following year, and came over in the\r\n_Fortune_; and among these Robert Cushman, with his family, one of the\r\nmost distinguished and honoured of the Pilgrim Fathers. And there was\r\ndoubtless as good \"seed\" in \"the three kingdoms\" after this \"sifting\" of\r\nthem for the New England enterprise as there was before.\r\n\r\nIn one of his speeches, the late eloquent Governor Everett, of\r\nMassachusetts, describes their voyage as the \"long, cold, dreary\r\nautumnal passage, in that one solitary, adventurous vessel, the\r\n_Mayflower_ of forlorn hope, freighted with prospects of a future state,\r\nand bound across the unknown sea, pursuing, with a thousand misgivings,\r\nthe uncertain, the tedious voyage, suns rise and set, and winter\r\nsurprises them on the deep, but brings them not the sight of the\r\nwished-for shore. The awful voice of the storm howls through the\r\nrigging. The labouring masts seem straining from their base; the dismal\r\nsound of the pumps is heard; the ship leaps, as it were, madly from\r\nbillow to billow; the ocean breaks, and settles with engulfing floods\r\nover the floating deck, and beats with deadening, shivering weight\r\nagainst the staggering vessel.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine how \"winter\" could surprise passengers\r\ncrossing the ocean between the 6th of September and the 9th of\r\nNovember--a season of the year much _chosen_ even nowadays for crossing\r\nthe Atlantic. It is equally difficult to conceive how that could have\r\nbeen an \"unknown sea\" which had been crossed and the New England coasts\r\nexplored by Gosnold, Smith, Dermer and others (all of whom had published\r\naccounts of their voyage), besides more than a dozen fishing vessels\r\nwhich had crossed this very year to obtain fish and furs in the\r\nneighbourhood and north of Cape Cod. Doubtless often the \"suns rose and\r\nset\" upon these vessels without their seeing the \"wished-for shore;\" and\r\nprobably more than once, \"the awful voice of the storm howled through\r\ntheir rigging,\" and \"the dismal sound of their pumps was heard,\" and\r\nthey \"madly leaped from billow to billow,\" and \"staggered under the\r\ndeadening, shivering weight of the broken ocean,\" and with its\r\n\"engulfing floods\" over their \"floating decks.\" The _Mayflower_ was a\r\nvessel of 180 tons burden--more than twice as large as any of the\r\nvessels in which the early English, French, and Spanish discoverers of\r\nAmerica made their voyages--much larger than most of the vessels\r\nemployed in carrying emigrants to Virginia during the previous ten\r\nyears--more than three times as large as the ship _Fortune_, of 53 tons,\r\nwhich crossed the ocean the following year, and arrived at Plymouth also\r\nthe 9th of November, bringing Mr. Cushman and the rest of the passengers\r\nleft by the _Speedwell_ the year before. Gosnold had crossed the ocean\r\nand explored the eastern coasts of America in 1602 in a \"small bark;\"\r\nMartin Pring had done the same in 1603 in the bark _Discovery_, of 26\r\ntons; Frobisher, in northern and dangerous coasts, in a vessel of 25\r\ntons burden; and two of the vessels of Columbus were from 15 to 30 tons\r\nburden, and without decks on which to \"float\" the \"engulfing floods\"\r\nunder which the _Mayflower_ \"staggered\" so marvellously. All these\r\nvessels long preceded the _Mayflower_ across the \"unknown ocean;\" but\r\nnever inspired the lofty eloquence which Mr. Everett and a host of\r\ninferior rhapsodists have bestowed upon the _Mayflower_ and her voyage.\r\nBancroft fills several pages of his elaborate history to the same\r\neffect, and in similar style with the passages above quoted. I will give\r\na single sentence, as follows:--\"The Pilgrims having selected for their\r\nsettlement the country near the Hudson, the best position on the whole\r\ncoast, were conducted to the most barren and inhospitable part of\r\nMassachusetts.\" (History of the United States, Vol. 1., p. 309.)\r\n\r\nThere was certainly little self-abnegation, but much sound and worldly\r\nwisdom, in the Pilgrims selecting \"the best position on the whole coast\"\r\nof America for their settlement; and there is as little truth in the\r\nstatement, though a good antithesis--the delight of Mr. Bancroft--that\r\nthe Pilgrims were conducted to \"the most barren and inhospitable part of\r\nMassachusetts\" for \"actual settlement,\" as appears from the descriptions\r\ngiven of it by Governors Winslow and Bradford and other Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nwritten after the first and during the subsequent years of their\r\nsettlement. I will give but two illustrations. Mr. Winslow was one of\r\nthe passengers in the _Mayflower_, and was, by annual election, several\r\nyears Governor of the Plymouth colony. It has been stated above that the\r\nship _Fortune_, of 53 tons burden, brought in the autumn of 1621 the\r\nPilgrim passengers who had been left in England the year before by the\r\nsea-unworthiness of the _Speedwell_. The _Fortune_ anchored in Plymouth\r\nBay the 9th of November--just a year from the day on which the\r\n_Mayflower_ spied the land of Cape Cod. Mr. Winslow prepared and sent\r\nback by the _Fortune_ an elaborate \"Relation\" of the state and prospects\r\nof the colony, for the information of the merchant adventurers and\r\nothers in England. He describes the climate, soil, and all the resources\r\nof the colony's means of support, together with the process and result\r\nof the first year's labour. I will simply give his account of the manner\r\nin which they celebrated what in England would be called a \"Harvest\r\nHome.\" He says: \"Our harvest being got in, our Governor sent four men on\r\nfowling, that so we might, after a more special manner, rejoice together\r\nafter we had gathered the fruit of our labours. They four in a day\r\nkilled as much fowl as, with little help besides, served the company\r\nalmost a week; at which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised\r\nour arms. Many of the Indians came amongst us, and amongst the rest\r\ntheir greatest king, Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three\r\ndays we entertained and feasted; and they went out and killed fine deer,\r\nwhich they brought to the Plantation, and bestowed them on our Governor,\r\nand upon the Captain and others; and although it be not always so\r\nplentiful with us, we are so far from want that we _often wish you\r\npartakers of our plenty_.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Bradford, writing in 1646, twenty-five years after this feast,\r\nand referring to it, says: \"Nor has there been any general want of food\r\namongst us since to this day.\" (Morton's Memorials, p. 100.)\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the first year's experience in this chosen place\r\nof settlement by the first New England colony, as stated by the most\r\ndistinguished of its founders. During the winter of this year more than\r\nhalf the pioneer settlers had died of a prevalent sickness,--not owing\r\nto the climate, but their sea voyage, their want of experience, and to\r\ntemporary circumstances, for not a death occurred amongst them during\r\nthe three succeeding years. As great as was the mortality amongst the\r\nnoble colonists of New England, it was far less, comparatively, than\r\nthat which fell upon the first colonists of Virginia, who were, also,\r\nmore than once almost annihilated by the murderous incursions of the\r\nIndians, but from whom the Pilgrim Fathers did not suffer the loss of a\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn his \"true and brief Relation,\" Mr. Winslow says: \"For the temper of\r\nthe air here, it agreeth well with that in England; and if there be any\r\ndifference at all, this is somewhat hotter in summer. Some think it\r\ncolder in winter, but I cannot out of experience say so. The air is very\r\nclear and foggy, not as hath been reported. I never in my life remember\r\na more seasonable year than we have here enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Winslow's doubt as to whether the cold of his first winter in New\r\nEngland exceeded that of the ordinary winters which he had passed in\r\nEngland, refutes the fictitious representations of many writers, who to\r\nmagnify the virtues and merits of the Plymouth colonists, describe them\r\nas braving, with a martyr's courage, the appalling cold of an almost\r\nArctic winter--a winter which enabled the new settlers to commence their\r\ngardens the 16th of March, and they add in their Journal: \"Monday and\r\nTuesday, March 19th and 20th, proved fair days. We digged our grounds\r\nand _sowed our garden seeds_.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of the American United Empire Loyalists--the Pilgrim Fathers of\r\nCanada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick--could tell of a winter in the\r\ncountries of their refuge, so mild, and a spring so early and genial, as\r\nthat which favoured the Pilgrim Fathers of New England during their\r\nfirst year of settlement; nor had any settlement of the Canadian Pilgrim\r\nFathers been able to command the means of celebrating the _first_\r\n\"Harvest Home\" by a week's festivity and amusements, and entertaining,\r\nin addition, ninety Indians for three days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE PILGRIM[10] FATHERS DURING SEVENTY YEARS, FROM\r\n1620 TO 1692, AS DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE PURITAN FATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO GOVERNMENTS.--_Difference between the Government of the Pilgrims and\r\nthat of the Puritans_.--Most historians, both English and American, have\r\nscarcely or not at all noticed the fact that within the present State of\r\nMassachusetts two separate governments of Puritan emigrants were\r\nestablished and existed for seventy years--two governments as distinct\r\nas those of Upper and Lower Canada from 1791 to 1840--as distinct as\r\nthose of any two States of the American Republic. It is quite natural\r\nthat American historians should say nothing of the Pilgrim government,\r\nbeyond the voyage and landing of its founders, as it was a standing\r\ncondemnation of the Puritan government, on which they bestow all their\r\neulogies. The two governments were separated by the Bay of\r\nMassachusetts, about forty miles distant from each other by water, but\r\nstill more widely different from each other in spirit and character. The\r\ngovernment of the Pilgrims was marked from the beginning by a full and\r\nhearty recognition of franchise rights to all settlers of the Christian\r\nfaith; the government of the Puritans denied those rights to all but\r\nCongregational Church members for sixty years, and until they were\r\ncompelled to do otherwise by Royal Charter in 1692. The government of\r\nthe Pilgrims was just and kind to the Indians, and early made a treaty\r\nwith the neighbouring tribes, which remained inviolate on both sides\r\nduring half a century, from 1621 to 1675; the government of the\r\nPuritans maddened the Indians by the invasion of their rights, and\r\ndestroyed them by multitudes, almost to entire extermination. The\r\ngovernment of the Pilgrims respected the principles of religious liberty\r\n(which they had learned and imbibed in Holland), did not persecute those\r\nwho differed from it in religious opinions,[11] and gave protection to\r\nmany who fled from the persecutions of neighbouring Puritans'\r\ngovernment, which was more intolerant and persecuting to those who\r\ndiffered from it in religious opinions than that of James, and Charles,\r\nand Laud had ever been to them. The government of the Pilgrims was frank\r\nand loyal to the Sovereign and people of England; the government of the\r\nPuritans was deceptive and disloyal to the Throne and Mother Country\r\nfrom the first, and sedulously sowed and cultivated the seeds of\r\ndisaffection and hostility to the Royal government, until they grew and\r\nripened into the harvest of the American revolution.\r\n\r\nThese statements will be confirmed and illustrated by the facts of the\r\npresent and following chapters.\r\n\r\nThe compact into which the Pilgrims entered before landing from the\r\n_Mayflower_, was the substitute for the body politic which would have\r\nbeen organized by charter had they settled, as first intended, within\r\nthe limits of the Northern Virginia Company. The compact specified no\r\nconstitution of government beyond that of authority on the one hand, and\r\nsubmission on the other; but under it the Governors were elected\r\nannually, and the local laws were enacted during eighteen years _by the\r\ngeneral meetings of the settlers_, after which a body of elected\r\nrepresentatives was constituted.\r\n\r\nThe first _official record_ of the election of any Governor was in 1633,\r\nthirteen years after their settlement at Plymouth; but, according to the\r\nearly history of the Pilgrims, the Governors were elected annually from\r\n1620. The Governors of the colony were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. John Carver, in 1620, who died a few months afterwards;\r\n\r\n2. William Bradford, 1621 to 1632, 1635, 1637, 1639 to 1643, 1645 to\r\n1656;\r\n\r\n3. Edward Winslow, 1633, 1636, 1644;\r\n\r\n4. Thomas Prince, 1634, 1638, 1657 to 1672;\r\n\r\n5. Josiah Winslow, 1673 to 1680;\r\n\r\n6. Thomas Hinckley, 1681 to 1692;[12]\r\n\r\nwhen the colony of Plymouth[13] (which had never increased in population\r\nbeyond 13,000) was incorporated with that of Massachusetts Bay, under\r\nthe name of the Province of Massachusetts, by Royal Charter under\r\nWilliam and Mary, and by which religious liberty and the elective\r\nfranchise were secured to all freeholders of forty shillings per annum,\r\ninstead of being confined to members of the Congregational Churches, as\r\nhad been the case down to that period under the Puritans of\r\nMassachusetts Bay--so that equal civil and religious liberty among all\r\nclasses was established in Massachusetts, not by the Puritans, but by\r\nRoyal Charter, against the practice of the Puritans from 1631 to 1692.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Pilgrims was of the most simple kind. At first the\r\nGovernor, with one assistant, was elected annually by general suffrage;\r\nbut in 1624, at the request of Governor Bradford, a Council of five\r\nassistants (increased to seven in 1633) was annually elected. In this\r\nCourt, or Executive Council, the Governor had a double vote. In the\r\nthird year, 1623, trial by jury was established. During eighteen years,\r\nfrom 1620 to 1638, the legislative body, called the General Court, or\r\nCourt of Associates, was composed of the whole body of freemen. It was\r\nnot until 1639 that they established a House of Representatives. The\r\nqualifications of a _freeman_ were, that he \"should be twenty-one years\r\nof age, of sober, peaceable conversation, orthodox in religion [which\r\nincluded belief in God and the Holy Scriptures, but did not include any\r\nform of Church government], and possess rateable estate to the value of\r\ntwenty pounds.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1636--sixteen years after their landing at New Plymouth--the laws\r\nwhich they had enacted were first collected, prefaced by a declaration\r\nof their right to enact them, in the absence of a Royal Charter. Their\r\nlaws were at various times revised and added to, and finally printed in\r\n1671, under the title of \"Their Great Fundamentals.\" They recognized the\r\ngeneral laws of England, and adopted local statutes or regulations\r\naccording to what they considered their needs.[14] Of their sense of\r\nduty as British subjects, and of the uniform mutual relations of\r\nfriendship existing between them and their Sovereigns, their records and\r\nhistory furnish abundant proofs. The oath required of their Governors\r\ncommenced in the following words: \"You shall swear to be truly loyal to\r\nour Sovereign Lord King Charles, his successors and heirs.\" \"At the\r\nCourt held,\" (says the record,) \"at Plymouth, the 11th of June, 1664,\r\nthe following was added, and the Governor took the oath thereunto: 'You\r\nshall also attend to what is required by His Majesty's Privy Council of\r\nthe Governors of the respective colonies in reference unto an Act of\r\nParliament for the encouraging and increasing of shipping and\r\nnavigation, bearing date from the 1st of December, 1660.'\"\r\n\r\nThe oath of a freeman commenced with the same words, as did the oath of\r\nthe \"Assistants\" or Executive Councillors, the oath of constables and\r\nother officers in the colony. It was likewise ordered, \"That an oath of\r\nallegiance to the King and fidelity to the Government and to the several\r\ncolonies [settlements] therein, be taken of every person that shall live\r\nwithin or under the same.\" This was as follows: \"You shall be truly\r\nloyal to our Sovereign Lord the King and his heirs and successors: and\r\nwhereas you make choice at present to reside within the government of\r\nNew Plymouth, you shall not do or cause to be done any act or acts,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by land or water, that shall or may tend to the\r\ndestruction or overthrow of the whole or any of the several colonies\r\n[settlements] within the said government that are or shall be orderly\r\nerected or established; but shall, contrariwise, hinder, oppose and\r\ndiscover such intents and purposes as tend thereunto to the Governor for\r\nthe time being, or some one of the assistants, with all convenient\r\nspeed. You shall also submit unto and obey such good and wholesome laws,\r\nordinances and officers as are or shall be established within the\r\nseveral limits thereof. So help you God, who is the God of truth and\r\npunisher of falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government of Plymouth prefaced the revised collection of their laws\r\nand ordinances as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A form to be placed before the records of the several inheritances\r\ngranted to all and every of the King's subjects inhabiting with the\r\nGovernment of New Plymouth:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas John Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, William\r\nBrewster, Isaack Alliston and divers others of the subjects of our late\r\nSovereign Lord James, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland,\r\nFrance and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c., did in the eighteenth\r\nyear of his reigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the\r\nfifty-four, which was the year of our Lord God 1620, undertake a voyage\r\ninto that part of America called Virginia or New England, thereunto\r\nadjoining, there to erect a plantation and colony of English, intending\r\nthe glory of God and the enlargement of his Majesty's dominions, and the\r\nspecial good of the English nation.\"\r\n\r\nThus the laws and ordinances of the Plymouth Government, and the oaths\r\nof office from the Governor to the constable, freeman and transient\r\nresident, recognize their duty as British subjects, and breathe a spirit\r\nof pure loyalty to their Sovereign. The only reference I find in their\r\nrecords to the Commonwealth of England is the following declaration,\r\nmade in 1658, the last year of Cromwell's government. It is the preface\r\nto the collection of the General Laws, revised and published Sept. 29,\r\n1658, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We, the associates of New Plymouth, coming hither as freeborn subjects\r\nof the State of England, endowed with all the privileges belonging to\r\nsuch, being assembled, do ordain, constitute and enact that no act,\r\nimposition, laws or ordinances be made or imposed on us at present or to\r\ncome, but such as shall be made and imposed by consent of the body of\r\nthe associates or their representatives legally assembled, which is\r\naccording to the free libertie of the State of England.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first annual meeting of the Plymouth House of Representatives\r\nafter the restoration of Charles the Second, the following declaration\r\nand order was made:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas we are certainly informed that it hath pleased God to establish\r\nour Sovereign Lord King Charles the Second in the enjoyment of his\r\nundoubted rights to the Crowns of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,\r\nand is so declared and owned by his good subjects of these kingdoms; We\r\ntherefore, his Majesty's loyal subjects, the inhabitants of the\r\njurisdiction of New Plymouth, do hereby declare our free and ready\r\nconcurrence with such other of his Majesty's subjects, and to his said\r\nMajesty, his heirs and successors, we do most humbly and faithfully\r\nsubmit and oblige ourselves for ever. God save the King.\r\n\r\n\"June the fifth, Anno Dom. 1661.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth day of June, 1661, Charles the Second, King of England,\r\nScotland, France and Ireland, &c., was solemnly proclaimed at Plymouth,\r\nin New England, in America.\" (This the Puritan Government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay refused to do.)\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James the Second we find the following entry in the\r\nPlymouth records: \"The twenty fourth of April, 1685, James the Second,\r\nKing of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, &c., was solemnly\r\nproclaimed at Plymouth according to the form required by his Majesty's\r\nmost honourable Privy Council.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1688 in England, there is the following record\r\nof the proceedings of the Legislature of the Plymouth colony--proceedings\r\nin which testimony is borne by the colonists of the uniformly kind\r\ntreatment they had received from the Government of England, except during\r\na short interval under the three years' reign of James the Second:\r\n\r\n\"At their Majesties' General Court of Election, held at Plymouth on the\r\nfirst Tuesday in June, 1689.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, through the great changes Divine Providence hath ordered out,\r\nboth in England and in this country, we the loyal subjects of the Crown\r\nof England are left in an unsettled estate, destitute of government and\r\nexposed to the ill consequences thereof: and _having heretofore enjoyed\r\na quiet settlement of government in this their Majesties' colony of New\r\nPlymouth for more than threescore and six years, without any\r\ninterruptions; having also been by the late kings of England from time\r\nto time, by their royal letters, graciously owned and acknowledged\r\ntherein_: whereby, notwithstanding our late unjust interruption and\r\nsuspension therefrom by the illegal arbitrary power of Sir Edmond\r\nAndros, now ceased, the General Court held there in the name of their\r\npresent Majesties William and Mary, King and Queen of England, &c.,\r\ntogether with the encouragement given by their said Majesties' gracious\r\ndeclarations and in humble confidence of their said Majesties' good\r\nliking: do therefore hereby resume and declare their reassuming of their\r\nsaid former way of government, according to such wholesome\r\nconstitutions, rules and orders as were here in force in June, 1686, our\r\ntitle thereto being warranted by prescription and otherwise as\r\naforesaid; and expect a ready submission thereunto by all their\r\nMajesties' good subjects of this colony, until their Majesties or this\r\nCourt shall otherwise order; and that all our Courts be hereafter held\r\nand all warrants directed and officers sworn in the name of their\r\nMajesties William and Mary, King and Queen of England, &c.\r\n\r\n\"The General Court request the Honourable Governor, Thomas Hinckley,\r\nEsq., in behalf of said Court and Colony of New Plymouth, to make their\r\naddress to their Majesties the King and Queen of England, &c., for the\r\nre-establishment of their former enjoyed liberties and privileges, both\r\nsacred and civil.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus the testimony of the Plymouth colony itself that there was\r\nno attempt on the part of either Charles the First or Second to\r\ninterfere with the fullest exercise of their own chosen form of worship,\r\nor with anything which they themselves regarded as their civil rights.\r\nIf another course of proceedings had to be adopted in regard to the\r\nPuritan Government of Massachusetts Bay, it was occasioned by their own\r\nconduct, as will appear hereafter. Complaints were made by colonists to\r\nEngland of the persecuting and unjust conduct of the Puritan Government,\r\nand inquiries were ordered in 1646, 1664, 1678, and afterwards. The\r\nnature and result of these inquiries will be noticed hereafter. At\r\npresent I will notice the first Commission sent out by Charles the\r\nSecond, in 1664, and which was made general to the several colonies, to\r\navoid invidious distinction, though caused by complaints against the\r\nconduct of the Puritan Government of Massachusetts Bay. The\r\nCommissioners proposed four questions to the Governments of the several\r\ncolonies of New England. I will give the questions, or rather\r\npropositions, and the answers to them on the part of the Pilgrim\r\nGovernment of Plymouth, as contained in its printed records:--\r\n\r\n\"_The Propositions made by His Majesty's Commissioners to the General\r\nCourt of (New Plymouth), held at Plymouth, for the jurisdiction of New\r\nPlymouth, the 22nd of February, Anno Dom. 1665._\r\n\r\n\"1. That all householders inhabiting in the colony take the oath of\r\nallegiance, and the administration of justice be in his Majesty's name.\r\n\r\n\"2. That all men of competent estates and civil conversation, though of\r\ndifferent judgments, may be admitted to be freemen, and have liberty to\r\nchoose and to be chosen officers, both civil and military.\r\n\r\n\"3. That all men and women of orthodox opinions, competent knowledge and\r\ncivil lives (not scandalous), may be admitted to the sacrament of the\r\nLord's Supper, and their children to baptism if they desire it; either\r\nby admitting them into the congregation already gathered, or permitting\r\nthem to gather themselves into such congregations, where they may have\r\nthe benefit of the sacraments.\r\n\r\n\"4. That all laws and expressions in laws derogatory to his Majesty, if\r\nany such have been made in these late troublesome times, may be\r\nrepealed, altered, and taken off from the file.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURT'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\n\"1. To the first we consent, it _having been the practice of this\r\nCourt_, in the first place, _to insert in the oath of fidelity required\r\nof every householder, to be truly loyal to our Sovereign Lord the King,\r\nhis heirs and successors. Also to administer all acts of justice in his\r\nMajesty's name_.\r\n\r\n\"2. To the second we also consent, _it having been our constant practice\r\nto admit men of competent estates and civil conversation, though of\r\ndifferent judgments, yet being otherwise orthodox, to be freemen, and\r\nto have liberty to choose and be chosen officers, both civil and\r\nmilitary_.\r\n\r\n\"3. To the third, we cannot but acknowledge it to be a high favour from\r\nGod and from our Sovereign, that we may enjoy our consciences in point\r\nof God's worship, the main end of transplanting ourselves into these\r\nremote corners of the earth, and should most heartily rejoice that all\r\nour neighbours so qualified as in that proposition would adjoin\r\nthemselves to our societies, according to the order of the Gospel, for\r\nenjoyment of the sacraments to themselves and theirs; but if, through\r\ndifferent persuasions respecting Church government, it cannot be\r\nobtained, we could not deny a liberty to any, according to the\r\nproposition, that are truly conscientious, although differing from us,\r\nespecially where his Majesty commands it, they maintaining an able\r\npreaching ministry for the carrying on of public Sabbath worship, which\r\nwe doubt not is his Majesty's intent, and withdrawing not from paying\r\ntheir due proportions of maintenance to such ministers as are orderly\r\nsettled in the places where they live, until they have one of their own,\r\nand that in such places as are capable of maintaining the worship of God\r\nin two distinct congregations, we being greatly encouraged by his\r\nMajesty's gracious expressions in his letter to us, and your Honours'\r\nfurther assurance of his Royal purpose to continue our liberties, that\r\nwhere places, by reason of our paucity and poverty, are incapable of\r\ntwo, it is not intended, that such congregations as are already in being\r\nshould be rooted out, but their liberties preserved, there being other\r\nplaces to accommodate men of different persuasions in societies by\r\nthemselves, which, by our known experience, tends most to the\r\npreservation of peace and charity.\r\n\r\n\"4. To the fourth, we consent that all laws and expressions in laws\r\nderogatory to his Majesty, if any sect shall be formed amongst us, which\r\nat present we are not conscious of, shall be repealed, altered, and\r\ntaken off from the file.\r\n\r\n\"By order of the General Court\r\nFor the jurisdiction of New Plymouth,\r\nPer me, NATHANIEL MORTON, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The league between the four colonies was not with any intent, that ever\r\nwe heard of, to cast off our dependence upon England, a thing which we\r\nutterly abhor, intreating your Honours to believe us, for we speak in\r\nthe presence of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"NEW PLYMOUTH, May 4th, 1665.\r\n\r\n\"The Court doth order Mr. Constant Southworth, Treasurer, to present\r\nthese to his Majesty's Commissioners, at Boston, with all convenient\r\nspeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe above propositions and answers are inserted, with some variations,\r\nin Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts, Vol. I., p. 214. The remark\r\nrespecting the union between the colonies is not on the colony\r\nrecords--it was inserted at the close of the copy delivered to the\r\nCommissioners, in conformity to a letter from the Commissioners, written\r\nto Governor Prince after they had left Plymouth. The conditions\r\nexpressed in the answer to the third proposition appeared so reasonable\r\nto the Commissioners, that when they afterward met the General Assembly\r\nof Connecticut, in April, 1663, their third proposition is qualified, in\r\nsubstance, conformably to the Plymouth reply. (Morton's Memorial, Davis'\r\nEd., p. 417.)\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that there was not the least desire on the part of King\r\nCharles the Second, any more than there had been on the part of Charles\r\nthe First, to impose the Episcopal worship upon the colonists, or to\r\ninterfere in the least with their full liberty of worship, according to\r\ntheir own preferences. All that was desired at any time was toleration\r\nand acknowledgment of the authority of the Crown, such as the Plymouth\r\ncolony and that of Connecticut had practised from the beginning, to the\r\ngreat annoyance of the Puritans of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters and addresses passed between Charles the Second and the\r\nPilgrim Government of Plymouth, and all of the most cordial character on\r\nboth sides; but what is given above supersedes the necessity of further\r\nquotations.[15]\r\n\r\nIt was an object of special ambition with the Government of Plymouth to\r\nhave a Royal Charter like those of Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and\r\nRhode Island, instead of holding their land, acting under a Charter from\r\nthe Plymouth Council (England) and Charles the Second. In his last\r\naddress to Mr. Josiah Winslow, their Governor promised it to them in\r\nmost explicit terms; but there was a case of _quo warranto_ pending in\r\nthe Court of King's Bench against the Puritan Government for the\r\nviolation of their Charter, which delayed the issuing of a Royal Charter\r\nto Plymouth. Charles died soon after;[16] the Charter of the\r\nMassachusetts Corporation was forfeited by the decision of the Court,\r\nand James the Second appointed a Royal Governor and a Royal\r\nCommissioner, which changed for the time being the whole face of things\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\nIt, however, deserves notice, that the Massachusetts Puritans, true to\r\ntheir instinct of encroaching upon the rights of others, whether of the\r\nKing or of their neighbours, white or tawny, did all in their power to\r\nprevent the Pilgrims of Plymouth--the pioneers of settlement and\r\ncivilization in New England--from obtaining a Royal Charter. This they\r\ndid first in 1630, again in the early part of Charles the Second's\r\nreign, and yet again towards its end. Finally, after the cancelling of\r\nthe Massachusetts Charter, and the English Revolution of 1688, the\r\nagents of the more powerful and populous Massachusetts colony succeeded\r\nin getting the colony of Plymouth absorbed into that of Massachusetts\r\nBay by the second Royal Charter granted by William and Mary in 1692.\r\n\"The junction of Plymouth with Massachusetts,\" says Moore, \"destroyed\r\nall the political consequence of the former. The people of Plymouth\r\nshared but few favours which the new Government had to bestow, and it\r\nwas seldom indeed that any resident of what was termed the old colony\r\nobtained any office of distinction in the Provisional Government, or\r\nacquired any influence in its councils.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThis seems a melancholy termination of the Government of the\r\nPilgrims--a princely race of men, who voluntarily braved the sufferings\r\nof a double exile for the sake of what they believed to be the truth and\r\nthe glory of God; whose courage never failed, nor their loyalty wavered\r\namidst all their privations and hardships; who came to America to enjoy\r\nreligious liberty and promote the honour of England, not to establish\r\npolitical independence, and granted that liberty to others which they\r\nearned and had suffered so much to enjoy themselves; who were honourable\r\nand faithful to their treaty engagements with the aborigines as they\r\nwere in their communications with the Throne; who never betrayed a\r\nfriend or fled from an enemy; who left imperishable footprints of their\r\npiety and industry, as well as of their love of liberty and law, though\r\ntheir self-originated and self-sustained polity perished at length, by\r\nroyal forgetfulness and credulity, to the plausible representations and\r\nambitious avarice of their ever aggressive Massachusetts Puritan\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nWhile the last act of the Pilgrims before leaving the _Mayflower_, in\r\nthe harbour of Cape Cod, was to enter into a compact of local\r\nself-government for common protection and interests, and their first act\r\non landing at New Plymouth was, on bended knees, to commend themselves\r\nand their settlement to the Divine protection and blessing, it is a\r\ntouching fact that the last official act of the General Assembly of the\r\ncolony was to appoint a day of solemn fasting and humiliation on the\r\nextinction of their separate government and their absorption into that\r\nof Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nIt was among the sons and daughters of the Plymouth colony that almost\r\nthe only loyalty in New England during the American Revolution of the\r\nfollowing century was found. Most of the descendants of Edward Winslow,\r\nand of his more distinguished son, Josiah Winslow, were loyalists during\r\nthat revolution.[18] In the councils of the mother country, the merits\r\nof the posterity of the Pilgrims have been acknowledged; as in her\r\nservice some of them, by their talents and courage, have won their way\r\nto eminence. Among the proudest names in the British navy are the\r\ndescendants of the original purchaser of Mattapoisett, in Swansey\r\n(William Brenton, afterwards Governor of Rhode Island);[19] to the\r\ndistinguished title of one of the English peerage is attached the name\r\nof one of the early settlers of Scituate, in the Plymouth colony\r\n(William Vassall, who settled there in 1635.)[20]\r\n\r\n\"In one respect,\" says Moore, \"the people of the Old Colony present a\r\nremarkable exception to the rest of America. They are the purest English\r\nrace in the world; there is scarcely an intermixture even with the\r\nScotch or Irish, and none with the aboriginals. Almost all the present\r\npopulation are descended from the original English settlers. Many of\r\nthem still own the lands which their early ancestors rescued from the\r\nwilderness; and although they have spread themselves in every direction\r\nthrough this wide continent, from the peninsula of Nova Scotia to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, some one of the family has generally remained to\r\ncultivate the soil which was owned by his ancestors. The fishermen and\r\nthe navigators of Maine, the children of Plymouth, still continue the\r\nindustrious and bold pursuits of their forefathers. In that fine\r\ncountry, beginning at Utica, in the State of New York, and stretching to\r\nLake Erie, this race may be found on every hill and in every valley, on\r\nthe rivers and on the lakes. The emigrant from the sandbanks of Cape Cod\r\nrevels in the profusion of the opulence of Ohio. In all the Southern and\r\nSouth-Western States, the natives of the \"Old Colony,\" like the\r\nArminians of Asia, may be found in every place where commerce and\r\ntraffic offer any lure to enterprise; and in the heart of the peninsula\r\nof Michigan, like their ancestors they have commenced the cultivation of\r\nthe wilderness--like them originally, with savage hearts and savage men,\r\nand like them patient in suffering, despising danger, and animated with\r\nhope.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"The term PILGRIMS belongs exclusively to the Plymouth\r\ncolonists.\" (Young's Chronicles of the Pilgrims, p. 88, note.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The only exception was by Prence, when elected Governor in\r\n1657.

The persecution was short\r\nand never unto death, as among the Boston Puritans.

In Massachusetts it had no competitor; it\r\ndeveloped its principles and spirit without restraint; it was absolute\r\nin power from 1629 to 1689, and during that sixty years it assumed\r\nindependence of the Government to which it owed its corporate existence;\r\nit made it a penal crime for any emigrant to appeal to England against a\r\nlocal decision of Courts or of Government; it permitted no oath of\r\nallegiance to the King, nor the administration of the laws in his name;\r\nit allowed no elective franchise to any Episcopalian, Presbyterian,\r\nBaptist, Quaker, or Papist. Every non-member of the Congregational\r\nChurches was compelled to pay taxes and bear all other Puritan burdens,\r\nbut was allowed no representation by franchise, much less by eligibility\r\nfor any office.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the \"_Pilgrim_ Fathers\" commenced their settlement\r\nat New Plymouth in 1620--nine years before the \"_Puritan_ Fathers\"\r\ncommenced their settlement on the opposite side of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nmaking Boston their ultimate seat of government. The Pilgrim Fathers and\r\ntheir descendants were professedly congregational separatists from the\r\nChurch of England; they had fled by stealth, under severe sufferings,\r\nfrom persecution in England to Holland, where they had resided eleven\r\nyears and upwards, and where they had learned the principles of\r\nreligious toleration and liberty--the fruit of Dutch Arminian advocacy\r\nand suffering. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Company emigrated\r\ndirectly from England, on leaving which they professed to be members of\r\nthe Church of England; their emigration commenced in 1628, the very year\r\nthat Charles the First, having quarrelled with and dissolved the last of\r\nthree Parliaments in less than four years, commenced his eleven years'\r\nrule without a Parliament. During that eleven years a constant current\r\nof emigration flowed from England to Massachusetts Bay, to the extent of\r\n13,000, including no less than seventy clergymen of the Church of\r\nEngland, and many men of rank, and wealth to the amount of some\r\n£300,000. All these emigrants, or \"adventurers,\" as they were called,\r\nleft England with a stinging sense of royal and episcopal despotism, and\r\nwith a corresponding hatred of royalty and episcopacy, but with no\r\nconception of the principles of religious toleration or liberty beyond\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years' interval between the settlement of the Pilgrims\r\nat New Plymouth to that of the Puritans at Salem and Boston, trade had\r\nlargely increased between England and Massachusetts Bay,[22] and the\r\nclimate, fisheries, furs, timber, and other resources of northern New\r\nEngland became well known, and objects of much interest in England.\r\n\r\nKing James had divided all that part of North America, 34° and 45° of\r\nNorth latitude, into two grand divisions, bestowing the southern part\r\nupon a London Company, and the northern part upon a Company formed in\r\nPlymouth and Bristol. The Northern Company resolved to strengthen their\r\ninterests by obtaining a fresh grant from the King. A new patent was\r\nissued reorganizing the Company as the Council for the Affairs of New\r\nEngland, the corporate power of which was to reside at Plymouth, west of\r\nEngland, under the title of the \"Grand Council of Plymouth,\" with a\r\ngrant of three hundred square miles in New England. The Company formed\r\nprojects on too large a scale, and did not succeed; but sold that\r\nportion of its territory which constituted the first settlements of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Company to some merchants in the west of England, who\r\nhad successfully fished for cod and bartered for furs in the region of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, and who thought that a plantation might be formed\r\nthere. Among the most active encouragers of this enterprise was the Rev.\r\nJohn White, a clergyman of Dorchester, a maritime town, which had been\r\nthe source of much commercial adventure in America.[23] One special\r\nobject of Mr. White was to provide an asylum for the ministers who had\r\nbeen deprived and silenced in England for nonconformity to the canons\r\nand ceremonies imposed by Laud and his associates. Through Mr. White the\r\nguarantees became acquainted with several persons of his religious\r\nsympathies in London, who first associated with them, and afterwards\r\nbought rights in their patent. Among these was Matthew Cradock, the\r\nlargest stockholder in the Company, who was appointed its first\r\npresident, with eighteen associates, including John Winthrop, Isaac\r\nJohnson, Sir Richard Saltonstall, and other persons of \"like quality.\"\r\nThe chief object of these gentlemen in promoting a settlement in New\r\nEngland was to provide a retreat where their co-religionists of the\r\nChurch of England could enjoy liberty in matters of religious worship\r\nand discipline. But the proposed undertaking could not be prosecuted\r\nwith success without large means; in order to secure subscriptions for\r\nwhich the commercial aspect of it had to be prominently presented.\r\n\r\nThe religious aspect of the enterprise was presented under the idea of\r\nconnecting and civilizing the idolatrous and savage Indian tribes of New\r\nEngland. There was no hint, and I think no intention, of abolishing and\r\nproscribing the worship of the Church of England in New England; for Mr.\r\nWhite himself, the projector and animating spirit of the whole\r\nenterprise, was a conformist clergyman.[24] It was professedly a\r\nreligio-commercial undertaking, and combined for its support and\r\nadvancement the motives of religion and commerce, together with the\r\nenlargement of the Empire.\r\n\r\nFor greater security and more imposing dignity, the \"adventurers\"\r\ndetermined to apply for a Royal Charter of incorporation. Their\r\napplication was seconded by Lord Dorchester and others near the Throne;\r\nand Charles the First, impressed with the novel idea of at once\r\nextending religion, commerce, and his Empire, granted a Royal Patent\r\nincorporating the Company under the name of \"The Governor and Company of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, in New England.\" But several months before the Royal\r\nCharter was obtained, or even application for it made, Endicot, one of\r\nthe stockholders, was sent out with a ship of one hundred emigrants,\r\nand, in consequence of his favourable report, application was made for a\r\nRoyal Charter.[25]\r\n\r\nIt was the conduct of Endicot, a few months after his arrival at\r\nMassachusetts Bay--first condemned and afterwards sustained and\r\njustified by the Directors of the Corporation in London--that laid the\r\nfoundation of the future Church history of New England, and of its\r\ndisputes with the mother country. Endicot and his one hundred emigrant\r\nadventurers arrived in the summer of 1628, and selected Naumkeag, which\r\nthey called Salem, as their place of settlement, the 6th of September.\r\nEndicot was sent, with his company, by the Council for New England, \"to\r\nsupersede Roger Conant at Naumkeag as local manager.\"[26] \"The colony,\r\nmade up of two sources, consisted of not much above fifty or sixty\r\npersons, none of whom were of special importance except Endicot, who was\r\ndestined to act for nearly forty years a conspicuous part in New England\r\nhistory.\"[27] The Royal Charter passed the seals the 4th of March, 1629,\r\nwith Mr. Cradock as the first Governor of the Company. \"The first step\r\nof the new Corporation was to organize a government for its colony. It\r\ndetermined to place the local administration in the hands of thirteen\r\ncouncillors, to retain their office for one year. Of these, seven,\r\nbesides the Governor (in which office Endicot was continued), were to be\r\nappointed by the Company at home; these eight were to choose three\r\nothers; and the whole number was to be made up by the addition of such\r\nas should be designated by the persons on the spot at the time of\r\nEndicot's arrival, described as \"old planters.\"[28] A second embarkation\r\nof planters and servants was ordered by the Company at a meeting, April\r\n30, 1629, shortly after its incorporation by Royal Charter. Five ships\r\nwere provided for this embarkation; and four ministers were\r\nprovided--Francis Higginson, Samuel Skelton, Francis Bright, and Ralph\r\nSmith.[29] Mr. Higginson says in his journal that he sailed from the\r\nIsle of Wight the 11th of May, and arrived at Cape Ann the 27th of June,\r\nand at Naumkeag (Salem) the 29th. They found at Naumkeag about one\r\nhundred planters and houses, besides a fair house built for Mr. Endicot.\r\nThe old and new planters together were about three hundred, of whom one\r\nhundred removed to Charlestown, where there was a house built; the rest\r\nremained at Salem.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Endicot had corresponded with the settlers at Plymouth, who\r\nsatisfied him that they were right in their judgments of the outward\r\nform of worship, being much like that of the Reformed Churches of\r\nFrance, &c. On the 20th of July, Mr. Higginson and Mr. Skelton, after\r\nfasting and prayer, were first elected by the Company for their\r\nministers--the first, teacher; the other, pastor. Each of them, together\r\nwith three or four grave members, lay their hands on each and either,\r\nwith solemn prayer. Nothing is said of any Church being formed; but on\r\nthe 6th of August, the day appointed for the choice and ordination of\r\nelders and deacons, thirty persons entered into a covenant in writing,\r\nwhich is said to be the beginning of the Church, and that the ministers\r\nwere ordained or instituted anew. The repetition of this form they\r\nprobably thought necessary, because the people were not in a Church\r\nstate before. It is difficult to assign any other reason. Messengers or\r\ndelegates from the Church of Plymouth were expected to join with them,\r\nbut contrary winds hindered them, so that they did not arrive until the\r\nafternoon, but time enough to give the right hand of fellowship.\r\n\r\n\"Two of the company, John and Samuel Brown, one a lawyer, the other a\r\nmerchant, both men of good estates, and of the first patentees of the\r\nCouncil, were dissatisfied. They did not like that the Common Prayer and\r\nservice of the Church of England should be wholly laid aside, and\r\ntherefore drew off, with as many as were of their sentiments, from the\r\nrest, and set up a separate society. This offended the Governor, who\r\ncaused the two members of his Council to be brought before him; and\r\njudging that this practice, together with some speeches they had\r\nuttered, tended to sedition, he sent them back to England. The heads of\r\nthe party being removed, the opposition ceased.\"[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION INVOLVING THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, THE\r\nSETTING UP OF A NEW FORM OF WORSHIP, AND ABOLISHING AND PROSCRIBING THAT\r\nOF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND; THE FACTS ANALYZED AND DISCUSSED; INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAND OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE ORDERED BY THE LONDON COMPANY AND DISREGARDED BY\r\nTHE GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the whole question of the future Church-state in Massachusetts, and\r\nthe future relations of the colony to England, is involved in and\r\nresulted from this proceeding, it is necessary to examine it thoroughly\r\nin relation both to the state of things in the mother country and in the\r\ncolony, as well as the provisions of the Royal Charter. To do this,\r\nseveral things are to be considered: 1. With what views was the Royal\r\nCharter granted, and with what professed views did the first Governor\r\nand his associates leave England under the provisions of the Charter,\r\nand carrying it with them to Massachusetts Bay? 2. What were the\r\nprovisions of the Charter itself on the subject of religion? 3. What\r\nwere the powers claimed and exercised under it by the Massachusetts\r\nPuritans? 4. How far the proceedings of the Massachusetts Puritans were\r\nconsistent with their original professions, with good faith towards the\r\nMother Country, and with the principles of civil and religious liberty\r\nin the colony?\r\n\r\nA careful recollection of the collateral events in England and those of\r\nthe colony, at the time and after granting the Royal Charter, is\r\nrequisite to a correct understanding of the question, and for the\r\nrefutation of those statements by which it was misrepresented and\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n1. The first question is, with what views was the Royal Charter granted,\r\nand with what professed views did the Governor and his associates leave\r\nEngland under the provisions of the Charter, and carrying it with them\r\nto Massachusetts Bay?\r\n\r\nThe theory of some New England historians is, that Puritanism in England\r\nwas opposed to the Church of England, and especially to its Episcopal\r\ngovernment--a theory true as respects the Puritanism of the Long\r\nParliament after the second year of its existence, and of the\r\nCommonwealth and Cromwell, but which is entirely at variance with facts\r\nin respect to the Puritanism professed in England at the time of\r\ngranting the Royal Charter to the Massachusetts Company in 1620, and for\r\ntwelve years afterwards. In the Millenary Petition presented by the\r\nPuritan party in the Church to James the First, on his coming to the\r\nthrone, presbytery was expressly disclaimed; and in the first three\r\nParliaments of Charles the First, during which all the grievances\r\ncomplained of by the Puritans were stated and discussed in the Commons,\r\nnot the slightest objection was made to Episcopacy, but, on the\r\ncontrary, reverence and fidelity in regard to it was professed without\r\nexception; and when the Long Parliament first met, eleven years after\r\nthe granting of the Royal Charter to the Massachusetts Bay Company,\r\nevery member but one professed to be an Episcopalian, and the Holy\r\nCommunion, according to the order of the Church, was, by an unanimous\r\nvote of the Commons, ordered to be partaken by each member. In all the\r\nChurch, as well as judicial and political, reforms of this Parliament\r\nduring its first session, Episcopacy was regarded and treated as\r\ninviolate; and it was not until the following year, under the promptings\r\nof the Scotch Commissioners, that the \"root and branch\" petition was\r\npresented to Parliament against Episcopacy and the Prayer Book, and the\r\nsubject was discussed in the Commons. The theory, therefore, that\r\nPuritanism in England was hostile to the Church at the period in\r\nquestion is contradicted by all the \"collateral\" facts of English\r\nhistory, as it is at variance with the professions of the first\r\nMassachusetts Puritans themselves at the time of their leaving England.\r\n\r\nThis is true in respect to Endicot himself, who was appointed manager of\r\nthe New England Company, to succeed Roger Conant, and in charge of one\r\nhundred \"adventurers\" who reached Naumkeag (which they called Salem) in\r\nSeptember, 1628--seven months before the Royal Charter granted by\r\nCharles the First passed the seals. Within two months after the Royal\r\nCharter was granted, another more numerous party of \"adventurers\"\r\nembarked for New England, and among these two gentlemen, original\r\npatentees and members of the Council--John and Samuel Brown, and four\r\nministers--Higginson, Skelton, Bright, and Smith. During the winter of\r\n1628-9 much sickness prevailed among the emigrants who accompanied\r\nEndicot, who sent for a physician to the Plymouth settlement of the\r\nPilgrim Fathers. A Doctor Fuller was sent, who, while he prescribed\r\nmedicine for the sick of the newly-arrived emigrants, converted Endicot\r\nfrom Episcopalianism to Congregationalism--at least from being a\r\nprofessed Churchman to being an avowed Congregationalist. This is\r\ndistinctly stated by all the historians of the times.[31]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore clear that Endicot had imbibed new views of Church\r\ngovernment and form of worship, and that he determined not to perpetuate\r\nthe worship of the Church of England, to which he had professed to\r\nbelong when he left England, but to form a new Church and a new form of\r\nworship. He seems to have brought over some thirty of the new emigrants\r\nto his new scheme; and among these were the newly-arrived ministers,\r\nHigginson and Skelton. They were both clergymen of the Puritan\r\nschool--professing loyalty to the Church, but refusing to conform to the\r\nnovel ceremonies imposed by Laud and his party.[32] But within two\r\nmonths after their arrival, they entered into the new views of Endicot\r\nto found a new Church on the Congregational system. Their manner of\r\nproceeding to do so has been stated above (p. 29.) Mr. Hutchinson\r\nremarks--\"The New England Puritans, when at full liberty, went the full\r\nlength which the Separatists did in England. It does not follow that\r\nthey would have done so if they had remained in England. In their form\r\nof worship they universally followed the New Plymouth Church.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe question is naturally suggested, could King Charles the First, in\r\ngranting the Charter, one declared object of which was converting the\r\nIndians, have intended or contemplated the superseding the Church for\r\nwhose episcopacy he perished on the scaffold, by the establishment of\r\nCongregationalism in New England? The supposition is absurd, and it is\r\nequally unreasonable to suppose that those who applied for and obtained\r\nthe Charter contemplated anything of the kind, as will appear presently.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be conceived that even among the newly-arrived emigrants\r\non the shores of Massachusetts, such a revolution as the adoption of a\r\nnew form of worship could be accomplished without doing violence to the\r\nconvictions and endeared associations of some parties. However they\r\nmight have objected to the ceremonies and despotic acts of the Laudian\r\nschool in England, they could not, without a pang and voice of\r\nremonstrance, renounce the worship which had given to England her\r\nProtestantism and her liberties, or repudiate the book which embodied\r\nthat form of worship, and which was associated with all that had exalted\r\nEngland, from Cramner and Ridley to their own day. Congregationalism\r\nhad done nothing for the Protestantism or liberties of England, and it\r\nwould have been strange indeed had there not been some among the\r\nemigrants who would not consider their change of latitude and longitude\r\nas destroying their Church membership, and sundering the additional ties\r\nwhich connected them with their forefathers and the associations of all\r\ntheir past life. Endicot, therefore, with all his authority as local\r\nGovernor, and all his energy and zeal, and canvassing among the two or\r\nthree hundred new emigrants for a new Church, had not been able to get\r\nmore than thirty of them, with the aid of the two newly-arrived\r\nministers, to unite in the new Covenant Confession; but he had got the\r\n(if not coerced) majority of the local Councillors to join with him, and\r\ntherefore exercised absolute power over the little community, and\r\ndenounced and treated as mutinous and factious all who would not\r\nrenounce the Church of their fathers and of their own profession down to\r\nthat hour, and adopt the worship of his new community.\r\n\r\nAs only thirty joined with Endicot in the creation of his new Church\r\norganization and Covenant, it is obvious that a majority of the\r\nemigrants either stood aloof from or were opposed to this extraordinary\r\nproceeding. Among the most noted of these adherents to the old Church of\r\nthe Reformation were two brothers, John and Samuel Brown, who refused to\r\nbe parties to this new and locally-devised Church revolution, and\r\nresolved, for themselves, families, and such as thought with them, to\r\ncontinue to worship God according to the custom of their fathers and\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of several American historians, as well as their\r\nechoes in England, to employ epithets of contumely in regard to those\r\nmen, the Browns--both of them men of wealth--the one a lawyer and the\r\nother a private gentleman--both of them much superior to Endicot himself\r\nin social position in England--both of them among the original patentees\r\nand first founders of the colony--both of them Church reformers, but\r\nneither of them a Church revolutionist. It is not worthy of Dr. Palfrey\r\nand Mr. Bancroft to employ the words \"faction\" and \"factionists\" to the\r\nprotests of John and Samuel Brown.[34]\r\n\r\nWhat is stated by Dr. Palfrey and Mr. Bancroft more than refutes and\r\ncondemns the opprobrious epithets they apply to the Browns. On pages 29\r\nand 30 I have given, in the words of Mr. Hutchinson, the account of the\r\nformation of the new Church, and the expulsion of the Browns for their\r\nrefusal to conform to it. Dr. Palfrey states the transaction between\r\nEndicot and the Browns in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The transaction which determined the religious constitution of New\r\nEngland gave offence to two of the Councillors, John and Samuel Brown.\r\nConsidering the late proceedings, _as well they might do_, to amount to\r\na _secession from the national Establishment_, they, with some others of\r\nthe same mind, set up a separate worship, conducted according to the\r\nBook of Common Prayer. Endicot and his friends were in no mood to\r\ntolerate this schism. The brothers, brought before the Governor, said\r\nthat the ministers 'were Separatists, and would be Anabaptists.' The\r\nministers replied that 'they came away from the Common Prayer and\r\nceremonies, and had suffered much for their nonconformity in their\r\nnative land, and therefore, being placed where they might have their\r\nliberty, they neither could nor would use them, because they judged the\r\nimposition of these things to be sinful corruptions of God's worship.'\r\nThere was no composing such strife, and 'therefore, finding these two\r\nbrothers to be of high spirits, and their speeches and practice tending\r\nto mutiny and faction, the Governor told them that New England was no\r\nplace for such as they, and therefore he sent them both back for England\r\nat the return of the ships the same year.'\"[35]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft says: \"The Church was self-constituted. It did not ask the\r\nassent of the King or recognize him as its head; its officers were set\r\napart and ordained among themselves; it used no Liturgy, and it rejected\r\nunnecessary ceremonies; and reduced the simplicity of Calvin to a still\r\nplainer standard.\" \"There existed even in this little company a few\r\nindividuals to whom the new system was unexpected; and in John and\r\nSamuel Brown they found able leaders. Both were members of the Colonial\r\nCouncil, and they had been favourites of the Corporation in England; and\r\none of them, an experienced and meritorious lawyer, had been a member of\r\nthe Board of Assistants in London. They declared their dissent from the\r\nChurch of Higginson; and at every risk of union and tranquillity, they\r\ninsisted upon the use of the English Liturgy.\" \"Finding it to be a vain\r\nattempt to persuade the Browns to relinquish their resolute opposition,\r\nand _believing_ that their speeches _tended_ to produce _disorder_ and\r\ndangerous feuds, Endicot sent them back to England in the returning\r\nships; and _faction_, deprived of its leaders, died away.\"[36]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from these statements--partial as they are in favour of\r\nEndicot and against the Browns--that Endicot himself was the innovator,\r\nthe Church revolutionist and the would-be founder of a new Church, the\r\nreal schismatic from the old Church, and therefore responsible for any\r\ndiscussions which might arise from his proceedings; while the Browns and\r\ntheir friends were for standing in the old ways and walking in the old\r\npaths, refusing to be of those who were given to change. Mr. Bancroft\r\nsays that \"the _new system_ was _unexpected_\" to them. Mr. Palfrey says\r\nthat \"John and Samuel Brown, considering the late proceedings, _as well\r\nthey might_, to amount to a _secession from the national Establishment_,\r\nthey, with some others of the same mind, set up a separate worship\r\nconducted according to the Book of Common Prayer.\" Or, more properly,\r\nthey _continued_ the worship according to the Book of Common Prayer,\r\nwhich they and their fathers had practised, as well as Endicot and\r\nHigginson themselves up to that day, refusing to leave the old Church of\r\nthe Reformation, and come into a new Church founded by joining of hands\r\nof thirty persons, in a new covenant, walking around the place of the\r\nold town-pump of Salem. Mr. Endicot is sent from England as the manager\r\nof a trading Company, and invested with powers as their local temporary\r\nGovernor, to manage their business and remove persons that might disturb\r\nor interfere with its operations; and he becomes acquainted with a\r\nDoctor Fuller, a deacon of a Congregational Church at New Plymouth, and\r\nimbibes his views; and forthwith sets himself to abolish the old Church,\r\nand found a new one, and proceeds at length to banish as seditious and\r\nmutinous those who would not forsake the old way of worship and follow\r\nhim in his new way of worship.\r\n\r\nSome of the above quoted language of Dr. Palfrey and Mr. Bancroft\r\nimplies improper conduct on the part of the brothers Brown, for which\r\nthey were banished. Even if that were so, their position of unchangeable\r\nloyalty to their post and of good faith to their Company might be\r\npleaded in justification of the strongest language on their part. But\r\nsuch was not the fact; it was their _position_, and not their language\r\nor tempers. Mr. Bancroft himself says, in the American edition of his\r\nHistory, that \"the Browns were banished _because they were Churchmen.\r\nThus was Episcopacy professed in Massachusetts, and thus was it exiled.\r\nThe blessings of the promised land were to be kept for Puritan\r\ndissenters_.\"[37] This statement of Mr. Bancroft is confirmed and the\r\nconduct of Endicot more specifically stated by earlier New England\r\nhistorians. In the \"Ecclesiastical History of Massachusetts,\" reprinted\r\nby the Massachusetts Historical Society, the whole affair is minutely\r\nrelated. The following passages are sufficient for my purpose:\r\n\r\n\"An opposition of some consequence arose from several persons of\r\ninfluence, who had been active in promoting the settlement of the place.\r\nAt the head of this were Mr. Samuel Brown and Mr. John Brown, the one a\r\nlawyer and the other a merchant, who were attached to the form and usage\r\nof the Church of England. The ministers [Higginson and Skelton],\r\nassisted by Mr. Endicot, endeavoured to bring them over to the practice\r\nof the Puritans, but without success.\" \"These gentlemen, with others,\r\nwere conscientious Churchmen, and desired to use the Liturgy, and for\r\nthis purpose met in their own houses. The magistrates, or rather Mr.\r\nEndicot, sent to demand a reason for their separation. They answered,\r\nthat as they were of the Church established by law in their native\r\ncountry, it was highly proper they should worship God as the Government\r\nrequired, from whom they had received their Charter. Surely they might\r\nbe allowed that _liberty of conscience_ which all conceived to be\r\nreasonable when they were on the other side of the water. But these\r\narguments were called _seditious_ and _mutinous_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bentley imputes the errors of the ministers to the temper of\r\nEndicot, who was determined to execute his own plan of Church\r\ngovernment. Inexperienced in the passions of men, and unaccustomed to\r\nconsult even his friends, he was resolved to suffer no opposition; and\r\nas the Salem Church had disdained the authority of the Church of\r\nEngland, his feelings were hurt and his temper raised against those who\r\npreferred a Liturgy, and whose object might be, as he conceived, to\r\ncause a schism in the community.\"[38]\r\n\r\nThe Mr. Bentley referred to above was the historian of the town of\r\nSalem, in a book entitled \"Description and History of Salem, by the Rev.\r\nWilliam Bentley,\" and reprinted in the \"Collection of the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society,\" Vol. VI., pp. 212-277. Referring to Endicot's\r\nconduct to the Browns, Mr. Bentley says:\r\n\r\n\"Endicot had been the cause of all the rash proceedings against the\r\nBrowns. He was determined to execute his own plan of Church government.\r\nInexperienced in the passions of men, and unaccustomed to consult even\r\nhis friends, he was resolved to admit of no opposition. They _who could\r\nnot be terrified into silence_ were _not commanded to withdraw, but they\r\nwere seized and banished as criminals_. The fear of injury to the colony\r\ninduced its friends in England to give private satisfaction, and then to\r\nwrite a reproof to him who had been the cause of the outrages; and\r\nEndicot never recovered his reputation in England.\" (p. 245.)\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear beyond reasonable doubt that the sole offence of the\r\nBrowns, and those who remained with them, was that they adhered to the\r\nworship which they had always practised, and which was professed by all\r\nparties when they left England, and because they refused to follow Mr.\r\nEndicot in the new Church polity and worship which he adopted from the\r\nCongregational Plymouth physician, after his arrival at Salem, and which\r\nhe was determined to establish as the only worship in the new\r\nPlantation. It was Endicot, therefore, that commenced the change, the\r\ninnovation, the schism, and the power given him as Manager of the\r\ntrading business of the Company he exercised for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a Church revolution, and banishing the men who adhered to\r\nthe old ways of worship professed by the Company when applying for the\r\nRoyal Charter, and still professed by them in England. It is not\r\npretended by any party that the Browns were not interested in the\r\nsuccess of the Company as originally established, and as professed when\r\nthey left England; it is not insinuated that they opposed in any way or\r\ndiffered from Endicot in regard to his management of the general affairs\r\nof the Company; on the contrary, it is manifest by the statement of all\r\nparties that the sole ground and question of dispute between Endicot and\r\nthe Browns was the refusal of the latter to abandon the Episcopal and\r\nadopt the Congregational form of worship set up by Endicot and thirty\r\nothers, by joining of hands and subscribing to a covenant and confession\r\nof faith around the well-pump of Naumkeag, then christened Salem.\r\n\r\nThe whole dispute, then, narrowed to this one question, let us inquire\r\nin what manner the Browns and their friends declined acting with Endicot\r\nin establishing a new form of worship instead of that of the Church of\r\nEngland?\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Endicot even consulted his local Council, much\r\nless the Directors of the Company in England, as to his setting up a new\r\nChurch and new form of worship in the new Plantation at Salem. Having\r\nwith the new accession of emigrants received the appointment of\r\nGovernor, he appears to have regarded himself as an independent ruler.\r\nSuddenly raised from being a manager and captain to being a Governor, he\r\nassumed more despotic power than did King Charles in England, and among\r\nthe new emigrants placed under his control, and whom he seems to have\r\nregarded as his subjects--himself their absolute sovereign, in both\r\nChurch and State. In his conferences with Fuller, the Congregational\r\ndoctor from New Plymouth, he found the Congregational worship to answer\r\nto his aspirations as in it he could on the one hand gratify his hatred\r\nof King and Church, and on the other hand become the founder of the new\r\nChurch in a new Plantation. He paused not to consider whether the\r\nmanager of a trading Company of adventurers had any authority to abolish\r\nthe worship professed by the Company under whose authority he was\r\nacting; how far fidelity required him to give effect to the worship of\r\nhis employers in carrying out their instructions in regard to the\r\nreligious instruction of their servants and the natives; but he\r\nforthwith resolved to adopt a new confession of faith and to set up a\r\nnew form of worship. On the arrival of the first three chaplains of the\r\nCompany, in June of 1629, several months after his own arrival, Endicot\r\nseems to have imparted his views to them, and two of them, Higginson and\r\nSkelton, fell in with his scheme; but Mr. Bright adhered to his Church.\r\nIt was not unnatural for Messrs. Higginson and Skelton to prefer\r\nbecoming the fathers and founders of a new Church than to remain\r\nsubordinate ministers of an old Church. The Company, in its written\r\nagreement with them, or rather in its instructions accompanying them to\r\nEndicot, allowed them discretion in their new mission field as to their\r\nmode of teaching and worship; but certainly no authority to ignore it,\r\nmuch less authority to adopt a new confession of faith and a new form of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nWithin three months after the arrival of these chaplains of the Company\r\nat Salem, they and Endicot matured the plan of setting up a new Church,\r\nand seemed to have persuaded thirty-one of the two hundred emigrants to\r\njoin with them--a minority of less than one-sixth of the little\r\ncommunity; but in that minority was the absolute Governor, and against\r\nwhose will a majority was nothing, even in religious matters, or in\r\nliberty of conscience. Government by majorities and liberty of\r\nconscience are attributes of freedom.\r\n\r\nLet it be observed here, once for all, that Endicot and his friends are\r\nnot, in my opinion, censurable for changing their professed religious\r\nopinions and worship and adopting others, if they thought it right to do\r\nso. If, on their arrival at Massachusetts Bay, they thought and felt\r\nthemselves in duty bound to renounce their old and set up a new form of\r\nworship and Church discipline, it was doubtless their right to do so;\r\nbut in doing so it was unquestionably their duty not to violate their\r\nprevious engagements and the rights of others. They were not the\r\noriginal owners and occupants of the country, and were not absolutely\r\nfree to choose their own form of government and worship; they were\r\nBritish subjects, and were commencing the settlement of a territory\r\ngranted them by their Sovereign; they were sent there by a Company\r\nexisting and acting under Royal Charter; Endicot was the chief agent of\r\nthat Company, and acting under their instructions. As such, duty\r\nrequired him to consult his employers before taking the all-important\r\nstep of setting aside the worship they professed and establishing a new\r\none, much less to proscribe and banish those who had adventured as\r\nsettlers upon the old professed worship, and declined adopting the new.\r\nAnd was it not a violation of good faith, as well as liberty of\r\nconscience, to deny to the Browns and their friends the very worship on\r\nthe profession of which by all parties they had embarked as settlers in\r\nNew England? To come to New England as Churchmen, and then abolish the\r\nworship of the Church and set up a new form of worship, without even\r\nconsulting his employers, was what was done by Endicot; and to come as\r\nChurchmen to settle in New England, and then to be banished from it for\r\nbeing Churchmen, was what was done to the Browns by Endicot.\r\n\r\nThis act of despotism and persecution--apart from its relations to the\r\nKing, and the Company chartered by him--is the more reprehensible from\r\nthe manner of its execution and the circumstances connected with it.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the foregoing statements and authorities, that the\r\nBrowns were not only gentlemen of the highest respectability, Puritan\r\nChurchmen, and friends of the colonial enterprise, but that when Endicot\r\nresolved upon founding a new Church and worship, they did not interfere\r\nwith him; they did not interrupt, by objection or discussion, his\r\nproceedings around the well-pump of Salem in organizing a new Church and\r\nin heretofore professing clergymen of the Church of England, and with\r\nits vows upon them, and coming as chaplains of a Church of England\r\nCorporation, submitting to a new ordination in order to exercise\r\necclesiastical functions. The Browns and their friends seem to have been\r\nsilent spectators of these proceedings--doubtless with feelings of\r\nastonishment if not of grief--but determined to worship in their\r\nfamilies and on the Sabbath in their old way. But in this they were\r\ninterrupted, and haled before the new Governor, Endicot, to answer for\r\ntheir not coming to his worship and abandoning that which they and their\r\nfathers, and Endicot himself, had practised; were called \"Separatists,\"\r\nfor not acting as such in regard to their old way of worship; and were\r\ntreated as \"seditious and mutinous,\" for justifying their fidelity to\r\nthe old worship before the new \"Star Chamber\" tribunal of Endicot. The\r\nearly New England ecclesiastical historian above quoted says: \"The\r\nmagistrates, or rather Endicot, _sent to demand a reason_[39] for their\r\nseparation. They _answered_ that as they were of the Church established\r\nby law in their native country, it was highly proper they should worship\r\nGod as the Government required from whom they had received their\r\nCharter. Surely they might be allowed that liberty of conscience which\r\nall conceived to be reasonable when they were on the other side of the\r\nwater.\" But their arguments were called \"seditious and mutinous.\" The\r\nfirst Congregational historian of Salem, above quoted, says: \"Endicot\r\nhad been the cause of all the rash proceedings against the Browns. He\r\nwas determined to execute his plan of Church government. Inexperienced\r\nin the passions of men, and unaccustomed to consult even his friends, he\r\nwas resolved to admit of no opposition. They who could not be terrified\r\ninto silence _were not commanded to withdraw_, but were _seized_ and\r\n_transported as criminals_.\"[40]\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts of the case itself, as related by the New England\r\nPuritan writers themselves. I will now for a short time cross the\r\nAtlantic, and see what were the professions and proceedings of the\r\nCouncil or \"Grand Court\" of the Company in England in regard to the\r\nchief objects of establishing the Plantation, their provision for its\r\nreligious wants, and their judgment afterwards of Endicot's proceedings.\r\nIn the Company's first letter of instructions to Endicot and his\r\nCouncil, dated the 17th of April, 1629, they remind him that the\r\npropagation of the Gospel was the primary object contemplated by them;\r\nthat they had appointed and contracted with three ministers to promote\r\nthat work, and instructed him to provide accommodation and necessaries\r\nfor them, according to agreement. They apprise him also of his\r\nconfirmation as \"Governor of _our_ Plantation,\" and of the names of the\r\nCouncillors joined with him.[41] In their letter to Endicot, they call\r\nthe ministers sent by them \"your ministers,\" and say: \"For the manner of\r\nexercising their ministry, and teaching both our own people and the\r\nIndians, we leave that to themselves, hoping they will make God's Word\r\nthe rule of their actions, and mutually agree in the discharge of their\r\nduties.\" Such instructions and directions have doubtless been given by\r\nthe Managing Boards of many Missionary Societies to missionaries whom\r\nthey sent abroad; but without the least suspicion that such missionaries\r\ncould, in good faith, on arriving at their destination, ignore the\r\nChurch and ordination in connection with which they had been employed,\r\nand set up a new Church, and even be parties to banishing from their new\r\nfield of labour to which they had been sent, the members of the Church\r\nof which they themselves were professed ministers when they received\r\ntheir appointment and stipulated support.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after transmitting to Endicot the letter above referred to,\r\nthe Company addressed to him a second general letter of instructions.\r\nThis letter is dated the 28th of May, 1629, and encloses the official\r\nproceedings of the Council or \"General Court\" appointing Endicot as\r\nGovernor, with the names of the Councillors joined with him, together\r\nwith the form of _oaths_ he and the other local officers of the Company\r\nwere to take.[42] The oath required to be taken by Endicot and each\r\nlocal Governor is very full and explicit.[43] It is also to be observed\r\nthat these two letters of instructions, with forms of oaths and\r\nappointments of his Council, were sent out three months before Endicot,\r\nHigginson, and Skelton proceeded to ignore and abolish the Church\r\nprofessed by the Company and themselves, and set up a new Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Two years after the Plymouth settlement, \"Thirty-five\r\nships sailed this year (1622) from the west of England, and two from\r\nLondon, to fish on the New England coasts, and made profitable voyages.\"\r\n(Holmes' Annals of America, Vol. I., p. 179.) In a note on the same page\r\nit is said: \"Where in Newfoundland they shared six or seven pounds for a\r\ncommon man, in New England they shared fourteen pounds; besides, six\r\nDutch and French ships made wonderful returns in furs.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: \"The Council of New England, on the 19th of March (1627),\r\nsold to Sir Henry Rowsell, Sir John Young, and four other associates,\r\n[Thomas Southwood, John Humphrey, John Endicot, and Simeon Whitcombe,]\r\nin the vicinity of Dorchester, in England, a patent for all that part of\r\nNew England lying between three miles to the northward of Merrimack\r\nRiver, and three miles to the southward of Charles River, and in length\r\nwithin the described breadth from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea.\"\r\n(Holmes' Annals, Vol. I., p. 193.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The zeal of White soon found other powerful associates in\r\nand out of London--kindred spirits, men of religious fervour, uniting\r\nemotions of enthusiasm with unbending perseverance in action--Winthrop,\r\nDudley, Johnson, Pynchon, Eaton, Saltonstall, Bellingham, so famous in\r\ncolonial annals, besides many others, men of fortune and friends to\r\ncolonial enterprise. Three of the original purchasers parted with their\r\nrights; Humphrey and Endicot retained an equal interest with the\r\noriginal purchasers.

(History of the United States, Vol. I., pp.\r\n369, 370.)\r\n\r\n\"When the news reached London of the safe arrival of the emigrants\r\n(under Endicot), the number of the adventurers had already enlarged. The\r\nPuritans throughout England began to take an interest in the efforts\r\nwhich invited the imagination to indulge in delightful visions. Interest\r\nwas also made to obtain a Royal Charter, with the aid of Bellingham and\r\nWhite, an eminent lawyer, who advocated the design. The Earl of Warwick\r\nhad always been a friend to the Company; and Lord Dorchester, then one\r\nof the Secretaries of State, is said to have exerted a powerful\r\ninfluence in behalf of it. At last [March 4th, 1629], after much labour\r\nand large expenditures, the patent for the Company of Massachusetts Bay\r\npassed the seals.\" (_Ib._, p. 379.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The precursor of this Company was a Joint Stock\r\nAssociation, established at Dorchester under the auspices of the Rev.\r\nMr. White, \"patriarch of Dorchester,\" and called the \"Dorchester\r\nAdventurers,\" with a view to fishing, farming, and hunting; but the\r\nundertaking was not successful, and an attempt was made to retrieve\r\naffairs by putting the colony under a different direction. The\r\nDorchester partners heard of some religious and well-affected persons\r\nthat were lately removed out of New Plymouth, out of dislike of their\r\nprinciples of rigid separation, of which Mr. Roger Conant was one--a\r\nreligious, sober, and prudent gentleman. (Hubbard's History of New\r\nEngland, Chap. xviii.) The partners engaged Conant to be their Governor,\r\nwith the charge of all their affairs, as well fishing as planting. The\r\nchange did not produce success. The Association sold its land, shipping,\r\n&c.; and Mr. Endicot was appointed under the new _regime_. (Palfrey's\r\nHist. of New England, Vol. I., pp. 285-8.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Palfrey, Vol. I., p. 289.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Ib._, p. 292.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Mr. Bright, one of these ministers, is said by Hubbard to\r\nhave been a Conformist. He went, soon after his arrival, to Charlestown,\r\nand tarried about a year in the country, when he returned to England.\r\nRalph Smith was required to give a pledge, under his hand, that he would\r\nnot exercise his ministry within the limits of the patent, without the\r\nexpress leave of the Governor on the spot. Mr. Smith seems to have been\r\nof the separation in England, which occasioned the caution to be used\r\nwith him. He was a little while in Nantasket, and went from thence to\r\nPlymouth, where he was their minister for several years.

Thus much is certain--that when Skelton\r\nand Higginson reached Salem, they found Endicot, who was not only their\r\nGovernor, but one of the six considerable men who had made the first\r\nmovement for a patent, fully prepared for the ecclesiastical\r\norganization which was presently instituted. In the month before their\r\narrival, Endicot, in a letter [May 11, 1629] to Bradford thanking him\r\nfor the visit of Fuller, had said: 'I rejoice much that I am by him\r\nsatisfied touching your judgments of the outward form of God's\r\nworship.'--Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, First\r\nSeries, Vol. III., p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Cotton Mather relates that, taking the last look at his\r\nnative shore, Higginson said, 'We will not say, as the Separatists say,\r\n\"Farewell, Babylon; farewell, Rome;\" but we will say, \"Farewell, dear\r\nEngland; farewell, Church of God in England, and all the Christian\r\nfriends there.

It\r\nis worthy of remark, that in the Records of the Company the specific\r\nsubjects of complaint by the Browns are carefully kept out of\r\nsight--only that a \"dispute\" or \"difference\" had arisen between them and\r\n\"Governor Endicot;\" but what that difference was is nowhere mentioned in\r\nthe Records of the Company. The letters of Endicot and the Browns were\r\nput into the hands of Goffe, the Deputy Governor of the Company; were\r\nnever published; and they are said to have been \"missing\" unto this day.\r\nHad the real cause and subject of difference been known in England, and\r\nbeen duly represented to the Privy Council, the Royal Charter would\r\nundoubtedly have been forthwith forfeited and cancelled; but the\r\nPuritan-party feeling of the Browns seems to have been appealed to not\r\nto destroy the Company and their enterprise; that in case of not\r\nprosecuting their complaints before a legal tribunal, the matter would\r\nbe referred to a jointly selected Committee of the Council to arbitrate\r\non the affair; and that in the meantime the conduct of Endicot in making\r\nChurch innovations (if he had made them) would be disclaimed by the\r\nCompany. To render the Browns powerless to sustain their complaints,\r\ntheir letters were seized[44] and their statements were denied.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the rumours and reports from the new Plantation of\r\nMassachusetts produced a strong impression in England, and excited great\r\nalarm among the members and friends of the Company, who adopted three\r\nmethods of securing themselves and their Charter, and of saving the\r\nPlantation from the consequences of Endicot's alleged innovations and\r\nviolent conduct. Firstly--The Governor of the Company, Mr. Cradock,\r\nwrote to Endicot, Higginson, and Skelton, professing doubts of the truth\r\nof the charges made against them--disclaiming and warning them against\r\nthe reported innovations--thus protecting themselves in case of charge\r\nfrom all participation in or responsibility for such proceedings.\r\nSecondly--They positively denied the statements of the Browns as to\r\nEndicot's alleged \"innovations,\" and used every means to depreciate the\r\ntrustworthiness and character of the Browns, notwithstanding their\r\nformer commendation of them and their acknowledged respectability.\r\nThirdly--They prepared and published documents declaring their adherence\r\nto the Church of England, and the calumny of the charges and rumours put\r\nforth against them as being disaffected to it.\r\n\r\n1. Their Governor, Mr. Cradock, wrote to Endicot in the name of the\r\nCompany. This letter, dated October 16, 1629, is given at length in a\r\nnote.[46] It will be seen by this letter how strongly the Company\r\ncondemned the innovations charged against Endicot by the Browns, and how\r\nimperatively they direct him to correct them, while they profess to\r\ndoubt whether he could have been a party to any such proceedings. In\r\nthis letter is also the most explicit testimony by the Company of the\r\nKing's kindness and generosity to them, as well as a statement of the\r\nclear understanding between the King and the Company as to the\r\nintentions and spirit of the Royal Charter, and which the Company in\r\nLondon expressed their determination to observe in good faith--a good\r\nfaith which was invariably and even indulgently observed by both Charles\r\nthe First and Second, but which was as constantly violated by the\r\nGovernment of Massachusetts Bay, as will appear hereafter from the\r\ntransfer of the Charter there in 1630, to the cancelling of the Charter\r\nunder James the Second, in 1687. Endicot, confident in his ability to\r\nprevent the transmission of any evidence to England that could sustain\r\nthe statements of the Browns, paid no heed to the instructions of the\r\nCompany, and persisted in his course of Church revolution and\r\nproscription.\r\n\r\nThe letter addressed to Higginson and Skelton was signed not only by the\r\nGovernor, but by the chief members of the Company, and among others by\r\nJohn Winthrop, who took the Royal Charter to Massachusetts Bay, and\r\nthere, as Governor, administered it by maintaining all that Endicot was\r\nalleged to have done, continued to proscribe the worship of the Church\r\nof England, allowed its members no elective franchise as well as no\r\neligibility for office, and persecuted all who attempted to worship in\r\nany other form than that of the Church of Endicot, Higginson and\r\nSkelton--a course in which he persevered until his energies began to\r\nfail; for Mr. Bancroft says: \"The elder Winthrop had, I believe,\r\nrelented before his death, and, it is said, had become weary of\r\nbanishing heretics; the soul of the younger Winthrop [who withdrew from\r\nthe intolerance of the Massachusetts Puritans, and was elected Governor\r\nof Connecticut] was incapable of harbouring a thought of intolerant\r\ncruelty; but the rugged Dudley was not mellowed by old age.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThe letter addressed to Higginson and Skelton expressed a hope that the\r\nreport made, in England as to their language and proceedings were \"but\r\nshadows,\" but at the same time apprised them of their duty to vindicate\r\ntheir innocency or acknowledge and reform their misdeeds, declaring the\r\nfavour of the Government to their Plantation, and their duty and\r\ndetermination not to abuse the confidence which the State had reposed\r\nin them. This letter is given entire in a note.[50]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more clear, from the letters addressed by the Company\r\nboth to Endicot and the ministers Higginson and Skelton, that\r\nrenunciation of the worship of the Church of England was at variance\r\nwith the intentions and profession of all parties in granting and\r\nreceiving the Royal Charter, and that the only defence set up in England\r\nof Endicot, Higginson, and Skelton was a positive denial that they had\r\ndone so. Dudley himself, Deputy Governor, who went to Massachusetts Bay\r\nin the same fleet of eleven ships with Governor Winthrop, wrote to his\r\npatroness, the Countess of Lincoln, several months after his arrival,\r\nand in his letter, dated March 12, 1630, explicitly denies the existence\r\nof any such changes in their worship as had been alleged; that they had\r\nbecome \"Brownists [that is, Congregationalists] in religion,\" etc., and\r\ndeclaring all such allegations to be \"false and scandalous reports;\"\r\nappealing to their friends in England to \"not easily believe that we are\r\nso soon turned from the profession we so long have made at home in our\r\nnative land;\" declaring that he knew \"no one person who came over with\r\nus last year to be altered in judgment or affection, either in\r\necclesiastical or civil respects, since our coming here;\" acknowledging\r\nthe obligations of himself and friends to the King for the royal\r\nkindness to them, and praying his friends in England to \"give no credit\r\nto such malicious aspersions, but be more ready to answer for us than we\r\nhear they have been.\" Dudley's own words are given in note.[51] The only\r\nescape from the admission of Dudley's statements being utterly untrue is\r\nresort to a quibble which is inconsistent with candour and\r\nhonesty--namely, that the Brownist or Congregational worship had been\r\nadopted by Endicot and his party before the arrival of Dudley; but the\r\nscope and evident design of his letter was to assure the Countess of\r\nLincoln and his friends in England that no new Church worship had been\r\nestablished at Massachusetts Bay, when the reverse must have been known\r\nto Dudley, and when he, in support of the new Brownist or Congregational\r\nworship, became a fierce persecutor, even to old age, of all who would\r\nnot conform to it; for, as Mr. Bancroft says, \"the rugged soul of Dudley\r\nwas not mellowed by old age.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Dudley, in Massachusetts, was denying to his English friends\r\nthe existence of ecclesiastical changes there which all history now\r\ndeclares to have taken place, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester,\" the father\r\nof the whole enterprise--the Rev. John White, a conformist clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England, even under Archbishop Laud--wrote and published a\r\npamphlet called \"The Planters' Plea,\"[52] in which he denied also that\r\nany ecclesiastical changes, as alleged, had taken place in the\r\nMassachusetts Plantation, and denounces the authors of such allegations\r\nin no measured terms. This pamphlet contains a \"Brief Relation of the\r\nOccasion of the Planting of this Colony.\" After referring to the third,\r\nor \"great emigration under Winthrop,\"[53] the author proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"This is an impartial though brief relation of the occasion of planting\r\nthe colony; the particulars whereof, if they could be entertained, were\r\nclear enough to any indifferent judgment, that the suspicious and\r\nscandalous reports raised upon these gentlemen and their friends (as if,\r\nunder the colour of planting a colony, they intended to raise a seminary\r\nof faction and separation), are nothing than the fruits of jealousy of\r\nsome distempered mind or, which is worse, perhaps savour of a desperate\r\nmalicious plot of men ill affected to religion, endeavouring, by casting\r\nthe undertakers into the jealousy of the State, to shut them out of\r\nthose advantages which otherwise they might expect from the countenance\r\nof authority. Such men would be entreated to forbear that base and\r\nunchristian course of traducing persons under these odious names of\r\nSeparatists, and enemies of Church and State, for fear lest their own\r\ntongues fall upon themselves by the justice of His hand who will not\r\nfail to clear the innocency of the just, and to cast back into the bosom\r\nof every slanderer the filth that he rakes up to throw into other men's\r\nfaces. As for men of more indifferent and better minds, they would be\r\nseriously advised to beware of entertaining or admitting, much more\r\ncountenancing and crediting, such uncharitable persons as discover\r\nthemselves by their carriage, and that in this particular to be men ill\r\naffected towards the work itself, if not to religion, at which it aims,\r\nand consequently unlikely to report any truths of such as undertake\r\nit.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThis language is very severe, not to say scurrilous; but it is the style\r\nof all Puritan historians and writers in regard to those who complained\r\nof the Puritan Government of Massachusetts. Not even Messrs. Bancroft\r\nand Palfrey have thought it unworthy of their eloquent pages. But\r\nimputation of motives and character is not argument, is most resorted to\r\nfor want of argument, much less is it a refutation of statements now\r\nuniversally known to be true. The venerable author of this \"Planters'\r\nPlea\" denied in indignant terms that Endicot and his friends had become\r\n\"Separatists\" or \"enemies of the Church\" (he had doubtless been so\r\nassured); the very thing in which Endicot gloried--setting up a\r\n\"Separatist\" worship, forbidding the worship of \"the Church,\" and\r\nbanishing its members who resolved to continue the use of its Prayer\r\nBook, in public or in private.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not all. Not only did the Company, in their letters to\r\nEndicot, Higginson, and Skelton, disdain to forbid anything like\r\nabolishing the Church of England and setting up a new Church, and the\r\nuse of language offensive to their Sovereign and the Established Church;\r\nnot only were there the most positive denials on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic that anything of the kind had been done by Endicot; but on the\r\nappointment of Winthrop to supersede Endicot as Governor, and on his\r\ndeparture with a fleet of eleven ships and three hundred \"Adventurers\"\r\nand \"Planters,\" as they were called, a formal and affectionate address\r\nto their \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of England\" was published\r\nby Winthrop from his ship _Arabella_, disclaiming any acts of some among\r\nthem (evidently alluding to what Endicot had been alleged to have done)\r\nhostile to the Church of England, declaring their obligation and\r\nattachment to it, their prayers for it, and entreating the prayers of\r\nits members for the success of their undertaking. This address is said\r\nto have been written by the Rev. John White, the \"Patriarch of\r\nDorchester,\" and prime mover of the whole Plantation enterprise. It is\r\nan imputation upon the integrity of the author, and upon all parties\r\nconcerned in the address, and absurd in itself, to suppose that the\r\nprayers of the Church in England were solicited with a view to the\r\nabolition of its worship in Massachusetts, and the establishment there\r\nof a \"Separatist\" Church. This address--not to be found in any modern\r\nhistory of the Massachusetts Puritans--speaks for itself, and is given\r\nin a note as originally published.[55] It will be recollected that\r\nWinthrop and the other signers of this address had the Royal Charter\r\nwith them, and now constituted the \"principals\" of the Company, whose\r\nauthority in England now ceased, and was henceforth to be exercised at\r\nMassachusetts Bay. They beg that the \"disaffection or indiscretion\" of\r\nsome of the Company--evidently alluding to what Endicot was reported to\r\nhave done--might not be imputed to \"the principals and body of the\r\nCompany.\" Their words are, addressing their Fathers and Brethren of the\r\nChurch of England: \"And howsoever your charity may have met with some\r\noccasional discouragement through the misreport of our intentions, or\r\nthrough the disaffection or indiscretion of some of us, or rather\r\namongst us (for we are not of those who dream of perfection in this\r\nworld); yet we desire you would look at the _principals and body of_ our\r\n_Company, as those who esteem it an honour to call the Church of\r\nEngland, whence we rise, our dear Mother,\" &c._\r\n\r\nIt is passing strange that any man who respects himself could say, in\r\nthe face of these words and of the whole address, that Mr. Winthrop and\r\nthe \"principals and body of the Company\" did not profess to be members\r\nof the Church of England, and did not assure their \"Fathers and Brethren\r\nin England\" of their intention to remain so, and implore the prayers of\r\ntheir Fathers and Brethren for their success. No darker stigma could be\r\ninflicted upon the character of Winthrop and his Company, than the\r\nassertion that at the very moment of making and publishing these\r\nprofessions in England they intended to extinguish their \"dear Mother\"\r\nin Massachusetts, and banish every one from their Plantation who should\r\nuse her Prayer Book, or worship as the \"dear Mother\" worshipped. Yet\r\nsuch is the theory, or fallacy, of some Puritan writers.\r\n\r\nIt has also been pretended that there was no Church of England in\r\nMassachusetts, and therefore the planters were free to set up what form\r\nof worship they pleased. It may be asked in reply, what makes a Church\r\nbut the presence of members of it? An early Christian writer says that\r\n\"wherever there are two or three believers there is a Church.\" But were\r\nnot Endicot, and Higginson, and Skelton as much members of the Church of\r\nEngland on their arrival at Massachusetts Bay as when they left England?\r\nAnd were not the two latter as much clergymen of the Church of England\r\nwhen they met Endicot at Naumkeag, or Salem, as when they engaged with\r\nthe Company in England to go out as ministers to the new Plantation?\r\nDoes crossing the sea change or annihilate the churchmanship of the\r\nmissionary, or the passenger, or the emigrant? There may not be a place\r\nof worship, or a minister, but there are the members of the Church. Is a\r\nmissionary or agent of a Committee or Board of a particular Church in\r\nLondon, no longer a member of that Church when he reaches the foreign\r\nland to which he is sent because he finds no Church worship there, much\r\nless if he finds members of his own Church already there? Yet such are\r\nthe pretences on which some Puritan writers, and even historians,\r\nattempt to justify the conduct of Endicot, Higginson, and Skelton! But,\r\nbe it remembered, I make no objection to their renouncing their Church,\r\nand establishing for themselves and those who chose to follow them, a\r\nnew Church confession and worship. The points of discussion are: 1. Was\r\nit honest for them to do so without consulting those who employed and\r\nsettled them there, and provided for their religious instruction by\r\nclergymen of the Church of England? 2. Was it right or lawful, and was\r\nit not contrary to the laws of England, for them to abolish the worship\r\nof the Church of England and banish its members from the Plantation, as\r\nsettlers, for continuing to worship according to the Church of England?\r\n3. And can they be justified for denying to their friends in England,\r\nand their friends denying to the public and to the King, on their behalf\r\nand on their authority, what they had done, and what all the world now\r\nknows they had done, at Massachusetts Bay? 4. And finally, was it not a\r\nbreach of faith to their Sovereign, from whom they had received their\r\nCharter, and, as they themselves acknowledged, most kind treatment, to\r\ncommence their settlement by abolishing the established religion which\r\nboth the King and they professed when the Charter was granted, and when\r\nthey left England, and banish from the territory which the King had\r\ngranted them all settlers who would not renounce the form of worship\r\nestablished in England from the Reformation, and adopt a new form of\r\nworship, which was not then lawful in England?\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pages bear witness that I have not taken a sentence from\r\nany writer adverse to the Puritans. I have adhered to their own\r\nstatements in their own words, and as printed in their Records. Their\r\neloquent apologist and defender, Mr. Bancroft, says: \"The Charter\r\nconfers on the colonists the rights of English subjects; it does not\r\nconfer on them new and greater rights. On the contrary, they are\r\nstrictly forbidden to make laws or ordinances repugnant to the laws or\r\nstatutes of the realm of England. The express concession of power to\r\nadminister the oath of supremacy demonstrates that universal toleration\r\nwas not designed; and the freemen of the Corporation, it should be\r\nremembered, were not at that time Separatists. Even Higginson, and\r\nHooker, and Cotton were still ministers of the Church of England.\"[56]\r\n\r\nFrom this accumulation of evidence--which might be greatly increased--I\r\nthink it is as clear as day that the abolition of the worship of the\r\nChurch of England, and the establishment of a new form of worship, and a\r\nnew confession of faith, and a new ordination to the ministry at\r\nMassachusetts Bay in 1629, was a violation of the Charter, an insult to\r\nthe King, and a breach of faith with him, notwithstanding his\r\nacknowledged kindness to them, and a renunciation of all the\r\nprofessions which were made by the Company in England.\r\n\r\nThis was the first seed sown, which germinated for one hundred and\r\nthirty years, and then ripened in the American Revolution; it was the\r\nopening wedge which shivered the transatlantic branches from the parent\r\nstock. It was the consciousness of having abused the Royal confidence\r\nand broken faith with their Sovereign, of having acted contrary to the\r\nlaws and statutes of England, that led the Government of Massachusetts\r\nBay to resist and evade all inquiries into their proceedings--to prevent\r\nall evidence from being transmitted to England as to their proceedings,\r\nand to punish as criminals all who should appeal to England against any\r\nof their proceedings--to claim, in short, independence and immunity from\r\nall responsibility to the Crown for anything that they did or might do.\r\nHad Endicot and his party not done what they knew to be contrary to the\r\nloyal Charter and the laws of England, they would have courted inquiry,\r\nthat the light of their fair and loyal acts might be manifest to all\r\nEngland, in refutation of all statements made against them. Had the\r\nBrowns and their Church friends been permitted to worship after the\r\nmanner of their fathers and of their childhood, while Endicot and his\r\nconverts elected to worship in a new manner, there would have been no\r\ncause of collision, and no spirit of distrust and hostility between the\r\nMassachusetts settlement and the King, any more than there was between\r\neither Charles the First or Second, and the settlements and separate\r\nGovernments of Plymouth, Rhode Island, or Connecticut. But Endicot, in\r\nthe spirit of tyranny and intolerance, would allow no liberty of worship\r\nnot of his own establishment; and to maintain which in the spirit of\r\nproscription and persecution, caused all the disputes with the parent\r\nGovernment and all the persecutions and bloodshed on account of religion\r\nin Massachusetts which its Government inflicted in subsequent years, in\r\ncontradistinction to the Governments of Plymouth, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, and even Maryland.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The Company's Records on the whole affair are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 19, 1629.\r\n\r\n\"At this Court letters[45] were read from Mr. Endicot and others of New\r\nEngland. And whereas a difference hath fallen out betwixt the Governor\r\nthere and John and Samuel Brown; it was agreed by the Court that, for\r\nthe determination of those differences, John and Samuel Brown might\r\nchoose out any three of the Company on their behalf to hear the said\r\ndifferences, the Company choosing as many.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Records of the Company, September 29, 1629:\r\n\r\n\"The next thing taken into consideration was the letters from John and\r\nSamuel Brown to divers of their private friends here in England, whether\r\nthe same should be delivered or detained, and whether they should be\r\nopened and read, or not. And for that it was to be doubted by probable\r\ncircumstances that they had defamed the country of New England, and the\r\nGovernor and Government there, it was thought fit that some of the said\r\nletters should be opened and publicly read, which was done accordingly;\r\nand the rest to remain in the Deputy's house (Goffe's), and the parties\r\nto whom they are directed to have notice; and Mr. Governor and Mr.\r\nDeputy, Mr. Treasurer, and Mr. Wright, or any two of them, are entreated\r\nto be at the opening and reading thereof, to the end that the Company\r\nmay have notice if aught be inserted prejudicial to their Government or\r\nPlantation in New England. And it is also thought fit that none of the\r\nletters from Mr. Samuel Brown shall be delivered, but to be kept for use\r\nagainst him as occasion shall be offered.\" (Young's Chronicles, &c., pp.\r\n91, 92.)\r\n\r\n\"Upon the desire of John and Samuel Brown it is thought fit that they\r\nshould have a copy of the accusation against them, to the end they may\r\nbe better prepared to make answer thereto.\"\r\n\r\nThe accusation against the Browns seems to have been simply for sedition\r\nand seditious speeches--a charge brought by persecutors for religion\r\nagainst the persecuted since the days of our Lord and his Apostles--a\r\ncharge for being the victims of which the Puritans in England had loudly\r\ncomplained in the reigns of James and Charles.\r\n\r\nThere is but one other record of the Company on the affair of Endicot\r\nand the Browns, but the suppression of their letters shows clearly that\r\nthe publication of them would have been damaging to the Company.\r\n\r\nThe intercepting and seizure of private letters, after the example of\r\nthe Company in seizing private letters of the Browns and punishing their\r\nauthors, was reduced to a system by the Government of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nwhose officers were commanded to inspect all letters sent by each vessel\r\nleaving their port, and to seize all suspected letters, which were\r\nopened, and, if found to contain any complaint or statement against the\r\nlocal authorities, were retained and the authors arraigned and punished.\r\nThus the Government and public in England were kept in perfect ignorance\r\nof what was transpiring at Massachusetts Bay, except what the local\r\nGovernment chose to communicate; and aggrieved persons in the\r\nPlantations were deprived of all means of appealing to the higher\r\ntribunals in England, and were condemned and punished for sedition in\r\nattempting to do so. This practice continued (as will be shown\r\nhereafter) until the death of King Charles and the usurpation of the\r\nregicides in England.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Company's Records seems to explain the\r\nmanner in which the further proceedings of the Browns was stayed. In\r\norder to get some compensation for their losses, they seem to have\r\nagreed to the stipulations of the Company. But previous to this meeting\r\nof the Company, their Governor had written to Endicot, Higginson, and\r\nSkelton, in letters dated Oct. 18, 1629. These letters will be found in\r\na note on a subsequent page. The extract from the Company's Records,\r\ndated February 10, 1630, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A writing of grievances of Samuel and John Brown was presented to the\r\nCourt, wherein they desire recompense for loss and damage sustained by\r\nthem in New England; and which this Assembly taking into consideration,\r\ndo think fit upon their submitting to stand to the Company's _final\r\norder for ending all differences between them (which they are to signify\r\nunder their hands)_. Mr. Wright and Mr. Eaton are to hear their\r\ncomplaint, and to set down what they in their judgments shall think\r\nrequisite to be allowed them for their pretended damage sustained, and\r\nso to make a final end with them accordingly.\" (Young's Chronicles, &c.,\r\np. 123.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Note by the compiler of the Records--\"Those letters are\r\nunfortunately missing.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: The Company's letter to the Governor, dated October 16,\r\n1629:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--We have written at this time to Mr. Skelton and Mr. Higginson\r\ntouching the rumours of John and Samuel Brown, spread by them upon their\r\narrival here, concerning some unadvised and scandalous speeches uttered\r\nby them in their public sermons or prayers, so have we thought meet to\r\nadvertise you of what they have reported against you and them,\r\nconcerning some rash innovations[47] begun and practised in the civil\r\nand ecclesiastical government.

Wee conceive much hope that this\r\nremembrance of us, if it be frequent and fervent, will bee a most\r\nprosperous gale in our sailes, and provide such a passage and welcome\r\nfor us from the God of the whole earth, as both we which shall finde it,\r\nand yourselves with the rest of our friends who shall heare of it, shall\r\nbe much enlarged to bring in such daily returns of thanksgivings, as the\r\nspecialties of his Providence and Goodnes may justly challenge at all\r\nour hands.

The very fact that all the letters of\r\nEndicot and the Browns, and of the Puritans who wrote on the subject,\r\naccording to Mr. Bancroft, have been suppressed, affords very strong\r\nground to believe that the Massachusetts Puritans violated the\r\nacknowledged objects of the Charter and the terms of their settlement,\r\nand committed the first breach of faith to their Sovereign, and\r\ninculcated that spirit and commenced that series of acts which resulted\r\nin the dismemberment of the British Empire in America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: The General Assembly of the Province of Maryland passed an\r\nAct in 1649 containing the following provision:\r\n\r\n\"No person whatsoever, in this province, professing to believe in Jesus\r\nChrist, shall from henceforth be anywise troubled or molested for his or\r\nher religion, or in the free exercise thereof, or any way compelled to\r\nthe belief or exercise of any other religion against his or her\r\nconsent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft says: \"Christianity was made the law of the land [in\r\nMaryland], and no preference was given to any sect, and equality in\r\nreligious rights, no less than civil freedom, was assured.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nCONTEST BETWEEN KING CHARLES AND THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY PURITANS, DURING\r\nTEN TEARS, FROM 1630 TO 1640; PROFESSIONS OF THE PURITANS ON LEAVING\r\nENGLAND; THEIR CONDUCT ON ARRIVING AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY; SUPPRESSION OF\r\nPURITAN CORRESPONDENCE; COMPLAINTS TO ENGLAND OF THEIR CHURCH REVOLUTION\r\nAND INTOLERANCE; MEMBERS OF THE NEW CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES ALONE\r\nELECTORS AND ELIGIBLE TO OFFICE; FIVE-SIXTHS OF THE POPULATION\r\nDISFRANCHISED; COMPLAINTS OF THE DISFRANCHISED AND PROSCRIBED TO\r\nENGLAND; SUPPRESSION OF CORRESPONDENCE AND THE DENIAL OF FACTS, AND THE\r\nPROFESSIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MASSACHUSETTS PERSECUTORS OF\r\nEPISCOPALIANS OBTAIN A FAVOURABLE DECISION OF THE KING AND PRIVY\r\nCOUNCIL, AND THEY ARE ENCOURAGED IN THEIR SETTLEMENT AND TRADE; TRANSFER\r\nOF THE CHARTER, PLAIN VIOLATIONS OF IT; RUMOURS OF THE APPOINTMENT OF A\r\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL, AND APPOINTMENT OF A ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY AND\r\nREGULATION; PREPARATION TO RESIST THE APPOINTMENT AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY;\r\nROYAL AND COLONIAL RESTRICTIONS ON EMIGRATION; IT CEASES; COLONIAL\r\nPROPERTY AND TRADE DEPRESSED; REVIEW OF THE TREATMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\nBAY COLONY BY KING CHARLES THE FIRST, AND THEIR PROFESSIONS AND\r\nTREATMENT IN RETURN; THE REAL AUTHORS AND PROMOTERS OF RELIGIOUS\r\nTOLERATION AND LIBERTY IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Puritans in England objected to the ceremonies\r\nenforced by Laud, as \"corrupt and superstitious,\" and many ministers\r\nwere ejected from their benefices for nonconformity to them; but none of\r\nthe nonconformists who refused compliance with such \"corrupt and\r\nsuperstitious\" ceremonies ever professed that the _polity_ and _worship_\r\nof the Church was \"corrupt and superstitious,\" and should therefore be\r\nrenounced, much less abolished, as did Endicot and his party at\r\nMassachusetts Bay, and that twenty years before the death of Charles the\r\nFirst and the usurpation of Cromwell.[58]\r\n\r\nIt might be confidently expected that Mr. Winthrop, after an address of\r\nloyalty and affection to his \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of\r\nEngland,\" from the very ship on which he left his native land, would, on\r\nhis arrival at Massachusetts Bay and assuming its government, have\r\nrectified the wrongs of Endicot and his party, and have secured at least\r\nfreedom of worship to the children of his \"dear Mother.\" But he seems to\r\nhave done nothing of the kind; he seems to have fallen in with the very\r\nproceedings of Endicot which had been disclaimed by him in his address\r\nto his \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of England,\" on embarking at\r\nYarmouth for his new government. American historians are entirely silent\r\non the subject. It is very clear that Mr. Winthrop had correspondence\r\nwith his English friends on these matters, as intimated by Mr. Bancroft\r\nin words quoted on page 59. If this suppressed correspondence were\r\npublished, it would doubtless show how it was that Mr. Winthrop, like\r\nEndicot, and to the astonishment of his Puritan friends in England,\r\nchanged from and suppressed the worship of his \"dear Mother\" Church, on\r\nchanging from one side of the Atlantic to the other. Mr. Hutchinson,\r\nreferring to the address of Governor Winthrop to his \"Fathers and\r\nBrethren of the Church of England,\" to remove suspicions and\r\nmisconstructions, says: \"This paper has occasioned a dispute, whether\r\nthe first settlers in Massachusetts were of the Church of England or\r\nnot. However problematical it may be what they were while they remained\r\nin England, they left no room to doubt after they arrived in\r\nAmerica.\"[59]\r\n\r\nBut though the Editor of Winthrop has suppressed the letters which would\r\nexplain how Mr. Winthrop changed from Episcopalianism to\r\nCongregationalism on his assuming the government of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nwe are at no loss to know the character of his proceedings, since, in\r\nless than a year after his arrival there, the worship of his \"dear\r\nMother\" Church not only continued to be suppressed, but its members were\r\ndeprived of the privilege of even becoming \"freemen\" or electors in the\r\nnew \"Commonwealth,\" as it forthwith begun to call itself, and the\r\nprivileges of citizenship were restricted to members of the new\r\nestablished Congregational Churches; for on May 18th, 1631, the newly\r\norganized Legislature, or \"General Court,\" as it was called, enacted\r\nthat, \"To the end the body of the commons may be preserved of honest and\r\ngood men, it was ordered and agreed that for time to come, no man shall\r\nbe admitted to the freedom of this body politic but such as are members\r\nof some of the churches within the limits of the same.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft, after quoting this extraordinary and unprecedented\r\nenactment, remarks--\"The principle of universal suffrage was the usage\r\nof Virginia; Massachusetts, resting for its defence on its unity and its\r\nenthusiasm, gave all power to the select band of religious votaries,\r\ninto which the avenues could be opened only by the elders [ministers].\r\nThe elective franchise was thus confined to a small proportion of the\r\nwhole population, and the Government rested on an essentially\r\naristocratic foundation. But it was not an aristocracy of wealth; the\r\npolity was a sort of theocracy; the servant of the bondman, if he were a\r\nmember of the Church, might be a freeman of the Company.\"--\"It was the\r\nreign of the Church; it was a commonwealth of the chosen people in\r\ncovenant with God.\"[60]\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the new Congregationalists of Massachusetts were\r\nfar behind the old Episcopalians of Virginia in the first principle of\r\ncivil liberty; for while among the latter the Episcopal Church alone was\r\nthe recognized Church, the elective franchise was not restricted to the\r\nmembers of that Church, but was universal; while in the new Government\r\nof Massachusetts, among the new Puritan Congregationalists, none but a\r\nCongregational Church member could be a citizen elector, and none could\r\nbe a Church member without the consent and recommendation of the\r\nminister; and thus the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Bay, at the very\r\nbeginning, became, in the words of Mr. Bancroft, \"the reign of the\r\nChurch\"--not indeed of the Church of England, but of the new\r\nCongregational Church established by joining of hands and covenant\r\naround the well-pump of Naumkeag--then christened Salem.\r\n\r\nThe New England historians assure us that on the settlement of the\r\nPuritans at Massachusetts Bay, the connection between Church and State\r\nceased. It is true that the connection of the Church of England with the\r\nState ceased there; it is true that there was not, in the English sense\r\nof the phrase, connection between the Church and State there; for there\r\nwas no State but the Church; the \"Commonwealth\" was not the government\r\nof free citizens by universal suffrage, or even of property citizens,\r\nbut was \"the reign of the Church,\" the members of which, according to\r\nMr. Bancroft himself, constituted but \"a small proportion of the whole\r\npopulation\"--this great majority (soon five-sixths) of the population\r\nbeing mere helots, bound to do the work and pay the taxes imposed upon\r\nthem by the \"reigning Church,\" but denied all eligibility to any office\r\nin the \"Commonwealth,\" or even the elective franchise of a citizen! It\r\nwas indeed such a \"connection between Church and State\" as had never\r\nexisted, and has never existed to this day, in any Protestant country.\r\n\"The reign of the Church\"--the small minority over the great majority of\r\nthe \"Commonwealth;\" and this system of \"the reign of the Church\" over\r\nthe State--of the government of a Church minority of one-sixth over a\r\nwhole population of five-sixths--continued for sixty years (as will\r\nhereafter appear), until suppressed by a second Royal Charter, which\r\nplaced all citizens upon equal footing before the law, and in respect to\r\nthe elective franchise. Though the Congregational Puritans of\r\nMassachusetts Bay may have been the fathers of American independence of\r\nEngland, they were far from being the fathers or even precursors of\r\nAmerican liberty. They neither understood nor practised the first\r\nprinciples of civil and religious liberty, or even the rights of British\r\nsubjects as then understood and practised in England itself.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted on all sides, that, according to the express words of the\r\nRoyal Charter, the planter emigrants of Massachusetts Bay should enjoy\r\nall \"the privileges of British subjects,\" and that no law or resolution\r\nshould be enacted there \"contrary to the laws and statutes of England.\"\r\nWas it not, therefore, perfectly natural that members of the Church of\r\nEngland emigrating to Massachusetts Bay, and wishing to continue and\r\nworship as such after their arrival there, should complain to their\r\nSovereign in Council, the supreme authority of the State, that, on their\r\narrival in Massachusetts, they found themselves deprived of the\r\nprivilege of worshipping as they had worshipped in England, and found\r\nthemselves subject to banishment the moment they thus worshipped? And\r\nfurthermore, when, unless they actually joined one of the new\r\nCongregational Churches, first established at Massachusetts Bay, August\r\n6th, 1629, five months after granting the Royal Charter (March 4th,\r\n1629), they could enjoy none of the rights of British subjects, they\r\nmust have been more or less than men had they not complained, and loudly\r\ncomplained, to the highest authority that could redress their\r\ngrievances, of their disappointments, and wrongs as British subjects\r\nemigrating to Massachusetts. And could the King in Council refuse to\r\nlisten to such complaints, and authorize inquiry into their truth or\r\nfalsehood, without violating rights which, even at that period of\r\ndespotic government, were regarded as sacred to even the humblest\r\nBritish subject? And the leading complainants were men of the most\r\nrespectable position in England, and who had investments in New\r\nEngland--not only the Messrs. Brown, but Capt. John Mason and Sir\r\nFerdinand Gorges, who complained that the Massachusetts Company had\r\nencroached upon the territory held by them under Royal Charter--territory\r\nwhich afterwards constituted portions of New Hampshire and Maine. Were\r\nthe King and Privy Council to be precluded from inquiring into such\r\ncomplaints? Yet New England historians assail the complainants for stating\r\ntheir grievances, and the King and Council for listening to them even so\r\nfar as to order an inquiry into them. The petitioners are held up as\r\nslanderers and enemies, and the King and Council represented as acting\r\ntyrannically and as infringing the rights of the Massachusetts Puritans,\r\nand seeking the destruction of their liberties and enterprise even by\r\ninquiring into complaints made. The actual proceedings of the King in\r\nCouncil prove the injustice and falsity of such insinuations and\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nThe pretence set up in Massachusetts was that the authority of the Local\r\nGovernment was _supreme_; that to appeal from it to the King himself was\r\nsedition and treason;[61] and the defence set up in England was that the\r\nallegations were untrue, and that the Massachusetts Corporation was\r\nacting loyally according to the provisions of the Charter and for the\r\ninterests of the King. The account of these proceedings before the\r\nKing's Privy Council is given in a note from Mr. Palfrey himself.[62]\r\n\r\nIn regard to these proceedings, the reader's attention is directed to\r\nthe following facts: 1. The principal charges of the complainants were\r\ndenied--resting to be proved by parties that must be called from that\r\nplace [Massachusetts], which required long, expensive time, \"and were in\r\ndue time further to be inquired into;\" and the Massachusetts Corporation\r\ntook effectual precaution against any documentary evidence being brought\r\nthence, or \"parties\" to come, unless at the expense of their all, even\r\nshould the complainants be able and willing to incur the expense of\r\nbringing them to England. The Privy Council therefore deferred further\r\ninquiry into these matters, and in the meantime gave the accused the\r\nbenefit of the doubt and postponement. 2. The nominal Governor of the\r\nCompany in England, Mr. Cradock, Sir R. Saltonstall, &c., \"appeared\r\nbefore the Committee of Council on the Company's behalf, and _had the\r\naddress or good fortune_ to vindicate their clients,\" &c. This they did\r\nso effectually as to prejudice the King and Council against the\r\ncomplainants, and excite their sympathies in favour of the Company, the\r\nKing saying \"he would have them severely punished who did abuse his\r\nGovernor and Plantations.\" But the question arises, And by what sort of\r\n\"address or good fortune\" were Messrs. Cradock and Company able to\r\nvindicate their clients \"to the King's satisfaction and their complete\r\ntriumph?\" Must it not have been by denying the charges which all the\r\nworld now knows to have been true? Must it not have been by appealing to\r\nthe address of Mr. Winthrop and Company to their \"Fathers and Brethren\r\nof the Church of England,\" declaring their undying attachment to their\r\n\"dear Mother?\" and also by appealing to the letter of Deputy Governor\r\nDudley to the Countess of Lincoln, declaring in 1630 that no such Church\r\ninnovations as had been alleged had taken place at Massachusetts Bay?\r\nMust it not have been by their assuring the King's Council that the\r\nworship of the Church of England had not been abolished in\r\nMassachusetts, much less had anyone been banished thence for continuing\r\nto worship according to the Prayer Book of that Church? Must it not have\r\nbeen by their declaring that they were faithfully and loyally carrying\r\nout the intentions and provisions of the Charter, according to the\r\nstatutes and laws of England? 3. Let it be further observed that the\r\nKing, according to the statements of the very party who was imposing\r\nupon his confidence in their sincerity, that throughout this proceeding\r\nhe evinced the same good-will to the Massachusetts Bay colony that he\r\nhad done from the granting of the Charter, and which they had repeatedly\r\nacknowledged in their communications with each other, as quoted above.\r\nYet the Puritan historians ascribe to Charles jealous hostility to their\r\ncolony from the commencement, and on that ground endeavour to justify\r\nthe deceptive conduct of the Company, both in England and at\r\nMassachusetts Bay. Had Charles or his advisers cherished any hostile\r\nfeelings against the Company, there was now a good opportunity of\r\nshowing it. Had he been disposed to act the despot towards them, he\r\nmight at once, on a less plausible pretext than that now afforded him,\r\nhave cancelled his Charter and taken the affairs of the colony into his\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular concurrence of circumstances, and on which I leave the\r\nreader to make his own comments, that while the representatives of the\r\nCompany were avowing to the King the good faith in which their clients\r\nwere carrying out his Majesty's royal intentions in granting the\r\nCharter, they at that very time were not allowing a single Planter to\r\nworship as the King worshipped, and not one who desired so to worship to\r\nenjoy the privilege of a British subject, either to vote or even to\r\nremain in the colony. As Mr. Bancroft says in the American, but not in\r\nthe English edition of his History, men \"were banished because they were\r\nChurchmen. Thus was Episcopacy first professed in Massachusetts, and\r\nthus was it exiled. The blessings of the promised land were to be kept\r\nfor Puritan dissenters.\"\r\n\r\nBut while the King and Privy Council were showering kindness and offers\r\nof further help, if needed, to advance the Plantation, believing their\r\nstatements \"that things were carried there as was pretended when the\r\npatents were granted,\" complaints could not fail to reach England of the\r\npersecution of members of the Church of England, and of the\r\ndisfranchisement of all Planters who would not join the Congregational\r\nChurch, in spite of the efforts of the dominant party in Massachusetts\r\nto intercept and stifle them; and it at length came to the knowledge of\r\nthe King and Privy Council that the Charter itself had been, as it was\r\nexpressed, \"surreptitiously\" carried from England to Massachusetts, new\r\ncouncillors appointed, and the whole government set up at Massachusetts\r\nBay instead of being administered in England, as had been intended when\r\nthe Charter was granted. This had been kept a profound secret for nearly\r\nfour years; but now came to light in 1634.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended that this transfer of the Charter was lawful, and\r\nwas done in accordance with the legal opinion of an able lawyer, Mr.\r\nJohn White, one of the party to the transfer. I enter not into the legal\r\nquestion; the more important question is, Was it honourable? Was it\r\nloyal? Was it according to the intention of the King in granting it? Was\r\nthere any precedent, and has there ever been one to this day, for such a\r\nproceeding? And when they conceived the idea of transferring the\r\nmanagement of the Company from London to Massachusetts, and Mr. Winthrop\r\nand his friends refused to emigrate except on the condition of such\r\ntransfer of the Charter, did not fairness and duty dictate application\r\nto the King, who granted the Charter, for permission to transfer it as\r\nthe best means of promoting the original objects of it? And is there not\r\nreason to believe that their application would have been successful,\r\nfrom the kind conduct of the King and Privy Council towards them, as\r\nstated above by themselves, when complaints were made against them? Was\r\ntheir proceeding straightforward? Was not the secrecy of it suspicious,\r\nand calculated to excite suspicion, when, after more than three years\r\nof secrecy, the act became known to the King and Privy Council?[63]\r\n\r\nThe complainants against the Company in 1632, who found themselves so\r\ncompletely overmatched before the Privy Council by the denials,\r\nprofessions, and written statements produced by Mr. Cradock, Sir R.\r\nSaltonstall, and others, could not but feel exasperated when they knew\r\nthat their complaints were well-founded; and they doubtless determined\r\nto vindicate the truth and justice of them at the first opportunity.\r\nThat opportunity was not long delayed. The discovery that the Charter\r\nand government of the Company had been secretly transferred from London\r\nto Massachusetts Bay excited suspicion and curiosity; rumours and\r\ncomplaints of the proscriptions and injustice of the Colonial Government\r\nbegan to be whispered on all sides; appeal was again made to the King in\r\nCouncil; and the further inquiry indicated in the proceedings of the\r\nPrivy Council two years before, was decided upon; a Royal Commission was\r\nappointed to inquire into these and all other complaints from the\r\ncolonies, and redress the wrongs if found to exist; the appointment of a\r\nGovernor-General over all the New England colonies, to see justice done\r\nto all parties, was contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe complainants against the conduct of the government of Endicot and\r\nWinthrop are represented by their historians as a few individuals of\r\nmalicious feelings and more than doubtful character; but human nature at\r\nMassachusetts Bay must have been different from itself in all civilized\r\ncountries, could it have been contented or silent when the rights of\r\ncitizenship were denied, as Mr. Bancroft himself says, to \"by far the\r\nlarger proportion of the whole population,\" and confined to the members\r\nof a particular denomination, when the only form of worship then\r\nlegalized in England was proscribed, and its members banished from the\r\nland claimed as the exclusive possession of Puritan dissenters. The most\r\ninquisitorial and vigilant efforts of the Local Government to suppress\r\nthe transmission of information to England, and punish complainants,\r\ncould not prevent the grievances of the proscribed and oppressed being\r\nwafted to England, and commanding attention, and especially in\r\nconnection with the startling fact now first discovered, that the Royal\r\nCharter had been removed from England, and a government under its\r\nauthority set up at Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft ascribes the complaints on these subjects as originating in\r\n\"revenge,\" and calls them \"the clamours of the malignant,\" and as\r\namounting to nothing but \"marriages celebrated by civil magistrates,\"\r\nand \"the system of Colonial Church discipline;\" confined, as he himself\r\nsays elsewhere, \"the elective franchise to a small proportion of the\r\nwhole population,\" and \"established the reign of the [Congregational]\r\nChurch.\" Mr. Bancroft proceeds: \"But the greater apprehensions were\r\nraised by a requisition that the Letters Patent of the Company should be\r\nproduced in England--a requisition to which the emigrants returned no\r\nreply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still more menacing,\" says Mr. Bancroft, \"was the appointment of an\r\narbitrary Special Commission [April 10, 1634] for all the colonies.[64]\r\n\r\n\"The news of this Commission soon reached Boston [Sept. 19, 1634;] and\r\nit was at the same time rumoured that a Governor-General was on his way.\r\nThe intelligence awakened the most intense interest in the whole colony,\r\nand led to the boldest measures. Poor as the new settlements were, six\r\nhundred pounds were raised towards fortifications; 'and the assistants\r\nand the deputies discovered their minds to one another,' and the\r\nfortifications were hastened. All the ministers assembled in Boston\r\n[Jan. 19, 1635]; it marks the age, that their opinions were consulted;\r\nit marks the age still more, that _they unanimously declared against the\r\nreception of a General Governor_. 'We ought,' said the fathers of\r\nIsrael, 'to defend our lawful possessions, if we are able; if not, _to\r\navoid and protract_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe rumour of the appointment of a Governor-General over all the New\r\nEngland colonies was premature; but it served to develop the spirit of\r\nthe ruling Puritans of Massachusetts Bay in their determining to resist\r\nthe appointment of a general officer to which no other British colony\r\nhad, or has, ever objected.[65] The decision in their behalf by the\r\nKing in Council, in regard to the complaints made against them in 1632,\r\ndeserved their gratitude; the assurance in the recorded Minutes of the\r\nPrivy Council, that the King had never intended to impose upon them\r\nthose Church ceremonies which they had objected to in England, and the\r\nliberty of not observing which they went to New England to enjoy, should\r\nhave produced corresponding feelings and conduct on their part. In their\r\nperfect liberty of worship in New England, there was no difference\r\nbetween them and their Sovereign. In the meeting of the Privy Council\r\nwhere the Royal declaration is recorded that liberty of worship, without\r\ninterference or restriction, should be enjoyed by all the settlers in\r\nNew England, Laud (then Bishop of London) is reported as present.\r\nWhatever were the sins of King Charles and Laud in creating by their\r\nceremonies, and then punishing, nonconformists in England, they were not\r\njustly liable to the charge of any such sins in their conduct towards\r\nthe Puritans of New England. Throughout the whole reign of either\r\nCharles the First or Second, there is no act or intimation of their\r\ninterfering, or intending or desiring to interfere, with the worship\r\nwhich the Puritans had chosen, or might choose, in New England. In\r\nPlymouth the Congregational worship was adopted in 1620, and was never\r\nmolested; nor would there have been any interference with its adoption\r\nnine years afterwards at Massachusetts Bay, had the Puritans there gone\r\nno further than their brethren at Plymouth had gone, or their brethren\r\nafterwards in Rhode Island and Connecticut. But the Puritans at\r\nMassachusetts Bay assumed not merely the liberty of worship for\r\nthemselves, but _the liberty of prohibiting any other form of worship,\r\nand of proscribing and banishing all who would not join in their\r\nworship_; that is, doing in Massachusetts what they complained so loudly\r\nof the King and Laud doing in England. This was the cause and subject of\r\nthe whole contest between the Corporation of Massachusetts Bay and the\r\nauthorities in England. If it were intolerance and tyranny for the King\r\nand Laud to impose and enforce one form of worship upon all the people\r\nof England, it was equal intolerance and tyranny for the Government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay to impose and enforce one form of worship there upon\r\nall the inhabitants, and especially when their Charter gave them no\r\nauthority whatever in the matter of Church organization.[66] They went\r\nto New England avowedly for liberty of worship; and on arriving there\r\nthey claimed the right to persecute and to banish or disfranchise all\r\nthose who adhered to the worship of the Church to which they professed\r\nto belong, as did their persecutors when they left England, and which\r\nwas the only Church then tolerated by the laws of England.\r\n\r\nWhen it could no longer be concealed or successfully denied that the\r\nworship of the Church of England had been forbidden at Massachusetts Bay\r\nand its members disfranchised; and when it now came to light that the\r\nCharter had been secretly transferred from England to Massachusetts, and\r\na new Governor and Council appointed to administer it there; and when it\r\nfurther became known that the Governor and Council there had actually\r\nprepared to resist by arms the appointment of a General Governor and\r\nRoyal Commission, and had not only refused to produce the Charter, but\r\nhad (to \"avoid and protract\") not even deigned to acknowledge the Privy\r\nCouncil's letter to produce it, the King was thrown upon the rights of\r\nhis Crown, either to maintain them or to have the Royal authority exiled\r\nfrom a part of his dominions. And when it transpired that a large and\r\nincreasing emigration from England was flowing to the very Plantation\r\nwhere the Church had been abolished and the King's authority set at\r\ndefiance,[67] it became a question of prudence whether such emigration\r\nshould not be restricted; and accordingly a Royal Order in Council was\r\nissued forbidding the conveyance of any persons to New England except\r\nthose who should have a Royal license.\r\n\r\nThis Order has been stigmatized by New England writers as most\r\ntyrannical and oppressive. I do not dispute it; but it was provided for\r\nin the Royal Charter, and the writers who assail King Charles and his\r\nCouncil for such an Act should remember that Cromwell himself and his\r\nRump Parliament passed a similar Act eighteen years later, in 1653, as\r\nwill hereafter appear; and it is a curious coincidence, that the same\r\nyear, 1637, in which the King ordered that no person should be conveyed\r\nto New England without first obtaining a certificate that they had taken\r\nthe oath of allegiance and supremacy, and conformed to the worship of\r\nthe Church of England, the Massachusetts General Court passed an\r\nordinance of a much more stringent character, and interfering with\r\nemigration and settlement, and even private hospitality and business to\r\nan extent not paralleled in Colonial history. It was enacted \"That none\r\nshall entertain a stranger who should arrive with intent to reside, or\r\nshall allow the use of any habitation, without liberty from the Standing\r\nCouncil.\"[68]\r\n\r\nThe Charter having been transferred to Massachusetts, a new Council\r\nappointed to administer it there, and no notice having been taken of the\r\nRoyal order for its production, the Commissioners might have advised the\r\nKing to cancel the Charter forthwith and take into his own hands the\r\ngovernment of the obstreperous colony; but instead of exercising such\r\nauthority towards the colonists, as he was wont to do in less flagrant\r\ncases in England, he consented to come into Court and submit his own\r\nauthority, as well as the acts of the resistant colonists, to judicial\r\ninvestigation and decision. The Grand Council of Plymouth, from which\r\nthe Massachusetts Company had first procured their territory, were\r\ncalled upon to answer by what authority and at whose instigation the\r\nCharter had been conveyed to New England. They disclaimed any\r\nparticipation in or knowledge of the transaction, and forthwith\r\nsurrendered their own patent to the King. In doing so they referred to\r\nthe acts of the new patentees at Massachusetts Bay, \"whereby they did\r\nrend in pieces the foundation of the building, and so framed unto\r\nthemselves both new laws and new conceits of matter of religion, forms\r\nof ecclesiastical and temporal orders of government, and punishing\r\ndivers that would not approve them,\" etc. etc., and expressed their\r\nconviction of the necessity of his Majesty \"taking the whole business\r\ninto his own hands.\"[69]\r\n\r\nAfter this surrender of their Charter by the Grand Council of Plymouth\r\n(England), the Attorney-General Bankes brought a _quo warranto_ in the\r\nCourt of King's Bench against the Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Council\r\nof the Corporation of the Massachusetts Bay, to compel the Company to\r\nanswer to the complaints made against them for having violated the\r\nprovisions of the patent.[70] The patentees residing in England\r\ndisclaiming all responsibility for the acts complained of at\r\nMassachusetts (except Mr. Cradock), and no defence having been made of\r\nthose acts, nor the authors of them appearing either personally or by\r\ncounsel, they stood outlawed, and judgment was entered against the\r\nCompany in the person of Mr. Cradock for the usurpation charged in the\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe Lords Commissioners, in pursuance of this decision of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, sent a peremptory order to the Governor of Massachusetts\r\nBay, to transmit the Charter to England, intimating that, in case of\r\n\"further neglect or contempt,\" \"a strict course would be taken against\r\nthem.\"[71] They were now brought face to face with the sovereign\r\nauthority; the contempt of silence; nor did they think it prudent to\r\nrenew military preparations of resistance, as they had done in 1634;\r\ntheir policy now was to \"avoid and protract,\" by pleading exile,\r\nignorance, innocence, begging pardon and pity, yet denying that they\r\nhad done anything wrong, and insinuating that if their Charter should be\r\ncancelled, their allegiance would be forfeited and they would remove,\r\nwith the greater part of the population, and set up a new government. I\r\nhave not met with this very curious address in any modern history of the\r\nUnited States--only glosses of it. I give it entire in a note.[72] They\r\nprofess a willingness to \"yield all _due_ obedience to their Soveraigne\r\nLord the King's Majesty,\" but that they \"are much grieved, that your\r\nLordships should call in our patent, there being no cause knowne to us,\r\nnor any delinquency or fault of ours expressed in the order sent to us\r\nfor that purpose, our government being according to his Majestie's\r\npatent, and wee not answerable for any defects in other plantations.\r\nThis is that which his Majestie's subjects here doe believe and\r\nprofesse, and thereupon wee are all humble suitors to your Lordships,\r\nthat you will be pleased to take into _further consideration_ our\r\ncondition, and to afford us the _liberty of subjects, that we may know\r\nwhat is laid to our charge_; and have leaive and time to _answer for\r\nourselves before_ we be condemned as a people unworthy of his Majestie's\r\nfavour or protection.\"\r\n\r\nThis profession and these statements are made in presence of the facts\r\nthat three years before the Royal Commissioners had in like manner\r\ndemanded the production of the patent in England, giving the reasons for\r\nit, and the present \"humble suitors to their Lordships\" had \"avoided and\r\nprotracted,\" by not even acknowledging the reception of the order, much\r\nless answering the charges of which they were informed, but rather\r\npreparing military fortifications for resisting a General Governor and\r\nRoyal Commissioners of Inquiry, and \"for regulating the Plantations.\"\r\nYet they profess not to know \"what is laid to their charge,\" and are\r\n\"grieved that their Lordships should now demand the patent,\" as if the\r\nproduction of it had never before been demanded. It will be seen by the\r\nletter of their Lordships, given in a note on p. 77, that they refer to\r\nthis treatment of their former order, and say, in the event of \"further\r\n_neglect and contempt_\" a strict course would be taken against them.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Address profess that the cancelling of their Charter\r\nwould involve the loss of their labours, their removal from\r\nMassachusetts, the exposure of the country to the invasions of the\r\nFrench and Dutch, the forfeiture of their allegiance, and their setting\r\nup a new government. It was a mere pretext that the Plantation becoming\r\na Crown colony, as it would on the cancelling of the Charter, would not\r\nsecure to the planters the protection of the Crown, as in the\r\nneighbouring Plymouth settlement, which had no Royal Charter. They knew\r\nthat, under the protection of the King and laws of England, their\r\nliberties and lives and properties would be equally secure as those of\r\nany other of his Majesty's subjects. They twice repeat the misstatement\r\nthat \"nothing had been laid to their charge,\" and \"no fault found upon\r\nthem;\" they insinuate that they would be causelessly denied the\r\nprotection of British subjects, that their allegiance would be\r\nrenounced, and they with the greater part of the population would\r\nestablish a new government, which would be a dangerous precedent for\r\nother colonies. These denials, professions, insinuations, and threats,\r\nthey call \"opening their griefes,\" and conclude in the following\r\nobsequious, plaintive, and prayerful words:\r\n\r\n\"If in any thing wee have offended his Majesty and your Lordships, wee\r\nhumbly prostrate ourselves at the footstool of supreme authority; let us\r\nbe made the objects of his Majestie's clemency, and not cut off, in our\r\nfirst appeal, from all hope of favour. Thus with our earnest prayers to\r\nthe King of kings for long life and prosperity to his sacred Majesty and\r\nhis Royall family, and for all honour and welfare to your Lordships.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lords Commissioners replied to this Address through Mr. Cradock,\r\npronouncing the jealousies and fears professed in the Address to be\r\ngroundless, stating their intentions to be the regulation of all the\r\nColonies, and to continue to the settlers of Massachusetts Bay the\r\nprivileges of British subjects. They repeated their command upon the\r\nCorporation to transmit the Charter to England, at the same time\r\nauthorising the present Government to continue in office until the\r\nissuing of a new Charter. Mr. Cradock transmitted this letter to the\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts Bay, the General Court of which decided not to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of it, pronouncing it \"unofficial\" (being\r\naddressed to Mr. Cradock, who, though the Governor mentioned in the\r\nCharter, and the largest proprietor, was not now Governor); that the\r\nLords Commissioners could not \"proceed upon it,\" since they could not\r\nprove that it had been delivered to the Governor; and they directed Mr.\r\nCradock's agent not to mention Lords Commissioners' letter when he wrote\r\nto Mr. C.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the whole attention of the King was turned from\r\nMassachusetts to Scotland, his war with which resulted ultimately in the\r\nloss of both his crown and his life.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts stated in this and the preceding chapters, I think\r\nit must be admitted that during the nine years which elapsed between\r\ngranting the first Charter by Charles and the resumption of it by _quo\r\nwarranto_ in the Court of King's Bench, the aggression and the hostility\r\nwas on the side of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay. Their first act\r\nwas one of intolerance, and violation of the laws of England in\r\nabolishing the worship of the Church of England, and banishing its\r\nmembers for adhering to its worship. Their denials of it were an\r\nadmission of the unlawfulness of such acts, as they were also\r\ndishonourable to themselves. Their maxim seems to have been, that the\r\nend sanctified the means--at least so far as the King was concerned; and\r\nthat as they distrusted him, they were exempt from the obligations of\r\nloyalty and truth in their relations to him; that he and his were\r\npredestined reprobates, while they and theirs were the elected saints to\r\nwhom, of right, rule and earth belonged. They were evidently sincere in\r\ntheir belief that they were the eternally elected heirs of God, and as\r\nsuch had a right to all they could command and possess, irrespective of\r\nking or savage. Their brotherhood was for themselves alone--everything\r\nfor themselves and nothing for others; their religion partook more of\r\nMoses than of Christ--more of law than of Gospel--more of hatred than\r\nof love--more of antipathy than of attractiveness--more of severity than\r\nof tenderness. In sentiment and in self-complacent purpose they left\r\nEngland to convert the savage heathen in New England; but for more than\r\ntwelve years after their arrival in Massachusetts they killed many\r\nhundreds of Indians, but converted none, nor established any missions\r\nfor their instruction and conversion.\r\n\r\nThe historians of the United States laud without stint the Puritans of\r\nMassachusetts Bay; and they are entitled to all praise for their\r\nindustry, enterprise, morality, independence. But I question whether\r\nthere are many, if any, Protestants in the United States who would wish\r\nthe views and spirit of those Puritans to prevail there, either in\r\nreligion or civil government--a denial of the liberty of worship to\r\nEpiscopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, or Quakers; a denial of\r\neligibility to office or of elective franchise to any other than members\r\nof the Congregational Churches; compulsory attendance upon\r\nCongregational worship, and the support of that worship by general\r\ntaxation, together with the enforcement of its discipline by civil law\r\nand its officers.\r\n\r\nHad the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay understood the principles and\r\ncherished the spirit of civil and religious liberty, and allowed to the\r\nBrowns and their Episcopalian friends the continued enjoyment of their\r\nold and venerated form of worship, while they themselves embraced and\r\nset up a new form of worship, and not made conformity to it a test of\r\nloyalty and of citizenship in the Plantation, there would have been no\r\nlocal dissensions, no persecutions, no complaints to England, no Royal\r\nCommissions of Inquiry or Regulation, no restraints upon emigration, no\r\njealousies and disputes between England and the colony; the feelings of\r\ncordiality with which Charles granted the Charter and encouraged its\r\nfirst four years' operations, according to the testimony of the Puritans\r\nthemselves, would have developed into pride for the success of the\r\nenterprise, and further countenance and aid to advance it; the religious\r\ntoleration in the new colony would have immensely promoted the cause of\r\nreligious toleration in England; and the American colonies would have\r\nlong since grown up, as Canada and Australia are now growing up, into a\r\nstate of national independence, without war or bloodshed, without a\r\nsingle feeling other than that of filial respect and affection for the\r\nMother Country, without any interruption of trade or commerce--presented\r\nan united Protestant and English nationality, under separate\r\ngovernments, on the great continents of the globe and islands of the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nI know it has been said that, had Episcopal worship been tolerated at\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Laud would have soon planted the hierarchy there,\r\nwith all his ceremonies and intolerance. This objection is mere fancy\r\nand pretence. It is fancy--for the Corporation, and not Laud, was the\r\nchartered authority to provide for religious instruction as well as\r\nsettlement and trade in the new Plantation, as illustrated from the very\r\nfact of the Company having selected and employed the first ministers, as\r\nwell as first Governor and other officers, for the two-fold work of\r\nspreading religion and extending the King's dominions in New England.\r\nThe objection is mere pretence, for it could not have been dread of the\r\nChurch of England, which dictated its abolition and the banishment of\r\nits members, since precisely the same spirit of bigotry, persecution,\r\nand proscription prevailed, not only against Roger Williams, Mrs.\r\nHutchinson and her brother Wright and their friends, but in 1646 against\r\nthe Presbyterians, and in 1656 against the Baptists, as will hereafter\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nTheir iron-bound, shrivelled creed of eternal, exclusive election\r\nproduced an iron-hearted population, whose hand was against every man\r\nnot of their tribal faith and tribal independence; but at the same time\r\nnot embodying in their civil or ecclesiastical polity a single element\r\nof liberty or charity which any free State or Church would at this day\r\nbe willing to adopt or recognize as its distinctive constitution or\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nIt was the utter absence of both the principles and spirit of true civil\r\nand religious liberty in the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay, and in their\r\nbrethren under the Commonwealth and Cromwell in England, that left\r\nNonconformists without a plea for toleration under Charles the Second,\r\nfrom the example of their own party on either side of the Atlantic, and\r\nthat has to this day furnished the most effective argument to opponents\r\nagainst dissenters' pretensions to liberality and liberty, and the\r\nstrongest barrier against their political influence in England. They\r\nwere prostrate and powerless when the liberal Churchmen, guided by the\r\nviews of Chillingworth, Burnet, and Tillotson, under William and Mary,\r\nobtained the first Parliamentary enactment for religious toleration in\r\nEngland. It is to the same influence that religious liberty in England\r\nhas been enlarged from time to time; and, at this day, it is to the\r\nexertions and influence of liberal Churchmen, both in and out of\r\nParliament, more than to any independent influence of Puritan\r\ndissenters, that civil and religious liberty are making gradual and\r\ngreat progress in Great Britain and Ireland--a liberty which, I believe,\r\nwould ere this have been complete but for the prescriptive, intolerant\r\nand persecuting spirit and practice of the Puritans of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: It appears that the cause of dissatisfaction among the\r\nPuritan clergy of the Church, and of the emigration of many of them and\r\nof their lay friends to New England, was not the Prayer Book worship of\r\nthe Church (abolished by Endicot at Massachusetts Bay), but the enforced\r\nreading of the Book of Sports, in connection with \"the rigorous\r\nproceedings to enforce ceremonies;\" for Rushworth, Vol. II., Second\r\nPart, page 460, Anno 1636, quoted by the American antiquarian, Hazard,\r\nVol. I., p. 440, states as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The severe censures in the _Star Chamber_, and the greatness of the\r\nfines and the rigorous proceedings to impose ceremonies, the suspending\r\nand silencing of multitudes of ministers, for not reading in the Church\r\nthe Book of Sports to be exercised on the Lord's Day, caused many of the\r\nnation, both ministers and others, to sell their estates, and set sail\r\nfor New England (a late Plantation in America), where they held a\r\nPlantation by patent from the Crown.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp.\r\n19, 20. It appears, however, that within a month after Mr. Winthrop's\r\narrival at Massachusetts Bay, both he and the Deputy-Governor Dudley\r\njoined the new Endicot and Higginson Church; for Mr. Holmes in his\r\nAnnals says: \"A fleet of 14 sail, with men, women and children, and\r\nprovisions, having been prepared early in the year to make a firm\r\nplantation in New England, 12 of the ships arrived early in July [1630]\r\nat Charlestown. In this fleet came Governor Winthrop, Deputy Governor\r\nDudley, and several other gentlemen of wealth and quality. In this fleet\r\ncame about 840 passengers.\" \"On the 30th of July, a day of solemn prayer\r\nand fasting was kept at Charlestown; when Governor Winthrop, Deputy\r\nGovernor Dudley, and Mr. Wilson first entered into Church covenant; and\r\nnow was laid the foundation of the Church of Charlestown, and the first\r\nChurch in Boston.\" (Vol. I., pp. 202, 203.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: History of the United States, Vol. I., pp. 390, 391.\r\n\r\nReferring to this order, May 18, 1631--not a year after Mr. Winthrop's\r\narrival--Mr. Hutchinson says: \"None may now be a freeman of that Company\r\nunless he be a Church member among them. None have voice in the election\r\nof Governor, or Deputy, or assistants--none are to be magistrates,\r\nofficers, or jurymen, grand or petit, but freemen. The ministers give\r\ntheir votes in all the elections of magistrates.

Dr. Henry M. Dexter, of\r\nBoston. It is a book of intense bitterness against Roger Williams, and\r\nindeed everything English; but his account of the origin and objects of\r\nthe Massachusetts Charter suggests, stronger than language can express,\r\nthe presumption and lawlessness of Endicot's proceedings in establishing\r\na new Church and abolishing an old one; and Dr. Dexter's account of the\r\nremoval of the Charter, and its secrecy, is equally suggestive. It is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Let me here repeat and emphasize that it may be remembered by and by\r\nthat this 'Dorchester Company,' originally founded on the transfer of a\r\nportion of the patent of Gorges, and afterwards enlarged and\r\nre-authorized by the Charter of Charles the First, as the 'Governor and\r\nCompany of Massachusetts Bay,' was in its beginning, and in point of\r\nfact, neither more nor less than a private corporation chartered by the\r\nGovernment for purposes of fishing, real estate improvement, and general\r\ncommerce, for which it was to pay the Crown a fifth part of all precious\r\nmetals which it might unearth. It was then more than this only in the\r\nsame sense as the egg, new-laid, is the full-grown fowl, or the acorn\r\nthe oak. It was not yet a State. It was not, even in the beginning, in\r\nthe ordinary sense, a colony. It was a plantation with a strong\r\nreligious idea behind it, on its way to be a colony and a state. In the\r\n_original intent_, the Governor and General Court, and therefore the\r\nGovernment, _were to be and abide in England_. When, in 1628, Endicot\r\nand his little party had been sent over to Salem, his authority was\r\nexpressly declared to be 'in subordination to the Company here' [that\r\nis, in London]. And it was only when Cradock [the first Governor of the\r\nCompany] found that so many practical difficulties threatened all\r\nproceedings upon that basis, as to make it unlikely that Winthrop, and\r\nSaltonstall, and Johnson, and Dudley, and other men whose co-operation\r\nwas greatly to be desired, would not consent to become partners in the\r\nenterprise unless a radical change were made in that respect, that he\r\nproposed and the Company consented, 'for the advancement of the\r\nPlantation, the inducing and encouraging persons of worth and quality to\r\ntransplant themselves and families thither, and for other weighty\r\nreasons therein contained, to transfer the government of the Plantation\r\nto those that shall inhabit there,' &c. It was even a grave question of\r\nlaw whether, under the terms of the Charter, this transfer were\r\npossible.\" ... \"They took the responsibility--so quietly, however, that\r\nthe Home Government seem to have remained in ignorance of the fact for\r\nmore than four years thereafter.\" (pp. 12, 13.)\r\n\r\nIn a note Dr. Dexter says: \"I might illustrate by the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany, which existed into our time with its original Charter--strongly\r\nresembling that of the Massachusetts Company--and which has always been\r\nrather a corporation for trade charterers in England than a colony of\r\nEngland on American soil.\" (_Ib._, p. 12.)\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the Charter that the original design of it was to\r\nconstitute _a corporation in England_ like that of the East India and\r\nother great Companies, with powers to settle plantations within the\r\nlimits of the territory, under such forms of government and magistracy\r\nas should be fit and necessary. The first step in sending out Mr.\r\nEndicot, and appointing him a Council, and giving him commission,\r\ninstructions, etc., was agreeable to this constitution of the Charter.\r\n(Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 12, 13.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: History of the United States, Vol. I., pp. 439, 440.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: The New England historians represent it as a high act of\r\ntyranny for the King to appoint a Governor-General over the colonies,\r\nand to appoint Commissioners with powers so extensive as those of the\r\nRoyal Commission appointed in 1634. But they forget and ignore the fact\r\nthat nine years afterwards, in 1643, when the Massachusetts and\r\nneighbouring colonies were much more advanced in population and wealth\r\nthan in 1634, the Parliament, which was at war with the King and\r\nassuming all his powers, passed an Ordinance appointing a\r\nGovernor-General and Commissioners, and giving them quite as extensive\r\npowers as the proposed Royal Commission of 1634. This Ordinance will be\r\ngiven entire when I come to speak of the Massachusetts Bay Puritans,\r\nunder the Long Parliament and under Cromwell. It will be seen that the\r\nLong Parliament, and Cromwell himself, assumed larger powers over the\r\nNew England colonies than had King Charles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: \"The Charter was far from conceding to the patentees the\r\nprivilege of freedom of worship.

The General Court of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nin their address to the King's Commissioners in September, 1637,\r\nprofessed to offer \"earnest prayers for long life and prosperity to his\r\nsacred Majesty and his royal family, and all honour and welfare to their\r\nLordships;\" but as soon as there was a prospect of a change, and the\r\npower of the King began to decline and that of Parliament began to\r\nincrease, the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay transferred all their\r\nsympathies and assiduities to the Parliament. In 1641, they sent over\r\nthree agents to evoke interest with the Parliamentary leaders--one\r\nlayman, Mr. Hibbins, and two ministers, Thomas Weld and Hugh Peters, the\r\nlatter of whom was as shrewd and active in trade and speculations as he\r\nwas ardent and violent in the pulpit. He made quite a figure in the\r\ncivil war in England, and was Cromwell's favourite war chaplain. Neither\r\nhe nor Weld ever returned to New England.\r\n\r\nAs the persecution of Puritans ceased in England, emigration to New\r\nEngland ceased; trade became depressed and property greatly depreciated\r\nin value; population became stationary in New England during the whole\r\nParliamentary and Commonwealth rule in England, from 1640 to 1660--more\r\nreturning from New England to England than emigrating thither from\r\nEngland.[73]\r\n\r\nThe first success of this mission of Hugh Peters and his colleagues soon\r\nappeared. By the Royal Charter of 1629, the King encouraged the\r\nMassachusetts Company by remitting all taxes upon the property of the\r\nPlantations for the space of seven years, and all customs and duties\r\nupon their exports and imports, to or from any British port, for the\r\nspace of twenty-one years, except the five per cent. due upon their\r\ngoods and merchandise, according to the ancient trade of merchants; but\r\nthe Massachusetts delegates obtained an ordinance of Parliament, or\r\nrather an order of the House of Commons, complimenting the colony on its\r\nprogress and hopeful prospects, and discharging all the exports of the\r\nnatural products of the colony and all the goods imported into it for\r\nits own use, from the payment of any custom or taxation whatever.[74]\r\n\r\nOn this resolution of the Commons three remarks may be made: 1. As in\r\nall previous communications between the King and the Colony, the House\r\nof Commons termed the colony a \"Plantation,\" and the colonists\r\n\"Planters.\" Two years afterwards the colony of Massachusetts Bay assumed\r\nto itself (without Charter or Act of Parliament) the title and style of\r\n\"a Commonwealth.\" 2. While the House of Commons speaks of the prospects\r\nbeing \"very happy for the propagation of the Gospel in those parts,\" the\r\nMassachusetts colony had not established a single mission or employed a\r\nsingle missionary or teacher for the instruction of the Indians. 3. The\r\nHouse of Commons exempts the colony from payment of all duties on\r\narticles exported from or imported into the colony, _until the House of\r\nCommons shall take further order therein to the contrary_,--clearly\r\nimplying and assuming, as beyond doubt, the right of the House of\r\nCommons to impose or abolish such duties at its pleasure. The colonists\r\nof Massachusetts Bay voted hearty thanks to the House of Commons for\r\nthis resolution, and ordered it to be entered on their public records as\r\na proof to posterity of the gracious favour of Parliament.[75]\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts General Court did not then complain of the Parliament\r\ninvading their Charter privileges, in assuming its right to tax or not\r\ntax their imports and exports; but rebelled against Great Britain a\r\nhundred and thirty years afterwards, because the Parliament asserted and\r\napplied the same principle.\r\n\r\nThe Puritan Court of Massachusetts Bay were not slow in reciprocating\r\nthe kind expressions and acts of the Long Parliament, and identifying\r\nthemselves completely with it against the King. In 1644 they passed an\r\nAct, in which they allowed perfect freedom of opinion, discussion, and\r\naction on the side of Parliament, but none on the side of the King; the\r\none party in the colony could say and act as they pleased (and many of\r\nthem went to England and joined Cromwell's army or got places in public\r\ndepartments); no one of the other party was allowed to give expression\r\nto his opinions, either \"directly or indirectly,\" without being\r\n\"accounted as an offender of a high nature against this Commonwealth,\r\nand to be prosecuted, capitally or otherwise, according to the quality\r\nand degree of his offence.\"[76]\r\n\r\nThe New England historians have represented the acts of Charles the\r\nFirst as arbitrary and tyrannical in inquiring into the affairs of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, and in the appointment of a Governor-General and\r\nCommissioners to investigate all their proceedings and regulate them;\r\nand it might be supposed that the Puritan Parliament in England and the\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts Bay would be at one in regard to local\r\nindependence of the colony of any control or interference on the part of\r\nthe Parent State. But the very year after the House of Commons had\r\nadopted so gracious an order to exempt the exports and imports of the\r\ncolony from all taxation, both Houses of Parliament passed an Act for\r\nthe appointment of a Governor-General and seventeen Commissioners--five\r\nLords and twelve Commoners--with unlimited powers over all the American\r\ncolonies. Among the members of the House of Commons composing this\r\nCommission were Sir Harry Vane and Oliver Cromwell. The title of this\r\nAct, in Hazard, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament: whereby\r\nRobert Earl of Warwick is made Governor-in-Chief and Lord High Admiral\r\nof all those Islands and Plantations inhabited, planted, or belonging to\r\nany of his Majesty the King of England's subjects, within the bounds and\r\nupon the coasts of America, and a Committee appointed to be assisting\r\nunto him, for the better government, strengthening and preservation of\r\nthe said Plantations; but chiefly for the advancement of the true\r\nProtestant religion, and further spreading of the Gospel of Christ[77]\r\namong those that yet remain there, in great and miserable blindness and\r\nignorance.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThis Act places all the affairs of the colonies, with the appointment\r\nof Governors and all other local officers, under the direct control of\r\nParliament, through its general Governor and Commissioners, and shows\r\nbeyond doubt that the Puritans of the Long Parliament held the same\r\nviews with those of Charles the First, and George the Third, and Lord\r\nNorth a century afterwards, as to the authority of the British\r\nParliament over the American colonies. Whether those views were right or\r\nwrong, they were the views of all parties in England from the beginning\r\nfor more than a century, as to the relations between the British\r\nParliament and the colonies. The views on this subject held and\r\nmaintained by the United Empire Loyalists, during the American\r\nRevolution of 1776, were those which had been held by all parties in\r\nEngland, whether Puritans or Churchmen, from the first granting of the\r\nCharter to the Company of Massachusetts Bay in 1629. The assumptions and\r\nstatements of American historians to the contrary on this subject are at\r\nvariance with all the preceding facts of colonial history.[79]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft makes no mention of this important ordinance passed by\r\nboth Houses of the Long Parliament;[80] nor does Hutchinson, or Graham,\r\nor Palfrey. Less sweeping acts of authority over the colonies, by\r\neither of the Charters, are portrayed by these historians with\r\nminuteness and power, if not in terms of exaggeration. The most absolute\r\nand comprehensive authority as to both appointments and trade in the\r\ncolonies ordered by the Long Parliament and Commonwealth are referred to\r\nin brief and vague terms, or not at all noticed, by the historical\r\neulogist of the Massachusetts Bay Puritans,[81] who, while they were\r\nasserting their independence of the royal rule of England, claimed and\r\nexercised absolute rule over individual consciences and religious\r\nliberty in Massachusetts, not only against Episcopalians, but equally\r\nagainst Presbyterians and Baptists; for this very year, says Hutchinson,\r\n\"several persons came from England in 1643, made a muster to set\r\nPresbyterian government under the authority of the Assembly of\r\nWestminster; but the New England Assembly, the General Court, soon put\r\nthem to the rout.\"[82] And in the following year, 1644, these \"Fathers\r\nof American liberty\" adopted measures equally decisive to \"rout\" the\r\nBaptists. The ordinance passed on this subject, the \"13th of the 9th\r\nmonth, 1644,\" commences thus: \"Forasmuch as experience hath plentifully\r\nand often proved that since the first arising of the Anabaptists, about\r\none hundred years since, they have been the incendaries of the\r\nCommonwealths and the infectors of persons in main matters of religion,\r\nand the troubles of churches in all places where they have been, and\r\nthat they who have held the baptizing of infants unlawful, have usually\r\nheld other errors or heresies therewith, though they have (as other\r\nheretics used to do) concealed the same till they spied out a fit\r\nadvantage and opportunity to vent them by way of question or scruple,\"\r\netc.: \"It is ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons within\r\nthis jurisdiction shall either openly condemn _or_ oppose the baptizing\r\nof infants, _or_ go about secretly to seduce others from the approbation\r\nor use thereof, _or_ shall purposely depart the congregation at the\r\nministration of the ordinance, _or_ shall deny the ordinance of\r\nmagistracy, or their lawful right and authority to make war, _or_ to\r\npunish the outward breakers of the first Table, and shall appear to the\r\nCourt to continue therein after the due time and means of conviction,\r\n_shall be sentenced to banishment_.\"[83]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1646, the Presbyterians, not being satisfied with\r\nhaving been \"put to the rout\" in 1643, made a second attempt to\r\nestablish their worship within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts Bay.\r\nMr. Palfrey terms this attempt a \"Presbyterian cabal,\" and calls its\r\nleaders \"conspirators.\" They petitioned the General Court or Legislature\r\nof Massachusetts Bay, and on the rejection of their petition they\r\nproposed to appeal to the Parliament in England. They were persecuted\r\nfor both acts. It was pretended that they were punished, not for\r\npetitioning the local Court, but for the expressions used in their\r\npetition--the same as it had been said seventeen years before, that the\r\nMessrs. Brown were banished, not because they were Episcopalians, but\r\nbecause, when called before Endicot and his councillors, they used\r\noffensive expressions in justification of their conduct in continuing to\r\nworship as they had done in England. In their case, in 1629, the use and\r\nworship of the Prayer Book was forbidden, and the promoters of it\r\nbanished, and their papers seized; in this case, in 1646, the\r\nPresbyterian worship was forbidden, and the promoters of it were\r\nimprisoned and fined, and their papers seized. In both cases the victims\r\nof religious intolerance and civil tyranny were men of the highest\r\nposition and intelligence. The statements of the petitioners in 1646\r\n(the truth of which could not be denied, though the petitioners were\r\npunished for telling it) show the state of bondage and oppression to\r\nwhich all who would not join the Congregational Churches--that is,\r\nfive-sixths of the population--were reduced under this system of Church\r\ngovernment--the Congregational Church members alone electors, alone\r\neligible to be elected, alone law-makers and law administrators, alone\r\nimposing taxes, alone providing military stores and commanding the\r\nsoldiery; and then the victims of such a Government were pronounced and\r\npunished as \"conspirators\" and \"traitors\" when they ventured to appeal\r\nfor redress to the Mother Country. The most exclusive and irresponsible\r\nGovernment that ever existed in Canada in its earliest days never\r\napproached such a despotism as this of Massachusetts Bay. I leave the\r\nreader to decide, when he peruses what was petitioned for--first to the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature, and then to the English Parliament--who were\r\nthe real \"traitors\" and who the \"conspirators\" against right and\r\nliberty: the \"Presbyterian cabal,\" as Mr. Palfrey terms the petitioners,\r\nor those who imprisoned and fined them, and seized their papers. Mr.\r\nHutchinson, the best informed and most candid of the New England\r\nhistorians, states the affair of the petitioners, their proceedings and\r\ntreatment, and the petition which they presented, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A great disturbance was caused in the colony this year [1646] by a\r\nnumber of persons of figure, but of different sentiments, both as to\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical government, from the people in general. They\r\nhad laid a scheme for petition of such as were non-freemen to the courts\r\nof both colonies, and upon the petitions being refused, to apply to the\r\nParliament, pretending they were subjected to arbitrary power,\r\nextra-judicial proceedings, etc. The principal things complained of by\r\nthe petitioners were:\r\n\r\n\"1st. That the fundamental laws of England were not owned by the Colony,\r\nas the basis of their government, according to the patent.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. The denial of those civil privileges, which the freemen of the\r\njurisdiction enjoyed, to such as were not members of Churches, and did\r\nnot take an oath of fidelity devised by the authority here, although\r\nthey were freeborn Englishmen, of sober lives and conversation, etc.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. That they were debarred from Christian privileges, viz., the\r\nLord's Supper for themselves, and baptism for their children, unless\r\nthey were members of some of the particular Churches in the country,\r\nthough otherwise sober, righteous, and godly, and eminent for knowledge,\r\nnot scandalous in life and conversation, and members of Churches in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\"And they prayed that civil liberty and freedom might be forthwith\r\ngranted to all truly English, and that all members of the Church of\r\nEngland or Scotland, not scandalous, might be admitted to the privileges\r\nof the Churches of New England; or if these civil and religious\r\nliberties were refused, that they might be freed from the heavy taxes\r\nimposed upon them, and from the impresses made of them or their children\r\nor servants into the war; and if they failed of redress there, they\r\nshould be under the necessity of making application to England, to the\r\nhonourable Houses of Parliament, who they hoped would take their sad\r\ncondition, etc.\r\n\r\n\"But if their prayer should be granted, they hoped to see the then\r\ncontemned ordinances of God highly prized; the Gospel, then dark, break\r\nforth as the sun; Christian charity, then frozen, wax warm; jealousy of\r\narbitrary government banished; strife and contention abated; and all\r\nbusiness in Church and State, which for many years had gone backward,\r\nsuccessfully thriving, etc.\r\n\r\n\"The Court, and great part of the country, were much offended at this\r\npetition. A declaration was drawn up by order of the Court, in answer to\r\nthe petition, and in vindication of the Government--a proceeding which\r\nat this day would not appear for the honour of the supreme authority.\r\nThe petitioners were required to attend the Court. They urged their\r\nright of petitioning. They were told they were not accused of\r\npetitioning, but of contemptuous and seditious expressions, and were\r\nrequired to find sureties for their good behaviour, etc. A charge was\r\ndrawn up against them in form; notwithstanding which it was intimated to\r\nthem, that if they would ingenuously acknowledge their offence, they\r\nshould be forgiven; but they refused, and were fined, some in larger,\r\nsome in smaller sums, two or three of the magistrates dissenting, Mr.\r\nBellingham,[85] in particular, desiring his dissent might be entered.\r\nThe petitioners claimed an appeal to the Commissioners of Plantations\r\nin England; but it was not allowed. Some of them resolved to go home\r\nwith a complaint. Their papers were seized, and among them was found a\r\npetition to the Right Honourable the Earl of Warwick, etc.,\r\nCommissioners, from about five and twenty non-freemen, for themselves\r\nand many thousands more, in which they represent that from the\r\npulpits[86] they had been reproached and branded with the names of\r\ndestroyers of Churches and Commonwealths, called Hamans, Judases, sons\r\nof Korah, and the Lord entreated to confound them, and the people and\r\nmagistrates stirred up against them by those who were too forward to\r\nstep out of their callings, so that they had been sent for to the Court,\r\nand some of them committed for refusing to give two hundred pounds bond\r\nto stand to the sentence of the Court, _when all the crime was a\r\npetition to the Court_, and they had been publicly used as malefactors,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Winslow, who had been chosen agent for the colony to answer to\r\nGorton's complaint, was now instructed to make defence against these\r\npetitioners; and by his prudent management, and the credit and esteem he\r\nwas in with many members of the Parliament and principal persons then in\r\npower, he prevented any prejudice to the colony from either of these\r\napplications.\"[87]\r\n\r\nMr. (Edward) Winslow, above mentioned by Mr. Hutchinson, had been one\r\nof the founders and Governors of the _Plymouth_ colony; but twenty-five\r\nyears afterwards he imbibed the persecuting spirit of the Massachusetts\r\nBay colony, became their agent and advocate in London, and by the\r\nprestige which he had acquired as the first narrator and afterwards\r\nGovernor of the Plymouth colony, had much influence with the leading men\r\nof the Long Parliament. He there joined himself to Cromwell, and was\r\nappointed one of his three Commissioners to the West Indies, where he\r\ndied in 1655. Cromwell, as he said when he first obtained possession of\r\nthe King, had \"the Parliament in his pocket;\" he had abolished the\r\nPrayer Book and its worship; he had expurgated the army of\r\nPresbyterians, and filled their places with Congregationalists; he was\r\nrepeating the same process in Parliament; and through him, therefore\r\n(who was also Commander-in-Chief of all the Parliamentary forces), Mr.\r\nWinslow had little difficulty in stifling the appeal from Massachusetts\r\nBay for liberty of worship in behalf of both Presbyterians and\r\nEpiscopalians.\r\n\r\nBut was ever a petition to a local Legislature more constitutional, or\r\nmore open and manly in the manner of its getting up, more Christian in\r\nits sentiments and objects? Yet the petitioners were arraigned and\r\npunished as \"conspirators\" and \"disturbers of the public peace,\" by\r\norder of that Legislature, for openly petitioning to it against some of\r\nits own acts. Was ever appeal to the Imperial Parliament by British\r\nsubjects more justifiable than that of Dr. Child, Mr. Dand, Mr. Vassal\r\n(progenitor of British Peers), and others, from acts of a local\r\nGovernment which deprived them of both religious rights of worship and\r\ncivil rights of franchise, of all things earthly most valued by\r\nenlightened men, and without which the position of man is little better\r\nthan that of goods and chattels? Yet the respectable men who appealed to\r\nthe supreme power of the realm for the attainment of these attributes of\r\nChristian and British citizenship were imprisoned and heavily fined,\r\nand their private papers seized and sequestered!\r\n\r\nIn my own native country of Upper Canada, the Government for nearly half\r\na century was considered despotic, and held up by American writers\r\nthemselves as an unbearable tyranny. But one Church was alleged to be\r\nestablished in the country, and the government was that of a Church\r\nparty; but never was the elective franchise there confined to the\r\nmembers of the one Church; never were men and women denied, or hailed\r\nbefore the legal tribunals and fined for exercising the privilege of\r\nBaptism, the Lord's Supper, or public worship for themselves and\r\nfamilies according to the dictates of their own consciences; never was\r\nthe humblest inhabitant denied the right of petition to the local\r\nLegislature on any subject, or against any governmental acts, or the\r\nright of appeal to the Imperial Government or Parliament on the subject\r\nof any alleged grievance. The very suspicion and allegation that the\r\nCanadian Government did counteract, by influences and secret\r\nrepresentations, the statements of complaining parties to England,\r\nroused public indignation as arbitrary and unconstitutional. Even the\r\ninsurrection which took place in both Upper and Lower Canada in 1837 and\r\n1838 was professedly against alleged partiality and injustice by the\r\n_local_ Government, as an obstruction to more liberal policy believed to\r\nbe desired by the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\nBut here, in Massachusetts, a colony chartered as a Company to\r\ndistribute and settle public lands and carry on trade, in less than\r\ntwenty years assumes the powers of a sovereign Commonwealth, denies to\r\nfive-sixths of the population the freedom of citizenship, and limits it\r\nto the members of one Church, and denies Baptism, the Lord's Supper, and\r\nworship to all who will not come to the one Church, punishes petitioners\r\nto itself for civil and religious freedom from those who were deprived\r\nof it, and punishes as \"treason\" their appeal for redress to the English\r\nParliament. Though, for the present, this unprecedented and unparalleled\r\nlocal despotism was sustained by the ingenious representations of Mr.\r\nWinslow and the power of Cromwell; yet in the course of four years the\r\nsurrender of its Charter was ordered by the regicide councillors of the\r\nCommonwealth, as it had been ordered by the beheaded King Charles and\r\nhis Privy Council thirteen years before. In the meantime tragical\r\nevents in England diverted attention from the colonies. The King was\r\nmade prisoner, then put to death; the Monarchy was abolished, as well as\r\nthe House of Lords; and the Long Parliament became indeed Cromwell's\r\n\"pocket\" instrument.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest that the government of Massachusetts Bay as a colony was\r\nimpossible, with the pretensions which it had set up, declaring all\r\nappeals to England to be \"treason,\" and punishing complainants as\r\n\"conspirators\" and \"traitors.\" The appointment by Parliament in 1643 of\r\na Governor-General and Commissioners had produced no effect in\r\nMassachusetts Bay Colony; pretensions to supremacy and persecution were\r\nas rife as ever there. Dr. Child and his friends were punished for even\r\nasking for the administration that appointed the Governor-General and\r\nthose Commissioners; and whether the Government of England were a\r\nmonarchy or republic, it was clear that the pretensions to independence\r\nof the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay must be checked, and their local\r\ntyranny restrained. For this purpose the Long Parliament adopted the\r\nsame policy in 1650 that King Charles had done in 1637; demanded the\r\nsurrender of the Charter; for that Parliament sent a summons to the\r\nlocal Government ordering it to transmit the Charter to England, to\r\nreceive a new patent from the Parliament in all its acts and processes.\r\n\r\nThis order of Parliament to Massachusetts Bay Colony to surrender its\r\nCharter was accompanied by a proclamation prohibiting trade with\r\nVirginia, Barbadoes, Bermuda, and Antigua, because these colonies\r\ncontinued to recognize royal authority, and to administer their laws in\r\nthe name of the King. This duplicate order from the Long Parliament was\r\na double blow to the colony of Massachusetts Bay, and produced general\r\nconsternation; but the dexterity and diplomacy of the colony were equal\r\nto the occasion. It showed its devotion to the cause of the Long\r\nParliament by passing an Act prohibiting trade with the loyal, but by\r\nthem termed rebel colonies;[88] and it avoided surrendering the Charter\r\nby repeating its policy of delay and petition, which it had adopted on a\r\nsimilar occasion in 1638 to King Charles; and its professions of\r\nloyalty to Charles, and prayers for the Royal Family, and the success of\r\nthe Privy Council, it now repeated for the Long Parliament and its\r\nleaders, supporting its petition by an appeal to its ten years' services\r\nof prayers and of men to the cause of the Long Parliament against the\r\nKing. I will, in the first place, give in a note Mr. Bancroft's own\r\naccount of what was claimed and ordered by the Long Parliament, and the\r\npretensions and proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts Bay, and\r\nthen will give the principal parts of their petition to the Long\r\nParliament in their own words. The words and statements of Mr. Bancroft\r\ninvolve several things worthy of notice and remembrance: 1. The\r\nCongregational Church rulers of Massachusetts Bay denied being British\r\nsubjects, admitting no other allegiance to England than the Hanse Towns\r\nof Northern Germany to the Empire of Austria, or the Normandy ducal\r\nkings of England to the King of France; or, as Mr. Palfrey says, \"the\r\nrelations which Burgundy and Flanders hold to France.\" 2. Mr. Bancroft\r\ncalls the petitioners \"disturbers of the public security,\" and Mr.\r\nPalfrey calls them \"conspirators\"--terms applied to the Armenian\r\nremonstrants against the persecuting edicts of the Synod of Dort--terms\r\napplied to all the complainants of the exclusive and persecuting policy\r\nof the Tudor and Stuart kings of England--terms applied to even the\r\nfirst Christians--terms now applied to pleaders of religious and civil\r\nfreedom by the advocates of a Massachusetts Government as intolerant and\r\npersecuting as ever existed in Europe. The petition of these impugned\r\nparties shows that all they asked for was equal religious and civil\r\nliberty and protection with their Congregational oppressors. Opprobrious\r\nnames are not arguments; and imputations of motives and character are\r\nnot facts, and are usually resorted to for want of them. 3. Mr. Bancroft\r\ndesignates as \"usurpations of Parliament\" the proceedings of the Long\r\nParliament in appointing a Governor-General and Commissioners for the\r\ncolonies, and in exercising its right to receive and decide upon appeals\r\nfrom the colonies; and terms the support of the Parliament in the colony\r\n\"domestic treachery;\" and the one member of the Legislature who had the\r\ncourage to maintain the supremacy of the Mother Country is called the\r\n\"faithless deputy,\" who was forthwith turned out of the House, which\r\nthen proceeded, \"with closed doors,\" to discuss in secret conclave its\r\nrelations to England, and concluded by declaring \"against any assertion\r\nof paramount authority\" on the part of the English Parliament. This was\r\nsubstantially a \"Declaration of Independence;\" not, indeed, against an\r\narbitrary king, as was alleged sixteen years before, and a hundred and\r\nthirty years afterwards, but against a Parliament which had dethroned\r\nand beheaded their King, and abolished the House of Lords and the\r\nEpiscopal Church! All this Mr. Bancroft now treats as maintaining the\r\n_Charter_, of which he himself had declared, in another place, as I have\r\nquoted above: \"The Charter on which the freemen of Massachusetts\r\nsucceeded in erecting a system of independent representative liberty did\r\nnot secure to them a single privilege of self-government, but left them\r\nas the Virginians had been left, without any valuable franchise, at the\r\nmercy of the Corporation within the realm.\" Who then were the\r\n\"usurpers,\" and had been for twenty years, of power which had not been\r\nconferred on them--the new Church and the persecuting Government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, or the supreme authority of England, both under a\r\nKing and under a professed republican commonwealth? 4. Mr. Bancroft\r\nsays: \"Had the Long Parliament succeeded in revoking the patent of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay,[90] the tenor of American history would have been\r\nchanged.\" I agree with him in this opinion, though probably not in his\r\napplication of it. I believe that the \"tenor of American history\" would\r\nhave led to as perfect an independence of the American States as they\r\nnow enjoy--as free, but a better system of government, and without their\r\never having made war and bloodshed against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe facts thus referred to show that there were _Empire Loyalists_ in\r\nAmerica in the seventeenth, as there were afterwards in the eighteenth\r\ncentury; they then embraced all the colonies of New England, except the\r\nruling party of Massachusetts Bay; they were all advocates of an equal\r\nfranchise, and equal religious and civil liberty for all classes--the\r\nvery reverse of the Massachusetts Government, which, while it denied any\r\nsubordination to England, denied religious and civil liberty to all\r\nclasses except members of the Congregational Churches.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious and significant fact, stated by Mr. Bancroft, that these\r\nintolerant and persecuting proceedings of the Massachusetts Bay\r\nLegislature were submitted to the Congregational ministers for their\r\napproval and final endorsement. The Long Parliament in England checked\r\nand ruled the Assembly of Westminster divines; but in Massachusetts the\r\ndivines, after a day's consideration, \"approved the proceedings of the\r\nGeneral Court.\" No wonder that such divines, supported by taxes levied\r\nby the State and rulers of the State, denounced all toleration of\r\ndissent from their Church and authority.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, I must notice the remarks of Mr.\r\nPalfrey,--the second, if not first in authority of the historians of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMr. Palfrey ascribes what he calls \"the Presbyterian Cabal\" to Mr.\r\nWilliam Vassal, who was one of the founders and first Council of the\r\ncolony of Massachusetts Bay, whose brother Samuel had shared with\r\nHampden the honour of having refused to pay ship-money to Charles, and\r\nwho was now, with the Earl of Warwick,[91] one of the Parliamentary\r\nCommissioners for the colonies. It appears that Mr. Vassal opposed from\r\nthe beginning the new system of Church and proscriptive civil government\r\nset up at Massachusetts Bay, and therefore came under Mr. Bancroft's\r\ncategory of \"disturbers of the public security,\" and Mr. Palfrey's\r\ndesignation of \"conspirators;\" but was in reality a liberal and a\r\nloyalist, not to King Charles indeed, but to the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland. I give Mr. Palfrey's statements, in his own words, in a\r\nnote.[92]\r\n\r\nThe spirit and sentiments of Mr. Palfrey are identical with those which\r\nI have quoted of Mr. Bancroft; but while Mr. Bancroft speaks\r\ncontemptuously of the authors of the petition for equal civil and\r\nreligious rights, Mr. Palfrey traces the movement to Mr. William Vassal,\r\none of the founders and first Council of the Massachusetts Colony, and\r\nprogenitor of the famous Whig family of Holland House. Nor does Mr.\r\nPalfrey venture to question the doctrine or one of the statements of the\r\npetitioners, though he calls them \"conspirators.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Palfrey--very unfairly, I think--imputes to the petitioners a design\r\nto subvert the Congregational worship and establish the Presbyterian\r\nworship in its place; and to give force to his imputations says that a\r\nnumerous party in the English Parliament \"were bent on setting up\r\nPresbytery as the established religion in England and _its\r\ndependencies_.\" There is not the slightest ground for asserting that any\r\nparty in the Long Parliament, any more than in Massachusetts, designed\r\nthe setting up of Presbytery as _the_ established worship in the\r\n\"_dependencies_ of England.\" King Charles the First, on his first\r\nsitting in judgment on complaints against the proceedings of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Council, declared to his Privy Council, in 1632, that\r\nhe had never intended to impose the Church ceremonies, objected to by\r\nthe Puritan clergy of the time, upon the colonists of Massachusetts.\r\nCharles the Second, thirty years afterwards, declared the same, and\r\nacted upon it during the quarter of a century of his reign. The Long\r\nParliament acted upon the same principle. There is not an instance,\r\nduring the whole sixty years of the first Massachusetts Charter, of any\r\nattempt, on the part of either King or Commonwealth, to suppress or\r\ninterfere with the Congregational worship in New England; all that was\r\nasked by the King, or any party in Massachusetts, was _toleration_ of\r\nother forms of Protestant worship as well as that of the Congregational.\r\nThe very petition, whose promoters are represented as movers of\r\nsedition, asked for no exclusive establishment of Presbyterianism, but\r\nfor the toleration of both the Episcopal and Presbyterian worship, and\r\nthe worship of other Protestant Churches existing in England; and their\r\npetition was addressed to a Legislature of Congregationalists, elected\r\nby Congregationalists alone; and it was only in the event of their\r\nreasonable requests not being granted by the local Legislature that they\r\nproposed to present their grievances to the Imperial Parliament. The\r\nplea of fear for the safety of Congregational worship in Massachusetts\r\nwas a mere pretence to justify the proscription and persecution of all\r\ndissent from the Congregational establishment. The spirit of the local\r\nGovernment and of the clergy that controlled it was _intolerance_.\r\nToleration was denounced by them as the doctrine of devils; and the\r\ndying lines of Governor Dudley are reported to have been--\r\n\r\n   \"Let men of God, in Court and Church, watch\r\n   O'er such as do a toleration hatch.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThere is one other of Mr. Palfrey's statements which is of special\r\nimportance; it is the admission that a majority of the population of\r\nMassachusetts were excluded from all share in the Government, and were\r\nactually opposed to it. Referring to the petition to the local\r\nLegislature, he says: \"The demand was enforced by considerations which\r\nwere not without plausibility, and were presented in a seductive form.\r\nIt was itself an appeal to the _discontent of the numerical majority not\r\ninvested with a share in the government_.\"[95]\r\n\r\nIt is thus admitted, and clear from indubitable facts, that professing\r\nto be republicans, they denied to the great majority of the people any\r\nshare in the government. Professing hatred of the persecuting\r\nintolerance of King Charles and Laud in denying liberty of worship to\r\nall who differed from them, they now deny liberty of worship to all who\r\ndiffer from themselves, and punish those by fine and imprisonment who\r\neven petition for equal religious and civil liberty to all classes of\r\ncitizens. They justify even armed resistance against the King, and\r\nactually decapitating as well as dethroning him, in order to obtain,\r\nprofessedly, a government by the majority of the nation and liberty of\r\nworship; and they now deny the same principle and right of civil and\r\nreligious liberty to the great majority of the people over whom they\r\nclaimed rule. They claim the right of resisting Parliament itself by\r\narmed force if they had the power, and only desist from asserting it, to\r\nthe last, as the _salus populi_ did not require it, and for the sake of\r\ntheir \"godly friends in England,\" and to not afford a pretext for the\r\n\"rebellious course\" of their fellow-colonists in Virginia and the West\r\nIndies, who claimed the same independence of Parliament that the\r\nGovernment of Massachusetts claimed, but upon the ground which was\r\nabhorrent to the Congregational Puritans of Massachusetts--namely, that\r\nof loyalty to the king.\r\n\r\nI will now give in a note, in their own words, the principal parts of\r\ntheir petition, entitled \"General Court of Massachusetts Bay, New\r\nEngland, in a Petition to Parliament in 1651,\"[97] together with\r\nextracts of two addresses to Cromwell, the one enclosing a copy of their\r\npetition to Parliament, when he was Commander-in-Chief of the army, and\r\nthe other in 1654, after he had dismissed the Rump Parliament, and\r\nbecome absolute--denying to the whole people of England the elective\r\nfranchise, as his admiring friends in Massachusetts denied it to the\r\ngreat majority of the people within their jurisdiction. Chalmers says\r\nthey \"outfawned and outwitted Cromwell.\" They gained his support by\r\ntheir first address, and thanked him for it in their second. Having \"the\r\nParliament in his pocket\" until he threw even the rump of it aside\r\naltogether, Cromwell caused Parliament to desist from executing its own\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the following chapter, that ten years after these\r\nlaudatory addresses to Parliament and Cromwell, the same General Court\r\nof Massachusetts addressed Charles the Second in words truly loyal and\r\nequally laudatory, and implored the continuance of their Charter upon\r\nthe ground, among other reasons, that they had never identified\r\nthemselves with the Parliament against his Royal father, but had been\r\n\"passive\" during the whole of that contest. Their act against having any\r\ncommerce with the colonies who adhered to the King indicated their\r\nneutrality; and the reader, by reading their addresses to the Parliament\r\nand Cromwell, will see whether they did not thoroughly identify\r\nthemselves with the Parliament and Cromwell against Charles the First.\r\nThey praise Cromwell as raised up by the special hand of God, and crave\r\nupon him the success of \"the Captain of the Lord's hosts;\" and they\r\nclaim the favourable consideration of Parliament to their request upon\r\nthe ground that they had identified themselves with its fortunes to rise\r\nor fall with it; that they had aided it by their prayers and fastings,\r\nand by men who had rendered it valuable service. The reader will be able\r\nto judge of the agreement in their _professions_ and _statements_ in\r\ntheir addresses to Parliament and Cromwell and to King Charles the\r\nSecond ten years afterwards. In their addresses to Parliament and\r\nCromwell they professed their readiness to _fall_ as well as rise with\r\nthe cause of the Parliament; but when that _fell_, they repudiated all\r\nconnection with it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1651, and during the very Session of Parliament to which the\r\nGeneral Court addressed its petition and narrated its sacrifices and\r\ndoings in the cause of the Parliament, the latter passed the famous\r\nNavigation Act, which was re-enacted and improved ten years afterwards,\r\nunder Charles the Second, and which became the primary pretext of the\r\nAmerican Revolution. The Commonwealth was at this time at war with the\r\nDutch republic, which had almost destroyed and absorbed the shipping\r\ntrade of England. Admiral Blake was just commencing that series of naval\r\nvictories which have immortalized his name, and placed England from that\r\ntime to this at the head of the naval powers of the world. Sir Henry\r\nVane, as the Minister of the Navy, devised and carried through\r\nParliament the famous Navigation Act--an Act which the colony of\r\nMassachusetts, by the connivance of Cromwell (who now identified himself\r\nwith that colony), regularly evaded, at the expense of the American\r\ncolonies and the English revenue.[98] Mr. Palfrey says:\r\n\r\n\"The people of Massachusetts might well be satisfied with their\r\ncondition and prospects. Everything was prospering with them. They had\r\nestablished comfortable homes, which they felt strong enough to defend\r\nagainst any power but the power of the Mother Country; and that was\r\nfriendly. They had always the good-will of Cromwell. In relation _to\r\nthem_, he allowed the Navigation Law, _which pressed on the Southern\r\ncolonies, to became_ A DEAD LETTER, and they received the commodities of\r\nall nations free of duty, and sent their ships to all the ports of\r\ncontinental Europe.\"[99]\r\n\r\nBut that in which the ruling spirits of the Massachusetts General\r\nCourt--apart from their ceaseless endeavours to monopolise trade and\r\nextend territory--seemed to revel most was in searching out and\r\npunishing _dissent_ from the Congregational Establishment, and, at\r\ntimes, with the individual liberty of citizens in sumptuary matters. No\r\nLaud ever equalled them in this, or excelled them in enforcing\r\nuniformity, not only of doctrine, but of opinions and practice in the\r\nminutest particulars. When a stand against England was to be taken, in\r\nworship, or inquisition into matters of religions dissent, and woman's\r\napparel, Endicot became Governor (according to the \"advice of the\r\nElders\" in such matters), and Winthrop was induced to be Deputy\r\nGovernor, although the latter was hardly second to the former in the\r\nspirit and acts of religious persecution. He had been a wealthy man in\r\nEngland, and was well educated and amiable; but after his arrival at\r\nMassachusetts Bay he seems to have wanted firmness to resist the\r\nintolerant spirit and narrow views of Endicot. He died in 1649. Mr.\r\nPalfrey remarks: \"Whether it was owing to solicitude as to the course of\r\naffairs in England after the downfall of the Royal power, or to the\r\nabsence of the moderating influence of Winthrop, or to sentiments\r\nengendered, on the one hand by the alarm from the Presbyterians in 1646,\r\nand on the other by the confidence inspired by the [Congregational]\r\nSynod in 1648, or to all these causes in their degree, the years 1650\r\nand 1651 appear to have been some of more than common sensibility in\r\nMassachusetts to danger from _Heretics_.\"[100]\r\n\r\nIn 1650, the General Court condemned, and ordered to be publicly burnt,\r\na book entitled \"The Meritorious Price of our Redemption, Justification,\r\netc., Clearing of some Common Errors,\" written and published in England,\r\nby Mr. Pynchion, \"an ancient and venerable magistrate.\" This book was\r\ndeficient in orthodoxy, in the estimation of Mr. Endicot and his\r\ncolleagues, was condemned to be burnt, and the author was summoned to\r\nanswer for it at the bar of the inquisitorial court. His explanation was\r\nunsatisfactory; and he was commanded to appear a second time, under a\r\npenalty of one hundred pounds; but he returned to England, and left his\r\ninquisitors without further remedy.\r\n\r\n\"About the same time,\" says Mr. Palfrey, \"the General Court had a\r\ndifficulty with the Church of Malden. Mr. Marmaduke Matthews having\r\n'given offence to magistrates, elders, and many brethren, in some unsafe\r\nand unsound expressions in his public teaching,' and the Church of\r\nMalden having proceeded to ordain him, in disregard of remonstrances\r\nfrom 'both magistrates, ministers, and churches,' Matthews was fined ten\r\npounds for assuming the sacred office, and the Church was summoned to\r\nmake its defence\" (Massachusetts Records, III., 237); which \"failing to\r\ndo satisfactorily, it was punished by a fine of fifty pounds--Mr.\r\nHathorne, Mr. Leverett, and seven other Deputies recording their votes\r\nagainst the sentence.\" (_Ibid._ 252; compare 276, 289.)\r\n\r\nBut these reputed fathers of civil and religious liberty not only held\r\ninquisition over the religious writings and teachings of magistrates and\r\nministers, and the independence of their Congregational Churches, but\r\neven over the property, the income, and the apparel of individuals; for\r\nin this same year, 1651, they passed a Sumptuary Act. Mr. Holmes justly\r\nremarks: \"This sumptuary law, for the matter and style, is a curiosity.\"\r\nThe Court, lamenting the inefficacy of former \"Declarations and Orders\r\nagainst excess of apparel, both of men and women,\" proceed to observe:\r\n\"We cannot but to our grief take notice, that intolerable excess and\r\nbravery hath crept in upon us, and especially among people of mean\r\ncondition, to the dishonour of God, the scandal of our profession, the\r\nconsumption of estates, and altogether unsuitable to our poverty. The\r\nCourt proceed to order, that no person whose visible estate should not\r\nexceed the true and indifferent sum of £200, shall wear any gold or\r\nsilver lace, or gold and silver buttons, or have any lace above two\r\nshillings per yard, or silk hoods or scarves, on the penalty of ten\r\nshillings for every such offence.\" The select men of every town were\r\nrequired to take notice of the apparel of any of the inhabitants, and to\r\nassess such persons as \"they shall judge to exceed their ranks and\r\nabilities, in the costliness or fashion of their apparel in any respect,\r\nespecially in wearing of ribbands and great boots,\" at £200 estates,\r\naccording to the proportion which some men used to pay to whom such\r\napparel is suitable and allowed. An exception, however, is made in\r\nfavour of public officers and their families, and of those \"whose\r\neducation and employment have been above the ordinary degree, or whose\r\nestates have been considerable, though now decayed.\"[101]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected by the reader that in 1644 the Massachusetts Bay\r\nCourt passed an act of banishment, etc., against Baptists; that in 1643\r\nit put to \"the rout\" the Presbyterians, who made a move for the\r\ntoleration of their worship; that in 1646, when the Presbyterians and\r\nsome Episcopalians petitioned the local Court for liberty of worship,\r\nand in the event of refusal expressed their determination to appeal to\r\nthe English Parliament, they were punished with fines and imprisonment,\r\nand their papers were seized. The above acts of censorship over the\r\npress, and private opinions in the case of Mr. Pinchion, and their\r\ntyranny over the organization of new Churches and the ordinations of\r\nministers--fining both Church and ministers for exercising what is\r\nuniversally acknowledged to be essential to _independent_ worship--are\r\nbut further illustrations of the same spirit of intolerance. It was the\r\nintolerance of the Massachusetts Bay Government that caused the\r\nsettlement of Connecticut, of New Haven, as well as of Rhode Island. The\r\nnoble minds of the younger Winthrop, of Eaton, no more than that of\r\nRoger Williams, could shrivel themselves into the nutshell littleness of\r\nthe Massachusetts Bay Government--so called, indeed, by courtesy, or by\r\nway of accommodation, rather than as conveying a proper idea of a\r\nGovernment, as it consisted solely of Congregationalists, who alone were\r\neligible to office and eligible as electors to office, and was therefore\r\nmore properly a Congregational Association than a civil government; yet\r\nthis association assumed the combined powers of legislation,\r\nadministration of government and law, and of the army--absolute\r\ncensorship of the press, of worship, of even private opinions--and\r\npunished as criminals those who even expressed their griefs in\r\npetitions; and when punished they had the additional aggravation of\r\nbeing told that they were not punished for petitioning, but for what the\r\npetitions contained, as if they could petition without using words, and\r\nas if they could express their griefs and wishes without using words for\r\nthat purpose. Yet under such pretexts was a despotism established and\r\nmaintained for sixty years without a parallel in the annals of colonial\r\nhistory, ancient or modern; under which five-sixths of the population\r\nhad no more freedom of worship, of opinion, or of franchise, than the\r\nslaves of the Southern States before the recent civil war. It is not\r\nsurprising that a Government based on no British principle, based on the\r\nabove principle of a one Church membership, every franchise under which\r\nwas granted, or cancelled, or continued at the pleasure of Elders and\r\ntheir Courts--such a Government, un-British in its foundation and\r\nelements, could not be expected to be loyal to the Royal branch of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that even among the Puritan party themselves, who\r\nwere now warring against the King, and who were soon to bring him to the\r\nblock, such unmitigated despotism and persecutions in Massachusetts\r\nshould call forth, here and there, a voice of remonstrance,\r\nnotwithstanding the argus-eyed watchfulness and espionage exercised by\r\nthe Church government at Massachusetts Bay over all persons and papers\r\ndestined for England, and especially in regard to every suspected person\r\nor paper. One of these is from Sir Henry Vane, who went to Massachusetts\r\nin 1636, and was elected Governor; but he was in favour of toleration,\r\nand resisted the persecution against Mrs. Anne Hutchinson and her\r\nbrother, Mr. Wheelwright. The persecuting party proved too strong for\r\nhim, and he resigned his office before the end of the year. He was\r\nsucceeded as Governor by Mr. Winthrop, who ordered him to quit\r\nMassachusetts. He was, I think, the purest if not the best statesman of\r\nhis time;[102] he was too good a man to cherish resentment against\r\nWinthrop or against the colony, but returned good for evil in regard to\r\nboth in after years. Sir Henry Vane wrote to Governor Winthrop, in\r\nregard to these persecutions, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Honoured Sir,--\r\n\r\n\"I received yours by your son, and was unwilling to let him return\r\nwithout telling you as much. The exercise of troubles which God is\r\npleased to lay upon these kingdoms and the inhabitants in them, teaches\r\nus patience and forbearance one with another in some measure, though\r\nthere be no difference in our opinions, which makes me hope, that from\r\nthe experience here, it may also be derived to yourselves, lest while\r\nthe Congregational way amongst you is in its freedom, and is backed with\r\npower, it teach its oppugners here to extirpate it and roote it out, and\r\nfrom its own principles and practice. I shall need say no more, knowing\r\nyour son can acquaint you particularly with our affairs.\r\n\r\n\"&c., &c.,\r\nH. VANE.[103]\r\nJune 10, 1645.\"\r\n\r\nAnother and more elaborate remonstrance of the same kind was written by\r\nSir Richard Saltonstall, one of the original founders, and of the first\r\nCouncil of the Company--one who had appeared before the King in Council\r\nin 1632, in defence of Endicot and his Council, in answer to the charges\r\nof Church innovation, of abolishing the worship of the Church of\r\nEngland, and banishing the Browns on account of their adhering to the\r\nworship which all the emigrants professed on their leaving England. Sir\r\nR. Saltonstall and Mr. Cradock, the Governor of the Company, could\r\nappeal to the address of Winthrop and his eleven ships of emigrants,\r\nwhich they had delivered to their \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of\r\nEngland\" on their departure for America, as to their undying love and\r\noneness with the Church of England, and their taking Church of England\r\nchaplains with them; they could appeal to the letter of Deputy Governor\r\nDudley to Lady Lincoln, denying that any innovations or changes whatever\r\nhad been introduced; they could appeal to the positive statements of the\r\nRev. John White, \"the Patriarch of Dorchester,\" a Conformist clergyman,\r\nand the first projector of the colony, declaring that the charges of\r\ninnovations, etc., were calumnies. Doubtless all these parties believed\r\nwhat they said; they believed the denials and professions made to them;\r\nand they repeated them to the King's Privy Council with such earnestness\r\nas to have quite captivated the Judges, to have secured even the\r\nsympathies of the King, who was far from being the enemy of the colony\r\nrepresented by his enemies. Accordingly, an order was made in Council,\r\nJanuary 19, 1632, \"declaring the fair appearances and great hopes which\r\nthere then were, that the country would prove beneficial to the kingdom,\r\nas profitable to the particular persons concerned, and that the\r\n_adventurers might be assured_ that if things should be carried as was\r\npretended when the patents were granted, and according as by the patent\r\nis appointed, his Majesty would not only maintain the liberties and\r\nprivileges heretofore granted, but supply anything further which might\r\ntend to the good government, prosperity, and comfort of the people\r\nthere.\" According to the statement of some of the Privy Council, the\r\nKing himself said \"he would have severely punished who did abuse his\r\nGovernor and Plantation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Palfrey well observes: \"Saltonstall, Humphrey, and Cradock appeared\r\nbefore a Committee of the Council on the Company's behalf, and had the\r\n_address or good fortune_ to vindicate their clients.\"[104] It was\r\ncertainly owing to their \"address or good fortune,\" and not to the\r\njustice of their case, that they succeeded in deceiving the King and\r\nCouncil. The complainants had unwisely mixed the charge of disloyal\r\nspeeches, etc., with Church innovations. It was to parry the former, by\r\nassuming the statements to be _ex parte_, and at any rate uttered by\r\nprivate individuals, who should be called to account for their conduct,\r\nand for whose words the Company could not be justly held responsible. On\r\nthe main charge of Church innovations, or Church revolution, and\r\nproscription of the worship of the Church of England, positive denials\r\nwere opposed--the profession of Winthrop with his company and chaplains\r\non leaving England, the positive statement of the \"Patriarch of\r\nDorchester,\" and that of Deputy Governor Dudley, who went to\r\nMassachusetts with Winthrop, and wrote to the Countess of Lincoln the\r\nyear after his arrival, denying that any innovations had been made. To\r\nall this the complainants had only to oppose their own words--their\r\npapers having been seized. They were overwhelmed by the mass of\r\nauthority arrayed against them. But though they were defeated for the\r\ntime, they were not silenced; and the following two years were\r\nproductive of such a mass of rumours and statements, all tending to\r\nprove the Church revolutionary and Church proscriptive proceedings of\r\nthe Massachusetts Corporation, that the King and Council found it\r\nnecessary to prosecute those inquiries which they had deferred in 1632,\r\nand to appoint a Royal Commission to proceed to Massachusetts Bay and\r\ninquire into the disputed facts, and correct all abuses, if such should\r\nbe found, on the spot. This was what the Massachusetts Bay persecutors\r\nmost dreaded. As long as the inquiry should be conducted in London, they\r\ncould, by intercepting papers and intimidating witnesses, and with the\r\naid of powerful friends in England--one or two of whom managed to retain\r\ntheir place in office and in the Privy Council, even when Charles ruled\r\nwithout a Parliament--with such advantages they could laugh to scorn the\r\ncomplaints of the persecuted, and continue their proscriptions and\r\noppressions with impunity. But with a Royal Commission sitting on the\r\nspot, these acts of concealment and deception would be impossible. They\r\ntherefore changed their ground; they now denied the right of the King to\r\ninquire into their proceedings; they invoked, as was their wont, the\r\ncounsel of their ministers, or \"Elders,\" who preached warlike sermons\r\nand gave warlike advice--\"to resist if they were strong enough;\" but if\r\nnot strong enough to fight, \"to avoid and delay.\" For the former purpose\r\nthey forthwith raised £800 to erect a fort to protect the entrance of\r\ntheir harbour, and organized and armed companies; and in pursuance of\r\nthe latter, they delayed a year even to acknowledge the receipt of the\r\nRoyal orders to answer the charges preferred against them, and then,\r\nwhen a more imperative and threatening Royal demand was sent, they\r\npleaded for another year to prepare for their defence, and thus \"avoided\r\nand delayed\" from time to time, until the King, getting so entangled\r\nwith his Scottish subjects and Parliament, became unable to pursue his\r\ninquiries into the proceedings of the Massachusetts Bay Plantation; and\r\nthe Congregational Church rulers there had, for more than twenty years,\r\nthe luxury of absolute rule and unrestricted persecution of all that\r\ndissented from their newly set up Church polity and worship.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Saltonstall, as well as Sir Henry Vane, and doubtless many\r\nothers of the Puritan party in England, could not endure in silence the\r\noutrageous perversions of the Charter, and high-handed persecutions by\r\nthe Congregational rulers of Massachusetts Bay.[105] Sir R. Saltonstall\r\ntherefore wrote to Cotton and Wilson, who, with Norton, were the ablest\r\npreachers among the \"Elders,\" and were the fiercest persecutors. The\r\nletter is without date, but is stated by Mr. Hutchinson, in his\r\nCollection of Massachusetts State Papers, to have been written \"some\r\ntime between 1645 and 1653.\" Sir R. Saltonstall's indignant and noble\r\nremonstrance is as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"Reverend and deare friends, whom I unfaynedly love\r\n     and respect:\r\n\r\n\"It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are\r\nreported day by day of your tyranny and persecutions in New England as\r\nthat you fine, whip and imprison men for their consciences. First, you\r\ncompell such to come to your assemblys as you know will not joyne, and\r\nwhen they show their dislike thereof or witness against it, then you\r\nstirre up your magistrates to punish them for such (as you conseyve)\r\ntheir publicke affronts. Truly, friends, this your practice of\r\ncompelling any in matters of worship to do that whereof they are not\r\nfully persuaded, is to make them sin, for so the apostle (Rom. xiv. 23)\r\ntells, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward\r\nman for feare of punishment. We pray for you and wish you prosperity\r\nevery way; we hoped the Lord would have given you so much light and love\r\nthere, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to\r\npractise those courses in the wilderness, which you went so far to\r\nprevent. These rigid ways have laid you very lowe in the hearts of the\r\nsaints. I do assure you I have heard them pray in the public assemblies\r\nthat the Lord would give you meeke and humble spirits, not to strive so\r\nmuch for uniformity as to keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nAddressed: \"For my reverend and worthyly much esteemed friends, Mr.\r\nCotton and Mr. Wilson, preachers to the Church which is at Boston, in\r\nNew England.\"[106]\r\n\r\nIt is seen that Sir R. Saltonstall's letter was addressed to the two\r\nprincipal Congregational ministers of Boston. It has been shown that the\r\npreachers were the counsellors and prompters of all violent measures\r\nagainst dissenting Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and\r\nQuakers--a fact further illustrated and confirmed by Mr. Bancroft, who,\r\nunder the date of 1650 and 1651, says: \"Nor can it be denied, nor should\r\nit be concealed, that the Elders, especially Wilson and Norton,\r\ninstigated and sustained the Government in its worst cruelties.\"[107]\r\n\r\nDuring this first thirty years of the Massachusetts Bay Government, it\r\nevinced, in contrast with all the other British American colonies,\r\nconstant hostility to the authorities in England, seizing upon every\r\npossible occasion for agitation and dispute; perverting and abusing the\r\nprovisions of the Royal Charter to suppress the worship of the Church of\r\nEngland, and banishing its adherents; setting up a new Church and\r\npersecuting, by whipping, banishment and death, those who refused to\r\nconform to it; seeking its own interests at the expense of the\r\nneighbouring colonies; sacrificing the first principles of civil and\r\nreligious liberty in their legislation and government; basing\r\neligibility to office, and even the elective franchise, upon the\r\ncondition of membership in a Congregational Church--a condition without\r\na precedent or a parallel in any Protestant country.\r\n\r\nI cannot better conclude this review of the first three decades of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Puritan Government, than in the words of the\r\ncelebrated Edmund Burke, who, in his account of the European settlements\r\nin America, after describing the form of government established at\r\nMassachusetts Bay, remarks that: \"From such a form as this, great\r\nreligious freedom might, one would have imagined, be well expected. But\r\nthe truth is, they had no idea at all of such freedom. The very\r\ndoctrine of any sort of toleration was so odious to the greater part,\r\nthat one of the first persecutions set up here was against a small party\r\nwhich arose amongst themselves, who were hardy enough to maintain that\r\nthe civil magistrate had no lawful power to use compulsory measures in\r\naffairs of religion. After harassing these people by all the vexatious\r\nways imaginable, they obliged them to fly out of their jurisdiction.\"\r\n\"If men, merely for the moderation of their sentiments, were exposed to\r\nsuch severe treatment, it was not to be expected that others should\r\nescape unpunished. The very first colony had hardly set its foot in\r\nAmerica, when, discovering that some amongst them were false brethren,\r\nand ventured to make use of the Common Prayer, they found means to make\r\nthe country so uneasy to them, that they were glad to fly back to\r\nEngland. As soon as they began to think of making laws, I find no less\r\nthan five about matters of religion; all contrived, and not only\r\ncontrived, but executed in some respects with a rigour that the\r\npersecution which drove the Puritans out of England, might be considered\r\nlenity and indulgence in the comparison. For, in the first of these\r\nlaws, they deprive every man who does not communicate with their\r\nEstablished Church, of the right to his freedom, or a vote in the\r\nelection of their magistrates. In the second, they sentence to\r\nbanishment any who should oppose the fourth commandment, or deny the\r\nvalidity of infant baptism, or the authority of the magistrates. In the\r\nthird, they condemn Quakers to banishment, and make it capital for them\r\nto return; and not stopping at the offenders, they lay heavy fines upon\r\nall who should bring them into the province, or even harbour them for an\r\nhour. In the fourth, they provide banishment, and death in case of\r\nreturn, for Jesuits and Popish priests of every denomination. In the\r\nfifth, they decree death to any who shall worship images. After they had\r\nprovided such a complete code of persecution, they were not long without\r\nopportunities of reading bloody lectures upon it.\" \"In short, this\r\npeople, who in England could not bear to be chastised with rods, had no\r\nsooner got free from their fetters than they scourged their\r\nfellow-refugees with scorpions; though the absurdity as well as\r\ninjustice of such proceeding in them might stare them in the\r\nface!\"[108]\r\n\r\nMr. Palfrey observes, that \"the death of the Protector is not so much as\r\nreferred to in the public records of Massachusetts.\" If this silence\r\neven as to the fact of Cromwell's death was intended to disclaim having\r\nhad any connection or sympathy with the Protector, it was a deception;\r\nif it was intended as preparatory to renouncing the worship of the\r\nsetting sun of Cromwell, and worshipping the rising sun of Charles the\r\nSecond, it was indeed characteristic of their siding with the stronger\r\nparty, if they could thereby advance their own interests. But I think\r\nevery candid man in this age will admit, that there was much more\r\ndignity of sentiment and conduct of those loyal colonies who adhered to\r\ntheir Sovereign in his adversity as well as in his prosperity, who\r\nsubmitted to compulsory subjection to the Cromwell power without\r\nacknowledging its legitimacy, and were the first to recognize and\r\nproclaim the restored king.[109]\r\n\r\nThe reader will be better able to appreciate the professions of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Government, in regard to the restored king, after\r\nreviewing its professions and relations to the Government of the Long\r\nParliament and of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown above, that when obstinate silence could not prevent\r\nthe inquiry by a Royal Commission into the oppressive and disloyal\r\nproceedings complained of, and that resistance was fruitless, the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Government, September 1638, transmitted to the Lords\r\nCommissioners for the Colonies a petition in which it professed not to\r\nquestion the authority of their Lordships' proceedings, but only to open\r\ntheir griefs; that if they had offended in anything, they prostrated\r\nthemselves at the foot of authority. They begged for time to answer,\r\nbefore condemnation, professed loyalty to the King and prayers for his\r\nlong life, and the happiness of his family, and for the success of the\r\nLords of his Council. Two years after, when the King's power began to\r\nwane, the Massachusetts Bay Government sent home a Commission, headed by\r\nthe notorious Hugh Peters,[110] to conciliate the support of the leading\r\nmembers of the Commons against the King's commission, and to aid the\r\nopposition to the King. In 1644, the General Court of Massachusetts Bay\r\nenacted, \"that what person so ever shall draw a party to the King,\r\nagainst the Parliament, shall be accounted a high offender against this\r\nCommonwealth, and shall be punished capitally.\" (See this Act, quoted at\r\nlarge in a previous page.) This proceeding was as decisive as possible\r\nagainst the King and all who adhered to the monarchy.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Massachusetts General Court's address to Parliament, in\r\n1651, occur the following words:\r\n\r\n\"And for our carriage and demeanour to the honourable Parliament, for\r\nthese _ten years_, since the first beginning of your differences with\r\nthe late king, and the war that after ensued, _we have constantly\r\nadhered to you_, not withdrawing ourselves in your weakest condition and\r\ndoubtfullest times, but by our fasting and prayers for your good\r\nsuccess, and our thanksgiving after the same was attained, in days of\r\nsolemnity set apart for that purpose, _as also by our over-useful men_\r\n(others going voluntarily from us to help you), _who have been of good\r\nuse and done good acceptable service to the army, declaring to the\r\nworld hereby_ that such was the duty and love we bear unto the\r\nParliament that we were ready to rise and fall with them; for which we\r\nhave suffered the hatred and threats of other English colonies, now in\r\nrebellion against you, as also the loss of divers of our ships and\r\ngoods, taken by the King's party that is dead, by others commissioned by\r\nthe King of Scots [Charles II.] and by the Portugalls.\"[111]\r\n\r\nAn address of the same General Court, in the same year, 1651, and on the\r\nsame occasion (against the order of Parliament to recall the old and\r\ngrant the new Charter), to Oliver Cromwell, concludes in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"We humbly petition your Excellence to be pleased to show us what\r\nfavour God shall be pleased to direct you unto on our behalf, to the\r\nmost honourable Parliament, unto whom we have now presented a petition.\r\nThe copy of it, _verbatim_, we are bold to send herewith, that if God\r\nplease, we may not be hindered in our comfortable work of God here in\r\nthis wilderness. Wherein, as for other favours, we shall be bound to\r\npray, that the Captain of the host of Israel may be with you and your\r\nwhole army, in all your great enterprises, to the glory of God, the\r\nsubduing of his and your enemies, and your everlasting peace and comfort\r\nin Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nLikewise, August 24th, 1654, after Cromwell had not only put the King to\r\ndeath, but abolished the House of Lords, excluded by his soldiers 154\r\nmembers of Parliament, then dismissed the remaining \"rump\" of the\r\nParliament itself and become sole despot, the General Court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay concluded an address to him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We shall ever pray the Lord, your protector in all your dangers, that\r\nhath crowned you with honour after your long service, to lengthen your\r\ndays, that you may long continue Lord Protector of the three nations,\r\nand the Churches of Christ Jesus.\"[112]\r\n\r\nThe documentary evidence which I have adduced, shows, I think, beyond\r\nreasonable doubt, that the rulers of Massachusetts Bay Colony were\r\ndisaffected to the King from the beginning, and so displayed that\r\nfeeling on every occasion except one, in 1638, when they professed\r\nhumiliation and loyalty in order to avert the investigation which they\r\ndreaded into their proceedings; that the King, whatever may have been\r\nhis misdoings towards his subjects in England, treated his subjects in\r\nthe colonies, and especially in Massachusetts Bay, with a kindness and\r\nconsideration which should have secured their gratitude; that the\r\nmoment, in the matters of dispute between the King and his Parliament\r\n(and in which the colonies had no concern), the scale appeared to turn\r\nin favour of the Parliament, the rulers of Massachusetts Bay renounced\r\ntheir allegiance to the King, and identified themselves as thorough\r\npartizans of the war against the King--that they suppressed, under the\r\nseverest penalties, every expression of loyalty to the King within their\r\njurisdiction--offered prayers for and furnished men in aid of the\r\nParliamentary army--denounced and proscribed all recognition, except as\r\nenemies, the other American colonies who adhered to their oaths of\r\nallegiance to the King; that when Cromwell had obliterated every\r\nlandmark of the British constitution and of British liberty--King,\r\nLords, and Commons, the freedom of election and the freedom of the\r\npress, with the freedom of worship, and transformed the army itself to\r\nhis sole purpose--doing what no Tudor or Stuart king had ever presumed\r\nto do--even then the General Court of Massachusetts Bay bowed in\r\nreverence and praise before him as the called and chosen of the Lord of\r\nhosts.[113]\r\n\r\nBut when Cromwell could no longer give them, in contempt to the law of\r\nParliament, a monopoly of trade against their fellow-colonists, and\r\nsustain them in their persecutions; when he ceased to live, they would\r\nnot condescend to record his demise, but, after watching for a while the\r\nchances of the future, they turned in adulation to the rising sun of the\r\nrestored Charles the Second.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they adjusted their denials and professions to this\r\nnew state of things, until they prevailed upon the kind-hearted King not\r\nto remember their past transgressions, and to perpetuate their Charter\r\non certain conditions; how they evaded those conditions of toleration\r\nand administering the government, and resumed their old policy of\r\nhostility to the Sovereign and of persecution of their Baptist and other\r\nbrethren who differed from them in worship, and in proscribing them from\r\nthe elective franchise itself, will be treated in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Neal says: \"Certainly never was country more obliged to a\r\nman than New England to Archbishop Laud, who by his cruel and arbitrary\r\nproceedings drove thousands of families out of the kingdom, and thereby\r\nstocked the Plantations with inhabitants, in the compass of a very few\r\nyears, which otherwise could not have been done in an age.\" This was the\r\nsense of some of the greatest men in Parliament in their speeches in\r\n1641. Mr. Tienns (afterwards Lord Hollis) said that \"a certain number of\r\nceremonies in the judgment of some men unlawful, and to be rejected of\r\nall the churches; in the judgment of all other Churches, and in the\r\njudgment of our own Church, but indifferent; yet what difference, yea,\r\nwhat distraction have those indifferent ceremonies raised among us? What\r\nhas deprived us of so many thousands of Christians who desired, and in\r\nall other respects deserved, to hold communion with us? I say what has\r\ndeprived us of them, and scattered them into I know not what places and\r\ncorners of the world, but these indifferent ceremonies.\"--(Several other\r\nspeeches to the same effect are quoted by Neal.)--History of New\r\nEngland, Vol. I., pp. 210-212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: \"Veneris, 10 March, 1642:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the plantations in New England have, by the blessing of the\r\nAlmighty, had good and prosperous success, without any public charge to\r\nthe State, and are now likely to prove very happy for the propagation of\r\nthe gospel in those parts, and very beneficial and commodious to this\r\nnation.

Embarking at\r\nManhattan [for he was not allowed to go to Boston], he arrived in\r\nEngland not long after the death of Hampden. _The Parliament had placed\r\nthe affairs of the American Colonies under the Earl of Warwick, as\r\nGovernor-in-Chief, assisted by a Council of five peers and twelve\r\ncommoners_. Among these commoners was Henry Vane, a man who was ever\r\ntrue in his affections as he was undeviating in his principles, and who\r\nnow welcomed the American envoy as an ancient friend. The favour of\r\nParliament was won by his [Roger Williams'] incomparable 'printed Indian\r\nlabours, the like whereof was not extant from any part of America;' and\r\nhis merits as a missionary induced both houses of Parliament to grant\r\nunto him and friends with him a free and absolute charter[84] of civil\r\ngovernment for those parts of his abode.' Thus were the places of refuge\r\nfor 'soul-liberty' on the Narragansett Bay incorporated 'with full power\r\nand authority to rule themselves.' To the Long Parliament, and\r\nespecially to Sir Harry Vane, Rhode Island owes its existence as a\r\npolitical State.\"--History of the United States, Vol. I., pp. 460, 461.\r\n\r\nThe other allusion of Mr. Bancroft to the Parliamentary Act and\r\nCommission of 1643 is in the following words: \"_The Commissioners\r\nappointed by Parliament, with unlimited authority over the Plantations_,\r\nfound no favour in Virginia. They promised indeed freedom from English\r\ntaxation, but this immunity was already enjoyed. They gave the colony\r\nliberty to choose its own Governor, but it had no dislike to Berkeley;\r\nand though there was a party for the Parliament, yet the King's\r\nauthority was maintained. The sovereignty of Charles had ever been\r\nmildly exercised.\"--_Ib._, p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Hazard, Vol. 1., p. 538; Massachusetts Records. The\r\nworking of this Act, and the punishments inflicted under it for more\r\nthan twenty years, will be seen hereafter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: This is not quite accurate. The word 'absolute' does not\r\noccur in the patent. The words of the Charter are: \"A _free_ Charter of\r\ncivil incorporation and government; that they may order and govern their\r\nPlantations in such a manner as to maintain justice and peace, both\r\namong themselves, and towards all men with whom they shall have to\r\ndo\"--\"Provided nevertheless that the said laws, constitutions, and\r\npunishments, for the civil government of said plantations, be\r\nconformable to the laws of England, so far as the nature and\r\nconstitution of the place will admit.

It empowered him, in conjunction with his\r\nassociates, to examine the state of affairs; to send for papers and\r\npersons, to remove Governors and officers, and appoints other in their\r\nplaces; and to assign over to these such part of the powers that were\r\nnow granted, as he should think proper.\" (Annals of America, Vol. I., p.\r\n273.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 117;\r\nMassachusetts Laws, pp. 140-145.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: \"Mr. Winthrop, who was then Deputy-Governor, was active in\r\nthe prosecution of the petitioners, but the party in favour of them had\r\nso much interest as to obtain a vote to require him to answer in public\r\nto the complaint against him. Dr. Mather says: 'He was most irregularly\r\ncalled forth to an ignominious hearing before a vast assembly, to which,\r\n\"with a sagacious humility,\" he consented, although he showed he might\r\nhave refused it. The result of the hearing was that he was honourably\r\nacquitted,' etc.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: This refers to a sermon preached by Mr. Cotton on a fast\r\nday, an extract of which is published in the Magnalia, B.

Informed of their intention, the magistrates ordered a\r\nseizure of their papers. The searching officers found in their\r\npossession certain memorials to the Commissioners for Plantations,\r\nasking for 'settled Churches according to the (Presbyterian) Reformation\r\nin England;' for the establishment in the colony of the laws of the\r\nrealm; for the appointment of 'a General Governor, or some honourable\r\nCommissioner,' to reform the existing state of things. For this further\r\noffence, such of the prominent conspirators as remained in the country\r\nwere punished by additional fines. Child and Dand were mulcted in the\r\nsum of two hundred pounds; Mauerick, in that of a hundred and fifty\r\npounds; and two others of a hundred pounds each.\"--Palfrey's History of\r\nNew England [Abridged edition], Vol. I., pp. 327, 328.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Mr. Bancroft, referring to the petition of Dr. Child and\r\nothers, quoted on page 94, says: \"The document was written in the spirit\r\nof wanton insult;\" then refers to the case of Gorton, who had appealed\r\nto the Earl of Warwick and the other Parliamentary Commissioners against\r\na judicial decision of the Massachusetts Bay Court in regard to land\r\nclaimed by him. From Mr. Bancroft's statement, it appears that the claim\r\nof Gorton, friendless as he was, was so just as to commend itself to the\r\nfavourable judgment of an impartial and competent tribunal of the\r\nParliamentary Commissioners, whose authority his oppressors expressly\r\ndenied, and then, in their address to Parliament in reference to its\r\norder, denied any authority of Parliament over their proceedings. Mr.\r\nBancroft's words are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gorton had carried his complaints to the Mother Country; and, though\r\nunaided by personal influence or by powerful friends, had succeeded in\r\nall his wishes. At this very juncture an order respecting his claims\r\narrived in Boston; and was couched in terms _which involved an assertion\r\nof the right of Parliament to reverse the decisions and control the\r\nGovernment of Massachusetts_. The danger was imminent; it struck at the\r\nvery life and foundation of the rising Commonwealth. _Had the Long\r\nParliament succeeded in revoking the patent of Massachusetts_, the\r\nStuarts, on their restoration, would have found not one chartered\r\ngovernment in the colonies; and the tenor of American history would have\r\nbeen changed. The people[89] rallied with great unanimity in support of\r\ntheir magistrates.\r\n\r\n\"At length the General Court assembled for the discussion of _the\r\nusurpations of Parliament_ and the _dangers from domestic treachery_.\r\nThe elders [ministers] did not fail to attend in the gloomy season. One\r\nfaithless deputy was desired to withdraw; and then, _with closed doors_,\r\nthat the consultation might remain in the breast of the Court, the\r\n_nature of the relation with England_ was made the subject of debate.\r\nAfter much deliberation it was agreed that Massachusetts owed the same\r\nallegiance to England as the free Hanse Towns had rendered to the\r\nEmpire; as Normandy, when its dukes were kings in England, had paid to\r\nthe monarchs of France. It was also resolved not to accept a new Charter\r\nfrom Parliament, for that would imply a surrender of the old. Besides,\r\nParliament granted none but by way of ordinance, and always made for\r\nitself an express preservation of a supreme power in all things. The\r\n_elders_ (ministers), after a day's consultation, _confirmed the\r\ndecisions_.\r\n\r\n\"The colony proceeded to exercise the _independence_ which it claimed.\r\nThe General Court replied to the petition in a State paper, written with\r\ngreat moderation; and the disturbers of the public security were\r\nsummoned into its presence. Robert Child and his companions appealed to\r\nthe Commissioners in England. _The appeal was not admitted._\" \"To the\r\nParliament of England the Legislature remonstrated with the noblest\r\nfrankness _against any assertion of permanent authority of that\r\nbody_.\"--Hist. U.S., Vol. I., pp. 475-477.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: By the \"people\" here Mr. Bancroft must mean the members of\r\nthe Congregational Churches (one-sixth of the whole population), for\r\nthey alone were _freemen_, and had all the united powers of the\r\nfranchise--the _sword_, the _legislation_--in a word, the whole civil,\r\njudicial, ecclesiastical, and military government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: But Mr. Bancroft seems to forget that in less than forty\r\nyears after this the Charter was revoked, and that very system of\r\ngovernment was established which the General Court of Massachusetts Bay\r\nnow deprecated, but under which Massachusetts itself was most prosperous\r\nand peaceful for more than half a century, until the old spirit was\r\nrevived, which rendered friendly government with England impossible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Mr. Hutchinson says: \"The Earl of Warwick had a patent for\r\nMassachusetts Bay about 1623, but the bounds are not known.\" (History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Mr. Palfrey says: \"While in England the literary war\r\nagainst Presbytery was in great part conducted by American combatants,\r\ntheir attention was presently required at home. William Vassal, a man of\r\nfortune, was one of the original assistants named in the Charter of the\r\nMassachusetts Company. He came to Massachusetts with Winthrop's fleet in\r\nthe great emigration; but for some cause--_possibly from dissatisfaction\r\nwith the tendencies to Separatism which he witnessed_--he almost\r\nimmediately returned. He crossed the sea again five years after, but\r\nthen it was to the colony of Plymouth. Establishing his home at\r\nSeituate, he there conducted himself so as to come under the reproach of\r\nbeing 'a man of a busy, factious spirit, and always opposite to the\r\ncivil government of the country and the way of the Churches.'\"\r\n(Winthrop, II., p. 261.) His disaffection occasioned the more\r\nuneasiness, because his brother Samuel, also formerly an assistant of\r\nthe Massachusetts Company, was now one of the Parliament's Commissioners\r\nfor the government of Foreign Plantations.\r\n\r\nIn the year when the early struggle between the Presbyterians and\r\nIndependents in England had disclosed the importance of the issues\r\ndepending upon it, and the obstinate determination with which it was to\r\nbe carried on, Vassal \"practised with\" a few persons in Massachusetts\r\n\"to take some course, first by petitioning the Courts of Massachusetts\r\nand of Plymouth, _and if that succeeded not_, then to the Parliament of\r\nEngland, that the distinctions which were maintained here, both in civil\r\nand church state, might be done away, and that we might be wholly\r\ngoverned by the laws of England.\" In [93] a \"Remonstrance and Humble\r\nPetition,\" addressed by them to the General Court [of Massachusetts],\r\nthey represented--1. That they could not discern in that colony \"a\r\nsettled form of government according to the laws of England;\" 2. That\r\n\"many thousands in the plantation of the English nation were debarred\r\nfrom civil employments,\" and not permitted \"so much as to have any vote\r\nin choosing magistrates, captains, or other civil and military\r\nofficers;\" and, 3. \"That numerous members of the Church of England,...\r\nnot dissenting from the latest reformation in England, Scotland, etc.,\r\nwere detained from the seals of the covenant of free grace, as it was\r\nsupposed they will not take these Churches' covenants.\" They prayed for\r\nrelief from each of these grievances; and they gave notice that, if it\r\nwere denied, they should \"be necessitated to apply their humble desires\r\nto the honourable Houses of Parliament, who, they hoped, would take\r\ntheir sad condition into their serious consideration.\"\r\n\r\nAfter describing the social position of the representative petitioners,\r\nMr. Palfrey proceeds: \"But however little importance the movement\r\nderived from the character or position of the agitators, it was\r\nessentially of a nature to create alarm. It proposed nothing less than\r\nan abandonment of institutions, civil and ecclesiastical, which the\r\nsettlers and owners of Massachusetts had set up, for reasons impressing\r\ntheir own minds as of the greatest significance and cogency. The demand\r\nwas enforced by considerations which were not without plausibility, and\r\nwere presented in a seductive form. _It was itself an appeal to the\r\ndiscontent of the numerical majority, not invested with a share in the\r\ngovernment._ And it frankly threatened an appeal to the English\r\nParliament--an authority always to be dreaded, for encroachment on\r\ncolonial rights, and especially to be dreaded at a moment when the more\r\nnumerous party among its members were bent on setting up a Presbytery as\r\nthe established religion of England and its dependencies, determined on\r\na severe suppression of dissent from it, and keenly exasperated against\r\nthat Independency which New England had raised up to torment them in\r\ntheir own sphere, and which, for herself, New England cherished as her\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"It being understood that two of the remonstrants, Fowle and Smith, were\r\nabout to embark for England, to prosecute their business, the Court\r\nstopped them with a summons to appear and 'answer _to the matter of the\r\npetition_.' They replied 'to the Gentlemen Commissioners for\r\nPlantations;' and the Court committed them to the custody of the Marshal\r\ntill they gave security to be responsible to the judgment of the Court.\r\nThe whole seven were next arraigned as authors of divers false and\r\nscandalous statements in a certain paper ... against the Churches of\r\nChrist and the civil government here established, derogating from the\r\nhonour and authority of the same, and tending to sedition. Refusing to\r\nanswer, and 'appealing from this government, they disclaimed the\r\njurisdiction thereof.' This was more than Presbyterian malcontents could\r\nbe indulged in at the present critical time in Massachusetts. The Court\r\nfound them all deeply blamable, and punished them by fines, which were\r\nto be remitted on their making 'an ingenuous and public acknowledgment\r\nof their misdemeanours;' a condition of indemnity which they all\r\nrefused, probably in expectation of obtaining both relief and applause\r\nin England.\"--\"Four deputies opposed the sentence; three\r\nmagistrates--Bellingham, Saltonstall, and Bradstreet--also\r\ndissented.\"--Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. I., pp. 166-170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Winthrop, II., 261. \"The movement in Plymouth was made at\r\na General Court in October, 1645, as appears from a letter of Winslow to\r\nWinthrop (Hutchinson's Collection, 154); though the public record\r\ncontains nothing respecting it. I infer from Winslow's letter, that half\r\nthe assistants (namely, Standish, Hatherly, Brown, and Freeman) were in\r\nfavour of larger indulgence to the malcontents.\" (Note by Mr. Palfrey.)\r\n\r\n(The majority of the General Court were clearly in favour of the\r\nmovement; and knowing this, the Governor, Prince (the only persecuting\r\nGovernor of the Plymouth Colony), refused to put the question to vote.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., Chap.\r\nv., p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: History of New England, Vol. II. p. 169. In another case\r\nmentioned by Mr. Palfrey, it is clear the public feeling was not with\r\nthe local Government, which pretended to absolute independence of\r\nParliament, and called the entrance of a parliamentary war vessel into\r\nits harbour, and action there, a \"_foreign_ encroachment.\" A Captain\r\nStagg arrived at Boston from London, in a vessel carrying twenty-four\r\nguns, and found there a merchant vessel from Bristol (which city was\r\nthen held for the King), which he seized. Governor Winthrop wrote to\r\nCaptain Stagg \"to know _by what authority_ he had done it in _our_\r\nharbour.\" Stagg produced his commission from the Earl of Warwick to\r\ncapture vessels from ports in the occupation of the King's party, as\r\nwell in harbours and creeks as on the high seas. Winthrop ordered him to\r\ncarry the paper to Salem, the place of the Governor's residence, there\r\nto be considered at a meeting of the magistrates. _Of course the public\r\nfeeling was with the Parliament and its officers_; but it was not so\r\nheedless as to forget its jealousy of _foreign encroachment_ from\r\nwhatever quarter. \"Some of the elders, the last Lord's Day, had in their\r\nsermons reproved this proceeding, and exhorted magistrates to maintain\r\nthe people's liberties, which were, they said, _violated by this act_,\r\nand that a commission could not supersede a patent. And at this meeting\r\nsome of the magistrates and some of the elders were of the same opinion,\r\nand that the captain should be forced to restore the ship.\" The\r\ndecision, however, was different; and the reasons for _declining to defy\r\nthe Parliament_, and allowing its officer to retain possession of his\r\nprize, are recorded. The following are passages of this significant\r\nmanifesto: \"This could be no precedent to bar us from opposing any\r\ncommission or other foreign power that might indeed tend to our hurt or\r\nviolate our liberty; for the Parliament had taught us that _salus\r\npopuli_ is _suprema lex_.\"[96] \"If Parliament should hereafter be of a\r\nmalignant spirit, then, _if we have strength sufficient_, we may make\r\nuse of _salus populi_ to withstand any authority from thence to our\r\nhurt.\" \"If we who have so openly declared our affection to the cause of\r\nParliament by our prayers, fastings, etc., should now oppose their\r\nauthority, or do anything that would make such an appearance, it would\r\nbe laid hold on by those in Virginia and the West Indies to confirm them\r\nin their rebellious course, and it would grieve all our godly friends in\r\nEngland, or any other of the Parliament's friends.\"--Palfrey's History\r\nof New England, Vol. II., pp. 161-163.\r\n\r\nNote.--It is plain from these words, as well as from other words quoted\r\nelsewhere, how entirely and avowedly the Massachusetts Court identified\r\nthemselves with the Parliament and Cromwell against the King, though\r\nthey denied having done so in their addresses to Charles the Second.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: This maxim, that _the safety of the people is the supreme\r\nlaw_, might, by a similar perversion, be claimed by any mob or party\r\nconstituting the majority of a city, town, or neighbourhood, as well as\r\nby the Colony of Massachusetts, against the Parliament or supreme\r\nauthority of the nation. They had no doubt of their own infallibility;\r\nthey had no fear that they \"should hereafter be of a malignant spirit;\"\r\nbut they thought it very possible that the Parliament might be so, and\r\nthen it would be for them to fight if they should have \"strength\r\nsufficient.\" But after the restoration they thought it not well to face\r\nthe armies and fleets of Charles the Second, and made as humble, as\r\nloyal, and as laudatory professions to him--calling him \"the best of\r\nkings\"--as they had made to Cromwell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: They say: \"Receiving information by Mr. Winslow, our\r\nagent, that it is the Parliament's pleasure that we should take a new\r\npatent from them, and keep our Courts and issue our warrants in their\r\nnames, which we have not used in the late King's time or since, not\r\nbeing able to discern the need of such an injunction,--these things make\r\nus doubt and fear what is intended towards us. Let it therefore please\r\nyou, most honourable, we humbly entreat, to take notice hereby what were\r\nour orders, upon what conditions and with what authority we came hither,\r\nand what we have done since our coming.

About three or four and\r\ntwenty years since, seeing just cause to fear the persecution of the\r\nthen Bishops and High Commissioners for not conforming to the ceremonies\r\nthen pressed upon the consciences of those under their power, we thought\r\nit our safest course to get to this outside of the world, out of their\r\nview and beyond their reach. Yet before we resolved upon so great an\r\nundertaking, wherein should be hazarded not only all our estates, but\r\nalso the lives of ourselves and our posterity, both in the voyage at sea\r\n(wherewith we were unacquainted), and in coming into a wilderness\r\nuninhabited (unless in some few places by heathen, barbarous Indians),\r\nwe thought it necessary to procure a patent from the late King, who then\r\nruled all, to warrant our removal and prevent future inconveniences, and\r\nso did. By which patent liberty and power was granted to us to live\r\nunder the government of a Governor, magistrates of our own choosing, and\r\nunder laws of our own making (not being repugnant to the laws of\r\nEngland), according to which patent we have governed ourselves above\r\nthis twenty years, we coming hither at our proper charges, without the\r\nhelp of the State, an acknowledgment of the freedom of our goods from\r\ncustom,\" etc. \"And for our carriage and demeanour to the honourable\r\nParliament, for these ten years, since the first beginning of your\r\ndifferences with the late King, and the war that after ensued, we have\r\nconstantly adhered to you, not withdrawing ourselves in your weakest\r\ncondition and doubtfullest times, but by our fasting and prayers for\r\nyour good success, and our thanksgiving after the same was attained, in\r\ndays of solemnity set apart for that purpose, as also by our sending\r\nover useful men (others also going voluntarily from us to help you), who\r\nhave been of good use and done acceptable services to the army,\r\ndeclaring to the world hereby that such was the duty and love we bear\r\nunto the Parliament, that we were ready to rise and fall with them; for\r\nwhich we have suffered the hatred and threats of other English colonies\r\nnow in rebellion against you, as also the loss of divers of our ships\r\nand goods, taken by the King's party that is dead, by others\r\ncommissioned by the King of Scots [Charles II.], and by the Portugalls.\"\r\n\"We hope that this most honourable Parliament will not cast such as have\r\nadhered to you and depended upon you, as we have done, into so deep\r\ndespair, from the fear of which we humbly desire to be speedily freed by\r\na just and gracious answer; which will freshly bind us to pray and use\r\nall lawful endeavours for the blessing of God upon you and the present\r\nGovernment.\" Appendix viii. to the first volume of Hutchinson's History\r\nof Massachusetts Bay, pp. 516-518.\r\n\r\nThe \"General Court\" also sent a letter to Oliver Cromwell, enclosing a\r\ncopy of the petition to Parliament, to counteract representations which\r\nmight be made against them by their enemies, and intreat his interest in\r\ntheir behalf. This letter concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We humbly petition your Excellence to be pleased to shew us what favour\r\nGod shall be pleased to direct you unto on our behalf, to the most\r\nhonourable Parliament, unto whom we have now presented a petition. The\r\ncopy of it, _verbatim_, we are bold to send herewith, that, if God so\r\nplease, we be not hindered in our comfortable proceedings in the work of\r\nGod here in this wilderness. Wherein, as for other favours, we shall be\r\nbound to pray, that the Captain of the Host of Israel may be with you\r\nand your whole army, in all your great enterprises, to the glory of God,\r\nthe subduing of his and your enemies, and your everlasting peace and\r\ncomfort in Jesus Christ.\" (_Ib._, Appendix ix., p. 522.)\r\n\r\nIn August (24th), 1654, the General Court addressed another letter to\r\nOliver Cromwell, commencing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It hath been no small comfort to us poor exiles, in these utmost ends\r\nof the earth (who sometimes felt and often feared the frowns of the\r\nmighty), to have had the experience of the good hand of God, in raising\r\nup such, whose endeavours have not been wanting to our welfare: amongst\r\nwhom we have good cause to give your Highness the first place: who by a\r\ncontinued series of favours, have oblidged us, not only while you moved\r\nin a lower orb, but since the Lord hath called your Highness to supreme\r\nauthority, whereat we rejoice and shall pray for the continuance of your\r\nhappy government, that under your shadow not only ourselves, but all the\r\nChurches, may find rest and peace.\" (_Ib._, Appendix x., p. 523.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: \"1651.--The Parliament of England passed the famous Act of\r\nNavigation. It had been observed with concern, that the English\r\nmerchants for several years past had usually freighted the Hollanders'\r\nshipping for bringing home their own merchandise, because their freight\r\nwas at a lower rate than that of the English ships. For the same reason\r\nthe Dutch ships were made use of even for importing American products\r\nfrom the English colonies into England. The English ships meanwhile lay\r\nrotting in the harbours, and the English mariners, for want of\r\nemployment, went into the service of the Hollanders. The Commonwealth\r\nnow turned its attention towards the most effectual mode of retaining\r\nthe colonies in dependence on the parent State, and of securing to it\r\nthe benefits of their increasing commerce. With these views the\r\nParliament enacted, 'That no merchandise, either of Asia, Africa, or\r\nAmerica, including the English Plantations there, should be imported\r\ninto England in any but English-built ships, and belonging either to\r\nEnglish or English Plantation subjects, navigated also by an English\r\ncommander, and three-fourths of the sailors to be Englishmen; excepting\r\nsuch merchandise as should be imported directly from the original place\r\nof their growth, manufactured in Europe solely: and that no fish should\r\nthenceforward be imported into England or Ireland, nor exported thence\r\nto foreign parts, nor even from one of their own ports, but what should\r\nbe caught by their own fishers only.\" (Holmes' Annals of America,\r\nAnderson, ii., 415, 416; Robertson, B. 9, p. 303; Janes' edit. Vol. I.,\r\np. 294.) Mr. Holmes adds in a note: \"This Act was evaded at first by New\r\nEngland, which still traded to all parts, and enjoyed a privilege\r\npeculiar to themselves of importing their goods into England free of\r\ncustoms.\" (History Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 40.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. II., p. 393.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. II., p. 397, in a\r\nnote.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p.\r\n152; Holmes' Annuls, Vol. I., p. 294.

Two years\r\nbefore, shortly after Governor Winthrop's death, Governor Endicot, with\r\nseveral other magistrates, issued a declaration against men wearing long\r\nhair, prefaced with the words, \"Forasmuch as the wearing of long hair,\r\nafter the manner of the ruffians and barbarous Indians, has begun to\r\ninvade New England,\" and declaring \"their dislike and detestation\r\nagainst wearing of such long hair as a thing uncivil and unmanly,\r\nwhereby men do deform themselves, and offend sober and modest men, and\r\ndo corrupt good manners,\" etc.--_Ib._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Such was the opinion of the late Mr. John Forster, in his\r\nbeautiful Life of Sir Henry Vane, in his Lives of the Puritan Statesmen\r\nof the Commonwealth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Hutchinson's Collection of Original Papers, etc.;\r\nPublication of the Prince Society.\r\n\r\n_Note_ by Mr. Hutchinson: \"Mr. Winthrop had obliged Mr. Vane to leave\r\nMassachusetts and return to England.

As they were worshipping God in their own way on a Lord's-day\r\nmorning, the constable took them into custody. Next morning they were\r\nbrought before the magistrate of the town, who sent them in custody to\r\nBoston, where they remained in prison a fortnight, when they were\r\nbrought to trial, convicted and fined: John Clarke, twenty pounds or to\r\nbe well whipped; John Crandall, five pounds or to be whipped; Obadiah\r\nHolmes, thirty pounds for several offences.\" Mr. Neal adds: \"The\r\nprisoners agreed not to pay their fines but to abide the corporal\r\npunishment the Court had sentenced them to; but some of Mr. Clarke's\r\nfriends paid the fine without his consent; and Crandall was released\r\nupon the promise to appear at the next Court; but Holmes received thirty\r\nlashes at the whipping-post. Several of his friends were spectators of\r\nhis punishment; among the rest John Spear and John Hazell, who, as they\r\nwere attending the prisoner back to prison, took him by the hand in the\r\nmarket-place, and, in the face of all the people, praised God for his\r\ncourage and constancy; for which they were summoned before the General\r\nCourt the next day, and were fined each of them forty shillings, or to\r\nbe whipped. The prisoners refused to pay the money, but some of their\r\nfriends paid it for them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neal adds the following just and impressive remarks: \"_Thus the\r\nGovernment of New England, for the sake of uniformity in divine worship,\r\nbroke in upon the natural rights of mankind, punishing men, not for\r\ndisturbing the State, but for their different sentiments in religion_,\r\nas appears by the following Law:\" [Then Mr. Neal quotes the law passed\r\nagainst the Baptists seven years before, in 1644, and given on page 92.]\r\n(Neal's History of New England, Vol. I., pp. 299, 300, 302, 303.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Hutchinson's Collection of State Papers, etc., pp. 401,\r\n402.\r\n\r\nMr. Cotton wrote a long letter in reply to Sir R. Saltonstall, denying\r\nthat he or Mr. Wilson had instigated the complaints against the\r\nBaptists, yet representing them as _profane_ because they did not attend\r\nthe established worship, though they worshipped God in their own way.\r\nCotton, assuming that the Baptist worship was no worship, and that the\r\nonly lawful worship was the Congregational, proceeds to defend\r\ncompulsory attendance at the established worship upon the ground of\r\npreventing Sabbath profaneness (which was a perversion of Sir R.\r\nSaltonstall's letter), the same as compulsory attendance at the\r\nestablished worship was justified in the time of Elizabeth and James the\r\nFirst, and against which the whole army of Puritan writers had\r\ncontended. Some of Cotton's words were as follows: \"But (you say) it\r\ndoth make men hypocrites to compel men to conforme the outward men for\r\nfear of punishment. If it did so, yet better be hypocrites than profane\r\npersons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man; but the\r\nprofane person giveth God neither the outward or inward man.\"--\"If the\r\nmagistrate connive at his absenting himself from the Sabbath duties, the\r\nsin will be greater in the magistrate than can be the other's coming.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchinson, referring to Sir R. Saltonstall's letter, says:--\"It\r\ndiscovers a good deal of that catholic spirit which too many of our\r\nfirst settlers were destitute of, and confirms what I have said of Mr.\r\nDudley's zeal in the first volume of the Massachusetts History.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: History of the United States, Vol. I., p. 484.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" says Mr. Bancroft, \"that the elder Winthrop had relented\r\nbefore his death, and, it is said, became weary of banishing heretics.\r\nThe soul of the younger Winthrop was incapable of harbouring a thought\r\nof intolerant cruelty; but the rugged Dudley was not mellowed by old\r\nage.\" Cotton affirmed: \"Better tolerate hypocrites and tares than thorns\r\nand briers.\" \"Religion,\" said Norton, from the pulpit, \"admits of no\r\neccentric motions.\" (_Ib._, pp. 486, 487.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Burke, Vol. II., Second London Edition, 1758, pp.\r\n148-152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: \"In October, 1650, the Commons passed a memorable\r\nordinance, prohibiting trade with Barbadoes, Virginia, Antigua, and the\r\nBermudas, because they had adhered to the fortunes of their late\r\nSovereign. It declared such persons 'notorious robbers and traitors;' it\r\nforbade every one to confederate with them; it prohibited all foreign\r\nvessels from sailing thither, and it empowered the Council of State to\r\ncompel all opponents to obey the authority of Parliament. Berkley's\r\ndefence of Virginia against the fortunate invaders gained him the\r\napprobation of his prince and the applause of his countrymen. When he\r\ncould no longer fight, he delivered up the government, upon such\r\nfavourable terms as the English Commissioners were willing to grant. He\r\nretired to a private station, to wait with patience for favourable\r\nevents. Virginia changed the various rulers which the revolutions of the\r\nage imposed on England, with the reluctance that acknowledged usurpation\r\ngenerally incites. But with the distractions that succeeded the death of\r\nCromwell, she seized the opportunity to free herself from the dominion\r\nof her hated masters by recalling Berkley from his obscurity, and\r\nproclaiming the exiled king; and she by this means acquired the\r\nunrivalled honour of being the last dominion of the State which\r\nsubmitted to that unjust exercise of government, and the first which\r\noverturned it.\"--Chalmers' History of the Revolt of the American\r\nColonies, Vol. I., pp. 74, 75 (Boston Collection).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: It was proved on Hugh Peters' trial, twenty years\r\nafterwards, that he had said his work, out of New England, was, \"to\r\npromote the interest of the Reformation, _by stirring up the war and\r\ndriving it on_.\" He was Cromwell's favourite chaplain, and preached\r\nbefore the Court that tried King Charles I., urging the condemnation and\r\nexecution of the King.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I.,\r\nAppendix viii., pp. 517, 518.\r\n\r\n\"The 'other English Colonies' with which Massachusetts, by her\r\nattachment to the new Government, had been brought into unfriendly\r\nrelations, were 'Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermudas, and Antigua.' Their\r\npersistent loyalty had been punished by an ordinance of Parliament\r\nforbidding Englishmen to trade with them--a measure which the General\r\nCourt of Massachusetts seconded by a similar prohibition addressed to\r\nmasters of vessels belonging to that jurisdiction. The rule was to\r\nremain in force 'until the compliance of the aforesaid places with the\r\nCommonwealth of England, or the further order of this Court;' and the\r\npenalty of disobedience was to be a confiscation of ship and cargo. In\r\nrespect to Virginia, it may be presumed that this step was not the less\r\nwillingly taken, on account of a grudge of some years' standing.

The Virginia\r\nLegislature, while it established the Episcopal Church, had never, like\r\nthe Legislature of Massachusetts Bay, disqualified all except the\r\nmembers of one Church from either holding office or exercising the\r\nelective franchise. The Massachusetts Bay Government, like that of the\r\nPapacy, would tolerate only their own form of worship; would allow no\r\nEpiscopalian, Presbyterian, or Baptist worship within their\r\njurisdiction; yet complain of and resent it as unjust and persecuting\r\nwhen they are not permitted to propagate their system in other colonies\r\nor countries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I.,\r\nAppendix ix., p. 522.\r\n\r\nTo these extraordinary addresses may be added a letter from the Rev.\r\nJohn Cotton, a chief Congregational minister in Boston, to \"Lord General\r\nCromwell,\" dated Boston, N.E., May 5th, 1651.\r\n\r\nThere are three things in this letter to be specially noticed.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ is, the terms in which Cromwell is addressed and\r\ncomplimented.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ is, the indication here given of the manner in which the\r\nScotch prisoners taken at the battle of Dunbar (while fighting in their\r\nown country and for their King) were disposed of by Cromwell, and with\r\nwhat complacency Mr. Cotton speaks of the slavery into which they were\r\nsold not being \"perpetual servitude,\" but limited to \"6 or 7, or 8\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe _third_ thing noteworthy in this letter, in which Mr. Cotton\r\ncompliments Cromwell for having cashiered from the army every one but\r\nhis own partizans, thus placing the army beneath his feet, to support\r\nhis absolutism in the State, having extinguished the Parliament itself,\r\nand with it every form of liberty dear to the hearts of all true\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nThe chief passages of Mr. Cotton's letter are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Right Honourable,--For so I must acknowledge you, not only for the\r\neminency of place and command to which the God of power and honour hath\r\ncalled you; but also for that the Lord hath set you forth as a vessell\r\nof honour to his name, in working many and great deliverances for his\r\npeople, and for his truth, by you; and yet helping you to reserve all\r\nthe honour to him, who is the God of salvation and the Lord of hosts,\r\nmighty in battell.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Scots, whom God delivered into your hand at Dunbarre, and whereof\r\nsundry were sent hither, we have been desirous (as we could) to make\r\ntheir yoke easy. Such as were sick of the scurvy or other diseases have\r\nnot wanted physick or chyrurgery. They have not been sold for slaves to\r\nperpetual servitude, but for 6 or 7, or 8 years, as we do our owne: and\r\nhe that bought the most of them (I heare) buildeth houses for them, for\r\nevery 4 an house, layeth some acres of ground thereto, which he giveth\r\nthem as their owne, requiring three dayes in the weeke to worke for him\r\n(by turnes), and 4 dayes for themselves, and promiseth, as soon as they\r\ncan repay him the money he layed out for them, he will set them at\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the aspersion of factious men, I hear, by Mr. Desborough's\r\nletter [Cromwell's brother-in-law], last night, that you have well\r\nvindicated yourselfe therefrom _by cashiering sundry corrupt spirits_\r\nout of the army.

The addresses to the\r\nParliament and Cromwell show this to have been the case.\"--History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 209.\r\n\r\nThe addresses to Parliament and to Cromwell prove the very\r\nreverse--prove that the rulers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony avowedly\r\nidentified themselves with the Parliament and afterwards with Cromwell,\r\nwhen he overthrew the Parliament, and even when he manipulated the army\r\nto his purpose of absolutism.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY AND OTHER COLONIES, DURING TWENTY YEARS,\r\nUNDER CHARLES THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe restoration of Charles the Second to the throne of his ancestors was\r\nreceived in the several American colonies with very different feelings;\r\nthe loyal colonies, from the Bermudas to Plymouth, hailed and proclaimed\r\nthe restored King without hesitation; Virginia proclaimed him before he\r\nwas proclaimed in England;[114] the rulers of the Massachusetts Bay\r\nColony alone stood in suspense; hesitated, refused to proclaim him for a\r\nyear, until ordered to do so. When it was ascertained that the\r\nrestoration of the King, Lords, and Commons had been enthusiastically\r\nratified by the people of England, and was firmly established, the\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts Bay adopted a most loyal address to the\r\nKing, and another to the two Houses of Parliament, notwithstanding the\r\nsame Court had shortly before lauded the power which had abolished King,\r\nLords, and Commons. The Court also thought it needful to give practical\r\nproof of the sincerity of their new-born loyalty to the monarchical\r\ngovernment by condemning a book published ten years before, and which\r\nhad been until now in high repute among them, written by the Rev. John\r\nEliot, the famous apostle to the Indians. This book was entitled \"The\r\nChristian Commonwealth,\" and argued that a purely republican government\r\nwas the only Christian government, and that all the monarchical\r\ngovernments of Europe, especially that of England, was anti-Christian.\r\nIt appears that this book had been adduced by the complainants in\r\nEngland against the Massachusetts Bay Government as a proof of their\r\nhostility to the system of government now restored in England. To purge\r\nthemselves from this charge, the Governor and Council of Massachusetts\r\nBay, March 18, 1661, took this book into consideration, and declared\r\n\"they find it, on perusal, full of seditious principles and notions\r\nrelative to all established governments in the Christian world,\r\nespecially against the government established in their native country.\"\r\nUpon consultation with the Elders, their censure was deferred until the\r\nGeneral Court met, \"that Mr. Eliot might have the opportunity in the\r\nmeantime of public recantation.\" At the next sessions, in May, Mr. Eliot\r\ngave into the Court the following acknowledgment under his hand:\r\n\r\n\"Understanding by an Act of the honoured Council, that there is offence\r\ntaken at a book published in England by others, the copy whereof was\r\nsent over by myself about nine or ten years since, and that the further\r\nconsideration thereof is commended to this honoured Court now sitting in\r\nBoston: Upon perusal thereof, I do judge myself to have offended, and in\r\nway of satisfaction not only to the authority of this jurisdiction, but\r\nalso to any others that shall take notice thereof, I do hereby\r\nacknowledge to this General Court, that such expressions as do too\r\nmanifestly scandalize the Government of England, by King, Lords and\r\nCommons, as anti-christian, and justify the late innovators, I do\r\nsincerely bear testimony against, and acknowledge it to be not only a\r\nlawful but eminent form of government.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. All forms of civil government, deduced from Scripture, I\r\nacknowledge to be of God, and to be subscribed to for conscience sake;\r\nand whatsoever is in the whole epistle or book inconsistent herewith, I\r\ndo at once and most cordially disown.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN ELIOT.\"[115]\r\n\r\nIt must have been painful and humiliating to John Eliot to be brought to\r\naccount for and compelled to recant the sentiments of a book which had\r\nbeen in circulation eight or nine years, and much applauded by those who\r\nnow arraigned and made a scapegoat of him, to avert from themselves the\r\nconsequence and suspicion of sentiments which they had held and avowed\r\nas strongly as Eliot himself.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Government of Massachusetts Bay had desisted\r\nfrom acknowledging and addressing Charles the Second as King, until they\r\nfound that their silence endangered their interests. Mr. Holmes, in his\r\nAnnals, speaking under the date of May, 1661 (a year after Charles had\r\nentered London as King), says: \"Charles II., had not yet been proclaimed\r\nby the colony. The Governor (Endicot), on receiving intelligence of the\r\ntransactions that were taking place in England to the prejudice of the\r\ncolony, judged it inexpedient longer to delay that solemnity. Calling\r\nthe Court together, a form of proclamation was agreed to, and Charles\r\nwas acknowledged to be their sovereign Lord, and proclaimed to be the\r\nlawful King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and all other\r\nterritories thereto belonging.\" An address to the King was agreed to,\r\nand ordered to be sent to England.[116]\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable address (given in a note) the reader will be struck\r\nwith several things which appear hardly reconcilable with words of\r\nsincerity and truth.\r\n\r\nFirst, the reason professed for delaying nearly a year to recognise and\r\naddress the King after his restoration. Nearly thirty years before, they\r\nhad threatened the King's Royal father with resistance, since which time\r\nthey had greatly increased in wealth and population; but now they\r\nrepresent themselves as \"poor exiles,\" and excuse themselves for not\r\nacknowledging the King because of their Mephiboseth lameness of\r\ndistance--as if they were more distant from England than the other\r\nAmerican colonies. Their \"lameness\" and \"ineptness\" and \"impotence\"\r\nplainly arose from disinclination alone. It is amusing to hear them\r\nspeak of themselves as \"exanimated outcasts,\" hoping to be animated by\r\nthe breath of Royal favour. Their \"script\" was no doubt \"the transcript\r\nof their loyal hearts\" when they supplicated the continuance of the\r\nRoyal Charter, the first intentions and essential provisions of which\r\nthey had violated so many years.\r\n\r\nSecondly. But what is most suspicious in this address is their denial of\r\nhaving taken any part in the civil war in England--professing that their\r\nlot had been the good old nonconformists',[117] \"only to act a passive\r\n_part_ throughout these late vicissitudes,\" and ascribed to the favour\r\nof God their \"exemption from the temptations of _either party_.\" Now,\r\njust ten years before, in their address to the Long Parliament and to\r\nCromwell, they said:\r\n\r\n\"And for our carriage and demeanour to the honourable Parliament for\r\nthese ten years, since the first beginning of your differences with the\r\nlate King, and the war that after ensued, we have constantly adhered to\r\nyou, notwithstanding ourselves in your weakest condition and\r\ndoubtfullest times, but by our fasting and prayers for your good\r\nsuccess, and our thanksgiving after the same was attained, in days of\r\nsolemnity set apart for that purpose, as also by our sending over useful\r\nmen (others also going voluntarily from us to help you) who have been of\r\ngood use and have done good acceptable service to the army, declaring to\r\nthe world hereby that such was the duty and love we bear unto the\r\nParliament that we were ready to rise and fall with them: for which we\r\nsuffered the hatred and threats of other English colonies now in\r\nrebellion against you,\" etc.[118]\r\n\r\nWhether this address to Parliament (a copy of it being enclosed with an\r\naddress to Cromwell) had ever at that time been made public, or whether\r\nKing Charles the Second had then seen it, does not appear; but it is not\r\neasy to conceive statements and words more opposite than those addressed\r\nby the General Court of Massachusetts Bay to the Parliament in 1651, and\r\nto the King, Charles the Second, in 1661.\r\n\r\nOn the contrasts of acts themselves, the reader will make his own\r\nremarks and inferences. The King received and answered their address\r\nvery graciously.[119] They professed to receive it gratefully; but their\r\nconsciousness of past unfaithfulness and transgressions, and their\r\njealous suspicions, apprehended evil from the general terms of the\r\nKing's reply, his reference to his Royal predecessors and religious\r\nliberty, which above all things they most dreaded, desiring religious\r\nliberty for themselves alone, but not for any Episcopalian,\r\nPresbyterian, Baptist, or Quaker. They seem, however, to have been\r\nsurprised at the kindness of the King's answer, considering their former\r\nconduct towards him and his Royal father, and towards the colonies that\r\nloyally adhered to their King; and professed to have been excited to an\r\necstasy of inexpressible delight and gratitude at the gracious words of\r\nthe best of kings.[120] Their address presented a curious mixture of\r\nprofessed self-abasement, weakness, isolation, and affliction, with\r\nfulsome adulation not surpassed by anything that could have been indited\r\nby the most devout loyalist. But this honeymoon of adulation to the\r\nrestored King was not of long duration; the order of the King, September\r\n8, 1661, to cease persecuting the Quakers, was received and submitted to\r\nwith remonstrance; and obedience to it was refused as far as sending the\r\naccused Quakers to England for trial, as that would bring the Government\r\nof Massachusetts Bay before the English tribunals.[121]\r\n\r\nBut petitions and representations poured in upon the King and Council\r\nfrom Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, etc., from Massachusetts\r\nBay, and their friends in England, complaining that they were denied\r\nliberty of worship, the ordinance of Baptism and the Lord's Supper to\r\ntheir families and themselves, that they were deprived of even the\r\nelective franchise because of their not being members of the\r\nCongregational Church, and praying for the redress of their\r\ngrievances.[122]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the colony had, however, warm and influential advocates\r\nin the Council of the King: the Earl of Manchester, formerly commander\r\nof the Parliamentary army against Charles the First, until supplanted by\r\nCromwell; Lord Say, a chief founder of Connecticut; and Mr. Morrice,\r\nSecretary--all Puritans.[123] Under these influences the King sent a\r\nletter to the colony, which had been avowedly at war in connection with\r\nCromwell, against his royal father and himself (and by which they had\r\njustly forfeited the Charter, apart from other violations of it),\r\npardoning the past and assuring them he would not cancel but restore and\r\nestablish their Charter, provided they would fulfil certain conditions\r\nwhich were specified. They joyously accepted the pardon of the past, and\r\nthe promised continuance of the Charter as if unconditional, without\r\nfulfilling the conditions of it, or even mentioning them; just as their\r\nfathers had claimed the power given them in the Royal Charter by Charles\r\nthe First in 1628, to make laws and regulations for order and good\r\ngovernment of the Massachusetts Bay Plantation, concealing the Charter,\r\nclaiming absolute power under it, and wholly ignoring the restrictive\r\ncondition that such laws and regulations were not to be \"contrary to the\r\nlaws of England\"--not only concealing the Charter, but not allowing\r\ntheir laws and regulations to be printed until after the fall of Charles\r\nthe First, and resisting all orders for the production of their\r\nproceedings, and all Commissions of Inquiry to ascertain whether they\r\nhad not made laws or regulations and performed acts \"contrary to the\r\nlaws of England.\" So now, a generation afterwards, they claimed and\r\ncontended that Charles the Second had restored their Charter, as if done\r\nabsolutely and unconditionally without their recognising one of the five\r\nconditions included in the proviso of the King's letter. Nothing could\r\nhave been more kindly and generously conceived than the terms of the\r\nKing's letter, and nothing could be more reasonable than the conditions\r\ncontained in its proviso--conditions with which all the other British\r\ncolonies of America readily complied, and which every province of the\r\nDominion of Canada has assumed and acted upon as a duty and pleasure\r\nfrom the first establishment of their respective Governments. Of all the\r\ncolonies of the British Empire for the last three centuries, that of\r\nMassachusetts Bay is the only one that ever refused to acknowledge this\r\nallegiance to the Government from which it derived its existence and\r\nterritory. The conditions which Charles the Second announced as the\r\nproviso of his consenting to renew and continue the Charter granted by\r\nhis Royal father to the Company of Massachusetts Bay, were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"1. That upon a review, all such laws and ordinances that are now, or\r\nhave been during these late troubles, in practice there, and which are\r\ncontrary or derogatory to the King's authority and government, shall be\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the rules and prescriptions of the said Royal Charter for\r\nadministering and taking the oath of allegiance, be henceforth duly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the administration of justice be in the King's name.\r\n\r\n\"4. That since the principle and formation of that Charter was and is\r\nthe freedom of liberty of conscience, we do hereby charge and require\r\nyou that freedom of liberty be duly admitted and allowed, so that they\r\nthat desire to use the Book of Common Prayer and perform their devotion\r\nin the manner that is established here, be not denied the exercise\r\nthereof, or undergo any prejudice or disadvantage thereby, they using\r\nthe liberty peaceably, without any disturbance to others.\r\n\r\n\"5. That all persons of good and honest lives and conversations be\r\nadmitted to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the said\r\nBook of Common Prayer, and their children to Baptism.\"[124]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more kind and assuring than the terms of the King's\r\nletter, notwithstanding the former hostility of the Massachusetts Bay\r\nrulers to him and his Royal father,[125] and nothing could be more\r\nreasonable than the five conditions on which he assured them of the\r\noblivion of the past and the continuance of the Royal Charter; but with\r\nnot one of these conditions did they take a step to comply for several\r\nmonths, under the pretext of affording time, after publishing it, that\r\n\"all persons might have opportunity to consider what was necessary to be\r\ndone,\" though the \"all persons\" referred to included only one-sixth of\r\nthe population: for the term \"Freeman of Massachusetts\" was at that\r\ntime, and for thirty years before and afterwards, synonymous with member\r\nof one of the Congregational Churches. And it was against their\r\ndisloyalty and intolerance that the five conditions of the King's pardon\r\nwere chiefly directed. With some of these conditions they never\r\ncomplied; with others only as they were compelled, and even complained\r\nof them afterwards as an invasion of their chartered privileges,[126]\r\nthough, in their first order for public thanksgiving for the King's\r\nletter, they spoke of it as assuring \"the continuance of peace,\r\nliberties and the gospel.\" Though the agent of Rhode Island met the\r\nagents of Massachusetts Bay Colony before the King, and challenged them\r\nto cite, in behalf of Massachusetts, one act of duty or loyalty to the\r\nkings of England, in support of their present professions as loyal\r\nsubjects; yet the King was not disposed to punish them for the past, but\r\ncontinue to them their privileges, as they desired and promised they\r\nwould act with loyalty and tolerance in the future.[127]\r\n\r\nThe King's promised oblivion of the past and recognition of the Charter\r\nwas hailed and assumed as _unconditional_, while the King's conditions\r\nwere ignored and remained a dead letter. The elective franchise and\r\neligibility for office were still, _as_ heretofore, the exclusive\r\nprerogative of Congregational Church members; the government of the\r\ncolony was still in the hands alone of Congregational ministers and\r\nmagistrates, and which they cleaved to as for life; their persecutions\r\nof those who did not worship as they did, continued without abatement;\r\nthey persisted in their theocratic independence, and pretended to do all\r\nthis under a Royal Charter which forbade their making laws or\r\nregulations contrary to the laws of England, acting also in the face of\r\nthe King's conditions of pardoning their past offences, and perpetuating\r\ntheir Charter privileges.\r\n\r\nThe King's letter was dated the 28th of June, 1662, and was presented by\r\nMr. Bradstreet and Mr. Norton to the Governor and General Court at\r\nBoston, 8th of October, 1662;[128] but it was not until a General Court\r\ncalled in August, 1664, that \"the said letter was communicated to the\r\nwhole assembly, according to his Majesty's command, and copies thereof\r\nspread abroad.\"[129] In the meantime they boasted of their Charter being\r\nrecognised by the King, according, of course, to their own\r\ninterpretation of it, while for _twenty-two months_ they withheld the\r\nKing's letter, against his orders, from being published; concealing from\r\nthe victims of their proscription and persecution the toleration which\r\nthe King had announced as the conditions of his perpetuating the\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that those proscribed and persecuted parties in\r\nMassachusetts Bay Colony should complain to the King's Government that\r\nthe local Government had denied them every privilege which his Majesty\r\nhad assured to them through their friends in England, and by alleged\r\norders to the Government of Massachusetts Bay, and therefore that the\r\nKing's Government should determine to appoint Commissioners to proceed\r\nto the New England colonies to investigate the complaints made, and to\r\nregulate the affairs of the colonies after the disorders of the then\r\nrecent civil war, during which the Massachusetts Bay Government had\r\nwholly identified itself with Cromwell, and acted in hostility to those\r\nother American colonies which would not renounce their allegiance to the\r\nThrone, and avow allegiance to the usurper.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the Government of Massachusetts Bay saw that their\r\nsilence could no longer be persisted in with safety, and that a Royal\r\nCommission was inevitable,[130] that they even published the King's\r\nletter, and then, as a means of further procrastination and delay, they\r\nappended their order that the conditions prescribed in the Royal letter,\r\nwhich \"had influence upon the Churches as well as the civil state,\r\nshould be suspended until the Court should take action thereon\"--thus\r\nsubordinating the orders of the King to the action of the Massachusetts\r\nBay Court.\r\n\r\nFrom the Restoration, reports were most industriously circulated in the\r\nBay Colony, designed to excite popular suspicion and hostility against\r\nthe Royal Government, such as that their constitution and Church\r\nprivileges were to be suppressed, and superseded by a Royal Governor and\r\nthe Episcopal hierarchy, etc.; and before the arrival of the Royal\r\nCommissioners the object of their appointment was misrepresented and\r\ntheir character assailed; it was pretended their commission was a bogus\r\none, prepared \"under an old hedge,\"[131] and all this preparatory to the\r\nintended resistance of the Commissioners by the Governor and Council of\r\nMassachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nThe five conditions of continuing the Charter, specified in the King's\r\nletter of the 28th of June, 1662, the publication of which was\r\nsuppressed by the Massachusetts Bay Court for nearly two years, and the\r\nintolerance and proscription which it was intended to redress being\r\nstill practised, were doubtless among the causes which led to the\r\nappointment of the Royal Commissioners; but that Commission had\r\nreference to other colonies as well as Massachusetts Bay, and to other\r\nsubjects than the intolerant proscriptions of that colony.[132]\r\n\r\nAll the New England colonies except that of Massachusetts Bay\r\nrespectfully and cordially received the Royal Commissioners, and gave\r\nentire satisfaction in the matters which the Commissioners were intended\r\nto investigate.[133] The Congregational rulers of Massachusetts Bay\r\nalone rejected the Royal Commissioners, denied their authority, and\r\nassailed their character. In the early history of Upper Canada, when one\r\nChurch claimed to be established above every other, and the local\r\nGovernment sustained its pretensions as if authorized by law, it is\r\nknown with what tenacity and denunciation the Canadian ecclesiastic-civil\r\ngovernment resisted all appeals, both to the Local Legislature and to\r\nEngland, for a liberal government of equal laws and equal rights for all\r\nclasses of the King's subjects in Canada. But the excluded majority of\r\nthe Canadians had little to complain of in comparison of the excluded\r\nmajority of his Majesty's subjects of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where\r\nthe only avenue to office, or even the elective franchise, was membership\r\nin the Congregational Church, and where no dissenter from that Church\r\ncould have his children baptized, or worship God according to his\r\nconscience, except under pain of imprisonment, fine, banishment, or\r\ndeath itself.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pilgrim Fathers\" crossed the Atlantic to Plymouth in 1620, and the\r\n\"Puritan Fathers\" to Massachusetts Bay in 1628, professedly for the same\r\npurpose, namely, liberty to worship God without the imposition of\r\nceremonies of which they disapproved. The \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" as true and\r\nconsistent friends of liberty, exercised full liberty of worship for\r\nthemselves, and left others to enjoy the same liberty of worship which\r\nthey enjoyed; but the \"Puritan Fathers\" exercised their liberty not only\r\nby abandoning the Church and worship which they professed when they left\r\nEngland, and setting up a Congregational worship, but by prohibiting\r\nevery other form of worship, and its adherents with imprisonment, fine,\r\nexile, and death. And under this pretext of liberty of worship for\r\nthemselves, they proscribed and persecuted all who differed from them in\r\nreligious worship for fifty years, until their power to do so was taken\r\nfrom them by the cancelling of the Charter whose provisions they had so\r\npersistently and so cruelly abused, in contradistinction to the tolerant\r\nand liberal conduct of their brethren and neighbours of the Plymouth,\r\nRhode Island, and Connecticut colonies. In note on page 148, I have\r\ngiven extracts of the Report of the Royal Commissioners relative to\r\nthese colonies and their conduct and treatment of the Commissioners;\r\nand in the lengthened extract of the report relative to Massachusetts\r\nBay Colony, it is seen how different was the spirit and government of\r\nthe rulers of that colony, both in respect to their fellow-colonists and\r\ntheir Sovereign, from that of the rulers of the other New England\r\ncolonies, which had, indeed, to seek royal protection against the\r\noppressions and aggressions of the more powerful domineering Government\r\nof Massachusetts Bay. The rulers of this colony alone rejected the Royal\r\nCommissioners. For nearly two years the King's letter of the 28th of\r\nJune, 1662 (given in note on page 140), pardoning their acts of\r\ndisloyalty and assuring them of the continuance of their Charter on\r\ncertain conditions, remained unpublished and unnoticed; but on the\r\nappointment of the Royal Commissioners, in 1664, they proceeded to\r\nacknowledge the kindness of the King's letter of 1662, and other Royal\r\nletters; then changing their tone, they protest against the Royal\r\nCommission. They sent a copy of their address to the King, to Lord\r\nChancellor Clarendon, who, in connection with the Earl of Manchester and\r\nLord Say, had befriended them. They also wrote to others of their\r\nfriends, and among others to the Hon. and celebrated Robert Boyle, than\r\nwhom no man had shown himself a warmer or more generous friend to their\r\ncolony. I will give, not in successive notes, but in the text, their\r\naddress to the King, the King's reply, Lord Clarendon's and the Hon.\r\nRobert Boyle's letters to them on the subject of their address to the\r\nKing, and their rejection and treatment of the Royal Commission. I will\r\nthen give the sentiments of what is called the \"Petition of the\r\nminority\" of their own community on the subject, and their own answers\r\nto the chief propositions of the Royal Commissioners. From all this it\r\nwill appear that the United Empire Loyalists were the true liberals, the\r\nadvocates of universal toleration and of truly liberal government; while\r\nthe rulers of Massachusetts Bay were the advocates of religious\r\nintolerance and persecution of a government by a single religious\r\ndenomination, and hostile to the supreme authority of England, as well\r\nas to their more tolerant and loyal fellow-colonists.\r\n\r\nI will first give their characteristic address, called \"Petition\" or\r\n\"Supplication,\" to the King. I do so without abridgment, long as it is,\r\nthat I may not be chargeable with unfairness. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\nCopy of the Address of the Massachusetts Colony to King Charles the\r\nSecond, in 1664:\r\n\r\n\"To the King's Most Excellent Majestie.--The humble Supplication of the\r\nGeneral Court of the Massachusetts Colony, in New England.\r\n\r\n\"DREAD SOVEREIGN,\r\n\r\n\"Iff your poor subjects, who have removed themselves into a remote\r\ncorner of the earth to enjoy peace with God and man, doe, in this day of\r\ntheir trouble, prostrate themselves at your Royal feet, and beg your\r\nfavour, we hope it will be graciously accepted by your Majestie, and\r\nthat as the high place you sustain on earth doth number you here among\r\nthe gods, for you well imitate the God of heaven, in being ready to\r\nmaintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor,[135] and\r\nto receive their cries and addresses to that end. And we humbly beseech\r\nyour Majestie with patience and clemency to heare and accept our plain\r\ndiscourse, tho' of somewhat greater length than would be comely in other\r\nor lesser cases. We are remote,[136] and can speake but seldom, and\r\ntherefore crave leave to speake the more at once. Wee shall not largely\r\nrepeat how that the first undertakers for this Plantation, having by\r\nconsiderable summs purchased the right thereof granted to the Council\r\nestablished at Plimouth by King James, your Royal grandfather, did after\r\nobtain a patent given and confirmed to themselves by your Royal father,\r\nKing Charles the First, wherein it is granted to them, and their heirs,\r\nassigns and associates for ever, not only the absolute use and propriety\r\nof the tract of land therein mentioned, but also full and absolute power\r\nof governing[137] all the people of this place, by men chosen from among\r\nthemselves, and according to such lawes as they shall from time to time\r\nsee meet to make and establish, being not repugnant to the laws of\r\nEngland (they paying only the fifth part of the ore of gold and silver\r\nthat shall here be found, for and in respect of all duties, demands,\r\nexactions, and service whatsoever), as in the said patent is more at\r\nlarge declared. Under the encouragement and security of which Royal\r\nCharter this people did, at their own charges,[138] transport\r\nthemselves, their wives and families, over the ocean, purchase the lands\r\nof the natives, and plant this colony, with great labour, hazards, cost\r\nand difficulties, for a long time wrestling with the wants of a\r\nwilderness and the burdens of a new plantation; having, also, now above\r\n30 years enjoyed the aforesaid power and priviledge of government within\r\nthemselves, as their undoubted right in the sight of God and man,[139]\r\nand having had, moreover, this further favour from God and from your\r\nMajestie, that wee have received several gracious letters from your\r\nRoyal selfe, full of expressions tending to confirme us in our\r\nenjoyments, viz., in your Majestie's letter bearing date the 15th day of\r\nFebruary, 1660, you are pleased to consider New England as one of the\r\nchiefest of your colonies and plantations abroad, having enjoyed and\r\ngrown up in a long and orderly establishment, adding this royal promise:\r\n'Wee shall not come behind any of our royal predecessors in a just\r\nencouragement and protection of all our loving subjects there.' In your\r\nMajestie's letter of the 28th of June, 1662, sent us by our messengers,\r\nbesides many other gracious expressions, there is this: 'Wee will\r\npreserve and do hereby confirme the patent and Charter heretofore\r\ngranted unto them by our Royal father of blessed memory, and they shall\r\nfreely enjoy all the privileges and liberties granted unto them in and\r\nby the same.'[140] As for such particulars, of a civil and religious\r\nnature, as are subjoined in the said letter, we have applyed ourselves\r\nto the utmost to satisfy your Majesty, so far as doth consist with\r\nconscience, of our duty toward God and the just liberties and privileges\r\nof our patent.[141] Wee are further bound, with humble thankfulness, to\r\nacknowledge your Majestie's gracious expressions in your last letter we\r\nhave received, dated April 23, 1664, as (besides other instances\r\nthereof) that your Majestie hath not the least intention or thought of\r\nviolating, or in the least degree infringing, the Charter heretofore\r\ngranted by your Royal father with great wisdom, and upon full\r\ndeliberation, etc.\r\n\r\n\"But what affliction of heart must it needs be unto us, that our sins\r\nhave provoked God to permit our adversaries to set themselves against us\r\nby their misinformations, complaints and solicitations (as some of them\r\nhave made it their worke for many years), and thereby to procure a\r\ncommission under the great seal, wherein four persons (one of them our\r\nknowne and professed enemy) are impowered to hear, receive, examine and\r\ndetermine all complaints and appeals, in all causes and matters as well\r\nmilitary as criminal and civil, and to proceed in all things, for\r\nsettling this country according to their good and sound discretion,\r\netc., whereby, instead of being governed by rulers of our owne choosing\r\n(which is the fundamental privilege of our patent), and by lawes of our\r\nowne, wee are like to be subjected to the arbitary power of strangers,\r\nproceeding not by any established law, but by their own discretion. And\r\nwhereas our patent gives a sufficient royal warrant and discharge to all\r\nofficers and persons for executing the lawes here made and published, as\r\nis therein directed, we shall now not be discharged, and at rest from\r\nfurther molestation, when wee have so executed and observed our lawes,\r\nbut be liable to complaints and appeales, and to the determinations of\r\nnew judges, whereby our government and administrations will be made void\r\nand of none effect. And though we have yet had but a little taste of the\r\nwords or actings of these gentlemen that are come over hither in this\r\ncapacity of Commissioners, yet we have had enough to confirm us in our\r\nfeares that their improvement of this power, in pursuance of their\r\ncommission (should the same proceed), will end in the subversion of our\r\nall. We should be glad to hope that your Majesty's instructions (which\r\nthey have not been pleased to impart to us) may put such limitations to\r\ntheir business here as will take off our fear; but according to the\r\npresent appearance of things, we thus speak.\r\n\r\n\"In this case (dread Sovereign), our refuge under God is your royal\r\nselfe, whom we humbly address ourselves unto, and are the rather\r\nemboldened therein because your Majesty's last gracious letter doth\r\nencourage us to suggest what, upon the experience we have had, and\r\nobservations we have made, we judge necessary or convenient for the good\r\nand benefit of this plantation, and because we are well persuaded that\r\nhad your Majestie a full and right information of the state of things\r\nhere,[142] you would find apparent reason to put a stop to these\r\nproceedings, which are certainly discervient to your Majesty's interest\r\nand to the prosperity and welfare of this place.\r\n\r\n\"If these things go on (according to the present appearance), your\r\nsubjects here will either be forced to seek new dwellings, or sink and\r\nfaint under burdens that will to them be intolerable. The rigour of all\r\nnew endeavours in the several callings and occupations (either for\r\nmerchandise abroad or for subduing this wilderness at home) will be\r\nenfeebled, as we perceive it already begins to be, the good of\r\nconverting the natives obstructed, the inhabitants driven to we know not\r\nwhat extremities, and this hopeful plantation in the issue ruined. But\r\nwhatever becomes of us, we are sure the adversary cannot countervail the\r\nKing's damages.\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed a grief to our hearts to see your Majesty put upon this\r\nextraordinary charge and cost about a business the product whereof can\r\nnever reimburse the one half of what will be expended upon it. Imposed\r\nrulers and officers will have occasion to expend more than can be raised\r\nhere, so as nothing will return to your Majesty's exchequer; but instead\r\nthereof, the wonted benefit of customs, exported and imported into\r\nEngland from hence, will be diminished by discouragement and diminution\r\nof men's endeavours in their several occupations; or if the aim should\r\nbe to gratify some particular by livings and revenues here that will\r\nalso fail, where nothing is to be had, the King himself will be loser,\r\nand so will the case be formed here; for such is the poverty and\r\nmeanness of the people (by reason of the length and coldness of the\r\nwinters, the difficulty of subduing a wilderness, defect of staple\r\ncommodity, the want of money, etc.), that if with hard labour men get a\r\nsubsistence for their families, 'tis as much as the generality are able\r\nto do, paying but very small rates towards the public charges; and yet\r\nif all the country hath ordinarily raised by the year for all the\r\ncharges of the whole government were put together and then doubled or\r\ntrebled, it would not be counted, for one of these gentlemen, a\r\nconsiderable accommodation.[143]\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that the estates men have in conjunction with hard labour\r\nand vigorous endeavours in their several places do bring in a\r\ncomfortable subsistence for such a mean people (we do not diminish our\r\nthankfulness to God, that he provides for us in a wilderness as he\r\ndoth), yet neither will the former stand or the latter be discouraged,\r\nnor will both ever answer the ends of those that seek great things.\r\n\r\n\"We perceive there have been great expectations of what is to be had\r\nhere raised by some men's informations. But those informations will\r\nprove fallacious, disappointing them that have relied upon them; and if\r\nthe taking of this course should drive the people out of the country\r\n(for to a coalition therein they will never come), it will be hard to\r\nfind another people that will stay long or stand under any considerable\r\nburden in it, seeing it is not a country where men can subsist without\r\nhard labour and great frugality.\r\n\r\n\"There have also been high representations of great divisions and\r\ndiscontents among us, and of a necessity of sending commissioners to\r\nrelieve the aggrieved, etc.; whereas it plainly appears that the body of\r\nthis colony are unanimously satisfied in the present government, and\r\nabhorrent from change, and that what is now offered will, instead of\r\nrelieving, raise up such grievances as are intolerable. We suppose there\r\nis no government under heaven wherein some discontented persons may not\r\nbe found; and if it be a sufficient accusation against a government that\r\nthere are some such, who will be innocent? Yet, through the favour of\r\nGod, there are but few amongst us that are malcontent, and fewer that\r\nhave cause to be so.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the all-knowing God knows our greatest ambition is to live a poor\r\nand quiet life, in a corner of the world, without offence to God or man.\r\nWe came not in this wilderness to seek great things for ourselves; and\r\nif any come after us to seek them here, they will be disappointed. We\r\nkeep ourselves within our line, and meddle not with matters abroad; a\r\njust dependence upon and subjection to your Majesty, according to our\r\nCharter, it is far from our hearts to disacknowledge. We so highly prize\r\nyour favourable aspect (though at so great a distance), as we would\r\ngladly do anything that is within our power to purchase the continuance\r\nof it. We are willing to testify our affection to your Majesty's\r\nservice, by answering the proposal of your honourable Commissioners, of\r\nwhich we doubt not but that they have already given your Majesty an\r\naccount. We are carefully studious of all due subjection to your\r\nMajesty, and that not only for wrath, but for conscience sake; and\r\nshould Divine Providence ever offer an opportunity wherein we might, in\r\nany righteous way, according to our poor and mean capacity, testify our\r\ndutiful affection to your Majesty, we hope we should most gladly embrace\r\nit. But it is a great unhappiness to be reduced to so hard a case, as to\r\nhave no other testimony of our subjection and loyalty offered us but\r\nthis, viz., to destroy our own being, which nature teacheth us to\r\npreserve; or to yield up our liberties, which are far dearer to us than\r\nour lives, and which, had we had any fears of being deprived of, we had\r\nnever wandered from our fathers' houses into these ends of the earth,\r\nnor laid our labours or estates therein; besides engaging in a most\r\nhazardous and difficult war, with the most warlike of the natives, to\r\nour great charge and the loss of some of the lives of our dear friends.\r\nNeither can the deepest invention of man find out a more certain way of\r\nconsistence than to obtain a Royal donation from so great a prince under\r\nhis great seal, which is the greatest security that may be had in human\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\"Royal Sir, it is in your power to say of your poor people in New\r\nEngland, they shall not die. If we have found favour in the sight of our\r\nKing, let our life be given us at our petition (or rather that which is\r\ndearer than life, that we have ventured our lives, and willingly passed\r\nthrough many deaths to obtain), and our all at our request. Let our\r\ngovernment live, our patent live, our magistrates live, our laws and\r\nliberties live, our religious enjoyments live; so shall we all yet have\r\nfurther cause to say from our hearts, let the King live for ever. And\r\nthe blessing of them that were ready to perish shall come upon your\r\nMajesty; having delivered the poor that cried, and such as had none to\r\nhelp them. It was an honour to one of your royal ancestors that he was\r\ncalled the poor man's king. It was Job's excellency that he sat as king\r\namong his people--that he was a father to the poor. They are a poor\r\npeople (destitute of outward favour, wealth and power) who now cry to\r\ntheir lord the King. May your Majesty please to regard their cause and\r\nmaintain their right. It will stand among the marks of lasting honour to\r\nafter generations. And we and ours shall have lasting cause to rejoice,\r\nthat we have been numbered among your Majesty's most humble servants and\r\nsuppliants.\r\n\r\n\"25th October, 1664.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Massachusetts Governor and Council had endorsed a copy of the\r\nforegoing petition to the Earl of Clarendon, then Lord Chancellor (who\r\nhad dictated, with the Puritan ministers of the King, his generous\r\nletter of the 28th of June, 1662), I will here insert Lord Clarendon's\r\nreply to them, in which he vindicates the appointment of the\r\nCommissioners, and exposes the unreasonableness of the statements and\r\nconduct of the Massachusetts Court. The letter is as follows:\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from the Earl of Clarendon to the Massachusetts Colony\r\nin 1664:--\r\n\r\n\"MR. GOVERNOR AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n\"I have received yours of the 7th of November, by the hands of Mr.\r\nAshurst, a very sober and discreet person, and did (by his communicating\r\nit to me) peruse the petition you had directed to his Majesty; and I do\r\nconfess to you, I am so much a friend to your colony that if the same\r\nhad been communicated to nobody but myself, I should have dissuaded the\r\npresenting the same to his Majesty, who I doubt will not think himself\r\nwell treated by it, or the singular care he hath expressed of his\r\nsubjects in those parts sufficiently acknowledged; but since I found by\r\nyour letter to my Lord Chamberlaine and Mr. Boyle, that you expect some\r\neffect from your petition, upon conference with them wee all agreed not\r\nto hinder the delivery of it, though I have read to them and Mr. Ashurst\r\nevery word of the instructions the Commissioners have; and they all\r\nconfessed that his Majesty could not expresse more grace and goodness\r\nfor that his plantation, nor put it more out of their power in any\r\ndegree to invade the liberties and privileges granted to you by your\r\nCharter; and therefore wee were all equally amazed to find that you\r\ndemand a revokation of the Commission and Commissioners, without laying\r\nthe least matter to their charge of crymes or exorbitances. What sense\r\nthe King hath of your addresse to him, you will, I presume, heare from\r\nhimself, or by his direction. I shall only tell you that as you had long\r\ncause to expect that the King would send Commissioners thither, so that\r\nit was absolutely necessary he should do so, to compose the differences\r\namongst yourselves of which he received complaint, and to do justice to\r\nyour neighbours, which they demand from his royall hands. I know not\r\nwhat you mean by saying, the Commissioners have power to exercise\r\ngovernment there altogether inconsistent with your Charter and\r\nprivileges, since I am sure their commission is to see and provide for\r\nthe due and full observation of the Charter, and that all the privileges\r\ngranted by that Charter may be equally enjoyed by all his Majesty's\r\nsubjects there. I know they are expressly inhibited from intermeddling\r\nwith or obstructing the administration of justice, according to the\r\nformes observed there; but if in truth, in any extraordinary case, the\r\nproceedings there have been irregular, and against the rules of justice,\r\nas some particular cases particularily recommended to them by his\r\nMajesty, seeme to be, it cannot be presumed that his Majesty hath or\r\nwill leave his subjects of New England without hope of redresse by any\r\nappeale to him, which his subjects of all his other kingdoms have free\r\nliberty to make. I can say no more to you but that it is in your owne\r\npower to be very happy, and to enjoy all that hath been granted to you;\r\nbut it will be absolutely necessary that you perform and pay all that\r\nreverence and obedience which is due from subjects to their king, and\r\nwhich his Majesty will exact from you, and doubts not but to find from\r\nthe best of that colony both in quality and in number. I have no more to\r\nadd but that I am,\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate servant,\r\n\r\n\"CLARENDON, C.\r\n\r\n\"Worcester House, 15 March, 1665.\"\r\n\r\nTo Lord Clarendon's letter I will add the letter of the Honourable\r\nRobert Boyle to Governor Endicot. The Hon. Robert Boyle was not only\r\ndistinguished as the first philosopher of his age, but as the founder of\r\nthe Royal Society and the President of the Society for the Propagation\r\nof the Gospel in New England--the Society which supported John Eliot,\r\nthe apostle to the Indians of New England--for the Massachusetts Bay\r\nGovernment neither established nor supported his mission to the Indians.\r\nNew England never had a warmer and more benevolent friend than the\r\ncelebrated Robert Boyle, who, in a letter dated March 17th, 1665, and\r\naddressed to the Governor Endicot and the Massachusetts Court, after\r\nacknowledging their resolution of thanks, through Mr. Winthrop, to him\r\nfor his exertions on their behalf, proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I dealt very sincerely with Mr. Winthrop in what I informed him\r\nconcerning the favourable inclinations I had found both in his Majesty\r\nand in my Lord Chancellor toward the united colonies of New England; and\r\nthough his lordship again repeats and confirms the assurances he had\r\nauthorized me to give to your friends in the city, yet I cannot but\r\nacquaint you with this, observing that in your last addresses to his\r\nMajesty, and letters to his lordship, there are some passages that were\r\nmuch more unexpected than welcome; insomuch that not only those who are\r\nunconcerned in your affairs, but the most considerable persons that\r\nfavour you in England, have expressed to me their being unsatisfied in\r\nsome of the particulars I am speaking of. And it seems generally\r\nunreasonable that when the King had so graciously remitted all that was\r\npast, and upon just and important inducements, sent Commissioners to\r\npromote the welfare of your colony, you should (in expressions not over\r\nmanly or respectfully worded) be importunate with him to do an action\r\nlikely to blemish his wisdom or justice, or both, as immediately to\r\nrecall public ministers from so remote a part of the world before they\r\nor any of them be so much as accused of any one crime or miscarriage.\r\n\r\n\"And since you are pleased I should concern myself in this business, I\r\nmust deal so ingenuously with you as to inform you, that hearing about\r\nyour affairs, I waited upon my Lord Chancellor (and finding him, though\r\nnot satisfied with your late proceedings, yet neither your enemy, nor\r\nindisposed to be your favourer as before). His lordship was pleased,\r\nwith a condescending and unexpected freedom, to read himself, not only\r\nto me, but to another good friend of yours that I brought along with me,\r\nthe whole instructions and all the other papers that were delivered to\r\nthe Commissioners, and by the particulars of those it appeared to us\r\nboth that they had been so solicitous, viz., in the things that related\r\nto your Charter, and especially to the liberty of your consciences, that\r\nI could not but wonder at it, and add to the number of those that cannot\r\nthink it becomes his Majesty to recall Commissioners sent so far with no\r\nother instructions than those, before they have time to do any part of\r\nthe good intended you by themselves, and before they are accused of\r\nhaving done any one harmful thing, even in your private letters either\r\nto me or (as far as I know) to any of your friends here, who will be\r\nmuch discouraged from appearing on your behalf; and much disabled to do\r\nit successfully so long as such proceedings as these that relate to the\r\nCommissioners supply others with objections which those that wish you\r\nwell are unable to answer.\r\n\r\n\"I should not have taken this liberty, which the honour of your letter\r\nought to have filled with little less than acknowledgment, if the\r\nfavourable construction you have made of my former endeavours to do you\r\ngood offices did not engage me to continue them, though in a way which\r\n(in my poor apprehension) tends very directly to serve you, whether I do\r\nor no to please you; and as I presume you will receive, both from his\r\nMajesty and my Lord Chancellor, express assurances that there is nothing\r\nintended in violation to your Charter, so if the Commissioners should\r\nbreak their instructions and endeavour to frustrate his Majesty's just\r\nand favourable intentions towards you, you may find that some of your\r\nfriends here were not backward to accuse the Commissioners upon general\r\nsurmises that may injure you, than they will be ready to represent your\r\ngrievances, in case they shall actually oppress you; which, that they\r\nmay never do, is not more the expectation of them that recommended them\r\nto you than it is the hearty wish of a person who, upon the account of\r\nyour faithfulness and care of so good a work as the conversion of the\r\nnatives among you, is in a peculiar manner concerned to shew himself,\r\nhonoured Sir, your most affectionate and most humble servant,[144]\r\n\r\n\"RO. BOYLE.\"\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the benevolent and learned Robert Boyle and their\r\nother friends in England, besides Lord Clarendon and the King, who\r\ndisapproved of their pretentious spirit and proceedings, there were\r\nnumbers of their own fellow-colonists who equally condemned the\r\nassumptions and conduct of Governor Endicot and his Council. It has been\r\nshown in a previous chapter that in connection with the complete\r\nsuppression of the freedom of the press, petitioners to the Governor and\r\nCourt were punished for any expressions in their petitions which\r\ncomplained of the acts or proceedings of the Court. It therefore\r\nrequired no small degree of independence and courage for any among them\r\nto avow their dissent from the acts of rulers so despotic and\r\nintolerant. Yet, at this juncture of the rejection of the Royal\r\nCommission, and the denial of the King's authority, there were found\r\nUnited Empire Loyalists and Liberals, even among the Congregational\r\n\"freemen\" of Massachusetts Bay, who raised the voice of remonstrance\r\nagainst this incipient separation movement. A petition was prepared and\r\nsigned by nearly two hundred of the inhabitants of Boston, Salem,\r\nNewbury, and Ipswich, and presented to the Court. The compiler of the\r\n\"Danforth Papers,\" in the Massachusetts Historical Collection, says:\r\n\"Next follows the petition in which the minority of our forefathers have\r\nexhibited so much good sense and sound policy.\" The following is an\r\nextract of the Boston petition, addressed \"To the Honourable General\r\nCourt now assembled in Boston:\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please the Hon. Court:\r\n\r\n\"Your humble petitioners, being informed that letters are lately sent\r\nfrom his Majesty to the Governor and Council, expressive of resentment\r\nof the proceedings of this colony with his Commissioners lately sent\r\nhither, and requiring also some principal persons therein, with command\r\nupon their allegiance to attend his Majesty's pleasure in order to a\r\nfinal determination of such differences and debates as have happened\r\nbetween his Majesty's Commissioners and the Governor here, and which\r\ndeclaration of his Majesty, your petitioners, looking at as a matter of\r\nthe greatest importance, justly calling for the most serious\r\nconsideration, that they might not be wanting, either to yourselves in\r\nwithholding any encouragement that their concurrence might afford in so\r\narduous a matter, nor to themselves and the country in being involved by\r\ntheir silence in the dangerous mistakes of (otherwise well united)\r\npersons inclining to disloyal principles, they desire they may have\r\nliberty without offence to propose some of their thoughts and fears\r\nabout the matter of your more serious deliberation.\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners humbly conceive that those who live in this age are no\r\nless than others concerned in that advice of the wise man, to keep the\r\nKing's commandment, because of the oath of God, and not to be tardy to\r\ngo out of his sight that doth whatever pleaseth him; wherefore they\r\ndesire that seeing his Majesty hath already taken no little displeasure\r\nagainst us, as if we disowned his Majesty's jurisdiction over us,\r\neffectual care be taken, lest by refusing to attend his Majesty's order\r\nfor clearing our pretences unto right and favour in that particular, we\r\nshould plunge ourselves into great disfavour and danger.\r\n\r\n\"The receiving of a Charter from his Majesty's royal predecessor for the\r\nplanting of this colony, with a confirmation of the same from his royal\r\nperson, by our late address, sufficiently declares this place to be\r\npart of his dominions and ourselves his subjects. In testimony of which,\r\nalso, the first Governor, Mr. Matthew Cradock (as we are informed),\r\nstands recorded _juratus de fide et obedientia_, before one of the\r\nMasters in Chancery; whence it is evident that if any proceedings of\r\nthis colony have given occasion to his Majesty to say that we believe he\r\nhath no jurisdiction over us, what effectual course had need be taken to\r\nfree ourselves from the incurring his Majesty's future displeasure by\r\ncontinuance in so dangerous an offence? And to give his Majesty all due\r\nsatisfaction in that point, such an assertion would be no less\r\ndestructive to our welfare than derogatory to his Majesty's honour. The\r\ndoubtful interpretations of the words of a patent which there can be no\r\nreason to hope should ever be construed to the divesting of the\r\nsovereign prince of his Royal power over his natural subjects and liege\r\npeople, is too frail a foundation to build such transcendent immunity\r\nand privilege upon.\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners earnestly desire that no part will so irresistibly\r\ncarry on any design of so dangerous a consequence as to necessitate\r\ntheir brethren equally engaged with them in the same undertaking to make\r\ntheir particular address to his Majesty, and declaring to the world, to\r\nclear themselves from the least imputation of so scandalous an evil as\r\nthe appearance of disaffection or disloyalty to the person and\r\ngovernment of their lawful prince and sovereign would be.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore your petitioners do here humbly entreat that if any occasion\r\nhath been given to his Majesty so to resent any former actings as in his\r\nlast letter is held forth, that nothing of that nature be further\r\nproceeded in, but contrariwise that application be made to his Majesty,\r\nimmediately to be sent for the end to clear the transactions of them\r\nthat govern this colony from any such construction, lest otherwise that\r\nwhich, if duly improved, might have been a cloud of the latter rain, be\r\nturned into that which, in the conclusion, may be found more terrible\r\nthan the roaring of a lion.\r\n\r\n\"Thus craving a favourable interpretation of what is here humbly\r\npresented, your petitioners shall ever be obliged to, etc.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThe following is the King's letter, referred to by Lord Clarendon,\r\nevidently written on the advice of the Puritan Councillors, whom the\r\nKing retained in his government, and to whom the management of New\r\nEngland affairs seems to have been chiefly committed, with the oversight\r\nof the Lord Chancellor Clarendon. This letter, in addition to a previous\r\nletter from the King of the same kind, together with the letters of Lord\r\nClarendon and the Hon. Robert Boyle, left them not a shadow of pretext\r\nfor the inflammatory statements they were putting forth, and the\r\ncomplaints they were making, that their Charter privileges and rights of\r\nconscience were invaded, and was a reply to the petition of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Governor and Council (inserted above at length, pages\r\n153-159), and shows the utter groundlessness of their statements; that\r\nwhat they contended for under the pretext of conscience was the right of\r\npersecuting and proscribing all who did not conform to the\r\nCongregational worship; and that what they claimed under the pretence of\r\nCharter rights was absolute independence, refusing to submit even to\r\ninquiry as to whether they had not encroached upon the rights and\r\nterritories of their white and Indian neighbours, or made laws and\r\nregulations and performed acts contrary to the laws of England and to\r\nthe rights of other of the King's subjects. This letter breathes the\r\nspirit of kindness and forbearance, and contends for _toleration_, as\r\ndid all the loyal colonists of the time, appealing to the King for\r\nprotection against the intolerance, persecution and proscription of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Congregational Government. The letter is as follows:\r\n\r\nCopy of a Letter from Secretary Morrice to the Massachusetts Colony:\r\n\r\n\"SIRS,\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty hath heard this petition[146] read to him, and hath well\r\nweighed all the expressions therein, and the temper and spirit of those\r\nwho framed it, and doth not impute the same to his colony of\r\nMassachusetts, amongst whom he knows the major part consists of men well\r\naffected to his service and obedient to his government, but he hath\r\ncommanded me to let you know that he is not pleased with this petition,\r\nand looks upon it as the contrivance of a few persons who have had too\r\nlong authority there, and who use all the artifices they can to infuse\r\njealousies into his good subjects there, and apprehensions as if their\r\nCharter were in danger, when it is not possible for his Majesty to do\r\nmore for the securing it, or to give his subjects there more assurance\r\nthat it shall not in any degree be infringed, than he hath already done,\r\neven by his late Commission and Commissioners sent thither, who are so\r\nfar from having the least authority to infringe any clause in the said\r\nCharter, that it is the principal end of their journey, so chargeable to\r\nhis Majesty, to see that the Charter be fully and punctually observed.\r\nHis Majesty did expect thanks and acknowledgments from that his colony,\r\nof his fatherly care in sending his Commissioners thither, and which he\r\ndoubts not he shall receive from the rest of the colonies in those\r\nparts, and not such unreasonable and groundless complaint as is\r\ncontained in your petition, as if he had thereby intended to take away\r\nyour privileges and to drive you from your habitations, without the\r\nleast mention of any misdemeanour or miscarriage in any one of the said\r\nCommissioners or in any one particular. Nor can his Majesty comprehend\r\n(except you believe that by granting your Charter he hath parted with\r\nhis sovereign power over his subjects there) how he could proceed more\r\ngraciously, or indeed any other way, upon so many complaints presented\r\nto him by particular persons of injustice done contrary to the\r\nconstitution of that government: from the other colonies, for the\r\noppression they pretend to undergo by the conduct of Massachusetts, by\r\nextending their bounds and their jurisdiction further than they ought to\r\ndo, as they pretend; from the natives, for the breach of faith and\r\nintolerable pressures laid upon them, as they allege, contrary to all\r\nkind of justice, and even to the dishonour of the English nation and\r\nChristian faith, if all they allege be true. I say, his Majesty cannot\r\ncomprehend how he could apply proper remedies to these evils, if they\r\nare real, or how he could satisfy himself whether they are real or no by\r\nany other way or means than by sending Commissioners thither to examine\r\nthe truth and grounds of all the allegations, and for the present to\r\ncompose the differences the best they can, until, upon a full and clear\r\nrepresentation thereof to his Majesty, who cannot but expect the same\r\nfrom them, his Majesty's own final judgement and determination may be\r\nhad. And it hath pleased God so far already to bless that service that\r\nit's no small benefit his Majesty and his English colonies in those\r\nparts have already received by the said Commissioners in the removal of\r\nso inconvenient neighbours as the Dutch have been for these late years,\r\nand which would have been a more spreading and growing mischief in a\r\nshort time if it had not been removed. To conclude, I am commanded by\r\nhis Majesty to assure you again of your full and peaceable enjoyment of\r\nall the privileges and liberties granted to you by his Charter, which he\r\nhath heretofore and doth now again offer to renew to you, if you shall\r\ndesire it; and that you may further promise yourselves all the\r\nprotection, countenance, and encouragement that the best subjects ever\r\nreceived from the most gracious Prince; in return whereof he doth only\r\nexpect that duty and cheerful obedience that is due to him, and that it\r\nmay not be in the power of any malicious person to make you miserable by\r\nentertaining any unnecessary and unreasonable jealousies that there is a\r\npurpose to make you so. And since his Majesty hath too much reason to\r\nsuspect that Mr. Endicot,[147] who hath during all the late revolutions\r\ncontinued the government there, is not a person well affected to his\r\nMajesty's person or his government, his Majesty will take it very well\r\nif at the next election any other person of good reputation be chosen in\r\nthe place, and that he may no longer exercise that charge. This is all I\r\nhave to signify unto you from his Majesty, and remain,\r\n\r\n\"Your very humble servant,\r\n\"WILL. MORRICE.\r\n\"Whitehall, February 25th, 1665.\"\r\n\r\nBut this courteous and explicit letter had no effect upon the Governor\r\nand Council of Massachusetts Bay in allaying opposition to the Royal\r\nCommissioners, whose authority they refused to acknowledge, nor did it\r\nprevent their persecution of their brethren whom they termed\r\n\"Sectaries\"--the \"Dissenting party.\" The Commissioners having executed\r\nthe part of their commission relative to the Dutch and Indians, and\r\nfinding their authority resisted by the Governor and Council of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, reported the result to the King's Government, which\r\ndetermined to order the attendance of representatives of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Government, to answer in England the complaints\r\nprepared against them, and for their conduct to the Commissioners. The\r\nletter which the King was advised to address to that pretentious and\r\npersecuting Government speaks in a more decisive but kindly tone, and is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from King Charles II. to the Massachusetts Colony,\r\nApril, 1666:\r\n\r\n\"CHARLES R.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty having received a full information from his Commissioners\r\nwho were sent by him into New England, of their reception and treatment\r\nin the several colonies and provinces of that plantation, in all which\r\nthey have received great satisfaction but only that of Massachusetts;\r\nand he having likewise been fully informed of the account sent hither by\r\nthe Counsell of the Massachusetts, under the hand of the present\r\nGovernor, of all the passages and proceedings which have been there\r\nbetween the said Commissioners and them from the time of their first\r\ncoming over; upon all which it is very evident to his Majesty,\r\nnotwithstanding many expressions of great affection and duty, that those\r\nwho govern the Colony of Massachusetts do believe that the commission\r\ngiven by his Majesty to those Commissioners, upon so many and weighty\r\nreasons, and after so long deliberation, is an apparent violation of\r\ntheir Charter, and tending to the dissolution of it, and that in truth\r\nthey do, upon the matter, believe that his Majesty hath no jurisdiction\r\nover them, but that all persons must acquiesce in their judgments and\r\ndeterminations, how unjust soever, and cannot appeal to his Majesty,\r\nwhich would be a matter of such a high consequence as every man\r\ndiscernes where it must end. His Majesty, therefore, upon due\r\nconsideration of the whole matter, thinks fit to recall his said\r\nCommissioners which he hath at this present done, to the end he may\r\nreceive from them a more particular account of the state and condition\r\nof those his plantations, and of the particular differences and debates\r\nthey have had with those of the Massachusetts, that so his Majesty may\r\npass his final judgment and determination thereupon. His Majesty's\r\nexpress command and charge is, that the Governor and Counsell of the\r\nMassachusetts do forthwith make choice of five or four persons to attend\r\nupon his Majesty, whereof Mr. Richard Bellingham and Major Hathorn are\r\nto be two, both which his Majesty commands upon their allegiance to\r\nattend, the other three or two to be such as the Counsell shall make\r\nchoice of; and if the said Mr. Bellingham be the present Governor,\r\nanother fit person is to be deputed to that office till his return, and\r\nhis Majesty will then, in person, hear all the allegations, suggestions,\r\nor pretences to right or favour that can be made on the behalf of the\r\nsaid colony, and will then make it appear how far he is from the least\r\nthought of invading or infringing, in the least degree, the Royal\r\nCharter granted to the said colony. And his Majesty expects the\r\nappearance of the said persons as soon as they can possibly repair\r\nhither after they have notice of this his Majesty's pleasure. And his\r\nfurther command is, that there be no alterations with reference to the\r\ngovernment of the Province of Maine till his Majesty hath heard what is\r\nalledged on all sides, but that the same continue as his Majesty's\r\nCommissioners have left the same, until his Majesty shall further\r\ndetermine. And his Majesty further expressly charges and commands the\r\nGovernor and Counsell there, that they immediately set all such persons\r\nat liberty who have been or are imprisoned only for petitioning or\r\napplying themselves to his Majesty's Commissioners. And for the better\r\nprevention of all differences and disputes upon the bounds and limits of\r\nthe several colonies, his Majesty's pleasure is, that all determinations\r\nmade by his Majesty's said Commissioners with reference to the said\r\nbounds and limits may still continue to be observed, till, upon a full\r\nrepresentation of all pretences, his Majesty shall make his own final\r\ndetermination; and particularly the present temporary bounds set by the\r\nCommissioners between the colonies of New Plymouth and Rhode Island,\r\nuntil his Majesty shall find cause to alter the same. And his Majesty\r\nexpects that full obedience be given to this signification of his\r\npleasure in all particulars.\r\n\r\n\"Given at the Court at Whitehall, the 10th day of April, 1666, in the\r\neighteenth year of his Majesty's reign.\r\n\r\n\"WILL. MORRICE.\"\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the proceedings of the Massachusetts Bay Court in\r\nreference to this letter of the King, it may be proper to pause a little\r\nand retrospect past transactions between the two Charleses and the\r\nCongregational rulers of Massachusetts Bay, and the correspondence of\r\nthe latter with the Royal Commissioners, so prominently referred to in\r\nthe above letter.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing documents which I have so largely quoted evince the Royal\r\nindulgence and kindness shown to the Massachusetts Bay Colony after the\r\nconduct of its rulers to the King and his father during the twenty years\r\nof the civil war and Commonwealth; the utter absence of all intention on\r\nthe part of Charles the Second, any more than on the part of Charles the\r\nFirst, to limit or interfere with the exercise of their own conscience\r\nor taste in their form or manner of worship, only insisting upon the\r\nenjoyment of the same liberty by those who preferred another form and\r\nmanner of worship. However intolerant and persecuting the Governments of\r\nboth Charles the First and Second were to all who did not conform to the\r\nestablished worship and its ceremonies in England, they both disclaimed\r\nenforcing them upon the New England colonies; and I repeat, that it may\r\nbe kept in mind, that when the first complaints were preferred to\r\nCharles the First and the Privy Council, in 1632, against Endicot and\r\nhis Council, for not only not conforming to, but abolishing, the worship\r\nof the Church of England, the accused and their friends successfully,\r\nthough falsely, denied having abolished the Episcopal worship; and the\r\nKing alleged to his Council, when Laud was present, that he had never\r\nintended to enforce the Church ceremonies objected to upon the New\r\nEngland colonists. The declarations of Charles the Second, in his\r\nletters to them, confirmed as they were by the letters of the Earl of\r\nClarendon and the Honourable Robert Boyle, show the fullest recognition\r\non the part of the Government of the Restoration to maintain their\r\nperfect liberty of worship. Their own address to the King in 1664 bears\r\ntestimony that for upwards of thirty years liberty of worship had been\r\nmaintained inviolate, and that King Charles the Second had himself\r\ninvariably shown them the utmost forbearance, kindness, and\r\nindulgence.[148]\r\n\r\nYet they no sooner felt their Charter secure, and that the King had\r\nexhausted the treasury of his favours to them, than they deny his right\r\nto see to their fulfilment of the conditions on which he had promised to\r\ncontinue the Charter. The Charter itself, be it remembered, provided\r\nthat they should not make any laws or regulations contrary to the laws\r\nof England, and that all the settlers under the Charter should enjoy all\r\nthe rights and privileges of British subjects. The King could not know\r\nwhether the provisions of the Royal Charter were observed or violated,\r\nor whether his own prescribed conditions of continuing the Charter were\r\nignored or fulfilled, without examination; and how could such an\r\nexamination be made except by a Committee of the Privy Council or\r\nspecial Commissioners? This was what the King did, and what the Governor\r\nand Court of Massachusetts Bay resisted. They accepted with a profusion\r\nof thanks and of professed loyalty the King's pardon and favours, but\r\ndenied his rights and authority. They denied any other allegiance or\r\nresponsibility to the King's Government than the payment of five per\r\ncent. of the proceeds of the gold and silver mines. The absurdity of\r\ntheir pretensions and of their resistance to the Royal Commission, and\r\nthe injustice and unreasonableness of their attacks and pretended\r\nsuspicions, are well exposed in the documents above quoted, and\r\nespecially in the petition of the \"minority\" of their own\r\nfellow-colonists. But all in vain; where they could not openly deny,\r\nthey evaded so as to render nugatory the requirements of the King as the\r\nconditions of continuing the Charter, as will appear from their\r\ncorrespondence with the Royal Commissioners. I will give two or three\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThey refused to take the oath of allegiance according to the form\r\ntransmitted to them by the King's order, or except with limitations that\r\nneutralized it. The first Governor of their Corporation, Matthew\r\nCradock, took the oath of allegiance as other officers of the Crown and\r\nBritish subjects, and as provided in the Royal Charter; but after the\r\nsecret conveyance of the Charter to Massachusetts Bay and the\r\nestablishment of a Government there, they, in secret deliberation,\r\ndecided that they were not British subjects in the ordinary sense; that\r\nthe only allegiance they owed to the King was such as the homage the\r\nHanse Towns paid to Austria, or Burgundy to the Kings of France; that\r\nthe only allegiance or obligation they owed to England was the payment\r\nof one-fifth per cent. of the produce of their gold and silver mines;\r\nthat there were no appeals from their acts or decisions to the King or\r\nCourts of England; and that the King had no right to see whether their\r\nlaws or acts were according to the provisions of the Charter. When the\r\nKing, after his restoration, required them to take the oath of\r\nallegiance as the first condition of continuing the Charter, they evaded\r\nit by attaching to the oath the Charter _according to their\r\ninterpretation of it_. Any American citizen could at this day take the\r\noath of allegiance to the Sovereign of England if it were limited to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. First of all, they required of every\r\nfreeman the oath of fidelity to the local Government; and then, after\r\nthree years' delay and debating about the oath of allegiance to the\r\nKing, the Massachusetts Bay Court adopted the following order:\r\n\r\n\"May 16th, 1665.\r\n\r\n\"It is ordered by this Court and by the authority thereof, that the\r\nfollowing oath be annexed unto the oaths of every freeman, and oath of\r\nfidelity, and to the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants, and to\r\nall other public officers as followeth. The oaths of freemen and of\r\nfidelity to run thus: 'Whereas, I, A.B., an inhabitant within this\r\njurisdiction, considering how I stand to the King's Majesty, his heirs\r\nand successors, _by our Charter_, and the Government established\r\nthereby, do swear _accordingly_, by the great and dreadful name of the\r\never living God, that I will bear faithful and true allegiance to our\r\nSovereign Lord the King, his heirs and successors; and so proceed _as in\r\nthe printed oaths of freemen and fidelity_.'\"[149]\r\n\r\nOn this, Col. Nichols, Chairman of the Royal Commission, addressing the\r\nCourt, remarks as follows:\r\n\r\n\"You profess you highly prize the King's favour, and that offending him\r\nshall never be imputed to you; and yet you, in the same paper, refuse to\r\ndo what the King requires should be done--that all that come into this\r\ncolony to dwell should take the oath of allegiance here. Your Charter\r\ncommands it; yet you make promises not therein expressed, and, in short,\r\nwould curtail the oath, as you do allegiance, refusing to obey the King.\r\nIt is your duty to administer justice in the King's name; and the King\r\nacknowledgeth in his letter, April 23, that it is his duty to see that\r\njustice be administered by you to all his subjects here, and yet you\r\nwill not give him leave to examine by his Commissioners.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to this subject again, Col. Nichols remarks:\r\n\r\n\"Touching the oath of allegiance, which is exactly prescribed in your\r\nCharter, and no faithful subject will make it less than according to the\r\nlaw of England. The oath mentioned by you was taken by Mr. Matthew\r\nCradock, as Governor, which hath a part of the oath of allegiance put\r\ninto it, and ought to be taken in that name by all in public office;\r\nalso in another part of the Charter it is expressly spoken of as the\r\noath of allegiance; and how any man can make that in fewer words than\r\nthe law of England enjoins, I know not how it can be acceptable to his\r\nMajesty.\"[150]\r\n\r\nAs a sect in the Jewish nation made void the law by their traditions, so\r\nthe sect of Congregational rulers in Massachusetts Bay thus made void\r\nthe national oath of allegiance by their additions. On the subject of\r\nliberty of worship according to the Church of England, these sectarian\r\nrulers express themselves thus:\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the use of the Common Prayer Book and ecclesiastical\r\nprivileges, our humble addresses to his Majesty have fully declared our\r\nends, in our being voluntary exiles from our dear native country, which\r\nwe had not chosen at so dear a rate, could we have seen the word of God\r\nwarranting us to perform our devotions in that way; and to have the same\r\nset up here, we conceive it is apparent, that it will disturb our peace\r\nin our present enjoyments; and we have commended to the ministry and\r\npeople here the word of the Lord for their rule therein, as you may find\r\nby your perusal of our law book, title 'Ecclesiastical,' p. 25.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the King's Commissioners reply as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The end of the first Planters coming hither was (as expressed in your\r\naddress, 1660), the enjoyment of the liberty of your own consciences,\r\nwhich the King is so far from taking away from you, that by every\r\noccasion he hath promised and assured the full enjoyment of it to you.\r\nWe therefore advise that you should not deny the liberty of conscience\r\nto any, especially where the King requires it; and that upon a vain\r\nconceit of your own that it will disturb your enjoyments, which the King\r\noften hath said it shall not.\r\n\r\n\"Though you commend to the ministers and people the word of the Lord for\r\ntheir rule, yet you did it with a proviso that they have the approbation\r\nof the Court, as appears in the same page; and we have great reason both\r\nto think and say that the King and his Council and the Church of England\r\nunderstand and follow the rules in God's word as much as this\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\n\"For the use of the Common Prayer Book: His Majesty doth not impose the\r\nuse of the Common Prayer Book on any, but he understands that liberty of\r\nconscience comprehends every man's conscience as well as any particular,\r\nand thinks that all his subjects should have equal rights; and in his\r\nletter of June 28, 1662, he requires and charges that all his subjects\r\nshould have equally an allowance thereof; but why you should put that\r\nrestraint on his Majesty's subjects that live under his obedience, his\r\nMajesty doth not understand that you have any such privileges.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning ecclesiastical privileges, we suppose you mean sacraments,\r\nbaptisms, etc. You say we have commended the word of the Lord for our\r\nrule therein, referring us to the perusal of the printed law, page 25.\r\nWe have perused that law, and find that that law doth cut off those\r\nprivileges which his Majesty will have, and see that the rest of his\r\nsubjects have.\"[151]\r\n\r\nI now resume the narrative of questions as affecting the authority of\r\nthe Crown and the subjection of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. That\r\ncolony was the most populous and wealthy of all the New England\r\ncolonies. Its principal founders were men of wealth and education; the\r\ntwelve years' tyranny of Charles the First and Laud, during the\r\nsuspension of Parliament, caused a flow of more than twenty thousand\r\nemigrants to Massachusetts Bay, with a wealth exceeding half a million\r\nsterling, and among them not less than seventy silenced clergymen.\r\nDuring the subsequent twenty years of the civil war and Commonwealth in\r\nEngland, the rulers of that colony actively sided with the latter, and\r\nby the favour and connivance of Cromwell evaded the Navigation Law\r\npassed by the Parliament, and enriched themselves greatly at the expense\r\nof the other British colonies in America, and in violation of the law of\r\nParliament. In the meantime, being the stronger party, and knowing that\r\nthey were the favourites of Cromwell, they assumed, on diverse grounds,\r\npossession of lands, south, east, north, and west, within the limits of\r\nthe neighbouring colonies, and made their might right, by force of arms,\r\nwhen resisted; and denied the citizenship of freemen to all except\r\nactual members of the Congregational Churches, and punished Dissenters\r\nwith fine, imprisonment, banishment, and death itself in many instances.\r\n\r\nOn the restoration of Charles the Second to the throne of his ancestors,\r\nit was natural that the various oppressed and injured parties, whether\r\nof colonies or individuals, should lay their grievances before their\r\nSovereign and appeal to his protection; and it was not less the duty of\r\nthe Sovereign to listen to their complaints, to inquire into them, and\r\nto redress them if well founded. This the King, under the guidance of\r\nhis Puritan Councillors, proceeded to do in the most conciliatory and\r\nleast offensive way. Though the rulers of Massachusetts Bay did not, as\r\ndid the other New England as well as Southern colonies, recognize and\r\nproclaim the King on the announcement of his restoration, but observed a\r\nsullen silence until they saw that the monarchy was firmly established;\r\nyet the King took no offence at this, but addressed them in terms the\r\nmost conciliatory, assuring them that he would overlook the past and\r\nsecure to them the privileges of their Charter, and the continued\r\nfreedom of their worship, upon the conditions of their taking the oath\r\nof allegiance, administer their laws as British subjects, and grant to\r\nall their fellow-colonists equal freedom of worship and of conscience\r\nwith themselves. They professed, as well they might, to receive the\r\nKing's declaration of oblivion for past offences and irregularities, and\r\npromise of perpetuating their original Charter, with feelings of\r\ninexpressible gratitude and delight; but they did not publish the King's\r\nletter for nearly two years, notwithstanding his command to do so; and\r\nwhen they did publish it, they appended an order that the conditions\r\nwere not to be acted upon until their further order.\r\n\r\nThe King's proclamation of pardon of the past, and promise of the\r\nfuture, produced no other effect than a profusion of wordy compliments\r\nand a vague intimation of doing as the King required, _as far as their\r\nCharter and conscience would permit_. Their policy of proscription and\r\nignoring the Royal authority in their laws and government remaining\r\nunchanged, and the complaints of oppressed colonies and individuals\r\nmultiplying, the adoption of further measures became necessary on the\r\npart of the Crown; and it was decided to appoint a Royal Commission,\r\nwhich should be at once a Court of Inquiry and a Court of Appeal, at\r\nleast in the first instance, reporting the results of their inquiries\r\nand their decisions in cases of appeal for the information and final\r\ndecision of the highest authority in England, to which any dissatisfied\r\nparty could appeal against the report or decision of the Commissioners.\r\nThe address or \"Petition\" to the King, dated 1664, and given above, pp.\r\n153-9, in all its tedious length and verbiage, shows how grossly they\r\nmisrepresented the character and objects of the Commission, preparatory\r\nto resisting and rejecting it, while the King's letter in reply, also\r\ngiven above at length, p. 166, completely refutes their misstatements,\r\nand duly rebukes their unjust and offensive insinuations.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the report of the Commissioners, together with the\r\nstatements and pretensions of the Massachusetts Bay Court, the King\r\nmight have employed ships and soldiers to enforce his just and\r\nreasonable commands, or have cancelled the Charter, as the conditions of\r\nits continuance had not been fulfilled, and have established\r\nMassachusetts Bay Plantation as a Royal colony; but he was advised to\r\nadopt the milder and more forbearing course of giving them opportunity\r\nof answering directly the complaints made against them, and of\r\njustifying their acts and laws. He therefore, in the Royal letter given\r\nabove, dated April 6, 1666, required them within six months to send five\r\nof their number to England to answer and to disprove if they could\r\ncomplaints made against them, and to furnish proof of the professions\r\nand statements they had made in their address and petition. They could\r\nno longer evade or delay; they were brought face to face with the\r\nauthority of King and Parliament; they could adduce nothing but their\r\nown assertions in their justification; facts were against their words;\r\nthey adopted their usual resource to evade all inquiry into their laws\r\nand acts by pleading the immunity of their Charter, and refused to send\r\nrepresentatives to England. They wished the King to take their own words\r\nalone as proofs of their loyalty to the Crown and equity to their\r\nfellow-colonists. In place of sending representatives to England to meet\r\ntheir accusers face to face and vindicate their acts, they sent two\r\nlarge masts, thirty-four yards long, which they said they desired to\r\naccompany with a thousand pounds sterling as a present to his Majesty,\r\nbut could get no one to lend them that sum, for the purpose of thus\r\nexpressing their good-will to the King, and of propitiating his favour.\r\nTheir language of adulation and profession was most abject, while they\r\nimplored the Royal clemency for refusing to obey the Royal commands.\r\nTheir records state that \"11, 7mo., 1666, the General Court assembled on\r\naccount of a signification from his Majesty requiring the Council of\r\nthis colony to send five able and meet persons to make answer for\r\nrefusing jurisdiction to his Commissioners last year; whereof Mr.\r\nRichard Bellingham and Mr. Hawthorne to be two of them, whom he\r\nrequires, on their allegiance, to come by first opportunity. The Court\r\nmet and agreed to spend the forenoon of the next day in prayer.\r\n\r\n\"12, 7mo., 1666. The Court met and sundry elders, and spent the forenoon\r\nin prayer.\r\n\r\n\"13, 7mo., 1666. The Court met and the elders were present after lecture\r\nand some debate had in Court concerning the duty we owe to his Majesty\r\nin reference to his signification.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 14th sundry petitions were presented from the \"minority\" in\r\nBoston, Salem, Ipswich, and Newbury, in favour of compliance with the\r\nKing's requirement; and the subject was debated in Council some days,\r\nwhen, on the 17th, the Court adopted an answer to the \"King's\r\nsignification,\" containing the following words addressed to the King's\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Morrice:\r\n\r\n\"We have, in all humility, given our reasons why we _could_ not submit\r\nto the Commissioners and their mandates the last year, which we\r\nunderstand lie before his Majesty. To the substance thereof we have\r\nnothing to add; and therefore can't expect that the ablest persons among\r\nus could be in a capacity to declare our case more fully.\r\n\r\n\"We must therefore commit this our great concernment unto Almighty God,\r\npraying and hoping that his Majesty (a prince of so great clemency) will\r\nconsider the estate and condition of his poor and afflicted subjects at\r\nsuch a time, being in imminent danger, by the public enemies of our\r\nnation, by sea and land, and that in a wilderness far remote from\r\nrelief; wherefore we do in this wise prostrate ourselves before his\r\nMajesty, and beseech him to be graciously pleased to rest assured of our\r\nloyalty and allegiance _according to our former professions_. Thus with\r\nour humble service to your Honour, and earnest prayers to God for his\r\nMajesty's temporal and eternal happiness, we remain your Honour's humble\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\"17, 7mo., 1666.\"[152]\r\n\r\nBut even in their Council, where the \"elders\" or ministers and their\r\nnominees were supreme, both to rule and to persecute, and to maintain\r\nwhich they were plotting and struggling with the intensity of the Papacy\r\nof late years against the Government of Italy, there were yet among\r\ntheir number men of distinction, who contended for the rights of the\r\nCrown, to decide questions of appeal from the colony, and to appoint a\r\nspecial commission for that purpose, such as Mr. Simon Bradstreet, who\r\nhad been Governor, and as their Commissioner to England, with Mr.\r\nNorton, had obtained the famous letter of Charles the Second, dated 10th\r\nof June, 1662, which filled the Court of Massachusetts Bay with\r\ninexpressible joy; and Mr. Dudley, son of a former Governor, and himself\r\nfirst Governor appointed by the Crown after the cancelling of the\r\nCharter; and Major Dennison, a man of mark, also in their Council.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Danforth's notes of the debate on the answer to the King's\r\nsignification, _Mr. Bradstreet_ is reported to have said: \"I grant legal\r\nprocess in a course of law reaches us not in an ordinary course; yet I\r\nthink the King's prerogative gives him power to command our appearance,\r\nwhich, before God and men, we are to obey.\" _Mr. Dudley_: \"The King's\r\ncommands pass anywhere--Ireland, Calais, etc.--although ordinary process\r\nfrom judges and officers pass not. No doubt you may have a trial at law\r\nwhen you come to England, if you desire it, and you may insist upon and\r\nclaim it. Prerogative is as necessary as law, and it is for the good of\r\nthe whole that there be always power in being able to act; and where\r\nthere is a right of power, it will be abused so long as it is in the\r\nhands of weak men, and the less pious the more apt to miscarry; but\r\nright may not be denied because it may be abused.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Court had adopted its answer of refusal to the King's\r\nsignification, Mr. Bradstreet said: \"I fear we take not a right course\r\nfor our safety. It is clear that this signification is from his Majesty.\r\nI do desire to have it remembered that I do dissent, and desire to have\r\nit recorded that I dissent, from that part of it as is an answer to the\r\nKing's signification.\" Major Dennison declared his dissent from the\r\nletter to Mr. Morrice, as not being proportionate to the end desired,\r\nand he hoped, intended, and desired it might be entered--namely, due\r\nsatisfaction to his Majesty, and the preservation of the peace and\r\nliberty of the colony.[153]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing facts that the alleged invasion of\r\nchartered rights and privileges put forth by the ruling party of\r\nMassachusetts Bay was a mere pretext to cover the long-cherished\r\npretensions (called by them \"dear-bought rights\") to absolute\r\nindependence; that is, the domination of the Congregationalist\r\nGovernment, to the exclusion of the Crown, to proscribe from the\r\nelective franchise and eligibility to office all but Congregationalists,\r\nand to persecute all who differed from them in either religious or\r\npolitical opinion, including their control and suppression of the\r\nfreedom of the press.[154] They persisted in the cruel persecution of\r\ntheir Baptist brethren as well as of the Quakers, notwithstanding the\r\nKing had established the fullest religious liberty by Royal Charter,\r\ngranted in 1663 to the Colonies of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and had\r\nby his letters in 1662 and 1664, and subsequently, forbidden religious\r\npersecution and prescribed religious toleration as a condition of the\r\ncontinuance of the Charter in Massachusetts Bay Colony.[155]\r\n\r\nI will give in a note, from the records of their own Court, their\r\npersecuting proceedings against certain Baptists in April, 1666, six\r\nyears after the Restoration.[156]\r\n\r\nThe Puritan historian, Neal, writing under date three years later,\r\n1669, says: \"The displeasure of the Government ran very high against the\r\nAnabaptists and Quakers at this time. The Anabaptists had gathered one\r\nChurch at Swanzey, and another at Boston, but the General Court was very\r\nsevere in putting the laws in execution against them, whereby many\r\nhonest people were ruined by fines, imprisonment, and banishment, which\r\nwas the more extraordinary because their brethren in England were\r\ngroaning under persecution from the Church of England at the same time.\r\nSad complaints were sent over to England every summer of the severity of\r\nthe Government against the Anabaptists, which obliged the dissenting\r\nministers in London to appear at length in their favour. A letter was\r\naccordingly sent over to the Governor of Massachusetts, signed by Dr.\r\nGoodwin, Dr. Owen, Mr. Nie, Mr. Caryl, and nine other ministers,\r\nbeseeching him to make use of his authority and interest for restoring\r\nsuch to their liberty as were in prison on account of religion, and that\r\ntheir sanguinary laws might not be put in execution in future.\" [Mr.\r\nNeal gives the letter, and then proceeds.] \"But the excellent letter\r\nmade no impression upon them; the prisoners were not released, nor the\r\nexecution of the laws suspended; nay, so far from this, that ten years\r\nafter, in the year 1679, a General Synod being called to inquire into\r\nthe evils that provoked the Lord to bring his judgments on New England,\r\nthey mention these among the rest, 'Men have set up their thresholds by\r\nGod's threshold, and their posts by God's post; Quakers are false\r\nworshippers, and such Anabaptists as have risen up among us, in\r\nopposition to the Churches of the Lord Jesus,' etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore it must needs be provoking to God if these things be not duly\r\nand fully testified against by every one in their several capacities\r\nrespectively.\"[158]\r\n\r\nThe present of two large masts and a ship-load of timber; successive\r\nobsequious and evasive addresses; explanations of agents; compliance in\r\nsome particulars with the Royal requirements in regard to the oath of\r\nallegiance, and administering the law, so far appeased the King's\r\nGovernment that further action was suspended for a time in regard to\r\nenforcing the granting of the elective franchise, eligibility to office,\r\nand liberty of worship to other than Congregationalists,[159] especially\r\nas the attention of Charles was absorbed by exciting questions at home,\r\nby his war with Holland, which he bitterly hated, and his intrigues with\r\nFrance, on which he became a paid dependant. But the complaints and\r\nappeals to the King from neighbouring colonies of the invasion of\r\nindividual and territorial rights by the Court of Massachusetts Bay, and\r\nfrom the persecuted and proscribed inhabitants of their own colony,\r\nawakened at last the renewed attention of the King's Government to the\r\nproceedings of the Massachusetts Bay rulers. The letter which the King\r\nwas advised to address to them is kind and conciliatory in its tone; but\r\nit shows that while the King, as he had declared in his first letter,\r\naddressed to them seventeen years before, recognized the \"Congregational\r\nway of worship,\" he insisted on toleration of the worship of\r\nEpiscopalians, Baptists, etc., and the civil rights and privileges of\r\ntheir members,[161] denied by these \"fathers of American liberty\" to\r\nthe very last; until then, power of proscription and persecution was\r\nwrested from them by the cancelling of their Charter.\r\n\r\nThe chief requirements of this letter were, as stated by Mr. Hutchinson:\r\n\r\n\"1. That agents be sent over in six months, fully instructed to answer\r\nand transact what was undetermined at that time.\r\n\r\n\"2. That freedom and liberty of conscience be given to such persons as\r\ndesire to serve God in the way of the Church of England, so as not to\r\nbe thereby made obnoxious, or discountenanced from their sharing in the\r\ngovernment, much less that they, or any other of his Majesty's subjects\r\n(not being Papists) who do not agree in the Congregational way, be by\r\nlaw subject to fines or forfeitures or other incapacities.\r\n\r\n\"3. That no other distinction be observed in making freemen than that\r\nthey be men of competent estates, rateable at ten shillings, according\r\nto the rules of the place, and that such in their turns be capable of\r\nthe magistracy, and all laws made void that obstruct the same.\r\n\r\n\"4. That the ancient number of eighteen assistants be observed, as by\r\nCharter. (They had been limited to eight or ten.)\r\n\r\n\"5. That all persons coming to any privilege, trust or office, take the\r\noath of allegiance.\r\n\r\n\"6. That all military commissions as well as proceedings of justice run\r\nin his Majesty's name.\r\n\r\n\"7. That all laws repugnant to, and inconsistent with, the laws of\r\nEngland for trade, be abolished.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThere were certain injunctions in regard to complaints from neighbouring\r\ncolonies; but the necessity for such injunctions as those above\r\nenumerated, and stated more at large in the King's letter, as stated in\r\nnote on p. 187, given for the third or fourth time the nineteenth year\r\nafter the Restoration, shows the disloyal proscriptions and persecuting\r\ncharacter of the Government of Massachusetts Bay, and the great\r\nforbearance of the King's Government in continuing the Charter while the\r\nconditions of its proposed continuance were constantly violated.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey speaks of these requirements, and the whole policy of the\r\nKing's Government, as \"usurpations\" on the chartered rights of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Colony. But let any reader say in which of the above\r\nseven requirements there is the slightest \"usurpation\" on any right of a\r\nBritish subject; whether there is anything that any loyal British\r\nsubject would not freely acknowledge and respond to; requirements\r\nunhesitatingly obeyed by all the colonies except that of Massachusetts\r\nBay alone, and which have been observed by every British Province of\r\nAmerica for the last hundred years, and are observed by the Dominion of\r\nCanada at this day.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey, referring to this period (1676-82), says: \"Lord Clarendon's\r\nscheme of colonial policy was now ripe,\" but he does not adduce a word\r\nfrom Lord Clarendon to show what that policy was only by insinuations\r\nand assertions, and assumes it to have been the subversion of the rights\r\nand liberties of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Lord Clarendon, in his\r\nletter to the Governor Endicot, given above, pp. 160, 161, explains his\r\ncolonial policy, which was not only to maintain the Charter in its\r\nintegrity, but to see that its provisions and objects were not violated\r\nbut fulfilled, and that while the Congregational worship should not be\r\ninterfered with, the Congregational Government should not proscribe from\r\nthe elective franchise and liberty of worship the members of other\r\nProtestant denominations. The Hon. Robert Boyle, the philosopher and\r\nbenefactor of New England, and President of the New England Society for\r\nPropagation of the Gospel among the Indians, expressed the same views\r\nwith Lord Clarendon, and there is not a shadow of proof that Lord\r\nClarendon ever entertained any other policy in regard to New England\r\nthan that which he expressed in his letter to Governor Endicot in 1664.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey and other New England historians occupy four-fifths of their\r\npages with accounts of the continental proceedings of the Governments of\r\nthe Stuarts, and their oppressions and persecutions of Nonconformists in\r\nEngland, and then _assume_ that their policy was the same in regard to\r\nthe New England Colonies, and that the Massachusetts Bay Colony was\r\ntherefore the champion defender of colonial liberties, in denying\r\nresponsibility to the Imperial Government for its acts, and refusing the\r\nusual oaths, and acts of allegiance to the Throne; whereas their\r\n_assumptions_ (for they are nothing else) are unsupported by a single\r\nfact, and are contradicted, without exception, by the declarations and\r\nacts of the Government of Charles the Second, as well as by those of his\r\nroyal father. Language can hardly exaggerate or reprobate in too strong\r\nterms the cruel persecutions of dissenters from the Established\r\nEpiscopal Church in England, by both Charles the First and Charles the\r\nSecond; but the Congregational Government of Massachusetts Bay exceeded\r\nthat of the Charleses in proscribing and persecuting dissenters from\r\ntheir Established Congregational Churches in that colony; and as well\r\nmight Messrs. Palfrey, Bancroft, and other New England historians\r\nmaintain that, because Congregationalists contended for liberty of\r\nworship for themselves in England, they practised it in regard to those\r\nwho did not agree with them in worship in Massachusetts Bay. The\r\nproscription and persecution of Congregationalists and Baptists by\r\nEpiscopalian rulers in England were outrivalled by the Congregational\r\nrulers in their proscriptions and persecutions of Episcopalians and\r\nBaptists in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt is also assumed by the New England historians referred to that the\r\nKing's advisers had intimated the intention of appointing a\r\nGovernor-General over the Colonies of New England to see to the\r\nobservance of their Charters and of the Navigation Laws; but wherein did\r\nthis infringe the rights or privileges of any Colonial Charter? Wherein\r\ndid it involve any more than rightful attention to Imperial authority\r\nand interests? Wherein has the appointment or office of a\r\nGovernor-General of British North America, in addition to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of each province, ever been regarded to this day as\r\nan infringement of the rights and privileges of any Legislature or\r\nBritish subject in the colonies? Wherein has the right of appeal by any\r\ncolony or party to the Supreme Courts or authorities of England, against\r\nthe decisions of local Courts or local executive acts, been regarded as\r\nan infringement of colonial rights, or other than a protection to\r\ncolonial subjects? When has the right of appeal by parties in any of the\r\nneighbouring States, to the Supreme Court at Washington, been held to be\r\nan invasion of the rights of such States?\r\n\r\nThe rulers of Massachusetts Bay Colony concealed and secreted their\r\nCharter; they then represented it as containing provisions which no\r\nRoyal Charter in the world ever contained; they represented the King as\r\nhaving abdicated, and excluded himself from all authority over them as a\r\ncolony or as individuals; they denied that Parliament itself had any\r\nauthority to legislate for any country on the western side of the\r\nAtlantic; they virtually claimed absolute independence, erasing the oath\r\nof allegiance from their records, proscribing and persecuting all\r\nnonconformists to the Congregational worship, invading the territories\r\nof other colonies and then maintaining their invasions by military\r\nforce, denying the authority of Great Britain or of any power on earth\r\nto restrict or interfere with their acts. The New England historians\r\nreferred to are compelled to confess that the Royal Charter contained no\r\nsuch provisions or powers as the rulers of Massachusetts Bay pretended;\r\nyet their narratives and argumentations and imputations upon the British\r\nGovernment assume the truth of the fabulous representations of the\r\nCharter, and treat not only every act of the King as royal tyranny, but\r\nevery suspicion of what the King might do as a reality, and the\r\nhostility of the Massachusetts Bay Government as a defence of\r\nconstitutional rights and resistance of royal despotism. But in these\r\nlaboured and eloquent philippics against the Government of the\r\nRestoration, they seem to forget that the Parliament and Government of\r\nthe Commonwealth and Cromwell asserted far larger powers over the\r\ncolonies than did the Government and Parliament of Charles the Second\r\n(as is seen by their Act and appointments in their enactments quoted\r\nabove, pp. 88-90).\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth appointed a Governor-General (the Earl of Warwick),\r\nCommissioners with powers to remove and appoint Colonial Governors and\r\nother local officers; whereas the Commissioners appointed by Charles the\r\nSecond had no authority to remove or appoint a single local Governor or\r\nother officer, to annul or enact a single law, but to inquire and\r\nreport; and even as a Court of Appeal their proceedings and decisions\r\nwere to be reported for final action in England.\r\n\r\nThe famous Act of Navigation itself, which ultimately became the chief\r\nground of the American revolutionary war, was passed by the\r\nCommonwealth, though, by a collusion between Cromwell and the rulers of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, its provisions were evaded in that colony, while\r\nrigorously enforced in the other colonies.[165]\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Charles the Second this Act was renewed, with some\r\nadditional provisions.[166]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the correspondence between the King's Government and\r\nthe rulers of Massachusetts Bay. It may be supposed that after the King\r\nhad promised, in 1662, to forget past offences and continue the justly\r\nforfeited Royal Charter upon certain conditions, and that those\r\nconditions were evaded by various devices during nearly twenty years,\r\nthe Royal patience would become exhausted, and that, instead of the\r\ngentle instructions and remonstrances which had characterized his former\r\nletters, the King would adopt more severe and imperative language. Hence\r\nin his next letter, September 30, 1680, to the Governor and Council of\r\nthe Massachusetts, he commences in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"CHARLES R.\r\n\r\n\"Trusty and well beloved, we greet you well. When by our Royal letter,\r\nbearing date the 24th day of July, in the one and thirtieth year of our\r\nreign, we signified unto you our gracious inclination to have all past\r\ndeeds forgotten, setting before you the means whereby you might deserve\r\nour pardon, and commanding your ready obedience to several particulars\r\ntherein contained, requiring withall a speedy compliance with the\r\nintimations of your duty given to your late agents during their\r\nattendance here, all which we esteem essential to your quiet settlement\r\nand natural obedience due unto us. We then little thought that those\r\nmarks of our grace and favour should have found no better acceptance\r\namong you, but that, before all things, you should have given preference\r\nto the execution of our commands, when after so many months we come to\r\nunderstand by a letter from you to one of our principal Secretaries of\r\nState, dated the 21st of May last, that very few of our directions have\r\nbeen pursued by your General Court, the further consideration of the\r\nremaining particulars having been put off upon insufficient pretences,\r\nand even wholly neglecting your appointment of other agents which were\r\nrequired to be sent over unto us within six months after the receipt of\r\nour said letters, with full instructions to attend our Royal pleasure\r\nherein in relation to that our Government.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other matters, the King \"strictly commanded and required\" them,\r\n\"as they tendered their allegiance,\" to despatch such agents within\r\nthree months after their reception of the order, and with full powers to\r\nsatisfy his Majesty on the subjects of complaint; and \"he ended the\r\nletter,\" says Mr. Palfrey, \"with a very definite injunction:\"\r\n\r\n\"That the due observance of all our commands above mentioned may not be\r\nany longer protracted, we require you, upon receipt thereof, forthwith\r\nto call a General Court, and therein to read these our letters and\r\nprovide for our speedy satisfaction, and in default thereof we shall\r\ntake the most effectual means to procure the same. And so we bid you\r\nfarewell.\"[167]\r\n\r\nThis letter led to the calling of a \"Special General Court,\" January,\r\n1681, in which very protracted debates ensued on the revision of the\r\nlaws, so long delayed, and the election of agents to England according\r\nto the King's command. Samuel Nowell and John Richards were elected\r\nagents to England, but were restricted by instructions which forbade\r\nconceding anything from their original Charter pretensions, and\r\ntherefore rendered their agency an insult to the Government and the\r\nKing, and hastened the catastrophe which they so much dreaded, the\r\ncancelling of their Charter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to appease the displeasure of the Crown, they passed\r\nseveral Acts which had the appearance of obedience to the Royal\r\ncommands, but which they were careful not to carry into effect.[168] I\r\nwill give two or three examples.\r\n\r\nThey enacted \"that the Acts of Trade and Navigation should be forthwith\r\nproclaimed in the market-place of Boston by beat of drum, and that all\r\nclauses in said Acts relating to this Plantation should be strictly\r\ntaken notice of and observed.\" This appears very plausible, and is so\r\nquoted by Dr. Palfrey; but he does not add that care was taken that it\r\nshould not be carried into effect. And to accomplish their purposes, and\r\nto assert the subordination of the Royal authority to their own local\r\nauthority, \"they constituted naval _officers_, one for Boston, the other\r\nfor 'Salem and adjacent parts,' to be commissioned by the Governor, and\r\nto exercise powers of a nature to control the Collector appointed in\r\nEngland.\"[169]\r\n\r\nAfter nearly twenty years' delay and evasions, they enacted, in 1679,\r\n\"that the Governor, Deputy Governor, and Magistrates should take the\r\noath of allegiance 'without any reservation,' in the words sent them by\r\nhis Majesty's orders; but instead of the 'reservation' in their form of\r\noath in former Acts, they virtually neutralized the oath by an Act\r\nrequiring a prior preliminary oath of fidelity to the local\r\nGovernment,[170] an Act which the Board of Colonial Plantations viewed\r\nas 'derogatory to his Majesty's honour, as well as defective in point of\r\ntheir own duty.'\"\r\n\r\nThey instructed their agents in England to represent that there was no\r\ncolonial law \"prohibiting any such as were of the persuasion of the\r\nChurch of England.\" The design of this statement plainly was to impress\r\nupon the mind of the King's Government that there was no obstruction to\r\nthe worship and ordinances of the Church of England, and that the\r\nelective franchise and privilege of worship were as open to\r\nEpiscopalians as to Congregationalists--the reverse of fact. After\r\nrepeated letters from the King in favour of toleration as one of the\r\nconditions of continuing their Charter, notwithstanding their past\r\nviolation of it, they _professed_ to comply with the royal injunctions,\r\nbut their professed compliance amounted practically to nothing, as they\r\nhad evidently intended. The King's Commissioners had said to the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Court on this subject: \"For the use of the Common\r\nPrayer Book: His Majesty doth not impose the use of the Common Prayer\r\nBook on any; but he understands that liberty of conscience comprehends\r\nevery man's conscience, as well as any particular, and thinks that all\r\nhis subjects should have equal right.\" To this the Massachusetts Court\r\nreplied: \"Concerning the use of the Common Prayer Book and\r\necclesiastical privileges, our humble addresses to his Majesty have\r\nfully declared our main ends, in our being voluntary exiles from our\r\ndear native country, which we had not chosen at so dear a rate, could we\r\nhave seen the word of God warranting us to perform our devotions in that\r\nway; and to have the same set up here, we conceive it is apparent that\r\nit will disturb our peace in our present enjoyment.\"[171]\r\n\r\nBut afterwards they found it dangerous longer to resist the King's\r\ncommands, and professed to obey them by providing that those who were\r\nnot Congregationalists might exercise the elective franchise, provided\r\nthat, in addition to taking the oath of fidelity to the local\r\nGovernment, and paying a rate which was not paid by one in a hundred,\r\n_and obtaining a certificate from the Congregational minister as to\r\ntheir being blameless in words and orthodox in religion, they were then\r\napproved by the Court_. The right of franchise was possessed by every\r\nmember of any Congregational Church, whether he had property or not, or\r\npaid rate or not;[172] not so with any other inhabitant, unless he\r\nadduced proof that he had paid rate, produced a certificate of character\r\nand of orthodoxy in religion, signed by a Congregational minister, and\r\nwas approved by the Court. No instance is recorded of any Episcopalian\r\never having obtained the freedom of the colony under such conditions;\r\n\"nor,\" as Mr. Hutchinson says, \"was there any Episcopal Church in any\r\npart of the colony until the Charter was vacated.\"[174]\r\n\r\nThe Court of Massachusetts Bay also instructed their agents in England,\r\nin 1682, to represent that \"as for Anabaptists, they were now subject to\r\nno other penal statutes than those of the Congregational way.\" But as\r\nlate as the spring of 1680 the General Court forbade the Baptists to\r\nassemble for their worship in a meeting-house which they had built in\r\nBoston.[175] The statement which they instructed their agents to make in\r\nEngland was clearly intended to convey the impression that the Baptist\r\nworship was equally allowed with the Congregational worship; but though\r\npenalties against individual Baptists may have been relaxed, their\r\nworship was no more tolerated than that of the Episcopalian until the\r\ncancelling of the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of misleading evasion was practised upon the Government in\r\nEngland in regard to the Quakers, as in respect to the Baptists, the\r\nEpiscopalians, and the elective franchise. The agents of the colony in\r\nEngland were instructed to state that the \"severe laws to prevent the\r\nviolent and impetuous intrusions of the Quakers had been suspended;\"\r\nbut they did not say that laws less severe had been substituted, and\r\nthat fines and imprisonments were imposed upon any party who should be\r\npresent at a Quakers' meeting. Yet, as late as 1677, the Court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay made a law \"That every person found at a Quakers'\r\nmeeting shall be apprehended, _ex officio_, by the constable, and by\r\nwarrant from a magistrate or commissioner shall be committed to the\r\nHouse of Correction, and there have the discipline of the house applied\r\nto him, and be kept to work, with bread and water, for three days, and\r\nthen released, or else shall pay five pounds in money as a fine to the\r\ncountry for such offence; and all constables neglecting their duty in\r\nnot faithfully executing this order, shall incur the penalty of five\r\npounds upon conviction, one-third thereof to the informer.\"[176]\r\n\r\nThey likewise instructed their agents in England to give assurance \"That\r\nthe Acts of Trade, so far as they concerned the colony, should be\r\nstrictly observed, and that all due encouragement and assistance should\r\nbe given to his Majesty's officers and informers that might prosecute\r\nthe breaches of said Acts of Trade and Navigation.\"[177] But while as a\r\nCourt they professed this in their records and through their agents in\r\nEngland, officers were elected in the colony who would not execute the\r\nlaw, and so not a farthing of duties was collected under it at\r\nMassachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nThus for twenty years the rulers of Massachusetts Bay resisted and\r\nevaded the six conditions on which King Charles the Second, after his\r\nrestoration, proposed to overlook and pardon their past offences and\r\nperpetuate the Charter given to them by his Royal father; for twenty\r\nyears the King, without committing a single unconstitutional or\r\noppressive act against them, or without demanding anything which Queen\r\nVictoria does not receive, this day, from every colony of the British\r\nEmpire, endured their evasions and denials of his authority and insults\r\nof his Commissioners and officers. In all the despatches of the King's\r\nGovernment to the rulers of Massachusetts Bay, during these twenty\r\nyears, as the reader of the preceding pages will have seen, the spirit\r\nof kindness, and a full recognition of their rights in connection with\r\nthose of the Crown, were predominant.\r\n\r\nThis they repeatedly acknowledged in their addresses to the King. They\r\npretended the Royal Charter gave them absolute independence; and on that\r\nabsurd interpretation and lawless assumption they maintained a\r\ncontinuous contest with the mother country for more than fifty years.\r\nEvery party in England, and the Commonwealth as well as Royalty,\r\nmaintained the right of King and Parliament to be the supreme tribunal\r\nof appeal and control in America as well as in England; while the rulers\r\nof Massachusetts Bay Colony alone, in contradistinction to all the other\r\nBritish colonies in America, denied in short the authority of both King\r\nand Parliament, though often amidst wordy professions of personal\r\nloyalty to the Throne. Mr. Bancroft well sums up the history of\r\nMassachusetts pretensions and intolerance in the sentences:\r\n\"Massachusetts owned no King but the King of Heaven.\" \"Massachusetts\r\ngave franchises to the members of the visible Church,\" but \"inexorably\r\ndisfranchised Churchmen, Royalists, and all the world's people.\" \"In\r\nMassachusetts, the songs of Deborah and David were sung without change;\r\nhostile Algonquins like the Canaanites were exterminated or enslaved;\r\nand a peevish woman was hanged, because it was written, 'The witch shall\r\ndie.'\"[178]\r\n\r\nNo hostile pen ever presented in so few and expressive words the\r\ncharacter and policy of the Government of Massachusetts Bay during the\r\nwhole existence of the first Charter, as is presented in these words of\r\ntheir eulogist Bancroft; and these words express the causes of their\r\ncontests with the Crown and Parliament, of their proscription and\r\npersecution of the majority of their fellow-colonists not of their\r\npolitics or form of worship, and of their dealing at pleasure with the\r\nterritories of their neighbours,[179] and the lands and lives of the\r\nIndian tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: The captain of a ship brought the news from England in\r\nJuly, that the King had been proclaimed, but a false rumour was\r\ncirculated that the Government in England was in a very unsettled state,\r\nthe body of the people dissatisfied; that the Scotch had demanded work;\r\nthat Lord Fairfax was at the head of a great army, etc. Such a rumour\r\nwas so congenial to the feelings of the men who had been lauding\r\nCromwell, that when it was proposed in the General Court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, in the October following, to address the King, the\r\nmajority refused to do so. They awaited to see which party would prevail\r\nin England, so as to pay court to it. On the 30th of November a ship\r\narrived from Bristol, bringing news of the utter falsity of the rumours\r\nabout the unsettled state of things and popular dissatisfaction in\r\nEngland, and of the proceedings of Parliament; and letters were received\r\nfrom their agent, Mr. Leverett, that petitions and complaints were\r\npreferred against the colony to the King in Council. Then the Governor\r\nand assistants called a meeting of the General Court, December 9th, when\r\na very loyal address to the King was presently agreed upon, and another\r\nto the two Houses of Parliament. Letters were sent to Sir Thomas Temple,\r\nto Lord Manchester, Lord Say and Seal, and to other persons of note,\r\npraying them to intercede in behalf of the colony. A most gracious\r\nanswer was given to the address by the King's letter, dated February 15,\r\n1660 (1661, new style), which was the first public act or order\r\nconcerning them after the restoration. (Hutchinson's History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 210, 211.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp.\r\n211, 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Holmes' Annals of America, Vol. I., p. 318. Hutchinson,\r\nVol. I., p. 216. Hazard, Vol. II., pp. 593-595. The address is a\r\ncuriosity in its way, and a strange medley which I must leave the reader\r\nto characterize in view of the facts involved. The following are the\r\nprincipal passages of it:\r\n\r\nExtracts from the Massachusetts General Court--Address to the King,\r\ndated 19th December, 1660:\r\n\r\n\"To the High and Mighty Prince, Charles the Second, by the grace of God,\r\nKing of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.\r\n\r\n\"Most gracious and dread Sovereign:\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Majesty--In the day wherein you happily say you know\r\nyou are King over your British Israel, to cast a favourable eye upon\r\nyour poore Mephiboseth now, and by reason of lameness in respect of\r\ndistance, not until now appearing in your presence, we mean upon New\r\nEngland, kneeling with the rest of your subjects before your Majesty as\r\nher restored King. We forget not our ineptness as to those approaches;\r\nwe at present owne such impotence as renders us unable to excuse our\r\nimpotency of speaking unto our Lord the King; yet contemplating such a\r\nKing, who hath also seen adversity, that he knoweth the hearts of\r\nexiles, who himself hath been an exile, the aspect of Majesty\r\nextraordinarily influenced animateth exanimated outcasts, yet outcasts\r\nas we hope for the truth, to make this address unto our Prince, hoping\r\nto find grace in your sight. We present this script, the transcript of\r\nour loyall hearts, wherein we crave leave to supplicate your Majesty for\r\nyour gracious protection of us in the continuance both of our civill and\r\nreligious liberties (according to the grantees known, and of suing for\r\nthe patent) conferred on this Plantation by your royal father. This,\r\nviz., our libertie to walk in the faith of the gospell, was the cause of\r\nour transporting ourselves, with our wives, little ones, and our\r\nsubstances, from that over the Atlantick ocean, into the vast\r\nwilderness, choosing rather the pure Scripture worship with a good\r\nconscience in this remote wilderness among the heathen, than the\r\npleasures of England with submission to _the impositions_ of the _then_\r\nso disposed and so far _prevailing hierarchy_, which we could not do\r\nwithout an evil conscience.\" \"Our witness is in heaven that we left not\r\nour native country upon any dissatisfaction as to the constitution of\r\nthe civil state. Our lot after the good old nonconformists hath been\r\nonly to _act a passive part throughout these late vicissitudes_ and\r\nsuccessive turnings of States. Our separation from our brethren in this\r\ndesert hath been and is a sufficient bringing to mind the afflictions of\r\nJoseph.

Manchester had not taken any part\r\nin public affairs since the passing of the self-denying ordinances. He\r\nwas still a Presbyterian, but had favoured the return of the King. Lord\r\nSay, also, had long since withdrawn from public life, and though of a\r\nless pliant temper than Manchester, his new friends had no reason to\r\ndoubt his steady adherence to the new order of things.

And because the licence of these late ill times has likewise\r\nhad an influence upon our colony, in which they have swerved from the\r\nrules prescribed, and even from the government instituted by the\r\ncharter, which we do graciously impute rather to the iniquity of the\r\ntime than to the evil intents of the hearts of those who exercised the\r\ngovernment there. And we do therefore publish and declare our free and\r\ngracious pardon to all our subjects of that our plantation, for all\r\ncrimes and offences committed against us during the late troubles,\r\nexcept any persons who stand attainted by our parliament here of high\r\ntreason, if any such persons have transported themselves into these\r\nparts; the apprehending of whom and delivering them into the hands of\r\njustice, we expect from the dutiful and affectionate obedience of those\r\nof our good subjects in that colony, if they be found within the\r\njurisdiction thereof. Provided always, and be it our declared\r\nexpectation, that upon a review of all such laws and ordinances that are\r\nnow or have been during these late troubles in practice there, and which\r\nare contrary or derogatory to our authority and government, the same may\r\nbe annulled and repealed, and the rules and prescriptions of the said\r\ncharter for administering and taking the oath of allegiance be\r\nhenceforth duly observed, and that the administrations of justice be in\r\nour name. And since the principle and foundation of that charter was and\r\nis the freedom of liberty of conscience, We do hereby charge and require\r\nyou that freedom and liberty be duly admitted and allowed, so that they\r\nthat desire to use the book of common prayer and performe their devotion\r\nin that manner that is established here be not denied the exercise\r\nthereof, or undergoe any prejudice or disadvantage thereby, they using\r\ntheir liberty peaceably without any disturbances to others; and that all\r\npersons of good and honest lives and conversations be admitted to the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the said Book of Common\r\nPrayer, and their children to baptism.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Indeed, so conscious were they that they had justly\r\nforfeited all consideration from the King, that the first address\r\nextracted from them when they found the monarchy firmly established,\r\nexpressed deep humiliation and confession, and implored the forgiveness\r\nand favour of their Sovereign; and being sensible of the many and\r\nwell-founded complaints made against them by the victims of their\r\npersecuting intolerance, they appointed two of their ablest and most\r\ntrusted members--Simon Bradstreet, an old magistrate, and John Norton, a\r\nminister of Boston--to proceed to England to present their address, to\r\nintercede for them, and secure the interest of those of their old\r\nfriends who might have influence with the King and his councillors. But\r\nas Bradstreet and Norton had both been persecutors of their\r\nEpiscopalian, Presbyterian, and Baptist brethren, and were conspicuous\r\nin promoting the bloody persecutions of the Quakers (now getting a\r\nfavourable hearing for their sufferings at the English Court), they were\r\nunwilling to undertake so difficult and hazardous a mission without\r\nformal provision being made by the Massachusetts Court for indemnity for\r\nall the damage they might incur.\r\n\r\n\"At length,\" says their historian, \"the Committee appointed to do\r\neverything for their dispatch in the recess of the Court, 'engaged to\r\nmake good all damages they might sustain by the detention of their\r\npersons in England, or otherwise.' They departed the 10th of February\r\n(1662.)\r\n\r\n\"Their reception in England was much more favourable than was expected;\r\ntheir stay short, returning the next autumn with the King's most\r\ngracious letter, some parts of which cheered the hearts of the country;\r\nand they then looked upon and afterwards recurred to them as a\r\nconfirmation of their charter privileges, and an amnesty of all past\r\nerrors. The letter was ordered to be published (as the King had\r\ndirected), and in an order for public thanksgiving, particular notice is\r\ntaken of 'the return of the messengers, and the continuance of the\r\nmercies of peace, liberties, and the Gospel.'\"\r\n\r\nThe early New England historian, Hubbard, says: \"They returned like\r\nNoah's dove, with an olive branch of peace in their mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were some things, however, in the King's letter hard to comply\r\nwith; and though it was ordered to be published, yet it was with this\r\ncaution, that 'inasmuch as the letter hath influence upon the Churches\r\nas well as the civil state, all manner of acting in relation thereto\r\nshall be suspended until the next General Court, that all persons may\r\nhave opportunity to consider what was necessary to be done, in order to\r\nknow his Majesty's pleasure therein.'\" (Hutchinson's History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 221, 222.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: So dissatisfied were these Congregational \"freemen\" with\r\nthe conditions which were intended to put an end to their persecutions\r\nof their brethren and their disloyal practices, that they denounced\r\ntheir old friends and representatives to England, Messrs. Bradstreet and\r\nNorton, for those conditions which they could not prevent, and upon\r\nwhich they might well be thankful to preserve the Charter and obtain\r\npardon for their past offences. Their historian says: \"The agents met\r\nwith the fate of most agents ever since. The favours they obtained were\r\nsupposed to be no more than might well have been expected, and their\r\nmerits were soon forgot; the evils which they had it not in their power\r\nto prevent, were attributed to their neglect or unnecessary concessions.\r\nMr. Bradstreet was a man of more phlegm and not so sensibly touched, but\r\nMr. Norton was so affected that he grew melancholy; and died suddenly\r\nsoon after his return (April 5, 1633).\" (Hutchinson's History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 223.)\r\n\r\nIn a note the historian quotes the remark of Mr. Norton to the\r\nMassachusetts Court, that \"if they complied not with the King's letter,\r\nthe blood that should be spilt would lie at their door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mather says upon this occasion: 'Such has been the jealous\r\ndisposition of our New Englanders about their dearly bought privileges,\r\nand such also has been the various interpretations of the people about\r\nthe extent of their privileges, that of all the agents sent over to the\r\nCourt of England for now forty years together, I know of not one who did\r\nnot, at his return, meet with some forward entertainment among his\r\ncountrymen.'\" (_Ib._, p. 222.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Mr. Hildreth gives the following account of this mission\r\nand its results upon the state of society in Massachusetts Bay Colony\r\nand its agents to England:\r\n\r\n\"The Massachusetts' agents presently returned, bearers of a royal\r\nletter, in which the King recognized the Charter and promised oblivion\r\nof past offences. But he demanded the repeal of all laws inconsistent\r\nwith his due authority; an oath of allegiance to the royal person, as\r\nformerly in use, but dropped since the commencement of the late civil\r\nwar; the administration of justice in his name; complete toleration for\r\nthe Church of England; the repeal of the law which restricted the\r\nprivilege of voting, and tenure of office to Church members, and the\r\nsubstitution of property qualification instead; finally, the admission\r\nof all persons of honest lives to the sacraments of Baptism and the\r\nLord's Supper.\r\n\r\n\"The claimants for toleration, formerly suppressed with such prompt\r\nseverity, were now encouraged, by the King's demands in their favour,\r\nagain to raise their heads. For the next thirty years the people of\r\nMassachusetts (Bay) were divided into three parties, a very decided,\r\nthough gradually diminishing majority (of the Congregationalists, the\r\nonly \"freemen\") sustaining with ardour the theocratic system, and, as\r\nessential to it, entire independence of external control. At the\r\nopposite extreme, a party, small in numbers and feeble in influence\r\n(among the \"freemen\"), advocated religious toleration--at least to a\r\nlimited extent--and equal civil rights for all inhabitants. They\r\nadvocated, also, the supremacy of the Crown, sole means in that day of\r\ncurbing the theocracy, and compelling it to yield its monopoly of power.\r\nTo this party belonged the Episcopalians, or those inclined to become\r\nso; the Baptists, Presbyterians, the Quakers, and other sectaries who\r\nfeared less the authority of a distant monarch than the present rule of\r\ntheir watchful and bitter spiritual rivals. In the intermediate was a\r\nthird party, weak at first but daily growing stronger, and drawing to\r\nits ranks, one after another, some former zealous advocates of the\r\nexclusive system, convinced that a _theocracy_, in its stricter form,\r\nwas no longer tenable, and some of them, perhaps, beginning to be\r\nsatisfied that it was not desirable. Among the earliest of these were\r\nNorton and Bradstreet, the agents who came back from England impressed\r\nwith the necessity of yielding. But the avowal of such sentiments was\r\nfatal to their popularity (among the Congregational \"freemen\"), and\r\nNorton, accustomed to nothing but reverence and applause, finding\r\nhimself now looked at with distrust, soon died of melancholy and\r\nmortification.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap.\r\nxiv., pp. 455, 456.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Collection of Massachusetts, etc., Civil Society, Vol.\r\nVIII., Second Series, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Collections of Massachusetts, etc., Civil Society, _Vol_.\r\nVIII., Second Series, pp. 59, 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: From the representations made respecting the state of\r\naffairs in the New England colonies, the appointment of this Commission\r\nwas decided upon after the restoration of the King, and the agents of\r\nthose colonies were informed of it. Col. Nichols, the head of the\r\nCommission, stated in his introductory address to the Massachusetts Bay\r\nCourt, May 2, 1665, that \"The King himself and the Lord Chancellor\r\n(Clarendon) told Mr. Norton and Mr. Bradstreet of this colony, and Mr.\r\nWinthrop of Connecticut, Mr. Clarke of Rhode Island, and several others\r\nnow in these countries, that he intended shortly to send over\r\nCommissioners.\" (_Ib._, p. 56.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: It was in refutation of such reports that Col. Nichols\r\nmade the statements quoted on a previous page; in the course of which,\r\nreferring to the slanders circulated by persons high in office under the\r\nCourt, he said: \"Some of them are these: That the King hath sent us over\r\nhere to raise _£5,000 a year out of the colony_ for his Majesty's use,\r\nand 12d. for every acre of improved land besides, and to take from this\r\ncolony many of their civil liberties and ecclesiastical privileges, of\r\nwhich particulars we have been asked the truth in several places, all of\r\nwhich reports we did, and here do, disclaim as false; and protest that\r\nthey are diametrically contrary to the truth, as ere long we shall make\r\nit appear more plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"These personal slanders with which we are calumniated, as private men\r\nwe slight; as Christians we forgive and will not mention; but as persons\r\nemployed by his Sacred Majesty, we cannot suffer his honour to be\r\neclipsed by a cloud of black reproaches, and some seditious speeches,\r\nwithout demanding justice from you against those who have raised,\r\nreported, or made them.\" (_Ib._, p. 56.)\r\n\r\nThese reports were spread by some of the chief officers of the Council,\r\nand the most seditious of the speeches complained of was by the\r\ncommander of their forces; but they were too agreeable to the Court for\r\nthem even to contradict, much less investigate, although Col. Nichols\r\noffered to give their names.\r\n\r\nHubbard, the earliest and most learned of the New England historians,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The Commissioners were but four in number, the two principal of whom\r\nwere Colonel Nichols and Colonel Cartwright, who were both of them\r\neminently qualified, with abilities fit to manage such a concern, nor\r\nyet wanting in resolution to carry on any honourable design for the\r\npromotion of his Majesty's interest in any of those Plantations whither\r\nthey were sent.\" (Massachusetts History Collection, Vol. V., Second\r\nSeries, p. 577.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: The following is a copy of the Royal Commission, in which\r\nthe reasons and objects of it are explicitly stated:\r\n\r\n\"Copy of a Commission from King Charles the Second to Col.

All forms of justice pass only in his\r\nMajesty's name; they admit all that desire to be of their corporation;\r\nthey will not hinder any from enjoying the sacraments and using the\r\nCommon Prayer Book, provided that they hinder not the maintenance of the\r\npublic minister. They will amend anything that hath been done derogatory\r\nto his Majesty's honour, if there be any such thing, so soon as they\r\nshall come to the knowledge of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence_ Plantations returned their\r\nhumble thanks to his Majesty for sending Commissioners, and made great\r\ndemonstration of their loyalty and obedience. They approved as most\r\nreasonable, that appeals should be made to his Majesty's Commissioners,\r\nwho, having heard and determined some cases among them, referred other\r\nsome in civility to their General Court, and some to the Governor and\r\nothers; some of which cases they again remitted to the Commissioners to\r\ndetermine. All proceedings are in his Majesty's name; they admit all to\r\nbe freemen who desire it; they allow liberty of conscience and worship\r\nto all who live civilly; and if any can inform of anything in their laws\r\nor practices derogatory to his Majesty's honour, they will amend it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Colony of New Plymouth_ did submit to have appeals made to the\r\nCommissioners, who have heard but one plaint made to them, which was\r\nthat the Governor would not let a man enjoy a farm four miles square,\r\nwhich he had bought of an Indian. The complainant soon submitted to the\r\nGovernor when he understood the unreasonableness of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Colony of Massachusetts Bay_ was the hardest to be persuaded to\r\nuse his Majesty's name in the forms of justice. In this colony, at the\r\nfirst coming of the Commissioners, were many untruths raised and sent\r\ninto the colonies, as that the King had to raise £15,000 yearly for his\r\nMajesty's use, whereupon Major Hawthorne made a seditious speech at the\r\nhead of his company, and the late Governor (Bellingham) another at their\r\nmeeting-house at Boston, but neither of them were so much as questioned\r\nfor it by any of the magistrates.\" ... \"But neither examples nor reasons\r\ncould prevail with them to let the Commissioners hear and determine so\r\nmuch as those particular cases (Mr. Deane's and the Indian Sachems),\r\nwhich the King had commanded them to take care of and do justice in; and\r\nthough the Commissioners, who never desired that they should appear as\r\ndelinquents, but as _defendants_, either by themselves or by their\r\nattorneys, assured them that if they had been unjustly complained of to\r\nhis Majesty, their false accusers should be severely punished, and their\r\njust dealing made known to his Majesty and all the world; yet they\r\nproclaimed by sound of trumpet that the General Court was the supremest\r\njudiciary in all the province; that the Commissioners pretending to hear\r\nappeals was a breach of the privileges granted by the King's royal\r\nfather, and confirmed to them by his Majesty's own letter, and that they\r\nwould not permit it; by which they have for the present silenced above\r\nthirty petitioners which desired justice from them and were lost at sea.\r\n\r\n\"To elude his Majesty's desire for admitting men of civil and competent\r\nestates to be freemen, they have an Act whereby he that is 24 years old,\r\na housekeeper, and brings a certificate of his civil life, another of\r\nhis being orthodox in matters of faith, and a third of his paying ten\r\nshillings besides head-money, at a single rate, _may then have the\r\nliberty to make his desires known to the Court_, and then it shall be\r\nput to vote. The Commissioners examined many townships, and found that\r\nscarce three in a hundred pay ten shillings at a single rate; yet if\r\nthis rate were general it would be just; but he that is _a church\r\nmember, though_ he be a servant, and pay not _twopence, may be a\r\nfreeman_. They do not admit any who is not a Church member to communion,\r\nnor their children to baptism, yet they will marry their children to\r\nthose whom they will not admit to baptism, if they be rich. They did\r\nimprison and barbarously use Mr. Jourdan for baptising children, as\r\nhimself complained in his petition to the Commissioners. Those whom they\r\nwill not admit to the communion, they compel to come to their sermons by\r\nforcing from them five shillings for every neglect; yet these men\r\nthought their paying one shilling for not coming to prayers in England\r\nwas an unsupportable tyranny.\" ... \"They have made many things in their\r\nlaws derogatory to his Majesty's honour, of which the Commissioners have\r\nmade and desired that they might be altered, but they have done nothing\r\nof it[134]. Among others, whoever keeps Christmas Day is to pay a fine\r\nof five pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"They caused at length a map of the territories to be made; but it was\r\nmade in a Chamber by direction and guess; in it they claim Fort Albany,\r\nand beyond it all the land to the South Sea. By their South Sea line\r\nthey entrench upon the colonies of New Plymouth, Rhode Island and\r\nConnecticut; and on the east they usurped Capt. Mason's and Sir\r\nFerdinardo Gorges' patents, and said that the Commissioners had nothing\r\nto do betwixt them and Mr. Gorges, because his Majesty neither commanded\r\nthem to deliver possession to Mr. Gorges or to give his Majesty reason\r\nwhy they did not.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"They of this colony say that King Charles the First granted to them a\r\nCharter as a warrant against himself and his successors, and that so\r\nlong as they pay the fifth part of the gold and silver ore which they\r\nget, they shall be free to use the privileges granted them, and that\r\nthey are not obliged to the King except by civility; they hope by\r\nwriting to tire the King, Lord Chancellor, and Secretaries too; seven\r\nyears they can easily spin out by writing, and before that time a change\r\nmay come; nay, some have dared to say, who knows what the event of this\r\nDutch war will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"This colony furnished Cromwell with many instruments out of their\r\ncorporation and college; and those that have retreated thither since his\r\nMajesty's happy return, are much respected, and many advanced to be\r\nmagistrates.

He was the\r\nprimary cause of the disputes between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and\r\nthe Parent Government, and the unrelenting persecutor of all who\r\ndiffered from him in religious worship. He was hostile to monarchy and\r\nall English authority from the beginning; he got and kept the elective\r\nfranchise, and eligibility to office, in the hands of the\r\nCongregationalists alone, and became of course their idol.\r\n\r\nThe King's suggesting the election of a Governor other than Endicot was\r\na refutation of their statements that he intended to deprive them of\r\ntheir local self-government. The following is Neal's notice of the death\r\nof Mr. Endicot: \"On the 23rd of March, 1665, died Mr. John Endicot,\r\nGovernor of the Jurisdiction of Massachusetts. He arrived at Salem in\r\nthe year 1628, and had the chief command of those that first settled\r\nthere, and shared with them in all their hardships. He continued at\r\nSalem till the magistrates desired him to remove to Boston for the more\r\nconvenient administration of justice, as Governor of the Jurisdiction,\r\nto which he was frequently elected for many years together. He was a\r\ngreat enemy of the Sectaries, and was too severe in executing the penal\r\nlaws against the Quakers and _Anabaptists_ during the time of his\r\nadministration. He lived to a good old age, and was interred at Boston\r\nwith great honour and solemnity.\"--Neal's History of New England Vol.\r\nII., p. 346.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: The same year, 1662, in which Charles the Second sent so\r\ngracious a letter to the Governor and Council of Massachusetts Bay, he\r\ngranted Charters to the colonies of Connecticut and Rhode Island, in\r\nboth of which perfect liberty of conscience and religious liberty was\r\nencouraged and provided for, evincing the settled policy of the\r\nGovernment of the Restoration in regard to the New England colonies. The\r\nannalist Holmes says:\r\n\r\n\"1662.--The Charter of Connecticut was granted by Charles II. with most\r\nample privileges, under the great seal of England. It was ordained by\r\nthe Charter that all the King's subjects in the colony should enjoy all\r\nthe privileges of free and natural born subjects within the realm of\r\nEngland.\" (Holmes' Annals, etc., Vol. I., pp. 320, 321.)\r\n\r\nSo liberal were the provisions of this Charter, that as Judge Story\r\nsays: \"It continued to be the fundamental law of the State of\r\nConnecticut until the year 1818, when a new constitution of government\r\nwas framed and adopted by the people.\" (Commentaries on the Constitution\r\nof the United States, Vol. I., Sec. 88.)\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island._--Rhode Island had two English Charters, the\r\ncircumstances connected with both of which were very peculiar. Its\r\nfounder, Roger Williams, had been banished from the jurisdiction of\r\nMassachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\n\"Rhode Island,\" says Judge Story, \"was originally settled by emigrants\r\nfrom Massachusetts, fleeing hither to escape from religious persecution,\r\nand it still boasts of Roger Williams as its founder and as the early\r\ndefender of religious freedom and the rights of conscience. One body of\r\nthem purchased the island which gave name to the State, and another the\r\nterritory of the Providence Plantations from the Indians, and began\r\ntheir settlements at the same period, in 1636 and 1638. They entered\r\ninto separate associations of government. But finding their associations\r\nnot sufficient to protect them _against the encroachments of\r\nMassachusetts_, and having no title under any royal patents, they sent\r\nRoger Williams to England in 1643 to procure a surer foundation both of\r\ntitle and government. He succeeded in obtaining from the Earl of Warwick\r\n(in 1643) a Charter of incorporation of Providence Plantations; and also\r\nin 1644 a Charter from the two Houses of Parliament (Charles the First\r\nbeing driven from his capital) for the incorporation of the towns of\r\nProvidence, Newport, and Portsmouth, for the absolute government of\r\nthemselves, but according to the laws of England.\"\r\n\r\nBut such was the hostility of the rulers of Massachusetts Bay that they\r\nrefused to admit Rhode Island into the confederacy of the New England\r\ncolonies formed in 1643 to defend themselves against the Indians, the\r\nSpanish, the Dutch, and the French; yet they had influence enough with\r\nCromwell to get the Charter of Rhode Island suspended in 1652. \"But,\"\r\nsays Dr. Holmes, \"that colony, taking advantage of the distractions\r\nwhich soon after ensued in England, resumed its government and enjoyed\r\nit without further interruption until the Restoration.\" (Holmes' Annals,\r\netc., Vol. I., p. 297.)\r\n\r\n\"The restoration of Charles the Second,\" says Judge Story, \"seems to\r\nhave given great satisfaction to these Plantations. They immediately\r\nproclaimed the King and sent an agent to England; and in July, 1663,\r\nafter some opposition, they succeeded in obtaining a Charter from the\r\nCrown.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable circumstance in the Charter, and that which\r\nexhibits the strong feeling and spirit of the colony, is the provision\r\nfor _religious freedom_. The Charter, after reciting the petition of the\r\ninhabitants, 'that it is much in their hearts (if they may be permitted)\r\nto hold forth a lively experiment, that a most flourishing civil state\r\nmay stand, and be _best maintained, and that among English subjects with\r\nfull liberty_ in religious concernments, and that true piety, rightly\r\ngrounded upon Gospel principles, will give the least and greatest\r\nsecurity to sovereignty,' proceeds to declare:\r\n\r\n\"'We being willing to encourage the hopeful undertaking of our said\r\nloyal and loving subjects, and to secure them in the free exercise of\r\nall their civil and religious rights appertaining to them as our loving\r\nsubjects, and to preserve to them that liberty in the true Christian\r\nfaith and worship of God which they have sought with so much travail and\r\nwith peaceful minds and loyal subjection to our progenitors and\r\nourselves to enjoy; and because some of the people and inhabitants of\r\nthe same colony cannot, in their private opinion, conform to the public\r\nexercise of religion according to the liturgy, form, and ceremonies of\r\nthe Church of England, or take or subscribe to the oaths and articles\r\nmade and established in that behalf; and for that the same, by reason of\r\nthe remote distances of these places, will, as we hope, be no breach of\r\nthe unity and uniformity established in this nation, have therefore\r\nthought fit, and do hereby publicly grant and ordain and declare, that\r\nour royal will and pleasure is, that _no person within the said colony_,\r\nat any time hereafter, shall be any wise molested, punished, disquieted,\r\nor called in question for any differences in opinion on matters of\r\nreligion, but that all and every person and persons may, from time to\r\ntime, and at all times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his\r\nand their own judgment and conveniences in matters of religious\r\nconcernment throughout the tract of land hereafter mentioned, they\r\nbehaving themselves peaceably and quietly, and not using this liberty to\r\nlicentiousness and profaneness, nor to the civil injury or outward\r\ndisturbance of others.'\" (Hazard's Collection, p. 613.)\r\n\r\nJudge Story, after quoting this declaration of the Royal Charter, justly\r\nremarks, \"This is a noble declaration, worthy of any Prince who rules\r\nover a free people. It is lamentable to reflect how little it comports\r\nwith the domestic persecutions authorized by the same monarch during his\r\nprofligate reign. It is still more lamentable to reflect how little a\r\nsimilar spirit of toleration was encouraged, either by precept or\r\nexample, in other of the New England Colonies.\" (Commentaries, etc.,\r\nVol. I., Chap, viii., Section 97.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol.\r\nVIII., Second Series, p. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol.\r\nVIII., Second Series, pp. 76-78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol.\r\nVIII., Second Series, pp. 76, 78, 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Danforth Papers, Collections of Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, Vol. VIII., pp. 98, 108, 109, Second Series.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars are given of the proceedings of the Court at a\r\nsubsequent meeting on the same subject:\r\n\r\n\"October 10th, 1666.

Those for sending none spake out fully that they would have the\r\nGovernor (Mr. Bellingham) and Major Hawthorne go; but some will have men\r\ngo to plead our cause with his Majesty; to answer what may be alleged\r\nagainst us, alleging reason, religion and our own necessity as forcing\r\nus thereto. Others are against it, as being the loss of all, by\r\nendangering a _quo warranto_ to be brought against our patent, and so to\r\nbe condemned; a middle sort would have some go to present the Court's\r\npresent to his Majesty, of two large masts and a ship's load of masts:\r\nand in case any demand were made why the Governor, Major Hawthorne, and\r\nothers did not appear, to crave his Majesty's favour therein, and to\r\nplead with his Majesty, showing how inconsistent it is with our being,\r\nfor any to be forced to appear to answer in a judicial way in\r\nEngland--to answer either appeals or complaints against the country.\r\n\r\n\"The last proposal is obstructed by sundry, as being ruinous to the\r\nwhole; and so nothing can be done, the Governor and some others chiefly\r\nopposing it, so as that no orderly debate can be had to know the mind of\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\n\"The Court agreed to send two large masts aboard Capt. Pierce, 34 yards\r\nlong, and the one 36 and the other 37 inches in diameter, and agreed to\r\nlevy £1,000 for the payment of what is needful at present; but is\r\nobstructed--none will lend money unless men be sent, others because\r\nanything is to be sent; a return whereof made to the Court, they say\r\nthey know not what to do more--in case they that have money will not\r\npart with it, they are at a stand. Some speak of raising by rate\r\nimmediately. Others think there is so much dissatisfaction that men are\r\nnot sent, that it will provoke and raise a tumult; and in case that it\r\nbe raised by loan, it will be hardly paid--if consent be not given in\r\ntheir sending men with it, and there be no good effect, which is\r\ncontingent, and thus we are every way at a stand; some fearing these\r\nthings will precipitate our ruin, and others apprehending that to act\r\nfurther will necessitate our ruin.\"--_Ib._, pp. 110, 111.\r\n\r\nFrom these notes, which Mr. Danforth made at the time when the\r\nproceedings referred to took place, it is plain there were a large\r\nnumber of loyalists even among the Congregationalists, as they alone\r\nwere eligible to be members of, or to elect to the Court, and that the\r\nasserters of independence were greatly perplexed and agitated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Danforth Papers, Collections of Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, Vol. VIII., pp. 99, 100, 108, 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: \"There had been a press for printing at Cambridge for\r\nnear twenty years.

They were sincere but mistaken in their principles;\r\nand absurd as it is, it is too evident, they believed it to be to the\r\nglory of God to take away the lives of his creatures for maintaining\r\ntenets contrary to what they professed themselves.

These our letters are to\r\naccompany our trusty and well beloved William Stoughton and Peter\r\nBulkly, Esqres., your agents, who having manifested to us great\r\nnecessity in their domestic concerns to return back into New England, we\r\nhave graciously consented thereunto, and the rather because for many\r\nmonths past our Council hath been taken up in the discovery and\r\nprosecution of a popish plot, and yet there appears little prospect of\r\nany speedy leisure for entering upon such regulation in your affairs as\r\nis certainly necessary, not only in respect of our dignity, but of your\r\nown perfect settlement. In the meantime, we doubt not but the bearers\r\nthereof, who have demeaned themselves, during their attendance, with\r\ngood care and discretion, will, from their _own observations_, acquaint\r\nyou with many important things which may be of such use and\r\nadvertisement to you, that we might well hope to be prevented, by your\r\napplications, in what is expected or desired by us. So much it is your\r\ninterest to propose and intercede for the same; for we are graciously\r\ninclined to have all past errors and mistakes forgotten, and that your\r\ncondition might be so amended as that neither your settlement, or the\r\nminds of our good subjects there, should be liable to be shaken and\r\ndisquieted upon every complaint. We have heard with satisfaction of the\r\ngreat readiness wherewith our good subjects there have lately offered\r\nthemselves to the taking of the oath of allegiance, which is a clear\r\nmanifestation to us that the unanswerable defect in that particular was\r\nbut the fault of a very few in power, who for so long a time obstructed\r\nwhat the Charter and our express commands obliged them unto, as will\r\nappear in our gracious letter of the 28th of June (1662), in the\r\nfourteenth year of our reign; and we shall henceforth expect that there\r\nwill be a suitable obedience in other particulars of the said letter,\r\nas, namely, in respect of freedom and liberty of conscience, so as those\r\nthat desire to serve God in the way of the Church of England be not\r\nthereby made obnoxious or discountenanced from their sharing in the\r\ngovernment, much less that they or any other of our good subjects (not\r\nbeing Papists) who do not agree in the Congregational way, be by law\r\nsubjected to fines or forfeitures, or other incapacities for the same,\r\nwhich is a severity to be the more wondered at, whereas liberty of\r\nconscience was made one principal motive for your first transportation\r\ninto those parts; nor do we think it fit that any other distinction be\r\nobserved in the making of freemen than that they be men of competent\r\nestates, rateable at ten shillings,[162] according to the rules of the\r\nplace, and that such in their turns be also capable of the magistracy,\r\nand all laws made void that obstruct the same. And because we have not\r\nobserved any fruits or advantage by the dispensation granted by us in\r\nour said letter of June, in the fourteenth year of our reign, whereby\r\nthe number of assistants, settled by our Charter to be eighteen, might\r\nbe reduced unto the number of ten, our will and pleasure is that the\r\nancient number of eighteen be henceforth observed, according to the\r\nletter of the Charter.

The above quoted clauses\r\nof their law passed in 1667, nearly fifty years after the establishment\r\nof their government, illustrate their ideas of individual liberty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: Palfrey, Vol. III., p. 353. Much has been written about\r\nthese Acts of Trade and Navigation, as if they were acts of royal\r\ndespotism and designed to oppress the colonies for the benefit of\r\nEngland; whereas they originated with the Commonwealth, and were\r\ndesigned to benefit the colonies as well as the mother country. \"After\r\nthe decapitation of Charles I.,\" says Minot, \"the confused situation of\r\nEngland prevented any particular attention to the colony until\r\nCromwell's Government. The very qualities which existed in the character\r\nof the inhabitants to render them displeasing to the late King, operated\r\nas much with the Protector in their favour; and he diverted all\r\ncomplaints of their enemies against them. Yet he procured the Navigation\r\nAct to be passed by the Parliament, which was a source of future\r\ndifficulty to the colony, though it was evaded in New England at first\r\n(by Cromwell's connivance with the rulers of Massachusetts Colony), as\r\nthey still traded in all parts and enjoyed a privilege, peculiar to\r\nthemselves, of importing their goods into England free of all customs.\"\r\n(Minot's Continuation of the History of Massachusetts Bay, published\r\naccording to Act of Congress, Vol. I., p. 40.)\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth, referring to the early part of Charles the Second's\r\nrestoration, says: \"As yet the Acts of Trade were hardly a subject of\r\ncontroversy. The Parliament, which had welcomed back the King, had\r\nindeed re-enacted with additional clauses the ordinance of 1651--an Act\r\nwhich, by restricting exportations from America to English, Irish, and\r\nColonial vessels, substantially excluded foreign ships from all\r\nAnglo-American harbours. To this, which might be regarded as a benefit\r\nto New England ship-owners, a provision was added still further to\r\nisolate the colonies (from foreign countries), the more valuable\r\ncolonial staples, mentioned by the name, and hence known as 'enumerated\r\narticles,' being required to be shipped exclusively to England or some\r\nEnglish colony. The exportation to the colonies was also prohibited of\r\nany product of Europe, unless in English vessels and from England,\r\nexcept horses, servants and provisions from Ireland and Scotland. But of\r\nthe 'enumerated articles' none were produced in New England; while salt\r\nfor fisheries, and wine from Madeira and the Azores, branches of foreign\r\ntrade in which New England was deeply interested, were specially\r\nexempted from the operation of an Act which had chiefly in view the more\r\nsouthern colonies.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol I.,\r\nChap xiv.' p. 473.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xviii., pp.\r\n461, 462.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: The following is a specimen of the manner in which they\r\ninterpreted their Charter to extend their territory. Having interpreted\r\ntheir Charter to exempt themselves from all responsibility to the Crown\r\nfor their legislation or acts, they devised a new interpretation of\r\ntheir Charter in order to extend their territory to the north and\r\nnorth-east. The Charter limited their territories to three miles of the\r\nnorth bank of the Merrimac. At the end of twenty years they decided that\r\nthe Charter meant three miles north of the most northern land or elbow\r\nof the Merrimac, and then not follow within three miles of the north\r\nbank of the river to its mouth, but a straight line east and west, which\r\nwould give to their Plantation, Maine and a large part of New Hampshire,\r\nto the exclusion of the original patentees. When the Royal\r\nCommissioners, as directed by the King, came to investigate the\r\ncomplaints on this disputed boundary of territory, they decided against\r\nthe pretensions of the Massachusetts Bay rulers, and appointed\r\nmagistrates, etc., to give effect to their decision; but the authorities\r\nof Massachusetts Bay, acknowledging no superior under heaven, resumed\r\ncontrol of the territory in dispute as soon as the Commissioners had\r\nleft the country. Mr. Hildreth says:\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after the departure of the Royal Commissioners, Leverett, now\r\nMajor-General of the Colony, was sent to Maine, with three other\r\nmagistrates and a body of horse, to re-establish the authority of\r\nMassachusetts. In spite of the remonstrances of Col. Nichols at New York\r\n(the head of the Royal Commission), the new Government lately set up was\r\nobliged to yield. Several persons were punished for speaking\r\nirreverently of the re-established authority of Massachusetts.\"\r\n(Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap. xiv., pp. 473,\r\n474.) For eleven years the Massachusetts Bay Government maintained this\r\nascendency against all complaints and appeals to England, when in 1677,\r\nas Mr. Hildreth says, \"After hearing the parties, the Privy Council\r\ndecided, in accordance with the opinion of the two Chief Justices, that\r\nthe Massachusetts patent did not give any territory more than three\r\nmiles distant from the left or north bank of the Merrimac. This\r\nconstruction, which set aside the pretensions of Massachusetts to the\r\nprovince of Maine, as well as to that part of New Hampshire east of the\r\nMerrimac, appeared so plain to English lawyers that the agents (of\r\nMassachusetts) hardly attempted a word in defence.\" (History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. II., Chap. xviii., pp. 496, 497.)\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that as early as the second year of the civil war in\r\nEngland, the Massachusetts Bay Court passed an Act, in 1643, declaring\r\nit a capital crime for any one in their jurisdiction to advocate or\r\nsupport the cause of the King; some years afterwards they passed an Act\r\nforbidding all trade with the other American colonies who would not\r\nrenounce their allegiance to the King; in their addresses to the\r\nParliament and Cromwell, in 1651 and 1654, as shown above, they claimed,\r\nas a ground of merit for peculiar favour, that they had done their\r\nutmost, by devotional and material aid of men and means, in support of\r\nthe Parliamentary, and afterwards regicide party, from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the war--so that loyalists as well as churchmen were treated\r\nby them as outcasts and aliens--and now, after having begged, in\r\nlanguage of sycophantic subserviency, the Royal pardon for the past, and\r\nobtained it on certain conditions, they claim the boon but refuse to\r\nfulfil the conditions, making all sorts of excuses, promises, and\r\nevasions for twenty years--professing and promising one thing in London,\r\ndoing the opposite in Massachusetts, protracting where they dare not\r\nresist, but practically doing to the vacating of the Charter what Mr.\r\nBancroft states in the pregnant sentences above quoted in the text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF CHARLES THE SECOND AND JAMES\r\nTHE SECOND, FROM 1680 TO 1688--THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES AND MANNER OF\r\nCANCELLING THE FIRST CHARTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crisis was now approaching. The state of things shown in the latter\r\npart of the preceding chapter could not be suffered always to continue.\r\nMeans must be devised to bring it to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Court had sent successive agents to England to explain\r\nand to make promises concerning many things complained of, to crave\r\nindulgence and delay in other things which they could not explain or\r\njustify; but they prohibited their agents, by private instructions, from\r\nconceding anything which the Charter, as they interpreted it, had given\r\nthem--namely, absolute independence. But this double game was nearly\r\nplayed out. Party struggles in England had absorbed the attention of the\r\nKing and Cabinet, and caused a public and vacillating policy to be\r\npursued in regard to Massachusetts; but the King's Government were at\r\nlength roused to decisive action, and threatened the colony with a writ\r\nof _quo warranto_ in respect to matters so often demanded and as often\r\nevaded.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Court met forthwith, passed an Act to control the\r\ncommission of the King's Collector, Edward Randolph, and another Act\r\ncharging their own newly-appointed Collector to look strictly after the\r\nenforcement of the Acts of Trade (but in reality to counteract them);\r\nrepealed another Act which imposed a penalty for plotting the overthrow\r\nof the Colonial Constitution--an Act levelled against Randolph; passed\r\nanother Act substituting the word \"Jurisdiction\" for the word\r\n\"Commonwealth\" in their laws. They authorized their agents merely to\r\nlay these concessions before the King, and humbly hoped they would\r\nsatisfy his Majesty. They also bribed clerks of the Privy Council to\r\nkeep them informed of its proceedings on Massachusetts affairs, and\r\noffered a bribe of £2,000 to King Charles himself. Mr. Hildreth says\r\n(1683): \"On the appearance of these agents at Court, with powers so\r\nrestricted, a _quo warranto_ was threatened forthwith unless they were\r\nfurnished with ampler authority. Informed of this threat, the General\r\nCourt (of Massachusetts), after great debates, authorized their agents\r\nto consent to the regulation of anything wherein the Government might\r\n_ignorantly_, or _through mistake_, have deviated from the Charter; to\r\naccept, indeed, any demands consistent with the Charter (as they\r\ninterpreted it), the existing Government established under it, and the\r\n'main ends of our predecessors in coming hither,' which main ends were\r\ndefined by them to be 'our liberties and privileges in matters of\r\nreligion and worship of God, which you are, therefore, in no wise to\r\nconsent to any infringement of.' They were authorized to give up Maine\r\nto the King, and even to tender him a private gratuity of two thousand\r\nguineas. Bribes were quite fashionable at Charles's Court; the King and\r\nhis servants were accustomed to take them. The Massachusetts agents[180]\r\nhad expended considerable sums to purchase a favour, or to obtain\r\ninformation, and by having clerks of the Privy Council in their pay they\r\nwere kept well informed of the secret deliberations of that body. But\r\nthis offer (of a bribe of two thousand guineas to the King), unskilfully\r\nmanaged, and betrayed by Cranfield, the lately appointed Royal Governor\r\nof New Hampshire, who had advised the magistrates to make it, exposed\r\nthe Colony to blame and ridicule.\"[181]\r\n\r\n\"If a liberty of appeal to England were insisted on, the agents were\r\n'not to include the colony in any act or consent of theirs, but to crave\r\nleave to transmit the same to the General Court for their further\r\nconsideration.' They were 'not to make any alteration of the\r\nqualifications that were required by law, as at present established,\r\nrespecting the _admission of freemen_.'\"[182]\r\n\r\nIt having appeared, on the perusal of the commission of the\r\nMassachusetts agents by Sir Lionel Jenkins, Secretary of State, that\r\nthey did not possess the powers required to enable them to act, they\r\nwere informed by Lord Radnor that \"the Council had unanimously agreed to\r\nreport to his Majesty, that unless the agents speedily obtained such\r\npowers as might render them capable to satisfy in all points, a _quo\r\nwarranto_ should proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon receipt of these advices,\" says Mr. Hutchinson, \"it was made a\r\nquestion, not in the General Court only, but amongst all the\r\ninhabitants, whether to surrender or not. The opinions of many of the\r\nministers, and their arguments in support of them, were given in\r\nwriting, and in general it was thought better to die by the hands of\r\nothers than by their own.[183] The address was agreed upon by the\r\nGeneral Court; another was prepared and sent through the colony, to be\r\nsigned by the several inhabitants, which the agents were to present or\r\nnot, as they thought proper; and they were (privately) to deliver up the\r\ndeeds of the Province of Maine, if required, and it would tend to\r\npreserve their Charter, otherwise not; and they were to make no\r\nconcessions of any privileges conferred on the colony by the\r\nCharter.\"[184] (That is, according to their interpretation and\r\npretensions.)\r\n\r\n\"Governor Bradstreet and the moderate party were inclined to authorise\r\nthe agents to receive the King's commands. The magistrates passed a vote\r\nto that effect. But all the zeal and obstinacy of the theocratic party\r\nhad been roused by the present crisis--a zeal resulting, as hot zeal\r\noften does, in the ultimate loss of what it was so anxious to\r\nsave.\"[185]\r\n\r\nThe agents of the colony were not willing to undertake the defence and\r\nmanagement of the question upon the Charter in Westminster Hall. The\r\nwrit of _quo warranto_, which summoned the Corporation of Massachusetts\r\nBay to defend their acts against the complaints and charges made against\r\nthem, was issued the 27th of June, 1683, and on the 20th of July \"It was\r\nordered by the Privy Council, 'that Mr. Edward Randolph be sent to New\r\nEngland with the notification of the said _quo warranto_, which he was\r\nto deliver to the said Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay,\r\nand thereupon to return to give his Majesty an account of his\r\nproceedings therein.'\"[186] This writ was accompanied by a declaration\r\nfrom the King \"that the private interests and properties of all persons\r\nwithin the colony should be continued and preserved to them, so that no\r\nman should receive any prejudice in his freehold or estate;\" also, \"that\r\nin case the said Corporation of the Massachusetts Bay should, before the\r\nprosecution had upon the said _quo warranto_, make a full submission and\r\nentire resignation to his pleasure, he would then regulate their Charter\r\n(as stated in another place, by adding supplementary clauses) in such a\r\nmanner as should be for his service and the good of the colony, without\r\nany other alterations than such as he should find necessary for the\r\nbetter support of his Government.\"[187]\r\n\r\nOn the issue of the writ of _quo warranto_, the business of the colony's\r\nagents in London was at an end. They returned home, and arrived in\r\nBoston the 23rd of October, 1683; and the same week Randolph arrived\r\nwith the _quo warranto_ and the King's accompanying declaration. The\r\nannouncement of this decisive act on the part of the King produced a\r\nprofound sensation throughout the colony, and gave rise to the question,\r\n\"What shall Massachusetts do?\" One part of the colony advocated\r\n_submission_; another party advocated _resistance_. The former were\r\ncalled the \"Moderate party,\" the latter the \"Patriot party\"--the\r\ncommencement of the two parties which were afterwards known as United\r\nEmpire Loyalists and Revolutionists.[188] The Moderate party was led by\r\nthe memorable Governor Bradstreet, Stoughton, and Dudley, and included a\r\nmajority of the assistants or magistrates, called the \"Upper branch of\r\nthe Government.\" The Independence party was headed by the Deputy\r\nGovernor Danforth, Gookin, and Nowell, and included a majority of the\r\nHouse of Deputies, over whose elections and proceedings the elders or\r\nministers exerted a potent influence.[189]\r\n\r\nGovernor Bradstreet and a majority of the assistants, or magistrates,\r\nadopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"The magistrates have voted that an humble address be sent to his\r\nMajesty by this ship, declaring that, upon a serious consideration of\r\nhis Majesty's gracious intimations in his former letters, and more\r\nparticularly in his late declaration, that his pleasure and purpose is\r\nonly to regulate our Charter in such a manner as shall be for his\r\nservice and the good of this his colony, and without any other\r\nalteration than what is necessary for the support of his Government\r\nhere, we will not presume to contend with his Majesty in a Court of law,\r\nbut humbly lay ourselves at his Majesty's feet, in submission to his\r\npleasure so declared, and that we have resolved by the next opportunity\r\nto send our agents empowered to receive his Majesty's commands\r\naccordingly. And, for saving a default for non-appearance upon the\r\nreturn of the writ of _quo warranto_, that some person or persons be\r\nappointed and empowered, by letter of attorney, to appear and make\r\ndefence until our agents may make their appearance and submission as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\"The magistrates have passed this without reference to the consent of\r\ntheir brethren the deputies hereto.\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"EDMUND RAWSON, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\"15th November, 1683.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was laid before the House of Deputies and debated by\r\nthem a fortnight, when the majority of them adopted the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n\"November 30, 1683.--The deputies consent not, but adhere to their\r\nformer bills.\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM TERRY, _Clerk_.\"[190]\r\n\r\n\"They voted instead,\" says Mr. Hildreth, \"an Address to the King,\r\npraying forbearance; but they authorized Robert Humphreys, a London\r\nbarrister and the legal adviser of the agents, to enter an appearance\r\nand to retain counsel, requesting him 'to leave no stone unturned that\r\nmay be of service either to the case itself, or the spinning out of the\r\ntime as much as possibly may be.' No less than three letters were\r\nwritten to Humphreys; money was remitted; but all hopes of defence were\r\nfutile. Before the letters arrived in London, a default had already been\r\nrecorded. That default could not be got off, and judgment was entered\r\nthe next year pronouncing the Charter void.\"[191]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the questions at issue were put to a popular vote\r\nin Massachusetts was unfair and misleading; the epithets applied to the\r\n\"Moderate\" or loyal party were offensive and unjust; and the statements\r\nof Palfrey, respecting the acts of the King immediately following the\r\nvacation of the Charter, are very disingenuous, not to say untrue.\r\n\r\nThe King had expressly and repeatedly declared that he would not proceed\r\nto vacate the Charter if they would submit to his decision on the six\r\ngrounds mentioned in his first letter to them, June 28, 1662, twenty\r\nyears before, as the conditions of continuing the Charter, and which\r\nthey had persistently evaded and resisted; that his decision should be\r\nin the form of certain \"Regulations\" for the future administration of\r\nthe Charter, and not the vacation of it. Every reader knows the\r\ndifference between a Royal Charter of incorporation and the Royal\r\ninstructions issued twenty years afterwards to remedy irregularities and\r\nabuses which had been shown to have crept in, and practised in the local\r\nadministration of the Charter. Yet the ruling party in Massachusetts Bay\r\ndid not put the question as accepting the King's offers, but as of\r\nvacating the Charter. This was raising a false issue, and an avowed\r\nimputation and contempt of the King. It is true that Dr. Palfrey and\r\nother modern New England historians have said that Charles the Second\r\nhad from the beginning intended to abolish the Charter; that the\r\n\"vacation of the Charter was a foregone conclusion.\" In reply to which\r\nit may be said that this is mere assumption, unsupported by facts; that\r\nif Charles the Second had wished or intended to vacate the Charter, he\r\nhad the amplest opportunity and reasons to do so, in the zenith of his\r\npopularity and power, when they refused to comply with the conditions on\r\nwhich he proposed to pardon and obliterate the past and continue the\r\nCharter, and when they resisted his Commissioners, and employed military\r\nforce to oppose the exercise of their powers, and set aside their\r\ndecisions; instead of which he remonstrated with them for more than\r\ntwenty years, and then gave them long notice and choice to retain the\r\nCharter with his \"Regulations\" on the disputed points, or contest the\r\nCharter, as to their observance of it, in a Court of law. Under the\r\nimpulse and guidance of violent counsels they chose the latter, and lost\r\ntheir Charter. In their very last address to the King, they gratefully\r\nacknowledged his kindness in all his despatches and treatment of them,\r\ncontrary to the statements and imputations of modern New England\r\nhistorians; yet they denied him the authority universally acknowledged\r\nand exercised by Queen Victoria and English Courts of law over the\r\nlegislative, judicial, and even administrative acts of every province of\r\nthe British Empire. Dr. Palfrey says: \"In the Upper branch of the\r\nGovernment there was found at length a _servile_ majority;\" but \"the\r\ndeputies were prepared for no such _suicide_, though there were not\r\nwanting faint hearts and grovelling aims among them.\"[192] At the head\r\nof what Dr. Palfrey terms the \"servile majority\" was the venerable\r\nGovernor Bradstreet, now more than ninety years of age, the only\r\nsurvivor of the original founders of the colony, who had been a\r\nmagistrate more than fifty years, more than once Governor, always a\r\nfaithful and safe counsellor, the agent of the colony in England, and\r\nobtaining in June, 1662, the King's letter of pardon--oblivion of the\r\npast and promised continuance of the Charter on certain conditions--a\r\nletter which the Colonial Court said filled them with inexpressible joy\r\nand gratitude (see above, page 141), who then advised them to comply\r\nwith the King's requirements, and who, after twenty years' further\r\nexperience and knowledge of public affairs and parties, advises them to\r\npursue the same course for which he is now termed \"servile,\" and ranked\r\nwith cowards and men of \"grovelling aims,\" advising the colony to commit\r\npolitical \"suicide.\" The result showed who were the real authors of the\r\n\"suicide,\" and Dr. Palfrey forcibly states the result of their doings in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\"Massachusetts, as a body politic, was now no more. The elaborate\r\nfabric, that had been fifty-four years in building, was levelled to the\r\ndust. The hopes of the fathers were found to be mere dreams. It seemed\r\nthat their brave struggles had brought no result. The honoured ally\r\n(Massachusetts) of the Protector (Cromwell) of England lay under the\r\nfeet of Charles the Second. It was on the Charter granted to Roswell and\r\nhis associates, Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay, that the\r\nstructure of the cherished institutions of Massachusetts, religious and\r\ncivil, had been reared. The abrogation of that Charter swept the whole\r\naway. Massachusetts, in English law, was again what it had been before\r\nJames the First made a grant of it to the Council of New England. It\r\nbelonged to the King of England, by virtue of the discovery of the\r\nCabots. No less than this was the import of the decree in Westminster\r\nHall. Having secured its great triumph, the Court had no thought of\r\nlosing anything by the weakness of compassion. The person selected by\r\nthe King to govern the people of his newly-acquired province was Colonel\r\nPiercy Kirk. That campaign in the West of England had not yet taken\r\nplace which has made the name of Kirk immortal; but fame enough had gone\r\nabroad of his brutal character, to make his advent an anticipation of\r\nhorror to those whom he was appointed to govern. It was settled that he\r\nwas to be called 'His Majesty's Lieutenant and Governor-General,' and\r\nthat his authority should be unrestricted.\"[193]\r\n\r\nThis quotation from Dr. Palfrey suggests one or two remarks, and\r\nrequires correction, as it is as disingenuous in statement as it is\r\neloquent in diction. He admits and assumes the validity of the judicial\r\nact by which the Charter was declared forfeited; though the loyalty of\r\nthis decision was denied by the opposing party in Massachusetts, who\r\ndenied that any English Court, or that even the King himself, had any\r\nauthority in Massachusetts to disallow any of its acts or decisions,\r\nmuch less to vacate its Charter, and professed to continue its elections\r\nof deputies, etc., and to pass and administer laws as aforetime. Dr.\r\nPalfrey's language presents all such pretensions and proceedings as\r\nbaseless and puerile.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey states what is true, that the Massachusetts Government had\r\nbeen the \"ally\" of Cromwell; but this they had denied in their addresses\r\nto Charles the Second. (See above, pp. 153-9.)\r\n\r\nIt is hardly ingenuous or correct in Dr. Palfrey speaking of Col. Kirk's\r\nappointment of the \"newly-acquired Province.\" The office extended over\r\nNew Hampshire, Maine, and Plymouth as well as Massachusetts; but Kirk\r\nnever was Governor of Massachusetts, for before his commission and\r\ninstructions were completed, all was annulled by the demise of King\r\nCharles, which took place the 6th of February, 1685. Mr. Hutchinson\r\nsays: \"Before any new Government was settled, King Charles died. Mr.\r\nBlaithwait wrote to the Governor and recommended the proclaiming of King\r\nJames without delay. This was done with great ceremony in the high\r\nstreet of Boston (April 20th).\"[194]\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Dudley, a native of the colony, and one of the two last\r\nagents sent to England, was appointed the first Governor after the\r\nannulling of the Charter. Mr. Hutchinson says: \"The 15th of May (1686),\r\nthe _Rose_ frigate arrived from England, with a commission to Mr. Dudley\r\nas President, and divers others, gentlemen of the Council, to take upon\r\nthem the administration of government.\" Mr. Dudley's short\r\nadministration was not very grievous. The House of Deputies, indeed, was\r\nlaid aside; but the people, the time being short, felt little or no\r\neffect from the change. Mr. Stoughton was Mr. Dudley's chief confidant.\r\nMr. Dudley professed as great an attachment to the interest of the\r\ncolony as Mr. Stoughton, and was very desirous of retaining their\r\nfavour. A letter from Mr. Mather, then the minister of the greatest\r\ninfluence, is a proof of it.[195] There was no molestation to the\r\nChurches of the colony, but they continued both worship and discipline\r\nas before. The affairs of the towns were likewise managed in the same\r\nmanner as formerly. Their Courts of justice were continued upon the\r\nformer plan, Mr. Stoughton being at the head of them. Trials were by\r\njuries, as usual. Dudley considered himself as appointed to preserve the\r\naffairs of the colony from confusion until a Governor arrived and a\r\nrule of administration should be more fully settled.[196]\r\n\r\nThe administration of Dudley was only of seven months' duration. Dudley\r\nwas superseded by Sir Edmund Andros, who arrived at Boston on the 20th\r\nof December (1686), with a commission from King James for the government\r\nof New England.[197] He was instructed to appoint no one of the Council\r\nto any offices but those of the least estates and characters, and to\r\ndisplace none without sufficient cause; to continue the former laws of\r\nthe country, as far as they were not inconsistent with his commission or\r\ninstructions, until other regulations were established by the Governor\r\nand Council; to allow no printing press; to give universal toleration in\r\nreligion, but encouragement to the Church of England; to execute the\r\nlaws of trade, and prevent frauds in Customs.[198] But Andros had other\r\ninstructions of a more despotic and stringent character; and being, like\r\nKing James himself, of an arbitrary disposition, he fulfilled his\r\ninstructions to the letter. And when his Royal master was dethroned for\r\nhis unconstitutional and tyrannical conduct, Andros was seized at Boston\r\nand sent prisoner to England, to answer for his conduct; but he was\r\nacquitted by the new Government, not for his policy in New England, but\r\nbecause he had acted according to his instructions, which he pleaded as\r\nhis justification.[199]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that _toleration_ in Massachusetts should have been\r\nproclaimed by the arbitrary James, in a declaration above and contrary\r\nto the law for which he received the thanks of the ministers in that\r\ncolony, but which resulted in his loss of his Crown in England.\r\n\r\n\"James's Declaration of Indulgence was proclaimed (1687), and now, for\r\nthe first time, Quakers, Baptists, and Episcopalians enjoyed toleration\r\nin Massachusetts. That system of religious tyranny, coeval with the\r\nsettlement of New England, thus unexpectedly received its death-blow\r\nfrom a Catholic bigot, who professed a willingness to allow religious\r\nfreedom to others as a means of securing it for himself.\" ... \"Mather,\r\nwho carried with him (1689) an address from the ministers, thanking\r\nJames, in behalf of themselves and their brethren, for his Declaration\r\nof Indulgence arriving in England while King James was yet in power, had\r\nbeen graciously received by that monarch. But, though repeatedly\r\nadmitted to an audience, his complaints against the Royal Governor\r\n(Andros) had produced no effect. The Revolution intervening, he\r\nhastened, with greater hopes of success, to address himself to the new\r\nKing, and his remonstrances prevented, as far as Massachusetts was\r\nconcerned, the despatch of a circular letter confirming the authority of\r\nall Colonial officers holding commissions from James II. The letters\r\nactually received at Boston authorized those in authority to retain\r\nprovisionally the administration, and directed that Andros and the other\r\nprisoners should be sent to England.\"[200]\r\n\r\nI have now traced the proceedings of the founders and rulers of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay Colony during the fifty-four years of their first\r\nCharter, with short notices of some occurrences during the three years'\r\nreign of James the Second, their revenge not only in his own\r\ndethronement, but also on his Governor Andros, for the tyranny which he\r\npractised upon them by imprisoning him and his helpers, and by Royal\r\ncommand sending them as prisoners to England, together with the removal\r\nof the local officers appointed by Andros and the restoration of their\r\nown elected authorities until further instruction from the new King.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the founders of that colony were not only\r\nmen of wealth, but men of education, of piety, of the highest\r\nrespectability, of great energy, enterprize, and industry, contributing\r\nto the rapid progress of their settlements and increase of their wealth,\r\nand stamping the character of their history; but after their emigration\r\nto Massachusetts Bay, and during the progress of their settlements and\r\nthe organization and development of their undertakings, their views\r\nbecame narrowed to the dimensions of their own Plantation in government\r\nand trade, irrespective of the interests of England, or of the other\r\nneighbour colonies, and their theology and religious spirit was of the\r\nnarrowest and most intolerant character. They assumed to be the chosen\r\nIsrael of God, subject to no King but Jehovah, above the rulers of the\r\nland, planted there to cast out the heathen, to smite down every dagon\r\nof false worship, whether Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Baptist, or\r\nQuaker, and responsible to no other power on earth for either their\r\nlegislative or administrative acts. I will not here recapitulate those\r\nacts, so fully stated in preceding pages, and established by evidence of\r\ndocuments and testimony which cannot be successfully denied. But there\r\nare two features of their pretensions and government which demand\r\nfurther remark.\r\n\r\nI. The first is the character and narrowness of the foundation on which\r\nrested their legislation and government. None but members of the\r\nCongregational Churches were eligible to legislate or fill any office in\r\nthe colony, or even to be an elector. A more narrow-minded and\r\ncorrupting test of qualification for civil or political office, or for\r\nthe elective franchise, can hardly be conceived.[201] However rich a man\r\nmight be, and whatever might be his education or social position, if he\r\nwere not a member of the Congregational Church he was an \"alien in the\r\nCommonwealth\" of the Massachusetts Israel, was ineligible for office, or\r\nto be an elector; while his own servant, if a member of the Church,\r\nthough not worth a shilling, or paying a penny to the public revenue,\r\nwas an elector, or eligible to be elected to any public office. The\r\nnon-members of the Congregational Church were subject to all military\r\nand civil burdens and taxes of the State, without any voice in its\r\nlegislation or administration. Such was the free (?) Government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, eulogized by New England historians during half a\r\ncentury, until abolished by judicial and royal authority. What would be\r\nthought at this day of a Government, the eligibility to public office\r\nand the elective franchise under which should be based on membership in\r\na particular Church?\r\n\r\nII. But, secondly, this Government must be regarded as equally unjust\r\nand odious when we consider not merely the sectarian basis of its\r\nassumptions and acts against the Sovereign on the one hand, and the\r\nrights of citizens of Massachusetts and of neighbouring colonies on the\r\nother, but the small proportion of the population enfranchised in\r\ncomparison with the population which was disfranchised. Even at the\r\nbeginning it was not professed that the proportion of Congregational\r\nChurch members to the whole population was more than one to three; in\r\nafter years it was alleged, at most, not to have been more than one to\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is of little importance in comparison with the question,\r\nwhat was the proportion of electors to non-electors in the colony? On\r\nthis point I take as my authority the latest and most able apologist\r\nand defender of the Massachusetts Government, Dr. Palfrey. He says:\r\n\"Counting the lists of persons admitted to the franchise in\r\nMassachusetts, and making what I judge to be reasonable allowance for\r\npersons deceased, I come to the conclusion that the number of freemen in\r\nMassachusetts in 1670 may have been between 1,000 and 1,200, or one\r\nfreeman to every four or five adult males.\"[202]\r\n\r\nThe whole population of the colony at this time is not definitely\r\nstated, but there was one elector to every \"four or five\" of the adult\r\n\"_males_.\" This eleven hundred men, because they were Congregationalists,\r\ninfluenced and controlled by their ministers, elected from themselves all\r\nthe legislators and rulers of Massachusetts Bay Colony in civil, judicial,\r\nand military matters, who bearded the King and Parliament, persecuted all\r\nwho dissented from them in religious worship, encroached upon the property\r\nand rights of neighbouring colonies, levied and imposed all the burdens\r\nof the State upon four-fifths of their fellow (male) colonists who had\r\nno voice in the legislation or administration of the Government. Yet\r\nthis sectarian Government is called by New England historians a free\r\nGovernment; and these eleven hundred electors--electors not because\r\nthey have property, but because they are Congregationalists--are called\r\n\"the people of Massachusetts,\" while four-fifths of the male population\r\nand more than four-fifths of the property are utterly ignored, except\r\nto pay the taxes or bear the other burdens of the State, but without\r\na single elective voice, or a single free press to state their grievances\r\nor express their wishes, much less to advocate their rights and those of\r\nthe King and Parliament.\r\n\r\nIII. Thirdly, from the facts and authorities given in the foregoing\r\npages, there cannot be a reasonable pretext for the statement that the\r\nrulers of Massachusetts Bay had not violated both the objects and\r\nprovisions of the Royal Charter, variously and persistently, during the\r\nfifty-four years of its existence; while there is not an instance of\r\neither Charles the First or Second claiming a single prerogative\r\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Charter, and which is not freely\r\nrecognized at this day in the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain, by\r\nthe free inhabitants of every Province of the British Empire. The fact\r\nthat neither of the Charleses asked for anything more than the\r\ntoleration of Episcopal worship, never objected to the perfect freedom\r\nof worship claimed by the Congregationalists of Massachusetts; and the\r\nfact that Charles the Second corresponded and remonstrated for twenty\r\nyears and more to induce the rulers of Massachusetts Bay to acknowledge\r\nthose rights of King and Parliament, and their duties as British\r\nsubjects, shows that there could have been no desire to interfere with\r\ntheir freedom of worship or to abolish the Charter, except as a last\r\nresort, after the failure of all other means to restrain the disloyal\r\nand oppressive acts of the rulers of that one colony. In\r\ncontradistinction to the practice of other colonies of New England, and\r\nof every British colony at this day, Charles the First and Second were\r\nbad kings to England and Scotland, but were otherwise to New England;\r\nand when New England historians narrate at great length, and paint in\r\nthe darkest colours, the persecutions and despotic acts of the Stuart\r\nkings over England and Scotland, and then infer that they did or sought\r\nto do the same in New England, they make groundless assumptions,\r\ncontrary to the express declarations and policy of the two Charleses and\r\nthe whole character and tenor of New England history. The demands of\r\nCharles the Second, and the conditions on which he proposed to continue\r\nthe first Charter in 1662, were every one sanctioned and provided for in\r\nthe second Royal Charter issued by William and Mary in 1690, and under\r\nwhich, for seventy years, the Government was milder and more liberal,\r\nthe legislation broader, the social state more happy, and the colony\r\nmore loyal and prosperous than it had ever been during the fifty-four\r\nyears of the first Charter. All this will be proved and illustrated in\r\nthe following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: The Massachusetts Court had applied to Cromwell for\r\npermission to use the word \"Commonwealth\" instead of the word\r\n\"Plantation,\" as expressed in their Charter, but were refused. They\r\nafterwards adopted it of their own accord.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap.\r\nxiv., pp. 500, 506.\r\n\r\nTheir attempt to bribe the King was not the less bribery, whether\r\nCranfield, for his own amusement, or otherwise to test their virtue,\r\nsuggested it to them or not. But without any suggestion from Cranfield\r\nthey bribed the King's clerks from their fidelity in the Privy Council,\r\nand bribed others \"to obtain favour.\" The whole tenor of Scripture\r\ninjunction and morality is against offering as well as taking bribes.\r\nAfter authorizing the employment of _bribery_ in England to promote\r\ntheir objects, the Court closed their sittings by appointing \"a day for\r\nsolemn humiliation throughout the colony, to implore the mercy and\r\nfavour of God in respect to their sacred, civil, and temporal concerns,\r\nand more especially those in the hands of their agents abroad.\"\r\n(Palfrey, Vol. III., B. iii, Chap. ix., pp. 374, 375.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. III., B. iii.,\r\nChap. ix., pp. 372, 373.\r\n\r\n\"The agents of the colony, Messrs.

At that time they had not been heard before the Council; but\r\nsoon after, on presenting the address which had been forwarded by their\r\nhands, they were commanded to show their powers and instructions to Sir\r\nLionel Jenkins, Secretary of State; and on their perusal, finding these\r\npowers wholly inadequate, they were informed by Lord Radnor that the\r\nCouncil had agreed _nem. con._ to report to his Majesty, that unless\r\nfurther powers were speedily obtained, a _quo warranto_ should proceed\r\nin Hilary Term.\" (Barry's History of Massachusetts, First Period, Chap.\r\nxvii, p. 471.

They oppose the Acts of Navigation, and imprison the King's\r\nofficers for doing their duty. 7. They have established a Naval Office,\r\nwith a view to defraud the customs. 8. No verdicts are ever found for\r\nthe King in relation to customs, and the Courts impose costs on the\r\nprosecutors, in order to discourage trials. 9. They levy customs on the\r\nimportation of goods from England. 10. They do not administer the oath\r\nof supremacy, as required by the Charter. 11. They erected a Court of\r\nAdmiralty, though not empowered by Charter. 12. They discountenance the\r\nChurch of England. 13. They persist in coining money, though they had\r\nasked forgiveness for that offence.\" (Chalmers' Annals, p. 462.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: _Ib._, p. 377.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: \"From this period (1683) one may date the origin of two\r\nparties--the Patriots and Prerogative men--between whom controversy\r\nscarcely intermitted, and was never ended until the separation of the\r\ntwo countries.\" (Minot's History of Massachusetts, etc., Vol. I., p.\r\n51.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: In a Boston town meeting, held January 21, 1684, to\r\nconsider the King's declaration, the Rev. Increase Mather, who was then\r\nPresident of Harvard College, and had for twenty years exerted more\r\ninfluence upon the public affairs of Massachusetts than any other man\r\nfor the same length of time, delivered a speech against submission to\r\nthe King, which he miscalled \"the surrender of the Charter.\" He said,\r\namong other things: \"I verily believe we shall sin against the God of\r\nheaven if we vote in the affirmative to it. The Scripture teacheth us\r\notherwise. That which the Lord our God hath given us, shall we not\r\npossess it? God forbid that we should give away the inheritance of our\r\nfathers. Nor would it be wisdom for us to comply. If we make a full and\r\nentire resignation to the King's pleasure, we fall into the hands of men\r\nimmediately; but if we do not, we still keep ourselves in the hands of\r\nGod; and who knows what God may do for us?\" The historian says that \"the\r\neffect of such an appeal was wholly irresistible; that many of the\r\npeople fell into tears, and there was a general acclamation.\" (Barry's\r\nColonial History of Massachusetts, Vol. I., pp. 476, 477.)\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to squeeze as much extravagance and nonsense in the same\r\nspace as in the above quoted words of Increase Mather. Where was the\r\nScripture which taught them not to submit complaints of their\r\nfellow-colonists to their King and his Council, the highest authority in\r\nthe empire? Both Scripture and profane history furnish us with examples\r\nalmost without number of usurpers professing that the usurpation and\r\nconquest they had achieved was \"that which the Lord our God had given\"\r\nthem, and which they should \"possess\" at all hazards as if it were an\r\n\"inheritance of their fathers.\" The \"inheritance\" spoken of by Mr.\r\nMather was what had been usurped by the rulers of the colony over and\r\nabove the provisions of their Charter against the rights of the Crown,\r\nthe religious and political liberties of their fellow-colonists, and\r\nencroaching upon the lands of their white and Indian neighbours. Then to\r\nsubmit to the King and Council was to \"fall into the hands of men\r\nimmediately,\" but to contest with the King in the Courts of Chancery or\r\nKing's Bench was to \"keep themselves in the hands of God,\" who, it\r\nseems, according to Increase Mather's own interpretation, judged him and\r\nhis adherents unworthy of retaining the \"inheritance\" of the Charter,\r\nthe powers and objects of which they had so greatly perverted and\r\nabused. The King had expressly declared that the prosecution against the\r\nCharter would be abandoned if they would submit to his decision in\r\nregard to what had been matters of complaint and dispute between them\r\nand their fellow-colonists and Sovereign for more than fifty years, and\r\nwhich decision should be added to the Charter as explanatory\r\nregulations, and should embrace nothing affecting their religious\r\nliberties or local elective self-government. They refused, and lost\r\ntheir Charter; Rhode Island and Connecticut submitted, and even resigned\r\ntheir Charters, and were afterwards authorized to resume them, with the\r\nprivileges and powers conferred by them unimpaired, including the\r\nelection of their Governors as well as legislators, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp.\r\n338, 339.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap.\r\nxiv., p. 507.

Under the Charter by William and Mary,\r\nin 1691, the qualification of electors was then fixed at a 'freehold of\r\nforty shillings per annum, or other property of the value of £40\r\nsterling.'\" (Elliott's New England History, Vol. I., p. 113.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. III., B. iii.,\r\nChap. ii., p. 41, in a note.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ROYAL CHARTER; HOW OBTAINED--MASSACHUSETTS NEARLY SIXTY YEARS\r\nUNDER THE SECOND CHARTER, FROM 1691 TO 1748; TO THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST\r\nWAR BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE, AND THE PEACE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have traced the characteristics of the Government of the Massachusetts\r\nBay Colony during fifty-four years under its first Charter, in its\r\nrelations to the Crown, to the citizens of its own jurisdiction, to the\r\ninhabitants of the neighbouring colonies, and to the Indians; its denial\r\nof Royal authority; its renunciation of one form of worship and Church\r\npolity, and adoption of another; its denial of toleration to any but\r\nCongregationalists, and of the elective franchise, to four-fifths of the\r\nmale population; its taxing without representation; its denial of the\r\nright of appeal to the King, or any right on the part of the King or\r\nParliament to receive appeals, or to the exercise of any supervision or\r\nmeans of seeing that \"the laws of England were not contravened\" by their\r\nacts of legislation or government, while they were sheltered by the\r\nBritish navy from the actual and threatened invasion of the Dutch,\r\nSpaniards, and French, not to say the Indians, always prompted and\r\nbacked by the French, thus claiming all the attributes of an independent\r\nGovernment, but resting under the ægis of an Imperial protection to\r\nmaintain an independence which they asserted, but could not themselves\r\nmaintain against foreign enemies.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to note the subsequent corresponding facts of their\r\nhistory during seventy years under the second Royal Charter.\r\n\r\nThey averred, and no doubt brought themselves to believe, that with\r\ntheir first Charter, as interpreted by themselves, was bound up their\r\n_political life_, or what they alleged to be dearer to them than life,\r\nand that in its loss was involved their _political death_; but they made\r\nno martial effort to prolong that life, or to save themselves from that\r\npremature death.\r\n\r\nMr. Palfrey assigns various reasons for this non-resistance to the\r\ncancelling of their Charter; but he omits or obscurely alludes to the\r\nreal ones.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey says: \"The reader asks how it could be that the decree by\r\nwhich Massachusetts fell should fail to provoke resistance. He inquires\r\nwhether nothing was left of the spirit which, when the colony was much\r\npoorer, had often defied and baffled the designs of the father of the\r\nreigning King. He must remember how times were changed. There was no\r\nlonger a great patriot party in England, to which the colonists might\r\nlook for sympathy and help, and which it had even hoped might reinforce\r\nthem by a new emigration. There was no longer even a Presbyterian party\r\nwhich, little as it had loved them, a sense of common insecurity and\r\ncommon interest might enlist in their behalf.... Relatively to her\r\npopulation and wealth, Massachusetts had large capacities for becoming a\r\nnaval power--capacities which might have been vigorously developed if an\r\nalliance with the great naval powers of Continental Europe had been\r\npossible. But Holland was now at peace with England; not to say that\r\nsuch an arrangement was out of the question for Massachusetts, while\r\n_the rest of New England was more or less inclined to the adverse\r\ninterest_. Unembarrassed by any foreign war, England was armed with that\r\nefficient navy which the Duke of York had organized, and which had\r\nlately distressed the rich and energetic Netherlanders; and the\r\ndwellings of two-thirds of the inhabitants of Massachusetts stood where\r\nthey could be battered from the water. They had a commerce which might\r\nbe molested in every sea by English cruisers. Neither befriended nor\r\ninterfered with, they might have been able to defend themselves against\r\nthe corsairs of Barbary in the resorts of their most gainful trade; but\r\nEngland had given them notice, that if they were stubborn that commerce\r\nwould be dismissed from her protection, and in the circumstances such a\r\nnotice threatened more than a mere abstinence from aid. The Indian war\r\nhad emptied the colonial exchequer. On the other hand, a generation\r\nearlier the colonists might have retreated to the woods, but now they\r\nhad valuable stationary property to be kept or sacrificed. To say no\r\nmore, the ancient unanimity was broken in upon. Jealousy had risen and\r\ngrown.... Nor was even public morality altogether of its pristine tone.\r\nThe prospect of material prosperity had introduced a degree of luxury;\r\nand luxury had brought ambition and mean longings. Venality had become\r\npossible; and clever and venal men had a motive for enlisting the\r\nselfish and the stupid, and decrying the generous and wise.\"[203]\r\n\r\nThese eloquent words of Dr. Palfrey are very suggestive, and deserve to\r\nbe carefully pondered by the reader.\r\n\r\nI. In the concluding sentences he tacitly admits that the Government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay had become, at the end of fifty-four years, partially\r\nat least, a failure in \"public morality\" and patriotism; yet during that\r\nperiod the Government had been exclusively, in both its legislation and\r\nadministration, in the hands of one religious denomination, under the\r\ninfluence of its ministers, who were supported by taxation on the whole\r\npopulation, controlled the elections, and whose counsels ruled in all\r\nconflicts with the King and Parliament of England. None but a\r\nCongregationalist could be a governor, or assistant, or deputy, or\r\njudge, or magistrate, or juror, or officer of the army, or constable, or\r\nelector, or have liberty of worship. The union of Church and State in\r\nMassachusetts was more intimate and intolerant than it had or ever has\r\nbeen in England; and their contests with England in claiming absolute\r\nand irresponsible powers under the Charter were at bottom, and in\r\nsubstance, contests for Congregational supremacy and exclusive and\r\nproscriptive rule in Church and State--facts so overlooked and\r\nmisrepresented by New England historians. Yet under this denominational\r\nand virtually hierarchical government, while wealth was largely\r\naccumulated, the \"pristine tone of public morality\" declined, and\r\npatriotism degenerated into \"ambition and venality.\"\r\n\r\nII. It is also worthy of remark, that, according to Dr. Palfrey, had not\r\nthe spirit of the first generation of the rulers of Massachusetts Bay\r\ndeparted, the war of the American Revolution would have been anticipated\r\nby a century, and the sword would have been unsheathed, not to maintain\r\nthe right of representation co-extensive with subjection to taxation,\r\nbut to maintain a Government which for half a century had taxed\r\nfour-fifths of its citizens without allowing them any representation,\r\nsupported the ministers of one Church by taxes on the whole population,\r\nand denied liberty of worship to any but the members of that one\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\nIII. I remark further, that Mr. Palfrey hints at the two real causes why\r\nthe disloyal party (calling itself the \"patriotic party\") did not take\r\nup arms of rebellion against the mother country. The one was _disunion_\r\nin the colony--\"the ancient unanimity was broken in upon.\" It has been\r\nseen that a majority of the \"Upper branch\" of even this denominational\r\nGovernment, and a large minority of the assembly of deputies, were in\r\nfavour of submitting to the conditions which the King had twenty years\r\nbefore prescribed as the terms of continuing the Charter. If the\r\ndefection from disloyalty was so great within the limits of the\r\ndenomination, it is natural to infer that it must have been universal\r\namong the four-fifths of the male population who were denied the rights\r\nand privileges of \"freemen,\" yet subject to all the burdens of the\r\nState. Deprived also of all freedom of the press, and punished by fine\r\nand imprisonment if, even in petitions to the local Legislature for\r\nredress of grievances, they complained of the acts of local legislation\r\nor government, they could only look to the mother country for\r\ndeliverance from local oppression, for liberty of worship and freedom of\r\ncitizens. The \"ministers\" had lost their ascendency even within the\r\nenfranchised circle of their own established churches, while the great\r\nbody of the disfranchised Nonconformists could only regard them as had\r\nthe Nonconformists in England regarded Bancroft and Laud. They could\r\nassume high prerogatives, arrogate to themselves divine favour and\r\nprotection, threaten divine judgments on their adversaries, boast of\r\ncourage and power; but they knew that in a trial of strength on the\r\nbattlefield their strength would prove weakness, and that they would be\r\nswept from power, and perhaps proscribed and oppressed by the very\r\nvictims of their intolerance. The \"breaking in upon ancient unanimity\"\r\nwas but the declining power of a disloyal Church and State Government\r\nof one denomination. A second cause hinted at by Dr. Palfrey why the\r\nrulers of Massachusetts Bay did not resort to arms at this time was,\r\nthat \"_the rest of New England was more or less inclined to the adverse\r\ninterest_.\" They could command no rallying watchword to combine the\r\nother New England colonies against the King, such as they were enabled\r\nto employ the following century to combine all the American colonies.\r\n\"The rest of New England\" had found that in the King and Council was\r\ntheir only effectual protection against the aggressions and domination\r\nof the rulers of Massachusetts Bay, who denied all right of appeal to\r\nthe Crown, and denied the right of the Crown to receive and decide upon\r\nsuch appeals. These rulers not only encroached upon the lands of\r\nneighbouring colonies, but interfered with their exercise of religious\r\ntoleration.[204] The extinction of the pretensions to supremacy and\r\nmonopoly of power and trade by the rulers of Massachusetts Bay, was the\r\nenfranchisement of the other New England Colonies to protection against\r\naggression, and of four-fifths of the male inhabitants of Massachusetts\r\nitself to the enjoyment of equal civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nI think therefore that \"ambitions and mean longings,\" and even\r\n\"venality,\" had quite as much to do on the part of those who wished to\r\nperpetuate the government of disloyalty, proscription, and persecution\r\nas on the part of those who desired to \"render unto Cæsar the things\r\nthat are Cæsar's,\" and to place the Government of Massachusetts, like\r\nthat of the other New England Colonies, upon the broad foundation of\r\nequal and general franchise and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression. After \"the fall of the Charter,\"\r\nNovember, 1684, the Congregationalists of Massachusetts Bay continued\r\ntheir government for two years, as if nothing had happened to their\r\nCharter; they promptly proclaimed and took the oath of allegiance to\r\nJames the Second; and two years afterwards sent the celebrated Increase\r\nMather as agent to England, to thank the King for the Proclamation of\r\nIndulgence, which trampled on English laws, and cost the King his\r\nthrone, to pray for the restoration of the Charter, and to accuse and\r\npray for the removal of the King's obnoxious Governor-General of New\r\nEngland, Sir Edmund Andros. The King received him very courteously, and\r\ngranted him several audiences. It would have been amusing to witness the\r\nexchange of compliments between the potent minister of Massachusetts\r\nCongregationalism and the bigoted Roman Catholic King of England; but\r\nthough James used flattering words, he bestowed no favours, did not\r\nrelax the rigour of his policy, and retained his Governor of New\r\nEngland. On the dethronement of James, Dr. Mather paid his homage to the\r\nrising sun of the new Sovereign--professed overflowing loyalty to\r\nWilliam and Mary,[205] and confirmed his professions by showing that his\r\nconstituents, on learning of the revolution in England, seized and sent\r\nprisoner to England, Andros, the hated representative of the dethroned\r\nKing. But King William did not seem to estimate very highly that sort\r\nof loyalty, much less to recognize the Massachusetts assumptions under\r\nthe old Charter, though he was ready to redress every just complaint and\r\nsecure to them all the privileges of British subjects.[207] Mr.\r\nHutchinson says: \"Soon after the withdrawal of King James, Dr. Mather\r\nwas introduced to the Prince of Orange by Lord Wharton, and presented\r\nthe circular before mentioned, for confirming Governors being sent to\r\nNew England. The 14th of March, Lord Wharton introduced him again to the\r\nKing, when, after humbly congratulating his Majesty on his accession,\r\nDr. Mather implored his Majesty's favour to New England. The King\r\npromised all the favour in his power, but hinted at what had been\r\nirregular in their former government; whereupon Dr. Mather undertook\r\nthat upon the first word they would reform any irregularities they\r\nshould be advised of, and Lord Wharton offered to be their guarantee.\r\nThe King then said that he would give orders that Sir Edmund Andros\r\nshould be removed and called to an account for his maladministration,\r\nand that the King and Queen should be proclaimed (in Massachusetts) by\r\nthe former magistrates. Dr. Mather was a faithful agent, and was\r\nunwearied in securing friends for his country. Besides several of the\r\nnobility and principal commoners, he had engaged the dissenting\r\nministers, whose weight at that time was far from inconsiderable.\"[208]\r\n\r\nDr. Mather's earnestness, ability, and appeals made a favourable\r\nimpression on the mind of the King, supported as they were by liberal\r\nChurchmen as well as Nonconformists, and also by the entreaties of the\r\nQueen. The King, on the eve of going to Holland, where he was long\r\ndetained--which delayed the issuing of the Massachusetts Charter for\r\ntwelve months--directed the Chief Justice, Attorney and\r\nSolicitor-Generals to prepare the draft of a new Charter for\r\nMassachusetts. They did so, embodying the provisions of the old Charter,\r\nwith additional provisions to give powers which had not been given but\r\nhad been usurped in the administration of the old Charter. The majority\r\nof the King's Council disapproved of this draft of Charter, and directed\r\nthe preparation of a second draft. Both drafts were sent over to Holland\r\nto the King, with the reasons for and against each; his Majesty agreed\r\nwith the majority of his Council in disapproving of the first, and\r\napproving of the second draft of Charter.[209]\r\n\r\nBut even before the King and his Council decided upon the provisions of\r\nthe new Charter, he determined upon appointing a Governor for\r\nMassachusetts, while meeting their wishes as far as possible in his\r\nselection of the Governor; for, as Mr. Neal says, \"Two days after he had\r\nheard Dr. Mather against continuing the Governor and officers appointed\r\nover Massachusetts by King James the Second, but restoring the old\r\nofficers, the King inquired of the Chief Justice and some other Lords of\r\nthe Council whether, without the breach of law, he might appoint a\r\nGovernor over New England? To which they answered that whatever might be\r\nthe merits of the cause, inasmuch as the Charter of New England stood\r\nvacated by a judgment against them, it was in the King's power to put\r\nthem under that form of government he should think best for them. The\r\nKing replied, he believed then it would be for the advantage of the\r\npeople of that colony to be under a Governor appointed by himself;\r\nnevertheless, because of what Dr. Mather had spoken to him, he would\r\nconsent that the agents of New England should nominate such a person as\r\nwould be agreeable to the inclinations of the people there; but,\r\nnotwithstanding this, he would have Charter privileges restored and\r\nconfirmed to them.\"[210]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that King William was not actuated by any theoretical\r\nnotions of high prerogative, as attributed to him by Messrs. Bancroft\r\nand Palfrey, in regard to Massachusetts, but was anxious to restore to\r\nthat colony every just privilege and power desired, with the exception\r\nof the power of the Congregationalists of Massachusetts to prosecute and\r\npersecute their fellow-religionists of other persuasions, and of\r\ndepriving them and other colonists of the right of appeal to the\r\nprotection of England.[211] This continued possession of usurped powers\r\nby the Congregationalists of Massachusetts, of sole legislation and\r\ngovernment under the first Charter, and which they so mercilessly and\r\ndisloyally exercised for more than half a century, was manifestly the\r\nreal ground of their opposition to a new Charter, and especially to the\r\nsecond and final draft of it. Their agent in England, Dr. Increase\r\nMather, who had inflamed and caused the citizens of Boston, and a\r\nmajority of the popular Assembly of the Legislature, to reject the\r\nconditions insisted upon by Charles the Second, and contest in a Court\r\nof law the continuance of the first Charter, with their pretensions\r\nunder it, said that he would rather die than consent to the provisions\r\nof the second draft of Charter,[212] and sent his objections to it to\r\nKing William, who was in Holland. The King disapproved of Dr. Mather's\r\nobjections, and approved of the Charter as revised and as was finally\r\nissued, and under which Massachusetts was governed and prospered for\r\nthree-fourths of a century, notwithstanding the continued opposition of\r\na set of separationists and smugglers in Boston, who had always been the\r\nenemies of loyal and liberal government under the first Charter.[213]\r\nBut when the new Charter passed the Seals, and the nomination of the\r\nfirst Governor was left to the agent of Massachusetts, Dr. Mather\r\nchanged his language of protest into that of gratitude. He nominated Sir\r\nWilliam Phips; and on being introduced to the King, at parting, by the\r\nEarl of Nottingham, made the following speech:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I do, in behalf of New England, most humbly thank your Majesty, in\r\nthat you have been pleased by a Charter to restore English liberties\r\nunto them, to confirm them in their properties, and to grant them some\r\npeculiar privileges. I doubt not but your subjects will demean\r\nthemselves with that dutiful affection and loyalty to your Majesty, as\r\nthat you will see cause to enlarge your Royal favour towards them; and I\r\ndo most humbly thank your Majesty that you have been pleased to leave to\r\nthose that are concerned for New England to nominate their Governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Phips has been accordingly nominated by us at the Council\r\nBoard. He has done good service to the Crown, by enlarging your\r\ndominions and reducing Nova Scotia to your obedience; I know that he\r\nwill faithfully serve your Majesty to the utmost of his capacity; and if\r\nyour Majesty shall think fit to confirm him in that place, it will be a\r\nfurther obligation to your subjects there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon Sir William Phips was admitted to kiss his Majesty's hand; and\r\nwas, by commission under the Broad Seal, appointed Captain-General over\r\nthe Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England.\"[214]\r\n\r\nIn the preamble of the Charter, the dates, objects and provisions of\r\nprevious Charters are recited, and titles to property, etc., acquired\r\nunder them confirmed; after which it was provided--\r\n\r\n1. That there should be \"one Governor, one Lieutenant or Deputy\r\nGovernor, one Secretary of the Province, twenty-eight councillors or\r\nmembers of assembly, to be chosen by popular election, and to possess\r\nand exercise the general powers of legislation and government.\"\r\n\r\n2. That there should be \"liberty of conscience allowed in the worship of\r\nGod to all Christians (except Papists) inhabiting, or which shall\r\ninhabit or be resident within our said province or territory.\"\r\n\r\n3. That \"all our subjects should have liberty to appeal to us, our heirs\r\nand successors, in case either party shall not rest satisfied with the\r\njudgment or sentence of any judicatories or courts within our said\r\nprovince or territory, in any personal action wherein the matter of\r\ndifference doth exceed the value of three hundred pounds sterling,\r\nprovided such appeals be made within fourteen days after the sentence or\r\njudgment given.\"\r\n\r\n4. That the Governor and General Assembly should have \"full power and\r\nauthority, from time to time, to make, ordain and establish all manner\r\nof wholesome and reasonable orders, laws, statutes or ordinances,\r\ndirections, and instructions, either with penalties or without (so as\r\nthe same be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of this our realm of\r\nEngland), as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of our said\r\nprovince or territory.\"\r\n\r\n5. That in the framing and passing of all orders, laws, etc., the\r\nGovernor should have \"a negative voice, subject also to the approbation\r\nor disallowance of the King within three years after the passing\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\n6. That \"every freeholder or person holding land within the province or\r\nterritory, to the annual value of forty shillings, or other estate of\r\nfifty pounds sterling, should have a vote in the election of members to\r\nserve in the General Court or Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n7. That \"the King should appoint, from time to time, the Governor,\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and Secretary of the Province; but that the\r\nGovernor, with the advice and consent of the Council or Assistants, from\r\ntime to time should nominate and appoint Judges, Commissioners of Oyer\r\nand Terminer, Sheriffs, Provosts, Marshals, Justices of the Peace,\" etc.\r\n\r\n8. The usual oath of allegiance and supremacy was required to be taken\r\nby all persons appointed to office, free from the restrictions and\r\nneutralising mutilations introduced into the oath of allegiance by the\r\necclesiastico-political oligarchy of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under\r\nthe first Charter.\r\n\r\n9. The new Charter also incorporated \"_Plymouth_ and _Maine, and a tract\r\nfurther east_ in the province of Massachusetts.\" The Plymouth Colony of\r\nthe Pilgrim Fathers had existed from 1620 to 1690 as a separate Colonial\r\nGovernment, first established by common consent, under seven successive\r\nGovernors. It now ceased to exist as a distinct Government, to the great\r\nregret of its inhabitants, after having been administered tolerantly and\r\nloyally for a period of seventy years, as has been narrated above, in\r\nChap. II.\r\n\r\nSuch is an abstract of the provisions of the second Massachusetts\r\nCharter--provisions similar to those which have been incorporated into\r\nthe constitution and government of every British North American Province\r\nfor the last hundred years.[215]\r\n\r\nIt remains to note how the new Charter was received, and what was the\r\neffect of its operation. A faction in Boston opposed its reception, and\r\ndesired to resume the old contests; but a large majority of the deputies\r\nand the great body of the colony cordially and thankfully accepted the\r\nnew Charter as a great improvement upon the first Charter in terminating\r\ntheir disputes and defining their relations with England, in putting an\r\nend to a denominational franchise and tyranny inconsistent with\r\nreligious or civil liberty, and in placing the elective franchise,\r\neligibility to office, legislation and government upon the broad\r\nfoundation of public freedom and equal rights to all classes of\r\ncitizens.[216]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the new Charter upon the social state of Massachusetts,\r\nas well as upon its legislation and government, was manifestly\r\nbeneficial. Judge Story observes: \"After the grant of the provincial\r\nCharter, in 1691, the legislation of the colony took a wider scope, and\r\nbecame more liberal as well as more exact.\"[217]\r\n\r\nThe improved spirit of loyalty was not less conspicuous. Mr. Neal,\r\nwriting more than twenty years (1720) after the granting of the new\r\nCharter, says: \"The people of New England are a dutiful and loyal\r\npeople.... King George is not known to have a single enemy to his\r\nperson, family, or government in New England.\"[218]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the new state of things upon the spirit of toleration\r\nand of Christian charity among Christians of different denominations,\r\nand on society at large, was most remarkable. In a sermon preached on a\r\npublic Fast Day, March 22, 1716 (and afterwards published), by the Rev.\r\nMr. Coleman, one of the ministers of Boston, we have the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"If there be any customs in our Churches, derived from our ancestors,\r\nwherein those terms of Church communion are imposed which Christ has not\r\nimposed in the New Testament, they ought to be laid aside, for they are\r\njustly to be condemned by us, because we complain of imposing in other\r\ncommunions, and our fathers fled for the same. If there ever was a\r\ncustom among us, whereby communion in our Churches was made a test for\r\nthe enjoyment of civil privileges in the State, we have done well long\r\nsince to abolish such corrupt and persecuting maxims, which are a\r\nmischief to any free people, and a scandal to any communion to retain.\r\nIf there were of old among our fathers any laws enacted or judgments\r\ngiven or executions done according to those laws which have carried too\r\nmuch the face of cruelty and persecution, we ought to be humbled greatly\r\nfor such errors of our fathers, and confess them to have been sinful;\r\nand blessed be God for the more catholic spirit of charity which now\r\ndistinguishes us. Or if any of our fathers have dealt proudly in\r\ncensuring and judging others who differed from them in modes of worship,\r\nlet us their posterity the rather be clothed with humility, meekness,\r\nand charity, preserving truth and holiness with the laudable zeal of our\r\npredecessors\" (pp. 20, 21, 22).\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Cotton Mather, the distinguished son of the famous Rev. Dr.\r\nIncrease Mather, but more tolerant than his father, has a passage\r\nequally significant and suggestive with that just quoted from Mr.\r\nColeman:\r\n\r\n\"In this capital city of Boston,\" says Dr. Cotton Mather, \"there are ten\r\nassemblies of Christians of different persuasions, who live lovingly and\r\npeaceably together, doing all the offices of good neighbourhood for one\r\nanother in such manner as may give a sensible rebuke to all the bigots\r\nof uniformity, and show them how consistent a variety of rites in\r\nreligion may be with the tranquillity of human society, and may\r\ndemonstrate to the world that such persecution for conscientious\r\ndissents in religion is an _abomination of desolation_--a thing whereof\r\nall wise and just men will say, _cursed be its anger, for it is fierce,\r\nand its wrath, for it is cruel_.\"[219]\r\n\r\nIt is not needful that I should trace the legislation and government of\r\nthe Province of Massachusetts under the second Charter with the same\r\nminuteness with which I have narrated that of Massachusetts Bay under\r\nthe first Charter. The successive Governors appointed by England over\r\nthe province were, upon the whole, men of good sense, and were\r\nsuccessful in their administration, notwithstanding the active\r\nopposition of a Boston disaffected party that prevented any salary being\r\ngranted to the Judges or Governor for more than one year at a time. Yet,\r\nupon the whole, the new system of government in the Province of\r\nMassachusetts was considered preferable to that of the neighbouring\r\ncolonies of Rhode Island and Connecticut, which retained their old\r\nCharters and elected their Governors. Mr. Hutchinson says:\r\n\r\n\"Seventy years' practice under a new Charter, in many respects to be\r\npreferred to the old, has taken away not only all expectation, but all\r\ndesire, of ever returning to the old Charter. We do not envy the\r\nneighbouring Governments which retained and have ever since practised\r\nupon their ancient Charters. Many of the most sensible in those\r\nGovernments would be glad to be under the same Constitution that the\r\nMassachusetts Province happily enjoys.\"[220]\r\n\r\nBut Massachusetts and other New England colonies had incurred\r\nconsiderable debts in their wars with the Indians, prompted and aided by\r\nthe French, who sought the destruction of the English colonies. But most\r\nof these debts were incurred by loans to individual inhabitants and by\r\nthe issue of paper money, which became greatly depreciated and caused\r\nmuch confusion and embarrassment in the local and Transatlantic\r\ntrade.[221]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war between England and France by the peace and\r\ntreaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1749, Mr. Hutchinson thus describes the state\r\nof Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n\"The people of Massachusetts Bay were never in a more easy and happy\r\nsituation than at the conclusion of the war with France (1749). By the\r\ngenerous reimbursement of the whole charge (£183,000) incurred by the\r\nexpedition against Cape Breton, the province was set free from a heavy\r\ndebt in which it must otherwise have remained involved, and was enabled\r\nto exchange a depreciating paper medium, which had long been the sole\r\ninstrument of trade, for a stable medium of silver and gold; the\r\nadvantages whereof to all branches of their commerce was evident, and\r\nexcited the envy of other colonies; in each of which paper was the\r\nprincipal currency.\"[222]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Palfrey's History of New England, Vol. III., B. iii.,\r\nChap. ix, pp. 396-398.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: The Plymouth Colony tolerating the proscribed Baptists of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, the Court of Massachusetts Bay admonished them in a\r\nletter, in 1649, saying \"that it had come to its knowledge that divers\r\nAnabaptists had been connived at within the Plymouth jurisdiction, and\r\nit appeared that the 'patient bearing' of the Plymouth authorities had\r\n'encreased' the same errors; that thirteen or fourteen persons (it was\r\nreported) had been re-baptized at Sea Cunke, under which circumstances\r\n'effectual restriction' was desired, 'the more as the interests of\r\nMassachusetts were concerned therein.'

This colony (of\r\nRhode Island) could never be acknowledged (by Massachusetts) for a\r\ncolony till his Majesty's Charter was published (in 1663), though in the\r\nyear 1643 they sent over some in England to procure the King's Charter;\r\nbut finding that unnatural war begun, and the King gone from London,\r\nthey took a Charter from the Lords and Commons.\" (Report of the King's\r\nCommissioners, in Hutchinson's Collection of Original Papers relative to\r\nthe History of Massachusetts Bay, pp. 415, 416.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: In an audience of King William, obtained by the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, April 28, 1691, Mr. Mather humbly prayed his Majesty's\r\nfavour to New England in restoring the old Charter privileges; adding at\r\nthe same time these words: \"Sir,--Your subjects there have been willing\r\nto venture their lives to enlarge your dominions; the expedition to\r\nCanada was a great and noble undertaking. May it please your Majesty\r\nalso to consider the circumstances of that people, as in your wisdom you\r\nhave considered the circumstances of England and Scotland. In New\r\nEngland they differ from other Plantations; they are called\r\nCongregationalists and Presbyterians[206], so that such a Governor as\r\nwill not suit with the people of New England, may be very proper for\r\nother English Plantations.\" (Neal's History of New England, Vol. II.,\r\nChap. xi., pp. 475, 476.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: This was very ingenious on the part of Dr. Increase\r\nMather to say that the people of New England were called \"Presbyterians\"\r\nas well as \"Congregationalists,\" as the Church of Holland, of which King\r\nWilliam as Prince of Orange was Stadtholder, was \"Presbyterian.\" But Dr.\r\nMather did not inform the King that the Presbyterian worship was no more\r\ntolerated in Massachusetts than was the Baptist or Episcopalian\r\nworship.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: \"The Rev. Mr. Increase Mather, Rector of Harvard College,\r\nhad been at Court in the year 1688, and laid before the King a\r\nrepresentation of their grievances, which the King promised in part to\r\nredress, but was prevented by the revolution. When the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Orange were settled on the throne, he, with the rest of the\r\nNew England agents, addressed their Majesties for the restoring of their\r\nCharter, and applied to the Convention Parliament, who received a Bill\r\nfor this purpose and passed it in the Lower House; but that Parliament\r\nbeing soon dissolved, the Bill was lost.\" (Neal's History of New\r\nEngland, Vol. II., Chap. xi., p. 474.)\r\n\r\nMr. J.G. Barry says: \"Anxious for the restoration of the old Charter and\r\nits privileges, under which the colony had prospered so well, the agent\r\napplied himself diligently to that object, advising with the wisest\r\nstatesmen for its accomplishment. It was the concurrent judgment of all\r\nthat the best course would be to obtain a reversion of the judgment\r\nagainst the Charter by Act of Parliament, and then apply to the King for\r\nsuch additional privileges as were necessary. Accordingly in the\r\n(Convention) House of Commons, _where the whole subject of seizing\r\nCharters in the reign of Charles the Second was up, the Charters of New\r\nEngland were inserted with the rest_, and though enemies opposed the\r\nmeasure, it was voted with the rest as a grievance, and that they should\r\nbe forthwith restored. Thus the popular branch of the Parliament acted\r\nfavourably towards the colonies; but as the Bill was yet to be submitted\r\nto the House of Lords, great pains were taken to interest that branch of\r\nthe Parliament in the measure; and at the same time letters having\r\narrived giving an account of the proceedings in Boston, another\r\ninterview was held with the King, before whom, in 'a most excellent\r\nspeech,' Mr. Mather 'laid the state of the people,' and his Majesty was\r\npleased to signify his acceptance of what had been done in New England,\r\nand his intention to restore the inhabitants to their ancient\r\nprivileges; but 'behold,' adds the narrative, 'while the Charter Bill\r\nwas depending, the Convention Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued and\r\nafterwards dissolved, and the Sisyphæan labour of the whole year came to\r\nnothing.' All that was obtained was an order that the Government of the\r\ncolony should be continued under the old Charter until a new one was\r\nsettled; and a letter from the King was forwarded to that effect, signed\r\nby the Earl of Nottingham, for the delivery of Sir Edmund Andros and the\r\nothers detained with him, who were to be sent to England for trial.\"\r\n(Barry's History of Massachusetts, First Period, Chap. xviii., pp.\r\n508-510.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp.\r\n388, 389. But, in addition, Mr. Mather had the countenance of Archbishop\r\nTillotson and Bishop Burnet, who had not only received him kindly, but\r\nrecommended his applications to the favourable consideration of the\r\nKing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: The King, on starting for Holland, \"left orders with his\r\nAttorney-General to draw up a draft of Charter, according as his Majesty\r\nexpressed in Council, to be ready for him to sign at his return. The\r\nAttorney-General presented his draft to the Council Board, June the 8th\r\n(1691), which was rejected, and a new one ordered to be drawn up, which\r\ndeprived the people of New England of several essential privileges\r\ncontained in their former Charter. Mr. Mather in his great zeal\r\nprotested against it; but was told that the agents of New England were\r\nnot plenipotentiaries from a foreign State, and therefore must submit to\r\nthe King's pleasure. The agents, having obtained a copy of this Charter,\r\nsent over their objections against it to the King, in Flanders, praying\r\nthat certain clauses which they pointed out to his Majesty in their\r\npetition might be altered. And the Queen herself, with her own royal\r\nhand, wrote to the King that the Charter of New England might pass as it\r\nwas drawn up by the Attorney-General at first, or be deferred till his\r\nreturn. But, after all, it was his Majesty's pleasure that the Charter\r\nof New England should run in the main points according to the second\r\ndraft; and all that the agents could do was to get two or three articles\r\nwhich they apprehended to be for the good of the country added to it.\r\nThe expectations of the people (of the Congregationalists) of New\r\nEngland were very much disappointed, and their agents were censured as\r\nmen not very well skilled in the intrigues of a Court. It was thought\r\nthat if they had applied themselves to the proper persons, and in a\r\nright way, they might have made better terms for their country; but they\r\nacted in the uprightness of their hearts, though the success did not\r\nanswer their expectations. It was debated among them whether they should\r\naccept of the new Charter or stand a trial at law for reversing the\r\njudgment against the old one; but, upon the advice of some of the best\r\npoliticians and lawyers, the majority resolved to acquiesce in the\r\nKing's pleasure and accept what was now offered them.\" (Neal's History\r\nof New England, Vol. II., Chap, xi., pp. 476, 477.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Neal's History of New England, Vol. II., Chap, xi., p.\r\n476.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts would doubtless have retained the election of their\r\nGovernor and their first Charter, as did the colonies of Rhode Island\r\nand Connecticut, had her rulers submitted to the conditions on which\r\nCharles the Second proposed to continue their Charter. Mr. Hildreth\r\nsays: \"The Charters of Connecticut and Rhode Island never having been\r\nformally annulled, and having already been resumed, were pronounced by\r\nthe English lawyers to be in full force.... The English lawyers held\r\nthat the judgment which Massachusetts had persisted in braving was\r\nbinding and valid in law, until renewed by a writ of error, of which\r\nthere was little or no hope.\" (History of the United States, Chap,\r\nxviii., pp. 94, 95.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: The platform of Church government which they settled was\r\nof the Congregational mode, connecting the several Churches together to\r\na certain degree, and yet exempting each of them from any jurisdiction,\r\nby way of censure or any power extensive to their own.... No man could\r\nbe qualified to elect or be elected to office who was not a Church\r\nmember, and no Church could be formed but by a license from a\r\nmagistrate; so that the civil and ecclesiastical powers were intimately\r\ncombined. The clergy were consulted about the laws, were frequently\r\npresent at the passing of them, and by the necessity of their influence\r\nin the origination, demonstrated how much the due execution of them\r\ndepended on their power.\r\n\r\n\"But the error of establishing one rule for all men in ecclesiastical\r\npolicy and discipline (which experience has proved cannot be maintained,\r\neven in matters of indifference) could not fail of discovering itself in\r\nvery serious instances as the Society increased. The great body of the\r\nEnglish nation being of a different persuasion in this respect, numbers\r\nbelonging to their Church, who came into the country, necessarily formed\r\nan opposition which, as they had the countenance of the King, could not\r\nbe crushed like those other sectaries. It became a constant subject of\r\nroyal attention, to allow freedom and liberty of conscience, especially\r\nin the use of the Common Prayer, and the rights of sacrament and baptism\r\nas thereby prescribed. The law confining the rights of freemen to Church\r\nmembers was at length repealed (in pretence); and pecuniary\r\nqualifications for those who were not Church members, with good morals\r\nand the absurd requisite of orthodoxy of opinion, certified by a\r\nclergyman, were substituted in its place. But the great ascendency which\r\nthe Congregationalists had gained over every other sect made the chance\r\nof promotion to office, and the share of influence in general, very\r\nunequal, and was, without doubt, one of the most important causes which\r\nconspired to the loss of the Charter.\" (Minot's Continuation of the\r\nHistory of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, etc., Vol. I., Chap. i,\r\npp. 29-31.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: \"Mr. Mather was so dissatisfied that he declared that he\r\nwould sooner part with his life than consent to them. He was told 'the\r\nagents of Massachusetts were not plenipotentiaries from a sovereign\r\nState; if they declared they would not submit to the King's pleasure,\r\nhis Majesty would settle the country, and they might take what would\r\nfollow.' Sir Henry Ashurst with Mr. Mather withdrew, notwithstanding,\r\ntheir objections against the minutes of Council. The objections were\r\npresented to the Attorney-General (Treby), and laid before the Council,\r\nand a copy sent to the King in Flanders; but all had no effect. The King\r\napproved of the minutes and disliked the objections to them, and the\r\nCharter was drawn up by Mr. Blaithwait according to them.\" (Hutchinson's\r\nHistory of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 409-411.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: \"A people who were of opinion that their Commonwealth was\r\nestablished by free consent (_a_); that the place of their habitation\r\nwas their own; that no man had a right to enter into their society\r\nwithout their permission; that they had the full and absolute power of\r\ngoverning all the people by men chosen from among themselves, and\r\naccording to such laws as they should see fit to establish, not\r\nrepugnant to those of England (a restriction and limitation which they\r\nwholly ignored and violated), they paying only the fifth part of the ore\r\nof gold and silver that should be there found for all duties, demands,\r\nexactions, and services whatsoever; of course, that they held the keys\r\nof their territory, and had a right to prescribe the terms of\r\nnaturalization to all noviciates; such a people, I say, whatever\r\nalterations they might make in their polity, from reason and conviction\r\nof their own motion, would not be easily led to comply with the same\r\nchanges, when required by a king to whom they held themselves subject,\r\nand upon whose authority they were dependent only according to their\r\nCharter; and we shall find that their compliance was accordingly slow\r\nand occasional, as necessity compelled them to make it.\" (Minot's\r\nContinuation of the History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 42, 43.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Note_ by the Author.--The Colony of Plymouth was established in\r\n1620, by free consent, by the Pilgrim Fathers on board of the\r\n_Mayflower_, without a Charter; yet that colony was always tolerant and\r\nloyal. But the Colony of Massachusetts Bay was established by the\r\nPuritan Fathers in 1629, under the authority of a Royal Charter; and it\r\nwas the pretension to and assumption of independent power and absolute\r\ngovernment, though a chartered colony, that resulted in their disloyalty\r\nto England and intolerance towards all classes of their fellow-colonists\r\nnot Congregationalists.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Neal's History of New England, Vol. II., pp. 480, 481.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Phips was born, of mean and obscure parents, at a small\r\nplantation in the eastern part of New England, on the banks of the River\r\nKennebeck, February 2, 1620; his father was a gunsmith, and left his\r\nmother a widow, with a large family of small children. William, being\r\none of the youngest, kept sheep in the wilderness until he was eighteen\r\nyears of age, and was then bound apprentice to a ship carpenter. When he\r\nwas out of his time he took to the sea, and after several adventures, at\r\nlast made his fortune by finding a Spanish wreck near Port de la Plata,\r\nwhich got him a great deal of reputation at the English Court, and\r\nintroduced him into the acquaintance of the greatest men of the nation.\r\nThough King James II. gave him the honour of knighthood, yet he always\r\nopposed his arbitrary measures, as appears by his refusing the\r\nGovernment of New England when offered to him by a messenger of the\r\nabdicated King. Sir William joined heartily in the Revolution, and used\r\nhis interest at the Court of King William and Queen Mary for obtaining a\r\nCharter for his country, in conjunction with the rest of the agents, for\r\nwhich, and his other great services, they nominated him to the King as\r\nthe most acceptable and deserving person they could think of for\r\nGovernor.\"--_Ib._, pp. 544, 545.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Modern historians of New England generally speak of the\r\nMassachusetts Colony as having been unjustly deprived of its first\r\nCharter, after having faithfully observed it for more than half a\r\ncentury, and of having been treated harshly in not having the Charter\r\nrestored. While Dr. Mather was earnestly seeking the restoration of the\r\nCharter at the hands of King William, Mr. Hampden (grandson of the\r\nfamous John Hampden) consulted Mr. Hooke, a counsellor of note of the\r\nPuritan party, and friend of New England. Mr. Hooke stated that \"a bare\r\nrestoration of the Charter of Massachusetts would be of no service at\r\nall,\" as appears both from the Charter itself and the practice of that\r\ncolony, who have hardly pursued the terms thereof in any one instance,\r\nwhich has given colour to evil-minded men to give them disturbance.\r\n\r\n\"I. As to the Charter itself, that colony, should they have their\r\nCharter, would want--\r\n\r\n\"1. Power to call a Parliament, or select assembly; for their many\r\nthousand freemen have, thereby, an equal right to sit in their General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\"2. Power to levy taxes and raise money, especially on inhabitants not\r\nbeing of the company, and strangers coming to or trading thither.\r\n\r\n\"3. They have not any Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\"4. Nor have they power to keep a Prerogative Court, prove wills, etc.\r\n\r\n\"5. Nor to erect Courts of Judicature, especially Chancery Courts.\r\n\r\n\"II. The deficiency of their Charter appears from their practice,\r\nwherein they have not had respect thereto; but having used the aforesaid\r\npowers without any grant, they have exercised their Charter powers,\r\nalso, otherwise than the Charter directed:\r\n\r\n\"1. They have made laws contrary to the laws of England.\r\n\r\n\"2. Their laws have not been under their seal.\r\n\r\n\"3. They have not used their name of corporation.\r\n\r\n\"4. They have not used their seal in their grants.\r\n\r\n\"5. They have not kept their General Courts, nor\r\n\r\n\"6. Have they observed the number of assistants appointed by the\r\nCharter.\" (Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 410,\r\n411, in a note.)\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the legal opinion, as has been shown in the foregoing\r\npages, that the first Puritans of Massachusetts, though only a chartered\r\ncompany, set up an independent government, paid no attention whatever to\r\nthe provisions of the Charter under which they held their land and had\r\nsettled the colony, but acted in entire disregard and defiance of the\r\nauthority, which had granted their Charter. Mr. Neal very candidly says:\r\n\"The old Charter was, in the opinion of persons learned in the law,\r\ndefective as to several powers which are absolutely necessary to the\r\nsubsistence of the Plantation: for example, it gave the Government no\r\nmore power than every corporation in England has; power in capital cases\r\nwas not expressed in it; it mentioned no House of Deputies, or Assembly\r\nof Representatives; the Government had thereby no legal power to impose\r\ntaxes on the inhabitants that were not freemen (that is, on\r\n_four-fifths_ of the male population), nor to erect Courts of Admiralty,\r\nso that if the judgment against this Charter should be reversed, yet if\r\nthe Government of New England should exercise the same powers as they\r\nhad done before the _quo warranto_, a new writ of _scire facias_ might\r\nundoubtedly be issued out against them. Besides, if the old Charter\r\nshould have been restored without a grant of some other advantages, the\r\ncountry would have been very much incommoded, because the provinces of\r\n_Maine_ and _New Hampshire_ would have been taken from Massachusetts,\r\nand _Plymouth_ would have been annexed to New York, whereby the\r\nMassachusetts Colony would have been very much straitened and have made\r\na mean figure both as to its trade and influence.\r\n\r\n\"The new Charter grants a great many privileges to New England which it\r\nhad not before. The colony is now made a province, and the General Court\r\nhas, with the King's approbation, as much power in New England as the\r\nKing and Parliament have in England. They have all English liberties,\r\nand can be touched by no law, by no tax, but of their own making. All\r\nthe liberties of their religion are for ever secured, and their titles\r\nto their lands, once, for want of some form of conveyance, contested,\r\nare now confirmed for ever.\" (History of New England, Vol. II., pp. 478,\r\n479.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Although a party was formed which opposed submission to\r\nthe Charter, yet the majority of the Court wisely and thankfully\r\naccepted it, and appointed a day of solemn thanksgiving to Almighty God\r\nfor \"granting a safe arrival to His Excellency the Governor and the Rev.\r\nMr. Increase Mather, who have industriously endeavoured the service of\r\nthe people, and have brought over with them 'a settlement of government,\r\nin which their Majesties have graciously given us distinguishing marks\r\nof their Royal favour and goodness.'\" (Hutchinson's History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 416.)\r\n\r\nJudge Story remarks: \"With a view to advance the growth of the province\r\nby encouraging new settlements, it was expressly provided 'that there\r\nshould be liberty of conscience allowed in the worship of God to all\r\nChristians, except Papists;' and that all subjects inhabiting in the\r\nprovince, and their children born there, or on the seas going and\r\nreturning, should have all the liberties and immunities of free and\r\nnatural subjects, as if they were born within the realm of England. And\r\nin all cases an appeal was allowed from the judgments of any Courts of\r\nthe province to the King in the Privy Council in England, where the\r\nmatter of difference exceeded three hundred pounds sterling. And finally\r\nthere was a reservation of the whole Admiralty jurisdiction to the\r\nCrown, and of the right to all subjects to fish on the coasts.\r\nConsidering the spirit of the times, it must be acknowledged that, on\r\nthe whole, the Charter contains a liberal grant of authority to the\r\nprovince and a reasonable reservation of royal prerogative. It was\r\nhailed with sincere satisfaction by the colony after the dangers which\r\nhad so long a time menaced its liberties and peace.\" (Story's\r\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. I., Book i.,\r\nChap. iv., p. 41.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: _Ib._, Vol. I., Book i., Chap. iv., p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: History of New England, Vol. II., p. 616.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Fellowship of the Churches: Annexed to the Sermon\r\npreached on the Ordination of Mr. Prince, p. 76; Boston, 1718; quoted in\r\nNeal's History of New England, Vol. II., pp. 610, 611.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of the old leaven of bigotry and persecution remained\r\nwith not a few of the old Congregational clergy, who were jealous for\r\nthe honour of those days when they ruled both Church and State, silenced\r\nand proscribed all dissenters from their own opinions and forms of\r\nworship. They could not endure any statements which reflected upon the\r\njustice and policy of those palmy days of ecclesiastical oligarchy, and\r\nwere very much stung by some passages in Neal's History of New England.\r\nThe celebrated Dr. Isaac Watts seems to have been written to on the\r\nsubject. His letter, apparently in reply, addressed to the Rev. Dr.\r\nCotton Mather, dated February 19, 1720, is very suggestive. The sweet\r\npoet and learned divine says:\r\n\r\n\"Another thing I take occasion to mention to you at this time is my good\r\nfriend Mr. Neal's History of New England. He has been for many years\r\npastor of a Congregational Church in London--a man of valuable talents\r\nin the ministry. I could wish indeed that he had communicated his design\r\nto you, but I knew nothing of it till it was almost out of the press....\r\nHe has taken merely the task of an historian upon him. Considered as\r\nsuch (as far as I can judge), most of the chapters are well written, and\r\nin such a way as to be very acceptable to the present age.\r\n\r\n\"But the freedom he has taken to expose the persecuting principles and\r\npractices of the first Planters, both in the body of his history and his\r\nabridgment of their laws, has displeased some persons here, and perhaps\r\nwill be offensive there. I must confess I sent for him this week, and\r\ngave him my sense freely on this subject. I could wish he had more\r\nmodified some of his relations, and had rather left out those laws, or\r\nin some page had annexed something to prevent our enemies from insulting\r\nboth us and you on that subject. His answer was, that 'the fidelity of\r\nan historian required him to do what he had done;' and he has, at the\r\nend of the first and second volumes, given such a character of the\r\npresent ministers and inhabitants of the country as may justly secure\r\nthis generation from all scandal; and that it is a nobler thing to tell\r\nthe world that you have rectified the errors of your fathers, than if\r\nmere education had taught you so large a charity. He told me likewise\r\nthat he had shown in the preface that all such laws as are inconsistent\r\nwith the laws of England are, _ipso facto_, repealed by your new\r\nCharter. But methinks it would be better to have such cruel and\r\nsanguinary statutes as those under the title of 'Heresy' repealed in\r\nform, and by the public authority of the nation; and if the appearance\r\nof this book in your country shall awaken your General Assembly to\r\nattempt to fulfil such a noble piece of service to your country, there\r\nwill be a happy effect of that part of the history which now makes us\r\nblush and be ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"I have taken the freedom to write a line or two to your most excellent\r\nGovernor on this subject, which I entreat you to deliver, with my\r\nsalutation; and I assure myself that Dr. Mather will have a zealous hand\r\nin promoting so gracious a work if it may be thought expedient to\r\nattempt it.\" (Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, First\r\nSeries, Vol. V., pp. 200, 201.)\r\n\r\nThe \"glorious work\" advised by Dr. Watts was not \"attempted,\" and the\r\n\"cruel and persecuting statutes passed by the Congregational Court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay were never repealed by any \"public authority\" of that\r\ncolony, but were tacitly annulled and superseded by the provisions of\r\nthe \"new Charter\" of King William and Mary in favour of toleration and\r\ncivil liberty.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 415.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: The effect of so much paper was to drive all gold and\r\nsilver out of circulation, to raise the nominal prices of all\r\ncommodities, and to increase the rate of exchange on England. Great\r\nconfusion and perplexity ensued, and the community was divided in\r\nopinion, the most being urgent for the issue of more paper money. For\r\nthis purpose a project was started for a Land-Bank, which was\r\nestablished in Massachusetts, the plan of which was to issue bills upon\r\nthe pledge of lands. All who were in difficulty advocated this, because\r\nthey hoped that in the present case they might shift their burdens on to\r\nsome one else. It was then resisted, and another plan was devised and\r\ncarried (1714), namely, the issuing of £50,000 of bills of credit by\r\nGovernment, to be loaned to individuals at 5 per cent. interest, to be\r\nsecured by estates, and to be repaid one-fifth part yearly. This quieted\r\nthe Land-Bank party for a while. But the habit of issuing bills of\r\ncredit continued, and was very seductive.\r\n\r\n\"In 1741, Rhode Island issued £40,000 in paper money, to be loaned to\r\nthe inhabitants.

Louisburg, which\r\nhad been captured from the French in 1745 by the skill of the British\r\nAdmiral Warren, aided most courageously by the Massachusetts volunteers,\r\nwas therefore restored to the French, much to the regret and\r\nmortification of the New England colonies, by whom the enterprise\r\nagainst that powerful and troublesome fortress had first been devised\r\nand undertaken. By the treaty between France and England, the boundaries\r\nof their possessions in America were left undefined, and were to be\r\nsettled by Commissioners appointed by the two countries. But the\r\nCommissioners, when they met at Paris, could not agree; the questions of\r\nthese boundaries remained unsettled; and the French in Canada, with the\r\nIndians, nearly all of whom were in alliance with them, were constantly\r\nmaking aggressions and committing cruel outrages upon the English\r\ncolonists in the back parts of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\nVirginia, who felt that their only security for life, property, and\r\nliberty was the extinction of French power in America, and the\r\nsubjection of the Indians by conquest or conciliation. The six years\r\nwhich followed the peace of 1748 witnessed frequent and bloody\r\ncollisions between the English colonists and their French and Indian\r\nCanadian neighbours, until, in 1756, England formally declared war\r\nagainst France--a war which continued seven years, and terminated in the\r\nextinction of French power in Canada, and in the enlargement of the\r\nBritish possessions from Labrador to Florida and Louisiana, and from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific. This war, in its origin and many scenes of its\r\nconflicts and conquests, was an American-Colonial war, and the American\r\ncolonies were the gainers by its results, for which British blood and\r\ntreasure had been lavishly expended. In this protracted and eventful\r\nconflict, the British Government were first prompted and committed, and\r\nthen nobly seconded by the colonies, Massachusetts acting the most\r\nprominent part.\r\n\r\nThe last act of the British Government, pursuant to the treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in 1748, was to restore to the French Government Louisburg,\r\nin return for the strongly fortified fort of Madras, which had been\r\nwrested from the French by the colonists, assisted by Admiral Warren\r\nwith a few English ships in 1745; and the first act of the French\r\nGovernment, after the restoration to them of Louisburg, was to prepare\r\nfor wresting from Great Britain all her American colonies.[223] They\r\ndispatched soldiers and all kinds of military stores; encroached upon\r\nand built fortresses in the British province of Nova Scotia, and in the\r\nprovinces of Pennsylvania and Virginia,[224] and erected a chain of\r\nforts, and planted garrisons along the line of the British provinces,\r\nfrom the St. Lawrence to the Ohio river, and thence to the\r\nMississippi.[225]\r\n\r\nThe only means at the command of Great Britain to counteract and defeat\r\nthese designs of France to extinguish the English colonies in America\r\nwas to prevent them from carrying men, cannon, and other munitions of\r\nwar hither, by capturing their ships thus laden and employed; but the\r\nFrench Government thought that the British Government would not proceed\r\nto such extremities, for fear that the former would make war upon the\r\nGerman possessions of the latter, the King of England being the Elector\r\nof Hanover. Besides, the proceedings of the French in America were\r\nremote and concealed under various pretexts; the French Government could\r\noppose a general denial to the complaints made as to its encroachments\r\non British territory and settlements in the distant wilderness of\r\nAmerica; while any attack by England upon French ships at sea would be\r\nknown at once to all Europe, and excite prejudice against England for\r\nsuch an act in time of peace against a neighbouring nation. The designs\r\nand dishonesty of the French Government in these proceedings are thus\r\nstated by Rapin:\r\n\r\n\"Though the French in all their seaports were making the greatest\r\npreparations for supporting their encroachments in America, yet the\r\nstrongest assurances came to England from that Ministry that no such\r\npreparations were making, and that no hostility was intended by France\r\nagainst Great Britain or her dependencies. These assurances were\r\ngenerally communicated to the British Ministry by the Duke of Mirepoix,\r\nthe French Ambassador to London, who was himself so far imposed upon\r\nthat he believed them to be sincere, and did all in his power to prevent\r\na rupture between the two nations. The preparations, however, were so\r\nnotorious that they could be no longer concealed, and Mirepoix was\r\nupbraided at St. James's with being insincere, and the proofs of his\r\nCourt's double-dealing were laid before him. He appeared to be struck\r\nwith them; and complaining bitterly of his being imposed upon, he went\r\nin person over to France, where he reproached the Ministry for having\r\nmade him their tool. They referred him to their King, who ordered him to\r\nreturn to England with fresh assurances of friendship; but he had\r\nscarcely delivered them when undoubted intelligence came that a French\r\nfleet from Brest and Rochefort was ready to sail, with a great number of\r\nland forces on board. The French fleet, which consisted of twenty-five\r\nships of the line, besides frigates and transports, with a vast number\r\nof warlike stores, and between three and four thousand land forces,\r\nunder Baron Dieskau, were ready to sail from Brest, under Admiral\r\nMacnamara. Upon this intelligence, Admiral Holbourne was ordered to\r\nreinforce Boscawen with six ships of the line and one frigate; and a\r\ngreat number of capital ships were put into commission. It was the 6th\r\nMay (1755) before Macnamara sailed; but he soon returned with nine of\r\nhis capital ships, and ordered the rest to proceed under the command of\r\nM. Bois de la Mothe.\r\n\r\n\"When news of so strong a squadron sailing from Brest was confirmed, the\r\npeople of England grew extremely uneasy for the fate of the squadron\r\nunder Boscawen and Holbourne; and it was undoubtedly owing to the bad\r\nmanagement of the French that one or both of those squadrons were not\r\ndestroyed.\"[226]\r\n\r\nThe King, in proroguing Parliament, the 27th of May, 1755, among other\r\nthings said:\r\n\r\n\"That he had religiously adhered to the stipulations of the treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and made it his care not to injure or offend any Power\r\nwhatsoever; but never could he entertain the thoughts of purchasing the\r\nname of peace at the expense of suffering encroachments upon, or\r\nyielding up, what justly belongs to Great Britain, either by ancient\r\npossession or solemn treaties. That the vigour and firmness of his\r\nParliament on this important occasion have enabled him to be prepared\r\nfor such contingencies as may happen. That, if reasonable and honourable\r\nterms of accommodation can be agreed upon, he will be satisfied, and in\r\nall events rely on the justice of his cause, the effectual support of\r\nhis people, and the protection of Divine Providence.\"[227]\r\n\r\nThis speech to Parliament was delivered a year before war was formally\r\ndeclared between England and France; and a year before that, in 1754, by\r\nroyal instructions, a convention of delegates from the Assemblies of the\r\nseveral Colonies was held at Albany, in the Province of New York. Among\r\nother things relative to the union and defence of the Colonies which\r\nengaged the attention of this Convention, \"a representation was agreed\r\nupon in which were set forth the unquestionable designs of the French to\r\nprevent the colonies from extending their settlements, a line of forts\r\nhaving been erected for this purpose, and many troops transported from\r\nFrance; and the danger the colonies were in of being driven by the\r\nFrench into the sea, was urged.\" The representation of the imminent\r\ndanger to the colonies from the French encroachments probably\r\naccelerated the measures in England which brought on the war with\r\nFrance.[228]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft endeavours again and again to convey the impression that\r\nthis seven years' war between England and France was a European war, and\r\nthat the American colonies were called upon, controlled, and attempted\r\nto be taxed to aid Great Britain in the contest; yet he himself, in one\r\nplace, admits the very reverse, and that Great Britain became involved\r\nin the war in defence of the American Colonies, as the facts above\r\nstated show, and as will appear more fully hereafter. Mr. Bancroft\r\nstates the whole character and objects of the war, in both America and\r\nEurope, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The contest, which had now (1757) spread into both hemispheres, _began\r\nin America. The English Colonies, dragging England into their strife_,\r\nclaimed to advance their frontier, and to include the great central\r\nvalley of the continent in their system. The _American_ question\r\ntherefore was, shall the continued colonization of North America be made\r\nunder the auspices of English Protestantism and popular liberty, or\r\nshall the tottering legitimacy of France, in its connection with Roman\r\nCatholic Christianity, win for itself a new empire in that hemisphere?\r\nThe question of the _European_ continent was, shall a Protestant\r\nrevolutionary kingdom, like Prussia, be permitted to rise up and grow\r\nstrong within its heart? Considered in its unity as interesting\r\n_mankind_, the question was, shall the Reformation, developed to the\r\nfulness of Free Inquiry, succeed in its protest against the Middle Age?\r\n\r\n\"The war that closed in 1748 had been a mere scramble for advantages,\r\nand was sterile of results; the present conflict, which was to prove a\r\nseven years' war, was against the unreformed; and this was so profoundly\r\ntrue, that all the predictions or personal antipathies of Sovereign and\r\nMinisters could not prevent the alliances, collisions, and results\r\nnecessary to make it so.\"[229]\r\n\r\nThe object and character of such a war for Protestantism and liberty, as\r\nforcibly stated by Mr. Bancroft himself, was as honourable to England,\r\nas the results of it have been beneficial to posterity and to the\r\ncivilization of mankind; yet Mr. Bancroft's sympathies throughout his\r\nbrilliant but often inconsistent pages are clearly with France against\r\nEngland, the policy and character of whose statesmen he taxes his utmost\r\ningenuity and researches to depreciate and traduce, while he admits they\r\nare engaged in the noblest struggle recorded in history.\r\n\r\nFrom 1748 to 1754, the contests in America were chiefly between the\r\ncolonists and the French and their Indian allies (except at sea), and\r\nwere for the most part unsuccessful on the part of the colonists, who\r\nlost their forts at Oswego and Niagara, and suffered other defeats and\r\nlosses. \"But in the year 1755,\" says Dr. Minot, \"the war in America\r\nbeing now no longer left to colonial efforts alone, the plan of\r\noperations consisted of three parts. The first was an attack on Fort du\r\nQuesne, conducted by troops from England under General Braddock; the\r\nsecond was upon the fort at Niagara, which was carried on by American\r\nregulars and Indians (of the Six Nations); and the third was an\r\nexpedition against Crown Point, which was supported by militia from the\r\nnorthern colonies, enlisted merely for that service.\"[230]\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Fort du Quesne ended in the disgraceful defeat\r\nand death of Braddock and one-third of his men, hundreds of whom were\r\nshot down by ambushed foes whom they never saw. The contemplated attack\r\nupon Niagara was never prosecuted; the expedition against Crown Point\r\nwas a failure, and exhaustive of the resources of Massachusetts; but,\r\nas a compensation, Colonel Johnson defeated and took prisoner the French\r\ngeneral, Baron Dieskau, for which the King made him a baronet, and the\r\nHouse of Commons voted him a grant of £5,000 sterling.[231]\r\n\r\nThe most was made in England as well as the colonies of this decisive\r\nvictory over a famous French general and his troops, as the year\r\notherwise was disastrous to the English, and \"the French, with the\r\nassistance of their Indian allies, continued their murders, scalping,\r\ncapturing, and laying waste the western frontiers of Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania during the whole winter.\"[232]\r\n\r\nNor were the years 1756 and 1757 more successful on the part of the\r\nEnglish than the year 1755. Some of the principal events are as follows:\r\nWar was formally declared by England against France in May, and declared\r\nby France against England in August. The expenses incurred by\r\nMassachusetts and other colonies in the unfortunate Crown Point\r\nexpedition were compensated by a parliamentary grant of £115,000\r\nsterling.[233]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Loudoun arrived from England as Governor of Virginia, to\r\ntake command of the British troops in America; but did little more than\r\nconsult with the Governors of the several provinces as to military\r\noperations for the ensuing year, the relations of provincial and regular\r\nofficers, the amount of men and means to be contributed by each province\r\nfor common defence. He gave much offence by his haughty and imperious\r\ndemands for the quartering of the troops in New York and in\r\nMassachusetts. Additional troops were sent from England, under\r\nMajor-General Abercrombie, who superseded the Earl of Loudoun as\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The fortress at Oswego was taken and destroyed by\r\nthe French.[234]\r\n\r\nThe French, led by Montcalm, took Fort William Henry.[235]\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Assembly refused to allow British troops to be\r\nquartered upon the inhabitants.[236]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1757, the situation of the colonies was\r\nalarming and the prospects of the war gloomy. The strong statements of\r\nMr. Bancroft are justified by the facts. He says: \"The English had been\r\ndriven from every cabin in the basin of the Ohio; Montcalm had destroyed\r\nevery vestige of their power within the St. Lawrence. France had her\r\nforts on each side of the lakes, and at Detroit, at Mackinaw, at\r\nKaskaskia, and at New Orleans. The two great valleys of the Mississippi\r\nand the St. Lawrence were connected chiefly by three well-known\r\nroutes--by way of Waterford to Fort du Quesne, by way of Maumee to the\r\nWabash, and by way of Chicago to the Illinois. Of the North American\r\ncontinent, the French claimed and seemed to possess twenty parts in\r\ntwenty-five, leaving four only to Spain, and but one to Britain. Their\r\nterritory exceeded that of the English twenty-fold. As the men composing\r\nthe garrison at Fort Loudoun, in Tennessee, were but so many hostages in\r\nthe hands of the Cherokees, the claims of France to the valleys of the\r\nMississippi and the St. Lawrence seemed established by possession.\r\nAmerica and England were humiliated.\"[237]\r\n\r\nThe colonies had shown, by their divided and often antagonistic\r\ncounsels, their divided resources and isolated efforts, how unable they\r\nwere to defend themselves even when assisted at some points by English\r\nsoldiers, commanded by unskilful generals, against a strong and united\r\nenemy, directed by generals of consummate skill and courage. The\r\ncolonies despaired of future success, if not of their own existence,\r\nafter incurring so heavy expenditures of men and money, and wished\r\nEngland to assume the whole management and expenses of the war.[238]\r\n\r\nThe colonies had done much for their own defence, but they acted as so\r\nmany petty independent Governments, and could not be brought to combine\r\ntheir resources of men and money in any systematical method, under some\r\ncentral authority as the same colonies did twenty years later in the\r\nAmerican Revolution; and the first proceedings of Abercrombie and\r\nLoudoun rendered them powerless to command the confidence and united\r\naction of the colonies. General Abercrombie was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief, to supersede General Shirley, until the arrival of\r\nthe Earl of Loudoun. Abercrombie landed in New York the 12th of June,\r\nwith two regiments, and forty German officers, who were to raise and\r\ntrain recruits for Loudoun's Royal American regiment of four thousand--a\r\nmost impolitic proceeding, which offended and discouraged the colonists.\r\nOn his arrival at New York he received letters from the shrewd and able\r\nGovernor of Virginia, Dinwiddie, recommending Washington as \"a very able\r\nand deserving gentleman,\" who \"has from the beginning commanded the\r\nforces of this Dominion. He is much beloved, has gone through many\r\nhardships in the service, has great merit, and can raise more men here\r\nthan any one,\" and urged his promotion in the British army. But\r\nWashington's services and rank were never recognized in the British\r\narmy. A week after Abercrombie's arrival in New York, he wrote (June 19,\r\n1756) a letter to Governor Colden: \"I find you never will be able to\r\ncarry on anything to any purpose in America, till you have a viceroy or\r\nsuperintendent over all the provinces.\" He stated that Lord Loudoun's\r\narrival would produce \"a great change in affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe 25th of June Abercrombie arrived at Albany, and forthwith insisted\r\nthat the regular officers should take precedence of the provincial\r\nofficers, and that the troops should be quartered in private houses,\r\nwhich he accomplished two days afterwards; for on the 27th, \"in spite\r\nof every subterfuge, the soldiers were at last billeted upon the town,\"\r\nto the great indignation of the Mayor, who wished all the soldiers back\r\nagain, \"for\" said he, \"we can defend our frontiers ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day after Abercrombie's arrival, Shirley (now relinquishing the\r\noffice of Commander-in-Chief) informed General Abercrombie of the\r\nexposed and unsafe state of Oswego, advising that two battalions be sent\r\nforward for its protection; that 200 boats were ready, and every\r\nmagazine along the passage plentifully supplied. But Abercrombie decided\r\nto wait the arrival of Loudoun, who at length reached Albany the 29th of\r\nJuly, and joined Abercrombie in the policy of hesitation and delay,\r\nthough having 10,000 men at his disposal--the New England regiments,\r\nwith the provincials from New York and New Jersey, amounting to more\r\nthan 7,000 men, besides 3,000 soldiers of British regular regiments.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the French generals were more active and energetic,\r\ntaking places of defence between Albany and Oswego, strengthening the\r\ndefences and garrison of Ticonderaga (then in possession of the French,\r\nand called by them Fort Carillon), making a palisaded camp near the\r\nmouth of Sandy Creek, close to Oswego, and at length attacking Oswego\r\nitself, the enterprising Montcalm making forced marches day and night,\r\nmarching on foot, living and sleeping like his soldiers, and taking the\r\nfort the 9th of August, after a week's siege, capturing 1,600 prisoners,\r\n120 cannon, six vessels of war, 300 boats, stores of ammunition and\r\nprovisions, and three chests of money.\r\n\r\nLoudoun had sufficient forces and time to penetrate to the heart of\r\nCanada, had he possessed the qualities of Montcalm; but he preferred to\r\nplace obstacles to prevent the enemy from attacking him; and after\r\nhaving spent some weeks in busy inactivity at Albany, he dismissed the\r\nprovincials to their homes, and the regulars to winter quarters.[239]\r\n\r\nLoudoun never fought a battle in America; and the only battle in which\r\nAbercrombie commanded he kept out of reach of personal danger, was\r\ndefeated, and retreated[240] after losing 1,942 men, among whom was\r\nGeneral Lord Howe, who had been selected by Pitt to be Commander-in-Chief\r\nin America, had not succeeded to it, but had become a favourite with the\r\narmy and colonists of all classes.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Massachusetts appropriated out of the public\r\ntreasury the sum of £250 for erecting a monument to his memory in\r\nWestminster Abbey, as a testimony to the sense which the Province had of\r\nthe services and military virtues of the late Lord Viscount Howe, who\r\nfell in the last campaign fighting in the cause of the colonies, and\r\nalso to express the affection which their officers and soldiers have to\r\nhis command.\r\n\r\nAfter the disgraceful defeat and still more disgraceful retreat of\r\nAbercrombie, the last of the incompetent English generals, General\r\nAmherst was appointed Commander-in-Chief, assisted by General Wolfe, and\r\nthe fortunes of war turned in favour of England and her colonies, and\r\nthe French power began to wane in America.\r\n\r\nThis change in the colonies from defeat to victory, from disgrace to\r\nhonour, from distrust to confidence, from fear to triumph, was owing to\r\na change of councillors and councils in England, and the rousing of the\r\ncolonies from the shame and defeat of the past to a supreme and combined\r\neffort with the English armies for the expulsion of the French from\r\nAmerica, and the consequent subjugation and alliance of the Indian\r\ntribes, whose hostilities had been all along and everywhere prompted and\r\naided by the French, who paid the Indians large bounties for English\r\nscalps.[241]\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says Hutchinson, \"in the interval between the repulse at\r\nTiconderaga and the arrival of General Amherst, Colonel Bradstreet (a\r\nprovincial officer of New York), with 3,000 provincials and 150\r\nregulars, stole a march upon Montcalm, and before he could send a\r\ndetachment from his army to Lake Ontario by way of the St. Lawrence,\r\nwent up the Mohawk river. About the 25th of August they arrived at Fort\r\nFrontenac; surprised the garrison, who were made prisoners of war; took\r\nand destroyed nine small vessels and much merchandise; but having\r\nintelligence of a large body of the enemy near, they made haste back to\r\nAlbany. The men complained of undergoing greater hardship than they had\r\never undergone before, and many sickened and died from the fatigue of\r\nthe march.\"[242]\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of Lord Amherst, three expeditions were proposed for\r\nthe year 1758--the first against Louisburg, the second against\r\nTiconderaga, and the third against Fort du Quesne--all of which were\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nOn the first expedition against Louisburg, Admiral Boscawen sailed from\r\nHalifax the 28th of May, with a fleet of 20 ships of the line and 18\r\nfrigates, and an army of 14,000 men, under the command of General\r\nAmherst, assisted by General Wolfe, and arrived before Louisburg the 2nd\r\nof June. The garrison was composed of 2,500 regulars, aided by 600\r\nmilitia, commanded by the Chevalier de Drucourt, an officer of courage\r\nand experience. The harbour was secured by five ships of the line, one\r\n50-gun ship, and five frigates; three of which were sunk across the\r\nmouth of the basin. The landing of the troops, artillery, and stores had\r\ntherefore to be effected some distance from the town, and was extremely\r\ndifficult and hazardous; but General Wolfe, who led the 2,000 men\r\ndetached for that purpose, was equal to the occasion, and displayed\r\nqualities which designated him as the future conqueror of Quebec. After\r\nan obstinate siege from the 8th of June to the 26th of July, the\r\nfortress was surrendered at discretion, and the whole of Cape Breton,\r\nincluding St. John Island (since Prince Edward Island), came into\r\npossession of Great Britain. The loss on the part of the English was\r\nabout 400 killed and wounded; the garrison lost upwards of 1,500 men,\r\nand the town was reduced to a heap of ruins. The conquerors took 221\r\npieces of cannon, 16 mortars, and an immense quantity of stores and\r\nammunition, and 5,637 prisoners, including naval officers, sailors, and\r\nmarines.[243]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Boscawen, after taking possession of the Island of St. John,\r\nincluded in the capitulation of Louisburg, sailed with the fleet for\r\nEngland, with General Wolfe, conveying the French prisoners to England,\r\nand the trophies of victory. General Amherst embarked, with about\r\nthirty transports filled with the victorious troops, and encamped on the\r\ncommon at Boston near the end of August, on his march, which he pursued\r\nafter three days' rest, to the western forts; for a part of the plan of\r\noperations was, after the conquest of Cape Breton, for General Amherst,\r\nwith 12,000 men, to destroy the enemy's fort at Ticonderaga (so\r\nunsuccessfully attacked by Abercrombie the year before), in order to\r\nopen a way into Canada by the Lakes George and Champlain, and the River\r\nSorell down to Quebec, the capture of which, by advancing up the St.\r\nLawrence, was assigned to the fleet under Admiral Saunders, and to\r\nGeneral Wolfe, in command of 9,000 men. It was intended that the armies\r\nunder Generals Amherst and Wolfe should meet and join in the taking of\r\nQuebec; but the junction was not effected, and the two armies operated\r\nseparately and successfully. The taking of the fortress of Niagara,\r\nwhich was regarded as \"the throat of the north-western division of the\r\nAmerican continent,\" was assigned to Brigadier-General Prideaux, aided\r\nby Sir William Johnson, who commanded the Provincials and Indians.\r\nGeneral Prideaux conducted the expedition and planned the mode of\r\nattack; but on the 19th of July, while walking in his trenches, he was\r\nkilled by the carelessness of his own gunner in firing a cannon.\r\n\r\n\"Luckily,\" says Hutchinson, \"for Sir William Johnson, who, as next\r\nofficer, took the command on Prideaux's death, a body of 1,200 men from\r\nDetroit, etc., making an attempt, on the 24th of July, to throw\r\nthemselves into the fort as a reinforcement, were intercepted and\r\nkilled, taken, or dispersed, and the next day the garrison capitulated.\"\r\n(History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. III., p. 77.)\r\n\r\nThe expedition against the French Fort du Quesne, on the Ohio river, so\r\nfatal to General Braddock, was entrusted to General Forbes, with\r\nWashington, colonel of the Virginia regulars, as second in command.\r\nForbes, though wasting under the disease of consumption, heroically\r\nsuperintended and endured for three months the difficulties and fatigues\r\nof the same line of march pursued by Braddock three years before,\r\nleaving Philadelphia in command of 8,000 men early in July, but not\r\nreaching Fort du Quesne until late in November. On the evening preceding\r\nhis arrival, the French garrison, deserted by their Indians, abandoned\r\nthe fort, and escaped in boats down the Ohio. Hutchinson says: \"The\r\nexpedition for dispossessing the French of Fort du Quesne, near the\r\nOhio, had at first a very unfavourable prospect. The English forces met\r\nwith a variety of obstructions and discouragements; and when they had\r\nadvanced to within thirty or forty miles of the fort, they were at a\r\nstand deliberating whether they should go forward or not. Receiving\r\nintelligence that the garrison was in a weak condition, they pushed on.\r\nUpon their arrival at the fort they met with no opposition. The enemy\r\nhad deserted it, for want of provisions, as was generally believed; and\r\nit was added that the provisions intended to supply that fort were\r\ndestroyed by Bradstreet at Fort Frontenac.[244] Thus the gallant and\r\nlaborious exploit of Bradstreet in demolishing Fort Frontenac\r\ncontributed to the reduction of Fort du Quesne without firing a shot.\"\r\n\"The English now took possession of that important fortress, and, in\r\ncompliment to the popular Minister, called it Pittsburg. No sooner was\r\nthe English flag erected on it, than the numerous tribes of the Ohio\r\nIndians came in and made their submission to the English. General Forbes\r\nhaving concluded treaties with the natives, left a garrison of\r\nprovincials in the fort and built a block-house near Loyal Hannah, but,\r\nworn out with fatigue, he died before he could reach Philadelphia.\"[245]\r\nIn the same month of July that Sir William Johnson dispossessed the\r\nFrench of Niagara, General Amherst took possession of the enemy's lines\r\nat Ticonderaga, which the French abandoned after having set fire to the\r\nfort. A few days afterwards, in the beginning of August, General Amherst\r\nobtained possession of the fort at Crown Point, it having also been\r\nabandoned by the French. About the middle of the month General Amherst\r\nreceived information at Crown Point that General Bourlamarque was\r\nencamped at Isle aux Noix with 3,500 men and 100 cannon, and that the\r\nFrench had four vessels on the lake under the command of the captain of\r\na man-of-war. He therefore judged it necessary to build a brigantine, a\r\nradeau, and a sloop of 16 guns. Such a fleet could not be got ready\r\nbefore the beginning of October; on the 11th of which month General\r\nAmherst embarked in batteaux, under the convoy of armed vessels, and\r\nproceeded down the lake; but encountering cold and stormy weather and\r\ncontrary winds, he resolved, on the 19th, to return to Crown Point and\r\ngo into winter quarters. No communications could be opened between the\r\narmies of Amherst and Wolfe; but the withdrawal of a great part of the\r\nFrench force from Quebec, to watch and counteract the movements of\r\nGeneral Amherst, doubtless contributed to General Wolfe's success. The\r\nfleet under Sir Charles Saunders, and the army of five thousand men\r\nunder General Wolfe, arrived before Quebec the latter part of June, and\r\nfrom that time to the 13th of September a series of daring but\r\nunsuccessful attempts were made to get possession of the city. How\r\nunyielding perseverance and heroic courage, against apparently\r\ninsurmountable obstacles, effected the capture of that Gibraltar of\r\nAmerica, with the fall of the leaders of both armies in the bloody\r\nstruggle, has often been vividly described and variously illustrated,\r\nwhich I need not here repeat.\r\n\r\nThe British and colonial arms were completely successful this year.[246]\r\nBradstreet destroyed Fort Frontenac; Sir William Johnson captured\r\nNiagara; Forbes, aided by Washington, retook Fort du Quesne, and named\r\nit Pittsburg; Lord Amherst took possession of Ticonderaga and Crown\r\nPoint; and Wolfe became the conqueror of Quebec. In each of these\r\nexpeditions the provincial troops rendered essential service. The\r\nseveral provinces were prompted to put forth their utmost efforts from\r\ntheir impending perils by the successive victories of the French and\r\nIndians the previous year, and encouraged by the appeal of the Prime\r\nMinister, Pitt, who assured them of the strong forces by sea and land\r\nfrom England, and that they would be compensated for the expense they\r\nmight incur.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Massachusetts had for many years been set upon the conquest\r\nof Canada, both for her own security and for the extension of her\r\nnorthern limits, and she had sacrificed much treasure and many lives\r\nfor that purpose, but had failed in each attempt. The taking of Quebec\r\ndid not complete the conquest of Canada. On the fall of that city,\r\nMontreal became the seat of the French Government; the inhabitants of\r\nCanada remained subjects of the King of France; the French military\r\nforces within the province, were still very considerable;[247] and M. de\r\nLevi, who succeeded Montcalm as Commander-in-Chief of the army, made a\r\nvery formidable attempt to recover Quebec.[248] On the reduction of that\r\ncity, the fleet under Sir Charles Saunders returned to England, and\r\nGeneral Murray was left in command at Quebec with a garrison of 5,000\r\nmen, which, during the ensuing winter, owing to the extreme cold, and\r\nthe want of vegetables and fresh provisions, was reduced to 3,000 men\r\nfit for service, when in April M. de Levi, with a superior force,\r\nattacked the city, drove General Murray's little army from the Plains of\r\nAbraham within the walls, and closely besieged the city, which was\r\nrelieved, and M. de Levi compelled to raise the siege, by the opportune\r\narrival of the English fleet.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, General Amherst was energetically pursuing the most\r\neffective measures for the complete extinction of French power in\r\nCanada. At the commencement of the year 1760, he applied to the northern\r\ncolonies for men and means equal to what they had provided for\r\n1759,[249] and during the winter he made arrangements to bring the\r\narmies from Quebec, Lake Champlain, and Lake Ontario, to act against\r\nMontreal. Colonel Haviland, by his orders, sailed early in the spring\r\nwith a detachment from Crown Point, took possession of the Isle aux\r\nNoix, which he found abandoned by the enemy, and proceeded thence to\r\nMontreal; while Lord Amherst, with his own division, consisting of about\r\n10,000 regulars and provincials, left the frontier of New York and\r\nadvanced to Oswego, where he was joined by 1,000 Indians of the Six\r\nNations, under Sir William Johnson. Embarking with his entire army on\r\nLake Ontario, and taking the fort of Isle Royale in his way, he arrived\r\nat Montreal, after a difficult and dangerous passage, on the same day\r\nthat General Murray landed near the place from Quebec. The two generals\r\nmet with no opposition in disembarking their troops; and by a happy\r\nconcurrence in the execution of a well-concerted plan, Colonel Haviland\r\njoined them with his detachment the next day. The strength of these\r\ncombined armies, and the masterly disposition made by the commanders,\r\nconvinced M. de Vaudreuil that resistance would be ineffectual, and he\r\ndemanded a capitulation; and on the 8th of September, 1760, Montreal,\r\nDetroit, Michili-Mackinac, and all other places within the government of\r\nCanada, were surrendered to his Britannic Majesty. The destruction of an\r\narmament ordered out from France in aid of Canada completed the\r\nannihilation of French power on the continent of America.[250]\r\n\r\nBut though the conquest of Canada was thus completed, and the American\r\ncolonies thus secured from the encroachments and dangers which had\r\ndisturbed their peace and caused much sacrifice of life for one hundred\r\nand thirty years, yet the war between England and France was not ended,\r\nand in 1762 Spain joined France in the war against the former; but the\r\nactual scene of the war was chiefly the West Indies, and the series of\r\nnaval and other battles fought there were successive victories on the\r\npart of England. \"The progress of the British conquests, which\r\nthreatened all the distant possessions of the enemy, was arrested by\r\npreliminary articles of peace, which were signed and interchanged at\r\nFontainebleau between the Ministers of Great Britain, France, Spain, and\r\nPortugal, on the 3rd day of November. On the 10th of February, 1763, a\r\ndefinite treaty was signed at Paris, and soon after ratified.\"[251]\r\n\r\nThe joy was general and intense throughout England and North America at\r\nsuch a conclusion of a seven years' open war, preceded by several years\r\nof hostile and bloody encroachments on the settlements of the English\r\nprovinces by the French and Indians. It was a war prompted and commenced\r\nby the colonies, and in which their very existence as well as liberties\r\nwere involved. No one of the American colonies had a deeper, if as deep\r\na stake in the results of this protracted struggle as the province of\r\nMassachusetts; no one had more suppliantly and importunately solicited\r\nthe aid of money and men from England; and no colony had benefitted so\r\nlargely in its commerce and resources during the successive years of the\r\ncontest, as Massachusetts. As early as 1755 (the year before war was\r\nformally declared between England and France), the Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts adopted an address to the King, in which, after referring\r\nto their large expenditure in their unsuccessful expedition against\r\nCrown Point, they stated their services and prayed to be relieved from\r\nthe burden incurred by means of them. They pleaded the precedent of the\r\nCape Breton invasion (for expenses incurred in which, in 1745, the\r\nBritish Parliament had granted them compensation), and prayed that his\r\nMajesty would give orders for the support of such forts and garrisons as\r\nthey hoped to establish, and aid them in the further execution of their\r\ndesigns. And in another address, adopted in October of the same year,\r\nthe Massachusetts Court said that the design of securing his Majesty's\r\nterritories against the invasions of the French was what his Majesty\r\nalone was equal to project and execute, and the nation to support; and\r\nthat unless they could obtain the relief which they were soliciting from\r\nthe royal bounty, they should be so far from being able to remove\r\nencroachments that they would be unable to defend themselves.[252]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts having succeeded, with the other colonies, to \"drag,\" as\r\nMr. Bancroft expresses it, \"England into a war with France,\" was thus\r\nimportunate in soliciting aid and compensation from England for her\r\nself-originated expenses, and was so successful in her applications as\r\nto make the war a pecuniary benefit as well as a means of securing and\r\nenlarging her boundaries; for, in the words of the historian quoted\r\nabove, in a previous page, \"The generous compensations which had been\r\nmade every year by Parliament not only alleviated the burden of taxes,\r\nwhich otherwise would have been heavy, but, by the importation of such\r\nlarge sums of specie, increased commerce; and it was the opinion of some\r\nthat the war added to the wealth of the province, though the\r\ncompensation did not amount to half the charges of the government.\"[253]\r\n\r\nThe monies raised by the colonies were expended in them and upon their\r\nown citizens--monies passing from hand to hand, and for provisions\r\nprovided and works done in the colonies; but the large sums appropriated\r\nby Parliament for the war in the colonies was so much money abstracted\r\nfrom England, sent across the Atlantic, and added to the resources and\r\nwealth of the colonies.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the war, in 1763, Massachusetts acknowledged her\r\nobligations to England for her protection and safety. In an address of\r\nboth Houses of her Legislature to the Governor that year, they\r\nacknowledge that \"the evident design of the French to surround the\r\ncolonies was the immediate and just cause of the war; that without the\r\nprotection afforded them during the war, they must have been a prey to\r\nthe power of France; that without the compensation made them by\r\nParliament, the burden of the expense of the war must have been\r\ninsupportable.\" In their address to the King they make the same\r\nacknowledgments, and at the conclusion promise to evidence their\r\ngratitude by every expression of duty and loyalty in their power.[254]\r\n\r\nMr. Otis, afterwards the most eloquent agitator against England, and\r\nadvocate of independence, at the first town meeting of Boston after the\r\npeace, having been chosen chairman, addressed the inhabitants in the\r\nfollowing words, which he caused to be printed in the newspapers:\r\n\r\n\"We in America have certainly abundant reasons to rejoice. The heathen\r\nare not only driven out, but the Canadians, much more formidable\r\nenemies, are conquered and become our fellow-subjects. The British\r\ndominion and power may be said literally to extend from sea to sea, and\r\nfrom the great river to the ends of the earth. And we may safely\r\nconclude, from his Majesty's wise administration hitherto, that liberty\r\nand knowledge, civil and religious, will be co-extended, improved, and\r\npreserved to the latest posterity. No other constitution of civil\r\ngovernment has yet appeared in the world so admirably adapted to these\r\ngreat purposes as that of Great Britain. Every British subject in\r\nAmerica is of common right, by Act of Parliament, and by the laws of God\r\nand nature, entitled to all the essential privileges of Britons. By\r\nparticular Charters, there are peculiar privileges granted, as in\r\njustice they might and ought, in consideration of the arduous\r\nundertaking to begin so glorious an empire as British America is rising\r\nto. Those jealousies that some weak and wicked minds have endeavoured to\r\ninfuse with regard to the colonies, had their birth in the blackness of\r\ndarkness, and it is a great pity they had not remained there for ever.\r\nThe true interests of Great Britain and her plantations are mutual; and\r\nwhat God in His providence has united, let no man dare attempt to pull\r\nasunder.\"[255]\r\n\r\nSuch were the official acknowledgments and professed feelings of\r\nMassachusetts herself in regard to the conduct of England towards her at\r\nthe close of the seven years' war with France, which was ratified by the\r\nPeace of Paris, 1763, and which secured the American colonies from the\r\nhostilities of the French and their Indian allies for more than a\r\nhundred years. The language of Massachusetts was but the language of all\r\nthe American colonies in regard to Great Britain at this period--the\r\nlanguage of gratitude and affection.\r\n\r\nDown, therefore, to within thirteen years of the American Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the conduct of England to her American colonies is\r\nacknowledged upon the highest authority to have been just and generous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: \"The French, upon recovering Louisburg, had laid the\r\nscheme (the particulars of which shall be exhibited in their due place)\r\nfor engrossing the whole empire of North America, and in a manner for\r\nextirpating the English interest there. Notice of this was, soon after\r\nthe peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, given to the English Government by their\r\nGovernors in America, and proper instructions were dispatched to them to\r\nresist all encroachments attempted to be made upon the English\r\nterritories. The Earl of Albemarle (British Ambassador in Paris) had\r\norders from his Court to remonstrate on this occasion; but his\r\nremonstrances had so little effect that the French seemed rather\r\nencouraged in than deterred from their usurpations. The English\r\nGovernors in America daily sent over complaints of the French\r\nencroachments there, which were too little regarded, in hopes of matters\r\nbeing compromised.\" (Rapin's History of England, Vol. XXI., p. 418.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: \"But their encroachments went further (than Nova Scotia),\r\nand this year (1754) they began to make settlements upon the River Ohio,\r\nwithin the limits of the British possessions in the western parts of\r\nVirginia. They had likewise committed many hostilities against British\r\nsubjects in other parts of America.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the while the French were multiplying their hostilities and\r\nstrengthening their usurpations by new recruits of men, money,\r\nprovisions of all kinds, and ammunition, and some of the best officers\r\nin France.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the Government of England complained to the French Court of those\r\nencroachments, the Ministry gave evasive answers, and promised that\r\neverything should be amicably adjusted; but without desisting from their\r\nusurpations, which became every day more and more intolerable. The\r\nEnglish, perceiving this, sent general orders to all their Governors in\r\nAmerica to repel force by force, and to drive them from all the\r\nsettlements which they had made contrary to the faith of treaties, and\r\nespecially along the Ohio.\" (Rapin's History of England, Vol. XXI., pp.\r\n478-491.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: \"They had been incessantly making settlements upon the\r\nEnglish property since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and at last they\r\nmade a settlement on the western part of Virginia, upon the River Ohio.\r\nMr. Dinwiddie (Governor of Virginia) having intelligence of this, sent\r\nan officer, Major Washington, with a letter to the French commandant\r\nthere, requiring him to desist, and with orders, if possible, to bring\r\nthe Indians over to the British interest. Washington had but indifferent\r\nsuccess with the Indians; and when he arrived with some of the Indians\r\nat the French settlements, he found the French by no means inclined to\r\ngive over their undertaking, and that the Indians, notwithstanding all\r\ntheir fair promises, were much more in their interest than in that of\r\nEngland. Upon further inquiry it was found that the Indians called the\r\nSix Nations, who, by the treaty of Utrecht, were acknowledged to be\r\nsubject to Great Britain, had been entirely debauched by the French, who\r\nhad likewise found means to bring over to their interest those vast\r\ntracts that lie along the great lakes and rivers to the west of the\r\nApalachian (or Allegany) mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus got the friendship of those Indians, they next contrived\r\nhow they could cut them off from all communication with the English, and\r\nfor that purpose they seized the persons and effects of all the English\r\nwhom they found trading with the Indians; and they erected a chain of\r\nforts from Canada to Mississippi, to prevent all future communication\r\nbetween the English and those Indians; at the same time destroying such\r\nof the Indians as discovered any affection or regard for the British\r\nsubjects: so that in a very few years all the eastern as well as the\r\nwestern colonies of Great Britain were in danger of being\r\nruined.\"--_Ib._, pp. 290, 291.\r\n\r\n\"Though the several provinces belonging to Great Britain, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the French encroachments, raised both men and money\r\nagainst them, yet the forms of their legal proceedings in their\r\nassemblies were so dilatory that the French always had the start of\r\nthem, and they surprised a place called Log's Town, belonging to the\r\nVirginians, on the Ohio. This was a place of great importance, and the\r\nFrench made themselves masters of the block-house and the truck-house,\r\nwith skins and other commodities to the amount of £20,000, besides\r\ncutting off all the English traders in those parts but two, who found\r\nmeans to escape. About the same time, near 1,000 French, under the\r\ncommand of Monsieur de Carstrecoeur, and 18 pieces of cannon, came in\r\n300 canoes from Venango, a fort that they had usurped upon the banks of\r\nthe Ohio, and surprised an English fort on the forks of the\r\nMonongahella. After this, a great many skirmishes happened between the\r\nEnglish and the French with various success.\r\n\r\n\"In the meanwhile, orders came from England to the Governors of the\r\nBritish settlements in America to form a kind of political confederacy,\r\nto which every province was to contribute a quota. Though the scheme of\r\npolitical confederacy was the best measure that could be pursued in the\r\nsituation of the British settlements, yet it had not all the effect that\r\nwas expected from it.\" (Rapin's History of England, Vol. XXI., pp. 491,\r\n492.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: Rapin's History of England, Vol. XXI., pp. 520, 521.\r\nRapin adds:--\"While all Europe was in suspense about the fate of the\r\nEnglish and French squadrons, the preparations for a vigorous sea war\r\nwere going on in England with unparalleled spirit and success.\r\nNotwithstanding, the French Court still flattered itself that Great\r\nBritain, out of tenderness to his Majesty's German dominions, would\r\nabstain from hostilities. Mirepoix (the French Ambassador at London)\r\ncontinued to have frequent conferences with the British Ministry, who\r\nmade no secret that their admirals, particularly Boscawen, had orders to\r\nattack the French ships wherever they should meet them; on the other\r\nhand, Mons. de Mirepoix declared that his master would consider the\r\nfirst gun fired at sea, in a hostile manner, as a declaration of war.\r\nThis menace, far from intimidating the English, animated them to\r\nredouble their preparations for war.\"--_Ib._, p. 521.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: Rapin, Vol. XXI., p. 521. It was during this interval\r\nthat the unfortunate expedition, death, and defeat of General Braddock\r\ntook place, on the banks of the Ohio river, at Fort du Quesne,\r\nafterwards called Pittsburg. \"The naval expedition, under Admiral\r\nBoscawen, was somewhat more fortunate (than that of Braddock), though\r\nfar from answering the expectations of the public. He made a prosperous\r\nvoyage till he came to the banks of Newfoundland, where his rendezvous\r\nwas; and in a few days the French fleet, under De la Mothe, came to the\r\nsame station. But the thick fogs which prevail on those coasts,\r\nespecially at that time of the year, kept the two squadrons from seeing\r\none another; and part of the French squadron escaped up the River St.\r\nLawrence, while some of them went round and got into the same river by\r\nthe Straits of Belleisle, by a way which had never been attempted before\r\nby ships of war. While Boscawen's fleet, however, lay before Cape Race,\r\non the banks of Newfoundland, which was thought to be the proper station\r\nfor intercepting the enemy, two French ships--the _Alcide_, of 60 guns\r\nand 480 men; and the _Lys_, pierced for 64 guns, but mounting only 22,\r\nand having eight companies of land forces on board--fell in with the\r\n_Dunkirk_, Captain Howe, and the _Defiance_, Captain Andrews, two 60-gun\r\nships of the English squadron, and were, both of them, after a smart\r\nengagement, in which Captain (afterwards Lord) Howe behaved with the\r\ngreatest skill and intrepidity, taken, with about £8,000 on board.\r\nThough this action was far from answering the grand destination of the\r\nfleet, yet when the news reached England it was of infinite service to\r\nthe public credit of every kind; as the manner in which it was conducted\r\nwas a plain proof that the English Government was resolved to observe no\r\nfurther measures with the French, but to take or destroy their ships\r\nwherever they could be met with.\"--_Ib._, pp. 525, 526.\r\n\r\nYet, in the face of these facts, that the French Government had been\r\nencroaching upon the colonies for six years--ever since the treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle; had been transporting soldiers and all the munitions of\r\nwar to America to exterminate the English colonies; had put to death\r\nBritish subjects; and that complaints of these outrages had been made to\r\nEngland year after year by the Governors and representatives of the\r\nColonies, and that the French Government had at this time, by fair words\r\nand false pretences, deceived the Government of England, which had\r\nwarned the French Government that the English admirals had orders to\r\nattack and take all the French ships, public and private, that should be\r\nmet with at sea; yet, in the face of such facts, Mr. Bancroft, with his\r\nhabitual hostility to England and endless perversions of historical\r\nfacts, says in 1755: \"France and England were still at peace, and their\r\ncommerce was mutually protected by the sanctity of treaties. _Of a\r\nsudden_, hostile orders were issued to all British vessels of war to\r\ntake all French vessels, private as well as public,\" and \"eight thousand\r\nFrench seamen were held in captivity. All France resented the perfidy.\r\n'Never,' said Louis the Fifteenth, 'will I forgive the piracies of this\r\ninsolent nation.' And in a letter to George the Second he demanded ample\r\nreparation for the insult to the flag of France by Boscawen, and for the\r\npiracies of the English men-of-war, committed in defiance of\r\ninternational law, the faith of treaties, the usages of civilized\r\nnations, and the reciprocal duties of kings.\" (History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. IV., pp. 217, 218.)\r\n\r\nAmong the eight thousand French seamen held in captivity were the\r\nsoldiers destined for America, to invade the British colonies in time of\r\nprotracted peace and against \"the faith of treaties.\" Mr. Bancroft also\r\nignores the fact that a year before this the Commissioners from the\r\nLegislative Assemblies of the several colonies, assembled at Albany, had\r\nrepresented to the British Government the alarming encroachments of the\r\nFrench, and imploring aid, and that the French authorities in America\r\nhad offered the Indians bounties on English scalps.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. III., pp.\r\n21-23.\r\n\r\n\"While the Convention was sitting, and attending principally to the\r\nfrontiers of the colonies, in the western parts, Mr. Shirly (Governor of\r\nMassachusetts) was diligently employed in the east, prosecuting a plan\r\nfor securing the frontiers of Massachusetts Bay.\"--_Ib._, p. 25.\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of this year (1755) the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nin New England, passed an Act prohibiting all correspondence with the\r\nFrench at Louisburg; and early in the spring they raised a body of\r\ntroops, which was transported to Nova Scotia, to assist\r\nLieutenant-Governor Lawrence in driving the French from the\r\nencroachments they had made upon that province.\" (Hume and Smollett's\r\nHistory of England, Vol. VII., p. 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: History of the United States, Vol. IV., pp. 276, 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: Minot's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 228.\r\nDr. Minot adds: \"The whole number assigned for this expedition against\r\nCrown Point was 3,700, of which Massachusetts voted to raise 1,560,\r\nbesides 500 by way of reinforcement, if judged necessary by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, with the advice of the Council; and to these 300\r\nmore were added after the defeat of General Braddock. The General Court\r\nalso voted £600 to be applied towards engaging the Indians of the Six\r\nNations in the enterprise, and supporting their families. In short, this\r\nbecame a favourite enterprise both with the General Court and the people\r\nof Massachusetts Bay, not only because it originated with them, but\r\nbecause it was directed against a quarter (considering the French in\r\nNova Scotia were subdued and dispersed) whence they had the most to\r\nfear.\"--_Ib._, pp. 229, 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: Before Johnson could attack Crown Point, he was himself\r\nattacked in his own quarters, at what was called Carrying Place, near\r\nLake George, by Dieskau, at the head of 200 regular troops, 600\r\nCanadians, and 600 savages. Johnson's force consisted of 3,400\r\nprovincial soldiers and 300 Indians, \"regularly enlisted under the\r\nEnglish flag and paid from the English treasury.\" Among the New England\r\nmen was Israel Putman, of Connecticut, then a private soldier,\r\nafterwards famous. Mr. Bancroft, as might be expected, depreciates the\r\nservices of Sir William Johnson in this important and successful battle.\r\nBut he cannot deny that Johnson selected the most advantageous position\r\nfor his camp; sent out scouts on all sides, and obtained timely\r\ninformation of the approach of the enemy, and was fully prepared for it;\r\ndirected the order of battle, in the early part of which he was wounded,\r\ncausing his removal from the field, when for five hours the provincial\r\nsoldiers, good marksmen, under their own officers, \"kept up the most\r\nviolent fire that had yet been known in America.\" The House of Lords, in\r\nan address to the King, praised the colonists as \"brave and faithful,\"\r\nand Johnson was honoured with a title and money. \"But,\" says Mr.\r\nBancroft, \"he did little to gain the victory, which was due to the\r\nenthusiasm of the New England men. 'Our all,' they cried, 'depends on\r\nthe success of this expedition.' 'Come,' said Pomeroy, of Massachusetts,\r\nto his friends at home, 'Come to the help of the Lord against the\r\nmighty; you that value our holy religion and our liberties will spare\r\nnothing, even to the one-half of your estate.' And in all the villages\r\n'the prayers of God's people' went up that 'they might be crowned with\r\nvictory, to the glory of God;' _for the war with France seemed a war for\r\nProtestantism and freedom_.\" (History of the United States, Vol. IV., p.\r\n212.) Dr. Minot justly observes: \"Such a successful defence made by the\r\nforces of the British colonists against a respectable army, with which\r\nthe regular troops of France were incorporated, was an honourable\r\ninstance of firmness, deliberation, and spirit.\" (History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 254.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: Hume and Smollett's History of England, Vol. XII., p. 25.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" says Minot, \"ended the transactions of the year 1755--'a year,'\r\nsays a well-informed writer of that time, 'never to be forgotten in\r\nAmerica.' It opened with the fairest prospects to these distant\r\npossessions of the British empire. Four armies were on foot to remove\r\nthe encroachments of a perfidious neighbour, and our coasts honoured\r\nwith a fleet for their security, under the command of the brave and\r\nvigilant Boscawen. We had everything to hope--nothing to fear. The enemy\r\nwas dispersed; and we only desired a proclamation of war for the final\r\ndestruction of the whole country of New France. But how unlooked-for was\r\nthe event! General Winslow (great-grandson of Edward Winslow, one of the\r\npatriarchs of the Plymouth Colony), indeed succeeded in Nova Scotia; but\r\nBraddock was defeated; Niagara and Crown Point remained unreduced; the\r\nsavages were let loose from the wilderness; many thousand farms were\r\nabandoned; the King's subjects inhumanly butchered or reduced to\r\nbeggary. To all which might be added an impoverishment of finances to a\r\ndesperate state, the Crown Point expedition having cost, on the part of\r\nMassachusetts Bay alone, £76,618 8s. 9-1/2d., besides unliquidated\r\naccounts to a large amount for the charge of the sick and wounded, the\r\ngarrisons at the two forts of William Henry and Edward, and the great\r\nstock of provisions laid in for their support.\" (History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 259-261.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: \"Mr. Fox, on the 28th of January, presented to the House\r\nof Commons a message from the King, desiring them to take into\r\nconsideration the faithful services of the people of New England and\r\nsome other parts of North America; upon which £115,000 were voted, and\r\n£5,000 as a reward to Sir William Johnson in particular.\" (Hume and\r\nSmollett's History of England, Vol. XII., p. 42.)\r\n\r\n\"The sum granted by Parliament was £115,000 sterling, which was\r\napportioned in the following manner: Massachusetts Bay,£54,000;\r\nConnecticut, £26,000; New York, £15,000; New Hampshire, £8,000; Rhode\r\nIsland, £7,000; New Jersey, £5,000. This money arriving in New York with\r\nthe troops from England, enabled the Government (of Massachusetts) to\r\npay off by anticipation the sums borrowed of the Commander-in-Chief, and\r\nto replenish the public treasury. They had also the satisfaction to find\r\nthat the Province had not only anticipated the King's expectations in\r\nraising men, but had furnished them with provisions, which he had\r\nordered to be found at the national expense.\" (Minot's History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 288.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: \"The loss of the two small forts, called Ontario and\r\nOswego, was a considerable national misfortune. They were erected on the\r\nsouth side of the great Lake Ontario, standing on the opposite sides, at\r\nthe mouth of Onondaga river, that discharges itself into the lake, and\r\nconstituted a port of great importance, where vessels had been built to\r\ncruise upon the lake, which is a kind of inland sea, and interrupt the\r\ncommerce as well as the motions and designs of the enemy. The garrison\r\nconsisted of 1,400 men, chiefly militia and new-raised recruits, under\r\nthe command of Lieutenant-Colonel Mercer, an officer of courage and\r\nexperience; but the situation of the forts was very ill-chosen; the\r\nmaterials mostly timber or logs of wood; the defences wretchedly\r\ncontrived and unfurnished; and, in a word, the place altogether\r\nuntenable against any regular approach. Such were the forts which the\r\nenemy wisely resolved to reduce. They assembled a body of troops,\r\nconsisting of 1,300 regulars, 1,700 Canadians, and a considerable number\r\nof Indian auxiliaries, under the command of the Marquis de Montcalm, a\r\nvigilant and enterprising officer, to whom the conduct of the siege had\r\nbeen entrusted by the Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor and\r\nLieutenant-General of New France. The garrison having fired away all\r\ntheir shells and ammunition from Fort Ontario, spiked up the cannon,\r\nand, deserting the fort, retired next day across the river into Fort\r\nOswego, which was even more exposed than the other, especially when the\r\nenemy had taken possession of Fort Ontario, from whence they immediately\r\nbegan to fire without intermission. Colonel Mercer being on the 13th\r\nkilled by a cannon ball, the fort destitute of all cover, the officers\r\ndivided in opinion and the garrison in confusion, they next day demanded\r\ncapitulation, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war, on condition\r\nthat they should be exempted from plunder, conducted to Montreal, and\r\ntreated with humanity. These conditions, however, the Marquis did not\r\npunctually observe. The British officers were insulted by the savage\r\nIndians, who robbed them of their clothes and baggage, massacred several\r\nof them as they stood defenceless on parade, and barbarously scalped all\r\nthe sick people in the hospital. Finally, Montcalm, in direct violation\r\nof the articles as well as in contempt of common humanity, delivered up\r\nabove twenty men of the garrison to the Indians in lieu of the same\r\nnumber they had lost during the siege; and in all probability these\r\nmiserable captives were put to death by those barbarians, with the most\r\nexcruciating tortures, according to the execrable custom of the country.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners taken at Oswego, after having been thus barbarously\r\ntreated, were conveyed in batteaux to Montreal, where they had no reason\r\nto complain of their reception; and before the end of the year they were\r\nexchanged. The victors immediately demolished the two forts (if they\r\ndeserved that denomination), in which they found one hundred and\r\ntwenty-one pieces of artillery, fourteen mortars, with a great quantity\r\nof ammunition, warlike stores and provisions, besides two ships and two\r\nhundred batteaux, which likewise fell into their hands.\" (Hume and\r\nSmollett's History of England, Vol. XII., pp. 92-94.)\r\n\r\n\"The policy of the French was no less conspicuous than the superiority\r\nof their arms. Instead of continuing the fort at Oswego, they demolished\r\nit in presence of the Indians of the Five Nations, to whom they\r\nrepresented that the French aimed only at enabling them to preserve\r\ntheir neutrality, and therefore destroyed the fortress which the English\r\nhad erected in their country to overawe them, disdaining themselves to\r\ntake the same advantage, although put in their hands by the right of\r\nconquest.\" (Minot's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 285,\r\n286.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Fort William Henry was situated on the southern coast of\r\nLake George, and was built with a view to protect the frontiers of the\r\nEnglish colonies--especially New York and Massachusetts. The\r\nfortifications were good, defended by a garrison of three thousand men,\r\nand covered by an army of four thousand, under the command of General\r\nWebb, posted at no great distance at Fort Edward. The Marquis de\r\nMontcalm had, early in the season, made three different attacks upon\r\nFort William Henry, in each of which he was repulsed by the resolute and\r\ncourageous garrison. But Montcalm at length assembled all his forces\r\nfrom Crown Point, Ticonderaga, and other parts, amounting to nearly\r\n10,000, including a considerable body of Canadians and Indians; attacked\r\nand invested the fort, which sustained the siege from the 3rd to the 9th\r\nof August, when, having burst most of their cannon, and expended their\r\nown ammunition, and receiving no relief or assistance from General Webb,\r\nat Fort Edward, fourteen miles distant, with 4,000 men, Col. Monro\r\nsurrendered upon the conditions that the garrison should march out with\r\narms, the baggage of the officers and men, and all the usual necessaries\r\nof war, escorted by a detachment of French troops to Fort Edward, and\r\ninterpreters attached to the savages. But, as in the case of the\r\nsurrender of Oswego, the articles of capitulation were not observed, but\r\nwere perfidiously broken; the savages fell upon the British troops as\r\nthey were marched out, despoiled them of their few remaining effects,\r\ndragged the Indians in the English service out of their ranks, and\r\nassassinated them under circumstances of unheard-of barbarity. Some\r\nsoldiers with their wives and children are said to have been savagely\r\nmurdered by these brutal Indians. The greater part of the garrison,\r\nhowever, arrived at Fort Edward under the protection of the French\r\nescort. The enemy demolished the fort, carried off the effects,\r\nprovisions, and everything else left by the garrison, together with the\r\nvessels preserved in the lake, and departed without pursuing their\r\nsuccess by any other attempt. \"Thus ended,\" continues the historian,\r\n\"the third campaign in America (1757), where, with an evident\r\nsuperiority over the enemy, an army of 20,000 regular troops, a great\r\nnumber of provincial forces, and a prodigious naval power--not less than\r\ntwenty ships of the line--we abandoned our allies, exposed our people,\r\nsuffered them to be cruelly massacred in sight of our troops, and\r\nrelinquished a large and valuable tract of country, to the eternal\r\nreproach and disgrace of the British name.\" (Hume and Smollett's History\r\nof England, Vol. XII., pp. 207-211.)\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth remarks: \"In America, after three campaigns, and\r\nextraordinary efforts on the part of the English, the French still held\r\npossession of almost all the territory in dispute. They had been\r\nexpelled indeed from the Bay of Fundy, but they held Louisburg,\r\ncommanding the entrance to the St. Lawrence, Crown Point, and\r\nTiconderaga, on Lake Champlain; Frontenac and Niagara, on Lake Ontario;\r\nPresque Isle, on Lake Erie; and the chains of forts thence to the head\r\nof the Ohio were still in their hands. They had expelled the English\r\nfrom their ancient fort at Oswego, had driven them from Lake George, and\r\ncompelled the Six Nations to a treaty of neutrality. A devastating\r\nIndian war was raging along the whole north-western frontier of the\r\nBritish colonies, and Indian scalping parties penetrated into the very\r\ncentre of Massachusetts, approached within a short distance of\r\nPhiladelphia, and kept Maryland and Virginia in constant alarm.\"\r\n(History of the United States, Vol. II., p. 479.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: \"The Massachusetts General Court had provided barracks at\r\nthe castle for such British troops as might be sent to the province. But\r\nsome officers (from Nova Scotia) on a recruiting service, finding the\r\ndistance (three miles) inconvenient, demanded to be quartered in the\r\ntown. They insisted on the provisions of the Mutiny Act; but the\r\nmagistrates to whom they applied denied that Act to be in force in the\r\ncolonies. Loudoun warmly espoused the cause of his officers; he declared\r\n'that in time of war the rules and customs must go, and threatened to\r\nsend troops to Boston to enforce the demand if not granted within 48\r\nhours. To avoid this extremity, the General Court passed a law of their\r\nown, enacting some of the principal provisions of the Mutiny Act; and\r\nLoudoun, through Governor Pownall's persuasions, consented to accept\r\nthis partial concession. The General Court did not deny the power of\r\nParliament to quarter troops in America. Their ground was, that the Act,\r\nin its terms, did not extend to the colonies. A similar dispute occurred\r\nin South Carolina, where great difficulty was encountered in finding\r\nwinter quarters for the Royal Americans.\" (Hildreth's History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. II., pp. 476, 477.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Bancroft's History, Vol. IV., p. 267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: \"As the General Court of Massachusetts Bay had been\r\nforemost in promoting the Crown Point expedition, and become\r\nproportionally exhausted of money, so they lost no time in making such\r\nuse of the success of the troops in beating off the French as their\r\nnecessities dictated. They drew up an address to his Majesty, in which\r\nthey stated their services, and prayed to be relieved from the burden\r\nincurred by means of them. They pleaded the precedent of the Cape Breton\r\nexpedition (for the expenses of which Parliament had compensated them),\r\nand prayed that his Majesty would give orders for the support of such\r\nforts and garrisons as they hoped to establish, and aid them in the\r\nfurther execution of their designs.\r\n\r\n\"When the Commander-in-Chief urged upon them to join in the plan of the\r\nAssembly of New Jersey, who proposed a meeting of Commissioners from all\r\nhis Majesty's colonies at New York, to consult what might further be\r\ndone for the security of his Majesty's territories against the invasion\r\nof the French, the same impoverishment constrained the General Court to\r\nreply, that the design of securing those territories was what his\r\nMajesty alone was equal to project and execute and the nation to\r\nsupport, and that unless they could obtain the relief which they were\r\nsoliciting of the royal bounty, they should be as far from being able to\r\nremove encroachments as to be unable to defend themselves.\" (Minot's\r\nHistory of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., pp. 256, 257.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: A thousand of the regulars were sent to New York, where\r\nfree quarters for the officers were demanded of the city. Upon its being\r\nobjected to by the authorities of the city, as contrary to the laws of\r\nEngland and the liberties of America, the Viceroy, Loudoun, replied to\r\nthe Mayor with an oath, \"If you do not billet my officers upon free\r\nquarters this day, I'll order here all the troops in North America under\r\nmy command, and billet them myself upon the city.\" \"So,\" says Bancroft,\r\n\"the magistrates got up a subscription, and the officers, who had done\r\nnothing for the country but waste its resources, were supported at free\r\nquarters during the winter.\"\r\n\r\nThe same threats were used, with the same results, to the magistrates of\r\nBoston and Philadelphia, to obtain free quarters for the officers.\r\n\r\nBancroft remarks somewhat bitterly: \"The arbitrary invasion of private\r\nrights and the sanctity of domestic life by the illegal and usurped\r\nauthority of a military chief, was the great result of the campaign. The\r\nfrontiers had been left open to the French; but the tempting example had\r\nbeen given, so dangerous in times of peace, of quartering troops in the\r\nprincipal towns, at the expense of the inhabitants,\" (History of United\r\nStates, Vol. IV., pp. 240, 241.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: The army consisted of between nine and ten thousand\r\nprovincials--seven thousand raised by Massachusetts--and between six and\r\nseven thousand regulars and rangers in the King's pay, where Abercrombie\r\nin person was in command. Lord Howe arrived in Boston from England after\r\nthe forces had left the Province, and immediately upon his landing began\r\nhis journey, and joined the army before any action took place.\r\n\r\n\"This body, the greatest which had ever assembled in arms in America\r\nsince it was settled by the English, embarked on Lake George the 5th of\r\nJuly, for the French fortress at Ticonderaga (called Carillon by the\r\nFrench), and arrived next day at a cove and landing-place, from whence a\r\nway led to the advance guard of the enemy. Seven thousand men, in four\r\ncolumns, then began a march through a thick wood. The columns were\r\nnecessarily broken; their guides were unskilful; the men were bewildered\r\nand lost; and parties fell in one upon another. Lord Howe, the life of\r\nthe army, at the head of a column, which was supported by light\r\ninfantry, being advanced, fell in with a party of the enemy, consisting\r\nof about four hundred regulars and some Indians. Many of them were\r\nkilled, and one hundred and forty-eight taken prisoners. This, however,\r\nwas a dearly purchased victory, for Lord Howe was the first who fell on\r\nthe English side. The report of his death caused consternation as well\r\nas grief through the army, which had placed much confidence in him.\r\n\r\n\"About five hundred regulars were killed upon the spot, and about one\r\nthousand two hundred wounded. Of the provincials, one hundred were\r\nkilled, and two hundred and fifty wounded.\r\n\r\n\"The army still consisted of thirteen or fourteen thousand. The enemy\r\nwas much inferior in number. The retreat, nevertheless, was precipitate.\r\nEarly in the morning of the 9th the whole army embarked in their boats,\r\nand arrived at the other end of the lake in the evening (no enemy\r\npursuing). Provisions, entrenching tools, and many stores of various\r\nkinds, fell into the hands of the enemy. The English arms have rarely\r\nsuffered greater disgrace.\r\n\r\n\"The ill success of General Abercrombie at Ticonderaga caused his\r\nrecall. He seemed to expect and desire it. He was succeeded by General\r\nAmherst.\" (Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. III., pp.\r\n70-75.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: \"The successes of the French the last year (1757) left\r\nthe colonies in a gloomy state. By the acquisition of Fort William\r\nHenry, they obtained full possession of the Lakes Champlain and George;\r\nand by the destruction of Oswego, they had acquired the dominion of\r\nthose other lakes which connect the St. Lawrence with the Mississippi.\r\nThe first afforded the easiest admission from the northern colonies into\r\nCanada, or from Canada into those colonies; the last united Canada to\r\nLouisiana. By the continual possession of Fort du Quesne, they preserved\r\ntheir ascendency over the Indians, and held undisturbed possession of\r\nall the country west of the Allegany mountains.\r\n\r\n\"In this adverse state of things, the spirit of Britain rose in full\r\nproportion to the occasion; and her colonies, instead of yielding to\r\ndespondency, resumed fresh courage, and cheerfully made the preparations\r\nfor the coming campaign. Mr. Pitt had, the last autumn, been placed at\r\nthe head of a new Administration, which conciliated the contending\r\ninterests in Parliament; and while the wisdom of that extraordinary\r\nstatesman devised great and judicious plans, his active spirit infused\r\nnew life into all, whether at home or abroad, whose province it was to\r\nexecute them. In a circular to the Colonial Governors, he assured them\r\nof the determination to send a large force to America, to operate by sea\r\nand land against the French; and called upon them to raise as large\r\nbodies of men as the number of the inhabitants would allow. The northern\r\ncolonies were prompt and liberal in furnishing requisite supplies. The\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts voted to furnish 7,000 men; Connecticut,\r\n5,000; New Hampshire, 3,000. These troops were ready to take the field\r\nvery early in May, previous to which time Admiral Boscawen had arrived\r\nin Halifax with a formidable fleet, and about 12,000 British troops\r\nunder the command of General Amherst. The Earl of Loudoun had returned\r\nto England, and General Abercrombie, on whom the chief command of the\r\nentire forces of the American war had devolved (until the arrival of\r\nLord Amherst), was now at the head of 50,000 men, the most powerful army\r\never seen in America.\" (Holmes' Annals of America, Vol. II., pp. 79,\r\n80.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. II., p. 74. Holmes\r\ngives the following account of this brilliant achievement: \"On the\r\nproposition of Col. Bradstreet, for an expedition against Fort\r\nFrontenac, relinquishing for the present his designs against Ticonderaga\r\nand Crown Point, Abercrombie sent that able and gallant officer on this\r\nservice, with a detachment of 3,000 men, chiefly provincials, and two\r\nmortars. Bradstreet having marched to Oswego, embarked on Lake Ontario,\r\nand on the evening of the 25th of August landed within a mile of the\r\nfort. Within two days his batteries were opened within so short a\r\ndistance that almost every shell took effect; and the French commandant,\r\nfinding the place untenable, surrendered at discretion. The Indians\r\nhaving previously deserted, the prisoners were but 110. The captors\r\nfound in the fort 60 pieces of cannon, 16 small mortars, a large number\r\nof small arms, a vast quantity of provisions, military stores and\r\nmerchandise; and nine armed vessels fell into their hands. Col.\r\nBradstreet having destroyed the fort and vessels, and such stores as\r\ncould not be brought off, returned to the main army.\" (Annals, Vol. II.,\r\np. 83.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: \"The extraordinary rejoicings in England at this victory\r\nseemed to revive the honour of the northern British colonies as the\r\nformer conquerors of Cape Breton.

The fall of Crown Point, Ticonderaga, Niagara, and, above all,\r\nthe capture of Quebec, closed the year with universal rejoicing and\r\nwell-founded hope that the toils of war would shortly cease throughout\r\nthe land.\" (Minot's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. II., p. 55.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: \"The main body of the French army, which, after the\r\nbattle of the Plains of Abraham, retired to Montreal, and which still\r\nconsisted of ten battalions of regulars, had been reinforced by 6,000\r\nCanadian militia and a body of Indians. Here the Marquis de Vaudreuil,\r\nGovernor-General of Canada, had fixed his head-quarters and determined\r\nto make his last stand. For this purpose (after the unsuccessful attempt\r\nof M. de Levi to retake Quebec) he called in all his detachments, and\r\ncollected around him the whole force of the colony.\" (Holmes' Annals,\r\nVol. II., pp. 98, 99.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: \"In the month of April, when the Upper St. Lawrence was\r\nso open as to admit of transportation by water, his artillery, military\r\nstores and heavy baggage were embarked at Montreal and fell down the\r\nriver, under convoy of six frigates; and M. de Levi, after a march of\r\nten days, arrived with his army at Point aux Tremble, within a few miles\r\nof Quebec. General Murray, to whom the care of maintaining the English\r\nconquest had been entrusted, had taken every precaution to preserve it,\r\nbut his soldiers had suffered so by the extreme cold of winter, and by\r\nthe want of vegetables and fresh provisions, that instead of 5,000, the\r\noriginal number of the garrison, there were not at this time above 3,000\r\nmen fit for service. With this small but valiant body he resolved to\r\nmeet him in the field; and on the 28th of April marched out to the\r\nHeights of Abraham, where, near Sillery, he attacked the French under M.\r\nde Levi with great impetuosity. He was received with firmness; and after\r\na fierce encounter, finding himself outflanked and in danger of being\r\nsurrounded by superior numbers, he called off his troops and retired\r\ninto the city. In this action the loss of the English was near 1,000\r\nmen, and that of the French still greater. The French general lost no\r\ntime in improving his victory. On the very evening of the battle he\r\nopened trenches before the town; but it was the 11th of May before he\r\ncould mount his batteries and bring his guns to bear upon the\r\nfortifications. By that time General Murray, who had been indefatigable,\r\nhad completed some outworks, and planted so immense an artillery on its\r\nramparts, that the fire was very superior to that of the besiegers, and\r\nin a manner silenced their batteries. A British fleet most opportunely\r\narriving a few days after, M. de Levi immediately raised the siege and\r\nprecipitately retired to Montreal.\" (Holmes' Annals, Vol. II., pp. 98,\r\n99.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: \"General Amherst made application to Massachusetts for\r\nthe same number of men for the service of the next year as they had\r\nraised the last (1759). _The reduction of Canada was still the object.\r\nThis alone was found to be a sufficient stimulus to the Assembly, and\r\nthey needed no other arguments from the Governor. The generous\r\ncompensations which had been every year made by Parliament not only\r\nalleviated the burden of taxes, which otherwise would have been heavy,\r\nbut by the importation of such large sums of specie increased commerce_,\r\nand it was the opinion of some _that the war added to the wealth of the\r\nprovince_, though the compensation did not amount to one-half the\r\ncharges of government.\r\n\r\n\"The Assembly, at the session in January, 1760, first granted a large\r\nbounty to the men in garrison at Louisburg and Nova Scotia, to encourage\r\nthem to continue in the service. A vote was then passed for raising\r\n5,000 men more, upon the same encouragement as those of the last year\r\nhad received. Soon after the Governor received letters from Mr. Pitt\r\nmaking the like requests as had been made by him the last year, and\r\ngiving the same assurance of compensation. At the beginning of the year\r\nthe English interest in Canada was in a precarious state. Quebec had\r\nbeen besieged in the spring, after a battle in which General Murray had\r\nlost a considerable part of his garrison.

The position of England in respect to the other European Powers after\r\nthe Peace of Paris, 1763.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft remarks: \"At the peace of 1763, the fame of England was\r\nexalted throughout Europe above that of all other nations. She had\r\ntriumphed over those whom she called her hereditary enemies, and\r\nretained half a continent as the monument of her victories. Her American\r\ndominions stretched without dispute from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, from the Gulf of Mexico to Hudson's Bay; and in her older\r\npossessions that dominion was rooted firmly in the affections of the\r\ncolonists as in their institutions and laws.\"[256]\r\n\r\nThe envy and fears of Europe were excited at this vast extension of\r\nBritish territory and power, which they regarded as the foundation of\r\nher still more formidable future greatness. \"Her navy, her commerce, and\r\nher manufactures had greatly increased when she held but a part of the\r\ncontinent, and when she was bounded by the formidable powers of France\r\nand Spain. Her probable future greatness, when without a rival, with a\r\ngrowing vent for her manufactures and increasing employment for her\r\nmarine, threatened to destroy that balance of power which European\r\nsovereigns have for a long time endeavoured to preserve. Kings are\r\nrepublicans with respect to each other, and behold with democratic\r\njealousy any one of their order towering above the rest. The\r\naggrandizement of one tends to excite a combination, or at least the\r\nwishes of many, to reduce him to the common level. From motives of this\r\nkind, the naval superiority of Great Britain was received with jealousy\r\nby her neighbours. They were in general disposed to favour any\r\nconvulsion which promised a diminution of her overgrown power.\"[257]\r\n\r\nThis great increase of the naval and territorial power of Great Britain\r\nexcited apprehension at home as well as jealousies abroad. Some of her\r\nown statesmen and philanthropists entertained doubts as to whether the\r\nextent and diversity of her vast territorial acquisitions would add to\r\nthe strength or happiness of the mother country; and the policy of\r\ncentralization and uniformity decided upon, created the discord and\r\nhastened the disintegration which reflective minds had apprehended.\r\n\r\nII. The position of the American Colonies in regard to England and other\r\nnations clearly signalized a system of government which the English\r\nstatesmen of the times failed to appreciate. The maxim of the King was\r\nnot merely to reign, but to rule; and the policy of his Ministers, of\r\nsuccessive Administrations, was to enfeeble what was colonial and to\r\nstrengthen what was imperial; whereas the extension of colonial\r\nterritory had brought a large accession of colonial experience and\r\nintelligence, which required to be entwined around the throne by the\r\nsilken cords of kindness and interest, instead of being bandaged to\r\nEngland by 29 Acts of Parliament, every one of which indicated the loss\r\nof some sacred birthright or privilege of Englishmen and their posterity\r\nas soon as they emigrated from the eastern to the western shores of the\r\nAtlantic. Those who emigrated to or were born in America were no less\r\nEnglishmen than those who remained or were born in England, and were\r\nentitled to all the rights and privileges of Englishmen; among which is\r\nthe election of representatives who make laws and provide means for\r\ntheir government. The original design of colonization by the British\r\nGovernment was doubtless the extension of its power; the design of\r\nEnglish merchants and manufacturers in promoting colonization was\r\nobviously the extension of their trade, and therefore their own\r\nenrichment; while the design of the colonists themselves, in leaving\r\ntheir native land and becoming adventurers and settlers in new\r\ncountries, was as manifestly the improvement of their own condition and\r\nthat of their posterity. As long as the threefold design of these three\r\nparties to colonization harmonized, there could be no cause or occasion\r\nof collision between them, and they would cordially co-operate in\r\nadvancing the one great object of growing national greatness by\r\nenlarging the commerce and dominions of Great Britain. This was the case\r\nin the earlier stages of American colonization. The colonists needed the\r\nnaval and diplomatic protection of England against foreign invasion, and\r\nthe manufactures of England for their own wants and conveniences, while\r\nEngland needed the productions of the colonial forests and waters. The\r\ncolonial trade became a monopoly of England, and its transportation to\r\nand from the colonies was confined to English ships and sailors. Even\r\nmanufactures in the colonies were forbidden, or restricted, as well as\r\ntheir trade with foreign countries, except by way of England; so that\r\nthe colonies became so many trading ports for English merchandise, and\r\nthe American traders were little other than factors of English\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nHowever this system of monopoly and restriction might answer the\r\npurposes of English merchants and manufacturers, might contribute to\r\nbuild up the mercantile navy of England, and even be politic on the part\r\nof Government in colonial infancy, it could not fail ere long to cause\r\nfriction with the colonies, and was utterly unsuitable to their\r\ncircumstances as they advanced to manhood.[258] As the colonies\r\nincreased in wealth and population, their commerce increased with each\r\nother and with the mother country, and overflowed to the French and\r\nSpanish colonies in the West Indies. Even before the termination of the\r\nwar of 1755, a considerable commerce had been carried on between the\r\nBritish and Spanish colonies; the latter needed many of the productions\r\nand importations of the former, and the former needed the gold and\r\nsilver, molasses and sugar, of the latter. The British colonies sent\r\nlumber, fish, and large quantities of goods imported from England, to\r\nthe Spanish colonies, and received chiefly in payment gold and silver,\r\nwith which they made remittances to England for the goods purchased\r\nthere.[259] Such was the position of the colonies in respect to Great\r\nBritain and other European Powers at the peace of Paris in 1763; and\r\nsuch the friendly and affectionate feelings of the colonies towards the\r\nmother country down to that period.\r\n\r\nIII. The treaty of Paris was ratified in February, 1763; and on the 17th\r\nof March following, the Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted among the\r\nestimates the following item, which was adopted by the Commons:\r\n\r\n\"Upon account, to enable his Majesty to give a proper compensation to\r\nthe respective provinces in North America, for the expenses incurred by\r\nthem in the levying, clothing, and paying of the troops raised by the\r\nsame, according to the active vigour and strenuous efforts of the\r\nrespective provinces shall be thought by his Majesty to merit, £133,333\r\n6s. 8d.\"\r\n\r\nThe several provinces gratefully acknowledged the compensation granted\r\nthem; of which Massachusetts received the largest share.\r\n\r\nThis was the last practical recognition on the part of the British\r\nGovernment of the loyal co-operation of the colonies in the war which\r\nestablished the supremacy of Great Britain in North America. From that\r\ntime forward the instructions, regulations, and measures of the British\r\nGovernment seem to have been dictated by a jealousy of the growing\r\nwealth and power of the colonies, and to have been designed to weaken\r\nthe colonies in order to strengthen the parent state. The policy of the\r\nBritish Administration was undoubtedly to extinguish all military spirit\r\nin the colonies, by creating a standing army which the colonies were to\r\nsupport, but wholly independent of them; to discountenance and forbid\r\ncolonial manufactures, so as to render the colonies entirely dependent\r\nupon Great Britain for manufactured goods, hardware, and tools of every\r\ndescription; to destroy their trade with foreign countries by virtually\r\nprohibitory duties, so as to compel the colonies to go to the English\r\nmarket for every article of grocery or luxury, in whatever climate or\r\ncountry produced; to restrict the colonial shipping, as well as\r\nproductions, to British ports alone, and even to tax the trade of the\r\ncolonies with each other. All the monies arising from the various duties\r\nthus imposed were to be paid, not into the provincial treasuries, as\r\nheretofore, but into the English exchequer, and to be at the disposal of\r\nthe British Parliament.\r\n\r\nHad the British Government regarded the colonists as Englishmen in their\r\nrights and privileges as well as in their duties and obligations; had\r\nthe British policy been to develop the manufactures and resources of the\r\nAmerican colonies equally with those of England, and to leave to their\r\nlocal Legislatures (the only Parliaments in which the colonists had\r\nrepresentation by their own election) to legislate on all purely\r\ndomestic matters, to dispose of all colonial revenues, and to provide\r\nfor their own protection, as before the war with France, and as is done\r\nin the provinces and Dominion of Canada, I doubt not but the American\r\ncolonies would have remained in heart and policy an integral portion of\r\nthe British empire, and become the strong right arm of Great Britain in\r\nregard to both national resources and national strength. I cannot,\r\ntherefore, but regard the mistaken policy of the King and his Ministers\r\nas the primary cause of the alienation and severance of the American\r\ncolonies from the mother country.\r\n\r\nIV. The proceedings after the peace of Paris, 1763, which caused the\r\nalienation of the colonies from Great Britain, commenced on the part of\r\nthe mother country, towards which, at that time, the language of the\r\ncolonies was most affectionate and grateful. The first act of the\r\nBritish Government which caused disquiet in the colonies was the\r\nrigorous enforcement of the Navigation Act--an Act first passed by the\r\nCommonwealth Parliament more than a century before, which had been\r\namended and extended by successive Acts under Charles the Second, which\r\nhad been beneficial both to the mother country and the colonies, which\r\nhad given to the naval and mercantile marine of Great Britain their\r\nsuperiority, but which had, in the application of its provisions to the\r\ntrade between the English, Spanish, and French colonies of America,\r\nbecome almost obsolete by the common consent and practice of colonial\r\ngovernors, custom-house officers, and merchants. But shortly after the\r\ntreaty of Paris instructions were sent to the colonies, directing the\r\nstrict enforcement of the Navigation Act. \"On the 10th of March, 1764,\r\nthe House of Commons agreed to a number of resolutions respecting the\r\nAmerican trade; upon which a Bill was brought in, and passed into a law,\r\nlaying heavy duties on the articles imported into the colonies from the\r\nFrench and other islands of the West Indies, and ordered these duties to\r\nbe paid in specie into the exchequer of Great Britain. The Americans\r\ncomplained much of this new law, and of the unexampled hardship of being\r\nfirst deprived of obtaining specie, and next being ordered to pay the\r\nnew duties in specie into the treasury at London, which they said must\r\nspeedily drain them of all the specie they had. But what seemed\r\nparticularly hard upon them was a Bill brought in the same session, and\r\npassed into a law, 'to _restrain_ the currency of paper money in the\r\ncolonies.'\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the session the King thanked the House of Commons for the\r\n'wise regulations which had been established to augment the public\r\nrevenues, to unite the interests of the most distant possessions of his\r\nCrown, and to encourage and secure their commerce with Great\r\nBritain.'\"[262]\r\n\r\nThough the Bill and regulations referred to legalized in a manner the\r\nheretofore illicit trade between the colonies and the French and Spanish\r\nWest India islands, they practically ruined the trade by the burden of\r\nduties imposed, and thus distressed and ruined many who were engaged in\r\nit.[263] It is not surprising that such a policy of restricting both\r\nthe import and export trade of the colonies to England, apart from the\r\nmethods of enforcing it, should produce general dissatisfaction in the\r\ncolonies, and prompt to combinations against such extortion, and for the\r\nsupply of their own wants, as far as possible independent of English\r\nmanufactures. Popular meetings were held, and associations were formed\r\nin several provinces, pledging their members against purchasing or\r\nwearing clothing of English manufacture, and to set about manufacturing\r\nwoollens, cottons, etc., for themselves, the materials for which they\r\nhad in great abundance of their own production. Ladies and gentlemen of\r\nthe wealthiest and most fashionable classes of society appeared in\r\nhomespun; and merchants pledged themselves to order no more goods from\r\nEngland, and to countermand the orders they had previously given.[264]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap. v., p. 78.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards having taken part in the war, were, at the termination of\r\nit, induced to relinquish to the same Power both East and West Florida\r\n(in exchange for Cuba). This peace gave Great Britain possession of an\r\nextent of country equal in dimensions to several of the kingdoms of\r\nEurope.\" (Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., p. 391.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap.\r\nv., pp. 321, 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: \"From the first settlement of English America till the\r\nclose of the war of 1755, the general conduct of Great Britain towards\r\nher colonies affords a useful lesson to those who are disposed to\r\ncolonization. From that era, it is equally worthy of the attention of\r\nthose who wish for the reduction of great empires to small ones. In the\r\nfirst period, Great Britain regarded the provinces as instruments of\r\ncommerce. Without the care of their internal police, or seeking a\r\nrevenue from them, she contented herself with the monopoly of their\r\ntrade. She treated them as a judicious mother does her dutiful children.\r\nThey shared in every privilege belonging to her native sons, and but\r\nslightly felt the inconveniences of subordination. Small was the\r\ncatalogue of grievances with which even democratic jealousy charged the\r\nparent state, antecedent to the period before mentioned. Till the year\r\n1764, the colonial regulations seemed to have no other object but the\r\ncommon good of the whole empire. Exceptions to the contrary were few,\r\nand had no appearance of system. When the approach of the colonies to\r\nmanhood made them more capable of resisting impositions, Great Britain\r\nchanged her ancient system, under which her colonies had long\r\nflourished. When policy would rather have dictated a relaxation of\r\nauthority, she rose in her demands and multiplied her restraints.\"\r\n(Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., page 323).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: \"This trade, though it did not clash with the spirit of\r\nthe British navigation laws, was forbidden by their letter. On account\r\nof the advantages which all parties, and particularly Great Britain,\r\nreaped from this intercourse, it had long been winked at by persons in\r\npower[260]; but at the period before mentioned (1764), some new\r\nregulations were adopted by which it was almost destroyed.[261] This was\r\neffected by cutters whose commanders were enjoined to take the usual\r\ncustom-house oaths, and to act in the capacity of revenue officers. So\r\nsudden a stoppage of an accustomed and beneficial commerce, by an\r\nunusually rigid execution of old laws, was a serious blow to the\r\nnorthern colonies. It was their misfortune that, though they stood in\r\nneed of vast quantities of British manufactures, their country produced\r\nvery little that afforded a direct remittance to pay for them. They were\r\ntherefore under the necessity of seeking elsewhere a market for their\r\nproduce, and, by a circuitous route, acquiring the means of supporting\r\ntheir credit with the mother country. This they had found by trading\r\nwith the Spanish and French colonies in their neighbourhood. From them\r\nthey acquired gold, silver, and valuable commodities, the ultimate\r\nprofits of which centred in Great Britain. This intercourse gave life to\r\nbusiness of every denomination, and established a reciprocal circulation\r\nof money and merchandise, to the benefit of all parties concerned. Why a\r\ntrade essential to the colonies, and which, so far from being\r\ndetrimental, was indirectly advantageous to Great Britain, should be so\r\nnarrowly watched, so severely restrained, was not obvious to the\r\nAmericans. Instead of viewing the parent state, as formerly, in the\r\nlight of an affectionate mother, they conceived her as beginning to be\r\ninfluenced by the narrow views of an illiberal stepdame.\"--_Ib._, pp.\r\n324, 325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, in a letter to Richard\r\nJackson, Grenville's Secretary in the Exchequer, September, 1763, says,\r\n\"The real cause of the illicit trade in this Province (Massachusetts)\r\nhas been _the indulgence of the officers of the Customs_; and we are\r\ntold that the cause of this indulgence has been that they are quartered\r\nupon for more than their legal fees, and that without bribery and\r\ncorruption they must starve.\"\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of this \"bribery and corruption,\" the deposition on oath\r\nof the Deputy Collector of his Majesty's Customs at the port of Salem is\r\ngiven, to the effect that every time he had been in the office it had\r\nbeen customary for the Collector to receive of the masters of the\r\nvessels entering from Lisbon casks of wine, boxes of fruit, etc., which\r\nwas a gratuity for suffering their vessels to be entered with salt or\r\nballast only, and passing over unnoticed such cargoes of wine, fruit,\r\netc., which were prohibited to be imported into his Majesty's\r\nplantations; part of which wine, fruit, etc., the Collector used to\r\nshare with Governor Barnard.

By adhering to\r\nthe spirit of her Navigation Act, in the course of a century the trade\r\nof Great Britain had increased far beyond the expectation of her most\r\nsanguine sons; but by rigidly enforcing the strict letter of the same in\r\na different situation of public affairs, effects directly the reverse\r\nwere produced.\"--_Ib._, p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Prior Documents; or a Collection of Interesting Authentic\r\nPapers relating to the Dispute between Great Britain and America,\r\nshowing the causes and progress of that misunderstanding from 1764 to\r\n1775, pp. 1, 2; London, 1777.\r\n\r\n\"Four great wars within seventy years had overwhelmed Great Britain with\r\nheavy debts and excessive taxation. Her recent conquests, so far from\r\nrelieving her embarrassments, had greatly increased that debt, which\r\namounted now to £140,000,000, near $700,000,000. Even in the midst of\r\nthe struggle, in the success of which they had so direct an interest,\r\nthe military contributions of the colonial assemblies had been sometimes\r\nreluctant and capricious, and always irregular and unequal. They might,\r\nperhaps, refuse to contribute at all towards a standing army in time of\r\npeace, of which they would naturally soon become jealous. It seemed\r\nnecessary, therefore, by some exertion of metropolitan authority, to\r\nextract from the colonies for this purpose a regular and certain\r\nrevenue.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. II. Chap.\r\nxxviii., p. 516.)\r\n\r\nThis was avowed by the great commoner, Pitt himself, the special friend\r\nof America. \"In the course of the war between France and England, some\r\nof the colonies made exertions so far beyond their equitable quota as to\r\nmerit a reimbursement from the national treasury; but this was not\r\nuniversally the case. In consequence of internal discord, together with\r\ntheir greater domestic security, the necessary supplies had not been\r\nraised in due time by others of the provincial assemblies. That a\r\nBritish Minister should depend on the colonial assemblies for the\r\nexecution of his plans, did not well accord with the decisive genius of\r\nPitt; but it was not prudent, by any innovation, to irritate the\r\ncolonies during a war in which, from local circumstances, their\r\nexertions were peculiarly beneficial. The advantages that would result\r\nfrom an ability to draw forth the resources of the colonies, by the same\r\nauthority which commanded the wealth of the mother country, might, in\r\nthese circumstances, have suggested the idea of taxing the colonies by\r\nauthority of the British Parliament. Mr. Pitt is said to have told Dr.\r\nFranklin that 'when the war closed, if he should be in the Ministry, he\r\nwould take measures to prevent the colonies from having a power to\r\nrefuse or delay the supplies that might be wanted for national\r\npurposes,' but he did not mention what those measures should be.\"\r\n(Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., pp. 320, 321.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: In the work mentioned in last note, \"Prior Documents,\"\r\netc., extracts of letters are given, showing the effects of the acts and\r\nregulations of commerce, even in the West Indies.

A fine of\r\n£10 was imposed for each non-compliance with the Act, the enforcement of\r\nwhich was not left to the ordinary courts and juries, but to Courts of\r\nAdmiralty without juries, the officers of which were appointed by the\r\nCrown, and paid fees out of the fines which they imposed--the informer\r\nreceiving one-half. The year's notice[267] of this Bill had given the\r\nopportunity of discussing the merits of it on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic. The King, at the opening of the session, had presented the\r\ncolonial question as one of \"obedience to the laws and respect for the\r\nlegislative authority of the kingdom;\" and the Lords and Commons, in\r\nreply, declared their intention to pursue every plan calculated for the\r\npublic advantage, and to proceed therein \"with that temper and firmness\r\nwhich will best conciliate and ensure due submission to the laws and\r\nreverence for the legislative authority of Great Britain.\" As it was a\r\nmoney Bill, no petitions were allowed to be presented to the Commons\r\nagainst it. Several members spoke against it, of whom General Conway and\r\nColonel Barré were the principal, both of whom had served in\r\nAmerica;[268] but the Bill was passed by a majority of five to one. In\r\nAmerica, the old, loyal Church of England colony of Virginia led the way\r\nin opposition to the Bill, the General Assembly of Burgesses being in\r\nsession when the news of its having been passed by the British\r\nParliament reached America; and the resolutions which that Assembly\r\npassed covered the whole ground of colonial opposition to the Stamp\r\nAct.[269] The Assembly of Virginia sent copies of its resolutions to the\r\nother colonies, and several of their Legislatures adopted the same or\r\nsimilar resolutions. Two days after adopting the resolutions, the\r\nGovernor dismissed the Legislature and ordered new elections; but at the\r\nnew elections all who voted for the resolutions were re-elected, and all\r\nwho opposed them were rejected; so that the newly-elected Assembly was\r\neven more unanimous against the Stamp Act than the Assembly which had\r\nbeen dismissed. It was said \"the fire began in Virginia;\" \"Virginia\r\nrang the alarm bell;\" \"Virginia gave the signal for the continent.\" The\r\npetition from the Assembly of New York was stronger than that from\r\nVirginia--\"so bold that when it reached London no one would present it\r\nto Parliament.\" The remonstrance of Massachusetts was feebler, it having\r\nbeen modified by the Lieutenant-Governor, Hutchinson, and the Governor,\r\nBarnard. Rhode Island followed New York and Virginia. The Legislature of\r\nConnecticut protested at once against the stamp tax, and sent decided\r\ninstructions to their agent in London to insist firmly upon their rights\r\nof taxation and trial by jury. When the news of these things reached\r\nEngland, and the colonial agents made their remonstrances, it was asked,\r\n\"Will the colonies resist?\" That was not believed to be possible even by\r\nFranklin; but though no physical resistance was thought of in any part\r\nof America, yet the opposition to the Stamp Act became increasingly\r\nintense among all classes, from the first announcement of it in May to\r\nthe prescribed time of its going into operation, the 1st of November;\r\nand armed resistance seems to have been viewed as a possible alternative\r\nin the future. It was as yet looked upon as a contest between the\r\ncolonists and the Parliament and advisers of the King, and not with the\r\nKing himself, to whom ardent loyalty was professed and no doubt felt. It\r\nwas at length proposed that a general Congress of representatives of all\r\nthe colonies should be held to confer on the measures necessary to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Legislature met the latter part of May, and\r\nrecommended, on the 6th of June, the calling of a Congress, to be\r\ncomposed of \"Committees from the Houses of Representatives or Burgesses\r\nin the several colonies,\" to meet at New York on the first Tuesday of\r\nOctober following, there to consult \"on the difficulties in which the\r\ncolonies were and must be placed by the late Acts of Parliament levying\r\nduties and taxes upon them, and to consider of a general and humble\r\naddress to his Majesty and the Parliament to implore relief.\" A circular\r\nletter was prepared and sent to the Speakers of the Legislative\r\nAssemblies of other colonies; and a Committee was chosen for\r\nMassachusetts. On the 7th of October a Congress met at New York,\r\nconsisting of 28 delegates from the Assemblies of Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, the Delaware counties, Maryland, and South Carolina. The\r\nsession of this convention or congress lasted three weeks; the members\r\nwere found to be of one opinion on the principal subjects discussed. A\r\ndeclaration of the rights and grievances of the colonies was agreed to,\r\nin which all the privileges of Englishmen were claimed as the birthright\r\nof the colonists, including the right of being taxed only by their own\r\nconsent. A petition to the King and memorials to each House of\r\nParliament were prepared and adopted. The Assemblies of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, and Georgia were prevented by their Governors from sending\r\nrepresentatives to the Congress; but they forwarded petitions to England\r\nsimilar to those adopted by the Congress.[270] It is worthy of remark,\r\nthat, with the exception of Boston, the proceedings of the populace, as\r\nwell as of the Conventions and Legislative Assemblies, against the Stamp\r\nAct, were conducted in a legal and orderly manner, such as to command\r\nrespect in England as well as in America. But in Boston there had always\r\nbeen a mob, which, under the direction and auspices of men behind the\r\nscenes, and opposed to British rule in any form, was ready to come forth\r\nas opportunity offered in lawless violence against the authority of the\r\nCrown and its officers. In England, eighty years before, mobs were\r\nemployed to intimidate the Court, Lords, and Commons in passing the Bill\r\nof Attainder against Strafford, and against Bishops and Episcopacy. The\r\nRev. Dr. Burgess, the most popular Puritan minister in London at that\r\ntime, called them his \"band-dogs,\" to be let loose or restrained as\r\noccasion required.[271] Such men as the \"band-dogs\" of Boston, who\r\nfound a good opportunity for the exercise of their vocation during the\r\ndiscussions of the local Legislature and public meetings against the\r\nStamp Act, not content with the harmless acts of patriotism of hanging\r\nLord Bute and Mr. Andrew Oliver (the proposed distributors of the\r\nstamps) in effigy and then making bonfires of them, they levelled Mr.\r\nOliver's office buildings to the ground, and broke the windows and\r\ndestroyed most of the furniture of his house. Some days afterwards they\r\nproceeded to the house of William Story, Deputy Registrar of the Court\r\nof Admiralty, and destroyed his private papers, as well as the records\r\nand files of the Court. They next entered and purloined the house of\r\nBenjamin Hallowell, jr., Comptroller of the Customs, and regaled\r\nthemselves to intoxication with the liquors which they found in his\r\ncellar. They then, as Mr. Hildreth says, \"proceeded to the mansion of\r\nGovernor Hutchinson, in North Square. The Lieutenant-Governor and his\r\nfamily fled for their lives.[272] The house was completely gutted, and\r\nthe contents burned in bonfires kindled in the square. Along with\r\nHutchinson's public and private papers perished many invaluable\r\nmanuscripts relating to the history of the province, which Hutchinson\r\nhad been thirty years in collecting, and which it was impossible to\r\nreplace.\"[273] The universal and intense opposition of all ranks in all\r\nthe colonies (except a few of the office-holders) was re-echoed and\r\nstrengthened by opposition and remonstrances from the merchants and\r\nmanufacturers in England and Scotland connected with the American\r\ntrade.[274] Parliament met the 17th December, 1765, when one reason\r\nassigned in the Royal speech for calling Parliament together earlier\r\nthan usual was the importance of matters which had occurred in America,\r\nall papers connected with which would be laid before them. After the\r\nChristmas recess, the Parliament met the 17th of January, 1766, when\r\nAmerican affairs were again commended in a speech from the Throne as a\r\nprincipal object of parliamentary deliberations. Both Houses, in their\r\nreplies to the King, showed that they regarded American affairs in the\r\nsame important light as his Majesty; and for more than two months those\r\naffairs constituted the principal subject of parliamentary debate, and\r\nthe leading topics of conversation among all classes. The application of\r\nthe Commons was unwearied; their sittings continued until after\r\nmidnight, and sometimes even until morning; the number of petitions they\r\nreceived, the multitude of papers and the witnesses they had to examine,\r\noccupied much time, accompanied by continual debates. The authors of the\r\nStamp Act were now in opposition, and made most strenuous efforts in its\r\njustification. The debates turned chiefly on two questions: 1. Whether\r\nthe Legislature of Great Britain had, or had not, a right of taxation\r\nover the colonies; 2. Whether the late laws, especially the Stamp Act,\r\nwere just and expedient. In the ultimate decision of the first question\r\nboth parties agreed, and the House affirmed, without a division, \"That\r\nthe Parliament of Great Britain had a right to bind the colonies in all\r\ncases whatsoever,\" without any distinction in regard to taxation. As to\r\nthe second question, Parliament decided, after very warm and protracted\r\ndebates, in favour of the total repeal of the Stamp Act. Accordingly two\r\nBills were brought in, pursuant to these resolutions: the one, a\r\ndeclaratory Bill, entitled \"An Act for securing the defence of the\r\nAmerican colonies of Great Britain,\" and asserting the right of\r\nParliament to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever; the other, for\r\nthe total repeal of the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\n[Colonel Barré's celebrated reply to Charles Townsend, and review of it,\r\non the passing of the Stamp Act, will be found in Appendix A. to this\r\nchapter; and Lord Chancellor Camden's opinion, and the great commoner\r\nPitt's memorable sayings in the discussion on the _repeal_ of the Stamp\r\nAct, will be found in Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaratory Act, though avowing the absolute power of Parliament to\r\nbind the colonies in all cases whatsoever, and rescinding, as far as an\r\nAct of Parliament could, all the declarations and resolutions which had\r\nbeen adopted by the Colonial Assemblies and public meetings against the\r\nauthority of Parliament, attracted very little attention amid the\r\nabsorbing interest centred in the Stamp Act, and the universal\r\nrejoicings on both sides of the Atlantic at its repeal. The Declaratory\r\nAct, as it was called, passed the Commons the beginning of February; and\r\non the 18th of the month, after a vehement discussion, closed by the\r\nspeeches of Messrs. Grenville and Pitt, the House of Commons, at three\r\no'clock in the morning, repealed the Stamp Act by a majority of 275 to\r\n167. The House of Lords, after warm and protracted discussions, voted\r\nfor its repeal by a majority of 100 to 71; and three days afterwards,\r\nthe 18th of March, the royal assent was given to the Act--\"An event,\"\r\nsays the Annual Register for 1766, \"that caused more universal joy\r\nthroughout the British dominions than perhaps any other that can be\r\nremembered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ships in the River Thames displayed their colours, and houses were\r\nilluminated all over the city. It was no sooner known in America, than\r\nthe colonists rescinded their resolutions, and recommenced their\r\nmercantile intercourse with the mother country. They presented their\r\nhomespun clothes to the poor, and imported more largely than ever. The\r\nchurches resounded with thanksgivings; and their public and private\r\nrejoicings knew no bounds. By letters, addresses, and other means,\r\nalmost all the colonies showed unequivocal marks of acknowledgment and\r\ngratitude. So sudden a calm after so violent a storm is without a\r\nparallel in history. By the judicious sacrifice of one law, Great\r\nBritain procured an acquiescence in all that remained.\"[275]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A. TO CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION BETWEEN CHARLES TOWNSEND AND COLONEL BARRÉ IN THE DEBATE ON\r\nPASSING THE STAMP ACT, REFERRED TO ON PAGE 293.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the discussion on this Bill that Colonel Barré made the\r\nfamous retort to Mr. Charles Townsend, head of the Board of Trade. Mr.\r\nTownsend made an able speech in support of the Bill and the equity of\r\nthe taxation, and insisted that the colonies had borne but a small\r\nproportion of the expenses of the last war, and had yet obtained by it\r\nimmense advantages at a vast expense to the mother country. He concluded\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n\"And now will these American children, planted by our care, nourished\r\nby our indulgence to a degree of strength and opulence, and protected by\r\nour arms, grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy\r\nburden under which we lie?\"\r\n\r\nAs he sat down, Colonel Barré rose and replied with great energy, and,\r\nunder the influence of intense excitement, uttered the following\r\nimpassioned retort to the concluding words of Charles Townsend's speech:\r\n\r\n\"_They planted by your care!_ No; your oppressions planted them in\r\nAmerica. They fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated,\r\ninhospitable country, where they exposed themselves to almost all the\r\nhardships to which human nature is liable, and among others to the\r\ncruelties of a savage foe--the most subtle, and I will take upon me to\r\nsay the most formidable of any people upon the face of God's earth; and\r\nyet, actuated by principles of true English liberty, they met all\r\nhardships with pleasure, compared with those they suffered in their own\r\ncountry from the hands of those who should have been their friends.\r\n\r\n\"_They nourished by your indulgence!_ They grew by your neglect of them.\r\nAs soon as you began to care about them, that care was exercised in\r\nsending persons to rule over them, in one department and another, who\r\nwere perhaps the deputies of deputies to some members of this House,\r\nsent to spy out their liberties, to misrepresent their actions, and to\r\nprey upon them; men whose behaviour, on many occasions, has caused the\r\nblood of those _sons of liberty_ to recoil within them; men promoted to\r\nthe highest seats of justice--some who, to my knowledge, were glad, by\r\ngoing to a foreign country, to escape being brought to the bar of a\r\nCourt of justice in their own.\r\n\r\n\"_They protected by your arms!_ They have nobly taken up arms in your\r\ndefence; have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious\r\nindustry, for the defence of a country whose frontier was drenched in\r\nblood, while its interior parts yielded all its little savings to your\r\nemolument. And, believe me--remember, I this day told you so--the same\r\nspirit of freedom which actuated that people at first will accompany\r\nthem still. But prudence forbids me to explain myself further. God\r\nknows, I do not at this time speak from motives of party heat; what I\r\ndeliver are the genuine sentiments of my heart. However superior to me\r\nin general knowledge and experience the respectable body of this House\r\nmay be, yet I claim to know more of America than most of you, having\r\nseen and been conversant in that country. The people, I believe, are as\r\ntruly loyal as any subjects the King has; but a people jealous of their\r\nliberties, and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated.\r\nBut the subject is too delicate; I will say no more.\"\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the Speeches of Mr. Charles Townsend and Colonel Barré._\r\n\r\nPerhaps the English language does not present a more eloquent and\r\ntouching appeal than these words of Colonel Barré, the utterances of a\r\nsincere and patriotic heart. They were taken down by a friend at the\r\ntime of delivery, sent across the Atlantic, published and circulated in\r\nevery form throughout America, and probably produced more effect upon\r\nthe minds of the colonists than anything ever uttered or written. Very\r\nlikely not one out of a thousand of those who have read them, carried\r\naway by their eloquence and fervour, has ever thought of analysing them\r\nto ascertain how far they are just or true; yet I am bound to say that\r\ntheir misstatements are such as to render their argument fallacious from\r\nbeginning to end, with the exception of their just tribute to the\r\ncharacter of the American colonists.\r\n\r\nThe words of Charles Townsend were insulting to the colonists to the\r\nlast degree, and were open to the severest rebuke. He assumed that\r\nbecause the settlements in America were infant settlements, in\r\ncomparison with those of the mother country, the settlers themselves\r\nwere but children, and should be treated as such; whereas the fathers of\r\nnew settlements and their commerce, the guiding spirits in their\r\nadvancement, are the most advanced men of their nation and age, the\r\npioneers of enterprise and civilization; and as such they are entitled\r\nto peculiar respect and consideration, instead of their being referred\r\nto as children, and taxed without their consent by men who, whatever\r\ntheir rank in the society and public affairs of England, could not\r\ncompare with them in what constituted real manhood greatness. But though\r\nCharles Townsend's insulting haughtiness to the American colonists, and\r\nhis proposal to treat them as minors, destitute of the feelings and\r\nrights of grown-up Englishmen, merited the severest rebuke, yet that did\r\nnot justify the statements and counter-pretensions on which Colonel\r\nBarré founded that rebuke. Let us briefly examine some of his\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n1. He says that the oppressions of England planted the settlers in\r\nAmerica, who fled from English tyranny to a then uncultivated,\r\ninhospitable country.\r\n\r\nIn reply it may be affirmed, as a notorious fact, that the southern and\r\nmiddle colonies, even to Pennsylvania, were nationalized by the kings of\r\nEngland from their commencement, and were frequently assisted by both\r\nKing and Parliament. The Dutch and the Swedes were the fathers of the\r\nsettlements of New York and New Jersey. The \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" the\r\nfounders of the Plymouth colony, did, however, flee from persecution in\r\nEngland in the first years of King James, but found their eleven years'\r\nresidence in Holland less agreeable than settlement under English rule,\r\nor rather English indulgence, in America. The founders of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay settlement were a Puritan section of the Church of\r\nEngland, of which they professed to be devoted members after they\r\nembarked for America. A wealthy company of them determined to found a\r\nsettlement in America, where they could enjoy the pure worship of the\r\nChurch of England without the ceremonies enjoined by Archbishop\r\nLaud--where they could convert the savage Indians, and pursue the fur\r\nand fish trade, and agriculture; but they were no more driven to America\r\nby the \"tyranny\" of England, than the hundreds of thousands of Puritans\r\nwho remained in England, overthrew the monarchy, beheaded the king,\r\nabolished the Church of England, first established Presbyterianism and\r\nthen abolished it, and determined upon the establishment of\r\nCongregationalism at the moment of Cromwell's death. But those \"Puritan\r\nFathers\" who came to Massachusetts Bay, actually came under the auspices\r\nof a \"Royal Charter,\" which they cherished as the greatest boon\r\nconferred upon any people. But among their first acts after their\r\narrival at Massachusetts Bay was that to abolish the Church of England\r\nworship itself, and set up the Congregational worship in its place; to\r\nproscribe the Common Prayer Book, and forbid its use even in private\r\nfamilies, and to banish those who persisted in its use. And instead of\r\nconverting and christianizing the savage heathen--the chief professed\r\nobject of their emigration, and so expressed in their Royal Charter of\r\nincorporation--they never sent a missionary or established a school\r\namong them for more than twelve years; and then the first and long the\r\nonly missionary among the Indians was John Elliott, self-appointed, and\r\nsupported by contributions from England. But during those twelve years,\r\nand afterwards, they slew the Indians by thousands, as the Canaanites\r\nand Amalekites, to be rooted out of the land which God had given to \"the\r\nsaints\" (that is, to themselves), to be possessed and enjoyed by them.\r\nThe savage foe, whose arms were bows and arrows,[276] were made\r\n\"formidable\" in defence of their homes, which they had inherited from\r\ntheir forefathers; and if, in defence and attempted recovery of their\r\nhomes when driven from them, they inflicted, after their own mode of\r\nwarfare, \"cruelties\" upon their invaders, yet they themselves were the\r\ngreatest sufferers, almost to annihilation.[277]\r\n\r\n2. \"The colonies being nourished by the indulgence\" of England, assumed\r\nby Charles Townsend, is the second ground of Colonel Barré's retort, who\r\naffirmed that the colonies grew by England's neglect of them, and that\r\nas soon as she began to care for them, that care was exercised in\r\nsending persons to rule over them in one department or another, etc.\r\n\r\nIn reply, let it be remembered that three out of the four New England\r\ncolonies--Plymouth, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--elected their own\r\ngovernors and officers from the beginning to the end of their colonial\r\nexistence, as did Massachusetts during the first half century of her\r\nfirst Charter, which she forfeited by her usurpations, persecutions, and\r\nencroachments upon the rights of others, as I have shown in Chapter VI.\r\nof this history; and it has been shown in Chapter VII., on the authority\r\nof Puritan ministers, jurists, and historians, that during the seventy\r\nyears that Massachusetts was ruled under the second Royal Charter, her\r\ngovernors being appointed by the Crown, she advanced in social unity, in\r\nbreadth and dignity of legislation, and in equity of government,\r\ncommerce, and prosperity, beyond anything she had enjoyed and manifested\r\nunder the first Charter--so much so, that the neighbouring colonies\r\nwould have gladly been favoured with her system of government. It is\r\npossible there may have been individual instances of inefficiency, and\r\neven failure of character, in some officers of the Government during a\r\nperiod of seventy years, as is the case in all Governments, but such\r\ninstances were few, if they occurred at all, and such as to afford no\r\njust pretext for the rhapsody and insinuations of Colonel Barré on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n3. In the third place, Colonel Barré denied that the colonies had been\r\ndefended by the arms of England, and said, on the contrary, \"they have\r\nnobly taken arms in your defence.\" It is true the colonists carried on\r\ntheir own local contests with the Indians. The northern colonies\r\nconceived the idea of driving the French out of America, and twice\r\nattacked Quebec for that purpose, but they failed; and the French and\r\nIndians made such encroachments upon them that they implored aid from\r\nEngland \"to prevent their being driven into the sea.\" It was not until\r\nEngland \"nobly took up arms\" in their behalf, and sent navies and armies\r\nfor their \"defence,\" that the progress of French arms and Indian\r\ndepredations were arrested in America, and the colonists were delivered\r\nfrom enemies who had disturbed their peace and endangered their safety\r\nfor more than a century. At the close of the last French war, the\r\ncolonies themselves, through their Legislatures, gratefully acknowledged\r\ntheir indebtedness to the mother country for their deliverance and\r\nsafety, which, without her aid, they said they never could have secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF MR. GRENVILLE, MR. PITT, AND LORD CAMDEN (FORMERLY CHIEF\r\nJUSTICE PRATT) ON THE STAMP ACT AND ITS REPEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great commoner, Pitt, was not present in the Commons when the\r\nDeclaratory and Stamp Acts were passed in 1765; but he was present at\r\none sitting when an address to the King, in reply to a speech from the\r\nThrone, relating to opposition in America to the Stamp Act, was\r\ndiscussed, and in which the propriety of repealing that Act was mooted\r\nand partially argued. Mr. Pitt held the right of Parliament to impose\r\nexternal taxes on the colonies by imposing duties on goods imported into\r\nthem, but not to impose internal taxes, such as the Stamp Act imposed.\r\nIn the course of his speech Mr. Pitt said:\r\n\r\n\"It is a long time since I have attended in Parliament. When the\r\nresolution was taken in the House to tax America, I was ill in bed. If I\r\ncould have endured to have been carried in my bed, so great was the\r\nagitation of my mind for the consequences, I would have solicited some\r\nkind hand to have laid me down on this floor, to have borne my testimony\r\nagainst it. It is now an Act that has been passed. I would speak with\r\ndecency of every act of this House; but I must beg the indulgence to\r\nspeak of it with freedom.\r\n\r\n\"As my health and life are so very infirm and precarious, that I may not\r\nbe able to attend on the day that may be fixed by this House for the\r\nconsideration of America, I must now, though somewhat unseasonably,\r\nleaving the expediency of the Stamp Act to some other time, speak to a\r\npoint of infinite moment--I mean the right. On a question that may\r\nmortally wound the freedom of three millions of virtuous and brave\r\nsubjects beyond the Atlantic Ocean, I cannot be silent. America being\r\nneither really nor virtually represented in Westminster, cannot be held\r\nlegally, or constitutionally, or reasonably subject to obedience to any\r\nmoney bill of this kingdom. The colonies are, equally with yourselves,\r\nentitled to all the natural rights of mankind, and the peculiar\r\nprivileges of Englishmen; equally bound by the laws, and equally\r\nparticipating in the constitution of this free country. The Americans\r\nare the sons, not the bastards, of England. As subjects, they are\r\nentitled to the common right of representation, and cannot be bound to\r\npay taxes without their consent....\r\n\r\n\"The Commons of America, represented in their several Assemblies, have\r\never been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional\r\nright, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been\r\nslaves if they had not enjoyed it....\r\n\r\n\"If this House suffers the Stamp Act to continue in force, France will\r\ngain more by your colonies than she ever could have done if her arms in\r\nthe last war had been victorious.\r\n\r\n\"I never shall own the justice of taxing America internally until she\r\nenjoys the right of representation. In every other point of legislation\r\nthe authority of Parliament is like the north star, fixed for the\r\nreciprocal benefit of the parent country and her colonies. The British\r\nParliament, as the supreme gathering and legislative power, has always\r\nbound them by her laws, by her regulations of their trade and\r\nmanufactures, and even in the more absolute interdiction of both. The\r\npower of Parliament, like the circulation from the human heart, active,\r\nvigorous, and perfect in the smallest fibre of the arterial system, may\r\nbe known in the colonies by the prohibition of their carrying a hat to\r\nmarket over the line of one province into another; or by breaking down\r\nthe loom in the most distant corner of the British empire in America;\r\nand if this power were denied, I would not permit them to manufacture a\r\nlock of wool, or form a horse-shoe or hob-nail. But I repeat the House\r\nhas no right to lay an internal tax upon America, that country not being\r\nrepresented.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Pitt ceased, a pause ensued, when General Conway rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"I not only adopt all that has just been said, but believe it expresses\r\nthe sentiments of most if not all the King's servants and wish it may be\r\nthe unanimous opinion of this House.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Grenville, author of the Stamp Act, now leader of the opposition,\r\nrecovering by this time his self-possession, replied at length to Mr.\r\nPitt. Among other things he said:\r\n\r\n\"The disturbances in America began in July, and now we are in the middle\r\nof January; lately they were only occurrences; they are now grown to\r\ntumults and riots; they border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I\r\nhave heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to\r\nproduce revolution. The government over them being dissolved, a\r\nrevolution will take place in America.\r\n\r\n\"External and internal taxation are the same in effect, and only differ\r\nin name. That the sovereign has the supreme legislative power over\r\nAmerica cannot be denied; and taxation is a part of sovereign power. It\r\nis one branch of the legislation. It has been and it is exercised over\r\nthose who are not and were never represented. It is exercised over the\r\nIndia Company, the merchants of London, the proprietors of the stocks,\r\nand over many great manufacturing towns.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"To hold that the King, by the concession of a Charter, can exempt a\r\nfamily or a colony from taxation by Parliament, degrades the\r\nconstitution of England. If the colonies, instead of throwing off\r\nentirely the authority of Parliament, had presented a petition to send\r\nto it deputies elected among themselves, this step would have evoked\r\ntheir attachment to the Crown and their affection for the mother\r\ncountry, and would have merited attention.\r\n\r\n\"The Stamp Act is but a pretext of which they make use to arrive at\r\nindependence. (French report.) It was thoroughly considered, and not\r\nhurried at the end of the session. It passed through the different\r\nstages in full Houses, with only one division. When I proposed to tax\r\nAmerica, I asked the House if any gentleman would object to the right; I\r\nrepeatedly asked it, and no man would attempt to deny it. Protection and\r\nobedience are reciprocal. Great Britain protects America; America is\r\nbound to yield obedience. If not, tell us when they were emancipated?\r\nWhen they wanted the protection of this kingdom, they were always ready\r\nto ask it. That protection has always been afforded them in the most\r\nfull and ample manner. The nation has run itself into an immense debt to\r\ngive it to them; and now that they are called upon to contribute a small\r\nshare towards an expense arising from themselves, they renounce your\r\nauthority, insult your officers, and break out, I might almost say, into\r\nopen rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"The seditious spirit of the colonists owes its birth to the factions in\r\nthis House. We were told we tread on tender ground; we were told to\r\nexpect disobedience. What was this but telling the Americans to stand\r\nout against the law, to encourage their obstinacy, with the expectation\r\nof support from hence? Let us only hold back a little, they would say;\r\nour friends will soon be in power.\r\n\r\n\"Ungrateful people of America! When I had the honour to serve the Crown,\r\nwhile you yourselves were loaded with an enormous debt of one hundred\r\nand forty millions sterling, and paid a revenue of ten millions\r\nsterling, you have given bounties on their timber, on their iron, their\r\nhemp, and many other articles. You have restored in their favour the Act\r\nof Navigation, that palladium of British commerce. I offered to do\r\neverything in my power to advance the trade of America. I discouraged no\r\ntrade but what was prohibited by Act of Parliament. I was above giving\r\nan answer to anonymous calumnies; but in this place it becomes me to\r\nwipe off the aspersion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Grenville sat down, several members got up; but the House clamoured\r\nfor Pitt, who seemed to rise. A point of order was decided in favour of\r\nhis speaking, and the cry of \"Go on, go on!\" resounded from all parts of\r\nthe House. Pitt, addressing the Speaker, said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I have been charged with giving birth to sedition in America. They\r\nhave spoken their sentiments with freedom against this unhappy Act, and\r\nthat freedom has become their crime. Sorry I am to hear the liberty of\r\nspeech in this House imputed as a crime. But the imputation shall not\r\ndiscourage me. It is a liberty I mean to exercise; no gentleman ought to\r\nbe afraid to exercise it. It is a liberty by which the gentleman who\r\ncalumniates it might and ought to have profited. He ought to have\r\ndesisted from his project. The gentleman tells us America is obstinate;\r\nAmerica is almost in open rebellion. I rejoice that America has\r\nresisted.\" (At this word the members of the House were startled as\r\nthough an electric spark had darted through them all.) \"I rejoice that\r\nAmerica has resisted. If its millions of inhabitants had submitted,\r\ntaxes would soon have been laid on Ireland; and if ever this nation\r\nshould have a tyrant for its king, six millions of freemen, so dead to\r\nall the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would\r\nbe fit instruments to make slaves of the rest.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman tells us of many who are taxed and are not\r\nrepresented--the East India Company, merchants, stockholders,\r\nmanufacturers. Surely many of these are represented in other capacities.\r\nIt is a misfortune that more are not actually represented. But they are\r\nall inhabitants of Great Britain, and as such are virtually represented.\r\nThey have connection with those that elect, and they have influence over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Not one of the Ministers who have taken the lead of government since\r\nthe accession of King William ever recommended a tax like this of the\r\nStamp Act. Lord Halifax, educated in the House of Commons; Lord Oxford,\r\nLord Orford, a great revenue minister (Walpole), never thought of this.\r\nNone of these ever dreamed of robbing the colonies of their\r\nconstitutional rights. This was reserved to mark the era of the late\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman boasts of his bounties to America. Are not these bounties\r\nintended finally for the benefit of this kingdom? If so, where is the\r\npeculiar merit to America? If they are not, he has misapplied the\r\nnational treasures.\r\n\r\n\"If the gentleman cannot understand the difference between internal and\r\nexternal taxes, I cannot help it. But there is a plain distinction\r\nbetween taxes levied for purposes of _raising revenue_ and duties\r\nimposed for the _regulation of trade_, for the accommodation of the\r\nsubject, although in the consequences some revenue may incidentally\r\narise for the latter.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman asks when were the colonies emancipated? I desire to know\r\nwhen they were made slaves? But I do not dwell upon words. The profits\r\nto Great Britain from the trade of the colonies through all its branches\r\nis two millions a year. This is the fund that carried you triumphantly\r\nthrough the last war. The estates that were rented at two thousand\r\npounds a year threescore years ago, are at three thousand pounds at\r\npresent. You owe this to America. This is the price that America pays\r\nfor your protection;[278] and shall a miserable financier come with a\r\nboast that he can fetch a peppercorn into the exchequer to the loss of\r\nmillions to the nation?[279] I dare not say how much higher these\r\nprofits may be augmented. Omitting the immense increase of people in the\r\nnorthern colonies by natural population, and the emigration from every\r\npart of Europe, I am convinced the whole commercial system may be\r\naltered to advantage.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the House what is really my\r\nopinion. It is that the Stamp Act be repealed absolutely, totally, and\r\nimmediately; that the reason for the repeal be assigned, because it was\r\nfounded on an erroneous principle. At the same time, let the sovereign\r\nauthority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong\r\nterms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of\r\nlegislation, that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures,\r\nand exercise every power whatsoever except that of taking their money\r\nout of their pockets without their consent.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be content with the advantage which Providence has bestowed upon\r\nus. We have attained the highest glory and greatness. Let us strive long\r\nto preserve them for our own happiness and that of our posterity.\"[280]\r\n\r\nThe effect of Pitt's speech was prodigious, combining cogency of\r\nargument with fervour of feeling, splendour of eloquence, and matchless\r\noratorical power. The very next day the Duke of Grafton advised the King\r\nto send for Pitt; but the King declined, though in a state of \"extreme\r\nagitation.\" Nevertheless, the Duke of Grafton himself sought an\r\ninterview with Pitt, who showed every disposition to unite with certain\r\nmembers and friends of the liberal Rockingham Administration to promote\r\nthe repeal of the Stamp Act and the pacification of America; but it was\r\nfound that many of the friends and advocates of America did not agree\r\nwith Pitt in denying the right of Parliament to tax America, though they\r\ndeemed it inexpedient and unjust. Pitt could not therefore accept\r\noffice. Mr. Bancroft remarks: \"The principle of giving up all taxation\r\nover the colonies, on which the union was to have rested, had implacable\r\nopponents in the family of Hardwicke, and in the person of Rockingham's\r\nown private secretary (Edmund Burke). 'If ever one man lived more\r\nzealous than another for the supremacy of Parliament, and the rights of\r\nthe imperial crown, it was Edmund Burke.' He was the advocate of 'an\r\nunlimited legislative power over the colonies.' 'He saw not how the\r\npower of taxation could be given up, without giving up the rest.' 'If\r\nPitt was able to see it, Pitt saw further than he could.' His wishes\r\nwere very earnest 'to keep the whole body of this authority perfect and\r\nentire.' He was jealous of it; he was honestly of that opinion; and\r\nRockingham, after proceeding so far, and finding in Pitt all the\r\nencouragement that he expected, let the negotiation drop. Conway and\r\nGrafton were compelled to disregard their own avowals on the question of\r\nthe right of taxation; the Ministry conformed to the opinion, which was\r\nthat of Charles Yorke, the Attorney-General, and still more of Edmund\r\nBurke.\"[281]\r\n\r\nWhile the repeal of the Stamp Act was under discussion in the Commons,\r\nDr. Franklin--then Deputy Postmaster-General for America--was summoned\r\nto give evidence at the bar of the House. His examination was long and\r\nminute. His thorough knowledge of all the subjects, his independence and\r\ncandour made a deep impression, but he was dismissed from office the day\r\nafter giving his evidence. Some of the questions and answers are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Question.--What is your name and place of abode?\r\n\r\n     Answer.--Franklin, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Do the Americans pay any considerable taxes among themselves?\r\n\r\n     A.--Certainly; many and very heavy taxes.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What are the present taxes in Pennsylvania levied by the laws\r\n     of the colony?\r\n\r\n     A.--There are taxes on all estates, real and personal; a poll-tax;\r\n     a tax on all offices, professions, trades, and businesses,\r\n     according to their profits; an excise on all wine, rum, and other\r\n     spirits; and a duty of £10 per head on all negroes imported; with\r\n     some other duties.\r\n\r\n     Q.--For what purpose are those taxes levied?\r\n\r\n     A.--For the support of the civil and military establishment of the\r\n     country, and to discharge the heavy debt contracted in the last\r\n     war.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Are not you concerned in the management of the post-office in\r\n     America?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes. I am Deputy Postmaster-General of North America.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Don't you think the distribution of stamps, by post, to all the\r\n     inhabitants, very practicable, if there was no opposition?\r\n\r\n     A.--The posts only go along the sea coasts; they do not, except in\r\n     a few instances, go back into the country; and if they did, sending\r\n     for stamps by post would occasion an expense of postage amounting,\r\n     in many cases, to much more than that of the stamps themselves.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Are not the colonies, from their circumstances, very able to\r\n     pay the stamp duty?\r\n\r\n     A.--In my opinion, there is not gold and silver enough in the\r\n     colonies to pay the stamp duty for one year.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Don't you know that the money arising from the stamps was all\r\n     to be laid out in America?\r\n\r\n     A.--I know it is appropriated by the Act to the American service;\r\n     but it will be spent in the conquered colonies, where the soldiers\r\n     are, not in the colonies that pay it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Is there not a balance of trade due from the colonies where the\r\n     troops are posted, that will bring back the money to the old\r\n     colonies?\r\n\r\n     A.--I think not. I believe very little would come back. I know of\r\n     no trade likely to bring it back. I think it would come from the\r\n     colonies where it was spent, directly to England; for I have always\r\n     observed that in every colony the more plenty the means of\r\n     remittance to England, the more goods are sent for, and the more\r\n     trade with England carried on.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What may be the amount of one year's imports into Pennsylvania\r\n     from Britain?\r\n\r\n     A.--I have been informed that our merchants compute the imports\r\n     from Britain to be above £500,000.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What may be the amount of the produce of your province exported\r\n     to Britain?\r\n\r\n     A.--It must be small, as we produce little that is wanted in\r\n     Britain. I suppose it cannot exceed £40,000.\r\n\r\n     Q.--How then do you pay the balance?\r\n\r\n     A.--The balance is paid by our produce carried to the West Indies,\r\n     and sold in our own island, or to the French, Spaniards, Danes and\r\n     Dutch; by the same carried to other colonies in North America, as\r\n     to New England, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina and Georgia; by\r\n     the same carried to different parts of Europe, as Spain, Portugal\r\n     and Italy. In all which places we receive either money, bills of\r\n     exchange, or commodities that suit for remittance to Britain; which\r\n     together with all the profits on the industry of our merchants and\r\n     mariners, arising in those circuitous voyages, and the freights\r\n     made by their ships, centre finally in Britain to discharge the\r\n     balance, and pay for British manufactures continually used in the\r\n     province, or sold to foreigners by our traders.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Do you think it right that America should be protected by this\r\n     country and pay no part of the expense?\r\n\r\n     A.--That is not the case. The colonies raised, clothed, and paid,\r\n     during the last war, nearly 25,000 men, and spent many millions.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Were not you reimbursed by Parliament?\r\n\r\n     A.--We were only reimbursed what, in your opinion, we had advanced\r\n     beyond our proportion, or beyond what might reasonably be expected\r\n     from us; and it was a very small part of what we spent.\r\n     Pennsylvania, in particular, disbursed about £500,000, and the\r\n     reimbursements in the whole did not exceed £60,000.\r\n\r\n     Q.--You have said that you pay heavy taxes in Pennsylvania; what do\r\n     they amount to in the pound?\r\n\r\n     A.--The tax on all estates, real and personal, to eighteen-pence in\r\n     the pound, fully rated; and the tax on the profits of trades and\r\n     professions, with other taxes, do, I suppose, make full\r\n     half-a-crown in the pound.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Do you not think the people of America would submit to pay the\r\n     stamp duty if it were moderated?\r\n\r\n     A.--No, never, unless compelled by the force of arms.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What was the temper of America towards Great Britain before the\r\n     year 1763?\r\n\r\n     A.--The best in the world. They submitted willingly to the\r\n     government of the Crown, and paid, in all their courts, obedience\r\n     to Acts of Parliament. Numerous as the people are in the several\r\n     old provinces, they cost you nothing in forts, citadels, garrisons,\r\n     or armies, to keep them in subjection. They were governed by this\r\n     country at the expense only of a little pen, ink and paper. They\r\n     were led by a thread. They had not only a respect, but an affection\r\n     for Great Britain, for its laws, its customs and manners, and even\r\n     a fondness for its fashions, that greatly increased the commerce.\r\n     Natives of Britain were always treated with particular regard; to\r\n     be an Old-Englandman was of itself a character of some respect, and\r\n     gave a kind of rank among us.\r\n\r\n     Q.--And what is their temper now?\r\n\r\n     A.--Oh! very much altered.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Did you ever hear the authority of Parliament to make laws for\r\n     America questioned till lately?\r\n\r\n     A.--The authority of Parliament was allowed to be valid in all\r\n     laws, except such as should levy internal taxes. It was never\r\n     disputed in levying duties to regulate commerce.\r\n\r\n     Q.--In what light did the people of America use to consider the\r\n     Parliament of Great Britain?\r\n\r\n     A.--They considered the Parliament as the great bulwark and\r\n     security of their liberties and privileges, and always spoke of it\r\n     with the utmost respect and veneration. Arbitrary ministers, they\r\n     thought, might possibly at times attempt to oppress them; but they\r\n     relied on it, that the Parliament on application would always give\r\n     redress. They remembered with gratitude a strong instance of this,\r\n     when a Bill was brought into Parliament, with a clause to make\r\n     royal instructions laws in the colonies, which the House of Commons\r\n     would not pass, and it was thrown out.\r\n\r\n     Q.--And have they not still the same respect for Parliament?\r\n\r\n     A.--No; it is greatly lessened.\r\n\r\n     Q.--To what causes is that owing?\r\n\r\n     A.--To a concurrence of causes; the restraints lately laid on their\r\n     trade by which the bringing of foreign gold and silver into the\r\n     colonies was prevented; the prohibition of making paper money among\r\n     themselves, and then demanding a new and heavy tax by stamps;\r\n     taking away at the same time trial by juries, and refusing to see\r\n     and hear their humble petitions.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Don't you think they would submit to the Stamp Act if it was\r\n     modified, the obnoxious parts taken out, and the duty reduced to\r\n     some particulars of small moment?\r\n\r\n     A.--No; they will never submit to it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What is your opinion of a future tax, imposed on the same\r\n     principle of that of the Stamp Act; how would the Americans receive\r\n     it?\r\n\r\n     A.--Just as they do this. They would not pay it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Have not you heard of the resolutions of this House, and of the\r\n     House of Lords, asserting the right of Parliament relating to\r\n     America, including a power to tax the people there?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes; I have heard of such resolutions.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What will be the opinion of the Americans on those resolutions?\r\n\r\n     A.--They will think them unconstitutional and unjust.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Was it an opinion in America before 1763, that the Parliament\r\n     had no right to levy taxes and duties there?\r\n\r\n     A.--I never heard any objection to the right of levying duties to\r\n     regulate commerce; but a right to levy internal taxes was never\r\n     supposed to be in Parliament, as we are not represented there.\r\n\r\n     Q.--You say the colonies have always submitted to external taxes,\r\n     and object to the right of Parliament only in levying internal\r\n     taxes; now, can you show that there is any kind of difference\r\n     between the two taxes to the colony on which they may be laid?\r\n\r\n     A.--I think the difference is very great. An external tax is a duty\r\n     levied on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first\r\n     cost, and other charges on the commodity, and when it is offered\r\n     for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it\r\n     at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But\r\n     an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent, if\r\n     not levied by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we\r\n     shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each\r\n     other, neither purchase, nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall\r\n     neither marry nor make our wills unless we pay such and such sums,\r\n     and thus it is intended to extort our money from us, or ruin us by\r\n     the consequences of refusing to pay it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But supposing the internal tax or duty to be levied on the\r\n     necessaries of life imported into your colony, will not that be the\r\n     same thing in its effects as an internal tax?\r\n\r\n     A.--I do not know a single article imported into the northern\r\n     colonies, but what they can either do without or make themselves.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Don't you think cloth from England absolutely necessary to\r\n     them?\r\n\r\n     A.--No, by no means absolutely necessary; with industry and good\r\n     management, they may very well supply themselves with all they\r\n     want.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Considering the resolution of Parliament as to the right, do\r\n     you think, if the Stamp Act is repealed, that the North Americans\r\n     will be satisfied?\r\n\r\n     A.--I believe they will.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Why do you think so?\r\n\r\n     A.--I think the resolutions of right will give them very little\r\n     concern, if they are never attempted to be carried into practice.\r\n     The colonies will probably consider themselves in the same\r\n     situation in that respect with Ireland; they know you claim the\r\n     same right with regard to Ireland, but you never exercise it. And\r\n     they may believe you never will exercise it in the colonies, any\r\n     more than in Ireland, unless on some very extraordinary occasion.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But who are to be the judges of that extraordinary occasion? Is\r\n     not the Parliament?\r\n\r\n     A.--Though the Parliament may judge of the occasion, the people\r\n     will think it can never exercise such right till representatives\r\n     from the colonies are admitted into Parliament, and that, whenever\r\n     the occasion arises, representatives will be ordered.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Did the Americans ever dispute the controlling power of\r\n     Parliament to regulate the commerce?\r\n\r\n     A.--No.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Can anything less than a military force carry the Stamp Act\r\n     into execution??\r\n\r\n     A.--I do not see how a military force can be applied to that\r\n     purpose.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Why may it not?\r\n\r\n     A.--Suppose a military force sent into America, they will find\r\n     nobody in arms; what are they then to do? They cannot force a man\r\n     to take stamps, who refuses to do without them. They will not find\r\n     a rebellion; they may indeed make one.\r\n\r\n     Q.--If the Act is not repealed, what do you think will be the\r\n     consequences?\r\n\r\n     A.--A total loss of the respect and affection the people of America\r\n     bear to this country, and of all the commerce that depends on that\r\n     respect and affection.\r\n\r\n     Q.--How can the commerce be affected?\r\n\r\n     A.--You will find that, if the Act is not repealed, they will take\r\n     very little of your manufactures in a short time.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Is it in their power to do without them?\r\n\r\n     A.--I think they may very well do without them.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Is it their interest not to take them?\r\n\r\n     A.--The goods they take from Britain are either necessaries, mere\r\n     conveniences, or superfluities. The first, as cloth, etc., with a\r\n     little industry they can make at home; the second they can do\r\n     without, till they are able to provide them among themselves; and\r\n     the last, which are much the greatest part, they will strike off\r\n     immediately. They are mere articles of fashion, purchased and\r\n     consumed because the fashion in a respected country, but will now\r\n     be detested and rejected. The people have already struck off, by\r\n     general agreement, the use of all goods fashionable in mournings,\r\n     and many thousand pounds worth are sent back as unsaleable.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Suppose an Act of internal regulations connected with a tax,\r\n     how would they receive it?\r\n\r\n     A.--I think it would be objected to.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Then no regulation with a tax would be submitted to?\r\n\r\n     A.--Their opinion is, that when aids to the Crown are wanted, they\r\n     are to be asked of the several Assemblies, according to the\r\n     old-established usage, who will, as they always have done, grant\r\n     them freely; and that their money ought not to be given away\r\n     without their consent by persons at a distance, unacquainted with\r\n     their circumstances and abilities. The granting aids to the Crown\r\n     is the only means they have of recommending themselves to their\r\n     Sovereign, and they think it extremely hard and unjust that a body\r\n     of men, in which they have no representation, should make a merit\r\n     to itself of giving and granting what is not its own, but theirs,\r\n     and deprive them of a right they esteem of the utmost value and\r\n     importance, as it is the security of all their other rights.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But is not the post-office, which they have long received, a\r\n     tax as well as a regulation?\r\n\r\n     A.--No; the money paid for the postage of a letter is not of the\r\n     nature of a tax; it is merely a _quantum meruit_ for a service\r\n     done; no person is compellable to pay the money if he does not\r\n     choose to receive the service. A man may still, as before the Act,\r\n     send his letter by a servant, a special messenger, or a friend, if\r\n     he thinks it cheaper and safer.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But do they not consider the regulations of the post-office, by\r\n     the Act of last year, as a tax?\r\n\r\n     A.--By the regulations of last year, the rate of postage was\r\n     generally abated near thirty per cent. through all America; they\r\n     certainly cannot consider such abatement as a tax.\r\n\r\n     Q.--If an excise was laid by Parliament, which they might likewise\r\n     avoid paying, by not consuming the articles excised, would they\r\n     then object to it?\r\n\r\n     A.--They would certainly object to it, as an excise is unconnected\r\n     with any service done, and is merely an aid which they think ought\r\n     to be asked of them, and granted by them if they are to pay it, and\r\n     can be granted for them by no others whatsoever, whom they have not\r\n     empowered for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     Q.--You say they do not object to the right of Parliament in\r\n     levying duties on goods to be paid on their importation; now, is\r\n     there any kind of difference between a duty on the importation of\r\n     goods and an excise on their consumption?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes, a very material one; an excise, for the reasons I have\r\n     just mentioned, they think you can have no right to levy within\r\n     their country. But the sea is yours; you maintain by your fleets\r\n     the safety of navigation in it, and keep it clear of pirates; you\r\n     may have therefore a natural and equitable right to some toll or\r\n     duty on merchandise carried through that part of your dominions,\r\n     towards defraying the expense you are at in ships to maintain the\r\n     safety of that carriage.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Supposing the Stamp Act continued and was enforced, do you\r\n     imagine that ill-humour will induce the Americans to give as much\r\n     for worse manufactures of their own, and use them preferably to\r\n     better ones of yours?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes, I think so. People will pay as freely to gratify one\r\n     passion as another--their resentment as their pride.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What do you think a sufficient military force to protect the\r\n     distribution of the stamps in every part of America?\r\n\r\n     A.--A very great force; I can't say what, if the disposition of\r\n     America is for a general resistance.\r\n\r\n     Q.--If the Stamp Act should be repealed, would not the Americans\r\n     think they could oblige the Parliament to repeal every external tax\r\n     law now in force?\r\n\r\n     A.--It is hard to answer questions of what people at such a\r\n     distance will think.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But what do you imagine they will think were the motives of\r\n     repealing the Act?\r\n\r\n     A.--I suppose they will think that it was repealed from a\r\n     conviction of its inexpediency; and they will rely upon it that,\r\n     while the same expediency subsists, you will never attempt to make\r\n     such another.\r\n\r\n     Q--What do you mean by its inexpediency?\r\n\r\n     A.--I mean its inexpediency on several accounts: the poverty and\r\n     inability of those who were to pay the tax, the general discontent\r\n     it has occasioned, and the impracticability of enforcing it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--If the Act should be repealed, and the Legislature should show\r\n     its resentment to the opposers of the Stamp Act, would the colonies\r\n     acquiesce in the authority of the Legislature? What is your opinion\r\n     they would do?\r\n\r\n     A.--I don't doubt at all that if the Legislature repeal the Stamp\r\n     Act, the colonies will acquiesce in the authority.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But if the Legislature should think fit to ascertain its right\r\n     to levy taxes, by any Act levying a small tax, contrary to their\r\n     opinion, would they submit to pay the tax?\r\n\r\n     A.--The proceedings of the people in America have been considered\r\n     too much together. The proceedings of the Assemblies have been very\r\n     different from those of the mobs, and should be distinguished, as\r\n     having no connection with each other. The Assemblies have only\r\n     peaceably resolved what they take to be their rights; they have\r\n     taken no measures for opposition by force; they have not built a\r\n     fort, raised a man, or provided a grain of ammunition in order to\r\n     such opposition. The ringleaders of riots they think ought to be\r\n     punished; they would punish them themselves if they could. Every\r\n     sober, sensible man would wish to see rioters punished, as\r\n     otherwise peaceable people have no security of person or estate.\r\n     But as to an internal tax, how small soever, levied by the\r\n     Legislature here on the people there, while they have no\r\n     representatives in this Legislature, I think it will never be\r\n     submitted to. They will oppose it to the last. They do not consider\r\n     it as at all necessary for you to raise money on them by your\r\n     taxes, because they are, and always have been, ready to raise money\r\n     by taxes among themselves, and to grant large sums, equal to their\r\n     abilities, upon requisition from the Crown. They have not only\r\n     granted equal to their abilities, but during all the last war they\r\n     granted far beyond their abilities, and beyond their proportion\r\n     with this country, you yourselves being judges, to the amount of\r\n     many hundred thousand pounds; and this they did freely and readily,\r\n     only on a sort of promise from the Secretary of State that it\r\n     should be recommended to Parliament to make them compensation. It\r\n     was accordingly recommended to Parliament, in the most honourable\r\n     manner, for them. America has been greatly misrepresented and\r\n     abused here, in papers and pamphlets and speeches, as ungrateful,\r\n     unreasonable, and unjust in having put this nation to immense\r\n     expense for their defence, and refusing to bear any part of that\r\n     expense. The colonies raised, paid, and clothed near 25,000 men\r\n     during the last war--a number equal to those sent from Britain, and\r\n     far beyond their proportion; they went deeply into debt in doing\r\n     this, and all their taxes and estates are mortgaged, for many years\r\n     to come, for discharging that debt. The Government here was at that\r\n     time very sensible of this. The colonies were recommended to\r\n     Parliament. Every year the King sent down to the House a written\r\n     message to this purport: That his Majesty, being highly sensible of\r\n     the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects in North\r\n     America had exerted themselves in defence of his Majesty's just\r\n     rights and possessions, recommended it to the House to take the\r\n     same into consideration, and enable him to give them a proper\r\n     compensation. You will find those messages on your journals every\r\n     year of the war to the very last, and you did accordingly give\r\n     £200,000 annually to the Crown, to be distributed in such\r\n     compensation to the colonies. This is the strongest of all proofs\r\n     that the colonies, far from being unwilling to bear a share of the\r\n     burden, did exceed their proportion; for if they had done less, or\r\n     had only equalled their proportion, there would have been no room\r\n     or reason for compensation. Indeed, the sums reimbursed them were\r\n     by no means adequate to the expense they incurred beyond their\r\n     proportion; but they never murmured at that: they esteemed their\r\n     Sovereign's approbation of their zeal and fidelity, and the\r\n     approbation of this House, far beyond any other kind of\r\n     compensation; therefore there was no occasion for this Act to force\r\n     money from an unwilling people. They had not refused giving money\r\n     for the purposes of the Act; no requisition had been made; they\r\n     were always willing and ready to do what could reasonably be\r\n     expected from them, and in this light they wish to be considered.\r\n\r\n     Q.--But suppose Great Britain should be engaged in a war in Europe,\r\n     would North America contribute to the support of it?\r\n\r\n     A.--I do think they would, as far as their circumstances would\r\n     permit. They consider themselves as a part of the British empire,\r\n     and as having one common interest with it; they may be looked on\r\n     here as foreigners, but they do not consider themselves as such.\r\n     They are zealous for the honour and prosperity of this nation, and,\r\n     while they are well used, will always be ready to support it, as\r\n     far as their little power goes.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Do you think the Assemblies have a right to levy money on the\r\n     subject there, to grant to the Crown?\r\n\r\n     A.--I certainly think so; they have always done it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Would they do this for a British concern; as, suppose, a war in\r\n     some part of Europe that did not affect them?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes, for anything that concerned the general interest. They\r\n     consider themselves as a part of the whole.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What is the usual constitutional manner of calling on the\r\n     colonies for aids?\r\n\r\n     A.--A letter from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Is this all you mean--a letter from the Secretary of State?\r\n\r\n     A.--I mean the usual way of requisition--in a circular letter from\r\n     the Secretary of State, by his Majesty's command, reciting the\r\n     occasion, and recommending it to the colonies to grant such aids as\r\n     became their royalty and were suitable to their abilities.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Did the Secretary of State ever write for money for the Crown?\r\n\r\n     A.--The requisitions have been to raise, clothe, and pay men, which\r\n     cannot be done without money.\r\n\r\n     Q.--Would they grant money alone if called on?\r\n\r\n     A.--In my opinion they would, money as well as men, when they have\r\n     money or can make it.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What used to be the pride of the Americans?\r\n\r\n     A.--To indulge in the fashions and manufactures of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     Q.--What is now their pride?\r\n\r\n     A.--To wear their old clothes over again, till they can make new\r\n     ones.[282]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: \"An American revenue was, in England, a very popular\r\nmeasure. The cry in favour of it was so strong as to silence the voice\r\nof petitions to the contrary. The equity of compelling the Americans to\r\ncontribute to the common expenses of the empire satisfied many, who,\r\nwithout inquiring into the policy or justice of taxing their\r\nunrepresented fellow-subjects, readily assented to the measures adopted\r\nby Parliament for that purpose. The prospect of easing their own burdens\r\nat the expense of the colonists, dazzled the eyes of gentlemen of landed\r\ninterest, so as to keep out of their view the probable consequences of\r\nthe innovation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The disposition to tax the colonies was also strengthened by\r\nexaggerated accounts of their wealth. It was said that the American\r\nplanters lived in affluence and with inconsiderable taxes; while the\r\ninhabitants of Great Britain were borne down by such aggressive burdens\r\nas to make a bare existence a matter of extreme difficulty. The officers\r\nwho had served in America during the late war contributed to this\r\ndelusion. Their observations were founded on what they had seen in the\r\ncities, and at a time when large sums were spent by Government in\r\nsupport of fleets and armies, and when American commodities were in\r\ngreat demand. To treat with attention those who came to fight for them,\r\nand also to gratify their own pride, the colonists had made a parade of\r\ntheir riches, by frequently and sumptuously entertaining the gentlemen\r\nof the British army. These, judging from what they saw, without\r\nconsidering the general state of the country, concurred in representing\r\nthe colonists as very able to contribute largely towards defraying the\r\ncommon expenses of the empire.\" (Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I.,\r\nChap. iii., pp. 332-335.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: Prior Documents, etc., p. 5.\r\n\r\n\"The taxes of Great Britain exceeded by £3,000,000 what they were in\r\n1754, before the war; yet the present object was only to make the\r\ncolonies maintain their own army. Besides the taxes on trade, which were\r\nimmediately to be imposed, Mr. Grenville gave notice in the House that\r\nit was his intention, in the next session, to bring in a Bill imposing\r\n_stamp duties_ in America; and the reasons for giving such notice were,\r\nbecause he understood some people entertained doubts of the power of\r\nParliament to impose internal taxes on the colonies, and because that,\r\nof all the schemes which had fallen under his consideration, he thought\r\na Stamp Act was the best. But he was not so wedded to it as to be\r\nunwilling to give it up for any one that might appear more eligible; or\r\nif the colonies themselves thought any other mode would be more\r\nexpedient, he should have no objection to come to it by Act of\r\nParliament. At that time the merits of the question were opened at\r\nlarge. The opponents of the Government were publicly called upon to\r\ndeny, if they thought it fitting, the right of the Legislature to impose\r\nany tax, internal or external, on the colonies; and not a single member\r\nventured to controvert the right. Upon a solemn question asked in a full\r\nHouse, there was not one negative.\" (Bancroft's History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. V., Chap. ix., pp. 186, 187.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: Mr. Grenville gave the year's notice apparently from\r\nmotives of kindness and courtesy to the colonies, \"in order that the\r\ncolonies might have time to offer a compensation for the revenues which\r\nsuch a tax might produce. Accordingly, when the agents of these colonies\r\nwaited upon him to thank him for this mark of his consideration, he told\r\nthem that he was ready to receive proposals from the colonies for any\r\nother tax that might be equivalent in its produce to the stamp tax,\r\nhinting withal that their principals would now have it in their power,\r\nby agreeing to this tax, to establish a precedent for their being\r\nconsulted (by the Ministry, we suppose) before any tax was imposed upon\r\nthem by Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Many persons at this side of the water, and perhaps the agents\r\nthemselves, looked upon this as a humane and generous proceeding. But\r\nthe colonies seemed to consider it as an affront rather than a\r\ncompliment. At least not one of them authorized its agent to consent to\r\nthe stamp duty, or to offer any compensation for it; and some of them\r\nwent so far as to send over petitions, to be presented to the King,\r\nLords, and Commons, positively and directly questioning the authority\r\nand jurisdiction of Parliament over their properties.\" (Annual Register,\r\nVol. VIII., Chap. ix., p. 33.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: See Appendix to this chapter for a summary and review of\r\nthe speeches of Mr. Charles Townsend and Colonel Barré.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: \"The province of Virginia took the lead. On the 29th May,\r\n1765, the House of Burgesses of Virginia adopted the following\r\nresolutions:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the honourable House of Commons in England have of late drawn\r\ninto question how far the General Assembly of this province hath power\r\nto enact laws for levying taxes and imposing duties payable by the\r\npeople of this his Majesty's most ancient colony; for settling and\r\nascertaining the same to all future times, the House of Burgesses of\r\nthis present General Assembly have come to the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n1. \"_Resolved_,--That the first adventurers and settlers of this his\r\nMajesty's colony and dominion of Virginia brought with them, and\r\ntransmitted to their posterity, and all other his Majesty's subjects\r\nsince inhabiting his Majesty's colony, all the privileges and immunities\r\nthat have at any time been held, enjoyed, and possessed by the people of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n2. \"_Resolved_,--That by the two Royal Charters granted by King James\r\nthe First, the colonies aforesaid are declared entitled to all\r\nprivileges of faithful liege and natural-born subjects, to all intents\r\nand purposes as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n3. \"_Resolved_,--That his Majesty's liege people of this most ancient\r\ncolony have enjoyed the right of having been thus far governed by their\r\nown Assembly in the article of taxes and internal police; and that the\r\nsame have never been forfeited, or in any other way yielded up, but have\r\nbeen constantly recognized by the King and people of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n4. \"_Resolved_, therefore,--That the General Assembly of this colony,\r\ntogether with his Majesty or his substitute, have, in their\r\nrepresentative capacity, the only exclusive right and power to levy\r\ntaxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of this colony; and that\r\nevery attempt to vest such power in any person or persons whatsoever\r\nother than the General Assembly aforesaid, is illegal, unconstitutional,\r\nand unjust, and has a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as\r\nAmerican freedom.\" (Prior Documents, etc., pp. 6, 7.)\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were introduced by Patrick Henry, in an eloquent and\r\nanimated speech, in the course of which the following extraordinary\r\nscene occurred: In an exciting tone he exclaimed, \"Cæsar had his Brutus!\r\nCharles the First had his Cromwell! and George the Third----\" The\r\nSpeaker, greatly excited, cried out \"Treason! treason!\" which was\r\nre-echoed from all sides. Then Henry, fixing his eye on the Speaker, and\r\npointing his finger towards him, raised his voice above the confusion\r\nand concluded, \"And George the Third may profit by their example. If\r\nthis be treason, make the most of it.\" (Elliott's History, etc., Vol.\r\nII., p. 252.)\r\n\r\nMr Bancroft says: \"The resolutions were published in the newspapers\r\nthroughout America, and by _men of all parties_--_by Royalists_ in\r\noffice not less than by the public bodies in the colonies--were received\r\nwithout dispute as the avowed sentiments of the 'Old Dominion.'\"\r\n(History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap, xiii., p. 278.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Holmes' Annals, Vol. II., page 135.

I can set them on; I can fetch them off again.\"\r\n(Rapin's History of England, Vol. IX., p. 410, in a note.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: \"On Sunday, 25th August (the day before these riots were\r\nrenewed), Dr. Mayhew preached in the west meeting house, from the text,\r\nGalatians, chap. v. verse 12: 'I would they were even cut off which\r\ntrouble you.' Although the sermon was regular enough, the text then\r\nseemed significant, and Hutchinson (History) states that some were\r\nexcited by it. (Doubtless the 'Band-dogs' of Dr. Mayhew.) At any rate,\r\nin the night the bonfires brought together their crowds, who, grown bold\r\nby success, proceeded to express their hatred against the Admiralty\r\nCourts and the Custom-houses by attacking and damaging the houses of two\r\nofficers, Story and Hallowell. In these they found good wines, which\r\nserved to inflame their blood; and then their shout was, 'Hutchinson!\r\nHutchinson!' A friend hastened to his house to warn him of his danger.\r\nHe barred his windows, determined to resist their fury; but his family\r\ndragged him away with them in their flight. The mob rushed on, and\r\nbeating down his windows, sacked the house (one of the finest in Boston)\r\nand destroyed everything, even a valuable collection of books and\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n\"This excess shocked the wise friends of liberty, and in a public\r\nmeeting the citizens discovered the destruction, and set their faces\r\nagainst any further demonstrations of the sort. Rewards were offered for\r\nthe rioters, and Mackintosh and some others were apprehended, but were\r\nrescued by their friends; and it was found impossible to proceed against\r\nthem.\" (Elliott's New England History, Vol. II., pp. 254, 255.)\r\n\r\n\"Mayhew sent the next day a special apology and disclaimer to\r\nHutchinson. The inhabitants of Boston, at a town meeting, unanimously\r\nexpressed their abhorrence of these proceedings, and a civil guard was\r\norganized to prevent their repetition. Yet the rioters, though well\r\nknown, went unpunished--a sure sign of the secret concurrence of the\r\nmass of the community. Those now committed were revolutionary acts,\r\ndesigned to intimidate--melancholy forerunners of civil war.\"\r\n(Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap, xxviii., p.\r\n528.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: _Ib._, p. 527.\r\n\r\n1. Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, whose house was thus sacked and his\r\nvaluable papers destroyed, was the historian of his native province of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, whom I have quoted so frequently in the present\r\nvolume of this history. Of his history, Mr. Bancroft, a bitter enemy of\r\nHutchinson's, says:\r\n\r\n\"At the opening of the year 1765, the people of New England were reading\r\nthe history of the first sixty years of the Colony of Massachusetts, by\r\nHutchinson. This work is so ably executed that as yet it remains without\r\na rival; and his knowledge was so extensive that, with the exception of\r\na few concealments, it exhausts the subject. Nothing so much revived the\r\nancestral spirit which a weaving of the gloomy superstitions, mixed with\r\nPuritanism, had for a long time overshadowed.\" (History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. V., Chap, xi., p. 228.)\r\n\r\n2. But though mob violence distinguished Boston on this as well as on\r\nother occasions, the opposition was such throughout the colonies, from\r\nNew Hampshire to Georgia, that all those who had been appointed to\r\nreceive and distribute the stamps were compelled, by the remonstrances\r\nand often threats of their fellow-colonists, to resign the office; and\r\nthe stamped paper sent from England to the ports of the various\r\nprovinces was either returned back by the vessel that brought it, or put\r\ninto a place of sate keeping. \"Though the Stamp Act was to have operated\r\nfrom the 1st of November, yet the legal proceedings in Courts were\r\ncarried on as before. Vessels entered and departed without stamped\r\npapers. The printers boldly printed and circulated their newspapers, and\r\nfound a sufficient number of readers, though they used common paper, in\r\ndefiance of the Act of Parliament. In most departments, by common\r\nconsent, business was carried on as though no stamp law existed. This\r\nwas accompanied by spirited resolutions to risk all consequences rather\r\nthan submit to use the paper required by the Stamp Act. While these\r\nmatters were in agitation, the colonists entered into associations\r\nagainst importing British manufactures till the Stamp Act should be\r\nrepealed. Agreeably to the free constitution of Great Britain, the\r\nsubject was at liberty to buy, or not to buy, as he pleased. By\r\nsuspending their future purchases until the repeal of the Stamp Act, the\r\ncolonists made it the interest of merchants and manufacturers in England\r\nto solicit its repeal. They had usually taken so great a proportion of\r\nBritish manufactures, amounting annually to two or three millions\r\nsterling, that they threw some thousands in the mother country out of\r\nemployment, and induced them, from a regard to their own interest, to\r\nadvocate the measures wished for by America.\" (Ramsay's Colonial\r\nHistory, Vol. I., pp. 345, 346).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: \"Petitions were received by Parliament from the merchants\r\nof London, Bristol, Lancaster, Liverpool, Hull, Glasgow, etc., and\r\nindeed from most of the trading and manufacturing towns and boroughs in\r\nthe kingdom. In these petitions they set forth the great decay of their\r\ntrade, owing to the laws and regulations made for America; the vast\r\nquantities of our manufactures (besides those articles imported from\r\nabroad, which were enclosed either with our own manufactures or with the\r\nproduce of our colonies) which the American trade formerly took off our\r\nhands; by all which many thousand manufacturers, seamen, and labourers\r\nhad been employed, to the very great and increasing benefit of the\r\nnation. That in return for these exports the petitioners had received\r\nfrom the colonies rice, indigo, tobacco, naval stores, oil, whale-fins,\r\nfurs, and lately potash, with other staple commodities, besides a large\r\nbalance of remittances by bills of exchange and bullion obtained by the\r\ncolonists for articles of their produce, not required for the British\r\nmarket, and therefore exported to other places.\r\n\r\n\"That from the nature of this trade, consisting of British manufactures\r\nexported, and of the import of raw material from America, many of them\r\nused in our manufactures, and all of them tending to lessen our\r\ndependence on neighbouring states, it must be deemed of the highest\r\nimportance in the commercial system of this nation. That this commerce,\r\nso beneficial to the state, and so necessary to the support of\r\nmultitudes, then lay under such difficulties and discouragements, that\r\nnothing less than its utter ruin was apprehended without the immediate\r\ninterposition of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"That the colonies were then indebted to the merchants of Great Britain\r\nto the sum of several millions sterling; and that when pressed for\r\npayment, they appeal to past experience in proof of their willingness;\r\nbut declare it is not in their power at present to make good their\r\nengagements, alleging that the taxes and restrictions laid upon them,\r\nand the extension of the jurisdiction of the Vice-Admiralty Courts,\r\nestablished by some late Acts of Parliament, particularly by an Act\r\npassed in the 4th year of his present Majesty, for granting certain\r\nduties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, and by an Act\r\npassed in the 5th year of his Majesty, for granting and applying certain\r\nstamp duties, etc., in said colonies, etc., with several regulations and\r\nrestraints, which, if founded in Acts of Parliament for defined\r\npurposes, they represent to have been extended in such a manner as to\r\ndisturb legal commerce and harass the fair trader, and to have so far\r\ninterrupted the usual, former and most useful branches of their\r\ncommerce, restrained the sale of their produce, thrown the state of the\r\nseveral provinces into confusion, and brought on so great a number of\r\nactual bankruptcies that the former opportunities and means of\r\nremittances and payments were utterly lost and taken from them.\r\n\r\n\"That the petitioners were, by these unhappy events, reduced to the\r\nnecessity of applying to the House, in order to secure themselves and\r\ntheir families from impending ruin; to prevent a multitude of\r\nmanufacturers from becoming a burden to the community, or else seeking\r\ntheir bread in other countries, to the irretrievable loss of the\r\nkingdom; and to preserve the strength of this nation entire, its\r\ncommerce flourishing, the revenues increasing, our navigation the\r\nbulwark of the kingdom, in a state of growth and extension, and the\r\ncolonies, from inclination, duty, and interest, attached to the mother\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a number of petitions from every part of the kingdom, pregnant\r\nwith so many interesting facts, stated and attested by such numbers of\r\npeople, whose lives had been entirely devoted to trade, and who must be\r\nnaturally supposed to be competent judges of a subject which they had so\r\nlong and so closely attended to (besides that it showed the general\r\nsense of the nation), could not fail of having great weight with the\r\nHouse.\" (Annual Register for 1766, Vol. IX., Chap, vii., pp. 35, 36.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., p. 348.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time that the Stamp Act was repealed, the absolute and\r\nunlimited supremacy of Parliament was, in words, asserted. The opposers\r\nof repeal contended for this as essential. The friends of that measure\r\nacquiesced in it, to strengthen their party and make sure of their\r\nobject. Many of both sides thought that the dignity of Great Britain\r\nrequired something of the kind to counterbalance the loss of authority\r\nthat might result from her yielding to the clamours of the colonists.\r\nThe Act for this purpose was called the Declaratory Act, and was, in\r\nprinciple, more hostile to America's rights than the Stamp Act; for it\r\nannulled those resolutions and acts of the Provincial Assemblies in\r\nwhich they had asserted their right to exemption from all taxes not\r\nimposed by their own representatives; and also enacted that the King and\r\nParliament had, and of right ought to have, power to bind the colonies\r\nin all cases whatsoever.\"--_Ib._, p. 349.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: \"The aborigines were never formidable in battle until\r\nthey became supplied with the weapons of European invention.\"\r\n(Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. I., p. 401.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: The treatment of the Indians by the early New England\r\nPuritans is one of the darkest pages in English colonial history. I have\r\nslightly alluded to it in the preceding pages of this volume. Many\r\npassages might be selected from the early divines of New England,\r\nreferring to the Indians as the heathen whom they were to drive out of\r\nthe land which God had given to this Israel. I will confine myself to\r\nthe quotation of a few words from the late Rev. J.B. Marsden, A.M.,\r\nnoted for his Puritan partialities, in the two volumes of his _History\r\nof the Early and Later Puritans_. But his sense of Christian justice,\r\ntolerance, and humanity revolted at the New England Puritans'\r\nintolerance to each other, and their cruel treatment of the Indians. Mr.\r\nMarsden says:\r\n\r\n\"The New England Puritans were revered beyond the Atlantic as the\r\nPilgrim Fathers, the founders of great cities, and of States renowned\r\nthrough the wide world for wealth, intelligence, and liberty. Their\r\nmemory is cherished in England with feelings of silent respect rather\r\nthan of unmixed admiration; for their inconsistencies were almost equal\r\nto their virtues; and here, while we respect their integrity, we are not\r\nblinded to their faults. A persecuted band themselves, they soon learned\r\nto persecute each other. The disciples of liberty, they confined its\r\nblessings to themselves. The loud champions of the freedom of\r\nconscience, they allowed no freedom which interfered with their narrow\r\nviews. Professing a mission of Gospel holiness, they fulfilled it but in\r\npart. When opposed, they were revengeful; when irritated, fanatical and\r\ncruel. In them a great experiment was to be tried, under conditions the\r\nmost favourable to its success; and it failed in its most important\r\npoint. The question to be solved was this: How would the Puritans, the\r\nhunted, persecuted Puritans behave, were they but once free, once at\r\nliberty to carry their principles into full effect? The answer was\r\nreturned from the shores of another world. It was distinct and\r\nunequivocal. And it was this: they were prepared to copy the worst vices\r\nof their English persecutors, and, untaught by experience, to imitate\r\ntheir worst mistakes. The severities of Whitgift seemed to be justified\r\nwhen it was made apparent on the plains of North America, that they had\r\nbeen inflicted upon men who wanted only the opportunity to inflict them\r\nagain, and inflict them on one another.\" (Marsden's History of the Early\r\nPuritans, Chap, xi., pp. 305, 306.)\r\n\r\nAfter referring to early conflicts between the Puritans and Indians, Mr.\r\nMarsden remarks as follows in regard to the manner in which the Puritans\r\ndestroyed the Pequod nation:\r\n\r\n\"If there be a justifiable cause of war, it surely must be this, when\r\nour territory is invaded and our means of existence threatened. That the\r\nIndians fell upon their enemies by the most nefarious stratagems, or\r\nexposed them, when taken in war, to cruel torments (though such ferocity\r\nis not alleged in this instance), does not much affect the question.\r\nThey were savages, and fought white men as they and their fathers had\r\nalways fought each other. How then should a community of Christian men\r\nhave dealt with them? Were they to contend as savages or civilized men?\r\nAs civilized men, or rather as men who had forsaken a land of\r\ncivilization for purer abodes of piety and peace? The Pequod war shows\r\nhow little their piety could be trusted when their passions were\r\naroused.\"\r\n\r\n\"After a week's marching, they came at day-break on the Indian wigwams\r\nand immediately assaulted them. The 'massacre' (so their own chronicler,\r\nMr. Bancroft, has termed it) spread from one hut to another; for the\r\nIndians were asleep and unarmed. But the work of slaughter was too slow.\r\n'We must burn them,' exclaimed the fanatic chieftain of the Puritans;\r\nand he cast the first firebrand to windward among their wigwams. In an\r\ninstant the encampment was in a blaze. Not a soul escaped. Six hundred\r\nIndians, men, women, and children, perished by the steady hand of the\r\nmarksman, by the unresisted broadsword, and by the hideous\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\n\"The work of revenge was not yet accomplished. In a few days a fresh\r\nbody of troops arrived from Massachusetts, accompanied by their\r\nminister, Wilson. The remnants of the proscribed race were now hunted\r\ndown in their hiding places; every wigwam was burned; every settlement\r\nbroken up; every cornfield laid waste. There remained, says their\r\nexulting historian, not a man or a woman, not a warrior or child of the\r\nPequod name. A nation had disappeared from the family of men.\" \"History\r\nrecords many deeds of blood equal in ferocity to this; but we shall seek\r\nin vain for a parallel to the massacre of the Pequod Indians. It brought\r\nout the worst points in the Puritan character, and displayed it in the\r\nstrongest light. When their passions were once inflamed, their religion\r\nitself was cruelty. A dark, fanatical spirit of revenge took possession,\r\nnot, as in other men, by first expelling every religious and every human\r\nconsideration, but, what was infinitely more terrible, by calling to its\r\naid every stimulant, every motive that religion, jaundiced and\r\nperverted, could supply. It is terrible to read, when cities are\r\nstormed, of children thrown into the flames, and shrieking women\r\nbutchered by infuriated men who have burst the restraints of discipline.\r\nIt is a dreadful licence; and true and gallant soldiers, occur when it\r\nmay, feel that their profession is disgraced. But this was worse. Here\r\nall was deliberately calm; all was sanctioned by religion. It was no\r\noutbreak of mere brutality. The fast was kept; the Sabbath was observed;\r\nthe staff of office, as a sacred ensign, was consecrated by one\r\nChristian minister, while another attended upon the marching of\r\nsoldiery, and cheered them in the murderous design with his presence and\r\nhis prayers. Piety was supposed not to abhor, but to exult in the\r\nexploit. This was true fanaticism. God's word and ordinances were made\r\nsubservient to the greatest crimes. They were rudely forced and\r\nviolated, and made the ministers of sin. When the assailants, reeking\r\nfrom the slaughter and blackened with the smoke, returned home, they\r\nwere everywhere received with a pious ovation. God was devoutly praised,\r\nbecause the first principles of justice, nay, the stinted humanities of\r\nwar, had been outraged, and unresisting savages, with their wives and\r\nchildren, had been ferociously destroyed.\" (Marsden's History of the\r\nEarly Puritans, Chap, xi., pp. 305-311.)\r\n\r\nSuch was the early Puritan method of fulfilling the Royal Charter to the\r\nMassachusetts Company of \"Christianizing and civilizing the idolatrous\r\nIndians;\" and such is a practical comment upon Colonel Barré's statement\r\nas to Indian cruelties.\r\n\r\nBut the intolerance of the Puritans to each other was as conspicuous as\r\ntheir cruel treatment of the Indians. On this point Mr. Marsden adds:\r\n\r\n\"The intolerance with which the Puritans had been treated at home might\r\nat least have taught them a lesson of forbearance to each other. But it\r\nhad no such effect. It would almost seem as if, true disciples in the\r\nschool of the High Commission and Star Chamber, their ambition was to\r\nexcel their former tyrants in the art of persecution. They imitated,\r\nwith a pertinacious accuracy, the bad examples of their worst\r\noppressors; and with far less to excuse them, repeated in America the\r\nself-same crimes from which they and their fathers had suffered so much\r\nin England. No political considerations of real importance, no ancient\r\nprejudices interwoven with the framework of society, could be pleaded\r\nhere. Their institutions were new, their course was hampered by no\r\nprecedents. Imagination cannot suggest a state of things more favourable\r\nto the easy, safe, and sure development of their views. Had they\r\ncherished a catholic spirit, there was nothing to prevent the exercise\r\nof the most enlarged beneficence. Their choice was made freely, and they\r\ndecided in favour of intolerance; and their fault was aggravated by the\r\nconsideration that the experiment had been tried, and that they\r\nthemselves were the living witnesses of its folly.\" (Marsden's History\r\nof the Early Puritans, p. 311.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: It was but just to have added that the trade between\r\nEngland and America was as profitable to America as it was to England,\r\nand that the value of property and rents advanced more rapidly in\r\nAmerica than in England.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: This is a withering rebuke to a conceited though clever\r\nyoung statesman, Lord Nugent, who, in a previous part of the debate,\r\ninsisted that the honour and dignity of the kingdom obligated them to\r\ncompel the execution of the Stamp Act, \"unless the right was\r\nacknowledged and the repeal solicited as a favour,\" concluding with the\r\nremark that \"a peppercorn, in acknowledgment of the right, is of more\r\nvalue than millions without.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap.\r\nxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap. xxi., pp.\r\n397, 398.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: Prior Documents, pp. 64-81.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT OVER THE BRITISH COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with a summary statement of events which followed the\r\nrepeal of the Stamp Act, I think it proper to state the nature and\r\nextent of the authority of Parliament over the colonies, as interpreted\r\nby legislative bodies and statesmen on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr.\r\nBancroft well remarks:\r\n\r\n\"It is the glory of England that the rightfulness of the Stamp Act was\r\nin England itself a subject of dispute. It could have been so nowhere\r\nelse. The King of France taxed the French colonies as a matter of\r\ncourse; the King of Spain collected a revenue by his own will in Mexico\r\nand Peru, in Cuba and Porto Rico, and wherever he ruled. The\r\nStates-General of the Netherlands had no constitutional doubt about\r\nimposing duties on their outlying colonies. To England exclusively\r\nbelongs the honour that between her and her colonies the question of\r\nright could arise; it is still more to her glory, as well as to her\r\nhappiness and freedom, that in that contest her success was not\r\npossible. Her principles, her traditions, her liberty, her constitution,\r\nall forbade that arbitrary rule should become her characteristic. The\r\nshaft aimed at her new colonial policy was tipped with a feather from\r\nher own wing.\"[283]\r\n\r\nIn the dispute which took place in 1757 between the Legislative Assembly\r\nof Massachusetts and the Earl of Loudoun as to the extension of the\r\nMutiny Act to the colonies, and the passing of an Act by the local\r\nLegislature for the billeting of the troops, as similar in its\r\nprovisions as possible to those of the Mutiny Act--so that it was\r\naccepted by the Earl of Loudoun--the Massachusetts Assembly vindicated\r\ntheir motives for denying the application of the Mutiny Act to the\r\ncolonies, and for providing quarters for the military by an Act of their\r\nown, yet recognizing the legitimate authority of Parliament, in a\r\nmessage to Governor Barnard containing the following words:\r\n\r\n\"We wish to stand perfectly right with his lordship (the Earl of\r\nLoudoun), and it will be a great satisfaction to us if we may be able to\r\nremove his misapprehension of the spring and motives of our proceedings.\r\nHis lordship is pleased to say that we seem willing to enter into a\r\ndispute upon the necessity of a provincial law to enforce a British Act\r\nof Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"We are utterly ignorant as to what part of our conduct could give\r\noccasion for this expression. The point in which we were obliged to\r\ndiffer from his lordship was the extent of the provision made by Act of\r\nParliament for regulating quarters. We thought it did not reach the\r\ncolonies. _Had we thought it did reach us, and yet made an Act of our\r\nown to enforce it, there would have been good grounds for his lordships\r\nexception_; but being fully persuaded that the provision was never\r\nintended for us, what better step could we take than, agreeable to the\r\ntwentieth section of the Articles of War, to regulate quarters as the\r\ncircumstances of the province require, but still as similar to the\r\nprovisions made in England as possible? And how can it be inferred from\r\nthence that we suppose a provincial Act necessary to enforce an Act of\r\nParliament?\r\n\r\n\"We are willing, by a due exercise of the powers of civil government\r\n(and we have the pleasure of seeing your Excellency concur with us), to\r\nremove, as much as may be, all pretence of necessity of military\r\ngovernment. Such measures, we are sure, will never be disapproved by the\r\nParliament of Great Britain, _our dependence upon which, we never had a\r\ndesire or thought of lessening_. From the knowledge your Excellency has\r\nacquired of us, you will be able to do us justice in this regard.\r\n\r\n\"In our message to your Excellency, which you transmitted to his\r\nlordship, we declared that the Act of Parliament, the extent of which\r\nwas then in dispute, as far as it related to the Plantations, had always\r\nbeen observed by us.\r\n\r\n\"_The authority of all Acts of Parliament which concern the colonies,\r\nand extend to them, is ever acknowledged in all the Courts of law, and\r\nmade the rule in all judicial proceedings in the province. There is not\r\na member of the General Court, we know no inhabitant within the bounds\r\nof the Government, that ever questioned this authority._\r\n\r\n\"_To prevent any ill consequences which may arise from an opinion of our\r\nholding such principles, we now utterly disavow them, as we should\r\nreadily have done at any time past if there had been occasion for it_;\r\nand we pray that his lordship may be acquainted therewith, that we may\r\nappear in a true light, and that no impressions may remain to our\r\ndisadvantage.\"[284]\r\n\r\nThis is a full and indefinite recognition of the supreme authority of\r\nParliament, even to the providing of accommodation for the soldiers; and\r\nsuch was the recognition of the authority of Parliament throughout the\r\ncolonies. \"It was generally allowed,\" says Dr. Ramsay, \"that as the\r\nplanting of colonies was not designed to erect an independent\r\nGovernment, but to extend an old one, the parent state had a right to\r\nrestrain their trade in every way which conduced to the common\r\nemolument. They for the most part considered the mother country as\r\nauthorized to name ports and nations to which alone their merchandise\r\nshould be carried, and with which alone they should trade; but the novel\r\nclaim of taxing them without their consent was universally reprobated as\r\ncontrary to their natural, chartered, and constitutional rights. In\r\nopposition to it, they not only alleged the general principles of\r\nliberty, but ancient usage. During the first hundred and fifty years of\r\ntheir existence they had been left to tax themselves and in their own\r\nway.\" \"In the war of 1755, the events of which were fresh in the\r\nrecollection of every one, the Parliament had in no instance attempted\r\nto raise either men or money in the colonies by its own authority. As\r\nthe claim of taxation on one side and the refusal on the other were the\r\nvery hinges on which the revolution turned they merit a particular\r\ndiscussion.\"[285]\r\n\r\nThe only exception to the authority of Parliament over the colonies was\r\nlevying _internal_ taxes. A marked distinction was made between\r\n_external_ and _internal_ taxes. It was admitted upon all hands that the\r\nParliament had the constitutional right to impose the former, but not\r\nthe latter. The Tory opposition in the British Parliament denied the\r\ndistinction between _external_ and _internal_ taxes, and maintained that\r\nif Parliament had the right to impose the one they had equally the right\r\nto impose the other; but the advocates of American rights maintained the\r\ndistinction between _external_ and _internal_ taxation; and also Dr.\r\nFranklin, in his evidence at the bar of the House of Commons, in\r\nFebruary, 1766, which I have quoted at length above, as the best\r\nexposition of the colonial side of the questions at issue between\r\nEngland and America. I will here reproduce two questions and answers on\r\nthe subject now under consideration:\r\n\r\nQ.--\"You say they do not object to the right of Parliament, in levying\r\nduties on goods, to be paid on their importation; now, is there any kind\r\nof difference between a duty on the importation of goods and an excise\r\non their consumption?\"\r\n\r\nA.--\"Yes, a very material one; an excise, for the reasons I have just\r\nmentioned, they think you can have no right to levy within their\r\ncountry. But the sea is yours; you maintain by your fleets the safety of\r\nnavigation in it, and keep it clear of pirates; you may have therefore a\r\nnatural and equitable right to some toll or duty on merchandise carried\r\nthrough that part of your dominions, towards defraying the expense you\r\nare at in ships to maintain the safety of that carriage.\"\r\n\r\nQ.--\"Does this reasoning hold in the case of a duty laid on the produce\r\nof their lands exported? And would they not then object to make a duty?\"\r\n\r\nA.--\"If it tended to make the produce so much dearer abroad as to lessen\r\nthe demand for it, to be sure they would object to such a duty; _not to\r\nyour right of levying it_, but they would complain of it as a burden,\r\nand petition you to lighten it.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in these words of Dr. Franklin there is the\r\nfullest recognition of the right of Parliament to impose duties on all\r\narticles imported into, or exported from, the colonies; the only\r\nexception was the levying direct or _internal_ taxes for the purposes of\r\nrevenue, the right to impose which was held, and we think justly held,\r\nto belong to the representative Legislatures elected by the colonists\r\nthemselves. Such also were the views of the two great statesmen, Pitt\r\nand Burke, who with such matchless eloquence advocated the rights of\r\nthe colonies--whose speeches have become household words in America, and\r\nare found in all their school books. Mr. Pitt, in a speech which I have\r\nquoted at length in a previous chapter, said expressly:\r\n\r\n\"Let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be\r\nasserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to\r\nevery point of legislation whatsoever, that we may bind their trade,\r\nconfine their manufactures, and exercise every power except that of\r\ntaking their money out of their pockets without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt therefore advocated the repeal of the Stamp Act with all his\r\nfiery eloquence and energy, saying that he rejoiced that the colonists\r\nhad resisted that Act--not by riots or force of arms, but by every\r\nconstitutional mode of resistance, in the expression of public opinion\r\nagainst an unjust and oppressive measure. Mr. Pitt's speech has been\r\nquoted by American writers, and inserted in American school books, to\r\njustify the resistance of America to England in the revolution which was\r\ndeclared in 1776; but his speech was delivered, and the Act against\r\nwhich it was delivered was repealed, ten years before. The United Empire\r\nLoyalists were as much opposed to the Stamp Act as any other colonists,\r\nand rejoiced as heartily at its repeal.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke was the appointed agent of the province of New York, and no\r\nmember of the House of Commons equalled him in the eloquent and\r\nelaborate advocacy of the popular rights of the colonies. Extracts from\r\nhis speeches have been circulated in every form, and in unnumbered\r\nrepetition in American periodicals and school books; but what he said as\r\nto the authority of Parliament over the colonies has not found so wide a\r\ncirculation in America. In advocating the repeal of the Stamp Act, in\r\nhis celebrated speech on _American taxation_, Mr. Burke said:\r\n\r\n\"What is to become of the Declaratory Act, asserting the entireness of\r\nBritish legislative authority, if we abandon the practice of taxation?\r\nFor my part, I look upon the rights stated in that Act exactly in the\r\nmanner in which I viewed them on its very first proposition, and which I\r\nhave often taken the liberty, with great humility, to lay before you. I\r\nlook, I say, on the imperial rights of Great Britain, and the privileges\r\nwhich the colonists ought to enjoy under those rights, to be just the\r\nmost reconcilable things in the world. The Parliament of Great Britain\r\nsits at the head of her extensive empire in two capacities: one, as the\r\nlocal Legislature of this island, providing for all things at home,\r\nimmediately, and by no other instrument than the executive power; the\r\nother, and I think her nobler capacity, is what I call her _imperial\r\ncharacter_, in which, as from the throne of heaven, she superintends all\r\nthe several inferior Legislatures, and guides and controls them all,\r\nwithout annihilating any. As all these Provincial Legislatures are only\r\nco-ordinate with each other, they ought all to be subordinate to her,\r\nelse they can neither preserve mutual peace, nor hope for mutual\r\njustice, nor effectually afford mutual assistance. It is necessary to\r\ncoerce the negligent, to restrain the violent, and to aid the weak and\r\ndeficient, by the overruling plenitude of its power. She is never to\r\nintrude into the place of the others while they are equal to the common\r\nends of their institution. But in order to enable Parliament to answer\r\nall these ends of provident and beneficent superintendence, her powers\r\nmust be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament\r\nlimited, may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the\r\nrequisitions are not obeyed? What! Shall there be no reserved power in\r\nthe empire to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and\r\ndissipate the whole? We are engaged in war; the Secretary of State calls\r\nupon the colonies to contribute; some would do it; I think most would\r\ncheerfully furnish whatever is demanded. One or two, suppose, hang back,\r\nand, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft be on the\r\nothers--surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, 'Tax\r\nyourselves for the common supply, or Parliament will do it for you.'\r\nThis backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania,\r\nfor some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some\r\ninternal dissensions in the colony. But whether the act were so, or\r\notherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent\r\nsovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever\r\nused in the first instance. This is what I meant when I have said at\r\nvarious times that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an\r\ninstrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.\"[286]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap, xx., pp.\r\n366, 367.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. III.,\r\nChap. i, pp. 65, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: Colonial History, Vol. I., pp. 327, 328.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Speech on American taxation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF EVENTS FROM THE REPEAL OF THE STAMP ACT, MARCH, 1766, TO THE\r\nEND OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe universal joy caused in both Great Britain and America by the repeal\r\nof the Stamp Act foreshadowed a new era of unity and co-operation\r\nbetween the mother country and the colonies. But though trade and\r\ncommerce resumed their activity, and mutual expressions of respect and\r\naffection characterized the correspondence, private and official,\r\nbetween England and America, the rejoicings of re-union were soon\r\nsilenced, and mutual confidence, if restored at all, soon yielded to\r\nmutual suspicion. The King regretted the repeal of the Stamp Act as \"a\r\nfatal compliance\" which had \"wounded the majesty\" of England, and\r\nplanted \"thorns under his own pillow.\" He soon found a pretext for\r\nridding himself of the Ministers who had influenced the Parliament, and\r\ncompelled himself to adopt and sanction that measure, and to surround\r\nhimself with Ministers, some of whom sympathized with the King in his\r\nregrets, and all of whom were prepared to compensate for the humiliation\r\nto America in the repeal of the Stamp Act, by imposing obligations and\r\ntaxes on the colonies in other forms, under the absolute authority of\r\nParliament affirmed in the Declaratory Act, and which the Americans had\r\nfondly regarded as a mere salve to English pride, and not intended for\r\nany practical purpose. Mr. Pitt had rested his opposition to the Stamp\r\nAct upon the distinction between _external_ and _internal_ taxes, as did\r\nDr. Franklin in his evidence at the bar of the House of Commons; the\r\nopposition and the protesting Lords denied the distinction; and when Dr.\r\nFranklin was asked--\r\n\r\n\"Does the distinction between internal and external taxes exist in the\r\nCharter?\" he answered: \"No, I believe not;\" and being asked, \"Then may\r\nthey not, by the same interpretation, object to the Parliament's right\r\nof external taxation?\" he answered: \"They never have hitherto. Many\r\narguments have been lately used here to show them that there is no\r\ndifference, and that if you have no right to tax them internally, you\r\nhave no right to tax them externally, or make any other law to bind\r\nthem. At present they do not reason so, but in time they may possibly be\r\nconvinced by these arguments.\"[287]\r\n\r\nI now proceed to give a summary statement of the events between Great\r\nBritain and the colonies which followed the repeal of the Stamp Act,\r\nMarch 19th, 1766.\r\n\r\nWithin ten days of its passing, the Act repealing the Stamp Act was\r\nofficially transmitted to America by General Conway,[288] then\r\nSecretary of State for America, who accompanied them with a circular to\r\nthe several Governors, in which, while he firmly insisted upon a proper\r\nreverence for the King's Government, endeavoured affectionately to allay\r\nthe discontents of the colonists. When the Governor of Virginia\r\ncommunicated this letter to the House of Burgesses, they unanimously\r\nvoted a statue to the King, and the Assembly of Massachusetts voted a\r\nletter of thanks to Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Grafton.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the circular letter to the several Governors,\r\ncounselling forgetfulness and oblivion as to the disorders and\r\ncontentions of the past, General Conway wrote a separate letter to\r\nGovernor Barnard, of Massachusetts, in which he said: \"Nothing will tend\r\nmore effectually to every conciliating purpose, and there is nothing,\r\ntherefore, I have in command more earnestly to require of you, than that\r\nyou should exert yourself in _recommending_ it strongly to the Assembly,\r\nthat full and ample compensation be made to those who, from the madness\r\nof the people, have suffered for their acts in deference to the British\r\nLegislature.\" This letter was but a _recommendation_, not a _command_ or\r\n_requisition_, to the Legislature, and seems to have been intended as an\r\ninstruction to Governor Barnard alone; but he, now indulging his\r\npersonal resentments as well as haughty spirit, represented the letter\r\nof General Conway as a _command_ and _requisition_ founded on \"justice\r\nand humanity,\" and that the authority from which it came ought to\r\npreclude all doubts about complying with it, adding, \"Both the business\r\nand the time are most critical--let me entreat you to recollect\r\nyourselves, and to consider well what you are about. Shall the private\r\ninterests, passions, or resentments of a few men deprive the whole\r\npeople of the great and manifold advantages which the favour and\r\nindulgence of their King and his Parliament are now preparing for them?\r\nSurely after _his Majesty's commands_ are known, the very persons who\r\nhave created the prejudices and prepossessions I now endeavour to combat\r\nwill be the first to remove them.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Stamp Act, which the Governor interpreted as\r\n\"prejudices and prepossessions which he now endeavoured to combat,\" had\r\nbeen justified by the King and Parliament themselves in rejecting it;\r\nand he thus continued to make enemies of those whom he might have easily\r\nconciliated and made friends. The Assembly answered him in an indignant\r\nand sarcastic tone, and charged him with having exceeded the authority\r\ngiven in Secretary Conway's letter; concluding in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"If this _recommendation_, which your Excellency terms a _requisition_,\r\nbe founded on so much justice and humanity that it cannot be\r\ncontroverted--if the _authority_ with which it is introduced should\r\npreclude all disputation about complying with it, we should be glad to\r\nknow what freedom we have in the case?\r\n\r\n\"In answer to the questions which your Excellency has proposed with\r\nseeming emotion, we beg leave to declare, that we will not suffer\r\nourselves to be in the least influenced by party animosities or domestic\r\nfeuds, let them exist where they may; that if we can possibly prevent\r\nit, this fine country shall never be ruined by any person; that it shall\r\nbe through no default of ours should this people be deprived of the\r\ngreat and manifest advantages which the favour and indulgence of our\r\nmost gracious Sovereign and his Parliament are even now providing for\r\nthem. On the contrary, that it shall ever be our highest ambition, as it\r\nis our duty, so to demean ourselves in public and in private life as\r\nshall most clearly demonstrate our loyalty and gratitude to the best of\r\nkings, and thereby recommend his people to further gracious marks of the\r\nroyal clemency and favour.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the rest of your Excellency's speech, we are constrained\r\nto observe, that the general air and style of it savours more of an act\r\nof grace and pardon than of a parliamentary address to the two Houses of\r\nAssembly; and we most sincerely wish your Excellency had been pleased to\r\nreserve it, _if needful_, for a proclamation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that fresh seed of animosity and hostility was sown between\r\nGovernor Barnard and the Massachusetts Assembly, and sown by the\r\nGovernor himself, and the growth of which he further promoted by\r\nrefusing to confirm the choice of Mr. Hancock, whom the Assembly had\r\nelected as their Speaker, and refused to sanction six of their\r\ntwenty-eight nominations to the Council, because they had not nominated\r\nthe four judges of the Supreme Court and the Crown officers. Hence the\r\nanimosity of their reply to his speech above quoted. But as the Governor\r\nhad, by the Charter, a veto on the election of Speaker and Councillors,\r\nthe Legislature submitted without a murmur.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of the session (six months after the Governor's speech\r\nupon the subject), the Assembly passed an Act granting compensation to\r\nthe sufferers by the late riots, the principal of whom were the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the Collector of Customs, and the appointed\r\nDistributor of Stamps. The Act was accompanied by a declaration that it\r\nwas a free gift of the Province, and not an acknowledgment of the\r\njustice of their claim; it also contained a provision of amnesty to the\r\nrioters. The Act was agreed to by the Council and assented to by the\r\nGovernor; but it was disallowed by the King on the advice of the English\r\nAttorney and Solicitor General, because, as alleged, it assumed an act\r\nof grace which it belonged to the King to bestow, through an act of\r\noblivion of the evils of those who had acted unlawfully in endeavouring\r\nto enforce the Stamp Act, which had been passed by the British\r\nParliament the same year. The Massachusetts Assembly ordered that their\r\ndebates should henceforth be open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of New York also passed an Act granting compensation to\r\nthose who had suffered a loss of property for their adherence to the\r\nStamp Act, but stated it to be a free gift.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of 1766, dissatisfaction and distrust were manifest in\r\nseveral colonies, and apprehensions of other encroachments by the\r\nBritish Parliament upon what they held to be their constitutional\r\nrights. Even the General Assembly of Virginia, which had in the spring\r\nsession voted a statue to the King, and an obelisk to Mr. Pitt and\r\nseveral other members of Parliament, postponed, in the December\r\nfollowing, the final consideration of the resolution until the next\r\nsession. The Virginia press said: \"The Americans are hasty in\r\nexpressing their gratitude, if the repeal of the Stamp Act is not, at\r\nleast, a tacit compact that Great Britain will never again tax us;\" and\r\nadvised the different Assemblies, without mentioning the proceedings of\r\nParliament, to enter upon their journals as strong declarations of their\r\nown rights as words could express.[289]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of New York met early in 1766, in the best spirit; voted to\r\nraise on Bowling Green an equestrian statue to the King, and a statue of\r\nWilliam Pitt--\"twice the preserver of his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the clause of the Mutiny or Billeting Act (passed in 1765, in the\r\nsame session in which the Stamp Act was passed), directing Colonial\r\nLegislatures to make specific contributions towards the support of the\r\narmy, placed New York, where the head-quarters were established, in the\r\ndilemma of submitting immediately and unconditionally to the authority\r\nof Parliament, or taking the lead in a new career of resistance. The\r\nrescript was in theory worse than the Stamp Act. For how could one\r\nlegislative body command what another legislative body should enact? And\r\nviewed as a tax it was unjust, for it threw all the burden of the colony\r\nwhere the troops chanced to be collected. The requisition of the\r\nGeneral, made through the Governor, 'agreeably to the Act of\r\nParliament,' was therefore declared to be unprecedented in its character\r\nand unreasonable in its amount; yet in the exercise of the right of free\r\ndeliberation, everything asked for was voted, except such articles as\r\nwere not provided in Europe for British troops which were in\r\nbarracks.\"[290]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: In the House of Lords, Lord Mansfield, replying to Lord\r\nCamden, said: \"The noble lord who quoted so much law, and denied the\r\nright of the Parliament of Great Britain to levy _internal_ taxes upon\r\nthe colonies, allowed at the same time that _restrictions upon trade and\r\nduties upon the ports were legal_. But I cannot see any real difference\r\nin this distinction; for I hold it to be true, that a tax laid in any\r\nplace is like a pebble falling into and making a circle in a lake, till\r\none circle produces and gives motion to another, and the whole\r\ncircumference is agitated from the centre. A tax on tobacco, either in\r\nthe ports of Virginia or London, is a duty laid upon the inland\r\nPlantations of Virginia, a hundred miles from the sea, wherever the\r\ntobacco grows.\" (Quoted in Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol.\r\nV., p. 411.)\r\n\r\nMr. Grenville argued in the same strain in the House of Commons; and the\r\nAmericans, as apt pupils, soon learned by such arguments to resist\r\n_external_ as they had successfully resisted _internal_ taxes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: General Conway, as leader of the House of Commons, moved\r\nthe resolution for the repeal of the Stamp Act, and also moved the\r\nresolution for the Declaratory Bill. Colonel Barré moved an amendment to\r\nstrike out from the resolution the words \"in all cases whatsoever.\" He\r\nwas seconded by Pitt, and sustained by Beckford. \"Only three men, or\r\nrather Pitt alone, 'debated strenuously the rights of America' against\r\nmore than as many hundred; and yet the House of Commons, half-conscious\r\nof the fatality of its decision, was so awed by the overhanging shadow\r\nof coming events that it seemed to shrink from pronouncing its opinion.\r\nEdmund Burke, eager to add glory as an orator to his just renown as an\r\nauthor, argued for England's right in such a manner that the strongest\r\nfriends of power declared his speech to have been 'far superior to that\r\nof every other speaker;' while Grenville, Yorke, and all the lawyers;\r\nthe temperate Richard Hussey, who yet was practically for humanity and\r\njustice; Blackstone, the commentator on the laws of England, who still\r\ndisliked internal taxation of America by Parliament, filled many hours\r\nwith solemn arguments for England's unlimited supremacy. They persuaded\r\none another, and the House, that the Charters which kings had granted\r\nwere, by the unbroken opinions of lawyers, from 1689, subordinate to the\r\ngood-will of the Houses of Parliament; that Parliament, for a stronger\r\nreason, had power to tax--a power which it had been proposed to exert in\r\n1713, while Harley was at the head of the Treasury, and again at the\r\nopening of the Seven Years' War.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"So the watches of the long winter's night wore away, and at about four\r\no'clock in the morning, when the question was called, less than ten\r\nvoices, some say five, or four, some said but three, spoke out in the\r\nminority; and the resolution passed for England's right to do what the\r\nTreasury pleased with three millions of freemen in America.\" (Bancroft's\r\nHistory of the United States., Vol. V., pp. 415-417.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: Allen's History of the American Revolution, Vol. I.,\r\nChap. v., p. 101.

To take off the edge\r\nfrom this bill, bounties were granted on the importation of lumber and\r\ntimber from the plantations; coffee of domestic growth was exempted from\r\nadditional duty; and iron was permitted to be carried to Ireland.\"\r\n(Barry's History of Massachusetts, Second Period, Chap. x., p. 295.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1767--A NEW PARLIAMENT--FIRST ACT AGAINST THE PROVINCE OF NEW\r\nYORK--BILLETING SOLDIERS ON THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new House of Commons was elected in 1766, less favourable to the\r\ncolonies than the preceding one; and one of the first acts of the new\r\nParliament was founded on the intelligence received from New York, that\r\nthe Assembly had refused to comply with all the requirements of the\r\nBilleting Act in providing for his Majesty's troops which had been\r\nquartered upon that province.[291]\r\n\r\nA Bill was introduced by Mr. Grenville, the object of which was to\r\nrestrain the Assembly and Council of New York from passing any Act until\r\nthey had complied with the requisitions of the Billeting Act. Though the\r\nBill was introduced by the leader of the opposition, it received the\r\ncountenance and support of Ministers (Pitt being Premier, though absent\r\nthrough illness), \"who regarded it as a measure at once dignified and\r\nforbearing.\" The Bill passed with little opposition; the Legislature of\r\nNew York was at once frightened into immediate compliance, though the\r\nfeeling with which it was done may be easily conceived. The effect,\r\nhowever, in other colonies, was not only to excite fears and\r\ndissatisfaction, but to call forth public expressions of hostile\r\nsentiment, regarding the Act as an infringement of their chartered\r\nprivileges; and they argued that if the legislative powers of so loyal a\r\ncolony as New York could be thus suspended, they had little security for\r\ntheir own privileges guaranteed to them by Charter.[292]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January, while the House of Commons, in Committee of\r\nSupply, was considering the estimate for the garrison and land forces in\r\nthe colonies, Mr. Grenville took the opportunity of expressing his\r\ndissatisfaction with the repeal of the Stamp Act, and insisted upon the\r\nnecessity of relieving England from the burden, which should be borne by\r\nthe colonies, and which, with contingencies, exceeded £400,000. Mr.\r\nCharles Townshend, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, replied that \"the\r\nAdministration has given its attention to give relief to Great Britain\r\nfrom bearing the whole expense of securing, defending, and protecting\r\nAmerica and the West India islands. I shall bring into the House some\r\npropositions that I hope may tend, in time, to ease the people of\r\nEngland upon this head, and yet not be heavy in any manner upon the\r\npeople in the colonies. _I know the mode by which a revenue may be drawn\r\nfrom America without offence._\" He was applauded from all sides of the\r\nHouse, and continued: \"I am still a firm advocate for the Stamp Act, for\r\nits principle, and for the duty itself; only the heats which prevailed\r\nmade it an improper time to press it. I laugh at the absurd distinction\r\nbetween internal and external taxes. I know of no such distinction. It\r\nis a distinction without a difference. It is perfect nonsense. If we\r\nhave a right to impose the one, we have a right to impose the other. The\r\ndistinction is ridiculous in the opinion of everybody except the\r\nAmericans.\"[293] In conclusion, laying his hand on the table in front of\r\nhim, he declared to the House, \"England is undone if this taxation of\r\nAmerica is given up.\"[294] Grenville demanded Townsend to pledge himself\r\nto his declaration of obtaining a revenue from the colonies; and did so\r\npromptly amid the applause of the House. In June, Townshend proceeded to\r\nredeem his pledge, and for that purpose brought successively three Bills\r\ninto the House, all of which were passed by nearly unanimous votes.\r\n\r\n\"The first of these Bills, in the preamble, declared an American revenue\r\nexpedient, and promised to raise it by granting duties on glass, red\r\nand white lead, painters' oil and paper, and threepence a pound on\r\ntea--all English productions except the last--all objects of taxation in\r\nthe colonies. The exportation of tea to America was encouraged by\r\nanother Act which allowed a drawback for five years of the whole duty\r\npayable on importation into England.\"[295] The preamble of the Bill\r\nstated that the duties are laid for the better support of the government\r\nand the administration of the colonies. One clause of the Act enabled\r\nthe King, by sign manual, to establish a general civil list for each\r\nprovince of North America, with any salaries, pensions, or appointments\r\nhis Majesty might think proper. The Act also provided, after all such\r\nministerial warrants under the sign manual \"as are thought proper and\r\nnecessary\" shall be satisfied, the residue of the revenue shall be at\r\nthe disposal of the Parliament.[296]\r\n\r\n2. The second Bill, intended to ensure the execution of the first,\r\nauthorized his Majesty to appoint a Board of Commissioners of Customs to\r\nreside in the colonies, to give them such orders and instructions from\r\ntime to time as his Majesty might think proper. This Board of Customs\r\nhad its seat at Boston; its duty was to see to the strict enforcement of\r\nthe revenue laws in America, and it was authorized to make as many\r\nappointments as the Commissioners might think fit, and to pay the\r\nappointees what sums they pleased, and were not accountable for their\r\nmalconduct, though they were authorized to seize vessels suspected of\r\nhaving goods which had not been duly entered.[297]\r\n\r\n3. A third Bill, in Mr. Charles Townshend's scheme for the taxation of\r\nthe colonies, was for the establishment in America of _Courts of\r\nVice-Admiralty_--at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston--Courts\r\nin which the colonists were deprived of the right of trial by jury,\r\nwhich were invested with authority to seize and transport accused persons\r\nto England to be tried there--Courts of which the officers and informers\r\nwere paid out of the proceeds of sales of confiscated goods, and in\r\nproportion to their amounts, and were therefore personally interested\r\nin confiscating as many goods as possible, and from their decisions\r\nthere was no appeal except to England--a process not only tedious,\r\nbut ruinously expensive, even if successful, of which there could\r\nbe little hope.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these three Acts (the operations and effects of which\r\nCharles Townshend did not live to see),[298] the navy and military in\r\nAmerica were commanded, not as a defence against foreign or even Indian\r\ninvasions, but as Custom-house guards and officers, to enforce the\r\npayment of taxes on the colonists. The very next day after the King had\r\ngiven the royal sanction to the system of Courts of Admiralty in\r\nAmerica, \"orders were issued directly to the Commander-in-Chief in\r\nAmerica, that the troops under his command should give their assistance\r\nto the officers of the revenue for the effectual suppression of the\r\ncontraband trade. Nor was there delay in following up the new law, to\r\nemploy the navy to enforce the Navigation Acts. To this end Admiral\r\nColville, the naval Commander-in-Chief on the coasts of North America,\r\nfrom the River St. Lawrence to Cape Florida and the Bahama Islands,\r\nbecame the head of a new corps of revenue officers. Each captain of his\r\nsquadron had Custom-house commissions, and a set of instructions from\r\nthe Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty for his guidance; and other\r\ninstructions were given them by the Admiral, to enter into the harbours\r\nor lie off the coasts of America; to qualify themselves, by taking the\r\nusual Custom-house oaths, to do the office of Custom-house officers; to\r\nseize such persons as were suspected by them to be engaged in illicit\r\ntrade.\"[299]\r\n\r\nThe effect of these acts and measures was to create universal\r\ndissatisfaction throughout the colonies, as they were not even in\r\npretence for the regulation of trade, but for the purpose of raising a\r\nparliamentary revenue in America, and therefore differed not in\r\nprinciple from the tax imposed by the Stamp Act. \"The colonists\r\ncontended that there was no real difference between the principle of\r\nthese new duties and the Stamp Act. They were both designed to raise a\r\nrevenue in America, and in the same manner. The payment of the duties\r\nimposed by the Stamp Act might have been evaded by the total disuse of\r\nstamped paper, and so might the payment of these duties by the total\r\ndisuse of those articles on which they were laid; but in neither case\r\nwithout great difficulty. The Revenue Act of 1767 produced resolves,\r\npetitions, addresses, remonstrances, similar to those with which the\r\ncolonists opposed the Stamp Act. It also gave rise to a second\r\nassociation for suspending further importations of British manufactures\r\ntill those offensive duties should be taken off.\"[300]\r\n\r\nThe year 1767 closed with enlarging and multiplying associations to\r\ndispense with the use of goods of British manufacture, the appointment\r\nof Lord North to succeed Charles Townshend as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and of the Earl of Hillsborough to succeed the Earl of\r\nShelburne as Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord North had voted\r\nfor the Stamp Act and against its repeal; and Lord Hillsborough was less\r\nindulgent to the colonies than Lord Shelburne.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: \"This affair being brought before the House occasioned\r\nmany debates, and some vigorous measures were proposed. June 15th, a\r\nBill was passed by which the Governor, Council, and Assembly of New York\r\nwere prohibited from passing or assenting to any Act of Assembly for any\r\npurpose whatsoever, till they had in every respect complied with all the\r\nterms of the Act of Parliament. This restriction, though limited to one\r\ncolony, was a lesson to them all, and showed their comparative\r\ninferiority, when brought in question with the supreme legislative\r\npower.\" (Annual Register for 1767, Vol. X., p. 48.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: The carrying into effect of the Billeting Act in Boston\r\nis thus stated by Mr. Holmes:\r\n\r\n\"An Act had been passed by Parliament, the same session in which the\r\nStamp Act was passed, that obliged the Colonial Assemblies to provide\r\nquarters for the soldiers, and furnish them with fire, beds, candles,\r\nand other articles at the expense of the colonies. The jealousy of\r\nMassachusetts was awakened by the attempt of the Governor to execute\r\nthis law. In June an addition was made to the British troops at the\r\ncastle, in the harbour of Boston, and the Governor requested that\r\nprovision be made by the Assembly for their support. After due\r\ndeliberation, the House resolved that such provision be made for them\r\nwhile they remain here, as has been heretofore usually made for his\r\nMajesty's regular troops when occasionally in the province. The caution\r\nwith which this resolution was drawn shows how reluctant the Assembly\r\nwere to have a military force placed in the province; and how careful\r\nneither to yield any portion of their legislative rights, nor to furnish\r\na precedent for the repetition of a measure equally obnoxious and\r\ndangerous to the colonists. The suspension of the power of legislation\r\nin New York justly excited alarm throughout all the colonies; for it was\r\nperceived that every Colonial Assembly would, by parity of reasoning, be\r\nput on their trial for good behaviour, of which the British Ministry\r\nwould be the judge. Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, said, 'An Act for\r\nsuspending the Legislature of that province hangs, like a flaming sword,\r\nover all our heads, and requires by all means to be removed.'\" (Annals,\r\netc., Vol. II., p. 149.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: The Americans took the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his\r\nword, the plain and logical inference from which was, that if it was\r\nunlawful to impose _internal_ taxes, it was equally unlawful to impose\r\n_external_ taxes. The colonies had unanimously denied the lawfulness of\r\n_internal_ taxes imposed by Parliament, and in that denial had been\r\nsustained by the opinions of Lord Camden, Pitt, and other English\r\nstatesmen, and virtually by the repeal of the Stamp Act itself.\r\nHenceforth they resisted the imposition by Parliament of external as\r\nwell as internal taxes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Referring to the applause of the Commons which greeted\r\nTownshend's utterances of his intention to draw a revenue from the\r\ncolonies, Mr. Bancroft says: \"The loud burst of rapture dismayed Conway,\r\nwho sat in silent astonishment at the unauthorized but premeditated\r\nrashness of his presumptuous colleague. The next night the Cabinet\r\nquestioned the insubordinate Minister 'how he had ventured to depart on\r\nso essential a point from the profession of the whole Ministry;' and he\r\nbrowbeat them all. 'I appeal to you,' said he, turning to Conway,\r\n'whether the House is not bent on obtaining a revenue of some sort from\r\nthe colonies?' Not one of the Ministry then in London (Pitt being absent\r\nand ill) had sufficient authority to advise his dismission, and nothing\r\nless could have stopped his measures.\" (History of the United States,\r\nVol. VI., Chap. xxvii., pp. 47-49.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: \"The colonists had been previously restrained from\r\nmanufacturing certain articles for their own consumption. Other Acts\r\nconfined them to the exclusive use of British merchandise. The addition\r\nof duties put them wholly in the power and discretion of Great Britain.\r\n'We are not,' said they, 'permitted to import from any nation other than\r\nour own parent state, and have been, in some cases, restrained by her\r\nfrom manufacturing for ourselves; and she claims a right to do so in\r\nevery instance which is incompatible with her interest. To these\r\nrestrictions we have hitherto submitted; but she now rises in her\r\ndemands, and imposes duties on those commodities, the purchasing of\r\nwhich elsewhere than in her own market her laws forbid, and the\r\nmanufacturing of which for her own use she may, at any moment she\r\npleases, restrain. Nothing is left for us to do but to complain and\r\npay.'\" (Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., pp. 351, 352.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: \"Townshend opened the debate with professions of candour,\r\nand the air of a man of business. Exculpating alike Pennsylvania and\r\nConnecticut, he named as the delinquent colonies--Massachusetts, which\r\nhad invaded the King's prerogative by a general amnesty, and in a\r\nmessage to its Governor had used expressions derogatory to the authority\r\nof Parliament; Rhode Island, which had postponed but not refused to\r\nindemnify the sufferers by the Stamp Act; and New Jersey, which had\r\nevaded the Billeting Act, but had yet furnished the King's troops with\r\nevery essential thing to their perfect satisfaction. Against these\r\ncolonies it was not necessary to institute severe proceedings. But New\r\nYork, in the month of June last, besides appointing its own Commissary,\r\nhad limited its supplies to two regiments, and to those articles only\r\nwhich were provided in the rest of the King's dominions, and in December\r\nhad refused to do more.\r\n\r\n\"It became Parliament not to engage in controversy with its colonies,\r\nbut to assert its sovereignty without uniting them in a common cause.\r\nFor this end he proposed to proceed against New York, and against New\r\nYork alone. To levy a local tax would be to accept a penalty in lieu of\r\nobedience. He should, therefore, move that New York, having disobeyed\r\nParliament, should be restrained from any legislative act of its own\r\ntill it should comply.\r\n\r\n\"He then proceeded to advocate the establishment of a Board of\r\nCommissioners of the Customs, to be stationed in America.\r\n\r\n\"'Our right of taxation,' he continued, 'is indubitable; yet, to prevent\r\nmischief, I was myself in favour of repealing the Stamp Act. But there\r\ncan be no objection to port duties on wine, oil, and fruits, if allowed\r\nto be carried to America directly from Spain and Portugal; on glass,\r\npaper, lead, and colours; and especially on tea. Owing to the high\r\ncharges in England, America has supplied itself with tea by smuggling it\r\nfrom the Dutch possessions; to remedy this, duties hitherto levied upon\r\nit in England are to be given up, and a specific duty collected in\r\nAmerica itself.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The American revenue, it was further explained, was to be placed at the\r\ndisposal of the King for the payment of his civil officers.\r\n\r\n\"This speech, pronounced with gravity and an air of moderation by an\r\norator who was the delight of the House, implied a revolution in favour\r\nof authority. The Minister was to have the irresponsible power of\r\nestablishing, by sign manual, a general civil list in every American\r\nprovince, and at his pleasure to grant salaries and pensions, limited\r\nonly by the amount of the American revenue. The proposition bore on its\r\nface the mark of owing its parentage to the holders and patrons of\r\nAmerican offices; and yet it was received in the House with general\r\nfavour. Richard Jackson was not regarded when he spoke against the\r\nduties themselves, and foretold the mischief that would ensue.\"\r\n(Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VI., Chap. xxix., pp.\r\n75-77.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: The Commissioners, from the first moment of their\r\ninstitution, had been an eyesore to the people of Boston. This, though\r\npartly owing to their active zeal in detecting smugglers, principally\r\narose from the association which existed in the minds of the inhabitants\r\nbetween the Board of Customs and an American revenue. The Declaratory\r\nAct of 1766, the Revenue Act of 1767, together with the pomp and expense\r\nof this Board, so disproportionate to the small income of the present\r\nduties, conspired to convince not only the few who were benefitted by\r\nsmuggling, but the great body of enlightened freemen, that further and\r\ngreater impositions of parliamentary taxes were intended. In proportion\r\nas this opinion gained ground, the inhabitants became more disrespectful\r\nto the executive officers of the revenue, and more disposed, in the\r\nfrenzy of patriotism, to commit outrages on their persons and property.\r\nThe constant bickering that existed between them and the inhabitants,\r\ntogether with the steady opposition given by the latter to the discharge\r\nof the official duties of the former, induced the Commissioners and\r\nfriends of an American revenue to solicit the protection of a regular\r\nforce at Boston. In compliance with their wishes, his Majesty ordered\r\ntwo regiments and some armed vessels to repair thither for supporting\r\nand assisting the officers of Customs in the execution of their duty.\r\n(Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., pp. 355, 356.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: His Revenue Act, and the two subsequent Acts to give it\r\neffect, produced an excitement throughout the American colonies that\r\nwill be noticed hereafter. Mr. Bancroft remarks: \"They would nullify\r\nTownshend's Revenue Act by consuming nothing on which he had laid a\r\nduty, and avenge themselves on England by importing no more British\r\ngoods. At the beginning of this excitement (September, 1767), Charles\r\nTownshend was seized with fever, and after a short illness, during which\r\nhe met danger with the unconcerned levity that had marked his conduct of\r\nthe most serious affairs, he died at the age of forty-one, famed alike\r\nfor incomparable talents and extreme instability.\" (History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. VI., p. 98.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. V., Chapter\r\nix., pp. 161, 162. Mr. Bancroft adds:\r\n\r\n\"The promise of large emoluments in case of forfeiture stimulated their\r\nnatural and irregular vivacity to enforce laws which had become\r\nobsolete, and they pounced upon American property as they would have\r\ngone to war in quest of prize-money. Even at first their acts were\r\nequivocal, and they soon came to be as illegal as they were oppressive.\r\nThere was no redress. An appeal to the Privy Council was costly and\r\ndifficult; and besides, when it so happened, before the end of the year,\r\nthat an officer had to defend himself on an appeal, the suffering\r\ncolonists were exhausted by the delay and expense, while the Treasury\r\ntook care to indemnify their agent.\"--_Ib._, p. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol I., Chapter iii., pp. 352,\r\n353.\r\n\r\n\"Towards the last of October, the inhabitants of Boston, 'ever sensitive\r\nto the sound of liberty,' assembled in a town meeting, and voted to\r\ndispense with a large number of articles of British manufacture, which,\r\nwere particularly specified; to adhere to former agreements respecting\r\nfunerals; and to purchase no new clothing for mourning. Committees were\r\nappointed to obtain subscribers to this agreement, and the resolves were\r\nsent in to all the towns of the province and abroad to other colonies.\r\nThe 20th of the ensuing month (20th of November, the time when the Acts\r\nwent into operation) passed without tumult. Placards were exhibited and\r\neffigies were set up, but the people in general were quiet. Otis (the\r\nmost popular man in Boston), at a town meeting _held to discountenance\r\nriot_, delivered a speech in which he recommended caution, and advised\r\nthat no opposition should be made to the new duties. 'The King has a\r\nright,' said he, 'to appoint officers of the Customs in what manner he\r\npleases and by what denominations; and to resist his authority will but\r\nprovoke his displeasure.' Such counsel was displeasing to the zealous,\r\nbut it was followed.\" (Barry's History of Massachusetts, Vol. II.,\r\nChapter xi., pp. 340, 341.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1768--PROTESTS AND LOYAL PETITIONS OF THE COLONISTS AGAINST\r\nTHE ENGLISH PARLIAMENTARY ACTS FOR RAISING REVENUE IN THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meetings and protests against the Revenue Acts and petitions for\r\ntheir repeal, which began in the autumn of 1767, increased throughout\r\nthe colonies in 1768. In January, the General Assembly of Massachusetts\r\nvoted a temperate and loyal petition to the King,[301] and letters\r\nurging the rights of the province, addressed to Lord Shelburne, General\r\nConway, the Marquis of Rockingham, Lord Camden, and the Earl of Chatham.\r\nThe petition and these letters were all to the same effect. The petition\r\nto the King was enclosed to Denis de Berdt, a London merchant (who was\r\nappointed agent for the colony), with a long letter of instructions. All\r\nthese papers are pervaded with a spirit of loyalty, and ask for nothing\r\nmore than the enjoyment of the rights and privileges which they had ever\r\npossessed and enjoyed down to the year after the peace of Paris in\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these representations and letters sent to England, the\r\nMassachusetts General Assembly adopted, on the 11th of February, and\r\nsent a circular letter to the Speakers of the respective Houses of\r\nBurgesses of the other American provinces. In this ably-written letter\r\nthere is no dictation or assumption of authority, but a statement of\r\ntheir representations to England, and a desire for mutual consultation\r\nand harmonious action. They say: \"This House hope that this letter will\r\nbe candidly considered in no other light than as expressing a\r\ndisposition freely to communicate their mind to a sister colony, upon a\r\ncommon concern, in the same manner as they would be glad to receive the\r\nsentiments of your or any other House of Assembly on the continent.\"\r\n\r\nAs this letter was the first step to the union of the American colonies,\r\nand was followed by results that culminated in the War of Independence,\r\nit may be proper to give such extracts from it as will show its\r\ncharacter and design; in neither of which do I find anything which I\r\nthink is inconsistent with the principles and spirit of a loyal subject.\r\nThe general principles on which they rested their claims to the rights\r\nand privileges of British subjects are stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The House have humbly represented to the Ministry their own sentiments:\r\nThat his Majesty's High Court of Parliament is the supreme legislative\r\npower over the whole empire. That in all free States the constitution is\r\nfixed; and as the supreme legislative derives its power and authority\r\nfrom the constitution, it cannot overleap the bounds of it without\r\ndestroying its foundation. That the constitution ascertains and limits\r\nboth sovereignty and allegiance; and therefore his Majesty's American\r\nsubjects, who acknowledge themselves bound by the ties of allegiance,\r\nhave an equitable claim to the full enjoyment of the fundamental rules\r\nof the British constitution. That it is an essential, unalterable right\r\nin nature, ingrafted into the British constitution as a fundamental law,\r\nand ever held sacred and irrevocable by the subjects within the realm,\r\nthat what a man hath honestly acquired is absolutely his own, which he\r\nmay freely give, but cannot be taken from him without his consent. That\r\nthe American subjects may, therefore, exclusive of any consideration of\r\nCharter rights, with a decent firmness adapted to the character of\r\nfreemen and subjects, assert this natural constitutional right.\r\n\r\n\"It is moreover their humble opinion, which they express with the\r\ngreatest deference to the wisdom of the Parliament, that the Acts made\r\nthere, imposing duties on the people of this Province, _with the sole\r\nand express purpose of raising a revenue_, are infringements of their\r\nnatural and constitutional rights; because, as they are not represented\r\nin the British Parliament, his Majesty's Commons in Great Britain by\r\nthose Acts grant their property without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after showing the impracticability, on various grounds, of the\r\nrepresentation of the colonies in the British Parliament, on which\r\naccount local subordinate Legislatures were established, that the\r\ncolonists might enjoy the inalienable right of representation, the\r\ncircular letter proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"Upon these principles, and also considering that were the right in the\r\nParliament ever so clear, yet for obvious reasons it would be beyond the\r\nrule of equity, that their constituents should be taxed on the\r\nmanufactures of Great Britain here, in addition to the duties they pay\r\nfor them in England, and other advantages arising to Great Britain from\r\nthe Acts of Trade, this House have preferred a humble, dutiful, and\r\nloyal petition to our most gracious Sovereign, and made such\r\nrepresentation to his Majesty's Ministers as they apprehend would tend\r\nto obtain redress.\r\n\r\n\"They have also submitted to consideration, whether any people can be\r\nsaid to enjoy any degree of freedom if the Crown, in addition to its\r\nundoubted authority of constituting a Governor, should appoint him such\r\na stipend as it shall judge proper, without the consent of the people,\r\nand at their expense; and whether, while the judges of the land and\r\nother civil officers hold not their commissions during good behaviour,\r\ntheir having salaries appointed for them by the Crown, independent of\r\nthe people, hath not a tendency to subvert the principles of equity and\r\nendanger the happiness and security of the subjects.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to these measures, the House have wrote a letter to their\r\nagent, Mr. De Berdt, the sentiments of which he is directed to lay\r\nbefore the Ministry, wherein they take notice of the hardship of the Act\r\nfor Preventing Mutiny and Desertion, which requires the Governor and\r\nCouncil to provide enumerated articles for the King's marching troops,\r\nand the people to pay the expense; and also the commission of the\r\ngentlemen appointed Commissioners of Customs to reside in America, which\r\nauthorizes them to make as many appointments as they think fit, and to\r\npay the appointees what sums they please, for whose malconduct they are\r\nnot accountable.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"These are the sentiments and proceedings of this House; and as they\r\nhave too much reason to believe that the enemies of the colonies have\r\nrepresented them to his Majesty's Ministers and the Parliament as\r\nfactious, disloyal, and having a disposition to make themselves\r\nindependent of the mother country, they have taken occasion, in the most\r\nhumble terms, to assure his Majesty and his Ministers that, with regard\r\nto the people of this province, and, as they doubt not, of all the\r\ncolonies, the charge is unjust.\r\n\r\n\"The House is fully satisfied that your Assembly is too generous and\r\nenlarged in sentiment to believe that this letter proceeds from an\r\nambition of taking the lead, or dictating to other Assemblies; they\r\nfreely submit their opinion to the judgment of others, and shall take it\r\nkind in your House to point out to them anything further that may be\r\nthought necessary.\r\n\r\n\"This House cannot conclude without expressing their firm confidence in\r\nthe King, our common Head and Father, that the united and dutiful\r\nsupplications of his distressed American subjects will meet with his\r\nRoyal and favourable acceptance.\r\n\r\n\"SIGNED BY THE SPEAKER.\"\r\n\r\nThis circular letter of the Massachusetts Assembly was exceedingly\r\ndispleasing to the British Ministry, and called forth two letters from\r\nthe Earl of Hillsborough, who had succeeded the Earl of Shelburne as\r\nPrincipal Secretary of State for the Colonies.\r\n\r\nOne of these letters was a circular addressed through the Governor to\r\nthe General Assemblies of each of the several colonies. This letter is\r\ndated \"Whitehall, April 21, 1768.\" The first paragraph is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,--I have his Majesty's commands to transmit to you the\r\nenclosed copy of a letter from the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the colony of Massachusetts Bay, addressed by order\r\nof that House to the Speaker of the Assembly of each colony upon the\r\ncontinent of North America; as his Majesty considers this measure to be\r\nof a most dangerous and factious tendency, calculated to inflame the\r\nminds of his good subjects in the colonies, to promote an unwarrantable\r\ncombination, and to excite and encourage an open opposition to and\r\ndenial of the authority of Parliament, and to subvert the true\r\nprinciples of the constitution, it is his Majesty's pleasure that you\r\nshould, immediately upon the receipt hereof, exert your utmost influence\r\nto defeat this flagitious attempt to disturb the public peace, by\r\nprevailing upon the Assembly of your province to take no notice of it,\r\nwhich will be treating it with the contempt it deserves.\"\r\n\r\nThis most ill-advised letter of Lord Hillsborough had the very opposite\r\neffect from that which he had hoped and intended. It increased the\r\nimportance of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the\r\nestimation of other colonies, and produced responses of approval from\r\nmost of their General Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, in a letter to the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts, dated\r\nVirginia, May 9, 1768, says:\r\n\r\n\"The House of Burgesses of this colony proceeded, very soon after they\r\nmet, to the consideration of your important letter of the 11th of\r\nFebruary, 1768, written in the name and by the order of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of your province; and I have received their particular\r\ndirection to desire you to inform that honourable House that they\r\napplaud them for their attention to American liberty, and that the steps\r\nthey have taken thereon will convince them of their opinion of the fatal\r\ntendency of the Acts of Parliament complained of, and of their fixed\r\nresolution to concur with the other colonies in their application for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\n\"After the most deliberate consultation, they thought it their duty to\r\nrepresent to the Parliament of Great Britain that they are truly\r\nsensible of the happiness and security they derive from their connection\r\nwith and dependence upon Great Britain, and are under the greatest\r\nconcern that any unlucky incident should interrupt that salutary harmony\r\nwhich they wish ever to subsist. They lament that the remoteness of\r\ntheir situation often exposes them to such misrepresentations as are apt\r\nto involve them in censures of disloyalty to their Sovereign, and the\r\nwant of proper respect to the British Parliament; whereas they have\r\nindulged themselves in the agreeable persuasion, that they ought to be\r\nconsidered as inferior to none of their fellow-subjects in loyalty and\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"They do not affect an independency of their parent kingdom, the\r\nprosperity of which they are bound to the utmost of their abilities to\r\npromote, but cheerfully acquiesce in the authority of Parliament to make\r\nlaws for preserving a necessary dependence and for regulating the trade\r\nof the colonies. Yet they cannot conceive, and humbly insist it is not\r\nessential to support a proper relation between the mother country and\r\ncolonies transplanted from her, that she should have a right to raise\r\nmoney from them without their consent, and presume they do not aspire to\r\nmore than the natural rights of British subjects when they assert that\r\nno power on earth has a right to impose taxes on the people, or take the\r\nsmallest portion of their property, without their consent given by their\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament. This has ever been considered as the\r\nchief pillar of the constitution. Without this support no man can be\r\nsaid to have the least shadow of liberty, since they can have no\r\nproperty in that which another can by right take from them when he\r\npleases, without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the antiquity and grounds of their rights as British\r\nsubjects, and to the fact of their not being represented in Parliament,\r\nof the impracticability of being so, and \"the oppressive Stamp Act,\r\nconfessedly imposing internal taxes, and the late Acts of Parliament\r\ngiving and granting certain duties in the British colonies, mainly\r\ntending to the same end,\" the Virginia House of Burgesses proceed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The Act suspending the legislative power of New York, they consider as\r\nstill more alarming to the colonists, though it has that single province\r\nin view. If the Parliament can compel them to furnish a single article\r\nto the troops sent over, they may by the same rule oblige them to\r\nfurnish clothes, arms, and every other necessary, even the pay of the\r\nofficers and soldiers--a doctrine replete with every mischief, and\r\nutterly subversive of all that is dear and valuable. For what advantage\r\ncan the people of the colonies derive from their right of choosing their\r\nown representatives, if those representatives, when chosen, were not\r\npermitted to exercise their own judgments--were under a necessity (on\r\npain of being deprived of their legislative authority) of enforcing the\r\nmandates of the British Parliament?\r\n\r\n\"They trust they have expressed themselves with a firmness that becomes\r\nfreemen pleading for essential rights, and with a decency that will take\r\noff every imputation of faction or disloyalty. They repose entire\r\nconfidence in his Majesty, who is ever attentive to the complaints of\r\nhis subjects, and is ever ready to relieve their distress; and they are\r\nnot without hopes that the colonies, united in a decent and regular\r\nopposition, may prevail on the new House of Commons to put a stop to\r\nmeasures so directly repugnant to the interests both of the mother\r\ncountry and her colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after these proceedings by the House of Burgesses, the Governor\r\nof Virginia dissolved them.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives of New Jersey, after gratefully\r\nacknowledging the receipt of the Massachusetts circular, observe:\r\n\r\n\"The freedom with which the House of Representatives of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay have communicated their sentiments upon a matter of so\r\ngreat concern to all the colonies, hath been received by this House with\r\nthat candour the spirit and design of your letter merits. And at the\r\nsame time that they acknowledge themselves obliged to you for\r\ncommunicating your sentiments to them, they have directed me to assure\r\nyou that they are desirous to keep up a correspondence with you, and to\r\nunite with the colonies, if necessary, in further supplications to his\r\nMajesty to relieve his distressed American subjects.\"\r\n\r\nAnswers to the Massachusetts circular from the Houses of Representatives\r\nof Connecticut, of Georgia, and of Maryland, were given to the same\r\neffect. The Maryland House of Representatives, in addition to the answer\r\nto the Speaker of the House of Representatives, presented an address to\r\nGovernor Sharpe, of Maryland, in reply to the letter of Lord\r\nHillsborough. Their address is dated June 23rd, 1768, and contains the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"In answer to your Excellency's message of the 20th, we must observe,\r\nthat if the letter from the Speaker of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe colony of Massachusetts Bay, addressed to and communicated by our\r\nSpeaker to this House, be the same with the letter, a copy of which you\r\nare pleased to intimate hath been communicated to the King's Ministers,\r\nit is very alarming to find, at a time when the people of America think\r\nthemselves aggrieved by the late Acts of Parliament imposing taxes on\r\nthem for the sole and express purpose of raising a revenue, and in the\r\nmost dutiful manner are seeking redress from the Throne, any endeavours\r\nto unite in laying before their Sovereign what is apprehended to be\r\ntheir just complaint, should be looked upon 'as a measure of most\r\ndangerous and factious tendency, calculated to inflame the minds of his\r\nMajesty's good subjects in the colonies, and to promote an unwarrantable\r\ncombination, to excite and encourage an open opposition to and denial of\r\nthe authority of Parliament, and to subvert the true principles of the\r\nconstitution.'\r\n\r\n\"We cannot but view this as an attempt in some of his Majesty's\r\nMinisters to suppress all communication of sentiments between the\r\ncolonies, and to prevent the united supplications of America from\r\nreaching the royal ear. We hope the conduct of this House will ever\r\nevince their reverence and respect for the laws, and faithful\r\nattachment to the constitution; but we cannot be brought to resent an\r\nexertion of the most undoubted constitutional right of petitioning the\r\nThrone, or any endeavours to procure and preserve a union of the\r\ncolonies, as an unjustifiable attempt to revive those distractions which\r\nit is said have operated so fatally to the prejudice of both the\r\ncolonies and the mother country. We have the warmest and most\r\naffectionate attachment to our most gracious Sovereign, and shall ever\r\npay the readiest and most respectful regard to the just and\r\nconstitutional power of the British Parliament; but we shall not be\r\nintimidated by a few sounding expressions from doing what we think is\r\nright.\"[302]\r\n\r\nThus the unconstitutional assumptions and despotic instructions of Lord\r\nHillsborough to the Legislative Assemblies of the several colonies were\r\nmanfully and in a moderate and loyal spirit repelled by them, in the\r\nclear knowledge of the constitutional rights of Englishmen, whether\r\nresident in America or England. But while Lord Hillsborough foolishly\r\nand vainly dictated to the several colonies to treat the colony of\r\nMassachusetts with contempt, he advanced a step further in his would-be\r\ndomination over Massachusetts itself by directing Governor Barnard to\r\norder the House of Representatives, under a threat of dissolution, to\r\nrescind the resolution which they had adopted to send the circular to\r\nthe representative Assemblies of other colonies. Lord Hillsborough, in a\r\nletter to the Governor of Massachusetts Bay, dated April 22nd, 1768,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It is the King's pleasure, that so soon as the General Court is again\r\nassembled, at the time prescribed by the Charter, you should require of\r\nthe House of Representatives, in his Majesty's name, to rescind the\r\nresolution which gave birth to the circular letter from the Speaker, and\r\nto declare their disapprobation thereof, and dissent to that rash and\r\nhasty proceeding.\" \"But if, notwithstanding the apprehensions which may\r\njustly be entertained of the ill-consequences of a continuance of this\r\nfactious spirit, which seems to have influenced the resolutions of the\r\nAssembly at the conclusion of the last session, the new Assembly should\r\nrefuse to comply with his Majesty's reasonable expectation, it is the\r\nKing's pleasure that you should immediately dissolve them, and transmit\r\nto me, to be laid before his Majesty, an account of their proceedings\r\nthereupon, to the end that his Majesty may, if he thinks fit, lay the\r\nwhole matter before his Parliament, that such provisions as shall be\r\nfound necessary may be made to prevent for the future a conduct of so\r\nextraordinary and unconstitutional a nature.\"[303]\r\n\r\nIf it was unwise for Lord Hillsborough to write letters to the Governors\r\nof the several colonies to induce their Assemblies to treat with silent\r\ncontempt the circular letter of the Massachusetts Assembly, it was\r\nabsurd for him to order that Assembly to rescind its resolution to send\r\na letter which had been sent, and acted upon, and answered--a resolution\r\nand letter, indeed, of a preceding House of Assembly. But the new House\r\nof Assembly, after long deliberation and discussion, refused, by a\r\nmajority of 92 to 17, to rescind the obnoxious resolution of the late\r\nHouse of Assembly, and at the same time prepared and addressed to Lord\r\nHillsborough an elaborate letter in vindication of their proceedings.\r\nThe House was, of course, forthwith _dissolved_.\r\n\r\nLord Hillsborough's letter produced discontent not only in\r\nMassachusetts, but in all the American provinces. It, in effect, denied\r\nthe right of consultation and petition to the colonists; for, as was\r\nsaid by Dr. Franklin, \"a demand attended with a penalty of dissolution\r\nseemed a command, not a requisition, leaving no deliberative or\r\ndiscretionary power in the Assembly; and the ground of its being a\r\npetition to the King, guarded with a most explicit declaration of the\r\nsupreme legislative power of Parliament, it wore the severe and dreadful\r\nappearance of a penal prohibition against petitioning. It was, in\r\neffect, saying you shall not even presume to complain, and reducing them\r\nbelow the common state of slavery, in which, if men complain with\r\ndecency, they are heard unless their masters happen to be monsters. It\r\nwarmed moderation into zeal, and inflamed zeal into rage. Yet still\r\nthere appeared a disposition to express their grievances in humble\r\npetitions. All the Assemblies on the continent, in answer to a\r\nrequisition of similar import to that already mentioned, asserted the\r\nright of the subject to petition for redress of grievances. They joined\r\nin petitions stating the imposition of taxes upon them without their\r\nconsent, and the abolition of juries in revenue cases, as intolerable\r\ngrievances, from which they prayed relief.\"[304]\r\n\r\nIt is singular and proper to observe that the Massachusetts Assembly\r\nwere now complaining, and justly complaining, of the denial of their\r\nright of petition, and of being taxed without their own consent, when\r\nmore than a century before their forefathers had not only denied the\r\nright of religious worship according to their conscience to Baptists,\r\nPresbyterians, and Episcopalians, but the right of petition for the\r\nredress of grievances to both the local Legislature and the King and\r\nParliament, and seized their private papers and fined and imprisoned\r\nthem for attempting thus to petition; denied to four-fifths of the\r\ninhabitants of Massachusetts Bay the right of franchise itself, because\r\nthey were not certified members of the Congregational Church; taxed them\r\nfor half a century without allowing them any representation in the\r\nLegislature that taxed them, and then fined and imprisoned those of them\r\nwho complained by petition of thus being taxed without representation,\r\nas well as being denied the freedom of religious worship.\r\n\r\nBut though the General Assembly of Massachusetts Bay were now receiving\r\na part of the measure which their preceding General Assemblies had meted\r\nout in full measure to four-fifths of their own fellow-citizens during\r\nmore than half of the previous century, yet that does not make Lord\r\nHillsborough's letter the less unconstitutional and tyrannical, nor the\r\nconduct and vindication of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts\r\nBay less manly and justifiable. The Governor of the colony and his\r\nabettors had represented constitutional opposition and remonstrances\r\nagainst single Acts of Parliament, and of the Ministers of the day, as\r\ndisloyalty to the King and treasonable resistance to lawful authority,\r\nand had already pursued such a course of action as to create a pretext\r\nfor bringing soldiers and ships of war to the city, and consequent\r\nhostility and collisions between citizens and the soldiery, so as\r\napparently to justify the suspension of the constituted legislative\r\nauthorities in Massachusetts Bay, and enable the governors, judges, and\r\nexecutive officers to obtain large salaries and perquisites out of the\r\ncolonists for present gratification and future residence and expenditure\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was at that time the most populous and the most wealthy\r\ncolony in America, and Boston was the port of the largest trade; and\r\nthough the House of Representatives there had not used stronger language\r\nin its remonstrances to Parliament and petitions to the King than the\r\nHouse of Representatives of Virginia (the next most populous colony), or\r\nPennsylvania, or New York, or Maryland, or New Jersey, or Connecticut,\r\nor Rhode Island, yet the British Ministry determined to establish the\r\nnewly-asserted parliamentary power in America by making an example of\r\nMassachusetts and of the port of Boston. There was the appointed seat of\r\nthe English Board of Commissioners of Customs, attended by a _posse_ of\r\nofficers whose haughtiness and taunts and threats contributed not a\r\nlittle to irritate those with whom they had intercourse.\r\n\r\nThree circumstances occurred which tended to increase the popular\r\nirritation, and hasten the approaching crisis--the seizure and detention\r\nof a sloop, the stationing of soldiers in the city, and pressing of\r\nseamen contrary to law.\r\n\r\nAs to the seizure of the vessel, accounts differ. Dr. Holmes, in his\r\nAnnals, says:\r\n\r\n\"The laws of trade had been hitherto greatly eluded, but the\r\nCommissioners of the Customs were now determined that they should be\r\nexecuted. On the arrival of the sloop _Liberty_, laden with wines from\r\nMadeira, belonging to Mr. John Hancock, an eminent merchant of Boston,\r\nthe tidesman, Thomas Kirk, went on board, and was followed by Captain\r\nMarshall, who was in Mr. Hancock's employ. On Kirk's refusing several\r\nproposals made to him, Marshall with five or six others confined him\r\nbelow three hours, during which time the wine was taken out. The master\r\nentered some pipes next morning; but the sloop was seized for a false\r\nentry, and removed from the wharf under the guns of the _Romney_\r\nman-of-war. The removal of the sloop was highly resented, as implying\r\napprehension of a rescue, and every method was taken to interrupt the\r\nofficers in the execution of their business; and many persons determined\r\nto be revenged. A mob was soon collected; and Mr. Harrison, the\r\ncollector, Mr. Hallowell, the comptroller, Mr. Irving, the inspector of\r\nimports and exports, and a son of the collector, very narrowly escaped\r\nwith their lives. The mob proceeded to the houses of the collector and\r\ncomptroller, and having broken their windows, and those of the\r\ninspector-general, they next took and dragged the collector's (pleasure)\r\nboat through the town and burned it on the common. These outrages\r\ninduced the Custom-house officers to take refuge, first on board the\r\n_Romney_ man-of-war and afterwards in Castle William.\"[305]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Dr. Franklin states the affair as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th of June a seizure was made of a sloop fastened to the\r\nwharf, by an armed force, and the seizure carried by violence to the\r\nman-of-war. That this seizure was made with every circumstance of\r\nviolence and insult which could irritate a mob, is proved by the oaths\r\nof thirteen eye-witnesses whose credibility has never been impeached.\r\nUnhappily, the irritation succeeded but too well. The collector and\r\ncomptroller who made the seizure in that manner were treated with great\r\nindignity and personal injury by the mob.\"[306]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, productive of more intense and general excitement,\r\nif possible, and which transpired very shortly after the seizure and\r\ndetention of the sloop _Liberty_, was the impressment of some seamen\r\nbelonging to the town by the captain of the man-of-war _Romney_. This\r\nwas done, as alleged, in violation of an Act of Parliament for the\r\nencouragement of trade to America--6 Anne, chap. xxvii., section\r\n9--which says:\r\n\r\n\"No mariner or other person who shall serve on board, or be retained to\r\nserve on board, any privateer or trading ship or vessel that shall be\r\nemployed in any port of America, nor any mariner or person being on\r\nshore in any port thereof, shall be liable to be impressed or taken\r\naway by any officer or officers belonging to her Majesty's ships of\r\nwar.\" To prevent the tumults which were feared from such a flagrant and\r\ndangerous infraction of the law, a legal town-meeting was called, in\r\nwhich the inhabitants assembled petitioned the Governor to interpose and\r\nprevent such outrages upon the rights and liberties of the people; but\r\nthe Governor declined to interfere--stated that he had no control over\r\nhis Majesty's ships of war--that he would, however, use his utmost\r\nendeavours to get the impressing of men for the King's ships of war so\r\nregulated as to avoid all the inconveniences to the town which the\r\npetitioners apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these excitements and discontents, so threatening and\r\ndangerous without some form of expression, many of the peace-loving and\r\nrespectable inhabitants of Boston urged the Governor to convene the\r\nLegislature, but he refused without a command from the King. The select\r\nmen of Boston then proposed to the several towns and townships of the\r\ncolony the election of a Convention, to meet in Boston the 22nd of\r\nSeptember, \"to deliberate on constitutional measures to obtain redress\r\nof their grievances.\" Ninety-six towns and eight districts elected\r\ndelegates to the Convention, which sat four days; \"disclaimed any\r\nlegislative authority, petitioned the Governor, made loyal professions,\r\nexpressed their aversion to standing armies, to tumults and disorders,\r\ntheir readiness to assist in suppressing riots and preserving the peace;\r\nrecommended patience and good order; and after a short session\r\ndissolved.\"[307]\r\n\r\nThe day before the close of this Convention, it was announced that three\r\nmen-of-war and transports had arrived at Boston harbour with about 900\r\ntroops, and the fleet next day came to anchor near Castle William. The\r\nCommissioners of Customs and their friends had solicited the stationing\r\nof a regular force in the town.\r\n\r\n\"The ships having taken a station which commanded the town, the troops,\r\nunder cover of the cannon of the ships, landed without molestation, and\r\nto the number of 700 men marched, with muskets charged and bayonets\r\nfixed, martial music, and the usual military parade, into the common.\r\nIn the evening the Select Men of Boston were required to quarter the\r\nregiments in the town; but they absolutely refused. A temporary shelter,\r\nhowever, in Faneuil Hall was permitted to one regiment that was without\r\ncamp equipage. The next day the State House, by the order of the\r\nGovernor, was opened for the reception of the soldiers; and after the\r\nquarters were settled, two field pieces with the main guard were\r\nstationed just in its front. Everything was calculated to excite the\r\nindignation of the inhabitants. The lower floor of the State House,\r\nwhich had been used by gentlemen and merchants as an exchange; the\r\nrepresentatives' chamber, the Court-house, Faneuil Hall--places with\r\nwhich were associated ideas of justice and freedom, as well as of\r\nconvenience and utility--were now filled with regular soldiers. Guards\r\nwere placed at the doors of the State House, through which the Council\r\nmust pass in going to their own chamber. The common was covered with\r\ntents. The soldiers were constantly marching and countermarching to\r\nrelieve the guards. The sentinels challenged the inhabitants as they\r\npassed. The Lord's day was profaned, and the devotion of the sanctuary\r\nwas disturbed by the sound of drums and other military music. There was\r\nevery appearance of a garrisoned town. The colonists felt disgusted and\r\ninjured, but not overawed, by the obtruded soldiery. After the troops\r\nhad obtained quarters, the Council were required to provide barracks for\r\nthem, agreeably to Act of Parliament, but they resolutely declined any\r\nmeasure which might be construed into submission to that Act. Several\r\nlarge transports arrived at Boston from Cork, having on board part of\r\nthe 64th and 65th British regiments, under Colonels MacKay and Pomeroy;\r\nthe object of which was to protect the revenue officers in the\r\ncollection of duties.\"[308]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things in Massachusetts and in other colonies at\r\nthe close of the year 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: The following are the concluding paragraphs of this\r\npetition to the King, dated 20th January, 1768:\r\n\r\n\"With great sincerity permit us to assure your Majesty, that your\r\nsubjects of this province ever have and will continue to acknowledge\r\nyour Majesty's High Court of Parliament as the supreme legislative power\r\nof the whole empire, the superintending authority of which is clearly\r\nadmitted in all cases that can consist with the fundamental rights of\r\nnature and the constitution, to which your Majesty's happy subjects in\r\nall parts of your empire conceive they have a just and equitable claim.\r\n\r\n\"It is with the deepest concern that your humble suppliants would\r\nrepresent to your Majesty, that your Parliament, the rectitude of whose\r\nintentions is never to be questioned, has thought proper to pass divers\r\nActs imposing taxes on your Majesty's subjects in America, with the sole\r\nand express purpose of raising a revenue. If your Majesty's subjects\r\nhere shall be deprived of the honour and privilege of voluntarily\r\ncontributing their aid to your Majesty in supporting your government and\r\nauthority in the province, and defending and securing your rights and\r\nterritories in America, which they have always hitherto done with the\r\nutmost cheerfulness: if these Acts of Parliament shall remain in force,\r\nand your Majesty's Commons in Great Britain shall continue to exercise\r\nthe power of granting the property of their fellow-subjects in this\r\nprovince, your people must then regret their unhappy fate in having only\r\nthe name left of free subjects.\r\n\r\n\"With all humility we conceive that a representation of your Majesty's\r\nsubjects of this province in the Parliament, considering their local\r\ncircumstances, is utterly impracticable. Your Majesty has heretofore\r\nbeen graciously pleased to order your requisitions to be laid before the\r\nrepresentatives of your people in the General Assembly, who have never\r\nfailed to afford the necessary aid to the extent of their ability, and\r\nsometimes beyond it; and it would be ever grievous to your Majesty's\r\nfaithful subjects to be called upon in a way that should appear to them\r\nto imply a distrust of their most ready and willing compliance.\r\n\r\n\"Under the most sensible impressions of your Majesty's wise and paternal\r\ncare for the remotest of your faithful subjects, and in full dependence\r\non the royal declarations in the Charter of this province, we most\r\nhumbly beseech your Majesty to take our present unhappy circumstances\r\nunder your Royal consideration, and afford us relief in such manner as\r\nin your Majesty's great wisdom and clemency shall seem meet.\" (Prior\r\nDocuments, etc., pp. 175-7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: Prior Documents, etc., p. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Prior Documents, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Prior Documents, etc., p. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: American Annals, etc., Vol II., pp. 157, 158; the\r\nauthority given is Gordon, Vol. I., pp. 168-172.

It the people of England could but look into the town, they would\r\nsmile to see the utmost good order and observance of the laws, and that\r\nthis mighty armament has no other rebellion to subdue than what has\r\nexisted in the brain and letters of the inveterate G------r B-----d\r\n(Governor Barnard), and the detested Commiss (Commissioners) of the\r\nBoard of Cust--s (Customs). What advantage the Court of Versailles may\r\ntake of the present policy of the British Ministry can be better\r\ndetermined hereafter.\" (pp. 177, 178.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1769--UNJUST IMPUTATIONS OF PARLIAMENT ON THE LOYALTY OF THE\r\nCOLONISTS, AND MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR JUST AND LOYAL PETITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest proceedings of this year in regard to the American colonies\r\ntook place in the British Parliament. In all the resolutions, protests,\r\naddresses, and petitions which had been adopted by American Assemblies\r\nand at town meetings, asserting the exclusive right of the colonists to\r\ntax themselves, and against taxation without representation by the\r\nBritish Parliament, they professed heartfelt loyalty to the King, and\r\ndisclaimed all views of independence; while in England the Parliament\r\nasserted unlimited supremacy in and over the colonies, and the Royal\r\nspeeches, as well as the resolutions and addresses adopted by the Lords\r\nand Commons, represented the colonies as being in a state of\r\ndisobedience to law and government, adopting measures subversive of the\r\nconstitution, and manifesting a disposition to throw off all allegiance\r\nto the mother country. The House of Lords passed resolutions censuring\r\nthe resolutions and proceedings of the Massachusetts House of\r\nRepresentatives, pronouncing the election of deputies to sit in\r\nConvention, and the meeting of that Convention at Boston, daring insults\r\nto his Majesty's authority, and audacious usurpations of the powers of\r\nGovernment; yet, as has been seen, that Convention expressly disclaimed\r\nany assumption of government, and simply expressed the grievances\r\ncomplained of, prayed for their redress, declared their loyalty to the\r\nKing, and recognition of the supreme authority of Parliament according\r\nto the constitution, and quietly dissolved. But the House of Commons\r\ndeclared concurrence in the resolutions of the Lords; and both Houses,\r\nin their address to the King, endorsed the measures of his Ministers,\r\ndeclared their readiness to give effectual support to such further\r\nmeasures as might be found necessary to execute the laws in\r\nMassachusetts Bay, and prayed his Majesty \"to direct the Governor\r\n(Barnard) to take the most effectual methods for procuring the fullest\r\ninformation touching all treason or misprision of treason within the\r\nGovernment since the 30th day of December, 1767, and to transmit the\r\nsame, together with the names of the persons who were most active in the\r\ncommission of such offences, to one of the Secretaries of State, in\r\norder that his Majesty might issue a special commission for inquiring,\r\nhearing and determining the said offences, _within the realm of Great\r\nBritain_, pursuant to the provision of the statute of the 35th of Henry\r\nthe Eighth.\"\r\n\r\nThe holding of town-meetings and their election of deputies, etc., were\r\nas much provided for in the provincial laws as the meeting and\r\nproceedings of the House of Representatives, or as are the meetings and\r\nproceedings of town, and township, and county municipal councils in\r\nCanada. The wholesale denunciations of disloyalty and treason against\r\nthe people of a country was calculated to exasperate and produce the\r\nvery feelings imputed; and the proposal of the two Houses of Parliament\r\nto make the Governor of Massachusetts Bay a detective and\r\ninformer-general against persons opposed to his administration and the\r\nmeasures of the British Ministry, and the proposition to have them\r\narrested and brought 3,000 miles over the ocean to England, for trial\r\nbefore a special commission, for treason or misprision of treason, show\r\nwhat unjust, unconstitutional, and foolish things Parliaments as well as\r\nindividuals may sometimes perpetrate. Nothing has more impressed the\r\nwriter, in going through this protracted war of words, preliminary to\r\nthe unhappy war of swords, than the great superiority, even as literary\r\ncompositions, much more as State documents, of the addresses and\r\npetitions of the Colonial Assemblies, and even public meetings, and the\r\nletters of their representatives, when compared with the dispatches of\r\nthe British Ministry of that day and the writings of their partizans.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions and joint address of the Houses of Parliament, which\r\nwere adopted in February, reached America in April, and gave great\r\noffence to the colonists generally instead of exciting terror,\r\nespecially the part of the address which proposed bringing alleged\r\noffenders from Massachusetts to be tried at a tribunal in Great Britain.\r\nMassachusetts had no General Assembly at that time, as Governor Barnard\r\nhad dissolved the last Assembly, and the time prescribed by the Charter\r\nfor calling one had not arrived; but the House of Burgesses of the old,\r\nloyal Church of England colony of Virginia took the state of all the\r\ncolonies into serious consideration, passed several resolutions, and\r\ndirected their Speaker to transmit them without delay to the Speakers of\r\nthe Assemblies of all the colonies on the continent for their\r\nconcurrence. In these resolutions the House of Burgesses declare--\"That\r\nthe sole right of imposing taxes on the inhabitants of this colony is\r\nnow, and ever hath been, legally and constitutionally vested in the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, with consent of the Council, and of the King or his\r\nGovernor for the time being; that it is the privilege of the inhabitants\r\nto petition their Sovereign for redress of grievances, and that it is\r\nlawful to procure the concurrence of his Majesty's other colonies in\r\ndutiful addresses, praying the Royal interposition in favour of the\r\nviolated rights of America; that all trials for treason, misprision of\r\ntreason, or for any felony or crime whatsoever, committed by any persons\r\nresiding in any colony, ought to be in his Majesty's courts within said\r\ncolony, and that the seizing of any person residing in the colony,\r\nsuspected of any crime whatsoever committed therein, and sending such\r\nperson to places beyond the sea to be tried, is highly derogatory of the\r\nrights of British subjects, as thereby the inestimable privilege of\r\nbeing tried by jury from the vicinage, as well as the liberty of\r\nproducing witnesses on such trial, will be taken away from the accused.\"\r\n\r\nThe House agreed also to an address to his Majesty, which stated, in the\r\nstyle of loyalty and real attachment to the Crown, a deep conviction\r\nthat the complaints of the colonists were well founded. The next day\r\nLord Botetourt, the Governor of Virginia, dissolved the House in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, I\r\nhave heard of your resolves, and augur ill of their effects. You have\r\nmade it my duty to dissolve you; and you are dissolved accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of South Carolina adopted resolutions similar to those of\r\nVirginia, as did the Lower House of Maryland and the Delaware counties,\r\nand the Assembly of North Carolina, and was on that account dissolved by\r\nGovernor Tyron. Towards the close of the year, the Assembly of New York\r\npassed resolutions in concurrence with those of Virginia. The members of\r\nthe House of Burgesses of Virginia, and of the Assembly of North\r\nCarolina, after their dissolution, met as private gentlemen, chose for\r\nmoderators their late Speakers, and adopted resolutions against\r\nimporting British goods. This was followed by other colonies, and the\r\nnon-importation agreement became general. Boston had entered into the\r\nnon-importation agreement as early as August, 1768, which was soon after\r\nadopted in Salem, the city of New York, and the province of Connecticut;\r\nbut the agreement was not generally entered into until after the\r\nVirginia resolutions. \"The meetings of non-importation associations were\r\nregularly held in the various provinces. Committees were appointed to\r\nexamine all vessels arriving from Britain. Censures were freely passed\r\non such as refused to concur in these associations, and their names were\r\npublished in the newspapers as enemies of their country. The regular\r\nActs of the Provincial Assemblies were not so much respected and obeyed\r\nas the decrees of these Committees.\"[309]\r\n\r\nGovernor Barnard could not delay calling the General Assembly of\r\nMassachusetts beyond the time prescribed by the Charter for its meeting\r\nin May; and when it met, its first act was to appoint a Committee to\r\nwait on the Governor, and represent to him \"that an armament by sea and\r\nland investing this metropolis, and a military guard with cannon pointed\r\nat the door of the State House, where the Assembly is held, are\r\ninconsistent with the dignity and freedom with which they have a right\r\nto deliberate, consult, and determine,\" and added, \"They expect that\r\nyour Excellency will, as his Majesty's representative, give effectual\r\norders for the removal of the above-mentioned forces by sea and land out\r\nof this port, and the gates of this city, during the session of the said\r\nAssembly.\" The Governor answered: \"Gentlemen, I have no authority over\r\nhis Majesty's ships in this port, or his troops within this town, nor\r\ncan I give any orders for the removal of the same.\" The House persisted\r\nin declining to do business while surrounded with an armed force, and\r\nthe Governor at length adjourned it to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of July the Governor sent a message to the House with\r\naccounts of expenditures already incurred in quartering his Majesty's\r\ntroops, desiring funds for their payment, and requiring a provision for\r\nthe quartering of the troops in the town and on Castle Island,\r\n\"according to Act of Parliament.\" The next day, among other things, the\r\nHouse passed the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"That a general discontent on account of the Revenue Acts, an\r\nexpectation of the sudden arrival of a military power to enforce said\r\nActs, an apprehension of the troops being quartered upon the\r\ninhabitants, the General Court (or Assembly) dissolved, the Governor\r\nrefusing to call a new one, and the people almost reduced to a state of\r\ndespair, rendered it highly expedient and necessary for the people to\r\nconvene their (town) committees to associate (in convention), consult,\r\nand advise the best means to promote peace and good order; to present\r\ntheir united complaints to the Throne, and jointly to pray for the Royal\r\ninterposition in favour of their violated rights; nor can this procedure\r\npossibly be illegal, as they expressly disclaim all governmental acts.\r\n\r\n\"That the establishment of a standing army in this colony, in time of\r\npeace, is an invasion of national rights.\r\n\r\n\"That a standing army is not known as a part of the British\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\"That sending an armed force into the colony, under pretence of\r\nassisting the civil authority, is highly dangerous to the people,\r\nunprecedented and unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July the Governor sent a message to the House requesting\r\nan explicit answer to his message of the 6th, as to whether the House\r\nwould or would not make provision for quartering the troops. After\r\nanxious deliberation, the unusually full House of 107 members present\r\nunanimously answered:\r\n\r\n\"As representatives, by the Royal Charter and the nature of our trust,\r\nwe are only empowered to grant such aids as are reasonable, of which we\r\nare free and independent judges, at liberty to follow the dictates of\r\nour own understanding, without regard to the mandates of another. Your\r\nExcellency must, therefore, excuse us in this express declaration that\r\nas we cannot, consistently with our honour or interest, and much less\r\nwith the duty we owe to our constituents, so we shall never make\r\nprovision for the purposes mentioned in your messages.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Barnard rejoined, in his last words to the Assembly, \"To his\r\nMajesty, and if he pleases to his Parliament, must be referred your\r\ninvasion of the rights of the Imperial sovereignty. By your own acts you\r\nwill be judged. Your publications are plain and explicit, and need no\r\ncomment.\" And he prorogued the Assembly until the 10th day of January,\r\n1770. He wrote to Lord Hillsborough: \"Their last message exceeds\r\neverything.\" Three weeks afterwards, the 1st of August, unexpectedly to\r\nhimself, Barnard was recalled. He had expected to be appointed Governor\r\nof Virginia; but on his arrival in England he found that the British\r\nMinisters had promised the London-American merchants that they would\r\nnever employ him again in America.[310] He answered the purposes of the\r\ncorrupt Ministerial oligarchy in England, to mislead the Sovereign on\r\none hand and oppress the colonists on the other. But for him there would\r\nhave been no ships of war or military sent to Boston; no conflicts\r\nbetween the citizens and soldiers; probably no revolutionary war.\r\nBarnard's departure from Boston was signalized by the ringing of bells,\r\nand firing of cannon, and bonfires at night. He was succeeded in the\r\ngovernment by Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, a man who had rendered\r\ngreat service to his native country by his History, and his labours in\r\nthe Legislature for ten years, but who had become extremely unpopular by\r\nhis secret support of the English Revenue Acts and duplicate policy of\r\nBarnard, whom he at length equalled in avarice and deception, and\r\ngreatly excelled in ability.\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective and least objectionable means of obtaining the\r\nrepeal of the Revenue Acts was the agreement not to purchase or import\r\ngoods of British manufacture or goods imported from British ports. At\r\nbest the revenues arising from the operation of these Acts would not\r\namount to £20,000 a year. They were maintained in England as a badge of\r\nthe absolute authority of Parliament; they were resisted in America as a\r\nbadge of colonial independence of taxation--without representation.\r\nThere was no crime, political or moral, in refusing to buy goods of any\r\nkind, much less goods burdened with what they considered unlawful\r\nduties. Mr. Bancroft remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The agreement of non-importation originated in New York, where it was\r\nrigidly carried into effect. No acrimony appeared; every one, without so\r\nmuch as a single dissentient, approved of the combination as wise and\r\nlegal; persons in the highest stations declared against the Revenue\r\nActs, and the Governor wished their repeal. His acquiescence in the\r\nassociation for coercing that repeal led the moderate men among the\r\npatriots of New York to plan a union of the colonies in an American\r\nParliament (similar to that which now exists in the Dominion of Canada),\r\npreserving the Governments of the several colonies, and having the\r\nmembers of the General Parliament chosen by their respective\r\nLegislatures. They were preparing the greatest work of their generation,\r\nto be matured at a later day. Their confidence of immediate success\r\nassisted to make them alike disinclined to independence and firm in\r\ntheir expectation of bringing England to reason by suspending their\r\nmutual trade.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Boston, stimulated by the unanimity and scrupulous\r\nfidelity of New York, were impatient that a son of Barnard, two sons of\r\nHutchinson, and about five others, would not accede to the agreement. At\r\na great meeting of merchants in Faneuil Hall, Hancock proposed to send\r\nfor Hutchinson's two sons, hinting, what was true, that the\r\nLieutenant-Governor was himself a partner with them in their late\r\nextraordinary importations of tea. As the best means of coercion, it was\r\nvoted not to purchase anything of the recusants. Subscription papers to\r\nthat effect were carried around from house to house, and everybody\r\ncomplied.\"\r\n\r\n\"A letter from New York next invited Boston to extend the agreement\r\nagainst importing indefinitely, until every Act imposing duties should\r\nbe repealed; and on the 17th (of October), by the great influence of\r\nMolineux, Otis, Samuel Adams, and William Cooper, this new form was\r\nadopted.\"[311] The opposition in Boston to the reception of goods from\r\nEngland became so general and determined, that even Governor Hutchinson\r\nquailed before it, and the soldiers stood silent and inactive witnesses\r\nof it. Mr. Bancroft says:\r\n\r\n\"Early in October (1769), a vessel laden with goods, shipped by English\r\nhouses themselves, arrived in Boston. The military officers had been\r\nspeculating on what would be done, and Colonel Dalrymple stood ready to\r\nprotect the factors. But his assistance was not demanded. Hutchinson\r\npermitted the merchants to reduce the consignees to submission, and even\r\nto compel an English adventurer to re-embark his goods. One and another\r\nof the Boston recusants yielded; even the two sons of Hutchinson\r\nhimself, by their father's direction, gave up 18 chests of tea, and\r\nentered fully into the (non-importation) agreement. Four still held out,\r\nand their names, with those of the two sons of Hutchinson, whose\r\nsincerity was questioned, stood recorded as infamous on the journals of\r\nthe town of Boston. On the 15th another ship arrived; again the troops\r\nlooked on as bystanders, and witnessed the complete victory of the\r\npeople.\"[312]\r\n\r\nBut in the following month, November, a new turn was given to public\r\nthought, and new feelings of joy were inspired throughout America, by a\r\ndispatch from Lord Hillsborough to the King's personal friend, Lord\r\nBotetourt, Governor of Virginia, promising the repeal of the obnoxious\r\nRevenue Acts, and to impose no further taxes on the colonies. Lord\r\nHillsborough says:\r\n\r\n\"I can take upon me to assure you, notwithstanding information to the\r\ncontrary from men with factious and seditious views, that his Majesty's\r\npresent Administration have at no time entertained a design to propose\r\nto Parliament to lay any further taxes upon America for the purpose of\r\nraising a revenue; and that it is at present their intention to propose,\r\nthe next session of Parliament, to take off the duties upon glass, paper\r\nand colours, upon consideration of such duties having been laid contrary\r\nto the true principles of commerce.\" Lord Hillsborough further informed\r\nLord Botetourt that \"his Majesty relied upon his prudence and fidelity\r\nto make such explanation of his Majesty's measures as would tend to\r\nremove prejudices and to re-establish mutual confidence and affection\r\nbetween the mother country and the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nIn Lord Botetourt's address to the Virginia Assembly, transmitting a\r\ncopy of the dispatch, he said:\r\n\r\n\"It may possibly be objected that as his Majesty's present\r\nAdministration are not immortal, their successors may be inclined to\r\nattempt to undo what the present Ministers shall have attempted to\r\nperform; and to that objection I can give but this answer: that it is my\r\nfirm opinion that the plan I have stated to you will certainly take\r\nplace, and that it will never be departed from; and so determined am I\r\nfor ever to abide by it, that I will be content to be declared infamous\r\nif I do not, to the last hour of my life, at all times, in all places,\r\nand upon all occasions, exert every power with which I either am, or\r\never shall be, legally invested, in order to obtain and maintain for the\r\ncontinent of America that satisfaction which I have been authorized to\r\npromise this day by the confidential servants of our gracious Sovereign,\r\nwho, to my certain knowledge, rates his honour so high, that he would\r\nrather part with his crown than preserve it by deceit.\"\r\n\r\nThese assurances were received by the Virginians with transports of joy,\r\nviewing them as they did as abandoning, never to be resumed, the design\r\nof raising a revenue in America by Act of Parliament. The General\r\nAssembly of Virginia, in reply to Lord Botetourt's address, thus\r\nexpressed themselves:\r\n\r\n\"We are sure our most gracious Sovereign, under whatever changes may\r\nhappen in his confidential servants, will remain immutable in the ways\r\nof truth and justice, and that he is incapable of deceiving his faithful\r\nsubjects; and we esteem your lordship's information not only as\r\nwarranted, but even sanctified by the Royal word.\"[313]\r\n\r\nIt was understood and expected on all sides that the unproductive tax on\r\ntea would be repealed with the other articles enumerated in the Revenue\r\nActs. Such was the wish of Governor Botetourt; such was the advice of\r\nEden, the newly appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Maryland; Golden, who\r\nnow administered the government of New York, on account of the death of\r\nMore, assured the Legislature of the greatest probability that the late\r\nduties imposed by authority of Parliament, so much to the\r\ndissatisfaction of the colonies, would be taken off the ensuing\r\nsession.[314]\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" says Mr. Bancroft, \"all America confined its issue with Great\r\nBritain to the single question of the Act imposing a duty on tea.\" \"Will\r\nnot a repeal of all other duties satisfy the colonists?\" asked one of\r\nthe Ministerial party of Franklin in London. And he frankly answered, 'I\r\nthink not; it is not the sum paid in the duty on tea that is complained\r\nof as a burden, but the principle of the Act expressed in the preamble.'\r\nThis faithful advice was communicated to the Ministry; but what effect\r\ncould it produce when Hillsborough administered the colonies, with\r\nBarnard for his counsellor?[315]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chapter iii., p. 359.\r\n\r\nThe following are the resolutions subscribed by the merchants and\r\ntraders of New York, dated 27th August, 1768:\r\n\r\nI.

His parsimony went to\r\nthe extreme of meanness; his avarice was insatiable and restless. So\r\nlong as he connived at smuggling, he reaped a harvest in that way; when\r\nGrenville's sternness inspired alarm, it was his study to make the most\r\nmoney out of forfeitures and penalties. Professing to respect the\r\nCharter, he was unwearied in zeal for its subversion; declaring his\r\nopposition to taxation by Parliament, he urged it with all his power.\r\nAsserting most solemnly that he had never asked for troops, his letters\r\nreveal his perpetual importunity for ships of war and an armed force.\r\nHis reports were often false--partly with design, partly from the\r\ncredulity of panic. He placed everything in the most unfavourable light,\r\nand was ready to tell every tale and magnify trivial rumours into acts\r\nof treason. He was despondent when conciliation prevailed in England.\r\nThe officers of the army and navy despised him for his cowardice and\r\nduplicity, and did not conceal their contempt.\" (History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. VI., Chap. xli., p. 291.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: History of the United States, Vol. VI., Chap. xlii., pp.\r\n308, 309, 311.

The dispute about the Billeting Act had ceased in\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania; the Legislature of New York, pleased with\r\nthe permission to issue colonial bills of credit, disregarded the appeal\r\nfrom Macdougall to the betrayed inhabitants of that city and colony, and\r\nsanctioned a compromise by a majority of one. South Carolina was\r\ncommercially the most closely connected with England. The annual exports\r\nfrom Charleston reached in value about two and a quarter millions of\r\ndollars, of which three-fourths went directly or indirectly to England.\r\nBut however closely the ties of interest bound Carolina to England, the\r\npeople were high-spirited; and, notwithstanding the great inconvenience\r\nto their trade, they persevered in the strict observance of their\r\n(non-importation) association, looking with impatient anxiety for the\r\ndesired repeal of the Act complained of.\"--_Ib._, pp. 317, 318.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: History of the United States, Vol. VI., Chap, xlii., p.\r\n318.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1770--AN EVENTFUL EPOCH--EXPECTATIONS OF RECONCILIATION AND\r\nUNION DISAPPOINTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the year of bloody collision and parliamentary decision, which\r\ndetermined the future relations between Great Britain and the American\r\ncolonies. Dr. Ramsay observes:\r\n\r\n\"From the Royal and Ministerial assurances given in favour of America in\r\n1769, and the subsequent repeal in 1770 of five-sixths of the duties\r\nwhich had been imposed in 1767, together with the consequent renewal of\r\nthe mercantile intercourse between Great Britain and her colonies, many\r\nhoped that the contention between the two countries was finally closed.\r\nIn all the provinces, excepting Massachusetts, appearances seemed to\r\nfavour that opinion. Many incidents operated there to the prejudice of\r\nthat harmony which had begun elsewhere to return. Stationing a military\r\nforce among them was a fruitful source of uneasiness. The royal army had\r\nbeen brought thither with the avowed design of enforcing submission to\r\nthe mother country. Speeches from the Throne and addresses from both\r\nHouses of Parliament had taught them to look upon the inhabitants of\r\nMassachusetts as a factious, turbulent people, who aimed at throwing off\r\nall subordination to Great Britain. They, on the other hand, were\r\naccustomed to look upon the soldiery as instruments of tyranny, sent on\r\npurpose to dragoon them out of their liberties.\r\n\r\n\"Reciprocal insults soured the tempers, and mutual injuries embittered\r\nthe passions of the opposite parties. Some fiery spirits, who thought it\r\nan indignity to have troops quartered among them, were constantly\r\nexciting the townspeople to quarrel with the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"On the 2nd of March, 1770, a fray took place near Mr. Gray's ropewalk,\r\nbetween a private soldier of the 20th Regiment and an inhabitant. The\r\nformer was supported by his comrades, the latter by the ropemakers, till\r\nseveral on both sides were involved in the consequences. On the 5th a\r\nmore dreadful scene was presented. The soldiers when under arms were\r\npressed upon, insulted and pelted by the mob, armed with clubs, sticks,\r\nand snowballs covering stones. They were also dared to fire. In this\r\nsituation, one of the soldiers, who had received a blow, in resentment\r\nfired at the supposed aggressors. This was followed by a single\r\ndischarge from six others. Three of the inhabitants were killed and five\r\nwere dangerously wounded. The town was immediately in commotion. Such\r\nwere the temper, force, and number of the inhabitants, that nothing but\r\nan engagement to remove the troops out of the town, together with the\r\nadvice of moderate men, prevented the townsmen from falling on the\r\nsoldiers. Capt. Preston, who commanded, and the party who fired on the\r\ninhabitants, were committed to jail, and afterwards tried. The captain\r\nand six of the men were acquitted. Two were brought in guilty of\r\nmanslaughter (and were lightly punished). _It appeared on the trial that\r\nthe soldiers were abused, insulted, threatened, and pelted before they\r\nfired._ It was also proved that only seven guns were fired by the eight\r\nprisoners. These circumstances induced the jury to give a favourable\r\nverdict. The result of the trial reflected great honour on John Adams\r\nand Josiah Quincy, the counsel for the prisoners (promising young\r\nlawyers and popular leaders), and also on the integrity of the jury, who\r\nventured to give an upright verdict in defiance of popular\r\nopinion.\"[316]\r\n\r\nA further hindrance to returning harmony in Massachusetts, as in the\r\nother colonies, was another ill-judged act of the British Ministers in\r\nmaking the Governor and judges wholly independent of the province in\r\nregard to their salaries, which had always been paid by the local\r\nLegislature in annual grants, but which were now, for the first time,\r\npaid by the Crown. The House of Assembly remonstrated against this\r\ninnovation, which struck at the very heart of public liberty, by making\r\nthe administrator of the government, and the courts of law, wholly\r\nindependent of the people, and wholly dependent on the Crown, all\r\nholding their offices during pleasure of the Crown, and depending upon\r\nit alone for both the amount and payment of their salaries, and that\r\npayment out of a revenue raised by taxing the people without their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThe House addressed the Governor and judges to know whether they would\r\nreceive their salaries as heretofore, by grants of the Legislature, or\r\nas stipends from the Crown. Three out of the four judges announced that\r\nthey would receive their salaries as heretofore, by grants from the\r\nlocal Legislature; but Governor Hutchinson and Chief Justice Oliver\r\nannounced that they would receive their salaries from the Crown. They\r\ntherefore became more and more odious to the inhabitants, while the\r\ndiscussion of the new question of the relations of the Executive and\r\nJudiciary to the people, upon the grounds of public freedom and the\r\nimpartial administration of justice, greatly increased the strength of\r\nthe opposition and the importance of the local House of Representatives\r\nas the counterpart of the House of Commons, and as guardians of the\r\nrights of the people.\r\n\r\nAt an early period of Canadian history, the salaries of governors and\r\njudges were determined and paid by the Crown, out of what was called a\r\ncasual and territorial revenue, independent of the representatives of\r\nthe people, and the judges held their places during pleasure; but after\r\nmuch agitation, and a determined popular struggle of several years, a\r\ncivil list for both the governors and judges was agreed upon and voted\r\nby the Legislature. The tenure of the offices of judges was made that of\r\ngood behaviour, instead of pleasure; and executive councillors and heads\r\nof departments were made dependent upon the confidence of the\r\nLegislature, with the control of revenues of every kind raised in the\r\ncountry; since which time there have been peace, loyalty, and progress\r\nthroughout the provinces of the Canadian Dominion.\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the affairs of the colonies as discussed and decided upon\r\nin the British Parliament, which met the 9th of January, 1770. The King,\r\nin opening Parliament, expressed his regret that his endeavours to\r\ntranquillize America had not been attended with the desired success, and\r\nthat combinations had been formed to destroy the commercial connection\r\nbetween the colonies and the mother country. The opposition in both\r\nHouses of Parliament dwelt strongly on the prevailing discontents, both\r\nin England and in the colonies. Ministers, admitting these discontents,\r\nimputed them to the spirit of faction, the speeches and writings of\r\nagitators, and to petitions got up and circulated by their influence.\r\nLords Camden and Shelburne resigned, disapproving of the policy of the\r\nAdministration, as did soon after, on the 28th of January, 1770, the\r\nDuke of Grafton, First Lord of the Treasury, and was succeeded by Lord\r\nNorth as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lord Chatham, after an absence of\r\ntwo years, recovered sufficiently to make his clarion voice once more\r\nheard in the councils of the nation against official corruption, and in\r\ndefence of liberty and the rights of the colonies, the affairs of which\r\nnow occupied the attention of Parliament. The British manufacturers and\r\nmerchants who traded to America had sustained immense losses by the\r\nrejection of their goods, through the non-importing associations in\r\nAmerica, and apprehended ruin from their continuance, and therefore\r\npetitioned Parliament, stating their sufferings and imploring relief. On\r\nthe 5th of March Lord North introduced a Bill into the Commons for the\r\nrepeal of the whole of the Act of 1767, which imposed duties on glass,\r\nred lead, paper, and painters' colours, but retaining the preamble,\r\nwhich asserted the absolute authority of Parliament to bind the colonies\r\nin all cases whatsoever, and retaining, as an illustration of that\r\nauthority, the clause of the Act which imposed a duty on tea. He\r\nsaid:--\"The articles taxed being chiefly British manufactures, ought to\r\nhave been encouraged instead of being burdened with assessments. The\r\nduty on tea was continued, for maintaining the parliamentary right of\r\ntaxation. An impost of threepence in the pound could never be opposed by\r\nthe colonists, unless they were determined to rebel against Great\r\nBritain. Besides, a duty on that article, payable in England, and\r\namounting to nearly one shilling in the pound, was taken off on its\r\nexportation to America; so that the inhabitants of the colonies saved\r\nninepence in the pound. The members of the opposition, in both Houses,\r\nadvocated the repeal of the clause on tea, and predicted the\r\ninefficiency of the Bill should that clause be retained, and repeated\r\nthe arguments on the injustice and inexpediency of taxing America by Act\r\nof Parliament; but the Bill was carried by a large majority, and\r\nassented to by the King on the 12th of April.\"\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the obnoxious port duties of 1767 left no pretence for\r\nretaining the duty on _tea_ for raising a _revenue_, as the tea duty, at\r\nthe highest computation, would not exceed £16,000 a year; and when Lord\r\nNorth was pressed to relinquish that remaining cause of contention, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Has the repeal of the Stamp Act taught the Americans obedience? Has our\r\nlenity inspired them with moderation? Can it be proper, while they deny\r\nour legal right to tax them, to acquiesce in the argument of illegality,\r\nand by the repeal of the whole law to give up that honour? No; the most\r\nproper time to exert our right of taxation is when the right is refused.\r\nTo temporize is to yield; and the authority of the mother country, if it\r\nis now unsupported, will in reality be relinquished for ever. A total\r\nrepeal cannot be thought of till America is prostrate at our feet.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Pownall, who had spent many years in America, and had preceded\r\nBarnard as Governor of Massachusetts, moved an amendment, to include the\r\nrepeal of the duty on tea as well as on the articles included in the\r\noriginal motion of Lord North. In the course of his speech in support of\r\nthe amendment he said:\r\n\r\n\"If it be asked whether it will remove the apprehensions excited by your\r\nresolutions and address of the last year, for bringing to trial in\r\nEngland persons accused of treason in America? I answer, no. If it be\r\nasked, if this commercial concession would quiet the minds of the\r\nAmericans as to the political doubts and fears which have struck them to\r\nthe heart throughout the continent? I answer, no; so long as they are\r\nleft in doubt whether the Habeas Corpus Act, whether the Bill of Rights,\r\nwhether the Common Law as now existing in England, have any operation\r\nand effect in America, they cannot be satisfied. At this hour they know\r\nnot whether the civil constitution be not suspended and superseded by\r\nthe establishment of a military force. The Americans think that they\r\nhave, in return to all their applications, experienced a temper and\r\ndisposition that is unfriendly--that the enjoyment and exercise of the\r\ncommon rights of freemen have been refused to them. Never with these\r\nviews will they solicit the favour of this House; never more will they\r\nwish to bring before Parliament the grievances under which they conceive\r\nthemselves to labour. Deeply as they feel, they suffer and endure with\r\nalarming silence. For their liberty they are under no apprehensions. It\r\nwas first planted under the auspicious genius of the constitution, and\r\nit has grown up into a verdant and flourishing tree; and should any\r\nsevere strokes be aimed at the branches, and fate reduce it to the bare\r\nstock, it would only take deeper root, and spring out more hardy and\r\ndurable than before. They trust to Providence, and wait with firmness\r\nand fortitude the issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe statements of Governor Pownall were the result of long observation\r\nand experience in America, and practical knowledge of the colonists, and\r\nwere shown by results to be true to the letter, though treated with\r\nscorn by Lord North, and with aversion by the House of Commons, which\r\nrejected his amendment by a majority of 242 to 204.\r\n\r\nThe results of the combinations against the use of British manufactures\r\nwere illustrated this year by the candidates for the degree of Bachelor\r\nof Arts at Harvard College appearing dressed in black cloth manufactured\r\nwholly in New England. The general plan of non-importation of English\r\nmanufactured goods was now relinquished on the repeal of the duties\r\nimposed upon them; but the sentiment of the principal commercial towns\r\nwas against the importation of any tea from England. An association was\r\nformed not to drink tea until the Act imposing the duty should be\r\nrepealed. This was generally agreed to and observed throughout the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nBut the retaining of threepence in the pound on tea did not excite so\r\nmuch hostility in the colonies against the Parliament as might have been\r\nexpected. The Act of Parliament was virtually defeated, and the expected\r\nrevenue from tea failed because of the resolution of the colonial\r\nassociations of the people to use no tea, and of the merchants to\r\nimport none on which the duty was charged. The merchants found means to\r\nsmuggle, from countries to which the authority of Great Britain did not\r\nextend, a sufficient supply of tea for the tea-drinking colonists. Thus\r\nthe tea-dealers and tea-drinkers of America exercised their patriotism\r\nand indulged their taste--the one class making an additional threepence\r\na pound on tea by evading the Act, and the other class enjoying the\r\nluxury of tea as cheap as if no tea-duty Act of Parliament existed, and\r\nwith the additional relish of rendering such Act abortive. The\r\nfacilities for smuggling tea, arising from the great extent of the\r\nAmerican coasts, and the great number of harbours, and the universality\r\nof the British anti-tea associations, and the unity of popular sentiment\r\non the subject, rendered the Act of Parliament imposing the duty a\r\nmatter of sport rather than a measure of oppression even to the most\r\nscrupulous, as they regarded the Act unconstitutional, and every means\r\nlawful and right by which the obnoxious Act could be evaded and\r\ndefeated. It is probable that, in the ordinary course of things, the Act\r\nwould have become practically obsolete, and the relations of the\r\ncolonies to the mother country have settled down into quietness and\r\nfriendliness, but for another event, which not only revived with\r\nincreased intensity the original question of dispute, but gave rise to\r\nother occurrences that kindled the flame of the American revolution.\r\nThat event was the agreement between the Ministry and the East India\r\nCompany, which interfered with the natural and ordinary channels of\r\ntrade, and gave to that Company a monopoly of the tea trade of America.\r\nFrom the diminished exportation of tea from England to the colonies,\r\nthere were, in warehouses of the British East India Company, seventeen\r\nmillions of pounds of tea for which there was no demand. Lord North and\r\nhis colleagues were not willing to lose the expected revenue, as small\r\nas it must be at last from their American Tea Act, and the East India\r\nCompany were unwilling to lose the profits of their American tea trade.\r\n\r\nAn agreement was therefore entered into between the Ministry and the\r\nCompany, by which the Company, which was authorized by law to export\r\ntheir tea free of duty to all places whatsoever, could send their tea\r\ncheaper to the colonies than others who had to pay the exceptionable\r\nduty, and even cheaper than before it had been made a source of\r\nrevenue; \"for the duty taken off it when exported from Great Britain was\r\ngreater than that to be paid for it on its importation into the\r\ncolonies. Confident of success in finding a market for their tea, thus\r\nreduced in its price, and also of collecting a duty on its importation\r\nand sale in the colonies, the East India Company freighted several ships\r\nwith teas for the different colonies, and appointed agents (or\r\nconsignees) for its disposal.\" This measure united both the English and\r\nAmerican merchants in opposition to it upon selfish grounds of interest,\r\nand the colonists generally upon patriotic grounds. \"The merchants in\r\nEngland were alarmed at the losses that must come to themselves from the\r\nexportations of the East India Company, and from the sales going through\r\nthe hands of consignees. Letters were written to colonial patriots,\r\nurging their opposition to the project. The (American merchants)\r\nsmugglers, who were both numerous and powerful, could not relish a\r\nscheme which, by underselling them and taking a profitable branch of\r\nbusiness out of their hands, threatened a diminution of their gains. The\r\ncolonists were too suspicious of the designs of Great Britain to be\r\nimposed upon.\r\n\r\n\"The cry of endangered liberty once more excited an alarm from New\r\nHampshire to Georgia. The first opposition to the execution of the\r\nscheme adopted by the East India Company began with the American\r\nmerchants. They saw a profitable branch of their trade likely to be\r\nlost, and the benefits of it transferred to a company in Great Britain.\r\nThey felt for the wound that would be inflicted on their country's claim\r\nof exemption from parliamentary taxation; but they felt, with equal\r\nsensibility, for the losses they would sustain by the diversion of the\r\nstreams of commerce into unusual channels. Though the opposition\r\noriginated in the selfishness of the merchants, it did not end there.\r\nThe great body of the people, from principles of the purest patriotism,\r\nwere brought over to second their wishes. They considered the whole\r\nscheme as calculated to seduce them into an acquiescence with the views\r\nof Parliament for raising an American revenue. Much pains were taken to\r\nenlighten the colonists on this subject, and to convince them of the\r\neminent hazard to which their liberties were exposed.\r\n\r\n\"The provincial patriots insisted largely on the persevering\r\ndetermination of the parent state to establish her claim of taxation by\r\ncompelling the sale of tea in the colonies against the solemn\r\nresolutions and declared sense of the inhabitants, and that at a time\r\nwhen the commercial intercourse of the two countries was renewed, and\r\ntheir ancient harmony fast returning. The proposed vendors of the tea\r\nwere represented as revenue officers, employed in the collection of an\r\nunconstitutional tax imposed by Great Britain. The colonists contended\r\nthat, as the duty and the price of the commodity were inseparably\r\nblended, if the tea were sold every purchaser would pay a tax imposed by\r\nthe British Parliament as part of the purchase money.\"[317]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: Colonial History, Vol. I. Chap. iii., pp. 364, 365.\r\n\r\nSeveral American historians have sought to represent the soldiers as the\r\nfirst aggressors and offenders in this affair. The verdict of the jury\r\nrefutes such representations. The accuracy of Dr. Ramsay's statements\r\ngiven above cannot be fairly questioned; he was a member of South\r\nCarolina Legislature, an officer in the revolutionary army during the\r\nwhole war, and a personal friend of Washington. Mr. Hildreth says: \"A\r\nweekly paper, the 'Journal of the Times,' was filled with all sorts of\r\nstories, some true, but the greater part false or exaggerated, _on\r\npurpose to keep up prejudice against the soldiers. A mob of men and\r\nboys_, encouraged by the sympathy of the inhabitants, _made a constant\r\npractice to insult and provoke them_. The result to be expected soon\r\nfollowed. After numerous fights with straggling soldiers, a serious\r\ncollision at length took place: a picket guard of eight men, _provoked\r\nbeyond endurance by words and blows_, fired into a crowd, killed three\r\npersons and dangerously wounded five others.\" \"The story of the 'Boston\r\nmassacre,' for so it was called, exaggerated into a ferocious and\r\nunprovoked assault by brutal soldiers on a defenceless people, produced\r\neverywhere intense excitement. The officer and soldiers of the picket\r\nguard were indicted and tried for murder. They were defended, however,\r\nby John Adams and Josiah Quincy, two young lawyers, the most zealous\r\namong the popular leaders: and so clear a case was made in their behalf,\r\nthat they were all acquitted except two, who were found guilty of\r\nmanslaughter and slightly punished.\" (History of the United States,\r\nChap. xxix., pp. 554, 555, 556.)\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes states that \"the soldiers were pressed upon, insulted by the\r\npopulace, and dared to fire; one of them, who had received a blow, fired\r\nat the aggressors, and a single discharge from six others succeeded.\r\nThree of the inhabitants were killed and five dangerously wounded. The\r\ntown was instantly thrown into the greatest commotion. The drums beat to\r\narms, and thousands of the inhabitants assembled in the adjacent\r\nstreets. The next morning Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson summoned a\r\nCouncil; and while the subject was in discussion, a message was received\r\nfrom the town, which had convened in full assembly, declaring it to be\r\ntheir unanimous opinion 'that nothing can rationally be expected to\r\nrestore the peace of the town, and prevent blood and carnage, but the\r\nimmediate removal of the troops.' On an agreement to this measure, the\r\ncommotion subsided. Captain Preston, who commanded the party of\r\nsoldiers, was committed with them to jail, and all were afterwards\r\ntried. The captain and six of the men were acquitted. Two were brought\r\nin guilty of manslaughter. The result of the trial reflected great\r\nhonour on John Adams and Josiah Quincy, the counsel for the prisoners,\r\nand on the integrity of the jury.\" (Annals, etc., Vol. II., pp. 166,\r\n167.)\r\n\r\nHow much more honourable and reliable are these straightforward\r\nstatements of those American historians of the times, and the verdict of\r\neven a Boston jury, than the sophistical, elaborate, and reiterated\r\nefforts of Mr. Bancroft, in the 43rd and 44th chapters of his History,\r\nto implicate the soldiers as the provoking and guilty causes of the\r\ncollision, and impugning the integrity of the counsel for the\r\nprosecution, the court, and the jury.\r\n\r\nIn the Diary of J. Adams, Vol. II., p. 229, are the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Endeavours had been systematically pursued for many months by certain\r\nbusy characters to excite quarrels, rencounters, and combats, single or\r\ncompound, in the night, between the inhabitants of the lower class and\r\nthe soldiers, and at all risks to enkindle an immortal hatred between\r\nthem.\"--(Quoted by Mr. Hildreth, Vol. II., p. 409, in a note.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. I., Chap. iii., pp.\r\n370-372.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1771, 1772, 1773--THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S TEA REJECTED IN\r\nEVERY PROVINCE OF AMERICA--RESOLUTIONS OF A PUBLIC MEETING IN\r\nPHILADELPHIA THE MODEL FOR THOSE OF OTHER COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this unprecedented and unjustifiable combination between the British\r\nMinistry and East India Company to supersede the ordinary channels of\r\ntrade, and to force the sale of their tea in America, the returning\r\npeace and confidence between Great Britain and the colonies was\r\narrested, the colonial merchants of both England and America were roused\r\nand united in opposition to the scheme, meetings were held, associations\r\nwere formed, and hostility throughout all the colonies became so general\r\nand intense, that not a chest of the East India Company's tea was sold\r\nfrom New Hampshire to Georgia, and only landed in one instance, and then\r\nto rot in locked warehouses. In all cases, except in Boston, the\r\nconsignees were prevailed upon to resign; and in all cases except two,\r\nBoston and Charleston, the tea was sent back to England without having\r\nbeen landed. At Charleston, South Carolina, they allowed the tea to be\r\nlanded, but not sold; and it rotted in the cellars of the store-houses.\r\nAt Philadelphia, the consignees were forced to resign and send the tea\r\nback to England.[318] At New York they did the same. At Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire, they sent the tea away to Halifax. At Boston the consignees\r\nwere the sons of Hutchinson, the Governor, and he determined that it\r\nshould be landed and sold; while the mass of the people, led by\r\ncommittees of the \"Sons of Liberty,\" were equally determined that the\r\ntea should not be landed or sold.\r\n\r\nAs this Boston tea affair resulted in the passing of two Acts of\r\nParliament--the Bill for closing the port of Boston, and the Bill for\r\nsuspending the Charter and establishing a new constitution of government\r\nfor Massachusetts--and these were followed by an American Congress and a\r\ncivil war, I will state the transactions as narrated by three American\r\nhistorians, agreeing in the main facts, but differing in regard to\r\nincidental circumstances.\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsay narrates the general opposition to the scheme of the East\r\nIndia Company, and that at Boston in particular, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"As the time approached when the arrival of the tea ships might be soon\r\nexpected, such measures were adopted as seemed most likely to prevent\r\nthe landing of their cargoes. The tea consignees appointed by the East\r\nIndia Company were in several places compelled to relinquish their\r\nappointments, and no others could be found hardy enough to act in their\r\nstead. The pilots in the River Delaware were warned not to conduct any\r\nof the tea ships into their harbour. In New York, popular vengeance was\r\ndenounced against all who would contribute in any measure to forward the\r\nviews of the East India Company. The captains of the New York and\r\nPhiladelphia ships, being apprised of the resolution of the people, and\r\nfearing the consequence of landing a commodity charged with an odious\r\nduty, in violation of their declared public sentiments, concluded to\r\nreturn directly to Great Britain without making any entry at the\r\nCustom-house.\r\n\r\n\"It was otherwise in Massachusetts. The tea ships designed for the\r\nsupply of Boston were consigned to the sons, cousins, and particular\r\nfriends of Governor Hutchinson. When they were called upon to resign,\r\nthey answered that 'it was out of their power.' The Collector refused to\r\ngive a clearance unless the vessels were discharged of dutiable\r\narticles. The Governor refused to give a pass for the vessels unless\r\nproperly qualified for the Custom-house. The Governor likewise requested\r\nAdmiral Montague to guard the passages out of the harbour, and gave\r\norders to suffer no vessels, coasters excepted, to pass the fortress\r\nfrom the town without a pass signed by himself. From a combination of\r\nthese circumstances the return of the tea vessels from Boston was\r\nrendered impossible. The inhabitants then had no option but to prevent\r\nthe landing of the tea, to suffer it to be landed and depend on the\r\nunanimity of the people not to purchase it; to destroy the tea, or to\r\nsuffer a deep-laid scheme against their sacred liberties to take effect.\r\nThe first would have required incessant watching, by night as well as by\r\nday, for a period of time the duration of which no one could compute.\r\nThe second would have been visionary to childishness, by suspending the\r\nliberties of a growing country on the self-denial and discretion of\r\nevery tea-drinker in the province. They viewed the tea as the vehicle of\r\nan unconstitutional tax, and as inseparably associated with it. To avoid\r\nthe one, they resolved to destroy the other. About seventeen persons,\r\ndressed as Indians, repaired to the tea ships, broke open 342 chests of\r\ntea, and, without doing any other damage, discharged their contents into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, by the inflexibility of the Governor, the issue of this business\r\nwas different at Boston from what it was elsewhere. The whole cargoes of\r\ntea were returned from New York and Philadelphia; that which was sent to\r\nCharleston was landed and stored, but not offered for sale. Mr.\r\nHutchinson had repeatedly urged Government to be firm and persevering.\r\nHe could not, therefore, consistently with his honour, depart from a\r\nline of conduct he had so often and so strongly recommended to his\r\nsuperiors. He also believed that the inhabitants would not dare to\r\nperfect their engagements, and flattered himself that they would desist\r\nwhen the critical moment arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Admitting the rectitude of the American claims of exemption from\r\nparliamentary taxation, the destruction of the tea by the Bostonians was\r\nwarranted by the great law of self-preservation; for it was not possible\r\nfor them by any other means to discharge the duty they owed to their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"The event of this business was very different from what had been\r\nexpected in England. The colonists acted with so much union and system,\r\nthat there was not a single chest of any of the cargoes sent out by the\r\nEast India Company sold for their benefit.\"[319]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Holmes, in his Annals of America, says:\r\n\r\n\"The crisis now approached when the colonies were to decide whether they\r\nwould submit to be taxed by the British Parliament, or practically\r\nsupport their own principles and meet the consequences. One sentiment\r\nseems to have pervaded the entire continent. The new Ministerial plan\r\nwas universally considered as a direct attack on the liberties of the\r\ncolonists, which it was the duty of all to oppose. A violent ferment was\r\neverywhere excited; the Corresponding Committees were extremely active;\r\nand it was very generally declared that whoever should, directly or\r\nindirectly, countenance this dangerous invasion of their rights, is an\r\nenemy to his country. The East India Company, confident of finding a\r\nmarket for their tea, reduced as it now was in its price, freighted\r\nseveral ships to the colonies with that article, and appointed agents\r\nfor the disposal of it. Some cargoes were sent to New York, some to\r\nPhiladelphia, some to Charleston (South Carolina), and three to Boston.\r\nThe inhabitants of New York and Philadelphia sent the ships back to\r\nLondon, 'and they sailed up the Thames to proclaim to all the nation\r\nthat New York and Pennsylvania would not be enslaved.' The inhabitants\r\nof Charleston unloaded the tea and stored it in cellars, where it could\r\nnot be used, and where it finally perished.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of Boston tried every measure to send back the three\r\ntea ships which had arrived there, but without success. The captains of\r\nthe ships had consented, if permitted, to return with their cargoes to\r\nEngland; but the consignees refused to discharge them from their\r\nobligations, the Custom-house to give them a clearance for their return,\r\nand the Governor refused to grant them a passport for clearing the fort.\r\nIt was easily seen that the tea would be gradually landed from the ships\r\nlying so near the town, and that if landed it would be disposed of, and\r\nthe purpose of establishing the monopoly and raising a revenue effected.\r\nTo prevent this dreaded consequence, a number of armed men, disguised\r\nlike Indians, boarded the ships and threw their whole cargoes of tea\r\ninto the dock.\"[320]\r\n\r\nA more circumstantial and graphic account of this affair is given by Mr.\r\nJ.S. Barry, in his History of Massachusetts, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, November 28, 1773, one of the ships arrived, bringing one\r\nhundred and fourteen chests of tea. Immediately the Select Men held a\r\nmeeting; and the Committee of Correspondence obtained from Rotch, the\r\nowner of the vessel, a promise not to enter it until Tuesday. The towns\r\naround Boston were summoned to meet on Monday; 'and every friend to his\r\ncountry, to himself, and to posterity,' was desired to attend, 'to make\r\na united and successful resistance to this last, worst, and most\r\ndestructive measure of administration.'\r\n\r\n\"At an early hour (Monday, November 29) the people gathered, and by nine\r\no'clock the concourse was so great that Faneuil Hall was filled to\r\noverflowing. A motion to adjourn to the Old South Meeting-house, the\r\n'Sanctuary of Freedom,' was made and carried; and on reaching that\r\nplace, Jonathan Williams was chosen Moderator, and Hancock, Adams,\r\nYoung, Molineux, and Warren, fearlessly conducted the business of the\r\nmeeting. At least five thousand persons were in and around the building,\r\nand but one spirit animated all. Samuel Adams offered a resolution,\r\nwhich was unanimously adopted, 'That the tea should be sent back to the\r\nplace from whence it came, at all events, and that no duty should be\r\npaid on it.' The consignees asked time for consideration, and 'out of\r\ngreat tenderness' their request was granted. To prevent any surprise,\r\nhowever, a watch of twenty-five persons, under Edward Proctor, was\r\nappointed to guard the ship during the night.\r\n\r\n\"The answer of the consignees was given in the morning (November 30);\r\nand after declaring that it was out of their power to send back the\r\nteas, they expressed their readiness to store them until otherwise\r\nadvised. In the midst of the meeting the Sheriff of Suffolk entered,\r\nwith a proclamation from the Governor, warning the people to disperse;\r\nbut the message was received with derision and hisses, and a unanimous\r\nvote not to disperse. The master and owner of the ship which had lately\r\narrived were then required to attend; and a promise was extorted from\r\nthem that the teas should be returned without landing or paying a duty.\r\nThe factors of two other vessels which were daily expected were next\r\nsummoned, and similar promises were given by them; upon which the\r\nmeeting, after voting to carry into effect, 'at the risk of their lives\r\nand properties,' their former resolves, quietly dissolved.\r\n\r\n\"After this dissolution, the Committee of Correspondence of Boston and\r\nits vicinity held meetings daily, and gave such directions as\r\ncircumstances required. The other ships, on their arrival, anchored\r\nbeside the _Dartmouth_ (Rotch's vessel), that one guard might serve for\r\nall; and the inhabitants of a number of towns, at meetings convened for\r\nthe purpose, promised to aid Boston whenever their services should be\r\nneeded. At the end of twenty days the question must be decided, and if\r\nthe teas were landed all was lost. As the crisis drew near the\r\nexcitement increased. Hutchinson was confident that no violent measures\r\nwould be taken. The wealth of Hancock and others seemed sufficient\r\nsecurity against such measures. But the people had counted the cost,\r\nand had determined to risk all rather than be slaves.\r\n\r\n\"The eventful day (December 16) at last dawned; and two thousand from\r\nthe country, besides the citizens of Boston, assembled in the Old South\r\nMeeting-house at ten o'clock, to decide what should be done. It was\r\nreported that Rotch, the owner of the _Dartmouth_, had been refused a\r\nclearance; and he was immediately instructed to 'protest against the\r\nCustom-house, and apply to the Governor for his pass.' But the Governor\r\nhad stolen to his residence at Milton, and at three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon Rotch had not returned. What should be done? 'Shall we abide\r\nby our resolutions?' it was asked. Adams and Young were in favour of\r\nthat course; Quincy, distinguished as a statesman and patriot, advised\r\ndiscretion; but the people cried, 'Our hands have been put to the\r\nplough; we must not look back;' and the whole assemblage of seven\r\nthousand persons voted unanimously that the tea should not be landed.\r\n\r\n\"Darkness in the meantime had settled upon the town, and in the\r\ndimly-lighted church the audience awaited the return of Rotch. At a\r\nquarter before six he made his appearance, and reported that the\r\nGovernor had refused him his pass. 'We can do no more to save the\r\ncountry,' said Samuel Adams; and a momentary silence ensued. The next\r\ninstant a shout was heard at the door; the war-whoop sounded; and forty\r\nor fifty men, disguised as Indians, hurried along to Griffin's Wharf,\r\nposted guards to prevent intrusion, boarded the ships, and in three\r\nhours' time had broken and emptied into the sea three hundred and\r\nforty-two chests of tea. So great was the stillness, that the blows of\r\nthe hatchets as the chests were split open were distinctly heard. When\r\nthe deed was done, every one retired, and the town was as quiet as if\r\nnothing had occurred.\"[321]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing threefold narrative presents substantially the American\r\ncase of destroying the East India Company's tea by the inhabitants of\r\nBoston. The account by Mr. Bancroft is more elaborate, digressive,\r\ndramatic, and declamatory, but not so consecutive or concise as the\r\npreceding. Governor Hutchinson, who had advised the very policy which\r\nnow recoiled upon himself, corroborates in all essential points the\r\nnarrative given above. He states, however, what is slightly intimated\r\nabove by Dr. Ramsay, that the opposition commenced by the merchants\r\nagainst the monopoly of the East India Company, rather than against the\r\ntax itself, which had been paid without murmuring for two years, and\r\nthat the parliamentary tax on tea was seized upon, at the suggestion of\r\nmerchants in England, to defeat the monopoly of the East India Company,\r\nand to revive and perpetuate the excitement against the British\r\nParliament which had been created by the Stamp Act, and which was\r\nrapidly subsiding. Governor Hutchinson says:\r\n\r\n\"When the intelligence first came to Boston it caused no alarm. The\r\nthreepenny duty had been paid the last two years without any stir, and\r\nsome of the great friends to liberty had been importers of tea. The body\r\nof the people were pleased with the prospect of drinking tea at less\r\nexpense than ever. The only apparent discontent was among the importers\r\nof tea, as well those who had been legal importers from England, as\r\nothers who had illegally imported from Holland; and the complaint was\r\nagainst the East India Company for monopolizing a branch of commerce\r\nwhich had been beneficial to a great number of individual merchants. And\r\nthe first suggestion of a design in the Ministry to enlarge the revenue,\r\nand to habituate the colonies to parliamentary taxes, was made from\r\nEngland; and opposition to the measure was recommended, with an\r\nintimation that it was expected that the tea would not be suffered to be\r\nlanded.\"[322]\r\n\r\nThe Committees of Correspondence in the several colonies soon availed\r\nthemselves of so favourable an opportunity for promoting their great\r\npurpose. It soon appeared to be their general determination, that at\r\nall events the tea should be sent back to England in the same ships\r\nwhich brought it. The first motions were at Philadelphia (Oct. 18th),\r\nwhere, at a meeting of the people, every man who should be concerned in\r\nunlading, receiving, or vending the tea, was pronounced an enemy to his\r\ncountry. This was one of the eight resolves passed at the meeting. The\r\nexample was followed by Boston, November 3rd.[323]\r\n\r\nThen follows Governor Hutchinson's account of the meetings and\r\ngatherings in Boston: the messages and answers between their Committees\r\nand the consignees, Custom-house officers, and the ultimate throwing of\r\nthe tea into the dock, substantially as narrated in the preceding pages,\r\ntogether with his consultations with his Council, and his remarks upon\r\nthe motives and conduct of the parties opposed to him. He admits that\r\nhis Council was opposed to the measures which he proposed to suppress\r\nthe meetings of the people; he admits the universal hostility of the\r\npeople of Boston and of the neighbouring towns to the landing of the\r\ntea; that \"while the Governor and Council were sitting on the Monday, in\r\nthe Council Chamber, and known to be consulting upon means for\r\npreserving the peace of the town, several thousands of inhabitants of\r\nBoston and other towns were assembled in a public meeting-house at a\r\nsmall distance, in direct opposition and defiance.\" He says he \"sent the\r\nSheriff with a proclamation, to be read in the meeting, bearing\r\ntestimony against it as an unlawful assembly, and requiring the\r\nModerator and the people present forthwith to separate at their peril.\r\nBeing read, a general hiss followed, and then a question whether they\r\nwould surcease further proceedings, as the Governor required, which was\r\ndetermined in the negative, _nemine contradicente_.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be asked upon what legal or even reasonable ground had Governor\r\nHutchinson the right to denounce a popular meeting which happened at the\r\nsame time that he was holding a council, or because such meeting might\r\nentertain and express views differing from or in defiance of those\r\nwhich he was proposing to his Council?\r\n\r\nOr, what authority had Governor Hutchinson to issue a proclamation and\r\nsend a Sheriff to forbid a public meeting which the Charter and laws\r\nauthorized to be called and held, as much as the Governor was authorized\r\nto call and hold his Council, or as any town or township council or\r\nmeeting may be called and held in any province of the Dominion of\r\nCanada? It is not surprising that a public meeting \"hissed\" a command\r\nwhich was as lawless as it was powerless. The King himself would not\r\nhave ventured to do what Governor Hutchinson did, in like circumstances;\r\nand British subjects in Massachusetts had equal civil rights with\r\nBritish subjects in England.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hutchinson admits that the public meeting was not only\r\nnumerous, but composed of all classes of inhabitants, and was held in\r\nlegal form; and his objection to the legality of the meeting merely\r\nbecause persons from other towns were allowed to be present, while he\r\nconfesses that the inhabitants of Boston at the meeting were unanimous\r\nin their votes, is the most trivial that can be conceived. He says:\r\n\r\n\"A more determined spirit was conspicuous in this body than in any\r\nformer assemblies of the people. It was composed of the lowest, as well,\r\nand probably in as great proportion, as of the superior ranks and\r\norders, and all had an equal voice. No eccentric or irregular motions,\r\nhowever, were suffered to take place--all seemed to have been the plan\r\nof but a few--it may be, of a single person. The 'form' of town meeting\r\nwas assumed, the Select Men of Boston, town clerks, etc., taking their\r\nusual places; but the inhabitants of any other town being admitted, it\r\ncould not assume the name of a 'legal meeting of any town.'\" (A trivial\r\ntechnical objection.)\r\n\r\nReferring to another meeting--the last held before the day on which the\r\ntea was thrown into the sea--Governor Hutchinson states:\r\n\r\n\"The people came into Boston from the adjacent towns within twenty\r\nmiles, from some more, from others less, as they were affected; and, as\r\nsoon as they were assembled (November 14th, 1773), enjoined the owner of\r\nthe ship, at his peril, to demand of the Collector of Customs a\r\nclearance for the ship, and appointed ten of their number a committee to\r\naccompany him, and adjourned for two days to receive the report. Being\r\nreassembled (at the end of the two days), and informed by the owner that\r\na clearance was refused, he was enjoined immediately to apply to the\r\nGovernor for a pass by the Castle. He made an apology to the Governor\r\nfor coming upon such an errand, having been compelled to it, and\r\nreceived an answer that no pass ever had been, or lawfully could be,\r\ngiven to any vessel which had not first been cleared at the\r\nCustom-house, and that upon his producing a clearance, such pass would\r\nimmediately be given by the naval officer.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hutchinson knew that the Custom-house could not give the\r\nclearance without the landing of the tea and payment of the duty\r\nprovided for; he knew that the Custom-house had been applied to in vain\r\nto obtain a clearance. His reference of the owner to the Custom-house\r\nwas a mere evasion and pretext to gain time and prevent any decisive\r\naction on the part of the town meeting until the night of the 16th, when\r\nthe 20 days after the entry of the ships would have expired, and the\r\nCollector could seize the cargoes for non-payment of duties, place it in\r\ncharge of the Admiral at the Castle, and sell it under pretence of\r\npaying the duties. He says: \"The body of the people remained in the\r\nmeeting-house until they had received the Governor's answer; and then,\r\nafter it had been observed to them that, everything else in their power\r\nhaving been done, it now remained to proceed in the only way left, and\r\nthat the owner of the ship having behaved like a man of honour, no\r\ninjury ought to be offered to his person or property, the meeting was\r\ndeclared to be dissolved, and the body of the people repaired to the\r\nwharf and surrounded the immediate actors (who were 'covered with\r\nblankets, and making the appearance of Indians') as a guard and security\r\nuntil they had finished their work. In two or three hours they hoisted\r\nout of the holds of the ships three hundred and forty-two chests of tea,\r\nand emptied them into the sea. The Governor was unjustly censured by\r\nmany people in the province, and much abused by the pamphlet and\r\nnewspaper writers in England, for refusing his pass, which it is said\r\nwould have saved the property thus destroyed; but he would have been\r\njustly censured if he had granted it. He was bound, as all the Governors\r\nwere, by oath, faithfully to observe the Acts of Trade, and to do his\r\nendeavour that the statute of King William, which established a\r\nCustom-house, and is particularly mentioned in the Act, be carried into\r\nexecution.\"\r\n\r\nIn Governor Hutchinson's own statement and vindication of his conduct,\r\nhe admits that the meetings of the people were lawfully called and\r\nregularly conducted; that they were attended by the higher as well as\r\nlower classes of the people; that they exhausted every means in their\r\npower, deliberately and during successive days, to have the tea returned\r\nto England without damage, as was done from the ports of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia; and that by his own acts, different from those of New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, whose Governors were subject to\r\nthe same oaths as himself, the opposers of taxation by the British\r\nParliament were reduced to the alternative of defeat, or of throwing the\r\ntea in question into the sea, as the Governor had effectually blocked up\r\nevery possible way to their having the tea returned to England. Governor\r\nHutchinson does not pretend to the technical scrupulousness of his oath,\r\napplicable to ordinary cases, binding him to write to the Admiral to\r\nguard the tea by an increased number of armed vessels in the channel of\r\nthe harbour, and to prevent any vessel from passing out of the harbour\r\nfor sea, without his own permit; nor does he intimate that he himself\r\nwas the principal partner in the firm, nominally in the name of his\r\nsons, to whom the East India Company had principally consigned as agents\r\nthe sale of the tea in question; much less does he say that in his\r\nletters to England, which had been mysteriously obtained by Dr.\r\nFranklin, and of the publication of which he so strongly and justly\r\ncomplained, he had urged the virtual deprivation of his country of its\r\nconstitution of free government by having the Executive Councillors\r\nappointed and the salaries of the governor, judges, secretary, and\r\nattorney and solicitor-generals paid by the Crown out of the taxes of\r\nthe people of the colony, imposed by the Imperial Parliament. Governor\r\nHutchinson had rendered great service to his country by his History, and\r\nas a public representative, for many years in its Legislature and\r\nCouncils, and was long regarded as its chief leader; but he had at\r\nlength yielded to the seductions of ambition and avarice, and became an\r\nobject of popular hatred instead of being, as he had many years been, a\r\npopular idol. He had sown the seed of which he was now reaping the\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, under such circumstances, Governor\r\nHutchinson's health should become impaired and his spirits depressed,\r\nand that he should seek relief from his burdens and vexations by a visit\r\nto England, for which he applied and obtained permission, and which\r\nproved to be the end of his government of Massachusetts; for General\r\nGage was appointed to succeed him as Governor, as well as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the King's forces in America.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the last few months of Mr. Hutchinson's government of\r\nMassachusetts, it is obvious that his ill-advised policy and mode of\r\nproceeding--arising, no doubt, in a great measure, from his personal and\r\nfamily interest in speculation in the new system of tea trade--was the\r\nprimary and chief cause of those proceedings in which Boston differed\r\nfrom New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston in preventing the landing of\r\nthe East India Company's tea. Had the authorities in the provinces of\r\nNew York and Pennsylvania acted in the same way as did the Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, it cannot be doubted that the same scenes would have been\r\nwitnessed at Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York as transpired at\r\nBoston. The eight resolutions which were adopted by the inhabitants of\r\nPhiladelphia, in a public town meeting, on the 8th of October, as the\r\nbasis of their proceedings against the taxation of the colonies by the\r\nImperial Parliament, and against the landing of the East India Company's\r\ntea, were adopted by the inhabitants of Boston in a public town meeting\r\nthe 3rd of November. The tea was as effectually prevented from being\r\nlanded at the ports of New York and Philadelphia as it was at the port\r\nof Boston, and was as completely destroyed in the damp cellars at\r\nCharleston as in the sea water at Boston.[324]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: The resolutions adopted by a meeting of the inhabitants\r\nof Philadelphia, on the 18th of October, 1773, afford a specimen of the\r\nspirit of all the colonies, and the model of resolutions adopted in\r\nseveral of them, even Boston. They were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. That the disposal of their own property is the inherent right of\r\nfreemen; that there can be no property in that which another can, of\r\nright, take from us without our consent; that the claim of Parliament to\r\ntax America is, in other words, a claim of right to levy contributions\r\non us at pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the duty imposed by Parliament upon tea landed in America is a\r\ntax on the Americans, or levying contributions on them without their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the express purpose for which the tax is levied on the\r\nAmericans, namely, for the support of government, administration of\r\njustice, and defence of his Majesty's dominions in America, has a direct\r\ntendency to render Assemblies useless, and to introduce arbitrary\r\ngovernment and slavery.\r\n\r\n\"4. That a virtuous and steady opposition to this Ministerial plan of\r\ngoverning America is absolutely necessary to preserve even the shadow of\r\nliberty, and is a duty which every freeman in America owes to his\r\ncountry, to himself, and to his posterity.\r\n\r\n\"5. That the resolution lately entered into by the East India Company,\r\nto send out their tea to America, subject to the payment of duties on\r\nits being landed here, is an open attempt to enforce this Ministerial\r\nplan, and a violent attack upon the liberties of America.\r\n\r\n\"6. That it is the duty of every American to oppose this attempt.\r\n\r\n\"7. That whosoever shall, directly or indirectly, countenance this\r\nattempt, or in anywise aid or abet in unloading, receiving, or vending\r\nthe tea sent or to be sent out by the East India Company, while it\r\nremains subject to the payment of a duty here, is an enemy to his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"8. That a Committee be immediately chosen to wait on those gentlemen\r\nwho it is reported are appointed by the East India Company to receive\r\nand sell said tea, and request them, from a regard to their own\r\ncharacter, and the peace and good order of the city and province,\r\nimmediately to resign their appointments.\" (Ramsay's Colonial History,\r\nVol. I., pp. 372, 373.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: Ramsay's Colonial History, Vol. 1., Chap. iii., pp.\r\n373-375.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: Holmes' Annals, etc., Vol. II., pp. 181, 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: Barry's History of Massachusetts, Second Period, Chap.\r\nxiv., pp. 470-473.\r\n\r\nThe historian adds: \"The Governor was in a forlorn state, and was unable\r\nto keep up even a show of authority. Every one was against him. The\r\nHouses were against him. 'The superior judges were intimidated from\r\nacting,' and 'there was not a justice of the peace, sheriff, constable,\r\nor peace-officer in the province who would venture to take cognizance of\r\nany breach of law against the general bent of the people.'\"--_Ib._, 473,\r\n474.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: Governor Hutchinson, in a note, referring to the\r\nmercantile English letters which contained the suggestion not to allow\r\nthe landing of the tea of the East India Company, says:\r\n\r\n\"These letters were dated in England the beginning of August, and were\r\nreceived in America the latter end of September and the beginning of\r\nOctober.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft states as follows the causes and circumstances of this\r\ndisastrous tea agreement between the British Ministry and East India\r\nCompany:\r\n\r\n\"The continued refusal of North America to receive tea from England had\r\nbrought distress upon the East India Company, which had on hand, wanting\r\na market, great quantities imported in the faith that that agreement (in\r\nthe colonies, not to purchase tea imported from England) could not hold.\r\nThey were able to pay neither their dividends nor their debts; their\r\nstock depreciated nearly one-half; and the Government must lose their\r\nannual payment of four hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\"The bankruptcies, brought on partly by this means, gave such a shock to\r\ncredit as had not been experienced since the South Sea year, and the\r\ngreat manufacturers were sufferers. The directors came to Parliament\r\nwith an ample confession of their humbled state, together with\r\nentreaties for assistance and relief, and particularly praying that\r\nleave might be given to export tea free of all duties to America and to\r\nforeign ports. Had such leave been granted in respect of America, it\r\nwould have been an excellent commercial regulation, as well as have\r\nrestored a good understanding to every part of the empire. Instead of\r\nthis, Lord North proposed to give to the Company itself the right of\r\nexporting its teas. The existing law granted on their exportation to\r\nAmerica a drawback of three-fifths only of the duties paid on\r\nimportation. Lord North now offered to the East India Company a drawback\r\nof the whole. Trecothick, in the committee, also advised to take off the\r\nimport duty in America of threepence the pound, as it produced no income\r\nto the revenue; but the Ministry would not listen to the thought of\r\nrelieving America from taxation. 'Then,' added Trecothick in behalf of\r\nthe East India Company, 'as much or more may be brought into revenue by\r\nnot allowing a full exemption from the duties paid here.' But Lord North\r\nrefused to discuss the right of Parliament to tax America, insisting\r\nthat no difficulty could arise; that under the new regulation America\r\nwould be able to buy tea from the Company at a lower price than from any\r\nother European nation, and that men will always go to the cheapest\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\"The Ministry was still in its halcyon days; no opposition was made even\r\nby the Whigs; and the measure, which was the King's own, and was\r\ndesigned to put America to the test, took effect as law from the 10th\r\nday of May, 1773. It was immediately followed by a most carefully\r\nprepared answer from the King to petitions from Massachusetts,\r\nannouncing that he 'considered his authority to make laws in Parliament\r\nof sufficient force and validity to bind his subjects in America, in all\r\ncases whatsoever, as essential to the dignity of the Crown, and a right\r\nappertaining to the State, which it was his duty to preserve entire and\r\ninviolate;' that he therefore 'could not but be greatly displeased with\r\nthe petitions and remonstrance in which that right was drawn into\r\nquestion,' but that he 'imputed the unwarrantable doctrines held forth\r\nin the said petitions and remonstrance to the artifices of a few.' All\r\nthis while Lord Dartmouth (the new Secretary of State for the Colonies,\r\nsuccessor to Lord Hillsborough) 'had a true desire to see lenient\r\nmeasures adopted towards the colonies,' not being in the least aware\r\nthat he was drifting with the Cabinet towards the very system of\r\ncoercion against which he gave the most public and the most explicit\r\npledges.\" (History of the United States, Vol. VI., pp. 458-460.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: See these resolutions, in a note on pp. 374, 375.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: \"In South Carolina, some of the tea was thrown into the\r\nriver as at Boston.\" (English Annual Register for 1774, Vol. XVII., p.\r\n50.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF 1774--ALL CLASSES IN THE COLONIES DISCONTENTED--ALL CLASSES\r\nAND ALL THE PROVINCES REJECT THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S TEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1774 commenced, among other legacies of 1773, with that of the\r\ndiscontent of all the colonies,[325] their unanimous rejection of the\r\nEast India tea, stamped with the threepenny duty of parliamentary tax,\r\nas the symbol of the absolutism of King and Parliament over the\r\ncolonies. The manner of its rejection, by being thrown into the sea at\r\nBoston, was universally denounced by all parties in England. The\r\naccounts of all the proceedings in America against the admission of the\r\nEast India tea to the colonial ports, were coloured by the mediums\r\nthrough which they were transmitted--the royal governors and their\r\nexecutive officers, who expected large advantages from being assigned\r\nand paid their salaries by the Crown, independent of the local\r\nLegislatures; and the consignees of the East India Company, who\r\nanticipated large profits from their monopoly of its sale. Opposition to\r\nthe tea duty was represented as \"rebellion\"--the assertors of colonial\r\nfreedom from imperial taxation without representation were designated\r\n\"rebels\" and \"traitors,\" notwithstanding their professed loyalty to the\r\nThrone and to the unity of the empire, and that their utmost wishes were\r\nlimited to be replaced in the position they occupied after the peace of\r\nParis, in 1763, and after their unanimous and admitted loyalty, and even\r\nheroism, in defence and support of British supremacy in America.\r\n\r\n\"Intelligence,\" says Dr. Holmes, \"of the destruction of the tea at\r\nBoston was communicated on the 7th of March (1774), in a message from\r\nthe Throne, to both Houses of Parliament. In this communication the\r\nconduct of the colonists was represented as not merely obstructing the\r\ncommerce of Great Britain, but as subversive of the British\r\nConstitution. Although the papers accompanying the Royal message\r\nrendered it evident that the opposition to the sale of the tea was\r\ncommon to all the colonies; yet the Parliament, enraged at the violence\r\nof Boston, selected that town as the object of its legislative\r\nvengeance. Without giving the opportunity of a hearing, a Bill was\r\npassed by which the port of Boston was legally precluded from the\r\nprivilege of landing and discharging, or of lading or shipping goods,\r\nwares, and merchandise; and every vessel within the points Aldeston and\r\nNahant was required to depart within six hours, unless laden with food\r\nor fuel.\r\n\r\n\"This Act, which shut up the harbour of Boston, was speedily followed by\r\nanother, entitled 'An Act for Better Regulating the Government of\r\nMassachusetts,' which provided that the Council, heretofore elected by\r\nthe General Assembly, was to be appointed by the Crown; the Royal\r\nGovernor was invested with the power of appointing and removing all\r\nJudges of the Courts of Common Pleas, Commissioners of Oyer and\r\nTerminer, the Attorney-General, Provost-Marshal, Justices, Sheriffs,\r\netc.; town meetings, which were sanctioned by the Charter, were, with\r\nfew exceptions, expressly forbidden, without leave previously obtained\r\nof the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor, expressing the special business\r\nof said meeting, and with a further restriction that no matters should\r\nbe treated of at these meetings except the electing of public officers\r\nand the business expressed in the Governor's permission; jurymen, who\r\nhad been elected before by the freeholders and inhabitants of the\r\nseveral towns, were to be all summoned and returned by the sheriffs of\r\nthe respective counties; the whole executive government was taken out\r\nof the hands of the people, and the nomination of all important officers\r\ninvested in the King or his Governor.\r\n\r\n\"In the apprehension that in the execution of these Acts riots would\r\ntake place, and that trials or murders committed in suppressing them\r\nwould be partially decided by the colonists, it was provided by another\r\nAct, that if any persons were indicted for murder, or any capital\r\noffence, _committed in aiding the magistracy_, the Governor might send\r\nthe person so indicted to another county, or to Great Britain, to be\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n\"These three Acts were passed in such quick succession as to produce the\r\nmost inflammatory effects in America, where they were considered as\r\nforming a complete system of tyranny. 'By the first,' said the\r\ncolonists, 'the property of unoffending thousands is arbitrarily taken\r\naway for the act of a few individuals; by the second, our chartered\r\nliberties are annihilated; and by the third, our lives may be destroyed\r\nwith impunity.'\"[326]\r\n\r\nThe passing of these three Bills through Parliament was attended in each\r\ncase with protracted and animated debates.\r\n\r\nThe first debate or discussion of American affairs took place on the 7th\r\nof March, in proposing an address of thanks to the King for the message\r\nand the communication of the American papers, with an assurance that the\r\nHouse would not fail to exert every means in their power of effectually\r\nproviding for objects so important to the general welfare as maintaining\r\nthe due execution of the laws, and for securing the just dependence of\r\nthe colonies upon the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn moving this address to pledge Parliament to the exertion of every\r\nmeans in its power, Mr. Rice said: \"The question now brought to issue\r\nis, whether the colonies are or are not the colonies of Great Britain.\"\r\nLord North said, \"Nothing can be done to re-establish peace, without\r\nadditional powers from Parliament.\" Nugent, now Lord Clare (who had\r\nadvocated the Stamp Act, if the revenue from it should not exceed a\r\npeppercorn, as a symbol of parliamentary power), entreated that there\r\nmight be no divided counsels. Dowdeswill said: \"On the repeal of the\r\nStamp Act, all America was quiet; but in the following year you would go\r\nin pursuit of your peppercorn--you would collect from peppercorn to\r\npeppercorn--you would establish taxes as tests of obedience. Unravel the\r\nwhole conduct of America; you will find out the fault is at home.\"\r\nPownall, former Governor of Massachusetts and earnest advocate of\r\nAmerican rights, said: \"The dependence of the colonies is a part of the\r\nBritish Constitution. I hope, for the sake of this country, for the sake\r\nof America, for the sake of general liberty, that this address will pass\r\nwith a unanimous vote.\" Colonel Barré even applauded the good temper\r\nwith which the subject had been discussed, and refused to make any\r\nopposition. William Burke, brother of Edmund Burke, said: \"I speak as an\r\nEnglishman. We applaud ourselves for the struggles we have had for our\r\nconstitution; the colonists are our fellow-subjects; they will not lose\r\ntheirs without a struggle.\" Wedderburn, the Solicitor-General, who bore\r\nthe principal part in the debate, said: \"The leading question is the\r\ndependence or independence of America.\" The address was adopted without\r\na division.[327]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of March, Lord North explained at large his American policy,\r\nand opened the first part of his plan by asking leave to bring in a Bill\r\nfor the instant punishment of Boston. He stated, says the Annual\r\nRegister, \"that the opposition to the authority of Parliament had always\r\noriginated in the colony of Massachusetts, and that colony had been\r\nalways instigated to such conduct by the irregular and seditious\r\nproceedings of the town of Boston; that, therefore, for the purpose of\r\na thorough reformation, it became necessary to begin with that town,\r\nwhich by a late unpardonable outrage had led the way to the destruction\r\nof the freedom of commerce in all parts of America: that if a severe and\r\nexemplary punishment were not inflicted on this heinous act, Great\r\nBritain would be wanting in the protection she owed to her most\r\npeaceable and meritorious subjects: that had such an insult been offered\r\nto British property in a foreign port, the nation would have been called\r\nupon to demand satisfaction for it.\r\n\r\n\"He would therefore propose that the town of Boston should be obliged to\r\npay for the tea which had been destroyed in their port: that the injury\r\nwas indeed offered by persons unknown and in disguise, but that the town\r\nmagistracy had taken no notice of it, had never made any search for the\r\noffenders, and therefore, by a neglect of manifest duty, became\r\naccomplices in the guilt: that the fining of communities for their\r\nneglect in punishing offences committed within their limits was\r\njustified by several examples. In King Charles the Second's time, the\r\ncity of London was fined when Dr. Lamb was killed by unknown persons.\r\nThe city of Edinburgh was fined and otherwise punished for the affair of\r\nCaptain Porteous. A part of the revenue of the town of Glasgow had been\r\nsequestered until satisfaction was made for the pulling down of Mr.\r\nCampbell's house. These examples were strong in point for such\r\npunishments. The case of Boston was far worse. It was not a single act\r\nof violence; it was a series of seditious practices of every kind, and\r\ncarried on for several years.\r\n\r\n\"He was of opinion, therefore, that it would not be sufficient to punish\r\nthe town of Boston by obliging her to make a pecuniary satisfaction for\r\nthe injury which, by not endeavouring to prevent or punish, she has, in\r\nfact, encouraged; security must be given in future that trade may be\r\nsafely carried on, property protected, laws obeyed, and duties regularly\r\npaid. Otherwise the punishment of a single illegal act is no\r\nreformation. It would be therefore proper to take away from Boston the\r\nprivilege of a port until his Majesty should be satisfied in these\r\nparticulars, and publicly declare in Council, on a proper certificate of\r\nthe good behaviour of the town, that he was so satisfied. Until this\r\nshould happen, the Custom-house officers, who were now not safe in\r\nBoston, or safe no longer than while they neglected their duty, should\r\nbe removed to Salem, where they might exercise their functions.\"[328]\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed the first reading without discussion. At the second\r\nreading, Mr. Byng alone voted no, though there was considerable\r\ndiscussion. \"Mr. Bollan, the agent for the Council of Massachusetts Bay,\r\npresented a petition, desiring to be heard in behalf of said Council and\r\nother inhabitants of Boston; but the House refused to receive the\r\npetition.\"[329]\r\n\r\nAt the third reading, the Lord Mayor of London presented a petition in\r\nbehalf of several natives and inhabitants of North America then in\r\nLondon. \"It was drawn,\" says the Annual Register, \"with remarkable\r\nability.\" The petitioners alleged that \"the proceedings were repugnant\r\nto every principle of law and justice, and under such a precedent no\r\nman in America could enjoy a moment's security; for if judgment be\r\nimmediately to follow on accusation against the people of America,\r\nsupported by persons notoriously at enmity with them, the accused\r\nunacquainted with the charges, and from the nature of their situation\r\nutterly incapable of answering and defending themselves, every fence\r\nagainst false accusation will be pulled down.\r\n\r\n\"They asserted that law is executed with as much impartiality in America\r\nas in any part of his Majesty's dominions. They appealed for proof of\r\nthis to the fair trial and favourable verdict in the case of Captain\r\nPreston and his soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"That in such a case the interposition of parliamentary power was full\r\nof danger and without precedent. The persons committing the injury were\r\nunknown. If discovered, the law ought first to be tried. If unknown,\r\nwhat rule of justice can punish the town for a civil injury committed by\r\npersons not known to them?\r\n\r\n\"That the instances of the cities of London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow were\r\nwholly dissimilar. All these towns were regularly heard in their own\r\ndefence. Their magistrates were of their own choosing (which was not the\r\ncase of Boston), and therefore they were more equitably responsible. But\r\nin Boston the King's Governor has the power, and had been advised by his\r\nCouncil to exert it; if it has been neglected, he alone is\r\nanswerable.\"[330] In conclusion, the petitioners strongly insisted on\r\nthe injustice of the Act, and its tendency to alienate the affections of\r\nAmerica from the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe petition was received, but no particular proceedings took place upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed the House on the 25th of March, and was carried up to\r\nthe Lords, where it was likewise warmly debated; but, as in the Commons,\r\nwithout a division. It received the Royal assent on the 31st of\r\nMarch.[331]\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsay remarks: \"By the operation of the Boston Port Act, the\r\npreceding situation of its inhabitants and that of the East India\r\nCompany was reversed. The former had more reason to complain of the\r\ndisproportionate penalty to which they were indiscriminately subjected,\r\nthan the latter of that outrage on their property, for which punishment\r\nhad been inflicted. Hitherto the East India Company were the injured\r\nparty; but from the passing of this Act the balance of injury was on the\r\nopposite side. If wrongs received entitled the former to reparation, the\r\nlatter had a much stronger title on the same ground. For the act of\r\nseventeen or eighteen individuals, as many thousands were involved in\r\none general calamity.\"[332]\r\n\r\nShortly after the passing of the Boston Port Bill, the second Bill was\r\nbrought into Parliament, entitled \"An Act for the Better Regulating of\r\nthe Government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.\" This Bill was\r\nbrought in on the 28th of March, three days before the Royal assent was\r\ngiven to the Boston Port Bill. As the town of Boston had received no\r\nnotice of the Bill which closed its port, and had therefore no\r\nopportunity to vindicate its conduct or rights; so the Province received\r\nno notice of the Bill which changed its system of government, which\r\nabrogated so much of its Charter as gave to its Legislative Assembly the\r\nchoice of the Council; abolished town meetings, except for the choice of\r\ntown officers, or on the special permission of the Governor, which gave\r\nto the Crown the appointment and removal of the sheriffs, and to the\r\nsheriffs the selection of the juries, which had hitherto been elected by\r\nthe people. After an animated debate, led by Dunning in opposition, the\r\nBill passed the Commons by a vote of more than three to one.\r\n\r\nThe third penal Bill brought in and passed was said to have been\r\nspecially recommended by the King himself. It authorized, at the\r\ndiscretion of the Governor, the removal for trial to Nova Scotia or\r\nGreat Britain of all magistrates, revenue officers, or soldiers indicted\r\nfor murder or other capital offence. Mr. Bancroft says: \"As Lord North\r\nbrought forward this wholesale Bill of indemnity to the Governor and\r\nsoldiers, if they should trample upon the people of Boston and be\r\ncharged with murder, it was noticed that he trembled and faltered at\r\nevery word; showing that he was the vassal of a stronger will than his\r\nown, and vainly struggled to wrestle down the feelings which his nature\r\nrefused to disavow.\"[333]\r\n\r\nColonel Barré, who had supported the Boston Port Bill, said: \"I execrate\r\nthe present measure; you have had one meeting of the colonies in\r\nCongress. You may soon have another. The Americans will not abandon\r\ntheir principles; for if they submit they are slaves.\" The Bill passed\r\nthe Commons by a vote of more than four to one.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Bill legalized the quartering of troops within the town of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, What were the effects of these measures upon\r\nthe colonies? We answer, the effects of these measures were the very\r\nreverse of what had been anticipated and predicted by their advocates in\r\nEngland, both in and out of Parliament. The general expectation in\r\nEngland was that they would not be resisted in America; that Boston and\r\nMassachusetts would submit; that if they should not submit, they would\r\nbe isolated from the other provinces, who would not identify themselves\r\nwith or countenance the extreme proceedings of Boston and of\r\nMassachusetts. These measures had been adopted by the Government and\r\nParliament of Great Britain in the months of March and April, and were\r\nto take effect the 1st of June. In the two following months of May and\r\nJune, America spoke, and twelve colonies out of thirteen (Georgia alone\r\nexcepted) protested against the measures of the British Parliament, and\r\nexpressed their sympathy with Boston and Massachusetts. Boston itself\r\nspoke first, and instead of submitting, as had been predicted by Lords\r\nMansfield and others, held a town meeting as soon as they received\r\nintelligence of the passing of the Boston Port Bill, at which\r\nresolutions were passed expressing their opinion of the impolicy,\r\ninjustice, inhumanity and cruelty of this Act, from which they appealed\r\nto God and to the world; also inviting other colonies to join with them\r\nin an agreement to stop all imports and exports to and from Great\r\nBritain and Ireland and the West Indies until the Act should be\r\nrepealed.[334]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft, remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The merchants of Newburyport were the first who agreed to suspend all\r\ncommerce with Britain and Ireland. Salem, also, the place marked out as\r\nthe new seat of government, in a very full town meeting, and after\r\nunimpassioned debates, decided almost unanimously to stop trade, not\r\nwith Britain only, but even with the West Indies. If in Boston a few\r\ncravens proposed to purchase a relaxation of the blockade by quailing\r\nbefore power, the majority were beset by no temptation so strong as that\r\nof routing at once the insignificant number of troops who had come to\r\noverawe them. But Samuel Adams, while he compared their spirit to that\r\nof Sparta or Rome, was ever inculcating patience as the characteristic\r\nof a true patriot; and the people having sent forth their cry to the\r\ncontinent, waited self-possessed for voices of consolation.\"[335]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, according to the provisions of the Charter, the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts, the last Wednesday in May, proceeded to\r\nnominate the twenty-eight councillors. Of these, General Gage negatived\r\nthe unprecedented number of thirteen, including all the popular leaders\r\nnominated. He laid nothing before the General Assembly but the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the province; but gave notice that the seat of government\r\nwould be removed to Salem the 1st of June, in pursuance of the Act for\r\nClosing the Port of Boston.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature reassembled, according to adjournment, at Salem the 7th\r\nday of June,[336] after ten days' prorogation, and on the 9th the\r\nCouncil replied to the Governor's speech at the opening of the session.\r\nTheir answer was respectful, but firmly and loyally expressive of their\r\nviews and feelings. They declared their readiness \"on all occasions\r\ncheerfully to co-operate with his Excellency\" in every step tending to\r\n\"restore harmony\" and \"extricate the province from their present\r\nembarrassments,\" which, in their estimation, were attributable to the\r\nconduct of his \"two immediate predecessors.\" They at the same time\r\naffirmed that \"the inhabitants of the colony claimed no more than the\r\nrights of Englishmen, without diminution or abridgment;\" and that these,\r\n\"as it was their indispensable duty, so would it be their constant\r\nendeavour to maintain to the utmost of their power, in perfect\r\nconsistence with the truest loyalty to the Crown, the just prerogatives\r\nof which they should ever be zealous to support.\" To this address the\r\nGovernor replied in the following bitter words: \"I cannot receive this\r\naddress, which contains indecent reflections on my predecessors, who\r\nhave been tried and honourably acquitted by the Lords of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and their conduct approved by the King. I consider this address\r\nas an insult upon his Majesty and the Lords of the Privy Council, and an\r\naffront to myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of the Assembly was very courteous, but equally decided with\r\nthat of the Council. They congratulated his Excellency on his safe\r\narrival, and declared that they \"honoured him in the most exalted\r\nstation of the province, and confided in him to make the known\r\nConstitution and Charter the rule of his administration;\" they\r\n\"deprecated the removal of the Court to Salem,\" but expressed a hope\r\nthat \"the true state of the province, and the character of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects in it, their loyalty to their Sovereign and their affection for\r\nthe parent country,[337] as well as their invincible attachment to their\r\njust rights and liberties, would be laid before his Majesty, and that he\r\nwould be the happy instrument of removing his Majesty's displeasure, and\r\nrestoring harmony, which had been long interrupted by the artifices of\r\ninterested and designing men.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, after much private consultation among its\r\nleading members, proceeded with closed doors to the consideration and\r\nadoption, by a majority of 92 to 12, of resolutions declaring the\r\nnecessity of a general meeting of all the colonies in Congress, \"in\r\norder to consult together upon the present state of the colonies, and\r\nthe miseries to which they are and must be reduced by the operation of\r\ncertain Acts of Parliament respecting America; and to deliberate and\r\ndetermine upon wise and proper measures to be by them recommended to all\r\nthe colonies for the recovery and establishment of their just rights and\r\nliberties, civil and religious, and the restoration of union and harmony\r\nbetween Great Britain and the colonies, most ardently to be desired by\r\nall good men.\" They elected five gentlemen to represent Massachusetts\r\nto the proposed Congress.\r\n\r\nThe House also proceeded with all expedition to draw up a declaration of\r\ntheir sentiments, to be published as a rule for the conduct of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts. \"This declaration,\" says Dr. Andrews,\r\n\"contained a repetition of grievances; the necessity they were now under\r\nof struggling against lawless power; the disregard of their petitions,\r\nthough founded on the clearest and most equitable reasons; the evident\r\nintention of Great Britain to destroy the Constitution transmitted to\r\nthem from their ancestors, and to erect upon its ruins a system of\r\nabsolute sway, incompatible with their disposition and subversive of the\r\nrights they had uninterruptedly enjoyed during the space of more than a\r\ncentury and a half. Impelled by these motives, they thought it their\r\nduty to advise the inhabitants of Massachusetts to throw every\r\nobstruction in their power in the way of such evil designs, and\r\nrecommended as one of the most effectual, a total disuse of all\r\nimportations from Great Britain until an entire redress had been\r\nobtained of every grievance.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the secrecy with which this business was carried on,\"\r\ncontinues Dr. Andrews, \"the Governor was apprized of it; and on the very\r\nday it was completed, and the report of it made to the House (and\r\nadopted), he dissolved the Assembly, which was the last that was held in\r\nthat colony agreeably to the tenor of the Charter.\"[338]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: \"The discontents and disorders continue to prevail in a\r\ngreater or less degree through all the old colonies on the continent.\r\nThe same spirit pervades the whole.

He then partook of a\r\npublic dinner in Faneuil Hall. A hope still lingered that relief might\r\ncome through his intercession. But Gage was neither fit to reconcile nor\r\nto subdue. By his mild temper and love of society, he gained the\r\ngood-will of his boon companions, and escaped personal enmities; but in\r\nearnest business he inspired neither confidence nor fear. Though his\r\ndisposition was far from being malignant, he was so poor in spirit and\r\nso weak of will, so dull in his perceptions and so unsettled in his\r\nopinions, that he was sure to follow the worst advice, and vacillate\r\nbetween smooth words of concession and merciless severity.

The Governor, in\r\ngreat haste, sent the Secretary to dissolve the Court. Finding the door\r\nlocked, he knocked for admission, but was answered, that 'The House was\r\nupon very important business, which when they had finished, they would\r\nlet him in.' Failing to obtain an entrance, he stood upon the steps and\r\nread the proclamation in the hearing of several members and others, and\r\nafter reading it in the Council Chamber, returned. The House took no\r\nnotice of this message, but proceeded with their business; and, by a\r\nvote of 117 to 12, having determined that a Committee should be\r\nappointed to meet, as soon as may be, the Committees that are or shall\r\nbe appointed by the several colonies on this continent to consult\r\ntogether upon the present state of the colonies, James Bowdoin, Thomas\r\nCushing, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Robert Treat Paine were selected\r\nfor that purpose, and funds were provided for defraying their expenses.\"\r\n(Barry's History of Massachusetts, Second Period, Chap. xiv., pp. 484,\r\n485.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1774, UNTIL THE MEETING OF THE FIRST GENERAL CONGRESS IN SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe responses to the appeals of Boston and the proposals of the Assembly\r\nof Massachusetts, for a meeting of Congress of all the colonies, were\r\nprompt and general and sympathetic beyond what had been anticipated; and\r\nin some colonies the expressions of approval and offers of co-operation\r\nand assistance preceded any knowledge of what was doing, or had been\r\ndone, in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the House of Burgesses were in session when the news arrived\r\nfrom England announcing the passing by the British Parliament of the\r\nBoston Port Bill; and on the 26th of May the House resolved that the 1st\r\nof June, the day on which that Bill was to go into effect, should be set\r\napart by the members as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer,\r\n\"devoutly to implore the Divine interposition for averting the heavy\r\ncalamities which threatened destruction to their civil rights, and the\r\nevils of a civil war, and to give them one heart and one mind to oppose,\r\nby all just and proper means, every injury to American rights.\" On the\r\npublication of this resolution, the Governor (the Earl of Dunmore)\r\ndissolved the House. But the members, before separating, entered into an\r\nassociation and signed an agreement, to the number of 87, in which,\r\namong other things, they declared \"that an attack made on one of their\r\nsister colonies, to compel submission to arbitrary taxes, was an attack\r\nmade on all British America, and threatened ruin to the civil rights of\r\nall, unless the united wisdom of the whole be applied in prevention.\"\r\nThey therefore recommended to their Committee of Correspondence to\r\ncommunicate with the several Committees of the other provinces, on the\r\nexpediency of appointing deputies from the different colonies, to meet\r\nannually in Congress, and to deliberate on the common interests of\r\nAmerica. This measure had already been proposed in town meetings, both\r\nin New York and Boston. The colonies, from New Hampshire to South\r\nCarolina inclusive, adopted this measure; and where the Legislatures\r\nwere not in session, elections were made by the people.[339]\r\n\r\nWhile there was a general agreement of sentiment throughout the colonies\r\nin favour of a Congress or Convention of all the colonies to consult on\r\ncommon rights and interests, and to devise the best means of securing\r\nthem, there was also a corresponding sympathy and liberality for the\r\nrelief of the inhabitants of Boston, who were considered as suffering\r\nfor the maintenance of rights sacred to the liberties of all the\r\ncolonies, as all had resisted successfully the landing of the tea, the\r\nbadge of their enslavement, though all had not been driven by the\r\nGovernor, as in the case of Massachusetts, to destroy it in order to\r\nprevent its being landed. Yet even this had been done to some extent\r\nboth in South Carolina and New York.\r\n\r\nThe town of Boston became an object of interest, and its inhabitants\r\nsubjects of sympathy throughout the colonies of America. All the\r\nhistories of those times agree \"that as soon as the true character of\r\nthe Boston Port Act became known in America, every colony, every city,\r\nevery village, and, as it were, the inmates of every farm-house, felt\r\nit as a wound of their affections. The towns of Massachusetts abounded\r\nin kind offices. The colonies vied with each other in liberality. The\r\nrecord kept at Boston shows that 'the patriotic and generous people' of\r\nSouth Carolina were the first to minister to the sufferers, sending\r\nearly in June two hundred barrels of rice, and promising eight hundred\r\nmore. At Wilmington, North Carolina, the sum of two thousand pounds\r\ncurrency was raised in a few days; the women of the place gave\r\nliberally. Throughout all New England the towns sent rye, flour, peas,\r\ncattle, sheep, oil, fish; whatever the land or hook and line could\r\nfurnish, and sometimes gifts of money. The French inhabitants of Quebec,\r\njoining with those of English origin, shipped a thousand and forty\r\nbushels of wheat. Delaware was so much in earnest that it devised plans\r\nfor sending relief annually. All Maryland and all Virginia were\r\ncontributing liberally and cheerfully, being resolved that the men of\r\nBoston, who were deprived of their daily labour, should not lose their\r\ndaily bread, nor be compelled to change their residence for want. In\r\nFairfax county, Washington presided at a spirited meeting, and headed a\r\nsubscription paper with his own gift of fifty pounds. A special\r\nchronicle could hardly enumerate all the generous deeds. Cheered by the\r\nuniversal sympathy, the inhabitants of Boston 'were determined to hold\r\nout and appeal to the justice of the colonies and of the world;'\r\ntrusting in God that 'these things should be overruled for the\r\nestablishment of liberty, virtue and happiness in America.'\"[340]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of inquiry, as to how information could be so rapidly\r\ncirculated throughout colonies sparsely settled over a territory larger\r\nthan that of Europe, and expressions of sentiment and feeling elicited\r\nfrom their remotest settlements? For, as Dr. Ramsay says, \"in the three\r\nfirst months which followed the shutting up of the port of Boston, the\r\ninhabitants of the colonies, in hundreds of small circles as well as in\r\ntheir Provincial Assemblies and Congresses, expressed their abhorrence\r\nof the late proceedings of the British Parliament against Massachusetts;\r\ntheir concurrence in the proposed measure of appointing deputies for a\r\n_General_ Congress; and their willingness to do and suffer whatever\r\nshould be judged conducive to the establishment of their\r\nliberties.\"[341] \"In order to understand,\" says the same author, \"the\r\nmode by which this flame was spread with such rapidity over so great an\r\nextent of country, it is necessary to observe that the several colonies\r\nwere divided into counties, and these again subdivided into districts,\r\ndistinguished by the names of towns, townships, precincts, hundreds, or\r\nparishes. In New England, the subdivisions which are called towns were,\r\nby law, bodies corporate; had their regular meetings, and might be\r\noccasionally convened by their officers. The advantages derived from\r\nthese meetings, by uniting the whole body of the people in the measures\r\ntaken to oppose the Stamp Act, induced other provinces to follow the\r\nexample. Accordingly, under the Association which was formed to oppose\r\nthe Revenue Act of 1767, Committees were established, not only in the\r\ncapital of every province, but in most of the subordinate districts.\r\nGreat Britain, without designing it, had, by her two preceding attempts\r\nat American revenue, taught her colonies not only the advantage but the\r\nmeans of union. The system of Committees which prevailed in 1765, and\r\nalso in 1767, was revived in 1774. By them there was a quick\r\ntransmission of intelligence from the capital towns through the\r\nsubordinate districts to the whole body of the people; a union of\r\ncounsels and measures was effected, among widely disseminated\r\ninhabitants.\"[342]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the three Acts passed by Parliament in respect\r\nto Massachusetts, and the fourth, for quartering soldiers in towns,\r\nchanged the Charter of the province, and multiplied the causes of\r\ndifference between Great Britain and the colonies. To the causes of\r\ndissatisfaction in the colonies arising from the taxing of them assumed\r\nby Parliament (now only threepence a pound on tea), the arrangement with\r\nthe East India Company and the Courts of Admiralty, depriving the\r\ncolonists of the right of trial by jury, were now added the Boston Port\r\nBill, the Regulating Act, the Act which essentially changed the\r\nchartered Constitution of Massachusetts, and the Act which transferred\r\nGovernment officers accused of murder, to be removed to England. Mr.\r\nBancroft justly observes that \"the Regulating Act complicated the\r\nquestion between America and Great Britain. The country, under the\r\nadvice of Pennsylvania, might have indemnified the East India Company,\r\nmight have obtained by importunity the repeal of the tax on tea, or\r\nmight have borne the duty, as it had borne that on wine; but Parliament,\r\nafter ten years of premeditation, had exercised the power to abrogate\r\nthe laws and to change the Charter of a province without its consent;\r\nand on this arose the conflict of the American Revolution.\"[343]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: Marshall's History of the American Colonies, Chap. xiv.,\r\npp. 406, 407.\r\n\r\n\"Resolutions were passed in every colony in which Legislatures were\r\nconvened, or delegates assembled in Convention, manifesting different\r\ndegrees of resentment, but concurring in the same great principles.

So alarmed was Governor Gage, that after he had\r\nsummoned the new Legislature to meet him at Salem, he countermanded his\r\nsummons by proclamation; but which was considered unlawful, and the\r\nAssembly met, organized itself, and passed resolutions on grievances,\r\nand adopted other proceedings to further the opposition to the new Act\r\nand other Acts complained of.\r\n\r\nEven the Courts could not be held. At Boston the judges took their\r\nseats, and the usual proclamations were made; when the men who had been\r\nreturned as jurors, one and all, refused to take the oath. Being asked\r\nwhy they refused, Thomas Chase, one of the petit jury, gave as his\r\nreason, \"that the Chief Justice of the Court stood impeached by the late\r\nrepresentatives of the province.\" In a paper offered by the jury, the\r\njudges found their authority disputed for further reasons, that the\r\nCharter of the province had been changed with no warrant but an Act of\r\nParliament, and that three of the judges, in violation of the\r\nConstitution, had accepted seats in the new Council. The Chief Justice\r\nand his colleagues repairing in a body to the Governor represented the\r\nimpossibility of exercising their office in Boston or in any other part\r\nof the province; the army was too small for their protection; and\r\nbesides, none would act as jurors. Thus the authority of the new\r\nGovernment, as established by Act of Parliament, perished in the\r\npresence of the Governor, the judges and the army.--_Ib._, pp. 111, 112.\r\n\r\nThe English historian, Dr. Andrews, remarks on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"The list of the new (Legislative) Council appointed by the Crown\r\nconsisted of thirty-six members. But twelve of the number declined their\r\ncommissions, and most of those who accepted were speedily obliged to\r\nresign them in order to save their property and persons from the fury of\r\nthe multitude. The judges newly appointed experienced much the same\r\ntreatment. All the inferior officers of the Courts of Judicature, the\r\nclerks, the juries, and all others concerned, explicitly refused to act\r\nunder the new laws. In some places the populace shut up the avenues to\r\nthe court-houses; and upon being required to make way for the judges and\r\nofficers of the court, they declared that they knew of no court nor\r\nestablishment in the province contrary to the ancient usages and forms,\r\nand would recognize none.\r\n\r\n\"The former Constitution being thus destroyed by the British\r\nLegislature, and the people refusing to acknowledge that which was\r\nsubstituted in its room, a dissolution of all government necessarily\r\nensued. The resolution to oppose the designs of Great Britain produced\r\noccasionally some commotions; but no other consequences followed this\r\ndefect of government. Peace and good order remained everywhere\r\nthroughout the province, and the people demeaned themselves with as much\r\nregularity as if the laws still continued in their full and formal\r\nrigour.\" (Andrews' History of the War, Vol. I., pp. 145, 146.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL CONGRESS OR CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA, SEPTEMBER AND\r\nOCTOBER, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word Congress, in relation to the United States, is synonymous with\r\nthe word Parliament in Great Britain, signifying the Legislature of the\r\nnation at large; but before the revolution the word Congress was used,\r\nfor the most part, as synonymous with Convention--a voluntary meeting of\r\ndelegates elected by towns or counties for certain purposes. A meeting\r\nof delegates from the several towns of a county was called a _Congress_,\r\nor Convention of such county; a meeting of delegates of the several\r\ntowns of a province was called a Provincial Congress, or Convention; and\r\na meeting of _delegates_ of the several County Conventions in the\r\nseveral provinces was called a _General_ or _Continental_ Congress,\r\nthough they possessed no _legal_ power, and their resolutions and\r\naddresses were the mere expressions of opinion or advice.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Continental Congress that assembled in Philadelphia the 5th\r\nof September, 1774--not a legislative or executive body possessing or\r\nassuming any legislative or executive power--a body consisting of\r\nfifty-five delegates elected by the representatives of twelve out of the\r\nthirteen provinces--Georgia, the youngest and smallest province, not\r\nhaving elected delegates. The sittings of this body, or Congress, as it\r\nwas called, continued about eight weeks, and its proceedings were\r\nconducted with all the forms of a Legislative Assembly, but with closed\r\ndoors, and under the pledge of secrecy, until dissolved by the authority\r\nof the Congress itself.\r\n\r\nEach day's proceedings was commenced with prayer by some minister. Mr.\r\nPeyton Randolph, Speaker of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, was\r\nelected President, and Mr. Charles Thompson, of Pennsylvania, was chosen\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nAfter deciding upon the mode of conducting the business, it was\r\nresolved, after lengthened discussion, that each colony should be equal\r\nin voting--each colony having one vote, whatever might be the number of\r\nits delegates.\r\n\r\nThis Congress consisted of the assembled representatives of the American\r\ncolonies, and truly expressed their grievances, opinions, and feelings.\r\nAs the proceedings were with closed doors, the utterances of individuals\r\nwere not reported; but in the reported results of their deliberations\r\nthere is not an opinion or wish expressed which does not savour of\r\naffection to the mother country and loyalty to the British Constitution.\r\nDown to this ninth or last year of the agitation which commenced with\r\nthe passing of the Stamp Act, before bloody conflicts took place between\r\nBritish soldiers and inhabitants of Massachusetts, there was not a\r\nresolution or petition or address adopted by any Congress, or\r\nConvention, or public meeting in the colonies, that contained a\r\nprinciple or sentiment which has not been professed by the loyal\r\ninhabitants of British America, and which is not recognized at this day\r\nby the British Government and enjoyed by the people in all the provinces\r\nof the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of these remarks will appear from a summary of the\r\nproceedings of this Continental Congress, and extracts from its\r\naddresses, which will show that the colonies, without exception, were as\r\nloyal to their constitutional sovereign as they were to their\r\nconstitutional rights,[344] though in royal messages and ministerial\r\nspeeches in Parliament their petitions and remonstrances were called\r\ntreason, and the authors of them were termed rebels and traitors. The\r\nprincipal acts of this Congress were a Declaration of Rights; an address\r\nto the King; an address to the people of Great Britain; a memorial to\r\nthe Americans; a letter to the people of Canada. Non-importation and\r\nnon-exportation agreements were adopted and signed by all the members;\r\nand Committees of Vigilance were appointed.\r\n\r\n\"Then on the 26th of October, the 'fifty-five' separated and returned to\r\ntheir homes, determined, as they expressed it, 'that they were\r\nthemselves to stand or fall with the liberties of America.'\"[345]\r\n\r\nAmong the first important acts of this Congress was the declaration of\r\ncolonial rights, grievances, and policy. As this part of their\r\nproceedings contains the whole case of the colonies as stated by their\r\nown representatives, I will give it, though long, in their own words, in\r\na note.[346] This elaborate and ably written paper does not appear to\r\ncontain a sentiment of treason, nor anything which the members of the\r\nCongress had not a right to express and complain of as British subjects;\r\nwhile they explicitly recognized in Parliament all the authority which\r\ncould be constitutionally claimed for it, and which was requisite for\r\nBritish supremacy over the colonies, or which had ever been exercised\r\nbefore 1764.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October, the Congress, after long consideration,\r\nunanimously resolved--\r\n\r\n\"That a loyal address to his Majesty be prepared, dutifully requesting\r\nthe Royal attention to the grievances which alarm and distress his\r\nMajesty's faithful subjects in North America, and entreating his\r\nMajesty's gracious interposition to remove such grievances, and thereby\r\nto restore to Great Britain and the colonies that harmony so necessary\r\nto the happiness of the British empire, and so ardently desired by all\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThis address or petition, like all the papers emanating from this\r\nCongress, was written with consummate ability.[347] In this petition to\r\nthe King, the Congress begged leave to lay their grievances before the\r\nThrone. After a particular enumeration of these, they observed that they\r\nwholly arose from a destructive system of colony administration adopted\r\nsince the conclusion of the last war. They assured his Majesty that they\r\nhad made such provision for defraying the charges of the administration\r\nof justice, and the support of civil government, as had been judged\r\njust, and suitable to their respective circumstances; and that for the\r\ndefence, protection, and security of the colonies, their militia would\r\nbe fully sufficient in time of peace; and in case of war, they were\r\nready and willing, when constitutionally required, to exert their most\r\nstrenuous efforts in granting supplies and raising forces. They said,\r\n\"We ask but for peace, liberty, and safety. We wish not a diminution of\r\nthe prerogative; nor do we solicit the grant of any new right in our\r\nfavour. Your royal authority over us, and our connection with Great\r\nBritain, we shall always carefully and zealously endeavour to support\r\nand maintain.\"[348] They concluded their masterly and touching address\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Permit us, then, most gracious Sovereign, in the name of all your\r\nfaithful people in America, with the utmost humility, to implore you,\r\nfor the honour of Almighty God, whose pure religion our enemies are\r\nundermining; for your glory, which can be advanced only by rendering\r\nyour subjects happy and keeping them united; for the interest of your\r\nfamily, depending on an adherence to the principles that enthroned it;\r\nfor the safety and welfare of your kingdom and dominions, threatened\r\nwith almost unavoidable dangers and distresses, that your Majesty, as\r\nthe loving Father of your whole people, connected by the same bonds of\r\nlaw, loyalty, faith, and blood, though dwelling in various countries,\r\nwill not suffer the transcendent relation formed by these ties to be\r\nfarther violated in certain expectation of efforts that, if attained,\r\nnever can compensate for the calamities through which they must be\r\ngained.\"[349]\r\n\r\nTheir address to the people of Great Britain is equally earnest and\r\nstatesmanlike. Two or three passages, as samples, must suffice. After\r\nstating the serious condition of America, and the oppressions and\r\nmisrepresentations of their conduct, and their claim to be as free as\r\ntheir fellow-subjects in Great Britain, they say:\r\n\r\n\"Are not the proprietors of the soil of Great Britain lords of their own\r\nproperty? Can it be taken from them without their consent? Will they\r\nyield it to the arbitrary disposal of any men or number of men\r\nwhatsoever? You know they will not.\r\n\r\n\"Why then are the proprietors of the soil of America less lords of their\r\nproperty than you are of yours; or why should they submit it to the\r\ndisposal of your Parliament, or any other Parliament or Council in the\r\nworld, not of their election? Can the intervention of the sea that\r\ndivides us cause disparity of rights; or can any reason be given why\r\nEnglish subjects who live three thousand miles distant from the royal\r\npalace should enjoy less liberty than those who are three hundred miles\r\ndistant from it? Reason looks with indignation on such distinctions, and\r\nfreemen can never perceive their propriety.\"\r\n\r\nThey conclude their address to their fellow-subjects in Great Britain in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\"We believe there is yet much virtue, much justice, and much public\r\nspirit in the English nation. To that justice we now appeal. You have\r\nbeen told that we are seditious, impatient of government, and desirous\r\nof independence. Be assured that these are not facts, but calumnies.\r\nPermit us to be as free as yourselves, and we shall ever esteem a union\r\nwith you to be our greatest glory and our greatest happiness; and we\r\nshall ever be ready to contribute all in our power to the welfare of the\r\nempire. We shall consider your enemies as our enemies, and your interest\r\nas our own.\r\n\r\n\"But if you are determined that your Ministers shall wantonly sport with\r\nthe rights of mankind; if neither the voice of justice, the dictates of\r\nlaw, the principles of the Constitution, nor the suggestions of humanity\r\ncan restrain your hands from shedding human blood in such an impious\r\ncause, we must then tell you that we will never submit to be hewers of\r\nwood and drawers of water to any Ministry or nation in the world.\r\n\r\n\"_Place us in the same situation that we were at the close of the late\r\nwar, and our former harmony will be restored._\"\r\n\r\nThe address of the members of this Congress to their constituents is a\r\nlucid exposition of the several causes which had led to the then\r\nexisting state of things, and is replete with earnest but temperate\r\nargument to prove that their liberties must be destroyed, and the\r\nsecurity of their persons and property annihilated, by submission to the\r\npretensions of the British Ministry and Parliament. They state that the\r\nfirst object of the Congress was to unite the people of America, by\r\ndemonstrating the sincerity and earnestness with which reconciliation\r\nhad been sought with Great Britain upon terms compatible with British\r\nliberty. After expressing their confidence in the efficacy of the\r\npassive commercial resistance which had been adopted, they conclude\r\ntheir address thus:\r\n\r\n\"Your own salvation and that of your posterity now depend upon\r\nyourselves. You have already shown that you entertain a proper sense of\r\nthe blessings you are striving to retain. Against the temporary\r\ninconveniences you may suffer from a stoppage of trade, you will weigh\r\nin the opposite balance the endless miseries you and your descendants\r\nmust endure from an established arbitrary power.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"Motives thus cogent, arising from the emergency of your unhappy\r\ncondition, must excite your utmost diligence and zeal to give all\r\npossible strength and energy to pacific measures calculated for your\r\nrelief. But we think ourselves bound in duty to observe to you, that the\r\nschemes agitated against the colonies have been so conducted as to\r\nrender it prudent that you should extend your views to mournful events,\r\nand be in all respects prepared for every contingency. Above all things,\r\nwe earnestly entreat you, with devotion of spirit, penitence of heart,\r\nand amendment of life, to humble yourselves, and implore the favour of\r\nAlmighty God; and we fervently beseech His Divine goodness to take you\r\ninto His gracious protection.\"\r\n\r\nThe letters addressed to the other colonies not represented in the\r\nCongress require no special reference or remark.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the business before them, this first General Congress\r\nin America recommended that another Congress should be held in the same\r\nplace on the tenth day of the succeeding May, 1775, \"unless redress of\r\ntheir grievances should be previously obtained,\" and recommending to all\r\nthe colonies \"to choose deputies as soon as possible, to be ready to\r\nattend at that time and place, should events make their meeting\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nI have presented an embodiment of the complaints, sentiments, and wishes\r\nof the American colonies in the words of their elected representatives\r\nin their first General Congress. I have done so for two reasons: First,\r\nto correct as far as I can the erroneous impression of thousands of\r\nEnglish and Canadian readers, that during the ten years' conflict of\r\nwords, before the conflict of arms, between the British Ministry and\r\nParliament and Colonies, the colonists entertained opinions and views\r\nincompatible with subordination to the mother country, and were\r\npreparing the way for separation from it. Such an opinion is utterly\r\nerroneous. Whatever solitary individuals may have thought or wished, the\r\npetitions and resolutions adopted by the complaining colonists during\r\nthese ten years of agitation breathe as pure a spirit of loyalty as they\r\ndo of liberty; and in no instance did they ask for more, or as much, as\r\nthe inhabitants of the provinces of the Canadian Dominion this day\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nMy second reason for thus quoting the very words of the declarations and\r\npetitions of the colonists is to show the injustice with which they were\r\nrepresented and treated by the British Ministry, Parliament, and press\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped by the Congress that their address to the people of England\r\nwould have a happy influence in favour of the colonies upon the public\r\nmind, and tell favourably on the English elections, which took place the\r\nlatter part of the year 1774; but the elections were suddenly ordered\r\nbefore the proceedings of the Congress could be published in England.\r\nThe elections, of course, resulted adversely to the colonies; and the\r\nnew Parliament was more subservient to the Ministry against the colonies\r\nthan the preceding Parliament.[350]\r\n\r\nThis new Parliament met the 30th day of November, when the King was\r\nadvised to inform them, among other things, \"that a most daring spirit\r\nof resistance and disobedience to the laws unhappily prevailed in the\r\nprovince of Massachusetts, and had broken forth in fresh violences of a\r\nvery criminal nature; that these proceedings had been countenanced and\r\nencouraged in his other colonies; that unwarrantable attempts had been\r\nmade to obstruct the commerce of his kingdom by unlawful combinations;\r\nand that he had taken such measures and given such orders as he judged\r\nmost proper and effectual for carrying into execution the laws which\r\nwere passed in the last session of the late Parliament relative to the\r\nprovince of Massachusetts.\"[351]\r\n\r\nAnswers were adopted in both Houses of Parliament re-echoing the\r\nsentiments of the Royal Speech, but not without vehement debates. There\r\nwas a considerable minority in both Lords and Commons that sympathised\r\nwith the colonies, and condemned the Ministerial policy and the Acts of\r\nthe previous Parliament complained of. In the Commons, the Minister was\r\nreminded of the great effects he had predicted from the American acts.\r\n\"They were to humble that whole continent without further trouble; and\r\nthe punishment of Boston was to strike so universal a panic in all the\r\ncolonies that it would be totally abandoned, and instead of obtaining\r\nrelief, a dread of the same fate would awe the other provinces to a most\r\nrespectful submission.\"[352] But the address, re-echoing the Royal\r\nSpeech for coercion, was adopted by a majority of two to one.\r\n\r\nIn the Lords a similar address was passed by a large majority; but the\r\nLords Richmond, Portland, Rockingham, Stamford, Torrington, Ponsonby,\r\nWycombe, and Camden entered upon the journals a protest against it,\r\nwhich concluded in the following memorable words:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the mischievous designs or the inconsiderate temerity,\r\nwe wish to be known as persons who have disapproved of measures so\r\ninjurious in their past effects and future tendency, and who are not in\r\nhaste, without inquiry or information, to commit ourselves in\r\ndeclarations which may precipitate our country into all the calamities\r\nof civil war.\"[353]\r\n\r\nBefore the adjournment of the new Parliament for the Christmas holidays,\r\nthe papers containing the proceedings of the Continental Congress at\r\nPhiladelphia reached England. The first impression made by them is said\r\nto have been in favour of America. The Ministry seemed staggered, and\r\ntheir opposers triumphed in the fulfilment of their own predictions as\r\nto the effects of Ministerial acts and policy in America. The Earl of\r\nDartmouth, Secretary of State for the Colonies, after a day's perusal of\r\nthese papers, said that the petition of the Congress to the King (of\r\nwhich extracts have been given above) was a decent and proper one. He\r\ncheerfully undertook to present it to the King; and reported afterwards\r\nthat his Majesty was pleased to receive it very graciously, and would\r\nlay it before his two Houses of Parliament. From these favourable\r\ncircumstances, the friends of conciliation anticipated that the petition\r\nof the Colonial Congress would be made the basis of a change of measures\r\nand policy in regard to the colonies. But these hopes were of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: The royal historian, Andrews, states:\r\n\r\n\"The delegates were enjoined, by the instructions they had received from\r\ntheir constituents, solemnly to acknowledge the sovereignty of Great\r\nBritain over them, and their willingness to pay her the fullest\r\nobedience, as far _as_ the constitution authorized her to demand it;\r\nthey were to disclaim all notions of separating from her; and to declare\r\nit was with the deepest regret they beheld a suspension of that\r\nconfidence and affection which had so long, and so happily for both,\r\nsubsisted between Great Britain and her colonies.\r\n\r\n\"But they were no less carefully directed at the same time to assert the\r\nrights transmitted to them by their ancestors. These rights they would\r\nnever surrender, and would maintain them at all perils. They were\r\nentitled to all the privileges of British subjects, and would not yield\r\nto the unjust pretensions of Parliament, which, in the present treatment\r\nof the colonies, had violated the principles of the constitution and\r\ngiven them just occasion to be dissatisfied and to rise in opposition.\r\nParliament might depend this opposition would never cease until those\r\nActs were wholly repealed that had been the radical cause of the present\r\ndisturbances.\" (Andrews' History of the War with America, Spain and\r\nHolland, from 1775 to 1783, pp. 156, 157.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: Elliott's New England History, Vol. II., Chap. xvi., p.\r\n289.\r\n\r\n\"Washington and Lee believed the non-importation and exportation\r\nagreements would open the eyes of England; but Patrick Henry agreed with\r\nJohn and Samuel Adams in believing that _force_ must decide it, and,\r\nlike them, was ready to meet any emergency.\"--_Ib._\r\n\r\n\"The New York Legislature at once repudiated the doings of the Congress;\r\nbut elsewhere it met with a hearty response.\"--_Ib._, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: \"Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British\r\nParliament, claiming a power, of right, to bind the people of America by\r\nstatutes in all cases whatsoever, hath in some Acts expressly imposed\r\ntaxes on them; and in others, under various pretences, but in fact for\r\nthe purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties payable\r\nin these colonies, established a Board of Commissioners with\r\nunconstitutional powers, and extended the jurisdiction of Courts of\r\nAdmiralty, not only for collecting the said duties, but for the trial of\r\ncauses merely arising within the body of a county:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges, who before held\r\nonly estates at will in their offices, have been made dependent on the\r\nCrown alone for their salaries, and standing armies kept in times of\r\npeace:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas it has lately been resolved in Parliament, that by force of\r\na statute made in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry\r\nVIII., colonists may be transported to England and tried there upon\r\naccusations for treasons, and misprisions and concealments of treasons\r\ncommitted in the colonies, and by a late statute such trials have been\r\ndirected in cases therein mentioned:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, in the last session of Parliament, three statutes were\r\nmade--one entitled, 'An Act to discontinue, in such manner and for such\r\ntime as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or\r\nshipping of goods, wares, and merchandise, at the town, and within the\r\nharbour of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in North\r\nAmerica;' another entitled, 'An Act for the better regulating the\r\nGovernment of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England;' and\r\nanother Act entitled, 'An Act for the impartial administration of\r\njustice, in the cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in\r\nthe execution of the law, or for the suppression of riots and tumults,\r\nin the province of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England;' and another\r\nstatute was then made, 'for making more effectual provision for the\r\ngovernment of the province of Quebec,' etc.--all which statutes are\r\nimpolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutional, and most\r\ndangerous and destructive of American rights:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas assemblies have been frequently dissolved, contrary to the\r\nrights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances;\r\nand their dutiful, humble, loyal, and reasonable petitions to the Crown\r\nfor redress have been repeatedly treated with contempt by his Majesty's\r\nMinisters of State; the good people of the several colonies of New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Castle, Kent and\r\nSussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South\r\nCarolina, justly alarmed at the arbitrary proceedings of Parliament and\r\nAdministration, have severally elected, constituted, and appointed\r\ndeputies to meet and sit in General Congress, in the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, in order to obtain such establishment as that their\r\nreligion, laws, and liberties may not be subverted; whereupon the\r\ndeputies so appointed being now assembled, in a full and free\r\nrepresentation of these colonies, taking into their most serious\r\nconsideration the best means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the\r\nfirst place, as Englishmen, what their ancestors in like cases have\r\nusually done, for asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties,\r\nDECLARE, that the inhabitants of the English colonies in North America,\r\nby the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English\r\nConstitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following\r\nrights:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 1st, That they are entitled to life, liberty, and\r\nproperty; and they have never ceded to any sovereign power whatever a\r\nright to dispose of either without their consent.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 2nd, That our ancestors, who first settled these\r\ncolonies, were, at the time of their emigration from the mother country,\r\nentitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and\r\nnatural-born subjects within the realm of England.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 3rd, That by such emigration they by no means\r\nforfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights, but that they were,\r\nand their descendants now are, entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of\r\nall such of them as their local and other circumstances enabled them to\r\nexercise and enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, 4th, That the foundation of English liberty and of all free\r\ngovernment is a right in their people to participate in their\r\nLegislative Council; and as the English colonists are not represented,\r\nand from their local and other circumstances cannot properly be\r\nrepresented in the British Parliament, they are entitled to a free and\r\nexclusive power of legislation in their several Provincial Legislatures,\r\nwhere their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases\r\nof taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their\r\nSovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed.\r\nBut from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interest\r\nof both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such Acts\r\nof the British Parliament as are _bona fide_ restrained to the\r\nregulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the\r\ncommercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the\r\ncommercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of\r\ntaxation, internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects in\r\nAmerica without their consent.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 5th, That the respective colonies are entitled to\r\nthe common law of England, and more especially to the great and\r\ninestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage,\r\naccording to the course of that law.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, 6th, That they are entitled to the benefit of such of the\r\nEnglish statutes as existed at the time of their colonization; and which\r\nthey have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their\r\nseveral local and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 7th, That these his Majesty's colonies are likewise\r\nentitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to\r\nthem by Royal Charters, or secured by their several codes of Provincial\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 8th, That they have a right peaceably to assemble,\r\nconsider of their grievances, and petition the King; and that all\r\nprosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments for the same,\r\nare illegal.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 9th, That the keeping a standing army in these\r\ncolonies, in times of peace, without the consent of the Legislature of\r\nthe colony in which such army is kept, is against law.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D. 10th, It is indispensably necessary to good\r\ngovernment, and rendered essential by the English constitution, that the\r\nconstituent branches of the Legislature be independent of each other;\r\nthat, therefore, the exercise of legislative power in several colonies,\r\nby a Council appointed, during pleasure, by the Crown, is\r\nunconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to the freedom of American\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\"All and each of which the aforesaid deputies, in behalf of themselves\r\nand their constituents, do claim, demand, and insist on, as their\r\nindubitable rights and liberties; which cannot be legally taken from\r\nthem, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own\r\nconsent, by their representatives in their several Provincial\r\nLegislatures.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of our inquiry, we find many infringements and violations\r\nof the foregoing rights, which, from an ardent desire that harmony and\r\nmutual intercourse of affection and interest may be restored, we pass\r\nover for the present, and proceed to state such Acts and measures as\r\nhave been adopted since the last war, which demonstrate a system formed\r\nto enslave America.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, N. C. D., That the following Acts of Parliament are\r\ninfringements and violations of the rights of the colonies; and that the\r\nrepeal of them is essentially necessary, in order to restore harmony\r\nbetween Great Britain and the American colonies, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"The several Acts of 4 Geo.

III.\r\nchap. 22, which imposed duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in\r\nAmerica, extend the power of the Admiralty Courts beyond their ancient\r\nlimits; deprive the American subject of trial by jury; authorize the\r\njudge's certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages that he\r\nmight otherwise be liable to; requiring oppressive security from a\r\nclaimant of ships and goods seized, before he shall be allowed to defend\r\nhis property, and are subversive of American rights.\r\n\r\n\"Also 12 Geo. III. chap. 24, intituled 'An Act for the better securing\r\nhis Majesty's dockyards, magazines, ships, ammunition, and stores,'\r\nwhich declares a new offence in America, and deprives the American\r\nsubject of a constitutional trial by a jury of the vicinage, by\r\nauthorizing the trial of any person charged with the committing of any\r\noffence described in the said Act, out of the realm, to be indicted and\r\ntried for the same in any shire or county within the realm.\r\n\r\n\"Also the three Acts passed in the last session of Parliament, for\r\nstopping the port and blocking up the harbour of Boston, for altering\r\nthe Charter and Government of Massachusetts Bay, and that which is\r\nintituled 'An Act for the better administration of justice,' etc.\r\n\r\n\"Also, the Act passed in the same session for establishing the Roman\r\nCatholic religion in the province of Quebec, abolishing the equitable\r\nsystem of English laws, and erecting a tyranny there, to the great\r\ndanger (from so total a dissimilarity of religion, law, and government)\r\nof the neighbouring British colonies, by the assistance of whose blood\r\nand treasure the said country was conquered from France.\r\n\r\n\"Also, the Act passed in the same session for the better providing\r\nsuitable quarters for officers and soldiers in his Majesty's service in\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\n\"Also, that the keeping a standing army in several of these colonies, in\r\ntime of peace, without the consent of the Legislature of that colony in\r\nwhich such army is kept, is against law.\r\n\r\n\"To these grievous Acts and measures, Americans cannot submit; but in\r\nhopes their fellow-subjects in Great Britain will, on a revision of\r\nthem, restore us to that state in which both countries found happiness\r\nand prosperity, we have for the present only resolved to pursue the\r\nfollowing peaceable measures: 1. To enter into a non-importation,\r\nnon-consumption, and non-exportation agreement or association; 2. To\r\nprepare an address to the people of Great Britain, and a memorial to the\r\ninhabitants of British America; and 3. To prepare a loyal address to his\r\nMajesty, agreeable to resolutions already entered into.\" (Marshall's\r\nAmerican Colonial History.

It was their design to have the whole\r\nbusiness of elections over before the inconveniences of non-importation\r\ncould be felt. The nation was thus surprised into an election. Without\r\nknowing that the late American acts had driven the colonies into a firm\r\ncombination to support and make common cause with the people of\r\nMassachusetts, a new Parliament was returned, which met thirty-four days\r\nafter the proceedings of Congress were first published in Philadelphia,\r\nand before they were known in Great Britain.

He moved:\r\n\r\n\"That a humble address be presented to his Majesty, most humbly to\r\nadvise and beseech him that, in order to open the way toward a happy\r\nsettlement of the dangerous troubles in America, by beginning to allay\r\nferments and soften animosities there, and above all for preventing, in\r\nthe meantime, any sudden catastrophe at Boston, now suffering under\r\ndaily irritation of an army before their eyes, posted in their town, it\r\nmay graciously please his Majesty that immediate orders may be\r\ndespatched to General Gage for removing his Majesty's forces from the\r\ntown of Boston as soon as the rigours of the season and other\r\ncircumstances indispensable to the safety and accommodation of said\r\ntroops may render the same practicable.\"\r\n\r\nLord Chatham advocated his motion in a very pathetic speech, and was\r\nsupported by speeches by the Marquis of Rockingham, Lords Shelburne and\r\nCamden, and petitions from merchants and manufacturers throughout the\r\nkingdom, and most prominently by those of London and Bristol. But the\r\nmotion was negatived by a majority of 63 to 13.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his speech Lord Chatham said:\r\n\r\n\"Resistance to your acts was as necessary as it was just; and your\r\nimperious doctrine of the omnipotence of Parliament and the necessity of\r\nsubmission will be found equally impotent to convince or to enslave.\r\n\r\n\"The means of enforcing the thraldom are as weak in practice as they are\r\nunjust in principle. General Gage and the troops under his command are\r\npenned up, pining in inglorious inactivity. You may call them an army of\r\nsafety and of guard, but they are in truth an army of impotence; and to\r\nmake the folly equal to the disgrace, they are an army of irritation.\r\n\r\n\"But this tameness, however contemptible, cannot be censured; for the\r\nfirst drop of blood shed in civil and unnatural war will make a wound\r\nthat years, perhaps ages, may not heal.... The indiscriminate hand of\r\nvengeance has lumped together innocent and guilty; with all the\r\nformalities of hostility, has blocked up the town of Boston, and reduced\r\nto beggary and famine thirty thousand inhabitants....\r\n\r\n\"When your lordships look at the papers transmitted to us from\r\nAmerica--when you consider their decency, firmness, and wisdom, you\r\ncannot but respect their cause, and wish to make it your own. For\r\nmyself, I must avow that in all my reading--and I have read Thucydides,\r\nand have studied the master-states of the world--for solidity of reason,\r\nforce of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion under a complication of\r\ndifficult circumstances, no nation or body of men can stand in\r\npreference to the General Congress of Philadelphia. The histories of\r\nGreece and Rome give us nothing equal to it, and all attempts to impose\r\nservitude upon such a mighty continental nation must be vain. We shall\r\nbe forced ultimately to retract; let us retract while we can, not when\r\nwe must. These violent Acts must be repealed; you will repeal them; I\r\npledge myself for it, I stake my reputation upon it, that you will in\r\nthe end repeal them. Avoid, then, this humiliating necessity. With a\r\ndignity becoming your exalted station, make the first advance towards\r\nconcord, peace, and happiness; for that is your true dignity. Concession\r\ncomes with better grace from superior power, and establishes solid\r\nconfidence on the foundations of affection and gratitude. Be the first\r\nto spare; throw down the weapons in your hand.\r\n\r\n\"Every motive of justice and policy, of dignity and of prudence, urges\r\nyou to allay the ferment in America by a removal of your troops from\r\nBoston, by a repeal of your Acts of Parliament, and by demonstrating\r\namiable dispositions towards your colonies.... If the Ministers\r\npersevere in thus misadvising and misleading the King, I will not say\r\nthat the King is betrayed, but I will pronounce that the kingdom is\r\nundone; I will not say that they can alienate the affections of his\r\nsubjects from his Crown, but I will affirm that, the American jewel out\r\nof it, they will make the Crown not worth his wearing.\"[354]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Suffolk, with whining vehemence, assured the House that, in\r\nspite of Lord Chatham's prophecy, the Government was resolved to repeal\r\nnot one of the Acts, but to use all possible means to bring the\r\nAmericans to obedience; and after declaiming violently against their\r\nconduct, boasted as \"having been one of the first to advise coercive\r\nmeasures.\"\r\n\r\nEx-Lord Chancellor Camden excelled every other speaker, except Lord\r\nChatham, in the discussion; he declared in the course of his speech:\r\n\r\n\"This I will say, not only as a statesman, politician, and philosopher,\r\nbut as a common lawyer: My lords, you have no right to tax America; the\r\nnatural rights of man, and the immutable laws of nature, are all with\r\nthat people. King, Lords, and Commons are fine-sounding names, but King,\r\nLords, and Commons may become tyrants as well as others. It is as lawful\r\nto resist the tyranny of many as of one. Somebody once asked the great\r\nSelden in what book you might find the law for resisting tyranny. 'It\r\nhas always been the custom of England,' answered Selden, 'and the custom\r\nof England is the law of the land.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter several other speeches and much recrimination, and a\r\ncharacteristic reply from Lord Chatham, his motion was rejected by a\r\nmajority of sixty-eight to eighteen; but the Duke of Cumberland, the\r\nKing's own brother, was one of the minority. The King triumphed in what\r\nhe called \"the very handsome majority,\" and said he was sure \"nothing\r\ncould be more calculated to bring the Americans to submission.\" The\r\nKing's prediction of \"submission\" was followed by more united and\r\nenergetic resistance in the colonies.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Chatham, persevering in his efforts of conciliation,\r\nnotwithstanding the large majority against him, brought in, the 1st of\r\nFebruary, a Bill entitled \"A Provisional Act for Settling the Troubles\r\nin America, and for Asserting the Supreme Legislative Authority and\r\nSuperintending Power of Great Britain over the Colonies.\" The Bill,\r\nhowever, was not allowed to be read the first time, or even to lie on\r\nthe table, but was rejected by a majority of sixty-four to thirty-two--a\r\ncontempt of the colonists and a discourtesy to the noble mover of the\r\nBill without example in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, petitions were presented to the Commons from various\r\ntowns in England, Scotland, and Ireland, by manufacturers and merchants\r\nconnected with the colonial trade. On the 23rd of January, Alderman\r\nHayley presented a petition from the merchants of the City of London\r\ntrading to America, stating at great length the nature and extent of the\r\ntrade, direct and indirect, between Great Britain and America, and the\r\nimmense injury to it by the recent Acts of Parliament, and praying for\r\nrelief; but this petition was conveyed to the \"Committee of Oblivion,\"\r\nas were petitions from the merchants of Glasgow, Liverpool, Norwich and\r\nother towns, on American affairs. These petitions, together with their\r\nadvocates in both Houses of Parliament, showed that the oppressive\r\npolicy and abuse of the Americans were the acts of the Ministry of the\r\nday, and not properly of the English people.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January, Sir George Saville offered to present a petition\r\nfrom Dr. Franklin, Mr. Bollan, and Mr. Lee, stating that they had been\r\nauthorized by the American Continental Congress to present a petition\r\nfrom the Congress to the King, which his Majesty had referred to that\r\nHouse, and that they were able to throw great light upon the subject;\r\nthey therefore prayed to be heard at the bar in support of the petition.\r\nAfter a violent debate the petition was rejected by a majority of 218 to\r\n68.[355]\r\n\r\nLord North on the 2nd of February, moved that the House resolve itself\r\ninto Committee on an address to his Majesty, thanking him for having\r\ncommunicated to the House the several papers relating to the present\r\nstate of the British colonies, and from which \"we find that a part of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects in the province of Massachusetts Bay have\r\nproceeded so far as to resist the authority of the Supreme Legislature;\r\nthat a _rebellion_ at this time actually exists within the said\r\nprovince; and we see, with the utmost concern, that they have been\r\ncountenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements\r\nentered into by his Majesty's subjects in several other colonies, to the\r\ninjury and oppression of many of their innocent fellow-subjects resident\r\nwithin the kingdom of Great Britain and the rest of his Majesty's\r\ndominions. This conduct on their part appears to us the more inexcusable\r\nwhen we consider with how much temper his Majesty and the two Houses of\r\nParliament have acted in support of the laws and constitution of Great\r\nBritain; to declare that we can never so far desert the trust reposed in\r\nus as to relinquish any part of the sovereign authority over all his\r\nMajesty's dominions which by law is invested in his Majesty and the two\r\nHouses of Parliament, and that the conduct of many persons, in several\r\nof the colonies, during the late disturbances, is alone sufficient to\r\nconvince us how necessary this power is for the protection of the lives\r\nand fortunes of all his Majesty's subjects; that we ever have been and\r\nalways shall be ready to pay attention and regard to any real grievances\r\nof any of his Majesty's subjects, which shall, in a dutiful and\r\nconstitutional manner, be laid before us; and whenever any of the\r\ncolonies shall make proper application to us, we shall be ready to\r\nafford them every just and reasonable indulgence; but that, at the same\r\ntime, we consider it our indispensable duty humbly to beseech his\r\nMajesty to take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to\r\nthe laws and authority of the Supreme Legislature; and that we beg\r\nleave, in the most solemn manner, to assure his Majesty that it is our\r\nfixed resolution, at the hazard of our lives and properties, to stand by\r\nhis Majesty against all rebellious attempts, in the maintenance of the\r\njust rights of his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament.\"[356]\r\n\r\nI have given Lord North's proposed address to the King at length, in\r\norder that the reader may understand fully the policy of the Government\r\nat that eventful moment, and the statements on which that policy was\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this address several things may be observed: 1. There is\r\nnot the slightest recognition in it that the American colonists have any\r\nconstitutional rights whatever; they are claimed as the absolute\r\nproperty of King and Parliament, irrespective of local Charters or\r\nLegislatures. 2. It is alleged that Parliament always had been and would\r\nbe \"ready to pay attention to any _real_ grievances of any of his\r\nMajesty's subjects which shall, _in a dutiful and constitutional\r\nmanner_, be laid before us,\" when \"we shall be ready to afford them\r\nevery just and reasonable _indulgence_.\" Yet every one of the hundreds\r\nof petitions which had been sent from the colonies to England for the\r\nprevious ten years, complaining of grievances, was rejected, under one\r\npretext or another, as not having been adopted or transmitted in \"a\r\ndutiful and constitutional manner.\" If a Legislative Assembly proceeded\r\nto prepare a petition of grievances to the King, the King's Governor\r\nimmediately dissolved the Assembly; and when its members afterwards met\r\nin their private capacity and embodied their complaints, their\r\nproceedings were pronounced unlawful and seditious. When township,\r\ncounty, and provincial conventions met and expressed their complaints\r\nand grievances in resolutions and petitions, their proceedings were\r\ndenounced by the Royal representatives as unlawful and rebellious; and\r\nwhen elected representatives from all the provinces (but Georgia)\r\nassembled in Philadelphia to express the complaints and wishes of all\r\nthe provinces, their meeting was declared unlawful, and their petition\r\nto the King a collection of fictitious statements and rebellious\r\nsentiments, though more loyal sentiments to the King, and more full\r\nrecognition of his constitutional prerogatives were never expressed in\r\nany document presented to his Majesty. When that petition of the\r\nContinental congregation was presented to the Earl of Dartmouth, the\r\nhead of the Colonial Department, he said it was a decent and proper\r\ndocument, and he would have pleasure in laying it before the King, who\r\nreferred it to the House of Commons; yet Lord North himself and a\r\nmajority of his colleagues, backed by a majority of the House of\r\nCommons, rejected that petition, refused to consider its statements and\r\nprayers, but instead thereof proposed an address which declared one of\r\nthe colonies in a state of rebellion, abetted by many in other colonies,\r\nadvised military force against the colonies, and assured the King that\r\nthey would stand by his Majesty \"at the hazard of their lives and\r\nproperties, against all rebellious attempts\" to maintain the assumed\r\nrights of his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament over the\r\ncolonies. Yet not one of them ever afterwards risked a hair of his head\r\nin the war which they advised to maintain such rights. 3. It was also as\r\ninsulting and provoking to the colonists as it was unjust, impolitic,\r\nand untrue, to assert that a rebellion \"existed in one province of\r\nAmerica, and was encouraged by many persons in other colonies;\" when not\r\nan act of rebellion existed in any colony, but dissatisfaction, meetings\r\nto express sentiments and adopt petitions founded upon their declining\r\nand agreeing not to buy or drink tea, or buy or wear clothes of English\r\nmanufacture, until English justice should be done to them--all which\r\nthey had a right as British subjects to do, and for doing which those\r\nwere responsible who compelled them to such self-denying acts in the\r\nmaintenance of constitutional rights which are now recognised as such,\r\nat this day, throughout all the colonies of the British empire.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Lord North's motion and statements were\r\nseverely canvassed in the House of Commons. Mr. Dunning, in reply to\r\nLord North, \"insisted that America was not in rebellion, and that every\r\nappearance of riot, disorder, tumult, and sedition the noble lord had so\r\ncarefully recounted arose not from disobedience, treason, or rebellion,\r\nbut was created by the conduct of those whose views were to establish\r\ndespotism.\" The Attorney-General (Thurlow) argued strongly against Mr.\r\nDunning's position that the Americans were not in rebellion, and\r\naffirmed the contrary. General Grant said \"he had served in America,\r\nknew the Americans well, and was certain they would not fight; they\r\nwould never dare to fight an English army; they did not possess any of\r\nthe qualifications necessary to make good soldiers; and that a very\r\nslight force would be more than sufficient for their complete reduction.\r\nHe repeated many of their commonplace expressions, ridiculed their\r\nenthusiasm in religion, and drew a disagreeable picture of their manners\r\nand ways of living.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox entered fully into the question; pointed out the injustice, the\r\ninexpediency, the folly of the motion; prophesied defeat on one side of\r\nthe water, and ruin and punishment on the other. He said, among other\r\nthings, \"The reason why the colonies objected to taxes by Parliament for\r\nrevenue was, that such revenue, in the hands of Government, took out of\r\nthe hands of the people that were to be governed that control which\r\nevery Englishman thinks he ought to have over the Government to which\r\nhis rights and interests are entrusted.\" He moved an amendment to omit\r\nall the motion but the three first lines, and to substitute: \"But\r\ndeploring that the information which they (the papers) had afforded\r\nserved only to convince the House that the measures taken by his\r\nMajesty's servants tended rather to widen than to heal the unhappy\r\ndifferences which had so long subsisted between Great Britain and\r\nAmerica, and praying a speedy alteration of the same.\"\r\n\r\nA long debate ensued; after which the House divided on Mr. Fox's\r\namendment, which was lost by a majority of 304 to 105. Lord North's\r\nmotion was then adopted by a majority of 296 to 106.\r\n\r\nThus was war _virtually_ proclaimed by the British Ministry of the day\r\nand the Parliament (not by the people) of Great Britain against the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February the report of Lord North's address was made to\r\nthe House, when Lord John Cavendish moved to recommit the proposed\r\naddress agreed to in the Committee. He strongly recommended the\r\nreconsideration of a measure which he deemed fraught with much mischief.\r\nHe commented on the proposed address; thought it improper to assert that\r\nrebellion exists; mentioned the insecurity created by the Act changing\r\nthe Government of Massachusetts Bay; said the inhabitants knew not for a\r\nmoment under what Government they lived.\r\n\r\nA long discussion ensued. On the side of absolute prerogative, and of\r\nsubduing the colonies to it by military force, spoke Mr. Grenville,\r\nCaptain Harvey, Sir William Mayne, Mr. Stanley, Mr. Adam, Mr. Scott, the\r\nSolicitor-General (Wedderburn, who grossly insulted Dr. Franklin before\r\nthe Privy Council), Mr. Mackworth, and Mr. Sawbridge. For the\r\nrecommitting the address, and in favour of a conciliatory policy towards\r\nthe colonies, spoke, besides Lord John Cavendish, the mover, Mr. Lumley,\r\nthe Lord Mayor of London, Rt. Hon. T. Townshend, Mr. Jolyffe, Lord\r\nTruham, Governor Johnstone, Mr. Burke, and Colonel Barré.\r\n\r\nA conference was held between the Lords and Commons, and the address was\r\nmade the joint address of both Houses of Parliament and presented to the\r\nKing the 9th of February; to which the King replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My Lords and Gentlemen,--I thank you for this very dutiful address, and\r\nfor the affectionate and solemn assurances you give me of your support\r\nin maintaining the just rights of my crown and of the two Houses of\r\nParliament; and you may depend on my taking the most speedy and\r\neffectual measures for enforcing due obedience to the laws and authority\r\nof the Supreme Legislature. When any of my colonies shall make a proper\r\nand dutiful application, I shall be ready to concur with you in\r\naffording them every just and reasonable indulgence; and it is my ardent\r\nwish that this disposition on our part may have a happy effect on the\r\ntemper and conduct of my subjects in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"disposition\" of \"indulgence,\" shown by Parliament was simply the\r\nenforcement of its declaratory Act of absolute power to bind the\r\ncolonies in all cases whatsoever, and \"the proper and dutiful\r\napplication of any colony\" was simply a renunciation of all they had\r\nclaimed as their constitutional rights--a penitent prayer of forgiveness\r\nfor having avowed and maintained those rights, and of submitting all\r\ntheir rights and interests to the absolute and merciful consideration of\r\nthe King and his Parliament, and that in the presence of the\r\nparliamentary enactments and royal institutions of the previous ten\r\nyears. During those years, the Parliament, with royal consent, had\r\npassed acts to tax the colonies without representation, ignoring their\r\nown representative Legislatures; had imposed duties on goods imported to\r\nbe enforced by Courts which deprived the colonists of the privilege of\r\ntrial by jury; had made by Act of Parliament, without trial, the city of\r\nBoston not only responsible for tea destroyed by seventeen individuals,\r\nbut blocked up its port not only until the money was paid, but until the\r\ncity authorities should give guarantee satisfactory to the King that the\r\ntea and other revenue Acts should be enforced--a proceeding\r\nunprecedented and unparalleled in the annals of British history. Even in\r\nmore arbitrary times, when the cities of London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh\r\nwere made responsible for property lawlessly destroyed within their\r\nlimit, it was only until after trial in each case, in which those\r\ncities had an opportunity of defence, and in neither case was the trade\r\nof the city prohibited and destroyed. But the British Ministry and\r\nParliament proceeded still further by superseding the most essential\r\nprovisions of the Charter of the Province of Massachusetts, and changing\r\nits whole constitution of government--a high-handed act of arbitrary\r\ngovernment which had not been attempted by either Charles the First or\r\nCharles the Second in regard to the same colony; for when charges were\r\nbrought, in 1632, against the Massachusetts authorities, for having\r\nviolated the Charter, Charles the First appointed a commission, gave the\r\naccused a trial, which resulted in their acquittal and promised support\r\nby the King; and when they were accused again in 1634, the King did not\r\nforthwith cancel their Charter, but issued a second commission, which,\r\nhowever, never reported, in consequence of the commencement of the civil\r\nwar in England, which resulted in the death of the King. Then, in the\r\nrestoration, when charges were preferred, by parties without as well as\r\nwithin the province, against the Government of Massachusetts, King\r\nCharles the Second appointed a commission to examine into the\r\ncomplaints, and at length tested their acts by trial in the highest\r\ncourts of law, and by whose decision their first Charter was cancelled\r\nfor repeated and even habitual violations of it. But without a trial, or\r\neven commission of inquiry, the King and Parliament changed the\r\nconstitution of the province as well as extinguished the trade of its\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: When the words of Lord Chatham were reported to the King,\r\nhis Majesty was \"stung to the heart,\" and was greatly enraged,\r\ndenouncing Lord Chatham as an \"abandoned politician,\" \"the trumpet of\r\nsedition,\" and classified him with Temple and Grenville as \"void of\r\ngratitude.\" The King repelled and hated every statesman who advised him\r\nto conciliate the colonists by recognising them as having the rights of\r\nBritish subjects. He was the prompter of the most violent measures\r\nagainst them, and seemed to think that their only rights and duties were\r\nto obey whatever he might command and the Parliament declare.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: Dr. Franklin had been Postmaster-General for America.\r\nWhen he assumed the office the expenditure exceeded the receipts by\r\n£3,000 a year; under his administration the receipts gradually increased\r\nso as to become a source of revenue. The day after his advocacy of the\r\nAmerican petitions before the Privy Council, he was dismissed from\r\noffice. Referring to the manner in which American petitions and their\r\nagents were treated by the British Government, Dr. Franklin expressed\r\nhimself as follows, in a letter to the Hon. Thomas Cushing, Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives of Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n\"When I see that all petitions and complaints of grievances are so\r\nodious to Government that even the mere pipe which conveys them becomes\r\nobnoxious, I am at a loss to know how peace and union is to be\r\nmaintained or restored between the different parts of the empire.\r\nGrievances cannot be redressed unless they are known; and they cannot be\r\nknown but through complaints and petitions. If these are deemed\r\naffronts, and the messengers punished as offenders, who will henceforth\r\nsend petitions? and who will deliver them? It has been thought a\r\ndangerous thing in any State to stop up the vent of griefs. Wise\r\ngovernments have therefore generally received petitions with some\r\nindulgence even when but slightly founded. Those who think themselves\r\ninjured by their rulers are sometimes, by a mild and prudent answer,\r\nconvinced of their error. But where complaining is a crime, hope becomes\r\ndespair.\" (Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society.)\r\n\r\n(Yet the Government of Massachusetts, under the first Charter,\r\npronounced petitions a crime, and punished as criminals those who\r\npetitioned against the governmental acts which denied them the right of\r\nworship or elective franchise because they were non-Congregationalists.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: Parliamentary Register for 1775, p. 134.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n1775 CONTINUED--PARLIAMENT PROCEEDS TO PASS AN ACT TO PUNISH ALL THE NEW\r\nENGLAND COLONIES FOR SYMPATHISING WITH MASSACHUSETTS, BY RESTRICTING\r\nTHEIR TRADE TO ENGLAND AND DEPRIVING THEM OF THE NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Ministry and both Houses of Parliament do not seem to have\r\nbeen satisfied with having charged Massachusetts and its abettors with\r\nrebellion, and determined to punish the recusant province and its\r\nmetropolis accordingly, but they proceeded, during the same session,\r\neven to punish the other New England provinces for alleged sympathy with\r\nthe town of Boston and the province of Massachusetts. The very day after\r\nthe two Houses of Parliament had presented their joint address to the\r\nKing, declaring the existence of \"rebellion\" in the province of\r\nMassachusetts, abetted by many persons in the other provinces, Lord\r\nNorth introduced a Bill into the Commons to restrain the trade and\r\ncommerce of the provinces of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nand Connecticut, to Great Britain and Ireland and the British Islands in\r\nthe West Indies, and to prohibit those provinces from carrying on any\r\nfishery on the banks of Newfoundland. Lord North assigned as the reason\r\nfor this Bill that the three other New England colonies \"had aided and\r\nabetted their offending neighbours, and were so near them that the\r\nintentions of Parliament would be frustrated unless they were in like\r\nmanner comprehended in the proposed restraints.\" The Bill encountered\r\nmuch opposition in both Houses, but was passed by large majorities.\r\n\r\nShortly after passing this Bill to restrain the trade of the New England\r\ncolonies and to prohibit them the fisheries of Newfoundland, as well as\r\nfrom trading with foreign countries, intelligence reached England that\r\nthe middle and southern colonies were countenancing and encouraging the\r\nopposition of their New England brethren, and a second Bill was brought\r\ninto Parliament and passed for imposing similar restraints on the\r\ncolonies of East and West Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, and the counties on the Delaware. It is singular to note\r\nin this Bill the omission of New York, Delaware, and North Carolina. It\r\nwas probably thought that the omission of these colonies would cause\r\ndissension among the colonies; but the three exempted provinces declined\r\nthe distinction, and submitted to the restraints imposed upon the other\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nMuch was expected by Lord North and his colleagues from the General\r\nAssembly of New York, which had not endorsed the proceedings of the\r\nfirst Continental Congress, held in Philadelphia the previous September\r\nand October; but at the very time that the British Parliament was\r\npassing the Act which exempted New York from the disabilities and\r\npunishments inflicted on its neighbouring colonies, north and south, the\r\nLegislative Assembly of New York was preparing a petition and\r\nremonstrance to the British Parliament on the grievances of all the\r\ncolonies, not omitting the province of Massachusetts. This petition and\r\nremonstrance of the General Assembly of New York was substantially a\r\nUnited Empire document, and expressed the sentiments of all classes in\r\nthe colonies, except the Royal governors and some office-holders, as\r\nlate as May, 1775. The following extracts from this elaborate and\r\nably-written address will indicate its general character. The whole\r\ndocument is given in the Parliamentary Register, Vol. I., pp. 473-478,\r\nand is entitled \"The Representation and Remonstrance of the General\r\nAssembly of the Colony of New York, to the Honourable the Knights,\r\nCitizens, and Burgesses of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled.\" It\r\ncommences as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Impressed with the warmest sentiments of loyalty and affection to our\r\nmost gracious Sovereign, and zealously attached to his person, family,\r\nand government, we, his Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives\r\nof the ancient and loyal colony of New York, behold with the deepest\r\nconcern the unhappy disputes subsisting between the mother country and\r\nher colonies. Convinced that the grandeur and strength of the British\r\nempire, the protection and opulence of his Majesty's American dominions,\r\nand the happiness and welfare of both, depend essentially on a\r\nrestoration of harmony and affection between them, we feel the most\r\nardent desire to promote a cordial reconciliation with the parent state,\r\nwhich can be rendered permanent and solid only by ascertaining the line\r\nof parliamentary authority and American freedom on just, equitable, and\r\nconstitutional grounds. To effect these salutary purposes, and to\r\nrepresent the grievances under which we labour, by the innovations which\r\nhave been made in the constitutional mode of government since the close\r\nof the last war, we shall proceed with that firmness which becomes the\r\ndescendants of Englishmen and a people accustomed to the blessings of\r\nliberty, and at the same time with the deference and respect which is\r\ndue to your august Assembly to show--\r\n\r\n\"That from the year 1683 till the above-mentioned period the colony has\r\nenjoyed a Legislature consisting of three distinct branches--a Governor,\r\nCouncil, and General Assembly; under which political frame the\r\nrepresentatives of the people have uniformly exercised the right of\r\ntheir civil government and the administration of justice in the colony.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore with inexpressible grief that we have of late years\r\nseen measures adopted by the British Parliament subversive of that\r\nConstitution under which the people of this colony have always enjoyed\r\nthe same rights and privileges so highly and deservedly prized by their\r\nfellow-subjects in Great Britain--a Constitution in its infancy modelled\r\nafter that of the parent state, in its growth more nearly assimilated to\r\nit, and tacitly implied and undeniably recognised in the requisitions\r\nmade by the Crown, with the consent and approbation of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"An exemption from internal taxation, and the exclusive right of\r\nproviding for the support of our own civil government and the\r\nadministration of justice in this colony, we esteem our undoubted and\r\ninalienable rights as Englishmen; but while we claim these essential\r\nrights, it is with equal pleasure and truth we can declare, that we ever\r\nhave been and ever will be ready to bear our full proportion of aids to\r\nthe Crown for the public service, and to make provision for the\r\nnecessary purposes, in as ample and adequate a manner as the\r\ncircumstances of the colony will admit. Actuated by these sentiments,\r\nwhile we address ourselves to a British House of Commons, which has ever\r\nbeen so sensible of the rights of the people, and so tenacious of\r\npreserving them from violation, can it be a matter of surprise that we\r\nshould feel the most distressing apprehensions from the Act of the\r\nBritish Parliament declaring their right to bind the colonies in all\r\ncases whatsoever?--a principle which has been actually exercised by the\r\nstatutes made for the sole and express purpose of raising a revenue in\r\nAmerica, especially for the support of Government, and other usual and\r\nordinary services of the colonies.\r\n\r\n\"The trial by a jury of the vicinage, in causes civil and criminal\r\narising within the colony, we consider as essential to the security of\r\nour lives and liberties, and one of the main pillars of the\r\nConstitution, and therefore view with horror the construction of the\r\nstatute of the 35th of Henry the Eighth, as held up by the joint address\r\nof both Houses of Parliament in 1769, advising his Majesty to send for\r\npersons guilty of treasons and misprisions of treasons in the colony of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, in order to be tried in England; and we are equally\r\nalarmed at the late Act empowering his Majesty to send persons guilty of\r\noffences in one colony to be tried in another, or within the realm of\r\nEngland....\r\n\r\n\"We must also complain of the Act of the 7th of George the Third,\r\nchapter 59th, requiring the Legislature of this colony to make provision\r\nfor the expense of supplying troops quartered amongst us, with the\r\nnecessaries prescribed by that law; and holding up by another Act a\r\nsuspension of our legislative powers till we should have complied, as it\r\nwould have included all the effects of a tax, and implied a distrust of\r\nour readiness to contribute to the public service.\r\n\r\n\"Nor in claiming these essential rights do we entertain the most distant\r\ndesire of independence of the parent kingdom. We acknowledge the\r\nParliament of Great Britain necessarily entitled to a supreme direction\r\nand government over the whole empire, for a wise, powerful, and lasting\r\npreservation of the great bond of union and safety among all the\r\nbranches; their authority to regulate the trade of the colonies, so as\r\nto make it subservient to the interest of the mother country, and to\r\nprevent its being injurious to the other parts of his Majesty's\r\ndominions....\r\n\r\n\"Interested as we must consider ourselves in whatever may affect our\r\nsister colonies, we cannot help feeling for the distresses of our\r\nbrethren in the Massachusetts Bay, from the operation of the several\r\nActs of Parliament passed relative to that province, and of earnestly\r\nremonstrating in their behalf. At the same time, we also must express\r\nour disapprobation of the violent measures that have been pursued in\r\nsome of the colonies, which can only tend to increase our misfortunes\r\nand to prevent our obtaining redress.\r\n\r\n\"We claim but a restoration of those rights which we enjoyed by general\r\nconsent before the close of the last war; we desire no more than a\r\ncontinuation of that ancient government to which we are entitled by the\r\nprinciples of the British Constitution, and by which alone can be\r\nsecured to us the rights of Englishmen. Attached by every tie of\r\ninterest and regard to the British nation, and accustomed to behold with\r\nreverence and respect its excellent form of government, we harbour not\r\nan idea of diminishing the power and grandeur of the mother country, or\r\nlessening the lustre and dignity of Parliament. Our object is the\r\nhappiness which we are convinced can only arise from the union of both\r\ncountries. To render this union permanent and solid, we esteem it the\r\nundoubted right of the colonies to participate in that Constitution\r\nwhose direct aim is the liberty of the subject; fully trusting that your\r\nhonourable House will listen with attention to our complaints, and\r\nredress our grievances by adopting such measures as shall be found most\r\nconducive to the general welfare of the whole empire, and most likely to\r\nrestore union and harmony amongst all its different branches.\r\n\r\n\"By order of the General Assembly,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN CRUGER, _Speaker_.\r\n\r\n\"Assembly Chamber, City of New York, the 25th day of\r\nMarch, 1775.\"\r\n\r\nThis representation and remonstrance having been presented to the House\r\nof Commons, Mr. Burke moved, the 15th of May, that it be brought up. He\r\nsaid \"he had in his hand a paper of importance from the General Assembly\r\nof the Province of New York--a province which yielded to no part of his\r\nMajesty's dominions in its zeal for the prosperity and unity of the\r\nempire, and which had ever contributed as much as any, in its\r\nproportion, to the defence and wealth of the whole.\" \"They never had\r\nbefore them so fair an opportunity of putting an end to the unhappy\r\ndisputes with the colonies as at present, and he conjured them in the\r\nmost earnest manner not to let it escape, as possibly the like might\r\nnever return. He thought this application from America so very desirable\r\nto the House, that he could have made no sort of doubt of their entering\r\nheartily into his ideas, if Lord North, some days before, in opening the\r\nbudget, had not gone out of his way to make a panegyric on the last\r\nParliament, and in particular to commend as acts of lenity and mercy\r\nthose very laws which the Remonstrance considers as intolerable\r\ngrievances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord North spoke greatly in favour of New York, and said he would\r\ngladly do everything in his power to show his regard to the good\r\nbehaviour of that colony; but the honour of Parliament required that no\r\npaper should be presented to that House which tended to call in question\r\nthe unlimited rights of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fox said the right of Parliament to tax America was not simply\r\ndenied in the Remonstrance, but was coupled with the exercise of it. The\r\nexercise was the thing complained of, not the right itself. When the\r\nDeclaratory Act was passed, asserting the right in the fullest extent,\r\nthere were no tumults in America, no opposition to Government in any\r\npart of that country; but when the right came to be exercised in the\r\nmanner we have seen, the whole country was alarmed, and there was an\r\nunanimous determination to oppose it. The right simply is not regarded;\r\nit is the exercise of it that is the object of opposition. It is this\r\nexercise that has irritated and made almost desperate several of the\r\ncolonies. But the noble lord (Lord North) chooses to be consistent, and\r\nis determined to make them all alike. The only province that was\r\nmoderate, and in which England had some friends, he now treats with\r\ncontempt. What will be the consequence when the people of this moderate\r\nprovince are informed of this treatment? That representation which the\r\ncool and candid of this moderate province had framed with deliberation\r\nand caution is rejected--is not suffered to be presented--is not even to\r\nbe read by the clerk. When they hear this they will be inflamed, and\r\nhereafter be as distinguished by their violence as they have hitherto\r\nbeen by their moderation. It is the only method they can take to regain\r\nthe esteem and confidence of their brethren in the other colonies who\r\nhave been offended at their moderation. Those who refused to send\r\ndeputies to the Congress (at Philadelphia), and trusted to Parliament,\r\nwill appear ridiculous in the eyes of all America. It will be proved\r\nthat those who distrusted and defied Parliament had made a right\r\njudgment, and those who relied upon its moderation and clemency had been\r\nmistaken and duped; and the consequence of this must be, that every\r\nfriend the Ministers have in America must either abandon them, or lose\r\nall credit and means of serving them in future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Governor _Johnstone_ observed that when Mr. Wilkes had formerly\r\npresented a petition full of matter which the House did not think to\r\nenter into, they did not prevent the petition being brought up, but\r\nseparated the matter which they thought improper from that which they\r\nthought ought to be heard. The House might make use of the same\r\nselection here. Ministers have long declared they wished for a dutiful\r\napplication from one of the colonies, and now it is come they treat it\r\nwith scorn and indignity. Mr. Cornwall had said it came only from\r\ntwenty-six individuals. These twenty-six are the whole Assembly. When\r\nthe question to adopt the measures recommended by the Congress was\r\nnegatived by a majority of one only in this Assembly of twenty-six\r\nindividuals, the Ministers were in high spirits, and these individuals\r\nwere then represented as all America.\"\r\n\r\nLord North's amendment to reject the petition was adopted by a majority\r\nof 186 to 67.[357]\r\n\r\n\"After having been foiled in the House of Commons,\" says the royal\r\nhistorian, \"it now remained to be decided whether that colony's\r\nrepresentations would meet with a more gracious reception in the House\r\nof Lords. But here the difficulty was still greater than in the other\r\nHouse. The dignity of the peerage was said to be insulted by the\r\nappellation under which it had been presumed to usher those\r\nrepresentations into that Assembly. They were styled a Memorial; such a\r\ntitle was only allowable in transactions between princes and states\r\nindependent of each other, but was insufferable on the part of subjects.\r\nThe answer was that the lowest officer in the service had a right to\r\npresent a memorial, even to his Majesty, should he think himself\r\naggrieved; with much more reason might a respectable body present one to\r\nthe House of Lords. But, exclusive of the general reason that entitled\r\nso important a colony to lay such a paper before them, the particular\r\nreason of its fidelity, in spite of so many examples of defection, was\r\nalone a motive which ought to supersede all forms, and engage their most\r\nserious attention to what it had to propose.\r\n\r\n\"After sundry arguments of the same nature, the question was determined\r\nagainst hearing the Memorial by forty-five peers to twenty-five.\r\n\r\n\"When the rejection of these applications was announced to the public, a\r\ngreat part of the nation expressed the highest discontent. They now\r\nlooked forward with dejection and sorrow at the prospect of mutual\r\ndestruction that lay before them, and utterly gave up all other\r\nexpectations.\"[358]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that such a rejection of the petition of the most\r\nloyal colony in America would end the presentation of petitions on the\r\npart of the colonies to the King and Parliament, and decide them at once\r\neither to submit to the extinction of their constitutional rights as\r\nBritish subjects, or defend them by force. But though they had, both\r\nseparately and unitedly, declared from the beginning that they would\r\ndefend their rights at all hazards, they persisted in exhausting every\r\npossible means to persuade the King and Parliament to desist from such a\r\nsystem of oppression, and to restore to them those rights which they\r\nenjoyed for more than a century--down to the close of the French war in\r\n1763.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: Parliamentary Register, Vol. I., pp. 467-473.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: Dr. Andrews' History of the War with America, Spain, and\r\nHolland, Vol. I., pp. 275, 276.\r\n\r\n\"The Ministerial objections were that it was incompatible with the\r\ndignity of the House to suffer any paper to be presented that questioned\r\nits supreme authority. Particular notice was taken at the same time that\r\nthe title of Petition did not accompany this paper; it was called a\r\nRepresentation and Remonstrance, which was not the usual nor the proper\r\nmanner of application to Parliament. This singularity alone was\r\nsufficient to put a negative on its presentation.\r\n\r\n\"To this it was replied, that the times were so dangerous and critical\r\nthat words and forms were no longer deserving of attention. The question\r\nwas whether they thought the colony of New York was worthy of a hearing?\r\nNo colony had behaved with so much temperateness and discretion.\r\nNotwithstanding the tempestuousness of the times, and the general wreck\r\nof British authority, it had yet preserved a steady obedience to\r\nGovernment. While every other colony was bidding defiance to Britain,\r\nthis alone submissively applied to her for redress of grievances. Was it\r\nconsistent with policy, after losing the good-will of all the other\r\ncolonies, to drive this, through a needless and punctilious severity,\r\ninto their confederacy against this country? Could we expect, after such\r\na treatment, that this colony could withstand the arguments that would\r\nbe drawn from our superciliousness to induce it to relinquish a conduct\r\nwhich was so ill requited?\"--_Ib._, p. 274.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n1775 CONTINUED--THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months after the General Assembly of New York adopted its Memorial,\r\nand four months after its rejection by both Houses of Parliament, the\r\nsecond Continental Congress met, in the month of September, at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThis Assembly consisted of fifty-five members, chosen by twelve\r\ncolonies. The little colony of Georgia did not elect delegates, but\r\npromised to concur with the sister colonies in the effort to maintain\r\ntheir rights to the British Constitution. Many of the members of this\r\nAssembly were men of fortune and learning, and represented not only the\r\ngeneral sentiments of the colonies, but their wealth and\r\nrespectability.[359] \"The object, as stated in the credentials of the\r\ndelegates, and especially in those of the two most powerful colonies of\r\nMassachusetts and Virginia, was to obtain the redress of grievances, and\r\nto restore harmony between Great Britain and America, which, it was\r\nsaid, was desired by all good men. It was the conviction that this might\r\nbe done through a Bill of Rights, in which the limits of the powers of\r\nthe colonies and the mother country might be defined.\"[360]\r\n\r\nSome three weeks after the assembling of Congress, before the end of\r\nSeptember, a petition to the King was reported, considered, and adopted.\r\nThis petition was addressed to the King, in behalf of the colonists,\r\nbeseeching the interposition of the Royal authority and influence to\r\nprocure them relief from their afflicting fears and jealousies, excited\r\nby the measures pursued by his Ministers, and submitting to his\r\nMajesty's consideration whether it may not be expedient for him to be\r\npleased to direct some mode by which the united applications of his\r\nfaithful colonists to the Throne may be improved into a happy and\r\npermanent reconciliation; and that in the meantime measures be taken for\r\npreventing the further destruction of the lives of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects,[361] and that such statutes as more immediately distress any\r\nof his Majesty's colonies be repealed. \"Attached to your Majesty's\r\nperson, family, and government,\" concludes this address of the Congress,\r\n\"with all the devotion that principle and affection can inspire,\r\nconnected with Great Britain by the strongest ties that can unite\r\nsocieties, and deploring every event that tends in any degree to weaken\r\nthem, we solemnly assure your Majesty that we not only most ardently\r\ndesire that the former harmony between her and these colonies may be\r\nrestored, but that a concord may be established between them upon so\r\nfirm a basis as to perpetuate its blessings, uninterrupted by any future\r\ndissensions, to succeeding generations in both countries.\" This petition\r\nwas read in Parliament the 7th of December, 1775, at the request of Mr.\r\nHartley, with several other petitions for pacification; but they were\r\nall rejected by the House of Commons.[362] The answer of the King to\r\nthe respectful and loyal constitutional petition of Congress was to\r\nproclaim the petitioners \"rebels,\" and all that supported them \"abettors\r\nof treason.\"[363]\r\n\r\nThe first day of November brought to the Continental Congress this\r\nproclamation, together with the intelligence that the British army and\r\nnavy were to be largely increased, and that German mercenary soldiers\r\nfrom Hanover and Hesse had been hired, as it was found impossible to\r\nobtain soldiers in England to fight against their fellow-subjects in\r\nAmerica.[365] On the same day the intelligence was received from General\r\nWashington, in Massachusetts, of the burning of Falmouth (now\r\nPortland).[366] The simultaneous intelligence of the treatment of the\r\nsecond petition of Congress, the Royal proclamation, the increase of the\r\narmy and navy, the employment of seventeen thousand Hanoverians and\r\nHessian mercenaries to subdue America, and the burning of Falmouth,\r\nproduced a great sensation in Congress and throughout the colonies.\r\nSome of the New England members of the Congress, especially John and\r\nSamuel Adams, had long given up the idea of reconciliation with England,\r\nand had desired independence. This feeling was, however, cherished by\r\nvery few members of the Congress; but the startling intelligence caused\r\nmany members to abandon all hope of reconciliation with the mother\r\ncountry, and to regard independence as the only means of preserving\r\ntheir liberties. Yet a large majority of the Congress still refused to\r\nentertain the proposition of independence, and awaited instructions from\r\ntheir constituents as to what they should do in these novel and painful\r\ncircumstances. In the meantime the Congress adopted energetic measures\r\nfor the defence of the colonies, and the effectiveness of their union\r\nand government. In answer to applications from South Carolina and New\r\nHampshire for advice on account of the practical suspension of their\r\nlocal Government, Congress \"recommended\" each province \"to call a full\r\nand free representation of the people, and that the representatives, if\r\nthey think it necessary, establish such a form of government as in their\r\njudgment will best promote the happiness of the people, and most\r\neffectually secure peace and good-will in the province _during the\r\ncontinuance of the present dispute between Great Britain and the\r\ncolonies_\". The province of Massachusetts had refused to acknowledge any\r\nother local Government than that which had been established by the Royal\r\nCharter of William and Mary, and which had never been cancelled by any\r\nlegal proceedings; and they continued to elect their representatives,\r\nand the representatives met and appointed the Council, and acted under\r\nit, as far as possible, irrespective of General Gage and the officers of\r\nhis appointment.\r\n\r\nThe colonies were a unit as to their determination to defend by force\r\nand at all hazards their constitutional rights and liberties as British\r\nsubjects; but they were yet far from being a unit as to renunciation of\r\nall connection with England and the declaration of independence. The\r\nLegislature of Pennsylvania was in session when the news of the\r\nrejection of the second petition of Congress and the King's proclamation\r\narrived, and when fresh instructions were asked from constituents of the\r\nmembers of Congress; and even under these circumstances, Mr. Dickenson,\r\n\"The Immortal Farmer,\" whose masterly letters had done so much to\r\nenlighten the public mind of both England and America on the rights of\r\nthe colonies and the unconstitutional acts of the British Administration\r\nand Parliament, repelled the idea of separation from England. The\r\nLegislature of Pennsylvania continued to require all its members to\r\nsubscribe the old legal qualification which included the promise of\r\nallegiance to George the Third; \"so that Franklin,\" says Bancroft,\r\n\"though elected for Philadelphia, through the Irish and Presbyterians,\r\nwould never take his seat. Dickenson had been returned for the county by\r\nan almost unanimous vote.\" The Legislature, on the 4th of November,\r\nelected nine delegates to the Continental Congress. Of these, one was\r\ntoo ill to serve; of the rest, \"Franklin stood alone as the unhesitating\r\nchampion of independence; _the majority remained to the last its\r\nopponents_. On the 9th, Dickenson reported and carried the following\r\ninstructions to the Pennsylvania delegates: 'We direct that you exert\r\nyour utmost endeavours to agree upon and recommend such measures as you\r\nshall judge to afford the best prospect of obtaining redress of American\r\ngrievances, and restoring that union and harmony between Great Britain\r\nand the colonies so essential to the welfare and happiness of both\r\ncountries. Though the oppressive measures of the British Parliament and\r\nAdministration have compelled us to resist their violence by force of\r\narms, yet we strictly enjoin you, that you, in behalf of this colony,\r\ndissent from and utterly reject any propositions, should such be made,\r\nthat may cause or lead to a separation from our mother country, or a\r\nchange of the form of this government.' The influence of the measure was\r\nwide. Delaware was naturally swayed by the example of its more powerful\r\nneighbour; the party of the proprietary of Maryland took courage; in a\r\nfew weeks the Assembly of New Jersey, in like manner, held back the\r\ndelegates of that province by an equally stringent declaration.\"[367]\r\nAfter stating that the Legislature of Pennsylvania, before its\r\nadjournment, adopted rules for the volunteer battalions, and\r\nappropriated eighty thousand pounds in provincial paper money to defray\r\nthe expenses of military preparation, Mr. Bancroft adds, that \"extreme\r\ndiscontent led the more determined to expose through the press the\r\ntrimming of the Assembly; and Franklin encouraged Thomas Paine, an\r\nemigrant from England of the previous year, who was master of a\r\nsingularly lucid and attractive style, to write an appeal to the people\r\nof America in favour of independence.\"[368] \"Yet the men of that day had\r\nbeen born and educated as subjects of a king; to them the House of\r\nHanover was a symbol of religious toleration, the British Constitution\r\nanother word for the security of liberty and property under a\r\nrepresentative government. They were not yet enemies of monarchy; they\r\nhad as yet turned away from considering whether well-organized civil\r\ninstitutions could not be framed for wide territories without a king;\r\nand in the very moment of resistance they longed to escape the necessity\r\nof a revolution. Zubly, a delegate from Georgia, a Swiss by birth,\r\ndeclared in his place 'a republic to be little better than a government\r\nof devils;' shuddered at the idea of separation from Britain as fraught\r\nwith greater evils than had yet been suffered.\"[369]\r\n\r\nThe exact time when the minds of the leading men in the Colonies, and\r\nthe colonists, began to undergo a transition from the defence of their\r\nconstitutional liberties as British subjects to their security by\r\ndeclaring independence of Great Britain, seems to have been the receipt\r\nof the intelligence of the scornful rejection of the second petition of\r\nCongress, and of the King's proclamation, putting the advocates of\r\ncolonial rights out of the protection of the law, by declaring them\r\nrebels, and requiring all public officers, civil and military, to\r\napprehend them with a view to their punishment as such. Some individuals\r\nof eminence in the colonies had previously despaired of reconciliation\r\nwith England, and had regarded Independency as the only hope of\r\npreserving their liberties, but these were the exceptions: the leaders\r\nand colonists generally still hoped for reconciliation with England by\r\nhaving their liberties restored, as they were recognized and enjoyed at\r\nthe close of the French war in 1763. They had regarded the King as their\r\nFather and Friend, and laid all the blame upon his Ministers and\r\nParliament, against whose acts they appealed to the King for the\r\nprotection of their rights and liberties. But it gradually transpired,\r\nfrom year to year, that the King himself was the real prompter of these\r\noppressive acts and measures, and though long discredited,[370] yet when\r\nthe King ostentatiously announced himself as the champion of the\r\nParliament and its acts, his determination to enforce by the whole power\r\nof the realm, the absolute submission of the colonies; and when all this\r\nintelligence, so often repeated and doubted, was confirmed by the issue\r\nof the Royal proclamation, which it was known and admitted that the King\r\nhimself had urged and hastened, the most sanguine advocates and friends\r\nof reconciliation were astounded and began to despair; and the idea of\r\nindependence was now boldly advocated by the press.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Dr. Franklin said to the Earl of Chatham, \"I never heard from\r\nany person the least expression of a wish for separation.\" In October,\r\n1774, Washington wrote, \"I am well satisfied that no such thing as\r\nindependence is desired by any thinking man in America; on the contrary,\r\nthat it is the ardent wish of the warmest advocates for liberty that\r\npeace and tranquillity, on constitutional grounds, may be restored, and\r\nthe horrors of civil discord prevented.\" Jefferson stated, \"Before the\r\n19th of April, 1775 (the day of General Gage's attack on Concord, and\r\nthe Lexington affair), I never heard a whisper of a disposition to\r\nseparate from Great Britain.\" And thirty-seven days before that wanton\r\naggression of General Gage,[371] John Adams, in Boston, published:\r\n\r\n\"That there are any who pant after independence is the greatest slander\r\non the Province.\" Sparks, in a note entitled \"American Independence,\" in\r\nthe second volume of the Writings of Washington, remarks: \"It is not\r\neasy to determine at what precise date the idea of independence was\r\nfirst entertained by the principal persons in America.\" Samuel Adams,\r\nafter the events of the 19th of April, 1775, was prepared to advocate\r\nit. Members of the Provincial Congress of New Hampshire were of the same\r\nopinion. President Dwight, of Yale College (Travels in New England and\r\nNew York, Vol. I., p. 159), says: \"In the month of July, 1775, I urged\r\nin conversation with several gentlemen of great respectability, firm\r\nWhigs, and my intimate friends, the importance and even necessity of a\r\ndeclaration of independence on the part of the colonies, but found them\r\ndisposed to give me and my arguments a hostile and contemptuous, instead\r\nof a cordial reception. These gentlemen may be considered as the\r\nrepresentatives of the great body of thinking men of this country.\" In\r\nthe note of Sparks are embodied the recollections of Madison, Jay, and\r\nothers, and the contemporary statements of Franklin and Penn. They are\r\nin harmony with the statements and quotations in the text, and sustain\r\nthe judgment of Dr. Ramsay (History of South Carolina, Vol. I., p. 164),\r\nwho says: \"Till the rejection of the second petition of Congress, the\r\nreconciliation with the mother country was the unanimous wish of the\r\nAmericans generally.\"[372]\r\n\r\nWhen Washington heard of the affair of Concord and Lexington, April 19,\r\n1775, he wrote, in his own quiet residence at Mount Vernon, \"Unhappy is\r\nit to reflect that a brother's sword should be sheathed in a brother's\r\nbreast, and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are to be\r\neither drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves. Sad alternative! But,\r\ncan a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?\" Mr. Bancroft says: \"The\r\nreply to Bunker Hill from England reached Washington before the end of\r\nSeptember (1775); and the manifest determination of the Ministers to\r\npush the war by sea and land, with the utmost vigour, removed from his\r\nmind every doubt of the necessity of independence. Such also was the\r\nconclusion of Greene; and the army was impatient when any of the\r\nchaplains prayed for the King.\"[373]\r\n\r\nIt was thus that King George the Third, by his own acts, lost the\r\nconfidence and affection of his loyal subjects in America, and hastened\r\na catastrophe of which he had been repeatedly and faithfully warned, and\r\nwhich none deprecated more generally and earnestly than the leaders and\r\ninhabitants of the American colonies; but who determined, and openly\r\ndeclared their determination in every petition to the King and\r\nParliament for ten years, that, if necessary, at all hazards, they would\r\nmaintain and defend their constitutional rights as Englishmen.\r\n\r\nNow, at the close of the year 1775, and before entering upon the\r\neventful year of 1776, when the American colonies adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, let us recapitulate the events which thus\r\nbrought the mother country and her colonial offspring face to face in\r\narmed hostility.\r\n\r\n1. No loyalty and affection could be more cordial than that of the\r\nAmerican colonies to England at the conquest of Canada from the French,\r\nand the peace of Paris between Great Britain and France in 1763. Even\r\nthe ancient and traditional disaffection of Massachusetts to England had\r\ndissolved into feelings of gratitude and respect and avowed loyalty.\r\nIndeed, loyalty and attachment to England, and pride in the British\r\nConstitution, was the universal feeling of the American colonies at the\r\nclose of the war which secured North America to England, and for the\r\ntriumphant termination of which the American colonies had raised and\r\nequipped no less than twenty-five thousand men, without whose services\r\nthe war could not have been accomplished.\r\n\r\n2. The first five years of the war with France in America had been\r\ndisastrous to Great Britain and the colonies, under a corrupt English\r\nAdministration and incompetent generals; but after the accession of the\r\nEarl of Chatham to the Premiership the tide of war in America turned in\r\nfavour of Great Britain by the appointment of able generals--Amherst and\r\nWolfe--and Admiral Boscawen and others, and by adopting constitutional\r\nmethods to develop the resources of the colonies for the war; and in two\r\nyears the French power was crushed and ceased to exist in America. When\r\nthe Crown, through its Prime Minister, made requisition to the Colonial\r\nLegislatures for money and men, as was the usage in England, the\r\nColonial Legislatures responded by granting large sums of money, and\r\nsending into the field more than twenty thousand soldiers, who, by their\r\nskill, courage, and knowledge of the country, and its modes of travel\r\nand warfare, constituted the pioneers, skirmishers, and often the\r\nstrongest arm of the British army, and largely contributed in every\r\ninstance to its most splendid victories. Their loyalty, bravery, and\r\npatriotism extracted grateful acknowledgments in both Houses of\r\nParliament, and even from the Throne; while the colonies as cordially\r\nacknowledged the essential and successful assistance of the mother\r\ncountry. At no period of colonial history was there so deep-felt,\r\nenthusiastic loyalty to the British Constitution and British connection\r\nas at the close of the war between France and England in 1763. But in\r\nthe meantime George the Third, after his accession to the throne in\r\n1760, determined not only to _reign over_ but to _rule_ his kingdom,\r\nboth at home and abroad. He ignored party government or control in\r\nParliament; he resolved to be his own Prime Minister--in other words, to\r\nbe despotic; he dismissed the able and patriotic statesmen who had wiped\r\noff the disgrace inflicted on British arms and prestige during the five\r\nyears of the French and Indian war in the American colonies, and had\r\ngiven America to England, and called men one after another to succeed\r\nthem, who, though in some instances they were men of ability, and in one\r\nor two instances were men of amiable and Christian character, were upon\r\nthe whole the most unscrupulous and corrupt statesmen that ever stood at\r\nthe head of public affairs in England, and the two Parliaments elected\r\nunder their auspices were the most venal ever known in British history.\r\nThe King regarded as a personal enemy any member of Parliament who\r\nopposed his policy, and hated any Minister of State (and dismissed him\r\nas soon as possible) who offered advice to, instead of receiving it\r\nfrom, his Royal master and implicitly obeying it; and the Ministers whom\r\nhe selected were too subservient to the despotism and caprices of the\r\nRoyal will, at the frequent sacrifice of their own convictions and the\r\nbest interests of the empire.\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred years the colonies had provided for and\r\ncontrolled their own civil, judicial, and military administration of\r\ngovernment; and when the King required special appropriations of money\r\nand raising of men during the Seven Years' War, requisitions were made\r\nby his Ministers in his name, through the Governors, to the several\r\nProvincial Legislatures, which responded with a liberality and\r\npatriotism that excited surprise in England at the extent of their\r\nresources in both money and men. But this very development of colonial\r\npower excited jealousy and apprehensions in England, instead of sympathy\r\nand respect; and within a twelvemonth after the treaty of Paris, in\r\n1763, the King and his Ministers determined to discourage and crush all\r\nmilitary spirit and organization in the colonies, to denude the Colonial\r\nLegislatures of all the attributes of British constitutional free\r\ngovernment, by the British Government not only appointing the Governors\r\nof the colonies, but by appointing the members of one branch of the\r\nLegislature, by appointing Judges as well as other public officers to\r\nhold office during the pleasure of the Crown, and fixing and paying\r\ntheir salaries out of moneys paid by colonists, but levied not by the\r\nColonial Legislatures, but by Acts of the British Parliament, contrary\r\nto the usage of more than a century; and under the pretext of\r\n_defending_ the colonies, but really for the purpose of ruling them;\r\nproposing an army of 20 regiments of 500 men each, to be raised and\r\nofficered in England, from the penniless and often worse than penniless\r\nof the scions and relatives of Ministers and members of Parliament, and\r\nbilleted upon the colonies at the estimated expense of £100,000 sterling\r\na year, to be paid by the colonies out of the proceeds of the Stamp and\r\nother Acts of Parliament passed for the purpose of raising a revenue in\r\nthe colonies for the support of its civil and military government.\r\n\r\nNo government is more odious and oppressive than that which has the\r\nmockery of the form of free government without its powers or attributes.\r\nAn individual despot may be reached, terrified, or persuaded, but a\r\ndespotic oligarchy has no restraint of individual responsibility, and is\r\nas intangible in its individuality as it is grasping and heartless in\r\nits acts and policy. For governors, all executive officers, judges, and\r\nlegislative councillors appointed from England, together with military\r\nofficers, 20 regiments all raised in England, the military commanders\r\ntaking precedence of the local civil authorities, all irresponsible to\r\nthe colonists, yet paid by them out of taxes imposed upon them without\r\ntheir consent, is the worst and most mercenary despotism that can be\r\nconceived. The colonists could indeed continue to elect representatives\r\nto one branch of their Legislatures; but the Houses of Assembly thus\r\nelected were powerless to protect the liberties or properties of their\r\nconstituents, subject to abuse and dissolution in case of their\r\nremonstrating against unconstitutional acts of tyranny or advocating\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nSuch was the system passionately insisted upon by King George the Third\r\nto establish his absolute authority over his colonial subjects in\r\nAmerica, and such were the methods devised by his venal Ministers and\r\nParliament to provide places and emoluments for their sons, relatives,\r\nand dependents, at the expense of the colonists, to say nothing of the\r\nconsequences to the virtue of colonial families from mercenary public\r\nofficers and an immoral soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe American colonies merited other treatment than that which they\r\nreceived at the hands of the King and Parliament from 1763 to 1776; and\r\nthey would have been unworthy of the name of Englishmen, and of the\r\nrespect of mankind, had they yielded an iota of the constitutional\r\nrights of British subjects, for which they so lawfully and manfully\r\ncontended. What the old colonies contended for during that eventful\r\nperiod was substantially the same as that which has been demanded and\r\nobtained during the present century by the colonies of the Canadian\r\nDominion, under the names of \"local self-government\" or \"responsible\r\ngovernment,\" and which is now so fully enjoyed by them. Had Queen\r\nVictoria reigned in England instead of George the Third, there would\r\nhave been no Declaration of Independence, no civil war in America, but\r\nthe thirteen American provinces would have remained as affectionately\r\nunited to the mother country, and as free as are the provinces of the\r\nCanadian Dominion at this day.\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third seems to me to have been, before and during the\r\nAmerican Revolution, the worst Sovereign for the colonies that ever\r\noccupied the throne of England; but after and since that revolution he\r\nwas the best of Sovereigns for the remaining British colonies of North\r\nAmerica. He learned lessons during that revolution which essentially\r\nchanged his character as the ruler of colonies, though I am not aware\r\nthat he ever formally confessed the change through which he had passed.\r\nIt is therefore quite reconcilable that he should be regarded by the old\r\nAmerican colonies, now the United States, as a tyrant, while his name is\r\nrevered and loved by the colonists of the Canadian Dominion as the\r\nFather of his people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: \"Each of the three divisions by which the colonies were\r\nusually designated--the New England, the Middle, and the Southern\r\nColonies--had on the floor of Congress men of a positive character. _New\r\nEngland_ presented in John Sullivan, vigour; in Roger Sherman, sterling\r\nsense and integrity; in Thomas Cushing, commercial knowledge; in John\r\nAdams (afterwards President of the United States), large capacity for\r\npublic affairs; in Samuel Adams (no relation to John Adams), a great\r\ncharacter with influence and power to organize. The _Middle_ Colonies\r\npresented in Philip Livingston, the merchant prince of enterprise and\r\nliberality; in John Jay, rare public virtue, juridical learning, and\r\nclassic taste; in William Livingston, progressive ideas tempered by\r\nconservatism; in John Dickenson, \"The Immortal Farmer,\" erudition and\r\nliterary ability; in Cæsar Rodney and Thomas McKean, working power; in\r\nJames Duane, timid Whigism, halting, but keeping true to the cause; in\r\nJoseph Galloway, downright Toryism, seeking control, and at length going\r\nto the enemy. The _Southern_ Colonies presented in Thomas Johnson, the\r\ngrasp of a statesman; in Samuel Chase, activity and boldness; in the\r\nRutledges, wealth and accomplishment; in Christopher Gadsden, the\r\ngenuine American; and in the Virginia delegation--an illustrious\r\ngroup--in Richard Bland, wisdom; in Edmund Pendleton, practical talent;\r\nin Peyton Randolph, experience in legislation; in Richard Henry Lee,\r\nstatesmanship in union with high culture; in Patrick Henry, genius and\r\neloquence; in Washington, justice and patriotism. 'If,' said Patrick\r\nHenry, 'you speak of solid information and sound judgment, Washington\r\nunquestionably is the greatest man of them all.' Those others who might\r\nbe named were chosen on account of their fitness for the duties which\r\nthe cause required. Many had independent fortunes. They constituted a\r\nnoble representation of the ability, culture, political intelligence,\r\nand wisdom of twelve of the colonies.\" (Frothingham's Rise of the\r\nRepublic of the Twelve States, pp. 360, 361.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: _Ib._, pp. 363, 364.\r\n\r\nAfter preliminary proceedings, Congress decided to appoint a Committee\r\nto state the rights of the colonies, the instances in which those rights\r\nhad been violated, and the most proper means to obtain their\r\nrestoration; and another Committee to examine and report upon the\r\nstatutes affecting the trade and manufactures of the colonies. On the\r\nsame day, Samuel Adams, in answer to the objection to opening the\r\nsession with prayer, grounded on the diversity of religious sentiment\r\namong the members, said he could hear prayer from any man of piety and\r\nvirtue, who was a friend of the country, and moved that Mr. Duché, an\r\nEpiscopalian, might be desired to read prayers for the Congress the\r\nfollowing morning. The motion prevailed. \"The Congress sat with closed\r\ndoors. Nothing transpired of their proceedings except their organization\r\nand the rule of voting (each province having an equal vote).

'There\r\nis reason,' so ran its words, 'to apprehend that such rebellion hath\r\nbeen much promoted and encouraged by the traitorous correspondence,\r\ncounsels, and comfort of divers wicked and desperate persons within our\r\nrealm.' Not only all the officers, civil and military, but all the\r\nsubjects of the realm were therefore called upon to disclose all\r\ntraitorous conspiracies, and to transmit to one of the Secretaries of\r\nState 'full information of all persons who should be found carrying on\r\ncorrespondence with, or in any manner or degree aiding or abetting the\r\npersons now in open arms and rebellion against the Government within any\r\nof the colonies in North America, in order to bring to condign\r\npunishment the authors, perpetrators, and abettors of such traitorous\r\ndesigns.'\r\n\r\n\"The proclamation, aimed at Chatham, Camden, Barré, and their friends,\r\nand the boldest of the Rockingham party, even more than against the\r\nAmericans, was read, but not with the customary ceremonies, at the Royal\r\nExchange, where it was received with a general hiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"The irrevocable publication having been made, Penn and Arthur Lee were\r\n'permitted' on the 1st of September to present the original of the\r\nAmerican petition to Lord Dartmouth, who promised to deliver it to the\r\nKing; but on their pressing for an answer, 'they were informed that as\r\nit was not received on the throne, no answer would be given.' Lee\r\nexpressed sorrow at the refusal, which would occasion so much bloodshed;\r\nand the deluded Secretary answered: 'If I thought it would be the cause\r\nof shedding one drop of blood, I should never have concurred in it.\"\r\n(Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VIII., Chap, xlix., pp.\r\n132, 133.)\r\n\r\nYet \"on the 23rd of August Lord Dartmouth wrote to General Howe, who\r\n(Aug. 2, 1775) superseded General Gage as the Commander of the British\r\narmy, that there was 'no room left for any other consideration but that\r\nof proceeding against the twelve associated colonies in all respects\r\nwith the utmost rigour, as the open and avowed enemies of the State.'\"\r\n(Frothingham's Rise of the American Republic, p. 446.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: \"In the meantime (beginning of October) Richard Penn\r\nhastened to England with the second petition. The King was now\r\ncontinually occupied with American affairs. He directed that General\r\nGage should be ordered 'instantly to come' over, on account of the\r\nbattle of Bunker Hill; thought Admiral Graves ought to be recalled from\r\nBoston 'for doing nothing,' and completed the arrangements for the\r\nemployment of Hanoverians in America. Impatient at the delay of the\r\nCabinet in acting upon the proclamation agreed upon, he put this in\r\ntrain by ordering one to be framed and submitted, August 18th, to Lord\r\nNorth, and fixed the day for its promulgation. He was confirmed in his\r\nextreme views by General Haldimand, fresh from America, who reported\r\nthat 'nothing but force could bring the colonies to reason,' and that it\r\nwould be dangerous to give ear to any proposition they might submit. The\r\nKing was convinced that it would be better 'totally to abandon the\r\ncolonies' than 'to admit a single shadow' of their doctrines [364]. Five\r\ndays after penning these words, he issued (August 23rd) a proclamation\r\nfor suppressing rebellion and sedition.\" (The purpose of this fatal\r\nproclamation is given in the sub-note.)\r\n\r\nThis proclamation, unlike Lord North's plan, ignored the colonies as\r\npolitical unities. It is levelled against individuals in rebellion, and\r\nall within the realm who should aid them. (Frothingham's Rise of the\r\nAmerican Republic, pp. 444-446. Donne's Correspondence of Geo. III.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: A private letter by Captain Collins, lately arrived from\r\nLondon, says that \"on the 19th of August General Haldimand was closeted\r\nwith his Majesty two hours, giving him a state of the American colonies;\r\nand that in the course of the conversation his Majesty expressed his\r\nresolution in these memorable words: 'I am unalterably determined, at\r\nevery hazard, and at the risk of every consequence, to compel the\r\ncolonies to absolute submission.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: \"In the autumn of this year (1775), General Gage repaired\r\nto England, and the command of the British army devolved on Sir William\r\nHowe. The offer of this command had been first made to General\r\nOglethorpe, his senior officer, who agreed to accept the appointment on\r\nthe condition that the Ministry would authorize him to assure the\r\ncolonies that justice should be done to them. This veteran and patriotic\r\nGeneral declared at the same time that he knew the people of America\r\nwell; that they never would be subdued by arms, but that their obedience\r\nwould be ever secured by doing them justice.\" (Holmes' Annals, Vol. II.,\r\np. 235.)\r\n\r\n\"The Earl of Effingham, who in his youth had been prompted by military\r\ngenius to enter the army, and had lately served as a volunteer in the\r\nwar between Russia and Turkey, finding that his regiment was intended\r\nfor America, renounced the profession which he loved, as the only means\r\nof escaping the obligation of fighting against the cause of freedom.\r\nThis resignation gave offence to the Court, and was a severe rebuke to\r\nthe officers who did not share his scruple; but at London the Common\r\nHall, in June, thanked him publicly as 'a true Englishman;' and the\r\nguild of merchants in Dublin addressed him in the strongest terms of\r\napprobation.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VII., Chap,\r\nxxxiii. pp. 343, 344.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: \"In compliance with a resolve of the Provincial Congress\r\nto prevent Tories from conveying out their effects, the inhabitants of\r\nFalmouth, in the north-eastern part of Massachusetts, had obstructed the\r\nloading of a mast ship. The destruction of the town was determined on as\r\na vindictive punishment. Captain Mowat, detached for that purpose with\r\narmed vessels by Admiral Graves, arrived off the place on the evening of\r\nthe 17th of October. He gave notice to the inhabitants that he would\r\ngive them two hours 'to remove the human species,' at the end of which\r\ntime a red pendant would be hoisted at the maintop-gallant mast-head;\r\nand that on the least resistance, he should be freed from all humanity\r\ndictated by his orders or his inclination. Upon being inquired of by\r\nthree gentlemen who went on board his ship for that purpose respecting\r\nthe reason of this extraordinary summons, he replied that he had orders\r\nto set on fire all the seaport towns from Boston to Halifax, and that he\r\nsupposed New York was already in ashes. He could dispense with his\r\norders, he said, on no terms but the compliance of the inhabitants to\r\ndeliver up their arms and ammunition, and their sending on board a\r\nsupply of provisions, four carriage guns, and the same number of the\r\nprincipal persons in the town as hostages; that they should engage not\r\nto unite with their country in any opposition to Britain; and he assured\r\nthem that on a refusal of these conditions he would lay their town in\r\nashes within three hours. Unprepared for the attack, the inhabitants by\r\nentreaty obtained the suspension of an answer until morning, and\r\nemployed this interval in removing their families and effects.\r\nConsidering opposition as unavailing, they made no resistance. The next\r\nday, Captain Mowat commenced a furious cannonade and bombardment; and a\r\ngreat number of people standing on the heights were spectators of the\r\nconflagration, which reduced many of them to penury and despair; 139\r\ndwelling-houses and 278 stores were burnt. Other seaports were\r\nthreatened with conflagration, but escaped; Newport, on Rhode Island,\r\nwas compelled to stipulate for a weekly supply, to avert it.\" (Holmes'\r\nAnnals, Vol. II., pp. 219, 220.)\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft's account of this transaction is as follows: \"In the\r\nprevious May, Mowat, a naval officer, had been held prisoner for a few\r\nhours at Falmouth, now Portland; and we have seen Linzee, in a sloop of\r\nwar, driven with loss from Gloucester. It was one of the last acts of\r\nGage to plan with the Admiral how to wreak vengeance on the inhabitants\r\nof both those ports. The design against Gloucester was never carried\r\nout; but Mowat, in a ship of sixteen guns, attended by three other\r\nvessels, went up the harbour of Portland, and after a short parley, at\r\nhalf-past nine on the morning of the 16th of October, he began to fire\r\nupon the town. In five minutes several houses were in a blaze; parties\r\nof marines had landed, to spread the conflagration by hand. All\r\nsea-going vessels were burned except two, which were carried away. The\r\ncannonade was kept up till after dark. St. Paul's Church, the public\r\nbuildings, and about one hundred and thirty dwelling-houses,\r\nthree-fourths of the whole, were burned down; those that remained\r\nstanding were shattered by balls and shells. By the English account the\r\ndestruction was still greater. At the opening of a severe winter, the\r\ninhabitants were turned adrift in poverty and misery. The wrath of\r\nWashington was justly kindled as he heard of these 'savage cruelties,'\r\nthis new 'exertion of despotic barbarity.'\" (History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. VIII., Chap. xlvii., p. 113.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: Bancroft's History United States, Vol. VIII., Chap.\r\nxlix., pp. 138, 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: In this appeal of Paine's, _monarchy_ was for the first\r\ntime attacked in America, except by the rulers of the Massachusetts\r\ncolony, under the first Charter. Some of Paine's words were, that \"In\r\nthe early ages of the world, mankind were equals in the order of\r\ncreation; the heathen introduced the government of kings, which the will\r\nof the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly\r\ndisapproved. To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary\r\nsuccession; and as the first is a lessening of ourselves, so the second\r\nmight put posterity under the government of a rogue or a fool. Nature\r\ndisapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into\r\nridicule. England since the Conquest hath known some few good monarchs,\r\nbut groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones.\" \"In short,\r\nmonarchy and succession have laid not England only, but the world, in\r\nblood and ashes.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VIII.,\r\nChap. xlix., pp. 236, 237.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: But though Mr. Dickenson had done more than any other man\r\nin America to vindicate colonial rights and expose the unconstitutional\r\ncharacter of the acts of the British Ministry and Parliament, he was\r\nopposed to a declaration of independence, like a majority of the\r\ncolonists; yet he advocated resistance by force against submission to\r\nthe Boston Port Bill, and the suspension of the Massachusetts Charter,\r\nand both without a trial, as in similar cases even under the despotic\r\nreigns of Charles the First and Second. Mr. Bancroft blames Mr.\r\nDickenson severely for the instructions of the Pennsylvania Legislature\r\nto its nine delegates in the Continental Congress in October, 1775; but,\r\nwriting under the date of the previous May, Mr. Bancroft says: \"Now that\r\nthe Charter of Massachusetts had been impaired, Dickenson did not ask\r\nmerely relief from parliamentary taxation; he required security against\r\nthe encroachments of Parliament on charters and laws. The distinctness\r\nwith which he spoke satisfied Samuel Adams himself, who has left on\r\nrecord that the Farmer was a thorough Bostonian.\" (History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. VII., Chap. xxxvi., p. 377.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: As late as May, 1775, after the bloody affair of Concord\r\nand Lexington, Mr. Bancroft remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The delegates of New England, especially those from Massachusetts,\r\ncould bring no remedy to the prevailing indecision (in the Continental\r\nCongress), for they suffered from insinuations that they represented a\r\npeople who were republican in their principles of government and\r\nfanatics in religion, and they wisely avoided the appearance of\r\nimportunity or excess in their demands.\r\n\r\n\"As the delegates from South Carolina declined the responsibility of a\r\ndecision which would have implied an abandonment of every hope of peace,\r\nthere could be no efficient opposition to the policy of _again seeking\r\nthe restoration of American liberty through the mediation of the King_.\r\nThis plan had the great advantage over the suggestion of an immediate\r\nseparation from Britain, that it could be boldly promulgated, and was\r\n_in harmony with the general wish; for the people of the continent_,\r\ntaken collectively, _had not as yet ceased to cling to their old\r\nrelations with their parent land_; and so far from scheming\r\nindependence, now that independence was become inevitable, they\r\npostponed the irrevocable decree and still longed that the necessity for\r\nit might pass by.\" (History of the United States, Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nxxxvi, pp. 376, 377.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: Lord Dartmouth (the Secretary of State for the Colonies)\r\nsaid: \"The attempts of General Gage at Concord are fatal.

Many people in England were\r\nfrom that moment convinced that the Americans could not be reduced, and\r\nthat England must concede their independence. The British force, if\r\ndrawn together, could occupy but a few insulated points, while all the\r\nrest would be free; if distributed, would be continually harassed and\r\ndestroyed in detail.\r\n\r\n\"These views were frequently brought before Lord North.

The ground of this assumption of absolute power\r\nover the colonies had no sanction in the British Constitution, much less\r\nin the history of the colonies; it was a simple declaration or\r\ndeclaratory Bill by the Parliament itself, in 1764, of its right to bind\r\nthe colonies in all cases whatsoever, and no more a part of the British\r\nConstitution than any declaration of Parliament in the previous century\r\nof its authority over the monarchy and the constitution and existence of\r\nthe House of Lords. Assuming and declaring an authority over the\r\nAmerican colonies which Parliament had never before, and which it has\r\nnever since exercised, and which no statesman or political writer of\r\nrepute at this day regards as constitutional, Parliament proceeded to\r\ntax the colonies without their consent, to suspend the legislative\r\npowers of the New York Legislature, to close the port of Boston, to\r\nannul and change all that was free in the Charter Government of\r\nMassachusetts, to forbid the New England colonies the fisheries of\r\nNewfoundland, and afterwards to prohibit to all the colonies commerce\r\nwith each other and with foreign countries; to denounce, as in the Royal\r\nSpeech to Parliament of the previous October, as \"rebellion,\"\r\nremonstrances against and opposition to these arbitrary and cruel\r\nenactments; to appeal to Holland and Russia (but in vain) for the aid\r\nof foreign soldiers, and to hire of German blood-trading princes\r\nseventeen thousand mercenary soldiers to butcher British subjects in the\r\ncolonies, even to liberate slaves for the murder of their masters, and\r\nto employ savage Indians to slaughter men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nAll this was done by the King and his servants against the colonies\r\nbefore the close of the year 1775, while they still disclaimed any\r\ndesign or desire for independence, and asked for nothing more than they\r\nenjoyed in 1763, after they had given the noblest proof of liberality\r\nand courage, to establish and maintain British supremacy in America\r\nduring the seven years' war between England and France, and enjoyed much\r\nless of that local self-government, immunity, and privilege which every\r\ninhabitant of the Canadian Dominion enjoys at this day.\r\n\r\nDuring that French war, and for a hundred years before, the colonists\r\nhad provided fortresses, artillery, arms, and ammunition for their own\r\ndefence; they were practised marksmen, far superior to the regular\r\nsoldiery of the British army, with the character and usages of which\r\nthey had become familiar. They offered to provide for their own defence\r\nas well as for the support of their civil government, both of which the\r\nBritish Government requires of the provinces of the Canadian Dominion,\r\nbut both of which were denied to the old provinces of America, after the\r\nclose of the seven years' war with France. The King and his Ministers\r\nnot only opposed the colonies providing for their own defence, but\r\nordered the seizure of their magazines, cannon, and arms. General Gage\r\ncommenced this kind of provocation and attack upon the colonists and\r\ntheir property; seized the arms of the inhabitants of Boston; spiked\r\ntheir cannon at night on Fort Hill; seized by night, also, 13 tons of\r\ncolonial powder stored at Charleston; sent by night an expedition of\r\neight hundred troops, twenty miles to Concord, to seize military\r\nprovisions, but they were driven back to Lexington with the loss of 65\r\nkilled and 180 wounded, and on the part of the colonists 50 killed and\r\n34 wounded. This was the commencement of a bloody revolution, and was\r\nsoon followed by the battle of Bunker's Hill, in which, \"on the part of\r\nthe British,\" says Holmes, \"about 3,000 men were engaged in this action;\r\nand their killed and wounded amounted to 1,054. The number of Americans\r\nin this engagement was 1,500; and their killed, wounded, and missing\r\namounted to 453.\"[374]\r\n\r\nIn each of these conflicts the attack was made and the first shot was\r\nfired on the part of the British troops. Of this, abundant evidence was\r\nforthwith collected and sent to England. It was carefully inculcated\r\nthat in no instance should the colonists attack or fire the first shot\r\nupon the British troops; that in all cases they should act upon the\r\ndefensive, as their cause was the defence of their rights and property;\r\nbut when attacked, they retaliated with a courage, skill, and deadly\r\neffect that astonished their assailants, and completely refuted the\r\nstatements diligently made in England and circulated in the army, that\r\nthe colonists had no military qualities and would never face British\r\ntroops.[375]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that General Gage thus commenced war upon the\r\npeople of Massachusetts, who so nobly responded in defence of their\r\nconstitutional rights, Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, committed\r\nsimilar outrages upon the traditionally loyal Virginians, who, as Mr.\r\nBancroft says, \"were accustomed to associate all ideas of security in\r\ntheir political rights with the dynasty of Hanover, and had never, even\r\nin thought, desired to renounce their allegiance. They loved to consider\r\nthemselves an integral part of the British empire. The distant life of\r\nlanded proprietors, in solitary mansion-houses, favoured independence of\r\nthought; but it also generated an aristocracy, which differed widely\r\nfrom the simplicity and equality of New England. Educated in the\r\nAnglican Church, no religious zeal had imbued them with a fixed hatred\r\nof kingly power; no deep-seated antipathy to a distinction of ranks, no\r\ntheoretic zeal for the introduction of a republic, no speculative\r\nfanaticism drove them to a restless love of change. They had, on the\r\ncontrary, the greatest aversion to a revolution, and abhorred the\r\ndangerous experiment of changing their form of government without some\r\nabsolute necessity.\"[376]\r\n\r\nBut the Virginians, like all true loyalists, were \"loyal to the people's\r\npart of the Constitution as well as to that which pertains to the\r\nSovereign.\"[377] To intimidate them, Dunmore issued proclamations, and\r\nthreatened freeing the slaves against their masters. On the night of the\r\n20th of April he sent a body of marines, in the night, to carry off a\r\nquantity of gunpowder belonging to the colony, and stored in its\r\nmagazine at Williamsburg. As soon as this arbitrary seizure of the\r\ncolony's property became known, drums sounded alarm throughout the city\r\nof Williamsburg, the volunteer company rallied under arms, and the\r\ninhabitants assembled for consultation, and at their request the Mayor\r\nand Corporation waited upon the Governor and asked him his motives for\r\ncarrying off their powder privately \"by an armed force, particularly at\r\na time when they were apprehensive of an insurrection among their\r\nslaves;\" and they demanded that the powder should be forthwith restored.\r\n\r\nLord Dunmore first answered evasively; but learning that the citizens\r\nhad assembled under arms, he raged and threatened. He said: \"The whole\r\ncountry can easily be made a solitude; and by the living God, if any\r\ninsult is offered to me, or to those who have obeyed my orders, I will\r\ndeclare freedom to the slaves, and lay the town in ashes.\"[378]\r\n\r\nLord Dunmore at the same time wrote to the English Secretary of State:\r\n\"With a small body of troops and arms, I could raise such a force among\r\n_Indians, Negroes_, and other persons, as would soon reduce the\r\nrefractory people of this colony to obedience.\"\r\n\r\nYet, after all his boasting and threats, the value of the powder thus\r\nunlawfully seized was restored to the colony. Lord Dunmore, agitated\r\nwith fears, as most tyrants are, left the Government House from fear of\r\nthe people excited by his own conduct towards them, and went on board of\r\nthe man-of-war ship _Tower_, at York (about 12 miles from Williamsburg,\r\nthe capital of the Province), thus leaving the colony in the absolute\r\npossession of its own inhabitants, giving as a reason for his flight,\r\nhis apprehension of \"falling a sacrifice to the daringness and\r\natrociousness, the blind and unmeasurable fury of great numbers of the\r\npeople;\" and the assurance of the very people whom he feared as to his\r\npersonal safety and that of his family, and the repeated entreaties of\r\nthe Legislative Assembly that he would return to land, with assurance\r\nof perfect safety from injury or insult, could not prevail upon Lord\r\nDunmore to return to the Government House, or prevent him from\r\nattempting to govern the ancient Dominion of Virginia from ships of war.\r\nHe seized a private printing press, with two of its printers, at the\r\ntown of Norfolk, and was thus enabled to issue his proclamations and\r\nother papers against the inhabitants whom he had so grossly insulted and\r\ninjured.[379]\r\n\r\n\"In October\" (1775), says Bancroft, \"Dunmore repeatedly landed\r\ndetachments to seize arms wherever he could find them. Thus far Virginia\r\nhad not resisted the British by force. The war began in that colony with\r\nthe defence of Hampton, a small village at the end of the isthmus\r\nbetween York and James rivers. An armed sloop had been driven on its\r\nshore in a very violent gale; its people took out of her six swivels and\r\nother stores, made some of her men prisoners, and then set her on fire.\r\nDunmore blockaded the port; they called to their assistance a company of\r\n\"Shirtmen,\" as the British called the Virginia regulars, from the\r\nhunting shirt which was their uniform, and another company of minute\r\nmen, besides a body of militia.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 26th Dunmore sent some of the tenders close into Hampton Roads\r\nto destroy the town. The guard marched out to repel them, and the moment\r\nthey came within gunshot, George Nicholas, who commanded the Virginians,\r\nfired his musket at one of the tenders; it was the first gun fired in\r\nVirginia against the British. His example was followed by his party.\r\nRetarded by boats which had been sunk across the Channel, the British on\r\nthat day vainly attempted to land. The following night the Culpepper\r\nriflemen were despatched to the aid of Hampton; and William Woodford,\r\nColonel of the 2nd Regiment of Virginia, was sent by the Committee of\r\nSafety from Williamsburg to take the direction. The next day the\r\nBritish, having cut their way through the sunken boats, renewed the\r\nattack; but the riflemen poured upon them a heavy fire, killing a few\r\nand wounding more. One of the tenders was taken, with its armament and\r\nseven seamen; the rest were with difficulty towed out of the creek. The\r\nVirginians lost not a man. This was the first battle of the revolution\r\nin the ancient Dominion, and its honours belonged to the\r\nVirginians.\"[380]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this failure of Lord Dunmore to burn the town of\r\nHampton, he proclaimed martial law and freedom to the slaves. The\r\nEnglish Annual Register states that, \"In consequence of the repulse (at\r\nHampton) a proclamation was issued (Nov. 7th) by the Governor, dated on\r\nboard the ship _William_, off Norfolk, declaring, that as the civil law\r\nwas at present insufficient to prevent and punish treason and traitors,\r\nmartial law should take place, and be executed throughout the colony;\r\nand requiring all persons capable of bearing arms to repair to his\r\nMajesty's standard, or to be considered as traitors.\" He also declared\r\nall indentured servants, negroes, and others, appertaining to rebels,\r\nwho were able and willing to bear arms, and who joined his Majesty's\r\nforces, to be free.\r\n\r\n\"The measure for emancipating the negroes,\" continues the Annual\r\nRegister, \"excited less surprise, and probably had less effect, from its\r\nbeing so long threatened and apprehended, than if it had been more\r\nimmediate and unexpected. It was, however, received with the greatest\r\nhorror in all the colonies, and has been severely condemned elsewhere,\r\nas tending to loosen the bands of society, to destroy domestic security,\r\nand encourage the most barbarous of mankind to the commission of the\r\nmost horrible crimes and the most inhuman cruelties; that it was\r\nconfounding the innocent with the guilty, and exposing those who were\r\nthe best of friends to the Government, to the same loss of property,\r\ndanger, and destruction with the most incorrigible rebels.\"[381]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed in Lord Dunmore's proclamation, as also in the\r\nEnglish Register, and I may add in General Stedman's History of the\r\nAmerican War, and in other histories of those times, the terms \"rebels,\"\r\n\"treason,\" and \"traitors\" are applied to those who, at that time, as in\r\nall previous years, disclaimed all desire of separation from England,\r\nand only claimed those constitutional rights of Englishmen to which they\r\nwere as lawfully entitled as the King was to his Crown, and very much\r\nmore so than Lord Dunmore was entitled to the authority which he was\r\nthen exercising; for he had been invested with authority to rule\r\naccording to the Constitution of the colony, but he had set aside the\r\nLegislature of the colony, which had as much right to its opinions and\r\nthe expression of them as he had to his; he had abandoned the legal seat\r\nof government, and taken up his residence on board a man-of-war, and\r\nemployed his time and strength in issuing proclamations against people\r\nto whom he had been sent to govern as the representative of a\r\n_constitutional_ sovereign, and made raids upon their coasts, and burned\r\ntheir towns. In truth, Lord Dunmore and his abettors were the real\r\n\"rebels\" and \"traitors,\" who were committing \"treason\" against the\r\nconstitutional rights and liberties of their fellow-subjects, while the\r\nobjects of their hostility were the real loyalists to the Constitution,\r\nwhich gave to the humblest subject his rights as well as to the\r\nSovereign his prerogatives.\r\n\r\nLord Dunmore, from his ship of war, had no right to rule the rich and\r\nmost extensive colony in America. He had abandoned his appointed seat of\r\ngovernment, and he became the ravager of the coasts and the destroyer of\r\nthe seaport towns of the ancient dominion. This state of things could\r\nnot long continue. Lord Dunmore could not subsist his fleet without\r\nprovisions; and the people would not sell their provisions to those who\r\nwere seeking to rob them of their liberties and to plunder their\r\nproperty. The English Annual Register observes:\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, the people in the fleet were distressed for provisions\r\nand necessaries of every sort, and were cut off from every kind of\r\nsuccour from the shore. This occasioned constant bickering between the\r\narmed ships and boats, and the forces that were stationed on the coast,\r\nparticularly at Norfolk. At length, upon the arrival of the _Liverpool_\r\nman-of-war from England, a flag was sent on shore to put the question\r\n\"whether they would supply his Majesty's ships with provisions?\" which\r\nbeing answered in the negative, and the ships in the harbour being\r\ncontinually annoyed by the fire of the rebels from that part of the town\r\nwhich lay next the water, it was determined to dislodge them by\r\ndestroying it. Previous notice being accordingly given to the\r\ninhabitants that they might remove from danger, the first day of the New\r\nYear (1776) was signalized by the attack, when a violent cannonade from\r\nthe _Liverpool_ frigate, two sloops of war, and the Governor's armed\r\nship the _Dunmore_, seconded by parties of sailors and marines, who\r\nlanded and set fire to the nearest houses, _soon produced the desired\r\neffect, and the whole town was reduced to ashes_.\"[382]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft eloquently observes: \"In this manner the Royal Governor\r\nburned and laid waste the best town in the oldest and most loyal colony\r\nof England, to which Elizabeth had given a name, and Raleigh devoted his\r\nfortune, and Shakspeare and Bacon and Herbert foretokened greatness; a\r\ncolony where the people themselves had established the Church of\r\nEngland, and where many were still proud of their ancestors, and in the\r\nday of the British Commonwealth had been faithful to the line of\r\nkings.\"[383]\r\n\r\nWhen Washington learned the fate of the rich emporium of his own\r\n\"country,\" for so he called Virginia, his breast heaved with waves of\r\nanger and grief. \"I hope,\" said he, \"this and the threatened devastation\r\nof other places will unite the whole country in one indissoluble band\r\nagainst a Government which seems lost to every sense of virtue and those\r\nfeelings which distinguish a civilized people from the most barbarous\r\nsavages.\"\r\n\r\nThus the loyal churchmen of Virginia received the same treatment from\r\nLord Dunmore as did the republican Congregationalists of Massachusetts\r\nfrom General Gage. The loyal Presbyterians of the two Carolinas\r\nexperienced similar treatment from Governors Campbell and Martin, as\r\nstated by the English Annual Register, in the preceding note. The three\r\nSouthern Governors each fled from their seats of government and betook\r\nthemselves to ships of war; while Gage was shut up in Boston until his\r\nrecall to England.\r\n\r\nThe Southern colonies, with those of New England, shared the same fate\r\nof misrepresentation, abuse, and invasion of their rights as British\r\nsubjects; the flames of discontent were spread through all the colonies\r\nby a set of incompetent and reckless Governors, the favourites and tools\r\nof perhaps the worst Administration and the most corrupt that ever ruled\r\nGreat Britain. All the colonies might adopt the language of the last\r\naddress of the Assembly of Virginia: \"We have exhausted every mode of\r\napplication which our inventions could suggest, as proper and promising.\r\nWe have decently remonstrated with Parliament; they have added new\r\ninjuries to the old. We have wearied the King with our supplications; he\r\nhas not deigned to answer them. We have appealed to the native honour\r\nand justice of the British nation; their efforts in our favour have been\r\nhitherto ineffectual.\" At the meeting of Parliament, October 26th,\r\n1775, the King was advised to utter in the Royal speech the usual\r\ndenunciation against the colonies, but the minority in Parliament (led\r\nby Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, General Conway, and Lord John Cavendish)\r\ndiscussed and denied the statements in the Royal speech, and exhibited\r\nthe results of the Ministerial warfare against the colonies at the close\r\nof the year 1775, the year before the Declaration of Independence. \"In\r\nthis contest,\" says the Annual Register of 1776, \"the speech was taken\r\nto pieces, and every part of it most severely scrutinized. The Ministers\r\nwere charged with having brought their Sovereign into the most\r\ndisgraceful and unhappy situation of any monarch now living. Their\r\nconduct had already wrested the sceptre of America out of his hands.\r\nOne-half of the empire was lost, and the other thrown into a state of\r\nanarchy and confusion. After having spread corruption like a deluge\r\nthrough the land, until all public virtue was lost, and the people were\r\ninebriated with vice and profligacy, they were then taught in the\r\nparoxysms of their infatuation and madness to cry out for havoc and war.\r\nHistory could not show an instance of such an empire ruined in such a\r\nmanner. They had lost a greater extent of dominion in the first campaign\r\nof a ruinous civil war, which was intentionally produced by their own\r\nacts, than the most celebrated conquerors had ever acquired in so short\r\na space of time.\r\n\r\n\"The speech was said to be composed of a mixture of assumed and false\r\nfacts, with some general undefined and undisputed axioms, which nobody\r\nwould attempt to controvert. Of the former, that of charging the\r\ncolonies with aiming at independence was severely reprehended, as being\r\ntotally unfounded, being directly contrary to the whole tenor of their\r\nconduct, to their most express declarations both by word and writing,\r\nand to what every person of any intelligence knew of their general\r\ntemper and disposition.[384] But what they never intended, we may drive\r\nthem to. They will, undoubtedly, prefer independence to slavery. They\r\nwill never continue their connection with this country unless they can\r\nbe connected with its privileges. The continuance of hostility, with the\r\ndetermined refusal of security for these privileges, will infallibly\r\nbring on separation.\r\n\r\n\"The charge of their making professions of duty and proposals of\r\nreconciliation only for the insidious purpose of amusing and deceiving,\r\nwas equally reprobated. It was insisted that, on the contrary, these had\r\nfrom the beginning told them honestly, openly and bravely, without\r\ndisguise or reserve, and declared to all the world, that they never\r\nwould submit to be arbitrarily taxed by any body of men whatsoever in\r\nwhich they were not represented. They did not whisper behind the door,\r\nnor mince the matter; they told fairly what they would do, and have\r\ndone, if they were unhappily urged to the last extremity. And that\r\nthough the Ministers affected not to believe them, it was evident from\r\nthe armament which they sent out that they did; for however incompetent\r\nthat armament has been to the end, nobody could admit a doubt that it\r\nwas intended to oppose men in arms, and to compel by force, the\r\nincompetence for its purposes proceeding merely from that blind\r\nignorance and total misconception of American affairs which had operated\r\nupon the Ministers in every part of their conduct.\r\n\r\n\"The shameful accusation,\" they said, \"was only to cover that wretched\r\nconduct, and, if possible, to hide or excuse the disgrace and failure\r\nthat had attended all their measures. Was any other part of their policy\r\nmore commendable or more successful? Did the cruel and sanguinary laws\r\nof the preceding session answer any of the purposes for which they were\r\nproposed? Had they in any degree fulfilled the triumphant predictions,\r\nhad they kept in countenance the overbearing vaunts of the Minister?\r\nThey have now sunk into the same nothingness with the terrors of that\r\narmed force which was to have looked all America into submission. The\r\nAmericans have faced the one, and they despise the injustice and\r\niniquity of the other....\r\n\r\n\"The question of rebellion was also agitated; and it was asserted that\r\nthe taking up of arms in the defence of just rights did not, according\r\nto the spirit of the British Constitution, come within that\r\ncomprehension. It was also asserted with great confidence, that\r\nnotwithstanding the mischiefs which the Americans had suffered, and the\r\ngreat losses they had sustained, they would still readily lay down their\r\narms, and return with the greatest good-will and emulation to their\r\nduty, if candid and unequivocal measures were taken for reinstating them\r\nin their former rights; but that this must be done speedily, before the\r\nevils had taken too wide an extent, and the animosity and irritation\r\narising from them had gone beyond a certain pitch.\r\n\r\n\"The boasted lenity of Parliament was much lauded. It was asked whether\r\nthe Boston Port Bill, by which, without trial or condemnation, a number\r\nof people were stripped of their commercial property, and even deprived\r\nof the benefit of their real estates, was an instance of it? Was it to\r\nbe found in the Fishery Bill, by which large countries were cut off from\r\nthe use of the elements, and deprived of the provision which nature had\r\nallotted for their sustenance? Or was taking away the Charter and all\r\nthe rights of the people without trial or forfeiture the measure of\r\nlenity from which such applause was now sought? Was the indemnity held\r\nout to military power lenity? Was it lenity to free soldiers from a\r\ntrial in the country where the murders with which they should stand\r\ncharged, when acting in support of civil and revenue officers, were\r\ncommitted, and forcing their accusers to come to England at the pleasure\r\nof a governor?\" ...\r\n\r\n\"The debate in the House of Lords was rendered particularly remarkable\r\nby the unexpected defection of a noble duke (Duke of Grafton) who had\r\nbeen for some years at the head of the Administration, had resigned of\r\nhis own accord at a critical period, but who had gone with the\r\nGovernment ever since, and was at this time in high office. The line\r\nwhich he immediately took was still more alarming to the Administration\r\nthan the act of defection. Besides a decisive condemnation of all their\r\nacts for some time past with respect to America, as well as of the\r\nmeasures now held out by the speech, he declared that he had been\r\ndeceived and misled upon that subject; that by the withholding of\r\ninformation, and the misrepresentation of facts, he had been induced to\r\nlend his countenance to measures which he never approved; among those\r\nwas that in particular of coercing America by force of arms, an idea the\r\nmost distant from his mind and opinions, but which he was blindly led to\r\ngive a support to from his total ignorance of the true state and\r\ndisposition of the colonies, and the firm persuasion held out that\r\nmatters would never come to an extremity of that nature; that an\r\nappearance of coercion was all that was required to establish a\r\nreconciliation, and that the stronger the Government appeared, and the\r\nbetter it was supported, the sooner all disputes would be adjusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"He declared that nothing less than a total repeal of all the American laws\r\nwhich had been passed since 1763 could now restore peace and happiness,\r\nor prevent the most destructive and fatal consequences--consequences which\r\ncould not even be thought of without feeling the utmost degree of grief\r\nand horror; that nothing could have brought him out in the present ill\r\nstate of his health but the fullest conviction of his being right--a\r\nknowledge of the critical situation of his country, and a sense of what\r\nhe owed to his duty and to his conscience; that these operated so strongly\r\nupon him, that no state of indisposition, if he were even obliged to come\r\nin a litter, should prevent his attending to express his utmost\r\ndisapprobation of the measures which were now being pursued, as well as\r\nof those which he understood from the lords in office it was intended\r\nstill to pursue. He concluded by declaring that if his nearest relations\r\nor dearest friends were to be affected by this question or that the loss\r\nof fortune, or of every other thing which he most esteemed, was to be\r\nthe certain consequence of his present conduct, yet the strong conviction\r\nand compulsion operating at once upon his mind and conscience would not\r\npermit him to hesitate upon the part which he should take.\r\n\r\n\"The address was productive of a _protest_ signed by _nineteen_ lords,\r\nin which they combat the civil war as unjust and impolitic in its\r\nprinciples, dangerous in its contingent and fatal in its final\r\nconsequences. They censured the calling in of foreign forces to decide\r\ndomestic quarrels as disgraceful and dangerous. They sum up and conclude\r\nthe protest by declaring: 'We cannot, therefore, consent to an address\r\nwhich may deceive his Majesty and the public into a belief of the\r\nconfidence of this House in the present Ministers, who have deceived\r\nParliament, disgraced the nation, lost the colonies, and involved us in\r\na civil war against our clearest interests, and upon the most\r\nunjustifiable grounds wantonly spilling the blood of thousands of our\r\nfellow-subjects.'\"[385]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: Annals, etc., Vol. II., p. 211. The annalist adds in a\r\nnote, that \"Of the British 226 were killed and 828 wounded; 19\r\ncommissioned officers being among the former, and 70 among the latter.\r\nOf the Americans, 139 were killed and 314 wounded and missing. The only\r\nprovincial officers of distinction lost were General Joseph Warren, Col.\r\nGardner, Lieut.-Col. Parker, and Messrs. Moore and McClany.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: The royal historian, Andrews, gives the following or\r\nEnglish account of the battle of Bunker's Hill, together with the\r\ncircumstances which preceded and followed it:\r\n\r\n(PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS.)\r\n\r\n\"On the 12th of June (1775), a proclamation was issued by the British\r\nGovernment at Boston, offering a pardon, in the King's name, to all who\r\nlaid down their arms and returned to their homes and occupations. Two\r\npersons only were excepted--Mr. Samuel Adams and Mr. John Hancock--whose\r\nguilt was represented as too great and notorious to escape punishment.\r\nAll who did not accept of this offer, or who assisted, abetted, or\r\ncorresponded with them, were to be deemed guilty of treason and\r\nrebellion, and treated accordingly. By this proclamation it was declared\r\nthat as the Courts of Judicature were shut, martial law should take\r\nplace, till a due course of justice could be re-established.\r\n\r\n\"But this act of Government was as little regarded as the preceding. To\r\nconvince the world how firmly they were determined to persevere in their\r\nmeasures, and how small an impression was made by the menaces of\r\nBritain, Mr. Hancock, immediately after his proscription, was chosen\r\nPresident of the Congress. The proclamation had no other effect than to\r\nprepare people's minds for the worst that might follow.\r\n\r\n\"The reinforcements arrived from Britain; the eagerness of the British\r\nmilitary to avail themselves of their present strength, and the position\r\nof the Provincials, concurred to make both parties diligent in their\r\npreparation for action. It was equally the desire of both: the first\r\nwere earnest to exhibit an unquestionable testimony of their\r\nsuperiority, and to terminate the quarrel by one decisive blow; the\r\nothers were no less willing to come to a second engagement (the first\r\nbeing that of Concord and Lexington), from a confidence they would be\r\nable to convince their enemies that they would find the subjugation of\r\nAmerica a much more difficult task than they hod promised themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Opposite to the northern shore of the peninsula upon which Boston\r\nstands, lies Charleston, divided from it by a river (Mystic) about the\r\nbreadth of the Thames at London Bridge. Neither the British nor\r\nProvincial troops had hitherto bethought themselves of securing this\r\nplace. In its neighbourhood, a little to the east, is a high ground\r\ncalled Bunker's Hill, which overlooks and commands the whole town of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\n\"In the night of the 16th of June, a party of the Provincials took\r\npossession of this hill, and worked with so much industry and diligence,\r\nthat by break of day they had almost completed a redoubt, together with\r\na strong intrenchment, reaching half a mile, as far as the River Mystic\r\nto the east. As soon as discovered they were plied with a heavy and\r\nincessant fire from the ships and floating batteries that surrounded the\r\nneck on which Charleston is situated, and from the cannon planted on the\r\nnearest eminence on the Boston side.\r\n\r\n\"This did not, however, prevent them from continuing their work, which\r\nthey had entirely finished by mid-day, when it was found necessary to\r\ntake more effectual methods to dislodge them.\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose a considerable body was landed at the foot of Bunker's\r\nHill, under the command of General Howe and General Pigot. The first was\r\nto attack the Provincial lines, the second the redoubt. The British\r\ntroops advanced with great intrepidity, but on their approach were\r\nreceived with a fire behind from the intrenchments, that continued\r\npouring during a full half hour upon them like a stream. The execution\r\nit did was terrible; some of the bravest and oldest officers declared\r\nthat, for the time it lasted, it was the hottest service they had ever\r\nseen. General Howe stood for some moments almost alone, the officers and\r\nsoldiers about him being nearly all slain or disabled; his intrepidity\r\nand presence of mind were remarkable on this trying occasion.\r\n\r\n\"General Pigot, on the left, was in the meantime engaged with the\r\nProvincials who had thrown themselves into Charleston, as well as with\r\nthe redoubt, and met with the same reception as the right. Though he\r\nconducted his attack with great skill and courage, the incessant\r\ndestruction made among the troops threw them at first into some\r\ndisorder; but General Clinton coming up with a reinforcement, they\r\nquickly rallied and attacked the works with such fury that the\r\nProvincials were not able to resist them, and retreated beyond the neck\r\nof land that leads into Charleston.\r\n\r\n\"This was the bloodiest engagement during the whole war. The loss of the\r\nBritish troops amounted in killed and wounded to upwards of 1,000. Among\r\nthe first were 19, and among the last 70 officers. Colonel Abercrombie,\r\nMajor Pitcairn, of the Marines, and Majors Williams and Spenlowe, men of\r\ndistinguished bravery, fell in this action, which, though it terminated\r\nto the advantage of the King's forces, cost altogether a dreadful price.\r\n\r\n\"The loss on the Provincial side, according to their account, did not\r\nexceed 500. This might be true, as they fought behind intrenchments,\r\npart of which were cannon proof, and where it was not possible for the\r\nmusketry to annoy them. This accounts no less for the numbers they\r\ndestroyed, to which the expertness of their marksmen chiefly\r\ncontributed. To render the dexterity of these completely effectual,\r\nmuskets ready loaded were handed to them as fast as they could be\r\ndischarged, that they might lose no time in reloading them, and they\r\ntook aim chiefly at the officers....\r\n\r\n\"The great slaughter occasioned on the left of the British troops, from\r\nthe houses in Charleston, obliged them to set fire to that place. The\r\nProvincials defended it for some time with much obstinacy, but it was\r\nquickly reduced to ashes; and when deprived of that cover, they were\r\nimmediately compelled to retire.\r\n\r\n\"But notwithstanding the honour of the day remained to the British\r\ntroops, the Americans boasted that the real advantages were on their\r\nside. They had, said they, so much weakened their enemies in this\r\nengagement, as to put an entire stop to their operations. Instead of\r\ncoming forth and improving their pretended victory, they did not dare to\r\nventure out of the trenches and fortifications they had constructed\r\nround Boston.\r\n\r\n\"The only apparent benefit gained by the troops was that they kept\r\npossession of the ground whereon Charleston had stood; they fortified it\r\non every side, in order to secure themselves from the sudden attacks\r\nthat were daily threatened from so numerous a force as that which now\r\ninvested Boston....\r\n\r\n\"The Provincials, on the other hand, to convince the troops how little\r\ntheir success had availed them, raised intrenchments on a height\r\nopposite Charleston, intimating to them that they were ready for another\r\nBunker's Hill business whenever they thought proper, and were no less\r\nwilling than they to make another trial of skill.\r\n\r\n\"Their boldness increased to a degree that astonished the British\r\nofficers, who had, unhappily, been taught to believe them a contemptible\r\nenemy, averse to the dangers of war, and incapable of the regular\r\noperations of an army. The skirmishes were now renewed in Boston Bay.\r\nThe necessities of the garrison occasioned several attempts to carry off\r\nthe remaining stock of cattle and other articles of provision the\r\nislands might contain. But the Provincials, who were better acquainted\r\nwith the navigation of the bay, landed on these islands, in spite of the\r\nprecaution of the numerous shipping, and destroyed or carried off\r\nwhatever could be of use; they even ventured so far as to burn the\r\nlight-house, situated at the entrance of the harbour, and afterwards\r\nmade prisoners of a number of workmen that had been sent to repair it,\r\ntogether with a party of marines that guarded them.\" (Dr. Andrews'\r\nHistory of the Late War, etc., Vol. I., Chap. xiii., pp. 300-306;\r\npublished under royal authority in 1785.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: History of the United States, Vol. VII., Chap. xxv., pp.\r\n271, 272.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: The Secretary of State had instructed Lord Dunmore to\r\ncall the Assembly together, in order to submit to them a \"conciliatory\r\nproposition,\" as it was called, which Lord North had introduced into\r\nParliament--a proposition calculated to divide the colonies, and then\r\nreduce each of them to servitude; but the colonies saw the snare, and\r\nevery one of them rejected the insidious offer. Lord Dunmore, in\r\nobedience to his instructions, assembled for the last time the Virginia\r\nHouse of Burgesses in June, 1775, to deliberate and decide upon Lord\r\nNorth's proposition. But while the Burgesses were deliberating upon the\r\nsubject submitted to them, Lord Dunmore, agitated by his own fears, left\r\nwith his family the seat of government, and went on board a ship of war.\r\nThe House of Burgesses, however, proceeded in their deliberations;\r\nreferred the subject to a Committee, which presented a report prepared\r\nby Mr. Jefferson, and adopted by the House, as a final answer to Lord\r\nNorth's proposal. They said, \"Next to the possession of liberty, they\r\nshould consider a reconciliation as the greatest of human blessings, but\r\nthat the resolution of the House of Commons only changed the form of\r\noppression, without lightening its burdens; that government in the\r\ncolonies was instituted not for the British Parliament, but for the\r\ncolonies themselves; that the British Parliament had no right to meddle\r\nwith their Constitution, or to prescribe either the number or the\r\npecuniary appointments of their officers; that they had a right to give\r\ntheir money without coercion, and from time to time; that they alone\r\nwere the judges, alike of the public exigencies and the ability of the\r\npeople; that they contended not merely for the mode of raising their\r\nmoney, but for the freedom of granting it; that the resolve to forbear\r\nlevying pecuniary taxes still left unrepealed the Acts restraining\r\ntrade, altering the form of government of Massachusetts, changing the\r\ngovernment of Quebec, enlarging the jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty,\r\ntaking away the trial by jury, and keeping up standing armies; that the\r\ninvasion of the colonies with large armaments by sea and land was a\r\nstyle of asking gifts not reconcilable to freedom; that the resolution\r\ndid not propose to the colonies to lay open a free trade with all the\r\nworld; that as it involved the interests of all the other colonies, they\r\nwere in honour bound to share one fate with them; that the Bill of Lord\r\nChatham on the one part, and the terms of Congress on the other, would\r\nhave formed a basis for negotiation and a reconciliation; that leaving\r\nthe final determination of the question to the General Congress, they\r\nwill weary the King with no more petitions--the British nation with no\r\nmore appeals.\" \"What then,\" they ask, \"remains to be done?\" and they\r\nanswer, \"That we commit our injuries to the justice of the even-handed\r\nBeing who doeth no wrong.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Shelburne read Mr. Jefferson's report, he said: \"In my\r\nlife I was never more pleased with a State paper than with the Assembly\r\nof Virginia's discussion of Lord North's proposition. It is masterly.\r\nBut what I fear is, that the evil is irretrievable.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Versailles, the French Minister, Vergennes, was equally attracted by\r\nthe wisdom and dignity of the document. He particularly noticed the\r\ninsinuation that a compromise might be effected on the basis of the\r\nmodification of the Navigation Acts; and saw so many ways opened of\r\nsettling every difficulty, that it was long before he could persuade\r\nhimself that the infatuation of the British Ministry was so blind as to\r\nneglect them all.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VII.,\r\nChap, xxxvii., pp. 386-388.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nxxv., p. 276.\r\n\r\n\"The offer of freedom to the negroes came very oddly from the\r\nrepresentative of the nation which had sold them to their present\r\nmasters, and of the King who had been displeased with the colony for its\r\ndesire to tolerate that inhuman traffic no longer; and it was but a sad\r\nresource for a commercial metropolis, to keep a hold on its colony by\r\nletting loose slaves against its own colonists.\"--_Ib._, p. 276.\r\n\r\n\"Dunmore's menace to raise the standard of a servile insurrection and\r\nset the slaves upon their masters, with British arms in their hands,\r\nfilled the South with horror and alarm. Besides, the retreat of the\r\nBritish troops from Concord raised the belief that the American forces\r\nwere invincible; and the spirit of resistance had grown so strong, that\r\nsome of the Burgesses appeared in the uniform of the recently instituted\r\nprovincial troops, wearing a hunting shirt of coarse linen over their\r\nclothes, and a woodman's axe by their sides.\"--_Ib._, pp. 384, 385.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: \"Meantime, Dunmore, driven from the land of Virginia,\r\nmaintained command of the water by means of a flotilla composed of the\r\n_Mercury_, of 24 guns; the _Kingfisher_, of 16; the _Otter_, of 14, with\r\nother ships and light vessels, and tenders which he had engaged in the\r\nKing's service. At Norfolk, a town of about 6,000 inhabitants, a\r\nnewspaper was published by John Holt. About noon on the last day of\r\nSeptember (1775), Dunmore, finding fault with its favouring (according\r\nto him) 'sedition and rebellion,' sent on shore a small party, who,\r\nmeeting with no resistance, seized and brought off two printers and all\r\nthe materials of the printing office, so that he could publish from his\r\nship a Gazette on the side of the King. The outrage, as we shall see,\r\nproduced retaliation.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol.\r\nVIII., Chap. lv., pp. 220, 221.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VIII.,\r\nChap. lv., pp. 221, 222.\r\n\r\nThe English Annual Register of 1776 states as follows the policy of Lord\r\nDunmore, culminating in the successful defence of Hampton and the\r\nrepulse of his ships:\r\n\r\n\"Whether Lord Dunmore expected that any extraordinary advantages might\r\nbe derived from an insurrection of the slaves, or that he imagined there\r\nwas a much greater number of people in the colony who were satisfied\r\nwith the present system of government than really was the case (_a\r\nmistake, and an unfortunate one, which, like an epidemical distemper,\r\nseems to have spread through all our official departments in\r\nAmerica_)--upon whatever grounds he proceeded, he determined, though he\r\nrelinquished his government, not to abandon his hopes, nor entirely to\r\nlose sight of the country which he had governed. He, accordingly, being\r\njoined by those friends of government who had rendered themselves too\r\nobnoxious to the people to continue with safety in the country, as well\r\nas by a number of runaway negroes, and supported by the frigates of war\r\nwhich were upon the station, endeavoured to establish such a marine\r\nforce as would enable him, by means of the noble rivers, which render\r\nthe most valuable parts of that rich country accessible by water, to be\r\nalways at hand and ready to profit by any favourable occasion that\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this or some similar system he by degrees equipped and armed a\r\nnumber of vessels of different kinds and sizes, _in one of which he\r\nconstantly resided, never setting his foot on shore but in a hostile\r\nmanner_. The force thus put together was, however, _calculated only for\r\ndepredation_, and never became equal to any essential service. The\r\nformer, indeed, was in part a matter of necessity; for as the people on\r\nshore would not supply those on board with provisions or necessaries,\r\nthey must either starve or provide them by force.... These proceedings\r\noccasioned the sending of some detachments of the new-raised forces of\r\nthe colonists to protect their coasts, and from these ensued a small,\r\nmischievous, predatory war, incapable of affording honour or benefit,\r\nand in which, at length, every drop of water and every necessary was\r\npurchased at the price or risk of blood.\r\n\r\n\"During this state of hostility, Lord Dunmore procured a few soldiers\r\nfrom different parts, with whose assistance an attempt (Oct. 25th) was\r\nmade to burn a post town in an important situation called Hampton. It\r\nseems the inhabitants had some previous suspicion of the design, for\r\nthey had sunk boats in the entrance of the harbour and thrown such other\r\nobstacles in the way as rendered the approach of the ships, and\r\nconsequently a landing, impracticable on the day when the attack was\r\ncommenced. The ships cut a passage through the boats in the night, and\r\nbegan to cannonade the town furiously in the morning; but at this\r\ncritical period the townspeople were relieved from their apprehensions\r\nand danger by the arrival of a detachment of rifle and minute men from\r\nWilliamsburg, who had marched all night to their assistance. These,\r\njoined with the inhabitants, attacked the ships so vigorously with their\r\nsmall arms that they were obliged precipitately to quit their station,\r\nwith the loss of some men and of a tender, which was taken.\" (Annual\r\nRegister, Vol. XIX., Fourth Edition, pp. 26, 27.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: English Annual Register, Vol. XIX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: British Annual Register, Vol. XIX., p. 31.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft's account of this barbarous conflagration is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"New Year's day, 1776, was the saddest day that ever broke on the women\r\nand children then in Norfolk; warned of their danger by the commander of\r\nthe squadron, there was for them no refuge. The _Kingfisher_ was\r\nstationed at the upper end of Norfolk; a little below her, the _Otter_;\r\nBelew, in the _Liverpool_, anchored near the middle of the town; and\r\nnext him lay the _Dunmore_; the rest of the fleet was moored in the\r\nharbour. Between three and four in the afternoon, the _Liverpool_ opened\r\nits fire upon the borough; the other ships immediately followed the\r\nexample, and a severe cannonade was begun from about sixty pieces of\r\ncannon. Dunmore then himself, as night was coming on, ordered out\r\nseveral boats to burn warehouses on the wharves; and hailed to Belew to\r\nset fire to a large brig which lay in the dock. All the vessels of the\r\nfleet, to show their zeal, sent great numbers of boats on shore to\r\nassist in spreading the flames along the river; and as the buildings\r\nwere chiefly of pine wood, the conflagration, favoured by the wind,\r\nspread with amazing rapidity, and soon became general. Women and\r\nchildren, mothers with little ones in their arms, were seen by the glare\r\nrunning through the shower of cannon balls to get out of their range.\r\nTwo or three persons were hit; and the scene became one of extreme\r\nhorror and confusion. Several times the British attempted to land, and\r\nonce to bring cannon into the street; but they were driven back by the\r\nspirit and conduct of the Americans. The cannonade did not abate till\r\nten at night; after a short pause it was renewed, but with less fury,\r\nand was kept up till two the next morning. The flames, which had made\r\ntheir way from street to street, raged for three days; till four-fifths,\r\nor, as some computed, nine-tenths of the houses were reduced to ashes\r\nand heaps of ruins.\" (History of the United States, Vol. VIII., Chap.\r\nlvi., pp. 230, 231.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: History of the United States, Vol. VIII., Chap. lvi., p.\r\n231.\r\n\r\nThe English Annual Register observes: \"Such was the fate of the\r\nunfortunate town of Norfolk, the most considerable for commerce in the\r\ncolony, and so growing and flourishing before these unhappy troubles,\r\nthat in the two years from 1773 to 1775, the rents of the houses\r\nincreased from £8,000 to £10,000 a year. However just the cause, or\r\nurgent the necessity, which induced this measure, it was undoubtedly a\r\ngrievous and odious task to a Governor to be himself the principal actor\r\nin burning and destroying the best town in his government.\r\n\r\n\"Nor was the situation of other Governors in America much more eligible\r\nthan that of Lord Dunmore. In South Carolina, Lord William Campbell,\r\nhaving as they said, entered into a negotiation with the Indians for\r\ncoming in to the support of the Government in that province, and having\r\nalso succeeded in exciting a number of those back settlers whom we have\r\nheretofore seen distinguished in the Carolinas, under the title of\r\nRegulators, to espouse the same cause, the discovery of these measures,\r\nbefore they were ripe for execution, occasioned such a ferment among the\r\npeople, that he thought it necessary to retire from Charleston on board\r\na ship of war in the river, from whence he returned no more to the seat\r\nof his government.\r\n\r\n\"Similar measures were pursued in North Carolina (with the difference\r\nthat Governor Martin was more active and vigorous in his proceedings),\r\nbut attended with as little success. The Provincial Congress,\r\nCommittees, and Governor were in a continual state of the most violent\r\nwarfare. Upon a number of charges, particularly of fomenting a civil\r\nwar, and exciting an insurrection among the negroes, he was declared an\r\nenemy to America in general, and to that colony in particular, and all\r\npersons were forbidden from holding any communication with him. These\r\ndeclarations he answered with a proclamation of uncommon length, which\r\nthe Provincial Congress resolved to be a false, scandalous, scurrilous\r\nand seditious libel, and ordered it to be burned by the hands of the\r\ncommon hangman.\r\n\r\n\"As the Governor expected, by means of the back settlers, as well as of\r\nthe Scotch inhabitants and Highland emigrants, who were numerous in the\r\nprovince, to be able to raise a considerable force, he took pains to\r\nfortify and arm his palace at Newburn, that it might answer the double\r\npurpose of a garrison and a magazine. Before this could be effected, the\r\nmoving of some cannon excited such a commotion among the people that he\r\nfound it necessary to abandon the palace and retire on board a\r\nsloop-of-war in Cape Fear river. The people upon this occasion\r\ndiscovered powder, shot, ball, and various military stores and\r\nimplements which had been buried in the palace garden and yard. This\r\nserved to inflame them exceedingly, every man considering it as if it\r\nhad been a plot against himself in particular.\r\n\r\n\"The Provincial Congress published an address to the inhabitants of the\r\nBritish empire, of the same nature with those we have formerly seen to\r\nthe people of Great Britain and Ireland, containing the same professions\r\nof loyalty and affection, and declaring the same earnest desire of a\r\nreconciliation.\" (English Annual Register, Vol. XIX., pp. 31-33.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: General Conway said: \"The noble lord who has the\r\ndirection of the affairs of this country tells you that the Americans\r\naim at Independence. I defy the noble lord, or any other member of this\r\nHouse, to adduce one solid proof of this charge. He says: 'The era of\r\n1763 is the time they wish to recur to, because such a concession on our\r\npart would be, in effect, giving up their dependence on this country.' I\r\nwould ask the noble lord, Did the people of America set up this claim\r\nprevious to the year 1763? No; they were then peaceful and dutiful\r\nsubjects. They are still dutiful and obedient. (Here was a murmur of\r\ndisapprobation.) I repeat my words; I think them so inclined; I am sure\r\nthey would be so, if they were permitted: The acts they have committed\r\narise from no want of either. They have been forced into them. Taxes\r\nhave been attempted to be levied on them; their Charters have been\r\nviolated, nay, taken away; administration has attempted to coerce them\r\nby the most cruel and oppressive laws.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: Annual Register, Vol. XIX., Chap. ix., pp. 57, 58, 63,\r\n69, 70, 74, 75.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLING OF CONGRESS, MAY 10TH, 1776, AND TRANSACTIONS UNTIL THE\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE 4TH OF JULY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was under the circumstances stated in the preceding chapter, the\r\nGeneral Congress, according to adjournment the previous October,\r\nreassembled in Philadelphia the 10th of May, 1776. The colonies were\r\nprofoundly convulsed by the transactions which had taken place in\r\nMassachusetts, Virginia, North and South Carolina, by the intelligence\r\nfrom England, that Parliament had, the previous December, passed an Act\r\nto increase the army, that the British Government had largely increased\r\nboth the army and navy, and on failure of obtaining sufficient recruits\r\nin England, Scotland, and Ireland, had negotiated with German princes,\r\nwho traded in the blood of their down-trodden subjects, for seventeen\r\nthousand Hanoverian and Hessian mercenaries, to aid in reducing the\r\nAmerican colonies to absolute submission to the will of the King and\r\nParliament of Great Britain. It was supposed in England that the\r\ndecisive Act of Parliament, the unbending and hostile attitude of the\r\nBritish Ministry, the formidable amount of naval and land forces, would\r\nawe the colonies into unresisting and immediate submission; but the\r\neffect of all these formidable preparations on the part of the British\r\nGovernment was to unite rather than divide the colonies, and render them\r\nmore determined and resolute than ever to defend and maintain their\r\nsacred and inherited rights and liberties as British subjects.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen colonies were a unit as to what they understood and\r\ncontended for in regard to their British constitutional rights and\r\nliberties--namely, the rights which they had enjoyed for more than a\r\ncentury--the right of taxation by their own elected representatives\r\nalone, the right of providing for the support of their own civil\r\ngovernment and its officers--rights far less extensive than those which\r\nare and have long been enjoyed by the loyal provinces of the Canadian\r\nDominion. There were, indeed, the Governors and their officers, sent\r\nfrom England--the favourites and needy dependents of the British\r\nMinistry and Parliament, sent out to subsist upon the colonists, but\r\nwere not of them, had no sympathy with them, nor any influence over them\r\nexcept what they had over their dependents and the families with whom\r\nthey had formed connections. They were noisy and troublesome as a\r\n_faction_, but not sufficient in numbers or influence to constitute a\r\n_party_, properly speaking.\r\n\r\nThere was like unity among the colonies in regard to the _defence_ and\r\n_support_ of the rights and liberties which they claimed. There was,\r\nindeed, doubt on the part of a few, and but a few, comparatively, as to\r\nthe wisdom and expediency of taking arms and meeting the King's officers\r\nand troops in the field of battle in support of their rights; but all\r\nagreed that they should defend themselves and their property when\r\nattacked by the King's troops, whether attacked by the King's orders or\r\nnot; for they held that their title to their property and constitutional\r\nrights was as sacred and divine as that of the King to his throne.[386]\r\n\r\nThe question of questions with the General Congress on its assembling\r\nin May, 1776, was what measures should be adopted for the defence of\r\ntheir violated and invaded rights, and upon what grounds should that\r\ndefence be conducted? For the first time in the General Congress was it\r\nproposed to abandon the ground on which they had vindicated and\r\nmaintained their rights as British subjects in their several\r\nLegislatures and Conventions for eleven years, and successfully defended\r\nthem by force of arms for more than one year, or to avow entire\r\nseparation from the mother country, and declare absolute independence as\r\nthe ground of maintaining their rights and liberties?\r\n\r\nThere had long been some prominent men who held republican sentiments,\r\nand some newspapers had in 1775 mooted the idea of separation from the\r\nmother country. Such views prevailed widely in Massachusetts; there had\r\nalways been a clique of Congregational Republicans and Separationists in\r\nBoston, from the days of Cromwell. They looked back upon the halcyon\r\ndays when none but Congregationalists could hold office--civil,\r\njudicial, or military--or even exercise the elective franchise, and the\r\ndisclaimers of any earthly king; and though the separation from the\r\nmother country and renunciation of monarchical government was carefully\r\navoided in the official documents of Massachusetts, as it was disclaimed\r\nin the strongest terms in the official papers of other colonies, yet the\r\nsentiment of hostility to monarchy and of separation from England was\r\nartfully inculcated in resolutions, addresses, etc., prepared by Samuel\r\nAdams, and sent forth from the Massachusetts Convention.[388] He was a\r\nman of blameless life (no relation to John Adams)--a rigid religionist\r\nof the old Massachusetts Puritan stamp--a hater of England and of\r\nBritish institutions, able and indefatigable in everything that might\r\ntend to sever America from England, in regard to which his writings\r\nexerted a powerful influence. He was the Corypheus of the Separatist\r\nparty in Boston, the Chairman of the Committee of Correspondence, and\r\nwrote the Massachusetts circulars to other colonies.\r\n\r\nIt was only early in May, 1776, that the question of independence was\r\ndiscussed in the General Congress. The Congress _recommended_ those\r\ncolonies whose Governors had left their governments, or were declared\r\ndisqualified on account of their oppressive and cruel conduct, to form\r\ngovernments for themselves. This, however, was not understood as a\r\ndeclaration of independence, but a temporary measure of necessity, to\r\nprevent anarchy and confusion in the colonies concerned. This proceeding\r\nwas immediately followed by a more comprehensive measure intended to\r\nfeel the pulse of the colonies on the subject of independence.\r\n\r\nThe Congress had waited with considerable patience, and some anxiety,\r\nthe result of the late session of Parliament; they had forborne to do\r\nanything which might not be justified upon the fair principles of\r\nself-defence, until it appeared that the Ministry was resolved that\r\nnothing short of the most abject submission should be the price of\r\naccommodation. Early in May, therefore, the Congress adopted a measure\r\nintended to sound the sentiments of the colonies on the subject of\r\nindependence. They stated the rejection of their petitions, and the\r\nemployment of foreign mercenaries to reduce them to obedience, and\r\nconcluded by declaring it expedient that all the colonies should proceed\r\nto the establishment of such a form of government as their\r\nrepresentatives might think most conducive to the peace and happiness of\r\nthe people. This preamble and resolution were immediately forwarded; and\r\nin a few days afterwards Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, gave notice to\r\nthe Congress that he should, on an appointed day, move for a\r\n_Declaration of Independence_. This was accordingly done, but the\r\nconsideration of the question was postponed until the 1st of July--_so\r\ntimid, so wavering, so unwilling to break the maternal connection were\r\nmost of the members_.[389]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, so far from the Declaration of Independence being the\r\nspontaneous uprising of the colonies, as represented by so many American\r\nhistorians, that when it was first mooted in Congress the majority of\r\nthe General Congress itself were startled at it, and were opposed to it.\r\n\"On the 15th day of May, only four of the colonies had acted definitely\r\non the question of independence. North Carolina had authorized her\r\ndelegates to concur with the delegates from the other colonies 'in\r\ndeclaring independency;' Rhode Island had commissioned hers 'to join in\r\nany measures to secure American rights;' in Massachusetts, various towns\r\nhad pledged themselves to maintain any declaration on which Congress\r\nmight agree; and Virginia had given positive instructions to her\r\ndelegates that Congress should make a declaration of independence. These\r\nproceedings were accompanied with declarations respecting a reservation\r\nto each colony of the right to form its own government, in the\r\nadjustment of the power universally felt to be necessary, and which was\r\nto be lodged in a new political unit, designated by the terms,\r\n'Confederation,' 'Continental Constitution,' and 'American\r\nRepublic.'\"[390]\r\n\r\n\"On the 7th of June, Richard Henry Lee, in behalf of the Virginia\r\ndelegates, submitted in Congress resolves on independence, a\r\nconfederation, and foreign alliances. His biographer says that\r\n'tradition relates that he prefaced his motion with a speech,'\r\nportraying the resources of the colonies and their capacity for defence,\r\ndwelling especially on the bearing which an independent position might\r\nhave on foreign Powers, and concluded by urging the members so to act,\r\nthat the day might give birth to an American Republic. The motion was:--\r\n\r\n\"'That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and\r\nindependent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the\r\nBritish Crown, and that all political connection between them and the\r\nState of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.'\r\n\r\n\"'That it is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual measures for\r\nforming foreign alliances.'\r\n\r\n\"'That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to the\r\nrespective colonies for their consideration and approbation.'\r\n\r\n\"John Adams seconded the motion. The Journal of Congress says, 'that\r\ncertain resolutions respecting independency being moved and seconded,\r\nthey were postponed till to-morrow morning,' and that 'the members were\r\nenjoined to attend punctually at ten o'clock in order to take the same\r\ninto their consideration. Jefferson says the reason of postponement was\r\nthat the House were obliged to attend to other business. The record\r\nindicates that no speech was made on that day.\r\n\r\n\"The next day was Saturday. John Hancock, the President, was in the\r\nchair; and Charles Thompson was the Secretary. The resolves were\r\nimmediately referred to a Committee of the Whole, in which Benjamin\r\nHarrison presided--the confidential correspondent of Washington, and\r\nsubsequently Governor of Virginia. They were debated with animation\r\nuntil seven o'clock in the evening, when the President resumed the\r\nchair, and reported that the Committee had considered the matter\r\nreferred to them, but, not having come to any decision, directed him to\r\nmove for leave to sit again on Monday.\r\n\r\n\"In Congress, on Monday, Edward Rutledge moved that the question be\r\npostponed three weeks. The debate on this day continued until seven\r\no'clock in the evening. Not a single speech of any member is known to be\r\nextant. Jefferson at the time summed up the arguments used by the\r\nspeakers during both days. The result may be given in his words: 'It\r\nappearing, in the course of the debates, that the colonies of New York,\r\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina were\r\nnot yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they were\r\nfast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait awhile\r\nfor them. It was agreed in Committee of the Whole to report to Congress\r\na resolution, which was adopted by a vote of seven colonies to five, and\r\nthis postponed the resolution on independence to the 1st day of July;\r\nand 'in meanwhile, that no time be lost, a Committee be appointed to\r\nprepare a declaration in conformity to it.' On the next day a Committee\r\nwas chosen for this purpose by ballot: Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia;\r\nJohn Adams, of Massachusetts; Benjamin Franklin, of Pennsylvania; Roger\r\nSherman, of Connecticut; and Robert R. Livingstone, of New York. [Such\r\nwas the Committee that prepared the Declaration of Independence.] On the\r\n12th a Committee of one from each colony was appointed to report the\r\nform of confederation, and a Committee of five to prepare a plan of\r\ntreaties to be proposed to foreign Powers.\r\n\r\n\"When Congress postponed the vote on independence, the popular movement\r\nin its favour was in full activity. Some of the members left this body\r\nto engage in it. Others promoted it by their counsel.\"[391]\r\n\r\n\"On the day agreed upon for the consideration of Mr. Lee's motion, the\r\n1st of July, Congress resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole; the\r\ndebates on the question were continued with great warmth for _three\r\ndays_. It had been determined to take the vote by _colonies_; and as a\r\nmaster-stroke of policy, the author of which is not known to history, it\r\nhad been proposed and agreed, that _the decision on the question,\r\nwhatever might be the state of the votes, should appear to the world as\r\nthe unanimous voice of the Congress_. On the first question [of\r\nindependence], _six_ colonies were in the affirmative, and _six_ in the\r\nnegative--_Pennsylvania_ being without a vote by the equal division of\r\nher delegates. In this state of the business, it appears, on the\r\nauthority of evidence afterwards adduced before Parliament, that Mr.\r\n_Samuel Adams_ once more successfully exerted his influence; and that\r\none of the delegates of Pennsylvania was brought over to the side of\r\nindependence. It is more probable, however, that the influence of Mr.\r\nAdams extended no further than to procure that one of the dissenting\r\nmembers withdraw from the House; and that the vote of Pennsylvania was\r\nthus obtained.\"[392]\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the Declaration of Independence, so far from being\r\nthe spontaneous uprising of the American colonies, was the result of\r\nmonths of agitation by scarcely a dozen leaders in the movement, by\r\ncanvassing at public meetings, and of delegates elected by them, not\r\nexcelled by any political and nearly balanced parties in England or\r\nCanada in a life and death struggle for victory. In this case, the\r\nimportant question was to be decided by some fifty members of Congress;\r\nand when the first vote was given, after many weeks of popular\r\nagitation, and three days of warm discussion in Congress, there was a\r\ntie--six colonies for and six against the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--after which a majority of one was obtained for the\r\nDeclaration, by inducing the absence of certain members opposed to it;\r\nand then, when a majority of votes was thus obtained, others were\r\npersuaded to vote for the measure \"_for the sake of unanimity_,\" though\r\nthey were opposed to the measure itself.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed been represented by some American historians, that the\r\nvote of Congress for Independence was _unanimous_; but the fact is far\r\notherwise. As the vote was taken by _colonies_, and not by the majority\r\nof the individual members present, as in ordinary legislative\r\nproceedings, the majority of the delegates from each colony determined\r\nthe vote of that colony; and by a previous and very adroit proposal, an\r\nagreement was entered into that the _vote of Congress should be\r\npublished to the world as_ UNANIMOUS, however divided the votes of\r\nmembers on the question of Independence might be; and on this ground the\r\nsignatures of those who had opposed it, as well as of those who voted in\r\nfavour of it, were ultimately affixed to the Declaration, though it was\r\npublished and authenticated by the signatures of the President, John\r\nHancock, of Massachusetts, and Charles Thompson, of Philadelphia, as\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence, as thus adopted, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"A Declaration by the Representatives of the United _States_ of\r\n     America, in Congress assembled:\r\n\r\n     \"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one\r\n     people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them\r\n     with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the\r\n     separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's\r\n     God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\r\n     requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to\r\n     such separation.\r\n\r\n     \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created\r\n     equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\n     unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are\r\n     instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent\r\n     of the governed; and whenever any form of government becomes\r\n     destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter\r\n     or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its\r\n     foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such\r\n     form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and\r\n     happiness. Prudence, indeed, would dictate that governments long\r\n     established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\r\n     and accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more\r\n     inclined to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right\r\n     themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed;\r\n     but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing\r\n     invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under\r\n     absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw\r\n     off such government, and to provide new guards for their future\r\n     security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies,\r\n     and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their\r\n     former systems of government. The history of the present King of\r\n     Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations;\r\n     all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute\r\n     tyranny over these States: to prove this, let facts be exhibited to\r\n     a candid world.\r\n\r\n     \"He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary\r\n     for the public good.\r\n\r\n     \"He has forbidden his Governours to pass laws of immediate and\r\n     pressing importance, unless suspended in their operations till his\r\n     assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly\r\n     neglected to attend to them.\r\n\r\n     \"He has refused to pass other laws, for the accommodation of large\r\n     districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the\r\n     rights of representation in the Legislature; a right inestimable to\r\n     them, and formidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\n     \"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\n     uncomfortable, and distant from the depositories of their public\r\n     records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance\r\n     with his measures.\r\n\r\n     \"He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing,\r\n     with manly firmness, his invasion on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"He has refused, for a long time after such dissolution, to cause\r\n     others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of\r\n     annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their\r\n     exercise--the State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the\r\n     dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n\r\n     \"He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for\r\n     that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners,\r\n     refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and\r\n     raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.\r\n\r\n     \"He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his\r\n     assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\r\n\r\n     \"He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of\r\n     their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\n     \"He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms\r\n     of officers, to harass our people and eat out their substance.\r\n\r\n     \"He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without\r\n     the consent of our Legislatures.\r\n\r\n     \"He has affected to render the military independent of, and\r\n     superior to, the civil power.\r\n\r\n     \"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\r\n     foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws, giving\r\n     his assent to their pretended acts of legislation.\r\n\r\n     \"For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.\r\n\r\n     \"For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any\r\n     murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     \"For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"For imposing taxes on us without our consent.\r\n\r\n     \"For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefit of trial by jury.\r\n\r\n     \"For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended\r\n     offences.\r\n\r\n     \"For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring\r\n     Province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and\r\n     enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and\r\n     fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these\r\n     colonies.\r\n\r\n     \"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable laws,\r\n     and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments.\r\n\r\n     \"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\r\n     invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\n     \"He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his\r\n     protection, and waging war against us.\r\n\r\n     \"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns,\r\n     and destroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\n     \"He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign\r\n     mercenaries to complete the work of death, desolation, and tyranny,\r\n     already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely\r\n     paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the\r\n     head of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\n     \"He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high\r\n     seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the\r\n     executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves\r\n     by their hands.\r\n\r\n     \"He has excited domestick insurrections amongst us, and has\r\n     endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the\r\n     merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is\r\n     undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\r\n\r\n     \"In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress\r\n     in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered\r\n     only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by\r\n     every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a\r\n     free people.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We\r\n     have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their\r\n     Legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us; we\r\n     have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\r\n     settlement here; we have appealed to their native justice and\r\n     magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common\r\n     kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\r\n     interrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have been\r\n     deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must, therefore,\r\n     acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold\r\n     them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace\r\n     friends.\r\n\r\n     \"We therefore, the representatives of the United States of America,\r\n     in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\r\n     the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and\r\n     by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly\r\n     publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right\r\n     ought to be, Free and Independent States; and that they are\r\n     absolved from allegiance to the British Crown; and that all\r\n     political connection between them and the State of Great Britain\r\n     is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free and\r\n     independent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude\r\n     peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other\r\n     acts and things which independent States may of right do. And for\r\n     the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the\r\n     protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other\r\n     our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This Declaration will be discussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: \"The theory that the popular leaders were playing a game\r\nof hypocrisy may be tested in the case of Washington, whose sterling\r\npatriotism was not more conspicuous than his irreproachable integrity.\r\nThe New York Provincial Congress, in an address to him (June 26th,\r\n1775), on his way from Philadelphia to the American camp around Boston,\r\nsay that accommodation with the mother country was 'the fondest wish of\r\neach American soul.' Washington, in reply, pledged his colleagues and\r\nhimself to use every exertion to re-establish peace and harmony. 'When\r\nwe assumed the soldier,' he said, 'we did not lay aside the citizen; and\r\nwe shall most sincerely rejoice with you in that happy hour when the\r\nestablishment of American liberty on the most solid and firm foundations\r\nshall enable us to return to our private stations, in the bosom of a\r\nfree, peaceful, and happy country.'[387] There was no incompatibility in\r\nthe position of military leader of a great uprising with a desire to\r\npreserve the old political ties. When the Barons of Runnymede,\r\nsurrounded by their retainers, wrested from King John the great Charter,\r\nthey meant not to renounce their allegiance, but simply to preserve the\r\nold government. Though an act of apparent rebellion, yet it was in the\r\nstrictest sense an act of loyalty. So the popular leaders, in their\r\nattitude of armed resistance, were loyal to what they conceived to be\r\nessential to American liberty. They were asserting the majesty of\r\nconstitutional law against those who would have destroyed it, and thus\r\nwere more loyal to the Constitution than was George III. There really is\r\nno ground on which justly to question the sincerity of declarations like\r\nthose of Congress and Washington. They aimed at a redress of grievances;\r\nand the idea was quite general, of a Bill of Rights, or an American\r\nConstitution, embodying the conditions on which the integrity of the\r\nempire might be preserved. This was their last appeal for a settlement\r\non such a basis.\" (Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United\r\nStates, Chap. xi., pp. 438, 439.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: \"The London Chronicle of August 8th, 1775, has the speech\r\nof the New York Provincial Congress, and the reply of Washington of the\r\n26th of June, 1775.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: Mr. Bancroft, writing under date of October, 1775, says:\r\n\"The Americans had not designed to establish an independent government;\r\nof their leading statesmen it was the desire of Samuel Adams alone; they\r\nhad all been educated in the love and admiration of constitutional\r\nmonarchy; and even John Adams and Jefferson so sincerely shrank back\r\nfrom the attempt at creating another government in its stead, that, to\r\nthe last moment, they were most anxious to avert a separation, if it\r\ncould be avoided without a loss of their inherited liberties.\" (History\r\nof the United States, Vol. VIII., Chap. li., p. 161.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: Allan's American Revolution, Vol. I., pp. 342, 343.\r\n\r\n\"The interval was employed in unceasing exertions by the friends of\r\nindependence to prepare the minds of the people for the necessity and\r\nadvantages of such a measure. The press teemed with essays and\r\npamphlets, in which all the arts of eloquence were used to ridicule the\r\nprejudices which supported an attachment to the King and Government of\r\nEngland. Among the numerous writers on this momentous question, the most\r\nluminous, the most eloquent, and the most forcible was _Thomas Paine_.\r\nHis pamphlet entitled 'Common Sense' was not only read, but understood,\r\nby everybody; and those who regard the independence of the _United\r\nStates_ as a blessing will never cease to cherish the remembrance of\r\n_Thomas Paine_. Whatever may have been his subsequent career--in\r\nwhatever light his religious principles may be regarded--it should never\r\nbe forgotten that _to him, more than to any single individual, was owing\r\nthe rapid diffusion of those sentiments and feelings which produced the\r\nact of separation from Great Britain_.\"--_Ib._, pp. 343, 344.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United States,\r\np. 512.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United States,\r\nChap. xi., pp. 513-517.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: Allan's American Revolution, Chap, xii., pp. 344, 345.\r\n\r\n\"The question before the Committee was the portion of the _motion\r\nrelating to independence_, submitted by the Virginia delegates on the\r\n7th of June. The New York members read their instructions, and were\r\nexcused from voting. Of the three delegates from Delaware, Rodney was\r\nabsent, Read in the negative, and thus the vote of that colony was lost.\r\nSouth Carolina was in the negative; and so was Pennsylvania, by the\r\nvotes of Dickenson, Willing, Morris, and Humphries, against those of\r\nFranklin, Morton, and Wilson. Nine colonies--New Hampshire, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, Georgia--voted in the affirmative. The Committee rose, the\r\nPresident resumed the chair, and Harrison reported the resolution as\r\nhaving been agreed to. Edward Rutledge, of South Carolina, said that\r\nwere the vote postponed till next day, he believed that his colleagues,\r\nthough they disapproved of the resolution, would then join in it for the\r\nsake of unanimity. The final question, in accordance with this request,\r\nwas postponed until the next day; but it was agreed to go into Committee\r\non the draft of the Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"On the 2nd July, probably fifty members were present in Congress. After\r\ndisposing of the business of the morning, it resumed the resolution _on\r\nindependence_, and probably without much debate proceeded to vote.\r\nMcKean sent an express to Rodney, at Dover, which procured his\r\nattendance, and secured the vote of Delaware in the affirmative; while\r\nthe same result was reached for Pennsylvania by Dickenson and Morris\r\nabsenting themselves, and allowing Franklin, Wilson, and Morton to give\r\nthe vote against Willing and Humphries. The South Carolina delegates\r\nconcluded to vote for the measure. Thus twelve colonies united in\r\nadopting the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"'That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and\r\nindependent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the\r\nBritish Crown, and that all political connection between them and the\r\nState of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.'\"\r\n(Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United States, Chap. xi., pp.\r\n537, 538.)\r\n\r\nOn the adoption of this resolution, continues the same historian,\r\n\"Congress went immediately into Committee of the Whole to consider the\r\ndraft of a Declaration of Independence, or the form of announcing the\r\nfact to the world. During the remainder of that day, and during the\r\nsessions of the 3rd and 4th, the phraseology, allegations, and\r\nprinciples of this paper were subjected to severe scrutiny. Its author\r\nrelates: 'The pusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth\r\nkeeping terms with still haunted the minds of many. For this reason,\r\nthose passages which conveyed censure on the people of England were\r\nstruck out, lest they should give them offence. The clause, too,\r\nreprobating the enslaving of the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in\r\ncomplaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to\r\nrestrain the importation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, wished to\r\ncontinue it. Our northern brethren also, I believe, felt a little tender\r\nunder these censures; for though their people had very few slaves\r\nthemselves, yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to\r\nothers.' (Memoirs of Jefferson, i. 15.) The striking out of the passage\r\ndeclaring the slave trade 'piratical warfare against human nature\r\nitself,' was deeply regretted by many of that generation. Other\r\nalterations were for the better, making the paper more dispassionate and\r\nterse, and--what was no small improvement--more brief and exact. On the\r\nevening of the 4th the Committee rose, when Harrison reported the\r\nDeclaration as having been agreed upon. It was then adopted by twelve\r\nStates, unanimously.\" [That is, by the majority of the delegates of\r\ntwelve provinces, and, of course, _reported_ as \"unanimous,\" according\r\nto previous agreement.]--_Ib._, p. 539.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters bear ample testimony how heartily I have\r\nsympathized with our elder brother colonists of America, in their\r\nconception and manly advocacy and defence of their constitutional rights\r\nas British subjects; how faithfully I have narrated their wrongs and\r\nadvocated their rights, and how utterly I have abhorred the despotic\r\nconduct of George the Third, and of his corrupt Ministers and mercenary\r\nand corrupted Parliament, in their unscrupulous efforts to wrest from\r\nthe American colonists the attributes and privileges of British freemen,\r\nand to convert their lands, with their harbours and commerce, into mere\r\nplantations and instruments to enrich the manufacturers and merchants of\r\nEngland, and provide places of honour and emolument for the scions and\r\nprotegees of the British aristocracy and Parliament. But I cannot\r\nsympathize with, much less defend, the leaders of the old American\r\ncolonists in the repudiating what they had professed from their\r\nforefathers; in avowing what they had for many years denied; in making\r\ntheir confiding and distinguished defenders in the British\r\nParliament--the Chathams, Camdens, Sherburnes, the Foxes, Burkes, and\r\nCavendishes--liars in presence of all Europe; in deliberately practising\r\nupon their fellow-colonists what they had so loudly complained of\r\nagainst the King and Parliament of Great Britain; in seeking the\r\nalliance of a Power which had sought to destroy them for a hundred\r\nyears, against the land of their forefathers which had protected them\r\nduring that hundred years, and whose Administration had wronged and\r\nsought to oppress them for only twelve years.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of anxious study and reflection, I have a strong\r\nconviction that the Declaration of American Independence, in 1776, was a\r\ngreat mistake in itself, a great calamity to America as well as to\r\nEngland, a great injustice to many thousands on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, a great loss of human life, a great blow to the real liberties\r\nof mankind, and a great impediment to the highest Christian and\r\nAnglo-Saxon civilization among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nIn this summary statement of opinion--so contrary to the sentiments of\r\nAmerican historians and to popular feeling in the United States--I mean\r\nno reflection on the motives, character, patriotism, and abilities of\r\nthose great men who advocated and secured the adoption of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in the General Congress of 1776. I believe\r\nAmerica has never produced a race of statesmen equal in purity of\r\ncharacter, in comprehensiveness of views, in noble patriotism and moral\r\ncourage, to \"the Fathers of the American Revolution.\" Their discussions\r\nof public questions, during the eleven years which preceded the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, evince a clearness of discernment, an\r\naccuracy of statement, a niceness of distinction, a thorough knowledge\r\nof the principles of government, and the mutual relation of colonies and\r\nthe parent State, elegance of diction, and force of argument, not\r\nsurpassed in discussions of the kind in any age or country; their\r\ndiplomatic correspondence displays great superiority in every respect\r\nover the English statesmen of the day, who sought to oppress them; the\r\ncorrespondence of Washington with General Gage commanded alike the\r\nadmiration of Europe and the gratitude of America; the memorials and\r\nother public papers transmitted to England by the American Congress, and\r\nwritten by Jay and other members, drew forth from the Earl of Chatham,\r\nin the House of Lords, January 20th, 1775, the following eulogy: \"When\r\nyour lordships look at the papers transmitted to us from America--when\r\nyou consider their decency, firmness, and wisdom, you cannot but respect\r\ntheir cause, and wish to make it your own. For myself, I must avow that\r\nin all my reading--and I have read Thucydides, and have studied and\r\nadmired the master States of the world--for solidity of reason, force of\r\nsagacity, and wisdom of conclusion under a complication of difficult\r\ncircumstances, no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the\r\nGeneral Congress at Philadelphia. The histories of Greece and Rome give\r\nus nothing equal to it, and all attempts to impose servitude upon such a\r\nmighty continental nation must be vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be forced ultimately to retract; let us retract while we can,\r\nnot when we must. These violent Acts must be repealed; you will repeal\r\nthem; I pledge myself for it, I stake my reputation on it, that you will\r\nin the end repeal them.\"\r\n\r\n(Those violent Acts were repealed three years afterwards.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Shelburne read the reply, written by Jefferson, of the\r\nVirginia Legislature, to Lord North's proposition, his Lordship said:\r\n\"In my life, I was never more pleased with a State paper than with the\r\nAssembly of Virginia's discussion of Lord North's proposition. It is\r\nmasterly. But what I fear is that the evil is irretrievable.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the statesmanlike productions of that period, the correspondence\r\nof Franklin, the masterly letters of Dickenson, the letters and State\r\npapers of Samuel and John Adams, Jay and Livingstone, and of many\r\nothers, exhibit a scholarly race of statesmen and writers of whom any\r\nnation or age might be proud.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be forgotten that the education of every one of these\r\ngreat men, and their training in public affairs, was under English\r\nconstitutional government, for which every one of them (except Samuel\r\nAdams) expressed their unqualified admiration, and to which they avowed\r\ntheir unswerving attachment to within twelve months of the declaration\r\nof independence. Though the United States can boast of many\r\ndistinguished scholars and politicians and jurists, I believe American\r\ndemocracy has never produced a generation of scholarly, able, and\r\nstainless statesmen, such as those who had received the whole of their\r\nmental, moral, and political training when America formed a part of the\r\nBritish empire.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, indeed, that the major part (for they were not\r\nunanimous) of so noble and patriotic a class of statesmen should, by the\r\nwicked policy and cruel measures against them by the worst\r\nadministration of government that ever ruled England, be betrayed into\r\nan act which they had so many years disavowed. Placing, as they rightly\r\ndid, in the foreground the civil and religious liberties of Englishmen\r\nas the first ingredient of the elements of political greatness and\r\nsocial progress, they became exasperated into the conviction that the\r\nlast and only effective means of maintaining those liberties was to\r\nsever their connection with England altogether, and declare their own\r\nabsolute independence. We honour the sentiments and courage which\r\nprompted them to maintain and defend their liberties; we question not\r\nthe purity and patriotism of their motives in declaring independence as\r\nthe means of securing those liberties; but we must believe that, had\r\nthey maintained the integrity of their professions and positions for\r\neven a twelvemonth longer, they would have achieved all for which they\r\nhad contended, would have become a free and happy country, as Canada now\r\nis, beside the mother country and not in antagonism to her, maintaining\r\ninviolate their national life and traditions, instead of forming an\r\nalliance for bloody warfare with their own former and their mother\r\ncountry's hereditary enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was unnatural and disgraceful for the British Ministry to employ\r\nGerman mercenaries and savage Indians to subdue the American colonists\r\nto unconditional obedience; but was it less unnatural for the colonists\r\nthemselves to seek and obtain the alliance of the King of France, whose\r\ngovernment was a despotism, and who had for a hundred years sought to\r\ndestroy the colonists, had murdered them without mercy, and employed by\r\nhigh premiums the Indians to butcher and scalp men, women, and children\r\nof the colonists--indeed, to \"drive them into the sea,\" and to\r\nexterminate them from the soil of America? Yet with such enemies of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, with such enemies of their own liberties,\r\nand even their existence as Anglo-Saxons, the colonists sought and\r\nobtained an alliance against the mother country, which had effectually,\r\nand at an immense expenditure, defended them against the efforts of both\r\nFrance and Spain to destroy them. Had the American colonists maintained\r\nthe position and professions after 1776, as they had maintained them\r\nbefore 1776, presenting the contrast of their own integrity and unity\r\nand patriotism to the perfidious counsels, mercenary and un-English\r\npolicy of the British Ministry and Parliament, they would have escaped\r\nthe disastrous defeats and bloodshed of 1777-8, and would have repeated\r\nthe victories which they had gained over the English soldiers in 1775\r\nand the early part of 1776. Unprepared and sadly deficient in arms and\r\nammunition, they repulsed the regular English soldiers sent against them\r\nat Concord, at Lexington, at Bunker's Hill; they had shut up as\r\nprisoners the largest English army ever sent to New England, and, though\r\ncommanded by such generals as Howe and Clinton, compelled their\r\nevacuation of the city of Boston. In the Southern States they had routed\r\nthe English forces, and had compelled the Governors of Virginia and\r\nSouth and North Carolina to take refuge on board of English men-of-war.\r\nBefore the declaration of independence, the colonists fought with the\r\nenthusiasm of Englishmen for Englishmen's rights, and the British\r\nsoldiers fought without heart against their fellow-subjects contending\r\nfor what many of both the soldiers and officers knew to be rights dear\r\nto all true Englishmen; but when the Congress of the American colonies\r\ndeclared themselves to be no longer Englishmen, no longer supporters of\r\nthe constitutional rights of Englishmen, but separationists from\r\nEngland, and seeking alliance with the enemies of England, then the\r\nEnglish army felt that they were fighting against enemies and not\r\nfellow-subjects, and fought with an energy and courage which carried\r\ndisaster, in almost every instance, to the heretofore united but now\r\ndivided colonists, until France and Spain came to their assistance.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary and general remarks, we proceed to state more\r\nspecifically the grounds on which we regard, as a calamity to the\r\ninterests of true liberty and of civilization, the change of position,\r\npolicy, and principles avowed by the General Congress in the Declaration\r\nof Independence, 1776.\r\n\r\nI. The Declaration of Independence was a renunciation of all the\r\nprinciples on which the General Congress, Provincial Legislatures, and\r\nConventions professed to act from the beginning of the contest. The\r\nforegoing pages present abundant testimony and illustration how\r\nearnestly, how constantly, how unanimously the American colonists\r\nexpressed their attachment to the mother country and to the principles\r\nof the British Constitution--how indignantly they repelled, as an insult\r\nand a slander, every suspicion and statement that they meditated or\r\ndesired _independence_, or that they would ever consent to sever the\r\nties of their connection with the mother country and the glorious\r\nprinciples of her constitution of government.\r\n\r\nIn the same Congress of 1775, by which Washington was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief, the higher departments of the army were organized.\r\nBills of credit to the amount of three millions were emitted to defray\r\nthe expenses of the war, and after the battles of Lexington and Bunker's\r\nHill, while the English army were shut in Boston by the Provincial\r\nvolunteers, a declaration was signed by Congress, justifying their\r\nproceedings, but disdaining any idea of separation from England. They\r\nsay, \"We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconstitutional\r\nsubmission to the tyranny of irritated Ministers, or resistance by\r\nforce. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this\r\ncontest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honour,\r\njustice, and humanity forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which\r\nwe received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity\r\nhave a right to receive from us....\r\n\r\n\"With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most\r\nsolemnly, before God and the world, _declare_ that, exerting the utmost\r\nenergy of those powers which our beneficent Creator hath graciously\r\nbestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to\r\nassume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness\r\nand perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being\r\nwith one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of our friends and\r\nfellow-subjects in any part of the empire, _we assure them that we mean\r\nnot to dissolve that union which has so long and so happily subsisted\r\nbetween us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored_. Necessity has\r\nnot yet driven us to that desperate measure, or induced us to excite any\r\nother nation to war against them. _We have not raised armies with\r\nambitious designs of separating from Great Britain, and of establishing\r\nindependent States._ We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit\r\nto mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked\r\nenemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast\r\nof their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder\r\nconditions than servitude or death.\r\n\r\n\"In our native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright,\r\nand which we ever enjoyed until the late violation of it, for the\r\nprotection of our property acquired solely by the honest industry of\r\nour forefathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we\r\nhave taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease\r\non the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed\r\nshall be removed, and not before.\"[393]\r\n\r\n\"Amidst these hostile operations, the voice of peace was yet\r\nheard--allegiance to the King was still acknowledged, and a lingering\r\nhope remained that an accommodation was not impossible. Congress voted a\r\npetition to his Majesty, replete with professions of duty and\r\nattachment; and addressed a letter to the people of England, conjuring\r\nthem, by the endearing appellations of 'friends, countrymen, and\r\nbrethren,' to prevent the dissolution of 'that connection which the\r\nremembrance of former friendships, pride in the glorious achievements of\r\ncommon ancestors, and affection for the heirs of their virtues had\r\nheretofore maintained.' _They uniformly disclaimed any idea of\r\nindependence, and professed themselves to consider union with England,\r\non constitutional principles_, as the greatest blessing which could be\r\nbestowed on them.\"[394]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply authorities and illustrations; the whole\r\ntenor of the history of the colonies, as presented in the preceding\r\nchapters of this volume, evinces their universal appreciation of the\r\nprinciples of the British Constitution and their universal attachment to\r\nunion with the mother country.[395]\r\n\r\nEven in the spring of 1776, after months of agitation by advocates of\r\nseparation in various colonies, a majority of the delegates in Congress\r\nwere for weeks opposed to separation; and it required long preparation\r\nto familiarize the minds of its advocates to separation, and to\r\nreconcile any considerable number of colonists to hostile severance from\r\nthe land of their forefathers. It may easily be conceived what must have\r\nbeen the shock to a large part, if not a majority, of the colonists, to\r\nhave burst upon them, after weeks' secret session of Congress, a\r\ndeclaration which, under the term Independence, renounced all the\r\nprinciples and associations in which they had been educated, which they\r\nhad often avowed and held dear from their ancestors, which proclaimed\r\ntheir mother country their enemy, and denounced connection with her a\r\ncrime. Such a renunciation of the past, and wrenching from it, could not\r\notherwise than weaken the foundations of society and the obligation of\r\noaths, as may be seen by a comparison in these respects of the\r\nsacredness of laws and oaths, and their administration in America before\r\nand since the revolution.\r\n\r\nII. The Declaration of Independence was a violation of good faith to\r\nthose statesmen and numerous other parties in England who had, in and\r\nout of Parliament, supported the rights and character of the colonies\r\nduring the whole contest. They had all done so upon the ground that the\r\ncolonists were contending for the constitutional rights of Englishmen;\r\nthat they intended and desired nothing more. On the ground that the\r\ncolonists, like the barons of Runnymede, were contending for the sacred\r\nrights of Englishmen, and relying on the faith of their declaration that\r\nEnglishmen they would ever remain, their cause was patriotically\r\nespoused and nobly vindicated in England by Lords Chatham, Camden,\r\nShelburne, the Duke of Richmond, and others in the House of Lords; by\r\nMessrs. Burke and Fox, Lord John Cavendish, Mr. Dunning (afterwards Lord\r\nAshburton), and others in the House of Commons; and by corporations of\r\ncities and towns, and multitudes out of Parliament. Lord Mahon, in the\r\nsixth volume of his History of England (pp. 35-37), relates that before\r\nthe Earl of Chatham introduced his famous \"Provincial Bill for Settling\r\nTroubles in America,\" and supported it by his masterly speeches in the\r\nLords, he sent for Dr. Franklin, the principal representative of the\r\ncolonists, to consult him and ascertain from him distinctly whether\r\nthere was any tendency or danger of the American colonies separating\r\nfrom England, and was assured by Dr. Franklin that there was not the\r\nleast feeling in that direction; that the American colonies were\r\nuniversally loyal to connection with the mother country, and desired and\r\ncontended for nothing more than the constitutional rights of\r\nEnglishmen.[396]\r\n\r\nIt was not till after this assurance, and it was under this conviction\r\nand with this object, that the Earl of Chatham delivered those appeals\r\nin behalf of America which electrified the British public, and gave tone\r\nto the subsequent debates in both Houses of Parliament. These eloquent\r\nand unanswerable defences of British rights, invaded and denied in\r\nregard to the persons of the American colonists, were delivered in 1775\r\nand the early part of 1776; but scarcely had their echoes died away on\r\nthe waves of the Atlantic, when news came from America that the\r\nCongress, so warmly eulogized in the British Parliament for its fidelity\r\nto English connection, as well as to the rights of England, had, after a\r\nsecret session of two months, renounced all connection with England, and\r\nall acknowledgment of its authority and principles of government, thus\r\nfulfilling the statements and predictions of the parliamentary enemies\r\nof American rights, and presenting their advocates, Chatham, Camden,\r\nBurke, etc., as liars and deceivers before the British nation and in the\r\nface of all Europe. The Ministerial party triumphed; the advocates of\r\ncolonial rights were confounded, and their influence in and out of\r\nParliament was paralyzed. The power of the corrupt Ministers who had\r\nbeen oppressing the colonies for ten years, was tottering to their fall;\r\nthey had played their last card; they had exhausted their credit; they\r\nhad staked their existence on the truth of the statements they had made,\r\nand the accomplishment of the measures they had adopted; their measures\r\nhad failed; they saw that half-armed colonists had everywhere repulsed\r\nthe picked English generals and soldiers; their statements as to the\r\nintentions and principles of the colonists would have also been\r\nfalsified had the Congress in 1776 adhered to the declaration of\r\nprinciples and avowal of purposes which it had made in 1775; the friends\r\nof American rights would have been triumphant, in and out of Parliament,\r\nin England, and 1777 would doubtless have witnessed the overthrow of the\r\ncorrupt British Ministry, the constitutional freedom of the American\r\ncolonies in connection with the unity of the empire, instead of seven\r\nyears' bloody warfare, the destruction of the national life and of the\r\noneness of the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\nIII. But the Declaration of Independence on the part of its authors was\r\nnot only a violation of good faith to the statesmen and others in\r\nEngland who had advocated the constitutional rights of the colonists, it\r\nwas also a violation both of good faith and justice to their colonial\r\nfellow-countrymen who continued to adhere to connection with the mother\r\ncountry upon the principles professed in all times past by the\r\nseparationists themselves.[397]\r\n\r\nThe adherents of connection with England had, with the exception of\r\ncertain office-holders and their relations, been as earnest advocates of\r\ncolonial rights as had the leaders of the separation. The opponents of\r\nthe constitutional rights of the colonies, in the colonies, were few and\r\nfar between--not numerous enough to form a party, or even to be called a\r\nparty. The Congress of 1775 declared the colonies to be \"a unit\" in\r\ntheir determination to defend their rights, but disdained the idea of\r\nseparation from the mother country; and Mr. John Adams stated at the\r\nsame time: \"All America is united in sentiment. When a masterly\r\nstatesman, to whom America has erected a statue in her heart for his\r\nintegrity, fortitude, and perseverance in her cause, invented a\r\nCommittee of Correspondence in Boston, did not every colony, nay, every\r\ncounty, city, hundred, and town upon the whole continent adopt the\r\nmeasure as if it had been a revelation from above? Look over the\r\nresolves of the colonies for the past year; you will see that one\r\nunderstanding governs, one heart animates the whole.\"[398]\r\n\r\nSuch were the sentiments and feelings of America in resisting the\r\ninnovations upon their rights of a British Ministry, while they denied\r\nthe idea of separation from the mother country as a calumny; and such\r\nwere the grounds on which millions in England and Scotland, in and out\r\nof Parliament, supported them.[399]\r\n\r\n\"Though that measure (independence), a few months before, was not only\r\nforeign from their wishes, but the object of their abhorrence, the\r\ncurrent suddenly became so strong in its favour that it bore down all\r\nopposition. The multitude was hurried down the stream; but some worthy\r\nmen could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea of an eternal\r\nseparation from a country to which they had long been bound by the most\r\nendearing ties.\" (Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., pp.\r\n161, 162.)\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Congress at Philadelphia voted, by a majority of\r\none or two, but declaring that their vote should be published as\r\nunanimous, to renounce all the professions of the past of connection\r\nwith the mother country, to declare her their enemy, and to avow eternal\r\nseparation from her, it may be easily conceived how a large portion of\r\nthe colonists would feel that their confidence had been betrayed; that\r\nthe representations they had made to English statesmen would bear the\r\nstamp of untruth; that their hopes had been blasted, and that they were\r\nnow to be treated as rebels and traitors for adhering to the faith of\r\ntheir forefathers; for, as Mr. Allan remarks, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence \"left no neutrals. He who was not for independence,\r\nunconditional independence, was an enemy.\"[400] Thus the many tens of\r\nthousands of colonists who adhered to the faith of their forefathers,\r\nand the traditions and professions of their own personal history, were,\r\nby a single act of Congress, declared \"enemies\" of their country,\r\n\"rebels,\" and even \"traitors,\" because they would not renounce their\r\noath of allegiance, and swear allegiance to a self and newly-created\r\nauthority, to relinquish the defence of the rights of Englishmen for the\r\ntheory of republican independence, adherence to which had been advocated\r\nby the Chathams and Burkes in the British Parliament, in preference to\r\nthe new doctrines propounded by the leaders in the Philadelphia\r\nCongress, for maintaining the unity and life of a great nation rather\r\nthan dismember and destroy it. Was it doing as one would be done by? Was\r\nit not a violation of good faith, and hard treatment, for men to be\r\ndeclared by a new tribunal criminals in July, for maintaining what all\r\nhad held to be loyal and patriotic in January? All the arguments and\r\nappeals of the Northern States against the separation of the Southern\r\nStates from the Republic, as destructive of the life of the nation, in\r\nthe recent civil war of 1864-1869, were equally strong, on the same\r\nground, against the separation of the American colonies from the mother\r\ncountry in the civil war of 1776-1783. The United Empire Loyalists of\r\nthat day were, as the conservators of the life of the nation, against\r\nthe dismemberment of the empire, as are the Americans of the Northern\r\nStates of the present day the conservators of the life of their nation\r\nin opposing the dismemberment of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIV. But this is not all. This Declaration of the 4th of July, 1776, was\r\nthe commencement of persecutions, proscriptions, and confiscations of\r\nproperty against those who refused to renounce the oaths which they had\r\ntaken, as well as the principles and traditions which had, until then,\r\nbeen professed by their persecutors and oppressors as well as by\r\nthemselves. The declaration of independence had been made in the name\r\nand for the professed purposes of liberty; but the very first acts under\r\nit were to deprive a large portion of the colonists not only of liberty\r\nof action, but liberty of thought and opinion--to extract from them\r\noaths and declarations which could not have been sincere, and which\r\ncould have been little better than perjuries, for the sole purpose of\r\nsaving life, liberty, or property. They were a numerous and intelligent\r\nportion of the community; were equally interested in the welfare of the\r\ncountry as their assailants, instead of being designated by every\r\nepithet of opprobrium, and denied the freedom of opinion and privileges\r\nof citizenship.[401] Mr. Elliott remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"The Tories comprised a large number, among whom were many rich,\r\ncultivated, and kindly people; these last, above all, needed watching,\r\nand were most dangerous. In looking over the harsh treatment of the\r\nTories by the rebels, it should be remembered that a covert enemy is\r\nmore dangerous than an open one, and that the Tories comprised both of\r\nthese. Many men of property and character in Massachusetts were in\r\nfavour of England, partly from conviction and partly from fear. That\r\nlarge and often cultivated class called \"Conservatives,\" who hold by the\r\npast rather than hope for the future, and are constitutionally timid,\r\nfeared change; they were naturally Tories. Most of the Episcopalians in\r\nNew England (though not in Virginia) opposed the revolutionary\r\nmovements. They had felt the oppression and contempt of the New England\r\nCongregationalists, and looked to the English Government and the English\r\nChurch for help. But in Virginia, where they were strong, this was not\r\nso; and there the Episcopalians were among the warmest asserters of the\r\nrights of man.\"\r\n\r\n\"In New York there was at first a very large proportion of Tories; in\r\n1776, not less than twelve hundred and ninety-three persons, in the\r\nCounty of Queen's alone, professed themselves subjects to the King. In\r\nSuffolk County, eight hundred enrolled themselves as King's militia.\"\r\n\r\n\"In New Jersey, Governor Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin, led the\r\nKing's friends, and was active against the Americans until it became\r\nnecessary to put him in confinement. The war carried on between Tories\r\nand Whigs was more merciless than any other, and more cruel and wanton\r\nthan that of the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws were made in Rhode Island against all who supplied the enemy with\r\nprovisions, or gave them information.\r\n\r\n\"In Connecticut the Tories were not allowed to speak or write against\r\nCongress or the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"In Massachusetts a man might be banished unless he would swear fealty\r\nto the cause of liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Severe laws were also passed against the Tories in New Hampshire, New\r\nYork, New Jersey, and Virginia, and in nearly all the colonies now\r\nseaboard States.\r\n\r\n\"John Jay thought the Confiscation Act of New York inexcusable and\r\ndisgraceful.\"[402]\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth remarks: \"Very serious was the change in the legal position\r\nof the class known as Tories--in many of the States a very large\r\nminority, and in all, respectable for wealth and social position. Of\r\nthose thus stigmatized, some were inclined to favour the utmost claims\r\nof the mother country; but _the greater part, though determined to\r\nadhere to the British connection, yet deprecated the policy which had\r\nbrought on so fatal a quarrel_. This loyal minority, especially its more\r\nconspicuous members, as the warmth of political feeling increased, had\r\nbeen exposed to the violence of mobs, and to all sorts of personal\r\nindignities, in which private malice or a wanton and violent spirit of\r\nmischief had been too often gratified under the guise of patriotism. By\r\nthe recent political changes, Tories and suspected persons became\r\nexposed to dangers from the law as well as from mobs. Having boldly\r\nseized the reins of government, the new State authorities claimed the\r\nallegiance of all residents within their limits, and under the lead and\r\nrecommendation of Congress, those who refused to acknowledge their\r\nauthority, or who adhered to their enemies, were exposed to severe\r\npenalties, confiscation of property, imprisonment, banishment, and\r\nfinally death.\"[403]\r\n\r\nThus was a large minority of the most wealthy and intelligent (their\r\nwealth and intelligence making them the greater criminals) inhabitants\r\nof the colonies, by the act of a new body not known to the Constitutions\r\nof any of their provinces, reduced to the alternative of violating their\r\nconvictions, consciences, and oaths, or being branded and treated as\r\nenemies of their country, deprived not only of the freedom of the press\r\nand of speech, but made criminals for even neutrality and silence, and\r\ntheir property confiscated to defray the expenses of a war upon\r\nthemselves. Had Congress, in July, 1776, maintained the principles and\r\nobjects it avowed even in the autumn of 1775, there would have been no\r\noccasion of thus violating good faith and common justice to the large\r\nminority of the colonies; there is every reason to believe that there\r\nwould have been a universal rallying, as there had been the year before,\r\nin defence of the constitutional rights of Englishmen and the unimpaired\r\nlife of the empire; there would have been a far larger military force of\r\nenthusiastic and patriotic volunteers collected and organized to defend\r\nthose rights than could ever afterwards be embodied to support\r\nindependence; there would have been a union of the friends of\r\nconstitutional liberty on both sides of the Atlantic; good faith would\r\nhave been kept on both sides, and the \"millions in England and\r\nScotland,\" sustained by the millions in America, instead of being\r\nabandoned by them in the very crisis of the contest in the mother\r\ncountry, would have achieved in less than a twelvemonth a victory for\r\nfreedom, for civilization, and for humanity, far beyond what had been\r\naccomplished in the English Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nV. The Declaration of Independence was the commencement of weakness in\r\nthe army of its authors, and of defeats in their fields of battle. The\r\nDeclaration has been announced as the birth of a nation, though it was\r\nactually the dismemberment of a nation. It was hailed with every\r\ndemonstration of joy and triumph on the part of those who had been\r\nprepared for the event, and no efforts were spared on the part of those\r\nwho had advocated independence in the army, in the Congress, and in the\r\nprovinces, to accompany the circulation of the Declaration with every\r\nenthusiastic expression of delight and anticipated free government, in\r\nwhich, of course, they themselves would occupy the chief places of\r\nprofit and power. But this enthusiasm, notwithstanding the glowing\r\ndescriptions of some American historians, was far from being general or\r\nardent. Lord Mahon says: \"As sent forth by Congress, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence having reached the camp of Washington, was, by his orders\r\n(as commanded by Congress), read aloud at the head of every regiment.\r\nThere, as in most other places, it excited much less notice than might\r\nhave been supposed.\" An American author of our own day (President Reed),\r\nmost careful in his statements, and most zealous in the cause of\r\nindependence, observes that \"No one can read the private correspondence\r\nof the times without being struck with the slight impression made on\r\neither the army or the mass of the people by the Declaration.\"[404]\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant-General, in his familiar and almost daily letters to his\r\nwife, does not even allude to it. But though there was little\r\nenthusiasm, there were some excesses. At New York a party of soldiers,\r\nwith tumultuary violence, tore down and beheaded a statue of the King\r\nwhich stood upon Broadway, having been erected only six years before.\r\nWashington, greatly to his honour, did not shrink from the duty of\r\nrebuking them next day, in his General Orders, for their misdirected\r\nzeal.[405]\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks after the Declaration of Independence, Washington's\r\narmy, composed of forces raised before that Declaration, consisted of\r\n27,000 men--a larger army than he was ever after able to assemble, and\r\nmore than twice as large as he commanded within a few months afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen with what readiness, zeal, and enthusiasm thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of volunteers offered their services during the year\r\n1775, and the first part of the year 1776, in defence of British\r\nliberty, in union with the friends of civil liberty and defenders of\r\nAmerican liberty in England; but when, after the Declaration of the 4th\r\nof July, 1776, the cause became one of Congressional liberty instead of\r\nBritish liberty, of separation from the mother country instead of union\r\nwith it, of a new form of government instead of one to which they had\r\nsworn allegiance, and which they had ever lauded and professed to\r\nlove,--then, in these novel circumstances, the provincial army dwindled\r\nfrom day to day by desertions, as well as from other causes, and\r\nrecruiting its ranks could only be effected by bounties in money and\r\nthe promise of lands; the uninterrupted victories of the colonists\r\nduring the twelve months previous to the Declaration of Independence\r\nwere succeeded by uninterrupted defeats during the twelve months\r\nsucceeding it, with the exception of the brilliant and successful\r\nsurprise raids which Washington made upon _Trenton_ and _Princeton_. But\r\nthese exploits were wholly owing to Washington's skill, and sleepless\r\nenergy, and heroic courage, with feeble forces, in contrast to the\r\nlethargy and self-indulgence of the English officers on the one hand and\r\nthe inactivity of Congress on the other.\r\n\r\nThe first trial of strength and courage between the English and\r\nrevolutionary forces took place in August, a few weeks after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, in the battle of Long Island, in which\r\nWashington's army was completely defeated; New York and all New Jersey\r\nsoon fell into the hands of the British. For this success General Howe\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood, as did General Carlton for similar\r\nsuccess in Canada--the one becoming Sir William Howe, and the other Sir\r\nGuy Carlton; but neither did much afterwards to merit the honour. The\r\nEnglish officers seemed to have anticipated a pastime in America instead\r\nof hard fighting and severe service, and the German mercenaries\r\nanticipated rich plunder and sensual indulgence.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and winter following Washington's defeat at Long Island\r\nand forced evacuation of New York, and indeed of New Jersey, Sir William\r\nHowe buried himself in self-indulgent inactivity for six months in New\r\nYork; while a portion of his army sought quarters and plunder, and\r\ncommitted brutal acts of sensuality, in the chief places of New Jersey.\r\nLoyalty seems to have been the prevalent feeling of New Jersey on the\r\nfirst passing of the King's troops through it.[406]\r\n\r\nThis is stated on unquestionable authority (see the previous note);\r\nscarcely any of the inhabitants joined the American retreating army,\r\nwhile numbers were daily flocking to the royal army. But within twelve\r\nmonths, when that royal army passed through the same country, on the\r\nevacuation of Philadelphia by Sir Henry Clinton (Sir William Howe having\r\nreturned to England), the inhabitants were universally hostile, instead\r\nof being universally loyal, as the year before. The royal historian\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"In setting out on this dangerous retreat, the British general clearly\r\nperceived that it would be indispensably necessary to provide for all\r\npossible contingencies. _His way lay entirely through an enemy's\r\ncountry, where everything was hostile in the extreme, and from whence no\r\nassistance or help of any sort was to be expected._\"[407]\r\n\r\nThe causes of this change in the feelings of the inhabitants of the\r\nJerseys, in the space of a few months, in regard to the British army and\r\nmother country, will be a subject of future inquiry; but, in the\r\nmeantime, the manifest failure of the revolutionary army to maintain its\r\nposition during the twelve months following the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, its declining numbers, and the difficulty of recruiting\r\nits ranks, show that the act of violent severance from the mother\r\ncountry did not spring from the heart and intellect of the colonists,\r\nbut from a portion of them which had obtained all the resources of\r\nmaterial and military power, under the profession of defending their\r\nrights as British subjects, with a view to ultimate reconciliation and\r\nunion with the mother country; but had used their advantages to declare\r\nseverance from the mother country, to excite hatred against it, and\r\nestablish themselves in sovereignty over America. Referring to the state\r\nof the colonies toward the close of 1777, the latest American historian,\r\nMr. Frothingham, says:\r\n\r\n\"This was a period of great political languor. The burden of the war was\r\nseverely felt. The blaze of freedom, it was said, that burst forth at\r\nthe beginning had gone down, and numbers, in the thirst for riches, lost\r\nsight of the original object. (Independent Chronicle, March 12, 1778.)\r\n'Where,' wrote Henry Laurens (successor to John Hancock as the President\r\nof the Congress) to Washington, 'where is virtue, where is patriotism\r\nnow, when almost every man has turned his thoughts and attention to gain\r\nand pleasures?'\" (Letter, November 20, 1778.)[408]\r\n\r\nVI. The Declaration of Independence was the avowed expedient and prelude\r\nto a sought-for alliance with France and Spain against the mother\r\ncountry, notwithstanding they had sought for a hundred years to\r\nextirpate the colonists, and had been prevented from \"driving them into\r\nthe sea\" by the aid of the army and navy and vast expenditure of the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult to reconcile with truthfulness, fairness, and\r\nconsistency, the intrigues and proposed terms of alliance between the\r\nleaders of Congress and the King of France. These intrigues commenced\r\nseveral months before the Declaration of Independence, when the authors\r\nof it were disclaiming any wish or design to separate from England, and\r\ntheir desire for reconciliation with the mother country by a recognition\r\nof their rights as they existed in 1763. As early as December, 1775, six\r\nmonths before the Declaration of Independence, a Congress Secret\r\nCommittee of Correspondence wrote to Arthur Lee, in London (a native of\r\nVirginia, but a practising barrister in London), and Charles Dumas, at\r\nthe Hague, requesting them to ascertain the feeling of European Courts\r\nrespecting America, enjoining \"great circumspection and secrecy.\"[409]\r\nThey hoped most from France; but opposition was made in Congress when it\r\nwas first suggested to apply for aid to the ancient enemy both of the\r\ncolonies and England. Dr. Zubly, of Georgia, said: \"A proposal has been\r\nmade to apply to France and Spain. I apprehend the man who would propose\r\nit (to his constituents) would be torn to pieces like De Witt.\" Within\r\nthree months after the utterance of these words in Congress, M. de\r\nBouvouloir, agent of the French Government, appeared in Philadelphia,\r\nheld secret conferences with the Secret Committee, and assured them that\r\nFrance was ready to aid the colonies on such conditions as might be\r\nconsidered equitable. These conferences were so secret that De\r\nBouvouloir says that \"the Committee met him at an appointed place after\r\ndark, each going to it by a different road.\"[410]\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, the Secret Committee appointed Silas Deane commercial\r\nagent to Europe (March 3), to procure military supplies, and to state to\r\nthe French Minister, Count Vergennes, the probability of the colonies\r\ntotally separating from England; that France was looked upon as the\r\npower whose friendship they should most desire to cultivate; and to\r\ninquire whether, in case of their independence, France would acknowledge\r\nit, and receive their Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1776, three months before the Declaration of Independence, the\r\ninquiry was made of Franklin, \"When is the Continental Congress by\r\ngeneral consent to be formed into a Supreme Legislature?\" He replied,\r\n\"Nothing seems wanting but that general consent. The novelty of the\r\nthing deters some; the doubt of success, others; _the vain hope of\r\nreconciliation, many_. Every day furnishes us with new causes of\r\nincreasing enmity, and new reasons for _wishing an eternal separation_;\r\nso that there is a rapid increase of the _formerly small party_ who were\r\nfor an independent government.\"[411]\r\n\r\nFrom these words of Dr. Franklin, as well as from the facts stated in\r\nthe preceding pages, it is clear the Declaration of Independence was not\r\nthe spontaneous voice of a continent, as represented by many American\r\nhistorians, but the result of a persistent agitation on the part of the\r\nleaders in Congress, and their agents and partizans in the several\r\nprovinces, who _now_ represented every act of the corrupt Administration\r\nin England as the act of the _nation_, and thus sought to alienate the\r\naffections of the colonists from the mother country. Upon Dr. Franklin's\r\nown authority, it is clear that he was opposed to any reconciliation\r\nwith England and in favour of an \"eternal separation\" months before the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; that the party \"for an independent\r\ngovernment\" were \"the formerly small party,\" but had \"a rapid increase,\"\r\nwhich Dr. Franklin and his friends knew so well how to promote, while\r\nthey amused and deceived the friends of the unity of the empire, in\r\nboth England and America, by professing an earnest desire for\r\nreconciliation with the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe same double game was played against England by the French Government\r\nand the secret leaders of the American Congress, the latter professing a\r\ndesire for reconciliation with England, and the former professing the\r\nwarmest friendship for England and disapprobation of the separation of\r\nthe colonies from England, while both parties were secretly consulting\r\ntogether as to the means of dismembering the British empire. \"It was,\"\r\nsays Dr. Ramsay, \"evidently the interest of France to encourage the\r\nAmericans in their opposition to Great Britain; and it was true policy\r\nto do this by degrees, and in a private manner, lest Great Britain might\r\ntake the alarm. It is certain that Great Britain was amused with\r\ndeclarations of the most pacific disposition on the part of France, at\r\nthe time the Americans were liberally supplied with the means of\r\ndefence; and it is equally certain that this was the true line of policy\r\nfor promoting that dismemberment of the British empire which France had\r\nan interest in accomplishing. It was the interest of Congress to apply\r\nto the Court of France, and it was the interest of France to listen to\r\ntheir application.\"[412]\r\n\r\nThe application for alliance with France to war with England was far\r\nfrom being the voice of America. The fact that it was under discussion\r\nin Congress three months before it could be carried, shows how strong\r\nmust have been the opposition to it in Congress itself, and how vigorous\r\nand persevering must have been the efforts to manipulate a majority of\r\nits members into acquiescing in an application for arms, money, and men\r\nto a Government which was and had always been the enemy of civil and\r\nProtestant liberty--which had hired savage Indians to butcher and scalp\r\ntheir forefathers, mothers, and children, without regard to age or sex,\r\nand which had sought to destroy their very settlements, and drive them\r\ninto the sea, while the British Government had preserved them from\r\ndestruction and secured to them the American continent. It is easy to\r\nconceive how every British heart in America must have revolted at the\r\nidea of seeking to become brother warriors with the French against the\r\nmother country. Nor was the proceeding known in America until America\r\nwas committed to it, for the Congress made itself a secret conclave; its\r\nsittings were held in secret; no divisions were allowed to be recorded;\r\nits debates were suppressed; its members were sworn to secrecy; the\r\nminorities had no means of making known their views to the public; it\r\nwas decided by the majority that every resolution published should be\r\nreported as having been adopted _unanimously_, though actually carried\r\nby the slenderest majority. The proceedings of that elected Congress,\r\nwhich converted itself into a secret conclave, were never fully known\r\nuntil the present century, and many of them not until the present age,\r\nby the biographies of the men and the private correspondence of the\r\ntimes of the American Revolution. The United Empire Loyalists of those\r\ntimes were not permitted to speak for themselves, and their principles,\r\ncharacter and acts were only known from the pens of their adversaries.\r\nHad the heart of America been allowed to speak and act, there would have\r\nbeen no alliance of America, France, and Spain against England; the\r\nAmerican colonies would have achieved their own noblest freedom\r\nunstained by future bloodshed, and untainted by so unnatural an\r\nalliance; the Anglo-Saxon race and language would have been one, and\r\ngreatly more advanced than it now is in the cause of the world's freedom\r\nand civilization.\r\n\r\nHistory has justly censured, in the severest language, the conduct of\r\nLord North's Administration for employing German mercenaries to aid in\r\nmaintaining the assumed prerogative of King and Parliament in the\r\ncolonies; but was it less censurable and more patriotic for the\r\nadministrative leaders in Congress to engage French and Spanish forces,\r\nboth at sea and land, to invade Great Britain and her possessions, and\r\nto unite with Republicans for the dismemberment of the British empire?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: Judge Marshall's History of the American Colonies, Chap.\r\nXIV., pp. 449-451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: _Ib._, p. 457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: \"The commencement of hostilities on the 19th of April,\r\n1775, exhibited the parent State in an odious point of view. But,\r\nnevertheless, at that time, and for a twelvemonth after, a majority of\r\nthe colonists wished for no more than to be re-established as subjects\r\nin their ancient rights. Had independence been their object, even at the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, they would have rescinded the associations\r\nwhich have been already mentioned, and imported more largely than ever.\r\nCommon sense revolts at the idea that colonists, unfurnished with\r\nmilitary stores and wanting manufactures of every kind, should, at the\r\ntime of their intending a serious struggle for independence, by a\r\nvoluntary agreement, deprive themselves of the obvious means of\r\nprocuring such foreign supplies as their circumstances might make\r\nnecessary. Instead of pursuing a line of conduct which might have been\r\ndictated by a wish for independence, they continued their exports for\r\nnearly a year after they ceased to import. This not only lessened the\r\ndebts they owed to Great Britain, but furnished additional means for\r\ncarrying on war against themselves. To aim at independence, and at the\r\nsame time to transfer their resources to their enemies, could not have\r\nbeen the policy of an enlightened people. It was not till some time in\r\n1776 that the colonists began to take other ground, and contend that it\r\nwas for their interest to be for ever separated from Great Britain.\"\r\n(Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap, xii., pp.\r\n158, 159.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: Lord Mahon says: \"In framing this measure, he sought the\r\naid and counsel of Dr. Franklin. Already, in the month of August\r\npreceding, they had become acquainted, through the mediation of Lord\r\nStanhope, who carried Dr. Franklin to Hayes (the residence of Lord\r\nChatham). Lord Chatham had then referred to the idea which began to\r\n_prevail in England, that America aimed at setting up for herself as a\r\nseparate State. The truth of any such idea was loudly denied by Dr.\r\nFranklin_. 'I assured his lordship,' Dr. Franklin said, 'that having\r\nmore than once travelled almost from one end of the continent to the\r\nother, and kept a great variety of company, eating and drinking and\r\nconversing with them freely, I never had heard from any person, drunk or\r\nsober, the least expression of a wish for separation, or hint that such\r\na thing would be advantageous to America.... In fine, Lord Chatham\r\nexpressed much satisfaction in my having called upon him, _and\r\nparticularly in the assurances I had given him that America did not aim\r\nat independence_.'\" (Works, Vol. V., p. 7, ed. 1844.)\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Chatham's last speech was an appeal against the separation\r\nof the American colonies from England, and his last words were: \"My\r\nlords, I rejoice that the grave has not closed upon me; that I am still\r\nalive to lift up my voice against the dismemberment of this ancient and\r\nmost noble monarchy.\" (Bancroft, Vol. IX., p. 495.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: \"In the beginning of the memorable year 1776, there was a\r\npublic opinion in favour of independence in New England, and but little\r\nmore than individual preferences for it in the Middle or Southern\r\ncolonies. So deeply seated was the affection for the mother country,\r\nthat it required all the severe acts of war, directed by an inexorable\r\nMinistry and the fierce words from the throne, to be made fully known\r\nthroughout America before the _majority_ of the people could be\r\npersuaded to renounce their allegiance and assume the sovereignty.\r\nJefferson says that Samuel Adams was constantly holding caucuses with\r\ndistinguished men, in which the measures to be pursued were generally\r\ndetermined upon, and their several parts were assigned to the actors who\r\nafterwards appeared in them.\" (Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the\r\nUnited States, pp. 468, 469.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: Quoted by Bancroft, Vol. VII., p. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: \"Millions in England and Scotland\" (said John Adams, who\r\nnominated Washington as Commander-in-Chief, and was afterwards President\r\nof the United States)--\"millions in England and Scotland think it\r\nunrighteous, impolitic, and ruinous to make war upon us; and a Minister,\r\nthough he may have a marble heart, will proceed with a desponding\r\nspirit. London has bound her members under their hands to assist us;\r\nBristol has chosen two known friends of America; many of the most\r\nvirtuous of the nobility and gentry are for us, and among them a St.\r\nAsaph, a Camden, and a Chatham; the best bishop that adorns the bench,\r\nas great a judge as the nation can boast, and the greatest statesman it\r\never saw.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nxxi, p. 235.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: History of the American Revolution, Vol. I., Chap. xiii.,\r\np. 353.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: It was the plea then, as it had and has always been in\r\nall tyranny, whether wielded by an individual or an oligarchy or a\r\ncommittee, whether under the pretext of liberty or of order, to\r\npersecute all dissenting parties, under profession of preventing\r\ndivision and promoting unity. But the true friends of liberty, even in\r\nperilous times, have always relied upon the justice of their principles\r\nand excellence of their policy and measures for support and success, and\r\nnot upon the prison, the gallows, and the impoverishment of the\r\ndissenters by plunder. The Congress itself had declared to England that\r\nthe \"colonists were a unit\" in behalf of liberty; but their own\r\nenactments and proceedings against the Loyalists refuted their own\r\nstatements. Even in England, tyrannical and corrupt as was the\r\nGovernment at the time, and divided as were both Parliament and people,\r\nand assailed by foreign and domestic enemies, the proceedings of both\r\nHouses of Parliament were open to the public; every member was not only\r\nfree to express his opinions, but those opinions were forthwith\r\npublished to the world, and every man throughout the kingdom enjoyed\r\nfreedom of opinion. It was reserved for the American Congress, while\r\nprofessing to found liberty, to conduct its proceedings in secret for\r\neleven years, to suppress the freedom of the press and individual\r\nfreedom of opinion, and to treat as criminals those who dissented from\r\nits acts of policy.

One\r\nreason probably was, that in this division were the towns of New York\r\nand Philadelphia, which greatly profited by their trade to England, and\r\nwhich contained a larger proportion of English and Scotch merchants,\r\nwho, with few exceptions, were attached to the royal cause.\" (Tucker's\r\nHistory of the United States, Vol. I., p. 150.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: History of the United States, Vol. III., Chap. xxxiii.,\r\npp. 137, 138.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, 1776, about two weeks before adopting the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, Congress \"_Resolved_,--That no man in these\r\ncolonies charged with being a Tory, or unfriendly to the cause of\r\nAmerican liberty, be injured in his person or property, unless the\r\nproceeding against him be founded on an order of Congress or Committee,\"\r\netc. But this resolution amounted practically to nothing. It seems to\r\nhave been intended to allay the fears and weaken the opposition of\r\nloyalists, but contributed nothing for their protection, or to mitigate\r\nthe cruel persecutions everywhere waged against them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: Life and Correspondence of President Reed, Vol. I., p.\r\n195. Washington, however, in his public letter to Congress (unless Mr.\r\nJared Sparks has _improved_ this passage), says that the troops had\r\ntestified their \"warmest approbation.\" (Writings, Vol. III., p. 457.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: Lord Mahon's History of England from the Peace of\r\nUtrecht, Vol. VI., Chap. liv., pp. 161, 162.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon adds: \"It was at this inauspicious juncture, only a few hours\r\nafter independence had been proclaimed in the ranks of his opponents,\r\nthat the bearer of the pacific commission, Lord Howe, arrived off Sandy\r\nHook. He had cause to regret most bitterly both the delay of his passage\r\nand the limitation of his powers. He did not neglect, however, whatever\r\nmeans of peace were still within his reach. He sent on shore a\r\ndeclaration, announcing to the people the object of his mission. He\r\ndespatched a friendly letter, written at sea, to Dr. Franklin, at\r\nPhiladelphia. But when Franklin's answer came it showed him wholly\r\nadverse to a reconciliation, expressing in strong terms his resentment\r\nof the 'atrocious injuries' which, as he said, America had suffered from\r\n'your unformed and proud nation.' Lord Howe's next step was to send a\r\nflag of truce, with another letter, to Washington. But here a\r\npreliminary point of form arose. Lord Howe, as holding the King's\r\ncommission, could not readily acknowledge any rank or title not derived\r\nfrom his Majesty. He had therefore directed his letter to 'George\r\nWashington, Esq.' On the other hand, Washington, feeling that, in his\r\ncircumstances, to yield a punctilio would be to sacrifice a principle,\r\ndeclined to receive or open any letter not addressed to him as General.\r\nThus at the very outset this negotiation was cut short.\"--_Ib._, pp.\r\n162, 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: After the battle of Long Island and the evacuation of New\r\nYork, \"six thousand men, led by Earl Cornwallis, were landed on the\r\nJersey side. At their approach the Americans withdrew in great haste to\r\nFort Lee, leaving behind their artillery and stores. Washington himself\r\nhad no other alternative than to give way with all speed as his enemy\r\nadvanced. He fell back successively upon Brunswick, upon Princeton, upon\r\nTrenton, and at last to the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware. To all\r\nthese places, one after another, did Lord Cornwallis, though slowly, and\r\nwith little vigour, pursue him.\r\n\r\n\"This fair province of the Jerseys, sometimes called the Garden of\r\nAmerica, did not certainly on this occasion prove to be its bulwark. The\r\nscene is described as follows by one of their own historians, Dr.\r\nRamsay: 'As the retreating Americans marched through the country,\r\nscarcely one of the inhabitants joined them, while numbers were daily\r\nflocking to the royal army to make their peace and obtain protection.\r\nThey saw on the one side a numerous, well-appointed, and full-clad army,\r\ndazzling their eyes with their elegance of uniforms; on the other a few\r\npoor fellows who, from their shabby clothing, were called ragamuffins,\r\nfleeing for their safety. Not only the common people changed sides in\r\nthis gloomy state of public affairs, but some of the leading men in New\r\nJersey and Pennsylvania adopted the same expedient.'\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is scarcely just to the Americans to ascribe, with Dr. Ramsay,\r\ntheir change of sides to nothing beyond their change of fortune. May we\r\nnot rather believe that a feeling of concern at the separation, hitherto\r\nsuppressed in terror, was now first freely avowed--that in New Jersey,\r\nand not in New Jersey alone, an active and bold minority had been able\r\nto overrule numbers much larger, but more quiescent and complying?\r\n\r\n\"Another remark made by the same historian might, as history shows, be\r\nextended to other times and countries besides his own. The men who had\r\nbeen the vainest braggarts, the loudest blusterers in favour of\r\nindependence, were now the first to veer around or to slink away. This\r\nremark, which Dr. Ramsay makes only four years afterwards, is fully\r\nconfirmed by other documents of earlier date, but much later\r\npublication, by the secret correspondence of the time. Thus writes the\r\nAdjutant-General: 'Some of our Philadelphia gentlemen, who came over on\r\nvisits, upon the first cannon went off in a violent hurry. Your noisy\r\nSons of Liberty are, I find, the quietest in the field.' Thus again\r\nWashington, with felicitous expression, points a paragraph at the\r\n'chimney-corner heroes.'\r\n\r\n\"At this period the effective force under Washington had dwindled down\r\nto four thousand men.\r\n\r\n\"The Congress at this juncture, like most other public assemblies,\r\nseemed but slightly affected by the dangers which as yet were not close\r\nupon them. On the 11th of December they passed some resolutions\r\ncontradicting, as false and malicious, a report that they intended to\r\nremove from Philadelphia. They declared that they had a higher opinion\r\nof the good people of these States than to suppose such a measure\r\nrequisite, and that they would not leave the city of Philadelphia\r\n'unless the last necessity shall direct it.' These resolutions were\r\ntransmitted by the President to Washington, with a request that he would\r\npublish them to the army in General Orders. Washington, in reply,\r\nexcused himself from complying with that suggestion. In thus declining\r\nit, he showed his usual sagacity and foresight; for on the very next day\r\nafter the first resolution, the Congress underwent a sudden revulsion of\r\nopinion, and did not scruple to disperse in all haste, to meet again the\r\n20th of the same month, not at Philadelphia, but at Baltimore.\" (Lord\r\nMahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VI., Chap. liv., pp. 189-193.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: Dr. Andrews' History of the American War, etc., Vol.\r\nIII., Chap. xxxv., p. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: Frothingham's Rise of the American Republic, Chap. xii.,\r\np. 572.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: The Life of Arthur Lee (I., p. 53) contains the letter to\r\nLee, copied from the original MSS. in the handwriting of Franklin, dated\r\nDecember 12, 1775, and signed by Franklin, Dickenson, and Jay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Frothingham's Rise of the American Republic, Chap, xi.,\r\np. 488.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: Franklin to Josiah Quincy, April 15, 1776.

The discussion of this novel subject engaged their attention\r\ntill the latter end of September. Congress having agreed on the plan of\r\nthe treaty which they intended to propose to the King of France,\r\nproceeded to elect commissioners to solicit its acceptance. Dr.\r\nFranklin, Silas Deane, and Thomas Jefferson were chosen. The latter\r\ndeclining to serve, Arthur Lee, who was then in London, and had been\r\nvery serviceable to his country in a variety of ways, was elected in his\r\nroom. It was resolved that no member should be at liberty to divulge\r\nanything more of these transactions than 'that Congress had taken such\r\nsteps as they judged necessary for obtaining foreign alliances.'\"--_Ib._,\r\np., 242, 243.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that although Dr. Franklin consented to act as\r\none of the commissioners to France, he opposed the application itself;\r\nfor he himself wrote a few months afterwards as follows: \"I have never\r\nyet changed the opinions I gave in Congress, that a virgin state should\r\npreserve a virgin character, and not go about suitoring for alliances,\r\nbut wait with decent dignity for the applications of others.
