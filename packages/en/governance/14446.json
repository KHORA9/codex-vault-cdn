RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\nCOMPILED AND ARRANGED BY\r\n\r\nGEORGE RAYWOOD DEVITT, M.A.\r\n\r\nMEMBER NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY, ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\nTHIS VOLUME PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF BUREAU OF NATIONAL LITERATURE AND\r\nART\r\n\r\n1904\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\nAs the exigencies which prompted, at a late date, the change of plans\r\nin the compilation of this work, left the messages and papers of the\r\nMcKinley administration incomplete and defective, it has been felt that\r\nthe time has now arrived for their collection. In this supplement are\r\nincluded the messages, proclamations and executive orders of President\r\nMcKinley which do not appear in Volume X, and those of his successor,\r\nPresident Roosevelt, to date. They set forth the home affairs of the\r\nnation, and illustrate the stability of the government and institutions\r\nof the United States. They demonstrate that affairs were conducted with\r\nattention and directness unaffected by the apparently distracting, but\r\nglorious, incidents, which marked her interposition by arms and the\r\nextension of her sheltering aegis to Cuba. They teach us that the\r\nfoundations of this country are deep-rooted and that the process of\r\nnation-building, as recounted in these volumes, has proceeded upon\r\nright lines and with an unbounded fidelity to principle and purpose.\r\n\r\nGEORGE RAYWOOD DEVITT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _October 1, 1902._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1897, to September 14, 1901\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Messages, Proclamations, Executive Orders and Last Public\r\nUtterance to the People at Buffalo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\n\r\n(For portrait and early biographical sketch see Vol. X, pp. 125, 126,\r\n127)\r\n\r\nAt the National Republican Convention which met at Philadelphia in June,\r\n1901, William McKinley was again nominated the Republican candidate for\r\nthe Presidency of the United States. At the November election he was\r\nre-elected, receiving 292 electoral votes, against 155 votes for William\r\nJ. Bryan.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1901, he accepted an invitation to be present at the\r\nPan-American Exposition at Buffalo. On September 5 he delivered his\r\nlast public utterance to the people, in the Temple of Music, to a vast\r\naudience. The next day, returning from a short trip to Niagara Falls, he\r\nyielded to the wishes of the people and held a reception in the Temple.\r\nAmong those who, passing in single file, took him by the hand, was one\r\nwho approached with his hand wrapped and held to his breast as though\r\ninjured. Concealed within the covering was a loaded revolver; and as he\r\ngave his other hand to the President, a token of friendship, he quickly\r\nfired two shots, from the effects of which the President sank into the\r\narms of those near him. He was taken to the residence of Mr. John G.\r\nMilburn, President of the Exposition Company, where on September 14,\r\n1901, after an unexpected relapse, he died. The body was taken to\r\nWashington, D.C., and the state funeral was held in the rotunda of the\r\nCapitol. Thence the body was taken to his home in Canton, Ohio, for\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nThe period covered by the administration of William McKinley was,\r\nundoubtedly, more crowded with events calculated to try and to touch the\r\nvery heart of the nation than was any period since the Civil War. The\r\nUnited States has passed through crisis after crisis in quick succession\r\nand has emerged not only in safety but with untarnished honor, increased\r\nglory, and the great consciousness of solidarity and unification. This\r\nis attested by the wise management of affairs in connection with the\r\nNicaragua Canal; the increase of the navy, the formation of an army and\r\nthe imposition of taxes which in no way impeded the march of industry;\r\nthe settlement of railway claims; and the successful starting in life of\r\nCuba and the administration of far colonial affairs. Aside from the wise\r\ncounsels of the Executive of the nation, the calmness and cool action of\r\nthe people, amid distracting and perplexing events, have contributed to\r\nthe honor of the nation in no slight degree. All of this, and more, was\r\nabundantly testified to, at the time of the deplorable circumstances\r\nattending William McKinley's death by the unexampled outburst throughout\r\nthe world of sympathy with the bereaved nation and of admiration for the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the will of the people, and in their presence, by\r\nthe authority vested in me by this oath, I assume the arduous and\r\nresponsible duties of President of the United States, relying upon the\r\nsupport of my countrymen and invoking the guidance of Almighty God. Our\r\nfaith teaches that there is no safer reliance than upon the God of our\r\nfathers, who has so singularly favored the American people in every\r\nnational trial, and who will not forsake us so long as we obey His\r\ncommandments and walk humbly in His footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the high trust to which I have been\r\ncalled--always of grave importance--are augmented by the prevailing\r\nbusiness conditions, entailing idleness upon willing labor and\r\nloss to useful enterprises. The country is suffering from industrial\r\ndisturbances from which speedy relief must be had. Our financial system\r\nneeds some revision; our money is all good now, but its value must not\r\nfurther be threatened. It should all be put on an enduring basis, not\r\nsubject to easy attack, nor its stability to doubt or dispute. Our\r\ncurrency should continue under the supervision of the Government.\r\nThe several forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant\r\nembarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury.\r\nTherefore I believe it necessary to devise a system which, without\r\ndiminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its\r\ncontraction, will present a remedy for those arrangements which,\r\ntemporary in their nature, might well in the years of our prosperity\r\nhave been displaced by wiser provisions. With adequate revenue secured,\r\nbut not until then, we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as\r\nwill, while insuring safety and volume to our money, no longer impose\r\nupon the Government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold\r\nreserve, with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation.\r\nMost of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial,\r\nand should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of\r\nthe wisdom of the proposed changes. We must be both \"sure we are right,\"\r\nand \"make haste slowly.\" If, therefore, Congress, in its wisdom,\r\nshall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early\r\nconsideration the revision of our coinage, banking and currency laws,\r\nand give them that exhaustive, careful and dispassionate examination\r\nthat their importance demands, I shall cordially concur in such action.\r\nIf such power is vested in the President, it is my purpose to appoint\r\na commission of prominent, well-informed citizens of different parties,\r\nwho will command public confidence, both on account of their ability and\r\nspecial fitness for the work. Business experience and public training\r\nmay thus be combined, and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the\r\ncountry be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the\r\nsupport of all parties, and our finances cease to be the subject of mere\r\npartisan contention. The experiment is, at all events, worth a trial,\r\nand, in my opinion, it can but prove beneficial to the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest\r\nattention. It will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co-operation\r\nwith the other great commercial powers of the world. Until that\r\ncondition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money\r\nsprings from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals,\r\nthe value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter\r\nbe coined, must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at\r\nour command. The credit of the Government, the integrity of its\r\ncurrency, and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved.\r\nThis was the commanding verdict of the people, and it will not be\r\nunheeded.\r\n\r\nEconomy is demanded in every branch of the Government at all times, but\r\nespecially in periods, like the present, of depression in business and\r\ndistress among the people. The severest economy must be observed in all\r\npublic expenditures, and extravagance stopped wherever it is found, and\r\nprevented wherever in the future it may be developed. If the revenues\r\nare to remain as now, the only relief that can come must be from\r\ndecreased expenditures. But the present must not become the permanent\r\ncondition of the Government. It has been our uniform practice to retire,\r\nnot increase our outstanding obligations, and this policy must again be\r\nresumed and vigorously enforced. Our revenues should always be large\r\nenough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and\r\nthe principal and interest of the public debt, but to make proper and\r\nliberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors, the\r\nsoldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its\r\ndebt in times like the present. Suitably to provide against this is the\r\nmandate of duty--the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial\r\ndifficulties. A deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of\r\nthe Government exceed its receipts. It can only be met by loans or an\r\nincreased revenue. While a large annual surplus of revenue may invite\r\nwaste and extravagance, inadequate revenue creates distrust and\r\nundermines public and private credit. Neither should be encouraged.\r\nBetween more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion.\r\nWe should have more revenue, and that without delay, hindrance, or\r\npostponement. A surplus in the Treasury created by loans is not a\r\npermanent or safe reliance. It will suffice while it lasts, but it can\r\nnot last long while the outlays of the Government are greater than its\r\nreceipts, as has been the case during the past two years. Nor must\r\nit be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve\r\nthe situation, the Government is still indebted for the amount of the\r\nsurplus thus accrued, which it must ultimately pay, while its ability\r\nto pay is not strengthened, but weakened by a continued deficit. Loans\r\nare imperative in great emergencies to preserve the Government or its\r\ncredit, but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for\r\nthe maintenance of either has no justification.\r\n\r\nThe best way for the Government to maintain its credit is to pay as it\r\ngoes--not by resorting to loans, but by keeping out of debt--through an\r\nadequate income secured by a system of taxation, external or internal,\r\nor both. It is the settled policy of the Government, pursued from the\r\nbeginning and practised by all parties and Administrations, to raise the\r\nbulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the\r\nUnited States for sale and consumption, and avoiding, for the most part,\r\nevery form of direct taxation, except in time of war. The country is\r\nclearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal\r\ntaxation, and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system\r\nof tariff taxation. There can be no misunderstanding, either, about the\r\nprinciple upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied. Nothing has\r\never been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling\r\nprinciple in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous\r\ncare for American interests and American labor. The people have declared\r\nthat such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and\r\nencouragement to the industries and the development of our country.\r\nIt is, therefore, earnestly hoped and expected that Congress will, at\r\nthe earliest practicable moment, enact revenue legislation that shall\r\nbe fair, reasonable, conservative, and just, and which, while supplying\r\nsufficient revenue for public purposes, will still be signally\r\nbeneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the\r\npeople. To this policy we are all, of whatever party, firmly bound by\r\nthe voice of the people--a power vastly more potential than the\r\nexpression of any political platform. The paramount duty of Congress is\r\nto stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation\r\nwhich has always been the firmest prop of the Treasury. The passage of\r\nsuch a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the Government both\r\nat home and abroad, and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold\r\nreserve held for the redemption of our currency, which has been heavy\r\nand well-nigh constant for several years.\r\n\r\nIn the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given\r\nto the re-enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the\r\nlaw of 1890, under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign\r\ntrade in new and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and\r\nmanufactured products. The brief trial given this legislation amply\r\njustifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in\r\nthe making of commercial treaties, the end in view always to be the\r\nopening up of new markets for the products of our country, by granting\r\nconcessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot\r\nproduce ourselves, and which do not involve any loss of labor to our\r\nown people, but tend to increase their employment.\r\n\r\nThe depression of the past four years has fallen with especial\r\nseverity upon the great body of toilers of the country, and upon none\r\nmore than the holders of small farms. Agriculture has languished and\r\nlabor suffered. The revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both.\r\nNo portion of our population is more devoted to the institution of\r\nfree government nor more loyal in their support, while none bears\r\nmore cheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the\r\nGovernment or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and\r\nprotection. Legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all.\r\nThe depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and\r\nfactory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon\r\nthem, and they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue\r\nshall be established that will secure the largest income with the least\r\nburden, but that every means will be taken to decrease, rather than\r\nincrease, our public expenditures. Business conditions are not the most\r\npromising. It will take time to restore the prosperity of former years.\r\nIf we cannot promptly attain it, we can resolutely turn our faces in\r\nthat direction and aid its return by friendly legislation. However\r\ntroublesome the situation may appear, Congress will not, I am sure,\r\nbe found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as\r\nlegislation can do so. The restoration of confidence and the revival of\r\nbusiness, which men of all parties so much desire, depend more largely\r\nupon the prompt, energetic, and intelligent action of Congress than\r\nupon any other single agency affecting the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is inspiring, too, to remember that no great emergency in the one\r\nhundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen\r\nthat has not been met with wisdom and courage by the American people,\r\nwith fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny, and to the\r\nhonor of the American name. These years of glorious history have exalted\r\nmankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world, and\r\nimmeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy.\r\nThe people love and will sustain these institutions. The great essential\r\nto our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon\r\nwhich the Government was established and insist upon their faithful\r\nobservance. Equality of rights must prevail, and our laws be always and\r\neverywhere respected and obeyed. We may have failed in the discharge of\r\nour full duty as citizens of the great Republic, but it is consoling and\r\nencouraging to realize that free speech, a free press, free thought,\r\nfree schools, the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and\r\nworship, and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally\r\nenjoyed to-day than ever before. These guaranties must be sacredly\r\npreserved and wisely strengthened. The constituted authorities must be\r\ncheerfully and vigorously upheld. Lynchings must not be tolerated in a\r\ngreat and civilized country like the United States; courts, not mobs,\r\nmust execute the penalties of the law. The preservation of public order,\r\nthe right of discussion, the integrity of courts, and the orderly\r\nadministration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon\r\nwhich our Government securely rests.\r\n\r\nOne of the lessons taught by the late election, which all can rejoice\r\nin, is that the citizens of the United States are both law-respecting\r\nand law-abiding people, not easily swerved from the path of patriotism\r\nand honor. This is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions,\r\nand but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love\r\nfor law and order in the future. Immunity should be granted to none who\r\nviolate the laws, whether individuals, corporations, or communities; and\r\nas the Constitution imposes upon the President the duty of both its own\r\nexecution, and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions,\r\nI shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect. The declaration of\r\nthe party now restored to power has been in the past that of \"opposition\r\nto all combinations of capital organized in trusts, or otherwise, to\r\ncontrol arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens,\" and it\r\nhas supported \"such legislation as will prevent the execution of all\r\nschemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies, or by\r\nunjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market.\"\r\nThis purpose will be steadily pursued, both by the enforcement of the\r\nlaws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new\r\nstatutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to\r\nthe constant promotion of a safer, a better, and a higher citizenship.\r\nA grave peril to the Republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to\r\nunderstand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence\r\nof our institutions and laws, and against all who come here to make war\r\nupon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed. Nor must we be\r\nunmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens, but with\r\nthe zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free\r\neducation. Illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain\r\nthat high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the\r\nworld which, under Providence, we ought to achieve.\r\n\r\nReforms in the civil service must go on; but the changes should be real\r\nand genuine, not perfunctory, or prompted by a zeal in behalf of any\r\nparty simply because it happens to be in power. As a member of Congress\r\nI voted and spoke in favor of the present law, and I shall attempt its\r\nenforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted. The purpose in view\r\nwas to secure the most efficient service of the best men who would\r\naccept appointment under the Government, retaining faithful and devoted\r\npublic servants in office, but shielding none, under the authority of\r\nany rule or custom, who are inefficient, incompetent, or unworthy. The\r\nbest interests of the country demand this, and the people heartily\r\napprove the law wherever and whenever it has been thus administrated.\r\n\r\nCongress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our\r\nAmerican merchant marine, once the pride of the seas in all the great\r\nocean highways of commerce. To my mind, few more important subjects so\r\nimperatively demand its intelligent consideration. The United States\r\nhas progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and\r\nendeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines\r\nof inland trade, commerce, and industry. Yet, while this is true, our\r\nAmerican merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now\r\nlower, both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels\r\nemployed, than it was prior to the Civil War. Commendable progress has\r\nbeen made of late years in the upbuilding of the American Navy, but we\r\nmust supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a\r\nmerchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign\r\ncountries. The question is one that appeals both to our business\r\nnecessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the United States since the foundation of\r\nthe Government to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the\r\nnations of the world, and this accords with my conception of our duty\r\nnow. We have cherished the policy of non-interference with the affairs\r\nof foreign governments wisely inaugurated by Washington, keeping\r\nourselves free from entanglement, either as allies or foes, content\r\nto leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic\r\nconcerns. It will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign\r\npolicy, which shall be just, impartial, ever watchful of our national\r\nhonor, and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of\r\nAmerican citizens everywhere. Our diplomacy should seek nothing more and\r\naccept nothing less than is due us. We want no wars of conquest; we must\r\navoid the temptation of territorial aggression. War should never be\r\nentered upon until every agency of peace has failed; peace is preferable\r\nto war in almost every contingency. Arbitration is the true method of\r\nsettlement of international as well as local or individual differences.\r\nIt was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between\r\nemployers and employees by the Forty-ninth Congress, in 1886, and its\r\napplication was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous\r\nconcurrence of the Senate and House of the Fifty-first Congress in 1890.\r\nThe latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with\r\nus by the British House of Commons in 1893, and upon our invitation a\r\ntreaty of arbitration between the United States and Great Britain was\r\nsigned at Washington and transmitted to the Senate for its ratification\r\nin January last. Since this treaty is clearly the result of our own\r\ninitiative; since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our\r\nforeign policy throughout our entire national history--the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms--and since\r\nit presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace, not\r\npassion and war, controlling the relations between two of the greatest\r\nnations in the world, an example certain to be followed by others,\r\nI respectfully urge the early action of the Senate thereon, not merely\r\nas a matter of policy, but as a duty to mankind. The importance and\r\nmoral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be\r\noverestimated in the cause of advancing civilization. It may well engage\r\nthe best thought of the statesmen and people of every country, and I\r\ncannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the United\r\nStates to have the leadership in so grand a work.\r\n\r\nIt has been the uniform practice of each President to avoid, as far\r\nas possible, the convening of Congress in extraordinary session. It\r\nis an example which, under ordinary circumstances and in the absence\r\nof a public necessity, is to be commended. But a failure to convene\r\nthe representatives of the people in Congress in extra session when\r\nit involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of\r\nsuch neglect upon the Executive himself. The condition of the public\r\nTreasury, as has been indicated, demands the immediate consideration of\r\nCongress. It alone has the power to provide revenues for the Government.\r\nNot to convene it under such circumstances I can view in no other sense\r\nthan the neglect of a plain duty. I do not sympathize with the sentiment\r\nthat Congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests.\r\nIts members are the agents of the people, and their presence at the seat\r\nof Government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate\r\nas an injury, but a benefit. There could be no better time to put the\r\nGovernment upon a sound financial and economic basis than now. The\r\npeople have only recently voted that this should be done, and nothing\r\nis more binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of\r\nimmediate action. It has always seemed to me that the postponement of\r\nthe meeting of Congress until more than a year after it has been chosen\r\ndeprived Congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and\r\nthe country of the corresponding benefits. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would\r\nbe unwise on the part of the Executive because unjust to the interests\r\nof the people. Our action now will be freer from mere partisan\r\nconsideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed\r\nuntil the regular session of Congress. We are nearly two years from a\r\nCongressional election, and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if\r\nsuch contest was immediately pending. We can approach the problem calmly\r\nand patriotically, without fearing its effect upon an early election.\r\n\r\nOur fellow-citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this\r\nlegislation prefer to have the question settled now, even against their\r\npreconceived views, and perhaps settled so reasonably, as I trust and\r\nbelieve it will be, as to insure great permanence, than to have further\r\nuncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the\r\nUnited States. Again, whatever action Congress may take will be given a\r\nfair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment\r\nupon it, and this I consider a great essential to the rightful and\r\nlasting settlement of the question. In view of these considerations, I\r\nshall deem it my duty as President to convene Congress in extraordinary\r\nsession on Monday, the 15th day of March, 1897.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of\r\nthe people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent.\r\nThe recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the\r\nobliteration of sectional or geographical lines, but to some extent also\r\nthe prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred\r\nour true greatness as a nation. The triumph of the people, whose verdict\r\nis carried into effect to-day, is not the triumph of one section, nor\r\nwholly of one party, but of all sections and all the people. The North\r\nand the South no longer divide on the old lines, but upon principles and\r\npolicies; and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find\r\ncause for true felicitation. Let us rejoice in and cultivate this\r\nspirit; it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our\r\nbeloved country. It will be my constant aim to do nothing, and permit\r\nnothing to be done, that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment\r\nof unity and co-operation, this revival of esteem and affiliation which\r\nnow animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections,\r\nbut I shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLet me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the Chief\r\nJustice which, in their respective spheres, so far as applicable, I\r\nwould have all my countrymen observe: \"I will faithfully execute the\r\noffice of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my\r\nability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\" This is the obligation I have reverently taken before the Lord\r\nMost High. To keep it will be my single purpose, my constant prayer; and\r\nI shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the\r\npeople in the discharge of my solemn responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 15, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nRegretting the necessity which has required me to call you together,\r\nI feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable\r\nbecause of the condition in which we find the revenues of the\r\nGovernment. It is conceded that its current expenditures are greater\r\nthan its receipts, and that such a condition has existed for now more\r\nthan three years. With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting\r\nthe remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing\r\nmoney to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and\r\nprudent administration of the Government. An examination of the subject\r\ndiscloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the\r\nconclusion that the condition of the revenue which allows it is\r\nunjustifiable and should be corrected.\r\n\r\nWe find by the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury that the\r\nrevenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sources\r\nwere $425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were\r\n$415,953,806.56, leaving an excess of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$9,914,453.66. During that fiscal year $40,570,467.98 were paid upon the\r\npublic debt, which had been reduced since March 1, 1889, $259,076,890,\r\nand the annual interest charge decreased $11,684,576.60. The receipts\r\nof the Government from all sources during the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1893, amounted to $461,716,561.94, audits expenditures to\r\n$459,374,887.65, showing an excess of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$2,341,674.29.\r\n\r\nSince that time the receipts of no fiscal year, and with but few\r\nexceptions of no month of any fiscal year, have exceeded the\r\nexpenditures. The receipts of the Government, from all sources, during\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were $372,802,498.29, and its\r\nexpenditures $442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit, the first since the\r\nresumption of specie payments, of $69,803,260.58. Notwithstanding there\r\nwas a decrease of $16,769,128.78 in the ordinary expenses of the\r\nGovernment, as compared with the previous fiscal year, its income was\r\nstill not sufficient to provide for its daily necessities, and the gold\r\nreserve in the Treasury for the redemption of greenbacks was drawn upon\r\nto meet them. But this did not suffice, and the Government then resorted\r\nto loans to replenish the reserve.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1894, $50,000,000 in bonds were issued, and in November\r\nfollowing a second issue of $50,000,000 was deemed necessary. The sum of\r\n$117,171,795 was realized by the sale of these bonds, but the reserve\r\nwas steadily decreased until, on February 8, 1895, a third sale of\r\n$62,315,400 in bonds, for $65,116,244, was announced to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895,\r\nwere $390,373,203.30 and the expenditures $433,178,426.48, showing a\r\ndeficit of $42,805,223.18. A further loan of $100,000,000 was negotiated\r\nby the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $111,166,246,\r\nand swelling the aggregate of bonds issued within three years to\r\n$262,315,400. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the revenues of\r\nthe Government from all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78, while its\r\nexpenditures were $434,678,654.48, or an excess of expenditures over\r\nreceipts of $25,203,245.70. In other words, the total receipts for the\r\nthree fiscal years ending June 30, 1896, were insufficient by\r\n$137,811,729.46 to meet the total expenditures.\r\n\r\nNor has this condition since improved. For the first half of the present\r\nfiscal year, the receipts of the Government, exclusive of postal\r\nrevenues, were $157,507,603.76, and its expenditures, exclusive of\r\npostal service, $195,410,000.22, or an excess of expenditures over\r\nreceipts of $37,902,396.46. In January of this year, the receipts,\r\nexclusive of postal revenues, were $24,316,994.05, and the expenditures,\r\nexclusive of postal service, $30,269,389.29, a deficit of $5,952,395.24\r\nfor the month. In February of this year, the receipts, exclusive of\r\npostal revenues, were $24,400,997.38, and expenditures, exclusive of\r\npostal service, $28,796,056.66, a deficit of $4,395,059.28; or a total\r\ndeficiency of $186,061,580.44 for the three years and eight months\r\nending March 1, 1897. Not only are we without a surplus in the Treasury,\r\nbut with an increase in the public debt there has been a corresponding\r\nincrease in the annual interest charge, from $22,893,883.20 in 1892, the\r\nlowest of any year since 1862, to $34,387,297.60 in 1896, or an increase\r\nof $11,493,414.40.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been\r\nsufficient to meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three\r\nyears, the gold reserve would still have been insufficient to meet the\r\ndemands upon it, and that bonds would necessarily have been issued for\r\nits repletion. Be this as it may, it is clearly manifest, without\r\ndenying or affirming the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt\r\nwould have been decreased in at least the amount of the deficiency, and\r\nbusiness confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the country.\r\n\r\nCongress should promptly correct the existing condition. Ample revenues\r\nmust be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government,\r\nbut for the prompt payment of liberal pensions and the liquidation of\r\nthe principal and interest of the public debt. In raising revenue,\r\nduties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home\r\nmarket, so far as possible, to our own producers; to revive and increase\r\nmanufactures; to relieve and encourage agriculture; to increase our\r\ndomestic and foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building;\r\nand to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal\r\nwages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly\r\nentitled. The necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall\r\nprovide ample revenue, need not be further urged. The imperative demand\r\nof the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this\r\nobject I earnestly recommend that Congress shall make every endeavor.\r\nBefore other business is transacted, let us first provide sufficient\r\nrevenue to faithfully administer the Government without the contracting\r\nof further debt, or the continued disturbance of our finances.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 7, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nInformation which has recently come to me from the governors of\r\nArkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and from prominent citizens of\r\nthese States and Tennessee, warrants the conclusion that widespread\r\ndistress, involving the destruction of a large amount of property and\r\nloss of human life, has resulted from the floods which have submerged\r\nthat section of the country. These are stated, on reliable authority, to\r\nbe the most destructive floods that have ever devastated the Mississippi\r\nValley, the water being much higher than the highest stage it has\r\nreached before. From Marion, Ark., north of Memphis, to Greenville,\r\nMiss., a distance of more than 250 miles by river, it is reported there\r\nare now at least fifty towns and villages under water, and a territory\r\nextending from 100 miles north of Memphis to 200 miles south, and from\r\n5 to 40 miles wide, is submerged. Hundreds of thousands of acres of\r\ncultivated soil, with growing crops, are included in the submerged\r\nterritory. In this section alone there are from 50,000 to 60,000 people\r\nwhose property has been destroyed and whose business has been suspended.\r\nGrowing crops have been ruined, thousands of cattle have been drowned,\r\nand the inhabitants of certain areas threatened with starvation. As a\r\ngreat majority of the sufferers are small farmers, they have thus been\r\nleft entirely destitute, and will be unprepared for work even after the\r\nfloods have subsided.\r\n\r\nThe entire Mississippi Valley in Arkansas is flooded and communication\r\nwith many points cut off. In Mississippi a like condition exists. The\r\nlevees in Louisiana, with a single exception, have held; but the water\r\nis rising and the situation there is reported as being extremely\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the citizens of these States look for the\r\nco-operation and support of the National Government in relieving the\r\npressing cases of destitution for food, clothing, and shelter, which are\r\nbeyond the reach of local efforts. The authorities who have communicated\r\nwith the Executive recognize that their first and most energetic duty\r\nis to provide as far as possible the means of caring for their own\r\ncitizens; but nearly all of them agree in the opinion that after their\r\nresources have been exhausted a sum aggregating at least $150,000 and\r\npossibly $200,000 will be required for immediate use.\r\n\r\nPrecedents are not wanting that in such emergencies as this Congress\r\nhas taken prompt, generous, and intelligent action, involving the\r\nexpenditure of considerable sums of money, with satisfactory results.\r\nIn 1874 $590,000 was appropriated, and in 1882 $350,000 was also\r\nappropriated for relief in same direction, besides large sums in other\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe citizens' relief committee of Memphis has taken prompt action,\r\nhas already cared for from 6,000 to 7,000 refugees from the flooded\r\ndistricts, and they are still arriving in that city in large numbers\r\ndaily. Supplies and provisions have been sent to the various points in\r\nArkansas and Mississippi by this committee, but the utmost that can be\r\ndone by these efforts is to partly relieve the most acute cases of\r\nsuffering. No action has yet been taken for the great majority of the\r\ninhabitants living in the interior, whose condition has already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions and having exerted themselves to the fullest\r\nextent, the local authorities have reluctantly confessed their inability\r\nto further cope with this distressing situation unaided by relief from\r\nthe Government. It has therefore seemed to me that the representatives\r\nof the people should be promptly informed of the nature and extent\r\nof the suffering and needs of these stricken people, and I have\r\ncommunicated these facts in the hope and belief that the legislative\r\nbranch of the Government will promptly re-enforce the work of the local\r\nauthorities in the States named.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 14, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith for the consideration of the respective Houses\r\nof the Congress, a report of the Secretary of State representing the\r\nappropriateness of early action in order that the Government of the\r\nUnited States may be enabled to accept the invitation of that of the\r\nFrench Republic to participate in the Universal Exposition to be held\r\nat Paris in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of this report have my most cordial approval,\r\nand I urge upon the Congress such timely provision for this great\r\ninternational enterprise as will fittingly respond to the widely\r\ntestified wish and expectation of our inventors and producers that they\r\nmay have adequate opportunity again, as in the past, to fortify the\r\nimportant positions that have won in the world's competitive fields\r\nof discovery and industry. Nor are the traditional friendships of the\r\nUnited States and France and the mutual advantages to accrue from\r\ntheir enlarged commercial intercourse less important factors than the\r\nindividual interests to be fostered by renewed participation in a great\r\nFrench exposition, especially when it is remembered that the present\r\ndisplay is projected with a degree of completeness and on a scale of\r\nmagnificence beyond any of the European exhibitions that have marked\r\nthe close of the century.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that I should emphasize the need of early action, for if\r\nthe present session pass without suitable provision being made, the\r\npostponement of the matter for nearly a year longer could not but\r\noperate greatly to the disadvantage of the United States, in view of the\r\nelaborate preparations already making by other governments, and of the\r\ndanger that further delay may result in an inadequate allotment of space\r\nto this country as well as an incomplete organization of the American\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 3, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State reciting the\r\ncircumstances attending the lynching at Hahnville, La., on the night\r\nof August 8, 1896, of three Italian subjects, named Salvatore Arena,\r\nGiuseppe Venturelia, and Lorenzo Salardino, and I recommend the\r\nappropriation by Congress, without admitting the liability of the\r\nGovernment of the United States in the premises, of the sum of $6,000,\r\nto be paid by the Secretary of State to the Government of Italy, and to\r\nbe distributed by that government in such manner as it may deem proper\r\namong the heirs of the three Italian subjects above named.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 13, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the Senate resolution of April 22,\r\n1897, addressed to the Secretary of State, a report from that officer\r\nrelative to diplomatic and consular reports on postal savings banks\r\nsystems in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 17, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOfficial information from our consuls in Cuba establishes the fact that\r\na large number of American citizens in the island are in a state of\r\ndestitution, suffering for want of food and medicines. This applies\r\nparticularly to the rural districts of the central and eastern parts.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural classes have been forced from their farms into\r\nthe nearest towns, where they are without work or money. The local\r\nauthorities of the several towns, however kindly disposed, are unable to\r\nrelieve the needs of their own people, and are altogether powerless to\r\nhelp our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe latest report of Consul-General Lee estimates six to eight\r\nhundred Americans are without means of support. I have assured him that\r\nprovision would be made at once to relieve them. To that end I recommend\r\nthat Congress make an appropriation of not less than $50,000, to be\r\nimmediately available for use, under the direction of the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that a part of the sum which may be appropriated by\r\nCongress should, in the discretion of the Secretary of State, also be\r\nused for the transportation of American citizens who, desiring to return\r\nto the United States, are without means to do so.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 1, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 15th ultimo all the buildings of the immigration station at Ellis\r\nIsland, New York, excepting the heating plant and lighting apparatus,\r\nwere destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, which\r\nstates the fact and explains the need of rebuilding.\r\n\r\nIn order that there may be no delay in this important work, I recommend\r\nthat an appropriation be made at once of $600,000, the sum estimated by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury as required for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 23, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Acting Secretary of State, with an\r\naccompanying paper, in response to the resolution of the Senate of July\r\n12, 1897, requesting the Secretary of State to send to the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of the United States abroad a circular letter, similar\r\nto the one sent by Secretary Elaine on May 20, 1881, instructing them to\r\nobtain from the several foreign governments to which they are accredited\r\nas full information as possible (including copy of laws relating\r\nthereto) as to the nature and practical workings (including expenses,\r\nreceipts, and rates) of the postal telegraphs, telephones, and postal\r\nsavings banks of such countries as have adopted the same.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 24, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my message convening the Congress in extraordinary session I called\r\nattention to a single subject--that of providing revenue adequate to\r\nmeet the reasonable and proper expenses of the Government. I believed\r\nthat to be the most pressing subject for settlement then. A bill to\r\nprovide the necessary revenues for the Government has already passed the\r\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate and awaits executive action.\r\n\r\nAnother question of very great importance is that of the establishment\r\nof our currency and banking system on a better basis, which I commented\r\nupon in my inaugural address in the following words:\r\n\r\n  Our financial system needs some revision; our money is all good now,\r\n  but its value must not further be threatened. It should all be put upon\r\n  an enduring basis, not subject to easy attack, nor its stability to\r\n  doubt or dispute. The several forms of our paper money offer, in my\r\n  judgment, a constant embarrassment to the Government and imperil a safe\r\n  balance in the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing was settled more clearly at the late national election than the\r\ndetermination upon the part of the people to keep their currency stable\r\nin value and equal to that of the most advanced nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe soundness of our currency is nowhere questioned. No loss can occur\r\nto its holders. It is the system which should be simplified and\r\nstrengthened, keeping our money just as good as it is now with less\r\nexpense to the Government and the people.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the country is strongly in favor of early action\r\nby Congress in this direction, to revise our currency laws and remove\r\nthem from partisan contention. A notable assembly of business men\r\nwith delegates from twenty-nine States and Territories was held at\r\nIndianapolis in January of this year. The financial situation commanded\r\ntheir earnest attention, and after a two days' session the convention\r\nrecommended to Congress the appointment of a monetary commission.\r\n\r\nI recommend this report to the consideration of Congress. The authors of\r\nthe report recommend a commission \"to make a thorough investigation of\r\nthe monetary affairs and needs of this country in all relations and\r\naspects, and to make proper suggestions as to any evils found to exist\r\nand the remedies therefor.\"\r\n\r\nThis subject should receive the attention of Congress at its special\r\nsession. It ought not to be postponed until the regular session.\r\n\r\nI therefore urgently recommend that a special commission be created,\r\nnon-partisan in its character, to be composed of well-informed citizens\r\nof different parties who will command the confidence of Congress and the\r\ncountry because of their special fitness for the work, whose duty it\r\nshall be to make recommendations of whatever changes in our present\r\nbanking and currency laws may be found necessary and expedient, and to\r\nreport their conclusions on or before the 1st day of November next, in\r\norder that the same may be transmitted by me to Congress for its\r\nconsideration at its first regular session.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the report thus made will be so comprehensive and\r\nsound as to receive the support of all parties and the favorable action\r\nof Congress. At all events, such a report cannot fail to be of value to\r\nthe executive branch of the Government, as well as to those charged with\r\npublic legislation, and to greatly assist in the establishment of an\r\nimproved system of finance.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 6, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to extend greeting to the Fifty-fifth Congress,\r\nassembled in regular session at the seat of Government, with many\r\nof whose Senators and Representatives I have been associated in the\r\nlegislative service. Their meeting occurs under felicitous conditions,\r\njustifying sincere congratulation and calling for our grateful\r\nacknowledgment to a beneficent Providence which has so signally blessed\r\nand prospered us as a nation. Peace and good will with all the nations\r\nof the earth continue unbroken.\r\n\r\nA matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal\r\nregard and unification of all sections of our country, the\r\nincompleteness of which has too long delayed realization of the highest\r\nblessings of the Union. The spirit of patriotism is universal and is\r\never increasing in fervor. The public questions which now most engross\r\nus are lifted far above either partisanship, prejudice, or former\r\nsectional differences. They affect every part of our common country\r\nalike and permit of no division on ancient lines. Questions of foreign\r\npolicy, of revenue, the soundness of the currency, the inviolability of\r\nnational obligations, the improvement of the public service, appeal to\r\nthe individual conscience of every earnest citizen to whatever party he\r\nbelongs or in whatever section of the country he may reside.\r\n\r\nThe extra session of this Congress which closed during July last\r\nenacted important legislation, and while its full effect has not yet\r\nbeen realized, what it has already accomplished assures us of its\r\ntimeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be\r\nrequired, and the people, satisfied with its operation and results thus\r\nfar, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial.\r\n\r\nTariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress,\r\nthe question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency.\r\n\r\nThe work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as\r\nit may seem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations\r\nof the Government since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year\r\nwe had outstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $728,868,447.41.\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to\r\n$443,889,495.88. Of our interest-bearing obligations, the figures\r\nare even more striking. On July 1, 1866, the principal of the\r\ninterest-bearing debt of the Government was $2,332,331,208. On the\r\n1st day of July, 1893, this sum had been reduced to $585,037,100, or an\r\naggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The interest-bearing debt of the\r\nUnited States on the 1st day of December, 1897, was $847,365,620. The\r\nGovernment money now outstanding (December 1) consists of $346,681,016\r\nof United States notes, $107,793,280 of Treasury notes issued by\r\nauthority of the law of 1890, $384,963,504 of silver certificates, and\r\n$61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.\r\n\r\nWith the great resources of the Government, and with the honorable\r\nexample of the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a\r\ncurrency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to\r\nthe Government and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt.\r\n\r\nThe brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war\r\nto 1893, makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our\r\nfinancial ability or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897\r\nmust admonish Congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as\r\nto make the return of the conditions then prevailing impossible.\r\n\r\nThere are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can\r\nfind the true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that\r\nour currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good;\r\ngood because the Government's pledge is out to keep it so, and that\r\npledge will not be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep\r\nthe pledge will be best shown by advancing toward its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the\r\nGovernment of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money,\r\nthat is, keeping all of them at par with gold. We surely cannot be\r\nlonger heedless of the burden this imposes upon the people, even under\r\nfairly prosperous conditions, while the past four years have\r\ndemonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the\r\nGovernment, but a dangerous menace to the National credit.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the Government\r\nagainst bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the\r\nopportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions\r\nof our demand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their\r\nredemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the Government by\r\nsolemn enactment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is\r\nobliged to redeem in gold but the Government. The banks are not required\r\nto redeem in gold. The Government is obliged to keep equal with gold all\r\nits outstanding currency and coin obligations, while its receipts are\r\nnot required to be paid in gold. They are paid in every kind of money\r\nbut gold, and the only means by which the Government can with certainty\r\nget gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most\r\nneeds it. The Government without any fixed gold revenue is pledged to\r\nmaintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done,\r\nand which, under the authority now given, it will continue to do.\r\n\r\nThe law which requires the Government, after having redeemed its United\r\nStates notes, to pay them out again as current funds, demands a constant\r\nreplenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so in times of\r\nbusiness panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the\r\nexpenses of the Government. At such times the Government has no other\r\nway to supply its deficit and maintain redemption but through the\r\nincrease of its bonded debt, as during the Administration of my\r\npredecessor, when $262,315,400 of four-and-a-half per cent bonds were\r\nissued and sold and the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the\r\nGovernment in excess of the revenues and sustain the gold reserve. While\r\nit is true that the greater part of the proceeds of these bonds were\r\nused to supply deficient revenues, a considerable portion was required\r\nto maintain the gold reserve.\r\n\r\nWith our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficit\r\nrequiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below\r\n$100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds?\r\nIs there any other way practicable under existing law? The serious\r\nquestion then is, Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in\r\nthe past; that is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger,\r\nissue more bonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other\r\nmeans to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no\r\nfurther legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be\r\ncontinued, then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nauthority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of\r\ninterest than is now authorized by law.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the Government are\r\nquite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, that when\r\nany of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and\r\nare redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only\r\npaid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of\r\nthe United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government,\r\nhe should not receive back from the Government a United States note\r\nwithout paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made\r\nall the more apparent when the Government issues an interest-bearing\r\ndebt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes--a\r\nnon-interest-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again\r\nexcept on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way,\r\nthey may return again to be followed by another bond issue to redeem\r\nthem--another interest-bearing debt to redeem a non-interest-bearing\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nIn my view, it is of the utmost importance that the Government\r\nshould be relieved from the burden of providing all the gold required\r\nfor exchanges and export. This responsibility is alone borne by the\r\nGovernment, without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to\r\nhelp itself. The banks do not feel the strain of gold redemption. The\r\nwhole strain rests upon the Government, and the size of the gold reserve\r\nin the Treasury has come to be, with or without reason, the signal of\r\ndanger or of security. This ought to be stopped.\r\n\r\nIf we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient\r\nreceipts for the expenses of the Government, we may feel no immediate\r\nembarrassment from our present currency; but the danger still exists,\r\nand will be ever present, menacing us so long as the existing system\r\ncontinues. And, besides, it is in times of adequate revenues and\r\nbusiness tranquillity that the Government should prepare for the worst.\r\nWe cannot avoid, without serious consequences, the wise consideration\r\nand prompt solution of this question.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan, in great detail, for\r\nthe purpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold\r\nreserve and save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this\r\nplan I invite your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in his recommendation that\r\nNational banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds\r\nwhich they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on\r\ncirculating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to\r\none-half of one per cent per annum. I also join him in recommending that\r\nauthority be given for the establishment of National banks with a\r\nminimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and\r\nagricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the issue of National bank notes be restricted to the\r\ndenomination of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have\r\nherein made shall have the approval of Congress, then I would recommend\r\nthat National banks be required to redeem their notes in gold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n           [See Vol. X, pp. 127-136.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of\r\nwhom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate\r\nwhether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to\r\nthe Cubans and to Spain as well as equitable to all our interests so\r\nintimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If\r\nnot, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will\r\nremain to be taken. When that time comes that action will be determined\r\nin the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without\r\nmisgiving or hesitancy in the light of the obligation this Government\r\nowes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of\r\ntheir interests and honor, and to humanity.\r\n\r\nSure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated\r\nonly by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion\r\nnor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over\r\nthe rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of\r\nits efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall\r\nbe honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty\r\nimposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity\r\nto intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only\r\nbecause the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the\r\nsupport and approval of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nBy a special message dated the 16th day of June last, I laid before\r\nthe Senate a treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nUnited States and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose\r\nthe incorporation of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the\r\nUnited States and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the\r\ninjunction of secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that\r\nbody, the subject may be properly referred to in this Message because\r\nthe necessary action of the Congress is required to determine by\r\nlegislation many details of the eventual union should the fact of\r\nannexation be accomplished, as I believe it should be.\r\n\r\nWhile consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive\r\npolicy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of\r\ndeclarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the\r\nvital interest of the United States in the independent life of the\r\nIslands and their intimate commercial dependence upon this country. At\r\nthe same time it has been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the\r\nentity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the passage of the Islands under\r\nthe domination or influence of another power than the United States.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the logic of events required that annexation,\r\nheretofore offered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come\r\nabout as the natural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to\r\nthose Islands, and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian State.\r\n\r\nThat treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the Senate and\r\nPresident of the Republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and\r\nonly awaits the favorable action of the American Senate to effect the\r\ncomplete absorption of the Islands into the domain of the United States.\r\nWhat the conditions of such a union shall be, the political relation\r\nthereof to the United States, the character of the local administration,\r\nthe quality and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the\r\nextension of the federal laws to the territory or the enactment of\r\nspecial laws to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the regulation if\r\nneed be of the labor system therein, are all matters which the treaty\r\nhas wisely relegated to the Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor\r\nrequires, the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt\r\nassimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the\r\nhighest franchises of citizenship, and having due regard to the\r\ngeographical conditions, the most just provisions for self-rule in local\r\nmatters with the largest political liberties as an integral part of our\r\nNation will be accorded to the Hawaiians. No less is due to a people\r\nwho, after nearly five years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the\r\nobligations of self-governing statehood, come of their free will to\r\nmerge their destinies in our body-politic.\r\n\r\nThe questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by reason of\r\nthe treatment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the Islands under the\r\nHawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage of\r\nsettlement by negotiation. This Government has not been invited to\r\nmediate, and on the other hand has sought no intervention in that\r\nmatter, further than to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a\r\nspeedy and direct adjustment by the two sovereign States in interest as\r\nshall comport with equity and honor. It is gratifying to learn that the\r\napprehensions at first displayed on the part of Japan lest the cessation\r\nof Hawaii's national life through annexation might impair privileges to\r\nwhich Japan honorably laid claim, have given place to confidence in the\r\nuprightness of this Government, and in the sincerity of its purpose to\r\ndeal with all possible ulterior questions in the broadest spirit of\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\nAs to the representation of this Government to Nicaragua, Salvador, and\r\nCosta Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, confirmed as\r\nminister of the United States to the States of Nicaragua, Salvador and\r\nCosta Rica, shall proceed to San José, Costa Rica, and there temporarily\r\nestablish the headquarters of the United States to those three States.\r\nI took this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of\r\nthis country. It was developed upon an investigation by the Secretary of\r\nState that the Government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to receive\r\nMr. Merry in his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of the\r\ncompact concluded June 20, 1895, whereby that Republic and those of\r\nSalvador and Honduras, forming what is known as the Greater Republic of\r\nCentral America, had surrendered to the representative Diet thereof\r\ntheir right to receive and send diplomatic agents. The Diet was not\r\nwilling to accept him because he was not accredited to that body. I\r\ncould not accredit him to that body because the appropriation law of\r\nCongress did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the present minister at Managua,\r\nhas been directed to present his letters of recall.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the Governments\r\nof Guatemala and Honduras, the same as his predecessor. Guatemala is not\r\na member of the Greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is.\r\nShould this latter Government decline to receive him, he has been\r\ninstructed to report this fact to his Government and await its further\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nA subject of large importance to our country, and increasing\r\nappreciation on the part of the people, is the completion of the great\r\nhighway of trade between the Atlantic and Pacific, known as the\r\nNicaragua Canal. Its utility and value to American commerce is\r\nuniversally admitted. The Commission appointed under date of July 24\r\nlast \"to continue the surveys and examinations authorized by the act\r\napproved March 2, 1895,\" in regard to \"the proper route, feasibility,\r\nand cost of construction of the Nicaragua Canal, with a view of making\r\ncomplete plans for the entire work of construction of such canal,\" is\r\nnow employed in the undertaking. In the future I shall take occasion to\r\ntransmit to Congress the report of this Commission, making at the same\r\ntime such further suggestions as may then seem advisable.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897,\r\nfor the promotion of an international agreement respecting bimetallism,\r\nI appointed on the 14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of\r\nColorado, Hon. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine\r\nof Massachusetts, as special envoys to represent the United States.\r\nThey have been diligent in their efforts to secure the concurrence and\r\ncooperation of European countries in the international settlement of the\r\nquestion, but up to this time have not been able to secure an agreement\r\ncontemplated by their mission.\r\n\r\nThe gratifying action of our great sister Republic of France in joining\r\nthis country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the\r\nprincipal commercial nations of Europe, whereby a fixed and relative\r\nvalue between gold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that\r\nwe are not alone among the larger nations of the world in realizing the\r\ninternational character of the problem and in the desire of reaching\r\nsome wise and practical solution of it. The British Government has\r\npublished a _résumé_ of the steps taken jointly by the French\r\nambassador in London and the special envoys of the United States, with\r\nwhom our ambassador at London actively co-operated in the presentation\r\nof this subject to Her Majesty's Government. This will be laid before\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nOur special envoys have not made their final report, as further\r\nnegotiations between the representatives of this Government and the\r\nGovernments of other countries are pending and in contemplation.\r\nThey believe that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters\r\nrespecting the position of maintaining the stability of the parity\r\nbetween the metals and kindred questions may yet be solved by further\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have\r\nalready demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject,\r\nand it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an\r\ninternational agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold\r\nand silver as money upon such terms, and with such safeguards as will\r\nsecure the use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice\r\nto any class of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn order to execute as early as possible the provisions of the third and\r\nfourth sections of the Revenue Act, approved July 24, 1897, I appointed\r\nthe Hon. John A. Kasson of Iowa, a special commissioner plenipotentiary\r\nto undertake the requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring\r\nto avail themselves of these provisions. The negotiations are now\r\nproceeding with several Governments, both European and American. It is\r\nbelieved that by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by that Act\r\nsome grievances of our own and of other countries in our mutual trade\r\nrelations may be either removed, or largely alleviated, and that the\r\nvolume of our commercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to\r\nboth contracting parties.\r\n\r\nMost desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism\r\nis the effort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant\r\nmarine should be improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of\r\nthe carrying trade of the world. We do not do it now. We should be the\r\nlaggard no longer. The inferiority of our merchant marine is justly\r\nhumiliating to the national pride. The Government by every proper\r\nconstitutional means, should aid in making our ships familiar visitors\r\nat every commercial port of the world, thus opening up new and valuable\r\nmarkets to the surplus products of the farm and the factory.\r\n\r\nThe efforts which had been made during the two previous years by my\r\npredecessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the North\r\nPacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were renewed at an early date by this\r\nAdministration, and have been pursued with earnestness. Upon my\r\ninvitation, the Governments of Japan and Russia sent delegates to\r\nWashington, and an international conference was held during the months\r\nof October and November last, wherein it was unanimously agreed that\r\nunder the existing regulations this species of useful animals was\r\nthreatened with extinction, and that an international agreement of all\r\nthe interested powers was necessary for their adequate protection.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain did not see proper to be represented at\r\nthis conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, as delegates, the\r\nexpert commissioners of Great Britain and Canada who had, during the\r\npast two years, visited the Pribilof Islands, and who met in conference\r\nsimilar commissioners on the part of the United States. The result of\r\nthis conference was an agreement on important facts connected with the\r\ncondition of the seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which should place\r\nbeyond controversy the duty of the Governments concerned to adopt\r\nmeasures without delay for the preservation and restoration of the herd.\r\nNegotiations to this end are now in progress, the result of which I hope\r\nto be able to report to Congress at an early day.\r\n\r\nInternational arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects\r\nclaiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the\r\ngeneral views on this question expressed in my inaugural address. The\r\nbest sentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settlement\r\nof differences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war.\r\nTreaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without in\r\nany way imperiling our interests or our honor, shall have my constant\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance by this Government of the invitation of the Republic of\r\nFrance to participate in the Universal Exposition of 1900, at Paris, was\r\nimmediately followed by the appointment of a special commissioner to\r\nrepresent the United States in the proposed exposition, with special\r\nreference to the securing of space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe special commissioner delayed his departure for Paris long enough\r\nto ascertain the probable demand for space by American exhibitors. His\r\ninquiries developed an almost unprecedented interest in the proposed\r\nexposition, and the information thus acquired enabled him to justify\r\nan application for a much larger allotment of space for the American\r\nsection than had been reserved by the exposition authorities. The result\r\nwas particularly gratifying, in view of the fact that the United States\r\nwas one of the last countries to accept the invitation of France.\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded our special commissioner was most cordial,\r\nand he was given every reasonable assurance that the United States\r\nwould receive a consideration commensurate with the proportions of our\r\nexhibit. The report of the special commissioner as to the magnitude\r\nand importance of the coming exposition, and the great demand for\r\nspace by American exhibitors, supplies new arguments for a liberal\r\nand judicious appropriation by Congress, to the end that an exhibit\r\nfairly representative of the industries and resources of our country may\r\nbe made in an exposition which will illustrate the world's progress\r\nduring the nineteenth century. That exposition is intended to be the\r\nmost important and comprehensive of the long series of international\r\nexhibitions, of which our own at Chicago was a brilliant example, and\r\nit is desirable that the United States should make a worthy exhibit of\r\nAmerican genius and skill and their unrivaled achievements in every\r\nbranch of industry.\r\n\r\nThe present immediately effective force of the Navy consists of four\r\nbattle ships of the first class, two of the second, and forty-eight\r\nother vessels, ranging from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are\r\nunder construction five battle ships of the first class, sixteen torpedo\r\nboats, and one submarine boat. No provision has yet been made for the\r\narmor of three of the five battle ships, as it has been impossible to\r\nobtain it at the price fixed by Congress. It is of great importance that\r\nCongress provide this armor, as until then the ships are of no fighting\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe present naval force, especially in view of its increase by the\r\nships now under construction, while not as large as that of a few other\r\npowers, is a formidable force; its vessels are the very best of each\r\ntype; and with the increase that should be made to it from time to time\r\nin the future, and careful attention to keeping it in a high state of\r\nefficiency and repair, it is well adapted to the necessities of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe great increase of the Navy which has taken place in recent years was\r\njustified by the requirements for national defense, and has received\r\npublic approbation. The time has now arrived, however, when this\r\nincrease, to which the country is committed, should, for a time, take\r\nthe form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our\r\nnaval vessels. It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on\r\nthe Pacific Coast capable of docking our largest ships, and only one on\r\nthe Atlantic Coast, and that the latter has for the last six or seven\r\nmonths been under repair and therefore incapable of use. Immediate steps\r\nshould be taken to provide three or four docks of this capacity on the\r\nAtlantic Coast, at least one on the Pacific Coast, and a floating dock\r\nin the Gulf. This is the recommendation of a very competent Board,\r\nappointed to investigate the subject. There should also be ample\r\nprovision made for powder and projectiles, and other munitions of war,\r\nand for an increased number of officers and enlisted men. Some additions\r\nare also necessary to our navy-yards, for the repair and care of our\r\nlarge number of vessels. As there are now on the stocks five battle\r\nships of the largest class, which cannot be completed for a year or two,\r\nI concur with the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy for an\r\nappropriation authorizing the construction of one battle ship for the\r\nPacific Coast, where, at present, there is only one in commission and\r\none under construction, while on the Atlantic Coast there are three in\r\ncommission and four under construction; and also that several torpedo\r\nboats be authorized in connection with our general system of coast\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of\r\nCongress. The conditions now existing demand material changes in the\r\nlaws relating to the Territory. The great influx of population during\r\nthe past summer and fall and the prospect of a still larger immigration\r\nin the spring will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of\r\ncivil authority within the Territory or postpone the establishment of a\r\nmore thorough government.\r\n\r\nA general system of public surveys has not yet been extended to Alaska\r\nand all entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys.\r\nThe act of Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United\r\nStates contained the reservation that it should not be construed to put\r\nin force the general land laws of the country. By act approved March 3,\r\n1891, authority was given for entry of lands for town-site purposes and\r\nalso for the purchase of not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres then\r\nor thereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The\r\npurpose of Congress as thus far expressed has been that only such rights\r\nshould apply to that Territory as should be specifically named.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote\r\nand yet promising portion of our country. Special authority was given to\r\nthe President by the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1897, to divide\r\nthat Territory into two land districts and to designate the boundaries\r\nthereof and to appoint registers and receivers of said land offices, and\r\nthe President was also authorized to appoint a surveyor-general for the\r\nentire district. Pursuant to this authority, a surveyor-general and\r\nreceiver have been appointed, with offices at Sitka. If in the ensuing\r\nyear the conditions justify it, the additional land district authorized\r\nby law will be established, with an office at some point in the Yukon\r\nValley. No appropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that\r\nis now necessary to be done for the two land districts into which the\r\nTerritory is to be divided.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of War in his suggestions as to the\r\nnecessity for a military force in the Territory of Alaska for the\r\nprotection of persons and property. Already a small force, consisting of\r\ntwenty-five men, with two officers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nRandall, of the Eighth Infantry, has been sent to St. Michael to\r\nestablish a military post.\r\n\r\nAs it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development\r\nand settlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizens\r\nthere with the benefits of legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon\r\nCongress the establishment of a system of government with such\r\nflexibility as will enable it to adjust itself to the future areas of\r\ngreatest population.\r\n\r\nThe startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon River\r\ncountry, of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people\r\nwho are wintering there without the means of leaving the country are\r\nconfirmed in such measure as to justify bringing the matter to the\r\nattention of Congress. Access to that country in winter can be had only\r\nby the passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and\r\nperhaps an impossible task. However, should these reports of the\r\nsuffering of our fellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at\r\nany cost should be made to carry them relief.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions\r\nunder which the Five Civilized Tribes were established in the Indian\r\nTerritory under treaty provisions with the United States, with the right\r\nof self-government and the exclusion of all white persons from within\r\ntheir borders, have undergone so complete a change as to render the\r\ncontinuance of the system thus inaugurated practically impossible. The\r\ntotal number of the Five Civilized Tribes, as shown by the last census,\r\nis 45,494, and this number has not materially increased; while the white\r\npopulation is estimated at from 200,000 to 250,000 which, by permission\r\nof the Indian Government has settled in the Territory. The present area\r\nof the Indian Territory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very\r\nfertile land. The United States citizens residing in the Territory, most\r\nof whom have gone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal\r\nauthorities, have made permanent homes for themselves. Numerous towns\r\nhave been built in which from 500 to 5,000 white people now reside.\r\nValuable residences and business houses have been erected in many of\r\nthem. Large business enterprises are carried on in which vast sums\r\nof money are employed, and yet these people, who have invested their\r\ncapital in the development of the productive resources of the country,\r\nare without title to the land they occupy, and have no voice whatever\r\nin the government either of the Nations or Tribes. Thousands of their\r\nchildren who were born in the Territory are of school age, but the doors\r\nof the schools of the Nations are shut against them, and what education\r\nthey get is by private contribution. No provision for the protection of\r\nthe life or property of these white citizens is made by the Tribal\r\nGovernments and Courts.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have\r\nabsorbed great tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and\r\ngovernment by an Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to\r\nthe detriment of the people. It has been found impossible for the United\r\nStates to keep its citizens out of the Territory, and the executory\r\nconditions contained in the treaties with these Nations have for the\r\nmost part become impossible of execution. Nor has it been possible for\r\nthe Tribal Governments to secure to each individual Indian his full\r\nenjoyment in common with other Indians of the common property of the\r\nNations. Friends of the Indians have long believed that the best\r\ninterests of the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes would be found in\r\nAmerican citizenship, with all the rights and privileges which belong to\r\nthat condition.\r\n\r\nBy section 16, of the act of March 3, 1893, the President was authorized\r\nto appoint three commissioners to enter into negotiations with the\r\nCherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (or Creek), and Seminole Nations,\r\ncommonly known as the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory.\r\nBriefly, the purposes of the negotiations were to be: The extinguishment\r\nof Tribal titles to any lands within that Territory now held by any and\r\nall such Nations or Tribes, either by cession of the same or some part\r\nthereof to the United States, or by allotment and division of the same\r\nin severalty among the Indians of such Nations or Tribes respectively as\r\nmay be entitled to the same, or by such other method as may be agreed\r\nupon between the several Nations and Tribes aforesaid, or each of them,\r\nwith the United States, with a view to such an adjustment upon the basis\r\nof justice and equity as may, with the consent of the said Nations of\r\nIndians so far as may be necessary, be requisite and suitable to enable\r\nthe ultimate creation of a State or States of the Union which shall\r\nembrace the lands within said Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians\r\nwere very slow to act, and those in control manifested a decided\r\ndisinclination to meet with favor the propositions submitted to them.\r\nA little more than three years after this organization the Commission\r\neffected an agreement with the Choctaw Nation alone. The Chickasaws,\r\nhowever, refused to agree to its terms, and as they have a common\r\ninterest with the Choctaws in the lands of said Nations, the agreement\r\nwith the latter Nation could have no effect without the consent of the\r\nformer. On April 23, 1897, the Commission effected an agreement with\r\nboth tribes--the Choctaws and Chickasaws. This agreement, it is\r\nunderstood, has been ratified by the constituted authorities of the\r\nrespective Tribes or Nations parties thereto, and only requires\r\nratification by Congress to make it binding.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of September, 1897, an agreement was effected with the Creek\r\nNation, but it is understood that the National Council of said Nation\r\nhas refused to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with the\r\nCherokees, the most populous of the Five Civilized Tribes, and with the\r\nSeminoles, the smallest in point of numbers and territory.\r\n\r\nThe provision in the Indian Appropriation Act, approved June 10, 1896,\r\nmakes it the duty of the Commission to investigate and determine the\r\nrights of applicants for citizenship in the Five Civilized Tribes,\r\nand to make complete census rolls of the citizens of said Tribes. The\r\nCommission is at present engaged in this work among the Creeks, and has\r\nmade appointments for taking the census of these people up to and\r\nincluding the 30th of the present month.\r\n\r\nShould the agreement between the Choctaws and Chickasaws be ratified by\r\nCongress and should the other Tribes fail to make an agreement with the\r\nCommission, then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be had\r\nby Congress, which, while just and honorable to the Indians, shall be\r\nequitable to the white people who have settled upon these lands by\r\ninvitation of the Tribal Nations.\r\n\r\nHon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says:\r\n\"Individual ownership is, in their (the Commission's) opinion,\r\nabsolutely essential to any permanent improvement in present conditions,\r\nand the lack of it is the root of nearly all the evils which so\r\ngrievously afflict these people. Allotment by agreement is the only\r\npossible method, unless the United States Courts are clothed with the\r\nauthority to apportion the lands among the citizen Indians for whose use\r\nit was originally granted.\"\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure\r\nfor the evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts,\r\nexcepting by their resumption by the Government which created them.\r\n\r\nThe recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and towns\r\nthroughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce, and\r\ndemonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws\r\nas will make the regulations of the national quarantine authorities\r\nparamount. The Secretary of the Treasury, in the portion of his report\r\nrelating to the operation of the Marine Hospital Service, calls\r\nattention to the defects in the present quarantine laws, and recommends\r\namendments thereto which will give the Treasury Department the requisite\r\nauthority to prevent the invasion of epidemic diseases from foreign\r\ncountries, and in times of emergency, like that of the past summer, will\r\nadd to the efficiency of the sanitary measures for the protection of the\r\npeople, and at the same time prevent unnecessary restriction of\r\ncommerce. I concur in his recommendation.\r\n\r\nIn further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow\r\nfever, the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the\r\ndisease, which up to the present time has been undetermined, is obvious,\r\nand to this end a systematic bacteriological investigation should be\r\nmade. I therefore recommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a\r\ncommission by the President, to consist of four expert bacteriologists,\r\none to be selected from the medical officers of the Marine Hospital\r\nService, one to be appointed from civil life, one to be detailed from\r\nthe medical officers of the Army, and one from the medical officers of\r\nthe Navy.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railway, Main Line, was sold under the decree of the\r\nUnited States Court for the District of Nebraska, on the 1st and 2d of\r\nNovember of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the\r\nprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest\r\nthereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness, $58,448,223.75.\r\nThe bid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire\r\nmortgage claim of the Government, principal and interest.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific Line, upon\r\nwhich the Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at\r\nthe instance of the Government to December 16, 1897. The debt of this\r\ndivision of the Union Pacific Railway to the Government on November 1,\r\n1897, was the principal of the subsidy bonds, $6,303,000, and the unpaid\r\nand accrued interest thereon, $6,626,690.33, making a total of\r\n$12,929,690.33.\r\n\r\nThe sale of this road was originally advertised for November 4, but for\r\nthe purpose of securing the utmost public notice of the event it was\r\npostponed until December 16, and a second advertisement of the sale was\r\nmade. By the decree of the Court, the upset price on the sale of the\r\nKansas Pacific will yield to the Government the sum of $2,500,000 over\r\nall prior liens, costs, and charges. If no other or better bid is made,\r\nthis sum is all that the Government will receive on its claim of nearly\r\n$13,000,000. The Government has no information as to whether there will\r\nbe other bidders or a better bid than the minimum amount herein stated.\r\nThe question presented therefore is: Whether the Government shall, under\r\nthe authority given it by the act of March 3, 1887, purchase or redeem\r\nthe road in the event that a bid is not made by private parties covering\r\nthe entire Government claim. To qualify the Government to bid at the\r\nsales will require a deposit of $900,000, as follows: In the Government\r\ncause $500,000 and in each of the first mortgage causes $200,000, and\r\nin the latter the deposit must be in cash. Payments at the sale are as\r\nfollows: Upon the acceptance of the bid a sum which with the amount\r\nalready deposited shall equal fifteen per cent of the bid; the balance\r\nin installments of twenty-five per cent thirty, forty, and fifty days\r\nafter the confirmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas Pacific\r\nprior to that of the Government on the 30th July, 1897, principal and\r\ninterest, amounted to $7,281,048.11. The Government, therefore, should\r\nit become the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first\r\nmortgage lien.\r\n\r\nI believe that under the act of 1887 it has the authority to do this and\r\nin absence of any action by Congress I shall direct the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the Court's decree\r\nto qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least\r\nequal the principal of the debt due to the Government; but suggest in\r\norder to remove all controversy that an amendment of the law be\r\nimmediately passed explicitly giving such powers and appropriating in\r\ngeneral terms whatever sum is sufficient therefor.\r\n\r\nIn so important a matter as the Government becoming the possible owner\r\nof railroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel\r\nconstrained to lay before Congress these facts for its consideration and\r\naction before the consummation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that\r\nthe Government should not permit the property to be sold at a price\r\nwhich will yield less than one-half of the principal of its debt and\r\nless than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. But\r\nwhether the Government, rather than accept less than its claim, should\r\nbecome a bidder and thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the\r\nCongress for action.\r\n\r\nThe Library building provided for by the act of Congress approved April\r\n15, 1886, has been completed and opened to the public. It should be a\r\nmatter of congratulation that through the foresight and munificence of\r\nCongress the nation possesses this noble treasure-house of knowledge. It\r\nis earnestly to be hoped that having done so much toward the cause of\r\neducation, Congress will continue to develop the Library in every phase\r\nof research to the end that it may be not only one of the most\r\nmagnificent but among the richest and most useful libraries in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe important branch of our Government known as the Civil Service,\r\nthe practical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest\r\ndiscussion, has of late years received increased legislative and\r\nExecutive approval. During the past few months the service has been\r\nplaced upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit.\r\nWhile the right of our veteran soldiers to reinstatement in deserving\r\ncases has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have\r\nbeen carefully guarded against, the examinations for admittance to the\r\nservice enlarged and at the same time rendered less technical and more\r\npractical; and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing\r\nbefore dismissal upon all cases where incompetency is charged or demand\r\nmade for the removal of officials in any of the Departments. This order\r\nhas been made to give to the accused his right to be heard but without\r\nin any way impairing the power of removal, which should always be\r\nexercised in cases of inefficiency and incompetency, and which is one\r\nof the vital safeguards of the civil service reform system, preventing\r\nstagnation and deadwood and keeping every employee keenly alive to the\r\nfact that the security of his tenure depends not on favor but on his\r\nown tested and carefully watched record of service.\r\n\r\nMuch of course still remains to be accomplished before the system can\r\nbe made reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in the\r\nclassified service which ought to be exempted and others not classified\r\nmay properly be included. I shall not hesitate to exempt cases which I\r\nthink have been improperly included in the classified service or include\r\nthose which in my judgment will best promote the public service. The\r\nsystem has the approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to\r\nuphold and extend it.\r\n\r\nI am forced by the length of this Message to omit many important\r\nreferences to affairs of the Government with which Congress will\r\nhave to deal at the present session. They are fully discussed in the\r\ndepartmental reports, to all of which I invite your earnest attention.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several\r\nDepartments will, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the\r\nCongress may not find it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the\r\nGovernment, it should not encourage their increase. These expenses will\r\nin my judgment admit of a decrease in many branches of the Government\r\nwithout injury to the public service. It is a commanding duty to keep\r\nthe appropriations within the receipts of the Government, and thus avoid\r\na deficit.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 6, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress, approved July 19, 1897, entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriations to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1897, and for prior years, for other\r\npurposes,\" provided for the acceptance by the Government of the United\r\nStates of the invitation extended by the Republic of France to\r\nparticipate in an international exposition to be held at Paris, from\r\nApril 15 to November 15, 1900, and authorized the President to appoint a\r\nspecial commissioner with a view to securing all attainable information\r\nnecessary to a full and complete understanding by Congress in regard to\r\nthe participation of this Government in that exposition.\r\n\r\nMaj. Moses P. Handy of Chicago, was appointed such special commissioner,\r\nand I now enclose his report, giving the details of his mission. It is\r\na comprehensive and clear presentation of the situation. He recommends\r\nthat an appropriation of $919,600 be granted, so that a creditable\r\nexhibit on behalf of the United States may be made. The details of this\r\nreport will show how this appropriation may be profitably expended.\r\n\r\nBesides securing a much larger amount of space than had been reserved,\r\nMajor Handy obtained the gratifying assurance that the United States\r\nwill be placed on a footing with the most favored nations, and \"that in\r\nthe installation of every important department the United States will\r\nhave a location commensurate with the dignity and importance of the\r\ncountry and adjoining in every case countries of the first rank.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the magnitude and importance of the approaching exposition,\r\nand of our standing among the nations which will be there represented,\r\nand in view also of our increased population and acknowledged progress\r\nin arts, science, and manufactures, I earnestly commend the report of\r\nMajor Handy to your consideration, and trust that a liberal\r\nappropriation may be made.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the magnificent exhibit of the French Republic at Chicago\r\nin 1893, on which a million dollars were expended, should be a strong\r\nincentive to reciprocal liberality on the part of the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and suggests to our citizens the necessity as well as the\r\npropriety of installing at the Paris Exposition an exhibit on a par with\r\nthat of the Government and people of France at Chicago, and in keeping\r\nwith the scope and extent of the preparations which are being made by\r\nnearly all the important nations of the earth for their proposed\r\nexhibits in that exposition.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the subject be given timely and favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 14, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in regard to\r\nthe award of the commissioners appointed pursuant to the stipulations of\r\nthe convention of February 8, 1896, between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, providing for the settlement of the claims presented by the\r\nlatter against the former in virtue of the convention of February 29,\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of State presents a clear epitome of the\r\naward and renders unnecessary any extended observations on my part\r\nfurther than to say that I cordially coincide with his recommendation\r\nand that our treaty obligations demand prompt and favorable action by\r\nCongress, which I urgently hope may be taken, to the end that these\r\nlong-pending questions may be finally and satisfactorily terminated.\r\n\r\nThe total amount necessary to satisfy the award of the commissioners is\r\n$473,151.26, which I recommend be appropriated.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 18, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, touching the lynching in 1895 at Yreka, Cal., of\r\nLuis Moreno, a Mexican citizen, and the demand of the Mexican Government\r\nfor an indemnity for his relatives on account thereof.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course adopted in the case of the lynching of three\r\nItalian subjects at Hahnville, La., on August 8, 1896, I recommend the\r\nappropriation by Congress, out of humane consideration and without\r\nreference to the question of liability of the Government of the United\r\nStates in the premises, of the sum of $2,000 to be paid by the Secretary\r\nof State to the Government of Mexico, to be by that Government\r\ndistributed among the heirs of the above-named Luis Moreno.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 26, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State and\r\naccompanying papers presenting the claim of Capt.

In view of the value of these reports\r\nto the business interests of the country, I indorse the recommendation\r\nof the Secretary of State that Congress authorize the printing of a\r\nspecial edition of 10,000 copies of the general summary entitled \"Review\r\nof the World's Commerce,\" and 5,000 copies of Commercial Relations\r\n(including this summary), to enable the Department of State to meet the\r\ndemands for such information.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 16, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, House bill No. 2219, entitled \"An act for the relief of the\r\nadministrators of Isaac P. Tice, deceased, and others,\" without my\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is to confer upon the Court of Claims\r\njurisdiction to retry and determine a case brought by the\r\nrepresentatives of Isaac P. Tice against the United States in the Court\r\nof Claims in the year 1873 to recover from the Government the sum of\r\n$25,000, the alleged value of certain meters invented by Isaac P. Tice\r\nfor the purpose of measuring the quality and strength of distilled\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that this amount, together with the sum of $733.33 for\r\nstorage of said meters, was due to the claimant under a contract made\r\nbetween Tice and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in pursuance of\r\nsection 15 of the act of March 2, 1867 (14 Stats., 481). From the report\r\nof the case in 13 Court of Claims Reports, 112, it appears that the\r\nmatter was fully and deliberately tried and argued both on behalf of the\r\nclaimant and of the United States, and that at December term, 1877, the\r\nCourt of Claims rendered a decision adverse to the claimant, expressly\r\nstating that the claimants had failed to establish their claim both in\r\nlaw and on the facts. Not satisfied with this conclusion of the Court of\r\nClaims, the claimants took an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, where the case was again argued and was decided, October term,\r\n1878, the judgment of the Court of Claims being declared to be in\r\naccordance with the law and therefore affirmed. In these two decisions\r\nthe law and the facts pertaining to the claim were fully set forth and\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe bill further confers upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction to try\r\nand determine certain alleged claims of said Tice and others for money\r\ncollected on account of the Tice meters, but not paid over to him or\r\nthem under the regulations of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the latter claim, according to the report of the committee\r\nof the House of Representatives to which this bill was referred, is\r\n$140,000. It does not appear from the report of the committee, nor from\r\nany documents to which I have access, who are the other persons by whom\r\nthis latter sum is claimed. The claim for $140,000 must have accrued\r\nprior to July, 1871, and therefore at this time is of at least\r\ntwenty-seven years' standing.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be perceived that the object of the bill is to remove from\r\nthe pathway of the claimants two legal bars to the prosecution of their\r\nclaim in the courts--one, the bar of the statute of limitations, which\r\nrequires all claimants against the Government to present their claims\r\nand bring actions thereon within six years from the time the cause of\r\naction accrues; and the other, that bar of estoppel which arises by\r\nreason of a former adverse judgment, rendered in a court of competent\r\njurisdiction. This is not a general modification of the law in these\r\nrespects, but a special application of it to these particular claimants.\r\n\r\nIf the principle on which the statute of limitations is founded is\r\nwise and beneficent, then the effect of it ought not to be impaired by\r\nspecial legislative exemptions in favor of particular persons or cases\r\nexcept upon very clear and just grounds, where no lack of diligence in\r\nthe prosecution of the claim is apparent. I cannot find in the papers\r\nsubmitted to me any sufficient grounds to justify a special exception\r\nfrom the ordinary rule in favor of these claimants. As to the claim for\r\n$140,000, no reason is stated why it was not included in the original\r\nsuit nor why action upon it was not brought against the Government\r\nwithin the six years allowed by the statute for that purpose. To permit\r\nsuch an action to be brought now is simply, without any reason of a\r\nspecial nature, to grant a privilege to these claimants which is denied\r\nto all other citizens of the United States, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the general statute of limitations. The principle\r\nunderlying statutes of limitations and the reasons for the maintenance\r\nof such a rule of litigation are much more cogent when applied to claims\r\nagainst the Government than when applied to claims against individuals.\r\n\r\nThese claims do not differ in their character from ordinary business\r\ntransactions such as transpire every day between private persons or\r\nbusiness corporations. The Government can only defend itself against\r\nclaims of this nature through its public officers and with the use of\r\nsuch public records as the Departments may furnish. Great difficulties\r\nare experienced by it in contesting fraudulent and unjust claims, and it\r\nis only fair in the interest of the public that a rigorous adherence to\r\nsome rule of limitation should be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe provision of the bill which practically directs a new trial of the\r\nclaim for $25,000, decided adversely to the claimants more than twenty\r\nyears ago, is still more objectionable. These parties had their day in\r\ncourt. They produced their witnesses and were heard both originally and\r\nupon appeal, and upon the case they were then able to make the court\r\ndecided they had no claim against the Government. It is now suggested\r\nthat other witnesses have been discovered who can supply the lack of\r\nproof which was produced on the former trial. Such a ground for a new\r\ntrial would never be considered in any court of law in the land in a\r\ncase between private parties where such a length of time had intervened\r\nsince the former trial. No explanation of a satisfactory nature is\r\nfurnished for the failure of the claimants to produce these witnesses\r\nupon the original trial.\r\n\r\nThe bill further provides that upon a retrial of the original claim, or\r\nupon the trial of the new claim, the claimants shall be at liberty to\r\noffer in evidence the depositions of witnesses now on the files of any\r\nof the committees of Congress in relation to the aforesaid matters,\r\nwhich may be introduced as evidence in case of the death or disability\r\nof the deponents.\r\n\r\nThis provision will enable the claimants to present _ex-parte_\r\naffidavits, prepared by the claimants or their attorneys, without\r\nopportunity being afforded to the Government to cross-examine, provided\r\nthe claimants can show that the deposing witnesses are either dead or\r\nunder disability, by which, no doubt, is intended any such disability by\r\nreason of absence, illness, and the like, as may render them legally\r\nincapable of being produced in person to testify upon the retrial. Such\r\na provision as this is most dangerous to the interests of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI fail to see any reason in the facts connected with these claims for\r\ngranting to these parties relief of this extraordinary nature.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury of the United States ought to be very carefully guarded\r\nagainst attacks of those who come forward with stale claims, and\r\nespecially from the attacks of those who have already been fully heard\r\naccording to the methods prescribed by the statutes.\r\n\r\nTo approve this bill would be to furnish a very dangerous precedent\r\nwhich would open the door to demands upon Congress in other cases which\r\nhave been fully heard and determined.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I am constrained to withhold my approval from this\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, June 14, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith (having reference to Senate Document No. 4,\r\nFifty-fifth Congress, second session) a report made by Thomas W.\r\nCridler, Third Assistant Secretary of State, who, upon the death of\r\nMaj. Moses P. Handy, I designated to continue the work as special\r\ncommissioner, under the act of Congress approved July 19, 1897, in\r\nrelation to the acceptance by the Government of the United States of the\r\ninvitation of France to participate in the International Exposition to\r\nbe held at Paris from April 15 to November 5, 1900.\r\n\r\nI cordially renew my recommendation that a liberal appropriation be\r\nimmediately granted.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Interior relative\r\nto Senate resolution of June 10, 1898, requesting the President \"to make\r\nsuch arrangements as may be necessary to secure at the Trans-Mississippi\r\nand International Exposition to be held in the city of Omaha, Neb., the\r\nattendance of representatives of the Iroquois tribes and Delawares of\r\nCanada and of the Abenakis of St. Francis and Becaucourt, and such other\r\nIndian nations as have emigrated from the territory now of the United\r\nStates to Canada.\"\r\n\r\nTo carry out this resolution, if it shall be found agreeable to the\r\nGovernment of Canada, it will be necessary for this Government to send\r\nan agent to visit the tribes and secure their assent, organize the\r\nrepresentative delegations, escort them to the exposition, take charge\r\nof and care for them while there and until they are returned to their\r\nrespective tribes.\r\n\r\nThe resolution seems to presuppose that there are funds which may be\r\nlawfully used to defray the expenses which must necessarily be incurred\r\nin the premises. By reference to the Secretary's report, it will be seen\r\nthat there are no moneys lawfully available for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be presumed that the Senate, under such circumstances,\r\nwould desire the Executive to take the action indicated in the\r\nresolution, and I am therefore constrained to await the requisite\r\nappropriation by Congress for the payment of the expenses that must be\r\nnecessarily incurred in the accomplishment of the proposed objects.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 6, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the Congress, the report of\r\nthe Hawaiian Commission appointed in pursuance of the \"Joint resolution\r\nto provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States,\"\r\napproved July 7, 1898, together with a copy of the civil and penal laws\r\nof Hawaii.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 5, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of Agriculture on the work\r\nand expenditures of the agricultural experiment stations established\r\nunder the act of Congress of March 2, 1887, for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1898, in accordance with the act making appropriations for the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture for the said fiscal year.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 5, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of December 21, 1898,\r\nrequesting the President, \"If it be not inconsistent with the public\r\nservice, to inform the Senate whether authentic information is in\r\npossession of the Government as to the alleged dissolution of the\r\nGovernment of the United States of Central America.\" I transmit herewith\r\na report from the Secretary of State with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 6, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith in answer to the resolution of the Senate of\r\nDecember 15, 1898, a communication from the Secretary of State covering\r\na preliminary report from the Nicaraguan Canal Commission, dated\r\nDecember 26, 1898, relative to its progress in investigating the\r\nquestion of the proper route, the feasibility, and cost of construction\r\nof the Nicaragua Canal.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 6, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\ninclosing the annual report of the Director of the Bureau of the\r\nAmerican Republics, with accompanying documents. In view of the improved\r\ncondition and increasing usefulness of the Bureau, to which I have\r\nalready called attention in my annual message, and the welcome\r\nassurances of greater activity on the part of the other American\r\nrepublics in support of its purposes, I cordially indorse the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary of State. It will doubtless be as\r\ngratifying to Congress as it is to me to be informed that the Argentine\r\nRepublic has decided to renew its relations with the Bureau, and that\r\nthere are grounds for hoping that the International American Union,\r\ncreated by the impressive conference of the representatives of our\r\nsister republics and those of the United States in Washington in\r\n1889-90, will soon be perfected by the adhesion of the Republic of Chile\r\nto the compact for the support of the Bureau as the organ of the union.\r\nThe interest of the United States in giving the fullest possible effect\r\nto the laudable desire of the international conference to promote not\r\nonly trade intercourse but a closer fellowship among the various\r\nrepublics of this hemisphere is so evident that I am satisfied the\r\nprogress made by the bureau, as a practical agency for attaining these\r\nobjects, will receive the commendation and support of Congress.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 11, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of June 6, 1898, I transmit\r\na report from the Secretary of State, inclosing copies of all papers on\r\nfile in the Department of State relating to the case of Hugo O. Loewi,\r\nincluding those printed in Document No. 186, Senate, Fifty-fifth\r\nCongress, second session.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 17, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the month of October, 1897, reports were\r\nreceived here of the probable loss of the whaling fleet in the Arctic\r\nregions, and of the likelihood that nearly 300 men, composing the\r\nofficers and crews of the fleet, would perish from hunger unless succor\r\ncould reach them early in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe revenue cutter _Bear_ was known to be _en route_ from the\r\nArctic Ocean to Puget Sound, Washington. Her arrival was anxiously\r\nawaited, as no other suitable Government vessel could be made available\r\nfor Arctic work. That ship arrived at Seattle, Wash., on the 6th of\r\nNovember, after a six-months' cruise in the Arctic, and I at once\r\nordered an expedition prepared for the relief of the imperiled whalemen.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the _Bear_ was commenced on the 11th of\r\nNovember, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury. Her\r\nofficers and men of the Revenue-Cutter Service all volunteered for the\r\nperilous work, and the ship was completely fitted out, and, under the\r\ncommand of Capt. Francis Tuttle, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, sailed\r\non her errand of mercy November 29, 1897, within nineteen days from the\r\ninception of the movement.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the expedition was briefly as follows:\r\n\r\nThe ship was to be fully provided with rations for the ice-imperiled\r\nwhalemen, which were to be conveyed to them as soon as the ice\r\nconditions in Bering Strait would permit the passage through. An\r\noverland expedition was to be landed from the _Bear_ as soon as\r\npracticable, at some point on the coast of Alaska, in Bering Sea, to be\r\ndetermined upon by Captain Tuttle. The problem of getting food to the\r\nimperiled people at the earliest time possible was the all-important\r\nconsideration, for it was fully understood that the _Bear_ could\r\nnot, under the most favorable conditions of ice navigation in that\r\nregion, reach their neighborhood before the following July or August.\r\nThe utter lack of transportation of any kind in this far-off land\r\nsuggested the idea, which was adopted as the only possible plan, of\r\ndriving reindeer overland, to be slaughtered on arrival, for food to\r\nlast until the arrival of the _Bear_ with supplies the following\r\nsummer. The reindeer were to be collected by the overland expedition\r\nfrom several points in Alaska, notably Cape Prince of Wales and Point\r\nRodney, and, with such aid as could be procured from natives and others,\r\ndriven to Point Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe overland expedition was formed, and consisted of First Lieut. David\r\nH. Jarvis, Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding; Second Lieut. Ellsworth\r\nP. Bertholf, Revenue-Cutter Service, and Dr. Samuel J. Call, surgeon of\r\nthe _Bear_, all volunteers. This overland expedition was landed\r\nfrom the _Bear_ at Cape Vancouver, in Bering Sea, Alaska, on the\r\n16th of December, 1897, and commenced its toilsome and dreary journey\r\nthrough an arctic night to Point Barrow, Captain Tuttle returning with\r\nhis command to winter at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and from there to take\r\nadvantage of the first opportunity in the early summer of 1898 to get\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe overland expedition worked its way to the reindeer stations named,\r\nand succeeded in getting together about 450 deer. They were materially\r\naided by Mr. W.T. Lopp, agent of the American Missionary Society at Cape\r\nPrince of Wales, and Artisarlook, a native of that region, both of whom,\r\nat great personal sacrifice, left their families and accompanied the\r\nreindeer herd to Point Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe overland expedition, after a difficult and hazardous journey of\r\nnearly 2,000 miles through the storms and bitter cold of an arctic\r\nwinter, reached Point Barrow with the herd on the 29th of March, 1898,\r\nthree months and twelve days from their landing from the _Bear_ at\r\nCape Vancouver, Alaskan coast of Bering Sea. They arrived none too soon.\r\nFrom the lack of an authoritative head, supplemented by bad sanitary\r\nconditions and want of proper food, the men from the whale ships\r\nquartered there were found upon the verge of great suffering, while\r\nsickness had broken out among them. Lieutenant Jarvis, under the\r\ninstructions given him by the Secretary of the Treasury, at once assumed\r\ncharge, in the name of the Government, of the camp and locality of Point\r\nBarrow, and he and Dr. Call devoted themselves with intelligent energy\r\nto correcting the wretched conditions found to exist. Order was at once\r\ninaugurated. Fresh meat from the reindeer herd was supplied, the\r\nsanitary conditions were improved, and the general health and comfort\r\nof the whalemen received immediate attention. Lieutenant Jarvis and\r\nDr. Call remained at Point Barrow in charge until the arrival of the\r\n_Bear_, July 28, 1898, a period of four months. As soon as the\r\n_Bear_ arrived Captain Tuttle began the distribution of ample\r\nsupplies to the whalemen on shipboard and on shore. Having supplied all\r\ndemands generously, succored the needy to the number of 275 between\r\nPoint Barrow and Kotzebue Sound, taking on board the _Bear_ 146\r\nwhalemen, 91 of whom were brought to the Pacific coast (the remainder\r\nhaving of their own volition left the ship _en route_), the vessel\r\narrived back at Seattle on the 13th of September, after an absence in\r\nthe bleak and dreary regions of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean of about\r\nseventeen months.\r\n\r\nThe hardships and perils encountered by the members of the overland\r\nexpedition in their great journey through an almost uninhabited region,\r\na barren waste of ice and snow, facing death itself every day for nearly\r\nfour months, over a route never before traveled by white men, with no\r\nrefuge but at the end of the journey, carrying relief and cheer to 275\r\ndistressed citizens of our country, all make another glorious page in\r\nthe history of American seamen. They reflect by their heroic and gallant\r\nstruggles the highest credit upon themselves and the Government which\r\nthey faithfully served. I commend this heroic crew to the grateful\r\nconsideration of Congress and the American people.\r\n\r\nThe year just closed has been fruitful of noble achievements in the\r\nfield of war; and while I have commended to your consideration the\r\nnames of heroes who have shed luster upon the American name in valorous\r\ncontests and battles by land and sea, it is no less my pleasure to\r\ninvite your attention to a victory of peace the results of which cannot\r\nwell be magnified, and the dauntless courage of the men engaged stamps\r\nthem as true heroes, whose services cannot pass unrecognized.\r\n\r\nI have therefore the honor to submit the following recommendations and\r\nto ask your favorable action thereon:\r\n\r\n1. That the thanks of Congress be voted to Capt. Francis Tuttle,\r\nRevenue-Cutter Service, and the officers and enlisted men composing his\r\ncommand for their able and gallant services.\r\n\r\n2. That the thanks of Congress be extended to the members of the\r\noverland expedition; First Lieut. David H. Jarvis, Revenue-Cutter\r\nService, commanding the overland expedition; to Second Lieut. Ellsworth\r\nP. Bertholf, Revenue-Cutter Service, and to Dr. Samuel J. Call, Surgeon.\r\n\r\n3. That gold medals of honor of appropriate design, to be approved by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, be awarded to Lieutenants Jarvis and\r\nBertholf and Dr. Call, commemorative of their heroic struggles in aid of\r\nsuffering fellow-men.\r\n\r\n4. That the sum of $2,500 be appropriated to be disbursed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in bestowing rewards upon W.T. Lopp,\r\nArtisarlook, and native herders, who rendered material aid to the relief\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 19, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a second report on the investigations of the\r\nagricultural capabilities of Alaska for the year 1898, in accordance\r\nwith the acts of Congress making appropriations for the Department of\r\nAgriculture for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1898, and June 30,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 19, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 708, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Albert E. Redstone.\"\r\n\r\nMy objections to the bill are:\r\n\r\nFirst. It assumes that the beneficiary, Albert E. Redstone, sustained a\r\nloss by the incorporation of his preemption claim within the limits of\r\nthe Sierra Forest Reserve. This reserve was established by executive\r\nproclamation of February 14, 1893 (27 Stats., 1059), issued under\r\nsection 24 of the act of March 8, 1891 (26 Stats., 1103), and contains\r\nthe following saving clause for the protection of existing claims under\r\nthe public land laws:\r\n\r\n  * * * Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands\r\n  which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal\r\n  entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper\r\n  United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been\r\n  made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make\r\n  entry or filing of record has not expired; * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Redstone did not sustain any loss by the creation of this reserve,\r\nbecause his rights, if he had any at that time, were fully recognized\r\nand protected by this provision in the proclamation.\r\n\r\nSecond. Mr. Redstone's preemption declaratory statement was filed April\r\n6, 1889, and alleged settlement upon the same day. The land covered\r\nthereby had not been proclaimed for sale, and under sections 2265 and\r\n2267 of the Revised Statutes, Mr. Redstone had thirty-three months from\r\nthe date of his settlement within which to make proof and payment for\r\nthe land, but in fact he never attempted to make such proof or payment.\r\nHis preemption claim had therefore expired by operation of law long\r\nbefore the creation of this reserve. After his filing had thus expired\r\nMr. Redstone was cited by the Land Department to show cause why his\r\nclaim should not be declared at an end, and his filing formally canceled\r\nupon the public records, but he made no response or defense, and the\r\nfiling was accordingly canceled.\r\n\r\nThird. The Commissioner of the General Land Office reports that an\r\ninvestigation, made under the supervision of his office, shows that Mr.\r\nRedstone had actually abandoned the land covered by his preemption claim\r\nbefore the reserve was established.\r\n\r\nFourth. The Commissioner of the General Land Office reports that an\r\nexamination, made under the supervision of his office, shows that the\r\nimprovements placed upon this land during the life of this preemption\r\nclaim and thereafter abandoned were less than $200 in value, while the\r\namount appropriated in this bill is $1,800.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 27, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a provision in the act making appropriations for\r\nthe Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899,\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of Agriculture \"upon the\r\nforestry investigations and work of the Department of Agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 9, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 2nd instant, requesting information \"whether any franchises or\r\nconcessions of any character are being or have been granted by any\r\nmunicipality in Cuba or Puerto Rico since the military occupation\r\nthereof by the United States,\" etc., a report from the Secretary of\r\nWar and accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 11, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the response of the Secretary of State to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of February 4, 1899, calling\r\nfor information in his possession concerning certain alleged outrages\r\ncommitted upon the person of Bishop Earl Cranston and other American\r\ncitizens in the city of Peking, China.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 18, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the response of the Secretary of Agriculture to the\r\nresolution of the Senate of February 8, 1899, calling for information\r\nin his possession regarding the practical usefulness of reservoirs to\r\nagriculture in the irrigated region of the United States, especially\r\nas affecting the distribution of water to crops, the area and value of\r\nreclaimed land, and the stability and unprofitableness of farming where\r\nirrigation is practised.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 21, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanying the commercial relations of the United States for the\r\nyear 1898, being the annual reports of the consular officers upon the\r\nindustries and commerce of foreign countries. In view of the value of\r\nthese reports to the manufacturing and exporting interests of the\r\ncountry, I indorse the recommendation of the Secretary of State that\r\nCongress authorize the printing of the usual editions of 10,000 copies\r\nof the general summary, entitled \"Review of the World's Commerce\" and\r\nof 5,000 copies of \"Commercial Relations\" (including this summary), to\r\nenable the Department of State to meet the demand for such information.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 1, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a communication\r\nfrom the Secretary of Agriculture, covering a report on the progress of\r\nthe beet-sugar industry in the United States during the year 1898. It\r\nembraces the results of numerous chemical analyses and the observations\r\nmade by a special agent in various parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 3, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of February 28 last\r\ndirected to the Secretary of State, I transmit a report from that\r\nofficer submitting a list of claims against Spain, growing out of the\r\ninsurrection in Cuba, filed in the Department of State, not embraced\r\nin Senate Document No. 79, Fifty-fourth Congress, second session.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 5, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of your deliberations you are called to mourn with your\r\ncountrymen the death of Vice-President Hobart, who passed from this life\r\non the morning of November 21 last. His great soul now rests in eternal\r\npeace. His private life was pure and elevated, while his public career\r\nwas ever distinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and\r\nexalted motives. He has been removed from the high office which he\r\nhonored and dignified, but his lofty character, his devotion to duty,\r\nhis honesty of purpose, and noble virtues remain with us as a priceless\r\nlegacy and example.\r\n\r\nThe Fifty-sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with the\r\ncountry in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will\r\namong the people at home, and in relations of peace and friendship with\r\nevery government of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great\r\nincrease in volume and value. The combined imports and exports for the\r\nyear are the largest ever shown by a single year in all our history.\r\nOur exports for 1899 alone exceeded by more than a billion dollars our\r\nimports and exports combined in 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per\r\ncent less than in 1870, while the exports per capita are 58 per cent\r\nmore than in 1870, showing the enlarged capacity of the United States\r\nto satisfy the wants of its own increasing population, as well as to\r\ncontribute to those of the peoples of other nations.\r\n\r\nExports of agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufactured\r\nproducts we exported in value $339,592,146, being larger than any\r\nprevious year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our\r\nhistory when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded\r\nthose bought abroad were 1898 and 1899.\r\n\r\nGovernment receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1899, including $11,798,314.14, part payment of the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.35. Customs receipts were\r\n$206,128,481.75, and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving a\r\ndeficit of $89,111,559.67.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year will aggregate $640,958,112, and upon the basis of\r\npresent appropriations the expenditures will aggregate $600,958,112,\r\nleaving a surplus of $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the internal-revenue receipts\r\nwere increased about $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe present gratifying strength of the Treasury is shown by the\r\nfact that on December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was\r\n$278,004,837.72, of which $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion.\r\nThe conditions of confidence which prevail throughout the country have\r\nbrought gold into more general use and customs receipts are now almost\r\nentirely paid in that coin.\r\n\r\nThe strong position of the Treasury with respect to cash on hand and the\r\nfavorable showing made by the revenues have made it possible for the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to take action under the provisions of section\r\n3694, Revised Statutes, relating to the sinking fund. Receipts exceeded\r\nexpenditures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by\r\n$13,413,389.91, and, as mentioned above, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nestimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at\r\nthe end of the year. Under such conditions it was deemed advisable and\r\nproper to resume compliance with the provisions of the sinking-fund law,\r\nwhich for eight years has not been done because of deficiencies in the\r\nrevenues. The Treasury Department therefore offered to purchase during\r\nNovember $25,000,000 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent\r\nfunded loan of 1907, at the current market price. The amount offered\r\nand purchased during November was $18,408,600. The premium paid by\r\nthe Government on such purchases was $2,263,521 and the net saving\r\nin interest was about $2,885,000. The success of this operation was\r\nsufficient to induce the Government to continue the offer to purchase\r\nbonds to and including the 23d day of December, instant, unless the\r\nremainder of the $25,000,000 called for should be presented in the\r\nmeantime for redemption.\r\n\r\nIncreased activity in industry, with its welcome attendant--a larger\r\nemployment for labor at higher wages--gives to the body of the people\r\na larger power to absorb the circulating medium. It is further true\r\nthat year by year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the\r\nincreasing volume of agricultural products, cotton, corn, and wheat,\r\ncalls for a larger volume of money supply. This is especially noticeable\r\nat the crop-harvesting and crop-moving period.\r\n\r\nIn its earlier history the National Banking Act seemed to prove a\r\nreasonable avenue through which needful additions to the circulation\r\ncould from time to time be made. Changing conditions have apparently\r\nrendered it now inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond\r\nsecurities required, resulting from large premiums which Government\r\nbonds command in the market, or the tax on note issues, or both\r\noperating together, appear to be the influences which impair its public\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is respectfully invited to this important\r\nmatter, with the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable\r\nmodifications can be made in the National Banking Act as will render\r\nits service in the particulars here referred to more responsive to\r\nthe people's needs. I again urge that national banks be authorized\r\nto organize with a capital of $25,000.\r\n\r\nI urgently recommend that to support the existing gold standard, and to\r\nmaintain \"the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and\r\nsilver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market\r\nand in the payment of debts,\" the Secretary of the Treasury be given\r\nadditional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds\r\nand to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to these\r\nends. The authority should include the power to sell bonds on long and\r\nshort time, as conditions may require, and should provide for a rate\r\nof interest lower than that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875.\r\nWhile there is now no commercial fright which withdraws gold from the\r\nGovernment, but, on the contrary, such widespread confidence that gold\r\nseeks the Treasury demanding paper money in exchange, yet the very\r\nsituation points to the present as the most fitting time to make\r\nadequate provision to insure the continuance of the gold standard and of\r\npublic confidence in the ability and purpose of the Government to meet\r\nall its obligations in the money which the civilized world recognizes\r\nas the best. The financial transactions of the Government are conducted\r\nupon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States bonds and\r\nuse gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of all the\r\nmoney issued or coined by authority of the Government. We are doing\r\nthese things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are\r\nnot compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the\r\npast, however, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us,\r\ntherefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when\r\nit arises, and the best means are those which are the most certain and\r\neconomical. Those now authorized have the virtue neither of directness\r\nnor economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our\r\nfinancial plight and embarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895,\r\nand 1896. Our receipts now equal our expenditures; deficient revenues\r\nno longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remaining cause by\r\nconferring the full and necessary power on the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand impose upon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and\r\npreserve the coins of the two metals on a parity with each other, which\r\nis the repeatedly declared policy of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I repeat my former recommendations that a portion of\r\nthe gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks\r\nshall be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not\r\nthereafter be paid out except for gold.\r\n\r\nThe value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our\r\ncommercial trade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea invites\r\nthe immediate action of the Congress. Our national development will be\r\none-sided and unsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our\r\ninland industries remains unaccompanied by progress on the seas. There\r\nis no lack of constitutional authority for legislation which shall give\r\nto the country maritime strength commensurate with its industrial\r\nachievements and with its rank among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe past year has recorded exceptional activity in our shipyards, and\r\nthe promises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abundant.\r\nAdvanced legislation for the protection of our seamen has been enacted.\r\nOur coast trade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the\r\nGovernment and since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequaled\r\nin our records or those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our\r\nopportunities, however, if we complacently regard only matters at home\r\nand blind ourselves to the necessity of securing our share in the\r\nvaluable carrying trade of the world.\r\n\r\nLast year American vessels transported a smaller share of our exports\r\nand imports than during any former year in all our history, and the\r\nmeasure of our dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested\r\nto our people. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the\r\nDepartments of the Government charged with military and naval operations\r\nin the East and West Indies had to obtain from foreign flags merchant\r\nvessels essential for those operations.\r\n\r\nThe other great nations have not hesitated to adopt the required means\r\nto develop their shipping as a factor in national defense and as one of\r\nthe surest and speediest means of obtaining for their producers a share\r\nin foreign markets. Like vigilance and effort on our part cannot fail\r\nto improve our situation, which is regarded with humiliation at home\r\nand with surprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the\r\nbeginning may be involved, will be offset later by more than equivalent\r\ngains.\r\n\r\nThe expense is as nothing compared to the advantage to be achieved.\r\nThe reestablishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure\r\nour continued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial\r\ntriumphs. I am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy\r\nof aid to our merchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and\r\nmarkets and upbuild our sea-carrying capacity for the products of\r\nagriculture and manufacture; which, with the increase of our Navy, mean\r\nmore work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to\r\nAmerican interests in every part of the world.\r\n\r\nCombinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions\r\nof trade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production,\r\nand determine the prices of products used and consumed by the people,\r\nare justly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the\r\nattention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Commission, created by the act of the Congress of June\r\n18, 1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed\r\nquestions involved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade\r\nand competition. They have not yet completed their investigation of this\r\nsubject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may\r\narrive are undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature\r\nand variety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may\r\nresult from large combinations concentrating more or less numerous\r\nenterprises and establishments, which previously to the formation of the\r\ncombination were carried on separately.\r\n\r\nIt is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control\r\nthe market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary\r\nto the general community, by suppressing natural and ordinary\r\ncompetition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer,\r\nare obnoxious not only to the common law but also to the public welfare.\r\nThere must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If\r\nthe present law can be extended more certainly to control or check these\r\nmonopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. Whatever power\r\nthe Congress possesses over this most important subject should be\r\npromptly ascertained and asserted.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison in his annual message of December 3, 1889, says:\r\n\r\n  Earnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the\r\n  question how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly\r\n  called \"trusts\" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as\r\n  they often are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize\r\n  the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity\r\n  they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be\r\n  made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints\r\nand monopolies was passed by Congress on the 2d of July, 1890. The\r\nprovisions of this statute are comprehensive and stringent. It declares\r\nevery contract or combination, in the form of a trust or otherwise,\r\nor conspiracy in the restraint of trade or commerce among the several\r\nStates or with foreign nations, to be unlawful. It denominates as a\r\ncriminal every person who makes any such contract or engages in any\r\nsuch combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment by fine or\r\nimprisonment. It invests the several circuit courts of the United States\r\nwith jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of the act, and\r\nmakes it the duty of the several United States district attorneys, under\r\nthe direction of the Attorney-General, to institute proceedings in\r\nequity to prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon\r\nany person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other\r\nperson or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be\r\nunlawful by the act, the power to sue therefor in any circuit court of\r\nthe United States without respect to the amount in controversy, and to\r\nrecover threefold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the\r\nsuit, including reasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the\r\nact is aimed at every kind of combination in the nature of a trust or\r\nmonopoly in restraint of interstate or international commerce.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution by the United States of offenses under the act of 1890\r\nhas been frequently resorted to in the Federal courts, and notable\r\nefforts in the restraint of interstate commerce, such as the\r\nTrans-Missouri Freight Association and the Joint Traffic Association,\r\nhave been successfully opposed and suppressed.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland in his annual message of December 7, 1896--more than\r\nsix years subsequent to the enactment of this law--after stating the\r\nevils of these trust combinations, says:\r\n\r\n  Though Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation,\r\n  the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not\r\n  because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but\r\n  simply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not\r\n  reach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be\r\n  remedied by further legislation, it should be done. The fact must be\r\n  recognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may\r\n  fall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacles, and also\r\n  because of the complex character of our governmental system, which,\r\n  while making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has\r\n  carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be\r\n  transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question\r\n  renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can\r\n  be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they seek directly\r\n  and purposely to include in their objects transportation or intercourse\r\n  between States or between the United States and foreign countries.\r\n\r\n  It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that\r\n  may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal authority is\r\n  not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the\r\n  power of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and\r\n  there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously\r\n  exercise such power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State legislation to which President Cleveland looked for relief\r\nfrom the evils of trusts has failed to accomplish fully that object.\r\nThis is probably due to a great extent to the fact that different States\r\ntake different views as to the proper way to discriminate between evil\r\nand injurious combinations and those associations which are beneficial\r\nand necessary to the business prosperity of the country. The great\r\ndiversity of treatment in different States arising from this cause and\r\nthe intimate relations of all parts of the country to each other without\r\nregarding State lines in the conduct of business have made the\r\nenforcement of State laws difficult.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in\r\nthe several States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such\r\nuniformity founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is\r\ninjurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may\r\nbe obtained and that means may be found for the Congress within the\r\nlimitations of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective\r\ncode of State legislation as to make a complete system of laws\r\nthroughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of\r\nthe salutary rules to which I have referred.\r\n\r\nThe whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no\r\npart of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have\r\nthe studied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and\r\njudicious action.\r\n\r\nA review of our relations with foreign States is presented with such\r\nrecommendations as are deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and\r\nChile was settled in March last by the award of an arbitral commission,\r\non which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire.\r\n\r\nProgress has been made toward the conclusion of a convention of\r\nextradition with the Argentine Republic. Having been advised and\r\nconsented to by the United States Senate and ratified by Argentina, it\r\nonly awaits the adjustment of some slight changes in the text before\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I adverted to the claim of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government for indemnity for the killing of certain\r\nAustrian and Hungarian subjects by the authorities of the State of\r\nPennsylvania, at Lattimer, while suppressing an unlawful tumult of\r\nminers, September 10, 1897. In view of the verdict of acquittal rendered\r\nby the court before which the sheriff and his deputies were tried for\r\nmurder, and following the established doctrine that the Government may\r\nnot be held accountable for injuries suffered by individuals at the\r\nhands of the public authorities while acting in the line of duty in\r\nsuppressing disturbance of the public peace, this Government, after due\r\nconsideration of the claim advanced by the Austro-Hungarian Government,\r\nwas constrained to decline liability to indemnify the sufferers.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to announce that the Belgian Government has\r\nmitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle from the United\r\nStates, to which I referred in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nHaving been invited by Belgium to participate in a congress, held at\r\nBrussels, to revise the provisions of the general act of July 2, 1890,\r\nfor the repression of the African slave trade, to which the United\r\nStates was a signatory party, this Government preferred not to be\r\nrepresented by a plenipotentiary, but reserved the right of accession\r\nto the result. Notable changes were made, those especially concerning\r\nthis country being in the line of the increased restriction of the\r\ndeleterious trade in spirituous liquors with the native tribes, which\r\nthis Government has from the outset urgently advocated. The amended\r\ngeneral act will be laid before the Senate, with a view to its advice\r\nand consent.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the peace of Bolivia was disturbed by a successful\r\ninsurrection. The United States minister remained at his post, attending\r\nto the American interests in that quarter, and using besides his good\r\noffices for the protection of the interests of British subjects in the\r\nabsence of their national representative. On the establishment of the\r\nnew Government, our minister was directed to enter into relations\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pando was elected President of Bolivia on October 23.\r\n\r\nOur representative has been instructed to use all permissible friendly\r\nendeavors to induce the Government of Bolivia to amend its marriage laws\r\nso as to give legal status to the non-Catholic and civil marriages of\r\naliens within its jurisdiction, and strong hopes are entertained that\r\nthe Bolivian law in this regard will be brought, as was that of Peru\r\nsome years ago, into harmony with the general practice of modern States.\r\n\r\nA convention of extradition with Brazil, signed May 14, 1897, has been\r\nratified by the Brazilian Legislature.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer two national ships of the United States have\r\nvisited Brazilian ports on a friendly mission and been cordially\r\nreceived. The voyage of the _Wilmington_ up the Amazon River gave\r\nrise to a passing misunderstanding, owing to confusion in obtaining\r\npermission to visit the interior and make surveys in the general\r\ninterest of navigation, but the incident found a ready adjustment in\r\nharmony with the close relations of amity which this Government has\r\nalways sedulously sought to cultivate with the commonwealths of the\r\nWestern Continent.\r\n\r\nThe claim growing out of the seizure of the American-owned newspaper\r\n\"The Panama Star and Herald\" by the authorities of Colombia has been\r\nsettled, after a controversy of several years, by an agreement assessing\r\nat $30,000 the indemnity to be paid by the Colombian Government, in\r\nthree installments of $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nThe good will of Colombia toward our country has been testified anew by\r\nthe cordial extension of facilities to the Nicaraguan Canal Commission\r\nin their approaching investigation of the Panama Canal and other\r\nprojected routes across the Isthmus of Darien.\r\n\r\nToward the end of October an insurrectionary disturbance developed in\r\nthe Colombian Republic. This movement has thus far not attained any\r\ndecisive result and is still in progress.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the questions raised by the action of Denmark in imposing\r\nrestrictions on the importation of American meats has continued without\r\nsubstantial result in our favor.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring island Republic of Santo Domingo has lately been the\r\nscene of revolution, following a long period of tranquillity. It began\r\nwith the killing of President Heureaux in July last, and culminated in\r\nthe relinquishment by the succeeding Vice-President of the reins of\r\ngovernment to the insurgents. The first act of the provisional\r\ngovernment was the calling of a presidential and constituent election.\r\nJuan Isidro Jimenez, having been elected President, was inaugurated on\r\nthe 14th of November. Relations have been entered into with the newly\r\nestablished Government.\r\n\r\nThe experimental association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador, under\r\nthe title of the Greater Republic of Central America, when apparently on\r\nthe threshold of a complete federal organization by the adoption of a\r\nconstitution and the formation of a national legislature, was disrupted\r\nin the last days of November, 1898, by the withdrawal of Salvador.\r\nThereupon Nicaragua and Honduras abandoned the joint compact, each\r\nresuming its former independent sovereignty. This was followed by the\r\nreception of Minister Merry by the Republics of Nicaragua and Salvador,\r\nwhile Minister Hunter in turn presented his credentials to the\r\nGovernment of Honduras, thus reverting to the old distribution of the\r\ndiplomatic agencies of the United States in Central America for which\r\nour existing statutes provide. A Nicaraguan envoy has been accredited to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAn insurrectionary movement, under General Reyes, broke out at\r\nBluefields in February last, and for a time exercised actual control\r\nin the Mosquito Territory. The _Detroit_ was promptly sent thither\r\nfor the protection of American interests. After a few weeks the Reyes\r\ngovernment renounced the conflict, giving place to the restored\r\nsupremacy of Nicaragua. During the interregnum certain public dues\r\naccruing under Nicaraguan law were collected from American merchants by\r\nthe authorities for the time being in effective administrative control.\r\nUpon the titular government regaining power, a second payment of these\r\ndues was demanded. Controversy arose touching the validity of the\r\noriginal payment of the debt to the _de facto_ regent of the\r\nterritory. An arrangement was effected in April last by the United\r\nStates minister and the foreign secretary of Nicaragua whereby the\r\namounts of the duplicate payments were deposited with the British consul\r\npending an adjustment of the matter by direct agreement between the\r\nGovernments of the United States and Nicaragua. The controversy is still\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\nThe contract of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua was declared\r\nforfeited by the Nicaraguan Government on the 10th of October, on the\r\nground of nonfulfillment within the ten years' term stipulated in the\r\ncontract. The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against this\r\naction, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy of\r\nconsideration. This Government expects that Nicaragua will afford the\r\nprotestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal Commission, which had been engaged upon the work of\r\nexamination and survey for a ship-canal route across Nicaragua, having\r\ncompleted its labors and made its report, was dissolved on May 31, and\r\non June 10 a new commission, known as the Isthmian Canal Commission, was\r\norganized under the terms of the act approved March 3, 1899, for the\r\npurpose of examining the American Isthmus with a view to determining the\r\nmost practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that\r\nIsthmus, with its probable cost, and other essential details.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, under the presidency of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker,\r\nU.S.N. (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to it,\r\nand is now carrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of\r\nthe Panama Canal, and in Darien from the Atlantic, in the neighborhood\r\nof the Atrato River, to the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good\r\nprogress has been made, but under the law a comprehensive and complete\r\ninvestigation is called for, which will require much labor and\r\nconsiderable time for its accomplishment. The work will be prosecuted as\r\nexpeditiously as possible and a report made at the earliest practicable\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly\r\npressed upon the attention of the Congress. In my message of a year ago\r\nI expressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the\r\ntwo great oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The\r\nreasons then presented for early action are even stronger now.\r\n\r\nA pleasing incident in the relations of this Government with that\r\nof Chile occurred in the generous assistance given to the war ship\r\n_Newark_ when in distress in Chilean waters. Not alone in this way\r\nhas the friendly disposition of Chile found expression. That country has\r\nacceded to the convention for the establishment of the Bureau of the\r\nAmerican Republics, in which organization every independent State of the\r\ncontinent now shares.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of a convention for the revival of the\r\nUnited States and Chilean Claims Commission and for the adjudication of\r\nclaims heretofore presented but not determined during the life of the\r\nprevious Commission has been delayed by reason of the necessity for\r\nfresh action by the Chilean Senate upon the amendments attached to the\r\nratification of the treaty by the United States Senate. This formality\r\nis soon to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn view of disturbances in the populous provinces of northern China,\r\nwhere are many of our citizens, and of the imminence of disorder near\r\nthe capital and toward the seaboard, a guard of marines was landed\r\nfrom the _Boston_ and stationed during last winter in the legation\r\ncompound at Peking. With the restoration of order this protection was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe interests of our citizens in that vast Empire have not been neglected\r\nduring the past year. Adequate protection has been secured for our\r\nmissionaries and some injuries to their property have been redressed.\r\n\r\nAmerican capital has sought and found various opportunities of competing\r\nto carry out the internal improvements which the Imperial Government is\r\nwisely encouraging, and to develop the natural resources of the Empire.\r\nOur trade with China has continued to grow, and our commercial rights\r\nunder existing treaties have been everywhere maintained during the past\r\nyear, as they will be in the future.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the area open to international foreign settlement at\r\nShanghai and the opening of the ports of Nanking, Tsing-tao (Kiao chao),\r\nand Ta-lien-wan to foreign trade and settlement will doubtless afford\r\nAmerican enterprise additional facilities and new fields, of which it\r\nwill not be slow to take advantage.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress of December 5, 1898, I urged that the\r\nrecommendation which had been made to the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of June,\r\n1898, for an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial\r\nand industrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the\r\nopportunities for, and obstacles to, the enlargement of markets in China\r\nfor the raw products and manufactures of the United States, should\r\nreceive at your hands the consideration which its importance and\r\ntimeliness merited, but the Congress failed to take action.\r\n\r\nI now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has\r\nsteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should\r\nbe lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for\r\nAmerican trade and enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe death of President Faure in February last called forth those sincere\r\nexpressions of sympathy which befit the relations of two Republics as\r\nclosely allied by unbroken historic ties as are the United States and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the representation of the industries, arts, and\r\nproducts of the United States at the World's Exposition to be held in\r\nParis next year continue on an elaborate and comprehensive scale, thanks\r\nto the generous appropriation provided by Congress and to the friendly\r\ninterest the French Government has shown in furthering a typical exhibit\r\nof American progress.\r\n\r\nThere has been allotted to the United States a considerable addition\r\nof space, which, while placing our country in the first rank among\r\nexhibitors, does not suffice to meet the increasingly urgent demands\r\nof our manufacturers. The efforts of the Commissioner-General are ably\r\ndirected toward a strictly representative display of all that most\r\ncharacteristically marks American achievement in the inventive arts,\r\nand most adequately shows the excellence of our natural productions.\r\n\r\nIn this age of keen rivalry among nations for mastery in commerce, the\r\ndoctrine of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fittest must\r\nbe as inexorable in their operation as they are positive in the results\r\nthey bring about. The place won in the struggle by an industrial people\r\ncan only be held by unrelaxed endeavor and constant advance in\r\nachievement. The present extraordinary impetus in every line of American\r\nexportation and the astounding increase in the volume and value of our\r\nshare in the world's markets may not be attributed to accidental\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. They lie deep in our national character\r\nand find expression year by year in every branch of handicraft, in every\r\nnew device whereby the materials we so abundantly produce are subdued to\r\nthe artisan's will and made to yield the largest, most practical, and\r\nmost beneficial return. The American exhibit at Paris should, and I am\r\nconfident will, be an open volume, whose lessons of skillfully directed\r\nendeavor, unfaltering energy, and consummate performance may be read by\r\nall on every page, thus spreading abroad a clearer knowledge of the\r\nworth of our productions and the justice of our claim to an important\r\nplace in the marts of the world. To accomplish this by judicious\r\nselection, by recognition of paramount merit in whatever walk of trade\r\nor manufacture it may appear, and by orderly classification and\r\nattractive installation is the task of our Commission.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government building is approaching completion, and no\r\neffort will be spared to make it worthy, in beauty of architectural plan\r\nand in completeness of display, to represent our nation. It has been\r\nsuggested that a permanent building of similar or appropriate design be\r\nerected on a convenient site, already given by the municipality, near\r\nthe exposition grounds, to serve in commemoration of the part taken by\r\nthis country in this great enterprise, as an American National\r\nInstitute, for our countrymen resorting to Paris for study.\r\n\r\nI am informed by our Commissioner-General that we shall have in the\r\nAmerican sections at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors, from every State in\r\nour country, a number ten times as great as those which were represented\r\nat Vienna in 1873, six times as many as those in Paris in 1878, and four\r\ntimes as many as those who exhibited in Paris in 1889. This statement\r\ndoes not include the exhibits from either Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii,\r\nfor which arrangements have been made.\r\n\r\nA number of important international congresses on special topics\r\naffecting public interests are proposed to be held in Paris next summer\r\nin connection with the exposition. Effort will be made to have the\r\nseveral technical branches of our administration efficiently represented\r\nat those conferences, each in its special line, and to procure the\r\nlargest possible concourse of State representatives, particularly at the\r\nCongresses of Public Charity and Medicine.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Germany continue to be most cordial. The increasing\r\nintimacy of direct association has been marked during the year by the\r\ngranting permission in April for the landing on our shores of a cable\r\nfrom Borkum Eniden, on the North Sea, by way of the Azores, and also\r\nby the conclusion on September 2 of a Parcels Post Convention with the\r\nGerman Empire. In all that promises closer relations of intercourse and\r\ncommerce and a better understanding between two races having so many\r\ntraits in common, Germany can be assured of the most cordial cooperation\r\nof this Government and people. We may be rivals in many material paths,\r\nbut our rivalry should be generous and open, ever aiming toward the\r\nattainment of larger results and the mutually beneficial advancement of\r\neach in the line of its especial adaptabilities.\r\n\r\nThe several governments of the Empire seem reluctant to admit the\r\nnatural excellence of our food productions and to accept the evidence\r\nwe constantly tender of the care with which their purity is guarded\r\nby rigid inspection from the farm, through the slaughterhouse and the\r\npacking establishments, to the port of shipment. Our system of control\r\nover exported food staples invites examination from any quarter and\r\nchallenges respect by its efficient thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that in time the two Governments will act in common\r\naccord toward the realization of their common purpose to safeguard the\r\npublic health and to insure the purity and wholesomeness of all food\r\nproducts imported by either country from the other. Were the Congress\r\nto authorize an invitation to Germany, in connection with the pending\r\nreciprocity negotiations, for the constitution of a joint commission of\r\nscientific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct a searching\r\ninvestigation of food production and exportation in both countries and\r\nreport to their respective legislatures for the adoption of such\r\nremedial measures as they might recommend for either, the way might be\r\nopened for the desirable result indicated.\r\n\r\nEfforts to obtain for American life insurance companies a full hearing\r\nas to their business operations in Prussia have, after several years of\r\npatient representation, happily succeeded, and one of the most important\r\nAmerican companies has been granted a concession to continue business in\r\nthat Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am also glad to announce that the German insurance companies have been\r\nreadmitted by the superintendent of insurance to do business in the\r\nState of New York.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the exchange of our peace treaty with Spain, Germany\r\nacquired the Caroline Islands by purchase, paying therefor $5,000,000.\r\nAssurances have been received from the German Government that the rights\r\nof American missionaries and traders there will be considerately\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I referred to the pending negotiations with\r\nGreat Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an\r\nexecutive agreement, a Joint High Commission had been created for the\r\npurpose of adjusting all unsettled questions between the United States\r\nand Canada, embracing twelve subjects, among which were the questions of\r\nthe fur seals, the fisheries of the coast and contiguous inland waters,\r\nthe Alaskan boundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien\r\nlabor laws, mining rights, reciprocity in trade, revision of the\r\nagreement respecting naval vessels in the Great Lakes, a more complete\r\nmarking of parts of the boundary, provision for the conveyance of\r\ncriminals, and for wrecking and salvage.\r\n\r\nMuch progress had been made by the Commission toward the adjustment of\r\nmany of these questions, when it became apparent that an irreconcilable\r\ndifference of views was entertained respecting the delimitation of the\r\nAlaskan boundary. In the failure of an agreement as to the meaning of\r\nArticles III and IV of the treaty of 1825 between Russia and Great\r\nBritain, which defined the boundary between Alaska and Canada, the\r\nAmerican Commissioners proposed that the subject of the boundary be\r\nlaid aside, and that the remaining questions of difference be proceeded\r\nwith, some of which were so far advanced as to assure the probability\r\nof a settlement. This being declined by the British Commissioners, an\r\nadjournment was taken until the boundary should be adjusted by the two\r\nGovernments. The subject has been receiving the careful attention which\r\nits importance demands, with the result that a _modus vivendi_ for\r\nprovisional demarcations in the region about the head of Lynn Canal has\r\nbeen agreed upon; and it is hoped that the negotiations now in progress\r\nbetween the two Governments will end in an agreement for the\r\nestablishment and delimitation of a permanent boundary.\r\n\r\nApart from these questions growing out of our relationship with our\r\nnorthern neighbor, the most friendly disposition and ready agreement\r\nhave marked the discussion of numerous matters arising in the vast and\r\nintimate intercourse of the United States with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis Government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the\r\nunfortunate contest between Great Britain and the Boer States of\r\nAfrica. We have remained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling\r\nalliances as to affairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances\r\nsuggested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly\r\nexpression of the hope of the American people that war might be averted,\r\ngood offices would have been gladly tendered. The United States\r\nrepresentative at Pretoria was early instructed to see that all neutral\r\nAmerican interests be respected by the combatants. This has been an easy\r\ntask in view of the positive declarations of both British and Boer\r\nauthorities that the personal and property rights of our citizens should\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\nUpon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United States\r\nconsul was authorized, upon the request of the British Government and\r\nwith the assent of the South African and Orange Free State Governments,\r\nto exercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of\r\nBritish interests. In the discharge of this function, I am happy to say\r\nthat abundant opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of\r\nthis Government toward both the combatants.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time in the present decade, question has arisen with\r\nthe Government of Italy in regard to the lynching of Italian subjects.\r\nThe latest of these deplorable events occurred at Tallulah, Louisiana,\r\nwhereby five unfortunates of Italian origin were taken from jail and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the State and a representative of the Italian Embassy\r\nhaving separately investigated the occurrence, with discrepant results,\r\nparticularly as to the alleged citizenship of the victims, and it not\r\nappearing that the State had been able to discover and punish the\r\nviolators of the law, an independent investigation has been set on foot,\r\nthrough the agency of the Department of State, and is still in progress.\r\nThe result will enable the Executive to treat the question with the\r\nGovernment of Italy in a spirit of fairness and justice. A satisfactory\r\nsolution will doubtless be reached.\r\n\r\nThe recurrence of these distressing manifestations of blind mob fury\r\ndirected at dependents or natives of a foreign country suggests that\r\nthe contingency has arisen for action by Congress in the direction\r\nof conferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of\r\ninternational cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment may be involved. The suggestion is not new. In his annual\r\nmessage of December 9, 1891, my predecessor, President Harrison, said:\r\n\r\n  It would, I believe, be entirely competent for Congress to make offenses\r\n  against the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States\r\n  cognizable in the Federal courts. This has not, however, been done, and\r\n  the Federal officers and courts have no power in such cases to intervene\r\n  either for the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of\r\n  his slayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state of the law, that\r\n  the officers of the State charged with police and judicial powers in\r\n  such cases must, in the consideration of international questions growing\r\n  out of such incidents, be regarded in such sense as Federal agents as to\r\n  make this Government answerable for their acts in cases where it would\r\n  be answerable if the United States had used its constitutional power to\r\n  define and punish crimes against treaty rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bill to provide for the punishment of violations of treaty rights\r\nof aliens was introduced in the Senate March 1, 1892, and reported\r\nfavorably March 30. Having doubtless in view the language of that part\r\nof Article III of the treaty of February 26, 1871, between the United\r\nStates and Italy, which stipulates that \"The citizens of each of the\r\nhigh contracting parties shall receive, in the States and Territories of\r\nthe other, most constant protection and security for their persons and\r\nproperty, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges\r\nas are or shall be granted to the natives, on their submitting\r\nthemselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives,\" the bill so\r\nintroduced and reported provided that any act committed in any State or\r\nTerritory of the United States in violation of the rights of a citizen\r\nor subject of a foreign country secured to such citizen or subject\r\nby treaty between the United States and such foreign country and\r\nconstituting a crime under the laws of the State or Territory shall\r\nconstitute a like crime against the United States and be cognizable in\r\nthe Federal courts. No action was taken by Congress in the matter.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that the subject be taken up anew and acted\r\nupon during the present session. The necessity for some such provision\r\nabundantly appears. Precedent for constituting a Federal jurisdiction in\r\ncriminal cases where aliens are sufferers is rationally deducible from\r\nthe existing statute, which gives to the district and circuit courts of\r\nthe United States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by aliens where\r\nthe amount involved exceeds a certain sum. If such jealous solicitude be\r\nshown for alien rights in cases of merely civil and pecuniary import,\r\nhow much greater should be the public duty to take cognizance of matters\r\naffecting the lives and the rights of aliens under the settled\r\nprinciples of international law no less than under treaty stipulation,\r\nin cases of such transcendent wrongdoing as mob murder, especially when\r\nexperience has shown that local justice is too often helpless to punish\r\nthe offenders.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of endeavor on the part of this Government to that end\r\nthe Italian Government has consented to enter into negotiations for a\r\nnaturalization convention, having for one of its objects the regulation\r\nof the status of Italians (except those of an age for active military\r\nservice) who, having been naturalized in the United States, may revisit\r\nItaly. It is hoped that with the mutually conciliatory spirit displayed\r\na successful conclusion will be reached.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and\r\nJapan on November 22, 1894, took effect in accordance with the terms\r\nof its XIXth Article on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with the\r\nenforcement of like treaties with the other powers, except France, whose\r\nconvention did not go into operation until August 4, the United States\r\nbeing, however, granted up to that date all the privileges and rights\r\naccorded to French citizens under the old French treaty. By this notable\r\nconventional reform Japan's position as a fully independent sovereign\r\npower is assured, control being gained of taxation, customs revenues,\r\njudicial administration, coasting trade, and all other domestic\r\nfunctions of government, and foreign extra-territorial rights being\r\nrenounced.\r\n\r\nComprehensive codes of civil and criminal procedure according to\r\nwestern methods, public instruction, patents and copyrights, municipal\r\nadministration, including jurisdiction over the former foreign\r\nsettlements, customs tariffs and procedure, public health, and other\r\nadministrative measures have been proclaimed. The working of the new\r\nsystem has given rise to no material complaints on the part of the\r\nAmerican citizens or interests, a circumstance which attests the ripe\r\nconsideration with which the change has been prepared.\r\n\r\nValuable assistance was rendered by the Japanese authorities to the\r\nUnited States transport ship _Morgan City_ while stranded at Kobe.\r\nPermission has been granted to land and pasture army horses at Japanese\r\nports of call on the way to the Philippine Islands. These kindly\r\nevidences of good will are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government has shown a lively interest in the proposition\r\nof the Pacific Cable Company to add to its projected cable lines to\r\nHawaii, Guam, and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of\r\nJapan. It would be a gratifying consummation were the utility of the\r\ncontemplated scheme enhanced by bringing Japan and the United States\r\ninto direct telegraphic relation.\r\n\r\nWithout repeating the observations of my special message of February 10,\r\n1899, concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila, I respectfully\r\ninvite attention to it.\r\n\r\nI recommend that, in case the Congress should not take measures\r\nto bring about this result by direct action of the Government, the\r\nPostmaster-General be authorized to invite competitive bids for the\r\nestablishment of a cable; the company making the best responsible bid to\r\nbe awarded the contract; the successful company to give ample bonds to\r\ninsure the completion of the work within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nThe year has been marked by constant increase in the intimacy of our\r\nrelations with Mexico and in the magnitude of mutually advantageous\r\ninterchanges. This Government has omitted no opportunity to show its\r\nstrong desire to develop and perpetuate the ties of cordiality now so\r\nlong happily unbroken.\r\n\r\nFollowing the termination on January 20, 1899, by Mexico of the\r\nconvention of extradition of December 11, 1861, a new treaty more in\r\naccordance with the ascertained needs of both countries was signed\r\nFebruary 22, 1899, and exchanged in the City of Mexico on the 22d of\r\nApril last. Its operation thus far has been effective and satisfactory.\r\nA recent case has served to test the application of its IVth Article,\r\nwhich provides that neither party shall be bound to deliver up its own\r\ncitizens, but that the executive authority of each shall have the power\r\nto deliver them up if in its discretion it be deemed proper to do so.\r\n\r\nThe extradition of Mrs. Mattie Rich, a citizen of the United\r\nStates, charged with homicide committed in Mexico, was after mature\r\nconsideration directed by me in the conviction that the ends of justice\r\nwould be thereby subserved. Similar action, on appropriate occasion,\r\nby the Mexican Executive will not only tend to accomplish the desire\r\nof both Governments that grave crimes go not unpunished, but also to\r\nrepress lawlessness along the border of the two countries. The new\r\ntreaty stipulates that neither Government shall assume jurisdiction in\r\nthe punishment of crimes committed exclusively within the territory of\r\nthe other. This will obviate in future the embarrassing controversies\r\nwhich have heretofore arisen through Mexico's assertion of a claim to\r\ntry and punish an American citizen for an offense committed within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe International Water Boundary Commission, organized by the convention\r\nof March 1, 1889, for the adjustment of questions affecting the Rio\r\nGrande frontier, has not yet completed its labors. A further extension\r\nof its term for one year, until December 24, 1899, was effected by a\r\nconvention signed December 2, 1898, and exchanged and proclaimed in\r\nFebruary last.\r\n\r\nAn invitation extended to the President of Mexico to visit Chicago in\r\nOctober, on the occasion of laying the corner stone of the United States\r\nGovernment building in that city, was cordially accepted by him, with\r\nthe necessary consent of the Mexican Congress, but the illness of a\r\nmember of his family prevented his attendance. The Minister of Foreign\r\nRelations, however, came as the personal representative of President\r\nDiaz, and in that high character was duly honored.\r\n\r\nClaims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering\r\nSea have been under discussion with the Government of Russia for several\r\nyears, with the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to\r\nthe decision of a single arbitrator. By this act Russia affords proof\r\nof her adherence to the beneficent principle of arbitration which her\r\nplenipotentiaries conspicuously favored at The Hague Disarmament\r\nConference when it was advocated by the representatives of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for a permanent exposition of our products and manufactures\r\nin Russia, although not yet fully shaped, has been so cordially welcomed\r\nby the Imperial Government that it may not inaptly take a fitting place\r\nin whatever legislation the Congress may adopt looking to enlargement of\r\nour commercial opportunities abroad.\r\n\r\nImportant events have occurred in the Samoan Islands. The election,\r\naccording to the laws and customs of Samoa, of a successor to the late\r\nKing, Malietoa Laupepa, developed a contest as to the validity of the\r\nresult, which issue, by the terms of the General Act, was to be decided\r\nby the Chief Justice. Upon his rendering a judgment in favor of Malietoa\r\nTanu, the rival chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The active intervention of\r\nAmerican and British war ships became imperative to restore order, at\r\nthe cost of sanguinary encounters. In this emergency a joint commission\r\nof representatives of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain\r\nwas sent to Samoa to investigate the situation and provide a temporary\r\nremedy. By its active efforts a peaceful solution was reached for the\r\ntime being, the kingship being abolished and a provisional government\r\nestablished. Recommendations unanimously made by the commission\r\nfor a permanent adjustment of the Samoan question were taken under\r\nconsideration by the three powers parties to the General Act. But the\r\nmore they were examined the more evident it became that a radical change\r\nwas necessary in the relations of the powers to Samoa.\r\n\r\nThe inconveniences and possible perils of the tripartite scheme of\r\nsupervision and control in the Samoan group by powers having little\r\ninterest in common in that quarter beyond commercial rivalry had been\r\nonce more emphasized by the recent events. The suggested remedy of the\r\nJoint Commission, like the scheme it aimed to replace, amounted to\r\nwhat has been styled a _tridominium_, being the exercise of the\r\nfunctions of sovereignty by an unanimous agreement of three powers.\r\nThe situation had become far more intricate and embarrassing from every\r\npoint of view than it was when my predecessor, in 1894, summed up its\r\nperplexities and condemned the participation in it of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement under which Samoa was administered had proved\r\nimpracticable and unacceptable to all the powers concerned. To withdraw\r\nfrom the agreement and abandon the islands to Germany and Great Britain\r\nwould not be compatible with our interests in the archipelago. To\r\nrelinquish our rights in the harbor of Pago Pago, the best anchorage in\r\nthe Pacific, the occupancy of which had been leased to the United States\r\nin 1878 by the first foreign treaty ever concluded by Samoa, was not to\r\nbe thought of either as regards the needs of our Navy or the interests\r\nof our growing commerce with the East. We could not have considered any\r\nproposition for the abrogation of the tripartite control which did not\r\nconfirm us in all our rights and safeguard all our national interests in\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nOur views commended themselves to the other powers. A satisfactory\r\narrangement was concluded between the Governments of Germany and of\r\nEngland, by virtue of which England retired from Samoa in view of\r\ncompensations in other directions, and both powers renounced in favor\r\nof the United States all their rights and claims over and in respect\r\nto that portion of the group lying to the east of the one hundred\r\nand seventy-first degree of west longitude, embracing the islands of\r\nTutuila, Ofoo, Olosenga, and Manua. I transmit to the Senate, for\r\nits constitutional action thereon, a convention, which besides the\r\nprovisions above mentioned also guarantees us the same privileges and\r\nconditions in respect to commerce and commercial vessels in all of the\r\nislands of Samoa as those possessed by Germany.\r\n\r\nClaims have been preferred by white residents of Samoa on account of\r\ninjuries alleged to have been suffered through the acts of the treaty\r\nGovernments in putting down the late disturbances. A convention has been\r\nmade between the three powers for the investigation and settlement of\r\nthese claims by a neutral arbitrator, to which the attention of the\r\nSenate will be invited.\r\n\r\nMy annual message of last year was necessarily devoted in great part to\r\na consideration of the Spanish War and of the results it wrought and the\r\nconditions it imposed for the future. I am gratified to announce that\r\nthe treaty of peace has restored friendly relations between the two\r\npowers. Effect has been given to its most important provisions. The\r\nevacuation of Puerto Rico having already been accomplished on the 18th\r\nof October, 1898, nothing remained necessary there but to continue the\r\nprovisional military control of the island until the Congress should\r\nenact a suitable government for the ceded territory. Of the character\r\nand scope of the measures to that end I shall treat in another part of\r\nthis message.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba was\r\neffected by the 1st of January, so that the full re-establishment of\r\npeace found the relinquished territory held by us in trust for the\r\ninhabitants, maintaining, under the direction of the Executive, such\r\ngovernment and control therein as should conserve public order, restore\r\nthe productive conditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability\r\nand disorder which prevailed for the greater part of the preceding three\r\ndecades, and build up that tranquil development of the domestic state\r\nwhereby alone can be realized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the\r\njoint resolution adopted by the Congress on the 19th of April, 1898,\r\nby which the United States disclaimed any disposition or intention to\r\nexercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over Cuba, except for\r\nthe pacification thereof, and asserted its determination when that was\r\naccomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its\r\npeople. The pledge contained in this resolution is of the highest\r\nhonorable obligation and must be sacredly kept.\r\n\r\nI believe that substantial progress has been made in this direction.\r\nAll the administrative measures adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for\r\na regenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy of law and justice;\r\nby placing wherever practicable the machinery of administration in the\r\nhands of the inhabitants; by instituting needed sanitary reforms; by\r\nspreading education; by fostering industry and trade; by inculcating\r\npublic morality, and, in short, by taking every rational step to aid\r\nthe Cuban people to attain to that plane of self-conscious respect\r\nand self-reliant unity which fits an enlightened community for\r\nself-government within its own sphere, while enabling it to fulfill\r\nall outward obligations.\r\n\r\nThis nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the\r\nfuture good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust the fulfillment\r\nof which calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of\r\nthe highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past\r\nmust needs be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength\r\nif its enduring welfare is to be assured. Whether those ties shall be\r\norganic or conventional, the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful\r\nform and manner irrevocably linked with our own, but how and how far\r\nis for the future to determine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be\r\nthe outcome, we must see to it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name,\r\na perfect entity, not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the\r\nelements of failure. Our mission, to accomplish which we took up the\r\nwager of battle, is not to be fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely\r\nframed commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which too often attend\r\nweaker States whose natural wealth and abundant resources are offset\r\nby the incongruities of their political organization and the recurring\r\noccasions for internal rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate\r\ntheir energies. The greatest blessing which can come to Cuba is the\r\nrestoration of her agricultural and industrial prosperity, which will\r\ngive employment to idle men and re-establish the pursuits of peace.\r\nThis is her chief and immediate need.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August last an order was made for the taking of the\r\ncensus in the island, to be completed on the 30th of November. By the\r\ntreaty of peace the Spanish people on the island have until April 11,\r\n1900, to elect whether they will remain citizens of Spain or become\r\ncitizens of Cuba. Until then it cannot be definitely ascertained who\r\nshall be entitled to participate in the formation of the government of\r\nCuba. By that time the results of the census will have been tabulated\r\nand we shall proceed to provide for elections which will commit the\r\nmunicipal governments of the island to the officers elected by the\r\npeople. The experience thus acquired will prove of great value in the\r\nformation of a representative convention of the people to draft a\r\nconstitution and establish a general system of independent government\r\nfor the island. In the meantime and so long as we exercise control over\r\nthe island the products of Cuba should have a market in the United\r\nStates on as good terms and with as favorable rates of duty as are given\r\nto the West India Islands under treaties of reciprocity which shall be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nFor the relief of the distressed in the island of Cuba the War\r\nDepartment has issued supplies to destitute persons through the officers\r\nof the Army, which have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a cost of\r\n$1,417,554.07.\r\n\r\nTo promote the disarmament of the Cuban volunteer army, and in the\r\ninterest of public peace and the welfare of the people, the sum of $75\r\nwas paid to each Cuban soldier borne upon the authenticated rolls,\r\non condition that he should deposit his arms with the authorities\r\ndesignated by the United States. The sum thus disbursed aggregated\r\n$2,547,750, which was paid from the emergency fund provided by the act\r\nof January 5, 1899, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOut of the Cuban island revenues during the six months ending June 30,\r\n1899, $1,712,014.20 was expended for sanitation, $293,881.70 for\r\ncharities and hospitals, and $88,944.03 for aid to the destitute.\r\n\r\nFollowing the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace the\r\ntwo Governments accredited ministers to each other, Spain sending\r\nto Washington the Duke of Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, previously\r\nstationed in Mexico, while the United States transferred to Madrid Hon.\r\nBellamy Storer, its minister at Brussels. This was followed by the\r\nrespective appointment of consuls, thereby fully resuming the relations\r\ninterrupted by the war. In addition to its consular representation in\r\nthe United States, the Spanish Government has appointed consuls for\r\nCuba, who have been provisionally recognized during the military\r\nadministration of the affairs of that island.\r\n\r\nJudicial intercourse between the courts of Cuba and Puerto Rico and of\r\nSpain has been established, as provided by the treaty of peace. The\r\nCuban political prisoners in Spanish penal stations have been and are\r\nbeing released and returned to their homes, in accordance with Article\r\nVI of the treaty. Negotiations are about to be had for defining the\r\nconventional relations between the two countries, which fell into\r\nabeyance by reason of the war. I trust that these will include a\r\nfavorable arrangement for commercial reciprocity under the terms of\r\nsections 3 and 4 of the current tariff act. In these, as in all matters\r\nof international concern, no effort will be spared to respond to the\r\ngood disposition of Spain, and to cultivate in all practicable ways the\r\nintimacy which should prevail between two nations whose past history has\r\nso often and in so many ways been marked by sincere friendship and by\r\ncommunity of interests.\r\n\r\nI would recommend appropriate legislation in order to carry into\r\nexecution Article VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the\r\nUnited States assured the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its\r\ncitizens against Spain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe United States minister to Turkey continues, under instructions,\r\nto press for a money payment in satisfaction of the just claims for\r\ninjuries suffered by American citizens in the disorders of several years\r\npast and for wrongs done to them by the Ottoman authorities. Some of\r\nthese claims are of many years' standing. This Government is hopeful of\r\na general agreement in this regard.\r\n\r\nIn the Turkish Empire the situation of our citizens remains\r\nunsatisfactory. Our efforts during nearly forty years to bring about a\r\nconvention of naturalization seem to be on the brink of final failure\r\nthrough the announced policy of the Ottoman Porte to refuse recognition\r\nof the alien status of native Turkish subjects naturalized abroad since\r\n1867. Our statutes do not allow this Government to admit any distinction\r\nbetween the treatment of native and naturalized Americans abroad, so\r\nthat ceaseless controversy arises in cases where persons owing in the\r\neye of international law a dual allegiance are prevented from entering\r\nTurkey or are expelled after entrance. Our law in this regard contrasts\r\nwith that of the European States. The British act, for instance, does\r\nnot claim effect for the naturalization of an alien in the event of his\r\nreturn to his native country, unless the change be recognized by the law\r\nof that country or stipulated by treaty between it and the naturalizing\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary treatment, in some instances, of American productions in\r\nTurkey has attracted attention of late, notably in regard to our flour.\r\nLarge shipments by the recently opened direct steamship line to Turkish\r\nports have been denied entrance on the score that, although of standard\r\ncomposition and unquestioned purity, the flour was pernicious to health\r\nbecause of deficient \"elasticity\" as indicated by antiquated and\r\nuntrustworthy tests. Upon due protest by the American minister, and it\r\nappearing that the act was a virtual discrimination against our product,\r\nthe shipments in question were admitted. In these, as in all instances,\r\nwherever occurring, when American products may be subjected in a foreign\r\ncountry, upon specious pretexts, to discrimination compared with the\r\nlike products of another country, this Government will use its earnest\r\nefforts to secure fair and equal treatment for its citizens and their\r\ngoods. Failing this, it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective\r\nmay be provided by the statutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe International Commission of Arbitration, appointed under the\r\nAnglo-Venezuelan treaty of 1897, rendered an award on October 3 last,\r\nwhereby the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana is\r\ndetermined, thus ending a controversy which has existed for the greater\r\npart of the century. The award, as to which the arbitrators were\r\nunanimous, while not meeting the extreme contention of either party,\r\ngives to Great Britain a large share of the interior territory in\r\ndispute and to Venezuela the entire mouth of the Orinoco, including\r\nBarima Point and the Caribbean littoral for some distance to the\r\neastward. The decision appears to be equally satisfactory to both\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nVenezuela has once more undergone a revolution. The insurgents, under\r\nGeneral Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in which they suffered\r\nmuch loss, rallied in the mountainous interior and advanced toward the\r\ncapital. The bulk of the army having sided with the movement, President\r\nAndrade quitted Caracas, where General Castro set up a provisional\r\ngovernment with which our minister and the representatives of other\r\npowers entered into diplomatic relations on the 20th of November, 1899.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the Tariff Act approved July 24, 1897, appears\r\nto provide only for commercial treaties which should be entered into by\r\nthe President and also ratified by the Senate within two years from its\r\npassage. Owing to delays inevitable in negotiations of this nature, none\r\nof the treaties initiated under that section could be concluded in time\r\nfor ratification by the Senate prior to its adjournment on the 4th of\r\nMarch last. Some of the pending negotiations, however, were near\r\nconclusion at that time, and the resulting conventions have since been\r\nsigned by the plenipotentiaries. Others, within both the third and\r\nfourth sections of the act, are still under consideration. Acting under\r\nthe constitutional power of the Executive in respect to treaties,\r\nI have deemed it my duty, while observing the limitations of concession\r\nprovided by the fourth section, to bring to a conclusion all pending\r\nnegotiations, and submit them to the Senate for its advice and consent.\r\n\r\nConventions of reciprocity have been signed during the Congressional\r\nrecess with Great Britain for the respective colonies of British Guiana,\r\nBarbados, Bermuda, Jamaica, and Turks and Caicos Islands, and with the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nImportant reciprocal conventions have also been concluded with France\r\nand with the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the progress noted in the work of the\r\ndiplomatic and consular officers in collecting information as to\r\nthe industries and commerce of other countries, and in the care and\r\npromptitude with which their reports are printed and distributed, has\r\ncontinued during the past year, with increasingly valuable results in\r\nsuggesting new sources of demand for American products and in pointing\r\nout the obstacles still to be overcome in facilitating the remarkable\r\nexpansion of our foreign trade. It will doubtless be gratifying to\r\nCongress to learn that the various agencies of the Department of State\r\nare co-operating in these endeavors with a zeal and effectiveness\r\nwhich are not only receiving the cordial recognition of our business\r\ninterests, but are exciting the emulation of other Governments. In any\r\nrearrangement of the great and complicated work of obtaining official\r\ndata of an economic character which Congress may undertake it is most\r\nimportant, in my judgment, that the results already secured by the\r\nefforts of the Department of State should be carefully considered with\r\na view to a judicious development and increased utility to our export\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by the various States forming the International Union\r\nof American Republics in the work of its organic bureau is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that for the first time since its creation in 1890 all the\r\nRepublics of South and Central America are now represented in it.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous recommendation of the International American Conference,\r\nproviding for the International Union of American Republics, stated that\r\nit should continue in force during a term of ten years from the date of\r\nits organization, and no country becoming a member of the union should\r\ncease to be a member until the end of said period of ten years, and\r\nunless twelve months before the expiration of said period a majority\r\nof the members of the union had given to the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States official notice of their wish to terminate the union\r\nat the end of its first period, that the union should continue to be\r\nmaintained for another period of ten years, and thereafter, under the\r\nsame conditions, for successive periods of ten years each.\r\n\r\nThe period for notification expired on July 14, 1899, without any of the\r\nmembers having given the necessary notice of withdrawal. Its maintenance\r\nis therefore assured for the next ten years. In view of this fact and of\r\nthe numerous questions of general interest and common benefit to all of\r\nthe Republics of America, some of which were considered by the first\r\nInternational American Conference, but not finally settled, and others\r\nwhich have since then grown to importance, it would seem expedient that\r\nthe various Republics constituting the Union should be invited to hold\r\nat an early date another conference in the capital of one of the\r\ncountries other than the United States, which has already enjoyed this\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nThe purely international character of the work being done by the\r\nbureau and the appreciation of its value are further emphasized by the\r\nactive co-operation which the various Governments of the Latin-American\r\nRepublics and their diplomatic representatives in this capital are now\r\nexhibiting and the zealous endeavors they are making to extend its\r\nfield of usefulness, to promote through it commercial intercourse, and\r\nstrengthen the bonds of amity and confidence between its various members\r\nand the nations of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe act to encourage the holding of the Pan-American Exposition on the\r\nNiagara frontier, within the county of Erie or Niagara, in the State of\r\nNew York, in the year 1901, was approved on March 3, 1899.\r\n\r\nThis exposition, which will be held in the city of Buffalo, in the near\r\nvicinity of the great Niagara cataract, and within a day's journey of\r\nwhich reside 40,000,000 of our people, will be confined entirely to the\r\nWestern Hemisphere. Satisfactory assurances have already been given by\r\nthe diplomatic representatives of Great Britain, Mexico, the Central and\r\nSouth American Republics, and most of the States of the United States\r\nthat these countries and States will make an unique, interesting, and\r\ninstructive exhibit, peculiarly illustrative of their material progress\r\nduring the century which is about to close.\r\n\r\nThe law provides an appropriation of $500,000 for the purpose of making\r\nan exhibit at the exposition by the Government of the United States\r\nfrom its Executive Departments and from the Smithsonian Institution and\r\nNational Museum, the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, the\r\nDepartment of Labor, and the Bureau of the American Republics. To secure\r\na complete and harmonious arrangement of this Government exhibit a board\r\nof management has already been created, and charged with the selection,\r\npurchase, preparation, transportation, arrangement, and safe-keeping\r\nof the articles and materials to be exhibited. This board has been\r\norganized and has already entered upon the performance of its duties,\r\nas provided for by the law.\r\n\r\nI have every reason to hope and believe that this exposition will tend\r\nmore firmly to cement the cordial relations between the nations on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an act of Congress approved December 21, 1898,\r\nand under the auspices of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, a most\r\ninteresting and valuable exposition of products and manufactures\r\nespecially adapted to export trade was held in Philadelphia from the\r\n14th of September to the 1st of December, 1899. The representative\r\ncharacter of the exhibits and the widespread interest manifested in the\r\nspecial objects of the undertaking afford renewed encouragement to those\r\nwho look confidently to the steady growth of our enlarged exportation\r\nof manufactured goods, which has been the most remarkable fact in the\r\neconomic development of the United States in recent years. A feature of\r\nthis exposition which is likely to become of permanent and increasing\r\nutility to our industries is the collection of samples of merchandise\r\nproduced in various countries with special reference to particular\r\nmarkets, providing practical object lessons to United States\r\nmanufacturers as to qualities, styles, and prices of goods such as meet\r\nthe special demands of consumers and may be exported with advantage.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the exposition an International Commercial\r\nCongress was held, upon the invitation of the Philadelphia Commercial\r\nMuseum, transmitted by the Department of State to the various foreign\r\nGovernments, for an exchange of information and opinions with the\r\nview to the promotion of international trade. This invitation met\r\nwith general and cordial acceptance, and the Congress, which began\r\nits sessions at the exposition on the 13th of October, proved to be of\r\ngreat practical importance, from the fact that it developed a general\r\nrecognition of the interdependence of nations in trade and a most\r\ngratifying spirit of accommodation with reference to the gradual removal\r\nof existing impediments to reciprocal relations, without injury to the\r\nindustrial interests of either party.\r\n\r\nIn response to the invitation of His Majesty, the Emperor of Russia,\r\ndelegates from twenty-six countries were assembled at The Hague on the\r\n18th of May, as members of a conference in the interest of peace. The\r\ncommission from the United States consisted of the Hon. Andrew D. White,\r\nthe Hon. Seth Low, the Hon. Stanford Newel, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, of\r\nthe United States Navy, Captain William Crozier, of the United States\r\nArmy, and the Hon. Frederick W. Holls, secretary. The occasion seemed\r\nto be opportune for the serious consideration of a plan for the pacific\r\nadjustment of international differences, a subject in which the American\r\npeople have been deeply interested for many years, and a definite\r\nproject for a permanent international tribunal was included in the\r\ninstructions to the delegates of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe final act of the conference includes conventions upon the\r\namelioration of the laws and customs of war on land, the adaptation to\r\nmaritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1864, and\r\nthe extension of judicial methods to international cases. The Convention\r\nfor the Pacific Settlement of International Conflicts embodies the\r\nleading features of the American plan, with such modifications as were\r\nrendered necessary by the great diversity of views and interests\r\nrepresented by the delegates. The four titles of the convention provide\r\nfor the maintenance of general peace, the exercise of good offices and\r\nmediation, the formation of commissions of inquiry, and international\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nThe mediation provided for by the convention is purely voluntary and\r\nadvisory, and is intended to avoid any invasion or limitation of the\r\nsovereign rights of the adhering States. The commissions of inquiry\r\nproposed consists of delegations to be specifically constituted for\r\nparticular purposes by means of conventions between the contesting\r\nparties, having for their object the clear understanding of\r\ninternational differences before resorting to the use of force.\r\nThe provision for arbitration contemplates the formation of a permanent\r\ntribunal before which disputed cases may be brought for settlement\r\nby the mutual consent of the litigants in each separate case. The\r\nadvantages of such a permanent tribunal over impromptu commissions of\r\narbitration are conceived to be the actual existence of a competent\r\ncourt, prepared to administer justice, the greater economy resulting\r\nfrom a well-devised system, and the accumulated judicial skill and\r\nexperience which such a tribunal would soon possess.\r\n\r\nWhile earnestly promoting the idea of establishing a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal, the delegation of the United States was not\r\nunmindful of the inconveniences which might arise from an obtrusive\r\nexercise of mediation, and in signing the convention carefully guarded\r\nthe historic position of the United States by the following declaration:\r\n\r\n  Nothing contained in this convention shall be so construed as to require\r\n  the United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of\r\n  not intruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the\r\n  political questions or policy or internal administration of any foreign\r\n  state; nor shall anything contained in the said convention be construed\r\n  to imply a relinquishment by the United States of America of its\r\n  traditional attitude toward purely American questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus interpreted, the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of\r\nInternational Conflicts may be regarded as realizing the earnest desire\r\nof great numbers of American citizens, whose deep sense of justice,\r\nexpressed in numerous resolutions and memorials, has urged them to labor\r\nfor this noble achievement. The general character of this convention,\r\nalready signed by the delegates of more than twenty sovereign States,\r\nfurther commends it to the favorable action of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, whose ratification it still awaits.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message, and in obedience to the acts of the\r\nCongress of April 22 and 26, 1898, the remaining volunteer force\r\nenlisted for the Spanish War, consisting of 34,834 regulars and 110,202\r\nvolunteers, with over 5,000 volunteer officers, has been discharged from\r\nthe military service. Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831 men\r\nwere serving in the Philippines, and 1,650 of the regulars, who were\r\nentitled to be mustered out after the ratification of the treaty of\r\npeace. They voluntarily remained at the front until their places could\r\nbe filled by new troops. They were returned home in the order in which\r\nthey went to Manila, and are now all of them out of the service and in\r\nthe ranks of citizenship. I recommend that the Congress provide a\r\nspecial medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars, sailors, and\r\nmarines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained in the\r\nservice after their terms of enlistment had expired.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 2, 1899, Congress gave authority to increase the\r\nRegular Army to a maximum not exceeding 65,000 enlisted men, and to\r\nenlist a force of 35,000 volunteers, to be recruited from the country at\r\nlarge. By virtue of this authority the Regular Army has been increased\r\nto the number of 61,999 enlisted men and 2,248 officers, and new\r\nvolunteer regiments have been organized aggregating 33,050 enlisted men\r\nand 1,524 officers. Two of these volunteer regiments are made up of\r\ncolored men, with colored line officers. The new troops to take the\r\nplaces of those returning from the Philippines have been transported\r\nto Manila to the number of 581 officers and 26,322 enlisted men of\r\nthe Regular Army and 594 officers and 15,388 enlisted men of the new\r\nvolunteer force, while 504 officers and 14,119 men of the volunteer\r\nforce are on the ocean _en route_ to Manila.\r\n\r\nThe force now in Manila consists of 905 officers and 30,578 regulars,\r\nand 594 officers and 15,388 of the volunteers, making an aggregate of\r\n1,499 officers and 45,966 men. When the troops now under orders shall\r\nreach Manila the force in the archipelago will comprise 2,051 officers\r\nand 63,483 men. The muster out of the great volunteer army organized\r\nfor the Spanish War and the creation of a new army, the transportation\r\nfrom Manila to San Francisco of those entitled to discharge and the\r\ntransportation of the new troops to take their places have been a work\r\nof great magnitude well and ably done, for which too much credit cannot\r\nbe given the War Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year we have reduced our force in Cuba and Puerto Rico.\r\nIn Cuba we now have 334 officers and 10,796 enlisted men; in Puerto\r\nRico, 87 officers and 2,855 enlisted men and a battalion of 400 men\r\ncomposed of native Puerto Ricans; while stationed throughout the United\r\nStates are 910 officers and 17,317 men, and in Hawaii 12 officers and\r\n453 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Army are fully presented in the report of the\r\nSecretary of War. I cannot withhold from officers and men the highest\r\ncommendation for their soldierly conduct in trying situations, their\r\nwilling sacrifices for their country, and the integrity and ability with\r\nwhich they have performed unusual and difficult duties in our island\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the volunteer regiments authorized by the\r\nact of March 2, 1899, it was found that no provision had been made for\r\nchaplains. This omission was doubtless from inadvertence. I recommend\r\nthe early authorization for the appointment of one chaplain for each of\r\nsaid regiments. These regiments are now in the Philippines, and it is\r\nimportant that immediate action be had.\r\n\r\nIn restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule, and civic progress in\r\nCuba, Puerto Rico, and, so far as practicable, in the Philippines, the\r\nrehabilitation of the postal service has been an essential and important\r\npart of the work. It became necessary to provide mail facilities both\r\nfor our forces of occupation and for the native population. To meet this\r\nrequirement has involved a substantial reconstruction. The existing\r\nsystems were so fragmentary, defective, and inadequate that a new and\r\ncomprehensive organization had to be created. American trained officials\r\nhave been assigned to the directing and executive positions, while\r\nnatives have been chiefly employed in making up the body of the force.\r\nIn working out this plan the merit rule has been rigorously and\r\nfaithfully applied.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Director-General of Posts of Cuba was given\r\nto an expert who had been Chief Post-Office Inspector and Assistant\r\nPostmaster-General, and who united large experience with administrative\r\ncapacity. For the postmastership at Havana the range of skilled and\r\navailable men was scanned, and the choice fell upon one who had been\r\ntwenty years in the service as deputy postmaster and postmaster of a\r\nlarge city. This principle governed and determined the selection of the\r\nAmerican officials sent not only to Cuba, but to Puerto Rico and the\r\nPhilippines, and they were instructed to apply it so far as practicable\r\nin the employment of the natives as minor postmasters and clerks. The\r\npostal system in Cuba, though remaining under the general guidance of\r\nthe Postmaster-General, was made essentially independent. It was felt\r\nthat it should not be a burden upon the postal service of the United\r\nStates, and provision was made that any deficit in the postal revenue\r\nshould be a charge upon the general revenues of the island.\r\n\r\nThough Puerto Rico and the Philippines hold a different relation\r\nto the United States, yet, for convenience of administration, the\r\nsame principle of an autonomous system has been extended to them. The\r\ndevelopment of the service in all of the islands has been rapid and\r\nsuccessful. It has moved forward on American lines, with free delivery,\r\nmoney order, and registry systems, and has given the people mail\r\nfacilities far greater and more reliable than any they have ever before\r\nenjoyed. It is thus not only a vital agency of industrial, social, and\r\nbusiness progress, but an important influence in diffusing a just\r\nunderstanding of the true spirit and character of American\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe domestic postal service continues to grow with extraordinary\r\nrapidity. The expenditures and the revenues will each exceed\r\n$100,000,000 during the current year. Fortunately, since the revival\r\nof prosperous times the revenues have grown much faster than the\r\nexpenditures, and there is every indication that a short period will\r\nwitness the obliteration of the annual deficit. In this connection the\r\nreport of the Postmaster-General embodies a statement of some evils\r\nwhich have grown up outside of the contemplation of law in the treatment\r\nof some classes of mail matter which wrongly exercise the privilege\r\nof the pound rate, and shows that if this matter had been properly\r\nclassified and had paid the rate which it should have paid, instead\r\nof a postal deficit for the last fiscal year of $6,610,000, there\r\nwould have been on one basis a surplus of $17,637,570, and on another\r\nof $5,733,836. The reform thus suggested, in the opinion of the\r\nPostmaster-General, would not only put the postal service at once on a\r\nself-sustaining basis, but would permit great and valuable improvements,\r\nand I commend the subject to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has maintained the spirit and high efficiency which have always\r\ncharacterized that service, and has lost none of the gallantry in heroic\r\naction which has signalized its brilliant and glorious past. The Nation\r\nhas equal pride in its early and later achievements. Its habitual\r\nreadiness for every emergency has won the confidence and admiration of\r\nthe country. The people are interested in the continued preparation and\r\nprestige of the Navy and will justify liberal appropriations for its\r\nmaintenance and improvement. The officers have shown peculiar adaptation\r\nfor the performance of new and delicate duties which our recent war has\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that Congress will at once make necessary provision\r\nfor the armor plate for the vessels now under contract and building.\r\nIts attention is respectfully called to the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, in which the subject is fully presented. I unite in his\r\nrecommendation that the Congress enact such special legislation as may\r\nbe necessary to enable the Department to make contracts early in the\r\ncoming year for armor of the best quality that can be obtained in this\r\ncountry for the _Maine_, _Ohio_, and _Missouri_, and that the provision\r\nof the act of March 3, 1899, limiting the price of armor to $300 per ton\r\nbe removed.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of naval construction Italy and Japan, of the great\r\npowers, laid down less tonnage in the year 1899 than this country, and\r\nItaly alone has less tonnage under construction. I heartily concur in\r\nthe recommendations for the increase of the Navy, as suggested by the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nOur future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability to equal, if\r\nnot surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science,\r\nindustry, and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most\r\npowerful aids to the accomplishment of such a result. The attention of\r\nthe Congress is directed to the report of the Commissioner of Patents,\r\nin which will be found valuable suggestions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll of the United States\r\nnumbered 991,519. These include the pensioners of the Army and Navy in\r\nall our wars. The number added to the rolls during the year was 40,991.\r\nThe number dropped by reason of death, remarriage, minors by legal\r\nlimitation, failure to claim within three years, and other causes, was\r\n43,186, and the number of claims disallowed was 107,919. During the year\r\n89,054 pension certificates were issued, of which 37,077 were for new or\r\noriginal pensions. The amount disbursed for army and navy pensions\r\nduring the year was $138,355,052.95, which was $1,651,461.61 less than\r\nthe sum of the appropriations.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army of the Republic at its recent national encampment held in\r\nPhiladelphia has brought to my attention and to that of the Congress the\r\nwisdom and justice of a modification of the third section of the act of\r\nJune 27, 1890, which provides pensions for the widows of officers and\r\nenlisted men who served ninety days or more during the War of the\r\nRebellion and were honorably discharged, provided that such widows are\r\nwithout other means of support than their daily labor and were married\r\nto the soldier, sailor, or marine on account of whose service they claim\r\npension prior to the date of the act.\r\n\r\nThe present holding of the Department is that if the widow's income\r\naside from her daily labor does not exceed in amount what her pension\r\nwould be, to wit, $96 per annum, she would be deemed to be without\r\nother means of support than her daily labor, and would be entitled to\r\na pension under this act; while if the widow's income independent of\r\nthe amount received by her as the result of her daily labor exceeds\r\n$96, she would not be pensionable under the act. I am advised by the\r\nCommissioner of Pensions that the amount of the income allowed before\r\ntitle to pension would be barred has varied widely under different\r\nadministrations of the Pension Office, as well as during different\r\nperiods of the same administration, and has been the cause of just\r\ncomplaint and criticism.\r\n\r\nWith the approval of the Secretary of the Interior the Commissioner of\r\nPensions recommends that, in order to make the practice at all times\r\nuniform and to do justice to the dependent widow, the amount of income\r\nallowed independent of the proceeds of her daily labor should be not\r\nless than $250 per annum, and he urges that the Congress shall so amend\r\nthe act as to permit the Pension Office to grant pensionable status to\r\nwidows under the terms of the third section of the act of June 27, 1890,\r\nwhose income aside from the proceeds of daily labor is not in excess of\r\n$250 per annum. I believe this to be a simple act of justice and\r\nheartily recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe Dawes Commission reports that gratifying progress has been made in\r\nits work during the preceding year. The field-work of enrollment of four\r\nof the nations has been completed. I recommend that Congress at an early\r\nday make liberal appropriation for educational purposes in the Indian\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the act of Congress approved March 3, 1899, the\r\npreliminary work in connection with the Twelfth Census is now fully\r\nunder way. The officers required for the proper administration of the\r\nduties imposed have been selected. The provision for securing a proper\r\nenumeration of the population, as well as to secure evidence of the\r\nindustrial growth of the Nation, is broader and more comprehensive than\r\nany similar legislation in the past. The Director advises that every\r\nneedful effort is being made to push this great work to completion in\r\nthe time limited by the statute. It is believed that the Twelfth Census\r\nwill emphasize our remarkable advance in all that pertains to national\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of the act of Congress approved July 7, 1898,\r\nthe commission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nAttorney-General, and the Secretary of the Interior has made an\r\nagreement of settlement, which has had my approval, of the indebtedness\r\nto the Government growing out of the issue of bonds to aid in the\r\nconstruction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.\r\nThe agreement secures to the Government the principal and interest of\r\nsaid bonds, amounting to $58,812,715.48. There has been paid thereon\r\n$11,762,543.12, which has been covered into the Treasury, and the\r\nremainder, payable within ten years, with interest at the rate of 3 per\r\ncent per annum, payable semiannually, is secured by the deposit of an\r\nequal amount of first-mortgage bonds of the Pacific Railway companies.\r\nThe amounts paid and secured to be paid to the Government on account of\r\nthe Pacific Railroad subsidy claims are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Union Pacific, cash                          $58,448,223.75\r\n  Kansas Pacific, cash                           6,303,000.00\r\n  Central and Western Pacific, cash             11,798,314.14\r\n  Notes, secured                                47,050,172.36\r\n  Kansas Pacific--dividends for deficiency\r\n    due United States, cash                        821,897.70\r\n                                               --------------\r\n  Making a total of                            124,421,607.95\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole indebtedness was about $130,000,000, more than half of which\r\nconsisted of accrued interest, for which sum the Government has realized\r\nthe entire amount less about $6,000,000 within a period of two years.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1898, there were thirty forest reservations (exclusive of\r\nthe Afognak Forest and Fish Culture Reserve in Alaska), embracing an\r\nestimated area of 40,719,474 acres. During the past year two of the\r\nexisting forest reserves, the Trabuco Canyon (California) and Black\r\nHills (South Dakota and Wyoming), have been considerably enlarged, the\r\narea of the Mount Rainier Reserve, in the State of Washington, has been\r\nsomewhat reduced, and six additional reserves have been established,\r\nnamely, the San Francisco Mountains (Arizona), the Black Mesa (Arizona),\r\nLake Tahoe (California), Gallatin (Montana), Gila River (New Mexico),\r\nand Fish Lake (Utah), the total estimated area of which is 5,205,775\r\nacres. This makes at the present time a total of thirty-six forest\r\nreservations, embracing an estimated area of 46,021,899 acres. This\r\nestimated area is the aggregated areas within the boundaries of the\r\nreserves. The lands actually reserved are, however, only the vacant\r\npublic lands therein, and these have been set aside and reserved for\r\nsale or settlement in order that they may be of the greatest use to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nProtection of the national forests, inaugurated by the Department of\r\nthe Interior in 1897, has been continued during the past year and much\r\nhas been accomplished in the way of preventing forest fires and the\r\nprotection of the timber. There are now large tracts covered by forests\r\nwhich will eventually be reserved and set apart for forest uses. Until\r\nthat can be done Congress should increase the appropriations for the\r\nwork of protecting the forests.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is constantly consulting the needs of\r\nproducers in all the States and Territories. It is introducing seeds and\r\nplants of great value and promoting fuller diversification of crops.\r\nGrains, grasses, fruits, legumes, and vegetables are imported for all\r\nparts of the United States. Under this encouragement the sugar-beet\r\nfactory multiplies in the North and far West, semitropical plants are\r\nsent to the South, and congenial climates are sought for the choice\r\nproductions of the far East. The hybridizing of fruit trees and grains\r\nis conducted in the search for varieties adapted to exacting conditions.\r\nThe introduction of tea gardens into the Southern States promises to\r\nprovide employment for idle hands, as well as to supply the home market\r\nwith tea. The subject of irrigation where it is of vital importance to\r\nthe people is being carefully studied, steps are being taken to reclaim\r\ninjured or abandoned lands, and information for the people along these\r\nlines is being printed and distributed.\r\n\r\nMarkets are being sought and opened up for surplus farm and factory\r\nproducts in Europe and in Asia. The outlook for the education of the\r\nyoung farmer through agricultural college and experiment station, with\r\nopportunity given to specialize in the Department of Agriculture, is\r\nvery promising. The people of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine\r\nIslands should be helped, by the establishment of experiment stations,\r\nto a more scientific knowledge of the production of coffee, india\r\nrubber, and other tropical products, for which there is demand in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThere is widespread interest in the improvement of our public highways\r\nat the present time, and the Department of Agriculture is co-operating\r\nwith the people in each locality in making the best possible roads\r\nfrom local material and in experimenting with steel tracks. A more\r\nintelligent system of managing the forests of the country is being put\r\nin operation and a careful study of the whole forestry problem is being\r\nconducted throughout the United States. A very extensive and complete\r\nexhibit of the agricultural and horticultural products of the United\r\nStates is being prepared for the Paris Exposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, 1898, the treaty of peace between the United\r\nStates and Spain was signed. It provided, among other things, that Spain\r\nshould cede to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine\r\nIslands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of twenty\r\nmillions of dollars, and that the civil rights and political status of\r\nthe native inhabitants of the territories thus ceded to the United\r\nStates should be determined by the Congress. The treaty was ratified by\r\nthe Senate on the 6th of February, 1899, and by the Government of Spain\r\non the 19th of March following. The ratifications were exchanged on the\r\n11th of April and the treaty publicly proclaimed. On the 2d of March the\r\nCongress voted the sum contemplated by the treaty, and the amount was\r\npaid over to the Spanish Government on the 1st of May.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Philippines came to the United States. The islands\r\nwere ceded by the Government of Spain, which had been in undisputed\r\npossession of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely by our\r\nauthorized commissioners in Paris, under the direction of the Executive,\r\nbut by the constitutional and well-considered action of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of the United States in both Houses of\r\nCongress. I had every reason to believe, and I still believe that this\r\ntransfer of sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes and the\r\naspirations of the great mass of the Filipino people.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest moment no opportunity was lost of assuring the\r\npeople of the islands of our ardent desire for their welfare and of the\r\nintention of this Government to do everything possible to advance their\r\ninterests. In my order of the 19th of May, 1898, the commander of the\r\nmilitary expedition dispatched to the Philippines was instructed to\r\ndeclare that we came not to make war upon the people of that country,\r\n\"nor upon any party or faction among them, but to protect them in\r\ntheir homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious\r\nrights.\" That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority\r\nthere, on the 17th of August it was directed that \"there must be no\r\njoint occupation with the insurgents\"; that the United States must\r\npreserve the peace and protect persons and property within the territory\r\noccupied by their military and naval forces; that the insurgents and\r\nall others must recognize the military occupation and authority of\r\nthe United States. As early as December 4, before the cession, and\r\nin anticipation of that event, the commander in Manila was urged to\r\nrestore peace and tranquillity and to undertake the establishment of\r\na beneficent government, which should afford the fullest security for\r\nlife and property.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of\r\nthe forces of occupation was instructed \"to announce and proclaim in the\r\nmost public manner that we come, not as invaders and conquerors, but as\r\nfriends to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and\r\nin their personal and religious rights.\" On the same day, while ordering\r\nGeneral Otis to see that the peace should be preserved in Iloilo, he was\r\nadmonished that: \"It is most important that there should be no conflict\r\nwith the insurgents.\" On the 1st day of January, 1899, urgent orders\r\nwere reiterated that the kindly intentions of this Government should be\r\nin every possible way communicated to the insurgents.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January I announced my intention of dispatching to Manila\r\na commission composed of three gentlemen of the highest character and\r\ndistinction, thoroughly acquainted with the Orient, who, in association\r\nwith Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis, were instructed \"to\r\nfacilitate the most humane and effective extension of authority\r\nthroughout the islands, and to secure with the least possible delay the\r\nbenefits of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the\r\ninhabitants.\" These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman, president\r\nof Cornell University; the Hon. Charles Denby, for many years minister\r\nto China, and Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of the University of Michigan,\r\nwho had made a most careful study of life in the Philippines. While\r\nthe treaty of peace was under consideration in the Senate, these\r\nCommissioners set out on their mission of good will and liberation.\r\nTheir character was a sufficient guaranty of the beneficent purpose with\r\nwhich they went, even if they had not borne the positive instructions of\r\nthis Government, which made their errand pre-eminently one of peace and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nBut before their arrival at Manila the sinister ambition of a few\r\nleaders of the Filipinos had created a situation full of embarrassment\r\nfor us and most grievous in its consequences to themselves. The clear\r\nand impartial preliminary report of the Commissioners, which I transmit\r\nherewith, gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present\r\ninsurrectionary movement that the story need not be here repeated. It is\r\nenough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he was promised\r\nindependence by an officer of the United States in return for his\r\nassistance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by\r\nthe very witnesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent\r\nleader hoped for when he came back to Manila was the liberation of the\r\nislands from the Spanish control, which they had been laboring for years\r\nwithout success to throw off.\r\n\r\nThe prompt accomplishment of this work by the American Army and Navy\r\ngave him other ideas and ambitions, and insidious suggestions from\r\nvarious quarters perverted the purposes and intentions with which he had\r\ntaken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manila than the Filipino\r\nforces began to assume an attitude of suspicion and hostility which the\r\nutmost efforts of our officers and troops were unable to disarm or\r\nmodify. Their kindness and forbearance were taken as a proof of\r\ncowardice. The aggressions of the Filipinos continually increased until\r\nfinally, just before the time set by the Senate of the United States for\r\na vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently prepared in advance, was\r\nmade all along the American lines, which resulted in a terribly\r\ndestructive and sanguinary repulse of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nTen days later an order of the insurgent government was issued to its\r\nadherents who had remained in Manila, of which General Otis justly\r\nobserves that \"for barbarous intent it is unequaled in modern times.\"\r\nIt directs that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 15th of February the\r\n\"territorial militia\" shall come together in the streets of San Pedro\r\narmed with their _bolos_, with guns and ammunition where convenient;\r\nthat Filipino families only shall be respected; but that all other\r\nindividuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be exterminated without\r\nany compassion, after the extermination of the army of occupation,\r\nand adds: \"Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the Americans and\r\nexterminate them, that we may take our revenge for the infamies and\r\ntreacheries which they have committed upon us. Have no compassion upon\r\nthem; attack with vigor.\" A copy of this fell by good fortune into the\r\nhands of our officers and they were able to take measures to control the\r\nrising, which was actually attempted on the night of February 22, a week\r\nlater than was originally contemplated. Considerable numbers of armed\r\ninsurgents entered the city by waterways and swamps and in concert with\r\nconfederates inside attempted to destroy Manila by fire. They were kept\r\nin check during the night and the next day driven out of the city with\r\nheavy loss.\r\n\r\nThis was the unhappy condition of affairs which confronted our\r\nCommissioners on their arrival in Manila. They had come with the hope\r\nand intention of co-operating with Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis\r\nin establishing peace and order in the archipelago and the largest\r\nmeasure of self-government compatible with the true welfare of the\r\npeople. What they actually found can best be set forth in their own\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  Deplorable as war is, the one in which we are now engaged was\r\n  unavoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adventurous, and\r\n  enthusiastic army. No alternative was left to us except ignominious\r\n  retreat.\r\n\r\n  It is not to be conceived of that any American would have sanctioned\r\n  the surrender of Manila to the insurgents. Our obligations to other\r\n  nations and to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and our flag\r\n  demanded that force should be met by force. Whatever the future of\r\n  the Philippines may be, there is no course open to us now except the\r\n  prosecution of the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission.\r\n  The Commission is of the opinion that there has been no time since\r\n  the destruction of the Spanish squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was\r\n  possible to withdraw our forces from the island either with honor to\r\n  ourselves or with safety to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course thus clearly indicated has been unflinchingly pursued.\r\nThe rebellion must be put down. Civil government cannot be thoroughly\r\nestablished until order is restored. With a devotion and gallantry\r\nworthy of its most brilliant history, the Army, ably and loyally\r\nassisted by the Navy, has carried on this unwelcome but most righteous\r\ncampaign with richly deserved success. The noble self-sacrifice with\r\nwhich our soldiers and sailors whose terms of service had expired\r\nrefused to avail themselves of their right to return home as long as\r\nthey were needed at the front forms one of the brightest pages in our\r\nannals. Although their operations have been somewhat interrupted and\r\nchecked by a rainy season of unusual violence and duration, they have\r\ngained ground steadily in every direction, and now look forward\r\nconfidently to a speedy completion of their task.\r\n\r\nThe unfavorable circumstances connected with an active campaign have\r\nnot been permitted to interfere with the equally important work of\r\nreconstruction. Again I invite your attention to the report of the\r\nCommissioners for the interesting and encouraging details of the work\r\nalready accomplished in the establishment of peace and order and the\r\ninauguration of self-governing municipal life in many portions of the\r\narchipelago. A notable beginning has been made in the establishment\r\nof a government in the island of Negros which is deserving of special\r\nconsideration. This was the first island to accept American sovereignty.\r\nIts people unreservedly proclaimed allegiance to the United States\r\nand adopted a constitution looking to the establishment of a popular\r\ngovernment. It was impossible to guarantee to the people of Negros that\r\nthe constitution so adopted should be the ultimate form of government.\r\nSuch a question, under the treaty with Spain and in accordance with our\r\nown Constitution and laws, came exclusively within the jurisdiction\r\nof the Congress. The government actually set up by the inhabitants of\r\nNegros eventually proved unsatisfactory to the natives themselves. A new\r\nsystem was put into force by order of the Major-General Commanding the\r\nDepartment, of which the following are the most important elements:\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that the government of the island of Negros should\r\nconsist of a military governor appointed by the United States military\r\ngovernor of the Philippines, and a civil governor and an advisory\r\ncouncil elected by the people. The military governor was authorized\r\nto appoint secretaries of the treasury, interior, agriculture, public\r\ninstruction, an attorney-general, and an auditor. The seat of government\r\nwas fixed at Bacolod. The military governor exercises the supreme\r\nexecutive power. He is to see that the laws are executed, appoint to\r\noffice, and fill all vacancies in office not otherwise provided for,\r\nand may, with the approval of the military governor of the Philippines,\r\nremove any officer from office. The civil governor advises the military\r\ngovernor on all public civil questions and presides over the advisory\r\ncouncil. He, in general, performs the duties which are performed by\r\nsecretaries of state in our own system of government.\r\n\r\nThe advisory council consists of eight members elected by the people\r\nwithin territorial limits which are defined in the order of the\r\ncommanding general.\r\n\r\nThe times and places of holding elections are to be fixed by the\r\nmilitary governor of the island of Negros. The qualifications of voters\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) A voter must be a male citizen of the island of Negros. (2) Of the\r\nage of 21 years. (3) He shall be able to speak, read, and write the\r\nEnglish, Spanish, or Visayan language, or he must own real property\r\nworth $500, or pay a rental on real property of the value of $1,000. (4)\r\nHe must have resided in the island not less than one year preceding, and\r\nin the district in which he offers to register as a voter not less than\r\nthree months immediately preceding the time he offers to register. (5)\r\nHe must register at a time fixed by law before voting. (6) Prior to such\r\nregistration he shall have paid all taxes due by him to the Government.\r\nProvided, that no insane person shall be allowed to register or vote.\r\n\r\nThe military governor has the right to veto all bills or resolutions\r\nadopted by the advisory council, and his veto is final if not\r\ndisapproved by the military governor of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe advisory council discharges all the ordinary duties of a\r\nlegislature. The usual duties pertaining to said offices are to be\r\nperformed by the secretaries of the treasury, interior, agriculture,\r\npublic instruction, the attorney-general, and the auditor.\r\n\r\nThe judicial power is vested in three judges, who are to be appointed\r\nby the military governor of the island. Inferior courts are to be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nFree public schools are to be established throughout the populous\r\ndistricts of the island, in which the English language shall be taught,\r\nand this subject will receive the careful consideration of the advisory\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe burden of government must be distributed equally and equitably among\r\nthe people. The military authorities will collect and receive the\r\ncustoms revenue, and will control postal matters and Philippine\r\ninter-island trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe military governor, subject to the approval of the military governor\r\nof the Philippines, determines all questions not specifically provided\r\nfor and which do not come under the jurisdiction of the advisory\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the Sulu Islands have accepted the succession of\r\nthe United States to the rights of Spain, and our flag floats over\r\nthat territory. On the 10th of August, 1899, Brig.-Gen. J.C. Bates,\r\nUnited States Volunteers, negotiated an agreement with the Sultan\r\nand his principal chiefs, which I transmit herewith. By Article I the\r\nsovereignty of the United States over the whole archipelago of Jolo\r\nand its dependencies is declared and acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe United States flag will be used in the archipelago and its\r\ndependencies, on land and sea. Piracy is to be suppressed, and the\r\nSultan agrees to co-operate heartily with the United States authorities\r\nto that end and to make every possible effort to arrest and bring to\r\njustice all persons engaged in piracy. All trade in domestic products of\r\nthe archipelago of Jolo when carried on with any part of the Philippine\r\nIslands and under the American flag shall be free, unlimited, and\r\nundutiable. The United States will give full protection to the Sultan in\r\ncase any foreign nation should attempt to impose upon him. The United\r\nStates will not sell the island of Jolo or any other island of the Jolo\r\narchipelago to any foreign nation without the consent of the Sultan.\r\nSalaries for the Sultan and his associates in the administration of the\r\nislands have been agreed upon to the amount of $760 monthly.\r\n\r\nArticle X provides that any slave in the archipelago of Jolo shall have\r\nthe right to purchase freedom by paying to the master the usual market\r\nvalue. The agreement by General Bates was made subject to confirmation\r\nby the President and to future modifications by the consent of the\r\nparties in interest. I have confirmed said agreement, subject to the\r\naction of the Congress, and with the reservation, which I have directed\r\nshall be communicated to the Sultan of Jolo, that this agreement is not\r\nto be deemed in any way to authorize or give the consent of the United\r\nStates to the existence of slavery in the Sulu archipelago. I\r\ncommunicate these facts to the Congress for its information and action.\r\n\r\nEverything indicates that with the speedy suppression of the Tagalo\r\nrebellion life in the archipelago will soon resume its ordinary course\r\nunder the protection of our sovereignty, and the people of those favored\r\nislands will enjoy a prosperity and a freedom which they have never\r\nbefore known. Already hundreds of schools are open and filled with\r\nchildren. Religious freedom is sacredly assured and enjoyed. The courts\r\nare dispensing justice. Business is beginning to circulate in its\r\naccustomed channels. Manila, whose inhabitants were fleeing to the\r\ncountry a few months ago, is now a populous and thriving mart of\r\ncommerce. The earnest and unremitting endeavors of the Commission and\r\nthe Admiral and Major-General Commanding the Department of the Pacific\r\nto assure the people of the beneficent intentions of this Government\r\nhave had their legitimate effect in convincing the great mass of them\r\nthat peace and safety and prosperity and stable government can only be\r\nfound in a loyal acceptance of the authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe future government of the Philippines rests with the Congress of the\r\nUnited States. Few graver responsibilities have ever been confided to\r\nus. If we accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions,\r\na great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter\r\nof our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot\r\nbe abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and\r\nfinally to barbarism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among\r\nthe rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them\r\nunquestioned. Their rich plains and valleys would be the scene of\r\nendless strife and bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila Bay\r\ninstead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and\r\nprogress, will have been the beginning of an era of misery and violence\r\nworse than any which has darkened their unhappy past. The suggestion\r\nhas been made that we could renounce our authority over the islands\r\nand, giving them independence, could retain a protectorate over them.\r\nThis proposition will not be found, I am sure, worthy of your serious\r\nattention. Such an arrangement would involve at the outset a cruel\r\nbreach of faith. It would place the peaceable and loyal majority, who\r\nask nothing better than to accept our authority, at the mercy of the\r\nminority of armed insurgents. It would make us responsible for the acts\r\nof the insurgent leaders and give us no power to control them. It would\r\ncharge us with the task of protecting them against each other and\r\ndefending them against any foreign power with which they chose to\r\nquarrel. In short, it would take from the Congress of the United States\r\nthe power of declaring war and vest that tremendous prerogative in the\r\nTagal leader of the hour.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem desirable that I should recommend at this time a\r\nspecific and final form of government for these islands. When peace\r\nshall be restored it will be the duty of Congress to construct a plan\r\nof government which shall establish and maintain freedom and order and\r\npeace in the Philippines. The insurrection is still existing, and when\r\nit terminates further information will be required as to the actual\r\ncondition of affairs before inaugurating a permanent scheme of civil\r\ngovernment. The full report of the Commission, now in preparation, will\r\ncontain information and suggestions which will be of value to Congress,\r\nand which I will transmit as soon as it is completed. As long as the\r\ninsurrection continues the military arm must necessarily be supreme.\r\nBut there is no reason why steps should not be taken from time to time\r\nto inaugurate governments essentially popular in their form as fast\r\nas territory is held and controlled by our troops. To this end I am\r\nconsidering the advisability of the return of the Commission, or such of\r\nthe members thereof as can be secured, to aid the existing authorities\r\nand facilitate this work throughout the islands. I have believed that\r\nreconstruction should not begin by the establishment of one central\r\ncivil government for all the islands, with its seat at Manila, but\r\nrather that the work should be commenced by building up from the bottom,\r\nfirst establishing municipal governments and then provincial\r\ngovernments, a central government at last to follow.\r\n\r\nUntil Congress shall have made known the formal expression of its\r\nwill I shall use the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\r\nstatutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant\r\nislands as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats. I shall\r\nput at the disposal of the Army and Navy all the means which the\r\nliberality of Congress and the people have provided to cause this\r\nunprovoked and wasteful insurrection to cease.\r\n\r\nIf any orders of mine were required to insure the merciful conduct of\r\nmilitary and naval operations, they would not be lacking; but every step\r\nof the progress of our troops has been marked by a humanity which has\r\nsurprised even the misguided insurgents. The truest kindness to them\r\nwill be a swift and effective defeat of their present leader. The hour\r\nof victory will be the hour of clemency and reconstruction.\r\n\r\nNo effort will be spared to build up the waste places desolated by war\r\nand by long years of misgovernment. We shall not wait for the end of\r\nstrife to begin the beneficent work. We shall continue, as we have\r\nbegun, to open the schools and the churches, to set the courts in\r\noperation, to foster industry and trade and agriculture, and in every\r\nway in our power to make these people whom Providence has brought within\r\nour jurisdiction feel that it is their liberty and not our power, their\r\nwelfare and not our gain, we are seeking to enhance. Our flag has never\r\nwaved over any community but in blessing. I believe the Filipinos will\r\nsoon recognize the fact that it has not lost its gift of benediction in\r\nits world-wide journey to their shores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment in administration has occurred by reason of the\r\npeculiar status which the Hawaiian Islands at present occupy under the\r\njoint resolution of annexation approved July 7, 1898. While by that\r\nresolution the Republic of Hawaii as an independent nation was\r\nextinguished, its separate sovereignty destroyed, and its property and\r\npossessions vested in the United States, yet a complete establishment\r\nfor its government under our system was not effected. While the\r\nmunicipal laws of the islands not enacted for the fulfillment of\r\ntreaties and not inconsistent with the joint resolution or contrary to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States or any of its treaties remain in\r\nforce, yet these laws relate only to the social and internal affairs of\r\nthe islands, and do not touch many subjects of importance which are\r\nof a broader national character. For example, the Hawaiian Republic\r\nwas divested of all title to the public lands in the islands, and is\r\nnot only unable to dispose of lands to settlers desiring to take up\r\nhomestead sites, but is without power to give complete title in cases\r\nwhere lands have been entered upon under lease or other conditions which\r\ncarry with them the right to the purchaser, lessee, or settler to have a\r\nfull title granted to him upon compliance with the conditions prescribed\r\nby law or by his particular agreement of entry.\r\n\r\nQuestions of doubt and difficulty have also arisen with reference to\r\nthe collection of tonnage tax on vessels coming from Hawaiian ports;\r\nwith reference to the status of Chinese in the islands, their entrance\r\nand exit therefrom; as to patents and copyrights; as to the register\r\nof vessels under the navigation laws; as to the necessity of holding\r\nelections in accordance with the provisions of the Hawaiian statutes\r\nfor the choice of various officers, and as to several other matters of\r\ndetail touching the interests both of the island and of the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBy the resolution of annexation the President was directed to appoint\r\nfive commissioners to recommend to Congress such legislation concerning\r\nthe islands as they should deem necessary or proper. These commissioners\r\nwere duly appointed and after a careful investigation and study of the\r\nsystem of laws and government prevailing in the islands, and of the\r\nconditions existing there, they prepared a bill to provide a government\r\nunder the title of \"The Territory of Hawaii.\" The report of the\r\nCommission, with the bill which they prepared, was transmitted by me to\r\nCongress on December 6, 1898, but the bill still awaits final action.\r\n\r\nThe people of these islands are entitled to the benefits and privileges\r\nof our Constitution, but in the absence of any act of Congress providing\r\nfor Federal courts in the islands, and for a procedure by which appeals,\r\nwrits of error, and other judicial proceedings necessary for the\r\nenforcement of civil rights may be prosecuted, they are powerless to\r\nsecure their enforcement by the judgment of the courts of the United\r\nStates. It is manifestly important, therefore, that an act shall be\r\npassed as speedily as possible erecting these islands into a judicial\r\ndistrict, providing for the appointment of a judge and other proper\r\nofficers and methods of procedure in appellate proceedings, and that the\r\ngovernment of this newly acquired territory under the Federal\r\nConstitution shall be fully defined and provided for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA necessity for immediate legislative relief exists in the Territory of\r\nAlaska. Substantially the only law providing a civil government for this\r\nTerritory is the act of May 17, 1884. This is meager in its provisions,\r\nand is fitted only for the administration of affairs in a country\r\nsparsely inhabited by civilized people and unimportant in trade and\r\nproduction, as was Alaska at the time this act was passed. The increase\r\nin population by immigration during the past few years, consequent\r\nupon the discovery of gold, has produced such a condition as calls\r\nfor more ample facilities for local self-government and more numerous\r\nconveniences of civil and judicial administration. Settlements have\r\ngrown up in various places, constituting in point of population and\r\nbusiness cities of thousands of inhabitants, yet there is no provision\r\nof law under which a municipality can be organized or maintained.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the inhabitants have met together and voluntarily\r\nformed a municipal organization for the purposes of local government,\r\nadopting the form of a municipal constitution and charter, under\r\nwhich said officials have been appointed; and ordinances creating and\r\nregulating a police force, a fire department, a department of health,\r\nand making provision for the care of the insane and indigent poor and\r\nsick and for public schools, have been passed. These proceedings and\r\nthe ordinances passed by such municipalities are without statutory\r\nauthority and have no sanction, except as they are maintained by the\r\npopular sentiment of the community. There is an entire absence of\r\nauthority to provide the ordinary instruments of local police control\r\nand administration, the population consisting of the usual percentage\r\nof lawless adventurers of the class that always flock to new fields of\r\nenterprise or discovery, and under circumstances which require more than\r\nordinary provision for the maintenance of peace, good order, and lawful\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe whole vast area of Alaska comprises but one judicial district, with\r\none judge, one marshal, and one district attorney, yet the civil and\r\ncriminal business has more than doubled within the past year, and is\r\nmany times greater both in volume and importance than it was in 1884.\r\nThe duties of the judge require him to travel thousands of miles to\r\ndischarge his judicial duties at the various places designated for that\r\npurpose. The Territory should be divided into at least two districts,\r\nand an additional judge, district attorney, marshal, and other\r\nappropriate officers be provided.\r\n\r\nThere is practically no organized form of government in the Territory.\r\nThere is no authority, except in Congress, to pass any law, no matter\r\nhow local or trivial, and the difficulty of conveying to the Congress an\r\nadequate conception and understanding of the various needs of the people\r\nin the different communities is easily understood. I see no reason why a\r\nmore complete form of Territorial organization should not be provided.\r\nFollowing the precedent established in the year 1805, when a temporary\r\ngovernment was provided for the recently acquired territory, then\r\nknown under the name of Louisiana, it seems to me that it would be\r\nadvantageous to confer greater executive power upon the governor and\r\nto establish, as was done in the case of the Territory of Louisiana, a\r\nlegislative council having power to adopt ordinances which shall extend\r\nto all the rightful subjects of local legislation, such ordinances not\r\nto take effect until reported to and approved by the Congress if in\r\nsession, and if that body is not in session then by the President.\r\nIn this manner a system of laws providing for the incorporation and\r\ngovernment of towns and cities having a certain population, giving them\r\nthe power to establish and maintain a system of education to be locally\r\nsupported, and ordinances providing for police, sanitary, and other such\r\npurposes, could be speedily provided. I believe a provision of this kind\r\nwould be satisfactory to the people of the Territory. It is probable\r\nthat the area is too vast and the population too scattered and\r\ntransitory to make it wise at the present time to provide for an\r\nelective legislative body, but the conditions calling for local\r\nself-government will undoubtedly very soon exist, and will be\r\nfacilitated by the measures which I have recommended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI recommend that legislation to the same end be had with reference to\r\nthe government of Puerto Rico. The time is ripe for the adoption of a\r\ntemporary form of government for this island; and many suggestions made\r\nwith reference to Alaska are applicable also to Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe system of civil jurisprudence now adopted by the people of this\r\nisland is described by competent lawyers who are familiar with it, as\r\nthoroughly modern and scientific, so far as it relates to matters of\r\ninternal business, trade, production, and social and private right in\r\ngeneral. The cities of the island are governed under charters which\r\nprobably require very little or no change. So that with relation to\r\nmatters of local concern and private right, it is not probable that\r\nmuch, if any, legislation is desirable; but with reference to public\r\nadministration and the relations of the island to the Federal\r\nGovernment, there are many matters which are of pressing urgency.\r\nThe same necessity exists for legislation on the part of Congress to\r\nestablish Federal courts and Federal jurisdiction in the island as has\r\nbeen previously pointed out by me with reference to Hawaii. Besides the\r\nadministration of justice, there are the subjects of the public lands;\r\nthe control and improvement of rivers and harbors; the control of the\r\nwaters or streams not navigable, which, under the Spanish law, belonged\r\nto the Crown of Spain, and have by the treaty of cession passed to the\r\nUnited States; the immigration of people from foreign countries; the\r\nimportation of contract labor; the imposition and collection of internal\r\nrevenue; the application of the navigation laws; the regulation of the\r\ncurrent money; the establishment of post-offices and post-roads; the\r\nregulation of tariff rates on merchandise imported from the island into\r\nthe United States; the establishment of ports of entry and delivery; the\r\nregulation of patents and copyrights; these, with various other subjects\r\nwhich rest entirely within the power of the Congress, call for careful\r\nconsideration and immediate action.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that since the cession Puerto Rico has been\r\ndenied the principal markets she had long enjoyed and our tariffs have\r\nbeen continued against her products as when she was under Spanish\r\nsovereignty. The markets of Spain are closed to her products except upon\r\nterms to which the commerce of all nations is subjected. The island of\r\nCuba, which used to buy her cattle and tobacco without customs duties,\r\nnow imposes the same duties upon these products as from any other\r\ncountry entering her ports. She has therefore lost her free intercourse\r\nwith Spain and Cuba without any compensating benefits in this market.\r\nHer coffee was little known and not in use by our people, and therefore\r\nthere was no demand here for this, one of her chief products. The\r\nmarkets of the United States should be opened up to her products. Our\r\nplain duty is to abolish all customs tariffs between the United States\r\nand Puerto Rico and give her products free access to our markets.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the hurricane which swept over Puerto Rico on the 8th of\r\nAugust, 1899, over 100,000 people were reduced to absolute destitution,\r\nwithout homes, and deprived of the necessaries of life. To the appeal\r\nof the War Department the people of the United States made prompt and\r\ngenerous response. In addition to the private charity of our people,\r\nthe War Department has expended for the relief of the distressed\r\n$392,342.63, which does not include the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the government of the island under the law of\r\nbelligerent right, now maintained through the Executive Department,\r\nshould be superseded by an administration entirely civil in its nature.\r\nFor present purposes I recommend that Congress pass a law for the\r\norganization of a temporary government, which shall provide for the\r\nappointment by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate, of\r\na governor and such other officers as the general administration of the\r\nisland may require, and that for legislative purposes upon subjects of a\r\nlocal nature not partaking of a Federal character a legislative council,\r\ncomposed partly of Puerto Ricans and partly of citizens of the United\r\nStates, shall be nominated and appointed by the President, subject to\r\nconfirmation by the Senate, their acts to be subject to the approval\r\nof the Congress or the President prior to going into effect. In the\r\nmunicipalities and other local subdivisions I recommend that the\r\nprinciple of local self-government be applied at once, so as to enable\r\nthe intelligent citizens of the island to participate in their own\r\ngovernment and to learn by practical experience the duties and\r\nrequirements of a self-contained and self-governing people. I have\r\nnot thought it wise to commit the entire government of the island to\r\nofficers selected by the people, because I doubt whether in habits,\r\ntraining, and experience they are such as to fit them to exercise at\r\nonce so large a degree of self-government; but it is my judgment and\r\nexpectation that they will soon arrive at an attainment of experience\r\nand wisdom and self-control that will justify conferring upon them a\r\nmuch larger participation in the choice of their insular officers.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental requirement for these people, as for all people, is\r\neducation. The free schoolhouse is the best preceptor for citizenship.\r\nIn the introduction of modern educational methods care, however, must\r\nbe exercised that changes be not made too abruptly and that the history\r\nand racial peculiarities of the inhabitants shall be given due weight.\r\nSystems of education in these new possessions founded upon common-sense\r\nmethods, adapted to existing conditions and looking to the future moral\r\nand industrial advancement of the people, will commend to them in a\r\npeculiarly effective manner the blessings of free government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe love of law and the sense of obedience and submission to the\r\nlawfully constituted judicial tribunals are embedded in the hearts of\r\nour people, and any violation of these sentiments and disregard of their\r\nobligations justly arouses public condemnation. The guaranties of life,\r\nliberty, and of civil rights should be faithfully upheld; the right of\r\ntrial by jury respected and defended. The rule of the courts should\r\nassure the public of the prompt trial of those charged with criminal\r\noffenses, and upon conviction the punishment should be commensurate with\r\nthe enormity of the crime.\r\n\r\nThose who, in disregard of law and the public peace, unwilling to await\r\nthe judgment of court and jury, constitute themselves judges and\r\nexecutioners should not escape the severest penalties for their crimes.\r\n\r\nWhat I said in my inaugural address of March 4, 1897, I now repeat:\r\n\r\n  The constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld.\r\n  Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like\r\n  the United States. Courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties of the\r\n  laws. The preservation of public order, the right of discussion, the\r\n  integrity of courts, and the orderly administration of justice must\r\n  continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Government securely\r\n  rests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the act of Congress providing for an appropriate\r\nnational celebration in the year 1900 of the establishment of the seat\r\nof Government in the District of Columbia, I have appointed a committee,\r\nconsisting of the governors of all the States and Territories of the\r\nUnited States, who have been invited to assemble in the city of\r\nWashington on the 21st of December, 1899, which, with the committees of\r\nthe Congress and the District of Columbia, are charged with the proper\r\nconduct of this celebration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session appropriated five thousand dollars \"to\r\nenable the Chief of Engineers of the Army to continue the examination of\r\nthe subject and to make or secure designs, calculations, and estimates\r\nfor a memorial bridge from the most convenient point of the Naval\r\nObservatory grounds, or adjacent thereto, across the Potomac River\r\nto the most convenient point of the Arlington estate property.\" In\r\naccordance with the provisions of this act, the Chief of Engineers has\r\nselected four eminent bridge engineers to submit competitive designs\r\nfor a bridge combining the elements of strength and durability and such\r\narchitectural embellishment and ornamentation as will fitly apply to\r\nthe dedication, \"A memorial to American patriotism.\" The designs are\r\nnow being prepared, and as soon as completed will be submitted to\r\nthe Congress by the Secretary of War. The proposed bridge would be a\r\nconvenience to all the people from every part of the country who visit\r\nthe national cemetery, an ornament to the Capital of the Nation, and\r\nforever stand as a monument to American patriotism. I do not doubt that\r\nCongress will give to the enterprise still further proof of its favor\r\nand approval.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe executive order of May 6, 1896, extending the limits of the\r\nclassified service, brought within the operation of the civil-service\r\nlaw and rules nearly all of the executive civil service not previously\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\nSome of the inclusions were found wholly illogical and unsuited\r\nto the work of the several Departments. The application of the rules\r\nto many of the places so included was found to result in friction and\r\nembarrassment. After long and very careful consideration, it became\r\nevident to the heads of the Departments, responsible for their\r\nefficiency, that in order to remove these difficulties and promote\r\nan efficient and harmonious administration certain amendments were\r\nnecessary. These amendments were promulgated by me in executive order\r\ndated May 29, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe principal purpose of the order was to except from competitive\r\nexamination certain places involving fiduciary responsibilities or\r\nduties of a strictly confidential, scientific, or executive character\r\nwhich it was thought might better be filled either by noncompetitive\r\nexamination, or in the discretion of the appointing officer, than by\r\nopen competition. These places were comparatively few in number. The\r\norder provides for the filling of a much larger number of places, mainly\r\nin the outside service of the War Department, by what is known as the\r\nregistration system, under regulations to be approved by the President,\r\nsimilar to those which have produced such admirable results in the\r\nnavy-yard service.\r\n\r\nAll of the amendments had for their main object a more efficient and\r\nsatisfactory administration of the system of appointments established\r\nby the civil-service law. The results attained show that under their\r\noperation the public service has improved and that the civil-service\r\nsystem is relieved of many objectionable features which heretofore\r\nsubjected it to just criticism and the administrative officers to the\r\ncharge of unbusinesslike methods in the conduct of public affairs. It\r\nis believed that the merit system has been greatly strengthened and its\r\npermanence assured. It will be my constant aim in the administration of\r\ngovernment in our new possessions to make fitness, character, and merit\r\nessential to appointment to office, and to give to the capable and\r\ndeserving inhabitants preference in appointments.\r\n\r\nThe 14th of December will be the One Hundredth Anniversary of the death\r\nof Washington. For a hundred years the Republic has had the priceless\r\nadvantage of the lofty standard of character and conduct which he\r\nbequeathed to the American people. It is an inheritance which time,\r\ninstead of wasting, continually increases and enriches. We may justly\r\nhope that in the years to come the benignant influence of the Father of\r\nhis Country may be even more potent for good than in the century which\r\nis drawing to a close. I have been glad to learn that in many parts of\r\nthe country the people will fittingly observe this historic anniversary.\r\n\r\nPresented to this Congress are great opportunities. With them come great\r\nresponsibilities. The power confided to us increases the weight of our\r\nobligations to the people, and we must be profoundly sensible of them\r\nas we contemplate the new and grave problems which confront us. Aiming\r\nonly at the public good, we cannot err. A right interpretation of the\r\npeople's will and of duty cannot fail to insure wise measures for the\r\nwelfare of the islands which have come under the authority of the United\r\nStates, and inure to the common interest and lasting honor of our\r\ncountry. Never has this Nation had more abundant cause than during the\r\npast year for thankfulness to God for manifold blessings and mercies,\r\nfor which we make reverent acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 11, 1899_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Congress, a\r\ncommunication from the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of the State\r\nof New York, inclosing resolutions unanimously adopted by that chamber\r\non June 1, 1899, requesting legislation authorizing the appointment of\r\ncommercial _attachés_ to the principal embassies and legations of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 4, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of December 20, 1899, I\r\ntransmit herewith a copy of the report of the commission appointed by\r\nthe President to investigate the conduct of the War Department in the\r\nwar with Spain, together with a copy of all the testimony taken by said\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 1, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of January 24, 1900, I\r\ntransmit herewith a copy of the report and all accompanying papers of\r\nBrig-Gen.

Peck,\r\nCommissioner-General of the United States to the Paris Exposition of\r\n1900, dated November 17, 1899, submitting a detailed statement of the\r\nexpenditures incurred under authority of law.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 17, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in response\r\nto the resolution of the House of Representatives of March 23, 1900,\r\ncalling for copies of any and all letters on file in the Department of\r\nState from citizens of the United States resident in the South African\r\nRepublic from January 1, 1899, to the present time, making complaints\r\nof treatment by the South African Republic.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 3, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return, without approval, House bill No. 4001, entitled \"An\r\nact authorizing the rights of settlers on the Navajo Indian Reservation,\r\nTerritory of Arizona.\" My objections to the bill are embodied in the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\nThis tribe has a population of about 20,500 souls, of whom 1,000 dress\r\nin the manner of white men, 250 can read, and 500 use enough English\r\nfor ordinary conversation. Last year they cultivated 8,000 acres, and\r\npossessed approximately 1,000,000 sheep, 250,000 goats, 100,500 cattle,\r\n1,200 swine, and very considerable herds of horses and ponies.\r\n\r\nPrior to January last the reservation, which is in the extreme\r\nnortheastern portion of the Territory of Arizona, consisted of lands\r\nset apart for the use of these Indians under the treaty of June 1, 1863\r\n(15 Stat., 667), and subsequent executive orders. On account of the\r\nconditions naturally prevailing in that section, the reservation, as\r\nthen constituted, was altogether inadequate for the purpose for which\r\nit was set apart. There was not a sufficient supply of grass or water\r\nwithin its borders for the flocks and herds of the tribe, and in\r\nconsequence more than one-third of the Indians were habitually off the\r\nreservation with their flocks and herds, and were in frequent contention\r\nand strife with whites over pasturage and water.\r\n\r\nAfter most careful inquiry and inspection of the reservation as it\r\nthen existed, and of adjacent land by efficient officers in the Indian\r\nservice, the Commission of Indian Affairs, with the concurrence of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, recommended that the limits of the\r\nreservation be extended westward so as to embrace the lands lying\r\nbetween the Navajo and Moqui Indian reservations on the east and the\r\nColorado and Little Colorado Rivers and the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve\r\non the west. This recommendation was supported by a very numerously\r\nsigned petition from the white residents of that section, and also by a\r\nletter from the Governor of the Territory of Arizona, in which it was\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  I understand that a petition has been forwarded asking that the western\r\n  limit be fixed at the Little Colorado River, as being better for all\r\n  concerned and less liable to cause friction between the Indians and the\r\n  whites. I earnestly hope that the prayer of the petitioners be granted,\r\n  for the reason that the Little Colorado could be made a natural dividing\r\n  line, distinct and well defined, and would extend the grazing territory\r\n  of the Navajoes to a very considerable extent without seriously\r\n  encroaching upon the interests of white settlers who have their property\r\n  in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n  I think great care should be exercised in questions of this nature\r\n  because of possible serious friction which may occur if the interests of\r\n  all concerned are not carefully protected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigation which preceded this recommendation, and upon which it\r\nwas in part based, showed that with the boundaries of the reservation\r\nthus extended the Indians would be able to obtain within the limits of\r\nthe reservation sufficient grass and water for their flocks and herds,\r\nand the Government would therefore be justified in confining them to the\r\nreservation, thus avoiding the prior contention and friction between\r\nthem and the whites.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that but little aid had been extended to these Indians by\r\nthe Government for many years, that they had taken on habits of industry\r\nand husbandry, which entitled them to encouragement, and that it was\r\nneither just nor possible to confine them to the limits of a reservation\r\nwhich would not sustain their flocks and herds, an order was issued by\r\nme January 8 last, extending the reservation boundaries as recommended.\r\nThe Indians have accepted this as an evidence of the good faith of the\r\nGovernment toward them, and it is now the belief of those charged with\r\nthe administration of Indian affairs that further contention and\r\nfriction between the Indians and whites will be avoided, if this\r\narrangement is not disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe present bill proposes to open to miners and prospectors, and to the\r\noperation of the mining laws, a substantial portion of this reservation,\r\nincluding a part of the lands covered by the recent order. There has\r\nbeen no effort to obtain from the Indians a concession of this\r\ncharacter, nor has any reason been presented why, if these lands are to\r\nbe taken from them--for that will practically result from this bill, if\r\nit becomes a law, even though not so intended--it should not be done in\r\npursuance of negotiations had with the Indians as in other instances.\r\n\r\nThe Indians could not understand how lands given to them in January as\r\nnecessary for their use should be taken away without previous notice in\r\nMay of the same year. While the Indians are the wards of the Government,\r\nand must submit to that which is deemed for their best interests by the\r\nsovereign guardian, they should, nevertheless, be dealt with in a manner\r\ncalculated to give them confidence in the Government and to assist them\r\nin passing through the inevitable transition to a state of civilization\r\nand full citizenship. Believing that due consideration has not been\r\ngiven to the status and interests of the Indians, I withhold my approval\r\nfrom the bill.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 12, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate, dated March 2, 1900, I send\r\nherewith copy of an order to the provost marshal general of Manila,\r\ndated March 8, 1900, and the various endorsements and reports thereon,\r\nwhereby it appears that the traffic in wine, beer, and liquor in the\r\ncity of Manila is now controlled under a rigidly enforced high-license\r\nsystem; that the number of places where the liquor is sold has greatly\r\ndecreased; that all such places are required to be closed at 8:30 in the\r\nevening on week days and to be kept closed on Sundays, and that the\r\norderly condition of the city compares favorably with cities of similar\r\nsize in the United States.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 12, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to a resolution of the Senate of April 11, 1900, reading as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be, and is hereby, requested, if not\r\n  incompatible with public interest, to inform the Senate whether persons\r\n  have been executed in Puerto Rico by the Spanish method of garrote since\r\n  he has been governing that country as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and\r\n  Navy of the United States; and if so, the President is requested to\r\n  inform the Senate why this mode of execution was adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith copies of reports from Brig.-Gen. George W. Davis,\r\nUnited States Volunteers, military governor of Puerto Rico, which\r\ncontain the information called for.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 19, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the following resolution of the Senate of April 28, 1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be, and he is hereby requested, if\r\n  not incompatible with the public interest, to inform the Senate whether\r\n  General Torres, one of the officers of the Philippine army, came to\r\n  General Otis with a flag of truce on February 5, 1899, the day after\r\n  the fighting commenced between our forces and those of the Filipinos,\r\n  and stated to General Otis that General Aguinaldo declared that\r\n  fighting had been begun accidentally, and was not authorized by him,\r\n  and that Aguinaldo wished to have it stopped, and that to bring about\r\n  a conclusion of hostilities he proposed the establishment of a neutral\r\n  zone between the two armies of a width that would be agreeable to\r\n  General Otis, so that during the peace negotiations there might be no\r\n  further danger of conflict between the two armies, and whether General\r\n  Otis replied that fighting having once begun, must go on to the grim\r\n  end. Was General Otis directed by the Secretary of War to make such an\r\n  answer? Did General Otis telegraph the Secretary of War on February 9,\r\n  1899, as follows: \"Aguinaldo now applies for a cessation of hostilities\r\n  and conference. Have declined to answer?\" And did General Otis\r\n  afterwards reply? Was he directed by the Secretary of War to reply, and\r\n  what answer, if any, did he or the Secretary of War make to the\r\n  application to cease fighting?\r\n\r\n  The President is also requested to inform the Senate whether the flag of\r\n  the Philippine Republic was ever saluted by Admiral Dewey or any of the\r\n  vessels of his fleet at any time since May 1, 1898. \"Did Admiral Dewey,\r\n  at the request of Aguinaldo, or any officer under him, send the vessels\r\n  _Concord_ and _Raleigh_ to Subig Bay to assist Aguinaldo's\r\n  forces in the capture of the Spanish garrison at that place? Did said\r\n  vessels assist in the capture of the Spanish garrison, and after the\r\n  capture did they turn the prisoners thus taken over to the Philippine\r\n  forces?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a copy of a cable dispatch to General Otis, dated\r\nApril 30, 1900, and of his reply, dated May 1, 1900.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis was not directed by the Secretary of War to make such\r\nan answer as is set forth in the resolution, nor were any answers\r\nto communications upon the subject of the cessation of hostilities\r\nprescribed by the Secretary of War to General Otis, but he was left to\r\nexercise in respect thereof his own judgment, based upon his superior\r\nknowledge of the conditions surrounding the troops under his command.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a copy of a cable dispatch from General Otis, sent from\r\nManila February 8, 1899, received in Washington February 9, 1899, being\r\nthe same dispatch to which he refers in his reply of May 1, 1900 as\r\nmisleading. So far as I am informed, General Otis did not afterwards\r\nreply, except as set forth in his dispatch of May 1, 1900. He was not\r\ndirected by the Secretary of War to reply, and no answer was made by him\r\nor the Secretary of War to an application to cease fighting. There\r\nappears to have been no such application.\r\n\r\nI further transmit a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Navy to\r\nAdmiral George Dewey, dated May 14, 1900, and a copy of the Admiral's\r\nreply, dated May 17, 1900.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 22, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, relative to the status of Chinese persons in the\r\nPhilippine Islands.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 22, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a communication\r\nfrom the Secretary of Agriculture, forwarding a report on the progress\r\nof the beet-sugar industry in the United States during the year 1899. It\r\nembraces the observations made by a special agent on the various phases\r\nof the beet-sugar industry of the Hawaiian Islands; also the results of\r\nanalyses of sugar-beets received by the Department of Agriculture from\r\nthe different States and Territories, together with much other\r\ninformation relating to the sugar industry.\r\n\r\nYour attention is invited to the recommendation of the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture that 20,000 copies of the report be printed for the use of\r\nthe Department, in addition to such number as may be desired for the use\r\nof the Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 26, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of May\r\n22, 1900, a report from the Secretary of State showing that the consul\r\nof the United States at Pretoria was directed on May 8, 1900, to forward\r\ncopies of the constitutions of the South African Republic and the Orange\r\nFree State by return mail. Translations thereof will be communicated to\r\nthe Senate at the earliest practicable date.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, June 2, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in further reply to the resolution of the Senate of\r\nApril 10, 1900, having reference to Senate Document No. 336, Fifty-sixth\r\nCongress, first session, a further report from the Secretary of State,\r\nshowing the places of residence of experts, clerks, officers, and\r\nemployees of the Commission of the United States to the Paris Exposition\r\nof 1900, as well as the items of expenditures of the Commission for the\r\nmonths of January, February, and March, 1900, amounting to $211,583.25.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, June 6, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn further response to the resolution of the Senate of January 17, 1900,\r\nrequesting, among other things, information tending to throw light upon\r\nthe conduct and events of the insurrection against the authority of the\r\nUnited States in the Philippine Islands, I transmit herewith a\r\ncorrespondence between the Secretary of War and the officers of the\r\nSecond Division of the Eighth Army Corps.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 3, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the outgoing of the old and the incoming of the new century you begin\r\nthe last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress with evidences on every\r\nhand of individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing\r\nstrength and increasing power for good of Republican institutions. Your\r\ncountrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is\r\nmore firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the\r\ndetermination to preserve it are more universal than at any former\r\nperiod of our history.\r\n\r\nThe Republic was never so strong, because never so strongly intrenched\r\nin the hearts of the people as now. The Constitution, with few\r\namendments, exists as it left the hands of its authors. The additions\r\nwhich have been made to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended\r\ncitizenship. Popular government has demonstrated in its one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four years of trial here its stability and security, and its\r\nefficiency as the best instrument of national development and the best\r\nsafeguard to human rights.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sixth Congress assembled in November, 1800, the population\r\nof the United States was 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. Then we had\r\nsixteen States. Now we have forty-five. Then our territory consisted\r\nof 909,050 square miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles. Education,\r\nreligion, and morality have kept pace with our advancement in other\r\ndirections, and while extending its power the Government has adhered to\r\nits foundation principles and abated none of them in dealing with our\r\nnew peoples and possessions. A nation so preserved and blessed gives\r\nreverent thanks to God and invokes His guidance and the continuance of\r\nHis care and favor.\r\n\r\nIn our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment\r\nof the Chinese problem. Apart from this our relations with the powers\r\nhave been happy.\r\n\r\nThe recent troubles in China spring from the antiforeign agitation which\r\nfor the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces.\r\nTheir origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in the\r\ntraditions of their Government. The Taiping rebellion and the opening of\r\nChinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike the\r\nhomogeneity and the seclusion of China.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quarters, not alone\r\non the coast, but along the great river arteries and in the remoter\r\ndistricts, carrying new ideas and introducing new associations among a\r\nprimitive people which had pursued for centuries a national policy of\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamers\r\nplying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating\r\nyear by year farther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types\r\nof an alien invasion, changing the course of their national life and\r\nfraught with vague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and their\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nFor several years before the present troubles all the resources of\r\nforeign diplomacy, backed by moral demonstrations of the physical\r\nforce of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure due respect for\r\nthe treaty rights of foreigners and to obtain satisfaction from the\r\nresponsible authorities for the sporadic outrages upon the persons and\r\nproperty of unoffending sojourners, which from time to time occurred at\r\nwidely separated points in the northern provinces, as in the case of the\r\noutbreaks in Sze-chuen and Shan-tung.\r\n\r\nPosting of antiforeign placards became a daily occurrence, which the\r\nrepeated reprobation of the Imperial power failed to check or punish.\r\nThese inflammatory appeals to the ignorance and superstition of the\r\nmasses, mendacious and absurd in their accusations and deeply hostile\r\nin their spirit, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no\r\nparticular class of foreigners; they were impartial in attacking\r\neverything foreign.\r\n\r\nAn outbreak in Shan-tung, in which German missionaries were slain, was\r\nthe too natural result of these malevolent teachings. The posting of\r\nseditious placards, exhorting to the utter destruction of foreigners and\r\nof every foreign thing, continued unrebuked. Hostile demonstrations\r\ntoward the stranger gained strength by organization.\r\n\r\nThe sect, commonly styled the Boxers, developed greatly in the provinces\r\nnorth of the Yang-Tse, and with the collusion of many notable officials,\r\nincluding some in the immediate councils of the Throne itself, became\r\nalarmingly aggressive. No foreigner's life, outside of the protected\r\ntreaty ports, was safe. No foreign interest was secure from spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic representatives of the powers in Peking strove in vain\r\nto check this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by\r\nrenewed protest, to be met with perfunctory edicts from the Palace and\r\nevasive and futile assurances from the Tsung-li Yamen. The circle of the\r\nBoxer influence narrowed about Peking, and while nominally stigmatized\r\nas seditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded the capital itself,\r\nthat the Imperial forces were imbued with its doctrines, and that the\r\nimmediate counselors of the Empress Dowager were in full sympathy with\r\nthe antiforeign movement.\r\n\r\nThe increasing gravity of the conditions in China and the imminence of\r\nperil to our own diversified interests in the Empire, as well as to\r\nthose of all the other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by this\r\nGovernment, causing it profound solicitude. The United States from the\r\nearliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of\r\npeace, omitting no occasions to testify good will, to further the\r\nextension of lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of its Government,\r\nand to insure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest\r\nmeasure of protection for the lives and property of our law-abiding\r\ncitizens and for the exercise of their beneficent callings among the\r\nChinese people.\r\n\r\nMindful of this, it was felt to be appropriate that our purposes should\r\nbe pronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of\r\nthe powers at Peking to promote the administrative reforms so greatly\r\nneeded for strengthening the Imperial Government and maintaining the\r\nintegrity of China, in which we believed the whole western world to be\r\nalike concerned. To these ends I caused to be addressed to the several\r\npowers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of influence in China\r\nthe circular proposals of 1899, inviting from them declarations of their\r\nintentions and views as to the desirability of the adoption of measures\r\ninsuring the benefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade\r\nthroughout China.\r\n\r\nWith gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy,\r\nenabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations\r\nproof of the friendly spirit which animates the various powers\r\ninterested in the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in\r\nthe Chinese Empire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn this conclusion, which I had the gratification to announce as a\r\ncompleted engagement to the interested powers on March 20, 1900, I\r\nhopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust\r\nof foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the\r\npolicy of the Imperial Government, and for the effective exertion by it\r\nof power and authority to quell the critical antiforeign movement in the\r\nnorthern provinces most immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment.\r\n\r\nSeeking to testify confidence in the willingness and ability of the\r\nImperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we\r\nsuffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Peking in\r\nthe autumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at\r\nthe earliest practicable moment, and all pending questions were\r\nremitted, as far as we were concerned, to the ordinary resorts of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government proved, however, unable to check the rising\r\nstrength of the Boxers and appeared to be a prey to internal\r\ndissensions. In the unequal contest the antiforeign influences soon\r\ngained the ascendancy under the leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized\r\narmies of Boxers, with which the Imperial forces affiliated, held the\r\ncountry between Peking and the coast, penetrated into Manchuria up to\r\nthe Russian borders, and through their emissaries threatened a like\r\nrising throughout northern China.\r\n\r\nAttacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property, and slaughter\r\nof native converts were reported from all sides. The Tsung-li Yamen,\r\nalready permeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective\r\nresponse to the appeals of the legations. At this critical juncture, in\r\nthe early spring of this year, a proposal was made by the other powers\r\nthat a combined fleet should be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral\r\ndemonstration, under cover of which to exact of the Chinese Government\r\nrespect for foreign treaty rights and the suppression of the Boxers.\r\n\r\nThe United States, while not participating in the joint demonstration,\r\npromptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for\r\nservice on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at\r\nTaku and sent to Peking for the protection of the American legation.\r\nOther powers took similar action, until some four hundred men were\r\nassembled in the capital as legation guards.\r\n\r\nStill the peril increased. The legations reported the development of the\r\nseditious movement in Peking and the need of increased provision for\r\ndefense against it. While preparations were in progress for a larger\r\nexpedition, to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open,\r\nan attempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by a\r\nfire from the Chinese forts. The forts were thereupon shelled by the\r\nforeign vessels, the American admiral taking no part in the attack,\r\non the ground that we were not at war with China and that a hostile\r\ndemonstration might consolidate the anti-foreign elements and strengthen\r\nthe Boxers to oppose the relieving column.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict.\r\nSeverance of communication with Peking followed, and a combined force\r\nof additional guards, which was advancing to Peking by the Pei-Ho, was\r\nchecked at Langfang. The isolation of the legations was complete.\r\n\r\nThe siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying\r\nhistory. In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the\r\ndevoted band, clinging to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted\r\nspirit that led their relievers through battle and suffering to the\r\ngoal, it is a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that the\r\nhonor of our flag was maintained alike in the siege and the rescue, and\r\nthat stout American hearts have again set high, in fervent emulation\r\nwith true men of other race and language, the indomitable courage that\r\never strives for the cause of right and justice.\r\n\r\nBy June 19 the legations were cut off. An identical note from the Yamen\r\nordered each minister to leave Peking, under a promised escort, within\r\ntwenty-four hours. To gain time they replied, asking prolongation of the\r\ntime, which was afterwards granted, and requesting an interview with the\r\nTsung-li Yamen on the following day. No reply being received, on the\r\nmorning of the 20th the German minister, Baron von Ketteler, set out for\r\nthe Yamen to obtain a response, and on the way was murdered.\r\n\r\nAn attempt by the legation guard to recover his body was foiled by the\r\nChinese. Armed forces turned out against the legations. Their quarters\r\nwere surrounded and attacked. The mission compounds were abandoned,\r\ntheir inmates taking refuge in the British legation, where all the other\r\nlegations and guards gathered for more effective defense. Four hundred\r\npersons were crowded in its narrow compass. Two thousand native converts\r\nwere assembled in a nearby palace under protection of the foreigners.\r\nLines of defense were strengthened, trenches dug, barricades raised, and\r\npreparations made to stand a siege, which at once began.\r\n\r\nFrom June 20 until July 17, writes Minister Conger, \"there was scarcely\r\nan hour during which there was not firing upon some part of our lines\r\nand into some of the legations, varying from a single shot to a general\r\nand continuous attack along the whole line.\" Artillery was placed around\r\nthe legations and on the over-looking palace walls, and thousands of\r\n3-inch shot and shell were fired, destroying some buildings and damaging\r\nall. So thickly did the balls rain, that, when the ammunition of the\r\nbesieged ran low, five quarts of Chinese bullets were gathered in an\r\nhour in one compound and recast.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to burn the legations by setting neighboring houses\r\non fire, but the flames were successfully fought off, although the\r\nAustrian, Belgian, Italian, and Dutch legations were then and\r\nsubsequently burned. With the aid of the native converts, directed by\r\nthe missionaries, to whose helpful co-operation Mr. Conger awards\r\nunstinted praise, the British legation was made a veritable fortress.\r\nThe British minister, Sir Claude MacDonald, was chosen general commander\r\nof the defense, with the secretary of the American legation, Mr. E.G.\r\nSquiers, as chief of staff.\r\n\r\nTo save life and ammunition the besieged sparingly returned the\r\nincessant fire of the Chinese soldiery, fighting only to repel attack or\r\nmake an occasional successful sortie for strategic advantage, such as\r\nthat of fifty-five American, British, and Russian marines led by Captain\r\nMyers, of the United States Marine Corps, which resulted in the capture\r\nof a formidable barricade on the wall that gravely menaced the American\r\nposition. It was held to the last, and proved an invaluable acquisition,\r\nbecause commanding the water gate through which the relief column\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege the defenders lost 65 killed, 135 wounded, and 7 by\r\ndisease--the last all children.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 the besieged had their first communication with the Tsung-li\r\nYamen, from whom a message came inviting to a conference, which was\r\ndeclined. Correspondence, however, ensued and a sort of armistice was\r\nagreed upon, which stopped the bombardment and lessened the rifle fire\r\nfor a time. Even then no protection whatever was afforded, nor any aid\r\ngiven, save to send to the legations a small supply of fruit and three\r\nsacks of flour.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the only communication had with the Chinese Government related\r\nto the occasional delivery or dispatch of a telegram or to the demands\r\nof the Tsung-li Yamen for the withdrawal of the legations to the coast\r\nunder escort. Not only are the protestations of the Chinese Government\r\nthat it protected and succored the legations positively contradicted,\r\nbut irresistible proof accumulates that the attacks upon them were made\r\nby Imperial troops, regularly uniformed, armed, and officered, belonging\r\nto the command of Jung Lu, the Imperial commander in chief. Decrees\r\nencouraging the Boxers, organizing them under prominent Imperial\r\nofficers, provisioning them, and even granting them large sums in the\r\nname of the Empress Dowager, are known to exist. Members of the Tsung-li\r\nYamen who counseled protection of the foreigners were beheaded. Even in\r\nthe distant provinces men suspected of foreign sympathy were put to\r\ndeath, prominent among these being Chang Yen-hoon, formerly Chinese\r\nminister in Washington.\r\n\r\nWith the negotiation of the partial armistice of July 14, a proceeding\r\nwhich was doubtless promoted by the representations of the Chinese envoy\r\nin Washington, the way was opened for the conveyance to Mr. Conger of a\r\ntest message sent by the Secretary of State through the kind offices of\r\nMinister Wu Ting-fang. Mr. Conger's reply, dispatched from Peking on\r\nJuly 18 through the same channel, afforded to the outside world the\r\nfirst tidings that the inmates of the legations were still alive and\r\nhoping for succor.\r\n\r\nThis news stimulated the preparations for a joint relief expedition in\r\nnumbers sufficient to overcome the resistance which for a month had been\r\norganizing between Taku and the capital. Reinforcements sent by all the\r\nco-operating Governments were constantly arriving. The United States\r\ncontingent, hastily assembled from the Philippines or dispatched from\r\nthis country, amounted to some 5,000 men, under the able command first\r\nof the lamented Colonel Liscum and afterwards of General Chaffee.\r\n\r\nToward the end of July the movement began. A severe conflict followed at\r\nTientsin, in which Colonel Liscum was killed. The city was stormed and\r\npartly destroyed. Its capture afforded the base of operations from which\r\nto make the final advance, which began in the first days of August, the\r\nexpedition being made up of Japanese, Russian, British, and American\r\ntroops at the outset.\r\n\r\nAnother battle was fought and won at Yangtsun. Thereafter the\r\ndisheartened Chinese troops offered little show of resistance. A few\r\ndays later the important position of Ho-si-woo was taken. A rapid march\r\nbrought the united forces to the populous city of Tung Chow, which\r\ncapitulated without a contest.\r\n\r\nOn August 14 the capital was reached. After a brief conflict beneath\r\nthe walls the relief column entered and the legations were saved. The\r\nUnited States soldiers, sailors, and marines, officers and men alike,\r\nin those distant climes and unusual surroundings, showed the same valor,\r\ndiscipline, and good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of\r\nintelligence and efficiency which have distinguished them in every\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial family and the Government had fled a few days before.\r\nThe city was without visible control. The remaining Imperial soldiery\r\nhad made on the night of the 13th a last attempt to exterminate the\r\nbesieged, which was gallantly repelled. It fell to the occupying forces\r\nto restore order and organize a provisional administration.\r\n\r\nHappily the acute disturbances were confined to the northern provinces.\r\nIt is a relief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal conduct\r\nof the viceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern\r\nprovinces. Their efforts were continuously directed to the pacific\r\ncontrol of the vast populations under their rule and to the scrupulous\r\nobservance of foreign treaty rights. At critical moments they did not\r\nhesitate to memorialize the Throne, urging the protection of the\r\nlegations, the restoration of communication, and the assertion of the\r\nImperial authority against the subversive elements. They maintained\r\nexcellent relations with the official representatives of foreign powers.\r\nTo their kindly disposition is largely due the success of the consuls in\r\nremoving many of the missionaries from the interior to places of safety.\r\nIn this relation the action of the consuls should be highly commended.\r\nIn Shan-tung and eastern Chi-li the task was difficult, but, thanks to\r\ntheir energy and the cooperation of American and foreign naval\r\ncommanders, hundreds of foreigners, including those of other\r\nnationalities than ours, were rescued from imminent peril.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States through all this trying period was\r\nclearly announced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the\r\npowers dated July 3 proclaimed our attitude. Treating the condition in\r\nthe north as one of virtual anarchy, in which the great provinces of the\r\nsouth and southeast had no share, we regarded the local authorities in\r\nthe latter quarters as representing the Chinese people with whom we\r\nsought to remain in peace and friendship. Our declared aims involved no\r\nwar against the Chinese nation. We adhered to the legitimate office of\r\nrescuing the imperiled legation, obtaining redress for wrongs already\r\nsuffered, securing wherever possible the safety of American life and\r\nproperty in China, and preventing a spread of the disorders or their\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\nAs was then said, \"The policy of the Government of the United States is\r\nto seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to\r\nChina, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect\r\nall rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international\r\nlaw, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial\r\ntrade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.\"\r\n\r\nFaithful to those professions which, as it proved, reflected the views\r\nand purposes of the other co-operating Governments, all our efforts\r\nhave been directed toward ending the anomalous situation in China by\r\nnegotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon\r\nas the sacred duty of relieving our legation and its dependents was\r\naccomplished we withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our legation\r\nunder an adequate guard in Peking as a channel of negotiation and\r\nsettlement--a course adopted by others of the interested powers.\r\nOvertures of the empowered representatives of the Chinese Emperor have\r\nbeen considerately entertained.\r\n\r\nThe Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Imperial power\r\nin Peking has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires,\r\nfor we have held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered\r\nand an enduring settlement that will make their recurrence impossible\r\ncan best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation\r\nreverences and obeys. While so doing we forego no jot of our undoubted\r\nright to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible\r\nauthors and abettors of the criminal acts whereby we and other nations\r\nhave suffered grievous injury.\r\n\r\nFor the real culprits, the evil counselors who have misled the Imperial\r\njudgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends,\r\nfull expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of\r\nretributive justice. Regarding this as the initial condition of an\r\nacceptable settlement between China and the powers, I said in my message\r\nof October 18 to the Chinese Emperor:\r\n\r\n  I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as we and the other offended\r\n  Governments shall be effectively satisfied of Your Majesty's ability and\r\n  power to treat with just sternness the principal offenders, who are\r\n  doubly culpable, not alone toward the foreigners, but toward Your\r\n  Majesty, under whose rule the purpose of China to dwell in concord with\r\n  the world had hitherto found expression in the welcome and protection\r\n  assured to strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking, as a point of departure, the Imperial edict appointing Earl Li\r\nHung Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiaries to arrange a settlement,\r\nand the edict of September 25, whereby certain high officials were\r\ndesignated for punishment, this Government has moved, in concert with\r\nthe other powers, toward the opening of negotiations, which Mr. Conger,\r\nassisted by Mr. Rockhill, has been authorized to conduct on behalf of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nGeneral bases of negotiation formulated by the Government of the French\r\nRepublic have been accepted with certain reservations as to details,\r\nmade necessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations\r\nby other powers, open to discussion in the progress of the negotiations.\r\nThe disposition of the Emperor's Government to admit liability for\r\nwrongs done to foreign Governments and their nationals, and to act upon\r\nsuch additional designation of the guilty persons as the foreign\r\nministers at Peking may be in a position to make, gives hope of a\r\ncomplete settlement of all questions involved, assuring foreign rights\r\nof residence and intercourse on terms of equality for all the world.\r\n\r\nI regard as one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment the\r\nsecurement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since insecurity\r\nof those natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less\r\neffectual assault upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than\r\nwould be the direct invasion thereof.\r\n\r\nThe matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of\r\ngrave concern. Measured in money alone, a sufficient reparation may\r\nprove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur\r\nin emphatic disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through\r\nthe dismemberment of the Empire. I am disposed to think that due\r\ncompensation may be made in part by increased guarantees of security\r\nfor foreign rights and immunities, and, most important of all, by the\r\nopening of China to the equal commerce of all the world. These views\r\nhave been and will be earnestly advocated by our representatives.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Russia has put forward a suggestion, that in the event\r\nof protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities the matter\r\nmay be relegated to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague. I favorably\r\nincline to this, believing that high tribunal could not fail to reach a\r\nsolution no less conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of\r\nChina itself than immediately beneficial to the powers.\r\n\r\nRatifications of a treaty of extradition with the Argentine Republic\r\nwere exchanged on June 2 last.\r\n\r\nWhile the Austro-Hungarian Government has in the many cases that have\r\nbeen reported of the arrest of our naturalized citizens for alleged\r\nevasion of military service faithfully observed the provisions of the\r\ntreaty and released such persons from military obligations, it has in\r\nsome instances expelled those whose presence in the community of their\r\norigin was asserted to have a pernicious influence. Representations have\r\nbeen made against this course whenever its adoption has appeared unduly\r\nonerous.\r\n\r\nWe have been urgently solicited by Belgium to ratify the International\r\nConvention of June, 1899, amendatory of the previous Convention of 1890\r\nin respect to the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa. Compliance\r\nwas necessarily withheld, in the absence of the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate thereto. The principle involved has the cordial sympathy of\r\nthis Government, which in the revisionary negotiations advocated more\r\ndrastic measures, and I would gladly see its extension, by international\r\nagreement, to the restriction of the liquor traffic with all uncivilized\r\npeoples, especially in the Western Pacific.\r\n\r\nA conference will be held at Brussels December 11, 1900, under the\r\nConvention for the protection of industrial property, concluded at\r\nParis March 20, 1883, to which delegates from this country have been\r\nappointed. Any lessening of the difficulties that our inventors\r\nencounter in obtaining patents abroad for their inventions and that\r\nour farmers, manufacturers, and merchants may have in the protection of\r\ntheir trade-marks is worthy of careful consideration, and your attention\r\nwill be called to the results of the conference at the proper time.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expanding trade between this country and South\r\nAmerica, efforts have been made during the past year to conclude\r\nconventions with the southern republics for the enlargement of postal\r\nfacilities. Two such agreements, signed with Bolivia on April 24, of\r\nwhich that establishing the money-order system is undergoing certain\r\nchanges suggested by the Post-Office Department, have not yet been\r\nratified by this Government. A treaty of extradition with that country,\r\nsigned on the same day, is before the Senate.\r\n\r\nA boundary dispute between Brazil and Bolivia over the territory of Acre\r\nis in a fair way of friendly adjustment, a protocol signed in December,\r\n1899, having agreed on a definite frontier and provided for its\r\ndemarcation by a joint commission.\r\n\r\nConditions in Brazil have weighed heavily on our export trade to that\r\ncountry in marked contrast to the favorable conditions upon which\r\nBrazilian products are admitted into our markets. Urgent representations\r\nhave been made to that Government on the subject and some amelioration\r\nhas been effected. We rely upon the reciprocal justice and good will of\r\nthat Government to assure to us a further improvement in our commercial\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe Convention signed May 24, 1897, for the final settlement of claims\r\nleft in abeyance upon the dissolution of the Commission of 1893, was at\r\nlength ratified by the Chilean Congress and the supplemental Commission\r\nhas been organized.\r\n\r\nIt remains for the Congress to appropriate for the necessary expenses of\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nThe insurrectionary movement which disturbed Colombia in the latter part\r\nof 1899 has been practically suppressed, although guerrillas still\r\noperate in some departments. The executive power of that Republic\r\nchanged hands in August last by the act of Vice-President Marroquin in\r\nassuming the reins of government during the absence of President San\r\nClemente from the capital. The change met with no serious opposition,\r\nand, following the precedents in such cases, the United States minister\r\nentered into relations with the new _de facto_ Government on\r\nSeptember 17.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the residual questions between Costa\r\nRica and Nicaragua growing out of the Award of President Cleveland in\r\n1888 have been adjusted through the choice of an American engineer,\r\nGeneral E.P. Alexander, as umpire to run the disputed line. His task has\r\nbeen accomplished to the satisfaction of both contestants.\r\n\r\nA revolution in the Dominican Republic toward the close of last year\r\nresulted in the installation of President Jimenez, whose Government was\r\nformally recognized in January. Since then final payment has been made\r\nof the American claim in regard to the Ozama bridge.\r\n\r\nThe year of the exposition has been fruitful in occasions for displaying\r\nthe good will that exists between this country and France. This great\r\ncompetition brought together from every nation the best in natural\r\nproductions, industry, science, and the arts, submitted in generous\r\nrivalry to a judgment made all the more searching because of that\r\nrivalry. The extraordinary increase of exportations from this country\r\nduring the past three years and the activity with which our inventions\r\nand wares had invaded new markets caused much interest to center upon\r\nthe American exhibit, and every encouragement was offered in the way of\r\nspace and facilities to permit of its being comprehensive as a whole and\r\ncomplete in every part.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not an easy task to assemble exhibits that could fitly\r\nillustrate our diversified resources and manufactures. Singularly\r\nenough, our national prosperity lessened the incentive to exhibit. The\r\ndealer in raw materials knew that the user must come to him; the great\r\nfactories were contented with the phenomenal demand for their output,\r\nnot alone at home, but also abroad, where merit had already won a\r\nprofitable trade.\r\n\r\nAppeals had to be made to the patriotism of exhibitors to induce them\r\nto incur outlays promising no immediate return. This was especially\r\nthe case where it became needful to complete an industrial sequence or\r\nillustrate a class of processes. One manufacturer after another had to\r\nbe visited and importuned, and at times, after a promise to exhibit in a\r\nparticular section had been obtained, it would be withdrawn, owing to\r\npressure of trade orders, and a new quest would have to be made.\r\n\r\nThe installation of exhibits, too, encountered many obstacles and\r\ninvolved unexpected cost. The exposition was far from ready at the date\r\nfixed for its opening. The French transportation lines were congested\r\nwith offered freight. Belated goods had to be hastily installed in\r\nunfinished quarters with whatever labor could be obtained in the\r\nprevailing confusion. Nor was the task of the Commission lightened by\r\nthe fact that, owing to the scheme of classification adopted, it was\r\nimpossible to have the entire exhibit of any one country in the same\r\nbuilding or more than one group of exhibits in the same part of any\r\nbuilding. Our installations were scattered on both sides of the Seine\r\nand in widely remote suburbs of Paris, so that additional assistants\r\nwere needed for the work of supervision and arrangement.\r\n\r\nDespite all these drawbacks the contribution of the United States was\r\nnot only the largest foreign display, but was among the earliest in\r\nplace and the most orderly in arrangement. Our exhibits were shown in\r\none hundred and one out of one hundred and twenty-one classes, and more\r\ncompletely covered the entire classification than those of any other\r\nnation. In total number they ranked next after those of France, and the\r\nattractive form in which they were presented secured general attention.\r\n\r\nA criterion of the extent and success of our participation and of the\r\nthoroughness with which our exhibits were organized is seen in the\r\nawards granted to American exhibitors by the international jury, namely,\r\ngrand prizes, 240; gold medals, 597; silver medals, 776; bronze medals,\r\n541, and honorable mentions, 322--2,476 in all, being the greatest total\r\nnumber given to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation, as well as the\r\nlargest number in each grade. This significant recognition of merit in\r\ncompetition with the chosen exhibits of all other nations and at the\r\nhands of juries almost wholly made up of representatives of France and\r\nother competing countries is not only most gratifying, but is especially\r\nvaluable, since it sets us to the front in international questions of\r\nsupply and demand, while the large proportion of awards in the classes\r\nof art and artistic manufactures afforded unexpected proof of the\r\nstimulation of national culture by the prosperity that flows from\r\nnatural productiveness joined to industrial excellence.\r\n\r\nApart from the exposition several occasions for showing international\r\ngood will occurred. The inauguration in Paris of the Lafayette Monument,\r\npresented by the school children of the United States, and the designing\r\nof a commemorative coin by our Mint and the presentation of the first\r\npiece struck to the President of the Republic, were marked by\r\nappropriate ceremonies, and the Fourth of July was especially observed\r\nin the French capital.\r\n\r\nGood will prevails in our relations with the German Empire. An amicable\r\nadjustment of the long-pending question of the admission of our\r\nlife-insurance companies to do business in Prussia has been reached. One\r\nof the principal companies has already been readmitted and the way is\r\nopened for the others to share the privilege.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Samoan problem, to which I adverted in my last\r\nmessage, has accomplished good results. Peace and contentment prevail in\r\nthe islands, especially in Tutuila, where a convenient administration\r\nthat has won the confidence and esteem of the kindly disposed natives\r\nhas been organized under the direction of the commander of the United\r\nStates naval station at Pago-Pago.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial meat-inspection law has been enacted for Germany. While it\r\nmay simplify the inspections, it prohibits certain products heretofore\r\nadmitted. There is still great uncertainty as to whether our well-nigh\r\nextinguished German trade in meat products can revive under its new\r\nburdens. Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated, which we\r\nconfidently hope will be free from the discriminations which attended\r\nthe enforcement of the old statutes.\r\n\r\nThe remaining link in the new lines of direct telegraphic communication\r\nbetween the United States and the German Empire has recently been\r\ncompleted, affording a gratifying occasion for exchange of friendly\r\ncongratulations with the German Emperor.\r\n\r\nOur friendly relations with Great Britain continue. The war in\r\nSouthern Africa introduced important questions. A condition unusual\r\nin international wars was presented in that while one belligerent had\r\ncontrol of the seas, the other had no ports, shipping, or direct trade,\r\nbut was only accessible through the territory of a neutral. Vexatious\r\nquestions arose through Great Britain's action in respect to neutral\r\ncargoes, not contraband in their own nature, shipped to Portuguese South\r\nAfrica, on the score of probable or suspected ultimate destination to\r\nthe Boer States.\r\n\r\nSuch consignments in British ships, by which alone direct trade is kept\r\nup between our ports and Southern Africa, were seized in application of\r\na municipal law prohibiting British vessels from trading with the enemy\r\nwithout regard to any contraband character of the goods, while cargoes\r\nshipped to Delagoa Bay in neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground\r\nof alleged destination to enemy's country. Appropriate representations\r\non our part resulted in the British Government agreeing to purchase\r\noutright all such goods shown to be the actual property of American\r\ncitizens, thus closing the incident to the satisfaction of the\r\nimmediately interested parties, although, unfortunately, without a broad\r\nsettlement of the question of a neutral's right to send goods not\r\ncontraband _per se_ to a neutral port adjacent to a belligerent\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe work of marking certain provisional boundary points, for convenience\r\nof administration, around the head of Lynn Canal, in accordance with the\r\ntemporary arrangement of October, 1899, was completed by a joint survey\r\nin July last. The _modus vivendi_ has so far worked without\r\nfriction, and the Dominion Government has provided rules and regulations\r\nfor securing to our citizens the benefit of the reciprocal stipulation\r\nthat the citizens or subjects of either power found by that arrangement\r\nwithin the temporary jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no\r\ndiminution of the rights and privileges they have hitherto enjoyed. But\r\nhowever necessary such an expedient may have been to tide over the grave\r\nemergencies of the situation, it is at best but an unsatisfactory\r\nmakeshift, which should not be suffered to delay the speedy and complete\r\nestablishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the\r\nRusso-American treaty for the cession of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may refer again to the need of definitely marking\r\nthe Alaskan boundary where it follows the one hundred and forty-first\r\nmeridian. A convention to that end has been before the Senate for some\r\ntwo years, but as no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a\r\nnew convention for a joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic\r\nobservations. These, it is believed, will give more accurate and\r\nunquestionable results than the sidereal methods heretofore independently\r\nfollowed, which, as is known, proved discrepant at several points on\r\nthe line, although not varying at any place more than 700 feet.\r\n\r\nThe pending claim of R.H. May against the Guatemalan Government has been\r\nsettled by arbitration, Mr. George F.B. Jenner, British minister at\r\nGuatemala, who was chosen as sole arbitrator, having awarded $143,750.73\r\nin gold to the claimant.\r\n\r\nVarious American claims against Haiti have been or are being advanced to\r\nthe resort of arbitration.\r\n\r\nAs the result of negotiations with the Government of Honduras in regard\r\nto the indemnity demanded for the murder of Frank H. Pears in Honduras,\r\nthat Government has paid $10,000 in settlement of the claim of the\r\nheirs.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of King Humbert called forth sincere expressions of\r\nsorrow from this Government and people, and occasion was fitly taken to\r\ntestify to the Italian nation the high regard here felt for the memory\r\nof the lamented ruler.\r\n\r\nIn my last message I referred at considerable length to the lynching of\r\nfive Italians at Tallulah. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal\r\nGovernment, the production of evidence tending to inculpate the authors\r\nof this grievous offense against our civilization, and the repeated\r\ninquests set on foot by the authorities of the State of Louisiana, no\r\npunishments have followed. Successive grand juries have failed to\r\nindict. The representations of the Italian Government in the face of\r\nthis miscarriage have been most temperate and just.\r\n\r\nSetting the principle at issue high above all consideration of merely\r\npecuniary indemnification, such as this Government made in the three\r\nprevious cases, Italy has solemnly invoked the pledges of existing\r\ntreaty and asked that the justice to which she is entitled shall be\r\nmeted in regard to her unfortunate countrymen in our territory with the\r\nsame full measure she herself would give to any American were his\r\nreciprocal treaty rights contemned.\r\n\r\nI renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that the Congress\r\nappropriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class\r\nof international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment may be involved, and I invite action upon the bills to\r\naccomplish this which were introduced in the Senate and House. It is\r\nincumbent upon us to remedy the statutory omission which has led, and\r\nmay again lead, to such untoward results. I have pointed out the\r\nnecessity and the precedent for legislation of this character. Its\r\nenactment is a simple measure of previsory justice toward the nations\r\nwith which we as a sovereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal\r\nobservance.\r\n\r\nWhile the Italian Government naturally regards such action as the\r\nprimary and, indeed, the most essential element in the disposal of the\r\nTallulah incident, I advise that, in accordance with precedent, and in\r\nview of the improbability of that particular case being reached by the\r\nbill now pending, Congress make gracious provision for indemnity to the\r\nItalian sufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn my inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n  Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the\r\n  United States; courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties of the law.\r\n  The preservation of public order, the right of discussion, the integrity\r\n  of courts, and the orderly administration of justice must continue\r\n  forever the rock of safety upon which our Government securely rests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I most urgently reiterate and again invite the attention of my\r\ncountrymen to this reproach upon our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe closing year has witnessed a decided strengthening of Japan's\r\nrelations to other States. The development of her independent judicial\r\nand administrative functions under the treaties which took effect July\r\n17, 1899, has proceeded without international friction, showing the\r\ncompetence of the Japanese to hold a foremost place among modern\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the difficult Chinese problems Japan has acted in\r\nharmonious concert with the other powers, and her generous cooperation\r\nmaterially aided in the joint relief of the beleaguered legations in\r\nPeking and in bringing about an understanding preliminary to a\r\nsettlement of the issues between the powers and China. Japan's\r\ndeclarations in favor of the integrity of the Chinese Empire and the\r\nconservation of open world trade therewith have been frank and positive.\r\nAs a factor for promoting the general interests of peace, order, and\r\nfair commerce in the Far East the influence of Japan can hardly be\r\noverestimated.\r\n\r\nThe valuable aid and kindly courtesies extended by the Japanese\r\nGovernment and naval officers to the battle ship _Oregon_ are\r\ngratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\nComplaint was made last summer of the discriminatory enforcement\r\nof a bubonic quarantine against Japanese on the Pacific coast and of\r\ninterference with their travel in California and Colorado under the\r\nhealth laws of those States. The latter restrictions have been adjudged\r\nby a Federal court to be unconstitutional. No recurrence of either cause\r\nof complaint is apprehended.\r\n\r\nNo noteworthy incident has occurred in our relations with our important\r\nsouthern neighbor. Commercial intercourse with Mexico continues to\r\nthrive, and the two Governments neglect no opportunity to foster their\r\nmutual interests in all practicable ways.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the declaration of the Supreme Court that the awards of\r\nthe late Joint Commission in the La Abra and Weil claims were obtained\r\nthrough fraud, the sum awarded in the first case, $403,030.08, has been\r\nreturned to Mexico, and the amount of the Weil award will be returned in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\nA Convention indefinitely extending the time for the labors of the\r\nUnited States and Mexican International (Water) Boundary Commission has\r\nbeen signed.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am able to announce the formal\r\nnotification at The Hague, on September 4, of the deposit of\r\nratifications of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of\r\nInternational Disputes by sixteen powers, namely, the United States,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, Persia,\r\nPortugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden and Norway, and the\r\nNetherlands. Japan also has since ratified the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration has\r\nbeen organized and has adopted rules of order and a constitution for the\r\nInternational Arbitration Bureau. In accordance with Article XXIII of\r\nthe Convention providing for the appointment by each signatory power\r\nof persons of known competency in questions of international law as\r\narbitrators, I have appointed as members of this Court, Hon. Benjamin\r\nHarrison, of Indiana, ex-President of the United States; Hon. Melville\r\nW. Fuller, of Illinois, Chief Justice of the United States; Hon. John W.\r\nGriggs, of New Jersey, Attorney-General of the United States; and Hon.\r\nGeorge Gray, of Delaware, a judge of the circuit court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs an incident of the brief revolution in the Mosquito district of\r\nNicaragua early in 1899 the insurgents forcibly collected from American\r\nmerchants duties upon imports. On the restoration of order the\r\nNicaraguan authorities demanded a second payment of such duties on the\r\nground that they were due to the titular Government and that their\r\ndiversion had aided the revolt.\r\n\r\nThis position was not accepted by us. After prolonged discussion a\r\ncompromise was effected under which the amount of the second payments\r\nwas deposited with the British consul at San Juan del Norte in trust\r\nuntil the two Governments should determine whether the first payments\r\nhad been made under compulsion to a _de facto_ authority. Agreement\r\nas to this was not reached, and the point was waived by the act of the\r\nNicaraguan Government in requesting the British consul to return the\r\ndeposits to the merchants.\r\n\r\nMenacing differences between several of the Central American States have\r\nbeen accommodated, our ministers rendering good offices toward an\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe all-important matter of an interoceanic canal has assumed a new\r\nphase. Adhering to its refusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture\r\nof the contract of the Maritime Canal Company, which was terminated for\r\nalleged nonexecution in October, 1899, the Government of Nicaragua has\r\nsince supplemented that action by declaring the so-styled Eyre-Cragin\r\noption void for nonpayment of the stipulated advance. Protests in\r\nrelation to these acts have been filed in the State Department and are\r\nunder consideration. Deeming itself relieved from existing engagements,\r\nthe Nicaraguan Government shows a disposition to deal freely with the\r\ncanal question either in the way of negotiations with the United States\r\nor by taking measures to promote the waterway.\r\n\r\nOvertures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the\r\nauspices of the United States are under consideration. In the meantime,\r\nthe views of the Congress upon the general subject, in the light of the\r\nreport of the Commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of\r\nthe various trans-Isthmian ship-canal projects, may be awaited.\r\n\r\nI commend to the early attention of the Senate the Convention with Great\r\nBritain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and to remove any\r\nobjection which might arise out of the Convention commonly called the\r\nClayton-Bulwer Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing contention with Portugal, growing out of the seizure\r\nof the Delagoa Bay Railway, has been at last determined by a favorable\r\naward of the tribunal of arbitration at Berne, to which it was\r\nsubmitted. The amount of the award, which was deposited in London\r\nawaiting arrangements by the Governments of the United States and Great\r\nBritain for its disposal, has recently been paid over to the two\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nA lately signed Convention of Extradition with Peru as amended by the\r\nSenate has been ratified by the Peruvian Congress.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the policy of this Government to refer\r\ninternational disputes to impartial arbitration is seen in the agreement\r\nreached with Russia to submit the claims on behalf of American sealing\r\nvessels seized in Bering Sea to determination by Mr. T.M.C. Asser, a\r\ndistinguished statesman and jurist of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to the Imperial Russian Government for the kindly aid\r\nrendered by its authorities in eastern Siberia to American missionaries\r\nfleeing from Manchuria.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a general\r\ntreaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain, in replacement of the\r\nold treaty, which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war. A new\r\nconvention of extradition is approaching completion, and I should be\r\nmuch pleased were a commercial arrangement to follow. I feel that we\r\nshould not suffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties\r\nthat existed between us and Spain from the time of our earliest\r\nindependence, and to enhance the mutual benefits of that commercial\r\nintercourse which is natural between the two countries.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the Treaty of Peace the line bounding the ceded\r\nPhilippine group in the southwest failed to include several small\r\nislands lying westward of the Sulus, which have always been recognized\r\nas under Spanish control. The occupation of Sibutú and Cagayan Sulu by\r\nour naval forces elicited a claim on the part of Spain, the essential\r\nequity of which could not be gainsaid. In order to cure the defect of\r\nthe treaty by removing all possible ground of future misunderstanding\r\nrespecting the interpretation of its third article, I directed the\r\nnegotiation of a supplementary treaty, which will be forthwith laid\r\nbefore the Senate, whereby Spain quits all title and claim of title to\r\nthe islands named as well as to any and all islands belonging to the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago lying outside the lines described in said third\r\narticle, and agrees that all such islands shall be comprehended in the\r\ncession of the archipelago as fully as if they had been expressly\r\nincluded within those lines. In consideration of this cession the United\r\nStates is to pay to Spain the sum of $100,000.\r\n\r\nA bill is now pending to effect the recommendation made in my last\r\nannual message that appropriate legislation be had to carry into\r\nexecution Article VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain, by which the\r\nUnited States assumed the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its\r\ncitizens against Spain. I ask that action be taken to fulfill this\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden and Norway has accepted the joint invitation of the\r\nUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain to arbitrate claims growing\r\nout of losses sustained in the Samoan Islands in the course of military\r\noperations made necessary by the disturbances in 1899.\r\n\r\nOur claims upon the Government of the Sultan for reparation for injuries\r\nsuffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere give promise of\r\nearly and satisfactory settlement. His Majesty's good disposition in\r\nthis regard has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding\r\nthe American college at Harpoot.\r\n\r\nThe failure of action by the Senate at its last session upon the\r\ncommercial conventions then submitted for its consideration and\r\napproval, although caused by the great pressure of other legislative\r\nbusiness, has caused much disappointment to the agricultural and\r\nindustrial interests of the country, which hoped to profit by their\r\nprovisions. The conventional periods for their ratification having\r\nexpired, it became necessary to sign additional articles extending the\r\ntime for that purpose. This was requested on our part, and the other\r\nGovernments interested have concurred with the exception of one\r\nconvention, in respect to which no formal reply has been received.\r\n\r\nSince my last communication to the Congress on this subject special\r\ncommercial agreements under the third section of the tariff act have\r\nbeen proclaimed with Portugal, with Italy, and with Germany. Commercial\r\nconventions under the general limitations of the fourth section of the\r\nsame act have been concluded with Nicaragua, with Ecuador, with the\r\nDominican Republic, with Great Britain on behalf of the island of\r\nTrinidad, and with Denmark on behalf of the island of St. Croix. These\r\nwill be early communicated to the Senate. Negotiations with other\r\nGovernments are in progress for the improvement and security of our\r\ncommercial relations.\r\n\r\nThe policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles of\r\ninternational equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people\r\nof the United States that there ought to be no hesitation in either\r\nbranch of the Congress in giving to it full effect.\r\n\r\nThis Government desires to preserve the most just and amicable\r\ncommercial relations with all foreign countries, unmoved by the\r\nindustrial rivalries necessarily developed in the expansion of\r\ninternational trade. It is believed that the foreign Governments\r\ngenerally entertain the same purpose, although in some instances there\r\nare clamorous demands upon them for legislation specifically hostile to\r\nAmerican interests. Should these demands prevail I shall communicate\r\nwith the Congress with the view of advising such legislation as may be\r\nnecessary to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of the resources and products of the Western Hemisphere\r\nto be held at Buffalo next year promises important results not only\r\nfor the United States but for the other participating countries. It is\r\ngratifying that the Latin-American States have evinced the liveliest\r\ninterest, and the fact that an International American Congress will\r\nbe held in the City of Mexico while the exposition is in progress\r\nencourages the hope of a larger display at Buffalo than might otherwise\r\nbe practicable. The work of preparing an exhibit of our national\r\nresources is making satisfactory progress under the direction of\r\ndifferent officials of the Federal Government, and the various States of\r\nthe Union have shown a disposition toward the most liberal participation\r\nin the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of the American Republics continues to discharge, with the\r\nhappiest results, the important work of promoting cordial relations\r\nbetween the United States and the Latin-American countries, all of which\r\nare now active members of the International Union. The Bureau has been\r\ninstrumental in bringing about the agreement for another International\r\nAmerican Congress, which is to meet in the City of Mexico in October,\r\n1901. The Bureau's future for another term of ten years is assured by\r\nthe international compact, but the congress will doubtless have much to\r\ndo with shaping new lines of work and a general policy. Its usefulness\r\nto the interests of Latin-American trade is widely appreciated and shows\r\na gratifying development.\r\n\r\nThe practical utility of the consular service in obtaining a wide range\r\nof information as to the industries and commerce of other countries and\r\nthe opportunities thereby afforded for introducing the sale of our goods\r\nhave kept steadily in advance of the notable expansion of our foreign\r\ntrade, and abundant evidence has been furnished, both at home and\r\nabroad, of the fact that the Consular Reports, including many from our\r\ndiplomatic representatives, have to a considerable extent pointed out\r\nways and means of disposing of a great variety of manufactured goods\r\nwhich otherwise might not have found sale abroad.\r\n\r\nTestimony of foreign observers to the commercial efficiency of the\r\nconsular corps seems to be conclusive, and our own manufacturers and\r\nexporters highly appreciate the value of the services rendered not only\r\nin the printed reports but also in the individual efforts of consular\r\nofficers to promote American trade. An increasing part of the work of\r\nthe Bureau of Foreign Commerce, whose primary duty it is to compile and\r\nprint the reports, is to answer inquiries from trade organizations,\r\nbusiness houses, etc., as to conditions in various parts of the world,\r\nand, notwithstanding the smallness of the force employed, the work has\r\nbeen so systematized that responses are made with such promptitude and\r\naccuracy as to elicit flattering encomiums. The experiment of printing\r\nthe Consular Reports daily for immediate use by trade bodies, exporters,\r\nand the press, which was begun in January, 1898, continues to give\r\ngeneral satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for\r\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 1900, were $79,527,060.18. For the six\r\npreceding years we had only deficits, the aggregate of which from 1894\r\nto 1899, inclusive, amounted to $283,022,991.14. The receipts for the\r\nyear from all sources, exclusive of postal revenues, aggregated\r\n$567,240,851.89, and expenditures for all purposes, except for the\r\nadministration of the postal department, aggregated $487,713,791.71.\r\nThe receipts from customs were $233,164,871.16, an increase over the\r\npreceding year of $27,036,389.41. The receipts from internal revenue\r\nwere $295,327,926.76, an increase of $21,890,765.25 over 1899. The\r\nreceipts from miscellaneous sources were $38,748,053.97, as against\r\n$36,394,976.92 for the previous year.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying also to note that during the year a considerable\r\nreduction is shown in the expenditures of the Government. The War\r\nDepartment expenditures for the fiscal year 1900 were $134,774,767.78,\r\na reduction of $95,066,486.69 over those of 1899. In the Navy Department\r\nthe expenditures were $55,953,077.72 for the year 1900, as against\r\n$63,942,104.25 for the preceding year, a decrease of $7,989,026.53. In\r\nthe expenditures on account of Indians there was a decrease in 1900 over\r\n1899 of $2,630,604.38; and in the civil and miscellaneous expenses for\r\n1900 there was a reduction of $13,418,065.74.\r\n\r\nBecause of the excess of revenues over expenditures the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was enabled to apply bonds and other securities to the sinking\r\nfund to the amount of $56,544,556.06. The details of the sinking fund\r\nare set forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which\r\nI invite attention. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the\r\nreceipts for the current fiscal year will aggregate $580,000,000 and\r\nthe expenditures $500,000,000, leaving an excess of revenues over\r\nexpenditures of $80,000,000. The present condition of the Treasury is\r\none of undoubted strength. The available cash balance November 30 was\r\n$139,303,794.50. Under the form of statement prior to the financial law\r\nof March 14 last there would have been included in the statement of\r\navailable cash gold coin and bullion held for the redemption of United\r\nStates notes.\r\n\r\nIf this form were pursued, the cash balance including the present gold\r\nreserve of $150,000,000, would be $289,303,794.50. Such balance November\r\n30, 1899, was $296,495,301.55. In the general fund, which is wholly\r\nseparate from the reserve and trust funds, there was on November 30,\r\n$70,090,073.15 in gold coin and bullion, to which should be added\r\n$22,957,300 in gold certificates subject to issue, against which there\r\nis held in the Division of Redemption gold coin and bullion, making a\r\ntotal holding of free gold amounting to $93,047,373.15.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the\r\nCongress to provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the\r\ncontinued parity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic\r\nmoney, silver and gold.\r\n\r\nOur surplus revenues have permitted the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nsince the close of the fiscal year to call in the funded loan of 1891\r\ncontinued at 2 per cent, in the sum of $25,364,500. To and including\r\nNovember 30, $23,458,100 of these bonds have been paid. This sum,\r\ntogether with the amount which may accrue from further redemptions under\r\nthe call, will be applied to the sinking fund.\r\n\r\nThe law of March 14, 1900, provided for refunding into 2 per cent\r\nthirty-year bonds, payable, principal and interest, in gold coin of the\r\npresent standard value, that portion of the public debt represented by\r\nthe 3 per cent bonds of 1908, the 4 percents of 1907, and the 5 percents\r\nof 1904, of which there was outstanding at the date of said law\r\n$839,149,930. The holders of the old bonds presented them for exchange\r\nbetween March 14 and November 30 to the amount of $364,943,750. The net\r\nsaving to the Government on these transactions aggregates $9,106,166.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the operation, as stated by the Secretary, is to\r\nreduce the charge upon the Treasury for the payment of interest from the\r\ndates of refunding to February 1, 1904, by the sum of more than seven\r\nmillion dollars annually. From February 1, 1904, to July 1, 1907, the\r\nannual interest charge will be reduced by the sum of more than five\r\nmillions, and for the thirteen months ending August 1, 1908, by about\r\none million. The full details of the refunding are given in the annual\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900, so far as it\r\nrelates to a modification of the national banking act, is already\r\napparent. The provision for the incorporation of national banks with a\r\ncapital of not less than $25,000 in places not exceeding three thousand\r\ninhabitants has resulted in the extension of banking facilities to many\r\nsmall communities hitherto unable to provide themselves with banking\r\ninstitutions under the national system. There were organized from the\r\nenactment of the law up to and including November 30, 369 national\r\nbanks, of which 266 were with capital less than $50,000, and 103 with\r\ncapital of $50,000 or more.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organized\r\nunder the new law are in sections where the need of banking facilities\r\nhas been most pronounced. Iowa stands first, with 30 banks of the\r\nsmaller class, while Texas, Oklahoma, Indian Territory, and the middle\r\nand western sections of the country have also availed themselves largely\r\nof the privileges under the new law.\r\n\r\nA large increase in national-bank-note circulation has resulted from the\r\nprovision of the act which permits national banks to issue circulating\r\nnotes to the par value of the United States bonds deposited as security\r\ninstead of only 90 per cent thereof, as heretofore. The increase in\r\ncirculating notes from March 14 to November 30 is $77,889,570.\r\n\r\nThe party in power is committed to such legislation as will better make\r\nthe currency responsive to the varying needs of business at all seasons\r\nand in all sections.\r\n\r\nOur foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrial\r\nprogress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the country exceeded two billions of dollars. The exports are\r\ngreater than they have ever been before, the total for the fiscal year\r\n1900 being $1,394,483,082, an increase over 1899 of $167,459,780, an\r\nincrease over 1898 of $163,000,752, over 1897 of $343,489,526, and\r\ngreater than 1896 by $511,876,144.\r\n\r\nThe growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat exports of manufactured products largely exceed those of any\r\nprevious year, their value for 1900 being $433,851,756, against\r\n$339,592,146 in 1899, an increase of 28 per cent.\r\n\r\nAgricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume\r\nthan in 1899, the total for the year being $835,858,123, against\r\n$784,776,142 in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe imports for the year amounted to $849,941,184, an increase over 1899\r\nof $152,792,695. This increase is largely in materials for manufacture,\r\nand is in response to the rapid development of manufacturing in the\r\nUnited States. While there was imported for use in manufactures in 1900\r\nmaterial to the value of $79,768,972 in excess of 1899, it is reassuring\r\nto observe that there is a tendency toward decrease in the importation\r\nof articles manufactured ready for consumption, which in 1900 formed\r\n15.17 per cent of the total imports, against 15.54 per cent in 1899 and\r\n21.09 per cent in 1896.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress at its present session reduce the\r\ninternal-revenue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with\r\nSpain in the sum of thirty millions of dollars. This reduction should be\r\nsecured by the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be\r\nthe most burdensome to the industries of the people.\r\n\r\nI specially urge that there be included in whatever reduction is made\r\nthe legacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary, educational,\r\nor charitable character.\r\n\r\nAmerican vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per\r\ncent of our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry the least,\r\nnot the greatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our\r\nsteel industries, the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade,\r\nand our steadily maintained expenditures for the Navy have created an\r\nopportunity to place the United States in the first rank of commercial\r\nmaritime powers.\r\n\r\nBesides realizing a proper national aspiration this will mean the\r\nestablishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive\r\nnational industry, expanding the field for the profitable employment of\r\nlabor and capital. It will increase the transportation facilities and\r\nreduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the\r\ninterior to the seaboard for export, and will strengthen an arm of the\r\nnational defense upon which the founders of the Government and their\r\nsuccessors have relied. In again urging immediate action by the Congress\r\non measures to promote American shipping and foreign trade, I direct\r\nattention to the recommendations on the subject in previous messages,\r\nand particularly to the opinion expressed in the message of 1899:\r\n\r\n  I am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to\r\n  our merchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and\r\n  upbuild our sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and\r\n  manufacture, which, with the increase of our Navy, mean more work and\r\n  wages to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests\r\n  in every part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress is invited to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in his annual report for legislation in behalf\r\nof the Revenue-Cutter Service, and favorable action is urged.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message to the Congress I called attention to the\r\nnecessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to\r\nexist in connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts,\r\nand again invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time,\r\nwhich concluded with these words:\r\n\r\n  It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in\r\n  the several States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such\r\n  uniformity, founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is\r\n  injurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations, may\r\n  be obtained, and that means may be found for the Congress, within the\r\n  limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement an effective\r\n  code of State legislation as to make a complete system of laws\r\n  throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance\r\n  of the salutary rules to which I have referred.\r\n\r\n  The whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no\r\n  part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have\r\n  the studied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and\r\n  judicious action.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestraint upon such combinations as are injurious, and which are within\r\nFederal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition of\r\naffairs in the Philippines. While seeking to impress upon you that the\r\ngrave responsibility of the future government of those islands rests\r\nwith the Congress of the United States, I abstained from recommending\r\nat that time a specific and final form of government for the territory\r\nactually held by the United States forces and in which as long as\r\ninsurrection continues the military arm must necessarily be supreme.\r\nI stated my purpose, until the Congress shall have made the formal\r\nexpression of its will, to use the authority vested in me by the\r\nConstitution and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates in those distant islands as in all other places where our flag\r\nrightfully floats, placing, to that end, at the disposal of the army and\r\nnavy all the means which the liberality of the Congress and the people\r\nhave provided. No contrary expression of the will of the Congress having\r\nbeen made, I have steadfastly pursued the purpose so declared, employing\r\nthe civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification and the\r\ninstitution of local governments within the lines of authority and law.\r\n\r\nProgress in the hoped-for direction has been favorable. Our forces have\r\nsuccessfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the\r\norganized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrative\r\nregularity to all quarters. What opposition remains is for the most part\r\nscattered, obeying no concerted plan of strategic action, operating only\r\nby the methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which,\r\nwhile ineffective to alter the general control now established, are\r\nstill sufficient to beget insecurity among the populations that have\r\nfelt the good results of our control and thus delay the conferment upon\r\nthem of the fuller measures of local self-government, of education, and\r\nof industrial and agricultural development which we stand ready to give\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of this year the effective opposition of the dissatisfied\r\nTagals to the authority of the United States was virtually ended, thus\r\nopening the door for the extension of a stable administration over much\r\nof the territory of the Archipelago. Desiring to bring this about, I\r\nappointed in March last a civil Commission composed of the Hon. William\r\nH. Taft, of Ohio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; the Hon. Luke I.\r\nWright, of Tennessee; the Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof.\r\nBernard Moses, of California. The aims of their mission and the scope of\r\ntheir authority are clearly set forth in my instructions of April 7,\r\n1900, addressed to the Secretary of War to be transmitted to them:\r\n\r\n  In the message transmitted to the Congress on the 5th of December, 1899,\r\n  I said, speaking of the Philippine Islands: \"As long as the insurrection\r\n  continues the military arm must necessarily be supreme. But there is no\r\n  reason why steps should not be taken from time to time to inaugurate\r\n  governments essentially popular in their form as fast as territory is\r\n  held and controlled by our troops. To this end I am considering the\r\n  advisability of the return of the Commission, or such of the members\r\n  thereof as can be secured, to aid the existing authorities and\r\n  facilitate this work throughout the islands.\"\r\n\r\n  To give effect to the intention thus expressed, I have appointed Hon.\r\n  William H. Taft, of Ohio; Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan; Hon.\r\n  Luke I. Wright, of Tennessee; Hon. Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, and Prof.\r\n  Bernard Moses, of California, Commissioners to the Philippine Islands\r\n  to continue and perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil\r\n  government already commenced by the military authorities, subject in\r\n  all respects to any laws which Congress may hereafter enact.\r\n\r\n  The Commissioners named will meet and act as a board, and the Hon.\r\n  William H. Taft is designated as president of the board. It is probable\r\n  that the transfer of authority from military commanders to civil\r\n  officers will be gradual and will occupy a considerable period. Its\r\n  successful accomplishment and the maintenance of peace and order in the\r\n  meantime will require the most perfect co-operation between the civil\r\n  and military authorities in the islands, and both should be directed\r\n  during the transition period by the same Executive Department. The\r\n  Commission will therefore report to the Secretary of War, and all their\r\n  action will be subject to your approval and control.\r\n\r\n  You will instruct the Commission to proceed to the city of Manila,\r\n  where they will make their principal office, and to communicate with\r\n  the Military Governor of the Philippine Islands, whom you will at the\r\n  same time direct to render to them every assistance within his power\r\n  in the performance of their duties. Without hampering them by too\r\n  specific instructions, they should in general be enjoined, after making\r\n  themselves familiar with the conditions and needs of the country, to\r\n  devote their attention in the first instance to the establishment of\r\n  municipal governments, in which the natives of the islands, both in the\r\n  cities and in the rural communities, shall be afforded the opportunity\r\n  to manage their own local affairs to the fullest extent of which they\r\n  are capable and subject to the least degree of supervision and control\r\n  which a careful study of their capacities and observation of the\r\n  workings of native control show to be consistent with the maintenance\r\n  of law, order, and loyalty.\r\n\r\n  The next subject in order of importance should be the organization of\r\n  government in the larger administrative divisions corresponding to\r\n  counties, departments, or provinces, in which the common interests of\r\n  many or several municipalities falling within the same tribal lines,\r\n  or the same natural geographical limits, may best be subserved by\r\n  a common administration. Whenever the Commission is of the opinion\r\n  that the condition of affairs in the islands is such that the central\r\n  administration may safely be transferred from military to civil control\r\n  they will report that conclusion to you, with their recommendations as\r\n  to the form of central government to be established for the purpose of\r\n  taking over the control.\r\n\r\n  Beginning with the 1st day of September, 1900, the authority to\r\n  exercise, subject to my approval, through the Secretary of War, that\r\n  part of the power of government in the Philippine Islands which is of a\r\n  legislative nature is to be transferred from the Military Governor of\r\n  the islands to this Commission, to be thereafter exercised by them in\r\n  the place and stead of the Military Governor, under such rules and\r\n  regulations as you shall prescribe, until the establishment of the civil\r\n  central government for the islands contemplated in the last foregoing\r\n  paragraph, or until Congress shall otherwise provide. Exercise of this\r\n  legislative authority will include the making of rules and orders,\r\n  having the effect of law, for the raising of revenue by taxes, customs\r\n  duties, and imposts; the appropriation and expenditure of public funds\r\n  of the islands; the establishment of an educational system throughout\r\n  the islands; the establishment of a system to secure an efficient civil\r\n  service; the organization and establishment of courts; the organization\r\n  and establishment of municipal and departmental governments, and all\r\n  other matters of a civil nature for which the Military Governor is now\r\n  competent to provide by rules or orders of a legislative character.\r\n\r\n  The Commission will also have power during the same period to appoint to\r\n  office such officers under the judicial, educational, and civil-service\r\n  systems and in the municipal and departmental governments as shall be\r\n  provided for. Until the complete transfer of control the Military\r\n  Governor will remain the chief executive head of the government of the\r\n  islands, and will exercise the executive authority now possessed by him\r\n  and not herein expressly assigned to the Commission, subject, however,\r\n  to the rules and orders enacted by the Commission in the exercise of the\r\n  legislative powers conferred upon them. In the meantime the municipal\r\n  and departmental governments will continue to report to the Military\r\n  Governor and be subject to his administrative supervision and control,\r\n  under your direction, but that supervision and control will be confined\r\n  within the narrowest limits consistent with the requirement that the\r\n  powers of government in the municipalities and departments shall be\r\n  honestly and effectively exercised and that law and order and individual\r\n  freedom shall be maintained.\r\n\r\n  All legislative rules and orders, establishments of government, and\r\n  appointments to office by the Commission will take effect immediately,\r\n  or at such times as they shall designate, subject to your approval\r\n  and action upon the coming in of the Commission's reports, which are\r\n  to be made from time to time as their action is taken. Wherever civil\r\n  governments are constituted under the direction of the Commission\r\n  such military posts, garrisons, and forces will be continued for the\r\n  suppression of insurrection and brigandage and the maintenance of law\r\n  and order as the Military Commander shall deem requisite, and the\r\n  military forces shall be at all times subject, under his orders, to the\r\n  call of the civil authorities for the maintenance of law and order and\r\n  the enforcement of their authority.\r\n\r\n  In the establishment of municipal governments the Commission will take\r\n  as the basis of their work the governments established by the Military\r\n  Governor under his order of August 8, 1899, and under the report of the\r\n  board constituted by the Military Governor by his order of January 29,\r\n  1900, to formulate and report a plan of municipal government, of which\r\n  His Honor Cayetano Arellano, President of the Audiencia, was chairman,\r\n  and they will give to the conclusions of that board the weight and\r\n  consideration which the high character and distinguished abilities of\r\n  its members justify.\r\n\r\n  In the constitution of departmental or provincial governments they will\r\n  give especial attention to the existing government of the island of\r\n  Negros, constituted with the approval of the people of that island,\r\n  under the order of the Military Governor of July 22, 1899, and after\r\n  verifying, so far as may be practicable, the reports of the successful\r\n  working of that government they will be guided by the experience thus\r\n  acquired so far as it may be applicable to the condition existing in\r\n  other portions of the Philippines. They will avail themselves, to the\r\n  fullest degree practicable, of the conclusions reached by the previous\r\n  Commission to the Philippines.\r\n\r\n  In the distribution of powers among the governments organized by the\r\n  Commission, the presumption is always to be in favor of the smaller\r\n  subdivision, so that all the powers which can properly be exercised by\r\n  the municipal government shall be vested in that government, and all\r\n  the powers of a more general character which can be exercised by the\r\n  departmental government shall be vested in that government, and so\r\n  that in the governmental system, which is the result of the process,\r\n  the central government of the islands, following the example of\r\n  the distribution of the powers between the States and the National\r\n  Government of the United States, shall have no direct administration\r\n  except of matters of purely general concern, and shall have only such\r\n  supervision and control over local governments as may be necessary to\r\n  secure and enforce faithful and efficient administration by local\r\n  officers.\r\n\r\n  The many different degrees of civilization and varieties of custom\r\n  and capacity among the people of the different islands preclude very\r\n  definite instruction as to the part which the people shall take in the\r\n  selection of their own officers; but these general rules are to be\r\n  observed: That in all cases the municipal officers who administer the\r\n  local affairs of the people, are to be selected by the people, and that\r\n  wherever officers of more extended jurisdiction are to be selected in\r\n  any way, natives of the islands are to be preferred, and if they can be\r\n  found competent and willing to perform the duties, they are to receive\r\n  the offices in preference to any others.\r\n\r\n  It will be necessary to fill some offices for the present with Americans\r\n  which after a time may well be filled by natives of the islands. As\r\n  soon as practicable a system for ascertaining the merit and fitness of\r\n  candidates for civil office should be put in force. An indispensable\r\n  qualification for all offices and positions of trust and authority in\r\n  the islands must be absolute and unconditional loyalty to the United\r\n  States, and absolute and unhampered authority and power to remove and\r\n  punish any officer deviating from that standard must at all times be\r\n  retained in the hands of the central authority of the islands.\r\n\r\n  In all the forms of government and administrative provisions which\r\n  they are authorized to prescribe the Commission should bear in mind\r\n  that the government which they are establishing is designed not for our\r\n  satisfaction, or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for\r\n  the happiness, peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine\r\n  Islands, and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their\r\n  customs, their habits, and even their prejudices, to the fullest extent\r\n  consistent with the accomplishment of the indispensable requisites of\r\n  just and effective government.\r\n\r\n  At the same time the Commission should bear in mind, and the people\r\n  of the islands should be made plainly to understand, that there are\r\n  certain great principles of government which have been made the basis\r\n  of our governmental system which we deem essential to the rule of law\r\n  and the maintenance of individual freedom, and of which they have,\r\n  unfortunately, been denied the experience possessed by us; that there\r\n  are also certain practical rules of government which we have found to\r\n  be essential to the preservation of these great principles of liberty\r\n  and law, and that these principles and these rules of government must\r\n  be established and maintained in their islands for the sake of their\r\n  liberty and happiness, however much they may conflict with the customs\r\n  or laws of procedure with which they are familiar.\r\n\r\n  It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the Philippine\r\n  Islands fully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules,\r\n  and they will inevitably within a short time command universal assent.\r\n  Upon every division and branch of the government of the Philippines,\r\n  therefore, must be imposed these inviolable rules:\r\n\r\n  That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without\r\n  due process of law; that private property shall not be taken for public\r\n  use without just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the\r\n  accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be\r\n  informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted\r\n  with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining\r\n  witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his\r\n  defense; that excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines\r\n  imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person\r\n  shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense, or be compelled in\r\n  any criminal case to be a witness against himself; that the right to be\r\n  secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated;\r\n  that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except as a\r\n  punishment for crime; that no bill of attainder or _ex-post-facto_\r\n  law shall be passed; that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom\r\n  of speech or of the press, or the rights of the people to peaceably\r\n  assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances; that\r\n  no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or\r\n  prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and\r\n  enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or\r\n  preference shall forever be allowed.\r\n\r\n  It will be the duty of the Commission to make a thorough investigation\r\n  into the titles to the large tracts of land held or claimed by\r\n  individuals or by religious orders; into the justice of the claims and\r\n  complaints made against such landholders by the people of the island or\r\n  any part of the people, and to seek by wise and peaceable measures a\r\n  just settlement of the controversies and redress of wrongs which have\r\n  caused strife and bloodshed in the past. In the performance of this duty\r\n  the Commission is enjoined to see that no injustice is done; to have\r\n  regard for substantial rights and equity, disregarding technicalities so\r\n  far as substantial right permits, and to observe the following rules:\r\n\r\n  That the provision of the Treaty of Paris pledging the United States\r\n  to the protection of all rights of property in the islands, and as\r\n  well the principle of our own Government which prohibits the taking of\r\n  private property without due process of law, shall not be violated;\r\n  that the welfare of the people of the islands, which should be a\r\n  paramount consideration, shall be attained consistently with this rule\r\n  of property right; that if it becomes necessary for the public interest\r\n  of the people of the islands to dispose of claims to property which the\r\n  Commission finds to be not lawfully acquired and held disposition shall\r\n  be made thereof by due legal procedure, in which there shall be full\r\n  opportunity for fair and impartial hearing and judgment; that if the\r\n  same public interests require the extinguishment of property rights\r\n  lawfully acquired and held due compensation shall be made out of the\r\n  public treasury therefor; that no form of religion and no minister of\r\n  religion shall be forced upon any community or upon any citizen of the\r\n  islands; that, upon the other hand, no minister of religion shall be\r\n  interfered with or molested in following his calling, and that the\r\n  separation between State and Church shall be real, entire, and absolute.\r\n\r\n  It will be the duty of the Commission to promote and extend, and,\r\n  as they find occasion, to improve the system of education already\r\n  inaugurated by the military authorities. In doing this they should\r\n  regard as of first importance the extension of a system of primary\r\n  education which shall be free to all, and which shall tend to fit the\r\n  people for the duties of citizenship and for the ordinary avocations of\r\n  a civilized community. This instruction should be given in the first\r\n  instance in every part of the islands in the language of the people.\r\n  In view of the great number of languages spoken by the different tribes,\r\n  it is especially important to the prosperity of the islands that a\r\n  common medium of communication may be established, and it is obviously\r\n  desirable that this medium should be the English language. Especial\r\n  attention should be at once given to affording full opportunity to all\r\n  the people of the islands to acquire the use of the English language.\r\n\r\n  It may be well that the main changes which should be made in the system\r\n  of taxation and in the body of the laws under which the people are\r\n  governed, except such changes as have already been made by the military\r\n  government, should be relegated to the civil government which is to be\r\n  established under the auspices of the Commission. It will, however, be\r\n  the duty of the Commission to inquire diligently as to whether there\r\n  are any further changes which ought not to be delayed, and if so, they\r\n  are authorized to make such changes subject to your approval. In doing\r\n  so they are to bear in mind that taxes which tend to penalize or repress\r\n  industry and enterprise are to be avoided; that provisions for taxation\r\n  should be simple, so that they may be understood by the people; that\r\n  they should affect the fewest practicable subjects of taxation which\r\n  will serve for the general distribution of the burden.\r\n\r\n  The main body of the laws which regulate the rights and obligations of\r\n  the people should be maintained with as little interference as possible.\r\n  Changes made should be mainly in procedure, and in the criminal laws to\r\n  secure speedy and impartial trials, and at the same time effective\r\n  administration and respect for individual rights.\r\n\r\n  In dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the islands the Commission\r\n  should adopt the same course followed by Congress in permitting the\r\n  tribes of our North American Indians to maintain their tribal\r\n  organization and government, and under which many of those tribes are\r\n  now living in peace and contentment, surrounded by a civilization to\r\n  which they are unable or unwilling to conform. Such tribal governments\r\n  should, however, be subjected to wise and firm regulation, and, without\r\n  undue or petty interference, constant and active effort should be\r\n  exercised to prevent barbarous practices and introduce civilized\r\n  customs.\r\n\r\n  Upon all officers and employees of the United States, both civil and\r\n  military, should be impressed a sense of the duty to observe not merely\r\n  the material but the personal and social rights of the people of the\r\n  islands, and to treat them with the same courtesy and respect for their\r\n  personal dignity which the people of the United States are accustomed\r\n  to require from each other.\r\n\r\n  The articles of capitulation of the city of Manila on the 13th of\r\n  August, 1898, concluded with these words:\r\n\r\n  \"This city, its inhabitants, its churches and religious worship,\r\n  its educational establishments, and its private property of all\r\n  descriptions, are placed under the special safeguard of the faith and\r\n  honor of the American Army.\"\r\n\r\n  I believe that this pledge has been faithfully kept. As high and\r\n  sacred an obligation rests upon the Government of the United States to\r\n  give protection for property and life, civil and religious freedom, and\r\n  wise, firm, and unselfish guidance in the paths of peace and prosperity\r\n  to all the people of the Philippine Islands. I charge this Commission\r\n  to labor for the full performance of this obligation, which concerns\r\n  the honor and conscience of their country, in the firm hope that through\r\n  their labors all the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands may come to\r\n  look back with gratitude to the day when God gave victory to American\r\n  arms at Manila and set their land under the sovereignty and the\r\n  protection of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincidently with the entrance of the Commission upon its labors I\r\ncaused to be issued by General MacArthur, the Military Governor of the\r\nPhilippines, on June 21, 1900, a proclamation of amnesty in generous\r\nterms, of which many of the insurgents took advantage, among them a\r\nnumber of important leaders.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, composed of eminent citizens representing the diverse\r\ngeographical and political interests of the country, and bringing\r\nto their task the ripe fruits of long and intelligent service in\r\neducational, administrative, and judicial careers, made great progress\r\nfrom the outset. As early as August 21, 1900, it submitted a preliminary\r\nreport, which will be laid before the Congress, and from which it\r\nappears that already the good effects of returning order are felt; that\r\nbusiness, interrupted by hostilities, is improving as peace extends;\r\nthat a larger area is under sugar cultivation than ever before; that the\r\ncustoms revenues are greater than at any time during the Spanish rule;\r\nthat economy and efficiency in the military administration have created\r\na surplus fund of $6,000,000, available for needed public improvements;\r\nthat a stringent civil-service law is in preparation; that railroad\r\ncommunications are expanding, opening up rich districts, and that a\r\ncomprehensive scheme of education is being organized.\r\n\r\nLater reports from the Commission show yet more encouraging advance\r\ntoward insuring the benefits of liberty and good government to the\r\nFilipinos, in the interest of humanity and with the aim of building up\r\nan enduring, self-supporting, and self-administering community in those\r\nfar eastern seas. I would impress upon the Congress that whatever\r\nlegislation may be enacted in respect to the Philippine Islands should\r\nbe along these generous lines. The fortune of war has thrown upon this\r\nnation an unsought trust which should be unselfishly discharged, and\r\ndevolved upon this Government a moral as well as material responsibility\r\ntoward these millions whom we have freed from an oppressive yoke.\r\n\r\nI have on another occasion called the Filipinos \"the wards of the\r\nnation.\" Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed; it must not\r\nbe otherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit\r\nthose who have come under our fostering care. It is our duty so to treat\r\nthem that our flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and\r\nthe fertile zones of Mindanao and Negros than it is at home, that there\r\nas here it shall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlightenment, and\r\nprogress in every avenue of development.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge.\r\nHe would be rash who, with the teachings of contemporaneous history in\r\nview, would fix a limit to the degree of culture and advancement yet\r\nwithin the reach of these people if our duty toward them be faithfully\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe civil government of Puerto Rico provided for by the act of the\r\nCongress approved April 12, 1900, is in successful operation. The courts\r\nhave been established. The Governor and his associates, working\r\nintelligently and harmoniously, are meeting with commendable success.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November a general election was held in the island for\r\nmembers of the Legislature, and the body elected has been called to\r\nconvene on the first Monday of December.\r\n\r\nI recommend that legislation be enacted by the Congress conferring upon\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior supervision over the public lands in\r\nPuerto Rico, and that he be directed to ascertain the location and\r\nquantity of lands the title to which remained in the Crown of Spain\r\nat the date of cession of Puerto Rico to the United States, and that\r\nappropriations necessary for surveys be made, and that the methods of\r\nthe disposition of such lands be prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, 1900, I directed that a call be issued for an\r\nelection in Cuba for members of a constitutional convention to frame a\r\nconstitution as a basis for a stable and independent government in the\r\nisland. In pursuance thereof the Military Governor issued the following\r\ninstructions:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the Congress of the United States, by its joint resolution of\r\n  April 20, 1898, declared--\r\n\r\n  \"That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be,\r\n  free and independent.\r\n\r\n  \"That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to\r\n  exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except\r\n  for the pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that\r\n  is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to\r\n  its people;\"\r\n\r\n  And whereas, the people of Cuba have established municipal governments,\r\n  deriving their authority from the suffrages of the people given under\r\n  just and equal laws, and are now ready, in like manner, to proceed to\r\n  the establishment of a general government which shall assume and\r\n  exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, and control over the island:\r\n\r\n  Therefore, it is ordered that a general election be held in the island\r\n  of Cuba on the third Saturday of September, in the year nineteen\r\n  hundred, to elect delegates to a convention to meet in the city of\r\n  Havana at twelve o'clock noon on the first Monday of November, in the\r\n  year nineteen hundred, to frame and adopt a constitution for the people\r\n  of Cuba, and as a part thereof to provide for and agree with the\r\n  Government of the United States upon the relations to exist between that\r\n  Government and the Government of Cuba, and to provide for the election\r\n  by the people of officers under such constitution and the transfer of\r\n  government to the officers so elected.\r\n\r\n  The election will be held in the several voting precincts of the island\r\n  under, and pursuant to, the provisions of the electoral law of April 18,\r\n  1900, and the amendments thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election was held on the 15th of September, and the convention\r\nassembled on the 5th of November, 1900, and is now in session.\r\n\r\nIn calling the convention to order, the Military Governor of Cuba made\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n  As Military Governor of the island, representing the President of the\r\n  United States, I call this convention to order.\r\n\r\n  It will be your duty, first, to frame and adopt a constitution for Cuba,\r\n  and when that has been done to formulate what in your opinion ought to\r\n  be the relations between Cuba and the United States.\r\n\r\n  The constitution must be adequate to secure a stable, orderly, and free\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  When you have formulated the relations which in your opinion ought to\r\n  exist between Cuba and the United States the Government of the United\r\n  States will doubtless take such action on its part as shall lead to a\r\n  final and authoritative agreement between the people of the two\r\n  countries to the promotion of their common interests.\r\n\r\n  All friends of Cuba will follow your deliberations with the deepest\r\n  interest, earnestly desiring that you shall reach just conclusions, and\r\n  that by the dignity, individual self-restraint, and wise conservatism\r\n  which shall characterize your proceedings the capacity of the Cuban\r\n  people for representative government may be signally illustrated.\r\n\r\n  The fundamental distinction between true representative government and\r\n  dictatorship is that in the former every representative of the people,\r\n  in whatever office, confines himself strictly within the limits of his\r\n  defined powers. Without such restraint there can be no free\r\n  constitutional government.\r\n\r\n  Under the order pursuant to which you have been elected and convened you\r\n  have no duty and no authority to take part in the present government of\r\n  the island. Your powers are strictly limited by the terms of that order.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the convention concludes its labors I will transmit to the Congress\r\nthe constitution as framed by the convention for its consideration and\r\nfor such action as it may deem advisable.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my special message of February 10,\r\n1899, as to the necessity for cable communication between the United\r\nStates and Hawaii, with extension to Manila. Since then circumstances\r\nhave strikingly emphasized this need. Surveys have shown the entire\r\nfeasibility of a chain of cables which at each stopping place shall\r\ntouch on American territory, so that the system shall be under our own\r\ncomplete control. Manila once within telegraphic reach, connection with\r\nthe systems of the Asiatic coast would open increased and profitable\r\nopportunities for a more direct cable route from our shores to the\r\nOrient than is now afforded by the trans-Atlantic, continental, and\r\ntrans-Asian lines. I urge attention to this important matter.\r\n\r\nThe present strength of the Army is 100,000 men--65,000 regulars and\r\n35,000 volunteers. Under the act of March 2, 1899, on the 30th of June\r\nnext the present volunteer force will be discharged and the Regular Army\r\nwill be reduced to 2,447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a Board of Officers convened by President Cleveland adopted a\r\ncomprehensive scheme of coast-defense fortifications which involved the\r\noutlay of something over one hundred million dollars. This plan received\r\nthe approval of the Congress, and since then regular appropriations have\r\nbeen made and the work of fortification has steadily progressed.\r\n\r\nMore than sixty millions of dollars have been invested in a great number\r\nof forts and guns, with all the complicated and scientific machinery and\r\nelectrical appliances necessary for their use. The proper care of this\r\ndefensive machinery requires men trained in its use. The number of men\r\nnecessary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the War\r\nDepartment, at a minimum allowance, to be 18,420.\r\n\r\nThere are fifty-eight or more military posts in the United States other\r\nthan the coast-defense fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe number of these posts is being constantly increased by the Congress.\r\nMore than $22,000,000 have been expended in building and equipment,\r\nand they can only be cared for by the Regular Army. The posts now in\r\nexistence and others to be built provide for accommodations for, and if\r\nfully garrisoned require, 26,000 troops. Many of these posts are along\r\nour frontier or at important strategic points, the occupation of which\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\nWe have in Cuba between 5,000 and 6,000 troops. For the present our\r\ntroops in that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, and\r\ncertainly not until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional\r\nconvention now in session and a government provided by the new\r\nconstitution shall have been established and its stability assured.\r\n\r\nIn Puerto Rico we have reduced the garrisons to 1,636, which includes\r\n879 native troops. There is no room for further reduction here.\r\n\r\nWe will be required to keep a considerable force in the Philippine\r\nIslands for some time to come. From the best information obtainable we\r\nwill need there for the immediate future from 45,000 to 60,000 men.\r\nI am sure the number may be reduced as the insurgents shall come to\r\nacknowledge the authority of the United States, of which there are\r\nassuring indications.\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent that we will require an army of about 60,000, and\r\nthat during present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines the President\r\nshould have authority to increase the force to the present number of\r\n100,000. Included in this number authority should be given to raise\r\nnative troops in the Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taft Commission\r\nbelieve will be more effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas,\r\nassassins, and ladrones than our own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe full discussion of this subject by the Secretary of War in his\r\nannual report is called to your earnest attention.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my last annual message that the\r\nCongress provide a special medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars,\r\nsailors, and marines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained\r\nin the service after their terms of enlistment had expired.\r\n\r\nI favor the recommendation of the Secretary of War for the detail\r\nof officers from the line of the Army when vacancies occur in the\r\nAdjutant-General's Department, Inspector-General's Department,\r\nQuartermaster's Department, Subsistence Department, Pay Department,\r\nOrdnance Department, and Signal Corps.\r\n\r\nThe Army cannot be too highly commended for its faithful and effective\r\nservice in active military operations in the field and the difficult\r\nwork of civil administration.\r\n\r\nThe continued and rapid growth of the postal service is a sure index\r\nof the great and increasing business activity of the country. Its most\r\nstriking new development is the extension of rural free delivery. This\r\nhas come almost wholly within the last year. At the beginning of the\r\nfiscal year 1899-1900 the number of routes in operation was only 391,\r\nand most of these had been running less than twelve months. On the\r\n15th of November, 1900, the number had increased to 2,614, reaching\r\ninto forty-four States and Territories, and serving a population of\r\n1,801,524. The number of applications now pending and awaiting action\r\nnearly equals all those granted up to the present time, and by the\r\nclose of the current fiscal year about 4,000 routes will have been\r\nestablished, providing for the daily delivery of mails at the scattered\r\nhomes of about three and a half millions of rural population.\r\n\r\nThis service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces to\r\ngood roads, and quickens and extends the dissemination of general\r\ninformation. Experience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension\r\nthat it would be so expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make\r\nit a serious burden. Its actual application has shown that it increases\r\npostal receipts, and can be accompanied by reductions in other branches\r\nof the service, so that the augmented revenues and the accomplished\r\nsavings together materially reduce the net cost. The evidences which\r\npoint to these conclusions are presented in detail in the annual report\r\nof the Postmaster-General, which with its recommendations is commended\r\nto the consideration of the Congress. The full development of this\r\nspecial service, however, requires such a large outlay of money that\r\nit should be undertaken only after a careful study and thorough\r\nunderstanding of all that it involves.\r\n\r\nVery efficient service has been rendered by the Navy in connection with\r\nthe insurrection in the Philippines and the recent disturbance in China.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory settlement has been made of the long-pending\r\nquestion of the manufacture of armor plate. A reasonable price has been\r\nsecured and the necessity for a Government armor plant avoided.\r\n\r\nI approve of the recommendations of the Secretary for new vessels and\r\nfor additional officers and men which the required increase of the Navy\r\nmakes necessary. I commend to the favorable action of the Congress the\r\nmeasure now pending for the erection of a statue to the memory of the\r\nlate Admiral David D. Porter. I commend also the establishment of a\r\nnational naval reserve and of the grade of vice-admiral. Provision\r\nshould be made, as recommended by the Secretary, for suitable rewards\r\nfor special merit. Many officers who rendered the most distinguished\r\nservice during the recent war with Spain have received in return no\r\nrecognition from the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe total area of public lands as given by the Secretary of the Interior\r\nis approximately 1,071,881,662 acres, of which 917,135,880 acres are\r\nundisposed of and 154,745,782 acres have been reserved for various\r\npurposes. The public lands disposed of during the year amount to\r\n13,453,887.96 acres, including 62,423.09 acres of Indian lands, an\r\nincrease of 4,271,474.80 over the preceding year. The total receipts\r\nfrom the sale of public lands during the fiscal year were $4,379,758.10,\r\nan increase of $1,309,620.76 over the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from our forest policy have demonstrated its wisdom\r\nand the necessity in the interest of the public for its continuance and\r\nincreased appropriations by the Congress for the carrying on of the\r\nwork. On June 30, 1900, there were thirty-seven forest reserves, created\r\nby Presidential proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3,\r\n1891, embracing an area of 46,425,529 acres.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Olympic Reserve, in the State of Washington,\r\nwas reduced 265,040 acres, leaving its present area at 1,923,840 acres.\r\nThe Prescott Reserve, in Arizona, was increased from 10,240 acres to\r\n423,680 acres, and the Big Horn Reserve, in Wyoming, was increased from\r\n1,127,680 acres to 1,180,800 acres. A new reserve, the Santa Ynez, in\r\nCalifornia, embracing an area of 145,000 acres, was created during this\r\nyear. On October 10, 1900, the Crow Creek Forest Reserve, in Wyoming,\r\nwas created, with an area of 56,320 acres.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fiscal year there were on the pension roll 993,529\r\nnames, a net increase of 2,010 over the fiscal year 1899. The number\r\nadded to the rolls during the year was 45,344. The amount disbursed for\r\nArmy pensions during the year was $134,700,597.24 and for Navy pensions\r\n$3,761,533.41, a total of $138,462,130.65, leaving an unexpended balance\r\nof $5,542,768.25 to be covered into the Treasury, which shows an\r\nincrease over the previous year's expenditure of $107,077.70. There were\r\n684 names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at\r\nthe first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress.\r\n\r\nThe act of May 9, 1900, among other things provides for an extension\r\nof income to widows pensioned under said act to $250 per annum. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior believes that by the operations of this act\r\nthe number of persons pensioned under it will increase and the increased\r\nannual payment for pensions will be between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government justly appreciates the services of its soldiers and\r\nsailors by making pension payments liberal beyond precedent to them,\r\ntheir widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nThere were 26,540 letters patent granted, including reissues and\r\ndesigns, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1900; 1,660 trademarks,\r\n682 labels, and 93 prints registered. The number of patents which\r\nexpired was 19,988. The total receipts for patents were $1,358,228.35.\r\nThe expenditures were $1,247,827.58, showing a surplus of $110,400.77.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress is called to the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior touching the necessity for the further establishment of\r\nschools in the Territory of Alaska, and favorable action is invited\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nMuch interesting information is given in the report of the Governor of\r\nHawaii as to the progress and development of the islands during the\r\nperiod from July 7, 1898, the date of the approval of the joint\r\nresolution of the Congress providing for their annexation, up to April\r\n30, 1900, the date of the approval of the act providing a government for\r\nthe Territory, and thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe last Hawaiian census, taken in the year 1896, gives a total\r\npopulation of 109,020, of which 31,019 were native Hawaiians. The number\r\nof Americans reported was 8,485. The results of the Federal census,\r\ntaken this year, show the islands to have a total population of 154,001,\r\nshowing an increase over that reported in 1896 of 44,981, or 41.2 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThere has been marked progress in the educational, agricultural, and\r\nrailroad development of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Territorial act of April 30, 1900, section 7 of said act repeals\r\nChapter 34 of the Civil Laws of Hawaii whereby the Government was to\r\nassist in encouraging and developing the agricultural resources of the\r\nRepublic, especially irrigation. The Governor of Hawaii recommends\r\nlegislation looking to the development of such water supply as may exist\r\non the public lands, with a view of promoting land settlement. The\r\nearnest consideration of the Congress is invited to this important\r\nrecommendation and others, as embodied in the report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Census states that the work in connection with the\r\nTwelfth Census is progressing favorably. This national undertaking,\r\nordered by the Congress each decade, has finally resulted in the\r\ncollection of an aggregation of statistical facts to determine the\r\nindustrial growth of the country, its manufacturing and mechanical\r\nresources, its richness in mines and forests, the number of its\r\nagriculturists, their farms and products, its educational and religious\r\nopportunities, as well as questions pertaining to sociological\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the officials in charge of the Bureau indicate that the\r\nfour important and most-desired subjects, namely, population,\r\nagricultural, manufacturing, and vital statistics, will be completed\r\nwithin the limit prescribed by the law of March 3, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe field work incident to the above inquiries is now practically\r\nfinished, and as a result the population of the States and Territories,\r\nincluding the Hawaiian Islands and Alaska, has been announced. The\r\ngrowth of population during the last decade amounts to over 13,000,000,\r\na greater numerical increase than in any previous census in the history\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nBulletins will be issued as rapidly as possible giving the population by\r\nStates and Territories, by minor civil divisions. Several announcements\r\nof this kind have already been made, and it is hoped that the list will\r\nbe completed by January 1. Other bulletins giving the results of the\r\nmanufacturing and agricultural inquiries will be given to the public as\r\nrapidly as circumstances will admit.\r\n\r\nThe Director, while confident of his ability to complete the\r\ndifferent branches of the undertaking in the allotted time, finds\r\nhimself embarrassed by the lack of a trained force properly equipped for\r\nstatistical work, thus raising the question whether in the interest of\r\neconomy and a thorough execution of the census work there should not\r\nbe retained in the Government employ a certain number of experts not\r\nonly to aid in the preliminary organization prior to the taking of the\r\ndecennial census, but in addition to have the advantage in the field and\r\noffice work of the Bureau of trained assistants to facilitate the early\r\ncompletion of this enormous undertaking.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress at its present session apportion\r\nrepresentation among the several States as provided by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has been extending its work during the\r\npast year, reaching farther for new varieties of seeds and plants;\r\nco-operating more fully with the States and Territories in research\r\nalong useful lines; making progress in meteorological work relating to\r\nlines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for ocean-going vessels;\r\ncontinuing inquiry as to animal disease; looking into the extent\r\nand character of food adulteration; outlining plans for the care,\r\npreservation, and intelligent harvesting of our woodlands; studying\r\nsoils that producers may cultivate with better knowledge of conditions,\r\nand helping to clothe desert places with grasses suitable to our arid\r\nregions. Our island possessions are being considered that their peoples\r\nmay be helped to produce the tropical products now so extensively\r\nbrought into the United States. Inquiry into methods of improving our\r\nroads has been active during the year; help has been given to many\r\nlocalities, and scientific investigation of material in the States and\r\nTerritories has been inaugurated. Irrigation problems in our semiarid\r\nregions are receiving careful and increased consideration.\r\n\r\nAn extensive exhibit at Paris of the products of agriculture has made\r\nthe peoples of many countries more familiar with the varied products of\r\nour fields and their comparative excellence.\r\n\r\nThe collection of statistics regarding our crops is being improved and\r\nsources of information are being enlarged, to the end that producers may\r\nhave the earliest advices regarding crop conditions. There has never\r\nbeen a time when those for whom it was established have shown more\r\nappreciation of the services of the Department.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December 5, 1898, I called attention to the\r\nnecessity for some amendment of the alien contract law. There still\r\nremain important features of the rightful application of the eight-hour\r\nlaw for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration, and I\r\nagain commend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThat there may be secured the best service possible in the Philippine\r\nIslands, I have issued, under date of November 30, 1900, the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n  The United States Civil Service Commission is directed to render such\r\n  assistance as may be practicable to the Civil Service Board, created\r\n  under the act of the United States Philippine Commission, for the\r\n  establishment and maintenance of an honest and efficient civil service\r\n  in the Philippine Islands, and for that purpose to conduct examinations\r\n  for the civil service of the Philippine Islands, upon the request of the\r\n  Civil Service Board of said islands, under such regulations as may be\r\n  agreed upon by the said Board and the said United States Civil Service\r\n  Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commission is greatly embarrassed in its work for\r\nwant of an adequate permanent force for clerical and other assistance.\r\nIts needs are fully set forth in its report. I invite attention to\r\nthe report, and especially urge upon the Congress that this important\r\nbureau of the public service, which passes upon the qualifications and\r\ncharacter of so large a number of the officers and employees of the\r\nGovernment, should be supported by all needed appropriations to secure\r\npromptness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nI am very much impressed with the statement made by the heads of all the\r\nDepartments of the urgent necessity of a hall of public records. In\r\nevery departmental building in Washington, so far as I am informed, the\r\nspace for official records is not only exhausted, but the walls of rooms\r\nare lined with shelves, the middle floor space of many rooms is filled\r\nwith file cases, and garrets and basements, which were never intended\r\nand are unfitted for their accommodation, are crowded with them. Aside\r\nfrom the inconvenience there is great danger, not only from fire, but\r\nfrom the weight of these records upon timbers not intended for their\r\nsupport. There should be a separate building especially designed for the\r\npurpose of receiving and preserving the annually accumulating archives\r\nof the several Executive Departments. Such a hall need not be a costly\r\nstructure, but should be so arranged as to admit of enlargement from\r\ntime to time. I urgently recommend that the Congress take early action\r\nin this matter.\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Congress a resolution adopted at a recent meeting of\r\nthe American Bar Association concerning the proposed celebration of John\r\nMarshall Day, February 4, 1901. Fitting exercises have been arranged,\r\nand it is earnestly desired by the committee that the Congress may\r\nparticipate in this movement to honor the memory of the great jurist.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the Government to this city is a fact of great\r\nhistorical interest. Among the people there is a feeling of genuine\r\npride in the Capital of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of interest in this connection that in 1800 the\r\npopulation of the District of Columbia was 14,093; to-day it is 278,718.\r\nThe population of the city of Washington was then 3,210; to-day it is\r\n218,196.\r\n\r\nThe Congress having provided for \"an appropriate national celebration\r\nof the Centennial Anniversary of the Establishment of the Seat of the\r\nGovernment in the District of Columbia,\" the committees authorized by it\r\nhave prepared a programme for the 12th of December, 1900, which date has\r\nbeen selected as the anniversary day. Deep interest has been shown in\r\nthe arrangements for the celebration by the members of the committees\r\nof the Senate and House of Representatives, the committee of Governors\r\nappointed by the President, and the committees appointed by the citizens\r\nand inhabitants of the District of Columbia generally. The programme, in\r\naddition to a reception and other exercises at the Executive Mansion,\r\nprovides commemorative exercises to be held jointly by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives in the Hall of the House of Representatives,\r\nand a reception in the evening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in honor\r\nof the Governors of the States and Territories.\r\n\r\nIn our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it invites of\r\nextravagance in Government expenditures and appropriations; and the\r\nchosen representatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish an\r\nexample in their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of\r\nplenty husbands for the future. In this era of great business activity\r\nand opportunity caution is not untimely. It will not abate, but\r\nstrengthen, confidence. It will not retard, but promote, legitimate\r\nindustrial and commercial expansion. Our growing power brings with it\r\ntemptations and perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must\r\nnot be used to invite conflicts, nor for oppression, but for the more\r\neffective maintenance of those principles of equality and justice upon\r\nwhich our institutions and happiness depend. Let us keep always in mind\r\nthat the foundation of our Government is liberty; its superstructure\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 4, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, copy of a letter\r\nfrom the Commissioner-General of the United States to the Paris\r\nExposition of 1900, of November 17, 1900, giving a detailed statement of\r\nthe expenditures of the commission for the year ended November 15, 1900.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 6, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report from the Secretary of State and\r\naccompanying papers relating to the claim against the United States of\r\nthe Russian subject, Gustav Isak Dahlberg, master and principal owner of\r\nthe Russian bark _Hans_, based on his wrongful and illegal arrest\r\nand imprisonment by officers of the United States District Court for the\r\nsouthern district of Mississippi, and, in view of the opinion expressed\r\nby the Department of Justice that the said arrest and detention of the\r\ncomplainant were wrongful and without the authority of law, I recommend\r\nthe appropriation by Congress of the sum of $5,000 to reimburse the\r\nmaster and owners of the vessel for all losses and damages incurred by\r\nreason of his said wrongful and illegal arrest and detention.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 6, 1900_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, in relation to the lynching, in La Salle County,\r\nTex., on October 5, 1895, of Florentine Suaste, a Mexican citizen.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course pursued in the case of the lynching of three\r\nItalian subjects at Hahnville, La., on August 8, 1896, and in that of\r\nthe lynching of the Mexican citizen, Luis Moreno, at Yreka, Cal., in\r\nAugust, 1895, I recommend the appropriation by Congress, out of humane\r\nconsideration, and without reference to the question of liability of the\r\nGovernment of the United States, of the sum of $2,000, to be paid by the\r\nSecretary of State to the Government of Mexico, and by that Government\r\ndistributed to the heirs of the above-mentioned Florentino Suaste.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 3, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to a resolution of the Senate of December 19, 1900, directing\r\nthe Secretary of War \"to transmit to the Senate the report of Abraham L.\r\nLawshe, giving in detail the result of his investigations, made under\r\nthe direction of the War Department, into the receipts and expenditures\r\nof Cuban funds,\" the Senate is informed that for the reasons stated in\r\nthe accompanying communication from the Secretary of War, dated December\r\n28, 1900, it is not deemed compatible with the public interest to\r\ntransmit the report to the Senate at this time.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 16, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith for the information of the Congress a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture, in which he presents a preliminary report\r\nof investigations upon the forests of the southern Appalachian Mountain\r\nregion. Upon the basis of the facts established by this investigation\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture recommends the purchase of land for a\r\nnational forest reserve in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee,\r\nand adjacent States. I commend to the favorable consideration of\r\nCongress the reasons upon which this recommendation rests.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 25, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nFor the information of the Congress and with a view to such action on\r\nits part as it may deem wise and appropriate I transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of War, made to me under date of January 24, 1901, containing\r\nthe reports of the Taft commission, its several acts of legislation, and\r\nother important information relating to the conditions and immediate\r\nwants of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend legislation under which the government of the\r\nislands may have authority to assist in their peaceful industrial\r\ndevelopment in the directions indicated by the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 29, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State relating to\r\nthe treaty between the United States and Spain, signed at Washington,\r\nNovember 7, 1900, providing for the cession of any and all islands of\r\nthe Philippine Archipelago lying outside of the lines described in\r\nArticle III of the treaty of peace of December 10, 1898.\r\n\r\nI recommend the appropriation by Congress during the present session of\r\nthe sum of one hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of carrying out\r\nthe obligations of the United States under the treaty.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 29, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State relating to the\r\nlynching of two Italian subjects at Tallulah, La., on July 20, 1899.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my annual message to the Congress on\r\nDecember 3, 1900, that in accordance with precedent Congress make\r\ngracious provision for indemnity to the families of the victims in the\r\nsame form as heretofore.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 29, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State\r\naccompanying the Commercial Relations of the United States for the year\r\n1900, being the annual and other reports of consular and diplomatic\r\nofficers upon the industries and commerce of foreign countries, with\r\nparticular reference to the growing share of the United States in\r\ninternational trade. The advance in the general efficiency of our\r\nconsular service in promoting trade, which was noted in my message of\r\nMarch 1, 1900, transmitting the reports for 1899, was even more marked\r\nthan last year. The promptitude with which the reports of the consuls\r\nare printed and distributed, the generous recognition which is being\r\nincreasingly accorded by our business interests to the practical value\r\nof their efforts for enlarging trade, and the continued testimony of\r\ncompetent foreign authorities to the general superiority of their\r\ncommercial work, have naturally had a stimulating effect upon its\r\nconsular corps as a whole, and experience in the discharge of their\r\nduties adds greatly to their efficiency. It is gratifying to be able to\r\nstate that the improvement in the service, following closely upon the\r\nsteady progress in expediting the publication of reports, has enabled\r\nthe Department of State this year to submit the annual reports a month\r\nin advance of the usual time, and to make them as nearly as possible a\r\ncontemporaneous picture of the trade of the world. In view of the great\r\nimportance of these reports to our producers, manufacturers, exporters,\r\nand business interest generally, I cordially approve the recommendation\r\nof the Secretary of State that Congress shall authorize the printing as\r\nheretofore of an edition of 10,000 copies of the summary, entitled\r\n\"Review of the World's Commerce,\" and of 5,000 copies of Commercial\r\nRelations (including this summary), to be distributed by the Department\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 14, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nDuring our recent war with Spain the United States naval force on the\r\nNorth Atlantic Station was charged with varied and important duties,\r\nchief among which were the maintenance of the blockade of Cuba, aiding\r\nthe army, and landing troops and in subsequent operations, and\r\nparticularly in the pursuit, blockade, and destruction of the Spanish\r\nSquadron under Admiral Cervera.\r\n\r\nThis naval campaign, embracing objects of wide scope and grave\r\nresponsibilities, was conducted with great ability on the part of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, and of the officers and enlisted men under his\r\ncommand. It culminated in the annihilation of the Spanish fleet in the\r\nbattle of July 3, 1898, one of the most memorable naval engagements in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe result of this battle was the freeing of our Atlantic coast from the\r\npossibilities to which it had been exposed from Admiral Cervera's fleet,\r\nand the termination of the war upon the seas.\r\n\r\nI recommend that, following our national precedents, especially that\r\nin the case of Admiral Dewey and the Asiatic Squadron, the thanks of\r\nCongress be given to Rear-Admiral William T. Sampson, United States\r\nNavy, and to the officers and men under his command for highly\r\ndistinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy, and in carrying on\r\nthe blockade and naval campaign on the Cuban coast, resulting in the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish fleet at Santiago de Cuba July 3, 1898.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 21, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the Congress and with a view\r\nto its publication in suitable form, if such action is deemed desirable,\r\na special report of the United States Board on Geographic Names,\r\nrelating to geographic names in the Philippine Islands, and invite\r\nattention to the recommendation of the Board:\r\n\r\n\"That in addition to the usual number, there be printed 15,000 copies:\r\n2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, 3,000 copies for the use of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and 10,000 copies for distribution by the\r\nBoard to the Executive Departments and the public.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 26, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, in connection\r\nwith my message of January 29, 1901, relative to the lynching of certain\r\nItalian subjects at Tallulah, La., a report by the Secretary of State\r\ntouching a claim for $5,000 presented by the Italian ambassador at\r\nWashington on behalf of Guiseppe Defina, on account of his being obliged\r\nto abandon his home and business.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 28, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in pursuance of the act of Congress approved July\r\n1, 1898 (U.S. Stat. L., vol. 30, pp. 645, 646), the report of Mr.\r\nFerdinand W. Peck, commissioner-general of the United States to the\r\nInternational Exposition held at Paris, France, during the year 1900.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 1, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith, without approval, House bill No. 3204, entitled \"An\r\nact to refer certain claims for Indian depredations to the Court of\r\nClaims.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral relief has been extended to citizens who have lost property by\r\nreason of Indian depredations by the act of March 3, 1891, conferring\r\njurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to hear and determine such cases.\r\nThat act provides for payment for damages growing out of depredations\r\ncommitted by any Indian or Indians belonging to a band, tribe, or nation\r\nin amity with the United States, excluding from consideration all claims\r\nwhich originated during the existence of actual hostilities between the\r\nUnited States and the Indian tribe.\r\n\r\nIn making this discrimination the act of 1891 follows the general\r\nprinciple which has been asserted in all general legislation which has\r\never been enacted for the payment of claims for property destroyed by\r\nIndians. The first act which promised such indemnity, that of May 19,\r\n1796, contained the same restriction, and it was reported in every\r\nsubsequent general act of Congress dealing with the subject. This\r\npolicy, which has been clearly manifested from the beginning, is in\r\naccord with the recognized principle that the nation is not liable for\r\ndamage to the private property of its citizens caused by the act of the\r\npublic enemy. This statute has been thoroughly considered by the Court\r\nof Claims and by the Supreme Court and its interpretation fixed, and it\r\nhas been declared to be in accord not only with the policy of Congress\r\nas expressed through the legislation of the century, but with the\r\ngeneral principles of international law.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the records of the Court of Claims show that the\r\nclaims of four of the five beneficiaries named in the present bill\r\nhave been presented to that court under the general law and decided\r\nadversely, the court having held that a state of war existed between\r\nthe United States and the Sioux Indians in the year 1862 when the\r\nclaims arose. The remaining claim, which originated under the same\r\ncircumstances and at the same time, would, of course, be subject to\r\nthe same defense if presented.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides that these claims shall be sent back to the Court of\r\nClaims for trial according to the principles and rules which governed\r\nthe commission appointed under the act of February 16, 1863. That act,\r\nwhich was a special act relating to losses occurring during the\r\nhostilities of the previous year, did not, of course, impose the\r\nrequirement of amity, the claims allowed by the commission being paid\r\nout of the funds belonging to the hostile Indians sequestered by the\r\nstatute. The effect of this bill, if it became a law, would be to\r\nprovide for the payment out of the Treasury of the United States of\r\nthese claims which were not presented for payment out of the Indian\r\nfunds and which have been rejected by the courts under the general law.\r\nThere are many hundreds of cases, aggregating a large amount claimed,\r\nwhich have been filed in the Court of Claims, but which are excluded\r\nfrom its jurisdiction for the same reason which necessitated the\r\ndismissal of the petitions filed by these claimants. There is no legal\r\nobligation on the part of the United States, and no promise, express or\r\nimplied, for the payment of such claims.\r\n\r\nThe measure of governmental liability is fulfilled by the passage of the\r\nact of March 3, 1891, and the prompt payment of the judgments rendered\r\nthereunder. To single out for payment a few claims of this large class\r\nto the exclusion of all others would, in my judgment, be unjust; and\r\nsuch action would also with reason be cited as a precedent for extending\r\ngovernmental aid in all similar cases.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given I am constrained to withhold my approval from the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 7, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in response to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of February 19, 1901,\r\nrequesting him to furnish that body \"all the information in the\r\npossession of the State Department relating to the shipment of horses\r\nand mules from New Orleans in large numbers for the use of the British\r\narmy in the war in South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 2, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith, without approval, House bill No. 321, entitled \"An\r\nact for the relief of the legal representative of Samuel Tewksbury,\r\ndeceased.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provides for the payment to the legal representative of Samuel\r\nTewksbury, late of Scranton, Allegheny County, Pa., the sum of $5,697\r\nin full compensation for the use and occupation by the United States\r\nGovernment of the brick building and premises owned by him in the city\r\nof Scranton, Pa., as a depot or barracks for United States troops by the\r\nProvost Marshal of the United States from June, 1862, to June, 1865,\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department show that about April 26, 1865, Col.\r\nJ.G. Johnson, Chief Quartermaster, forwarded to the office of the\r\nQuartermaster-General a claim of Samuel Tewksbury for use of a building\r\nat Scranton, Pa., from February 24, 1864, to February 3, 1865, Stated at\r\n$1,133.33, and damage to said building at $1,400, total $2,533.33.\r\n\r\nIn forwarding these papers Colonel Johnson states as follows:\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1864 Mr. Samuel Tewksbury presented to me through his\r\n  agents a claim against the United States Government for use of the\r\n  premises mentioned in the enclosed account accompanying the papers.\r\n\r\n  I learn from Mr. S.N. Bradford, Provost Marshal of the Twelfth District\r\n  of Pennsylvania at Scranton, that lodgings were furnished to persons in\r\n  military service at that place by Gardiner and Atkinson under a contract\r\n  with the Provost Marshal, also that the contractors rented the building\r\n  used for the above purpose from Mr. Tewksbury.\r\n\r\n  Considering it a matter entirely between that gentleman and his tenants,\r\n  Messrs. Gardiner and Atkinson, I at that time refused to take any action\r\n  in the matter whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim was again submitted to the office of the Quartermaster-General\r\non September 30, 1865, by Major W.B. Lane, and was returned on May 1,\r\n1866, with the information that the United States had already paid for\r\nlodging of the troops under the control of the Provost Marshal at\r\nScranton, Pa., during the time for which charge for rent is made.\r\n\r\nThe claimant was referred to the officer or person by whom the building\r\nwas taken for compensation for its use. No other record of this case is\r\nfound in the War Department, although it will be observed that the bill\r\ncovers a period from June, 1862, to June, 1865, inclusive, while the\r\nclaim as originally presented to the War Department was for occupancy of\r\nthe building at Scranton, Pa., from February 24, 1864, to February 3,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that when this claim was originally presented it was\r\nexamined by the proper representative of the Government, and was\r\nrejected; that no such use and occupation as the United States\r\nGovernment had of claimant's building was under a contract between the\r\nGovernment and the tenants of claimant, and that payment therefor was\r\nduly made by the Government. Now after a lapse of some thirty-seven\r\nyears the period of use and occupation covered by the claim has\r\nincreased threefold, and the compensation asked therefor has more than\r\ndoubled. Under the circumstances of this case I do not feel at liberty\r\nto approve the bill.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT McKINLEY'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nWhen we assembled here on the 4th of March, 1897, there was great\r\nanxiety with regard to our currency and credit. None exists now. Then\r\nour Treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations\r\nof the Government. Now they are sufficient for all public needs, and we\r\nhave a surplus instead of a deficit. Then I felt constrained to convene\r\nthe Congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the\r\nordinary expenses of the Government. Now I have the satisfaction to\r\nannounce that the Congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum\r\nof $41,000,000. Then there was deep solicitude because of the long\r\ndepression in our manufacturing, mining, agricultural, and mercantile\r\nindustries and the consequent distress of our laboring population. Now\r\nevery avenue of production is crowded with activity, labor is well\r\nemployed, and American products find good markets at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nOur diversified productions, however, are increasing in such\r\nunprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further\r\nenlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations. For this\r\npurpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations should in\r\nliberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted.\r\n\r\nThe national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed.\r\nWhatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with\r\nundiminished force upon the Executive and the Congress. But fortunate as\r\nour condition is, its permanence can only be assured by sound business\r\nmethods and strict economy in national administration and legislation.\r\nWe should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless\r\nventures in business or profligacy in public expenditures. While the\r\nCongress determines the objects and the sum of appropriations, the\r\nofficials of the executive departments are responsible for honest and\r\nfaithful disbursement, and it should be their constant care to avoid\r\nwaste and extravagance.\r\n\r\nHonesty, capacity, and industry are nowhere more indispensable than in\r\npublic employment. These should be fundamental requisites to original\r\nappointment and the surest guaranties against removal.\r\n\r\nFour years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing\r\nit and without any preparation or effort at preparation for the\r\nimpending peril. I did all that in honor could be done to avert the war,\r\nbut without avail. It became inevitable; and the Congress at its first\r\nregular session, without party division, provided money in anticipation\r\nof the crisis and in preparation to meet it. It came. The result was\r\nsignally favorable to American arms and in the highest degree honorable\r\nto the Government. It imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot\r\nescape and from which it would be dishonorable to seek escape. We are\r\nnow at peace with the world, and it is my fervent prayer that if\r\ndifferences arise between us and other powers they may be settled by\r\npeaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nIntrusted by the people for a second time with the office of President,\r\nI enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities\r\nwhich attach to this renewed honor and commission, promising unreserved\r\ndevotion on my part to their faithful discharge and reverently invoking\r\nfor my guidance the direction and favor of Almighty God. I should shrink\r\nfrom the duties this day assumed if I did not feel that in their\r\nperformance I should have the co-operation of the wise and patriotic\r\nmen of all parties. It encourages me for the great task which I now\r\nundertake to believe that those who voluntarily committed to me the\r\ntrust imposed upon the Chief Executive of the Republic will give to\r\nme generous support in my duties to \"preserve, protect, and defend,\r\nthe Constitution of the United States\" and to \"care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed.\" The national purpose is indicated through a\r\nnational election. It is the constitutional method of ascertaining the\r\npublic will. When once it is registered it is a law to us all, and\r\nfaithful observance should follow its decrees.\r\n\r\nStrong hearts and helpful hands are needed, and, fortunately, we have\r\nthem in every part of our beloved country. We are reunited. Sectionalism\r\nhas disappeared. Division on public questions can no longer be traced\r\nby the war maps of 1861. These old differences less and less disturb\r\nthe judgment. Existing problems demand the thought and quicken the\r\nconscience of the country, and the responsibility for their presence, as\r\nwell as for their righteous settlement, rests upon us all--no more upon\r\nme than upon you. There are some national questions in the solution\r\nof which patriotism should exclude partisanship. Magnifying their\r\ndifficulties will not take them off our hands nor facilitate their\r\nadjustment. Distrust of the capacity, integrity, and high purposes of\r\nthe American people will not be an inspiring theme for future political\r\ncontests. Dark pictures and gloomy forebodings are worse than useless.\r\nThese only becloud, they do not help to point the way of safety and\r\nhonor. \"Hope maketh not ashamed.\" The prophets of evil were not the\r\nbuilders of the Republic, nor in its crises since have they saved or\r\nserved it. The faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation,\r\nand the faith of their descendants has wrought its progress and\r\nfurnished its defenders. They are obstructionists who despair, and who\r\nwould destroy confidence in the ability of our people to solve wisely\r\nand for civilization the mighty problems resting upon them. The American\r\npeople, intrenched in freedom at home, take their love for it with them\r\nwherever they go, and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine\r\nthat we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of\r\nliberty to others. Our institutions will not deteriorate by extension,\r\nand our sense of justice will not abate under tropic suns in distant\r\nseas. As heretofore, so hereafter will the nation demonstrate its\r\nfitness to administer any new estate which events devolve upon it, and\r\nin the fear of God will \"take occasion by the hand and make the bounds\r\nof freedom wider yet.\" If there are those among us who would make our\r\nway more difficult, we must not be disheartened, but the more earnestly\r\ndedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have rightly entered. The\r\npath of progress is seldom smooth. New things are often found hard to\r\ndo. Our fathers found them so. We find them so. They are inconvenient.\r\nThey cost us something. But are we not made better for the effort and\r\nsacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?\r\n\r\nWe will be consoled, too, with the fact that opposition has confronted\r\nevery onward movement of the Republic from its opening hour until now,\r\nbut without success. The Republic has marched on and on, and its step\r\nhas exalted freedom and humanity. We are undergoing the same ordeal as\r\ndid our predecessors nearly a century ago. We are following the course\r\nthey blazed. They triumphed. Will their successors falter and plead\r\norganic impotency in the nation? Surely after 125 years of achievement\r\nfor mankind we will not now surrender our equality with other powers on\r\nmatters fundamental and essential to nationality. With no such purpose\r\nwas the nation created. In no such spirit has it developed its full and\r\nindependent sovereignty. We adhere to the principle of equality among\r\nourselves, and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a\r\nsubordinate rank in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, the public events of the past four years have\r\ngone into history. They are too near to justify recital. Some of them\r\nwere unforeseen; many of them momentous and far-reaching in their\r\nconsequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of the world.\r\nThe part which the United States bore so honorably in the thrilling\r\nscenes in China, while new to American life, has been in harmony with\r\nits true spirit and best traditions, and in dealing with the results its\r\npolicy will be that of moderation and fairness.\r\n\r\nWe face at this moment a most important question--that of the future\r\nrelations of the United States and Cuba. With our near neighbors we must\r\nremain close friends. The declaration of the purposes of this Government\r\nin the resolution of April 20, 1898, must be made good. Ever since the\r\nevacuation of the island by the army of Spain the Executive, with all\r\npracticable speed, has been assisting its people in the successive steps\r\nnecessary to the establishment of a free and independent government\r\nprepared to assume and perform the obligations of international law\r\nwhich now rest upon the United States under the treaty of Paris. The\r\nconvention elected by the people to frame a constitution is approaching\r\nthe completion of its labors. The transfer of American control to the\r\nnew government is of such great importance, involving an obligation\r\nresulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace, that I am glad\r\nto be advised by the recent act of Congress of the policy which the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government deems essential to the best\r\ninterests of Cuba and the United States. The principles which led to\r\nour intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new\r\ngovernment rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of\r\nperforming the duties and discharging the functions of a separate\r\nnation, of observing its international obligations of protecting life\r\nand property, insuring order, safety, and liberty, and conforming to the\r\nestablished and historical policy of the United States in its relation\r\nto Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe peace which we are pledged to leave to the Cuban people must\r\ncarry with it the guaranties of permanence. We became sponsors for the\r\npacification of the island, and we remain accountable to the Cubans,\r\nno less than to our own country and people, for the reconstruction of\r\nCuba as a free commonwealth on abiding foundations of right, justice,\r\nliberty, and assured order. Our enfranchisement of the people will not\r\nbe completed until free Cuba shall \"be a reality, not a name; a perfect\r\nentity, not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of\r\nfailure.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the treaty of peace with Spain was ratified on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, 1899, and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago,\r\nthe Congress has indicated no form of government for the Philippine\r\nIslands. It has, however, provided an army to enable the Executive to\r\nsuppress insurrection, restore peace, give security to the inhabitants,\r\nand establish the authority of the United States throughout the\r\narchipelago. It has authorized the organization of native troops as\r\nauxiliary to the regular force. It has been advised from time to time\r\nof the acts of the military and naval officers in the islands, of my\r\naction in appointing civil commissions, of the instructions with which\r\nthey were charged, of their duties and powers, of their recommendations,\r\nand of their several acts under executive commission, together with the\r\nvery complete general information they have submitted. These reports\r\nfully set forth the conditions, past and present, in the islands, and\r\nthe instructions clearly show the principles which will guide the\r\nExecutive until the Congress shall, as it is required to do by the\r\ntreaty, determine \"the civil rights and political status of the native\r\ninhabitants.\" The Congress having added the sanction of its authority to\r\nthe powers already possessed and exercised by the Executive under the\r\nConstitution, thereby leaving with the Executive the responsibility for\r\nthe government of the Philippines, I shall continue the efforts already\r\nbegun until order shall be restored throughout the islands, and as fast\r\nas conditions permit will establish local governments, in the formation\r\nof which the full co-operation of the people has been already invited,\r\nand when established will encourage the people to administer them. The\r\nsettled purpose, long ago proclaimed, to afford the inhabitants of the\r\nislands self-government as fast as they were ready for it will be\r\npursued with earnestness and fidelity. Already something has been\r\naccomplished in this direction. The Government's representatives, civil\r\nand military, are doing faithful and noble work in their mission of\r\nemancipation and merit the approval and support of their countrymen.\r\nThe most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the\r\ninsurgents, and the way is still open for those who have raised their\r\narms against the Government for honorable submission to its authority.\r\nOur countrymen should not be deceived. We are not waging war against the\r\ninhabitants of the Philippine Islands. A portion of them are making war\r\nagainst the United States. By far the greater part of the inhabitants\r\nrecognize American sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and\r\nof security for life, property, liberty, freedom of conscience, and the\r\npursuit of happiness. To them full protection will be given. They shall\r\nnot be abandoned. We will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions in\r\nthe islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States. Order under civil institutions will come as soon as those\r\nwho now break the peace shall keep it. Force will not be needed or used\r\nwhen those who make war against us shall make it no more. May it end\r\nwithout further bloodshed, and there be ushered in the reign of peace\r\nto be made permanent by a government of liberty under law!\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas public interests require that the Congress of the United States\r\nshould be convened in extra session at twelve o'clock on the 15th day of\r\nMarch, 1897, to receive such communication as may be made by the\r\nExecutive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby proclaim and declare that an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequires the Congress of the United States to convene in extra session\r\nat the Capitol in the city of Washington on the 15th day of March, 1897,\r\nat twelve o'clock, noon, of which all persons who shall at that time be\r\nentitled to act as members thereof, are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at Washington the\r\n6th day of March in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\nninety-seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one\r\nhundred and twenty-first.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN SHERMAN,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nTHANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nIn remembrance of God's goodness to us during the past year, which has\r\nbeen so abundant, \"let us offer unto Him our thanksgiving and pay our\r\nvows unto the Most High.\" Under His watchful providence industry has\r\nprospered, the conditions of labor have been improved, the rewards of\r\nthe husbandman have been increased, and the comforts of our homes\r\nmultiplied. His mighty hand has preserved peace and protected the\r\nnation.

the United States authorizing the party of the\r\nsecond part to construct and operate a submarine cable line between the\r\nUnited States and the Hawaiian Islands shall construct, lay in proper\r\nworking order, and establish a submarine telegraph cable from a point or\r\npoints on the Pacific coast of the United States to a landing place or\r\nplaces in the Hawaiian Islands with terminus at Honolulu, Island of\r\nOahu, according to the specifications of said Indenture, and further,\r\nwithin three years from the approval of such act by the Congress of the\r\nUnited States,

This honored\r\nobservance acquires with time a tenderer significance. It enriches\r\ndomestic life. It summons under the family roof the absent children to\r\nglad reunion with those they love.\r\n\r\nSeldom has this nation had greater cause for profound thanksgiving. No\r\ngreat pestilence has invaded our Shores. Liberal employment waits upon\r\nlabor. Abundant crops have rewarded the efforts of the husbandmen.\r\nIncreased comforts have come to the home. The national finances have\r\nbeen strengthened, and public credit has been sustained and made firmer.\r\nIn all branches of industry and trade there has been an unequaled degree\r\nof prosperity, while there has been a steady gain in the moral and\r\neducational growth of our national character. Churches and schools have\r\nflourished. American patriotism has been exalted. Those engaged in\r\nmaintaining the honor of the flag with such signal success have been in\r\na large degree spared from disaster and disease. An honorable peace has\r\nbeen ratified with a foreign nation with which we were at war, and we\r\nare now on friendly relations with every power of earth.\r\n\r\nThe trust which we have assumed for the benefit of the people of Cuba\r\nhas been faithfully advanced. There is marked progress toward the\r\nrestoration of healthy industrial conditions, and under wise sanitary\r\nregulations the island has enjoyed unusual exemption from the scourge of\r\nfever. The hurricane which swept over our new possession of Puerto Rico,\r\ndestroying the homes and property of the inhabitants, called forth the\r\ninstant sympathy of the people of the United States, who were swift to\r\nrespond with generous aid to the sufferers. While the insurrection still\r\ncontinues in the island of Luzon, business is resuming its activity, and\r\nconfidence in the good purposes of the United States is being rapidly\r\nestablished throughout the archipelago.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and countless others, I, William McKinley, President\r\nof the United States, do hereby name Thursday, the thirtieth day of\r\nNovember next, as a day of general thanksgiving and prayer, to be\r\nobserved as such by all our people on this continent and in our newly\r\nacquired islands, as well as those who may be at sea or sojourning in\r\nforeign lands; and I advise that on this day religious exercises shall\r\nbe conducted in the churches or meeting-places of all denominations, in\r\norder that in the social features of the day its real significance may\r\nnot be lost sight of, but fervent prayers may be offered to the Most\r\nHigh for a continuance of the Divine Guidance without which man's\r\nefforts are vain, and for Divine consolation to those whose kindred and\r\nfriends have sacrificed their lives for country.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that on this day so far as may be found practicable\r\nlabor shall cease from its accustomed toil and charity abound toward the\r\nsick, the needy and the poor.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have set my hand and caused the seal of the United\r\nStates to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this 25th day of October, A.D. 1899, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-fourth.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by joint resolution \"to provide for annexing the Hawaiian\r\nIslands to the United States,\" approved July 7, 1898, the cession by the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Hawaii to the United States of America, of\r\nall rights of sovereignty of whatsoever kind in and over the Hawaiian\r\nIslands and their dependencies, and the transfer to the United States\r\nof the absolute fee and ownership of all public, Government, or\r\ncrown lands, public buildings, or edifices, ports, harbors, military\r\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and description\r\nbelonging to the Government of the Hawaiian Islands, was duly accepted,\r\nratified, and confirmed, and the said Hawaiian Islands and their\r\ndependencies annexed as a part of the territory of the United States and\r\nmade subject to the sovereign dominion thereof, and all and singular the\r\nproperty and rights hereinbefore mentioned vested in the United States\r\nof America; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it was further provided in said resolution that the existing\r\nlaws of the United States relative to public lands shall not apply to\r\nsuch lands in the Hawaiian Islands, but the Congress of the United\r\nStates shall enact special laws for their management and disposition;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas it is deemed necessary in the public interests that certain lots\r\nand plats of land in the city of Honolulu be immediately reserved for\r\nnaval purposes;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, by\r\nvirtue of the authority in me vested, do hereby declare, proclaim, and\r\nmake known that the following described lots or plats of land be and the\r\nsame are hereby, subject to such legislative action as the Congress of\r\nthe United States may take with respect thereto, reserved for naval\r\npurposes, to wit:\r\n\r\n  1st.

The story of his public life and\r\nservices is as it were the history of the country for half a century.\r\nIn the Congress of the United States he ranked among the foremost in the\r\nHouse, and later in the Senate. He was twice a member of the Executive\r\nCabinet, first as Secretary of the Treasury, and afterwards as Secretary\r\nof State. Whether in debate during the dark hours of our civil war,\r\nor as the director of the country's finances during the period of\r\nrehabilitation, or as a trusted councilor in framing the nation's laws\r\nfor over forty years, or as the exponent of its foreign policy, his\r\ncourse was ever marked by devotion to the best interests of his beloved\r\nland, and by able and conscientious effort to uphold its dignity and\r\nhonor. His countrymen will long revere his memory and see in him a type\r\nof the patriotism, the uprightness and the zeal that go to molding and\r\nstrengthening a nation.\r\n\r\nIn fitting expression of the sense of bereavement that afflicts the\r\nRepublic, I direct that on the day of the funeral the Executive Offices\r\nof the United States display the national flag at half mast and that the\r\nRepresentatives of the United States in foreign countries shall pay in\r\nlike manner appropriate tribute to the illustrious dead for a period of\r\nten days.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 22d day of October, A.D. 1900, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-fifth.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to bring our nation in safety and honor\r\nthrough another year. The works of religion and charity have everywhere\r\nbeen manifest. Our country through all its extent has been blessed with\r\nabundant harvests. Labor and the great industries of the people have\r\nprospered beyond all precedent. Our commerce has spread over the world.\r\nOur power and influence in the cause of freedom and enlightenment\r\nhave extended over distant seas and lands. The lives of our official\r\nrepresentatives and many of our people in China have been marvelously\r\npreserved. We have been generally exempt from pestilence and other great\r\ncalamities; and even the tragic visitation which overwhelmed the city of\r\nGalveston made evident the sentiments of sympathy and Christian charity\r\nby virtue of which we are one united people.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby appoint and set apart Thursday, the 20th of November next, to\r\nbe observed by all the people of the United States, at home or abroad,\r\nas a day of thanksgiving and praise to Him who holds the nations in the\r\nhollow of His hand. I recommend that they gather in their several places\r\nof worship and devoutly give Him thanks for the prosperity wherewith He\r\nhas endowed us, for seed-time and harvest, for the valor, devotion and\r\nhumanity of our armies and navies, and for all His benefits to us as\r\nindividuals and as a nation; and that they humbly pray for the\r\ncontinuance of His Divine favor, for concord and amity with other\r\nnations, and for righteousness and peace in all our ways.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this 29th day of October, A.D. 1900, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-fifth.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas public interests require that the Senate of the United States be\r\nconvened at 12 o'clock on the 4th day of March next, to receive such\r\ncommunications as may be made by the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby proclaim and declare that an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequires the Senate of the United States to convene at the Capitol in\r\nthe city of Washington on the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock noon,\r\nof which all persons who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 23d day of February, A.D. 1901, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the one hundred and twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 14, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the People of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison, President of the United States from 1889 to 1893,\r\ndied yesterday at 4:45 P.M., at his home in Indianapolis. In his death\r\nthe country has been deprived of one of its greatest citizens. A\r\nbrilliant soldier in his young manhood, he gained fame and rapid\r\nadvancement by his energy and valor. As a lawyer he rose to be a leader\r\nof the bar. In the Senate he at once took and retained high rank as an\r\norator and legislator; and in the high office of President he displayed\r\nextraordinary gifts as administrator and statesman. In public and in\r\nprivate life he set a shining example for his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn testimony of the respect in which his memory is held by the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States, I do hereby direct that the\r\nflags on the Executive Mansion and the several Departmental buildings be\r\ndisplayed at half staff for a period of thirty days;

ceded by them;\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, in pursuance of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1901\r\n(31 Stat., 1093), the Secretary of the Interior has regularly subdivided\r\nthe lands so as aforesaid respectively ceded to the United States by the\r\nWichita and affiliated bands of Indians and the Comanche, Kiowa, and\r\nApache tribes of Indians into counties, attaching portions thereof to\r\nadjoining counties in the Territory of Oklahoma, has regularly\r\ndesignated the place for the county seat of each new county, has\r\nregularly set aside and reserved at such county seat land for a townsite\r\nto be disposed of in the manner provided by the act of Congress last\r\nnamed, and has regularly caused to be surveyed, subdivided, and platted\r\nthe lands so set aside and reserved for disposition as such townsites;\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, by the act of Congress last named, it is provided:\r\n\r\n  The lands to be opened to settlement and entry under the acts of\r\n  Congress ratifying said agreements respectively shall be so opened by\r\n  proclamation of the President, and to avoid the contests and conflicting\r\n  claims which have heretofore resulted from opening

thereto under the acts ratifying said\r\n  agreements, respectively; and no person shall be permitted to settle\r\n  upon, occupy, or enter any of said lands except as prescribed in such\r\n  proclamation until after the expiration of sixty days from the time when\r\n  the same are opened to settlement and entry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, by the act of Congress last named the President was\r\nauthorized to establish two additional United States land districts and\r\nland offices in the Territory of Oklahoma to include the lands so ceded\r\nas aforesaid, which land districts and land offices have been\r\nestablished by an order of even date herewith;\r\n\r\nAnd whereas all of the conditions required by law to be performed prior\r\nto the opening of said tracts of land to settlement and entry have been,\r\nas I hereby declare, duly performed;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, by virtue of the power vested in me by law, do hereby declare\r\nand make known that all of the lands so as aforesaid ceded by the\r\nWichita and affiliated bands of Indians, and the Comanche, Kiowa, and\r\nApache tribes of Indians, respectively, saving and excepting sections\r\nsixteen, thirty-six, thirteen, and thirty-three in each township, and\r\nall lands located or selected by the Territory of Oklahoma as indemnity\r\nschool or educational lands, and saving and excepting all lands allotted\r\nin severalty to individual Indians, and saving and excepting all lands\r\nallotted and confirmed to religious societies and other organizations,\r\nand saving and excepting the lands selected and set aside as grazing\r\nlands for the use in common for said Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes\r\nof Indians, and saving and excepting the lands set aside and reserved at\r\neach of said county seats for disposition as townsites, and saving and\r\nexcepting the lands now used, occupied, or set apart for military,\r\nagency, school, school farm, religious, Indian cemetery, wood reserve,\r\nforest reserve, or other public uses, will, on the 6th day of August,\r\n1901, at 9 o'clock A.M., in the manner herein prescribed and not\r\notherwise, be opened to entry and settlement and to disposition under\r\nthe general provisions of the homestead and townsite laws of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCommencing at 9 o'clock A.M., Wednesday, July 10, 1901, and ending at\r\n6 o'clock P.M., Friday, July 26, 1901, a registration will be had at\r\nthe United States land offices at El Reno and Lawton, in the Territory\r\nof Oklahoma (the office at Lawton to occupy provisional quarters\r\nin the immediate vicinity of Fort Sill, Oklahoma Territory, until\r\nsuitable quarters can be provided at Lawton), for the purpose of\r\nascertaining what persons desire to enter, settle upon, and acquire\r\ntitle to any of said lands under the homestead law and of ascertaining\r\ntheir qualifications so to do. The registration at each office will be\r\nfor both land districts, but at the time of registration each applicant\r\nwill be required to elect and state in which district he desires to make\r\nentry. To obtain registration each applicant will be required to show\r\nhimself duly qualified to make homestead entry of these lands under\r\nexisting laws and to give the registering officer such appropriate\r\nmatters of description and identity as will protect the applicant and\r\nthe government against any attempted impersonation. Registration cannot\r\nbe effected through the use of the mails or the employment of an agent,\r\nexcepting that honorably discharged soldiers and sailors entitled to the\r\nbenefits of section 2304 of the Revised Statutes of the United States,\r\nas amended by the act of Congress approved March 1, 1901 (31 Stat.,\r\n847), may present their applications for registration and due proofs of\r\ntheir qualifications through an agent of their own selection, but no\r\nperson will be permitted to act as agent for more than one such soldier\r\nor sailor. No person will be permitted to register more than once or\r\nin any other than his true name. Each applicant who shows himself duly\r\nqualified will be registered and given a non-transferable certificate\r\nto that effect, which will entitle him to go upon and examine the lands\r\nto be opened hereunder in the land district in which he elects to make\r\nhis entry; but the only purpose for which he may go upon and examine\r\nsaid lands is that of enabling him later on, as herein provided, to\r\nunderstandingly select the lands for which he will make entry. No one\r\nwill be permitted to make settlement upon any of said lands in advance\r\nof the opening herein provided for, and during the first sixty days\r\nfollowing said opening no one but registered applicants will be\r\npermitted to make homestead settlement upon any of said lands, and then\r\nonly in pursuance of a homestead entry duly allowed by the local land\r\nofficers or of a soldier's declaratory statement duly accepted by such\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe order in which, during the first sixty days following the opening,\r\nthe registered applicants will be permitted to make homestead entry of\r\nthe lands opened hereunder, will be determined by drawings for both the\r\nEl Reno and Lawton districts publicly held at the United States land\r\noffice at El Reno, Oklahoma, commencing at 9 o'clock A.M., Monday, July\r\n29, 1901, and continuing for such period as may be necessary to complete\r\nthe same. The drawings will be had under the supervision and immediate\r\nobservation of a committee of three persons whose integrity is such as\r\nto make their control of the drawing a guaranty of its fairness. The\r\nmembers of this committee will be appointed by the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, who will prescribe suitable compensation for their services.\r\nPreparatory to these drawings the registration officers will, at the\r\ntime of registering each applicant who shows himself duly qualified,\r\nmake out a card, which must be signed by the applicant, stating the land\r\ndistrict in which he desires to make homestead entry, and giving such a\r\ndescription of the applicant as will enable the local land officers to\r\nthereafter identify him. This card will be at once sealed in a separate\r\nenvelope, which will bear no other distinguishing label or mark than\r\nsuch as may be necessary to show that it is to go into the drawing for\r\nthe land district in which the applicant desires to make entry. These\r\nenvelopes will be separated according to land districts and will be\r\ncarefully preserved and remain sealed until opened in the course of the\r\ndrawing as herein provided. When the registration is completed all of\r\nthese sealed envelopes will be brought together at the place of drawing\r\nand turned over to the committee in charge of the drawing, who, in such\r\nmanner as in their judgment will be attended with entire fairness and\r\nequality of opportunity, shall proceed to draw out and open the separate\r\nenvelopes and to give to each enclosed card a number in the order in\r\nwhich the envelope containing the same is drawn. While the drawings for\r\nthe two districts will be separately conducted they will occur as nearly\r\nat the same time as is practicable. The result of the drawing for each\r\ndistrict will be certified by the committee to the officers of the\r\ndistrict and will determine the order in which the applicants may make\r\nhomestead entry of said lands and settlement thereon.\r\n\r\nNotice of the drawings stating the name of each applicant and number\r\nassigned to him by the drawing will be posted each day at the place\r\nof drawing, and each applicant will be notified of his number by a\r\npostal-card mailed to him at the address, if any, given by him at the\r\ntime of registration. Each applicant should, however, in his own behalf\r\nemploy such measures as will insure his obtaining prompt and accurate\r\ninformation of the order in which his application for homestead entry\r\ncan be presented as fixed by the drawing. Applications for homestead\r\nentry of said lands during the first sixty days following the opening\r\ncan be made only by registered applicants and in the order established\r\nby the drawing. At each land office, commencing Tuesday, August 6, 1901,\r\nat 9 o'clock A.M., the applications of those drawing numbers 1 to 125,\r\ninclusive, for that district must be presented and will be considered\r\nin their numerical order during the first day, and the applications\r\nof those drawing numbers 126 to 250, inclusive, must be presented and\r\nwill be considered in their numerical order during the second day,\r\nand so on at that rate until all of said lands subject to entry under\r\nthe homestead law, and desired thereunder, have been entered. If any\r\napplicant fails to appear and present his application for entry when the\r\nnumber assigned to him by the drawing is reached, his right to enter\r\nwill be passed until after the other applications assigned for that day\r\nhave been disposed of, when he will be given another opportunity to make\r\nentry, failing in which he will be deemed to have abandoned his right to\r\nmake entry under such drawing. To obtain the allowance of a homestead\r\nentry each applicant must personally present the certificate of\r\nregistration theretofore issued to him, together with a regular\r\nhomestead application and the necessary accompanying proofs, and with\r\nthe regular land office fees, but an honorably discharged soldier or\r\nsailor may file his declaratory statement through the agent representing\r\nhim at the registration. The production of the certificate of\r\nregistration will be dispensed with only upon satisfactory proof of\r\nits loss or destruction. If at the time of considering his regular\r\napplication for entry it appears that any applicant is disqualified from\r\nmaking homestead entry of these lands his application will be rejected,\r\nnotwithstanding his prior registration. If any applicant shall register\r\nmore than once hereunder, or in any other than his true name, or shall\r\ntransfer his registration certificate he will thereby lose all the\r\nbenefits of the registration and drawing herein provided for, and will\r\nbe precluded from entering or settling upon any of said lands during the\r\nfirst sixty days following said opening.\r\n\r\nBecause of the provision in the said act of Congress approved June 6,\r\n1900: \"That the settlers who located on that part of said lands called\r\nand known as the 'neutral strip' shall have preference right for thirty\r\ndays on the lands upon which they have located and improved,\" the said\r\nlands in the \"neutral strip\" shall for the period of thirty days after\r\nsaid opening be subject to homestead entry and townsite entry only by\r\nthose who have heretofore located upon and improved the same, and who\r\nare accorded a preference right of entry for thirty days as aforesaid.\r\nPersons entitled to make entry under this preference right will be\r\npermitted to do so at any time during said period of thirty days\r\nfollowing the opening without previous registration, and without regard\r\nto the drawing herein provided for, and at the expiration of that period\r\nthe lands in said \"neutral strip\" for which no entry shall have been\r\nmade will come under the general provisions of this proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe intended beneficiaries of the provision in the said acts of\r\nCongress, approved, respectively, March 2, 1895, and June 6, 1900, which\r\nauthorizes a qualified entryman having lands adjoining the ceded lands,\r\nwhose original entry embraced less than 160 acres, to enter so much\r\nof the ceded lands as will make his homestead entry contain in the\r\naggregate not exceeding 160 acres, may obtain such an extension of his\r\nexisting entry, without previous registration and without regard to the\r\ndrawing herein provided for, only by making appropriate application,\r\naccompanied by the necessary proofs, at the proper new land office at\r\nsome time prior to the opening herein provided for.\r\n\r\nAny person or persons desiring to found, or to suggest establishing\r\na townsite upon any of said ceded lands at any point not in the near\r\nvicinity of either of the county seats therein heretofore selected and\r\ndesignated as aforesaid, may, at any time before the opening herein\r\nprovided for, file in the proper local land office a written application\r\nto that effect describing by legal subdivisions the lands intended to be\r\naffected, and stating fully and under oath the necessity or propriety of\r\nfounding or establishing a town at that place. The local officers will\r\nforthwith transmit said petition to the Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice with their recommendation in the premises. Such Commissioner, if\r\nhe believes the public interests will be subserved thereby, will, if the\r\nSecretary of the Interior approve thereof, issue an order withdrawing\r\nthe lands described in such petition, or any portion thereof, from\r\nhomestead entry and settlement and directing that the same be held for\r\nthe time being for townsite settlement, entry, and disposition only.\r\nIn such event the lands so withheld from homestead entry and settlement\r\nwill, at the time of said opening and not before, become subject to\r\nsettlement, entry, and disposition under the general townsite laws\r\nof the United States. None of said ceded lands will be subject to\r\nsettlement, entry, or disposition under such general townsite laws\r\nexcept in the manner herein prescribed until after the expiration of\r\nsixty days from the time of said opening.\r\n\r\nAttention is hereby especially called to the fact that under the special\r\nprovisions of the said act of Congress approved March 3, 1901, the\r\ntownsites selected and designated at the county seats of the new\r\ncounties into which said lands have been formed cannot be disposed of\r\nunder the general townsite laws of the United States, and can only be\r\ndisposed of in the special manner provided in said act of Congress,\r\nwhich declares:\r\n\r\n  The lands so set apart and designated shall, in advance of the opening,\r\n  be surveyed, subdivided, and platted, under the direction of the\r\n  Secretary of the Interior, into appropriate lots, blocks, streets,\r\n  alleys, and sites for parks or public buildings, so as to make a\r\n  townsite thereof: _Provided_, That no person shall purchase more than\r\n  one business and one residence lot. Such town lots shall be offered\r\n  and sold at public auction to the highest bidder, under the direction\r\n  of the Secretary of the Interior, at sales to be had at the opening\r\n  and subsequent thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll persons are especially admonished that under the said act of\r\nCongress approved March 3, 1901, it is provided that no person shall\r\nbe permitted to settle upon, occupy, or enter any of said ceded lands\r\nexcept in the manner prescribed in this proclamation until after the\r\nexpiration of sixty days from the time when the same are opened to\r\nsettlement and entry. After the expiration of the said period of sixty\r\ndays, but not before, any of said lands remaining undisposed of may be\r\nsettled upon, occupied and entered under the general provisions of the\r\nhomestead and townsite laws of the United States in like manner as if\r\nthe manner of effecting such settlement, occupancy and entry had not\r\nbeen prescribed herein in obedience to law.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that there are fences around the pastures into which, for\r\nconvenience, portions of the ceded lands have heretofore been divided,\r\nand that these fences are of considerable value and are still the\r\nproperty of the Indian tribes ceding said lands to the United States,\r\nall persons going upon examining, entering or settling upon any of\r\nsaid lands are cautioned to respect such fences as the property of the\r\nIndians and not to destroy, appropriate, or carry away the same, but\r\nto leave them undisturbed so that they may be seasonably removed and\r\npreserved for the benefit of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall prescribe all needful rules and\r\nregulations necessary to carry into full effect the opening herein\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this 4th day of July, A.D. 1901, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-sixth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  DAVID J.

laws, and for other purposes,\"\r\nwhich provides, \"That the President of the United States may, from time\r\nto time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public\r\nlands bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part\r\ncovered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not,\r\nas public reservations, and the President shall, by public

To-day\r\nI have additional satisfaction in meeting and giving welcome to the\r\nforeign representatives assembled here, whose presence and participation\r\nin this exposition have contributed in so marked a degree to its\r\ninterest and success. To the Commissioners of the Dominion of Canada and\r\nthe British colonies, the French colonies, the republics of Mexico and\r\nCentral and South America and the commissioners of Cuba and Puerto Rico,\r\nwho share with us in this undertaking, we give the hand of fellowship\r\nand felicitate with them upon the triumphs of art, science, education\r\nand manufacture which the old has bequeathed to the new century.\r\nExpositions are the timekeepers of progress. They record the world's\r\nadvancement. They stimulate the energy, enterprise and intellect of the\r\npeople and quicken human genius. They go into the home. They broaden and\r\nbrighten the daily life of the people. They open mighty storehouses of\r\ninformation to the student. Every exposition, great or small, has helped\r\nto some onward step. Comparison of ideas is always educational, and\r\nas such instruct the brain and hand of man. Friendly rivalry follows,\r\nwhich is the spur to industrial improvement, the inspiration to useful\r\ninvention and to high endeavor in all departments of human activity.\r\nIt exacts a study of the wants, comforts and even the whims of the\r\npeople and recognizes the efficiency of high quality and new pieces to\r\nwin their favor. The quest for trade is an incentive to men of business\r\nto devise, invent, improve and economize in the cost of production.\r\n\r\nBusiness life, whether among ourselves or with other people, is ever a\r\nsharp struggle for success. It will be none the less so in the future.\r\nWithout competition we would be clinging to the clumsy antiquated\r\nprocesses of farming and manufacture and the methods of business of long\r\nago, and the twentieth would be no further advanced than the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But though commercial competitors we are, commercial enemies we\r\nmust not be.\r\n\r\nThe Pan-American exposition has done its work thoroughly, presenting\r\nin its exhibits evidences of the highest skill and illustrating the\r\nprogress of the human family in the western hemisphere. This portion of\r\nthe earth has no cause for humiliation for the part it has performed in\r\nthe march of civilization. It has not accomplished everything from it.\r\nIt has simply done its best, and without vanity or boastfulness, and\r\nrecognizing the manifold achievements of others, it invites the friendly\r\nrivalry of all the powers in the peaceful pursuits of trade and\r\ncommerce, and will co-operate with all in advancing the highest and best\r\ninterests of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom and energy of all the nations are none too great for the\r\nworld's work. The success of art, science, industry and invention is an\r\ninternational asset and a common glory.\r\n\r\nAfter all, how near one to the other is every part of the world. Modern\r\ninventions have brought into close relation widely separated peoples and\r\nmade them better acquainted. Geographic and political divisions will\r\ncontinue to exist, but distances have been effaced. Swift ships and\r\nswift trains are becoming cosmopolitan. They invade fields which a few\r\nyears ago were impenetrable. The world's products are exchanged as never\r\nbefore, and with increasing transportation facilities come increasing\r\nknowledge and larger trade. Prices are fixed with mathematical precision\r\nby supply and demand. The world's selling prices are regulated by market\r\nand crop reports.\r\n\r\nWe travel greater distances in a shorter space of time and with more\r\nease than was ever dreamed of by the fathers. Isolation is no longer\r\npossible or desirable. The same important news is read, though in\r\ndifferent languages, the same day in all Christendom. The telegraph\r\nkeeps us advised of what is occurring everywhere, and the press\r\nforeshadows, with more or less accuracy, the plans and purposes of the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMarket prices of products and of securities are hourly known in every\r\ncommercial mart, and the investments of the people extend beyond their\r\nown national boundaries into the remotest parts of the earth. Vast\r\ntransactions are conducted and international exchanges are made by the\r\ntick of the cable. Every event of interest is immediately bulletined.\r\nThe quick gathering and transmission of news, like rapid transit, are of\r\nrecent origin and are only made possible by the genius of the inventor\r\nand the courage of the investor. It took a special messenger of the\r\nGovernment, with every facility known at the time for rapid travel,\r\nnineteen days to go from the city of Washington to New Orleans with a\r\nmessage to General Jackson that the war with England had ceased and a\r\ntreaty of peace had been signed. How different now!\r\n\r\nWe reached General Miles in Puerto Rico by cable, and he was able,\r\nthrough the military telegraph, to stop his army on the firing line with\r\nthe message that the United States and Spain had signed a protocol\r\nsuspending hostilities. We knew almost instantly of the first shots\r\nfired at Santiago, and the subsequent surrender of the Spanish forces\r\nwas known at Washington within less than an hour of its consummation.\r\nThe first ship of Cervera's fleet had hardly emerged from that historic\r\nharbor when the fact was flashed to our capital, and the swift\r\ndestruction that followed was announced immediately through the\r\nwonderful medium of telegraphy.\r\n\r\nSo accustomed are we to safe and easy communication with distant lands\r\nthat its temporary interruption, even in ordinary times, results in loss\r\nand inconvenience. We shall never forget the days of anxious waiting and\r\nawful suspense when no information was permitted to be sent from Pekin,\r\nand the diplomatic representatives of the nations in China, cut off\r\nfrom all communication, inside and outside of the walled capital, were\r\nsurrounded by an angry and misguided mob that threatened their lives;\r\nnor the joy that filled the world when a single message from the\r\nGovernment of the United States brought through our minister the first\r\nnews of the safety of the besieged diplomats.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century there was not a mile of steam\r\nrailroad on the globe. Now there are enough miles to make its circuit\r\nmany times. Then there was not a line of electric telegraph; now we have\r\na vast mileage traversing all lands and seas. God and man have linked\r\nthe nations together. No nation can longer be indifferent to any other.\r\nAnd as we are brought more and more in touch with each other the less\r\noccasion there is for misunderstandings and the stronger the\r\ndisposition, when we have differences, to adjust them in the court of\r\narbitration, which is the noblest forum for the settlement of\r\ninternational disputes.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, trade statistics indicate that this country is\r\nin a state of unexampled prosperity. The figures are almost appalling.\r\nThey show that we are utilizing our fields and forests and mines and\r\nthat we are furnishing profitable employment to the millions of\r\nworkingmen throughout the United States, bringing comfort and happiness\r\nto their homes and making it possible to lay by savings for old age\r\nand disability. That all the people are participating in this great\r\nprosperity is seen in every American community, and shown by the\r\nenormous and unprecedented deposits in our savings banks. Our duty\r\nis the care and security of these deposits, and their safe investment\r\ndemands the highest integrity and the best business capacity of those\r\nin charge of these depositories of the people's earnings.\r\n\r\nWe have a vast and intricate business, built up through years of\r\ntoil and struggle, in which every part of the country has its stake,\r\nand will not permit of either neglect or of undue selfishness. No\r\nnarrow, sordid policy will subserve it. The greatest skill and wisdom\r\non the part of the manufacturers and producers will be required to hold\r\nand increase it. Our industrial enterprises which have grown to such\r\ngreat proportions affect the homes and occupations of the people and\r\nthe welfare of the country. Our capacity to produce has developed so\r\nenormously and our products have so multiplied that the problem of more\r\nmarkets requires our urgent and immediate attention. Only a broad and\r\nenlightened policy will keep what we have. No other policy will get\r\nmore. In these times of marvelous business energy and gain we ought\r\nto be looking to the future, strengthening the weak places in our\r\nindustrial and commercial system, that we may be ready for any storm\r\nor strain.\r\n\r\nBy sensible trade arrangements which will not interrupt our home\r\nproduction we shall extend the outlets for our increasing surplus.\r\nA system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities, a mutual\r\nexchange is manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth\r\nof our export trade. We must not repose in fancied security that we can\r\nforever sell everything and buy little or nothing. If such a thing were\r\npossible, it would not be best for us or for those with whom we deal.\r\nWe should take from our customers such of their products as we can use\r\nwithout harm to our industries and labor. Reciprocity is the natural\r\noutgrowth of our wonderful industrial development under the domestic\r\npolicy now firmly established. What we produce beyond our domestic\r\nconsumption must have a vent abroad. The excess must be relieved through\r\na foreign outlet and we should sell everywhere we can, and buy wherever\r\nthe buying will enlarge our sales and productions, and thereby make a\r\ngreater demand for home labor.\r\n\r\nThe period of exclusiveness is past. The expansion of our trade and\r\ncommerce is the pressing problem. Commercial wars are unprofitable.\r\nA policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent\r\nreprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the\r\ntimes, measures of retaliation are not. If perchance some of our tariffs\r\nare no longer needed, for revenue or to encourage and protect our\r\nindustries at home, why should they not be employed to extend and\r\npromote our markets abroad? Then, too, we have inadequate steamship\r\nservice. New lines of steamers have already been put in commission\r\nbetween the Pacific coast ports of the United States and those on the\r\nwestern coasts of Mexico and Central and South America. These should be\r\nfollowed up with direct steamship lines between the eastern coast of the\r\nUnited States and South American ports. One of the needs of the times is\r\nto direct commercial lines from our vast fields of production to the\r\nfields of consumption that we have but barely touched. Next in advantage\r\nto having the thing to sell is to have the convenience to carry it to\r\nthe buyer. We must encourage our merchant marine. We must have more\r\nships. They must be under the American flag, built and manned and owned\r\nby Americans. These will not only be profitable in a commercial sense;\r\nthey will be messengers of peace and amity wherever they go. We must\r\nbuild the Isthmian canal, which will unite the two oceans and give a\r\nstraight line of water communication with the western coasts of Central\r\nand South America and Mexico. The construction of a Pacific cable cannot\r\nbe longer postponed.\r\n\r\nIn the furthering of these objects of national interest and concern\r\nyou are performing an important part. This exposition would have\r\ntouched the heart of that American statesman whose mind was ever alert\r\nand thought ever constant for a larger commerce and a truer fraternity\r\nof the republics of the new world. His broad American spirit is felt\r\nand manifested here. He needs no identification to an assemblage of\r\nAmericans anywhere, for the name of Blaine is inseparably associated\r\nwith the Pan-American movement, which finds this practical and\r\nsubstantial expression, and which we all hope will be firmly advanced by\r\nthe Pan-American congress that assembles this autumn in the capital of\r\nMexico. The good work will go on. It cannot be stopped. These buildings\r\nwill disappear; this creation of art and beauty and industry will perish\r\nfrom sight, but their influence will remain to\r\n\r\n  Make it live beyond its too short living\r\n  With praises and thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho can tell the new thoughts that have been awakened, the ambitions\r\nfired and the high achievements that will be wrought through this\r\nexposition? Gentlemen, let us ever remember that our interest is in\r\nconcord, not conflict, and that our real eminence rests in the victories\r\nof peace, not those of war. We hope that all who are represented here\r\nmay be moved to higher and nobler effort for their own and the world's\r\ngood, and that out of this city may come, not only greater commerce and\r\ntrade, but more essential than these, relations of mutual respect,\r\nconfidence and friendship which will deepen and endure.\r\n\r\nOur earnest prayer is that God will graciously vouchsafe prosperity,\r\nhappiness and peace to all our neighbors, and like blessings to all the\r\npeoples and powers of earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF THE ASSASSINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffalo, N.Y., Sept. 6-7 P.M._\r\n\r\nThe President was shot about 4 o'clock. One bullet struck him on the\r\nupper portion of the breastbone, glancing and not penetrating; the\r\nsecond bullet penetrated the abdomen five inches below the left nipple\r\nand one and a half inches to the left of the median line. The abdomen\r\nwas opened through the line of the bullet wound. It was found that the\r\nbullet had penetrated the stomach. The opening in the front wall of the\r\nstomach was carefully closed with silk stitches, after which a search\r\nwas made for a hole in the back wall of the stomach. This was found and\r\nalso closed in the same way. The further course of the bullet could not\r\nbe discovered, although careful search was made. The abdominal wound was\r\nclosed without drainage. No injury to the intestines or other abdominal\r\norgan was discovered. The patient stood the operation well, pulse of\r\ngood quality, rate of 130. Condition at the conclusion of operation was\r\ngratifying. The result cannot be foretold. His condition at present\r\njustifies hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nGEORGE B. CORTELYOU,\r\n  _Secretary to the President._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe official announcement of the President's death was received at the\r\nWhite House at 2:35 o'clock, September 14, 1901, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Buffalo, September 14._\r\n\r\n  _Col. B.F. Montgomery, Executive Mansion, Washington_:\r\n\r\n  The President died at 2:15 this morning.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE B. CORTELYOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately upon receipt of the official dispatch the following was sent\r\nto Secretary Cortelyou:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Members of the executive staff in Washington are deeply affected, and\r\n  beg to tender their profound sympathy to Mrs. McKinley.\r\n\r\n  O.F. PRUDEN,\r\n    _Assistant Secretary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF DEATH BY THE PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILBURN HOUSE, _Buffalo, N.Y., Sept. 14._\r\n\r\nThe following report of the autopsy upon the remains of President\r\nMcKinley was issued at 5 o'clock:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The bullet which struck over the breastbone did not pass through the\r\n  skin, and did little harm. The other bullet passed through both walls of\r\n  the stomach near its lower border. Both holes were found to be perfectly\r\n  closed by the stitches, but the tissue around each hole had become\r\n  gangrenous. After passing through the stomach the bullet passed into\r\n  the back walls of the abdomen, hitting and tearing the upper end of\r\n  the kidney. This portion of the bullet track was also gangrenous, the\r\n  gangrene involving the pancreas. The bullet has not yet been found.\r\n  There was no sign of peritonitis or disease of other organs. The heart\r\n  walls were very thin. There was no evidence of any attempt at repair on\r\n  the part of nature, and death resulted from the gangrene, which affected\r\n  the stomach around the bullet wounds as well as the tissues around the\r\n  further course of the bullet. Death was unavoidable by any surgical or\r\n  medical treatment, and was the direct result of the bullet wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HARVEY D. GAYLORD, M.D.\r\n  HERMAN G. MATZINGER, M.D.\r\n  P.M.

They in\r\nturn issued the necessary orders for the closing of their respective\r\ndepartments, not only in Washington, but throughout the country. In a\r\nshort time the large buildings were deserted, except by a few clerks\r\ndetailed to aid their chiefs in the promulgation of necessary orders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to issuing the order closing the Navy Department,\r\nActing Secretary Hackett dispatched the following order to every\r\ncommander-in-chief, to every navy yard, and to every United States ship,\r\nstating simply:\r\n\r\n  It is with profound sorrow that the department announces to you the\r\n  death of President McKinley at 2:15, September 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Acting Secretary also issued the following order to the naval branch\r\nof the United States:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [SPECIAL ORDER No. 12.]\r\n\r\n  NAVY DEPARTMENT, _Washington, Sept. 14, 1901._\r\n\r\n  The President of the United States died this morning at 2:15, in the\r\n  city of Buffalo, N.Y. Officers and men of the navy and Marine Corps need\r\n  not to be reminded of the public and private virtues of their late\r\n  Commander-in-Chief. The whole people loved William McKinley, for he\r\n  loved and trusted them.\r\n\r\n  As soldier, statesman, husband, and as a pure-minded, great-hearted\r\n  American, his fame now belongs to his country.\r\n\r\n  Under the Constitution, Theodore Roosevelt, previously Vice-President,\r\n  has become President and Commander-in-Chief of the navy and Marine Corps\r\n  of the United States.\r\n\r\n  F.W.

Similar orders shall be given at naval stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA naval regulation provides that salutes shall not be fired on Sunday\r\nexcept in cases wherein international courtesy would suffer from the\r\nbreach. Therefore the firing of the guns will take place on Monday at\r\nthose points where the department's announcement was received yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nA dispatch was received at the War Department on the afternoon of the\r\n13th from Secretary Root approving the draft of the order to the army,\r\nannouncing the death of President McKinley. It was sent to all officers\r\nin command. The order follows:\r\n\r\n  HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n    ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n      _Washington, September 14._\r\n\r\n  _General orders_:\r\n\r\n  1.

At dawn thirteen guns will be fired at each military post, and\r\n  afterward at intervals of thirty minutes between the rising and setting\r\n  sun a single gun, and at the close of the day the salute of the Union of\r\n  forty-five guns.\r\n\r\n  The national flag will be displayed at half-staff at the headquarters\r\n  of the several military divisions and departments, and at all military\r\n  posts, stations, forts, and buildings and vessels under the control\r\n  of the department until the remains of the late Chief Magistrate are\r\n  consigned to their final resting place at Canton, Ohio, on the afternoon\r\n  of Thursday, the 19th instant, on which day all labor will be suspended\r\n  at all military posts and stations and on all public works under the\r\n  direction of the department, and at 12 o'clock meridian twenty-one\r\n  minute guns will be fired from all military posts and stations.\r\n\r\n  The officers of the army of the United States will wear the usual badge\r\n  of mourning on their swords and the colors of the various military\r\n  organizations of the army will be draped in mourning for the period of\r\n  one month.\r\n\r\n  4. The following officers of the army will, with a like number of\r\n  officers of the navy selected for the purpose, compose the guard of\r\n  honor, and accompany the remains of their late Commander-in-Chief from\r\n  the National Capital to Canton, Ohio, and continue with them until they\r\n  are consigned to their final resting place:\r\n\r\n  The Lieutenant-General of the Army.\r\n  Maj.-Gen.

Miles.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS WARD,\r\n    _Acting Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following order then issued:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington, Sept. 14._\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of War announces to the army that upon the death of\r\n  William McKinley, President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt,\r\n  Vice-President, has succeeded to the office of President of the United\r\n  States, by virtue of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n  ELIHU ROOT,\r\n    _Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary Root also gave directions to the officers of the department to\r\nmake the necessary arrangements and issue orders for the participation\r\nof the army in the funeral ceremonies, following the Garfield precedent.\r\n\r\nThe following order was issued by the Secretary of the Treasury to the\r\nRevenue Cutter Service:\r\n\r\n  The department announces to the service the sad tidings of the death of\r\n  the President. The flags of all vessels of the Revenue Cutter Service\r\n  will be carried at half-mast until otherwise ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GAGE ANNOUNCES DEATH.\r\n\r\nHEAD OF TREASURY PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MCKINLEY.\r\n\r\nSecretary Gage issued the following announcement of the death of\r\nPresident McKinley:\r\n\r\n  It has been thought proper to make sad but official announcement in this\r\n  issue of Treasury Decisions of the tragic death of William McKinley,\r\n  twenty-fifth President of the United States, and to give some expression\r\n  of that tribute which his character and deeds compel.\r\n\r\n  It needed not the shadows of death to make the figure of the late\r\n  President loom large in the estimate of mankind.\r\n\r\n  The republic he loved he lived to broaden and unify as no previous\r\n  President had done. Under his prudent and far-seeing statesmanship it\r\n  took exalted place in the community of nations.\r\n\r\n  From his place as private citizen, on through many and increasing\r\n  honors to his final post as ruler of his people, he remained true to\r\n  the highest ideals.\r\n\r\n  By the people of the nation at large and by the world he was known and\r\n  will live in grateful annals as a gentleman of noble heart, an\r\n  affectionate husband, a sturdy friend, and a faithful and illustrious\r\n  President.\r\n\r\n  In a long public life, ever open to his fellows, nothing was ever found,\r\n  even by intemperate partisan zeal, that would cast a shade upon his\r\n  character.\r\n\r\n  The kindly and unselfish attributes which his colleagues knew and loved,\r\n  the public felt, and now men of every faith and following join in\r\n  reverent acknowledgment of those distinctive virtues and abilities that\r\n  lift him among the truly great of all ages.\r\n\r\n  The passing of Presidents and Kings usually evokes tributes of praise,\r\n  but in William McKinley's life there was an element that made him more\r\n  than ruler, and which, in the hour of his death, is above the tribute\r\n  of speech and tears.\r\n\r\n  The ordinary tributes paid to the memory of the great when they pass\r\n  from earth utterly fail to satisfy the mind in an attempted application\r\n  of them to our dead President.\r\n\r\n  L.J. GAGE,\r\n    _Secretary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATE OF THE CORONER.\r\n\r\nFORMAL RECORD OF MCKINLEY'S DEATH FOR BUREAU OF VITAL STATISTICS.\r\n\r\nThe coroner of Erie County issued the following certificate of death of\r\nthe late President:\r\n\r\n\r\n  CITY OF BUFFALO,\r\n    BUREAU OF VITAL STATISTICS,\r\n      COUNTY OF ERIE, STATE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n  Certificate and record of death of William McKinley:\r\n\r\n  I hereby certify that he died on the 14th day of September, 1901, about\r\n  2:15 o'clock A.M., and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the\r\n  cause of death was as hereunder written:\r\n\r\n  Cause, gangrene of both walls of stomach and pancreas following gunshot\r\n  wound.\r\n\r\n  Witness my hand this 14th day of September, 1901.\r\n\r\n  H.R.
