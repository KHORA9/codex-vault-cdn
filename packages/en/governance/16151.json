I.--JUNE, 1862.--No. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CONSTITUTION AND SLAVERY._\r\n\r\nThere are two sections of the United States, the Free States and the\r\nSlave States, who hold views widely different upon the subject of\r\nSlavery and the true interpretation of the Constitution in relation to\r\nit. The Southern view, for the most part, is:\r\n\r\n1. The Constitution recognizes slaves as strictly property, to her\r\nbought and sold as merchandise.\r\n\r\n2. The Constitution recognizes all the territories as open to slavery as\r\nmuch as to freedom, except in those cases where it has been expressly\r\ninterdicted by the Federal Government; and it secures the legal right to\r\ncarry slaves into the territories, and any act of Congress, restricting\r\nthis right to hold slaves in the territories, is unconstitutional and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\n3. Slavery is a natural institution, and not to be considered as local\r\nand municipal.\r\n\r\n4. The Constitution is simply a compact or league between sovereign\r\nStates, and when either party breaks, in the estimation of the other,\r\nthis contract, it is no longer binding upon the whole, and the party\r\nthat thinks itself wronged has a right, acting according to its own\r\njudgment, to leave the Union.\r\n\r\n5. This contract between sovereign States has been broken to such an\r\nextent, by long and repeated aggressions upon the South by the North,\r\nthat the slave States who have seceded from the Union, or who may\r\nsecede, are not only right in thus doing, but are justified in taking up\r\narms, to prevent the collection of revenue by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are universally repudiated in the free States. It is not my\r\npurpose to discuss the social or moral relations of slavery, but simply\r\nto consider under what circumstances the Constitution originated, and\r\nwhat was the clear intent of those who adopted it as the organic or\r\nfundamental law of the country. The last assumption taken by the\r\nseceding States grows out of the first four, and therefore it becomes a\r\nquestion of vital interest, what did the framers of the Constitution\r\nmean? We must remember that while names remain the same, the things\r\nwhich they represent in time go through a radical change. Slavery is not\r\nthe same that it was when the Constitution was formed, nor are the\r\noriginal slave States the same. If freedom at the North has made great\r\nstrides, so also has slavery South. Our country now witnesses a mighty\r\ndifference in free and slave institutions from what originally was seen.\r\nThe stand-point of slavery and freedom has altogether changed, not from\r\nlocal legislation, but from natural causes, inherent in these two\r\ndiverse states of society. New interests, new relations, new views of\r\ncommerce, agriculture, and manufactures now characterize our country. It\r\nwill not do then to infer, from the existing state of things, what was\r\noriginally the respective condition of the slaveholding and the free\r\nStates, or what was in fact the import of that agreement, called the\r\nConstitution, which brought about the Federal Union. The framers of the\r\nConstitution did not reason so much as to what they should do for\r\nposterity as for the generation then living. As fallible men, much as\r\nthey would wish to legislate wisely for the future, yet their very\r\nimperfection of knowledge precluded them from knowing fully what fifty\r\nor a hundred years hence would be the development of slavery or freedom.\r\nTheir actions must have reference to present wants, and consult\r\nespecially existing conditions of society. While they intended that the\r\nConstitution should be the supreme law of the land, yet they wisely put\r\ninto the hands of the people the power of amending it at any such time\r\nas circumstances might make it necessary. The question then at issue\r\nbetween the North and the South is not what the Constitution should\r\nread, not what it ought to be, to come up to the supposed interests of\r\nthe country; but what it does read. How is the Constitution truly to be\r\ninterpreted? All parties should acquiesce in seeking only to find out\r\nthe literal import of the Constitution as originally framed, or\r\nsubsequently amended, and abide by it, irrespective altogether of\r\npresent interests or relations. The reason is, in no other way can the\r\ncommon welfare of the country be promoted. If the necessities of the\r\npeople demand a change in the Constitution, they can, in a legal way,\r\nexercise the right, always remembering that no republic, no free\r\ninstitutions, no democratic state of society can exist that denies the\r\ngreat principle of the rule of the majority. It becomes us, then, in\r\norder that we may come to a right decision respecting the duties that\r\ngrow out of our Federal Union, to consider what language the\r\nConstitution makes use of, in relation to slavery, and how was this\r\ninstrument interpreted by the framers. The great question is, was\r\nslavery regarded as a political and moral evil, to be restricted and\r\ncircumscribed within the States existing under the Constitution, or was\r\nit looked upon as a blessing, a social relation of society, proper to be\r\ndiffused over the territories? It can be clearly shown that there was no\r\nsuch state of feeling, respecting slavery, as to lead the originators of\r\nour Constitution to look upon it as a thing in itself of natural right,\r\nuseful in its operation, and worthy of enlargement and perpetuation.\r\nRather, the universal sentiment respecting slavery, North and South,\r\nwas, that as a great moral, social, and political evil, it should be\r\ncondemned, and the widely prevalent impression was, that through the\r\npeaceful operation of causes that evinced the immeasurable superiority\r\nof free institutions, slavery would itself die out, and the whole\r\ncountry be consecrated to free labor. Never did it enter the minds of\r\nthe framers of the Constitution, that slavery was a thing in itself\r\nright and desirable, or that it should be encouraged in the territories.\r\nIt was looked upon as exclusively local in its character, the creature\r\nof State law, a relation of society that was to be regulated like any\r\nother municipal institution. It is not to be presumed that the authors\r\nof our government would, in the Declaration of Independence, assert the\r\nnatural rights of all men to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness, and then contradict this cardinal principle of the revolution\r\nin the Constitution. They found slavery existing in the Southern States;\r\nthey simply left it as it was before the Revolution, with the idea that\r\nin time the local action of the State legislature would do away with the\r\nsystem. But so far as the extension of slavery was concerned, the\r\npredominant feeling, North and South, was hostile to it. The security\r\nof the country demanded the union of the States under one common\r\nConstitution. The dangers of foreign war, the exhausted finances of the\r\ndifferent States, the evils of a great public debt, contracted during\r\nthe Revolution, made it advisable, as soon as the consent of the States\r\ncould be got, to have a Constitution that should command security at\r\nhome and credit and respect abroad. It was regarded as indispensable for\r\nunion, that slavery should be left as it was found in the States. The\r\nthirteen States that first formed our Union under the Constitution, with\r\nthe great evils that grew out of war and debt, agreed, for their own\r\nmutual protection, that slavery should be permitted to exist in those\r\nStates where it was sanctioned by the local government, as an evil to be\r\ntolerated, not as a thing good in itself, to be fostered, perpetuated,\r\nand enlarged. Seeing that union could not be had without slavery, it was\r\nrecognized as an institution not to be interfered with by the free\r\nStates; but not acknowledged, in the sense that it was right, a blessing\r\nthat, like free labor, should be the normal condition of the whole\r\npeople. There was no such indifference to slavery as a civil\r\ninstitution, as has been asserted. The reason is two-fold: first, the\r\nStates could not be indifferent to slavery, if they wished; and\r\nsecondly, they could not repudiate, in the Constitution, the Declaration\r\nof Independence. Thus the word 'slave' is not found in the Constitution.\r\nIn the rendition of slaves, they simply spoke of persons held to\r\nservice, and as union was impossible, if the free States were open to\r\ntheir escape, without the right being recognized of being returned, this\r\nprovision was accordingly made; and yet by the provision that no person\r\nshould be deprived of liberty or life, without due process of law, and\r\nthat the free citizens of one State, irrespective of color, should have\r\nthe same rights, while resident in any other State, as the citizens of\r\nthat State, the framers of our Constitution declared, in language most\r\nexplicit, the natural rights of all men. The question is not as to the\r\nconsistency of their profession and practice, or how they could fight\r\nfor their own independence, and yet deny freedom, for the sake of the\r\nUnion, to the slaves; but the question is simply whether, in preparing\r\nthe Constitution, they intended to engraft upon it the idea of the\r\nnatural right of slavery, and recognize it as a blessing, to be\r\nperpetuated and enlarged. The question is simply, whether the\r\nConstitution was designed to be pro-slavery, or whether, like the\r\ninstrument of the Declaration of Independence, it was intended to be the\r\ngreat charter of civil and religious freedom, although compelled, for\r\nthe sake of union, not to interfere with slavery where it already\r\nexisted? Great stress is put upon that clause enjoining the rendition of\r\nslaves escaping from their masters; but union was impossible without\r\nthis provision. The necessity of union was thought indispensable for\r\nprotection, revenue, and securing the dearly-bought blessings of\r\nindependence. The question with them was not, ought slavery to be\r\nrecognized as a natural right, and slaves a species of property like\r\nother merchandise? but simply, shall we tolerate this evil, for the sake\r\nof Union? Thus, as the indispensable condition of union, the provision\r\nwas made for the rendition of persons held to labor in the slave States.\r\nWhy is the language of the Constitution so guarded as not to have even\r\nthe word 'slave' in it, and yet of such a character as not to interfere\r\nwith local State legislation upon slavery? Simply to steer between the\r\nCharybdis of no union and the Scylla of the repudiation of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, teaching that all men are born free and\r\nequal, and that all have natural rights, such as life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness. And yet, in the slave States, the interpretation\r\nof the Constitution is such, that the free States are accused of\r\nviolating it, unless they acknowledge that it recognizes slavery as a\r\nnatural right, and an institution to be perpetuated and enlarged, and\r\nput upon the same level with the blessing of freedom, in the\r\nterritories. Slavery virtually must be nationalized, and the\r\nConstitution be interpreted so as to carry it all over the territories\r\nnow existing, or to be acquired, or the free States have broken the\r\nConstitution, and the slave States may leave the Union whenever it suits\r\ntheir pleasure. It is easy to see how time has brought about such a\r\nrevolution of feeling and idea respecting slavery. It can be shown that\r\ncircumstances have changed altogether the relations of slavery, and\r\nwhile names have remained the same, the things which they represent have\r\nassumed a radical difference. It can be shown that the introduction of\r\nthe cotton-gin, and the increased profits of slave labor, have given an\r\nimpetus to the domestic institution that brings with it an entire\r\nrevolution of opinion. When slavery was unprofitable to the\r\nslaveholders; when, in the early days of the republic, the number of\r\nslaves was comparatively small; when, all over the country, the veterans\r\nof the Revolution existed to testify to the hardships they endured for\r\nnational independence, and eulogize even the help of the negro in\r\nsecuring it, then slavery was regarded a curse, an evil to be curtailed\r\nand in time obliterated; then the local character of slavery, as the\r\ncreature of municipal law, not to be recognized where such law does not\r\nexist, was the opinion universally of the people. But now, with the\r\ngrowing profits of slavery, with the increase of the power of this\r\ninstitution, other and far different language is held. Disguise it as we\r\nmay, there do exist great motives that have silently yet powerfully\r\noperated within the last thirty or forty years, to change the popular\r\ncurrent of feeling and opinion. Not only have the slave States held the\r\nbalance of political power, but the spread of slavery has been gigantic.\r\nThe fairest regions of the South have been opened up to the domestic\r\ninstitution, and Texas annexed, with Louisiana, Arkansas and Florida,\r\nmaking an immense area of country, to be the nursery of slavery. The\r\npolitical ascendency of the slave States has ever given to the South a\r\ngreat advantage, in the extension of their favored institution, and the\r\nresult has proved that what our ancestors looked upon as an evil that\r\ntime would soon do away with, has grown into a monster system that\r\nthreatens to make subservient to it the free institutions of the North.\r\n\r\nSlavery has now come to be a mighty energy of disquietude all over the\r\ncountry, assuming colossal proportions of mischief, and mocking all the\r\nordinary restraints of law. The question of the present day to be\r\ndecided is not whether freedom and slavery shall exist side by side, nor\r\nwhether slavery shall be tolerated as a necessary evil; but in reality,\r\nwhether freedom shall be crushed under the iron hoof of slavery, and\r\nthis institution shall obtain the complete control of the country. It\r\nhas been said that the Constitution takes the position of complete\r\nindifference to slavery; but the history of the slave States does not\r\nlead us to infer that they were ever willing that slavery should be\r\ntested by its own merits, or stand without the most persistent efforts\r\nto secure for it the patronage of the Federal Government. Study the\r\nprogress of slavery, the last forty years, and none can fail to see that\r\nit has ever aimed to secure first the supreme political control, and\r\nthen to advance its own selfish interests, at the expense of free\r\ninstitutions. The great danger has always been, that while numerically\r\nvastly inferior to the North, slavery has always been an unit, with a\r\nsingle eye to its own aggrandizement; consequently, the history of the\r\ncountry will show that so far from the general policy of the government\r\nbeing adverse to slavery, that policy has been almost exclusively upon\r\nthe side of slaveholders. The domestic institution has been ever the pet\r\ninterest of the land.\r\n\r\nIn all that pertains to political power, the slaveholding interests have\r\nbeen in the ascendant. Even when Lincoln was elected, it was found that\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives, as well as the Judiciary, were\r\nnumerically upon the side of slavery, so that he could not, even had it\r\nbeen his wish, carry out any measure inimical to the South. True, the\r\nSouth had not the same power as under Buchanan; they could not hope ever\r\nagain to wield the resources of government to secure the ascendency of\r\nslavery in Kansas; but for all that, Lincoln was powerless to encroach\r\nupon their supposed rights, even if thus disposed. Is it not, then,\r\nevident, that so far from the slaveholding States holding to the\r\nopinions of the framers of the Constitution, there has been within the\r\nlast forty years a mighty change going on in the South, giving to\r\nslavery an essentially aggressive policy, and an extension never dreamed\r\nof by the authors of the Constitution? The ground of the Constitution\r\nrespecting slavery, was simply non-interference in the States where it\r\nalready existed. It left slavery to be curtailed, or done away with by\r\nthe local legislature, but it used language the most guarded, to\r\npreclude the idea that slavery rested upon natural right, and that\r\nslaves, like other property, could be carried into the territories. It\r\nhas been said, that the position of the Constitution is that of absolute\r\nindifference, both to freedom and slavery; that it advocated neither,\r\nbut was bound to protect both. But how could the Constitution be\r\nindifferent to the very end for which it was made? Was not its great\r\ndesign to secure the liberty of the country, and promote its highest\r\nwelfare? The Constitution simply tolerated the existence of slavery, and\r\nno more. As union was impossible without the provision for the rendition\r\nof persons held to labor, escaping from one state into another, it\r\nsimply accommodated itself to an evil that was thought would be\r\nrestricted, and in due process of time done away with in the slave\r\nStates. To strain this provision to mean that it advocated the natural\r\nright of slavery, and recognized the slave as property, to be sold and\r\nbought like other merchandise, is simply to say that the framers of the\r\nConstitution were the greatest hypocrites in the world, originating the\r\nDeclaration of Independence upon the basis of the natural right of all\r\nmen to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and yet with full\r\nknowledge and purpose giving the lie to this instrument in the\r\nConstitution. Madison thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the\r\nidea of property in man. The word 'service' was substituted for\r\n'servitude,' simply because this last encouraged the idea of property.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional provision for the rendition of slaves was simply a\r\ncompromise between union and slavery. Of the two evils of _no union_, or\r\n_no slavery_, it was thought the former was the worse, and consequently\r\nthe free States fell in with the measure. But could the patriots of the\r\nRevolution have foreseen the gigantic growth of slavery, and the use\r\nthat would have been made of the provision recognizing it, no\r\nconsideration would have induced them to adopt a course that has been\r\nprolific of so much misrepresentation and mischief to the country. They\r\nleft the suppression of slavery to the States where it existed, but\r\nthere was no intention to ingraft the idea of property in man in the\r\nConstitution, or to favor its extension beyond the original slave States\r\nin any way. John Jay, the first Chief-Justice, was preëminently\r\nqualified to judge respecting this. We have his testimony most\r\nexplicitly denying the natural right of property in slaves, and\r\ndeclaring that the Constitution did not recognize the equity of its\r\nextension in the new States or Territories. Who was there more\r\nconversant with the genius of our country than Washington; and yet how\r\nfull is his testimony to the evil of slavery; its want of natural right\r\nto support it, and the necessity of its speedy suppression and\r\nabolition? Is it possible that he, himself a slaveholder and an\r\nemancipationist, could utter such sentiments and enforce them by his\r\nexample, if he regarded the Constitution as establishing the light of\r\nproperty in man, and the benefit of the indefinite expansion of slavery\r\nover the country? No, indeed! If we may consider the Constitution in\r\nrelation to slaves an inconsistent instrument, we can not prove it an\r\nhypocritical and dishonest one. The hard necessities of the times wrung\r\nout of reluctant patriots the admission of the rendition of slaves, but\r\nthey would not by any reasonable construction of language, assert the\r\nnatural right of property in slaves, and the propriety or benefit of its\r\ntoleration in new States and Territories. It was bad enough to tolerate\r\nthis evil in the old slave States, but it would be infamous to hand down\r\nto posterity a Constitution denying the self-evident truths of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. Toleration is not synonymous with approval,\r\nor existence with right. There is a most subtle error in the assumption\r\nof the indifference of the Constitution to freedom and slavery--that it\r\nadvocated neither, but protected both. Certainly the framers of the\r\nConstitution were not automatons, or this instrument the accident of the\r\nthrow of the dice-box. The great purpose of this instrument was to raise\r\nthe revenue, and defend the country. Its end was to protect the\r\nliberties and command the respect of civilized nations. The old\r\nConfederation was to give way to the Federal Constitution. The\r\nindependence of the United States had been achieved at a heavy cost. To\r\nsay nothing of frontiers exposed, country ravaged, towns burnt, commerce\r\nnearly ruined, the derangement of finances--the pecuniary loss alone\r\namounted to one hundred and seventy million dollars, two thirds of which\r\nhad been expended by Congress, the balance by individual States. The\r\ndesign of the Constitution was to preserve the fruits of the Revolution,\r\nto respect State sovereignty, and yet secure a powerful and efficient\r\nUnion; to have a central government, and yet not infringe upon the local\r\nrights of the States. It will, therefore, be seen that while the subject\r\nof slavery was earnestly discussed, and presented at the outset a great\r\nobstacle to the union of the States, yet it was thought, upon the whole,\r\nbest to leave to the slave States the business of doing away with this\r\ngreat evil in such a manner as in their judgment might best conduce to\r\ntheir own security and the preservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut no truth of history is more evident than that the authors of the\r\nConstitution regarded slavery as impossible to be sustained upon the\r\nground of the natural rights of mankind, and deserving of no\r\nencouragement in the Territories, or States hereafter to come into the\r\nUnion. It was thought that the best interests of the slave States would\r\nlead them to abolish slavery, and that before many years, the Republic\r\nwould cease to bear the disgrace of chattel bondage. It is certainly\r\nproper that the acts and language of the authors of the Constitution,\r\nand those who chiefly were instrumental in achieving our independence,\r\nshould be made to interpret that instrument which was the creation of\r\ntheir own toils and love of country. Because the circumstances of the\r\npresent day have brought about a mighty change in the feelings and\r\nopinions of the slave States, it does not follow that the Constitution\r\nin its original intention and spirit should be accommodated to this new\r\naspect of things. It is easy to get up a theory of the natural right of\r\nslavery, and then say that the Constitution meant that the slave States\r\nshould carry slave property just where the free States carry their\r\nproperty; but when this ground is taken, the Constitution is made, to\r\nall intents, a pro-slavery instrument. It ceases to be the charter of a\r\nnation's freedom, and resolves itself into the most effective agent of\r\nthe propagandism of slavery. The transition is easy from such a theory\r\nto the fulfillment of the boast of Senator Toombs, 'that the roll of\r\nslaves might yet be called at the foot of Bunker Hill Monument.' But no\r\nstraining of the language of the Constitution can make it mean the\r\nrecognition of the natural right of slavery, The guarded manner in which\r\nthe provision was made for the rendition of slaves, and all the\r\ncircumstances connected with the adoption of the Constitution, show\r\nconclusively that slavery was considered only a local and municipal\r\ninstitution, a serious evil, to be suppressed and curtailed by the slave\r\nStates, and never by the General Government a blessing to be fostered\r\nand extended where it did not exist at the time the Union of the\r\nthirteen States was perfected.\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate States, in a\r\nspeech at Atlanta, Georgia, said:\r\n\r\n     'Jefferson, Madison, Washington, and many others, were tender of\r\n     the word slave, in the organic law, and all looked forward to the\r\n     time when the institution of slavery should be removed from our\r\n     midst as a trouble and a stumbling-block. The delusion could not be\r\n     traced in any of the component parts of the Southern Constitution.\r\n     In that instrument we solemnly discarded the pestilent heresy of\r\n     fancy politicians, that all men of all races were equal, and we\r\n     have made African inequality, and subordination, the chief\r\n     corner-stone of the Southern Republic.'\r\n\r\nHere we have the great idea of an essential difference in relation to\r\nthe Constitution and slavery existing at the present day South, from\r\nthat which did exist at the time of its ratification universally by the\r\npeople of the thirteen States. The Vice-President of the Southern\r\nConfederacy frankly admits that slavery is its chief corner-stone; that\r\nour ancestors were deluded upon the subject of slavery; that the ideas\r\ncontained in the Declaration of Independence respecting the equality of\r\nall men, and their natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness, are only the pestilent heresy of fancy politicians;\r\nconsequently that in the Southern Constitution all such trash was\r\nsolemnly discarded. Can clearer proof be wanted to show that the\r\nstand-point of slavery and freedom has altogether changed since the days\r\nof Washington? Is it not true that our country at the present day\r\npresents the singular spectacle of two great divisions, one holding to\r\nthe Constitution as interpreted by our ancestors North and South, the\r\nother openly repudiating such interpretation? Is it strange, with such a\r\nradical difference existing as to the import of the Constitution upon\r\nthe subject of slavery, that we should have such frequent and ever\r\npersistent charges of Northern aggression? If the history of slavery be\r\nkept in mind, it will be seen that it has steadily had its eye upon one\r\nend, and that is national aggrandizement. Thus about two hundred\r\nthousand slaveholders wield all the political power of the South, and\r\ncompel all non-slaveholders to acquiesce in their supremacy. But\r\nwhatever the South may choose to do, the North is under obligation to\r\ngive to slavery nothing more than what is guaranteed in the\r\nConstitution. If more than this is asked for, the North is bound by a\r\njust regard for its own interests and the prosperity of the country to\r\nrefuse compliance. It has been seen that even admitting that a State has\r\na just cause of complaint, or supposing as a matter of fact that the\r\nConstitution is violated, she can not set herself up to be exclusively\r\nthe judge in this matter, and leave the Union at her convenience.\r\n\r\nThe history of our country reveals two memorable cases where the\r\nquestion was decided that not the State, but the Federal Government was\r\nto be its own judge of what was constitutional, and act accordingly.\r\nFirst, the case of New-York; secondly, the course taken by Massachusetts\r\nin relation to the Embargo law of 1807, which was believed to be\r\nunconstitutional generally in New-England. In the case of New-York,\r\nthere was, as has been said, the surrender of any right to secede from\r\nthe Union at her pleasure; while in the Embargo law of 1807, which was\r\nbrought up to the Supreme Court for decision, there was the acquiescence\r\nof New-England upon the simple point, who should be the final arbiter in\r\nthe dispute. Massachusetts and all New-England assented to a decision of\r\nthe Judiciary, not upon the ground that it was right, but that the\r\nSupreme Court had alone the authority to say what was right.\r\n\r\nIn this case there was a perfect refutation of the whole theory of\r\nsecession; that theory falls back upon the idea that the State\r\ngovernment is to be its own judge of what constitutes a violation of the\r\nConstitution, and act accordingly; but the Embargo law of 1807, when\r\ncarried up to the Supreme bench, and the way New-England assented to a\r\ndecision that was not believed to be in accordance with the\r\nConstitution, is a signal rebuke of the assumption of State sovereignty\r\nwhen arrayed against the General Government. The all-important question\r\nwas not, Was the decision of the Judiciary right, but simply, Who had\r\nthe authority to say what was right? Who should submit to that\r\nauthority? No person can fail to see in these two cases, under\r\ncircumstances so widely different, and with an end proposed in each\r\ndirectly the reverse of the other, that the point so important to\r\nestablish was clearly made out, that the National Government reserves to\r\nitself alone the right to decide as to what should be the course taken\r\nin questions of dispute that arise between the States and the Federal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt is mournful to see the finest country on the earth--a land peculiarly\r\nblessed with every element of material wealth, a land that has grown\r\nlike a giant, and commanded the respect of the world--now in her central\r\ngovernment made an object of contempt, and crippled in her strength by\r\nthose very States who should, upon the principle of gratitude for favors\r\ngranted, have been the last to leave the Union. While the Government at\r\nWashington has shown the utmost forbearance, they have manifested the\r\ngreatest insolence, as well as disregard of the most sacred rights of\r\nthe Union. An Absalom the most willful and impetuous of his father's\r\nfamily, and yet the most caressed and indulged, requites every debt of\r\nparental kindness by seeking through treachery and the prostitution of\r\nall his privileges to raise an insurrection in the household of David,\r\nand turn away through craft the hearts of the people from their rightful\r\nlord. So like Absalom, South-Carolina first unfurls the banner of\r\ntreason and war among the sister States, desperately resolved to secure\r\nher selfish aggrandizement even at the price of the ruin of the country,\r\nbut like Absalom, also, she is destined to experience a reverse as\r\nignominious and as fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A STORY OF MEXICAN LIFE_\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n'My neighbor gazed at the stranger with bewilderment, and remained\r\nspeechless. There was, nevertheless, nothing in his outward mien to give\r\nrise to so much emotion. He was a robust and rather handsome fellow, of\r\nabout twenty-five, bold, swaggering, and free and easy in his\r\ndeportment--a perfect specimen of the race of half-breeds so common in\r\nMexico. His skin was swarthy, his features regular, and his beard\r\nluxuriant and soft as silk. His eyes were large and black as sloes, his\r\nteeth small, regular, and white as ivory, and his whole countenance,\r\nwhen in repose, wore an expression which won confidence rather than\r\nexcited distrust. But when conversing, there was an indefinable\r\ncraftiness in his smile, and a peculiar cunning in the twinkle of his\r\neye, that often strikes the traveler in Mexico, as pervading all that\r\nclass who are accustomed to making excursions into the interior. His\r\ncostume, covered with dust, and torn in many places, led me to infer\r\nthat he had only just returned from some long journey.\r\n\r\n'After waiting, with great politeness, for some few seconds, to allow\r\nArthur time to address him, and finding he waited in vain, the Mexican\r\nopened the conversation:\r\n\r\n''I fear your excellency will scold me for delaying so long on the road;\r\nbut how could I help it? I am more to be pitied than blamed--I lost\r\nthree horses--at monte--and if it had not been by good luck that the ace\r\nturned up when I staked my saddle and bridle, I should not be here even\r\nnow; but the ace won; I bought a fresh horse--and here I am.'\r\n\r\n''What success?' inquired Arthur, with a look of intense anxiety; 'did\r\nyou bring any?'\r\n\r\n''Certainly,' replied Pepito, handing him very unconcernedly a small\r\npackage; 'I brought more than you told me, and, in fact, I might have\r\nbrought a mule-load if you had wanted so many.'\r\n\r\n''Adéle!' cried Mr. Livermore, overcome with delight, as he rushed into\r\nmy room, 'Adéle, HE HAS FOUND IT!'\r\n\r\nPepito followed Arthur with his sharp eye, and on beholding Adéle, asked\r\nme, in a low tone:\r\n\r\n''Who is that lady, Caballero?'\r\n\r\n''I can not say; I myself never saw her until to-day,' said I; and\r\nnoticing his gaze riveted on her in apparent admiration, I added:\r\n\r\n''Do you think her pretty?'\r\n\r\n''Pretty! Holy Virgin! she is lovely enough to make a man risk his\r\nsalvation to win her.'\r\n\r\n'Feeling that my presence might be one of those superfluities with which\r\nthey would gratefully dispense, I was on the point of leaving, when\r\nthere was a knock at the door. Again Adéle sought refuge in my room, and\r\nagain Arthur advanced to the door:\r\n\r\n''Open, it is I,' said a voice from the outside; 'I have come to inquire\r\nafter my friend Pepito.'\r\n\r\n''Señor,' exclaimed Pepito, 'that must be my compadre, Pedro.'\r\n\r\n'On the door being opened, they flew to one another's arms, and gave a\r\ntrue Mexican embrace.\r\n\r\n'The entrance of Pedro, which evidently annoyed Mr. Livermore, awakened\r\nin my mind strange suspicions. I resolved at the earliest opportunity I\r\nhad of a private interview with him, to allude to what I had overheard\r\non the Alameda. In the mean time I would keep an eye on these two\r\ncronies.\r\n\r\n''Stand back, Pedro, and let me have a good look at you.'\r\n\r\n''_There!_ well, how do you think I look?'\r\n\r\n''My dear fellow, you are growing decidedly coarse and fat.'\r\n\r\n''Bah! but how do you like my new rig?'\r\n\r\n''I can not admire the cut; but, of course, you bought them\r\nready-made--one could see that with half an eye.'\r\n\r\n''Well, Pepito, now that you are once more back in the city, I lack\r\nnothing to make me perfectly happy. You will spend the rest of the day\r\nwith me?'\r\n\r\n''Of course, my dear fellow.'\r\n\r\n''Well, it is about dinner-time; let us be off.'\r\n\r\n''Wait till I have first bid adieu to his excellency,' replied Pepito,\r\nturning toward Mr. Livermore. Then advancing a few steps, he whispered a\r\nfew words to him, at the same time bowing very low. Arthur unlocked the\r\ndrawer of his table and took out a roll of dollars, which he handed to\r\nthe Mexican.\r\n\r\n''Must you absolutely leave me so soon?' said he.\r\n\r\n''Well, Caballero, after so long a journey, a man requires relaxation,\r\nand enjoys a social glass; so, with your permission, I will see you\r\nagain to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'This answer was any thing but pleasing to Mr. Livermore, who turned to\r\nme, and addressing me in English, said:\r\n\r\n''My dear sir, once more I must trespass on your good-nature. It is\r\nessential to the success of my plans, that these two men should not be\r\nleft together. Will you, _can_ you, tack yourself on to them, and keep\r\nclose to Pepito until they separate?'\r\n\r\n''Your request is as strange as it is difficult of execution; but I will\r\ndo my best.'\r\n\r\n''Gentlemen,' said I, to the two Mexicans, as we all three were going\r\ndown the stairs, 'you were speaking of dining--now I want to visit a\r\nreal Mexican _fonda_; I am tired of these French cafés; will you favor\r\nme by taking me to a first-rate house, for I am not acquainted with this\r\ncity.'\r\n\r\n''If you will accompany us to the Fonda Genovesa, Caballero,' said\r\nPedro, 'I will warrant you will have no cause to repent it.'\r\n\r\n''I am infinitely indebted to you, and shall gladly accept your\r\nguidance.'\r\n\r\n'The Fonda Genovesa was certainly one of the vilest establishments I\r\never visited, and the dinner was, of course, detestably bad. However, I\r\ntreated my two worthies to a couple of bottles of wine, which being to\r\nthem a rare luxury, they declared they had fared sumptuously.\r\n\r\n''But, look here, Pepito,' said Pedro, 'you have not yet alluded to your\r\njourney. Where have you been all this time?'\r\n\r\n''Where have I been? Oh! well, that is a secret.'\r\n\r\n''A secret! what, from me, from your compadre Pedro?'\r\n\r\n''Even so, my dear Pedro, even so; I have sworn not to mention the\r\nobject of my journey nor my destination.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! I dare say; but look here, what did you swear by--the holy Virgin\r\nof Guadalupe? No? Well, was it the cross?'\r\n\r\n''No, neither by the one nor the other.'\r\n\r\n''What is there binding, then? nothing else ought to keep you silent\r\nwhen _I_ am in question?'\r\n\r\n''I pledged my sacred honor.'\r\n\r\n''Your sacred honor! Give me your hand, you always were a wag, but you\r\nhumbugged me this time, I confess; well, that _is_ a good one--the best\r\njoke I have heard for an age--excellent! well, go on, I am all\r\nattention, all ears.'\r\n\r\n''Well, you won't hear much, for I am a man of honor, and bound not to\r\nspeak; besides, I received a hundred dollars to keep mum.'\r\n\r\n'Pedro for a moment appeared to be in a brown study; at last, gazing\r\nhard at his friend, he said:\r\n\r\n''Would two hundred tempt you to speak?'\r\n\r\n''If such a proposition were to come from a stranger, I might,\r\nperchance, accept it; but seeing it comes from you--never.'\r\n\r\n''Why?'\r\n\r\n''Because, when you offer me two hundred dollars for any thing, it must\r\nbe worth far more than you offer.'\r\n\r\n''Well, now, admit, just as a supposition, that I am interested in this\r\nmatter, what harm will it do you, if we both turn an honest penny?'\r\n\r\n''That is just the point; but I don't want you to turn ten pennies to my\r\none.'\r\n\r\n''Your scruples, my dear Pepito, display a cautious temperament, and\r\nevince deep acquaintance with human nature; you see through my little\r\nveil of mystery, and I own your sagacity; now I will be honest with\r\nyou--with a man like you, lying is mere folly. It is true, I am to have\r\nfour hundred dollars if I can find out where you have been. I swear to\r\nyou by the holy Virgin of Guadalupe, I am making a clean breast of it.\r\nNow, will you take that amount? Say the word, and I will go and fetch it\r\nright away.'\r\n\r\n'This proposition seemed to embarrass the scrupulous Pepito extremely,\r\nand he remained some time lost in thought.\r\n\r\n''But, if you only receive four hundred, and give me four hundred, what\r\nthe deuce will you make out of such an operation?'\r\n\r\n''Trust entirely to your generosity.'\r\n\r\n''What! leave me to do what I like! I take you up--by Jupiter! Pedro,\r\nthat is a noble trait in your character--I take you up.'\r\n\r\n''Then it is a bargain. Will you wait here for me, or would you prefer\r\nto meet me at our usual Monte in the Calle de los Meradores?'\r\n\r\n''I prefer the Monte.'\r\n\r\n''You will swear on the cross, to relate fully and truly every\r\nparticular relating to your journey?'\r\n\r\n''Of course--every thing.'\r\n\r\n''I will be there in a couple of hours.'\r\n\r\n'After his friend's departure, Pepito sat silent; his brow was knit, and\r\nyet a mocking sneer played around his lips; he seemed to be pursuing two\r\ntrains of thought at once; suspicion and merriment were clearly working\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n''This is a droll affair, Caballero; I can't clearly see the bottom of\r\nit'\r\n\r\n''There is nothing very unusual in it that I see,' I replied, 'for every\r\nday men sacrifice honor for gold.'\r\n\r\n''True, nothing more common, and yet this proposition beats all I ever\r\nmet with.'\r\n\r\n''In what respect?'\r\n\r\n''Why, the interest that these folks who employ Pedro, take in this\r\njourney that I undertook for your friend, Señor Pride.'\r\n\r\n''But, if this journey has some valuable secret object in view?'\r\n\r\n''Valuable secret!' repeated Pepito, bursting into a fit of laughter;\r\n'Yes, a valuable secret indeed! Oh! the joke of offering four hundred\r\ndollars for what, 'twixt you and me, is not worth a cent. But who can it\r\nbe that is behind Pedro, in this matter? He must be some rival doctor,\r\nor else a naturalist, on the same scent.'\r\n\r\n''Is Señor Pride,' I inquired, 'a doctor--are you sure of that?'\r\n\r\n''Yes--he must be--but I don't know,' exclaimed Pepito; 'I am at my\r\nwits' end. If he is not, I have been working in the dark, and he has\r\ndeceived me with a false pretext; I am at a loss--dead beat. But one\r\nthing is plain--I can make four hundred dollars, if I like.'\r\n\r\n''And will you betray your employer?' said I indignantly.\r\n\r\n''Time enough--never decide rashly, Caballero; I shall\r\ndeliberate--nothing like sleeping on important affairs; to-morrow--who\r\nknows what to-morrow may bring forth?'\r\n\r\n'So saying, Pepito arose, took his traveling sword under his arm, placed\r\nhis hat jauntily on his head, cast an admiring eye at the looking-glass,\r\nand then brushed off some of the dust that still clung to his left\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n''The smile of Heaven abide with you, Señor,' said he, with a most\r\ngraceful bow. 'As for your friend's secret, do not be uneasy about it; I\r\nam not going to meet Pedro to-night. I shall take advantage of his\r\nabsence to make a call on my lady-love. Pedro is a good fellow, but\r\nshockingly self-conceited; he fancies himself far smarter than\r\nI--perhaps he is--but somehow I fancy, this time he must be early if he\r\ncatches me asleep.'\r\n\r\n'On his departure, I paid the bill, which both my friends had\r\noverlooked, then walked out and seated myself on the Alameda, which at\r\nthat hour was thronged with promenaders. Isolated, buried in thought, in\r\nthe midst of that teeming throng, the various episodes in the drama of\r\nwhich my mysterious neighbor was the principal character, passed before\r\nmy mind. I again and again reviewed the strange events which, by some\r\nfreak of fortune, I had been a witness to. What was the basis on which\r\nmy friend, with two sets of names, founded his dream of inexhaustible\r\nwealth, this mission he had intrusted to Pepito? What the mission which\r\nthe agent laughed at, and which to gain a clue to, others were tempting\r\nhim with glittering bribes? And again, why the deceit practiced on\r\nPepito, by assuming the guise of a doctor? Each of these facts was a\r\ntext on which I piled a mountain of speculation.\r\n\r\n'Vexed and annoyed at finding myself becoming entangled in this web of\r\nmystery, as well as piqued at my failure to unravel it, I determined to\r\navoid all further connection with any of the actors; and full of this\r\nresolve, I wended my way homeward, to have a final and decisive\r\ninterview with Mr. Livermore.\r\n\r\n'The worthy Donna Teresa Lopez confronted me as I entered the inner\r\ndoor:\r\n\r\n''Plenty of news, is there not?' she asked; 'I heard a good deal of\r\nsquabbling, last night; that man in the cloak was noisy.'\r\n\r\n''Yes; they had an interesting discussion.'\r\n\r\n''You can not make me believe that was all. _Discussion_, indeed! When\r\nthere is a pretty woman in the case, and two men talk as loudly as they\r\ndid, it generally ends in a serious kind of discussion. 'When love stirs\r\nthe fire, anger makes the blood boil.' Tell me, now, will they fight\r\nhere, in the Señor Pride's room?'\r\n\r\n'This question, which Donna Teresa put in the most matter-of-fact sort\r\nof way, staggered me considerably, and confirmed me in the resolution to\r\navoid the whole business.\r\n\r\n''I sincerely trust, Señora, that such an event is not probable. On what\r\ndo you base your supposition?'\r\n\r\n''There is nothing so very astounding in rivals fighting; but it is all\r\nthe same to me. I only asked that I might take precautions.'\r\n\r\n''Precautions! what, inform the police?'\r\n\r\n''No, no! I thought it might be as well to take down the new\r\ncurtains--the blood might spoil them.'\r\n\r\n'Need I say I terminated my interview with my hostess, more impressed\r\nwith admiration of her business qualities than of her sympathetic\r\nvirtues? But let me do the poor woman justice; life is held so cheap,\r\nand the knife acts so large a part in Mexico, that violence and sudden\r\ndeath produce a mere transient effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n'Instead of going to my own apartments, I went direct to Mr.\r\nLivermore's, intending thus to show him that I wished no longer to be\r\nlooked upon as the man in the next room.\r\n\r\n''We were dying with anxiety to see you,' he said, as I entered; 'walk\r\ninto the other room, you will find Adéle there.'\r\n\r\n''Well, Mr. Rideau,' said she, with intense anxiety visible on her\r\ncountenance, 'what passed between those two men?'\r\n\r\n''Little of importance. Pedro offered Pepito four hundred dollars if he\r\nwould divulge the particulars of his journey; to which offer Pepito has\r\nacceded. That is about all.'\r\n\r\n'I was far from anticipating the effect my answer would produce on my\r\nhearers. They were overwhelmed--thunderstruck. Adéle was the first to\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\n''Fool! fool that I was,' she exclaimed, 'why did I select in such an\r\nenterprise a man worn down by sickness and disease?'\r\n\r\n'The look she cast on Arthur, rapid as it was, was so full of menace\r\nand reproach, that it startled me.\r\n\r\n''Well, Arthur,' she said, laying her hand on his arm; 'do you feel ill\r\nagain?'\r\n\r\n'Roused by the sound of her voice, Arthur placed his hand on his heart,\r\nand mutely plead excuse for the silence which his sufferings imposed on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'As for me, I spoke no word, but mentally consigned my mysterious\r\nneighbors to a distant port, whence consignments never return.\r\n\r\n''My dear sir,' I replied at length, 'Pepito's treachery, which appears\r\nso deeply to affect you, is not yet carried into execution, it is only\r\ncontemplated. I will give you word for word what transpired.'\r\n\r\n'When I had concluded my narrative, to which they listened with\r\nbreathless attention, Adéle exclaimed:\r\n\r\n''Our hopes are not yet crushed, the case is not utterly desperate; but\r\nalas! it is evident our secret is suspected, if not known. Arthur,' she\r\ncontinued, 'now is the time to display all our energy. We have some\r\nenemy to dread, as I have long suspected. If we do not at once steal a\r\nmarch on him, then farewell forever to all our dreams of happiness, of\r\nwealth, or even of subsistence.'\r\n\r\n''Sir,' said she, again addressing me; 'your honor alone has kept you in\r\nignorance of our secret. You could easily have tempted and corrupted\r\nPepito. We prefer you should learn it from us rather than from an\r\naccidental source. We merely request your word of honor that you will\r\nnot use it to your own advantage, without our joint consent, nor in any\r\nway thwart our plans.'\r\n\r\n''I am deeply sensible, madame, of the confidence you repose in me; but\r\nI must beg you will allow me to remain in ignorance.'\r\n\r\n''You refuse, then, to give us the promise?' exclaimed Adéle, 'I see it\r\nall! you will thwart us; you would preserve your liberty of action\r\nwithout forfeiting your word.'\r\n\r\n'If you had known me longer, such a suspicion would not have crossed\r\nyour mind. However, as I have no other means of proving it unjust, I\r\nwill give the pledge you desire, I am now ready to hear whatever you\r\nhave to communicate.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Livermore resumed the conversation:\r\n\r\n''The secret which Adéle imparted to me will, I dare say, appear at\r\nfirst very extravagant, but before you laugh at it, give me time to\r\nexplain. It is the existence of a marvelous opal mine in the interior;\r\nthe precise location of which is known to no one save Adéle and myself.'\r\n\r\n'In spite of the greatest effort, I could not suppress a smile of\r\nincredulity, at this announcement. Mexico is so full of strange stories\r\nof fabulous mines, that this wondrous tale of opals looked to me like\r\nsome new confidence game, and I felt sure my neighbors were duped or\r\nelse trying to dupe me.\r\n\r\n''Oh! I see you think we are deceived?'\r\n\r\n''I admit,' I replied, 'it strikes me as possible that you have been the\r\nvictims of some crafty scheme. Did you hear of this mine before or since\r\nyour arrival in Mexico?'\r\n\r\n''Before we left New-Orleans.'\r\n\r\n''And yet it is not known to the natives?'\r\n\r\n''It was from a Mexican we had our information.'\r\n\r\n''Why did not this Mexican himself take advantage of it?'\r\n\r\n''He could not, for he was banished. He is now dead. But what do you\r\nthink of these specimens?'\r\n\r\n'He took from a drawer ten or twelve opals of rare size and brilliancy.\r\nI examined them with care; they were, beyond all doubt, of very\r\nconsiderable value. My incredulity gradually gave way to amazement.\r\n\r\n''Are you certain these opals really came from the mine of which you\r\nspeak?'\r\n\r\n''Nothing can be more certain; you saw Pepito hand me a package; you\r\nheard his remark that he could have brought a mule-load; these are a\r\nfew of what he did bring.'\r\n\r\n''This mine then really exists?' I said, my incredulity giving way to\r\nthe most ardent curiosity.\r\n\r\n''Really exists! yes, my friend; if you listen, I will dispel all doubt\r\nof that.'\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n''On arriving in this country, my first step was to procure a guide and\r\nthe necessary equipage for reaching the opal mine. Although I felt sure\r\nof its existence, I could not dispel the fear that the story of its\r\nmarvelous richness would prove false. Without loss of time, I started;\r\nfor to me it was a question of life and death. I had, however, barely\r\naccomplished a third of the journey, when I was prostrated by fever. The\r\nfatigue of traveling in the interior of this magnificent but wretched\r\ncountry, combined with excitement and anxiety, preyed upon my mind, and\r\nbrought on an illness, from which at one time I gave up all hope of\r\nrecovering. I was compelled to return to Vera Cruz. The doctors were all\r\nof the opinion that several months of perfect repose would be necessary\r\nbefore I could undertake another such journey. Several months--oh! how\r\nthose words fell on my ears; they sounded like the knell of all my\r\nhopes. A thousand expedients floated through my brain, and in adopting\r\nthe course I eventually did, time alone will prove whether I followed\r\nthe promptings of a good or evil genius. One evening, I explained to my\r\nattendant that I was a medical man, deeply interested in botanical and\r\nmineralogical discoveries; that my object in undertaking my recent\r\njourney was to collect certain rare herbs and a singular description of\r\nshell. I laid peculiar stress on the herbs, and added in relation to the\r\nshells, that I merely wanted a few specimens, as they were rare in my\r\ncountry. My attendant at once proffered his services, to go in search of\r\nthem. I appeared at first to attach but little importance to his offer;\r\nbut as he renewed it whenever the subject was alluded to, I at last\r\nemployed him. The mine is situated on the margin of a little brook. One\r\nday's work of an active man will turn the stream into a fresh channel,\r\nand a few inches beneath its bed will be found, mixed with the damp sand\r\nand loam, the shells, which, when polished, form the opal. I gave my\r\nservant the needful information as to localities and landmarks, and\r\npromised him a gratuity of a hundred dollars over and above his wages,\r\nin case he succeeded. Having given him instructions, I retained his\r\nservices until I reached this city, where I determined to await his\r\nreturn, it being more healthy than Vera Cruz. Having selected my\r\nlodgings and given him the pass-word by which alone a stranger could\r\nobtain admittance to me, with an anxious heart I dispatched him on the\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n''For three months I had no tidings of him; night and day, I was the\r\nprey of doubt and fear. No words can portray the agony of suspense that\r\nI endured; the hours seemed days, the days months, and the bitterness of\r\nyears was crowded into that short interval. At last, thanks be to\r\nheaven, my messenger returned.'\r\n\r\n''Do you mean Pepito?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n''The very man,' replied Arthur; 'his journey was successful. You have\r\nseen the specimens he brought. I was intoxicated with delight; but Adéle\r\ndid not share my joy. Nature has given woman a faculty of intuition\r\ndenied to man. Alas! Adéle's presentiment has been verified; your\r\naccount of the interview between Pepito and his friend proves her fears\r\nwere well-grounded.'\r\n\r\n''In what way?'\r\n\r\n''In _this_ way; it shows we have an enemy who has an inkling of our\r\nsecret, and is striving to snatch the prize from us. What course to take\r\nI am at a loss to know. Adéle advises to make sure of Pepito, at any\r\nprice.'\r\n\r\n''And that strikes me as being your surest if not your only course.'\r\n\r\n''Yes, the surest; but how to make _sure_ of him?'\r\n\r\n''By outbidding your competitors, and proving to him that in adhering to\r\nyou he is best serving his own interests.'\r\n\r\n''But he is base enough to take bribes from both sides, and betray\r\neach.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! that I were a man!' exclaimed Adéle, 'this fellow is the only one\r\nwho knows our secret. One man ought not to stand in fear of another.\r\nOnly _one_ man crosses your path, Arthur.'\r\n\r\n''Unless I murder him, how can he be silenced?'\r\n\r\n''_Murder_ him! It is not murder to kill a robber. Were _I_ a man, I\r\nwould not hesitate how to act.'\r\n\r\n''The anxiety of Pedro,' I said, 'indicates you have an enemy. Have you\r\nany idea who he is?'\r\n\r\n''I believe,' said Adéle, 'that I know him.'\r\n\r\n''Are you sure there is only one?'\r\n\r\n''Why do you ask?' said the woman, fixing her eye upon me as though she\r\nwould, in spite of every obstacle, read my inmost thoughts.\r\n\r\n''Because I fancy there are _two_, for instance, Brown and Hunt.'\r\n\r\n'At the mention of these names Adéle started to her feet, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n''On all sides there is treachery. I _demand_, sir, an explanation. What\r\nleads you to associate the name of that firm with this matter? Either\r\nyou are our friend or you are not. Speak plainly!'\r\n\r\n''Madame, by the merest chance, I overheard Pedro mention those names,\r\nand since you have given me your confidence, I will give you some\r\ninformation which may put you on your guard, and help to guide your\r\nfuture plans.'\r\n\r\n'I then briefly related the conversations I had overheard between\r\nGeneral Valiente and Pedro, both on the Alameda and in the gaming-house\r\nin the Calle del Arco.\r\n\r\n''Now, madame,' I continued, 'let me inquire whether the Mexican from\r\nwhom you derived your information, had any connection with this firm?'\r\n\r\n''Yes, sir, he knew them,' she replied; then, after a slight pause, she\r\nadded: 'We have already told you so much that it would be folly to\r\nconceal the way in which we became acquainted with the existence of this\r\nmine. Soon after my marriage, I met a veteran officer of the Mexican\r\narmy, General Ramiro, then living in exile, at New-Orleans. For me he\r\nconceived a paternal affection, and many a time remonstrated with Mr.\r\nPercival, and entreated him to devote himself to his family, and abandon\r\nthe course of life which was leading him to ruin. He often spoke of his\r\ndesire to return to Mexico, and lived constantly in the hope of the\r\ndecree being revoked, which had driven him into exile. One day he\r\ndisclosed the chief cause of his desire to return, by revealing the\r\nsecret we have imparted to you.'\r\n\r\n''Pardon me, madame,' I said, 'but tell me how General Ramiro gained his\r\ninformation? Exploring for opal mines is hardly part of the duties of a\r\nGeneral, even in Mexico.'\r\n\r\n''I was about to explain that,' replied the lady. 'An Indian, convicted\r\nof murdering a monk, some three years previously, was condemned to\r\ndeath. On being taken, according to Mexican usage, on the eve of\r\nexecution, to the confessional, he refused the slightest attention to\r\nthe exhortations of the priests, affirming that he had written a letter\r\nto the Governor, which would secure his pardon.\r\n\r\n''True enough, a party of dragoons arrived during the night, and took\r\nhim away. The letter was addressed to General Ramiro, then acting as\r\nGovernor, and contained promises of a revelation of the highest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n''When conducted to the General, the Indian proved, by a host of\r\ndetails, the existence of an opal mine, which he had accidentally\r\ndiscovered, and in return for the revelation, demanded a free pardon.'\r\n\r\n''I understand, perfectly, madame,' I added, seeing Adéle hesitate.\r\n\r\n''I feel,' she said, 'a certain reluctance at this portion of my\r\nnarrative, for it forces me to lay bare an act which General Ramiro ever\r\nafter regretted, and which--' ''Madame, I will spare you the recital;\r\nthe fact is, the General gained the Indian's secret, and\r\nthen--unfortunately for the Indian--forgot to fulfill his promise.'\r\n\r\n''Alas! sir, you have rightly judged. Two hours after the interview, the\r\nIndian suffered the garrote, and General Ramiro became the sole\r\npossessor of this important secret. I will not attempt to justify my\r\nvenerable friend. He sincerely lamented his sin, and retribution\r\nfollowed him with long, sad years of exile and poverty. We often sat\r\ntogether for hours, he talking of his wonderful mine, and longing for\r\nhis recall to his native land. His enemies, however, held a firm hold of\r\ngovernment, and growing weary of delay, he made overtures to this firm\r\nof Brown and Hunt, through their correspondents in New-Orleans. Being\r\nsadly in want of funds, he was even mad enough to give a hint of some\r\nkind, relative to an opal mine, which was to be worked by them on joint\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n''Before any definite arrangement was perfected, an event occurred which\r\nis indelibly impressed on my memory. The General, after spending a\r\nportion of the afternoon with us, had returned to his home; and about\r\neleven at night, a messenger begged my immediate attendance on him. He\r\nhad been taken suddenly ill; and my husband, who was cognizant of the\r\npaternal affection the General felt for me, urged me to hasten to his\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n''I found him at the point of death; but my presence seemed to call him\r\nback to life. 'My child,' said he, placing in my hands a very voluminous\r\nletter, 'this is all I have to give you. Farewell, dear child, I am\r\ngoing. Farewell, forever.' In a few moments he was no more. I returned\r\nhome a prey to the most intense grief, and for several days did not\r\nthink of opening the letter I had received from my dying benefactor. It\r\ncontained the most precise details of the situation of the opal mine,\r\nand advice as to the best means of reaching it.\r\n\r\n''So you see, Mr. Rideau,' she added, after a slight pause, 'the secret\r\nis known only to three persons--Arthur, Pepito, and myself. What, under\r\nthe circumstances, would you do?'\r\n\r\n''I see but one course, madame--prompt action; by this means only can\r\nyou hope to succeed. You should start without a day's delay.'\r\n\r\n''And Pepito?'\r\n\r\n''Take him with you.'\r\n\r\n''Your advice would be excellent were it practicable; but the state of\r\nMr. Livermore's health will not permit him to travel.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! never fear, Adéle; your presence and your care will keep me up. I\r\nshall gain strength by change of air and scene.'\r\n\r\n'Adéle was, probably, about to protest against such a proof of his\r\nattachment, when she was interrupted by a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n''It is Pepito,' said I. My conjecture proved correct. Opening the door,\r\nthe Mexican appeared, dressed in a new suit, and evidently not a little\r\nproud of his external improvements. He bowed politely to Mr. Livermore\r\nand myself, and then bending before Adéle, took her hand and raised it\r\nwith true Mexican grace, to his lips.\r\n\r\n''You arrive, Pepito,' said Adéle, 'at the very moment we are talking\r\nabout you.'\r\n\r\n'Pepito again bowed to the lady.\r\n\r\n''Señora,' said he, 'to please you I would die; to obey you I would kill\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\n'The exaggerated tone of Mexican politeness which prompted this reply\r\ndid not surprise Adéle, but it brought a smile to her lips.\r\n\r\n''I trust my wishes will not lead to such disastrous results,' she\r\nreplied. 'The fact is, Señor Pride thinks shortly of undertaking another\r\njourney; and as his health is delicate, we are anxious you should bear\r\nus company. I need not add, the zeal you have already shown, will not\r\nfail to secure our interest in your future welfare.'\r\n\r\n''Indeed! does his excellency intend starting very soon? May I be\r\nallowed to ask where is he going?'\r\n\r\n''To the same place,' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n''Oh! oh! I see; the herbs and shells I brought were not enough to\r\nanswer his excellency's purpose; you want more of the shells--eh,\r\nSeñor?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, a few more,' said Arthur, with a deep sigh, for he felt acutely\r\nthe ironical tone which the Mexican assumed.\r\n\r\n''Well, what would you say, Señor Pride, if, instead of the few I handed\r\nyou, I had brought a sack full--you would not feel angry, would you?'\r\n\r\n''Scoundrel! you have not dared to thus deceive me?' exclaimed Mr.\r\nLivermore, starting to his feet and advancing toward Pepito, with an air\r\nof menace.\r\n\r\n''Unfortunately, I did not; but you have proved to me what a fool I was,\r\nnot to suspect their value. You evidently attach immense importance to\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n''Control your temper, Arthur,' said Adéle, in English, 'or you will\r\nruin every thing.'\r\n\r\n''After all,' resumed Pepito, 'it is only a chance deferred, not a\r\nchance lost. With a good horse, I can soon make up for lost time.'\r\n\r\n'His tone of defiance annihilated the self-possession even of Adéle;\r\nwhile as for Arthur, he looked the very picture of despair. I,\r\ntherefore, resolved to smooth matters over, and if possible, to bring\r\nPepito to terms. At first he listened to me very unwillingly, and\r\nanswered sulkily and laconically; but wearied at last by my pertinacity,\r\nhe suggested that it was scarcely fair play for me to assume to sit as\r\njudge in a cause wherein I was an interested party.'\r\n\r\n''You are strangely mistaken, Pepito,' I said, in reply; 'I can swear to\r\nyou on my honor, and by the holy Virgin of Guadalupe, that I am not in\r\nany way a party to this transaction; and that its success or its failure\r\nwill not affect me to the extent of a real.\r\n\r\n''Oh! I beg your pardon, Caballero,' muttered Pepito, on whom my\r\nadjuration by the holy Virgin of Guadalupe, had produced an unexpected\r\neffect. 'In that case I will trust to your advice; I rely on your honor.\r\nNow tell me--I know very well these shells are valuable--how much would\r\na mule-load be worth--two thousand dollars?'\r\n\r\n''Yes, and perhaps more.'\r\n\r\n''You speak frankly, like a man!' he exclaimed with delight; 'you don't\r\nseek to take advantage of my ignorance; you are a true gentleman. Tell\r\nme where I could sell these things.'\r\n\r\n''You could find no one to buy them in this country; they must be sent\r\neither to Europe or New-York.'\r\n\r\n''The devil! that upsets my plans. I know no one in Europe, no one in\r\nNew-York; besides, I can neither read nor write; I should be cheated on\r\nall hands. Is there no way to settle this business between ourselves?\r\nListen, now: I will agree not only to accompany Señor Pride as his\r\nguide, but to do all the work when we arrive at our destination, on\r\ncondition that he pays me two thousand dollars for every trip we make.\r\nWhat do you say to my proposition?'\r\n\r\n''That it is Señor Pride who must answer you, not I.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n'Obeying the injunction laid upon him by Adéle, Mr. Livermore affected\r\nto demur at the high price placed by Pepito on his cooperation, but\r\nfinally appeared to yield to our joint solicitation.\r\n\r\n''Well, then, the bargain is closed,' said Pepito, smiling. 'Now I can\r\nunderstand why Pedro was so anxious to have me betray my trust. Oh! how\r\ndelighted I am to think he will find I have left him in the lurch.'\r\n\r\n''Señor Pepito,' said Adéle, with a most winning smile, 'do you happen\r\nto know a family residing some short distance from this city, who, in\r\nconsideration of a liberal compensation, would not object to take a lady\r\nto board with them?'\r\n\r\n''I do, Señora, at Toluca.'\r\n\r\n''How far is it from here?'\r\n\r\n''Twelve or fourteen leagues.'\r\n\r\n'' Are you intimate enough with the family to take me there to-morrow,\r\nwithout previously informing them of my intention?'\r\n\r\n''Certainly; the lady I allude to is my sister.'\r\n\r\n''Then to-morrow morning early, at seven, say. But Señor Pepito, I had\r\nforgotten to warn you that in escorting me you will run a great danger.'\r\n\r\n''Oh! I am not afraid of the robbers on the road; they know me well, and\r\nnever molest me.'\r\n\r\n''It is not of robbers that I stand in dread.'\r\n\r\n''Of what, then?'\r\n\r\n''Of a man--an enemy who hates me with a deadly hatred, and who, I fear,\r\nseeks my life.'\r\n\r\n''A man--_one_ man--and he seeks your life; well, well, I should like\r\nto meet him face to face,' exclaimed Pepito.\r\n\r\n''Then, Señor, you promise to protect me at any risk?'\r\n\r\n''Protect you! _yes_,' replied he with vehemence, 'I pledge you my\r\nhonor, my body, and my soul. I will face the bravest of the brave, to\r\ndefend you from injury.'\r\n\r\n''From my heart of hearts I thank you, Pepito,' said Mr. Livermore, 'you\r\nshall find me not ungrateful, and in return for the zeal and devotion\r\nyou have shown, two hundred dollars shall be yours, on your return with\r\ntidings of madame's safe arrival.'\r\n\r\n''I will at once proceed to secure the necessary equipage, Señor.\r\nSeñora, rely on my punctuality; at seven, I shall attend you.'\r\n\r\n''Are you related to Señor Pride?' asked Pepito, as we descended the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n''In no way; I have known him only a few days.'\r\n\r\n''Well, Caballero, I own I am enchanted with his wife; I never met a\r\nwoman of such matchless beauty, such fascinating manners; why, Señor, if\r\nshe said to me, 'Pepito, kill your brother,' and I had a brother, which,\r\nluckily, I have not, I think I should kill him.'\r\n\r\n'These words were uttered with so much vehemence, that I deemed it\r\nadvisable to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n''It seems strange to me,' said I, 'that you should be so intimate with\r\nPedro, and yet be ever on the very verge of quarreling with him.'\r\n\r\n''Well, it is perhaps astonishing to those who do not know us; but\r\nsomehow Pedro is my best, in fact, my only friend. We were brought up in\r\nthe same village, and are just like brothers. He is a good sort of\r\nfellow, but is abominably vain and self-conceited; then he is deucedly\r\noverbearing. He has no delicacy for his friend's feelings, and, in fact,\r\nhas a thousand failings that no one else but I could tolerate. True, we\r\nhave now and then a pretty rough time of it. The two gashes on his left\r\ncheek are mementoes of my regard, and I confess I have two ugly marks,\r\none on my shoulder, the other on my right breast, which I owe to him.\r\nBut what galls me most, he is always talking of his six dead ones, while\r\nI can claim only five; but then my five are all men, while two of his\r\nsix are women.'\r\n\r\n''Horrible!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n''Yes, it is not a fair count; but then it shows his insatiable vanity.\r\nVanity is one of the capital sins; it is hard to tell into what meanness\r\nit may not lead a man.' With this sententious denunciation, the Mexican,\r\nwho had clearly misinterpreted my indignant ejaculation, raised his hat,\r\nwith an air of extreme politeness, and departed.\r\n\r\n'When I again entered Mr. Livermore's apartment, the conversation\r\nnaturally turned on Pepito.\r\n\r\n''Well, what think you of my cavalier?' said Adéle.\r\n\r\n''As you are aware, my acquaintance with him is of but recent date; but\r\none thing speaks greatly in his favor: he has been for several months\r\nattached to Mr. Livermore's person, both as guide and as attendant while\r\nsick, and he has not attempted, as far as I have heard, either to\r\nassassinate or poison him. This I take to be a striking proof of\r\nmeritorious moderation.'\r\n\r\n''I fear, Adéle, we are acting imprudently,' said Arthur, 'in intrusting\r\nyou to the tender mercies of such an unprincipled scoundrel, a man you\r\nhave seen but twice.\r\n\r\n''Good heavens! dearest Arthur, would it be less imprudent for that man\r\nPercival to find me here? I shudder to think of ever again meeting him;\r\nand moreover, by flattering this Pepito and pretending to place entire\r\nconfidence in him, I shall win him to a devoted submission to my every\r\nwish.'\r\n\r\n'After a somewhat protracted but by no means important conversation, I\r\nretired, promising to see them in the morning, previous to Adéle's\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n'Shortly before the appointed hour, Pepito arrived, and announced that\r\nall his preparations had been made. His fair charge quickly made her\r\nappearance, dressed in complete Mexican costume. It suited her\r\nremarkably well, and I was not surprised to observe the intense\r\nadmiration with which Pepito gazed upon her, for her beauty was truly\r\nfascinating. Notwithstanding my suspicions of the absence of that inner\r\nspiritual beauty which should adorn all female loveliness, I myself\r\ncould scarce resist the spell she exercised on my feelings, even in\r\nspite of my judgment.\r\n\r\n'Turning to Pepito, with a smile, she inquired gayly, 'Well, Señor, how\r\ndo you like my change of costume?'\r\n\r\n'The Mexican replied merely by putting his hand on his heart, and bowing\r\nalmost reverentially.\r\n\r\n'Having given Mr. Livermore an affectionate embrace, she exclaimed, in a\r\nfirm, determined voice: 'Let us be off: time is precious.'\r\n\r\n'It had been arranged that I should accompany them until they were out\r\nof the city. I therefore left Mr. Livermore alone, and followed the two\r\ntravelers. On reaching the street, Adéle took the Mexican's arm; but as\r\nthey turned the corner of one of the streets running into the Cathedral\r\nSquare, I noticed that she raised her hood and lowered the veil attached\r\nto it. Surprised at this apparently uncalled-for act of caution, I\r\ninquired the reason.\r\n\r\n''Do you not see Mr. Percival?' she exclaimed, in Spanish.\r\n\r\n''Who is he? Is that the man you said you dreaded? that\r\nmelancholy-looking man, who is walking so moodily ahead of us?'\r\nexclaimed Pepito. 'I must have a good look at him.'\r\n\r\n''Be cautious, I beseech you; if he sees me, all is lost.'\r\n\r\n''Fear nothing, I will be discreet; I only want to get one good look at\r\nhim.' So saying, Pepito increased his speed, and was soon walking beside\r\nthe unconscious Percival.\r\n\r\n'In a few minutes, Pepito turned suddenly down a narrow street, into\r\nwhich we followed, and there we found a carriage awaiting us.\r\n\r\n''Señora, I shall know your enemy among a thousand,' was Pepito's\r\nremark, on again offering Adéle his arm, to assist her in entering the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n'We were soon safely out of the city, and taking advantage of the first\r\nreturning carriage we met, I returned with it, Adéle thanked me with\r\nmuch apparent gratitude for my past services, and begged me to devote as\r\nmuch of my leisure as possible to cheering and advising her dear Arthur.\r\n\r\n'On my return, I found him pacing his chamber with intense anxiety, and\r\nevidently prostrated by the excitement he had undergone.\r\n\r\n''Well, what news?' said he, almost gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n''Adéle is beyond the reach of danger.'\r\n\r\n''You met no one?'\r\n\r\n''No one.'\r\n\r\n''Heaven be praised; and yet I feel a presentiment I shall never see her\r\nagain--never.'\r\n\r\n''Pshaw! love is always timorous; it delights in raising phantoms.'\r\n\r\n''This is no phantom; death is a reality, and, mark my words, on earth\r\nwe shall meet no more.'\r\n\r\n'Overcome by the violence of his emotions, he buried his face in his\r\nhands, and gave way to an outburst of Intense grief. Yielding, finally,\r\nto my reiterated entreaties, he threw himself upon his bed, and, as I\r\nhad some private business to settle, I left him to the care of our\r\nofficious hostess, who was only too happy to find one on whom she could\r\ndisplay her self-acquired knowledge of the healing art.\r\n\r\n'The next day, Arthur, though still feeble, was able to walk about his\r\napartments. Toward dusk, a letter arrived from Adéle. She announced her\r\nsafe arrival at Toluca, spoke in terms of praise of Pepito's devotion\r\nand attention, and expressed herself agreeably surprised at the\r\nhospitality she had received from his sister. The receipt of this letter\r\nproduced a marked improvement in my patient's health. In a postscript,\r\nreference was made to an accident which had happened to poor Pepito, who\r\nwas prevented from being the bearer of this letter, by having sprained\r\nhis ankle. This would retard his return to the city for a day or two;\r\nnevertheless, she begged her 'dear Arthur' not to be uneasy, as even\r\nthis delay, annoying as it was, might prove of advantage, as it would\r\ngive him time to recover from the effects of the excitement of the past\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n'After Adéle's departure, I again fastened up the door of communication,\r\nand although I saw him at least once every day, to some extent I carried\r\nout my determination of ceasing to be on such intimate terms with Mr.\r\nLivermore. I fell back into my former course of life, and yet I felt a\r\ncertain envy of the colossal fortune upon which he had, as it were,\r\nstumbled. Though I sincerely wished my poor sick neighbor might succeed\r\nin his enterprise, I gradually grew restless and morose. The opal-mine\r\nbecame a painful and distasteful topic of conversation, and as Arthur\r\ninvariably adverted to it in some way or other, I by degrees made my\r\nvisits of shorter and shorter duration.\r\n\r\n'In vain I strove to divert my mind from this one absorbing idea. I\r\nvisited the theatres, attended cock-pits and bull-fights, in the hope\r\nthat the excitement would afford me relief from the fascinating spell:\r\nbut it was useless, I was a haunted man.\r\n\r\n'One night, returning from the opera, at about ten o'clock, I was\r\nstopped by a large crowd at the corner of the Calle Plateros. From an\r\nofficer near me, I ascertained that a foreigner, believed to be a\r\nheretic, had been stabbed, and was either dead or dying.\r\n\r\n'The next morning, in the _Diario de Gobierno_, which Donna Teresa\r\nbrought up with my chocolate, I learned that 'at about ten on the\r\nprevious night, an American, named Percival, recently arrived from\r\nNew-Orleans, was murdered in the Calle Plateros.' His watch and purse\r\nwere missing; it was therefore inferred that robbery and not revenge had\r\nprompted the foul deed.\r\n\r\n'I instantly summoned Donna Teresa, and requested her to take the paper,\r\nwhich I marked, to Mr. Livermore; and as soon as my breakfast was over,\r\nI hastened to make my usual call. I found him looking very sombre.\r\n\r\n''God is my witness!' he exclaimed, the instant I entered the room,\r\n'that I did not seek this poor unfortunate man's death; but it relieves\r\nAdéle from all fear. Have you heard any details of the event?'\r\n\r\n''I have not; but assassination is not so rare here that you need be\r\nunder any fear about it. No suspicion can possibly attach to you.'\r\n\r\n''I have no fear, for I know my own innocence; but it is inexplicable to\r\nme. Poor Percival! he could have had no enemy in the city.'\r\n\r\n''Doubtless he was murdered for his money and his watch; but have you\r\nheard from Toluca?'\r\n\r\n''Yes, and Adéle informs me that I may expect Pepito in the course of\r\nthe day. So I shall not delay my departure beyond to-morrow, perhaps\r\nto-night. But there is some one at the door; doubtless it is Pepito.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Livermore opened the door; but instead of Pepito it was his friend,\r\nPedro, who entered.\r\n\r\n''My presence surprises you, Caballero,' said Pedro, drawing a long\r\nsigh; 'but alas! I have bad news.'\r\n\r\n'What! bad news? speak, speak, quick!' exclaimed Arthur, turning\r\ndeadly pale.\r\n\r\n'Pedro, before deigning to answer, drew forth a very soiled rag, which\r\nserved him as a handkerchief, and proceeded to rub his eyes with no\r\nlittle vigor, a pantomime which was intended no doubt to convey the idea\r\nof tears having dimmed his eyes.\r\n\r\n''Alas! Excellency,' said he at length, in a lugubrious tone; 'poor\r\nPepito is in sad trouble.'\r\n\r\n''Have you been fighting again? Have you killed him?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n''Killed him? _I_ kill him!' he repeated indignantly; 'how can you\r\nimagine such an outrage, Caballero? Kill my best friend! No, Señor; but\r\npoor Pepito has been pressed into a military company. To-morrow, they\r\nwill uniform him and march him off to some frontier regiment.'\r\n\r\n''Is there no way of buying him off?' inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n''Nothing more easy, Caballero. You have simply to write to the General\r\nwho commands the department, and state that Pepito is attached to your\r\nperson, as a personal attendant, and that will suffice to set him at\r\nliberty. They never press people in service.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Livermore lost no time in following Pedro's advice. As soon as the\r\nletter was handed to him, the latter waved it in triumph over his head,\r\nand rushed forth to effect the deliverance of his dear compadre, Pepito.\r\n\r\n'The impressment of Pepito surprised me, for I had not heard of their\r\ntaking any body who had reached the dignity of a pair of inexpressibles,\r\nand the luxury of a pair of shoes. The Indians in the neighborhood of\r\nthe capital, besotted by drink and misery, almost naked, and living or\r\nrather burrowing in caves, were usually the only victims of the\r\nrecruiting sergeant. However, as the letter given by Arthur to Pedro\r\ncould be of no use to the latter, I saw no reasonable ground to doubt\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n'As it seemed probable that Mr. Livermore would shortly leave the city,\r\nI accepted his invitation, and promised to return and dine with him at\r\nfive o'clock, adding that I hoped then to meet Pepito, and receive from\r\nhim a full account of his adventures since we had parted.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n'About three o'clock, I returned home. I had ensconced myself, book in\r\nhand, in my rocking-chair, when groans which seemed to proceed from Mr.\r\nLivermore's room, attracted my attention. I listened at the door, and my\r\nfears were realized. The groans were assuredly uttered by my neighbor. I\r\nrushed into his room, and as I crossed toward his bed, a fearful\r\nspectacle met my gaze.\r\n\r\n'Lying across the bed, his face livid, every muscle in motion, a prey to\r\nthe most violent convulsions, I saw my unfortunate fellow-countryman. No\r\nsooner, however, did the noise of my entrance fall upon his ear, than he\r\nsummoned strength enough to rise, and seizing a pistol that was beside\r\nhim, pointed it at me.\r\n\r\n''Ah! it is you?' said he, lowering his weapon, and falling back, 'you\r\nhave arrived just in time to see me die.'\r\n\r\n''Take courage, my friend; for heaven's sake, be of good cheer. It is\r\nonly one of your usual attacks, and will pass off; there is no danger.'\r\n\r\n''No danger!' repeated the unfortunate sufferer, biting the sheet and\r\nstriving to stifle the cry which agony drew from him; 'no danger? why, I\r\nam poisoned!'\r\n\r\n''Poisoned! you must be mad,' I exclaimed: but without loss of time, I\r\nsummoned Donna Lopez, and sent instantly for a doctor, who fortunately\r\nlived within a few doors of our house.\r\n\r\n'Once more alone with Arthur, I inquired, during a momentary cessation\r\nof his sufferings:\r\n\r\n''What reason have you for thinking you are poisoned?'\r\n\r\n''I am _sure_ of it,' he replied. 'About an hour since, I received a\r\nvisit from the Mexican General who is superintendent of the recruiting\r\nservice. He desired me to give him certain explanations relative to\r\nPepito, which, of course, I did. It was very warm, and he asked for a\r\nglass of iced water. I offered him some claret to mix with it, and, at\r\nhis request, joined him in the drink. But a few moments elapsed after I\r\nhad taken my draught, when I felt a weakness steal over me; my eyelids\r\ngrew heavy, my knees gave way, and an intolerable heat burned my veins.\r\nI was compelled to sit down upon my bed. At that moment, the General\r\nchanged his tone, and imperiously demanded the key of my desk. 'I do not\r\nwant your money,' he said, 'but I must have the papers relative to the\r\nopal-mine.' I can not express the effect these words produced upon me.\r\n'To deal frankly with you,' continued the General, 'you are poisoned,\r\nand the Indian poison that is now coursing through your veins has no\r\nantidote. Ten minutes, and your strength will begin to fail; two hours,\r\nand your earthly career will end. If you do not at once give me your\r\nkeys, I shall force the lock.' These words, which he doubtless thought\r\nwould crush me, filled me with boundless rage, and for a few moments\r\nrevived my sinking energies. I started to my feet, and seized my\r\nrevolver.'\r\n\r\n'''The devil! it seems the dose was not strong enough,' exclaimed my\r\nassassin, taking flight; 'but I will return, be sure of that.''\r\n\r\n'The doctor soon arrived. At the first glance at the patient, he knit\r\nhis brow, and his countenance became overcast.\r\n\r\n''How long have you been ill?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n''I was poisoned, about an hour since.'\r\n\r\n''Ah! you know you have been poisoned?'\r\n\r\n''Yes, doctor, and also the man who poisoned me. Tell me, I beseech you,\r\nhow long I have to live? Speak! you need have no fear; I am prepared for\r\nthe worst.'\r\n\r\n'The doctor hesitated, and then said: 'I fear, my dear sir, another hour\r\nis all you can hope for.'\r\n\r\n''I thank you, doctor, for your frankness. No antidote, then, can save\r\nme?'\r\n\r\n''None. The poison you have taken, which the Indians call '_Leche de\r\npalo_,' is deadly. Your present sufferings will soon cease, and\r\ngradually you will sink, peacefully and painlessly, into the sleep of\r\ndeath.'\r\n\r\n''Send instantly, then, for a magistrate. I at least will be revenged on\r\nmy murderer,' said Arthur, 'let me at once make my statement.'\r\n\r\n''You will only be wasting your dying moments,' interposed the doctor;\r\n'day after day, I am called upon to witness the ravages of this\r\ninsidious poison, but never yet has the scaffold punished the assassin.\r\nMy dear friend, think not of your murderer; eternity is opening to\r\nreceive you; in its solemn presence, mere human vengeance shrinks into\r\nutter nothingness.'\r\n\r\n''Doctor, you speak wisely as well as kindly. Poor Adéle,' murmured\r\nArthur, and his eyes closed, though his lips still moved.\r\n\r\n'After the doctor's departure, I sent to the American Legation, urgently\r\nrequesting some official to return with my messenger. I took a chair\r\nbeside the bed, while Donna Teresa knelt in the adjoining room, and\r\nprayed and sobbed with much fervor. In a short while, Arthur rallied\r\nfrom the stupor into which he had fallen. His features became calm, his\r\nbreathing regular though feeble, and the tranquil, almost happy,\r\nexpression of his eye made me for a time half doubt the fearful\r\nprediction of the physician.\r\n\r\n''Do you feel better?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n''Much much; I am in no pain.'\r\n\r\n''Let us hope, then, for the best. I will send for another doctor.'\r\n\r\n''No, that would be useless. My lower extremities are swelling, and I\r\ncan feel the hand of death clutching at my vitals. The doctor was\r\nright; death is not racking me with torture, it is gently embracing me.\r\nBut I want your assistance; sit down.'\r\n\r\n'I resumed my seat, and Arthur continued, in a feeble tone, but\r\nperfectly calm:\r\n\r\n''How mean a thing is life! Good God! so mean, that at this moment I can\r\nnot explain to my own soul why man should cling to it. What do we meet\r\nduring our short career? Deceit, hypocrisy, and treachery. Ah! death\r\nreveals the hollowness of life.'\r\n\r\n''My dear friend, you are exhausting yourself. Did you not say you wanted\r\nmy assistance? Rely on my zeal, my fidelity, and my discretion.'\r\n\r\n''Rely on you! How can I tell? You are only a man; perhaps avaricious and\r\ntreacherous as your fellow-mortals. No matter; though you should\r\nforswear yourself; I, at least, will do what is right. Feel beneath my\r\npillow, there is a key; take it, open my desk. In the small drawer on\r\nthe left is a package of letters. Have you them? Good. Next to that\r\nthere is a sealed letter. Now, read aloud the direction on each.'\r\n\r\n''Papers to be burnt after my death,' said I, obeying his injunction.\r\n\r\n''Well, what do you intend doing with them?'\r\n\r\n''Can you for one moment doubt?' I replied.\r\n\r\n'What if I should tell you they contain the entire secret of my\r\nopal-mine!'\r\n\r\n'I made no reply; but struck a match against the wall, and setting them\r\non fire, resumed my seat.\r\n\r\n''I could hardly have believed it; but you still have Pepito; from him\r\nyou hope to learn the secret,' said the dying man.\r\n\r\n''Shall I bind myself by an oath not to seek him?'\r\n\r\n''No; I leave you at liberty. Act as you think best. I burned those\r\npapers because they were bought with blood, for no other reason.'\r\n\r\n''Bought with blood?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n''Yes; ten months ago, General Ramiro died at New-Orleans, by\r\npoison--poison administered by Adéle. Do you wonder life has lost all\r\ncharm for me? Oh! life is the bitterness, not death.'\r\n\r\n'His voice momently grew fainter. I leaned closer, to catch his fading\r\ntones, till he ceased to speak. I gazed intently at his glassy eyes; the\r\nlids closed for a moment, then partially opened, the jaw fell, and he\r\nwas no more.'\r\n\r\n'I know not how long I had stood beside his lifeless body, pondering\r\nover the uncertainty of life, and the mystery of death, and the\r\nconflicting presentiments he had uttered: that he should live to achieve\r\nsuccess, yet die without again seeing her who had lured him to his\r\nwretched end, when the door of the chamber suddenly opened, and five or\r\nsix dragoons entered, accompanied by an officer in undress uniform.\r\n\r\n''What! you here, General?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n''Why not?' was the cool reply, 'I am in search of a deserter named\r\nPepito, who, I was informed, was concealed here. I see he is not here;\r\nbut doubtless by searching among the papers contained in this desk, I\r\nshall find some clue to him.'\r\n\r\n''Your search, General, will be fruitless. The unfortunate young man\r\nwhose corpse lies here, instructed me, before he expired, to burn all\r\nthe papers in his possession, and I have obeyed his injunctions.'\r\n\r\n''Curses on his infernal obstinacy!' exclaimed General Valiente, 'but\r\nlook you, Señor, I tell you I will search this desk.'\r\n\r\n''By what right?'\r\n\r\n''By the right of might.'\r\n\r\n'Taking my stand in front of the desk, I was protesting against the\r\nlawless act of violence, when the Secretary of the American Legation\r\nfortunately arrived. Finding his plans defeated, Valiente, with\r\ncommendable prudence, decided on beating a retreat, and with his\r\nfollowers, took rather an abrupt departure.\r\n\r\n'The ordinary formalities of attaching the seals of the Legation having\r\nbeen performed, and having secured a faithful person to take charge of\r\nthe remains of the unfortunate Livermore, I sallied forth to make\r\narrangements to leave, as soon as possible, for Toluca.\r\n\r\nThe first person I met was Pedro. It is impossible to express the horror\r\nI felt of this villain. My hand was on my weapon before he had reached\r\nmy side.\r\n\r\n''Have you heard the news, Caballero?' said he, in a low, mysterious\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n''No.'\r\n\r\n''I was not fortunate enough to release Pepito; when I arrived with his\r\nmaster's letter, he had already escaped from the barracks.'\r\n\r\n''Tell me frankly, Pedro, did not General Valiente send you, this\r\nmorning, for that letter?'\r\n\r\n''Why? What makes you ask?' inquired Pedro, quite disconcerted by the\r\nabruptness of my question.\r\n\r\n''Because Señor Pride is dead, and General Valiente has twice been to\r\nhis rooms.'\r\n\r\n''Dead! Señor Pride dead!' echoed Pedro, in unfeigned astonishment.\r\n'Caballero, I must be off.' And he instantly turned away, and was soon\r\nlost to my sight.\r\n\r\n'Before another hour had passed I was on horseback and on the way to\r\nToluca. The road was infested by gangs of robbers, but my pockets were\r\nempty, and my brain was full, so I gave those gentry not even a passing\r\nthought. The evening was fast closing in, and as the shadows gathered\r\nround me, the tragic event which I had just witnessed gradually receded\r\nfrom my mind. As I journeyed on, it grew more and more distant, until at\r\nlast it faded into a dim memory of the past; and through the long miles\r\nof my lonely ride there went before me the glorious vision of an\r\nopal-mine of untold wealth--an opal-mine without an owner--a countless\r\nfortune, untold riches, waiting to fall into my hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n'It was past midnight when I reached Toluca. As it was too late to call\r\non Adéle, I alighted at a tavern, where I passed the night, pacing my\r\nchamber, and not closing my eyes. Soon after daybreak I sought the house\r\nof Pepito's sister; and notwithstanding the earliness of the hour, found\r\nMrs. Percival standing at one of the windows.\r\n\r\n''You here, Mr. Rideau!' she exclaimed, with surprise, on seeing me.\r\n'How did you find my retreat?'\r\n\r\n''I was told of it by Mr. Livermore.'\r\n\r\n''Ah! 'tis he who sent you.'\r\n\r\n''Alas! not so, madame.'\r\n\r\n''Alas!--you say, alas! What do you mean? Have you ill news?'\r\n\r\n''I have, indeed, madame.'\r\n\r\n''Arthur is dead!' she cried. 'I know he is dead! But, tell me, I\r\nentreat you, tell me all. How--when did this happen?'\r\n\r\n'I gave her a detailed account of Arthur's death, to which she listened\r\nwith rapt attention.\r\n\r\n''This opal-mine, like the Golden Fleece, brings misfortune to all who\r\nseek it,' she said, when I had finished, 'Poor Arthur! I loved him\r\nfondly, devotedly; and his image will live forever in my heart. But at\r\nsuch a crisis it is worse than folly--it is madness to waste time by\r\ngiving way to grief. Reason teaches us to bow before the inevitable. It\r\nis idle to repine at the decrees of Fate. I am alone, now--alone,\r\nwithout a friend or a protector. No matter; I have a stout heart, and\r\nthe mercy of Providence is above all. But to business: After the death\r\nof Mr. Livermore, what became of the papers?'\r\n\r\n''I burned them before his death, in obedience to his injunctions.'\r\n\r\n''You burned them! I will not believe it!' she exclaimed, in a loud\r\nvoice, and with a penetrating glance.\r\n\r\n'I felt the blood rush to my face; she noticed my anger, and at once\r\nadded, in milder tone:\r\n\r\n''Pardon me! pardon me! I knew not what I said; I am well-nigh crazy; I\r\ndo believe you, I do indeed; forgive me, and think of the despair to\r\nwhich the loss of those papers reduces me. I have no copy, and with them\r\nmy secret perishes. I am ruined--ruined irretrievably. The mine is\r\nknown now only to Pepito!'\r\n\r\n''Then, madame, on him you must hereafter rely.'\r\n\r\n''Explain to me, pray, how could Arthur, on his dying-bed, have been\r\nguilty of so cruel, so mean an act? How could he despoil the woman who\r\nhad trusted him, and leave her not only forlorn, but destitute?'\r\n\r\n'This question embarrassed me, and I was conning an answer, when Adéle\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n''Let no false delicacy restrain you; speak out, Mr. Rideau; adversity\r\nhas taught me endurance, if not courage.'\r\n\r\n''Since, madame, you absolutely extort it from me, I must admit that a\r\nfew moments before he expired, Mr. Livermore--'\r\n\r\n''Speak out, plainly; I beg of you, conceal nothing.'\r\n\r\n''Well, madame, the words he used were: 'I destroy these papers because\r\nthey were bought with blood. Ten months ago General Ramiro died, at\r\nNew-Orleans, by poison--poison administered by Adéle!''\r\n\r\n''Poor Arthur! what agony he must have suffered--he must have been\r\ndelirious. O Arthur! why was I not beside you? Poor Arthur!' As she\r\nuttered these words, she raised her streaming eyes to heaven; her lips\r\nmoved as if in prayer, and a deadly pallor overspread her countenance.\r\n\r\n'In a short time her fortitude returned, and turning toward me, she\r\nsaid, in a voice which betrayed no emotion:\r\n\r\n''Let us turn from the past and look at the present. Difficulties\r\nsurround and threaten to overwhelm me. Before I can determine how they\r\nare to be met, I have a proposition to make to you, Mr. Rideau, to which\r\nI must have an immediate answer. Will you become my partner in this\r\nbusiness?'\r\n\r\n''Have you enough confidence in me?'\r\n\r\n''I have; and for this reason: you have not sought to meddle in this\r\nmatter, but from the outset have striven to shun it; you have not\r\nobtruded yourself, but been drawn into it in spite of your wishes. Do\r\nyou accept my proposition? Yes, or no?'\r\n\r\n''I accept,' I replied, moderating my joyful feelings as well as I\r\npossibly could.\r\n\r\n''Such being your decision, what course do you advise?'\r\n\r\n''Immediate action, for minutes are precious.'\r\n\r\n''I foresee we shall agree perfectly. To-day my host purposes starting\r\nfor the capital; I shall accompany him. If you return without delay, the\r\nremainder of the day will suffice to prepare for the journey, and\r\nto-morrow we will start for the opal-mine.'\r\n\r\n''But where shall I meet you, madame?'\r\n\r\n''At the Hotel de las Diligencias.'\r\n\r\n''And where shall I find Pepito?'\r\n\r\n''At a tavern near the Barrier del Nino Perdido. But you will not, if\r\nyou please, inform him of my address. For--well, it is an unpleasant\r\nmatter to mention--but this Pepito seems to be--'\r\n\r\n''Desperately in love with you.'\r\n\r\n''I hardly meant that--but his attentions are too oppressive to be quite\r\nagreeable.'\r\n\r\n''I fully understand you, madame. May I inquire if you have had any\r\ntidings of Mr. Percival?'\r\n\r\n''Do not, I beg, Mr. Rideau, allude to that painful topic--all feelings\r\nof resentment are hushed in the grave.'\r\n\r\n''What! have you heard of his assassination?'\r\n\r\n'' Yes; the news reached me yesterday; I read it in the newspaper.'\r\n\r\n'I shortly afterward took my leave--the last words of my new copartner\r\nbeing:\r\n\r\n''At five, then, at the Hotel de las Diligencias. Be sure you are\r\npunctual.'\r\n\r\n'Arrived in Mexico, my first thought was to seek for Pepito. Following\r\nthe directions given me by Mrs. Percival, I soon found him; and\r\nrepeating to him a portion of the interview I had with the lady, I\r\nfinished by proposing to take the place of Mr. Livermore in the bargain\r\nthat had been made between them.\r\n\r\n''I ask nothing better,' was the reply. 'Here are my terms--two thousand\r\ndollars the very day we return to Mexico, and I to hold the shells till\r\nyou hand over the money. That is fair, is it not?'\r\n\r\n''Quite. When shall I see you again?'\r\n\r\n''At eight to-night, on the Cathedral steps.'\r\n\r\n'Hastening home, I devoted the rest of the day to preparing for my\r\njourney, and a little before five started for the Hotel de las\r\nDiligencias. Mrs. Percival had not yet arrived. Twice again I called,\r\nbut still in vain. The evening gradually wore away, and at eight I paced\r\nthe Cathedral Square, and for an hour loitered around the steps; but\r\nPepito, also, failed to keep the rendezvous.\r\n\r\n'As the next day was Sunday, I felt assured the most likely place to\r\nfind Pepito, would be the bull-ring. On reaching it, I found a crowd\r\nassembled near one of the entrances, and pushing my way through, I\r\nbeheld Pepito lying on the ground weltering in his blood. I rushed to\r\nhim, and kneeling down, raised him in my arms.\r\n\r\n''Ah! it is you, Señor,' said he, in a feeble tone. 'This is Pedro's\r\nwork, but it was his last; for I have killed the traitor.'\r\n\r\n''Pepito, tell me, for Heaven's sake, where did you find the shells?'I\r\ninquired; for avarice and cupidity reigned, I am ashamed to own,\r\nparamount within my breast.\r\n\r\n''Those shells? In the plains of Chiapa--three days' journey from the\r\nsea--near the little river--in a brook--Ah! glory to God! here comes a\r\npriest!'\r\n\r\n'At this moment a fat Franciscan friar pressed through the crowd.\r\n\r\n''Absolution, padre! absolution!' cried Pepito, to whom the sight of the\r\nfriar brought back new life.\r\n\r\n''Patience, my son, patience! I am very late--very late--and I must not\r\nbe detained. Wait a little--and after the sports of the day are over, I\r\nwill return.'\r\n\r\n''But, padre, I shall be dead!'\r\n\r\n''Well, then, be quick!'\r\n\r\n''I have only two sins on my conscience: I have not attended mass for\r\nthree weeks.'\r\n\r\n''That is sad! very sad! Well, what next?'\r\n\r\n''Three days ago I stabbed an Inglez--a heretic.'\r\n\r\n''Well, my dear son, your sins are venial sins; I absolve you.'\r\n\r\n''Pepito, how did that dagger come into your hands?' I exclaimed, for I\r\nwas astonished to see in his belt the dagger I had lost on the night\r\nwhen Adéle took refuge in my room.\r\n\r\n''From my dear--Adéle.'\r\n\r\n''And the _Inglez_--the heretic you stabbed--who was he?'\r\n\r\n''Her husband--she wished it--promised to be mine--and I obeyed. But,\r\nstand back--I want air--air.'\r\n\r\n'I turned away my head, sickened at the fearful revelation. When I again\r\nlooked, my eyes fell on a corpse. I snatched the dagger, which was still\r\nwet with Pedro's blood, from his belt, and hurried almost frantic to the\r\nHotel de las Diligencias. Mrs. Percival had been waiting for me about\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\n'The violent emotions which raged within me must have been portrayed on\r\nmy countenance, for on my entering the apartment, she started back in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n''Mrs. Percival,' said I, striving to master the repulsive feeling which\r\nthe mere sight of her excited, 'Pepito has, within the past hour, been\r\nmurdered.'\r\n\r\n''Murdered!' she repeated. 'And the secret--'\r\n\r\n''Is dead--for _you_--forever! Madame, that infernal mine has for years\r\nbeen driving you to the blackest crime! It is time that the bait fell\r\nfrom the devil's hook.'\r\n\r\n''What do you mean by this altered tone?'\r\n\r\n''I mean, madame, that, thanks to Heaven, your crimes have been revealed\r\nto me. Shall I enumerate the list of your victims--General Ramiro,\r\nArthur Livermore, Edward Percival, your husband, and last of all,\r\nPepito? Your path, since you have sought this mine, is marked at every\r\nstep by treachery and crime. The boldest heart must shudder to look at\r\nthe ghastly procession led on by the General you poisoned.'\r\n\r\n'''Tis false! God help me, 'tis false!'\r\n\r\n''False--_is_ it false--that three days since your husband was murdered\r\nat your instigation, by Pepito? Stay--hear me! Look at this dagger! did\r\nyou not steal it from my room and give it to Pepito to perpetrate the\r\ncrime? Madame, pause, ere you dare to swear it is false.'\r\n\r\n'She trembled, and falling on her knees, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n''My God! my God! forgive me!'\r\n\r\n''It is not, madame, for erring man to limit the infinite mercy of\r\nHeaven; but for such crimes as yours there must be a fearful\r\nretribution. Farewell; may you go and sin no more.'\r\n\r\n'I left the room, but in a few moments heard a piercing shriek; and\r\nrushing back, found the wretched woman extended on the floor in the\r\nagonies of death. She had picked up the dagger which I had thrown away,\r\nand stabbed herself to the heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'And the opal-mine?'\r\n\r\n'I meant, at first, to leave the Nibelungen Hoard alone; but time tames\r\nall things except the love of gold. I went there; it was rich, but not\r\ninexhaustible. You have all had proof that I am neither poor nor\r\nparsimonious; but neither am I extravagant. I have all that I want--a\r\ncottage at Newport, a neat house in the Rue de la Paix, stocks, and real\r\nestate. The opal-mine started me; I have kept myself going very well\r\never since.\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, my tale is ended. I am sorry it has proved so long, and am\r\ngrateful to you all for the attentive hearing you have given me. I have\r\nbeen constantly looking round expecting to detect some one of you\r\nfalling into a gentle slumber; I therefore feel really flattered at\r\nfinding you all still awake.'\r\n\r\n'But what became of the child that Percival was seeking?' shouted one.\r\n\r\n'Did you ever find out any thing about Adéle's previous history?' asked\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n'And look here, Rideau, what did you--?'\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, take pity on me; while I have been spinning this long yarn,\r\nyou have been smoking and imbibing; I am very willing to join you in\r\nboth; but to-night I am tired out. The next time we meet, I shall be\r\ndelighted to tell you what particulars I learned on my return to New\r\nOrleans, relative to Adéle and her poor orphan child; but no more\r\nto-night.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE._\r\n\r\n  Red was the lightning's flashing,\r\n    And down through the driving rain,\r\n  We saw the red eyes dashing\r\n    Of the merciless midnight train;\r\n  Soon many crowded together,\r\n    Under the lamp's red glow,\r\n  But I saw one figure only--\r\n    Ah! why did I tremble so?\r\n  The eyes that gazed in the darkness\r\n    After the midnight train,\r\n  Are red with watching and weeping,\r\n    For it brings none back again.\r\n  Clouds hang in the west like banners,\r\n    Red banners of war unfurled,\r\n  And the prairie sod is crimson\r\n    With the best blood of the world.\r\n\r\n  White faces are pressed to the window,\r\n    Watching the sun go down,\r\n  Looking out to the coming darkness,\r\n    That covers the noisy town.\r\n  White are the hands, too, and quiet,\r\n    Over the pulseless breast;\r\n  No more will the vision of parting\r\n    Disturb the white sleeper's rest.\r\n  Over sleeper, and grave, and tombstone,\r\n    Like a pitying mantle spread,\r\n  The snow comes down in the night-time,\r\n    With a shy and noiseless tread.\r\n\r\n  Blue smoke rolls away on the north-wind,\r\n    Blue skies grow dusk in the din,\r\n  Blue waters look dark with the shadow\r\n    That gathers the world within.\r\n  Rigid and blue are the fingers\r\n    That clutch at the fading sky;\r\n  Blue lips in their agony mutter:\r\n    'O God! let this cup pass by.'\r\n  Blue eyes grow weary with watching;\r\n    Strong hands with waiting to do;\r\n  While brave hearts echo the watchword:\r\n    'Hurrah! for the Red, White, and Blue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MACCARONI AND CANVAS._\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FAIR AT GROTTO FERRATA.\r\n\r\nNo matter how well and hearty you may be, if you are in Rome, in summer,\r\nwhen the _scirócco_ blows, you will feel as if convalescent from some\r\ndebilitating fever; in winter, however, this gentle-breathing south-east\r\nwind will act more mildly; it will woo you to the country, induce you to\r\nsit down in a shady place, smoke, and 'muse.' That incarnate essence of\r\nenterprise, business, industry, economy, sharpness, shrewdness, and\r\nkeenness--that Prometheus whose liver was torn by the vulture of cent\r\nper cent--eternally tossing, restless DOOLITTLE, was one day seen\r\nasleep, during bank hours, on a seat in the Villa Madama. The _scirócco_\r\nblew that day: Doolittle fell.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, one morning in the latter part of the month of March,\r\nCaper proposed to Roejean and another artist named Bagswell, to attend\r\nthe fair held that day at Grotto Ferrata.\r\n\r\n'What will you find there?' asked Roejean.\r\n\r\n'Find?--I remember, in the _Bohemian Girl_, a song that will answer\r\nyou,' replied Caper; 'the words were composed by the theatrical poet\r\nBunn':\r\n\r\n  'Rank, in its halls, may not find\r\n  The calm of a happy mind;\r\n      So repair\r\n      To the Fair,\r\n  And they may be met with there.'\r\n\r\n'Unsatisfactory, both the grammar and the sentiment,' said Bagswell; 'it\r\nwon't work; it's all wrong. In the first place, rank, in its hauls,\r\n_may_ find the calm of a happy mind: for instance, the captain of a\r\nherring-smack may find the calm of a very happy mind in his hauls of No.\r\n1 Digbys; more joy even than the fair could afford him. Let us go!'\r\n\r\nBagswell was a 'funny' Englishman.\r\n\r\nThey went--taking the railroad. Dashing out of the station, the\r\nlocomotive carried them, in half an hour, to the station at Frascati,\r\nwhirling them across the Campagna, past long lines of ruined or\r\nhalf-ruined and repaired aqueducts; past Roman tombs; past _Roma\r\nVecchia_, the name given to the ruins of an immense villa; landing them\r\nat the first slope of the mountains, covered at their base with\r\nvineyards, olive and fruit-trees, and corn-fields, while high over them\r\ngleamed glistening white snow-peaks.\r\n\r\nThe walk from Frascati to the Grotto, about three miles, was beautiful,\r\nwinding over hills through a fine wood of huge old elms and plane-trees.\r\nIn the warm sun-light, the butterflies were flitting, while the\r\nroad-side was purple with violets, and white and blue with little\r\nflowers. From time to time, our three artists had glimpses of the\r\nCampagna, rolling away like the ocean, to dash on Rome, crowned by St.\r\nPeter's; the dome of which church towers above the surrounding country,\r\nso that it can be seen, far and wide, for thirty miles or more. The road\r\nwas alive with walkers and riders; here a dashing, open carriage, filled\r\nwith rosy English; there a _contadino_, donkey-back, dressed in\r\nholiday-suit, with short-clothes of blue woolen, a scarlet waistcoat,\r\nhis coarse blue-cloth jacket worn on one shoulder, and in his brown,\r\nconical-shaped hat, a large carnation-pink. Then came more of the\r\ncountry-people, almost always called _villani_, (hence our word,\r\nvillains!) These poor villains had sacks on their backs, or were\r\ncarrying in their hands--if women, on their heads--loads of bacon, sides\r\nof bacon, flitches of bacon, hams, loaves of bread, cheese, and very\r\nloud-smelling _mortadella_; which they had bought and were bringing away\r\nfrom the fair.\r\n\r\n'There was one task,' said Roejean, 'that Hercules declined, and that\r\nwas eating that vile _mortadella_. He was a strong man; but that was\r\nstronger. Wait a moment, till I fill a pipe with caporal, and have a\r\nsmoke; for if I meet another man with that delicacy, I shall have to\r\ngive up the Grotto--unless I have a pipe under my nose, as\r\ncounter-irritant.'\r\n\r\nThe three artists tramped along gayly, until they approached the town,\r\nwhen they assumed the proud, disdainful mood, assuring spectators that\r\nthey who wear it are of gentle blood, and are tired of life and weary of\r\ntraveling around with pockets filled with gold. They only looked coldly\r\nat the pens filled with cattle for sale; long-horned, mouse-colored oxen\r\nwere there; groups of patient donkeys, or the rough-maned,\r\nshaggy-fetlocked, bright-eyed small horses of the Campagna; countless\r\npigs, many goats; while above all, the loud-singing jackasses were\r\nperforming at the top of their lungs. Here were knots of country-people,\r\nbuying provisions or clothing; there were groups of carriages from Rome,\r\nwhich had rolled out the wealthy _forestieri_ or strangers, drawn up by\r\nthe way-side, in the midst of all sorts and kinds of hucksters. The road\r\nleading to the church, shaded by trees, was crowded with country-people,\r\nin picturesque costumes, busily engaged in buying and selling hams,\r\nbacon, bacon and hams, and a few more hams. Here and there, a\r\ncheese-stand languished, for pork flourished. Now a copper-smith exposed\r\nhis wares, chief among which were the graceful-shaped _conche_ or\r\nwater-vessels, the same you see so carefully poised on the heads of so\r\nmany black-eyed Italian girls, going to or coming from so many\r\npicturesque fountains, in--paintings, and all wearing such brilliant\r\ncostumes, as you find at--Gigi's costume-class. Then came an ironmonger,\r\nwhose wares were all made by hand, even the smallest nails; for\r\nmachinery, as yet, is in its first infancy around Rome. At this stand,\r\nRoejean stopped to purchase a pallet-knife; not one of the regular,\r\nartist-made tools, but a thin, pliable piece of steel, without handle,\r\nwhich experience taught him was well adapted to his work. As usual, the\r\niron-man asked twice as much as he intended to take, and after a sharp\r\nbargain, Roejean conquered. Then they came to a stand where there were\r\npiles of coarse crockery, and some of a better kind, of classical shape.\r\n\r\nCaper particularly admired a beautiful white jug, intended for a\r\nwater-pitcher, and holding about two gallons. After asking its price, he\r\noffered a quarter of the money for it; to Bagswell's horror, the\r\ncrockery-man took it, and Caper, passing his arm through the handle, was\r\nproceeding up the road, when Bagswell energetically asked him what he\r\nwas going to do with it.\r\n\r\n'Enter Rome with it, like Titus with the _spolia opima_,' replied Caper.\r\n\r\n'Oh! I say, now,' said the former, who was an Englishman and an\r\nhistorical painter; 'you aren't going to trot all over the fair with\r\nthat old crockery on your arm. Why, God bless me, they'll swear we are\r\ndrunk. There comes the Duchess of Brodneck; what the deuce will she\r\nsay?'\r\n\r\n'Say?' said Caper, 'why, I'll go and ask her; this is not court-day.'\r\n\r\nWithout another word, with water-pitcher on arm, he walked toward the\r\nDuchess. Saluting her with marked politeness, he said:\r\n\r\n'A countryman of yours, madame, has objected to my carrying this _objet\r\nde fantaisie_, assuring me that it would occasion remarks from the\r\nDuchess of Brodneck. May I have the good fortune to know what she says\r\nof it?'\r\n\r\n'She says,' replied the lady, smiling and speaking slowly and quietly;\r\n'that a young man who has independence enough to carry it, has\r\nconfidence enough to--fill it.' She bowed, and passed on, Caper politely\r\nraising his hat, in acknowledgment of the well-rounded sentence. When he\r\nreturned to Bagswell, he found the historical painter with eyes the size\r\nof grape-shot, at the sublime impudence of the man. He told him what\r\nshe had said.\r\n\r\n'Upon my honor, you Americans have a face of brass; to address a duchess\r\nyou don't know, and ask her a question like that!'\r\n\r\n'That's nothing,' said Caper, 'a little experience has taught me that\r\nthe higher you fly, in England, the nearer you approach true politeness\r\nand courtesy. Believe me, I should never have asked that question of any\r\nEnglishwoman whose social position did not assure me she was\r\ncosmopolitan.'\r\n\r\n'Come,' said Bagswell, 'come, after such an adventure, if there is one\r\ndrop of any thing fit to drink in this town, we'll all go and get\r\nlushy.'\r\n\r\nThey went. They found a door over which hung a green branch. Good wine\r\nneeds no bush, therefore Italian wine-shops hang it out; for the wine\r\nthere is not over good. But as luck was with our three artists, in the\r\nshop over the door of which hung the green bough, they found that the\r\n_padrone_ was an old acquaintance of Roejean; he had married and moved\r\nto Grotto Ferrata. He had a barrel of Frascati wine, which was bright,\r\nsparkling, sweet, and not watered. This the _padrone_ tapped in honor of\r\nhis guests, and at their urgent request, sat down and helped empty a\r\ncouple of bottles. Moreover, he told them that as the town was\r\novercrowded, they would find it difficult to get a good dinner, unless\r\nthey would come and dine with him, at his private table, and be his\r\nguests; which invitation Roejean accepted, to the tavern-keeper's great\r\njoy, promising to be back at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nOur trio then sauntered forth to see the fair. Wandering among the\r\ncrowded booths, they came suddenly on a collection of _Zingare_, looking\r\nlike their Spanish cousins, the _Gitañas_. Wild black eyes, coarse black\r\nlocks of hair, brown as Indians, small hands, small feet--the Gipsies,\r\nchildren of the storm--my Rommani pals, what are you doing here? Only\r\none woman among them was noticeable. Her face was startlingly handsome,\r\nwith an aquiline nose, thin nostrils, beautifully-arched eyebrows, and\r\neyes like an eagle. She was tall, straight, with exquisitely-rounded\r\nfigure, and the full drapery of white around her bosom fell from the\r\nshoulders in large hanging sleeves; over her head was thrown a crimson\r\nand green shawl, folded like the _pane_ of the _ciociare_, and setting\r\noff her raven-black hair and rich red and swarthy complexion.\r\n\r\nRoejean stood entranced, and Caper, noticing his rapt air, forbore\r\nbreaking silence; while the gipsy, who knew that she was the admiration\r\nof the _forestieri_, stood immovable as a statue, looking steadily at\r\nthem, without changing a feature.\r\n\r\n'_Piu bellisima che la madonna!_' said Roejean, loud enough for her to\r\nhear. Then turning to Caper, 'Let's _andiammo_,' (travel,) said he,\r\n'that woman's face will haunt me for a month. I've seen it before; yes,\r\nseen her shut up in the Vatican, immortal on an old Etruscan vase.\r\nEgypt, Etruria, the Saracen hordes who once overrun all this Southern\r\nItaly, I find, every hour, among live people, some trace of you all; but\r\nof the old Roman, nothing!'\r\n\r\n'You find the old Roman cropping out in these church processions,\r\nfestivals, shrines, and superstitions, don't you?' asked Caper.\r\n\r\n'No! something of those who made the seal, nothing of the impression on\r\nthe wax remains for me. Before Rome was, the great East was, and shall\r\nbe. The Germans are right to call the East the Morning-Land; thence came\r\nlight.... The longer you live along the wave-washed shore of the\r\nMediterranean, the more you will see what a deep hold the East once had\r\non the people of the coast. The Romans, after all, were only opulent\r\ntradesmen, who could buy luxuries without having the education to\r\nappreciate them. So utterly did they ignore the Etruscans, who made them\r\nwhat they were, that you seek in vain to find in Roman history any thing\r\nbut the barest outline of the origin of a people so graceful and\r\nrefined that the Roman citizen was a boot-black in comparison to one of\r\nthem. The Saracens flashed light and life, in later days, once more into\r\nthe Roman leaven. What a dirty, filthy page the whole Gothic middle-age\r\nis at best! It lies like a huge body struck with apoplexy, and only\r\nrestored to its sensual life by the sharp lancet, bringing blood, of\r\nthese same infidels, these stinging Saracens. Go into the mountains back\r\nof us, hunt up the costumes that still remain, and see where they all\r\ncome from--the East. Look at the crescent earrings and graceful twisted\r\ngold-work, from--the East. All the commonest household ware, the\r\nagricultural implements, the manner of cooking their food, and all that\r\nis picturesque in life and religion--all from the East.'\r\n\r\n'Strikes me,' quoth Caper, 'that this question of food touches my\r\nweakest point; therefore, let us go and dine, and continue the lecture\r\nat a more un-hungry period. But where is Bagswell?'\r\n\r\n'He is seeking adventures, of course.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yes, I sec him down there among the billy-goats; let's go and pick\r\nhim up, and then for mine host of the Green Bough.'\r\n\r\nHaving found Bagswell, our trio at once marched to the Green Bough,\r\nwhich they saw was filled to overflowing with country-people, eating and\r\ndrinking, sitting on rough benches, and stowing away food and wine as if\r\nin expectation of being very soon shipwrecked on a desert island, where\r\nthere would be nothing but hard-shell clams and lemons to eat. The\r\nlandlord at once took the trio up-stairs, where, at a large table, were\r\nhalf-a-dozen of his friends, all of the cleanly order of country-people,\r\nstout, and having a well-to-do look that deprecated any thing like\r\nfamine. A young lady of twenty and two hundred, as Caper summed up her\r\nage and weight, was evidently the cynosure of all eyes; two other\r\ngood-natured women, of a few more years and a very little less weight,\r\nand three men, made up the table. Any amount of compliments, as usual,\r\npassed between the first six and the last three comers, prefacing every\r\nthing with desires that they would act without ceremony; but Caper and\r\nRoejean were on a high horse, and they fairly pumped the spring of\r\nItalian compliments so dry, that Bagswell could only make a squeaking\r\nnoise when he tried the handle. This verbifuge of our three artists put\r\ntheir host into an ecstasy of delight, and he circulated all round,\r\nrubbing his hands and telling his six friends that his three friends\r\nwere _milordi_, in very audible whispers, _milordi_ of the most genial,\r\ncourtly, polite, complimentary, cosmopolitan, and exquisite description.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, down sat our trio, and for the sake of future ages which\r\nwill live on steam-bread, electrical beef, and magnetic fish, let us\r\ngive them the bill of fare set before them:\r\n\r\nALL THE WINE THEY COULD DRINK.\r\n\r\nMaccaroni (_fettucia_) a la Milanese--dish two feet in diameter, one\r\nfoot and a half high.\r\n\r\nMutton-chops, with tomato-sauce, (_pomo d'oro._)\r\n\r\nStewed celery, with Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\nStewed chickens.\r\n\r\nMutton-chops, bird-fashion, (_Uccélli di Castrato._ They are made of\r\npieces of mutton rolled into a shape like a bird, and cooked, several at\r\na time, on a wooden spit. They are the _kibaubs_ of the East.)\r\n\r\nBaked pie of cocks' combs and giblets.\r\n\r\nRoasted pig, a twelve-pounder.\r\n\r\nRoast squashes, stuffed with minced veal.\r\n\r\nApples, oranges, figs, and _finocchio_.\r\n\r\n_Crostata di visciola_, or wild-cherry pie, served on an iron plate the\r\nsize of a Roman warrior's shield; the dish evidently having been one\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nMORE WINE!\r\n\r\nThe stout young lady rejoicing in the name of Angelucia, or large angel,\r\nwas fascinated by Roejean's conversational powers and Caper's\r\nattentions; the rest of the company, perfectly at ease on finding out\r\nthat the _milordi_ were not French--Roejean turning American to better\r\nplease them--and that they were moreover full of fun, talked and laughed\r\nas if they were brother Italians. A jollier dinner Caper acknowledged he\r\nhad never known. One of the Italians was farmer-general for one of the\r\nRoman princes; he was a man of broad views, and having traveled to Paris\r\nand London, came home with ultra-liberal sentiments, and to Bagswell's\r\nastonishment, spoke his mind so clearly on the Roman rulers, that our\r\nEnglishman's eyes were slightly opened at the by no means complimentary\r\nexpressions used toward the wire-workers of the Papal government. One\r\nItaly, and Rome its capital, was the only platform our princely farmer\r\nwould take, and he was willing to stake his fortune, a cool one hundred\r\nthousand scudi, on regenerated Italy.\r\n\r\nConversation then fell on the fair; and one of the Italians told several\r\nstories which were broad enough to have shoved the generality of English\r\nand American ladies out of the window of the room. But Angelucia and the\r\ntwo wives of the stout gentlemen never winked; they had probably been to\r\nconfession that morning, had cleared out their old sins, and were now\r\nready to take in a new cargo. In a little while Roejean sent the waiter\r\nout to a café, and he soon returned with coffee for the party, upon\r\nwhich Caper, who had the day before bought some Havana cigars of the man\r\nin the Twelve Apostles, in the piazza Dódici Apostoli, where there is a\r\ngovernment cigar-store for the sale of them, passed them around, and\r\nthey were thoroughly appreciated by the diners. The farmer-general gave\r\nour three artists a hearty invitation to visit him, promising them all\r\nthe horses they could ride, all the wine they could drink, and all the\r\nmaccaroni they could eat. The last clause was inserted for Roejean's\r\nbenefit, who had played a noble game with the grand dish they had had\r\nfor dinner, and at which Angelucia had made great fun, assuring Roejean\r\nhe was Italian to the heart, _e piu basso_.\r\n\r\nThen came good-by, and our artists were off--slowly, meditatively, and\r\nextremely happy, but, so far, quite steady. They walked to the\r\ncastellated monastery of San Basilio, where in the chapel of Saint Nilus\r\nthey saw the celebrated frescoes of Domenichino, and gazed at them\r\ntranquilly and not quite so appreciatingly as they would have done\r\nbefore dinner. Then they came out from the gloom and the air heavy with\r\nincense of the chapel to the bright light and lively scenes of the fair,\r\nwith renewed pleasure. They noticed that every one wore in the hat or in\r\nthe lappel of the coat, if men--in their hair or in their bosom, if\r\nwomen, artificial roses; and presently coming to a stand where such\r\nflowers were for sale, our trio bought half-a-dozen each, and then\r\nturned to where the crowd was thickest and the noise greatest. Three or\r\nfour donkeys loaded with tin-ware were standing near the crowd, when one\r\nof them, ambitious of distinction, began clambering over the tops of the\r\nothers in an insane attempt to get at some greens, temptingly displayed\r\nbefore him. Rattle, bang! right and left went the tins, and in rushed\r\nmen and women with cudgels; but donkey was not to be stopped, and for\r\nfour or five minutes the whole fair seemed gathered around the scene,\r\ncheering and laughing, with a spirit that set Caper wild with\r\nexcitement, and induced him to work his way through the crowd and\r\npresent one old woman who had finally conquered the donkey, with two\r\nlarge roses, an action which was enthusiastically applauded by the\r\nentire assembly.\r\n\r\n'Bravo! bravo! well done, O Englishman!' went up the shout.\r\n\r\nA little farther on they came to a large traveling van, one end of which\r\nwas arranged as a platform in the open air. Here a female dentist, in a\r\nsea-green dress, with her sleeves rolled up and a gold bracelet on her\r\nright arm, held in both hands a tooth-extractor, bound round with a\r\nwhite handkerchief--to keep her steady, as Caper explained, while she\r\npulled a tooth from the head of a young man who was down in front of\r\nher on his knees. Her assistant, a good-looking young man, in very white\r\nteeth and livery, sold some patent toothache drops: _Solo cinque\r\nbaiocchi il fiasco, S'gnore_.\r\n\r\nCaper having seen the tooth extracted, cried, '_Bravissima!_' as if he\r\nhad been at the opera, and threw some roses at the _prima donna\r\ndentista_, who acknowledged the applause with a bow, and requested the\r\nSignore to step up and let her draw him out. This he declined, pleading\r\nthe fact that he had sound teeth. The _dentista_ congratulated him, in\r\nspite of his teeth.\r\n\r\n'But come!' said Bagswell; 'look at that group of men and women in\r\nAlbano costume; there is a chance to make a deuced good sketch.'\r\n\r\nTwo men and three women were seated in a circle; they were laughing and\r\ntalking, and cutting and eating large slices of raw ham and bread, while\r\nthey passed from one to another a three-gallon keg of wine, and drank\r\nout of the bung. As one of the hearty, laughing, jolly, brown-eyed girls\r\nlifted up the keg, Caper pulled out sketch-book and pencil to catch an\r\noutline sketch--of her head thrown back, her fine full throat and breast\r\nheaving as the red wine ran out of the barrel, and the half-closed,\r\ndreamy eyes, and pleasure in the face as the wine slowly trickled down\r\nher throat. One of the men noted the artist making a _ritratto_, and\r\nlaughing heartily, cried out: 'Oh! but you'll have to pay us well for\r\ntaking our portraits!' And the girl, slowly finishing her long\r\ndraught, looked merrily round, shook her finger at the artist, laughed,\r\nand--the sketch was finished. Then Caper taking Roejean's roses, went\r\nlaughingly up to the girl with brown eyes and fine throat, in Albano\r\ncostume, and begged that she would take the poor flowers, and putting\r\nthem next her heart, keep them where it is forever warm--'as the young\r\nman on your left knows very well!' he concluded. This speech was\r\nreceived amid loud applause and cheers, and thanks for the roses and an\r\ninvitation to take a pull at the barrel. Caper waved them _Adio_, and as\r\nour trio turned Rome-ward from the fair, the last things he saw as he\r\nturned his head to take a farewell look, were the roses that the Italian\r\ngirl had placed next her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOMBOLA.\r\n\r\nThe exceedingly interesting amusement known as the Tombola is nothing\r\nmore than the game of Loto, or _Lótto_, 'Brobdignagified,' and played in\r\nthe open air of the Papal States, in Rome on Sundays, and in the\r\nCampagna on certain saints' days, come they when they may.\r\n\r\nThe English have made holiday from holy day, and call the Lord's day\r\nSunday; while the Italians call Sunday Lord's day, or _Domenica_. Their\r\nway of keeping it holy, however, with tombolas, horse-races, and\r\nfire-works, strikes a heretic, to say the least, oddly.\r\n\r\nThe Roman tombola should be seen in the Piazza Navona democratically; in\r\nthe Villa Borghese, if not aristocratically at least middle\r\nclassically, or bourgeois-istically.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, when the English drown themselves, and the\r\nItalians sit in the sun and smile, our friend Caper, one Sunday morning,\r\nputting his watch and purse where pick-pockets could not reach them,\r\nwalked with two or three friends down to the Piazza Navona, stopping, as\r\nhe went along, at the entrance of a small street leading into it, to\r\npurchase a tombola-ticket. The ticket-seller, seated behind a small\r\ntable, a blank-book, and piles of blank tickets, charged eleven\r\n_baiocchi_ (cents) for a ticket, including one _baioccho_ for\r\nregistering it. We give below a copy of Caper's ticket:\r\n\r\n     No. 17 D'ORDINE, LETTERA C.\r\n\r\n     CARTELLA DA RITENERSI DAL GIUOCATORE.\r\n\r\n     8      12      32      87      60\r\n    20       4      76      30      11\r\n    45       3      90      55      63\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numbers on this ticket the registrar filled up, after which it was\r\nhis duty to copy them in his book, and thus verify the ticket should it\r\ndraw a prize.\r\n\r\nThe total amount to be played for that day, the tombola being for the\r\nbenefit of the Cholera Orphans, was one thousand scudi, and was divided\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Terno,.................... $50\r\n    Quaterno,................. 100\r\n    Cinquina,................. 200\r\n    Tombola,.................. 650\r\n                            -------\r\n                             $1000\r\n\r\nHow many tickets were issued, Caper was never able to find out; but he\r\nwas told that for a one thousand dollar tombola the number was limited\r\nto ninety thousand.\r\n\r\nThe tickets, as will be seen above, are divided into three lines, with\r\nfive divisions in each line, and you can fill up the fifteen divisions\r\nwith any numbers running from one to ninety, that you may see fit.\r\nNinety tickets, with numbers from one to ninety, are put in a revolving\r\nglass barrel, and after being well shaken up, some one draws out one\r\nnumber at random, (the slips of paper being rolled up in such manner\r\nthat the numbers on them can not be seen.) It is passed to the judges,\r\nand is then read aloud, and exposed to view, in conspicuous figures, on\r\na stand or stands; and so on until the tombola is won or the numbers all\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nWhoever has three consecutive figures on a line, beginning from left\r\nhand to right, wins the _Terno_; if four consecutive figures, the\r\n_Quaterno_; if five figures, or a full line, the _Cinquina_; and whoever\r\nhas all fifteen figures, wins the Tombola. It often happens that several\r\npersons win the _Terno_, etc., at the same time, in which case the\r\namount of the _Terno_, etc., is equally divided among them. These public\r\ntombolas are like too many thimble-rig tables, ostensibly started for\r\ncharitable objects, and it is popularly whispered that the Roman\r\nnobility and heads of the Church purchase vast numbers of these tickets,\r\nand never fill them up; but then again, they are not large enough for\r\nshaving, and are too small for curl-papers; besides, six hundred and\r\nfifty _scudi_! Whew!\r\n\r\nThe Piazza Navona, bearing on its face, on week-days, the most terrible\r\neruptions of piles of old iron, rags, paintings, books, boots,\r\nvegetables, crockery, jackdaws, contadini, and occasional dead cats,\r\nwore on the Sunday of the tombola--it was Advent Sunday--a clean,\r\nbright, and even joyful look. From many windows hung gay cloths and\r\nbanners; the three fountains were making Roman pearls and diamonds of\r\nthe first water; the entire length (seven hundred and fifty feet) and\r\nbreadth of the square was filled with the Roman people; three bands of\r\nmilitary music played uncensurable airs, since the public censor\r\npermitted them; and several companies of soldiers, with loaded guns,\r\nstood all ready to slaughter the _plebe_. It was a sublime spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut the curtain rose; that is to say, the tombola commenced. At a raised\r\nplatform, a small boy, dressed in black, popularly supposed to be a\r\ncholera orphan, rolled back his shirt-cuffs--he had a shirt--plunged his\r\nhand into the glass barrel, and produced a slip of paper; an assistant\r\ncarried it to the judges--one resembled Mr. Pecksniff--and then the\r\ncrier announced the number, and, presto! on a large blackboard the\r\nnumber appeared, so that every one could see it.\r\n\r\nCaper found the number on his ticket, and was marking it off, when a\r\ncountryman at his side asked him if he would see if the number was on\r\nhis ticket, as he could not read figures. Caper accordingly looked it\r\nover, and finding that it was there, marked it off for him.\r\n\r\n'_Padrone mio_, thank you,' said the man, evidently determined, since he\r\nhad found out a scholar, to keep close by him.\r\n\r\n'Seventeen!' called out the tombola-crier.\r\n\r\n'C----o!' said the contadino, with joy in his face; 'seventeen is always\r\nmy lucky number. My wife was seventeen years old when I married her. My\r\ndonkey was killed by the railroad cars the other day, and he gave just\r\nseventeen groans before he died. I shall have luck to-day.'\r\n\r\nWe refrain from writing the exclamation the contadino prefaced his\r\nremarks with, for fear the reader might have a good Italian\r\ndictionary--an article, by the way, the writer has never yet seen.\r\nSuffice it to say, that the exclamations made use of by the Romans, men\r\nand women, not only of the lower but even the middling class, are of a\r\nnature exceedingly natural, and plainly point to Bacchic and Phallic\r\nsources. The _bestémmia_ of the Romans is viler than the blasphemy of\r\nEnglish or Americans.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the countryman had a seventeen on his ticket, and Caper\r\nmarked it off, at the same time asking him how much he would take for\r\nhis pantaloons. These pantaloons were made of a goat's skin; the long\r\nwhite wool, inches in length, left on and hanging down below the knees\r\nof the man, gave him a Pan-like look, and with the word tombola,\r\nsuggested the lines of that good old song--save the maledictory part of\r\nit:\r\n\r\n  'Tombolin had no breeches to wear,\r\n  So he bought him a goat's skin, to make him a pair.'\r\n\r\nThese breeches were not for sale; they were evidently the joy and the\r\npride of the countryman, who had no heart for trade, having by this time\r\ntwo numbers in one line marked off, only wanting an adjoining one to win\r\nthe _terno_.\r\n\r\n'If you were to win the _terno_, what would you do with it?' Caper asked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'_Accidente!_ I'd buy a barrel of wine, and a hog, and a--'\r\n\r\n'Thirty-two!' shouted the crier.\r\n\r\n'It's on your paper,' said Caper to him, marking it off; 'and you've won\r\nthe _terno_!'\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the man gleamed wildly; he crossed himself, grasped the\r\npaper, and the next thing Caper saw was the crowd dividing right and\r\nleft, as the excited owner of the goat-skin breeches made his way to the\r\nplatform. When he had climbed up, and stepping forward, stood ready to\r\nreceive the _terno_, the crowd jeered and cheered the _villano_, making\r\nfine fun of his goat-skin, and not a little jealous that a _contadino_\r\nshould take the money out of the city.\r\n\r\n'It's always so,' said a fat man next to Caper, 'these _villani_ take\r\nthe bread out of our mouths; but _ecco_! there is another one who has\r\nthe _terno_; blessed be the Madonna, there is a third! Oh! _diavolo_,\r\nthe _villano_ will only have one third of the _terno_; and may he die of\r\napoplexy!'\r\n\r\nA vender of refreshments passing along, the fat man stopped him, and\r\npurchased a _baioccho's_ worth of--what?\r\n\r\nPumpkin-seeds! These are extensively eaten in Rome, as well as the seeds\r\nof pine-cones, acorns, and round yellow chick-peas; these supply the\r\nplace occupied by ground-nuts in our more favored land.\r\n\r\nThere is this excitement about the tombolas in the Piazza Navona, that\r\noccasionally a panic seizes the crowd, and in the rush of people to\r\nescape from the square, some have their pockets picked, and some are\r\ntrampled down, never to rise again. Fortunately for Caper, no stampede\r\ntook place on Advent Sunday, so that he lived to attend another grand\r\ntombola in the Villa Borghese.\r\n\r\nThis was held in the spring-time, and the promise of the ascension of a\r\nballoon added to the attractions of the lottery. To enter the Villa, you\r\nhad to purchase a tombola-ticket, whereas, in the Piazza Navona, this\r\nwas unnecessary. At one end of the amphitheatre of the villa, under the\r\nshade of the ilex-trees, a platform was erected, where the numbers were\r\ncalled out and the awards given.\r\n\r\nCaper, Roejean, and another French artist, not of the French Academy,\r\nnamed Achille Légume, assisted at this entertainment. Légume was a very\r\npleasant companion, lively, good-natured, with a decided penchant for\r\nthe pretty side of humanity, and continually haunted with the idea that\r\na princess was to carry him off from his mistress in spectacles, Madame\r\nArt, and convey him to the land of Cocaigne, where they never make, only\r\nbuy, paintings--of which articles, in parenthesis, Monsieur Achille had\r\na number for sale.\r\n\r\n'Roejean,' said Légume, 'do you notice that distinguished lady on the\r\nplatform; isn't she the Princess Faniente? She certainly looked at _me_\r\nvery peculiarly a few minutes since.'\r\n\r\n'It is the Princess,' answered Roejean, 'and I also noticed, a few\r\nminutes since, when I was on the other side of the circus, that she\r\nlooked at ME with an air.'\r\n\r\n'Don't quarrel,' spoke Caper,'she probably regards you both equally, for\r\n--she squints.'\r\n\r\nThis answer capsized Achille, who having a small red rose-bud in his\r\nbutton-hole, hoped that at a distance he might pass for a chevalier of\r\nthe Legion of Honor, and had conquered something, say something noble.\r\n\r\nA wandering cigar-seller, with _zigarri scelti_, next demanded their\r\nattention, and Roejean commenced an inspection of the selected cigars,\r\nwhich are made by government, and sold at the fixed price of one and a\r\nhalf _baiocchi_ each; even at this low price, the stock of the\r\ntobacco-factory paid thirteen per cent under Antonelli's direction.\r\n\r\n'Antonelli makes a pretty fair cigar,' said, 'but I wish he would wrap\r\nthe ends a little tighter. I'm sorry to hear he is going out of the\r\nbusiness.'\r\n\r\n'Why, he would stay in,' answered Caper, 'but what with baking all the\r\nbread for Rome, and attending to all the fire-wood sold, and trying to\r\nmake Ostia a seaport, and having to fight Monsieur About, and looking\r\nafter his lotteries and big pawnbroker's shop, and balancing himself on\r\nthe end of a very sharp French bayonet, his time is so occupied, he can\r\nnot roll these cigars so well as they ought to be rolled.... But they\r\nhave called out number forty-nine; you've got it, Légume, I remember you\r\nwrote it down. Yes, there it is.'\r\n\r\n'Forty-nine!'\r\n\r\n'I wonder they dare call out '49 in this villa; or have the people\r\nforgotten the revolution already, forgotten that this spot was made\r\nready for a battleground for liberty. The public censor knows his\r\nbusiness; give the Romans bread, and the circus or tombola, they will be\r\ncontent--forever?'\r\n\r\n'_Au diable_ with politics,' interrupted Achille; 'what a very pretty\r\ngirl that is alongside you, Caper. Look at her; how nicely that costume\r\nfits her, the red boddice especially. Where, except in Italy, do you\r\never see such fine black eyes, and such a splendid head of coal-black\r\nhair? This way of having Italian nurses dressed in the Albano costume is\r\nvery fine. That little boy with her is English, certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Och! master Jamey, come in out of that grane grass; d'yiz want ter\r\ndirty the clane pinafore I've put on yiz this blissed afthernoon?' spoke\r\nthe nurse.\r\n\r\n'In the name of all that's awful, what kind of Italian is she speaking?'\r\nasked Légume of Caper.\r\n\r\n'Irish-English,' he answered; 'she is not the first woman out of Old\r\nIreland masquerading as an Albanian nurse. She probably belongs to some\r\nEnglish family who have pretensions.'\r\n\r\n'Ah bah!' said Légume, 'it's monstrous, perfectly atrocious, ugh! Let us\r\nmake a little tour of a walk. The tombola is finished. An Irish dressed\r\nup as an Italian--execrable!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EN AVANT!_\r\n\r\n  O GOD! let us not live these days in vain,\r\n    This variegated life of doubt and hope;\r\n  And though, as day leads night, so joy leads pain,\r\n    Let it be symbol of a broader scope.\r\n\r\n  God! make us serve the monitor within;\r\n    Cast off the trammels that bow manhood down,\r\n  Of form or custom, appetite or sin,\r\n    The care for folly's smile or envy's frown.\r\n\r\n  Oh! that true nobleness that rises up,\r\n    And teaches man his kindredship to Thee;\r\n  Which wakes the slaveling from the poison cup\r\n    Of passion, bidding him be grandly free:\r\n\r\n  May it be ours, in these the evil days,\r\n    That fall upon our nation like a pall;\r\n  May we have power each one himself to raise,\r\n    And place God's signet on the brow of all!\r\n\r\n  Not race nor color is the badge of slaves;\r\n    'Tis manhood, after all, that makes men free;\r\n  Weakness is slavery; 'tis but mind that saves\r\n    God's glorious image as he willed it be.\r\n\r\n  Out of the shadows thick, will coming day\r\n    Send Peace and Plenty smiling o'er our land;\r\n  And the events that fill us with dismay,\r\n    Are but the implements in God's right hand.\r\n\r\n  Where patriot blood is poured as cheap as rain,\r\n    A newer freedom, phoenix-like, will spring;\r\n  Our Father never asks for us in vain:\r\n    From noble seed comes noble harvesting.\r\n\r\n  Then let, to-day, true nobleness be ours;\r\n    That we be worthy of the day of bliss,\r\n  When truth's, and love's, and freedom's allied powers\r\n    Shall bind all nations with fraternal kiss.\r\n\r\n  Would we might see, as did the saint of old,\r\n    The heavens opening, and the starry throng\r\n  Listening to have our tale of peace be told,\r\n    That they may hymn man's resurrection song!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DESPERATION AND COLONIZATION._\r\n\r\nAs the war rolls on, and as the prospects of Federal victory increase,\r\nthe greater becomes the anxiety to know what must be done to secure our\r\nconquests. How shall we reestablish the Union in its early strength? How\r\nshall we definitely crush the possibility of renewed rebellion? The\r\ntremendous taxation which hangs over us gives fearful meaning to these\r\nquestions. And they must be answered promptly and practically.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of Southern independence was from the first a foregone\r\nconclusion to all who impartially studied the geography of this country\r\nand the social progress of its inhabitants. The West, with its growing\r\nmillions vigorously working out the problem of free labor, and of\r\nRepublicanism, will _inevitably_ control the Mississippi river and\r\nmaster the destinies of all soil above the so-called isothermal line,\r\nand probably of much below it. The cotton States, making comparatively\r\nalmost no increase in population, receiving no foreign immigration, and\r\ndesiring none, have precipitated, by war, their destined inferiority to\r\nthe North. It has been from the beginning, only a question of time, when\r\nthey should become the weaker, and goaded by this consciousness, they\r\nhave set their all upon a throw, by appeal to wager of battle, and are\r\nlosing. It is not a question of abolitionism, for it would have been\r\nbrought on without abolition. It is not a question of Southern wrongs,\r\nfor the South never had a _right_ disturbed; and in addition to\r\ncontrolling our Government for years, and directly injuring our\r\nmanufactures, it long swallowed a disproportionably great share of\r\ngovernment appointments, offices, and emoluments. It is simply the last\r\nillustration in history of a smaller and rebellious portion of a\r\ncommunity forced by the onward march of civilization into subordination\r\nto the greater. The men of the South were first to preach Manifest\r\nDestiny and the subjugation of Cuba and Mexico--forgetting that as\r\nregarded civilization, they themselves, on an average, only filled an\r\nintermediate station between the Spanish Creole and the truly _white_\r\nman of the North. Before manifest destiny can overtake the Mexican, it\r\nmust first overtake the Southerner.\r\n\r\nDespite all its external show of elan, courtesy, and chivalry, 'the\r\nSouth,' as it exists, is and ever must be, in the very great aggregate,\r\ninferior to the North in the elements of progress, and in nearly all\r\nthat constitutes true superiority. They boast incessantly of their\r\nsuperior education and culture; but what literature or art has this\r\neducation produced amid their thousands of ladies and gentlemen of taste\r\nand of leisure? The Northern editor of any literary magazine who has had\r\nany experience in by-gone days with the manuscripts of the chivalry,\r\nwill shrug his shoulders with a smile as he recalls the reams of\r\nreechoes of Northern writers, and not unfrequently of mere 'sensation'\r\nthird-rate writers at that, which he was wont to receive from Dixie. And\r\namid all his vaunts and taunts, the consciousness of this intellectual\r\ninferiority never left the Southerner. It stimulated his hatred--it\r\nrankled in his heart. He might boast or lie--and his chief statistician,\r\nDe Bow, was so notoriously convicted of falsifying facts and figures\r\nthat the assertion, as applied to him, is merely historical--but it was\r\nof no avail. The Northern school and the Northern college continued to\r\nbe the great fountain of North-American intellect, and the Southerner\r\nfound himself year by year falling behind-hand intellectually and\r\nsocially as well as numerically. As a last resort, despairing of victory\r\nin the _real_, he plunged after the wild chivalric dream of\r\nindependence; of Mexican and Cuban conquest; of an endless realm and a\r\nreopened slave-trade--or at least of holding the cotton mart of the\r\nworld. It is all in vain. We of the same continent recognize no right in\r\na very few millions to seize on the land which belongs as much to our\r\ndescendants and to the labor of all Europe and of the world as it does\r\nto them. They have _no right_ to exclude white labor by slaves. A\r\nDoughface press may cry, Compromise; and try to restore the _status quo\r\nante bellum_, but all in vain. The best that can be hoped for, is some\r\ningenious temporary arrangement to break the fall of their old\r\nslaveholding friends. It is not as _we_ will, or as _we_ or _you_ would\r\n_like_, that what the Southerners themselves term a conflict of races,\r\ncan be settled. People who burn their own cities and fire their own\r\ncrops are going to the dire and bitter end; and the Might which under\r\nGod's providence is generally found in the long run of history to be the\r\nRight--will triumph at last.\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated in the foregoing passages, the antipathy of the\r\nSouth to the North is deeply seated, springing from such rancor as can\r\nonly be bred between a claim to social superiority mingled with a bitter\r\nconsciousness of inferiority in nearly all which the spirit of the age\r\ndeclares constitutes true greatness. It is almost needless to say, that\r\nwith such motives goading them on, with an ignorant, unthinking mass for\r\nsoldiers, and with unprincipled politicians who have to a want of\r\nprinciple added the newly acquired lust for blood, any prospect of\r\nconciliation becomes extremely remote. We may hope for it--we may and\r\nshould proceed cautiously, so that no possible opportunity of restoring\r\npeace may be lost; but it is of the utmost importance that we be blind\r\nto no facts; and every fact developed as the war advances seems to\r\nindicate that we have to deal with a most intractable, crafty, and\r\nferocious enemy, whom to trust is to be deceived.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the ultimatum of the South is secession or\r\ndeath. We of the North can not contemplate such a picture with calmness,\r\nand therefore evade it as amiably as we can. We say, it stands to reason\r\nthat very few men will burn their own homes and crops, yet every mail\r\ntells us of tremendous suicidal sacrifices of this description. The ruin\r\nand misery which the South is preparing for itself in every way is\r\nincalculable and incredible, and yet there is no diminution of\r\ndesperation. The prosperity which made a mock of honest poverty is now,\r\nas by the retributive judgment of God, sinking itself into penury, and\r\nthe planter who spoke of the Northern serf as a creature just one remove\r\nabove the brute, is himself learning by bitter experience to be a\r\nmud-sill. Verily the cause of the poor and lowly is being avenged. Yet\r\nwith all this there is no hint or hope of compromise; repeated defeats\r\nare, so far, of little avail. The Northern Doughfaces tell us over and\r\nover again, that if we will 'only leave the slave question untouched,'\r\nall will yet be right. 'Only spare them the negro, and they, seeing that\r\nwe do not intend to interfere with their rights, will eventually settle\r\ndown into the Union.' But what is there to guarantee this assertion?\r\nWhat _proof_ have we that the South can be in this manner conciliated?\r\nNone--positively none.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which the Southern press, and, so far as we can learn,\r\nthe Southern people, have so consistently and thoroughly disavowed since\r\nthe war began, as the assertion that a restoration of the Union may be\r\neffected on the basis of undisturbed slavery. They have ridiculed the\r\nDemocrats of the North with as great contempt and as bitter sarcasm as\r\nwere ever awarded of old to Abolitionists, for continually urging this\r\nworn-out folly; for now that the mask is finally thrown off, they make\r\nno secret of their scorn for their old tools and dupes. Slavery is no\r\nlonger the primary object; they are quite willing to give up slavery if\r\nthe growing prosperity of the South should require it; their emissaries\r\nabroad in every _salon_ have been vowing that manumission of their\r\nslaves would soon follow recognition; and it was their rage at failure\r\nafter such wretched abasement and unprincipled inconsistency which, very\r\nnaturally, provoked the present ire of the South against England and\r\nFrance. They, the proud, chivalrous Southrons, who had daringly rushed\r\nto battle as slave lords, after eating abundant dirt as prospective\r\nAbolitionists, after promising any thing and every thing for a\r\nrecognition, received the cold shoulder. No wonder that ill-will to\r\nEngland is openly avowed by the Richmond press as one of the reasons for\r\nburning the cotton as the Northern armies advance.\r\n\r\nThe only basis of peace with the North, as the South declares, is\r\nDisunion; and they do most certainly mean it. No giving up the slave\r\nquestion, no enforcing of fugitive slave laws; no, not the hanging of\r\nMessrs. Garrison and Phillips, or any other punishment of all\r\nEmancipationists--as clamored for by thousands of trembling\r\ncowards--would be of any avail. It is disunion or nothing--and disunion\r\nthey can not have. There shall be no disunion, no settlement of any\r\nthing on _any_ basis but the Union. Richmond papers, after the battle of\r\nPittsburgh Landing, proposed peace and separation. They do not know us.\r\nThe North was never so determined to push on as now; never so eager for\r\nbattle or for sacrifices. If the South is in earnest, so are we; if they\r\nhave deaths to avenge, so have we; if they cry for war to the knife, so\r\nsurely as God lives they can have it in full measure. For thirty years\r\nthe blazing straw of Southern insult has been heaped on the Northern\r\nsteel; and now that the latter is red-hot, it shall scorch and sear ere\r\nit cools, and they who heated it shall feel it.\r\n\r\nWe may as well make up our minds to it first as last, that we must at\r\nevery effort and at _any_ cost, conquer this rebellion. There is no\r\nalternative. This done, the great question which remains to settle, is,\r\nhow shall we manage the conquered provinces? There are fearful obstacles\r\nin the way; great difficulties, such as no one has as yet calmly\r\nrealized; difficulties at home and abroad. We have a fierce and\r\ndiscontented population to keep under; increased expenses in every\r\ndepartment of government; but it is needless to sum them up. The first\r\nand most apparent difficulty is that involved in the form of government\r\nto be adopted. As the rebellious States have, by the mere act of\r\nsecession, forfeited all State rights, and thereby reduced themselves to\r\nterritories, this question would seem to settle itself without\r\ndifficulty, were it not that a vast body of the ever-mischief-making,\r\never-meddling, and never-contented politicians (who continue to believe\r\nthat the millennium would at once arrive were Emancipation only\r\nextinguished) cry out against this measure as an infringement of those\r\nSouthern rights which are so dear to them. They argue and hope in vain.\r\nNever more will the South come back to be served and toadied to by them\r\nas of old; never more will they receive contemptuous patronage and\r\ndishonorable honors. It is all passed. Those who look deepest into this\r\nbattle, and into the future, see a resistance, grim and terrible, to the\r\ndeath; and one which will call for the strictest and sternest watch and\r\nward. It will only be by putting fresh life and fresh blood into\r\nSecessia, that union can be practically realized. Out of the old\r\nSouthern stock but little can be made. A great portion must be kept\r\nunder by the strong hand; a part may be induced to consult its own\r\ninterests, and reform. But the great future of the South, and the great\r\nhope of a revived and improved Union will be found in colonizing certain\r\nportions of the conquered territory with free white labor.\r\n\r\nA more important topic, and one so deeply concerning the most vital\r\nprosperity of the United States, was never before submitted to the\r\nconsideration of her citizens. If entertained by Government and the\r\npeople on a great, enterprising, and vigorous scale, as such schemes\r\nwere planned and executed by the giant minds of antiquity, it may be\r\nmade productive of such vast benefits, that in a few years at most, the\r\nmillions of Americans may look back to this war as one of the greatest\r\nblessings that ever befell humanity, and Jefferson Davis and his\r\ncoadjutors be regarded as the blind implements by which God advanced\r\nhuman progress, as it had never before advanced at one stride. But to\r\neffect this, it should be planned and executed as a great, harmonious,\r\nand centrally powerful scheme, not be tinkered over and frittered away\r\nby all the petty doughfaces in every village. In great emergencies,\r\ngreat acts are required.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the only certain road to Union-izing the South is, to\r\nplant in it colonies of Northern men. Thousands, hundreds of thousands\r\nnow in the army, would gladly remain in the land of tobacco or of\r\ncotton, if Government would only provide them with the land whereon to\r\nlive. Were they thus settled, and were every slave in the South\r\nemancipated by the chances of war, there would be no danger to apprehend\r\nas to the future of the latter. Give a Yankee a fat farm in Dixie, and\r\nwe may rely upon it that although a Southern nabob may not know how to\r\nget work out of a 'free nigger', the Northerner will contrive to\r\npersuade Cuffy to become industrious. We have somewhere heard of a\r\nVermonter, who taught ground-hogs or 'wood-chucks' to plant corn for\r\nhim; the story has its application. Were Cuffy ten times as lazy as he\r\nis, the free farmer would contrive to get him to work. And in view of\r\nthis, I am not sorry that the Legislatures of the border wheat States\r\nare passing laws to prevent slaves from entering their territories. The\r\nmission of the black is to labor as a free man in the South, under the\r\nfarmer, until capable of being a farmer on his own account.\r\n\r\nThe manner and method of colonizing free labor in the South deserves\r\nvery serious consideration, and is, it may be presumed, receiving it at\r\nthe hands of Government, in anticipation of further developments in this\r\ndirection. We trust, however, that the Administration will _lead_, as\r\nrapidly as possible, in this matter, and that the President will soon\r\nmake it the subject of a Message as significant and as noble as that\r\nwherein this country first stood committed by its chief officer to\r\nEmancipation, the noblest document which ever passed from president or\r\npotentate to the people; a paper which, in the eyes of future ages, will\r\ncast Magna Charta itself into the shade, and rank with the glorious\r\nmanumission of the Emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe primary question would be, whether it were more expedient to scatter\r\nfree labor all over the South, or simply form large colonies at such\r\npoints as might serve to effectually break up and surround the\r\nconfederacy. Without venturing to decide on the final merit of either\r\nplan, we would suggest that the latter would be, for a beginning,\r\nprobably most feasible. Should Virginia, certain points on the Atlantic\r\ncoast, embracing the larger cities and vicinity of forts, and Texas, be\r\nlargely or strongly occupied by free men, we should at once throw a\r\nchain around the vanquished foe, whose links would grow stronger every\r\nyear. With slavery abolished--and it is at present abolishing itself\r\nwith such rapidity that it is almost time lost to discuss the\r\nsubject--immigration from Europe would stream in at an unprecedented\r\nrate, and in a few years, all the old Southern system become entirely a\r\ntradition of the past, like that of the feudal chivalry which the\r\npresent chivalry so fondly ape.\r\n\r\nThe enormous internal resources of Eastern Virginia, her proximity to\r\nfree soil, the arrogance and insubordination of her inhabitants, render\r\nher peculiarly fitted for colonization. Not less attractive is Texas--a\r\nState which, be it remembered, is capable of raising six times as much\r\ncotton as is now raised in the whole South, and which, if only settled\r\nand railroaded-ed, would, in a few years, become the wealthiest\r\nagricultural State in America. But let our army once settle in the\r\nSouth, there will be little danger of its not retaining its possessions.\r\nHe who can win can wear.\r\n\r\nThe country has thus far treated very gingerly the question of\r\nconfiscation, which is, however, destined to thrust itself very\r\nprominently forward among the great issues of the day, and which is\r\nclosely allied to colonization. That the South, after forcing upon us\r\nsuch a war as this, with its enormous losses and expenses, should be\r\nsubjected to no penalty, is preposterous. Confiscation there must\r\nbe--not urged inhumanly on a wholesale scale, but in such a manner as to\r\nproperly punish those who were forward in aiding rebellion. When this\r\nwar broke out, the South was unanimous in crying for plunder, in\r\nspeaking of wasting our commerce and our cities on a grand scale. But it\r\nis needless to point out that punishment of the most guilty alone would\r\nof itself half cover the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that already, since the decree of emancipation in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, a fresh spirit of enterprise has manifested itself\r\nthere. Within a few days after the signature of the President to that\r\nact, Northern men began to prepare for renewed industry and action in\r\nthe old slave field. The tide of free labor which will rush into\r\nVirginia, after the chances of war or other action shall have\r\nemancipated that State, will be incalculable. Its worn-out plantations\r\nwill become thriving farms, its mines and inexhaustible water-powers\r\nwill call into play the incessant demand and supply of vigorous industry\r\nand active capital. We may hasten the movement or we may not, by direct\r\nlegislation. For the present, it seems advisable to await the rapidly\r\ndeveloping chances of war and their results; but the great rush of free\r\nlabor will come, and that rapidly, and Virginia, disenthralled, become,\r\nin all probability, once more the first among the States.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the desperation of the rebels, and of the idleness of\r\nexpecting from them any peaceable compromise. Those who, in the South,\r\nwill take the oath of allegiance, and who have probably acted only under\r\ncompulsion, should be spared. But there is a vast number who are as yet\r\nunder the dominion of a madness, for which nothing but the most vigorous\r\nmeasures can be of any avail. It is evident that at present, every where\r\nexcept in Halleck's department, government is too indulgent. Traitors\r\nflaunt and boast openly in the border States, and publicly scheme with\r\ntheir doughface allies, to defeat the Union cause in every possible way,\r\ntoo often with signal success. The more mercy they receive, the more\r\ninsolent do they become, and yet every effort has been made, and is\r\nmaking, 'to conciliate.' Let Government be vigorous, and rely only on\r\nits strong hand, so far as the management of avowed traitors is\r\nconcerned; such men hold to no faith, and keep no oaths. With such, a\r\nthreat of confiscation will be found of more avail than all the lenity\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nWe may quote, in this connection, from a letter to the Salem _Register_,\r\nfrom Captain Driver, who hoisted 'Old Glory' at Nashville, when our\r\ntroops took possession of that city. After speaking of the immense\r\namount of property being destroyed through the State, he asks:\r\n\r\n     'Is there one man North, who now expects to make peace, based on\r\n     compromise with such men as lead here? Is there one who expects a\r\n     lasting peace in this land, until the armed heel of freedom's\r\n     soldiers marks every inch of slave soil? If there is, he knows\r\n     little of the South or Southern men and women. One defeat of the\r\n     Federal forces, and madness would be rampant here. In the hour of\r\n     victory, they would destroy every Union family in the South. We\r\n     live on a volcanic mass, which at any moment may upheave and blow\r\n     us to glory without the benefit of the clergy, the most of whom are\r\n     in the army of Dixie.\r\n\r\n     'Our enemy is as bitter as death, as implacable as the savage of\r\n     the forest; he will do any thing to gain his end. Twice has the\r\n     'Black Flag' been flaunted in our faces, and cheered by a portion\r\n     of our citizens. Our women are more bitter than the men, and our\r\n     children are taught to hate the North, in church, in school, and at\r\n     the fireside. Our city still presents a sullen, silent front; it\r\n     will take as long time to root treason out of Nashville us it did\r\n     the household sins of Egypt out of Israel.\r\n\r\n     'Had I my way, I would confiscate the property of all traitors,\r\n     work the slaves three or four years under overseers, on the land of\r\n     their masters, sell the crops thus raised, and pay the war debt;\r\n     this would save the people from taxation. The fifth year's crop\r\n     give to the slaves, and send them to Texas or elsewhere; give them\r\n     a governance, buy up the slaves of the loyal men, and let them be\r\n     sent to their brethren. The land confiscated, I would divide among\r\n     the soldiers of the North and the widows and orphans of those\r\n     deluded poor men of the South who fell victims to false notions of\r\n     'Southern Rights;' compel the Northern man to settle on his grant,\r\n     or to send a settler of true, industrious habits, and give him no\r\n     power to alienate his title for ten or more years. This will insure\r\n     an industrious, worthy, patriotic people for the South. One man\r\n     will make one bale of cotton, others ten; your spindles and looms\r\n     will be kept running by free men, and slavery will cease forever,\r\n     as it should do. Slavery is a curse, a crime, a mildew, and must\r\n     end, or war will blast our fair heritage for all time to come.'\r\n\r\nSuch are the views of one who seems to know what a real\r\nSouthern-sympathizing secessionist is made of. Let it not be forgotten\r\nthat there are thousands of native Tennesseeans, as of other borderers\r\nof intelligence, character, and influence, who have offered to raise\r\nregiments to fight for the Union; and this fact is urged by the\r\ndoughface democrats as a reason for increased leniency to traitors. We\r\nconfess we do not see what connection exists between the two. If these\r\nloyal borderers are sincere in their professions, they have certainly no\r\nsympathy for the wretches around them, who visit with death or pillage\r\nevery friend of the Union. But it is idle to argue with traitors. Either\r\nwe are at war, or we are not; and if the history of the past eighteen\r\nmonths has not taught the country the folly of procrastinating, nothing\r\nwill do it. 'When you feel the knife in your heart, _then_ wish that you\r\nhad fought!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE EDUCATION TO BE._\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA right intellectual education presupposes three essential features: the\r\nselection of the most suitable subjects for study; the proper\r\npresentation of these, in the order of their dependence, and in view of\r\nthe gradual growth of the pupil's powers of comprehension; and, not less\r\nimportant than either of these, the finding out and following of the\r\nbest method and order of presenting the truths belonging to each subject\r\nto be studied. These are the problems with which, as something apart\r\nfrom Metaphysics or Logic, the possible but yet unachieved pedagogical\r\nscience has to deal. To the first of these questions, What shall we\r\nteach? or, as he phrases it, 'What knowledge is of most worth?' Mr.\r\nSpencer (presuming the child already supplied with his bare implements,\r\nreading, spelling, and penmanship) is led, after a long discussion, to\r\nconclude that 'the uniform reply is, Science.' The 'counts' on which he\r\nbases this verdict, are, the purposes of self-preservation; the gaining\r\nof a livelihood; the due discharge of parental functions; qualification\r\nfor political responsibilities; the production and enjoyment of art; and\r\ndiscipline, whether intellectual, moral, or religious. Taken at his own\r\nshowing, Mr. Spencer seems to contemplate, as his model of an educated\r\nman, a prodigiously capable and efficient mute. But can he deny that the\r\nability _to express_ what one may know, and in speech, as well as in\r\nproduction, is at once the final proof, and in a very real sense the\r\nindispensable consummation of such knowing? _Language_ is the\r\ncounterpart and complement of _Science_. The two are but two sides, and\r\neither separately an incomplete one, of one thing; that one thing we may\r\nname _definite and practical knowledge_; and it is the only sort of\r\nknowledge that has real value. Language is yet larger than all the\r\nsciences proper which it embodies, namely, those clustering about\r\nPhilology, Grammar, and Rhetoric. Of these, all deal with words, or\r\nthose larger words--sentences; but under these forms they deal, in\r\nreality, with the objective world as perceived or apprehended by us, and\r\nas named and uttered in accordance with subjective aptitudes and laws.\r\nIn language, then, there stands revealed, in the degree in which we can\r\nascend to it, all that is yet known of the external world, and all that\r\nhas yet evolved itself of the human mind. Can we decry the study of that\r\nwhich, whether as articulate breath, or through a symbolism of visible\r\nforms, mirrors to us at once all of nature and all of humanity? But if\r\nwe yield this claim in behalf of language, noting meanwhile that the\r\nmathematics are already well represented in our courses of instruction,\r\nthen much of Mr. Spencer's eloquent appeal is simply wasted by\r\nmisdirection. All that he had really to claim is, that a\r\ndisproportionate time is now surrendered to the studies of the symbols,\r\nas such, and too often to characteristics of them not yet brought in any\r\nway into scientific coördination, nor of a kind having practical or\r\npeculiarly disciplinary value. If Mr. Spencer had insisted on a more\r\njust division of the school studies between the mathematical, physical,\r\nbiological, and linguistic sciences, he would have struck a chord\r\nyielding no uncertain sound, and one finding response in a multitude of\r\nadvanced and liberal minds. If he had gone yet deeper, and disclosed to\r\nhis readers the fact that the fundamental need is, not that we study\r\nwhat in the more restricted sense is known as _Science_, but that we\r\nbegin to study all proper and profitable subjects, as we now do hardly\r\nany of them, _in the true scientific spirit and method_, he would not\r\nmerely seem to have said, but would have succeeded in saying, something\r\nof the deepest and most pressing import to all educators.\r\n\r\nThe volume of republished papers from Mr. Barnard's able _Journal of\r\nEducation_--the first of a series of five under the general title of\r\n'Papers for the Teacher'--will afford to those desirous of investigating\r\nthe second of the problems above proposed, some useful material and\r\nhints. Especially will this be true, we think, of the first series of\r\narticles, by Mr. William Russell, on the 'Cultivation of the Perceptive,\r\nExpressive, and Reflective Faculties;' and of the second, by Rev. Dr.\r\nHill, now President of Antioch College, upon the 'True Order of\r\nStudies.' In the outset of his first essay, (which appeared in March,\r\n1859,) Dr. Hill takes it '_for granted_ [postulating, we think, a pretty\r\nlarge ground, and one that analysis and proof would better have\r\nbefitted] that there is a rational order of development in the course of\r\nthe sciences, and that it ought to be followed in common education.' The\r\norder he finds is that of five great studies, Mathesis, [mathematics;]\r\nPhysics, or Natural History; History; Psychology; and Theology. 'We also\r\ntake it for granted,' he continues, 'that there is a natural order of\r\ndevelopment in the human powers, and that studies should be so arranged\r\nas to develop the powers in this order.' Here two very difficult\r\nproblems are undertaken--the hierarchy of the sciences, and the analysis\r\nof the intellect--and though we seem to find in the elucidation of the\r\nsubject traces of that 'harmony of results of the two lines of inquiry,'\r\non which the author relies as one source of confirmation of the results\r\nthemselves, yet we can not admit that the solutions given us remove all,\r\nnor even all the main difficulties of the case. While we regard the\r\nmathematics, physics, psychology, and theology as quite well\r\nindividualized and distinct lines of scientific research, we can not\r\nhelp feeling that the day has hardly come for embracing _physiology_\r\nunder either physics or psychology; the forming of the bile and the\r\ngrowing and waste of brain are yet, to our apprehension, too far removed\r\nfrom the gravitation of planets or the oxidation of phosphorus, on the\r\none hand, as they are from the scintillations of wit or the severe march\r\nof reason on the other, for ready affiliation with either. We question\r\ndecidedly whether Theology proper can, at the most, be more than a very\r\nrestricted subject; and quite as decidedly whether the heterogeneous\r\nmatters grouped under History, namely, Agriculture, Trade, Manufactures,\r\nthe Fine Arts, Language, Education, Politics, and Political Economy, are\r\nor can be shown to be linked by any principle of essential unity. Most\r\nof these have their historical side; but their unhistorical and\r\nscientific side most interests the great body of learners. And this\r\nlatter aspect of some of them, Education and Politics especially,\r\nbelongs after, not before Psychology. Then, the great fact of\r\nexpression--Language--has not adequate justice done it by the position\r\nit is here placed in. Want of space is the least among our reasons for\r\nforbearing to attempt here a classification of the sciences--a work\r\nwhich Ramus, D'Alembert, Stewart, Bentham, and Ampère successively\r\nessayed and left unfinished. But the principle that the faculties in\r\ntheir order are called out by the branches named in their order, is\r\nquite given up as the writer proceeds, and distinctly so in his Tabular\r\nView of the studies adapted to successive ages. In actual life, usually\r\nthe first set teaching the infant receives is in language; and even\r\nthough it previously is and should be getting its ideas of forms,\r\ncolors, and other qualities, in the concrete, yet it remains far from\r\ntrue that we should 'pay our earliest attention to the development of\r\nthe child's power to grasp the truths of space and time.' Dr. Hill has,\r\nhowever, taken in these papers a step in a needful direction; and\r\nperhaps the best we could at first expect, are hints and an\r\napproximation toward a much desired result.\r\n\r\nWe may fairly assume that Mr. Willson's answer to the question, What to\r\nteach? is in some good degree embodied in his elaborate series of\r\n'School and Family Readers,' of which the first six of the eight\r\ncontemplated volumes have already appeared. These Readers aim to replace\r\nin a good degree the more purely literary materials of most of their\r\npredecessors, with a somewhat systematic and complete view of the more\r\ngenerally useful branches of human knowledge. They begin, where the\r\nchild is sure to be interested, with studies of animals, illustrated\r\nwith good and often spirited drawings, and proceed through Physiology,\r\nBotany, Architecture, Physical Geography, Chemistry, etc., up at last,\r\nas is promised, to Mental and Moral Philosophy, Natural Theology,\r\nRhetoric, Criticism, Logic, the Fine Arts, including that one of those\r\narts, as we presume we may class it, with which pupils of the rural\r\nschools will have best cause to become acquainted, namely, Gardening!\r\nReaders on this plan have long been known in the schools of Prussia and\r\nHolland, and are even lately well received in England, in the form of\r\nMr. Constable's popular series; though apparently, when finished, the\r\nAmerican series will be more full and complete in topics and treatment\r\nof them than any preceding one. Of course, restricted space, and the\r\nrange of maturity of talents addressed, compel the presentation in\r\nsimplified form of scarcely more than 'a little learning' under the\r\nseveral heads; and the compiler sensibly tells us his aim is not to give\r\na full exposition of any theme, but rather, 'to present a _pleasing\r\nintroduction_ to science.' We may grant, in the outset, that most pupils\r\nwill really comprehend, in and through the reading of it, but a modicum\r\nof all the high and large fields of knowledge here intimated to them;\r\nbut who that can now look on his school-days as in the past, does not\r\nremember how many grandiose sentences he was then called on to utter in\r\ncadence duly swelling or pathetic, but of the meaning of which he had\r\nnot the most distant approach to a true comprehension? It was _ours_\r\nonce to be of a class whose enunciative powers were disciplined by\r\nrepeated goings 'through' of the 'Old English Reader,' and well do we\r\nremember how the accidental omission of the full pause after 'shows' in\r\nthe quotation ending the piece entitled 'Excellency of the Holy\r\nScriptures,' caused a certain teacher to understand(!) and direct us to\r\nread the whole sentence thus: 'Compared, indeed, with this, all other\r\nmoral and theological wisdom\r\n\r\n     'Loses, discountenanced, and like folly shows' BEATTIE.'\r\n\r\nNow, it is true, the whole sentence, in its best state, would have shown\r\nto our green understandings like enough to 'folly,' if we had once made\r\nthe effort to find meaning of any sort in it; nor can it be considered\r\nthe most profitable use of school time, thus to 'like folly show' to\r\nunknit juvenile brains the abstract and high thought of mature and great\r\nminds, who uttered them with no foolishness or frivolity in their\r\nintentions! We see reasons to expect substantial advantages from Mr.\r\nWillson's books; and we believe teachers will appreciate and use them.\r\nWe could wish they had not gone so far to mechanicalize the pupil's\r\nenunciation; by too freely introducing throughout the points of\r\ninflection; but it is safe to predict that most pupils will take up with\r\ninterest the simplified readings in science; that they will comprehend\r\nand remember a useful portion of what they read; that the lessons will\r\nafford both them and the teachers points of suggestion from which the\r\nmind can profitably be led out to other knowledge and its connections;\r\nand that they who go through the series can at least leave school with\r\nsome more distinct ideas as to what the fields of human knowledge are,\r\nand what they embrace, than was ever possible under the _régime_ of\r\nmerely fine writing, of pathetic, poetic, and generally miscellaneous\r\nselections.\r\n\r\nThe educational interest that grew up in our country between the years\r\n1810 and 1828, about the year 1835 gave place to a stagnation that has\r\nmarked nearly the whole of the period intervening between the last-named\r\nand the present date. In the year 1858, the _New-York Teacher_ was made\r\nthe first medium of some thoughts in substance agreeing with those set\r\nforth in the earlier part of this paper, claiming the indispensableness\r\nto true education of a more true and liberal _work_ on the part of the\r\nlearner's intellectual faculties, and of a more true and logical\r\n_consecution_ than has yet been attained, and one corresponding to the\r\nnatural order of the intellectual operations, in the books and lessons\r\nthrough which the usual school studies are to be mastered. 'Make'--said\r\nthe first of the articles setting forth this thought--'the [form of the]\r\nfacts and principles of any branch of study as simple as you choose, and\r\nunless the order of their presentation be natural--be that order, from\r\nobservation to laws and causes, in which the mind naturally moves,\r\nwhenever it moves surely and successfully--the child, except in the rare\r\ncase of prodigies that find a pleasure in unraveling complexity, will\r\nstill turn from the book with loathing. He will do so because he must.\r\nIt is not in his nature to violate his nature for the sake of acquiring\r\nknowledge, however great the incentives or threatenings attending the\r\nprocess.' 'The child's mind ... with reference to all unacquired\r\nknowledge ... stands in precisely the attitude of the experimenters and\r\ndiscoverers of riper years. It is to come to results not only previously\r\nunknown, but not even conceived of. Because their nature and faculties\r\nare identical, the law of their intellectual action must be the same.'\r\n'Study is research.' In subsequent articles, it was claimed that the law\r\nhere indicated is for intellectual education, the one true and\r\ncomprehensive law; and it was expressed more fully in the words: 'All\r\ntrue study is investigation; all true learning is discovery.'\r\n\r\nWe say, now, that when the first of these articles appeared, the leading\r\nthought it contained, namely, that our pupils can and should learn by a\r\nprocess of _re-discovery_, in the subjects they pursue, had not in\r\ndistinct nor in substantial statement in any way appeared in the\r\neducational treatises or journals; and further, that it was not, so far\r\nas their uttered or published expressions show, previously occupying the\r\nattention of teachers or of educational writers, nor was it the subject\r\nor substance of remarks, speeches, or debates, in the meetings of\r\nTeachers' Associations. We say further, and because history and justice\r\nrequire it, that in our country, especially in the educational movements\r\nin the State of New-York, and in the several national associations of\r\neducators, a marked change and revolution in the course of much of the\r\nthought and discussion touching matters of education has, since the year\r\n1858, become apparent, and that to the most casual participant or\r\nobserver, and in the precise direction in which the thought above\r\nreferred to points. The essential issue itself--the practicability and\r\ndesirableness of casting our studies into the form of courses of\r\nre-discovery is somewhat distantly and delicately approached,\r\nincorporated into speeches by an allusion or in the way of _apercû_, or\r\nthrown out as a suggestion of a partial or auxiliary method with the\r\nyounger learners, all which is of a fashion highly patronizing to the\r\nthought, spite of the scruples about confessing who was the suggester of\r\nit. But other questions, which spring up in the train of this, which by\r\nthemselves had received attention long since, but had been mainly\r\ndropped and unheard of among us during the past twenty-five years, have\r\ncome again into full and unconcealed prominence. Such are the questions\r\nabout the natural order of appearance of the faculties in childhood, as\r\nto what are the elementary faculties of the mind, as to the adaptation\r\nof the kinds and order of studies to these, etc. And thus, all at once,\r\nis disclosed that Education itself, which many had thought quite a\r\n'finished' thing, well and happily disposed of, or at least so far\r\nperfected as to leave no work further save upon the veriest outskirts of\r\ndetails, is in truth a giant superstructure with foundations in sand, or\r\nso almost visibly lacking underneath it, that it threatens to fall. For,\r\nin the name of the simplest of all common sense, how are we to educate\r\nto the best, _not yet knowing_--and that is now acknowledged--_what are\r\nthe_ FACULTIES _of the very minds we are dealing with, nor what are the_\r\nPROCESSES _by which those minds begin and keep up their advance in\r\nknowledge?_ So, also, those who in the most charitable mood could see in\r\neducation only something too hum-drum and narrow for their better\r\nfancies, find it now rising and expanding into a new and large field for\r\nintellectual effort, full of interesting problems, and fraught with\r\nrealizations as yet undreamed of.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, that the young mind had always learned what it did\r\nlearn, by discoveries; we answer, our methods and our books have not in\r\nany sufficient degree recognized the fact, provided for it, nor taken\r\nadvantage of it. It may be said, that writers had previously\r\nacknowledged that the mind learns well--some of them even, that it\r\nlearns best--when it discovers: we answer, that nevertheless, no one had\r\nrecorded it as a well-grounded, universal conclusion and positive law,\r\nthat the mind only can learn, in all strictly scientific matters, as it\r\ndiscovers, and that hence, the canons of the method of discovery become\r\nrules for directing, in studies of this character, the education of the\r\nyoung. Aristotle and Bacon have recognized and enforced upon the adult\r\nmind its two master methods of advance by reasoning. But our children\r\nhave their knowing also to attain to, their discoveries to make, their\r\nlogic of proof, on occasions, to employ. Shall we lavish all the\r\ntreasures of method on those who have passed the formative stage of\r\nmind, and acquired the bent of its activities? Rather, we think, the\r\ntrue intellectual method--combining both Baconian _induction_ and\r\nAristotelian _deduction_--yet waits to realize some of the best of the\r\napplication and work for which its joint originators and their\r\nco-workers have been preparing it; and that perhaps one of the highest\r\nconsummations of this one method of thought may yet appear in the\r\ncarrying forward, with more of certainty, pleasure, and success in their\r\nattaining of knowledge, the lisping philosophers of our school-rooms and\r\nour firesides.\r\n\r\nFrom one source, disconnected latterly from those to which I have thus\r\nfar called attention, there has arisen a decidedly progressive movement\r\nin the direction of right teaching, and one that, at least in\r\ngeographical studies, promises soon to result in a consummation of great\r\nimportance. Though Pestalozzianism, as further developed by the Prussian\r\neducators and schools, has never yet realized the completely inductive\r\nand consecutive character here contended for, it has been tending in a\r\ndegree toward such a result; and this is perhaps seen in the most marked\r\nway in the method of teaching geography developed by Humboldt and\r\nRitter, and represented in this country by their distinguished pupil,\r\nProfessor Guyot. This method subordinates political to physical\r\ngeography, proceeding from facts to laws, and by setting out with the\r\ngrand natural features of the globe, leads the learner to comprehend not\r\nonly the existence, boundaries, capitals, and strength of nations, but\r\nthe reasons why these have come to be what they are. As tending in the\r\nsame true direction, we should not fail to mention also the\r\nfaithfully-executed series of raised or embossed maps of the late Mr.\r\nSchroeter, presenting not only the profile but the comparative\r\nelevations of the land-surfaces or continents and islands, and, in\r\ndetail, of the several political divisions of the globe, thus at once\r\nmaking the ocular study of geography _real_, and not as formerly,\r\nleaving the right conception of the land-surfaces to the pupil's unaided\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAmong the decisive and important steps marking the revival of\r\neducational interest among us, is that looking to the introduction into\r\nour primary schools of the simple lessons for what is called the\r\n'education of the senses,' and what is in fact the solicitation of the\r\nperceptive faculties, and the storing of them, with their proper ideas,\r\nthrough the avenues of sense. When employed about observing or finding\r\nand naming the parts or qualities and uses of objects, as _glass,\r\nleather, milk, wood, a tree, the human body_, etc., this sort of\r\nteaching takes the name of 'Object Lessons;' when it rises to\r\nphilosophizing in the more obvious and easy stages about natural\r\nphenomena, as _rain, snow,_ etc., or about parts of the system of\r\nnature, as _oceans, mountains, stars,_ etc., it is sometimes termed\r\n'Lessons in Common Things.' In the year 1860, Mr. E.A. Sheldon, the\r\nenterprising superintendent of the schools of that city, first\r\nintroduced with some degree of completeness and system, this sort of\r\nteaching into the primary schools of Oswego. In March, 1861, under the\r\nleadership also, as we infer, of their superintendent, Mr. William H.\r\nWells, the Educational Board of the city of Chicago adopted a still more\r\nminutely systematized and more extensive course of instruction of this\r\nsort, arranged in ten successive grades, and intended to advance from\r\nthe simple study of objects, forms, colors, etc., gradually to the\r\nprosecution of the regular and higher studies. The greater naturalness,\r\nlife-likeness, and interest of this kind of mental occupation for young\r\nlearners, over the old plan of restricting them mainly to the bare\r\nalphabet, with barren spelling, reading, definitions, and so on, is at\r\nonce obvious in principle and confirmed by the facts; and for the\r\nyounger classes--a stage of the utmost delicacy and importance to the\r\nfuture habits of the learner--the fruits must appear in increased\r\nreadiness of thought and fullness of ideas, and in a preparation for\r\nmore true and enlarged subsequent comprehension of the proper branches\r\nof study; provided, we must add, that these also, when reached, be\r\ntaught by a method best suited to their subject-matter and to the higher\r\nrange of mental activity required to deal with it. Whether, now, the\r\nobject-lesson system and plan is the one competent to carry on the\r\nlearner through those later studies, is another and larger question, and\r\none to which we shall presently recur.\r\n\r\nUnder the recall of the minds of educators among us to fundamental\r\nprinciples of methods and tendencies in teaching, which we have pointed\r\nout, it was but natural to expect attempts to be made toward remedying\r\nthe defects and supplying the needs that could not fail to be detected\r\nin our teaching processes. Naturally, too, such attempts would result in\r\nthe bringing forward, sooner or later, of novelties in the topics and\r\nform of the school-books. What the pen--which, in the outset, proposed\r\nthe necessity of molding the school-work into a course of re-discoveries\r\nof the scientific truths--should reasonably be expected to do toward\r\nsupplying the want it had indicated; or what it may, in the interim,\r\nhave actually accomplished toward furnishing the working implements\r\nrequisite to realizing in practice the possible results foreshadowed by\r\nthe best educational theories, it may be neither in place nor needful\r\nthat we should here intimate. Sometimes, indeed, there is in our social\r\nmovements evidence of a singular sort of intellectual _catalysis;_ and a\r\nmute fact, so it _be_ a fact, and even under enforced continuance of\r\nmuteness, through influence of temporary and extraneous circumstances,\r\nmay yet, like the innocent _platinum_ in a mixture of certain gases, or\r\nthe equally innocent _yeast-plant_ vegetating in the 'lump' of dough,\r\ntake effect in a variety of ways, as if by mere presence.\r\n\r\nWe shall remember how even Virgil had to write:\r\n\r\n     'Hos ego versiculos scripsi: tulit alter honores!'\r\n\r\nAnd the veriest bumpkin knows the force of the adage about one's shaking\r\nthe tree, for another to gather up the fruit. But Virgil was patient,\r\nand did well at the last; though the chronicles do not tell us how many\r\npears ever came to the teeth of him that did the tree-shaking. At all\r\nevents, it is satisfying to know that time spins a long yarn, and comes\r\nto the end of it leisurely and at his own wise motion!\r\n\r\nThe English object-lesson system being now fairly and successfully\r\ndomesticated among us, and to such an extent as to call for the\r\ninvitation and temporary residence among us, in the city of Oswego, of a\r\ndistinguished lady-teacher from the English Training Schools, it is\r\nagain but natural that the system should call forth books adapted to its\r\npurposes; and it was scarcely possible, under the circumstances we have\r\nnow shown to exist, that such books should come forth without presenting\r\na more conscious aim toward embodying something of the principle and\r\norder of _discovery_ than has marked even their English prototypes.\r\nThese anticipations we find exactly realized in the first book of the\r\nnew pattern that has yet made its appearance--the 'Primary\r\nObject-Lessons' of Mr. Calkins. Of this book, issued June, 1861, the\r\nauthor thus states the motive: 'With an earnest desire to contribute\r\nsomething toward a general radical change in the system of primary\r\neducation in this country--a change from the plan of exercising the\r\nmemory chiefly to that of developing the observing powers--a change from\r\nan artificial to a natural plan, one in accordance with the philosophy\r\nof mind and its laws of development, the author commenced the following\r\npages.'\r\n\r\nAcknowledging his indebtedness to the manuals of Wilderspin, Stow,\r\nCurrie, the Home and Colonial School Society, and other sources, the\r\nauthor tells us that the plan of developing the lessons 'corresponds\r\nmore nearly to that given in Miss Mayo's works than to either of the\r\nother systems;' and we understand him to claim (and the feature is a\r\nvaluable one) that in this book, which is not a text-book, but one of\r\nsuggestive or pattern lessons for teachers, he directs the teacher to\r\nproceed less by telling the child what is before it and to be seen, and\r\nmore by requiring the child to find for itself what is present. Again,\r\nan important circumstance, the purpose of the book does not terminate in\r\ndescribing right processes of teaching, but on the contrary, _'in\r\ntelling what ought to be done, it proceeds to show how to do it by\r\nillustrative examples,' (sic.)_ Now, spite of some liberties with the\r\nPresident's English, which may properly be screened by the author's\r\nproviso that he does not seek 'to produce a faultless composition,' so\r\nmuch as to afford simple and clear examples for the teacher's use, we\r\nare compelled to inquire, especially as this is matter addressed to\r\nmature and not to immature minds, which it is the author really meant us\r\nto understand; that is, whether, in fact, the book 'proceeds to show\r\n_how to do it by_ illustrative examples;' or whether, in reality, it\r\ndoes not aim _to show by illustrative examples how to do it_--that,\r\nnamely, which ought to be done. If we still find Mr. Calkins's\r\nphilosophy somewhat more faultless than his practice, perhaps that is\r\nbut one of the necessary incidents of all human effort; and we can say\r\nwith sincerity that, in some of its features, we believe this a book\r\nbetter adapted to its intended uses--the age it is designed to meet\r\nbeing that of the lowest classes in the primary schools, or say from\r\nfour to seven or eight years--than any of its predecessors. It will not,\r\nwe hope, therefore, be understood as in a captious spirit, that we take\r\nexception to certain details.\r\n\r\nThe author is clearly right in his principle that 'The chief object of\r\nprimary education is the development of the faculties;' though doubtless\r\nit would have been better to say, _to begin_ the development of the\r\nfaculties; but then, he recognizes, as the faculties specially active in\r\nchildren, those of 'sensation, perception, observation, and simple\r\nmemory,' adding, for mature years, those of 'abstraction, the higher\r\npowers of reason, imagination, philosophical memory, generalization,'\r\netc. But that any one of all these is in the true psychological sense, a\r\n_faculty_--save, it may be, in the single instance of imagination--we\r\nshall decidedly question; and Mr. Calkins will see by the intent of his\r\nvery lessons, that he does not contemplate any such thing as 'sensation'\r\nor 'observation,' as being a faculty: but, on the other hand, that he is\r\nso regarding certain individual powers of mind, by which we know in\r\nnature Color and Form and Number and Change and so on.\r\n\r\nWe must question whether 'in the natural order of the development of the\r\nhuman faculties, the mind of the child takes cognizance first of the\r\n_forms_ of objects.' Form is a result of particular _extensions:_\r\nevidently, extension must be known before form can be. But again,\r\nvisibly, form is revealed through kinds and degrees of light and shade;\r\nin one word, through _color_. Evidently, then, color also must be\r\nappreciated before visible form can be. But this 'natural order of the\r\ndevelopment of the human faculties,' is a seductive thing. In phrase, it\r\nis mellifluous; in idea, impressively philosophical. It would be well if\r\nthis book, while cautiously applying developing processes to the little\r\nlearner, were to _dogmatise_ less to the teacher. But when the\r\ndevelopment-idea is carried into the titles of the sections, it becomes,\r\nwe think, yet more questionable. Thus, a section is headed, 'To develop\r\nthe idea of straight lines.' First, would not the idea of _a straight\r\nline_ come nearer to the thing actually had in view? Again, 'To develop\r\nthe idea of right, acute, and obtuse angles.' 'The idea,' taking in all\r\nthese things, must be most mixed and multifarious; it could not be\r\n_clear_, though that is a quality mainly to be sought. Is not the\r\nintention rather, to develop _ideas_ of _the right, the acute,_ and _the\r\nobtuse angle?_ Instances of this sort, which we can not understand\r\notherwise than as showing a loose way of thinking, are numerous. But\r\nthen, again, it is assumed that the lessons _develop_ all the ideas\r\nsuccessively discoursed about. Far otherwise, in fact. In many\r\ninstances, of course, a sharper, better idea of the object or quality\r\ndiscussed will be elicited in the course of the lesson. This is, at\r\nbest, only a sort of quasi-development, individualizing an idea by\r\nturning it on all sides, comparing with others, and sweeping away the\r\nrubbish that partly obscured it. In others of the topics, the learner\r\nhas the ideas before we begin our developing operations. But the great\r\nmisfortune of the usage of the term here is, that _develop_ properly\r\nimplies to _unroll, uncover, or disclose_ something that is infolded,\r\ncomplicate, or hidden away; but mark, something that is always THERE\r\nbefore the developing begins, and that by it is only brought into light,\r\nfreedom, or activity! Thus, we may develop faculties, for they were\r\nthere before we began; but we simply can not develop _objective ideas_,\r\nsuch as this book deals with, but must impart them, or rather, give the\r\nmind the opportunity to get them. First, then, this term thus employed\r\nis needlessly pretentious; secondly, it is totally misapplied. Would it\r\nnot help both teacher and pupil, then, if we were to leave this stilted\r\nform of expression, and set forth the actual thing the lessons\r\nundertake, by using such caption as for for example, _To give the idea,\r\nof a triangle,_ or to insure, or _to furnish the idea of a curve?_ We\r\nthink the misnomer yet greater and worse, when we come to such captions\r\nas 'To develop the idea of God, as a kind Father;' especially when the\r\namount of the development is this: 'Now, children, listen very\r\nattentively to what I say, and I will _tell you_ about a Friend that\r\n_you all have_, one who is kind to all of you, one who _loves you\r\nbetter_ than your father or your mother does,' and so on. All this, and\r\nwhat precedes and follows, is 'telling,' as the author acknowledges; of\r\ncourse, then, it is not developing. How is the child here made to _find_\r\nand _know_ that it has such a Friend?--that this Friend _is_ kind to\r\nall?--that this Friend loves it better than do parents, or, in fact, at\r\nall? This is the way the nursery develops this and kindred ideas, and if\r\nthe child be yet too young for its own comprehension of the most obvious\r\ntruths of Natural Theology, then better defer the subject, or at least\r\ncease to call the nursery method by too swelling a name!\r\n\r\nAs to arrangement of topics, though the geographical lessons properly\r\ncome late, as they stand, the idea of _place_, as well as those of\r\n_weight and size_, all belong earlier than the positions they are found\r\nin; and _number_, later. Such mental anachronisms as talking of _solids_\r\nbefore the attempt has been made to impart or insure the idea of a\r\nsolid, should, where practicable, be avoided; and more notably, such as\r\nbringing a subsequent and complex idea, like that of 'square measure,'\r\nbefore scarcely any one of the elementary ideas it involves, such as\r\n_measure, standard_, or even _length or size_, is presented. As to the\r\nsubstance of the teaching, we will indicate a few points that raise a\r\nquestion on perusal of them. What will the little learner gain, if the\r\nteacher follows the book in this instance? 'Where is the skin of the\r\napple? _On_ its surface.'' This is in the lesson for 'developing the\r\nidea' of surface. When, by and by, the young mathematician gets the true\r\nidea of a surface, as extension in two dimensions only, hence, without\r\nthickness, then will follow this surprising result, that the whole\r\nthickness of the apple-skin is _on_--outside--the apple's surface, and\r\nhence, is nowhere: a singular converse of the teaching of those smart\r\ngentlemen who waste reams of good paper in establishing, to their own\r\nsatisfaction, that even the mathematical surface itself has thickness!\r\nIn the lesson on 'perpendicular and horizontal,' the definition of\r\nperpendicular is correct; but all the developing, before and after,\r\nunfortunately confounds the _perpendicular_ with the _vertical_--a bad\r\nway toward future accuracy of thought, or toward making scientific\r\nideas, as they should be, definite as well as practically useful. If we\r\njudge by the brevity and incompleteness of the lesson on 'Developing\r\nideas of Drawing'(!), ideas of that particular 'stripe' must be scarce.\r\nThe Object Lessons at the close of the book we find generally very good\r\nmodels of such exercises, clear and to the purpose. Once in a while\r\nthere is a _lapsus_, as in this: The criterion of a _liquid_ is\r\npresented as being in the circumstances that it does not '_hold\r\ntogether_' when poured from a vessel, but 'forms drops.' Now, since it\r\nforms drops, it _has cohesion_, and the criterion is wrongly taken; In\r\nfact, the same thing appears in that the liquid, even in pouring out,\r\ndoes hold together in a stream, and a stream that experiments with\r\nliquid jets show it really requires considerable force to break up.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Calkins's book, in the bands of discerning and skillful\r\nteachers, can be made the instrument of a great deal of right and\r\nvaluable discipline for primary classes; but without some guarding and\r\nhelp from the teacher's own thought, it will not always do the best\r\nwork, nor in the best way. It is an approach to a good book for early\r\nmental development; but it is not the consummation to be desired. Many\r\nof its suggestions and patterns of lessons are excellent; but there is\r\ntoo large a lack of true consecution of topics, of accuracy of\r\nexpression, and of really natural method of handling the subjects. We\r\nsay this with no unkindly feeling toward the attempt or the author, but\r\nbecause, though no matter by how fortuitous circumstances, it comes to\r\nus as in this country the _first effort_ toward a certain new style of\r\nbooks and subjects, and certain more rational teaching; and we hold it,\r\nas being the privilege of teachers whose time may be too much consumed\r\nin applying, to criticise minutely, as no less our right and duty, and\r\nthat of every independent man, to recognize and point out wherein this\r\nnew venture meets, or fails to meet, the new and positive demand of the\r\npupils and the teachers in our time. If, in a degree, the working out\r\nshows defects such as we have named, is it not yet a question, whether\r\nwe have in the book an illustration 'how this system of training may be\r\napplied to the entire course of common school education'?--to say\r\nnothing now of the question whether, even in its best form, it is a\r\nsystem that ought to be so applied.\r\n\r\nAfter the author of a book for young learners is sure of the\r\ncomprehensibility of his subjects, and the accuracy of his ideas and\r\nexpressions of them, the highest need--and one the lack of which is\r\nfatal to true educative value--is that of a natural and true synthesis\r\nand consecution of the successive steps of fact and principle that are\r\nto be presented. We would not be understood that every successive lesson\r\nand every act of voluntary thinking must thus be consecutive: to say\r\nthis, would be to confine the mind to one study, and to make us dread\r\neven relaxation, lest it break the precious and fragile chain of\r\nthought. Our growth in knowledge is not after that narrow pattern. We\r\ntake food at one time, work at another, and sleep at a third: and so,\r\nthe mind too has its variations of employment, and best grows by a like\r\nperiodicity in them. This is our point--that it is a peculiarity and law\r\nof mind, growing out of the very nature of mind and of its knowings,\r\nthat no truth or knowledge which is in its nature a _consequent_ on some\r\nother truths or knowledge, can by any possibility be in reality attained\r\nby any mind until after that mind has first secured and rightly\r\nappreciated those _antecedent_ truths or knowings. No later or more\r\ncomplex knowledge is ever comprehensible or acquirable, until after the\r\nelements of knowledge constituting or involved in it have first been\r\ndefinitely secured. To suppose otherwise, is precisely like supposing a\r\nvigorously nourishing foliage and head of a tree with neither roots nor\r\nstem under it; it is to suppose a majestic river, that had neither\r\nsufficient springs nor tributaries. Now, for the pupil, the text-book\r\nmaker, the educator, no truth is more positive or profoundly important\r\nthan this. He who fails of it, by just so much as he does so, fails to\r\neducate. Let the pupil, as he must, alternately study and not study--go\r\neven on the same day from one study to a second, though seldom to more\r\nthan a third or fourth. By all this he need lose nothing; and he will\r\ntax and rest certain faculties in turn. But then, insist that each\r\nsubject shall recur frequently enough to perpetuate a healthy activity\r\nand growth of the faculties it exercises, usually, daily for five days\r\nin a week, or every other day at farthest; that each shall recur at a\r\nstated period, so that a habit of mind running its daily, steady and\r\nproductive round with the sun may be formed; and that in and along the\r\nmaterial of every subject pursued, whether it be arithmetic, or grammar,\r\nor chemistry, or an ancient or modern language, the mind shall so be\r\nenabled to advance consecutively, clearly and firmly from step to\r\nstep--from observation to law, from law to application, from analysis to\r\nbroader generalization, and its application, and so on--that every new\r\nstep shall just have been prepared for by the conceptions, the mental\r\nsusceptibility and fibre, gotten during the preceding ones, and that\r\nthus, every new step shall be one forward upon new and yet sure ground,\r\na source of intellectual delight, and a further intellectual gain and\r\ntriumph. Need we say, this is the _ideal_? Practice must fall somewhat\r\nshort of it; but Practice must first aim at it; and as yet she has\r\nscarcely conceived about the thing, or begun to attempt it. In truth,\r\nPractice is very busy, dashing on without a due amount of consideration,\r\nstriving to project in young minds noble rivers of knowledge without\r\ntheir fountains; and building up therein grand trees of science, of\r\nwhich either the roots are wanting, or all parts come together too much\r\nin confusion.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, we are not to make the presentation of any topic or lesson,\r\neven to the youngest learner, needlessly inconsecutive; but with the\r\nmore advanced learners--with those in the academic and collegiate\r\ncourses--we should insist on the display, and in so doing best insure\r\nthe increase of the true _robur_ of the intellect, by positive\r\nrequirement that all the topics shall be developed logically; that\r\nsufficient facts shall come before all conclusions; and rigid, sharp,\r\nand satisfactory analysis before every generalization or other\r\nsynthesis. So, the more advanced mind would learn induction, and logic,\r\nand method, by use of them upon all topics; it would know by experience\r\ntheir possibilities, requirements, and special advantages; and it would\r\nbe able to recognize their principles, when formally studied, as but the\r\nreflex and expression of its own acquired habitudes. Such a mind, we may\r\nsafely say, would be _educated_. But secondly, the foregoing\r\nconsiderations show that we are not unnecessarily to jumble together the\r\ntopics and lessons; to vacillate from one line of study to another; to\r\nwander, truant-like, among all sorts of good things--exploiting, now, a\r\n_color_; then _milk_; then in due time _gratitude_ and _the pyramids_;\r\nthen _leather_, (for, though 'there's nothing like leather,' it may be\r\nwisest to keep it in its place;) then _sponge_, and _duty to parents,\r\nlying_, the _points of compass_, etc.! And here, for all ages above nine\r\nor ten years, is a real drawback, or at the least, a positive danger, of\r\nthe Object-Lesson and Common-Things teaching. Just here is shadowed\r\nforth a real peril that threatens the brains of the men and women of\r\nthe--we may say, 'rising' generation, through this fresh accession of\r\nthe object-lesson interest in our country. _Objects_, now, are\r\nunquestionably good things; and yet, even objects can be 'run into the\r\nground.'\r\n\r\nWe had put the essential thought here insisted on into words, before\r\nobject-lessons had acquired the impetus of the last and current year.\r\n\r\n     'The 'object lessons' of Pestalozzi and his numerous followers, had,\r\n     in a good degree, one needed element--they required WORK of the\r\n     pupil's own mind, not mere recipiency. But they have [almost]\r\n     wholly lacked another element, just as important--that of\r\n     CONSECUTION in the steps and results dealt with. In most of the\r\n     schools in our country--in a degree, in all of them--these two\r\n     fundamental elements of all right education, namely, true work of\r\n     the learner's mind, and a natural and true consecution in not only\r\n     the processes of each day or lesson, but of one day on another, and\r\n     of each term on the preceding, are things quite overlooked, and\r\n     undreamed of, or, at the best, imperfectly and fragmentarily\r\n     attempted. But these, in so far as, he can secure their benefits,\r\n     are just the elements that make the thinker, the scholar, the man\r\n     of real learning or intellectual power in any pursuit.--_New-York\r\n     Teacher, December,_ 1859.\r\n\r\nA like view begins to show itself in the writings of some of the English\r\neducationists. The object-teaching is recognized as being, in most\r\ninstances, at least, too promiscuous and disorderly for the ends of a\r\ntrue discipline and development, and certainly, therefore, even for\r\nsecuring the largest amount of information. It too much excludes the\r\nlater, systematic study of the indispensable branches, and supplants the\r\ndue exercise of the reasoning powers, by too habitual restriction of the\r\nmind's activities to the channels of sense and perception. Isaac Taylor,\r\nin his _Home Education_, admits the benefits of this teaching for the\r\nmere outset of the pupil's course, but adds: 'For the rest, that is to\r\nsay, whatever _reaches its end in the bodily perceptions_, I think we\r\ncan go but a very little way without so giving the mind a bent _toward\r\nthe lower faculties as must divert it from the exercise of the higher._'\r\nThis thought is no mere fancy. It rests on a great law of _derivation_,\r\ntrue in mind as in the body; that inanition and comparative loss of one\r\nset of powers necessarily follows a too habitual activity of a different\r\nset. Thus it is that, in the body, over-use of the nervous, saps the\r\nmuscular energies, and excessive muscular exertion detracts from the\r\nvivacity of the mind. Logically, then, when carried to any excess over\r\njust sufficient to secure the needed clear perceptions and the\r\ncorresponding names for material objects and qualities, the\r\nobject-lesson system at once becomes the special and fitting education\r\nfor the ditcher, the 'hewer of wood,' the mere human machine in any\r\nemployment or station in life, where a quick and right taking to the\r\nwork at the hand is desirable, and any thing higher is commonly thought\r\nto be in the way; but it is not the complete education for the\r\nindependent mind, the clear judgment and good taste, which must grow out\r\nof habits of weighing and appreciating also thousands of _non_-material\r\nconsiderations; and which are characteristics indispensable in all the\r\nmore responsible positions of life, and that in reality may adorn and\r\nhelp even in the humblest. In a recently published report or address on\r\na recommendation respecting the teaching of Sciences, made by the\r\nEnglish 'Committee of Council on Education,' in 1859, Mr. Buckmaster\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     'The object-lessons given in some schools are so vague and\r\n     unsystematic, that I doubt very much if they have any educational\r\n     or practical value. I have copied the following lessons from the\r\n     outline of a large elementary school; Monday, twenty minutes past\r\n     nine to ten, Oral Lesson--_The Tower of Babel_; Tuesday, _The\r\n     Senses_; Wednesday, _Noah's Ark_; Thursday, _Fire_; Friday, _The\r\n     Collect for Sunday_. What can come of this kind of teaching, I am\r\n     at a loss to understand. Now, a connected and systematic course of\r\n     lessons on any of the natural sciences, or on the specimens\r\n     contained in one of Mr. Dexter's cabinets, would have been of far\r\n     greater educational value, and more interesting to the children.\r\n     _This loose and desultory habit of teaching encourages a loose and\r\n     desultory habit of thought_; it is for this reason that I attach\r\n     great value to _consecutive courses_ of instruction. I think, it\r\n     will not be difficult to show that the study of _almost any branch\r\n     of elementary science_ not only has a direct bearing on many of the\r\n     practical affairs of every-day life, but also _supplies all the\r\n     conditions necessary to stimulate and strengthen the intellectual\r\n     faculties in a much greater degree_ than many of the subjects now\r\n     taught in our elementary schools.'\r\n\r\nAll the lines of our investigation, as well as the most competent\r\ntestimony, thus converge in showing that the object-lesson and\r\ncommon-things teaching is but a partial and preliminary resource in the\r\nbusiness of education; that, to avoid working positive harm, it must be\r\nrestricted within due limits of age, capacity, and subject; that it is\r\nnot, therefore, the real and total present desideratum of our schools;\r\nand that, subsequently to the completion of the more purely sensuous and\r\npercipient phase of the mind, and to the acquirement of the store of\r\nsimpler ideas and information, and the degree of capacity, that ought to\r\nbe secured during that period--hence, from an age not later than eleven,\r\nor according as circumstances may determine, thirteen years--all the\r\ntrue and desirable ends of education, whether they be right mental\r\nhabits and tastes, discipline and power of the faculties, or a large\r\ninformation and practical command of the acquisitions made--all these\r\nends, we say, are thenceforward most certainly secured by the systematic\r\nprosecution, in a proper method, of the usually recognized distinct\r\nbranches or departments of scientific knowledge. Let then, 'common\r\nthings,' _et id genus omne_, early enough give place to thorough-going\r\nstudy of the elements of Geometry, of Geography, Arithmetic, Language,\r\n(including Grammar,) of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany,\r\nPhysiology, and something of their derivations and applications. Thus\r\nshall our schools produce a race not of mere curious _gazers_, but of\r\nconscious and purposive investigators; not a generation of intellectual\r\ntruants and vagabonds, but one of definitely skilled cultivators of\r\ndefinite domains in handicraft, art, or science.\r\n\r\nWe are compelled to take issue, therefore, with Mr. Spencer's\r\nrecommendation, indorsed in the Chicago Report, to the effect that\r\nobject-lessons should, after a 'different fashion,' 'be extended to a\r\nrange of things far wider, and continued to a period far later than\r\nnow.' Not so: after any possible fashion. But let us, as early as the\r\nchild's capacity and preparation will allow, have the individualized,\r\nconsecutive studies, and the very manner of studying which shall be made\r\nto do _for the higher and the lower intellectual faculties together,\r\nwhat well-conducted object-lessons can and now do perform, mainly for\r\nthe lower_. Of all school-method, this we conceive to be the true end\r\nand consummation. This would be the ultimate fruitage of the Baconian\r\nphilosophy, and of philosophy larger than the Baconian--by as much as\r\nthe whole is greater than any part--in the school-life and work of every\r\nboy and girl admitted to the benefits of our courses of instruction.\r\n\r\nThus we have endeavored, with some particularity of examination and\r\ndetail, to find and state not only what _are_, but what _should be_, the\r\ntendencies of educational thought and effort in our country and times.\r\nAnd we seem to find that those tendencies _are_, in spite of a\r\nstand-still conservatism or perplexed doubt in some quarters, and of a\r\nconflict of views and practices in others, largely in the direction in\r\nwhich the ends to be sought show that they _should be_. The _Education\r\nto be_, as far as the intellectual being is concerned, when time and\r\nstudy shall better have determined the conditions, and furnished the\r\nworking instrumentalities, is to be, not in name merely, but in fact, an\r\neducation by simply natural employment and development of all the\r\nperceiving, reasoning, originative, and productive faculties of the\r\nmind. It is to be such, because it is to insist on proceeding, after\r\nproper age, and then upon every suitable topic, by observation and\r\ninvestigation, and so, by discovery of the principles and results the\r\nmind is desired to attain; because it will be an education by rigidly\r\nconsecutive, comprehended and firm lines of advance, employing processes\r\nanalytic and synthetic, inductive and deductive, each in its requisite\r\nplace and in accordance with the nature and stage of the topics under\r\ninvestigation. For the like reasons, it will have become, what we have\r\nlong foreseen and desired that education should be, rightly progressive\r\nin form, and in character such as must develop, strengthen, and store\r\nthe mind; such as must best fit, so far as the merely scholastic\r\neducation can do this, for practical expression and use of what is\r\nlearned, showing all our acquired knowledge in the light of its actual\r\nand various relationships, and conferring true serviceableness and the\r\nlargest value, whether for enjoyment or execution.\r\n\r\nSuch an education would be _real_ in its method as well as in its\r\nsubstance. We have fairly entered upon the era in which education must\r\nbe, and, spite of any temporary recoil of timorous despotisms, must\r\ncontinue to be, popular and universal. But many are too apt to forget\r\nthat, upon our planet, this thing of popular and universal education is\r\ncomparatively a new and untried experience; that, so far as its mode and\r\nsubstance are concerned, it is, in truth, still in course of experiment.\r\nThere is at present a very general and but too just complaint of the\r\npopular education, as tending to inflate rather than to inform; as\r\nprompting large numbers of young men especially to aim at scaling to\r\npositions above those in which the school found them, a thing that would\r\nbe well enough were it not inevitable that, in the general scramble, the\r\npositions aspired to are at the same time too frequently those above\r\ntheir capabilities, and quite too full without them: as, in few words,\r\ninspiring youth with a disrelish for those less responsible pursuits to\r\nwhich a large majority should devote their lives, rather than with a\r\ndesire to qualify themselves for their proper work. The tendency is\r\nadmitted; and it has become, in overcrowded professions and commercial\r\npursuits, the fruitful source of superficiality, of charlatanry, of\r\npoverty at once of pocket and of honor, of empty speculations, and of\r\nthe worst crimes.\r\n\r\nBut, appreciating the unquestionable fact that universal education is to\r\nbe henceforth the rule in the most advanced nations, and that, in spite\r\nof its apparent consequences or our fears, and remembering also that the\r\nexperience is, for the world, a new one, is there not some hope left us\r\nin the thought that possibly the alarmists have been attributing to the\r\n_fact_ of popular education itself what in truth is only a temporary\r\nconsequence of a false, an abnormally-educating _method and procedure_\r\non the part of our schools? Nay, more; does not the latter afford the\r\ntrue solution of the evil? We believe it has been shown that our\r\nteaching methods not only fail in great part, but in a degree positively\r\nmis-educate; that the very 'head and front' of this failure and\r\nnon-developing appears in the want of bringing into just prominence the\r\ndiscriminating and the applicative powers of the mind, the judgment, and\r\nreason; in a word, the thinking as distinguished from the merely\r\nreceptive and retentive powers. Now, what are we to expect from a people\r\ntoo many of whom are put in possession of stores of fact quite beyond\r\nthe degree in which their capacities to discriminate clearly, to judge\r\nwisely, and to draw conclusions rationally have been strengthened and\r\nfurnished with the requisite guiding principles? What but a shallow\r\nshrewdness that should run into all the evils we have above named? But\r\ndiscipline all to think and reason more and more justly and assuredly\r\nupon their facts, and to men so educated, the very thought of an\r\ninordinate crowding of the so-called genteeler avocations, to the\r\nneglect of the more substantial, _becomes appreciated in its true light,\r\nas absurd and unfortunate in every way, and, in all its bearings upon\r\nthe individual as well as the social welfare_.\r\n\r\nSo, let us have popular education; and let a due proportion of fit minds\r\nenter the professions, the posts of office, and commercial pursuits; let\r\na few even live by mere work of thought; but let all enjoy the luxury of\r\na degree of thought and rationality that shall forbid their richest\r\nblessing turning to their rankest curse. That such must be the result of\r\na _true_ education, our faith in a wise Providence forbids us to doubt.\r\nSuch an education being _real_, and appealing to all the faculties, does\r\nnot eventuate in vain aspirings; but fits each for his place and\r\nwork--fits for making that great and happy discovery, that the best\r\ntalents and the most complete cultivation of them can not only find in\r\nevery employment scope for real exercise, but in the commonest and\r\nsimplest occupations will be more expert and successful than uncultured\r\nignorance can possibly be. In this view, the true education tends not to\r\n_level_ but to utilize, to make the most of every man's special\r\naptitudes for his special field. Such an education monarchy and\r\naristocracy might dread, and reäctive tendencies have already, indeed,\r\nblighted the once pattern school-system of Prussia, while they are\r\nbelieved to threaten a like step in England. But the idea of such an\r\neducation as we have striven to portray, harmonizes with the spirit and\r\nobjects of a commonwealth, and if we mistake not, to the perpetuity and\r\nperfection of free institutions it may yet be found the condition\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TRAVEL-PICTURES._\r\n\r\nA QUIET COURT IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nNo lodging on a village street could be quieter than my room in Paris,\r\nand yet the court it opened upon was not more than an easy stone's throw\r\nfrom the gayest part of the Boulevards. Once within the great wooden\r\ngate and up the narrow lane conducting to the court, and you seemed to\r\nhave left the great world as completely behind you as if it had been a\r\ndream. It was one of the smallest of Parisian courts, and--to me its\r\nchief recommendation--one of the neatest. With its two or three small\r\nstuccoed houses built around, it reminded one rather of inclosures that\r\nyou see in provincial towns in France than of the damp, high-walled\r\ncourts, so common in the capital. In one of these small houses, looking\r\nout upon the sunny, cheerful yard, I had my room, and as I often sat at\r\nthe window, I began by degrees to take some interest in the movements of\r\nmy neighbors, as we can hardly help doing when the same persons pass in\r\nand out before our eyes for many days in succession. The house was\r\nrented or owned by an elderly lady, who, with her niece and an old\r\nservant-woman, seemed to be its only occupants, with the exception of\r\ntwo American boys, attending school by day at one of the large\r\n_Pensions_ so numerous in Paris. Kinder people can not be found any\r\nwhere, and fortunate indeed is the sojourner in a strange land who falls\r\nin with such good hearts. Their history was a singular one, and I did\r\nnot really learn it till my return to Paris, after a long absence. They\r\ninterested me very much, from the first day. The lady and her niece had\r\nseen better days, and were notable partisans of the Orleans family,\r\nwhose memory they deeply reverenced. Politics, indeed, could make but\r\nlittle difference to them, passing, as they did, most of their lives in\r\ntheir quiet rooms; but such interest as they had in it clung to what\r\nthey considered the model royal family of Europe, a family that carried\r\nits affections and virtues equally through the saddest and most splendid\r\nexperiences. They could not sympathize with the oppressive and military\r\ncharacter of the present dynasty and the crowd of time-serving\r\nadventurers that swarmed around it. The life of the younger lady was\r\ndevoted to her aunt, and all the spare hours that remained to her from\r\nthose occupied by the lessons she was compelled to give, to increase\r\ntheir scanty income, were passed in her society. I have seldom seen a\r\nlife of such entire self-denial as that led by this refined and delicate\r\nwoman. The third figure of this family group, the old servant, Marie,\r\nwas a character peculiar to France. She seemed rather a companion than a\r\nservant, though she performed all the duties of the latter, keeping the\r\nrooms in neatest order, and making better coffee than I found at the\r\nmost splendid restaurants. She had a clear blue eye, with one of the\r\nmost faithful expressions I ever saw on human face, and seemed to take\r\nas much interest in me and the two American boys as if we had been her\r\nchildren. She was the housekeeper, buying all their little supplies; but\r\nwhen her labors were over, passing her leisure hours in the society of\r\nthe ladies she had so long served. I soon saw that the connection\r\nbetween these three beings would be terminated only by death. The chief\r\ndifference in the two ladies and their faithful old _bonne_, beyond the\r\ncircumstance of better education and greater refinement, was that for\r\nthe former the outer world no longer had much interest, while the old\r\nMarie still seemed to retain a keen relish for what was going on around\r\nher, and often amused me by the eagerness with which she would enter\r\ninto trifling details of gossip and general news. After sight-seeing all\r\nday, and the experiences of a stranger in Paris, I was often glad to\r\njoin the trio in their little parlor, and talk over the Paris of former\r\ndays, during its revolutions and _fétes_, or answer their questions\r\nabout my every-day ramblings or my American home. I felt, during these\r\nevenings, a relief from the general routine of places of amusement,\r\nenjoyed their home-like quiet, and knew I could always give pleasure by\r\nvarying the monotony of these ladies' every-day life. So the three, so\r\ndevoted to each other, lived quietly on, winning my respect and\r\nsympathy. I left them, with many regrets on their part and my own, and\r\non my return, after an absence of nearly a year, one of my first visits\r\nwas to these kind-hearted people. To my sorrow, I learned that death had\r\nremoved the elder lady some months before. I could hardly imagine a\r\ndeath that would longer or more painfully affect a family group than\r\nthis, for they had so few outward circumstances to distract their\r\nthoughts. They received me cordially; but grief for their irreparable\r\nloss was always visible in every subsequent interview I had with them.\r\nMeeting again one of the school-boys who had lodged there, he told me\r\nthe following circumstances of the death of the lady, and of the\r\nrelationship existing between them, which was so different from what I\r\nhad always imagined. Madame de B---- was the widow of a French officer\r\nof high rank, during whose life she had been in affluent circumstances;\r\nbut through various causes, she had lost most of the property left her\r\nat his death, and retained at last only enough to keep them in the\r\nhumble style I have described. The manner of her death was very\r\nsingular. In her better days, she had lived with her husband in a\r\nhandsome house near the Champs Elyseés. On the day of her death, she was\r\nwalking with a gentleman from Boston, a friend of the two pupils I have\r\nmentioned, and was speaking to him of her more affluent days, when, as\r\nthey were near the house where she had once lived, she proposed to walk\r\non a little further, that she might point it out. He consented, and as\r\nthey drew near to it, she exclaimed, '_Ah! nous l'apercevons_,' and,\r\nwithout another word, fell suddenly in a sort of apoplectic fit, not\r\nliving more than half an hour longer. The circumstance of this lady\r\ndying suddenly so near the place where she had once lived, and which she\r\nso seldom visited, was certainly very singular. To my surprise, I\r\nlearned that the younger lady was the daughter of old Marie, having been\r\nadopted and educated by the person she had always supposed to be her\r\naunt; she having no children of her own. What made it more singular was,\r\nthat the younger lady had herself been in possession of this family\r\nsecret only a few years. It reminded me somewhat of Tennyson's Lady\r\nClare, though in this case no one had been kept out of an estate by the\r\nfiction. It was merely to give the young lady the advantage of the\r\nsupposed relationship. This, then, accounted for the strong affection\r\nexisting between them, and lest any reader might think this conduct\r\nstrange, I must again bear witness to the kindness and true affection\r\nalways displayed toward the real mother. I would not narrate this true\r\nstory, did I not feel how little chance there is of my humble pen\r\nwriting any thing that would reach the ears of this family, living so\r\nobscurely in the great world of Paris.\r\n\r\nJust opposite us, in the court, lived another lady, who has played many\r\nfictitious parts, as well as a somewhat prominent one, on the stage of\r\nreal life. This was Madame George, the once celebrated actress; in her\r\nyounger days, a famous beauty, and at one time mistress of the great\r\nNapoleon. Though long retired from regular connection with the stage,\r\nshe still makes an occasional appearance upon it, almost always drawing\r\na full audience, collected principally from curiosity to see so noted a\r\npersonage, or to remark what portion of her once great dramatic power\r\ntime has still left her. One of these appearances was made at the Odéon,\r\nwhile we were in Paris. Marie informed us of the coming event before it\r\nwas announced on the bills, and seemed to take as much interest in it as\r\nif it had been the _débût_ of a near relative. We had sometimes caught a\r\nglimpse of the great actress, tending her geraniums and roses at the\r\nwindow, or going out to drive. On the evening in question, a very large\r\naudience greeted the tragedienne, and she was received, with much\r\nenthusiasm. She appeared in a tragedy of Racine, in which she had once\r\nbeen preëminently distinguished. Magnificently dressed, and adorned with\r\nsplendid jewels, trophies of her younger days, when her favors were\r\nsought by those who could afford to bestow such gifts, she did not look\r\nover thirty-five, though now more than twice that age. I am no admirer\r\nof French tragedy, but I certainly thought Madame George still showed\r\nthe remains of a great actress, and in some passages produced a decided\r\nimpression. Her tall, commanding figure, expressive eyes, and features\r\nof perfect regularity, must have given her every natural requisite for\r\nthe higher walks of her profession. As I watched her moving with\r\nmajestic grace across the stage, irrepressible though trite reflections\r\nupon her early career passed through my mind. What audiences she has\r\nplayed before, in the days of the first empire! How many soldiers and\r\nstatesmen, now numbered with the not-to-be-forgotten dead, have\r\napplauded her delivery of the same lines that we applaud to-night.\r\nNapoleon and his brilliant military court, the ministers of foreign\r\nnations, students such as are here this evening, themselves since\r\ndistinguished in various walks of life, have passed across the stage,\r\nand made their final exit, leaving Madame George still upon it. And the\r\nnot irreproachable old character herself--what piquant anecdotes she\r\ncould favor us with, would she but draw some memory-pictures for us!\r\nWomen in Europe, in losing virtue, do not always lose worldly prudence,\r\nas with us, and go down to infamy and a miserable old age. Better,\r\nhowever, make allowance for the manners of the time--French manners at\r\nthat--and contemplate the old lady from an historical point of view,\r\nregarding her with interest, as I could not help doing, as one of the\r\nfew remaining links connecting the old Napoleon dynasty with the new.\r\nHow strange the closing of a life like hers! Except for the occasional\r\nreäppearance on the scene of her old triumphs, not oftener than once or\r\ntwice a year, how quiet the life she now leads! what a contrast to the\r\nexcitement and brilliancy that mark the career of a leading actress in\r\nthe zenith of her reputation! _Then_, from the theatre she would drive\r\nin her splendid equipage through streets illuminated perhaps for some\r\nfresh victory gained by the invincible battalions of her imperial lover.\r\n_Now_, in a retired house, she probably sometimes muses over the past,\r\npronouncing, as few with better reason can, 'all the world's a stage,\r\nand all the men and women merely players,' such changes has she\r\nwitnessed in the fortunes of the great actors by whom she was once\r\nsurrounded. So here were the histories of two of the occupants of our\r\ncourt. The others may have had experiences no less strange; and in many\r\nanother court in this great city, from the stately inclosures of the Rue\r\nde Lille to the squalid dens of the Faubourg St. Antoine, (if the names\r\nhave not escaped me,) lives well worth the telling are passing away.\r\nSuch is a great city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY OF EUGENE ARAM\r\n\r\nThere is a little river in England called the Nidd, and on its high\r\nbanks stand the ruins of a castle. There is much in this part of it to\r\nremind one of the Rhine; the banks rise up in bold, picturesque form;\r\nthe river just here is broad and deep, and the castle enough of a ruin\r\nto lead us to invest it with some legend, such as belongs to every\r\nrobber's nest on that famous river. No hawk-eyed baron ready to pounce\r\non the traveler, is recorded as having lived here; all that seems to be\r\nremembered of it is, that the murderers of Thomas À Becket lay secreted\r\nhere for a time after that deed of blood, ere they ventured forth on\r\ntheir pilgrimage, haunted by the accursed memory of it all their lives.\r\nThis is something, to be sure, in the way of historic incident, but the\r\nreal interest of this immediate region arises from the fact of its being\r\nthe home and haunt of Eugene Aram. A great English novelist has woven\r\nsuch a spell of enchantment around the history of this celebrated\r\ncriminal, that I could not help devoting a day to the environs of the\r\nlittle town of Knaresboro', in and around which the most eventful\r\nportion of Aram's life was passed. A famous dropping-well, whose waters\r\npossess the power of rapidly petrifying every object exposed to them, is\r\none of the most noticeable things in the neighborhood. There are also\r\none or two curious rockcut cells, high up on precipitous slopes, which\r\nwere inhabited years ago by pious recluses who had withdrawn from the\r\nvanities of the world. Some were highly esteemed here in their lives,\r\nand here their bones reposed; and the fact of their remaining\r\nundiscovered sometimes for many years, was ingeniously used by Aram in\r\nhis defense, to account for the discovery of the bones of his victim in\r\nthe neighboring cave of St. Robert. This latter is one of the few places\r\nconnected with Aram's history that can be pointed out with certainty. It\r\nlies about two miles below the castle before mentioned. It is even now a\r\nplace that a careless pedestrian might easily pass without remarking,\r\nnotwithstanding that its entrance is worn by many curious feet. The\r\nentrance is very narrow, and the cavern, like caverns in general,\r\nexceedingly dark. The river flows by more rapidly here than above; the\r\ngrass grows long and wild, and there is a gloomy air about it that would\r\nmake it an unpleasant place for a night rendezvous even without the\r\nhorrid associations connected with it. The exact place where Clark's\r\nhones were discovered is pointed out, and probably correctly, as the\r\nspace is too narrow to admit of much choice. Here they lay buried for\r\nyears, while according to Bulwer, this most refined of murderers was\r\nbuilding up a high name as a scholar and a stainless reputation as a\r\nman. A field not far off is pointed out as the place where were found\r\nthe bones which led to the detection of Aram. Though but few places can\r\nnow be indicated with certainty in connection with his tragic story, a\r\nvague outline of the character of the man before the discovery of his\r\ncrime, is preserved in the neighborhood. As we read the true story of\r\nEugene Aram, lately published by an apparently reliable person, our\r\nsense of the poetic is somewhat blunted; we feel that the lofty\r\ncharacter drawn by Bulwer is in many respects a creation of the\r\nnovelist, while the whole story of his love is demolished by the stern\r\nfact of his having a wife, of no reputable character, with whom he lived\r\nunhappily; but he was still a man of talent, of great mental, if not\r\nmoral refinement, and of indomitable ardor in the pursuit of learning.\r\nThe chief fault of his character until his one great crime was\r\ndiscovered, seems to have been recklessness in pecuniary transactions,\r\nby which he was often involved in petty difficulties. He seems to have\r\nhad a tenderness amounting to acute sensibility, for dumb animals, and\r\nto have dreaded killing a fly more than many a man who could not, like\r\nhim, be brought to kill a fellow-being His mental acquirements, though\r\nremarkable for an unaided man of obscure origin, would not probably have\r\nattracted wide attention, had it not been for the notoriety caused by\r\nthe detection of his crime. How many fair girls have shed tears over\r\n'his ill-starred love' and melancholy fate, who little dreamed that he\r\nwas a husband, in a very humble rank of life. Bulwer speaks of his\r\nfavorite walks with Madeline, and of a rustic seat still called 'The\r\nLovers' Scat.' It is not, I think, now pointed out, nor is the account\r\nof his love probably more than an imaginary one, but it may be founded\r\nupon fact, and some high-souled English girl may really, in his early\r\nlife, or when separated as he was for a long time from his wife, have\r\ncalled forth all his better feelings and revealed glimpses of the beauty\r\nof the life of two affectionate and pure beings keeping no secrets of\r\nthe heart from each other. How it must have tortured him to think that\r\nsuch a life never could be his, well fitted for it as in some respects\r\nhe was, and ever haunted by the fear that the poor sham by which he was\r\nconcealed must some day be torn away, and an ignominious fate be\r\napportioned him! No situation can be more deplorable than that of a man\r\nof refined and lofty nature, who has made one fatal mistake connecting\r\nhim with men far worse than himself, who are masters of his secret and\r\never ready to use it for their own base purposes. Are there not many men\r\nso situated--men near us now, who walk through life haunted by the\r\ndreadful spectres of past misdeeds hastily committed, bitterly\r\nrepented--a phantom that can blast every joy, and from whose presence\r\ndeath comes as a friendly deliverer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ST. BERNARD.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Hospice about an hour after dark, somewhat stiff, and\r\nvery wet from the rain and snow that commenced falling as we entered the\r\nregion of clouds. We had passed unpleasantly near some very considerable\r\nprecipices, and though unable to distinguish the ground below, knew they\r\nwere deep enough to occasion us decided 'inconvenience' had we gone over\r\nthem. The long, low, substantial-looking building finally loomed through\r\nthe mist, and alighting, we were shown into a room with a cheerful fire\r\nblazing on the hearth, and were soon joined by a priest of cordial,\r\ngentlemanly manners and agreeable conversation. So this was the famous\r\nmonastery of St. Bernard, which we had read of all our lives, and the\r\nstories of whose sagacious dogs had delighted our childish minds. A\r\nsubstantial supper was provided for us, to which was added some\r\nexcellent wine, made in the valley below. Conversation was pretty\r\ngeneral in French, and somewhat exclusive in Latin; two of our party\r\nunderstanding the dead language, but ignorant of the living, framed with\r\ngreat difficulty ponderous but by no means Ciceronian sentences, which\r\nthey launched at our host, who replied with great fluency, showing that\r\nfor conversational purposes, at least, his command of the language was\r\nmuch better than theirs. Being anxious to attend the early mass in the\r\nmorning, and tired from our ride, we were soon shown to our rooms.\r\nWalking along the passages and viewing the different apartments, we saw\r\nthe house would accommodate a great number of persons. The rooms were\r\nlong and narrow, many of them containing a number of beds; but in this\r\nbracing mountain air there is no fear of bad ventilation. No crack of my\r\nwindow was open, but the wind blew furiously outside, and there was a\r\ndecidedly 'healthy coolness' about the apartment. The room was\r\nuncarpeted and scantily furnished, but every thing was spotlessly clean,\r\nand in pleasant contrast with the dirty luxury of some of the\r\nContinental inns. A few small pictures of saints and representations of\r\nscriptural subjects graced the white walls and constituted the only\r\nornaments of the room. Looking from my window I saw that the clouds had\r\nblown away, and the brilliant moon shone on the sharp crags of the hills\r\nand on the patches of snow that lay scattered about on the ground. The\r\nscene was beautiful, but very cold; the wind howled around the house,\r\nand yet this was a balmy night compared with most they have here. I\r\nthought of merciless snow-drifts overtaking the poor blinded traveler,\r\nbenumbed, fainting, and uncertain of his path; of the terrors of such a\r\nsituation, and then glancing around the plain but comfortable room, I\r\ncould not but feel grateful to the pious founders of this venerable\r\ninstitution. Long may it stand a monument of their benevolence and of\r\nthe shelter that poor wayfarers have so often found within its\r\nhospitable walls!\r\n\r\nAt daybreak we made our way to the chapel, a large and beautiful room\r\nwith many pictures and rich ornaments, gifts of persons who have shared\r\nthe hospitality of the place. At the altar the brother who had welcomed\r\nus on our arrival was officiating in his priestly robes, assisted by\r\nseveral others. A few persons, servants of the establishment and\r\npeasants stopping for the night, with ourselves, composed the\r\ncongregation. Two of the women present, we were told, were penitents; we\r\nasked no further of their history, but at this remote place the incident\r\ngave us cause for reflection and surmise. Heaven grant that in this\r\nsublime solitude their souls may have found the peace arising from the\r\nconsciousness of forgiveness. I have never been more impressed with the\r\nCatholic service than I was this morning, when the voices of the priests\r\nblending with the organ, rose on the stillness of that early hour in one\r\nof the familiar chants of the Church. It seemed, indeed, like heavenly\r\nmusic. Here with the first dawn of morning on these lofty mountaintops,\r\nwhere returning day is welcomed earlier than in the great world below,\r\nmen had assembled to pour forth their worship to God, here so manifest\r\nin his mighty works. The ever-burning lamp swung in the dim chapel, and\r\nit seemed a beautiful idea that morning after morning on these great\r\nmountains, the song of gratitude and praise should ascend to Him who\r\nfashioned them; that so it has been for years, while successive winters\r\nhave beat in fury on this house, and the snows have again and again shut\r\nout all signs of life from nature. As my heart filled with emotion, I\r\ncould not but think of the aptness to the present scene of those\r\nbeautiful lines of our poet:\r\n\r\n    'At break of day as heavenward\r\n    The pious monks of St. Bernard\r\n    Chanted the oft-repeated prayer.'\r\n\r\nTime and place were the same, and the service seemed as beautiful and\r\nsolemn as might have been that chanted over the stiff, frozen body of\r\nthe high-souled but too aspiring boy. The service ended, and we were\r\nleft alone in the chapel. In one corner of it is the box in which those\r\nwho can, leave a contribution for the support of the establishment. No\r\nregular charge is made, but probably most persons leave more than they\r\nwould at a hotel--and our party certainly did. I believe that the money\r\nis well applied; at any rate, for years the hospice afforded shelter\r\nbefore travel became a fashionable summer amusement, and in those days\r\nit expended far more than it received.\r\n\r\nOur breakfast was very simple, and the Superior of the establishment\r\nconfined himself to a small cup of coffee and morsel of bread. They have\r\nbut one substantial meal a day. I was interested in observing our host.\r\nHis appearance and manner were prepossessing and agreeable, but this\r\nmorning something seemed to weigh anxiously on his mind. He was\r\nabstracted in manner, and once as I looked up suddenly, his lips were\r\nmoving, and he half checked himself in an involuntary gesture. Had the\r\nconfession of the penitents, perhaps, troubled him? I believe he was a\r\nsincere, self-sacrificing man, and I have often thought of his manner\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\nWe were, of course, very anxious to see the dogs, but were told they are\r\nnow becoming exceedingly scarce. They can not be kept very long in the\r\npiercing air of the mountains, its rarefaction being as injurious to\r\nthem as to human beings. Most of them are therefore kept at Martigny, or\r\nsome other place below. We were told, however, that two 'pups' were now\r\nat the hospice; and as we sallied out for a walk over the hills, we\r\nheard a violent scratching at an adjoining door, which being opened, out\r\nburst the pups. They were perfect monsters, though very young, with huge\r\npaws, lithe and graceful but compact forms, full of life and activity,\r\nand faces beaming with instinct. Darting out with us, they seemed\r\nfrantic with joy, snuffed the keen air as they rushed about, sometimes\r\ntumbling over each other, and at times bursting against us with a force\r\nthat nearly knocked us down. They reminded me of two young tigers at\r\ntheir gambols. I have never seen nobler-looking brutes. What fine,\r\nhonest, expressive countenances they had! At times a peculiar sort of\r\nfrown would ruffle the skin around their eyes, their ears would prick\r\nup, and every nerve seem to be quickened. The face of a noble dog\r\nappears to me to be capable of almost as great a variety of expression\r\nas the human countenance, and these changes are sometimes more rapid.\r\nThe inquisitive and chagrined look when baffled in pursuit of prey, the\r\nkeen relish of joy, the look of supplication for food, of conscious\r\nguilt for misdemeanor, the eyes beaming with intense affection for a\r\nmaster, and whining sorrow for his absence, the meek look of endurance\r\nin sickness, the feeble, listless air, the resigned expression of the\r\nglassy eye at the approach of death, blending even then with indications\r\nof gratitude for kindness shown! These dumb brutes can often teach us\r\nlessons of meek endurance and resignation as well as courage, and few\r\nthings call forth more just indignation than to see them abused by men\r\nfar more brutish than they.\r\n\r\nAccompanying one of the younger brethren on an errand to the valley\r\nbelow, we watched them dashing along till the intervening rocks hid them\r\nfrom our view. In the extensive museum of the Monastery we found much to\r\ninterest us. Many of the curiosities are gifts of former travelers, and\r\nsome of them are of great value. There is also a small collection of\r\nantiquities found in the immediate neighborhood, where, I believe, are\r\nstill traces of an ancient temple. The St. Bernard has been a favorite\r\npass with armies, and is thought by many to have been that chosen by\r\nHannibal.\r\n\r\nNot very far from the house is the 'morgue' so often noticed by\r\ntravelers, containing numerous bodies, which, though they have not\r\ndecayed, are nevertheless repulsive to look upon. The well-known figures\r\nof the woman and her babe show that for once the warm refuge of a\r\nmother's breast chilled and fainted in the pitiless storm.\r\n\r\nAfter cordial well--wishes from the brethren, we left the hospice,\r\nbringing away remembrances of it as one of the most interesting places\r\nit has been our privilege to visit. It has, of course, changed character\r\nwithin half a century, and there is now less necessity for it than\r\nformerly. Many travelers complain of it as now wearing too much the\r\nappearance of a hotel; but we were there too late in the season to find\r\nit so; and even if true at other times, the associations with the\r\nMonastery and the Pass are so interesting, the scenery so bold, and the\r\nwelcome one meets with so cordial, that he who regrets having made the\r\nascent must have had a very different experience from ourselves.\r\n\r\nA few hours' ride brought us to the valley, where we met peasants\r\ndriving carts and bearing baskets piled up with luscious grapes. A\r\ntrifle that the poorest traveler could have spared, procured us an ample\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS OF STATEN ISLAND.\r\n\r\nStaten Island, that enchanting sea-girt spot in the beautiful Bay of\r\nNew-York, early became a favorite resort with the French Protestants. It\r\nshould be called the Huguenot Island; and for fine scenery, inland and\r\nwater, natural beauties, hill, dale, and streams, with a bracing,\r\nhealthful climate, it strongly reminds the traveler of some regions in\r\nFrance. No wonder that Frenchmen should select such a spot in a new\r\nland, for their quiet homes. The very earliest settlers on its shores\r\nwere men of religious principles. Hudson, the great navigator,\r\ndiscovered the Island, in 1609, when he first entered the noble river\r\nwhich bears his undying name. It was called by its Indian owners,\r\n_Aquehioneja, Manackong_, or _Eghquaous_, which, translated, means the\r\nplace of _Bad Woods_, referring, probably, to the character of its\r\noriginal savage inhabitants. Among the very earliest patents granted for\r\nlands in New-Netherland, we find one of June 19th, 1642, to Cornelius\r\nMelyn, a Dutch burgomaster. He thus became a Patroon of Staten Island,\r\nand subsequently a few others obtained the same honor and privileges.\r\nThey were all connected with the Dutch Reformed Church, in Holland; and\r\nwhen they emigrated to New-Netherland, always brought with them their\r\nBibles and the '_Kranek-besoecker_,' or 'Comforter of the Sick,' who\r\nsupplied the place of a regular clergyman. Twice were the earliest\r\nsettlers dispersed by the Raritan Indians, but they rallied again, until\r\ntheir progress became uninterrupted and permanent.\r\n\r\nBetween the Hollanders and the French Refugees, there existed an old and\r\nintimate friendship. Holland, from the beginning of the Middle Ages, had\r\nbeen the asylum for all the religious out-laws from all parts of Europe.\r\nBut especially the persecuting wars and troubles of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, brought hither crowds of exiles. Not less than\r\nthirty thousand English, who had embraced the Reformed faith, found here\r\na shelter during the reign of Mary Tudor. Hosts of Germans, during the\r\n'Thirty Years' War,' obtained on the banks of the Amstel and the Rhine,\r\nthat religious liberty, which they had in vain claimed in their own\r\ncountry. But the greatest emigration was that of the _Walloons_, from\r\nthe bloody tyranny of the Duke of Alba, and the Count of Parma. For a\r\nlong period the Reformed faith had found adherents in the Provinces of\r\nthe Low Countries. Here the first churches were _under the Cross_, or\r\n_in the Secret_, as it was styled, and they concealed themselves from\r\nthe raging persecution, by hiding, as it were, their faith, under mystic\r\nnames, the sense of which believers only knew. We will mention only a\r\nfew. That of Tournay, '_The Palm-Tree_;' Antwerp, '_The Vine_;' Mons,\r\n'_The Olive_;' Lille, '_The Rose_;' Douay, '_The Wheat-Sheaf_;' and the\r\nChurch of Arras had for its symbol '_The Hearts-Ease_.' In 1561, they\r\npublished in French, their Confession of Faith, and in 1563, their\r\nDeputies, from the Reformed Communities of Flanders, Brabant, Artois,\r\nand Hainault, united in a single body, holding the first Synod of which\r\nwe have any account. These regions were an old part of the French\r\nNetherlands, or Low Countries; and a small section of Brabant was called\r\n_Walloon_; and here were found innumerable advocates of the Reformed\r\nfaith. The whole country would probably have become the most Protestant\r\nof all Europe, were it not for the torrents of blood poured out for the\r\nmaintenance of the Roman religion by the Duke of Alba.\r\n\r\nWelcomed by the States General, Walloon Colonies were formed from the\r\nyear 1578 to 1589, at Amsterdam, Harlaem, Leyden, Utrecht, and other\r\nplaces. But new persecutions arising, the Reformed French retired to\r\nHolland, where new churches arose at Rotterdam, in 1605, Nimeguen, 1621,\r\nand Tholen, in 1658. It was natural, therefore, that the Huguenots of\r\nFrance should afterward settle in a country of so much sympathy for the\r\nWalloon refugees, whom they regarded as their brethren. When Henry III.\r\ncommanded them to be converted to the Romish Church or to leave the\r\nkingdom in six months, many of them repairing to Holland, joined the\r\nWalloon communities, whose language and creed were their own. After the\r\nfall of La Rochelle, this emigration recommenced, and was doubled under\r\nLouis XIV., when he promulgated his first wicked and insane edict\r\nagainst his Protestant subjects. From that unfortunate period, during a\r\ncentury, the Western Provinces of France depopulated themselves to the\r\nbenefit of the Dutch Republic. Many learned men and preachers visited\r\nthese Walloon churches, while endeavoring to escape the persecuting\r\nperils of every kind, to which they were exposed. Among the ministers we\r\nmay mention the names of Basnage, Claude, Benoit, and Saurin, who\r\nsurpassed them all, by the superiority of his genius, who was the\r\npatriarch of 'The Refuge,' and contributed more than all the rest to\r\nprevail on the Huguenots to leave France.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years of the seventeenth century, the French\r\nProtestant emigration into Holland rose to a political event, and the\r\nfirst '_Dragonades_' gave the signal in 1681. The Burgomasters of\r\nAmsterdam soon perceived the golden advantages which the Hollanders\r\nwould derive from the fatal policy of Louis XIV. The city of Amsterdam\r\nannounced to the refugees all the rights of citizenship, with an\r\nexemption from taxes for three years. The States of Holland soon\r\nfollowed the example of Amsterdam, and by a public declaration,\r\ndischarged all refugees who should settle there, from all taxes for\r\ntwelve years. In less than eight days all the Protestants of France were\r\ninformed of this favorable proclamation, which gave impulse to new\r\nemigration. In all the Dutch provinces and towns collections were taken\r\nup for the benefit of the French refugees, and a general fast proclaimed\r\nfor Wednesday, November 21st, 1685, and all Protestants were invited to\r\nthank God for the grace he gave them to worship Him in liberty, and to\r\nentreat him to touch the heart of the French King, who had inflicted\r\nsuch cruel persecutions on true believers.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange attached two preachers to his person from the\r\nchurch of Paris, and the Huguenot ladies found a noble protectress in\r\nthe Princess of Orange. Thanks to her most generous care, more than one\r\nhundred ladies of noble birth, who had lost all they possessed in\r\nFrance, and had seen their husbands or fathers thrown into dungeons, now\r\nfound comfortable homes at Harlaem, Delft, and the Hague. At the Hague,\r\nthe old convent of preaching monks was turned into an establishment for\r\nFrench women. At Nort, a boarding-house for young ladies of quality\r\nreceived an annual benefaction of two thousand florins from her liberal\r\nhands. Nor did she forget these pious asylums, after the British\r\nParliament had decreed her the crown. Most of the refugees came from the\r\nSouthern provinces--brave officers, rich merchants of Amiens, Rouen,\r\nBourdeaux, and Nantes, artisans of Brittany and Normandy, with\r\nagriculturists from Provence, the shores of Languedoc, Roussillon, and\r\nLa Guienne. Thus were transported into hospitable Holland, gentlemen and\r\nladies of noble birth, with polished minds and refined manners, simple\r\nmechanics and ministers of high renown, and all more valuable than the\r\ngolden mines of India or Peru. Thus Holland, of all lands, received most\r\nof the French refugees, and Bayle calls it 'the grand ark of the\r\nrefugees.' No documents exist, by which their numbers can be correctly\r\ncomputed, but they have been estimated from fifty-five to seventy-five\r\nthousand souls, and the greatest number were to be found at Amsterdam,\r\nRotterdam, and the Hague. In 1686, there were not less than _sixteen_\r\nFrench pastors to the Walloon churches at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThus intimately, by a common faith, friendship, and interest, did the\r\nHuguenots unite themselves with the people of Holland, who, about this\r\nperiod, commenced the establishment of New-Netherland in America. We\r\nhave traced this union the more fully for the better understanding of\r\nour general subject. The Walloons and Huguenots were, in fact, the same\r\npeople--oppressed and persecuted French Protestants. Of the former, as\r\nearly as the year 1622, several Walloon families from the frontier,\r\nbetween Belgium and France, turned their attention to America. They\r\napplied to Sir Dudley Carleton, for permission to settle in the colony\r\nof Virginia, with the privilege of erecting a town and governing\r\nthemselves, by magistrates of their own election. The application was\r\nreferred to the Virginia Company,[1] but its conditions seem to have\r\nbeen too republican, and many of these Walloons looked, toward\r\nNew-Netherland, where some arrived in 1624, with the Dutch Director,\r\nMinuit.\r\n\r\n[1: Lond. Doc. 1, 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first, they settled on Staten Island, (1624,) but afterward removed\r\nto _Wahle Bocht_ or the 'Bay of Foreigners,' which has since been\r\ncorrupted into Wallabout. This settlement extended subsequently toward\r\n'Breukelen,' named after an ancient Dutch village on the river Veght, in\r\nthe province of Utrecht; so that Staten Island has the honor of having\r\npresented the first safe home, in America, and on her beautiful shores,\r\nto the Walloons or Huguenots. The name of Walloon itself is said to be\r\nderived either from Wall, (water or sea,) or more probably, the old\r\nGerman word _Wahle_, signifying a foreigner. It must be remembered that\r\nthis is a part of the earliest chapter in the history of New-Netherland,\r\nwhich the 'West-India Company' now resolved to erect into a province. To\r\nthe Chamber of Amsterdam the superintendence of this new and extensive\r\ncountry was committed, and this body, during the previous year, had sent\r\nout an expedition, in a vessel called the 'New-Netherland,' 'whereof\r\nCornelius Jacobs of Hoorn was skipper, _with thirty families, mostly\r\nWalloons, to plant a colony there_.' They arrived in the beginning of\r\nMay, (1623,) and the old document, from which we quote, adds:\r\n\r\n     'God be praised, it hath so prospered, that the honorable Lords\r\n     Directors of the West-India Company have, with the consent of the\r\n     noble, high, and mighty Lords States General, undertaken to plant\r\n     some colonies,'[2] ... 'The Honorable _Daniel Van Kriecke-beeck_,\r\n     for brevity called _Beeck_, was commissary here, and so did his\r\n     duty that he was thanked.'\r\n\r\n     [2: Wassemaer's Historie Van Europa, Amsterdam, 1621-1628.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1625, three ships and a yacht arrived at Manhattan, with more\r\nfamilies, farming implements, and one hundred and three head of cattle.\r\nHitherto the government of the settlement had been simple, but now,\r\naffairs assuming more permanency, a proper 'Director' from Holland was\r\nappointed, and Peter Minuit, then in the office, was instructed to\r\norganize a provincial government. He arrived in May, 1626, and to his\r\nunfading honor be it recorded, that his first official act was to secure\r\npossession of Manhattan Island, by fair and lawful purchase of the\r\nIndians. It was estimated to contain twenty-two thousand acres, and was\r\nbought for the sum of sixty guilders, or twenty-four dollars! Lands were\r\ncheap then, where our proud and princely metropolis now stands, with her\r\nmillions, her churches, palatial stores, residences, and shipping.\r\n\r\nAs yet there was no clergyman in the colony, but two visitors of the\r\nsick, Sebastian Jansen Keol and Jan Huyck, were appointed for this\r\nimportant duty, and also to read the Scriptures, on Sundays, to the\r\npeople. Thus was laid, more than two hundred years ago, the corner-stone\r\nof the Empire State, on the firm foundation of justice, morality, and\r\nreligion. This historical fact places the character of the Dutch and\r\nFrench settlers in a most honorable light. They enjoy the illustrious\r\ndistinction of fair, honest dealing with the aborigines, the natural\r\nowners of the lands.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Manhattan, in 1626, was only imitated when William Penn,\r\nfifty-six years afterward, purchased the site of Philadelphia from the\r\nIndians, under the famous Elm Tree. The Dutch and Huguenot settlers of\r\nNew-Netherland were grave, firm, persevering men, who brought with them\r\nthe simplicity, industry, integrity, economy, and bravery of their\r\nBelgic sires, and to these eminent virtues were added the light of the\r\ncivil law and the purity of the Protestant faith. To such we can point\r\nwith gratitude and respect, for the beginnings of our western\r\nmetropolis, and the works of our American forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joannes Megapolensis, as early as the year 1642, took charge of\r\nthe Dutch Reformed Church in Albany, under the patronage of the Patroon\r\nof Renssaelaerwick, and five years afterward became 'Domine' at\r\nManhattan. In 1652, he selected for a colleague, Samuel Drissius, on\r\naccount of his knowledge of French and English, and from his letters we\r\nlearn that he went, once a month, to preach to the French Protestants on\r\nStaten Island. These were Vaudois or Waldenses, who had fled to Holland\r\nfrom severe persecutions in Piedmont, and by the liberality of the city\r\nof Amsterdam, were forwarded to settle in New-Netherland. We wish that\r\nmore materials could be gathered to describe the history of this\r\nminister and his early Huguenot flock upon Staten Island. His ministry\r\ncontinued from 1652 to 1671, and I have recorded all that I can find\r\nrespecting him and his people. About the year 1690, the New-York\r\nConsistory invited the Rev. Peter Daille, who had ministered among the\r\nMassachusetts Huguenots, to preach occasionally on Staten Island.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1661, a number of Dutch and French emigrants from the\r\nPalatinate obtained grants of land on the south side of Staten Island,\r\nwhere a site for a village was surveyed. In a short time its population\r\nincreased to twelve or fourteen families, and to protect them from the\r\nIndians, a block-house was erected and garrisoned with three guns and\r\nten soldiers. Domine Drissius visited them, and from a letter of his to\r\nthe Classis of Amsterdam, we learn the names of these early emigrants,\r\nand some are familiar ones[3], Jan Classen, Johannes Christoffels, Ryk\r\nHendricks, Meyndert Evertsen, Gerrit Cornelissen, Capt. Post, Govert\r\nLockermans, Wynant Peertersen, etc., etc. Previous to this period, the\r\nisland had been twice overrun by the savages and its population\r\nscattered; but now its progress became uninterrupted and onward. Crowds\r\nof people from Germany, Norway, Austria, and Westphalia had fled to\r\nHolland, and their number was increased by the religious troubles of the\r\nWaldenses and Huguenots. Several families of the latter requested\r\npermission to emigrate with the Dutch farmers to New-Netherland, at\r\ntheir own expense. They only asked protection for a year or two from the\r\nIndians; and the English, now in possession of the New-York colony, were\r\nmost favorably disposed toward them. This transfer from the Dutch to the\r\nBritish rule took place in 1664. Fort Amsterdam became Fort James, and\r\nthe city took its present name, imposed as it was upon its rightful\r\nowners. Staten Island was called Richmond County, and the province of\r\nNew-Netherland New-York, the name of one known only in history as a\r\ntyrant and a bigot, the enemy of both political and religious freedom.\r\n\r\n    [3: Alb. Rec. xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1656 to 1663, some Protestant emigrants from Savoy came to Staten\r\nIsland, and a large body of Rochelle Huguenots also reached New-York\r\nduring the latter year. This fertile and beautiful spot, with its gentle\r\nhills and wide-spread surrounding waters, became a favorite asylum for\r\nthe French refugees, and they arrived in considerable numbers about the\r\nyear 1675, with a pastor, and erected a church near Richmond village. I\r\nhave visited the place, but all that remains to mark the venerable and\r\nsacred spot is a single dilapidated grave-stone! The building, it is\r\nsaid, was burned down, and none of its records have been discovered. At\r\nthat period, there were only five or six congregations in the province\r\nof New-York, and this must have been one of them. The Rev. David\r\nBonrepos accompanied some of the French Protestants in their flight from\r\nFrance to this country, and in an early description of New-York, the\r\nRev. John Miller says: 'There is a meeting-house at Richmond, Staten\r\nIsland, of which Dr. Bonrepos is the minister. There are forty English,\r\nforty-four Dutch, and thirty-six French families.' In 1695-1696, letters\r\nof denization were granted to David Bonrepos and others. Among my\r\nautographs is a copy of his; he wrote a fair, clear hand.\r\n\r\nUnder the tolerant rule of 'Good Queen Anne,' many French refugees\r\nobtained peaceful abodes in Richmond county. In their escape from their\r\nown land, multitudes had been kindly received in England, and afterward\r\naccepted a permanent and safe shelter in the Province of New-York. What\r\na noble origin had the Staten Island Christian refugees! Their\r\nancestors, the Waldenses, resided several centuries, as a whole people,\r\nin the South of France, and like the ancient Israelites of the land of\r\nGoshen, enjoyed the pure light of sacred truth, while Egyptian darkness\r\nspread its gloom on every side. In vain have historians endeavored to\r\ntrace correctly their origin and progress. All, however, allow them a\r\nvery high antiquity, with what is far better, an uncontaminated, pure\r\nfaith. A very ancient record gives a beautiful picture of their simple\r\nmanners and devotions:\r\n\r\n     'They, kneeling on their knees, or leaning against some bank or\r\n     stay, do continue in their prayers with silence, as long as a man\r\n     may say thirty or forty _paternosters_. This they do every day,\r\n     with great reverence, being among themselves. Before meat, they\r\n     say, '_Benedicite_.' etc. Then the elders, in their own tongue,\r\n     repeat: 'God, which blessed the five loaves and two fishes, bless\r\n     this table and what is set upon it. In the name of the Father, Son,\r\n     and Holy Ghost. Amen.' After meat, they say: 'Blessing, and\r\n     worship, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, virtue, and strength,\r\n     to God alone, for ever and ever. Amen. The Lord which has given us\r\n     corporeal feeding, grant, us his spiritual life; and God be with\r\n     us, and we always with him. Amen.' Thus saying grace, they hold\r\n     their hands upward, looking up to heaven; and afterward they teach\r\n     and exhort among themselves.'\r\n\r\nTo Staten Islanders it must be a pleasant reminiscence, that among their\r\nearliest settlers were these pious Waldenses.\r\n\r\nLike their brethren in Utrecht, the descendants of the Huguenots on the\r\nIsland sometimes occupy the same farms which their pious ancestors\r\nobtained more than a century and a half ago. The Disosways, the Guions,\r\nthe Seguines, on its beautiful winding shores, are well-known examples\r\nof this kind. The Hollanders, Walloons, Waldenses, and the Huguenots\r\nhere all intermarried, and the noble, spiritual races thus combined,\r\never have formed a most excellent, industrious, and influential\r\npopulation. Judges, Assemblymen, members of Congress, and ministers,\r\nagain and again, in Richmond county, have been selected from these\r\nunions. During the Revolutionary struggle, the husband of Mrs. Colonel\r\nDisosway had fallen into the hands of the common enemy; she was the\r\nsister of the well-known and brave Captain Fitz-Randolph, or Randell, as\r\ncommonly called, who had greatly annoyed the British. When one of their\r\nofficers had consented to procure her husband's release, if she would\r\npersuade her brother to quit the American ranks, she indignantly\r\nreplied: 'If I could act so dastardly a part, think you that General\r\nWashington has but one Captain Randolph in his army?'\r\n\r\nThe early history of some of the emigrants is almost the reality of\r\nromance. Henri de La Tourette fled from La Vendee, after the Revolution,\r\nand to avoid suspicion, gave a large entertainment. While the guests\r\nwere assembled at his house, he suddenly left, with his wife, for the\r\nsea-coast. This was not far off, and reaching it, he escaped on board a\r\nvessel bound for Charleston. The ship was either cast away upon the\r\nshores of Staten Island, or made a harbor in distress. Here La Tourette\r\nlanded, and a long list of exemplary, virtuous people trace their origin\r\nto this source, and one of them has been pastor to the 'Huguenot,' a\r\nDutch Reformed church on the Island, and is now a useful minister among\r\nthe Episcopalians of the Western States. A branch of this family still\r\nexists at the chateau of La Tourette, in France, and some years since,\r\none of them visited this country to obtain the 'Old Family Bible.' But\r\nhe was unsuccessful, as the holy and venerable volume had been sent long\r\nbefore to a French refugee in Germany. But few of such holy books can\r\nnow be found, printed in French, and very scarce; wherever met with,\r\nthey should he carefully perused and preserved.\r\n\r\nDr. Channing Moore for a long time was the faithful pastor of St.\r\nAndrew's, the Episcopal Church at Richmond. Afterward he was consecrated\r\nthe Bishop of Virginia. He was connected by marriage with an old\r\nHuguenot family of the Island, and his son, the Rev. David Moore, D.D.,\r\nsucceeded him here, living and dying, a striking example of fidelity to\r\nhis most important duties. That eloquent divine, the late Rev. Dr.\r\nBedell, of Philadelphia, was a Staten Islander by birth, and of the same\r\nFrench origin on the maternal side.\r\n\r\nHis son is the present Bishop Bedell of Ohio. There are scarcely any of\r\nthe original Richmond county families but claim relationship to the\r\nFrench Protestants either on the father or mother's side. In all the\r\nofficial records are to be found such names as Disosway, Fontaine,\r\n(Fountain,) Reseau, Bedell, Rutan, Poillon, Mercereau, La Conte,\r\nBritten, Maney, Perrin, (Perrine,) Larselene, Curse, De Puy, (Depuy,)\r\nCorssen, Martineau, Morgane, (Morgan,) Le Guine, (Leguine,) Journey,\r\nTeunise, Guion, Dubois, Andronette, Winant, Totten, La Farge, Martling,\r\nDe Decker, (Decker very numerous,) Barton, Ryers, Menell, Hillyer, De\r\nGroot, Garretson, Vanderbilt, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nFew communities are blest with a better population than Richmond county,\r\nmoral, industrious, thrifty, and religious, and they should ever cherish\r\nthe remembrance of their virtuous and noble origin. The island is not\r\nmore than twelve or fourteen miles long, and about three wide, with some\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants; and within these small limits there are\r\nover thirty churches, of various denominations, each having a regular\r\npastor; and most of the official members in these congregations are\r\nlineal branches of the first settlers, the French Protestants. What a\r\nrich and glorious, harvest, since the handful of Holland, Walloon,\r\nWaldenses, and Huguenot emigrants, two centuries and a half ago, first\r\nlanded upon the wilderness shores of Staten Island!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECOLLECTIONS OF WASHINGTON IRVING._\r\n\r\nBY ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the first volume of the long-expected _Life of\r\nWashington Irving_ has excited an interest which will not be satisfied\r\nuntil the whole work shall have been completed. Its author, Pierre M.\r\nIrving, sets forth with the announcement that his plan is to make the\r\npatriarch of American literature his own biographer. It is nothing new\r\nthat this branch of letters is beset with peculiar difficulties. Some\r\nmen suffer sadly at the hand of their chronicler. Scott misrepresents\r\nNapoleon, and Southey fails equally in his Memoirs of Cowper and of the\r\nWesleys. Friendship's colors are too bright for correct portraiture, and\r\nprejudice equally forbids acuracy. Mr. Pierre M. Irving, though an\r\nadmirer of his distinguished kinsman, (and who that knew him could fail\r\nof admiration?) avoids the character of a mere eulogist, while at the\r\nsame time he exhibits none of the obsequiousness of a Boswell,\r\nfluttering like a moth about a huge candle. Being a man of independent\r\nmind and of high culture, he brings out the character he portrays in\r\naspects true to life, and not exaggerated by excess of tone, while he\r\nfully exhibits its exquisite finish.\r\n\r\nAmong the many incidents of deep interest which are contained in this\r\nvolume, the episode of Matilda Hoffman stands forth in most striking\r\nrelief. While lifting the veil which for a half-century covered the most\r\npathetic event in Irving's life, his biographer touches with a\r\nscrupulous delicacy a theme so sacredly enshrined in a life-long memory.\r\nIn referring to this affair, which gave a tender aspect to Irving's\r\nsubsequent career, and in fact changed its whole tenor, we may remark\r\nthat the loves of literary men form a most interesting and, in some\r\ncases, moving history. Some, like Petrarch, Earl Surrey, Burns, and\r\nByron, have embalmed the objects of their affection in the effusions of\r\ntheir muse, while others have bequeathed that duty to others. Shakspeare\r\nsays but little about his sweetheart, while Milton, who was decidedly\r\nunsuccessful in matters of the heart, seems to have acted on the motto,\r\n'The least said, the soonest mended.' Poor Pope, miserable invalid\r\nthough he was, nervous, irritable, and full of hate and spleen, was not\r\nbeyond the power of the tender passion, and confessed the charms of the\r\nlonely Martha Blount, who held the wretched genius among her conquests.\r\nSwift, although an ogre at heart, had his chapter of love matters, which\r\nnever fail to give us the horrors when we bring them to mind, and the\r\nepisodes of Stella and Vanessa are among the minor tragedies in life's\r\ngreat drama. Johnson had a great heart, and was born to love, though,\r\nlike the lion, he needed to have his claws pared, to fit him for female\r\nsociety. What a tender attachment was that which he bore 'Tetty,' and\r\nwith what solemn remembrance he preserved her as his own, even after\r\ndeath had robbed him of her presence!\r\n\r\nThe loves of these men exercised the strongest influence on their\r\ndestinies, while, on the other hand, disappointment and consequent\r\ncelibacy have done the same to their victims. To the bachelor list of\r\nmodern days, which can boast of Charles Lamb and Macaulay, America adds\r\nthe proud name of Washington Irving, whose early disappointment made him\r\nan author.\r\n\r\nMy impressions of Irving's boyhood and youth are alive with the\r\nfreshness of an early memory, which conserves along with him the\r\nCrugers, Clintons, Livingstons, Ogdens, and other old and honored names\r\nof New-York. The biography which inspires this reminiscence gives a\r\nsketch of the early history of the family, and as its author has thus\r\nopened the subject, it will not, we presume, be considered an intrusion\r\nif I pursue the thread of domestic incident a little farther than he has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe Irving homestead, in William street, was, in its day, a place of\r\nsome pretension, when contrasted with the humble dwellings which\r\nsurrounded it. The street on which it stood was miserably built, but\r\nhere, in the suburb of the city, was a house whose appearance\r\ncorresponded with the solid and high-toned character of its owner. Old\r\nMr. Irving was, at the time to which I refer, a hale citizen of about\r\nthree-score and ten, of grave and majestic bearing, and a form and\r\nexpression which, when once fixed in the mind, could not easily be\r\nforgotten. As I remember him, his countenance was cast in that strong\r\nmould which characterized the land of his birth, but the features were\r\noften mellowed by a quiet smile. He was a man of deep piety, and was\r\nesteemed a pillar in the Brick Church, then the leading Presbyterian\r\nchurch of the city.\r\n\r\nHis mode of conducting family worship was peculiarly beautiful, and even\r\nto his last days he maintained this service. On such occasions, it was a\r\nmost touching spectacle to see the majestic old man, bowed and hoary\r\nwith extreme age, leaning upon his staff, as he stood among his family\r\nand sung a closing hymn, generally one appropriate to his condition,\r\nwhile tears of emotion ran down his checks. One of these hymns we well\r\nremember. It runs in these lines,\r\n\r\n'Death may dissolve my body now,\r\n  And bear my spirit home;\r\nWhy do my moments move so slow,\r\n  Nor my salvation come?\r\n\r\n'With heavenly weapons I have fought\r\n  The battles of my Lord;\r\nFinished my course, and kept the faith,\r\n  And wait the sure reward.'\r\n\r\nIn a few years, the words of this exquisite hymn were fulfilled; the old\r\nman fell asleep, full of years and of honors, going to the grave like a\r\nshock of corn in its season. His funeral was one of imposing simplicity,\r\nand he was buried just at the entrance of that church where he had been\r\nso long a faithful attendant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Irving, who survived him several years, was of a different type of\r\ncharacter, which, by its peculiar contrast, seemed to perfect the\r\nharmony of a well-matched union. She was of elegant shape, with large\r\nEnglish features, which were permeated by an indescribable life and\r\nbeauty. Her manners were full of action, and her conversational powers\r\nwere of a high order. All of these graces appeared in the children, and\r\nwere united with the vigor of intellect which marked the character of\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nIt would have been surprising if the offspring of such a union should\r\nnot have been distinguished, and it is only the peculiar relation which\r\nthe biographer sustains to it which prevents him from bringing this\r\nfeature out more prominently.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, acknowledged, at an early day, that the family of\r\nWilliam Irving had no equal in the city, and when we consider its\r\nnumber, its personal beauty, its moral excellence, its varied talents,\r\nwithout a single deficient or unworthy member, we can not wonder at the\r\ngeneral admiration which it commanded. From the eldest son, William, and\r\nAnn, the eldest daughter, whom her father fondly termed Nancy, to\r\nWashington, the youngest, all were endowed with beauty, grace,\r\namiability, and talent, yet in the latter they seemed to effloresce with\r\nculminating fullness. Nancy Irving was the cynosure of William street,\r\nconcerning whose future destiny many a youth might have confessed an\r\nimpassioned interest. Her brother William had become connected\r\ncommercially with a young revolutionary soldier, (General Dodge,) who\r\nhad opened a trading-station on the Mohawk frontier, and the latter bore\r\naway the sister as his bride. The union was one of happiness, and lasted\r\ntwenty years, when it was terminated by her death. Of this, Washington\r\nthus speaks, in a letter in 1808: 'On the road, as I was traveling in\r\nhigh spirits, with the idea of home to inspire me, I had the shock of\r\nreading an account of my dear sister's death, and never was a blow\r\nstruck so near my heart before.... One more heart lies cold and still\r\nthat ever beat toward me with the warmest affection, for she was the\r\ntenderest, best of sisters, and a woman of whom a brother might be\r\nproud.' Little did the author of this letter then dream of that more\r\ncrushing blow which within one year was to fall upon him, and from whose\r\nweight he was never wholly to recover.\r\n\r\nWilliam Irving, the brother of the biographer, was a model of manly\r\nbeauty, and early remarkable for a brilliant and sparkling intellect,\r\nwhich overflowed in conversation, and often bordered on eloquence. Had\r\nhe been bred to the law, he would have shone among its brightest stars;\r\nbut those gifts, which so many envied, were buried in trade, and though\r\nhe became one of the merchant-princes of the city, even this success\r\ncould not compensate for so great a burial of gifts. As one of the\r\ncontributors to _Salmagundi_, he exhibits the keenness of a flashing\r\nwit, while, in subsequent years, he represented New-York in Congress,\r\nwhen such an office was a distinction.\r\n\r\nPeter Irving, like his brother, united personal elegance with talents,\r\nand conducted the _Morning Chronicle_, amid the boisterous storms of\r\nearly politics. This journal favored the interests of Burr; but it must\r\nbe remembered that at that time Burr's name was free from infamy, and\r\nthat, as a leader, he enjoyed the highest prestige, being the centre of\r\nthe Democracy of New-York. Burr's powers of fascination were peculiarly\r\ngreat, and he had surrounded himself with a circle of enthusiastic\r\nadmirers. Indeed, such was his skill in politics, that in 1800 he upset\r\nthe Federalists, after a pitched battle of three days, (the old duration\r\nof an election,) which was one of the most exciting scenes I ever\r\nwitnessed. Horatio Gates, of Saratoga fame, was one of his nominees for\r\nthe State Legislature, (Gates was then enjoying those undeserved laurels\r\nwhich posterity has since taken away,) and it was surprising to see the\r\nveterans of the Revolution abandoning their party to vote for their old\r\ncomrade and leader. The result was, that the Federalists were most\r\nthoroughly worsted, and the party never recovered from the blow. Such\r\nwere the exciting events which identified the young politicians of the\r\nmetropolis, and which inspired their speeches and their press. Burr's\r\nheadquarters were at Martling's Tavern, 87 Nassau street. On being torn\r\ndown, the business was removed to Tammany Hall, which has inherited a\r\npolitical character from its predecessor. Besides this, he used to meet\r\nhis friends in more select numbers at a Coffee-house in Maiden Lane. His\r\noffice was Number 30 Partition street, (now Fulton,) and his residence\r\nwas at Richmond Hill. This place has lately been pulled down; it stood\r\nfar away from the city, in a wild, secluded neighborhood, and in bad\r\ngoing was quite an out of the way spot, though now it would be in the\r\ndensest part of the city. As there were no public vehicles plying in\r\nthis direction, except the Chelsea (Twenty-eighth street) stage, which\r\nwas very unreliable, one either had to hire a coach or else be subjected\r\nto a walk of two miles. But such as had the _entrée_ of this\r\nestablishment would be well rewarded, even for these difficulties, by an\r\ninterview with Theodosia Burr, the most charming creature of her day.\r\nShe was married early, and we saw but little of her. From the interest\r\nwhich the Irvings felt in Burr's fortunes, it might have been expected\r\nthat they should sympathize with him in his subsequent reverses.\r\n\r\nThe biographer presents Washington Irving as an attendant at the famous\r\ntrial at Richmond, where his indignation at some of Burr's privations\r\nare expressed in a most interesting letter. This sympathy is the more\r\ntouching from the fact that Washington was a Federalist, and in this\r\nrespect differed from his brothers. We have an idea that his youthful\r\npolitics were in no small degree influenced by those of that\r\nillustrious personage for whom he was named. Another of the sons was\r\nJohn T., who became a successful and wealthy jurist, and for many years\r\npresided at New-York Common Pleas, while Ebenezer was established in\r\ntrade at an early day. Such was the development of that family, which in\r\nrosy childhood followed William Irving to the old Brick Church, and\r\nwhose early progress he was permitted to witness. The biographer passes\r\nlightly over the scenes of boyhood, and there was hardly any need for\r\nhis expatiating on that idolatry which surrounded the youngest. He was\r\nno doubt the first child ever named after the father of his country, and\r\nthe touching incident of Lizzie's presenting the chubby, bright-eyed boy\r\nto Washington, is hit off in a few touches. It was, however, in itself a\r\nsublime thing. Nearly seventy years afterward, that child, still feeling\r\nthe hand of benediction resting upon him, concludes his _Life of\r\nWashington_ by a description of his reception in New-York, of which he\r\nhad been a witness. Why does he not (it would have been a most\r\npardonable allusion) bring in the incident referred to above? Ah!\r\nmodesty forbade; yet, as he penned that description, his heart must have\r\nrejoiced at the boldness of the servant who broke through the crowd and\r\npresented to the General a boy honored with his name. Glorious incident\r\nindeed!\r\n\r\nAs the family grew up, the young men took to their different\r\nprofessions, which we have briefly designated. Peter read medicine, and\r\nhence received the title of 'doctor;' though he hated and finally\r\nabjured it, yet, as early as 1794, he had opened an office at 208\r\nBroadway. This, however, was more a resort for the muses than for\r\nHygeia, notwithstanding its sign, 'Peter Irving, M.D.' In 1796, William\r\nIrving, who had been clerk in the loan office, established himself in\r\ntrade in Pearl--near Partition--street, and from his energy and elegance\r\nof manners, he became immediately successful, while farther up the\r\nstreet, near Old Slip, John T. opened a law office, which was\r\nsubsequently removed to Wall street, near Broadway. We mention these\r\nfacts to show that Irving entered life surrounded by protecting\r\ninfluences, and that the kindness which sheltered him from the world's\r\ngreat battle had a tendency to increase his natural delicacy and to\r\nexpose him to more intense suffering, when the hand of misfortune should\r\nvisit him. One who had 'roughed it' with the world would have better\r\nborne the killing disappointment of his affections; but he was rendered\r\npeculiarly sensitive to suffering by his genial surroundings.\r\n\r\nThis fact sets off in remarkable contrast, the noble resolution with\r\nwhich such an one as he, when he had buried all the world held in the\r\ntomb with the dead form of his beloved, rose above his sorrows. It is\r\nwell observed by his biographer, that 'it is an affecting evidence how\r\nlittle Mr. Irving was ever disposed to cultivate or encourage sadness,\r\nthat he should be engaged during this period of sorrow and seclusion in\r\nrevising and giving additional touches to his _History of New-York_.'\r\nThose who may smile at the elegant humor which pervades the pages of\r\nthat history, will be surprised to learn that they were nearly complete,\r\nyet their final revision and preparation for the press was by one who\r\nwas almost broken of heart, and who thus cultivated a spirit of\r\ncheerfulness, lest he should become a burden to himself and others. As\r\nhe writes to Mrs. Hoffman: 'By constantly exercising my mind, never\r\nsuffering it to prey upon itself, and resolutely determining to be\r\ncheerful, I have, in a manner, worked myself into a very enviable state\r\nof serenity and self-possession.'\r\n\r\nHow truly has Wordsworth expressed this idea:\r\n\r\n  'If there be one who need bemoan\r\n    His kindred laid in earth,\r\n  The household hearts that were his own,\r\n    It is the man of mirth.'\r\n\r\nWe are glad to know that in time Irving sought a better consolation.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression, or rather anticipation of our\r\nsubject. At the time of which we now write, New-York was comparatively a\r\nsmall town; true, it was the chief commercial city in America, and yet\r\nits limits proper could be described by a line drawn across the island\r\nsome distance below Canal street. Yet even then New-York was full of\r\nlife, and seemed to feel the promise of subsequent greatness. Her\r\nstreets echoed to the footsteps of men whom the present generation, with\r\nall its progress, can not surpass. At Number 26 Broadway, might have\r\nbeen daily seen the light-built but martial and elegant form of\r\nAlexander Hamilton, while his mortal foe, Aaron Burr, as we have stated,\r\nheld his office in Partition street. John Jacob Astor was just becoming\r\nan established and solid business man, and dwelt at 223 Broadway, the\r\npresent site of the Astor House, and which was one of the earliest\r\npurchases which led to the greatest landed estate in America. Robert\r\nLenox lived in Broadway, near Trinity Church, and was building up that\r\nsplendid commerce which has made his son one of the chief city\r\ncapitalists. De Witt Clinton was a young and ambitious lawyer, full of\r\npromise, whose office (he was just elected Mayor) was Number 1 Broadway.\r\nCadwallader D. Colden was pursuing his brilliant career, and might be\r\nfound immersed in law at Number 59 Wall street. Such were the legal and\r\npolitical magnates of the day; while to slake the thirst of their\r\nexcited followers, Medcef Eden brewed ale in Gold street, and Janeway\r\ncarried on the same business in Magazine street; and his empty\r\nestablishment became notorious, in later years, as the 'Old Brewery.'\r\n\r\nAbout this time young Irving was developing as one of the most\r\ninteresting youth of the city. His manners were soft without being\r\neffeminate, his form finely molded, and his countenance singularly\r\nbeautiful. To this might be added the general opinion that he was\r\nconsiderably gifted in the use of the pen. Yet with all these promising\r\nfeatures, the future was clothed with shadows, for his health was\r\nfailing, and his friends considered him too lovely a flower to last.\r\nLittle did his brothers and sisters think that that delicate youth\r\nwould, with one exception, outlive the whole family. It was at this time\r\nthat he first went abroad; and his experiences of travel are given by\r\nPierre Irving in the sparkling letters which he wrote to his brothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 I used to meet him once more in social gatherings in the city,\r\nfor he had returned in full restoration of health, his mind expanded,\r\nand his manners improved by intercourse with the European world, while\r\n_Salmagundi_ had electrified the city and given him the first rank among\r\nits satirists. The question of profession crowded on him, and he\r\nalternated between the law and the counting-room, in either of which he\r\nmight find one or more of his brothers. The former of these was a road\r\nto distinction, the latter was one to wealth; but feeling the absence of\r\npractical business gifts, he shrank from trade, and took refuge in the\r\nquiet readings of an office. Josiah Ogden Hoffman, of whose daughter so\r\nmuch has recently been written, was a family friend, as well as a lawyer\r\nof high character. He lived first at Number 68 Greenwich street, but\r\nafterward moved up-town, his office being in Wall street, first Number\r\n47, and afterward Number 16. Young Irving finished his studies with Mr.\r\nHoffman, and immediately took office with his brother John, at Number 3\r\nWall street. To these two was soon added the presence of Peter, who was\r\nstill connected with the press, and thus might have been found for a\r\nshort time a most interesting and talented, as well as fraternal trio.\r\n\r\nWashington was still, to a considerable degree an _habitué_ of Mr.\r\nHoffman's office, and it seems quite amusing that one who was so dull at\r\nreading law that he makes merry with his own deficiencies, should have a\r\nconnection with two offices. But the name of Matilda was the magnet\r\nwhich drew him to one where he vainly struggled to climb Alp on Alp of\r\ndifficulties in hope of love's fruition, while at the other he might\r\nsmile at the bewilderments of Coke, brush away the cobwebs from his\r\nbrain, and recreate himself with the rich humors of _Salmagundi_.\r\n\r\nThe place and time where this remarkable attachment had its inception,\r\nare not known; but like all such affairs, it arose, no doubt, from\r\nfelicitous accident. In one of his sketches, Irving speaks of a\r\nmysterious footprint seen on the sward of the Battery, which awoke a\r\nromantic interest in his breast. This youthful incident comes to our\r\nmind when we remember that Mr. Hoffman lived at Number 68 Greenwich\r\nstreet, not a stone's throw from the Battery, and we have sometimes\r\nthought that the mysterious footprint might have been Matilda's. At any\r\nrate, the Battery was at that day a place of fashionable resort, and\r\nhence the fair but fragile form of Matilda Hoffman could almost any day\r\nhave been seen tripping among bevies of city girls in pursuit of health\r\nor pleasure. But whatever be the history of its origin, the attachment\r\nbecame one of mutual strength; and while young Irving was surrounded by\r\npiles of lawbooks and red tape, his hope of success was identified with\r\nthe name of Matilda. My remembrance of Matilda (her name was Sarah\r\nMatilda, but the first was dropped in common intercourse) revives a\r\ncountenance of great sweetness, and an indescribable beauty of\r\nexpression. Her auburn hair played carelessly in the wind, and her\r\nfeatures, though not of classic outline, were radiant with life. Her eye\r\nwas one of the finest I have ever seen--rich, deep-toned, and eloquent,\r\nspeaking volumes in each varying expression, and generally suggestive of\r\npensive emotion. Irving was about eight years her senior, and this\r\ndifference was just sufficient to draw out that fond reliance of female\r\ncharacter which he has so beautifully set forth in the sketch of 'The\r\nWife.' The brief period of this courtship was the sunny hour of his\r\nlife, for his tender and sensitive nature forbade any thing but the most\r\nardent attachment. What dreams of future bliss floated before his\r\nintoxicated vision, soon to change to the stern realities of grieving\r\nsorrow!\r\n\r\nIn 1809, Mr. Hoffman removed to a suburban residence in Broadway,\r\n(corner of Leonard street,) and the frequent walks which the young lover\r\ntook up that sequestered avenue may have suggested some of the\r\ndescriptions of the same street in the pages of the _History of\r\nNew-York_, and his allusions to the front-gardens so adapted to ancient\r\ncourtship. While at this mansion, amid all the blandishments of hope,\r\nMatilda's health began to fail beyond the power of restoratives, and the\r\nanxious eye both of parent and betrothed, marked the advance of\r\nrelentless disease. The maiden faded away from their affections until\r\nboth stood by her bed and saw her breathe her last.\r\n\r\nThe biographer informs us that after Mr. Irving's death, there was found\r\nin a repository of which he always kept the key, a memorial of this\r\naffair, which had evidently been written to some friend, in explanation\r\nof his single life. Of the memorial the following extract is given:\r\n\r\n     'We saw each other every day, and I became excessively attached to\r\n     her. Her shyness wore off by degrees. The more I saw of her the\r\n     more I had reason to admire her. Her mind seemed to unfold itself\r\n     leaf by leaf, and every time to discover new sweetness. Nobody knew\r\n     her so well as I, for she was generally timid and silent, but I, in\r\n     a manner, studied her excellence. Never did I meet more intuitive\r\n     rectitude of mind, more native delicacy, more exquisite propriety\r\n     in word, thought, or action, than in this young creature. I am not\r\n     exaggerating; what I say was acknowledged by all who knew her. Her\r\n     brilliant little sister used to say that people began by admiring\r\n     her, but ended by loving Matilda. For my part, I idolized her. I\r\n     felt at times rebuked by her superior delicacy and purity, as if I\r\n     was a coarse, unworthy being, in comparison.\r\n\r\n     'This passion was terribly against my studies. I felt my own\r\n     deficiency, and despaired of ever succeeding at the bar. I could\r\n     study any thing else rather than law, and had a fatal propensity to\r\n     belles-lettres. I had gone on blindly like a boy in love, but now\r\n     I began to open my eyes and be miserable. I had nothing in purse or\r\n     in expectation. I anticipated nothing from my legal pursuits, and\r\n     had done nothing to make me hope for public employment, or\r\n     political elevation. I had begun a satirical and humorous work,\r\n     (_The History of New-York_,) in company with one of my brothers;\r\n     but he had gone to Europe shortly after commencing it, and my\r\n     feelings had run in so different a vein that I could not go on with\r\n     it. I became low-spirited and disheartened, and did not know what\r\n     was to become of me. I made frequent attempts to apply myself to\r\n     the law; but it is a slow and tedious undertaking for a young man\r\n     to get into practice, and I had, unluckily, no turn for business.\r\n     The gentleman with whom I studied saw the state of my mind. He had\r\n     an affectionate regard for me--a paternal one, I may say. He had a\r\n     better opinion of my legal capacity than it merited. He urged me to\r\n     return to my studies, to apply myself, to become well acquainted\r\n     with the law, and that in case I could make myself capable of\r\n     undertaking legal concerns, he would take me into partnership with\r\n     him and give me his daughter. Nothing could be more generous. I set\r\n     to work with zeal to study anew, and I considered myself bound in\r\n     honor not to make farther advances with the daughter until I should\r\n     feel satisfied with my proficiency with the law. It was all in\r\n     vain. I had an insuperable repugnance to the study; my mind would\r\n     not take hold of it; or rather, by long despondency had become for\r\n     the time incapable of any application. I was in a wretched state of\r\n     doubt and self-distrust. I tried to finish the work which I was\r\n     secretly writing, hoping it would give me reputation and gain me\r\n     some public employment. In the mean time I saw Matilda every day,\r\n     and that helped distract me. In the midst of this struggle and\r\n     anxiety, she was taken ill with a cold. Nothing was thought of it\r\n     at first, but she grew rapidly worse, and fell into a consumption.\r\n     I can not tell you what I suffered. The ills that I have undergone\r\n     in this life have been dealt out to me drop by drop, and I have\r\n     tasted all their bitterness. I saw her fade rapidly away--beautiful\r\n     and more beautiful, and more angelic to the very last. I was often\r\n     by her bedside, and in her wandering state of mind she would talk\r\n     to me with a sweet, natural, and affecting eloquence that was\r\n     overpowering. I saw more of the beauty of her mind in that\r\n     delirious state than I had ever known before. Her malady was rapid\r\n     in its career, and hurried her off in two months. Her\r\n     dying-struggles were painful and protracted. For three days and\r\n     nights I did not leave the house, and scarcely slept. I was by her\r\n     when she died. All the family were assembled around her, some\r\n     praying, others weeping, for she was adored by them all. I was the\r\n     last one she looked upon. I have told you as briefly as I could,\r\n     what, if I were to tell with all the incidents and feelings that\r\n     accompanied it, would fill volumes. She was but seventeen years old\r\n     when she died.\r\n\r\n     'I can not tell you what a horrid state of mind I was in for a long\r\n     time. I seemed to care for nothing; the world was a blank to me. I\r\n     abandoned all thoughts of the law. I went into the country, but\r\n     could not bear solitude, yet could not enjoy society. There was a\r\n     dismal horror continually on my mind that made me fear to be alone.\r\n     I had often to get up in the night and seek the bedroom of my\r\n     brother, as if the having of a human being by me would relieve me\r\n     from the frightful gloom of my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n     'Months elapsed before my mind would resume any tone, but the\r\n     despondency I had suffered for a long time in the course of this\r\n     attachment, and the anguish that attended its final catastrophe,\r\n     seemed to give a turn to my whole character, and threw some clouds\r\n     into my disposition, which have ever since hung about it. When I\r\n     became more calm and collected, I applied myself, by way of\r\n     occupation, to the finishing of my work. I brought it to a close as\r\n     well as I could, and published it; but the time and circumstances\r\n     in which it was produced rendered me always unable to look upon it\r\n     with satisfaction. Still, it took with the public, and gave me\r\n     celebrity, as an original work was something remarkable and\r\n     uncommon in America. I was noticed, caressed, and for a time\r\n     elevated by the popularity I had gained. Wherever I went, I was\r\n     overwhelmed with attentions. I was full of youth and animation, far\r\n     different from the being I now am, and I was quite flushed with\r\n     this early taste of public favor. Still, however, the career of\r\n     gayety and notoriety soon palled upon me. I seemed to drift about\r\n     without aim or object, at the mercy of every breeze; my heart\r\n     wanted anchorage. I was naturally susceptible, and tried to form\r\n     other attachments, but my heart would not hold on. It would\r\n     continually revert to what it had lost; and whenever there was a\r\n     pause in the hurry of novelty and excitement, I would sink into\r\n     dismal dejection. For years I could not talk on the subject of this\r\n     hopeless regret; I could not even mention her name; but her image\r\n     was continually before me, and I dreamed of her incessantly.'\r\n\r\nThe fragment of which the above is an extract, is doubly interesting as\r\nnot only clearing up a mystery which the world has long desired to\r\npenetrate, but also as giving Irving's experience in his own words. It\r\nproves how deeply he felt the pangs of a rooted sorrow, and how\r\nimpossible it was, amid all the attractions of society, for him to\r\nescape the power of one who had bidden to all earthly societies an\r\neverlasting farewell. That his regrets over his early bereavement did\r\nnot arise from overwrought dreams of excellence in the departed, is\r\nevident from the character she bore with others; and this is illustrated\r\nby the following extract from a faded copy of the _Commercial\r\nAdvertiser_, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     'OBITUARY,\r\n\r\n     'Died, on the 26th instant, in the eighteenth year of her age, Miss\r\n     Sarah Matilda Hoffman, daughter of Josiah Ogden Hoffman. Thus\r\n     another youthful and lovely victim is added to the ravages of that\r\n     relentless and invincible enemy to earthly happiness, the\r\n     _consumption_. In the month of January we beheld this amiable and\r\n     interesting girl in the glow of health and spirits, the delight of\r\n     her friends, the joy and pride of her family; she is now cold and\r\n     lifeless as the clod of the valley. So falls the tender flower of\r\n     spring as it expands its bosom to the chilling blight of the\r\n     morning frost. Endowed by nature with a mind unusually\r\n     discriminating, and a docility of temper and disposition admirably\r\n     calculated to reap profit from instruction, Miss Hoffman very early\r\n     became an object of anxious care and solicitude to the fondest of\r\n     fathers. That care and solicitude he soon found richly rewarded by\r\n     the progress she made in her learning, and by every evidence of a\r\n     grateful and feeling heart. After completing the course of her\r\n     education in a highly respectable seminary in Philadelphia, she\r\n     returned to her father's house, where she diligently sought every\r\n     opportunity to improve her mind by various and useful reading. She\r\n     charmed the circle of her friends by the suavity of her disposition\r\n     and the most gentle and engaging manners. She delighted and blessed\r\n     her own family by her uniformly correct and affectionate conduct.\r\n     Though not formed to mingle and shine in the noisy haunts of\r\n     dissipation, she was eminently fitted to increase the store of\r\n     domestic happiness, to bring pleasure and tranquillity to the\r\n     fireside, and to gladden the fond heart of a parent.\r\n\r\n     'Religion, so necessary to our peace in this world and to our\r\n     happiness in the next, and which gives so high a lustre to the\r\n     charms and to the virtues of woman, constantly shed her benign\r\n     influence over the conduct of Miss Hoffman, nor could the insidious\r\n     attempts of the infidel for a moment weaken her confidence in its\r\n     heavenly doctrines. With a form rather slender and fragile was\r\n     united a beauty of face, which, though not dazzling, had so much\r\n     softness, such a touching sweetness in it, that the expression\r\n     which mantled over her features was in a high degree lovely and\r\n     interesting. Her countenance was indeed the faithful image of a\r\n     mind that was purity itself, and of a heart where compassion and\r\n     goodness had fixed their abode. To the sweetest disposition that\r\n     ever graced a woman, was joined a sensibility, not the fictitious\r\n     creature of the imagination, but the glowing offspring of a pure\r\n     and affectionate soul.\r\n\r\n     'Tenderness, that quality of the heart which gives such a charm to\r\n     every female virtue, was hers in an eminent degree. It diffused\r\n     itself over every action of her life. Sometimes blended with a\r\n     delicate and happy humor, characteristic of her nature, it would\r\n     delight the social circle; again, with the most assiduous offices\r\n     of affection, it would show itself at the sick couch of a parent, a\r\n     relative, or a friend. In this manner the writer of this brief\r\n     memorial witnessed those soothing acts of kindness which, under\r\n     peculiar circumstances, will ever be dear to his memory. Alas!\r\n     little did she then dream that in one short year she herself would\r\n     fall a sacrifice to the same disease under which the friend to whom\r\n     she so kindly ministered, sunk to the grave.'\r\n\r\nThis testimony to departed worth bears the impress of deep sincerity,\r\nand its freedom from the fulsome praise, which so often varnishes the\r\ndead, seems to add to its force. Peter Irving, also, pays a tribute to\r\nher character in the following utterance, in a letter to his bereaved\r\nbrother: 'May her gentle spirit have found that heaven to which it ever\r\nseemed to appertain. She was too spotless for this contaminated world.'\r\n\r\nThe biographer states that 'Mr. Irving never alluded to this event, nor\r\ndid any of his relatives ever venture in his presence to introduce the\r\nname of Matilda,' 'I have heard,' he adds, 'of but one instance in which\r\nit was ever obtruded upon him, and that was by her father, nearly thirty\r\nyears after her death, and at his own house. A granddaughter had been\r\nrequested to play for him some favorite piece on the piano, and in\r\nextricating her music from the drawer, she accidentally brought forth a\r\npiece of embroidery with it. 'Washington,' said Mr. Hoffman, picking up\r\nthe faded relic, 'this is a piece of poor Matilda's workmanship.' The\r\neffect was electric. He had been conversing in the sprightliest mood\r\nbefore, but he sunk at once into utter silence, and in a few moments got\r\nup and left the house. It is evidence with what romantic tenderness\r\nIrving cherished the memory of this early love, that he kept by him\r\nthrough life the Bible and Prayer-Book of Matilda. He lay with them\r\nunder his pillow in the first days of keen and vivid anguish that\r\nfollowed her loss, and they were ever afterward, in all changes of\r\nclimate and country, his inseparable companions.'\r\n\r\nThe scene at the house of Mr. Hoffman, to which the biographer alludes,\r\ntook place after Irving's second return from Europe, and after an\r\nabsence of nearly twenty years from his native land. During this time he\r\nhad become famous as an author, and had been conceded the position of\r\nthe first American gentleman in Europe. He had been received at Courts\r\nas in his official position (Secretary of Legation) and had received the\r\nadmiration of the social and intellectual aristocracy of England.\r\nReturning full of honors, he became at once the lion of New-York, and\r\nwas greeted by a public dinner at the City Hotel. How little could it\r\nhave been imagined, that amid all this harvest of honors, while he stood\r\nthe cynosure of a general admiration, he should still be under the power\r\nof a youthful attachment, and that outliving all the glories of his\r\nsplendid success, a maiden, dead thirty years, held him with undying\r\npower. While others thought him the happy object of a nation's\r\npopularity, his heart was stealing away from noise and notice to the\r\nhallowed ground where Matilda lay.\r\n\r\n     'Oh! what are thousand living loves To that which can not quit the\r\n     dead?'\r\n\r\nThe biographer observes that 'it is in the light of this event that we\r\nmust interpret portions of 'Rural Funerals,' in the _Sketch-Book_, and\r\n'Saint Mark's Eve,' in _Bracebridge Hull_.' From the former of these, we\r\ntherefore make an extract, which is now so powerfully illustrated by the\r\nexperience of its author:\r\n\r\n     'The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to\r\n     be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal; every other\r\n     affliction to forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep\r\n     open; this affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude. Where\r\n     is the mother that would willingly forget the infant that perished\r\n     like a blossom from her arms, though every recollection is a pang?\r\n     Where is the child that would willingly forget the most tender of\r\n     parents, though to remember be but to lament? Who in the hour of\r\n     agony would forget the friend over whom he mourns? Who, when the\r\n     tomb is closing upon the remains of her he most loved, when he\r\n     feels his heart, as it were, crushed, in the closing of its portal,\r\n     would accept of consolation that must be bought by forgetfulness?\r\n     No; the love that survives the tomb is one of the noblest\r\n     attributes of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its\r\n     delights; and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into\r\n     the gentle tear of recollection; when the sudden anguish and the\r\n     convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved\r\n     is softened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the\r\n     days of its loveliness, who would root out such a sorrow from the\r\n     heart? Though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the\r\n     bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of\r\n     gloom, yet who would exchange it even for the song of pleasure or\r\n     the burst of revelry? No; there is a voice from the tomb sweeter\r\n     than song; there is a remembrance of the dead to which we turn even\r\n     from the charms of the living.... But the grave of those we love,\r\n     what a place for meditation! There it is that we call up in long\r\n     review the whole history of virtue and goodness, and the thousand\r\n     endearments lavished upon us almost unheeded in the daily\r\n     intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell upon the\r\n     tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the dying scene. The\r\n     bed of death, with all its stifled griefs, its noiseless\r\n     attendance, its mute, watchful assiduities. The last testimonies of\r\n     expiring love! The feeble, fluttering, thrilling--oh! how\r\n     thrilling--pressure of the hand! The last fond look of the glazing\r\n     eye turned upon us even from the threshold of existence! The\r\n     faint, faltering accents struggling in death to give one more\r\n     assurance of affection!'\r\n\r\nHow truly is this passage 'to be interpreted in the light of the event\r\nin Irving's history', when it is evident from a comparison of it with\r\nthe memoranda, that it is a sketch of that scene which wrecked his\r\nbrightest hopes, and that here he is renewing in this unequaled\r\ndescription of a dying-bed, the last hours of Matilda Hoffman. The\r\nhighly-wrought picture presents a complete detail to the eye, and yet\r\nstill more powerful is that simple utterance in the memoranda: '_I was\r\nthe last one she looked upon_.'\r\n\r\n_St. Mark's Eve_,' to which reference is also made, was written several\r\nyears subsequently, and as may be gathered from its tone, under\r\ncircumstances of peculiar loneliness. It was while a solitary occupant\r\nof his lodgings, a stranger in a foreign city, that he felt the\r\ninspiration of precious memories, and improved his lonely hours by this\r\nexquisite production. 'I am alone,' he writes, 'in my chamber; but these\r\nthemes have taken such hold upon me that I can not sleep. The room in\r\nwhich I sit is just fitted to foster such a state of mind. The walls are\r\nhung with tapestry, the figures of which are faded and look like\r\nunsubstantial shapes melting away from sight.... The murmur of voices and\r\nthe peal of remote laughter no longer reach the ear. The clock from the\r\nchurch, in which so many of the former inhabitants of this house lie\r\nburied, has chimed the awful hour of midnight.' It was a fitting time to\r\nyield to the power of that undying affection which abode with him under\r\nall changes, and the serene presence of one snatched from him years ago\r\nmust at such times have invested him as with a spell. Thus he writes:\r\n\r\n     'Even the doctrines of departed spirits returning to visit the\r\n     scenes and beings which were dear to them during the body's\r\n     existence, though it has been debased by the absurd superstitions\r\n     of the vulgar, in itself is awfully solemn and sublime.... Raise it\r\n     above the frivolous purposes to which it has been applied; strip it\r\n     of the gloom and horror with which it has been surrounded; and\r\n     there is none of the whole circle of visionary creeds that could\r\n     more delightfully elevate the imagination or more tenderly affect\r\n     the heart.... What could be more consoling than the idea that the\r\n     souls of those we once loved were permitted to return and watch\r\n     over our welfare?--that affectionate and guardian spirits sat by\r\n     our pillows while we slept, keeping a vigil over our most helpless\r\n     hours?--that beauty and innocence which had languished in the tomb\r\n     yet smiled unseen around us, revealing themselves in those blest\r\n     dreams wherein they live over again the hours of past\r\n     endearments?.... There are departed beings that I have loved as I\r\n     never shall love again in this world--that have loved me as I never\r\n     again shall be loved. If such beings do ever retain in their\r\n     blessed spheres the attachments they felt on earth; if they take an\r\n     interest in the poor concerns of transient mortality, and are\r\n     permitted to hold communion with those they have loved on earth, I\r\n     feel as if now, at this deep hour of night, in this silence and\r\n     solitude, I could receive their visitation with the most solemn but\r\n     unalloyed delight.'\r\n\r\nThe use of the plural in the above extract obviated that publicity of\r\nhis especial bereavement which would have arisen from a reference to\r\n_one_, and it is to be explained by the deaths of three persons to whom\r\nhe sustained the most endearing though varied relations of which man is\r\ncapable: his mother, his sister Nancy, and his betrothed. The first two\r\nhad become sacred memories, and were enshrined in the sanctuary of his\r\nsoul; but the latter was a thing of life, whose existence had become\r\nidentified with his own, and was made sure beyond the power of disease\r\nand mortality. Who, indeed, would have been so welcome to the solitary\r\ntourist on that weird midnight as she whose Bible and Prayer-Book\r\naccompanied his wanderings, whose miniature was his treasure, and of\r\nwhom he could say: 'She died in the beauty of her youth, and in my\r\nmemory she will ever be young and beautiful.'\r\n\r\nThat a reünion with all the beloved of earth was a controlling thought\r\nin his mind, and one bearing an especial reference to this supreme\r\nbereavement, is manifest from the following, from the same sketch:\r\n\r\n     'We take each other by the hand, and we exchange a few words and\r\n     looks of kindness, and we rejoice together for a few moments, and\r\n     then days, months, years intervene, and we see and know nothing of\r\n     each other. Or granting that we dwell together for the full season\r\n     of this mortal life, the grave soon closes its gates between us,\r\n     and then our spirits are doomed to remain in separation and\r\n     _widowhood_ until they meet again in that more perfect state of\r\n     being, where soul will dwell with soul in blissful communion, and\r\n     there will be neither death, nor absence, nor any thing else to\r\n     interrupt our felicity.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the view which cheered the life of one thus early stripped of\r\npromised and expected happiness, and to which he dung during all changes\r\nof time and place. Amid the infirmities of advancing years, while\r\nsurrounded by an endearing circle of relatives, who ministered to him\r\nwith the most watchful affection, there was one that abode in still\r\ncloser communion with his heart. While writing in his study at\r\nSunnyside, or pacing, in quiet solitude, the streets of New-York, at all\r\ntimes, a fair young form hovered over him and beckoned him heavenward.\r\nYears passed on, until a half-century had been told. All things had\r\nchanged, the scenes and characters of early life had passed away. The\r\nlover had become a kindly old man. The young essayist had become a great\r\nauthor and an heir of fame. The story of life was complete. The hour of\r\nhis departure was at hand, when suddenly the same hand which had\r\nseparated the lovers reünited them forever. Who shall say that the last\r\nimage which flitted across his mind at the awful moment of dissolution,\r\nwas not that fresh and lovely form which he had cherished in unchanging\r\naffection for fifty years?\r\n\r\nI have stated my opinion that it was Irving's disappointment which made\r\nhim the great American author, and to this opinion I now return with\r\nincreased confidence. Had the plans of his youth been carried out; had\r\nhe become a partner of Mr. Hoffman, and had the hands of the lovers been\r\nunited, the whole tenor of his life would have been changed. He would\r\nhave published some fine things, in addition to the Knickerbocker\r\nhistory, and would have ranked high as a gentleman of elegant humor; but\r\nwhere would have been his enduring works? We sympathize with the\r\ndisappointed lover; but we feel thankful that from his sorrow we gather\r\nsuch precious fruit. The death of Matilda led him abroad--to Spain,\r\nwhere he compiled his _Columbus_ and gathered material for his\r\n_Alhambra_--and to England, where the _Columbus_ was finished and\r\npublished, and where his name became great, in spite of national\r\nprejudice. Beside this, the sorrow which cast its sacred shadow upon him\r\ngave his writings that endearing charm which fascinates the emotional\r\nnature and enabled him to touch the hidden chords of the heart.\r\n\r\nIf Ogilvie could congratulate him on the bankruptcy which drove him from\r\nthe details of trade to the richer fruition of literary promise, we may\r\nconsider it a beneficent working of Providence, which afforded to Irving\r\na still earlier emancipation from the law, cheered as it might have been\r\nby the kindness of Mr. Hoffman and the society of Matilda.\r\n\r\nSuch being the remarkable chain which unites the names of the author and\r\nhis love, we can not but consider her as a part of his character through\r\nthe best years of his life and amid all the splendid success of his\r\nliterary career. Indeed, through coming generations of readers, the\r\nnames of Irving and Matilda will be united in the loveliest and most\r\nromantic of associations.\r\n\r\nI have prolonged this reminiscence to an unexpected length, and yet can\r\nnot close without a few additional thoughts which grow out of the\r\nperusal of the biography. Perhaps the chief of these is the nationality\r\nof Irving's character, particularly while a resident of Europe. Neither\r\nthe pungent bitterness of the British press nor the patronage of the\r\naristocracy could abate the firmness with which he upheld the dignity of\r\nhis country. He was not less her representative when a struggling author\r\nin Liverpool or London than when Secretary of Legation at the Court of\r\nSt. James, or Ambassador at Madrid. His first appearance abroad was at a\r\ntime of little foreign travel, and an American was an object of remark\r\nand observation. His elegant simplicity reflected honor upon his native\r\nland, and amid all classes, and in all places, love of country ruled\r\nhim. This high tone pervaded his views of public duty. A gross defaulter\r\nhaving been mentioned in his presence, he replied, that 'next to robbing\r\none's father it is, to rob one's country.'\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of note that while Irving lived to unusual fullness of\r\nyears, yet he never was considered an old man. We do not so much refer\r\nto his erect and vigorous frame as to the freshness of his mind. It is\r\nsaid that Goethe, on being asked the definition of a poet, replied: 'One\r\nwho preserves to old age the feelings of youth.' Such was a leading\r\nfeature in Mr. Irving's spirit, which, notwithstanding his shadowed\r\nhours, was so buoyant and cheerful. His countenance was penseroso when\r\nin repose, and allegro in action, and these graces clung to him even in\r\nlife's winter, like the flower at the base of the glacier.\r\n\r\nAmong the varied elements which constituted Irving's popularity, one of\r\nthem might have been the beauty of his name, whose secret is revealed by\r\nthe laws of prosody. Washington is a stately _dactyl_; Irving is a sweet\r\nand mellow _spondee_, and thus we have a combination which poets in\r\nancient and modern days have sought with sedulous care, and which should\r\nclose every line of hexameter verse. Hence a measure such, as that found\r\nin 'Washington Irving' terminates every line in _Evangeline_, or the\r\nworks of Virgil, thus:\r\n\r\n    'Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline _went from the mission_,\r\n    When, over green ways, by long and _perilous marches_,\r\n    She had attained at length the depth of the _Michigan forest_.'\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    'Supplicia hausorem ecopulis: et _nomine Dido_,\r\n    Et recidiva manu posuissem _Pergama vetis_.'\r\n\r\nIt will be readily perceived that the name of the American author can be\r\nsubstituted for the feet italicized above, without injuring the measure,\r\nwhile in some of Moore's finest stansas beautifully alternates the same\r\nverse, thus:\r\n\r\n    'Oh! fair as the sea-flower, _close to thee growing_,\r\n      How light was thy heart till love's witchery came!\r\n    Like the wind of the South, o'er a _summer lute blowing_,\r\n      And hushed all its music, and withered its flame.'\r\n\r\nAt the close of his last great work, Mr. Irving sought for rest. He laid\r\naside his pen, even from correspondence, and felt that his work was\r\ndone. When in New-York, he was often to be found at the Astor Library,\r\nof which he was a trustee; but his visits to the city became few, and he\r\nseemed to realize that his time was come. To one who kindly remarked, 'I\r\nhope you will soon be better,' He calmly replied, in an earnest tone: 'I\r\nshall never be better.' The words came true too soon, and amid an\r\nunequaled pomp of unaffected sorrow, they bore him to a place of rest,\r\nby the side of his parents and all of his kin who had gone before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BYRONIC MISANTHROPY._\r\n\r\n  He has a grief he can not speak;\r\n    He wears his hat awry;\r\n  He blacks his boots but once a week;\r\n    And says he wants to die!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW-ENGLAND'S ADVANCE._\r\n\r\n  Hurrah! for our New-England,\r\n    When she rose up firm and grand,\r\n  In her calm, terrific beauty,\r\n    With the stout sword in her hand;\r\n  When she raised her arm undaunted,\r\n    In the sacred cause of Right,\r\n  Like a crowned queen of valor,\r\n    Strong in her faith and might.\r\n\r\n  Hurrah! for our New-England!\r\n    When the war-cry shook the breeze,\r\n  She wore the garb of glory,\r\n    And quaffed the cup of ease;\r\n  But I saw a look of daring\r\n    On her proud features rise,\r\n  And the fire of will was flashing\r\n    Through the calm light of her eyes.\r\n\r\n  From her brow serene, majestic,\r\n    The wreath of peace she took,\r\n  And war's red rose sprang blooming,\r\n    And its bloody petals shook\r\n  On her heaving, beating bosom;\r\n    And with forehead crowned with light,\r\n  Transfigured, she presented\r\n    Her proud form to the fight.\r\n\r\n  Hurrah! for our New-England!\r\n    What lightning courage ran\r\n  Through her brave heart, as she bounded\r\n    To the battle's fearful van;\r\n  O'er her head the starry banner;\r\n    While her loud, inspiring cry,\r\n  'Death or Freedom for our Nation,'\r\n    Rang against the clouded sky.\r\n\r\n  I saw our own New-England\r\n    Dealing blows for Truth and Right,\r\n  And the grandeur of her purpose\r\n    Gave her eyes a sacred light;\r\n  Ah! name her 'the Invincible,'\r\n    Through rebel rank and host;\r\n  For Justice evermore is done,\r\n    And Right comes uppermost.\r\n\r\n  Hurrah for our New-England!\r\n    Through the battle's fearful brunt,\r\n  Through the red sea of the carnage,\r\n    Still she struggles in the front;\r\n\r\n  And victory's war-eagle,\r\n    Hovering o'er the fiery blast,\r\n  On her floating, starry standard.\r\n    Is settling down at last.\r\n\r\n  There is glory for New-England,\r\n    When Oppression's strife is done,\r\n  When the tools of Wrong are vanquished,\r\n    And the cause of Freedom won;\r\n  She shall sit in garments spotless,\r\n    And shall breathe the odorous balm\r\n  Of the cool green of contentment,\r\n    In the bowers of peace and calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?_\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to many it is _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.--_Goethe_.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe little village of Burnsville, in Connecticut, was thrown into a\r\nstate of excitement by the report that Hiram Meeker was about to remove\r\nto the city of New-York. Two or three elderly maiden ladies with whom\r\nHiram was an especial favorite, declared there was not a word of truth\r\nin the ridiculous rumor. The girls of the village very generally\r\ndiscredited it. The young men said Hiram was not such a fool; he knew on\r\nwhich side his bread was buttered; he knew when to let well enough\r\nalone, and so forth. Still the report was circulated. To be sure, nobody\r\nbelieved it, yet it spread all the faster for being contradicted. I have\r\nsaid that the young ladies of Burnsville put no faith in the story.\r\nPossibly Sarah Burns was an exception, and Sarah, it was well\r\nunderstood, was an interested party, and would be apt to know the truth.\r\nShe did not contradict the statement when made in her presence, and\r\nonce, when appealed to for her opinion, she looked very serious, and\r\nsaid it might be so for all she knew. At length there were two parties\r\nformed in Burnsville. One on whose banner was inscribed: 'Hiram Meeker\r\nis going to New-York.' The other with flag bearing in large letters: 'No\r\nsuch thing: Hiram is not going.'\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy, one would suppose, to settle the important\r\ncontroversy by a direct appeal to Hiram Meeker himself. Strange to say,\r\nthis does not appear to have been done, both sides fearing, like\r\nexperienced generals, to risk the result on a single issue. But numerous\r\nwere the hints and innuendoes conveyed to him, to which he always gave\r\nsatisfactory replies--satisfactory to both parties--both contending he\r\nhad, by his answers, confirmed their own particular view of the case.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not last forever. It was brought suddenly to\r\nan end one Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker was a member, in regular standing, of the Congregational\r\nChurch in Burnsville. The Preparatory Lecture, as it is called, that is,\r\nthe lecture delivered prior to 'Communion-Sabbath,' in the church, was\r\nalways on the previous Friday, at three o'clock P.M. On a pleasant day\r\ntoward the end of April, Hiram Meeker and Sarah Burns went in company\r\nto attend this lecture. The exercises were especially interesting.\r\nSeveral young people, at the close of the services, who had previously\r\nbeen propounded, were examined as to their 'experience,' and a vote was\r\nseparately taken on the admission of each. This over, the clergyman\r\nspoke as follows: 'Brother Hiram Meeker being about to remove from among\r\nus, desires to dissolve his connection with the Congregational church in\r\nBurnsville, and requests the usual certificate of membership and good\r\nstanding. Is it your pleasure that he receive it? Those in favor will\r\nplease to signify it.' Several 'right hands' were held up, and the\r\nmatter was concluded. A young man who sat nearly opposite Sarah Burns,\r\nobserved that on the announcement, her face became very pale.\r\n\r\nWhen the little company of church-members was dismissed, Hiram Meeker\r\nand Sarah Burns walked away together as they came. No, not _as_ they\r\ncame, as the following conversation will show.\r\n\r\n'Why did you not tell me, Hiram?'\r\n\r\n'Because, Sarah, I did not fully decide till the mail came in this very\r\nafternoon. I had only time to speak to Mr. Chase, and there was no\r\nopportunity to see you, and I could not tell you about it while we were\r\nwalking along so happy together.'\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker lied.\r\n\r\nSarah Burns could not disbelieve him; it was not possible Hiram would\r\ndeceive her, but her heart _felt_ the lie, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker is the hero of this history. It is, therefore, necessary to\r\ngive some account of him previous to his introduction to the reader on\r\nthe afternoon of the preparatory lecture. At the date of the\r\ncommencement of the narrative, he was already twenty-two years old. He\r\nwas the youngest of several children. His father was a highly\r\nrespectable man, who resided in Hampton, about fifteen miles from\r\nBurnsville, and cultivated one of the most valuable farms in the county.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Meeker both had the reputation of being excellent people.\r\nThey were exemplary members of the church, and brought up their children\r\nwith a great deal of care. They were in every respect dissimilar. He was\r\ntall, thin, and dark-complexioned; she was almost short, very fair, and\r\nportly in appearance. Mr. Meeker was a kind-hearted, generous,\r\nunambitious man, who loved his home and his children, and rejoiced when\r\nhe could see every body happy around him. He was neither close nor\r\ncalculating. With a full share of natural ability, he did not turn his\r\ntalents to accumulation, quite content if he made the ends of the year\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker was a woman who never took a step from impulse. She had a\r\nmotive for every act of her life. Exceedingly acute in her judgments of\r\npeople, she brought her shrewdness to bear on all occasions. She was a\r\ncapital housekeeper, a most excellent manager, a pattern wife and\r\nmother. I say, 'pattern wife and mother,' for she was devoted to her\r\nhusband's interests, which, to be sure, were equally her own; she made\r\nevery thing very comfortable for him indoors, and she managed\r\nexpenditures with an economy and closeness which Mr. Meeker was quite\r\nincapable of. She looked after her children with unremitting care. They\r\nwere sent to better schools, and their associations were of a better\r\ndescription than those of her neighbors. She took personal pains with\r\ntheir religious culture. Although they were sent to Sunday-school, she\r\nherself taught them the Catechism, the Commandments, the Lord's Prayer,\r\nand the Sermon on the Mount, beside a great variety of Gospel hymns and\r\nBible-stories. But along with these excellent teachings they were\r\ntaught--what is apt to be taught in almost every family, to almost every\r\nchild--to regard appearances, to make the best possible show to the\r\nworld, to _seem_ what they ought to _be_; apparently a sort of short-cut\r\nto goodness, but really a turnpike erected by the devil, which leads any\r\nwhere rather than to the desired point. Mrs. Meeker was a religious\r\nwoman, scrupulous and exact in every outward observance; in this\r\nrespect severe with herself and with all around her. Yet this never\r\nprevented her having an eye to the 'main chance,' which was, to get on\r\nin the world. Indeed, to attempt to do so, was with her a fundamental\r\nduty. She loved to pray the Lord to bless 'our basket and our store.'\r\nShe dwelt much on the promise of 'a hundred-fold' in this world in\r\naddition to the 'inheritance of everlasting life.' She could repeat all\r\nthe practical maxims which abound in the book of Proverbs, and she was\r\ncareful, when she feared her husband was about to give way to a generous\r\nimpulse in favor of a poor relation or neighbor, to put him in mind of\r\nhis own large and increasing household, solemnly cautioning him that he\r\nwho looked not well after it, was 'worse than an infidel.' In short,\r\nbeing fully convinced by application of her natural shrewd sense that\r\nreligion was the safest thing for her here and hereafter, she became\r\nreligious. In her piety there was manifested but one idea--self.\r\nWhatever she did, was from a sense of duty, and she did her duty because\r\nit was the way to prosperity and heaven.\r\n\r\nI have remarked how different were husband and wife. They lived\r\ntogether, however, without discord, for Mr. Meeker yielded most points\r\nof controversy when they arose, and for the rest his wife was neither\r\ndisagreeable nor unamiable. But the poor woman had experienced through\r\nlife one great drawback; she had half-a-dozen fine children. Alas! not\r\none of them resembled her in temper, character, or disposition. All\r\npossessed their father's happy traits, which were developed more and\r\nmore as they grew older, despite their mother's incessant warnings and\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nFrank, the first-born, exhibited fondness for books, and early\r\nmanifested an earnest desire for a liberal education with a view to the\r\nstudy of medicine. His father resolved to gratify him. His mother was\r\nopposed to it. She wanted her boy a merchant. 'Doctors,' she said, 'were\r\nmostly a poor set, who were obliged to work very hard by day and by\r\nnight, and got little for it. If Frank would only be contented to go\r\ninto her cousin's store, in New-York, (he was one of the prominent\r\nwholesale dry-goods jobbers,) why, there would be some hope of him, that\r\nis, if he could cure himself of certain extravagant notions; but to go\r\nthrough college, and then study medicine! Why couldn't he, at least, be\r\na lawyer, then there might be a chance for him.'\r\n\r\n'But the boy has no taste for mercantile life, nor for the law,' said\r\nMr. Meeker.\r\n\r\n'Taste--fiddlesticks,' responded his wife, 'as if a boy has a right to\r\nhave any taste contrary to his parents' wish.'.\r\n\r\n'But, Jane, it is not contrary to _my_ wish.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker looked her husband steadily in the face. She saw there an\r\nunusual expression of firmness; something which she knew it to be idle\r\nto contend with, and with her usual good sense, she withdrew from the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\n'Have it your own way, Mr. Meeker. You know my opinion. It was my duty\r\nto express it. Make of Frank what you like. I pray that he may be\r\nprospered in whatever he undertakes.'\r\n\r\nSo Frank was sent to college, with the understanding that, after\r\ngraduating, he was to pursue his favorite study of medicine.\r\n\r\nA few months after he entered, Mrs. Meeker gave birth to her seventh\r\nchild--the subject of the present narrative. Her disappointment at\r\nFrank's destination was severe. Besides, she met with daily evidences\r\nthat pained her. None of her children were, to use her expression,\r\n'after her own heart.' There were two other boys, George and William,\r\nwho she was accustomed to say, almost bitterly, were 'clear father.' The\r\nthree girls, Jane, Laura, and Mary, one would suppose might represent\r\nthe mother's side; but alas! they were 'clear father' too.\r\n\r\nIn her great distress, as Mrs. Meeker often afterward declared, she\r\nresolved to 'call upon the Lord.' She prayed that the child she was\r\nsoon to give birth to might be a boy, and become a joy and consolation\r\nto his mother. She read over solicitously all the passages, of Scripture\r\nshe could find, which she thought might be applicable to her case. As\r\nthe event approached, she exhibited still greater faith and enthusiasm.\r\nShe declared she had consecrated her child to God, and felt a holy\r\nconfidence that the offering was accepted. Do not suppose from this, she\r\nintended to devote him to the ministry. _That_ required a special call,\r\nand it did not appear such a call had been revealed to her. But she\r\nprayed earnestly that he might be chosen and favored of the Most High;\r\nthat he might stand before kings; that he might not be slothful in\r\nbusiness; but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. The happy frame of\r\nmind Mrs. Meeker had attained, at length became the subject of\r\nconversation in the neighborhood. The clergyman was greatly interested.\r\nHe even made allusion to it in the weekly prayer-meeting, which, by the\r\nby, rather scandalized some of the unmarried ladies present.\r\n\r\nMr. Meeker took all this in good part. The truth is, he regarded it as a\r\nvery innocent whim, which required to be indulged in his wife's delicate\r\nsituation; so he always joined in her hopeful anticipations, and\r\nendeavored to sympathize with them. It was under these auspicious\r\ncircumstances that Hiram Meeker first saw the light. All his mother's\r\nprayers seemed to have been answered. The boy, from the earliest\r\nmanifestation of intelligence, exhibited traits which could belong only\r\nto her. As he advanced into childhood, these became more and more\r\napparent. He had none of the openness of disposition which was possessed\r\nby the other children. He gave much less trouble about the house than\r\nthey ever did, and was more easily managed than they had been at his\r\nage. It must not be inferred that because he was his mother's favorite,\r\nhe received any special indulgence, or was not subject to every proper\r\ndiscipline. Indeed, the discipline was more severe, the moral teachings\r\nmore unremitting, the practical lessons more frequent than with any of\r\nthe rest. But there could not exist a more tractable child than Hiram.\r\nHe was apparently made for special training, he took to it so readily,\r\nas if appreciating results and anxious to arrive at them. When he was\r\nsix years old, it was astonishing what a number of Bible-verses and\r\nSunday-school hymns he had committed to memory, and how much the child\r\n_knew_. He was especially familiar with the uses of money. He knew the\r\nvalue of a dollar, and what could be purchased with it. So of half a\r\ndollar, a quarter, ten cents, and five cents. He had already established\r\nfor himself a little savings bank, in which were placed the small sums\r\nwhich were occasionally presented to him. He could tell the cost of each\r\nof his playthings respectively, and, indeed, of every article about the\r\nhouse; he learned the price of tea, sugar, coffee, and molasses. This\r\ninformation, to be sure, formed a part of his mother's course of\r\ninstruction; but it was strange how he took to it. Systematically and\r\nunceasingly, she pursued it. Oh! how she rejoiced in her youngest child.\r\nHow she thanked God for answering her prayers. I had forgotten to state\r\nthat there was considerable difficulty in deciding what name to give the\r\nboy. Mrs. Meeker had an uncle, a worthy minister, by the name of\r\nNathaniel. Mr. Meeker suggested that the new-comer be called after him.\r\nHis wife did not like to object; but she thought Nathaniel a very\r\ndisagreeable name. Her cousin, the rich dry-goods merchant in New-York,\r\nwho had four daughters and no sons, was named Hiram. Hiram was a good\r\nname, not too long and very expressive. It sounded firm and strong. It\r\nwas a Bible-name, too, as well as the other. In fact, she liked it, and\r\nshe thought her cousin would be gratified when he learned that she had\r\nnamed a child for him. There were advantages which might flow from it,\r\nit was not necessary to specify, Mr. Meeker could understand to what\r\nshe alluded Mr. Meeker did not understand; in fact, he did not trouble\r\nhis head to conjecture; but it was settled Hiram should be the name, and\r\nour hero was baptized accordingly. He was a good boy; never in mischief,\r\nnever a truant, never disobedient, nor willful, nor irritable, nor\r\nobstinate. 'Too good for this world;' that is what folks said. 'Such an\r\nastonishing child--too wise to live long.' So it was prophesied; but\r\nHiram survived all these dismal forebodings, until the people gave up\r\nand concluded to let him live.\r\n\r\nWe pass over his earlier days at school. At twelve, he was sent to the\r\nacademy in the village, about a mile distant. He was to receive a\r\nfirst-rate English education, 'no Latin, no Greek, no nonsense,' to use\r\nhis mother's language; but the real substantials. Hiram proved to be an\r\nexcellent scholar. He was especially good in figures. When he came to\r\nstudy bookkeeping, he seemed as happy as if he were reading a romance.\r\nHe mastered with ease the science of single and double entry. He soon\r\nbecame fascinated with the beauties of his imaginary business. For his\r\ninstructor had prepared for him a regular set of books, and gave him\r\nproblems, from day to day, in mercantile dealings, which opened up to\r\nthe youth all the mysteries of 'Dr.' and 'Cr.' Out of these various\r\nproblems, he constructed quite a little library of account-books, which\r\nhe numbered, and which were representations of various descriptions of\r\ntrade, and marked with the name of some supposed company, and labeled\r\n'Business Successful,' or 'Business Unsuccessful,' as the case might be.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn from Hiram, engaged in diligently pursuing his studies,\r\nand enter on another topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker had been a church-member from the time she was fourteen\r\nyears old. There was an extensive revival throughout the country at that\r\nperiod, and she, with a large number of young people of both sexes,\r\nwere, or thought they were, converted. She used to speak of this\r\ncircumstance very often to her children, especially when any one of them\r\napproached the age which witnessed, to use her own language, 'her\r\nresignation of the pomps and vanities of life, and her dedication to the\r\nservice of her Saviour.' Still, notwithstanding her prayers and\r\npainstaking, not one of them had ever been under 'conviction of sin;' at\r\nleast, none had ever manifested that agony and mental suffering which\r\nshe considered necessary to a genuine change of heart. She mourned much\r\nover such a state of things in her household. What a scandal that not\r\none of _her_ children should give any evidences of saving grace! What a\r\nsubject for reproach in the mouths of the ungodly! But it was not her\r\nfault; no, she often felt that Mr. Meeker was too lax in discipline,\r\n(she had had fears of _him_, sometimes, lest he might become a\r\ncastaway,) and did not set that Christian example, at all times, which\r\nshe could desire. For instance, after church on Sunday afternoon, it was\r\nhis custom, when the season was favorable, frequently with a child\r\nholding each hand, to walk leisurely over his fields, humming a cheerful\r\nhymn and taking note of whatever was pleasant in the scene, perhaps the\r\nfresh vegetation just bursting into life, or the opening flowers, or it\r\nmight be the maturing fruit, or the ripening yellow grain. On these\r\noccasions, he would endeavor to impress on his children how good God\r\nwas; how seed-time and harvest always came; how the sun shone on the\r\nevil as well as on the good, and the rain descended both on the just and\r\non the unjust. He, too, would inculcate lessons of diligence and\r\nindustry, agreeable lessons, after quite a different model from those of\r\nhis wife. He would repeat, for example, not in an austere fashion, but\r\nin a way which interested and even amused them, the dramatic description\r\nof the sluggard, from the hook of Proverbs, commencing:\r\n\r\n_'I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man,\r\nvoid of understanding;\r\n\r\n'And lo! it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the\r\nface thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.'_\r\n\r\nIt is a memorable fact that Hiram was never in the habit of accompanying\r\nhis father on these Sunday-excursions. Not that his mother positively\r\ninterdicted him. She was too judicious a person to hold up to censure\r\nany habitual act of her husband, whatever might have been her own\r\nopinion, or however she might have remonstrated with him in private. She\r\nhad no difficulty in keeping Hiram by her side on Sunday afternoons, and\r\nthe little fellow seemed instinctively to appreciate why. Indeed, I\r\ndoubt if the green fields and pleasant meadow, with the pretty brook\r\nrunning through it, had any charms for him even then. At any rate, he\r\nwas satisfied with his mother's reason, that it was not good for him; he\r\nhad better stay at home with her.\r\n\r\nAt fourteen, Hiram was to become 'pious.' So Mrs. Meeker fervently\r\nhoped, and to this end her prayers were specially directed. Her son once\r\nsecure and safe within the pale of the church, she could be free to\r\nprosecute for him her earthly plans, which could not be sanctioned or\r\nblessed of Heaven, so long as he was still in the gall of sin and bonds\r\nof iniquity. So she labored to explain to him how impossible it was for\r\nan unconverted person to think an acceptable thought or do a single\r\nacceptable act in the sight of God. All his labor was sin, while he was\r\nin a state of sin, whether it was at the plow, or in the shop, or store,\r\nor office, or counting-room. She warned him of the wrath to come, and\r\nshe explained to him with minute vividness the everlasting despair and\r\ntortures of the damned. Hiram was a good deal affected. He began to feel\r\nthat his position personally was perilous. He wanted to get out of it,\r\nespecially as his mother assured him if he should be taken away--and he\r\nwas liable to die that very night--then alas! his soul would lie down in\r\neverlasting burnings. At last, the youth was thoroughly alarmed. His\r\nmother recollected she had continued just one week under conviction,\r\nbefore light dawned in on her, and she considered that a proper period\r\nfor her son to go through. She contented herself, at first, by\r\ncautioning him against a relapse into his old condition, for then seven\r\nother spirits more wicked than the first would have possession of him,\r\nand his last state would be worse than the first. Besides, he would run\r\ngreat risk of sinning away his day of grace. It was soon understood in\r\nthe church that Hiram was under concern of mind. Mrs. Meeker, on the\r\nfourth day, withdrew him from school, and sent for the minister to pray\r\nwith him. He found him in great distress, I might say in great bodily\r\nterror; for he was very much afraid when he got into bed at night, he\r\nmight awake in hell the next morning. The clergyman was a worthy and a\r\nsincere man. He was anxious that a true repentance should flow from\r\nHiram's present distress, and the lively agony of the child awakened his\r\nstrongest sympathy. He talked very kindly to him, explained in a\r\ngenuine, truthful manner, what was necessary. He dwelt on the mercy of\r\nour heavenly Father, and on his love. He prayed with the lad earnestly,\r\nand with many affectionate counsels he went away. Hiram was comforted.\r\nThings began to look in a pleasanter light than ever before. He had only\r\nto repent and believe, and it was his duty to repent and believe, and\r\nall would be well. So it happened that when the week was out, Hiram felt\r\nthat he had cast his burden on the Lord, and was accepted by him.\r\n\r\nThere were great rejoicings over this event. Mrs. Meeker exclaimed,\r\nwhile tears streamed from her eyes, that she was ready to depart in\r\npeace. Mr. Meeker, who had by no means been indifferent to his son's\r\nstate of mind, and who had sought from time to time to encourage him,\r\n(rather, it must be confessed, to his wife's annoyance,) was thankful\r\nthat he had obtained relief from the right source. The happy subject\r\nhimself became an object of a good deal of interest in the congregation.\r\nThere was not the usual attention, just then, to religious matters, and\r\nHiram's conversion was seized on as a token that more fruits were to be\r\ngathered in from the same field, that is, among the young. In due course\r\nhe was propounded and admitted into the church. It happened on that day\r\nthat he was the only individual who joined, and he was the observed of\r\nall observers. Hiram Meeker was a handsome boy, well formed, with an\r\ninteresting face, blight blue eyes, and a profusion of light hair\r\nshading a forehead indicative of much intelligence. All this was\r\ndisclosed to the casual observer; indeed, who would stop to criticise\r\nthe features of one so young--else you would have been struck by\r\nsomething disagreeable about the corners of his mouth, something\r\nrepulsive in the curve of those thin lips, (he had his mother's lips,)\r\nsomething forbidding in a certain latent expression of the eye, while\r\nyou would remark with pain the conscious, self-possessed air with which\r\nhe took his place in the broad aisle before the pulpit, to give his\r\nassent to the church articles and confession of faith. The good minister\r\npreached from the text, 'Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy\r\nyouth,' and in the course of his sermon held up Hiram as an example to\r\nall the unconverted youth of his flock. On Monday he returned to school,\r\nprosecuting his studies more diligently than ever. He felt that he had\r\nsecured the true salvation, and was safe now in whatever he undertook.\r\nHe was very careful in the observance of all his religious exercises,\r\nand so far as I can ascertain, never neglected any of them. Thus happily\r\nlaunched, Hiram continued at school till he was nearly seventeen. He\r\nhad, for the last two years, been sent to Newton Institute, one of the\r\nbest institutions in the State, where his advantages would be superior\r\nto those of the academy in his native town. There he learned the higher\r\nbranches of mathematics, and studied with care mercantile and\r\ndescriptive geography with reference to the different products of the\r\nearth. During this time his proficiency was excellent, and his conduct\r\nalways most exemplary.\r\n\r\nAt length his course was completed, and Mrs. Meeker felt that her\r\ncousin, the wholesale dry-goods jobber in New-York, would be proud of\r\nsuch an acquisition in his establishment. He had been duly apprised that\r\nthe boy was named for him, and really appeared to manifest, by his\r\ninquiries, a good deal of interest in Hiram. Although they generally met\r\nonce or twice a year, Mrs. Meeker did not apprise her cousin of her\r\nplans, preferring to wait till her son should have finished his\r\nacademical course before making them known. Her first idea was to send\r\nhim to New-York with a letter, in which she would fully explain her\r\nhopes and wishes. On second thought, she concluded to write first, and\r\nawait her cousin's reply. It will be seen, from the perusal of it, she\r\ntook the proper course.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n                                        '_New-York, May 15th, 18--._\r\n\r\n     'DEAR COUSIN: Your letter of May 12th is before me. I am glad to\r\n     hear you are all well at Hampton. We are much obliged for your kind\r\n     invitation for the summer. I think you may count confidently on a\r\n     visit from my wife and myself some time during the season, and I\r\n     have no doubt one of the girls will come with us. I know _I_ shall\r\n     enjoy it for one, and I am sure we all shall.\r\n\r\n     'As to my namesake, I am glad to hear so good an account of him.\r\n     Now, cousin, I really take an interest in the lad, and beg you will\r\n     not make any wry faces over an honest expression of my opinion. If\r\n     you want the boy to make a first-rate merchant, and SUCCEED, don't\r\n     send him to me at present. Of course, I will receive him, if you\r\n     insist upon it. But, in my opinion, it will only spoil him. I tell\r\n     you frankly, I would not give a fig for a city-bred boy. But I will\r\n     enter into this compact with you: I will undertake to make a\r\n     first-class merchant of Hiram, if you will let me have my own way.\r\n     If you do not, I can not answer for it. What I recommend is, that\r\n     you put him into one of the stores in your own village. If I\r\n     remember right, there are two there which do a regular country\r\n     trade, and have a general stock of dry goods, groceries, crockery,\r\n     clothing, stationery, etc., etc., etc. Here he will learn two\r\n     things--detail and economy--without a practical knowledge of which,\r\n     no man can succeed in mercantile business. I presume you will\r\n     consider this a great falling off from your expectations. Perhaps\r\n     you will think it petty business for your boy to be behind a\r\n     counter in a small country store, selling a shilling's worth of\r\n     calico, a cent's worth of snuff, or taking in a dozen eggs in\r\n     exchange, but there is just where he ought to be, for the present.\r\n     I repeat, he will learn detail. He will understand the value of all\r\n     sorts of merchandise; he will get a real knowledge of barter and\r\n     trade. When he learns out there, put him in another retail store of\r\n     more magnitude. Keep him at this three or four years, and then I\r\n     agree to make a merchant of him. I repeat, don't be disappointed at\r\n     my letter. I tell you candidly, if I had a son, that's just what I\r\n     would do with him, and it is just what I want you to do with Hiram.\r\n     I hope you will write me that you approve of my plan. If you do,\r\n     you may rely on my advice at all times, and I think I have some\r\n     experience in these matters.\r\n\r\n     'We all desire to be remembered to your husband and family.\r\n\r\n                                  'Very truly, your cousin,\r\n\r\n                                           'HIRAM BENNETT.'\r\n\r\nHe had added, from habit, '& Co.,' but this was erased.\r\n\r\nThe letter _was_ a heavy blow to the fond mother; but she recovered from\r\nit quickly, like a sensible woman. In fact, she perceived her cousin was\r\nsincere, and she herself appreciated the good sense of his suggestions.\r\nHer husband, whom she thought best to consult, since matters were taking\r\nthis turn, approved of what her cousin had written, and so it was\r\ndecided that Hiram should become a clerk of Mr. Jessup, the most\r\nenterprising of the two 'store--keepers' in Hampton. How he got along\r\nwith Mr. Jessup, and finally entered the service of Mr. Burns, at\r\nBurnsville, must be reserved for a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MONROE TO FARRAGUT._\r\n\r\n  By brutal force you've seized the town,\r\n  And therefore the flag shall not come down.\r\n  And having told you that it shan't,\r\n  Just let me show you why it can't.\r\n  The climate here is very queer,\r\n  In the matter of flags at this time of year.\r\n  If a Pelican touched the banner prized,\r\n  He would be _immediately_ paralyzed.\r\n  I'm a gentleman born--though now on the shelf,\r\n  And I think you are almost one yourself.\r\n  For from my noble ancestry,\r\n  I can tell the _élite_, by sympathy.\r\n  Had you lived among _us_, sir, now and then,\r\n  No one can say what you might have been.\r\n  So refrain from any sneer or quiz,\r\n  Which may wound our susceptibilities.\r\n  For my people are all refined--like me,\r\n  While yours are all low as low can be.\r\n  As for shooting women or children either,\r\n  Or any such birds of the Union feather,\r\n  We shall in all things consult our ease,\r\n  And act exactly as we please.\r\n  For you've nothing to do with our laws, you know,\r\n  Yours, merely 'respectfully,           JOHN MONROE.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_AMONG THE PINES._\r\n\r\nAlighting from the carriage, I entered, with the Colonel, the cabin of\r\nthe negro-hunter. So far as external appearance went, the shanty was a\r\nslight improvement on the 'Mills House,' described in a previous\r\nchapter; but internally, it was hard to say whether it resembled more a\r\npig-sty or a dog-kennel. The floor was of the bare earth, covered in\r\npatches with loose plank of various descriptions, and littered over with\r\nbillets of 'lightwood,' unwashed cooking utensils, two or three cheap\r\nstools, a pine settee--made from the rough log and hewn smooth on the\r\nupper-side--a full-grown blood-hound, two younger canines, and nine\r\ndirt-encrusted juveniles, of the flax-head species. Over against the\r\nfire-place three low beds afforded sleeping accommodation to nearly a\r\ndozen human beings, (of assorted sizes, and dove-tailed together with\r\nheads and feet alternating,) and in the opposite corner a lower couch,\r\nwhose finer furnishings told plainly it was the peculiar property of the\r\n'wee-ones' of her family--a mother's tenderness for the youngest thus\r\ncropping out even in the midst of filth and degradation--furnished\r\nquarters for an unwashed, uncombed, unclothed, saffron-hued little\r\nfellow about fifteen months old, and--the dog 'Lady.'\r\n\r\nThe dog was of a dark hazel-color--a cross between a setter and a\r\ngray-hound--and one of the most beautiful creatures I ever saw. Her neck\r\nand breast were bound about with a coarse cotton cloth, saturated with\r\nblood, and emitting a strong odor of bad whisky; and her whole\r\nappearance showed the desperate nature of the encounter with the\r\noverseer.\r\n\r\nThe nine young democrats who were lolling about the room in various\r\nattitudes rose as we entered, and with a familiar but rather deferential\r\n'Howdy'ge,' to the Colonel, huddled around and stared at me with open\r\nmouths and distended eyes, as if I were a strange being dropped from\r\nsome other sphere. The two eldest were of the male gender, as was shown\r\nby their clothes--cast-off suits of the inevitable reddish-gray--much\r\ntoo large, and out at the elbows and the knees; but the sex of the\r\nothers I was at a loss to determine, for they wore only a single robe,\r\nreaching, like their mother's, from the neck to the knees. Not one of\r\nthe occupants of the cabin boasted a pair of stockings, but the father\r\nand mother did enjoy the luxury of shoes--coarse, stout brogans,\r\nuntanned, and of the color of the legs which they encased.\r\n\r\n'Well, Sandy, how is Lady?' asked the Colonel, as he stepped to the bed\r\nof the wounded dog.\r\n\r\n'Reckon she's a goner, Cunnel; the d----d Yankee orter swing fur it.'\r\n\r\nThis intimation that the overseer was a 'countryman' of mine, took me by\r\nsurprise, nothing I had observed in his speech or manners having\r\nindicated it, but I consoled myself with the reflection that Connecticut\r\nhad reared him--as she makes wooden hams and nutmegs--expressly for the\r\nSouthern market.'\r\n\r\n'He _shall_ swing for it, by ----. But are you sure the dog will die?'\r\n\r\n'Not shore, Cunnel, but she can't stand, and the blood _will_ run. I\r\nreckon a hun'red and fifty ar done for thar, sartin.'\r\n\r\n'D---- the money--I'll make that right. Go to the house and get some\r\nointment from Madam--she can save her--go at once,' said my host.\r\n\r\n'I will, Cunnel,' replied the dirt-eater, taking his broad-brim from the\r\nwooden peg where it was reposing, and leisurely leaving the cabin.\r\nMaking our way over the piles of rubbish and crowds of children that\r\ncumbered the apartment, the Colonel and I then returned to the carriage.\r\n\r\n'Dogs must be rare in this region,' I remarked, as we resumed our\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n'Yes, well-trained bloodhounds are scarce every where. That dog is well\r\nworth a hundred and fifty dollars.'\r\n\r\n'The business of nigger-catching, then, is brisk, just now?'\r\n\r\n'No, not more brisk than usual. We always have more or less runaways.'\r\n\r\n'Do most of them take to the swamps?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, nine out of ten do, though now and then one gets off on a\r\ntrading-vessel. It is almost impossible for a strange nigger to make his\r\nway by land from here to the free States.'\r\n\r\n'Then why do you Carolinians make such an outcry about the violation of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law?'\r\n\r\n'For the same reason that dogs quarrel over a naked bone. We should be\r\nunhappy if we couldn't growl at the Yankees,' replied the Colonel,\r\nlaughing heartily.\r\n\r\n'_We_, you say; you mean by that, the hundred and eighty thousand nabobs\r\nwho own five sixths of your slaves?'[4]\r\n\r\n     [4: The statistics given above are correct. That small number of\r\n     slaveholders sustains the system of slavery, and has caused this\r\n     terrible rebellion. They are, almost to a man, rebels and\r\n     secessionists, and we may cover the South with armies, and keep\r\n     a file of soldiers upon every plantation, and not smother this\r\n     insurrection unless we break down the power of that class. Their\r\n     wealth gives them their power, and their wealth is in their\r\n     slaves. Free their negroes by an act of Emancipation, or\r\n     Confiscation, and the rebellion will crumble to pieces in a day.\r\n     Omit to do it, and it will last till doomsday.\r\n\r\n     The power of this dominant class once broken; with landed property\r\n     at the South more equally divided, a new order of things will arise\r\n     there. Where now, with their large plantations, not one acre in ten\r\n     is tilled, a system of small farms will spring into existence, and\r\n     the whole country be covered with cultivation. The six hundred\r\n     thousand men who have gone there to fight our battles, will see the\r\n     amazing fertility of the Southern soil--into which the seed is\r\n     thrown and springs up without labor into a bountiful harvest--and\r\n     many of them, if slavery is crushed out, will remain there. Thus a\r\n     new element will be introduced into the South, an element that will\r\n     speedily make it a loyal, prosperous, and _intelligent_ section of\r\n     the Union.\r\n\r\n     I would interfere with no one's rights, but a rebel in arms against\r\n     his country has no rights; all that he has 'is confiscate.' Will\r\n     the loyal people of the North submit to be ground to the earth with\r\n     taxes to pay the expenditures of a war brought upon them by these\r\n     Southern oligarchists, while the traitors are left in undisturbed\r\n     possession of every thing, and even their slaves are exempted from\r\n     taxation? It were well that our legislators should ask this\r\n     question now, and not wait till it is asked of them by THE PEOPLE.]\r\n\r\n'Yes, I mean them, and the three or four millions of poor whites--the\r\nignorant, half-starved, lazy vermin you have just seen. _They_ are the\r\nreal basis of our Southern oligarchy, as you call it,' continued the\r\nColonel, still laughing.\r\n\r\n'I thought the negro was the serf, in your feudal system?'\r\n\r\n'Both the negro and the poor whites are the serfs, but the white trash\r\nare its real support. Their votes give the small minority of\r\nslave-owners all their power. You say we control the Union. We do, and\r\nwe do it by the votes of these people, who are as far below our niggers\r\nas the niggers are below decent white men. Who that reflects that this\r\ncountry has been controlled for fifty years by such scum, would give a\r\nd---- for republican institutions?'\r\n\r\n'It does speak very badly for _your_ institutions. A system that reduces\r\none half of a white population to the level of slaves can not stand in\r\nthis country. The late election shows that the power of your 'white\r\ntrash' is broken.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it does, that's a fact. If the States should remain together, the\r\nWest would in future control the Union. We see that, and are therefore\r\ndetermined on dissolution. It is our only way to keep our niggers.'\r\n\r\n'You will have to get the consent of that same West to that project. My\r\nopinion is, your present policy will, if carried out, free every one of\r\nyour slaves.'\r\n\r\n'I don't see how. Even if we are put down--which we can not be--and are\r\nheld in the Union against our will, Government can not, by the\r\nConstitution, interfere with slavery in the States.'\r\n\r\n'I admit that, but it can confiscate the property of traitors. Every\r\nlarge slaveholder is to-day, at heart, a traitor. If this movement goes\r\non, you will commit overt acts against the Government, and in\r\nself-defense it will punish treason by taking from you the means of\r\nfuture mischief.'\r\n\r\n'The Republicans and Abolitionists might do that if they had the power,\r\nbut nearly one half of the North is on our side, and will not fight us.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps so; but if _I_ had this thing to manage, I'd put you down\r\nwithout fighting.'\r\n\r\n'How would you do it--by preaching Abolition where even the niggers\r\nwould mob you? There's not a slave in South-Carolina but would shoot\r\nGarrison or Greeley on sight.'\r\n\r\n'That may be, but if so, it is because you keep them in ignorance. Build\r\na free-school at every cross-road, and teach the poor whites, and what\r\nwould become of slavery? If these people were on a par with the farmers\r\nof New-England, would it last for an hour? Would they not see that it\r\nstands in the way of their advancement, and vote it out of existence as\r\na nuisance?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, perhaps they would; but the school-houses are not at the\r\ncross-roads, and, thank God, they will not be there in this generation.'\r\n\r\n'The greater the pity; but that which will not nourish alongside of a\r\nschool-house, can not, in the nature of things, outlast this century.\r\nIts time must soon come.'\r\n\r\n'Enough for the day is the evil thereof, I'll risk the future of\r\nslavery, if the South, in a body, goes out of the Union.'\r\n\r\n'In other words, you'll shut out schools and knowledge, in order to keep\r\nslavery in existence. The Abolitionists claim it to be a relic of\r\nbarbarism, and you admit it could not exist with general education among\r\nthe people.'\r\n\r\n'Of course it could not. If Sandy, for instance, knew he were as good a\r\nman as I am--and he would be if he were educated--do you suppose he\r\nwould vote as I tell him, go and come at my bidding, and live on my\r\ncharity? No sir! give a man knowledge, and, however poor he may be,\r\nhe'll act for himself.'\r\n\r\n'Then free-schools and general education would destroy slavery?'\r\n\r\n'Of course they would. The few can not rule when the many know their\r\nrights. But the South, and the world, are a long, way off from general\r\neducation. When it conies to that, we shall need no laws, and no\r\nslavery, for the millennium will have arrived.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad you think slavery will not exist during the millennium,' I\r\nreplied, laughing; 'but how is it that you insist the negro is naturally\r\ninferior to the white, and still admit that the 'white trash' are far\r\nbelow the black slaves?'\r\n\r\n'Education makes the difference. We educate the negro enough to make him\r\nuseful to us, but the poor white man knows nothing. He can neither read\r\nnor write, and not only that, he is not trained to any useful\r\nemployment. Sandy, here, who is a fair specimen of the tribe, obtains\r\nhis living just like an Indian, by hunting, fishing, and stealing,\r\ninterspersed with nigger-catching. His whole wealth consists of two\r\nhounds and their pups; his house--even the wooden trough his miserable\r\nchildren eat from--belongs to me. If he didn't catch a runaway nigger\r\nonce in a while, he wouldn't see a dime from one year to another.'\r\n\r\n'Then you have to support this man and his family?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, what I don't give him, he steals. Half-a-dozen others poach on me\r\nin the same way.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you set them at work?'\r\n\r\n'They can't be made to work. I have hired them time and again, hoping to\r\nmake something of them, but I never got one to work more than half-a-day\r\nat a time. It's their nature to lounge and to steal.'\r\n\r\n'Then why do you keep them about you?'\r\n\r\n'Well, to be candid, their presence is of use in keeping the blacks in\r\nsubordination, and they are worth all they cost me, because I control\r\ntheir votes.'\r\n\r\n'I thought the blacks were said to be entirely contented?'\r\n\r\n'No, not contented. I do not claim that. I only say that they are unfit\r\nfor freedom. I might cite a hundred instances in which it has been their\r\nruin.'\r\n\r\n'I have never heard of one. It seems strange to me that a man who can\r\nsupport another can not support himself.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, it's not at all strange. The slave has hands, and when the\r\nmaster gives him brains, he works well enough; but to support himself he\r\nneeds both hands and brains, and he has only hands. I'll give you a case\r\nin point: At Wilmington, N.C., some years ago lived a negro by the name\r\nof Jack Campbell. He was a slave, and he was employed, before the river\r\nbelow the town was deepened so as to admit of the passage of large\r\nvessels, in lightering cargoes up to the city. He hired his time of his\r\nmaster, and carried on business on his own account. Every one knew him,\r\nand his character for honesty, sobriety, and punctuality stood so high\r\nthat his word was considered among merchants as good as that of the\r\nfirst business-men of the place. Well, Jack's wife and children were\r\nfree, and he finally took it into his head to be free himself. He\r\narranged with his master to purchase himself within a specified time, at\r\neight hundred dollars, and was to deposit his earnings, till they\r\nreached the required sum, in the hands of a certain merchant. He went\r\non, and in three years had accumulated nearly seven hundred dollars,\r\n_when his master failed_. As the slave has no right to property, Jack's\r\nearnings belonged by law to his master, and they were attached by the\r\ncreditors, and taken to pay the master's debts. Jack then 'changed\r\nhands,' received a new owner, who also consented to his buying himself,\r\nat about the price previously agreed on. Nothing discouraged, he went to\r\nwork again. Night and day, he toiled, and it surprised every one to see\r\nso much energy and fixedness of purpose in a negro. At last, after four\r\nmore years of labor, he accomplished his purpose, and received his\r\nfree-papers. He had worked seven years--as long as Jacob toiled for\r\nRachel--for his freedom, and like the old patriarch found himself\r\ncheated at last. I was present when he received his papers from his\r\nowner, a Mr. William H. Lippitt--who still resides at Wilmington--and I\r\nshall never forget the ecstasy of joy which he showed on the occasion;\r\nhe sung and danced and laughed and wept, till my conscience smote me for\r\nholding my own niggers, when freedom might give them so much happiness.\r\nWell, he went off that day and treated some friends, and then, for three\r\ndays afterward, lay in the gutter, the entreaties of his wife and\r\nchildren having no effect on him. He swore he was free, and would do as\r\nhe 'd----d pleased.' He had previously been a class-leader in his\r\nchurch, but after getting free-papers, he forsook his previous\r\nassociates, and spent his Sundays and evenings in a bar-room. He\r\nneglected his business; people lost confidence in him, and step by step\r\nhe went down, till in five years he stink into a wretched grave. That\r\nwas the effect of freedom on _him_, and it would be so on all his race.'\r\n\r\n'It is clear,' I replied, 'he could not bear freedom, but that does not\r\nprove he might not have 'endured' it if he had never been a slave. His\r\noverjoy at obtaining liberty, after so long a struggle for it, led to\r\nhis excesses and his ruin. According to your view, neither the black nor\r\nthe poor white is competent to take care of himself. The Almighty,\r\ntherefore, has laid upon _you_ a triple burden; you not only have to\r\nprovide for yourself and your children, but for two races beneath you,\r\nthe black and the clay-eating white man. The poor nigger has a hard\r\ntime, but it seems to me you have a harder one.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's a fact, we do. I often think that if it wasn't for the color\r\nand the odor, I'd be glad to exchange places with my man Jim.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel made this last remark in a half-serious, half-comic way,\r\nthat excited my risibilities amazingly, but before I could reply, the\r\ncarriage stopped, and Jim, opening the door, announced:\r\n\r\n'We's h'ar, massa, and de prayin' am gwine on.'\r\n\r\nHad we not been absorbed in conversation, we might have discovered the\r\nlatter fact some time previous to our arrival at the church-door, for\r\nthe preacher was shouting at the top of his lungs. He evidently thought\r\nthe good Lord either a long way off, or very hard of hearing. Not\r\nwishing to disturb the congregation at their devotions, we loitered near\r\nthe doorway until the prayer was over, and in the mean time I glanced\r\naround the premises.\r\n\r\nThe 'meeting-house,' of large unhewed logs, was a story and a half in\r\nhight, and about large enough to seat comfortably a congregation of two\r\nhundred persons. It was covered with shingles, with a roof projecting\r\nsome four feet over the wall, and was surmounted at the front gable by a\r\ntower, about twelve feet square. This also was built of logs, and\r\ncontained a bell 'to call the erring to the house of prayer,' though,\r\nunfortunately, all of that character thereabouts dwelt beyond the sound\r\nof its voice. The building was located at a cross-roads about equally\r\ndistant from two little hamlets, (the nearest nine miles off,) neither\r\nof which was populous enough to singly support a church and a preacher.\r\nThe trees in the vicinity had been thinned out, so that carriages could\r\ndrive into the woods, and find under the branches shelter from the rain\r\nand the sun, and at the time of my visit, about twenty vehicles of all\r\nsorts and descriptions, from the Colonel's magnificent barouche to the\r\nrude cart drawn by a single two-horned quadruped, filled the openings.\r\nThere was a rustic simplicity about the whole scene that charmed me. The\r\nlow, rude church, the grand old pines that towered in leafy magnificence\r\naround it, and the soft, low wind, that sung a morning hymn in the\r\ngreen, wavy woods, seemed to lift the soul up to Him who inhabiteth\r\neternity, but who also visits the erring children of men.\r\n\r\nThe preacher was about to 'line out' one of Watts' psalms, when we\r\nentered the church, but he stopped short on perceiving us, and, bowing\r\nlow, waited till we had taken our seats. This action, and the\r\nsycophantic air which accompanied it, disgusted me, and turning to the\r\nColonel, I asked jocosely:\r\n\r\n'Do the chivalry exact so much obsequiousness from the country clergy'?\r\nDo you require to be bowed up to heaven?'\r\n\r\nIn a low voice, but high enough, I thought, for the preacher to hear,\r\nfor we sat very near, the Colonel replied:\r\n\r\n'He's a renegade Yankee--the meanest thing on earth.'\r\n\r\nI said no more, but entered into the services as seriously as the\r\nstrange gymnastic performances of the preacher would allow me to do, for\r\nthe truth is, he was quite as amusing as a circus clown.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Colonel's and a few other pews in the vicinity\r\nof the pulpit, all of the seats were mere rough benches, without backs,\r\nand placed so closely together as to interfere uncomfortably with the\r\nknees of the sitters. The house was full, and the congregation as\r\nattentive as any I ever saw. All classes were there; the black\r\nserving-man away off by the doorway, the poor white a little higher up,\r\nthe small turpentine-farmer a little higher still, and the wealthy\r\nplanter, of the class to which the Colonel belonged, on 'the highest\r\nseats of the synagogue,' and in close proximity to the preacher.\r\n\r\nThe 'man of prayer' was a tall, lean, raw-boned, angular-built\r\nindividual, with a thin, sharp, hatchet-face, a small sunken eye, and\r\nlong, loose hair, brushed back and falling over the collar of a seedy\r\nblack coat. He looked like nothing in the world I have ever seen, and\r\nhis pale, sallow face, and cracked, wheezy voice, were in comic keeping\r\nwith his discourse. His text was: 'Speak unto the children of Israel,\r\nthat they go forward.' And addressing the motley gathering of poor\r\nwhites and small-planters before him as the 'chosen people of God,' he\r\nurged them to press on in the mad course their State had chosen. It was\r\na political harangue, a genuine stump-speech, but its frequent allusion\r\nto the auditory as the legitimate children of the old patriarch, and the\r\nrightful heirs of all the promises, struck me as out of place in a rural\r\ndistrict of South-Carolina, however appropriate it might have been in\r\none of the large towns, before an audience of merchants and traders, who\r\nare, almost to a man, Jews.\r\n\r\nThe services over, the congregation slowly left the church. Gathered in\r\ngroups in front of the 'meeting-house,' they were engaging in a general\r\ndiscussion of the affairs of the day, when the Colonel and I emerged\r\nfrom the doorway. The better class greeted my host with considerable\r\ncordiality, but I noticed that the well-to-do, small planters, who\r\ncomposed the greater part of the assemblage, received him with decided\r\ncoolness. These people were the 'North county folks' on whom the\r\noverseer had invoked a hanging. Except that their clothing was more\r\nuncouth and ill-fashioned, and their faces generally less 'cute' of\r\nexpression, they did not differ materially in appearance from the rustic\r\ncitizens who may be seen on any pleasant Sunday gathered around the\r\ndoor-ways of the rural meeting-houses of New-England.\r\n\r\nOne of them, who was leaning against a tree, quietly lighting a pipe,\r\nwas a fair type of the whole, and as he took a part in the scene which\r\nfollowed, I will describe him. He was tall and spare, with a swinging,\r\nawkward gait, and a wiry, athletic frame. His hair, which he wore almost\r\nas long as a woman's, was coarse and black, and his face strongly\r\nmarked, and of the precise color of two small rivulets of tobacco-juice\r\nthat escaped from the corners of his mouth. He had an easy,\r\nself-possessed manner, and a careless, devil-may-care way about him,\r\nthat showed he had measured his powers, and was accustomed to 'rough it'\r\nwith the world. He wore a broadcloth coat of the fashion of some years\r\nago, but his waistcoat and nether garments of the common, reddish\r\nhomespun, were loose and ill-shaped, as if their owner did not waste\r\nthought on such trifles. His hat, as shockingly bad as Horace Greeley's,\r\nhad the inevitable broad brim, and fell over his face like a\r\ncalash-awning over a shop-window. As I approached him he extended his\r\nhand with a pleasant 'How are ye, stranger?.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' I replied, returning his grasp with equal warmth, 'how are\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Right smart, right smart, thank ye. You're--' the rest of the\r\nsentence was cut short by a gleeful exclamation from Jim, who, mounted\r\non the box of the carriage, which was drawn up on the cleared plot in\r\nfront of the meeting-house, waved an open newspaper over his head, and\r\ncalled out, as he caught sight of the Colonel:\r\n\r\n'Great news, massa, great news from Charls'on!'\r\n\r\n(The darky, while we were in church, had gone to the post-office, some\r\nfour miles away, and got the Colonel's mail, consisting of letters from\r\nhis New-York and Charleston factors, the Charleston _Courier_ and\r\n_Mercury_ and the New-York _Journal of Commerce_. The latter sheet, at\r\nthe date of which I am writing, was in wide circulation at the South,\r\nits piety (!) and its politics being then calculated with mathematical\r\nprecision for secession latitudes.)\r\n\r\n'What is it, Jim?' shouted his master. 'Give it to us.'\r\n\r\nThe darky had somehow learned to read, but holding the paper at arm's\r\nlength, and throwing himself into a theatrical attitude, he belched out,\r\nwith any amount of gesticulation, the following:\r\n\r\n'De news am, massa, and gemmen and ladies, dat de ole fort fore\r\nCharls'on hab hen devacuated by Major Andersin and de sogers, and dat\r\ndey hab stole 'way in de dark night and gone to Sumter, whar dey can't\r\nbe took; and dat de ole Gubner hab got out a procdemation dat all dat\r\ndon't lub de Aberlishen Yankees shill cum up dar and clar 'em out; and\r\nde paper say dat lots ob sogers hab cum from Gorgia and Al'bama and 'way\r\ndown Souf, to help 'em. Dis am w'at de _Currer_ say,' he continued,\r\nholding the paper up to his eyes and reading: 'Major Andersin, ob\r\nUnited States army hab 'chieved de 'stinction ob op'ning de cibil war\r\n'tween American citizens; he hab desarted Moulfrie, and by false\r\nfretexts hab took de ole Garrison and all his millinery stores to Fort\r\nSumter.'\r\n\r\n'Get down, you d----d nigger,' said the Colonel, laughing, and mounting\r\nthe carriage-box beside him. 'You can't read. Old Garrison isn't\r\nthere--he's the d----d Northern Abolitionist.'\r\n\r\n'I knows dat, Cunnel, but see dar,' holding the paper out to his master,\r\n'don't dat say he'm dar? It'm him dat make all de trubble. P'raps dis\r\nnig' can't read, but ef dat ain't readin' I'd like to know it!'\r\n\r\n'Clear out,' said the Colonel, now actually roaring with laughter; 'it's\r\nthe soldiers that the _Courier_ speaks of, not the Abolitionist.'\r\n\r\n'Read it yoursef, den, massa, I don't seed it dat way.'\r\n\r\nJim was altogether wiser than he appeared, and while he was equally as\r\nwell pleased with the news as the Colonel, he was so for an entirely\r\ndifferent reason. In the crisis which these tidings announced, he saw\r\nhope for his race.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel then read the paper to the assemblage. The news was received\r\nwith a variety of manifestations by the auditory, the larger portion, I\r\nthought, hearing it, as I did, with sincere regret.\r\n\r\n'Now is the time to stand by the State, my friends,' said my host as he\r\nfinished the reading. 'I hope every man here is ready to do his duty by\r\nold South-Carolina.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, _sar!_ if she does _har_ duty by the Union. We'll go to the death\r\nfor har just so long as she's in the right, but not a d----d step if she\r\narn't,' said the long-legged native I have introduced to the reader.\r\n\r\n'And what have _you_ to say about South-Carolina? What does, she owe to\r\n_you?_' asked the Colonel, turning on the speaker with a proud and angry\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n'More, a darned sight than she'll pay, if ye cursed 'ristocrats run her\r\nto h---- as ye'r doing. She owes me, and 'bout ten as likely niggers as\r\nye ever seed, a living, and we've d----d hard work to get it out on her\r\n_now_, let alone what's comin'.\r\n\r\n'Don't talk to me, you ill-mannered cur,' said my host, turning his back\r\non his neighbor, and directing his attention to the remainder of the\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\n'Look har, Cunnel,' replied the native, 'if ye'll jest come down from\r\nthar and throw 'way yer shootin'-irons, I'll give ye the all-firedest\r\nthrashing ye ever did get.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel gave no further heed to him, but the speaker mounted the\r\nsteps of the meeting-house and harangued the natives in a strain of rude\r\nand passionate declamation, in which my host, the aristocrats, and the\r\nSecessionists came in for about equal shares of abuse. Seeing that the\r\nnative (who, it appeared, was quite popular as a stump-speaker) was\r\ndrawing away his audience, the Colonel descended from the driver's seat,\r\nand motioning for me to follow, entered the carriage. Turning the horses\r\nhomeward, we rode off at a brisk pace.\r\n\r\n'Not much Secession about that fellow, Colonel,' I remarked, after a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n'No,' he replied, 'he's a North-Carolina 'corn-cracker,' one of the\r\nmeanest specimens of humanity extant. They're as thick as fleas in this\r\npart of the State, and about all of them are traitors.'\r\n\r\n'Traitors to the State, but true to the Union. As far as I've seen, that\r\nis the case with the middling class throughout the South.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it may be, but they generally go with us, and I reckon they will\r\nnow, when it comes to the rub. Those in the towns--the traders and\r\nmechanics--will, certain; it's only these half-way independent planters\r\nthat ever kick the traces. By the way,' continued my host, in a jocose\r\nway, 'what did you think of the preaching?'\r\n\r\n'I thought it very poor. I'd rather have heard the stump-speech, had it\r\nnot been a little too personal on you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it was the better of the two,' he replied, laughing, 'but the\r\nold devil can't afford any thing good, he don't get enough pay.'\r\n\r\n'Why, how much does he get?'\r\n\r\n'Only a hundred dollars.'\r\n\r\n'That is small. How does the man live?'\r\n\r\n'Well, he teaches the daughter of my neighbor, Captain Randall, who\r\nbelieves in praying, and gives him his board. Randall thinks that\r\nenough. The rest of the parish can't afford to pay him, and I _won't_.'\r\n\r\n'Why won't you?'\r\n\r\n'Because he's a d----d old hypocrite. He believes in the Union with all\r\nhis heart--at least, so Randall, who's a sincere Union man, says--and\r\nyet, he never sees me at meeting but he preaches a red-hot secession\r\nsermon.'\r\n\r\n'He wants to keep you in the faith,' I replied.\r\n\r\nA few more miles of sandy road took us to the mansion, where we found\r\ndinner in waiting. Meeting 'Massa Tommy'--who had staid at home with his\r\nmother--as we entered the doorway, the Colonel asked after the overseer.\r\n\r\n'He seems well enough, sir; I believe he's coming the possum over\r\nmother.'\r\n\r\n'Ill bet on it, Tommy; but he won't fool you and me, will he, my boy?'\r\nsaid his father, slapping him affectionately on the back.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I went with my host to the room of the wounded man. His\r\nhead was still bound up, and he was groaning piteously, as if in great\r\npain; but I thought there was too fresh a color in his face to be\r\nentirely natural in one who had lost so much blood, and been so severely\r\nwounded as he affected to be.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel mentioned our suspicions to Madam P----, and suggested that\r\nthe shackles should be put on him.\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, don't do that; it would be inhuman,' said the lady; 'the color\r\nis the effect of fever. If you fear he is plotting to get away, let him\r\nbe watched.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel consented, but with evident reluctance, to the arrangement,\r\nand retired to his room to take a _siesta_, while I lit a cigar, and\r\nstrolled out to the negro-quarters.\r\n\r\nMaking my way through the woods to the scene of the morning's\r\njollification, I found about a hundred darkies gathered around Jim, on\r\nthe little plot in front of Old Lucy's cabin. Jim had evidently been\r\ngiving them the news. Pausing when I came near, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Har's Massa K----, he'll say dat I tells you de trufh;' then turning to\r\nme, he said: 'Massa K----, dese darkies say dat Massa Andersin am an\r\nab'lisherner, and dat none but de ab'lisherners will fight for de Union;\r\nam dat so, sar?'\r\n\r\n'No, I reckon not, Jim; I think the whole North would fight for it if it\r\nwere necessary.'\r\n\r\n'Am dat so, massa? am dat so?' eagerly inquired a dozen of the darkies;\r\n'and am dar great many folks at de Norf--more dan dar am down har?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, you fools, didn't I tell you dat?' said Jim, as I, not exactly\r\nrelishing the idea of preaching treason, in the Colonel's absence, to\r\nhis slaves, hesitated to reply. 'Hain't I tole you,' he continued, 'dat\r\nin de big city ob New-York dar'm more folks dan dar am in all Car'lina?\r\nI'se been dar, and I knows; and Massa K----'ll tell you dat dey--'most\r\non 'em--feel mighty sorry for de brack man.'\r\n\r\n'No he won't,' I replied, 'and besides, Jim, you should not talk in this\r\nway before me; I might tell your master.'\r\n\r\n'No! you won't do dat; I knows you won't, massa. Scipio tole us he'd\r\ntrust his bery life wid _you_.'\r\n\r\n'Well, perhaps he might; it's true I would not injure _you_.' Saying\r\nthat, I turned away, though my curiosity was greatly excited to hear\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI wandered farther into the woods, and a half-hour found me near one of\r\nthe turpentine distilleries. Seating myself on a rosin barrel, I quietly\r\nfinished my cigar, and was about lighting another, when Jim made his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n'Beg pardon, Massa K----,' said the negro, bowing very low, 'but I\r\nwants to ax you one or two tings, ef you please, sar.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' I replied, 'I'll answer any thing that I ought to.'\r\n\r\n'Der yer tink, den, massa, dat dey'll git to fightin' at Charls'on?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, judging by the tone of the Charleston papers you've read to-day, I\r\nthink they will.'\r\n\r\n'And der yer tink dat de rest ob de Souf will jine wid Souf Car'lina, if\r\nshe go at it fust?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Jim, I'm inclined to think so.'\r\n\r\n'I hard you say to massa, dat ef dey goes to war,'twill free all de\r\nniggers--der you raily b'lieve dat, sar?'\r\n\r\n'_You_ heard me say that; how did you hear it?' I exclaimed, in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n'Why, sar, de front winder ob de carriage war down jess a crack, and I\r\nhard all you said.'\r\n\r\n'Did you let it down on purpose?'\r\n\r\n'P'r'aps so, massa. Whot's de use ob habin' ears, ef you don't h'ar?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose not much; and you tell all you hear to the other\r\nnegroes?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon so, massa,' said the darky, looking very demure.\r\n\r\n'That's the use of having a tongue, eh?' I replied, laughing.\r\n\r\n'Dat's it 'zaxly, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Jim, I do think the slaves will be finally freed; but it will\r\ncost more white blood to do it than all the niggers in creation are\r\nworth. Do you think the darkies would fight for their freedom?'\r\n\r\n'Fight, sar!' exclaimed the negro, straightening up his fine form, while\r\nhis usual good-natured look--passed from his face and gave way to an\r\nexpression that made him seem more like an incarnate fiend than a human\r\nbeing; 'FIGHT, sar; gib dem de chance, and den see.'\r\n\r\n'Why are you discontented? You have been at the North, and you know the\r\nblacks are as well off as the majority of the poor laboring men there.'\r\n\r\n'You say dat to me, Massa K----; you don't say it to de _Cunnel_. We are\r\nnot so well off as de pore man at de Norf! You knows dat, sar. He hab\r\nhis wife and children, and his own home; what hab we, sar? No wife, no\r\nchildren, no home; all am de white man's. Der yer tink we wouldn't fight\r\nto be free?' and he pressed his teeth together, and there passed again\r\nover his face the same look it wore the moment before.\r\n\r\n'Come, come, Jim, this may be true of your race; but it don't apply to\r\nyourself. Your master is kind and indulgent to _you_.'\r\n\r\n'He am kind to me, sar; he orter be,' said the negro, the savage\r\nexpression coming again into his eyes. For a moment he hesitated; then,\r\ntaking a step toward me, he placed his face down to mine, and hissed out\r\nthese words, every syllable seeming to come from the very bottom of his\r\nbeing. 'I tell you he orter be, sar, FUR I AM HIS OWN FATHER'S SON!'\r\n\r\n'Your brother!' I exclaimed, springing to my feet, and looking at him in\r\nblank amazement. 'It can't be true.'\r\n\r\n'It am true, sar--as true as there's a hell! His father had my mother:\r\nwhen he got tired of her, he sold her Souf. _I was too young den eben to\r\nknow her_!'\r\n\r\n'This is horrible, too horrible!' I said.\r\n\r\n'It am slavery, sar! Shouldn't we be contented?' replied the negro with\r\na grim smile. Drawing, then, a large spring-knife from his pocket, he\r\nwaved it above his head, adding: 'Ef I had all de white race dar--right\r\ndar under dat knife, don't yer tink I'd take all dar lives--all at one\r\nblow--to be FREE!'\r\n\r\n'And yet you refused to run away when the Abolitionists tempted you, at\r\nthe North. Why didn't you go then?'\r\n\r\n''Cause I had promised, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Promised the Colonel before you went?'\r\n\r\n'No, sar, he neber axed me; but _I_ can't tell you no more. P'raps\r\nScipio will, ef you ax him.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! I see; you're in that league, of which Scip is a leader. You'll get\r\ninto trouble, _sure_,' I replied, in a quick, decided tone, which\r\nstartled him.\r\n\r\n'You tole Scipio dat, sar, and what did _he_ tell you?'\r\n\r\n'That he didn't care for his life.'\r\n\r\n'No more do I, sar,' said the negro, as he turned on his heel with a\r\nproud, almost defiant gesture, and started to go.\r\n\r\n'A moment, Jim. You are very imprudent; never say these things to any\r\nother mortal; promise me that.'\r\n\r\n'You'se bery good, massa, bery good. Scipio say you's true, and he'm\r\nallers right. I ortent to hab said what I hab; but sumhow, sar, dat news\r\nbrought it all up _har_,' (laying his hand on his breast,) 'and it wud\r\ncome out.'\r\n\r\nThe tears filled his eyes as he said this, and turning away without\r\nanother word, he passed from my sight behind the trees.\r\n\r\nI was almost stunned by this strange revelation, but the more I\r\nreflected on it, the more probable it appeared. Now, too, that my\r\nthoughts were turned in that direction, I called to mind a certain\r\nresemblance between the Colonel and the negro that I had not heeded\r\nbefore. Though one was a high-bred Southern gentleman, claiming an old\r\nand proud descent, and the other a poor African slave, they had some\r\nstriking peculiarities which might indicate a common origin. The\r\nlikeness was not in their features, for Jim's face was of the\r\nunmistakable negro type, and his skin of a hue so dark that it seemed\r\nimpossible he could be the son of a white man, (I afterward learned that\r\nhis mother was a black of the deepest dye,) but it was in their form and\r\ngeneral bearing. They had the same closely-knit and sinewy frame, the\r\nsame erect, elastic step, the same rare blending of good-natured ease\r\nand dignity--to which I have already alluded as characteristic of the\r\nColonel--and in the wild burst of passion that accompanied the negro's\r\ndisclosure of their relationship, I saw the same fierce, unbridled\r\ntemper, whose outbreaks I had witnessed in my host.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange fate was theirs! Two brothers--the one the owner of three\r\nhundred slaves, and the first man of his district--the other, a bonded\r\nmenial, and so poor that the very bread he ate, the clothes he wore,\r\nwere another's! How terribly on him had fallen the curse pronounced on\r\nhis race!\r\n\r\nI passed the remainder of the afternoon in my room, and did not again\r\nmeet my host until the family assembled at the tea-table. Jim then\r\noccupied his accustomed seat behind the Colonel's chair, and my host was\r\nin more than his usual spirits, though Madam P----, I thought, wore a\r\nsad and absent look.\r\n\r\nThe conversation rambled over a wide range of subjects, and was carried\r\non mainly by the Colonel and myself; but toward the close of the meal\r\nthe lady said to me:\r\n\r\n'Mr. K----, Sam and young Junius are to be buried this evening. If you\r\nhave never seen a negro funeral, perhaps you'd like to attend.'\r\n\r\n'I will be happy to accompany you, Madam, if you go,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said the lady.\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! Alice, you'll not go into the woods on so cold a night as this!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think I ought to. Our people will expect me.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour after nightfall when we took our way to the\r\nburial-ground. The moon had risen, but the clouds which gathered when\r\nthe sun went down, covered its face, and were fast spreading their\r\nthick, black shadows over the little collection of negro-houses. Near\r\ntwo new-made graves were gathered some two hundred men and women, as\r\ndark as the night that was setting around them. As we entered the circle\r\nthe old preacher pointed to the seats reserved for us, and the sable\r\ncrowd fell back a few paces, as if, even in the presence of death, they\r\ndid not forget the difference between their race and ours.\r\n\r\nScattered here and there among the trees, torches of lightwood threw a\r\nwild and fitful light over the little cluster of graves, and revealed\r\nthe long, straight boxes of rough pine that held the remains of the two\r\nnegroes, and lit up the score of russet mounds beneath which slept the\r\ndusky kinsmen who had gone before them.\r\n\r\nThe simple head-boards that marked these humble graves chronicled no\r\nbad biography or senseless rhyme, and told no false tales of lives that\r\nhad better not have been, but 'SAM, AGE 22;' 'POMPEY;' 'JAKE'S ELIZA;;\r\n'AUNT SUE;' 'AUNT LUCY'S TOM;' 'JOE;' and other like inscriptions,\r\nscratched in rough characters on those unplaned boards, were all the\r\nrecords there. The rude tenants had passed away and 'left no sign;'\r\ntheir birth, their age, their deeds, were alike unknown--unknown, but\r\nnot forgotten; for are they not written in the book of His\r\nremembrance--and when He counteth up his jewels, may not some of them be\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nThe queer, grotesque dress, and sad, earnest looks of the black group;\r\nthe red, fitful glare of the blazing pine, and the white faces of the\r\ntapped trees, gleaming through the gloom like so many sheeted-ghosts\r\ngathered to some death-carnival, made up a strange, wild scene--the\r\nstrangest and the wildest I had ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe covers of the rude coffins were not yet nailed down, and when we\r\narrived, the blacks were one by one passing before them, taking a last\r\nlook at the faces of the dead. Soon, Junius, holding his weeping wife by\r\nthe hand, approached the smaller of the two boxes, which held all that\r\nwas left of their first-born. The mother kneeling by its side, kissed\r\nagain and again the cold, shrunken lips, and sobbed as if her heart\r\nwould break; while the strong frame of the father shook convulsively,\r\nas, choking down the great sorrow which welled up in his throat, he\r\nturned away from his boy forever. As he did so, old Pompey said:\r\n\r\n'Don't grebe, June, he'm whar de wicked cease from trubbling, whar de\r\nweary am at rest.'\r\n\r\n'I knows it; I knows it, Uncle. I knows de Lord am bery good to take 'im\r\n'way; but why did he take de young chile, and leab de ole man har?'\r\n\r\n'De little sapling dat grow in de shade may die while it'm young; de\r\ngreat tree dat grow in de sun must lib till de ax cut him down.'\r\n\r\nThese words were the one drop wanting to make the great grief which was\r\nswelling in the negro's heart overflow. Giving one low, wild cry, he\r\nfolded his wife in his arms, and burst into a paroxysm of tears.\r\n\r\n'Come now, my chil'ren,' said the old preacher, kneeling down, 'let us\r\npray.'\r\n\r\nThe whole assemblage then knelt on the cold ground, while the old man\r\nprayed, and a more sincere, heart-touching prayer never went up from\r\nhuman lips to that God 'who hath made of one blood all nations that\r\ndwell on the face of the earth.' Though clothed in rags, and in feeble\r\nold age, a slave, at the mercy of a cruel task-master, that old man was\r\nricher far than his master. His simple faith, which looked through the\r\ndarkness surrounding him into the clear and radiant light of the unseen\r\nland, was of far more worth than all the wealth and glory of this world.\r\nI know not why it was, but as I looked at him in the dim, red light\r\nwhich fell on his upturned face, and cast a strange halo around his bent\r\nform, I thought of Stephen, as he gazed upward and saw heaven open, and\r\n'the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the throne of God.'\r\n\r\nRising from his knees, the old preacher turned slowly to the black mass\r\nthat encircled him, and said:\r\n\r\n'My dear bredderin and sisters, de Lord say dat 'de dust shill return to\r\nde earth as it war, and de spirit to Him who gabe it,' and now, 'cordin'\r\nto dat text, my friends, we'm gwine to put dis dust (pointing to the two\r\ncoffins) in de groun' whar it cum from, and whar it shill lay till de\r\nblessed Lord blow de great trumpet on de resumrection mornin'. De\r\nspirits of our brudders har de Lord hab already took to hisseff. 'Our\r\nbrudders,' I say, my chil'ren, 'case ebery one dat de Lord hab made am\r\nbrudders to you and to me, whedder dey'm bad or good, white or brack.\r\n\r\n'Dis young chile, who hab gone 'way and leff his pore fader and mudder\r\nsuffrin' all ober wid grief, _he_ hab gone to de Lord, _shore_. _He_\r\nneber did no wrong; he allers 'bey'd his massa, and he neber said no\r\nhard word, nor found no fault, not eben w'en de cruel, bad oberseer put\r\nde load so heaby on him dat it kill him. Yes, my bredderin and sisters,\r\n_he_ hab gone to de Lord; gone whar dey don't work in de swamps; whar de\r\nlittle chil'ren don't tote de big shingles fru de water up to dar knees.\r\nNo swamps am dar; no shingles am cut dar; dey doan't need 'em, 'case dar\r\nhous'n haint builded wid hands, for dey'm all built by de Lord, and\r\ngib'n to de good niggers, ready-made, and for nuffin'. De Lord don't\r\nsay, like as our massa do, 'Pomp, dar's de logs and de shingles,' (dey'm\r\nallers pore shingles, de kine dat woant sell; but he say, '_dey'm_ good\r\n'nuff for niggers, ef de roof do leak.) De Lord doan't say: 'Now, Pomp,\r\nyou go to work and build you' own house; but mine dat you does you task\r\nall de time, jess de same!' But de Lord--de bressed Lord--He say, w'en\r\nwe goes up dar, 'Dar, Pomp, dar's de house dat I'se been a buildin' for\r\nyou eber sence 'de foundation ob de worle.' It'm done now, and you kin\r\ncum in; your room am jess ready, and ole Sal and de chil'ren dat I tuk\r\n'way from you eber so long ago, and dat you mourned ober and cried ober\r\nas ef you'd neber see dem agin, _dar dey am, all on 'em, a waiting for\r\nyou_. Dey'm been fixin' up de house 'spressly for you all dese long\r\nyears, and dey'be got it all nice and comfible now.' Yas, my frens,\r\nglory be to Him, dat's what our Heabenly massa say, and who ob you\r\nwouldn't hab sich a massa as dat? a massa dat don't set you no hard\r\ntasks, and dat gibs you 'nuff to eat, and time to rest and to sing and\r\nto play. A massa dat doan't keep no Yankee oberseer to foller you 'bout\r\nwid de big free-lashed whip; but dat leads you hisseff round to de green\r\npastures and de still waters; and w'en you'm a-faint and a-tired, and\r\ncan't go no furder, dat takes you up in his arms, and carries you in his\r\nbosom. What pore darky am dar dat wudn't hab sich a massa? What one ob\r\nus, eben ef we had to work so hard as we does now, wudn't tink hisseff\r\nde happiest nigger in de hull worle, ef he could hab sich hous'n to lib\r\nin as dem? dem hous'n 'not made wid hands, eternal in de heabens!'\r\n\r\n'But glory, glory to de Lord! my chil'ren, wese all got dat massa, ef we\r\nonly knowd it, and he'm buildin' dem housn up dar, now, for ebery one ob\r\nus dat am tryin' to be good and to lub one anoder. _For ebery one ob\r\nus_, I say, and we kin all git de fine hous'n ef we try.\r\n\r\n'Recolember, too, my brudders, dat our great Massa am rich, bery rich,\r\nand He kin do all he promise. _He_ won't say, w'en wese worked ober time\r\nto git some little ting to comfort de sick chile, 'I knows, Pomp, you'se\r\ndone de work, and I did 'gree to gib you de pay; but de fact am, Pomp,\r\nde frost hab come so sudden dis yar, dat I'se loss de hull ob de sebenfh\r\ndippin', and I'se pore, so pore, de chile must go widout dis time.' No,\r\nno, brudders, de bressed Lord He neber talk so. He neber break, 'case de\r\nsebenfh dip am shet off, or 'case de price of turpentime gwo down at de\r\nNorf. He neber sell his niggers down Souf, 'case he lose his money on de\r\nhoss-race. No, my chil'ren, our HEABENLY Massa am rich, RICH, I say. He\r\nown all dis worle, and all de odor worles dat am shinin' up dar in de\r\nsky. He own dem all; but he tink more ob one ob you, more ob one ob\r\nyou--pore, ignorant brack folks dat you am--dan ob all dem great worles!\r\nWho wouldn't belong, to sich a Massa as dat? Who wouldn't be his\r\nnigger--not his slave--He don't hab no slaves--but his chile; and 'ef\r\nhis chile, den his heir, de heir ob God, and de joint heir wid Christ.'\r\nO my chil'ren! tink of dat! de heir ob de Lord ob all de earth and all\r\nde sky! What white man kin be more'n dat?\r\n\r\n'Don't none ob you say you'm too wicked to be His chile; 'ca'se you\r\nan't. He lubs de wicked ones de best, 'ca'se dey need his lub de most.\r\nYas, my brudders, eben de wickedest, ef dey's only sorry, and turn roun'\r\nand leab off dar bad ways, he lub de bery best ob all, 'ca'se he'm all\r\nlub and pity.\r\n\r\n'Sam, har, my children, war wicked, but don't _we_ pity him; don't _we_\r\ntink he had a hard time, and don't we tink de bad oberseer, who'm layin'\r\ndar in de house jess ready to gwo and answer for it--don't we tink he\r\ngabe Sam bery great probincation?'\r\n\r\n'Dat's so,' said a dozen of the auditors.\r\n\r\n'Den don't you 'spose dat de blessed Lord know all dat, and dat He pity\r\nSam too? If we pore sinners feel sorry for him, an't de Lord's heart\r\nbigger'n our'n, and an't he more sorry for him? Don't you tink dat ef He\r\nlub and pity de bery worse whites, dat He lub and pity pore Sam, who\r\nwarn't so bery bad, arter all? Don't you think He'll gib Sam a house?\r\nP'r'aps 'twon't be one ob de fine hous'n, but won't it be a comfible\r\nhouse, dat hain't no cracks, and one dat'll keep out de wind and de\r\nrain? And don't you s'pose, my chil'ren, dat it'll be big 'nuff for\r\nJule, too--dat pore, repentin' chile, whose heart am clean broke, 'ca'se\r\nshe hab broughten dis on Sam--and won't de Lord--de good Lord--de\r\ntender-hearted Lord--won't He touch Sam's heart, and coax him to forgib\r\nJule, and to take her inter his house up dar? I knows he will, my\r\nchil'ren. I knows--'\r\n\r\nHere the old negro paused abruptly; for there was a quick swaying in the\r\ncrowd--a hasty rush--a wild cry--and Sam's wife burst into the open\r\nspace around the preacher, and fell at the old man's feet. Throwing her\r\narms wildly around him, she shrieked out:\r\n\r\n'Say dat agin, Uncle Pomp! for de lub ob de good Lord, oh! say dat\r\nagin!'\r\n\r\nBending down, the old man raised her gently in his arms, and folding her\r\nthere, as he would have folded a child, he said, in a voice thick with\r\nemotion:\r\n\r\n'It am so, Juley. I knows dat Sam will forgib you, and take you wid him\r\nup dar.'\r\n\r\nFastening her arms frantically around Pompey's neck, the poor woman\r\nburst into a paroxysm of grief, while the old man's tears fell in great\r\ndrops on her upturned face, and many a dark cheek near was wet, as with\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe scene had lasted a few minutes, and I was turning away to hide the\r\nemotion that was fast filling my eyes, and creeping up, with a choking\r\nfeeling, to my throat, when the Colonel, from the farther edge of the\r\ngroup, called out:\r\n\r\n'Take that d----d ---- away--take her away, Pomp!'\r\n\r\nThe old negro turned toward his master with a sad, grieved look, but\r\ngave no heed to the words.\r\n\r\n'Take her away, some of you, I say,' again cried the Colonel. 'Pomp, you\r\nmustn't keep these niggers all night in the cold.'\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her master's voice the metif woman fell to the ground as\r\nif struck by a Minie-ball. Soon several negroes lifted her up to bear\r\nher away; but she struggled violently, and rent the woods with her wild\r\ncries for 'one more look at Sam.'\r\n\r\n'Look at him, you d----d ----, then go, and don't let me see you again.'\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on the face of the dead, and covered the cold lips\r\nwith her kisses; then rose, and with a weak, uncertain step, staggered\r\nout into the darkness.\r\n\r\n'The system' that had so seared and hardened that man's heart, must have\r\nbeen begotten in the lowest hell.\r\n\r\nThe old preacher said no more, but four stout negro men stepped forward,\r\nnailed down the lids, and lowered the rough boxes into the ground.\r\nTurning to Madam P----, I saw her face was red with weeping. She rose to\r\ngo just as the first earth fell, with a dull, heavy sound, on the rude\r\ncoffins; and giving her my arm, I led her from the scene.\r\n\r\nAs we walked slowly back to the house, a low wail--half a chant, half a\r\ndirge--rose from the black crowd, and floated off on the still night\r\nair, till it died away amid the far woods, in a strange, wild moan. With\r\nthat sad, wild music in our ears, we entered the mansion.\r\n\r\nAs we seated ourselves by the bright wood-fire on the library hearth,\r\nobeying a sudden impulse which I could not restrain, I said to Madam\r\nP----:\r\n\r\n'The Colonel's treatment of that poor woman is inexplicable to me. Why\r\nis he so hard with her? It is not in keeping with what I have seen of\r\nhis character.'\r\n\r\n'The Colonel is a peculiar man,' replied the lady. 'Noble, generous, and\r\na true friend, he is also a bitter, implacable enemy. When he once\r\nconceives a dislike, his feelings become even vindictive; and never\r\nhaving had an ungratified wish, he does not know how to feel for the\r\nsorrows of those beneath him. Sam, though a proud, headstrong, unruly\r\ncharacter, was a great favorite with him; he felt his death much; and as\r\nhe attributes it to Jule, he feels terribly bitter toward her. She will\r\nhave to be sold to get her out of his way, for he will _never_ forgive\r\nher.'\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the Colonel joined us, and when he at last made\r\nhis appearance, he seemed in no mood for conversation. The lady soon\r\nretired; but feeling unlike sleep, I took down a book from the shelves,\r\ndrew my chair near the fire, and fell to reading. The Colonel, too, was\r\ndeep in the newspapers, till, after a while, Jim entered the room:\r\n\r\n'I'se cum to ax ef you've nuffin more to-night, Cunnel?' said the negro.\r\n\r\n'No, nothing, Jim,' replied his master; 'but, stay--hadn't you better\r\nsleep in front of Moye's door?'\r\n\r\n'Dunno, sar; jess as you say.'\r\n\r\n'I think you'd better,' returned the Colonel.\r\n\r\nWith a 'Yas, massa,' the darky left the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel shortly rose, and bade me 'good night.' I continued reading\r\ntill the clock struck eleven, when I laid the book aside and went to my\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nI slept, as I have said before, on the lower floor, and was obliged to\r\npass by the door of the overseer's apartment as I went to mine. Wrapped\r\nin his blanket, and stretched at full length on the ground, Jim lay\r\nthere, fast asleep. I passed on, thinking of the wisdom of placing a\r\ntired negro on guard over an acute and desperate Yankee.\r\n\r\nI rose in the morning with the sun, and had partly donned my clothing,\r\nwhen I heard a loud uproar in the hall. Opening my door, I saw Jim\r\npounding vehemently at the Colonel's room, and looking as pale as is\r\npossible with a person of his completion.\r\n\r\n'What the d---l is the matter?' asked his master, who now, partly\r\ndressed, stepped into the hall.\r\n\r\n'Moye hab gone, sar; he'm gone and took Firefly (my host's\r\nfive-thousand-dollar thorough-bred) wid him.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Colonel stood stupified; then, his face turning to a\r\ncold, clayey white, he seized the black by the throat, and hurled him to\r\nthe floor. Planting his thick boot on the man's face, he seemed about to\r\ndash out his brains with its ironed heel, when, at that instant, the\r\noctoroon woman rushed, in her night-clothes, from his room, and with\r\ndesperate energy pushed him aside, exclaiming: 'What would you do?\r\nremember WHO HE IS!'\r\n\r\nThe negro rose, and the Colonel, without a word, passed into his\r\napartment. What followed will be the subject of another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PICAYUNE BUTLER._\r\n\r\n'General Butler was a barber,'\r\n  So the Pelicans were raving;\r\nNow you've got him in your harbor,\r\n  Tell us how you like his shaving?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LITERARY NOTICES._\r\n\r\nLECTURES ON THE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE. Delivered at the royal Institution\r\n     of Great Britain in April, May, and June, 1861. By MAX MULLER,\r\n     Fellow of All Souls College, etc. From the second London edition,\r\n     revised. New-York: Charles Scribner, Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nWithin the memory of man one could in England or America be 'very well\r\neducated,' as the word went, and yet remain grossly ignorant of the\r\nsimplest elements of the history of language. In those days Latin was\r\nheld by scholars to be derived from Greek--where the Greek came from\r\nnobody knew or cared, though it was thought, from Hebrew. German was a\r\njargon, Provençal a '_patois_,' and Sanscrit an obsolete tongue, held in\r\nreverence by Hindoo savages. The vast connections of language with\r\nhistory were generally ignored. Hebrew was assumed, as a matter of\r\ncourse, to have been the primeval language, and it was wicked to doubt\r\nit. Then came Sir William Jones, Carey, Wilkins, Forster, Colebrooke,\r\nand the other Anglo-Indian scholars, and the world learned what it ought\r\nto have learned from the Jesuits, that there was in the East a very\r\nancient language--Sanscrit--'of wonderful structure, more perfect than\r\nGreek, more copious than Latin, more exquisitely refined than either;\r\nbearing to both a strong affinity,' and stranger still, containing a\r\nvast amount of words almost identical with many in all European and many\r\nOriental tongues. This was an apocalypse of truth to many--but a source\r\nof grief to the orthodox believers that Greek and Latin were either\r\naboriginal languages, or modifications of Hebrew. Hence the blind, and\r\nin some cases untruthful warfare made on the Sanscrit discoveries, as in\r\nthe case of Dugald Stewart.\r\n\r\n     'Dugald Stewart was too wise not to see that the conclusions drawn\r\n     from the facts about Sanscrit were inevitable. He therefore _denied\r\n     the reality of such a language as Sanscrit altogether_, and wrote\r\n     his famous essay to prove that Sanscrit had been put together,\r\n     after the model of Greek and Latin, by those arch forgers and\r\n     liars, the Brahmins, and that the whole of Sanscrit literature was\r\n     an imposture.'\r\n\r\nBut it was all of no avail. In 1808 Frederick Schlegel's work, _On the\r\nLanguage and Wisdom of the Indians_, first 'boldly faced the facts and\r\nconclusions of Sanscrit scholarship, and became,' with all its faults,\r\nthe 'foundation for the science of language.' Its great result may be\r\ngiven in one sentence--it embraced at a glance the languages of India,\r\nPersia, Greece, Italy, and Northern Europe, and riveted them by the\r\nsimple name 'Indo-Germanic.' Then in this school, begun by English\r\nindustry and shaped by German genius, came Franz Bopp, with his great\r\ncomparative grammar of the Indo-Germanic tongues, and the enormous\r\nlabors of Lassen, Rosen, Burnouf, and W. von Humboldt--a man to whose\r\nincredible ability of every kind, as to his secret diplomatic influence,\r\nhistory has never done justice. Grimm, and Rask--the first great Zend\r\nscholar--were among these early explorers, who have been followed by so\r\nmany scholars, until some knowledge not merely of Greek and Latin, but\r\nof the relations of _all_ languages, has become essential to a truly\r\ngood education.\r\n\r\nYet after all, Sanscrit, it was soon seen, was not the parent, but '_the\r\nelder sister_' of the Indo-Germanic languages. Behind Greek, Latin, and\r\nSanscrit, Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic tongues, lurks a lost\r\nlanguage--the mysterious Aryan, which, reëchoed through the tones of\r\nthose six remaining Pleiades, its sisters, speaks of a mighty race\r\nwhich once, it may be, ruled supreme over a hundred lands, or perchance\r\nsole in the Caucasus. It is strange to see philologists slowly\r\nreconstructing, here and there, fragments of the Aryan,\r\n\r\n    'And speak in a tongue which man speaks no more.'\r\n\r\nAmong the many excellent elementary and introductory works on philology\r\nwhich have appeared of late years, this of Müller's is on several\r\naccounts the best. It is clearly written, so as to be within the\r\ncomprehension of any reader of ordinary intelligence, and we can hardly\r\nconceive that any such person would not find it an extremely\r\nentertaining book. Its author is a _genial_ writer--he writes with a\r\nrelish and with real power--he loves knowledge, and wishes others to\r\nshare it with him. Language, he holds--though the idea is not new with\r\nhim--springs from a very few hundred roots, which are the _phonetic\r\ntypes_ produced by a power inherent in human nature. Every substance has\r\nits peculiar _ring_ when struck--man, under the action of certain laws,\r\nmust develop first onomato-poietic sounds, and finally language. With\r\nthis we take leave of this excellent work, trusting that the public will\r\nextend to it the favor which it so amply deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE AND LETTERS OF WASHINGTON IRVING. By his Nephew, PIERRE M. IRVING.\r\n     Vol. I. New-York: G.P. Putnam. Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nThis work has a strong, we might say an extraordinary claim to the\r\ninterest of the most general reader, in its very first paragraph, since\r\nin it we are told that Washington Irving, on committing to his nephew\r\nPierre the vast mass of papers requisite to his biography, remarked:\r\n'Somebody will be writing my life when I am gone, and I wish you to do\r\nit. You must promise me that you will.' So with unusual wealth of\r\nmaterial, gathered together for the purpose by the subject of the\r\nbiography himself, the work has been begun, by the person whom Irving\r\njudged best fitted for it.\r\n\r\nAnd a delightful work it is, not a page without something of special\r\nrelish, as might be anticipated in the chronicle of a life which is\r\nthickly studded with personal association or correspondence with almost\r\nevery intellectual eminence either of Europe or America during the past\r\nhalf-century. But apart from this, there is a racy Irving-y flavor from\r\nthe very beginning, long before the wide world had incorporated Irving\r\ninto its fraternity of great men, in the details of life, of home travel\r\nand of homely incident, as set forth in extracts from his letters, which\r\nis irresistibly charming. Full as this portion of the life is, we can\r\nnot resist the hope that it will be greatly enlarged in subsequent\r\neditions, and that more copious extracts will be given from those\r\nletters, to the humblest of which the writer invariably communicates an\r\nindefinable fascination. In them, as in his regular 'writings,' we find\r\nthe simplest incident narrated always without exaggeration--always as\r\nbriefly as possible, yet told so quaintly and humorously withal, that we\r\nwonder at the piquancy which it assumes. It is the trouble with great\r\nmen that they are, for lack of authentic anecdotes and details of their\r\ndaily life, apt to retire into myths. Such will not be the case with\r\nIrving. The _reality_, the life-likeness of these letters, and of the\r\n_ana_ drawn from them, will keep him, Washington Irving the New-Yorker,\r\nalive and breathing before the world to all time. In these chapters a\r\nvail seems lifted from what was growing obscure in our knowledge of\r\nsocial life in the youth of our fathers. Our only wish, in reading, is\r\nfor more of it. But the life gathers interest as it proceeds. From\r\nAmerica it extends to Europe, and we meet the names of Humboldt, De\r\nStaël, Allston, Vanderlyn, Mrs. Siddons, as among his associates even in\r\nearly youth. So through Home Again and in Europe Again there is a\r\nconstant succession of personal experience and wide opportunity to know\r\nthe world. Did our limits permit, we would gladly cite largely from\r\nthese pages, for it is long since the press has given to the world a\r\nbook so richly quotable. But the best service we can render the reader\r\nis to refer him to the work itself, which is as well worth reading as\r\nany thing that its illustrious subject ever wrote, since in it we have\r\nmost admirably reflected Irving himself; the best loved of our writers,\r\nand the man who did more, so far as intellectual effort is concerned, to\r\nhonor our country than any American who ever lived.\r\n\r\nBEAUTIES SELECTED FROM THE WRITINGS OF THOMAS DE QUINCKY. With a Portrait.\r\n    Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nWe are not sure that this is not the very first book of other than\r\npictorial beauties which we ever regarded with patience. Books of\r\nliterary 'beauties' are like musical matinées--the first act of one\r\nopera--the grand dying-scene from another--all very pretty, but not on\r\nthe whole satisfactory, or entitling one to claim from it alone any real\r\nknowledge of the original whole. Yet this volume we have found\r\nfascinating, have flitted from page to page, backwards and forwards, [it\r\nis a great advantage in a book of 'unconnections' that one may\r\n_conscientiously_ skip about,] and concluded by thanking in our heart\r\nthe judicious Eclectic, whoever he may be--who mosaicked these bits into\r\nan enduring picture of De Quincey-ism. For really in it, by virtue of\r\nselection, collection, and recollection, we have given an authentic\r\ncabinet of specimens more directly suggestive of the course and\r\nsoul-idioms of the author than many minds would gather from reading\r\n_all_ that he ever wrote. Only one thing seems needed--the great\r\noriginal commentary or essay on De Quincey, which these Beauties would\r\nmost happily illustrate. It seems to rise shadowy before us--a sort of\r\ndead-letter ghost of a glorious book which craves life and has it not.\r\nWe trust that our suggestion may induce some admirer of the Opium-Eater\r\nto have prepared an interleaved copy of these Beauties, and perfect the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH IN THE ARMY; OR THE FOUR CENTURIONS. By Rev. WM. A. SCOTT, D.D.,\r\n     of San Francisco. New-York: Carleton, No. 413 Broadway. Boston:\r\n     Crosby and Nichols. 1862.\r\n\r\nSince every one is doing their 'little utmost' for the army, Mr. Scott\r\nhath contributed his mite in a work on the four captains of hundreds\r\nmentioned in the Bible--the first whereof was he of Capernaum; the\r\nsecond, the one commanding at the crucifixion; the third, that of\r\nCesarea; and the fourth, Julius, the centurion who had Paul in charge\r\nduring his voyage to Rome. We are glad to learn, from the close\r\nresearches and critical acumen of Rev. Mr. Scott, that there is very\r\ngood ground for concluding that all of these centurions were so\r\nimpressed by the thrilling scenes which they witnessed, and the society\r\nwith which they mingled, as to have eventually been converted and saved,\r\na consummation which may possibly have escaped the observation of most\r\nreaders, who, absorbed in their contemplation of the great _dramatis\r\npersonae_, seldom give thought as to what the effect on the minor\r\ncharacters must have been. It is worth observing that our author is\r\nthoroughly earnest in his exhortations--at times almost naively so. If\r\nhe be often rather over-inclined to threaten grim damnation to an\r\nalarming majority, and describe with a relish the eternal horrors which\r\nhang around the second death, in good old-fashioned style, still we must\r\nremember that he sincerely means what he says, and is a Puritan of the\r\nancient stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EDITOR'S TABLE._\r\n\r\nThere is something intensely American in such phrases as 'manifest\r\ndestiny,' 'mission,' and 'call,' and we may add, something very vigorous\r\nmay be found in the character of him who uses them. They are expressions\r\nwhich admit no alternative, no second possibility. The man of a\r\n'mission,' or of a 'manifest destiny,' may be a fanatic, but he will be\r\nno flincher; he will strive to the bitter end, and fall dead in the\r\ntraces; _but he will succeed_.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to learn that there is growing up in the army, and of course\r\nfrom it in all the homes of the whole country, a fixed impression that\r\nthe South is inevitably destined to be 'Northed' or 'free-labored,' as\r\nthe result of this war. The intelligent farmer in the ranks, who has\r\nlearned his superiority to 'Secesh,' as a soldier, and who _knows_\r\nhimself to be superior to any Southern in all matters of information and\r\npractical creative _power_, looks with scorn at the worn-out fields,\r\nwasteful agriculture, and general shiftlessness of the natives, and\r\nsays, with a contemptuous laugh: 'We will get better crops out of the\r\nland, and manage it in another fashion, when _we_ settle down here.' Not\r\nless scornfully does the mechanic look down on the clumsy, labor-wasting\r\ncontrivances of the negro or negro-stupified white man, and agree with\r\nhis mate that 'these people will never be of much account until we take\r\nthem in hand.'\r\n\r\nMaster-mechanic, master-farmer, _you are right_. These people _are_ your\r\ninferiors; with all their boasts and brags of 'culture,' you could teach\r\nthem, by your shrewder intelligence, at a glance, the short cut to\r\nalmost any thing at which their intellects might be employed; and you\r\nindulge in a very natural feeling, when, as conquerors, in glancing over\r\ntheir Canaan, you involuntarily plan what you will do some day, _if_ a\r\nfarm should by chance be your share of the bounty-money, when the war is\r\nover. For it is absurd to suppose that such a country will continue\r\nforever a prey to the wasting and exhaustive disease of the\r\nplantation-system, or that the black will always, as at present,\r\ninefficiently and awkwardly fulfill those mechanic labors which a keen\r\nwhite workman can better manage. Wherever the hand of the Northman\r\ntouches, in these times, it shows a superior touch, whether in\r\nimprovising a six-action cotton-gin, in repairing locomotives, or in\r\nsarcastically seizing a 'Secesh' newspaper and reëditing it with a storm\r\nof fun and piquancy such as its doleful columns never witnessed of old.\r\nIn this and in a thousand ways, the Northern soldier realizes that he is\r\nin a land of inferiors, and a very rich land at that. At this point, his\r\nspeculations on manifest destiny may very appropriately begin. There is\r\nno harm in suffering this idea to take firm hold. Like ultimate\r\nemancipation, it may be assumed as a fact, all to be determined in due\r\ntime, according to the progress of events, as wisely laid down by\r\nPresident Lincoln, without hurry, without feverish haste, simply guided\r\nby the firm determination that eventually it must be.\r\n\r\nWe can not insist too strongly on this great truth, that when a nation\r\nmakes up its mind that a certain event _must_ take place, and acts\r\ncalmly in the spirit of perfect persuasion, very little is really needed\r\nto hasten the wished-for consummation. Events suddenly spring up to aid,\r\nand in due time all is accomplished. Those who strive to hurry it retard\r\nit, those who work to drag it back hasten it. Never yet on earth was a\r\nreal conviction crushed or prematurely realized. So it is, so it will be\r\nwith this 'Northing' of the South. Let the country simply familiarize\r\nitself with the idea, and the idea will advance as rapidly as need be.\r\nIn it lies the only solution of the great problem of reconciling the\r\nSouth and the North; the sooner we make up our minds to the fact, the\r\nbetter; and, on the other hand, the more deliberately and calmly we\r\nproceed to the work, the more certain will its accomplishment be. Events\r\nare now working to aid us with tremendous power and rapidity--faith, a\r\njudicious guiding of the current as it runs, is all that is at present\r\nrequired to insure a happy fulfillment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe degree to which a vindictive and malignant opposition to every thing\r\nfor the sake of 'the party' can be carried, has been well illustrated in\r\nthe amount and variety of slander which has been heaped by the\r\nSouthern-rights, sympathizing Democratic press on the efforts of those\r\nnoble-hearted women who have endeavored to do something to alleviate the\r\ncondition of the thousands of contrabands, who are many without clothes,\r\nemployment, or the slightest idea of what they are to do. It would be\r\nhard to imagine any thing more harmless or more perfectly free from any\r\nthing like sinister or selfish motives than have been the conduct and\r\nmotives of the noble women who have assumed this mission. Florence\r\nNightingale undertook nothing nobler; and the world will some day\r\nrecognize the deserts of those who strove against every obstacle to\r\nrelieve the sufferings and enlighten the ignorance of the blacks--among\r\nwhom were thousands of women and little children. Such being the literal\r\ntruth, what does the reader think of such a paragraph as the following,\r\nwhich we find going the rounds of the Boston Courier and other journals\r\nof the same political faith?\r\n\r\n     '_On dit_, that some of the schoolmarms who went to South-Carolina\r\n     several weeks ago, are not so intent upon 'teaching the young ideas\r\n     how to shoot,' as upon flirting with the officers, in a manner not\r\n     entirely consistent with morality. General Hunter is going to send\r\n     some of the misbehaving misses home.'\r\n\r\nIf there is a loathsome, cowardly, infamous phrase, it is that of _on\r\ndit_, 'they say,' 'it is said,' when used to assail the virtue of\r\nwomen--above all, of women engaged in such a cause as that in question.\r\nWe believe in our heart, this whole story to be a slander of the meanest\r\ndescription possible--a piece of as dirty innuendo as ever disgraced a\r\nDemocratic paper. The spirit of the viper is apparent in every line of\r\nit. Yet it is in perfect keeping with the storm of abuse and falsehood\r\nwhich has been heaped on these 'contraband' missionaries, teachers, and\r\nnurses, since they went their way. They have been accused of pilfering,\r\nof lying, of doing nothing, of corrupting the blacks, of going out only\r\nto speculate, and, as might have been expected, we have at last the\r\nunfailing resort of the lying coward--a dirty hint as to breaking the\r\nseventh commandment--all according to the devilish old Jesuit precept of,\r\n'_Calumniare fortiter aliquis koerebit_'--'Slander boldly, something will\r\nbe sure to stick.' And to such a depth of degradation--to the hinting\r\naway the characters of young ladies because they try to teach the poor\r\ncontrabands--can _men_ descend 'for the sake of the _party'!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf late years, those soundest of philanthropists, the men of\r\ncommon-sense who labor unweariedly to facilitate exchanges between\r\ncivilized nations, have endeavored to promote in every possible manner\r\nthe adoption of the same system of currency, weights and measures among\r\ncivilized nations. It has been accepted as a rule beyond all debate,\r\nthat if such mediums of business could be adopted--nay, if a common\r\nlanguage even were in use, industry would receive an incalculable\r\nimpulse, and the production of capital be enormously increased.\r\n\r\nNot so, however, thinks John M. Vernon, of New-Orleans, who, stimulated\r\nby the purest secession sentiments, and urged by the most legitimate\r\nsecession and 'State rights' logic, has developed a new principle of\r\nexclusiveness by devising a new system of decimal currency, which he\r\nthus recommends to the rebel Congress:\r\n\r\n     'We are a separate and distinct people, influenced by different\r\n     interests and sentiments from the vandals who would subjugate us.\r\n     Our manners and customs are different; our tastes and talents are\r\n     different; our geographical position is different; and in\r\n     conformity with natural laws, nature and instinct, our\r\n     currency,--weights and measures, should be different.\r\n\r\n     'The basis of integral limit of value proposed for our currency, is\r\n     the star, which is to be divided into one hundred equal parts, each\r\n     part to be called a centime, namely: 10 centimes--1 tropic;\r\n     10 tropics--1 star; 10 stars--1 sol.\r\n\r\n     'These denominations for our currency have been selected for three\r\n     reasons: first, they are appropriate to ourselves as a people;\r\n     second, they are emblems of cheerfulness, honor, honesty of\r\n     purpose, solidity, and stability; and third, the words used are\r\n     simple, easily remembered, and are common to several languages. I\r\n     will, in addition, observe that similar characteristics distinguish\r\n     the proposed tables of weights and measures.'\r\n\r\n'Stars'--'centimes'--'tropics,' and 'sols.' Why these words should be\r\nmore significant of cheerfulness, honor, honesty, and solidity, than\r\ndollars and dimes, cents and mills, is not, as yet, apparent. As set\r\nforth in this recommendation, it would really appear that the root of\r\nall evil would have its evil properties extracted by giving the radical\r\na different name. To be sure, the wages of sin thus far in the world's\r\nhistory, have generally been found equivalent to death, whether they are\r\ntermed guineas, francs, thalers, cobangs, pesos, sequins, ducats, or\r\ndollars. But in Dixie--happy Dixie!--they only need another name, and\r\nlo! a miracle is to be wrought at once.\r\n\r\nThere is something in this whole proposition which accurately embodies\r\nthe whole Southern policy. While the rest of the world is working to\r\nassimilate into civilization, they are laboring to get away and\r\napart--to be different from everybody else--to remain provincial and\r\n'peculiar.' It is the working of the same spirit which inspires the\r\ndesire to substitute 'State rights' or individual will, or, in plain\r\nterms, lawlessness and barbarism for enlightenment and common rights. It\r\nis a craving for darkness instead of light, for antiquated feudal\r\nfalsehood instead of republican truth; and it will meet with the destiny\r\nwhich awaits every struggle against the great and holy cause of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_KYNG COTEN._\r\n\r\nA 'DARK' CONCEIT.\r\n\r\n(_Being an ensample of a longe poeme._)\r\n\r\n  O muse! that did me somedeal favour erst,\r\n    Whereas I piped my silly oaten reede,\r\n  And songs in homely guise to mine reherst,\r\n    Well pleased with maiden's smilings for my meed;\r\n    Sweet muse, do give my Pegasus good speede,\r\n  And send to him of thy high, potent might,\r\n    Whiles mortalls I all of my theme do rede,\r\n  Thatte is the story of a doughty knight,\r\n  Who eftsoons wageth war, Kyng COTEN is he hight.\r\n\r\n  Kyng Coten cometh of a goodly race,\r\n    Though black it was, as records sothly tell;\r\n  But thatte is nought, which only is the face,\r\n    And ne the hart, where alle goode beings dwell;\r\n    For witness him the puissant Hannibal,\r\n  Who was in veray sooth a Black-a-Moor;\r\n    And Cleopatra, Egypt's darksome belle,\r\n  And others, great on earth, a hundred score;\r\n  Howbeit, ilke kyng was white, which doth amaze me sore.\r\n\r\n  Kyng Coten cometh of a goodly race,\r\n    As born of fathers clean as many as\r\n  The sands thatte doe the mighty sea-shore grace,\r\n    But black, as sayde, as dark is Erebus.\r\n    His rule the Southron Federation was,\r\n  Thatte was a part of great Columbia,\r\n    Which was as fayre a clyme as man mote pass;\r\n  And situate where Vesper holds his swaye,\r\n  But habited wilome by men of salvage fray.\r\n\r\n  Farre in the North he had an enimie,\r\n    Who certes was the knight's true soveraine,\r\n  Who likéd not his wicked slaverie,\r\n    Which 'cross God's will was counter-wisely laine,\r\n    Whiles he himself, it seemeth now right playne,\r\n  Did seek to have a kyngdom of his kynde,\r\n    Where he, as tyrant-like, mote lonly raine;\r\n  So to a treacherie he fetched his mynde,\r\n  Which soon was rent in four, and sent upon each wynde.\r\n\r\n  His enimie thatte liveth in the North,\r\n    Who, after all, was not his enimie,\r\n  Ydeemed he was a gentilman of worth,\r\n    Too proud to make so vile a villianie,\r\n    And, therefore, did ne tent his railerie,\r\n  But went his ways, as was his wont wilome;\r\n    Goliah, he turned out eftsoons, ah! me,\r\n  Who leaned upon his speare when David come,\r\n  And laughed to scorn the sillie boy his threat'ning doom.\r\n\r\n  But when his stronghold in ye Southron land,\r\n    Of formidable front, Forte Sumter hight,\r\n  Did fall into Kyng Coten's rebell hand,\r\n    Who coward-wise did challenge to the fight,\r\n    Some several men again his host of might;\r\n  Then Samuel, for so was he yclipt,\r\n    Begun in batail's gear himself to dight,\r\n  As being fooled by him with whom he sippt,\r\n  And hied him out, loud crying, 'Treason must be nippt!'\r\n\r\n  O ye who doe the crusades' musters tell,\r\n    In wise that maketh myndes incredulous,\r\n  And paynte how like Dan Neptune's sweeping swell\r\n    The North bore down on the perfidious!\r\n    Ne nigh so potent thatte as was with us;\r\n  Where men, like locusts, darkened all the land,\r\n    As marched they toward the place that's treacherous,\r\n  And shippes, that eke did follow the command,\r\n  Like forests, motion-got, doe walk along the strand.\r\n\r\n  Fierce battails ther were fought upon the ground,\r\n  Thatte rob'd the heavens alle in ayer dunne;\r\n  And shoke the world as doth the thunder's sound,\r\n    Till, soth to say, it well-nigh was undone:\r\n    But of them alle, ther is an one\r\n  That frayle pen dispairs for to descrive,\r\n  Which mortalls call the Battail of Bull Run;\r\n  But why I mote ne tell, as I'm alive,\r\n  Unless it haply he ther _running_ did most thrive.\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE MINOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Our Orientalist' appears this month with\r\n\r\n_EGYPT IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS._\r\n\r\nBY A FAST TRAVELER.\r\n\r\n'You ought to go to the East,' said Mr. Swift, with a wave of his hand;\r\n'I've been there, and seen it under peculiar circumstances.'\r\n\r\n'Explain, O howaga! Give us the facts.\r\n\r\n'Immediately. Just place the punch-pitcher where I can reach it easily.\r\nThat's right! Light another Cabañas. So; now for it. In 1858, month of\r\nDecember, I was settled in comfortable quarters in the Santa Lucia,\r\nNaples, and fully expected to winter there at my ease, when, to my\r\ndisgust, I received letters from England, briefly ordering me by first\r\nsteamer to Alexandria, thence per railroad to Cairo, there to see the\r\nhead of a certain banking-house; transact my business, and return to\r\nNaples with all possible dispatch. No sooner said than done; there was\r\none of the Messagérie steamers up for Malta next day; got my passport\r\nvisaed, secured berth, all right. Next night I was steaming it past\r\nStromboli, next morning in Messina; then Malta, where I found steamer up\r\nfor Alexandria that night; in four days was off that port, at six\r\no'clock in the morning, and at half-past eight o'clock was in the cars,\r\nlanding in Cairo at four o'clock in the afternoon. Posted from the\r\nrailroad-station to the banker's, saw my man, arranged my business, was\r\nto receive instructions at seven o'clock the next morning, and at eight\r\no'clock take the return train to Alexandria, where a steamer was to sail\r\nnext day, that would carry me back to Naples, _presto_! as the jugglers\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n'There, breathe a little, and take another glass of punch, while I\r\nrecall my day in the East.\r\n\r\n'Through at the banker's, he recommended me to the Hotel ----, where I\r\nwould find a good table, clean rooms, and none of my English\r\ncompatriots. I love my native land and my countrymen _in it_, but as for\r\nthem out of it, and as Bohemians--ugh! I am too much of a wolf myself to\r\nlove wolves. Arrived at the hotel, with my head swimming with\r\npalm-trees, railroad, turbans, tarbooshes, veiled women, camels, pipes,\r\ndust, donkeys, oceans of blue calico, groaning water-wheels, the Nile,\r\nfar-off view of the Pyramids, etc., I at once asked the headwaiter for a\r\nroom, water, towels; he passed me into the hands of a very tall Berber\r\nanswering to the name of Yusef, who was dressed in flowing garments and\r\ntarboosh, and who was one of the gentlest beings entitled to wear\r\nbreeches I have ever seen; he had feet that in my recollection seem a\r\nyard long, and how he managed to move so noiselessly, unless both pedals\r\nwere soft-shod, worries me to the present time. Well, at six o'clock the\r\ngong sounded for dinner, and out I went over marble floors to the dining\r\nhall, where I found only three other guests, who saluted me courteously\r\nwhen I entered, and at a signal from Yusef, a compromise between a bow\r\nand a salaam, we seated ourselves at table. Of the three guests, one was\r\nparticularly a marked man, apart from his costume, that of a cavalry\r\nofficer in the Pacha's service; there was something grand in his face,\r\nlarge blue eyes, full of humor and _bonhommie_, a prominent nose, a\r\nbroad forehead, burned brown with the sun, his head covered with the\r\nomnipresent tarboosh, a mustache like Cartouche's; such was my\r\n_vis-à-vis_ at the hotel-table.\r\n\r\n'In conversation with this officer, it turned up that one of my most\r\nintimate friends was his cousin, and so we had a bottle of old\r\nEast-India pale sherry over that; then we had another to finally cement\r\nour acquaintance; I said finally--I should say, finally for dinner.\r\n\r\n'I have seen the interiors of more than three hundred hotels in Europe,\r\nAfrica, and America; but I have yet to see one that appeared so\r\noutrageously romantic as that of the Hotel ----, at Cairo, after that\r\nsecond bottle of sherry! The divans on which we reposed, the curious\r\ninterlacing of the figures on the ceiling, the raised marble floor at\r\nthe end of the room overlooking the street, the arabesques on the doors,\r\nand finally the never-ending masquerade-ball going on in the street\r\nunder the divans where we sat and smoked.\r\n\r\n'I can't tell you how it happened, but after very small cups of very\r\nblack coffee and a pousse café, in the officer's room, of genuine\r\nkirschwasser and good curaçoa, I was mounted on a bay horse; there was a\r\ndapple-gray alongside of me; and running ahead of us, to clear the way,\r\nthe officer's _sais_ afoot, ready to hold our horses when we halted. We\r\nwere quickly mounted and off like the wind, past turbans, flowing\r\nbournouses, tarbooshes, past grand old mosques, petty cafés, where the\r\nfaithful were squatting on bamboo-seats, smoking pipes or drinking\r\ncoffee-grounds, while listening to a storyteller, possibly relating some\r\nstory in the _Arabian Nights_; then we were through the bazaars, all\r\nclosed now and silent; then up in the citadel, and through the mosque of\r\nYusef; then down and scouring over the flying sand among the grand old\r\ntombs of the Mamelukes and of the caliphs; then off at break-neck speed\r\ntoward the Mokatamma mountains, from a rise on the lower spur of one of\r\nwhich we saw, in the shadow of the coming night, the Pyramids and the\r\nslow-flowing Nile.\r\n\r\n'Again we were in Cairo, and now threading narrow street after street,\r\nthe fall of our horses' hoofs hardly heard on the unpaved ways, as we\r\nwere passing under overhanging balconies covered with lace-work\r\nlattices. As it grew darker, our _sais_ preceded us with lighted\r\nlantern, shouting to pedestrians, blind and halt, to clear the road for\r\nthe coming effendis.\r\n\r\n'_Halte la!_\r\n\r\n'My foaming bay was reined in with a strong hand, I leaped from the\r\nsaddle, and found the _sais_ at hand to hold our horses, while we saw\r\nthe seventh heaven of the Koran, and by no means _al Hotama_.\r\n\r\n'With a foresight indicating an old campaigner, the officer produced a\r\ncouple of bottles of sherry from the capacious folds of the _sais_'\r\nmantle, and unlocking the door of the house in front of which we stood,\r\ninvited me to enter. Two or three turns, a court-yard full of\r\nrose-bushes, and an enormous palm-tree, a fountain shooting up its\r\nsparkling waters in the moonlight, a clapping of hands, chibouks, sherry\r\ncooled in the fountain.\r\n\r\n'Then, in the moonlight, the gleam of white flowing garments, the\r\nnervous thrill breathed in from perfumes filling the evening air; the\r\ngreat swimming eyes; the kiss; the ah!--other bottles of sherry. The\r\nfingans of coffee, the pipe of Latakiah tobacco, the blowing a cloud\r\ninto dreamland, while Fatima or Zoe insists on taking a puff with you.\r\n\r\n'But as she said, '_Hathih al-kissah moaththirah_, which, in the\r\nvernacular, is. 'This history is affecting,' so let us pass it by. We\r\nfinished those two bottles of sherry, and if Mohammed, in his majesty,\r\nrefuses admittance to two Peris into paradise, because they drank sherry\r\nthat night, let the sins be on our shoulders, WE are to blame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Next morning, at seven o'clock, I was at the banker's, and received his\r\norders, and at six o'clock that evening was steaming out of Alexandria,\r\nbound to Naples _via_ Malta. A little over twenty-four hours, and I had\r\nSEEN THE ORIENT THROUGH SHERRY--pale, golden, and serenely beautiful!\r\n\r\n'Pass the punch.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVery welcome is our pleasant contributor--he who of late discoursed on\r\n'honeyed thefts' and rural religious discipline--and now, in the\r\npresent letter, he gives us his views on meals, feeds, banquets,\r\nsymposia, or by whatever name the reader may choose to designate\r\nassemblies for the purpose of eating.\r\n\r\n     Please make room at this table, right here, for me. Surely at a\r\n     table of such dimensions, there should be plenty of room. Many a\r\n     table-scene do I now recall, in days gone by, 'all of which I saw,\r\n     and part of which I was,' but nothing like this. Tables of all\r\n     sorts and sizes, but never a CONTINENTAL table before. I suppose\r\n     the nearest approach to it was _the_ picnic dinner the wee\r\n     youngsters used to eat off the _ground_! A CONTINENTAL table! The\r\n     most hospitable idea imaginable. Give place! Do you demand my\r\n     credentials, my card, my ticket? Here we have it all; a little note\r\n     from mine host, Mr. LELAND, inviting the bearer to this monthly\r\n     repast, and requesting, very properly--it was the way we always\r\n     did, when we used to get up picnics--that the receiver of the note\r\n     bring some sort of refreshments along. Thank you. This seat is very\r\n     comfortable. What more appropriate, at such a time, than the\r\n     discussion of _the Meal?_\r\n\r\n     I protest I am no glutton; in fact, I despise the man whose\r\n     meal-times are the epochs of his life; yet I frankly confess to\r\n     emotions of a very positive character, in contemplating the\r\n     associations of the table, and I admit farther, that I take\r\n     pleasure in the reality as well as in the imagination. I like to be\r\n     'one of the company,' whether in palace or in farm-house. I always\r\n     brighten up when I see the dining-room door thrown open to an angle\r\n     hospitably obtuse, and am pleased alike with the politely-worded\r\n     request, 'Will the ladies and gentlemen please walk out and partake\r\n     of some refreshments?' or the blunt, kindly voice of mine host,\r\n     'Come, friends; dinner's ready.' Still I assert my freedom from any\r\n     slavish fondness for the creature comforts. It is not the bill of\r\n     fare that so pleases me. In fact, some of the best meals of which I\r\n     have ever partaken, were those the materials of which I could not\r\n     have remembered twenty minutes after. Exquisite palatal pleasures,\r\n     then, are not a _sine qua non_ in the enjoyment of table comforts.\r\n     No, indeed. There is a condiment which is calculated to impart a\r\n     high relish to the humblest fare; but without this charmed\r\n     seasoning, every banquet is a failure. Solomon was a man of nice\r\n     observation, even in so humble a matter as a meal. Let him reveal\r\n     the secret in his own words: 'Better is a dinner of herbs, where\r\n     LOVE is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.'\r\n\r\n     By a merciful arrangement of Providence, man is so constituted that\r\n     he may think, talk, and eat, all at one and the same time. Hence,\r\n     the table is often the scene of animated and very interesting\r\n     conversations, provided _love is there_. Many of our Saviour's most\r\n     interesting and instructive discourses were delivered while\r\n     'sitting at meat,' and the 'table-talk' of some authors is\r\n     decidedly the most meritorious of all their performances.\r\n\r\n     But the truth is, there are not many meals where love _is_ entirely\r\n     absent. Cheerfulness is naturally connected with eating; eating\r\n     begets it probably. It is difficult for a man to eat at all, if he\r\n     is in a bad humor. Quite impossible, if he is in a rage; especially\r\n     if he is obliged to sit down to his dinner in company with the man\r\n     he hates. There are so many little kind offices that guests must\r\n     perform for each other at table, so many delicate compliments may\r\n     be paid to those we love or revere, by polite attentions to them,\r\n     and so necessary, indeed, have these become to our notion of a\r\n     satisfactory repast, that to banish such amiable usages from our\r\n     tables would be not only to degrade us to the level of the brute,\r\n     but would deprive us of a most humanising and refining means of\r\n     enjoyment. How beautiful and necessary, then, is the arrangement by\r\n     which, morning, noon, and night, (I pity folks who only eat twice a\r\n     day,) the members of the household are brought together in such\r\n     kindly intercourse around the family board! How seldom would they\r\n     assemble thus pleasantly, were it not for the meal!\r\n\r\n     The little wounds and scratches which the sharp edges of our\r\n     characters will inflict upon each other, when brought together in\r\n     the necessary contact of daily intercourse, would otherwise be\r\n     suffered to fret and vex us sorely; but before they have had time\r\n     to fester and inflame, meal-time comes, and brings with it the\r\n     magic, mollifying oil.\r\n\r\n     It is meet, then, (we spell the word with two e's, mind you,) that,\r\n     on any occasion of public rejoicing, the banquet should be an\r\n     indispensable accompaniment. The accomplishment of some important\r\n     public enterprise, the celebration of the birth-days of great and\r\n     good men, a nation's holidays, the reünions of friends engaged in a\r\n     common cause, are occasions in which the dinner, very properly,\r\n     constitutes one of the leading features.\r\n\r\n     And what can be more exhilarating than the innocent mirthfulness,\r\n     the unaffected kindnesses, the witty speeches, the sprightly\r\n     conversations which are universally incident to such occasions? No\r\n     wonder Lycurgus decreed that the Spartans should eat in public.\r\n     Ostensibly, it was for the sake of the grave conversations of the\r\n     elders at such times, but really, I imagine, it was to keep the\r\n     citizens (who had been at swords' points with each other) in a good\r\n     humor, by bringing them around a common table.\r\n\r\n     He knew that if any thing would soften their mutual asperities and\r\n     cultivate mutual good feeling, such a measure would. Would it not\r\n     be well for modern times to take a hint here? Had I been appointed\r\n     architect of the Capitol, I think I could have saved the feuds\r\n     which long ago sprang up, and which have resulted in, and will yet\r\n     bring about, alas! we know not how much bloodshed. I would have\r\n     constructed a couple of immense dining-rooms, with all the\r\n     necessary appurtenances. Just to think how different would have\r\n     been the aspect of things in the chamber where Sumner once lay\r\n     bleeding, and in the hall where a gentleman, in a mêlée, '_stubbed\r\n     his toe and fell_!' There would have been Mr. Breckinridge, in a\r\n     canopied seat at the head of one of the tables, rapping the Senate\r\n     to order with his knife-handle, and Mr. Orr at the head of the\r\n     other, uncovering an immense tureen, with the remark that '_the\r\n     House will now proceed to business_!' How strange it would be to\r\n     hear any angry debate at such a time! Imagine a Congressman helping\r\n     himself to a batter-cake and at the same time calling his\r\n     brother-member a liar! or throwing down his napkin, by way of\r\n     challenge to '_the gentleman on the opposite side of the table_!'\r\n     Think of Keitt politely handing Grow the cream-pitcher, and\r\n     attempting to knock him down before the meal was dispatched. Had\r\n     the discussion of the Lecompton Constitution been carried on\r\n     simultaneously with that of a couple of dozen roast turkeys, I\r\n     sometimes think we might have avoided this war.\r\n\r\n     Not only in public but in private rejoicings, is the table the\r\n     scene of chief enjoyment. When was it that the fatted calf was\r\n     killed? On what occasion was the water turned into wine? What\r\n     better way to rejoice over the return of a long-absent one than to\r\n     meet him around the hospitable table? Ye gods! let your mouths\r\n     water! There's a feast ahead for our brave soldiers, when they come\r\n     home from this war, that will make your tables look beggarly. I\r\n     refer to that auspicious moment when the patriot now baring his\r\n     bosom to the bloody brunt of war, shall sit down once more to the\r\n     table, in his own dear home, however humble, and partake of the\r\n     cheerful meal in peace, with his wife and his little ones about\r\n     him. Oh! for the luxury of that first meal! I almost feel as if I\r\n     could endure the hardships of the fierce campaign that precedes it.\r\n\r\n     There is no memory so pleasant to me as that of the annual reünion\r\n     of my aunts and uncles, with their respective troops of cousins, at\r\n     the house of my dear grandmother of blessed memory. It was pleasant\r\n     to watch the conveyances one by one coming in, laden with friends\r\n     who had traveled many a weary mile to be present on the great\r\n     occasion. It was pleasant to witness the mutual recognitions of\r\n     brothers and sisters with their respective wives and husbands; to\r\n     observe the transports of the little fellows, in their hearty\r\n     greetings, after a twelve months' separation, and to hear their\r\n     expressions of mingled surprise and delight on being introduced to\r\n     the strange _little_ cousins, whose presence increased the number\r\n     considerably above the preceding census. But the culminating point\r\n     was yet to come. That was attained when all the brothers and\r\n     sisters had gathered around the great long table, just as they did\r\n     when they were children, with their dear mother at the head,\r\n     surveying the scene in quiet enjoyment, and one of the 'older boys'\r\n     at the foot, to ask a blessing. There were the waffle-cakes, baked\r\n     in the irons which had furnished every cake for that table for the\r\n     last quarter of a century. There was the roast-turkey, which\r\n     grandma had been putting through a generous system of dietetics for\r\n     weeks, preparatory to this occasion. It rested on the same old\r\n     turkey-plate, with its two great birds sitting on a rose-bush, and\r\n     by its side was the great old carving-knife, which had from time\r\n     immemorial been the instrument of dissection on such occasions. And\r\n     there was maple-molasses from Uncle D----'s 'sugar-camp,' and\r\n     cheese from Aunt N----'s press, and honey from Uncle T----'s hives,\r\n     and oranges which Aunt I----, who lived in the city, had provided,\r\n     and all contained in the old-fashioned plates and dishes of a\r\n     preceding generation.\r\n\r\n     I discover I am treating my subject in a very desultory manner.\r\n     Perhaps I should have stated that under the head of the complete\r\n     genus, _meal_, there are three distinct species, public, social,\r\n     and private. That the grand banquet, celebrating some great man's\r\n     birth, or the success of some noble public enterprise, with its\r\n     assemblages of the great and the good from every part of the\r\n     country; the Fourth of July festival, in honor of our nation's\r\n     independence, with its speeches, its drums, its toasts, and its\r\n     cannon; the '_table d'hôte_,' or in plain English, the hotel\r\n     dinner-table, so remarkable for the multitude of its dishes and the\r\n     meagreness of their contents; the harvest-feast, the exact opposite\r\n     of the last-named, even to the mellow thirds and fifths that come\r\n     floating over the valleys from the old-fashioned dinner-horn,\r\n     calling in the tired laborers; its musical invitation in such\r\n     striking contrast with the unimagined horrors of the gong that\r\n     bellows its expectant victims to their meals; the family repast,\r\n     where one so often feels gratified with the delicate compliment of\r\n     a mother, a sister, or a wife, in placing some favorite dish or\r\n     flower near his plate; the annual gatherings of jolly alumni; the\r\n     delightful concourse of relatives and friends; the gleesome picnic\r\n     lunch, with its grassy carpet and log seats; the luxurious\r\n     oyster-supper, with its temptations 'to carry the thing too far;'\r\n     the festival at the donation-party, which, in common parlance,\r\n     would be called a dish of 'all sorts;' the self-boarding student's\r\n     desolate corn-cake, baked in a pan of multifarious use: all these\r\n     are so many modifications under their respective species.\r\n\r\n     Let me remark, in conclusion, that there are some meals from which\r\n     I pray to be delivered. There is the noisy dinner of the\r\n     country-town _tavern_ or railroad station, where each individual\r\n     seems particularly anxious that number _one_ should be provided\r\n     for, and where, in truth, he is obliged often to make pretty\r\n     vigorous efforts, if he succeeds. Again, have you ever observed how\r\n     gloomy is the look of those who for the first time gather around\r\n     the table, after the departure of a friend? The breakfast was\r\n     earlier than usual, and the dishes were suffered to stand and the\r\n     beds to go unmade, and housemaid, chamber-maid, cook, and\r\n     seamstress, all engaged in the _mélée_ of packing up, and of course\r\n     came in for their share of 'good-bys.' After the guests were fairly\r\n     off, 'things took a stand-still' for a while. All hands sat down\r\n     and rested, and looked very blank, and didn't know just where to\r\n     begin. Slowly, confusion began to relax _his_ hold, and order, by\r\n     degrees, resumed _her_ sway; (for the life of me, I can't bring\r\n     myself to determine the genders in any other way.) But when, at\r\n     last, the dinner-hour came, how strangely silent were the eaters!\r\n     Ah! if the departed one have gone to his long home, how _solemn_ is\r\n     this first meeting of the family, after their return to their\r\n     lonely home! It may be the sire whose place at the head of the\r\n     table is now vacant, and whose silvery voice we no longer hear\r\n     humbly invoking the divine blessing; or perhaps the mother, and how\r\n     studiously we keep our eye away from the seat where her generous\r\n     hand was wont to pour our tea. Perhaps the little one, the idol of\r\n     the household, whose chirruping voice was wont to set us all\r\n     laughing with droll remarks, expressed in baby dialect. How we miss\r\n     the little high-chair that was always drawn up 'close by papa!' How\r\n     our eyes will swim and our hearts swell up and choke us when we see\r\n     it pushed back into the corner, now silent and vacant! Hast thou\r\n     not wept thus? Be grateful. Thou hast been spared one of life's\r\n     keenest pangs.\r\n\r\nThou speakest well. Dr. Doran has pleased us with his _Table Traits_,\r\nbut a great book yet remains to be written on the social power of meals.\r\nThe immortals were never so lordly as when assembled at the celestial\r\ntable, where inextinguishable laughter went the rounds with the nectar.\r\nThe heroes of Valhalla were most glorious over the ever-growing\r\nroast-boar and never-failing mead. Heine suggests a millennial banquet\r\nof all nations, where the French are to have the place of honor, for\r\ntheir improvements in freedom and in cookery, and Master Rabelais could\r\nimagine nothing more genial than when in the _Moyen de Parvenir_, he\r\nplaced all the gay, gallant, wise, brave, genial, joyous dames and\r\ndemoiselles, knights, and scholars of all ages at one eternal supper.\r\nAh! yes; it matters but little what is 'gatherounded,' as a quaint\r\nAmericanism hath it, so that the wit, and smiles, and good-fellowship be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the newspapers--we know not on what authority--that\r\nCharles A. Dana, late of the New-York _Tribune_, will probably receive\r\nan important appointment in the army. A man of iron will, of indomitable\r\nenergy, undoubted courage, and of an inexhaustible genius, which\r\ndisplays itself by mastering every subject as by intuition, Dana is one\r\nwhom, of all others, we would wish to see actively employed in the war.\r\nWe have described him in by-gone days as one who was 'an editor by\r\ndestiny and a soldier by nature,' and sincerely trust that his career\r\nwill yet happily confer upon him military honors. No man in America--we\r\nspeak advisedly--has labored more assiduously, or with more sterling\r\nhonest conviction in politics, than Charles A. Dana. The influence which\r\nhe has exerted has been immense, and it is fit that it be recognized.\r\nMen who, like him, combine stern integrity with vigorous practical\r\ntalent, have a claim to lead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking songs which the war has brought forth, we must\r\nclass that grim Puritanical lyric, 'The Kansas John Brown,' which\r\nappeared originally in the Kansas _Herald_, and which is, as we are\r\ninformed, extensively sung in the army. The words are as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE KANSAS JOHN BROWN SONG.\r\n\r\n  Old John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\r\n  While the bondmen all are weeping whom he ventured for to save;\r\n  But though he lost his life a-fighting for the slave,\r\n        His soul is marching on.\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n        His soul is marching on.\r\n\r\n  John Brown was a hero undaunted, true and brave,\r\n  And Kansas knew his valor when he fought her rights to save;\r\n  And now, though the grass grows green above his grave,\r\n        His soul is marching on.\r\n\r\n  He captured Harper's Ferry with his nineteen men so few,\r\n  And frightened Old Virginia till she trembled through and through;\r\n  They hung him for a traitor--themselves a traitor crew,\r\n        But his soul is marching on.\r\n\r\n  John Brown was John the Baptist of the Christ we are to see;\r\n  CHRIST, who of the bondmen shall the Liberator be;\r\n  And soon through all the South the slaves shall all be free,\r\n        For his soul goes marching on.\r\n\r\n  John Brown he was a soldier--a soldier of the LORD;\r\n  John Brown he was a martyr--a martyr to the WORD;\r\n  And he made the gallows holy when he perished by the cord,\r\n        For his soul goes marching on.\r\n\r\n  The battle that John Brown begun, he looks from heaven to view,\r\n  On the army of the Union with its flag, red, white and blue;\r\n  _And the angels shall sing hymns o'er the deeds we mean to do_,\r\n        _As we go marching on!_\r\n\r\n  Ye soldiers of JESUS, then strike it while you may,\r\n  The death-blow of Oppression in a better time and way,\r\n  For the dawn of Old John Brown is a-brightening into day,\r\n        And his soul is marching on.\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n          Glory, glory, Hallelujah!\r\n        His soul is marching on.\r\n\r\nThere! if the soldiers of Cromwell and of Ireton had any lyric to beat\r\n_that_, we should like to see it. Among its rough and rude rhymes gleams\r\nout a fierce fire which we supposed was long since extinct. Verily, old\r\nFather Puritan is _not_ dead yet, neither does he sleep; and to judge from\r\nwhat we have heard of the effects of this song among the soldiers, we\r\nshould say that grim Old John Brown himself, far from perishing, is even\r\nnow terribly alive. There is something fearful in the inspiration which\r\ncan inspire songs like this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'GALLI VAN T' is welcome, and will be 'welcomer' when he again visits us\r\nin another letter like _this_:\r\n\r\n     DEAR CONTINENTAL: I have a friend who is not an artful man, though\r\n     he be full of art; and yesterday evening he told me the following:\r\n\r\n     'In my early days, when I took views of burly farmers and their\r\n     bouncing daughters in oil, and painted portraits of their favorite\r\n     horses for a very moderate _honorarium_, and in short, was the\r\n     artist of a small country town--why, then, to tell the truth, I was\r\n     held to be one of the greatest painters in existence. Since\r\n     studying abroad, and settling down in New-York--'\r\n\r\n     'And getting your name up among the first,' I added.\r\n\r\n     'Never mind that--I'm not 'the greatest painter that ever lived'\r\n     here. But in Spodunk, I was. Folks 'admired to see me.' I was a man\r\n     that 'had got talent into him,' and the village damsels invited me\r\n     to tea. There were occasional drawbacks, to be sure. One day a man\r\n     who had heard that I had painted Doctor Hewls's house, called and\r\n     asked me what I would charge to paint his little 'humsted.' I\r\n     offered to do it for twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n     'He gave me a shrewd gimlet-look and said:\r\n\r\n     'Find your own paint--o' course?'\r\n\r\n     ''Of course,' I replied.\r\n\r\n     ''What color?'\r\n\r\n     ''Why, the same color you now have,' was my astonished answer.\r\n\r\n     ''Wall, I don't know. My wife kind o' thinks that turtle-color\r\n     would suit our house better than Spanish brown. You put on two\r\n     coats, of course?'\r\n\r\n     'I now saw what he meant, and roaring with laughter, explained to\r\n     him that there was a difference between a painter of houses and a\r\n     house-painter.\r\n\r\n     'One morning I was interrupted by a grim, Herculean, stern-looking\r\n     young fellow--one who was manifestly a man of facts--who, with a\r\n     brief introduction of himself, asked if I could teach 'the pictur\r\n     business.' I signified my assent, and while talking of terms,\r\n     continued painting away at a landscape. I noticed that my visitor\r\n     glanced at my work at first as if puzzled, and then with an air of\r\n     contempt. Finally he inquired:\r\n\r\n     '''S _that_ the way you make your pictures?'\r\n\r\n     ''That is it,' I replied.\r\n\r\n     ''Do you have to keep workin' it in, bit by bit, _slow_--like as a\r\n     gal works woosted-patterns?'\r\n\r\n     ''Yes, and sometimes much slower, to paint well.'\r\n\r\n     ''How long 'll it take to learn your trade?'\r\n\r\n     ''Well, if you've any genius for it, you may become a tolerable\r\n     artist in two years.'\r\n\r\n     ''Two--_thunder_! Why, a man could learn to make shoes, in that\r\n     time!'\r\n\r\n     ''Very likely. There is not one man in a hundred, who can make\r\n     shoes, who would ever become even a middling sort of artist.'\r\n\r\n     ''_Darn_ paintin'!' was the reply of my visitor, as he took up his\r\n     club to depart--his hat had not been removed during the whole of\r\n     the visit. 'Darn paintin'! I thought you did the thing with\r\n     stencils, and finished it up with a comb and a scraper. Mister, I\r\n     don't want to hurt your feeling--but 'cordin' to _my_ way o'\r\n     thinkin', paintin' as _you_ do it, an't a trade at all--it's\r\n     nothin' but a darned despisable _fine art!_'\r\n\r\n     'And with this candid statement of his views, my lost pupil turned\r\n     to go. I burst out laughing. He turned around squarely, and\r\n     presenting an angry front not unlike that of a mad bull, inquired\r\n     abruptly, as he glared at me:\r\n\r\n     ''Maybe you'd like to paint my portrit?'\r\n\r\n     'I looked at him steadily in the eyes, as I gravely took up my\r\n     spatula, (I knew he thought it some deadly kind of dagger,) and\r\n     answered:\r\n\r\n     ''I don't paint animals.\r\n\r\n     'He gave me a parting look, and 'abscondulated.'

RAND, JR.\r\n\r\n  Not to the Past whose smouldering embers lie,\r\n   Sad relics of the hopes we fondly nursed,\r\n  Not to the moments that have hurried by,\r\n   Whose joys and griefs are lived, the best, the worst.\r\n\r\n  Not to the Future, 'tis a realm where dwell\r\n    Fair, misty ghosts, which fade as we draw near,\r\n  Whose fair mirages coming hours dispel,\r\n    A land whose hopes find no fruition here.\r\n\r\n  But to the Present: be it dark or bright,\r\n    Stout-hearted greet it; turn its ill to good;\r\n  Throw on its clouds a soul-reflected light;\r\n    Its ills are blessings, rightly understood.\r\n\r\n  Prate not of failing hopes, of fading flowers;\r\n    Whine not in melancholy, plaintive lays,\r\n  Of joys departed, vanished sunny hours;\r\n    A cheerful heart turns every thing to praise.\r\n\r\n  Clouds can not always lower, the sun must shine;\r\n    Grief can not always last, joy's hour will come;\r\n  Seize as you may, each sunbeam, make it thine,\r\n    And make thy heart the sunshine's constant home.\r\n\r\n  Nor for thyself alone, a sunny smile\r\n    Carries a magic nothing can withstand;\r\n  A cheerful look may many a care beguile,\r\n    And to the weary be a helping hand.\r\n\r\n  Be brave--clasp thy great sorrows in thy arms;\r\n   Though eagle-like, they threat, with lifted crest,\r\n  The dread, the terror which thy soul alarms,\r\n   Shall turn a peaceful dove upon thy breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A STRANGE STORY--ITS SEQUEL._\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe often expressed wish of the American Press for an explanation of the\r\nmeaning of 'A Strange Story,' shall be complied with. It is purely and\r\nsimply this: Many novels, most of them, in fact, treat of the World; the\r\nrest may be divided into those vaguely attempting to describe the works\r\nof the Flesh and the Devil. This division of subjects is fatal to their\r\nforce; there was need to write a novel embracing them all; therefore 'A\r\nStrange Story' was penned. Mrs. Colonel Poyntz personated the World,\r\nDoctor Fenwick the Flesh, and Margrave, _alias_ Louis Grayle, certainly,\r\nI may be allowed to say, played the Devil with marked ability. To give a\r\nfitting _morale_ to all, the character of Lilian Ashleigh was thrown in;\r\nthe good genius, the conqueror of darkness, the positive of the\r\nelectrical battery meeting the negative and eliciting sparks of\r\ntriumphant light--such was the heroine.\r\n\r\nMan, conscious of a future life, and endowed with imagination, is not\r\ncontent with things material, especially if his brain is crowded with\r\nthe thoughts of the brains of ten thousand dead authors, and his nervous\r\nsystem is over-tasked and over-excited. In this condition he rushes\r\naway--away from cool, pure, and lovely feature--burying himself in the\r\nhot, spicy, and gorgeous dreams of Art. He would adore Cagliostro, while\r\nhe mocked Doctor Watts! Infatuated dreamer! Returning at last, by good\r\nchance--or, rather, let me say, by the directing hand of\r\nProvidence--from his evil search of things tabooed, to admiration of the\r\nReal, the Tangible, and the True; he will show himself as Doctor Fenwick\r\ndoes in this sequel, a strong, sensible, family-man, with a clear head\r\nand no-nonsense about him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n'I think,' said Faber, with a sigh, 'that I must leave Australia and go\r\nto other lands, where I can make more money. You remember when that\r\nEgyptian woman bore the last--positively the last--remains of Margrave,\r\nor Louis Grayle, to the vessel?'\r\n\r\n'I do,' quoth Doctor Fenwick.\r\n\r\n'Well, a pencil dropped from the pocket of the inanimate form. I picked\r\nit up, and on it was stamped in gilded letters:\r\n\r\n              'FABER, No. 4.'\r\n\r\nI believe it may belong to one of my family--lost, perhaps, in the ocean\r\nof commerce.'\r\n\r\n'Who knows? We will think of this anon; but hark! the tea-bell is rung;\r\nlet us enter the house.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n'Good gracious! Doctor Faber, I am so glad to see you. Sit right down in\r\nthis easy-chair. We've muffins for tea, and some preserves sent all the\r\nway from dear Old England. Now, Allen, be lively to-night, and show us\r\nhow that cold chicken should be carved.'\r\n\r\nThus Lilian, Doctor Fenwick's wife, rattled on. She had grown very stout\r\nin the five years passed since 'A Strange Story' was written, and now\r\nweighed full thirteen stone, was red-cheeked and merry as a cricket.\r\nMrs. Ashleigh, too, had grown very stout and red-cheeked, and was\r\nbustling around when the two doctors entered the room.\r\n\r\n'How much do you think I weigh?' asked Fenwick of Doctor Faber.\r\n\r\n'About fifteen stone,' answered the old doctor, while he dissected a\r\nside-bone of the chicken. 'I think you did well to begin farming in\r\nearnest. There is nothing like good hard work to cure the dyspepsia and\r\nromantic dreams.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, dear doctor, and you have reason, to be sure,' said Mrs.\r\nAshleigh. 'And pray, don't you think, now, that Lilian is a great deal\r\nmore comely since she has given up worsted-work and dawdling, and taken\r\nto filling her duties as housewife?'\r\n\r\n'To be sure I do.'\r\n\r\nThe doctor here passed the muffins to Lilian. She helped herself to a\r\nbrown one, remarking:\r\n\r\n'It is such a blessed thing to have a fine appetite, and be able to eat\r\nhalf-a-dozen muffins for tea! Oh! by the way, Allen, I wish you would\r\nbuy three or four more barrels of pale ale--we are nearly out.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n'Here ye are, gen-till-men! This fine de-tersive soap--on-ly thrippence\r\na tab-let--takes stains out of all kinds of things. Step up while there\r\nair a few tab-lets left of this in-im-a-table art-tickle unsold.'\r\n\r\n'Who's that guy in the soap-trade?' asked one policeman of another one\r\nas they passed along Lowther Arcade and saw the man whose conversation\r\nis reported above.\r\n\r\n'He's a deep one, hi know,' said the one asked. ''Is name is Grayle,\r\nLouis Grayle. There's hodd stories 'bout 'im, werry hodd. 'E tries to\r\nwork a werry wiry dodge on the johnny-raws, bout bein' ha 'undred hand\r\nten years hold. Says 'e's got some kind o' water wot kips hun' from\r\ngrowink hold, My heye! strikes me if 'e 'ad, 'e wouldn't bein' sellin'\r\nsoap 'bout 'ere. Go hup to 'im hand tell 'im to move hon, 'e's ben\r\nwurkin this lay long enough, I _ham_ thinkin'.\r\n\r\nSuch, gentle reader, was the condition of Louis Grayle when I last saw\r\nhim. By the assistance of confederates and other means, he had imposed\r\non our good friend Doctor Fenwick, in former years, and nearly driven\r\nthat poor gentleman crazy during his celibacy, especially as the doctor\r\nin all this period would smoke hasheesh and drink laudanum\r\ncocktails--two little facts neglected to be mentioned in 'A Strange\r\nStory.' Now, he was poor as a crow, this Louis Grayle, and was only too\r\nglad to turn the information he had learned of Haroun of Aleppo, to\r\nprofitable account--the most valuable knowledge he had gained from that\r\nOriental sage being the composition of a soap, good to erase stains from\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colonel Poyntz having rendered herself generally disagreeable to\r\neven the London world of fashion, by her commanding presence, has been\r\nquietly put aside, and at latest accounts, every thing else having\r\nfailed, had taken up fugitive American secessionists for subjects, and\r\nreports of revolvers and pokers (a slavish game of cards) were\r\ncirculated as filling the air she ruled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDoctor Fenwick is now the father of four small tow-headed children, who\r\nposs the long Australian days teasing a tame Kangaroo and stoning the\r\nloud-laughing great kingfisher and other birds, catalogue of which is\r\nmislaid. His wife has not had a single nervous attack for years, and\r\nprobably never will have another. Doctor Faber married Mrs. Ashleigh!\r\n\r\nDoctor Fenwick, it is needless to say, has thrown his library of\r\nAlchemists, Rosicrucianists, Mesmerists, Spiritualists,\r\nTranscendentalists, and all other trashy lists into the fire, together\r\nwith several pounds of bang, hasheesh, cocculus indicus, and opium. He\r\nat this present time of writing, is an active, industrious, intelligent,\r\nand practical man, finding in the truthful working out THE great\r\nproblem, Do unto others as you would have others do unto you, an\r\nexceeding great reward.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_WHAT THEN?_\r\n\r\nBY J.

Mr. Tilton wrote also a private letter to a friend, giving an\r\ninteresting reminiscence, which he did not mention in his published\r\naccount. The following is an extract from this letter, now first made\r\npublic:\r\n\r\n\r\n     As I was about parting from Mr. Irving, at the door-step, he held\r\n     my hand a few moments, and said:\r\n\r\n     'You know Henry Ward Beecher?'\r\n\r\n     'Yes,' I replied, 'he is an intimate friend.'\r\n\r\n     'I have never seen him,' said he, 'tell me how he looks.'\r\n\r\n     I described, in a few words, Mr. Beecher's personal appearance;\r\n     when Mr. Irving remarked:\r\n\r\n     'I take him to be a man always in fine health and cheery spirits.'\r\n\r\n     I replied that he was hale, vigorous, and full of life; that every\r\n     drop of his blood bubbled with good humor.\r\n\r\n     'His writings,' said Knickerbocker, 'are full of human kindness. I\r\n     think he must have a great power of enjoyment.'\r\n\r\n     'Yes,' I added, 'to hear him laugh is as if one had spilt over you\r\n     a pitcher of wine.'\r\n\r\n     'It is a good thing for a man to laugh well,' returned the old\r\n     gentleman, smiling. He then observed:\r\n\r\n     'I have read many of your friend's writings; he draws charming\r\n     pictures; he inspires and elevates one's mind; I wish I could once\r\n     take him by the hand.'\r\n\r\n     At which I instantly said:\r\n\r\n     'I will ask him to make you a visit.'\r\n\r\n     'Tell him I will give him a Scotch welcome; tell him that I love\r\n     him, though I never have seen his face.'\r\n\r\n     These words were spoken with such evident sincerity, that\r\n     Sunnyside will always have a sunnier place in my memory, because\r\n     of the old man's genial tribute to my dear friend.\r\n\r\n                                      I am ever yours,\r\n                                                THEODORE TILTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph from the _Boston Traveller,_ contains a few\r\nfacts well worth noting:\r\n\r\n     'The secession sympathizers in the North have two favorite dodges\r\n     for the service of their friends, the enemy. The first is, to\r\n     magnify the numbers of the rebel forces, placing them at 500,000\r\n     men, whereas they never have had above half as many men in the\r\n     field, all told, and counting negroes as well as white men. The\r\n     other is, to magnify the cost of the war on the side of the\r\n     Federalists. They tell us that our public war-debt, by the close of\r\n     the current fiscal year, June 30, 1862, will be $1,200,000,000,\r\n     (twelve hundred million dollars.) They know better than this, for\r\n     that debt will, at the date named, be not much above $620,000,000,\r\n     which would be no greater burden on the country than was that which\r\n     it owed in 1815, perhaps not so great a burden as that was. People\r\n     should not allow themselves to be frightened by the prophecies of\r\n     men who, if they could be sure of preserving slavery in all its\r\n     force, would care for nothing else.'\r\n\r\nIt is always easy to make up a gloomy statement, and this has been done\r\nof late to perfection by the demo-secessionists among us. It is an easy\r\nmatter to assume, as has been done, the maximum war expenditure for one\r\nsingle day, and say that it is the average. It is easy, too, to say that\r\n'You can never whip the South,' and point to Richmond 'bounce' in\r\nconfirmation. It will all avail nothing. Slavery is going--of _that_\r\nrest assured--and the South is to be thoroughly Northed with new blood.\r\n_Delenda est Dixie._\r\n\r\nOur 'private' readers in the army--of whom we have enough, we are proud\r\nto say, to constitute a pretty large-sized public--may rest assured that\r\naccounts will not be settled with the South without very serious\r\nconsideration of what is due to the soldier for his services 'in\r\nsnatching the common-weal from the jaws of hell,' as the Latin memorial\r\nto Pitt, on the Dedham stone hath it. It has been said that republics\r\nare ungrateful; but in this instance the adage must fall to the ground.\r\nThe soldier will be as much needed after the war, to settle the South,\r\n'North it,' and preserve the Union by his intellect and his industry, as\r\nhe now is to reestablish it by his bravery.\r\n\r\nWe find the following in the Boston _Courier_ of March 29th:\r\n\r\n     'Our attention has been called to a statement in the\r\n     _CONTINENTAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE_, to the effect, that certain\r\n     interesting 'Notes on the Gulf States,' which have recently\r\n     appeared in this paper were reproductions, with certain\r\n     alterations, of letters which were printed in the _Knickerbocker\r\n     Magazine_ several years ago. The statement made is not positive,\r\n     but made with such qualifications as might lead to the inference\r\n     that the comparison was not very carefully made. We can only\r\n     say, that we have had no opportunity to confer with our distant\r\n     correspondent, who handed us the whole series of 'Notes'\r\n     together, in manuscript, for publication; nor had we any reason\r\n     to believe that they were ever printed before, either in whole\r\n     or in part. We can say nothing further, until we know more about\r\n     the grounds for the intimation of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.'\r\n\r\nWe were guarded in our statement, not having at hand, when we wrote the\r\nparagraph referred to, more than three or four numbers of the Courier\r\ncontaining the Gulf States articles, and not desiring to give the\r\naccusation a needlessly harsh expression, knowing well that the best\r\ninformed editor may have at times old literary notes passed upon him for\r\nnew ones. What we _do_ say, is simply that several columns of the\r\narticles which appeared as original in the Boston _Courier,_ were\r\n_literal reprints_ from a series which appeared in the _Knickerbocker_\r\nMagazine in 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE OFFICIAL WAR MAP--NOW READY_\r\n\r\n_HAZARD'S_\r\n\r\n_RAILROAD AND MILITARY MAP OF THE SOUTHERN STATES_\r\n\r\nCompiled from the most authentic sources, and the United States Coast\r\nSurveys, by the Committee on Inland Transportation of the Board of Trade\r\nof Philadelphia, and superbly engraved in the finest style of map\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nThe information for this map was recently obtained by A PERSONAL TOUR\r\nTHROUGH THE SOUTH, as well as by the information given by THE PRESIDENT\r\nOF EVERY RAILROAD; the corrections make it COMPLETE TO THE PRESENT HOUR;\r\nand it gives so recent and such valuable facts concerning all the\r\nRailroads, that the War Department immediately authorized its\r\npublication, and distributed ONE THOUSAND COPIES among the Generals and\r\nColonels of the Army; that order having been supplied, no further delay\r\nin issuing the map will occur, and subscribers can now be supplied at\r\nthe following prices:\r\n\r\nIn Sheets, Carefully Colored,                                  $1.00\r\nIn Sheets, Carefully Colored, in a Neat Cloth Case,             1.50\r\nThe Same,  Carefully Colored, Mounted on Muslin, Folded,        2.50\r\n  Do.      Carefully Colored, on Rollers, Varnished,            2.50\r\n  Do.      Carefully Colored, Beautifully Mounted and\r\n                  Framed for Office Use,                        3.00\r\n\r\nSeveral weighty reasons for purchasing \"HAZARD'S RAILROAD AND\r\nMILITARY MAP OF THE SOUTHERN STATES.\"\r\n\r\n1st. It is the official map; and therefore must be the best and the most\r\nreliable, which is everything, particularly at this time when a good map\r\nis of such universal interest. This is the ONLY MAP that has been\r\nofficially adopted for Government purposes.\r\n\r\n2d. The Coast is so distinct and accurate, it shows every little island\r\nand inlet, and is as correct as the large maps issued by the Coast\r\nSurvey Office.\r\n\r\n3d. It is very cheap. It is thirty-two by fifty-five inches, and is one\r\nof the best specimens of map engraving ever done in this country.\r\n\r\n4th. It presents the whole Southern States at one view, and the\r\nrailroads are so distinctly marked as to show at a glance the most\r\nimportant strategical points.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MCCLELLAN has acknowledged in several communications the \"_great\r\nimportance to his movements of the accurate information in regard to the\r\nSouthern Railroads, conveyed in this map_.\"\r\n\r\nTestimonials of the same character have been received from Prof. A.D.\r\nBACHE, of the Coast Survey Department, as to the great accuracy of the\r\ncoast line; and _one hundred extra copies ordered \"to distribute among\r\nthe Commanders of the Atlantic and Gulf Squadrons,\"_ which have been\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nWhile ADOPTED FOR ITS ACCURACY by the MILITARY AUTHORITIES, as has been\r\nstated, it is yet more especially a COMMERCIAL MAP, and was at first\r\nintended expressly for that purpose. Hence, its value will be\r\nundiminished when the war is over, and renewed attention is directed to\r\nthat section.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said of THE GREAT VALUE OF THIS MAP TO EVERY\r\nINTELLIGENT MAN, is there any one who will be without it? particularly\r\nsince its price has been made as low as that of inferior maps, in order\r\nto keep up with the times. We are constantly told by those who already\r\nhave several of the maps rushed upon the public, that they have laid\r\nthem aside and use only this one.\r\n\r\nACCURACY AND DISTINCTNESS are the characteristics of this map, the only\r\none sanctioned by the Government.\r\n\r\nJust published and for sale by\r\n\r\nCHAS.

It was started at a period when\r\nany new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the\r\npublisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.\r\nFearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,\r\nfor the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has found favor in\r\nquarters where censure was expected, and patronage where opposition only\r\nwas looked for. While holding firmly to its _own opinions_, it has\r\nopened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS _of widely different views_, and\r\nhas made a feature of employing the literary labors of the _younger_\r\nrace of American writers. How much has been gained by thus giving,\r\npractically, the fullest freedom to the expression of opinion, and by\r\nthe infusion of fresh blood into literature, has been felt from month to\r\nmonth in its constantly increasing circulation.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE CONTINENTAL many of\r\nits political articles, and the result is, it has not given labored\r\nessays fit only for a place in ponderous encyclopedias, but fresh,\r\nvigorous, and practical contributions on men and things as they exist.\r\n\r\nIt will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a\r\nguarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant\r\ntalent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able\r\npolitical articles which have given it so much reputation will be\r\ncontinued in each issue, and in this number is commenced a new Serial by\r\nRichard D. Kimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents of\r\nWall-Street,' 'St. Leger,' etc., entitled,\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?_\r\n\r\nAn account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading\r\nmen in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the\r\nChurch, recounting what he did, and how he made his money. This work\r\nwhich will excel the previous brilliant productions of this author.\r\n\r\nThe UNION--The Union of ALL THE STATES--that indicates our politics. To\r\nbe content with no ground lower than the highest--that is the standard\r\nof our literary character.\r\n\r\nWe hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and\r\nall who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic\r\nliterature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is\r\nnot one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there\r\nis in every town in the loyal States some active person whose time might\r\nbe profitably employed in procuring subscribers to our work. To\r\nencourage such to act for us we offer the following very liberal\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\nTwo copies for one year,                  Five dollars.\r\nThree copies for one year,                Six dollars.\r\nSix copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\nEleven copies for one year,               Twenty dollars.\r\nTwenty copies for one year,               Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six Cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\nThree Dollars a year, IN ADVANCE.--_Postage paid, by the Publisher_.\r\n\r\nJ.R.
