Y. Weekly Despatch._]\r\n\r\nDuring the last three months Branch’s _Alligator_ has been the talk of\r\nthe town. Through the columns of his little sheet, Branch has made\r\ncharges of the most serious nature against prominent citizens and office\r\nholders. At first no notice was taken of these attacks, finally,\r\nhowever, these charges were so generally talked of that it became\r\nnecessary for the parties assailed to notice them. Mayor Tiemann, Simeon\r\nDraper and Supervisor Bell united in a complaint before the Grand Jury,\r\nwho found an indictment; whereupon all the rest of the individuals who\r\nhad been honored with the attentions of the _Alligator_ set to work to\r\naid in bringing Branch to justice. His case was set down for trial in\r\nthe sessions on Monday last. When the case was called, Branch announced\r\nhimself ready for trial; the District Attorney, however, said he would\r\nnot be ready till Tuesday. An attempt had been made on Saturday to\r\nprejudice the case by one of his bondsmen, being indused to surrender\r\nBranch, and on Tuesday, in the middle of the trial, Mr. Southworth, the\r\nother bondsman, went into Court and surrendered him. In both cases other\r\nparties came forward and took the places of these pretended friends. By\r\napplying the sharpest rules of legal practice, his testimony was ruled\r\nout and Branch was convicted, and without giving him time to breathe, he\r\nwas sentenced to pay a fine of $250 and to be imprisoned in the\r\nPenitentiary for one year. The Recorder in his remarks volunteered the\r\ngentle hint to the rest of the newspapers, that there were a number of\r\nother editors whom he meant to put through a similar course of sprouts.\r\nWhile we do not care to quarrel with the verdict of the jury, and\r\ncertainly do not wish to be understood as advocating the license of the\r\nPress to assail unjustly the character of any individual in the\r\ncommunity, we must say to the Recorder and the parties to the trial,\r\nthat we hardly think they will find any other case in which they will be\r\npermitted to put an editor through with quite such railroad speed,\r\nthough we admit that if justice were as promptly administered in all\r\ncases, the Court of Sessions would stand much higher in public\r\nestimation. Of the real merits of Branch’s case we have no means of\r\njudging. That he believed the truth of the charges he made we have not\r\nthe slightest doubt. If there was any falsehood in the matter, he was\r\nthe dupe of it and not the perpetrator, and we sincerely regret that the\r\nprosecutors saw fit to avail themselves of legal technicalities to shut\r\nout what his witnesses had to say. It is quite as unfortunate for them\r\nas it is for Branch. While their suppression consigns him to prison it\r\nleaves the prosecution open to invidious comments, all of which might\r\nhave been silenced by dragging the slanderers (if such they are) into\r\nthe light of day and refuting these calumnies. That, however, is their\r\nbusiness, not ours. In the meantime poor Branch has been consigned to\r\nthe tender mercies of the Ten Governors—one of whom, at least, has\r\npublicly announced his determination to “put him through the _roughest\r\ncourse of training_ any man ever got on the Island.” We were surprised\r\nto hear that the Governor in question had made this _heartless_ speech.\r\nWe supposed him to be a _Christian_ and a _man_, but we cannot reconcile\r\nthe idea of striking a fallen and powerless brother as either an\r\nevidence of _Christianity or manhood_, and we trust the Governor will\r\nyet see the impropriety of attempting to put his threat into execution.\r\nWe see by this morning’s _Express_, that Branch was on Friday seen in\r\nthe quarry with his hands all a mass of blisters, working away under a\r\nbroiling sun. This looks as though the Governors intend to give him the\r\nfull benefit of his sentence.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_ takes the occasion of Branch’s conviction to read us a\r\nlecture on the enormity of scurrility and libel. No other print in the\r\ncountry is so well qualified for the task. Bennett evidently thinks New\r\nYorkers have short memories, not to recollect the obscene and licentious\r\ncharacter of the _Herald_ in its earlier days. He has used Branch as\r\noften as any other paper in New York to abuse people towards whom he had\r\nincurred a hostility, but now he is down, Bennett kicks him with the\r\nrest. We perceive that George Wilkes has commenced a libel suit against\r\nBennett for what he said of _Porter’s Spirit_.\r\n\r\n[We have taken the liberty of _italicizing_ a portion of the above\r\narticle—_Ed. Alligator._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [_From the Sunday Times._]\r\n\r\nLIBEL CASE CHARACTERISTICS.—The conviction of Stephen H. Branch, before\r\nRecorder Barnard, on Wednesday, of a libel on Mayor Tiemann and two\r\nother public officers, naturally created a sensation. So did the remarks\r\nof the bench. Sentencing Mr. Branch to a year’s imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary and a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars, while such a\r\nman as Peter Dawson is subjected to incarceration for only sixty days,\r\nis not likely, however, to exert a wholesome effect upon the public\r\nmind. We have no doubt the recorder meant, by his severity, to make an\r\nexample of Branch, in order to deter other indiscreet men who are more\r\nled by their impulses than their judgment from indulging in similarly\r\nreprehensible publications: but we conceive that justice administered\r\nwith such rigidity, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, might\r\nseem to wear the aspect of persecution; and converting Branch into a\r\nmartyr, neither elevates the character of the court, nor wins the moral\r\nsympathy of public opinion. The general mind has really appropriated the\r\nidea that because Branch attacked so important a person as Mayor\r\nTiemann, the whole power of the corporation has been consolidated into\r\none grand vindictive effort to crush out the courageous but silly\r\nslanderer. Every one naturally murmurs, therefore, if this be so, who\r\nmay not be the next sacrifice? Common rumor does not hesitate to\r\ninsinuate that the character of the proceedings taken against Branch,\r\nand the peremptory treatment bestowed upon the counsel for the prisoner,\r\nwere the result of a preconcerted arrangement of the authorities. This\r\nassumption believed, who feels secure of justice should he be\r\nunfortunate enough to incur the enmity of a coalition so potential?\r\n\r\nMr. Branch’s libels were coarse, scandalous, and boldly reiterated. It\r\nwas difficult to believe them wholly foundationless, because an\r\ninvestigation was demanded with such persistent audacity. Branch openly\r\navowed his readiness to establish all his statements, however\r\ndefamatory; and although they criminated citizens whose good name we had\r\nalways been taught to esteem, they started our incredulity, and set\r\nevery thinking mind astir with painful distrust. We were glad,\r\ntherefore, to find a legitimate course adopted, and an appeal to the\r\nlaws made to decide the truth or falsity of the accusations.\r\n\r\nMr. Branch, as a libeller of the most extravagant kind, merited condign\r\npunishment; but, after all, it is very clear that Mr. Branch’s strange,\r\nwild, energetic, incoherent nature, has been made use of by somebody\r\nelse to accomplish his own purposes. Branch has been the catspaw of some\r\ndeeper and more sanely plotting intellect behind the curtain; and we\r\nregret that the Recorder considered it necessary to rule out the\r\ntestimony which might have introduced us to the principals in this\r\noffensive operation, instead of their harum-scarum instrument. It would\r\nhave been, as far as the libelled ones are concerned, much better to\r\nhave probed the whole affair to the bottom, even if the exact rule of\r\nevidence had been made to yield temporarily to the exigency. It would\r\nhave been better for them to let the public perceive precisely on what\r\nground all this edifice of mendacity had been constructed. It would have\r\nexhibited the confidence which belongs to conscious innocence. It would\r\nnot only have exposed the real wire-workers of this game of wholesale\r\ncalumniation, but, in demonstrating the integrity of the parties\r\nassailed, it would have left no unexplained mystery, no dubious point of\r\nfact, around which malice might still gather the shadowy wind-breath of\r\ncurrent scandal. If, however, they are satisfied, we ought to be. We are\r\nnot convinced that Randall’s Island is a paradise of official morality,\r\nand the great public would not credit us were we to hazard an assertion\r\nto that effect; but we _are_ satisfied that the particular charges made\r\nby Mr. Branch are untrue, though imposed upon him as truths, and we hope\r\nthat, having had their probity completely substantiated in the premises,\r\nthe gentlemen so recklessly accused by Mr. Branch are not disposed to be\r\nvindictive.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we must be permitted to say that we do not admire the\r\ntone of the Recorder’s remarks on passing sentence. It is the first time\r\nwe have had occasion to allude to this gentleman except in terms of\r\nmerited commendation. We entertain a high opinion of his general\r\nimpartiality. His promptitude, his disdain for pettifogger’s quibbling,\r\nhis nice sense of justice, and his freedom from those tainted\r\nassociations which rob the bench in some quarters of dignity and public\r\nconfidence, have all contributed to place him in the front rank of our\r\ncriminal magistracy. We do not impugn his integrity, therefore, but the\r\nquality of his judgment both in imposing so severe a sentence upon this\r\nweak and foolish victim of designing knaves, and in speaking of “other\r\nlibellers,” to all of whom he contemplates meting out a “similar\r\npunishment.” We know very well that he intended to threaten no\r\nrespectable press, or to hint at fetters _in terrorem_ upon its proper\r\nindependence—but his language may be easily misinterpreted; and when we\r\nconsider how liable the most prudent journalist is to daily imposition,\r\nthe observation that “this verdict settles the fact that no man can make\r\nan assertion in a newspaper without being liable to be punished\r\ncriminally, unless he can substantiate it,” seems to us one of\r\ngratuitous harshness, and in any body else would be called one of\r\npetulence and ill-humor. Branch’s excitement, however, had doubtless\r\ndisturbed the usual current of quiet feeling which characterizes the\r\nconduct of the Recorder, and we see the effect. The best of us are open\r\nto these influences, and we are not inclined to forget how much the\r\ncommunity owes to the general honesty and equity of Recorder Barnard, in\r\nour exceptions to what is, perhaps, but a hasty expression or so in the\r\npresent instance.\r\n\r\nConsidering that there are at least 10 or 12 suits for libel pending\r\nagainst the _Herald_, for gross and malicious libels upon sundry\r\nrespectable citizens, it is really refreshing to peruse its comments\r\nupon the warning given by Recorder Barnard in the Branch case, to\r\nlibellers generally. What the _Alligator_ IS, the _Herald_ WAS; and if\r\nthe latter has improved in decency in proportion as it has increased in\r\nresponsibility, necessity, not choice, lies at the bottom of the\r\nmetamorphosis. We are afraid that the Recorder’s hint was purposed, in\r\nfact, for the special edification of the _Herald_. And, notwithstanding\r\nthat journal’s sudden disposition to saponize _both_ the gentlemen on\r\nthe bench of the General Sessions, instead of its customary one, the\r\nRecorder may chance to give its responsible conductor a lesson of\r\nimpartiality he little expects by coercing him, despite his\r\nself-importance, to keep company with Mr. Branch, as a reward for some\r\nof his virulent assaults on private character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [_From the N. Y. Sunday Mercury._]\r\n\r\nBRANCH’S SENTENCE.—Quite unexpectedly the trial of Stephen H. Branch,\r\nfor libel against Mayor Tiemann, Simeon Draper and Isaac Bell, was\r\nbrought up and dispatched, during the past week, with a velocity which\r\nwould make the most wholesome impression, were the rest of the District\r\nAttorney’s calendar put through with equal promptness and exemplary\r\neffect. Branch was found guilty, and sentenced to one year’s\r\nimprisonment on Blackwell’s Island, and two hundred and fifty dollars\r\nfine. The _Tribune_, in alluding to this sentence of Branch by Recorder\r\nBarnard, says:\r\n\r\n“Considering that the libel, however groundless essentially, appears to\r\nhave had a real foundation in statements made to Branch by persons whom\r\nhe undoubtedly believed, and whom his counsel had ready to produce (but\r\ntheir testimony was not allowed), we must consider this sentence a\r\nsevere one. We believe it will excite for him a sympathy which it is\r\nunwise to provoke. Branch, we believe, has been trying pretty hard to\r\nlibel _us_ in his abusive little sheet; but we have never considered his\r\nslanders worth any sort of notice. It may be well to stop his career,\r\nbut not to make him a martyr. And we say most decidedly, that\r\nconsidering the libel for which he was indicted was really based on\r\ninformation furnished him by persons whom he had reason to believe, we\r\ndeem his sentence a harsh one, and trust it may be mitigated by pardon.”\r\n\r\nBy the press generally, the matter is regarded pretty much in the same\r\ntemper, excepting the anomalous instance of the _Herald_! That\r\nimmaculate sheet takes occasion to give utterance to any extent of wrath\r\nand indignation against Branch and his _Alligator_, and\r\ncharacteristically against such of its cotemporaries, present and past,\r\nas it would desire to denounce and stigmatise, with an odor which has by\r\nno means been washed from its own bedraggled garments. Indeed, as the\r\ndirect object of the _Herald_ would appear to be a malicious fling at\r\nthe _Spirit of the Times_ in view of another case on the Recorder’s\r\ndocket—that of Judge Russell’s indictment—so the _Herald_ lays itself\r\nliable to another indictment, which has been duly entered against\r\nBennett for no less than twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald’s_ fulminations, and the political pressure brought to bear\r\nupon Branch by his prosecutors must inevitably have the effect of\r\nexciting a warm public sympathy for their object. Such, indeed, is the\r\nmanner in which the infliction of the full penalty of the statute is\r\nregarded in this case, that the prosecutors themselves will be forced to\r\nstep in as petitioners for a pardon, or incur no little odium in the\r\nbusiness. Besides, what is very sensibly remarked by the _Tribune_, as\r\nto the foundation of Branch’s charges, it might be added that the public\r\nhave no means of judging whether those charges are well founded or not.\r\nBy a course of proceedings altogether extraordinary on the part of the\r\nprosecution, the apparent real evidence in the case was completely\r\nexcluded, and Branch convicted solely upon the oaths of his prosecutors,\r\nwithout an actual investigation of the presumed issue on which the libel\r\noriginated. The public are largely exercised on the matter, and inquiry\r\nis particularly active as to who the “Matron” really is? Why she was not\r\nput upon the stand, and what she could have to say for herself? How\r\nwould her previous character have justified her taking the stand as a\r\nwitness, or of holding the position she has occupied under the chief\r\nmagistrate? These points are matters of curious comment among the\r\npeople, necessarily provoked by the seemingly harsh and rough-shod\r\nprocedure in the case. It is to be regretted the matter was not fully\r\ncleared up by the production of the entire evidence.\r\n\r\nHOW BRANCH CONFRONTS HIS FATE.—The renowned tamer of alligators—I may as\r\nwell add, _en passant_—was duly surrendered to Warden Finch on Thursday,\r\nhaving been escorted hither to his prison by a little host of friends,\r\nwhose temper indicated no disposition to desert him. Sympathy is\r\nstrongly in his favor, on the ground, of course, that, whatever may be\r\nthought of his offence, his treatment at the hands of the officials and\r\nlawyers, has been such as only a weak and comparatively friendless man\r\nlike him would meet. You will soon see his prosecutors forced to sue for\r\nhis deliverance, just as eagerly as they have pressed for his\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nBesides the sensation created here, it has been noticeable that a\r\ngeneral scattering—“on leave”—of certain subordinates, has taken place\r\nduring the late “inquest.” It is doubtful if Stephen will, even here,\r\nhave a chance to confront the mysterious “matron.” The fright of the\r\ntrial being apparently over, the fugitives from the Alms-House will\r\ndoubtless return forthwith. Under the discipline of these precincts they\r\nwill find their best protection, as well from the impertinence of\r\ncross-examining lawyers, as from the no less stringent inquiries of a\r\nkeen public curiosity, mainly aroused by the suppression of the inside\r\ntestimony which could be found here. The nature and source of this I\r\nhave already pointed out. Should the motion in arrest of judgment reopen\r\nthe trial, it will doubtless be for the admission of the main evidence\r\nin the case, so mysteriously and adroitly evaded by the prosecution.\r\nThen only can the provoking rumors, now so general, be set at rest, or\r\nsatisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Branch here, it appears, will be in no degree lenient, as\r\nthere is more than one petty tyrant under the vice royalty who seems\r\ndesirous of venting his spleen upon the unfortunate man. He has taken\r\nhis place, it appears, already, by direction of the keepers, beside the\r\ncommon fellows in the quarries. The directions of one of the Governors\r\nis quoted to the effect that he would be “put through the roughest\r\ncourse of training any man ever got on the Island.” I have purposely\r\nwithheld a variety of matters in connection with these precincts this\r\nweek, until the interests with Stephen, with regard to the Ten\r\nGovernors, is more definitively settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                  New York, Saturday, August 21, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be one thing more than another on which we had fully made up\r\nour minds it is this: that our country is pre-eminently free—yea, the\r\nfreest in the whole family of nations. But the history of the past week\r\nhas taught us how very easily it is to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Stephen H. Branch in our Court of Sessions, a few days ago,\r\nteaches us a lesson which we ought not soon to forget. From the time\r\nthat our great nabob, Mayor Tiemann, associated with the Peter Cooper\r\n_guild_, first made their complaint, or “Trinity” of complaints, down to\r\nthe passing of the sentence in the Court of Sessions, the trial was one\r\nof the most vindictive and one-sided affair, on the part of the\r\nprosecution, that we recollect during our sojourn on this “miserable\r\nglobe.”\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it was proved on the trial that one of the\r\ncomplainants, or more properly _persecutors_, had never been before the\r\nGrand Jury. In the second place, it would appear that indictments by the\r\ndozen must have been preferred against the accused; for if we recollect\r\naright, he was arrested every day for nearly a fortnight, previous to\r\nhis trial. And again we have been told—how far it is true we care not to\r\ninquire—that one man who professed great friendship for him, and became\r\nhis bail on the last arrest, two days before his trial, on the following\r\nday withdrew his bail, and delivered the unfortunate man up to his\r\nadversaries; and in consequence of this latter act realised a contract\r\nfrom the city authorities. “Save us from our friends.”\r\n\r\nIf all this be true, it is one of the most arrant pieces of villany ever\r\nrecorded of Christian men.\r\n\r\nWhen we come into court we, unfortunately, if possible, find things\r\nworse. The ruling of the Judge was altogether too strict—too severe—in\r\nfact too arbitrary. The Judge, it appears to us, made it a point of his\r\nbusiness to shield, as much as possible, the complainants on the one\r\nhand, by interfering in behalf of the Mayor, when he was being\r\ncross-questioned by defendant’s Counsel; whilst on the other hand he\r\nruled out the principal evidence in support of the defendant, and of\r\ncourse deprived the accused of the slightest shadow of a chance to\r\nestablish his innocence.\r\n\r\nThen comes the Recorder’s charge to the Jury. And that we think is in\r\nkeeping; or, perhaps, we ought to say an improvement on the spirit of\r\nthe whole proceedings. Let any one sit down and read that charge calmly\r\nand dispassionately, and we venture to assert that for severity the\r\nreader cannot find a case to surpass it, nor perhaps even to equal it in\r\nthe history of modern English jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThen, if we consider the hurried manner in which the prosecution got up\r\nthis trial, and their mode of conducting it, as described above, we must\r\nconsider the proceedings unwarranted by the premises; and forms a great\r\ncontrast to the tardy manner in which our Courts mete out their\r\ninfinitismal doses of punishment to Thieves, Burglars, Murderers and\r\nDesperadoes.\r\n\r\nThere is still another charge, which in our opinion is the gravest of\r\nall. After the rendition of the verdict the counsel for the defence\r\nmoved a stay of proceedings; now mark the reply of his honor. _That he\r\nhad yesterday considered the possibility of such an application, and\r\nhad_ THEN MADE UP HIS MIND _that it could not be granted_. So from this\r\nit would appear, that the whole affair was settled before the parties\r\ncame into court; and so far as the trial goes, it was simply a\r\ncollateral incident of the proceedings, and not at all an operation for\r\nattaining the great end of justice.\r\n\r\nNow, we do not say a word as to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Branch. He\r\nmay be guilty—he may be innocent; we are just as far, if not farther,\r\nfrom that point than we were a month ago; and this is the ground of our\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nIf such proceedings be allowed permanently to obtain in our courts of\r\njustice, then we say that “trial by jury becomes a mockery, a delusion,\r\nand a snare.”\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AN IMMORTAL PETITION.\r\n\r\n_The Wise Peter Cooper, and his most extraordinary proposal of a Tank on\r\n   the summit of the City Hall, for the extinguishment of disastrous\r\n                            conflagrations._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           [Document No. 13.]\r\n\r\n                                                  BOARD OF ALDERMEN, }\r\n                                                   February 6, 1854. }\r\n\r\nThe following petition of Peter Cooper, in relation to the prevention\r\nand extinguishing of fire, and to give greater efficiency to the Police\r\nDepartment, was received and laid on the table and ordered to be\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n                                                    D. T.

By this arrangement it is safe to calculate that the\r\npresent Fire Department will be relieved from something like three\r\nquarters of the duties they are now called upon to perform. As an\r\nequivalent for this relief, I propose that the Fire Department shall\r\nbecome the guard of honor for our city, to be called out as firemen or\r\nsoldiers whenever their services are required by the proper authorities\r\nof our city. This arrangement proposes to continue the present Fire\r\nDepartment with every privilege they now enjoy, and relieve them from\r\nmore than half the labors they are now required to perform.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by your subscriber, that the plan proposed will make the\r\nFire Department and also the present active Police Department, the most\r\nuseful and honorable bodies of men in our city. The hearty co-operation\r\nof the members of the Fire Department, and also the members of the\r\nPolice to secure for our city the blessings which must naturally result\r\nfrom this arrangement, will entitle them not only to the pecuniary\r\nadvantages that must result to themselves and their families, but to the\r\nlasting gratitude and respect of every worthy inhabitant of our city.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the insurance companies of this city have\r\nnow in their employ eighty (80) men, at an expense of thirty (30)\r\nthousand dollars a year, to watch against fires. I am informed that they\r\nintend greatly to increase this force; in addition, your subscriber,\r\nwith a great number of merchants and private families, have for years\r\nconstantly employed private watchmen, to guard our stores and watch our\r\ndwellings from robbery and fires. All that these cost, and more, would\r\nbe gladly contributed to a body of police who would, by a faithful\r\nperformance of duty, secure the necessary relief for our Fire\r\ndepartment, by lessening annually the number of fires, and also by\r\nreducing the amount of property stolen below the average agreed upon.\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty to invite the attention of your honorable body\r\nto an ARRANGEMENT AND PRINCIPLE by which a large majority of all the\r\nofficers in the employ of the city will become pecuniarily and otherwise\r\ninterested in a faithful performance of their duty. Such performance\r\nwill not only secure to them the large fund provided by the Corporation,\r\nand in addition the fund to be recovered from the insurance companies,\r\nas a reward for reducing the loss by fire below the average agreed upon,\r\nbut they would, in addition, find the faithful performance of duty the\r\nsurest relief from excessive labor, by diminishing the number of fires\r\nand the amount of crime that now form so great and so unpleasant a part\r\nof their present labor.\r\n\r\nThe principal idea in the foregoing communication, was presented by your\r\nsubscriber to a previous Common Council, some twelve years since, under\r\na full sense of the great advantages that would result by saving\r\nmillions of property annually from destruction, and what is of more\r\nvalue, it would save the health and morals of thousands of the best and\r\nmost enthusiastic young men of our city from being broken down and\r\ndestroyed by their loss of time and the excessive labor occasioned by\r\nthe numerous fires that take place, and which would mainly be prevented\r\nby adopting the arrangement proposed.\r\n\r\n                            All of which is most respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                       Yours, with great respect,\r\n                                                         PETER COOPER.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have no doubt that by this time it is pretty generally understood,\r\nthat we have an engagement to fulfil, with the co-operation which, for\r\nthe present, requires our almost constant attentions.

We also indulge\r\nin the hope that in our Geological researches among the islands of the\r\nsea, that we shall make some valuable discoveries which will be of use\r\nto the inhabitants of the earth, and to the dwellers in Gotham in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAPITAL HOAX.—Some men plagiarise the thoughts of others, without\r\nbeing at all aware of the pungency of the fact as regards themselves.\r\nThe _Herald_, in alluding to a few of the “minor press,” gotten up and\r\n“spiced” precisely as the _Herald_ itself originally was, when it first\r\nattracted public attention, remarked: “These fellows must be taught that\r\nthey cannot use the liberty of the press so far as to make it the\r\nvehicle of their dirty thoughts and dirtier expressions, and that an\r\nhonorable profession is not to be degraded because they hang upon its\r\nskirts, like foul birds hovering over their prey.” The beauty of it is,\r\nthis extract is, word for word, the language employed by the _Courier\r\nand Enquirer_, in March, 1842, in relation to the _Herald_\r\nitself!—_Mercury._\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FRANK LESLIE AGAIN ARRESTED.\r\n\r\n                        RICH SCENE AT THE TOMBS!\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [_From the Sunday Times._]\r\n\r\nFrank Leslie was again arrested yesterday morning, on complaint of\r\nAldermen Reed and Tuomy. The officer told Mr. Leslie that his orders\r\nwere imperative to take him at once before Justice Osborne at the Tombs,\r\nwithout allowing him to send for counsel or seek for bail. On arriving\r\nat the Tombs, they were met by Aldermen Tuomy and Reed, accompanied by\r\nMr. John Graham, their counsel. Justice Osborne asked Mr. Leslie if he\r\ndemanded an examination. Mr. Leslie stated that he had not been allowed\r\ntime to send for his counsel, and did not know what course to pursue.\r\nJustice Osborne said he could have time to send for counsel and for\r\nbail.\r\n\r\nMr. Graham then produced the complaints. That of Alderman Reed set forth\r\nthat Mr. Leslie had published a picture representing him in the garb of\r\na butcher, with a party of Irishmen driving a miserable and\r\ndiseased-looking cow, without tail or horns, up to his stall. The leader\r\nof the party, Mr. Mike O’Flannagan, is represented as saying: “I read\r\nyou tould the aldermen t’other day that swill-fed beef was worth half a\r\ncent a pound more than any other kind of meat. Here’s a beauty, yer\r\nhonor; doesn’t he look fat and luscious? Arrah! don’t yer eyes wather to\r\nlook at it?—Here’s the baste; we’ve brought it on purpose fer yez. Hand\r\nus over the dimes!”\r\n\r\nAlderman Reed is represented as saying:—“I don’t deal in that kind of\r\nbeef. I stated that as an alderman, not as a butcher.”\r\n\r\nAld. Tuomy makes two complaints against Mr. Leslie. In the first one\r\nAld. Tuomy is represented as a ranting, roaring Irishman on board the\r\nEricsson, with a bottle of whisky in one hand and a shillelah in the\r\nother, saying—“If I catch the “Tribune” reporter I’ll throw him\r\noverboard, G—d d—n him.” The second one embraces an alleged libellous\r\narticle, and a caricature of Aldermen Tuomy and Reed, in which their\r\nnasal peculiarities are most outrageously magnified. Mr. Graham stated\r\nto the court that he desired to compel Leslie to give $2,500 bail in\r\neach case; in the two former instances, to keep the peace for twelve\r\nmonths, and abstain from publishing any more caricatures; and in the\r\nthird case to answer criminally to the Sessions. Mr. Graham proceeded to\r\nsay, that they intended to show these English scoundrels that they could\r\nnot libel and caricature respectable citizens with impunity.\r\n\r\nMr. Leslie said—“You had better keep cool, Mr. Graham.”\r\n\r\nMr. Graham, who was evidently very much excited, jumped up and\r\nsaid—“Don’t speak to me, you scoundrel, or I shall not be answerable for\r\nthe consequences. I ask your Honor to note that this is an attempt to\r\nintimidate respectable counsel. These fellows intend to caricature the\r\nwhole court. I’ll neck the first man I see take out a pencil. [At this\r\njuncture our reporter took out his pencil and began to take notes.] The\r\nfirst acquaintance I ever had with him showed him (pointing to Leslie)\r\nto be a d—d scoundrel. If they will meet me on any flat in New York\r\n(pointing to Leslie and his friend Watson), I’ll take the heads off both\r\nof them. I’ll show them by the swelling of their chops there’s no Miss\r\nNancyism about me” [shaking his fist in their faces].\r\n\r\nMr. LESLIE—“We are gentlemen—we are no pugilists, Mr. Graham.”\r\n\r\nMr. Graham.—“You are a G—d d—d English thief. I can lick the pair of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nJudge Osborne.—“Mr. Graham, you must stop this, as I can’t allow it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Graham.—“Within the past seventy-two hours he has sent a shaft to\r\nthe heart of the only remaining parent I have on earth, and the other\r\nnight I went down alone past his establishment, intending if I met him\r\non the curb to whip him like a dog.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leslie asked if the court intended to allow such procedings to\r\ncontinue. They were gentlemen, and not blackguards.\r\n\r\nAld. Reed.—“If they are gentlemen, one has sailed under an alias for the\r\npast five years.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leslie.—“That is not true.”\r\n\r\nJustice Osborne.—“Gentlemen, you must stop this.”\r\n\r\nMr. Graham.—“The only question is, are two gentlemen to be constantly\r\nlibelled by these English transports? They contaminate the air. If I\r\nstay in the room with them much longer, I shall suffocate. [Pointing to\r\nthem.]. See what mean-looking English thieves they are!”\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a gentleman, who we believe is Mr. Leslie’s printer,\r\ngot up and told Mr. Graham that he must not speak to him in that way.\r\nThis style of conversation continued some time longer, but did not lead\r\nto any breach of the peace, although it was evident that Mr. Graham\r\nneeded but a very small provocation to make him take off his coat and\r\n“go in.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leslie gave the required bail to keep the peace, justifying himself,\r\nin $5,000, and two sureties of $2,500 each. Messrs. Sam S. Sherwood and\r\nAlexander Douglass became his bail.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit.—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!

The Inspectors of Election in each town, ward, and election\r\ndistrict in this State, at the annual election to be held in November\r\nnext, shall provide a proper box to receive the ballots of the citizens\r\nof this State entitled to vote for members of the Legislature at such\r\nelection. On such ballot shall be written or printed, or partly written\r\nand printed, by those voters who are in favor of a Convention, the\r\nwords: “Shall there be a Convention to Revise the Constitution and amend\r\nthe same? Yes.” And by those voters who are opposed thereto, the words:\r\n“Shall there be a Convention to Revise the Constitution and amend the\r\nsame? No.” And all citizens entitled to vote as aforesaid shall be\r\nallowed to vote by ballot as aforesaid, in the election district in\r\nwhich he resides, and not elsewhere.\r\n\r\n§2. So much of the articles one, two and three, of title four, of\r\nchapter one hundred and thirty, of an act entitled “An act respecting\r\nelections other than for militia and town officer,” passed April fifth,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-two, and the acts amending the same, as\r\nregulates the manner of conducting elections and challenges, oaths to be\r\nadministered, and inquiries to be made, of persons offering to vote,\r\nshall be deemed applicable to the votes to be given or offered under the\r\nact: and the manner of voting and challenges, and the penalties for\r\nfalse swearing, prescribed by law, are hereby declared in full force and\r\neffect in voting or offering to vote under this act.\r\n\r\n§3.
