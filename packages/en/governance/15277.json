Any work undertaken on such lines commends itself\r\nto a ready welcome and a careful study, and I feel sure that both await\r\nMr Kettle's latest contribution to the literature of the Irish question.\r\nAs the son of one of the founders of the Land League, and as, for some\r\nyears, one of the most brilliant members of the Irish Party, and, later,\r\nProfessor in the School of Economics in the new National University in\r\nDublin, he has won his way to recognition as an eloquent exponent of\r\nIrish national ideas; whilst the novelty of his point of view, and the\r\nfreshness, vigour, and picturesque attractiveness of his style ensure\r\nfor his work a cordial reception on its literary merits, apart from its\r\npolitical value.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, one of the main sources of the Anglo-Irish difficulty has\r\nbeen mutual misunderstanding, generating mutual mistrust and hatred. But\r\nthe root of the difficulty goes deeper. It is to be sought in the system\r\nof misgovernment and oppression which successive generations of British\r\nrulers have imposed upon what, with cruel irony, British historians and\r\nstatesmen have been wont to call \"the sister country.\" This is the real\r\n\"open secret\" of Ireland, a secret that all who run may read, and the\r\neffective bearing of which is: that tyranny begets hatred, and that\r\nfreedom and justice are the only sure foundations of contentment and\r\ngoodwill between nations.\r\n\r\nDuring the past thirty years, and especially since 1886, when Mr\r\nGladstone threw the weight of his unrivalled genius and influence into\r\nthe scale in favour of justice to Ireland, a great deal has been done to\r\nerase the bitter memories of the past, and to enable the English and the\r\nIrish peoples to regard each other in the light of truth, and with a\r\nmore just appreciation of what is essential to the establishment of\r\ngenuine and lasting friendly relations between them.\r\n\r\nBut it would be idle to ignore the fact that, to a considerable section\r\nof the English people, Ireland is still a country of which they possess\r\nless knowledge than they do of the most insignificant and remote of the\r\nmany islands over which the British flag floats. Mr Kettle's book ought\r\nto be of service in dispelling this ignorance, and in enabling\r\nEnglishmen to view the Anglo-Irish question from the standpoint of an\r\neducated and friendly Irish opinion.\r\n\r\nThe output of purely political literature on the Irish problem has been\r\nincreasing during the past few years, and there is room for a book which\r\naims at focussing attention upon some aspects of it which the mere\r\npolitician is apt to pass lightly over or to ignore altogether. Like\r\nmost of Mr Kettle's work, the book bears the impress of his\r\nindividuality, and, to many of his readers, this will constitute much of\r\nits charm and merit. At the same time, in order to prevent\r\nmisunderstanding, it is necessary for me to state that I do not commit\r\nmyself to acceptance or endorsement of everything which the book\r\ncontains. I content myself with stating, from personal experience, that\r\nnothing which Mr Kettle writes about Ireland can fail to be worthy of\r\nnotice by everyone interested in the Home Rule controversy, and that I\r\nbelieve the circulation of this volume will serve to stimulate thought\r\nabout Ireland, and so to hasten the advent of that brighter day when the\r\ngrant of full self-government to Ireland will reveal to England the open\r\nsecret of making Ireland her friend and helpmate, the brightest jewel in\r\nher crown of Empire.\r\n\r\nJ. E. REDMOND.\r\n\r\n_12th December, 1911_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an intermission of nearly twenty years Ireland once again blocks\r\nthe way. \"Finally rejected\" by the House of Commons and the English\r\nelectorate in 1886, \"finally rejected\" by the House of Lords in 1893,\r\nthe Home Rule idea has not only survived but waxed stronger in the\r\nwilderness. Time and events have altered its shape only to clothe it\r\nwith a richer significance.\r\n\r\nWill Great Britain decide wisely in the choice to which she is now put?\r\nNaturally, I do not speak of the Parliamentary future of the Home Rule\r\nBill: that is safe. I have in mind rather that profound moral\r\nsettlement, that generous reconciliation which we have seen in South\r\nAfrica, and desire to see in Ireland. What of it? Did reason and the\r\ncandid vision of things, as they are, control public affairs, there\r\ncould be little doubt as to the issue in this choice between friendship\r\nand hatred, between the formula of freedom and that of domination. But,\r\nunhappily, we have no assurance that Philip sober rather than Philip\r\ndrunk will sign the warrant. There exists in England, in respect of all\r\nthings Irish, a monstrous residuum of prejudice. It lies ambushed in the\r\nblood even when it has been dismissed from the mind, and constitutes the\r\nreal peril of the situation. No effort will be spared to reawaken it.\r\nThe motto of militant Unionism has always been: When in doubt throw mud.\r\nSuch a programme naturally begets a predilection for ditches, and when\r\ncertain orators speak of the \"last ditch\" they must be taken to mean\r\nthat which has most mud in it. The old methods are already once more in\r\noperation. The wicked lying of previous campaigns no doubt cannot be\r\nrepeated: bigotry will make no further experiments in Pigottry. But a\r\nresolute attempt, lavishly financed and directed by masters of the art\r\nof defamation, will be made to blacken Ireland. Every newspaper in every\r\nremotest country-town in England will be deluged with syndicated venom.\r\nThe shop-keeper will wrap up his parcels in Orange posters, and the\r\nworking-man will, I hope, light his pipe for years to come with\r\npamphlets of the same clamant colour. Irishmen, or at all events persons\r\nborn in Ireland, will be found to testify that they belong to a\r\nbarbarous people which has never ceased from barbarism, and that they\r\nare not fit to govern themselves. Politicians who were never known to\r\nrisk a five-pound note in helping to develop Ireland will toss down\r\ntheir fifties to help to defame her. Such is the outlook. Against this\r\ncampaign of malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness it is the duty of\r\nevery good citizen to say his word, and in the following pages I say\r\nmine. This little book is not a compendium of facts, and so does not\r\ntrench on the province of Mr Stephen Gwynn M.P.'s admirable \"Case for\r\nHome Rule.\" It does not discuss the details, financial or otherwise, of\r\na statesmanlike settlement. Such suggestions as I had to make I have\r\nalready made in \"Home Rule Finance,\" and the reader will find much\r\nampler treatment of the whole subject in \"The Framework of Home Rule,\"\r\nby Mr Erskine Childers, and \"Home Rule Problems,\" edited by Mr Basil\r\nWilliams. In general, my aim has been to aid in humanising the Irish\r\nQuestion. The interpretation of various aspects of it, here offered, is\r\nintended to be not exhaustive but provocative, a mere set of shorthand\r\nrubrics any one of which might have been expanded into a chapter.\r\nAddressing the English reader with complete candour, I have attempted to\r\nrecommend to him that method of approach, that mental attitude which\r\nalone can divest him of his preconceptions, and put him in rapport with\r\nthe true spirit of the Ireland of actuality. To that end the various\r\nlines of discussion converge:--\r\n\r\nChapter I is an outline of the pathology of the English mind in Ireland.\r\n\r\nChapters II and III present the history of Ireland as the epic, not of a\r\nfutile and defeated, but of an indomitable and victorious people.\r\n\r\nChapter IV exhibits the Home Rule idea as a fundamental law of nature,\r\nhuman nature, and government.\r\n\r\nChapters V and VI contain a very brief account of the more obvious\r\neconomic crimes and blunders of Unionism.\r\n\r\nChapter VII discusses the queer ideas of \"Ulster,\" and the queer\r\nreasons for the survival of these ideas.\r\n\r\nChapter VIII demonstrates that, as a mere matter of political technique,\r\nHome Rule must be conceded if any real government is ever to exist\r\nagain, whether in Great Britain, in Ireland, or in the Empire.\r\n\r\nChapter IX dips into the future, and indicates that a Home Rule Ireland\r\nwill have so much interesting work to do as to have no time for civil\r\nwar or religious oppression.\r\n\r\nChapter X shows that everybody who values \"loyalty\" must of necessity be\r\na Home Ruler.\r\n\r\nThe only moral commended to the reader is that expressed by Browning in\r\na firm and inevitable line, which has been disastrously forgotten in so\r\nmany passages of English history:--\r\n\r\n     \"It's fitter being sane than mad.\"\r\n\r\nI have tried also to convey to him, with what success others must judge,\r\nsomething of the \"pride and passion\" of Irish nationality. That is, in\r\ntruth, the dream that comes through the multitude of business. If you\r\nthink that Home Rule is a little thing which must be done in a little\r\nway for little reasons, your feet are set on the path to failure. Home\r\nRule is one of those fundamental reforms that are not achieved at all\r\nunless they are achieved greatly.\r\n\r\nT.M.K.\r\n\r\n_December, 1911_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN SECRET OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nAN EXERCISE IN HUMILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand Ireland we must begin by understanding England.\r\nOn no other terms will that complex of facts, memories, and passions,\r\nwhich is called the Irish Question, yield up its secret. \"You have\r\nalways been,\" said a Lady Clanricarde to some English politician, \"like\r\na high wall standing between us and the sun.\" The phrase lives. It\r\nreveals in a flashlight of genius the historical relations of the two\r\nnations. It explains and justifies the principle adopted as the basis of\r\nthis discussion, namely, that no examination of the Irish Problem is\r\npossible without a prior examination of the English mind. It used to be\r\nsaid that England dearly loved a Lord, a dictum which may have to be\r\nmodified in the light of recent events. Far more than a Lord does the\r\ntypical Englishman love a Judge, and the thought of acting as a Judge.\r\nConfronted with Ireland he says to himself: \"Here are these Irish\r\npeople; some maintain that they are nice, others that they are nasty,\r\nbut everybody agrees that they are queer. Very good. I will study them\r\nin a judicial spirit; I will weigh the evidence dispassionately, and\r\ngive my decision. When it comes to action, I will play the honest broker\r\nbetween their contending parties.\" Now this may be a very agreeable way\r\nof going about the business, but it is fatally unreal. Great Britain\r\ncomes into court, she will be pained to hear, not as Judge but rather as\r\ndefendant. She comes to answer the charge that, having seized Ireland as\r\na \"trustee of civilisation,\" she has, either through incompetence or\r\nthrough dishonesty, betrayed her trust. We have a habit, in everyday\r\nlife, of excusing the eccentricities of a friend or an enemy by the\r\nreflection that he is, after all, as God made him. Ireland is\r\npolitically as Great Britain made her. Since the twelfth century, that\r\nis to say for a great part of the Middle Ages and for the whole of the\r\nmodern period, the mind of England and not that of Ireland has been the\r\ndominant fact in Irish history.\r\n\r\nThis state of things--a paradox in action--carries with it certain\r\nmetaphysical implications. The philosophers tell us that all morality\r\ncentres in the maxim that others are to be treated as ends in\r\nthemselves, and not as instruments to our ends. If they are right, then\r\nwe must picture Ireland as the victim of a radical immoralism. We must\r\nthink of her as a personality violated in its ideals, and arrested in\r\nits development. And, indeed, that is no bad way of thinking: it is the\r\none formula which summarises the whole of her experience. But the\r\nphrasing is perhaps too high and absolute; and the decline and fall of\r\nMr Balfour are a terrible example to those of us who, being young, might\r\notherwise take metaphysics too solemnly. It will, therefore, at this\r\nstage be enough to repeat that, in contemplating the discontent and\r\nunrest which constitute the Irish difficulty, Great Britain is\r\ncontemplating the work of her own hands, the creation of her own mind.\r\nFor that reason we can make no progress until we ascertain what sort of\r\nmind we have to deal with.\r\n\r\nI do not disguise from myself the extremely unpleasant nature of this\r\ninquiry. It is as if a counsel were to open his address by saying:\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Jury, before discussing the facts of the case I will\r\nexamine briefly the mental flaws, gaps, kinks, and distortions of you\r\ntwelve gentlemen.\" There is, however, this difference. In the analysis\r\nupon which we are engaged the mental attitude of the jury is not merely\r\na fact in the case, it is the whole case. Let me reinforce my weaker\r\nappeal by a passage from the wisest pen in contemporary English letters,\r\nthat of Mr Chesterton. There is in his mere sanity a touch of magic so\r\npotent that, although incapable of dullness, he has achieved authority,\r\nand although convinced that faith is more romantic than doubt, or even\r\nsin, he has got himself published and read. Summarising the \"drift\" of\r\nMatthew Arnold, Mr Chesterton observes:\r\n\r\n     \"The chief of his services may perhaps be stated thus, that he\r\n     discovered (for the modern English) the purely intellectual\r\n     importance of humility. He had none of that hot humility which is\r\n     the fascination of saints and good men. But he had a cold humility\r\n     which he had discovered to be a mere essential of the\r\n     intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a humility, purely hygienic in character, is for Englishmen the\r\nbeginning of wisdom on the Irish Question. It is the needle's eye by\r\nwhich alone they can enter a city otherwise forbidden to them. Let there\r\nbe no misunderstanding. The attitude of mind commended to them is not\r\nwithout its agreeable features. Closely scrutinised, it is seen to be a\r\nsort of inverted vanity. The student begins by studying himself, an\r\nexercise in self-appraisal which need not by any means involve\r\nself-depreciation. What sort of a mind, then, is the English mind?\r\n\r\nIf there is anything in regard to which the love of friends corroborates\r\nthe malice of enemies it is in ascribing to the English an\r\nindividualism, hard-shelled beyond all human parallel. The Englishman's\r\ncountry is an impregnable island, his house is a castle, his temperament\r\nis a suit of armour. The function common to all three is to keep things\r\nout, and most admirably has he used them to that end. At first, indeed,\r\nhe let everybody in; he had a perfect passion for being conquered, and\r\nRomans, Teutons, Danes, and Normans in succession plucked and ate the\r\napple of England. But with the coming of age of that national\r\nconsciousness, the bonds of which have never been snapped, the English\r\nentered on their lucky and courageous career of keeping things out. They\r\npossess in London the only European capital that has never in the modern\r\nperiod been captured by an invader. They withstood the intellectual\r\ngrandeur of Roman Law, and developed their own medley of customs into\r\nthe most eccentric and most equitable system in the world. They kept out\r\nthe Council of Trent, and the Spanish Armada. They kept out the French\r\nRevolution, and Napoleon. They kept out for a long time the Kantian\r\nphilosophy, Romanticism, Pessimism, Higher Criticism, German music,\r\nFrench painting, and one knows not how many other of the intellectual\r\nexperiments that made life worth living, or not worth living, to\r\nnineteenth-century Europe. Their insularity, spiritual as well as\r\ngeographical, has whetted the edge of a thousand flouts and gibes.\r\n\"Those stupid French!\" exclaims the sailor, as reported by De Morgan:\r\n\"Why do they go on calling a cabbage a _shoe_ when they must know that\r\nit is a _cabbage?_\" This was in general the attitude of what Mr Newbolt\r\nhas styled the \"Island Race\" when on its travels. Everybody has laughed\r\nat the comedy of it, but no one has sufficiently applauded its success.\r\nThe English tourist declined to be at the trouble of speaking any\r\nforeign tongue whatsoever; instantly every hotel and restaurant on the\r\nContinent was forced to learn English. He refused to read their books; a\r\nLeipsic firm at once started to publish his own, and sold him his\r\nsix-shilling Clapham novels in Lucerne for two francs. He dismissed\r\nwith indignation the idea of breakfasting on a roll, and bacon and eggs\r\nwere added unto him. In short, by a straightforward policy of studying\r\nnobody else, he compelled everybody else to study him.\r\n\r\nNow it is idle to deny this performance the applause which it plainly\r\ndeserves. The self-evolution of England, as it may perhaps be called, in\r\nits economic, political, and literary life, offers an admirable model of\r\nconcentration and energy. Even where it is a case of obtuseness to other\r\ncivilisations, at least as high but of a different type, the verdict\r\ncannot be wholly unfavourable. The Kingdom of Earth is to the\r\nthick-skinned, and bad manners have a distinct vital value. A man, too\r\nsensitive to the rights and the charms of others, is in grave danger of\r\nfutility. Either he will become a dilettante, which is the French way,\r\nor he will take to drink and mystical nihilism, a career very popular in\r\nRussian fiction. Bad manners have indeed a distinct ethical value. We\r\nall experience moods in which we politely assent to the thing that is\r\nnot, because of the fatigue of fighting for the thing that is. A\r\ntemperament such as has been delineated is therefore, as human types go,\r\nan excellent type. But it has its peculiar perils. To ignore the point\r\nof view of those in whose country you eat, drink, sleep, and sight-see\r\nmay breed only minor discords, and after all you will pay for your\r\nmanners in your bill. But to ignore the point of view of those whose\r\ncountry you govern may let loose a red torrent of tragedy. Such a temper\r\nof mind may, at the first touch of resistance, transform your stolid,\r\nlaudable, laughable Englishman into the beastliest of tyrants. It may\r\ndrive him into a delirium of cruelty and injustice. It may sweep away,\r\nin one ruin of war, wealth, culture, and the whole fabric of\r\ncivilisation. It may darken counsel, and corrupt thought. In fact, it\r\nmay give you something very like the history of the English in Ireland.\r\nNow it is not denied that most Englishmen believe the English mind to be\r\nincapable of such excesses. This, they say, is the Russian in Warsaw,\r\nthe Austrian in Budapest, the Belgian in the Congo, the blind fool-fury\r\nof the Seine. But it is not the English way. Nor is it suggested that\r\nthis illusion is sheer and mere hypocrisy. It is simply an hallucination\r\nof jingoism. Take a trivial instance in point. We have all read in the\r\nnewspapers derisive accounts of disorderly scenes in the French Chamber\r\nor the Austrian Reichstag; we all know the complacent sigh with which\r\nEngland is wont on such occasions to thank God that she is not as one\r\nof those. Does anybody think that this attitude will be at all modified\r\nby recent occurrences at Westminster? By no means. Lord Hugh Cecil, his\r\ngibbering and gesticulating quite forgotten, will be assuring the House\r\nnext year that the Irish are so deficient in self-restraint as to be\r\nunfit for Home Rule. Mr Smith will be deploring that intolerant temper\r\nwhich always impels a Nationalist to shout down, and not to argue down\r\nan opponent. Mr Walter Long will be vindicating the cause of law and\r\norder in one sentence, and inciting \"Ulster\" to bloodshed in the next.\r\nThis is not hypocrisy, it is genius. It is also, by the way, the genesis\r\nof the Irish Question. If anyone is disposed to underrate the mad\r\npassions of which race hatred can slip the leash, let him recall the\r\ncrucial examples which we have had in our own time. We have in our own\r\ntime seen Great Britain inflamed by two frenzies--against France, and\r\nagainst the Boer Republics. In the history of public opinion there are\r\nno two chapters more discreditable. In the days of Fashoda the Frenchman\r\nwas a degenerate _tigre-singe,_ the sworn enemy of religion and soap. He\r\nhad contributed nothing to civilisation except a loathsome science of\r\nsensuality, and the taint of decay was in his bones. In the days of\r\nSpion Kop the Boer was an unlaundered savage, fit only to be a target\r\nfor pig-stickers. His ignorance seemed the most appalling thing in the\r\nworld until one remembered his hypocrisy and his cowardice. The\r\nnewspaper which led the campaign of denigration against France has come\r\nto another view. Its proprietor now divides his time between signing\r\n£10,000 cheques for triumphant French aviators, and delivering speeches\r\nin which their nation is hailed as the pioneer of all great ideas. As\r\nregards the Boers, the same reversal of the verdict of ten years ago has\r\ntaken place. The crowd which in 1900 asked only for a sour appletree on\r\nwhich to hang General Botha, adopts him in 1911 as the idol of the\r\nCoronation. At this progress towards sanity we must all rejoice. But\r\nmost of all we have to ask that these two sinister pageants of race\r\nhatred shall not be suffered to dissolve without leaving some wrack of\r\nwisdom behind. Writers on psychology have made many studies of what they\r\ncall the collective illusion. This strange malady, which consists in all\r\nthe world seeing something which in fact does not exist, wrought more\r\npotently on the mind of England than did reason and justice in the Home\r\nRule controversies of 1886 and 1893. What has occurred may recur. And\r\nsince we are to speak here with all the candour of private conversation\r\nI confess that I cannot devise or imagine any specific against such a\r\nrecurrence except an exercise in humility of the kind suggested by Mr\r\nChesterton. My own argument in that direction is perhaps compromised by\r\nthe fact that I am an Irishman. Let us therefore fall back on other\r\ntestimony. Out of the cloud of witnesses let us choose two or three, and\r\nin the first place M. Alfred Fouillée. M. Fouillée is a Platonist--the\r\nlast Platonist in Europe--and consequently an amiable man. He is\r\nuniversally regarded as the leader of philosophy in France, a position\r\nnot in the least shaken by Bergson's brief authority. In a charming and\r\nlucid study of the \"Psychology of the Peoples of Europe\" Fouillée has\r\nmany pages that might serve for an introduction to the Irish Question.\r\nThe point of interest in his analysis is this: he exhibits Irish history\r\nas a tragedy of character, a tragedy which flows with sad, inevitable\r\nlogic from a certain weakness which he notes, not in the Irish, but in\r\nthe English character.\r\n\r\n     \"'In the eyes of the English,' says Taine who had studied them so\r\n     minutely, 'there is but one reasonable civilisation, namely their\r\n     own. Every other way of living is that of inferior beings, every\r\n     other religion is extravagant.' So that, one might add, the\r\n     Englishman is doubly personal, first as an individual and again as\r\n     a member of the most highly individualised of nations. The moment\r\n     the national interest is involved all dissensions cease, there is\r\n     on the scene but one single man, one single Englishman, who shrinks\r\n     from no expedient that may advance his ends. Morality for him\r\n     reduces itself to one precept: Safeguard at any cost the interest\r\n     of England.\"\r\n\r\nLike all foreigners he takes Ireland as the one conspicuous and flaming\r\nfailure of England. In that instance she has muddled, as usual, but she\r\nhas not muddled through.\r\n\r\n     \"The Anglo-Saxons, those great colonisers of far-off lands, have in\r\n     their own United Kingdom succeeded only in inflicting a long\r\n     martyrdom on Ireland. The insular situation of England had for\r\n     pendant the insular situation of Ireland; the two islands lie there\r\n     face to face. The English and the Irish, although intellectually\r\n     very much alike, have preserved different characters. And this\r\n     difference cannot be due essentially to the racial element, for\r\n     nearly half Ireland is Germanic. It is due to traditions and\r\n     customs developed by English oppression.\"\r\n\r\nHaving summarised the main lines of British policy in Ireland, he\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n     \"It is not easy to detect here any sign of the 'superiority of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxons.'\"\r\n\r\nWith Fouillée we may associate Emile Boutmy. In his \"Political\r\nPsychology of the English\" he declares that the haughty, taciturn,\r\nsolitary, unassimilative temperament of England, so admirable from the\r\npoint of view of self-development, shows its worst side and comes to a\r\nmalign florescence in the history of Ireland. It explains why\r\n\r\n     \"the relations of Ireland with England have been, for so many\r\n     centuries, those of a captive with his jailer, those of a victim\r\n     with his torturer.\"\r\n\r\nI pass over De Beaumont, Von Raumer, Perraud, Paul-Dubois, Filon, Bonn.\r\nThe considerations already adduced ought to be enough to lead the\r\nEnglish reader to certain conclusions which are fundamental. For the\r\nsake of clearness they may be repeated in all their nudity:\r\n\r\nEngland has failed in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHer failure has been due to defects of her own character, and\r\nlimitations of her outlook. The same defects which corrupted her policy\r\nin the past distort her vision in the present.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if she is to understand and to solve the Irish Question, she\r\nmust begin by breaking the hard shell of her individualism, and trying\r\nto think herself into the skin, the soul, and the ideals of the Irish\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nNow the English reader is after all human. If he has endured so far the\r\noutrage on his most sacred prejudices perpetrated in this chapter he\r\nmust at this moment be hot with resentment. He must feel as if,\r\nproposing to his imagination Pear de Melba, he had in truth swallowed\r\nsand. Let me end with a more comfortable word. We have seen that Irish\r\nhistory is what the dramatists call an internal tragedy, the secular\r\ndisclosure and slow working-out of certain flaws in the English\r\ncharacter. I am not to be understood as ascribing horns to England and a\r\nhalo to Ireland. We Irish are not only imperfect but even modest; for\r\nevery beam that we detect in another eye we are willing to confess a\r\nmote in our own. The English on the other hand have been not monsters or\r\ndemons, but men unstrung.\r\n\r\n    \"In tragic life, God wot,\r\n    No villain need be, passions spin the plot;\r\n    We are betrayed by what is false within.\"\r\n\r\nLeast of all am I to be understood as ascribing to modern Englishmen any\r\nsort of planned, aforethought malice in regard to Ireland. It is what\r\nBacon might have called a mere idol of the platform to suppose that they\r\nare filled with a burning desire to oppress Ireland. The dream of their\r\nlives is to ignore her, to eliminate from their calculations this\r\nvariable constant which sheds bewilderment upon every problem. Could\r\nthey but succeed in that, a very Sabbath of peace would have dawned for\r\nthem. The modern Englishman is too much worried to plan the oppression\r\nof anybody. \"Did you ever,\" asked Lord Salisbury on a remembered\r\noccasion, \"have a boil on your neck?\" To the Englishman of 1911--that\r\ntroubled man whose old self-sufficiency has in our own time been\r\nshattered beyond repair by Boer rifles, German shipyards, French\r\naeroplanes--Ireland is the boil on the neck of his political system. It\r\nis the one _péché de jeunesse_ of his nation that will not sleep in the\r\ngrave of the past. Like the ghost in \"Hamlet\" it pursues and plagues him\r\nwithout respite. Shunned on the battlements it invades his most private\r\nchamber, or, finding him in talk with friends, shames and scares him\r\nwith subterranean mutterings. Is there no way out of a situation so\r\ntroublesome and humiliating?\r\n\r\nThere is. Ireland cannot be ignored, but she can easily be appeased. The\r\nboil is due to no natural and incurable condition. It is the direct\r\nresult of certain artificial ligatures and compressions; remove these\r\nand it disappears. This spectre haunts the conscience of England to\r\nincite her not to a deed of blood but to a deed of justice; every wind\r\nis favourable and every omen. It is, indeed, true that if she is to\r\nsucceed, England must do violence to certain prejudices which now\r\nafflict her like a blindness; she must deal with us as a man with men.\r\nBut is not the Kingdom of Heaven taken by violence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n_(a) Coloured_\r\n\r\n\r\nMendacity follows the flag. There never yet was an invader who did not,\r\nin obedience to a kindly human instinct, lie abundantly respecting the\r\npeople whose country he had invaded. The reason is very plain. In all\r\nages men delight to acquire property by expedients other than that of\r\nhonest labour. In the period of private war the most obvious alternative\r\nto working is fighting, or hiring servants to fight; the sword is\r\nmightier than the spade. If we add that an expedition into a foreign\r\ncountry offers the additional advantages of escape from your exacting\r\ncreditors, and your still more exacting king, we have something very\r\nlike the economics of the Invasion of Anywhere in early feudal times.\r\nHad the leaders of these invasions, or rather their clerkly secretaries,\r\nwritten the plain tale of their doings they would have left some such\r\nrecord as this: \"There were we, a band of able-bodied, daring, needy\r\nmen. Our only trade was war; our only capital our suits of armour, our\r\nswords and battle-axes. We heard that there was good land and rich booty\r\nto be had in Anywhere; we went and fought for it. Our opponents were\r\nbrave men, too, but badly organised. In some places we won. There we\r\nsubstituted our own law for the queer sort of law under which these\r\npeople had lived; when they resisted too strongly we had, of course, no\r\noption but to kill them. In other places we got mixed up completely by\r\nalliances and marriages with the old stock, and lived most agreeably\r\nwith them. In others again the natives killed us, and remained in\r\npossession. Such was the Invasion of Anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nBut (I had almost said unhappily) the invaders were not content with\r\nhaving swords, they had also consciences. They were Christians, and\r\nthought it necessary to justify themselves before the High Court of\r\nChristian Europe. Consequently the clerks had to write up the record in\r\nquite a different fashion. They discovered that their bluff,\r\nhard-bitten, rather likeable employers, scarcely one of whom could read\r\nor write, had really invaded Anywhere as the trustees of civilisation.\r\nNow it may be said in general--and the observation extends to our own\r\ntime--that the moment an invader discovers that he is the trustee of\r\ncivilisation he is irretrievably lost to the truth. He is forced by his\r\nown pose to become not an unprincipled liar, but that much more\r\ndisgusting object, a liar on principle. He is bound, in order to\r\nlegitimise his own position, to prove that \"the natives\" are savages,\r\nliving in a morass of nastiness and ignorance. All facts must be adapted\r\nto this conclusion. The clerks, having made this startling discovery,\r\nwent on to supplement it by the further discovery that their masters had\r\ninvaded Anywhere in order to please the Pope, and introduce true\r\nreligion. This second role completes the dedication of the invaders on\r\nthe altar of mendacity. It was Leo XIII. himself who, with that charming\r\nhumour of his, deprecated the attitude of certain _a priori_ historians\r\nwho, said he, if they were writing the Gospel story would, in their\r\nanxiety to please the Pope, probably suppress the denial of Peter.\r\n\r\nThese things which might have happened anywhere did, in fact, happen in\r\nIreland. Out of the footprints of the invaders there sprang up a legion\r\nof fictionists, professional cooks of history. Beginning with Giraldus\r\nCambrensis they ought to have ended, but, as we shall see, did not end\r\nwith Froude. The significance of these mercenaries of literature can\r\nhardly be exaggerated; it is not too much to say that they found Ireland\r\na nation, and left her a question. It is not at all that they put on\r\nrecord the thing that was not as regards the events of their own period.\r\nThat might be and has been amended by the labours of impartial\r\nscholarship. The real crime of the fabulists lies in this, that their\r\ntainted testimony constituted for honest Englishmen the only information\r\nabout Ireland easily obtainable. The average Englishman (that is to say,\r\nthe forty millions of him who do not read learned books of any kind)\r\ncomes to the consideration of contemporary Ireland with a vision\r\ndistorted almost beyond hope of cure. The treasured lies of seven\r\nhundred years are in his heart to-day. For time runs against the cause\r\nof truth as well as with it. Once create a Frankenstein of race hatred,\r\nand he will gather strength in going. The chronicler's fable of this\r\ncentury becomes the accredited historical fact of the next. Give it what\r\nbilliard-players call \"legs\" enough and it will mature into a tradition,\r\na proverb, a spontaneous instinct. There is a whole department of\r\nresearch concerned with the growth of myths, stage by stage, from a\r\nlittle nebulous blotch into a peopled world of illusion. The strange\r\nevolution there set forth finds an exact parallel in the development of\r\nEnglish opinion on Ireland. And, indeed, the more you study \"the Irish\r\nQuestion,\" as it is envisaged by the ruling mind of Great Britain, the\r\nmore conscious are you of moving in the realm not of reason but of\r\nmythology.\r\n\r\nAll this will seem obvious even to the point of weariness. But it is of\r\ninterest as furnishing a clue to the English attitude towards Irish\r\nhistory; I should rather say attitudes, for there are two. The first is\r\nthat of the Man of Feeling. His mode of procedure recalls inevitably an\r\nexquisite story which is to be found somewhere in Rousseau. During\r\ncountry walks, Jean Jacques tells us, his father would suddenly say: \"My\r\nson, we will speak of your dear, dead mother.\" And Jean Jacques was\r\nexpected to reply: \"Wait, then, a moment, my dear father. I will first\r\nsearch for my handkerchief, for I perceive that we are going to weep.\"\r\nIn precisely such a mood of deliberate melancholy does the\r\nsentimentalist address himself to the Confiscations and the Penal Laws.\r\nHe is ready to praise without stint any Irish leader who happens to be\r\nsufficiently dead. He is ready to confess that all his own British\r\nforerunners were abominable blackguards. He admits, not only with\r\ncandour but even with a certain enthusiastic remorse, that England\r\noppressed Ireland in every phase of their relations. Then comes the\r\nconclusion. So terrible have been the sins of his fathers that he feels\r\nbound to make restitution. And in order to make restitution, to be kind\r\nand helpful and remedial, he must retain the management of Irish affairs\r\nin his benevolent hands. In order to expiate the crimes of the past he\r\nmust repeat the basal blunder that was the cause and source of them. For\r\nthis kind of sympathy we have only to say, in a somewhat vulgar phrase,\r\nthat we have no use whatever. The Englishman who \"sympathises\" with\r\nIreland is lost.\r\n\r\nBut the more general attitude differs widely from this. Confronting us\r\nwith a bluff and not unkindly demeanour, worthy of the nation that\r\ninvented cold baths as a tonic against all spiritual anguish, the\r\npractical, modern Englishman speaks out his mind in straight-flung words\r\nand few. \"You fellows,\" he says, \"brood too much over the past. After\r\nall, this is the twentieth century, not the twelfth. What does it matter\r\nwhether my ancestors murdered yours or not? Both would be dead now in\r\nany event. What does it matter whether yours were the saints and men of\r\nletters and mine the savages, or whether the boot was on the other leg?\r\nThat's all over and done with. Imitate me. Let bygones be bygones.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is, in some respects, the authentic voice of health.\r\nUndoubtedly the most characteristic thing about the past is that it is\r\nnot present, and to lavish on it too tragic and intense a devotion is to\r\nlove death more than life. And yet our bluff Englishman can learn in two\r\nwords how it comes about that his invitation represents a demand for the\r\nimpossible. In the first place, the bygones have not gone by. Our\r\ncomplaint is made not against the crimes of his fathers, who are dead,\r\nbut against the crimes of himself and his fellows, who are alive. We\r\ndenounce not the repealed Penal Laws but the unrepealed Act of Union. If\r\nwe recall to the memory of England the systematic baseness of the\r\nformer, it is in order to remind her that she once thought them right,\r\nand now confesses that they were cruelly wrong. We Irish are realists,\r\nand we hold the problems of the present as of more account than any\r\nagonies or tyrannies of the past. But our realism has the human touch in\r\nit, and that constitutes the second impossibility in the invitation\r\ntendered us. _Que messieurs les assassins commencent!_ The anti-Irish\r\nlegend is not dead nor even sleeping, nor are the resources of calumny\r\nyet exhausted. An instance is immediately at hand. I have, at this\r\nmoment, on my desk a volume lately issued--\"The School History of\r\nEngland.\" It is published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford; Mr Rudyard\r\nKipling contributes twenty-three pieces of verse, and a Mr C. R. L.\r\nFletcher, whose qualifications are not stated, appears to be responsible\r\nfor the prose. The book has been praised in most of the papers, and it\r\nwill no doubt go far. This is the picture of the coming to Ireland of\r\nthe Cymro-Frankish adventurers which its pages will imprint on the minds\r\nof the youth of England:\r\n\r\n     \"One event of his reign (Henry II.'s) must not be forgotten, his\r\n     visit to Ireland in 1171-2. St Patrick, you may have heard, had\r\n     banished the snakes from that island, but he had not succeeded in\r\n     banishing the murderers and thieves who were worse than many\r\n     snakes. In spite of some few settlements of Danish pirates and\r\n     traders on the eastern coast, Ireland had remained purely Celtic\r\n     and purely a pasture country. All wealth was reckoned in cows; Rome\r\n     had never set foot there, so there was a king for every day in the\r\n     week, and the sole amusement of such persons was to drive off each\r\n     other's cows and to kill all who resisted. In Henry II.'s time this\r\n     had been going on for at least seven hundred years, and during the\r\n     seven hundred that have followed much the same thing would have\r\n     been going on, if the English Government had not occasionally\r\n     interfered.\"\r\n\r\nThe English whom Henry II. left behind him soon became \"as wild and\r\nbarbarous as the Irishmen themselves.\"\r\n\r\nOxford, the home of so many other lost causes, apparently aspires to be\r\nalso the home of the lost cause of mendacity. The forcible-feeble malice\r\nof Mr Fletcher calls for no serious discussion; submit it to any\r\ncontinental scholar, to any honest British scholar, and he will ask\r\ncontemptuously, though perhaps with a little stab of pain, how the name\r\nof Oxford comes to be associated with such wicked absurdities. Every\r\nother reference to Ireland is marked by the same scientific composure\r\nand balanced judgment. And this document, inspired by race hatred, and\r\napparently designed to propagate race hatred, is offered to the youth of\r\nthese countries as an aid towards the consolidation of the Empire. It is\r\na case not merely of the poisoning of a well, but of the poisoning of a\r\ngreat river at its source. The force of cowardice can no farther go. So\r\nlong as it goes thus far, so long as the Froudes find Fletchers to echo\r\nthem, Irishmen will inevitably \"brood over the past.\" We do not share\r\nthe cult of ancestor-worship, but we hold the belief that the Irish\r\nnation, like any other, is an organism endowed with a life in some sort\r\ncontinuous and repetitive of its origins. To us it does matter something\r\nwhether our forerunners were turbulent savages, destitute of all\r\nculture, or whether they were valiant, immature men labouring through\r\nthe twilight of their age towards that dawn which does not yet flush our\r\nown horizon. But we are far from wishing that dead centuries should be\r\nsummoned back to wake old bitterness that ought also to be dead. Hand\r\nhistory over to the scholars, if you will; let it be marshalled as a\r\nmultitudinous and coloured pageant, to incite imaginations and inspire\r\nliterature. Such is our desire, but when we read the clotted nonsense of\r\npersons like Mr Fletcher we can only repeat: _Que messieurs les\r\nassassins commencent_!\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this inquiry it is inevitable that some brief account\r\nshould be rendered of the past relations between England and Ireland.\r\nThe reader need not shrink back in alarm; it is not proposed to lead him\r\nby the reluctant nose through the whole maze and morass of Irish\r\nhistory. The past is of value to political realists only in that residue\r\nof it which survives, namely, the wisdom which it ought to have taught\r\nus. Englishmen are invited to consider the history of Ireland solely\r\nfrom that point of view. They are prayed to purge themselves altogether\r\nof pity, indignation, and remorse; these are emotions far too beneficent\r\nto waste on things outside the ambit of our own immediate life. If they\r\nare wise they will come to Irish history as to a school, and they will\r\nlearn one lesson that runs through it like the refrain of a ballad. A\r\nvery simple lesson it is, just this: Ireland cannot be put down. Ireland\r\nalways has her way in the end. If the opposite view is widely held the\r\nexplanation lies on the surface. Two causes have co-operated to produce\r\nthe illusion. Everybody agrees that Great Britain has acted in a most\r\nblackguardly fashion towards Ireland; everybody assumes that\r\nblackguardism always succeeds in this world, therefore Ireland is a\r\nfailure. The only flaw in this syllogism is that it is in direct\r\nconflict with every known fact. For the rest we have to thank or blame\r\nthe sentimentalism of Mr Matthew Arnold. His proud but futile Celts who\r\n\"went down to battle but always fell\" have been mistaken for the Irish\r\nof actual history. The truth is, of course, that the phrase is in the\r\ngrand manner of symbolism. When Ecclesiastes laments that the eye is not\r\nfilled with seeing nor the ear with hearing we do not argue him deaf\r\nand blind; we take his words as a proclamation of that famine and fierce\r\nappetite of the spirit which has created all the higher religions.\r\nIreland agrees with Ecclesiastes. Perceiving that there is in matter no\r\nintegral and permanent reality she cannot be content with material\r\nvictories; her poets are subtle in what a French writer styles the\r\ninnuendoes by which the soul makes its enormous claims. The formula of\r\nher aspiration has been admirably rendered by the late Mrs Nora Chesson:\r\n\r\n    \"He follows after shadows when all your chase is done;\r\n    He follows after shadows, the King of Ireland's son.\"\r\n\r\nWere I to read the poem, of which these lines are the motif, to certain\r\ngenial Englishmen of my acquaintance they would observe that the\r\ngentleman in question was a \"queer cove, staying up late at night and\r\ncatching cold, and that no doubt there was a woman in the case.\" But\r\nthese are considerations a little remote from the daily dust of\r\npolitics. In the sense in which every life is a failure, and the best\r\nlife the worst failure, Ireland is a failure. But in every other sense,\r\nin all that touches the fathomable business of daylight, she has been a\r\nconspicuous success.\r\n\r\nA certain type of fanaticism is naive enough to regard the intercourse\r\nof England with Ireland as that of a superior with an inferior race.\r\nThis is the sanction invoked to legitimise every adventure in invasion\r\nand colonisation. M. Jules Hormand, who has attempted, in his recent\r\nbook, \"Domination et Colonisation,\" to formulate a theory of the whole\r\nsubject, touches bed-rock when he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"We must then accept as our point of departure the principle that\r\n     there is a hierarchy of races and of civilisations, and that we\r\n     belong to the higher race and civilisation.... The essential\r\n     legitimation of conquest is precisely this conviction of our own\r\n     superiority.... Nations which do not hold this belief, because\r\n     incapable of such sincerity towards themselves, should not attempt\r\n     to conquer others.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Salisbury was grasping at such a justification when he\r\nlikened the Irish to Hottentots; it would be a justification of a kind\r\nif it chanced to be validated by the facts. But it does not. There is so\r\nmuch genuine humour in the comparison that, for my part, I am unable to\r\ntake offence at it. I look at the lathe painted to look like iron, and I\r\nset over against him Parnell. That is enough; the lathe is smashed to\r\nfragments amid the colossal laughter of the gods. The truth is that in\r\nevery shock and conflict of Irish civilisation with English, it is the\r\nlatter that has given way. The obscuration of this obvious fact is\r\nprobably to be ascribed to the military successes of the Norman, or\r\nrather the Cymro-Frankish invaders. If we were the higher race why did\r\nwe not put them out? Replying on the same plane of thought we observe\r\nthat if they were the higher race they would have put us down. But a\r\nmore detailed assignment of qualities between the two peoples is\r\npossible. In general it may be said that the two stood on much the same\r\nlevel of mentality, but that they had specialised on different subjects,\r\nthe Normans on war and politics, the Irish on culture. Of the many\r\nwriters who help us to reconstruct the period we ought to signalise one,\r\nMrs A.S. Green, who to a rare scholarship adds something rarer, the\r\ngenius of common sense. This is not the place in which to recall the\r\nwhole substance of her \"Making of Ireland and its Undoing\" and her\r\n\"Irish Nationality\"; but from borrowings thence and elsewhere we can\r\npiece together a plain tale of that first chapter of the Irish Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n_(b) Plain_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days war was the most lucrative industry open to a young man of\r\nbreeding, courage, and ability. Owners of capital regarded it as a sound\r\ninvestment. What Professor Oman tells us of the Normans in 1066 was\r\nequally true of them in 1169:\r\n\r\n     \"Duke William had undertaken his expedition not as a mere feudal\r\n     lord of the barons of Normandy but rather as the managing director\r\n     of a great joint-stock company for the conquest of England, in\r\n     which not only his own subjects but hundreds of adventurers, poor\r\n     and rich, from all parts of Western Europe had taken shares.\"\r\n\r\nThe Normans, then, came to Ireland with their eyes on three objects. In\r\nthe first place, property. This was to be secured in the case of each\r\nindividual adventurer by the overthrow of some individual Irish\r\nchieftain. It necessitated war in the shape of a purely local, and\r\nindeed personal grapple. In the second place, plunder. This was to be\r\nsecured by raids, incursions, and temporary alliances. In the third\r\nplace, escape from the growing power and exactions of the Crown. This\r\nwas to be secured geographically by migration to Ireland, and\r\npolitically by delaying, resolutely if discreetly, the extension in that\r\ncountry of the over-lordship of the King. Herein lies the explanation of\r\nthe fact that for three and a half centuries the English penetration\r\ninto Ireland is a mere chaos of private appetites and egotisms. The\r\ninvaders, as we have said, were specialists in war, and in the\r\nunification of states through war. This they had done for England; this\r\nthey failed to do for Ireland. The one ingredient which, if dropped into\r\nthe seething cauldron of her life, must have produced the definite\r\ncrystallisation of a new nationality, complete in structure and\r\nfunction, was not contributed. True, the Cymro-Franks proved themselves\r\nstrong enough in arms to maintain their foothold; if that physical test\r\nis enough to establish their racial superiority then let us salute Mr\r\nJack Johnson as Zarathustra, the superman. But in their one special and\r\ncharacteristic task they failed lamentably. Instead of conquest and\r\nconsolidation they gave us mere invasion and disturbance. The disastrous\r\nrole played by them has been unfolded by many interpreters of history,\r\nby none with a more vivid accuracy than we find in the pages of M.\r\nPaul-Dubois:\r\n\r\n     \"Had Ireland,\" he writes, \"been left to herself she would, in all\r\n     human probability, have succeeded, notwithstanding her decadence,\r\n     in establishing political unity under a military chief. Had the\r\n     country been brought into peaceful contact with continental\r\n     civilisation, it must have advanced along the path of modern\r\n     progress. Even if it had been conquered by a powerful nation, it\r\n     would at least have participated in the progress of the conquering\r\n     power. But none of these things happened. England, whose political\r\n     and social development had been hastened by the Norman Conquest,\r\n     desired to extend her influence to Ireland. 'She wished,' as Froude\r\n     strangely tells us, 'to complete the work of civilisation happily\r\n     begun by the Danes.' But in actual fact she only succeeded in\r\n     trammelling the development of Irish society, and maintaining in\r\n     the country an appalling condition of decadent stagnation, as the\r\n     result of three centuries and a half of intermittent invasions,\r\n     never followed by conquest.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the triumph of Irish culture was easy and absolute.\r\nIreland, unvisited by the legions and the law of Rome, had evolved a\r\ndifferent vision of the life of men in community, or, in other words, a\r\ndifferent idea of the State. Put very briefly the difference lay in\r\nthis. The Romans and their inheritors organised for purposes of war and\r\norder, the Irish for purposes of culture. The one laid the emphasis on\r\npolice, the other on poets. But for a detailed exposition of the\r\ncontrast I must send the reader to Mrs Green's \"Irish Nationality.\" In a\r\nworld in which right is little more than a secretion of might, in which,\r\nunless a strong man armed keeps house, his enemies enter in, the\r\nweakness of the Gaelic idea is obvious. But the Roman pattern too had a\r\ncharacteristic vice which has led logically in our own time to a\r\nmonstrous and sinister growth of armaments.\r\n\r\nTo those who recognise in this deification of war the blackest menace of\r\nour day the vision of a culture State is not without charm. The\r\nshattering possibilities enfolded in it would have fevered Nietzsche and\r\nfascinated Renan. But, be that as it may, Ireland played Cleopatra to\r\nthe Antony of the invaders. Some of them, indeed, the \"garrison\" pure\r\nand simple, had all their interests centred not only in resisting but in\r\ncalumniating her. But the majority yielded gaily to her music, her\r\npoetry, her sociability, that magical quality of hers which the Germans\r\ncall _Gemütlichkeit_. In a few centuries a new and enduring phrase had\r\ndesignated them as more Irish than the Irish themselves. So far as any\r\nsuperiority of civilisation manifests itself in this first period it is\r\naltogether on the side of Ireland. This power of assimilation has never\r\ndecayed. There never was a nation, not even the United States, that so\r\nsubdued and re-fashioned those who came to her shores, that so wrought\r\nthem into her own blood and tissue. The Norman baron is transformed in a\r\nfew generations into an Irish chieftain, and as often as not into an\r\nIrish \"rebel.\" The Jacobite planter of the first decade of the\r\nseventeenth century is in the fifth decade found in arms against\r\nCromwell; the Cromwellian settler is destined in turn to shed his blood\r\nfor James II. and Catholicity. Protestant colonists who, in the early\r\neighteenth century, enforce and defend the abominable Penal Laws, will\r\nin 1782 demand, with drawn swords, that henceforth there shall be no\r\nlonger a Protestant colony but in its place an Irish nation. The\r\npersonal history of the captains of the Irish cause in modern times is\r\nno less remarkable. O'Connell begins his public career in the Yeomanry\r\ncalled out to put down the insurrectionary movement of Emmet. Isaac\r\nButt comes first into note as the orator of the Orange Party in Dublin.\r\nParnell himself steps out of a Tory milieu and tradition into the\r\ncentral tumult of agitation. Wave after incoming wave of them, her\r\nconquerors were conquered. \"Once again,\" cried Parnell in the last\r\npublic utterance of his life, \"I am come to cast myself into the deep\r\nsea of the love of my people.\" In that deep sea a hundred diverse\r\ncurrents of blood have met and mingled; they have lost their individual\r\ndrift to become part of the strong tide of national consciousness and\r\nnational unity. If Irish history is to be regarded as a test of racial\r\nsuperiority then Ireland emerges with the crown and garlands of victory.\r\nWe came, we the invaders, to dominate, and we remained to serve. For\r\nIreland has signed us with the oil and chrism of her human sacrament,\r\nand even though we should deny the faith with our lips she would hold\r\nour hearts to the end.\r\n\r\nBut let us translate her triumph into more concrete speech. The\r\nessential lesson of experience, then, is that no device, plan, or policy\r\nadopted by England for the subjugation of Ireland has ever been anything\r\nexcept an abject failure. And the positive of this negative is that\r\nevery claim that ever formed part of the national programme of Ireland\r\nhas won its way against all enmities. No plough to which she ever put\r\nher hand has been turned back or stayed eternally in mid-furrow. It does\r\nnot matter what period you call to the witness-box; the testimony is\r\nuniform and unvarying. Until Tudor times, as has been noted, there\r\ncannot be said to have been in any strict sense an English policy in\r\nIreland; there was only a scuffle of appetites. In so far as there was a\r\npolicy it consisted of sporadic murder for the one half, and for the\r\nother of an attempt to prevent all intercourse that might lead to\r\namalgamation between the two peoples. The Statute of Kilkenny--which is,\r\nall things considered, more important than the Kilkenny cats though not\r\nso well known in England--made it a capital offence for a settler to\r\nmarry an Irishwoman or to adopt the Irish language, law, or costume. The\r\nAct no doubt provided a good many ruffians with legal and even\r\necclesiastical fig-leaves with which to cover their ruffianism, and\r\npromoted among the garrison such laudable objects as rape and\r\nassassination. But as a breakwater between the two races it did not\r\nfulfil expectation. The Statute was passed in 1367: and two centuries\r\nlater Henry VIII. was forced to appoint as his Deputy the famous\r\nGarrett Fitzgerald whose life was a militant denial of every clause and\r\nletter of it. With the Tudors, after some diplomatic preliminaries, a\r\nvery clear and business-like policy was developed. Seeing that the only\r\nsort of quiet Irishman known to contemporary science was a dead\r\nIrishman, English Deputies and Governors were instructed to pacify\r\nIreland by slaughtering or starving the entire population. The record of\r\ntheir conscientious effort to obey these instructions may be studied in\r\nany writer of the period, or in any historian, say Mr Froude. For Mr\r\nFroude, in his pursuit of the picturesque, was always ready to resort to\r\nthe most extreme measures; he sometimes even went so far as to tell the\r\ntruth. The noblest and ablest English minds lent their aids. Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh and Edmund Spenser were both rather circumambulatory on paper;\r\nthe work of each is 'a long monotone broken by two or three exquisite\r\nimmortalities. But they were both as concise in action as an Elizabethan\r\nheadsman. Sir Walter helped Lord Grey, the recognised pattern in those\r\ndays of the Christian gentleman, to put to death seven hundred\r\nprisoners-of-war at Smerwick. Spenser, being no soldier, leaned rather\r\nto famine. In his famous book he recommends the destruction of crops,\r\nhouses, cattle, and all necessaries of life so that the Irish should\r\n\"soon be compelled to devour each other.\" The Commanders-in-Chief and\r\nthe Deputies specialised in poison, as became men whose wealth and\r\nlearning enabled them to keep in touch with the Italian Renaissance.\r\nBluff, straightforward troopers like Mountjoy, Malby, Wilmot, Bagenal,\r\nChichester, and the rest, not pretending to such refinements, did their\r\nbest in the way of hanging, stabbing, and burning. In those days as well\r\nas ours the children had their Charter. \"Nits,\" said the trustees of\r\ncivilisation, \"will grow to lice.\" And so they tossed them on the points\r\nof their swords, thus combining work with play, or fed them on the roast\r\ncorpses of their relatives, and afterwards strangled them with tresses\r\nof their mother's hair.\r\n\r\nI do not recall these facts in order to show that Elizabethan policy was\r\na riot of blackguardism. That is obvious, and it is irrelevant. I\r\nmention them in order to show that the blackguardism under review was an\r\nunrelieved failure. At one time, indeed, it seemed to have succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"Ireland, brayed as in a mortar, to use Sir John Davies' phrase,\" writes\r\nM. Paul-Dubois, \"at last submitted. In the last years of the century\r\nhalf the population had perished. Elizabeth reigned over corpses and\r\nashes. _Hibernia Pacata_--Ireland is 'pacified.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blunder discloses itself at a glance. Only half the population had\r\nperished; there were still alive, according to the most probable\r\nestimate, quite two hundred thousand Irishmen. The next generation helps\r\nto illustrate not only the indestructibility of Ireland, but her all but\r\nmiraculous power of recuperation. So abundant are the resources of his\r\nown vitality that, as Dr Moritz Bonn declares, an Irish peasant can live\r\nwhere a continental goat would starve. And not having read Malthus--Mr\r\nMalthus at that time being even less readable than since--the Irish\r\nremnant proceeded to develop anew into a nation. In forty years it was\r\nmarching behind that _beau chevalier_ Owen Roe O'Neill to battle and\r\nvictory. O'Neill, a general famous through Europe, the one man who might\r\nhave measured equal swords with Cromwell, was removed by poison, and\r\nthen came the massacres. In eleven years, Sir William Petty assures us,\r\n616,000 out of a total population of 1,466,000 perished by the sword or\r\nby starvation. For the remainder the policy of root and branch\r\nextermination was abandoned in favour of a policy of State-aided\r\nmigration and emigration. As an alternative to hell the Irish were\r\ndeported to Connaught or the Barbadoes. Henceforth there were to be\r\nthree provinces of loyal English, and one of rebelly Irish. This again\r\nwas not a radiant success. The transformation of the Cromwellian settler\r\nhas been indicated; if you were to search for him to-day you would\r\nprobably find him President of the local branch of the United Irish\r\nLeague. The story repeats itself period after period. The Penal Laws did\r\nnot protestantise Ireland. The eighteenth century may be said to mark\r\nthe lowest ebb of national life, but the tide was to turn. After Aughrim\r\nand the Boyne, the new device of England was to sacrifice everything to\r\nthe \"garrison.\" \"Protestant Ireland,\" as Grattan put it, \"knelt to\r\nEngland on the necks of her countrymen.\" In one aspect the garrison were\r\ntyrants; in another they were slaves. They were at once oppressors and\r\noppressed. There was a sort of \"deal\" between them and the English\r\nGovernment by which the public welfare was to be sacrificed to the\r\nEnglish Government, the Irish Catholics to the \"garrison.\" A vile\r\nprogramme, but subtle and adroit, it bore its unnatural fruit of\r\nlegislation, passed by the Westminster Parliament and the Dublin\r\nGarrison Parliament alike, for the destruction of every manufacturing\r\nand commercial interest in Ireland that was thought to conflict with a\r\nsimilar interest in England. But another debacle has to be chronicled.\r\nOut of the very baseness of this regime a new patriotism was begotten.\r\nThe garrison, awakening abruptly to the fact that it had no country,\r\ndetermined to invent one; and there was brought to birth that modern\r\nIreland, passionate for freedom, which has occupied the stage ever\r\nsince. In our own time it has knit, as a fractured limb knits, into one\r\ntissue with the tradition of the Gaelic peasantry. Hanging and burning,\r\ntorture and oppression, poison and Penal Laws, bribes and blackguardism\r\nso far from exterminating the Irish people actually hammered them into a\r\nnation, one and indestructible, proud of its past and confident of its\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nTake instances still more recent and particular--the struggle for\r\nreligious freedom or the struggle for the land. Catholic emancipation is\r\na leading case: obstinacy against obstinacy, the No! of England against\r\nthe Yes! of Ireland, and the former sprawling in the ditch at the end of\r\nthe tussle. \"The Law,\" ran the dictum of an eighteenth-century Lord\r\nChancellor, \"does not suppose any such person to exist as an Irish\r\nRoman Catholic.\" At this moment a Catholic holds the seals and purse of\r\nthe Chancellorship. Never did ministers swallow their own stubborn words\r\nmore incontinently than did Peel and Wellington. So late as 1828 Peel\r\nwas loudly declaring that the continuance of these bars, which excluded\r\nthe Catholics from the acquisition of political power, was necessary for\r\nthe maintenance of the Constitution and the safety of the Church, and\r\nWellington was echoing his words. A year later, utterly defeated by\r\nO'Connell, Peel was introducing the Catholic Relief Bill in the Commons.\r\nWellington had it for his task to induce, or rather frighten the king to\r\nassent. Ireland not only emancipated the Catholics, she went on to\r\nemancipate the Dissenters, a service of freedom of conscience which is\r\ntoo often forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Tithe System was similarly declared to be part of the fabric of the\r\nConstitution, to be upheld at the point of the bayonet. Scythe in hand,\r\nthe Irish peasant proclaimed that it must go. It went. Still more\r\nfundamental was the existence of the Protestant Established Church. To\r\ntouch it was to lay hands on the Ark. Orange orators threatened civil\r\nwar; two hundred thousand Ulstermen were to shoulder their Minie\r\nRifles, and not merely slaughter the Catholics but even depose Queen\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nIreland said that the Establishment too must go; and, with the echoed\r\nmenace of Fenianism ringing in his ears, Mr Gladstone hauled down the\r\nofficial blazon of Ascendancy. \"Ulster\" did not fight. But the fierce\r\nstruggle for the land affords the crucial test. Landlordism of that most\r\nsavage type which held for its whole gospel that a man may do what he\r\nlikes with his own was conceived to be the very corner-stone of British\r\nrule in Ireland. It controlled Parliament, the judiciary, the schools,\r\nthe Press, and possessed in the Royal Irish Constabulary an incomparable\r\nwatch-dog. It had resisted the criticism and attack loosened against it\r\nby the scandal of the Great Famine. Then suddenly Ireland took the\r\nbusiness in hand. On a certain day in October 1879, some thirty men met\r\nin a small hotel in Dublin and, under the inspiration of Michael Davitt,\r\nfounded the Land League. To the programme then formulated, the\r\nexpropriation of the landlords at twenty years' purchase of their rents,\r\nEngland as usual said No! The proposal was thundered against as\r\nconfiscation, communism, naked and shameful. To any student, with\r\npatience sufficient for the task, the contemporary files of such\r\njournals as the _Times_ will furnish an exquisite chapter in the\r\nliterature of obtuseness. England sustained her No! with batons,\r\nbullets, plank-beds, Coercion courts, and an occasional halter; Ireland\r\nher Yes! with \"agitation.\" Is it necessary to ask who won? Is it\r\nnecessary to trace step by step the complete surrender of the last\r\nditchers of those days? The fantastic and wicked dreams of the agitators\r\nhave in thirty years translated themselves into Statute Law and solid\r\nfact. An English statesman of the period, say Mr Balfour or Mr Wyndham,\r\nis fortunate if, with a few odd rags pilfered from the Land League\r\nwardrobe, he can conceal from history his utter poverty of ideas.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the essential wisdom of Irish history: Ireland has won\r\nall along the line. The Normans did not normanise her. The Tudors did\r\nnot exterminate her. She has undone the Confiscations, and drawn a\r\ncancelling pen through the Penal Laws. The Act of Union, so far from\r\nsuppressing her individuality or overwhelming it, has actually brought\r\nit to that full self-consciousness which constitutes the coming of age\r\nof a nation. Tears, as we read in Wordsworth, to human suffering are\r\ndue; if there be anyone with tears at command he may shed them, with\r\ngreat fitness, and with no profit at all, over the long martyrdom of\r\nIreland. But let him, at least if he values facts, think twice before he\r\ngoes on to apply to her that other line which speaks of human hopes\r\ndefeated and overthrown. No other people in the world has held so\r\nstaunchly to its inner vision; none other has, with such fiery patience,\r\nrepelled the hostility of circumstances, and in the end reshaped them\r\nafter the desire of her heart. Hats off to success, gentlemen! Your\r\nmodern God may well be troubled at sight of this enigmatic Ireland which\r\nat once despises him, and tumbles his faithfullest worshippers in the\r\nsand of their own amphitheatre. Yet, so it is. The Confederate General,\r\nseeing victory suddenly snatched from his hands, and not for the first\r\ntime, by Meagher's Brigade, exclaimed in immortal profanity: \"There\r\ncomes that damned Green Flag again!\" I have often commended that phrase\r\nto Englishmen as admirably expressive of the historical role and record\r\nof Ireland in British Politics. The damned Green Flag flutters again in\r\ntheir eyes, and if they will but listen to the music that marches with\r\nit, they will find that the lamenting fifes are dominated wholly by the\r\ndrums of victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE OBVIOUSNESS OF HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland, then, has made it her foible to be not only right but\r\nirresistible in her past demands. What is it that she now claims, and on\r\nwhat grounds? She claims the right to enter into possession of her own\r\nsoul. She claims the _toga virilis_, and all the strengthening burdens\r\nof freedom. Now it is difficult to represent such a demand in terms of\r\nargument. Liberty is no mere conclusion of linked logic long-drawn out:\r\nit is an axiom, a flaming avatar. The arguments by which it is defended\r\nare important, but they bear to it much the same relation that a table\r\nof the wave-lengths of various rays of light bears to the immediate\r\nglory of a sunrise. There is another obstacle. Self-government, like\r\nother spiritual realities, say love or civilisation, is too vast,\r\nobvious, and natural to be easily imprisoned in words. You are certainly\r\nin love; suppose you were suddenly asked \"to state the case\" for love?\r\nYou are probably civilised; suppose you were suddenly asked \"to state\r\nthe case for civilisation\"? So it is with the Home Rule idea. To ask\r\nwhat is the gate of entrance to it is like asking what was the gate of\r\nentrance to hundred-gated Thebes. My friend, Mr Barry O'Brien, in\r\nlecturing on Ireland, used to begin by recounting a very agreeable and\r\nappropriate story. A prisoner on trial was asked whether he would accept\r\nfor his case the jury which had tried the last. He objected very\r\nvehemently. \"Well, but,\" said the Judge, \"what is the nature of your\r\nobjection? Do you object to the panel or to the array?\" \"Ah!\" replied\r\nthe traverser, \"if you want to know, I object to the whole damned\r\nbusiness.\" That is approximately our objection to the present system of\r\ngovernment in Ireland. But let me attempt to group under a series of\r\nsomewhat arbitrary headings the \"case for Home Rule,\" that is to say,\r\nthe case for applying to Ireland the plain platitudes of constitutional\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter roots in the fact of nationality. Nationality is to\r\npolitical life what personality is to mental life, the mainspring,\r\nnamely, of the mechanism. The two principles of organisation have this\r\nin common, that although by, through, and for them the entire pageant\r\nof our experience is unfolded, we are unable to capture either of them\r\nin a precise formula. That I am a person I know; but what is a person?\r\nThat Ireland is a nation I know; but what is a nation? \"A community of\r\nmemories and hopes,\" says Anatole France; but that applies to a football\r\nclub. Something for which a man will die, says Mr T. M. Healy: but men\r\nwill die for strange reasons; there was a French poet who shot himself\r\nbecause the trees were always green in the spring and never, for a\r\nchange, blue or red. A cultural unit, say the anthropologists; an idea\r\nof the divine mind, declare Mazzini and the mystics' of sociology. Each\r\nof these formulas possesses a certain relative truth, but all of them\r\ntogether come short of the whole truth. Nationality, which acts better\r\nperhaps than it argues, is one of the great forces of nature and of\r\nhuman nature that have got to be accepted. Nationality will out, and\r\nwhere it exists it will, in spite of all resistance, strain fiercely to\r\nexpress itself in some sort of autonomous government.\r\n\r\nGerman romance depicts for us the misery and restlessness of a man who\r\nhad lost his shadow. Catholic theologians--if the masters of a wisdom\r\ntoo high and too austere for these days may be invoked--tell us that\r\nthe departed soul, even though it be in Paradise, hungers with a great\r\ndesire for the Resurrection that it may be restored to its life-long\r\ncomrade, the body.\r\n\r\n    \"The crimson-throbbing glow\r\n    Into its old abode aye pants to go.\"\r\n\r\nLook again at Ireland and you will discern, under all conflicts, that\r\nunity of memory, of will, of material interest, of temperamental\r\natmosphere which knits men into a nation. You will notice the presence\r\nof these characteristics, but it is an absence, a void that will most\r\nimpress you. You will see not a body that has lost its shadow, but\r\nsomething more sinister--a soul that has been sundered from its natural\r\nbody. She demands restoration. She sues out a _habeas corpus_ of a kind\r\nnot elsewhere to be paralleled. That is the \"Irish Question.\"\r\n\r\nYou may not like this interpretation of things. It may seem to you\r\nfantastic, nasty, perilous to all comfort. Life often does make on the\r\ntender-hearted an impression of coarse violence; life, nevertheless,\r\nalways has its way. What other interpretation is possible? Lancashire,\r\nto take any random contrast, is much richer than Ireland in wealth and\r\npopulation; but Lancashire is not a \"Question.\" Lancashire is not a\r\n\"Question\" because Lancashire is not a nation. Ireland is a \"Question\"\r\nbecause Ireland is a nation. Her fundamental claim is a claim for the\r\nconstitutional recognition of nationality.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in almost every conflict between English and Irish\r\nideas the latter have had the justification of success. This holds good\r\nalso as regards our long insistence on nationality as a principle of\r\npolitical organisation. In various passages of the nineteenth century it\r\nseemed to be gravely compromised. Capital, its mobility indefinitely\r\nincreased by the improved technique of exchange, became essentially a\r\ncitizen of the world. The earth was all about it where to choose; its\r\nmasters, falsely identifying patriotism with the Protectionism then\r\ndominant, struck at both, and the Free Trade movement philosophised\r\nitself into cosmopolitanism. Labour, like capital, showed a rapid\r\ntendency to become international or rather supernational. \"The workers,\"\r\nproclaimed Marx, \"have no fatherland.\" While this was the drift of ideas\r\nin the economic sphere, that in the political was no more favourable.\r\nBelgium seemed on the point of extinction, Italy was a mere geographical\r\nexpression, Hungary was abject and broken. In the narrower but even\r\nmore significant sphere of British colonial policy the passion for\r\ncentralisation had not yet been understood in all its folly. Downing\r\nStreet still functioned as the Dublin Castle of the Empire. The\r\npossibility of the overseas possessions developing that rich, strong\r\nindividuality which characterises them to-day would have been dismissed\r\nwith horror. The colour and texture of men's thought on these subjects\r\nhas undergone a notable transformation. Cosmopolitanism of the old type\r\nis a slain hallucination. Capital in our time is not content to be a\r\npatriot, it is a Jingo. As to labour, if we turn to its politics we find\r\nHerr Bebel declaring that the German socialist is first of all a German,\r\nand Mr Ramsay MacDonald pledging his adherents to support any war\r\nnecessary for the assertion of English prestige. If we turn to its\r\ntheoretical sociology we find the national idea rehabilitated and\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nSuch intellectual reconstructions do not, as a rule, begin in England,\r\nor find in English their characteristic formulæ. Mr Blatchford might\r\nindeed be cited, but it is in the brilliant literature of German Social\r\nDemocracy that the most scientific expression of the new spirit is to be\r\nsought. Truly Marx has been indeed translated. His abstract and\r\netiolated internationalism has been replaced by the warm humanity of\r\nwriters like, say, David or Pernerstorfer. The principle of nationality\r\nis Vindicated by the latter in a noble passage. I quote it from\r\nSombart's \"Socialism and the Social Movement.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Nationality in its highest form is ... a precious possession. It\r\n     is the highest expression of human civilisation in an individual\r\n     form, and mankind is the richer for its appearance. Our purpose is\r\n     not only to see to it that men shall be housed and fed and clothed\r\n     in a manner worthy of human beings, but also that they may become\r\n     humanised by participation in the culture of centuries, that they\r\n     may themselves possess culture and produce it. All culture is\r\n     national. It takes its rise in some special people, and reaches its\r\n     highest form in national character.... Socialism and the national\r\n     idea are thus not opposed to each other. Every attempt to weaken\r\n     the national idea is an attempt to lessen the precious possessions\r\n     of mankind.... Socialism wants to organise, and not disintegrate,\r\n     humanity. But in the organisms of mankind, not individuals, but\r\n     nations are the tissues, and if the whole organism is to remain\r\n     healthy it is necessary for the tissues to be healthy.... The\r\n     peoples, despite the changes they undergo, are everlasting, and\r\n     they add to their own greatness by helping the world upward. And\r\n     so we are at one and the same time good Socialists and good\r\n     Germans.\"\r\n\r\nThis might almost seem to be a rhapsody, but every movement of\r\ncontinental politics in recent times confirms and enforces its plain\r\ntruth. \"The spirit of resurgent nationality,\" as Professor Bury of\r\nCambridge tells us, \"has governed, as one of the most puissant forces,\r\nthe political course of the last century and is still unexhausted.\" It\r\nhas governed not only the West but the East; the twain have met in that\r\ndemand for a constitutional national State which in our day has flamed\r\nup, a fire not to be put out, in Turkey, Persia, Egypt. But it is in\r\nImperial politics that the bouleversement has been most complete. When\r\ncritics now find fault with the structure of the Empire they complain\r\nnot that there is too much Downing Street in it, but that the residual\r\npower of Downing Street-is not visible to the naked eye. To us Irish the\r\nblindness of England to the meaning of her own colonial work is a\r\nmaddening miracle. A wit of the time met Goldsmith at dinner. The\r\nnovelist was a little more disconcerting than usual, a result, let us\r\ncharitably hope, of the excellence of the claret. Afterwards they asked\r\nhis fellow-diner what he thought of the author. \"Well,\" he replied, \"I\r\nbelieve that that man wrote 'The Vicar of Wakefield,' and, let me tell\r\nyou, it takes a lot of believing.\" Similarly when we in Ireland learn\r\nthat Great Britain has founded on the principle of local autonomy an\r\nEmpire on which the sun never sets, we nerve ourselves to an Act of\r\nFaith. It is not inappropriate to observe that a large part of the\r\n\"founding\" was done by Irishmen.\r\n\r\nBut the point of immediate interest lies in this. The foolishness of\r\nEngland in Ireland finds an exact parallel, although on a smaller scale\r\nand for a shorter period, in the early foolishness of England in her own\r\ncolonies. In both cases there is an attempt to suppress individuality\r\nand initiative, to exploit, to bully, to Downing Street-ify. It was a\r\npolicy of Unionism, the sort of Unionism that linked the destiny of the\r\nlady to that of the tiger. The fruits of it were a little bitter in the\r\neating. The colonies in which under the Home Rule regime \"loyalty\" has\r\nblossomed like the rose, were in those days most distressingly disloyal.\r\n\r\nCattle-driving and all manner of iniquities of that order in Canada; the\r\nboycott adopted not as a class, but as a national, weapon in Cape\r\nColony; the Eureka stockade in Australia; Christian De Wet and the crack\r\nof Mausers in the Transvaal--such were the propædeutics to the\r\nestablishment of freedom and the dawn of loyalty in the overseas\r\npossessions. But in this field of government the gods gave England not\r\nonly a great pioneer, Lord Durham, but also the grace to listen to him.\r\nHis Canadian policy set a headline which has been faithfully and\r\nfruitfully copied. Its success was irresistible. Let the \"Cambridge\r\nModern History\" tell the tale of before and after Home Rule in the\r\nDominion:\r\n\r\n     \"Provincial jealousies have dwindled to vanishing point; racial\r\n     antipathies no longer imperil the prosperity of the Dominion;\r\n     religious animosities have lost their mischievous power in a new\r\n     atmosphere of common justice and toleration. Canada, as the direct\r\n     outcome of Confederation, has grown strong, prosperous, energetic.\r\n     The unhappy divisions which prevailed at the beginning of the\r\n     nineteenth century, and which darkened with actual revolt and\r\n     bloodshed the dawn of the Victorian era, are now only a memory. The\r\n     links which bind the Dominion to Great Britain may on paper seem\r\n     slight, but they are resistless. Imperial Federation has still\r\n     great tasks to accomplish within our widely scattered Imperial\r\n     domains, but its success in Canada may be accepted as the pledge of\r\n     its triumph elsewhere. Canada is a nation within the Empire, and in\r\n     Kipling's phrase is 'daughter in her mother's house and mistress in\r\n     her own.'\"\r\n\r\nThis is the authentic harvest of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe \"unity\" of the old regime which, in a Bismarckian phrase, was like\r\npaper pasted over ever-widening cracks, was abandoned. The Separatist\r\nprogramme triumphed. And the outcome? The sham unity of government has\r\nbeen replaced by a real unity of interest, affection and cultural\r\naffinity. We find administrators like Mr Lyttleton, former Tory\r\nSecretary for the Colonies, engaged to-day not in suppressing but in\r\ncelebrating the \"varied individuality\" of the overseas possessions. As\r\nfor the political effects of the change, every English writer repeats of\r\nthe Colonies what Grattan, in other circumstances, said of the Irish:\r\nLoyalty is their foible. There is indeed one notable flaw in the\r\ncolonial parallel. I have spoken as if the claim of the Colonies on foot\r\nof the principle of nationality was comparable to that of Ireland. That\r\nof course was not the case. They were at most nations in the making; she\r\nwas a nation made. Home Rule helped on their growth; in its benign\r\nwarmth Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa have developed\r\nnot only a political complexion characteristic of each but a literature,\r\nan art and even a slang equally characteristic. Ireland, on the other\r\nhand, has manifested throughout her whole history an amazing faculty of\r\nassimilating and nationalising everything that came to her from without.\r\n\r\nThe will to preserve her nationality motived her whole life, especially\r\nin the modern period. The declared dream of Grattan was, as we have\r\nseen, to transform a Protestant colony into an Irish nation. Wolfe Tone\r\nconfessed the same inspiration; Emmet's speech from the dock was that\r\nand nothing else. It was the whole of Davis in thought, and of O'Connell\r\nin action. Isaac Butt yielded to its fascination, and found for it the\r\nwatchword, Home Rule. It was formulated by Parnell in a speech the\r\ncapital passage of which forms the inscription on his monument. It\r\nechoes and re-echoes through the resolutions of every meeting, and\r\nconstitutes for many orators their total stock of political ideas. It\r\nprovides the title of the Irish delegation to Parliament, and is\r\nendorsed at General Election after General Election by a great and\r\nunchanging majority. A people such as this is not to be exterminated. An\r\nideal such as this is not to be destroyed. Recognise the one, sever the\r\nligatures that check the free flow of blood through the veins of the\r\nother, and enrich your federation of autonomous peoples with another\r\nrich individuality. Imitate in Ireland your own wisdom in dealing with\r\nthe Colonies, and the same policy will bear the same harvest. For\r\njustice given the Colonies gave you friendship, as for injustice\r\nstubbornly upheld they had given you hatred. The analogy with Ireland is\r\ncomplete so far as the cards have been played. The same human elements\r\nare there, the same pride, the same anger, the same willingness to\r\nforget anger. Why should the augury fail?\r\n\r\nI can hear in imagination the sniff of the unimaginative reader; I can\r\nfigure to myself his instant dismissal of all these considerations as\r\n\"sentiment.\" Let the word stand, coloured though it is with associations\r\nthat degrade it. But is \"sentiment\" to be ignored in the fixing of\r\nconstitutions? Ruskin asks a pertinent question. What is it after all\r\nbut \"sentiment,\" he inquires, that prevents a man from killing his\r\ngrandmother in time of hunger? Sentiment is the most respectable thing\r\nin human psychology. No one believes in it more thoroughly than your\r\nreactionary Tory. But he wears his heart on his sleeve with a\r\ndifference. He is so greedily patriotic that he would keep all the\r\npatriotism in the world to himself. That he should love his country is\r\nnatural and noble, a theme so high as to be worthy of Mr Kipling or even\r\nMr Alfred Austin himself. That we should love ours is a sort of middle\r\nterm between treason and insanity. It is as if a lover were to insist\r\nthat no poems should be written to any woman except _his_ mistress. It\r\nis as if he were to put the Coercion Act in force against anyone found\r\nshedding tears over the sufferings of any mother except _his_ mother. In\r\nfact it is the sort of domineering thick-headedness that never fails to\r\nproduce disloyalty.\r\n\r\nThe national idea, then, is the foundation of the \"case for Home Rule.\"\r\nIt might indeed be styled the whole case, but this anthem of nationality\r\nmay be transposed into many keys. Translated into terms of ethics it\r\nbecomes that noble epigram of Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman's for which I\r\nwould exchange a whole library of Gladstonian eloquence: \"Good\r\ngovernment is no substitute for self-government.\" In Ireland we have\r\nenjoyed neither. Political subjection has mildewed our destiny, leaf and\r\nstem. But were it not so, had we increased in wealth like Egypt, in\r\npopulation like Poland, the vital argument for autonomy would be neither\r\nweaker nor stronger. Rich or poor, a man must be master of his own fate.\r\nPoor or rich, a nation must be captain of her own soul. In the suburban\r\nroad in which you live there are probably at least a hundred other\r\nhouse-holds. Now if you were all, each suppressing his individuality,\r\nto club together you could build in place of the brick-boxes in which\r\nyou live a magnificent phalanstery. There you could have more air for\r\nyour lungs and more art for your soul, a spacious and a gracious life,\r\ncheaper washing, cheaper food, and a royal kitchen. But you will not do\r\nit. Why? Because it profiteth a man nothing to gain the services of a\r\nParis _maître d'hôtel_ and to lose his own soul. In an attic fourteen\r\nfeet by seven, which he can call his own, a man has room to breathe; in\r\na Renaissance palace, controlled by a committee on which he is in a\r\npermanent minority of one, he has no room to breathe. Home Rulers are\r\nfond of phrasing their programme as a demand on the part of Ireland that\r\nshe shall control the management of her domestic affairs. The language\r\nfits the facts like a glove. The difference between Unionism and Home\r\nRule is the difference between being compelled to live in an\r\nostentatious and lonely hotel and being permitted to live in a simple,\r\nfriendly house of one's own.\r\n\r\nTranslated into terms of administration the gospel of autonomy becomes\r\nthe doctrine of \"the man on the spot.\" That is the Eleven Rule of\r\nImperial Policy, and although it has sometimes been ridden to death, in\r\nfact to murder, as in the Denshawai hangings, it is a sound rule. A man\r\nwho has gone to the trouble of being born, bred, and ordinarily\r\ndomiciled in, say, Kamskatcka is more likely to understand the affairs\r\nof Kamskatcka than a man whose life oscillates daily like a pendulum\r\nbetween Clapham and the Strand. The old natural philosophers accepted\r\nthe theory of _actio distans_, that is to say they assumed that a body\r\ncould act effectively where it was not. This was Unionism in science,\r\nand needless to say it was wrong. In politics it is equally wrong, and\r\nit has been repudiated everywhere except in Ireland. Physical vision is\r\nlimited in range; as the distance increases the vision declines in\r\nclearness, becomes subject to illusion, finally ceases. Now you in\r\nLondon, through mere limitations of human faculty, cannot see us in\r\nDublin. You are trying to govern Ireland in the fashion in which,\r\naccording to Wordsworth, all bad literature has been written, that is to\r\nsay, without your eye on the object. But it is time to have done with\r\nthis stern, long chase of the obvious.\r\n\r\nTranslated into terms of economics the gospel of autonomy becomes the\r\ndoctrine of a \"stake in the country.\" England has, indeed, a stake in\r\nIreland. She has the same interest in seeing Ireland prosperous that a\r\nbootmaker has in learning from his farmer client that the crops are\r\ngood. Each country is in great measure the economic complement of the\r\nother. But if the bootmaker were to insist on having his finger in the\r\nfarmer's pie, the pie, destined for the bootmaker's own appetite, would\r\nnot be improved. If he were to insist on applying to the living cow\r\nthose processes which he applies with such success to the dead leather,\r\nthe cow would suffer and ultimately there would be no boots. Generally\r\nspeaking, each of us improves his own business by declining to mind\r\nanybody else's. Home Rule will give England precisely this chance of\r\nsticking to her last. To Ireland it will come with both hands full of\r\nnew opportunities and new responsibilities.\r\n\r\nTo realise that the national idea in Ireland arouses an emotion, at once\r\nmassive, intense, and enduring, is to understand many derivative\r\nriddles. We are all familiar with the complaint that there is in Ireland\r\ntoo much politics and too little business. Of course there is, and not\r\nonly too little business but too little literature, too little\r\nphilosophy, too little social effort, too little fun. We Nationalists\r\nhave grasped this better and proclaimed it more steadily than any\r\nUnionist. There is as much truth in saying that life begins where\r\npolitics end, as in saying that love begins where love-making ends.\r\nConstitutional freedom is not the fifth act of the social drama in\r\nmodern times, it is rather the prologue, or, better still, the theatre\r\nin which other ideas that move men find an arena for their conflict.\r\nIreland, a little exhausted by her intense efforts of the last thirty\r\nyears, does assuredly need a rest-cure from agitation. But this healing\r\npeace is itself a gift of autonomy. A tooth-ache concentrates the whole\r\nmind on one particular emotion, which is a bad thing, and breeds\r\nprofanity, which is worse. But it is idle to tell a man with a\r\ntooth-ache that what he needs in his life is less cursing and more\r\nbusiness. He cannot work effectively so long as he suffers; the only way\r\nto peace is to cure the tooth-ache. And in order to get rid of politics\r\nin Ireland, you must give Ireland Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE RAVAGES OF UNIONISM (I)\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland, as we have seen, has had the misfortune to provoke many worthy\r\nwriters to a sad debauch of sentimentalism. It has pleased their fancy\r\nespecially to picture her as a sphinx, mysterious, elusive, inscrutable.\r\nIt is impossible to govern her, declare these theorists, because it is\r\nimpossible to understand her. She is the _femme incomprise_ of modern\r\npolitics. Her temperament is a magnet for disaster, her soul a sanctuary\r\nof inviolable secrets. So runs the rhapsody, and many of my own\r\ncountrymen have thought it good strategy to accept and exploit it. They\r\nhave this to urge, indeed, that failure to make oneself understood is\r\ncommonly regarded as a sign of the superior mind. Lord Rosebery, for\r\nexample, has told us that he himself, for all his honey-dropping tongue,\r\nhas never been properly understood. And Hegel, the great German\r\nphilosopher, who was so great a philosopher that we may without\r\nimpropriety mention his name even in the brilliant vicinage of the Earl\r\nof Midlothian, used to sigh: \"Alas! in the whole of my teaching career I\r\nhad but one student who understood my system, and he mis-understood it.\"\r\nThis is all very well in its way, and a climate of incomprehension may\r\nsuit orators and metaphysicians admirably; but it will not do for\r\npolitics. The party or people that fails to make its programme\r\nunderstood is politically incompetent, and Ireland is assuredly safe\r\nfrom any such imputation. She has her spiritual secrets, buried deep in\r\nwhat we may call the subliminal consciousness of the race, and to the\r\ndisclosure of these secrets we may look with confidence for the\r\ninspiration of a new literature. But in politics Ireland has no secrets.\r\nAll her cards are on the table, decipherable at the first glance. Her\r\npolitical demand combines the lucidity of an invoice with the axiomatic\r\nrectitude of the Ten Commandments. There is no doubt about what she\r\nwants, and none about why she ought to have it. In that sense the case\r\nfor Home Rule is made, and this book, having justified its title, ought\r\nto come to an end. But convention prescribes that about the nude contour\r\nof principles there should be cast a certain drapery of details, and\r\nsuch conventions are better obeyed.\r\n\r\nWhere we are to begin is another matter. We are, as has been so often\r\nsuggested, in presence of a situation in which one cannot see the trees\r\nfor the forest. The principle of the government of Ireland is so\r\nintegrally wrong that it is difficult to signalise any one point in\r\nwhich it is more wrong than it is in any other. A timber-chaser, that is\r\nto say a pioneer for a lumber firm, in the Western States of America\r\nonce found himself out of spirits. He decided to go out of life, and\r\nbeing thorough in his ways he left nothing to chance. He set fire to his\r\ncabin, and, mounting the table, noosed his neck to a beam, drank a large\r\nquantity of poison, and, as he kicked over the table, simultaneously\r\nshot himself through the head and drew a razor across his throat. Later\r\non the doctor had to fill in the usual certificate. At \"Cause of Death\"\r\nhe paused, pondered, and at last wrote, \"Causes too numerous to\r\nspecify.\" The fable possesses a certain suggestive value upon which we\r\nneed not enlarge. How, one may well ask, are we to itemise the retail\r\niniquities of a system of government which is itself a wholesale\r\niniquity? But since we must begin somewhere let us begin with the\r\nEconomics of Unionism.\r\n\r\nIn this often-written, and perhaps over-written story there is one\r\nfeature of some little comfort. Whatever quarrel there may be as to\r\ncauses, the facts are not disputed. Pitt and his friends promised that\r\nthe Union would be followed by general prosperity, development of\r\nmanufacturers, and expansion of commerce.\r\n\r\n     \"Among the great and known defects of Ireland,\" he declared in a\r\n     typical statement, \"one of the most prominent features is its want\r\n     of industry and of capital. How are these wants to be supplied but\r\n     by blending more closely with Ireland the industry and capital of\r\n     Great Britain?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a Witches' Promise making smooth the path to damnation. In every\r\npoint in which Pitt had prophesied white the moving finger of history\r\nbegan, from the very day of the Union, to write black. The injury to the\r\nwhole economic tissue of Ireland was immediate, cumulative, in the end\r\ncrushing.\r\n\r\nWe have at hand authoritative figures of the decline collected by\r\nvarious Commissions and private inquirers. Let us note some of these as\r\nsummarised by Monsignor O'Riordan in his remarkable book, \"Catholicism\r\nand Progress\":\r\n\r\n     \"Again, in 1800 there were 91 woollen manufacturers in Dublin and\r\n     4938 hands employed; in 1840 there were only 12 manufacturers, and\r\n     682 hands employed; in 1880, only 3 manufacturers in Dublin and\r\n     around it. In 1800 there were 56 blanket manufacturers in Kilkenny,\r\n     and 3000 hands employed; in 1840 there were 12 manufacturers and\r\n     925 hands employed. In 1800 there were 900 hands employed on\r\n     ratteens and friezes in Roscrea; in 1840 the industry had\r\n     completely disappeared. In 1800 there were 1000 flannel looms in\r\n     County Wicklow; in 1840 there was not one. In 1800 there were 2500\r\n     looms at work in Dublin for the manufacture of silk and poplin; in\r\n     1840 there were only 250. In 1800 there were 27,000 cotton workers\r\n     in Belfast and around it; in 1840 there were only 12,000. In 1800\r\n     there were 61,075 tradesmen in Dublin for the woollen, silk, and\r\n     cotton industries; in 1834 there were only 14,446, and of these\r\n     4412 were idle, showing a decrease of 51,041 in the employed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was, we must add, an increase in other directions. For instance,\r\nwhereas there had been only seven bankruptcies decreed in Dublin in 1799\r\nthere were 125 in 1810. The number of insolvent houses grew in seven\r\nyears from 880 to 4719. These figures are not random but symptomatic. Mr\r\nPitt had promised to blend Ireland with the capital and industry of\r\nGreat Britain; he blended them as the edge of a tomahawk is blended with\r\nthe spattered brains of its victim. We have glanced at the condition of\r\nmanufacture. Lest it should be assumed that the tiller of land at least\r\nhad profited by the Napoleonic Wars, with their consequent high prices,\r\nlet me hasten to add that the Grey Commission, reporting in 1836, had to\r\ninform the Government that 2,385,000 persons, nearly one-third of the\r\npopulation, were \"in great need of food.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Their habitations,\" the Report proceeds, \"are wretched hovels;\r\n     several of the family sleep together on straw, or on the bare\r\n     ground, sometimes with a blanket, sometimes not even so much to\r\n     cover them. Their food commonly consists of dry potatoes; and with\r\n     these they are at times so scantily supplied as to be obliged to\r\n     stint themselves to one spare meal in the day.... They sometimes\r\n     get a herring or a little milk, but they never get meat except at\r\n     Christmas, Easter, and Shrovetide.\"\r\n\r\nBut a truce to these dismal chronicles. The _post hoc_ may be taken as\r\nestablished; was it a _propter hoc_? Was the Union the cause as well as\r\nthe antecedent of this decay? No economist, acquainted with the facts,\r\ncan fail to answer in the affirmative. The causal connection between two\r\nrealities could not be more manifest. Let us examine it very briefly.\r\n\r\nI begin of necessity with the principle of freedom, for freedom is the\r\ndominating force in economic life. No instance can be cited of a modern\r\npeople of European civilisation that ever prospered while held\r\npolitically in subjection.\r\n\r\n     \"All history,\" writes Professor Marshall of Cambridge, the doyen of\r\n     Political Economy in England, \"is full of the record of\r\n     inefficiency caused in varying degrees by slavery, serfdom, and\r\n     other forms of civil and political oppression and repression.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of Union was, as has been said, one of those spiritual outrages\r\nwhich, in their reactions, are like lead poured into the veins. It\r\nlowered the vital resources of Ireland. It made hope an absentee, and\r\nenterprise an exile. That was its first-fruits of disaster.\r\n\r\nThese commonplaces of the gospel of freedom \"for which Hampden died in\r\nthe field and Sidney on the scaffold\" will possibly appear to their\r\nmodern descendants mystical, sentimental, and remote from real life. For\r\nthere is no one in the world so ready as your modern Englishman to deny\r\nthat he is a man in order to prove that he is a business-man.\r\nFortunately we can establish for this strange being, who has thus\r\nindecently stripped himself of humanity, and establish in very clear\r\nand indisputable fashion the cash nexus between Unionism and decay. The\r\nargument is simple.\r\n\r\nThe Union came precisely in the period in which capital was beginning to\r\ndominate the organisation of industry. The Union denuded Ireland of the\r\ncapital which would have enabled her to transform the technique of her\r\nmanufactures, and so maintain the ground won under Grattan's Parliament.\r\nThe channels through which this export of capital proceeded were\r\nabsenteeism and over-taxation.\r\n\r\nThe first statement in this paragraph of plaint calls for no\r\nelaboration. Arnold Toynbee took as the terminal dates of the Industrial\r\nRevolution the years 1760 and 1830. The last generation of the\r\neighteenth century brought to birth the great inventions, but it was the\r\nfirst generation of the nineteenth that founded on them large scale\r\nproduction, and settled the structure of modern industry. Not without\r\nprofound disturbance and incalculable suffering was the new system\r\nestablished in England; the story may be read in the pages of Marx,\r\nCunningham, Cooke Taylor, or any of the economic historians. But, for\r\nall the blood and tears, it was established. Insulated from the\r\ncontinental turmoil, served by her Titanic bondsmen coal and iron,\r\nEngland was able to defeat the Titan, Napoleon. Now it is idle to deny\r\nthat this period would under any government have strained Ireland, as\r\nthe phrase goes, to the pin of her collar. But the Union made her task\r\nimpossible. Lord Castlereagh was quite right in pointing to the\r\naccumulation of capital as the characteristic advantage of England.\r\nThrough centuries of political freedom that process had gone on without\r\ninterruption. Ireland, on the contrary, had been scientifically pillaged\r\nby the application to her of the \"colonial system\" from 1663 to 1779; I\r\ndeliberately exclude the previous waste of war and confiscation. She had\r\nbut twenty years of commercial freedom, and, despite her brilliant\r\nsuccess in that period, she had not time to accumulate capital to any\r\ngreat extent. But Grattan's Parliament had shown itself extraordinarily\r\nastute and steady of purpose in its economic policy. Had its guidance\r\ncontinued--conservative taxation, adroit bounties, and that close\r\nscrutiny and eager discussion of the movements of industry which stands\r\nrecorded in its Journal--the manufactures of Ireland would have\r\nweathered the storm. But the luck was as usual against her. Instead of\r\nwise leadership from Dublin the gods decreed that she should have for\r\nportion the hard indifference and savage taxation of Westminster.\r\nReduced to the position of a tributary nation, stripped of the capital\r\nthat would have served as a commissariat of advance in that crucial\r\nstruggle, she went down.\r\n\r\nI am not to make here the case for Ireland in respect of over-taxation.\r\nIt was made definitely in the Report of the Childers Commission, a\r\ndocument which no Englishman reads, lest in coming to the light he\r\nshould have his sins too sharply rebuked. It has been developed and\r\nclarified in many speeches and essays and in some books. To grasp it is\r\nto find your road to Damascus on the Irish Question. But for the moment\r\nwe are concerned with but one aspect, namely, the export of capital from\r\nIreland as a result of the Union, and the economic reactions of that\r\nprocess. Since we are to use moderation of speech and banish all\r\nrhetoric from these pages, one is at a loss to characterise Union\r\narrangements and post-Union finance. Let it suffice to say that they\r\ncombined the moral outlook of Captain Kidd with the mathematical\r\ntechnique of a super-bucket-shop. From the first Great Britain robbed\r\nthe Irish till; from the first she skimmed the cream off the Irish milk,\r\nand appropriated it for her own nourishment. One has a sort of gloomy\r\npride in remembering that although cheated in all these transactions we\r\nwere not duped. Mr Foster, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons--in\r\nthose days the Speaker actually spoke, a whimsical Irish custom--tore\r\nthe cloak off Lord Castlereagh's strutting statesmanship, and laid bare\r\nhis real motives. Speaking on the first Union proposal in 1799 he said:\r\n\r\n     \"But the noble Lord has told us the real motives of this scheme of\r\n     Union, and I thank him for stating them so fairly. Ireland, he\r\n     says, must contribute to every war, and the Minister won't trust to\r\n     interest, affection, or connection for guiding her conduct. _He\r\n     must have her purse within his own grasp_. While three hundred men\r\n     hold it in Ireland he cannot put his hand into it, they are out of\r\n     his reach, but let a hundred of you carry it over and lay it at his\r\n     feet, and then he will have full and uncontrolled power.\"\r\n\r\nSo it came about. Even before the Union Grattan's Parliament had, of its\r\nown free will and out of an extravagant loyalty, run itself into debt\r\nfor the first time to help England against France. But, as Foster\r\nindicated, the Irish members felt that they were coming to the end of\r\ntheir resources. They were about to call a halt, and so the Union became\r\na necessary ingredient of Pitt's foreign policy. By it Ireland was\r\nswept into the vortex of his anti-French hysteria, and of what Mr\r\nHartley Withers so properly styles his \"reckless finance.\" In sixteen\r\nyears she was brought to the edge of bankruptcy. Between 1801 and 1817\r\nher funded debt was increased from £28,541,157 to £112,684,773, an\r\naugmentation of nearly 300 per cent. In the first fifteen years\r\nfollowing the Union she paid in taxes £78,000,000 as against £31,000,000\r\nin the last fifteen years preceding the Union. After the amalgamation of\r\nthe Exchequers in 1817 the case becomes clearer. In 1819-20, for\r\ninstance, the revenue contributed by Ireland was £5,256,564, of which\r\nonly £1,564,880 was spent in Ireland, leaving a tribute for Great\r\nBritain of £3,691,684. For 1829-30 the tribute was £4,156,576.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how things stood with regard to absenteeism. This had\r\nexisted before the Union'; indeed, if the curious reader will turn to\r\nJohnson's \"Dictionary\" he will find it damned in a definition. But it\r\nwas enormously intensified by the shifting of the centre of gravity of\r\nIrish politics, industry, and fashion from Dublin to London. The memoirs\r\nof that day abound in references to an exodus which has left other and\r\nmore material evidence in those fallen and ravaged mansions which now\r\nconstitute the worst slums of our capital city.\r\n\r\nOne figure may be cited by way of illustration. Before the Union \"98\r\nPeers, and a proportionate number of wealthy Commoners\" lived in Dublin.\r\nThe number of resident Peers in 1825 was twelve. At present, as I learn\r\nfrom those who read the sixpenny illustrateds, there is one. But when\r\nthey abandoned Ireland they did not leave their rents behind. And it was\r\na time of rising rents; according to Toynbee they at least doubled\r\nbetween 1790 and 1833. Precise figures are not easily arrived at, but Mr\r\nD'Alton in his \"History of the County Dublin,\" a book quite innocent of\r\npolitics, calculates that the absentee rental of Ireland was in 1804 not\r\nless than £3,000,000, and in 1830 not less than £4,000,000, an\r\nunder-estimate. If we average these figures over the period we find that\r\nduring the first thirty years of Union, that is to say during the most\r\ncritical phase of the Industrial Revolution, not less than £105,000,000\r\nof Irish capital was \"exported\" from Ireland to Great Britain through\r\nthe channel of absenteeism.\r\n\r\nAveraging the figures of the taxation-tribute in similar fashion, and\r\ntaking the lowest estimates, I am unable to reach a less total than\r\n£120,000,000 for the same period. In other words, the effect of the\r\nUnion was to withdraw from Ireland during the thirty years that settled\r\nthe economic structure of modern industry not less than _£_225,000,000.\r\nLet me draw the argument together in words which I have used elsewhere,\r\nand which others can no doubt easily better:\r\n\r\n     \"We have heard, in our day, a long-drawn denunciation of a Liberal\r\n     government on the score that it had, by predatory taxation, driven\r\n     English capital out of the country, and compromised the industrial\r\n     future of England. We have seen in our own day gilt-edged\r\n     securities, bank, insurance, railway, and brewery shares in Great\r\n     Britain, brought toppling down by a Tory waste of _£_250,000,000 on\r\n     the Boer War. We know that in economic history effects are, in a\r\n     notable way, cumulative; so clearly marked is the line of\r\n     continuity as to lead a great writer to declare that there is not a\r\n     nail in all England that could not be traced back to savings made\r\n     before the Norman Conquest. A hundred instances admonish us that,\r\n     in industrial life, nothing fails like failure. When we put all\r\n     these considerations together, and give them a concrete\r\n     application, can we doubt that in over-taxation and the withdrawal\r\n     of capital we have the prime _causa causans_ of the decay of\r\n     Ireland under the Union?\"\r\n\r\nIn this wise did Pitt \"blend Ireland with the industry and capital of\r\nGreat Britain.\" Cupped by his finance she gave the venal blood of her\r\nindustry to strengthen the predominant partner, and to help him to\r\nexclude for a time from these islands that pernicious French Democracy\r\nin which all states and peoples have since found redemption. Such was\r\nthe first chapter in the Economics of Unionism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RAVAGES OF UNIONISM (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader cares to push forward the line of thought suggested in the\r\npreceding pages and to submit it to a concrete test he can do so without\r\ndifficulty. He has but to compare the post-Union history of linen with\r\nthat of cotton. Linen in Ireland had been a perfect type of the\r\nState-created, spoon-fed industry characteristic of the period of\r\nmercantilism. Within certain limits--such as the steady resolve to\r\nconfine it, in point of religion, to Protestants, and, in point of\r\ngeography, to Ulster--it had behind it at the Union a century of\r\nencouragement. It is calculated that between 1700 and 1800 it had\r\nreceived bounties, English and Irish, totalling more than,£2,500,000. In\r\nother words it had a chance to accumulate capital. Even linen declined\r\nafter the Union partly from the direct effects of that measure, partly\r\nfrom the growing intensity of the Industrial Revolution. But the\r\ncapital accumulated, the commercial good name established under native\r\ngovernment carried the manufacturers through. These were able towards\r\n1830 to introduce the new machinery and the new processes, and to\r\nweather the tempest of competition. Cotton, on the other hand, was a\r\nvery recent arrival. It had developed very rapidly, and in 1800 gave\r\npromise of supplanting linen. But the weight of capital told more and\r\nmore as changes in the technique of transportation and production\r\nushered in our modern world. Lacking the solid reserves of its rival,\r\ninvolved in all the exactions that fall on a tributary nation, the\r\ncotton manufacture of Ireland lost ground, lost heart, and disappeared.\r\nBut let us resume the parable. If the \"business man\" responds to\r\ncapital, he will certainly not be obtuse to the appeal of coal. In this\r\nfeeder of industry Ireland was geologically at a disadvantage, and it\r\nwas promised that the free trade with Great Britain inaugurated by the\r\nUnion would \"blend\" with her the resources of the latter country. Did\r\nshe obtain free trade in coal? Miss Murray, a Unionist, in her\r\n\"Commercial Relations between England and Ireland\" tells the story in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     \"Coals again had hitherto been exported from Great Britain at a\r\n     duty of gd. per ton; this duty was to cease but the Irish import\r\n     duty on coal was to be made perpetual, and that at a time when all\r\n     coasting duties in England and Scotland had been abolished. Dublin\r\n     especially would suffer from this arrangement, for the duty there\r\n     on coals imported was is. 8-4/5d. per ton, while that in the rest\r\n     of Ireland was only 9-1/2d. This was because a local duty of 1s.\r\n     per ton existed in Dublin for the internal improvement of the city;\r\n     this local duty was blended by the Union arrangements with the\r\n     general duty on the article, and its perpetual continuance was thus\r\n     enforced. All this shows how little Irish affairs were understood\r\n     in England.\"\r\n\r\nBut was it a failure of the English intellect or a lapse of the English\r\nwill? Except through the Platonic intuition which reduces all sin to\r\nterms of ignorance I cannot accept the former explanation. What is\r\ncertain is that there was no lack of contemporary protest. There existed\r\nin Dublin in 1828 a Society for the Improvement of Ireland, an active\r\nbody which included in its membership the Lord Mayor (a high Tory, of\r\ncourse), Lord Cloncurry, and a long list of notable names such as\r\nLatouche, Sinclair, Houghton, Leader, Grattan, Smith O'Brien, George\r\nMoore, and Daniel O'Connell. In the year mentioned the Society appointed\r\na number of committees to report on the state of Irish agriculture,\r\ncommerce, and industry. One of these reports is full of information\r\ntouching the drain of capital from the country, and its consequent\r\ndecay, as registered by contemporaries; we shall learn from another how\r\nthings stood with regard to coal. At the time of the Union the Irish\r\nParliament granted a bounty of 2s. per ton on Irish coal carried\r\ncoastwise to Dublin, and levied a duty of 10-1/2d. per ton on coal\r\nimported from Great Britain. The effect of the Union was to abolish the\r\nbounty and double the levy on imports. Writing twenty-eight years later\r\nthe Committee summarise in a brief passage the disastrous effects of a\r\npolicy, so foolish and so unjust. The last sentence opens up sombre\r\nvistas to any student of economic history:\r\n\r\n     \"Severe, however, as the operation of the coal duty in arresting\r\n     the progress of manufacture may have been in other parts of\r\n     Ireland, in Dublin, under the circumstances to which your Committee\r\n     are about to call the attention of the Society, it has produced all\r\n     the effects of actual prohibition, all the mischiefs of the most\r\n     rigorous exclusion. It is a singular circumstance that, in the\r\n     metropolis of the country, possessing local advantages in respect\r\n     to manufactures and facilities for trade with the interior,\r\n     superior, probably, to any other city or town in this portion of\r\n     the empire, with a population excessive as to the means of\r\n     employment, in a degree which probably has not a parallel in\r\n     Europe, _there is not a factory for the production of either silk,\r\n     linen, cotton, or woollen manufactures which is worked or propelled\r\n     by a steam engine_.\"\r\n\r\nThe writers go on to ask for the repeal of the local duty on coal in\r\nDublin, and to suggest that the necessary revenue should be raised by a\r\nduty on spirits. This course Belfast had been permitted to follow--one\r\nof the numberless make-weights thrown into the scale so steadily on the\r\nside of the Protestant North. In my part of the country the people used\r\nto say of any very expert thief: \"Why, he'd steal the fire out of your\r\ngrate.\" Under the Union arrangements Great Britain stole the fire out of\r\nthe grate of Ireland. And having so dealt with capital and coal the\r\npredominant partner next proceeded by a logical development to muddle\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThe Drummond Commission, appointed in 1836 to consider the question of\r\nrailway construction in Ireland, issued a report in 1838 which\r\npractically recommended public and not private enterprise as appropriate\r\n\"to accomplish so important a national object.\" What came after is best\r\nrelated in the official terminology of the Scotter Commission of\r\n1906-10:\r\n\r\n     \"This report was presented in July 1838, and early in the\r\n     following year a great public meeting, held in Dublin, passed a\r\n     resolution that inasmuch as an adequate system of railways could\r\n     not be constructed by private capital, the Government should be\r\n     urged to take the work into its own hands, thereby saving the cost\r\n     of Private Bill legislation. Promises were also made that the lands\r\n     necessary for railway construction would be given free of cost.\r\n     Similar resolutions were adopted at another meeting held about the\r\n     same time in the north of Ireland. In addition, an address to the\r\n     Queen was presented by a number of Irish Peers, headed by the Duke\r\n     of Leinster, praying that action might be taken on the Drummond\r\n     Commission Report.\"\r\n\r\nThe government saw the light, and proceeded to sin against it. They\r\nembodied the Dublin programme in resolutions which were adopted by the\r\nHouse of Commons in March 1839, and they then abruptly abandoned the\r\nwhole business. The last chance was not yet lost. During the Great\r\nFamine of 1847 the Opposition proposed to raise, £16,000,000 by State\r\nloans for the construction of railways as relief works. A suggestion so\r\nsane could not hope to pass. It was in fact rejected; the starving\r\npeasants were set to dig large holes and fill them up again, and to\r\nbuild bad roads leading nowhere. And instead of a national railway\r\nsystem Ireland was given private enterprise with all its waste and all\r\nits clash of interests.\r\n\r\nThe two most conspicuous gifts of Unionism to Ireland have been, as all\r\nthe world knows, poverty and police. Soon after 1830, that is to say\r\nwhen the first harvest of government from Westminster was ripe to the\r\nsickle, Irish destitution had assumed what politicians call men-acing\r\nproportions. One person in every three of the population never had any\r\nother alimentary experience than the difference between hunger and\r\nstarvation. In these circumstances a Royal Commission was appointed to\r\nconsider the advisability of extending the English Poor Law to Ireland.\r\nTheir report is a pioneer document in the development of economic\r\nthought. Just as the Railway Commission a few years later was to give\r\nthe watchword of the future, nationalisation, so the Poor Law Commission\r\ngave within its province the watchword of the future, prevention before\r\nrelief. They pointed the contrast between the two countries. I quote the\r\nwords of the later Irish Poor Law Commission of 1903-6:\r\n\r\n     \"Having regard to the destitution and poverty that were prevalent\r\n     in Ireland owing to want of employment, the Royal Commissioners in\r\n     their Report of 1836 came to the conclusion that the English\r\n     workhouse system would be unsuitable for Ireland, because after\r\n     unchecked demoralisation by profuse out-door relief _in England,\r\n     the Work-house system was devised in order to make the lazy and\r\n     idle seek ordinary employment which could be got. The situation in\r\n     Ireland was, on the contrary, one in which the able-bodied and\r\n     healthy were willing and anxious to work for any wages, even for\r\n     twopence a day, but were unable to obtain such or any employment_.\"\r\n\r\nIreland at the end of a generation of Unionism was suffering, as the\r\ncommissioners proceed to point out, not from over-population, but from\r\nunder-development. They tabled two sets of recommendations. The relief\r\nprogramme advised compulsory provision for the sick, aged, infirm,\r\nlunatics, and others incapable of work; in all essential matters it\r\nanticipated in 1836 that Minority Report which to the England of 1912\r\nstill seems extravagantly humane. The prevention programme outlined a\r\nscheme for the development of Irish resources. Including, as it did,\r\ndemands for County Fiscal Boards, agricultural education, better\r\ncottages for the labourers, drainage, reclamation, and changes in the\r\nland system, it has been a sort of lucky bag into which British\r\nministers have been dipping without acknowledgment ever since. But the\r\nreport itself was, like the Railway Report, too sane and too Irish to\r\nstand a chance. There was sent over from England a Mr Nicholls, who,\r\nafter a six weeks flutter through the country, devised the Poor Law\r\nSystem under which we still labour. Mr Nicholls afterwards became Sir\r\nGeorge, and when he died it is probable that a statue was erected to\r\nhim. If that is so the inscription must always remain inadequate until\r\nthis is added: \"Having understood all about Ireland in six weeks he gave\r\nher, as the one thing needful to redeem her, the workhouse.\"\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the capital exploit of the Economics of Unionism was its\r\ndealing with the problem of land tenure. I shrink from inviting the\r\nreader into the desert of selfishness and stupidity which constitutes\r\nEnglish policy, in this regard, from the Union to the triumph of the\r\nLand League. Let him study it at large in Davitt's \"Fall of Feudalism.\"\r\nWe are not concerned here to revive that calamitous pageant. Our\r\ninterest is of another kind, namely to signalise the malign influence\r\nintroduced into the agrarian struggle by government from Westminster as\r\nagainst government from Dublin. Even had Grattan's Parliament remained,\r\nthe battle for the land would have had to go forward; for that\r\nParliament was an assembly controlled by landlords who, for the most\r\npart, believed as strongly in the sacredness of rent as they did in the\r\nsacredness of nationality. But by the Union the conflict was embittered\r\nand befouled. The landlords invented their famous doctrine of\r\nconditional loyalty. They bargained with Great Britain to the effect\r\nthat, if they were permitted to pillage their tenantry, they would in\r\nreturn uphold and maintain British rule in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was the old picture with which M. Paul-Dubois has acquainted us, that\r\nof the \"Garrison\" kneeling to England on the necks of the Irish poor. In\r\nthis perversion, which under autonomy would have been impossible, we\r\nfind the explanation of the extreme savagery of Union land policy in\r\nIreland. Its extreme, its bat-eyed obtuseness is to be explained in\r\nanother way. Souchon in his introduction to the French edition of\r\nPhilippovich, the great Austrian economist, observes with great truth\r\nthat England has not even yet developed any sort of _Agrarpolitik_, that\r\nis to say any systematic Economics of Agriculture. In the early\r\nnineteenth century her own land problems were neglected, and her\r\npolitical leaders were increasingly dominated by an economic gospel of\r\nshopkeepers and urban manufacturers. Forced into the context of\r\nagrarian life such a gospel was bound to manifest itself as one of folly\r\nand disaster.\r\n\r\nIf we put these two elements together we are enabled to understand why\r\nthe Union land policy in Ireland was such a portentous muddle and\r\nscandal. In 1829 the question assumed a fresh urgency, in consequence of\r\nthe eviction campaign which followed the disfranchisement of the small\r\nholders under Catholic Emancipation. That Irish opinion, which in an\r\nIrish Parliament would have had its way, began to grapple with the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nBetween 1829 and 1858 twenty-three Irish Land Reform Bills were\r\nintroduced in the House of Commons; every one was rejected. In the same\r\nperiod thirty-five Coercion Bills were introduced; every one was passed.\r\nSo it began, so it continued, until at last Irish opinion did in some\r\nmeasure prevail. The Westminster Parliament clapped the \"agitators\" into\r\nprison, and while they were at work breaking stones stole their\r\nprogramme.... But I have promised to spare the reader the detailed\r\nhideousness of this Inferno, and this section must close without a word\r\nsaid about that miserable triad, famine, eviction, and emigration. What\r\nmay be called the centre of relevancy lies elsewhere. We have been\r\nconcerned to show how Unionism, having wrecked the whole manufacturing\r\neconomy of Ireland, went on, at its worst, to wreck, at its best, to\r\nrefuse to save, its whole agricultural economy.\r\n\r\nBut why recall all this \"dead history\"? For two reasons: first, because\r\nit illustrates the fundamental wrongness of Unionism; secondly, because\r\nit is not dead.\r\n\r\nOn the first point no better authority can be found than Mr W.A.S.\r\nHewins, the intellect of Tariff Reform. The differences between England\r\nand Ireland, he writes in his introduction to Miss Murray's book, are of\r\n\"an organic character.\" In that phrase is concentrated the whole biology\r\nof Home Rule. Every organism must suffer and perish unless its external\r\ncircumstances echo its inner law of development. The sin of the Union\r\nwas that it imposed on Ireland from without a sort of spiked\r\nstrait-jacket which could have no effect but to squeeze the blood and\r\nbreath out of every interest in the country. What was meat to England\r\nwas poison to Ireland, and even honest Englishmen, hypnotised by the\r\neconomists of the day, were unable to perceive this plain truth. Let me\r\ngive another illustration. The capital exploit of Union Economics was,\r\nas has been said, its dealing with the land question, but perhaps its\r\nmost pathetic fallacy was the policy with which it met the Great Famine.\r\nNow the singular thing about this famine is that during it there was no\r\nscarcity of food in Ireland; there was only a shortage of potatoes.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1847 alone,\" writes Mr Michael Davitt in his \"Fall of\r\n     Feudalism,\" \"food to the value of £44,958,000 sterling was grown in\r\n     Ireland according to the statistical returns for that year. But a\r\n     million of people died for want of food all the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation is obvious: the peasants grew potatoes to feed\r\nthemselves, they raised corn to pay their rents. A temporary suspension\r\nof rent-payments and the closing of the ports would have saved the great\r\nbody of the people. But the logic of Unionism worked on other lines. The\r\ngovernment opened the ports, cheapened corn, and made rents harder to\r\npay. At the same time they passed a new Coercion Act, and reorganised\r\nthe police on its present basis to ensure that rents should be paid. To\r\nthe wisdom of this policy, history is able to call witnesses by the\r\nmillion--unhappily however it has to call them from famine graveyards,\r\nand the waste womb of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis essential wrongness of Unionism, so amply illustrated in every\r\nyear of its working, continues. But at least, our bluff Englishman\r\nurges, the dead past can be suffered to bury those crimes and blunders\r\nof Unionism which you have enumerated. Let us start with a clean slate.\r\nNow, as will have been gathered from a previous chapter, we recognise in\r\nthis invitation an accent of soundness. We modern Home Rulers desire\r\nabove all to be loyal to the century in which we live. We are sick of\r\nthat caricature which depicts Ireland as the mad heroine of a sort of\r\nperpetual suttee, in which all the interests of the present are\r\nimmolated on the funeral-pyre of the past. But let us come closer to\r\nthings. How do you clean a slate except by liquidating the debts of\r\nwhich it keeps the record? The late Vicomte de Voguë wrote an admirable\r\nnovel, \"Les Morts qui Parlent.\" The dead are always speaking; you cannot\r\nstop their strong eloquence with a mouthful of clay. The \"business man\"\r\nthinks no doubt that the Napoleonic War is no more than Hecuba to him,\r\nor he to Hecuba. But he pays annual tribute to it, for he has to make\r\nannual provision for the £600,000,000 which it added to the National\r\nDebt. And just as Mr Pitt's foreign policy is in that respect a living\r\nreality of our own time, so also, but in a much graver form, are the\r\npast depredations and ineptitudes of Unionism living realities in the\r\npresent economy of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe ruling fallacy of the English mind on these matters consists in the\r\nassumption that the mere repeal of an old oppression restores a people\r\nto the _status quo ante_. In the case of Ireland the old oppressions\r\nhave not been repealed except in two or three points, but even if they\r\nhad been wholly cancelled it would be absurd to expect immediate\r\nrecovery from their effects. If you have been beating a man on the head\r\nwith a bludgeon for half an hour, and then leave off, there is no sense\r\nin saying to him: \"There, I have given over bludgeoning you. Why on\r\nearth don't you get up, and skip about like me?\" If you have been\r\nrobbing a man's till for ten years, and then decide--by the way you have\r\nnot yet decided--to leave off, there is no sense in saying to him: \"Why\r\nthe devil are you always hard up? Look at me doing the same sort of\r\nbusiness as you on absolutely equal terms, and I'm able to keep two\r\nmotor-cars and six servants.\" But that is precisely what is said to us.\r\nYou are eternally expecting from Ireland new miracles of renaissance.\r\nBut although she does possess recuperative powers, hardly to be\r\nparalleled, even she must have time to slough the corruptions of the\r\npast. You cannot, as some Englishmen imagine, cancel six centuries\r\nbefore breakfast. Your Penal Laws, for instance, have been long since\r\nstruck out of the Statute Book, but they have not yet been eliminated\r\nfrom social habitudes or from certain areas of commercial life.\r\n\r\nYou began to tax Ireland beyond her capacity in 1801, and you are still\r\novertaxing her. In the interval you withdraw from her economic life a\r\ntribute of not less than £325,000,000. You broke her industrial\r\ntradition, injured her credit, depressed her confidence. You forced upon\r\nher a fiscal system devised to suit your needs in utter contempt of\r\nhers. To clean that slate you must first, by some measure of\r\nrestitution, clean your conscience. And when that has been done you will\r\nhave to wait for the curative effects of time to undo the Economics of\r\nUnionism.\r\n\r\nYou suffered landlordism to devastate Ireland unchecked. The capital\r\nthat should have gone to enrich and develop the soil was squeezed out of\r\nit in rack-rents, largely absentee. The whole agricultural economy of\r\nthe country was stricken with a sort of artificial anæmia. Then very\r\nlate in the day you enact in shreds and fragments a programme of reform\r\nproposed half a century before by the leaders of the Irish people.\r\nTo-day rural Ireland is convalescent, but it is absurd to rate her if\r\nshe does not at once manifest all the activities of robust health. It is\r\neven more absurd to expect her to glow with gratitude.\r\n\r\nYou muddled our whole system of transportation; your muddle stands\r\nto-day in all its ruinous largeness unamended, and, it may be, beyond\r\namendment. You muddled the Poor Law; and, in the workhouses which you\r\nthrust upon us, 8000 children are year by year receiving on their lives\r\nthe brand of degradation. You marred education, perverting it into a\r\ndiscipline of denationalisation, and that virus has not yet been\r\nexpelled.\r\n\r\nWhat economic, what intellectual problem in Ireland have you not marred\r\nand muddled, England, my England (as the late Mr W.E. Henley used to\r\nsay)? You have worsened the maledictions of the Bible. The sins of\r\n_your_ fathers will lie as a _damnosa hæreditas_, a damnable heritage,\r\nupon the mortgaged shoulders of _our_ children. It is better, as Plato\r\ntaught, to suffer injustice than to inflict it. In the light of that\r\nethical principle you are long since judged and condemned. But with the\r\ncustomary luck of England you are allowed what others were not allowed,\r\nthe opportunity of penitence and reform. The messengers of the new\r\ngospel are at your doors, offering you in return for the plain rudiments\r\nof justice not only forgiveness but friendship. It is for you to accept\r\nor reject. We, the Irish, whom you have wronged, look to your decision\r\nwith interest rather than with concern. Why should we be concerned? Our\r\nflag has been an Aaron's serpent to swallow yours. Your policies, your\r\nambitions, your administrations have passed by us like the transient and\r\nembarrassed phantoms that they were. We remain. All the roads lead to\r\nRome, and all the years to retribution. This is your year; you have met\r\nthe messengers on your threshold. Your soul is in your own wardship. But\r\nyet we cannot wholly separate your destiny from ours. Dedicated as we\r\nare to the general progress of humanity and to all the generosities of\r\nlife, we await expectantly your election between the good and the evil\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HALLUCINATION OF \"ULSTER\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUlster Unionism, in the leaders, is not so much a programme of ideas as\r\na demand for domination. In the rank and file it is largely a phenomenon\r\nof hysteria. I do not know whether my readers have ever participated in\r\nan agreeable game known as odd man out. Each player tosses a penny, and\r\nwhoever disagrees with the rest, showing a head to their tails or vice\r\nversa, captures the pool. Such is in all essential particulars the\r\n\"Ulster Question.\" We find ourselves there in presence of a minority\r\nwhich, on the sole ground that it is a minority, claims that in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland it shall be not merely secure but supreme. Sir\r\nEdward Carson as odd man out (and I do not deny that he is odd enough\r\nfor anything) is to be Dictator of Ireland. If eighty-four Irish\r\nconstituencies declare for Home Rule, and nineteen against Home Rule,\r\nthen, according to the mathematics of Unionism, the Noes have it. In\r\ntheir non-Euclidean geometry the part is always greater than the whole.\r\nIn their unnatural history the tail always wags the dog. On the plane of\r\npolitics it is not necessary to press the case against \"Ulster\" any\r\nfarther than that. Even majorities have their rights. If a plurality of\r\nnine to two is not sufficient to determine policy and conduct business\r\nin a modern nation, then there is no other choice except anarchy, or\r\nrather an insane atomism. Not merely every party, but every household\r\nand, in last resort, every individual will end as a Provisional\r\nGovernment. Separatism of this type is a very ecstasy of nonsense, and\r\nnone of my readers will think so cheaply of his own intelligence as to\r\nstay to discuss it. It is in other terms that we must handle the problem\r\nof \"Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nThe existence in certain nooks and corners of Ireland of a democratic\r\nvote hostile to Home Rule is, let us confess, a conundrum. But it is a\r\nconundrum of psychology rather than of politics. It may seem rude to say\r\nso, but Orangeism consists mainly of a settled hallucination and an\r\nannual brainstorm. No one who has not been present at a Twelfth of July\r\nprocession can realise how completely all its manifestations belong to\r\nthe life of hysteria and not to that of reason. M. Paul-Dubois, whom we\r\nmay summon out of a cloud of witnesses, writes of them as \"demagogic\r\norgies with a mixed inspiration of Freemasonry and the Salvation Army.\"\r\nThe Twelfth of July is, or rather was, for its fine furies are now much\r\nabated, a savage carnival comparable only to the corroborees of certain\r\nprimitive tribes.\r\n\r\n     \"A monster procession,\" continues M. Paul-Dubois, \"marches through\r\n     Belfast, as through every town and village of Orange Ulster, ending\r\n     up with a vast meeting at which the glories of William of Orange\r\n     and the reverses of James II. are celebrated in song.... Each\r\n     'lodge' sends its delegation to the procession with banners and\r\n     drums. On the flags are various devices: 'Diamond Heroes,' 'True\r\n     Blues,' 'No Pope.' The participants give themselves over to\r\n     character dances, shouting out their favourite songs: 'The Boyne\r\n     Water' and 'Croppies Lie Down.' The chief part is played by the\r\n     drummers, the giants of each 'lodge,' who with bared arms beat\r\n     their drums with holy fury, their fists running with blood, until\r\n     the first drum breaks and many more after it, until in the evening\r\n     they fall half-dead in an excess of frenzy.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the laboratory in which the mind of Orange Ulster is prepared to\r\nface the tasks of the twentieth century. Barbaric music, the ordinary\r\nallowance of drum to fife being three to one, ritual dances, King\r\nWilliam on his white horse, the Scarlet Woman on her seven hills, a\r\ngrand parade of dead ideas and irrelevant ghosts called up in wild\r\nspeeches by clergymen and politicians--such is Orangeism in its full\r\nheat of action. Can we, with this key to its intellectual history, be\r\nreally astonished that Shankhill Road should move all its life in a red\r\nmist of superstition. The North of Ireland abounds in instances, trivial\r\nand tragic, of this obsession. Here it is the case of the women of a\r\ncertain town who, in order to prevent their children from playing in a\r\ndangerous swamp close by, have taught them that there are \"wee Popes\" in\r\nit. There it is a case of man picked up, maimed and all but unconscious\r\nafter an accident, screwing up his lips to utter one last \"To Hell with\r\nthe Pope!\" before he dies. I remember listening in Court to the\r\nexamination of an old Orangeman who had been called as a witness to the\r\npeaceable disposition of a friend of his. \"What sort of man,\" asked the\r\ncounsel, \"would you say Jamie Williamson is?\" \"A quiet, decent man.\" \"Is\r\nhe the sort of man that would be likely to be breaking windows?\" \"No man\r\nless likely.\" \"Is he the sort of man that you would expect to find at\r\nthe head of a mob shouting, 'To Hell with the Pope'?\" Witness, with\r\ngreat emphasis: \"No. Certainly not. Jamie was never any ways a\r\n_religious_ man.\" These bewildering corruptions of sense and sanity\r\noverwhelm you at every turn. Ask your neighbour offhand at a dinner in\r\nDublin: \"What is so-and-so, by the way?\" He will reply that so-and-so is\r\na doctor, or a government official, or a stockbroker, as it may happen.\r\nAsk him the same question at a dinner in Belfast, and he will\r\nautomatically tell you that so-and-so is a Protestant or a \"Papist.\"\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is that it would be difficult to find anywhere a more\r\nshameful exploitation, intellectual and economic, than that which has\r\nbeen practised on the Ulster Orangeman by his feudal masters. Were I to\r\nretort the abuse, with which my own creed is daily bespattered, I should\r\ndescribe him further as the only victim of clerical obscurantism to be\r\nfound in Ireland. Herded behind the unbridged waters of the Boyne, he\r\nhas been forced to live in a very Tibet of intellectual isolation.\r\nWhenever he moved in his thoughts a little towards that Ireland to\r\nwhich, for all his separatism, he so inseparably belongs, the ring of\r\nblockhouses, called Orange Lodges, was drawn tighter to strangle his\r\nwanderings. Mr Robert Lynd in his \"Home Life in Ireland,\" a book which\r\nought to have been mentioned earlier in these pages, relates the case\r\nof a young man who was refused ordination in the Presbyterian Church\r\nbecause he had permitted himself to doubt whether the Pope was in fact\r\nanti-Christ. And he writes with melancholy truth:\r\n\r\n     \"If the Presbyterian clergy had loved Ireland as much as they have\r\n     hated Rome they could have made Ulster a home of intellectual\r\n     energy and spiritual buoyancy long ago. They have preferred to keep\r\n     Ulster dead to fine ideas rather than risk the appearance of a few\r\n     unsettling ideas among the rest.\"\r\n\r\nIt has not been, one likes to think, a death, consummated and final, but\r\nrather an interruption of consciousness from which recovery is possible.\r\nDrugged with a poisonous essence, distilled from history for him by his\r\nexploiters, the Orangeman of the people has lived in a world of\r\nphantoms. In politics he has never in his whole career spoken for\r\nhimself. The Catholic peasant comes to articulate, personal speech in\r\nDavitt; the national aristocracy in Parnell. The industrial worker\r\ndiscovers within his own camp a multitude of captains. Even landlordism,\r\nalthough it has produced no leader, has produced many able spokesmen.\r\nEvery other section in Ireland enriches public life with an interpreter\r\nof its mind sprung from its own ranks. Orange Ulster alone has never yet\r\ngiven to its own democracy a democratic leader. This is indeed the\r\ncardinal misfortune, as well as the central secret, of Ulster Unionism.\r\nThe pivot on which it turns resides, not in the farms of Down or the\r\nfactories of Belfast, but in the Library of the Four Courts. Of the\r\nnineteen representatives who speak for it in Parliament no fewer than\r\nseven are King's Counsel. In the whole list there is not one delegate of\r\nlabour, nor one farmer. A party so constituted is bound to produce\r\nprodigies of nonsense such as those associated with Sir Edward Carson.\r\nThe leaders of the orchestra openly despise the instruments on which\r\nthey play. For followers, reared in the tradition of hysteria depicted\r\nabove, no raw-head is thought to be too raw, and no bloody-bones too\r\nbloody. And so we have King's Counsel, learned in the law, devising\r\nProvisional Governments, and Privy Councillors wallowing in imaginative\r\ntreason. As for the Bishops, they will talk daggers as luridly as the\r\nrest, but they will not even threaten to use any. And so does the pagan\r\nrage, and the heathen prophesy vain things.\r\n\r\nThat such a farce-tragedy can find a stage in the twentieth century is\r\npitiable. But it is not a serious political fact. It has the same\r\nrelation to reality that the cap-hunting exploits of Tartarin of\r\nTarascon had to the Franco-German war. It has been devised merely to\r\nmake flesh creep in certain tabernacles of fanaticism in the less\r\ncivilised parts of England and Scotland. So far as action goes it will\r\nend in smoke, but not in gunpowder-smoke. There will no doubt be riots\r\nin Belfast and Portadown, for which the ultimate responsibility will\r\nrest on learned counsel of the King. But there have been riots before,\r\nand the cause of Home Rule has survived all the blackguardism and\r\nbloodshed. It is lamentable that ministers of the gospel of Christ and\r\nleaders of public opinion should so inflame and exploit the\r\nsuperstitions of ignorant men; but not by these methods will justice be\r\nintimidated.\r\n\r\nAnd if \"Ulster\" does fight after all? In that event we must only\r\nremember how sorry George Stephenson was for the cow. The military\r\ntraditions of the Protestant North are not very alarming. The\r\ncontribution of the Enniskilleners to the Battle of the Boyne appears to\r\nhave consisted in running away with great energy and discretion. Nor did\r\nthey, or their associates, in later years shed any great lustre even on\r\nImperial arms. I have never heard that the Connaught Rangers had many\r\nrecruits from the Shankhill Road, or the Dublin Fusiliers from\r\nPortadown; consequently the present situation disgusts rather than\r\nterrifies us. If rifle-levers ever click in rebellion against a Home\r\nRule government, duly established by statute under the authority of the\r\nCrown, it will be astonishing to find that every bullet in Ireland is a\r\nmember of an Orange Lodge. If \"Ulster\" repudiates the arbitrament of\r\nreason, and the verdict of a free ballot, she simply puts herself\r\noutside the law. And she may be quite assured that the law, driven back\r\non its ultimate sanction of force, will very sharply and very amply\r\nvindicate itself.\r\n\r\nBut it is not courteous to the reader to detain him among such\r\nunrealities as Sir Edward Carson's Civil War. Treason, that is to say\r\nplatform treason, is not so much an eccentricity as a habit of\r\nOrangeism. It is a way they have in the Lodges, and their past history\r\nsupplies a corrective to their present outburst. Perhaps their most\r\nnotable exploit in armed loyalty was their attempt to dethrone, or\r\nrather to defeat in succession to the throne, Queen Victoria. This is a\r\nchapter in their history with regard to which they are far too modest\r\nand reticent.\r\n\r\nBut the leading case in recent years is of course the attitude of the\r\nLodges towards the Disestablishment of the Irish Episcopal Church in\r\n1869. The records are singularly rich in what I may perhaps call\r\nCarsonese. Dukes threatened to \"fight as men alone can fight who have\r\nthe Bible in one hand and the sword in the other.\" Learned counsel of\r\nthe Queen covenanted to \"seal their protest with their blood in\r\nmartyrdom and battle.\" Ministers of the gospel were all for kicking the\r\nCrown into the Boyne, keeping their powder dry, shouldering Minié\r\nrifles, and finally joining the lawyers in the red grave of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nAn Ulster poet (a satirist one fears) wrote a famous invocation to the\r\nstatue of Mr Walker near Derry, beginning:\r\n\r\n    \"Come down out o' that, Mr Walker,\r\n      There's work to be done by-and-by,\r\n    And this is no time to stand glowerin'\r\n      Betwixt the bog-side and the sky.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr Walker did not come down: he remained on his safe pinnacle of\r\nimmortality. And of course there was no civil war. That period was wiser\r\nthan our own in one respect: nobody of any common sense thought of\r\nspoiling such exquisite blague by taking it seriously. Its motive was\r\nuniversally understood in Ireland. The orators of the movement never for\r\na moment dreamed of levying war on Mr Gladstone, but they were\r\ndetermined to levy blackmail. They saw that they could bluff English\r\nopinion into granting all manner of extravagant compensation for the\r\nextinction of their privileges and their ascendancy, if only the Orange\r\ndrum was beaten loudly enough. It was a case of the more cry the more\r\nwool. And in point of fact they succeeded. They obtained financial\r\narrangements of the most generous character, and, thereafter, the\r\nbattle-flags were furled. Within five years of Disestablishment the\r\nEpiscopalian Synod was praising it as the happiest event in the life of\r\nthat Church. The lawyers, being denied the martyrdom of the battlefield,\r\nstolidly accepted that of promotion to the judicial bench, and a holy\r\nsilence descended on the divines.\r\n\r\nThis strategy having succeeded so admirably in 1868 is repeated in 1912.\r\n\"Ulster\" has not the least intention of raising war or the sinews of\r\nwar; her interest is in the sinews of peace. Although she does not hold\r\na winning card in her hand she hopes to scoop the pool by a superb\r\nbluff. By menaces of rebellion she expects to be able to insist that\r\nunder Home Rule she shall continue encased in an impenetrable armour of\r\nprivileges, preferences, and safeguards. She is all the more likely to\r\nsucceed because of the tenderness of Nationalist Ireland in her regard.\r\nShort of the absolute surrender by the majority of every shred of its\r\nrights (which is, of course, what is demanded) there are very few\r\nsafeguards that we are not prepared to concede to the superstition, the\r\negotism, or even the actual greed of the Orangemen. But it may as well\r\nbe understood that we are not to be either duped or bullied.\r\n\r\nIf the policy of Ulster Unionism is unreal there is no word in any\r\nlanguage that can describe the phantasmal nature of the grounds on which\r\nit professes to fear national freedom. Home Rule, declare the orators,\r\nwill obviously mean Rome Rule. The _Ne Temere_ decree will de-legitimise\r\nevery Protestant in the country. The Dublin Parliament will tax every\r\n\"Ulster\" industry out of existence. One is told that not only do many\r\npeople say, but that some people even believe things of this kind. But\r\nthen there are people who believe that they are made of Dresden china,\r\nand will break if they knock against a chair. These latter are to be\r\nfound in lunatic asylums. It is indeed particularly worth noting that\r\nwhen a man begins to see in the whole movement of the world a conspiracy\r\nto oppress and injure him our first step is to inquire not into his\r\ngrievance but into his sanity. One finds the same difficulty in\r\ndiscussing Irish politics in terms of the three hallucinations specified\r\nthat one finds in discussing, say, Rugby football with a Dresden-china\r\nfellow-citizen. It is better not to make the attempt, but to substitute\r\na plain statement of obvious facts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, even if any policy of oppression were in our minds,\r\nit is not in our power. The overlordship of the Imperial Parliament\r\nremains in any scheme of Home Rule unimpaired, and any man damnified\r\nbecause of his religion can appeal in last resort to the Imperial Army\r\nand Navy. Shankhill Road is mathematically safe. After all there are in\r\nEngland some forty millions of Protestants who, whatever their religious\r\ntemperature may be, will certainly decline to see Protestantism\r\npenalised. The Protestants in Ireland have a million and a quarter, and\r\nthey make noise enough for twice the number. There are about three and a\r\nquarter millions of Irish Catholics. History concedes to Catholic\r\nIreland the cleanest record in respect of religious tolerance to be\r\nfound anywhere in Europe. We never martyred a saint, and amid all the\r\nwitch-hunting devilries of Scotland and England we burned only one\r\nwitch, a namesake of my own. Deny or suppress all this. Imagine into\r\nthe eyes of every Catholic neighbour the slumbering but unquenched fires\r\nof Smithfield. But be good enough to respect mathematics. Do not suggest\r\nthat the martial qualities induced by the two religions are so\r\ndissimilar that two Catholics are capable of imposing Home Rule on\r\ntwenty-five Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that we shall overtax \"Ulster\" is even more captivating.\r\nBut how are we to do it? Of course we might schedule the sites given up\r\nto Protestant church buildings as undeveloped land. Or we might issue\r\nincome-tax forms with an assessment printed on one side, and the decrees\r\nof the Council of Trent on the other. Or we might insist on every orator\r\ndesirous of uttering that ennobling sentiment, \"To Hell with the Pope!\"\r\ntaking out a licence, and charge him a small fee. Positive treason, such\r\nas the proclamation of Provisional Governments, would of course pay a\r\nhigher rate. All these would be most interesting experiments, and would\r\nadd a picturesque touch to the conventionality of modern administration.\r\nBut if we were to overtax sugar or coffee, corn or butter, flax or wool,\r\nbeer or spirits, land or houses, I fear that we should be beating\r\nourselves rather severely with our own sticks. Our revenge on \"Ulster\"\r\nwould be rather like that of Savage, the poet, who revenged himself on\r\na friend by sleeping out the whole of a December night on a bridge. The\r\nwhole suggestion is, of course, futile and fantastic. It is a bubble\r\nthat has been pricked, and by no one so thoroughly as by Lord Pirrie,\r\nthe head of Harland and Wolff, that is to say the leader of the\r\nindustrial North.\r\n\r\nThe clamour of the exploiters of \"Ulster\" is motived on this point by\r\ntwo considerations, the one an illusion, the other a reality. The\r\nillusion, or rather the pretence, consists in representing the Unionists\r\nas the sole holders of wealth in Ireland. It would be a sufficient\r\nrefutation of this view to quote those other passages in which the same\r\norators assert with equal eloquence that the Tory policy of land\r\npurchase and resolute government from Westminster has brought enormous\r\nprosperity to the rest of the country. On _per capita_ valuation the\r\nhighest northern county ranks only twelfth in Ireland. It is the\r\nreality, however, that supplies the clue. While the masters of Orangeism\r\ndo not represent the wealth of Ireland they do certainly represent the\r\nlargest, or, at least, the most intense concentration of unearned\r\nincomes. What they fear is not unjust but democratic taxation. They\r\ncling to the Union as a bulwark against the reform movement which in\r\nevery modern state is resuming for society a small part of certain vast\r\nfortunes which in their essence have been socially created. But even on\r\nthe plane of their own selfishness they are following a foolish line of\r\naction. The Union did not save them from the Land Tax Budget, nor, as\r\nregards the future, is salvation of the English Tories. Should they ever\r\nreturn to power they will repeat their action respecting the Death\r\nDuties. Having in Opposition denounced the land taxes with indecent\r\nbitterness they will, when back in office, confirm and extend them.\r\n\"Ulster\" had far better cast in her lot with Ireland. She will find an\r\nIrish Assembly not only strikingly but, one might almost add, sinfully\r\nconservative in matters of taxation. As to the conflict between the\r\nagrarian and the manufacturing interests, that also exists in every\r\nnation on the earth. But neither has any greater temptation to plan the\r\ndestruction of the other than a merchant has to murder his best\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\nThere remains the weltering problem of mixed marriages and the _Ne\r\nTemere_ decree. It is perhaps worth observing that marriages get mixed\r\nin other countries as well as in Ireland. It grieves one that men should\r\ndiffer as to the true religious interpretation of life. But they do in\r\nfact differ, and wherever two human beings, holding strongly to\r\ndifferent faiths, fall in love there is tragic material. But they do in\r\nfact fall in love. The theme recurs, with a thousand reverberations, in\r\nthe novel literature of England, France, and Germany. The situation\r\noccurs also in Ireland. But I am bewildered to know in what way it is an\r\nargument for or against Home Rule. Let us appeal once more to colonial\r\nexperience and practice. There is a Catholic majority in Canada and an\r\noverwhelming Catholic majority in Quebec. The policy of the Catholic\r\nChurch towards mixed marriages is precisely the same there as in\r\nIreland. Does Protestantism demand that the constitutions of the\r\nDominion and the Province respectively shall be withdrawn? Since no such\r\nclaim is made we must conclude that the outcry on Orange platforms is\r\ndesigned not to enforce a principle but to awaken all the slumbering\r\nfires of prejudice. The _Ne Temere_ decree introduces no new departure.\r\nNow, as always, the Catholic Church requires simply that her members\r\nshall consecrate the supreme adventure of life with the Sacrament of\r\ntheir fathers before the altar of their fathers. It is strange that the\r\nOrangemen, believing as they do that the Pope is anti-Christ, should be\r\nso annoyed at finding that the Pope teaches a doctrine different from\r\ntheirs on the subject of marriage. The Pope can inflict no spiritual\r\npenalties on them since they are outside his flock. He can inflict no\r\ncivil penalties on anybody. There is undoubtedly in the matter of\r\ndivorce a sharp conflict between Catholic ideas and the practice and\r\nopinion of Protestant countries. That exists, and will continue, under\r\nevery variation of government. It is an eternal antinomy. But whom does\r\nit aggrieve? We Catholics voluntarily abjure the blessings of divorce,\r\nbut we should never dream of using the civil law to impose our\r\nabnegation on those of another belief. If there is any doubt upon that\r\npoint it can very easily be removed. The civil law of marriage can be\r\nconserved under one of the \"safeguards.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that in order to test our tolerance Orangeism proposes to\r\nus a series of exercises which are a very delirium of intolerance.\r\n\"Sever yourselves,\" it says in effect to us, \"from all allegiance to\r\nthat Italian Cardinal. Consign him, as Portadown does, to hell. Bait\r\nyour bishops. Deride the spiritual authority of your priests. Then shall\r\nwe know that you are men and masters of your own consciences. Elect a\r\nUnionist Council in every county, a Unionist Corporation in Dublin, then\r\nshall we know that you are brothers. Disown your dead leaders. Spit on\r\nthe grave of Emmet. Teach your children that every Fenian was a\r\nmurderer. Erase from your chronicles the name of Parnell. Then shall we\r\nknow that you are loyal.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been occasionally urged by writers who prefer phrases to\r\nactualities that Home Rule must wait on the conversion of \"Ulster.\"\r\nTherein the patient must minister to himself. Miracles of that order\r\ncannot be accomplished from without. Great is Diana of the Ephesians,\r\nand the servitude of tradition is at an end only when the hands that\r\nfashioned the idols shatter them on the altars of a new nobleness. Let\r\nus distinguish. The Orangeism which is merely an instrument of\r\nexploitation and domination will not yield to reason. The Orangeism\r\nwhich is an inherited hysteria will not yield to reason. It Bourbonises\r\ntoo much. It lives in the past, learning nothing and forgetting nothing.\r\nArgument runs off it like rain off a duck's back. These two types of\r\nthought we must leave to the grace of God, and the education of the\r\naccomplished fact. They represent a declining cause, and a decaying\r\nparty. The Lodges once mustered more than 200,000 members; they have\r\nnow less than 10,000. There is another kind of Orangeism, that which has\r\nbegun to think, and the Orangeism that has begun to think is already\r\nconverted. I said that Protestant \"Ulster\" had never given to its own\r\ndemocracy a leader, but to say that is to forget John Mitchel. Master in\r\nprose of a passion as intense as Carlyle's and far less cloudy, of an\r\nirony not excelled by Swift, Mitchel flung into the tabernacles of his\r\nown people during the Great Famine a sentence that meant not peace but a\r\nsword. He taught them, as no one since, that Orangeism was merely a\r\nweapon of exploitation. While the band played \"The Boyne Water\" and the\r\npeople cheered it, the landlords were picking the pockets of the\r\necstatic crowd.\r\n\r\n     \"The Pope, we know, is the 'man of sin,'\" wrote Mitchel, \"and the\r\n     'Antichrist,' and also, if you like, the 'mystery of iniquity,' and\r\n     all that, but he brings no ejectments in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nMitchel travelled too fast for co-religionists whose shoulders had not\r\nyet slipped the burden of old superstitions. The élan of genius and the\r\ncall of freedom drew him out of the home of his fathers to consort with\r\nPapists, rebels, and transported convicts. But his failure was the seed\r\nof later success. In a few years the League of North and South was able\r\nto unite Protestant and Catholic on the plain economic issue that\r\nlandlordism must go. That too failed, but the stream of democratic\r\nthought had been merely driven underground to reappear further on in the\r\ncentury. In the elections that shook the fortress of Toryism in Ulster\r\nin the seventies Catholic priests marched at the head of processions\r\nside by side with Grand Masters of Orange Lodges. In the first years of\r\nthe Land League, Michael Davitt was able to secure the enthusiastic\r\nsupport of purely Orange meetings in Armagh. Still later, Mr T. W.\r\nRussell, at the head of a democratic coalition, smashed the old\r\nAscendancy on the question of compulsory purchase, and Mr Lindsay\r\nCrawford founded his Independent Order, a portent if not yet a power. So\r\nmuch has been done in the country. But it is in the cities, those\r\nworkshops of the society of the future, that the change is most marked.\r\nThe new movement finds an apt epitome in the political career of Mr\r\nJoseph Devlin. The workers of Belfast had been accustomed to see labour\r\nproblems treated by the old type of Unionist member of parliament either\r\nwith cowardice or with contempt. _Enfin Malesherbes vint_. At last a\r\nman rose up out of their own class, although a Catholic and a\r\nNationalist. He spoke with an awakening eloquence, and he made good his\r\nwords. In every industrial struggle in that sweated city he interposed\r\nhis strong word to demand justice for the wage-earner. This was a new\r\nsort of politics. It bore fruit where Ulster Unionism had been but a\r\nbarren fig-tree. The democracy of Belfast accepted their leader. They\r\ngave him a majority of 16 in West Belfast in 1906 and in four years they\r\nhad multiplied it by forty. The Boyne was bridged, and everything that\r\nhas since happened has but added a new stay or girder to the strength of\r\nthe bridge. And not only labour but capital has passed across that\r\nestranging river to firm ground of patriotism and national unity. Lord\r\nPirrie, the head of the greatest manufacturing enterprise in Belfast, is\r\nan ardent Home Ruler. Business men, ministers of religion, even lawyers,\r\nare thinking out things quietly beneath the surface. The new \"Ulster\" is\r\nbreaking its shell. Parties are forming on the basis of economic\r\nrealities, not on that of \"religious\" phantasms.\r\n\r\nAs for the old \"Ulster,\" it remains a problem not for the War Office,\r\nbut for the Department of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICS OF HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inevitableness of Home Rule resides in the fact that it is, as one\r\nmight say, a biped among ideas. It marches to triumph on two feet, an\r\nIrish and an Imperial foot. If there were in Ireland no demand whatever\r\nfor self-government it would, nevertheless, be necessary in the\r\ninterests of the Empire to force it on her. The human, or as some people\r\nmay prefer to call it, the sociological case for Home Rule, and the\r\nhistorical case for it have already been outlined. We now turn to\r\nconsideration, of another order, derived from Political Mechanics, or\r\nrather bearing on the mere mechanism of politics. Let us approach the\r\nproblem first from the Imperial side.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the most remarkable thing about the British Empire is that\r\nthere is no British Empire. We are in presence of the familiar\r\ndistinction between the raw material and the finished article. There\r\nare, indeed, on the surface of the globe a number of self-governing\r\ncolonies, founded and peopled by men of Irish and English blood. In each\r\nof these the United Kingdom is represented by a Governor whose whole\r\nduty consists in being seen on formal occasions, but never heard in\r\ncounsel or rebuke. The only other connecting links are those of law and\r\nfinance. The Privy Council acts as a Court of Appeal in certain causes,\r\nand Colonial Governments borrow money in the London market. These\r\ncommunities widely seperated in geography and in temperament, have no\r\ncommon fiscal policy, no common foreign policy, no common scheme of\r\ndefence, no common Council to discuss and decide Imperial affairs. Now\r\nthis may be a very wise arrangement, but you must not call it an Empire.\r\nFrom the point of view of unity, if from no other, it presents an\r\nunfavourable contrast to French Imperialism, under which all the oversea\r\ncolonies are represented in the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. In the\r\nEnglish plan the oversea colonies are unrelated atoms. You may say that\r\nthey afford all the materials for a grandiose federation; but if you\r\nhave flour in one bag, and raisins in another, and candied peel in\r\nanother, and suet in another you must not call them a Christmas pudding\r\nuntil they have been mixed together and cooked. Those areas of the\r\nglobe, coloured red on the maps, may have all the resources requisite\r\nfor a great, self-sufficing, economic unit of a new order. Their peoples\r\nmay desire that new order. But until it is achieved you must remember\r\nthat the British Empire belongs to the region of dream and not to that\r\nof fact.\r\n\r\nFor many years now, apostles of reconstruction have been hammering out\r\nthe details of a scheme that shall unify the Empire on some sort of\r\nFederal basis. For the new organism which they desire to create they\r\nneed a brain. Is this to be found in the Westminster Assembly, sometimes\r\nloosely styled the \"Imperial Parliament\"? As things stand at present\r\nsuch a suggestion is a mere counter-sense. That body has come to such a\r\npass as would seem to indicate the final bankruptcy of the governing\r\ngenius of England. All the penalties of political gluttony have\r\naccumulated on it. Parliament, to put the truth a little brutally, has\r\nbroken down under a long debauch of over-feeding. Every day of every\r\nsession it bites off far more in the way of bills and estimates than it\r\neven pretends to have time to chew. Results follow which it would be\r\nindiscreet to express in terms of physiology. Tens of millions are\r\nshovelled out of the Treasury by an offhand, undiscussed, perfunctory\r\nresolution. The attempt to compress infinite issues in a space too\r\nlittle has altered and, as some critics think, degraded the whole tenor\r\nof public life. Parliament is no longer the Grand Inquest of the Nation,\r\nat least not in the ancient and proper meaning of the words. The\r\ndeclaration of Edmund Burke to the effect that a member has no right to\r\nsacrifice his \"unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened\r\nconscience\" to any set of men living may be echoed by the judges in our\r\nday, but to anyone who knows the House of Commons it is a piece of pure\r\nirony. Party discipline cracks every session a more compelling whip; and\r\nour shepherded, regimented, and automatised representatives themselves\r\nrealise that, whatever more desirable status they may have attained,\r\nthey have certainly lost that of individual freedom. Out of their own\r\nranks a movement has arisen to put an end altogether to Party\r\ngovernment. This proposal I myself believe to be futile, but its very\r\nfutility testifies to the existence of an intolerable situation. All\r\nthis turns on the inadequacy of the time of the House of Commons to its\r\nbusiness. But the distribution of such time as there is, is a revel of\r\nineptitudes. It resembles the drawing of a schoolboy who has not yet\r\nlearned perspective. A stranger dropping into the Chamber will find it\r\nspending two hours in helping to determine whether Russia is to have a\r\nCzar, and the next four hours helping to determine whether Rathmines is\r\nto have, let us say, a new sewer. The affairs of India, involving the\r\npolitical welfare of three hundred millions of human beings, get one\r\nday; Egypt, that test case in international ethics, has to be content\r\nwith a few scattered hours. And, despite all this, local questions are\r\nnot considered at sufficient length or with sufficient knowledge. The\r\nparish pump is close enough to spoil St Stephen's as an Imperial\r\nCouncil, and yet so far away as to destroy its effectiveness as an organ\r\nof local government.\r\n\r\nSuch an assembly is clearly unfitted to function as the cerebrum of\r\nEmpire. It must be relieved of burdens which in the complexity of modern\r\npolitics it is no longer able to bear. How is this to be done? In one\r\nway and in one way only, by leaving local business to local bodies. But\r\nthat is Home Rule, or, as the learned, envisaging the idea from another\r\npoint of view, sometimes prefer to call it, Devolution. Through the\r\nprinciple of autonomy, incompletely applied, the British Possessions\r\nhave so far evolved. Through the principle of autonomy, completely\r\napplied, and in no other wise, can they evolve into an ordered system\r\nworthy of the Imperial name. This is at first blush a singular\r\ndevelopment. Here lie Ireland and England separated by a mountain of\r\nmisunderstanding. We Irish Nationalists have for a century been trying\r\nto bore a tunnel through from one side. And suddenly we become aware of\r\nthe tapping of picks not our own, and encounter midway the tunnel which\r\nthe Party of Imperial Reconstruction have driven through from the other\r\nside. Here are all the materials for a _tableau_. Justice falls on the\r\nneck of expediency. Imperialism recognises in nationality no rebel but a\r\nson of the house. Toryism rubs its eyes, and finds that it is Home Rule.\r\n\r\nBut, sounded to its depths, this new current of thought appears not only\r\nnot eccentric but inevitable. Ample explanation is to be found in the\r\nhistory of the Irish fight for self-government. On this subject there\r\nhas been in Ireland a marked evolution of ideas. O'Connell began by\r\ndemanding simple Repeal of the Union and the Restoration of Grattan's\r\nParliament. But by 1844 he had advanced towards a Federal programme.\r\n\r\n\"Beside the local Parliament in Ireland having full and perfect local\r\nauthority,\" he writes in that year, \"there should be, for questions of\r\nImperial concern, colonial, military, and naval, and of foreign alliance\r\nand policy, a Congressional or Federal Parliament, in which Ireland\r\nshould have a fair share and proportion of representation and power.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposed change of programme came in a questionable shape to a\r\nsuspicious time. It was not received with universal favour, and, to\r\navert dissension, it was represented as a mere _ballon d'essai_ and was\r\nabandoned. O'Connell died, and Repeal and Federation alike were\r\nswallowed up in the Great Famine. But time was to renew its urgency. The\r\nessential facts, and the logic of the facts, remained unaltered. When\r\nIsaac Butt came to formulate his scheme at the Home Rule Conference in\r\n1873 he renewed the Federal proposal in terms almost verbally the same.\r\nThe Conference resolved:\r\n\r\n     \"That, in claiming these rights and privileges for our country, we\r\n     adopt the principle of a Federal arrangement, which would secure to\r\n     the Irish Parliament the right of legislating for and regulating\r\n     all matters relating to the internal affairs of Ireland, while\r\n     _leaving to the Imperial Parliament the power of dealing with all\r\n     questions affecting the Imperial and Government, legislation\r\n     regarding the colonies and other dependencies of the Crown, the\r\n     relations of the Empire with Foreign States, and all matters\r\n     appertaining to the defence and stability of the Empire at large;\r\n     as well as the power of granting and providing the supplies\r\n     necessary for Imperial purposes_.\"\r\n\r\nParnell, who was a supreme master of the art of doing one thing at a\r\ntime, naturally laid the emphasis on Ireland. But when he was asked by\r\nMr Cecil Rhodes to agree to the retention of Irish representatives at\r\nWestminster in the interests of Imperial Federation, he declared himself\r\nin very definite terms:\r\n\r\n     \"It does not come so much within my province to express a full\r\n     opinion upon the larger question of Imperial federation, but I\r\n     agree with you that the continued Irish representation at\r\n     Westminster immensely facilitates such a step, while the contrary\r\n     provision in the Bill of 1886 would have been a bar. Undoubtedly\r\n     this is a matter which should be dealt with largely in accordance\r\n     with the opinion of the Colonies themselves, and if they should\r\n     desire to share in the cost of Imperial matters, as undoubtedly\r\n     they now do in the responsibility, and should express a wish for\r\n     representation at Westminster, I certainly think it should be\r\n     accorded to them, and that public opinion in these islands would\r\n     unanimously concur in the necessary constitutional modifications.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, if you will, thinking Imperially. Mr Redmond stands where\r\nParnell stood. He claims for the Irish people \"the legislative and\r\nexecutive control of all purely Irish affairs.\" But he is altogether\r\nfriendly to a later and larger application of the principle of autonomy.\r\n\r\nBut where, asks the triumphant critic not quite ingenuously, is the line\r\nto be drawn between local and Imperial affairs? Problems far more\r\nperplexed than this have been solved by the wit of man. The line was\r\ndrawn by O'Connell and Butt, by Parnell and Gladstone. It can be drawn\r\nto meet the circumstances of to-day by men of goodwill, after discussion\r\nand mutual adjustment. But why not postpone the case of Ireland until a\r\nscheme of Home Rule all round either for the United Kingdom or for the\r\nwhole Empire has been worked out? We answer that Ireland comes first on\r\ngrounds both of ethics and of expediency. Through all the blackness of\r\ndismal years we have laboured to preserve the twin ideas of nationality\r\nand autonomy, and the labourer is worthy of his hire. But a Home Rule\r\nassembly, functioning in Dublin, may well furnish the germ of a\r\nreorganisation of the Empire. If so, let it be remembered that it was\r\nnot Mr Chamberlain but Daniel O'Connell who first in these countries\r\ngave to Imperialism a definite and articulate form. In any event Home\r\nRule is the only remedy for the present congestion of St Stephen's. It\r\nis the only tonic that can restore to English public life its old vigour\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nSuch are the necessities and such is the future of the Empire merely as\r\na problem in what has been called Political Mechanics. We have now, from\r\nthe same point of view, to examine very cursorily the present government\r\nof Ireland. The phrasing, let me interpose, is inaccurate. Ireland, in\r\nour day, is not governed; it is only administered. A modern government,\r\nif it wishes to be real, must above all else explain itself. For such\r\nluxuries, so far as Ireland is concerned, there is no time in the House\r\nof Commons. A modern government must exercise active control over every\r\ndepartment of public business. For such an effort there is, so far as\r\nIreland is concerned, no energy in the House of Commons. Once in a blue\r\nmoon it does of course become necessary to pass an Irish Bill, a\r\nUniversity or a Land Bill. The Party shepherds round up their flocks,\r\nand, for a reluctant day or two, they have to feed sparely in\r\nunaccustomed pastures. Or again, as in 1886, 1893, or 1912, Ireland\r\ndominates British politics, and the English members descend on her with\r\na heavy flop of hatred or sympathy as it may happen. But at all other\r\ntimes the Union Parliament abdicates, or at least it \"governs\" Ireland\r\nas men are said sometimes to drive motor-cars, in a drowse. Three\r\ndays--or is it two?--are given to Irish Estimates, and on each of these\r\noccasions the Chamber is as desolate as a grazing ranch in Meath.\r\nHonourable members snatch at the opportunity of cultivating their souls\r\nin the theatres, clubs, restaurants, and other centres of culture in\r\nwhich London abounds. The Irish Party is compelled by the elemental\r\nnecessities of the situation to speak with one voice on matters\r\nregarding which there would properly be at least two voices in an Irish\r\nParliament, precisely identical in personnel. Ulster Unionism presents a\r\nsimilar solidarity.\r\n\r\nWhenever a point of any novelty is made, the Chief Secretary's secretary\r\nslips over to one of the Irish Officials who on these occasions lie\r\nambushed at the back of the Speaker's chair, and returns with all the\r\nelation of a honey-laden bee. His little burden of wisdom is gratefully\r\nnoted on the margin of the typewritten brief which has been already\r\nprepared in Dublin by the Board under discussion, and, entrenched behind\r\nthis, the Right Honourable gentleman winds up the debate. Sometimes his\r\nsolemnity wrings laughter from men, sometimes his flippancy wrings\r\ntears from the gods, but it does not in the least matter what he says.\r\nThe division bells ring; the absentees come trooping in, learn at the\r\ndoor of the lobby, each from his respective Whip, whether his\r\nspontaneous, independent judgment has made him a Yes! or a No! and vote\r\naccordingly in the light of an unsullied conscience. The Irish\r\nofficials, with a sigh of relief or a shrug of contempt, collect their\r\nhats and umbrellas, and retire to their hotels to erase from their minds\r\nby slumber the babblings of a mis-spent evening. And the course of\r\nadministration in Ireland is as much affected by the whole proceedings\r\nas the course of an 80 h.p. Mercédès is affected by a cabman's oath.\r\n\r\nSo much for exclusively Irish affairs. When Ireland comes into some\r\n\"general\" scheme of legislation the parody of government becomes if\r\npossible more fantastic in character. Let me take just three\r\ninstances--Old Age Pensions, Insurance, and the Budget. In regard to the\r\nfirst it was perhaps a matter of course that no attempt should be made\r\nto allow for the difference in economic levels between Great Britain and\r\nIreland. This is the very principle of Unionism: to apply like methods\r\nto things which are unlike. But in the calculation of details an\r\nignorance was exhibited which passed the bounds of decency. Mistakes of\r\nfive or six per cent are, in these complex affairs, not only to be\r\nexpected but almost to be desired; they help to depress ministerial\r\ncocksureness. But in this case there was an error of 200 per cent, a\r\ncircumstance which incidentally established in the English mind a\r\npleasing legend of Irish dishonesty. The Insurance Bill was ushered in\r\nwith greater prudence. The \"government,\" recognising its own inability\r\nto lead opinion, had the grace to refrain from misleading it. No special\r\nIrish memorandum was issued, and no attempt was made to adjust the\r\nscheme to Irish social and economic conditions. But Budgets afford on\r\nthe whole the capital instance of what we may call legislation by\r\naccident. The Act of Union solemnly prescribes the principles on which\r\nthese measures are to be framed, and points to the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer as the trustee of Irish interests. But nobody of this\r\ngeneration ever knew a Chancellor of the Exchequer who had even read the\r\nAct of Union; Mr Lloyd George, on his own admission, had certainly not\r\nread it in 1909. What has happened is very simple. The fulfilment of\r\ntreaty obligations required differential taxation, but administrative\r\nconvenience was best served by a uniform system of taxation. In the\r\nstruggle between the two, conscience was as usual defeated. The\r\nChancellor, according to the practice which has overridden the Act of\r\nUnion budgets for Great Britain, drags the schedule of taxes so fixed\r\nthrough Ireland like a net, and counts the take. That, in the process,\r\nthe pledge of England should be broken, and her honour betrayed, is not\r\nregarded by the best authorities as an objection or even as a relevant\r\nfact. In the more sacred name of uniformity Ireland is swamped in the\r\nWestminster Parliament like a fishing-smack in the wash of a great\r\nmerchantman.\r\n\r\nBut let one illusion be buried. If Ireland does not govern herself it is\r\nquite certain that the British Parliament does not govern her. Changing\r\nthe venue of inquiry from London to Dublin we find ourselves still in\r\nregions of the fantastic. From the sober and unemotional pages of\r\n\"Whitaker's Almanack\" one learns, to begin with, that \"the government of\r\nIreland is semi-independent.\" The separatism of geography has in this\r\ncase triumphed. The _de facto_ rulers of Ireland in ordinary slack\r\ntimes, and in the daily round of business, are the heads of the great\r\nDepartments. Some of these are not even nominally responsible to\r\nParliament. The Intermediate Board, for instance, has for thirty years\r\ncontrolled secondary education, but it has never explained itself to\r\nParliament and, because of the source from which its funds are derived,\r\nit is not open to criticism in Parliament. But none of the heads are\r\nreally responsible to any authority except their own iron-clad\r\nconsciences and the officials of the Treasury, with whom, for the sake\r\nof appearances, they wage an unreal war. In theory, the Chief Secretary\r\nanswers to Parliament for the misdeeds of them all. In practice, this\r\nfines itself down to reading typewritten sophistications in reply to\r\noriginal questions, and improvising jokes, of a well-recognised pattern,\r\nto turn the point of supplementary questions for forty minutes on one\r\nday in the week during session. In its own internal economy the\r\ngovernment of Ireland is a form of Pantheism, with the Chief Secretary\r\nas underlying principle. He is the source of everything, good and evil,\r\nlight and darkness, benignity and malignity, with the unfortunate result\r\nthat he is in perpetual contradiction with himself. As we know, the\r\nequilibrium of modern governments is maintained by mutual strain between\r\nthe various ministers. Sometimes, as in the case of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, a strong personality, moved by a new idea, tears the\r\nstructure to pieces. But the Chief Secretary knows no such limitations\r\nfrom without. Theoretically, he may be produced to infinity in any\r\ndirection; he is all in every part. But, as a matter of fact, through\r\nthe mere necessity of filling so much space his control becomes rarefied\r\nto an invisible vapour; he ends by becoming nothing in any part. With\r\nits ultimate principle reduced to the status of a _Dieu fainéant_\r\npolitical Pantheism is transformed into political Atheism. Responsible\r\ngovernment is perceived not to exist in Ireland. Mr Barry O'Brien in his\r\nadmirable book, \"Dublin Castle and the Irish People,\" confesses himself\r\nunable to find a better characterisation of the whole system than is\r\ncontained in a well-known passage from \"The Mikado.\" I make no apology\r\nfor conveying it from him.\r\n\r\n     \"One cannot help recalling the memory of Pooh-Bah, 'Lord\r\n     High-Everything-Else' of the Mikado of Japan. Who forgets the\r\n     memorable scene between him and Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner,\r\n     on an occasion of supreme importance?\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. Pooh-Bah, it seems that the festivities in connection with\r\n     my approaching marriage must last a week. I should like to do it\r\n     handsomely, and I want to consult you as to the amount I ought to\r\n     spend upon them.\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. Certainly. In which of my capacities? As First Lord of\r\n     the Treasury, Lord Chamberlain, Attorney-General, Chancellor of the\r\n     Exchequer, Privy Purse, or Private Secretary?\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. Suppose we say as Private Secretary.\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. Speaking as your Private Secretary, I should say that\r\n     as the city will have to pay for it, don't stint yourself; do it\r\n     well.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. Exactly--as the city will have to pay for it. That is your\r\n     advice?\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. As Private Secretary. Of course you will understand\r\n     that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am bound to see that due\r\n     economy is observed.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. Oh, but you said just now, 'Don't stint yourself; do it\r\n     well.'\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. As Private Secretary.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. And now you say that due economy must be observed.\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. As Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. I see. Come over here where the Chancellor can't hear us.\r\n     _(They cross stage.)_ Now, as my Solicitor, how do you advise me to\r\n     deal with this difficulty?\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. Oh, as your Solicitor, I should have no hesitation in\r\n     saying chance it.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. Thank you _(shaking his head)_; I will.\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. If it were not that, as Lord Chief Justice, I am bound\r\n     to see that the law isn't violated.\r\n\r\n     _Ko-Ko_. I see. Come over here where the Chief Justice can't hear\r\n     us. (_They cross the stage_.) Now, then, as First Lord of the\r\n     Treasury?\r\n\r\n     _Pooh-Bah_. Of course, as First Lord of the Treasury, I could\r\n     propose a special vote that would cover all expenses if it were not\r\n     that, as leader of the Opposition, it would be my duty to resist\r\n     it, tooth and nail. Or, as Paymaster-General, I could so cook the\r\n     accounts that, as Lord High Auditor, I should never discover the\r\n     fraud. But then, as Archbishop of Jitipu, it would be my duty to\r\n     denounce my dishonesty, and give myself into my own custody as\r\n     Commissioner of Police.\"\r\n\r\nUnder such arrangements as these the inevitable happens. The Chief\r\nSecretary accepts his rôle. He is, no doubt, consoled to discover that\r\nin one sphere, namely in that of patronage, his supremacy is effective.\r\nHe discovers further that he can hamstring certain obnoxious Acts, as Mr\r\nWalter Long hamstrung the Land Act, by the issue of Regulations. The\r\nrest of his official career depends on his politics. If a Tory, he\r\nlearns that the Irish Civil Service is a whispering gallery along which\r\nhis lightest word is carried to approving ears, and loyally acted upon.\r\nFurther \"Ulster\" expects law and order to be vindicated by the\r\noccasional proclamation of Nationalist meetings, and batoning of\r\nNationalist skulls. And he absolutely must say from time to time in\r\npublic that the Irish Question in essence is not political but economic.\r\nThis is the whole duty of a Tory Chief Secretary. A Liberal Chief\r\nSecretary functions on somewhat different lines. Administration presents\r\nitself to him as a colossal heap of recalcitrant, wet sand out of which\r\nhe has to fashion a statue of fair-play. Having, with great labour, left\r\nhis personal impress on two or three handfuls, the weary Titan abandons\r\nhis impossible task. He falls back in good order on the House of\r\nCommons, where his party majority enables him to pass an Irish Bill from\r\ntime to time. His spare time he divides between commending Dublin Castle\r\nto the seven devils that made it, and praying for the advent of Home\r\nRule.\r\n\r\nIn either case the sovereignty of Ireland relapses into the hands of the\r\npermanent officials, that camarilla of Olympians. To the official lives\r\nof these gentlemen, regarded as works of art, I raise my hat in\r\nrespectful envy. They have realised the vision of Lucretius. From the\r\nsecure remoteness of their ivory towers they look down unmoved on the\r\nstormy and drifting tides below, and they enjoy the privilege, so rare\r\nin Ireland, of knowing the causes of things. To the ordinary man their\r\npolitical origins are shrouded in twilight. They seem to him to have\r\ncome like water, but unhappily it cannot be said that they go like wind.\r\nWhile they are with us they are absolute, seen by nobody, felt by all\r\nthe world, the Manchu mandarins of the West. They have been attacked on\r\nmany foolish counts; let us in justice to them and ourselves be quite\r\nclear as to what is wrong with them. Some people say that there are too\r\nmany Boards, but it is to be remembered that for every new function with\r\nwhich we endow the State it must have a new organ. Others say that they\r\nare over-staffed; but all government departments in the world are\r\nover-staffed. Still others say that they are stupid and corrupt. As for\r\ncorruption, it certainly does exist under many discreet veils, but its\r\nold glory is fading. Incompetent the great officials never were. A poet\r\ntells us that there are only two people in the world who ever understand\r\na man--the woman who loves him, and the enemy who hates him best. In one\r\nof these ways, if not in the other, Dublin Castle understands Ireland.\r\nDid it not know what the people of Ireland want, it could not so\r\ninfallibly have maintained its tradition of giving them the opposite.\r\nOther critics again find the deadly disease of the Boards to reside in\r\nthe fact that they are a bureaucracy. This diagnosis comes closer to the\r\ntruth, but it is not yet the truth. Bureaucracies of trained experts are\r\nbecoming more and not less necessary. What is really wrong with the\r\nCastle is that it is a bureaucracy which has usurped the throne of the\r\nnation. \"In England,\" declared Mr Gladstone, \"when the nation attends,\r\nit can prevail.\" In Ireland, though it should attend seven days in the\r\nweek, it could never under present arrangements stamp the image of its\r\nwill on public policy. The real sin of the Castle regime is that it is a\r\nsham, a rococo, a despotism painted to look like representative\r\ngovernment. To quote a radiant commonplace, the rich significance of\r\nwhich few of us adequately grasp, it does not rest on the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n     \"From whatever point of view we envisage the English Government in\r\n     Ireland,\" writes Mr Paul-Dubois, \"we are confronted with the same\r\n     appearance of constitutional forms masking a state of things which\r\n     is a compound of autocracy, oppression, and corruption.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a system does not possess within itself the seed of continuance.\r\nDisraeli announced, somewhat prematurely, the advent of an age in which\r\ninstitutions that could not bear discussion would have to go. Matthew\r\nArnold yearned for a time in which the manifestly absurd would be\r\nabandoned. In the flame of either dictum the present \"government\" of\r\nIreland shrivels to ashes, and affairs are ripe for the application of\r\nboth. Here, as in the Colonies, the people must enter into its heritage.\r\nThe days are for ever dead in which a nation could be ruled in daily\r\ndisregard of its history, its ideals, its definite programme.\r\n\r\nOn the minutiae of administration I do not mean to touch. When the whole\r\nspirit, atmosphere, and ethos are anti-moral it is idle to chronicle any\r\nchance rectitude of detail. If a man is a murderer it is not much to his\r\ncredit to observe that he has triumphed over the primitive temptation to\r\neat peas with his knife. If a government is based on contempt for public\r\nopinion, as its fundamental principle, no useful purpose is served by a\r\nrecord of the occasions on which a policeman has been known to pass a\r\ncitizen in the street without beating him. But there is one further\r\nconfirmation of the view, here advanced, to omit which would be to\r\nignore the most significant fact of our time. Certain departments such\r\nas the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture,\r\nrecent creations, have been freshened by the introduction of a\r\nrepresentative, non-official element. Others such as the Estates\r\nCommission have been under the control of officials of a new type, able\r\nmen who do not conceal the fact that they believe in Ireland. All of\r\nthese new Boards have struck root in the national life to a depth never\r\nreached by any of their predecessors. The lesson of this change is the\r\nlesson of freedom. In the precise degree in which government trusts the\r\npeople will the people trust government. It remains to complete the\r\nprocess by a scheme of autonomy that shall make every administrator a\r\ntrustee and executant of the will of the nation.\r\n\r\nThere are other organs of \"government\" in Ireland of which the reader\r\nmay reasonably expect to hear something. He will permit me to discharge\r\nmy obligations by copying out certain paragraphs from an old note-book:\r\n\r\n     \"_Judges_.--It is a mistake to suppose that none of the Irish\r\n     Judges know any law. Our judiciary includes many masterly lawyers,\r\n     and many adroit men of the world. But all of them are political\r\n     appointments. Hence in ordinary cases a man will get clean justice.\r\n     But the moment politics flutter on the breeze, the masked battery\r\n     on the Bench is uncurtained to bellow forth anti-Nationalist\r\n     shrapnel. Irish Judges, in fact, are very like the horse in the\r\n     schoolboy's essay: 'The horse is a noble and useful quadruped, but,\r\n     when irritated, he ceases to do so.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Police_.--The Royal Irish Constabulary was formerly an Army of\r\n     occupation. Now, owing to the all but complete disappearance of\r\n     crime, it is an Army of no occupation.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Dublin Castle in general_.--Must be seen to be disbelieved.\"\r\n\r\nSince there does not exist a British Empire, it is necessary to invent\r\none. Since there does not exist an Irish government, in any modern and\r\nintelligible sense of the word, it is necessary to invent one. The\r\ncommon creative mould out of which both must be struck is the principle\r\nof Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAFTER HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advocates of Home Rule are invited to many ordeals by way of\r\nverifying their good faith; perhaps the heaviest ordeal is that of\r\nprophecy. Very well, people say, what are you going to do with Home Rule\r\nwhen you get it? What will Irish politics be like in, say, 1920? If we\r\nshow embarrassment or offer conflicting answers, the querist is\r\npersuaded that we are, as indeed he thought, vapouring sentimentalists,\r\nnot at all accustomed to live in a world of clear ideas and unyielding\r\nfacts. The demand, like many others made upon us, is unreal and\r\nunreasonable. What are the English going to do with Home Rule when they\r\nget it? What will German or Japanese or American politics be like in\r\n1920? These are all what Matthew Arnold calls \"undiscovered things.\" The\r\nfuture resolutely declines to speak out of her turn. She has a trick of\r\nkeeping her secrets well, better than she keeps her promises. Professor\r\nDicey wrote a Unionist tract, very vehement and thunderous, in which he\r\nsought to injure Home Rule by styling it a leap in the dark. But the\r\nwhole conduct of life, in its gravest and its lightest issues alike, is\r\na perpetual leap in the dark. Every change of public policy is a raid\r\nacross the frontiers of the unknown; or rather, as I prefer to put it,\r\nevery fundamental reform is essentially an Act of Faith in to-morrow,\r\nand so it is with Home Rule.\r\n\r\nBut while none of us can prophesy all of us can conjecture, and in this\r\ncase with a great deal of confidence. On the one hand, Ireland is a\r\ncountry of very definite habits of thought; on the other, her immediate\r\nproblems are obvious. These two circumstances facilitate the process\r\nwhich the learned describe as an attempt to produce the present curve of\r\nevolution into the future. First, then, as to the temper of mind in\r\nwhich an autonomous Ireland will face the world. The one clear certainty\r\nis that it will not be rhetorical or Utopian. Of all the libels with\r\nwhich we are pelted the most injurious to our repute is a kindly libel,\r\nthat which represents us as a nation of orators. To the primitive Tory\r\nthe Nationalist \"agitator\" appears in the guise of a stormy and\r\nintractable fiend, with futility in his soul, and a College Green\r\nperoration on his lips. The sources of this superstition are easily\r\ntraced. The English have created the noblest literature in the world,\r\nand are candidly ashamed of the fact. In their view anybody who succeeds\r\nin words must necessarily fail in business. The Irishman on the contrary\r\nluxuriates, like the artist that he is, in that _splendor verborum_\r\ncelebrated by Dante. If a speech has to be made he thinks that it should\r\nbe well made, and refuses altogether to accept hums and haws as a token\r\nof genius. He expects an orator not merely to expound facts, but to\r\nstimulate the vital forces of his audience. These contrary conceptions\r\nof the relation of art to life have, throughout the Home Rule campaign,\r\nclashed in the English mind much to our disadvantage. And there has been\r\nanother agent of confusion, more widely human in character. Every idea\r\nstrongly held and, on the other side, strongly challenged, kindles\r\nspontaneously into passion, and every great cause has its poetry as well\r\nas its dialetics. Men, forced to concentrate all their thought on one\r\nreform, come to see it edged with strange, mystical colours. Let justice\r\nonly triumph in this one regard, and our keel will grate on the shore of\r\nthe Fortunate Islands, the Earthly Paradise. All the harshness of life\r\nwill be dulcified; we shall lie dreaming on golden sands, dipping full\r\ngoblets out of a sea that has been transmuted into lemonade. This, the\r\nUtopian mood of humanity, is inextinguishable, and it has embroidered\r\nthe Home Rule idea in common with all others. Before the complexity of\r\nmodern economic organisation was as well understood as is now the case,\r\nthere is no doubt that certain sections of opinion in Ireland did regard\r\nself-government as a sort of Aladdin's Lamp, capable of any miracle. The\r\nnecessity of pressing all the energy of the nation into one channel had\r\nthe effect of imposing on political life a simplicity which does not\r\nbelong to it. But all that is over and past. The Ireland of to-day does\r\nnot pay herself with words. She is safe from that reaction and\r\ndisillusionment which some prophets have discerned as the first harvest\r\nof Home Rule, because she is already disillusioned. Looking into the\r\nfuture we see no hope for rhetoricians; what we do see is a strong,\r\nshrewd, indomitable people, at once clear-sighted and idealistic, going\r\nabout its business \"in the light of day in the domain of reality.\" No\r\nsigns or wonders blaze out a trail for them. The past sags on their\r\nshoulders and in their veins, a grievous burden and a grievous malady.\r\nThey make mistakes during their apprenticeship to freedom, for, as\r\nFlaubert says, men have got to learn everything from eating to dying.\r\nBut a few years farther on we see the recuperative powers of the nation\r\nonce more triumphant. The past is at last dead enough to be buried, the\r\nvirus of oppression has been expelled. The creative impulse in industry,\r\nliterature, social habit, working in an atmosphere of freedom, has added\r\nto the wealth of humanity not only an old nation renascent, but a new\r\nand kindlier civilisation. In other words, political autonomy is to us\r\nnot the epilogue but the prologue to our national drama. It rings the\r\ncurtain up on that task to which all politics are merely instrumental,\r\nnamely the vindication of justice and the betterment of human life.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the economic note will predominate in a Home Rule\r\nassembly, not only in the sense in which so much can be said of every\r\ncountry in the world, but in a very special sense. For the past decade\r\nIreland has been thinking in terms of woollens and linens, turnips and\r\nfat cattle, eggs and butter, banks and railways. The conviction that the\r\ncountry is under-developed, and in consequence under-populated, has been\r\ngrowing both in area and in depth. With it there has been growing the\r\nfurther conviction that poverty, in the midst of untapped resources, is\r\na national crime. The propagation of these two beliefs by journals of\r\nthe newer school such as _The Leader, Sinn Fein,_ and _The Irish\r\nHomestead_ has leavened the whole mass of Irish life in our time. The\r\nIndustrial Development Associations, founded on them as basis, have long\r\nago \"bridged the Boyne.\" At their annual Conferences Belfast sits side\r\nby side with Cork, Derry with Dublin. It is not merely that the\r\nmanufacturers and traders have joined hands to advance a movement\r\nbeneficial to themselves; the best thought of every class in the country\r\nhas given enthusiastic support to the programme on grounds not of\r\npersonal interest but of national duty. We may therefore take it that\r\nthe watchword of the Second Empire, _Enrichissez-vous,_ will be the\r\nwatchword of a self-governing Ireland. What Parliament and the State can\r\ndo to forward that aim will naturally be a subject of controversy. To\r\nFree Traders and Tariff Reformers, alike, the power that controls the\r\nCustoms' tariff of a country controls its economic destiny. Both would\r\nseem bound to apply the logic of their respective gospels to Ireland.\r\nBut as it is not the aim of this book to anticipate the debates of next\r\nyear, but rather to explain the foundations of the Home Rule idea, we\r\nmay leave that burning question for the present untouched. Apart from it\r\nwe can anticipate the trend of policy in Ireland. The first great task\r\nof a Home Rule Parliament would be above controversy; it would be\r\nneither more nor less than a scientific exploration of the country. No\r\nsuch Economic Survey has ever been made, and the results are lamentable.\r\nThere has been no mapping out of the soil areas from the point of view\r\nof Agricultural Economics, and, for the lack of such impartial\r\ninformation, the fundamental conflict between tillage and grazing goes\r\non in the dark. We know where coal is to be found in Ireland; we do not\r\nknow with any assurance where it is and where it is not profitably\r\nworkable. The same is true of granite, marble, and indeed all our\r\nmineral resources.\r\n\r\nThe woollen industry flourishes in one district and fails in another, to\r\nall appearance as favourably situated; it seems capable of great\r\nexpansion and yet it does not expand greatly. What then are the\r\nconditions of success? Here is a typical case that calls for scientific\r\nanalysis. One can pick at random a dozen such instances. Ireland,\r\nadmirably adapted to the production of meat, does not produce meat, but\r\nonly the raw material of it, store cattle. Is this state of things\r\nimmutable? Or is a remedy for it to be found, say, in a redistribution\r\nof the incidence of local taxation so as to favour well-used land as\r\nagainst ill-used land? Is the decline in the area under flax to be\r\napplauded or deplored? Can Irish-grown wool be improved up to the\r\nfineness of the Australian article? And so on, and so on. It is to be\r\nnoted that of the statistics which we do possess many of the most\r\nimportant are, to say the least, involved in doubt. The Export and\r\nImport figures are little better than volunteer estimates; there is no\r\ncompulsion to accuracy. As to the yield of crops, all that can be said\r\nis that our present information is not as bad as it used to be. But\r\nabove all we have no comprehensive notion of the condition of the\r\npeople. Whenever there has been an inquiry into wages, cost of living,\r\nor any other fundamental fact, Ireland has come in as a mere tail-piece\r\nto a British volume. All this we must change. The first business of an\r\nIrish Parliament will be to take stock; and this will be effected by the\r\nestablishment of a Commission of a new kind, representative of science,\r\nindustry, agriculture, and finance, acceptable and authoritative in the\r\neyes of the whole nation, and charged with the duty of ascertaining the\r\nactual state of things in Ireland and the wisest line of economic\r\ndevelopment. Such an undertaking will amount to a unification of Irish\r\nlife altogether without precedent. It will draw the great personalities\r\nof industry for the first time into the central current of public\r\naffairs. It will furnish them with a platform upon which they will have\r\nto talk in terms of the plough, the loom, and the ledger, and not in\r\nterms of the wolf-dog and the orange-lily, and will render fruitful for\r\nthe service of the country innumerable talents, now unknown or estranged\r\nby political superstitions. It will do all that State action can do to\r\ngenerate a boom in Irish enterprises, and to tempt Irish capital into\r\nthem in a more abundant stream. And the proceedings and conclusions of\r\nsuch a body, circulated broadcast somewhat after the Washington plan,\r\nwill provide for all classes in the community a liberal education in\r\nEconomics. Will \"Ulster\" fight against such an attempt to increase its\r\nprosperity? Will the shipbuilders, the spinners, and the weavers close\r\ndown their works in order to patronise Sir Edward Carson's performance\r\non a pop-gun? It is not probable.\r\n\r\nWork is the best remedy against such vapours, and an Ireland, occupied\r\nin this fashion-with wealth-producing labour, will have no time for\r\ncivil war or \"religious\" riots.\r\n\r\nAs for concrete projects, the Irish Parliament will not be able to\r\nbegin on a very ambitious scale. But there are two or three matters\r\nwhich it must at once put in hand. There is, for instance, the drainage\r\nof the Barrow and the Bann. These two rivers are in a remarkable degree\r\nnon-political and non-sectarian. Just as the rain falls on the just and\r\nthe unjust, so do their rain-swollen floods spoil with serene\r\nimpartiality Nationalist hay and Orange hay, Catholic oats and\r\nPresbyterian oats. Will \"Ulster\" fight against an effort to check the\r\nmischief? Then there is re-afforestation. As the result mainly of the\r\nwaste of war, Ireland, which ought to be a richly wooded country, is\r\nvery poor in that regard. In consequence of this, a climate, moister\r\nthan need be, distributes colds and consumption among the population,\r\nwithout any religious test, and unchecked winds lodge the corn of all\r\ndenominations. Re-afforestation, as offering a profit certain but a\r\nlittle remote, and promising a climatic advantage diffused over the\r\nwhole area of the country, is eminently a matter for public enterprise.\r\nAre we to be denied the hope that fir, and spruce, and Austrian pine may\r\nconceivably be lifted out of the plane of Party politics? Further, to\r\ntake instances at haphazard, the State, whatever else its economic\r\nfunctions may be, will be one of the largest purchasers of commodities\r\nin the country. It is thinkable that the Irish State may give its civil\r\nservants Irish-made paper to write on in their offices. It may even so\r\narrange things that when Captain Craig comes to the House of Commons at\r\nCollege Green he shall sit on an Irish-made bench, dine off a cloth of\r\nBelfast linen, and be ruthlessly compelled to eat Meath beef, Dublin\r\npotatoes, and Tipperary butter. In such horrible manifestations of Home\r\nRule I do not discern the material for a revolution. Again, it may be\r\nproposed that in order to develop manufactures, municipalities and\r\ncounty councils may be given power to remit local rates on newly\r\nestablished factories for an initial period of, say, ten years. It may\r\noccur to evil-minded people to increase the provision for technical\r\ninstruction in certain centres for the same end. The Irish State may\r\nthink it well to maintain agents in London, New York, and some of the\r\ncontinental capitals with a view to widening the external market for\r\nIrish products. I do not say that a Home Rule Parliament will do all\r\nthese things, but they are the sort of thing that it will do. And the\r\nmere naked enumeration of them is sufficient to show that such an\r\nAssembly will have ample matter of economic development upon which to\r\nkeep its teeth polished without devouring either priests or\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\nThere are other urgent questions upon which unanimity exists even at\r\npresent, for example Poor Law Reform. I have outlined in an earlier\r\nchapter the honourable record of Ireland in this regard. We were agreed\r\nin 1836 that the workhouse should never have come; we are now agreed\r\nthat it must go. Whether in Antrim or in Clare, the same vicious system\r\nhas produced the same vicious results. Uniform experience has issued in\r\nunanimous agreement as to the lines upon which reform ought to proceed.\r\nAt the same time there are differences as to detail, and the task of\r\nfusing together various views and hammering out of them a workable Bill\r\nwill be an ideal task for a representative assembly. But it is difficult\r\nto believe that the discussion will be, in all particulars, governed\r\neither by the Council of Trent, or by the Westminster Confession.\r\n\r\nThen there is education. English public men have been brought up to\r\nassume that in Ireland education must be a battleground inevitably, and\r\nfrom the first. It would be a mere paradox to say that this question,\r\nwhich sunders parties the world over as with a sword, will leave opinion\r\nin Ireland inviolately unanimous. But our march to the field of\r\ncontroversy will be over a non-controversial road. Union policy has left\r\nus a rich inheritance of obvious evils. The position of the primary\r\nteachers is unsatisfactory, that of the secondary teachers is\r\nimpossible. When we attempt improvement of both will \"Ulster\" fight? And\r\nthere is something even more human and poignant. The National Schools of\r\nthis country are in many cases no better than ramshackle barns. Unless\r\nthe teacher and the manager, out of their own pockets, mend the broken\r\nglass, put plaster on the walls, and a fire in the grate, the children\r\nhave got to shiver and cough for it. Winter in Ireland, like the King in\r\nconstitutional theory, is above politics. When its frosts get at the\r\nnoses, and fingers, and sometimes the bare toes, of the children it\r\nleaves them neither green nor orange but simply blue. Then again other\r\nschools, especially in Belfast, are shamefully over-crowded. Classes are\r\nheld on the stairs, in the cloak-room, the hall, or the yard. For the\r\nmore fortunate, class-rooms are provided with an air-space per\r\nindividual only slightly less than that available in the Black Hole of\r\nCalcutta. All over the country, children go to school breakfastless and\r\nstupid with hunger, and the local authorities have no power to feed them\r\nas in England, and in most European countries. Then again, even where\r\nthe physical conditions are reasonable, the programme lacks actuality.\r\nIt is unpractical, out of touch with the facts of life and locality, a\r\nveritable castle hung absurdly in the air and not based on any solid\r\nfoundation. The view still lingers in high places that the business of\r\neducation is to break the spirit of a people, to put them down and not\r\nto lift them up. In token of this, the teachers are denied the civil\r\nrights of freemen. Now all these ineptitudes are contrary to the humane\r\ntradition of Ireland. Go they must, but, when an Irish Parliament starts\r\nto remove them, I cannot imagine Captain Craig, with a Union Jack\r\nwrapped around his bosom, straddling like Apollyon across the path. The\r\nCaptain has far too much sense, and too much feeling in him.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we are getting on. A nation so busy with\r\nrealities will have no time to waste on civil war. _Inter leges arma\r\nsilent_. But this is a mere outline sketch of the preliminary task of\r\nthe initial sessions of an Irish Parliament. Problems with a far heavier\r\nfist will thunder at its doors, the problems of labour. The democratic\r\ngroup in Ireland, that group which everywhere holds the commission of\r\nthe future, has long since declared that, to it, Home Rule would be a\r\nbarren counter-sense unless it meant the redemption of the back streets.\r\nThe Titanic conflict between what is called capital and what is called\r\nlabour, shaking the pillars of our modern Society, has not passed\r\nIreland by like the unregarded wind. We can no longer think of ourselves\r\nas insulated from the world, immune from strikes, Socialists, and\r\nSyndicalism. The problems of labour have got to be faced. But will they\r\nbe solved by a grapple between the Orange Lodges and the Ancient Order\r\nof Hibernians? It is obvious that under their pressure the old order\r\nmust change, yielding place to a new. Every Trade Union has already\r\nbridged the Boyne. Every strike has already torn the Orange Flag and the\r\nGreen Flag into two pieces, and stitched them together again after a new\r\nand portentous pattern.\r\n\r\nWhat does it all come to? Simply this, that Ireland under Home Rule will\r\nbe most painfully like every other modern country of western\r\ncivilisation. Some Unionists think that, if they could only get rid of\r\nthe Irish Party, all would be for the best in the best of all possible\r\nworlds. Why then are they not Home Rulers? For Home Rule will most\r\nassuredly get rid of the Irish Party. It will shatter the old political\r\ncombinations like a waggon-load of dynamite. New groups will crystallise\r\nabout new principles. The future in Ireland belongs to no old fidelity:\r\nit may belong to any new courage.\r\n\r\nAssuredly we must not seem to suggest that, in an autonomous Ireland,\r\npublic life will be all nougat, velvet, and soft music. There will be\r\nconflicts, and vehement conflicts, for that is the way of the twentieth\r\ncentury, and they will no doubt centre, for the most part, about\r\ntaxation and education. But the political forces of the country will\r\nhave moved into totally new formations. One foresees plainly a vertical\r\nsection of parties into Agrarian and Urban, a cross section into Labour\r\nand Capitalistic. Each of these economic groupings is indefinitely\r\ncriss-crossed by an indefinite number of antagonisms, spiritual and\r\nmaterial. In a situation so complicated it is idle to speculate as to\r\nthe conditions of the future. A box of bricks so large, and so\r\nmulti-coloured, may be arranged and re-arranged in an infinity of\r\narchitectures. The one thing quite certain is that all the arrangements\r\nwill be new. In taxation, as I have suggested, a highly conservative\r\npolicy will prevail. In education the secularist programme, if advanced\r\nat all, will be overwhelmed by a junction of Catholic and Protestant.\r\nFor religion, to the _anima naturaliter Christiana_, of Ireland is not\r\nan argument but an intuition. It seems to us as reasonable to prepare\r\nchildren for their moral life by excluding religion as to prepare them\r\nfor their physical life by removing the most important lobe of their\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nThe only other prognostication that appears to emerge is the probable\r\npredominance in a Home Rule Ireland of the present Ulster Unionist\r\nparty. That group is likely, for many reasons, to retain its solidarity\r\nafter ours has been dissipated. Should that prove to be the case,\r\nself-government will put the balance of power on almost all great\r\nconflicts of opinion into the hands of Sir Edward Carson and his\r\nsuccessors. The \"minority,\" adroitly handled, will exploit the majority\r\nalmost as effectively after Home Rule as before it. Captain Craig will\r\ndictate terms to us not from the last ditch, but from a far more\r\nagreeable and powerful position, the Treasury Bench. And we undertake\r\nnot to grumble, for these are the chances of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAN EPILOGUE ON \"LOYALTY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to precedent, well-established if not wise, no discussion of\r\npolitical Ireland must end without some observations on \"loyalty.\" The\r\npassion of the English people for assurances on this point is in curious\r\ncontrast with their own record. It is not rhetoric, but crude history,\r\nto say that the title-deeds of English freedom are in great part written\r\nin blood, and that the seal which gave validity to all the capital\r\ndocuments was the seal of \"treason.\" No other nation in the world has so\r\nclearly recognised and so stoutly insisted that, in the ritual game of\r\nloyalty, the first move is with governments. With that premised, the\r\ndifference between the two countries is very simple. England has\r\ndeveloped from within the type of government that her people want. She\r\nexpresses satisfaction with the fact. This is loyalty. Ireland, on the\r\ncontrary, has had forced on her from without a type of government which\r\nher people emphatically do not want. She expresses dissatisfaction with\r\nthe fact. This is disloyalty. Loyalty, in brief, is the bloom on the\r\nface of freedom, just as beauty is the bloom on the face of health.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the methods by which England attained her very desirable\r\nposition we are further enlightened. It is a study admirably adapted to\r\ninculcate liberty, not at all so well adapted to inculcate \"loyalty.\"\r\nThe whole burden of English history is that, whenever these two\r\nprinciples came in conflict, every man in England worth his salt was\r\ndisloyal even to the point of war. Whenever the old bottle was\r\nrecalcitrant to the new wine of freedom it was ignominiously scrapped. A\r\nlong effort has been made to keep Irish history out of our schools in\r\nthe interests of \"loyalty.\" But it is English history that ought to be\r\nkept out, for it is full of stuff much more perilous. You teach Irish\r\nchildren the tale of Runnymede, covering with contempt the king of that\r\nday, and heaping praise on the barons who shook their fists under his\r\nnose. This is dangerous doctrine. It is doubly dangerous seeing that\r\nthese children will soon grow up to learn that the Great Charter, which\r\nis held to justify all these tumultuous proceedings, has never even to\r\nour own day been current law in Ireland. You introduce them to the Wars\r\nof the Roses as a model of peaceful, constitutional development; to the\r\nslaying of Edward II., Richard II., and I know not how many more as\r\nobject-lessons in the reverence which angry Englishmen accord to an\r\nanointed king when they really dislike him. Later centuries show them\r\none Stuart beheaded outside his own palace, another dethroned and\r\nbanished in favour of a Dutch prince. Of romantic loyalty to the person\r\nof a sovereign they find no trace or hint in the modern period. Lost\r\ncauses and setting suns, whatever appeal they may have made to Ireland,\r\ndo but rarely fire with their magical glimmer the raw daylight of the\r\nEnglish political mind. As for that more facile, after-dinner\r\nattachment, in which it is charged that we do not join with sufficient\r\nfervour, it seems to us always fulsome, and often mere hyprocrisy. In\r\nthe development of English ceremonial, \"God Save the King!\" gets to the\r\nhead of the toast-list only when the king has been thoroughly saved from\r\nall the perils and temptations incidental to the possession of power. So\r\nlong as he claims any shred of initiative his English subjects continue\r\nin a perpetual chafe and grumble of disloyalty; as soon as the Crown has\r\nbeen rasped and sand-papered down to a decorative zero their loyalty\r\nknows no bounds.\r\n\r\nThe simple and honourable truth is that all through her history England\r\nstrove after national freedom, and declined to be quiet until she got\r\nit. There could not be a better statement of the methods which she\r\nemployed than Mr Rudyard Kipling's:\r\n\r\n    \"Axe and torch and tumult, steel and gray-goose wing,\r\n    Wrung it, inch and ell, and all, slowly from the King.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a pity that the liberty thus established was better\r\nfitted for the home market than for export. But this does not affect the\r\nfact that, at the end of the process, the English people were in the\r\nsaddle. But the Irish people are not in the saddle, they are under it.\r\nIndeed, the capital sin of Dublin Castle is that it is a bureaucracy\r\nwhich has seized upon the estate of the people. In Ireland, under its\r\n_régime_, the nation has had as much to say to its own public policy as\r\na Durbar-elephant has to say to the future of India. There is just this\r\ndifference in favour of the elephant: at least he has riot to pay for\r\nthe embroidered palanquins, and the prodding-poles, of his riders. We\r\nare all agreed that loyalty is a duty. It is the duty of every\r\ngovernment to be loyal to the welfare, the nobler traditions, the\r\ndeep-rooted ideals, the habit of thought of its people. It is the duty\r\nof every government to be loyal to the idea of duty, and to that austere\r\njustice through which the most ancient heavens abide fresh and strong.\r\nAnd until these prime duties have been faithfully performed, no\r\ngovernment need expect and none can exact \"loyalty\" from its subjects.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that we are compromised on other grounds. The inscription\r\non the Parnell Memorial is trumpeted about the constituencies with equal\r\nenergy by opponents wise and otherwise:\r\n\r\n     \"No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation.\r\n     No man has a right to say to his country, 'Thus far shalt thou go\r\n     and no farther.' We have never attempted to fix the _ne plus ultra_\r\n     to the progress of Ireland's nationhood, and we never shall.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the precise matter of offence may be one finds it difficult to\r\ndiscover. Mr Balfour very properly characterises as the utterance of a\r\nstatesman, this passage in which Parnell declines to usurp the throne\r\nand sceptre of Providence. But Mr Smith complains that it deprives Home\r\nRule of the note of \"finality.\" With the suggestion that Home Rule is\r\nnot at all events the end of the world we are, of course, in warm\r\nagreement. But if Mr Smith has entered public affairs in pursuit of\r\nstatic formulæ for dynamic realities, if he wants things fixed and\r\nfrozen and final, he has come to the wrong world to gratify such\r\ndesires. And even if he were to go to the next, he would have to be very\r\ncareful in choosing his destination, for all the theologians tell us\r\nthat, in Heaven, personalities continue to grow and develop. In fact, if\r\nanybody wants \"finality,\" I am afraid that we can only recommend him to\r\ngo to Hell. As for the world, in which we live, it is a world of flux.\r\nPhysicists allow the earth a long road to travel before it tumbles into\r\ndissolution, and seers and prophets of various kinds foretell an equally\r\nlong cycle of development for human nature, as we now know it. The fate\r\nof all our present political combinations is doubtful, and no nation has\r\nreceived absolute guarantees for its future. An All-Europe State with\r\nits capital at London, a Federation of the World with its capital at\r\nDublin, a Chinese Empire with its capital at Paris--these are all\r\npossibilities. Australia may be annexed by Japan, Canada by the United\r\nStates, or vice versa; South Africa may spread northwards until it\r\nabsorbs the Continent, or shrink southwards until it expires on the\r\npoint of the Cape. The Superman may, as I am informed, appear on the\r\nstage of history at any moment, and make pie of everything. And not one\r\nof these appalling possibilities disturbs Mr Smith in the least. But he\r\nis going to vote against justice for Ireland unless we can promise him\r\nthat throughout all the æons, as yet unvouchsafed, and to the last\r\nsyllable of recorded time, her political destiny is going to be in all\r\ndetails regulated by the Home Rule Bill of 1912. This is not an\r\nintelligent attitude.\r\n\r\nOf course the real innuendo is that we in Ireland are burning to levy\r\nwar on Great Britain, and would welcome any foreign invasion to that\r\nend. On these two points one is happy to be able to give assurances, or\r\nrather to state intentions. As for foreign invasion, we have had quite\r\nenough of it. It is easier to get invaders in than to get them out\r\nagain, and we have not spent seven hundred years in recovering Ireland\r\nfor ourselves in order to make a present of it to the Germans, or the\r\nRussians, or the Man in the Moon, or any other foreign power whatever.\r\nThe present plan of governing Ireland in opposition to the will of her\r\npeople does indeed inevitably make that country the weak spot in the\r\ndefences of these islands, for such misgovernment produces discontent,\r\nand discontent is the best ally of the invader. Alter that by Home Rule,\r\nand your cause instantly becomes ours. Give the Irish nation an Irish\r\nState to defend, and the task of an invader becomes very unenviable. As\r\nfor levying war on Great Britain, we have no inclination in that\r\ndirection. The best thought in Ireland has always preferred civilisation\r\nto war, and we have no wealth to waste on expensive stupidities of any\r\nkind. In addition we are handicapped on sea by the smallness of our\r\nofficial navy which, so far as I can gather, consists of the\r\n_Granuaile_, a pleasure-boat owned by the Congested Districts Board. In\r\nland operations, we are still more seriously hampered by the\r\nnon-existence of our army. And although, in point of population, our\r\nnumerical inferiority is so trivial as one to ten, even this slight\r\ndisproportion may be regarded by an Irish Parliament as a fact not\r\nunworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nBut we must not suffer ourselves to be detained any longer among these\r\nunrealities. A Home Rule government will be loyal to the interests of\r\nits people, and actual circumstances demand, for the behoof of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland alike, an era of peace with honour, and friendship\r\nfounded on justice. The magnitude of the commercial relations between\r\nthe two countries is inadequately appreciated. Not merely is Great\r\nBritain our best customer, but we are her best customer. The trade of\r\nGreat Britain with Ireland is larger than her trade with India, and\r\nnearly twice as large as that with Canada or Australia. And while these\r\nsurprising figures are far from indicating the existence of a sound\r\neconomic structure in Ireland, none the less, the industrial expansion\r\nthat will follow Home Rule may be expected to alter the character rather\r\nthan to diminish the value of the goods interchanged. For if the\r\ndevelopment of textile, leather, shipbuilding, and other manufactures\r\nlessens the British import under these heads into Ireland, it will\r\nincrease that of coal, iron, steel, and machinery. And Ireland, without\r\ntrenching on the needs of her home market, is capable of much more\r\nintensive exploitation as a food-exporting country. Economically the two\r\nnations are joined in relations that ought to be relations of mutual\r\nprofit, were they not eternally poisoned by political oppression. With\r\nthis virus removed, the natural balance of the facts of nature will\r\nspontaneously establish itself between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe true desire of all the loud trumpeters of \"loyalty\" is, as it\r\nappears to me, of a very different order. What they really ask is that\r\nIreland should begin her career of autonomy with a formal act of\r\nself-humiliation. She may enter the Council of Empire provided that she\r\nenters on her knees, and leaves her history outside the door as a\r\nshameful burden. This is not a demand that can be conceded, or that men\r\nmake on men. The open secret of Ireland is that Ireland is a nation. In\r\ndays rougher than ours, when a blind and tyrannous England sought to\r\ndrown the national faith of Ireland in her own blood as in a sea, there\r\narose among our fathers men who annulled that design. We cannot\r\nundertake to cancel the names of these men from our calendar. We are no\r\nmore ashamed of them than the constitutional England of modern times is\r\nashamed of her Langtons and De Montforts, her Sidneys and Hampdens. Our\r\nattitude in their regard goes beyond the reach of prose, and no adequate\r\npoetry comes to my mind. The Irish poets have recently been so busy\r\ncompiling catalogues of crime, profanity, and mania for the Abbey\r\nTheatre that they have not had time to attend to politics; and in\r\nattempting to suggest the spirit that must inform the settlement between\r\nIreland and England, if out of it is to spring the authentic flower of\r\nloyalty, I am reluctantly compelled to fall back on a weaker brother,\r\nnot of the craft:\r\n\r\n    Bond, from the toil of hate we may not cease:\r\n    Free, we are free to be your friend.\r\n    But when you make your banquet, and we come,\r\n    Soldier with equal soldier must we sit,\r\n    Closing a battle, not forgetting it.\r\n    This mate and mother of valiant rebels dead\r\n    Must come with all her history or her head.\r\n    We keep the past for pride.\r\n    Nor war nor peace shall strike our poets dumb:\r\n    No rawest squad of all Death's volunteers,\r\n    No simplest man who died\r\n    To tear your flag down, in the bitter years,\r\n    But shall have praise, and three times thrice again,\r\n    When, at that table, men shall drink with men.\r\n\r\nAs political poetry, this may be open to amendment; as poetic politics,\r\nit is sound, decisive, and answerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHUMBERLAND PRESS, THORNTON STREET, NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Open Secret of Ireland, by T.
