Strenuous Life of the Tammany District Leader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nTHIS volume discloses the mental operations of perhaps the most\r\nthoroughly practical politician of the day--George Washington Plunkitt,\r\nTammany leader of the Fifteenth Assembly District, Sachem of the Tammany\r\nSociety and Chairman of the Elections Committee of Tammany Hall, who\r\nhas held the offices of State Senator, Assemblyman', Police Magistrate,\r\nCounty Supervisor and Alderman, and who boasts of his record in filling\r\nfour public offices in one year and drawing salaries from three of them\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nThe discourses that follow were delivered by him from his rostrum, the\r\nbootblack stand in the County Court-house, at various times in the\r\nlast half-dozen years. Their absolute frankness and vigorous\r\nunconventionality of thought and expression charmed me. Plunkitt said\r\nright out what all practical politicians think but are afraid to say.\r\nSome of the discourses I published as interviews in the New York Evening\r\nPost, the New York Sun, the New York World, and the Boston Transcript.\r\nThey were reproduced in newspapers throughout the country and several\r\nof them, notably the talks on \"The Curse of Civil Service Reform\" and\r\n\"Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft,\" became subjects of discussion in\r\nthe United States Senate and in college lectures. There seemed to be\r\na general recognition of Plunkitt as a striking type of the practical\r\npolitician, a politician, moreover, who dared to say publicly what\r\nothers in his class whisper among themselves in the City Hall corridors\r\nand the hotel lobbies.\r\n\r\nI thought it a pity to let Plunkitt's revelations of himself--as frank\r\nin their way as Rousseau's Confessions--perish in the files of the\r\nnewspapers; so I collected the talks I had published, added several new\r\nones, and now give to the world in this volume a system of political\r\nphilosophy which is as unique as it is refreshing.\r\n\r\nNo New Yorker needs to be informed who George Washington Plunkitt is.\r\nFor the information of others, the following sketch of his career is\r\ngiven. He was born, as he proudly tells, in Central Park--that is, in\r\nthe territory now included in the park. He began life as a driver of\r\na cart, then became a butcher's boy, and later went into the butcher\r\nbusiness for himself. How he entered politics he explains in one of his\r\ndiscourses. His advancement was rapid. He was in the Assembly soon after\r\nhe cast his first vote and has held office most of the time for forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, through a strange combination of circumstances, he held the\r\nplaces of Assemblyman, Alderman, Police Magistrate and County Supervisor\r\nand drew three salaries at once--a record unexampled in New York\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nPlunkitt is now a millionaire. He owes his fortune mainly to his\r\npolitical pull, as he confesses in \"Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft.\"\r\nHe is in the contracting, transportation, real estate, and every\r\nother business out of which he can make money. He has no office. His\r\nheadquarters is the County Courthouse bootblack stand. There he receives\r\nhis constituents, transacts his general business and pours forth his\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nPlunkitt has been one of the great powers in Tammany Hall for a quarter\r\nof a century. While he was in the Assembly and the State Senate he\r\nwas one of the most influential members and introduced the bills that\r\nprovided for the outlying parks of New York City, the Harlem River\r\nSpeedway, the Washington Bridge, the 155th Street Viaduct, the grading\r\nof Eighth Avenue north of Fifty-seventh Street, additions to the Museum\r\nof Natural History, the West Side Court, and many other important public\r\nimprovements. He is one of the closest friends and most valued advisers\r\nof Charles F. Murphy, leader of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nWilliam L. Riordon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tribute to Plunkitt by the Leader of Tammany Hall\r\n\r\nSENATOR PLUNKITT is a straight organization man. He believes in party\r\ngovernment; he does not indulge in cant and hypocrisy and he is never\r\nafraid to say exactly what he thinks. He is a believer in thorough\r\npolitical organization and all-the-year-around work, and he holds to the\r\ndoctrine that, in making appointments to office, party workers should\r\nbe preferred if they are fitted to perform the duties of the office.\r\nPlunkitt is one of the veteran leaders of the organization; he has\r\nalways been faithful and reliable, and he has performed valuable\r\nservices for Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. MURPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUNKITT OF TAMMANY HALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1. Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft\r\n\r\nEVERYBODY is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft,\r\nbut nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and\r\ndishonest graft. There's all the difference in the world between the\r\ntwo. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself.\r\nI've made a big fortune out of the game, and I'm gettin' richer every\r\nday, but I've not gone in for dishonest graft--blackmailin' gamblers,\r\nsaloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc.--and neither has any of the men\r\nwho have made big fortunes in politics.\r\n\r\nThere's an honest graft, and I'm an example of how it works. I might sum\r\nup the whole thing by sayin': \"I seen my opportunities and I took 'em.\"\r\n\r\nJust let me explain by examples. My party's in power in the city, and\r\nit's goin' to undertake a lot of public improvements. Well, I'm tipped\r\noff, say, that they're going to lay out a new park at a certain place.\r\n\r\nI see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all\r\nthe land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that makes\r\nits plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody cared\r\nparticular for before.\r\n\r\nAin't it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on my\r\ninvestment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that's honest graft.\r\n\r\nOr supposin' it's a new bridge they're goin' to build. I get tipped off\r\nand I buy as much property as I can that has to be taken for approaches.\r\nI sell at my own price later on and drop some more money in the bank.\r\n\r\nWouldn't you? It's just like lookin' ahead in Wall Street or in the\r\ncoffee or cotton market. It's honest graft, and I'm lookin' for it every\r\nday in the year. I will tell you frankly that I've got a good lot of it,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nI'll tell you of one case. They were goin' to fix up a big park, no\r\nmatter where. I got on to it, and went lookin' about for land in that\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nI could get nothin' at a bargain but a big piece of swamp, but I took it\r\nfast enough and held on to it. What turned out was just what I counted\r\non. They couldn't make the park complete without Plunkitt's swamp, and\r\nthey had to pay a good price for it. Anything dishonest in that?\r\n\r\nUp in the watershed I made some money, too. I bought up several bits of\r\nland there some years ago and made a pretty good guess that they would\r\nbe bought up for water purposes later by the city.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I always guessed about right, and shouldn't I enjoy the\r\nprofit of my foresight? It was rather amusin' when the condemnation\r\ncommissioners came along and found piece after piece of the land in the\r\nname of George Plunkitt of the Fifteenth Assembly District, New York\r\nCity. They wondered how I knew just what to buy. The answer is--I\r\nseen my opportunity and I took it. I haven't confined myself to land;\r\nanything that pays is in my line.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the city is repavin' a street and has several hundred\r\nthousand old granite blocks to sell. I am on hand to buy, and I know\r\njust what they are worth.\r\n\r\nHow? Never mind that. I had a sort of monopoly of this business for a\r\nwhile, but once a newspaper tried to do me. It got some outside men to\r\ncome over from Brooklyn and New Jersey to bid against me.\r\n\r\nWas I done? Not much. I went to each of the men and said: \"How many of\r\nthese 250,000 stories do you want?\" One said 20,000, and another wanted\r\n15,000, and other wanted 10,000. I said: \"All right, let me bid for the\r\nlot, and I'll give each of you all you want for nothin'.\"\r\n\r\nThey agreed, of course. Then the auctioneer yelled: \"How much am I bid\r\nfor these 250,000 fine pavin' stones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two dollars and fifty cents,\" says I.\r\n\r\n\"Two dollars and fifty cents!\" screamed the auctioneer. \"Oh, that's a\r\njoke! Give me a real bid.\"\r\n\r\nHe found the bid was real enough. My rivals stood silent. I got the\r\nlot for $2.50 and gave them their share. That's how the attempt to do\r\nPlunkitt ended, and that's how all such attempts end.\r\n\r\nI've told you how I got rich by honest graft. Now, let me tell you that\r\nmost politicians who are accused of robbin' the city get rich the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThey didn't steal a dollar from the city treasury. They just seen their\r\nopportunities and took them. That is why, when a reform administration\r\ncomes in and spends a half million dollars in tryin' to find the public\r\nrobberies they talked about in the campaign, they don't find them.\r\n\r\nThe books are always all right. The money in the city treasury is all\r\nright. Everything is all right. All they can show is that the Tammany\r\nheads of departments looked after their friends, within the law, and\r\ngave them what opportunities they could to make honest graft. Now, let\r\nme tell you that's never goin' to hurt Tammany with the people. Every\r\ngood man looks after his friends, and any man who doesn't isn't likely\r\nto be popular. If I have a good thing to hand out in private life, I\r\ngive it to a friend--Why shouldn't I do the same in public life?\r\n\r\nAnother kind of honest graft. Tammany has raised a good many salaries.\r\nThere was an awful howl by the reformers, but don't you know that\r\nTammany gains ten votes for every one it lost by salary raisin'?\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street banker thinks it shameful to raise a department clerk's\r\nsalary from $1500 to $1800 a year, but every man who draws a salary\r\nhimself says: \"That's all right. I wish it was me.\" And he feels\r\nvery much like votin' the Tammany ticket on election day, just out of\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nTammany was beat in 1901 because the people were deceived into believin'\r\nthat it worked dishonest graft. They didn't draw a distinction between\r\ndishonest and honest graft, but they saw that some Tammany men grew\r\nrich, and supposed they had been robbin' the city treasury or levyin'\r\nblackmail on disorderly houses, or workin' in with the gamblers and\r\nlawbreakers.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy, if nothing else, why should the Tammany leaders\r\ngo into such dirty business, when there is so much honest graft lyin'\r\naround when they are in power? Did you ever consider that?\r\n\r\nNow, in conclusion, I want to say that I don't own a dishonest dollar.\r\nIf my worst enemy was given the job of writin' my epitaph when I'm gone,\r\nhe couldn't do more than write:\r\n\r\n\"George W. Plunkitt. He Seen His Opportunities, and He Took 'Em.\"\r\n\r\nChapter 2. How to Become a Statesman\r\n\r\nTHERE'S thousands of young men in this city who will go to the polls for\r\nthe first time next November. Among them will be many who have watched\r\nthe careers of successful men in politics, and who are longin' to make\r\nnames and fortunes for themselves at the same game--It is to these\r\nyouths that I want to give advice. First, let me say that I am in a\r\nposition to give what the courts call expert testimony on the subject. I\r\ndon't think you can easily find a better example than I am of success\r\nin politics. After forty years' experience at the game I am--well, I'm\r\nGeorge Washington Plunkitt. Everybody knows what figure I cut in the\r\ngreatest organization on earth, and if you hear people say that I've\r\nlaid away a million or so since I was a butcher's boy in Washington\r\nMarket, don't come to me for an indignant denial I'm pretty comfortable,\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\nNow, havin' qualified as an expert, as the lawyers say, I am goin' to\r\ngive advice free to the young men who are goin' to cast their first\r\nvotes, and who are lookin' forward to political glory and lots of cash.\r\nSome young men think they can learn how to be successful in politics\r\nfrom books, and they cram their heads with all sorts of college rot.\r\nThey couldn't make a bigger mistake. Now, understand me I ain't sayin'\r\nnothin' against colleges. I guess they'll have to exist as long as\r\nthere's book-worms, and I suppose they do some good in a certain way,\r\nbut they don't count in politics. In fact, a young man who has gone\r\nthrough the college course is handicapped at the outset. He may succeed\r\nin politics, but the chances are 100 to 1 against him.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake: some young men think that the best way to prepare for\r\nthe political game is to practice speakin' and becomin' orators. That's\r\nall wrong. We've got some orators in Tammany Hall, but they're chiefly\r\nornamental. You never heard of Charlie Murphy delivering a speech, did\r\nyou? Or Richard Croker, or John Kelly, or any other man who has been a\r\nreal power in the organization? Look at the thirty-six district leaders\r\nof Tammany Hall today. How many of them travel on their tongues? Maybe\r\none or two, and they don't count when business is doin' at Tammany\r\nHall. The men who rule have practiced keepin' their tongues still, not\r\nexercisin' them. So you want to drop the orator idea unless you mean to\r\ngo into politics just to perform the skyrocket act.\r\n\r\nNow, I've told you what not to do; I guess I can explain best what to\r\ndo to succeed in politics by tellin' you what I did. After goin' through\r\nthe apprenticeship of the business while I was a boy by workin' around\r\nthe district headquarters and hustlin' about the polls on election day,\r\nI set out when I cast my first vote to win fame and money in New York\r\nCity politics. Did I offer my services to the district leader as a\r\nstump-speaker? Not much. The woods are always full of speakers. Did\r\nI get up a hook on municipal government and show it to the leader? I\r\nwasn't such a fool. What I did was to get some marketable goods before\r\ngoin' to the leaders. What do I mean by marketable goods? Let me tell\r\nyou: I had a cousin, a young man who didn't take any particular\r\ninterest in politics. I went to him and said: \"Tommy, I'm goin' to be a\r\npolitician, and I want to get a followin'; can I count on you?\" He said:\r\n\"Sure, George\". That's how I started in business. I got a marketable\r\ncommodity----one vote. Then I went to the district leader and told him\r\nI could command two votes on election day, Tommy's and my own. He\r\nsmiled on me and told me to go ahead. If I had offered him a speech or a\r\nbookful of learnin', he would have said, \"Oh, forget it!\"\r\n\r\nThat was beginnin' business in a small way, wasn't it? But that is the\r\nonly way to become a real lastin' statesman. I soon branched out. Two\r\nyoung men in the flat next to mine were school friends--I went to them,\r\njust as I went to Tommy, and they agreed to stand by me. Then I had a\r\nfollowin' of three voters and I began to get a bit chesty. Whenever I\r\ndropped into district head-quarters, everybody shook hands with me, and\r\nthe leader one day honored me by lightin' a match for my cigar. And so\r\nit went on like a snowball rollin' down a hill I worked the flat-house\r\nthat I lived in from the basement to the top floor, and I got about a\r\ndozen young men to follow me. Then I tackled the next house and so on\r\ndown the block and around the corner. Before long I had sixty men back\r\nof me, and formed the George Washington Plunkitt Association.\r\n\r\nWhat did the district leader say then when I called at headquarters? I\r\ndidn't have to call at headquarters. He came after me and said: \"George,\r\nwhat do you want? If you don't see what you want, ask for it. Wouldn't\r\nyou like to have a job or two in the departments for your friends?\"\r\nI said: \"I'll think it over; I haven't yet decided what the George\r\nWashington Plunkitt Association will do in the next campaign.\" You ought\r\nto have seen how I was courted and petted then by the leaders of the\r\nrival organizations I had marketable goods and there was bids for them\r\nfrom all sides, and I was a risin' man in politics. As time went on,\r\nand my association grew, I thought I would like to go to the Assembly.\r\n1 just had to hint at what I wanted, and three different organizations\r\noffered me the nomination. Afterwards, I went to the Board of Aldermen,\r\nthen to the State Senate, then became leader of the district, and so on\r\nup and up till I became a statesman.\r\n\r\nThat is the way and the only way to' make a lastin' success in politics.\r\nIf you are goin' to cast your first vote next November and want to go\r\ninto politics, do as I did. Get a followin', if it's only one man,\r\nand then go to the district leader and say: \"I want to join the\r\norganization. I've got one man who'll follow me through thick and thin.\"\r\nThe leader won't laugh at your one-man followin'. He'll shake your hand\r\nwarmly, offer to propose you for membership in his club, take you down\r\nto the corner for a drink and ask you to call again. But go to him\r\nand say: \"I took first prize at college in Aristotle; I can recite all\r\nShakespeare forwards and backwards; there ain't nothin' in science that\r\nain't as familiar to me as blockades on the elevated roads and I'm the\r\nreal thing in the way of silver-tongued orators.\" What will he answer?\r\nHe'll probably say: \"I guess you are not to blame for your misfortunes,\r\nbut we have no use for you here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3. The Curse of Civil Service Reform\r\n\r\nThis civil service law is the biggest fraud of the age. It is the curse\r\nof the nation. There can't be no real patriotism while it lasts. How\r\nare you goin' to interest our young men in their country if you have no\r\noffices to give them when they work for their party? Just look at things\r\nin this city today. There are ten thousand good offices, but we can't\r\nget at more than a few hundred of them. How are we goin' to provide\r\nfor the thousands of men who worked for the Tammany ticket? It can't be\r\ndone. These men were full of patriotism a short time ago. They expected\r\nto be servin' their city, but when we tell them that we can't place\r\nthem, do you think their patriotism is goin' to last? Not much. They\r\nsay: \"What's the use of workin' for your country anyhow? There's nothin'\r\nin the game.\" And what can they do? I don't know, but I'll tell you what\r\nI do know. I know more than one young man in past years who worked for\r\nthe ticket and was just overflowin' with patriotism, but when he was\r\nknocked out by the civil service humbug he got to hate his country and\r\nbecame an Anarchist.\r\n\r\nThis ain't no exaggeration. I have good reason for sayin' that most\r\nof the Anarchists in this city today are men who ran up against civil\r\nservice examinations. Isn't it enough to make a man sour on his country\r\nwhen he wants to serve it and won't be allowed unless he answers a\r\nlot of fool questions about the number of cubic inches of water in the\r\nAtlantic and the quality of sand in the Sahara desert? There was once a\r\nbright young man in my district who tackled one of these examinations.\r\nThe next I heard of him he had settled down in Herr Most's saloon\r\nsmokin' and drinkin' beer and talkin' socialism all day. Before that\r\ntime he had never drank anything but whisky. I knew what was comm' when\r\na young Irishman drops whisky and takes to beer and long pipes in a\r\nGerman saloon. That young man is today one of the wildest Anarchists in\r\ntown. And just to think! He might be a patriot but for that cussed civil\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSay, did you hear about that Civil Service Reform Association kickin'\r\nbecause the tax commissioners want to put their fifty-five deputies on\r\nthe exempt list, and fire the outfit left to them by Low? That's civil\r\nservice for you. Just think! Fifty-five Republicans and mugwumps holdin'\r\n$8000 and $4000 and $5000 jobs in the tax department when 1555 good\r\nTammany men are ready and willin' to take their places! It's an\r\noutrage! What did the people mean when they voted for Tammany? What\r\nis representative government, anyhow? Is it all a fake that this is a\r\ngovernment of the people, by the people and for the people? If it isn't\r\na fake, then why isn't the people's voice obeyed and Tammany men put in\r\nall the offices?\r\n\r\nWhen the people elected Tammany, they knew just what they were doin'.\r\nWe didn't put up any false pretenses. We didn't go in for humbug\r\ncivil service and all that rot. We stood as we have always stood, for\r\nreward--in' the men that won the victory. They call that the spoils\r\nsystem. All right; Tammany is for the spoils system, and when we go in\r\nwe fire every anti-Tammany man from office that can be fired under the\r\nlaw. It's an elastic sort of law and you can bet it will be stretched to\r\nthe limit Of course the Republican State Civil Service Board will\r\nstand in the way of our local Civil Service Commission all it can; but\r\nsay!--suppose we carry the State sometime, won't we fire the upstate\r\nBoard all right? Or we'll make it work in harmony with the local board,\r\nand that means that Tammany will get everything in sight. I know that\r\nthe civil service humbug is stuck into the constitution, too, but, as\r\nTim Campbell said: \"What's the constitution among friends?\"\r\n\r\nSay, the people's voice is smothered by the cursed civil service law;\r\nit is the root of all evil in our government. You hear of this thing or\r\nthat thing goin' wrong in the nation, the State or the city. Look down\r\nbeneath the surface and you can trace everything wrong to civil service.\r\nI have studied the subject and I know. The civil service humbug is\r\nunderminin' our institutions and if a halt ain't called soon this\r\ngreat republic will tumble down like a Park Avenue house when they\r\nwere buildin' the subway, and on its ruins will rise another Russian\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThis is an awful serious proposition. Free silver and the tariff and\r\nimperialism and the Panama Canal are triflin' issues when compared to\r\nit. We could worry along without any of these things, but civil service\r\nis sappin' the foundation of the whole shootin' match, let me argue it\r\nout for you. I ain't up on sillygisms, but I can give you some arguments\r\nthat nobody can answer.\r\n\r\nFirst, this great and glorious country was built up by political\r\nparties; second, parties can't hold together if their workers don't\r\nget the offices when they win; third, if the parties go to pieces, the\r\ngovernment they built up must go to pieces, too; fourth, then there'll\r\nbe h---- to pay.\r\n\r\nCould anything be clearer than that? Say, honest now; can you answer\r\nthat argument? Of course you won't deny that the government was built\r\nup by the great parties. That's history, and you can't go back of the\r\nreturns. As to my second proposition, you can't deny that either. When\r\nparties can't get offices, they'll bust. They ain't far from the bustin'\r\npoint now, with all this civil service business keepin' most of the good\r\nthings from them. How are you goin' to keep up patriotism if this thing\r\ngoes On? You can't do it. Let me tell you that patriotism has been dying\r\nout fast for the last twenty years. Before then when a party won,\r\nits workers got everything in sight. That was somethin' to make a man\r\npatriotic. Now, when a party wins and its men come forward and ask for\r\ntheir rewards, the reply is, \"Nothin' doin', unless you can answer a\r\nlist of questions about Egyptian mummies and how many years it will take\r\nfor a bird to wear out a mass of iron as big as the earth by steppin' on\r\nit once in a century?\"\r\n\r\nI have studied politics and men for forty-five years, and I see how\r\nthings are driftin'. Sad indeed is the change that has come over the\r\nyoung men, even in my district, where I try to keep up the fire of\r\npatriotism by gettin' a lot of jobs for my constituents, whether Tammany\r\nis in or out. The boys and men don't get excited any more when they see\r\na United States flag or hear \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" They don't care\r\nno more for firecrackers on the Fourth of July. And why should they?\r\nWhat is there in it for them? They know that no matter how hard they\r\nwork for their country in a campaign, the jobs will go to fellows who\r\ncan tell about the mummies and the bird steppin' on the iron. Are you\r\nsurprised then that the young men of the country are beginnin' to look\r\ncoldly on the flag and don't care to put up a nickel for firecrackers?\r\n\r\n15 The Curse of Civil Service Reform\r\n\r\nSay, let me tell of one case--After the battle of San Juan Hill, the\r\nAmericans found a dead man with a light complexion, red hair and blue\r\neyes. They could see he wasn't a Spaniard, although he had on a Spanish\r\nuniform. Several officers looked him over, and then a private of the\r\nSeventy-first Regiment saw him and yelled, \"Good Lord, that's Flaherty.\"\r\nThat man grew up in my district, and he was once the most patriotic\r\nAmerican boy on the West Side. He couldn't see a flag without yellin'\r\nhimself hoarse.\r\n\r\nNow, how did he come to be lying dead with a Spanish uniform on? I found\r\nout all about it, and I'll vouch for the story. Well, in the municipal\r\ncampaign of 1897, that young man, chockful of patriotism, worked day and\r\nnight for the Tammany ticket. Tammany won, and the young man determined\r\nto devote his life to the service of the city. He picked out a place\r\nthat would suit him, and sent in his application to the head of\r\ndepartment. He got a reply that he must take a civil service examination\r\nto get the place. He didn't know what these examinations were, so\r\nhe went, all lighthearted, to the Civil Service Board. He read the\r\nquestions about the mummies, the bird on the iron, and all the other\r\nfool questions--and he left that office an enemy of the country that he\r\nhad loved so well. The mummies and the bird blasted his patriotism. He\r\nwent to Cuba, enlisted in the Spanish army at the breakin' out of the\r\nwar, and died fightin' his country.\r\n\r\nThat is but one victim of the infamous civil service. If that young man\r\nhad not run up against the civil examination, but had been allowed to\r\nserve his country as he wished, he would be in a good office today,\r\ndrawin' a good salary. Ah, how many young men have had their patriotism\r\nblasted in the same way!\r\n\r\nNow, what is goin' to happen when civil service crushes out patriotism?\r\nOnly one thing can happen: the republic will go to pieces. Then a\r\nczar or a sultan will turn up, which brings me to the fourthly of my\r\nargument--that is, there will be h---- to pay. And that ain't no lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4. Reformers Only Mornin' Glories\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE professors and philosophers who go up in a balloon to think\r\nare always discussin' the question: \"Why Reform Administrations Never\r\nSucceed Themselves!\" The reason is plain to anybody who has learned the\r\na, b, c of politics.\r\n\r\nI can't tell just how many of these movements I've seen started in New\r\nYork during my forty years in politics, but I can tell you how many have\r\nlasted more than a few years--none. There have been reform committees\r\nof fifty, of sixty, of seventy, of one hundred and all sorts of numbers\r\nthat started Out to do up the regular political Organizations. They were\r\nmornin' glories--looked lovely in the mornin' and withered up in a short\r\ntime, while the regular machines went on flourishin' forever, like\r\nfine old oaks. Say, that's the first poetry I ever worked off. Ain't it\r\ngreat?\r\n\r\nJust look back a few years. You remember the People's Municipal League\r\nthat nominated Frank Scott for mayor in 1890? Do you remember the\r\nreformers that got up that league? Have you ever heard of them since? I\r\nhaven't. Scott himself survived because he had always been a first-rate\r\npolitician. But you'd have to look in the newspaper almanacs of 1891 to\r\nfind out who made up the People's Municipal League. Oh, yes! I remember\r\none name: Ollie Teall; dear, pretty Ollie and his big dog. They're about\r\nall that's left of the League.\r\n\r\nNow take the reform movement of 1894. A lot of good politicians joined\r\nin that--the Republicans, the State Democrats, the Stecklerites and the\r\nO'Brienites, and they gave us a lickin', but the real reform part of the\r\naffair, the Committee of Seventy that started the thing goin', what's\r\nbecome of those reformers? What's become of Charles Stewart Smith?\r\nWhere's Bangs? Do you ever hear of Cornell, the iron man, in politics\r\nnow? Could a search party find R. W. G. Welling? Have you seen the name\r\nof Fulton McMahon or McMahon Fulton--I ain't sure which--in the papers\r\nlately? Or Preble Tucker? Or--but it's no use to go through the list\r\nof the reformers who said they sounded in the death knell of Tammany in\r\n1894. They're gone for good, and Tammany's pretty well, thank you. They\r\ndid the talkin' and posin', and the politicians in the movement got all\r\nthe plums. It's always the case.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens' Union has lasted a little bit longer than the reform crowd\r\nthat went before them, but that's because they learned a thing or two\r\nfrom us. They learned how to put up a pretty good bluff--and bluff\r\nCounts a lot in politics. With only a few thousand members, they had the\r\nnerve to run the whole Fusion movement, make the Republicans and other\r\norganizations come to their headquarters to select a ticket and dictate\r\nwhat every candidate must do or not do. I love nerve, and I've had a\r\nsort of respect for the Citizens Union lately, but the Union can't last.\r\nIts people haven't been trained to politics, and whenever Tammany calls\r\ntheir bluff they lay right down. You'll never hear of the Union again\r\nafter a year or two.\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, what's become of the good government clubs, the\r\npolitical nurseries of a few years ago?\r\n\r\nDo you ever hear of Good Government Club D and P and Q and Z any more?\r\nWhat's become of the infants who were to grow up and show us how to\r\ngovern the city? I know what's become of the nursery that was started\r\nin my district. You can find pretty much the whole outfit over in my\r\nheadquarters, Washington Hall.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that a reformer can't last in politics. He can make a show\r\nfor a while, but he always comes down like a rocket. Politics is as much\r\na regular business as the grocery or the dry-goods or the drug business.\r\nYou've got to be trained up to it or you're sure to fail. Suppose a man\r\nwho knew nothing about the grocery trade suddenly went into the business\r\nand tried to conduct it according to his own ideas. Wouldn't he make a\r\nmess of it? He might make a splurge for a while, as long as his money\r\nlasted, but his store would soon be empty. It's just the same with\r\na reformer. He hasn't been brought up in the difficult business of\r\npolitics and he makes a mess of it every time.\r\n\r\nI've been studyin' the political game for forty-five years, and! don't\r\nknow it all yet. I'm learnin' somethin' all the time. How, then, can you\r\nexpect what they call \"business men\" to turn into politics all at\r\nonce and make a success of it? It is just as if I went up to Columbia\r\nUniversity and started to teach Greek. They usually last about as long\r\nin politics as I would last at Columbia.\r\n\r\nYou can't begin too early in politics if you want to succeed at the\r\ngame. I began several years before I could vote, and so did every\r\nsuccessful leader in Tammany Hall. When I was twelve years old I made\r\nmyself useful around the district headquarters and did work at all the\r\npolls on election day. Later on, I hustled about gettin' out voters who\r\nhad jags on or who were too lazy to come to the polls. There's a hundred\r\nways that boys can help, and they get an experience that's the\r\nfirst real step in statesmanship. Show me a boy that hustles for the\r\norganization on election day, and I'll show you a comin' statesman.\r\n\r\nThat's the a, b, c of politics. It ain't easy work to get up to q and\r\nz. You have to give nearly all your time and attention to it. Of course,\r\nyou may have some business or occupation on the side, but the great\r\nbusiness of your life must be politics if you want to succeed in it.\r\nA few years ago Tammany tried to mix politics and business in equal\r\nquantities, by havin' two leaders for each district, a politician and\r\na business man. They wouldn't mix. They were like oil and water. The\r\npolitician looked after the politics of his district; the business\r\nman looked after his grocery store or his milk route, and whenever he\r\nappeared at an executive meeting, it was only to make trouble. The whole\r\nscheme turned out to be a farce and was abandoned mighty quick.\r\n\r\nDo you understand now, why it is that a reformer goes down and out in\r\nthe first or second round, while a politician answers to the gong every\r\ntime? It is because the one has gone into the fight without trainin',\r\nwhile the other trains all the time and knows every fine point of the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5. New York City Is Pie for the Hayseeds\r\n\r\nTHIS city is ruled entirely by the hayseed legislators at Albany. I've\r\nnever known an upstate Republican who didn't want to run things\r\nhere, and I've met many thousands of them in my long service in the\r\nLegislature. The hayseeds think we are like the Indians to the National\r\nGovernment--that is, sort of wards of the State, who don't know how to\r\nlook after ourselves and have to be taken care of by the Republicans of\r\nSt. Lawrence, Ontario, and other backwoods counties. Why should anybody\r\nbe surprised because ex-Governor Odell comes down here to direct the\r\nRepublican machine? Newburg ain't big enough for him. He, like all the\r\nother upstate Republicans, wants to get hold of New York City. New York\r\nis their pie.\r\n\r\nSay, you hear a lot about the downtrodden people of Ireland and the\r\nRussian peasants and the sufferin' Boers. Now, let me tell you that they\r\nhave more real freedom and home rule than the people of this grand and\r\nimperial city. In England, for example, they make a pretense of givin'\r\nthe Irish some self-government In this State the Republican government\r\nmakes no pretense at all. It says right out in the open: \"New York City\r\nis a nice big fat Goose. Come along with your carvin' knives and have a\r\nslice.\" They don't pretend to ask the Goose's consent.\r\n\r\nWe don't own our streets or our docks or our waterfront or anything\r\nelse. The Republican Legislature and Governor run the whole shootin'\r\nmatch. We've got to eat and drink what they tell us to eat and drink,\r\nand have got to choose our time for eatin' and drinkin' to suit them. If\r\nthey don't feel like takin' a glass of beer on Sunday, we must abstain.\r\nIf they have not got any amusements up in their backwoods, we mustn't\r\nhave none. We've got to regulate our whole lives to suit them. And then\r\nwe have to pay their taxes to boot.\r\n\r\nDid you ever go up to Albany from this city with a delegation that\r\nwanted anything from the Legislature? No? Well, don't. The hayseeds\r\nwho run all the committees will look at you as if you were a child that\r\ndidn't know what it wanted, and will tell you in so many words to go\r\nhome and be good and the Legislature will give you whatever it thinks is\r\ngood for you. They put on a sort of patronizing air, as much as to say,\r\n\"These children are an awful lot of trouble. They're wantin' candy all\r\nthe time, and they know that it will make them sick. They ought to thank\r\ngoodness that they have us to take care of them.\" And if you try to\r\nargue with them, they'll smile in a pityin' sort of way as if they were\r\nhumorin' a spoiled child.\r\n\r\nBut just let a Republican farmer from Chemung or Wayne or Tioga turn up\r\nat the Capital. The Republican Legislature will make a rush for him and\r\nask him what he wants and tell him if he doesn't see what he wants to\r\nask for it. If he says his taxes are too high, they reply to him: \"All\r\nright, old man, don't let that worry you. How much do you want us to\r\ntake off?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess about fifty per cent will about do for the present,\" says the\r\nman. \"Can you fix me up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" the Legislature agrees. \"Give us somethin', 'New York City Is Pie\r\nfor the Hayseeds,' try harder, don't be bashful. We'll take off sixty\r\nper. cent. if you wish. That's what we're here for.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Legislature goes and passes a law increasin' the liquor tax or\r\nsome other tax in New York City, takes a half of the proceeds for the\r\nState Treasury and cuts down the farmers' taxes to suit. It's as easy\r\nas rollin' off a log--when you've got a good workin' majority and no\r\nconscience to speak of.\r\n\r\nLet me give you another example. It makes me hot under the collar to\r\ntell about this. Last year some hay-seeds along the Hudson River, mostly\r\nin Odell's neighborhood, got dissatisfied with the docks where they\r\nlanded their vegetables, brickbats, and other things they produce in the\r\nriver counties. They got together and said: \"Let's take a trip down\r\nto New York and pick out the finest dock we can find. Odell and the\r\nLegislature will do the rest.\" They did come down here, and what do\r\nyou think they hit on? The finest dock in my district Invaded George W.\r\nPlunkitt's district without sayin' as much as \"by your leave.\" Then they\r\ncalled on Odell to put through a bill givin' them this dock, and he did.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill came before Mayor Low I made the greatest speech of my\r\nlife. I pointed out how the Legislature could give the whole waterfront\r\nto the hayseeds over the head of the Dock Commissioner in the same way,\r\nand warned the Mayor that nations had rebelled against their governments\r\nfor less. But it was no go. Odell and Low were pards and--well, my dock\r\nwas stolen.\r\n\r\nYou heard a lot in the State campaign about Odell's great work in\r\nreducin' the State tax to almost nothin', and you'll hear a lot more\r\nabout it in the campaign next year. How did he do it? By cuttin' down\r\nthe expenses of the State Government? Oh, no! The expenses went up. He\r\nsimply performed the old Republican act of milkin' New York City. The\r\nonly difference was that he nearly milked the city dry. He not only ran\r\nup the liquor tax, but put all sorts of taxes on corporations, banks,\r\ninsurance companies, and everything in sight that could be made to give\r\nup. Of course, nearly the whole tax fell on the city. Then Odell went\r\nthrough the country districts and said: \"See what I have done for you.\r\nYou ain't got any more taxes to pay the State. Ain't I a fine feller?\"\r\n\r\nOnce a farmer in Orange County asked him: \"How did you do it, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead easy,\" he answered. \"Whenever I want any money for the State\r\nTreasury, I know where to get it,\" and he pointed toward New York City.\r\n\r\nAnd then all the Republican tinkerin' with New York City's charter.\r\nNobody can keep up with it. When a Republican mayor is in, they give him\r\nall sorts of power. If a Tammany mayor is elected next fall I wouldn't\r\nbe surprised if they changed the whole business and arranged it so that\r\nevery city department should have four heads, two of them Republicans.\r\nIf we make a kick, they would say: \"You don't know what's good for you.\r\nLeave it to us. It's our business.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6. To Hold Your District: Study Human Nature and Act Accordin'\r\n\r\nThere's only one way to hold a district: you must study human nature\r\nand act accordin'. You can't study human nature in books. Books is a\r\nhindrance more than anything else. If you have been to college, so much\r\nthe worse for you. You'll have to unlearn all you learned before you can\r\nget right down to human nature, and unlearnin' takes a lot of time. Some\r\nmen can never forget what they learned at college. Such men may get to\r\nbe district leaders by a fluke, but they never last.\r\n\r\nTo learn real human nature you have to go among the people, see them and\r\nbe seen..1 know every man, woman, and child in the Fifteenth District,\r\nexcept them that's been born this summer--and I know some of them, too.\r\nI know what they like and what they don't like, what they are strong at\r\nand what they are weak in, and I reach them by approachin' at the right\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here's how I gather in the young men. I hear of a young\r\nfeller that's proud of his voice, thinks that he can sing fine. I ask\r\nhim to come around to Washington Hall and join our Glee Club. He comes\r\nand sings, and he's a follower of Plunkitt for life. Another young\r\nfeller gains a reputation as a baseball player in a vacant lot. I bring\r\nhim into our baseball dub. That fixes him. You'll find him workin' for\r\nmy ticket at the polls next election day. Then there's the feller that\r\nlikes rowin' on the river, the young feller that makes a name as a\r\nwaltzer on his block, the young feller that's handy with his dukes--I\r\nrope them all in by givin' them opportunities to show themselves off.\r\nI don't trouble them with political arguments. I just study human nature\r\nand act accordin'.\r\n\r\nBut you may say this game won't work with the high-toned fellers, the\r\nfellers that go through college and then join the Citizens' Union. Of\r\ncourse it wouldn't work. I have a special treatment for them. I ain't\r\nlike the patent medicine man that gives the same medicine for all\r\ndiseases. The Citizens' Union kind of a young man! I love him! He's the\r\ndaintiest morsel of the lot, and he don't often escape me.\r\n\r\nBefore telling you how I catch him, let me mention that before the\r\nelection last year, the Citizens' Union said they had four hundred\r\nor five hundred enrolled voters in my district. They had a lovely\r\nheadquarters, too, beautiful roll-top desks and the cutest rugs in the\r\nworld. If I was accused of havin' contributed to fix up the nest for\r\nthem, I wouldn't deny it under oath. What do I mean by that? Never mind.\r\nYou can guess from the sequel, if you're sharp.\r\n\r\nWell, election day came. The Citizens' Union's candidate for Senator,\r\nwho ran against me, just polled five votes in the district, while I\r\npolled something more than 14,000 votes. What became of the 400 or 500\r\nCitizens' Union enrolled voters in my district? Some people guessed that\r\nmany of them were good Plunkitt men all along and worked with the Cits\r\njust to bring them into the Plunkitt camp by election day. You can guess\r\nthat way, too, if you want to. I never contradict stories about me,\r\nespecially in hot weather. I just call your attention to the fact that\r\non last election day 395 Citizens' Union enrolled voters in my district\r\nwere missin' and unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nI tell you frankly, though, how I have captured some of the Citizens'\r\nUnion's young men. I have a plan that never fails. I watch the City\r\nRecord to see when there's civil service examinations for good things.\r\nThen I take my young Cit in hand, tell him all about the good thing and\r\nget him worked up till he goes and takes an examination. I don't bother\r\nabout him any more. It's a cinch that he comes back to me in a few days\r\nand asks to join Tammany Hall. Come over to Washington Hall some night\r\nand I'll show you a list of names on our roll' marked \"C.S.\" which\r\nmeans, \"bucked up against civil service.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the older voters, I reach them, too. No, I don't send them\r\ncampaign literature. That's rot. People can get all the political stuff\r\nthey want to read--and a good deal more, too--in the papers. Who reads\r\nspeeches, nowadays, anyhow? It's bad enough to listen to them. You\r\nain't goin' to gain any votes by stuffin' the letter boxes with campaign\r\ndocuments. Like as not you'll lose votes for there's nothin' a man hates\r\nmore than to hear the letter carrier ring his bell and go to the letter\r\nbox ex pectin' to find a letter he was lookin' for, and find only a lot\r\nof printed politics. I met a man this very mornin' who told me he voted\r\nthe Democratic State ticket last year just because the Republicans kept\r\ncrammin' his letter box with campaign documents.\r\n\r\nWhat tells in holdin' your grip on your district is to go right down\r\namong the poor families and help them in the different ways they need\r\nhelp. I've got a regular system for this. If there's a fire in Ninth,\r\nTenth, or Eleventh Avenue, for example, any hour of the day or night,\r\nI'm usually there with some of my election district captains as soon as\r\nthe fire engines. If a family is burned out I don't ask whether they\r\nare Republicans or Democrats, and I don't refer them to the Charity\r\nOrganization Society, which would investigate their case in a month or\r\ntwo and decide they were worthy of help about the time they are dead\r\nfrom starvation. I just get quarters for them, buy clothes for them\r\nif their clothes were burned up, and fix them up till they get things\r\nrunnin' again. It's philanthropy, but it's politics, too--mighty good\r\npolitics. Who can tell how many votes one of these fires bring me? The\r\npoor are the most grateful people in the world, and, let me tell you,\r\nthey have more friends in their neighborhoods than the rich have in\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nIf there's a family in my district in want I know it before the\r\ncharitable societies do, and me and my men are first on the ground. I\r\nhave a special corps to look up such cases. The consequence is that\r\nthe poor look up to George W. Plunkitt as a father, come to him in\r\ntrouble--and don't forget him on election day.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, I can always get a job for a deservin' man. I make it a\r\npoint to keep on the track of jobs, and it seldom happens that I don't\r\nhave a few up my sleeve ready for use. I know every big employer in the\r\ndistrict and in the whole city, for that matter, and they ain't in the\r\nhabit of sayin' no to me when I ask them for a job.\r\n\r\nAnd the children--the little roses of the district! Do I forget them?\r\nOh, no! They know me, every one of them, and they know that a sight of\r\nUncle George and candy means the same thing. Some of them are the best\r\nkind of vote-getters. I'll tell you a case. Last year a little Eleventh\r\nAvenue rosebud, whose father is a Republican, caught hold of his\r\nwhiskers on election day and said she wouldn't let go till he'd promise\r\nto vote for me. And she didn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7. On The Shame of the Cities\r\n\r\nI'VE been readin' a book by Lincoln Steffens on 'The Shame of the Cities'.\r\nSteffens means well but, like all reformers, he don't know how to\r\nmake distinctions. He can't see no difference between honest graft and\r\ndishonest graft and, consequent, he gets things all mixed up. There's\r\nthe biggest kind of a difference between political looters and\r\npoliticians who make a fortune out of politics by keepin' their eyes\r\nwide open. The looter goes in for himself alone without considerin' his\r\norganization or his city. The politician looks after his own interests,\r\nthe organization's interests, and the city's interests all at the same\r\ntime. See the distinction? For instance, I ain't no looter. The looter\r\nhogs it. I never hogged. I made my pile in politics, but, at the same\r\ntime, 1 served the organization and got more big improvements for New\r\nYork City than any other livin' man. And I never monkeyed with the penal\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a looter and a practical politician is the\r\ndifference between the Philadelphia Republican gang and Tammany Hall.\r\nSteffens seems to think they're both about the same; but he's all wrong.\r\nThe Philadelphia crowd runs up against the penal code. Tammany don't.\r\nThe Philadelphians ain't satisfied with robbin' the bank of all its gold\r\nand paper money. They stay to pick up the nickels and pennies and the\r\ncop comes and nabs them. Tammany ain't no such fool. Why, I remember,\r\nabout fifteen or twenty years ago, a Republican superintendent of the\r\nPhiladelphia almshouse stole the zinc roof off the buildin' and sold\r\nit for junk. That was carryin' things to excess. There's a limit to\r\neverything, and the Philadelphia Republicans go beyond the limit. It\r\nseems like they can't be cool and moderate like real politicians. It\r\nain't fair, therefore, to class Tammany men with the Philadelphia gang.\r\nAny man who undertakes to write political books should never for a\r\nmoment lose sight of the distinction between honest graft and dishonest\r\ngraft, which I explained in full in another talk. If he puts all kinds\r\nof graft on the same level, he'll make the fatal mistake that Steffens\r\nmade and spoil his book.\r\n\r\nA big city like New York or Philadelphia or Chicago might be compared\r\nto a sort of Garden of Eden, from a political point of view. It's an\r\norchard full of beautiful apple trees. One of them has got a big sign\r\non it, marked: \"Penal Code Tree--Poison.\" The other trees have lots of\r\napples on them for all. Yet the fools go to the Penal Code Tree. Why?\r\nFor the reason, I guess, that a cranky child refuses to eat good food\r\nand chews up a box of matches with relish. I never had any temptation to\r\ntouch the Penal Code Tree. The other apples are good enough for me, and\r\n0 Lord! how many of them there are in a big city!\r\n\r\nSteffens made one good point in his book. He said he found that\r\nPhiladelphia, ruled almost entirely by Americans, was more corrupt than\r\nNew York, where the Irish do almost all the governin'. I could have told\r\nhim that before he did any investigatin' if he had come to me. The Irish\r\nwas born to rule, and they're the honestest people in the world. Show me\r\nthe Irishman who would steal a roof off an almhouse! He don't exist.\r\nOf course, if an Irishman had the political pull and the roof was much\r\nworn, he might get the city authorities to put on a new one and get the\r\ncontract for it himself, and buy the old roof at a bargain--but that's\r\nhonest graft. It's goin' about the thing like a gentleman, and there's\r\nmore money in it than in tearin' down an old roof and cartin' it to the\r\njunkman's--more money and no penal code.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the Irishman is more honest in politics than many Sons of\r\nthe Revolution is that he is grateful to the country and the city that\r\ngave him protection and prosperity when he was driven by oppression from\r\nthe Emerald Isle. Say, that sentence is fine, ain't it? I'm goin' to get\r\nsome literary feller to work it over into poetry for next St. Patrick's\r\nDay dinner.\r\n\r\nYes, the Irishman is grateful. His one thought is to serve the city\r\nwhich gave him a home. He has this thought even before he lands in New\r\nYork, for his friends here often have a good place in one of the city\r\ndepartments picked out for him while he is still in the old country. Is\r\nit any wonder that he has a tender spot in his heart for old New York\r\nwhen he is on its salary list the mornin' after he lands?\r\n\r\nNow, a few words on the general subject of the so called shame of\r\ncities. I don't believe that the government of our cities is any worse,\r\nin proportion to opportunities, than it was fifty years ago. I'll\r\nexplain what I mean by \"in proportion to opportunities.\" A half\r\na century ago, our cities were small and poor. There wasn't many\r\ntemptations lyin' around for politicians. There was hardly anything to\r\nsteal, and hardly any opportunities for even honest graft. A city could\r\ncount its money every night before goin' to bed, and if three cents\r\nwas missin', all the fire bells would be rung. What credit was there in\r\nbein' honest under them circumstances'? It makes me tired to hear of old\r\ncodgers back in the thirties or forties boastin' that they retired from\r\npolitics without a dollar except what they earned in their profession or\r\nbusiness. If they lived today, with all the existin' opportunities, they\r\nwould be just the same as twentieth-century politicians. There ain't any\r\nmore honest people in the world just now than the convicts in Sing\r\nSing. Not one of them steals anything. Why? Because they can't. See the\r\napplication?\r\n\r\nUnderstand, I ain't defendin' politicians of today who steal. The\r\npolitician who steals is worse than a thief. He is a fool. With the\r\ngrand opportunities all around for the man with a political pull,\r\nthere's no excuse for stealin' a cent. The point I want to make is\r\nthat if there is some stealin' in politics, it don't mean that the\r\npoliticians of 1905 are, as a class, worse than them of 1835. It just\r\nmeans that the old-timers had nothin' to steal, while the politicians\r\nnow are surrounded by all kinds of temptations and some of them\r\nnaturally--the fool ones--buck up against the penal code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8. Ingratitude in Politics\r\n\r\nTHERE's no crime so mean as ingratitude in politics, but every great\r\nstatesman from the beginnin' of the world has been up against it. Caesar\r\nhad his Brutus; that king of Shakespeare's--Leary, I think you call\r\nhim--had his own daughters go back on him; Platt had his Odell, and\r\nI've got my \"The\" McManus. It's a real proof that a man is great when\r\nhe meets with political ingratitude. Great men have a tender, trustin'\r\nnature. So have I, outside of the contractin' and real estate business.\r\nIn politics I have trusted men who have told me they were my friends,\r\nand if traitors have turned up in my camp well, I only had the same\r\nexperience as Caesar, Leary, and the others. About my Brutus. McManus,\r\nyou know, has seven brothers and they call him \"The\" because he is the\r\nboss of the lot, and to distinguish him from all other McManuses.\r\nFor several years he was a political bushwhacker. In campaigns he\r\nwas sometimes on the fence, sometimes on both sides of the fence,\r\nand sometimes under the fence. Nobody knew where to find him at any\r\nparticular time, and nobody trusted him--that is, nobody but me. I\r\nthought there was some good in him after all and that, if I took him in\r\nhand, I could make a man of him yet.\r\n\r\nI did take him in hand, a few years ago. My friends told me it would be\r\nthe Brutus Leary business all over again, but I didn't believe them.\r\nI put my trust in \"The.\" I nominated him for the Assembly, and he\r\nwas elected. A year afterwards, when I was runnin' for re-election as\r\nSenator, I nominated him for the Assembly again on the ticket with\r\nme. What do you think happened? We both carried the Fifteenth Assembly\r\nDistrict, but he ran away ahead of me. Just think! Ahead of me in my\r\nown district! I was just dazed. When I began to recover, my election\r\ndistrict captains came to me and said that McManus had sold me out\r\nwith the idea of knockin' me out of the Senatorship, and then tryin'\r\nto capture the leadership of the district. I couldn't believe it. My\r\ntrustin' nature couldn't imagine such treachery.\r\n\r\nI sent for McManus and said, with my voice tremblin' with emotions:\r\n\"They say you have done me dirt, 'The.' It can't be true. Tell me it\r\nain't true.\"\r\n\r\n\"The\" almost wept as he said he was innocent.\r\n\r\n\"Never have I done you dirt, George,\" he declared. \"Wicked traitors have\r\ntried to do you. I don't know just who they are yet, but I'm on their\r\ntrail, and I'll find them or abjure the name of 'The' McManus. I'm goin'\r\nout right now to find them.\"\r\n\r\nWell, \"The\" kept his word as far as goin' out and findin' the traitors\r\nwas concerned. He found them all right--and put himself at their\r\nhead. Oh, no! He didn't have to go far to look for them. He's got them\r\ngathered in his clubrooms now, and he's doin' his best to take the\r\nleadership from the man that made him. So you see that Caesar and Leary\r\nand me's in the same boat, only I'll come out on top while Caesar and\r\nLeary went under.\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you that the ingrate in politics never flourishes long.\r\nI can give you lots of examples. Look at the men who done up Roscoe\r\nConkling when he resigned from the United States Senate and went to\r\nAlbany to ask for re-election! What's become of them? Passed from view\r\nlike a movin' picture. Who took Conkling's place in the Senate? Twenty\r\ndollars even that you can't remember his name without looking in the\r\nalmanac. And poor old Plattt He's down and out now and Odell is in the\r\nsaddle, but that don't mean that he'll always be in the saddle. His\r\nenemies are workin' hard all the time to do him, and I wouldn't be a bit\r\nsurprised if he went out before the next State campaign.\r\n\r\nThe politicians who make a lastin' success in politics are the men who\r\nare always loyal to their friends, even up to the gate of State prison,\r\nif necessary; men who keep their promises and never lie. Richard Croker\r\nused to say that tellin' the truth and stickin' to his friends was the\r\npolitical leader's stock in trade. Nobody ever said anything truer, and\r\nnobody lived up to it better than Croker. That is why he remained leader\r\nof Tammany Hall as long as he wanted to. Every man in the organization\r\ntrusted him. Sometimes he made mistakes that hurt in campaigns, but they\r\nwere always on the side of servin' his friends.\r\n\r\nIt's the same with Charles F. Murphy. He has always stood by his friends\r\neven when it looked like he would be downed for doin' so. Remember how\r\nhe stuck to McClellan in 1903 when all the Brooklyn leaders were against\r\nhim, and it seemed as if Tammany was in for a grand smash-up! It's men\r\nlike Croker and Murphy that stay leaders as long as they live; not men\r\nlike Brutus and McManus.\r\n\r\nNow I want to tell you why political traitors, in New York City\r\nespecially, are punished quick. It's because the Irish are in a\r\nmajority. The Irish, above all people in the world, hates a traitor.\r\nYou can't hold them back when a traitor of any kind is in sight and,\r\nrememberin' old Ireland, they take particular delight in doin' up a\r\npolitical traitor. Most of the voters in my district are Irish or of\r\nIrish descent; they've spotted \"The\" McManus, and when they get a chance\r\nat him at the polls next time, they won't do a thing to him.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked: Is a politician ever justified in going'\r\nback on his district leader? I answer: \"No; as long as the leader\r\nhustles around and gets all the jobs possible for his constituents.\"\r\nWhen the voters elect a man leader, they make a sort of a contract with\r\nhim. They say, although it ain't written out: \"We've put you here to\r\nlook out for our Interests. You want to see that this district gets all\r\nthe jobs that's comm' to it. Be faithful to us, and we'll be faithful to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe district leader promises and that makes a solemn contract. If he\r\nlives up to it, spends most of his time chasm' after places in the\r\ndepartments, picks up jobs from railroads and contractors for his\r\nfollowers, and shows himself in all ways a true statesman, then his\r\nfollowers are bound in honor to uphold him, just as they're bound to\r\nuphold the Constitution of the United States. But if he only looks after\r\nhis own interests or shows no talent for scenting out jobs or ain't\r\ngot the nerve to demand and get his share of the good things that are\r\ngoing', his followers may be absolved from their allegiance and they may\r\nup and swat him without bein' put down as political ingrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9. Reciprocity in Patronage\r\n\r\nWHENEVER Tammany is whipped at the polls, the people set to predictin'\r\nthat the organization is going' to smash. They say we can't get along\r\nwithout the offices and that the district leaders are going' to desert\r\nwholesale. That was what was said after the throwdowns in 1894 and 1901.\r\nBut it didn't happen, did it? Not one big Tammany man deserted, and\r\ntoday the organization is stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nHow was that? It was because Tammany has more than one string to its\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that you can't keep an organization together without\r\npatronage. Men ain't in politics for nothin'. They want to get somethin'\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nBut there is more than one kind of patronage. We lost the public kind,\r\nor a greater part of it, in 1901, but Tammany has an immense private\r\npatronage that keeps things going' when it gets a setback at the polls.\r\n\r\nTake me, for instance. When Low came in, some of my men lost public\r\njobs, but I fixed them all right. I don't know how many jobs I got for\r\nthem on the surface and elevated railroads--several hundred.\r\n\r\nI placed a lot more on public works done by contractors, and no Tammany\r\nman goes hungry in my district. Plunkitt's O.K. on an application for\r\na job is never turned down, for they all know that Plunkitt and Tammany\r\ndon't stay out long. See!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, too, that I got jobs from Republicans in\r\noffice--Federal and otherwise. When Tammany's on top I do good turns for\r\nthe Republicans. When they're on top they don't forget me.\r\n\r\nMe and the Republicans are enemies just one day in the year--election\r\nday. Then we fight tooth and nail The rest of the time it's live and let\r\nlive with us.\r\n\r\nOn election day I try to pile up as big a majority as I can against\r\nGeorge Wanmaker, the Republican leader of the Fifteenth. Any other day\r\nGeorge and I are the best of friends. I can go to him and say: \"George,\r\nI want you to place this friend of mine.\" He says: \"Mi right, Senator.\"\r\nOr vice versa.\r\n\r\nYou see, we differ on tariffs and currencies and all them things, but\r\nwe agree on the main proposition that when a man works in politics, he\r\nshould get something out of it.\r\n\r\nThe politicians have got to stand together this way or there wouldn't\r\nbe any political parties in a short time. Civil service would gobble up\r\neverything, politicians would be on the bum, the republic would fall and\r\nsoon there would be the cry of \"Vevey le roil\".\r\n\r\nThe very thought of this civil service monster makes my blood boil. I\r\nhave said a lot about it already, but another instance of its awful work\r\njust occurs to me.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a sad but true story. Last Wednesday a line of carriages\r\nwound into Cavalry Cemetery. I was in one of them. It was the funeral of\r\na young man from my district--a bright boy that I had great hopes of.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to school, he was the most patriotic boy in the district.\r\nNobody could sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" like him, nobody was as\r\nfond of waving a flag, and nobody shot off as many firecrackers on the\r\nFourth of July. And when he grew up he made up his mind to serve his\r\ncountry in one of the city departments. There was no way of gettin'\r\nthere without passin' a civil service examination. Well, he went down to\r\nthe civil service office and tackled the fool questions. I saw him next\r\nday--it was Memorial Day, and soldiers were marchin' and flags flyin'\r\nand people cheerin'.\r\n\r\nWhere was my young man? Standin' on the corner, scowlin' at the whole\r\nshow. When I asked him why he was so quiet, he laughed in a wild sort of\r\nway and said: \"What rot all this is!\"\r\n\r\nJust then a band came along playing \"Liberty.\" He laughed wild again and\r\nsaid: \"Liberty? Rats!\"\r\n\r\nI don't guess I need to make a long story of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that young man left the civil service office he lost all\r\npatriotism. He didn't care no more for his country. He went to the\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nHe ain't the only one. There's a gravestone over some bright young man's\r\nhead for every one of them infernal civil service examinations. They\r\nare underminin' the manhood of the nation and makin' the Declaration\r\nof Independence a farce. We need a new Declaration of Independence,\r\nindependence of the whole fool civil service business.\r\n\r\nI mention all this now to show why it is that the politicians of two big\r\nparties help each other along, and why Tammany men are tolerably happy\r\nwhen not in power in the city. When we win I won't let any deservin'\r\nRepublican in my neighborhood suffer from hunger or thirst, although, of\r\ncourse, I look out for my own people first.\r\n\r\nNow, I've never gone in for nonpartisan business, but I do think that\r\nall the leaders of the two parties should get together and make an open,\r\nnonpartisan fight against civil service, their common enemy. They\r\ncould keep up their quarrels about imperialism and free silver and high\r\ntariff. They don't count for much alongside of civil service, which\r\nstrikes right at the root of the government. The time is fast coming\r\nwhen civil service or the politicians will have to go. And it will be\r\nhere sooner than they expect if the politicians don't unite, drop all\r\nthem minor issues for a while and make a stand against the civil service\r\nflood that's sweepin' over the country like them floods out West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10. Brooklynites Natural-Born Hayseeds\r\n\r\nSOME people are wonderin' why it is that the Brooklyn Democrats have\r\nbeen sidin' with David B. Hill and the upstate crowd. There's no cause\r\nfor wonder. I have made a careful study of the Brooklynite, and I can\r\ntell you why. It's because a Brooklynite is a natural-born hay. seed,\r\nand can never become a real New Yorker. He can't be trained into it.\r\nConsolidation didn't make him a New Yorker, and nothin' on earth can. A\r\nman born in Germany can settle down and become a good New Yorker. So\r\ncan an Irishman; in fact, the first word an Irish boy learns in the old\r\ncountry is \"New York,\" and when he grows up and comes here, he is at\r\nhome right away. Even a Jap or a Chinaman can become a New Yorker, but a\r\nBrooklynite never can.\r\n\r\nAnd why? Because Brooklyn don't seem to be like any other place on\r\nearth. Once let a man grow up amidst Brooklyn's cobblestones, with the\r\nodor of Newton Creek and Gowanus Canal ever in his nostrils, and there's\r\nno place in the world for him except Brooklyn. And even if he don't grow\r\nup there; if he is born there and lives there only in his boyhood and\r\nthen moves away, he is still beyond redemption. In one of my speeches\r\nin the Legislature, I gave an example of this, and it's worth repeatin'\r\nnow. Soon after I became a leader on the West Side, a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, I came across a bright boy, about seven years old, who had\r\njust been brought over from Brooklyn by his parents. I took an interest\r\nin the boy, and when he grew up I brought him into politics. Finally, I\r\nsent him to the Assembly from my district Now remember that the boy was\r\nonly seven years old when he left Brooklyn, and was twenty-three when he\r\nwent to the Assembly. You'd think he had forgotten all about Brooklyn,\r\nwouldn't you? I did, but I was dead wrong. When that young fellow got\r\ninto the Assembly he paid no attention to bills or debates about New\r\nYork City. He didn't even show any interest in his own district. But\r\njust let Brooklyn be mentioned, or a bill be introduced about Gowanus\r\nCanal, or the Long Island Railroad, and he was all attention. Nothin'\r\nelse on earth interested him.\r\n\r\nThe end came when I caught him--what do you think I caught him at? One\r\nmornin' I went over from the Senate to the Assembly chamber, and there I\r\nfound my young man readin'--actually readin' a Brooklyn newspaper!\r\nWhen he saw me comm' he tried to hide the paper, but it was too late.\r\nI caught him dead to rights, and I said to him: \"Jimmy, I'm afraid\r\nNew York ain't fascinatin' enough for you. You had better move back to\r\nBrooklyn after your present term.\" And he did. I met him the other day\r\ncrossin' the Brooklyn Bridge, carryin' a hobbyhorse under one arm, and a\r\ndoll's carriage under the other, and lookin' perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nMcCarren and his men are the same way. They can't get it into their\r\nheads that they are New Yorkers, and just tend naturally toward\r\nsupportin' Hill and his hay-seeds against Murphy. I had some hopes of\r\nMcCarren till lately. He spends so much of his time over here and has\r\nseen so much of the world that I thought he might be an exception, and\r\ngrow out of his Brooklyn surroundings, but his course at Albany shows\r\nthat there is no exception to the rule. Say, I'd rather take a Hottentot\r\nin hand to bring up as a good New Yorker than undertake the job with a\r\nBrooklynite. Honest, I would.\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, come to think of it, is there really any upstate\r\nDemocrats left? It has never been proved to my satisfaction that there\r\nis any. I know that some upstate members of the State committee call\r\nthemselves Democrats. Besides these, I know at least six more men above\r\nthe Bronx who make a livin' out of professin' to be Democrats, and I\r\nhave just heard of some few more. But if there is any real Democrats up\r\nthe State, what becomes of them on election day? They certainly don't\r\ngo near the polls or they vote the Republican ticket. Look at the last\r\nthree State elections! Roosevelt piled up more than 100,000 majority\r\nabove the Bronx; Odell piled up about 160,000 majority the first time\r\nhe ran and 131,000 the second time. About all the Democratic votes cast\r\nwere polled in New York City. The Republicans can get all the votes they\r\nwant up the State. Even when we piled up 123,000 majority for Coler in\r\nthe city In 1902, the Republicans went it 8000 better above the Bronx.\r\n\r\nThat's why it makes me mad to hear about upstate Democrats controllin'\r\nour State convention, and sayin' who we shall choose for President.\r\nIt's just like Staten Island undertakin' to dictate to a New York City\r\nconvention. I remember once a Syracuse man came to Richard Croker at\r\nthe Democratic Club, handed him a letter of introduction and said: \"I'm\r\nlookin' for a job in the Street Cleanin' Department; I'm backed by a\r\nhundred upstate Democrats.\" Croker looked hard at the man a minute and\r\nthen said: \"Upstate Democrats! Upstate Democrats! I didn't know there\r\nwas any upstate Democrats. Just walk up and down a while till I see what\r\nan upstate Democrat looks like.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing. When a campaign is on, did you ever hear of an upstate\r\nDemocrat makin' a contribution? Not much. Tammany has had to foot the\r\nwhole bill, and when any of Hill's men came down to New York to help\r\nhim in the campaign, we had to pay their board. Whenever money is to be\r\nraised, there's nothin' doin' up the State. The Democrats there--always\r\nprovidin' that there is any Democrats there--take to the woods.\r\nSupposin' Tammany turned over the campaigns to the Hill men and then\r\nheld off, what would happen? Why, they would have to hire a shed out in\r\nthe suburbs of Albany for a headquarters, unless the Democratic National\r\nCommittee put up for the campaign expenses. Tammany's got the votes and\r\nthe cash. The Hill crowd's only got hot air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11. Tammany Leaders Not Bookworms\r\n\r\nYou hear a lot of talk about the Tammany district leaders bein'\r\nilliterate men. If illiterate means havin' common sense, we plead\r\nguilty. But if they mean that the Tammany leaders ain't got no education\r\nand ain't gents they don't know what they're talkin' about. Of course,\r\nwe ain't all bookworms and college professors. If we were, Tammany might\r\nwin an election once in four thousand years. Most of the leaders are\r\nplain American citizens, of the people and near to the people, and they\r\nhave all the education they need to whip the dudes who part their name\r\nin the middle and to run the City Government. We've got bookworms, too,\r\nin the organization. But we don't make them district leaders. We keep\r\nthem for ornaments on parade days.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall is a great big machine, with every part adjusted delicate\r\nto do its own particular work. It runs so smooth that you wouldn't think\r\nit was a complicated affair, but it is. Every district leader is fitted\r\nto the district he runs and he wouldn't exactly fit any other district.\r\nThat's the reason Tammany never makes the mistake the Fusion outfit\r\nalways makes of sendin' men into the districts who don't know the\r\npeople, and have no sympathy with their peculiarities--We don't put a\r\nsilk stockin' on the Bowery, nor do we make a man who is handy with his\r\nfists leader of the Twenty-ninth. The Fusionists make about the same\r\nsort of a mistake that a repeater made at an election in Albany several\r\nyears ago. He was hired to go to the polls early in a half-dozen\r\nelection districts and vote on other men's names before these men\r\nreached the polls. At one place, when he was asked his name by the poll\r\nclerk, he had the nerve to answer \"William Croswell Doane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come off. You ain't Bishop Doane,\" said the poll clerk.\r\n\r\n\"The hell I ain't, you--I\" yelled the repeater.\r\n\r\nNow, that is the sort of bad judgment the Fusionists are guilty of. They\r\ndon't pick men to suit the work they have to do.\r\n\r\nTake me, for instance. My district, the Fifteenth, is made up of all\r\nsorts of people, and a cosmopolitan is needed to run it successful. I'm\r\na cosmopolitan. When I get into the silk-stockin' part of the district,\r\nI can talk grammar and all that with the best of them. I went to school\r\nthree winters when I was a boy, and I learned a lot of fancy stuff that\r\nI keep for occasions. There ain't a silk stockin' in the district who\r\nain't proud to be seen talkin' with George Washington Plunkitt, and\r\nmaybe they learn a thing or two from their talks with me. There's one\r\nman in the district, a big banker, who said to me one day: \"George,\r\nyou can sling the most vigorous English I ever heard. You remind me of\r\nSenator Hoar of Massachusetts.\" Of course, that was puttin' it on too\r\nthick; but say, honest, I like Senator Hoar's speeches. He once quoted\r\nin the United States Senate some of my remarks on the curse of civil\r\nservice, and, though he didn't agree with me altogether, I noticed\r\nthat our ideas are alike in some things, and we both have the knack of\r\nputtin' things strong, only he put on more frills to suit his audience.\r\n\r\nAs for the common people of the district, I am at home with them at all\r\ntimes. When I go among them, I don't try to show off my grammar, or talk\r\nabout the Constitution, or how many volts there is in electricity or\r\nmake it appear in any way that I am better educated than they are. They\r\nwouldn't stand for that sort of thing. No; I drop all monkeyshines.\r\nSo you see, I've got to be several sorts of a man in a single day, a\r\nlightnin' change artist, so to speak. But I am one sort of man always\r\nin one respect: I stick to my friends high and low, do them a good\r\nturn whenever I get a chance, and hunt up all the jobs going for my\r\nconstituents. There ain't a man in New York who's got such a scent for\r\npolitical jobs as I have. When I get up in the mornin' I can almost\r\ntell every time whether a job has become vacant over night, and what\r\ndepartment it's in and I'm the first man on the ground to get it. Only\r\nlast week I turned up at the office of Water Register Savage at 9\r\nA.M. and told him I wanted a vacant place in his office for one of my\r\nconstituents. \"How did you know that O'Brien had got out?\" he asked me.\r\n\"I smelled it in the air when I got up this mornin',\" I answered. Now,\r\nthat was the fact. I didn't know there was a man in the department named\r\nO'Brien, much less that he had got out, but my scent led me to the Water\r\nRegister's office, and it don't often lead me wrong.\r\n\r\nA cosmopolitan ain't needed in all the other districts, but our men are\r\njust the kind to rule. There's Dan Finn, in the Battery district, bluff,\r\njolly Dan, who is now on the bench. Maybe you'd think that a court\r\njustice is not the man to hold a district like that, but you're\r\nmistaken. Most of the voters of the district are the janitors of the big\r\noffice buildings on lower Broadway and their helpers. These janitors are\r\nthe most dignified and haughtiest of men. Even I would have trouble in\r\nholding them. Nothin' less than a judge on the bench is good enough for\r\nthem. Dan does the dignity act with the janitors, and when he is with\r\nthe boys he hangs up the ermine in the closet and becomes a jolly good\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nBig Tom Foley, leader of the Second District, fits in exactly, too. Tom\r\nsells whisky, and good whisky, and he is able to take care of himself\r\nagainst a half dozen thugs if he runs up against them on Cherry Hill or\r\nin Chatharn Square. Pat Ryder and Johnnie Ahearn of the Third and Fourth\r\nDistricts are just the men for the places. Ahearn's constituents are\r\nabout half Irishmen and half Jews. He is as popular with one race\r\nas with the other. He eats corned beef and kosher meat with equal\r\nnonchalance, and it's all the same to him whether he takes off his hat\r\nin the church or pulls it down over his ears in the synagogue.\r\n\r\nThe other downtown leaders, Barney Martin of the Fifth, Tim Sullivan of\r\nthe Sixth, Pat Keahon of the Seventh, Florrie Sullivan of the Eighth,\r\nFrank Goodwin of the Ninth, Julius Harburger of the Tenth, Pete Dooling\r\nof the Eleventh, Joe Scully of the Twelfth, Johnnie Oakley of the\r\nFourteenth, and Pat Keenan of the Sixteenth are just built to suit the\r\npeople they have to deal with. They don't go in for literary business\r\nmuch downtown, but these men are all real gents, and that's what the\r\npeople want--even the poorest tenement dwellers. As you go farther\r\nuptown you find a rather different kind of district leader. There's\r\nVictor Dowling who was until lately the leader of the Twenty-fourth.\r\nHe's a lulu. He knows the Latin grammar backward. What's strange, he's\r\na sensible young fellow, too. About once in a century we come across\r\na fellow like that in Tammany politics. James J. Martin, leader of the\r\nTwenty-seventh, is also something of a hightoner and publishes a law\r\npaper, while Thomas E. Rush, of the Twenty-ninth, is a lawyer, and Isaac\r\nHopper, of the Thirty-first, is a big contractor. The downtown leaders\r\nwouldn't do uptown, and vice versa. So, you see, these fool critics\r\ndon't know what they're talkin' about when they criticize Tammany Hall,\r\nthe most perfect political machine on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12. Dangers of the Dress Suit in Politics\r\n\r\nPUTIN' on style don't pay in politics. The people won't stand for it. If\r\nyou've got an achin' for style, sit down on it till you have made your\r\npile and landed a Supreme Court Justiceship with a fourteen-year term at\r\n$17,000 a year, or some job of that kind. Then you've got about all you\r\ncan get out of politics, and you can afford to wear a dress suit all day\r\nand sleep in it all night if you have a mind to. But, before you have\r\ncaught onto your life meal ticket, be simple. Live like your neighbors\r\neven if you have the means to live better. Make the poorest man in your\r\ndistrict feel that he is your equal, or even a bit superior to you.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, avoid a dress suit. You have no idea of the harm\r\nthat dress suits have done in politics. They are not so fatal to young\r\npoliticians as civil service reform and drink, but they have scores of\r\nvictims. I will mention one sad case. After the big Tammany victory\r\nin 1897, Richard Croker went down to Lakewood to make up the slate of\r\noffices for Mayor Van Wyck to distribute. All the district leaders and\r\nmany more Tammany men went down there, too, to pick up anything good\r\nthat was goin.' There was nothin' but dress suits at dinner at Lakewood,\r\nand Croker wouldn't let any Tammany men go to dinner without them. Well,\r\na bright young West Side politician, who held a three-thousan dollar job\r\nin one of the departments, went to Lakewood to ask Croker for something\r\nbetter. He wore a dress suit for the first time in his hie. It was his\r\nundoin'. He got stuck on himself. He thought he looked too beautiful for\r\nanything, and when he came home he was a changed man. As soon as he got\r\nto his house every evenin' he put on that dress Suit and set around in\r\nit until bedtime. That didn't satisfy him long. He wanted others to see\r\nhow beautiful he was in a dress suit; so he joined dancin' clubs and\r\nbegan goin' to all the balls that was given in town. Soon he began\r\nto neglect his family. Then he took to drinkin', and didn't pay any\r\nattention to his political work in the district. The end came in less\r\nthan a year. He was dismissed from the department and went to the dogs.\r\nThe other day I met him rigged out almost like a hobo, but he still\r\nhad a dress-suit vest on. When I asked him what he was doin', he said:\r\n\"Nothin' at present, but I got a promise of a job enrollin' voters at\r\nCitizens' Union head-quarters.\" Yes, a dress Suit had brought him that\r\nlow!\r\n\r\nI'll tell you another case right in my own Assembly District. A few\r\nyears ago I had as one of my lieutenants a man named Zeke Thompson. He\r\ndid fine work for me and I thought he had a bright future. One day he\r\ncame to me, said he intended to buy an option on a house, and asked me\r\nto help him out. I like to see a young man acquirin' property and I had\r\nso much confidence in Zeke that I put up for him on the house.\r\n\r\nA month or so afterwards I heard strange rumors. People told me that\r\nZeke was beginnin' to put on style. They said he had a billiard table in\r\nhis house and had hired Jap servants. I couldn't believe it. The idea\r\nof a Democrat, a follower of George Washington Plunkitt in the Fifteenth\r\nAssembly District havin' a billiard table and Jap servants! One mornin'\r\nI called at the house to give Zeke a chance to clear himself. A Jap\r\nopened the door for me. I saw the billiard table--Zeke was guilty! When\r\nI got over the shock, I said to Zeke: \"You are caught with the goods on.\r\nNo excuses will go. The Democrats of this district ain't used to dukes\r\nand princes and we wouldn't feel comfortable in your company. You'd\r\noverpower us. You had better move up to the Nineteenth or Twenty-seventh\r\nDistrict, and hang a silk stocking on your door.\" He went up to the\r\nNineteenth, turned Republican, and was lookin' for an Albany job the\r\nlast I heard of him.\r\n\r\nNow, nobody ever saw me puttin' on any style. I'm the same Plunkitt I\r\nwas when I entered politics forty years ago. That is why the people of\r\nthe district have confidence in me. If I went into the stylish business,\r\neven I, Plunkitt, might be thrown down in the district. That was shown\r\npretty clearly in the senatorial fight last year. A day before the\r\nelection, my enemies circulated a report that I had ordered a $10,000\r\nautomobile and a $125 dress suit. I sent out contradictions as fast as\r\nI could, but I wasn't able to stamp out the infamous slander before the\r\nvotin' was over, and I suffered some at the polls. The people wouldn't\r\nhave minded much if I had been accused of robbin' the city treasury, for\r\nthey're used to slanders of that kind in campaigns, but the automobile\r\nand the dress suit were too much for them.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that people won't stand for is showin' off your learnin'.\r\nThat's just puttin' on style in another way. If you're makin' speeches\r\nin a campaign, talk the language the people talk. Don't try to show how\r\nthe situation is by quotin' Shakespeare. Shakespeare was all right in\r\nhis way, but he didn't know anything about Fifteenth District politics.\r\nIf you know Latin and Greek and have a hankerin' to work them off on\r\nsomebody, hire a stranger to come to your house and listen to you for a\r\ncouple of hours; then go out and talk the language of the Fifteenth to\r\nthe people. I know it's an awful temptation, the hankerin' to show off\r\nyour learnin'. I've felt it myself, but I always resist it. I know the\r\nawful consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13. On Municipal Ownership\r\n\r\nI AM for municipal ownership on one condition: that the civil service\r\nlaw be repealed. It's a grand idea--the city the railroads, the gas\r\nworks and all that. Just see how many thousands of new places there\r\nwould be for the workers in Tammany. Why, there would be almost enough\r\nto go around, if no civil service law stood in the way. My plan is this:\r\nfirst get rid of that infamous law, and then go ahead and by degrees get\r\nmunicipal ownership.\r\n\r\nSome of the reformers are sayin' that municipal ownership won't do\r\nbecause it would give a lot of patronage to the politicians. How those\r\nfellows mix things up when they argue! They're givin' the strongest\r\nargument in favor of municipal ownership when they say that. Who is\r\nbetter fitted to run the railroads and the gas plants and the ferries\r\nthan the men who make a business of lookin' after the interests of the\r\ncity? Who is more anxious to serve the city? Who needs the jobs more?\r\n\r\nLook at the Dock Department! The city owns the docks, and how beautiful\r\nTammany manages them! I can't tell you how many places they provide for\r\nour workers. I know there is a lot of talk about dock graft, but that\r\ntalk comes from the outs. When the Republicans had the docks under Low\r\nand Strong, you didn't hear them sayin' anything about graft, did you?\r\nNo; they' just went in and made hay while the sun shone--That's always\r\nthe case. When the reformers are out they raise the yell that Tammany\r\nmen should be sent to jail. When they get in, they're so busy keepin'\r\nout of jail themselves that they don't have no time to attack Tammany.\r\n\r\nAll I want is that municipal ownership be postponed till I get my bill\r\nrepealin' the civil service law before the next legislature. It would be\r\nall a mess if every man who wanted a job would have to run up against\r\na civil service examination. For instance, if a man wanted a job as\r\nmotorman on a surface car, it's ten to one that they would ask him: \"Who\r\nwrote the Latin grammar, and, if so, why did he write it? How many years\r\nwere you at college? Is there any part of the Greek language you don't\r\nknow? State all you don't know, and why you don't know it. Give a list\r\nof all the sciences with full particulars about each one and how it came\r\nto be discovered. Write out word for word the last ten decisions of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court and show if they conflict with the last ten\r\ndecisions of the police courts of New York City.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the would-be motorman left the civil service room, the chances\r\nare he would be a raving lunatic Anyhow I wouldn't like to ride on his\r\ncar. Just here I want to say one last final word about civil service.\r\nIn the last ten years I have made an investigation which I've kept quiet\r\ntill this time. Now I have all the figures together, and I'm ready to\r\nannounce the result. My investigation was to find out how many civil\r\nservice reformers and how many politicians were in state prisons. I\r\ndiscovered that there was forty per cent more civil service reformers\r\namong the jailbirds. If any legislative committee wants the detailed\r\nfigures, I'll prove what I say. I don't want to give the figures now,\r\nbecause I want to keep them to back me up when I go to Albany to get\r\nthe civil service law repealed. Don't you think that when I've had my\r\ninning, the civil service law will go down, and the people will see that\r\nthe politicians are all right, and that they ought to have the job of\r\nrunnin' things when municipal ownership comes?\r\n\r\nOne thing more about municipal ownership. If the city owned the\r\nrailroads, etc., salaries would be sure to go up. Higher salaries is\r\nthe cryin' need of the day. Municipal ownership would increase them all\r\nalong the line and would stir up such patriotism as New York City never\r\nknew before. You can't be patriotic on a salary that just keeps the wolf\r\nfrom the door. Any man who pretends he can will bear watchin'. Keep your\r\nhand on your watch and pocketbook when he's about. But, when a man has\r\na good fat salary, he finds himself hummin' \"Hail Columbia,\" all\r\nunconscious and he fancies, when he's ridin' in a trolley car, that the\r\nwheels are always sayin': \"Yankee Doodle Came to Town.\" I know how it is\r\nmyself. When I got my first good job from the city I bought up all the\r\nfirecrackers in my district to salute this glorious country. I couldn't\r\nwait for the Fourth of July 1 got the boys on the block to fire them\r\noff for me, and I felt proud of bein' an American. For a long time after\r\nthat I use to wake up nights singin' \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14. Tammany the Only Lastin' Democracy\r\n\r\nI've seen more than one hundred \"Democracies\" rise and fall in New\r\nYork City in the last quarter of a century. At least a half-dozen new\r\nso-called Democratic organizations are formed every year. All of them go\r\nin to down Tammany and take its place, but they seldom last more than\r\na year or two, while Tammany's like the everlastin' rocks, the eternal\r\nhills and the blockades on the \"L\" road--it goes on forever.\r\n\r\nI recall offhand the County Democracy, which was the only real opponent\r\nTammany has had in my time, the Irving Hall Democracy, the New\r\nYork State Democracy, the German-American Democracy, the Protection\r\nDemocracy, the Independent County Democracy, the Greater New York\r\nDemocracy, the Jimmy O'Brien Democracy, the Delicatessen Dealers'\r\nDemocracy, the Silver Democracy, and the Italian Democracy. Not one of\r\nthem is livin' today, although I hear somethin' about the ghost of the\r\nGreater New York Democracy bein' seen on Broadway once or twice a year.\r\n\r\nIn the old days of the County Democracy, a new Democratic organization\r\nmeant some trouble for Tammany--for a time anyhow. Nowadays a new\r\nDemocracy means nothin' at all except that about a dozen bone-hunters\r\nhave got together for one campaign only to try to induce Tammany to give\r\nthem a job or two, or in order to get in with the reformers for the same\r\npurpose. You might think that it would cost a lot of money to get up\r\none of these organizations and keep it goin' for even one campaign,\r\nbut, Lord bless you! it costs next to nothin'. Jimmy O'Brien brought the\r\nmanufacture of \"Democracies\" down to an exact science, and reduced the\r\ncost of production so as to bring it within the reach of all. Any man\r\nwith $50 can now have a \"Democracy\" of his own.\r\n\r\nI've looked into the industry, and can give rock-bottom figures. Here's\r\nthe items of cost of a new \"Democracy\r\n\r\n     A dinner to twelve bone-hunters                          $12.00\r\n     A speech on Jeffersonian Democracy                        00.00\r\n     A proclamation of principles (typewriting)                 2.00\r\n     Rent of a small room one month for headquarters           12.00\r\n     Stationery                                                 2.00\r\n     Twelve secondhand chairs                                   6.00\r\n     One secondhand table                                       2.00\r\n     Twenty-nine cuspidors                                      9.00\r\n     Sign painting                                              5.00\r\n     Total                                                     ------\r\n                                                              $50.00\r\n\r\nIs there any reason for wonder, then, that \"Democracies\" spring up all\r\nover when a municipal campaign is comm' on? If you land even one small\r\njob, you get a big return on your investment. You don't have to pay for\r\nadvertisin' in the papers. The New York papers tumble over one another\r\nto give columns to any new organization that comes out against Tammany.\r\nIn describin' the formation of a \"Democracy\" on the $50 basis, accordin'\r\nto the items I give, the papers would say somethin' like this: \"The\r\norganization of the Delicatessen Democracy last night threatens the\r\nexistence of Tammany Hall. It is a grand move for a new and pure\r\nDemocracy in this city. Well may the Tammany leaders be alarmed; panic\r\nhas already broke loose in Fourteenth Street. The vast crowd that\r\ngathered at the launching of the new organization, the stirrin' speeches\r\nand the proclamation of principles mean that, at last, there is an\r\nuprisin' that will end Tammany's career of corruption. The Delicatessen\r\nDemocracy will open in a few days spacious headquarters where all true\r\nDemocrats may gather and prepare for the fight.\"\r\n\r\nSay, ain't some of the papers awful gullible about politics? Talk\r\nabout come-ons from Iowa or Texas they ain't in it with the childlike\r\nsimplicity of these papers.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonder to me that more men don't go into this kind of\r\nmanufacturin' industry. It has bigger profits generally than the\r\ngreen-goods business and none of the risks. And you don't have to invest\r\nas much as the green-goods men. Just see what good things some of these\r\n\"Democracies\" got in the last few years! The New York State Democracy in\r\n1897 landed a Supreme Court Justiceship for the man who manufactured the\r\nconcern--a fourteen-year term at $17,500 a year, that is $245,000. You\r\nsee, Tammany was rather scared that year and was bluffed into givin'\r\nthis job to get the support of the State Democracy which, by the way,\r\nwent out of business quick and prompt the day after it got this big\r\nplum. The next year the German Democracy landed a place of the same\r\nkind. And then see how the Greater New York Democracy worked the game\r\non the reformers in 1901! The men who managed this concern were former\r\nTammanyites who had lost their grip; yet they made the Citizens' Union\r\ninnocents believe that they were the real thing in the way of reformers,\r\nand that they had 100,000 voter back of them. They got the Borough\r\nPresident of Manhattan, the President of the Board of Aldermen, the\r\nRegister and a lot of lesser places, it was the greatest bunco game of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 1894, when Strong was elected mayor, what a harvest it\r\nwas for all the little \"Democracies\", that was made to order that year!\r\nEvery one of them got somethin' good. In one case, all the nine men in\r\nan organization got jobs payin' from $2000 to $5000. I happen to know\r\nexactly what it cost to manufacture that organization. It was $42.04.\r\nThey left out the stationery, and had only twenty-three cuspidors. The\r\nextra four cents was for two postage stamps.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can imagine why more men don't go into this industry\r\nis because they don't know about it. And just here it strikes me that\r\nit might not be wise to publish what I've said. Perhaps if it gets to\r\nbe known what a snap this manufacture of \"Democracies\" is, all the\r\ngreen-goods men, the bunco-steerers, and the young Napoleons of finance\r\nwill go into it and the public will be humbugged more than it has been.\r\nBut, after all, what difference would it make? There's always a certain\r\nnumber of suckers and a certain number of men lookin' for a chance to\r\ntake them in, and the suckers are sure to be took one way or another.\r\nIt's the everlastin' law of demand and supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15. Concerning Gas in Politics\r\n\r\nSINCE the eighty-cent gas bill was defeated in Albany, everybody's\r\ntalkin' about senators bein' bribed. Now, I wasn't in the Senate last\r\nsession, and I don't know the ins and outs of everything that was done,\r\nbut I can tell you that the legislators are often hauled over the coals\r\nwhen they are all on the level I've been there and I know. For instance,\r\nwhen I voted in the Senate in 1904, for the Remsen Bill that the\r\nnewspapers called the \"Astoria Gas Grab Bill,\" they didn't do a thing to\r\nme. The papers kept up a howl about all the supporters of the bill bein'\r\nbought up by the Consolidated Gas Company, and the Citizens' Union\r\ndid me the honor to call me the commander-in-chief of the \"Black Horse\r\nCavalry.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that I was workin' for my district all this time, and I\r\nwasn't bribed by nobody. There's several of these gashouses in the\r\ndistrict, and I wanted to get them over to Astoria for three reasons:\r\nfirst, because they're nuisances; second, because there's no votes in\r\nthem for me any longer; third, because--well, I had a little private\r\nreason which I'll explain further on. I needn't explain how they're\r\nnuisances. They're worse than open sewers. Still, I might have stood\r\nthat if they hadn't degenerated so much in the last few years.\r\n\r\nAh, gashouses ain't what they used to be! Not very long ago, each\r\ngashouse was good for a couple of hundred votes. All the men employed in\r\nthem were Irishmen and Germans who lived in the district. Now, it is\r\nall different. The men are dagoes who live across in Jersey and take\r\nno interest in the district. What's the use of havin' ill-smellin'\r\ngashouses if there's no votes in them?\r\n\r\nNow, as to my private reason. Well, I'm a business man and go in for\r\nany business that's profitable and honest. Real estate is one of my\r\nspecialties. I know the value of every foot of ground in my district,\r\nand I calculated long ago that if them gashouses was removed,\r\nsurroundin' property would go up 100 per cent. When the Remsen Bill,\r\nprovidin' for the removal of the gashouses to Queens County came up. I\r\nsaid to myself: \"George, hasn't your chance come?\" I answered: \"Sure.\"\r\nThen I sized up the chances of the bill. I found it was certain to\r\npass the Senate and the Assembly, and I got assurances straight from\r\nheadquarters that Governor Odell would sign it. Next I came down to the\r\ncity to find out the mayor's position. I got it straight that he would\r\napprove the bill, too.\r\n\r\nCan't you guess what I did then? Like any sane man who had my\r\ninformation, I went in and got options on a lot of the property around\r\nthe gashouses. Well, the bill went through the Senate and the Assembly\r\nall right and the mayor signed it, but Odell backslided at the last\r\nminute and the whole game fell through. If it had succeeded, I guess I\r\nwould have been accused of graftin'. What I want to know is, what do you\r\ncall it when I got left and lost a pot of money?\r\n\r\nI not only lost money, but I was abused for votin' for the bill. Wasn't\r\nthat outrageous? They said I was in with the Consolidated Gas Company\r\nand all other kinds of rot, when I was really only workin' for my\r\ndistrict and tryin' to turn an honest penny on the side. Anyhow I got\r\na little fun out of the business. When the Remsen Bill was up, I was\r\ntryin' to put through a bill of my own, the Spuyten Duyvil Bill, which\r\nprovided for fillin' in some land under water that the New York Central\r\nRailroad wanted. Well, the Remsen managers were afraid of bein'\r\nbeaten and they went around offerin' to make trades with senators and\r\nassemblymen who had bills they were anxious to pass. They came to me and\r\noffered six votes for my Spuyten Duyvil Bill in exchange for my vote on\r\nthe Remsen Bill. I took them up in a hurry, and they felt pretty sore\r\nafterwards when they heard I was goin' to vote for the Remsen Bill\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\nA word about that Spuyten Duyvil Bill--I was criticized a lot for\r\nintroducin' it. They said I was workin' in the interest of the New York\r\nCentral, and was goin' to get the contract for fillin' in. The fact is,\r\nthat the fillin' in was a good thing for the city, and if it helped\r\nthe New York Central, too, what of it? The railroad is a great public\r\ninstitution, and I was never an enemy of public institutions. As to the\r\ncontract, it hasn't come along yet. If it does come, it will find me at\r\nhome at all proper and reasonable hours, if there is a good profit in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThe papers and some people are always ready to find wrong motives\r\nin what us statesmen do. If we bring about some big improvement that\r\nbenefits the city and it just happens, as a sort of coincidence, that we\r\nmake a few dollars out of the improvement, they say we are grafters.\r\nBut we are used to this kind of ingratitude. It falls to the lot of all\r\nstatesmen, especially Tammany statesmen. All we can do is to bow our\r\nheads in silence and wait till time has cleared our memories.\r\n\r\nJust think of mentionin' dishonest graft in connection with the name of\r\nGeorge Washington Plunkitt, the man who gave the city its magnificent\r\nchain of parks, its Washington Bridge, its Speedway, its Museum of\r\nNatural History, its One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street Viaduct and its\r\nWest Side Courthouse! 1 was the father of the bills that provided for\r\nall these; yet, because I supported the Remsen and Spuyten Duyvil bills,\r\nsome people have questioned my honest motives. If that's the case, how\r\ncan you expect legislators to fare who are not the fathers of the parks,\r\nthe Washington Bridge, the Speedway and the Viaduct?\r\n\r\nNow, understand; I ain't defendin' the senators who killed the\r\neighty-cent gas bill. I don't know why they acted as they did; I only\r\nwant to impress the idea to go slow before you make up your mind that a\r\nman, occupyin' the exalted position that 1 held for so many years, has\r\ndone wrong. For all I know, these senators may have been as honest and\r\nhigh minded about the gas bill as I was about the Remsen and Spuyten\r\nDuyvil bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16. Plunkitt's Fondest Dream\r\n\r\nThe time is comm' and though I'm no youngster, I may see it, when New\r\nYork City will break away from the State and become a state itself. It's\r\ngot to come. The feelin' between this city and the hayseeds that make\r\na livin' by plunderin' it is every bit as bitter as the feelin' between\r\nthe North and South before the war. And, let me tell you, if there ain't\r\na peaceful separation before long, we may have the horrors of civil war\r\nright here in New York State. Why, I know a lot of men in my district\r\nwho would like nothin' better today than to go out gunnin' for hayseeds!\r\n\r\nNew York City has got a bigger population than most of the states in the\r\nUnion. It's got more wealth than any dozen of them. Yet the people here,\r\nas I explained before, are nothin' but slaves of the Albany gang. We\r\nhave stood the slavery a long, long time, but the uprisin' is near at\r\nhand. It will be a fight for liberty, just like the American Revolution.\r\nWe'll get liberty peacefully if we can; by cruel war if we must.\r\n\r\nJust think how lovely things would be here if we had a Tammany Governor\r\nand Legislature meetin', say in the neighborhood of Fifty-ninth Street,\r\nand a Tammany Mayor and Board of Aldermen doin' business in City Hall!\r\nHow sweet and peaceful everything would go on!\r\n\r\nThe people wouldn't have to bother about nothin'. Tammany would take\r\ncare of everything for them in its nice quiet way. You wouldn't hear of\r\nany conflicts between the state and city authorities. They would settle\r\neverything pleasant and comfortable at Tammany Hall, and every bill\r\nintroduced in the Legislature by Tammany would be sure to go through.\r\nThe Republicans wouldn't count.\r\n\r\nImagine how the city would be built up in a short time! At present we\r\ncan't make a public improvement of any consequence without goin' to\r\nAlbany for permission, and most of the time we get turned down when we\r\ngo there. But, with a Tammany Governor and Legislature up at Fifty-ninth\r\nStreet, how public works would hum here! The Mayor and Aldermen could\r\ndecide on an improvement, telephone the Capitol, have a bill put through\r\nin a jiffy and--there you are. We could have a state constitution, too,\r\nwhich would extend the debt limit so that we could issue a whole lot\r\nmore bonds. As things are now, all the money spent for docks, for\r\ninstance, is charged against the city in calculatin' the debt limit,\r\nalthough the Dock Department provides immense revenues. It's the same\r\nwith some other departments. This humbug would be dropped if Tammany\r\nruled at the Capitol and the City Hall, and the city would have money to\r\nburn.\r\n\r\nAnother thing--the constitution of the new state wouldn't have a word\r\nabout civil service, and if any man dared to introduce any kind of a\r\ncivil service bill in the Legislature, he would be fired out the window.\r\nThen we would have government of the people by the people who were\r\nelected to govern them. That's the kind of government Lincoln meant. 0\r\nwhat a glorious future for the city! Whenever I think of it I feel like\r\ngoin' out and celebratin', and I'm really almost sorry that I don't\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nYou may ask what would become of the upstate people if New York City\r\nleft them in the lurch and went into the State business on its own\r\naccount. Well, we wouldn't be under no obligation to provide for them;\r\nstill I would be in favor of helpin' them along for a while until they\r\ncould learn to work and earn an honest livin', just like the United\r\nStates Government looks after the Indians. These hayseeds have been so\r\nused to livin' off of New York City that they would be helpless after we\r\nleft them. It wouldn't do to let them starve. We might make some sort\r\nof an appropriation for them for a few years, but it would be with the\r\ndistinct understandin' that they must get busy right away and learn\r\nto support themselves. If, after say five years, they weren't\r\nself-supportin', we could withdraw the appropriation and let them shift\r\nfor themselves. The plan might succeed and it might not. We'd be doin'\r\nour duty anyhow.\r\n\r\nSome persons might say: \"But how about it if the hayseed politicians\r\nmoved down here and went in to get control of the government of the new\r\nstate?\" We could provide against that easy by passin' a law that these\r\npoliticians couldn't come below the Bronx without a sort of passport\r\nlimitin' the time of their stay here, and forbiddin' them to monkey with\r\npolitics here. I don't know just what kind of a bill would be required\r\nto fix this, but with a Tammany Constitution, Governor, Legislature and\r\nMayor, there would be no trouble in settlin' a little matter of that\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nSay, I don't wish I was a poet, for if I was, I guess I'd be livin' in\r\na garret on no dollars a week instead of runnin' a great contractin'\r\nand transportation business which is doin' pretty well, thank you;\r\nbut, honest, now, the notion takes me sometimes to yell poetry of the\r\nred-hot-hail-glorious-land kind when I think of New York City as a state\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17. Tammany's Patriotism\r\n\r\nTAMMANY's the most patriotic organization on earth, notwithstandin' the\r\nfact that the civil service law is sappin' the foundations of patriotism\r\nall over the country. Nobody pays any attention to the Fourth of July\r\nany longer except Tammany and the small boy. When the Fourth comes, the\r\nreformers, with Revolutionary names parted in the middle, run off\r\nto Newport or the Adirondacks to get out of the way of the noise and\r\neverything that reminds them of the glorious day. How different it is\r\nwith Tammany! The very constitution of the Tammany Society requires that\r\nwe must assemble at the wigwam on the Fourth, regardless of the weather,\r\nand listen to the readin' of the Declaration of Independence and\r\npatriotic speeches.\r\n\r\nYou ought to attend one of these meetin's. They're a liberal education\r\nin patriotism. The great hall upstairs is filled with five thousand\r\npeople, suffocatin' from heat and smoke. Every man Jack of these five\r\nthousand knows that down in the basement there's a hundred cases of\r\nchampagne and two hundred kegs of beer ready to flow when the signal is\r\ngiven. Yet that crowd stick to their seats without turnin' a hair\r\nwhile, for four solid hours, the Declaration of Independence is read,\r\nlong-winded orators speak, and the glee dub sings itself hoarse.\r\n\r\nTalk about heroism in the battlefield! That comes and passes away in a\r\nmoment. You ain't got time to be anything but heroic. But just think of\r\nfive thousand men sittin' in the hottest place on earth for four long\r\nhours, with parched lips and gnawin' stomachs, and knowin' all the\r\ntime that the delights of the oasis in the desert were only two flights\r\ndownstairs! Ah, that is the highest kind of patriotism, the patriotism\r\nof long sufferin' and endurance. What man wouldn't rather face a cannon\r\nfor a minute or two than thirst for four hours, with champagne and beer\r\nalmost under his nose?\r\n\r\nAnd then see how they applaud and yell when patriotic things are said!\r\nAs soon as the man on the platform starts off with \"when, in the\r\ncourse of human events,\" word goes around that it's the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and a mighty roar goes up. The Declaration ain't a very\r\nshort document and the crowd has heard it on every Fourth but they give\r\nit just as fine a send off as if it was brand-new and awful excitin'.\r\nThen the \"long talkers\" get in their work, that is two or three orators\r\nwho are good for an hour each. Heat never has any effect on these men.\r\nThey use every minute of their time. Sometimes human nature gets the\r\nbetter of a man in the audience and he begins to nod, but he always\r\nwakes up with a hurrah for the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe greatest hero of the occasion is the Grand Sachem of the Tammany\r\nSociety who presides. He and the rest of us Sachems come on the stage\r\nwearin' stovepipe hats, accordin' to the constitution, but we can shed\r\nours right off, while the Grand Sachem is required to wear his hat all\r\nthrough the celebration. Have you any idea what that means? Four hours\r\nunder a big silk hat in a hall where the heat registers 110 and the\r\nsmoke 250! And the Grand Sachem is expected to look pleasant all the\r\ntime and say nice things when introducin' the speakers! Often his hand\r\ngoes to his hat, unconscious-like, then he catches himself up in time\r\nand looks around like a man who is in the tenth story of a burnin'\r\nbuilding' seekin' a way to escape. I believe that Fourth-of-July silk\r\nhat shortened the life of one of our Grand Sachems, the late Supreme\r\nCourt Justice Smyth, and I know that one of our Sachems refused the\r\noffice of Grand Sachem because he couldn't get up sufficient patriotism\r\nto perform this four-hour hat act. You see, there's degrees of\r\npatriotism just as there's degrees in everything else.\r\n\r\nYou don't hear of the Citizens' Union people holdin' Fourth-of-July\r\ncelebrations under a five-pound silk hat, or any other way, do you? The\r\nCits take the Fourth like a dog I had when I was a boy. That dog knew\r\nas much as some Cits and he acted just like them about the glorious day.\r\nExactly forty-eight hours before each Fourth of July, the dog left our\r\nhouse on a run and hid himself in the Bronx woods. The day after the\r\nFourth he turned up at home as regular as clockwork. He must have known\r\nwhat a dog is up against on the Fourth. Anyhow, he kept out of the way.\r\nThe name-parted-in-the-middle aristocrats act in just the same way.\r\nThey don't want to be annoyed with firecrackers and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and when they see the Fourth comm' they hustle off to the\r\nwoods like my dog.\r\n\r\nTammany don't only show its patriotism at Fourth-of-July celebrations.\r\nIt's always on deck when the country needs its services. After the\r\nSpanish-American War broke Out, John J. Scannell, the Tammany leader of\r\nthe Twenty-fifth District, wrote to Governor Black offerin' to raise a\r\nTammany regiment to go to the front. If you want proof, go to Tammany\r\nHall and see the beautiful set of engrossed resolutions about this\r\nregiment. It's true that the Governor didn't accept the offer, but it\r\nshowed Tammany's patriotism. Some enemies of the organization have said\r\nthat the offer to raise the regiment was made after the Governor let\r\nit be known that no more volunteers were wanted, but that's the talk of\r\nenvious slanderers.\r\n\r\nNow, a word about Tammany's love for the American flag. Did you ever\r\nsee Tammany Hall decorated for a celebration? It's just a mass of flags.\r\nThey even take down the window shades and put flags in place of them.\r\nThere's flags everywhere except on the floors. We don't care for expense\r\nwhere the American flag is concerned, especially after we have won an\r\nelection. In 1904 we originated the custom of givin' a small flag to\r\neach man as he entered Tammany Hall for the Fourth-of-July celebration.\r\nIt took like wildfire. The men waved their flags whenever they cheered\r\nand the sight made me feel so patriotic that I forgot all about civil\r\nservice for a while. And the good work of the flags didn't stop there.\r\nThe men carried them home and gave them to the children, and the kids\r\ngot patriotic, too. Of course, it all cost a pretty penny, but what of\r\nthat? We had won at the polls the precedin' November, had the offices\r\nand could afford to make an extra investment in patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18. On the Use of Money in Politics\r\n\r\nTHE civil service gang is always howlin' about candidates and\r\nofficeholders puttin' up money for campaigns and about corporations\r\nchippin' in. They might as well howl about givin' contributions to\r\nchurches. A political organization has to have money for its business as\r\nwell as a church, and who has more right to put up than the men who get\r\nthe good things that are goin'? Take, for instance, a great political\r\nconcern like Tammany Hall It does missionary work like a church, it's\r\ngot big expenses and it's got to be supported by the faithful. If\r\na corporation sends in a check to help the good work of the Tammany\r\nSociety, why shouldn't we take it like other missionary societies? Of\r\ncourse, the day may come when we'll reject the money of the rich as\r\ntainted, but it hadn't come when I left Tammany Hall at 11:25 A.M.\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nNot long ago some newspapers had fits became the Assemblyman from my\r\ndistrict said he had put up $500 when he was nominated for the Assembly\r\nlast year. Every politician in town laughed at these papers. I don't\r\nthink there was even a Citizens' Union man who didn't know that\r\ncandidates of both parties have to chip in for campaign expenses. The\r\nsums they pay are accordin' to their salaries and the length of their\r\nterms of office, if elected. Even candidates for the Supreme Court have\r\nto fall in line. A Supreme Court Judge in New York County gets $17,500\r\na year, and he's expected, when nominated, to help along the good cause\r\nwith a year's salary. Why not? He has fourteen years on the bench ahead\r\nof him, and ten thousand other lawyers would be willin' to put up\r\ntwice as much to be in his shoes. Now, I ain't sayin' that we sell\r\nnominations. That's a different thing altogether. There's no auction\r\nand no regular biddin'. The man is picked out and somehow he gets to\r\nunderstand what's expected of him in the way of a contribution, and he\r\nponies up--all from gratitude to the organization that honored him, see?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you an instance that shows the difference between sellin'\r\nnominations and arrangin' them in the way I described. A few years ago a\r\nRepublican district leader controlled the nomination for Congress in his\r\nCongressional district. Four men wanted it. At first the leader asked\r\nfor bids privately, but decided at last that the best thing to do was to\r\nget the four men together in the back room of a certain saloon and have\r\nan open auction. When he had his men lined up, he got on a chair, told\r\nabout the value of the goods for sale, and asked for bids in regular\r\nauctioneer style. The highest bidder got the nomination for $5000. Now,\r\nthat wasn't right at all. These things ought to be always fixed up nice\r\nand quiet.\r\n\r\nAs to officeholders, they would be ingrates if they didn't contribute to\r\nthe organization that put them in office. They needn't be assessed. That\r\nwould be against the law. But they know what's expected of them, and\r\nif they happen to forget they can be reminded polite and courteous.\r\nDan Donegan, who used to be the Wiskinkie of the Tammany Society, and\r\nreceived contributions from grateful officeholders, had a pleasant way\r\nof remindin'. If a man forgot his duty to the organization that made\r\nhim, Dan would call on the man, smile as sweet as you please and say:\r\n\"You haven't been round at the Hall lately, have you?\" If the man tried\r\nto slide around the question, Dan would say: \"It's gettin' awful cold.\"\r\nThen he would have a fit of shiverin' and walk away. What could be\r\nmore polite and, at the same time, more to the point? No force, no\r\nthreats--only a little shiverin' which any man is liable to even in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nJust here, I want to charge one more crime to the infamous civil service\r\nlaw. It has made men turn ungrateful. A dozen years ago, when there\r\nwasn't much civil service business in the city government, and when\r\nthe administration could turn out almost any man holdin' office, Dan's\r\nshiver took effect every time and there was no ingratitude in the city\r\ndepartments. But when the civil service law came in and all the clerks\r\ngot lead-pipe cinches on their jobs, ingratitude spread right away.\r\nDan shivered and shook till his bones rattled, but many of the city\r\nemployees only laughed at him. One day, I remember, he tackled a clerk\r\nin the Public Works Department, who used to give up pretty regular, and,\r\nafter the usual question, began to shiver. The clerk smiled. Dan shook\r\ntill his hat fell off. The clerk took ten cents out of his pocket,\r\nhanded it to Dan and said: \"Poor man! Go and get a drink to warm\r\nyourself up.\" Wasn't that shameful? And yet, if it hadn't been for the\r\ncivil service law, that clerk would be contributin' right along to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe civil service law don't cover everything, however. There's lots of\r\ngood jobs outside its clutch, and the men that get them are grateful\r\nevery time. I'm not speakin' of Tammany Hall alone, remember! It's the\r\nsame with the Republican Federal and State officeholders, and every\r\norganization that has or has had jobs to give out--except, of course,\r\nthe Citizens' Union. The Cits held office only a couple of years and,\r\nknowin' that they would never be in again, each Cit officeholder held on\r\nfor dear life to every dollar that came his way.\r\n\r\nSome people say they can't understand what becomes of all the money\r\nthat's collected for campaigns. They would understand fast enough if\r\nthey were district lead-em. There's never been half enough money to go\r\naround. Besides the expenses for meetin's, bands and all that, there's\r\nthe bigger bill for the district workers who get men to the polls. These\r\nworkers are mostly men who want to serve their country but can't get\r\njobs in the city departments on account of the civil service law. They\r\ndo the next best thing by keepin' track of the voters and seem' that\r\nthey come to the polls and vote the right way. Some of these deservin'\r\ncitizens have to make enough on registration and election days to keep\r\nthem the rest of the year. Isn't it right that they should get a share\r\nof the campaign money?\r\n\r\nJust remember that there's thirty-five Assembly districts in New York\r\nCounty, and thirty-six district leaders reachin' out for the Tammany\r\ndough-bag for somethin' to keep up the patriotism of ten thousand\r\nworkers, and you wouldn't wonder that the cry for more, more, is goin'\r\nup from every district organization now and forevermore. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19. The Successful Politician Does Not Drink\r\n\r\nI HAVE explained how to succeed in politics. I want to add that no\r\nmatter how well you learn to play the political game, you won't make a\r\nlastin' success of it if you're a drinkin' man. I never take a drop\r\nof any kind of intoxicatin' liquor. I ain't no fanatic. Some of the\r\nsaloonkeepers are my best friends, and I don't mind goin' into a saloon\r\nany day with my friends. But as a matter of business I leave whisky and\r\nbeer and the rest of that stuff alone. As a matter of business, too, I\r\ntake for my lieutenants in my district men who don't drink. I tried the\r\nother kind for several years, but it didn't pay. They cost too much. For\r\ninstance, I had a young man who was one of the best hustlers in town. He\r\nknew every man in the district, was popular everywhere and could induce\r\na half-dead man to come to the polls on election day. But, regularly,\r\ntwo weeks before election, he started on a drunk, and I had to hire two\r\nmen to guard him day and night and keep him sober enough to do his work.\r\nThat cost a lot of money, and I dropped the young man after a while.\r\n\r\nMaybe you think I'm unpopular with the saloonkeepers because 1 don't\r\ndrink. You're wrong. The most successful saloonkeepers don't drink\r\nthemselves and they understand that my temperance is a business\r\nproposition, just like their own. I have a saloon under my headquarters.\r\nIf a saloonkeeper gets into trouble he always knows that Senator\r\nPlunkitt is the man to help him out. If there is a bill in the\r\nLegislature makin' it easier for the liquor dealers, I am for it every\r\ntime. I'm one of the best friends the saloon men have--but I don't drink\r\ntheir whisky. I won't go through the temperance lecture dodge and tell\r\nyou how many' bright young men I've seen fall victims to intemperance,\r\nbut I'll tell you that I could name dozens--young men who had started on\r\nthe road to statesmanship who could carry their districts every time,\r\nand who could turn out any vote you wanted at the primaries. I honestly\r\nbelieve that drink is the greatest curse of the day, except, of course.\r\ncivil service, and that it has driven more young men to ruin than\r\nanything except civil service examinations.\r\n\r\nLook at the great leaders of Tammany Hall! No regular drinkers among\r\nthem. Richard Croker's strongest drink was vichy. Charlie Murphy takes\r\na glass of wine at dinner sometimes, but he don't go beyond that A\r\ndrinkin' man wouldn't last two weeks as leader of Tammany Hall. Nor can\r\na man manage an assembly district long if he drinks. He's got to have\r\na clear head all the time. I could name ten men who, in the last few\r\nyears lost their grip in their districts because they began drinkin'.\r\nThere's now thirty-six district leaders in Tammany Hall, and I don't\r\nbelieve a half-dozen of them ever drink anything except at meals. People\r\nhave got an idea that because the liquor men are with us in campaigns.\r\nour district leaders spend most of their time leanin' against bars.\r\nThere couldn't be a wronger idea. The district leader makes a business\r\nof politics, gets his livin' out of it, and, in order to succeed, he's\r\ngot to keep sober just like in any other business.\r\n\r\nJust take as examples \"Big Tim\" and \"Little Tim\" Sullivan. They're known\r\nall over the country as the Bowery leaders and, as there's nothin' but\r\nsaloons on the Bowery, people might think that they are hard drinkers.\r\nThe fact is that neither of them has ever touched a drop of liquor in\r\nhis life of even smoked a cigar. Still they don't make no pretenses\r\nof being better than anybody else, and don't go around deliverin'\r\ntemperance lectures. Big Tim made money out of liquor--sellin' it to\r\nother people. That's the only way to get good out of liquor.\r\n\r\nLook at all the Tammany heads of city departments? There's not a real\r\ndrinkin' man in the lot. Oh, yes, there are some prominent men in the\r\norganization who drink sometimes, but they are not the men who have\r\npower. They're ornaments, fancy speakers and all that, who make a fine\r\nshow behind the footlights, but am I in it when it comes to directin'\r\nthe city government and the Tammany organization. The men who sit in the\r\nexecutive committee room at Tammany Hall and direct things are men\r\nwho celebrate on apollinaris or vichy. Let me tell you what I saw on\r\nelection night in 1897, when the Tammany ticket swept the city: Up to 10\r\nP.M. Croker, John F. Carroll, Tim Sullivan, Charlie Murphy, and myself\r\nsat in the committee room receivin' returns. When nearly all the city\r\nwas heard from and we saw that Van Wyck was elected by a big majority,\r\nI invited the crowd to go across the street for a little celebration.\r\nA lot of small politicians followed us, expectin' to see magnums of\r\nchampagne opened. The waiters in the restaurant expected it, too, and\r\nyou never saw a more disgusted lot of waiters when they got our orders.\r\nHere's the orders: Croker, vichy and bicarbonate of soda; Carroll,\r\nseltzer lemonade; Sullivan, apollinaris; Murphy, vichy; Plunkitt, ditto.\r\nBefore midnight we were all in bed, and next mornin' we were up bright\r\nand early attendin' to business, while other men were nursin' swelled\r\nheads. Is there anything the matter with temperance as a pure business\r\nproposition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20. Bosses Preserve the Nation\r\n\r\nWHEN I retired from the Senate, I thought I would take a good, long\r\nrest, such a rest as a man needs who has held office for about forty\r\nyears, and has held four different offices in one year and drawn\r\nsalaries from three of them at the same time. Drawin' so many salaries\r\nis rather fatiguin', you know, and, as I said, I started out for a rest;\r\nbut when I seen how things were goin' in New York State, and how a\r\ngreat big black shadow hung over us, I said to myself: \"No rest for\r\nyou, George. Your work ain't done. Your country still needs you and you\r\nmustn't lay down yet.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the great big black shadow? It was the primary election law,\r\namended so as to knock out what are called the party bosses by lettin'\r\nin everybody at the primaries and givin' control over them to state\r\nofficials. Oh, yes, that is a good way to do up the so-called bosses,\r\nbut have you ever thought what would become of the country if the\r\nbosses were put out of business, and their places were taken by a lot of\r\ncart-tail orators and college graduates? It would mean chaos. It would\r\nbe just like takin' a lot of dry-goods clerks and settin' them to run\r\nexpress trains on the New York Central Railroad. It makes my heart bleed\r\nto think of it. Ignorant people are always talkin' against party bosses,\r\nbut just wait till the bosses are gone! Then, and not until then, will\r\nthey get the right sort of epitaphs, as Patrick Henry or Robert Emmet\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLook at the bosses of Tammany Hall in the last twenty years. What\r\nmagnificent men! To them New York City owes pretty much all it is\r\ntoday. John Kelly, Richard Croker, and Charles F. Murphy--what names in\r\nAmerican history compares with them, except Washington and Lincoln? They\r\nbuilt up the grand Tammany organization, and the organization built up\r\nNew York. Suppose the city had to depend for the last twenty years on\r\nirresponsible concerns like the Citizens' Union, where would it be\r\nnow? You can make a pretty good guess if you recall the Strong and Low\r\nadministrations when there was no boss, and the heads of departments\r\nwere at odds all the time with each other, and the Mayor was at odds\r\nwith the lot of them. They spent so much time in arguin' and makin'\r\ngrandstand play, that the interests of the city were forgotten. Another\r\nadministration of that kind would put New York back a quarter of a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThen see how beautiful a Tammany city government runs, with a so-called\r\nboss directin' the whole shootin' match! The machinery moves so\r\nnoiseless that you wouldn't think there was any. If there's any\r\ndifferences of opinion the Tammany leader settles them quietly and his\r\norders go every time. How nice it is for the people to feel that they\r\ncan get up in the mornin' without hem' afraid of seem' in the\r\npapers that the Commissioner of Water Supply has sandbagged the Dock\r\nCommissioner, and that the Mayor and heads of the departments have been\r\ntaken to the police court as witnesses! That's no joke. I remember that,\r\nunder Strong, some commissioners came very near sandbaggin' one another.\r\n\r\nOf course, the newspapers like the reform administration. Why? Because\r\nthese administrations, with their daily rows, furnish as racy news as\r\nprizefights or divorce cases. Tammany don't care to get in the papers.\r\nIt goes right along attendin' to business quietly and only wants to be\r\nlet alone. That's one reason why the papers are against us.\r\n\r\nSome papers complain that the bosses get rich while devotin' their lives\r\nto the interests of the city. What of it? If opportunities for turnin'\r\nan honest dollar comes their 'way, why shouldn't they take advantage of\r\nthem, just as I have done? As I said, in another talk, there is honest\r\ngraft and dishonest graft. The bosses go in for the former. There is\r\nso much of it in this big town that they would be fools to go in for\r\ndishonest graft.\r\n\r\nNow, the primary election law threatens to do away with the boss and\r\nmake the city government a menagerie. That's why I can't take the rest\r\nI counted on. I'm goin' to propose a bill for the next session of the\r\nlegislature repealin' this dangerous law, and leavin' the primaries\r\nentirely to the organizations themselves, as they used to be. Then will\r\nreturn the good old times, when our district leaders could have nice\r\ncomfortable primary elections at some place selected by themselves and\r\nlet in only men that they approved of as good Democrats. Who is a better\r\njudge of the Democracy of a man who offers his vote than the leader of\r\nthe district? Who is better equipped to keep out undesirable voters?\r\n\r\nThe men who put through the primary law are the same crowd that stand\r\nfor the civil service blight and they have the same objects in view--the\r\ndestruction of governments by party, the downfall of the constitution\r\nand hell generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 21. Concerning Excise\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH I'm not a drinkin' man myself, I mourn with the poor liquor\r\ndealers of New York City, who are taxed and oppressed for the benefit\r\nof the farmers up the state. The Raines liquor law is infamous It takes\r\naway nearly all the profits of the saloonkeepers, and then turns in a\r\nlarge part of the money to the State treasury to relieve the hayseeds\r\nfrom taxes. Ah, who knows how many honest, hard-workin' saloonkeepers\r\nhave been driven to untimely graves by this law! I know personally of a\r\nhalf-dozen who committed suicide--because they couldn't pay the enormous\r\nlicense fee, and I have heard of many others. Every time there is an\r\nincrease of the fee, there is an increase in the suicide record of the\r\ncity. Now, some of these Republican hayseeds are talkin' about makin'\r\nthe liquor tax $1500, or even $2000 a year. That would mean the suicide\r\nof half of the liquor dealers in the city.\r\n\r\nJust see how these poor fellows are oppressed all around! First,\r\nliquor is taxed in the hands of the manufacturer by the United States\r\nGovernment; second, the wholesale dealer pays a special tax to the\r\ngovernment; third, the retail dealer is specially taxed by the United\r\nStates Government; fourth, the retail dealer has to pay a big tax to the\r\nState government.\r\n\r\nNow, liquor dealing is criminal or it ain't. If it's criminal, the men\r\nengaged in it ought to be sent to prison. If it ain't criminal, they\r\nought to be protected and encouraged to make all the profit they\r\nhonestly can. If it's right to tax a saloonkeeper $1000, it's right\r\nto put a heavy tax on dealers in other beverages--in milk, for\r\ninstance--and make the dairymen pay up. But what a howl would be raised\r\nif a bill was introduced in Albany to compel the farmers to help support\r\nthe State government! What would be said of a law that put a tax of, say\r\n$60 on a grocer, $150 on a dry-goods man, and $500 more if he includes\r\nthe other goods that are kept in a country store?\r\n\r\nIf the Raines law gave the money extorted from the saloonkeepers to the\r\ncity, there might be some excuse for the tax. We would get some benefit\r\nfrom it, but it gives a big part of the tax to local option localities\r\nwhere the people are always shoutin' that liquor dealin' is immoral.\r\nOught these good people be subjected to the immoral influence of money\r\ntaken from the saloon tainted money? Out of respect for the tender\r\nconsciences of these pious people, the Raines law ought to exempt them\r\nfrom all contamination from the plunder that comes from the saloon\r\ntraffic. Say, mark that sarcastic. Some people who ain't used to fine\r\nsarcasm might think I meant it.\r\n\r\nThe Raines people make a pretense that the high license fee promotes\r\ntemperance. It's just the other way around. It makes more intemperance\r\nand, what is as bad, it makes a monopoly in dram shops. Soon the saloons\r\nwill be in the hands of a vast trust' and any stuff can be sold for\r\nwhisky or beer. It's gettin' that way already. Some of the poor liquor\r\ndealers in my district have been forced to sell wood alcohol for whisky,\r\nand many deaths have followed. A half-dozen men died in a couple of days\r\nfrom this kind of whisky which was forced down their throats by the\r\nhigh liquor tax. If they raise the tax higher, wood alcohol will be too\r\ncostly, and I guess some dealers will have to get down to kerosene oil\r\nand add to the Rockefeller millions.\r\n\r\nThe way the Raines law divides the different classes of licenses is\r\nalso an outrage. The sumptuous hotel saloons, with $10,000 paintin's and\r\nbricky-brac and Oriental splendors gets off easier than a shanty on\r\nthe rocks, by the water's edge in my district where boatmen drink their\r\ngrog, and the only ornaments is a three-cornered mirror nailed to the\r\nwall, and a chromo of the fight between Tom Hyer and Yankee Sullivan.\r\nBesides, a premium is put on places that sell liquor not to be drunk on\r\nthe premises, but to be taken home. Now, I want to declare that from\r\nmy experience in New York City, I would rather see rum sold in the\r\ndram-shops unlicenced, provided the rum is swallowed on the spot, than\r\nto encourage, by a low tax, \"bucket-shops\" from which the stuff is\r\ncarried into the tenements at all hours of the day and night and make\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery among the women and children. A \"bucket-shop\"\r\nin the tenement district means a cheap, so-called distillery, where raw\r\nspirits, poisonous colorin' matter and water are sold for brandy and\r\nwhisky at ten cents a quart, and carried away in buckets and pitchers;\r\nI have always noticed that there are many undertakers wherever the\r\n\"bucket-shop\" flourishes, and they have no dull seasons.\r\n\r\nI want it understood that I'm not an advocate of the liquor dealers or\r\nof drinkin'. I think every man would be better off if he didn't take\r\nany intoxicatin' drink at all, but as men will drink, they ought to have\r\ngood stuff without impoverishin' themselves by goin' to fancy places\r\nand without riskin' death by goin' to poor places. The State should\r\nlook after their interests as well as the interests of those who drink\r\nnothin' stronger than milk. Now, as to the liquor dealers themselves.\r\nThey ain't the criminals that cantin' hypocrites say they are. I know\r\nlots of them and I know that, as a rule, they're good honest citizens\r\nwho conduct their business in a straight, honorable way. At a convention\r\nof the liquor dealers a few years ago, a big city official welcomed them\r\non behalf of the city and said: \"Go on elevatin' your standard higher\r\nand higher. Go on with your good work. Heaven will bless YOU!\" That was\r\nputtin' it just a little strong, but the sentiment was all right and I\r\nguess the speaker went a bit further than he intended in his enthusiasm\r\nover meetin' such a fine set of men and, perhaps, dinin' with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 22. A Parting Word on the Future of the Democratic Party in\r\nAmerica\r\n\r\nTHE Democratic party of the nation ain't dead, though it's been givin'\r\na lifelike imitation of a corpse for several years. It can't die while\r\nit's got Tammany for its backbone. The trouble is that the party's been\r\nchasm' after theories and stayin' up nights readin' books instead of\r\nstudyin' human nature and actin' accordin', as I've advised in tellin'\r\nhow to hold your district. In two Presidential campaigns, the leaders\r\ntalked themselves red in the face about silver bein' the best money and\r\ngold hem' no good, and they tried to prove it out of books. Do you think\r\nthe people cared for all that guff? No. They heartily indorsed what\r\nRichard Croker said at die Hoffman House one day in 1900. \"What's the\r\nuse of discussin' what's the best kind of money?\" said Croker. \"I'm\r\nin favor of all kinds of money--the more the better.\" See how a real\r\nTammany statesman can settle in twenty-five words a problem that\r\nmonopolized two campaigns!\r\n\r\nThen imperialism. The Democratic party spent all its breath on that in\r\nthe last national campaign. Its position was all right, sure, but you\r\ncan't get people excited about the Philippines. They've got too much at\r\nhome to interest them; they're too busy makin' a livin' to bother\r\nabout the niggers in the Pacific. The party's got to drop all them\r\nput-you-to-sleep issues and come out in 1908 for somethin' that will\r\nwake the people up; somethin' that will make it worth while to work for\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nThere's just one issue that would set this country on fire. The\r\nDemocratic party should say in the first plank of its platform: \"We\r\nhereby declare, in national convention assembled, that the paramount\r\nissue now, always and forever, is the abolition of the iniquitous and\r\nvillainous civil service laws which are destroyin' all patriotism, ruin\r\nin' the country and takin' away good jobs from them that earn them. We\r\npledge ourselves, if our ticket is elected, to repeal those laws at once\r\nand put every civil service reformer in jail.\"\r\n\r\nJust imagine the wild enthusiasm of the party, if that plank was\r\nadapted, and the rush of Republicans to join us in restorin' our country\r\nto what it was before this college professor's nightmare, called civil\r\nservice reform, got hold of it! Of course, it would be all right to\r\nwork in the platform some stuff about the tariff and sound money and the\r\nPhilippines, as no platform seems to be complete without them, but they\r\nwouldn't count. The people would read only the first plank and then\r\nhanker for election day to come to put the Democratic party in office.\r\n\r\nI see a vision. I see the civil service monster lyin' flat on the\r\nground. I see the Democratic party standin' over it with foot on its\r\nneck and wearin' the crown of victory. I see Thomas Jefferson lookin'\r\nout from a cloud and sayin': \"Give him another sockdologer; finish\r\nhim\"' And I see millions of men wavin' their hats and singin' \"Glory\r\nHallelujah!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 23. Strenuous Life of the Tammany District Leader\r\n\r\nNote: This chapter is based on extracts from Plunkitt's Diary and on my\r\ndaily observation of the work of the district leader.--W.L.R.\r\n\r\nTHE life of the Tammany district leader is strenuous. To his work is due\r\nthe wonderful recuperative power of the organization.\r\n\r\nOne year it goes down in defeat and the prediction is made that it will\r\nnever again raise its head. The district leader, undaunted by defeat,\r\ncollects his scattered forces, organizes them as only Tammany knows\r\nhow to organize, and in a little while the organization is as strong as\r\never.\r\n\r\nNo other politician in New York or elsewhere is exactly like the Tammany\r\ndistrict leader or works as he does. As a rule, he has no business or\r\noccupation other than politics. He plays politics every day and night in\r\nthe year, and his headquarters bears the inscription, \"Never closed.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody in the district knows him. Everybody knows where to find him,\r\nand nearly everybody goes to him for assistance of one sort or another,\r\nespecially the poor of the tenements.\r\n\r\nHe is always obliging. He will go to the police courts to put in a good\r\nword for the \"drunks and disorderlies\" or pay their fines, if a good\r\nword is not effective. He will attend christenings, weddings, and\r\nfunerals. He will feed the hungry and help bury the dead.\r\n\r\nA philanthropist? Not at all He is playing politics all the time.\r\n\r\nBrought up in Tammany Hall, he has learned how to reach the hearts of\r\nthe great mass of voters. He does not bother about reaching their heads.\r\nIt is his belief that arguments and campaign literature have never\r\ngained votes.\r\n\r\nHe seeks direct contact with the people, does them good turns when he\r\ncan, and relies on their not forgetting him on election day. His heart\r\nis always in his work, too, for his subsistence depends on its results.\r\n\r\nIf he holds his district and Tammany is in power, he is amply rewarded\r\nby a good office and the opportunities that go with it. What these\r\nopportunities are has been shown by the quick rise to wealth of so\r\nmany Tammany district leaders. With the examples before him of Richard\r\nCroker, once leader of the Twentieth District; John F. Carroll, formerly\r\nleader of the Twenty-ninth; Timothy (\"Dry Dollar\") Sullivan, late leader\r\nof the Sixth, and many others, he can always look forward to riches and\r\nease while he is going through the drudgery of his daily routine.\r\n\r\nThis is a record of a day's work by Plunkitt:\r\n\r\n2 A.M.: Aroused from sleep by the ringing Of his doorbell; went to the\r\ndoor and found a bartender, who asked him to go to the police station\r\nand ball out a saloon-keeper who had been arrested for violating the\r\nexcise law. Furnished bail and returned to bed at three o'clock.\r\n\r\n6.A.M.: Awakened by fire engines passing his house. Hastened to the\r\nscene of the fire, according to the custom of the Tammany district\r\nleaders, to give assistance to the fire sufferers, if needed. Met\r\nseveral of his election district captains who are always under orders\r\nto look out for fires, which are considered great vote-getters. Found\r\nseveral tenants who had been burned out, took them to a hotel, supplied\r\nthem with clothes, fed them, and arranged temporary quarters for them\r\nuntil they could rent and furnish new apartments.\r\n\r\n8:30 A.M.: Went to the police court to look after his constituents.\r\nFound six \"drunks.\" Secured the discharge of four by a timely word with\r\nthe judge, and paid the fines of two.\r\n\r\n9 A.M.: Appeared in the Municipal District Court. Directed one of his\r\ndistrict captains to act as counsel for a widow against whom dispossess\r\nproceedings had been instituted and obtained an extension of time.\r\nPaid the rent of a poor family about to be dispossessed and gave them a\r\ndollar for food.\r\n\r\n11 A.M.: At home again. Found four men waiting for him. One had been\r\ndischarged by the Metropolitan Rail way Company for neglect of duty, and\r\nwanted the district leader to fix things. Another wanted a job on the\r\nroad. The third sought a place on the Subway and the fourth, a plumber,\r\nwas looking for work with the Consolidated Gas Company. The district\r\nleader spent nearly three hours fixing things for the four men, and\r\nsucceeded in each case.\r\n\r\n3 P.M.: Attended the funeral of an Italian as far as the ferry. Hurried\r\nback to make his appearance at the funeral of a Hebrew constituent.\r\nWent conspicuously to the front both in the Catholic church and the\r\nsynagogue, and later attended the Hebrew confirmation ceremonies in the\r\nsynagogue.\r\n\r\n7 P.M.: Went to district headquarters and presided over a meeting of\r\nelection district captains. Each captain submitted a list of all the\r\nvoters in his district, reported on their attitude toward Tammany,\r\nsuggested who might be won over and how they could be won, told who were\r\nin need, and who were in trouble of any kind and the best way to reach\r\nthem. District leader took notes and gave orders.\r\n\r\n8 P.M.: Went to a church fair. Took chances on everything, bought ice\r\ncream for the young girls and the children. Kissed the little ones,\r\nflattered their mother: and took their fathers out for something down at\r\nthe comer.\r\n\r\n9 P.M.: At the clubhouse again. Spent $10 on tickets for a church\r\nexcursion and promised a subscription for a new church bell. Bought\r\ntickets for a baseball game to be played by two nines from his district.\r\nListened to the complaints of a dozen pushcart peddlers who said they\r\nwere persecuted by the police and assured them he would go to Police\r\nHeadquarter: in the morning and see about it.\r\n\r\n10:30 P.M.: Attended a Hebrew wedding reception and dance. Had\r\npreviously sent a handsome wedding present to the bride.\r\n\r\n12 P.M.: In bed.\r\n\r\nThat is the actual record of one day in the life Of Plunkitt. He does\r\nsome of the same things every day, but his life is not so monotonous as\r\nto be wearisome. Sometimes the work of a district leader is exciting,\r\nespecially if he happens to have a rival who intends to make a contest\r\nfor the leadership at the primaries. In that case, he is even more\r\nalert, tries to reach the fires before his rival, sends out runners to\r\nlook for \"drunks and disorderlies\" at the police stations, and keeps a\r\nvery dose watch on the obituary columns of the newspapers. A few years\r\nago there was a bitter contest for the Tammany leadership of the Ninth\r\nDistrict between John C. Sheehan and Frank J. Goodwin. Both had had long\r\nexperience in Tammany politics and both understood every move of the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nEvery morning their agents went to their respective headquarters before\r\nseven o'clock and read through the death notices in all the morning\r\npapers. If they found that anybody in the district had died, they rushed\r\nto the homes of their principals with the information and then there was\r\na race to the house of the deceased to offer condolences, and, if the\r\nfamily were poor, something more substantial.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the funeral there was another contest. Each faction tried\r\nto surpass the other in the number and appearance of the carriages it\r\nsent to the funeral, and more than once they almost came to blows at the\r\nchurch or in the cemetery.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the Goodwinites played a trick on their adversaries\r\nwhich has since been imitated in other districts. A well-known liquor\r\ndealer who had a considerable following died, and both Sheehan and\r\nGoodwin were eager to become his political heir by making a big showing\r\nat the funeral.\r\n\r\nGoodwin managed to catch the enemy napping. He went to all the livery\r\nstables in the district, hired all the carriages for the day, and gave\r\norders to two hundred of his men to be on hand as mourners.\r\n\r\nSheehan had never had any trouble about getting all the carriages that\r\nhe wanted, so he let the matter go until the night before the funeral.\r\nThen he found that he could not hire a carriage in the district.\r\n\r\nHe called his district committee together in a hurry and explained\r\nthe situation to them. He could get all the vehicles he needed in the\r\nadjoining district, he said, but if he did that, Goodwin would rouse\r\nthe voters of the Ninth by declaring that he (Sheehan) had patronized\r\nforeign industries.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was decided that there was nothing to do but to go over to\r\nSixth Avenue and Broadway for carriages. Sheehan made a fine turnout\r\nat the funeral, but the deceased was hardly in his grave before Goodwin\r\nraised the cry of \"Protection to home industries,\" and denounced his\r\nrival for patronizing livery-stable keepers outside of his district. The\r\nerr' had its effect in the primary campaign. At all events, Goodwin was\r\nelected leader.\r\n\r\nA recent contest for the leadership of the Second District illustrated\r\nfurther the strenuous work of the Tammany district leaders. The\r\ncontestants were Patrick Divver, who had managed the district for years,\r\nand Thomas F. Foley.\r\n\r\nBoth were particularly anxious to secure the large Italian vote. They\r\nnot only attended all the Italian christenings and funerals, but also\r\nkept a close lookout for the marriages in order to be on hand with\r\nwedding presents.\r\n\r\nAt first, each had his own reporter in the Italian quarter to keep track\r\nof the marriages. Later, Foley conceived a better plan. He hired a man\r\nto stay all day at the City Hall marriage bureau, where most Italian\r\ncouples go through the civil ceremony, and telephone to him at his\r\nsaloon when anything was doing at the bureau.\r\n\r\nFoley had a number of presents ready for use and, whenever he received a\r\ntelephone message from his man, he hastened to the City Hall with a\r\nring or a watch or a piece of silver and handed it to the bride with his\r\ncongratulations. As a consequence, when Divver got the news and went to\r\nthe home of the couple with his present, he always found that Foley had\r\nbeen ahead of him. Toward the end of the campaign, Divver also stationed\r\na man at the marriage bureau and then there were daily foot races and\r\nfights between the two heelers.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rivals came into conflict at the death-bed. One night a\r\npoor Italian peddler died in Roosevelt Street. The news reached Divver\r\nand Foley about the same time, and as they knew the family of the\r\nman was destitute, each went to an undertaker and brought him to the\r\nRoosevelt Street tenement.\r\n\r\nThe rivals and the undertakers met at the house and an altercation\r\nensued. After much discussion the Divver undertaker was selected. Foley\r\nhad more carriages at the funeral, however, and he further impressed the\r\nItalian voters by paying the widow's rent for a month, and sending her\r\nhalf a ton of coal and a barrel of flour.\r\n\r\nThe rivals were put on their mettle toward the end of the campaign by\r\nthe wedding of a daughter of one of the original Cohens of the Baxter\r\nStreet region. The Hebrew vote in the district is nearly as large as\r\nthe Italian vote, and Divver and Foley set out to capture the Cohens and\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nThey stayed up nights thinking what they would give the bride. Neither\r\nknew how much the other was prepared to spend on a wedding present, or\r\nwhat form it would take; so spies were employed by both sides to keep\r\nwatch on the jewelry stores, and the jewelers of the district were\r\nbribed by each side to impart the desired information.\r\n\r\nAt last Foley heard that Divver had purchased a set of silver knives,\r\nforks and spoons. He at once bought a duplicate set and added a silver\r\ntea service. When the presents were displayed at the home of the bride,\r\nDivver was not in a pleasant mood and he charged his jeweler with\r\ntreachery. It may be added that Foley won at the primaries.\r\n\r\nOne of the fixed duties of a Tammany district leader is to give two\r\noutings every summer, one for the men of his district and the other for\r\nthe women and children, and a beefsteak dinner and a ball every winter.\r\nThe scene of the outings is, usually, one of the groves along the Sound.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the district leader on these occasions is to demonstrate\r\nthat his men have broken all records in the matter of eating and\r\ndrinking. He gives out the exact number of pounds of beef, poultry,\r\nbutter, etc., that they have consumed and professes to know how many\r\npotatoes and ears of corn have been served.\r\n\r\nAccording to his figures, the average eating record of each man at the\r\nouting is about ten pounds of beef, two or three chickens, a pound\r\nof butter, a half peck of potatoes, and two dozen ears of corn. The\r\ndrinking records, as given out, are still more phenomenal. For\r\nsome reason, not yet explained, the district leader thinks that his\r\npopularity will be greatly increased if he can show that his followers\r\ncan eat and drink more than the followers of any other district leader.\r\n\r\nThe same idea governs the beefsteak dinners in the winter. It matters\r\nnot what sort of steak is served or how it is cooked; the district\r\nleader considers only the question of quantity, and when he excels all\r\nothers in this particular, he feels, somehow, that he is a bigger man\r\nand deserves more patronage than his associates in the Tammany Executive\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nAs to the balls, they are the events of the winter in the extreme East\r\nSide and West Side society. Mamie and Maggie and Jennie prepare for them\r\nmonths in advance, and their young men save up for the occasion just as\r\nthey save for the summer trips to Coney Island.\r\n\r\nThe district leader is in his glory at the opening of the ball He leads\r\nthe cotillion with the prettiest woman present--his wife, if he has one,\r\npermitting--and spends almost the whole night shaking hands with his\r\nconstituents. The ball costs him a pretty penny, but he has found that\r\nthe investment pays.\r\n\r\nBy these means the Tammany district leader reaches out into the homes of\r\nhis district, keeps watch not only on the men, but also on the women and\r\nchildren; knows their needs, their likes and dislikes, their troubles\r\nand their hopes, and places himself in a position to use his knowledge\r\nfor the benefit of his organization and himself. Is it any wonder\r\nthat scandals do not permanently disable Tammany and that it speedily\r\nrecovers from what seems to be crushing defeat?",
