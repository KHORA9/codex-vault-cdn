(of II)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\nSAUNDERS AND OTLEY, ANN STREET,\r\nAND CONDUIT STREET, LONDON.\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To seize a character, even that of one man, in its life and secret\r\nmechanism, requires a philosopher; to delineate it with truth and\r\nimpressiveness is work for a poet. How then shall one or two sleek\r\nclerical tutors, with here and there a tedium-stricken esquire, or\r\nspeculative half-pay captain, give us views on such a subject? How shall\r\na man, to whom all characters of individual men are like sealed books,\r\nof which he sees only the title and the covers, decipher from his\r\nfour-wheeled vehicle, and depict to us, the character of a nation? He\r\ncourageously depicts his own optical delusions; notes this to be\r\nincomprehensible, that other to be insignificant; much to be good, much\r\nto be bad, and most of all indifferent; and so, with a few flowing\r\nstrokes, completes a picture, which, though it may not resemble any\r\npossible object, his countrymen are to take for a national portrait. Nor\r\nis the fraud so readily detected: for the character of a people has\r\nsuch a complexity of aspect, that even the honest observer knows not\r\nalways, not perhaps after long inspection, what to determine regarding\r\nit. From his, only accidental, point of view, the figure stands before\r\nhim like the tracings on veined marble,--a mass of mere random lines,\r\nand tints, and entangled strokes, out of which a lively fancy may shape\r\nalmost _any_ image. But the image he brings with him is always the\r\nreadiest; this is tried; it answers as well as another; and a second\r\nvoucher now testifies its correctness. Thus each, in confident tones,\r\nthough it be with a secret misgiving, repeats his precursor; the\r\nhundred-times-repeated comes in the end to be believed; the foreign\r\nnation is now once for all understood, decided on, and registered\r\naccordingly; and dunce the thousandth writes of it like dunce the\r\nfirst.\"--_Edinburgh Review, No._ xlvi. p. 309.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passage cannot but strike upon the heart of any traveller who\r\nmeditates giving to the world an account of the foreign country he has\r\nvisited. It is the mirror held up before his face; and he inevitably\r\nfeels himself, for the moment, \"dunce the thousandth.\" For my own part,\r\nI felt the truth contained in this picture so strongly, before I was\r\nacquainted with the passage itself, that I had again and again put away\r\nthe idea of saying one word in print on the condition of society in the\r\nUnited States. Whenever I encountered half-a-dozen irreconcilable, but\r\nrespectable opinions on a single point of political doctrine; whenever\r\nhalf-a-dozen fair-seeming versions of a single fact were offered to me;\r\nwhenever the glow of pleasure at obtaining, by some trivial accident, a\r\npiece of important knowledge passed into a throb of pain at the thought\r\nof how much must remain concealed where a casual glimpse disclosed so\r\nmuch; whenever I felt how I, with my pittance of knowledge and amidst my\r\nglimmerings of conviction, was at the mercy of unmanageable\r\ncircumstances, wafted now here and now there, by the currents of\r\nopinion, like one surveying a continent from a balloon, with only\r\nstarlight above him,--I was tempted to decline the task of generalising\r\nat all from what I saw and heard. In the intervals, however, I felt that\r\nthis would be wrong. Men will never arrive at a knowledge of each other,\r\nif those who have the opportunity of foreign observation refuse to\r\nrelate what they think they have learned; or even to lay before others\r\nthe materials from which they themselves hesitate to construct a theory,\r\nor draw large conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn seeking for methods by which I might communicate what I have observed\r\nin my travels, without offering any pretension to teach the English, or\r\njudge the Americans, two expedients occurred to me; both of which I have\r\nadopted. One is, to compare the existing state of society in America\r\nwith the principles on which it is professedly founded; thus testing\r\nInstitutions, Morals, and Manners by an indisputable, instead of an\r\narbitrary standard, and securing to myself the same point of view with\r\nmy readers of both nations.\r\n\r\nIn working according to this method, my principal dangers are two. I am\r\nin danger of not fully apprehending the principles on which society in\r\nthe United States is founded; and of erring in the application to these\r\nof the facts which came under my notice. In the last respect, I am\r\nutterly hopeless of my own accuracy. It is in the highest degree\r\nimprobable that my scanty gleanings in the wide field of American\r\nsociety should present a precisely fair sample of the whole. I can only\r\nexplain that I have spared no pains to discover the truth, in both\r\ndivisions of my task; and invite correction, in all errors of fact. This\r\nI earnestly do; holding myself, of course, an equal judge with others on\r\nmatters of opinion.\r\n\r\nMy readers, on their part, will bear in mind that, in showing\r\ndiscrepancies between an actual condition and a pure and noble theory\r\nof society, I am not finding fault with the Americans, as for falling\r\nbehind the English, or the French, or any other nation. I decline the\r\noffice of censor altogether. I dare not undertake it. Nor will my\r\nreaders, I trust, regard the subject otherwise than as a compound of\r\nphilosophy and fact. If we can all, for once, allay our personal\r\nfeelings, dismiss our too great regard to mutual opinion, and put praise\r\nand blame as nearly as possible out of the question, more that is\r\nadvantageous to us may perhaps be learned than by any invidious\r\ncomparisons and proud judgments that were ever instituted and\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nThe other method by which I propose to lessen my own responsibility, is\r\nto enable my readers to judge for themselves, better than I can for\r\nthem, what my testimony is worth. For this purpose, I offer a brief\r\naccount of my travels, with dates in full; and a report of the principal\r\nmeans I enjoyed of obtaining a knowledge of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the close of a long work which I completed in 1834, it was thought\r\ndesirable that I should travel for two years. I determined to go to the\r\nUnited States, chiefly because I felt a strong curiosity to witness the\r\nactual working of republican institutions; and partly because the\r\ncircumstance of the language being the same as my own is very important\r\nto one who, like myself, is too deaf to enjoy anything like an average\r\nopportunity of obtaining correct knowledge, where intercourse is carried\r\non in a foreign language. I went with a mind, I believe, as nearly as\r\npossible unprejudiced about America, with a strong disposition to admire\r\ndemocratic institutions, but an entire ignorance how far the people of\r\nthe United States lived up to, or fell below, their own theory. I had\r\nread whatever I could lay hold of that had been written about them; but\r\nwas unable to satisfy myself that, after all, I understood anything\r\nwhatever of their condition. As to knowledge of them, my mind was nearly\r\na blank: as to opinion of their state, I did not carry the germ of one.\r\n\r\nI landed at New York on the 19th of September, 1834: paid a short visit\r\nthe next week to Paterson, in New Jersey, to see the cotton factories\r\nthere, and the falls of the Passaic; and passed through New York again\r\non my way to stay with some friends on the banks of the Hudson, and at\r\nStockbridge, Massachusetts. On the 6th of October, I joined some\r\ncompanions at Albany, with whom I travelled through the State of New\r\nYork, seeing Trenton Falls, Auburn, and Buffalo, to the Falls of\r\nNiagara. Here I remained nearly a week; then, after spending a few days\r\nat Buffalo, I embarked on Lake Erie, landing in the back of\r\nPennsylvania, and travelling down through Meadville to Pittsburgh,\r\nspending a few days at each place. Then, over the Alleghanies to\r\nNorthumberland, on the fork of the Susquehanna, the abode of Priestley\r\nafter his exile, and his burial place. I arrived at Northumberland on\r\nthe 11th of October, and left it, after visiting some villages in the\r\nneighbourhood, on the 17th, for Philadelphia, where I remained nearly\r\nsix weeks, having very extensive intercourses with its various society.\r\nMy stay at Baltimore was three weeks, and at Washington five. Congress\r\nwas at that time in session, and I enjoyed peculiar opportunities of\r\nwitnessing the proceedings of the Supreme Court and both houses of\r\nCongress. I was acquainted with almost every eminent senator and\r\nrepresentative, both on the administration and opposition sides; and was\r\non friendly and intimate terms with some of the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt. I enjoyed the hospitality of the President, and of several of the\r\nheads of departments: and was, like everybody else, in society from\r\nmorning till night of every day; as the custom is at Washington. One\r\nday was devoted to a visit to Mount Vernon, the abode and burial-place\r\nof Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February I arrived at Montpelier, the seat of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Madison, with whom I spent two days, which were wholly occupied\r\nwith rapid conversation; Mr. Madison's share of which, various and\r\nbeautiful to a remarkable degree, will never be forgotten by me. His\r\nclear reports of the principles and history of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, his insight into the condition, his speculations on the\r\nprospects of nations, his wise playfulness, his placid contemplation of\r\npresent affairs, his abundant household anecdotes of Washington,\r\nFranklin, and Jefferson, were incalculably valuable and exceedingly\r\ndelightful to me.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse which I had with Chief Justice Marshall was of the same\r\ncharacter, though not nearly so copious. Nothing in either delighted me\r\nmore than their hearty admiration of each other, notwithstanding some\r\nwide differences in their political views. They are both gone; and I now\r\ndeeply feel what a privilege it is to have known them.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Madison's I proceeded to Charlottesville, and passed two days\r\namidst the hospitalities of the Professors of Jefferson's University,\r\nand their families. I was astonished to learn that this institution had\r\nnever before been visited by a British traveller. I can only be sorry\r\nfor British travellers who have missed the pleasure. A few days more\r\nwere given to Richmond, where the Virginia legislature was in session;\r\nand then ensued a long wintry journey though North and South Carolina to\r\nCharleston, occupying from the 2nd to the 11th of March. The\r\nhospitalities of Charleston are renowned; and I enjoyed them in their\r\nperfection for a fortnight; and then a renewal of the same kind of\r\npleasures at Columbia, South Carolina, for ten days. I traversed the\r\nsouthern States, staying three days at Augusta, Georgia, and nearly a\r\nfortnight in and near Montgomery, Alabama; descending next the Alabama\r\nriver to Mobile. After a short stay there, and a residence of ten days\r\nat New Orleans, I went up the Mississippi and Ohio to the mouth of the\r\nCumberland river, which I ascended to Nashville, Tennessee. I visited\r\nthe Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and spent three weeks at Lexington. I\r\ndescended the Ohio to Cincinnati; and after staying there ten days,\r\nascended the river again, landing in Virginia, visiting the Hawk's Nest,\r\nSulphur Springs, Natural Bridge, and Weyer's Cave, arriving at New York\r\nagain on the 14th of July, 1835. The autumn was spent among the villages\r\nand smaller towns of Massachusetts, in a visit to Dr. Channing in Rhode\r\nIsland, and in an excursion to the mountains of New Hampshire and\r\nVermont. The winter was passed in Boston, with the exception of a trip\r\nto Plymouth, for \"Forefather's Day.\" In the Spring I spent seven weeks\r\nin New York; and a month in a farmhouse at Stockbridge, Massachusetts;\r\nmaking an excursion, meanwhile, to Saratoga and Lake George. My last\r\njourney was with a party of friends, far into the west, visiting Niagara\r\nagain, proceeding by Lake Erie to Detroit, and across the territory of\r\nMichigan. We swept round the southern extremity of Lake Michigan to\r\nChicago: went a long day's journey down into the prairies, back to\r\nChicago, and by the Lakes Michigan, Huron, and St. Clair to Detroit,\r\nvisiting Mackinaw by the way. We landed from Lake Erie at Cleveland,\r\nOhio, on the 13th of July; and travelled through the interior of Ohio\r\ntill we joined the river at Beaver. We visited Rapp's Settlement at\r\nEconomy, on the Ohio, and returned to New York from Pittsburgh, by the\r\ncanal route through Pennsylvania, and the rail-road over the\r\nAlleghanies. I sailed from New York for England on the 1st of August,\r\n1836, having then been absent just two years.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this tour, I visited almost every kind of institution.\r\nThe prisons of Auburn, Philadelphia, and Nashville: the insane and other\r\nhospitals of almost every considerable place: the literary and\r\nscientific institutions; the factories of the north; the plantations of\r\nthe south; the farms of the west. I lived in houses which might be\r\ncalled palaces, in log-houses, and in a farm-house. I travelled much in\r\nwagons, as well as stages; also on horseback, and in some of the best\r\nand worst of steam-boats. I saw weddings, and christenings; the\r\ngatherings of the richer at watering places, and of the humbler at\r\ncountry festivals. I was present at orations, at land sales, and in the\r\nslave market. I was in frequent attendance on the Supreme Court and the\r\nSenate; and witnessed some of the proceedings of state legislatures.\r\nAbove all, I was received into the bosom of many families, not as a\r\nstranger, but as a daughter or a sister. I am qualified, if any one is,\r\nto testify to the virtues and the peace of the homes of the United\r\nStates; and let it not be thought a breach of confidence, if I should be\r\nfound occasionally to have spoken of these out of the fulness of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIt would be nearly impossible to relate whom I knew, during my travels.\r\nNearly every eminent man in politics, science and literature, and\r\nalmost every distinguished woman, would grace my list. I have respected\r\nand beloved friends of each political party; and of nearly every\r\nreligious denomination; among slave-holders, colonizationists, and\r\nabolitionists; among farmers, lawyers, merchants, professors, and\r\nclergy. I travelled among several tribes of Indians; and spent months in\r\nthe southern States, with negroes ever at my heels.\r\n\r\nSuch were my means of information. With regard to my power of making use\r\nof them, I have but a few words to say.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently mentioned to me that my being a woman was one\r\ndisadvantage; and my being previously heard of, another. In this I do\r\nnot agree.\r\n\r\nI am sure, I have seen much more of domestic life than could possibly\r\nhave been exhibited to any gentleman travelling through the country. The\r\nnursery, the boudoir, the kitchen, are all excellent schools in which to\r\nlearn the morals and manners of a people: and, as for public and\r\nprofessional affairs,--those may always gain full information upon such\r\nmatters, who really feel an interest in them,--be they men or women. No\r\npeople in the world can be more frank, confiding and affectionate, or\r\nmore skilful and liberal in communicating information, than I have ever\r\nfound the Americans to be. I never asked in vain; and I seldom had to\r\nask at all; so carefully were my inquiries anticipated, and my aims so\r\ncompletely understood. I doubt whether a single fact that I wished to\r\nlearn, or any doctrine that I desired to comprehend, was ever kept from\r\nme because I was a woman.\r\n\r\nAs for the other objection, I can only state my belief, that my friends\r\nand I found personal acquaintance so much pleasanter than any previous\r\nknowledge by hearsay, that we always forgot that we had heard of each\r\nother before. It would be preposterous to suppose that, received as I\r\nwas into intimate confidence, any false appearances could be kept up on\r\naccount of any preconceptions that could have been entertained of me.\r\n\r\nI laboured under only one peculiar disadvantage, that I am aware of; but\r\nthat one is incalculable. I mean my deafness. This does not endanger the\r\naccuracy of my information, I believe, as far as it goes; because I\r\ncarry a trumpet of remarkable fidelity; an instrument, moreover, which\r\nseems to exert some winning power, by which I gain more in\r\n_tête-à-têtes_ than is given to people who hear general conversation.\r\nProbably its charm consists in the new feeling which it imparts of ease\r\nand privacy in conversing with a deaf person. However this may be, I can\r\nhardly imagine fuller revelations to be made in household intercourse\r\nthan my trumpet brought to me. But I am aware that there is no\r\nestimating the loss, in a foreign country, from not hearing the casual\r\nconversation of all kinds of people, in the streets, stages, hotels, &c.\r\nI am aware that the lights which are thus gathered up by the traveller\r\nfor himself are often far more valuable than the most elaborate accounts\r\nof things offered to him with an express design. This was my peculiar\r\ndisadvantage. It could not be helped; and it cannot be explained away. I\r\nmention it, that the value of my testimony may be lowered according to\r\nthe supposed worth of this circumstance.\r\n\r\nMuch is often said about the delicacy to be observed, in the act of\r\nrevealing the history of one's travels, towards the hosts and other\r\nfriends of the traveller who have reposed confidence in him. The rule\r\nseems to me a very plain one, which reconciles truth, honour and\r\nutility. My rule is to speak of the public acts of public persons,\r\nprecisely as if I had known them only in their public character. This\r\nmay be sometimes difficult, and sometimes painful, to the writer; but it\r\nleaves no just cause of complaint to any one else. Moreover, I hold it\r\nallowable and necessary to make use of opinions and facts offered in\r\nfire-side confidence, as long as no clue is offered by which they may be\r\ntraced back to any particular fire-side. If any of my American friends\r\nshould find in this book traces of old conversations and incidents, let\r\nthem keep their own counsel, and be assured that the conversation and\r\nfacts remain private between them and me. Thus far, all is safe; and\r\nfurther than this, no honourable person would wish to go.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place in which to speak of my obligations or of my\r\nfriendships. Those who know best what I have in my heart to say meet me\r\nhere under a new relation. In these pages, we meet as writer and\r\nreaders. I would only entreat them to bear this distinction in mind, and\r\nnot to measure my attachment to themselves by anything this book may\r\ncontain about their country and their nation. The bond which unites us\r\nbears no relation to clime, birth-place, or institutions. In as far as\r\nour friendship is faithful, we are fellow-citizens of another and a\r\nbetter country than theirs or mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nVOL.

Those unalterable relations which Providence has ordained\r\n     that everything should bear to every other. These relations, which\r\n     are truth itself, the foundation of virtue, and consequently, the\r\n     only measures of happiness, should be likewise the only measures by\r\n     which we should direct our reasoning. To these we should conform in\r\n     good earnest, and not think to force nature, and the whole order of\r\n     her system, by a compliance with our pride and folly, to conform to\r\n     our artificial regulations. It is by a conformity to this method we\r\n     owe the discovery of the few truths we know, and the little liberty\r\n     and rational happiness we enjoy.\" _Burke._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Madison remarked to me, that the United States had been \"useful in\r\nproving things before held impossible.\" Of such proofs, he adduced\r\nseveral. Others, which he did not mention, have since occurred to me;\r\nand, among them, the pursuit of the _à priori_ method in forming a\r\nconstitution:--the _à priori_ method, as it is styled by its enemies,\r\nthough its advocates, with more reason, call it the inductive method.\r\nTill the formation of the government of the United States, it had been\r\ngenerally supposed, and it is so still by the majority of the old world,\r\nthat a sound theory of government can be constructed only out of the\r\nexperience of man in governments; the experience mankind has had of\r\ndespotisms, oligarchies, and the mixtures of these with small portions\r\nof democracy. But the essential condition of the fidelity of the\r\ninductive method is, that all the elements of experience should be\r\nincluded. If, in this particular problem, of the true theory of\r\ngovernment, we take all experience of government, and leave out all\r\nexperience of man, except in his hitherto governing or governed state,\r\nwe shall never reach a philosophical conclusion. The true application of\r\nthe inductive method here is to test a theory of government deduced from\r\nthe principles of human nature, by the results of all governments of\r\nwhich mankind has had experience. No narrower basis will serve for such\r\nan induction. Such a method of finding a good theory of government was\r\nconsidered impossible, till the United States \"proved\" it.\r\n\r\nThis proof can never be invalidated by anything that can now happen in\r\nthe United States. It is common to say \"Wait; these are early days. The\r\nexperiment will fail yet.\" The experiment of the particular constitution\r\nof the United States may fail; but the great principle which, whether\r\nsuccessfully or not, it strives to embody,--the capacity of mankind for\r\nself-government,--is established for ever. It has, as Mr. Madison said,\r\nproved a thing previously held impossible. If a revolution were to take\r\nplace to-morrow in the United States, it remains an historical fact\r\nthat, for half a century, a people has been self-governed; and, till it\r\ncan be proved that the self-government is the cause of the instability,\r\nno revolution, or series of revolutions, can tarnish the lustre, any\r\nmore than they can impair the soundness of the principle that mankind\r\nare capable of self-government. The United States have indeed been\r\nuseful in proving these two things, before held impossible; the finding\r\na true theory of government, by reasoning from the principles of human\r\nnature, as well as from the experience of governments; and the capacity\r\nof mankind for self-government.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that while politics are unquestionably a branch of\r\nmoral science, bearing no other relation than to the duty and happiness\r\nof man, the great principles of his nature should have been neglected by\r\npoliticians--with the exception of his love of power and desire of\r\ngain,--till a set of men assembled in the State House at Philadelphia,\r\nin the eighteenth century, and there throned a legitimate political\r\nphilosophy in the place of a deposed king. The _rationale_ of all\r\npreceding governments had been, \"men love power, therefore there must be\r\npunishments for rulers who, having already much, would seize more. Men\r\ndesire gain; therefore there must be punishments for those, rulers or\r\nruled, who would appropriate the gains of others.\" The _rationale_ of\r\nthe new and \"impossible\" government is \"that all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable lights;\r\nthat among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to\r\nsecure those rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving\r\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed.\"[1] This last\r\nrecognizes, over and above what the former admits, the great principles\r\nof indefeasible rights; human equality in relation to these; and the\r\nobligation of universal justice.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the principles which the statesmen in the State House\r\nat Philadelphia announced as the soul of their embryo institutions; and\r\nthe rule through which they were to work was no less than that golden\r\none which seems to have been, by some unhappy chance, omitted in the\r\nbibles of other statesmen--\"Do unto others as ye would that they should\r\ndo unto you.\" Perhaps it may be reserved for their country to prove yet\r\none more impossible thing--that men can live by the rule which their\r\nMaker has given them to live by. Meanwhile, every true citizen of that\r\ncountry must necessarily be content to have his self-government tried by\r\nthe test of these principles, to which, by his citizenship, he has\r\nbecome a subscriber. He will scorn all comparisons, instituted as a test\r\nof merit, between his own government and those of other countries, which\r\nhe must necessarily consider as of narrower scope and lower aim. Whether\r\nsuch comparisons be instituted abroad in a spirit of contempt, or at\r\nhome in a spirit of complacency, he will regard them equally as\r\nirrelevant, and proving nothing to the best purposes of true citizens.\r\nHe will disdain every test but that furnished by the great principles\r\npropounded in the State House at Philadelphia; and he will quarrel with\r\nno results fairly brought out by such a test, whether they inspire him\r\nwith shame, or with complacency. In either case, he will be animated by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf the politics of a country be really derived from fundamental\r\nprinciples of human nature and morals, the economy, manners, and\r\nreligion of that country must be designed to harmonise with these\r\nprinciples. The same test must be applicable to all. The inalienable\r\nright of all the human race to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness, must control the economical, as well as the political\r\narrangements of a people; and the law of universal justice must regulate\r\nall social intercourse, and direct all administration of religion.\r\n\r\nPolitics are morals, all the world over; that is, politics universally\r\nimplicate the duty and happiness of man. Every branch of morals is, and\r\nought to be considered, a universal concern. Under despotic governments,\r\nthere is a pretension, more or less sincere, on the part of the rulers,\r\nto moral regards; but from these the bulk of the people are, by common\r\nconsent, cut off. If the bulk of the people saw the truth, that the\r\nprinciples of politics affect them,--are the message of their Maker as\r\nprinciples are to them, as well as to their rulers, they would become\r\nmoral agents in regard to politics, and despotism would be at an end. As\r\nit is, they pay their taxes, and go out to war when they are bid, are\r\nthankful when they are left unmolested by their government, and sorry or\r\nangry when they feel themselves oppressed; and there they end. It is\r\nowing to their ignorance of politics being morals--_i. e._ matters of\r\nequal concern to all--that this truth is not made manifest in action in\r\nevery country on the globe that has any government at all.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case of the unrepresented under governments which are\r\nnot called despotic. According to the principles professed by the United\r\nStates, there is there a rectification of this mighty error--a\r\ncorrection of this grand oversight. In that self-governing nation, all\r\nare held to have an equal interest in the principles of its\r\ninstitutions, and to be bound in equal duty to watch their workings.\r\nPolitics there are universal duty. None are exempted from obligation but\r\nthe unrepresented; and they, in theory, are none. However various may be\r\nthe tribes of inhabitants in those States, whatever part of the world\r\nmay have been their birth-place, or that of their fathers, however\r\nbroken may be their language, however noble or servile their\r\nemployments, however exalted or despised their state, all are declared\r\nto be bound together by equal political obligation, as firmly as under\r\nany other law of personal or social duty. The president, the senator,\r\nthe governor, may take upon himself some additional responsibility, as\r\nthe physician and lawyer do in other departments of office; but they\r\nare under precisely the same political obligation as the German settler,\r\nwhose axe echoes through the lonely forest; and the Southern planter,\r\nwho is occupied with his hospitalities; and the New England merchant,\r\nwhose thoughts are on the sea; and the Irishman, in his shanty on the\r\ncanal-bank; and the negro, hoeing cotton in the hot field, or basking\r\naway his sabbath on the shore of the Mississippi. Genius, knowledge,\r\nwealth, may in other affairs set a man above his fellows; but not in\r\nthis. Weakness, ignorance, poverty may exempt a man from other\r\nobligations; but not from this. The theory of the government of the\r\nUnited States has grasped and embodied the mighty principle, that\r\npolitics are morals;--that is, a matter of universal and equal concern.\r\nWe shall have to see whether this principle is fully acted out.\r\n\r\nImplicated with this is the theory, that the majority will be in the\r\nright, both as to the choice of principles which are to govern\r\nparticular cases, and the agents who are to work them. This theory,\r\nobviously just as it appears, as long as it is applied to matters of\r\nuniversal and equal concern, cannot be set aside without overthrowing\r\nall with which it is involved. We shall have to see, also, whether this\r\nprinciple is effectually carried out.\r\n\r\nImplicated with this, again, is the principle that a mutable, or rather\r\nelastic form, must be given to every institution. \"The majority are in\r\nthe right.\" Such is the theory. Few individuals of this majority can act\r\nfor longer than two-score years and ten; few for so long. No one can\r\nsuppose that his successor will think or feel as he does, however strict\r\nmay be the regard of each to the fundamental principles which are to\r\nregulate his citizenship. It is absolutely necessary, to secure\r\npermanence to the recognition of those principles, that there should be\r\nliberty to change the form which contains them. Else, in the endless\r\nvariety of human views and interests, there is danger lest men, being\r\nprohibited from producing a correspondence between the principles they\r\nrecognise, and the forms they desire, should, because interdicted from\r\noutward change, gradually alter the spirit of their government. In such\r\na case, men would be some time in discovering that the fair body of\r\ntheir constitution has become possessed, while they had supposed her\r\ninspired: and, to pass over the mischiefs which might happen during the\r\nperiod of her possession, the work of exorcism would be difficult and\r\nperilous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPARTIES.\r\n\r\n     \"For these are the men that, when they have played their parts, and\r\n     had their exits, must step out, and give the moral of their scenes,\r\n     and deliver unto posterity an inventory of their virtues and\r\n     vices.\"\r\n\r\n     _Sir Thomas Browne._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first gentleman who greeted me on my arrival in the United States, a\r\nfew minutes after I had landed, informed me without delay, that I had\r\narrived at an unhappy crisis; that the institutions of the country would\r\nbe in ruins before my return to England; that the levelling spirit was\r\ndesolating society; and that the United States were on the verge of a\r\nmilitary despotism. This was so very like what I had been accustomed to\r\nhear at home, from time to time, since my childhood, that I was not\r\nquite so much alarmed as I might have been without such prior\r\nexperience. It was amusing too to find America so veritably the daughter\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nI looked around me carefully, in all my travels, till I reached\r\nWashington, but could see no signs of despotism; even less of military.\r\nExcept the officers and cadets at West Point, and some militia on a\r\ntraining day at Saugerties, higher up on the Hudson, I saw nothing that\r\ncould be called military; and officers, cadets, and militia, appeared\r\nall perfectly innocent of any design to seize upon the government. At\r\nWashington, I ventured to ask an explanation from one of the most\r\nhonoured statesmen now living; who told me, with a smile, that the\r\ncountry had been in \"a crisis\" for fifty years past; and would be for\r\nfifty years to come.\r\n\r\nThis information was my comfort, from day to day, till I became\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the country to need such support no longer.\r\nMournful predictions, like that I have quoted, were made so often, that\r\nit was easy to learn how they originated.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as elsewhere, there are, and have always been, two\r\nparties in politics, whom it is difficult to distinguish on paper, by a\r\nstatement of their principles, but whose course of action may, in any\r\ngiven case, be pretty confidently anticipated. It is remarkable how\r\nnearly their positive statements of political doctrine agree, while they\r\ndiffer in almost every possible application of their common principles.\r\nClose and continued observation of their agreements and differences is\r\nnecessary before the British traveller can fully comprehend their mutual\r\nrelation. In England, the differences of parties are so broad,--between\r\nthose who would have the people governed for the convenience of their\r\nrulers; those who would have the many governed, for their good, by the\r\nwill of the few; and those who would have the people govern\r\nthemselves;--that it is, for some time, difficult to comprehend how\r\nthere should be party differences as wide in a country where the first\r\nprinciple of government is that the people are to govern themselves. The\r\ncase, however, becomes clear in time: and, amidst a half century of\r\n\"crises,\" the same order and sequence become discernible which run\r\nthrough the whole course of human affairs.\r\n\r\nAs long as men continue as differently organized as they now are, there\r\nwill be two parties under every government. Even if their outward\r\nfortunes could be absolutely equalised, there would be, from individual\r\nconstitution alone, an aristocracy and a democracy in every land. The\r\nfearful by nature would compose an aristocracy, the hopeful by nature a\r\ndemocracy, were all other causes of divergence done away. When to these\r\nconstitutional differences are added all those outward circumstances\r\nwhich go to increase the fear and the hope, the mutual misunderstandings\r\nof parties are no longer to be wondered at. Men who have gained wealth,\r\nwhose hope is fulfilled, and who fear loss by change, are naturally of\r\nthe aristocratic class. So are men of learning, who, unconsciously\r\nidentifying learning and wisdom, fear the elevation of the ignorant to a\r\nstation like their own. So are men of talent, who, having gained the\r\npower which is the fit recompense of achievement, dread the having to\r\nyield it to numbers instead of desert. So are many more who feel the\r\nalmost universal fear of having to part with educational prejudices,\r\nwith doctrines with which honoured teachers nourished the pride of\r\nyouth, and prepossessions inwoven with all that has been to them most\r\npure, lofty, and graceful. Out of these a large aristocratic class must\r\neverywhere be formed.\r\n\r\nOut of the hopeful,--the rising, not the risen,--the aspiring, not the\r\nsatisfied,--must a still larger class be everywhere formed. It will\r\ninclude all who have most to gain and least to lose; and most of those\r\nwho, in the present state of education, have gained their knowledge from\r\nactual life, rather than, or as well as, from books. It will include the\r\nadventurers of society, and also the philanthropists. It will include,\r\nmoreover,--an accession small in number, but inestimable in power,--the\r\nmen of genius. It is characteristic of genius to be hopeful and\r\naspiring. It is characteristic of genius to break up the artificial\r\narrangements of conventionalism, and to view mankind in true\r\nperspective, in their gradations of inherent rather than of adventitious\r\nworth. Genius is therefore essentially democratic, and has always been\r\nso, whatever titles its gifted ones may have worn, or on whatever\r\nsubjects they may have exercised their gifts. To whatever extent men of\r\ngenius have been aristocratic, they have been so in spite of their\r\ngenius, not in consistency with it. The instances are so few, and their\r\ndeviations from the democratic principle so small, that men of genius\r\nmust be considered as included in the democratic class.\r\n\r\nGenius being rare, and its claims but tardily allowed by those who have\r\nattained greatness by other means, it seems as if the weight of\r\ninfluence possessed by the aristocratic party,--by that party which,\r\ngenerally speaking, includes the wealth, learning, and talents of the\r\ncountry,--must overpower all opposition. If this is found not to be the\r\ncase, if it be found that the democratic party has achieved everything\r\nthat has been achieved since the United States' constitution began to\r\nwork, it is no wonder that there is panic in many hearts, and that I\r\nheard from so many tongues of the desolations of the \"levelling spirit,\"\r\nand the approaching ruin of political institutions.\r\n\r\nThese classes may be distinguished in another way. The description which\r\nJefferson gave of the federal and republican parties of 1799 applies to\r\nthe federal and democratic parties of this day, and to the aristocratic\r\nand democratic parties of every time and country. \"One,\" says Jefferson,\r\n\"fears most the ignorance of the people; the other, the selfishness of\r\nrulers independent of them.\"\r\n\r\nThere is much reason in both these fears. The unreasonableness of party\r\nlies in entertaining the one fear, and not the other. No argument is\r\nneeded to prove that rulers are prone to selfishness and narrowness of\r\nviews: and no one can have witnessed the injuries that the poor suffer\r\nin old countries,--the education of hardship and insult that furnishes\r\nthem with their only knowledge of the highest classes, without being\r\nconvinced that their ignorance is to be feared;--their ignorance, not so\r\nmuch of books as of liberty and law. In old countries, the question\r\nremains open whether the many should, on account of their ignorance, be\r\nkept still in a state of political servitude, as some declare; or\r\nwhether they should be gradually prepared for political freedom, as\r\nothers think, by an amelioration of their condition, and by being\r\neducated in schools; or whether, as yet others maintain, the exercise of\r\npolitical rights and duties be not the only possible political\r\neducation. In the New World, no such question remains to be debated. It\r\nhas no large, degraded, injured, dangerous (white) class who can afford\r\nthe slightest pretence for a panic-cry about agrarianism. Throughout the\r\nprodigious expanse of that country, I saw no poor _men_, except a few\r\nintemperate ones. I saw some very poor _women_; but God and man know\r\nthat the time has not come for women to make their injuries even heard\r\nof. I saw no beggars but two professional ones, who are making their\r\nfortunes in the streets of Washington. I saw no table spread, in the\r\nlowest order of houses, that had not meat and bread on it. Every factory\r\nchild carries its umbrella; and pig-drivers wear spectacles. With the\r\nexception of the foreign paupers on the seaboard, and those who are\r\nsteeped in sensual vice, neither of which classes can be politically\r\ndangerous, there are none who have not the same interest in the security\r\nof property as the richest merchant of Salem, or planter of Louisiana.\r\nWhether the less wealthy class will not be the first to draw out from\r\nreason and experience the true philosophy of property, is another\r\nquestion. All we have to do with now is their equal interest with their\r\nricher neighbours in the security of property, in the present state of\r\nsociety. Law and order are as important to the man who holds land for\r\nthe subsistence of his family, or who earns wages that he may have land\r\nof his own to die upon, as to any member of the president's cabinet.\r\n\r\nNor is there much more to fear from the ignorance of the bulk of the\r\npeople in the United States, than from their poverty. It is too true\r\nthat there is much ignorance; so much as to be an ever-present peril.\r\nThough, as a whole, the nation is, probably, better informed than any\r\nother entire nation, it cannot be denied that their knowledge is far\r\ninferior to what their safety and their virtue require. But _whose_\r\nignorance is it? And ignorance of _what_? If the professors of colleges\r\nhave book-knowledge, which the owner of a log-house has not; the owner\r\nof a log-house has very often, as I can testify, a knowledge of natural\r\nlaw, political rights, and economical fact, which the college-professor\r\nhas not. I often longed to confront some of each class, to see whether\r\nthere was any common ground on which they could meet. If not, the one\r\nmight bring the charge of ignorance as justly as the other. If a common\r\nground could be discovered, it would have been in their equal relation\r\nto the government under which they live: in which case, the natural\r\nconclusion would be, that each understood his own interests best, and\r\nneither could assume superiority over the other. The particular\r\nignorance of the countryman may expose him to be flattered and cheated\r\nby an oratorical office-seeker, or a dishonest newspaper. But, on the\r\nother hand, the professor's want of knowledge of the actual affairs of\r\nthe many, and his educational biases, are just as likely to cause him to\r\nvote contrary to the public interest. No one who has observed society in\r\nAmerica will question the existence or the evil of ignorance there: but\r\nneither will he question that such real knowledge as they have is pretty\r\nfairly shared among them.\r\n\r\nI travelled by wagon, with a party of friends, in the interior of Ohio.\r\nOur driver must be a man of great and various knowledge, if he questions\r\nall strangers as he did us, and obtains as copious answers. He told us\r\nwhere and how he lived, of his nine children, of his literary daughters,\r\nand the pains he was at to get books for them; and of his hopes from his\r\ngirl of fourteen, who writes poetry, which he keeps a secret, lest she\r\nshould be spoiled. He told us that he seldom lets his fingers touch a\r\nnovel, because the consequence always is that his business stands still\r\ntill the novel is finished; \"and that doesn't suit.\" He recited to us,\r\nPope's \"Happy the man whose wish and care,\" &c. saying that it suited\r\nhis idea exactly. He asked both the ladies present whether they had\r\nwritten a book. Both had; and he carried away the titles, that he might\r\nbuy the books for his daughters. This man is fully informed of the value\r\nof the Union, as we had reason to perceive; and it is difficult to see\r\nwhy he is not as fit as any other man to choose the representatives of\r\nhis interests. Yet, here is a specimen of his conversation with one of\r\nthe ladies of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Was the book that you wrote on natural philosophy, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I know nothing about natural philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! Because one lady has done that pretty well:--hit it!--Miss Porter,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Miss Porter?\"\r\n\r\n\"She that wrote 'Thaddeus of Warsaw,' you know. She did it pretty well\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nAs an antagonist case, take the wailings of a gentleman of very\r\ndistinguished station in a highly aristocratic section of\r\nsociety;--wailings over the extent of the suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"What an enormity it is that such a man as Judge ----, there, should\r\nstand on no higher level in politics than the man that grooms his\r\nhorse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he? I suppose they have both got all they want,--full\r\nrepresentation: and they thus bear precisely the same relation to the\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the judge seldom votes, because of his office: while his groom can,\r\nperhaps, carry nineteen men to vote as he pleases. It is monstrous!\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems monstrous that the judge should omit his political duty for\r\nthe sake of his office; and also that nineteen men should be led by one.\r\nBut limiting the suffrage would not mend the matter. Would it not do\r\nbetter to teach all the parties their duty?\"\r\n\r\nLet who will choose between the wagon-driver and the scholar. Each will\r\nvote according to his own views; and the event,--the ultimate\r\nmajority,--will prove which is so far the wiser.\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of the antagonism between the two parties is for some time\r\nperplexing to the traveller in America; and he does not know whether to\r\nbe most amazed or amused at the apparent triviality of the circumstances\r\nwhich arouse the strongest party emotions. After a while, a body comes\r\nout of the mystery, and he grasps a substantial cause of dissension.\r\nFrom the day when the first constitution was formed, there have been\r\nalarmists, who talk of a \"crisis:\" and from the day when the second\r\nbegan its operations, the alarm has, very naturally, taken its subject\r\nmatter from the failure of the first. The first general government came\r\nto a stand through weakness. The entire nation kept itself in order till\r\na new one was formed and set to work. As soon as the danger was over,\r\nand the nation proved, by the last possible test, duly convinced of the\r\nadvantages of public order, the timid party took fright lest the general\r\ngovernment should still not be strong enough; and this tendency, of\r\ncourse, set the hopeful party to watch lest it should be made too\r\nstrong. The panic and antagonism were at their height in 1799.[2] A\r\nfearful collision of parties took place, which ended in the\r\nestablishment of the hopeful policy, which has continued, with few\r\ninterruptions, since. The executive patronage was retrenched, taxes were\r\ntaken off, the people were re-assured, and all is, as yet, safe. While\r\nthe leaders of the old federal party retired to their Essex junto, and\r\nelsewhere, to sigh for monarchy, and yearn towards England, the greater\r\nnumber threw off their fears, and joined the republican party. There are\r\nnow very few left to profess the politics of the old federalists. I met\r\nwith only two who openly avowed their desire for a monarchy; and not\r\nmany more who prophesied one. But there still is a federal party, and\r\nthere ever will be. It is as inevitable that there will be always some\r\nwho will fear the too great strength of the state governments, as that\r\nthere will be many who will have the same fear about the general\r\ngovernment. Instead of seeing in this any cause for dismay, or even\r\nregret, the impartial observer will recognise in this mutual\r\nwatchfulness the best security that the case admits of for the general\r\nand state governments preserving their due relation to one another. No\r\ngovernment ever yet worked both well and indisputably. A pure despotism\r\nworks (apparently) indisputably; but the bulk of its subjects will not\r\nallow that it works well, while it wrings their heads from their\r\nshoulders, or their earnings from their hands. The government of the\r\nUnited States is disputed at every step of its workings: but the bulk of\r\nthe people declare that it works well, while every man is his own\r\nsecurity for his life and property.\r\n\r\nThe extreme panic of the old federal party is accounted for, and almost\r\njustified, when we remember, not only that the commerce of England had\r\npenetrated every part of the country, and that great pecuniary interests\r\nwere therefore everywhere supposed to be at stake; but that\r\nrepublicanism, like that which now exists in America, was a thing\r\nunheard of--an idea only half-developed in the minds of those who were\r\nto live under it. Wisdom may spring, full-formed and accomplished, from\r\nthe head of a god, but not from the brains of men. The Americans of the\r\nRevolution looked round upon the republics of the world, tested them by\r\nthe principles of human nature, found them republican in nothing but the\r\nname, and produced something, more democratic than any of them; but not\r\ndemocratic enough for the circumstances which were in the course of\r\narising. They saw that in Holland the people had nothing to do with the\r\nerection of the supreme power; that in Poland (which was called a\r\nrepublic in their day) the people were oppressed by an incubus of\r\nmonarchy and aristocracy, at once, in their most aggravated forms; and\r\nthat in Venice a small body of hereditary nobles exercised a stern sway.\r\nThey planned something far transcending in democracy any republic yet\r\nheard of; and they are not to be wondered at, or blamed, if, when their\r\nwork was done, they feared they had gone too far. They had done much in\r\npreparing the way for the second birth of their republic in 1789, and\r\nfor a third in 1801, when the republicans came into power; and from\r\nwhich date, free government in the United States may be said to have\r\nstarted on its course.\r\n\r\nA remarkable sign of those times remains on record, which shows how\r\ndifferent the state of feeling and opinion was then from any that could\r\nnow prevail among a large and honourable body in the republic. The\r\nsociety of the Cincinnati, an association of officers of the\r\nrevolutionary army, and other honourable persons, ordered their\r\nproceedings in a manner totally inconsistent with the first principles\r\nof republicanism; having secret correspondences, decking themselves with\r\nan order, which was to be hereditary, drawing a line of distinction\r\nbetween military and other citizens, and uniting in a secret bond the\r\nchiefs of the first families of the respective States. Such an\r\nassociation, formed on the model of some which might be more or less\r\nnecessary or convenient in the monarchies of the old world, could not be\r\nallowed to exist in its feudal form in the young republic; and,\r\naccordingly, the hereditary principle, and the power of adopting\r\nhonorary members, were relinquished; and the society is heard of no\r\nmore. It has had its use in showing how the minds of the earlier\r\nrepublicans were imbued with monarchical prepossessions, and how large\r\nis the reasonable allowance which must be made for the apprehensions of\r\nmen, who, having gone further in democracy than any who had preceded\r\nthem, were destined to see others outstrip themselves. Adams, Hamilton,\r\nWashington! what names are these! Yet Adams in those days believed the\r\nEnglish constitution would be perfect, if some defects and abuses were\r\nremedied. Hamilton believed it would be impracticable, if such\r\nalterations were made; and that, in its then existing state, it was the\r\nvery best government that had ever been devised. Washington was\r\nabsolutely republican in his principles, but did not enjoy the strong\r\nfaith, the entire trust in the people, which is the attendant privilege\r\nof those principles. Such men, pressed out from among the multitude by\r\nthe strong force of emergency, proved themselves worthy of their mission\r\nof national redemption; but, though we may now be unable to single out\r\nany who, in these comparatively quiet times, can be measured against\r\nthem, we are not thence to conclude that society, as a whole, has not\r\nadvanced; and that a policy which would have appeared dangerous to them,\r\nmay not be, at present, safe and reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdvantageous, therefore, as it may be, that the present federal party\r\nshould be perpetually on the watch against the encroachments of the\r\nstate governments,--useful as their incessant recurrence to the first\r\npractices, as well as principles, of the constitution may be,--it would\r\nbe for their comfort to remember, that the elasticity of their\r\ninstitutions is a perpetual safeguard; and, also, that the silent\r\ninfluence of the federal head of their republics has a sedative effect\r\nwhich its framers themselves did not anticipate. If they compare the\r\nfickleness and turbulence of very small republics,--Rhode Island, for\r\ninstance,--with the tranquillity of the largest, or of the confederated\r\nnumber, it is obvious that the existence of a federal head keeps down\r\nmore quarrels than ever appear.\r\n\r\nWhen the views of the present apprehensive federal party are closely\r\nlooked into, they appear to be inconsistent with one or more of the\r\nprimary principles of the constitution which we have stated. \"The\r\nmajority are right.\" Any fears of the majority are inconsistent with\r\nthis maxim, and were always felt by me to be so, from the time I entered\r\nthe country till I left it.\r\n\r\nOne sunny October morning I was taking a drive, with my party, along the\r\nshores of the pretty Owasco Lake, in New York state, and conversing on\r\nthe condition of the country with a gentleman who thought the political\r\nprospect less bright than the landscape. I had been less than three\r\nweeks in the country, and was in a state of something like awe at the\r\nprevalence of, not only external competence, but intellectual ability.\r\nThe striking effect upon a stranger of witnessing, for the first time,\r\nthe absence of poverty, of gross ignorance, of all servility, of all\r\ninsolence of manner, cannot be exaggerated in description. I had seen\r\nevery man in the towns an independent citizen; every man in the country\r\na land-owner. I had seen that the villages had their newspapers, the\r\nfactory girls their libraries. I had witnessed the controversies between\r\ncandidates for office on some difficult subjects, of which the people\r\nwere to be the judges. With all these things in my mind, and with every\r\nevidence of prosperity about me in the comfortable homesteads which\r\nevery turn in the road, and every reach of the lake, brought into view,\r\nI was thrown into a painful amazement by being told that the grand\r\nquestion of the time was \"whether the people should be encouraged to\r\ngovern themselves, or whether the wise should save them from\r\nthemselves.\" The confusion of inconsistencies was here so great as to\r\ndefy argument: the patronage among equals that was implied; the\r\nassumption as to who were the wise; and the conclusion that all the rest\r\nmust be foolish. This one sentence seemed to be the most extraordinary\r\ncombination that could proceed from the lips of a republican.\r\n\r\nThe expressions of fear vary according to the pursuits, or habits of\r\nmind of those who entertain them: but all are inconsistent with the\r\ntheory that the majority are right. One fears the influence in the\r\nnational councils of the \"Tartar population\" of the west, observing that\r\nmen retrograde in civilisation when thinly settled in a fruitful\r\ncountry. But the representatives from these regions will be few while\r\nthey are thinly settled, and will be in the minority when in the wrong.\r\nWhen these representatives become numerous, from the thick settlement of\r\nthose regions, their character will have ceased to become Tartar-like\r\nand formidable: even supposing that a Tartar-like character could\r\nco-exist with the commerce of the Mississippi. Another tells me that the\r\nState has been, again and again, \"on a lee shore, and a flaw has blown\r\nit off, and postponed the danger; but this cannot go on for ever.\" The\r\nfact here is true; and it would seem to lead to a directly contrary\r\ninference. \"The flaw\" is the will of the majority, which might be better\r\nindicated by a figure of something more stable. \"The majority is\r\nright.\" It has thus far preserved the safety of the state; and this is\r\nthe best ground for supposing that it will continue to be a safeguard.\r\n\r\nOne of the most painful apprehensions seems to be that the poorer will\r\nheavily tax the richer members of society; the rich being always a small\r\nclass. If it be true, as all parties appear to suppose, that rulers in\r\ngeneral are prone to use their power for selfish purposes, there remains\r\nthe alternative, whether the poor shall over-tax the rich, or whether\r\nthe rich shall over-tax the poor: and, if one of these evils were\r\nnecessary, few would doubt which would be the least. But the danger\r\nappears much diminished on the consideration that, in the country under\r\nour notice, there are not, nor are likely to be, the wide differences in\r\nproperty which exist in old countries. There is no class of hereditary\r\nrich or poor. Few are very wealthy; few are poor; and every man has a\r\nfair chance of being rich. No such unequal taxation has yet been\r\nordained by the sovereign people; nor does there appear to be any danger\r\nof it, while the total amount of taxation is so very small as in the\r\nUnited States, and the interest that every one has in the protection of\r\nproperty is so great. A friend in the South, while eulogizing to me the\r\nstate of society there, spoke with compassion of his northern fellow\r\ncitizens, who were exposed to the risks of \"a perpetual struggle between\r\npauperism and property.\" To which a northern friend replied, that it is\r\ntrue that there is a perpetual struggle everywhere between pauperism and\r\nproperty. The question is, which succeeds. In the United States, the\r\nprospect is that each will succeed. Paupers may obtain what they want,\r\nand proprietors will keep that which they have. As a mere matter of\r\nconvenience, it is shorter and easier to obtain property by enterprise\r\nand labour in the United States, than by pulling down the wealthy. Even\r\nthe most desponding do not consider the case as very urgent, at present.\r\nI asked one of my wealthy friends, who was predicting that in thirty\r\nyears his children would be living under a despotism, why he did not\r\nremove. \"Where,\" said he, with a countenance of perplexity, \"could I be\r\nbetter off?\"--which appeared to me a truly reasonable question.\r\n\r\nIn a country, the fundamental principle of whose politics is, that its\r\n\"rulers derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" it\r\nis clear that there can be no narrowing of the suffrage. However\r\nearnestly some may desire this, no one hopes it. But it does not follow\r\nthat the apprehensive minority has nothing left but discontent. The\r\nenlightenment of society remains not only matter for hope, but for\r\nachievement. The prudent speak of the benefits of education as a matter\r\nof policy, while the philanthropic promote it as a matter of justice.\r\nSecurity of person and property follows naturally upon a knowledge of\r\nrights. However the aristocracy of wealth, learning, and talent may\r\ndiffer among themselves, as to what is the most valuable kind of\r\nknowledge, all will agree that every kind will strengthen the bonds of\r\nsociety. In this direction must the aristocracy work for their own\r\nsecurity. If they sufficiently provide the means of knowledge to the\r\ncommunity, they may dismiss their fears, and rest assured that the great\r\ntheory of their government will bear any test; and that \"the majority\r\nwill be in the right.\"\r\n\r\nIf the fears of the aristocracy are inconsistent with the theory of the\r\ngovernment under which they live, so is much of the practice of the\r\ndemocracy. Their hopefulness is reasonable; their reliance on the\r\nmajority is reasonable. But there are evils attendant on their practice\r\nof their true theories which may account for the propounding of worse\r\ntheories by their opponents.\r\n\r\nLearning by experience is slow work. However sure it may be, it is slow;\r\nand great is the faith and patience required by men who are in advance\r\nof a nation on a point which they feel that they could carry, if they\r\nhad not to wait the pleasure of the majority. Though the majority be\r\nright in respect of the whole of politics, there is scarcely a sensible\r\nman who may not be more in the right than the majority with regard to\r\nsome one point; and no allowance can be too great for the perpetual\r\ndiscouragement hence arising. The majority eventually wills the best;\r\nbut, in the present imperfection of knowledge, the will is long in\r\nexhibiting itself; and the ultimate demonstration often crowns a series\r\nof mistakes and failures. From this fact arises the complaint of many\r\nfederalists that the democratic party is apt to adopt their measures,\r\nafter railing both at those measures, and at the men who framed them.\r\nThis is often true: and it is true that, if the people had only had the\r\nrequisite knowledge, they would have done wisely to have accepted good\r\nmeasures from the beginning, without any railing at all. But the\r\nknowledge was wanting. The next best thing that can happen is, that\r\nwhich does happen: that the people learn, and act upon their learning.\r\nIf they are not wise enough to adopt a good measure at first, it would\r\nbe no improvement of the case that they should be too obstinate to\r\naccept it at last. The case proves only that out of ignorance come\r\nknowledge, conviction, and action; and the majority is ultimately in the\r\nright. Whenever there is less of ignorance to begin with, there will be\r\nless of the railing, which is childish enough, whether as a mere\r\nimputation, or as a reality.\r\n\r\nThe great theory presumes that the majority not only will the best\r\nmeasures, but choose the best men. This is far from being true in\r\npractice. In no respect, perhaps, are the people more behind their\r\ntheory than in this. The noble set of public servants with which the\r\npeople were blessed in their revolutionary period seems to have inspired\r\nthem at first with a somewhat romantic faith in men who profess strong\r\nattachment to whatever has been erected into a glory of the nation; and,\r\nfrom that time to this, the federal party has, from causes which will be\r\nhereafter explained, furnished a far superior set of men to the public\r\nservice than the democratic party. I found this fact almost universally\r\nadmitted by the wisest adherents of democracy; and out of it has arisen\r\nthe mournful question, whether an honest man with false political\r\nprinciples be not more dangerous as a ruler than an unscrupulous man\r\nwith true political principles. I have heard the case put thus: \"There\r\nis not yet a sufficiency of real friends of the people willing to be\r\ntheir servants. They must take either a somewhat better set of men whose\r\npolitics they disapprove, or a somewhat worse set of men to make tools\r\nof. They take the tools, use them, and throw them away.\"\r\n\r\nThis is true; and a melancholy truth it is; since it is certain that\r\nwhenever the people shall pertinaciously require honest servants, and\r\ntake due pains to ascertain their honesty, true men will be forthcoming.\r\nUnder God's providence, the work never waits for the workman.\r\n\r\nThis fact, however, has one side as bright as the other is dark. It is\r\ncertain that many corrupt public servants are supported under the belief\r\nthat they are good and great men. No one can have attended assiduously\r\non the course of public affairs at Washington, and afterwards listened\r\nto conversation in the stages, without being convinced of this. As soon\r\nas the mistake is discovered, it is rectified. Retribution often comes\r\nsooner than it could have been looked for. Though it be long delayed,\r\nthe remedy is ultimately secure. Every corrupt faction breaks up, sooner\r\nor later, and character is revealed: the people let down their\r\nfavourite, to hide his head, or continue to show his face, as may best\r\nsuit his convenience; and forthwith choose a better man; or one believed\r\nto be better. In such cases, the evil lies in ignorance--a temporary\r\nevil; while the principle of rectification may work, for aught we can\r\nsee, eternally.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations,--one of fact, another of inference,--may reassure\r\nthose who are discouraged by these discrepancies between the theories of\r\nthe United States' government, and the practice of the democratic party,\r\nwith regard to both measures and men. The Americans are practically\r\nacquainted with the old proverb, \"What is every body's business is\r\nnobody's business.\" No man stirs first against an abuse which is no more\r\nhis than other people's. The abuse goes on till it begins to overbear\r\nlaw and liberty. Then the multitude arises, in the strength of the law,\r\nand crushes the abuse. Sufficient confirmation of this will occur to any\r\none who has known the State histories of the Union for the last twenty\r\nyears, and will not be wholly contradicted by the condition of certain\r\naffairs there which now present a bad aspect. Past experience sanctions\r\nthe hope that when these bad affairs have grown a little worse, they\r\nwill be suddenly and completely redressed. Illustrations in abundance\r\nare at hand.\r\n\r\nLotteries were formerly a great inducement to gaming in Massachusetts.\r\nPrudent fathers warned their sons against lotteries; employers warned\r\ntheir servants; clergymen warned their flocks. Tracts, denouncing\r\nlotteries, were circulated; much eloquence was expended,--not in vain,\r\nthough all sober people were already convinced, and weak people were\r\nstill unable to resist the seduction. At length, a young man drowned\r\nhimself. A disappointment in a lottery was found to be the cause. A\r\nthrill of horror ran through the community. Every man helped to carry\r\nhis horror of lotteries into the legislature; and their abolition\r\nfollowed in a trice.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry was once popular in the United States; and no one seemed to\r\nthink any harm of it, though, when examined, it clearly appears an\r\ninstitution incompatible with true republicanism. The account given of\r\nit by some friends of mine, formerly masons, is, that it is utterly\r\npuerile in itself; that it may be dignified, under a despotism, by an\r\napplication to foreign objects, but that it is purely mischievous in a\r\nrepublic. Its object, of course, is power. It can have no other; and\r\nought not to have this, where the making of the laws is the office of\r\nthe people. Its interior obligations are also violations of the\r\ndemocratic principle. All this was as true of masonry twelve years ago\r\nas it is now; but masonry was allowed to spread far and wide. One\r\nMorgan, a freemason, living in the western part of the state of New\r\nYork, did a remarkable deed, for which various motives are assigned. He\r\nwrote a book in exposure of masonry, its facts and tendencies. When the\r\nfirst part was printed and secured, some masons broke into the\r\nprinting-office where it was deposited, and destroyed as much of the\r\nwork as they could lay hold of. Being partly foiled, they bethought\r\nthemselves of stopping the work by carrying off the author. He was\r\narrested for a trifling debt, (probably fictitious,) conveyed hastily to\r\na magistrate, some miles off, who committed him for want of bail. The\r\nostensible creditor arrived at the jail, in the middle of the night,\r\nand let him out; four or five men put him into a carriage, which made\r\nfor the Canada frontier. On landing him on British ground, the masons\r\nthere refused to have any concern in a matter which had gone so far, and\r\nMorgan was shut up in the fort at Niagara village, where the Niagara\r\nriver flows into Lake Ontario. There he was fed and guarded for two\r\ndays. Thus far, the testimony is express; and concerning the succeeding\r\ncircumstances there is no reasonable doubt. He was put into a boat,\r\ncarried out into the middle of the river, and thrown in, with a stone\r\ntied to his neck. For four years, there were attempts to bring the\r\nconspirators to justice; but little was done. The lodges subscribed\r\nfunds to carry the actual murderers out of the country. Sheriffs,\r\njurymen, constables, all omitted their duty with regard to the rest. The\r\npeople were roused to action by finding the law thus overawed.\r\nAnti-masonic societies were formed. Massachusetts and other States\r\npassed laws against extra-judicial oaths. In such States, the lodges can\r\nmake no new members, and are becoming deserted by the old. The\r\nanti-masonic party flourishes, having a great principle as its basis. It\r\nhas the control in a few States, and powerful influence in others.\r\nMorgan's disclosures have been carried on by other hands. A bad\r\ninstitution is overthrown. The people have learned an important lesson;\r\nand they have gone through an honourable piece of discipline in making a\r\nstand for the law, which is the life of their body politic.\r\n\r\nThus end, and thus, we may trust, will end the mistakes of the people,\r\nwhose professed interest is in a wise self-government. Some worse\r\ninstitutions even than masonry remain to be cast out. The law has been\r\nagain overawed; not once, but many times; and the eyes of the world are\r\non the people of the United States, to see what they will do. The world\r\nis watching to discover whether they are still sensible of the sacred\r\nvalue of unviolated law; whether they are examining who it is that\r\nthreatens and overbears the law, and why; and whether they are\r\nproceeding towards the re-establishment of the peace and security of\r\ntheir whole community, by resolutely rooting out from among their\r\ninstitutions every one which will not bear the test of the first\r\nprinciples of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe other ground of hope of which I spoke as being inferential, arises\r\nout of the imaginative political character of the Americans. They have\r\nnot yet grown old in the ways of the world. Their immediate fathers have\r\ndone such a deed as the world never saw; and the children have not yet\r\npassed out the intoxication of success. With far less of vanity and\r\npresumption than might have been looked for from their youth among the\r\nnations, with an extraordinary amount of shrewdness and practical talent\r\nshared among individuals, the American people are as imaginative as any\r\nnation I happen to have heard or read of. They reminded me every day of\r\nthe Irish. The frank, confiding character of their private intercourses,\r\nthe generous nature of their mutual services, the quickness and\r\ndexterity of their doings, their fertility of resource, their proneness\r\nto be run away with by a notion, into any extreme of absurdity--in all\r\nthis, and in everything but their deficiency of moral independence, (for\r\nwhich a difference of circumstances will fully account,) they resemble\r\nthe Irish. I regard the American people as a great embryo poet: now\r\nmoody, now wild, but bringing out results of absolute good sense:\r\nrestless and wayward in action, but with deep peace at his heart:\r\nexulting that he has caught the true aspect of things past, and at the\r\ndepth of futurity which lies before him, wherein to create something so\r\nmagnificent as the world has scarcely begun to dream of. There is the\r\nstrongest hope of a nation that is capable of being possessed with an\r\nidea; and this kind of possession has been the peculiarity of the\r\nAmericans from their first day of national existence till now. Their\r\nfirst idea was loftier than some which have succeeded; but they have\r\nnever lost sight of the first. It remains to be, at intervals,\r\napprehended anew; and whenever the time shall arrive, which cannot but\r\narrive, when the nation shall be so fully possessed of the complete idea\r\nas by a moral necessity to act it out, they will be as far superior to\r\nnations which act upon the experience and expediency of their time as\r\nthe great poet is superior to common men.\r\n\r\nThis time is yet very far distant; and the American people have not only\r\nmuch to learn, and a painful discipline to endure, but some disgraceful\r\nfaults to repent of and amend. They must give a perpetual and earnest\r\nheed to one point; to cherish their high democratic hope, their faith in\r\nman. The older they grow, the more must they \"reverence the dreams of\r\ntheir youth.\" They must eschew the folly and profaneness so prevalent in\r\nthe old world, of exalting man, abstractedly and individually, as a\r\npiece of God's creation, and despising men in the mass. The statesman in\r\na London theatre feels his heart in a tumult, while a deep amen echoes\r\nthrough its chambers at Hamlet's adoration of humanity; but not the\r\nless, when he goes home, does he speak slightingly, compassionately, or\r\nprotectingly of the masses, the population, the canaille. He is\r\nawestruck with the grandeur of an individual spirit; but feels nothing\r\nof the grandeur of a congregated million of like spirits, because they\r\nhappen to be far off. This proves nothing but the short-sightedness of\r\nsuch a man. Such shortness of sight afflicts some of the wisest and best\r\nmen in the new world. I know of one who regards with a humble and\r\nreligious reverence the three or four spirits which have their\r\nhabitation under his roof, and close at hand; who begins to doubt and\r\nquestion, in the face of far stronger outward evidence of good, persons\r\nwho are a hundred miles off; and has scarcely any faith left for those\r\nwho happen to be over the sea. The true democratic hope cannot coexist\r\nwith such distrust. Its basis is the unmeasured scope of humanity; and\r\nits _rationale_ the truth, applicable alike to individuals and nations,\r\nthat men are what they are taken for granted to be. \"Countrymen,\" cries\r\nBrutus, dying,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"My heart doth joy that yet in all my life,\r\n     I found no man but he was true to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this fact is clear; it followed of course from Brutus\r\nalways supposing that men were true. Whenever the Americans, or any\r\nother people, shall make integrity their rule, their criterion, their\r\ninvariable supposition, the first principles of political philosophy\r\nwill be fairly acted out, and the high democratic hope will be its own\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Jefferson writes, September, 1798, \"The most long-sighted politician\r\ncould not, seven years ago, have imagined that the people of this wide\r\nextended country could have been enveloped in such delusion, and made so\r\nmuch afraid of themselves and their own power, as to surrender it\r\nspontaneously to those who are manoeuvring them into a form of\r\ngovernment, the principal branches of which may be beyond their\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, March, 1801:--\"You have understood that the revolutionary\r\nmovements in Europe had, by industry and artifice, been wrought into\r\nobjects of terror in this country, and had really involved a great\r\nportion of our well-meaning citizens in a panic which was perfectly\r\nunaccountable, and during the prevalence of which they were led to\r\nsupport measures the most insane. They are now pretty thoroughly\r\nrecovered from it, and sensible of the mischief which was done, and\r\npreparing to be done, had their minds continued a little longer under\r\nthat derangement. The recovery bids fair to be complete, and to\r\nobliterate entirely the line of party division, which had been so\r\nstrongly drawn.\"--_Jefferson's Correspondence_, vol. iii. pp. 401, 457.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n     \"The true foundation of republican government is the equal right of\r\n     every citizen, in his person and property, and in their management.\r\n     Try by this, as a tally, every provision of our constitution, and\r\n     see if it hangs directly on the will of the people.\"\r\n\r\n     _Jefferson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it be true that the principles of government are to be deduced\r\nmore from experience of human nature than experience of human\r\ngovernments, the institutions in which those principles are to be\r\nembodied must be infinitely modified by preceding circumstances. Bentham\r\nmust have forgotten this when he offered, at sixty-four, to codify for\r\nseveral of the United States, and also for Russia. He proposed to\r\nintroduce a new set of terms. These could not, from his want of local\r\nknowledge, have been very specific; and if general, what was society to\r\ndo till the lawyers had done arguing? How could even a Solomon\r\nlegislate, three thousand miles off, for a republic like that of\r\nConnecticut, which set out with taking its morals and politics by\r\nhandfuls, out of Numbers and Deuteronomy? or for Virginia, rank with\r\nfeudal prejudices and methods? or for Delaware, with its monarchical\r\nmartyr spirit? or for Louisiana, compounded of Spain, France, and\r\nAmerica? Though at the time of the framing of the constitution, the\r\nStates bore a strong general resemblance in their forms of government,\r\nendless minor differences existed, mainly arising from the different\r\ntenure on which they had been held under the English crown. Some had\r\nbeen provinces, governed by royal commissions, according to royal\r\nconvenience. These were New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, the\r\nCarolinas, and Georgia. Others had been under proprietary government; as\r\nMaryland, held under patent, by Lord Baltimore; and Pennsylvania and\r\nDelaware, held by William Penn. Others, again, were under charter\r\ngovernments; ruled and altogether disposed of by political corporations.\r\nSuch were Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Within the\r\nmemory of middle-aged men, the governor of New Hampshire used to travel\r\nin a coach and six, while the governor of the much more important\r\nMassachusetts went on a horse, with his wife on a pillion. It is within\r\nthe memory of living men how Massachusetts rose up in rejection of the\r\nimposition of a clergy by England; while the colonial law of Virginia\r\nordained parsons to be paid yearly six thousand weight of prime tobacco,\r\nin addition to marriage, burial, and birth-fees; in which days, an\r\nunholy pastor, appointed by Lord Baltimore, was seen to ride about with\r\nthe church key in one hand, and a pistol in the other. It is absurd to\r\nsuppose that communities, where wide differences of customs, prejudices,\r\nand manners still exist, can be, or ought to be, brought into a state of\r\nexact conformity of institutions. Diversities, not only of old custom,\r\nbut of climate, productions and genealogy, forbid it; and reason does\r\nnot require it. That institutions should harmonise with the same first\r\nprinciples, is all that is requisite. Some, who would not go so far as\r\nto offer to codify for countries where they have not get their foot,\r\nare yet apt to ask the use of one or another institution, to which the\r\nAmericans seem to be unreasonably attached. It is a sufficient general\r\nanswer that institutions are rarely sudden and complete inventions. They\r\nhave usually an historical origin, even when renovated by revolution.\r\nTheir protracted existence, and the attachment of the people to them are\r\nstrong presumptions of their having some use. If their purposes can be\r\nbetter attained in another way, they will surely be modified. If they\r\nare the result of compromise, they will be abolished, according to the\r\ninvariable law by which expediency finally succumbs to principle. That\r\nthis will be the fate of certain of the United States' institutions\r\nwhich no one yet dreams of touching, and few dare to analyze, has been\r\nclearly foreseen, for forty years past, by many of the most upright and\r\nable men in the country. Some of them entertain an agonizing alarm at\r\nthe prospect of change. Others, more reasonably, trust that, where no\r\nlarge pecuniary interests are at stake, the work of rectifying may very\r\nquietly and safely succeed that of reconciling: and the majority have no\r\nidea of the changes which their own hands, or their children's, will\r\nhave to effect. The gradual ripening for change may be an advantage in\r\nmore respects than one. Political changes which are the result of full\r\nconviction in a free people, are pretty sure to be safe. Time is also\r\nallowed, meanwhile, for men to practice their new lesson of separating\r\nthe idea of revolution from the horrors which have no more natural\r\nconnexion with it than burning at the stake has with the firm grasp of\r\nspeculative truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nConstitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the authority, and the objects of this celebrated\r\nconstitution, as set forth in its preamble.\r\n\r\nIts provisions are so well known that it is needful only to indicate\r\nthem. In Europe, the difficulty is to avoid supposing the state\r\ngovernments to be subordinate to the general. \"They are coordinate\r\ndepartments of one simple and integral whole.\" State government\r\nlegislates and administers in all affairs which concern its own\r\ncitizens. To the federal government are consigned all affairs which\r\nconcern citizens, as foreigners from other states, or as fellow-citizens\r\nwith all in certain specified relations.\r\n\r\nThe general objects of the instrument are easily stated; and an\r\napparently clear case of separation between the general and state\r\ngovernments drawn out upon paper. But the application of the instrument\r\nto practice is the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn this, there are two grand difficulties, among many of inferior\r\nimportance. The one is, to construe the instrument; the other is, to\r\nbridge over its awful chasms of compromise.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a solemn instrument drawn up yet without leaving\r\nroom for varieties of construction. There never can be, under our\r\npresent use of abstract terms; no two men's abstractions being alike, or\r\ndiscoverably so. Of course, the profession in this case is, that words\r\nare to be taken according to their just and natural import; that there\r\nis to be no straining; that they are to be judged of according to common\r\nsense; and so on. The old jests against etymologists are enough to prove\r\nhow far men are from agreeing what straining is. As to common sense, men\r\nrespond in unison to a revelation of it; but they rarely agree, _à\r\npriori_, as to what it is. This difficulty is a wholly unavoidable one.\r\nThe refuge under it is in the maxim \"the majority are right.\" If the\r\ncase in dispute be one of judicial import, the citizen may appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court. If it be of a different nature, it must be left to that\r\nother kind of supreme court,--the majority,--and the verdict will be\r\ngiven through the ballot-boxes.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty, that of compromise, is declared to have been\r\nequally unavoidable. Concession, large mutual concession, was clearly\r\nnecessary. To what extent, may be faintly conceived from the following\r\nextract from the Federalist. To some readers, who are more interested in\r\nthe present workings of the government, than in the embarrassments of\r\nits inventors, this extract may appear dull. But it is useful to be\r\npresented with an outline of the difficulties incurred in legislating\r\nfor a federal republic, both as a fact in political science; as a means\r\nof forming something like a just judgment of the framers of the\r\nconstitution; and as a ground of hope that, so much danger having been\r\nsurmounted, that which remains may be also overcome.\r\n\r\n\"This one tells us, that the proposed constitution ought to be\r\nrejected, because it is not a confederation of the States, but a\r\ngovernment over individuals. Another admits, that it ought to be a\r\ngovernment over individuals, to a certain extent, but by no means to the\r\nextent proposed. A third does not object to the government over\r\nindividuals, or to the extent proposed; but to the want of a Bill of\r\nRights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a Bill of Rights,\r\nbut contends that it ought to be declaratory, not of the personal rights\r\nof individuals, but of the rights reserved to the States in their\r\npolitical capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a Bill of Rights of any\r\nsort would be superfluous and misplaced; and that the plan would be\r\nunexceptionable, but for the fatal power of regulating the times and\r\nplaces of election. An objector in a large State exclaims loudly against\r\nthe unreasonable equality of representation in the senate. An objector\r\nin a small State is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. From one quarter, we are alarmed with the\r\namazing expense, from the number of persons who are to administer the\r\nnew government. From another quarter, and sometimes from the same\r\nquarter on another occasion, the cry is that the Congress will be but\r\nthe shadow of a representation; and that the government would be far\r\nless objectionable, if the number of the expenses were doubled. A\r\npatriot in a State that does not import or export, discerns insuperable\r\nobjections against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic\r\nadversary, in a State of great exports and imports, is not less\r\ndissatisfied that the whole burthen of taxes may be thrown on\r\nconsumption. This politician discovers in the constitution a direct and\r\nirresistible tendency to monarchy. That, is equally sure that it will\r\nend in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it\r\nwill ultimately assume, but sees clearly it must be one or other of\r\nthem. While a fourth is not wanting, who, with no less confidence,\r\naffirms, that the constitution is so far from having a bias towards\r\neither of these dangers, that the weight on that side will not be\r\nsufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite\r\npropensities. With another class of adversaries to the constitution, the\r\nlanguage is, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments\r\nare intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of\r\nregular government, and all the requisite precautions in favour of\r\nliberty. Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general\r\nexpressions, there are not a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each\r\none come forward with his particular explanation, and scarcely any two\r\nare exactly agreed on the subject. In the eyes of one, the junction of\r\nthe senate with the president, in the responsible function of appointing\r\nto offices, instead of vesting this power in the executive alone, is the\r\nvicious part of the organisation. To another, the exclusion of the House\r\nof Representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due security against\r\ncorruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power, is equally\r\nobnoxious. With a third, the admission of the president into any share\r\nof a power, which must ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of the\r\nexecutive magistrate, is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of\r\nrepublican jealousy. No part of the arrangement, according to some, is\r\nmore inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the Senate, which is\r\nalternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments,\r\nwhen this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department. We\r\nconcur fully, reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan;\r\nbut we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary\r\nauthority would be an amendment of the error: our principal dislike to\r\nthe organisation arises from the extensive powers already lodged in that\r\ndepartment. Even among the zealous patrons of a council of state, the\r\nmost irreconcilable variance is discovered, concerning the mode in which\r\nit ought to be constituted. The demand of one gentleman is, that the\r\ncouncil should consist of a small number, to be appointed by the most\r\nnumerous branch of the legislature. Another would prefer a larger\r\nnumber, and considers it a fundamental condition, that the appointment\r\nshould be made by the president himself.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt must have cost Mr. Madison some trouble to vary the mode of\r\nexpression in putting this host of objections. We cannot but admire the\r\ningenuity with which he has brought them into view. But what should we\r\nsay to the management which should reconcile the differences themselves?\r\nConcessions, various and large, were obviously necessary. I am not about\r\nto give a catalogue of what these actually were. They may be learned\r\nfrom any history of the period. Suffice it that the general and state\r\ngovernments not only urged and established claims, but admitted a set of\r\nprohibitions on themselves.\r\n\r\nIn all this there appears no fatal compromise. But there were some which\r\nmade the wisest men of the time tremble for the stability of their noble\r\nwork. There seems peril enough in the liability to the occurrence of new\r\nquestions, which could not be foreseen, and for which an opening might,\r\nor might not, happen to be left. When, in addition to such, there were\r\nsome questions left to be settled by a future government, from the\r\ninability of the statesmen of 1787 to agree upon them, these statesmen\r\nmight well be uneasy about the stability of their work. Of the first\r\norder of questions is that which is now debated with great\r\nanimosity,--whether Congress has power to abolish slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia: a disputed point of construction, on which it\r\nseems to me that no plain person can be blamed for not anticipating any\r\ndifference of opinion. Of the second class is that great question, or\r\nnest of questions, respecting Reserved Rights. It was agreed that all\r\nunforeseen questions which might arise with regard to the respective\r\npowers of the general and state governments, should be settled by the\r\nstate governments; but then, there was an indefinite limitation\r\nintroduced in the clause, that the general government should have all\r\npowers necessary for the prosecution of such and such purposes. This\r\nvague clause has been the occasion of the Union being shaken to its\r\ncentre; and it may be thus shaken again, before the questions arising\r\nout of it are all settled.\r\n\r\nEven these, being open questions, are less formidable than the\r\ncompromise of the true republican principle which is apparent in some\r\nprovisions of the constitution, and in some of the most important\r\ninstitutions of the country. The northern States, which had abolished,\r\non principle, a far milder slavery than that of the cotton and\r\nsugar-growing south, agreed to admit slavery in the south as a basis for\r\ndirect taxation, and for representation. They did worse. They agreed to\r\nact in behalf of their southern fellow-citizens in the capture and\r\nrestitution of runaway slaves, and in the defence of masters against\r\nrebellious slaves. What bitter sorrows of conscience and of feeling this\r\ncompromise has cost their children, it is impossible fully to describe.\r\nOf course, the law, being against conscience, _i. e._ the law of man\r\ncoming into collision with the law of God, is constantly broken; and\r\ncauses of dissension hence arise. I know that slavery is only recognised\r\nby the constitution as a matter of fact; and that it is only twice\r\nmentioned; in connexion with representation, and with the restitution to\r\ntheir masters of \"persons held to labour escaping into another State:\"\r\nbut the fact remains that a man who abhors slavery is compellable by the\r\nlaw which his fathers made, to deliver up to the owner a slave whose act\r\nof absconding he approves. It is impossible to estimate the evils which\r\nhave proceeded from, and which will yet arise out of this guilty but\r\n\"necessary\" compromise.\r\n\r\nThere was difficulty in bringing the greater and smaller States into\r\nunion. The smaller States could not agree to such an unequal\r\nrepresentation as should render them liable to be swallowed up by the\r\nlarger; while the larger could not consent to be reduced to an equality\r\nwith the smaller. The Senate was established to afford an equal state\r\nrepresentation; while the House of Representatives affords a fair\r\nrepresentation of the nation in the aggregate, according to numbers. But\r\nthe principle of the general government is, that it governs the entire\r\npeople as one nation, and not as a league of States. There ought, in\r\nconsistency with this, to be no state representation at all; and the\r\nSenate is an anomaly. An anomalous institution cannot be very\r\nlong-lived. A second chamber, on a more consistent principle, will\r\nprobably be established in its place, to fulfil its functions as a Court\r\nof Review, and as a check upon the precipitation of the other house,\r\nand, if need be, upon the encroachments of the executive. There is yet\r\nmore of compromise involved in this institution of the Senate; as might\r\nbe expected, since there is no end of compromise when principle is once\r\ndeparted from; yet there are statesmen who defend it on other grounds\r\nthan that its establishment was necessary to the foundation of any\r\nfederal government at all. One observed to me, \"Some things look well in\r\ntheory, and fail in practice. This may not be justifiable in theory; but\r\nit works well.\" If this last sentence be true, the well-working of the\r\nSenate is only a temporary affair; an accident. Its radical change\r\nbecomes a question of time merely; and the recent agitation of the\r\nquestion of Instructions seems to indicate that the time is not very far\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the judges for life is another departure from the\r\nabsolute republican principle. There is no actual control over them.\r\nTheirs is a virtually irresponsible office. Much can be and is said in\r\ndefence of this arrangement; and whatever is said, is most powerfully\r\nenforced by the weight of character possessed by the judiciary, up to\r\nthis day. But all this does not alter the fact that irresponsible\r\noffices are an inconsistency in a republic. With regard to all this\r\ncompromise, no plea of expediency can alter the fact that, while the\r\nHouse of Representatives is mainly republican, the Senate is only\r\npartially so, being anomalous in its character, and its members not\r\nbeing elected immediately by the people; and that the judiciary is not\r\nrepublican at all, since the judges are independent of the nation, from\r\nthe time of their appointment.\r\n\r\nI was told, on high authority, that the assent of the first nine States\r\nto the constitution, in 1788, was obtained by means not absolutely fair.\r\nWhat devices were used to procure an apparent majority, I was not\r\ninformed; but it is generally supposed that if there had been no\r\nlegislatures active on the occasion, if it had been put to the vote\r\nthroughout the nation, the ratification would not have taken place when\r\nit did. Chief Justice Marshall gives testimony to this effect in his\r\nLife of Washington. \"So small, in many instances, was the majority in\r\nfavour of the constitution, as to afford strong ground for the opinion\r\nthat, had the influence of character been removed, the intrinsic merits\r\nof the instrument would not have secured its adoption. Indeed, it is\r\nscarcely to be doubted that, in some of the adopting States, a majority\r\nof the people were in opposition.\"\r\n\r\nThat a constitution, so framed, and so carried, should have worked as\r\nwell as it has done, seems to point out two very encouraging things;\r\nthat we may, without rashness, speak of it as Washington did, when he\r\nsaid, \"I was convinced it approached nearer to perfection than any\r\ngovernment hitherto instituted among men;\" and that the world may\r\nquietly and hopefully await the further proceedings of the American\r\npeople, in their advances towards an uncompromising democracy. There\r\nwill be changes, but not therefore convulsion. There will be the change\r\nwhich Jefferson foresaw, and provided for without dread. \"Still,\" says\r\nhe, so lately as June, 1824, \"we consider our constitutions not\r\notherwise changeable than by the authority of the people, on a special\r\nelection of representatives for that very purpose: they are, until then,\r\nthe _lex legum_. But can they be made unchangeable? Can one generation\r\nbind another, and all others, in succession for ever? I think not. The\r\nCreator has made the earth for the living, not the dead.\"--\"A generation\r\nmay bind itself as long as its majority continues in life; when that has\r\ndisappeared, another majority is in place, holds all the rights and\r\npowers their predecessors once held, and may change their laws and\r\ninstitutions to suit themselves. Nothing then is unchangeable but the\r\ninherent and inalienable rights of man.\"[4]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more striking to a stranger than the experience gained,\r\nafter some residence in the United States, of the ultimate ascendency of\r\nthe will of the majority--_i. e._ of the right--in defiance of all\r\nappearances to the contrary. The review of what I witnessed of this\r\nkind, in the course of two years, with regard to the conduct of Congress\r\nalone, surprises and cheers me. It is true that I see several wrongs\r\nunredressed; several wounds inflicted on the people's liberties yet\r\nunhealed; but these are cases in which the people do not yet understand\r\nwhat has been done; or have not yet roused themselves to show that they\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, the people's right of petition is invaded. Last session,\r\nit was ordained that all petitions and memorials relating to a\r\nparticular subject--slavery in the District of Columbia--should be laid\r\non the table unread, and never recurred to. Of course, the people will\r\nnot long submit to this. What has been already achieved in Congress on\r\nthis topic is a security that the rest will follow. When I entered the\r\nUnited States, there was an absolute and most ominous silence in\r\nCongress about slavery. Almost every leading man there told me in\r\nconversation that it was the grand question of all; that every member's\r\nmind was full of it; that nearly all other questions were much affected,\r\nor wholly determined by it; yet no one even alluded to it in public.\r\nBefore I left, it had found its way into both houses. The houses had, in\r\nsome sort, come to a vote upon it, which showed the absolute abolition\r\nstrength in the House of Representatives to be forty-seven. The entering\r\nwedge having been thus far driven, it is inconceivable that the nation\r\nwill allow it to be withdrawn by surrendering their right of petition.\r\nWhen I left, however, the people had virtually no right of petition with\r\nregard to the District over which they--_i. e._ their Congress--have an\r\nexclusive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAgain. There were loud and extensive complaints, last session, of the\r\ndespotism of the chair in the House of Representatives, chiefly in\r\nconnexion with the subject of slavery. No members, it was said, were\r\nallowed a fair hearing but those who sat in a particular part of the\r\nhouse. If this complaint arises out of the peevishness of political\r\ndisappointment, it will soon be contradicted by facts. If it is true, it\r\nis a grave injury. In either case, the chair will not long possess this\r\npower of despotism. If the favoured are few, as the complaint states,\r\nthe injured many will demand and obtain the power to make themselves\r\nheard in turn; and no spirit of party can long stand in the way of a\r\nclaim so just.\r\n\r\nAgain. After the gentlemen of Charleston had disgraced their city and\r\ncountry, by breaking into the post-office, and burning the contents of\r\nthe mail-bags, in their dread of abolition papers, a post-master wrote\r\nto a member of the cabinet, desiring his approbation for having examined\r\nand refused to forward certain papers mailed at his office. The member\r\nof the cabinet, Kendall, gave the desired sanction to this audacious\r\nstoppage of the post-office function, declaring that the good of the\r\ncommunity (as judged of by the individual) is a consideration above the\r\nlaw. The strangers in the land knew not what to make of the\r\nfool-hardiness of hazarding such a declaration, in a man of Kendall's\r\nwit. It was known that he desired the office of post-master-general;\r\nthat the president wished him to have it, and that the doubt was whether\r\nthe Senate would confirm the appointment. Soon after this apparently\r\nfatal declaration, he was nominated, and the Senate confirmed his\r\nappointment. The declaration, no doubt, seated him in office. The\r\nsouthern members were won by it. Kendall calculated rightly for his\r\nimmediate object. What is to become of him when the people shall at\r\nlength recognise the peril and insult to themselves of one of their\r\nfavoured servants declaring the will of an individual to be occasionally\r\nsubversive of the law--_i. e._ of the will of the majority--remains to\r\nbe seen. Meantime, the continuance in office of the person whose\r\ndeclaration to the above effect remains unretracted, may be regarded as\r\none of the deepest wounds which has been inflicted on the liberties of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt, brought on, no doubt, by Kendall's success, to derange\r\nor stop the functions of the post-office, has failed. Mr. Calhoun's\r\nBill, commonly called the Gag Bill, prohibiting postmasters from\r\nreceiving and forwarding any papers whatsoever containing anything\r\nrelating to slavery, actually was brought to a third reading by the\r\ncasting vote of the president of the Senate. There was fear, at the\r\ntime, that this casting vote might ensure the success of the bill, from\r\nthe popularity of the vice-president. But the bill was thrown out on the\r\nthird reading; and the effect of the casting vote has been, not to aid\r\nthe bill, but to injure materially the popularity of the vice-president.\r\nThis is so far well. It shows that the people are preparing to grapple\r\nhonestly with the great, the hideous question, out of which arise these\r\nminor encroachments upon their liberties.\r\n\r\nOut of the slavery question arose the last monstrous usurpation of\r\nCongress, for which the emphatic rebuke of the nation awaits the sinning\r\nmembers. The story deserves to be told at length, on account both of its\r\npeculiarities, and of its furnishing a fair illustration of certain\r\nrelations between the state and general governments.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain was not very learned in the geography of the new world,\r\nin the early days of her colonies there. She gave Virginia a patent for\r\nlands, including what is now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\r\nMissouri, and on to the Pacific. Other colonies obtained grants of equal\r\nmoderation as to size, and wisdom as to disposition. This absurd\r\npartition, it was found, must occasion irreconcilable quarrels among the\r\nmembers of the confederation; and Washington proposed that all, after\r\nfixing their own boundaries, should throw into the common stock the huge\r\nunoccupied domain. Virginia led the way in making this honourable\r\nsacrifice. She fixed her own boundary; and the articles of compact\r\nbetween the United States and the people of the territory north-west of\r\nthe Ohio river, declared that the territory should be divided into not\r\nmore than five, nor less than three States. This was in 1787. The\r\nboundary prescribed for Ohio and Michigan, was found to be \"not\r\nconvenient.\" That is, Ohio found it so; and Michigan was not in a\r\nsituation, at the time when Ohio was admitted into the Union, to insist\r\nupon the ancient boundary, prescribed at the time of the cession of land\r\nby Virginia. When Ohio was made a State, the boundary she desired was,\r\namong other particulars, ratified by Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, another portion of land, lying within what Michigan supposed to\r\nbe her own territory, was taken from her, and added to Indiana, on the\r\nlatter being made a State. An equivalent is offered to Michigan in a\r\nportion of land, to be taken out of Wisconsin, on the western side of\r\nLake Michigan, which is the natural boundary of the territory. Michigan\r\nalleges that the inconvenience of a part of her territory lying on the\r\nother side of the lake would be so great, that the inhabitants would\r\nprefer belonging to Wisconsin; and the land would be ceded, as soon as\r\nWisconsin becomes a State. The decision of the right of this case is the\r\nproper business of the Supreme Court, whenever the contesting parties\r\nshall have all come into the Union. Meantime, all parties are interested\r\nin bearing down the claims of Michigan. Ohio and Indiana desire to keep\r\nthe lands Congress has authorised them to take. The slave States are\r\nanxious to hinder the increase in number of the free States; and by the\r\nordinance of 1787, slavery is prohibited for ever, north-west of the\r\nOhio. The slave States hope, by giving to Michigan a slice of Wisconsin,\r\nto make Wisconsin too small to be hereafter divided into two States. In\r\nthis object, the south will be foiled. Even if slavery should exist till\r\nWisconsin is ready for admission into the Union, there are two ways by\r\nwhich the desire of the south may and will be foiled. By the re-cession\r\nof the inconvenient portion by Michigan, as mentioned above; and by the\r\nwillingness of these northern States to make themselves smaller, and add\r\none to their number, as, by a _proviso_ in the original compact, they\r\nhave power to do, than let themselves be overborne by the south. This\r\npart of the contest, for \"a balance of power,\" arises altogether out of\r\nthe slavery question.\r\n\r\nSoon after I entered the country, Michigan became qualified to request\r\nadmission into the Union. She did so, declaring her discontent with the\r\nboundaries prescribed to her by Congress, and her intention to demand,\r\nin the Supreme Court, on her admission, the re-establishment of the old\r\nones. I was amused with the different views of the affair presented to\r\nme in different parts of the country. At Cincinnati, in June, 1835, I\r\nwas told that the President had just transmitted a threat to Ohio, that\r\nif she did not yield the boundary claimed by Michigan, he would send the\r\nUnited States troops to fight it out. It was added that the\r\nvice-president had thus far prevailed with the President; it being of\r\nimportance to Mr. Van Buren, that Michigan, which he considered in his\r\ninterest, should be admitted into the Union in time to vote for him in\r\nthe presidential election of 1836. There was much talk at Cincinnati of\r\nthe resources of Ohio. The people would turn out, to a man. The\r\nlegislature had instantly voted 300,000 dollars to raise troops; and one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men would immediately be in the field: while\r\nMichigan had neither men nor money;--had absolutely nothing to depend\r\nupon but the six thousand United States' soldiers. This seemed to me to\r\nbe too clear a case to be a very true one: and the event belied the\r\nstory in almost every particular. Michigan did raise men; (though there\r\nwas no war:) she had not the United States' troops: she is not in the\r\ninterest of Van Buren; and Ohio could bring no troops into the field.\r\n\r\nMichigan proceeded to organise her state government, and sent her\r\nsenators to Washington, during the session of 1835 and 1836. They were\r\nallowed to witness the proceedings, but not, of course, to vote. When I\r\narrived at Detroit, the capital of Michigan, in the middle of June,\r\n1836, the Governor told me that the Michiganians were in the singular\r\nposition of having a state government in full operation, while they were\r\nexcluded from the Union. The general opinion seemed to be that some\r\nconcession must be made about the boundary line; in which case, Michigan\r\nwould be admitted, in time to vote at the presidential election. I\r\npursued my travels through and around the Territory; and when I returned\r\nto Detroit, a month afterwards, I found the place in a state of high\r\nexcitement: an excitement fully warranted by the circumstances which had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nCongress had acknowledged Michigan to be a sovereign State; and had\r\noffered to admit her into the Union, on condition of her surrendering\r\nall claim to the disputed portions of territory.\r\n\r\nA grosser usurpation of power can hardly be conceived. Congress here\r\nusurped the function of the Supreme Court in passing sentence against\r\nMichigan: passing sentence, too, without hearing, or having a right to\r\nlisten to, evidence on the case. Congress here required of Michigan to\r\nlay down her rights on the threshold of the Union, if she meant to be\r\nadmitted. Mr. Adams intrepidly declared in the House of Representatives,\r\nthat Michigan had more cause to ply the Nullification doctrine than\r\nSouth Carolina ever had. A South Carolina nullifier declared in\r\nconversation, that he believed the Michiganians' claims to be just: but\r\nthat, sooner than give her the means of summoning another sovereign\r\nState before the Supreme Court, he would vote for her exclusion from the\r\nUnion as long as he lives. A strange posture of affairs, where all\r\njustice seemed to be set aside, and the constitution to have become a\r\ndead letter!\r\n\r\nThe anxiety next was to know what Michigan would do. There seemed too\r\nmany symptoms of yielding. It was mournful to those who felt that now\r\nwas the time, now the opportunity, so often sighed for in the best\r\nmoments of the best men, for making a heroic stand for the right, to\r\nhear the forebodings about the canal shares, the lake trade, the\r\nprobable pecuniary loss in various ways, if there should be delay in the\r\nadmission of Michigan into the Union. If we spoke of the constitution,\r\nwe were answered with the canal. If we spoke of patriotism, we were\r\nanswered with the surplus revenue--the share of it that would be lost.\r\nThen, there were fears of war. We were told that the alternative\r\nwas--admission, with its advantages, and a surrender of the contested\r\nlands; and exclusion, with war between infant Michigan and Ohio, backed\r\nby the United States. The alternative was rather, admission, with\r\nsubmission to unconstitutional force; or exclusion, with the lonely\r\nenjoyment of an honest sovereignty. But this was not the only\r\nalternative. Remaining out of the Union did not involve war. Michigan\r\nmight remain out of the Union, peaceably, and under protest, till the\r\npeople of the United States should become fully possessed of her case,\r\nand aroused to do her justice. It was with heartfelt delight that I\r\nfound, at length, that this last honest course is that which Michigan\r\nhas determined to pursue. It is so common for communities, as for\r\nindividuals, to miss the moment for doing the greatest of their deeds,\r\nto have the bright object of their preceding worship eclipsed at the\r\ncritical moment, to pray incessantly that they may be honest, and then\r\nstand aghast, after all, at an honest deed, that the meeting of the\r\nConvention which was to consider of this affair, was watched with deep\r\nanxiety by the friends of Michigan. We, their visitors, gathered hope\r\nfrom the tone of the Governor, and others with whom we conversed; from\r\nthe aspect of the legislators who were assembled to discuss the\r\nGovernor's message;--men with earnest and sensible faces, who looked as\r\nif they were aware that their liberties were at stake; and from the\r\nspirited conduct of Michigan from the beginning of the quarrel. Still,\r\nwe were doubtful whether the canal, the surplus revenue, and the\r\nprobable war, would not be too much for the fortitude of so young a\r\npeople. They have shamed our fears, and made a stand for constitutional\r\nliberty, which will secure to them the gratitude of the Union, to the\r\nlatest day of its existence. They have refused to enter the Union on the\r\nunconstitutional terms proposed. The people will see that they are\r\nhonourably admitted, and that Congress is duly rebuked.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\nThe principle which is professed in the appointment of a chief\r\nmagistrate in the United States is, that his removal is to be as easy as\r\npossible, and effected without disturbing for a moment the proceedings\r\nof government. Under the idea that this last must be impossible, some of\r\nthe patriots of 1789 were opposed to the institution of the office of\r\nPresident altogether; and there are now some who desire that the chief\r\nmagistrate should be, as nearly as possible, a cipher; that, for this\r\npurpose, his election should be annual; and that, if this cannot be, the\r\nterm should continue to be four years, but without renewal. Such declare\r\nthat the office was made for the man, Washington, who was wanted, to\r\nreconcile all parties. They maintain that, though it was, for a\r\nconsiderable time, well filled, it must become, sooner or later,\r\ndangerous to the public welfare: that it comprehends too much power for\r\na citizen of a republic to hold, presents too high a stake, occupies too\r\nmuch thought, and employs too much endeavour, to the exclusion of better\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nSome desire that the office should have a duration of six years, without\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\nNo one dreams of an attempt to hold the office for a third term; and\r\nthere is every prospect that, if any President should be ambitious\r\nenough to desire a second re-election, he would fail, and descend from\r\nhis high station with a total loss of honour.\r\n\r\nSome think so highly of the dignity of the chief magistracy, as to\r\npropose that ex-presidents should be debarred from holding lower\r\noffices. This looks too like an approximation to the monarchical\r\nprinciple to be, or to become, a popular way of viewing the subject. It\r\nis a proposition of the high federalists. I was far more gratified than\r\namused at seeing Mr. Adams daily in his seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, while the history of his administration was perpetually\r\nreferred to by those who discussed the politics of the country with me.\r\nI am aware that two interpretations may be put upon the fact of an\r\nex-president desiring a lower office. It may occur from a patriotism\r\nwhich finds its own dignity in the welfare of its country, or from a\r\nrestless ambition to be in the public eye. In either case, it seems to\r\nbe no matter for a fixed rule. The republican principle supposes every\r\nman to be at all times ready to serve his country, when called upon. The\r\nrest must be left to the character of the man, and the views of his\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nOthers think so much more highly of the dignity of the Senate than of\r\nthe executive, as to desire that senators should be ineligible for the\r\noffice of President. The object here is two-fold: to exalt the Senate;\r\nand, by making half a hundred offices higher in honour than that of\r\nPresident, to drain off some of the eager ambition which flows in the\r\ndirection of the executive function. But power is more alluring than\r\nhonour; and executive offices will always be objects of choice, in\r\npreference to legislative, except with a very small class of men.\r\nBesides, the Senate is already further removed from the control of the\r\npeople, than consistency with the true republican principle allows: and\r\nif the people are to be precluded from choosing their chief magistrate\r\nfrom among the fifty wisest men (as the senators are in theory) that the\r\nStates can choose for the guardianship of their interests, the dignity\r\nof both functions would be much lowered. In theory, the people's range\r\nof choice for their chief magistrate is to extend from the\r\nvice-president's chair to the humblest abode which nestles in the rocks\r\nof their eastern coasts, or overlooks the gulf of Mexico. The honour in\r\nwhich the Senate is held must depend on its preserving the character,\r\nwhich, on the whole, it has hitherto maintained. A nobler legislative\r\nbody, for power and principle, has probably never been known.\r\nConsidering the number of individuals of whom it is composed, its\r\ncharacter has, perhaps, been as remarkable as that of the noble array of\r\nPresidents, of which the United States have to boast. If, amidst its\r\nindirect mode of election, and long term of office, it should prove\r\nequally stable in principle, and flexible in its methods of progress, it\r\nmay yet enjoy a long term of existence, as honourable as could be\r\nsecured by any exclusion of its members from other offices in the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest apprehension connected with the President's office,\r\nrelates to the extent of his patronage. It was highly alarming, at\r\nfirst, to hear all that was said about the country being ridden with\r\nadministration-officers, and office-expectants. A little arithmetic,\r\nhowever, proved very cheering. The most eminent alarmist I happened to\r\nconverse with, stated the number of persons directly and indirectly\r\ninterested in the bestowment of office by the executive, to be 150,000.\r\nNo exact calculation can be made, since no one can do more than\r\nconjecture how many persons at a time are likely to be in expectation\r\nof any one office. But the above may be taken as the widest exaggeration\r\nwhich an honest alarmist can put forth. This class of interested persons\r\nis, after all, but a small section of the population. There is every\r\nreason to fear that official corruption is abundant under all\r\ngovernments; and, for some reasons which will be easily apprehended,\r\nremarkably so under the government of the United States; but, when it is\r\nconsidered how small a proportion of the people is, at any time,\r\ninterested in office, and how many persons in office are to be, in\r\nfairness, supposed honest, the evil of executive patronage diminishes to\r\nthe imagination so rapidly as to induce a suspicion that many who say\r\nthe most about it are throwing a tub to the whale. The watchfulness on\r\nthe executive power thus induced is a benefit which will set off against\r\na great amount of alarm. It will assist the people to find the true mean\r\nbetween their allowing the President too much power over the servants\r\nwho are to transact their business, and their assuming too much control\r\nover the servants who are to transact his.\r\n\r\nDifficult as it is to resist impressions on the spot, from all that is\r\nsaid about the power of the executive, and the character of the\r\nPresident of the time, the worst alarms are derided by the event. It\r\ndoes not appear as if the President could work any permanent effect upon\r\nthe mind and destiny of the nation. It is of great consequence to the\r\nmorals and prosperity of the season, that the chief magistrate should be\r\na man of principle, rather than expediency; a frank friend of the\r\npeople, rather than their cunning flatterer; a man of sense and temper,\r\nrather than an angry bigot; a man of business, rather than a blunderer.\r\nBut the term of an unworthy or incapable President is pretty sure to be\r\nthe shortest; and, if permitted to serve his eight years, he can do\r\nlittle unless he acts, on the whole, in accordance with the mind of the\r\npeople. If he has any power, it is because the people are with him: in\r\nwhich case, he cannot be very destructive to their interests. If he does\r\nnot proceed in accordance with public sentiment, he has no power. A\r\nbrief review of the course of the American Presidents seems to show that\r\ntheir influence subsides into something very weak and transitory; always\r\nexcepting that immeasurable and incalculable influence which is breathed\r\nforth through the remotest generations, by the personal character of\r\nconspicuous individuals.\r\n\r\nWashington's influence is a topic which no one is ever hardy enough to\r\napproach, in the way of measurement or specification. Within the compass\r\nof his name lies more than other words can tell of his power over men.\r\nWhen the British officers were passing up the Potomac, in the last war,\r\nto perpetrate as dastardly a deed of spoliation at the capital as ever\r\nit was the cruel fate of soldiers to be ordered to do, they desired to\r\nbe told when they were passing the burial place of Washington, and stood\r\nuncovered on deck as long as they were within sight of Mount Vernon. Any\r\nin England who happen to know how deeply disgraced their country was by\r\nthe actors in this expedition, will feel what the power must have been\r\nwhich, breathing from that shore, humanised for the hour the cowardly\r\nplunderers as they floated by. But it was Washington, the man, not the\r\nPresident, who moved them to uncover their heads. It is Washington, the\r\nman, not the President, whose name is lovingly spoken, whose picture\r\nsmiles benignly in every inhabited nook of his own congregation of\r\nrepublics. It is even Washington, the man, not the President, whose name\r\nis sacred above all others, to men of all political parties. It was\r\nWashington, the man, who united the votes of all parties in his\r\npresidentship, since, so far from pretending to agree with all, he took\r\nand left, without fear or favour, what convictions he could or could not\r\nadopt from each. The one impression which remains of his presidentship\r\nis its accordance with himself. Had it been, in any respect, a lower\r\nself, there would have been little left of Washington in the people now.\r\n\r\nAdams came in by the strength of the federal party. Supported by the\r\nslave States, and all the federalism of the north, he had the means, if\r\nany President ever had, of leaving a strong and permanent impression on\r\nthe face of affairs. He filled up his offices with federalists.\r\nEverything during his term of office favoured the influence of the\r\nfederalists. The nation was almost beside itself with panic at the\r\npolitical convulsions of Europe. Yet, notwithstanding all this, and Mr.\r\nAdams's great weight of character, giving influence to his partialities,\r\nthe people revealed themselves, in the choice of his successor,\r\nstaunchly republican.\r\n\r\nJefferson's influence was greater than that of any other President,\r\nexcept Washington; and the reason is, that his convictions went along\r\nwith the national mind. If Jefferson, with the same love of the people,\r\nthe same earnestness of temper, and grace of manners, had been in any\r\nconsiderable degree less democratic, he might have gone creditably\r\nthrough his term, and have been well spoken of now; but he would not\r\nhave been the honourable means of two successors of the same principles\r\nwith himself, being brought in; nor would he have lain, as he now does,\r\nat the very heart of the people. At the outset, his state-rights\r\nprinciple secured him the south, and his philanthropic, democratic\r\nprinciples, the north. He was popular, almost beyond example. His\r\npopularity could scarcely be increased; but it has never declined. The\r\ncommon charges against him, of irreligion, of oppression in the\r\nmanagement of his patronage, of disrespect to his predecessors, are\r\nfalling into oblivion, while his great acts remain. As to his religion,\r\nwhatever might be his creed, its errors or deficiencies, these are still\r\nmatters of disagreement among the wise and good; and it is certain that\r\nJefferson viewed all the realities that came within his ken, with that\r\ncalm earnestness which is the true religious spirit. As to the removals\r\nfrom office, which are still complained of, it should be remembered that\r\nhis predecessor had filled as many offices as possible with high\r\nfederalists, many of whom provoked their own discharge by their activity\r\nagainst the government they professed to serve. There is no evidence\r\nthat Jefferson went beyond his own principle; and a principle is no\r\nmatter of reproach, though it may be of controversy. He says, \"Mr.\r\nAdams's last appointment, when he knew he was naming counsellors and\r\naids for me and not for himself, I shall set aside as far as depends on\r\nme. Officers who have been guilty of gross abuses of office, such as\r\nmarshals packing juries, &c., I shall now remove, as my predecessor\r\nought in justice to have done. The instances will be few, and governed\r\nby strict rule, and not party passion. The right of opinion shall suffer\r\nno invasion from me.\"--\"The remonstrance laments that a change in the\r\nadministration must produce a change in the subordinate officers; in\r\nother words, that it should be deemed necessary for all officers to\r\nthink with their principal. But on whom does this imputation bear? On\r\nthose who have excluded from office every shade of opinion which was not\r\ntheir's? or on those who have been so excluded? I lament sincerely that\r\nunessential differences of opinion should ever have been deemed\r\nsufficient to interdict half the society from the rights and blessings\r\nof self-government, to proscribe them as unworthy of every trust. It\r\nwould have been to me a circumstance of great relief, had I found a\r\nmoderate participation of office in the hands of the majority. I would\r\ngladly have left to time and accident to raise them to their just share.\r\nBut their total exclusion calls for prompter corrections. I shall\r\ncorrect the procedure: but, that done, return with joy to that state of\r\nthings, when the only questions concerning a candidate shall be, Is he\r\nhonest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the constitution?\"[5]\r\n\r\nAs to his disrespect to Washington and Adams, it should be remembered\r\nwhat the party heats of the day were; how Washington's cabinet was\r\ndivided between France, war, and general liberty; and neutrality, peace,\r\nand care of the people at home. With such a theme of quarrel, it would\r\nhave been a wonder if hasty words had not been sometimes spoken on all\r\nsides. Jefferson's ultimate opinion of Washington, written in confidence\r\nto a friend, in 1814, has happily come to light. At the close, he says,\r\n\"These are my opinions of General Washington, which I would vouch at the\r\njudgment-seat of God, having been formed on an acquaintance of thirty\r\nyears.\" One extract is enough: \"On the whole, his character was, in its\r\nmass, perfect; in nothing bad, in few things indifferent; and it may\r\ntruly be said, that never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly\r\nto make a man great, and to place him in the same constellation with\r\nwhatever worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance.\"[6]\r\nThe friendship in old age between himself and Mr. Adams, and the moral\r\nand intellectual beauty of their close correspondence, are a spectacle\r\nin sight of which all prior party misunderstandings should be forgotten.\r\nThere is one infallible test by which to try old men who have had much\r\nto do in the world. If their power and privilege of admiration survive\r\ntheir knowledge of the world, they are true-hearted; and they occasion\r\nas much admiration as they enjoy. Jefferson stands this test.\r\n\r\nHis great acts are much heard of. The reduction of taxes and correction\r\nof abuses with which he began his administration; his having actually\r\ndone something against slavery; his invariable decision for advocacy or\r\nopposition, in accordance with the true democratic principle, are now\r\nspoken of more frequently than things less worthy to be remembered. His\r\ninfluence has been greater than that of any other President since\r\nWashington, exactly in proportion to his nearer approach to the national\r\nidea of a chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nNo great change took place during the administration of his two\r\nsuccessors, Madison and Monroe. They were strong in the strength of his\r\nprinciples, and of their own characters. Madison's term of office would\r\nhave been memorable in history, if he had not immediately followed his\r\nfriend Jefferson. Their identity of views, put into practice by Madison,\r\nwith the simplest honesty and true modesty, caused less observation than\r\nthe same conduct immediately succeeding a federal administration would\r\nhave done. Hence the affectation, practised by some, of calling Madison\r\na tool of Jefferson. Those who really knew Mr. Madison and his public\r\nlife, will be amused at the idea of his being anybody's tool.\r\n\r\nThe reason why John Quincy Adams's administration is little notorious is\r\nsomewhat of the same nature. He was a pure President; a strictly moral\r\nman. His good morality was shown in the devotion of his fine powers to\r\nthe faithful conduct of evanescent circumstances. His lot was that of\r\nall good Presidents in the quiet days of the republic. He would not use\r\nhis small power for harm; and possessed no very great power for\r\npolitical good.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was brought into office by an overpowering majority, and\r\nafter a series of strong party excitements. If ever there was a\r\npossibility of a President marking his age, for good or for evil, it\r\nwould have been done during Jackson's administration. He is a man made\r\nto impress a very distinct idea of himself on all minds. He has great\r\npersonal courage, much sagacity, though frequently impaired by the\r\nstrength of his prejudices, violent passions, an indomitable will, and\r\nthat devotion to public affairs in which no President has ever failed.\r\nHe had done deeds of war which flattered the pride of the people; and in\r\ndoing them, he had acquired a knowledge of the people, which has served\r\nhim instead of much other knowledge in which he is deficient. He has\r\nknown, however, how to obtain the use, though not the reputation, of the\r\nknowledge which he does not possess. Notwithstanding the strength of his\r\npassions, and the awkward positions in which he has placed himself by\r\nthe indulgence of his private resentments, his sagacity has served him\r\nwell in keeping him a little way a-head of the popular convictions. No\r\nphysician in the world ever understood feeling the pulse, and ordering\r\nhis practice accordingly, better than President Jackson. Here are all\r\nthe requisites for success in a tyrannical administration. Even in\r\nEngland, we heard rumours in 1828, and again in 1832, about the perils\r\nof the United States, under the rule of a despotic soldier. The cry\r\nrevived with every one of his high-handed deeds; with every exercise of\r\nthe veto,--which he has used oftener than all the other Presidents put\r\ntogether,--with every appointment made in defiance of the Senate; with\r\nthe removal of the deposites; with his messages of menace to the French\r\ngovernment. Yet to what amounts the power now, at the close of his\r\nadministration, of this idol of the people, this man strong in war, and\r\nsubtle in council, this soldier and statesman of indomitable will, of\r\ninsatiable ambition, with the resources of a huge majority at his\r\ndisposal? The deeds of his administration remain to be justified in as\r\nfar as they are sound, and undone if they are faulty. Meantime, he has\r\nbeen able to obtain only the barest majority in the Senate, the great\r\nobject of his wrath: he has been unable to keep the slavery question out\r\nof Congress,--the introduction of which is by far the most remarkable\r\nevent of his administration. One of the most desponding complaints I\r\nheard of his administration was, not that he had strengthened the\r\ngeneral government--not that his government had tended to\r\ncentralisation--not that he had settled any matters to his own\r\nsatisfaction, and left the people to reconcile themselves to his\r\npleasure as they best might,--but that every great question is left\r\nunsettled; that it is difficult now to tell any party by its principles;\r\nthat the principles of such affairs as the currency, land, slavery,\r\ninternal improvements, &c. remain to be all argued over again.\r\nDoubtless, this will be tiresome to such public men as have entirely and\r\nfinally made up their minds on these subjects. To such, nothing can well\r\nbe more wearisome than discussion and action, renewed from year to year.\r\nBut the very fact that these affairs remain unsettled, that the people\r\nremain unsatisfied about them, proves that the people have more to\r\nlearn, and that they mean to learn it. No true friend of his country\r\nwould wish that the questions of slavery and currency should remain in\r\nany position that they have ever yet occupied in the United States; and\r\ntowards the settlement of the latter of the two, as far as light depends\r\non collision of opinions, it is certain that no man has done so much,\r\nwhether he meant it or not, as President Jackson. The occasional\r\nbreaking up and mingling of parties is a necessary circumstance, whether\r\nit be considered an evil or a good. It may be an evil, in as far as it\r\naffords a vantage-ground to unprincipled adventurers; it is a good, in\r\nas far as it leads to mutual understanding, and improves the candour of\r\npartisans. For the rest, there is no fear but that parties will soon\r\ndraw asunder, with each a set of distinctive principles as its badge.\r\nMeantime, men will have reason to smile at their fears of the formidable\r\npersonage, who is now descending from the presidential chair; and their\r\nenthusiasm will have cooled down to the temperature fixed by what the\r\nevent will prove to have been his merits. They will discuss him by their\r\nfiresides with the calmness with which men speak of things that are\r\npast; while they keep their hopes and fears to be chafed up at public\r\nmeetings, while the orator points to some rising star, or to some cloud\r\nno bigger than a man's hand. Irish emigrants occasionally fight out the\r\nbattle of the Boyne in the streets of Philadelphia; but native Americans\r\nbestow their apprehensions and their wrath upon things future; and their\r\nphilosophy upon things past. While they do this, it will not be in the\r\npower of any President to harm them much or long.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nSTATE GOVERNMENTS.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, did statesmen begin their task of constitution-making\r\nwith so much aid from preceding circumstances as the great men of the\r\nRevolution. A social neighbourhood of colonies, all suffering under\r\ncolonial grievances, and all varying in their internal government,\r\nafforded a broad hint of the present system, and fine facilities for\r\nputting it in practice. There was much less speculation in the case than\r\nmight appear from a distance; and this fact so far takes away from the\r\nsuperhuman character of the wisdom which achieved the completion of the\r\nUnited States' constitution, as to bring the mind down from its state of\r\namazement into one of very wholesome admiration.\r\n\r\nThe state governments are the conservative power, enabling the will of\r\nthe majority to act with freedom and convenience. Though the nation is\r\nbut an aggregation of individuals, as regards the general government,\r\ntheir division into States, for the management of their domestic\r\naffairs, precludes a vast amount of confusion and discord. Their mutual\r\nvigilance is also a great advantage to their interests, both within each\r\nState, and abroad. No tyrant, or tyrannical party, can remain unwatched\r\nand unchecked. There is, in each State, a people ready for information\r\nand complaint, when necessary; a legislature ready for deliberation; and\r\nan executive ready to act. Many States, in other ages and regions, have\r\nbeen lost through the necessity of creating their instruments when they\r\nshould have been acting. State organisation is never managed without\r\ndispute; and it makes the entire difference in the success of resistance\r\nto aggression whether the necessary apparatus has to be created in haste\r\nand confusion, or whether everything is in readiness for executing the\r\nwill of the majority.\r\n\r\nUnder no other arrangement, perhaps, could the advantage be secured of\r\nevery man being, in his turn, a servant of the commonwealth. If the\r\ngeneral government managed everything, the public service would soon\r\nbecome the privilege of a certain class, or a number of classes of men;\r\nas is seen to be the case elsewhere. The relation and gradation of\r\nservice which are now so remarkable a feature in the United States\r\ncommonwealth, could never then happen naturally, as they now do. Almost\r\nevery man serves in his township in New England, and in the\r\ncorresponding ward or section elsewhere; and has his capability tried;\r\nand, if worthy, he serves his county, his State, and finally the Union,\r\nin Congress. Such is the theory: and if not followed up well in\r\npractice, if some of the best men never get beyond serving their\r\ntownship, and some of the worst now and then get into Congress, the\r\npeople are unquestionably better served than if the selection of\r\nservants depended on accident, or the favour of men in power. Whatever\r\nextraneous impediments may interfere with the true working of the\r\ntheory, every citizen feels, or ought to feel, what a glorious career\r\nmay lie before him. In his country, every road to success is open to\r\nall. There are no artificial disqualifications which may not be\r\nsurmounted. All _humbug_, whether of fashion and show, of\r\nsanctimoniousness, of licentiousness, or of anything else, is there\r\ndestined to speedy failure and retribution. There is no hereditary\r\nhumbug in the United States. If the honest, wise man, feels himself\r\ndepressed below the knave, he has, if he did but know it, only to wait\r\npatiently a little while, and he will have his due. Though truth is\r\nequally great everywhere, and equally sure ultimately to prevail, men of\r\nother countries have often to wait till they reach the better country\r\nthan all, before they witness this ultimate prevalence, except with the\r\neye of faith. The young nation over the Atlantic, is indulged, for the\r\nencouragement, with a speedier retribution for her well or ill doings;\r\nand almost every one of her citizens, if he be truly honourable, may\r\ntrust to be fitly honoured before he dies.\r\n\r\nAnother conservative effect of the state governments is the facilities\r\nthey afford for the correction of solecisms, the renovation of\r\ninstitutions as they are outgrown, and the amendment of all unsuitable\r\narrangements. If anything wants to be rectified in any State, it can be\r\ndone on the mere will of the people concerned. There is no imploring of\r\nan uninterested government at a distance--a government so occupied with\r\nits foreign relations as to have little attention to spare for domestic\r\ngrievances which it does not feel. There is no waiting any body's\r\npleasure; nobody's leave to ask. The remedy is so close at hand, those\r\nwho are to give it are so nearly concerned, that it may always, and, for\r\nthe most part, speedily, be obtained, upon good cause being shown. No\r\nexternal observance is needed, except of the few and express\r\nprohibitions which the general and state governments have interchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to look over the proceedings of the state legislatures for\r\nany one year. Maine amends her libel law, decreeing that proof of truth\r\nshall be admitted as justification. Massachusetts decrees a revision and\r\nconsolidation of her laws, and the annihilation of lotteries. Rhode\r\nIsland improves her quarantine regulations. Connecticut passes an act\r\nfor the preservation of corn-fields from crows. Vermont decrees the\r\nprotection of the dead in their graves. New York prohibits the\r\nimportation of foreign convicts. New Jersey incorporates a dairy\r\ncompany. Pennsylvania mitigates the law which authorises imprisonment\r\nfor debt. Maryland authorises a geological survey. Georgia enlarges her\r\nlaw of divorce. Alabama puts children, in certain circumstances, under\r\nthe protection of chancery. Mississippi decrees a census. Tennessee\r\ninterdicts barbacues in the neighbourhood of camp meetings. Ohio\r\nregulates the care of escheated lands. Indiana prohibits a higher rate\r\nof interest than ten percent. Missouri authorises the conveyance of real\r\nestate by married women. And so on. It seems difficult to imagine how\r\nmany abuses can reach an extreme, or be tardy of cure, where the will of\r\nthe majority is not only speedily made known, but where the division of\r\nemployment is so skilfully arranged that the majority may be trusted to\r\nunderstand the case on which they are to decide.\r\n\r\nIt has always appeared to me that much misapprehension is occasioned by\r\nits being supposed that the strength of the general government lies in\r\nthe number of its functions; and its weakness in the extent of its area.\r\nTo me it appears directly the reverse. A government which has the\r\nmanagement of all the concerns of a people, the greater and the smaller,\r\npreserves its stability by the general interest in its more important\r\nfunctions. If you desire to weaken it, you must withdraw from its\r\nguardianship the more general and important of its affairs. If you\r\ndesire to shield it from cavil and attack, you must put the more local\r\nand partial objects of its administration under other management. If the\r\ngeneral government of the United States had to manage all legislation\r\nand administration within their boundaries, it could hardly hold\r\ntogether one year. If it had only one function, essential to all, and\r\nimpossible to be otherwise fulfilled, there seems no reason why it\r\nshould not work prosperously till there are fifty States around it, and\r\nlonger. The importance of the functions of the general government\r\ndepends partly upon the universality of the interest in them; and partly\r\nupon the numbers included under them. So far, therefore, from the\r\nenlargement of the area of the United States being perilous to the\r\ngeneral government, by making it \"cumbrous,\" as many fear, it seems to\r\nme likely to work a directly contrary effect. There are strong reasons\r\nwhy an extension of her area would be injurious to her, but I cannot\r\nregard this as one. A government which has to keep watch over the\r\ndefence, foreign policy, commerce, and currency, of from twenty-five to\r\nfifty small republics, is safer in the guardianship of its subjects than\r\nif it had to manage these same affairs for one large republic, with the\r\nadditional superintendence of its debtors, its libellers, and the crows\r\nof its corn-fields.\r\n\r\nLittle or no room for rebellion seems to be left under the constitution\r\nof the United States. In the progress of human affairs, familiar evils\r\nexpire with worn-out institutions, and new dangers arise out of the\r\nmidst of renovated arrangements. Assassinations are the form which\r\nresistance to government assumes in pure despotisms. Rebellion is the\r\nname it bears under governments somewhat more liberal. In the United\r\nStates, nothing worse than professed Nullification has yet been heard\r\nof--unless Colonel Burr's secret schemes were indeed treasonable. A\r\nbrief account of the South Carolina Nullification may exhibit the\r\nrelations, and occasional enmities of the general and states government\r\nin a clearer way than could be done, otherwise than by a narrative of\r\nfacts. This little history shows, among many other things, that America\r\nfollows the rest of the world in quoting the constitution as a sanction\r\nof the most opposite designs and proceedings: what different sympathies\r\nrespond to the word \"patriotism;\" and of how little avail is the letter\r\nof the constitution, when there is variance as to its spirit.\r\n\r\nGeorgia laid claim, some years ago, to the Cherokee territory, on the\r\nground that the United States had no right to make the laws and treaties\r\nby which the Cherokees were protected; that such legislation was\r\ninconsistent with the reserved rights of the sovereign state of Georgia.\r\nGeorgia thus acted upon the supposition, that she was to construe the\r\nfederal compact in her own way, and proceed according to her own\r\nconstruction. Congress checked her in this assumption, and rejected her\r\npretensions by an almost unanimous vote. Soon after the accession of\r\nGeneral Jackson to the presidentship, Georgia, either presuming upon his\r\nfavour, or wishing to test his dispositions, began to encroach upon the\r\nCherokee lands. The Cherokees appealed to the federal government for\r\nprotection, under the laws and treaties framed for that very purpose.\r\nThe President replied, that Georgia was right in annulling those laws\r\nand treaties, and that the executive could not interfere. The Indian\r\ncause was brought before the Supreme Court. There was difficulty about\r\nthe character in which the plaintiffs were to sue, and as to whether\r\nthey could sue at all, under that provision of the constitution which\r\nauthorises _foreign nations_ to demand justice from the federal\r\ntribunals. The court expressed a strong, opinion however, that the\r\nCherokees were entitled to protection from the Executive.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court and Georgia were thus brought into opposition, while\r\nthe Executive took the part of Georgia. Compassion for the Cherokees was\r\nnow swallowed up in anxiety about the decision of the question of state\r\nrights. The Executive had, as yet, only negatively declared himself,\r\nhowever; and the Supreme Court had not been driven on to deliver a\r\nverdict against the Georgian laws, by which the Cherokees were\r\noppressed. The topic of the right of a State to annul the laws and\r\ntreaties of the federal government was meantime generally discussed; and\r\nreconsideration was forced upon the President.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina presently followed the example of Georgia. She annulled\r\nthe acts of Congress, which regarded such revenue laws as she considered\r\ncontrary to general principles, and to her own interests. The President\r\nnow perceived that if every State proceeded to nullify the acts of\r\nCongress, upon its own construction of the federal constitution, the\r\ngeneral government could not be secure of its existence for a day. While\r\nthe Executive was still in a position of observation, the Supreme Court\r\npronounced, in another case, a verdict against the unconstitutional laws\r\nof Georgia. In 1829, the legislature of Virginia asserted the right of\r\neach State to construe the federal constitution for itself: and thus\r\nthere appeared to be three States already in the course of withdrawing\r\nfrom the Union.\r\n\r\nCongress went on legislating about the tariff, without regard to this\r\nopposition; and the protests of certain States against their proceedings\r\nwere quietly laid on the table, as impertinences. The South Carolina\r\nadvocates of Nullification worked diligently in their own State to ripen\r\nthe people sufficiently to obtain a convention which should proclaim\r\ntheir doctrine as the will of the State: in which case, they doubted\r\nnot that they should secure the countenance and co-operation of most or\r\nall of the southern States. A convention in favour of free trade met at\r\nPhiladelphia; another in favour of the tariff met at New York; and the\r\nnullifiers saw reason to turn the discussion of the quarrel as much as\r\npossible from the principle of Nullification to the principle of free\r\ntrade. They perceived the strength of the latter ground, whether or not\r\nthey saw the weakness of the former; and by their skilful movement upon\r\nit, they eventually caused a greater benefit to the nation, than their\r\ndiscontent did harm to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe President was invited to dine at Charleston on the 4th of July,\r\n1831; and in his answer, he thought fit to announce that he should do\r\nhis duty in case of any attempt to annul the laws of the Union. This was\r\na virtual retractation of his encouragement to Georgia. A committee of\r\nthe legislature of South Carolina reported the letter to be at variance\r\nwith the duties of the President, and the rights of the States. The heat\r\nwas rising rapidly. The nullifiers were loud in their threats, and\r\nwatchful in observing the effect of those threats abroad. North Carolina\r\nrepudiated the whole doctrine of Nullification: other neighbouring\r\nStates showed a reluctance to sanction it. The President's next message\r\nrecommended a modification of the tariff, which was known to be no\r\nfavorite of his; but the modification he proposed had no other bearing\r\nthan upon the amount of the revenue.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of Congress of 1832, various alterations were made in\r\nthe duties, which it was hoped would be to the satisfaction of South\r\nCarolina: but the complaint of her representatives was, that the\r\nreductions which were ordained were on those articles in which she had\r\nno interest; while her burdens were actually increased. These\r\nrepresentatives met at Washington, and drew up an address to the people\r\nof South Carolina, in which they declared their wrongs, and inquired\r\nwhether they were to be tamely submitted to.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of South Carolina, after the next election, exhibited a\r\nlarge majority in both houses in favour of Nullification. A convention\r\nwas called at Columbia, in consequence of whose proceedings an ordinance\r\nwas prepared, and speedily passed through the legislature, declaring all\r\nthe acts of Congress imposing duties on imported goods, to be null and\r\nvoid within the state of South Carolina. It prohibited the levying of\r\nall such duties within the State, and all appeals on the subject to the\r\nSupreme Court. A number of minor provisions were made to hinder the levy\r\nof import duties. The governor was empowered to call the militia into\r\nservice against any opposition which might be made by the general\r\ngovernment to this bold mode of proceeding. The entire military force of\r\nthe State, and the services of volunteers, were also placed at his\r\ndisposal. Arms and ammunition were ordered to be purchased.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the President's anxiety about consistency. He\r\nordered all the disposable military force to assemble at Charleston;\r\nsent a sloop of war to that port, to protect the federal officers in the\r\ndischarge of their duties; and issued a vigorous proclamation, stating\r\nthe constitutional doctrine, about the mutual relations of the general\r\nand state governments, and exhorting the citizens of South Carolina not\r\nto forfeit their allegiance. Governor Hayne issued a counter\r\nproclamation, warning the citizens of the State against being seduced\r\nfrom their state allegiance by the President. This was at the close of\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nEverything being thus ready for an explosion, South Carolina, appeared\r\nwilling to wait the result of another session. This was needful enough;\r\nfor she was as yet uncertain whether she was to have the assistance of\r\nany of her sister States. Mr. Calhoun, the vice-president, resigned his\r\noffice, and became a senator in the room of governor Hayne: and thus the\r\nnullification cause was in powerful hands in the senate. Its proceedings\r\nwere watched with the most intense anxiety by the whole Union. The\r\ncrisis of the Union was come.\r\n\r\nIn the discontented State, the union party, which was strong, though\r\nexcluded from the government, was in great sorrow and fear. Civil war\r\nseemed inevitable; and they felt themselves oppressed and insulted by\r\nthe imposition of the oath of allegiance to the State. The nullifiers\r\njustified this requisition by saying that many foreigners resident in\r\nCharleston, who did not understand the case, believed that their duty to\r\nthe general government required them to support it, while its vessels of\r\nwar and troops were in port; however well they might be disposed to the\r\nnullification cause. It was merely as a method of enlightenment, it was\r\nprotested, that this oath was imposed.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, meanwhile, had a State Rights ball at the arsenal, and\r\ncontributed their jewels for the support of the expected war. I could\r\nnot learn that they made lint--the last test of woman's earnestness for\r\nwar; but I was told by a leading nullifier that the ladies were \"chock\r\nfull of fight.\" The expectation of war was so nearly universal that I\r\ncould hear of only one citizen of Charleston who discouraged the removal\r\nof his wife and children from the city, in the belief that a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the quarrel would take place.\r\n\r\nThe legislatures of the States passed resolutions, none of them\r\nadvocating nullification; (even Georgia forsaking that ground;) many\r\ncondemned the proceedings of South Carolina; but some, while doing so,\r\nmade strong remonstrances against the tariff. Five of the States, in\r\nwhich manufactures had been set up, declared their opposition to any\r\nalteration of the tariff. It is amusing now to read the variety of terms\r\nin which the South Carolina proceedings were condemned; though, at the\r\ntime, the reports of these resolutions must have carried despair to the\r\nhearts of the citizens of the solitary discontented State. The effect of\r\nthese successive shocks is still spoken of in strong and touching\r\nlanguage by those who had to sustain them.\r\n\r\nWhile the South Carolina militia were training, and the munitions of war\r\npreparing, the senators and representatives of the State were wearing\r\nstern and grave faces at Washington. The session was passing away, and\r\nnothing but debate was yet achieved. Their fellow legislators looked on\r\nthem with grief, as being destined to destruction in the field, or on\r\nthe scaffold. They were men of high spirit and gallantry; and it was\r\nclear that they had settled the matter with themselves and with each\r\nother. They would never submit to mere numbers; and would oppose force\r\nto force, till all of their small resources was spent. No one can\r\nestimate their heroism, or desperation, whichever it may be called, who\r\nhas not seen the city and State which would have been the theatre of the\r\nwar. The high spirit of South Carolina is of that kind which accompanies\r\nfallen, or inferior fortunes. Pride and poverty chafe the spirit. They\r\nmake men look around for injury, and aggravate the sense of injury when\r\nit is real. In South Carolina, the black population outnumbers the\r\nwhite. The curse of slavery lies heavy on the land, and its inhabitants\r\nshow the usual unwillingness of sufferers to attribute their maladies to\r\ntheir true cause. Right as the South Carolinians may be as to the\r\nprinciple of free trade, no tariff ever yet occasioned such evils as\r\nthey groan under. If not a single import duty had ever been imposed,\r\nthere would still have been the contrasts which they cannot endure to\r\nperceive between the thriving States of the north and their own. Now,\r\nwhen they see the flourishing villages of New England, they cry \"We pay\r\nfor all this.\" When the north appears to receive more favour from the\r\ngeneral government, in its retrospective recompenses for service in war,\r\nthe greater proportion of which service was rendered by the north, the\r\nsouth again cries, \"We pay for all this.\" It is true that the south pays\r\ndearly; but it is for her own depression, not for others' prosperity.\r\nWhen I saw the face of the nullifiers' country, I was indeed amazed at\r\ntheir hardihood. The rich soil, watered by full streams, the fertile\r\nbottoms, superintended by the planters' mansions, with their slave\r\nquarter a little removed from the house, the fine growth of trees, and\r\nof the few patches of pasturage which are to be seen, show how\r\nnourishing this region ought to be. But its aspect is most depressing to\r\nthe traveller. Roads nearly impassable in many parts, bridges carried\r\naway and not restored, lands exhausted, and dwellings forsaken, are\r\nspectacles too common in South Carolina. The young men, whose patrimony\r\nhas deteriorated, migrate westward with their 'force;' selling their\r\nlands, if they can; if not, forsaking them. There are yet many\r\nplantations of unsurpassed fertility; but there are many exhausted: and\r\nit is more profitable to remove to a virgin soil than to employ slave\r\nlabour in renovating the fertility of the old. There is an air of\r\nrudeness about the villages, and languor about the towns, which promise\r\nsmall resource in times of war and distress. And then, the wretched\r\nslave population is enough to paralyse the arm of the bravest community,\r\nand to ensure defeat to the best cause. I saw the soldiers and the\r\npreparations for war at Charleston, two years after the crisis was past.\r\nWhen I was to be shown the arms and ammunition, it appeared that \"the\r\ngentleman that had the key was not on the premises.\" This showed that no\r\nimmediate invasion was expected; but it was almost incredible what had\r\nbeen threatened with such resources. The precautionary life of the\r\ncommunity, on account of the presence of so large a body of slaves, may\r\nbe, in some sort, a training for war; but it points out the impediments\r\nto success. If South Carolina had, what some of her leading men seem to\r\ndesire, a Lacedemonian government, which should make every free man a\r\nsoldier, she would be farther from safety in peace, and success in war,\r\nthan any quaker community, exempt from the curse of a debased and\r\nwronged servile class. One glance over the city of Charleston is enough\r\nto show a stranger how helpless she is against a foreign foe, if\r\nunsupported. The soldiers met, at every turn, the swarms of servile\r\nblacks, the very luxuries and hospitalities of the citizens, grateful as\r\nthese luxuries are to the stranger, and honourable as these\r\nhospitalities are to his entertainers, betoken a state of society which\r\nhas no strength to spare from the great work of self-renovation. Those\r\nwho remained at home during the winter of 1832 and 1833, might be\r\nhopeful about the conflict, from being unaware of the depressed\r\ncondition of their State, in comparison with others: but the leaders at\r\nWashington might well look stern and grave. It is no impeachment of\r\ntheir bravery, if their hearts died within them, day by day.\r\n\r\nThe session was within fourteen days of its close, when Mr. Clay brought\r\nin a bill which had been carefully prepared as a compromise between the\r\ncontending parties. It provided that all import duties exceeding twenty\r\nper cent. should be gradually reduced, till, in 1842, they should have\r\ndeclined to that amount; leaving liberty to augment the duties again, in\r\ncase of war. This bill, with certain amendments, not affecting its\r\nprinciple, was passed, as was the Enforcing Bill,--for enforcing the\r\ncollection imposed by act of Congress. A convention was held in South\r\nCarolina: the obnoxious ordinance was repealed; the Enforcing Bill was,\r\nindeed, nominally nullified; but no powers were offered to the\r\nlegislature for enforcing the nullification; and the quarrel was, to all\r\nintents and purposes, at an end.\r\n\r\nThe triumph remained,--if triumph there were,--with South Carolina. This\r\nwas owing to the goodness of her principle of free trade; and in no\r\ndegree, to the reasonableness of her nullifying practices. The passage\r\nof the Compromise Bill was a wise and fortunate act. Its influence on\r\nthe planting and manufacturing interests is a subject to be considered\r\nin another connexion. Its immediate effect in honourably reconciling\r\ndifferences which had appeared irreconcileable, was a blessing, not only\r\nto the United States, but to the world. The lustre of democratic\r\nprinciples would have been shrouded to many eyes by a civil war among\r\nthe citizens of the Union; while now, the postponement of a danger so\r\nimminent, the healing of a breach so wide, has confirmed the confidence\r\nof many who feared that the States remained united only for want of a\r\ncause of separation.\r\n\r\nSome ill effects remain,--especially in the irritation of South\r\nCarolina. There is still an air of mystery and fellowship about the\r\nleading nullifiers, and of disquiet among the Union men of Charleston.\r\nBut there is cause enough for restlessness in Charleston, as I have\r\nbefore said; and much excuse for pique.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, these events have proved to thousands of republicans the\r\nmischief of compromise conveyed in vague phraseology, in so solemn an\r\ninstrument as a written constitution.\r\n\r\nThere could not have been a doubt on this case, if the question of\r\nconstruction had not had place, from the unfortunate clause ordaining\r\nthat the general government shall have all powers necessary for the\r\nfulfilment of certain declared purposes. While this provision, thus\r\nworded, remains, the nullification theory will be played off, from time\r\nto time. The good consequence will arise from this liability, that a\r\nhabit will be formed of construing the constitution liberally, with\r\nregard to the States, wherever there is a doubt as to the exercise of\r\nits powers; but this collateral good is no justification of the\r\nlooseness of language by which the peace and integrity of the Union have\r\nbeen made to hang on a point of construction. The people of the United\r\nStates will probably show their wisdom in henceforth accepting the\r\nbenefit by shunning the evil.\r\n\r\nIn the privacy of their houses, many citizens have lamented to me, with\r\nfeelings to which no name but grief can be given, that the events of\r\n1832--3 have suggested the words \"use\" or \"value of the Union.\" To an\r\nAmerican, a calculation of the value of the Union would formerly have\r\nbeen as offensive, as absurd, as an estimate of the value of religion\r\nwould be to a right-minded man. To Americans of this order, the Union\r\nhas long been more than a matter of high utility. It has been idealised\r\ninto an object of love and veneration. In answer to this _cui bono_,\r\nmany have cried in their hearts, with Lear, \"O reason not the need!\" I\r\nwas struck with the contrast in the tone of two statesmen, a chief\r\nnullifier and one of his chief opponents. The one would not disguise\r\nfrom me that the name of the Union had lost much of its charm in the\r\nsouth, since 1830. The other, in a glow, protested that he never would\r\nhear of the Union losing its charm.\r\n\r\nBut the instances of carelessness, of levity about the Union, are very\r\nrare; and this is the reason why more show of attachment to it is not\r\nmade. The probabilities of the continuance of the Union are so\r\noverwhelming, that no man, not in a state of delusion, from some strong\r\nprejudice, can seriously entertain the idea of a dissolution within any\r\nassignable period. I met with one gentleman in the north, a clergyman,\r\nwho expects and desires a dissolution of the Union, saying that the\r\nnorth bore all the expense of the war, and has had nothing but\r\nobstruction and injury from the south. I saw, also, one gentleman in\r\nSouth Carolina, who sees no use in the Union, but much expense and\r\ntrouble. He declares the only effect of it to be the withdrawing of the\r\nbest men from each State to dawdle away their time at Washington.\r\nAnother, who desponds about the condition of England, and whose views\r\nare often embellished, and sometimes impaired, by his perceptions of\r\nanalogy, expressed his fears that his own country, an offset from mine,\r\nwould share the fate of offsets, and perish with the parent. But these\r\nare examples of eccentricity.\r\n\r\nThere are many among the slave-holders of the south who threaten\r\nsecession. Such of these as are in earnest are under the mistake into\r\nwhich men fall when they put everything to the hazard of one untenable\r\nobject. The untenable object once relinquished, the delusion will clear\r\naway with the disappearance of its cause, and the Union will be to them,\r\nwith good reason, dearer than it has ever been. The southern States\r\ncould not exist, separately, with their present domestic institutions,\r\nin the neighbourhood of any others. They would have thousands of miles\r\nof frontier, over which their slaves would be running away, every day of\r\nthe year. In case of war, they might be only too happy if their slaves\r\ndid run away, instead of rising up against them at home. If it was\r\nnecessary to purchase, Florida because it was a retreat for runaways; if\r\nit was necessary, first to treat with Mexico for the restitution of\r\nrunaways, and then to steal Texas, the most high-handed theft of modern\r\ntimes; if it is necessary to pursue runaways into the northern States,\r\nand to keep magistrates and jails in perpetual requisition for the\r\nrestitution of southern human property, how would the southern States\r\nmanage by themselves? Only by ridding themselves of slavery; in which\r\ncase, their alleged necessity of separation is superseded. As for their\r\nresources,--the shoe-business of New York State is of itself larger and\r\nmore valuable than the entire commerce of Georgia,--the largest and\r\nrichest of the southern States.\r\n\r\nThe mere act of separation could not be accomplished. In case of war\r\nagainst the northern States, it would be necessary to employ half the\r\nwhite population to take care of the black; and of the remaining half,\r\nno one would undertake to say how many are at heart sick and weary of\r\nslavery, and would be, therefore, untrustworthy. The middle slave\r\nStates, now nearly ready to discard slavery, would seize so favourable\r\nan opportunity as that afforded them by the peril of the Union. The\r\nmiddle free States, from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi, having\r\neverything to lose by separation, and nothing to gain, would treat the\r\nfirst overt act as rebellion; proceeding against it, and punishing it as\r\nsuch. The case is so palpable as scarcely to need even so brief a\r\nstatement as this. The fact which renders such a statement worth making\r\nis, that most of those who threaten the dissolution of the Union, do it\r\nin order to divert towards this impracticable object the irritation\r\nwhich would otherwise, and which will, ere long, turn against the\r\ninstitution of slavery. The gaze of the world is fixed upon this\r\ninstitution. The world is shouting the one question about this anomaly\r\nwhich cannot be answered. The dwellers in the south would fain be\r\nunconscious of that awful gaze. They would fain not hear the\r\nreverberation of that shout. They would fain persuade themselves and\r\nothers, that they are too busy in asserting their rights and their\r\ndignity as citizens of the Union, to heed the world beyond.\r\n\r\nThis self and mutual deception will prove a merely temporary evil. The\r\nnatural laws which regulate communities, and the will of the majority,\r\nmay be trusted to preserve the good, and to remove the bad elements from\r\nwhich this dissension arises. It requires no gift of prophecy to\r\nanticipate the fate of an anomaly among a self-governing people. Slavery\r\nwas not always an anomaly; but it has become one. Its doom is therefore\r\nsealed; and its duration is now merely a question of time. Any anxiety\r\nin the computation of this time is reasonable; for it will not only\r\nremove a more tremendous cause than can ever again desolate society, but\r\nrestore the universality of that generous attachment to their common\r\ninstitutions which has been, and will be, to the American people,\r\nhonour, safety, and the means of perpetual progress.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] The Federalist, vol. i. p. 277.\r\n\r\n[4] Correspondence, vol. iv. p. 396.\r\n\r\n[5] Jefferson's Correspondence, vol. iii. pp. 467-476.\r\n\r\n[6] Jefferson's Correspondence, vol. iv. p. 236.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMORALS OF POLITICS.\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends\r\n     Upon that law as on the best of friends;\r\n     Whence, in a state where men are tempted still\r\n     To evil for a guard against worse ill,\r\n     And what in quality or act is best,\r\n     Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,\r\n     He fixes good on good alone, and owes\r\n     To virtue every triumph, that he knows.\"\r\n\r\n     _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder a pure despotism, the morals of politics would make but a very\r\nshort chapter. Mercy in the ruler; obedience in his officers, with,\r\nperhaps, an occasional stroke of remonstrance; and taxpaying in the\r\npeople, would comprehend the whole. Among a self-governing people, who\r\nprofess to take human equality for their great common principle, and the\r\ngolden rule for their political vow, a long chapter of many sections is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe morals of politics are not too familiar anywhere. The clergy are apt\r\nto leave out its topics from their list of subjects for the pulpit.\r\nWriters on morals make that chapter as brief as if they lived under the\r\npure despotism, supposed above. An honest newspaper, here and there, or\r\na newspaper honest for some particular occasion, and therefore\r\nuninfluential in its temporary honesty, are the only speakers on the\r\nmorals of politics. The only speakers; but not the only exhibitors.\r\nScattered here and there, through a vast reach of ages, and expanse of\r\ncommunities, there may be found, to bless his race, an honest statesman.\r\nStatesmen, free from the gross vices of peculation, sordid, selfish\r\nambition, cruelty and tergiversation, are not uncommon. But the last\r\ndegree of honesty has always been, and is still, considered incompatible\r\nwith statesmanship. To hunger and thirst after righteousness has been\r\nnaturally, as it were, supposed a disqualification for affairs; and a\r\nman, living for truth, and in a spirit of love, \"pure in the last\r\nrecesses of the mind,\" who should propose to seek truth through\r\npolitical action, and exercise love in the use of political influence,\r\nand refine his purity by disinfecting the political atmosphere of its\r\ncorruptions, would hear it reported on every hand that he had a demon.\r\nYet one who is aware of the enthusiasm with which the Germans hail the\r\nwords of Posa at every representation of Don Carlos; one who has seen\r\nhow American officials are supported by the people, on the supposition\r\nthat they are great men, (however small such men may really be,) one who\r\nhas watched the acceleration, within our own time, of the retribution\r\nwhich overtakes untrustworthy public men, whatever may be their talents\r\nand their knowledge, in contrast with the comparative stability of less\r\nable, but more honest men, can doubt no longer that the time is at hand\r\nfor the advent of political principle. The hour is come when dwellers in\r\nthe old world should require integrity of their rulers; and dwellers in\r\nthe new world, each in his turn a servant of society, should require it\r\nof each other and of themselves. The people of the United States are\r\nseeking after this, feebly and dimly. They have retained one wise saying\r\nof the fathers to whom they owe so much; that the letter of laws and\r\nconstitutions is a mere instrument; with no vitality; no power to\r\nprotect and bless; and that the spirit is all in all. They have been far\r\nfrom acting upon this with such steadiness as to show that they\r\nunderstand and believe it. But the saying is in their minds; and, like\r\nevery other true thing that lies there, it will in time exhibit itself\r\nin the appointed mode--the will of the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nOFFICE.\r\n\r\nI was told two things separately, last year, which, if put together,\r\nseem to yield an alarming result. I was told that almost every man holds\r\noffice, some time during his life; and that holding one is the ruin of\r\nmoral independence. The case is not, however, nearly so bad as this.\r\nThere is a kind of public life which does seem to injure the morals of\r\nall who enter it; but very few are affected by this. Office in a man's\r\nown neighbourhood, where his character and opinions are known, and where\r\nthe honour and emolument are small, is not very seductive: and these are\r\nthe offices filled by the greater number of citizens who serve society.\r\nThe temptation to propitiate opinion becomes powerful when a citizen\r\ndesires to enter the legislature, or to be the chief magistrate of the\r\nState. The peril increases when he becomes a candidate for Congress; and\r\nthere seems to be no expectation whatever that a candidate for the\r\npresidentship, or his partizans, should retain any simplicity of speech,\r\nor regard to equity in the distribution of places and promises. All this\r\nis dreadfully wrong. It originates in a grand mistake, which cannot be\r\nrectified but by much suffering. It is obvious that there must be\r\nmistake; for it can never be an arrangement of Providence that men\r\ncannot serve each other in their political relations without being\r\ncorrupted.\r\n\r\nThe primary mistake is in supposing that men cannot bear to hear the\r\ntruth. It has become the established method of seeking office, not only\r\nto declare a coincidence of opinion with the supposed majority, on the\r\ngreat topics on which the candidate will have to speak and act while in\r\noffice, but to deny, or conceal, or assert anything else which it is\r\nsupposed will please the same majority. The consequence is, that the\r\nbest men are not in office. The morally inferior who succeed, use their\r\npower for selfish purposes, to a sufficient extent to corrupt their\r\nconstituents, in their turn. I scarcely knew, at first, how to\r\nunderstand the political conversations which I heard in travelling. If a\r\ncitizen told another that A. had voted in a particular manner, the other\r\ninvariably began to account for the vote. A. had voted thus to please\r\nB., because B.'s influence was wanted for the benefit of C., who had\r\npromised so and so to A.'s brother, or son, or nephew, or leading\r\nsection of constituents. A reason for a vote, or other public\r\nproceeding, must always be found; and any reason seemed to be taken up\r\nrather than the obvious one, that a man votes according to the decision\r\nof his reason and conscience. I often mentioned this to men in office,\r\nor seeking to be so; and they received it with a smile or a laugh which\r\nwrung my heart. Of all heart-withering things, political scepticism in a\r\nrepublic is one of the most painful. I told Mr. Clay my observations in\r\nboth kinds. \"Let them laugh!\" cried he, with an honourable warmth: \"and\r\ndo you go on requiring honesty; and you will find it.\" He is right: but\r\nthose who would find the highest integrity had bettor not begin their\r\nobservations on office-holders, much less on office-seekers, as a class.\r\nThe office-holder finds, too often, that it may be easier to get into\r\noffice than to have power to discharge its duties when there: and then\r\nthe temptation to subservience, to dishonest silence, is well nigh too\r\nstrong for mortal man. The office-seeker stands committed as desiring\r\nsomething for which he is ready to sacrifice his business or profession,\r\nhis ease, his leisure, and the quietness of his reputation. He stands\r\nforth as either an adventurer, a man of ambition, or of self-sacrificing\r\npatriotism. Being once thus committed, failure is mortifying, and the\r\nallurement to compromise, in order to success, is powerful. Once in\r\npublic life, the politician is committed for ever, whether he\r\nimmediately perceives this, or not. Almost every public man of my\r\nacquaintance owned to me the difficulty of retiring,--in mind, if not in\r\npresence,--after the possession of a public trust. This painful\r\nhankering is part of the price to be paid for the honours of public\r\nservice: and I am disposed to think that it is almost universal; that\r\nscarcely any man knows quiet and content, from the moment of the success\r\nof his first election. The most modest men shrink from thus committing\r\nthemselves. The most learned men, generally speaking, devote themselves,\r\nin preference, to professions. The most conscientious men, generally\r\nspeaking, shun the snares which fatally beset public life, at present,\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of the latter class, whose talents and character would\r\nprocure him extensive and hearty support, if he desired it, told me,\r\nthat he would never serve in office, because he believes it to be the\r\ndestruction of moral independence: he pointed out to me three friends of\r\nhis, men of remarkable talent, all in public life. \"Look at them,\" said\r\nhe, \"and see what they might have been! Yet A. is a slave, B. is a\r\nslave, and C. is a worm in the dust.\" Too true.\r\n\r\nHere is a grievous misfortune to the republic! My friend ascribes it to\r\nthe want of protection from his neighbours, to which a man is exposed\r\nfrom the want of caste. This will never do. A crown and sceptre would be\r\nabout as desirable in a republic as caste. If men would only try the\r\neffect of faith in one another, I believe they would take rank, and\r\nyield protection, with more precision and efficacy than by any\r\nmanifestation of the exclusive spirit that was ever witnessed. Of\r\ncourse, this proposal will be called \"Quixotic;\" that convenient term\r\nwhich covers things the most serious and the most absurd, the wisest and\r\nthe wildest. I am strengthened in my suggestion by a recurrence to the\r\nfirst principles of society in the United States, according to which I\r\nfind that \"rulers derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned;\" and that the theory is, that the best men are chosen to\r\nserve. Both these pre-suppose mutual faith. Let the governed once\r\nrequire honesty as a condition of their consent; let them once choose\r\nthe best men, according to their most conscientious conviction, and\r\nthere will be an end of this insulting and disgusting political\r\nscepticism. Adventurers and ambitious men there will still be; but they\r\nwill not taint the character of the class. Better men, who will respect\r\ntheir constituents, without fearing or flattering them, will foster the\r\ngenerous mutual faith which is now so grievously wanting; and the spirit\r\nof the constitution, now drooping in some of its most important\r\ndepartments, will revive.\r\n\r\nI write more in hope than in immediate expectation. I saw much ground\r\nfor hope, but very much also for grief. Scarcely anything that I\r\nobserved in the United States caused me so much sorrow as the\r\ncontemptuous estimate of the people entertained by those who were bowing\r\nthe knee to be permitted to serve them. Nothing can be more disgusting\r\nthan the contrast between the drawing-room gentleman, at ease among\r\nfriends, and the same person courting the people, on a public occasion.\r\nThe only comfort was a strong internal persuasion that the people do not\r\nlike to be courted thus. They have been so long used to it, that they\r\nreceive it as a matter of course; but, I believe, if a candidate should\r\noffer, who should make no professions but of his opinions, and his\r\nhonest intentions of carrying them out; if he should respect the people\r\nas men, not as voters, and inform them truly of his views of their\r\ncondition and prospects, they would recognise him at once as their best\r\nfriend. He might, notwithstanding, lose his election; for the people\r\nmust have time to recover, or to attain simplicity; but he would serve\r\nthem better by losing his election thus, than by the longest and most\r\nfaithful service in public life.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered whether a gentleman at Laporte, in Indiana, who\r\nadvertised his desire to be sheriff, gained his election. He declared in\r\nhis advertisement that he had not been largely solicited, but that it\r\nwas his own desire that he should be sheriff: he would not promise to do\r\naway with mosquitoes, ague, and fever, but only to do his duty. This\r\ncandidate has his own way of flattering his constituents.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of considerable reputation offered, last year, to deliver a\r\nlecture, in a Lyceum, in Massachusetts. It was upon the French\r\nRevolution; and on various accounts curious. There was no mention of the\r\ncauses of the Revolution, except in a parenthesis of one sentence,\r\nwhere he intimated that French society was not in harmony with the\r\nspirit of the age. He sketched almost every body concerned, except the\r\nQueen. The most singular part, perhaps, was his estimate of the military\r\ntalents of Napoleon. He exalted them much, and declared him a greater\r\ngeneral than Wellington, but not so great as Washington. The audience\r\nwas large and respectable. I knew a great many of the persons present,\r\nand found that none of them liked the lecture.\r\n\r\nI attended another Lyceum lecture in Massachusetts. An agent of the\r\nColonisation Society lectured; and, when he had done, introduced a\r\nclergyman of colour, who had just returned from Liberia, and could give\r\nan account of the colony in its then present state. As soon as this\r\ngentleman came forward, a party among the audience rose, and went out,\r\nwith much ostentation of noise. Mr. Wilson broke off till he could be\r\nagain heard, and then observed in a low voice, \"that would not have been\r\ndone in Africa;\" upon which, there was an uproar of applause, prolonged\r\nand renewed. All the evidence on the subject that I could collect, went\r\nto prove that the people can bear, and do prefer to hear, the truth. It\r\nis a crime to withhold it from them; and a double crime to substitute\r\nflattery.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the orations was the sole, but great drawback from the\r\nenjoyment of the popular festivals I witnessed. I missed the celebration\r\nof the 4th of July,--both years; being, the first year, among the\r\nVirginia mountains, (where the only signs of festivity which I saw, were\r\nsome slaves dressing up a marquee, in which their masters were to feast,\r\nafter having read, from the Declaration of Independence, that all men\r\nare created free and equal, and that rulers derive their just powers\r\nfrom the consent of the governed;) and the second year on the lakes,\r\narriving at Mackinaw too late in the evening of the great day for any\r\ncelebration that might have taken place. But I was at two remarkable\r\nfestivals, and heard two very remarkable orations. They were represented\r\nto me as fair or favourable specimens of that kind of address; and, to\r\njudge by the general sum of those which I read and heard, they were so.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Connecticut is the most fertile valley in New England;\r\nand it is scarcely possible that any should be more beautiful. The\r\nriver, full, broad, and tranquil as the summer sky, winds through\r\nmeadows, green with pasture, or golden with corn. Clumps of forest trees\r\nafford retreat for the cattle in the summer heats; and the magnificent\r\nNew England elm, the most graceful of trees, is dropped singly, here and\r\nthere, and casts its broad shade upon the meadow. Hills of various\r\nheight and declivity bound the now widening, now contracting valley. To\r\nthese hills, the forest has retired; the everlasting forest, from which,\r\nin America, we cannot fly. I cannot remember that, except in some parts\r\nof the prairies, I was ever out of sight of the forest in the United\r\nStates and I am sure I never wished to be so. It was like the \"verdurous\r\nwall of Paradise,\" confining the mighty southern and western rivers to\r\ntheir channels. We were, as it appeared, imprisoned in it for many days\r\ntogether, as we traversed the south-eastern States. We threaded it in\r\nMichigan; we skirted it in New York and Pennsylvania; and throughout New\r\nEngland it bounded every landscape. It looked down upon us from the\r\nhill-tops; it advanced into notice from every gap and notch in the\r\nchain. To the native it must appear as indispensable in the\r\npicture-gallery of nature as the sky. To the English traveller it is a\r\nspecial boon, an added charm, a newly-created grace, like the infant\r\nplanet that wanders across the telescope of the astronomer. The English\r\ntraveller finds himself never weary by day of prying into the forest,\r\nfrom beneath its canopy: or, from a distance drinking in its exquisite\r\nhues: and his dreams, for months or years, will be of the mossy roots,\r\nthe black pine, and silvery birch stems, the translucent green shades of\r\nthe beech, and the slender creeper, climbing like a ladder into the\r\ntopmost boughs of the dark holly, a hundred feet high. He will dream of\r\nthe march of the hours through the forest; the deep blackness of night,\r\nbroken by the dun forest-fires, and startled by the showers of sparks,\r\nsent abroad by the casual breeze from the burning stems. He will hear\r\nagain the shrill piping of the whip-poor-will, and the multitudinous din\r\nfrom the occasional swamp. He will dream of the deep silence which\r\nprecedes the dawn; of the gradual apparition of the haunting trees,\r\ncoming faintly out of the darkness; of the first level rays,\r\ninstantaneously piercing the woods to their very heart, and lighting\r\nthem up into boundless ruddy colonnades, garlanded with wavy verdure,\r\nand carpeted with glittering wild-flowers. Or, he will dream of the\r\nclouds of gay butterflies, and gauzy dragon-flies, that hover above the\r\nnoon-day paths of the forest, or cluster about some graceful shrub,\r\nmaking it appear to bear at once all the flowers of Eden. Or the golden\r\nmoon will look down through his dream, making for him islands of light\r\nin an ocean of darkness. He may not see the stars but by glimpses; but\r\nthe winged stars of those regions,--the gleaming fire-flies,--radiate\r\nfrom every sleeping bough, and keep his eye in fancy busy in following\r\ntheir glancing, while his spirit sleeps in the deep charms of the summer\r\nnight. Next to the solemn and various beauty of the sea and the sky,\r\ncomes that of the wilderness. I doubt whether the sublimity of the\r\nvastest mountain-range can exceed that of the all-pervading forest, when\r\nthe imagination becomes able to realise the conception of what it is.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Connecticut, the forest merely presides over the\r\nscene, giving gravity to its charm. On East Mountain, above Deerfield,\r\nin Massachusetts, it is mingled with grey rocks, whose hue mingles\r\nexquisitely with its verdure. We looked down from thence on a long reach\r\nof the valley, just before sunset, and made ourselves acquainted with\r\nthe geography of the catastrophe which was to be commemorated in a day\r\nor two. Here and there, in the meadows, were sinkings of the soil,\r\nshallow basins of verdant pasturage, where there had probably once been\r\nsmall lakes, but where cattle were now grazing. The unfenced fields,\r\nsecure within landmarks, and open to the annual inundation which\r\npreserves their fertility, were rich with unharvested Indian corn; the\r\ncobs left lying in their sheaths, because no passer-by is tempted to\r\nsteal them; every one having enough of his own. The silvery river lay\r\namong the meadows; and on its bank, far below us, stretched the avenue\r\nof noble trees, touched with the hues of autumn, which shaded the\r\nvillage of Deerfield. Saddleback bounded our view opposite, and the\r\nNorthampton hills and Green Mountains on the left. Smoke arose, here and\r\nthere, from the hills' sides, and the nearer eminences were dotted with\r\nwhite dwellings, of the same order with the homesteads which were\r\nsprinkled over the valley. The time is past when a man feared to sit\r\ndown further off than a stone's throw from his neighbours, lest the\r\nIndians should come upon him. The villages of Hadley and Deerfield are a\r\nstanding memorial of those times, when the whites clustered together\r\naround the village church, and their cattle were brought into the area,\r\nevery night, under penalty of their being driven off before morning.\r\nThese villages consist of two rows of houses, forming a long street,\r\nplanted with trees; and the church stands in the middle. The houses, of\r\nwood, were built in those days with the upper story projecting; that the\r\ninhabitants, in case of siege, might fire at advantage upon the Indians,\r\nforcing the door with tomahawks.\r\n\r\nI saw an old house of this kind at Deerfield,--the only one which\r\nsurvived the burning of the village by the French and Indians, in 1704,\r\nwhen all the inhabitants, to the number of two hundred and eighty, being\r\nattacked in their sleep, were killed or carried away captive by the\r\nIndians. The wood of the house was old and black, and pierced in many\r\nparts with bullet-holes. One had given passage to a bullet which shot a\r\nwoman in the neck, as she rose up in bed, on hearing the tomahawk strike\r\nupon the door. The battered door remains, to chill one's blood with the\r\nthought that such were the blows dealt by the Indians upon the skulls of\r\ntheir victims, whether infants or soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis was not the event to commemorate which we were assembled at\r\nDeerfield. A monument was to be erected on the spot where another body\r\nof people had been murdered, by savage foes of the same race. Deerfield\r\nwas first settled in 1671; a few houses being then built on the present\r\nstreet, and the settlers being on good terms with their neighbours. King\r\nPhilip's war broke out in 1675, and the settlers were attacked more than\r\nonce. There was a large quantity of grain stored up at Deerfield; and it\r\nwas thought advisable to remove it for safety to Hadley, fifteen miles\r\noff. Captain Lothrop, with eighty men, and some teams, marched from\r\nHadley to remove the grain; his men being the youth and main hope of\r\nthe settlements around. On their return from Deerfield, on the 30th of\r\nSeptember 1675, about four miles and a half on the way to Hadley, the\r\nyoung men dispersed to gather the wild grapes that were hanging ripe in\r\nthe thickets, and were, under this disadvantage, attacked by a large\r\nbody of Indians. It was afterwards discovered that the only way to\r\nencounter the Indians is in phalanx. Captain Lothrop did not know this;\r\nand he posted his men behind trees, where they were, almost to a man,\r\npicked off by the enemy. About ninety-three, including the teamsters,\r\nfell. When all was over, help arrived. The Indians were beaten; but they\r\nappeared before the village, some days after, shaking the scalps and\r\nbloody garments of the slain captain and his troop, before the eyes of\r\nthe inhabitants. The place was afterwards abandoned by the settlers,\r\ndestroyed by the Indians, and not rebuilt for some years.\r\n\r\nThis was a piteous incident in the history of the settlement; but it is\r\nnot easy to see why it should be made an occasion of commemoration, by\r\nmonument and oratory, in preference to many others which have a stronger\r\nmoral interest attaching to them. Some celebrations, like that of\r\nForefather's Day, are inexpressibly interesting and valuable, from the\r\nglorious recollections by which they are sanctified. But no virtue was\r\nhere to be had in remembrance; nothing but mere misery. The\r\ncontemplation of mere misery is painful and hurtful; and the only\r\nsalutary influence that I could perceive to arise from this occasion was\r\na far-fetched and dubious one,--thankfulness that the Indians are not\r\nnow at hand to molest the white inhabitants. Then occurs the question\r\nabout the Indians,--\"where are they?\" and the answer leaves one less\r\nsympathy than one would wish to have with the present security of the\r\nsettler. The story of King Philip, who is supposed to have headed, in\r\nperson, the attack on Lothrop's troop, is one of the most melancholy in\r\nthe records of humanity; and sorrow for him must mingle with\r\ncongratulations to the descendants of his foes, who, in his eyes, were\r\nrobbers. With these thoughts in my mind, I found it difficult to\r\ndiscover the philosophy of this celebration. A stranger might be\r\npardoned for being so slow.\r\n\r\nOne of the then candidates for the highest office in the State, is\r\nrenowned for his oratory. He is one of the most accomplished scholars\r\nand gentlemen that the country possesses. It was thought, \"by his\r\nfriends,\" that his interest wanted strengthening in the western part of\r\nthe State. The people were pleased when any occasion procured them the\r\n_éclat_ of bringing a celebrated orator over to address them. The\r\ncommemoration of an Indian catastrophe was thought of as an occasion\r\ncapable of being turned to good electioneering purposes.--Mr. Webster\r\nwas invited to be the orator, it being known that he would refuse. \"Not\r\nI,\" said he. \"I won't go and rake up old bloody Indian stories.\" The\r\ncandidate was next invited, and, of course, took the opportunity of\r\n\"strengthening his interest in the western part of the State.\" I was not\r\naware of this till I sometime after heard it, on indisputable authority.\r\nI should have enjoyed it much less than I did, if I had known that the\r\nwhole thing was got up, or its time and manner chosen, for\r\nelectioneering objects; that advantage was taken of the best feelings of\r\nthe people for the political interest of one.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the 29th we went to Bloody Brook, the fearfully-named\r\nplace of disaster. We climbed the Sugar-loaf; a high, steep hill, from\r\nwhose precipitous sides is obtained a view of the valley which pleases\r\nme more than the celebrated one from Mount Holyoke, a few miles off.\r\nEach, however, is perfect in its way; and both so like heaven, when one\r\nlooks down upon the valley in the light of an autumn afternoon,--such a\r\nlight as never yet burnished an English scene,--that no inclination is\r\nleft to make comparisons. The ox team was in the fields, the fishers on\r\nthe banks of the grey river,--banks and fishers reflected to the\r\nlife,--all as tranquil as if there was to be no stir the next day.\r\n\r\nOn descending, we went to the Bloody Brook Inn, and saw the strange and\r\nhorrible picture of the slaughter of Lothrop's troop; a picture so bad\r\nas to be laughable; but too horrible to be laughed at. Every man of the\r\neighty exactly alike, and all looking scared at being about to be\r\nscalped. We saw, also, the long tables spread for the feast of\r\nto-morrow. Lengths of unbleached cotton for table cloths, plates and\r\nglasses, were already provided. Some young men were bringing in long\r\ntrails of the wild vine, clustered with purple grapes, to hang about the\r\nyoung maple trees which overshadowed the tables; others were trying the\r\ncannon. We returned home in a state of high expectation.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 30th was bright, but rather cold. It was doubtful how\r\nfar prudence would warrant our sitting in an orchard for several hours,\r\nin such a breeze as was blowing. It was evident, however, that persons\r\nat a distance had no scruples on the subject, so thickly did they throng\r\nto the place of meeting. The wagon belonging to the band passed my\r\nwindows, filled with young ladies from the High School at Greenfield.\r\nThey looked as gay as if they had been going to a fair. By half-past\r\neight, our party set off, accompanied by a few, and passing a great\r\nnumber of strangers from distant villages.\r\n\r\nAfter having accomplished our drive of three or four miles, we warmed\r\nourselves in a friendly house, and repaired to the orchard to choose our\r\nseats, while the ceremony of laying the first stone of the monument was\r\nproceeding at some distance. The platform from which the orator was to\r\naddress the assemblage was erected under a rather shabby walnut-tree,\r\nwhich was rendered less picturesque by its lower branches being lopped\r\noff, for the sake of convenience. Several men had perched themselves on\r\nthe tree; and I was beginning to wonder how they would endure their\r\nuncomfortable seat, in the cold wind, for three hours, when I saw them\r\ncalled down, and dismissed to find places among the rest of the\r\nassemblage, as they sent down bark and dust upon the heads of those who\r\nsat on the platform. Long and deep ranges of benches were provided; and\r\non these, with carriage cushions and warm cloaks, we found ourselves\r\nperfectly well accommodated. Nothing could be better. It was a pretty\r\nsight. The wind rustled fitfully in the old walnut-tree. The audience\r\ngathered around, it were sober, quiet; some would have said dull. The\r\ngirls appeared to me to be all pretty, after the fashion of American\r\ngirls. Every body was well-dressed; and such a thing as ill-behaviour in\r\nany village assemblage in New England, is, I believe, unheard of. The\r\nsoldiers were my great amusement; as they were on the few other\r\noccasions when I had the good fortune to see any. Their chief business,\r\non the present occasion, was to keep clear the seats which were reserved\r\nfor the band, now absent with the procession. These seats were\r\nadvantageously placed; and new-comers were every moment taking\r\npossession of them, and had to be sent, disappointed, into the rear. It\r\nwas moving to behold the loving entreaties of the soldiers that these\r\nseats might be vacated. I saw one, who had shrunk away from his\r\nuniform, (probably from the use of tobacco, of which his mouth was\r\nfull,) actually put his arm round the neck of a gentleman, and smile\r\nimploringly in his face. It was irresistible, and the gentleman moved\r\naway. It is a perfect treat to the philanthropist to observe the pacific\r\nappearance of the militia throughout the United States. It is well known\r\nhow they can fight, when the necessity arises: but they assuredly look,\r\nat present, as if it was the last thing in their intentions:--as I hope\r\nit may long be.\r\n\r\nThe band next arrived, leading the procession of gentlemen, and were\r\nsoon called into action by the first hymn. They did their best; and, if\r\nno one of their instruments could reach the second note of the German\r\nHymn, (the second note of three lines out of four,) it was not for want\r\nof trying.\r\n\r\nThe oration followed. I strove, as I always did, not to allow difference\r\nof taste, whether in oratory, or in anything else, to render me\r\ninsensible to the merit, in its kind, of what was presented to me: but,\r\nupon this occasion, all my sympathies were baffled, and I was deeply\r\ndisgusted. It mattered little what the oration was in itself, if it had\r\nonly belonged in character to the speaker. If a Greenfield farmer or\r\nmechanic had spoken as he believed orators to speak, and if the failure\r\nhad been complete, I might have been sorry or amused, or disappointed;\r\nbut not disgusted. But here was one of the most learned and accomplished\r\ngentlemen in the country, a candidate for the highest office in the\r\nState, grimacing like a mountebank before the assemblage whose votes he\r\ndesired to have, and delivering an address, which he supposed level to\r\ntheir taste and capacity. He spoke of the \"stately tree,\" (the poor\r\nwalnut,) and the \"mighty assemblage,\" (a little flock in the middle of\r\nan orchard,) and offered them shreds of tawdry sentiment, without the\r\nintermixture of one sound thought, or simple and natural feeling, simply\r\nand naturally expressed. It was equally an under estimate of his\r\nhearers, and a degradation of himself.\r\n\r\nThe effect was very plain. Many, I know, were not interested, but were\r\nunwilling to say so of so renowned an orator. All were dull; and it was\r\neasy to see that none of the proper results of public speaking followed.\r\nThese very people are highly imaginative. Speak to them of what\r\ninterests them, and they are moved with a word. Speak to those whose\r\nchildren are at school, of the progress and diffusion of knowledge, and\r\nthey will hang upon the lips of the speaker. Speak to the\r\nunsophisticated among them of the case of the slave, and they are ready\r\nto brave Lynch-law on his behalf. Appeal to them on any religious or\r\ncharitable enterprise, and the good deed is done, almost as soon as\r\nindicated. But they have been taught to consider the oratory of set\r\npersons on set occasions as a matter of business or of pastime. They\r\nlisten to it, make their remarks upon it, vote, perhaps, that it shall\r\nbe printed, and go home, without having been so much moved as by a dozen\r\ncasual remarks, overheard upon the road.\r\n\r\nAll this would be of little importance, if these orations consisted of\r\nnarrative,--or of any mere matter of fact. The grievance lies in the\r\nprostitution of moral sentiment, the clap-trap of praise and pathos,\r\nwhich is thus criminally adventured. This is one great evil. Another, as\r\ngreat, both to orators and listeners, is the mis-estimate of the people.\r\nNo insolence and meanness can surpass those of the man of sense and\r\ntaste who talks beneath himself to the people, because he thinks it\r\nsuits them. No good parent ventures to do so to his youngest child; and\r\na candidate for office who will do it, shows himself ignorant of that\r\nwhich it is most important he should know,--what fidelity of deference\r\nevery man owes to every other man. Is such a one aware that he is\r\nperpetually saying in his heart, \"God! I thank thee that I am not as\r\nother men are?\"\r\n\r\nThe other festival, to which I have alluded, was the celebration of\r\nForefathers' Day;--of the landing of the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock. I\r\ntrust that this anniversary will be hailed with honour, as long as\r\nMassachusetts overlooks the sea. A more remarkable, a nobler enterprise,\r\nwas never kept in remembrance by a grateful posterity, than the\r\nemigration of the Pilgrim Fathers; and their posterity are, at least, so\r\nfar worthy of them as that they all, down to the young children, seem to\r\nhave a clear understanding of the nature of the act, and the character\r\nof the men. I never beheld the popular character in a more cheering\r\nlight than on this occasion; and, if I happened to be acquainted with a\r\nmisanthrope, I would send him to Plymouth, to keep Forefathers' Day.\r\nEvery fact that I review, every line that I write, brings back\r\ndelightful feelings towards some of the affectionate and hospitable\r\nfriends through whose kindness I saw and learned whatever I learned of\r\ntheir country; but to none am I more thankful than to those who took me\r\nto Plymouth, and those who welcomed me there. It was an occasion when\r\nnone could be on any other terms than pure brotherhood with all the\r\nrest. It was the great birth-day of the New England people; and none\r\ncould fail to wish the people joy.\r\n\r\nMy party and I reached Plymouth from Hingham the day before the\r\ncelebration. As we drew near the coast, I anxiously watched the\r\ncharacter of the scenery, trying to view it with the eyes of the first\r\nemigrants. It must have struck a chill to their hearts;--so bare, so\r\nbarren, so wintry. The firs grew more and more stunted, as we approached\r\nthe sea; till, as one of my companions observed, they were ashamed to\r\nshow themselves any smaller, and so turned into sand. Mrs. Hemans calls\r\nit, in her fine lyric, a rock-bound coast; naturally enough, as she was\r\ntold that the pilgrims set their feet on a rock, on landing; but that\r\nrock was the only one. The coast is low and sandy. The aspect of the bay\r\nwas, this day, most dreary. We had travelled through snow, all the way\r\nbehind; snowy fields, with here and there a solitary crow stalking in\r\nthe midst; and now, there was nothing but ice before us. Dirty, grey\r\nice, some sheeted, some thrown up by the action of the sea into heaps,\r\nwas all that was to be seen, instead of the blue and glittering sea. A\r\nfriend assured me, however, that all would be bright and cheering the\r\nnext morning; informing me, with a smile, that in the belief of the\r\ncountry people, it never did rain or snow, and never would rain or snow,\r\non Forefathers' Day. This is actually a superstition firmly held in the\r\nneighbourhood. This friend pointed out to me, in the course of the\r\nafternoon, how the green grass was appearing through the snow on Burial\r\nHill, on whose slope the descending sun, warm for December, was shining.\r\nWe mounted Burial Hill; and when I trod the turf, after some weeks'\r\nwalking over crisp snow, I began to feel that I might grow superstitious\r\ntoo, if I lived at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nUpwards of half the pilgrim company died the first winter. Fifty-one\r\ndropped in succession; and the graves of most of them are on this hill.\r\nBurial Hill was probably chosen to be a _memento mori_ to the pious\r\npilgrims; its elevation, bristling with grave-stones, being conspicuous\r\nfrom every part of the town. But, lest it should exhibit their tale of\r\ndisaster to their foes, the Indians, the colonists sowed the place of\r\ntheir dead with corn; making it, for honest purposes, a whited\r\nsepulchre. From this eminence, we saw the island in the harbour where\r\nthe fathers landed for service on the first Sunday after their arrival;\r\nalso, the hill on which stood a wigwam, from whence issued an Indian to\r\nhold the first parley. A brook flowed between the two hills, on which\r\nstood the Indian and the chief of the intruders. Governor Winslow\r\ndescended to the brook; bridged it with stepping-stones, in sight of the\r\nIndian; laid down his arms, and advanced. The meeting was friendly; but\r\nthere was so little feeling of security, for long after, that when half\r\nthe colonists had perished, the rest were paraded round and round a hut\r\non Burial Hill, to conceal the smallness of their numbers from the\r\nvigilant Indians.\r\n\r\nWe went to the Registry Office, and saw the earliest records of the\r\ncolony,--as far back as 1623,--in the handwriting of the fathers. Among\r\nthem is a record of the lots of land appointed to those who came over in\r\nthe Mayflower. (Little did the builders of that ship dream how they were\r\nworking for immortality!) Sometimes a cow is appointed, with a lot, to\r\nsix families. Sometimes a black goat. The red cow is ordained to be kept\r\nfor the poor, to calve.\r\n\r\nThe rock on which the pilgrims first landed, has been split, and the top\r\npart, in order to its preservation, removed within an iron railing, in\r\nfront of Pilgrim Hall. The memorable date of the landing, 1620, is\r\npainted upon it; and the names of the fathers, in cast-iron, are\r\ninserted into the railing which surrounds the rock.\r\n\r\nWithin the Hall, a plain, spacious building, erected within ten years,\r\nto serve as the scene of the festivities of Forefathers' Day, and also\r\nas a Museum of Pilgrim curiosities, is a picture, by Sargent, of the\r\nLanding of the Pilgrims. Samosat, the Indian chief, is advancing, with\r\nEnglish words of greeting,--\"Welcome, Englishmen!\" Elder Brewster, and\r\nthe other fathers, with their apprehensive wives and wondering children,\r\nform an excellent group; and the Mayflower is seen moored in the\r\ndistance. The greatest defect in the picture is the introduction of the\r\nblasted tree, which needlessly adds to the desolation of the scene, and\r\ngives a false idea, as far as it goes. I could not have anticipated the\r\ninterest which these memorials would inspire. I felt as if in a dream,\r\nthe whole time that I was wandering about with the rejoicing people,\r\namong the traces of the heroic men and women who came over into the\r\nperilous wilderness, in search of freedom of worship.\r\n\r\nForefathers' Day rose bright and mild. I looked out towards the harbour.\r\nEvery flake of ice was gone, and the deep blue sea rippled and sparkled\r\nin the sun. The superstition was fated to endure another year, at least.\r\nAll Plymouth was in a joyous bustle, with lines of carriages, and groups\r\nof walkers. After breakfast, we proceeded to the church, to await the\r\norator of the day. We were detained on the steps for a few minutes, till\r\nthe doors should be opened; and I was glad of it, for the sun was warm,\r\nand the _coup d'oeil_ was charming. There was one long descent from the\r\nchurch down to the glittering sea; and on the slope were troops of gay\r\nladies, and lines of children; with here and there a company of little\r\nboys, playing soldiers to the music of the band, which came faintly from\r\nafar. Of real soldiers, I saw two during the day. There might be more;\r\nbut none were needed. The strangest association of all was of a Pilgrim\r\nOde sung to the tune of \"God save the King!\" an air which I should have\r\nsupposed no more likely to be chosen for such an occasion than as an\r\nepilogue to the Declaration of Independence. It did very well, however.\r\nIt set us all singing so as to drown the harmony of the violins and\r\nhorns which acted as instigation.\r\n\r\nThe oration was by an ex-senator of the United States. It consisted\r\nwholly of an elaboration of the transcendent virtues of the people of\r\nNew England. His manner was more quiet than that of any other orator I\r\nheard; and I really believe that there was less of art than of weakness\r\nand bad taste in his choice of his mode of address. Nothing could be\r\nimagined worse,--more discordant with the fitting temper of the\r\noccasion,--more dangerous to the ignorant, if such there were,--more\r\ndisgusting to the wise, (as I know, on the testimony of such,)--more\r\nunworthy of one to whom the ear of the people was open. He told his\r\nhearers of the superiority of their physical, intellectual, and moral\r\nconstitution to that of their brethren of the middle and southern\r\nStates, to that of Europeans, and all other dwellers in the earth; a\r\nsuperiority which forbade their being ever understood and appreciated by\r\nany but themselves. He spoke especially of the intensity of the New\r\nEngland character, as being a hidden mystery from all but natives. He\r\ncontrasted the worst circumstances of European society, (now in course\r\nof correction,) with the best of New England arrangements, and drew the\r\nobvious inferences. He excused the bigotry of the Pilgrim Fathers, their\r\ncruel persecution of the Quakers, and other such deeds, on the ground\r\nthat they had come over to have the colony to themselves, and did not\r\nwant interlopers. He extenuated the recent mobbing practices in New\r\nEngland, on the ground of their rarity and small consequences, and\r\ndeclared it impossible that the sons of the pilgrims should trust to\r\nviolence for the maintenance of opinion. This last sentiment, the only\r\nsound one that I perceived in the oration, was loudly cheered. The whole\r\nof the rest, I rejoice to say, fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe orator was unworthy of his hearers. He had been a senator of the\r\nUnited States, and had, I was told, discharged his duty there; but he\r\nwas little fit for public life, if he did not know that it is treason to\r\nrepublicanism to give out lower morals in public than are held in\r\nprivate; to smile or sigh over the vanity of the people by the fireside,\r\nand pamper it from the rostrum; to use the power of oratory to injure\r\nthe people, instead of to save. In this case, the exaggeration was so\r\nexcessive as to be, I trust, harmless. No man of common sense could be\r\nmade to believe that any community of mortal men has ever been what the\r\norator described the inhabitants of New England to have attained. I was\r\ndeeply touched by the first remark I heard upon this oration. A lady,\r\nwho had been prevented from attending, asked me, on my return, home, how\r\nI liked the address. Before I could open my lips to reply, her daughter\r\nspoke. \"I am heart-sick of this boasting. When I think of our\r\nforefathers, I want to cry, 'God be merciful to us sinners!'\" If the\r\noration awakened in others, as I believe it did, by force of contrast,\r\nfeelings as healthful, as faithful to the occasion as this, it was not\r\nlost, and our pity must rest upon the orator.\r\n\r\nI am aware,--I had but too much occasion to observe,--how this practice\r\nof flattering the people from the rostrum is accounted for, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, smiled at by citizens of the United States. I know that\r\nit is considered as a mode, inseparable from the philosophy of politics\r\nthere. I dissent from this view altogether. I see that the remedy lies,\r\nnot wholly where remedies for the oppression of severe natural laws\r\nlie,--in a new combination of outward circumstances,--but in the\r\nindividual human will. The people may have honest orators if they\r\nchoose to demand to hear the truth. The people will gladly hear the\r\ntruth, if the appointed orator will lay aside selfish fears and desires,\r\nand use his high privilege of speaking from the bottom of his soul. If,\r\nin simplicity, he delivers to the people his true and best self, he is\r\ncertain to gain the convictions of many, and the sympathies of all; and\r\nhis soul will be clear of the guilt of deepening the pit under the feet\r\nof the people, while trying to persuade them that they are treading on\r\nfirm ground. What is to be said of guides who dig pitfalls?\r\n\r\nThe day closed delightfully. Almost everybody went to pay respect to an\r\naged lady, then eighty-eight, a regular descendant of one of the\r\npilgrims. She was confined to the sofa, but retained much beauty, and\r\nabundant cheerfulness. She was delighted to receive us, and to\r\nsympathise in those pleasures of the day which she could not share. I\r\nhad the honour of sitting in the chair which her ancestor brought over\r\nfrom England, and of feeling the staple by which it was fastened in the\r\nMayflower.\r\n\r\nThe dinner being over, the gentlemen returned to their several abodes,\r\nto escort the ladies to the ball in Pilgrim Hall. I went, with a party\r\nof seven others, in a stage coach; every carriage, native and exotic,\r\nbeing in requisition to fill the ball-room, from which no one was\r\nexcluded. It was the only in-door festival, except the President's\r\nlevee, where I witnessed an absolutely general admission; and its aspect\r\nand conduct were, in the highest degree, creditable to the intelligence\r\nand manners of the community. There were families from the islands in\r\nthe bay, and other country residences, whence the inhabitants seldom\r\nemerge, except for this festival. The dress of some of the young ladies\r\nwas peculiar, and their glee was very visible; but I saw absolutely no\r\nvulgarity. There was much beauty, and much elegance among the young\r\nladies, and the manners of their parents were unexceptionable. There was\r\nevidence in the dancing, of the \"intensity\" of which we had heard so\r\nmuch in the morning. The lads and lasses looked as if they meant never\r\nto tire; but this enjoyment of the exercise pleased me much more than\r\nthe affectation of dancing, which is now fashionable in the large\r\ncities. I never expect to see a more joyous and unexceptionable piece of\r\nfestivity than the Pilgrim ball of 1835.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the harbour was all frozen over; and the memory of the\r\nblue, rippling sea of Plymouth, is therefore, with me, sacred to\r\nForefathers' Day.\r\n\r\nI was frequently reminded by friends of what is undoubtedly very true,\r\nthe great perils of office in the United States, as an excuse for the\r\nwant of honesty in officials. It is perfectly true that it is ruin to a\r\nprofessional man without fortune, to enter public life for a time, and\r\nthen be driven back into private life. I knew a senator of the United\r\nStates who had served for nearly his twice six years, and who then had\r\nto begin life again, as regarded his profession. I knew a representative\r\nof the United States, a wealthy man, with a large family, who is\r\ndoubting still, as he has been for a few years past, whether he shall\r\ngive up commerce or public life, or go on trying to hold them both. He\r\nis rich enough to devote himself to public life; but at the very next\r\nelection after he has relinquished his commercial affairs, he may be\r\nthrown out of politics. I see what temptations arise in such cases, to\r\nstrain a few points, in order to remain in the public eye; and I am\r\nwilling to allow for the strength of the temptation.\r\n\r\nBut the part for honest men to take is to expose the peril, to the end\r\nthat the majority may find a remedy; and not to sanction it by yielding\r\nto it. Let the attention of the people be drawn towards the salaries of\r\noffice, that they may discover whether they are too low; which is best,\r\nthat adventurers of bad character should now and then get into office,\r\nbecause they have not reputation enough to obtain a living by other\r\nmeans, or that honest and intelligent men should be kept out, because\r\nthe prizes of office are engrossed by more highly educated men; and\r\nwhether the rewards of office are kept low by the democratic party, for\r\nthe sake of putting in what their opponents call 'adventurers,' or by\r\nthe aristocratic, with the hope of offices being engrossed by the men of\r\nprivate fortune. Let the true state of the case, according to each\r\nofficial's view of it, be presented to the people, rather than any\r\ncountenance be given to the present dreadful practice of wheedling and\r\nflattery; and the perils of office will be, by some means, lessened.\r\n\r\nThe popular scandal against the people of the United States, that they\r\nboast intolerably of their national institutions and character, appears\r\nto me untrue: but I see how it has arisen. Foreigners, especially the\r\nEnglish, are partly to blame for this. They enter the United States with\r\nan idea that a republic is a vulgar thing: and some take no pains to\r\nconceal their thought. To an American, nothing is more venerable than a\r\nrepublic. The native and the stranger set out on a misunderstanding. The\r\nEnglish attacks, the American defends, and, perhaps, boasts. But the\r\nvain-glorious flattery of their public orators is the more abundant\r\nsource of this reproach; and it rests with the people to redeem\r\nthemselves from it. For my own part, I remember no single instance of\r\npatriotic boasting, from man, woman, or child, except from the rostrum;\r\nbut from thence there was poured enough to spoil the auditory for life,\r\nif they had been simple enough to believe what they were told. But they\r\nwere not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the sinners of the rostrum, stand the sinners of the\r\nnewspaper press. The case is clear, and needs little remark or\r\nillustration. The profligacy of newspapers, wherever they exist, is a\r\nuniversal complaint; and, of all newspaper pressed I never heard any one\r\ndeny that the American is the worst. Of course, this depravity being so\r\ngeneral throughout the country, it must be occasioned by some\r\noverpowering force of circumstances. The causes are various; and it is a\r\ntestimony to the strength and purity of the democratic sentiment in the\r\ncountry, that the republic has not been overthrown by its newspapers.\r\n\r\nWhile the population is so scattered as it now is, throughout the\r\ngreater part of the Union, nothing is easier than to make the people\r\nknow only one side of a question; few things are easier than to keep\r\nfrom them altogether the knowledge of any particular affair; and, worse\r\nthan all, on them may easily be practised the discovery that lies may\r\nwork their intended effect, before the truth can overtake them.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell which is worst; the wide diffusion of things that are\r\nnot true, or the suppression of things that are true. It is no secret\r\nthat some able personage at Washington writes letters on the politics\r\nand politicians of the general government, and sends them to the\r\nremotest corners of the Union, to appear in their newspapers; after\r\nwhich, they are collected in the administration newspaper at Washington,\r\nas testimonies of public opinion in the respective districts where they\r\nappear. It is no secret that the newspapers of the south keep out of\r\ntheir columns all information which might enlighten their readers, near\r\nand afar, as to the real state of society at home. I can testify to the\r\n_remarkable events_ which occur in the southern States, unnoticed by any\r\npress, and transpiring only through accident. Two men were burned alive,\r\nwithout trial, by the gentlemen of Mobile, just before my arrival there;\r\nand no newspaper even alluded to the circumstance, till, many months\r\nafter, a brief and obscure paragraph, in a northern journal, treated it\r\nas a matter of hearsay.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that the systematic abuse with which the newspapers of\r\none side assail every candidate coming forward on the other, is the\r\ncause of many honourable men, who have a regard to their reputation,\r\nbeing deterred from entering public life; and of the people being thus\r\ndeprived of some better servants than any they have. Though a faithful\r\npublic servant should be able to endure all the consequences of faithful\r\nservice, yet there are many cases where men, undecided as to their\r\nchoice of public and private life, are fixed in favour of the latter by\r\nthis one circumstance. It is the one obstacle too much. A public man in\r\nNew England gave me the history of an editor of a newspaper, who began\r\nhis professional course by making an avowed distinction between telling\r\nlies in conversation and in a newspaper, where every body looks for\r\nthem. Of course, he has sunk deeper and deeper in falsehood; but\r\nretribution has not yet overtaken him. My informant told me, that this\r\neditor has made some thousands of dollars by his abuse of one man; and\r\njocosely proposed, that persons who are systematically railed at by any\r\nnewspaper, should lay claim to a proportion of the profits arising out\r\nof the use of their names and characters.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is, that the few exceptions to this depravity,--the few\r\nnewspapers conducted by men of truth and superior intelligence, are not\r\nyet encouraged in proportion to their merits. It is easy to see how a\r\nyouth, going into the wilds, to set up a newspaper for the neighbouring\r\nvillages, should meet with support, however vicious or crude his\r\nproduction maybe; but it is discouraging to perceive how little\r\npreference is given, in the Atlantic cities, to the best journals over\r\nthe worst. Still, there is a preference; and it appears to be on the\r\nincrease; and that increase, again, is in proportion to the intrepidity\r\nof the paper in discussing affairs as they arise.\r\n\r\nThere will be no great improvement in the literary character of the\r\nAmerican newspapers till the literature of the country has improved.\r\nTheir moral character depends upon the moral taste of the people. This\r\nlooks like a very severe censure. If it be so, the same censure applies\r\nelsewhere, and English morals must be held accountable for the slanders\r\nand captiousness displayed in the leading articles of British journals,\r\nand for the disgustingly jocose tone of their police reports, where\r\ncrimes are treated as entertainments, and misery as a jest. Whatever may\r\nbe the exterior causes of the Americans having been hitherto ill-served\r\nin their newspapers, it is now certain that there are none which may not\r\nbe overpowered by a sound moral taste. In their country, the demand lies\r\nwith the many. Whenever the many demand truth and justice in their\r\njournals, and reject falsehood and calumny, they will be served\r\naccording to their desire.\r\n\r\nThis desire is beginning to awaken. Some months before I left the\r\nUnited States, a man of colour was burned alive, without trial, at St.\r\nLouis, in Missouri; a large assemblage of the \"respectable\" inhabitants\r\nof the city being present. No one supposed that anybody out of the State\r\nof Missouri was any further implicated with this deed, than as men have\r\nan interest in every outrage done to man. The interest which residents\r\nin other States had in this deed, was like that which an Englishman has\r\nin a man being racked in the Spanish Inquisition; or a Frenchman, in a\r\nTurk being bastinadoed at Constantinople. He is not answerable for it,\r\nor implicated in it, as a fellow-citizen; and he speaks his humane\r\nreprobation as a fellow-man. Certain American citizens, out of Missouri,\r\ncontrived, however, to implicate themselves in the responsibility for\r\nthis awful outrage, which, one would have thought, any man would have\r\nbeen thankful to avoid. The majority of newspaper editors made\r\nthemselves parties to the act, by refusing, from fear, to reprobate it.\r\nThe state of the case was this, as described to me by some inhabitants\r\nof St. Louis. The gentlemen of the press in that city dared not\r\nreprobate the outrage, for fear of the consequences from the murderers.\r\nThey merely announced the deed, as a thing to be regretted, and\r\nrecommended that the veil of oblivion should be drawn over the affair.\r\nTheir hope was widely different from their recommendation. They hoped\r\nthat the newspapers throughout the Union would raise such a chorus of\r\nexecration as would annihilate the power of the executioners. But the\r\nnewspapers of the Union were afraid to comment upon the affair, because\r\nthey saw that the St. Louis editors were afraid. The really respectable\r\ninhabitants of that disgraced city were thrown almost into despair by\r\nthis dastardly silence, and believed all security of life and property\r\nin their State to be at an end. A few journals were honest enough to\r\nthunder the truth in the ears of the people; and the people awoke to\r\nperceive how their editors had involved themselves in this crime, by a\r\nvirtual acquiescence,--like the unfaithful mastiff, if such a creature\r\nthere be, which slinks away from its master's door, to allow a passage\r\nto a menacing thief. The influence of the will of the awakening people\r\nis already seen in the improved vigour in the tone of the newspapers\r\nagainst outrage. On occasion of the more recent riots at Cincinnati, the\r\neditorial silence has been broken by many voices.\r\n\r\nThere is a spirited newspaper at Louisville which has done its duty\r\nwell, on occasions when it required some courage to do it; informing the\r\nCincinnati people of the meanness of their conduct in repressing the\r\nexpression of opinion, lest it should injure the commerce between Ohio\r\nand Kentucky; and also, justifying Judge Shaw of Massachusetts, against\r\nthe outcries of the South, for a judgment he lately gave in favour of\r\nthe release of a slave, voluntarily carried into a free State. Two New\r\nYork papers, the New York American and the Evening Post, have gained\r\nthemselves honour by intrepidity of the same kind, and by the\r\ncomparative moderation and friendliness of their spirit. I hope that\r\nthere may be many more, and that their number may be perpetually on the\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nThe very best newspaper that I saw in the United States was a single\r\nnumber of the Cleveland Whig, which I picked up at an hotel in the\r\ninterior of Ohio. I had seen spirited extracts from it in various\r\nnewspapers. The whole of this particular number was valuable for the\r\nexcellence of its spirit, and for its good sense. It had very important,\r\nand some very painful subject matter,--instances of overbearing the\r\nlaw,--to treat of. It was so done as nearly to beguile me, hungry\r\ntraveller as I was, of my dinner, and of all thought of my journey.\r\n\r\nOne other remarkable paper lies before me: remarkable for its professing\r\nto be conducted on principles of exact justice, and for its accordance\r\nwith its principles to a degree which has hardly been dreamed of in a\r\npublication of its kind. There is something heroic in the enterprise,\r\nwhich inspires a strong hope of its success. If the ability be but\r\nsufficient to sustain it,--of which there seems no reason to\r\ndoubt,--there can be no question of its acceptableness. The just and\r\ngentle construction of human actions, and the cheerful and trustful mood\r\nin surveying natural events, are more congenial with the general mind,\r\nthan captiousness and distrust towards men, and despondency under the\r\ngovernment of God. Such men as the editor of the Boston Reformer are\r\nsure to command the sympathies of men, however they may appear to run\r\ncounter to the supposed tastes of newspaper readers. The following\r\nnotice to correspondents is a novelty in its place,--more striking than\r\nany announcements in the news columns.\r\n\r\n\"To correspondents.--Our paper is no vehicle of vulgar abuse, or\r\nspiteful attacks on persons or institutions. Our design is to avoid\r\neverything which appeals to or pleases any bad propensity in our nature.\r\nDoubtless there are a thousand petty annoyances somewhat grievous to be\r\nborne; but we cannot go about to redress them. The best way is to\r\nforgive and forget them. We cannot waste our strength on little matters.\r\nWe know no way to do good to man, to make society really better, but to\r\nsuppress our anger, keep our temper, show an elevated mind and a good\r\nheart. We must look for the good, not for the bad in men, and always\r\nput the best construction we can on all their doings.\"--_Boston\r\nReformer._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nAPATHY IN CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\nIn England the idea of an American citizen is of one who is always\r\ntalking politics, canvassing, bustling about to make proselytes abroad,\r\nburied in newspapers at home, and hurrying to vote on election days.\r\n\r\nThere is another side to the object. A learned professor of a western\r\ncollege told me abundance of English news, but declared himself ignorant\r\nof everything that had passed in the home portion of the political\r\nworld. He never took any interest in politics. What would be the use of\r\nhis disturbing himself? How far does one man's vote go? He does more\r\ngood by showing himself above such affairs.\r\n\r\nIt was communicated to me that there are more modes of political action\r\nthan one: and that, though this professor does not vote, he uses his\r\nutmost influence with the students of his college, in favour of his own\r\npolitical opinions; and with entire success. If this be true, the\r\ngentleman falls short of his duty in one respect, and exceeds it in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nA clergyman in the north was anxious to assure me that elections are\r\nmerely personal matters, and do not affect the happiness of the people.\r\nIt matters not to him, for instance, who is in office, and what party in\r\npolitics is uppermost: life goes on the same to him. This gentleman had\r\nprobably never heard of the old lady who said that she did not care\r\nwhat revolutions happened, as long as she had her roast chicken, and her\r\nlittle game at cards. But that old lady did not live in a republic, or\r\nperhaps even she might have perceived that there would have been no\r\nsecurity for roast chickens and cards, if all were to neglect political\r\naction but those who want political power and profit. In a democracy,\r\nevery man is supposed to be his own security for life and property: and,\r\nif a man devolves his political charge upon others, he must lay his\r\naccounts for not being so well taken care of as he might be. So much for\r\nthe selfish aspect of the case;--the view which might have been\r\npresented, with illustrations, to the old lady, if she had happened to\r\nlive in a republic.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman ought to see further. He ought to see, in virtue of his\r\noffice, how public morals must suffer under the neglect of public duty\r\nby respectable men. If such men were to perform the duties of citizens\r\nas conscientiously as they do those of husbands, fathers, and pastors,\r\nand leave it to the knaves to neglect the duties of citizenship, the\r\nrepublic might go on as well as a republic with knaves in it can go on.\r\nBut if the case is reversed,--if the knaves are eager to use their\r\npolitical rights for selfish purposes, and the conscientious in other\r\nrespects are remiss in the duties of citizenship, the pastors may almost\r\nas well leave off preaching. All good pastoral influence will be borne\r\ndown by the spread of corruption. The clergy may preach themselves\r\nhoarse to little purpose, if they live, and encourage others to live, in\r\nthe avowed neglect of the first duty of any one relation; and the\r\nexercise of the suffrage is the first duty of republican citizenship.\r\n\r\nA naval officer, a man of an otherwise sound head and heart, told me,\r\nvery coolly, that he had never voted more than twice in his life. His\r\ndefence, in answer to my remonstrance, was, that he had served his\r\ncountry in other ways. In as far as this might be meant to convey that\r\nhe could not vote at New York when in India, the excuse must be admitted\r\nas valid: but, if it was meant to apply to elections going on before his\r\neyes, it was much the same as if he had said, \"there is no occasion for\r\nme to be a good father, because I have been a good son.\"\r\n\r\nA member of Congress gave me instances of what would have been the\r\nmodifications of certain public affairs, but for the apathy of the\r\nminority about the use of their suffrage. If citizens regulate their\r\nexertions by the probabilities of immediate success, instead of by their\r\nfaith in their own convictions, it is indeed no wonder if the minority\r\nleave everything to their adversaries; but this is not the way for men\r\nto show themselves worthy of the possession of political rights. This is\r\nnot the way that society has advanced. This is not the way that security\r\nfor life and property has been obtained for those idle citizens who are\r\nnow leaving that security to the mercy of those whom they believe to be\r\nthe enemies of society.\r\n\r\nA public man told me that it would be a great point gained, if every\r\ncitizen could be induced to vote, at least once a year. So far is it\r\nfrom being true that all Americans are the bustling politicians the\r\nEnglish have been apt to suppose. If such political bustle should be\r\nabsurd, the actual apathy is something worse. If it were only borne in\r\nmind that rulers derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned, surely all conscientious men would see the guilt of any man\r\nacquiescing in the rule of governors whom he disapproves, by not having\r\nrecorded his dissent. Or, if he should be in the majority, the case is\r\nno better. He has omitted to bear his testimony to what he esteems the\r\ntrue principles of government. He has not appointed his rulers; and, in\r\nas far as he accepts their protection, he takes without having given, he\r\nreaps without having sown; he deprives his just rulers of a portion of\r\nthe authority which is their due--of a portion of the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nThere is another cause for the reluctance to vote which is complained of\r\nby the best friends of the people; but it is almost too humbling and\r\npainful to be discussed. Some are afraid to vote!\r\n\r\nThis happens not in the country, nor among the strength of the\r\npopulation in the towns: but among the feeble aristocracy. There is not,\r\nin the United States, as with us, a system of intimidation exercised by\r\nthe rich over the poor. In the country, there are no landlords and\r\ntenants at will. In the towns, the tradesmen do not stand in need of the\r\npatronage of the rich. Though they vote by ballot, and any man who\r\nchooses it may vote secretly, (and many do upon occasion,) there is\r\nrarely any need of such protection. But there is no reason why the\r\ngentry, who may be afraid of hurting one another's feelings, should not\r\nuse their power of secret voting, rather than neglect the duty of giving\r\ntheir suffrage. If the educated and principled men of the community, as\r\nthey are esteemed, fall back into idleness and silence, when the time\r\ncomes for a struggle for principles, and there is a danger of\r\ndisappointing expectations, and hurting feelings, their country has\r\nlittle to thank them for. They are the men from whom the open discharge\r\nof duty is looked for; they are the men who should show that political\r\nobligation is above private regards. If they have not the virtue to do\r\nthis, and take the consequences, let them avail themselves of the\r\nsecrecy of the ballot-box, which in England is desired for the\r\nprotection of those whom bad arrangements have made dependent for bread\r\non the rich and powerful. At all events, let them vote, or be ashamed to\r\naccept the privileges of citizenship without having discharged the\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe fear of opinion sometimes takes the form of an almost insane dread\r\nof responsibility. There are occasions when public men, unable to judge\r\nfor themselves of particular classes of circumstances, are obliged to\r\nask advice of their friends and supporters. Happy he who obtains a full\r\nand true answer from any one! The chances against this are in proportion\r\nto the importance of the case. I knew of one such instance, the result\r\nof which more than one is, I trust, now grieving over in his inmost\r\nheart. An eminent statesman was hesitating whether to offer himself as a\r\ncandidate for a very high office. He requested the opinion and advice of\r\na number of gentlemen in public life, his supporters. All were of the\r\nsame opinion; that he should not stand. No one of them chose to take the\r\nresponsibility of telling him so. Some of them wrote ambiguous answers,\r\nhoping that he would infer that they thought ill of his chance. Others\r\nrather encouraged the enterprise. The illustrative details which might\r\nbe given,--showing the general uniformity, with particular diversity, of\r\nthe conduct of the advisers,--would be amusing if they were not too sad.\r\nSuffice it that no one, as far as I could learn, could get over his fear\r\nof responsibility so as to be faithful. They allowed their idol to make\r\na fool of himself. If he should henceforth be sunk in political\r\nscepticism, perhaps these gentlemen may find that in shunning one kind\r\nof responsibility, they have incurred another, far heavier.\r\n\r\nIt is felt, and understood, in the United States, that their near future\r\nin politics is indiscernible. Odd, unexpected circumstances,\r\ndetermining the present, are perpetually turning up. Almost every man\r\nhas his convictions as to what the state of affairs will be, in the\r\ngross, a century hence. Scarcely any man will venture a conjecture as to\r\nwhat will have happened next spring. This is the very condition, if the\r\npeople could but see it, for the exercise of faith in principles. With a\r\ndark and shifting near future, and a bright and fixed ultimate destiny,\r\nwhat is the true, the only wisdom? Not to pry into the fogs and thickets\r\nround about, or to stand still for fear of what may next occur in the\r\npath; but to look from Eden gate behind to heaven gate before, and press\r\non to the certain future. In his political as in his moral life, man\r\nshould, in the depth of his ignorance and the fallibility of his\r\njudgment, throw himself, in a full sense of security, upon principles;\r\nand then he is safe from being depressed by opposition, or scared by\r\nuncertainty, or depraved by responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nALLEGIANCE TO LAW.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that there is a remarkable failure in this department of\r\npolitical morals among certain parties in the United States. The mobbing\r\nevents of the last few years are celebrated; the abolition riots in New\r\nYork and Boston; the burning of the Charleston Convent; the bank riots\r\nat Baltimore; the burning of the mails at Charleston; the hangings by\r\nLynch-law at Vickesburgh; the burning alive of a man of colour at St.\r\nLouis; the subsequent proceedings there towards the students of Marion\r\nCollege; and the abolition riots at Cincinnati. Here is a fearful list!\r\n\r\nThe first question that arises is, who has done these things? Whose\r\nhands have lighted green fagots round a living man? and strung up a\r\ndozen or twenty citizens on the same gallows? and fired and razed\r\nhouses; and sent a company of trembling nuns flying for their lives at\r\nmidnight? Here is evidence enough of ignorance,--of desperate, brutal\r\nignorance. Whose ignorance?\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the instantaneous and natural persuasion of men who hear the\r\ntidings is, that the lowest classes in America have risen against the\r\nhigher. In Europe, desperate, brutal ignorance is the deepest curse in\r\nthe cursed life of the pauper and the serf. In Europe, mobbing is\r\nusually the outbreak of exasperated misery against laws which oppress,\r\nand an aristocracy which insults humanity. Europeans, therefore,\r\nnaturally assume that the gentry of the United States are the sinned\r\nagainst, and the poor the sinners, in their social disturbances. They\r\ndraw conclusions against popular government, and suppose it proved that\r\nuniversal suffrage dissolves society into chaos. They picture to\r\nthemselves a rabble of ragged, desperate workmen, with torches in their\r\nhands; while the gentry look on in dismay, or tremble within their\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nIt is not so. I was informed, twenty times over, by gentlemen, that the\r\nBoston mob of last year was wholly composed of gentlemen. The only\r\nworking man in it was the truck-man who saved the victim. They were the\r\ngentlemen of St. Louis who burned the black man, and banished the\r\nstudents of Marion College. They were the gentlemen of Cincinnati who\r\ndenounced the abolitionists, and raised the persecution against them.\r\nThey were the magistrates and gentry of Vickesburgh who hanged\r\nway-farers, gamblers, and slaves in a long row. They were the gentlemen\r\nof Charleston who broke open the Post Office, and violated its sacred\r\nfunction, to the insult and injury of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe case is plain. There are no paupers to rise against oppressive laws\r\nin a country, where the laws are made by all, and where pauperism is\r\nthereby excluded. There is no degraded class, subject to insults from\r\nthe highest, which can be resented only by outrage. The assumption is a\r\nfalse one, that ignorance and poverty, knowledge and wealth, go\r\ntogether. Mobbing for European causes, and in European modes, is\r\nabsolutely precluded where political rights are universal, and political\r\npower equally diffused through all classes.\r\n\r\nThe very few European causes which are in analogy with United States\r\nmobbing, are those riots for opinion, which bear only a subordinate\r\nrelation to politics; such as the Birmingham riots, and the attempt of\r\nthe Liverpool merchants to push Clarkson into the dock. The cases are\r\nvery similar. The mobs of America are composed of high churchmen, (of\r\nwhatever denomination,) merchants and planters, and lawyers.\r\n\r\nOne complete narrative of a riot, for the fidelity of which I can vouch,\r\nwill expose the truth of the case better than a list of deeds of horror\r\nwhich happened beyond my sight. It is least revolting, too, to treat of\r\na case whose terror lies in its existence, more than in its\r\nconsequences. The actors in the riot, which it was my fortune to\r\nunderstand, were scarcely less guilty than if they had bathed their\r\nhands in blood; but it is easier to examine, undisturbed by passion, the\r\ncase of those whose hands are, to the outward eye, clean.\r\n\r\nA very few years ago, certain citizens in New England began to discover\r\nthat the planters of the south were making white slaves in the north,\r\nnearly as successfully as they were propagating black slavery in the\r\nterritories of the south and west. Charleston and Boston were\r\naffectionate friends in old times, and are so still, notwithstanding the\r\nhard words that passed between them in nullification days: that is, the\r\nmerchants and professional men of Boston are fond of Charleston, on\r\naccount of their commercial relations. This attachment has been carried\r\nto such an extreme as to be almost fatal to the liberties of some of the\r\nbest citizens of the northern city. They found their brothers dismissed\r\nfrom their pastoral charges, their sons expelled from colleges, their\r\nfriends excluded from professorships, and themselves debarred from\r\nliterary and social privileges, if they happened to entertain and\r\nexpress opinions unfavourable to the peculiar domestic institution by\r\nwhich Charleston declares it to be her intention to abide. Such is the\r\nplea of those citizens of Boston who have formed associations for the\r\npurpose of opposing, by moral influence, an institution which they feel\r\nto be inconsistent with the first principles of morals and politics. For\r\na considerable time before my visit to that part of the country, they\r\nhad encountered petty persecutions of almost every conceivable kind.\r\nThere is no law in Massachusetts by which the free expression of opinion\r\non moral subjects is punishable. I heard many regret the absence of such\r\nlaw. Everything was done that could be done to make up for its absence.\r\nBooks on any subject, written by persons who avow by association their\r\nbad opinion of slavery, are not purchased: clergymen are no longer\r\ninvited to preach: the proprietors of public rooms will not let them to\r\nmembers of such associations; and the churches are shut against them.\r\nTheir notices of public meetings are torn in the pulpits, while all\r\nnotices of other public meetings are read. The newspapers pour contempt\r\nand wrath upon them in one continued stream. Bad practices are imputed\r\nto them, and their denial is drowned in clamour. As a single instance of\r\nthis last; I was told so universally in the south and west that the\r\nabolitionists of Boston and New York were in the habit of sending\r\nincendiary tracts among the slaves, that it never occurred to me to\r\ndoubt the fact; though I was struck with surprise at never being able to\r\nfind any one who had seen any one who had actually seen one of these\r\ntracts. Nor did it occur to me that as slaves cannot read, verbal\r\nmessages would be more to the purpose of all parties, as being more\r\neffectual and more prudent. Mr. Madison made the charge, so did Mr.\r\nClay, so did Mr. Calhoun, so did every slave-holder and merchant with\r\nwhom I conversed. I chose afterwards to hear the other side of the whole\r\nquestion; and I found, to my amazement, that this charge was wholly\r\ngroundless. No Abolition Society of New York or Massachusetts has ever\r\nsent any anti-slavery paper south of Washington, except the circulars,\r\naddressed to public officers in the States, which were burnt at\r\nCharleston. The abolitionists of Boston have been denying this charge\r\never since it was first made, and offering evidence of its\r\ngroundlessness; yet the calumny is persisted in, and, no doubt, honestly\r\nbelieved, to this hour, throughout the south, whither the voice of the\r\ncondemned, stifled by their fellow-citizens, cannot reach.\r\n\r\nOnly mortal things, however, can be really suffocated; and there has\r\nnever yet been an instance of a murder of opinion. There seemed, in\r\n1835, so much danger of the abolitionists making themselves heard, that\r\nan emphatic contradiction was got up, it was hoped in good time.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists had been, they believe illegally, denied by the city\r\nauthority the use of Faneuil Hall; (called, in memory of revolutionary\r\ndays, the \"Cradle of Liberty.\") Certain merchants and lawyers of Boston\r\nheld a meeting there, in August, 1835, for the purpose of reprobating\r\nthe meetings of the abolitionists, and denouncing their measures, while\r\napproving of their principles. The less that is said of this\r\nmeeting,--the deepest of all the disgraces of Boston,--the better. It\r\nbears its character in its face. Its avowed object was to put down the\r\nexpression of opinion by opprobrium, in the absence of gag laws. Of the\r\nfifteen hundred who signed the requisition for this meeting, there are\r\nmany, especially among the younger and more thoughtless, who have long\r\nrepented of the deed. Some signed in anger; some in fear; many in\r\nmistake; and of each of these there are some, who would fain, if it were\r\npossible, efface their signatures with their blood.\r\n\r\nIt is an invariable fact, and recognized as such, that meetings held to\r\nsupply the deficiency of gag laws are the prelude to the violence which\r\nsupplies the deficiency of executioners under such laws. Every meeting\r\nheld to denounce opinion is followed by a mob. This was so well\r\nunderstood in the present case that the abolitionists were warned that\r\nif they met again publicly, they would be answerable for the disorders\r\nthat might ensue. The abolitionists pleaded that this was like making\r\nthe rich man answerable for the crime of the thief who robbed him, on\r\nthe ground that if the honest man had not been rich, the thief would not\r\nhave been tempted to rob him. The abolitionists also perceived how\r\nliberty of opinion and of speech depended on their conduct in this\r\ncrisis; and they resolved to yield to no threats of illegal violence;\r\nbut to hold their legal meeting, pursuant to advertisement, for the\r\ndespatch of their usual business. One remarkable feature of the case was\r\nthat this heavy responsibility rested upon women. It was a ladies'\r\nmeeting that was in question. Upon consultation, the ladies agreed that\r\nthey should never have sought the perilous duty of defending liberty of\r\nopinion and speech at the last crisis; but, as such a service seemed\r\nmanifestly appointed to them, the women were ready.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of October, they met, pursuant to advertisement, at the\r\noffice of their association, No. 46, Washington Street. Twenty-five\r\nreached their room, by going three-quarters of an hour before the\r\nappointed time. Five more made their way up with difficulty through the\r\ncrowd. A hundred more were turned back by the mob.\r\n\r\nThey knew that a hand-bill had been circulated on the Exchange, and\r\nposted on the City Hall, and throughout the city, the day before, which\r\ndeclared that Thompson, the abolitionist, was to address them; and\r\ninvited the citizens, under promise of pecuniary reward, to \"snake\r\nThompson out, and bring him to the tar-kettle before dark.\" The ladies\r\nhad been warned that they would be killed, \"as sure as fate,\" if they\r\nshowed themselves on their own premises that day. They therefore\r\ninformed the mayor that they expected to be attacked. The reply of the\r\ncity marshal was, \"You give us a great deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee-room was surrounded, and gazed into by a howling,\r\nshrieking mob of gentlemen, while the twenty-five ladies sat perfectly\r\nstill, awaiting the striking of the clock. When it struck, they opened\r\ntheir meeting. They were questioned as to whether Thompson was there in\r\ndisguise; to which they made no reply.\r\n\r\nThey began, as usual, with prayer; the mob shouting \"Hurra! here comes\r\nJudge Lynch!\" Before they had done, the partition gave way, and the\r\ngentlemen hurled missiles at the lady who was presiding. The secretary\r\nhaving risen, and begun to read her report, rendered inaudible by the\r\nuproar, the mayor entered, and insisted upon their going home, to save\r\ntheir lives. The purpose of their meeting was answered: they had\r\nasserted their principle; and they now passed out, two and two, amidst\r\nthe execration of some thousands of gentlemen;--persons who had silver\r\nshrines to protect. The ladies, to the number of fifty, walked to the\r\nhouse of one of their members, and were presently struck to the heart by\r\nthe news that Garrison was in the hands of the mob. Garrison is the\r\nchief apostle of abolition in the United States. He had escorted his\r\nwife to the meeting; and, after offering to address the ladies, and\r\nbeing refused, out of regard to his safety, had left the room, and, as\r\nthey supposed, the premises. He was, however, in the house when the\r\nladies left it. He was hunted for by the mob; dragged from behind some\r\nplanks where he had taken refuge, and conveyed into the street. Here his\r\nhat was trampled under-foot, and brick-bats were aimed at his bare head;\r\na rope was tied round him, and thus he was dragged through the streets.\r\nHis young wife saw all this. Her exclamation was, \"I think my husband\r\nwill be true to his principles. I am sure my husband will not deny his\r\nprinciples.\" Her confidence was just. Garrison never denies his\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nHe was saved by a stout truckman, who, with his bludgeon, made his way\r\ninto the crowd, as if to attack the victim. He protected the bare head,\r\nand pushed on towards a station house, whence the mayor's officers\r\nissued, and pulled in Garrison, who was afterwards put into a coach. The\r\nmob tried to upset the coach, and throw down the horses; but the driver\r\nlaid about him with his whip, and the constables with their staves, and\r\nGarrison was safely lodged in jail: for protection; for he had committed\r\nno offence.\r\n\r\nBefore the mayor ascended the stairs to dismiss the ladies, he had done\r\na very remarkable deed;--he had given permission to two gentlemen to\r\npull down and destroy the anti-slavery sign, bearing the inscription,\r\n\"Anti-Slavery Office,\"--which had hung for two years, as signs do hang\r\nbefore public offices in Boston. The plea of the mayor is, that he hoped\r\nthe rage of the mob would thus be appeased: that is, he gave them leave\r\nto break the laws in one way, lest they should in another. The citizens\r\nfollowed up this deed of the mayor with one no less remarkable. They\r\nelected these two rioters members of the State legislature, by a large\r\nmajority, within ten days.\r\n\r\nI passed through the mob some time after it had begun to assemble. I\r\nasked my fellow-passengers in the stage what it meant. They supposed it\r\nwas a busy foreign-post day, and that this occasioned an assemblage of\r\ngentlemen about the post-office. They pointed out to me that there were\r\nnone but gentlemen. We were passing through from Salem, fifteen miles\r\nnorth of Boston, to Providence, Rhode Island; and were therefore\r\nuninformed of the events and expectations of the day. On the morrow, a\r\nvisitor who arrived at Providence from Boston told us the story; and I\r\nhad thenceforth an excellent opportunity of hearing all the remarks that\r\ncould be made by persons of all ways of thinking and feeling, on this\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nIt excited much less attention than it deserved; less than would be\r\nbelieved possible by those at a distance who think more seriously of\r\npersecution for opinion, and less tenderly of slavery than a great many\r\nof the citizens of Boston. To many in the city of Boston the story I\r\nhave told would be news: and to yet more in the country, who know that\r\nsome trouble was caused by abolition meetings in the city, but who are\r\nnot aware that their own will, embodied in the laws, was overborne to\r\ngratify the mercenary interests of a few, and the political fears of a\r\nfew more.\r\n\r\nThe first person with whom I conversed about this riot was the president\r\nof a university. We were perfectly agreed as to the causes and character\r\nof the outrage. This gentleman went over to Boston for a day or two; and\r\nwhen he returned, I saw him again. He said he was happy to tell me that\r\nwe had been needlessly making ourselves uneasy about the affair: that\r\nthere had been no mob, the persons assembled having been all gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAn eminent lawyer at Boston was one of the next to speak upon it. \"O,\r\nthere was no mob,\" said he. \"I was there myself, and saw they were all\r\ngentlemen. They were all in fine broad-cloth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the less a mob for that,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they protected Garrison. He received no harm. They protected\r\nGarrison.\"\r\n\r\n\"From whom, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, they would not really hurt him. They only wanted to show that they\r\nwould not have such a person live among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should not he live among them? Is he guilty under any law?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is an insufferable person to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"So may you be to-morrow. If you can catch Garrison breaking the laws,\r\npunish him under the laws. If you cannot, he has as much right to live\r\nwhere he pleases as you.\"\r\n\r\nTwo law pupils of this gentleman presently entered. One approved of all\r\nthat had been done, and praised the spirit of the gentlemen of Boston. I\r\nasked whether they had not broken the law. Yes. I asked him if he knew\r\nwhat the law was. Yes; but it could not be always kept. If a man was\r\ncaught in a house setting it on fire, the owner might shoot him; and\r\nGarrison was such an incendiary. I asked him for proof. He had nothing\r\nbut hearsay to give. The case, as I told him, came to this. A. says\r\nGarrison is an incendiary. B. says he is not. A. proceeds on his own\r\nopinion to break the law, lest Garrison should do so.\r\n\r\nThe other pupil told me of the sorrow of heart with which he saw the\r\nlaw, the life of the republic, set at naught by those who should best\r\nunderstand its nature and value. He saw that the time was come for the\r\ntrue men of the republic to oppose a bold front to the insolence of the\r\nrich and the powerful, who were bearing down the liberties of the people\r\nfor a matter of opinion. The young men, he saw, must brace themselves up\r\nagainst the tyranny of the monied mob, and defend the law; or the\r\nliberties of the country were gone. I afterwards found many such among\r\nthe young men of the wealthier classes. If they keep their convictions,\r\nthey and their city are safe.\r\n\r\nNo prosecutions followed. I asked a lawyer, an abolitionist, why. He\r\nsaid there would be difficulty in getting a verdict; and, if it was\r\nobtained, the punishment would be merely a fine, which would be paid on\r\nthe spot, and the triumph would remain with the aggressors. This seemed\r\nto me no good reason.\r\n\r\nI asked an eminent judge the same question; and whether there was not a\r\npublic prosecutor who might prosecute for breach of the peace, if the\r\nabolitionists would not, for the assault on Garrison. He said it might\r\nbe done; but he had given his advice against it. Why? The feeling was so\r\nstrong against the abolitionists,--the rioters were so respectable in\r\nthe city,--it was better to let the whole affair pass over without\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nOf others, some knew nothing of it, because it was about such a low set\r\nof people; some could not take any interest in what they were tired of\r\nhearing about; some had not heard anything of the matter; some thought\r\nthe abolitionists were served quite right; some were sure the gentlemen\r\nof Boston would not do anything improper; and some owned that there was\r\nsuch bad taste and meddlesomeness in the abolitionists, that people of\r\ntaste kept out of the way of hearing anything about them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, the body of the people are sound. Many of the\r\nyoung lawyers are resolved to keep on the watch, to maintain the rights\r\nof the abolitionists in the legislature, and in the streets of the city.\r\nMany hundreds of the working men agreed to leave their work on the first\r\nrumour of riot, get sworn in as special constables, and keep the peace\r\nagainst the gentry; acting vigorously against the mob ringleaders, if\r\nsuch should be the magistrates of Boston themselves. I visited many of\r\nthe villages in Massachusetts; and there everything seemed right. The\r\ncountry people are abolitionists, by nature and education, and they see\r\nthe iniquity of mob-law. A sagacious gentleman told me that it did him\r\ngood to hear, in New York, of this mob, because it proved the rest of\r\nMassachusetts to be in a sound state. It is always 'Boston _versus_\r\nMassachusetts;' and when the city, or the aristocracy there, who think\r\nthemselves the city, are very vehemently wrong, it is a plain proof that\r\nthe country people are eminently right. This may, for the humour of the\r\nthing, be strongly put; but there is much truth in it.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the case is very easy to understand; and supremely\r\nimportant to be understood.\r\n\r\nThe law, in a republic, is the embodiment of the will of the people. As\r\nlong as the republic is in a natural and healthy state, containing no\r\nanomaly, and exhibiting no gross vices, the function of the law works\r\neasily, and is understood and reverenced. Its punishments bear only upon\r\nindividuals, who have the opposition of society to contend with for\r\nviolating its will, and who are helpless against the righteous\r\nvisitations of the law.\r\n\r\nIf there be any anomaly among the institutions of a republic, the\r\nfunction of the law is certain to be disturbed, sooner or later: and\r\nthat disturbance is usually the symptom by the exhibition of which the\r\nanomaly is first detected, and then cured. It was so with free-masonry.\r\nIt will be so with slavery; and with every institution inconsistent with\r\nthe fundamental principles of democracy. The process is easily\r\ntraceable. The worldly interests of the minority,--of perhaps a single\r\nclass,--are bound up with the anomaly:--of the minority, because, if the\r\nmajority had been interested in any anti-republican institution, the\r\nrepublic would not have existed. The minority may go on for a length of\r\ntime in apparent harmony with the expressed will of the many,--the law.\r\nBut the time comes when their anomaly clashes with the law. For\r\ninstance, the merchants of the north trade in products which are, as\r\nthey believe, created out of a denial that all men are born free and\r\nequal, and that the just powers of rulers are derived from the consent\r\nof the governed; while the contrary principles are the root which\r\nproduces the law. Which is to be given up, when both cannot be held? If\r\nthe pecuniary interest of merchants is incompatible with freedom of\r\nspeech in fellow-citizens, which is to suffer?--The will of the\r\nmajority, the lawmaker, is to decide. But it takes some time to awaken\r\nthe will of the majority; and till it awakes, the interest of the\r\nfaction is active, and overbears the law. The retribution is certain;\r\nthe result is safe. But the evils meanwhile are so tremendous, that no\r\nexertion should be spared to open the eyes of the majority to the\r\ninsults offered to its will. There is no fear that the majority will\r\nultimately succumb to the minority,--the harmonious law to the\r\ndiscordant anomaly: but it is a fearful thing, meantime, that the brave\r\nshould be oppressed by the mercenary, and oppressed in proportion to\r\ntheir bravery; that the masters of black slaves in the south should be\r\nallowed to make white slaves in the north; that power and wealth should\r\nbe used to blind the people to the nature and dignity of the law, and to\r\nseduce them into a preference of brute force. These evils are so\r\ntremendous as to make it the duty of every citizen to bring every\r\nlawbreaker, high or low, to punishment; to strike out of the election\r\nlist every man who tampers with the will of the majority; to teach every\r\nchild what the law is, and why it must be maintained; to keep his eye on\r\nthe rostrum, the bench, the bar, the pulpit, the press, the lyceum, the\r\nschool, that no fallacy, no compromise with an anomaly, no surrender of\r\nprinciple be allowed to pass unexposed and unstigmatized.\r\n\r\nOne compound fallacy is allowed daily to pass unexposed and\r\nunstigmatized. \"You make no allowance,\" said a friend who was strangely\r\nbewildered by it,--\"you make no allowance for the great number of\r\nexcellent people who view the anomaly and the law as you do, but who\r\nkeep quiet, because they sincerely believe that by speaking and acting\r\nthey should endanger the Union.\" This explains the conduct of a crowd of\r\n\"excellent people,\" neither merchants, nor the friends of slave-holders,\r\nnor approving slavery, or mobbing, or persecution for opinion; but who\r\nrevile or satirize the abolitionists, and, for the rest, hold their\r\ntongues. But is it possible that such do not see that if slavery be\r\nwrong, and if it be indeed bound up with the Union, the Union must fall?\r\nIs it possible that they do not see that if the question be really\r\nthis,--that if the laws of God and the arrangements of man are\r\nincompatible, man's arrangements must give way?--I regard it as a false\r\nand mischievous assumption that slavery is bound up with the Union: but\r\nif I believed the dictum, I should not be for \"putting off the evil\r\nday.\" Every day which passes over the unredressed wrongs of any class\r\nwhich a republic holds in her bosom; every day which brings persecution\r\non those who act out the principles which all profess; every day which\r\nadds a sanction to brute force, and impairs the sacredness of law; every\r\nday which prolongs impunity to the oppressor and discouragement to the\r\noppressed, is a more evil day than that which should usher in the work\r\nof renovation.\r\n\r\nBut the dictum is not true. This bitter satire upon the constitution,\r\nand upon all who have complacently lived under it, is not true. The\r\nUnion is not incompatible with freedom of speech. The Union does not\r\nforbid men to act according to their convictions. The Union has never\r\ndepended for its existence on hypocrisy, insult, and injury; and it\r\nnever will.\r\n\r\nLet citizens but take heed individually to respect the law, and see that\r\nothers do,--that no neighbour transgresses it, that no statesman\r\ndespises it unrebuked, that no child grows up ignorant or careless of\r\nit; and the Union is as secure as the ground they tread upon. If this be\r\nnot done, everything is in peril, for the season; not only the Union,\r\nbut property, home, life and integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nSECTIONAL PREJUDICE.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice at Washington to pay the Members of Congress, not\r\nonly a per diem allowance, but their travelling expenses; at so much per\r\ntwenty miles. Two Members of Congress from Missouri made charges widely\r\ndifferent in amount. Complaints were made that the Members were not\r\nconfined to a mail route, and that the country had to pay for any\r\ndigressions the honourable gentlemen might be in the humour to make.\r\nUpon this, a Member observed that, so far from wishing to confine the\r\ncongressional travellers to a mail route, he would, if possible,\r\nprescribe the condition that they should travel, both in coming and\r\ngoing, through every State of the Union. Any money thus expended, would\r\nbe, he considered, a cheap price to pay for the conquest of prejudices\r\nand dispersion of unfriendly feelings, which would be the consequence of\r\nthe rambles he proposed.\r\n\r\nThe Members of Congress from the north like to revert to the day when\r\nthere were only two universities, Harvard and Yale, to which all the\r\nyouth of the Union repaired for education. The southern members love to\r\nboast of the increase of colleges, so that every State will soon be\r\neducating its own youth. The northern men miss the sweet sounds of\r\nacknowledgment which used to meet their ears, as often as past days were\r\nreferred to--the grateful mention of the New England retreats where the\r\nyears of preparation for active life were spent. The southern men are\r\nmortified at the supposition that everything intellectual must come out\r\nof New England. When they boast that Virginia has produced almost all\r\ntheir Presidents, they are met by the boast that New England has\r\nfurnished almost all the school-masters, professors, and clergy of the\r\ncountry. While the north is still fostering a reverence for the Union,\r\nthe south loses no opportunity of enlarging lovingly on the virtue of\r\npassionate attachment to one's native state.\r\n\r\nThere is much nature and much reason in all this. It is true that there\r\nis advantage in the youth of the whole country being brought together\r\nwithin college walls, at the age when warm friendships are formed. They\r\ncan hardly quarrel very desperately in Congress, after having striven,\r\nand loved, and learned together, in their bright early days. The cadets\r\nat West Point spoke warmly to me of this. They told me that when a youth\r\nis coming from afar, the youths who have arrived from an opposite point\r\nof the compass prepare to look cold upon him and quiz him, and receive\r\nhim frigidly enough; but the second Sunday seldom comes round before\r\nthey wonder at him and themselves, and acknowledge that he might almost\r\nhave been born in their own State. On the other hand, it is true that it\r\nwould be an absurdity and a hardship to the dwellers in the south and\r\nwest to have no means of educating their youth at home; but to be\r\nobliged to send them a thousand miles in pursuit of necessary learning.\r\nIt is also true that medical colleges should abound; that peculiar\r\ndiseases, incident to climate and locality, may be studied on the spot.\r\nIn this, as in many other cases, some good must be sacrificed for the\r\nattainment of a greater good.\r\n\r\nThe question is, need sectional prejudices increase under the new\r\narrangements? Are there no means of counteracting this great evil,\r\nexcept the ancient methods? Is West Point the last spot whereon common\r\ninterests may rally, and whence state jealousies may be excluded?\r\n\r\nI should be sorry if the answer were unfavourable; for this Sectional\r\nPrejudice, carried beyond the point of due political vigilance, is\r\nfolly,--childish folly. Events prove it to be so. Deadly political\r\nenemies meet at Washington, and snarl and declaim at one another with\r\nmighty fierceness. They find themselves, some sunny day, lying on the\r\ngrass under the shade of a tree, at the country-house of an\r\nacquaintance; they rise up cordial friends. They have actually discussed\r\nthe question of questions, the American System and Nullification; and\r\nyet they rise up cordial friends. Again; a Boston gentleman and his lady\r\ntravel for health through the south and west. They hear abuse of their\r\nState and city in abundance by the roadside; but their hearts are\r\ntouched by the hospitality and friendliness they meet under every roof.\r\nAgain; the planter carries his family to a Rhode Island bathing place,\r\nfor the hot season: and there he finds some to whom he can open his\r\nheart about his domestic troubles, caused by slavery; he gains their\r\nsympathy, and carries away their esteem. The sectional hatred, if not an\r\nabstraction, is founded mainly on abstractions, and gives way at once\r\nwhen the parties are confronted. Does it not deserve to be called\r\nchildish folly?\r\n\r\nYet \"hatred\" is not too strong a term for this sectional prejudice. Many\r\na time in America have I been conscious of that pang and shudder which\r\nare felt only in the presence of hatred. I question whether the enmity\r\nbetween the British and the Americans, at the most exasperating crisis\r\nof the war, could ever have been more intense than some that I have seen\r\nflashing in the eyes, and heard from the lips, of Americans against\r\nfellow-citizens in distant sections of their country. I have scarcely\r\nknown whether to laugh or to mourn when I have been told that the New\r\nEngland people are all pedlars or canting priests; that the people of\r\nthe south are all heathens; and those of the west all barbarians. Nay, I\r\nwas even told in New York that the Rhode Island people were all\r\nheathens, and the New Jersey folks no better. Some Baltimore ladies told\r\nme that the Philadelphia ladies say that no Baltimore lady knows how to\r\nput on a bonnet: but that the Philadelphians have something worse the\r\nmatter with them than that; for that they do not know how to be\r\nhospitable to strangers. Without stopping to settle which is the gravest\r\nof these heavy charges, I am anxious to bear my testimony against the\r\ncorrectness of either. I saw some pretty bonnets, most becomingly worn,\r\nat Baltimore; and I can speak confidently to the hospitality of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nTrifling as some instances appear of the manifestation of this puerile\r\nspirit, it sometimes, it always, issues in results which are no\r\ntrifle;--always, because the spirit of jealousy is a deadly curse to him\r\nwho is possessed by it, whether it be founded on fact, or no. It cannot\r\nco-exist with a generous patriotism, one essential requisite of which is\r\nan enlarged faith in fellow-citizens. All republicans are patriotic,\r\nmore or less frequently and loftily. If every American will look into\r\nhimself at the moment he is glowing with patriotism, he will find his\r\nsectional prejudices melted away and gone, for the season. The Americans\r\nfeel this in their travels abroad, when their country is attacked. They\r\nyearn towards the remotest dwellers in their country as if they were the\r\nnearest and dearest. Would they could always feel thus at home, and in\r\nthe absence of provocation!\r\n\r\nThe most mortifying instance that I witnessed of this sectional\r\nprejudice was at Cincinnati. It was the most mortifying, on two\r\naccounts; because it did not give way before intercourse; and because\r\nits consequences are likely to be very serious to the city, and, if it\r\nspreads, to the whole west. One may laugh at the untravelled citizen of\r\nthe south who declares that he knows the New Englanders very well. \"How\r\nshould you know the New Englanders?\" \"O, they drive about in our parts\r\nsometimes:\"--\"they\" meaning the Yankee pedlars with wooden clocks for\r\nsale. One may laugh at the simple youth on board a steam-boat on Lake\r\nErie, who warned me not to believe anything the Huron people might tell\r\nme against the Sandusky people, because he could tell me beforehand that\r\nit was all false, and that the Sandusky people are far better than the\r\nHuron people. One may laugh at the contemptuous amazement of the Boston\r\nlady at my declaration that I liked Cincinnati; that wild western place,\r\nwhere she believed people did not sit down to dinner like Christians.\r\nAll mistakes of this kind, it is clear, might be rectified by a little\r\ntravelling. But it is a serious matter to see the travelled gentlemen,\r\nthe professional men of such a place as Cincinnati, setting up their\r\nsectional prejudices in one another's way.\r\n\r\nCincinnati is a glorious place. Few things can be conceived finer than\r\nthe situation of this magnificent city, and the beauty by which she is\r\nsurrounded. She is enthroned upon a high platform,--one of the rich\r\nbottoms occurring on the Ohio, which expand the traveller's notions of\r\nwhat fertility is. Behind her are hills, opening and closing, receding\r\nand advancing; here glowing with the richest green pasturage, and there\r\ncrested and ribbed by beeches which seem transplanted from some giant\r\nland. Wherever we went among these hills, we found them rounding away\r\nfrom us in some new form of beauty; in steep grassy slopes, with a\r\nrunning stream at the bottom; in shadowy precipices, bristling with\r\ntrees; in quiet recesses, pierced by sunset lights, shining in among the\r\nbeechen stems, which spring, unencumbered by undergrowth, from the rich\r\nelastic turf. These hill-sides reminded me of the Castle of Indolence,\r\nof the quiet paths of Eden, of the shades that Una trod, of Windsor\r\nForest,--of all that my memory carried about undulating wood-lands: but\r\nnothing would do; no description that I am acquainted with is rich\r\nenough to answer to what I saw on the Ohio,--its slopes, and clumps, and\r\ngroves. At the foot of these hills runs the river, broad and full, busy\r\nwith the commerce of the wide West. A dozen steam-boats lie abreast at\r\nthe wharf, and many more are constantly passing; some stealing along,\r\nunheard so far off, under the opposite bank; others puffing and\r\nploughing along the middle of the stream. Fine, level turnpike-roads\r\nbranch off from the city among the hills, which open so as to allow a\r\nfree circulation of air over the entire platform. Cincinnati is the most\r\nhealthy large city in the United States. The streets are wide; and the\r\nterraces afford fine situations for houses. The furnishing of the\r\ndwellings is as magnificent as the owners may choose to make it; for\r\ncommerce with the whole world is carried on from their port. Their\r\nvineyards, their conservatories, their fruit and flower gardens delight\r\nthe eye in the gorgeous month of June. They have a native artist of\r\ngreat genius who has adorned the walls of their houses with, perhaps,\r\nthe best pictures I saw in the country. I saw their streets filled with\r\ntheir thousands of free-school children. \"These,\" said a lady to me,\r\n\"are our populace.\" I thought it a populace worthy of such a city. There\r\nis no need to speak of its long ranges of furnaces, of its shipping, of\r\nits incredible commerce in pork, of its wealth and prospects. Suffice it\r\nthat one of its most respected inhabitants tells that when he landed in\r\nOhio, less than fifty years ago, it contained fewer than a hundred\r\nwhites; and buffalo lodged in a cane brake where the city now stands;\r\nwhile the State at present contains upwards of a million of inhabitants,\r\nthe city between thirty and forty thousand; and Cincinnati has four\r\ndaily, and five or six weekly, newspapers, besides a variety of other\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance, and the most favourable, with regard\r\nto the peopling of Cincinnati is, that its population contains\r\ncontributions of almost every element that goes to constitute society;\r\nand each in its utmost vigour. There are here few of the arbitrary\r\nassociations which exist among the members of other societies. Young men\r\ncome with their wives, in all directions, from afar; with no parents,\r\ncousins, sects, or parties about them. Here is an assemblage from almost\r\nevery nation under heaven,--a contribution from the resources of almost\r\nevery country; and all unburdened, and ready for natural association and\r\nvigorous action. Like takes to like, and friendships are formed from\r\ncongeniality, and not from accident or worldly design. Yet is there a\r\ntempering of prejudices, a mutual enlightenment, from previous\r\ndifferences of education and habits,--difference even of country and\r\nlanguage. Great force is thus given to any principle carried out into\r\naction by the common convictions of differing persons; and life is deep\r\nand rapid in its course. Such is the theory of society in Cincinnati;\r\nand such is, in some degree, its practice. But here it is that sectional\r\nprejudice interferes, to set up arbitrary associations where, of all\r\nplaces, they should be shunned.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers who barbarize society in new places, have gone westward;\r\nand, of the full population that remains, above one-fifth are Germans.\r\nTheir function seems to be, everywhere in the United States, to\r\ndevelope the material resources of the infant places in which they\r\nsettle; and the intellectual ones at a more advanced stage. They are the\r\nfarmers and market-gardeners here. There are many English, especially\r\namong the artizans. I saw two handsome white houses, on the side of a\r\nhill above the river, with rich ground lots, and extensive garden walls.\r\nThese are the property of two English artizans, brothers, who emigrated\r\na very few years ago. An Englishman, servant to a physician in\r\nCincinnati in 1818, turned pork-butcher; was worth 10,000 dollars when I\r\nwas there, and is rapidly growing rich. There are many New Englanders\r\namong the clergy, lawyers, and merchants; and this is the portion of\r\nsociety that will not freely mix with the westerners. It is no wonder if\r\nthe earliest settlers of the place, westerners, are proud of it, and are\r\ncareful to cherish its primitive emblems and customs. The New Englanders\r\nshould not take this as an affront to themselves. It is also natural\r\nenough that the New Englanders should think and speak alike, and be fond\r\nof acting together; and the westerners should not complain of their\r\nbeing clannish. I was at a delightful party at the house of one of the\r\noldest inhabitants, where a sprig of the distinctive buck-eye was hung\r\nup in the hall, and a buck-eye bowl of lemonade stood on the table. This\r\nwas peevishly commented upon by some of eastern derivation: but I\r\nthought it would have been wiser to adopt the emblem than to find fault\r\nwith it. Cincinnati has not gone to the eastern people: the eastern\r\npeople have gone to her. If they have adopted her for their city, they\r\nmay as well adopt her emblems too, and make themselves westerners at\r\nheart, as well as in presence. These discontents may appear trifling;\r\nbut they are not so while they impede the furtherance of great objects.\r\nI was told on the spot that they would be very transient; but I fear it\r\nis not so. And yet they would be very transient if the spirited and\r\nchoice inhabitants of that magnificent city could see their position as\r\nit is viewed by people at a distance. When I was one day expressing my\r\nadmiration, and saying that it was a place for people of ambition,\r\nworldly or philanthropic, to live in, one of its noblest citizens said,\r\n\"Yes, we have a new creation going on here; won't you come and dabble in\r\nthe mud?\" If they will but remember that it is a new creation that is\r\ngoing on, and not a fortuitous concourse of atoms; that the human will\r\nis, or may be, the presiding intelligence; that centuries hence, their\r\nposterity will either bless their memories with homage like that which\r\nis paid to the Pilgrim Fathers, or suffer the retribution which follows\r\nthe indulgence of human passions, all petty jealousies will surely\r\nsubside, in the prospect which lies before every good man. In a place\r\nlike Cincinnati, where every man may gratify his virtuous will, and do,\r\nwith his own hands, the deeds of a generation, feelings should be as\r\ngrand as the occasion. If the merchants of Genoa were princes, the\r\ncitizens of Cincinnati, as of every first city of a new region, are\r\nprinces and prophets at once. They can foresee the future, if they\r\nplease; and shape it, if they will: and petty personal regards are\r\nunworthy of such a destiny. It is melancholy to see how the crusading\r\nchiefs quarrelled for precedence on the soil of the Holy Land: it would\r\nbe more so to see the leaders of this new enterprise desecrating their\r\nhigher mission by a like contention.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP OF PEOPLE OF COLOUR.\r\n\r\nBefore I entered New England, while I was ascending the Mississippi, I\r\nwas told by a Boston gentleman that the people of colour in the New\r\nEngland States were perfectly well-treated; that the children were\r\neducated in schools provided for them; and that their fathers freely\r\nexercised the franchise. This gentleman certainly believed he was\r\ntelling me the truth. That he, a busy citizen of Boston, should know no\r\nbetter, is now as striking an exemplification of the state of the case\r\nto me as a correct representation of the facts would have been. There\r\nare two causes for his mistake. He was not aware that the schools for\r\nthe coloured children in New England are, unless they escape by their\r\ninsignificance, shut up, or pulled down, or the school-house wheeled\r\naway upon rollers over the frontier of a pious State, which will not\r\nendure that its coloured citizens should be educated. He was not aware\r\nof a gentleman of colour, and his family, being locked out of their own\r\nhired pew in a church, because their white brethren will not Worship by\r\ntheir side. But I will not proceed with an enumeration of injuries, too\r\nfamiliar to Americans to excite any feeling but that of weariness; and\r\ntoo disgusting to all others to be endured. The other cause of this\r\ngentleman's mistake was, that he did not, from long custom, feel some\r\nthings to be injuries, which he would call anything but good treatment,\r\nif he had to bear them himself. Would he think it good treatment to be\r\nforbidden to eat with fellow-citizens; to be assigned to a particular\r\ngallery in his church; to be excluded from college, from municipal\r\noffice, from professions, from scientific and literary associations? If\r\nhe felt himself excluded from every department of society, but its\r\nhumiliations and its drudgery, would he declare himself to be \"perfectly\r\nwell-treated in Boston?\" Not a word more of statement is needed.\r\n\r\nA Connecticut judge lately declared on the bench that he believed people\r\nof colour were not considered citizens in the laws. He was proved to be\r\nwrong. He was actually ignorant of the wording of the acts by which\r\npeople of colour are termed citizens. Of course, no judge could have\r\nforgotten this who had seen them treated as citizens: nor could one of\r\nthe most eminent statesmen and lawyers in the country have told me that\r\nit is still a doubt, in the minds of some high authorities, whether\r\npeople of colour are citizens. He is as mistaken as the judge. There has\r\nbeen no such doubt since the Connecticut judge was corrected and\r\nenlightened. The error of the statesman arose from the same cause; he\r\nhad never seen the coloured people treated as citizens. \"In fact,\" said\r\nhe, \"these people hold an anomalous situation. They are protected as\r\ncitizens when the public service requires their security; but not\r\notherwise treated as such,\" Any comment would weaken this intrepid\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThe common argument, about the inferiority of the coloured race, bears\r\nno relation whatever to this question. They are citizens. They stand, as\r\nsuch, in the law, and in the acknowledgment of every one who knows the\r\nlaw. They are citizens, yet their houses and schools are pulled down,\r\nand they can obtain no remedy at law. They are thrust out of offices,\r\nand excluded from the most honourable employments, and stripped of all\r\nthe best benefits of society by fellow-citizens who, once a year,\r\nsolemnly lay their hands on their hearts, and declare that all men are\r\nborn free and equal, and that rulers derive their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed.\r\n\r\nThis system of injury is not wearing out. Lafayette, on his last visit\r\nto the United States, expressed his astonishment at the increase of the\r\nprejudice against colour. He remembered, he said, how the black soldiers\r\nused to mess with the whites in the revolutionary war. The leaders of\r\nthat war are gone where principles are all,--where prejudices are\r\nnothing. If their ghosts could arise, in majestic array, before the\r\nAmerican nation, on their great anniversary, and hold up before them the\r\nmirror of their constitution, in the light of its first principles,\r\nwhere would the people hide themselves from the blasting radiance? They\r\nwould call upon their holy soil to swallow them up, as unworthy to tread\r\nupon it. But not all. It should ever be remembered that America is the\r\ncountry of the best friends the coloured race has ever had. The more\r\ntruth there is in the assertions of the oppressors of the blacks, the\r\nmore heroism there is in their friends. The greater the excuse for the\r\npharisees of the community, the more divine is the equity of the\r\nredeemers of the coloured race. If it be granted that the coloured race\r\nare naturally inferior, naturally depraved, disgusting, cursed,--it must\r\nbe granted that it is a heavenly charity which descends among them to\r\ngive such solace as it can to their incomprehensible existence. As long\r\nas the excuses of the one party go to enhance the merit of the other,\r\nthe society is not to be despaired of, even with this poisonous anomaly\r\nat its heart.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, the coloured race is not cursed by God, as it is by\r\nsome factions of his children. The less clear-sighted of them are\r\npardonable for so believing. Circumstances, for which no living man is\r\nanswerable, have generated an erroneous conviction in the feeble mind of\r\nman, which sees not beyond the actual and immediate. No remedy could\r\never have been applied, unless stronger minds than ordinary had been\r\nbrought into the case. But it so happens, wherever there is an anomaly,\r\ngiant minds rise up to overthrow it: minds gigantic, not in\r\nunderstanding, but in faith. Wherever they arise, they are the salt of\r\ntheir earth, and its corruption is retrieved. So it is now in America.\r\nWhile the mass of common men and women are despising, and disliking, and\r\nfearing, and keeping down the coloured race, blinking the fact that they\r\nare citizens, the few of Nature's aristocracy are putting forth a strong\r\nhand to lift up this degraded race out of oppression, and their country\r\nfrom the reproach of it. If they were but one or two, trembling and\r\ntoiling in solitary energy, the world afar would be confident of their\r\nsuccess. But they number hundreds and thousands; and if ever they feel a\r\npassing doubt of their progress, it is only because they are pressed\r\nupon by the meaner multitude. Over the sea, no one doubts of their\r\nvictory. It is as certain as that the risen sun will reach the meridian.\r\nAlready are there overflowing colleges, where no distinction of colour\r\nis allowed;--overflowing, _because_ no distinction of colour is allowed.\r\nAlready have people of colour crossed the thresholds of many whites, as\r\nguests, not as drudges or beggars. Already are they admitted to worship,\r\nand to exercise charity, among the whites.\r\n\r\nThe world has heard and seen enough of the reproach incurred by America,\r\non account of her coloured population. It is now time to look for the\r\nfairer side The crescent streak is brightening towards the full, to wane\r\nno more. Already is the world beyond the sea beginning to think of\r\nAmerica, less as the country of the double-faced pretender to the name\r\nof Liberty, than as the home of the single-hearted, clear-eyed Presence\r\nwhich, under the name of Abolitionism, is majestically passing through\r\nthe land which is soon to be her throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL NON-EXISTENCE OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental principles announced in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence is, that governments derive their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed. How can the political condition of women be\r\nreconciled with this?\r\n\r\nGovernments in the United States have power to tax women who hold\r\nproperty; to divorce them from their husbands; to fine, imprison, and\r\nexecute them for certain offences. Whence do these governments derive\r\ntheir powers? They are not \"just,\" as they are not derived from the\r\nconsent of the women thus governed.\r\n\r\nGovernments in the United States have power to enslave certain women;\r\nand also to punish other women for inhuman treatment of such slaves.\r\nNeither of these powers are \"just;\" not being derived from the consent\r\nof the governed.\r\n\r\nGovernments decree to women in some States half their husbands'\r\nproperty; in others one-third. In some, a woman, on her marriage, is\r\nmade to yield all her property to her husband; in others, to retain a\r\nportion, or the whole, in her own hands. Whence do governments derive\r\nthe unjust power of thus disposing of property without the consent of\r\nthe governed?\r\n\r\nThe democratic principle condemns all this as wrong; and requires the\r\nequal political representation of all rational beings. Children, idiots,\r\nand criminals, during the season of sequestration, are the only fair\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nThe case is so plain that I might close it here; but it is interesting\r\nto inquire how so obvious a decision has been so evaded as to leave to\r\nwomen no political rights whatever. The question has been asked, from\r\ntime to time, in more countries than one, how obedience to the laws can\r\nbe required of women, when no woman has, either actually or virtually,\r\ngiven any assent to any law. No plausible answer has, as far as I can\r\ndiscover, been offered; for the good reason, that no plausible answer\r\ncan be devised. The most principled democratic writers on government\r\nhave on this subject sunk into fallacies, as disgraceful as any advocate\r\nof despotism has adduced. In fact, they have thus sunk from being, for\r\nthe moment, advocates of despotism. Jefferson in America, and James Mill\r\nat home, subside, for the occasion, to the level of the author of the\r\nEmperor of Russia's Catechism for the young Poles.\r\n\r\nJefferson says,[7] \"Were our State a pure democracy, in which all the\r\ninhabitants should meet together to transact all their business, there\r\nwould yet be excluded from their deliberations,\r\n\r\n\"1. Infants, until arrived at years of discretion;\r\n\r\n\"2. Women, who, to prevent depravation of morals, and ambiguity of\r\nissue, could not mix promiscuously in the public meetings of men;\r\n\r\n\"3. Slaves, from whom the unfortunate state of things with us takes away\r\nthe rights of will and of property.\"\r\n\r\nIf the slave disqualification, here assigned, were shifted up under the\r\nhead of Women, their case would be nearer the truth than as it now\r\nstands. Woman's lack of will and of property, is more like the true\r\ncause of her exclusion from the representation, than that which is\r\nactually set down against her. As if there could be no means of\r\nconducting public affairs but by promiscuous meetings! As if there would\r\nbe more danger in promiscuous meetings for political business than in\r\nsuch meetings for worship, for oratory, for music, for dramatic\r\nentertainments,--for any of the thousand transactions of civilized life!\r\nThe plea is not worth another word.\r\n\r\nMill says, with regard to representation, in his Essay on Government,\r\n\"One thing is pretty clear; that all those individuals, whose interests\r\nare involved in those of other individuals, may be struck off without\r\ninconvenience.... In this light, women may be regarded, the interest of\r\nalmost all of whom is involved, either in that of their fathers or in\r\nthat of their husbands.\"\r\n\r\nThe true democratic principle is, that no person's interests can be, or\r\ncan be ascertained to be, identical with those of any other person. This\r\nallows the exclusion of none but incapables.\r\n\r\nThe word \"almost,\" in Mr. Mill's second sentence, rescues women from the\r\nexclusion he proposes. As long as there are women who have neither\r\nhusbands nor fathers, his proposition remains an absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe interests of women who have fathers and husbands can never be\r\nidentical with theirs, while there is a necessity for laws to protect\r\nwomen against their husbands and fathers. This statement is not worth\r\nanother word.\r\n\r\nSome who desire that there should be an equality of property between men\r\nand women, oppose representation, on the ground that political duties\r\nwould be incompatible with the other duties which women have to\r\ndischarge. The reply to this is, that women are the best judges here.\r\nGod has given time and power for the discharge of all duties; and, if he\r\nhad not, it would be for women to decide which they would take, and\r\nwhich they would leave. But their guardians follow the ancient fashion\r\nof deciding what is best for their wards. The Emperor of Russia\r\ndiscovers when a coat of arms and title do not agree with a subject\r\nprince. The King of France early perceives that the air of Paris does\r\nnot agree with a free-thinking foreigner. The English Tories feel the\r\nhardship that it would be to impose the franchise on every artizan, busy\r\nas he is in getting his bread. The Georgian planter perceives the\r\nhardship that freedom would be to his slaves. And the best friends of\r\nhalf the human race peremptorily decide for them as to their rights,\r\ntheir duties, their feelings, their powers. In all these cases, the\r\npersons thus cared for feel that the abstract decision rests with\r\nthemselves; that, though they may be compelled to submit, they need not\r\nacquiesce.\r\n\r\nIt is pleaded that half of the human race does acquiesce in the decision\r\nof the other half, as to their rights and duties. And some instances,\r\nnot only of submission, but of acquiescence, there are. Forty years ago,\r\nthe women of New Jersey went to the poll, and voted, at state elections.\r\nThe general term, \"inhabitants,\" stood unqualified;--as it will again,\r\nwhen the true democratic principle comes to be fully understood. A\r\nmotion was made to correct the inadvertence; and it was done, as a\r\nmatter of course; without any appeal, as far as I could learn, from the\r\npersons about to be injured. Such acquiescence proves nothing but the\r\ndegradation of the injured party. It inspires the same emotions of pity\r\nas the supplication of the freed slave who kneels to his master to\r\nrestore him to slavery, that he may have his animal wants supplied,\r\nwithout being troubled with human rights and duties. Acquiescence like\r\nthis is an argument which cuts the wrong way for those who use it.\r\n\r\nBut this acquiescence is only partial; and, to give any semblance of\r\nstrength to the plea, the acquiescence must be complete. I, for one, do\r\nnot acquiesce. I declare that whatever obedience I yield to the laws of\r\nthe society in which I live is a matter between, not the community and\r\nmyself, but my judgment and my will. Any punishment inflicted on me for\r\nthe breach of the laws, I should regard as so much gratuitous injury:\r\nfor to those laws I have never, actually or virtually, assented. I know\r\nthat there are women in England who agree with me in this--I know that\r\nthere are women in America who agree with me in this. The plea of\r\nacquiescence is invalidated by us.\r\n\r\nIt is pleaded that, by enjoying the protection of some laws, women give\r\ntheir assent to all. This needs but a brief answer. Any protection thus\r\nconferred is, under woman's circumstances, a boon bestowed at the\r\npleasure of those in whose power she is. A boon of any sort is no\r\ncompensation for the privation of something else; nor can the enjoyment\r\nof it bind to the performance of anything to which it bears no relation.\r\nBecause I, by favour, may procure the imprisonment of the thief who robs\r\nmy house, am I, unrepresented, therefore bound not to smuggle French\r\nribbons? The obligation not to smuggle has a widely different\r\nderivation.\r\n\r\nI cannot enter upon the commonest order of pleas of all;--those which\r\nrelate to the virtual influence of woman; her swaying the judgment and\r\nwill of man through the heart; and so forth. One might as well try to\r\ndissect the morning mist. I knew a gentleman in America who told me how\r\nmuch rather he had be a woman than the man he is;--a professional man, a\r\nfather, a citizen. He would give up all this for a woman's influence. I\r\nthought he was mated too soon. He should have married a lady, also of my\r\nacquaintance, who would not at all object to being a slave, if ever the\r\nblacks should have the upper hand; \"it is so right that the one race\r\nshould be subservient to the other!\" Or rather,--I thought it a pity\r\nthat the one could not be a woman, and the other a slave; so that an\r\ninjured individual of each class might be exalted into their places, to\r\nfulfil and enjoy the duties and privileges which they despise, and, in\r\ndespising, disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that while there is much said about \"the sphere of woman,\"\r\ntwo widely different notions are entertained of what is meant by the\r\nphrase. The narrow, and, to the ruling party, the more convenient notion\r\nis that sphere appointed by men, and bounded by their ideas of\r\npropriety;--a notion from which any and every woman may fairly dissent.\r\nThe broad and true conception is of the sphere appointed by God, and\r\nbounded by the powers which he has bestowed. This commands the assent of\r\nman and woman; and only the question of powers remains to be proved.\r\n\r\nThat woman has power to represent her own interests, no one can deny\r\ntill she has been tried. The modes need not be discussed here: they must\r\nvary with circumstances. The fearful and absurd images which are\r\nperpetually called up to perplex the question,--images of women on\r\nwool-sacks in England, and under canopies in America, have nothing to do\r\nwith the matter. The principle being once established, the methods will\r\nfollow, easily, naturally, and under a remarkable transmutation of the\r\nludicrous into the sublime. The kings of Europe would have laughed\r\nmightily, two centuries ago, at the idea of a commoner, without robes,\r\ncrown, or sceptre, stepping into the throne of a strong nation. Yet who\r\ndared to laugh when Washington's super-royal voice greeted the New World\r\nfrom the presidential chair, and the old world stood still to catch the\r\necho?\r\n\r\nThe principle of the equal rights of both halves of the human race is\r\nall we have to do with here. It is the true democratic principle which\r\ncan never be seriously controverted, and only for a short time evaded.\r\nGovernments can derive their just powers only from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] Correspondence vol. iv. p. 295.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nECONOMY.\r\n\r\n     \"That thou givest them they gather. Thou openest thine hand; they\r\n     are filled with good.\"\r\n\r\n     _104th Psalm._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller from the Old World to the New is apt to lose himself in\r\nreflection when he should be observing. Speculations come in crowds in\r\nthe wilderness. He finds himself philosophizing with every step he\r\ntakes, as luxuriously as by his study fireside, or in his rare solitary\r\nwalk at home.\r\n\r\nIn England, everything comes complete and finished under notice. Each\r\nman may be aware of some one process of formation, which it is his\r\nbusiness to conduct; but all else is presented to him in its entireness.\r\nThe statesman knows what it is to compose an act of parliament; to\r\nproceed from the first perception of the want of it, through the\r\ngathering together of facts and opinions, the selection from these, the\r\nelaborating, adjusting, moulding, specifying, excluding, consolidating,\r\ntill it becomes an entire something, which he throws down for parliament\r\nto find fault with. When it is passed, the rest of society looks upon it\r\nas a whole, as a child does upon a table or a doll, without being aware\r\nof any process of formation. The shoemaker, thus, takes his loaf of\r\nbread, and the clock that ticks behind his door, as if they came down\r\nfrom the clouds as they are, in return for so much of his wages; and he\r\nanalyzes nothing but shoes. The baker and watchmaker receive their shoes\r\nin the same way, and analyze nothing but bread and clocks. Too many\r\ngentlemen and ladies analyze nothing at all. If better taught, and\r\nintroduced at an early age into the world of analysis, nothing, in the\r\nwhole course of education, is probably so striking to their minds. They\r\nbegin a fresh existence from the day when they first obtain a glimpse\r\ninto this new region of discovery.\r\n\r\nSuch an era is the traveller's entrance upon the wilder regions of\r\nAmerica. His old experience is all reversed. He sees nothing of art in\r\nits entireness; but little of nature in her instrumentality. Nature is\r\nthere the empress, not the handmaid. Art is her inexperienced page, and\r\nno longer the Prospero to whom she is the Ariel.\r\n\r\nIt is an absorbing thing to watch the process of world-making:--both the\r\nformation of the natural and the conventional world. I witnessed both in\r\nAmerica; and when I look back upon it now, it seems as if I had been in\r\nanother planet. I saw something of the process of creating the natural\r\nglobe in the depths of the largest explored cave in the world. In its\r\ndepths, in this noiseless workshop, was Nature employed with her blind\r\nand dumb agents, fashioning mysteries which the earthquake of a thousand\r\nyears hence may bring to light, to give man a new sense of the shortness\r\nof his life. I saw something of the process of world-making behind the\r\nfall of Niagara, in the thunder cavern, where the rocks that have stood\r\nfor ever tremble to their fall amidst the roar of the unexhausted\r\nfloods. I stood where soon human foot shall stand no more. Foot-hold\r\nafter foot-hold is destined to be thrown down, till, after more ages\r\nthan the world has yet known, the last rocky barrier shall be\r\noverpowered, and an ocean shall overspread countries which are but just\r\nentering upon civilized existence. Niagara itself is but one of the\r\nshifting scenes of life, like all of the outward that we hold most\r\npermanent. Niagara itself, like the systems of the sky, is one of the\r\nhands of Nature's clock, moving, though too slowly to be perceived by\r\nthe unheeding,--still moving, to mark the lapse of time. Niagara itself\r\nis destined to be as the traditionary monsters of the ancient earth--a\r\ngiant existence, to be spoken of to wondering ears in studious hours,\r\nand believed in from the sole evidence of its surviving grandeur and\r\nbeauty. While I stood in the wet whirlwind, with the crystal roof above\r\nme, the thundering floor beneath, and the foaming whirlpool and rushing\r\nflood before me, I saw those quiet, studious hours of the future world\r\nwhen this cataract shall have become a tradition, and the spot on which\r\nI stood shall be the centre of a wide sea, a new region of life. This\r\nwas seeing world-making. So it was on the Mississippi, when a sort of\r\nscum on the waters betokened the birth-place of new land. All things\r\nhelp in this creation. The cliffs of the upper Missouri detach their\r\nsoil, and send it thousands of miles down the stream. The river brings\r\nit, and deposits it, in continual increase, till a barrier is raised\r\nagainst the rushing waters themselves. The air brings seeds, and drops\r\nthem where they sprout, and strike downwards, so that their roots bind\r\nthe soft soil, and enable it to bear the weight of new accretions. The\r\ninfant forest, floating, as it appeared, on the surface of the turbid\r\nand rapid waters, may reveal no beauty to the painter; but to the eye\r\nof one who loves to watch the process of world-making, it is full of\r\ndelight. These islands are seen in every stage of growth. The\r\ncotton-wood trees, from being like cresses in a pool, rise breast-high;\r\nthen they are like the thickets, to whose shade the alligator may\r\nretreat; then, like groves that bid the sun good-night, while he is\r\nstill lighting up the forest; then like the forest itself, with the\r\nwood-cutter's house within its screen, flowers springing about its\r\nstems, and the wild-vine climbing to meet the night breezes on its lofty\r\ncanopy. This was seeing world-making. Here was strong instigation to the\r\nexercise of analysis.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent thoughts of a speculator in these wildernesses,\r\nis the rarity of the chance which brings him here to speculate. The\r\nprimitive glories of nature have, almost always since the world began,\r\nbeen dispensed to savages; to men who, dearly as they love the\r\nwilderness, have no power of bringing into contrast with it the mind of\r\nman, as enriched and stimulated by cultivated society. Busy colonists,\r\npressed by bodily wants, are the next class brought over the threshold\r\nof this temple: and they come for other purposes than to meditate. The\r\nnext are those who would make haste to be rich; selfish adventurers, who\r\ndrive out the red man, and drive in the black man, and, amidst the\r\nforests and the floods, think only of cotton and of gold. Not to such\r\nalone should the primitive glories of nature be dispensed; glories which\r\ncan never be restored. The philosopher should come, before they are\r\neffaced, and find combinations and proportions of life and truth which\r\nare not to be found elsewhere. The painter should come, and find\r\ncombinations and proportions of visible beauty which are not to be found\r\nelsewhere. The architect should come, and find suggestions and\r\nirradiations of his art which are not to be found elsewhere. The poet\r\nshould come, and witness a supremacy of nature such as he imagines in\r\nthe old days when the world's sires came forth at the tidings of the\r\nrainbow in the cloud. The chance which opens to the meditative the\r\nalmost untouched regions of nature, is a rare one; and they should not\r\nbe left to the vanishing savage, the busy and the sordid.\r\n\r\nI watched also the progress of conventional life. I saw it in every\r\nstage of advancement, from the clearing in the woods, where the settler,\r\ncarrying merely his axe, makes his very tools, his house, his fireplace,\r\nhis bed, his table; carves out his fields, catches from among wild or\r\nstrayed animals his farm stock, and creates his own food, warmth, and\r\nwinter light,--from primitive life like this, to that of the highest\r\nfinish, which excludes all thought of analysis.\r\n\r\nThe position or prospects of men in a new country may best be made\r\nintelligible by accounts of what the traveller saw and heard while among\r\nthem. Pictures serve the purpose better than reports. I will, therefore,\r\ngive pictures of some of the many varieties of dwellers that I saw,\r\namidst their different localities, circumstances, and modes of living.\r\nNo one of them is aware how vivid an idea he impresses on the mind of\r\nhumanity; nor how distinct a place he fills in her records. No one of\r\nthem, probably, is aware how much happier he is than Alexander, in\r\nhaving before him more worlds to conquer.\r\n\r\nMy narratives, or pictures, must be but a few selected from among a\r\nmultitude. My chapter would extend to a greater length than any old\r\nnovel, if I were to give all I possess.\r\n\r\nThe United States are not only vast in extent: they are inestimably rich\r\nin material wealth. There are fisheries and granite quarries along the\r\nnorthern coasts; and shipping from the whole commercial world within\r\ntheir ports. There are tanneries within reach of their oak woods, and\r\nmanufactures in the north from the cotton growth of the south. There is\r\nunlimited wealth of corn, sugar-cane and beet, hemp, flax, tobacco, and\r\nrice. There are regions of pasture land. There are varieties of grape\r\nfor wine, and mulberries for silk. There is salt. There are mineral\r\nsprings. There is marble, gold, lead, iron, and coal. There is a chain\r\nof mountains, dividing the great fertile western valley from the busy\r\neastern region which lies between the mountains and the Atlantic. These\r\nmountains yield the springs by which the great rivers are to be fed for\r\never, to fertilize the great valley, and be the vehicle of its commerce\r\nwith the world. Out of the reach of these rivers, in the vast breadth of\r\nthe north, lie the great lakes, to be likewise the servants of commerce,\r\nand to afford in their fisheries the means of life and luxury to\r\nthousands. These inland seas temper the climate, summer and winter, and\r\ninsure health to the heart of the vast continent. Never was a country\r\nmore gifted by nature.\r\n\r\nIt is blessed also in the variety of its inhabitants. However it may\r\ngratify the pride of a nation to be descended from one stock, it is\r\nultimately better that it should have been compounded from many nations.\r\nThe blending of qualities, physical and intellectual, the absorption of\r\nnational prejudices, the increase of mental resources, will be found in\r\nthe end highly conducive to the elevation of the national character.\r\nAmerica will find herself largely blessed in this way, however much she\r\nmay now complain of the immigration of strangers. She complains of some\r\nfor their poverty; but such bring a will to work, and a capacity for\r\nlabour. She complains of others for their coming from countries\r\ngoverned by a despotism; but it is the love of freedom which they cannot\r\nenjoy at home, that brings such. She complains of others that they keep\r\nup their national language, manners, and modes of thinking, while they\r\nuse her privileges of citizenship. This may appear ungracious; but it\r\nproceeds from that love of country and home institutions which will make\r\nstaunch American patriots of their children's children. It is all well.\r\nThe New England States may pride themselves on their population being\r\nhomogeneous, while that of other States is mongrel. It is well that\r\nstability should thus have been temporarily provided for in one part of\r\nthe Union, which should, for the season, be the acknowledged superior\r\nover the rest: but, this purpose of the arrangement having been\r\nfulfilled, New England may perhaps hereafter admit, what some others see\r\nalready, that, if she inherits many of the virtues of the Pilgrims, she\r\nrequires fortifying in others; and that a large reinforcement from other\r\nraces would help her to throw off the burden of their inherited faults.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be a finer set of elements for the composition of a\r\nnation than the United States now contain. It will take centuries to\r\nfuse them; and by that time, pride of ancestry,--vanity of physical\r\nderivation,--will be at an end. The ancestry of moral qualities will be\r\nthe only pedigree preserved: and of these every civilized nation under\r\nheaven possesses an ample, and probably an equal, share. Let the United\r\nStates then cherish their industrious Germans and Dutch; their hardy\r\nIrish; their intelligent Scotch; their kindly Africans, as well as the\r\nintellectual Yankee, the insouciant Southerner, and the complacent\r\nWesterner. All are good in their way; and augment the moral value of\r\ntheir country, as diversities of soil, climate, and productions, do its\r\nmaterial wealth.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting personages in the United States, are the\r\nSolitaries;--solitary families, not individuals. Europeans, who think it\r\nmuch to lodge in a country cottage for six weeks in the summer, can form\r\nlittle idea of the life of a solitary family in the wilds. I did not see\r\nthe most sequestered, as I never happened to lose my way in the forests\r\nor on the prairies: but I witnessed some modes of life which realized\r\nall I had conceived of the romantic, or of the dismal.\r\n\r\nOne rainy October day, I saw a settler at work in the forest, on which\r\nhe appeared to have just entered. His clearing looked, in comparison\r\nwith the forest behind him, of about the size of a pincushion. He was\r\nstanding, up to the knees in water, among the stubborn stumps, and\r\ncharred stems of dead trees. He was notching logs with his axe, beside\r\nhis small log hut and stye. There was swamp behind, and swamp on each\r\nside;--a pool of mud around each dead tree, which had been wont to drink\r\nthe moisture. There was a semblance of a tumble-down fence: no orchard\r\nyet; no grave-yard; no poultry; none of the graces of fixed habitation\r\nhad grown up. On looking back to catch a last view of the scene, I saw\r\ntwo little boys, about three and four years old, leading a horse home\r\nfrom the forest; one driving the animal behind with an armful of bush,\r\nand the other reaching up on tiptoe to keep his hold of the halter; and\r\nboth looking as if they would be drowned in the swamp. If the mother was\r\nwatching from the hut, she must have thought this strange dismal play\r\nfor her little ones. The hard-working father must be toiling for his\r\nchildren; for the success of his after life can hardly atone to him for\r\nsuch a destitution of comfort as I saw him in the midst of. Many such\r\nscenes are passed on every road in the western parts of the States. They\r\nbecome cheering when the plough is seen, or a few sheep are straggling\r\non the hill side, seeming lost in space.\r\n\r\nOne day, at Niagara, I had spent hours at the Falls, till, longing for\r\nthe stillness of the forest, I wandered deep into its wild paths,\r\nmeeting nothing but the belled heifer, grazing, and the slim, clean\r\nswine which live on the mast and roots they can find for themselves. I\r\nsaw some motion in a thicket, a little way from the path, and went to\r\nsee what it was. I found a little boy and girl, working away, by turns,\r\nwith an axe, at the branches of a huge hickory, which had been lately\r\nfelled. \"Father\" had felled the hickory the day before, and had sent the\r\nchildren to make faggots from the branches. They were heated and out of\r\nbreath. I had heard of the toughness of hickory, and longed to know what\r\nthe labour of wood-cutting really was. Here was an irresistible\r\nopportunity for an experiment I made the children sit down on the fallen\r\ntree, and find out the use of my ear-trumpet, while I helped to make\r\ntheir faggot. When I had hewn through one stout branch, I was quite\r\nsufficiently warmed, and glad to sit down to hear the children's story.\r\nTheir father had been a weaver and a preacher in England. He had brought\r\nout his wife and six children. During the week, he worked at his land,\r\nfinding some employment or another for all of his children who could\r\nwalk alone; and going some distance on Sundays to preach. This last\r\nparticular told volumes. The weaver has not lost heart over his hard\r\nfield-labour. His spirit must be strong and lively, to enable him to\r\nspend his seventh day thus, after plying the axe for six. The children\r\ndid not seem to know whether they liked Manchester or the forest best;\r\nbut they looked stout and rosy.\r\n\r\nThey, however, were within reach of church and habitation; buried, as\r\nthey appeared, in the depths of the woods. I saw, in New Hampshire, a\r\nfamily who had always lived absolutely alone, except when an occasional\r\ntraveller came to their door, during the summer months. The old man had\r\nrun away with his wife, forty-six years before, and brought her to the\r\nRed Mountain, near the top of which she had lived ever since. It was\r\nwell that she married for love, for she saw no one but her husband and\r\nchildren, for many a long year after she jumped out of her window, in\r\nher father's house, to run away.\r\n\r\nOur party, consisting of four, was in the humour to be struck with the\r\nromance of the domestic history of the old man of the mountain, as the\r\nguide is called. We had crossed Lake Winnepisseogee, the day before, and\r\nwatched from our piazza, at Centre Harbour, the softening of the evening\r\nlight over the broad sheet of water, and the purple islands that rested\r\nupon it. After dark, fires blazed forth from the promontories, and\r\nglimmered in the islands; every flaming bush and burning stem being\r\ndistinctly reflected in the grey mirror of the waters. These fires were\r\nsigns of civilization approaching the wild districts on which we were\r\nentering. Land on the lake shores has become very valuable; and it is\r\nbeing fast cleared.\r\n\r\nWe were to have set off very early on our mountain expedition, next day;\r\nbut the morning was misty, and we did not leave Centre Harbour till near\r\neight;--nearly an hour and a half after breakfast. We were in a wagon,\r\ndrawn by the horses on which the two ladies were to ascend the mountain\r\nfrom the guide's house. The sky was grey, but promising; for its\r\ncurtains were rising at the other end of the lake, and disclosing ridge\r\nafter ridge of pines on the mountain side. The road became very rough as\r\nwe began to ascend; and it was a wonder to me how the wagon could be\r\nlifted up, as it was, from shelf to shelf of limestone. One shelf sloped\r\na little too much, even for our wagon. Its line of direction was no\r\nlonger within the base, as children are taught at school that it should\r\nbe. All the party, except myself, rolled out. The driver, sprawling on\r\nhis back on a terribly sharp eminence of limestone, tugged manfully at\r\nthe reins, and shouted, \"Whoi-ee\" as cheerfully as if he had been\r\nsitting on a cushion, in his proper place. He was not a man to desert\r\nhis duty in an extremity. He was but little hurt, and nobody else at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe wagon was left here, and we ascended a mile, a steep path, among\r\nwoods and rocks, to the guide's little farm; plunging into a cloud, just\r\nbefore we reached the house. It was baking day; and we found the old\r\ndame, with a deaf and dumb daughter,--one of three deaf,--busy among new\r\nbread, pies, and apples. Strings of apples hung against the walls; and\r\nthere was every symptom of plenty and contentment within and without\r\ndoors. The old dame might have been twin sister to Juliet's nurse. She\r\nwas delighted to have an opportunity of using her tongue, and was\r\nprofuse in her invitations to us to stay,--to come again,--to be\r\nsociable. The exercise she takes in speaking must be one cause of her\r\nbuxom health. Out of a pantomime, I never saw anything so energetic as\r\nher action; the deafness of her children being no doubt the cause of\r\nthis. She seemed heartily proud of them; the more, evidently, on account\r\nof their singularity. She told us that the daughter now at home had\r\nnever left it. \"Her father could not spare her to school; but I could\r\nhave spared her.\" What a life of little incidents magnified must their's\r\nbe! As one of my companions observed, the bursting of a shoe, or the\r\nbreaking of a plate, must furnish talk for a week. The welcome discovery\r\nwas made that we had a mutual acquaintance. A beloved friend of mine had\r\nascended the mountain some weeks before, and had followed her usual\r\npractice of carrying away all the hearts she found there. The old dame\r\nspoke lovingly of her as \"that Liza;\" and she talked about her till she\r\nhad seen my foot into the stirrup, and given me her blessing up the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThe path was steep, and the summit bare. There was an opening for a\r\nsingle moment on our arrival; the mist parted and closed again, having\r\nshown us what a view there was beneath us of green mountains, and blue\r\nponds, and wooded levels. We were entertained for some time with such\r\nglimpses; more beautiful perhaps than an unrestricted vision. Such\r\nrevelations take away one's breath. When all was misty again, we amused\r\nourselves with gathering blue-berries, which grew profusely under foot.\r\nThe old man, too, was ready with any information we desired about\r\nhimself; and with abundance of anecdotes of summer travellers, to whom\r\nhe had acted as guide.\r\n\r\nHe was a soldier of the revolution; and at its close, retired hither,\r\nwith his bride, among bears and deer. There are no deer left; and he\r\nkilled nineteen bears with his own hand: the last, thirty-five years\r\nbefore. One of them was nearly the death of him. A shot which he\r\nintended to be mortal was not so. The wounded bear chased him; and there\r\nwas nothing to be done but to run round and round a tree, loading his\r\ngun, while the bear was at his heels, blowing foam and blood upon him.\r\nHe fired over his shoulder, and dispatched his pursuer. He told us, when\r\nthe curtain of mist finally drew up, the opinions of learned men whom he\r\nhad conducted hither, about this mountain having once been an island in\r\nthe midst of a vast lake. He pointed out how it is, even now, nearly\r\nsurrounded by waters; Long Pond, Lake Winnepisseogee, and Squam Lake.\r\nThe two last are so crowded with islands that the expression of the\r\nwater is broken up. The islands lie in dark slips upon the gleamy\r\nsurface, dividing it into too many pond-like portions. But the mountain\r\nhorizon was altogether beautiful. Some had sharp peaks, some notched;\r\nthe sides of some were bare, with traces of tremendous slides: others,\r\ngreen as the spring, with wandering sun gleams and cloud shadows. I\r\nfound myself much mistaken in my fancy that I did not care for\r\nbird's-eye views.\r\n\r\nThe dame was looking out for us when we descended, anxious to detain us\r\nfor more talk, and to make us bearers of a present to \"that Liza.\" She\r\nhung some strings of her drying apples over the arm of a gentleman of\r\nthe party, with the utmost faith that he would take care of them all the\r\nway to Boston. He kindly received them; and I can testify that he did\r\nhis best to make them reach their destination. It was kindness well\r\nbestowed; for no doubt it was a winter luxury of the good dame's to\r\nfancy our mutual friend enjoying her Red Mountain applesauce. The\r\nsending a present to Boston must be a rare event to dwellers in such a\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nNot many miles from this place, stands a deserted dwelling whose\r\ninhabitants lived in a deeper solitude, and perished all in one night,\r\nfar from human aid. No house stands within many miles of it, even now. I\r\nhad heard the story before I saw the place; but I had no idea of the\r\ndifference between listening to a sad tale, and seeing the spot of which\r\nit is told. In a deep narrow valley among the White Mountains, lived a\r\nfamily of the name of Willey. Their dwelling was a comfortable\r\nlog-house, on a green platform, at the foot of one of the steepest\r\nmountains. There were but few travellers among these mountains in their\r\nday; but those few were kindly welcomed: and the cheerful host and\r\nhostess, and their comely children, were always well spoken of. On a\r\nstormy August night, 1826, a tremendous slide came crashing down the\r\nmountain side, at the rear of the house. If the family had remained in\r\ntheir chambers, they would have been safe: a rock at the edge of the\r\ngreen platform, behind the dwelling, parted the slide, so that the\r\ngrassy plot remained untouched,--a bright island in the midst, of the\r\ndesolation. The family, to the number of nine, were overwhelmed, and all\r\nperished. The bodies of seven were found. The bones of the other two are\r\ndoubtless buried under the slide, where rank verdure and young trees are\r\ngrowing up, as if trying to efface the horrors of the wreck. The scene\r\nmust have been dreadful to those who first arrived at the spot, after\r\nthe event. The house, safe on its grass plot; its door standing wide;\r\nthe beds and clothes of the family showing that they had sprung up from\r\nsleep, and so fled from the only place where they would have been safe;\r\nno one there; a deadly silence brooding over the quiet spot, and chaotic\r\ndesolation around;--it is no wonder that the house remains deserted, and\r\nthe valley untenanted.\r\n\r\nSome miles further on, the traveller may witness what comfortable cheer\r\nmay be afforded by dwellers in the wilderness. All travellers in the\r\nWhite Mountains know Ethan A. Crawford's hospitality. He cannot be said\r\nto live in solitude, inasmuch as there is another house in the valley:\r\nbut everybody is aware how little sociability there is between two\r\ndwellers in a lonely place. One may enjoy life there; and several may\r\nget on well; but two never: and Ethan Crawford's is a virtual solitude,\r\nexcept for three months in the year. The fate of the Willeys was\r\nuppermost in our minds when we arrived; and we were little prepared for\r\nsuch entertainment as we found. After a supper of fine lake trout, a son\r\nof our host played to us on a nameless instrument, made by the joiners\r\nwho put the house together, and highly creditable to their ingenuity. It\r\nwas something like the harmonica in form, and the bagpipes in tone; but,\r\nwell-played as it was by the boy, it was highly agreeable. Then Mr.\r\nCrawford danced an American jig, to the fiddling of a relation of his.\r\nThe dancing was somewhat solemn; but its good faith made up for any want\r\nof mirth. He had other resources for the amusement of his guests: a gun\r\nwherewith he was wont to startle the mountain echoes, till, one day, it\r\nburst: (leaving nothing for us to do but to look at the fragments:)\r\nalso, a horn, which, blown on a calm day, brings a chorus of sweet\r\nresponses from the far hill sides. Retirement in such a valley, and with\r\nsuch resources as Ethan Crawford's, is attractive enough to the passing\r\ntraveller; and, to judge by the countenance of the host, anything but\r\ndispiriting to those who have made trial of it.\r\n\r\nNo solitude can be more romantic than that at the mouth of the Mammoth\r\nCave in Kentucky; so called, not because any mammoth-bones have been\r\nfound there, but because it is the largest explored cave in the world. I\r\nwas told, not only by the guides, but by a gentleman who is learned in\r\ncaves, that it can be travelled through, in different directions, to the\r\nextent of sixty miles. We could not think of achieving the entire\r\nunderground journey; but we resolved to see all we could; and, for that\r\npurpose, preferred devoting the half of two days to the object, to one\r\nentire day, the weariness of which would probably curtail our rambles.\r\nAfter a most interesting and exciting journey of nearly two nights and\r\na day from Nashville, Tennessee, our party, consisting of four, arrived\r\nat Bell's hotel, twelve miles from the cave, at half-past seven, on a\r\nbright May morning. We slept till one o'clock, and then set off in a\r\nstage and four for the cave. My expectations had been so excited, that\r\nevery object on the road seemed to paint itself on my very spirit; and I\r\nnow feel as if I saw the bright hemp fields, the oak copses, the\r\ngorgeous wild flowers, and clear streams, running over their limestone\r\nbeds, that adorned our short journey.\r\n\r\nThe house at the cave stands on the greenest sward that earth and dews\r\ncan produce; and it grows up to the very walls of the dwelling. The\r\nwell, with its sweep,--a long pole, with a rope and bucket at one end,\r\nlaid across the top of a high post,--this primitive well, on the same\r\nplot of turf, and the carriage in which two travellers--young men--had\r\njust arrived, were the only occupiers of the grass, besides the house.\r\nWe lost no time in proceeding to the cave. The other party of travellers\r\nand the guides carried lamps, and grease to trim them with; an ample\r\nsupply of both; for the guides know something of the horrors of being\r\nleft in darkness in the mazes of a cave. We went down a steep path into\r\na glen, from which the golden sunlight seemed reflected, as from water;\r\nso bright was the May verdure. The guides carried our cloaks; which\r\nseemed to us very ridiculous; for we were panting with the heat. But,\r\nwhen we had wound down to the yawning, shadowy cave, with its diamond\r\ndrips and clustering creepers about the entrance, a blast of wintry wind\r\ngushed from it, and chilled our very hearts. I found it possible to\r\nstand on one foot, and be in the midst of melting heat; and leaning\r\nforward on the other, to feel half frozen. The humming birds must be\r\nastonished, when they flit across the entrance, to meet winter in the\r\nmiddle of the glen, and emerge into summer again on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the cave serves as an ice-house to the family of the\r\nguide. They keep their meat there, and go to refresh themselves when\r\nrelaxed by the heat. The temperature is delightful, after the first two\r\nor three minutes; and we were glad to leave our cloaks by the way side.\r\nThe ladies tied handkerchiefs over their heads, and tucked up their\r\ngowns for the scramble over the loose limestone; looking thereby very\r\npicturesque, and not totally unlike the witches in Macbeth. The gloom,\r\nthe echo of the footsteps, the hollow sound of voices, the startling\r\neffect of lights seen unexpectedly in a recess, in a crevice, or high\r\noverhead,--these impressions may be recalled in those who have wandered\r\nin caves, but can never be communicated to those who have not. It is in\r\nvain to describe a cave. Call it a chaos of darkness and rocks, with\r\nwandering and inexplicable sounds and motions, and all is done.\r\nEverything appears alive: the slowly growing stalactites, the water ever\r\ndropping into the plashing pool, the whispering airs,--all seem\r\nconscious. The coolness, vastness, suggestions of architecture, and dim\r\ndisclosures, occasion different feelings from any that are known under\r\nthe lights of the sky. The air in the neighbourhood of the waterfall was\r\ndelicious to breathe; and the pool was so clear that I could not, for\r\nsome time, see the water, in a pretty full light. That Rembrandt light\r\non the drip of water, on the piled rocks, and on our figures,--light\r\nswallowed up before it could reach the unseen canopy under which we\r\nstood, can never be forgotten. Milton's lake of fire might have brought\r\nthe roof into view:--nothing less.\r\n\r\nThe young guides, brothers, were fine dashing youths, as Kentucky youths\r\nare. They told us some horrible tales, and one very marvellous story\r\nabout darkness and bewilderment in the labyrinth of the cave. They told\r\nus (before they knew that any of us were English) that \"all the lords\r\nand lights of England had been to see the cave, except the king.\" While\r\nthey were about it, they might as well have included his majesty.\r\nPerhaps they have, by this time; good stories being of very rapid\r\ngrowth. They reported that ladies hold on in the cave better than\r\ngentlemen. One of the party supposed this was because they were lighter;\r\nbut the guide believed it was owing to their having more curiosity.\r\n\r\nI was amused at their assurances about the number of miles that we had\r\nwalked; and thought it as good a story as any they had told us: but, to\r\nmy utter amazement, I found, on emerging from the cave, that the stars\r\nwere shining resplendently down into the glen, while the summer\r\nlightning was quivering incessantly over the \"verdurous wall\" which\r\nsprang up to a lofty height on either hand. There seemed to be none of\r\nthe coolness of night abroad. A breathless faintness came over us on\r\nquitting the freshness of the cave, and taught us the necessary caution\r\nof resting awhile at the entrance.\r\n\r\nSupper was ready when we returned; and then the best room was assigned\r\nto the three ladies, while the gentlemen were to have the loft. We saw\r\nthe stars through chinks in our walls; but it was warm May, and we\r\nfeared no cold. Shallow tin-pans,--milk-pans, I believe,--were furnished\r\nto satisfy our request for ewer and basin. The windows had blinds of\r\npaper-hanging; a common sort of window-blind at hotels, and in country\r\nplaces. Before it was light, I was wakened by a strong cold breeze\r\nblowing upon me; and at dawn, I found that the entire lower half of the\r\nwindow was absent. A deer had leaped through it, a few weeks before; and\r\nthere had been no opportunity of mending it. But everything was clean;\r\neverybody was obliging; the hostess was motherly; and the conclusion\r\nthat we came to in the morning was that we had all slept well, and were\r\nready for a second ramble in the cave.\r\n\r\nWe saw, this day, the Grotto and the Deserted Chamber. Few visitors\r\nattempt the grotto, the entrance to it being in one part only a foot and\r\na half high. We were obliged, not only to go on hands and knees, but to\r\ncrawl lying flat. It is a sensation worth knowing, to feel oneself\r\nimprisoned in the very heart of a mountain, miles from the sun-light,\r\nand with no mode of escape but the imperceptible hole which a child\r\nmight block up in five minutes. Never was there a more magnificent\r\nprison or sepulchre. Whether the singularity of our mode of access\r\nmagnified to our eyes the beauties we had thereby come into the midst\r\nof, or whether Nature does work most _con amore_ in retired places, this\r\ngrotto seemed to us all by far the most beautiful part of the cave. The\r\ndry sandy floor was pleasant to the tread, after the loose limestone;\r\nthe pillars were majestic; the freaks of nature most wild and elegant.\r\nThe air was so fresh and cool that, if only a Rosicrucian lamp could be\r\nhung in this magnificent chamber, it would be the place of all others in\r\nwhich to spend the sultry summer's day,--entering when the beauties of\r\nthe sunrise had given place to glare, and issuing forth at the rising of\r\nthe evening star.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the Deserted Chamber, we cut off half a mile by a descent\r\nthrough a crevice, and a re-ascent by another. We were presently\r\nstartled by the apparition of two yellow stars, at what appeared an\r\nimmeasurable distance. In this cave, I was reminded, after a total\r\nforgetfulness of many years, of the night-mare visitations of my\r\nchildhood; especially of the sense of infinite distance, which used to\r\nterrify me indescribably. Here, too, the senses and the reason were\r\nbaulked. Those two yellow stars might have been worlds, many millions of\r\nmiles off in space, or,--what they were,--two shabby lamps, fifty yards\r\noff. A new visitor had arrived; and the old man of the solitary house\r\nhad brought him down, in hopes of meeting our larger party. One of the\r\ngentlemen presently slipped on the loose stones, and fell into a hole,\r\nwith his back against a sharp rock; and he seemed at first unable to\r\nrise. This was the only misadventure we had; and it did not prove a\r\nserious one. He was somewhat shaken and bruised, and rendered unwilling\r\nto go with the rest to the Bottomless Pit: but there was no eventual\r\ninjury. He and I staid in the Deserted Chamber, while our companions\r\ndisappeared, one by one, through a crevice, on their way to the pit. The\r\ndead silence, and the glimmer of our single lamp, were very striking;\r\nand we were more disposed to look round upon the low-roofed apartment,\r\npiled with stones as far as the eye could reach, than to talk. I tried\r\nto swallow a piece of bread or cake, very like a shoe-sole, and\r\nspeculated upon these piles of stones;--by whose hand they were reared,\r\nand how long ago. There is much cane--doubtless, once used for\r\nfuel--scattered about the deeper recesses of the cave; and these stones\r\nwere evidently heaped up by human hands: and those not Indian. It is\r\nsupposed that this cave was made use of by that mysterious race which\r\nexisted before the Indians, and of which so many curious traces remain\r\nin the middle States of the West; a race more civilized, to judge by the\r\nworks of their hands, than the Indians have ever been; but of which no\r\ntradition remains.\r\n\r\nOur party returned safe, and refreshed by a draught of water, better\r\nworth having than my luncheon of bread. When we left the cave, our\r\nguides insisted upon it that we had walked, this morning, ten or eleven\r\nmiles. I pronounced it four. Others of the party said seven; and the\r\npoint remains unsettled. We all agreed that it was twice as much as we\r\ncould have accomplished in the heat above ground; and perhaps the most\r\nremarkable walk we had ever taken in our lives. Our hostess was with us\r\nthe whole time; and it was amusing to see in her the effect of custom.\r\nShe trod the mazes of this cave just as people do the walks of their own\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe gush of sun-light pouring in at the mouth of the cave, green and\r\nsoft, as we emerged from the darkness, was exquisitely beautiful. So was\r\nthe foliage of the trees, after the rigid forms which had been printing\r\nthemselves upon our eye-sight for so many hours. As we sat at the\r\nentrance, to accustom ourselves to the warm outward air, I saw, growing\r\nhigh in the steep woods, the richest of kalmias, in full bloom. One of\r\nthe gentlemen ran to bring me some; and when it came, it was truly a\r\nfeast to the eye. How apt are we to look upon all things as made for us!\r\nHow many seasons has this kalmia bloomed?\r\n\r\nWe were truly sorry to bid farewell to our motherly hostess, and her\r\n\"smart\" sons. Theirs is a singular mode of life; and it left nearly as\r\nvivid an impression on our minds as their mighty neighbour, the cave. If\r\nany of us should ever happen to be banished, and to have a home to seek,\r\nI fancy we should look out for a plot of green sward, among flowering\r\nkalmias, near the mouth of an enormous cave, with humming birds flitting\r\nabout it by day, and fire-flies and summer lightning by night.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast in my mind with such a scene as this, stands a gay\r\nencampment in the wilderness, at which I soon after arrived. The\r\nwatering places among the Virginia mountains are as new and striking a\r\nspectacle as the United States can afford. The journeyings of those who\r\nvisit them are a perpetual succession of contrasts. I may as well give\r\nthe whole journey from Cincinnati to the eastern base of the\r\nAlleghanies.\r\n\r\nWe left Cincinnati at noon on the 25th of June: as sultry a summer's day\r\nas ever occurs on the Ohio. The glare was reflected from the water with\r\na blinding and scorching heat; and feather fans were whisking all day in\r\nthe ladies' cabin of our steam-boat. Hot as it was, I could not remain\r\nin the shady cabin. The shores of the Ohio are so beautiful, that I\r\ncould not bear to lose a single glimpse between the hills. It is\r\nholiday-travelling to have such a succession of pictures as I saw there\r\nmade to pass noiselessly before one's eyes. There were the children\r\nrunning among the gigantic trees on the bank, to see the boat pass; the\r\ngirl with her milk-pail, half way up the hill; the horseman on the\r\nridge, or the wagoner with his ox-team pausing on the slope. Then there\r\nwas the flitting blue jay under the cool shadow of the banks; the\r\nbutterflies crossing the river in zig-zag flight; the terrapins (small\r\nturtle) floundering in the water, with their pert little heads above the\r\nsurface; and the glancing fire-flies every night.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of this day, we were met by the storm which swept over\r\nthe whole country, and which will be remembered as having caused the\r\ndeath of the son of Chief-Justice Marshall, at Baltimore, on his way to\r\nhis dying father. I watched, from the deck, the approach of the storm.\r\nFirst, the sky, above the white clouds, was of a dark grey, which might\r\nhave been mistaken for the deep blue of twilight. Then a mass of black\r\nclouds came hurrying up below the white. Then a flash escaped from out\r\nof the upper grey, darting perpendicularly into the forest; and then\r\nanother, exploding like the four rays of a star. I saw the squall\r\ncoming in a dark line, straight across the river. Our boat was hurried\r\nunder the bank to await it. The burst was furious: a roaring gust, and a\r\nflood of rain, which poured in under our cabin door, close shut as it\r\nwas. All was nearly as dark as night for a while, and all silent but the\r\nelements. Then the day seemed to dawn again; but loud peals of thunder\r\nlasted long, and the lightning was all abroad in the air. Faint flashes\r\nnow wandered by; and now a brilliant white zig-zag quivered across the\r\nsky. One splendid violet-coloured shaft shot straight down into the\r\nforest; and I saw a tall tree first blaze and then smoulder at the\r\ntouch. A noble horse floated by, dead and swollen. When we drew out into\r\nthe middle of the river, it was as if spring had come in at the heels of\r\nthe dog-days; all was so cool and calm.\r\n\r\nThe company on board were of the lowest class we ever happened to meet\r\nwith in our travels. They were obliging enough; as everybody is\r\nthroughout the country, as far as my experience goes; but otherwise they\r\nwere no fair specimens of American manners. One woman excited my\r\ncuriosity from the beginning; but I entertained a much more agreeable\r\nfeeling towards her when we parted, after several days' travelling in\r\ncompany. Her first deed was to ask where we were going; and her next, to\r\ntake my book out of my lap, and examine it. Much of the rest of her time\r\nwas occupied in dressing her hair, which was, notwithstanding, almost as\r\nrough as a negro's. She wore in her head a silver comb, another set with\r\nbrilliants, and a third, an enormous tortoiseshell, so stuck in, on one\r\nside, as to remind the observer, irresistibly, of a unicorn. She pulled\r\ndown her hair in company, and put it up again, many times in a day,\r\nwhenever, as it seemed to me, she could not think of anything else to\r\nbe doing. Her young companion, meantime, sat rubbing her teeth with\r\ndragon-root. The other cabin company seemed much of the same class. I\r\nwas dressing in my state room between four and five the next morning,\r\nwhen an old lady, who was presently going ashore, burst in, and snatched\r\nthe one tumbler glass from my hand. She was probably as much amazed at\r\nmy having carried it out of sight as I was at her mode of recovering it.\r\n\r\nI loved the early morning on the great rivers, and therefore rose at\r\ndawn. I loved the first grey gleams that came from between the hills,\r\nand the bright figures of people in white, (the men all in linen jackets\r\nin hot weather,) on the banks. I loved to watch the river craft; the\r\nfussy steamer making rapid way; the fairy canoe shooting silently\r\nacross; the flat-boat, with its wreath of blue smoke, stealing down in\r\nthe shadow of the banks, her navigators helping her along in the current\r\nby catching at the branches as they passed: and the perilous looking\r\nraft, with half-a-dozen people on it, under their canopy of green\r\nboughs, their shapeless floor bending and walloping in the middle of the\r\nstream. I loved the trees, looking as if they stood self-poised, their\r\nroots were washed so bare. I loved the dwellings that stood behind their\r\nscreen, those on the eastern bank seeming fast asleep; those on the\r\nwestern shore gay with the flickering shadows cast on them by the breezy\r\nsunrise through the trees.\r\n\r\nOn passing Catletsburgh we bade adieu to glorious Kentucky. At that\r\npoint, our eyes rested on three sovereign States at one glance, Ohio,\r\nKentucky, and Virginia. We landed at Guyandot, and proceeded by stage\r\nthe next morning to Charleston, on the Kanawha river. The road, all the\r\nway to the Springs, is marvellously good for so wild a part of the\r\ncountry. The bridges over the streams are, some of them, prettily\r\nfinished; and the accommodations by the road side are above the average.\r\nThe scenery is beautiful the whole way. We were leaving the great\r\nWestern Valley; and the road offered a succession of ascents and levels.\r\nThere were many rivulets and small waterfalls; the brier-rose was in\r\nfull bloom along the ground; the road ran half way up the wooded hills,\r\nso that there were basins of foliage underneath, the whole apparently\r\nwoven into so compact a mass by the wild vine, that it seemed as if one\r\nmight walk across the valley on the tree tops. The next day's dawn broke\r\nover the salt works and coal pits, or rather caverns of coal, on the\r\nhill sides. The corn was less tall and rich, the trees were less lofty,\r\nand it was apparent that we were mounting to a higher region. It\r\noccurred to me, in a careless kind of way, that we were now not very far\r\nfrom the Hawk's Nest. Some ladies in the Guyandot Hotel had said to me,\r\n\"Be sure you see the Hawk's Nest.\" \"What is that?\" \"A place that\r\ntravellers can see if they choose; the driver always stops a few minutes\r\nto let them see the Hawk's Nest.\" I had never heard of it before, and I\r\nnever heard of it again. The world is fairly awakened to Niagara; but it\r\nis still drowsy about two scenes which moved me--the one more than\r\nNiagara, the other nearly as much; the platform at Pine Orchard House,\r\non the top of the Catshills, and the Hawk's Nest.\r\n\r\nThe last of the Kanawha River, as we bade adieu to it on the 28th of\r\nJune, was smooth and sweet, with its islets of rocks, and the pretty\r\nbridge by which we crossed the Gauley, and entered upon the ascent above\r\nNew River. The Gauley and the New River join to make the Kanawha. The\r\nascent of the mountains above New River is trying to weak nerves. The\r\nhorses have to stop, here and there, to rest; and it appears that if\r\nthey were to back three steps, it would be death. The road, however, is\r\nreally broad, though it appears a mere ledge when the eye catches the\r\ndepth below, where the brown river is rushing and brawling in its rocky\r\nbed. A passenger dropped his cap in the steepest part, and the driver\r\nmade no difficulty about stopping to let him recover it. What a depth it\r\nwas! like the dreamy visions of one's childhood of what winged\r\nmessengers may first learn of man's dwelling-place, when they light on a\r\nmountain-top; like Satan's glimpses from the Mount of Soliloquy; like\r\nany unusual or forbidden peep from above into the retirements of nature,\r\nor the arrangements of man. On our left rose the blasted rocks which had\r\nbeen compelled to yield us a passage; but their aspect was already\r\nsoftened by the trails of crimson and green creepers which were\r\nspreading over their front. The unmeasured pent-house of wild vine was\r\nstill below us on the right, with rich rhododendron blossoms bursting\r\nthrough, and rock-plants shooting up from every ledge and crevice at the\r\nedge of the precipice. After a long while, (I have nothing to say of\r\ntime or distance, for I thought of neither,) a turn in the road shut out\r\nthe whole from our sight. I leaned out of the stage, further and\r\nfurther, to catch, as I supposed, a last glimpse of the tremendous\r\nvalley; and when I drew in again, it was with a feeling of deep grief\r\nthat such a scene was to be beheld by me no more. I saw a house, a\r\ncomfortable homestead, in this wild place, with its pasture and\r\ncorn-fields about it; and I longed to get out, and ask the people to let\r\nme live with them.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the stage stopped. \"If any of the passengers wish to go\r\nto the Hawk's Nest ...\" shouted the driver. He gave us ten minutes, and\r\npointed with his whip to a beaten path in the wood to the right. It\r\nseems to me now that I was unaccountably cool and careless about it. I\r\nwas absorbed by what I had seen, or I might have known, from the\r\ndirection we were taking, that we were coming out above the river again.\r\nWe had not many yards to go. We issued suddenly from the covert of the\r\nwood, upon a small platform of rock;--a Devil's Pulpit it would be\r\ncalled, if its present name were not so much better;--a platform of\r\nrock, springing from the mountain side, without any visible support, and\r\nlooking sheer down upon an angle of the roaring river, between eleven\r\nand twelve hundred feet below. Nothing whatever intervenes. Spread out\r\nbeneath, shooting up around, are blue mountain peaks, extending in\r\nboundless expanse. No one, I believe, could look down over the edge of\r\nthis airy shelf, but for the stunted pines which are fast rooted in it.\r\nWith each arm clasping a pine-stem, I looked over, and saw more, I\r\ncannot but think, than the world has in reserve to show me.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this place was discovered by Chief Justice Marshall,\r\nwhen, as a young man, he was surveying among the mountains. But how many\r\nIndians knew it before? How did it strike the mysterious race who gave\r\nplace to the Indians? Perhaps one of these may have stood there to see\r\nthe summer storm careering below; to feel that his foothold was too\r\nlofty to be shaken by the thunderpeals that burst beneath; to trace the\r\nquiverings of the lightnings afar, while the heaven was clear above his\r\nown head. Perhaps this was the stand chosen by the last Indian, from\r\nwhich to cast his lingering glance upon the glorious regions from which\r\nthe white intruders were driving his race. If so, here he must have\r\npined and died, or hence he must have cast himself down. I cannot\r\nconceive that from this spot any man could turn away, to go into exile.\r\nBut it cannot be that Marshall was more than the earliest of Saxon race\r\nwho discovered this place. Nature's thrones are not left to be first\r\nmounted by men who can be made Chief Justices. We know not what races of\r\nwild monarchs may have had them first.\r\n\r\nWe travelled the rest of the day through an Alpine region, still full of\r\nbeauty. The road is so new that the stopping places seemed to have no\r\nnames. The accommodations were wonderfully good. At eleven we reached a\r\nplace where we were allowed, not only to sup, but to lie down for two\r\nhours; a similar mercy to that afforded us the night before. Those who\r\nare impatient of fatigue should not attempt this method of reaching the\r\nVirginia Springs, though they are much to be pitied if they adopt any\r\nother. Our first re-entrance upon the world was at Lewisburg, at noon,\r\non the 29th. It appears to be a neat village. The militia were parading:\r\nvery respectable men, I do not doubt, but not much like soldiers. In a\r\nquarter of an hour we were off for the White Sulphur Springs, nine miles\r\n(of dusty road) from Lewisburg, and arrived there at half-past two, just\r\nas the company were dispersing about the walks, after dinner.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more striking than the contrast between our stage-coach\r\nsociety and that which was thronging the green area into which we were\r\ndriven. We were heated, wearied, shabby, and all of one dust colour,\r\nfrom head to foot, and, I doubt not, looking very sheepish under the\r\ngeneral stare. Every body else was gay and spruce, and at full leisure\r\nto criticise us. Gentlemen in the piazza in glossy coats and polished\r\npumps; ladies in pink, blue, and white, standing on green grass, shading\r\ntheir delicate faces and gay head-dresses under parasols; never was\r\nthere a more astonishing contrast than all this presented with what we\r\nhad been seeing of late. The friends who were expecting us, however,\r\nwere not ashamed of us, and came bounding over the green to welcome us,\r\nand carry us within reach of refreshment.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful whether \"a cabin\" could be spared to us. We were\r\nfortunate in being so favoured as to be put in possession of one in the\r\ncourse of the afternoon. Several carriages full of visitors arrived\r\nwithin a few days, each with its load of trunks, its tin pail dangling\r\nbehind (wherewith to water the horses in the wilderness) and its crowd\r\nof expecting and anxious faces at the windows, and were turned back to\r\nseek a resting-place elsewhere. That we were accommodated at all, I\r\nbelieve to this day to be owing to some secret self-denying ordinance on\r\nthe part of our friends.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the green, are the large rooms, in which the company at\r\nthe Springs dine, play cards, and dance. Also, the bar-room, and stage,\r\npost, and superintendent's offices. The cabins are disposed round the\r\nother sides, and dropped down, in convenient situations behind. These\r\ncabins consist of one, two, or more rooms, each containing a bed, a\r\ntable, a looking-glass, and two or three chairs. All company is received\r\nin a room with a bed in it: there is no help for it. The better cabins\r\nhave a piazza in front; and all have a back door opening upon the hill\r\nside; so that the attendants, and their domestic business, are kept out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur fountain is in the middle of the southern end of the green;\r\nand near it is the sulphur bathing-house. The fountain rises in the\r\nmidst of a small temple, which is surmounted by a statue of Hygeia,\r\npresented to the establishment by a grateful visitor from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe water, pure and transparent, and far more agreeable to the eye than\r\nto the taste, forms a pool in its octagon-shaped cistern; and hither\r\nthe visitors lounge, three times a day, to drink their two or three\r\nhalf-pint tumblers of nauseousness.\r\n\r\nI heard many complaints, from new-comers, of the drowsiness caused by\r\ndrinking the water. Some lay down to sleep more than once in the day;\r\nand others apologised for their dulness in society; but this is only a\r\ntemporary effect, if one may judge by the activity visible on the green\r\nfrom morning till night. One of the greatest amusements was to listen to\r\nthe variety of theories afloat about the properties and modes of\r\napplication of the waters.\r\n\r\nThese springs had been visited only about fifteen years. No\r\nphilosophising on cases appears to have been instituted: no recording,\r\nclassifying, inferring, and stating. The patients come from distances of\r\na thousand miles in every direction, with a great variety of complaints;\r\nthey grow better or do not; they go away, and nobody is the wiser for\r\ntheir experience. It would be difficult to trace them, and to make a\r\nrecord of anything more than their experience while on the spot. The\r\napplication of these waters will probably continue for a long time to be\r\npurely empirical. All that is really known to the patients themselves\r\nis, that they are first sleepy, then ravenous; that they must then leave\r\nthe White Sulphur Spring, and go to the Warm Springs, to be bathed; then\r\nto the Sweet Springs, to be braced; and then home, to send all their\r\nailing friends into Virginia next year.\r\n\r\nUpwards of two hundred visitors were accommodated when I was in the\r\nWhite Sulphur Valley; and cabins were being built in all directions. The\r\nvalley, a deep basin among the mountains; presents such beauties to the\r\neye, as perhaps few watering-places in the world can boast. There has\r\nbeen no time yet to lay them open, for the benefit of the invalids; but\r\nthere are plans for the formation of walks and drives through the woods,\r\nand along the mountain sides. At present, all is wild, beyond the\r\nprecincts of the establishment; and, for the pleasure of the healthy,\r\nfor those who can mount, and ramble, and scramble, it seems a pity that\r\nit should not remain so. The mocking-bird makes the woods ring with its\r\ndelicious song; and no hand has bridged the rapid streams. If you want\r\nto cross them, you must throw in your own stepping-stones. If you desire\r\nto be alone, you have only to proceed from the gate of the establishment\r\nto the first turn in the road, force your way into the thicket, and look\r\nabroad from your retreat upon as sweet and untouched a scene of mountain\r\nand valley as the eye of the red man loves to rest upon. The gentlemen\r\nwho are not invalids go out shooting in the wilderness. A friend of mine\r\nreturned from such an expedition, the day after my arrival. He brought\r\nhome a deer; had been overtaken by a storm in the mountains, and had,\r\nwith his companions, made a house and a fire. Such amusements would\r\ndiversify the occupations of Bath and Cheltenham very agreeably.\r\n\r\nThe morning after our arrival, we were too weary to be roused by the\r\nnotice bell, which rings an hour before every meal; and we were ready\r\nonly just in time for the last bell. Breakfast is carried to the cabins,\r\nif required; but every person who is able prefers breakfasting in\r\ncompany. On rainy mornings, it is a curious sight to see the company\r\nscudding across the green to the public-room, under umbrellas, and in\r\ncloaks and india-rubber shoes. Very unlike the slow pace, under a\r\nparasol, in a July sun.\r\n\r\nThere was less meat on the table at breakfast and tea than I was\r\naccustomed to see. The bread and tea were good. For the other eatables\r\nthere is little to be said. It is a table spread in the wilderness; and\r\na provision of tender meat and juicy vegetables for two or three\r\nhundred people is not to be had for the wishing. The dietary is sure to\r\nbe improved, from year to year; the most that is to be expected at\r\npresent is, that there should be enough for everybody. The sum paid for\r\nboard per week is eight dollars; and other charges may make the expenses\r\nmount up to twelve. Pitchers of water and of milk may be seen, at every\r\nmeal, all down the tables; little or no wine.\r\n\r\nThe establishment is under the management of the proprietor, who has\r\nbeen offered 500,000 dollars for it, that it may be conducted by a\r\ncompany of share-holders, who would introduce the necessary\r\nimprovements. When I was there, the proprietor was still holding off\r\nfrom this bargain, the company not being willing to continue to him the\r\nsuperintendence of the concern. I hope that arrangements, satisfactory\r\nto all parties, may have been made by this time. The average gross\r\nreceipts of a season were reported to be 50,000 dollars. It was added\r\nthat these might easily be doubled, if all were done that might be.\r\n\r\nRheumatism and liver complaints seemed the most common grievances. Two\r\nlittle girls, perhaps four and five years old, sat opposite to me, who\r\nwere sufferers from rheumatism. But the visitors who came for pleasure\r\nseemed to outnumber considerably those who came for health.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we sauntered about the green, and visited various new\r\nacquaintances in their piazzas. Then we went home for our bonnets, and\r\nrambled through the woods, till we were sent back by the rain, and took\r\nshelter beside the fountain. The effect was strange of seeing there a\r\nfamily of emigrants, parents and nine children, who were walking from\r\nNorth Carolina into Illinois. There must have been twins among these\r\nchildren, so many of them looked just alike. The contrast between this\r\ngroup of way-worn travellers, stopping out of curiosity to taste the\r\nwaters, and the gay company among whom they very properly held up their\r\nindependent heads, was striking to a stranger.\r\n\r\nWe dined at two; and afterwards found that a fire would be comfortable,\r\nthough it was the last day of June. As many friends as our room would\r\nhold came home with us, and sat on the bed, table, and the few chairs we\r\ncould muster, while one made the wood fire, and another bought\r\nice-creams, which a country lad brought to the door. These ice-creams\r\nseemed to be thin custard, with a sprinkling of snow in it; but the boy\r\ndeclared that they were ice-creams when he left home. When we had\r\nfinished our dessert, washed and returned the glasses, and joked and\r\ntalked till the new-comers of our party grew ashamed of their\r\ndrowsiness, we crossed the green to diversify the afternoon amusements\r\nof certain of our friends. Some were romping with their dogs; some\r\nreading books brought by themselves; (for there is no library yet;) some\r\nplaying at chess or backgammon; all deploring the rain.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, we stormed the great scales, and our whole party were\r\nindividually weighed. It must be an interesting occupation to the\r\nvaletudinarians of the place to watch their own and each others' weight,\r\nfrom day to day, or from week to week. For my part, I found my weight\r\njust what it always has been, the few times in my life that I have\r\nremembered to ascertain it. Such unenviable persons can never make a\r\npursuit of the scales, as others can whose gravity is more\r\ndiscriminating.--From the scales, we adjourned to the ball-room, where I\r\nmet friends and acquaintances from Mobile and New Orleans; saw\r\nnew-comers from the Carolinas and Georgia; was introduced to personages\r\nof note from Boston; recognized some whom I had known at Philadelphia;\r\nand sat between two gentlemen who had fought a duel. There was music,\r\ndancing, and refreshments; laughing and flirting here; grave\r\nconversation there;--all the common characteristics of a ball, with the\r\nadded circumstances that almost every State in the Union was here\r\nrepresented; and that we were gathered together in the heart of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nOne more visit remained to be paid this day. We had promised to look in\r\nupon some friends who were not at the ball, in order to try the charms\r\nand virtues of egg-nogg, which had been lauded to us by an eminent\r\nstatesman, who has had opportunity, during his diplomatic missions, to\r\nlearn what there is best in this world. The egg-nogg having been duly\r\nenjoyed, we at length went home, to write letters as long as we could\r\nhold up our heads, after so extremely busy a day:--a day which may be\r\nconsidered a fair specimen of life at the White Sulphur Springs.\r\n\r\nOne of the personages whom I referred to as low company, at the\r\nbeginning of my story, declared himself in the stage-coach to be a\r\ngambler, about to visit the Springs for professional purposes. He said\r\nto another man, who looked fit company for him, that he played higher at\r\nfaro than any man in the country but one. These two men slept while we\r\nwere mounting to the Hawk's Nest. People who pursue their profession by\r\nnight, as such people do, must sleep in the day, happen what may. They\r\nwere rather self-important during the journey; it was a comfort to see\r\nhow poor a figure they cut at the Springs. They seemed to sink into the\r\ndeepest insignificance that could be desired. Such persons are the pests\r\nof society in the south and west; and they are apt to boast that their\r\nprofession is highly profitable in the eastern cities. I fear this is no\r\nempty vaunt.\r\n\r\nWe left the White Sulphur Springs, a party of six, in \"an extra\r\nexclusive return stage,\" and with two saddle horses. Nothing could be\r\nmore promising. The stage was perfectly new, having been used only to\r\nbring General C---- and his lady from Philadelphia to the Springs. We\r\nhad a shrewd and agreeable Yankee driver, for the whole way. The weather\r\nwas as fine as July weather ought to be; and as cool as is its wont near\r\nthe tops of mountains: the very weather for the saddle, or for having\r\nthe stage open on all sides; or for walking. The alternations were\r\nfrequently tried. Roses and mountain laurels adorned our road; the\r\nbreezy woods cast their shadows over us; and we remembered what waters\r\nwere springing beneath us;--that we were passing over the sources of the\r\nmighty rivers of the West, which we had lately navigated with deep awe\r\nand delight. The few dwellings we passed were almost all houses of\r\nentertainment; but nothing could be more quiet than their air, nestling\r\nas they did in the most enviable situations, and resembling more the\r\nlodges in the avenues of the parks of English gentry than the hotels of\r\nthe high road.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Sweet Springs, twelve miles, I believe, from the White\r\nSulphur, at half-past two. We were as hungry as mountain travellers\r\nshould be, and dinner was over. However, we were soon set down to hot\r\nstewed venison, beet, hominy, ham, and fruit pies; and, thus reinforced,\r\nwe issued forth to examine the place. The spring at the bathhouse looked\r\nso tempting, that I resolved to bathe at sun-down, which, in this\r\nvalley, would be at five o'clock. The establishment here is inferior to\r\nthe one we had left. The green was not paled in; the cabins were more\r\nshabby; the dining-room smaller. We had it almost to ourselves. The\r\nseason had not begun, few having been yet sufficiently sulphured and\r\nbathed elsewhere to come here to be braced. The water is a little warm;\r\nit has a slight briskness; and bubbles up prettily in its well under the\r\npiazza. The luxury is to have nothing to do with its disagreeable taste,\r\nbut to bathe in it, as it gushes, tepid, from its spout. It would be\r\nworth while, if there were nothing but trouble in crossing the mountains\r\nto get to it. The Sweet Springs lie in one of the highest valleys of the\r\nAlleghanies, and one of the fairest. Five times that afternoon did I\r\nclimb the steep breezy slope behind our cabin, bringing first one of our\r\nparty, then another, to look abroad; and then returning to enjoy the\r\nsun-set alone. The crowds of blue peaks, the bright clearings, the\r\nclumps of forest trees, lilac in the sunset with the shepherds lying in\r\ntheir shadow, and the sheep grazing on the sunny slopes, the cluster of\r\ncabins below, with their thin smokes rising straight into the golden\r\nair,--the whole looked as if the near heavens had opened to let down a\r\ngush of their inner light upon this high region. Never shall I forget\r\nthose tufty purple hills. Cold twilight came on; and we sat round a\r\nblazing wood fire, telling ghost and murder stories till we could have\r\ndeclared it was a Christmas night.\r\n\r\nAt supper, I observed a hale, brisk, intellectual-looking gentleman who\r\nsatisfied himself with a basin of liquid; as he did at breakfast the\r\nnext morning; and as he may be seen to do at every meal he takes. He\r\ntold us his story. Twenty years before, he nearly closed his oesophagus\r\nby taking too powerful an emetic. For twenty years, he has had no\r\nillness; he rises at dawn all the year round, and has never been known\r\nto be low-spirited for two minutes. We all began to think of living upon\r\nliquids; but I have not heard of any of the party having proceeded\r\nbeyond the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe rose at five, the next morning, having thirty mountain miles to go\r\nduring the day, with the same horses. It must not be supposed that this\r\nmountain travelling is scrambling among craggy peaks, piercing through\r\ndark defiles, and so forth. The roads wind so gently among the slopes,\r\nthat a sleeping or blind traveller would not discover that the carriage\r\nwas not, for the greater part of the time, proceeding on level ground.\r\nWoody slopes at hand, and a crowd of blue summits afar, are the most\r\ncharacteristic features of the scenery. A white speck of a house, on its\r\ntiny green clearing, comes into sight, high up among the hills, from a\r\nturn in the road, and the traveller says to himself, \"What a perch to\r\nlive on!\" In two hours, he stops at that very house to dine, not being\r\naware how he has got up to it, and looking round with wonder on the snug\r\ncomforts of the homestead.\r\n\r\nOur thirty miles of this day were delicious. Having breakfasted, we bade\r\nadieu, at half-past six, to the Sweet Springs, steaming in the bitter\r\ncold morning air, and followed a gentleman of our party who had\r\nproceeded on foot to the top of the first ridge. There we found him,\r\nsitting under a tree, having succeeded in warming himself by the walk.\r\nUp the second ridge, the whole party walked, I having started off, ahead\r\nof the rest. It was warm, and I stopped, here and there, to rest and\r\ngather wild flowers. The rhododendrons and kalmias grew in profusion;\r\nand there were plenty of roses, the fine orange columbine of the hills,\r\nvetches, and a few splendid scarlet lilies. The peeps down into abysses\r\nof foliage were glorious; and, yet more, the cloudlike expanse of\r\nmountain tops, growing bluer and fainter till they faded quite away. A\r\nsteep road on an opposite mountain was the only sign of humanity being\r\nnear. On the summit, however, there was a small farm. In it lived an\r\nelderly woman, who had never been further from the spot than eight\r\nmiles. If she was born to travel no further than eight miles, no better\r\ndwelling place could have been assigned her; for hence she sees more at\r\na glance, any sunset, than some, with all means of locomotion, have ever\r\nbeheld.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange feeling, the beginning to descend. It was strange to\r\ncross, soon after, the path of the tornado. I had seen something of its\r\nravages before, on the banks of the Cumberland river: the stoutest\r\nforest-trees wrenched and twisted, like red-hot iron in the vice of the\r\nblacksmith; and snapped off, all at the same height; so that the forest\r\nlooked like a gigantic scorched stubble-field. Here, a similar\r\ndesolation was seen in immediate contrast with the rich fertility of the\r\nlittle valley beneath. The hurricane had seared a path for itself up the\r\nmountain side, passing over the lowly roofs in the depths. We arrived to\r\ndinner at a house on Barber Creek, where we entreated to be fed without\r\ndelay, on anything whatsoever that was eatable; as time was precious,\r\nthis day. Yet were we kept waiting two hours and a half. I found much to\r\ndo by the creek side watching the minnows making their way up against\r\nthe current; watching two girls who had set up their washing\r\nestablishment in pretty style under a tree beside the water; their wood\r\nfire, black cauldron, and stand of tubs; while the bushes stood round\r\nabout to be used as drying horses. I also actually saw a hog voluntarily\r\nwalk three times through the clear water; and the delay of the dinner\r\nafforded time for speculation whether the race was not improving. When\r\nthe dinner was on the table, no one of us could tell what it consisted\r\nof. The dish from which I ate was, according to some, mutton; to others,\r\npork: my own idea is that it was dog. Whatever it was, it was at last\r\ndone with, and paid for, and I was in my saddle, listening to the creek\r\nas it rattled under the grey rocks. Having crossed one mountain top on\r\nfoot, in the morning, I was about to pass another on my horse this\r\nafternoon. There is no describing what it is to be pacing upwards, on\r\nthe extreme edge of the steep road, with one's feet hanging over the\r\ngreen abyss; the shadowy mountains retreating, advancing, interlacing,\r\nopening, to disclose a low far-off bit of meadow, with a diminutive\r\ndwelling, quiet as a lonely star. What blessed work road-making must be\r\nin such places! It was with no little pleasure that, after fourteen\r\nmiles from Barber Creek, I saw a fine house on an eminence; and then the\r\ntown of Fincastle, spread out below us, on some rising grounds.\r\n\r\nThe scenes of the day left me little disposed for sociability in the\r\nevening. We were kept waiting long for supper, by the arrival of a party\r\nof New Yorkers; to avoid an introduction to whom, some of us pretended\r\nto read, and some to be asleep, while others did our duty, talk. The\r\nnight closed in worthily. From the balcony of my chamber, I saw how\r\nmodestly the young moon eyed with me the region which will be spread\r\nbefore her for ever, but which I was looking back upon for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHere I must break off; and, instead of adding another description of the\r\nNatural Bridge to the hundred which exist, bring into contrast with life\r\nat the Virginia Springs, life in a New England farm-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can he quieter or more refreshing, after a winter's visiting at\r\nBoston or New York, than such an abode in a country village as I made\r\ntrial of last May. The weeks slipped away only too fast. Dr. and Mrs.\r\nF., their little boy, six years old, and myself, were fortunate enough\r\nto prevail with a farmer's widow at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to take\r\nus into her house. The house was conspicuous from almost every part of\r\nthe sweet valley into which it looked; the valley of the Housatonic. It\r\nwas at the top of a steep hill; a sort of air palace. From our parlour\r\nwindows we could see all that went on in the village; and I often found\r\nit difficult to take off my attention from this kind of spying. It was\r\ntempting to trace the horseman's progress along the road, which wound\r\namong the meadows, and over the bridge. It was tempting to watch the\r\nneighbours going in and out, and the children playing in the courts, or\r\nunder the tall elms; all the people looking as small and busy as ants\r\nupon a hillock. On week-days there was the ox-team in the field; and on\r\nSundays the gathering at the church-door. The larger of the two churches\r\nstood in the middle of a green, with stalls behind it for the horses and\r\nvehicles which brought the churchgoers from a distance. It was a pretty\r\nsight to see them converging from every point in the valley, so that the\r\nscene was all alive; and then disappear for the space of an hour and a\r\nhalf, as if an earthquake had swallowed up all life; and then pour out\r\nfrom the church door, and, after grouping on the green for a few\r\nminutes, betake themselves homewards. Monument Mountain reared itself\r\nopposite to us, with its thick woods, and here and there a grey crag\r\nprotruding. Other mountains closed in the valley, one of which treated\r\nus for some nights with the spectacle of a spreading fire in its woods.\r\nFrom the bases of these hills, up to our very door-step, there was one\r\nbright carpet of green. Everything, houses, trees, churches, were\r\nplanted down into this green, so that there was no interruption but the\r\none road, and the blue mazy Housatonic. The softness of the scene, early\r\nin a May morning, or when the sun was withdrawing, could not be\r\nsurpassed by anything seen under a Greek or Italian sky. Sometimes I\r\ncould scarcely believe it real: it looked air-painted, cloud-moulded.\r\n\r\nIt was as a favour that the widow Jones[8] took us in. She does not let\r\nlodgings. She opened her house to us, and made us a part of her family.\r\nTwo of her daughters were at home, and a married son lived at hand. We\r\nhad a parlour, with three windows, commanding different views of the\r\nvalley: two good-sized chambers, conveniently furnished, and a large\r\ncloset between; our board with the family, and every convenience that\r\ncould be provided: and all for two dollars per week each, and half price\r\nfor the child. She was advised to ask more, but she refused, as she did\r\nnot wish to be \"grasping.\" It was a merry afternoon when we followed the\r\nwagon up the hill to our new abode, and unpacked, and settled ourselves\r\nfor our long-expected month of May. Never was unpacking a pleasanter\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nThe blossomy cherry-tree beside my chamber window was the first object I\r\nsaw in the morning when I threw up the sash; and beneath it was a broad\r\nfallow, over which the blue jay flitted. By this window there was an\r\neasy chair and a light table, a most luxurious arrangement for reading.\r\nWe breakfasted at half-past seven on excellent bread, potatoes, hung\r\nbeef, eggs, and strong tea. We admitted no visitors during the forenoon,\r\nas our theory was that we were very busy people. Writing and reading did\r\noccupy much of our time, but it was surprising how much was left for the\r\nexercise of our tongues. Then there were visits to be made to the\r\npost-office, and the crockery store, and the cobbler; and Charley found\r\noccasion to burst in, a dozen times a-day, with a bunch of violets, or\r\nnews of the horse or cow, or of the ride he had had, or of the oxen in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nWe all dined together at two. One of the daughters absented herself at\r\nbreakfast, that she might arrange our rooms; but both were present at\r\ndinner, dressed, and ready for their afternoon's occupation of working\r\nand reading. One was fond of flowers, and had learned a great deal about\r\nthem. She was skilful in drying them, and could direct us to the places\r\nin the woods and meadows where they grew. Some members of the family,\r\nmore literary than the rest, were gone westward; but there was a taste\r\nfor books among them all. I often saw a volume on the table of the\r\nwidow's parlour, with her spectacles in it. She told me, one day, of her\r\nsatisfaction in her children, that they were given to good pursuits, and\r\nall received church members. All young people in these villages are more\r\nor less instructed. Schooling is considered a necessary of life. I\r\nhappened to be looking over an old almanack one day, when I found, among\r\nthe directions relating to the preparations for winter on a farm, the\r\nfollowing: \"Secure your cellars from frost. Fasten loose clap-boards and\r\nshingles. Secure a good school-master.\" It seemed doubtful, at the first\r\nglance, whether some new farming utensil had not been thus whimsically\r\nnamed; as the brass plate which hooks upon the fender, or upper bar of\r\nthe grate, is called \"the footman;\" but the context clearly showed that\r\na man with learning in his head was the article required to be provided\r\nbefore the winter. The only respect, as far as I know, in which we made\r\nour kind hostess uneasy, was in our neglect of Charley's book-studies.\r\nCharley's little head was full of knowledge of other kinds; but the\r\nwidow's children had all known more of the produce of the press at his\r\nage than he; and she had a few anxious thoughts about him.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we rambled abroad, if the weather was fine; if rainy,\r\nwe lighted our wood fire, and pursued our employments of the morning,\r\nnot uncheered by a parting gleam from the west; a bar of bright yellow\r\nsky above the hill tops, or a gush of golden light burnishing the dewy\r\nvalley at the last. Our walks were along the hill road to the lake, on\r\nthe way to Lenox, or through the farmyard and wood to a tumbling brook\r\nin a small ravine. We tried all manner of experiments with moss, stones,\r\nand twigs, among its sunny and shadowy reaches, and tiny falls. We\r\nhunted up marsh flowers, wood anemones, and violets, and unfolded the\r\ndelicate ferns, still closely buttoned up, and waiting for the full\r\npower of the summer sun. It was some trouble to me, in America, that I\r\ncould not get opportunity to walk so much as I think necessary to\r\nhealth. It is not the custom there: partly owing to the climate, the\r\nextreme heat of summer, and cold of winter; and partly to the absence of\r\nconvenient and pretty walks in and about the cities; a want which, I\r\ntrust, will be supplied in time. In Stockbridge much pedestrian exercise\r\nmay be and is accomplished; and I took the opportunity of indulging in\r\nit, much to the surprise of some persons, who were not aware how English\r\nladies can walk. One very warm afternoon, we were going on a visit to\r\nLenox, five miles off. My friends went in a wagon; I preferred walking.\r\nThe widow's son watched me along the road, and then remarked, \"You will\r\nsee no more of her till you get to Lenox. I would not walk off at that\r\nrate, if they gave me Lenox when I got there.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evenings, we made a descent upon the village, or the village came\r\nup to us. In the latter case, our hostess was always ready with a simple\r\nand graceful welcome, and her best endeavours to provide seats for our\r\nmany friends. If we staid below till after nine, the family had gone to\r\nrest on our return. We had only to lift the latch, light our candles,\r\nand make our way to the milk-pans, if we were thirsty. For twenty-five\r\nyears, the widow has lived on the top of her hill, with only a latch to\r\nher door. She sleeps undefended, for she has no enemies; and in her\r\nvillage there are no thieves.\r\n\r\nOne night, when we were visiting some friends in the valley, it was\r\nbrought home to us what it is to live in a place where there are no\r\nhackney coaches, or other travelling shelter. When we should have been\r\ngoing home, it was a tremendous spring-storm; wind, thunder and\r\nlightning, and rain in floods. We waited long; but it seemed to have no\r\nintention of abating. When at length we did set out, we were a\r\nremarkable looking troop; a gentlemanly young lawyer in a pea jacket;\r\nthe other gentlemen in the roughest coats that could be found; the\r\nladies leaving bonnets and caps behind, with handkerchiefs over their\r\nheads, India-rubbers on their feet, their dresses tucked up, and cloaks\r\nswathed round them. Our party were speeded up the hill by the fear that\r\nCharley would be wakened and alarmed by the storm; but it was a\r\nbreathless sort of novelty to be working our way through one continued\r\npond to the foot of the hill, and then up the slippery ascent,\r\nunbonneted, with the strangling gust in our faces, and no possibility of\r\nour finding our way in the pitchy darkness but by the flashes of blue\r\nlightning. Well clad as we were, we felt, I believe, something like\r\nbeing paupers, or gentry of the highway, or some such houseless\r\npersonages exposed to the pelting of the pitiless storm. Charley was\r\nfound to be sound asleep, and we ourselves no worse off than being\r\nsteeped over the ankles.\r\n\r\nThe time came too soon when I must leave the beloved village, when I\r\nmust see no longer the morning baking and the evening milking; and the\r\nsoap cauldron boiling in the open air behind the house, with Charley\r\nmounted on a log, peeping into it; and the reading and working, and\r\ntying up of flowers in the afternoon. The time was come when the\r\nmotherly and sisterly kiss were ready for me, and my country life in New\r\nEngland was at an end. It is well for us that our best pleasures have an\r\nimmortality like our own; that the unseen life is a glorification of the\r\nseen. But for this, no one with a human heart would travel abroad, and\r\nattach himself to scenes and persons which he cannot but love, but which\r\nhe must leave.\r\n\r\nIt was not always that the villagers of New England could place\r\nthemselves on hill tops, and leave their doors unfastened. There is a\r\nstriking contrast between their present security and the fears of their\r\nforefathers, in the days when the nursling went to church, because it\r\nwas unsafe at home, in the absence of its father. Father, mother, and\r\nchildren, all went on one horse to meet the total population within the\r\nwalls of the church; the one parent armed, the other prying about for\r\ntraces of the fearful red man. Those were the days when the English\r\nregicides had fled to the colonies, and were there secreted. Those were\r\nthe days when anything that was to be made known to all was announced in\r\nchurch, because everybody was sure to be there; and a fast-day was\r\nordained if anything very remarkable was to be done, or conveyed.\r\nSometimes formal announcements were made; sometimes intimations were so\r\ninterwoven with the texture of the discourse, as that unfriendly ears,\r\nif such should be present, should not apprehend the meaning. When any\r\nemissary of Charles the Second was prowling in search of a concealed\r\nregicide, the pastor preached from some such text as, \"Hide the\r\noutcasts. Bewray not him that wandereth;\"[9] and the flock understood\r\nthat they were to be on their guard against spies. Charles the Second\r\ncould never get hold of one of his enemies who had taken refuge in these\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nOn looking abroad over the valley of the Connecticut, from the top of\r\nMount Holyoke, I saw the village of Hadley, seated in the meadows, and\r\nextending across a promontory, formed by the winding of the river. This\r\npromontory afforded a secure grazing ground for the cattle by day, which\r\nwere driven by night into the area of the village, where the church\r\nstood. Goffe, the regicide, was concealed for many years in the\r\nparsonage at Hadley; all the people in the village, except two or three,\r\nbeing, in this instance, unaware of an outcast being among them. One\r\nSunday, the Indians attacked the village while the people were all in\r\nchurch. The women and children were left in the church, while their\r\nhusbands, fathers, and brothers went out to do battle with the cruel\r\nfoe. It went hard with the whites; the Indians were fast bearing them\r\ndown, when an unknown figure appeared in their ranks, with flowing\r\nrobes, streaming white hair, and a glittering sword. The cry was raised\r\nthat the angel Gabriel had been sent in answer to the prayers of the\r\nwomen in the church. Every spirit was cheered, every arm was nerved, and\r\nthe Indians were beaten off, with great slaughter. Upon this, Gabriel\r\nvanished; but tradition long preserved the memory of his miraculous\r\nappearance. The very few who recognized in him Goffe, with his undressed\r\nhair, and in his morning gown, kept the secret faithfully. How blessed a\r\nchange has come over rural life in Massachusetts since those days! Never\r\nmay its peace and security be invaded by those social abuses which are\r\nmore hateful than foreign spies; more cruel and treacherous than the\r\ninjured and exasperated red man of the wilderness!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contrast is also striking between the country life of New England\r\nand that of the west. I staid for some weeks in the house of a wealthy\r\nland-owner in Kentucky. Our days were passed in great luxury; and some\r\nof hottest of them very idly. The house was in the midst of grounds, gay\r\nwith verdure and flowers, in the opening month of June; and our\r\nfavourite seats were the steps of the hall, and chairs under the trees.\r\nFrom thence we could watch the play of the children on the grass-plat,\r\nand some of the drolleries of the little negroes. The red bird and the\r\nblue bird flew close by; and the black and white woodpecker with crimson\r\nhead, tapped at all the tree-trunks, as if we were no interruption. We\r\nrelished the table fare, after that with which we had been obliged to\r\ncontent ourselves on board the steam-boats. The tender meat, fresh\r\nvegetables, good claret and champagne, with the daily piles of\r\nstrawberries and towers of ice-cream, were welcome luxuries. There were\r\nthirty-three horses in the stables, and we roved about the neighbouring\r\ncountry accordingly. There was more literature at hand than time to\r\nprofit by it. Books could be had at home; but not the woods of\r\nKentucky;--clear, sunny woods, with maple and sycamore springing up to a\r\nheight which makes man feel dwarfish. The glades, with their turf so\r\nclean, every fallen leaf having been absorbed, reminded me of Ivanhoe, I\r\nalmost looked for Gurth in my rambles. All this was, not many years ago,\r\none vast canebrake, with a multitude of buffalo and deer: the pea-vine\r\nspreading everywhere, and the fertility far greater than even now.\r\n\r\nOne morning I took a lesson in rifle-shooting; the gentlemen having\r\nbrought out their weapons for a few hours' sport among the squirrels. A\r\nrifle does not bounce like a musket, and affords, therefore, an easy\r\nbeginning. I took aim at twenty-five paces, and hitting within an inch,\r\nthought it best to leave off with credit. A child of eighteen months\r\nstood in the middle of the gravel-walk, very composedly, while the\r\nrifles were popping off; and his elder brothers were busy examining the\r\nshots. Children seem born to their future pursuits, in new countries.\r\nNegro children seem all born riders and drivers. It was an amusement to\r\nsee little children that in England could not hold themselves on a large\r\nhorse, playing pranks with a whole equipage that they were leading to\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of this day we took a long drive in search of buffalo;\r\nthe only herd of those hideous animals now to be seen in Kentucky. None\r\nof the family liked to be left behind, so we filled the barouche and the\r\nphaeton, and Master H., eight years old, in his garden costume, mounted\r\nthe mare, whose foal could not be induced to remain at home, and\r\nfrolicked beside us all the way. We rattled on through lanes, over open\r\nground above a pond, beneath locust groves, and beechen shades, seeing\r\nherds of mules, and the finest of cattle within the verge of the woods.\r\nThe mules are raised for exportation to the fields of Louisiana. Then we\r\nreached the hill-side where eight buffalo were grazing, four of the pure\r\nand four of a mixed breed. The creatures stood looking at us as if they\r\nhad been turned into stone at the sight of us. Their sidelong gaze, as\r\nthey stood motionless beside a stump, or beneath a tree, was horrid. I\r\nnever saw an eye and attitude of which I should be so much afraid. As\r\nthey appeared to have no intention of moving a hair of their tails or\r\nhuge necks while we halted, a little slave, named Oliver, was sent up\r\nthe hill to put them in motion; there being no danger whatever in the\r\noperation. Oliver disappeared, and no result of his exertions was\r\nvisible. When the buffalo and we had mutually stared for another five\r\nminutes, Oliver's master called to him to know what he was about. He\r\nreplied that the buffalo looked too hard at him. At last, however, he\r\nwent near enough to put them in motion; and then they moved all at once,\r\neach seeming more clumsy than the others in its headlong run. I am glad\r\nto have seen buffalo, but there is nothing to be said for their beauty\r\nor grace.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we repaired to the cool grass-plat, to amuse ourselves\r\nwith the pretty sport of trying which should find out the first star. It\r\nwas then ascertained that two gentlemen present were well qualified to\r\nentertain us with stories of horrible western murders,--more fearful\r\nthan any other murders. So we sat till late at night, amidst summer\r\nlightning and the glancing of fire-flies, listening to the most\r\nharrowing and chilling set of tales of human misdeeds and their\r\nretributions, that it ever was my fortune to listen to. The Christmas\r\nfiresides of England yield no impressions of horror like the plain facts\r\nof a life in the wilderness, told under the trees, in a sultry night,\r\nwhile the pale lightning is exploding on the horizon.\r\n\r\nWe had tidings of a camp-meeting to be held at some distance, the next\r\nday. I had never seen a camp-meeting; but the notice was too short, and\r\nthe distance too great, and I missed the chance.\r\n\r\nOne of the slaves of a neighbouring gentleman came and asked his master\r\nwhat he would give him for two bee-holes. \"You are a pretty fellow,\"\r\nsaid his master, \"to ask me to pay for my own trees.\" The negro urged\r\nthat his master would never have found out the bee-holes for himself;\r\nwhich was very true. He was referred to his mistress; and it was finally\r\narranged that three of us English strangers should see the felling of a\r\nbee-tree; a spectacle we had all heard of, but not seen. A large party\r\ndined at this gentleman's house; and, presently after dinner, all set\r\nout in carriages, or on horseback, for the spot in the woods where the\r\nbee-tree stood. It was a shabby black walnut, which seemed scarcely fit\r\ncompany for the noble array of trees around it. It was of so respectable\r\na circumference near the ground, however, and the negroes were making\r\nsuch slow progress into its interior, that it was plain we should have\r\ntime for a drive in the woods before the catastrophe; so my host mounted\r\nthe box of our barouche, and we wound hither and thither under the\r\ntrees, over the rich grass; and, seldom having to stoop to avoid the\r\nbranches, catching bright glimpses of a hundred glades. It was a full\r\nhour before the tree fell. We arrived just when it was chopped into the\r\nmiddle, and some minutes before the event. It is a pretty sight to see\r\nthe top branches of the falling glory quiver, its canopy shake, and its\r\nhuge bulk come crashing down, while everybody runs away at the shout\r\nwhich tells that it is coming. This tree fell on the wrong side, and\r\ndestroyed several yards of fence, snapping the stakes, and setting them\r\nflying in all directions.\r\n\r\nStraw and sulphur were burned in the hollow of the trunk. A few little\r\nstartled bees flew out, and wreaked their vengeance on our host and\r\nmyself; but most of them perished very quietly. I was asked whether I\r\nshould like to look into the cleft; and when I was stepping over the\r\nbristling branches for the purpose, a bough was put into my hand, with\r\ndirections to wave it before me. I returned, stung, but having seen what\r\nI wanted; and then I was told that if I had not waved a bough, I should\r\nhave escaped the bees. Mine was the common fate of persons who follow\r\nunasked advice. Our host capered among the trees, with a bee or two\r\nunder his cravat and hair. It was impossible to help laughing. A stout\r\ngentleman of the party did the same, under the mere idea of bees being\r\nupon him; and, while tossing his head and arms about, he ran up, with a\r\ngreat shock, against his own horse; on which sat a little negro,\r\ngrinning from ear to ear. The result of the whole was,--half a tumbler\r\nglass full of blackened honey, and the high gratification of the\r\nspectators, native and foreign, unharmed and stung.\r\n\r\nSuch is a fair specimen of our life in the West. Contrasts rise up\r\nbefore my mind's eye, as the scenes of my journeying present themselves;\r\ncontrasts in the face of the country, as striking as in the modes of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Salem, in Massachusetts, the friends whose hospitality I\r\nwas enjoying proposed an excursion to Cape Ann, (the northern point of\r\nMassachusetts' bay,) and round the peninsula which constitutes the\r\ntownship of Gloucester. This excursion impressed me strongly, from the\r\npeculiar character of the scenery: but I know not whether it is an\r\nimpression which can be conveyed by description. Whether it be or not, I\r\nwould recommend all strangers to go and visit this peninsula; and, if\r\nconvenient, in fine autumn weather, when the atmosphere lends its best\r\naid to the characteristic charms of the landscape.\r\n\r\nIt was the 19th of October, a foggy morning, when we mounted the\r\ncarry-all,--a carriage which holds four,--and drove merrily out of\r\nSalem, upon a carpet of fallen leaves. I love streets that have trees in\r\nthem; Summer Street in Boston; State Street in Albany; and Chesnut\r\nStreet in Salem. We passed through Beverley, where, as in most of the\r\nsmall New England towns, the population has a character of its own. At\r\nMarblehead, on the bay, near Salem, the people are noisy, restless,\r\nhigh-spirited, and democratic. At Beverley, in the near neighbourhood,\r\nthey are quiet, economical, sober, and whig. Such, at least, is the\r\ntheory: and one fact in this connexion is, that the largest sums in the\r\nBoston savings' banks are from Beverley. We passed over a long\r\nbridge,--a respectable toll-bridge. The Americans are not fond of tolls\r\nof above a certain age,--for fear of monopoly. There is a small bridge,\r\ncalled Spite Bridge, because it spites the Beverley toll, which is much\r\nused in preference. Seven miles further is Manchester;--how unlike the\r\nEnglish Manchester! A mere with pond-lilies! woods with the glorious\r\nmagnolia flourishing in the midst! This is the only place in New England\r\nwhere the magnolia grows. In summer, parties are formed to visit the\r\nwoods; and children make much money as guides and gatherers.\r\nCabinet-making is the great business of the place. We saw logs of\r\nmahogany lying outside the houses; and much furniture in pieces standing\r\nup against the walls, ready to be packed for New Orleans. The furniture\r\nof the southern cities is almost entirely derived from this\r\nneighbourhood. One manufacturer, who makes the furniture here, and sells\r\nit from his warehouse at New Orleans, has an income of 150,000 dollars.\r\nThe inhabitants of Manchester are very prosperous. The houses were all\r\ngood, except, here and there, the abode of a drunkard, known by its\r\nunpainted walls, loose shingles, broken shutters, and decayed door-step,\r\nin striking contrast with the neat white or yellow painted houses of the\r\nneighbours, with their bright windows, and spruce Venetian blinds.\r\n\r\nSeven miles further, stands Gloucester; the road to it winding among\r\nwooded rocks; sometimes close down to the shore; and sometimes\r\noverhanging the rippling waters of Massachusetts Bay. The gay autumn\r\ncopses harmonized well with the grey granite, out of which they seemed\r\nto grow; and with the pearly sea, sinning out from beneath the\r\ndissolving mist.\r\n\r\nWe crossed a little canal which opens into the bay, near Gloucester; and\r\nhastened onto the most interesting ground we had to traverse, stopping\r\nonly a few minutes at Gloucester, to consult a map which indicated\r\nalmost every rock and house in the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe population of the peninsula is homogeneous. There is probably no\r\nindividual beyond Gloucester whose parentage may not be referred to a\r\nparticular set of people, at a particular date in English history. It\r\nhas great wealth of granite and fish. It is composed of granite; and\r\nalmost its only visitors are fish.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular region. If a little orchard plot is seen, here and\r\nthere it seems rescued by some chance from being grown over with\r\ngranite. It was pleasant to see such a hollow, with its apple tree, the\r\nladder reared against it, the basket beneath, and the children picking\r\nup the fallen fruit. The houses look as if they were squeezed in among\r\nthe rocks. The granite rises straight behind a house, encroaches on each\r\nside, and overhangs the roof, leaving space only for a sprinkling of\r\ngrass about the door, for a red shrub or two to wave from a crevice, and\r\na drip of water to flow down among gay weeds. Room for these dwellings\r\nis obtained by blasting the rocks. Formerly, people were frightened at\r\nfragments falling through the roof after a blasting: but now, it has\r\nbecome too common an occurrence to alarm any body. One precaution is\r\nenforced: no one is allowed to keep more than twenty-eight pounds of\r\npowder in one town or village; and the powder-houses may be seen,\r\ninsulated on rocks, and looking something like watch-boxes, at some\r\ndistance from every settlement. The school-houses are also remarkable\r\nbuildings. The school-house may always be known at a glance: a single\r\nsquare room, generally painted white or pale green, and reared on a\r\ngrassy eminence, with a number of small heads to be seen through the\r\nwindows, or little people gathered about the door. There are twenty-one\r\nschool-houses in this township of Gloucester, the population of which is\r\nnine thousand.\r\n\r\nWe dined at Sandy Bay, in a neat little hotel, whose windows bloomed\r\nwith chrysanthemums, nasturtium, and geraniums; and where we feasted on\r\nchowder, an excellent dish when well cooked. It consists of fish, (in\r\nthis instance haddock,) stewed in milk, with potatoes. The parlour table\r\nwas graced with a fair collection of books; as was almost every parlour\r\nI saw, throughout the country. Sandy Bay is a thriving place. It has a\r\npretty, and very conspicuous church, and a breakwater, built by the\r\npeople, at an expense of 40,000 dollars, but now too small for their\r\npurposes. The Atlantic rolls in upon their coast fiercely in winter: and\r\nthe utility of a harbour hereabouts for all vessels, is a sufficient\r\nground for an application to Congress for an appropriation of 100,000\r\ndollars, to make a larger breakwater. If the application has succeeded,\r\nSandy Bay will soon be an important place. While dinner was preparing,\r\nwe went down to the little harbour, and saw the dancing fishing-vessels,\r\nthe ranges and piles of mackarel barrels, and an immense display of the\r\nfish drying. The mackarel fishery begins in June, and continues almost\r\nthrough the year. There are three orders of mackarel, to which the\r\nunfortunate individuals which are detained in their summer excursion\r\nare assigned, according to their plumpness; one dollar per barrel being\r\nthe superiority of price of one over another.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we proceeded on our travels, first visiting Cape Ann, the\r\nextreme north end of Massachusetts Bay. We had the bay before us, and\r\nthe great Atlantic on our left. We ought to have seen Boston; but the\r\nfog had not quite cleared away in the distance. Thatcher's Island was\r\nnear, with its two lighthouses, and a bright, green sea playing about\r\nit. Then we turned and drove northward along the shore, with busy and\r\nmost picturesque quarries to our left. There were tall poles in the\r\nquarries, with stretched ropes, the pulleys by which the blocks of stone\r\nwere raised: there were ox-teams and sleds: there were groups of workmen\r\nin the recesses of the rocks, and beside the teams, and about the little\r\nbays and creeks, where graceful sloops were riding under the lee of tiny\r\nbreakwaters, where the embarkation of the stone for foreign parts goes\r\non. Blocks of granite lay by the road-side, marked, either in reference\r\nto its quality, if for sale; or to its proportion among the materials\r\nwhich are being prepared to order for some great building in New York,\r\nor Mobile, or New Orleans. Some may wonder how granite should be exposed\r\nfor sale in such a district; and who would be likely to buy it. I saw,\r\nthis afternoon, gate-posts, corner-posts, and foundations of common\r\nhouses, of undressed granite; and, also, an entire house, the abode of\r\nthe blacksmith. The friend who sat beside me told me that he hoped to\r\nsee many more such mechanics' dwellings before he dies. Stone becomes\r\ncheaper, and wood dearer, continually; and there is no question which is\r\nthe more desirable material for those who can afford it. With regard to\r\nbeauty merely, I know of no building material to equal granite; dressed\r\nin the city; undressed in the country. We went into a quarry, and saw an\r\nuntold wealth of fissured stone. The workmen contrive to pursue their\r\nbusiness even in the winter. When the snow is on the ground, and the\r\nprocess of drilling is stopped, they remove ordinary pieces out of the\r\nway, and make all clear for their spring labours. They \"turn out\"\r\n250,000 dollars'-worth a-year; and the demand is perpetually on the\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nAlong the north side of the peninsula the road was very pretty. The\r\ngrey, distant coast of New Hampshire bounded the sea view. Groups of\r\nchildren were playing on the sands of a deep cove; and the farmers were\r\ncollecting or spreading their manure of sea-weed and fish-heads. Squam\r\nriver, which forms the peninsula, flowed out into the sea, and the\r\nvillage of Annisquam spread along its bank. We crossed the bridge, close\r\nby the only tide mill I ever saw. It works for six hours, and stops for\r\nsix, while the flow of the tide fills the pond above. The gates are then\r\nshut, and a water-power is obtained till the tide again flows.\r\n\r\nWe saw what we could of Gloucester, on our return to that little town,\r\nbefore sunset. There are some very good houses, newly-built; and the\r\nplace has the air of prosperity that gladdens the eye wherever it turns,\r\nin New England. We ran down to the shore. It is overlooked by a\r\nwindmill, from whose grassy platform we beheld the scene in the singular\r\nlight which here succeeds an autumn sunset. The sky and sea were,\r\nwithout exaggeration, of a deep scarlet: Ten Pound Island sat black upon\r\nthe waters, with its yellow beacon just lighted. Fishing vessels lay\r\nstill, every rope being reflected in the red mirror; and a boat, in\r\nwhich a boy was sculling across the harbour, was the only moving object.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, a clergyman and his wife called; and then a long succession\r\nof the hospitable inhabitants of Gloucester came to bid us welcome: from\r\nwhich it appeared that small articles of intelligence circulate as\r\nrapidly here as in other country-places. In another respect, Gloucester\r\nresembled all the villages and small towns I passed through: in the\r\npretty attention of presenting flowers. In some of the larger cities,\r\nbouquets of rich and rare flowers were sent to me, however severe might\r\nhave been the frost, or however dreary the season. In the smallest\r\nvillages, I had offerings, quite as welcome, in bunches of flowers from\r\nthe woods and meadows. Many of these last were new to me, and as gladly\r\nreceived as the luscious hyacinths which greeted me every morning at\r\nCharleston. At Lenox, in Massachusetts, where I spent one night, my\r\ntable was covered with meadow-flowers, and with fine specimens of\r\nJack-in-the-pulpit, and the moccassin-flower, or lady's slipper: and at\r\nGloucester, when I returned from my early visit to the beach, where I\r\nhad been to see the fishermen go out, I found a gorgeous bouquet of\r\nautumn flowers; dahlias more various and rich than could have been\r\nsupposed to grow in such a region.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Salem, we diverged a little from our road, near\r\nManchester, to see a farm, whose situation would make an envious person\r\nmiserable. The house lies under the shelter of a wooded hill, and enjoys\r\na glorious view of Massachusetts Bay. The property lies between two\r\nbays, and has a fine fishing-station off the point. The fields look\r\nfertile, and a wide range of pasturage skirts the bay. A woman and\r\nchildren were busy in the orchard, with a cart and barrels, taking in a\r\nfine crop of apples; and we could only hope that they were sensible of\r\ntheir privilege in living in such a place. These are the region,\r\nteeming with the virtues of the Pilgrims, and as yet uninfected by the\r\nmercenary and political cowardice of the cities, where the most\r\ngladdening aspects of human life are to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newly-settled districts of the southern States are as unlike as\r\npossible to all this. They are extreme opposite cases. If human life\r\npresents its fairest aspects in the retired townships of New\r\nEngland,--some of its very worst, perhaps, are seen in the raw\r\nsettlements of Alabama and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWhen we drew near to Columbus, Georgia, we were struck with amazement at\r\nthe stories that were told, and the anecdotes that were dropped, in the\r\nstage, about recent attempts on human life in the neighbourhood; and at\r\nthe number of incidents of the same kind which were the news of the day\r\nalong the road. Our driver from Macon had been shot at, in attempting to\r\ncarry off a young lady. A gentleman, boarding in the hotel at Columbus,\r\nwas shot in the back, in the street, and laid by for months. No inquiry\r\nwas made, or nothing came of it. The then present governor of the State\r\nof Mississippi had recently stood over two combatants, pistol in hand,\r\nto see fair play. This _was_ stated as a remarkable fact. The landlord\r\nof the house where we stopped to breakfast on the day we were to reach\r\nColumbus, April 9th, 1835, was, besides keeping a house of\r\nentertainment, a captain of militia, and a member of the legislature of\r\nGeorgia. He was talking over with his guests a late case of homicide in\r\na feud between the Myers and Macklimore families. He declared that he\r\nwould have laws like those of the Medes and Persians against homicide;\r\nand, in the same breath, said that if he were a Myers, he would shoot\r\nMr. Macklimore and all his sons.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Columbus before sunset, and determined to stay a day to\r\nsee how the place had got on since Captain Hall saw it cut out of the\r\nwoods, ten years before. During the evening, I could do nothing but\r\nwatch the Indians from my window. The place swarmed with them; a few\r\nChoctaws, and the rest Creeks. A sad havoc has taken place among them\r\nsince; and this neighbourhood has been made the scene of a short but\r\nfierce war. But all looked fair and friendly when we were there. Groups\r\nof Indians were crouching about the entries of the stores, or looking in\r\nat the windows. The squaws went by, walking one behind another, with\r\ntheir hair, growing low on the forehead, loose, or tied at the back of\r\nthe head, forming a fine contrast with the young lady who had presided\r\nat our breakfast-table at five that morning, with her long hair braided\r\nand adorned with brilliant combs, while her fingers shone in pearl and\r\ngold rings. These squaws carried large Indian baskets on their backs,\r\nand shuffled along, bare-footed, while their lords paced before them,\r\nwell mounted; or, if walking, gay with blue and red clothing and\r\nembroidered leggings, with tufts of hair at the knees, while pouches and\r\nwhite fringes dangled about them. They looked like grave merry-andrews;\r\nor, more still, like solemn fanatical harvest men going out for largess.\r\nBy eight o'clock they had all disappeared; but the streets were full of\r\nthem again the next morning.\r\n\r\nOur hostess was civil, and made no difficulty about giving us a late\r\nbreakfast by ourselves, in consideration of our fatigues. Before one\r\no'clock we dined, in company with seventy-five persons, at one long\r\ntable. The provisions were good, but ill-cooked; and the knives so blunt\r\nthat it was a mystery to me how the rest of the company obtained so\r\nquick a succession of mouthfuls as they did.\r\n\r\nThe Chattahoochee, on whose banks Columbus stands, is unlike any river\r\nI saw in the United States, unless it be some parts of the Susquehanna.\r\nIts rapids, overhung by beech and pine woods, keep up a perpetual\r\nmelody, grateful alike to the ear of the white and the red man. It is\r\nbroad and full, whirling over and around the rocks with which it is\r\nstudded, and under the frail wooden foot-bridge which spans a portion of\r\nits width, between the shore and a pile of rocks in the middle of the\r\nchannel. On this foot-bridge I stood, and saw a fish caught in a net\r\nlaid among the eddies. A dark fisherman stood on each little promontory;\r\nand a group was assembled about some canoes in a creek on the opposite\r\nAlabama shore, where the steepness of the hills seemed scarcely to allow\r\na foothold between the rushing water and the ascent. The river is\r\nspanned by a long covered bridge, which we crossed the same night on our\r\nway into Alabama.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal streets in Columbus, with many smaller,\r\nbranching out into the forest. Some pretty bits of greensward are left,\r\nhere and there, with a church, or a detached house upon\r\neach--village-like. There are some good houses, five hotels, and a\r\npopulation of above 2,000,--as nearly as I could make out among the\r\ndifferent accounts of the accession of inhabitants since the census. The\r\nstores looked creditably stocked; and a great many gentlemanly men were\r\nto be seen in the streets. It bears the appearance of being a thriving,\r\nspacious, handsome village, well worth stopping to see.\r\n\r\nWe left it, at seven in the evening, by the long bridge, at the other\r\nend of which we stopped for the driver to hold a parley, about a parcel,\r\nwith a woman, who spoke almost altogether in oaths. A gentleman in the\r\nstage remarked, that we must have got quite to the end of the world.\r\nThe roads were as bad as roads could be; and we rolled from side to side\r\nso incessantly, as to obviate all chance of sleeping. The passengers\r\nwere very patient during the hours of darkness; but, after daylight,\r\nthey seemed to think they had been long enough employed in shifting\r\ntheir weight to keep the coach on its four wheels. \"I say, driver,\"\r\ncried one, \"you won't upset us, now daylight is come?\" \"Driver,\" shouted\r\nanother, \"keep this side up.\" \"Gentlemen,\" replied the driver, \"I shall\r\nmind nothing you say till the ladies begin to complain.\" A reply equally\r\npolitic and gallant.\r\n\r\nAt half past five, we stopped to breakfast at a log dwelling, composed\r\nof two rooms, with an open passage between. We asked for water and\r\ntowel. There was neither basin nor towel; but a shallow tin dish of\r\nwater was served up in the open passage where all our fellow-travellers\r\nwere standing. We asked leave to carry our dish into the right-hand\r\nroom. The family were not all dressed. Into the left-hand room. A lady\r\nlodged there!\r\n\r\nWe travelled till sunset through the Creek Territory, the roads\r\ncontinuing to be extremely bad. The woods were superb in their spring\r\nbeauty. The thickets were in full leaf; and the ground was gay with\r\nviolets, may-apple, buck-eye, blue lupin, iris, and crow-poison. The\r\nlast is like the white lily, growing close to the ground. Its root,\r\nboiled, mixed with corn, and thrown out into the fields, poisons crows.\r\nIf eaten by cattle, it injures but does not destroy them. The sour-wood\r\nis a beautiful shrub. To-day it looked like a splendid white fuchsia,\r\nwith tassels of black butterflies hanging from the extremities of the\r\ntwigs. But the grandest flower of all, perhaps the most exquisite I ever\r\nbeheld, is the honeysuckle of the southern woods. It bears little\r\nresemblance to the ragged flower which has the same name elsewhere. It\r\nis a globe of blossoms, larger than my hand, growing firmly at the end\r\nof an upright stalk, with the richest and most harmonious colouring, the\r\nmost delicate long anthers, and the flowers exquisitely grouped among\r\nthe leaves. It is the queen of flowers. I generally contrived, in my\r\njourneys through the southern States, to have a bunch of honeysuckles in\r\nthe stage before my eyes; and they seemed to be visible wherever I\r\nturned, springing from the roots of the forest trees, or dangling from\r\ntheir topmost boughs, or mixing in with the various greens of the\r\nthickets.\r\n\r\nWe saw to-day, the common sight of companies of slaves travelling\r\nwestwards; and the very uncommon one of a party returning into South\r\nCarolina. When we overtook such a company proceeding westwards, and\r\nasked where they were going, the answer commonly given by the slaves\r\nwas, \"Into Yellibama.\"--Sometimes these poor creatures were encamped\r\nunder the care of the slave-trader, on the banks of a clear stream, to\r\nspend a day in washing their clothes. Sometimes they were loitering\r\nalong the road; the old folks and infants mounted on the top of a\r\nwagon-load of luggage; the able-bodied, on foot, perhaps silent, perhaps\r\nlaughing; the prettier of the girls, perhaps with a flower in the hair,\r\nand a lover's arm around her shoulder. There were wide differences in\r\nthe air and gait of these people. It is usual to call the most depressed\r\nof them brutish in appearance. In some sense they are so; but I never\r\nsaw in any brute an expression of countenance so low, so lost, as in the\r\nmost degraded class of negroes. There is some life and intelligence in\r\nthe countenance of every animal; even in that of \"the silly sheep,\"\r\nnothing so dead as the vacant, unheeding look of the depressed slave is\r\nto be seen. To-day, there was a spectacle by the roadside which showed\r\nthat this has nothing to do with negro nature; though no such proof is\r\nneeded by those who have seen negroes in favourable circumstances, and\r\nknow how pleasant an aspect those grotesque features may wear. To-day we\r\npassed, in the Creek Territory, an establishment of Indians who held\r\nslaves. Negroes are anxious to be sold to Indians, who give them\r\nmoderate work, and accommodations as good as their own. Those seen\r\nto-day among the Indians, were sleek, intelligent, and cheerful-looking,\r\nlike the most favoured house-slaves, or free servants of colour, where\r\nthe prejudice is least strong.\r\n\r\nWe were on the look-out for Indians, all the way through this Creek\r\nTerritory. Some on horseback gave us a grave glance as we passed. Some\r\nindividuals were to be seen in the shadow of the forest, leaning against\r\na tree or a fence. One lay asleep by the roadside, overcome with\r\n\"whiskey too much,\" as they style intoxication. They are so intent on\r\nhaving their full bargain of whiskey, that they turn their bottle upside\r\ndown, when it has been filled to the cork, to have the hollow at the\r\nbottom filled. The piazza at the post-office was full of solemn Indians.\r\nMiserable-looking squaws were about the dwellings, with their naked\r\nchildren, who were gobbling up their supper of hominy from a wooden\r\nbowl.\r\n\r\nWe left the Creek Territory just as the full moon rose, and hoped to\r\nreach Montgomery by two hours before midnight. We presently began to\r\nascend a long hill; and the gentlemen passengers got out, according to\r\ncustom, to walk up the rising ground. In two minutes, the driver\r\nstopped, and came to tell us ladies that he was sorry to trouble us to\r\nget out; but that an emigrant's wagon had blocked up the ford of a creek\r\nwhich we had to cross; and he feared we might be wetted if we remained\r\nin the stage while he took it through a deeper part. A gentleman was\r\nwaiting, he said, to hand us over the log which was to be our bridge.\r\nThis gentleman, I believe, was the emigrant himself. I made for what\r\nseemed to me the end of the log; but was deceived by the treacherous\r\nmoonlight, which made wood, ground, and water, look all one colour. I\r\nplunged up to the waist into the creek; and, when I was out again, could\r\nhardly keep upon the log for laughing. There was time, before we\r\novertook the rest of the party, to provide against my taking cold; and\r\nthere remained only the ridiculous image of my deliberate walk into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed a common circumstance that an emigrant's wagon\r\nwas left in a creek. The \"camping out\" is usually done in a sheltered,\r\ndry spot in the woods, not far from some little stream, where the kettle\r\nmay be filled, and where the dusty children may be washed. Sleepy as I\r\nmight be, in our night journeys, I was ever awake to this picture, and\r\nnever tired of contemplating it. A dun haze would first appear through\r\nthe darkness; and then gleams of light across the road. Then the whole\r\nscene opened. If earlier than ten at night, the fire would be blazing,\r\nthe pot boiling, the shadowy horses behind, at rest, the groups fixed in\r\ntheir attitudes to gaze at us, whether they were stretching their\r\nsailcloth on poles to windward, or drawing up the carts in line, or\r\ngathering sticks, or cooking. While watching us, they little thought\r\nwhat a picture they themselves made. If after midnight, the huge fire\r\nwas flickering and smouldering; figures were seen crouching under the\r\nsailcloth, or a head or two was lifted up in the wagon. A solitary\r\nfigure was seen in relief against the fire; the watch, standing to keep\r\nhimself awake; or, if greeted by our driver, thrusting a pine slip into\r\nthe fire, and approaching with his blazing torch to ask or to give\r\ninformation. In the morning, the places where such encampments have\r\nbeen cannot be mistaken. There is a clear, trodden space, strewed with\r\nchips and refuse food, with the bare poles which had supported the\r\nsailcloth, standing in the midst, and a scorched spot where the fire had\r\nbeen kindled. Others, besides emigrants, camp out in the woods. Farmers,\r\non their way to a distant market, find it cheaper to bring food, and\r\ntrust otherwise to the hospitality of dame Nature, than to put up at\r\nhotels. Between the one and the other, we were amply treated with the\r\nuntiring spectacle.\r\n\r\nWe had bespoken accommodations for the night at the hotel at Montgomery,\r\nby a friend who had preceded us. On our arrival at past eleven o'clock,\r\nwe found we were expected; but no one would have guessed it. In my\r\nchamber, there was neither water, nor sheets, nor anything that afforded\r\na prospect of my getting to rest, wet as my clothes were. We were\r\nhungry, and tired, and cold; and there was no one to help us but a\r\nslave, who set about her work as slaves do. We ate some biscuits that we\r\nhad with us, and gave orders, and made requests with so much success as\r\nto have the room in tolerable order by an hour after midnight. When I\r\nawoke in the morning, the first thing I saw was, that two mice were\r\nrunning after one another round my trunk, and that the floor of the room\r\nseemed to contain the dust of a twelvemonth. The breakfast was to atone\r\nfor all. The hostess and another lady, three children, and an array of\r\nslaves, placed themselves so as to see us eat our breakfast; but it\r\nseemed to me that the contents of the table were more wonderful to look\r\nat than ourselves. Besides the tea and coffee, there were corn bread,\r\nbuns, buck-wheat cakes, broiled chicken, bacon, eggs, rice, hominy,\r\nfish, fresh and pickled, and beef-steak. The hostess strove to make us\r\nfeel at home, and recommended her plentiful meal by her hearty welcome\r\nto it. She was anxious to explain that her house was soon to be in\r\nbetter order. Her husband was going to Mobile to buy furniture; and,\r\njust now, all was in confusion, from her head slave having swallowed a\r\nfish bone, and being unable to look after the affairs of the house. When\r\nour friends came to carry us to their plantation, she sent in\r\nrefreshments, and made herself one of the party, in all heartiness.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, and we went to the Methodist church, hoping to hear the\r\nregular pastor, who is a highly-esteemed preacher. But a stranger was in\r\nthe pulpit, who gave us an extraordinary piece of doctrine, propounded\r\nwith all possible vehemence. His text was the passage about the tower of\r\nSiloam; and his doctrine was that great sinners would somehow die a\r\nviolent death. Perhaps this might be thought a useful proposition in a\r\ntown where life is held so cheap as in Montgomery; but we could not\r\nexactly understand how it was derived from the text. The place was\r\nintensely light and hot, there being no blinds to the windows, on each\r\nside of the pulpit: and the quietness of the children was not to be\r\nboasted of.\r\n\r\nOn the way to our friends' plantation, we passed a party of negroes,\r\nenjoying their Sunday drive. They never appear better than on such\r\noccasions, as they all ride and drive well, and are very gallant to\r\ntheir ladies. We passed a small prairie, the first we had seen; and very\r\nserene and pretty it looked, after the forest. It was green and\r\nundulating, with a fringe of trees.\r\n\r\nOur friends, now residing seven miles from Montgomery, were from South\r\nCarolina; and the lady, at least, does not relish living in Alabama. It\r\nwas delightful to me to be a guest in such an abode as theirs. They were\r\nabout to build a good house: meantime, they were in one which I liked\r\nexceedingly: a log-house, with the usual open passage in the middle.\r\nRoses and honeysuckles, to which humming-birds resort, grew before the\r\ndoor. Abundance of books, and handsome furniture and plate, were within\r\nthe house, while daylight was to be seen through its walls. In my well\r\nfurnished chamber, I could see the stars through the chinks between the\r\nlogs. During the summer, I should be sorry to change this primitive kind\r\nof abode for a better.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to procure the necessaries and comforts of life.\r\nMost articles of food are provided on the plantation. Wine and groceries\r\nare obtained from Mobile or New Orleans; and clothing and furniture from\r\nthe north. Tea is twenty shillings English per lb.; brown sugar,\r\nthreepence-halfpenny; white sugar, sixpence-halfpenny. A gentleman's\r\nfamily, where there are children to be educated, cannot live for less\r\nthan from seven hundred pounds to one thousand pounds per annum. The\r\nsons take land and buy slaves very early; and the daughters marry almost\r\nin childhood; so that education is less thought of, and sooner ended,\r\nthan in almost any part of the world. The pioneers of civilisation, as\r\nthe settlers in these new districts may be regarded, care for other\r\nthings more than for education; or they would not come. They are, from\r\nwhatever motive, money-getters; and few but money-getting qualifications\r\nare to be looked for in them. It was partly amusing, and partly sad, to\r\nobserve the young people of these regions; some, fit for a better mode\r\nof life, discontented; some youths pedantic, some maidens romantic, to a\r\ndegree which makes the stranger almost doubt the reality of the scenes\r\nand personages before his eyes. The few better educated who come to get\r\nmoney, see the absurdity, and feel the wearisomeness of this kind of\r\nliterary cultivation; but the being in such society is the tax they\r\nmust pay for making haste to be rich.\r\n\r\nI heard in Montgomery of a wealthy old planter in the neighbourhood, who\r\nhas amassed millions of dollars, while his children can scarcely write\r\ntheir names. Becoming aware of their deficiencies, as the place began to\r\nbe peopled from the eastward, he sent a son of sixteen to school, and a\r\nyounger one to college; but they proved \"such gawks,\" that they were\r\nunable to learn, or even to remain in the society of others who were\r\nlearning; and their old father has bought land in Missouri, whither he\r\nwas about to take his children, to remove them from the contempt of\r\ntheir neighbours. They are doomed to the lowest office of social beings;\r\nto be the mechanical, unintelligent pioneers of man in the wilderness.\r\nSurely such a warning as this should strike awe into the whole region,\r\nlest they should also perish to all the best purposes of life, by\r\ngetting to consider money, not as a means, but an end.\r\n\r\nI suppose there must be such pioneers; but the result is a society which\r\nit is a punishment to its best members to live in. There is pedantry in\r\nthose who read; prejudice in those who do not; coxcombry among the young\r\ngentlemen; bad manners among the young ladies; and an absence of all\r\nreference to the higher, the real objects of life. When to all this is\r\nadded that tremendous curse, the possession of irresponsible power,\r\n(over slaves,) it is easy to see how character must become, in such\r\nregions, what it was described to me on the spot, \"composed of the\r\nchivalric elements, badly combined:\" and the wise will feel that, though\r\na man _may_ save his soul anywhere, it is better to live on bread and\r\nwater where existence is most idealized, than to grow suddenly rich in\r\nthe gorgeous regions where mind is corrupted or starved amidst the\r\nluxuriance of nature. The hard-working settler of the north-west, who\r\nhews his way into independence with his own hands, is, or may be, exempt\r\nfrom the curse of this mental corruption or starvation; but it falls\r\ninevitably and heavily upon those who fatten upon the bounty of Nature,\r\nin the society of money-getters like themselves, and through the labours\r\nof degraded fellow-men, whom they hold in their injurious power.\r\n\r\nWe saw several plantations while we were in this neighbourhood. Nothing\r\ncan be richer than the soil of one to which we went, to take a lesson in\r\ncotton-growing. It will never want more than to have the cotton seed\r\nreturned to it. We saw the plough, which is very shallow. Two throw up a\r\nridge, which is wrought by hand into little mounds. After these are\r\ndrilled, the seed is put in by hand. This plantation consists of nine\r\nhundred and fifty acres, and is flourishing in every way. The air is\r\nhealthy, as the situation is high prairie land. The water is generally\r\ngood; but, after rain, so impregnated with lime, as to be disagreeable\r\nto the smell and taste. Another grievance is, a weed which grows on the\r\nprairie, which the cows like in summer, but which makes the milk so\r\ndisagreeable, that cream, half-an-inch thick, is thrown to the pigs.\r\nThey only can estimate this evil who know what the refreshment of milk\r\nis in hot climates. Another grievance is, that no trees can be allowed\r\nto grow near the house, for fear of the mosquitoes. Everything else is\r\ndone for coolness; there are wide piazzas on both sides of the house;\r\nthe rooms are lofty, and amply provided with green blinds; but all this\r\ndoes not compensate to the eye for the want of the shade of trees. The\r\nbareness of the villages of the south is very striking to the eye of a\r\nstranger, as he approaches them. They lie scorching and glaring on the\r\nrising grounds, or on the plain, hazy with the heat, while the forest,\r\nwith its myriads of trees, its depth of shade, is on the horizon. But\r\nthe plague of mosquitoes is a sufficient warrant for any sacrifice of\r\nthe pleasures of the eye; for they allow but little enjoyment of\r\nanything in their presence.\r\n\r\nOn this, and many other estates that we saw, the ladies make it their\r\nbusiness to cut out all the clothes for the negroes. Many a fair pair of\r\nhands have I seen dyed with blue, and bearing the marks of the large\r\nscissars. The slave women cannot be taught, it is said, to cut out even\r\ntheir scanty and unshapely garments economically. Nothing can be more\r\nhideous than their working costume. There would be nothing to lose on\r\nthe score of beauty, and probably much gained, if they could be\r\npermitted to clothe themselves. But it is universally said that they\r\ncannot learn. A few ladies keep a woman for this purpose, very naturally\r\ndisliking the coarse employment.\r\n\r\nWe visited the negro quarter; a part of the estate which filled me with\r\ndisgust, wherever I went. It is something between a haunt of monkeys and\r\na dwelling-place of human beings. The natural good taste, so remarkable\r\nin free negroes, is here extinguished. Their small, dingy, untidy\r\nhouses, their cribs, the children crouching round the fire, the animal\r\ndeportment of the grown-up, the brutish chagrins and enjoyments of the\r\nold, were all loathsome. There was some relief in seeing the children\r\nplaying in the sun, and sometimes fowls clucking and strutting round the\r\nhouses; but otherwise, a walk through a lunatic asylum is far less\r\npainful than a visit to the slave quarter of an estate. The children are\r\nleft, during working hours, in the charge of a woman; and they are\r\nbright, and brisk, and merry enough, for the season, however slow and\r\nstupid they may be destined to become.\r\n\r\nMy next visit was to a school--the Franklin Institute, in Montgomery,\r\nestablished by a gentleman who has bestowed unwearied pains on its\r\norganization, and to whose care it does great credit. On our approach,\r\nwe saw five horses walking about the enclosure, and five saddles hung\r\nover the fence: a true sign that some of the pupils came from a\r\ndistance. The school was hung with prints; there was a collection of\r\nshells; many books and maps; and some philosophical apparatus. The boys,\r\nand a few girls, were steadily employed over their books and mapping;\r\nand nothing could exceed the order and neatness of the place. If the\r\nevent corresponds with the appearance, the proprietor must be one of the\r\nmost useful citizens the place has yet been honoured with.\r\n\r\nI spent some days at a plantation a few miles from Montgomery, and heard\r\nthere of an old lady who treats her slaves in a way very unusual, but\r\nquite safe, as far as appears. She gives them knowledge, which is\r\nagainst the law; but the law leaves her in peace and quiet. She also\r\ncommits to them the entire management of the estate, requiring only that\r\nthey should make her comfortable, and letting them take the rest. There\r\nis an obligation by law to keep an overseer; to obviate insurrection.\r\nHow she manages about this, I omitted to inquire: but all goes on well;\r\nthe cultivation of the estate is creditable, and all parties are\r\ncontented. This is only a temporary ease and contentment. The old lady\r\nmust die; and her slaves will either be sold to a new owner, whose\r\ntemper will be an accident; or, if freed, must leave the State: but the\r\nstory is satisfactory in as far as it gives evidence of the\r\ntrust-worthiness of the negroes.\r\n\r\nOur drives about the plantation and neighbouring country were delicious.\r\nThe inundations from the rivers are remarkable; a perfect Eden appears\r\nwhen they subside. At the landing place of this plantation, I saw a\r\nboard nailed near the top of a lofty tree, and asked what it could be\r\nfor. It was the high-water mark. The river, the Alabama, was now upwards\r\nof twenty feet higher than usual; and logs, corn-stalks, and green\r\nboughs were being carried down its rapid current, as often as we went to\r\nthe shore. There were evidences of its having laid even houses under\r\nwater; but, on its subsiding, it would be found to have left a deposit\r\nof two inches and a half of fine new soil on the fields on either side\r\nof its channel. I never stood on the banks of the southern rivers\r\nwithout being reminded of Daniell's Views in India and Ceylon: the water\r\nlevel, shadowy and still, and the thickets actually springing out of it,\r\nwith dark-green recesses, with the relief of a slender white stem, or\r\ndangling creeper here and there. Some creepers rise like a ladder,\r\nstraight from the water to a bough one hundred and twenty feet high. As\r\nfor the softness of the evening light on the water, it is indescribable.\r\nIt is as if the atmosphere were purified from all mortal breathings, it\r\nis so bright, and yet not dazzling; there is such a profusion of\r\nverdure.\r\n\r\nThere were black women ploughing in the field, with their ugly, scanty,\r\ndingy dresses, their walloping gait, and vacant countenance. There were\r\nscarlet and blue birds flitting over the dark fallows. There was\r\npersimon sprouting in the woods, and the young corn-plants in the field,\r\nwith a handful of cotton-seed laid round each sprout. There was a view\r\nfrom a bluff which fully equalled all my expectations of what the\r\nscenery of the southern States would be; yet, tropical as it was in many\r\nrespects, it reminded me strongly of the view from Richmond Hill. We\r\nwere standing on the verge of a precipice, of a height which I dare not\r\nspecify. A deep fissure to our right was spanned by a log which it made\r\none shudder to think of crossing. Behind us lay a cotton-field of 7,000\r\nacres within one fence. All this, and the young aloes, and wild vines,\r\nwere little enough like Richmond; and so was the faint blue line of\r\nhills on the horizon; but it was the intervening plain, through which\r\nthe river ran, and on which an infinite variety of noble trees grew, as\r\nit appeared, to an interminable distance. Here their tops seemed woven\r\ninto compactness; there they were so sprinkled as to display the majesty\r\nand grace of their forms. I looked upon this as a glorification of the\r\nRichmond view.\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of April. In the kitchen garden the peas were\r\nripening, and the strawberries turning red, though the spring of 1835\r\nwas very backward. We had salads, young asparagus, and radishes.\r\n\r\nThe following may be considered a pretty fair account of the provision\r\nfor a planter's table, at this season; and, except with regard to\r\nvegetables, I believe it does not vary much throughout the year.\r\nBreakfast at seven; hot wheat bread, generally sour; corn bread,\r\nbiscuits, waffles, hominy, dozens of eggs, broiled ham, beef-steak or\r\nbroiled fowl, tea and coffee. Lunch at eleven; cake and wine, or\r\nliqueur. Dinner at two; now and then soup (not good,) always roast\r\nturkey and ham; a boiled fowl here, a tongue there; a small piece of\r\nnondescript meat, which generally turns out to be pork disguised;\r\nhominy, rice, hot corn-bread, sweet potatoes; potatoes mashed with\r\nspice, very hot; salad and radishes, and an extraordinary variety of\r\npickles. Of these, you are asked to eat everything with everything else.\r\nIf you have turkey and ham on your plate, you are requested to add\r\ntongue, pork, hominy, and pickles. Then succeed pies of apple, squash,\r\nand pumpkin; custard, and a variety of preserves as extraordinary as the\r\npreceding pickles: pine-apple, peach, limes, ginger, guava jelly,\r\ncocoa-nut, and every sort of plums. These are almost all from the\r\nWest-Indies. Dispersed about the table are shell almonds, raisins,\r\nhickory, and other nuts; and, to crown the whole, large blocks of\r\nice-cream. Champagne is abundant, and cider frequent. Ale and porter may\r\nnow and then be seen; but claret is the most common drink. During dinner\r\na slave stands at a corner of the table, keeping off the flies by waving\r\na large bunch of peacock's feathers fastened into a handle,--an ampler\r\nfan than those of our grandmothers.\r\n\r\nSupper takes place at six, or seven. Sometimes the family sits round the\r\ntable; but more commonly the tray is handed round, with plates which\r\nmust be held in the lap. Then follow tea and coffee, waffles, biscuits,\r\nsliced ham or hung-beef, and sweet cake. Last of all, is the offer of\r\ncake and wine at nine or ten.\r\n\r\nThe profits of cotton-growing, when I was in Alabama, were thirty-five\r\nper cent. One planter whom I knew had bought fifteen thousand dollars'\r\nworth of land within two years, which he could then have sold for\r\nsixty-five thousand dollars. He expected to make, that season, fifty or\r\nsixty thousand dollars of his growing crop. It is certainly the place to\r\nbecome rich in; but the state of society is fearful. One of my hosts, a\r\nman of great good-nature, as he shows in the treatment of his slaves,\r\nand in his family relations, had been stabbed in the back in the\r\nreading-room of the town, two years before, and no prosecution was\r\ninstituted. Another of my hosts carried loaded pistols for a fortnight,\r\njust before I arrived, knowing that he was lain in wait for by persons\r\nagainst whose illegal practices he had given information to a\r\nmagistrate, whose carriage was therefore broken in pieces, and thrown\r\ninto the river. A lawyer with whom we were in company one afternoon, was\r\nsent for to take the deposition of a dying man who had been sitting with\r\nhis family in the shade, when he received three balls in the back from\r\nthree men who took aim at him from behind trees. The tales of\r\njail-breaking and rescue were numberless; and a lady of Montgomery told\r\nme that she had lived there four years, during which time no day, she\r\nbelieved, had passed without some one's life having been attempted,\r\neither by duelling or assassination. It will be understood that I\r\ndescribe this region as presenting an extreme case of the material\r\nadvantages and moral evils of a new settlement, under the institution of\r\nslavery. The most prominent relief is the hospitality,--that virtue of\r\nyoung society. It is so remarkable, and to the stranger so grateful,\r\nthat there is danger of its blinding him to the real state of affairs.\r\nIn the drawing-room, the piazza, the barouche, all is so gay and\r\nfriendly, there is such a prevailing hilarity and kindness, that it\r\nseems positively ungrateful and unjust to pronounce, even in one's own\r\nheart, that all this way of life is full of wrong and peril. Yet it is\r\nimpossible to sit down to reflect, with every order of human beings\r\nfilling an equal space before one's mental eye, without being struck to\r\nthe soul with the conviction that the state of society, and no less of\r\nindividual families, is false and hollow, whether their members are\r\naware of it or not; that they forget that they must be just before they\r\ncan be generous. The severity of this truth is much softened to\r\nsympathetic persons on the spot; but it returns with awful force when\r\nthey look back upon it from afar.\r\n\r\nIn the slave quarter of a plantation hereabouts I saw a poor wretch who\r\nhad run away three times, and been re-captured. The last time he was\r\nfound in the woods, with both legs frost-bitten above the knees, so as\r\nto render amputation necessary. I passed by when he was sitting on the\r\ndoor-step of his hut, and longed to see him breathe his last. But he is\r\na young man, likely to drag out his helpless and hopeless existence for\r\nmany a dreary year. I dread to tell the rest; but such things must be\r\ntold sometimes, to show to what a pass of fiendish cruelty the human\r\nspirit may be brought by merely witnessing the exercise of irresponsible\r\npower over the defenceless. I give the very words of the speaker,\r\npremising that she is not American by birth or education, nor yet\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe master and mistress of this poor slave, with their children, had\r\nalways treated him and his fellow-slaves very kindly. He made no\r\ncomplaint of them. It was not from their cruelty that he attempted to\r\nescape. His running away was therefore a mystery to the person to whom I\r\nhave alluded. She recapitulated all the clothes that had been given to\r\nhim; and all the indulgences, and forgivenesses for his ingratitude in\r\nrunning away from such a master, with which he had been blessed. She\r\ntold me that she had advised his master and mistress to refuse him\r\nclothes, when he had torn his old ones with trying to make his way\r\nthrough the woods; but his master had been too kind, and had again\r\ncovered his nakedness. She turned round upon me, and asked what could\r\nmake the ungrateful wretch run away a third time from such a master?\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to be free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free! from such a master!\"\r\n\r\n\"From any master.\"\r\n\r\n\"The villain! I went to him when he had had his legs cut off, and I said\r\nto him, it serves you right....\"\r\n\r\n\"What! when you knew he could not run away any more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that I did; I said to him, you wretch! but for your master's sake\r\nI am glad it has happened to you. You deserve it, that you do. If I were\r\nyour master I would let you die; I'd give you no help nor nursing. It\r\nserves you right; it is just what you deserve. It's fit that it should\r\nhappen to you ...!\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not--you dared not so insult the miserable creature!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, who knows,\" replied she, \"but that the Lord may bless a word of\r\ngrace in season!\"\r\n\r\nSome readers may conceive this to be a freak of idiotcy. It was not so.\r\nThis person is shrewd and sensible in matters where rights and duties\r\nare not in question. Of these she is, as it appears, profoundly\r\nignorant; in a state of superinduced darkness; but her character is that\r\nof a clever, and, with some, a profoundly religious woman. Happily, she\r\nhas no slaves of her own: at least, no black ones.\r\n\r\nI saw this day, driving a wagon, a man who is a schoolmaster, lawyer,\r\nalmanack-maker, speculator in old iron, and dealer in eggs, in addition\r\nto a few other occupations. His must be a very active existence.\r\n\r\nThis little history of a portion of my southern journey may give an idea\r\nof what life is in the wilder districts of the south. I will offer but\r\none more sketch, and that will exemplify life in the wilder districts of\r\nthe north. The picture of my travels in and around Michigan will convey\r\nthe real state of things there, at present.\r\n\r\nOur travelling party consisted of Mr. and Mrs. L., the before-mentioned\r\nCharley, his father and mother, and myself. We were prepared to see\r\neverything to advantage; for there was strong friendship among us all;\r\nand a very unusual agreement of opinion on subjects which education,\r\ntemperament, or the circumstances of the time, made most interesting to\r\nus. The great ornament of the party--our prince of Denmark--was Charley;\r\na boy of uncommon beauty and promise, and fully worthy of the character\r\ngiven him by one of our drivers, with whom the boy had ingratiated\r\nhimself by his chatter on the box;--\"An eternal smart boy, and the\r\ngreatest hand at talk I ever came across.\"\r\n\r\nWe landed at Detroit, from Lake Erie, at seven o'clock in the morning of\r\nthe 13th of June, 1836. We reached the American just in time for\r\nbreakfast. At that long table, I had the pleasure of seeing the\r\nhealthiest set of faces that I had beheld since I left England. The\r\nbreakfast was excellent, and we were served with much consideration; but\r\nthe place was so full, and the accommodations of Detroit are so\r\ninsufficient for the influx of people who are betaking themselves\r\nthither, that strangers must patiently put up with much delay and\r\ninconvenience till new houses of entertainment are opened. We had to\r\nwait till near one o'clock before any of us could have a room in which\r\nto dress; but I had many letters to write, and could wait; and before I\r\nhad done, Charley came with his shining face and clean collar, to show\r\nme that accommodation had been provided. In the afternoon, we saw what\r\nwe could of the place, and walked by the side of the full and tranquil\r\nriver St. Clair. The streets of the town are wide and airy; but the\r\nhouses, churches, and stores, are poor for the capital city of a\r\nTerritory or State. This is a defect which is presently cured, in the\r\nstirring northern regions of the United States. Wooden planks, laid on\r\nthe grass, form the pavement, in all the outskirts of the place. The\r\ndeficiency is of stone, not of labour. Thousands of settlers are\r\npouring in every year; and of these, many are Irish, Germans, or Dutch,\r\nworking their way into the back country, and glad to be employed for a\r\nwhile at Detroit, to earn money to carry them further. Paving-stones\r\nwill be imported here, I suppose, as I saw them at New Orleans, to the\r\ngreat improvement of the health and comfort of the place. The block-wood\r\npavement, of which trial has been made in a part of Broadway, New York,\r\nis thought likely to answer better at Detroit than any other kind, and\r\nis going to be tried.\r\n\r\nThe country round Detroit is as flat as can be imagined; and, indeed, it\r\nis said that the highest mountain in the State boasts only sixty feet of\r\nelevation. A lady of Detroit once declared, that if she were to build a\r\nhouse in Michigan, she would build a hill first. The Canada side of the\r\nriver looks dull enough from the city; but I cannot speak from a near\r\nview of it, having been disappointed in my attempts to get over to it.\r\nOn one occasion, we were too late for the ferry-boat; and we never had\r\ntime again for the excursion.\r\n\r\nA cool wind from the northern lakes blows over the whole face of the\r\ncountry, in the midst of the hottest days of summer; and in the depth of\r\nwinter, the snow never lies deep, nor long. These circumstances may\r\npartly account for the healthiness of the row of faces at the table of\r\nthe American.\r\n\r\nThe society of Detroit is very choice; and, as it has continued so since\r\nthe old colonial days, through the territorial days, there is every\r\nreason to think that it will become, under its new dignities, a more and\r\nmore desirable place of residence. Some of its interior society is still\r\nvery youthful; a gentleman, for instance, saying in the reading-room, in\r\nthe hearing of one of our party, that, though it did not sound well at\r\na distance, Lynching[10] was the only way to treat Abolitionists: but\r\nthe most enlightened society is, I believe, equal to any which is to be\r\nfound in the United States. Here we began to see some of the\r\nhalf-breeds, of whom we afterwards met so many at the north. They are\r\nthe children of white men who have married squaws; and may be known at a\r\nglance, not only by the dark complexion, but by the high cheekbones,\r\nstraight black hair, and an indescribable mischievous expression about\r\nthe eyes. I never saw such imps and Flibbertigibbets as the half-breed\r\nboys that we used to see rowing or diving in the waters, or playing\r\npranks on the shores of Michigan.\r\n\r\nWe had two great pleasures this day; a drive along the quiet Lake St.\r\nClair, and a charming evening party at General Mason's. After a\r\npilgrimage through the State of New York, a few exciting days at\r\nNiagara, and a disagreeable voyage along Lake Erie, we were prepared to\r\nenjoy to the utmost the novelty of a good evening party; and we were as\r\nmerry as children at a ball. It was wholly unexpected to find ourselves\r\nin accomplished society on the far side of Lake Erie; and there was\r\nsomething stimulating in the contrast between the high civilisation of\r\nthe evening, and the primitive scenes that we were to plunge into the\r\nnext day. Though we had to pack up and write, and be off very early in\r\nthe morning, we were unable to persuade ourselves to go home till late;\r\nand then we talked over Detroit as if we were wholly at leisure.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of Lake St. Clair was new to me. I had seen nothing in the\r\nUnited States like its level green banks, with trees slanting over the\r\nwater, festooned with the wild vine; the groups of cattle beneath them;\r\nthe distant steam-boat, scarcely seeming to disturb the grey surface of\r\nthe still waters. This was the first of many scenes in Michigan which\r\nmade me think of Holland; though the day of canals has not yet arrived.\r\n\r\n15th. An obliging girl at the American provided us with coffee and\r\nbiscuits at half-past five, by which time our \"exclusive extra\" was at\r\nthe door. Charley had lost his cap. It was impossible that he should go\r\nbare-headed through the State; and it was lucky for us that a store was\r\nalready open where he was furnished in a trice with a willow-hat. The\r\nbrimming river was bright in the morning sun; and our road was, for a\r\nmile or two, thronged with Indians. Some of the inhabitants of Detroit,\r\nwho knew the most about their dark neighbours, told me that they found\r\nit impossible to be romantic about these poor creatures. We, however,\r\ncould not help feeling the excitement of the spectacle, when we saw them\r\nstanding in their singularly majestic attitudes by the road-side, or on\r\na rising ground: one, with a bunch of feathers tied at the back of the\r\nhead; another, with his arms folded in his blanket; and a third, with\r\nher infant lashed to a board, and thus carried on her shoulders. Their\r\nappearance was dreadfully squalid.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had entered the woods, the roads became as bad as, I\r\nsuppose, roads ever are. Something snapped, and the driver cried out\r\nthat we were \"broke to bits.\" The team-bolt had given way. Our\r\ngentlemen, and those of the mail-stage, which happened to be at hand,\r\nhelped to mend the coach; and we ladies walked on, gathering abundance\r\nof flowers, and picking our way along the swampy corduroy road. In less\r\nthan an hour, the stage took us up, and no more accidents happened\r\nbefore breakfast. We were abundantly amused while our meal was preparing\r\nat Danversville. One of the passengers of the mail-stage took up a\r\nviolin, and offered to play to us. Books with pictures were lying about.\r\nThe lady of the house sat by the window, fixing her candle-wicks into\r\nthe moulds. In the piazza, sat a party of emigrants, who interested us\r\nmuch. The wife had her eight children with her; the youngest, puny\r\ntwins. She said she had brought them in a wagon four hundred miles; and\r\nif they could only live through the one hundred that remained before\r\nthey reached her husband's lot of land, she hoped they might thrive; but\r\nshe had been robbed, the day before, of her bundle of baby things. Some\r\none had stolen it from the wagon. After a good meal, we saw the\r\nstage-passengers stowed into a lumber wagon; and we presently followed\r\nin our more comfortable vehicle.\r\n\r\nBefore long, something else snapped. The splinter-bar was broken. The\r\ndriver was mortified; but it was no fault of his. Juggernaut's car would\r\nhave been \"broke to bits\" on such a road. We went into a settler's\r\nhouse, where we were welcomed to rest and refresh ourselves. Three years\r\nbefore, the owner bought his eighty acres of land for a dollar an acre.\r\nHe could now sell it for twenty dollars an acre. He shot, last year, a\r\nhundred deer, and sold them for three dollars a-piece. He and his family\r\nneed have no fears of poverty. We dined well, nine miles before reaching\r\nYpsilanti. The log-houses,--always comfortable when well made, being\r\neasily kept clean, cool in summer, and warm in winter,--have here an air\r\nof beauty about them. The hue always harmonizes well with the soil and\r\nvegetation. Those in Michigan have the bark left on, and the corners\r\nsawn off close; and are thus both picturesque and neat.\r\n\r\nAt Ypsilanti, I picked up an Ann Arbor newspaper. It was badly printed;\r\nbut its contents were pretty good; and it could happen nowhere out of\r\nAmerica, that so raw a settlement as that at Ann Arbor, where there is\r\ndifficulty in procuring decent accommodations, should have a newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt was past seven before we left the inn at Ypsilanti, to go thirteen\r\nmiles further. We departed on foot. There was a bridge building at\r\nYpsilanti; but, till it was ready, all vehicles had to go a mile down\r\nthe water-side to the ferry, while the passengers generally preferred\r\ncrossing the foot-bridge, and walking on through the wood. We found in\r\nour path, lupins, wild geraniums, blue-eye grass, blue iris, wild\r\nsunflower, and many others. The mild summer night was delicious, after\r\nthe fatigues of the day. I saw the youngest of golden moons, and two\r\nbright stars set, before we reached Wallace's Tavern, where we were to\r\nsleep. Of course, we were told that there was no room for us; but, by a\r\nlittle coaxing and management, and one of the party consenting to sleep\r\non the parlour-floor, everything was made easy.\r\n\r\n16th. We were off by half-past six; and, not having rested quite enough,\r\nand having the prospect of fourteen miles before breakfast, we, with one\r\naccord, finished our sleep in the stage. We reached Tecumseh by\r\nhalf-past nine, and perceived that its characteristic was chair-making.\r\nEvery other house seemed to be a chair manufactory. One bore the\r\ninscription, \"Cousin George's Store:\" the meaning of which I do not\r\npretend to furnish. Perhaps the idea is, that purchasers may feel free\r\nand easy, as if dealing with cousin George. Everybody has a cousin\r\nGeorge. Elsewhere, we saw a little hotel inscribed, \"Our House;\" a\r\nprettier sign than \"Traveller's Rest,\" or any other such tempting\r\ninvitation that I am acquainted with. At Tecumseh, I saw the first\r\nstrawberries of the season. All that I tasted in Michigan, of prairie\r\ngrowth, were superior to those of the west, grown in gardens.\r\n\r\nCharley was delighted to-day by the sight of several spotted fawns,\r\ntamed by children. If a fawn be carried a hundred yards from its bush,\r\nit will follow the finder, and remain with him, if kindly treated. They\r\nare prettiest when very young, as they afterwards lose their spots.\r\n\r\nWe fairly entered the \"rolling country\" to-day: and nothing could be\r\nbrighter and more flourishing than it looked. The young corn was coming\r\nup well in the settlers' fields. The copses, called \"oak-openings,\"\r\nlooked fresh after the passing thunder-showers; and so did the rising\r\ngrounds, strewed with wild flowers and strawberries. \"The little hills\r\nrejoiced on every side.\" The ponds, gleaming between the hills and\r\ncopses, gave a park-like air to the scenery. The settlers leave trees in\r\ntheir clearings; and from these came the song of the wood-thrush; and\r\nfrom the dells the cry of the quail. There seemed to be a gay\r\nwood-pecker to every tree.\r\n\r\nOur only accident to-day was driving over a poor hog: we can only hope\r\nit died soon. Wherever we stopped, we found that the crowds of emigrants\r\nhad eaten up all the eggs; and we happened to think eggs the best\r\narticle of diet of all on a journey. It occurred to me that we might get\r\nsome by the way, and carry them on to our resting-place. All agreed\r\nthat we might probably procure them: but how to carry them safely over\r\nsuch roads was the question. This day we resolved to try. We made a\r\nsolemn stir for eggs in a small settlement; and procured a dozen. We\r\neach carried one in each hand,--except Charley, who was too young to be\r\ntrusted. His two were wrapped up each in a bag. During eight miles of\r\njolting, not one was hurt; and we delivered them to our host at\r\nJonesville with much satisfaction. We wished that some of our\r\nentertainers had been as rich as a Frenchman at Baltimore, who, talking\r\nof his poultry-yard, informed a friend that he had \"fifty head of hen.\"\r\n\r\nAt Jonesville, the ladies and Charley were favoured with a large and\r\ncomfortable chamber. The gentlemen had to sleep with the multitude\r\nbelow; ranged like walking-sticks, or umbrellas, on a shop-counter.\r\n\r\n17th. The road was more deplorable than ever to-day. The worst of it\r\nwas, that whenever it was dangerous for the carriage, so that we were\r\nobliged to get out, it was, in proportion, difficult to be passed on\r\nfoot. It was amusing to see us in such passes as we had to go through\r\nto-day. I generally acted as pioneer, the gentlemen having their ladies\r\nto assist; and it was pleasant to stand on some dry perch, and watch my\r\ncompanions through the holes and pools that I had passed. Such hopping\r\nand jumping; such slipping and sliding; such looks of despair from the\r\nmiddle of a pond; such shifting of logs, and carrying of planks, and\r\nhanding along the fallen trunks of trees! The driver, meantime, was\r\nlooking back provokingly from his box, having dragged the carriage\r\nthrough; and far behind stood Charley, high and dry, singing or eating\r\nhis bit of bread, till his father could come back for him. Three times\r\nthis day was such a scene enacted; and, the third time, there was a\r\nparty of emigrant ladies to be assisted, too. When it was all over, and\r\nI saw one with her entire feet cased in mud, I concluded we must all be\r\nvery wet, and looked at my own shoes: and lo! even the soles were as dry\r\nas when they were made! How little the worst troubles of travelling\r\namount to, in proportion to the apprehension of them! What a world of\r\nanxiety do travellers suffer lest they should get wet, or be without\r\nfood! How many really faint with hunger, or fall into an ague with damp\r\nand cold? I was never in danger of either the one or the other, in any\r\nof the twenty-three States which I visited.\r\n\r\nAt one part of our journey to-day, where the road was absolutely\r\nimpassable, we went above a mile through the wood, where there was no\r\ntrack, but where the trees are blazed, to serve as guide-posts, summer\r\nand winter. It was very wild. Our carriage twisted and wound about to\r\navoid blows against the noble beech-stems. The waters of the swamp\r\nplashed under our wheels, and the boughs crunched overhead. An overturn\r\nwould have been a disaster in such a place. We travelled only forty-two\r\nmiles this long day; but the weariness of the way was much beguiled by\r\nsinging, by a mock oration, story-telling, and other such amusements.\r\nThe wit and humour of Americans, abundant under ordinary circumstances,\r\nare never, I believe, known to fail in emergencies, serious or trifling.\r\nTheir humour helps themselves and their visitors through any Sloughs of\r\nDespond, as charitably as their infinite abundance of logs through the\r\nswamps of their bad roads.\r\n\r\nWe did not reach Sturgis's Prairie till night. We had heard so poor an\r\naccount of the stage-house, that we proceeded to another, whose owner\r\nhas the reputation of treating his guests magnificently, or not at all.\r\nHe treated us on _juste milieu_ principles. He did what he could for us;\r\nand that could not be called magnificent. The house was crowded with\r\nemigrants. When, after three hours waiting, we had supper, two\r\nfull-grown persons were asleep on some blankets in the corner of the\r\nroom, and as many as fifteen or sixteen children on chairs and on the\r\nfloor. Our hearts ached for one mother. Her little girl, two years old,\r\nhad either sprained or broken her arm, and the mother did not know what\r\nto do with it. The child shrieked when the arm was touched, and wailed\r\nmournfully at other times. We found in the morning, however, that she\r\nhad had some sleep. I have often wondered since how she bore the motion\r\nof the wagon on the worst parts of the road. It was oppressively hot. I\r\nhad a little closet, whose door would not shut, and which was too small\r\nto give me room to take off the soft feather-bed. The window would not\r\nkeep open without being propped by the tin water-jug; and though this\r\nwas done, I could not sleep for the heat. This reminds me of the\r\nconsiderate kindness of an hotel-keeper in an earlier stage of our\r\njourney. When he found that I wished to have my window open, there being\r\nno fastening, he told me he would bring his own tooth-brush for a\r\nprop,--which he accordingly did.\r\n\r\n18th. Our drive of twelve miles to breakfast was very refreshing. The\r\nroads were the best we had travelled since we left New York State. We\r\npassed through a wilderness of flowers; trailing roses, enormous white\r\nconvolvulus, scarlet lilies, and ground-ivy, with many others, being\r\nadded to those we had before seen. Milton must have travelled in\r\nMichigan before he wrote the garden parts of \"Paradise Lost.\" Sturgis's\r\nand White Pigeon Prairies are highly cultivated, and look just like any\r\nother rich and perfectly level land. We breakfasted at White Pigeon\r\nPrairie, and saw the rising ground where the Indian chief lies buried,\r\nwhose name has been given to the place.\r\n\r\nThe charms of the settlement, to us, were a kind landlady, an admirable\r\nbreakfast, at which eggs abounded, and a blooming garden. Thirty-seven\r\nmiles further brought us to Niles, where we arrived by five in the\r\nafternoon. The roads were so much improved that we had not to walk at\r\nall; which was well, as there was much pelting rain during the day.\r\n\r\nNiles is a thriving town on the river St. Joseph, on the borders of the\r\nPotowatomie territory. Three years ago, it consisted of three houses. We\r\ncould not learn the present number of inhabitants; probably because the\r\nnumber is never the same two days together. A Potowatomie village stands\r\nwithin a mile; and we saw two Indians on horseback, fording the rapid\r\nriver very majestically, and ascending the wooded hills on the other\r\nside. Many Indian women were about the streets; one with a nose-ring;\r\nsome with plates of silver on the bosom, and other barbaric ornaments.\r\nSuch a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning came on, with a deluge\r\nof rain, that we were prevented seeing anything of the place, except\r\nfrom our windows. I had sent my boots to a cobbler, over the way. He had\r\nto put on India rubbers, which reached above the knee, to bring his work\r\nhome; the street was so flooded. We little imagined for the hour the\r\nreal extent and violence of this storm, and the effect it would have on\r\nour journeying.\r\n\r\nThe prairie strawberries, at breakfast this morning, were so large,\r\nsweet, and ripe, that we were inclined for more in the course of the\r\nday. Many of the children of the settlers were dispersed near the\r\nroad-side, with their baskets, gathering strawberries; they would not\r\nsell any: they did not know what mother would say if they went home\r\nwithout any berries for father. But they could get enough for father,\r\ntoo, they were told, if they would sell us what they had already\r\ngathered. No; they did not want to sell. Our driver observed, that money\r\nwas \"no object to them.\" I began to think that we had, at last, got to\r\nthe end of the world; or rather, perhaps, to the beginning of another\r\nand a better.\r\n\r\n19th. No plan could be more cleverly and confidently laid than ours was\r\nfor this day's journey. We were to travel through the lands of the\r\nPotowatomies, and reach the shores of the glorious Lake Michigan, at\r\nMichigan City, in time for an early supper. We were to proceed on the\r\nmorrow round the southern extremity of the lake, so as, if possible, to\r\nreach Chicago in one day. It was wisely and prettily planned: and the\r\nplan was so far followed, as that we actually did leave Niles some time\r\nbefore six in the morning. Within three minutes, it began to rain again,\r\nand continued, with but few and short intervals, all day.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the St. Joseph by a rope ferry, the ingenious management of\r\nwhich, when stage-coaches had to be carried over, was a perpetual study\r\nto me. The effect of crossing a rapid river by a rope-ferry, by\r\ntorch-light, in a dark night, is very striking; and not the less so for\r\none's becoming familiarized with it, as the traveller does in the United\r\nStates. As we drove up the steep bank, we found ourselves in the Indian\r\nterritory. All was very wild; and the more so for the rain. There were\r\nmany lodges in the glades, with the red light of fires hanging around\r\nthem. The few log huts looked drenched; the tree-stems black in the wet;\r\nand the very wild flowers were dripping. The soil was sandy; so that the\r\nugliest features of a rainy day, the mud and puddles, were obviated.\r\nThe sand sucked up the rain, so that we jumped out of the carriage as\r\noften as a wild-flower of peculiar beauty tempted us. The bride-like,\r\nwhite convolvulus, nearly as large as my hand, grew in trails all over\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe poor, helpless, squalid Potowatomies are sadly troubled by\r\nsquatters. It seems hard enough that they should be restricted within a\r\nnarrow territory, so surrounded by whites that the game is sure soon to\r\ndisappear, and leave them stripped of their only resource. It is too\r\nhard that they should also be encroached upon by men who sit down,\r\nwithout leave or title, upon lands which are not intended for sale. I\r\nenjoyed hearing of an occasional alarm among the squatters, caused by\r\nsome threatening demonstrations by the Indians. I should like to see\r\nevery squatter frightened away from Indian lands, however advantageous\r\ntheir squatting may be upon lands which are unclaimed, or whose owners\r\ncan defend their own property. I was glad to hear to-day that a\r\ndeputation of Potowatomies had been sent to visit a distant warlike\r\ntribe, in consequence of the importunities of squatters, who wanted to\r\nbuy the land they had been living upon. The deputation returned,\r\npainted, and under other hostile signals, and declared that the\r\nPotowatomies did not intend to part with their lands. We stopped for\r\nsome milk, this morning, at the \"location\" of a squatter, whose wife was\r\nmilking as we passed. The gigantic personage, her husband, told us how\r\nanxious he was to pay for the land which repaid his tillage so well; but\r\nthat his Indian neighbours would not sell. I hope that, by this time, he\r\nhas had to remove, and leave them the benefit of his house and fences.\r\nSuch an establishment in the wild woods is the destruction of the\r\ngame,--and of those who live upon it.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, we saw a fine specimen of a settler's family. We had\r\nobserved the prosperity and cheerfulness of the settlers, all along the\r\nroad; but this family exceeded the best. I never saw such an\r\naffectionate set of people. They, like many others, were from one of the\r\nsouthern States: and I was not surprised to find all emigrants from\r\nNorth and South Carolina well satisfied with the change they had made.\r\nThe old lady seemed to enjoy her pipe, and there was much mirth going on\r\nbetween the beautiful daughter and all the other men and maidens. They\r\ngave us an excellent breakfast in one of the two lower rooms; the table\r\nbeing placed across the foot of the two beds. No pains were spared by\r\nthem to save us from the wet in the stage; but the rain was too pelting\r\nand penetrating for any defence to avail long. It streamed in at all\r\ncorners, and we gave the matter up for the day. We were now entering\r\nIndiana; and one of our intentions had been to see the celebrated Door\r\nPrairie; so called from exquisite views into it being opened through\r\nintervals in the growth of wood with which it is belted. I did obtain\r\nsomething like an idea of it through the reeking rain, and thought that\r\nit was the first prairie that I had seen that answered to my idea of\r\none. But I dare say we formed no conception of what it must be in\r\nsunshine, and with the cloud shadows, which adorn a prairie as they do\r\nstill water.\r\n\r\nWe reached Laporte, on the edge of the Door Prairie, at three o'clock,\r\nand were told that the weather did not promise an easy access to\r\nMichigan City. We changed horses, however, and set forward again on a\r\nvery bad road, along the shore of a little lake, which must be pretty in\r\nfine weather. Then we entered a wood, and jolted and rocked from side to\r\nside, till, at last, the carriage leaned three parts over, and stuck. We\r\nall jumped out into the rain, and the gentlemen literally put their\r\nshoulders to the wheel, and lifted it out of its hole. The same little\r\nincident was repeated in half an hour. At five or six miles from\r\nLaporte, and seven from Michigan City, our driver stopped, and held a\r\nlong parley with somebody by the road side. The news was that a bridge\r\nin the middle of a marsh had been carried away by a tremendous freshet;\r\nand with how much log-road on either side, could not be ascertained till\r\nthe waters should subside. The mails, however, would have to be carried\r\nover, by some means, the next day; and we must wait where we were till\r\nwe could profit by the post-office experiment. The next question was,\r\nwhere were we to be harboured? There was no house of entertainment near.\r\nWe shrank from going back to Laporte over the perilous road which was\r\ngrowing worse every minute. A family lived at hand, who hospitably\r\noffered to receive us; and we were only too ready to accept their\r\nkindness. The good man stopped our acknowledgments by saying, in the\r\nmost cheerful manner, \"You know you would not have staid with me, if you\r\ncould have helped it; and I would not have had you, if I could have\r\nhelped it: so no more words about it; but let us make ourselves\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nWe perceived by a glance at the beard and costume of our host, that\r\nthere was something remarkable about him. He was of the Tunker sect of\r\nBaptists, (from _Tunken_, to dip,) a very peculiar sect of religionists.\r\nHe explained, without any reserve, his faith, and the reasons on which\r\nit was founded.\r\n\r\nIt was all interesting, as showing how the true and the fanciful, the\r\nprinciple and the emblem, the eternal truth and the supposed type, may\r\nbecome all mixed together, so as to be received alike as articles of\r\nfaith. This man might almost compare with Origen in his mystical\r\ndivinations of scripture. The most profitable and delightful part of\r\nhis communication related to the operation upon his life and fortunes of\r\nhis peace principles. He had gone through life on the non-resistance\r\nprinciple; and it was animating to learn how well it had served him; as\r\nevery high exercise of faith does serve every one who has strength and\r\nsimplicity of heart to commit himself to it. It was animating to learn,\r\nnot only his own consistency, but the force of his moral power over\r\nothers; how the careless had been won to thoughtfulness of his\r\ninterests, and the criminal to respect of his rights. He seemed to have\r\nunconsciously secured the promise and the fruit of the life that now is,\r\nmore effectually than many who think less of that which is to come. It\r\nwas done, he said, by always supposing that the good was in men. His\r\nwife won our hearts by the beauty of her countenance, set off by the\r\nneat plain dress of her sect. She was ill; but they made us thoroughly\r\ncomfortable, without apparently discomposing themselves. Sixteen out of\r\nseventeen children were living; of whom two sons and five daughters were\r\nabsent, and six sons and three daughters at home: the youngest was three\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nTheir estate consists of eight hundred acres, a large portion of which\r\nis not yet broken up. The owner says he walks over the ground once a\r\nyear, to see the huckleberries grow. He gave the upset price for the\r\nland; a dollar and a-quarter an acre. He is now offered forty dollars an\r\nacre, and says the land is worth fifty, its situation being very\r\nadvantageous; but he does not wish to sell. He has thus become worth\r\n40,000 dollars in the three years which have elapsed since he came out\r\nof Ohio. His sons, as they grow up, settle at a distance; and he does\r\nnot want money, and has no inducement to sell. I have no idea, however,\r\nthat the huckleberries will be long permitted to grow in peace and\r\nquiet, in so busy a district as this is destined to become. The good man\r\nwill be constrained by the march and pressure of circumstances, either\r\nto sell or cultivate.\r\n\r\nThe house, log-built, consisted of three rooms; two under one roof; and\r\nanother apparently added afterwards. There were also out-houses. In one\r\nof these three rooms, the cooking and eating went on; another was given\r\nup to us ladies, with a few of the little children; and in the other,\r\nthe rest of the family, the gentlemen of our party, and another\r\nweather-bound traveller, slept. Huge fires of logs blazed in the\r\nchimneys; two or three of the little ones were offered us as\r\nhand-maidens; and the entire abode was as clean as could be conceived.\r\nHere was comfort!\r\n\r\nAs we warmed and dried ourselves in the chimney corners, and looked upon\r\nthe clear windows, the bright tin water-pails, and the sheets and towels\r\nas white as snow, we had only one anxiety. It was necessary for Mr. and\r\nMrs. L. to be at home, a thousand miles off, by a particular day. We had\r\nalready met with some delays; and there was no seeing the end of the\r\npresent adventure. There was some doubt whether we should not have done\r\nbetter to cross the southern end of Lake Michigan, from Niles to\r\nChicago, by a little steam-boat, the Delaware, which was to leave Niles\r\na few hours after our stage. It had been thought of at Niles; but there\r\nwas some uncertainty about the departure of the boat; and we all\r\nanxiously desired to skirt the extremity of this great inland sea, and\r\nto see the new settlements on its shores. Had we done right in incurring\r\nthis risk of detention? Right or wrong, here we were; and here we must\r\nwait upon events.\r\n\r\nOur sleep, amidst the luxury of cleanliness and hospitality, was most\r\nrefreshing. The next morning it was still raining, but less vehemently.\r\nAfter breakfast, we ladies employed ourselves in sweeping and dusting\r\nour room, and making the beds; as we had given our kind hostess too much\r\ntrouble already. Then there was a Michigan City newspaper to be read;\r\nand I sat down to write letters. Before long, a wagon and four drove up\r\nto the door, the driver of which cried out that if there was any getting\r\nto Michigan City, he was our man. We equipped ourselves in our warmest\r\nand thickest clothing, put on our india rubber shoes, packed ourselves\r\nand our luggage in the wagon, put up our umbrellas, and wondered what\r\nwas to be our fate. When it had come to saying farewell, our hostess put\r\nher hands on my shoulders, kissed me on each cheek, and said she had\r\nhoped for the pleasure of our company for another day. For my own part,\r\nI would willingly take her at her word, if my destiny should ever carry\r\nme near the great lakes again.\r\n\r\nWe jolted on for two miles and a half through the woods, admiring the\r\nscarlet lilies, and the pink and white moccasin flower, which was\r\nbrilliant. Then we arrived at the place of the vanished bridge. Our\r\nfirst prospect was of being paddled over, one by one, in the smallest of\r\nboats. But, when the capabilities of the place were examined, it was\r\ndecided that we should wait in a house on the hill, while the\r\nneighbours, the passengers of the mail-stage, and the drivers, built a\r\nbridge. We waited patiently for nearly three hours, watching the busy\r\nmen going in and out, gathering tidings of the freshet, and its effects,\r\nand being pleased to see how affectionate the woman of the house was to\r\nher husband, while she was cross to everybody else. It must have been\r\nvexatious to her to have her floor made wet and dirty, and all her\r\nhousehold operations disturbed by a dozen strangers whom she had never\r\ninvited. She let us have some dough nuts, and gave us a gracious glance\r\nor two at parting.\r\n\r\nWe learned that a gentleman who followed us from Niles, the preceding\r\nday, found the water nine feet deep, and was near drowning his horses,\r\nin a place which we had crossed without difficulty. This very morning, a\r\nbridge which we had proved and passed, gave way with the stage, and the\r\nhorses had to be dug and rolled out of the mud, when they were on the\r\npoint of suffocation. Such a freshet had never been known to the present\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nOur driver was an original; and so were some of the other muddy\r\ngentlemen who came in to dry themselves, after their bridge making. One\r\nasked if such an one was not a \"smart fellow.\" \"He! he can't see through\r\na ladder.\" Our driver informed us, \"when they send a man to jail here,\r\nthey put him abroad into the woods. Only, they set a man after him, that\r\nthey may knew where he is.\" A pretty expensive method of imprisonment,\r\nthough there be no bills for jail building. This man conversed with his\r\nhorses in much the same style as with us, averring that they understood\r\nhim as well. On one occasion, he boxed the ears of one of the leaders,\r\nfor not standing still when bidden, declaring, \"If you go on doing so,\r\nI'll give you something you can't buy at the grocer's shop.\" I was not\r\nbefore aware that there was anything that was not to be bought at a\r\nback-country grocer's shop.\r\n\r\nAt half-past two, the bridge was announced complete, and we re-entered\r\nour wagon, to lead the cavalcade across it. Slowly, anxiously, with a\r\nman at the head of each leader, we entered the water, and saw it rise to\r\nthe nave of the wheels. Instead of jolting, as usual, we mounted and\r\ndescended each log individually. The mail-wagon followed, with two or\r\nthree horsemen. There was also a singularly benevolent personage, who\r\njumped from the other wagon, and waded through all the doubtful places,\r\nto prove them. He leaped and splashed through the water, which was\r\nsometimes up to his waist, as if it was the most agreeable sport in the\r\nworld. In one of these gullies, the fore part of our wagon sank and\r\nstuck, so as to throw us forward, and make it doubtful in what mode we\r\nshould emerge from the water. Then the rim of one of the wheels was\r\nfound to be loose; and the whole cavalcade stopped till it was mended. I\r\nnever could understand how wagons were made in the back-country; they\r\nseemed to be elastic, from the shocks and twisting they would bear\r\nwithout giving way. To form an accurate idea of what they have to bear,\r\na traveller should sit on a seat without springs, placed between the\r\nhind wheels, and thus proceed on a corduroy road. The effect is less\r\nfatiguing and more amusing, of riding in a wagon whose seats are on\r\nsprings, while the vehicle itself is not. In that case, the feet are\r\ndancing an involuntary jig, all the way; while the rest of the body is\r\nin a state of entire repose.\r\n\r\nThe drive was so exciting and pleasant, the rain having ceased, that I\r\nwas taken by surprise by our arrival at Michigan City. The driver\r\nannounced our approach by a series of flourishes on one note of his\r\ncommon horn, which made the most ludicrous music I ever listened to. How\r\nmany minutes he went on, I dare not say; but we were so convulsed with\r\nlaughter that we could not alight with becoming gravity, amidst the\r\ngroups in the piazza of the hotel. The man must be first cousin to\r\nPaganini.\r\n\r\nSuch a city as this was surely never before seen. It is three years\r\nsince it was begun; and it is said to have one thousand five hundred\r\ninhabitants. It is cut out of the forest, and curiously interspersed\r\nwith little swamps, which we no doubt saw in their worst condition after\r\nthe heavy rains. New, good houses, some only half finished, stood in the\r\nmidst of the thick wood. A large area was half cleared. The finished\r\nstores were scattered about; and the streets were littered with stumps.\r\nThe situation is beautiful. The undulations of the ground, within and\r\nabout it, and its being closed in by lake or forest on every side,\r\nrender it unique. An appropriation has been made by Government for a\r\nharbour; and two piers are to be built out beyond the sand, as far as\r\nthe clay soil of the lake. Mr. L---- and I were anxious to see the\r\nmighty fresh water sea. We made inquiry in the piazza; and a sandy hill,\r\nclose by, covered with the pea vine, was pointed out to us. We ran up\r\nit, and there beheld what we had come so far to see. There it was, deep,\r\ngreen, and swelling on the horizon, and whitening into a broad and heavy\r\nsurf as it rolled in towards the shore. Hence, too, we could make out\r\nthe geography of the city. The whole scene stands insulated in my\r\nmemory, as absolutely singular; and, at this distance of time, scarcely\r\ncredible. I was so well aware on the spot that it would be so, that I\r\nmade careful and copious notes of what I saw: but memoranda have nothing\r\nto do with such emotions as were caused by the sight of that enormous\r\nbody of tumultuous waters, rolling in apparently upon the helpless\r\nforest,--everywhere else so majestic.\r\n\r\nThe day was damp and chilly, as we were told every day is here. There is\r\nscarcely ever a day of summer in which fire is not acceptable. The\r\nwindows were dim; the metals rusted, and the new wood about the house\r\nred with damp. We could not have a fire. The storm had thrown down a\r\nchimney; and the house was too full of workmen, providing accommodation\r\nfor future guests, to allow of the comfort of those present being much\r\nattended to. We were permitted to sit round a flue in a chamber, where a\r\nremarkably pretty and graceful girl was sewing. She has a widowed mother\r\nto support, and she \"gets considerable\" by sewing here, where the women\r\nlead a bustling life, which leaves no time for the needle. We had to\r\nwait long for something to eat; that is, till supper time; for the\r\npeople are too busy to serve up anything between meals. Two little girls\r\nbrought a music book, and sang to us; and then we sang to them; and then\r\nDr. F. brought me two harebells.--one of the rarest flowers in the\r\ncountry. I found some at Trenton Falls; and in one or two other rocky\r\nand sandy places; but so seldom as to make a solitary one a great\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nOur supper of young pork, good bread, potatoes, preserves, and tea, was\r\nserved at two tables, where the gentlemen were in proportion to the\r\nladies as ten to one. In such places, there is a large proportion of\r\nyoung men who are to go back for wives when they have gathered a few\r\nother comforts about them. The appearance of health was as striking as\r\nat Detroit, and everywhere on this side of Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nImmediately after supper we went for a walk, which, in peculiarity,\r\ncomes next to that in the Mammoth Cave; if, indeed, it be second to it.\r\nThe scene was like what I had always fancied the Norway coast, but for\r\nthe wild flowers, which grew among the pines on the slope, almost into\r\nthe tide. I longed to spend an entire day on this flowery and shadowy\r\nmargin of the inland sea. I plucked handfuls of pea-vine and other\r\ntrailing flowers, which seemed to run over all the ground. We found on\r\nthe sands an army, like Pharaoh's drowned host, of disabled butterflies,\r\nbeetles, and flies of the richest colours and lustre, driven over the\r\nlake by the storm. Charley found a small turtle alive. An elegant little\r\nschooner, \"the Sea Serpent of Chicago,\" was stranded, and formed a\r\nbeautiful object as she lay dark between the sand and the surf. The sun\r\nwas going down. We watched the sunset, not remembering that the\r\nrefraction above the fresh waters would probably cause some remarkable\r\nappearance. We looked at one another in amazement at what we saw. First,\r\nthere were three gay, inverted rainbows between the water and the sun,\r\nthen hidden behind a little streak of cloud. Then the sun emerged from\r\nbehind this only cloud, urn-shaped; a glistering golden urn. Then it\r\nchanged, rather suddenly, to an enormous golden acorn. Then to a precise\r\nresemblance, except being prodigiously magnified, of Saturn with his\r\nring. This was the most beautiful apparition of all. Then it was quickly\r\nnarrowed and elongated till it was like the shaft of a golden pillar;\r\nand thus it went down square. Long after its disappearance, a lustrous,\r\ndeep crimson dome, seemingly solid, rested steadily on the heaving\r\nwaters. An inexperienced navigator might be pardoned for making all sail\r\ntowards it; it looked so real. What do the Indians think of such\r\nphenomena? Probably as the child does of the compass, the upas tree, and\r\nall the marvels of Madame Genlis' story of Alphonso and Dalinda; that\r\nsuch things are no more wonderful than all other things. The age of\r\nwonder from natural appearances has not arrived in children and savages.\r\nIt is one of the privileges of advancing years. A grave Indian, who\r\ncould look with apathy upon the cataract and all the tremendous shows of\r\nthe wilderness, found himself in a glass-house at Pittsburg. He saw a\r\nglassblower put a handle upon a pitcher. The savage was transported out\r\nof his previous silence and reserve. He seized and grasped the hand of\r\nthe workman, crying out that it was now plain that he had had\r\nintercourse with the Great Spirit. I remember in my childhood, being\r\nmore struck with seeing a square box made in three minutes out of a\r\npiece of writing-paper, than with all that I read about the loadstone\r\nand the lunar influence upon the tides. In those days I should have\r\nlooked upon this Indiana sunset with the same kind of feeling as upon a\r\ncloud which might look \"very like a whale.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked briskly home, beside the skiey sea, with the half-grown moon\r\nabove us, riding high. Then came the struggling for room to lie down,\r\nfor sheets and fresh water. The principal range of chambers could have\r\nbeen of no manner of use to us, in their present state. There were, I\r\nthink, thirty, in one range along a passage. A small bed stood in the\r\nmiddle of each, made up for use; but the walls were as yet only scantily\r\nlathed, without any plaster; so that everything was visible along the\r\nwhole row. They must have been designed for persons who cannot see\r\nthrough a ladder.\r\n\r\nWhen I arose at daybreak, I found myself stiff with cold. No wonder: the\r\nwindow, close to my head, had lost a pane. I think the business of a\r\nperambulating glazier might be a very profitable one, in most parts of\r\nthe United States. When we seated ourselves in our wagon, we found that\r\nthe leathern cushions were soaked with wet; like so many sponges. They\r\nwere taken in to a hot fire, and soon brought out, each sending up a\r\ncloud of steam. Blankets were furnished to lay over them; and we set\r\noff. We were cruelly jolted through the bright dewy woods, for four\r\nmiles, and then arrived on the borders of a swamp where the bridge had\r\nbeen carried away. A man waded in; declared the depth to be more than\r\nsix feet; how much more he could not tell. There was nothing to be done\r\nbut to go back. Back again we jolted, and arrived at the piazza of the\r\nhotel just as the breakfast-bell was ringing. All the \"force\" that could\r\nbe collected on a hasty summons,--that is, almost every able-bodied man\r\nin the city and neighbourhood, was sent out with axes to build us a\r\nbridge. We breakfasted, gathered and dried flowers, and wandered about\r\ntill ten o'clock, when we were summoned to try our fortune again in the\r\nwagon. We found a very pretty scene at the swamp. Part of the \"force\"\r\nwas engaged on our side of the swamp, and part on the other. As we sat\r\nunder the trees, making garlands and wreaths of flowers and oakleaves\r\nfor Charley, we could see one lofty tree-top after another, in the\r\nopposite forest, tremble and fall; and the workmen cluster about it,\r\nlike bees, lop off its branches, and, in a trice, roll it, an ugly log,\r\ninto the water, and pin it down upon the sleepers. Charley was as busy\r\nas anybody, making islands in the water at the edge of the marsh. The\r\nmoccasin flower grew here in great profusion and splendour. We sat thus\r\nupwards of two hours; and the work done in that time appeared almost\r\nincredible. But the Americans in the back country seem to like the\r\nrepairing of accidents--a social employment--better than their regular\r\nlabour; and even the drivers appeared to prefer adventurous travelling\r\nto easy journeys. A gentleman in a light gig made the first trial of the\r\nnew bridge: our wagon followed, plunging and rocking, and we scrambled\r\nin safety up the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nThere were other bad places in the road, but none which occasioned\r\nfurther delay. The next singular scene was an expanse of sand, before\r\nreaching the lake-shore,--sand, so extensive, hot, and dazzling, as to\r\nrealise very fairly one's conceptions of the middle of the Great Desert;\r\nexcept for the trailing roses which skirted it. I walked on, a-head of\r\nthe whole party, till I had lost sight of them behind some low\r\nsand-hills. Other such hills hid the lake from me; and, indeed, I did\r\nnot know how near it was. I had ploughed my way through the ankle-deep\r\nsand till I was much heated, and turned in hope of meeting a breath of\r\nwind. At the moment, the cavalcade came slowly into view from behind the\r\nhills; the labouring horses, the listless walkers, and smoothly rolling\r\nvehicles, all painted absolutely black against the dazzling sand. It was\r\nas good as being in Arabia. For cavalcade, one might read caravan. Then\r\nthe horses were watered at a single house on the beach; and we proceeded\r\non the best part of our day's journey; a ride of seven miles on the hard\r\nsand of the beach, actually in the lapsing waves. We saw another vessel\r\nashore, with her cargo piled upon the beach. The sight of the clear\r\nwaters suggested thoughts of bathing. Charley dearly loves bathing. He\r\nfollows the very natural practice of expressing himself in abstract\r\npropositions when his emotions are the strongest. He heard the\r\nspeculations on the facilities for bathing which might offer at our\r\nresting-place; and besought his mother to let him bathe. He was told\r\nthat it was doubtful whether we should reach our destination before\r\nsunset, and whether any body would be able to try the water. Might he\r\nask his father?--Yes: but he would find his father no more certain than\r\nthe rest of us. \"Mother,\" cried the boy, in an agony of earnestness,\r\n\"does not a father know when his child ought to bathe?\"--There was no\r\nbathing. The sun had set, and it was too cold.\r\n\r\nThe single house at which we were to stop for the night, while the\r\nmail-wagon, with its passengers, proceeded, promised well, at first\r\nsight. It was a log-house on a sand-bank, perfectly clean below stairs,\r\nand prettily dressed with green boughs. We had a good supper, (except\r\nthat there was an absence of milk,) and we concluded ourselves fortunate\r\nin our resting-place. Never was there a greater mistake. We walked out,\r\nafter supper, and when we returned, found that we could not have any\r\nportion of the lower rooms. There was a loft, which I will not describe,\r\ninto which, having ascended a ladder, we were to be all stowed. I would\r\nfain have slept on the soft sand, out of doors, beneath the wagon; but\r\nrain came on. There was no place for us to put our heads into but the\r\nloft. Enough. I will only say that this house was, as far as I remember,\r\nthe only place in the United States where I met with bad treatment.\r\nEverywhere else, people gave me the best they had,--whether it was bad\r\nor good.\r\n\r\nOn our road to Chicago, the next day,--a road winding in and out among\r\nthe sand-hills, we were called to alight, and run up a bank to see a\r\nwreck. It was the wreck of the Delaware;--the steamer in which it had\r\nbeen a question whether we should not proceed from Niles to Chicago. She\r\nhad a singular twist in her middle, where she was nearly broken in two.\r\nHer passengers stood up to the neck in water, for twenty-four hours\r\nbefore they were taken off; a worse inconvenience than any that we had\r\nsuffered by coming the other way. The first thing the passengers from\r\nthe Delaware did, when they had dried and warmed themselves on shore,\r\nwas to sign a letter to the captain, which appeared in all the\r\nneighbouring newspapers, thanking him for the great comfort they had\r\nenjoyed on board his vessel. It is to be presumed that they meant\r\npreviously to their having to stand up to their necks in water.\r\n\r\nIn the wood which borders the prairie on which Chicago stands, we saw an\r\nencampment of United States' troops. Since the rising of the Creeks in\r\nGeorgia, some months before, there had been apprehensions of an Indian\r\nwar along the whole frontier. It was believed that a correspondence had\r\ntaken place among all the tribes, from the Cumanches, who were engaged\r\nto fight for the Mexicans in Texas, up to the northern tribes among\r\nwhom we were going. It was believed that the war-belt was circulating\r\namong the Winnebagoes, the warlike tribe who inhabit the western shores\r\nof Lake Michigan; and the government had sent troops to Chicago, to keep\r\nthem in awe. It was of some consequence to us to ascertain the real\r\nstate of the case; and we were glad to find that alarm was subsiding so\r\nfast, that the troops were soon allowed to go where they were more\r\nwanted. As soon as they had recovered from the storm which seemed to\r\nhave incommoded everybody, they broke up their encampment, and departed.\r\n\r\nChicago looks raw and bare, standing on the high prairie above the\r\nlake-shore. The houses appeared insignificant, and run up in various\r\ndirections, without any principle at all. A friend of mine who resides\r\nthere had told me that we should find the inns intolerable, at the\r\nperiod of the great land sales, which bring a concourse of speculators\r\nto the place. It was even so. The very sight of them was intolerable;\r\nand there was not room for our party among them all. I do not know what\r\nwe should have done, (unless to betake ourselves to the vessels in the\r\nharbour,) if our coming had not been foreknown, and most kindly provided\r\nfor. We were divided between three families, who had the art of removing\r\nall our scruples about intruding on perfect strangers. None of us will\r\nlose the lively and pleasant associations with the place, which were\r\ncaused by the hospitalities of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI never saw a busier place than Chicago was at the time of our arrival.\r\nThe streets were crowded with land speculators, hurrying from one sale\r\nto another. A negro, dressed up in scarlet, bearing a scarlet flag, and\r\nriding a white horse with housings of scarlet, announced the times of\r\nsale. At every street-corner where he stopped, the crowd flocked round\r\nhim; and it seemed as if some prevalent mania infected the whole people.\r\nThe rage for speculation might fairly be so regarded. As the gentlemen\r\nof our party walked the streets, store-keepers hailed them from their\r\ndoors, with offers of farms, and all manner of land-lots, advising them\r\nto speculate before the price of land rose higher. A young lawyer, of my\r\nacquaintance there, had realised five hundred dollars per day, the five\r\npreceding days, by merely making out titles to land. Another friend had\r\nrealised, in two years, ten times as much money as he had before fixed\r\nupon as a competence for life. Of course, this rapid money-making is a\r\nmerely temporary evil. A bursting of the bubble must come soon. The\r\nabsurdity of the speculation is so striking, that the wonder is that the\r\nfever should have attained such a height as I witnessed. The immediate\r\noccasion of the bustle which prevailed, the week we were at Chicago, was\r\nthe sale of lots, to the value of two millions of dollars, along the\r\ncourse of a projected canal; and of another set, immediately behind\r\nthese. Persons not intending to game, and not infected with mania, would\r\nendeavour to form some reasonable conjecture as to the ultimate value of\r\nthe lots, by calculating the cost of the canal, the risks from accident,\r\nfrom the possible competition from other places, &c., and, finally, the\r\npossible profits, under the most favourable circumstances, within so\r\nmany years' purchase. Such a calculation would serve as some sort of\r\nguide as to the amount of purchase-money to be risked. Whereas, wild\r\nland on the banks of a canal, not yet even marked out, was selling at\r\nChicago for more than rich land, well improved, in the finest part of\r\nthe valley of the Mohawk, on the banks of a canal which is already the\r\nmedium of an almost inestimable amount of traffic. If sharpers and\r\ngamblers were to be the sufferers by the impending crash at Chicago, no\r\none would feel much concerned: but they, unfortunately, are the people\r\nwho encourage the delusion, in order to profit by it. Many a\r\nhigh-spirited, but inexperienced, young man; many a simple settler, will\r\nbe ruined for the advantage of knaves.\r\n\r\nOthers, besides lawyers and speculators by trade, make a fortune in such\r\nextraordinary times. A poor man at Chicago had a pre-emption right to\r\nsome land, for which he paid in the morning one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars. In the afternoon, he sold it to a friend of mine for five\r\nthousand dollars. A poor Frenchman, married to a squaw, had a suit\r\npending, when I was there, which he was likely to gain, for the right of\r\npurchasing some land by the lake for one hundred dollars, which would\r\nimmediately become worth one million dollars.\r\n\r\nThere was much gaiety going on at Chicago, as well as business. On the\r\nevening of our arrival a fancy fair took place. As I was too much\r\nfatigued to go, the ladies sent me a bouquet of prairie flowers. There\r\nis some allowable pride in the place about its society. It is a\r\nremarkable thing to meet such an assemblage of educated, refined, and\r\nwealthy persons as may be found there, living in small, inconvenient\r\nhouses on the edge of a wild prairie. There is a mixture, of course. I\r\nheard of a family of half-breeds setting up a carriage, and wearing fine\r\njewellery. When the present intoxication of prosperity passes away, some\r\nof the inhabitants will go back to the eastward; there will be an\r\naccession of settlers from the mechanic classes; good houses will have\r\nbeen built for the richer families, and the singularity of the place\r\nwill subside. It will be like all the other new and thriving lake and\r\nriver ports of America. Meantime, I am glad to have seen it in its\r\nstrange early days.\r\n\r\nWe dined one day with a gentleman who had been Indian agent among the\r\nWinnebagoes for some years. He and his lady seem to have had the art of\r\nmaking themselves as absolutely Indian in their sympathies and manners\r\nas the welfare of the savages among whom they lived required. They were\r\nthe only persons I met with who, really knowing the Indians, had any\r\nregard for them. The testimony was universal to the good faith, and\r\nother virtues of savage life of the unsophisticated Indians; but they\r\nwere spoken of in a tone of dislike, as well as pity, by all but this\r\nfamily; and they certainly had studied their Indian neighbours very\r\nthoroughly. The ladies of Indian agents ought to be women of nerve. Our\r\nhostess had slept for weeks with a loaded pistol on each side her\r\npillow, and a dagger under it, when expecting an attack from a hostile\r\ntribe. The foe did not, however, come nearer than within a few miles.\r\nHer husband's sister was in the massacre when the fort was abandoned, in\r\n1812. Her father and her husband were in the battle, and her mother and\r\nyoung brothers and sisters sat in a boat on the lake near. Out of\r\nseventy whites, only seventeen escaped, among whom were her family. She\r\nwas wounded in the ankle, as she sat on her horse. A painted Indian, in\r\nwarlike costume, came leaping up to her, and seized her horse, as she\r\nsupposed, to murder her. She fought him vigorously, and he bore it\r\nwithout doing her any injury. He spoke, but she could not understand\r\nhim. Another frightful savage came up, and the two led her horse to the\r\nlake, and into it, in spite of her resistance, till the water reached\r\ntheir chins. She concluded that they meant to drown her; but they\r\ncontented themselves with holding her on her horse till the massacre\r\nwas over, when they led her out in safety. They were friendly Indians,\r\nsent by her husband to guard her. She could not but admire their\r\npatience when she found how she had been treating her protectors.\r\n\r\nWe had the fearful pleasure of seeing various savage dances performed by\r\nthe Indian agent and his brother, with the accompaniments of complete\r\ncostume, barbaric music, and whooping. The most intelligible to us was\r\nthe Discovery Dance, a highly descriptive pantomime. We saw the Indian\r\ngo out armed for war. We saw him reconnoitre, make signs to his\r\ncomrades, sleep, warm himself, load his rifle, sharpen his\r\nscalping-knife, steal through the grass within rifle-shot of his foes,\r\nfire, scalp one of them, and dance, whooping and triumphing. There was a\r\ndreadful truth about the whole, and it made our blood run cold. It\r\nrealised hatred and horror as effectually as Taglioni does love and\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nWe were unexpectedly detained over the Sunday at Chicago; and Dr. F. was\r\nrequested to preach. Though only two hours' notice was given, a\r\nrespectable congregation was assembled in the large room of the Lake\r\nHouse; a new hotel then building. Our seats were a few chairs and\r\nbenches, and planks laid on trestles. The preacher stood behind a rough\r\npine-table, on which a large Bible was placed. I was never present at a\r\nmore interesting service; and I know that there were others who felt\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago, we made an excursion into the prairies. Our young\r\nlawyer-friend threw behind him the five hundred dollars per day which he\r\nwas making, and went with us. I thought him wise; for there is that to\r\nbe had in the wilderness which money cannot buy. We drove out of the\r\ntown at ten o'clock in the morning, too late by two hours; but it was\r\nimpossible to overcome the introductions to strangers, and the bustle of\r\nour preparations, any sooner. Our party consisted of seven, besides the\r\ndriver. Our vehicle was a wagon with four horses.\r\n\r\nWe had first to cross the prairie, nine miles wide, on the lake edge of\r\nwhich Chicago stands. This prairie is not usually wet so early in the\r\nyear; but at this time the water stood almost up to the nave of the\r\nwheels: and we crossed it at a walking pace. I saw here, for the first\r\ntime in the United States, the American primrose. It grew in profusion\r\nover the whole prairie, as far as I could see; not so large and fine as\r\nin English greenhouses, but graceful and pretty. I now found the truth\r\nof what I had read about the difficulty of distinguishing distances on a\r\nprairie. The feeling is quite bewildering. A man walking near looks like\r\na Goliath a mile off. I mistook a covered wagon without horses, at a\r\ndistance of fifty yards, for a white house near the horizon: and so on.\r\nWe were not sorry to reach the belt of trees, which bounded the swamp we\r\nhad passed. At a house here, where we stopped to water the horses, and\r\neat dough nuts, we saw a crowd of emigrants; which showed that we had\r\nnot yet reached the bounds of civilisation. A little further on we came\r\nto the river Aux Plaines, spelled on a sign board \"Oplain.\" The ferry\r\nhere is a monopoly, and the public suffers accordingly. There is only\r\none small flat boat for the service of the concourse of people now\r\npouring into the prairies. Though we happened to arrive nearly first of\r\nthe crowd of to-day, we were detained on the bank above an hour; and\r\nthen our horses went over at two crossings, and the wagon and ourselves\r\nat the third. It was a pretty scene, if we had not been in a hurry; the\r\ncountry wagons and teams in the wood by the side of the quiet clear\r\nriver; and the oxen swimming over, yoked, with only their patient faces\r\nvisible above the surface. After crossing, we proceeded briskly till we\r\nreached a single house, where, or nowhere, we were to dine. The kind\r\nhostess bestirred herself to provide us a good dinner of tea, bread,\r\nham, potatoes, and strawberries, of which a whole pailful, ripe and\r\nsweet, had been gathered by the children in the grass round the house,\r\nwithin one hour. While dinner was preparing, we amused ourselves with\r\nlooking over an excellent small collection of books, belonging to Miss\r\nCynthia, the slaughter of the hostess.\r\n\r\nI never saw insulation, (not desolation,) to compare with the situation\r\nof a settler on a wide prairie. A single house in the middle of\r\nSalisbury Plain would be desolate. A single house on a prairie has\r\nclumps of trees near it, rich fields about it; and flowers,\r\nstrawberries, and running water at hand. But when I saw a settler's\r\nchild tripping out of home-bounds, I had a feeling that it would never\r\nget back again. It looked like putting out into Lake Michigan in a\r\ncanoe. The soil round the dwellings is very rich. It makes no dust, it\r\nis so entirely vegetable. It requires merely to be once turned over to\r\nproduce largely; and, at present, it appears to be inexhaustible. As we\r\nproceeded, the scenery became more and more like what all travellers\r\ncompare it to,--a boundless English park. The grass was wilder, the\r\noccasional footpath not so trim, and the single trees less majestic; but\r\nno park ever displayed anything equal to the grouping of the trees\r\nwithin the windings of the blue, brimming river Aux Plaines.\r\n\r\nWe had met with so many delays that we felt doubts about reaching the\r\nplace where we had intended to spend the night. At sunset, we found\r\nourselves still nine miles from Joliet;[11] but we were told that the\r\nroad was good, except a small \"slew\" or two; and there was half a moon\r\nshining behind a thin veil of clouds; so we pushed on. We seemed\r\nlatterly to be travelling on a terrace overlooking a wide champaign,\r\nwhere a dark, waving line might indicate the winding of the river,\r\nbetween its clumpy banks. Our driver descended, and went forward, two or\r\nthree times, to make sure of our road; and at length, we rattled down a\r\nsteep descent, and found ourselves among houses. This was not our\r\nresting-place, however. The Joliet hotel lay on the other side of the\r\nriver. We were directed to a foot-bridge by which we were to pass; and a\r\nford below for the wagon. We strained our eyes in vain for the\r\nfoot-bridge; and our gentlemen peeped and pryed about for some time. All\r\nwas still but the rippling river, and everybody asleep in the houses\r\nthat were scattered about. We ladies were presently summoned to put on\r\nour water-proof shoes, and alight. A man showed himself who had risen\r\nfrom his bed to help us in our need. The foot-bridge consisted, for some\r\nway, of two planks, with a hand-rail on one side: but, when we were\r\nabout a third of the way over, one half of the planks, and the\r\nhand-rail, had disappeared. We actually had to cross the rushing, deep\r\nriver on a line of single planks, by dim moonlight, at past eleven\r\no'clock at night. The great anxiety was about Charley; but between his\r\nfather and the guide, he managed very well. This guide would accept\r\nnothing but thanks. He \"did not calculate to take any pay.\" Then we\r\nwaited some time for the wagon to come up from the ford. I suspected it\r\nhad passed the spot where we stood, and had proceeded to the village,\r\nwhere we saw a twinkling light, now disappearing, and now re-appearing.\r\nIt was so, and the driver came back to look for us, and tell us that the\r\nlight we saw was a signal from the hotel-keeper, whom we found, standing\r\non his door-step, and sheltering his candle with his hand. We sat down\r\nand drank milk in the bar, while he went to consult with his wife what\r\nwas to be done with us, as every bed in the house was occupied. We,\r\nmeanwhile, agreed that the time was now come for us to enjoy an\r\nadventure which we had often anticipated; sleeping in a barn. We had all\r\ndeclared ourselves anxious to sleep in a barn, if we could meet with one\r\nthat was air-tight, and well-supplied with hay. Such a barn was actually\r\non these premises. We were prevented, however, from all practising the\r\nfreak by the prompt hospitality of our hostess. Before we knew what she\r\nwas about, she had risen and dressed herself, put clean sheets on her\r\nown bed, and made up two others on the floor of the same room; so that\r\nthe ladies and Charley were luxuriously accommodated. Two sleepy\r\npersonages crawled down stairs to offer their beds to our gentlemen. Mr.\r\nL. and our Chicago friend, however, persisted in sleeping in the barn.\r\nNext morning, we all gave a very gratifying report of our lodgings. When\r\nwe made our acknowledgments to our hostess, she said she thought that\r\npeople who could go to bed quietly every night ought to be ready to give\r\nup to tired travellers. Whenever she travels, I hope she will be treated\r\nas she treated us. She let us have breakfast as early as half-past five,\r\nthe next morning, and gave Charley a bun at parting, lest he should be\r\ntoo hungry before we could dine.\r\n\r\nThe great object of our expedition, Mount Joliet, was two miles distant\r\nfrom this place. We had to visit it, and perform the journey back to\r\nChicago, forty miles, before night. The mount is only sixty feet high;\r\nyet it commands a view which I shall not attempt to describe, either in\r\nits vastness, or its soft beauty. The very spirit of tranquillity\r\nresides in this paradisy scene. The next painter who would worthily\r\nillustrate Milton's Morning Hymn, should come and paint what he sees\r\nfrom Mount Joliet, on a dewy summer's morning, when a few light clouds\r\nare gently sailing in the sky, and their shadows traversing the prairie.\r\nI thought I had never seen green levels till now; and only among\r\nmountains had I before known the beauty of wandering showers. Mount\r\nJoliet has the appearance of being an artificial mound, its sides are so\r\nuniformly steep, and its form so regular. Its declivity was bristling\r\nwith flowers; among which were conspicuous the scarlet lily, the white\r\nconvolvulus, and a tall, red flower of the scabia form. We disturbed a\r\nnight-hawk, sitting on her eggs, on the ground. She wheeled round and\r\nround over our heads, and, I hope, returned to her eggs before they were\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nNot far from the mount was a log-house, where the rest of the party went\r\nin to dry their feet, after having stood long in the wet grass. I\r\nremained outside, watching the light showers, shifting in the partial\r\nsunlight from clump to level, and from reach to reach of the brimming\r\nand winding river. The nine miles of prairie, which we had traversed in\r\ndim moonlight last night, were now exquisitely beautiful, as the sun\r\nshone fitfully upon them.\r\n\r\nWe saw a prairie wolf, very like a yellow dog, trotting across our path,\r\nthis afternoon. Our hostess of the preceding day, expecting us, had an\r\nexcellent dinner ready for us. We were detained a shorter time at the\r\nferry, and reached the belt of trees at the edge of Nine-mile Prairie,\r\nbefore sunset. Here, in common prudence, we ought to have stopped till\r\nthe next day, even if no other accommodation could be afforded us than a\r\nroof over our heads. We deserved an ague for crossing the swamp after\r\ndark, in an open wagon, at a foot pace. Nobody was aware of this in\r\ntime, and we set forward: the feet of our wearied horses plashing in\r\nwater at every step of the nine miles. There was no road; and we had to\r\ntrust to the instinct of driver and horses to keep us in the right\r\ndirection. I rather think the driver attempted to amuse himself by\r\nexciting our fears. He hinted more than once at the difficulty of\r\nfinding the way; at the improbability that we should reach Chicago\r\nbefore midnight; and at the danger of our wandering about the marsh all\r\nnight, and finding ourselves at the opposite edge of the prairie in the\r\nmorning. Charley was bruised and tired. All the rest were hungry and\r\ncold. It was very dreary. The driver bade us look to our right hand. A\r\nblack bear was trotting alongside of us, at a little distance. After\r\nkeeping up his trot for some time, he turned off from our track. The\r\nsight of him made up for all,--even if ague should follow, which I\r\nverily believed it would. But we escaped all illness. It is remarkable\r\nthat I never saw ague but once. The single case that I met with was in\r\nautumn, at the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\nI had promised Dr. F. a long story about English politics, when a\r\nconvenient opportunity should occur. I thought the present an admirable\r\none; for nobody seemed to have anything to say, and it was highly\r\ndesirable that something should be said. I made my story long enough to\r\nbeguile four miles; by which time, some were too tired, and others too\r\nmuch disheartened, for more conversation. Something white was soon after\r\nvisible. Our driver gave out that it was a house, half a mile from\r\nChicago. But no: it was an emigrant encampment, on a morsel of raised,\r\ndry ground; and again we were uncertain whether we were in the right\r\nroad. Presently, however, the Chicago beacon was visible, shining a\r\nwelcome to us through the dim, misty air. The horses seemed to see it,\r\nfor they quickened their pace; and before half-past ten, we were on the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nThe family, at my temporary home, were gone up to their chambers; but\r\nthe wood-fire was soon replenished, tea made, and the conversation\r\ngrowing lively. My companions were received as readily at their several\r\nresting-places. When we next met, we found ourselves all disposed to\r\nplace warm hospitality very high on the list of virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Detroit, we were most strongly urged to return thither\r\nby the Lakes, instead of by either of the Michigan roads. From place to\r\nplace, in my previous travelling, I had been told of the charms of the\r\nLakes, and especially of the Island of Mackinaw. Every officer's lady\r\nwho has been in garrison there, is eloquent upon the delights of\r\nMackinaw. As our whole party, however, could not spare time to make so\r\nwide a circuit, we had not intended to indulge ourselves with a further\r\nvariation in our travels than to take the upper road back to Detroit;\r\nhaving left it by the lower. On Sunday, June 27th, news arrived at\r\nChicago that this upper road had been rendered impassable by the rains.\r\nA sailing vessel, the only one on the Lakes, and now on her first trip,\r\nwas to leave Chicago for Detroit and Buffalo, the next day. The case was\r\nclear: the party must divide. Those who were obliged to hasten home must\r\nreturn by the road we came: the rest must proceed by water. On Charley's\r\naccount, the change of plan was desirable; as the heats were beginning\r\nto be so oppressive as to render travelling in open wagons unsafe for a\r\nchild. It was painful to break up our party at the extreme point of our\r\njourney; but it was clearly right. So Mr. and Mrs. L. took their chance\r\nby land; and the rest of us went on board the Milwaukee, at two o'clock\r\non the afternoon of the 28th.\r\n\r\nMrs. F. and I were the only ladies on board; and there was no\r\nstewardess. The steward was obliging, and the ladies' cabin was clean\r\nand capacious; and we took possession of it with a feeling of comfort.\r\nOur pleasant impressions, however, were not of long duration. The vessel\r\nwas crowded with persons who had come to the land sales at Chicago, and\r\nwere taking their passage back to Milwaukee; a settlement on the western\r\nshore of the lake, about eighty miles from Chicago. Till we should reach\r\nMilwaukee, we could have the ladies' cabin only during a part of the\r\nday. I say a part of the day, because some of the gentry did not leave\r\nour cabin till near nine in the morning; and others chose to come down,\r\nand go to bed, as early as seven in the evening, without troubling\r\nthemselves to give us five minutes' notice, or to wait till we could put\r\nup our needles, or wipe our pens. This ship was the only place in\r\nAmerica where I saw a prevalence of bad manners. It was the place of all\r\nothers to select for the study of such; and no reasonable person would\r\nlook for anything better among land-speculators, and settlers in regions\r\nso new as to be almost without women. None of us had ever before seen,\r\nin America, a disregard of women. The swearing was incessant; and the\r\nspitting such as to amaze my American companions as much as myself.\r\n\r\nSupper was announced presently after we had sailed; and when we came to\r\nthe table, it was full, and no one offered to stir, to make room for\r\nus. The captain, who was very careful of our comfort, arranged that we\r\nshould be better served henceforth; and no difficulty afterwards\r\noccurred. At dinner, the next day, we had a specimen of how such\r\npersonages as we had on board are managed on an emergency. The captain\r\ngave notice, from the head of the table, that he did not choose our\r\nparty to be intruded on in the cabin; and that any one who did not\r\nbehave with civility at table should be turned out. He spoke with\r\ndecision and good-humour; and the effect was remarkable. Everything on\r\nthe table was handed to us; and no more of the gentry came down into our\r\ncabin to smoke, or throw themselves on the cushions to sleep, while we\r\nsat at work.\r\n\r\nOur fare was what might be expected on Lake Michigan. Salt beef and\r\npork, and sea-biscuit; tea without milk, bread, and potatoes. Charley\r\nthrove upon potatoes and bread: and we all had the best results of\r\nfood,--health and strength.\r\n\r\nA little schooner which left Chicago at the same time with ourselves,\r\nand reached Milwaukee first, was a pretty object. On the 29th, we were\r\nonly twenty-five miles from the settlement; but the wind was so\r\nunfavourable that it was doubtful whether we should reach it that day.\r\nSome of the passengers amused themselves by gaming, down in the hold;\r\nothers by parodying a methodist sermon, and singing a mock hymn. We did\r\nnot get rid of them till noon on the 30th, when we had the pleasure of\r\nseeing our ship disgorge twenty-five into one boat, and two into\r\nanother. The atmosphere was so transparent as to make the whole scene\r\nappear as if viewed through an opera-glass; the still, green waters, the\r\ndark boats with their busy oars, the moving passengers, and the\r\nstruggles of one to recover his hat, which had fallen overboard. We\r\nwere yet five miles from Milwaukee; but we could see the bright, wooded\r\ncoast, with a few white dots of houses.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. F. went on shore, to see what was to be seen, we had the cabin\r\ncleaned out, and took, once more, complete possession of it, for both\r\nday and night. As soon as this was done, seven young women came down the\r\ncompanion-way, seated themselves round the cabin, and began to question\r\nus. They were the total female population of Milwaukee; which settlement\r\nnow contains four hundred souls. We were glad to see these ladies; for\r\nit was natural enough that the seven women should wish to behold two\r\nmore, when such a chance offered. A gentleman of the place, who came on\r\nboard this afternoon, told me that a printing-press had arrived a few\r\nhours before; and that a newspaper would speedily appear. He was kind\r\nenough to forward the first number to me a few weeks afterwards; and I\r\nwas amused to see how pathetic an appeal to the ladies of more\r\nthickly-settled districts it contained; imploring them to cast a\r\nfavourable eye on Milwaukee, and its hundreds of bachelors. Milwaukee\r\nhad been settled since the preceding November. It had good stores, (to\r\njudge by the nature and quality of goods sent ashore from our ship;) it\r\nhad a printing-press and newspaper, before the settlers had had time to\r\nget wives. I heard these new settlements sometimes called \"patriarchal;\"\r\nbut what would the patriarchs have said to such an order of affairs?\r\n\r\nDr. F. returned from the town, with apple-pies, cheese, and ale,\r\nwherewith to vary our ship-diet. With him arrived such a number of\r\ntowns-people, that the steward wanted to turn us out of our cabin once\r\nmore; but we were sturdy, appealed to the captain, and were confirmed in\r\npossession. From this time began the delights of our voyage. The moon,\r\nwith her long train of glory, was magnificent to-night; the vast body of\r\nwaters on which she shone being as calm as if the winds were dead.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of these lakes is, at present, a mystery. They have not\r\nyet been properly surveyed. Our captain had gone to and fro on Lake\r\nHuron, but had never before been on Lake Michigan; and this was rather\r\nan anxious voyage to him. We had got aground on the sand-bar before\r\nMilwaukee harbour; and on the 1st of July, all hands were busy in\r\nunshipping the cargo, to lighten the vessel, instead of carrying her up\r\nto the town. An elegant little schooner was riding at anchor near us;\r\nand we were well amused in admiring her, and in watching the bustle on\r\ndeck, till some New-England youths, and our Milwaukee acquaintance,\r\nbrought us, from the shore, two newspapers, some pebbles, flowers, and a\r\npitcher of fine strawberries.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were off the bar, the vessel hove round, and we cast\r\nanchor in deeper water. Charley was called to see the sailors work the\r\nwindlass, and to have a ride thereon. The sailors were very kind to the\r\nboy. They dressed up their dog for him in sheep-skins and a man's hat; a\r\nsight to make older people than Charley laugh. They took him down into\r\nthe forecastle to show him prints that were pasted up there. They asked\r\nhim to drink rum and water with them: to which Charley answered that he\r\nshould be happy to drink water with them, but had rather not have any\r\nrum. While we were watching the red sunset over the leaden waters,\r\nbetokening a change of weather, the steamer \"New York\" came ploughing\r\nthe bay, three weeks after her time; such is the uncertainty in the\r\nnavigation of these stormy lakes. She got aground on the sand-bank, as\r\nwe had done; and boats were going from her to the shore and back, as\r\nlong as we could see.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was rain and some wind. The captain and steward went\r\noff to make final purchases: but the fresh meat which had been bespoken\r\nfor us had been bought up by somebody else; and no milk was to be had;\r\nonly two cows being visible in all the place. Ale was the only luxury we\r\ncould obtain. When the captain returned, he brought with him a stout\r\ngentleman, one of the proprietors of the vessel, who must have a berth\r\nin our cabin as far as Mackinaw; those elsewhere being too small for\r\nhim. Under the circumstances, we had no right to complain; so we helped\r\nthe steward to partition off a portion of the cabin with a counterpane,\r\nfastened with four forks. This gentleman, Mr. D., was engaged in the fur\r\ntrade at Mackinaw, and had a farm there, to which he kindly invited us.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 3rd, there was much speculation as to whether we should\r\nbe at Mackinaw in time to witness the celebration of the great day. All\r\ndesired it; but I was afraid of missing the Manitou Isles in the dark.\r\nThere was much fog; the wind was nearly fair; the question was whether\r\nit would last. Towards evening, the fog thickened, and the wind\r\nfreshened. The mate would not believe we were in the middle of the lake,\r\nas every one else supposed. He said the fog was too warm not to come\r\nfrom near land. Charley caught something of the spirit of uncertainty,\r\nand came to me in high, joyous excitement, to drag me to the side of the\r\nship, that I might see how fast we cut through the waves, and how\r\nsteadily we leaned over the water, till Charley almost thought he could\r\ntouch it. He burst out about the \"kind of a feeling\" that it was \"not to\r\nsee a bit of land,\" and not to know where we were; and to think \"_if_ we\r\nshould upset!\" and that we never did upset:--it was \"a good and a bad\r\nfeeling at once;\" and he should never be able to tell people at home\r\nwhat it was like. The boy had no fear: he was roused, as the brave man\r\nloves to be. Just as the dim light of the sunset was fading from the\r\nfog, it opened, and disclosed to us, just at hand, the high, sandy shore\r\nof Michigan. It was well that this happened before dark. The captain\r\nhastened up to the mast-head, and reported that we were off Cape Sable,\r\nforty miles from the Manitou Isles.\r\n\r\nThree bats and several butterflies were seen to-day, clinging to the\r\nmainsail,--blown over from the shore. The sailors set their dog at a\r\nbat, of which it was evidently afraid. A flock of pretty pigeons flew\r\nround and over the ship; of which six were shot. Four fell into the\r\nwater; and the other two were reserved for the mate's breakfast; he\r\nbeing an invalid.\r\n\r\nWe were up before five, on the morning of the 4th of July, to see the\r\nManitou Isles, which were then just coming in sight. They are the Sacred\r\nIsles of the Indians, to whom they belong. Manitou is the name of their\r\nGreat Spirit, and of everything sacred. It is said that they believe\r\nthese islands to be the resort of the spirits of the departed. They are\r\ntwo: sandy and precipitous at the south end; and clothed with wood, from\r\nthe crest of the cliffs to the north extremity, which slopes down\r\ngradually to the water. It was a cool, sunny morning, and these dark\r\nislands lay still, and apparently deserted, on the bright green waters.\r\nFar behind, to the south, were two glittering white sails, on the\r\nhorizon. They remained in sight all day, and lessened the feeling of\r\nloneliness which the navigators of these vast lakes cannot but have,\r\nwhile careering among the solemn islands and shores. On our right lay\r\nthe Michigan shore, high and sandy, with the dark eminence, called the\r\nSleeping Bear, conspicuous on the ridge. No land speculators have set\r\nfoot here yet. A few Indian dwellings, with evergreen woods and sandy\r\ncliffs, are all. Just here, Mr. D. pointed out to us a schooner of his\r\nwhich was wrecked, in a snowstorm, the preceding November. She looked\r\npretty and forlorn, lying on her side in that desolate place, seeming a\r\nmere plaything thrown in among the cliffs. \"Ah!\" said her owner, with a\r\nsigh, \"she was a lovely creature, and as stiff as a church.\" Two lives\r\nwere lost. Two young Germans, stout lads, could not comprehend the\r\norders given them to put on all their clothing, and keep themselves\r\nwarm. They only half-dressed themselves: \"the cold took them,\" and they\r\ndied. The rest tried to make fire by friction of wood; but got only\r\nsmoke. Some one found traces of a dog in the snow. These were followed\r\nfor three miles, and ended at an Indian lodge, where the sailors were\r\nwarmed, and kindly treated.\r\n\r\nDuring the bright morning of this day we passed the Fox and Beaver\r\nIslands. The captain was in fine spirits, though there was no longer any\r\nprospect of reaching Mackinaw in time for the festivities of the day.\r\nThis island is chiefly known as a principal station of the great\r\nnorth-western fur trade. Others know it as the seat of an Indian\r\nmission. Others, again, as a frontier garrison. It is known to me as the\r\nwildest and tenderest little piece of beauty that I have yet seen on\r\nGod's earth. It is a small island, nine miles in circumference, being in\r\nthe strait between the Lakes Michigan and Huron, and between the coasts\r\nof Michigan and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the Wisconsin coast came into view, the strait suddenly\r\nnarrowed, and we were about to bid farewell to the great Lake whose\r\ntotal length we had traversed, after sweeping round its southern\r\nextremity. The ugly light-ship, which looked heavy enough, came into\r\nview about six o'clock; the first token of our approach to Mackinaw.\r\nThe office of the light-ship is to tow vessels in the dark through the\r\nstrait. We were too early for this; but perhaps it performed that office\r\nfor the two schooners whose white specks of sails had been on our\r\nsouthern horizon all day. Next we saw a white speck before us; it was\r\nthe barracks of Mackinaw, stretching along the side of its green hills,\r\nand clearly visible before the town came into view.\r\n\r\nThe island looked enchanting as we approached, as I think it always\r\nmust, though we had the advantage of seeing it first steeped in the most\r\ngolden sunshine that ever hallowed lake or shore. The colours were up on\r\nall the little vessels in the harbour. The national flag streamed from\r\nthe garrison. The soldiers thronged the walls of the barracks;\r\nhalf-breed boys were paddling about in their little canoes, in the\r\ntransparent waters; the half-French, half-Indian population of the place\r\nwere all abroad in their best. An Indian lodge was on the shore, and a\r\npicturesque dark group stood beside it. The cows were coming down the\r\nsteep green slopes to the milking. Nothing could be more bright and\r\njoyous.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the old French village are shabby-looking, dusky, and\r\nroofed with bark. There are some neat yellow houses, with red shutters,\r\nwhich have a foreign air, with their porches and flights of steps. The\r\nbetter houses stand on the first of the three terraces which are\r\ndistinctly marked. Behind them are swelling green knolls; before them\r\ngardens sloping down to the narrow slip of white beach, so that the\r\ngrass seems to grow almost into the clear rippling waves. The gardens\r\nwere rich with mountain ash, roses, stocks, currant bushes, springing\r\ncorn, and a great variety of kitchen vegetables. There were two small\r\npiers with little barks alongside, and piles of wood for the\r\nsteam-boats. Some way to the right stood the quadrangle of missionary\r\nbuildings, and the white mission church. Still further to the right was\r\na shrubby precipice down to the lake; and beyond, the blue waters. While\r\nwe were gazing at all this, a pretty schooner sailed into the harbour\r\nafter us, in fine style, sweeping round our bows so suddenly as nearly\r\nto swamp a little fleet of canoes, each with its pair of half-breed\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nWe had been alarmed by a declaration from the captain that he should\r\nstay only three hours at the island. He seemed to have no intention of\r\ntaking us ashore this evening. The dreadful idea occurred to us that we\r\nmight be carried away from this paradise, without having set foot in it.\r\nWe looked at each other in dismay. Mr. D. stood our friend. He had some\r\nfurs on board which were to be landed. He said this should not be done\r\ntill the morning; and he would take care that his people did it with the\r\nutmost possible slowness. He thought he could gain us an additional hour\r\nin this way. Meantime, thunder-clouds were coming up rapidly from the\r\nwest, and the sun was near its setting. After much consultation, and an\r\nassurance having been obtained from the captain that we might command\r\nthe boat at any hour in the morning, we decided that Dr. F. and Charley\r\nshould go ashore, and deliver our letters, and accept any arrangements\r\nthat might be offered for our seeing the best of the scenery in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nScarcely any one was left in the ship but Mrs. F. and myself. We sat on\r\ndeck, and gazed as if this were to be the last use we were ever to have\r\nof our eyes. There was growling thunder now, and the church bell, and\r\nCharley's clear voice from afar: the waters were so still. The Indians\r\nlighted a fire before their lodge; and we saw their shining red forms\r\nas they bent over the blaze. We watched Dr. F. and Charley mounting to\r\nthe garrison; we saw them descend again with the commanding officer, and\r\ngo to the house of the Indian agent. Then we traced them along the\r\nshore, and into the Indian lodge; then to the church; then, the parting\r\nwith the commandant on the shore, and lastly, the passage of the dark\r\nboat to our ship's side. They brought news that the commandant and his\r\nfamily would be on the watch for us before five in the morning, and be\r\nour guides to as much of the island as the captain would allow us time\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nSome pretty purchases of Indian manufactures were brought on board this\r\nevening; light matting of various colours, and small baskets of\r\nbirch-bark, embroidered with porcupine-quills, and filled with maple\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nThe next morning all was bright. At five o'clock we descended the ship's\r\nside, and from the boat could see the commandant and his dog hastening\r\ndown from the garrison to the landing-place. We returned with him up the\r\nhill, through the barrack-yard; and were joined by three members of his\r\nfamily on the velvet green slope behind the garrison. No words can give\r\nan idea of the charms of this morning walk. We wound about in a vast\r\nshrubbery, with ripe strawberries under foot, wild flowers all around,\r\nand scattered knolls and opening vistas tempting curiosity in every\r\ndirection. \"Now run up,\" said the commandant, as we arrived at the foot\r\nof one of these knolls. I did so, and was almost struck backwards by\r\nwhat I saw. Below me was the Natural Bridge of Mackinaw, of which I had\r\nheard frequent mention. It is a limestone arch, about one hundred and\r\nfifty feet high in the centre, with a span of fifty feet; one pillar\r\nresting on a rocky projection in the lake, the other on the hill. We\r\nviewed it from above, so that the horizon line of the lake fell behind\r\nthe bridge, and the blue expanse of waters filled the entire arch. Birch\r\nand ash grew around the bases of the pillars, and shrubbery tufted the\r\nsides, and dangled from the bridge. The soft rich hues in which the\r\nwhole was dressed seemed borrowed from the autumn sky.\r\n\r\nBut even this scene was nothing to one we saw from the fort, on the\r\ncrown of the island; old Fort Holmes, called Fort George when in the\r\npossession of the British. I can compare it to nothing but to what Noah\r\nmight have seen, the first bright morning after the deluge. Such a\r\ncluster of little paradises rising out of such a congregation of waters,\r\nI can hardly fancy to have been seen elsewhere. The capacity of the\r\nhuman eye seems here suddenly enlarged, as if it could see to the verge\r\nof the watery creation. Blue, level waters appear to expand for\r\nthousands of miles in every direction; wholly unlike any aspect of the\r\nsea. Cloud shadows, and specks of white vessels, at rare intervals,\r\nalone diversify it. Bowery islands rise out of it; bowery promontories\r\nstretch down into it; while at one's feet lies the melting beauty which\r\none almost fears will vanish in its softness before one's eyes; the\r\nbeauty of the shadowy dells and sunny mounds, with browsing cattle, and\r\nspringing fruit and flowers. Thus, and no otherwise, would I fain think\r\ndid the world emerge from the flood. I was never before so unwilling to\r\nhave objects named. The essential unity of the scene seemed to be marred\r\nby any distinction of its parts. But this feeling, to me new, did not\r\nalter the state of the case; that it was Lake Huron that we saw\r\nstretching to the eastward; Lake Michigan opening to the west; the\r\nisland of Bois Blanc, green to the brink in front; and Round Island and\r\nothers interspersed. I stood now at the confluence of those great\r\nnorthern lakes, the very names of which awed my childhood; calling up,\r\nas they did, images of the fearful red man of the deep pine-forest, and\r\nthe music of the moaning winds, imprisoned beneath the ice of winter.\r\nHow different from the scene, as actually beheld, dressed in verdure,\r\nflowers, and the sunshine of a summer's morning!\r\n\r\nIt was breakfast-time when we descended to the barracks; and we\r\ndespatched a messenger to the captain to know whether we might breakfast\r\nwith the commandant. We sat in the piazza, and overlooked the village,\r\nthe harbour, the straits, and the white beach, where there were now four\r\nIndian lodges. The island is so healthy that, according to the\r\ncommandant, people who want to die must go somewhere else. I saw only\r\nthree tombstones in the cemetery. The commandant has lost but one man\r\nsince he has been stationed at Mackinaw; and that was by drowning. I\r\nasked about the climate; the answer was, \"We have nine months winter,\r\nand three months cold weather.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been a pity to have missed the breakfast at the garrison,\r\nwhich afforded a strong contrast with any we had seen for a week. We\r\nconcealed, as well as we could, our glee at the appearance of the rich\r\ncream, the new bread and butter, fresh lake trout, and pile of\r\nsnow-white eggs.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that the mission is the least satisfactory part\r\nof the establishment on this island. A great latitude of imagination or\r\nrepresentation is usually admitted on the subject of missions to the\r\nheathen. The reporters of this one appear to be peculiarly imaginative.\r\nI fear that the common process has here been gone through of attempting\r\nto take from the savage the venerable and the true which he possessed,\r\nand to force upon him something else which is to him neither venerable\r\nnor true.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have been proved, by the success of the French among them,\r\nto be capable of civilisation. Near Little Traverse, in the north-west\r\npart of Michigan, within easy reach of Mackinaw, there is an Indian\r\nvillage, full of orderly and industrious inhabitants, employed chiefly\r\nin agriculture. The English and Americans have never succeeded with the\r\naborigines so well as the French; and it may be doubted whether the\r\nclergy have been a much greater blessing to them than the traders.\r\n\r\nIt was with great regret that we parted with the commandant and his\r\nlarge young family, and stepped into the boat to return to the ship. The\r\ncaptain looked a little grave upon the delay which all his passengers\r\nhad helped to achieve. We sailed about nine. We were in great delight at\r\nhaving seen Mackinaw, at having the possession of its singular imagery\r\nfor life: but this delight was at present dashed with the sorrow of\r\nleaving it. I could not have believed how deeply it is possible to\r\nregret a place, after so brief an acquaintance with it. We watched the\r\nisland as we rapidly receded, trying to catch the aspect of it which had\r\ngiven it its name--the Great Turtle. Its flag first vanished: then its\r\ngreen terraces and slopes, its white barracks, and dark promontories\r\nfaded, till the whole disappeared behind a headland and light-house of\r\nthe Michigan shore.\r\n\r\nLake Huron was squally, as usual. Little remarkable happened while we\r\ntraversed it. We enjoyed the lake trout. We occasionally saw the faint\r\noutline of the Manitouline Islands and Canada. We saw a sunset which\r\nlooked very like the general conflagration having begun: the whole\r\nwestern sky and water being as if of red flame and molten lead. This was\r\nsucceeded by paler fires. A yellow planet sank into the heaving waters\r\nto the south; and the northern lights opened like a silver wheat-sheaf,\r\nand spread themselves half over the sky. It is luxury to sail on Lake\r\nHuron, and watch the northern lights.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th we were only twenty miles from the river St. Clair: but the\r\nwind was \"right ahead,\" and we did not reach the mouth of the river till\r\nthe evening of the 8th. The approach and entrance kept us all in a state\r\nof high excitement, from the captain down to Charley. On the afternoon\r\nof the 8th, Fort Gratiot and the narrow mouth of the St. Clair, became\r\nvisible. Our scope for tacking grew narrower, every turn. The captain\r\ndid not come to dinner; he kept the lead going incessantly. Two vessels\r\nwere trying with us for the mouth of the river. The American schooner\r\ngot in first, from being the smallest. The British vessel and ours\r\ncontested the point stoutly for a long while, sweeping round and\r\ncrossing each other, much as if they were dancing a minuet. A squall\r\ncame, and broke one of our chains, and our rival beat us. In the midst\r\nof the struggle, we could not but observe that the sky was black as\r\nnight to windward; and that the captain cast momentary glances thither,\r\nas if calculating how soon he must make all tight for the storm. The\r\nBritish vessel was seen to have come to an anchor. Our sails were all\r\ntaken in, our anchor dropped, and a grim, silence prevailed. The waters\r\nwere flat as ice about the ship. The next moment, the sky-organ began to\r\nblow in our rigging. Fort Gratiot was blotted out; then the woods; then\r\nthe other ship; then came the orderly march of the rain over the\r\nmyrtle-green waters; then the storm seized us. We could scarcely see\r\neach others' faces, except for the lightning; the ship groaned, and\r\ndragged her anchor, so that a second was dropped.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes, the sun gilded the fort, the woods, and the green,\r\nprairie-like, Canada shore. On the verge of this prairie, under the\r\nshelter of the forest, an immense herd of wild horses were seen\r\nscampering, and whisking their long tails. A cloud of pigeons, in\r\ncountless thousands, was shadowing alternately the forests, the lake,\r\nand the prairie; and an extensive encampment of wild Indians was\r\nrevealed on the Michigan shore. It was a dark curtain lifted up on a\r\nscene of wild and singular beauty.\r\n\r\nThen we went to the anxious work of tacking again. We seemed to be\r\nrunning aground on either shore, as we approached each. Our motions were\r\nwatched by several gazers. On the Canada side, there were men on the\r\nsands, and in a canoe, with a sail which looked twice as big as the\r\nbark. The keepers of the Gratiot light-house looked out from the\r\nlantern. A party of squaws, in the Indian encampment, seated on the\r\nsands, stopped their work of cleaning fish, to see how we got through\r\nthe rapids. A majestic personage, his arms folded in his blanket, stood\r\non an eminence in the midst of the camp; and behind him, on the brow of\r\nthe hill, were groups of unclothed boys and men, looking so demon-like,\r\nas even in that scene to remind me of the great staircase in the ballet\r\nof Faust. Our ship twisted round and round in the eddies, as helplessly\r\nas a log, and stuck, at last, with her stem within a stone's throw of\r\nthe Indians. Nothing more could be done that night. We dropped anchor,\r\nand hoped the sailors would have good repose after two days of tacking\r\nto achieve a progress of twenty miles. Two or three of them went ashore,\r\nto try to get milk. While they were gone, a party of settlers stood on\r\nthe high bank, to gaze at us; and we were sorry to see them, even down\r\nto the little children, whisking boughs without ceasing. This was a\r\nthreat of mosquitoes which was not to be mistaken. When the sailors\r\nreturned, they said we were sure to have a good watch kept, for the\r\nmosquitoes would let no one sleep. We tried to shut up our cabin from\r\nthem; but they were already there: and I, for one, was answerable for\r\nmany murders before I closed my eyes. In the twilight, I observed\r\nsomething stirring on the high bank; and on looking closely, saw a party\r\nof Indians, stepping along, in single file, under the shadow of the\r\nwood. Their simplest acts are characteristic; and, in their wild state,\r\nI never saw them without thinking of ghosts or demons.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, I found we were floating down the current, stern\r\nforemost, frequently swinging round in the eddies, so as to touch the\r\none shore or the other. There seemed to be no intermission of settlers'\r\nhouses; all at regular distances along the bank. The reason of this\r\nappearance is a good old French arrangement, by which the land is\r\ndivided into long, narrow strips, that each lot may have a water\r\nfrontage. We were evidently returning to a well-settled country. The\r\nmore comfortable houses on the Canada side were surrounded by spacious\r\nand thriving fields: the poorer by dreary enclosures of swamp. We saw a\r\ngood garden, with a white paling. Cows were being milked. Cow-bells, and\r\nthe merry voices of singing children, were heard from under the clumps;\r\nand piles of wood for the steam-boats, and large stocks of shingles for\r\nroofing were laid up on either hand. The Gratiot steamer puffed away\r\nunder the Michigan bank. Canoes shot across in a streak of light; and a\r\nschooner came down the clear river, as if on the wing between the sky\r\nand the water. I watched two horsemen on the shore, for many miles,\r\ntracing the bay pony and the white horse through the woody screen, and\r\nover the brooks, and along the rickety bridges. I could see that they\r\nwere constantly chatting, and that they stopped to exchange salutations\r\nwith every one they met or overtook. These, to be sure, were few enough.\r\nI was quite sorry when the twilight drew on, and hid them from me. I saw\r\na little boy on a log, with a paddle, pushing himself off from a bank of\r\nwild roses, and making his way in the sunshine, up the river. It looked\r\nvery pretty, and very unsafe; but I dare say he knew best. The captain\r\nand mate were both ill to-day. The boat was sent ashore for what could\r\nbe had. The men made haste, and rowed bravely; but we were carried down\r\nfour miles before we could \"heave to,\" for them to overtake us. They\r\nbrought brandy for the captain; and for us, butter just out of the\r\nchurn. The mosquitoes again drove us from the deck, soon after dark.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 10th, the deck was in great confusion. The captain\r\nwas worse: the mate was too ill to command; and the second mate seemed\r\nto be more efficient in swearing, and getting the men to swear, than at\r\nanything else. After breakfast, there was a search made after a\r\npilferer, who had abstracted certain small articles from our cabin;\r\namong which was Charley's maple-sugar basket, which had been seen in the\r\nwheel-house, with a tea-spoon in it. This seemed to point out one of the\r\njuniors in the forecastle as the offender; the steward, however, offered\r\nto clear himself by taking an oath, \"on a bible as big as the ship,\"\r\nthat he knew nothing of the matter. As we did not happen to have such a\r\nbible on board, we could not avail ourselves of his offer. A comb and\r\ntooth-brush, which had been missing, were found, restored to their\r\nproper places: but Charley's pretty basket was seen no more.\r\n\r\nIt was a comfortless day. We seemed within easy reach of Detroit; but\r\nthe little wind we had was dead ahead; the sun was hot; the mosquitoes\r\nabounded; the captain was downcast, and the passengers cross. There was\r\nsome amusement, however. Dr. F. went ashore, and brought us milk, of\r\nwhich we each had a draught before it turned sour. He saw on shore a\r\nsight which is but too common. An hotel-keeper let an Indian get drunk;\r\nand then made a quarrel between him and another, for selfish purposes.\r\nThe whites seem to have neither honour nor mercy towards the red men.\r\n\r\nA canoe full of Indians,--two men and four children,--came alongside,\r\nthis afternoon, to offer to traffic. They had no clothing but a coarse\r\nshirt each. The smallest child had enormous ear-ornaments of blue and\r\nwhite beads. They were closely packed in their canoe, which rocked with\r\nevery motion. They sold two large baskets for a quarter dollar and two\r\nloaves of bread. Their faces were intelligent, and far from solemn. The\r\nchildren look merry, as children should. I saw others fishing afar off,\r\ntill long after dark. A dusky figure stood, in a splendid attitude, at\r\nthe bow of a canoe, and now paddled with one end of his long lance, now\r\nstruck at a fish with the other. He speared his prey directly through\r\nthe middle; and succeeded but seldom. At dark, a pine torch was held\r\nover the water; and by its blaze, I could still see something of his\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe groaning of our ship's timbers told us, before we rose, that we were\r\nin rapid motion. The wind was fair; and we were likely to reach Detroit,\r\nforty miles, to dinner. Lake St. Clair, with its placid waters and low\r\nshores, presents nothing to look at. The captain was very ill, and\r\nunable to leave his berth. No one on board knew the channel of the\r\nDetroit river but himself; and, from the time we entered it, the lead\r\nwas kept going. When we were within four miles of Detroit, hungry, hot,\r\ntired of the disordered ship, and thinking of friends, breezes, and a\r\ngood dinner at the city, we went aground,--grinding, grinding, till the\r\nship trembled in every timber. The water was so shallow that one might\r\nhave touched the gravel on either side with a walking-stick. There was\r\nno hope of our being got off speedily. The cook applied himself to\r\nchopping wood, in order to lighting a fire, in order to baking some\r\nbread, in order to give us something to eat; for not a scrap of meat, or\r\nan ounce of biscuit, was left on board.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that our party might reach the city, either by paying\r\nhigh for one of the ship's boats, or by getting the mate to hail one of\r\nthe schooners that were in the river. The boats could not be spared. The\r\nmate hoisted a signal for a schooner; and one came alongside, very fully\r\nladen with shingles. Fifteen of us, passengers, with our luggage, were\r\npiled on the top of the cargo, and sailed gently up to the city. The\r\ncaptain was too ill, and the mate too full of vexation, to bid us\r\nfarewell; and thus we left our poor ship. We were glad, however, to pass\r\nher in the river, the next day, and to find that she had been got off\r\nthe shoal before night.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near, Charley, in all good faith, hung out his little\r\nhandkerchief to show the people of Detroit that we were come back. They\r\ndid not seem to know us, however. \"What!\" cried some men on a raft, to\r\nthe master of our schooner, \"have you been robbing a steam-boat?\" \"No,\"\r\nreplied the master, gravely; \"it is a boat that has gone to the bottom\r\nin the lakes.\" We expected that some stupendous alarm would arise out of\r\nthis. When we reached New York, a fortnight after, we found that our\r\nfriends there had been made uneasy by the news that a steam-boat had\r\nsunk on the Lakes, and that eight hundred passengers were drowned.\r\nCatastrophes grow as fast as other things in America.\r\n\r\nThough our friends did not happen to see Charley's pocket-handkerchief\r\nfrom the river, they were soon about us, congratulating us on having\r\nmade the circuit of the Lakes. It was indeed matter of congratulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now given sketches of some of the most remarkable parts of the\r\ncountry, hoping that a pretty distinct idea might thus be afforded of\r\ntheir primary resources, and of the modes of life of their inhabitants.\r\nI have said nothing of the towns, in this connection; town-life in\r\nAmerica having nothing very peculiar about it, viewed in the way of\r\ngeneral survey. The several departments of industry will now be\r\nparticularly considered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] I know not why I should suppress a name that I honour.\r\n\r\n[9] Isaiah xvi. 3.\r\n\r\n[10] It is possible that this term may not yet be familiar to some of my\r\nEnglish readers. It means summary punishment. The modes now in use among\r\nthose who take the law into their own hands in the United States, are\r\ntarring and feathering, scourging with a cow-hide, banishing, and\r\nhanging. The term owes its derivation to a farmer of the name of Lynch,\r\nliving on the Mississippi, who, in the absence of court and lawyers,\r\nconstituted himself a judge, and ordered summary punishment to be\r\ninflicted on an offender. He little foresaw the national disgrace which\r\nwould arise from the extension of the practice to which he gave his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[11] I preserve the original name, which is that of the first French\r\nmissionary who visited these parts. The place is now commonly called\r\nJuliet; and a settlement near has actually been named Romeo: so that I\r\nfear there is little hope of a restoration of the honourable primitive\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n     \"Plus un peuple nombreux se rapproche, moins le gouvernement peut\r\n     usurper sur le Souverain. L'avantage d'un gouvernement tyrannique\r\n     est donc en ceci, d'agir à grandes distances. A l'aide des points\r\n     d'appui qu'il se donne, sa force augmente au loin, comme celle des\r\n     léviers. Celle du peuple, au contraire, n'agit que concentrée: elle\r\n     s'évapore et se perd en s'étendant, comme l'effet de la poudre\r\n     éparse à terre, et qui ne prend feu que grain à grain. Les pays les\r\n     moins peuplés sont ainsi les plus propres à la tyrannie. Les bêtes\r\n     féroces ne règnent que dans les déserts.\"\r\n\r\n     _Rousseau._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pride and delight of Americans is in their quantity of land. I do\r\nnot remember meeting with one to whom it had occurred that they had too\r\nmuch. Among the many complaints of the minority, this was never one. I\r\nsaw a gentleman strike his fist on the table in an agony at the country\r\nbeing so \"confoundedly prosperous:\" I heard lamentations over the spirit\r\nof speculation; the migration of young men to the back country; the\r\nfluctuating state of society from the incessant movement westwards; the\r\nimmigration of labourers from Europe; and the ignorance of the sparse\r\npopulation. All these grievances I heard perpetually complained of; but\r\nin the same breath I was told in triumph of the rapid sales of land; of\r\nthe glorious additions which had been made by the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana and Florida, and of the probable gain of Texas. Land was\r\nspoken of as the unfailing resource against over manufacture; the great\r\nwealth of the nation; the grand security of every man in it.\r\n\r\nOn this head, the two political parties seem to be more agreed than on\r\nany other. The federalists are the great patrons of commerce; but they\r\nare as proud of the national lands as the broadest of the democrats. The\r\ndemocrats, however, may be regarded as the patrons of agriculture, out\r\nof the slave States. There seems to be a natural relation between the\r\nindependence of property and occupation enjoyed by the agriculturist,\r\nand his watchfulness over State Rights and the political importance of\r\nindividuals. The simplicity of country life, too, appears more congenial\r\nwith the workings of democratic institutions, than the complex\r\narrangements of commerce and manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe possession of land is the aim of all action, generally speaking, and\r\nthe cure for all social evils, among men in the United States. If a man\r\nis disappointed in politics or love, he goes and buys land. If he\r\ndisgraces himself, he betakes himself to a lot in the west. If the\r\ndemand for any article of manufacture slackens, the operatives drop into\r\nthe unsettled lands. If a citizen's neighbours rise above him in the\r\ntowns, he betakes himself where he can be monarch of all he surveys. An\r\nartisan works, that he may die on land of his own. He is frugal, that he\r\nmay enable his son to be a landowner. Farmers' daughters go into\r\nfactories that they may clear off the mortgage from their fathers'\r\nfarms; that they may be independent landowners again. All this is\r\nnatural enough in a country colonised from an old one, where land is so\r\nrestricted in quantity as to be apparently the same thing as wealth. It\r\nis natural enough in a young republic, where independence is of the\r\nhighest political value. It is natural enough in a country where\r\npolitical economy has never been taught by its only effectual\r\npropounder--social adversity. And, finally, it falls out well for the\r\nold world, in prospect of the time when the new world must be its\r\ngranary.\r\n\r\nThe democratic party are fond of saying that the United States are\r\nintended to be an agricultural country. It seems to me that they are\r\nintended to be everything. The Niagara basin, the Mississippi valley,\r\nand the South, will be able to furnish the trading world with\r\nagricultural products for ever,--for aught we can see. But it is clear\r\nthat there are other parts of the country which must have recourse to\r\nmanufactures and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in New England got land, and thought themselves rich.\r\nTheir descendants have gone on to do the same; and they now find\r\nthemselves poor. With the exception of some Southerners, ruined by\r\nslavery, who cannot live within their incomes, I met with no class in\r\nthe United States so anxious about the means of living as the farmers of\r\nNew England. In the seventeenth century, curious purchases of land were\r\nmade, and the fathers were wealthy. In those days, a certain farmer\r\nDexter bought the promontory of Nahant, which stretches out into\r\nMassachusetts Bay, of Black Willey, an Indian chief, for a suit of\r\nclothes; the part of the promontory called Great Nahant measuring a mile\r\nand a half in circuit. Others, who held land in similar or larger\r\nquantities, divided it equally among their children, whose portions had\r\nnot been subdivided below the point of comfort, when the great west on\r\nthe one hand, and the commerce of the seas on the other, opened new\r\nresources. From this time, the consolidation of estates has gone on,\r\nnearly as fast as the previous division. The members of a family\r\ndispose of their portions of land to one, and go to seek better fortunes\r\nelsewhere than the rocky soil of New England can afford. Still, while\r\nthe population of Massachusetts is scarcely above half that of London,\r\nits number of landowners is greater than that of all England.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts farmers were the first to decline; but now the\r\ncomparative adversity of agriculture has extended even into Vermont. A\r\nfew years ago, lenders of money into Vermont received thirty per cent.\r\ninterest from farmers: now they are glad to get six per cent.; and this\r\ndoes not arise from the farmers having saved capital of their own. They\r\nhave but little property besides their land. Their daughters, and even\r\ntheir sons, resort to domestic service in Boston for a living. Boston\r\nused to be supplied from Vermont with fowls, butter, and eggs: but the\r\nsupply has nearly ceased. This is partly owing to an increased attention\r\nto the growth of wool for the manufacturers; but partly also to the\r\ndecrease of capital and enterprise among the farmers.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the farmers have so little property besides their land,\r\nthat they are obliged to mortgage when they want to settle a son or\r\ndaughter, or make up for a deficient crop. The great Insurance Company\r\nat Boston is the formidable creditor to many. This Company will not wait\r\na day for the interest. If it is not ready, loss or ruin ensues. Many\r\ncircumstances are now unfavourable to the old-fashioned Massachusetts\r\nfarmer. Domestic manufactures, which used to employ the daughters, are\r\nno longer worth while, in the presence of the factories. The young men,\r\nwho should be the daughters' husbands, go off to the west. The idea of\r\ndomestic service is not liked. There is an expensive family at home,\r\nwithout sufficient employment; and they may be considered poor. These\r\nare evils which may be shaken off any day. I speak of them, not as\r\ndemanding much compassion, but as indicating a change in the state of\r\naffairs; and especially that New England is designed to be a\r\nmanufacturing and commercial region. It is already common to see\r\nagriculture joined with other employments. The farmers of the coast are,\r\nnaturally, fishermen also. They bring home fish, manure their land with\r\nthe offal; sow their seed, and go out again to fish while it is growing.\r\nShoemaking is now joined with farming. In the long winter evenings, all\r\nthe farmers' families around Lynn are busy shoe-making; and in the\r\nspring, they turn out into the fields again. The largest proportion of\r\nfactory girls too is furnished by country families.\r\n\r\nThe traveller may see, by merely passing through the country, without\r\nasking information, how far New England ought to be an agricultural\r\ncountry, if the object of its society be to secure the comfort of its\r\nmembers, rather than the continuance of old customs. The valleys, like\r\nthat of the Connecticut river, whose soil is kept rich by annual\r\ninundations, and whose fields have no fences, gladden the eye of the\r\nobserver. So it is with particular spots elsewhere, where, it may be\r\nremarked, the fences are of the ordinary, slovenly kind, and too much\r\ncare does not seem to have been bestowed on the arrangements and economy\r\nof the estate. Elsewhere, may be seen stony fields, plots of the\r\ngreenest pasture, with grey rocks standing up in the midst, and barberry\r\nbushes sprinkled all about: trim orchards, and fences on which a great\r\ndeal of spare time must have been bestowed. Instead of the ugly, hasty\r\nsnake-fence, there is a neatly built wall, composed of the stones which\r\nhad strewed the fields: sometimes the neatest fence of all; a wall of\r\nstones and sods, regularly laid, with a single rail along the top:\r\nsometimes a singular fence, which would be perfect, but for the expense\r\nof labour required; roots of trees, washed from the soil, and turned\r\nside upwards, presenting a complete chevaux-de-frise, needing no\r\nmending, and lasting the \"for ever\" of this world. About these\r\nfarm-houses, a profusion of mignonette may be seen; and in the season,\r\nthe rich major convolvulus, or scarlet runners, climbing up to the\r\nhigher windows. The dove-cotes are well looked to. There has evidently\r\nbeen time and thought for everything. This is all very pretty to look\r\nat,--even bewitching to those who do not see beneath the surface, nor\r\nknow that hearts may be aching within doors about perilous mortgages,\r\nand the fate of single daughters; but, it being known that such worldly\r\nanxieties do exist, it is not difficult to perceive that these are the\r\nplaces in which they abide.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a knowledge of the difficulty on the spot; but not\r\nalways a clear view of coming events, which include a remedy. The\r\ncommonest way of venting any painful sensibility on the subject, is\r\ndeclamation against luxury; or rather, against the desire for it in\r\nthose who are supposed unable to afford it. This will do no good. If the\r\nPilgrim Fathers themselves had had luxury before their eyes, they would\r\nhave desired to have it; and they would have been right. Luxury is, in\r\nitself, a great good. Luxury is _delicious fare_,--of any and every\r\nkind: and He who bestowed it meant all men to have it. The evil of\r\nluxury is in its restriction; in its being made a cause of separation\r\nbetween men, and a means of encroachment by some on the rights of\r\nothers. Frugality is a virtue only when it is required by justice and\r\ncharity. Luxury is vicious only when it is obtained by injustice, and\r\ncarried on into intemperance. It is a bad thing that a Massachusetts\r\nfarmer should mortgage his farm, in order that his wife and daughters\r\nmay dress like the ladies of Boston; but the evil is not in the dress;\r\nit is rather in his clinging to a mode of life which does not enable him\r\nto pay his debts. The women desire dress, not only because it is\r\nbecoming, but because they revolt from sinking, even outwardly, into a\r\nlower station of life than they once held: and this is more than\r\nharmless; it is honourable. What they have to do is to make up their\r\nminds to be consistent. They must either go down with their farm, for\r\nlove of it, and the ways which belong to it: or they must make a better\r\nliving in some other manner. They cannot have the old farm and its ways,\r\nand luxury too. Nobody has a right to decide for them which they ought\r\nto choose; and declaiming against luxury will therefore do no good. It\r\nis, however, pretty clear which they will choose, while luxury and\r\nmanufactures are growing before their eyes; and, in that case,\r\ndeclaiming against luxury can do little but harm: it will only destroy\r\nsympathy between the declaimers and those who may find the cap fit.\r\n\r\nOne benevolent lady strongly desires and advises that manufactures\r\nshould be put down; and the increased population all sent away\r\nsomewhere, that New England may be as primitive and sparsely peopled as\r\nin days when it was, as she supposes, more virtuous than now. Whenever\r\nshe can make out what virtue is, so as to prove that New England was\r\never more virtuous than now, her plans may find hearers; but not till\r\nthen. I mention these things merely to show how confirmed is the\r\ntendency of New England to manufactures, in preference to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere is one certain test of the permanent fitness of any district of\r\ncountry for agricultural purposes; the settlement of any large number of\r\nGermans in it. The Germans give any price for good land, and use it\r\nall. They are much smiled at by the vivacious and enterprising Americans\r\nfor their plodding, their attachment to their own methods, and the odd\r\ndirection taken by their pride.[12] The part of Pennsylvania where they\r\nabound is called the Boeotia of America. There is a story current\r\nagainst them that they were seen to parade with a banner, on which was\r\ninscribed \"No schools,\" when the State legislature was about\r\nestablishing a school system. On the other hand, it is certain that they\r\nhave good German newspapers prepared among themselves: that their\r\npolitics do them high honour, considering the very short political\r\neducation they have had: and that they know more of political economy\r\nthan their native neighbours. They show by their votes that they\r\nunderstand the tariff and bank questions; and they are staunch\r\nsupporters of democratic principles.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more thriving than the settlements of Germans, when they\r\nhave once been brought into order. Their fields are well fenced; their\r\nimplements of the most substantial make; and their barns a real\r\ncuriosity. While the family of the farmer is living in a poor log-house,\r\nor a shabby, unpainted frame-house, the barn has all the pains of its\r\nowner lavished upon it. I saw several, freshly painted with red, with\r\neleven glass windows, with venetian blinds, at each end, and twelve in\r\nfront. They keep up the profitable customs of their country. The German\r\nwomen are the only women seen in the fields and gardens in America,\r\nexcept a very few Dutch, and the slaves in the south. The stores of\r\npumpkins, apples, and onions in the stoup (piazza) are edifying to\r\nbehold. Under them sits the old dame of the house, spinning at her large\r\nwheel; and her grand-children, all in grey homespun, look as busy as\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe German settlers always contrive to have a market, either by placing\r\nthemselves near one, or bestirring themselves to make one. They have no\r\nidea of sitting down in a wilderness, and growing wild in it. A great\r\nmany of them are market-gardeners near the towns.[13]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to foresee, with distinctness, the destination\r\nof the southern States, east of the Alleghanies, when the curse of\r\nslavery shall be removed. Up to that period, continual deterioration is\r\nunavoidable. Efforts are being made to compensate for the decline of\r\nagriculture by pushing the interests of commerce. This is well; for the\r\n\"opening\" of every new rail-road, of every new pier, is another blow\r\ngiven to slavery. The agriculture of Virginia continues to decline; and\r\nher revenue is chiefly derived from the rearing of slaves as stock for\r\nthe southern market. In the north and west parts of this State, where\r\nthere is more farming than planting, it has long been found that slavery\r\nis ruinous; and when I passed through, in the summer of 1835, I saw\r\nscarcely any but whites, for some hundreds of miles along the road,\r\nexcept where a slave trader was carrying down to the south the remains\r\nthat he had bought up. Unless some new resource is introduced, Virginia\r\nwill be almost impoverished when the traffic in slaves comes to an end;\r\nwhich, I have a strong persuasion, will be the case before very long.\r\nThe Virginians themselves are, it seems, aware of their case. I saw a\r\nfactory at Richmond, worked by black labour, which was found, to the\r\nsurprise of those who tried the experiment, to be of very good quality.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the south, low and shoaly, are unfavourable to foreign\r\ncommerce. The want of a sufficiency of good harbours will probably impel\r\nthe inhabitants of the southern States to renew their agricultural\r\npursuits, and merely confine themselves to internal commerce. The\r\ndepression of agriculture is only temporary, I believe. It began from\r\nslavery, and is aggravated by the opening of the rich virgin soils of\r\nthe south-west. But the time will come when improved methods of tillage,\r\nwith the advantage of free labour, will renew the prosperity of\r\nVirginia, and North and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNo mismanagement short of employing slaves will account for the\r\ndeterioration of the agricultural wealth of these States. When the\r\ntraveller observes the quality of some of the land now under\r\ncultivation, he wonders how other estates could have been rendered so\r\nunprofitable as they are. The rich Congaree bottoms, in South Carolina,\r\nlook inexhaustible; but some estates, once as fine, now lie barren and\r\ndeserted. I went over a plantation, near Columbia, South Carolina, where\r\nthere were four thousand acres within one fence, each acre worth fifteen\r\nhundred dollars. This land has been cropped yearly with cotton since\r\n1794, and is now becoming less productive; but it is still very fine.\r\nThe cotton seed is occasionally returned to the soil; and this is the\r\nonly means of renovation used. Four hundred negroes work this estate. We\r\nsaw the field trenched, ready for sowing. The sowing is done by hand,\r\nthick, and afterwards thinned. I saw the cotton elsewhere, growing like\r\ntwigs. I saw also some in pod. There are three or four pickings of pods\r\nin a season; of which the first gathering is the best. Each estate has\r\nits cotton press. In the gin, the seed is separated from the cotton; and\r\nthe latter is pressed and packed for sale.\r\n\r\nThere seems nothing to prevent the continuance or renovation of the\r\ngrowth of this product, under more favourable circumstances. Whether the\r\nrice swamps will have to be given up, or whether they may be tilled by\r\nfree black labour, remains to be seen. The Chinese grow rice; and so do\r\nthe Italians, without the advantage of free black labour. If, in the\r\nworst case, the rice swamps should have to be relinquished, the loss\r\nwould be more than compensated by the improvement which would take place\r\nin the farming districts; land too high for planting. The western,\r\nmountainous parts of these States would thus become the most valuable.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to hear the praises of corn (Indian corn) in the midst of\r\nthe richest cotton, rice, and tobacco districts. The Indian looks with\r\nsilent wonder upon the settler, who becomes visibly a capitalist in nine\r\nmonths, on the same spot where the red man has remained equally poor,\r\nall his life. In February, both are alike bare of all but land, and a\r\nfew utensils. By the end of the next November, the white settler has his\r\nharvest of corn; more valuable to him than gold and silver. It will\r\nprocure him many things which they could not. A man who has corn, may\r\nhave everything. He can sow his land with it; and, for the rest,\r\neverything eats corn, from slave to chick. Yet, in the midst of so much\r\npraise of corn, I found that it cost a dollar a bushel; that every one\r\nwas complaining of the expenses of living; that, so far from mutton\r\nbeing despised, as we have been told, it was much desired, but not to be\r\nhad; and that milk was a great rarity. Two of us, in travelling, asked\r\nfor a draught of milk. We had each a very small tumbler-full, and were\r\ncharged a quarter-dollar. The cultivation of land is as exclusively for\r\nexportable products, as in the West Indies, in the worst days of their\r\nslavery; when food, and even bricks for building, were imported from\r\nEngland. The total absence of wise rural economy, under the present\r\nsystem, opens great hope of future improvement. The forsaken plantations\r\nare not so exhausted of their resources as it is supposed, from their\r\nproducing little cotton, that they must be. The deserted fields may yet\r\nbe seen, some day, again fruitful in cotton, with corn-fields,\r\npasturage, and stock, (not human,) flourishing in appropriate spots.\r\n\r\nAdversity is the best teacher of economy here, as elsewhere. In the\r\nfirst flush of prosperity, when a proprietor sits down on a rich virgin\r\nsoil, and the price of cotton is rising, he buys bacon and corn for his\r\nnegroes, and other provisions for his family, and devotes every rod of\r\nhis land to cotton-growing. I knew of one in Alabama, who, like his\r\nneighbours, paid for his land and the maintenance of his slaves with the\r\nfirst crop, and had a large sum over, wherewith to buy more slaves and\r\nmore land. He paid eight thousand dollars for his land, and all the\r\nexpenses of the establishment, and had, at the end of the season, eleven\r\nthousand dollars in the bank. It was thought, by a wise friend of this\r\ngentleman's, that it was a great injury, instead of benefit to his\r\nfortune, that his labourers were not free. To use this wise man's\r\nexpression, \"it takes two white men to make a black man work;\" and he\r\nwas confident that it was not necessary, on any pretence whatever, to\r\nhave a single slave in Alabama. Where all the other elements of\r\nprosperity exist, as they do in that rich new State, any quality and\r\namount of labour might be obtained, and the permanent prosperity of the\r\ncountry might be secured. If matters go on as they are, Alabama will in\r\ntime follow the course of the south-eastern States, and find her\r\nproduction of cotton declining; and she will have to learn a wiser\r\nhusbandry by vicissitude. But matters will not go on as they are to that\r\npoint. Cotton-growing is advancing rapidly in other parts of the world\r\nwhere there is the advantage of cheap, free labour; and the southern\r\nStates of America will find themselves unable to withstand the\r\ncompetition of rivals whom they now despise, but by the use of free\r\nlabour, and of the improved management which will accompany it. There is\r\nalready a great importation of mules for field work from the higher\r\nwestern States. Who knows but that in time there may be cattle-shows,\r\n(like those of the more prosperous rural districts of the north,) where\r\nthere are now slave markets; or at least agricultural societies, whereby\r\nthe inhabitants may be put in the way of obtaining tender \"sheep's\r\nmeat,\" while cotton may be grown more plentifully than even at present?\r\n\r\nI saw at Charleston the first great overt act of improvement that I am\r\naware of in South Carolina. One step has been taken upwards; and when I\r\nsaw it, I could only wish that the slaves in the neighbourhood could\r\nsee, as clearly as a stranger could, the good it portended to them. It\r\nis nothing more than that an enterprising gentleman has set up a\r\nrice-mill, and that he avails himself to the utmost of its capabilities;\r\nbut this is made much of in that land of small improvement; as it ought\r\nto be. The chaff is used to enrich the soil: and the proprietor has made\r\nlot after lot of bad land very profitable for sale with it, and is thus\r\ngrowing rapidly rich. The sweet flour, which lies between the husk and\r\nthe grain, is used for fattening cattle. The broken rice is sold cheap;\r\nand the rest finds a good market. There are nine persons employed in the\r\nmill, some white and some black; and many more are busy in preparing the\r\nlots of land, and in building on them. Clusters of houses have risen up\r\naround the mill.\r\n\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, present the extreme case of the\r\nfertility of the soil, the prosperity of proprietors, and the woes of\r\nslaves. I found the Virginians spoke with sorrow and contempt of the\r\ntreatment of slaves in North and South Carolina: South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, of the treatment of slaves in the richer States to the west:\r\nand, in these last, I found the case too bad to admit of aggravation. It\r\nwas in these last that the most heart-rending disclosures were made to\r\nme by the ladies, heads of families, of the state of society, and of\r\ntheir own intolerable sufferings in it. As I went further north again, I\r\nfound an improvement. There was less wealth in the hands of individuals,\r\na better economy, more intelligent slaves, and more discussion how to\r\nget rid of slavery. Tennessee is, in some sort, naturally divided on the\r\nquestion. The eastern part of the State is hilly, and fit for farming;\r\nfor which slave labour does not answer. The western part is used for\r\ncotton-planting; and the planters will not yet hear of free labour. The\r\nmagnificent State of Kentucky has no other drawback to its prosperity\r\nthan slavery; and its inhabitants are so far convinced of this that they\r\nwill, no doubt, soon free themselves from it. They cannot look across\r\nthe river, and witness the prosperity of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio,\r\nwithout being aware that, with their own unequalled natural advantages,\r\nthey could not be so backward as they are, from any other cause.\r\n\r\nKentucky is equally adapted for agriculture and commerce. She may have\r\nports on the rivers, along her whole northern and western boundary; and\r\nshe has already roads superior to almost any in the United States. She\r\nis rich in stone, and many other minerals; in mineral waters, and in a\r\nsoil of unsurpassed fertility. The State is more thickly settled than is\r\nevident to the passing traveller; and the effect will appear when more\r\nmarkets, or roads to existing markets, are opened. In one small county\r\nwhich I visited, my host and his brother had farms of fifteen hundred\r\nacres each; and there were two hundred and fifty other farms in the\r\ncounty. Sometimes these farms are divided among the children. More\r\ncommonly, all the sons but one go elsewhere to settle. In this case, the\r\nhomestead is usually left to the youngest son, who is supposed likely to\r\nbe the most attached to the surviving parent.\r\n\r\nThe estates of the two brothers, mentioned above, comprising three\r\nthousand acres, were bought of the Indians for a rifle. We passed a\r\nmorning in surveying the one which is a grazing farm. There is a good\r\nred-brick house for the family: and the slave-quarter is large. Nothing\r\ncan be more beautiful than the aspect of the estate, from the richness\r\nof its vegetation, and the droves of fine cattle that were to be seen\r\neverywhere. I never saw finer cattle. The owner had just refused sixty\r\ndollars apiece for fourteen of them. Fifteen acres of the forest are\r\nleft for shade; and there, and under single oaks in the cleared pasture,\r\nwere herds of horses and mules, and three donkeys; the only ones I saw\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nWe passed an unshaded meadow, where the grass had caught fire every day\r\nat eleven o'clock, the preceding summer. This demonstrates the necessity\r\nof shade.\r\n\r\nWe passed \"a spontaneous rye-field.\" I asked what \"spontaneous\" meant\r\nhere; and found that a fine crop of rye had been cut the year before;\r\nand that the nearly equally fine one now before us had grown up from the\r\ndropped seed.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the thought of the abundance of milk here, after the dearth\r\nwe had suffered in the South. Forty cows are milked for the use of the\r\nfamily and the negroes, and are under the care of seven women. The\r\nproprietor declared to me that he believed his slaves would drive him\r\nmad. Planters, who grow but one product, suffer much less from the\r\nincapacity and perverse will of their negroes: the care of stock is\r\nquite another matter; and for any responsible service, slaves are\r\ntotally unfit.\r\n\r\nInstead of living being cheaper on country estates, from the necessaries\r\nof life being raised on them, it appears to be much more expensive. This\r\nis partly owing to the prevailing pride of having negroes to show. One\r\nfamily, of four persons, of my acquaintance, in South Carolina, whose\r\nstyle of living might be called homely, cannot manage to live for less\r\nthan three thousand dollars a year. They have a carriage and eleven\r\nnegroes. It is cheaper in Kentucky. In the towns, a family may live in\r\ngood style for two thousand five hundred dollars a year; and for no\r\ngreat deal more in the country. A family entered upon a good house, near\r\na town, with one hundred and twenty acres of land, a few years ago, at a\r\nrent of three hundred dollars. They bought house and land, and brought\r\ntheir slaves, and now live, exclusive of rent and hire of servants, for\r\ntwo thousand dollars a year, in greater numbers and much higher style\r\nthan the South Carolina family.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of agriculture in the States north-west of the Ohio are\r\nbrilliant. The stranger who looks upon the fertile prairies of Illinois\r\nand Indiana, and the rich alluvions of Ohio, feels the iniquity of the\r\nEnglish corn laws as strongly as in the alleys of Sheffield and\r\nManchester. The inhuman perverseness of taxing food is there evident in\r\nall its enormity. The world ought never to hear of a want of food,--no\r\none of the inhabitants of its civilised portions ought ever to be\r\nwithout the means of obtaining his fill, while the mighty western valley\r\nsmiles in its fertility. If the aristocracy of England, for whom those\r\nlaws were made, and by whom they are sustained, could be transported to\r\ntravel, in open wagons, the boundless prairies, and the shores of the\r\ngreat rivers which would bring down the produce, they would groan to see\r\nfrom what their petty, selfish interests had shut out the thousands of\r\nhalf-starved labourers at home. If they could not be convinced of the\r\nvery plain truth, of how their own fortunes would be benefited by\r\nallowing the supply and demand of food to take their natural course,\r\nthey would, for the moment, wish their rent-rolls at the bottom of the\r\nsea, rather than that they should stand between the crowd of labourers\r\nand the supply of food which God has offered them. The landlords of\r\nEngland do not go and see the great western valley; but, happily, some\r\nof the labourers of England do. Far off as that valley is, those\r\nlabourers will make themselves heard from thence, by those who have\r\ndriven them there; and will teach the brethren whom they have left\r\nbehind where the blame of their hunger lies. Every British settler who\r\nploughs a furrow in the prairie, helps to plough up the foundations of\r\nthe British Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nThere is a prospect, not very uncertain or remote, of these prairie\r\nlands bringing relief to a yet more suffering class than either English\r\nlabourers or landlords; the sugar-growing slaves of the south. Rumours\r\nof the progress of sugar-making from beet in France have, for some time\r\npast, been interesting many persons in the United States; especially\r\ncapitalists inclined to speculate, and the vigilant friends of the\r\nslave. Information has been obtained, and some trials made. Individuals\r\nhave sown ten acres and upwards each, and manufactured sugar with a\r\nsmall apparatus. The result has been encouraging; and a large\r\nmanufactory was to be opened in Philadelphia on the 1st of November\r\nlast. Two large joint-stock companies have been founded, one in New\r\nJersey and the other in Illinois. Their proceedings have been quickened\r\nby the frosts of several successive seasons, which have so cut off the\r\ncanes in the south, as that it cannot supply one quarter of the domestic\r\nconsumption: whereas it had previously supplied half. Some of the\r\nsouthern newspapers have recommended the substitution of beet for canes.\r\nHowever soon this may be done, the northern sugar planters, with their\r\nfree labour, will surely overpower the south in the competition. This is\r\non the supposition that beet will answer as well as canes; a supposition\r\nwhich will have Bern granted whenever the south begins to grow beet in\r\npreference to canes.\r\n\r\nA heavy blow would be inflicted on slavery by the success of the beet\r\ncompanies. The condition of the cane-growing slaves cannot be made worse\r\nthan it is. I believe that even in the West Indies it has never been so\r\ndreadful as at present in some parts of Louisiana. A planter stated to a\r\nsugar-refiner in New York, that it was found the best economy to _work\r\noff_ the stock of negroes once in seven years.\r\n\r\nThe interest excited by this subject of beet-growing is very strong\r\nthroughout the United States. Some result must ensue which will be an\r\ninstigation to further action. The most important would be the inducing\r\nin the south either the use of free labour in sugar-growing, or the\r\nsurrender of an object so fatal to decent humanity.\r\n\r\nThe prettiest amateur farm I saw was that of the late Dr. Hosack, at\r\nHyde Park, on the Hudson. Dr. Hosack had spared no pains to improve his\r\nstock, and his methods of farming, as well as the beauty of his\r\npleasure-grounds. His merits in the former departments the agricultural\r\nsocieties in England are much better qualified to appreciate than I; and\r\nthey seem to have valued his exertions; to judge by the medals and other\r\nhonourable testimonials from them which he showed to me. As for his\r\npleasure-grounds, little was left for the hand of art to do. The natural\r\nterrace above the river, green, sweeping, and undulating, is\r\nsurpassingly beautiful. Dr. Hosack's good taste led him to leave it\r\nalone, and to spend his pains on the gardens and conservatory behind. Of\r\nall the beautiful country-seats on the Hudson, none can, I think, equal\r\nHyde Park; though many bear a more imposing appearance from the river.\r\n\r\nThough I twice traversed the western part of the State of New York, I\r\ndid not see the celebrated farm of Mr. Wadsworth; the finest, by all\r\naccounts, in the United States. The next best thing to seeing it was\r\nhearing Mr. Wadsworth talk about it,--especially of its hospitable\r\ncapabilities. This only increased my regret at being unable to visit it.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable order of land-owners that I saw in the United States\r\nwas that of the Shakers and the Rappites; both holding all their\r\nproperty in common, and both enforcing celibacy. The interest which\r\nwould be felt by the whole of society in watching the results of a\r\ncommunity of property is utterly destroyed by the presence of the other\r\ndistinction; or rather of the ignorance and superstition of which it is\r\nthe sign.\r\n\r\nThe moral and economical principles of these societies ought to be most\r\ncarefully distinguished by the observer. This being done, I believe it\r\nwill be found that whatever they have peculiarly good among them is\r\nowing to the soundness of their economical principles; whatever they\r\nhave that excites compassion, is owing to the badness of their moral\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nI visited two Shaker communities in Massachusetts. The first was at\r\nHancock, consisting of three hundred persons, in the neighbourhood of\r\nanother at Lebanon, consisting of seven hundred persons. There are\r\nfifteen Shaker establishments or \"families\" in the United States, and\r\ntheir total number is between five and six thousand. There is no\r\nquestion of their entire success, as far as wealth is concerned. A very\r\nmoderate amount of labour has secured to them in perfection all the\r\ncomforts of life that they know how to enjoy, and as much wealth besides\r\nas would command the intellectual luxuries of which they do not dream.\r\nThe earth does not show more flourishing fields, gardens, and orchards,\r\nthan theirs. The houses are spacious, and in all respects\r\nunexceptionable. The finish of every external thing testifies to their\r\nwealth, both of material and leisure. The floor of their place of\r\nworship, (the scene of their peculiar exercises,) the roofs of their\r\nhouses, their stair-carpets, the feet of their chairs, the springs of\r\ntheir gates, and their spitting-boxes,--for even these neat people have\r\nspitting-boxes--show a nicety which is rare in America. Their table fare\r\nis of the very best quality. We had depended on a luncheon among them,\r\nand were rather alarmed at the refusal we met, when we pleaded our long\r\nride and the many hours that we should have to wait for refreshment, if\r\nthey would not furnish us with some. They urged, reasonably enough, that\r\na steady rule was necessary, subject as the community was to visits from\r\nthe company at Lebanon Springs. They did not want to make money by\r\nfurnishing refreshments, and did not desire the trouble. For once,\r\nhowever, they kindly gave way; and we were provided with delicious\r\nbread, molasses, butter, cheese and wine; all homemade, of course. If\r\nhappiness lay in bread and butter, and such things, these people have\r\nattained the _summum bonum_. Their store shows what they can produce for\r\nsale. A great variety of simples, of which they sell large quantities to\r\nLondon; linen-drapery, knitted wares, sieves, baskets, boxes, and\r\nconfectionary; palm and feather fans, pin-cushions, and other such\r\ntrifles; all these may be had in some variety, and of the best quality.\r\nIf such external provision, with a great amount of accumulated wealth\r\nbesides, is the result of co-operation and community of property among\r\nan ignorant, conceited, inert society like this, what might not the same\r\nprinciples of association achieve among a more intelligent set of\r\npeople, stimulated by education, and exhilarated by the enjoyment of all\r\nthe blessings which Providence has placed within the reach of man?\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Shakers is not to be attributed to their celibacy.\r\nThey are receiving a perpetual accession to their numbers from among the\r\n\"world's people,\" and these accessions are usually of the most\r\nunprofitable kind. Widows with large families of young children, are\r\nperpetually joining the community, with the view of obtaining a\r\nplentiful subsistence with very moderate labour. The increase of their\r\nnumbers does not lead to the purchase of more land. They supply their\r\nenlarged wants by the high cultivation of the land they have long\r\npossessed; and the superfluity of capital is so great that it is\r\ndifficult to conceive what will be done with it by a people so nearly\r\ndead to intellectual enjoyments. If there had been no celibacy among\r\nthem, they would probably have been far more wealthy than they are; the\r\nexpenses of living in community being so much less, and the produce of\r\nco-operative labour being so much greater than in a state of division\r\ninto families. The truth of these last positions can be denied by none\r\nwho have witnessed the working of a co-operative system. The problem is\r\nto find the principle by which all shall be induced to labour their\r\nshare. Any such principle being found, the wealth of the community\r\nfollows of course.\r\n\r\nWhether any principle to this effect can be brought to bear upon any\r\nlarge class of society in the old world, is at present the most\r\nimportant dispute, perhaps, that is agitating society. It will never now\r\nrest till it has been made matter of experiment. If a very low principle\r\nhas served the purpose, for a time at least, in the new world, there\r\nseems much ground for expectation that a far higher one may be found to\r\nwork as well in the more complicated case of English society. There is,\r\nat least, every encouragement to try. While there are large classes of\r\npeople here whose condition can hardly be made worse; while the present\r\nsystem (if such it may be called) imposes care on the rich, excessive\r\nanxiety on the middle classes, and desperation on the poor: while the\r\npowerful are thus, as it were, fated to oppress; the strivers after\r\npower to circumvent and counteract; and the powerless to injure, it\r\nseems only reasonable that some section, at least, of this warring\r\npopulation should make trial of the peaceful principles which are\r\nworking successfully elsewhere. The co-operative methods of the Shakers\r\nand Rappites might be tried without any adoption of their spiritual\r\npride and cruel superstition. These are so far from telling against the\r\nsystem, that they prompt the observer to remark how much has been done\r\nin spite of such obstacles.\r\n\r\nThere must be something sound in the principles on which these people\r\ndiffer from the rest of the world, or they would not work at all; but\r\nthe little that is vital is dreadfully encumbered with that which is\r\ndead. Like all religious persuasions from which one differs, that of the\r\nShakers appears more reasonable in conversation, and in their daily\r\nactions, than on paper and at a distance. In actual life, the absurd and\r\npeculiar recedes before the true and universal; but, I own, I have never\r\nwitnessed more visible absurdity than in the way of life of the Shakers.\r\nThe sound part of their principle is the same as that which has\r\nsustained all devotees; and with it is joined a spirit of fellowship\r\nwhich makes them more in the right than the anchorites and friars of\r\nold. This is all. Their spiritual pride, their insane vanity, their\r\nintellectual torpor, their mental grossness, are melancholy to witness.\r\nReading is discouraged among them. Their thoughts are full of the one\r\nsubject of celibacy: with what effect, may be easily imagined. Their\r\nreligious exercises are disgustingly full of it. It cannot be otherwise:\r\nfor they have no other interesting subject of thought beyond their daily\r\nroutine of business; no objects in life, no wants, no hopes, no novelty\r\nof experience whatever. Their life is all dull work and no play.\r\n\r\nThe women, in their frightful costume, close opaque caps, and drab gowns\r\nof the last degree of tightness and scantiness, are nothing short of\r\ndisgusting. They are averse to the open air and exercise; they are\r\npallid and spiritless. They look far more forlorn and unnatural than the\r\nmen. Their soulless stare at us, before their worship began, was almost\r\nas afflicting as that of the lowest order of slaves; and, when they\r\ndanced, they were like so many galvanised corpses. I had been rather\r\nafraid of not being able to keep my countenance during this part of\r\ntheir worship; but there was no temptation to laugh. It was too shocking\r\nfor ridicule. Three men stood up, shouting a monotonous tune, and\r\ndangling their crossed hands, with a pawing motion, to keep time, while\r\nthe rest danced, except some old women and young children, who sat out.\r\nThe men stamped, and the women jerked, with their arms hanging by their\r\nsides; they described perpetually the figure of a square; the men and\r\nboys on one side, the women and girls on the other. There were prayers\r\nbesides, and singing, and a sermon. This last was of a better quality\r\nthan usual, I understood. It was (of all improbable subjects) on\r\nreligious liberty, and contained nothing outrageously uncommon, except\r\nthe proposition that the American revolution had drawn the last of the\r\nteeth of the red dragon.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the children who are carried in by their\r\nwidowed, or indolent, or poor, or superstitious parents, are always\r\nacquiescent in their destination. I saw many a bright face within the\r\nprim cap-border, which bore a prophecy of a return to the world; and two\r\nof the boys stamped so vigorously in the dance, that it was impossible\r\nto imagine their feelings to be very devotional. The story of one often\r\nserves as an index to the hearts of many. I knew of a girl who was\r\ncarried into a Shaker community by her widowed mother, and subjected\r\nearly to its discipline. It was hateful to her. One Sunday, when she\r\nwas, I believe, about sixteen, she feigned illness, to avoid going to\r\nworship. When she believed every one else gone, she jumped out of a low\r\nwindow, and upon the back of a pony which happened to be in the field.\r\nShe rode round and round the enclosure, without saddle or bridle, and\r\nthen re-entered the house. She had been observed, and was duly\r\nreprimanded. She left the community in utter weariness and disgust. A\r\nfriend of mine, in a neighbouring village, took the girl into her\r\nservice. She never settled well in service, being too proud for the\r\noccupation; and she actually went back to the same community, and is\r\nthere still, for no better reason than the saving of her pride. Her old\r\nteachers had, it thus appeared, obtained an influence over her,\r\nnotwithstanding the tyranny of their discipline; and it had not been of\r\na wholesome moral nature. But no more words are necessary to show how\r\npride, and all other selfishness, must flourish in a community which\r\nreligiously banishes all the tenderest charities of life.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Mr. Rapp are settled at Economy, on the Ohio, eighteen\r\nmiles below Pittsburgh. Their number was five hundred when I was there;\r\nand they owned three thousand acres of land. Much of their attention\r\nseems to be given to manufactures. They rear silkworms, and were the\r\nearliest silk-weavers in the United States. At my first visit they were\r\nweaving only a flimsy kind of silk handkerchief; last summer I brought\r\naway a piece of substantial, handsome black satin. They have\r\nsheep-walks, and a large woollen manufactory. Their factory was burnt\r\ndown in 1834; the fire occasioning a loss of sixty thousand dollars; a\r\nmere trifle to this wealthy community. Their vineyards, corn-fields,\r\norchards, and gardens gladden the eye. There is an abundance so much\r\nbeyond their need that it is surprising that they work; except for want\r\nof something else to do. The Dutch love of flowers was visible in the\r\nplants that were to be seen in the windows, and the rich carnations and\r\nother sweets that bloomed in the garden and green-house. The whole place\r\nhas a superior air to that of either of the Shaker \"families\" that I\r\nsaw. The women were better dressed; more lively, less pallid; but, I\r\nfear, not much wiser. Mr. Rapp exercises an unbounded influence over his\r\npeople. They are prevented learning any language but German, and are not\r\nallowed to converse with strangers. The superintendent keeps a close\r\nwatch over them in this respect. Probationers must serve a year before\r\nthey can be admitted: and the managers own that they dread the entrance\r\nof young people, who might be \"unsettled;\" that is, not sufficiently\r\nsubservient.\r\n\r\nI was curious to learn how five hundred persons could be kept in the\r\nnecessary subjection by one. Mr. Rapp's means are such that his task is\r\nnot very difficult. He keeps his people ignorant; and he makes them\r\nvain. He preaches to them their own superiority over the rest of the\r\nworld so incessantly that they fully believe it; and are persuaded that\r\ntheir salvation is in his hands. At first I felt, with regard both to\r\nthem and the Shakers, a strong respect for the self-conquest which could\r\nenable them to endure the singularity,--the one community, of its\r\nnon-intercourse with strangers; the other, of its dancing exhibitions;\r\nbut I soon found that my respect was misplaced. One and all, they glory\r\nin the singularity. They feel no awkwardness in it, from first to last.\r\nThis vanity is the handle by which they are worked.\r\n\r\nMr. Rapp is now very old. His son is dead. It remains to be seen what\r\nwill become of his community, with its immense accumulation of wealth,\r\nwhen it has lost its dictator. It does not appear that they can go on in\r\ntheir present state without a dictator. They smile superciliously upon\r\nMr. Owen's plan, as admitting \"a wrong principle,\"--marriage. The best\r\nhope for them is that they will change their minds on this point,\r\nadmitting the educational improvements which will arise out of the\r\nchange, and remaining in community with regard to property. This is the\r\nprocess now in action among the seceders from their body, settled on the\r\nopposite bank of the river, a short distance below Economy.\r\n\r\nThese seceders were beguiled by Count Leon, a stranger, who told the\r\npeople a great deal that was true about Mr. Rapp, and a great deal that\r\nwas false about himself. It is a great pity that Count Leon was a\r\nswindler; for he certainly opened the eyes of the Economy people to many\r\ntruths, and might have done all that was wanted, if he had himself been\r\nhonest. He drew away seventy of the people, and instigated them to\r\ndemand of Mr. Rapp their share of the accumulated property. It was\r\nrefused: and a suit was instituted against Mr. Rapp, in whose name the\r\nwhole is invested. The lawyers compromised the affair, and Mr. Rapp\r\ndisbursed 120,000 dollars. Count Leon obtained, and absconded with\r\nalmost the whole, and died in Texas; the burial-place of many more such\r\nmen. With the remnant of their funds, the seventy seceders purchased\r\nland, and settled themselves opposite to Beaver, on the Ohio. They live\r\nin community, but abjuring celibacy; and have been joined by some\r\nthorough-bred Americans. It will be seen how they prosper.\r\n\r\nThough the members of these remarkable communities are far from being\r\nthe only agriculturists in whom the functions of proprietor and labourer\r\nare joined, the junction is in them so peculiar as to make them a\r\nseparate class, holding a place between the landowners of whom I have\r\nbefore spoken, and the labourers of whom I shall have to treat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF LAND.\r\n\r\nThe political economists of England have long wondered why the Americans\r\nhave not done what older nations would be glad to do, if the opportunity\r\nhad not gone by;--reserved government lands, which, as it is the\r\ntendency of rent to rise, might obviate any future increase of taxation.\r\nThere are more good reasons than one why this cannot be done in America.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the general government are so small that the present\r\ndifficulty is to reduce the taxation so as to leave no more than a safe\r\nsurplus revenue in the treasury; and there is no prospect of any\r\nincrease of taxation; as the taxpayers are likely to grow much faster\r\nthan the expenses of the government.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States choose to be proprietors of land, not\r\ntenants. No one can yet foresee the time when the relation of landlord\r\nand tenant (except in regard to house property) will be extensively\r\nestablished in America. More than a billion of acres remain to be\r\ndisposed of first.\r\n\r\nThe weightiest reason of all is that, in the United States, the people\r\nof to-day are the government of to-day; the people of fifty years hence\r\nwill be the government of fifty years hence; and it would not suit the\r\npeople of to-day to sequestrate their property for the benefit of their\r\nsuccessors, any better than it would suit the people of fifty years\r\nhence to be legislated for by those of to-day. A democratic government\r\nmust always be left free to be operated upon by the will of the\r\nmajority of the time being. All that the government of the day can do is\r\nto ascertain what now appears to be the best principle by which to\r\nregulate the disposal of land, and then to let the demand and supply\r\ntake their natural course.\r\n\r\nThe methods according to which the disposal of land is carried on are as\r\ngood as the methods of government almost invariably are in America. The\r\ndeficiency is in the knowledge of the relation which land bears to other\r\ncapital and to labour.[14] A few clear-headed men have foreseen the evil\r\nof so great a dispersion of the people as has taken place, and have\r\nconsistently advocated a higher price being set upon land than that at\r\nwhich it is at present sold. Such men are now convinced that evils which\r\nseem to bear no more relation to the price of land than the fall of an\r\napple to the motions of the planets, are attributable to the reduction\r\nin the price of government lots: that much political blundering, and\r\nreligious animosity; much of the illegal violence, and much of the\r\npopular apathy on the slave question, which have disgraced the country,\r\nare owing to the public lands being sold at a minimum price of a dollar\r\nand a-quarter per acre. Many excellent leaders of the democratic party\r\nthink the people at large less fit to govern themselves wisely than they\r\nwere five-and-twenty years ago. This seems to me improbable; but I\r\nbelieve there is no doubt that the dispersion has hitherto been too\r\ngreat; and that the intellectual and moral, and, of course, the\r\npolitical condition of the people has thereby suffered.\r\n\r\nThe price of the public lands was formerly two dollars per acre, with\r\ncredit. It was found to be a bad plan for the constituents of a\r\ngovernment to be its debtors; and there was a reduction of the price to\r\na dollar and a quarter, without credit. In forty years, above forty\r\nmillions of acres have been sold. The government cannot arbitrarily\r\nraise the price. If any check is given to the process of dispersion, it\r\nmust arise from the people perceiving the true state of their own case,\r\nand acting accordingly.\r\n\r\nSome circumstances seem at present to favour the process of\r\nenlightenment; others are adverse to it. Those which are favourable are,\r\nthe high prosperity of manufactures and commerce, the essential\r\nrequisite of which is the concentration of labourers: the increasing\r\nimmigration of labourers from Europe, and the happy experience which\r\nthey force upon the back settler of the advantage of an increased\r\nproportion of labour to land; and the approaching crisis of the slavery\r\nquestion; when every one will see the necessity of measures which will\r\nkeep the slaves where they are. Of the extraordinary, and I must think,\r\noften wilful error of taking for granted that all the slaves must be\r\nremoved, in order to the abolition of slavery, I shall have to speak\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances unfavourable to an understanding of the true state of\r\nthe case about the disposal of land are, the deep-rooted persuasion that\r\nland itself is the most valuable wealth, in all places, and under all\r\ncircumstances: and the complication of interests connected with the late\r\nacquisition of Louisiana and Florida, and the present usurpation of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nLouisiana was obtained from the French, not on account of the fertile\r\nnew land which it comprehended, but because it was essential to the very\r\nexistence of the United States that the mouth of the Mississippi should\r\nnot be in the possession of another people. The Americans obtained the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi; and with it, unfortunately, large tracts of\r\nthe richest virgin soil, on which slavery started into new life, and on\r\nwhich \"the perspiration of the eastern States\" (as I have heard the\r\nsettlers of the west called) rested, and grew barbarous while they grew\r\nrich. A fact has lately transpired in the northern States which was\r\nalready well known in the south,--that the purchase of Florida was\r\neffected for the sake of the slave-holders. It is now known that the\r\nPresident was overwhelmed with letters from slave-owners, complaining\r\nthat Florida was the refuge of their runaways; and demanding that this\r\nretreat should be put within their power. Florida was purchased. Many\r\nand great evils have already arisen out of its acquisition. To cover\r\nthese, and blind the people to the particular and iniquitous interests\r\nengaged in the affair, the sordid faction benefited raises a perpetual\r\nboast in the ears of the people about their gain of new territory, and\r\nthe glory and profit of having added so many square miles to their\r\nalready vast possessions.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of those of the people who do not yet see the whole case,\r\nthe only evil which has arisen out of the possession of Florida, is the\r\nSeminole warfare. They breathe an intense hatred against the Seminole\r\nIndians; and many fine young men have gone down into Florida, and lost\r\ntheir lives in battle, without being aware that they were fighting for\r\noppressors against the oppressed. Probably few of the United States\r\ntroops who fell in the late Seminole war knew how the strife arose.\r\nAccording to the laws of the slave States, the children of the slaves\r\nfollow the fortunes of the _mother_. It will be seen, at a glance, what\r\nconsequences follow from this; how it operates as a premium upon\r\nlicentiousness among white men; how it prevents any but mock marriages\r\namong slaves; and also what effect it must have upon any Indians with\r\nwhom slave women have taken refuge. The late Seminole war arose out of\r\nthis law. The escaped slaves had intermarried with the Indians. The\r\nmasters claimed the children. The Seminole fathers would not deliver\r\nthem up. Force was used to tear the children from their parents' arms,\r\nand the Indians began their desperate, but very natural work of\r\nextermination. They have carried on the war with eminent success, St.\r\nAugustine, the capital, being now the only place in Florida where the\r\nwhites can set their foot. Of course, the poor Indians will ultimately\r\nsuccumb, however long they may maintain the struggle: but, before that,\r\nthe American people may possibly have learned enough of the facts of the\r\ncase to silence those who boast of the acquisition of Florida, as an\r\nincrease of the national glory.\r\n\r\nIt would be a happy thing for them if they should know all soon enough\r\nto direct their national reprobation upon the Texan adventurers, and\r\nwash their hands of the iniquity of that business. This would soon be\r\ndone, if they could look upon the whole affair from a distance, and see\r\nhow the fair fame of their country is compromised by the avarice and\r\ncraft of a faction. The probity of their people, their magnanimity in\r\nmoney matters, have always been conspicuous, from the time of the\r\ncession of their lands by the States to the General Government, till\r\nnow: and, now they seem in danger of forfeiting their high character\r\nthrough the art of the few, and the ignorance of the many. The few are\r\nobtaining their end by flattering the passion of the many for new\r\nterritory, as well as by engaging their best feelings on behalf of those\r\nwho are supposed to be fighting for their rights against oppressors.\r\nThere is yet hope. The knowledge of the real state of the case is\r\nspreading; and, if only time can be gained, the Americans will yet be\r\nsaved from the eternal disgrace of adding Texas to their honourable\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe brief account which I shall give of what is prematurely called the\r\nacquisition of Texas, is grounded partly on historical facts, open to\r\nthe knowledge of all; and partly on what I had the opportunity of\r\nlearning at New Orleans, from some leaders and agents in the Texan\r\ncause, who did what they could to enlist my judgment and sympathies on\r\nbehalf of their party. I went in entire ignorance of the whole matter.\r\nMy first knowledge of it was derived from the persons above-mentioned,\r\nwhose objects were to obtain the good-will of such English as they could\r\nwin over; to have their affairs well spoken of in London; and to get the\r\ntide of respectable English emigration turned in their direction. With\r\nme they did not succeed: with some others they did. Several English are\r\nalready buried in Texas; and there are others whose repentance that they\r\never were beguiled into aiding such a cause will be far worse than\r\ndeath. The more I heard of the case from the lips of its advocates, the\r\nworse I thought of it: and my reprobation of the whole scheme has grown\r\nwith every fact which has come out since.\r\n\r\nTexas, late a province of Mexico, and then one of its confederated\r\nStates, lies adjacent to Louisiana. The old Spanish government seem to\r\nhave had some foresight as to what might happen, to judge by the\r\njealousy with which they guarded this part of their country from\r\nintrusion by the Americans. The Spanish Captain-general of the internal\r\nprovinces, Don Nemisio Salcedo, used to say that he would, if he could,\r\nstop the birds from flying over the boundary between Texas and the\r\nUnited States. Prior to 1820, however, a few adventurers, chiefly Indian\r\ntraders, had dropped over the boundary line and remained unmolested in\r\nthe eastern corner of Texas. In 1820, Moses Austin, of Missouri, was\r\nprivileged by the Spanish authorities to introduce three hundred\r\norderly, industrious families, professing the Catholic religion, as\r\nsettlers into Texas. Moses Austin died; and his son Stephen prosecuted\r\nthe scheme. Before possession of the land was obtained, the Mexican\r\nRevolution occurred; but the new government confirmed the privilege\r\ngranted by the old one, with some modifications. The chief of the\r\nsettlers and his followers were liberally enriched with lands, gratis;\r\non the conditions of their occupying them; of their professing the\r\nCatholic religion; and of their being obedient to the laws of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOther persons were tempted by Austin's success to apply for grants. Many\r\nobtained them, and disposed of their grants to joint stock companies; so\r\nthat Texas became the scene of much land-speculation. The companies\r\nbegan to be busy about \"stock\" and \"scrip,\" which they proffered as\r\npreparatory titles to land; and a crowd of ignorant and credulous\r\npersons, and of gamblers, thus became greedy after lands which no more\r\nbelonged to any Americans than Ireland.\r\n\r\nLeave was given to the actual settlers by the Mexican Government to\r\nintroduce, for ten years, duty free, all articles, not contraband, that\r\nwere necessary for their use and comfort. Under this permission, much\r\nsmuggling went on: and many adventurers settled in Texas for the very\r\npurpose of supplying the neighbouring Indian tribes with contraband\r\narticles. Arms and ammunition were plentifully furnished to the savages;\r\nand slaves to the settlers; though slavery had been abolished in the\r\ncountry, by whose laws the settlers had engaged to live.\r\n\r\nThe next step was, an offer on the part of the United States Government\r\nto purchase Texas, in order to incorporate it with the Union. The offer\r\nwas instantly and indignantly rejected by the Mexicans. It may seem\r\nsurprising that even with the passion for territory that the people of\r\nthe United States have, they should desire to purchase Texas, while\r\nabove a billion of acres of land at home were still unoccupied. Slavery\r\nis found to be the solution of this, as of almost every other absurdity\r\nand unpleasant mystery there. Slavery answers only on a virgin soil, and\r\nunder certain conditions of the supply of labour. It is destined to die\r\nout of the States which it has impoverished, and which come most closely\r\ninto contrast with those which are flourishing under free labour. It is\r\nevidently destined soon to be relinquished by Missouri, Kentucky,\r\nVirginia, Maryland, and Delaware; and not very long afterwards, by the\r\nCarolinas, and perhaps Tennessee. The proprietors of slaves have a\r\ndouble purpose in acquiring new territory: to obtain a fresh field for\r\nthe labour of the slaves they possess; and, (what is at least as\r\nimportant,) to keep up the equality of the representation of the slave\r\nand free States in Congress. We have before seen that there is a\r\nprovision against the introduction of slavery into the lands north-west\r\nof the Ohio. When to the representation of the new States of this\r\nregion, shall be joined that of the old States which relinquish slavery,\r\nthe remaining slave States will be in a hopeless minority in Congress,\r\nunless a representation from new slave regions can be provided. Texas is\r\nto be obtained first; and, if desirable, to be divided into several\r\nStates; and afterwards, the aggressions on the Mexican territory will\r\ndoubtless be repeated, as often as a new area for slave labour is\r\nwanted; and an accession of representation, for the support of slavery,\r\nis needed in Congress. Thus it happens that a host of land-speculators,\r\nadventurers and slave-owners have, for a long series of years, been\r\ninterested in the acquisition of Texas.\r\n\r\nOn the refusal of the Mexican Government to sell Texas, the newspapers\r\nof the slave-holding portion of the United States began to indicate\r\nmethods of obtaining the territory, and to advocate the use of any means\r\nfor so desirable an object. The agent of the United States at the\r\nMexican capital is believed to have been instigated by his government to\r\nintrigue for the purpose which could not be obtained by negotiation. The\r\nsettlers in Texas made it known along the Mississippi that they might\r\nsoon be strong enough to establish slavery openly, in defiance of\r\nMexico. This brought in an accession of slave-holding settlers, who\r\nevaded the Mexican laws, by calling their slaves \"apprentices for\r\nninety-nine years.\" The Mexicans took alarm; decreed in the State\r\nLegislature of Texas that no apprenticeship should, on any pretence, be\r\nfor a longer term than ten years; forbade further immigration from the\r\nUnited States; and sent a small body of troops to enforce the\r\nprohibition. This was in 1829 and 1830.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the Mexican troops were unfortunately wanted near the capital,\r\nand called in from the frontiers and colonies. The settlers shut up the\r\ncustom-houses in their part of the country, and defied the laws as much\r\nas they pleased. Then a great number of restless, bad spirits began to\r\npour into Texas from the whole of the United States; men who had to fly\r\nfrom their creditors, or from the pursuit of justice. There was probably\r\nnever seen a more ferocious company of ruffians than Texas contains at\r\nthis moment. These men, who had nothing to lose, now set to work to\r\nwrench the territory from the hands of the Mexicans. They actually\r\nproceeded, in 1833, to organize a State Government; opposed earnestly\r\nbut feebly by the honest, original settlers, who were satisfied with the\r\ncontract under which they had settled, and had everything to lose by the\r\nbreach of it. A Convention was called, to prepare a State Constitution,\r\nwhich Stephen Austin had the audacity to carry to the Mexican capital,\r\nto pray for its ratification by the Mexican Congress. After some time,\r\nhe was committed to prison on a charge of treasonable conspiracy. He was\r\nstill in prison when I was at New Orleans, in May, 1835; and no one of\r\nthe persons who conversed with me on Texan affairs alluded to the fact.\r\nThey spoke of him as if living and acting among the settlers. He wrote\r\nto the colonists from his prison, advising strict obedience to the\r\nMexican laws; and, finally, gave his promise to the government to\r\npromote order in the colonies; and was dismissed, by the clemency of the\r\nadministration, without further punishment than an imprisonment of\r\nnearly two years.\r\n\r\nThe wilder adventurers among the settlers had chafed at his advice, but\r\nfound it necessary to be quiet for a time. The Mexican government put\r\ntoo much trust in them on this account, and restored, during Austin's\r\nimprisonment, the freedom of immigration, on the old conditions. The\r\nliberty was again shamelessly abused. Slaves were imported _from\r\nAfrica_, via Cuba, and illegal land speculations were carried on with\r\nmore vigour than ever. Troops were again sent from the capital to\r\nre-open the custom-houses, and enforce their regulations. But it was now\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nIt had long been a settled agreement between the Texan adventurers and\r\nmany slave-holders of the south, that if slavery could no otherwise be\r\nperpetuated in Texas, it should be done by the seizure of that province;\r\nall possible aid being given by the residents in the United States, who\r\nwere a party to the agreement. This was avowed by the adventurers in\r\nTexas; and the avowal has been justified by the subscriptions of money,\r\narms, and stores, which have been sent through New Orleans; the\r\ncompanies of volunteers that have given their strength to the bad cause;\r\nand the efforts of members of Congress from the south to hurry on the\r\nrecognition of the independence of Texas by the United States\r\nGovernment. It was with shame and grief that I heard, while I was in New\r\nYork, last spring, of the public meeting there, which had been got up by\r\nmen who should have put the influence of their names to a better use,--a\r\npublic meeting in behalf of the Texan adventurers, where high-sounding\r\ncommon-places had been played off about patriotism, fighting for the\r\ndearest rights of man, and so forth. The purpose was, I believe,\r\nanswered for the time. The price of stock rose; and subscriptions were\r\nobtained. The Texan cause was then in the lowest state of depression. It\r\nsoon revived, in consequence of an unfortunate defeat of the Mexicans,\r\nand the capture of the President of their republic, Santa Anna. This,\r\nagain, was made to serve as the occasion of a public dinner at New York,\r\nwhen some eminent members of Congress were passing through, to the\r\nSprings, in the summer. The time will come when those gentlemen will\r\nlook back upon their speeches at that dinner as among the deeds which,\r\ndying, they would most wish to blot. By this time, however, the true\r\ncharacter of the struggle was beginning to be extensively recognised:\r\nand, day by day, the people of the United States have been since\r\nawakening to the knowledge of how they have been cheated in having their\r\nbest sympathies called forth in behalf of the worst of causes. The great\r\nfear is, lest this should prove to be too late; lest, the United States\r\nhaving furnished the means by which the usurpation of Texas has been\r\nachieved, the people of the Union should be persuaded that they must\r\nfollow their common, and otherwise fair rule, of acknowledging the\r\nindependence of all States that are _de facto_ independent, without\r\nhaving anything to do with the question _de jure_.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the national conduct of the United States on this great\r\nquestion? The government has been very nearly impartial. It must be\r\nallowed that factions and individuals were already doing so much that,\r\nif the government wished all possible success to the Texans, it could\r\nhardly do better than be quiet while they were receiving the aid of its\r\nconstituents. While the theft of Texas has been achieved, (if it be\r\nachieved,) by United States men, money and arms, the general government\r\nhas been officially regarding it as ostensibly and actually a foreign\r\naffair. However much may be true of the general belief in the interest\r\nof its members in the success of the Texan aggression, the government\r\nhas preserved a cool and guarded tone throughout; and the only act that\r\nI know of for which it can be blamed is for not removing General Gaines\r\nfrom his command on the frontier, on his manifestation of partisanship\r\non the Texan side. General Gaines was ordered to protect the settlers on\r\nthe south-western frontier, who might be in danger from the Mexicans,\r\nand from the fierce Indians who were engaged on the Mexican side of the\r\nquarrel. General Gaines wrote to head quarters of his intentions of\r\ncrossing, to attack the Mexicans, not only the inner bounds of the\r\nUnited States territory, but the disputed boundary, claimed by the\r\nUnited States, and disallowed by Mexico. Immediate orders were\r\ndespatched to him to do no such thing; to confine himself, except in a\r\nstrong emergency, to the inner boundary; and on no account whatever to\r\ncross the disputed line. This was not enough. An officer who had shown\r\nhimself so indisposed to the neutrality professed by his government,\r\nshould have been sent where he could indulge his partialities with less\r\nhazard to the national honour.\r\n\r\nSome senators from the south pressed, last session, with indecent haste,\r\nfor the recognition of the independence of Texas. The speech of\r\nEx-President Adams remains as an eternal rebuke to such.[15] This speech\r\nwas the most remarkable individual act of the session; and no session\r\nhas been distinguished by one more honourable. There was no attempt at a\r\nreply to it, in or out of either House. Mr. Adams left no resource to\r\nthe advocates of the Texan cause but abuse of himself: the philosophy of\r\nwhich he, no doubt, understood as well as other people. Various public\r\nmen, in various public assemblies, have declared their desire for the\r\nsuccess of the Texans; and have joined with this the avowal that the\r\nvalue of slaves will rise fifty per cent, as soon as the independence of\r\nTexas is acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe war is not yet over. The vicissitudes have been so great,--each\r\nparty has appeared at times in so hopeless a condition, that the friends\r\nof American honour, and the foes of slavery, do not yet despair of the\r\nultimate expulsion of the aggressors, and the restoration of Texas to\r\nMexico. If these hopes must be surrendered,--if slavery is to be\r\nre-established on a constitutional basis, in a vast territory where it\r\nhad been actually abolished,--if a new impulse is thus to be given to\r\nthe traffic in native Africans,[16]--if the fair fame of the\r\nAnglo-Americans is to be thus early, and thus deeply stained, good men\r\nmust rouse themselves the more to enlighten the ignorance through which\r\nthe misfortune has happened. They must labour to exhibit the truth,\r\nkeeping unshaken their faith in the theory of their constitution that\r\n\"the majority will be in the right.\"\r\n\r\nIt is much to be feared that, even if Texas were acknowledged to-morrow\r\nto be a Mexican State, an injury would be found to have been done to the\r\nAmerican people, which it will take a long time and much experience to\r\nrepair. No pains have been spared to confirm the delusion, that the\r\npossession of more and more land is the only thing to be desired, alike\r\nby the selfish and the patriotic; by those who would hastily build up\r\ntheir own fortunes, and by those who desire the aggrandisement of their\r\ncountry. No one mourned with me more earnestly over this popular\r\ndelusion than a member of Congress, who has since been one of the most\r\nvehement advocates of the Texan cause, and has thereby done his best to\r\nfoster the delusion. He told me that the metaphysics of society in the\r\nsouth afford a curious study to the observer; and that they are\r\nhumbling to a resident. He told me that, so far from the honour and\r\nhappiness of any region being supposed to lie in the pursuit of the\r\nhigher objects of life, any man would be pronounced \"imbecile\" who,\r\nhaving enough for his moderate wants, should prefer the enjoyment of his\r\npatrimony, his family relations, and intercourse with the society in\r\nwhich he was brought up, to wandering away in pursuit of more land. He\r\ncomplained that he was heart-sick when he heard of American books: that\r\nthere was no character of permanence in anything;--all was fluctuation,\r\nexcept the passion for land, which, under the name of enterprise, or\r\npatriotism; or something else that was creditable, would last till his\r\ncountrymen had pushed their out-posts to the Pacific. He insisted that\r\nthe only consolation arose from what was to be hoped when pioneering\r\nmust, perforce, come to a stop. He told me of one and another of his\r\nintelligent and pleasant young neighbours, who were quitting their homes\r\nand civilised life, and carrying their brides \"as bondwomen\" into the\r\nwilderness, because fine land was cheap there. If all this be true of\r\nthe young gentry of the south, as I believe it is, what hope is there\r\nthat the delusion will not long remain among those who have no other\r\nguides than Experience;--that slowest of all teachers?\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have, however, kept their eyes open to\r\none great danger, arising from this love of land. They have always had\r\nin view the disadvantage of rich men purchasing tracts larger than they\r\ncould cultivate. They saw that it was contrary to the public interest\r\nthat individuals should be allowed to interpose a desert between other\r\nsettlers whose welfare depends much on their having means of free\r\ncommunication, and a peopled neighbourhood; and that it is inconsistent\r\nwith republican modes that overgrown fortunes should arise by means of\r\nan early grasping of large quantities of a cheap kind of property, which\r\nmust inevitably become of the highest value in course of time. The\r\nreduction in the price of land would probably have been greater, but for\r\nthe temptation which the cheapening would hold out to capitalists.\r\nAnother reason assigned for not still further lowering the price is, the\r\ndanger of depreciating a kind of property held by the largest proportion\r\nof the people. This is obviously unsound; since the property held by\r\nthis large proportion of the people is improved land, whose relation in\r\nvalue to other kinds of property is determined by quite other\r\ncircumstances than the amount of the original purchase-money. The number\r\nof people who sell again unimproved land is so small as not to be worthy\r\nto enter into the account.\r\n\r\nLarge grants of land have been made to schools and colleges. Upwards of\r\neight millions of acres have, I believe, been thus disposed of. There\r\nseems no objection to this, at the time it was done; as there can be no\r\ndoubt that grants will be cultivated that have such an interest hanging\r\non their cultivation. These grants were made while there was a national\r\ndebt. Now, there is a surplus revenue; and appropriations of this kind\r\nhad better be made henceforth from the money which has arisen from the\r\nsale of land than in a way which would force more land into the market.\r\nIt is to be hoped, too, that no more recompenses for public service will\r\nbe offered in land, like the large grants which were made to soldiers\r\nafter the revolutionary war. The soldiers have disposed of their lands\r\nmuch under the governmental price, in order to obtain a sale; and the\r\nhurtful dispersion of settlers, and the sale of tracts too large to be\r\nwell-cultivated, have been thereby assisted.\r\n\r\nThe great question incessantly repeated throughout the United States\r\nis, what is to be done with the immense amount of land remaining unsold;\r\nand with the perpetually increasing revenue arising from the sale, as it\r\nproceeds? Various propositions are afloat,--none of which appear to me\r\nso wise as some which remain to be offered. One proposition is to divide\r\nthe lands again among the States, apportioning the amount according to\r\nthe representation in Congress, or to the population as given by the\r\nlast census. Besides the difficulty of making the apportionment fairly,\r\nthis plan would afford fatal inducements to a greater dispersion of\r\npeople than has yet taken place. It is also argued that no\r\nconstitutional power exists by which the cession of 1787 can be\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nAnother proposition is, to let the sale of lands go on as it does now,\r\nand divide the proceeds among the several States, for purposes of\r\nEducation, Colonisation of the coloured race, and Internal Improvements.\r\nUnder such a plan, there would be endless disputes about the amounts to\r\nbe paid over to the different States. The general government would have\r\na new and dangerous function assigned to it. Besides, as much of the\r\nsurplus revenue is derived from duties, it seems a shorter and more\r\nnatural method to leave off levying money that is not wanted, than to\r\nlevy it, use it, and make a distribution of other funds among the\r\nStates. This subject will, however, come under consideration hereafter.\r\n\r\nOthers propose that nothing should be done: that the lands should go on\r\nbeing sold according to the present demand, and the proceeds to\r\naccumulate, till some accident happens,--a war, or other expensive\r\nadventure,--to help to dissipate them. The first part of the proposition\r\nwill probably stand good: for it seems a difficult thing to raise the\r\nprice of land again:--an impossible thing, till the people shall show\r\nthat they understand the case by demanding an increase of price: but the\r\nsecond part of the proposition cannot be acceded to. It is inconsistent\r\nwith the first principles of democracy that large sums of money should\r\naccumulate in the hands of the general government. The accumulation must\r\nbe disposed of, and the sources of revenue restrained.\r\n\r\nThere are modes of advantageously disposing of the surplus revenue which\r\nare obvious to those whose economical experience is precisely the\r\nreverse of that of the people of the United States. They are not likely\r\nto be at present assented to,--perhaps even to be tolerated by the\r\ninhabitants of the new world. Such as they are, they will be presented\r\nin the next section.\r\n\r\nThe lowest price given of late for land, that I heard of, was a\r\nquarter-dollar per acre; (for these are not times when three thousand\r\nacres are to be had for a rifle; and a whole promontory for a suit of\r\nclothes.) Some good land may be still had, at a distance from roads and\r\nmarkets, from those who want to turn their surplus land into money, for\r\na quarter-dollar per acre. Some that I saw in New Hampshire under these\r\ncircumstances has advanced in five years to a dollar and a half per\r\nacre: and some of about equal quality, about fifteen miles nearer to a\r\nmarket, sold at the same time for ten dollars per acre. I saw some low\r\nland, on the banks of the river, near Pittsburg, which would not sell at\r\nany price a few years ago, when salt was brought over the mountains on\r\npack-horses, and sold at a dollar a quart. Now salt is obtained in any\r\nquantity by digging near this land; and the meadow is parted into lots\r\nof ten acres each, which sell at the rate of one thousand dollars per\r\nacre. This is, no doubt, in prospect of the salt-works which are\r\ndestined to flourish here. The highest price I heard of being given\r\n(unless in a similar case in New York) was for street lots in Mobile;\r\none hundred and ten dollars per foot frontage.\r\n\r\nFor agricultural purposes, the price of land varies, according to its\r\nfertility, and, much more, to its vicinity to a market, in a manner\r\nwhich cannot easily be specified. I think the highest price I heard of\r\nwas fifteen hundred dollars per acre. This was in the south. In the\r\nnorth and west, I heard of prices varying from thirty to one hundred\r\ndollars, even in somewhat retired situations. One thing seems to be\r\ngranted on all hands: that a settler cannot fail of success, if he takes\r\ngood land, in a healthy situation, at the government price. If he\r\nbestows moderate pains on his lot, he may confidently reckon on its\r\nbeing worth at least double at the end of the year: much more, if there\r\nare growing probabilities of a market.\r\n\r\nThe methods according to which the sales of the public lands in the\r\nUnited States are conducted are excellent. The lots are so divided as to\r\npreclude all doubt and litigation about boundaries. There is a general\r\nland-office at Washington, and a subordinate one in each district, where\r\nall business can be transacted with readiness and exactitude. Periodical\r\nsales are made of lands which it is desirable to bring into the market.\r\nThese are disposed of to the highest bidder. The advance of the\r\npopulation into the wilderness is thus made more regular than it would\r\nbe if there were not a rendezvous in each district, where it could be\r\nascertained how the settlement of the neighbouring country was going on;\r\ntitles are made more secure; and less impunity is allowed to fraud.\r\n\r\nThe pre-emption laws, originally designed for the benefit of poor\r\nsettlers, have been the greatest provocatives to fraud. It seemed hard\r\nthat a squatter, who had settled himself on unoccupied land, and done\r\nit nothing but good, should be turned off without remuneration, or\r\ncompelled to purchase his own improvements; and in 1830, a bill was\r\ntherefore passed, granting a pre-emption right to squatters who had\r\ntaken such possession of unsold lands. It provided that when two\r\nindividuals had cultivated a quarter section of land, (one hundred and\r\nsixty acres,) each should have a pre-emption right with regard to half\r\nthe cultivated portion: and each also to a pre-emption of eighty acres\r\nanywhere else in the same land district. Of course, abundance of persons\r\ntook advantage of this law to get the best land very cheap. Two men, by\r\nmerely cutting down, or blazing a few trees, or \"camping out\" for a\r\nnight or two, on a good quarter-section, have secured it at the minimum\r\nprice. A Report to Congress states that there is reason to believe that\r\n\"large companies have been founded, who procure affidavits of\r\nimprovements to be made, get the warrants issued upon them, and whenever\r\na good tract of land is ready for sale, cover it over with their\r\n_floats_, (warrants of the required habitation,) and thus put down\r\ncompetition. The frauds upon the public, within the past year, (1835,)\r\nfrom this single source, have arisen to many millions of dollars.\" Such\r\nerrors in matters of detail are sure to be corrected soon after being\r\ndiscovered. The means will speedily be found of showing a due regard to\r\nthe claims of squatters, without precipitating the settlement of land by\r\nunfairly reducing its price in the market. Whatever methods may tend to\r\nlessen rather than to increase the facilities for occupying new land,\r\nmust, on the whole, be an advantage, while the disproportion between\r\nland and labour is so great as it now is in the western regions of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nRURAL LABOUR.\r\n\r\nEnglish farmers settling in the United States used to be a joke to their\r\nnative neighbours. The Englishman began with laughing, or being shocked,\r\nat the slovenly methods of cultivation employed by the American\r\nsettlers: he was next seen to look grave on his own account; and ended\r\nby following the American plan.\r\n\r\nThe American ploughs round the stumps of the trees he has felled, and is\r\nnot very careful to measure the area he ploughs, and the seed he sows.\r\nThe Englishman clears half the quantity of land,--clears it very\r\nthoroughly; ploughs deep, sows thick, raises twice the quantity of grain\r\non half the area of land, and points proudly to his crop. But the\r\nAmerican has, meantime, fenced, cleared, and sown more land, improved\r\nhis house and stock, and kept his money in his pocket. The Englishman\r\nhas paid for the labour bestowed on his beautiful fields more than his\r\nfine crop repays him. When he has done thus for a few seasons, till his\r\nmoney is gone, he learns that he has got to a place where it answers to\r\nspend land to save labour; the reverse of his experience in England; and\r\nhe soon becomes as slovenly a farmer as the American, and begins\r\nimmediately to grow rich.\r\n\r\nIt would puzzle a philosopher to compute how long some prejudices will\r\nsubsist in defiance of, not only evidence, but personal experience.\r\nThese same Americans, who laugh (reasonably enough) at the prejudiced\r\nEnglish farmer, seem themselves incapable of being convinced on a point\r\nquite as plain as that between him and themselves. The very ground of\r\ntheir triumph over him is their knowledge of the much smaller value of\r\nland, and greater value of labour, in America than in England: and yet\r\nthere is no one subject on which so many complaints are to be heard from\r\nevery class of American society as the immigration of foreigners. The\r\nincapacity of men to recognise blessings in disguise has been the theme\r\nof moralists in all ages: but it might be expected that the Americans,\r\nin this case, would be an exception. It is wonderful, to a stranger, to\r\nsee how they fret and toil, and scheme and invent, to supply the\r\ndeficiency of help, and all the time quarrel with the one means by which\r\nlabour is brought to their door. The immigration of foreigners was the\r\none complaint by which I was met in every corner of the free States; and\r\nI really believe I did not converse with a dozen persons who saw the\r\nultimate good through the present apparent evil.\r\n\r\nIt is not much to be wondered at that gentlemen and ladies, living in\r\nBoston and New York, and seeing, for the first time in their lives,\r\nhalf-naked and squalid persons in the street, should ask where they come\r\nfrom, and fear lest they should infect others with their squalor, and\r\nwish they would keep away. It is not much to be wondered at that the\r\nmanagers of charitable institutions in the maritime cities should be\r\nweary of the claims advanced by indigent foreigners: but it is\r\nsurprising that these gentlemen and ladies should not learn by\r\nexperience that all this ends well, and that matters are taking their\r\nnatural course. It would certainly be better that the emigrants should\r\nbe well clothed, educated, respectable people; (except that, in that\r\ncase, they would probably never arrive;) but the blame of their bad\r\ncondition rests elsewhere, while their arrival is, generally speaking,\r\nalmost a pure benefit. Some are intemperate and profligate; and such\r\nare, no doubt, a great injury to the cities where they harbour; but the\r\ngreater number show themselves decent and hardworking enough, when put\r\ninto employment. Every American acknowledges that few or no canals or\r\nrailroads would be in existence now, in the United States, but for the\r\nIrish labour by which they have been completed: and the best cultivation\r\nthat is to be seen in the land is owing to the Dutch and Germans it\r\ncontains. What would housekeepers do for domestic service without\r\nforeigners? If the American ports had been barred against immigration,\r\nand the sixty thousand foreigners per annum, with all their progeny, had\r\nbeen excluded, where would now have been the public works of the United\r\nStates, the agriculture, the shipping?\r\n\r\nThe most emphatic complainers of the immigration of foreigners are those\r\nwho imagine that the morals of society suffer thereby. My own conviction\r\nis that the morals of society are, on the whole, thereby much improved.\r\nIt is candidly allowed, on all hands, that the passion of the Irish for\r\nthe education of their children is a great set-off against the bad\r\nqualities some of them exhibit in their own persons; and that the second\r\nand third generations of Irish are among the most valuable citizens of\r\nthe republic. The immigrant Germans are more sober and respectable than\r\nthe Irish; but there is more difficulty in improving them and their\r\nchildren. The Scotch are in high esteem. My own opinion is that most of\r\nthe evils charged upon the immigrants are chargeable upon the\r\nmismanagement of them in the ports. The atrocious corruption of the New\r\nYork elections, where an Irishman, just landed, and employed upon the\r\ndrains, perjures himself, and votes nine times over, is chargeable, not\r\nupon immigration, nor yet upon universal suffrage, but upon faults in\r\nthe machinery of registration. Again, if the great pauper-palace, over\r\nthe Schuylkill, near Philadelphia, be half full of foreigners; if it be\r\ntrue that an Irish woman was seen to walk round it, and heard to observe\r\nthat she should immediately write over for all her relations; the evil\r\nis chargeable upon there being a pauper-palace, with the best of food\r\nand clothing, and no compulsion to work, in a country where there is far\r\nmore work and wages than there are hands to labour and earn. There is in\r\nNew York a benevolent gentleman who exercises a most useful and\r\neffectual charity. He keeps a kind of registry office for the demand and\r\nsupply of emigrant labour; takes charge of the funds of such emigrants\r\nas are fortunate enough to have any; and befriends them in every way. He\r\ndeclares that he has an average of six situations on his list ready for\r\nevery sober, able-bodied man and woman that lands at New York.\r\n\r\nThe bad moral consequences of a dispersion of agricultural labour, and\r\nthe good moral effects of an adequate combination, are so serious as to\r\nrender it the duty of good citizens to inform themselves fully of the\r\nbearings of this question before they attempt to influence other minds\r\nupon it. Those who have seen what are the morals and manners of families\r\nwho live alone in the wilds, with no human opinion around them, no\r\nneighbours with whom to exchange good offices, no stimulus to mental\r\nactivity, no social amusements, no church, _no life_, nothing but the\r\npursuit of the outward means of living,--any one who has witnessed this\r\nwill be ready to agree what a blessing it would be to such a family to\r\nshake down a shower of even poor Irish labourers around them. To such a\r\nfamily no tidings ought to be more welcome than of the arrival of\r\nship-load after ship-load of immigrants at the ports, some few of whom\r\nmay wander hitherwards, and by entering into a combination of labour to\r\nobtain means of living, open a way to the attainment of the ends. Sixty\r\nthousand immigrants a-year! What are these spread over so many thousand\r\nsquare miles? If the country could be looked down upon from a balloon,\r\nsome large clusters of these would be seen detained in the cities,\r\nbecause they could not be spared into the country; other clusters would\r\nbe seen about the canals and railroads; and a very slight sprinkling in\r\nthe back country, where their stations would be marked by the prosperity\r\ngrowing up around them.\r\n\r\nThe expedients used in the country settlements to secure a combination\r\nof labour when it is absolutely necessary, show how eminently deficient\r\nit is. Every one has heard of the \"frolic\" or \"bee,\" by means of which\r\nthe clearing of lots, the raising of houses, the harvesting of crops is\r\nachieved. Roads are made, and kept by contributions of labour and teams,\r\nby settlers. For the rest, what can be done by family labour alone is so\r\ndone, with great waste of time, material, and toil. The wonderful\r\neffects of a \"frolic,\" in every way, should serve, in contrast with the\r\ntoil and difficulty usually expended in producing small results, to\r\nincline the hearts of settlers towards immigrants, and to plan how an\r\nincrease of them may be obtained.\r\n\r\nMinds are, I hope, beginning to turn in this direction. In New England,\r\nwhere there is the most combination of labour, and the poorest land, it\r\nis amusing to see the beginning of discoveries on this head. I find, in\r\nthe United States' Almanack for 1835, an article on agricultural\r\nimprovements, (presupposing a supply of labour as the primary\r\nrequisite,) which bears all the marks of freshness and originality, of\r\nhaving been a discovery of the writer's.\r\n\r\n\"If such improvements as are possible, or even easy,\" (where there is\r\nlabour at hand,) \"were made in the husbandry of this country, many and\r\ngreat advantages would be found to arise. As twice the number of people\r\nmight be supported on the same quantity of land, all our farming towns\r\nwould become twice as populous as they are likely to be in the present\r\nstate of husbandry. There would be, in general, but half the distance to\r\ntravel to visit one's friends and acquaintances. Friends might oftener\r\nsee and converse with each other. Half the labour would be saved in\r\ncarrying the corn to mill, and the produce to market; half the\r\njourneying saved in attending our courts; and half the expense in\r\nsupporting government, and in making and repairing roads; half the\r\ndistance saved in going to the smith, weaver, clothier, &c.; half the\r\ndistance saved in going to public worship, and most other meetings; for\r\nwhere steeples are four miles apart, they would be only two or three.\r\nMuch time, expense and labour would, on these accounts, be saved; and\r\ncivilisation, with all the social virtues, would, perhaps, be\r\nproportionally promoted and increased.\"\r\n\r\nBefore this can be done, there must be hands to do it. Steeples must\r\nremain four or fourteen miles apart, till there are beings enough in the\r\nintervening space to draw them together. I saw, on the Mississippi, a\r\nwoman in a canoe, paddling up against the stream; probably, as I was\r\ntold, to visit a neighbour twenty or thirty miles off. The only comfort\r\nwas that the current would bring her back four times as quickly as she\r\nwent up. What a blessing would a party of emigrant neighbours be to a\r\nwoman who would row herself twenty miles against the stream of the\r\nMississippi for companionship!\r\n\r\nInstead of complaining of the sixty thousand emigrants per annum, and\r\nlowering the price of land, so as to induce dispersion, it would be\r\nwise, if it were possible, in the people of the United States to bring\r\nin sixty thousand more labourers per annum, and raise the price of land.\r\nThis last cannot, perhaps, be done: but why should not the other? With a\r\nsurplus revenue that they do not know what to do with, and a scarcity of\r\nthe labour which they do not know how to do without, why not use the\r\nsurplus funds accruing from the lands in carrying labour to the soil?\r\n\r\nIt is true, Europeans have the same passion for land as the Americans;\r\nand such immigrants would leave their employers, and buy for themselves,\r\nas soon as they had earned the requisite funds: but these, again, would\r\nsupply the means of bringing over more labour; and the intermediate\r\nservices of the labourers would be so much gained. If the arrangements\r\nwere so made as to bring over sober, respectable labourers, without\r\ntheir being in any way bound to servitude, (as a host of poor Germans\r\nonce were made white slaves of,) if, the land and labour being once\r\nbrought together, and repayment from the benefited parties being\r\nsecured, (if desired,) things were then left to take their natural\r\ncourse, a greater blessing could hardly befal the United States than\r\nsuch an importation of labourers.\r\n\r\nI was told, in every eastern city, that it was a common practice with\r\nparish officers in England to ship off their paupers to the United\r\nStates. I took some pains to investigate the grounds of this charge, and\r\nam convinced that it is a mistake; that the accusation has arisen out of\r\nsome insulated case. I was happy to be able to show my American friends\r\nhow the supposed surplus population of the English agricultural counties\r\nhas shrunk, and in most cases disappeared, under the operation of the\r\nnew Poor Law, so that, even if the charge had ever been true, it could\r\nnot long remain so. By the time that we shall be enabled to say the same\r\nof the parishes of Ireland, the Americans will, doubtless, have\r\ndiscovered that they would be glad of all the labourers we had ever been\r\nable to spare; if only we could send them in the form of respectable men\r\nand women, instead of squalid paupers, looking as if they were going\r\nfrom shore to shore, to rouse the world to an outcry against the sins\r\nand sorrows of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be credited by those who are not already informed on\r\nthe subject, that a proposition has been made to send out of the country\r\nan equal number of persons to the amount brought into it; ship loads of\r\nlabourers going to and fro, like buckets in a well: that this\r\nproposition has been introduced into Congress, and has been made the\r\nbasis of appropriations in some State legislatures: that itinerant\r\nlecturers are employed to advocate the scheme: that it is preached from\r\nthe pulpit, and subscribed for in the churches, and that in its behalf\r\nare enlisted members of the administration, a great number of the\r\nleading politicians, clergy, merchants, and planters, and a large\r\nproportion of the other citizens of the United States. It matters little\r\nhow many or how great are the men engaged in behalf of a bad scheme,\r\nwhich is so unnatural that it cannot but fail:--it matters little, as\r\nfar as the scheme itself is concerned; but it is of incalculable\r\nconsequence as creating an obstruction. For itself, the miserable\r\nabortion--the Colonisation scheme--might be passed over; for its active\r\nresults will be nothing; but it is necessary to refer to it in its\r\npassive character of an obstruction. It is necessary to refer thus to\r\nit, not only as a matter of fact, but because, absurd and impracticable\r\nas the scheme clearly is, when viewed in relation to the whole state of\r\naffairs in America, it is not so easy on the spot to discern its true\r\ncharacter. So many perplexing considerations are mixed up with it by its\r\nadvocates; so many of those advocates are men of earnest philanthropy,\r\nand well versed in the details of the scheme, while blind to its general\r\nbearing, that it is difficult to have general principles always in\r\nreadiness to meet opposing facts; to help adopting the partial views of\r\nwell-meaning and thoroughly persuaded persons; and to know where to\r\ndoubt, and what to disbelieve. I went to America extremely doubtful\r\nabout the character of this institution. I heard at Baltimore and\r\nWashington all that could be said in its favour, by persons conversant\r\nwith slavery, which I had not then seen. Mr. Madison, the President of\r\nthe Colonisation Society, gave me his favourable views of it. Mr. Clay,\r\nthe Vice-President, gave me his. So did almost every clergyman and other\r\nmember of society whom I met for some months. Much time, observation,\r\nand reflection were necessary to form a judgment for myself, after so\r\nmuch prepossession, even in so clear a case as I now see this to be.\r\nOthers on the spot must have the same allowance as was necessary for me:\r\nand, if any pecuniary interest be involved in the question, much more.\r\nBut, I am firmly persuaded that any clear-headed man, shutting himself\r\nup in his closet for a day's study of the question, or taking a voyage,\r\nso as to be able to look back upon the entire country he has\r\nleft,--being careful to take in the whole of its economical aspect, (to\r\nsay nothing, at present, of the moral,) can come to no other conclusion\r\nthan that the scheme of transporting the coloured population of the\r\nUnited States to the coast of Africa is absolutely absurd; and, if it\r\nwere not so, would be absolutely pernicious. But, in matters of\r\neconomy, the pernicious and the absurd are usually identical.\r\n\r\nNo one is to be blamed for the origin of slavery. Because it is now,\r\nunder conviction, wicked, it does not follow that it was instituted in\r\nwickedness. Those who began it, knew not what they did. It has been\r\nelsewhere[17] ably shown how slavery has always, and, to all appearance,\r\nunavoidably existed, in some form or other, wherever large new tracts of\r\nland have been taken possession of by a few agricultural settlers. Let\r\nit be granted that negro slavery was begun inadvertently in the West\r\nIndia islands, and continued, by an economical necessity, in the\r\ncolonies of North America.\r\n\r\nWhat is now the state of the case? Slavery, of a very mild kind, has\r\nbeen abolished in the northern parts of the Union, where agricultural\r\nlabour can be carried on by whites, and where such employments bear a\r\nvery reduced proportion to manufacturing and commercial occupations. Its\r\nintroduction into the north-western portions of the country has been\r\nprohibited by those who had had experience of its evils. Slavery,\r\ngenerally of a very aggravated character, now subsists in thirteen\r\nStates out of twenty-six, and those thirteen are the States which grow\r\nthe tobacco, rice, cotton and sugar; it being generally alleged that\r\nrice and sugar cannot be raised by white labour, while some maintain\r\nthat they may. I found few who doubted that tobacco and cotton may be\r\ngrown by white labour, with the assistance from brute labour and\r\nmachinery which would follow upon the disuse of human capital; The\r\namount of the slave population is now above two millions and a half. It\r\nincreases rapidly in the States which have been impoverished by slavery;\r\nand is killed off; but not with equal rapidity, on the virgin soils to\r\nwhich alone it is, in any degree, appropriate. It has become\r\nunquestionably inappropriate in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and\r\nKentucky. To these I should be disposed to add Missouri, and North\r\nCarolina, and part of Tennessee and South Carolina. The States which\r\nhave more slave labour than their deteriorated lands require, sell it to\r\nthose which have a deficiency of labour to their rich lands. Virginia,\r\nnow in a very depressed condition, derives her chief revenue from the\r\nrearing of slaves, as stock, to be sent to Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nLouisiana. The march of circumstance has become too obvious to escape\r\nthe attention of the most short-sighted. No one can fail to perceive\r\nthat slavery, like an army of locusts, is compelled to shift its place,\r\nby the desolation it has made. Its progress is southwards; and now,\r\nhaving reached the sea there, south-westwards. If there were but an\r\nimpassable barrier there, its doom would be certain, and not very\r\nremote. This doom was apparently sealed a while ago, by the abolition of\r\nslavery in Mexico, and the fair chance there seemed of Missouri and\r\nArkansas being subjected to a restriction of the same purport with that\r\nimposed on the new States, north-west of the Ohio. This doom has been,\r\nfor the present, cancelled by the admission of slavery into Missouri and\r\nArkansas, and by the seizure of Texas by American citizens. The open\r\nquestion, however, only regards its final limits. Its speedy abolition\r\nin many of the States may be, and is, regarded as certain.\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery was a political anomaly at the time of the\r\nRevolution. It has now become an economical one also. Nothing can\r\nprevent the generality of persons from seeing this, however blind a few,\r\na very few persons on the spot may be to the truth.[18]\r\n\r\nIt has thus obviously become the interest of all to whom slavery still\r\nis, or is believed to be, a gain; of those who hold the richest lands;\r\nof those who rear slaves for such lands; of all who dread change; of all\r\nwho would go quietly through life, and leave it to a future generation\r\nto cope with their difficulty,--it has become the interest of all such\r\nto turn their own attention and that of others from the fact that the\r\ntime has come when the slaves ought to be made free labourers. They\r\ncannot put down the fact into utter silence. Some sort of compromise\r\nmust be made with it. A tub must be thrown to the whale. A tub has been\r\nfound which will almost hold the whale.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by the Colonisation Society that free persons of colour\r\nshall be sent to establish and conduct a civilised community on the\r\nshores of Africa. The variety of prospects held out by this proposition\r\nto persons of different views is remarkable. To the imaginative, there\r\nis the picture of the restoration of the coloured race to their paternal\r\nsoil: to the religious, the prospect of evangelising Africa. Those who\r\nwould serve God and Mammon are delighted at being able to work their\r\nslaves during their own lives, and then leave them to the Colonisation\r\nSociety with a bequest of money, (when money must needs be left behind,)\r\nto carry them over to Africa. Those who would be doing, in a small way,\r\nimmediately, let certain of their slaves work for wages which are to\r\ncarry them over to Africa. Those who have slaves too clever or\r\ndiscontented to be safe neighbours, can ship them off to Africa. Those\r\nwho are afraid of the rising intelligence of their free coloured\r\nneighbours, or suffer strongly under the prejudice of colour, can\r\nexercise such social tyranny as shall drive such troublesome persons to\r\nAfrica. The clergy, public lecturers, members of legislatures, religious\r\nsocieties, and charitable individuals, both in the north and south, are\r\nbelieved to be, and believe themselves to be, labouring on behalf of\r\nslaves, when they preach, lecture, obtain appropriations, and subscribe,\r\non behalf of the Colonisation Society. Minds and hearts are laid to\r\nrest,--opiated into a false sleep.\r\n\r\nHere are all manner of people associated for one object, which has the\r\nprimary advantage of being ostensibly benevolent. It has had Mr. Madison\r\nfor its chief officer: Mr. Clay for its second. It has had the aid, for\r\ntwenty years, of almost all the presses and pulpits of the United\r\nStates, and of most of their politicians, members of government, and\r\nleading professional men and merchants, and almost all the planters of\r\ntwelve states, and all the missionary interest. Besides the\r\nsubscriptions arising from so many sources, there have been large\r\nappropriations made by various legislatures. What is the\r\nresult?--Nothing. _Ex nihilo nihil fit._ Out of a chaos of elements no\r\norderly creation can arise but by the operation of a sound principle:\r\nand sound principle here, there is none.\r\n\r\nIn twenty years, the Colonisation Society has removed to Africa between\r\ntwo and three thousand persons;[19] while the annual increase of the\r\nslave population is, by the lowest computation, sixty thousand; and the\r\nnumber of free blacks is upwards of three hundred and sixty-two\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe chief officers of the Colonisation Society look forward to being\r\nable, in a few years, to carry off the present annual increase, and a\r\nfew more; by which time the annual increase will amount to many times\r\nmore than the Society will have carried out from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe leading Colonisation advocates in the south object to abolition,\r\ninvariably on the ground that they should be left without labourers:\r\nwhereas it is the Colonisation scheme which would carry away the\r\nlabourers, and the abolition scheme which would leave them where they\r\nare. To say nothing of the wilfulness of this often-confuted objection,\r\nit proves that those who urge it are not in earnest in advocating\r\nColonisation as ultimate emancipation.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could learn, no leading member of the Colonisation Society\r\nhas freed any of his slaves. Its president had sold twelve, the week\r\nbefore I first saw him. Its vice-president is _obsédé_ by his slaves;\r\nbut retains them all. And so it is, through the whole hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe avowal of a southern gentleman,--\"We have our slaves, and we mean to\r\nkeep them,\"--is echoed on _political_ occasions by the same gentlemen of\r\nthe Colonisation Society, who, on _politic_ or religious occasions,\r\ntreat of colonisation as ultimate emancipation.\r\n\r\nWhile labourers are flocking into other parts of the country, at the\r\nrate of sixty thousand per annum, and are found to be far too few for\r\nthe wants of society, the Colonisation scheme proposes to carry out more\r\nthan this number; and fails of all its ostensible objects till it does\r\nso. A glance at the causes of slavery, and at the present economy of the\r\nUnited States, shows such a scheme to be a bald fiction.\r\n\r\nIt alienates the attention and will of the people, (for the purposes of\r\nthe few,) from the principle of the abolition of slavery, which would\r\nachieve any honest objects of the Colonisation Society, and many more.\r\nLeaving, for the present, the moral consideration of the case, abolition\r\nwould not only leave the land as full of labourers as it is now, but\r\nincalculably augment the supply of labour by substituting willing and\r\nactive service, and improved methods of husbandry, for the forced,\r\ninferior labour, and wasteful arrangements which are always admitted to\r\nbe co-existent with slavery.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of eminent Abolitionists,--eminent for talents, zeal\r\nand high principle,--are converted Colonisationists.\r\n\r\nThis is surely enough.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the Colonisation Society could never have gained\r\nany ground at all, but for the common supposition that the blacks must\r\ngo somewhere. It was a long while before I could make anything of this.\r\nThe argument always ran thus.\r\n\r\n\"Unless they remain as they are, Africa is the only place for them.--It\r\nwill not do to give them a territory; we have seen enough of that with\r\nthe Indians. We are heart-sick of territories: the blacks would all\r\nperish.--Then, the climate of Canada would not suit them: they would\r\nperish there. The Haytians will not take them in: they have a horror of\r\nfreed slaves.--There is no rest for the soles of their feet, anywhere\r\nbut in Africa!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should they not stay where they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible. The laws of the States forbid freed negroes to remain.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present,--on account of the slaves who remain. In case of abolition,\r\nsuch laws would be repealed, of course: and then, why should not the\r\nblacks remain where they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"They could never live among the whites in a state of freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? You are begging the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would die of vice and misery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why more than the German labourers?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do in the free States. They are dying out there constantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes them more vicious than other people?\"\r\n\r\n\"The coloured people always are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean because their colour is the badge of slavery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, when it is no longer so, the degradation, for aught you know,\r\nwill cease.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the circle, described by those who pity the slaves. There is\r\nanother, appropriate to those who pity the masters.\r\n\r\n\"What is to become of the planters, without any labourers? They must\r\nshut up and go away; for they cannot stay in their houses, without any\r\nlabourers on the plantations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the slaves to be all buried? Or are they to evaporate? or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you know, they would all go away. Nothing would make them stay when\r\nthey were once free.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would change masters, no doubt. But as many would remain in the\r\narea as before. Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"The masters could not possibly employ them. They could never manage\r\nthem, except as slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you think that the masters could not have the labourers, because\r\nthey would go away: and the labourers must go away, because the masters\r\nwould not have them.\"\r\n\r\nTo prevent any escape by a nibble in this circle, the other is brought\r\nup round it, to prove that there is no other place than Africa for the\r\nblacks to go to: and thus, the alternative of slavery or colonisation is\r\nsupposed to be established.\r\n\r\nAll action, and all conversation, on behalf of this institution, bears\r\nthe same character,--of arguing in a circle. A magic ring seems drawn\r\nround those who live amidst slavery; and it gives a circular character\r\nto all they think and say and do upon the subject. There are but few who\r\nsit within it who distinctly see anything beyond it. If there were but\r\nany one moral giant within, who would heave a blow at it with all the\r\nforce of a mighty principle, it would be shattered to atoms in a moment;\r\nand the white and black slaves it encloses would be free at once. This\r\nwill be done when more light is poured in under the darkness which\r\nbroods over it: and the time cannot now be far off.\r\n\r\nWhenever I am particularly strongly convinced of anything, in opposition\r\nto the opinion of any or many others, I entertain a suspicion that there\r\nis more evidence on the other side than I see. I felt so, even on this\r\nsubject of slavery, which has been clear to English eyes for so long. I\r\nwent into the slave States with this suspicion in my mind; and I\r\npreserved it there as long as possible. I believe that I have heard\r\nevery argument that can possibly be adduced in vindication or palliation\r\nof slavery, under any circumstances now existing; and I declare that, of\r\nall displays of intellectual perversion and weakness that I have\r\nwitnessed, I have met with none so humbling and so melancholy as the\r\nadvocacy of this institution. I declare that I know the whole of its\r\ntheory;--a declaration that I dare not make with regard to, I think, any\r\nother subject whatever: the result is that I believe there is nothing\r\nrational to be said in vindication or palliation of the protraction of\r\nslavery in the United States.--Having made this avowal; it will not be\r\nexpected that I should fill my pages with a wide superficies of argument\r\nwhich will no more bear a touch than pond-ice, on the last day of thaw.\r\nAs I disposed in my mind the opposite arguments of slave-holders, I\r\nfound that they ate one another up, like the two cats that Sheridan told\r\nof; but without leaving so much as an inch of tail.\r\n\r\nOne mistake, perhaps, deserves notice. Restless slave-holders, whose\r\nuneasiness has urged them to struggle in their toils, and find\r\nthemselves unable to get out but by the loss of everything, (but honour\r\nand conscience,) pointed out to me the laws of their States, whereby the\r\nmanumission of slaves is rendered difficult or impossible to the master,\r\nremaining on the spot, and prospectively fatal to the freed\r\nslave;--pointed out to me these laws as rendering abolition impossible.\r\nTo say nothing of the feebleness of the barriers which human regulations\r\npresent to the changes urged on by the great natural laws of\r\nsociety,--it is a sufficient answer that these State laws present no\r\nobstacle to general, though they do to particular, emancipation. They\r\nwill be cancelled or neglected by the same will which created them, when\r\nthe occasion expires with which they sprang up, or which they were\r\ndesigned to perpetuate. The institution of slavery was not formed in\r\naccordance with them: they arose out of the institution. They are an\r\noffset; and, to use the words of one of their advocates, spoken in\r\nanother connexion, \"they will share the fate of offsets, and perish with\r\nthe parent.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that all laws which encourage the departure of the blacks\r\nmust be repealed, when their slavery is abolished. The one thing\r\nnecessary, in the economical view of the case, is that efficient\r\nmeasures should be taken to prevent an unwise dispersion of these\r\nlabourers: measures, I mean, which should in no way interfere with their\r\npersonal liberty, but which should secure to them generally greater\r\nadvantages on the spot than they could obtain by roaming. It has been\r\ndistinctly shown that slavery originated from the difficulty of\r\nconcentrating labour in the neighbourhood of capitalists. Where the\r\npeople are few in proportion to the land, they are apt to disperse\r\nthemselves over it; so that personal coercion has been supposed\r\nnecessary, in the first instance, to secure any efficient cultivation of\r\nthe land at all. Though the danger and the supposed necessity are past,\r\nin all but the rawest of the slave States, the ancient fact should be so\r\nborne in mind as that what legislation there is should tend to cause a\r\nconcentration, rather than a dispersion of the labourers. Any such\r\ntendency will be much aided by the strong local attachments for which\r\nnegroes are remarkable. It is not only that slaves dread all change,\r\nfrom the intellectual and moral dejection to which they are reduced;\r\nfearing even the removal from one plantation to another, under the same\r\nmaster, from the constant vague apprehension of something dreadful. It\r\nis not only this, (which, however, it would take them some time to\r\noutgrow,) but that all their race show a kind of feline attachment to\r\nplaces to which they are accustomed, which will be of excellent service\r\nto kind masters when the day of emancipation comes. For the rest,\r\nefficient arrangements can and will doubtless be made to prevent their\r\nwandering further than from one master to another. The abolition of\r\nslavery must be complete and immediate: that is to say, as a man either\r\nis or is not the property of another, as there can be no degrees of\r\nownership of a human being, there must be an immediate and complete\r\nsurrender of all claim to negro men, women, and children as property:\r\nbut there may and will doubtless be arrangements made to protect, guide,\r\nand teach these degraded beings, till they have learned what liberty\r\nis, and how to use it. Liberty to change their masters must, under\r\ncertain reasonable limitations, be allowed; the education of their\r\nchildren must be enforced. The amount of wages will be determined by\r\nnatural laws, and cannot be foreseen, further than that they must\r\nnecessarily be very ample for a long time to come. It will probably be\r\nfound desirable to fix the price of the government lands, with a view to\r\nthe coloured people, at that amount which will best obviate squatting,\r\nand secure the respectable settlement of some who may find their way to\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nSuggestions of this kind excite laughter among the masters of slaves,\r\nwho are in the habit of thinking that they know best what negroes are,\r\nand what they are capable of. I have reasons for estimating their\r\nknowledge differently, and for believing that none know so little of the\r\ntrue character and capabilities of negroes as their owners. They might\r\nknow more, but for the pernicious and unnatural secrecy about some of\r\nthe most important facts connected with slave-holding, which is induced\r\npartly by pride, partly by fear, partly by pecuniary interest. If they\r\nwould do themselves and their slaves the justice of inquiring with\r\nprecision what is the state of Hayti; what has taken place in the West\r\nIndies; what the emancipation really was there; what its effects\r\nactually are, they would obtain a clearer view of their own prospects.\r\nSo they would, if they would communicate freely about certain facts\r\nnearer home: not only conversing as individuals, but removing the\r\nrestrictions upon the press by which they lose far more than they gain,\r\nboth in security and fortune,--to say nothing of intelligence. Of the\r\nmany families in which I enjoyed intercourse, there was, I believe, none\r\nwhere I was not told of some one slave of unusual value, for talent or\r\ngoodness, either in the present or a former generation. A collection of\r\nthese alone, as they stand in my journal, would form no mean testimony\r\nto the intellectual and moral capabilities of negroes: and if to these\r\nwere added the tales which I could tell, if I also were not bound under\r\nthe laws of mystery of which I have been complaining, many hearts would\r\nbeat with the desire to restore to their human rights those whose\r\nfellow-sufferers have given ample proof of their worthiness to enjoy\r\nthem. The consideration which binds me to silence upon a rich collection\r\nof facts, full of moral beauty and promise, is regard to the safety of\r\nmany whose heroic obedience to the laws of God has brought them into\r\njeopardy under the laws of slave-holders, and the allies of\r\nslave-holders. Nor would I, by any careless revelations, throw the\r\nslightest obstacle in the way of the escape of any one of the slaves who\r\nmay be about to shirk their masters, by methods with which I happen to\r\nbe acquainted.\r\n\r\nIt can, however, do nothing but good to proclaim the truth that slaves\r\ndo run away in much greater numbers than is supposed by any but those\r\nwho lose them, and those who help them. By which I mean many others\r\nbesides the abolitionists _par excellence_. Perhaps I might confine the\r\nknowledge to these last; for I believe no means exist by which the\r\nyearly amount of loss of this kind may be verified and published in the\r\nsouth. Everybody who has been in America is familiar with the little\r\nnewspaper picture of a black man, hieing with his stick and bundle,\r\nwhich is prefixed to the advertisements of runaways. Every traveller has\r\nprobably been struck with the number of these which meets his eye; but\r\nunless he has more private means of information, he will remain unaware\r\nof the streams of fugitives continually passing out of the States. There\r\nis much reserve about this in the south, from pride; and among those\r\nelsewhere who could tell, from far other considerations. The time will\r\ncome when the whole story, in its wonder and beauty, may be told by some\r\nwho, like myself, have seen more of the matter, from all sides, than it\r\nis easy for a native to do. Suffice it, that the loss by runaways, and\r\nthe generally useless attempts to recover them, is a heavy item in the\r\naccounts of the cotton and sugar-growers of the south; and one which is\r\nsure to become heavier till there shall be no more bondage to escape\r\nfrom. It is obvious that the slaves who run away are among the best: an\r\nescape being usually the achievement of a project early formed;\r\nconcealed, pertinaciously adhered to, and endeared by much toil and\r\nsacrifice undergone for its sake, for a long course of years. A weak\r\nmind is incapable of such a series of acts, with a unity of purpose.\r\nThey are the choicest slaves who run away. Of the cases known to me, the\r\ngreater number of the men, and some of the women, have acted throughout\r\nupon an idea; (called by their owners \"a fancy,\"--a very different\r\nthing;) while some few of the men have started off upon some sudden\r\ninfliction of cruelty; and many women on account of intolerable outrage,\r\nof the grossest kind. Several masters told me of leave given to their\r\nslaves to go away, and of the slaves refusing to avail themselves of it.\r\nIf this was meant to tell in favour of slavery, it failed of its effect.\r\nThe argument was too shallow to impose upon a child. Of course, they\r\nwere the least valuable slaves to whom this permission was given: and\r\ntheir declining to depart proved nothing so much as the utter\r\ndegradation of human beings who could prefer receiving food and shelter\r\nfrom the hand of an owner to the possession of themselves.\r\n\r\nAmidst the mass of materials which accumulated on my hands during the\r\nprocess of learning from all parties their views on this question, I\r\nhardly know where to turn, and what to select, that will most briefly\r\nand strongly show that the times have outgrown slavery. This is the\r\npoint at which every fact and argument issue, whatever may be the\r\nintention of those who adduce it. The most striking, perhaps, is the\r\ntreatment of the Abolitionists: a subject to be adverted to hereafter.\r\nThe insane fury which vents itself upon the few who act upon the\r\nprinciples which the many profess, is a sign of the times not to be\r\nmistaken. It is always the precursor of beneficial change. Society in\r\nAmerica seems to be already passing out of this stage into one even more\r\nadvanced. The cause of abolition is spreading so rapidly through the\r\nheart of the nation; the sound part of the body politic is embracing it\r\nso actively, that no disinterested observer can fail to be persuaded\r\nthat even the question of time is brought within narrow limits. The\r\nelections will, ere long, show the will of the people that slavery be\r\nabolished in the District of Columbia. Then such truckling politicians,\r\nmercenary traders, cowardly clergy, and profligate newspaper corps, as\r\nare now too blind to see the coming change, will have to choose their\r\npart; whether to shrink out of sight, or to boast patriotically of the\r\nrighteous revolution which they have striven to retard, even by the\r\napplication of the torture to both the bodies and the minds of their\r\nmore clear-eyed fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAfter giving one or two testimonies to the necessity of a speedy change\r\nof system, I will confine myself to relating a few signs of the times\r\nwhich I encountered in my travels through the south.\r\n\r\nIn 1782, Virginia repealed the law against manumission; and in nine\r\nyears, there were ten thousand slaves freed in that State. Alarmed for\r\nthe institution, her legislature re-enacted the law. What has been the\r\nconsequence?--Let us take the testimony of the two leading newspapers\r\nof the capital of Virginia, given at a time when the Virginian\r\nlegislature was debating the subject of slavery; and when there was, for\r\nonce, an exposure of the truth from those best qualified to reveal it.\r\nIn 1832, the following remarks appeared in the \"Richmond Enquirer.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is probable, from what we hear, that the committee on the coloured\r\npopulation will report some plan for getting rid of the free people of\r\ncolour. But is this all that can be done? Are we for ever to suffer the\r\ngreatest evil which can scourge our land not only to remain, but to\r\nincrease in its dimensions? 'We may shut our eyes and avert our faces,\r\nif we please,' (writes an eloquent South Carolinian, on his return from\r\nthe north a few weeks ago,) 'but there it is, the dark and growing evil,\r\nat our doors: and meet the question we must at no distant day. God only\r\nknows what it is the part of wise men to do on that momentous and\r\nappalling subject. Of _this_ I am very sure, that the\r\ndifference--nothing short of frightful--between all that exists on one\r\nside of the Potomac, and all on the other, is owing to _that cause\r\nalone_. The disease is deep seated; it is at the heart's core; it is\r\nconsuming, and has all along been consuming, our vitals; and I could\r\nlaugh, if I _could_ laugh on such a subject, at the ignorance and folly\r\nof the politician who ascribes that to an act of the government, which\r\nis the inevitable effect of the eternal laws of nature. What is to be\r\ndone? O my God, I don't know; but something must be done.'\r\n\r\n\"Yes, something must be done; and it is the part of no honest man to\r\ndeny it; of no free press to affect to conceal it. When this dark\r\npopulation is growing upon us; when every new census is but gathering\r\nits appalling numbers upon us; when within a period equal to that in\r\nwhich this federal constitution has been in existence, those numbers\r\nwill increase to more than two millions within Virginia; when our sister\r\nStates are closing their doors upon our blacks for sale; _and when our\r\nwhites are moving westwardly in greater numbers than we like to hear\r\nof_; when this, the fairest land on all this continent, for soil and\r\nclimate and situation combined, might become a sort of garden spot if it\r\nwere worked by the hands of white men alone, _can we, ought we_ to sit\r\nquietly down, fold our arms, and say to each other, 'well, well, this\r\nthing will not come to the worst in our day? We will leave it to our\r\nchildren and our grand-children and great-grand-children to take care of\r\nthemselves, and to brave the storm. Is this to act like wise men? Heaven\r\nknows we are no fanatics. We detest the madness which actuated the _Amis\r\ndes Noirs_. But something ought to be done. Means, sure but gradual,\r\nsystematic but discreet, ought to be adopted for reducing the mass of\r\nevil which is pressing upon the south, and will still more press upon\r\nher the longer it is put off. We ought not to shut our eyes, nor avert\r\nour faces. And though we speak almost without a hope that the committee\r\nor the legislature will do anything, at the present session, to meet\r\nthis question, yet we say now, in the utmost sincerity of our hearts,\r\nthat our wisest men cannot give too much of their attention to this\r\nsubject, nor can they give it too soon.\"\r\n\r\nThe other paper, the \"Richmond Whig,\" had the same time, the following:\r\n\r\n\"We affirm that the great mass of Virginia herself triumphs that the\r\nslavery question has been agitated, and reckons it glorious that the\r\nspirit of her sons did not shrink from grappling with the monster. We\r\naffirm that, in the heaviest slave districts of the State, thousands\r\nhave hailed the discussion with delight, and contemplate the distant,\r\nbut ardently desired result, as the supreme good which Providence could\r\nvouchsafe to their country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless true. One of the signs of the times which struck me\r\nwas the clandestine encouragement received by the abolitionists of the\r\nnorth from certain timid slave-holders of the south, who send money for\r\nthe support of abolition publications, and an earnest blessing. They\r\nwrite, \"For God's sake go on! We cannot take your publications; we dare\r\nnot countenance you; but we wish you God speed! You are our only hope.\"\r\nThere is nothing to be said for the moral courage of those who feel and\r\nwrite thus, and dare not express their opinions in the elections. Much\r\nexcuse may be made for them by those who know the horrors which await\r\nthe expression of anti-slavery sentiments in many parts of the south.\r\nBut, on the other hand, the abolitionists are not to be blamed for\r\nconsidering all slave-holders under the same point of view, as long as\r\nno improved state of opinion is manifested in the representation; the\r\nnatural mirror of the minds of the represented.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Marshall, a Virginian, a slave-holder, and a member of the\r\nColonisation Society, (though regarding this society as being merely a\r\npalliative, and slavery incurable but by convulsion,) observed to a\r\nfriend of mine, in the winter of 1834, that he was surprised at the\r\nBritish for supposing that they could abolish slavery in their colonies\r\nby act of parliament. His friend believed it would be done. The Chief\r\nJustice could not think that such economical institutions could be done\r\naway by legislative enactment. His friend pleaded the fact that the\r\nmembers of the British House of Commons were pledged, in great numbers,\r\nto their constituents on the question. When it was done, the Chief\r\nJustice remarked on his having been mistaken; and that he rejoiced in\r\nit. He now saw hope for his beloved Virginia, which he had seen sinking\r\nlower and lower among the States. The cause, he said, was that work is\r\ndisreputable in a country where a degraded class is held to enforced\r\nlabour.[20] He had seen all the young, the flower of the State, who were\r\nnot rich enough to remain at home in idleness, betaking themselves to\r\nother regions, where they might work without disgrace. Now there was\r\nhope; for he considered that in this act of the British, the decree had\r\ngone forth against American slavery, and its doom was sealed.\r\n\r\nThere was but one sign of the times which was amusing to me; and that\r\nwas the tumult of opinions and prophecies offered to me on the subject\r\nof the duration of slavery, and the mode in which it would be at last\r\ngot rid of; for I never heard of any one but Governor M'Duffie who\r\nsupposed that it can last for ever. He declared last year, in his\r\nmessage to the legislature of South Carolina, that he considers slavery\r\nas the corner-stone of their republican liberties: and that, if he were\r\ndying, his latest prayer should be that his children's children should\r\nlive nowhere but amidst the institutions of slavery. This message might\r\nhave been taken as a freak of eccentricity merely, if it had stood\r\nalone. But a committee of the legislature, with Governor Hamilton in the\r\nchair, thought proper to endorse every sentiment in it. This converts it\r\ninto an indication of the perversion of mind commonly prevalent in a\r\nclass when its distinctive pecuniary interest is in imminent peril. I\r\nwas told, a few months prior to the appearance of this singular\r\nproduction, that though Governor M'Duffie was a great ornament to the\r\nState of South Carolina, his opinions on the subject of slavery were\r\n_ultra_, and that he was left pretty nearly alone in them. Within a\r\nyear, those who told me so went, _in public_, all lengths with Governor\r\nM'Duffie.\r\n\r\nI believe I might very safely and honourably give the names of those who\r\nprophesied to me in the way I have mentioned; for they rather court\r\npublicity for their opinions, as it is natural and right that they\r\nshould, as long as they are sure of them. But it may suffice to mention\r\nthat they are all eminent men, whose attention has been strongly fixed,\r\nfor a length of years, upon the institution in question.\r\n\r\nA. believes that slavery is a necessary and desirable stage in\r\ncivilisation: not on the score of the difficulty of cultivating new\r\nlands without it, but on the ground of the cultivation of the negro mind\r\nand manners. He believes the Haytians to have deteriorated since they\r\nbecame free. He believes the white population destined to absorb the\r\nblack, though holding that the two races will not unite after the third\r\nmixture. His expectation is that the black and mulatto races will have\r\ndisappeared in a hundred and fifty years. He has no doubt that cotton\r\nand tobacco may be well and easily grown by whites.\r\n\r\nB. is confident that the condition of slaves is materially improved, yet\r\nbelieves that they will die out, and that there will be no earlier\r\ncatastrophe. He looks to colonisation, however, as a means of lessening\r\nthe number. This same gentleman told me of a recent visit he had paid to\r\na connexion of his own, who had a large \"force,\" consisting chiefly of\r\nyoung men and women: not one child had been born on the estate for three\r\nyears. This looks very like dying out; but does it go to confirm the\r\nmaterially improved condition of the slaves?\r\n\r\nC. allows slavery to be a great evil; and, if it were now non-existent,\r\nwould not ordain it, if he could. But he thinks the slaves far happier\r\nthan they would have been at home in Africa, and considers that the\r\nsystem works perfectly. He pronounces the slaves \"the most contented,\r\nhappy, industrious peasantry in the world.\" He believes this virtue and\r\ncontent would disappear if they were taught anything whatever; and that\r\nif they were free, they would be, naturally and inevitably, the most\r\nvicious and wretched population ever seen. His expectation is that they\r\nwill increase to such a degree as to make free labour, \"_which always\r\nsupersedes slave labour_,\" necessary in its stead; that the coloured\r\nrace will wander off to new regions, and be ultimately \"absorbed\" by the\r\nwhite. He contemplates no other than this natural change, which he\r\nthinks cannot take place in less than a century and a half. A year\r\nlater, this gentleman told a friend of mine that slavery cannot last\r\nabove twenty years. They must be stringent reasons which have induced so\r\ngreat a change of opinion in twelve months.\r\n\r\nD. thinks slavery an enormous evil, but doubts whether something as bad\r\nwould not arise in its stead. He is a colonisationist, and desires that\r\nthe general government should purchase the slaves, by annual\r\nappropriations, and ship them off to Africa, so as to clear the country\r\nof the coloured people in forty or fifty years. If this is not done, a\r\nservile war, the most horrible that the world has seen, is inevitable.\r\nYet he believes that the institution, though infinitely bad for the\r\nmasters, is better for the slaves than those of any country in Europe\r\nfor its working classes. He is convinced that the tillage of all the\r\ncrops could be better carried on by whites, with the assistance of\r\ncattle and implements, than by negroes.\r\n\r\nE. writes, (October 1835,) \"Certain it is that if men of property and\r\nintelligence in the north have that legitimate influence which that\r\nclass has here, nothing will come of this abolition excitement. All we\r\nhave to say to them is, 'Hands off!' Our _political_ rights[21] are\r\nclear, and shall not be invaded. _We know too much about slavery to be\r\nslaves ourselves._ But I repeat, nothing will come of the present, or\r\nrather recent excitement, for already it is in a great degree passed.\r\nAnd the time is coming when a struggle between pauperism and property,\r\nor, if you choose, between labour and capital in the north, stimulated\r\nby the spirit of Jacksonism, will occupy the people of that quarter to\r\nthe exclusion of our affairs. If any external influence is ever to\r\naffect the institution of slavery in the south, it will not be the\r\nvulgar and ignorant fanaticism of the northern States, intent upon a\r\ncheap charity which is to be done at our expense; but that influence\r\nwill be found in English literature, and the gradual operation of public\r\nopinion. Slavery, so to speak, may be evaporated;--it cannot be drawn\r\noff. If it were, the whole land would be poisoned and desolated.\"\r\n\r\nThe best reply to this letter will be found in the memorable speech of\r\nMr. Preston, one of the South Carolina senators, delivered in Congress,\r\nlast spring. It may be mentioned, by the way, that the writer of the\r\nabove is mistaken in supposing that there is at present, or impending,\r\nany unhappy struggle in the north between pauperism and property, or\r\nlabour and capital. It is all property there, and no pauperism, (except\r\nthe very little that is superinduced;) and labour and capital were,\r\nperhaps, never before seen to jog on so lovingly together. The \"cheap\r\ncharity\" he speaks of is the cheap charity of the first Christians, with\r\nthe addition of an equal ability and will to pay down _money_ for the\r\nabolition of the slaves, for whose sake the abolitionists have already\r\nshown themselves able to bear,--some, hanging;--some, scourging, and\r\ntarring and feathering; some, privation of the means of living; and all,\r\nthe being incessantly and deeply wounded in their social relations and\r\ntenderest affections. Martyrdom is ever accounted a \"cheap devotion,\" or\r\n\"cheap charity,\" to God or man, by those who exact it of either\r\nreligious or philanthropic principle.\r\n\r\nMr. Preston's speech describes the spread of abolition opinions as being\r\nrapid and inevitable. He proves the rapidity by citing the number of\r\nrecently-formed abolition societies in the north; and the\r\ninevitableness, by exhibiting the course which such convictions had run\r\nin England and France. He represents the case as desperate. He\r\nadvises,--not yielding, but the absolute exclusion of opinion on the\r\nsubject,--exclusion from Congress, and exclusion from the slave States.\r\nThis is well. The matter may be considered to be given up, unless this\r\nis merely the opinion of an individual. The proposal is about as hopeful\r\nas it would be to draw a cordon round the Capitol to keep out the four\r\nwinds; or to build a wall up to the pole-star to exclude the sunshine.\r\n\r\nOne more sample of opinions. A gentleman who edits a highly-esteemed\r\nsouthern newspaper, expresses himself thus. \"There is a wild fanaticism\r\nat work to effect the overthrow of the system, although in its fall\r\nwould go down the fortunes of the south, and to a great extent those of\r\nthe north and east;--in a word, the whole fabric of our Union, in one\r\nawful ruin. What then ought to be done? What measures ought to be taken\r\nto secure the safety of our property and our lives? We answer, let us be\r\nvigilant and watchful to the last degree over all the movements of our\r\nenemies both at _home_ and abroad. Let us declare through the public\r\njournals of our country, that the question of slavery is not, and shall\r\nnot be open to discussion;--that the system is deep-rooted amongst us,\r\nand must remain for ever;--that the very moment any private individual\r\nattempts to lecture us upon its evils and immorality, and the necessity\r\nof putting measures into operation to secure us from them, in the same\r\nmoment his tongue shall be cut out and cast upon the dung-hill. We are\r\nfreemen, sprung from a noble stock of freemen, able to boast as noble a\r\nline of ancestry as ever graced this earth;--we have burning in our\r\nbosoms the spirit of freemen--live in an age of enlightened freedom, and\r\nin a country blessed with its privileges--under a government that has\r\npledged itself to protect us in the enjoyment of our peculiar domestic\r\ninstitutions in peace, and undisturbed. We hope for a long continuance\r\nof these high privileges, and have now to love, cherish, and defend,\r\nproperty, liberty, wives and children, the right to manage our own\r\nmatters in our own way, and, what is equally dear with all the rest, the\r\ninestimable right of dying upon our own soil, around our own firesides,\r\nin struggling to put down all those who may attempt to infringe, attack,\r\nor violate any of these sacred and inestimable privileges.\"\r\n\r\nIf these opinions of well-prepared persons, dispersed through the slave\r\nStates, and entrusted with the public advocacy of their interests, do\r\nnot betoken that slavery is tottering to its fall, there are no such\r\nthings as signs of the times.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of books containing anything against slavery, has\r\nproceeded to a great length. Last year, Mrs. Barbauld's works were sent\r\nback into the north by the southern booksellers, because the \"Evenings\r\nat Home\" contain a \"Dialogue between Master and Slave.\" Miss Sedgwick's\r\nlast novel, \"The Linwoods,\" was treated in the same way, on account of a\r\nsingle sentence about slavery. The \"Tales of the Woods and Fields,\" and\r\nother English books, have shared the same fate. I had a letter from a\r\nSouthern lady, containing some regrets upon the necessity of such an\r\nexclusion of literature, but urging that it was a matter of _principle_\r\nto guard from attacks \"an institution ordained by the favour of God for\r\nthe happiness of man:\" and assuring me that the literary resources of\r\nSouth Carolina were rapidly improving.--So they had need; for almost all\r\nthe books already in existence will have to be prohibited, if nothing\r\ncondemnatory of slavery is to be circulated. This attempt to nullify\r\nliterature was followed up by a threat to refuse permission to the mails\r\nto pass through South Carolina: an arrangement which would afflict its\r\ninhabitants more than it could injure any one else.\r\n\r\nThe object of all this is to keep the children in the dark about how\r\nthe institution is regarded abroad. This was evident to me at every\r\nstep: and I received an express caution not to communicate my\r\ndisapprobation of slavery to the children of one family, who could not,\r\ntheir parents declare, even feel the force of my objections. One of them\r\nwas \"employed, the whole afternoon, in dressing out little Nancy for an\r\nevening party; and she sees the slaves much freer than herself.\" Of\r\ncourse, the blindness of this policy will be its speedy destruction. It\r\nis found that the effect of public opinion on the subject upon young men\r\nwho visit the northern States, is tremendous, when they become aware of\r\nit: as every student in the colleges of the north can bear witness. I\r\nknow of one, an heir of slaves, who declared, on reading Dr. Channing's\r\n\"Slavery,\" that if it could be proved that negroes are more than a link\r\nbetween man and brute, the rest follows of course, and he must liberate\r\nall his. Happily, he is in the way of evidence that negroes are actually\r\nand altogether human.\r\n\r\nThe students of Lane Seminary, near Cincinnati, of which Dr. Beecher is\r\nthe president, became interested in the subject, three or four years\r\nago, and formed themselves into an Abolition Society, debating the\r\nquestion, and taking in newspapers. This was prohibited by the tutors,\r\nbut persevered in by the young men, who conceived that this was a matter\r\nwith which the professors had no right to meddle. Banishment was\r\ndecreed; and all submitted to expulsion but fourteen. Of course, each of\r\nthe dispersed young men became the nucleus of an Abolition Society, and\r\ngained influence by persecution. It was necessary for them to provide\r\nmeans to finish their education. One of them, Amos Dresser, itinerated,\r\n(as is usual in the sparsely-peopled west,) travelling in a gig, and\r\nselling Scott's Bible, to raise money for his educational purposes. He\r\nreached Nashville, in Tennessee; and there fell under suspicion of\r\nabolition treason; his baggage being searched, and a whole abolition\r\nnewspaper, and a part of another being found among the packing-stuff of\r\nhis stock of bibles. There was also an unsubstantiated rumour of his\r\nhaving been seen conversing with slaves. He was brought to trial by the\r\nCommittee of Vigilance; seven elders of the presbyterian church at\r\nNashville being among his judges. After much debate as to whether he\r\nshould be hanged, or flogged with more or fewer lashes, he was condemned\r\nto receive twenty lashes, with a cow-hide, in the market-place of\r\nNashville. He was immediately conducted there, made to kneel down on the\r\nflint pavement, and punished according to his sentence; the mayor of\r\nNashville presiding, and the public executioner being the agent. He was\r\nwarned to leave the city within twenty-four hours: but was told, by some\r\ncharitable person who had the bravery to take him in, wash his stripes,\r\nand furnish him with a disguise, that it would not be safe to remain so\r\nlong. He stole away immediately, in his dreadful condition, on foot; and\r\nwhen his story was authenticated, had heard nothing of his horse, gig,\r\nand bibles, which he values at three hundred dollars. Let no one, on\r\nthis, tremble for republican freedom. Outrages upon it, like the above,\r\nare but extremely transient signs of the times. They no more betoken the\r\npermanent condition of the republic, than the shivering of one hour of\r\nague exhibits the usual state of the human body.\r\n\r\nThe other young men found educational and other assistance immediately;\r\nand a set of noble institutions has grown out of their persecution.\r\nThere were professors ready to help them; and a gentleman gave them a\r\nfarm in Ohio, on which to begin a manual labour college, called the\r\nOberlin Institute. It is on a most liberal plan young women who wish to\r\nbecome qualified for \"Christian teaching\" being admitted; and there\r\nbeing no prejudice of colour. They have a sprinkling both of Indians and\r\nof negroes. They do all the farm and house work, and as much study\r\nbesides as is good for them. Some of the young women are already fair\r\nHebrew and Greek scholars. In a little while, the estate was so crowded,\r\nand the new applications were so overpowering, that they were glad to\r\naccept the gift of another farm. When I left the country, within three\r\nyears from their commencement, they had either four or five flourishing\r\ninstitutions in Ohio and Michigan, while the Lane Seminary drags on\r\nfeebly with its array of tutors, and dearth of pupils. A fact so full of\r\nvitality as this will overbear a hundred less cheering signs of the\r\ntimes. A very safe repose may be found in the will of the majority,\r\nwherever it acts amidst light and freedom.\r\n\r\nJust before I reached Mobile, two men were burned alive there, in a slow\r\nfire, in the open air, in the presence of the gentlemen of the city\r\ngenerally. No word was breathed of the transaction in the newspapers:\r\nand this is the special reason why I cite it as a sign of the times; of\r\nthe suppression of fact and repression of opinion which, from the\r\nimpossibility of their being long maintained, are found immediately to\r\nprecede the changes they are meant to obviate. Some months afterwards,\r\nan obscure intimation of something of the kind having happened appeared\r\nin a northern newspaper; but a dead silence was at the time preserved\r\nupon what was, in fact, the deed of a multitude. The way that I came to\r\nknow it was this. A lady of Mobile was opening her noble and true heart\r\nto me on the horrors and vices of the system under which she and her\r\nfamily were suffering in mind, body, and estate. In speaking of her\r\nduties as head of a family, she had occasion to mention the trouble\r\ncaused by the licentiousness of the whites, among the negro women. It\r\nwas dreadful to hear the facts which had occurred in her own household;\r\nand the bare imagination of what is inflicted on the negro husbands and\r\nfathers was almost too much to be borne. I asked the question, \"Does it\r\nnever enter the heads of negro husbands and fathers to retaliate?\" \"Yes,\r\nit does.\" \"What follows?\" \"They are murdered,--burned alive.\" And then\r\nfollowed the story of what had lately happened. A little girl, and her\r\nstill younger brother, one day failed to return from school, and never\r\nwere seen again. It was not till after all search had been relinquished,\r\nthat the severed head of the little girl was found in a brook, on the\r\nborders of a plantation. Circumstances were discovered that left no\r\ndoubt that the murders were committed to conceal violence which had been\r\noffered to the girl. Soon after, two young ladies of the city rode in\r\nthat direction, and got off their horses to amuse themselves. They were\r\nseized upon by two slaves of the neighbouring plantation; but effected\r\ntheir escape in safety, though with great difficulty. Their agitation\r\nprevented their concealing the fact; and the conclusion was immediately\r\ndrawn that these men were the murderers of the children. The gentlemen\r\nof Mobile turned out; seized the men; heaped up faggots on the margin of\r\nthe brook, and slowly burned them to death. No prudish excuses for the\r\nsuppression of this story will serve any purpose with those who have\r\nbeen on the spot, any more than the outcry about \"amalgamation,\" raised\r\nagainst the abolitionists by those who live in the deepest sinks of a\r\nlicentiousness of which the foes of slavery do not dream. No\r\ndeprecatory plea regarding propriety or decency will pass for anything\r\nbut hypocrisy with those who know what the laws against the press are in\r\nthe south-west, and what are the morals of slavery in its palmy state. I\r\ncharge the silence of Mobile about this murder on its _fears_; as\r\nconfidently as I charge the brutality of the victims upon its crimes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many symptoms of an unmanly and anti-republican fear\r\nwhich met my observation in these regions, it was long before I could\r\ncomprehend the extent of it; especially as I heard daily that the true\r\nenthusiastic love of freedom could exist in a republic, only in the\r\npresence of a servile class. I am persuaded that the southerners verily\r\nbelieve this; that they actually imagine their northern brethren living\r\nin an exceedingly humdrum way, for fear of losing their equality. It is\r\ntrue that there is far too much subservience to opinion in the northern\r\nStates: particularly in New England. There is there a self-imposed\r\nbondage which must be outgrown. But this is no more like the fear which\r\nprevails in the south than the apprehensiveness of a court-physician is\r\nlike the terrors of Tiberius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nI was at the French theatre at New Orleans. The party with whom I went\r\ndetermined to stay for the after-piece. The first scene of the\r\nafter-piece was dumb-show; so much noise was made by one single whistle\r\nin the pit. The curtain was dropped, and the piece re-commenced. The\r\nwhistling continued; and, at one movement, the whole audience rose and\r\nwent home. I was certain that there was something more in this than was\r\napparent to the observation of a stranger. I resolved to find it out,\r\nand succeeded. The band was wanted from the orchestra, to serenade a\r\nUnited States senator who was then in the city; and one or two young men\r\nwere resolved to break up our amusement for the purpose of releasing\r\nthe band. But why were they allowed to do this? Why was the whole\r\naudience to submit to the pleasure of one whistler? Why, in New Orleans\r\nit is thought best to run no risk of any disturbance. People there\r\nalways hie home directly when things do not go off quite quietly.\r\n\r\nIt is the same, wherever the blacks outnumber the whites, or their\r\nbondage is particularly severe. At Charleston, when a fire breaks out,\r\nthe gentlemen all go home on the ringing of the alarm-bell; the ladies\r\nrise and dress themselves and their children. It may be the signal of\r\ninsurrection: and the fire burns on, for any help the citizens give,\r\ntill a battalion of soldiers marches down to put it out.\r\n\r\nWhen we were going to church, at Augusta, Georgia, one Sunday afternoon,\r\nthere was smoke in the street, and a cry of fire. When we came out of\r\nchurch, we were told that it had been very trifling, and easily\r\nextinguished. The next day, I heard the whole. A negro girl of sixteen,\r\nthe property of a lady from New England, had set her mistress's house on\r\nfire in two places, by very in-artificially lighting heaps of\r\ncombustible stuff piled against the partitions. There were no witnesses,\r\nand all that was known came from her own lips. She was desperately\r\nignorant; laws having been fully enforced to prevent the negroes of\r\nGeorgia being instructed in any way whatever. The girl's account was,\r\nthat she was \"tired of living there,\" and had therefore intended to burn\r\nthe house in the morning, but was prevented by her mistress having\r\nlocked her up for some offence: so she did it in the afternoon. She was\r\ntotally ignorant of the gravity of the deed, and was in a state of great\r\nhorror when told that she was to be hanged for it. I asked whether it\r\nwas possible that, after her being prevented by law from being taught,\r\nshe was to be hanged for her ignorance, and merely on her own\r\nconfession? The clergyman with whom I was conversing sighed, and said it\r\nwas a hard case; but what else could be done, considering that _Augusta\r\nwas built of wood_? He told me that there was great excitement among the\r\nnegroes in Augusta; and that many had been saying that \"a mean white\r\nperson\" (a white labourer) would not have been hanged; and that the girl\r\ncould not help it, as it must have been severity which drove her to it.\r\nIn both these sayings, the slaves were partly wrong. A white would have\r\nbeen hanged; but a white would have known that she was committing crime.\r\nIt did not appear that the girl's mistress was harsh. But what does not\r\nthe observation convey? I have never learned, nor ever shall, whether\r\nthe hanging took place or not. The newspapers do not insert such things.\r\n\r\nThis burning would be a fearful art for the blacks to learn. There were\r\nfour tremendous fires in Charleston, during the summer of 1835; and\r\ndivers residents reported to the north that these were supposed to be\r\nthe work of slaves.\r\n\r\nWherever I went, in the south, in whatever town or other settlement I\r\nmade any stay, some startling circumstance connected with slavery\r\noccurred, which I was assured was unprecedented. No such thing had ever\r\noccurred before, or was likely to happen again. The repetition of this\r\nassurance became, at last, quite ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThe fear of which I have spoken as prevalent, does not extend to the\r\ndiscussion of the question of slavery with strangers. My opinions of\r\nslavery were known, through the press, before I went abroad: the\r\nhospitality which was freely extended to me was offered under a full\r\nknowledge of my detestation of the system. This was a great advantage,\r\nin as much as it divested me entirely of the character of a spy, and\r\npromoted the freest discussion, wherever I went. There was a warm\r\nsympathy between myself and very many, whose sufferings under the system\r\ncaused me continual and deep sorrow, though no surprise. Neither was I\r\nsurprised at their differing from me as widely as they do about the\r\nnecessity of immediate action, either by resistance or flight, while\r\noften agreeing, nearly to the full, in my estimate of the evils of the\r\npresent state of things. They have been brought up in the system. To\r\nthem, the moral deformity of the whole is much obscured by its nearness;\r\nwhile the small advantages, and slight prettinesses which it is very\r\neasy to attach to it, are prominent, and always in view. These\r\ncircumstances prevented my being surprised at the candour with which\r\nthey not only discussed the question, but showed me all that was to be\r\nseen of the economical management of plantations; the worst as well as\r\nthe best. Whatever I learned of the system, by express showing, it must\r\nbe remembered, was from the hands of the slave-holders themselves.\r\nWhatever I learned, that lies deepest down in my heart, of the moral\r\nevils, the unspeakable vices and woes of slavery, was from the lips of\r\nthose who are suffering under them on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt was there that I heard of the massacre in Southampton county, which\r\nhas been little spoken of abroad. It happened a few years ago; before\r\nthe abolition movement began; for it is remarkable that no insurrections\r\nhave taken place since the friends of the slave have been busy afar off.\r\nThis is one of the most eloquent signs of the times,--that, whereas\r\nrebellions broke out as often as once a month before, there have been\r\nnone since. Of this hereafter. In the Southampton massacre, upwards of\r\nseventy whites, chiefly women and children, were butchered by slaves who\r\nfancied themselves called, like the Jews of old, to \"slay and spare\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were in full career, a Virginian gentleman, who had a friend\r\nfrom the north staying with him, observed upon its being a mistaken\r\nopinion that planters were afraid of their slaves; and offered the\r\nexample of his own household as a refutation. He summoned his\r\nconfidential negro, the head of the house establishment of slaves, and\r\nbade him shut the door.\r\n\r\n\"You hear,\" said he, \"that the negroes have risen in Southampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear that they have killed several families, and that they are\r\ncoming this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that, if they come here, I shall have to depend upon you all\r\nto protect my family.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave was silent.\r\n\r\n\"If I give you arms, you will protect me and my family, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean, that if the Southampton negroes come this way, you will\r\njoin them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he went out of the room, his master wept without restraint. He\r\nowned that all his hope, all his confidence was gone. Yet, who ever\r\ndeserved confidence more than the man who spoke that last \"No\" and\r\n\"Yes?\" The more confidence in the man, the less in the system. This is\r\nthe philosophy of the story.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the fact that no insurrections have for a long time\r\ntaken place. In some parts of the slave regions, the effect has been to\r\nrelax the laws relating to slaves; and such relaxation was always\r\npointed out to me as an indication that slavery would go out of itself,\r\nif it were let alone. In other parts, new and very severe laws were\r\nbeing passed against the slaves; and this was pointed out to me as a\r\nsign that the condition of the negro was aggravated by the interference\r\nof his friends; and that his best chance lay in slavery being let alone.\r\nThus the opposite facts were made to yield the same conclusion. A friend\r\nof mine, a slave-holder, observed to me, that both the relaxation and\r\nthe aggravation of restrictions upon slaves were an indication of the\r\ntendency of public opinion: the first being done in sympathy with it,\r\nthe other in fear of it.\r\n\r\nThere was an outcry, very vehement, and very general among the friends\r\nof slavery, in both north and south, against the cruelty of\r\nabolitionists in becoming the occasion of the laws against slaves being\r\nmade more severe. In my opinion, this affords no argument against\r\nabolition, even if the condition of the slaves of to-day were aggravated\r\nby the stir of opinion. The negroes of the next generation are not to be\r\ndoomed to slavery for fear of somewhat more being inflicted on their\r\nparents: and, severe as the laws already are, the consequence of\r\nstraining them tighter still would be that they would burst. But the\r\nfact is, that so far from the condition of the slave being made worse by\r\nthe efforts of his distant friends, it has been substantially improved.\r\nI could speak confidently of this as a necessary consequence of the\r\nvalue set upon opinion by the masters; but I know it also from what I\r\nmyself saw; and from the lips of many slave-holders. The slaves of South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, have less liberty of\r\ncommunication with each other; they are deprived of the few means of\r\ninstruction that they had; they are shut in earlier in the evening, and\r\nprecluded from supping and dancing for half the night, as they used to\r\ndo; but they are substantially better treated; they are less worked by\r\nhard masters; less flogged; better fed and clothed. The eyes of the\r\nworld are now upon the American slave and his master: the kind master\r\ngoes on as he did before: the hard master dares not be so unkind as\r\nformerly. He hates his slave more than ever, for slavery is more\r\ntroublesome than ever; but he is kept in order, by the opinion of the\r\nworld abroad and the neighbours around; and he dares not vent his hatred\r\non his human property, as he once could. A slave-holder declared in\r\nCongress, that the slaves of the south knew that Dr. Channing had\r\nwritten a book on their behalf. No doubt. The tidings of the far-off\r\nmovement in their favour come to them on every wind that blows, calming\r\ntheir desperation, breathing hope into their souls; making the best of\r\ntheir masters thoughtful and sad, and the worst, desperate and cruel,\r\nthough kept within bounds by fear.\r\n\r\nThe word 'hatred' is not too strong for the feeling of a large\r\nproportion of slave-holders towards particular slaves; or, as they would\r\ncall them, (the word 'slave' never being heard in the south,) their\r\n'force,' their 'hands,' their 'negroes,' their 'people.' I was\r\nfrequently told of the 'endearing relation' subsisting between master\r\nand slaves; but, at the best, it appeared to me the same 'endearing\r\nrelation' which subsists between a man and his horse, between a lady and\r\nher dog. As long as the slave remains ignorant, docile, and contented,\r\nhe is taken good care of, humoured, and spoken of with a contemptuous,\r\ncompassionate kindness. But, from the moment he exhibits the attributes\r\nof a rational being,--from the moment his intellect seems likely to come\r\ninto the most distant competition with that of whites, the most, deadly\r\nhatred springs up;--not in the black, but in his oppressors. It is a\r\nvery old truth that we hate those whom we have injured. Never was it\r\nmore clear than in this case. I had, from time to time in my life,\r\nwitnessed something of human malice; I had seen some of the worst\r\naspects of domestic service in England; of village scandal; of political\r\nrivalship; and other circumstances provocative of the worst passions;\r\nbut pure, unmitigated hatred, the expression of which in eye and voice\r\nmakes one's blood run cold, I never witnessed till I became acquainted\r\nwith the blacks of America, their friends and oppressors: the blacks and\r\ntheir friends the objects; their oppressors the far more unhappy\r\nsubjects. It so happens that the most remarkable instances of this that\r\nI met with were clergymen and ladies. The cold livid hatred which\r\ndeformed, like a mask, the faces of a few, while deliberately\r\nslandering, now the coloured race, and now the abolitionists, could\r\nnever be forgotten by me, as a fearful revelation, if the whole country\r\nwere to be absolutely christianized to-morrow. Mr. Madison told me, that\r\nif he could work a miracle, he knew what it should be. He would make all\r\nthe blacks white; and then he could do away with slavery in twenty-four\r\nhours. So true it is that all the torturing associations of injury have\r\nbecome so connected with colour, that an institution which hurts\r\neverybody and benefits none, which all rational people who understand it\r\ndislike, despise, and suffer under, can with difficulty be abolished,\r\nbecause of the hatred which is borne to an irremovable badge.\r\n\r\nThis hatred is a sign of the times; and so are the alleged causes of it;\r\nboth are from their nature so manifestly temporary. The principal cause\r\nalleged is the impossibility of giving people of colour any idea of\r\nduty, from their want of natural affection. I was told in the same\r\nbreath of their attachment to their masters, and devotion to them in\r\nsickness; and of their utter want of all affection to their parents and\r\nchildren, husbands and wives. For \"people of colour,\" read \"slaves,\" and\r\nthe account is often correct. It is true that slaves will often leave\r\ntheir infants to perish, rather than take any trouble about them; that\r\nthey will utterly neglect a sick parent or husband; while they will\r\nnurse a white mistress with much ostentation. The reason is obvious.\r\nSuch beings are degraded so far below humanity that they will take\r\ntrouble, for the sake of praise or more solid reward, after they have\r\nbecome dead to all but grossly selfish inducements. Circumstances will\r\nfully account for a great number of cases of this sort: but to set\r\nagainst these, there are perhaps yet more instances of domestic\r\ndevotion, not to be surpassed in the annals of humanity. Of these I know\r\nmore than I can here set down; partly from their number, and partly from\r\nthe fear of exposing to injury the individuals alluded to.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine was well acquainted at Washington with a woman who had\r\nbeen a slave; and who, after gaining her liberty, worked incessantly for\r\nmany years, denying herself all but absolute necessaries, in order to\r\nredeem her husband and children. She was a sick-nurse, when my friend\r\nknew her; and, by her merits, obtained good pay. She had first bought\r\nherself; having earned, by extra toil, three or four hundred dollars.\r\nShe then earned the same sum, and redeemed her husband; and had bought\r\nthree, out of her five, children when my friend last saw her. She made\r\nno boast of her industry and self-denial. Her story was extracted from\r\nher by questions; and she obviously felt that she was doing what was\r\nmerely unavoidable. It is impossible to help instituting a comparison\r\nbetween this woman and the gentlemen who, by their own licentiousness,\r\nincrease the number of slave children whom they sell in the market. My\r\nfriend formerly carried an annual present from a distant part of the\r\ncountry to this poor woman: but it is not known what has become of her,\r\nand whether she died before she had completed her object, of freeing all\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nThere is a woman now living with a lady in Boston, requiring high wages,\r\nwhich her superior services, as well as her story, enable her to\r\ncommand. This woman was a slave, and was married to a slave, by whom she\r\nhad two children. The husband and wife were much attached. One day, her\r\nhusband was suddenly sold away to a distance; and her master, whose\r\nobject was to increase his stock as fast as possible, immediately\r\nrequired her to take another husband. She stoutly refused. Her master\r\nthought her so far worthy of being humoured, that he gave her his\r\nson,--forced him upon her, as her present feelings show. She had two\r\nmore children, of much lighter complexion than the former. When the son\r\nleft the estate, her master tried again to force a negro husband upon\r\nher. In desperation, she fled, carrying one of her first children with\r\nher. She is now working to redeem the other, a girl; and she has not\r\ngiven up all hope of recovering her husband. She was asked whether she\r\nthought of doing anything for her two mulatto children. She replied\r\nthat, to be sure, they _were_ her children; but that she did not think\r\nshe ever _could_ tell her husband that she had had those two children.\r\nIf this be not chastity, what is? Where are all the fairest natural\r\naffections, if not in these women?\r\n\r\nAt a very disorderly hotel in South Carolina, we were waited upon by a\r\nbeautiful mulatto woman and her child, a pretty girl of about eight. The\r\nwoman entreated that we would buy her child. On her being questioned,\r\nit appeared that it was \"a bad place\" in which she was: that she had got\r\nher two older children sold away, to a better place; and now, her only\r\nwish was for this child to be saved. On being asked whether she really\r\ndesired to be parted from her only remaining child, so as never to see\r\nher again, she replied that \"it would be hard to part,\" but for the\r\nchild's sake she did wish that we would buy her.\r\n\r\nA kind-hearted gentleman in the south, finding that the laws of his\r\nState precluded his teaching his legacy of slaves according to the usual\r\nmethods of education, bethought himself, at length, of the moral\r\ntraining of task-work. It succeeded admirably. His negroes soon began to\r\nwork as slaves are never, under any other arrangement, seen to work.\r\nTheir day's task was finished by eleven o'clock. Next, they began to\r\ncare for one another: the strong began to help the weak:--first,\r\nhusbands helped their wives; then parents helped their children; and, at\r\nlength, the young began to help the old. Here was seen the awakening of\r\nnatural affections which had lain in a dark sleep.\r\n\r\nOf the few methods of education which have been tried, none have\r\nsucceeded so well as this task-work. As its general adoption might have\r\nthe effect of enabling slavery to subsist longer than it otherwise\r\ncould, perhaps it is well that it can be employed only to a very small\r\nextent. Much of the work on the plantations cannot be divided into\r\ntasks. Where it can, it is wise in the masters to avail themselves of\r\nthis means of enlisting the will of the slave in behalf of his work.\r\n\r\nNo other mode of teaching serves this purpose in any degree. The\r\nshutting up of the schools, when I was in the south, struck me as a sign\r\nof the times,--a favourable sign, in as far as it showed the crisis to\r\nbe near; and it gave me little regret on account of the slave children.\r\nReading and writing even (which are never allowed) would be of no use to\r\nbeings without minds,--as slaves are prior to experience of life; and\r\nreligious teaching is worse than useless to beings who, having no\r\nrights, can have no duties. Their whole notion of religion is of power\r\nand show, as regards God; of subjection to a new sort of reward and\r\npunishment, as regards themselves; and invisible reward and punishment\r\nhave no effect on them. A negro, conducting worship, was heard to pray\r\nthus; and broad as the expressions are, they are better than an abject,\r\nunintelligent adoption of the devotional language of whites. \"Come down,\r\nO Lord, come down,--on your great white horse, a kickin' and snortin'.\"\r\nAn ordinary negro's highest idea of majesty is of riding a prancing\r\nwhite horse. As for their own concern in religion, I know of a \"force\"\r\nwhere a preacher had just made a strong impression. The slaves had given\r\nup dancing, and sang nothing but psalms: they exhibited the most\r\nludicrous spiritual pride, and discharged their business more lazily\r\nthan ever, taunting their mistress with, \"You no holy. We be holy. You\r\nno in state o' salvation.\" Such was the effect upon the majority. Here\r\nis the effect upon a stronger head.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" said his master, \"you do as badly as ever. You steal and tell\r\nlies. Don't you know you will be punished in hell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, massa, I been thinking 'bout that. I been thinking when Harry's\r\nhead is in the ground, there'll be no more Harry,--no more Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the clergyman, and other people who know better than you, tell you\r\nthat if you steal you will go to hell, and be punished there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been thinking 'bout that too. Gentlemen _be_ wise, and so they tell us\r\n'bout being punished, that we may not steal their things here: and then\r\nwe go and find out afterwards how it is.\" Such is the effect of\r\nreligion upon those who have no rights, and therefore no duties. Great\r\nefforts are being now made by the clergy of four denominations[22] to\r\nobtain converts in the south. The fact, pointed out to me by Mr.\r\nMadison, that the \"chivalrous\" south is growing strict, while the\r\npuritanic north is growing genial, is a very remarkable sign of the\r\ntimes, as it regards slavery. All sanctions of the institution being now\r\nwanted, religious sanctions are invoked among others. The scene has been\r\nacted before, often enough to make the catastrophe clearly discernible.\r\nThere are no true religious sanctions of slavery. There will be no lack\r\nof Harrys to detect the forgeries put forth as such: and, under the most\r\ncorrupt presentments of religion, there lives something of its genuine\r\nspirit,--enough to expand, sooner or later, and explode the institution\r\nwith which it can never combine. Though I found that the divines of the\r\nfour denominations were teaching a compromising Christianity, to\r\npropitiate the masters, and gross superstitions to beguile the\r\nslaves,--vying with each other in the latter respect, that they might\r\noutstrip one another in the number of their converts,--I rejoiced in\r\ntheir work. Anything is better for the slaves than apathetic subjection;\r\nand, under all this falsification, enough Christian truth has already\r\ncome in to blow slavery to atoms.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of slave-holders was most explicit as to no moral\r\nimprovement having taken place, in consequence of the introduction of\r\nreligion. There was less singing and dancing; but as much lying,\r\ndrinking, and stealing as ever: less docility, and a vanity even\r\ntranscending the common vanity of slaves,--to whom the opinion of others\r\nis all which they have to gain or lose. The houses are as dirty as ever,\r\n(and I never saw a clean room or bed but once, within the boundaries of\r\nthe slave States;) the family are still contented with their \"clean\r\nlinen, as long as it does not smell badly.\" A new set of images has been\r\npresented to the slaves; but there still remains but one idea, by and\r\nfor which any of them live; the idea of freedom.\r\n\r\nNot for this, however, is the present zeal for religion a less\r\nremarkable sign of the times.\r\n\r\nAnother is, a proposition lately made in Charleston to remove the\r\nslave-market further from public observation. This acknowledgment, in\r\nsuch a place, that there is something distasteful, or otherwise\r\nuncomfortable, in the sale of human beings, is portentous. I was in that\r\nCharleston slave-market; and saw the sale of a woman with her children.\r\nA person present voluntarily assured me that there was nothing whatever\r\npainful in the sight. It appears, however, that the rest of Charleston\r\nthinks differently.\r\n\r\nI was witness to the occasional discussion of the question whether\r\nCongress has power to prohibit the internal slave trade; and found that\r\nsome very eminent men had no doubt whatever of such power being\r\npossessed by Congress, through the clause which authorises it to\r\n\"regulate commerce among the several States.\" Among those who held this\r\nopinion were Mr. Madison and Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of the suffrage in the north, compared with the\r\nsouth, affords an indication of some speedy change of circumstances.\r\nThree fifths of the slave population is represented; but this basis of\r\nrepresentation is so narrow in contrast with that of the populous States\r\nwhere every man has the suffrage, that the south must decrease and the\r\nnorth increase, in a way which cannot long be borne by the former. The\r\nsouth has no remedy but in abolishing the institution by which her\r\nprosperity is injured, and her population comparatively confined. She\r\nsees how it is in the two contiguous States of Missouri and Illinois:\r\nthat new settlers examine Illinois, pass on into Missouri, where land is\r\nmuch cheaper, and return to Illinois to settle, because there is no\r\nslavery there: so that the population is advancing incalculably faster\r\nin Illinois than in Missouri. Missouri will soon and easily find her\r\nremedy, in abolishing slavery; when the whites will rush in, as they now\r\ndo into the neighbouring States. In the south, the case is more\r\ndifficult. It will be long before white labour becomes so reputable\r\nthere as elsewhere; and the present white residents cannot endure the\r\nidea of the suffrage being freely given, within any assignable time, to\r\nthose who are now their slaves, or to their dusky descendants. Yet this\r\nis what must be done, sooner or later, with more or fewer precautions,\r\nif the south means to hold an important rank in Congress. It is in\r\ncontemplation of this difficulty that the loudest threats are heard of\r\nsecession from the Union; a movement which, as I have before said, would\r\nbe immediately prevented, or signally punished. The abolition of slavery\r\nis the only resource.\r\n\r\nUpon the most remarkable of all the signs of the times relating to\r\nslavery, it is not necessary to say much. Those which I have mentioned\r\nare surely enough to show, as plainly as if a ghost had come from the\r\ngrave to tell us, that the time is at hand for the destruction of this\r\nmonstrous anomaly. What the issue of the coming change will be is, to my\r\nmind, decided by a consideration on which almost every man is\r\nvociferating his opinion,--the character of the abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough why this point is discussed so widely and so\r\nconstantly, that I think I may say I heard more upon it, while I was in\r\nAmerica, than upon all other American matters together. It is clearly\r\nconvenient to throw so weighty a question as that of abolition back upon\r\nthe aggregate characters of those who propose it; convenient to\r\nslave-holders, convenient to those in the north whose sympathies are\r\nwith slave-holders, or who dread change, or who want an excuse to\r\nthemselves for not acting upon the principles which all profess. The\r\ncharacter of the abolitionists of the United States has been the object\r\nof attack for some years,--of daily and hourly attack; and, as far as I\r\nknow, there has been no defence; for the plain reason that this is a\r\nquestion on which there can be no middle party. All who are not with the\r\nabolitionists are against them; for silence and inaction are public\r\nacquiescence in things as they are. The case is, then, that everybody is\r\nagainst them but their own body, whose testimony would, of course, go\r\nfor nothing, if it were offered; which it never is.--I know many of them\r\nwell; as every stranger in the country ought to take pains to do. I\r\nfirst heard everything that could be said against them: and afterwards\r\nbecame well acquainted with a great number of them.\r\n\r\nI think the abolitionists of the United States the most reasonable set\r\nof people that I ever knew to be united together for one object. Among\r\nthem may be enjoyed the high and rare luxury of having a reason rendered\r\nfor every act performed, and every opinion maintained. The treatment\r\nthey have met with compels them to be more thoroughly informed, and more\r\ncompletely assured on every point on which they commit themselves, than\r\nis commonly considered necessary on the right side of a question, where\r\nthere is the strength of a mighty principle to repose upon. The\r\ncommonest charge against them is that they are fanatical. I think them,\r\ngenerally speaking, the most clear-headed, right-minded class I ever\r\nhad intercourse with. Their accuracy about dates, numbers, and all such\r\nmatters of fact, is as remarkable as their clear perception of the\r\nprinciples on which they proceed. They are, however, remarkably\r\ndeficient in policy,--in party address. They are artless to a fault; and\r\nprobably, no party, religious, political, or benevolent, in their\r\ncountry, ever was formed and conducted with so little dexterity,\r\nshrewdness, and concert. Noble and imperishable as their object is, it\r\nwould probably, from this cause, have slipped through their fingers for\r\nthe present, if it had not been for some other qualities common among\r\nthem. It is needless to say much of their heroism; of the strength of\r\nsoul with which they await and endure the inflictions with which they\r\nare visited, day by day. Their position indicates all this. Animating as\r\nit is to witness, it is less touching than the qualities to which they\r\nowe the success which would otherwise have been forfeited through their\r\nwant of address and party organisation. A spirit of meekness, of mutual\r\nforbearance, of mutual reverence, runs through the whole body; and by\r\nthis are selfish considerations put aside, differences composed, and\r\ndistrusts obviated, to a degree which I never hoped to witness among a\r\nsociety as various as the sects, parties and opinions which are the\r\nelements of the whole community. With the gaiety of heart belonging to\r\nthose who have cast aside every weight; with the strength of soul proper\r\nto those who walk by faith; with the child-like unconsciousness of the\r\ninnocent; living from hour to hour in the light of that greatest of all\r\npurposes,--to achieve a distant object by the fulfilment of the nearest\r\nduty,--and therefore rooting out from among themselves all aristocratic\r\ntendencies and usages, rarely speaking of their own sufferings and\r\nsacrifices, but in honour preferring one another, how can they fail to\r\nwin over the heart of society,--that great heart, sympathising with all\r\nthat is lofty and true?[23]\r\n\r\nAs was said to me, \"the Searcher of hearts is passing through the land,\r\nand every one must come forth to the ordeal.\" This Searcher of hearts\r\ncomes now in the form of the mighty principle of human freedom. If a\r\nglance is cast over the assemblage called to the ordeal, how mean and\r\ntrivial are the vociferations in defence of property, the threats of\r\nrevenge for light, the boast of physical force, the appeal to the\r\ncompromises which constitute the defects of human law! How low and how\r\nsad appear the mercenary interests, the social fears, the clerical\r\nblindness or cowardice, the morbid fastidiousness of those who,\r\nprofessing the same principles with the abolitionists, are bent upon\r\nkeeping those principles for ever an abstraction! How inspiring is it to\r\nsee that the community is, notwithstanding all this, sound at the core,\r\nand that the soundness is spreading so fast that the health of the whole\r\ncommunity may be ultimately looked for! When a glance shows us all this,\r\nand that the abolitionists are no more elated by their present success\r\nthan they were depressed by their almost hopeless degradation, we may\r\nfairly consider the character of the abolitionists a decisive sign of\r\nthe times,--a peculiarly distinct prophecy that the coloured race will\r\nsoon pass from under the yoke. The Searcher of hearts brings prophecies\r\nin his hand, which those who will may read.[24]\r\n\r\nI cannot give much space to the theories which are current as to what\r\nthe issue will be if the abolition of slavery should not take place. To\r\nme it seems pretty clear, when the great amount of the mulatto\r\npopulation is considered. Within an almost calculable time, the\r\npopulation would be wholly mulatto; and the southern States would be in\r\na condition so far inferior to the northern, that they would probably\r\nseparate, and live under a different form of government. A military\r\ndespotism might probably be established when the mixture of colours had\r\nbecome inconvenient, without being universal: slavery would afterwards\r\ndie out, through the general degradation of society; and then the\r\ncommunity would begin again to rise, from a very low point. But it will\r\nbe seen that I do not anticipate that there will be room or time for\r\nthis set of circumstances to take place. I say this in the knowledge of\r\nthe fact that a very perceptible tinge of negro blood is visible in some\r\nof the first families of Louisiana; a fact learned from residents of\r\nhigh quality on the spot.\r\n\r\nHow stands the case, finally?--A large proportion of the labour of the\r\nUnited States is held on principles wholly irreconcilable with the\r\nprinciples of the constitution: whatever may be true about its origin,\r\nit is now inefficient, wasteful, destructive, to a degree which must\r\nsoon cause a change of plan: some who see the necessity of such a\r\nchange, are in favour of reversing the original policy;--slavery having\r\nonce been begun in order to till the land, they are now for usurping a\r\nnew territory in order to employ their slaves: others are for banishing\r\nthe labour which is the one thing most needful to their country, in\r\nevery way. While all this confusion and mismanagement exist, here is the\r\nlabour, actually on the land, ready to be employed to better purpose;\r\nand in the treasury are the funds by which the transmutation of slave\r\ninto free labour might be effected,--at once in the District of\r\nColumbia; and by subsequent arrangements in the slave States. Many\r\nmatters of detail would have to be settled: the distribution would be\r\ndifficult; but it is not impossible. Virginia, whose revenue is derived\r\nfrom the rearing of slaves for the south, whose property is the beings\r\nthemselves, and not their labour, must, in justice, receive a larger\r\ncompensation than such States as Alabama and Louisiana, where the labour\r\nis the wealth, and which would be therefore immediately enriched by the\r\nimprovement in the quality of the labour which would follow upon\r\nemancipation. Such arrangements may be difficult to make; but \"when\r\nthere's a will there's a way;\" and when it is generally perceived that\r\nthe abolition of slavery must take place, the great principle will not\r\nlong be allowed to lie in fetters of detail. The Americans have done\r\nmore difficult things than this; though assuredly none greater. The\r\nrestoration of two millions and a half of people to their human rights\r\nwill be as great a deed as the history of the world will probably ever\r\nhave to exhibit. In none of its pages are there names more lustrous than\r\nthose of the clear-eyed and fiery-hearted few who began and are\r\nachieving the virtuous revolution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] I might add their matter-of-fact credulity, strongly resembling\r\nromance. As a specimen of the _quizzing_ common with regard to the\r\nGermans, I give an anecdote. At the time when the struggle between Adams\r\nand Jackson was very close, a supporter of Adams complained to Mr. W.\r\nthat it was provoking that somebody had persuaded the Germans in\r\nPennsylvania that Mr. Adams had married a daughter of George III.; a\r\nreport which would cost him all their votes. Mr. W. said, \"Why do not\r\nyou contradict it?\" \"O,\" replied his friend, \"you know nothing of those\r\npeople. They will believe everything, and unbelieve nothing. No: instead\r\nof contradicting the report, we must allow that Adams married a daughter\r\nof George III.; but add that Jackson married two.\"\r\n\r\n[13] I heard some interesting facts about the Germans in Pennsylvania\r\nfrom Mr. Gallatin, who lived among them for some time. A fact regarding\r\nthis gentleman shows what the obscurity of country life in the United\r\nStates may be. His estate was originally in Virginia. By a new division,\r\nit was thrown into the back of Pennsylvania. He ceased to be heard of,\r\nfor some years, in the interval of his engaging in public affairs.\r\nDuring this time, an advertisement appeared in a newspaper, asking for\r\ntidings of \"one Albert Gallatin\" and adding that if he were still\r\nliving, he might, on making a certain application, hear of something to\r\nhis advantage.\r\n\r\n[14] I need hardly mention that I read \"England and America\" before I\r\nset out on my travels. It will appear that I am under obligations to\r\nthat valuable work for much guidance.\r\n\r\n[15] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[16] The Texans pretend to deny that the slave-trade will receive, or is\r\nreceiving, an impulse from them. The case is this. In the Texan\r\nconstitution, the importation of slaves, _except from the United\r\nStates_, is declared piracy. A most wealthy slave-owner of Louisiana\r\ntold me, in 1835, that the annual importation of native Africans (by\r\nsmuggling) was from thirteen thousand to fifteen thousand. This has much\r\nincreased since. As long as there is a market for slaves, there will be\r\nthe slave-trade, though there were a preventive cruiser to every mile of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nAn official gentleman, from the British West Indies, informed me that\r\nmuch mischief has ensued from the withdrawing of two or three small\r\nBritish schooners, which used to cruise about the islands, and were\r\nbroken up on the plea of economy;--it being supposed that vessels so\r\nsmall could do no good which would compensate for their expense. This is\r\na mistake. If a slave ship surrenders on summons, the ship and cargo are\r\nforfeited, and that is all. If a gun is fired, in defence, the captain\r\nand crew become thereby liable to be hanged as pirates. Of course, those\r\nwho man a slave ship are ready to surrender to a cock-boat, with two men\r\nin it, rather than become liable to hanging for property in which they\r\ncan have, at most, but a very small interest. Thus a schooner renders as\r\ngood aid, and is as much an object of dread, in this kind of service, as\r\na larger vessel.\r\n\r\n[17] England and America.\r\n\r\n[18] It may surprise some that I speak of those who are blind to slavery\r\nbeing an anomaly in economy as 'few.' Among the many hundreds of persons\r\nin the slave States, with whom I conversed on the subject of slavery, I\r\nmet with only one, a lady, who defended the institution altogether: and\r\nwith perhaps four or five who defended it as necessary to a purpose\r\nwhich must be fulfilled, and could not be fulfilled otherwise. All the\r\nrest who vindicated its present existence did so on the ground of the\r\nimpossibility of doing it away. A very large number avowed that it was\r\nindefensible in every point of view.\r\n\r\n[19] With the condition of the African colony, we have here nothing to\r\ndo. We are now considering the Colonisation Society in its professed\r\nrelation to American slavery.\r\n\r\n[20] Governor M'Duffie's message to the legislature of South Carolina\r\ncontains the proposition that freedom can be preserved only in societies\r\nwhere either work is disreputable, or there is an hereditary\r\naristocracy, or a military despotism. He prefers the first, as being the\r\nmost republican.\r\n\r\n[21] The dispute between the abolitionists and their adversaries is\r\nalways made to turn on the point of distinction between freedom of\r\ndiscussion and political interference. With the views now entertained by\r\nthe south, she can never be satisfied on this head. She requires nothing\r\nshort of a dead silence upon the subject of human rights. This demand is\r\nmade by her state governors of the state governors of the north. It\r\nwill, of course, never be granted. The course of the abolitionists seems\r\nto themselves clear enough; and they act accordingly. They labour\r\n_politically_ only with regard to the District of Columbia, over which\r\nCongress holds exclusive jurisdiction. Their other endeavour is to\r\npromote the discussion of the moral question throughout the free States.\r\nThey use no direct means to this end in the slave States;--in the first\r\nplace, because they have no power to do so; and in the next, because the\r\nrequisite movement there is sure to follow upon that in the north. It is\r\nwholly untrue that they insinuate their publications into the south.\r\nTheir only political transgression (and who will call it a moral one?)\r\nis, helping fugitive slaves. The line between free discussion and\r\npolitical interference has never yet been drawn to the satisfaction of\r\nboth parties, and never will be.\r\n\r\n[22] Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists and Baptists.\r\n\r\n[23] It may, at the first glance, appear improbable that such a\r\ncharacter as this should belong to any collection of individuals. But\r\nlet it be remembered what the object is; an object which selects for its\r\nfirst supporters the choicest spirits of society. These choice spirits,\r\nagain, are disciplined by what they have to undergo for their object,\r\ntill they come out such as I have described them. Their's is not a\r\ncommon charitable institution, whose committees meet, and do creditable\r\nbusiness, and depart homewards in peace. They are the confessors of the\r\nmartyr-age of America. As a matter of course, their character will be\r\nless distinctive as their numbers increase. Many are coming in, and more\r\nwill come in, who had not strength, or light, or warmth enough to join\r\nthem in the days of their insignificance.\r\n\r\n[24] While I write, confirmation comes in the shape of Governor\r\nM'Duffie's message to the legislature of South Carolina, in which he\r\nspeaks of the vast and accelerated spread of abolition principles; of\r\nthe probability that slavery in the District of Columbia will be soon\r\nabolished; and of the pressing occasion that thence arises for South\r\nCarolina to resolve what she shall do, rather than part with her\r\ndomestic institutions. He recommends her to declare her intention of\r\npeaceably withdrawing from the Union, in such a case. Time will show\r\nwhether the majority of her citizens will prefer sacrificing their\r\nconnexion with the Union, or their slavery; whether the separation will\r\nbe allowed by the other States to take place; or, if it be, whether\r\nSouth Carolina will not speedily desire a readmission.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
