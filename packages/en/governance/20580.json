It was about four in the afternoon,\r\nit was growing dark, and the immense hall of the Assembly having become\r\ninvolved in gloom, the chandeliers were lowered from the ceiling, and\r\nthe messengers placed lamps on the tribune. The President made a sign,\r\nthe door on the right opened, and there was seen to enter the hall, and\r\nrapidly ascend the tribune, a man still young, attired in black, having\r\non his breast the badge and riband of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards this man. A pallid face, its bony\r\nemaciated angles thrown into bold relief by the shaded lamps, a nose\r\nlarge and long, moustaches, a curled lock of hair above a narrow\r\nforehead, eyes small and dull, and with a timid and uneasy manner,\r\nbearing no resemblance to the Emperor,--this man was Citizen\r\nCharles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nDuring the murmurs which greeted his entrance, he remained for some\r\ninstants, his right hand in the breast of his buttoned coat, erect and\r\nmotionless on the tribune, the pediment of which bore these dates:\r\nFebruary 22, 23, 24; and above which were inscribed these three words:\r\n_Liberty_, _Equality_, _Fraternity_.\r\n\r\nBefore being elected President of the Republic, Charles-Louis-Napoleon\r\nBonaparte had been a representative of the people for several months,\r\nand though he had rarely attended a whole sitting, he had been\r\nfrequently seen in the seat he had selected, on the upper benches of\r\nthe Left, in the fifth row in the zone commonly called the Mountain,\r\nbehind his old preceptor, Representative Vieillard. This man, then,\r\nwas no new figure in the Assembly, yet his entrance on this occasion\r\nproduced a profound sensation. It was to all, to his friends as to his\r\nfoes, the future that entered, an unknown future. Amid the immense\r\nmurmur, produced by the whispered words of all present, his name\r\npassed from mouth to mouth, coupled with most diverse opinions. His\r\nantagonists detailed his adventures, his _coups-de-main_, Strasburg,\r\nBoulogne, the tame eagle, and the piece of meat in the little hat. His\r\nfriends dwelt upon his exile, his proscription, his imprisonment, an\r\nexcellent work of his on the artillery, his writings at Ham, which\r\nwere marked, to a certain degree, with the liberal, democratic, and\r\nsocialistic spirit, the maturity of the more sober age at which he had\r\nnow arrived; and to those who recalled his follies, they recalled his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cavaignac, who, not having been elected President, had just\r\nresigned his power into the hands of the Assembly, with that tranquil\r\nlaconism which befits republics, was seated in his customary place at\r\nthe head of the ministerial bench, on the left of the tribune, and\r\nobserved in silence, with folded arms, this installation of the new\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAt length silence was restored, the President of the Assembly struck\r\nthe table before him several times with his wooden knife, and then, the\r\nlast murmurs having subsided, said:\r\n\r\n\"I will now read the form of the oath.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something almost religious about that moment. The Assembly\r\nwas no longer an Assembly, it was a temple. The immense significance of\r\nthe oath was rendered still more impressive by the circumstance that it\r\nwas the only oath taken throughout the whole territory of the Republic.\r\nFebruary had, and rightly, abolished the political oath, and the\r\nConstitution had, as rightly, retained only the oath of the President.\r\nThis oath possessed the double character of necessity and of grandeur.\r\nIt was an oath taken by the executive, the subordinate power, to the\r\nlegislative, the superior power; it was even more than this--in\r\ncontrast to the monarchical fiction by which the people take the oath\r\nto the man invested with power, it was the man invested with power who\r\ntook the oath to the people. The President, functionary and servant,\r\nswore fidelity to the sovereign people. Bending before the national\r\nmajesty, manifest in the omnipotent Assembly, he received from the\r\nAssembly the Constitution, and swore obedience to it. The\r\nrepresentatives were inviolable, and he was not. We repeat it: a\r\ncitizen responsible to all the citizens, he was, of the whole nation,\r\nthe only man so bound. Hence, in this oath, sole and supreme, there was\r\na solemnity which went to the heart. He who writes these lines was\r\npresent in his place in the Assembly, on the day this oath was taken;\r\nhe is one of those who, in the face of the civilized world called to\r\nbear witness, received this oath in the name of the people, and who\r\nhave it still in their hands. Thus it runs:--\r\n\r\n\"In presence of God, and before the French people, represented by the\r\nNational Assembly, I swear to remain faithful to the democratic\r\nrepublic, one and indivisible, and to fulfil all the duties imposed\r\nupon me by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the Assembly, standing, read this majestic formula;\r\nthen, before the whole Assembly, breathlessly silent and attentive,\r\nintensely expectant, Citizen Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, raising\r\nhis right hand, said, in a firm, loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"I swear it!\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative Boulay (de la Meurthe), since Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic, who had known Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte from his\r\nchildhood, exclaimed: \"He is an honest man, he will keep his oath.\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the Assembly, still standing, proceeded thus (I quote\r\n_verbatim_ the words recorded in the _Moniteur_): \"We call God and man\r\nto witness the oath which has just been sworn. The National Assembly\r\nreceives that oath, orders it to be transcribed upon its records,\r\nprinted in the _Moniteur_, and published in the same manner as\r\nlegislative acts.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the ceremony was now at an end, and we imagined that\r\nCitizen Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, thenceforth, until the second\r\nSunday in May, 1852, President of the Republic, would descend from the\r\ntribune. But he did not; he felt a magnanimous impulse to bind himself\r\nstill more rigorously, if possible; to add something to the oath which\r\nthe Constitution demanded from him, in order to show how largely the\r\noath was free and spontaneous. He asked permission to address the\r\nAssembly. \"You have the floor,\" said the President of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThere was more profound silence, and closer attention than before.\r\n\r\nCitizen Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte unfolded a paper and read a speech. In\r\nthis speech, having announced and installed the ministry appointed by\r\nhim, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"I desire, in common with yourselves, citizen representatives, to\r\nconsolidate society upon its true basis, to establish democratic\r\ninstitutions, and earnestly to seek every means calculated to relieve\r\nthe sufferings of the generous and intelligent people who have just\r\nbestowed on me so signal a proof of their confidence.\"[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] \"Hear! Hear!\"--_Moniteur_.\r\n\r\nHe then thanked his predecessor in the executive power, the same man\r\nwho, later, was able to say these noble words: \"_I did not fall from\r\npower, I descended from it_;\" and he glorified him in these terms:--\r\n\r\n\"The new administration, in entering upon its duties, is bound to thank\r\nthat which preceded it for the efforts it has made to transmit the\r\nexecutive power intact, and to maintain public tranquillity.[2]\r\n\r\n      [2] \"Murmurs of assent.\"--_Moniteur_.\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of the Honourable General Cavaignac has been worthy of the\r\nmanliness of his character, and of that sentiment of duty which is the\r\nfirst quality requisite in the chief of the State.\"[3]\r\n\r\n      [3] \"Renewed murmurs of assent.\"--_Moniteur_.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly cheered these words, but that which especially struck\r\nevery mind, which was profoundly graven in every memory, which found\r\nits echo in every honest heart, was the declaration, the wholly\r\nspontaneous declaration, we repeat, with which he began his address.\r\n\r\n\"The suffrages of the nation, and the oath I have just taken, command\r\nmy future conduct. My duty is clearly marked. I will fulfil it as a man\r\nof honour.\r\n\r\n\"I shall regard as the enemies of the country all who seek to change,\r\nby illegal means, that which all France has established.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had done speaking, the Constituent Assembly rose, and uttered\r\nas with a single voice, the exclamation: \"Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nLouis-Napoleon Bonaparte descended from the tribune, went up to General\r\nCavaignac, and offered him his hand. The general, for a few instants,\r\nhesitated to accept the grasp. All who had just heard the words of\r\nLouis Bonaparte, pronounced in a tone so instinct with good faith,\r\nblamed the general for his hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution to which Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte took oath on\r\nDecember 20, 1848, \"in the face of God and man,\" contained, among other\r\narticles, these:--\r\n\r\n    \"Article 36. The representatives of the people are inviolable.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 37. They may not be arrested on a criminal charge unless\r\n    taken in the fact, or prosecuted without the permission of the\r\n    Assembly first obtained.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 68. Every act by which the President of the Republic\r\n    dissolves the National Assembly, prorogues it, or impedes the\r\n    execution of its decrees, is high treason.\r\n\r\n    \"By such act, of itself, the President forfeits his office, the\r\n    citizens are bound to refuse him obedience, and the executive power\r\n    passes, of absolute right, to the National Assembly. The judges of\r\n    the Supreme Court shall thereupon immediately assemble, under\r\n    penalty of forfeiture; they shall convoke the jurors in such place\r\n    as they shall appoint, to proceed to the trial of the President and\r\n    his accomplices; and they shall themselves appoint magistrates who\r\n    shall proceed to execute the functions of the ministry.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than three years after this memorable day, on the 2nd of\r\nDecember, 1851, at daybreak, there might be read on all the street\r\ncorners in Paris, this placard:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the name of the French people, the President of the Republic:\r\n\r\n    \"Decrees--\r\n\r\n    \"Article 1. The National Assembly is dissolved.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 2. Universal suffrage is re-established. The law of the\r\n    31st of May is repealed.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 3. The French people are convoked in their comitia.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 4. A state of siege is decreed throughout the first\r\n    military division.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 5. The Council of State is dissolved.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 6. The Minister of the Interior is charged with the\r\n    execution of this decree.\r\n\r\n    \"Done at the Palace of the Élysée, December 2, 1851.\r\n\r\n    \"LOUIS-NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Paris learned that fifteen of the inviolable\r\nrepresentatives of the people had been arrested in their homes,\r\nduring the night, by order of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMISSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who, as representatives of the people, received, in trust for the\r\npeople, the oath of the 20th of December, 1848, those, especially who,\r\nbeing twice invested with the confidence of the nation, had as\r\nrepresentatives heard that oath sworn, and as legislators had seen it\r\nviolated, had assumed, with their writ of summons, two duties. The\r\nfirst of these was, on the day when that oath should be violated, to\r\nrise in their places, to present their breasts to the enemy, without\r\ncalculating either his numbers or his strength, to shelter with their\r\nbodies the sovereignty of the people and as a means to combat and cast\r\ndown the usurper, to grasp every sort of weapon, from the law found in\r\nthe code, to the paving stone that one picks up in the street. The\r\nsecond duty was, after having accepted the combat and all its chances\r\nto accept proscription and all its miseries, to stand eternally erect\r\nbefore the traitor, his oath in their hands, to forget their personal\r\nsufferings, their private sorrows, their families dispersed and\r\nmaltreated, their fortunes destroyed, their affections crushed, their\r\nbleeding hearts; to forget themselves, and to feel thenceforth but a\r\nsingle wound--the wound of France to cry aloud for justice; never to\r\nsuffer themselves to be appeased, never to relent, but to be\r\nimplacable; to seize the despicable perjurer, crowned though he were,\r\nif not with the hand of the law, at least with the pincers of truth,\r\nand to heat red-hot in the fire of history all the letters of his oath,\r\nand brand them on his face.\r\n\r\nHe who writes these lines is one of those who did not shrink, on the\r\n2nd of December, from the utmost effort to accomplish the first of\r\nthese two great duties; in publishing this book he performs the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNOTICE OF EXPIRATION OF TERM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is time that the human conscience should awaken.\r\n\r\nEver since the 2nd of December, 1851, a successful ambush, a crime,\r\nodious, repulsive, infamous, unprecedented, considering the age in\r\nwhich it was committed, has triumphed and held sway, erecting itself\r\ninto a theory, pluming itself in the sunlight, making laws, issuing\r\ndecrees, taking society, religion, and the family under its protection,\r\nholding out its hand to the kings of Europe, who accept it, and calling\r\nthem, \"my brother,\" or \"my cousin.\" This crime no one disputes, not\r\neven those who profit by it and live by it; they say simply that it was\r\nnecessary; not even he who committed it, who says merely that he, the\r\ncriminal, has been \"absolved.\" This crime contains within itself all\r\ncrimes, treachery in the conception, perjury in the execution, murder\r\nand assassination in the struggle, spoliation, swindling, and robbery\r\nin the triumph; this crime draws after it as integral parts of itself,\r\nsuppression of the laws, violation of constitutional inviolabilities,\r\narbitrary sequestration, confiscation of property, midnight massacres,\r\nsecret military executions, commissions superseding tribunals, ten\r\nthousand citizens banished, forty thousand citizens proscribed, sixty\r\nthousand families ruined and despairing. These things are patent. Even\r\nso! it is painful to say it, but there is silence concerning this\r\ncrime; it is there, men see it, touch it, and pass on to their\r\nbusiness; shops are opened, the stock jobbers job, Commerce, seated on\r\nher packages, rubs her hands, and the moment is close at hand when\r\neverybody will regard all that has taken place as a matter of course.\r\nHe who measures cloth does not hear the yard-stick in his hand speak to\r\nhim and say: \"'Tis a false measure that governs.\" He who weighs out a\r\ncommodity does not hear his scales raise their voice and say: \"'Tis a\r\nfalse weight that reigns.\" A strange order of things surely, that has\r\nfor its base supreme disorder, the negation of all law! equilibrium\r\nresting on iniquity!\r\n\r\nLet us add,--what, for that matter is self-evident,--that the author of\r\nthis crime is a malefactor of the most cynical and lowest description.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, let all who wear a robe, a scarf, or a uniform; let all\r\nthose who serve this man, know, if they think themselves the agents of\r\na power, that they deceive themselves; they are the shipmates of a\r\npirate. Ever since the 2nd of December there have been no\r\noffice-holders in France, there have been only accomplices. The moment\r\nhas come when every one must take careful account of what he has done,\r\nof what he is continuing to do. The gendarmes who arrested those whom\r\nthe man of Strasburg and Boulogne called \"insurgents,\" arrested the\r\nguardians of the Constitution. The judge who tried the combatants of\r\nParis or the provinces, placed in the dock the mainstays of the law.\r\nThe officer who confined in the hulks the \"condemned men,\" confined the\r\ndefenders of the Republic and of the State. The general in Africa who\r\nimprisoned at Lambassa the transported men bending beneath the sun's\r\nfierce heat, shivering with fever, digging in the sun-baked soil a\r\nfurrow destined to be their grave, that general sequestrated, tortured,\r\nassassinated the men of the law. All, generals, officers, gendarmes,\r\njudges, are absolutely under forfeiture. They have before them more\r\nthan innocent men,--heroes! more than victims,--martyrs!\r\n\r\nLet them know this, therefore, and let them hasten to act upon the\r\nknowledge; let them, at least, break the fetters, draw the bolts, empty\r\nthe hulks, throw open the jails, since they have not still the courage\r\nto grasp the sword. Up, consciences, awake, it is full time!\r\n\r\nIf law, right, duty, reason, common sense, equity, justice, suffice\r\nnot, let them think of the future! If remorse is mute, let\r\nresponsibility speak!\r\n\r\nAnd let all those who, being landed proprietors, shake the magistrate\r\nby the hand; who, being bankers, fête a general; who, being peasants,\r\nsalute a gendarme; let all those who do not shun the hôtel in which\r\ndwells the minister, the house in which dwells the prefect, as he would\r\nshun a _lazaretto_; let all those who, being simple citizens, not\r\nfunctionaries, go to the balls and the banquets of Louis Bonaparte and\r\nsee not that the black flag waves over the Élysée,--let all these in\r\nlike manner know that this sort of shame is contagious; if they avoid\r\nmaterial complicity, they will not avoid moral complicity.\r\n\r\nThe crime of the 2nd of December bespatters them.\r\n\r\nThe present situation, that seems so calm to the unthinking, is most\r\nthreatening, be sure of that. When public morality is under eclipse, an\r\nappalling shadow settles down upon social order.\r\n\r\nAll guarantees take wing, all supports vanish.\r\n\r\nThenceforth there is not in France a tribunal, nor a court, nor a\r\njudge, to render justice and pronounce a sentence, on any subject,\r\nagainst any one, in the name of any one.\r\n\r\nBring before the assizes a malefactor of any sort: the thief will say\r\nto the judges: \"The chief of the State robbed the Bank of twenty-five\r\nmillions;\" the false witness will say to the judges: \"The chief of the\r\nState took an oath in the face of God and of man, and that oath he has\r\nviolated;\" the sequestrator will say: \"The chief of the State has\r\narrested, and detained against all law, the representatives of the\r\nsovereign people;\" the swindler will say: \"The chief of the State got\r\nhis election, got power, got the Tuileries, all by swindling;\" the\r\nforger will say: \"The chief of the State forged votes;\" the footpad\r\nwill say: \"The chief of the State stole their purses from the Princes\r\nof Orleans;\" the murderer will say: \"The chief of the State shot,\r\nsabred, bayonetted, massacred passengers in the streets;\" and all\r\ntogether, swindler, forger, false witness, footpad, robber, assassin,\r\nwill add: \"And you judges, you have been to salute this man, to praise\r\nhim for having perjured himself, to compliment him for committing\r\nforgery, to praise him for stealing and swindling, to thank him for\r\nmurdering! what do you want of us?\"\r\n\r\nAssuredly, this is a very serious state of things! to sleep in such a\r\nsituation, is additional ignominy.\r\n\r\nIt is time, we repeat, that this monstrous slumber of men's consciences\r\nshould end. It must not be, after that fearful scandal, the triumph of\r\ncrime, that a scandal still more fearful should be presented to\r\nmankind: the indifference of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIf that were to be, history would appear one day as an avenger; and\r\nfrom this very hour, as the wounded lion takes refuge in the solitudes,\r\nthe just man, veiling his face in presence of this universal\r\ndegradation, would take refuge in the immensity of public contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMEN WILL AWAKEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be; men will awaken.\r\n\r\nThe present book has for its sole aim to arouse the sleepers. France\r\nmust not even adhere to this government with the assent of lethargy; at\r\ncertain hours, in certain places, under certain shadows, to sleep is to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nLet us add that at this moment, France--strange to say, but none the\r\nless true--knows not what took place on the 2nd of December and\r\nsubsequently, or knows it imperfectly; and this is her excuse. However,\r\nthanks to several generous and courageous publications, the facts are\r\nbeginning to creep out. This book is intended to bring some of those\r\nfacts forward, and, if it please God, to present them in their true\r\nlight. It is important that people should know who and what this M.\r\nBonaparte is. At the present moment, thanks to the suppression of the\r\nplatform, thanks to the suppression of the press, thanks to the\r\nsuppression of speech, of liberty, and of truth,--a suppression which\r\nhas had for one result the permitting M. Bonaparte to do everything,\r\nbut which has had at the same time the effect of nullifying all his\r\nmeasures without exception, including the indescribable ballot of the\r\n20th of December,--thanks, we say, to this stifling of all complaints\r\nand of all light, no man, no fact wears its true aspect or bears its\r\ntrue name. M. Bonaparte's crime is not a crime, it is called a\r\nnecessity; M. Bonaparte's ambuscade is not an ambuscade, it is called a\r\ndefence of public order; M. Bonaparte's robberies are not robberies,\r\nthey are called measures of state; M. Bonaparte's murders are not\r\nmurders, they are called public safety; M. Bonaparte's accomplices are\r\nnot malefactors, they are called magistrates, senators, and councillors\r\nof state; M. Bonaparte's adversaries are not the soldiers of the law\r\nand of right, they are called Jacquerie, demagogues, communists. In the\r\neyes of France, in the eyes of Europe, the 2nd of December is still\r\nmasked. This book is a hand issuing from the darkness, and tearing that\r\nmask away.\r\n\r\nNow, we propose to scrutinize this triumph of order, to depict this\r\ngovernment so vigorous, so firm, so well-based, so strong, having on\r\nits side a crowd of paltry youths, who have more ambition than boots,\r\ndandies and beggars; sustained on the Bourse by Fould the Jew, and in\r\nthe Church by Montalembert the Catholic; esteemed by women who would\r\nfain pass for maids, by men who want to be prefects; resting on a\r\ncoalition of prostitutions; giving fêtes; making cardinals; wearing\r\nwhite neck-cloths and yellow kid gloves, like Morny, newly varnished\r\nlike Maupas, freshly brushed like Persigny,--rich, elegant, clean,\r\ngilded, joyous, and born in a pool of blood!\r\n\r\nYes, men will awaken!\r\n\r\nYes, men will arouse from that torpor which, to such a people, is\r\nshame; and when France does awaken, when she does open her eyes, when\r\nshe does distinguish, when she does see that which is before her and\r\nbeside her, she will recoil with a terrible shudder from the monstrous\r\ncrime which dared to espouse her in the darkness, and of which she has\r\nshared the bed.\r\n\r\nThen will the supreme hour strike!\r\n\r\nThe sceptics smile and insist; they say:\r\n\r\n\"Hope for nothing. This government, you say, is the shame of France. Be\r\nit so, but this same shame is quoted on the Bourse. Hope for nothing.\r\nYou are poets and dreamers if you hope. Why, look about you: the\r\ntribune, the press, intelligence, speech, thought, all that was\r\nliberty, has vanished. Yesterday, these things were in motion, alive;\r\nto-day, they are petrified. Well, people are satisfied with this\r\npetrification, they accommodate themselves to it, make the most of it,\r\nconduct business on it, and live as usual. Society goes on, and plenty\r\nof worthy folk are well pleased with this state of things. Why do you\r\nwant to change it, to put an end to it? Don't deceive yourselves, it is\r\nall solid, all firm; it is the present and the future.\"\r\n\r\nWe are in Russia. The Neva is frozen over. Houses are built on the ice,\r\nand heavy chariots roll over it. It is no longer water, but rock. The\r\npeople go to and fro upon this marble which was once a river. A town is\r\nrun up, streets are marked out, shops opened; people buy, sell, eat,\r\ndrink, sleep, light fires on what once was water. You can do whatever\r\nyou please there. Fear nothing. Laugh, dance; it is more solid than\r\n_terra firma_. Why, it rings beneath the foot, like granite. Long\r\nlive winter! Long live the ice! This will last till doomsday! And look\r\nat the sky: is it day? is it night? what is it? A pale, misty light\r\nsteals over the snow; one would say that the sun is dying!\r\n\r\nNo, thou art not dying, O liberty! One of these days, at the moment\r\nwhen thou art least expected, at the very hour when they shall have\r\nmost utterly forgotten thee, thou wilt rise!--O dazzling vision! the\r\nstar-like face will suddenly be seen issuing from the earth,\r\nresplendent on the horizon! Over all that snow, over all that ice, over\r\nthat hard, white plain, over that water become rock, over all that\r\nwretched winter, thou wilt cast thy arrow of gold, thy ardent and\r\neffulgent ray! light, heat, life! And then, listen! hear you that dull\r\nsound? hear you that crashing noise, all-pervading and formidable? 'Tis\r\nthe breaking up of the ice! 'tis the melting of the Neva! 'tis the\r\nriver resuming its course! 'tis the water, living, joyous, and\r\nterrible, heaving up the hideous, dead ice, and crushing it.--'Twas\r\ngranite, said you; see, it splinters like glass! 'tis the breaking up\r\nof the ice, I tell you: 'tis the truth returning, 'tis progress\r\nrecommencing, 'tis mankind resuming its march, and uprooting, carrying\r\noff, mingling, crushing and drowning in its waves, like the wretched\r\nfurniture of a submerged hovel, not only the brand-new empire of Louis\r\nBonaparte, but all the structures and all the work of the eternal\r\nantique despotism! Look on these things as they are passing. They are\r\nvanishing for ever. You will never behold them again. That book, half\r\nsubmerged, is the old code of iniquity; that sinking framework is the\r\nthrone; that other framework, floating off, is the scaffold!\r\n\r\nAnd for this immense engulfment, this supreme victory of life over\r\ndeath, what was needed? One glance from thee, O sun! one of thy rays, O\r\nliberty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, born at Paris, on April 20, 1808, is\r\nthe son of Hortense de Beauharnais, who was married by the Emperor\r\nto Louis-Napoleon, King of Holland. In 1831, taking part in the\r\ninsurrections in Italy, where his elder brother was killed, Louis\r\nBonaparte attempted to overthrow the Papacy. On the 30th of October,\r\n1836, he attempted to overthrow Louis Philippe. He failed at Strasburg,\r\nand, being pardoned by the King, he embarked for America, leaving his\r\naccomplices behind him to be tried. On the 11th of November he wrote:\r\n\"The King, _in his clemency_, has ordered me taken to America;\" he\r\ndeclared himself \"keenly affected by the King's _generosity_,\" adding:\r\n\"Certainly, we were all culpable towards the government in taking up\r\narms against it, but _the greatest culprit was myself_;\" and he\r\nconcluded thus: \"I was _guilty_ towards the government, and the\r\ngovernment has been _generous_ to me.\"[1] He returned from America, and\r\nwent to Switzerland, got himself appointed captain of artillery at\r\nBerne, and a citizen of Salenstein, in Thurgovia; equally avoiding,\r\namid the diplomatic complications occasioned by his presence, to call\r\nhimself a Frenchman, or to avow himself a Swiss, and contenting\r\nhimself, in order to satisfy the French government, with stating in a\r\nletter, dated the 20th of August, 1838, that he lived \"almost alone,\"\r\nin the house \"where his mother died,\" and that it was \"his firm\r\ndetermination to remain quiet.\"\r\n\r\n      [1] A letter read at the Court of Assize by the advocate Parquin,\r\n      who, after reading it, exclaimed: \"Among the numerous faults of\r\n      Louis-Napoleon, we may not, at least, include ingratitude.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August, 1840 he disembarked at Boulogne, parodying the\r\ndisembarkation at Cannes, with the _petit chapeau_ on his head,[2]\r\ncarrying a gilt eagle on the end of a flag-staff, and a live eagle in\r\na cage, proclamations galore, and sixty valets, cooks, and grooms,\r\ndisguised as French soldiers with uniforms bought at the Temple, and\r\nbuttons of the 42nd Regiment of the Line, made in London. He scatters\r\nmoney among the passers-by in the streets of Boulogne, sticks his hat\r\non the point of his sword, and himself cries, \"Vive l'Empereur!\" fires\r\na pistol shot at an officer,[3] which hits a soldier and knocks out\r\nthree of his teeth, and finally runs away. He is taken into custody;\r\nthere are found on his person 500,000 francs, in gold and\r\nbank-notes;[4] the procureur-general, Franck-Carrè, says to him in\r\nthe Court of Peers: \"You have been tampering with the soldiers, and\r\ndistributing money to purchase treason.\" The peers sentenced him to\r\nperpetual imprisonment. He was confined at Ham. There his mind seemed\r\nto take refuge within itself and to mature: he wrote and published some\r\nbooks, instinct, notwithstanding a certain ignorance of France and of\r\nthe age, with democracy and with progress: \"The Extinction of\r\nPauperism,\" \"An Analysis of the Sugar Question,\" \"Napoleonic Ideas,\" in\r\nwhich he made the Emperor a \"humanitarian.\" In a treatise entitled\r\n\"Historical Fragments,\" he wrote thus: \"I am a citizen before I am a\r\nBonaparte.\" Already in 1852, in his book \"Political Reveries,\" he had\r\ndeclared himself a republican. After five years of captivity, he\r\nescaped from the prison of Ham, disguised as a mason, and took refuge\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n      [2] Court of Peers. Attempt of the 6th August, 1840, page 140,\r\n      evidence of Geoffroy, grenadier.\r\n\r\n      [3] Captain Col. Puygellier, who had said to him: \"You are a\r\n      conspirator and a traitor.\"\r\n\r\n      [4] Court of Peers. Evidence of the witness Adam, Mayor of\r\n      Boulogne.\r\n\r\nFebruary arrived; he hailed the Republic, took his seat as a\r\nrepresentative of the people in the Constituent Assembly, mounted the\r\ntribune on the 21st of September, 1848, and said: \"All my life shall\r\nbe devoted to strengthening the Republic;\" published a manifesto which\r\nmay be summed up in two lines: liberty, progress, democracy, amnesty,\r\nabolition of the decrees of proscription and banishment; was elected\r\nPresident by 5,500,000 votes, solemnly swore allegiance to the\r\nConstitution on the 20th of December, 1848, and on the 2nd of December,\r\n1851, shattered that Constitution. In the interval he had destroyed\r\nthe Roman republic, and had restored in 1849 that Papacy which in 1831\r\nhe had essayed to overthrow. He had, besides, taken nobody knows how\r\ngreat a share in the obscure affair of the lottery of the gold ingots.\r\nA few weeks previous to the _coup d'état_, this bag of gold became\r\ntransparent, and there was visible within it a hand greatly resembling\r\nhis. On December 2, and the following days, he, the executive power,\r\nassailed the legislative power, arrested the representatives, drove\r\nout the assembly, dissolved the Council of State, expelled the high\r\ncourt of justice, suppressed the laws, took 25,000,000 francs from\r\nthe bank, gorged the army with gold, swept the streets of Paris with\r\ngrape-shot, and terrorized France. Since then, he has proscribed\r\neighty-four representatives of the people; stolen from the Princes of\r\nOrleans the property of their father, Louis Philippe, to whom he owed\r\nhis life; decreed despotism in fifty-eight articles, under the name of\r\nConstitution; throttled the Republic; made the sword of France a gag\r\nin the mouth of liberty; pawned the railways; picked the pockets of\r\nthe people; regulated the budget by ukase; transported to Africa and\r\nCayenne ten thousand democrats; banished to Belgium, Spain, Piedmont,\r\nSwitzerland, and England forty thousand republicans, brought grief to\r\nevery heart and the blush of shame to every brow.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte thinks that he is mounting the steps of a throne; he\r\ndoes not perceive that he is mounting those of a scaffold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte is a man of middle height, cold, pale, slow in his\r\nmovements, having the air of a person not quite awake. He has\r\npublished, as we have mentioned before, a moderately esteemed treatise\r\non artillery, and is thought to be acquainted with the handling of\r\ncannon. He is a good horseman. He speaks drawlingly, with a slight\r\nGerman accent. His histrionic abilities were displayed at the Eglinton\r\ntournament. He has a heavy moustache, covering his smile, like that of\r\nthe Duke of Alva, and a lifeless eye like that of Charles IX.\r\n\r\nJudging him apart from what he calls his \"necessary acts,\" or his\r\n\"great deeds,\" he is a vulgar, commonplace personage, puerile,\r\ntheatrical, and vain. Those persons who are invited to St. Cloud, in\r\nthe summer, receive with the invitation an order to bring a morning\r\ntoilette and an evening toilette. He loves finery, display, feathers,\r\nembroidery, tinsel and spangles, big words, and grand titles,--everything\r\nthat makes a noise and glitter, all the glassware of power. In his\r\ncapacity of cousin to the battle of Austerlitz, he dresses as a\r\ngeneral. He cares little about being despised; he contents himself with\r\nthe appearance of respect.\r\n\r\nThis man would tarnish the background of history; he absolutely sullies\r\nits foreground. Europe smiled when, glancing at Haiti, she saw this\r\nwhite Soulouque appear. But there is now in Europe, in every\r\nintelligent mind, abroad as at home, a profound stupor, a feeling, as\r\nit were, of personal insult; for the European continent, whether it\r\nwill or no, is responsible for France, and whatever abases France\r\nhumiliates Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore the 2nd of December, the leaders of the Right used freely to say\r\nof Louis Bonaparte: \"_He is an idiot._\" They were mistaken. To be sure\r\nthat brain of his is awry, and has gaps in it, but one can discern here\r\nand there thoughts consecutive and concatenate. It is a book whence\r\npages have been torn. Louis Napoleon has a fixed idea; but a fixed idea\r\nis not idiocy; he knows what he wants, and he goes straight to it;\r\nthrough justice, through law, through reason, through honour, through\r\nhumanity, it may be, but straight on none the less.\r\n\r\nHe is not an idiot. He is a man of another age than our own. He seems\r\nabsurd and mad, because he is out of his place and time. Transport him\r\nto Spain in the 16th century, and Philip II would recognise him; to\r\nEngland, and Henry VIII would smile on him; to Italy, and Cæsar Borgia\r\nwould jump on his neck. Or even, confine yourself to setting him\r\noutside the pale of European civilization,--place him, in 1817, at\r\nJanina, and Ali-Tepeleni would grasp him by the hand.\r\n\r\nThere is in him something of the Middle Ages, and of the Lower Empire.\r\nThat which he does would have seemed perfectly simple and natural to\r\nMichael Ducas, to Romanus Diogenes, to Nicephorus Botoniates, to the\r\nEunuch Narses, to the Vandal Stilico, to Mahomet II, to Alexander VI,\r\nto Ezzelino of Padua, as it seems perfectly simple and natural to\r\nhimself. But he forgets, or knows not, that in the age wherein we live,\r\nhis actions will have to traverse the great streams of human morality,\r\nset free by three centuries of literature and by the French Revolution;\r\nand that in this medium, his actions will wear their true aspect, and\r\nappear what they really are--hideous.\r\n\r\nHis partisans--he has some--complacently compare him with his uncle,\r\nthe first Bonaparte. They say: \"The one accomplished the 18th Brumaire,\r\nthe other the 2nd of December: they are two ambitious men.\" The first\r\nBonaparte aimed to reconstruct the Empire of the West, to make Europe\r\nhis vassal, to dominate the continent by his power, and to dazzle it by\r\nhis grandeur; to take an arm-chair himself, and give footstools to the\r\nkings; to cause history to say: \"Nimrod, Cyrus, Alexander, Hannibal,\r\nCæsar, Charlemagne, Napoleon;\" to be a master of the world. And so he\r\nwas. It was for that that he accomplished the 18th Brumaire. This\r\nfellow would fain have horses and women, be called _Monseigneur_, and\r\nlive luxuriously. It was for this that he accomplished the 2nd of\r\nDecember. Yes: they are both ambitious; the comparison is just.\r\n\r\nLet us add, that, like the first Bonaparte, the second also aims to be\r\nemperor. But that which somewhat impairs the force of the comparison\r\nis, that there is perhaps, a slight difference between conquering an\r\nempire and pilfering it.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, that which is certain and which cannot be veiled,\r\neven by the dazzling curtain of glory and of misfortune on which are\r\ninscribed: Arcola, Lodi, the Pyramids, Eylau, Friedland, St.\r\nHelena--that which is certain, we repeat, is that the 18th Brumaire was\r\na crime, of which the 2nd of December has aggravated the stain on the\r\nmemory of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nM. Louis Bonaparte does not object to have it whispered that he is a\r\nsocialist. He feels that this gives him a sort of vague field which\r\nambition may exploit. As we have already said, when he was in prison,\r\nhe passed his time in acquiring a quasi-reputation as a democrat. One\r\nfact will describe him. When, being at Ham, he published his book \"On\r\nthe Extinction of Pauperism,\" a book having apparently for its sole and\r\nexclusive aim, to probe the wound of the poverty of the common people,\r\nand to suggest the remedy, he sent the book to one of his friends with\r\nthis note, which we have ourselves seen: \"Read this book on pauperism,\r\nand tell me if you think it is calculated _to do me good_.\"\r\n\r\nThe great talent of M. Louis Bonaparte is silence. Before the 2nd of\r\nDecember, he had a council of ministers who, being responsible,\r\nimagined that they were of some consequence. The President presided.\r\nNever, or scarcely ever, did he take part in their discussions. While\r\nMM. Odillon Barrot, Passy, Tocqueville, Dufaure, or Faucher were\r\nspeaking, _he occupied himself_, says one of these ministers, _in\r\nconstructing, with intense earnestness, paper dolls, or in drawing\r\nmen's heads on the documents before him_.\r\n\r\nTo feign death, that is his art. He remains mute and motionless,\r\nlooking in the opposite direction from his object, until the hour for\r\naction comes; then he turns his head, and leaps upon his prey. His\r\npolicy appears to you abruptly, at some unexpected turning, pistol in\r\nhand, like a thief. Up to that point, there is the least possible\r\nmovement. For one moment, in the course of the three years that have\r\njust passed, he was seen face to face with Changarnier, who also, on\r\nhis part, had a scheme in view. \"Ibant obscuri,\" as Virgil says. France\r\nobserved, with a certain anxiety, these two men. What was in their\r\nminds? Did not the one dream of Cromwell, the other of Monk? Men asked\r\none another these questions as they looked on the two men. In both of\r\nthem, there was the same attitude of mystery, the same policy of\r\nimmobility. Bonaparte said not a word, Changarnier made not a gesture;\r\nthis one did not stir, that one did not breathe; they seemed to be\r\nplaying the game of which should be the most statuesque.\r\n\r\nThis silence of his, Louis Bonaparte sometimes breaks; but then he does\r\nnot speak, he lies. This man lies as other men breathe. He announces an\r\nhonest intention; be on your guard: he makes an assertion, distrust\r\nhim: he takes an oath, tremble.\r\n\r\nMachiavel made small men; Louis Bonaparte is one of them.\r\n\r\nTo announce an enormity against which the world protests, to disavow it\r\nwith indignation, to swear by all the gods, to declare himself an\r\nhonest man,--and then, at the moment when people are reassured, and\r\nlaugh at the enormity in question, to execute it. This was his course\r\nwith respect to the _coup d'état_, with respect to the decrees of\r\nproscription, with respect to the spoliation of the Princes of\r\nOrleans;--and so it will be with the invasion of Belgium, and of\r\nSwitzerland, and with everything else. It is his way; you may think\r\nwhat you please of it; he employs it; he finds it effective; it is\r\nhis affair. He will have to settle the matter with history.\r\n\r\nYou are of his familiar circle; he hints at a project, which seems to\r\nyou, not immoral,--one does not scrutinize so closely,--but insane and\r\ndangerous, and dangerous to himself; you raise objections; he listens,\r\nmakes no reply, sometimes gives way for a day or two, then resumes his\r\nproject, and carries out his will.\r\n\r\nThere is in his table, in his office at the Élysée, a drawer,\r\nfrequently half open. He takes thence a paper; reads it to a minister;\r\nit is a decree. The minister assents or dissents. If he dissents, Louis\r\nBonaparte throws the paper back into the drawer, where there are many\r\nother papers, the dreams of an omnipotent man, shuts the drawer, takes\r\nout the key, and leaves the room without saying a word. The minister\r\nbows and retires, delighted with the deference which has been paid to\r\nhis opinion. Next morning the decree is in the _Moniteur_.\r\n\r\nSometimes with the minister's signature.\r\n\r\nThanks to this _modus operandi_, he has always in his service the\r\nunforeseen, a mighty weapon, and encountering in himself no internal\r\nobstacle in that which is known to other men as conscience, he pursues\r\nhis design, through no matter what, no matter how, and attains his\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nHe draws back sometimes, not before the moral effect of his acts, but\r\nbefore their material effect. The decrees of expulsion of eighty-four\r\nrepresentatives of the people, published on January 6 in the\r\n_Moniteur_, revolted public sentiment. Fast bound as France was,\r\nthe shudder was perceptible. The 2nd of December was not long past;\r\nthere was danger in popular excitement. Louis Bonaparte understood\r\nthis. Next day a second decree of expulsion was to have appeared,\r\ncontaining eight hundred names. Louis Bonaparte had the proof brought\r\nto him from the _Moniteur_; the list occupied fourteen columns of\r\nthe official journal. He crumpled the proof, threw it into the fire,\r\nand the decree did not appear. The proscriptions proceeded without a\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\nIn his enterprises, he needs aids and collaborators; he needs what he\r\ncalls \"men.\" Diogenes sought them with a lantern, he seeks them with a\r\nbanknote in his hand. And finds them. There are certain sides of human\r\nnature which produce a particular species of persons, of whom he is the\r\ncentre, and who group around him _ex necessitate_, in obedience to\r\nthat mysterious law of gravitation which regulates the moral being no\r\nless than the cosmic atom. To undertake \"the act of the 2nd of\r\nDecember,\"--to execute it, and to complete it, he needed these men, and\r\nhe had them. Now he is surrounded by them; these men form his retinue,\r\nhis court, mingling their radiance with his. At certain epochs of\r\nhistory, there are pleiades of great men; at other epochs, there are\r\npleiades of vagabonds.\r\n\r\nBut do not confound the epoch, the moment of Louis Bonaparte, with the\r\n19th century: the toadstool sprouts at the foot of the oak, but it is\r\nnot the oak.\r\n\r\nM. Louis Bonaparte has succeeded. He has with him henceforth money,\r\nspeculation, the Bourse, the Bank, the counting-room, the strong-box,\r\nand all those men who pass so readily from one side to the other, when\r\nall they have to straddle is shame. He made of M. Changarnier a dupe,\r\nof M. Thiers a stop-gap, of M. de Montalembert an accomplice, of power\r\na cavern, of the budget his farm. They are coining at the Mint a medal,\r\ncalled the medal of the 2nd of December, in honour of the manner in\r\nwhich he keeps his oaths. The frigate _La Constitution_ has been\r\ndebaptized, and is now called _L'Élysée_. He can, when he chooses,\r\nbe crowned by M. Sibour,[1] and exchange the couch of the Élysée for\r\nthe state bed of the Tuileries. Meanwhile, for the last seven months,\r\nhe has been displaying himself; he has harangued, triumphed, presided\r\nat banquets, given balls, danced, reigned, turned himself about in all\r\ndirections; he has paraded himself, in all his ugliness, in a box at\r\nthe Opéra; he has had himself dubbed Prince-President; he has\r\ndistributed standards to the army, and crosses of honour to the\r\ncommissioners of police. When there was occasion to select a symbol, he\r\neffaced himself and chose the eagle; modesty of a sparrow-hawk!\r\n\r\n      [1] The Archbishop of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIN CONTINUATION OF THE PANEGYRICS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has succeeded. The result is that he has plenty of apotheoses. Of\r\npanegyrists he has more than Trajan. One thing, however, has struck me,\r\nwhich is, that among all the qualities that have been discovered in him\r\nsince the 2nd of December, among all the eulogies that have been\r\naddressed to him, there is not one word outside of this circle:\r\nadroitness, coolness, daring, address, an affair admirably prepared and\r\nconducted, moment well chosen, secret well kept, measures well taken.\r\nFalse keys well made--that's the whole story. When these things have\r\nbeen said, all has been said, except a phrase or two about \"clemency;\"\r\nand yet no one extols the magnanimity of Mandrin, who, sometimes, did\r\nnot take all the traveller's money, and of Jean l'Ecorcheur, who,\r\nsometimes, did not kill all travellers.\r\n\r\nIn endowing M. Bonaparte with twelve millions of francs, and four\r\nmillions more for keeping up the châteaux, the Senate--endowed by M.\r\nBonaparte with a million--felicitated M. Bonaparte upon \"having saved\r\nsociety,\" much as a character in a comedy congratulates another on\r\nhaving \"saved the money-box.\"\r\n\r\nFor myself, I am still seeking in the glorification of M. Bonaparte by\r\nhis most ardent apologists, any praise that would not exactly befit\r\nCartouche or Poulailler, after a good stroke of business; and I blush\r\nsometimes for the French language, and for the name of Napoleon, at the\r\nterms, really over-raw, and too thinly veiled, and too appropriate to\r\nthe facts, in which the magistracy and clergy felicitate this man on\r\nhaving stolen the power of the State by burglarising the Constitution,\r\nand on having, by night, evaded his oath.\r\n\r\nWhen all the burglaries and all the robberies which constitute the\r\nsuccess of his policy had been accomplished, he resumed his true name;\r\nevery one then saw that this man was a Monseigneur. It was M.\r\nFortoul,[1]--to his honour be it said--who first made this discovery.\r\n\r\n      [1] The first report addressed to M. Bonaparte, and in which\r\n      M. Bonaparte is called _Monseigneur_ is signed FORTOUL.\r\n\r\nWhen one measures the man and finds him so small, and then measures his\r\nsuccess, and finds it so enormous, it is impossible that the mind\r\nshould not experience some surprise. One asks oneself: \"How did he do\r\nit?\" One dissects the adventure and the adventurer, and laying aside\r\nthe advantage he derives from his name, and certain external facts, of\r\nwhich he made use in his escalade, one finds, as the basis of the man\r\nand his exploit, but two things,--cunning and cash.\r\n\r\nAs to cunning: we have already characterised this important quality of\r\nLouis Bonaparte; but it is desirable to dwell on the point.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 1848, he said to his fellow-citizens in his manifesto:\r\n\"I feel it incumbent on me to make known to you my sentiments and my\r\nprinciples. _There must be no equivocation between you and me. I am\r\nnot ambitious...._ Brought up in _free_ countries, in the school of\r\nmisfortune, _I shall ever remain faithful_ to the duties that shall be\r\nimposed on me by your suffrages, and the will of the Assembly. _I shall\r\nmake it a point of honour to leave, at the end of the four years, to my\r\nsuccessor, power consolidated, liberty intact, and real progress\r\naccomplished._\"\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 1849, in his first message to the Assembly, he wrote:\r\n\"It is my aspiration to be worthy of the confidence of the nation, by\r\nmaintaining the Constitution _which I have sworn to execute_.\" On\r\nNovember 12, 1850, in his second annual message to the Assembly, he\r\nsaid: \"If the Constitution contains defects and dangers, you are free\r\nto make them known to the country; I alone, _bound by my oath_, confine\r\nmyself within the strict limits which that Constitution has traced.\"\r\nOn September 4, in the same year, at Caen, he said: \"When, in all\r\ndirections, prosperity seems reviving, he were, indeed, _a guilty man_\r\nwho should seek to check its progress by _changing that which now\r\nexists_.\" Some time before, on July 25, 1849, at the inauguration of\r\nthe St. Quentin railway, he went to Ham, smote his breast at the\r\nrecollection of Boulogne, and uttered these solemn words:\r\n\r\n\"Now that, elected by universal France, I am become the legitimate head\r\nof this great nation, I cannot pride myself on a captivity which was\r\noccasioned by _an attack upon a regular government_.\r\n\r\n\"When one has observed the enormous evils which even the most righteous\r\nrevolutions bring in their train, one can scarcely comprehend one's\r\n_audacity in having chosen to take upon one's self the terrible\r\nresponsibility of a change_; I do not, therefore, complain of having\r\n_expiated_ here, by an imprisonment of six years, my _rash defiance of\r\nthe laws of my country_, and it is with joy that, in the very scene of\r\nmy sufferings, I propose to you a toast in honour of those who,\r\nnotwithstanding their convictions, are resolute to _respect the\r\ninstitutions of their country_.\"\r\n\r\nAll the while he was saying this, he retained in the depths of his\r\nheart, as he has since proved, after his fashion, that thought which he\r\nhad written in that same prison of Ham: \"Great enterprises seldom\r\nsucceed at the first attempt.\"[2]\r\n\r\n      [2] _Historical Fragments._\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of November, 1851, Representative F----, a\r\nfrequenter of the Élysée, was dining with M. Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n\"What do they say in Paris, and in the Assembly?\" asked the President\r\nof the representative.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, prince!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are still talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"About the _coup d'état_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Assembly believes in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--oh, not at all.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte earnestly grasped M. F----'s hands, and said to him\r\nwith feeling:\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, M. F----, you, at least, do not think me a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nThis happened a fortnight before December 2. At that time, and indeed,\r\nat that very moment, according to the admission of Maupas the\r\nconfederate, Mazas was being made ready.\r\n\r\nCash: that is M. Bonaparte's other source of strength.\r\n\r\nLet us take the facts, judicially proved by the trials at Strasburg and\r\nBoulogne.\r\n\r\nAt Strasburg, on October 30, 1836, Colonel Vaudrey, an accomplice of M.\r\nBonaparte, commissioned the quartermasters of the 4th Regiment of\r\nartillery, \"to distribute among the cannoneers of each battery, two\r\npieces of gold.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of August, 1840, in the steamboat he had freighted, the\r\n_Ville d'Edimbourg_, while at sea, M. Bonaparte called about him\r\nthe sixty poor devils, his domestics, whom he had deceived into\r\naccompanying him by telling them he was going to Hamburg on a pleasure\r\nexcursion, harangued them from the roof of one of his carriages\r\nfastened on the deck, declared his project, tossed them their disguise\r\nas soldiers, gave each of them a hundred francs, and then set them\r\ndrinking. A little drunkenness does not damage great enterprises. \"I\r\nsaw,\" said the witness Hobbs, the under-steward, before the Court of\r\nPeers,[3] \"I saw in the cabin a great quantity of money. The passengers\r\nappeared to me to be reading printed papers; they passed all the night\r\ndrinking and eating. I did nothing else but uncork bottles, and serve\r\nfood.\" Next came the captain. The magistrate asked Captain Crow: \"Did\r\nyou see the passengers drink?\"--Crow: \"To excess; I never saw anything\r\nlike it.\"[4]\r\n\r\n      [3] Court of Peers, _Depositions of witnesses_, p. 94.\r\n\r\n      [4] Court of Peers, _Depositions of witnesses_, pp. 71, 81,\r\n      88, 94.\r\n\r\nThey landed, and were met by the custom-house officers of Vimereux. M.\r\nLouis Bonaparte began proceedings, by offering the lieutenant of the\r\nguard a pension of 1,200 francs. The magistrate: \"Did you not offer the\r\ncommandant of the station a sum of money if he would march with\r\nyou?\"--The Prince: \"I caused it to be offered him, but he refused\r\nit.\"[5]\r\n\r\n      [5] Court of Peers, _Cross examination of the accused_, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Boulogne. His aides-de-camp--he had some already--wore,\r\nhanging from their necks, tin cases full of gold pieces. Others came\r\nnext with bags of small coins in their hands.[6] Then they threw money\r\nto the fishermen and the peasants, inviting them to cry: \"Long live the\r\nEmperor!\"--\"Three hundred loud-mouthed knaves will do the thing,\" had\r\nwritten one of the conspirators.[7] Louis Bonaparte approached the\r\n42nd, quartered at Boulogne.\r\n\r\n      [6] Court of Peers, _Depositions of witnesses_, pp. 103, 185,\r\n      etc.\r\n\r\n      [7] The President: Prisoner Querelles, these children that cried\r\n      out, are not they the three hundred loud-mouthed knaves that you\r\n      asked for in your letter?--(Trial at Strasburg.)\r\n\r\nHe said to the voltigeur Georges Koehly: \"_I am Napoleon_; you shall\r\nhave promotion, decorations.\" He said to the voltigeur Antoine Gendre:\r\n\"_I am the son of Napoleon_; we are going to the Hôtel du Nord to order\r\na dinner for you and me.\" He said to the voltigeur Jean Meyer: \"_You\r\nshall be well paid._\" He said to the voltigeur Joseph Mény: \"_You must\r\ncome to Paris; you shall be well paid._\"[8]\r\n\r\n      [8] Court of Peers, _Depositions of witnesses_, pp. 142, 143,\r\n      155, 156, 158.\r\n\r\nAn officer at his side held in his hand his hat full of five-franc\r\npieces, which he distributed among the lookers-on, saying: \"_Shout,\r\nLong live the Emperor!_\"\r\n\r\nThe grenadier Geoffroy, in his evidence, characterises in these words\r\nthe attempt made on his mess by an officer and a sergeant who were in\r\nthe plot: \"The sergeant had a bottle in his hand, and the officer a\r\nsabre.\" In these few words is the whole 2nd of December.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed:--\r\n\r\n\"Next day, June 17, the commandant, Mésonan, who I thought had gone,\r\nentered my room, announced by my aide-de-camp. I said to him,\r\n'Commandant, I thought you were gone!'--'No, general, I am not gone. I\r\nhave a letter to give you.'--'A letter? And from whom?'--'Read it,\r\ngeneral.'\r\n\r\n\"I asked him to take a seat; I took the letter, but as I was opening\r\nit, I saw that the address was--_à M. le Commandant Mésonan_. I said to\r\nhim: 'But, my dear Commandant, this is for you, not for me.'--'Read it,\r\nGeneral!'--I opened the letter and read thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"'My dear Commandant, it is most essential that you should\r\n    immediately see the general in question; you know he is a man of\r\n    resolution, on whom one may rely. You know also that he is a man\r\n    whom I have put down to be one day a marshal of France. _You will\r\n    offer him, from me, 100,000 francs_; and you will ask him into what\r\n    banker's or notary's hands _I shall pay 300,000 francs_ for him, in\r\n    the event of his losing his command.'\r\n\r\n\"I stopped here, overcome with indignation; I turned over the leaf, and\r\nI saw that the letter was signed, 'LOUIS NAPOLEON.'\r\n\r\n\"I handed the letter back to the commandant, saying that it was a\r\nridiculous and abortive affair.\"\r\n\r\nWho speaks thus? General Magnan. Where? In the open Court of Peers.\r\nBefore whom? Who is the man seated on the prisoners' bench, the man\r\nwhom Magnan covers with \"scorn,\" the man towards whom Magnan turns his\r\n\"indignant\" face? Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nMoney, and with money gross debauchery: such were his means of action\r\nin his three enterprises at Strasburg, at Boulogne, at Paris. Two\r\nfailures and a success. Magnan, who refused at Boulogne, sold himself\r\nat Paris. If Louis Bonaparte had been defeated on the 2nd of December,\r\njust as there were found on him, at Boulogne, the 500,000 francs he had\r\nbrought from London, so there would have been found at the Élysée, the\r\ntwenty-five millions taken from the Bank.\r\n\r\nThere has, then, been in France,--one must needs speak of these things\r\ncoolly,--in France, that land of the sword, that land of cavaliers, the\r\nland of Hoche, of Drouot, and of Bayard--there has been a day, when a\r\nman, surrounded by five or six political sharpers, experts in\r\nambuscades, and grooms of _coups d'état_, lolling in a gilded office,\r\nhis feet on the fire-dogs, a cigar in his mouth, placed a price upon\r\nmilitary honour, weighed it in the scales like a commodity, a thing\r\nbuyable and sellable, put down the general at a million, the private at\r\na louis, and said of the conscience of the French army: \"That is worth\r\nso much.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this man is the nephew of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, this nephew is not proud: he accommodates himself, with\r\ngreat facility, to the necessities of his adventures; adapts himself\r\nreadily and without reluctance, to every freak of destiny. Place him in\r\nLondon, and let it be his interest to please the English government, he\r\nwould not hesitate, and with the very hand which now seeks to seize the\r\nsceptre of Charlemagne, he would grasp the truncheon of a policeman. If\r\nI were not Napoleon, I would be Vidocq.\r\n\r\nAnd here thought pauses!\r\n\r\nAnd such is the man by whom France is governed! governed, do I say?\r\npossessed rather in full sovereignty!\r\n\r\nAnd every day, and every moment, by his decrees, by his messages, by\r\nhis harangues, by all these unprecedented imbecilities which he parades\r\nin the _Moniteur_, this _émigré_, so ignorant of France, gives lessons\r\nto France! and this knave tells France that he has saved her! From\r\nwhom? from herself. Before he came, Providence did nothing but\r\nabsurdities; God waited for him to put everything in order; and at\r\nlength he came. For the last thirty-six years poor France had been\r\nafflicted with all sorts of pernicious things: that \"sonority,\" the\r\ntribune; that hubbub, the press; that insolence, thought; that crying\r\nabuse, liberty: he came, and for the tribune, he substituted the\r\nSenate; for the press, the censorship; for thought, imbecility; for\r\nliberty, the sabre; and by the sabre, the censorship, imbecility, and\r\nthe Senate, France is saved! Saved! bravo! and from whom, I ask again?\r\nfrom herself. For what was France before, if you please? a horde of\r\npillagers, robbers, Jacquerie, assassins, demagogues! It was necessary\r\nto put fetters on this abominable villain, this France, and it was M.\r\nBonaparte Louis who applied the fetters. Now France is in prison, on\r\nbread and water, punished, humiliated, throttled and well guarded; be\r\ntranquil, everybody; Sieur Bonaparte, gendarme at the Élysée, answers\r\nfor her to Europe; this miserable France is in her strait waistcoat,\r\nand if she stirs!--\r\n\r\nAh! what spectacle is this? What dream is this? What nightmare is this?\r\nOn the one hand, a nation, first among nations, and on the other, a\r\nman, last among men--and see what that man does to that nation! God\r\nsave the mark! He tramples her under foot, he laughs at her to her\r\nface, he flouts her, he denies her, he insults her, he scoffs at her!\r\nHow now! He says, there is none but I! What! in this land of France\r\nwhere no man's ears may be boxed with impunity, one may box the ears of\r\nthe whole people! Oh! abominable shame! Each time that M. Bonaparte\r\nspits, every one must needs wipe his face! And this can last! And you\r\ntell me that it will last! No! No! No! By all the blood we have in our\r\nveins, no! this shall not last. Were it to last, it must be that there\r\nis no God in heaven, or no longer a France on earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA roll of the drums; clowns, attention!\r\n\r\n                   THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC,\r\n\r\n    \"Considering that--all the restrictive laws on the liberty of the\r\n    press having been repealed, all the laws against hand-bills and\r\n    posting-bills having been abolished, the right of public assemblage\r\n    having been fully re-established, all the unconstitutional laws,\r\n    including martial law, having been suppressed, every citizen being\r\n    empowered to say what he likes through every medium of publicity,\r\n    whether newspaper, placard, or electoral meeting, all solemn\r\n    engagements, especially the oath of the 20th of December, 1848,\r\n    having been scrupulously kept, all facts having been investigated,\r\n    all questions propounded and discussed, all candidacies publicly\r\n    defeated, without the possibility of alleging that the slightest\r\n    violence had been exercised against the meanest citizen,--in one\r\n    word, in the fullest enjoyment of liberty. \"The sovereign people\r\n    being interrogated on this question:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Do the French people mean to place themselves, tied neck and\r\n    heels, at the discretion of M.

This year they are eighty; they will be one\r\nhundred and fifty next year. They monopolise to themselves, in full\r\nplenitude, fourteen articles of the Constitution, from Article 19 to\r\nArticle 33. They are \"guardians of the public liberties;\" their\r\nfunctions are gratuitous by Article 22; consequently, they have from\r\nfifteen to thirty thousand francs per annum. They have the peculiar\r\nprivilege of receiving their salary, and the prerogative of \"not\r\nopposing\" the promulgation of the laws. They are all illustrious\r\npersonages.\"[2] This is not an \"abortive Senate,\"[3] like that of\r\nNapoleon the uncle; this is a genuine Senate; the marshals are members,\r\nand the cardinals and M. Leboeuf.\r\n\r\n      [2] \"All the illustrious persons of the country.\" Louis\r\n      Bonaparte's _Appeal to the people_. December 2, 1851.\r\n\r\n      [3] \"The Senate was an abortion; and in France no one likes to\r\n      see people well paid merely for making some bad selections.\"\r\n      Words of Napoleon, _Memorial from St. Helena_.\r\n\r\n\"What is your position in the country?\" some one asks the Senate. \"We\r\nare charged with the preservation of public liberty.\"--\"What is your\r\nbusiness in this city?\" Pierrot demands of Harlequin.--\"My business,\"\r\nreplies Harlequin, \"is to curry-comb the bronze horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know what is meant by _esprit-de-corps_: this spirit will urge the\r\nSenate by every possible means to augment its power. It will destroy\r\nthe Corps Législatif, if it can; and if occasion offers it will\r\ncompound with the Bourbons.\"\r\n\r\nWho said this? The First Consul. Where? At the Tuileries, in April,\r\n1804.\r\n\r\n\"Without title or authority, and in violation of every principle, it\r\nhas surrendered the country and consummated its ruin. It has been the\r\nplaything of eminent intriguers; I know of no body which ought to\r\nappear in history with greater ignominy than the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nWho said this? The Emperor. Where? At St. Helena.\r\n\r\nThere is actually then a senate in the \"Constitution of January 14.\"\r\nBut, candidly speaking, this is a mistake; for now that public hygiene\r\nhas made some progress, we are accustomed to see the public highway\r\nbetter kept. After the Senate of the Empire, we thought that no more\r\nsenates would be mixed up with Constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF STATE AND THE CORPS LÉGISLATIF\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a Council of State and a Corps Législatif: the former\r\njoyous, well paid, plump, rosy, fat, and fresh, with a sharp eye, a red\r\near, a voluble tongue, a sword by its side, a belly, and embroidered in\r\ngold; the Corps Législatif, pale, meagre, sad, and embroidered in\r\nsilver. The Council of State comes and goes, enters and exits, returns,\r\nrules, disposes, decides, settles, and decrees, and sees Louis Napoleon\r\nface to face. The Corps Législatif, on the contrary, walks on tiptoe,\r\nfumbles with its hat, puts its finger to its lips, smiles humbly, sits\r\non the corner of its chair, and speaks only when questioned. Its words\r\nbeing naturally obscene, the public journals are forbidden to make the\r\nslightest allusion to them. The Corps Législatif passes laws and votes\r\ntaxes by Article 39; and when, fancying it has occasion for some\r\ninstruction, some detail, some figures, or some explanation, it\r\npresents itself, hat in hand, at the door of the departments to consult\r\nthe ministers, the usher receives it in the antechamber, and with a\r\nroar of laughter, gives it a fillip on the nose. Such are the duties of\r\nthe Corps Législatif.\r\n\r\nLet us state, however, that this melancholy position began, in June,\r\n1852, to extort some sighs from the sorrowful personages who form a\r\nportion of the concern. The report of the commission on the budget will\r\nremain in the memory of men, as one of the most heart-rending\r\nmasterpieces of the plaintive style. Let us repeat those gentle\r\naccents:--\r\n\r\n\"Formerly, as you know, the necessary communications in such cases were\r\ncarried on directly between the commissioners and the ministers. It was\r\nto the latter that they addressed themselves to obtain the documents\r\nindispensable to the discussion of affairs; and the ministers even came\r\npersonally, with the heads of their several departments, to give verbal\r\nexplanations, frequently sufficient to preclude the necessity of\r\nfurther discussion; and the resolutions formed by the commission on the\r\nbudget after they had heard them, were submitted direct to the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\"But now we can have no communication with the government except\r\nthrough the medium of the Council of State, which, being the confidant\r\nand the organ of its own ideas, has alone the right of transmitting to\r\nthe Corps Législatif the documents which, in its turn, it receives from\r\nthe ministers.\r\n\r\n\"In a word, for written reports, as well as for verbal communications,\r\nthe government commissioners have superseded the ministers, with whom,\r\nhowever, they must have a preliminary understanding.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the modifications which the commission might wish to\r\npropose, whether by the adoption of amendments presented by the\r\ndeputies, or from its own examination of the budget, they must, before\r\nyou are called upon to consider them, be sent to the Council of State,\r\nthere to undergo discussion.\r\n\r\n\"There (it is impossible not to notice it) those modifications have no\r\ninterpreters, no official defenders.\r\n\r\n\"This mode of procedure appears to be derived from the Constitution\r\nitself; and _if we speak of the matter now_, it is _solely_ to prove to\r\nyou that it must occasion _delays_ in accomplishing the task imposed\r\nupon the commission on the budget.\"[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] Report of the commission on the budget of the Corps\r\n      Législatif, June, 1852.\r\n\r\nReproach was never so mildly uttered; it is impossible to receive more\r\nchastely and more gracefully, what M. Bonaparte, in his autocratic\r\nstyle, calls \"guarantees of calmness,\"[2] but what Molière, with the\r\nlicense of a great writer, denominates \"kicks.\"[3]\r\n\r\n      [2] Preamble of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n      [3] See _Les Fourberies de Scapin_.\r\n\r\nThus, in the shop where laws and budgets are manufactured, there is a\r\nmaster of the house, the Council of State, and a servant, the Corps\r\nLégislatif. According to the terms of the \"Constitution,\" who is it\r\nthat appoints the master of the house? M. Bonaparte. Who appoints the\r\nservant? The nation. That is as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nLet it be observed that, under the shadow of these \"wise institutions,\"\r\nand thanks to the _coup d'état_, which, as is well known, has\r\nre-established order, the finances, the public safety, and public\r\nprosperity, the budget, by the admission of M. Gouin, shows a deficit\r\nof 123,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAs for commercial activity since the _coup d'état_, as for the\r\nprosperity of trade, as for the revival of business, in order to\r\nappreciate them it is enough to reject words and have recourse to\r\nfigures. On this point, the following statement is official and\r\ndecisive: the discounts of the Bank of France produced during the first\r\nhalf of 1852, only 589,502fr. 62c. at the central bank; while the\r\nprofits of the branch establishments have risen only to 651,108fr. 7c.\r\nThis appears from the half-yearly report of the Bank itself.\r\n\r\nM. Bonaparte, however, does not trouble himself with taxation. Some\r\nfine morning he wakes and yawns, rubs his eyes, takes his pen and\r\ndecrees--what? The budget. Achmet III. was once desirous of levying\r\ntaxes according to his own fancy.--\"Invincible lord,\" said his Vizier\r\nto him, \"your subjects cannot be taxed beyond what is prescribed by the\r\nlaw and the prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThis identical M. Bonaparte, when at Ham, wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"If the sums levied each year on the inhabitants generally are\r\n    employed for unproductive purposes, such as creating _useless\r\n    places, raising sterile monuments, and maintaining in the midst of\r\n    profound peace a more expensive army than that which conquered at\r\n    Austerlitz_, taxation becomes in such case an overwhelming burden;\r\n    it exhausts the country, it takes without any return.\"[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] _Extinction of Pauperism_, page 10.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this word budget an observation occurs to us. In\r\nthis present year 1852, the bishops and the judges of the _Cour de\r\nCassation_,[2] have 50 francs per diem; the archbishops, the\r\ncouncillors of state, the first presidents, and the procureurs-general,\r\nhave each 69 francs per diem; the senators, the prefects, and the\r\ngenerals of division receive 83 francs each per diem; the presidents of\r\nsections of the Council of State 222 francs per diem; the ministers 252\r\nfrancs per diem; Monseigneur the Prince-President, comprising of\r\ncourse, in his salary, the sum for maintenance of the royal residences,\r\nreceives per diem 44,444 francs, 44 centimes. The revolution of the 2nd\r\nof December was made against the Twenty-five Francs!\r\n\r\n      [2] Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen what the legislature is, what the administration, and\r\nwhat the budget.\r\n\r\nAnd the courts! What was formerly called the _Cour de Cassation_ is no\r\nlonger anything more than a record office of councils of war. A soldier\r\nsteps out of the guard-house and writes in the margin of the book of\r\nthe law, _I will_, or _I will not_. In all directions the corporal\r\ngives the order, and the magistrate countersigns it. Come! tuck up your\r\ngowns and begone, or else--Hence these abominable trials, sentences,\r\nand condemnations. What a sorry spectacle is that troop of judges, with\r\nhanging heads and bent backs, driven with the butt end of the musket\r\ninto baseness and iniquity!\r\n\r\nAnd the liberty of the press! What shall we say of it? Is it not a\r\nmockery merely to pronounce the words? That free press, the honour of\r\nFrench intellect, a light thrown from all points at once upon all\r\nquestions, the perpetual sentinel of the nation--where is it? What has\r\nM. Bonaparte done with it? It is where the public platform is. Twenty\r\nnewspapers extinguished in Paris, eighty in the departments,--one\r\nhundred newspapers suppressed: that is to say, looking only to the\r\nmaterial side of the question, innumerable families deprived of bread;\r\nthat is to say, understand it, citizens, one hundred houses\r\nconfiscated, one hundred farms taken from their proprietors, one\r\nhundred interest coupons stolen from the public funds. Marvellous\r\nidentity of principles: freedom suppressed is property destroyed. Let\r\nthe selfish idiots who applaud the _coup d'état_ reflect upon\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nInstead of a law concerning the press a decree has been laid upon it; a\r\n_fetfa_, a _firman_, dated from the imperial stirrup: the régime of\r\nadmonition. This régime is well known. Its working is witnessed daily.\r\nSuch men were requisite to invent such a thing. Despotism has never\r\nshown itself more grossly insolent and stupid than in this species of\r\ncensorship of the morrow, which precedes and announces the suppression,\r\nand which administers the bastinado to a paper before killing it\r\nentirely. The folly of such a government corrects and tempers its\r\natrocity. The whole of the decree concerning the press may be summed up\r\nin one line: \"I permit you to speak, but I require you to be silent.\"\r\nWho reigns, in God's name? Is it Tiberius? Is it Schahabaham?\r\nThree-fourths of the republican journalists transported or proscribed,\r\nthe remainder hunted down by mixed commissions, dispersed, wandering,\r\nin hiding. Here and there, in four or five of the surviving journals,\r\nin four or five which are independent but closely watched, over whose\r\nheads is suspended the club of Maupas,[1] some fifteen or twenty\r\nwriters, courageous, serious, pure, honest, and noble-hearted, who\r\nwrite, as it were, with a chain round their necks, and a ball on their\r\nfeet; talent between two sentinels, independence gagged, honesty under\r\nsurveillance, and Veuillot exclaiming: \"I am free!\"\r\n\r\n      [1] The Prefect of Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNOVELTIES IN RESPECT TO WHAT IS LAWFUL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe press enjoys the privilege of being censored, of being admonished,\r\nof being suspended, of being suppressed; it has even the privilege of\r\nbeing tried. Tried! By whom? By the courts. What courts? The police\r\ncourts. And what about that excellent trial by jury? Progress: it is\r\noutstripped. The jury is far behind us, and we return to the government\r\njudges. \"Repression is more rapid and more efficacious,\" as Maître\r\nRouher says. And then 'tis so much better. Call the causes:\r\ncorrectional police, sixth chamber; first cause, one Roumage, swindler;\r\nsecond cause, one Lamennais, writer. This has a good effect, and\r\naccustoms the citizens to talk without distinction of writers and\r\nswindlers. That, certainly, is an advantage; but in a practical point\r\nof view, with reference to \"repression,\" is the government quite sure\r\nof what it has done on that head? Is it quite sure that the sixth\r\nchamber will answer better than the excellent assize court of Paris,\r\nfor instance, which had for president such abject creatures as\r\nPartarrieu-Lafosse, and for advocates at its bar, such base wretches as\r\nSuin, and such dull orators as Mongis? Can it reasonably expect that\r\nthe police judges will be still more base and more contemptible than\r\nthey? Will those judges, salaried as they are, work better than that\r\njury-squad, who had the department prosecutor for corporal, and who\r\npronounced their judgments and gesticulated their verdicts with the\r\nprecision of a charge in double quick time, so that the prefect of\r\npolice, Carlier, good-humouredly observed to a celebrated advocate, M.\r\nDesm----: \"_The jury! what a stupid institution! When not forced to\r\nit they never condemn, but when forced they never acquit._\" Let us\r\nweep for that worthy jury which was made by Carlier and unmade by\r\nRouher.\r\n\r\nThis government feels that it is hideous. It wants no portrait; above\r\nall it wants no mirror. Like the osprey it takes refuge in darkness,\r\nand it would die if once seen. Now it wishes to endure. It does not\r\npropose to be talked about; it does not propose to be described. It has\r\nimposed silence on the press of France; we have seen in what manner.\r\nBut to silence the press in France was only half-success. It must also\r\nbe silenced in foreign countries. Two prosecutions were attempted in\r\nBelgium, against the _Bulletin Français_ and against _La Nation_. They\r\nwere acquitted by an honest Belgian jury. This was annoying. What was\r\nto be done? The Belgian journals were attacked through their pockets.\r\n\"You have subscribers in France,\" they were told; \"but if you 'discuss'\r\nus, you shall be kept out. If you wish to come in, make yourselves\r\nagreeable.\" An attempt was made to frighten the English journals. \"If\r\nyou 'discuss' us\"--decidedly they do not wish to be _discussed_--\"we\r\nshall drive your correspondents out of France.\" The English press\r\nroared with laughter. But this is not all. There are French writers\r\noutside of France: they are proscribed, that is to say they are free.\r\nSuppose those fellows should speak? Suppose those demagogues should\r\nwrite? They are very capable of doing both; and we must prevent them.\r\nBut how are we to do it? To gag people at a distance is not so easy a\r\nmatter: M. Bonaparte's arm is not long enough for that. Let us try,\r\nhowever; we will prosecute them in the countries where they have taken\r\nrefuge. Very good: the juries of free countries will understand that\r\nthese exiles represent justice, and that the Bonapartist government\r\npersonifies iniquity. These juries will follow the example of the\r\nBelgian jury and acquit. The friendly governments will then be\r\nsolicited to expel these refugees, to banish these exiles. Very good:\r\nthe exiles will go elsewhere; they will always find some corner of the\r\nearth open to them where they can speak. How then are they to be got\r\nat? Rouher and Baroche clubbed their wits together, and between them\r\nthey hit upon this expedient: to patch up a law dealing with crimes\r\ncommitted by Frenchmen in foreign countries, and to slip into it\r\n\"crimes of the press.\" The Council of State sanctioned this, and the\r\nCorps Législatif did not oppose it, and it is now the law of the land.\r\nIf we speak outside of France, we shall be condemned for the offence in\r\nFrance; imprisonment (in future, if caught), fines and confiscations.\r\nAgain, very good. The book I am now writing will, therefore, be tried\r\nin France, and its author duly convicted; this I expect, and I confine\r\nmyself to apprising all those quidams calling themselves magistrates,\r\nwho, in black and red gown, shall concoct the thing that, sentence to\r\nany fine whatever being well and duly pronounced against me, nothing\r\nwill equal my disdain for the judgment, but my contempt for the judges.\r\nThis is my defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE ADHERENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are they that flock round the establishment? As we have said, the\r\ngorge rises at thought of them.\r\n\r\nAh! these rulers of the day,--we who are now proscribed remember them\r\nwhen they were representatives of the people, only twelve months ago,\r\nrunning hither and thither in the lobbies of the Assembly, their heads\r\nhigh, and with a show of independence, and the air and manner of men\r\nwho belonged to themselves. What magnificence! and how proud they were!\r\nHow they placed their hands on their hearts while they shouted \"Vive\r\nla Republique!\" And if some \"Terrorist,\" some \"Montagnard,\" or some\r\n\"red republican,\" happened to allude from the tribune to the planned\r\n_coup d'état_ and the projected Empire, how they vociferated at him:\r\n\"You are a calumniator!\" How they shrugged their shoulders at the word\r\n\"Senate!\"--\"The Empire to-day\" cried one, \"would be blood and slime;\r\nyou slander us, we shall never be implicated in such a matter.\" Another\r\naffirmed that he consented to be one of the President's ministers\r\nsolely to devote himself to the defence of the Constitution and the\r\nlaws; a third glorified the tribune as the palladium of the country; a\r\nfourth recalled the oath of Louis Bonaparte, exclaiming: \"Do you doubt\r\nthat he is an honest man?\" These last--there were two of them--went\r\nthe length of voting for and signing his deposition, on the 2nd of\r\nDecember, at the mayoralty of the Tenth Arrondissement; another sent\r\na note on the 4th of December to the writer of these lines, to\r\n\"felicitate him on having dictated the proclamation of the Left, by\r\nwhich Louis Bonaparte was outlawed.\" And now, behold them, Senators,\r\nCouncillors of State, ministers, belaced, betagged, bedizened with\r\ngold! Base wretches! Before you embroider your sleeves, wash your\r\nhands!\r\n\r\nM. Q.-B. paid a visit to M. O.-B. and said to him: \"Can you conceive\r\nthe assurance of this Bonaparte? he has had the presumption to offer me\r\nthe place of Master of Requests!\"--\"You refused it?\"--\"Certainly.\"--The\r\nnext day, being offered the place of Councillor of State, salary\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs, our indignant Master of Requests becomes\r\na grateful Councillor of State. M. Q.-B. accepts.\r\n\r\nOne class of men rallied en masse: the fools! They comprise the sound\r\npart of the Corps Législatif. It was to them that the head of the State\r\naddressed this little flattery:--\"The first test of the Constitution,\r\nentirely of French origin, must have convinced you that we possess\r\nthe qualities of a strong and a free government. We are in earnest,\r\ndiscussion is free, and the vote of taxation decisive. France possesses\r\na government animated by faith and by love of the right, which is based\r\nupon the people, the source of all power; upon the army, the source of\r\nall strength; and upon religion, the source of all justice. Accept the\r\nassurance of my regard.\" These worthy dupes, we know them also; we\r\nhave seen a goodly number of them on the benches of the majority in the\r\nLegislative Assembly. Their chiefs, skilful manipulators, had succeeded\r\nin terrifying them,--a certain method of leading them wherever they\r\nthought proper. These chiefs, unable any longer to employ usefully\r\nthose old bugbears, the terms \"Jacobin\" and \"sans-culotte,\" decidedly\r\ntoo hackneyed, had furbished up the word \"demagogue.\" These ringleaders,\r\ntrained to all sorts of schemes and manoeuvres, exploited successfully\r\nthe word \"Mountain,\" and agitated to good purpose that startling and\r\nglorious souvenir. With these few letters of the alphabet formed into\r\nsyllables and suitably accented,--Demagogues, Montagnards, Partitioners,\r\nCommunists, Red Republicans,--they made wildfires dance before the eyes\r\nof the simple. They had found the method of perverting the brains of\r\ntheir colleagues, who were so ingenuous as to swallow them whole, so to\r\nspeak, with a sort of dictionary, wherein every expression made use of\r\nby the democratic writers and orators was readily translated. For\r\n_humanity_ read _ferocity_; for _universal good_ read _subversion_;\r\nfor _Republic_ read _Terrorism_; for _Socialism_ read _Pillage_; for\r\n_Fraternity_, read _Massacre_; for _the Gospel_, read _Death to the\r\nRich_. So that, when an orator of the Left exclaimed, for instance:\r\n\"_We rush for the suppression of war, and the abolition of the death\r\npenalty_,\" a crowd of poor souls on the Right distinctly understood:\r\n\"_We wish to put everything to fire and sword_;\" and in a fury shook\r\ntheir fists at the orator. After such speeches, in which there had been\r\na question only of liberty, of universal peace, of prosperity arising\r\nfrom labour, of concord, and of progress, the representatives of that\r\ncategory which we have designated at the head of this paragraph, were\r\nseen to rise, pale as death; they were not sure that they were not\r\nalready guillotined, and went to look for their hats to see whether\r\nthey still had heads.\r\n\r\nThese poor frightened creatures did not haggle over their adhesion to\r\nthe 2nd of December. The expression, \"Louis Napoleon has saved\r\nsociety,\" was invented especially for them.\r\n\r\nAnd those eternal prefects, those eternal mayors, those eternal\r\nmagistrates, those eternal sheriffs, those eternal complimenters of the\r\nrising sun, or of the lighted lamp, who, on the day after success,\r\nflock to the conqueror, to the triumpher, to the master, to his Majesty\r\nNapoleon the Great, to his Majesty Louis XVIII, to his Majesty\r\nAlexander I, to his Majesty Charles X, to his Majesty Louis Philippe,\r\nto Citizen Lamartine, to Citizen Cavaignac, to Monseigneur the\r\nPrince-President, kneeling, smiling, expansive, bearing upon salvers\r\nthe keys of their towns, and on their faces the keys of their\r\nconsciences!\r\n\r\nBut imbeciles ('tis an old story) have always made a part of all\r\ninstitutions, and are almost an institution of themselves; and as for\r\nthe prefects and magistrates, as for these adorers of every new régime,\r\ninsolent with, fortune and rapidity, they abound at all times. Let us\r\ndo justice to the régime of December; it can boast not only of such\r\npartisans as these, but it has creatures and adherents peculiar to\r\nitself; it has produced an altogether new race of notabilities.\r\n\r\nNations are never conscious of all the riches they possess in the\r\nmatter of knaves. Overturnings and subversions of this description\r\nare necessary to bring them to light. Then the nations wonder at what\r\nissues from the dust. It is splendid to contemplate. One whose shoes\r\nand clothes and reputation were of a sort to attract all the dogs\r\nof Europe in full cry, comes forth an ambassador. Another, who had\r\na glimpse of _Bicêtre_ and _La Roquette_,[1] awakes a general, and\r\nGrand Eagle of the Legion of Honour. Every adventurer assumes an\r\nofficial costume, furnishes himself with a good pillow stuffed with\r\nbank-notes, takes a sheet of white paper, and writes thereon: \"End\r\nof my adventures.\"--\"You know So-and-So?\"--\"Yes, is he at the\r\ngalleys?\"--\"No, he's a minister.\"\r\n\r\n      [1] State prisons in Paris and Languedoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMENS AGITAT MOLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the centre is the man--the man we have described; the man of Punic\r\nfaith, the fatal man, attacking the civilisation to arrive at power;\r\nseeking, elsewhere than amongst the true people, one knows not what\r\nferocious popularity; cultivating the still uncivilized qualities of\r\nthe peasant and the soldier, endeavouring to succeed by appealing to\r\ngross selfishness, to brutal passions, to newly awakened desires, to\r\nexcited appetites; something like a Prince Marat, with nearly the same\r\nobject, which in Marat was grand, and in Louis Bonaparte is little; the\r\nman who kills, who transports, who banishes, who expels, who\r\nproscribes, who despoils; this man with harassed gesture and glassy\r\neye, who walks with distracted air amid the horrible things he does,\r\nlike a sort of sinister somnambulist.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Louis Bonaparte, whether with friendly intent or\r\notherwise,--for these strange beings have strange flatterers,--\"He is a\r\ndictator, he is a despot, nothing more.\"--He is that in our opinion,\r\nand he is also something else.\r\n\r\nThe dictator was a magistrate. Livy[1] and Cicero[2] call him _praetor\r\nmaximus_; Seneca[3] calls him _magister populi_; what he decreed was\r\nlooked upon as a fiat from above. Livy[4] says: _pro numine observatum_.\r\nIn those times of incomplete civilisation, the rigidity of the ancient\r\nlaws not having foreseen all cases, his function was to provide for the\r\nsafety of the people; he was the product of this text: _salus populi\r\nsuprema lex esto_. He caused to be carried before him the twenty-four\r\naxes, the emblems of his power of life and death. He was outside the\r\nlaw, and above the law, but he could not touch the law. The\r\ndictatorship was a veil, behind which the law remained intact. The\r\nlaw was before the dictator and after him; and it resumed its power\r\nover him on the cessation of his office. He was appointed for a very\r\nshort period--six months only: _semestris dictatura_, says Livy.[5]\r\nBut as if this enormous power, even when freely conferred by the\r\npeople, ultimately weighed heavily upon him, like remorse, the dictator\r\ngenerally resigned before the end of his term. Cincinnatus gave it up\r\nat the end of eight days. The dictator was forbidden to dispose of\r\nthe public funds without the authority of the Senate, or to go out of\r\nItaly. He could not even ride on horseback without the permission of\r\nthe people. He might be a plebeian; Marcius Rutilus, and Publius Philo\r\nwere dictators. That magistracy was created for very different objects:\r\nto organize fêtes for saints' days; to drive a sacred nail into the\r\nwall of the Temple of Jupiter; on one occasion to appoint the Senate.\r\nRepublican Rome had eighty-eight dictators. This intermittent\r\ninstitution continued for one hundred and fifty-three years, from the\r\nyear of Rome 552, to the year 711. It began with Servilius Geminus,\r\nand reached Cæsar, passing over Sylla. It expired with Cæsar. The\r\ndictatorship was fitted to be repudiated by Cincinnatus, and to be\r\nespoused by Cæsar. Cæsar was five times dictator in the course of five\r\nyears, from 706 to 711. This was a dangerous magistracy, and it ended\r\nby devouring liberty.\r\n\r\n      [1] Lib. vii., cap. 31.\r\n\r\n      [2] De Republica. Lib. i, cap. 40.\r\n\r\n      [3] Ep. 108.\r\n\r\n      [4] Lib. iii., cap. 5.\r\n\r\n      [5] Lib. vi., cap. 1.\r\n\r\nIs M. Bonaparte a dictator? We see no impropriety in answering yes.\r\n_Praetor maximus_,--general-in-chief? the colours salute him. _Magister\r\npopuli_,--the master of the people? ask the cannons levelled on the\r\npublic squares. _Pro numine observatum_,--regarded as God? ask M.\r\nTroplong. He has appointed the Senate, he has instituted holidays, he\r\nhas provided for the \"safety of society,\" he has driven a sacred nail\r\ninto the wall of the Pantheon, and he has hung upon this nail his _coup\r\nd'état_. The only discrepancy is, that he makes and unmakes the law\r\naccording to his own fancy, he rides horseback without permission, and\r\nas to the six months, he takes a little more time. Cæsar took five\r\nyears, he takes double; that is but fair. Julius Cæsar five, M. Louis\r\nBonaparte ten--the proportion is well observed.\r\n\r\nFrom the dictator, let us pass to the despot. This is the other\r\nqualification almost accepted by M. Bonaparte. Let us speak for a while\r\nthe language of the Lower Empire. It befits the subject.\r\n\r\nThe _Despotes_ came after the _Basileus_. Among other attributes, he\r\nwas general of the infantry and of the cavalry--_magister utriusque\r\nexercitus_. It was the Emperor Alexis, surnamed the Angel, who created\r\nthe dignity of _despotes_. This officer was below the Emperor, and\r\nabove the Sebastocrator, or Augustus, and above the Cæsar.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this is somewhat the case with us. M. Bonaparte\r\nis _despotes_, if we admit, which is not difficult, that Magnan is\r\nCæsar, and that Maupas is Augustus.\r\n\r\nDespot and dictator, that is admitted. But all this great _éclat_, all\r\nthis triumphant power, does not prevent little incidents from happening\r\nin Paris, like the following, which honest _badauds_, witnesses of the\r\nfact, will tell you, musingly. Two men were walking in the street,\r\ntalking of their business or their private affairs. One of them,\r\nreferring to some knave or other, of whom he thought he had reason to\r\ncomplain, exclaimed: \"He is a wretch, a swindler, a rascal!\" A police\r\nagent who heard these last words, cried out: \"Monsieur, you are\r\nspeaking of the President; I arrest you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, will M. Bonaparte be Emperor, or will he not?\r\n\r\nA pretty question! He is master,--he is Cadi, Mufti, Bey, Dey, Sultan,\r\nGrand Khan, Grand Lama, Great Mogul, Great Dragon, Cousin to the Sun,\r\nCommander of the Faithful, Shah, Czar, Sofi, and Caliph. Paris is no\r\nlonger Paris, but Bagdad; with a Giaffar who is called Persigny, and a\r\nScheherazade who is in danger of having her head chopped off every\r\nmorning, and who is called _Le Constitutionnel_. M. Bonaparte may\r\ndo whatever he likes with property, families, and persons. If French\r\ncitizens wish to fathom the depth of the \"government\" into which they\r\nhave fallen, they have only to ask themselves a few questions. Let us\r\nsee: magistrate, he tears off your gown, and sends you to prison. What\r\nof it? Let us see: Senate, Council of State, Corps Législatif, he\r\nseizes a shovel, and flings you all in a heap in a corner. What of it?\r\nLanded proprietor, he confiscates your country house and your town\r\nhouse, with courtyards, stables, gardens, and appurtenances. What of\r\nit? Father, he takes your daughter; brother, he takes your sister;\r\ncitizen, he takes your wife, by right of might. What of it? Wayfarer,\r\nyour looks displease him, and he blows your brains out with a pistol,\r\nand goes home. What of it?\r\n\r\nAll these things being done, what would be the result? Nothing.\r\n\"Monseigneur the Prince-President took his customary drive yesterday in\r\nthe Champs Élysées, in a calèche _à la Daumont_, drawn by four horses,\r\naccompanied by a single aide-de-camp.\" This is what the newspapers will\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nHe has effaced from the walls Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity; and he\r\nis right. Frenchmen, alas! you are no longer either free,--the\r\nstrait-waistcoat is upon you; or equal,--the soldier is everything; or\r\nbrothers,--for civil war is brewing under this melancholy peace of a\r\nstate of siege.\r\n\r\nEmperor? Why not? He has a Maury who is called Sibour; he has a\r\nFontanes, or, if you prefer it, a _Faciuntasinos_, who is called\r\nFortoul; he has a Laplace who answers to the name of Leverrier,\r\nalthough he did not produce the \"_Mécanique Céleste_.\" He will easily\r\nfind Esménards and Luce de Lancivals. His Pius VII is at Rome, in the\r\ncassock of Pius IX. His green uniform has been seen at Strasburg; his\r\neagle has been seen at Boulogne; his grey riding-coat, did he not wear\r\nit at Ham? Cassock or riding-coat, 'tis all one. Madame de Staël comes\r\nout, of his house. She wrote \"Lelia.\" He smiles on her pending the day\r\nwhen he will exile her. Do you insist on an archduchess? wait awhile\r\nand he will get one. _Tu, felix Austria, nube._ His Murat is called\r\nSaint-Arnaud; his Talleyrand is called Morny; his Duc d'Enghien is\r\ncalled Law.\r\n\r\nWhat does he lack then? Nothing; a mere trifle; merely Austerlitz and\r\nMarengo.\r\n\r\nMake the best of it; he is Emperor _in petto_; one of these mornings\r\nhe will be so in the sun; nothing more is wanting than a trivial\r\nformality, the mere consecration and crowning of his false oath at\r\nNotre-Dame. After that we shall have fine doings. Expect an imperial\r\nspectacle. Expect caprices, surprises, stupefying, bewildering things,\r\nthe most unexpected combinations of words, the most fearless cacophony?\r\nExpect Prince Troplong, Duc Maupas, Duc Mimerel, Marquis Leboeuf, Baron\r\nBaroche. Form in line, courtiers; hats off, senators; the stable-door\r\nopens, monseigneur the horse is consul. Gild the oats of his highness\r\nIncitatus.\r\n\r\nEverything will be swallowed; the public hiatus will be prodigious. All\r\nthe enormities will pass away. The old fly-catchers will disappear and\r\nmake room for the swallowers of whales.\r\n\r\nTo our minds the Empire exists from this moment, and without waiting\r\nfor the interlude of the senatus consultum and the comedy of the\r\nplebiscite, we despatch this bulletin to Europe:--\r\n\r\n\"The treason of the 2nd of December is delivered of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\"The mother and child are indisposed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nOMNIPOTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us forget this man's origin and his 2nd of December, and look to\r\nhis political capacity. Shall we judge him by the eight months he has\r\nreigned? On the one hand look at his power, and on the other at his\r\nacts. What can he do? Everything. What has he done? Nothing. With his\r\nunlimited power a man of genius, in eight months, would have changed\r\nthe whole face of France, of Europe, perhaps. He would not, certainly,\r\nhave effaced the crime of his starting-point, but he might have covered\r\nit. By dint of material improvements he might have succeeded, perhaps,\r\nin masking from the nation his moral abasement. Indeed, we must admit\r\nthat for a dictator of genius the thing was not difficult. A certain\r\nnumber of social problems, elaborated during these last few years by\r\nseveral powerful minds, seemed to be ripe, and might receive immediate,\r\npractical solution, to the great profit and satisfaction of the nation.\r\nOf this, Louis Bonaparte does not appear to have had any idea. He has\r\nnot approached, he has not had a glimpse of one of them. He has not\r\neven found at the Élysée any old remains of the socialist meditations\r\nof Ham. He has added several new crimes to his first one, and in this\r\nhe has been logical. With the exception of these crimes he has produced\r\nnothing. Absolute power, no initiative! He has taken France and does\r\nnot know what to do with it. In truth, we are tempted to pity this\r\neunuch struggling with omnipotence.\r\n\r\nIt is true, however, that this dictator keeps in motion; let us do him\r\nthis justice; he does not remain quiet for an instant; he sees with\r\naffright the gloom and solitude around him; people sing who are afraid\r\nin the dark, but he keeps moving. He makes a fuss, he goes at\r\neverything, he runs after projects; being unable to create, he decrees;\r\nhe endeavours to mask his nullity; he is perpetual motion; but, alas!\r\nthe wheel turns in empty space. Conversion of _rentes_? Of what profit\r\nhas it been to this day? Saving of eighteen millions! Very good: the\r\nannuitants lose them, but the President and the Senate, with their two\r\nendowments, pocket them; the benefit to France is zero. Credit Foncier?\r\nno capital forthcoming. Railways? they are decreed, and then laid\r\naside. It is the same with all these things as with the working-men's\r\ncities. Louis Bonaparte subscribes, but does not pay. As for the\r\nbudget, the budget controlled by the blind men in the Council of State,\r\nand voted by the dumb men in the Corps Législatif, there is an abyss\r\nbeneath it. There was no possible or efficacious budget but a great\r\nreduction in the army: two hundred thousand soldiers left at home, two\r\nhundred millions saved. Just try to touch the army! the soldier, who\r\nwould regain his freedom, would applaud, but what would the officer\r\nsay? And in reality, it is not the soldier but the officer who is\r\ncaressed. Then Paris and Lyons must be guarded, and all the other\r\ncities; and afterwards, when we are Emperor, a little European war must\r\nbe got up. Behold the gulf!\r\n\r\nIf from financial questions we pass to political institutions, oh!\r\nthere the neo-Bonapartists flourish abundantly, there are the\r\ncreations! Good heavens, what creations! A Constitution in the style of\r\nRavrio,--we have been examining it,--ornamented with palm-leaves and\r\nswans' necks, borne to the Élysée with old easy-chairs in the carriages\r\nof the _garde-meuble_; the Conservative Senate restitched and regilded,\r\nthe Council of State of 1806 refurbished and new-bordered with fresh\r\nlace; the old Corps Législatif patched up, with new nails and fresh\r\npaint, minus Lainé and plus Morny! In lieu of liberty of the press, the\r\nbureau of public spirit; in place of individual liberty, the ministry\r\nof police. All these \"institutions,\" which we have passed in review,\r\nare nothing more than the old salon furniture of the Empire. Beat it,\r\ndust it, sweep away the cobwebs, splash it over with stains of French\r\nblood, and you have the establishment of 1852. This bric-à-brac governs\r\nFrance. These are the creations!\r\n\r\nWhere is common sense? where is reason? where is truth? Not a sound\r\nside of contemporary intelligence that has not received a shock, not a\r\njust conquest of the age that has not been thrown down and broken. All\r\nsorts of extravagance become possible. All that we have seen since the\r\n2nd of December is a gallop, through all that is absurd, of a\r\ncommonplace man broken loose.\r\n\r\nThese individuals, the malefactor and his accomplices, are in\r\npossession of immense, incomparable, absolute, unlimited power,\r\nsufficient, we repeat, to change the whole face of Europe. They make\r\nuse of it only for amusement. To enjoy and to enrich themselves, such\r\nis their \"socialism.\" They have stopped the budget on the public\r\nhighway; the coffers are open; they fill their money-bags: they have\r\nmoney,--do you want some, here you are! All the salaries are doubled or\r\ntrebled; we have given the figures above. Three ministers, Turgot (for\r\nthere is a Turgot in this affair), Persigny and Maupas, have a million\r\neach of secret funds; the Senate a million, the Council of State half a\r\nmillion, the officers of the 2nd of December have a Napoleon-month,\r\nthat is to say, millions; the soldiers of the 2nd of December have\r\nmedals, that is to say, millions; M. Murat wants millions and will have\r\nthem; a minister gets married,--quick, half a million; M. Bonaparte,\r\n_quia nominor Poleo_, has twelve millions, plus four millions,--sixteen\r\nmillions. Millions, millions! This regime is called Million. M.\r\nBonaparte has three hundred horses for private use, the fruit and\r\nvegetables of the national domains, and parks and gardens formerly\r\nroyal; he is stuffed to repletion; he said the other day: \"all my\r\ncarriages,\" as Charles V said: \"all my Spains,\" and as Peter the Great\r\nsaid: \"all my Russias.\" The marriage of Gamache is celebrated at the\r\nÉlysée; the spits are turning day and night before the fireworks;\r\naccording to the bulletins published on the subject, the bulletins of\r\nthe new Empire, they consume there six hundred and fifty pounds of meat\r\nevery day; the Élysée will soon have one hundred and forty-nine\r\nkitchens, like the Castle of Schönbrunn; they drink, they eat, they\r\nlaugh, they feast; banquet at all the ministers', banquet at the École\r\nMilitaire, banquet at the Hotel de Ville, banquet at the Tuileries, a\r\nmonster fête on the 10th of May, a still more monster fête on the 15th\r\nof August; they swim in all sorts of abundance and intoxication. And\r\nthe man of the people, the poor day-labourer who is out of work, the\r\npauper in rags, with bare feet, to whom summer brings no bread, and\r\nwinter no wood, whose old mother lies in agony upon a rotten mattress,\r\nwhose daughter walks the streets for a livelihood, whose little\r\nchildren are shivering with hunger, fever and cold, in the hovels of\r\nFaubourg Saint-Marceau, in the cock-lofts of Rouen, and in the cellars\r\nof Lille, does any one think of him? What is to become of him? What is\r\ndone for him? Let him die like a dog!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE TWO PROFILES OF M. BONAPARTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curious part of it is that they are desirous of being respected; a\r\ngeneral is venerable, a minister is sacred. The Countess d'Andl----, a\r\nyoung woman of Brussels, was at Paris in March, 1852, and was one day\r\nin a salon in Faubourg Saint-Honoré when M. de P. entered. Madame\r\nd'Andl----, as she went out, passed before him, and it happened that,\r\nthinking probably of something else, she shrugged her shoulders. M. de\r\nP. noticed it; the following day Madame d'Andl---- was apprised, that\r\nhenceforward, under pain of being expelled from France like a\r\nrepresentative of the people, she must abstain from every mark of\r\napprobation or disapprobation when she happened to meet a minister.\r\n\r\nUnder this corporal-government, and under this countersign-constitution,\r\neverything proceeds in military form. The French people consult the\r\norder of the day to know how they must get up, how they must go to bed,\r\nhow they must dress, in what toilette they may go to the sitting of the\r\ncourt, or to the soirée of the prefect; they are forbidden to make\r\nmediocre verses; to wear beards; the frill and the white cravat are\r\nlaws of state. Rule, discipline, passive obedience, eyes cast down,\r\nsilence in the ranks; such is the yoke under which bows at this moment\r\nthe nation of initiative and of liberty, the great revolutionary\r\nFrance. The reformer will not stop until France shall be enough of a\r\nbarrack for the generals to exclaim: \"Good!\" and enough of a seminary\r\nfor the bishops to say: \"That will do!\"\r\n\r\nDo you like soldiers? they are to be found everywhere. The Municipal\r\nCouncil of Toulouse gives in its resignation; the Prefect\r\nChapuis-Montlaville replaces the mayor by a colonel, the first deputy\r\nby a colonel, and the second deputy by a colonel.[1] Military men take\r\nthe inside of the sidewalk. \"The soldiers,\" says Mably, \"considering\r\nthemselves in the place of the citizens who formerly made the consuls,\r\nthe dictators, the censors, and the tribunes, associated with the\r\ngovernment of the emperors a species of military democracy.\" Have you a\r\nshako on your head? then do what you please. A young man returning from\r\na ball, passed through Rue de Richelieu before the gate of the National\r\nLibrary; the sentinel took aim at him and killed him; the journals of\r\nthe following morning said: \"The young man is dead,\" and there it\r\nended. Timour Bey granted to his companions-in-arms, and to their\r\ndescendants to the seventh generation, impunity for all crimes\r\nwhatsoever, provided the delinquent had not committed a crime nine\r\ntimes. The sentinel of Rue Richelieu has, therefore, eight citizens\r\nmore to kill before he can be brought before a court-martial. It is a\r\ngood thing to be a soldier, but not so good to be a citizen. At the\r\nsame time, however, this unfortunate army is dishonoured. On the 3rd of\r\nDecember, they decorated the police officers who arrested its\r\nrepresentatives and its generals; though it is equally true that the\r\nsoldiers themselves received two louis per man. Oh, shame on every\r\nside! money to the soldiers, and the cross to the police spies!\r\n\r\n      [1] These three colonels are MM. Cailhassou, Dubarry and\r\n      Policarpe.\r\n\r\nJesuitism and corporalism, this is the sum total of the regime. The\r\nwhole political theory of M. Bonaparte is composed of two\r\nhypocrisies--a military hypocrisy towards the army, a catholic\r\nhypocrisy towards the clergy. When it is not _Fracasse_ it is _Basile_.\r\nSometimes it is both together. In this manner he succeeded wonderfully\r\nin duping at the same time Montalembert, who does not believe in\r\nFrance, and Saint-Arnaud who does not believe in God.\r\n\r\nDoes the Dictator smell of incense? Does he smell of tobacco? Smell\r\nand see. He smells of both tobacco and incense. Oh, France! what a\r\ngovernment is this! The spurs pass by beneath the cassock. The _coup\r\nd'état_ goes to mass, thrashes the civilians, reads its breviary,\r\nembraces Catin, tells its beads, empties the wine pots, and takes the\r\nsacrament. The _coup d'état_ asserts, what is doubtful, that we have\r\ngone back to the time of the _Jacqueries_; but this much is certain,\r\nthat it takes us back to the time of the Crusades. Cæsar goes crusading\r\nfor the Pope. _Diex el volt._ The Élysée has the faith, and the thirst\r\nalso, of the Templar.\r\n\r\nTo enjoy and to live well, we repeat, and to consume the budget; to\r\nbelieve nothing, to make the most of everything; to compromise at once\r\ntwo sacred things, military honour and religious faith; to stain the\r\naltar with blood and the standard with holy water; to make the soldier\r\nridiculous, and the priest a little ferocious; to mix up with that\r\ngreat political fraud which he calls his power, the Church and the\r\nnation, the conscience of the Catholic and the conscience of the\r\npatriot. This is the system of Bonaparte the Little.\r\n\r\nAll his acts, from the most monstrous to the most puerile, from that\r\nwhich is hideous to that which is laughable, are stamped with this\r\ntwofold scheme. For instance, national solemnities bore him. The 24th\r\nof February and the 4th of May: these are disagreeable or dangerous\r\nreminders, which obstinately return at fixed periods. An anniversary is\r\nan intruder; let us suppress anniversaries. So be it. We will keep but\r\none birthday, our own. Excellent. But with one fête only how are two\r\nparties to be satisfied--the soldier party and the priest party? The\r\nsoldier party is Voltairian. Where Canrobert smiles, Riancey makes a\r\nwry face. What's to be done? You shall see. Your great jugglers are not\r\nembarrassed by such a trifle. The _Moniteur one fine morning declares\r\nthat there will be henceforth but one national fête, the 15th of\r\nAugust. Hereupon a semi-official commentary: the two masks of the\r\nDictator begin to speak. \"The 15th of August,\" says the _Ratapoil\r\nmouth, \"Saint Napoleon's day!\" \"The 15th of August,\" says the\r\n_Tartuffe mouth, \"the fête of the Holy Virgin!\" On one side the\r\nSecond-of-December puffs out its cheeks, magnifies its voice, draws its\r\nlong sabre and exclaims: \"_Sacre-bleu, grumblers! Let us celebrate the\r\nbirthday of Napoleon the Great!\" On the other, it casts down its eyes,\r\nmakes the sign of the cross, and mumbles: \"My very dear brethren, let\r\nus adore the sacred heart of Mary!\"\r\n\r\nThe present government is a hand stained with blood, which dips a\r\nfinger in the holy water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we are asked: \"Are you going a little too far? are you not unjust?\r\nGrant him something. Has he not to a certain extent 'made Socialism?'\"\r\nand the Credit Foncier, the railroads, and the lowering of the interest\r\nare brought upon the carpet.\r\n\r\nWe have already estimated these measures at their proper value; but,\r\nwhile we admit that this is \"Socialism,\" you would be simpletons to\r\nascribe the credit to M. Bonaparte. It is not he who has made\r\nsocialism, but time.\r\n\r\nA man is swimming against a rapid current; he struggles with unheard-of\r\nefforts, he buffets the waves with hand and head, and shoulder, and\r\nknee. You say: \"He will succeed in going up.\" A moment after, you look,\r\nand he has gone farther down. He is much farther down the river than he\r\nwas when he started. Without knowing, or even suspecting it, he loses\r\nground at every effort he makes; he fancies that he is ascending the\r\nstream, and he is constantly descending it. He thinks he is advancing,\r\nbut he is falling hack. Falling credit, as you say, lowering of\r\ninterest, as you say; M. Bonaparte has already made several of those\r\ndecrees which you choose to qualify as socialistic, and he will make\r\nmore. M. Changarnier, had he triumphed instead of M. Bonaparte, would\r\nhave done as much. Henry V, should he return to-morrow, would do the\r\nsame. The Emperor of Austria does it in Galicia, and the Emperor\r\nNicholas in Lithuania. But after all, what does this prove? that the\r\ntorrent which is called Revolution is stronger than the swimmer who is\r\ncalled Despotism.\r\n\r\nBut even this socialism of M. Bonaparte, what is it? This, socialism? I\r\ndeny it. Hatred of the middle class it may be, but not socialism. Look\r\nat the socialist department _par excellence_, the Department of\r\nAgriculture and of Commerce,--he has abolished it. What has he given\r\nyou as compensation? the Ministry of Police! The other socialist\r\ndepartment is the Department of Public Instruction, and that is in\r\ndanger: one of these days it will be suppressed. The starting-point of\r\nsocialism is education, gratuitous and obligatory teaching, knowledge.\r\nTo take the children and make men of them, to take the men and make\r\ncitizens of them--intelligent, honest, useful, and happy citizens.\r\nIntellectual and moral progress first, and material progress after. The\r\ntwo first, irresistibly and of themselves, bring on the last. What does\r\nM. Bonaparte do? He persecutes and stifles instruction everywhere.\r\nThere is one pariah in our France of the present day, and that is the\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nHave you ever reflected on what a schoolmaster really is--on that\r\nmagistracy in which the tyrants of old took shelter, like criminals in\r\nthe temple, a certain refuge? Have you ever thought of what that man is\r\nwho teaches children? You enter the workshop of a wheelwright; he is\r\nmaking wheels and shafts; you say, \"this is a useful man;\" you enter a\r\nweaver's, who is making cloth; you say, \"this is a valuable man;\" you\r\nenter the blacksmith's shop; he is making pick-axes, hammers, and\r\nploughshares; you say, \"this is a necessary man;\" you salute these men,\r\nthese skilful labourers. You enter the house of a schoolmaster,--salute\r\nhim more profoundly; do you know what he is doing? he is manufacturing\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nHe is the wheelwright, the weaver, and the blacksmith of the work, in\r\nwhich he is aiding God,--the future.\r\n\r\nWell! to-day, thanks to the reigning clerical party, as the\r\nschoolmaster must not be allowed to work for this future, as this\r\nfuture is to consist of darkness and degradation, not of intelligence\r\nand light,--do you wish to know in what manner this humble and great\r\nmagistrate, the schoolmaster, is made to do his work? The schoolmaster\r\nserves mass, sings in the choir, rings the vesper bell, arranges the\r\nseats, renews the flowers before the sacred heart, furbishes the altar\r\ncandlesticks, dusts the tabernacle, folds the copes and the chasubles,\r\ncounts and keeps in order the linen of the sacristy, puts oil in the\r\nlamps, beats the cushion of the confessional, sweeps out the church,\r\nand sometimes the rectory; the remainder of his time, on condition that\r\nhe does not pronounce either of those three words of the devil,\r\nCountry, Republic, Liberty, he may employ, if he thinks proper, in\r\nteaching little children to say their A, B, C.\r\n\r\nM. Bonaparte strikes at instruction at the same moment above and below:\r\nbelow, to please the priests, above, to please the bishops. At the same\r\ntime that he is trying to close the village school, he mutilates the\r\nCollège de France. He overturns with one blow the professors' chairs of\r\nQuinet and of Michelet. One fine morning, he declares, by decree, Greek\r\nand Latin to be under suspicion, and, so far as he can, forbids all\r\nintercourse with the ancient poets and historians of Athens and of\r\nRome, scenting in Æschylus and in Tacitus a vague odour of demagogy.\r\nWith a stroke of the pen, for instance, he exempts all medical men from\r\nliterary qualification, which causes Doctor Serres to say: \"_We are\r\ndispensed, by decree, from knowing how to read and write._\"\r\n\r\nNew taxes, sumptuary taxes, vestiary taxes; _nemo audeat comedere\r\npraeter duo fercula cum potagio_; tax on the living, tax on the\r\ndead, tax on successions, tax on carriages, tax on paper. \"Bravo!\"\r\nshouts the beadle party, \"fewer books; tax upon dogs, the collars will\r\npay; tax upon senators, the armorial bearings will pay.\"--\"All this\r\nwill make me popular!\" says M. Bonaparte, rubbing his hands. \"He is the\r\nsocialist Emperor,\" vociferate the trusty partisans of the faubourgs.\r\n\"He is the Catholic Emperor,\" murmur the devout in the sacristies. How\r\nhappy he would be if he could pass in the latter for Constantine, and\r\nin the former for Babeuf! Watchwords are repeated, adhesion is\r\ndeclared, enthusiasm spreads from one to another, the École Militaire\r\ndraws his cypher with bayonets and pistol-barrels, Abbé Gaume and\r\nCardinal Gousset applaud, his bust is crowned with flowers in the\r\nmarket, Nanterre dedicates rosebushes to him, social order is certainly\r\nsaved, property, family, and religion breathe again, and the police\r\nerect a statue to him.\r\n\r\nOf bronze?\r\n\r\nFie! that may do for the uncle.\r\n\r\nOf marble! _Tu es Pietri et super hanc pietram aedificabo effigiem\r\nmeam._[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] We read in the Bonapartist correspondence:--\"The committee\r\n      appointed by the clerks of the prefecture of police, considers\r\n      that bronze is not worthy to represent the image of the Prince;\r\n      it will therefore be executed in marble; and it will be placed on\r\n      a marble pedestal. The following inscription will be cut in the\r\n      costly and superb stone: 'Souvenir of the oath of fidelity to the\r\n      Prince-President, taken by the clerks of the prefecture of\r\n      police, the 29th of May, 1862, before M.

It\r\n      is calculated that this subscription will amount to upwards of\r\n      6,000 francs.\"\r\n\r\nThat which he attacks, that which he persecutes, that which they all\r\npersecute with him, upon which they pounce, which they wish to crush,\r\nto burn, to suppress, to destroy, to annihilate, is it this poor\r\nobscure man who is called primary instructor? Is it this sheet of paper\r\nthat is called a journal? Is it this bundle of sheets which is called a\r\nbook? Is it this machine of wood and iron which is called a press? No,\r\nit is thou, thought, it is thou, human reason, it is thou, nineteenth\r\ncentury, it is thou, Providence, it is thou, God!\r\n\r\nWe who combat them are \"the eternal enemies of order.\" We are--for they\r\ncan as yet find nothing but this worn-out word--we are demagogues.\r\n\r\nIn the language of the Duke of Alva, to believe in the sacredness of\r\nthe human conscience, to resist the Inquisition, to brave the state for\r\none's faith, to draw the sword for one's country, to defend one's\r\nworship, one's city, one's home, one's house, one's family, and one's\r\nGod, was called _vagabondism_; in the language of Louis Bonaparte, to\r\nstruggle for freedom, for justice, for the right, to fight in the cause\r\nof progress, of civilisation, of France, of mankind, to wish for the\r\nabolition of war, and of the penalty of death, to take _au sérieux_ the\r\nfraternity of men, to believe in a plighted oath, to take up arms for\r\nthe constitution of one's country, to defend the laws,--this is called\r\n_demagogy_.\r\n\r\nThe man is a demagogue in the nineteenth century, who in the sixteenth\r\nwould have been a vagabond.\r\n\r\nThis much being granted, that the dictionary of the Academy no longer\r\nexists, that it is night at noonday, that a cat is no longer called\r\ncat, and that Baroche is no longer called a knave; that justice is a\r\nchimera, that history is a dream, that the Prince of Orange was a\r\nvagabond, and the Duke of Alva a just man; that Louis Bonaparte is\r\nidentical with Napoleon the Great, that they who have violated the\r\nConstitution are saviours, and that they who defended it are\r\nbrigands,--in a word that human probity is dead: very good! in that\r\ncase I admire this government It works well. It is a model of its\r\nspecies. It compresses, it represses, it oppresses, it imprisons, it\r\nexiles, it shoots down with grape-shot, it exterminates, and it even\r\n\"pardons!\" It exercises authority with cannon-balls, and clemency with\r\nthe flat of the sabre.\r\n\r\n\"At your pleasure,\" repeat some worthy incorrigibles of the former\r\nparty of order, \"be indignant, rail, stigmatize, disavow,--'tis all the\r\nsame to us; long live stability! All these things put together\r\nconstitute, after all, a stable government.\"\r\n\r\nStable! We have already expressed ourselves on the subject of this\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nStability! I admire such stability. If it rained newspapers in France\r\nfor two days only, on the morning of the third nobody would know what\r\nhad become of M. Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nNo matter; this man is a burden upon the whole age, he disfigures the\r\nnineteenth century, and there will be in this century, perhaps, two or\r\nthree years upon which it will be recognised, by some shameful mark or\r\nother, that Louis Bonaparte sat down upon them.\r\n\r\nThis person, we grieve to say it, is now the question that occupies all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nAt certain epochs in history, the whole human race, from all points of\r\nthe earth, fix their eyes upon some mysterious spot whence it seems\r\nthat universal destiny is about to issue. There have been hours when\r\nthe world has looked towards the Vatican: Gregory VII and Leo X\r\noccupied the pontifical throne; other hours, when it has contemplated\r\nthe Louvre; Philip Augustus, Louis IX, François I, and Henri IV were\r\nthere; the Escorial, Saint-Just: Charles V dreamed there; Windsor:\r\nElizabeth the Great reigned there; Versailles: Louis XIV shone there\r\nsurrounded by stars; the Kremlin: one caught a glimpse there of Peter\r\nthe Great; Potsdam: Frederick II was closeted there with Voltaire. At\r\npresent, history, bow thy head, the whole universe is looking at the\r\nÉlysée!\r\n\r\nThat species of bastard door, guarded by two sentry-boxes painted on\r\ncanvas, at the extremity of Faubourg Saint-Honoré, that is the spot\r\ntowards which the eyes of the civilized world are now turned with a\r\nsort of profound anxiety! Ah! what sort of place is that, whence no\r\nidea has issued that has not been a plot, no action that has not been a\r\ncrime? What sort of place is that wherein reside all kinds of cynicism\r\nand all kinds of hypocrisy? What sort of place is that where bishops\r\nelbow Jeanne Poisson on the staircase, and, as a hundred years ago, bow\r\nto the ground before her; where Samuel Bernard laughs in a corner with\r\nLaubardemont; which Escobar enters, arm-in-arm with Guzman d'Alfarache;\r\nwhere (frightful rumour), in a thicket in the garden, they despatch, it\r\nis said, with the bayonet men whom they dare not bring to trial; where\r\none hears a man say to a woman who is weeping and interceding: \"I\r\noverlook your love-affairs, you must overlook my hatreds!\" What sort of\r\nplace is that where the orgies of 1852 intrude upon and dishonour the\r\nmourning of 1815! where Cæsarion, with his arms crossed, or his hands\r\nbehind his back, walks under those very trees, and in those very\r\navenues still haunted by the indignant phantom of Cæsar?\r\n\r\nThat place is the blot upon Paris; that place is the pollution of the\r\nage; that door, whence issue all sorts of joyous sounds, flourishes of\r\ntrumpets, music, laughter, and the jingling of glasses; that door,\r\nsaluted during the day by the passing battalions; illuminated at night;\r\nthrown wide open with insolent confidence,--is a sort of public insult\r\nalways present. There is the centre of the world's shame.\r\n\r\nAlas! of what is France thinking? Of a surety, we must awake this\r\nslumbering nation, we must take it by the arm, we must shake it, we\r\nmust speak to it; we must scour the fields, enter the villages, go into\r\nthe barracks, speak to the soldier who no longer knows what he is\r\ndoing, speak to the labourer who has in his cabin an engraving of the\r\nEmperor, and who, for that reason, votes for everything they ask; we\r\nmust remove the radiant phantom that dazzles their eyes; this whole\r\nsituation is nothing but a huge and deadly joke. We must expose this\r\njoke, probe it to the bottom, disabuse the people,--the country people\r\nabove all,--excite them, agitate them, stir them up, show them the\r\nempty houses, the yawning graves, and make them touch with their finger\r\nthe horror of this régime. The people are good and honest; they will\r\ncomprehend. Yes, peasant, there are two, the great and the little, the\r\nillustrious and the infamous,--Napoleon and Naboleon!\r\n\r\nLet us sum up this government! Who is at the Élysée and the Tuileries?\r\nCrime. Who is established at the Luxembourg? Baseness. Who at the\r\nPalais Bourbon? Imbecility. Who at the Palais d'Orsay? Corruption. Who\r\nat the Palais de Justice? Prevarication. And who are in the prisons, in\r\nthe fortresses, in the dungeons, in the casemates, in the hulks, at\r\nLambessa, at Cayenne, in exile? Law, honour, intelligence, liberty, and\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nOh! ye proscribed, of what do you complain? You have the better part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this government, this horrible, hypocritical, and stupid\r\ngovernment,--this government which causes us to hesitate between a\r\nlaugh and a sob, this gibbet-constitution on which all our liberties\r\nare hung, this great universal suffrage and this little universal\r\nsuffrage, the first naming the President, and the other the\r\nlegislators; the little one saying to the great one: \"_Monseigneur,\r\naccept these millions_,\" and the great one saying to the little one:\r\n\"_Be assured of my consideration_;\" this Senate,--this Council of\r\nState--whence do they all come? Great Heaven! have we already reached\r\nthe point that it is necessary to remind the reader of their source?\r\n\r\nWhence comes this government? Look! It is still flowing, it is still\r\nsmoking,--it is blood!\r\n\r\nThe dead are far away, the dead are dead.\r\n\r\nAh! it is horrible to think and to say, but is it possible that we no\r\nlonger think of it?\r\n\r\nIs it possible that, because we still eat and drink, because the\r\ncoachmakers' trade is flourishing, because you, labourer, have work in\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne, because you, mason, earn forty sous a day at the\r\nLouvre, because you, banker, have made money in the mining shares of\r\nVienna, or in the obligations of Hope and Co., because the titles of\r\nnobility are restored, because one can now be called _Monsieur le\r\nComte_ or _Madame la Duchesse_, because religious processions traverse\r\nthe streets on the Fête-Dieu, because people enjoy themselves, because\r\nthey laugh, because the walls of Paris are covered with bills of fêtes\r\nand theatres,--is it possible that, because these things are so, men\r\nforgot that there are corpses lying beneath?\r\n\r\nIs it possible, that, because one has been to the ball at the École\r\nMilitaire, because one has returned home with dazzled eyes, aching\r\nhead, torn dress and faded bouquet, because one has thrown one's self\r\non one's couch, and fallen asleep, thinking of some handsome\r\nofficer,--is it possible that one no longer remembers that under the\r\nturf, in an obscure grave, in a deep pit, in the inexorable gloom of\r\ndeath, there lies a motionless, ice-cold, terrible multitude,--a\r\nmultitude of human beings already become a shapeless mass, devoured by\r\nworms, consumed by corruption, and beginning to blend with the earth\r\naround them--who existed, worked, thought, and loved, who had the right\r\nto live, and who were murdered?\r\n\r\nAh! if men recollect this no longer, let us recall it to the minds of\r\nthose who forget! Awake, you who sleep! The dead are about to pass\r\nbefore your eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM AN UNPUBLISHED BOOK ENTITLED\r\n\r\nTHE CRIME OF THE SECOND OF DECEMBER[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE DAY OF THE 4th OF DECEMBER\r\n\r\n\"THE COUP D'ÉTAT AT BAY\r\n\r\n      [1] By Victor Hugo. This book will shortly be published. It will\r\n      be a complete narrative of the infamous performance of 1851. A\r\n      large part of it is already written; the author is at this moment\r\n      collecting materials for the rest.\r\n\r\n      He deems it apropos to enter somewhat at length into the details\r\n      of this work, which he has imposed upon himself as a duty.\r\n\r\n      The author does himself the justice to believe that in writing\r\n      this narrative,--the serious occupation of his exile,--he has had\r\n      constantly present to his mind the exalted responsibility of the\r\n      historian.\r\n\r\n      When it shall appear, this narrative will surely arouse numerous\r\n      and violent outcries; the author expects no less; one does not\r\n      with impunity cut to the quick of a contemporaneous crime, at the\r\n      moment when that crime is omnipotent. However that may be, and\r\n      however violent the outcries, more or less interested, and to the\r\n      end that we may judge beforehand of its merit, the author feels\r\n      called upon to explain in what way and with what scrupulous\r\n      devotion to the truth this narrative will have been written, or,\r\n      to speak more accurately, this report of the crime will have been\r\n      drawn. This history of the 2nd of December will contain, in\r\n      addition to the general facts, which everybody knows, a very\r\n      large number of unknown facts which are brought to light for the\r\n      first time therein. Several of these facts the author himself saw\r\n      and touched and passed through; of them he can say: _Quoeque\r\n      ipse vidi et quorum pars fui._ The members of the Republican\r\n      Left, whose conduct was so fearless, saw these facts as he did,\r\n      and he will not lack their testimony. For all the rest, the\r\n      author has resorted to a veritable judicial investigation; he has\r\n      constituted himself, so to speak, the examining magistrate of the\r\n      performance; every actor in the drama, every combatant, every\r\n      victim, every witness has deposed before him; for all the\r\n      doubtful facts, he has brought the opposing declarations, and at\r\n      need the witnesses, face to face. As a general rule historians\r\n      deal with dead facts; they touch them in the tomb with their\r\n      judicial wands, cause them to rise and question them. He has\r\n      dealt with living facts.\r\n\r\n      All the details of the 2nd of December have in this wise passed\r\n      before his eyes; he has recorded them all, weighed them all--not\r\n      one has escaped him. History will be able to complete this\r\n      narration, but not to weaken it. The magistrates were recreant to\r\n      their trust, he has performed their functions. When direct,\r\n      spoken testimony has failed him, he has sent to the spot what one\r\n      might call genuine investigating commissions. He might cite many\r\n      a fact for which he has prepared genuine interrogatories to which\r\n      detailed replies were made. He repeats that he has subjected the\r\n      2nd of December to a long and severe examination. He has carried\r\n      the torch so far as he was able. Thanks to this investigation he\r\n      has in his possession nearly two hundred reports from which the\r\n      book in question will emerge. There is not a single fact beneath\r\n      which, when the book is published, the author will not be able to\r\n      put a name. It will be readily understood that he will abstain\r\n      from doing so, that he will even substitute sometimes for the\r\n      real names, yes and for accurate indications of places,\r\n      designations as obscure as possible, in view of the pending\r\n      proscriptions. He has no desire to furnish M. Bonaparte with a\r\n      supplemental list.\r\n\r\n      It is undoubtedly true that in this narrative of the 2nd of\r\n      December, the author is not, any more than in this present book,\r\n      \"impartial,\" as people are accustomed to say of a history when\r\n      they wish to praise the historian. Impartiality--a strange\r\n      virtue, which Tacitus does not possess. Woe to him who should\r\n      remain impartial in face of the bleeding wounds of liberty! In\r\n      presence of the deed of December 2nd, 1851, the author feels that\r\n      all human nature rises to arms within his breast; he does not\r\n      conceal it from himself, and every one should perceive it when\r\n      reading him. But in him the passion for truth equals the passion\r\n      for right. The wrathful man does not lie. This history of the 2nd\r\n      of December, therefore,--he declares as he is about to quote a\r\n      few pages of it,--will have been written, we have just seen by\r\n      what method, under conditions of the most absolute reality.\r\n\r\n      We deem it profitable to detach from it and to publish in this\r\n      place a chapter which, we think, will make an impression on men's\r\n      minds, in that it casts a new light on the \"success\" of M.\r\n      Bonaparte. Thanks to the judicious reticences of the official\r\n      historiographers of the 2nd of December, people are not\r\n      sufficiently apprised how near the _coup d'état_ came to being\r\n      abortive, and they are altogether ignorant as to the means by\r\n      which it was saved. We proceed to place this special detail\r\n      before the reader's eyes.\r\n\r\n      [The author has concluded to reserve for this book alone the\r\n      chapter in question which now forms an integral part thereof. He\r\n      has therefore rewritten for the _History of a Crime_, the\r\n      narrative of the events of December 4, with new facts, and from\r\n      another point of view.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The resistance had assumed unexpected proportions.\r\n\r\n\"The combat had become menacing; it was no longer a combat, but a\r\nbattle, which was engaged on all sides. At the Élysée and the different\r\ndepartments, people began to turn pale; they had wished for barricades,\r\nand they had got them.\r\n\r\n\"All the centre of Paris was becoming covered with improvised redoubts;\r\nthe quarters thus barricaded formed a sort of immense trapezium,\r\nbetween the Halles and Rue Rambuteau on one side, and the boulevards on\r\nthe other; bounded on the east by Rue du Temple, and on the west by Rue\r\nMontmartre. This vast network of streets, cut in all directions by\r\nredoubts and entrenchments, assumed every hour a more terrible aspect,\r\nand was becoming a kind of fortress. The combatants at the barricades\r\npushed their advance guards as far as the quays. Outside the trapezium,\r\nwhich we have described, the barricades extended, as we have said, as\r\nfar as Faubourg Saint-Martin, and to the neighbourhood of the canal.\r\nThe quarter of the schools, whither the Committee of Resistance had\r\ndespatched Representative de Flotte, had risen even more generally than\r\non the evening before; the suburbs were taking fire; the drums were\r\nbeating to arms at the Batignolles; Madier de Montjau was arousing\r\nBelleville; three enormous barricades were in course of construction at\r\nthe Chapelle-Saint-Denis. In the business streets the citizens were\r\ndelivering up their muskets, and the women were making lint. 'All is\r\ngoing well! Paris is up!' exclaimed B----, to us, as he entered the\r\nCommittee of Resistance with a face radiant with joy.[2] Fresh\r\nintelligence reached us every instant; all the permanent committees of\r\nthe different quarters placed themselves in communication with us. The\r\nmembers of the committee deliberated and issued orders and instructions\r\nfor the combat in every direction. Victory seemed certain. There was a\r\nmoment of enthusiasm and joy when all these men, still standing between\r\nlife and death, embraced one another.--'Now,' exclaimed Jules Favre,\r\n'let but a regiment come over, or a legion, and Louis Bonaparte is\r\nlost!'--'To-morrow, the Republic will be at the Hotel de Ville!' said\r\nMichel de Bourges. All was ferment, all was excitement; in the most\r\npeaceful quarters the proclamations were torn down, and the ordinances\r\ndefaced. On Rue Beaubourg, the women cried from the windows to the men\r\nemployed in erecting a barricade: 'Courage!' The agitation reached even\r\nto Faubourg Saint-Germain. At the headquarters on Rue de Jerusalem,\r\nwhich is the centre of the great cobweb that the police spreads over\r\nParis, everyone trembled; their anxiety was immense, for they saw the\r\npossibility that the Republic would triumph. In the courtyards, in the\r\nbureaus, and in the passages, the clerks and sergents-de-ville began to\r\ntalk with affectionate regret of Caussidiere.\r\n\r\n      [2] A Committee of Resistance, charged with the task of\r\n      centralizing the action and directing the combat, had been named\r\n      on the evening of the 2nd of December, by the members of the Left\r\n      assembled at the house of Representative Lafon, Quai Jemmappes,\r\n      No. 2. This committee, which was obliged to change its retreat\r\n      twenty-seven times in four days, and which, so to say, sat night\r\n      and day, and did not cease to act for a single instant during\r\n      the various crises of the _coup d'état_, was composed of\r\n      Representatives Carnot, de Flotte, Jules Favre, Madier de\r\n      Montjau, Michel de Bourges, Schoelcher, and Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\n\"If one can believe what has oozed out from this den, the prefect,\r\nMaupas, who had been so warm in the cause the evening before, and was\r\nput forward so odiously, began to back out and lose courage. It seemed\r\nas if he were listening with terror to the noise, as of a rising flood,\r\nmade by the insurrection--by the holy and legitimate insurrection of\r\nthe right. He stammered and hesitated while the word of command died\r\naway upon his tongue. 'That poor young man has the colic,' said the\r\nformer prefect, Carlier, on leaving him. In this state of consternation,\r\nMaupas clung to Morny. The electric telegraph maintained a perpetual\r\ndialogue from the Prefecture of Police to the Department of the\r\nInterior, and from the Department of the Interior to the Prefecture of\r\nPolice. All the most alarming news, all the signs of panic and\r\nconfusion were passed on, one after another, from the prefect to the\r\nminister. Morny, who was less frightened, and who is, at least, a man\r\nof spirit, received all these shocks in his cabinet It is reported that\r\nat the first communication he said: 'Maupas is ill;' and to the\r\nquestion: 'What is to be done,' replied by the telegraph: 'Go to bed!'\r\nTo the second question he still replied: 'Go to bed!' and, as the\r\nthird, losing all patience he answered: 'Go to bed and be d----d!'\r\n\r\n\"The zeal of the government agents was fast giving way and beginning to\r\nchange sides. A courageous man, who had been despatched by the\r\nCommittee of Resistance to rouse Faubourg Saint-Marceau, was arrested\r\non Rue des Fossés-Saint-Victor, with his pockets filled with the\r\nproclamations and decrees of the Left. He was immediately marched off\r\nin the direction of the Prefecture of Police. He expected to be shot.\r\nAs the escort which was conducting him passed the Morgue on\r\nQuai-Saint-Michel, musket-shots were heard in the Cité. The\r\nsergent-de-ville at the head of the escort said to the soldiers: 'Go\r\nback to your guard-house; I will take care of the prisoner,' As soon as\r\nthe soldiers were gone, he cut the cords with which the prisoner's\r\nhands were fastened, and said to him: 'Go, I spare your life; don't\r\nforget that it was I who set you at liberty. Look at me well, so that\r\nyou may know me again.'\r\n\r\n\"The principal military accomplices held a council. The question was\r\ndiscussed whether it was not necessary for Louis Bonaparte to quit\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré immediately, and remove either to the Invalides\r\nor to the Palais du Luxembourg, two strategic points more easy to\r\ndefend against a _coup de main_ than the Élysée. Some preferred\r\nthe Invalides, others the Luxembourg; the subject gave rise to an\r\naltercation between two generals.\r\n\r\n\"It was at this moment that the ex-King of Westphalia, Jérôme\r\nBonaparte, seeing that the _coup d'état_ was tottering to its fall,\r\nand having some care for the morrow, wrote his nephew the following\r\nsignificant letter:--\r\n\r\n                       *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    \"My dear Nephew,--The blood of Frenchmen has been spilt; stop its\r\n    effusion by a serious appeal to the people. Your sentiments are not\r\n    rightly understood. Your second proclamation, in which you speak of\r\n    the plebiscitum, is ill received by the people, who do not look\r\n    upon it as re-establishing the right of suffrage. Liberty possesses\r\n    no guarantee if there is not an Assembly to contribute to the\r\n    constitution of the Republic. The army has the upper hand. Now is\r\n    the moment to complete the material victory by a moral victory, and\r\n    that which a government cannot do when beaten, it ought to do when\r\n    victorious. After destroying the old parties, bring about the\r\n    restoration of the people; proclaim that universal suffrage,\r\n    sincere, and acting in harmony with the greatest liberty, shall\r\n    name the President and the Constituent Assembly to save and restore\r\n    the Republic.\r\n\r\n    \"It is in the name of my brother's memory, and sharing his horror\r\n    for civil war, that I now write to you; trust my long experience,\r\n    and remember that France, Europe, and posterity will be called on\r\n    to judge your conduct.\r\n\r\n    \"Your affectionate uncle,\r\n\r\n    \"JÉRÔME BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n                       *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"On Place de la Madeleine, the two representatives, Fabvier and\r\nCrestin, met and accosted each other. General Fabvier directed his\r\ncolleague's attention to four pieces of cannon which, turning in an\r\nopposite direction to that they had before been pursuing, left the\r\nBoulevard and galloped off towards the Élysée. 'Can it be that the\r\nÉlysée is already on the defensive?' said the general. Crestin,\r\npointing to the façade of the palate of the Assembly, on the other side\r\nof Place de la Révolution, replied: 'General, to-morrow we shall be\r\nthere.'--From, some garrets that look on the stables of the Élysée,\r\nthree travelling carriages were observed from an early hour in the\r\nmorning, loaded, with the horses put to, and the postilions in their\r\nsaddles ready to start.\r\n\r\n\"The impulsion was really given, the movement of rage and hatred was\r\nbecoming universal, and the _coup d'état_ seemed to be lost; one\r\nshock more and Louis Bonaparte would fall. Let the day but end as it\r\nhad begun, and all was over. The _coup d'état_ was approaching a\r\nstate of despair. The hour for supreme resolutions was come. What did\r\nhe intend doing? It was necessary that he should strike a great blow,\r\nan unexpected blow, a terrible blow. He was reduced to this\r\nalternative: to perish, or to save himself by a frightful expedient.\r\n\r\n\"Louis Bonaparte had not quitted the Élysée. He was in a cabinet on the\r\nground floor, near the splendid gilt saloon, where, as a child, in\r\n1815, he had been present at the second abdication of Napoleon. He was\r\nthere alone; orders had been given that no one should be allowed to\r\nhave access to him. From time to time the door was opened a little way,\r\nand the grey head of General Roguet, his aide-de-camp, appeared. The\r\ngeneral was the only person who was allowed to open this door and enter\r\nthe room. The general brought news, more and more alarming, and\r\nfrequently terminated what he had to say with the words: 'The thing\r\ndoesn't work;' or 'Things are going badly.' When he had finished, Louis\r\nBonaparte, who was seated with his elbows on a table and his feet on\r\nthe fire-dogs, before a roaring fire, turned his head half round on the\r\nback of his chair, and, in a most phlegmatic tone, and without apparent\r\nemotion, invariably answered in the following words: 'Let them execute\r\nmy orders.' The last time that General Roguet entered the room in this\r\nmanner with bad news, it was nearly one o'clock--he himself has related\r\nthese details, to the honour of his master's calmness. He told the\r\nPrince that the barricades in the centre of the town still held out,\r\nand were increasing in number; that on the boulevards the cries of\r\n'Down with the dictator' (he did not dare say 'Down with Soulouque'),\r\nand hisses everywhere hailed the troops as they passed; that before\r\nGalerie Jouffroy a major had been pursued by the crowd, and that at the\r\ncorner of the Café Cardinal a captain of the staff had been torn from\r\nhis horse. Louis Bonaparte half rose from his chair, and gazing fixedly\r\nat the general, calmly said to him: 'Very well! let Saint-Arnaud be\r\ntold to execute my orders.'\r\n\r\n\"What were these orders?\r\n\r\n\"We shall see.\r\n\r\n\"Here we pause to reflect, and the narrator lays down his pen with a\r\nspecies of hesitation and distress of mind. We are approaching the\r\nabominable crisis of that mournful day, the 4th; we are approaching\r\nthat monstrous deed from which emerged the success of the _coup\r\nd'état_, dripping with blood. We are about to unveil the most\r\nhorrible of the premeditated acts of Louis Bonaparte; we are about to\r\nreveal, to narrate, to describe what all the historiographers of the\r\n2nd of December have concealed; what General Magnan carefully omitted\r\nin his report; what, even at Paris, where these things were seen, men\r\nscarcely dare to whisper to each other. We are about to enter upon the\r\nghastly.\r\n\r\n\"The 2nd of December is a crime covered with darkness, a coffin closed\r\nand silent, from the cracks in which streams of blood gush forth.\r\n\r\n\"We are about to raise the coffin-lid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From an early hour in the morning,--for here (we insist upon this\r\npoint) premeditation is unquestionable,--from an early hour in the\r\nmorning, strange placards had been posted up at all the street-corners;\r\nwe have transcribed these placards, and our readers will remember them.\r\nDuring sixty years that the cannon of revolution have, on certain days,\r\nboomed through Paris, and that the government, when menaced, has had\r\nrecourse to desperate measures, nothing has ever been seen like these\r\nplacards. They informed the inhabitants that all assemblages, no matter\r\nof what kind, would be dispersed by armed force, _without previous\r\nwarning_. In Paris, the metropolis of civilization, people do not\r\neasily believe that a man will push his crime to the last extremity;\r\nand, therefore, these notices had been looked upon as a means of\r\nintimidation that was hideous and barbarous, but almost ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"The public were wrong. These placards contained in germ Louis\r\nBonaparte's whole plan. They were seriously meant.\r\n\r\n\"One word as to the spot which is about to be the theatre of the\r\nunheard-of drama, prepared and perpetrated by the man of December.\r\n\r\n\"From the Madeleine to Faubourg Poissonnière, the boulevard was\r\nunobstructed; from the Gymnase Theatre to the Theatre of the Porte\r\nSaint-Martin it was barricaded, as were Rue de Bondy, Rue Neslay, Rue\r\nde la Lune, and all the streets which bound, or debouch at, Porte\r\nSaint-Denis and Porte Saint-Martin. Beyond Porte Saint-Martin the\r\nboulevard was again free as far as the Bastile, with the exception of a\r\nsingle barricade, which had been begun opposite the Château d'Eau.\r\nBetween Porte Saint-Denis and Porte Saint-Martin, seven or eight\r\nredoubts crossed the street at intervals. A square of four barricades\r\nshut in Porte Saint-Denis. Of these four barricades, that one which\r\nlooked towards the Madeleine, and which was destined to receive the\r\nfirst impact of the troops, had been constructed at the culminating\r\npoint of the boulevard, with its left resting on the corners of Rue de\r\nla Lune, and its right on Rue Mazagran. Four omnibuses, five\r\nfurniture-moving vans, the office of the inspector of hackney coaches,\r\nwhich had been thrown down, the vespasian columns, which had been\r\nbroken up, the public seats on the boulevards, the flag-stones of the\r\nsteps on Rue de la Lune, the entire iron railing of the sidewalk, which\r\nhad been wrenched from its place at a single effort by the powerful\r\nhand of the crowd--such was the composition of this fortification,\r\nwhich was hardly sufficient to block the boulevard, which, at this\r\npoint, is very broad. There were no paving-stones, as the roadway is\r\nmacadamized. The barricade did not even extend from one side of the\r\nboulevard to the other, but left a large open space on the side toward\r\nRue Mazagran, where there was a house in course of erection. Observing\r\nthis gap, a well-dressed young man got upon the scaffolding, and, quite\r\nunaided, without the least hurry, without even taking the cigar from\r\nhis mouth, cut all the ropes of the scaffolding. The people at the\r\nneighbouring windows laughed and applauded him. An instant afterwards\r\nthe scaffolding fell all at once, and with a loud noise; this completed\r\nthe barricade.\r\n\r\n\"While this redoubt was being completed, a score or more of men entered\r\nthe Gymnase Theatre by the stage-door, and came out a few seconds later\r\nwith some muskets and a drum which they had found in the wardrobe, and\r\nwhich were a part of what, in theatrical language, are termed 'the\r\nproperties,' One of the men took the drum and began beating to arms.\r\nThe others, with the overturned vespasian columns, carriages thrown\r\non their sides, blinds and shutters torn from their hinges, and old\r\nscenery, constructed, opposite the guard-house of Boulevard\r\nBonne-Nouvelle, a small barricade as a sort of advanced post, or rather\r\na lunette, which commanded Boulevards Poissonnière and Montmartre as\r\nwell as Rue Hauteville. The troops had evacuated the guard-house in the\r\nmorning. They took the flag belonging to it and planted it on the\r\nbarricade. It was this same flag which was afterwards declared by the\r\nnewspapers of the _coup d'état_ to have been a 'red flag.'\r\n\r\n\"Some fifteen men took up their position at this advanced post. They\r\nhad muskets, but no cartridges, or, at most, very few. Behind them, the\r\nlarge barricade, which covered Porte Saint-Denis, was held by about a\r\nhundred combatants, in the midst of whom were observed two women and an\r\nold man with white hair, supporting himself on a cane with his left\r\nhand, and, in his right, holding a musket. One of the two women wore a\r\nsabre suspended over her shoulder; while helping to tear up the railing\r\nof the sidewalk, she had cut three fingers of her right hand with the\r\nsharp edge of an iron bar. She showed the wound to the crowd, crying:\r\n'_Vive la République!_' The other woman had ascended to the top of\r\nthe barricade, where, leaning on the flag-staff, and escorted by two\r\nmen in blouses, who were armed with muskets and presented arms, she\r\nread aloud the call to arms issued by the Representatives of the Left.\r\nThe crowd clapped their hands.\r\n\r\n\"All this occurred between noon and one o'clock. On this side of the\r\nbarricades an immense number of people covered the pavement on both\r\nsides of the boulevard; in some places, silent; in others, crying:\r\n'Down with Soulouque! Down with the traitor!'\r\n\r\n\"From time to time, mournful processions traversed the multitude; they\r\nconsisted of files of closed litters borne by hospital attendants and\r\nsoldiers. At their head marched men holding long poles, from which hung\r\nblue placards, on which was inscribed, in huge letters: _Service of\r\nthe Military Hospitals_. On the curtains of the litters: _Wounded,\r\nAmbulance_. The weather was dull and rainy.\r\n\r\n\"At this time there was a great crowd at the Bourse. On all the walls\r\nbill-stickers were posting despatches announcing the adhesion of the\r\ndepartments to the _coup d'état_. Even the stockbrokers, while\r\ntrying to bull the market, laughed and shrugged their shoulders at\r\nthese placards. Suddenly, a well-known speculator, who had for two days\r\nbeen a great admirer of the _coup d'état_, made his appearance,\r\npale and breathless, like a fugitive, and exclaimed: 'They are firing\r\non the boulevards!'\r\n\r\n\"This is what had happened:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A little after one o'clock, a quarter of an hour after the last order\r\ngiven by Louis Bonaparte to General Roguet, the boulevards throughout\r\ntheir whole length, from the Madeleine, were suddenly covered with\r\ncavalry and infantry. Almost the whole of Carrelet's division, composed\r\nof the five brigades of Cotte, Bourgon, Canrobert, Dulac, and Reibell,\r\nmaking a total of sixteen thousand four hundred and ten men, had taken\r\nup their position, and extended in echelon from Rue de la Paix to\r\nFaubourg Poissonnière. Each brigade had its battery with it. Eleven\r\npieces were counted on Boulevard Poisonnière alone. Two of the guns,\r\nwith their muzzles turned different ways, were levelled at the entrance\r\nto Rue Montmartre and Faubourg Montmartre respectively; no one knew\r\nwhy, as neither the street nor the faubourg presented even the\r\nappearance of a barricade. The spectators, who crowded the sidewalks\r\nand the windows, gazed in dismay at all these guns, sabres, and\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n\"'The troops were laughing and chatting,' says one witness. Another\r\nwitness says: 'The soldiers acted strangely. Most of them were leaning\r\non their muskets, with the butt-end on the ground, and seemed nearly\r\nfalling from fatigue, or something else.' One of those old officers who\r\nare accustomed to read a soldier's thoughts in his eyes, General L----,\r\nsaid, as he passed Café Frascati: 'They are drunk.'\r\n\r\n\"There were now some indications of what was about to happen.\r\n\r\n\"At one moment, when the crowd was crying to the troops, '_Vive la\r\nRépublique!_' 'Down with Louis Bonaparte!' one of the officers was\r\nheard to say, in a low voice: 'There's going to be some pigsticking!'\r\n\r\n\"A battalion of infantry debouches from Rue Richelieu. Before the Café\r\nCardinal it is greeted by a unanimous cry of '_Vive la République!_'\r\nA writer, the editor of a Conservative paper, who happens to be on the\r\nspot, adds: '_Down with Soulouque!_' The staff officer in command of\r\nthe detachment aims a blow at him with his sabre, which, being dodged\r\nby the journalist, cuts in two one of the small trees on the boulevard.\r\n\r\n\"As the 1st Regiment of Lancers, commanded by Colonel Rochefort,\r\nreached a point abreast of Rue Taitbout, a numerous crowd covered\r\nthe pavement of the boulevard. They were residents of the quarter,\r\ntradesmen, artists, journalists, and among them several young mothers\r\nleading their children by the hand. As the regiment was passing, men\r\nand women--every one--cried: '_Vive la Constitution!_' _'Vive la\r\nLoi!_' '_Vive la République!_' Colonel Rochefort,--the same who\r\nhad presided at the banquet given on the 31st of October, 1851, at the\r\nÊcole Militaire, by the 1st Regiment of Lancers to the 7th Regiment of\r\nLancers, and who, at this banquet, had proposed as a toast, 'Prince\r\nLouis-Napoleon, the head of the State, the personification of that\r\norder of which we are the defenders!'--this colonel, when the crowd\r\nuttered the above perfectly lawful cry, spurred his horse into the\r\nmidst of them through the chairs on the sidewalk, while the Lancers\r\nprecipitated themselves after him, and men, women, and children were\r\nindiscriminately cut down. 'A great number remained dead on the spot,'\r\nsays a defender of the _coup d'état_; and adds, 'It was done in a\r\nmoment.'[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] Captain Mauduit, _Révolution Militaire du 2 Décembre_,\r\n      p. 217.\r\n\r\n\"About two o'clock, two howitzers were pointed at the extremity of\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière, a hundred and fifty paces from the little\r\nadvanced barricade at the Bonne Nouvelle guard-house. While placing the\r\nguns in position, two of the artillerymen, who are not often guilty of\r\na false manoevre, broke the pole of a caisson. '_Don't you see they\r\nare drunk!_' exclaimed a man of the lower classes.\r\n\r\n\"At half past two, for it is necessary to follow the progress of this\r\nhideous drama minute by minute, and step by step, fire was opened\r\nbefore the barricade languidly, and almost as if done for amusement.\r\nThe officers appeared to be thinking of anything but a fight. We shall\r\nsoon see, however, of what they were thinking.\r\n\r\n\"The first cannon-ball, badly aimed, passed above all the barricades\r\nand killed a little boy at the Château d'Eau as he was drawing water\r\nfrom the fountain.\r\n\r\n\"The shops were shut, as were also almost all the windows. There was,\r\nhowever, one window left open in an upper story of the house at the\r\ncorner of Rue du Sentier. The curious spectators continued to assemble\r\nmainly on the southern side of the street. It was an ordinary crowd and\r\nnothing more,--men, women, children, and old people who looked upon the\r\nlanguid attack and defence of the barricade as a sort of sham fight.\r\n\r\n\"This barricade served as a spectacle pending the moment when it should\r\nbecome a pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers had been firing, and the defenders of the barricade\r\nreturning their fire, for about a quarter of an hour, without any one\r\nbeing wounded on either side, when suddenly, as if by an electric\r\nshock, an extraordinary and threatening movement took place, first in\r\nthe infantry, then in the cavalry. The troops suddenly faced about.\r\n\r\n\"The historiographers of the _coup d'état_ have asserted that a\r\nshot, directed against the soldiers, was fired from the window which\r\nhad remained open at the corner of Rue du Sentier. Others say that\r\nit was fired from the roof of the house at the corner of Rue\r\nNotre-Dame-de-Recouvrance and Rue Poissonnière. According to others, it\r\nwas a pistol shot and was fired from the roof of the tall house at the\r\ncorner of Rue Mazagran. The shot is contested, but what cannot be\r\ncontested is that, for having fired this problematical shot, which was\r\nperhaps nothing more than the slamming of a door, a dentist, who lived\r\nin the next house, was shot. The question resolves itself into this:\r\nDid any one hear a pistol or musket shot fired from one of the houses\r\non the boulevard? Is this the fact, or is it not? a host of witnesses\r\ndeny it.\r\n\r\n\"If the shot was really fired, there still remains a question: Was it a\r\ncause, or was it a signal?\r\n\r\n\"However this may be, all of a sudden, as we have said before, cavalry,\r\ninfantry, and artillery faced towards the dense crowd upon the\r\nsidewalks, and, no one being able to guess why, unexpectedly, without\r\nmotive, 'without parley,' as the infamous proclamations of the morning\r\nhad announced, the butchery began, from the Gymnase Theatre to the\r\nBains Chinois, that is to say, along the whole length of the richest,\r\nthe most frequented, and the most joyous boulevard of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"The army began shooting down the people at close range.\r\n\r\n\"It was a horrible and indescribable moment: the cries, the arms raised\r\ntowards heaven, the surprise, the terror, the crowd flying in all\r\ndirections, a shower of balls falling on the pavement and bounding to\r\nthe roofs of the houses, corpses strewn along the street in a moment,\r\nyoung men falling with their cigars still in their mouths, women in\r\nvelvet gowns shot down by the long rifles, two booksellers killed on\r\ntheir own thresholds without knowing what offence they had committed,\r\nshots fired down the cellar-holes and killing any one, no matter who,\r\nthe Bazaar riddled with shells and bullets, the Hôtel Sallandrouze\r\nbombarded, the Maison d'Or raked with grape-shot, Tortoni's carried by\r\nassault, hundreds of corpses stretched upon the boulevard, and a\r\ntorrent of blood on Rue de Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\"The narrator must here again crave permission to suspend his\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\"In the presence of these nameless deeds, I who write these lines\r\ndeclare that I am the recording officer. I record the crime, I appeal\r\nthe cause. My functions extend no further. I cite Louis Bonaparte, I\r\ncite Saint-Arnaud, Maupas, Moray, Magnan, Carrelet, Canrobert, and\r\nReybell, his accomplices; I cite the executioners, the murderers, the\r\nwitnesses, the victims, the red-hot cannon, the smoking sabres, the\r\ndrunken soldiers, the mourning families, the dying, the dead, the\r\nhorror, the blood, and the tears,--I cite them all to appear at the bar\r\nof the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\"The mere narrator, whoever he might be, would never be believed. Let\r\nthe living facts, the bleeding facts, therefore, speak for themselves.\r\nLet us hear the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We shall not print the names of the witnesses, we have said why, but\r\nthe reader will easily recognize the sincere and poignant accent of\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n\"One witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'I had not taken three steps on the sidewalk, when the troops, who\r\nwere marching past, suddenly halted, faced about towards the south,\r\nlevelled their muskets, and, by an instantaneous movement, fired upon\r\nthe affrighted crowd.\r\n\r\n\"'The firing continued uninterruptedly for twenty minutes, drowned from\r\ntime to time by a cannon-shot.\r\n\r\n\"'At the first volley, I threw myself on the ground and crept along on\r\nthe pavement like a snake to the first door I found open.\r\n\r\n\"'It was a wine-shop, No. 180, next door to the Bazaar de l'Industrie.\r\nI was the last person who went in. The firing still continued.\r\n\r\n\"'In this shop there were about fifty persons, and among them five or\r\nsix women and two or three children. Three poor wretches were wounded\r\nwhen they came in; two of them died, after a quarter of an hour of\r\nhorrible agony: the third was still alive when I left the shop at four\r\no'clock; however, as I afterwards learned, he did not survive his\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\"'In order to give an idea of the crowd on whom the troops fired, I\r\ncannot do better than mention some of the persons assembled in the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\n\"'There were several women, two of whom had come into the quarter to\r\nbuy provisions for their dinners; a little lawyer's clerk, who had been\r\nsent on an errand by his master; two or three frequenters of the\r\nBourse; two or three house-holders; several workmen, in wretched\r\nblouses, or in nothing. One of the unhappy beings who had taken refuge\r\nin the shop produced a deep impression on me. He was a man of about\r\nthirty, with light hair, wearing a gray paletot. He was going with his\r\nwife to dine with his family in Faubourg Montmartre, when he was\r\nstopped on the boulevard by the passage of the column of troops. At the\r\nvery beginning, at the first discharge, both he and his wife fell down;\r\nhe rose and was dragged into the wine-shop, but he no longer had his\r\nwife on his arm, and his despair cannot be described. In spite of all\r\nwe could say, he insisted that the door should be opened so that he\r\nmight run and look for his wife amid the grape-shot that was sweeping\r\nthe street. It was all we could do to keep him with us for an hour. The\r\nnext day, I learned that his wife had been killed, and her body found\r\nin the Cité Bergère. A fortnight afterwards I was informed that the\r\npoor wretch, having threatened to apply the _lex talionis_ to M.\r\nBonaparte, had been arrested and sent to Brest, on his way to Cayenne.\r\nAlmost all the persons assembled in the wine-shop held monarchical\r\nopinions, and I saw only two, a compositor named Meunier, who had\r\nformerly worked on the _Réforme_, and a friend of his, who declared\r\nthemselves to be Republicans. About four o'clock, I left the shop.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness, one of those who fancied he heard the pistol-shot on\r\nRue de Mazagran, adds:--\r\n\r\n\"'This shot was a signal to the soldiers for a fusillade on all the\r\nhouses and their windows, the roar of which lasted at least thirty\r\nminutes. The discharge was simultaneous from Porte Saint-Denis as far\r\nas the Café du Grand Balcon. The artillery soon took part with the\r\nmusketry.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'At quarter past three, a singular movement took place. The soldiers\r\nwho were facing Porte Saint-Denis, suddenly faced about, resting on the\r\nhouses from the Gymnase, the Maison du Pont-de-Fer, and the Hôtel\r\nSaint-Phar, and immediately, a running fire was directed on the people\r\non the opposite side of the way, from Rue Saint-Denis to Rue Richelieu.\r\nA few minutes were sufficient to cover the pavement with dead bodies;\r\nthe houses were riddled with balls, and this paroxysm of fury on the\r\npart of the troops continued for three quarters of an hour.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'The first cannon-shots aimed at the barricade Bonne-Nouvelle served\r\nas a signal to the rest of the troops, who fired almost simultaneously\r\nat every one within range of their muskets.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'No words are powerful enough to describe such an act of barbarity.\r\nOne must himself have seen in order to be bold enough to speak of it,\r\nand to attest the truth of so unspeakable a deed.'\r\n\r\n\"'The soldiers fired thousands and thousands of shots--the number is\r\ninappreciable[1]--on the unoffending crowd, and that without any sort\r\nof necessity. There was a desire to produce a deep impression. That was\r\nall.'\r\n\r\n      [1] The witness means _incalculable_, but we have preferred\r\n      to change nothing in the original depositions.\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'The troops of the line, followed by the cavalry and the artillery,\r\narrived on the boulevard at a time when the general excitement was very\r\ngreat. A musket-shot was fired from the midst of the troops, and it was\r\neasy to see that it had been fired in the air, from the smoke which\r\nrose perpendicularly. This was the signal for firing on the people and\r\ncharging them with the bayonet without warning. This is a significant\r\nfact, and proves that the military wanted the pretence of a motive for\r\nbeginning the massacre which followed.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness tells the following tale:--\r\n\r\n\"'The cannon, loaded with grape-shot, cut up all the shop-fronts from\r\nthe shop _Le Prophète_ to Rue Montmartre. From Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle\r\nthey must have fired also on the Maison Billecoq, for it was struck at\r\nthe corner of the wall on the Aubusson side, and the ball, having\r\ntraversed the wall, penetrated the interior of the house.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness, one of those who deny the shot, says:--\r\n\r\n\"'People have endeavoured to excuse this fusillade and these murders,\r\nby pretending that the troops had been fired on from the windows of\r\nsome of the houses. Not only does General Magnan's official report seem\r\nto deny this rumour, but I assert that the discharge was instantaneous\r\nfrom Porte Saint-Denis to Porte Montmartre, and that there was not,\r\npreviously to the general discharge, a single shot fired separately,\r\neither from the windows or by the soldiers, from Faubourg Saint-Denis\r\nto Boulevard des Italiens.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness, who is also one of those who did not hear the shot,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"'The troops were marching past the veranda of the Café Tortoni, where\r\nI had been about twenty minutes, when, before any report of fire-arms\r\nhad reached us, they quickened their pace; the cavalry went off at a\r\ngallop, the infantry at double-quick. All of a sudden we saw, coming\r\nfrom the direction of Boulevard Poissonnière, a sheet of fire, which\r\nspread and came on rapidly. I can vouch for the fact that, before the\r\nfusillade began, there had been no report of fire-arms, and that not a\r\nsingle shot had been fired from any of the houses between the Café\r\nFrascati and the spot where I stood. At last we saw the soldiers before\r\nus level their muskets and threaten us. We took refuge on Rue Taitbout,\r\nunder a porte-cochère. At the same moment the balls flew over our\r\nheads, and all around us. A woman was killed ten paces from me just as\r\nI ran under the porte-cochère. I can swear that, up to that time, there\r\nwas neither barricade nor insurgents; there were _hunters, and there\r\nwas game_ flying from them,--that is all.'\r\n\r\n\"This image 'hunters and game' is the one which immediately suggests\r\nitself to the mind of all those who beheld this horrible proceeding. We\r\nmeet with the same simile in the testimony of another witness:--\r\n\r\n\"'At the end of my street, and I know that the same thing was observed\r\nin the neighbouring ones as well, we saw the gendarmes mobiles with\r\ntheir muskets, and themselves in the position of _hunters waiting for\r\nthe game to rise_, that is to say, with their muskets at their\r\nshoulders, in order that they might take aim and fire more quickly.\r\n\r\n\"'In order that those persons who had fallen wounded near the doors on\r\nRue Montmartre might receive the first necessary attentions, we could\r\nsee the doors open from time to time and an arm stretched out, which\r\nhastily drew in the corpse, or dying man, whom the balls were striving\r\nto claim as their own.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness hits upon the same image:--\r\n\r\n\"'The soldiers stationed at the corners of the streets awaited the\r\npeople as they passed, _like hunters lying in wait for their game_, and\r\nas soon as they saw them in the street they fired at them _as at a\r\ntarget_. A great many persons were killed in this manner on Rue du\r\nSentier, Rue Rougemont, and on Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière.'\r\n\r\n                       *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"'\"Go on,\" said the officers to the unoffending citizens who demanded\r\ntheir protection. At these words they went their way quickly and with\r\nconfidence; but it was merely a watchword which meant _death_; for\r\nthey had gone only a few steps before they fell.'\r\n\r\n\"'At the moment the firing began on the boulevards,' says another\r\nwitness, 'a bookseller near the carpet warehouse was hastily closing\r\nhis shop, when a number of fugitives who were striving to obtain\r\nadmittance were suspected by the troops of the line, or the gendarmerie\r\nmobile, I do not know which, of having fired upon them. The soldiers\r\nbroke into the bookseller's house. The bookseller endeavoured to\r\nexplain matters; he was taken out, alone, before his own door, and his\r\nwife and daughters had only time to throw themselves between him and\r\nthe soldiers when he fell dead. His wife had her thigh traversed by a\r\nball, while his daughter was saved by the steel of her stays. I have\r\nbeen informed that his wife has since gone mad.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says:--\r\n\r\n\"'The soldiers entered the two booksellers' shops between _Le\r\nProphète_ and M. Sallandrouze's. The murders committed there have\r\nbeen proved. The two booksellers were massacred on the pavement. The\r\nother prisoners were put to death in the shops.'\r\n\r\n\"Let us conclude with three extracts which it is impossible to\r\ntranscribe without a shudder:--\r\n\r\n\"'For the first quarter of an hour of this scene of horror,' says a\r\nwitness, 'the firing, which for a moment became less sharp, caused some\r\npersons who were only wounded to suppose that they might get up. Of\r\nthose who were lying before _Le Prophète_ two rose. One of them fled by\r\nRue du Sentier, from which he was only a few yards away. He reached it\r\namid a shower of balls which carried away his cap. The other could only\r\nsucceed in raising himself on his knees, in which position, with his\r\nhands clasped, he besought the soldiers to spare his life; but he fell\r\nat once, shot dead. The next day one could see in the side of the\r\nveranda of _Le Prophète_ a spot only a few feet in extent, which more\r\nthan a hundred balls had struck.'\r\n\r\n\"'At the end of Rue Montmartre as far as the fountain, a distance of\r\nabout sixty paces, there were sixty bodies of men and women, mothers,\r\nchildren, and young girls. All these unfortunate creatures had fallen\r\nvictims of the first volley fired by the troops and the gendarmerie,\r\nwho were stationed on the opposite side of the boulevard. They all fled\r\nat the first discharge, took a few steps, then fell to rise no more.\r\nOne young man had taken refuge in a gateway, and tried to shelter\r\nhimself behind the projection of the wall towards the boulevards. After\r\nten minutes of badly aimed shots, he was hit, in spite of all his\r\nefforts to render himself as small as possible by drawing himself up to\r\nhis full height, and he too was seen to fall, to rise no more.'\r\n\r\n\"Another:--\r\n\r\n\"'The plate glass and the windows in the Maison du Pont-de-Fer were all\r\nshattered. One man, who was in the courtyard, went mad with fright. The\r\ncellars were filled with women who had sought refuge there, but in\r\nvain. The soldiers fired into the shops and the cellar windows. From\r\nTortoni's to the Gymnase Theatre similar things took place. This lasted\r\nmore than an hour.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let us confine ourselves to these extracts. Let us close this mournful\r\ninquest. We have proofs enough.\r\n\r\n\"The general execration of the deed is visible. A hundred other\r\ndepositions which we have before us repeat the same facts in almost the\r\nsame words. It is at present certain, it is proved, it is beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt, it cannot be denied, it is evident as the\r\nsunlight, that on Thursday, the 4th of December, 1851, the unoffending\r\ncitizens of Paris, the citizens who were not in any way mixed up with\r\nthe fighting, were shot down without warning, and massacred merely for\r\nthe sake of intimidation, and that it is not possible to attach any\r\nother meaning to Monsieur Bonaparte's mysterious command.\r\n\r\n\"This execution lasted until nightfall. For more than an hour, there\r\nwas, as it were, a debauch of musketry and artillery. The cannonade and\r\nthe platoon-firing crossed each other indiscriminately; at one time the\r\nsoldiers were killing one another. The battery of the 6th Regiment of\r\nArtillery, which belonged to Canrobert's brigade, was dismounted; the\r\nhorses, rearing in the midst of the balls, broke the axles, the wheels\r\nand the poles, and of the whole battery, in less than a minute there\r\nremained only one gun in commission. A whole squadron of the 1st\r\nLancers was obliged to seek refuge in a shed on Rue Saint-Fiacre.\r\nSeventy bullet-holes were counted the next day in the pennons of the\r\nlances. A sort of frenzy had seized the soldiers. At the corner of Rue\r\nRougemont, and in the midst of the smoke, one general was waving his\r\narms as if to restrain them; a medical officer of the 27th was nearly\r\nkilled by the soldiers whom he endeavoured to check. A sergeant said to\r\nan officer who took hold of his arm: 'Lieutenant, you are betraying\r\nus.' The soldiers had no consciousness of themselves; they had gone mad\r\nwith the crime they were ordered to commit. There comes a moment when\r\nthe very outrageousness of what you are doing makes you redouble your\r\nblows. Blood is a kind of horrible wine; men get drunk with carnage.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as if some invisible hand were launching death from the\r\nmidst of a cloud. The soldiers were no longer aught but projectiles.\r\n\r\n\"Two guns in the roadway of the boulevard were pointed at the front of\r\na single house, that of M. Sallandrouze, and fired volley after volley\r\nat it, at close range. This house, which is an old mansion of hewn\r\nstone, remarkable for its almost monumental flight of steps, being\r\nsplit by bullets as if by iron wedges, opened, gaped, and cracked from\r\ntop to bottom. The soldiers fired faster and faster. At every\r\ndischarge, the walls cracked again. Suddenly an officer of artillery\r\ngalloped up, and cried, 'Hold! hold!' The house was leaning forward;\r\nanother ball, and it would have fallen on the guns and the gunners.\r\n\r\n\"The artillerymen were so drunk that many of them, not knowing what\r\nthey were doing, allowed themselves to be killed by the rebound of\r\ntheir guns. The balls came simultaneously from Porte Saint-Denis,\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière and Boulevard Montmartre; the drivers, hearing\r\nthem whizzing past their ears in every direction, lay down upon their\r\nhorses, while the gunners hid underneath the caissons and behind the\r\nwagons; soldiers were seen to drop their caps and fly in dismay into\r\nRue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance; troopers, losing their heads, fired\r\ntheir carbines in the air, while others dismounted and made a\r\nbreastwork of their horses. Two or three of the latter, without riders,\r\nran here and there, mad with terror.\r\n\r\n\"The most horrible amusements were blended with the massacre. The\r\ntirailleurs from Vincennes had established themselves at one of the\r\nbarricades on the boulevard which they had carried by assault, and from\r\nthence they practised shooting at persons passing at a distance. From\r\nthe neighbouring houses, such shocking dialogues as this were heard:\r\n'I'll bet I bring that fellow down.'--'I'll bet you don't.'--'I'll bet\r\nI do.' And the shot followed. When the man fell, one could guess by the\r\nroar of laughter. Whenever a woman passed, the officers cried: 'Fire at\r\nthat woman; fire at the women!'\r\n\r\n\"This was one of the watchwords; on Boulevard Montmartre, where the\r\nbayonet was greatly in requisition, a young staff-captain cried: 'Prick\r\nthe women!'\r\n\r\n\"One woman, with a loaf under her arm, thought she might cross Rue\r\nSaint-Fiacre. A tirailleur shot her down.\r\n\r\n\"On Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau they did not go so far. A woman cried,\r\n'Vive la République!' she was merely whipped by the soldiers. But let\r\nus return to the boulevard.\r\n\r\n\"One of the passers-by, a bailiff, was struck by a ball aimed at his\r\nhead; he fell on his hands and knees, imploring mercy! He received\r\nthirteen more balls in his body. He survived: by a miraculous chance,\r\nnot one of his wounds was mortal. The ball which struck his head tore\r\nthe skin, and made the circuit of his skull without fracturing it.\r\n\r\n\"An old man of eighty, being found concealed somewhere or other, was\r\nbrought before the steps of _Le Prophète_, and shot: he fell. 'He will\r\nhave no bump on his head,' said a soldier; the old man had fallen upon\r\na heap of dead bodies. Two young men from Issy, who had been married\r\nonly a month, to two sisters, were crossing the boulevard on their way\r\nfrom business. They saw the muskets levelled at them, and threw\r\nthemselves on their knees, crying, 'We married the two sisters!' They\r\nwere killed. A dealer in cocoa, named Robert, living on Faubourg\r\nPoissonnière, No. 97, fled, with his can on his back, down Rue\r\nMontmartre; he was killed.[1] A boy of thirteen, a saddler's apprentice,\r\nwas passing along the boulevard opposite the Café Vachette. The soldiers\r\ntook aim at him. He uttered the most heart-rending cries, and, holding\r\nup a bridle that he had in his hand, waved it in the air, exclaiming,\r\n'I am sent on an errand!' He was killed. Three balls perforated his\r\nbreast. All along the boulevards were heard the shrieks and heavy falls\r\nof the wounded, whom the soldiers pierced with their bayonets, and then\r\nleft, without taking the trouble to despatch them.\r\n\r\n      [1] \"We may name the witness who saw this. He is one of the\r\n      proscribed; it is M. Versigny, a representative of the people.\r\n      He says:--\r\n\r\n      \"'I can still see, opposite Rue du Croissant, an unfortunate\r\n      itinerant vender of cocoa, with his tin can on his back, stagger,\r\n      then gradually sink in a heap, and fall dead before a shop. Armed\r\n      only with his bell, he had received all by himself the honour of\r\n      being fired at by a whole platoon.'\r\n\r\n      \"The same witness adds:--'The soldiers swept the streets with\r\n      their guns, even where there was not a paving-stone moved from\r\n      its place, not a single combatant.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Some villains seized the opportunity to steal. The treasurer of a\r\ncompany, whose offices are on Rue de la Banque, left at two o'clock to\r\ncollect a note on Rue Bergère, returned with the money, and was killed\r\non the boulevard. When his body was removed, he had neither ring, nor\r\nwatch, nor the money he was taking to his office.\r\n\r\n\"On the pretence that shots had been fired at the troops, the latter\r\nentered ten or twelve houses, at random, and despatched with their\r\nbayonets every one they found. In all the houses on the boulevard,\r\nthere are metal pipes by which the dirty water runs out into the\r\ngutter. The soldiers, with no idea why it was so, conceived a feeling\r\nof mistrust or hatred for such and such a house, closed from top to\r\nbottom, mute and gloomy, and like all the houses on the boulevard,\r\nseeming uninhabited, so silent was it. They knocked at the door; the\r\ndoor opened, and they entered. An instant after there was seen to flow\r\nfrom the mouth of the metal pipes a red, smoking stream. It was blood.\r\n\r\n\"A captain, with his eyes starting from their sockets, cried to the\r\nsoldiers: 'No quarter!' A major vociferated: 'Enter the houses and kill\r\nevery one!'\r\n\r\n\"Sergeants were heard to say: '_Pitch into the Bedouins; hit them\r\nhard!_' 'In the uncle's time,' says a witness, 'the soldiers used to\r\ncall the civilians _pékins_. At present, we are Bedouins; the soldiers\r\nmassacred the people to the cry of \"_Give it to the Bedouins_.\"'\r\n\r\n\"At the Frascati Club, where many of the regular frequenters of the\r\nplace were assembled, among them an old general, they heard the thunder\r\nof musketry and artillery, and could not believe that the troops were\r\nfiring ball. They laughed, and said to one another: 'It's blank\r\ncartridges. What a _mise-en-scène_! What an actor this Bonaparte is!'\r\nThey thought they were at the Circus. Suddenly the soldiers entered,\r\nmad with rage, and were about to shoot every one. They had no idea of\r\nthe danger they were running. They continued to laugh. One of the\r\neye-witnesses said to us: '_We thought that this was part of the\r\nbuffoonery._' However, seeing that the soldiers continued to threaten\r\nthem, they at last understood.--'_Kill them all!_' cried the soldiers.\r\nA lieutenant, who recognized the old general, prevented them from\r\ncarrying out their threat. In spite of this, a sergeant said: 'Hold\r\nyour d----d tongue, lieutenant; this isn't your affair, it's ours.'\r\n\r\n\"The troops killed for the mere sake of killing. A witness says: 'In\r\nthe courtyards of the houses, they shot even the horses and dogs.'\r\n\r\n\"In the house next Frascati's, at the corner of Rue Richelieu, the\r\nsoldiers were coolly going to shoot even the women and children, who\r\nwere already drawn up in a mass before a platoon for that purpose when\r\na colonel arrived. He stopped the massacre, boxed up these poor\r\ntrembling creatures in the Passages des Panoramas, where he locked them\r\nin, and saved them. A celebrated writer, Monsieur Lireux, after having\r\nescaped the first balls, was led about, during an hour, from one\r\nguard-house to another, preparatory to being shot. It required a\r\nmiracle to save him. The celebrated artist, Sax, who happened to be in\r\nthe musical establishment of M. Brandus, was about to be shot, when a\r\ngeneral recognized him. Everywhere else the people were killed\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\n\"The first person killed in this butchery--history has in like manner\r\npreserved the name of the first person killed at the massacre of Saint\r\nBartholomew--was one Théodore Debaecque, who lived in the house at the\r\ncorner of Rue du Sentier, where the carnage began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the slaughter came to an end,--that is to say when it was black\r\nnight, and it had begun in broad day,--the dead bodies were not\r\nremoved; they were so numerous that thirty-three of them were counted\r\nbefore a single shop, that of M. Barbedienne. Every square of ground\r\nleft open in the asphalt at the foot of the trees on the boulevards was\r\na reservoir of blood. 'The dead bodies,' says a witness, 'were piled up\r\nin heaps, one upon another, old men, children, blouses and paletots,\r\nassembled pell-mell, in an indescribable mass of heads, arms, and\r\nlegs.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness describes thus a group of three individuals: 'Two had\r\nfallen on their backs; and the third, having tripped over their legs,\r\nhad fallen upon them.' The single corpses were rare and attracted more\r\nnotice than the others. One young man, well dressed, was seated against\r\na wall, with his legs apart, his arms half folded, one of Verdier's\r\ncanes in his hand, and seemed to be looking at what was going on around\r\nhim; he was dead. A little farther on, the bullets had nailed against a\r\nshop a youth in velveteen trousers who had some proof-sheets in his\r\nhand. The wind fluttered these bloody proofs, on which the fingers of\r\nthe corpse were still closed. A poor old man, with white hair, was\r\nlying in the middle of the road, with his umbrella at his side. His\r\nelbow almost touched a young man in patent leather boots and yellow\r\ngloves, who had his eye-glass still in his eye. A few steps away, with\r\nher head on the sidewalk, and her feet in the road, lay a woman of the\r\npeople, who had attempted to escape, with her child in her arms. Both\r\nwere dead; but the mother still tightly grasped her child.'\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you will tell me, M. Bonaparte, that you are very sorry, but that\r\nit was an unfortunate affair; that in presence of Paris, ready to rise,\r\nit was necessary to adopt a decided course, and that you were forced to\r\nthis extremity; that, as regards the _coup d'état_, you were in debt;\r\nthat your ministers were in debt; that your aides-de-camp were in debt;\r\nthat your footmen were in debt; that you were answerable for them all;\r\nand that, deuce take it! a man cannot be a prince without spending,\r\nfrom time to time, a few millions too much; that one must amuse one's\r\nself and enjoy life a bit; that the Assembly was to blame for not\r\nhaving understood this, and for seeking to restrict you to two paltry\r\nmillions a year, and, what is more, to force you to resign your\r\nauthority at the expiration of your four years, and to execute the\r\nConstitution; that, after all, you could not leave the Élysée to enter\r\nthe debtors' prison at Clichy; that you had in vain had recourse to\r\nthose little expedients which are provided for by Article 405; that\r\nexposure was at hand, that the demagogical press was chattering, that\r\nthe matter of the gold ingots threatened to become known, that you were\r\nbound to respect the name of Napoleon, and that, on my word! having no\r\nother alternative, rather than become one of the vulgar swindlers named\r\nin the code, you preferred to be one of the great assassins of history!\r\n\r\n\"So then, instead of polluting, this blood has purified you! Very good.\r\n\r\n\"I resume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When all was finished, Paris came to see the sight. The people flocked\r\nin crowds to those terrible places; no one interfered with them. This\r\nwas what the butcher wanted. Louis Bonaparte had not done all this to\r\nhide it afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"The southern side of the boulevard was covered with torn cartridge\r\nwads; the sidewalk on the northern side disappeared beneath the mortar\r\ntorn from the fronts of the houses by the bullets, and was as white as\r\nif snow had fallen on it; while pools of blood left large dark patches\r\non that snow of ruins. The foot of the passer-by avoided a corpse only\r\nto tread upon fragments of broken glass, plaster, or stone; some houses\r\nwere so riddled by the grape and cannon-balls, that they seemed on the\r\npoint of tumbling down; this was the case with M. Sallandrouze's, which\r\nwe have already mentioned, and the mourning warehouse at the corner of\r\nFaubourg Montmartre. 'The Billecoq house,' says a witness, 'is, at the\r\npresent moment, still propped up by wooden beams, and the front will\r\nhave to be partly rebuilt. The balls have made holes in the carpet\r\nwarehouse in several places.' Another witness says: 'All the houses\r\nfrom the Cercle des Étrangers to Rue Poissonnière were literally\r\nriddled with balls, especially on the right-hand side of the boulevard.\r\nOne of the large panes of plate glass in the warehouses of _La Petite\r\nJeannette_ received certainly more than two hundred for its share.\r\nThere was not a window that had not its ball. One breathed an\r\natmosphere of saltpetre. Thirty-seven corpses were heaped up in the\r\nCité Bergère; the passers-by could count them through the iron\r\nrailings. A woman was standing at the corner of Rue Richelieu. She was\r\nlooking on. Suddenly she felt that her feet were wet. 'Why, has it been\r\nraining?' she said, 'my feet are in the water.'--'No, madame,' replied\r\na person who was passing, 'it is not water.'--Her feet were in a pool\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\n\"On Rue Grange-Batelière three corpses were seen in a corner, quite\r\nnaked.\r\n\r\n\"During the butchery, the barricades on the boulevards had been carried\r\nby Bourgon's brigade. The corpses of those who had defended the\r\nbarricade at Porte Saint-Denis, of which we have already spoken at the\r\nbeginning of our narrative, were piled up before the door of the Maison\r\nJouvin. 'But,' says a witness, 'they were nothing compared to the heaps\r\nwhich covered the boulevard.'\r\n\r\n\"About two paces from the Théâtre des Variétés, the crowd stopped to\r\nlook at a cap full of brains and blood, hung upon a tree.\r\n\r\n\"A witness says: 'A little beyond the Variétés, I came to a corpse\r\nlying on the ground with its face downwards; I tried to raise it, aided\r\nby others, but we were repelled by the soldiers. A little farther on,\r\nthere were two bodies, a man and a woman; then one alone, a workman'\r\n(we abridge the account). 'From Rue Montmartre to Rue du Sentier _one\r\nliterally walked in blood_; at certain spots, it covered the sidewalk\r\nsome inches deep, and, without exaggeration, one was obliged to use the\r\ngreatest caution not to step into it. I counted there thirty-three\r\ncorpses. The sight was too much for me: I felt great tears rolling down\r\nmy cheeks. I asked leave to cross the road, in order to enter my own\r\nhouse, and my request was _granted as a favour_!'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness says: 'The boulevard presented a horrible sight. _We\r\nliterally walked in blood._ We counted eighteen corpses in about five\r\nand twenty paces.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness, the keeper of a wine-shop on Rue du Sentier, says: 'I\r\nwent along Boulevard du Temple to my house. When I got home, I had an\r\ninch of blood around the bottom of my trousers.'\r\n\r\n\"Representative Versigny has this to say: 'We could see, in the\r\ndistance, almost as far as Porte Saint-Denis, the immense bivouac-fires\r\nof the infantry. The light from them, with the exception of that from a\r\nfew rare lamps, was all we had to guide us amid that horrible carnage.\r\nThe fighting in the daytime was nothing compared to those corpses and\r\nthat silence. R. and I were half-dead with horror. A man was passing\r\nus; hearing one of my exclamations, he came up to me, took my hand, and\r\nsaid: \"You are a republican; and I was what is called a friend of\r\norder, a reactionary, but one must be forsaken of God, not to execrate\r\nthis horrible orgy. France is dishonoured.\" And he left us, sobbing.'\r\n\r\n\"Another witness, who allows us to give his name, a Legitimist, the\r\nhonourable Monsieur de Cherville, deposes as follows: 'In the evening,\r\nI determined on continuing my sad inspection. On Rue Le Peletier I met\r\nMessieurs Bouillon and Gervais (of Caen). We walked a few steps\r\ntogether, when my foot slipped. I clung to M. Bouillon. I looked at my\r\nfeet. I had walked into a large pool of blood. M. Bouillon then\r\ninformed me, that, being at his window, in the morning, he saw a\r\ndruggist, whose shop he pointed out to me, shutting his door. A woman\r\nfell; the druggist rushed forward to raise her; at the same moment, a\r\nsoldier, ten paces off, aimed at him and lodged a bullet in his head.\r\nOvercome with wrath, and forgetting his own danger, M. Bouillon\r\nexclaimed to the passers-by: \"You will all bear witness to what has\r\ntaken place.\"'\r\n\r\n\"About eleven o'clock at night, when the fires of the bivouacs were\r\neverywhere lighted, M. Bonaparte allowed the troops to amuse\r\nthemselves. It was like a _fête-de-nuit_ on the boulevards. The\r\nsoldiers laughed and sang, as they threw into the fire the débris of\r\nthe barricades. After this, as at Strasbourg and Boulogne, money was\r\ndistributed among them. Let us hear what a witness says: 'I saw, at\r\nPorte Saint-Denis, a staff-officer give two hundred francs to the chief\r\nof a detachment of twenty men, with these words: \"The prince ordered me\r\nto give you this money, to be distributed among your brave soldiers!\r\nthe marks of his satisfaction will not be confined to this.\"--Each\r\nsoldier received ten francs.'\r\n\r\n\"On the evening of the battle of Austerlitz, the Emperor said:\r\n'Soldiers, I am content with you.'\r\n\r\n\"Another person adds: 'The soldiers, with cigars in their mouths,\r\ntwitted the passers-by and jingled the money in their pockets.' Another\r\nsays: 'The officers broke the rolls of louis d'or _like sticks of\r\nchocolate_.'\r\n\r\n\"The sentinels allowed only women to pass; whenever a man made his\r\nappearance, they cried: 'Be off!' Tables were spread in the bivouacs,\r\nand officers and soldiers drank around them. The flame of the braziers\r\nwas reflected on all those merry faces. The corks and capsules of the\r\nchampagne bottles floated on the red torrents of blood. From bivouac to\r\nbivouac the soldiers exchanged loud cries and obscene jokes. They\r\nsaluted one another with: 'Long live the grenadiers!' 'Long live the\r\nlancers!' and all joined in, 'Long live Louis-Napoleon!' One heard the\r\nclinking of glasses, and the crash of broken bottles. Here and there,\r\nin the shadow, women, with a taper of yellow wax or a lantern in their\r\nhands, prowled among the dead bodies, gazing at those pale faces, one\r\nafter another, and seeking a son, a father, or a husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let us hasten to have done with these ghastly details.\r\n\r\n\"The next day, the fifth, something terrible was seen in the cemetery\r\nof Montmartre.\r\n\r\n\"An immense space, the exact location of which is unknown to this day,\r\nwas 'utilized' for the temporary interment of some of those who had\r\nbeen massacred. They were buried with their heads above ground, in\r\norder that their relations might recognize them. Most of them had also\r\ntheir feet above ground, with a little earth upon their breasts. The\r\ncrowd flocked to the spot, the sightseers pushed one here and there,\r\nthey wandered about among the graves, and, at times, one felt the earth\r\ngiving way beneath one's feet: one was walking on the stomach of a\r\ncorpse. One turned and beheld a pair of boots, of sabots, or of women's\r\nshoes; while on the other side was the head, which the pressure on the\r\nbody caused to move.\r\n\r\n\"An illustrious witness, the great sculptor David, who is now\r\nproscribed and wandering far from France, says:--\r\n\r\n\"'In the cemetery of Montmartre, I saw about forty bodies with their\r\nclothes still on them; they had been placed side by side and a few\r\nshovelfuls of earth hid all except their heads, which had been left\r\nuncovered in order that they might be recognized by their relations.\r\nThere was so little earth that their feet were still visible; the\r\ncrowd, horrible to say, was walking on their bodies. Among them were\r\nyoung men with noble features, bearing the stamp of courage; in the\r\nmidst was a poor woman, a baker's servant, who had been killed while\r\nshe was carrying bread to her master's customers, and near her a young\r\ngirl who sold flowers on the boulevards. Those persons who were looking\r\nfor friends who had disappeared, were obliged to trample the bodies\r\nunder foot, in order to obtain a near view of their faces. I heard a\r\nman of the lower classes say, with an expression of horror: \"It is like\r\nwalking upon a spring-board.\"'\r\n\r\n\"The crowd continued to flock to the various spots where the victims\r\nhad been carried, especially to the Cité Bergère, so that, on this day,\r\nthe fifth, as the numbers increased to such an extent as to become\r\ntroublesome, and as it was necessary to get rid of them, these words,\r\nwritten in capital letters on a large placard, were to be seen at the\r\nentrance of the Cité Bergère: 'There are no more dead bodies here.'\r\n\r\n\"The three naked corpses on Rue Grange-Batelière were not removed until\r\nthe evening of the fifth.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident, and we insist upon it, that at first, and for the\r\nadvantage which it wished to derive from it, the _coup d'état_ did\r\nnot make the least endeavour to conceal its crime; shame did not come\r\nuntil later; the first day, on the contrary, it flaunted it. It was not\r\ncontent with atrocity, it must needs add cynicism. Massacre was but a\r\nmeans; the end was intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Was this end attained?\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately afterwards, as early as the evening of December 4, the\r\npublic excitement subsided. Paris was frozen with stupor. The\r\nindignation that raised its voice before the _coup d'état_, held\r\nits peace before the carnage. The affair had ceased to resemble\r\nanything in history. One felt that one had to deal with a man of a\r\nhitherto unknown type.\r\n\r\n\"Crassus crushed the gladiators; Herod slaughtered the infants; Charles\r\nIX exterminated the Huguenots; Peter of Russia, the Strelitz; Mehemet\r\nAli, the Mamelukes; Mahmoud, the Janissaries; while Danton massacred\r\nthe prisoners. Louis Bonaparte had just discovered a new sort of\r\nmassacre--the massacre of the passers-by.\r\n\r\n\"This massacre ended the struggle. There are times when what should\r\nexasperate a people, strikes them with terror. The population of Paris\r\nfelt that a ruffian had his foot upon his throat. It no longer offered\r\nany resistance. That same evening Mathieu (of the Drôme) entered the\r\nplace where the Committee of Resistance was sitting and said to us: 'We\r\nare no longer in Paris, we are no longer under the Republic; we are at\r\nNaples under the sway of King Bomba.'\r\n\r\n\"From that moment, in spite of all the efforts of the committee, of the\r\nrepresentatives, and of their courageous allies, there was, save at\r\ncertain points only,--such as the barricade of the Petit-Carreau, for\r\ninstance, where Denis Dussoubs, the brother of the representative, fell\r\nso heroically,--naught but a resistance which resembled the last\r\nconvulsions of despair rather than a combat. All was finished.\r\n\r\n\"The next day, the 5th, the victorious troops paraded on the\r\nboulevards. A general was seen to show his naked sword to the people,\r\nand to exclaim: 'The Republic--here it is!'\r\n\r\n\"Thus an infamous butchery, the massacre of the passers-by, was\r\nincluded, as a supreme necessity, in the 'measure' of the 2nd of\r\nDecember. To undertake it, a man must be a traitor; to make it\r\nsuccessful, he must be an assassin.\r\n\r\n\"It was by this proceeding that the _coup d'état_ conquered France\r\nand overcame Paris. Yes, Paris! It is necessary for one to repeat it\r\nagain and again to himself,--it was at Paris that all this happened!\r\n\r\n\"Great God! The Russians entered Paris brandishing their lances and\r\nsinging their wild songs, but Moscow had been burnt; the Prussians\r\nentered Paris, but Berlin had been taken; the Austrians entered Paris,\r\nbut Vienna had been bombarded; the English entered Paris, but the camp\r\nat Boulogne had menaced London; they came to our barriers, these men of\r\nall nations, with drums beating, trumpets resounding, colours flying,\r\nswords drawn, cannon rumbling, matches lighted, drunk with excitement,\r\nenemies, conquerors, instruments of vengeance, shrieking with rage\r\nbefore the domes of Paris the names of their capitals,--London, Berlin,\r\nVienna, Moscow! The moment, however, that they crossed the threshold of\r\nthe city, the moment that the hoofs of their horses rang upon the\r\npavement of our streets, Englishmen, Austrians, Prussians, Russians, on\r\nentering Paris, beheld in its walls, its buildings, its people,\r\nsomething predestined, something venerable and august; they all felt a\r\nholy sentiment of respect for the sacred city; they all felt that they\r\nhad before them, not the city of one people, but the city of the whole\r\nhuman race; they all lowered the swords they had raised! Yes, to\r\nmassacre the Parisians, to treat Paris like a place taken by assault,\r\nto deliver up to pillage one quarter of the town, to outrage the second\r\nEternal City, to assassinate civilization in her very sanctuary, to\r\nshoot down old men, children, and women, in this illustrious spot, this\r\nhome of the world; that which Wellington forbade his half-naked\r\nHighlanders, and Schwartzenberg his Croats to do; that which Blucher\r\ndid not suffer his Landwehr to do, and which Platow dared not allow his\r\nCossacks to undertake,--all these things hast thou, base wretch, caused\r\nto be done by French soldiers!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER CRIMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSINISTER QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the number of the dead?\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte, conscious of the advent of history, and imagining that\r\na Charles IX can extenuate a Saint Bartholomew, has published as a\r\n_pièce justificative_, a so-called \"official list of the deceased\r\npersons.\" In this \"Alphabetical List,\"[1] you will meet with such items\r\nas these: \"Adde, bookseller, 17 Boulevard Poissonnière, killed in his\r\nhouse; Boursier, a child seven years and a-half old, killed on Rue\r\nTiquetonne; Belval, cabinetmaker, 10 Rue de la Lune, killed in his\r\nhouse; Coquard, house-holder at Vire (Calvados), killed on Boulevard\r\nMontmartre; Debaecque, tradesman, 45 Rue de Sentier, killed in his\r\nhouse; De Couvercelle, florist, 257 Rue Saint-Denis, killed in his\r\nhouse; Labilte, jeweller, 63 Boulevard Saint-Martin, killed in his\r\nhouse; Monpelas, perfumer, 181 Rue Saint-Martin, killed in his house;\r\nDemoiselle Grellier, housekeeper, 209 Faubourg Saint-Martin, killed on\r\nBoulevard Montmartre; Femme Guillard, cashier, 77 Faubourg Saint-Denis,\r\nkilled on Boulevard Saint-Denis; Femme Garnier, confidential servant, 6\r\nBoulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, killed on Boulevard Saint-Denis; Femme\r\nLedaust, housekeeper, 76 Passage du Caire, at the Morgue; Françoise\r\nNoël, waistcoat-maker, 20 Rue des Fossés-Montmartre, died at La\r\nCharité; Count Poninski, annuitant, 32 Rue de la Paix, killed on\r\nBoulevard Montmartre; Femme Raboisson, dressmaker, died at the National\r\nHospital; Femme Vidal, 97 Rue de Temple, died at the Hôtel-Dieu; Femme\r\nSéguin, embroideress, 240 Rue Saint-Martin, died at the hospital\r\nBeaujon; Demoiselle Seniac, shop-woman, 196 Rue du Temple, died at the\r\nhospital Beaujon; Thirion de Montauban, house-holder, 10 Rue de Lancry,\r\nkilled at his own door,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n      [1] The functionary who drew up this list, is, we know, a learned\r\n      and accurate statistician; he prepared this statement honestly,\r\n      we have no doubt. He has stated what was shown to him, and what\r\n      he was permitted to see, but what was concealed from him was\r\n      beyond his reach. The field for conjecture is left open.\r\n\r\nTo abridge: Louis Bonaparte confesses, in this state paper, _one\r\nhundred and ninety-one_ murders.\r\n\r\nThis document being cited for what it is worth, the question is, what\r\nis the true total? What is the exact figure of his victims? How many\r\ncorpses bestrew the _coup d'état_ of December? Who can tell? Who\r\nknows? Who will ever know? As we have already seen, one witness\r\ndeposed: \"I counted in that place thirty-three bodies;\" another, at a\r\ndifferent part of the boulevard, said: \"We counted eighteen bodies\r\nwithin a space of twenty or twenty-five yards.\" A third person,\r\nspeaking of another spot, said: \"There were upwards of sixty bodies\r\nwithin a distance of sixty yards.\" The writer so long threatened with\r\ndeath told ourselves: \"I saw with my eyes upwards of eight hundred dead\r\nbodies lying along the boulevard.\"\r\n\r\nNow think, compute how many it requires of battered brains, of breasts\r\nshattered by grape-shot, to cover with blood, \"literally,\" half a mile\r\nof boulevards. Go you, as did the wives, the sisters, the daughters,\r\nthe wailing mothers, take a torch, plunge into the dark night, feel on\r\nthe ground, feel along the pavement and the walls, pick up the corpses,\r\ninterrogate the phantoms, and reckon if you can.\r\n\r\nThe number of his victims! One is reduced to conjecture. This question\r\nmust be solved by history. As for us, it is a question which we pledge\r\nourselves to examine and explore hereafter.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, Louis Bonaparte made a display of his slaughter. We\r\nhave told the reason why. It suited his purpose. After that, having\r\nderived from the deed all the required advantage, he concealed it.\r\nOrders were given to the Élyséan journals to be silent, to Magnan to\r\nomit, to the historiographers to know nothing. They buried the slain\r\nafter midnight, without lights, without processions, without prayers,\r\nwithout priests, by stealth. Families were enjoined not to weep too\r\nloud.\r\n\r\nThe massacre along the boulevards was only a part; it was followed by\r\nthe summary fusillades, the secret executions.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses whom we have questioned asked a major in the\r\ngendarmerie mobile, who had distinguished himself in these butcheries:\r\n\"Come, tell us the figure? Was it four hundred?\" The man shrugged his\r\nshoulders. \"Was it six hundred?\" The man shook his head. \"Eight\r\nhundred?\"--\"Say twelve hundred,\" said the officer, \"and you will fall\r\nshort.\"\r\n\r\nAt this present hour nobody knows exactly what the 2nd of December was,\r\nwhat it did, what it dared, whom it killed, whom it buried. The very\r\nmorning of the crime, the newspaper offices were placed under seal,\r\nfree speech was suppressed, by Louis Bonaparte, that man of silence and\r\ndarkness. On the 2nd, the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th, and ever since, Truth\r\nhas been taken by the throat and strangled just as she was about to\r\nspeak. She could not even utter a cry. He has deepened the gloom about\r\nhis ambuscade and he has succeeded in part. Let history strive as she\r\nmay, the 2nd of December will, perhaps, continue involved, for a long\r\ntime to come, in a sort of ghastly twilight. It is a crime made up of\r\naudacity and darkness; here it shows itself impudently in broad\r\ndaylight; there it skulks away into the mist. Hideous and double-faced\r\neffrontery, which conceals no one knows what monstrosities beneath its\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nBut these glimpses are sufficient. There is a certain side of the 2nd\r\nof December where all is dark; but, within that darkness, graves are\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nBeneath this great enormity a host of crimes may be vaguely\r\ndistinguished. Such is the behest of Providence; there are compulsions\r\nlinked to treason. You are a perjurer! You violate your oaths! You\r\ntrample upon law and justice! Well! take a rope, for you will be\r\ncompelled to strangle; take a dagger, for you will be compelled to\r\nstab; take a club, for you will be compelled to strike; take shadow and\r\ndarkness, for you will be compelled to hide yourself. One crime brings\r\non another; there is a logical consistency in horror. There is no\r\nhalting, no middle course. Go on! do this first; good! Now do that,\r\nthen this again; and so for ever! The law is like the veil of the\r\nTemple: once rent, it is rent from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nYes, we say it again, in what has been called \"the act of the 2nd of\r\nDecember,\" one meets with crime at every depth. Perjury floats on the\r\nsurface, murder lies at the bottom. Partial homicides, wholesale\r\nbutcheries, shooting in open day, fusillades by night; a steam of blood\r\nrises from every part of the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nSearch in the common grave of the churchyards, search beneath the\r\nstreet pavement, beneath the sloping banks of the Champ-de-Mars,\r\nbeneath the trees of the public gardens, in the bed of the Seine!\r\n\r\nBut few revelations. That is easily understood. Bonaparte has the\r\nsatanic art of binding to himself a crowd of miserable officials by I\r\nknow not what terrible universal complicity. The stamped papers of the\r\nmagistrates, the desks of the registrars, the cartridge-boxes of the\r\nsoldiers, the prayers of the priests, are his accomplices. He has cast\r\nhis crime about him like a network, and prefects, mayors, judges,\r\nofficers, and soldiers are caught therein. Complicity descends from\r\nthe general to the corporal, and ascends from the corporal to the\r\npresident. The _sergent-de-ville_ and the minister feel that they are\r\nequally implicated. The gendarme whose pistol has pressed against the\r\near of some unfortunate, and whose uniform has been splashed with human\r\nbrains, feels as guilty as his colonel. Above, cruel men gave orders\r\nwhich savage men executed below. Savagery keeps the secret of cruelty.\r\nHence this hideous silence.\r\n\r\nThere is even emulation and rivalry between this savagery and this\r\natrocity; what escaped the one was seized upon by the other. The future\r\nwill refuse to credit these prodigious excesses. A workman was crossing\r\nthe Pont au Change, some gendarmes mobiles stopped him; they smelt his\r\nhands. \"He smells of powder,\" said a gendarme. They shot the workman;\r\nhis body was pierced by four balls. \"Throw him into the stream,\" cries\r\nthe sergeant. The gendarmes take him by the neck and heels and hurl him\r\nover the bridge. Shot, and then drowned, the man floats down the river.\r\nHowever, he was not dead; the icy river revived him; but he was unable\r\nto move, his blood flowed into the water from four holes; but being\r\nheld up by his blouse, he struck against an arch of one of the bridges.\r\nThere some lightermen discovered him, picked him up, and carried him to\r\nthe hospital; he recovered; he left the place. The next day he was\r\narrested, and brought before a court-martial. Rejected by death, he was\r\nreclaimed by Louis Bonaparte. This man is now at Lambessa.\r\n\r\nWhat the Champ-de-Mars secretly witnessed,--the terrible night\r\ntragedies which dismayed and dishonoured it,--history cannot yet\r\nreveal. Thanks to Louis Bonaparte, this revered field of the Federation\r\nmay in future be called Aceldama. One of the unhappy soldiers whom the\r\nman of the 2nd of December transformed into executioners, relates with\r\nhorror, and beneath his breath, that in a single night the number of\r\npeople shot was not less than eight hundred.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte hastened to dig a grave and threw in his crime. A few\r\nshovelfuls of earth, a sprinkling of holy water by a priest, and all\r\nwas said. And now, the imperial carnival dances above that grave.\r\n\r\nIs this all? Can it be that this is the end? Does God allow and\r\nacquiesce in such burials? Believe it not. Some day, beneath the feet\r\nof Bonaparte, between the marble pavements of the Élysée or the\r\nTuileries, this grave will suddenly re-open, and those bodies will come\r\nforth, one after another, each with its wound, the young man stricken\r\nto the heart, the old man shaking his aged head pierced by a ball, the\r\nmother put to the sword, with her infant killed in her arms,--all of\r\nthem upstanding, pallid, terrible to see, and with bleeding eyes fixed\r\non their assassin.\r\n\r\nAwaiting that day, and even now, history has begun to try you, Louis\r\nBonaparte. History rejects your official list of the dead, and your\r\n_pièces justificatives_.\r\n\r\nHistory asserts that they lie, and that you lie.\r\n\r\nYou have tied a bandage over the eyes of France and put a gag in her\r\nmouth. Wherefore?\r\n\r\nWas it to do righteous deeds? No, but crimes. The evil-doer is afraid\r\nof the light.\r\n\r\nYou shot people by night, on the Champ-de-Mars, at the Prefecture, at\r\nthe Palais de Justice, on the squares, on the quays, everywhere.\r\n\r\nYou say you did not.\r\n\r\nI say you did.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with you we have a right to surmise, to suspect, and to\r\naccuse.\r\n\r\nWhat you deny, we have a right to believe; your denial is equivalent to\r\naffirmation.\r\n\r\nYour 2nd of December is pointed at by the public conscience. Nobody\r\nthinks of it without inwardly shuddering. What did you do in those dark\r\nhours?\r\n\r\nYour days are ghastly, your nights are suspicious. Ah! man of darkness\r\nthat you are!\r\n\r\n                       *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nLet us return to the butchery on the boulevard, to the words, \"Let my\r\norders be executed!\" and to the day of the 4th.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte, during the evening of that day, must have compared\r\nhimself to Charles X, who refused to burn Paris, and to Louis Philippe,\r\nwho would not shed the people's blood, and he must have done himself\r\nthe justice to admit that he is a great politician. A few days later,\r\nGeneral T----, formerly in the service of one of the sons of King Louis\r\nPhilippe, came to the Élysée. As soon as Louis Bonaparte caught sight\r\nof him, the comparison we have just pointed out suggesting itself to\r\nhim, he cried out to the general, exultingly: \"Well?\"\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte is in very truth the man who said to one of his former\r\nministers, who was our own informant: \"_Had I been Charles X, and had\r\nI, during the days of July, caught Laffitte, Benjamin Constant, and\r\nLafayette, I would have had them shot like dogs._\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, Louis Bonaparte would have been dragged that\r\nvery night from the Élysée, and the law would have prevailed, had he\r\nbeen one of those men who recoil before a massacre. Fortunately for\r\nhim, he had no such scruples. What signified a few dead bodies, more or\r\nless? Nonsense! kill! kill at random! cut them down! shoot, cannonade,\r\ncrush, smash! Strike terror for me into this hateful city of Paris! The\r\n_coup d'état_ was in a bad way; this great homicide restored its\r\nspirit. Louis Bonaparte had nearly ruined himself by his felony; he\r\nsaved himself by his ferocity. Had he been only a Faliero, it was all\r\nover with him; fortunately he was a Cæsar Borgia. He plunged with his\r\ncrime into a river of gore; one less culpable would have sunk, he swam\r\nacross. Such was his success as it is called. He is now on the other\r\nbank, striving to wipe himself dry, dripping with the blood which he\r\nmistakes for the purple, and demanding the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSEQUEL OF CRIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a man is this malefactor!\r\n\r\nAnd shall we not applaud thee, O Truth! when, in the eyes of Europe and\r\nof the world, before the people, in the face of God, while he appealed\r\nto honour, the sanctity of an oath, faith, religion, the sacredness of\r\nhuman life, the law, the generosity of all hearts, wives, sisters,\r\nmothers, civilization, liberty, the republic, France; before his\r\nvalets, his Senate and his Council of State; before his generals, his\r\npriests, and his police agents,--thou who representest the people (for\r\nthe people is truth); thou who representest intelligence (for\r\nintelligence is enlightenment); thou who representest humanity (for\r\nhumanity is reason); in the name of the enthralled people, in the name\r\nof exiled intelligence, in the name of outraged humanity, before this\r\nmass of slaves who cannot, or dare not, speak, thou dost scourge this\r\nbrigand of order.\r\n\r\nLet some one else choose milder words. I am outspoken and harsh; I have\r\nno pity for this pitiless man, and I glory in it.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed.\r\n\r\nTo what we have just related add all the other crimes, to which we\r\nshall have occasion to return more than once, and the history of which,\r\nGod granting us life, we shall relate in detail. Add the numberless\r\nincarcerations attended with circumstances of ferocity, the overgorged\r\nprisons,[1] the sequestration of property[2] of the proscribed in ten\r\ndepartments, notably in La Nièvre, in L'Allier, and in Les\r\nBasses-Alpes; add the confiscation of the Orleans property, with the\r\nslice allotted to the clergy. Schinderhannes never forgot to share with\r\nthe curé. Add the mixed commissions, and the commission of clemency, so\r\ncalled;[3] the councils of war combined with the examining magistrates,\r\nand, multiplying the instances of abomination, the batches of exiles,\r\nthe expulsion of a part of France out of France (the department of the\r\nHerault, alone, furnishing 3,200 persons, either banished or\r\ntransported); add the appalling proscription,--comparable to the most\r\ntragic devastations in history,--which for an impulse, for an opinion,\r\nfor an honest dissent from the government, for the mere word of a\r\nfreeman, even when uttered before the 2nd of December, takes, seizes,\r\napprehends, tears away the labourer from the field, the working-man\r\nfrom his trade, the house-holder from his house, the physician from his\r\npatients, the notary from his office, the counsellor from his clients,\r\nthe judge from his court, the husband from his wife, the brother from\r\nhis brother, the father from his children, the child from his parents,\r\nand marks its ill-omened cross on every head, from the highest to the\r\nlowest. Nobody escapes. A man in tatters, wearing a long beard, came\r\ninto my room one morning at Brussels. \"I have just arrived,\" said he;\r\n\"I have travelled on foot, and have had nothing to eat for two days.\"\r\nSome bread was given him. He ate. \"Where do you come from?\"--\"From\r\nLimoges.\"--\"Why are you here?\"--\"I don't know; they drove me away from\r\nmy home.\"--\"What are you?\"--\"A maker of wooden shoes.\"\r\n\r\n      [1] The _Bulletin des Lois_ publishes the following decree,\r\n      dated the 27th of March:--\r\n\r\n          \"Considering the law of May 10, 1838, which classes the\r\n          ordinary expenses of the provincial prisons with those to be\r\n          included in the departmental budgets:\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas this is not the nature of the expenses occasioned by\r\n          the arrests resulting from the events of December;\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas the facts which have caused these arrests to\r\n          multiply are connected with _a plot against the safety of\r\n          the state_, the suppression of which concerned society at\r\n          large, and therefore it is just to discharge out of the\r\n          public funds the excess of expenditure resulting from the\r\n          _extraordinary increase_ in the number of prisoners;\r\n\r\n          \"It is decreed that:--\r\n\r\n          \"An extraordinary credit of 250,000f. be opened, at the\r\n          Ministry of the Interior, on the revenue of 1851, to be\r\n          applied to the liquidation of the expenses resulting from the\r\n          arrests consequent on the events of December.\"\r\n\r\n      [2] \"Digne, January 5, 1852.\r\n\r\n          \"The Colonel commanding the state of siege in the department\r\n          of the Basses-Alpes\r\n\r\n          \"Decrees:--\r\n\r\n          \"Within the course of ten days the property of the fugitives\r\n          from the law _will be sequestrated_, and administered by\r\n          the director of public lands in the Basses-Alpes, according\r\n          to civil and military laws, etc.    FRIRION.\"\r\n\r\n      Ten similar decrees, emanating from the commanders of states of\r\n      siege, might be quoted.

On December 18, he placed under sequestration the\r\n      property of a number of citizens of Moulins, \"because,\" as he\r\n      cynically observed, \"_the beginning of the insurrection leaves\r\n      no doubt_ as to the part they took _in the insurrection_, and in\r\n      the pillaging in the department of the Allier.\"\r\n\r\n      [3] The number of _convictions_ actually upheld (in most cases\r\n      the sentences were of transportation) was declared to be as\r\n      follows, at the date of the reports:--\r\n\r\n          By M.

Add all these poor wretches handed over to\r\ngendarmes, bound two by two, packed in the lower decks of the\r\n_Magellan_, the _Canada_, the _Duguesclin_; cast among the convicts\r\nof Lambessa and Cayenne, not knowing what there is against them, and\r\nunable to guess what they have done. One of them, Alphonse Lambert, of\r\nthe Indre, torn from his death-bed; another, Patureau Francoeur, a\r\nvine-dresser, transported, because in his village they wanted to make\r\nhim president of the republic; a third, Valette, a carpenter at\r\nChâteauroux, transported for having, six months previous to the 2nd of\r\nDecember, on the day of an execution, refused to erect the guillotine.\r\n\r\nAdd to these the man-hunting in the villages, the _battue_ of\r\nViroy in the mountains of Lure, Pellion's _battue_ in the woods of\r\nClamecy, with fifteen hundred men; order restored at Crest--out of two\r\nthousand insurgents, three hundred slain; mobile columns everywhere.\r\nWhoever stands up for the law, sabred and shot: at Marseilles, Charles\r\nSauvan exclaims, \"Long live the Republic!\" a grenadier of the 54th\r\nfires at him; the ball enters his side, and comes out of his belly;\r\nanother, Vincent, of Bourges, is deputy-mayor of his commune: as a\r\nmagistrate he protests against the _coup d'état_; they track him\r\nthrough the village, he flies, he is pursued, a cavalryman cuts off two\r\nof his fingers with his sword, another cleaves his head, he falls; they\r\nremove him to the fort at Ivry before dressing his wounds; he is an old\r\nman of seventy-six.\r\n\r\nAdd facts like these: in the Cher, Representative Vignier is arrested.\r\nArrested for what? Because he is a representative, because he is\r\ninviolable, because he is consecrated by the votes of the people.\r\nVignier is cast into prison. One day he is allowed to go out _for one\r\nhour_ to attend to certain matters which imperatively demand his\r\npresence. Before he went out two gendarmes, Pierre Guéret and one\r\nDubernelle, a brigadier, seized Vignier; the brigadier held his hands\r\nagainst each other so that the palms touched, and bound his wrists\r\ntightly with a chain; as the end of the chain hung down, the brigadier\r\nforced it between Vignier's hands, over and over, at the risk of\r\nfracturing his wrists by the pressure. The prisoner's hands turned blue\r\nand swelled.--\"You are putting me to the question,\" said Vignier\r\ncoolly.--\"Hide your hands,\" sneered the gendarme, \"if you're\r\nashamed.\"--\"You hound,\" retorted Vignier, \"you are the one of us two\r\nthat this chain dishonors.\"--In this wise Vignier passed through the\r\nstreets of Bourges where he had lived thirty years--between two\r\ngendarmes, with his hands raised, exhibiting his chains. Representative\r\nVignier is seventy years old.\r\n\r\nAdd the summary fusillades in twenty departments; \"All who resist,\"\r\nwrites Saint-Arnaud, Minister of War, \"are to be shot, in the name of\r\nsociety defending itself.\"[4] \"Six days have sufficed to _crush_ the\r\ninsurrection,\" states General Levaillant, who commanded the state of\r\nsiege in the Var. \"I have made some good captures,\" writes Commandant\r\nViroy from Saint-Étienne; \"I have shot, without stirring, eight\r\npersons, and am now in pursuit of the leaders in the woods.\" At\r\nBordeaux, General Bourjoly enjoins the leaders of the mobile columns to\r\n\"have shot forthwith every person caught with arms in his hands.\" At\r\nForcalquier, it was better still; the proclamation declaring the state\r\nof siege reads:--\"The town of Forcalquier is in a state of siege. Those\r\ncitizens who _took no part_ in the day's events, and those who have\r\narms in their possession, are summoned to give them up on pain of being\r\nshot.\" The mobile column of Pézenas arrives at Servian: a man tries to\r\nescape from a house surrounded by soldiers; he is shot at and killed.\r\nAt Entrains, eighty prisoners are taken; one of them escapes by the\r\nriver, he is fired at, struck by a ball, and disappears under the\r\nwater; the rest are shot. To these execrable deeds, add these infamous\r\nones: at Brioude, in Haute-Loire, a man and woman thrown into prison\r\nfor having ploughed the field of one of the proscribed; at Loriol, in\r\nthe Drôme, Astier, a forest-keeper, condemned to twenty years' hard\r\nlabour, for having sheltered fugitives. Add too, and my pen shakes as I\r\nwrite it, the punishment of death revived; the political guillotine\r\nre-erected; shocking sentences; citizens condemned to death on the\r\nscaffold by the judicial janissaries of the courts-martial: at Clamecy,\r\nMilletot, Jouannin, Guillemot, Sabatier, and Four; at Lyon, Courty,\r\nRomegal, Bressieux, Fauritz, Julien, Roustain, and Garan, deputy-mayor\r\nof Cliouscat; at Montpellier, seventeen for the affair of Bédarieux,\r\nMercadier, Delpech, Denis, André, Barthez, Triadou, Pierre Carrière,\r\nGalzy, Galas (called Le Vacher), Gardy, Jacques Pagès, Michel Hercule,\r\nMar, Vène, Frié, Malaterre, Beaumont, Pradal, the six last luckily\r\nbeing out of the jurisdiction; and at Montpellier four more, Choumac,\r\nVidal, Cadelard and Pagès. What was the crime of these men? Their crime\r\nis yours, if you are a good subject; it is mine, who writes these\r\nlines; it is obedience to Article 110 of the Constitution; it is armed\r\nresistance to Louis Bonaparte's crime; and the court \"orders that the\r\nexecution shall take place in the usual way on one of the public\r\nsquares of Béziers,\" with respect to the last four, and, in the case of\r\nthe other seventeen, on one of the squares at Bédarieux. The _Moniteur_\r\nannounces it; it is true that the _Moniteur_ announces, at the same\r\ntime, that the service of the last ball at the Tuileries was performed\r\nby three hundred maîtres d'hôtel, habited in the liveries rigorously\r\nprescribed by the ceremonial of the old imperial palace.\r\n\r\n      [4] Read the odious despatch, copied verbatim from the\r\n      _Moniteur_:\r\n\r\n          \"The armed insurrection has been totally suppressed in Paris\r\n          by vigorous measures. The same energy will produce the same\r\n          effect everywhere else.\r\n\r\n          \"Bands of people who spread pillage, rapine, and fire, place\r\n          themselves outside of the law. With them one does not argue\r\n          or warn; one attacks and disperses them.\r\n\r\n          \"All who resist must be SHOT, in the name of society\r\n          defending itself.\"\r\n\r\nUnless a universal cry of horror should stop this man in time, all\r\nthese heads will fall.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are writing, this is what has just occurred at Belley:--\r\n\r\nA native of Bugez, near Belley, a working-man, named Charlet, had\r\nwarmly advocated, on the 10th of December, 1848, the election of Louis\r\nBonaparte. He had distributed circulars, supported, propagated, and\r\nhawked them; the election was in his eyes a triumph; he hoped in\r\nLouis-Napoleon; he took seriously the socialist writings of the\r\nprisoner of Ham, and his \"philanthropical\" and \"republican\" programmes:\r\non the 10th of December there were many such honest dupes; they are now\r\nthe most indignant. When Louis Bonaparte was in power, when they saw\r\nthe man at work, these illusions vanished. Charlet, a man of\r\nintelligence, was one of those whose republican probity was outraged,\r\nand gradually, as Louis Bonaparte plunged deeper and deeper into\r\nreactionary measures, Charlet shook himself free; thus did he pass from\r\nthe most confiding partisanship to the most open and zealous\r\nopposition. Such is the history of many other noble hearts.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of December, Charlet did not hesitate. In the face of the\r\nmany crimes combined in the infamous deed of Louis Bonaparte, Charlet\r\nfelt the law stirring within him; he reflected that he ought to be the\r\nmore severe, because he was one of those whose trust had been most\r\nbetrayed. He clearly understood that there remained but one duty for\r\nthe citizen, a bounden duty, inseparable from the law,--to defend the\r\nRepublic and the Constitution, and to resist by every means the man\r\nwhom the Left, but still more his own crime, had outlawed. The refugees\r\nfrom Switzerland passed the frontier in arms, crossed the Rhône, near\r\nAnglefort, and entered the department of the Ain. Charlet joined their\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nAt Seyssel, the little troop fell in with the custom-house officers.\r\nThe latter, voluntary or misled accomplices of the _coup d'état_,\r\nchose to resist their passage. A conflict ensued, one of the officers\r\nwas killed, and Charlet was made prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ brought Charlet before a court-martial. He was\r\ncharged with the death of the custom-house officer, which, after all,\r\nwas but an incident of war. At all events, Charlet was innocent of that\r\ndeath; the officer was killed by a bullet, and Charlet had no weapon\r\nbut a sharpened file.\r\n\r\nCharlet would not recognize as a lawful court the body of men who\r\npretended to sit in judgment on him. He said to them: \"You are no\r\njudges; where is the law? The law is on my side.\" He refused to answer\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nQuestioned on the subject of the officer's death, he could have cleared\r\nup the whole matter by a single word; but to descend to an explanation\r\nwould, to a certain extent, have been a recognition of the tribunal. He\r\ndid not choose to recognize it, so he held his peace.\r\n\r\nThese men condemned him to die, \"according to the usual mode of\r\ncriminal executions.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence pronounced, he seemed to have been forgotten; days, weeks,\r\nmonths elapsed. Everybody about the prison said to Charlet, \"You are\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, at break of day, the town of Belley saw a mournful\r\nsight. The scaffold had risen from the earth during the night, and\r\nstood in the middle of the public square.\r\n\r\nThe people accosted one another, pale as death, and asked: \"Have you\r\nseen what there is in the square?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"Whom is it for?\"\r\n\r\nIt was for Charlet.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of death had been referred to M. Bonaparte, it had\r\nslumbered a long time at the Élysée; there was other business to attend\r\nto; but one fine morning, after a lapse of seven months, all the world\r\nhaving forgotten the conflict at Seyssel, the slain custom-house\r\nofficer, and Charlet himself, M. Bonaparte, wanting most likely to\r\ninsert some event between the festival of the 10th of May and the\r\nfestival of the 15th of August, signed the warrant for the execution.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, therefore, only a few days ago, Charlet was\r\nremoved from his prison. They told him he was about to die. He\r\ncontinued calm. A man who has justice on his side does not fear death,\r\nfor he feels that there are two things within him: one, his body, which\r\nmay be put to death, the other, justice, whose hands are not bound, nor\r\ndoes its head fall beneath the knife.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to make Charlet ride in a cart. \"No,\" said he to the\r\ngendarmes, \"I will go on foot, I can walk, I am not afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great crowd along his route. Every one in the town knew him\r\nand loved him; his friends sought his eye. Charlet, his arms fastened\r\nbehind his back, bowed his head right and left. \"Adieu, Jacques! adieu,\r\nPierre!\" said he, smiling. \"Adieu, Charlet!\" they answered, and all of\r\nthem wept. The gendarmerie and the infantry surrounded the scaffold. He\r\nascended it with slow and steady steps. When they saw him standing on\r\nthe scaffold, a shudder ran through the crowd; the women cried aloud,\r\nthe men clenched their fists.\r\n\r\nWhile they were strapping him to the plank, he looked up at the knife,\r\nsaying: \"When I reflect that I was once a Bonapartist!\" Then, raising\r\nhis eyes to Heaven, he exclaimed, \"Vive la République!\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment his head fell.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of mourning at Belley and through all the villages of the\r\nAin. \"How did he die?\" people would ask.--\"Bravely.\"--\"God be praised!\"\r\n\r\nIn this wise a man has been killed.\r\n\r\nThe mind succumbs and is lost in horror in presence of a deed so\r\ndamnable.\r\n\r\nThis crime being added to the rest complements and sets a sinister sort\r\nof seal upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is more than the complement, it is the crowning act.\r\n\r\nOne feels that M. Bonaparte ought to be satisfied! To have shot down at\r\nnight, in the dark, in solitude, on the Champ-de-Mars, under the arches\r\nof the bridges, behind a lonely wall, at random, haphazard, no matter\r\nwhom, unknown persons, shadows, the very number of whom none can tell;\r\nto cause nameless persons to be slain by nameless persons; and to have\r\nall this vanish in obscurity, in oblivion, is, in very truth, far from\r\ngratifying to one's self-esteem; it looks like hiding one's self, and\r\nin truth that is what it is; it is commonplace. Scrupulous men have the\r\nright to say to you: \"You know you are afraid; you would not dare to do\r\nthese things publicly; you shrink from your own acts.\" And, to a\r\ncertain extent, they seem to be right. To shoot down people by night is\r\na violation of every law, human and divine, but it lacks audacity. One\r\ndoes not feel triumphant afterwards. Something better is possible.\r\n\r\nBroad daylight, the public square, the judicial scaffold, the regular\r\napparatus of social vengeance--to hand the innocent over to these, to\r\nput them to death in this manner, ah! that is different. I can\r\nunderstand that. To commit a murder at high noon, in the heart of the\r\ntown, by means of one machine called court, or court-martial, and of\r\nanother machine slowly erected by a carpenter, adjusted, put together,\r\nscrewed and greased at pleasure; to say it shall be at such an hour;\r\nthen to display two baskets, and say: \"This one is for the body, that\r\nother for the head;\" at the appointed time to bring the victim bound\r\nwith ropes, attended by a priest; to proceed calmly to the murder, to\r\norder a clerk to prepare a report of it, to surround the murder victim\r\nwith gendarmes and naked swords, so that the people there may shudder,\r\nand no longer know what they see, and wonder whether those men in\r\nuniform are a brigade of gendarmerie or a band of robbers, and ask one\r\nanother, looking at the man who lets the knife fall, whether he is the\r\nexecutioner or whether he is not rather an assassin! This is bold and\r\nresolute, this is a parody of legal procedure, most audacious and\r\nalluring, and worth being carried out. This is a noble and\r\nfar-spreading blow on the cheek of justice. Commend us to this!\r\n\r\nTo do this seven months after the struggle, in cold blood, to no\r\npurpose, as an omission that one repairs, as a duty that one fulfills,\r\nis awe-inspiring, it is complete; one has the appearance of acting\r\nwithin one's rights, which perplexes the conscience and makes honest\r\nmen shudder.\r\n\r\nA terrible juxtaposition, which comprehends the whole case. Here are\r\ntwo men, a working-man and a prince. The prince commits a crime, he\r\nenters the Tuileries; the working-man does his duty, he ascends the\r\nscaffold. Who set up the working-man's scaffold? The prince!\r\n\r\nYes, this man who, had he been beaten in December, could have escaped\r\nthe death penalty only by the omnipotence of progress, and by an\r\nenlargement, too liberal certainly, of the principle that human life is\r\nsacred; this man, this Louis Bonaparte, this prince who carries the\r\npractices of Poulmann and Soufflard into politics, he it is who\r\nrebuilds the scaffold! Nor does he tremble! Nor does he turn pale! Nor\r\ndoes he feel that it is a fatal ladder, that he is at liberty to\r\nrefrain from erecting it, but that, when once it is erected, he is not\r\nat liberty to take it down, and that he who sets it up for another,\r\nafterwards finds it for himself. It knows him again, and says to him,\r\n\"Thou didst place me here, and I have awaited thee.\"\r\n\r\nNo, this man does not reflect, he has longings, he has whims, and they\r\nmust be satisfied. They are the longings of a dictator. Unlimited power\r\nwould be tasteless without this seasoning. Go to,--cut off Charlet's\r\nhead, and the others. M. Bonaparte is Prince-President of the French\r\nRepublic; M. Bonaparte has sixteen millions a year, forty-four thousand\r\nfrancs a day, twenty-four cooks in his household, and as many\r\naides-de-camp; he has the right of fishing in the ponds of Saclay and\r\nSaint-Quentin; of hunting in the forests of Laigne, Ourscamp,\r\nCarlemont, Champagne and Barbeau; he has the Tuileries, the Louvre, the\r\nÉlysée, Rambouillet, Saint-Cloud, Versailles, Compiègne; he has his\r\nimperial box at every theatre, feasting and music every day, M.\r\nSibour's smile, and the arm of the Marchioness of Douglas on which to\r\nenter the ballroom; but all this is not enough; he must have the\r\nguillotine to boot; he must have some of those red baskets among his\r\nbaskets of champagne.\r\n\r\nOh! hide we our faces with both our hands! This man, this hideous\r\nbutcher of the law and of justice, still had his apron round his waist\r\nand his hands in the smoking bowels of the Constitution, and his feet\r\nin the blood of all the slaughtered laws, when you, judges, when you,\r\nmagistrates, men of the law, men of the right...! But I pause; I shall\r\nmeet you hereafter with your black robes and your red robes, your robes\r\nof the colour of ink, and your robes of the colour of blood; and I\r\nshall find them, too, and having chastised them once, will chastise\r\nthem again--those lieutenants of yours, those judicial supporters of\r\nthe ambuscade, those soilers of the ermine,--Baroche, Suin, Royer,\r\nMongis, Rouher, and Troplong, deserters from the law,--all those names\r\nwhich signify nothing more than the utmost contempt which man can feel.\r\n\r\nIf he did not crush his victims between two boards, like Christiern II;\r\nif he did not bury people alive, like Ludovic the Moor; if he did not\r\nbuild his palace walls with living men and stones, like Timour-Beg, who\r\nwas born, says the legend, with his hands closed and full of blood; if\r\nhe did not rip open pregnant women, like Cæsar Borgia, Duke of\r\nValentinois; if he did not scourge women on the breasts, _testibusque\r\nviros_, like Ferdinand of Toledo; if he did not break on the wheel\r\nalive, burn alive, boil alive, flay alive, crucify, impale, and\r\nquarter, blame him not, the fault was not his; the age obstinately\r\nrefuses to allow it. He has done all that was humanly or inhumanly\r\npossible. Given the nineteenth century, a century of gentleness,--of\r\ndecadence, say the papists and friends of arbitrary power,--Louis\r\nBonaparte has equalled in ferocity his contemporaries, Haynau,\r\nRadetzky, Filangieri, Schwartzenberg, and Ferdinand of Naples: he has\r\neven surpassed them. A rare merit, with which we must credit him as\r\nanother impediment: the scene was laid in France. Let us do him this\r\njustice: in the times in which we live, Ludovic Sforza, the\r\nValentinois, the Duke of Alva, Timour, and Christiern II, would have\r\ndone no more than Louis Bonaparte; in their time, he would have done\r\nall that they did; in our time, just as they were about to erect their\r\ngibbets, their wheels, their wooden horses, their cranes, their living\r\ntowers, their crosses, and their stakes, they would have desisted like\r\nhim, in spite of themselves, and unconsciously, before the secret and\r\ninvincible resistance of the moral environment, of that formidable and\r\nmysterious interdiction of an entire epoch, which rises in the north,\r\nthe south, the east, and the west, to confront tyrants, and says no to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWHAT 1852 WOULD HAVE BEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, had it not been for this abominable 2nd of December, which its\r\naccomplices, and after them its dupes, call \"necessary,\" what would\r\nhave occurred in France? Mon Dieu! this:--\r\n\r\nLet us go back a little, and review, in a summary way, the situation as\r\nit was before the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nThe party of the past, under the name of order, opposed the republic,\r\nor in other words, opposed the future.\r\n\r\nWhether opposed or not, whether assented to or not, the republic, all\r\nillusions apart, is the future, proximate or remote, but inevitable, of\r\nthe nations.\r\n\r\nHow is the republic to be established? There are two ways of\r\nestablishing it: by strife and by progress. The democrats would arrive\r\nat it by progress; their adversaries, the men of the past, appear to\r\ndesire to arrive at it by strife.\r\n\r\nAs we have just observed, the men of the past are for resisting; they\r\npersist; they apply the axe to the tree, expecting to stop the mounting\r\nsap. They lavish their strength, their puerility, and their anger.\r\n\r\nLet us not utter a single bitter word against our old adversaries,\r\nfallen with ourselves on the same day, and several among them with\r\nhonour on their side; let us confine ourselves to noting that it was\r\ninto this struggle that the majority of the Legislative Assembly of\r\nFrance entered at the very beginning of its career, in the month of\r\nMay, 1849.\r\n\r\nThis policy of resistance is a deplorable policy. This struggle between\r\nman and his Maker is inevitably vain; but, though void of result, it is\r\nfruitful in catastrophes. That which ought to be will be; that which\r\nought to flow will flow; that which ought to fall will fall; that which\r\nought to spring up will spring up; that which ought to grow will grow;\r\nbut, obstruct these natural laws, confusion follows, disorder begins.\r\nIt is a melancholy fact that it was this disorder which was called\r\norder.\r\n\r\nTie up a vein, and sickness ensues; clog up a stream, and the water\r\noverflows; obstruct the future, and revolutions break out.\r\n\r\nPersist in preserving among you, as if it were alive, the past, which\r\nis dead, and you produce an indescribable moral cholera; corruption\r\nspreads abroad, it is in the air, we breathe it; entire classes of\r\nsociety, the public officials, for instance, fall into decay. Keep dead\r\nbodies in your houses, the plague will break out.\r\n\r\nThis policy inevitably makes blind those who adopt it. Those men who\r\ndub themselves statesmen do not understand that they themselves have\r\nmade, with their own hands and with untold labour, and with the sweat\r\nof their brows, the terrible events they deplore, and that the very\r\ncatastrophes which fall upon them were by them constructed. What would\r\nbe said of a peasant who should build a dam from one side of a river to\r\nthe other, in front of his cottage, and who, when he saw the river\r\nturned into a torrent, overflow, sweep away his wall, and carry off his\r\nroof, should exclaim: \"Wicked river!\"? The statesmen of the past, those\r\ngreat builders of dams across streams, spend their time in exclaiming:\r\n\"Wicked people!\"\r\n\r\nTake away Polignac and the July ordinances, that is to say, the dam,\r\nand Charles X would have died at the Tuileries. Reform in 1847 the\r\nelectoral laws, that is to say once more, take away the dam, and Louis\r\nPhilippe would have died on the throne. Do I mean thereby that the\r\nRepublic would not have come? Not so. The Republic, we repeat, is the\r\nfuture; it would have come, but step by step, successive progress by\r\nprogress, conquest by conquest, like a river that flows, and not like a\r\ndeluge that overflows; it would have come at its own hour, when all was\r\nready for it; it would have come, certainly not more enduring, for it\r\nis already indestructible, but more tranquil, free from all possibility\r\nof reaction, with no princes keeping watch, with no _coup d'état_\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe policy which obstructs the progress of mankind--let us insist on\r\nthis point--excels in producing artificial floods. Thus it had managed\r\nto render the year 1852 a sort of formidable eventuality, and this\r\nagain by the same contrivance, by means of a dam. Here is a railway; a\r\ntrain will pass in an hour; throw a beam across the rails, and when the\r\ntrain comes to that point it will be wrecked, as it was at Fampoux;\r\nremove the beam before the train arrives, and it will pass without even\r\nsuspecting the catastrophe recently lurking there. This beam is the law\r\nof the 31st of May.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the majority of the Legislative Assembly had thrown it\r\nacross 1852, and they cried: \"This is where society will be crushed!\"\r\nThe Left replied: \"Take away your beam, and let universal suffrage pass\r\nunobstructed.\" This is the whole history of the law of the 31st of May.\r\n\r\nThese are things for children to understand, but which \"statesmen\" do\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\nNow let us answer the question we just now proposed: Without the 2nd of\r\nDecember, what would have occurred in 1852?\r\n\r\nRevoke the law of the 31st of May, take away the dam from before the\r\npeople, deprive Bonaparte of his lever, his weapon, his pretext, let\r\nuniversal suffrage alone, take the beam off the rails, and do you know\r\nwhat you would have had in 1852?\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nElections.\r\n\r\nA sort of peaceful Sundays, when the people would have come forward to\r\nvote, labourers yesterday, today electors, to-morrow labourers, and\r\nalways sovereign.\r\n\r\nSomebody rejoins: \"Oh, yes, elections! You talk very glibly about them.\r\nBut what about the 'red chamber' which would have sprung from these\r\nelections.\"\r\n\r\nDid they not announce that the Constitution of 1848 would prove a \"red\r\nchamber?\" Red chambers, red hobgoblins, all such predictions are of\r\nequal value. Those who wave such phantasmagorias on the end of a stick\r\nbefore the terrified populace know well what they are doing, and laugh\r\nbehind the ghastly rag they wave. Beneath the long scarlet robe of the\r\nphantom, to which had been given the name of 1852, we see the stout\r\nboots of the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE JACQUERIE\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after the 2nd of December, the crime being committed, it was\r\nimperative to mislead public opinion. The _coup d'état_ began to\r\nshriek about the Jacquerie, like the assassin who cried: \"Stop thief!\"\r\n\r\nWe may add, that a _Jacquerie_ had been promised, and that M. Bonaparte\r\ncould not break all his promises at once without some inconvenience.\r\nWhat but the Jacquerie was the red spectre? Some reality must be\r\nimparted to that spectre: one cannot suddenly burst out laughing in the\r\nface of a whole people and say: \"It was nothing! I only kept you in\r\nfear of yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently there was a _Jacquerie_. The promises of the play-bill\r\nwere observed.\r\n\r\nThe imaginations of his entourage gave themselves a free rein; that old\r\nbugbear Mother Goose was resuscitated, and many a child, on reading the\r\nnewspaper, might have recognized the ogre of Goodman Perrault in the\r\ndisguise of a socialist; they surmised, they invented; the press being\r\nsuppressed, it was quite easy; it is easy to lie when the tongue of\r\ncontradiction has been torn out beforehand.\r\n\r\nThey exclaimed: \"Citizens, be on your guard! without us you were lost.\r\nWe shot you, but that was for your good. Behold, the Lollards were at\r\nyour gates, the Anabaptists were scaling your walls, the Hussites were\r\nknocking at your window-blinds, the lean and hungry were climbing your\r\nstaircases, the empty-bellied coveted your dinner. Be on your guard!\r\nHave not some of your good women been outraged?\"\r\n\r\nThey gave the floor to one of the principal writers in _La Patrie_, one\r\nFroissard.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not write or describe the horrible and improper things they did\r\nto the ladies. But among other disorderly and villainous injuries, they\r\nkilled a chevalier and put a spit through him, and turned him before\r\nthe fire, and roasted him before the wife and her children. After ten\r\nor twelve had violated the woman, they tried to make her and the\r\nchildren eat some of the body; then killed them, put them to an evil\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"These wicked people pillaged and burned everything; they killed, and\r\nforced, and violated all the women and maidens, without pity or mercy,\r\nas if they were mad dogs.\r\n\r\n\"Quite in the same manner did lawless people conduct themselves between\r\nParis and Noyon, between Paris and Soissons and Ham in Vermandois, all\r\nthrough the land of Coucy. There were the great violators and\r\nmalefactors; and, in the county of Valois, in the bishopric of Laon, of\r\nSoissons, and of Noyon, they destroyed upwards of a hundred châteaux\r\nand goodly houses of knights and squires, and killed and robbed all\r\nthey met. But _God_, by his grace, found a fit remedy, for which all\r\npraise be given to him.\"\r\n\r\nPeople simply substituted for God, Monseigneur le Prince-President.\r\nThey could do no less.\r\n\r\nNow that eight months have elapsed, we know what to think of this\r\n\"Jacquerie;\" the facts have at length been brought to light. Where?\r\nHow? Why, before the very tribunals of M. Bonaparte. The sub-prefects\r\nwhose wives had been violated were single men; the curés who had been\r\nroasted alive, and whose hearts Jacques had eaten, have written to say\r\nthat they are quite well; the gendarmes, round whose bodies others had\r\ndanced have been heard as witnesses before the courts-martial; the\r\npublic coffers, said to have been rifled, have been found intact in the\r\nhands of M. Bonaparte, who \"saved\" them; the famous deficit of five\r\nthousand francs, at Clamecy, has dwindled down to two hundred expended\r\nin orders for bread. An official publication had said, on the 8th of\r\nDecember: \"The curé, the mayor, and the sub-prefect of Joigny, besides\r\nseveral gendarmes, have been basely massacred.\" Somebody replied to\r\nthis in a letter, which was made public; \"Not a drop of blood was shed\r\nat Joigny; nobody's life was threatened.\" Now, by whom was this letter\r\nwritten? This same mayor of Joigny who had been _basely massacred_, M.\r\nHenri de Lacretelle, from whom an armed band had extorted two thousand\r\nfrancs, at his château of Cormatin, is amazed, to this day, not at the\r\nextortion, but at the fable. M. de Lamartine, whom another band had\r\nintended to plunder, and probably to hang on the lamp-post, and whose\r\nchâteau of Saint-Point was burned, and who \"had written to demand\r\ngovernment assistance,\" knew nothing of the matter until he saw it in\r\nthe papers!\r\n\r\nThe following document was produced before the court-martial in the\r\nNièvre, presided over by ex-Colonel Martinprey:--\r\n\r\n    \"ORDER OF THE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n    \"_Honesty is a virtue of republicans._\r\n\r\n    \"_Every thief and plunderer will be shot._\r\n\r\n    \"_Every detainer of arms who, in the course of twelve hours, shall\r\n    not have deposited them at the mayor's office, or given them up,\r\n    shall be arrested and confined until further orders._\r\n\r\n    \"_Every drunken citizen shall be disarmed and sent to prison._\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Clamecy, December 7, 1851._\r\n\r\n    \"_Vive la république sociale!_\r\n\r\n    \"THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE.\"\r\n\r\nThis that you have just read is the proclamation of \"Jacques.\" \"Death\r\nto the pillagers! death to the thieves!\" Such is the cry of these\r\nthieves and pillagers.\r\n\r\nOne of these \"Jacques,\" named Gustave Verdun-Lagarde, a native of\r\nLot-Garonne, died in exile at Brussels, on the 1st of May, 1852,\r\nbequeathing one hundred thousand francs to his native town, to found a\r\nschool of agriculture. This partitioner did indeed make partition.\r\n\r\nThere was not, then, and the honest co-authors of the _coup d'état_\r\nadmit it now to their intimates, with playful delight, there was not\r\nany \"Jacquerie,\" it is true; but the trick has told.\r\n\r\nThere was in the departments, as there was in Paris, a lawful\r\nresistance, the resistance prescribed to the citizens by Article 110 of\r\nthe Constitution, and superior to the Constitution by natural right;\r\nthere was the legitimate defence--this time the word is properly\r\napplied--against the \"preservers;\" the armed struggle of right and law\r\nagainst the infamous insurrection of the ruling powers. The Republic,\r\nsurprised by an ambuscade, wrestled with the _coup d'état_. That\r\nis all.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven departments rose in arms: the Ain, the Aude, the Cher, the\r\nBouches du Rhône, the Côte d'Or, the Haute-Garonne, Lot-et-Garonne, the\r\nLoiret, the Marne, the Meurthe, the Nord, the Bas-Rhin, the Rhône,\r\nSeine-et-Marne, did their duty worthily; the Allier, the Basses-Alpes,\r\nthe Aveyron, the Drome, the Gard, the Gers, the Hérault, the Jura, the\r\nNièvre, the Puy-de-Dôme, Saône-et-Loire, the Var and Vaucluse, did\r\ntheirs fearlessly. They succumbed, as did Paris.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ was as ferocious there as at Paris. We have cast\r\na summary glance at its crimes.\r\n\r\nSo, then, it was this lawful, constitutional, virtuous resistance, this\r\nresistance in which heroism was on the side of the citizens, and\r\natrocity on the side of the powers; it was this which the _coup\r\nd'état_ called \"Jacquerie.\" We repeat, a touch of red spectre was\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThis Jacquerie had two aims; it served the policy of the Elysée in two\r\nways; it offered a double advantage: first, to win votes for the\r\n\"plebiscite;\" to win these votes by the sword and in face of the\r\nspectre, to repress the intelligent, to alarm the credulous, compelling\r\nsome by terror, others by fear, as we shall shortly explain; therein\r\nlies all the success and mystery of the vote of the 20th of December;\r\nsecondly, it afforded a pretext for proscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe year 1852 in itself contained no actual danger. The law of the 31st\r\nof May, morally extinct, was dead before the 2nd of December. A new\r\nAssembly, a new President, the Constitution simply put in operation,\r\nelections,--and nothing more.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary that M. Bonaparte should go. There was the\r\nobstacle; thence the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThus, then, did this man one fine morning seize by the throat the\r\nConstitution, the Republic, the Law, and France; he stabbed the future\r\nin the back; under his feet he trampled law, common sense, justice,\r\nreason, and liberty; he arrested men who were inviolable, he\r\nsequestered innocent men; in the persons of their representatives he\r\nseized the people in his grip; he raked the Paris boulevards with his\r\nshot; he made his cavalry wallow in the blood of old men and of women;\r\nhe shot without warning and without trial; he filled Mazas, the\r\nConciergerie, Saint-Pélagie, Vincennes, his fortresses, his cells, his\r\ncasemates, his dungeons, with prisoners, and his cemeteries with\r\ncorpses; he incarcerated, at Saint-Lazare, a wife who was carrying\r\nbread to her husband in hiding; he sent to the galleys for twenty\r\nyears, a man who had harboured one of the proscribed; he tore up every\r\ncode of laws, broke every enactment; he caused the deported to rot by\r\nthousands in the horrible holds of the hulks; he sent to Lambessa and\r\nCayenne one hundred and fifty children between twelve and fifteen; he\r\nwho was more absurd than Falstaff, has become more terrible than\r\nRichard III; and why has all this been done? Because there was, he\r\nsaid, \"a plot against his power;\" because the year which was closing\r\nhad a treasonable understanding with the year which was beginning to\r\noverthrow him; because Article 45 perfidiously concerted with the\r\ncalendar to turn him out; because the second Sunday in May intended to\r\n\"depose\" him; because his oath had the audacity to plot his fall;\r\nbecause his plighted word conspired against him.\r\n\r\nThe day after his triumph, he was heard to say: \"The second Sunday in\r\nMay is dead.\" No! it is probity that is dead! it is honour that is\r\ndead! it is the name of Emperor that is dead!\r\n\r\nHow the man sleeping in the chapel of St. Jerome must shudder, how he\r\nmust despair! Behold the gradual rise of unpopularity about his great\r\nfigure; and it is this ill-omened nephew who has placed the ladder. The\r\ngreat recollections are beginning to fade, the bad ones are returning.\r\nPeople dare no longer speak of Jena, Marengo, and Wagram. Of what do\r\nthey speak? Of the Duc d'Enghien, of Jaffa, of the 18th Brumaire. They\r\nforget the hero, and see only the despot. Caricature is beginning to\r\nsport with Cæsar's profile. And what a creature beside him! Some there\r\nare who confound the nephew with the uncle, to the delight of the\r\nÉlysée, but to the shame of France! The parodist assumes the airs of a\r\nstage manager. Alas! a splendour so infinite could not be tarnished\r\nsave by this boundless debasement! Yes! worse than Hudson Lowe! Hudson\r\nLowe was only a jailor, Hudson Lowe was only an executioner. The man\r\nwho has really assassinated Napoleon is Louis Bonaparte; Hudson Lowe\r\nkilled only his life, Louis Bonaparte is killing his glory.\r\n\r\nAh! the villain! he takes everything, he abuses everything, he sullies\r\neverything, he dishonours everything. He selects, for his ambuscade the\r\nmonth, the day, of Austerlitz. He returns from Satory as one would\r\nreturn from Aboukir. He conjures out of the 2nd of December I know not\r\nwhat bird of night, and perches it on the standard of France, and\r\nexclaims: \"Soldiers, behold the eagle.\" He borrows the hat from\r\nNapoleon, and the plume from Murat. He has his imperial etiquette, his\r\nchamberlains, his aides-de-camp, his courtiers. Under the Emperor, they\r\nwere kings, under him they are lackeys. He has his own policy, his own\r\n13th Vendémiaire, his own 18th Brumaire. Yes, he risks comparison! At\r\nthe Élysée, Napoleon the Great has disappeared: they say, \"_Uncle\r\nNapoleon_.\" The man of destiny has outdone Géronte. The perfect man\r\nis not the first, but this one. It is evident that the first came only\r\nto make the second's bed. Louis Bonaparte, in the midst of his valets\r\nand concubines, to satisfy the necessities of the table and the\r\nchamber, mingles the coronation, the oath, the Legion of Honour, the\r\ncamp of Boulogne, the Column Vendôme, Lodi, Arcola, Saint-Jean-d'Acre,\r\nEylau, Friedland, Champaubert--Ah! Frenchmen! look upon this hog\r\ncovered with slime strutting about in that lion's skin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n1789\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, more than sixty-three years ago, the French people, who had\r\nbeen the property of one family for upwards of eight hundred years, who\r\nhad been oppressed by the barons down to Louis XI, and since Louis XI\r\nby the parliaments, that is to say, to employ the frank remark of a\r\ngreat nobleman of the eighteenth century, \"who had been half eaten up\r\nby wolves and finished by vermin;\" who had been parcelled into\r\nprovinces, into châtellanies, into bailiwicks, and into seneschalries;\r\nwho had been exploited, squeezed, taxed, fleeced, peeled, shaven,\r\nshorn, clipped and abused without mercy, fined incessantly at the good\r\npleasure of their masters; governed, led, misled, overdriven, tortured;\r\nbeaten with sticks, and branded with red-hot irons for an oath; sent to\r\nthe galleys for killing a rabbit upon the king's grounds; hung for a\r\nmatter of five sous; contributing their millions to Versailles and\r\ntheir skeletons to Montfauçon; laden with prohibitions, with\r\nordinances, with patents, with royal letters, with edicts pecuniary and\r\nrural, with laws, with codes, with customs; ground to the earth with\r\nimposts, with fines, with quit-rents, with mortmains, import and export\r\nduties, rents, tithes, tolls, statute-labour, and bankruptcies;\r\ncudgelled with a cudgel called a sceptre; gasping, sweating, groaning,\r\nalways marching, crowned, but on their knees, rather a beast of burthen\r\nthan a nation,--the French people suddenly stood upright, determined to\r\nbe men, and resolved to demand an account of Providence, and to\r\nliquidate those eight centuries of misery. It was a noble effort!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMIRABEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nA large hall was chosen which was surrounded with benches, then they\r\ntook boards, and with these boards constructed, in the middle of the\r\nhall, a kind of platform. When this platform was finished, what in\r\nthose days was called the nation, that is to say, the clergy, in their\r\nred and violet robes, the nobility in spotless white, with their swords\r\nat their sides, and the bourgeoisie dressed in black, took their seats\r\nupon the benches. Scarcely were they seated when there was seen to\r\nascend the platform and there take its stand an extraordinary figure.\r\n\"Who is this monster?\" said some; \"Who is this giant?\" said others. It\r\nwas a singular being, unforeseen, unknown, emerging abruptly from the\r\nobscurity, who terrified, and who fascinated. A dreadful disease had\r\ngiven him a kind of tiger's head; every degree of ugliness seemed to\r\nhave been imprinted upon that mask by every possible vice. Like the\r\nbourgeoisie, he was dressed in black, that is to say, in mourning. His\r\nbloodshot eye cast upon the assembly a dazzling glance; it resembled\r\nmenace and reproach--all looked upon him with a degree of curiosity in\r\nwhich was mingled horror. He raised his hand, and there was silence.\r\n\r\nThen were heard to issue from this hideous face sublime words. It was\r\nthe voice of the new world speaking through the mouth of the old world;\r\nit was '89 that had risen, and was questioning, and accusing and\r\ndenouncing to God and man all the fatal dates of the monarchy; it was\r\nthe past,--an august spectacle,--the past, bruised with chains, branded\r\non the shoulder, ex-slave, ex-convict,--the unfortunate past, calling\r\naloud upon the future, the emancipating future! that is what that\r\nstranger was, that is what he did on that platform! At his word, which\r\nat certain moments was as the thunder, prejudices, fictions, abuses,\r\nsuperstitions, fallacies, intolerance, ignorance, fiscal infamies,\r\nbarbarous punishments, outworn authorities, worm-eaten magistracy,\r\ndiscrepit codes, rotten laws, everything that was doomed to perish,\r\ntrembled, and the downfall of those things began. That formidable\r\napparition has left a name in the memory of men; he should be called\r\nRevolution,--his name is Mirabeau!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that that man put his foot upon that platform, that\r\nplatform was transformed. The French tribune was founded.\r\n\r\nThe French tribune! A volume would be necessary to tell all that that\r\nword contains. The French tribune has been, these sixty years, the open\r\nmouth of human intelligence. Of human intelligence, saying everything,\r\ncombining everything, blending everything, fertilizing everything: the\r\ngood, the bad, the true, the false, the just, the unjust, the high, the\r\nlow, the horrible, the beautiful, dreams, facts, passion, reason, love,\r\nhate, the material, the ideal; but, in a word--for that is the essence\r\nof its sublime and eternal mission--making darkness in order to draw\r\nfrom it light, making chaos to draw from it life, making the revolution\r\nto draw from it the republic.\r\n\r\nWhat has taken place upon that tribune, what it has seen, what it has\r\ndone, what tempests have raged around it, _to_ what events it has\r\ngiven birth, what men have shaken it with their clamour, what men\r\nhave made it sacred with their truths--how recount this? After\r\nMirabeau,--Vergniaud, Camille Desmoulins, Saint-Just, that stern young\r\nman, Danton, that tremendous tribune, Robespierre, that incarnation of\r\nthe great and terrible year! From it were heard those ferocious\r\ninterruptions. \"Aha!\" cries an orator of the Convention, \"do you\r\npropose to cut short my speech?\" \"Yes,\" answers a voice, \"and your neck\r\nto-morrow.\" And those superb apostrophes. \"Minister of Justice,\" said\r\nGeneral Foy to an iniquitous Keeper of the Seals, \"I condemn you, on\r\nleaving this room, to contemplate the statue of L'Hôpital.\"--There,\r\nevery cause has been pleaded, as we have said before, bad causes as\r\nwell as good; the good only have been finally won; there, in the\r\npresence of resistance, of denials, of obstacles, those who long for\r\nthe future, like those who long for the past, have lost all patience;\r\nthere, it has happened to truth to become violent, and to falsehood to\r\nrage; there, all extremes have appeared. On that tribune the guillotine\r\nhad its orator, Marat; and the Inquisition its Montalembert. Terrorism\r\nin the name of public safety, terrorism in the name of Rome; gall in\r\nthe mouths of both, agony in the audience. When one was speaking, you\r\nfancied you saw the gleam of the knife; when the other was speaking,\r\nyou fancied you heard the crackling of the stake. There factions have\r\nfought, all with determination, a few with glory. There, the royal\r\npower violated the right of the people in the person of Manuel, become\r\nillustrious in history by this very violation; there appeared,\r\ndisdaining the past, whose servants they were, two melancholy old men:\r\nRoyer-Collard, disdainful probity, Chateaubriand, the satirical genius;\r\nthere, Thiers, skill, wrestled with Guizot, strength; there men have\r\nmingled, have grappled, have fought, have brandished evidence like a\r\nsword. There, for more than a quarter of a century, hatred, rage,\r\nsuperstition, egotism, imposture, shrieking, hissing, barking,\r\nwrithing, screaming always the same calumnies, shaking always the same\r\nclenched fist, spitting, since Christ, the same saliva, have whirled\r\nlike a cloud-storm about thy serene face, O Truth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE ORATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was alive, ardent, fruitful, tumultuous, grand. And when\r\neverything had been pleaded, argued, investigated, searched, gone to\r\nthe bottom of, said and gainsaid, what came forth from the chaos?\r\nalways the spark! What came forth from the cloud? always light! All\r\nthat the tempest could do was to agitate the ray of light, and change\r\nit into lightning. There, in that tribune, has been propounded,\r\nanalyzed, clarified, and almost always determined, every question of\r\nthe day: questions of finance, questions of credit, questions of\r\nlabour, questions of circulation, questions of salary, questions of\r\nstate, questions of the land, questions of peace, questions of war.\r\nThere, for the first time, was pronounced that phrase which contained a\r\nwhole new alignment of society,--the Rights of Man. There, for fifty\r\nyears, has been heard the ringing of the anvil upon which supernatural\r\nsmiths were forging pure ideas,--ideas, those swords of the people,\r\nthose lances of justice, that armour of law. There, suddenly\r\nimpregnated with sympathetic currents, like embers which redden in the\r\nwind, all those who had flame in their hearts, great advocates like\r\nLedru-Rollin and Berryer, great historians like Guizot, great poets\r\nlike Lamartine, rose at once, and naturally, into great orators.\r\n\r\nThat tribune was a place of strength and of virtue. It saw, it inspired\r\n(for it is easy to believe that these emanations sprang from it), all\r\nthose acts of devotion, of abnegation, of energy, of intrepidity. As\r\nfor us, we honour every display of courage, even in the ranks of those\r\nwho are opposed to us. One day the tribune was surrounded with\r\ndarkness; it seemed as if an abyss had opened around it; and in this\r\ndarkness one heard a noise like the roaring of the sea; and suddenly,\r\nin that impenetrable night, above that ledge of marble to which clung\r\nthe strong hand of Danton, one saw arise a pike bearing a bleeding\r\nhead! Boissy d'Anglas saluted it.\r\n\r\nThat was a day of menace. But the people do not overthrow tribunes. The\r\ntribunes belong to the people, and the people know it. Place a tribune\r\nin the centre of the world, and in a few days, in the four corners of\r\nthe earth, the Republic will arise. The tribune shines for the people,\r\nand they are not unaware of it. Sometimes the tribune irritates the\r\npeople, and makes them foam with rage; sometimes they beat it with\r\ntheir waves, they overflow it even, as on the 15th of May, but then\r\nthey retire majestically like the ocean, and leave it standing upright\r\nlike a beacon. To overthrow the tribune is, on the part of the people,\r\nrank folly; it is the proper work of tyrants only.\r\n\r\nThe people were rising, full of anger, of irritation. Some generous\r\nerror had seized them, some illusion was leading them astray; they had\r\nmisunderstood some act, some measure, some law; they were beginning to\r\nbe wroth, they were laying aside that superb tranquillity wherein their\r\nstrength consists, they were invading all the public squares with dull\r\nmurmurings and formidable gestures; it was an émeute, an insurrection,\r\ncivil war, a revolution, perhaps. The tribune was there. A beloved\r\nvoice arose and said to the people: \"Pause, look, listen, judge!\" _Si\r\nforte virum quem conspexere, silent._ This was true at Rome, and\r\ntrue at Paris. The people paused. O Tribune! pedestal of men of might!\r\nfrom thee have sprung eloquence, law, authority, patriotism, devotion,\r\nand great thoughts,--the curb of the people, the muzzles of lions.\r\n\r\nIn sixty years, every sort of mind, every sort of intelligence, every\r\ndescription of genius, has successively spoken in that spot, the most\r\nresonant in the world. From the first Constituent Assembly to the last,\r\nfrom the first Legislative Assembly to the last, through the\r\nConvention, the Councils, and the Chambers, count the men if you can.\r\nIt is a catalogue worthy of Homer. Follow the series! How many\r\ncontrasting figures are there from Danton to Thiers? How many figures\r\nthat resemble one another, from Barère to Baroche, from Lafayette to\r\nCavaignac? To the names we have already mentioned,--Mirabeau,\r\nVergniaud, Danton, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins, Manuel,\r\nFoy, Royer-Collard, Chateaubriand, Guizot, Thiers, Ledru-Rollin,\r\nBerryer, Lamartine,--add these other names, so different, sometimes\r\nhostile,--scholars, artists, men of science, men of the law, statesmen,\r\nwarriors, democrats, monarchists, liberals, socialists, republicans,\r\nall famous, a few illustrious, each having the halo which befits him:\r\nBarnave, Cazalès, Maury, Mounier, Thouret, Chapelier, Pétion, Buzot,\r\nBrissot, Sieyès, Condorcet, Chénier, Carnot, Lanjuinais, Pontécoulant,\r\nCambacérès, Talleyrand, Fontanes, Benjamin Constant, Casimir Perier,\r\nChauvelin, Voyer d'Argenson, Laffitte, Dupont (de l'Eure), Fitz-James,\r\nCuvier, Villemain, Camille Jordan, Lainé, Bonald, Villèle, Martignac,\r\nthe two Lameths, the two Davids (the painter in '93, the sculptor in\r\n'48), Lamarque, Mauguin, Odilon Barrot, Arago, Garnier-Pagès, Louis\r\nBlanc, Marc Dufraisse, Lamennais, Émile de Girardin, Lamoricière,\r\nDufaure, Crémieux, Michel (de Bourges), Jules Favre. What a\r\nconstellation of talents! what a variety of aptitudes! what services\r\nrendered! what a battling of all the realities against all the errors!\r\nwhat brains at work! what an outlay, for the benefit of progress, of\r\nlearning, of philosophy, of passion, of conviction, of experience, of\r\nsympathy, of eloquence! what a fertilising heat spread abroad! what a\r\nshining firmament of light!\r\n\r\nAnd we do not name them all. To make use of an expression which is\r\nsometimes borrowed from the author of this book, \"_Nous en passons et\r\ndes meilleurs_.\" We have not even alluded to that valiant legion of\r\nyoung orators who arose on the Left during these last years,--Arnauld\r\n(de l'Ariège), Bancel, Chauffour, Pascal Duprat, Esquiros, de Flotte,\r\nFarcounet, Victor Hennequin, Madier de Montjau, Morellet, Noël Parfait,\r\nPelletier, Sain, Versigny.\r\n\r\nLet us insist upon this point: starting from Mirabeau, there was in the\r\nworld, in human society, in civilization, a culminating point, a\r\ncentral spot, a common altar, a summit. This summit was the tribune of\r\nFrance; admirable landmark for coming generations, a glittering height\r\nin time of peace, a lighthouse in the darkness of catastrophes. From\r\nthe extremities of the intelligent world, the peoples fixed their eyes\r\nupon this peak, from which has shone the human mind. When dark night\r\nsuddenly enveloped them, they heard issuing from that height a mighty\r\nvoice, which spoke to them in the darkness. _Admonet et magna testatur\r\nvoce per umbras._ A voice which all at once, when the hour had come,\r\nlike the cockcrow announcing the dawn, like the cry of the eagle\r\nhailing the sun, resounded like a clarion of war, or like the trumpet\r\nof judgment, and brought to their feet once more, awe-inspiring, waving\r\ntheir winding-sheets, seeking swords in their tombs, all those heroic\r\ndead nations,--Poland, Hungary, Italy! Then, at that voice of France,\r\nthe glorious sky of the future opened; old despotisms, blinded and in\r\nfear, hid their heads in the nether darkness, and there, her feet upon\r\nthe clouds, her forehead among the stars, a sword flashing in her hand,\r\nher mighty wings outspread in the azure depths, one saw Liberty appear,\r\nthe archangel of the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF ORATORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tribune was the terror of every tyranny and fanaticism, it was the\r\nhope of every one who was oppressed under Heaven. Whoever placed his\r\nfoot upon that height, felt distinctly the pulsations of the great\r\nheart of mankind. There, providing he was a man of earnest purpose, his\r\nsoul swelled within him, and shone without. A breath of universal\r\nphilanthropy seized him, and filled his mind as the breeze fills the\r\nsail; so long as his feet rested upon those four planks, he was a\r\nstronger and a better man; he felt at that consecrated minute as if he\r\nwere living the life of all the nations; words of charity for all men\r\ncame to his lips; beyond the Assembly, grouped at his feet, and\r\nfrequently in a tumult, he beheld the people, attentive, serious, with\r\nears strained, and fingers on lips; and beyond the people, the human\r\nrace, plunged in thought, seated in circles, and listening. Such was\r\nthis grand tribune, from which a man addressed the world.\r\n\r\nFrom this tribune, incessantly vibrating, gushed forth perpetually a\r\nsort of sonorous flood, a mighty oscillation of sentiments and ideas,\r\nwhich, from billow to billow, and from people to people, flowed to the\r\nutmost confines of the earth, to set in motion those intelligent waves\r\nwhich are called souls. Frequently one knew not why such and such a\r\nlaw, such and such an institution, was tottering, beyond the frontiers,\r\nbeyond the most distant seas: the Papacy beyond the Alps, the throne of\r\nthe Czar at the extremity of Europe, slavery in America, the death\r\npenalty all over the world. The reason was that the tribune of France\r\nhad quivered. At certain hours the quiver of that tribune was an\r\nearthquake. The tribune of France spoke, and every sentient being on\r\nthis earth betook itself to reflection; the words sped into the\r\nobscurity, through space, at hazard, no matter where,--\"It is only the\r\nwind, it is only a little noise,\" said the barren minds that live upon\r\nirony; but the next day, or three months, or a year later, something\r\nfell on the surface of the earth, or something rose. What had been the\r\ncause of that? The noise that had vanished, the wind that had passed\r\naway. This noise, this wind, was \"the Word.\" A sacred force! From the\r\nWord of God came the creation of human beings;--from the Word of Man\r\nwill spring the union of the peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWHAT AN ORATOR IS\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce mounted upon this tribune, the man who was there was no longer a\r\nman: he was that mysterious workman whom we see, at twilight, walking\r\nwith long strides across the furrows, and flinging into space, with an\r\nimperial gesture, the germs, the seeds, the future harvests, the wealth\r\nof the approaching summer, bread, life.\r\n\r\nHe goes to and fro, he returns; his hand opens and empties itself,\r\nfills itself and empties itself again and again; the sombre plain is\r\nstirred, the deeps of nature open, the unknown abyss of creation begins\r\nits work; the waiting dews fall, the spear of wild grain quivers and\r\nreflects that the sheaf of wheat will succeed it; the sun, hidden\r\nbehind the horizon, loves what that workman is doing, and knows that\r\nhis rays will not be wasted. Sacred and mysterious work!\r\n\r\nThe orator is the sower. He takes from his heart his instincts, his\r\npassions, his beliefs, his sufferings, his dreams, his ideas, and\r\nthrows them, by handfuls, into the midst of men. Every brain is to him\r\nan open furrow. One word dropped from the tribune always takes root\r\nsomewhere, and becomes a thing. You say, \"Oh! it is nothing--it is a\r\nman talking,\" and you shrug your shoulders. Shortsighted creatures! it\r\nis a future which is germinating, it is a new world bursting into\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWHAT THE TRIBUNE ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo great problems hang over the world. War must disappear, and\r\nconquest must continue. These two necessities of a growing civilization\r\nseemed to exclude each other. How satisfy the one without failing the\r\nother? Who could solve the two problems at the same time? Who did solve\r\nthem? The tribune! The tribune is peace, and the tribune is conquest.\r\nConquest by the sword,--who wants it? Nobody. The peoples are\r\nfatherlands. Conquest by ideas,--who wants it? Everybody. The peoples\r\nare mankind. Now two preëminent tribunes dominated the nations--the\r\nEnglish tribune doing business, and the French tribune creating ideas.\r\nThe French tribune had elaborated after '89 all the principles which\r\nform the political philosopher's stone, and it had begun to elaborate\r\nsince 1848 all the principles which form the social philosopher's\r\nstone. When once a principle had been released from confinement and\r\nbrought into the light, the French tribune threw it upon the world,\r\narmed from head to foot, saying: \"Go!\" The victorious principle took\r\nthe field, met the custom-house officers on the frontier, and passed in\r\nspite of their watch-dogs; met the sentinels at the gates of cities,\r\nand passed despite their pass-words; travelled by railway, by\r\npacket-boat, scoured continents, crossed the seas, accosted wayfarers\r\non the highway, sat at the firesides of families, glided between friend\r\nand friend, between brother and brother, between man and wife, between\r\nmaster and slave, between people and king; and to those who asked: \"Who\r\nart thou?\" it replied: \"I am the truth;\" and to those who asked:\r\n\"Whence comest thou?\" it replied, \"I come from France.\" Then he who had\r\nquestioned the principle offered it his hand, and it was better than\r\nthe annexation of a province, it was the annexation of a human mind.\r\nThenceforth, between Paris, the metropolis, and that man in his\r\nsolitude, and that town buried in the heart of the woods or of the\r\nsteppes, and that people groaning under the yoke, a current of thought\r\nand of love was established. Under the influence of these currents\r\ncertain nationalities grew weak, whilst others waxed strong and rose\r\nagain. The savage felt himself less savage, the Turk less Turk, the\r\nRussian less Russian, the Hungarian more Hungarian, the Italian more\r\nItalian. Slowly, and by degrees, the French spirit assimilated the\r\nother nations, for universal progress. Thanks to this admirable French\r\nlanguage, composed by Providence, with wonderful equilibrium, of enough\r\nconsonants to be pronounced by the nations of the North, and of enough\r\nvowels to be pronounced by the peoples of the South; thanks to this\r\nlanguage, which is a power of civilization and of humanity, little by\r\nlittle, and by its radiation alone, this lofty central tribune of Paris\r\nconquered the nations and made them France. The material boundary of\r\nFrance was such as she could make it; but there were no treaties of\r\n1815 to determine her moral frontier. The moral frontier constantly\r\nreceded and broadened from day to day; and before a quarter of a\r\ncentury, perhaps, one would have said the French world, as one said the\r\nRoman world.\r\n\r\nThat is what the tribune was, that is what it was accomplishing for\r\nFrance, a prodigious engine of ideas, a gigantic factory ever elevating\r\nthe level of intelligence all over the world, and infusing into the\r\nheart of humanity a vast flood of light.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what M. Bonaparte has suppressed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARISM\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, that tribune M. Bonaparte has overthrown. That power, created by\r\nour revolutionary parturition, he has broken, shattered, crushed, torn\r\nwith his bayonets, thrown under the feet of horses. His uncle uttered\r\nan aphorism: \"The throne is a board covered with velvet.\" He, also, has\r\nuttered his: \"The tribune is a board covered with cloth, on which we\r\nread, _Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité_.\" He has thrown board and cloth,\r\nand Liberty and Equality and Fraternity, into the fire of a bivouac. A\r\nburst of laughter from the soldiers, a little smoke, and all was over.\r\n\r\nIs it true? Is it possible? Did it happen so? Has such a thing been\r\nseen in these days? Mon Dieu, yes; it is, in fact, extremely simple. To\r\ncut off the head of Cicero and nail his two hands upon the rostrum, it\r\nsufficed to have a brute who has a knife, and another brute who has\r\nnails and a hammer.\r\n\r\nThe tribune was for France three things: a means of exterior\r\ninitiative, a method of interior government, a source of glory. Louis\r\nBonaparte has suppressed the initiative. France was the teacher of the\r\npeoples, and conquered them by love; to what end? He has suppressed the\r\nmethod of government,--his own is better. He has breathed upon the\r\nglory of France, and blown it out. Certain breaths have this property.\r\n\r\nBut to make an assault upon the tribune is a family crime. The first\r\nBonaparte had already committed it, but at least what he brought into\r\nFrance to replace that glory, was glory, not ignominy.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte did not content himself with overthrowing the tribune;\r\nhe determined to make it ridiculous. As well try that as anything else.\r\nThe least one can do, when one cannot utter two words consecutively,\r\nwhen one harangues only with written notes in hand, when one is short\r\nboth of speech and of intelligence, is to make a little fun of\r\nMirabeau. General Ratapoil said to General Foy, \"Hold your tongue,\r\nchatterbox!\"--\"What is it you call the tribune?\" cries M. Bonaparte\r\nLouis; \"it is parliamentarism!\" What have you to say to\r\n\"parliamentarism\"? Parliamentarism pleases me. Parliamentarism is a\r\npearl. Behold the dictionary enriched. This academician of _coups\r\nd'état_ makes new words. In truth one is not a barbarian to refrain\r\nfrom dropping a barbarism now and then. He too is a sower; barbarisms\r\nfructify in the brains of idiots. The uncle had \"ideologists\"--the\r\nnephew has \"parliamentarisms.\" Parliamentarism, gentlemen;\r\nparliamentarism, ladies. This is answerable for everything. You venture\r\ntimidly to observe: \"It is perhaps a pity so many families have been\r\nruined, so many people transported, so many citizens proscribed, so\r\nmany coffins filled, so many graves dug, so much blood spilt\" \"Aha!\"\r\nreplies a coarse voice with a Dutch accent; \"so you mistrust\r\nparliamentarism, do you?\" Get out of the dilemma if you can.\r\nParliamentarism is a great find. I give my vote to M. Louis Bonaparte\r\nfor the next vacant seat at the Institute. What's that? why, we must\r\nencourage neology! This man comes from the dung-heap, this man comes\r\nfrom the Morgue, this man's hands steam like a butcher's, he scratches\r\nhis ear, smiles, and invents words like Julie d'Angennes. He marries\r\nthe wit of the Hôtel de Rambouillet to the odour of Montfauçon. We will\r\nboth vote for him, won't we, M. de Montalembert?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUNE DESTROYED\r\n\r\n\r\nSo \"parliamentarism\"--that is to say, protection of the citizen,\r\nfreedom of discussion, liberty of the press, liberty of the subject,\r\nsupervision of the taxes, inspection of the receipts and expenses, the\r\nsafety-lock upon the public money-box, the right of knowing what is\r\nbeing done with your money, the solidity of credit, liberty of\r\nconscience, liberty of worship, protection of property, the guarantee\r\nagainst confiscation and spoliation, the safeguard of the individual,\r\nthe counterpoise to arbitrary power, the dignity of the nation, the\r\nglory of France, the steadfast morals of free nations, movement,\r\nlife,--all these exist no longer. Wiped out, annihilated, vanished! And\r\nthis \"deliverance\" has cost France only the trifle of twenty-five\r\nmillions, divided amongst twelve or fifteen saviours, and forty\r\nthousand francs in eau-de-vie, per brigade! Verily, this is not dear!\r\nthese gentlemen, of the _coup d'état_ did the thing at a discount.\r\n\r\nNow the deed is done, it is complete. The grass is growing at the\r\nPalais-Bourbon. A virgin forest is beginning to spring up between Pont\r\nde la Concorde and Place Bourgogne. Amid the underbrush one\r\ndistinguishes the box of a sentry. The Corps Législatif empties its urn\r\namong the reeds, and the water flows around the foot of the sentry-box\r\nwith a gentle murmur.\r\n\r\nNow it is all over. The great work is accomplished. And the results of\r\nthe work! Do you know that Messieurs So-and-So won town houses and\r\ncountry houses in the Circuit Railway alone? Get all you can, gorge\r\nyourselves, grow a fat paunch; it is no longer a question of being a\r\ngreat people, of being a powerful people, of being a free nation, of\r\ncasting a bright light; France no longer sees its way to that. And this\r\nis success! France votes for Louis-Napoleon, carries Louis-Napoleon,\r\nfattens Louis-Napoleon, contemplates Louis-Napoleon, admires\r\nLouis-Napoleon, and is stupefied. The end of civilization is attained!\r\n\r\nNow there is no more noise, no more confusion, no more talking, no more\r\nparliament, or parliamentarism. The Corps Législatif, the Senate, the\r\nCouncil of State, have all had their mouths sewn up. There is no more\r\nfear of reading a fine speech when you wake up in the morning. It is\r\nall over with everything that thought, that meditated, that created,\r\nthat spoke, that sparkled, that shone among this great people. Be\r\nproud, Frenchmen! Lift high your heads, Frenchmen! You are no longer\r\nanything, and this man is everything! He holds in his hand your\r\nintelligence, as a child holds a bird. Any day he pleases, he can\r\nstrangle the genius of France. That will be one less source of tumult!\r\nIn the meantime, let us repeat in chorus: \"No more Parliamentarism, no\r\nmore tribune!\" In lieu of all those great voices which debated for the\r\nimprovement of mankind, which were, one the idea, another the fact,\r\nanother the right, another justice, another glory, another faith,\r\nanother hope, another learning, another genius; which instructed, which\r\ncharmed, which comforted, which encouraged, which brought forth fruit;\r\nin lieu of all those sublime voices, what is it that one hears amid the\r\ndark night that hangs like a pall over France? The jingle of a spur, of\r\na sword dragged along the pavement!\r\n\r\n\"Hallelujah!\" says M. Sibour. \"Hosannah!\" replies M. Parisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nTHE ABSOLUTION:--FIRST PHASE: THE 7,500,000 VOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE ABSOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one says to us: \"You do not consider! All these facts, which you\r\ncall crimes, are henceforth 'accomplished facts,' and consequently to\r\nbe respected; it is all accepted, adopted, legitimized, absolved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accepted! adopted! legitimized! absolved! by what?\"\r\n\r\n\"By a vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"What vote?\"\r\n\r\n\"The seven million five hundred thousand votes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! true. There was a plebiscite, and a vote, and seven million five\r\nhundred thousand ayes. Let us say a word of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE DILIGENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nA brigand stops a diligence in the woods.\r\n\r\nHe is at the head of a resolute band.\r\n\r\nThe travellers are more numerous, but they are separated, disunited,\r\ncooped up in the different compartments, half asleep, surprised in the\r\nmiddle of the night, seized unexpectedly and without arms.\r\n\r\nThe brigand orders them to alight, not to utter a cry, not to speak a\r\nword, and to lie down with their faces to the ground.\r\n\r\nSome resist: he blows out their brains.\r\n\r\nThe rest obey, and lie on the road, speechless, motionless, terrified,\r\nmixed up with the dead bodies, and half dead themselves.\r\n\r\nThe brigand, while his accomplices keep their feet on the ribs of the\r\ntravellers, and their pistols at their heads, rifles their pockets,\r\nforces open their trunks, and takes all the valuables they possess.\r\n\r\nThe pockets rifled, the trunks pillaged, the _coup d'état_ completed,\r\nhe says to them:--\r\n\r\n\"Now, in order to set myself right with justice, I have written down on\r\npaper a declaration, that you acknowledge that all I have taken\r\nbelonged to me, and that you give it to me of your own free will. I\r\npropose that this shall be your view of the matter. Each of you will\r\nhave a pen given you, and without uttering a syllable, without making\r\nthe slightest movement, without quitting your present attitude\" (belly\r\non ground, and face in the mud) \"you will put out your arms, and you\r\nwill all sign this paper. If any one of you moves or speaks, here is\r\nthe muzzle of my pistol. Otherwise, you are quite free.\"\r\n\r\nThe travellers put out their arms, and sign.\r\n\r\nThe brigand thereupon tosses his head, and says:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seven million five hundred thousand votes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSCRUTINY OF THE VOTE.--A REMINDER OF PRINCIPLES.--FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Louis Bonaparte is president of this diligence. Let us recall a few\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nFor a political ballot to be valid, three absolute conditions must\r\nexist: First, the vote must be free; second, the vote must be\r\nintelligent; third, the figures must be accurate. If one of these three\r\nconditions is wanting, the ballot is null. How is it when all three are\r\nwanting?\r\n\r\nLet us apply these rules.\r\n\r\nFirst. _That the vote must be free._\r\n\r\nWhat freedom there was in the vote of the 20th of December, we have\r\njust pointed out; we have described that freedom by a striking display\r\nof evidence. We might dispense with adding anything to it. Let each of\r\nthose who voted reflect, and ask himself under what moral and physical\r\nviolence he dropped his ballot in the box. We might cite a certain\r\ncommune of the Yonne, where, of five hundred heads of families, four\r\nhundred and thirty were arrested, and the rest voted \"aye;\" or a\r\ncommune of the Loiret, where, of six hundred and thirty-nine heads of\r\nfamilies, four hundred and ninety-seven were arrested or banished; the\r\none hundred and forty-two who escaped voted \"aye.\" What we say of the\r\nLoiret and the Yonne might be said of all the departments. Since the\r\n2nd of December, each town has its swarm of spies; each village, each\r\nhamlet, its informer. To vote \"no\" was imprisonment, transportation,\r\nLambessa. In the villages of one department, we were told by an\r\neye-witness, they brought \"ass-loads of 'aye' ballots.\" The mayors,\r\nflanked by gardes-champêtres, distributed them among the peasants. They\r\nhad no choice but to vote. At Savigny, near Saint-Maur, on the morning\r\nof the vote, some enthusiastic gendarmes declared that the man who\r\nvoted \"no\" should not sleep in his bed. The gendarmerie cast into the\r\nhouse of detention at Valenciennes M. Parent the younger, deputy\r\njustice of the peace of the canton of Bouchain, for having advised\r\ncertain inhabitants of Avesne-le-Sec to vote \"no.\" The nephew of\r\nRepresentative Aubry (du Nord), having seen the agents of the prefect\r\ndistribute \"aye\" ballots in the great square of Lille, went into the\r\nsquare next morning, and distributed \"no\" ballots. He was arrested and\r\nconfined in the citadel.\r\n\r\nAs to the vote of the army, a part of it voted in its own cause; the\r\nrest followed.\r\n\r\nBut even as to the freedom of this vote of the soldiers, let us hear\r\nthe army speak for itself. This is what is written by a soldier of the\r\n6th Regiment of the Line, commanded by Colonel Garderens de Boisse:--\r\n\r\n\"So far as our company was concerned, the vote was a roll-call. The\r\nsubaltern officers, the corporals, the drummers, and the soldiers,\r\narranged in order of rank, were named by the quartermaster in presence\r\nof the colonel, the lieutenant-colonel, the major, and the company\r\nofficers; and as each man named answered, 'Here!' his name was\r\ninscribed by the sergeant-major. The colonel, rubbing his hands, was\r\nsaying, 'Egad, gentlemen, this is going on wheels!' when a corporal of\r\nthe company to which I belong approached the table at which the\r\nsergeant-major was seated, and requested him to let him have the pen,\r\nthat he might himself inscribe his name on the 'no' register, which was\r\nintended to remain blank.\r\n\r\n\"'What!' cried the colonel; 'you, who are down for quartermaster, and\r\nwho are to be appointed on the first vacancy,--you formally disobey\r\nyour colonel, and that in the presence of your company! It would be bad\r\nenough if this refusal of yours were simply an act of insubordination,\r\nbut know you not, wretched man, that by your vote you seek to bring\r\nabout the destruction of the army, the burning of your father's house,\r\nthe annihilation of all society! You hold out your hand to debauchery!\r\nWhat! X----, you, whom I intended to urge for promotion, you come here\r\nto-day and admit all this?'\r\n\r\n\"The poor devil, it may be imagined, allowed his name to be inscribed\r\nwith the rest.\"\r\n\r\nMultiply this colonel by six hundred thousand, and the product is the\r\npressure of the functionaries of all sorts--military, political, civil,\r\nadministrative, ecclesiastical, judicial, fiscal, municipal,\r\nscholastic, commercial, and consular--throughout France, on the\r\nsoldier, the citizen, and the peasant. Add, as we have above pointed\r\nout, the fictitious communist Jacquerie and the real Bonapartist\r\nterrorism, the government imposing by phantasmagoria on the weak, and\r\nby dictatorship on the refractory, and brandishing two terrors\r\ntogether. It would require a special volume to relate, expose, and\r\ndevelop the innumerable details of that immense extortion of\r\nsignatures, which is called \"the vote of the 20th of December.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote of the 20th of December prostrated the honour, the initiative,\r\nthe intelligence, and the moral life of the nation. France went to that\r\nvote as sheep go to the slaughter-house.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed.\r\n\r\nSecond. _That the vote must be intelligent._\r\n\r\nHere is an elementary proposition. Where there is no liberty of the\r\npress, there is no vote. The liberty of the press is the condition\r\n_sine quâ non_, of universal suffrage. Every ballot cast in the absence\r\nof liberty of the press is void _ab initio_. Liberty of the press\r\ninvolves, as necessary corollaries, liberty of meeting, liberty of\r\npublishing, liberty of distributing information, all the liberties\r\nengendered by the right--antedating all other rights--of informing\r\none's self before voting. To vote is to steer; to vote is to judge. Can\r\none imagine a blind pilot at the helm? Can one imagine a judge with his\r\nears stuffed and his eyes put out? Liberty, then,--liberty to inform\r\none's self by every means, by inquiry, by the press, by speech, by\r\ndiscussion,--this is the express guarantee, the condition of being, of\r\nuniversal suffrage. In order that a thing may be done validly, it must\r\nbe done knowingly. Where there is no torch, there is no binding act.\r\n\r\nThese are axioms: outside of these axioms, all is _ipso facto_ null.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see: did M. Bonaparte, in his ballot of the 20th of\r\nDecember, obey these axioms? Did he fulfil the conditions of free\r\npress, free meetings, free tribune, free advertising, free inquiry. The\r\nanswer is an immense shout of laughter, even from the Élysée.\r\n\r\nThus you are yourself compelled to admit that it was thus that\r\n\"universal suffrage\" was exercised.\r\n\r\nWhat! I know nothing of what is going on: men have been killed,\r\nslaughtered, murdered, massacred, and I am ignorant of it! Men have\r\nbeen arbitrarily imprisoned, tortured, banished, exiled, transported,\r\nand I scarcely glimpse the fact! My mayor and my curé tell me: \"These\r\npeople, who are taken away, bound with cords, are escaped convicts!\" I\r\nam a peasant, cultivating a patch of land in a corner of one of the\r\nprovinces: you suppress the newspaper, you stifle information, you\r\nprevent the truth from reaching me, and then you make me vote! in the\r\nuttermost darkness of night! gropingly! What! you rush out upon me from\r\nthe obscurity, sabre in hand, and you say to me: \"Vote!\" and you call\r\nthat a ballot.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! a 'free and spontaneous' ballot,\" say the organs of the\r\n_coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nEvery sort of machinery was set to work at this vote. One village\r\nmayor, a species of wild Escobar, growing in the fields, said to his\r\npeasants: \"If you vote 'aye,' 'tis for the Republic; if you vote 'no,'\r\n'tis against the Republic.\" The peasants voted \"aye.\"\r\n\r\nAnd let us illuminate another aspect of this turpitude that people call\r\n\"the plebiscite of the 20th of December.\" How was the question put? Was\r\nany choice possible? Did he--and it was the least that a _coup d'état_\r\nman should have done in so strange a ballot as that wherein he put\r\neverything at stake--did he open to each party the door at which its\r\nprinciples could enter? were the Legitimists allowed to turn towards\r\ntheir exiled prince, and towards the ancient honour of the\r\n_fleurs-de-lys_? were the Orleanists allowed to turn towards that\r\nproscribed family, honoured by the valued services of two soldiers, M\r\nM. de Joinville and d'Aumale, and made illustrious by that exalted\r\nsoul, Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans? Did he offer to the people--who are\r\nnot a party, but the people, that is to say, the sovereign--did he\r\noffer to the people that true republic before which all monarchy\r\nvanishes, as night before day; that republic which is the manifest and\r\nirresistible future of the civilized world; the republic without\r\ndictatorship; the republic of concord, of learning, and of liberty; the\r\nrepublic of universal suffrage, of universal peace, and of universal\r\nwell-being; the republic, initiator of peoples, and liberator of\r\nnationalities; that republic which after all and whatever any one may\r\ndo, \"will,\" as the author of this book has said elsewhere,[1] \"possess\r\nFrance to-morrow, and Europe the day after.\" Did he offer that? No.\r\nThis is how M. Bonaparte put the matter: there were in this ballot two\r\ncandidates; first candidate, M. Bonaparte; second candidate--the abyss.\r\nFrance had the choice. Admire the adroitness of the man, and, not a\r\nlittle, his humility. M. Bonaparte took for his opponent in this\r\ncontest, whom? M. de Chambord? No! M. de Joinville? No! The Republic?\r\nStill less. M. Bonaparte, like those pretty Creoles who show off their\r\nbeauty by juxtaposition with some frightful Hottentot, took as his\r\ncompetitor in this election a phantom, a vision, a socialistic monster\r\nof Nuremberg, with long teeth and talons, and a live coal in its eyes,\r\nthe ogre of Tom Thumb, the vampire of Porte Saint-Martin, the hydra of\r\nTheramenes, the great sea-serpent of the _Constitutionnel_, which the\r\nshareholders have had the kindness to impute to it, the dragon of the\r\nApocalypse, the Tarask, the Drée, the Gra-ouili, a scarecrow. Aided by\r\na Ruggieri of his own, M. Bonaparte lit up this pasteboard monster with\r\nred Bengal fire, and said to the scared voter: \"There is no possible\r\nchoice except this or myself: choose!\" He said: \"Choose between beauty\r\nand the beast; the beast is communism; the beauty is my dictatorship.\r\nChoose! There is no medium! Society prostrate, your house burned, your\r\nbarn pillaged, your cow stolen, your fields confiscated, your wife\r\noutraged, your children murdered, your wine drunk by others, yourself\r\ndevoured alive by the great gaping-jaws yonder, or me as your emperor!\r\nChoose! Me or Croque-mitaine!\"\r\n\r\n      [1] _Littérature et Philosophie Mêlées 1830._\r\n\r\nThe citizen, affrighted, and consequently a child; the peasant,\r\nignorant, and consequently a child, preferred M. Bonaparte to\r\nCroque-mitaine. Such is his triumph!\r\n\r\nObserve, however, that of ten millions of voters, five hundred thousand\r\nwould, it seems, have preferred Croque-mitaine.\r\n\r\nAfter all, M. Bonaparte only had seven million five hundred thousand\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThus, then, and in this fashion,--freely as we see, knowingly as we\r\nsee,--that which M. Bonaparte is good enough to call universal\r\nsuffrage, voted. Voted what?\r\n\r\nDictatorship, autocracy, slavery, the republic a despotism, France a\r\npachalik, chains on all wrists, a seal on every mouth, silence,\r\ndegradation, fear, the spy the soul of all things! They have given to a\r\nman--to you!--omnipotence and omniscience! They have made that man the\r\nsupreme, the only legislator, the alpha of the law, the omega of power!\r\nThey have decreed that he is Minos, that he is Numa, that he is Solon,\r\nthat he is Lycurgus! They have incarnated in him the people, the\r\nnation, the state, the law! and for ten years! What! I, a citizen,\r\nvote, not only for my own dispossession, my own forfeiture, my own\r\nabdication, but for the abdication of universal suffrage for ten years,\r\nby the coming generations, over whom I have no right, over whom you, an\r\nusurper, force me to usurp power, which, by the way, be it said in\r\npassing, would suffice to nullify that monstrous ballot, if all\r\nconceivable nullities were not already piled, heaped and welded upon\r\nit. What! is that what you would have me do? You make me vote that all\r\nis finished, that nothing remains, that the people is a slave! What!\r\nyou say to me: \"Since you are sovereign, you shall give yourself a\r\nmaster; since you are France, you shall become Haiti!\" What an\r\nabominable farce!\r\n\r\nSuch is the vote of the 20th of December,--that sanction, as M. de\r\nMorny says; that absolution, as M. Bonaparte says.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, a short time hence,--in a year, in a month, perhaps in a\r\nweek,--when all that we now see has vanished, men will be ashamed of\r\nhaving, if only for an instant, bestowed upon that infamous semblance\r\nof a ballot, which they call the ballot of seven million five hundred\r\nthousand votes, the honour of discussing it. Yet it is the only basis,\r\nthe only support, the only rampart of this prodigious power of M.\r\nBonaparte. This vote is the excuse of cowards, this vote is the buckler\r\nof dishonoured consciences. Generals, magistrates, bishops, all crimes,\r\nall prevarications, all degrees of complicity, seek refuge for their\r\nignominy behind this vote. France has spoken, say they: _vox populi,\r\nvox Dei_, universal suffrage has voted; everything is covered by a\r\nballot.--_That_ a vote! _that_ a ballot? One spits on it, and passes\r\nby.\r\n\r\nThird. _The figures must be accurate._ I admire that figure: 7,500,000!\r\nIt must have had a fine effect, through the fog of the 1st of January,\r\nin letters of gold, three feet high, on the portal of Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\nI admire that figure. Do you know why? Because I consider it humble.\r\nSeven million five hundred thousand. Why seven million five hundred\r\nthousand? It is not many. No one refused M. Bonaparte full measure.\r\nAfter what he had done on the 2nd of December, he was entitled to\r\nsomething better than that. Tell us, who played him that trick? Who\r\nprevented him from putting down eight millions, or ten millions,--a\r\ngood round sum? As for myself, I was quite disappointed in my hopes. I\r\ncounted on unanimity. _Coup d'état_, you are indeed modest!\r\n\r\nHow now! a man has done all we have recalled or related: has taken an\r\noath and perjured himself; was the guardian of a constitution and\r\ndestroyed it, was the servant of a republic and betrayed it, was the\r\nagent of a sovereign assembly and violently crushed it; used the\r\nmilitary pass-word as a poignard to kill military honour, used the\r\nstandard of France to wipe away mud and shame, put handcuffs on the\r\ngenerals of Africa, made the representatives of the people travel in\r\nprison-vans, filled Mazas, Vincennes, Mont Valérien, and Sainte-Pélagie\r\nwith inviolable men, shot down point-blank, on the barricade of the\r\nlaw, the legislator girt with that scarf which is the sacred and\r\nvenerable symbol of the law; gave to a colonel, whom we could name, a\r\nhundred thousand francs to trample duty under foot, and to each soldier\r\nten francs a day; distributed in four days forty thousand francs' worth\r\nof brandy to each brigade; covered with the gold of the Bank the\r\ncard-tables of the Élysée, and said to his friends, \"Help yourselves!\"\r\nkilled M. Adde in his own house, M. Belval in his own house, M.\r\nDebaecque in his own house, M. Labilte in his own house, M. de\r\nCouvercelle in his own house, M. Monpelas in his own house, M. Thirion\r\nde Mortauban in his own house; massacred on the boulevards and\r\nelsewhere, shot anybody anywhere, committed numerous murders, of which\r\nhe modestly confesses to only one hundred and ninety-one; changed the\r\ntrenches about the trees on the boulevards into pools of blood; spilt\r\nthe blood of the infant with the blood of the mother, mingling with\r\nboth the champagne of the gendarmes!--a man has done all these things,\r\nhas taken all this trouble; and when he asks the nation: \"Are you\r\nsatisfied?\" he obtains only seven million five hundred thousand\r\nvoters!--Really, he is underpaid.\r\n\r\nSacrifice one's self \"to save society,\" indeed! O, ingratitude of\r\nnations!\r\n\r\nIn truth, three millions of voices replied \"_No_.\" Who was it, pray,\r\nwho said that the South Sea savages call the French the \"_oui-ouis_?\"\r\n\r\nLet us speak seriously. For irony is painful in such tragic matters.\r\n\r\n_Coup d'état_ men, nobody believes in your seven million five hundred\r\nthousand votes.\r\n\r\nCome, be frank, and confess that you are more or less swindlers, that\r\nyou cheat a little. In your balance-sheet of the 2nd of December you\r\nset down too many votes,--and not enough corpses.\r\n\r\nSeven million five hundred thousand! What figure is that? Whence comes\r\nit? What do you want us to do with it?\r\n\r\nSeven million, eight million, ten million, what does it matter? We\r\nconcede you everything, and we contest everything with you.\r\n\r\nThe seven million you have, plus the five hundred thousand; the round\r\nsum, plus the odd money; you say so, prince, you affirm it, you swear\r\nit; but what proves it?\r\n\r\nWho counted? Baroche. Who examined? Rouher. Who checked? Piétri. Who\r\nadded? Maupas. Who certified? Troplong. Who made the proclamation?\r\nYourself!\r\n\r\nIn other words, servility counted, platitude examined, trickery\r\nchecked, forgery added, venality certified, and mendacity proclaimed.\r\n\r\nVery good.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, M. Bonaparte ascends to the Capitol, orders M. Sibour to\r\nthank Jupiter, puts a blue and gold livery on the Senate, a blue and\r\nsilver livery on the Corps Législatif, and a green and gold livery on\r\nhis coachman; lays his hand on his heart, declares that he is the\r\nproduct of \"universal suffrage,\" and that his \"legitimacy\" has issued\r\nfrom the ballot-box. That box is a wine-cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWHO REALLY VOTED FOR M. BONAPARTE?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe declare therefore, we declare simply this, that on the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1851, eighteen days after the 2nd, M. Bonaparte put his hand\r\ninto every man's conscience, and robbed every man of his vote. Others\r\nfilch handkerchiefs, he steals an Empire. Every day, for pranks of the\r\nsame sort, a _sergent-de-ville_ takes a man by the collar and carries\r\nhim off to the police-station.\r\n\r\nLet us be understood, however.\r\n\r\nDo we mean to declare that nobody really voted for M. Bonaparte? That\r\nno one voluntarily said \"Aye?\" That no one knowingly and willingly\r\naccepted that man?\r\n\r\nBy no means.\r\n\r\nM. Bonaparte had for him the crowd of officeholders, the one million\r\ntwo hundred thousand parasites of the budget, and their dependents and\r\nhangers-on; the corrupt, the compromised, the adroit; and in their\r\ntrain the _crétins_, a very considerable party.\r\n\r\nHe had for him Messieurs the Cardinals, Messieurs the Bishops,\r\nMessieurs the Canons, Messieurs the Curés, Messieurs the Vicars,\r\nMessieurs the Arch-deacons, Deacons, and Sub-deacons, Messieurs the\r\nPrebendaries, Messieurs the Churchwardens, Messieurs the Sextons,\r\nMessieurs the Beadles, Messieurs the Church-door-openers, and the\r\n\"religious\" men, as they say. Yes, we admit, without hesitation, M.\r\nBonaparte had for him all those bishops who cross themselves like\r\nVeuillot and Montalembert, and all those religious men, a priceless,\r\nancient race, but largely increased and recruited since the landholders'\r\nterrors of 1848, who pray in this wise: \"O, my God! send up the Lyons\r\nshares! Dear Lord Jesus, see to it that I make a profit of twenty-five\r\nper cent, on my Rothschild-Neapolitan bonds! Holy Apostles, sell my\r\nwines for me! Blessed Martyrs, double my rents! Holy Mary, Mother of\r\nGod, immaculate Virgin, Star of the Sea, Enclosed Garden, _Hortus\r\nConclusus_, deign to cast a favouring eye on my little business at the\r\ncorner of Rue Tire-chape and Rue Quincampoix! Tower of Ivory, cause the\r\nshop over the way to lose trade!\"\r\n\r\nThese really and incontestably voted for M. Bonaparte: first category,\r\nthe office-holder; second category, the idiot; third category, the\r\nreligious Voltairian--land-owner--tradesman.\r\n\r\nThe human understanding in general, and the bourgeois intellect in\r\nparticular, present singular enigmas. We know, and we have no desire to\r\nconceal it, that from the shopkeeper up to the banker, from the petty\r\ntrader up to the stockbroker, great numbers of the commercial and\r\nindustrial men of France,--that is to say, great numbers of the men who\r\nknow what well-placed confidence is, what a trust faithfully\r\nadministered is, what a key placed in safe hands is,--voted after the\r\n2nd of December for M. Bonaparte. The vote given, you might have\r\naccosted one of these men of business, the first you met by chance; and\r\nthis is the dialogue that you might have exchanged with him:\r\n\r\n'You have elected Louis Bonaparte President of the Republic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you engage him as your cashier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCONCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is the ballot,--let us repeat it--insist on it--never be tired\r\nof uttering it; \"I cry the same things a hundred times,\" says Isaiah,\r\n\"so that they may be heard once;\" this is the ballot, this is the\r\nplebiscite, this is the vote, this is the sovereign decree of\r\n\"Universal Suffrage,\" beneath whose shadow take shelter--of which they\r\nmake a patent of authority, a diploma of government--those men who now\r\nhold France, who command, who dominate, who administer, who judge, who\r\nreign: their arms in gold up to the elbows, their legs in blood up to\r\nthe knees!\r\n\r\nAnd now, to have done with it, let us make a concession to M.\r\nBonaparte. No more quibbling. His ballot of the 20th of December was\r\nfree; it was intelligent; all the newspapers printed whatever they\r\npleased; he who says the contrary is a slanderer; electoral meetings\r\nwere held; the walls were hidden beneath placards; the promenaders in\r\nParis swept with their feet, on the boulevards and on the streets, a\r\nsnow of ballots, white, blue, yellow, red; everybody spoke who chose,\r\nwrote who chose; the figures were accurate; it was not Baroche who\r\ncounted, it was Barême; Louis Blanc, Guinard, Félix Pyat, Raspail,\r\nCaussidière, Thorné, Ledru-Rollin, Etienne Arago, Albert, Barbès,\r\nBlanqui, and Gent, were the inspectors; it was they themselves who\r\nannounced the seven million five hundred thousand votes. Be it so. We\r\nconcede all that. What then? What conclusion does the _coup d'état_\r\nthence derive?\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion? It rubs its hands, it asks nothing further; that is\r\nquite sufficient; it concludes that all is right, all complete, all\r\nfinished, that nothing more is to be said, that it is \"absolved.\"\r\n\r\nStop, there!\r\n\r\nThe free vote, the actual figures--these are only the physical side of\r\nthe question; the moral side remains to be considered. Ah! there is a\r\nmoral side, then? Undoubtedly, prince, and that is precisely the true\r\nside, the important side of this question of the 2nd of December. Let\r\nus look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE MORAL SIDE OF THE QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, M. Bonaparte, it is expedient that you should acquire a notion\r\nwhat the human conscience is.\r\n\r\nThere are two things in this world--learn this novelty--which men call\r\ngood and evil. You must be informed that lying is not good, treachery\r\nis evil, assassination is worse. It makes no difference that it is\r\nuseful, it is prohibited. \"By whom?\" you will add. We will explain that\r\npoint to you, a little farther on; but let us proceed. Man--you must\r\nalso be informed--is a thinking being, free in this world, responsible\r\nin the next. Singularly enough--and you will be surprised to hear\r\nit--he is not created merely to enjoy himself, to indulge all his\r\nfancies, to follow the hazard of his appetites, to crush whatever he\r\nfinds before him in his path, blade of grass or plighted oath, to\r\ndevour whatever presents itself when he is hungry. Life is not his\r\nprey. For example, to pass from nothing a year to twelve hundred\r\nthousand francs, it is not permitted to take an oath which one has no\r\nintention to keep; and, to pass from twelve hundred thousand francs to\r\ntwelve millions, it is not permitted to crush the constitution and laws\r\nof one's country, to rush from an ambuscade upon a sovereign assembly,\r\nto bombard Paris, to transport ten thousand persons, and to proscribe\r\nforty thousand. I continue your initiation into this singular mystery.\r\nCertes, it is agreeable to give one's lackeys white silk stockings;\r\nbut, to arrive at this grand result, it is not permitted to suppress\r\nthe glory and the thought of a people, to overthrow the central tribune\r\nof the civilized world, to shackle the progress of mankind, and to shed\r\ntorrents of blood. That is forbidden. \"By whom?\" you repeat, who see\r\nbefore you no one who forbids you anything. Patience: you shall know\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nWhat!--here you begin to be disgusted, and I can understand it--when\r\none has, on the one hand, one's interest, one's ambition, one's\r\nfortune, one's pleasures, a fine palace to maintain in Faubourg\r\nSaint-Honoré; and, on the other side, the jeremiads and whining of\r\nwomen from whom one takes their sons, of families from whom one tears\r\ntheir fathers, of children from whom one takes their bread, of the\r\npeople whose liberty one confiscates, of society from whom one takes\r\nits support, the laws; what! when these clamours are on one side and\r\none's own interest on the other, is it not permitted to contemn the\r\nuproar, to let all these people \"vociferate\" unheeded, to trample on\r\nall obstacles, and to go naturally where one sees one's fortune, one's\r\npleasures, and the fine palace in Faubourg Saint-Honoré? A pretty idea,\r\ntruly! What! one is to trouble one's self to remember that, some three\r\nor four years ago, one cannot now say when or where, one day in\r\nDecember, when it was very cold, and rained, and one felt it desirable\r\nto leave a chamber in an inn for a better lodging, one pronounced, one\r\nno longer knows in relation to what, in an indifferently lighted room,\r\nbefore eight or nine hundred imbeciles who chose to believe what one\r\nsaid, these eight letters, \"I swear it!\" What! when one is meditating\r\n\"a great act,\" one must needs waste one's time asking one's self what\r\nwill be the result of the course that he is taking! must worry because\r\none man may be eaten up by vermin in the casemates, or another rot in\r\nthe hulks, or another die at Cayenne; or because another was killed\r\nwith bayonets, or another crushed by paving-stones, or another idiot\r\nenough to get himself shot; because these are ruined, and those exiled;\r\nand because all these men whom one ruins, or shoots, or exiles, or\r\nmassacres, who rot in the hulks, or die in the hold, or in Africa, are,\r\nforsooth, honest men who have done their duty! Is one to be stopped by\r\nsuch stuff as that? What! one has necessities, one has no money, one is\r\na prince, chance places power in one's hands, one makes use of it, one\r\nauthorizes lotteries, one exhibits ingots of gold in the Passage\r\nJouffroy; everybody opens his pocket, one takes all one can out of it,\r\none shares what one gets with one's friends, with the devoted comrades\r\nto whom one owes gratitude; and because there comes a moment when\r\npublic indiscretion meddles in the matter, when that infamous liberty\r\nof the press seeks to fathom the mystery, and justice fancies that it\r\nis its business, one must needs leave the Éysée, lay down the power,\r\nand take one's seat, like an ass, between two gendarmes on the\r\nprisoners' bench in the sixth chamber! Nonsense! Isn't it much more\r\nsimple to take one's seat on the throne of the emperor? Isn't it much\r\nmore simple to destroy the liberty of the press? Isn't it much more\r\nsimple to crush justice? Isn't it a much shorter way to trample the\r\njudges under foot? Indeed, they ask nothing better! they are quite\r\nready! And this is not permitted! This is forbidden!\r\n\r\nYes, Monseigneur, this is forbidden!\r\n\r\nWho opposes it? Who does not permit it? Who forbids it?\r\n\r\nMonsieur Bonaparte, you are master, you have eight millions of votes\r\nfor your crimes, and twelve millions of francs for your pleasures; you\r\nhave a Senate, with M. Sibour in it; you have armies, cannon,\r\nfortresses, Troplongs flat on their bellies, and Baroches on all fours;\r\nyou are a despot; you are all-potent; some one lost in the obscurity,\r\nunknown, a mere passer-by, rises before you, and says to you: \"Thou\r\nshalt not do this.\"\r\n\r\nThis some one, this voice that speaks in the darkness, not seen but\r\nheard, this passer-by, this unknown, this insolent intruder, is the\r\nhuman conscience.\r\n\r\nThat is what the human conscience is.\r\n\r\nIt is some one, I repeat, whom one sees not, and who is stronger than\r\nan army, more numerous than seven million five hundred thousand votes,\r\nmore lofty than a senate, more religious than an archbishop, more\r\nlearned in law than M. Troplong, more prompt to anticipate any sort of\r\njustice than M. Baroche, and who thee-and-thous your majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAN EXPLANATION FOR M. BONAPARTE'S BENEFIT\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us go a little deeper into all these novelties.\r\n\r\nPray learn this also, M. Bonaparte: that which distinguishes man from\r\nbrute, is the notion of good and of evil--of that good and that evil of\r\nwhich I was speaking to you just now.\r\n\r\nThere is the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe animal is a complete being. That which constitutes the grandeur of\r\nman is the being incomplete; it is the feeling one's self to be many\r\ndegrees removed from completion; it is the perceiving something on that\r\nside of one's self, something on this side. This something is mystery;\r\nit is--to make use of those feeble human expressions which always come\r\none by one, and never express more than one side of things--the moral\r\nworld. This moral world man bathes in, as much as, more than, in the\r\nmaterial world. He lives in what he feels, more than in what he sees.\r\nCreation may beset him, want may assail him, pleasure may tempt him,\r\nthe beast within him may torment him, but all in vain; a sort of\r\nincessant aspiration toward another world impels him irresistibly\r\nbeyond creation, beyond want, beyond pleasure, beyond the beast. He\r\nglimpses everywhere, at every moment, the upper world, and he fills his\r\nsoul with that vision, and regulates his actions by it. He does not\r\nfeel complete in this life on earth. He bears within him, so to speak,\r\na mysterious pattern of the anterior and ulterior world--the perfect\r\nworld--with which he is incessantly, and despite himself, comparing the\r\nimperfect world, and himself, and his infirmities, and his appetites,\r\nand his passions, and his actions. When he perceives that he is\r\napproaching this ideal pattern, he is overjoyed; when he sees that he\r\nis receding from it, he is sad. He understands thoroughly that there\r\nis nothing useless or superfluous in this world, nothing which does\r\nnot proceed from something, and which does not lead to something. The\r\njust, the unjust, good, evil, good works, evil deeds, fall into the\r\nabyss, but are not lost there, passing on into the infinite, for the\r\nbenefit or the burden of those who have accomplished them. After death\r\nthey are collected, and the sum-total cast up. To disappear, to vanish,\r\nto be annihilated, to cease to be, is no more possible for the moral\r\natom than for the material atom. Hence, in man, that great twofold\r\nsense of his liberty and of his responsibility. It is given him to be\r\ngood or to be bad. It is an account that will have to be settled. He\r\nmay be guilty, and therein--a striking circumstance upon which I\r\ndwell--consists his grandeur. There is nothing similar for the brute.\r\nWith the brute it is all instinct: to drink when thirsty, to eat when\r\nhungry, to procreate in due season, to sleep when the sun sets, to wake\r\nwhen it rises, or _vice versa_, if it be a beast of night. The brute\r\nhas only an obscure sort of _ego_, illumined by no moral light. Its\r\nentire law, I repeat, is instinct: instinct, a sort of railway, along\r\nwhich inevitable nature impels the brute. No liberty, therefore, no\r\nresponsibility, and consequently no future life. The brute does neither\r\nevil nor good; it is wholly ignorant. Even the tiger is innocent.\r\n\r\nIf, perchance, you were innocent as the tiger!\r\n\r\nAt certain moments one is tempted to believe that, having no warning\r\nvoice within, any more than the tiger, you have no more sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nReally, at times I pity you. Who knows? perhaps after all, you are only\r\na miserable blind force!\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte, you have not the notion of good and evil. You are,\r\nperhaps, the only man of all mankind who has not that notion. This\r\ngives you a start over the human race. Yes, you are formidable. It is\r\nthat which constitutes your genius, it is said; I admit that, at all\r\nevents, it is that which at this moment constitutes your power.\r\n\r\nBut do you know what results from this sort of power? Possession, yes;\r\nright, no.\r\n\r\nCrime essays to deceive history as to its true name; it says, \"I am\r\nsuccess.\"--Thou art crime!\r\n\r\nYou are crowned and masked. Down with the mask! Down with the crown!\r\n\r\nAh! you are wasting your trouble, you are wasting your appeals to the\r\npeople, your plebiscites, your ballots, your footings, your executive\r\ncommittees proclaiming the sum total, your red or green banners, with\r\nthese figures in gold paper,--7,500,000! You will derive no advantage\r\nfrom this elaborate _mise-en-scène_. There are things about which\r\nuniversal sentiment is not to be gulled. The human race, taken as a\r\nwhole, is an honest man.\r\n\r\nEven by those about you you are judged. There is not one of your\r\ndomestics, whether in gold lace or in embroidered coat, valet of the\r\nstable, or valet of the Senate, who does not say beneath his breath\r\nthat which I say aloud. What I proclaim, they whisper; that is the only\r\ndifference. You are omnipotent, they bend the knee, that is all. They\r\nsalute you, their brows burning with shame.\r\n\r\nThey feel that they are base, but they know that you are infamous.\r\n\r\nCome, since you are by way of hunting those whom you call \"the rebels\r\nof December,\" since it is on them you are setting your hounds, since\r\nyou have instituted a Maupas, and created a ministry of police\r\nspecially for that purpose, I denounce to you that rebel, that\r\nrecusant, that insurgent, every man's conscience.\r\n\r\nYou give money, but 'tis the hand receives it, not the conscience.\r\nConscience! while you are about it, inscribe it on your lists of\r\nexiles. It is an obstinate opponent, pertinacious, persistent,\r\ninflexible, making a disturbance everywhere. Drive it out of France.\r\nYou will be at ease then.\r\n\r\nWould you like to know what it calls you, even among your friends?\r\nWould you like to know in what terms an honourable chevalier of\r\nSaint-Louis, an octogenarian, a great antagonist of \"demagogues,\" and a\r\npartisan of yours, cast his vote for you on the 20th of December? \"He\r\nis a scoundrel,\" said he, \"but a _necessary scoundrel_.\"\r\n\r\nNo! there are no necessary scoundrels. No! crime is never useful! No!\r\ncrime is never a good. Society saved by treason! Blasphemy! we must\r\nleave it to the archbishops to say these things. Nothing good has evil\r\nfor its basis. The just God does not impose on mankind the necessity\r\nfor scoundrels. There is nothing necessary in this world but justice\r\nand truth. Had that venerable man thought less of life and more of the\r\ntomb, he would have seen this. Such a remark is surprising on the part\r\nof one advanced in years, for there is a light from God which\r\nenlightens souls approaching the tomb, and shows them the truth.\r\n\r\nNever do crime and the right come together: on the day when they should\r\nmeet, the words of the human tongue would change their meaning, all\r\ncertainty would vanish, social darkness would supervene. When, by\r\nchance, as has been sometimes seen in history, it happens that, for a\r\nmoment, crime has the force of law, the very foundations of humanity\r\ntremble. \"_Jusque datum sceleri!_\" exclaims Lucan, and that line\r\ntraverses history, like a cry of horror.\r\n\r\nTherefore, and by the admission of your voters, you are a scoundrel. I\r\nomit the word necessary. Make the best of this situation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, be it so,\" you say. \"But that is precisely the case in question:\r\none procures 'absolution' by universal suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nImpossible.\r\n\r\nWhat! impossible?\r\n\r\nYes, impossible. I will put your finger on the impossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAXIOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are a captain of artillery at Berne, Monsieur Louis Bonaparte; you\r\nhave necessarily a smattering of algebra and geometry. Here are certain\r\naxioms of which you have, probably, some idea.\r\n\r\nTwo and two make four.\r\n\r\nBetween two given points, the straight line is the shortest way.\r\n\r\nA part is less than the whole.\r\n\r\nNow, cause seven million five hundred thousand voters to declare that\r\ntwo and two make five, that the straight line is the longest way, that\r\nthe whole is less than a part; cause eight millions, ten millions, a\r\nhundred millions of voters so to declare, and you will not have\r\nadvanced a single step.\r\n\r\nWell--you will be surprised to hear it--there are axioms in probity, in\r\nhonesty, in justice, as there are axioms in geometry; and moral truth\r\nis no more at the mercy of a vote than is algebraic truth.\r\n\r\nThe notion of good and evil is insoluble by universal suffrage. It is\r\nnot given to a ballot to make the false true, or injustice just. Human\r\nconscience is not to be put to the vote.\r\n\r\nNow, do you understand?\r\n\r\nLook at that lamp, that little obscure light, unnoticed, forgotten in a\r\ncorner, lost in the darkness. Look at it, admire it. It is hardly\r\nvisible; it burns in solitude. Make seven million five hundred thousand\r\nmouths breathe upon it at once, and you will not extinguish it. You\r\nwill not even cause the flame to flicker. Cause a hurricane to blow;\r\nthe flame will continue to ascend, straight and pure, towards Heaven.\r\n\r\nThat lamp is Conscience.\r\n\r\nThat flame is the flame which illumines, in the night of exile, the\r\npaper on which I now write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWHEREIN M. BONAPARTE HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nThus then, be your figures what they may, counterfeit or genuine, true\r\nor false, extorted or not, it matters little; they who keep their eyes\r\nsteadfastly on justice say, and will continue to say, that crime is\r\ncrime, that perjury is perjury, that treachery is treachery, that\r\nmurder is murder, that blood is blood, that slime is slime, that a\r\nscoundrel is a scoundrel, that the man who fancies he is copying\r\nNapoleon _en petit_, is copying Lacenaire _en grand_; they say that,\r\nand they will repeat it, despite your figures, seeing that seven\r\nmillion five hundred thousand votes weigh as nothing against the\r\nconscience of the honest man; seeing that ten millions, that a hundred\r\nmillions of votes, that even the whole of mankind, voting _en masse_,\r\nwould count as nothing against that atom, that molecule of God, the\r\nsoul of the just man; seeing that universal suffrage, which has full\r\nsovereignty over political questions, has no jurisdiction over moral\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nI put aside for the moment, as I said just now, your process of\r\nballotting, with eyes bandaged, gag in mouth, cannon in the streets and\r\nsquares, sabres drawn, spies swarming, silence and terror leading the\r\nvoter to the ballot-box as a malefactor to the prison; I put these\r\naside; I assume (I repeat) genuine universal suffrage, free, pure,\r\nreal; universal suffrage controlling itself, as it ought to do;\r\nnewspapers in everybody's hands, men and facts questioned and sifted,\r\nplacards covering the walls, speech everywhere, enlightenment\r\neverywhere! Very good! to universal suffrage of this sort submit peace\r\nand war, the strength of the army, the public credit, the budget, the\r\npublic aid, the penalty of death, the irremovability of judges, the\r\nindissolubility of marriages, divorce, the civil and political status\r\nof women, free education, the constitution of the commune, the rights\r\nof labour, the payment of the clergy, free trade, railways, the\r\ncurrency, colonisation, the fiscal code,--all the problems, the\r\nsolution of which does not involve its own abdication--for universal\r\nsuffrage may do everything except abdicate; submit these things to it\r\nand it will solve them, not without error, perhaps, but with the grand\r\ntotal of certitude that appertains to human sovereignty; it will solve\r\nthem masterfully. Now, put to it the question whether John or Peter did\r\nwell or ill in stealing an apple from an orchard. At that, it halts; it\r\nis at fault. Why? Is it because this question is on a lower plane? No:\r\nit is because it is on a higher plane. All that constitutes the proper\r\norganization of societies, whether you consider them as territory,\r\ncommune, state, as country, every political, financial, social matter,\r\ndepends on universal suffrage and obeys it; the smallest atom of the\r\nsmallest moral question defies it.\r\n\r\nThe ship is at the mercy of the ocean, the star is not.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of M. Leverrier and of yourself, Monsieur Bonaparte,\r\nthat you were the only two men who believed in your star. You do, in\r\nfact, believe in your star; you look for it above your head. Well, that\r\nstar which you seek outside of yourself, other men have within\r\nthemselves. It shines beneath the vaulted roof of their brain, it\r\nenlightens and guides them, it shows them the true outlines of life; it\r\nexhibits to them, in the obscurity of human destiny, good and evil, the\r\njust and the unjust, the real and the false, ignominy and honour,\r\nhonesty and knavery, virtue and crime. This star, without which the\r\nhuman soul is but darkness, is moral truth.\r\n\r\nWanting this light, you have deceived yourself. Your ballot of the 20th\r\nof December is, in the eyes of the thinker, merely a sort of monstrous\r\nsimplicity. You have applied what you call \"universal suffrage\" to a\r\nquestion to which universal suffrage did not apply. You are not a\r\npolitician, you are a malefactor. The question what is to be done with\r\nyou is no concern of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nYes, simplicity; I insist on the term. The bandit of the Abruzzi, his\r\nhands scarcely laved of the blood which still remains under his nails,\r\ngoes to seek absolution from the priest; you have sought absolution\r\nfrom the ballot, only you have forgotten to confess. And, in saying to\r\nthe ballot, \"Absolve me,\" you put the muzzle of your pistol to its\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAh, wretched, desperate man! To \"absolve you,\" as you call it, is\r\nbeyond the popular power, is beyond all human power.\r\n\r\nListen:\r\n\r\nNero, who had invented the Society of the Tenth-of-December, and who,\r\nlike yourself, employed it in applauding his comedies, and even, like\r\nyou again, his tragedies,--Nero, after he had slashed his mother's\r\nbelly a hundred times with a dagger, might, like you, have appealed to\r\nhis universal suffrage, which had this further resemblance to yours,\r\nthat it was no more impeded by the license of the press; Nero, Pontiff\r\nand Emperor, surrounded by judges and priests prostrate at his feet,\r\nmight have placed one of his bleeding hands on the still warm corpse of\r\nthe Empress, and raising the other towards Heaven, have called all\r\nOlympus to witness that he had not shed that blood, and have adjured\r\nhis universal suffrage to declare in the face of gods and of men that\r\nhe, Nero, had not killed that woman; his universal suffrage, working\r\nmuch as yours works, with the same intelligence, and the same liberty,\r\nmight have affirmed by 7,500,000 votes that the divine Cæsar Nero,\r\nPontiff and Emperor, had done no harm to that woman who lay dead;\r\nunderstand, monsieur, that Nero would not have been \"absolved;\" it\r\nwould have sufficed for one voice, one single voice on earth, the\r\nhumblest and most obscure, to lie raised amid that profound night of\r\nthe Roman Empire, and to cry: \"Nero is a parricide!\" for the echo, the\r\neternal echo of the human conscience to repeat for ever, from people to\r\npeople, and from century to century: \"Nero slew his mother!\"\r\n\r\nWell, that voice which protests in the darkness is mine. I exclaim\r\nto-day, and, doubt not that the universal conscience of mankind repeats\r\nwith me: \"Louis Bonaparte has assassinated France! Louis Bonaparte has\r\nslain his mother!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\nTHE ABSOLUTION:--SECOND PHASE: THE OATH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFOR AN OATH, AN OATH AND A HALF\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Louis Bonaparte? He is perjury personified; he is mental\r\nreservation incarnate, felony in flesh and bone; he is a false oath\r\nwearing a general's hat, and calling himself Monseigneur.\r\n\r\nWell! what is it that he demands of France, this man-ambuscade? An\r\noath.\r\n\r\nAn oath!\r\n\r\nIndeed, after the 20th of December, 1848, and the 2nd of December,\r\n1851, after the inviolate representatives of the people had been\r\narrested and hunted down; after the confiscation of the Republic, after\r\nthe _coup d'état_, one might have expected from this malefactor an\r\nhonest cynical laugh at the oath, and that this Sbrigani would say to\r\nFrance: \"Oh, yes! it is true! I did pledge my word of honour. It is\r\nvery funny. Let us say no more about such nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nNot so: he requires an oath.\r\n\r\nAnd so, mayors, gendarmes, judges, spies, prefects, generals,\r\n_sergents-de-ville_, _gardes champêtres_, commissaries of police,\r\nmagistrates, office-holders, Senators, Councillors of State,\r\nlegislators, clerks, it is said, it is his will, this idea has passed\r\nthrough his head, he will have it so, it is his good pleasure; lose no\r\ntime, start off, you to the registrar, you to a confessional, you under\r\nthe eye of your brigadier, you to the minister, you, Senators, to the\r\nTuileries, to the salon of the marshals, you, spies, to the prefecture\r\nof police, you, first presidents and solicitors-general to M.\r\nBonaparte's ante-chamber; hasten in carriages, on foot, on horseback,\r\nin gown, in scarf, in court dress, in uniform, gold-laced, bespangled,\r\nembroidered, beplumed, with cap on head, ruff at the neck, sash around\r\nthe waist, and sword by the side; place yourselves, some before the\r\nplaster bust, others before the man himself; very good, there you are,\r\nall of you, none are missing; look him well in the face, reflect,\r\nsearch your conscience, your loyalty, your decency, your religion; take\r\noff your glove, raise your hand, and take oath to his perjury, swear\r\nfealty to his treason.\r\n\r\nHave you done it? Yes! Ah, what a precious farce!\r\n\r\nSo Louis Bonaparte takes the oath _au sérieux_. True, he believes in my\r\nword, in yours, in ours, in theirs; he believes everybody's word but\r\nhis own. He demands that everybody about him shall swear, and he orders\r\nthem to be loyal. It pleases Messalina to be surrounded by virgins.\r\nCapital!\r\n\r\nHe requires all to be honourable; you must understand this,\r\nSaint-Arnaud, and you, Maupas, must look upon it as final.\r\n\r\nBut let us sift things to the bottom; there are oaths and oaths. The\r\noath which freely, solemnly, before the face of God and man, having\r\nreceived a note of confidence from 6,000,000 of citizens, one swears\r\nbefore the National Assembly, to the constitution of his country, to\r\nthe law, to the people, and to France, that is nothing, it is not\r\nbinding, one can trifle with it, laugh at it, and some fine day trample\r\nit under foot; but the oath that one swears before the cannon's mouth,\r\nat the sword's point, under the eye of the police, in order to retain\r\nthe employment that gives one food, to preserve the rank which is one's\r\nproperty; the oath which, to save one's daily bread and that of one's\r\nchildren, one swears to a villain, a rebel, the violator of the laws,\r\nthe slaughterer of the Republic, a fugitive from every court, the man\r\nwho himself has broken his oath--oh! that oath is sacred! Let us not\r\njest.\r\n\r\nThe oath that we take on the 2nd of December, nephew of the 18th\r\nBrumaire, is sacrosanct!\r\n\r\nWhat I admire most is its ineptitude. To receive as so much ready money\r\nand coin of good alloy, all those \"I swear\" of the official commons;\r\nnot even to think that every scruple has been overcome, and that there\r\ncannot be in them all one single word of pure metal! He is both a\r\nprince and a traitor! To set the example from the summit of the State,\r\nand to imagine that it will not be followed! To sow lead, and expect to\r\nreap gold! Not even to perceive that, in such a case, every conscience\r\nwill model itself on the conscience at the summit, and that the perjury\r\nof the prince transmutes all oaths into counterfeit coin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE IN PRICE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd from whom, then, are oaths required? From that prefect? he has\r\nbetrayed the state. From that general? he has betrayed his colours.\r\nFrom that magistrate? he has betrayed the law. From all these\r\noffice-holders? they have betrayed the Republic. A strange thing, and\r\ncalculated to make the philosopher reflect, is this heap of traitors\r\nfrom which comes this heap of oaths!\r\n\r\nLet us, then, dwell upon this charming feature of the 2nd of\r\nDecember:--\r\n\r\nM. Bonaparte Louis believes in men's oaths! he believes in the oaths\r\nthat one takes to him! When M. Rouher takes off his glove, and says, \"I\r\nswear;\" when M. Suin takes off his glove, and says, \"I swear;\" when M.\r\nTroplong places his hand upon his breast, on that spot where is placed\r\nthe third button of a senator, and the heart of other men, and says, \"I\r\nswear,\" M. Bonaparte feels tears in his eyes; deeply moved, he foots\r\nup all these loyalties, and contemplates all these creatures with\r\nprofound emotion. He trusts! he believes! Oh, abyss of candour! Really,\r\nthe innocence of rogues sometimes elicits the wonder of honest men.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, must astonish the kindly-disposed observer and vex\r\nhim a little; that is, the capricious and disproportionate manner in\r\nwhich oaths are paid for, the inequality of the prices that M.\r\nBonaparte places on this commodity. For example, M. Vidocq, if he were\r\nstill chief of police, would receive six thousand francs per annum, M.\r\nBaroche receives eighty thousand. It follows, then, that the oath of M.\r\nVidocq would bring him in but 16 francs 66 centimes per day, while\r\nthe oath of M. Baroche brings him in 222 francs 22 centimes. This is\r\nevidently unjust; why such a difference? An oath is an oath; an oath\r\nconsists of a glove removed and six letters. How much more is there in\r\nM. Baroche's oath than in M. Vidocq's?\r\n\r\nYou will tell me that it is owing to the difference of their functions;\r\nthat M. Baroche presides in the Council of State, and that M. Vidocq\r\nwould be merely the chief of police. My answer is, that it is but\r\nchance; that probably M. Baroche might excel in directing the police,\r\nand that M. Vidocq might very well be President of the Council of\r\nState. This is no reason.\r\n\r\nAre there then several sorts of oaths? Is it the same as with masses?\r\nAre there, in this business also, masses at forty sous, and masses at\r\nten sous, which latter, as the priest said, are but \"rubbish?\" Does the\r\nquality of the oath vary with the price? Are there in this commodity of\r\nthe oath, superfine, extra-fine, fine, and half-fine? Are some oaths\r\nbetter than others? Are they more durable, less adulterated with tow\r\nand cotton, better dyed? Are there new oaths, still unused, oaths worn\r\nat the knees, patched oaths and ragged oaths? Is there any choice? Let\r\nus know it. The thing is worth while. It is we who pay. Having made\r\nthese observations in the interest of those who are contributors, I\r\nhumbly beg pardon of M. Vidocq for having made use of his name. I admit\r\nthat I had no right to do so. Besides, M. Vidocq might possibly have\r\nrefused the oath!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOATHS OF SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a priceless detail: M. Bonaparte was desirous that Arago should\r\ntake the oath. Understand,--astronomy must swear fealty. In a\r\nwell-regulated state, like France or China, everything is bureaucracy,\r\neven science. The mandarin of the Institute depends upon the mandarin\r\nof the police. The great parallactic telescope owes homage to M.\r\nBonaparte. An astronomer is a sort of constable of the heavens. The\r\nobservatory is like any sentry-box. It is necessary to keep an eye on\r\nthe good God up yonder, who seems sometimes not to submit absolutely\r\nto the Constitution of the 14th of January. The heavens are full of\r\nunpleasant allusions, and require to be kept in order. The discovery\r\nof a new spot on the sun is evidently a case for the censorship. The\r\nprediction of a high tide may be seditious. The announcement of an\r\neclipse of the moon may be treason. We are a bit moonstruck at the\r\nÉlysée. Free astronomy is almost as dangerous as a free press. Who can\r\ntell what takes place in those nocturnal _tête-à-têtes_ between Arago\r\nand Jupiter? If it were M. Leverrier, well and good!--but a member\r\nof the Provincial Government! Beware, M. de Maupas! the Bureau of\r\nLongitude must make oath not to conspire with the stars, and especially\r\nwith those mad artisans of celestial _coups d'états_ which are\r\ncalled comets.\r\n\r\nThen, too, as we have already said, one is a fatalist when one is a\r\nBonaparte. Napoleon the Great had his star, Napoleon the Little ought\r\nsurely to have a nebula; the astronomers are certainly something of\r\nastrologers. So take the oath, gentlemen. It goes without saying that\r\nArago refused.\r\n\r\nOne of the virtues of the oath to Louis Bonaparte is that, according as\r\nit is refused or taken, that oath gives you or takes from you merits,\r\naptitudes, talents. You are a professor of Greek or Latin; take the\r\noath, or you are deprived of your chair, and you no longer know Greek\r\nor Latin. You are a professor of rhetoric; take the oath, or tremble;\r\nthe story of Theramenes and the dream of Athalie are interdicted; you\r\nshall wander about them for the rest of your days, and never again be\r\npermitted to enter. You are a professor of philosophy; take the oath to\r\nM. Bonaparte,--if not, you become incapable of understanding the\r\nmysteries of the human conscience, and of explaining them to young men.\r\nYou are a professor of medicine; take the oath,--if not, you no longer\r\nknow how to feel the pulse of a feverish patient. But if the good\r\nprofessors depart, will there be any more good pupils? Particularly in\r\nmedicine, this is a serious matter. What is to become of the sick? The\r\nsick? as if we cared about the sick! The important thing is that\r\nmedicine should take the oath to M. Bonaparte. For it comes to this:\r\neither the seven million five hundred thousand votes have no sense, or\r\nit is evident that it would be better to have your leg amputated by an\r\nass who has taken the oath, than by a refractory Dupuytren.\r\n\r\nAh! one would fain jest, but all this makes the heart sad. Are you a\r\nyoung and generous spirit, like Deschanel; a sane and upright\r\nintellect, like Despois; a serious and powerful mind, like Jacques; an\r\neminent writer, a popular historian, like Michelet--take the oath, or\r\ndie of hunger.\r\n\r\nThey refuse! The darkness and silence, in which they stoically seek\r\nrefuge, know the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCURIOSITIES OF THE BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll morality is denied by such an oath, the cup of shame drained to the\r\ndregs, all decency outraged. There is no reason why one should not see\r\nunheard-of things, and one sees them. In some towns, Evreux for\r\nexample, the judges who have taken the oath sit in judgment on the\r\njudges who have refused it;[1] dishonour seated on the bench places\r\nhonour at the bar; the sold conscience \"reproves\" the upright\r\nconscience; the courtesan lashes the virgin.\r\n\r\n      [1] The President of the Tribunal of Commerce at Evreux refused\r\n      to take the oath. Let us listen to the _Moniteur_:\r\n\r\n          \"M. Verney, late President of the Tribunal of Commerce at\r\n          Evreux, was cited to appear, on Thursday last, before the\r\n          correctional judges of Evreux, on account of facts that took\r\n          place on the 29th of April last, within the consular\r\n          auditory.\r\n\r\n          \"M. Verney is accused of inciting to hatred and treason\r\n          against the Government.\"\r\n\r\n      The judges of first instance discharged M. Verney, and \"reproved\"\r\n      him. Appeal _a minima_ by the \"procureur of the Republic.\"\r\n      Sentence of the Court of Appeal of Rouen:--\r\n\r\n          \"The Court,--\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas the prosecution has no other object than the\r\n          repression of the crime of inciting to hatred and scorn of\r\n          the Government;\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas that offence would result, according to the\r\n          prosecution, from the last paragraph of the letter of M.\r\n          Verney to the procureur of the Republic at Evreux, on the\r\n          26th of April last, which is thus worded:--\r\n\r\n          \"'But it would be too serious a matter to barter any longer\r\n          what we conceive to be right. The magistracy itself will owe\r\n          us thanks for not exposing the ermine of the judge to succumb\r\n          under the formality which your dispatch announces.'\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas, however blamable _the conduct of Verney has been in\r\n          this affair_, the Court cannot see in that portion of the\r\n          letter, the offence of inciting to hatred and contempt of the\r\n          Government, since the order by which force was to be employed\r\n          to prevent the judges from taking their seats who had refused\r\n          to take the oaths, did not emanate from the Government;\r\n\r\n          \"Whereas there is no ground, therefore, for applying to him\r\n          the penal code;\r\n\r\n          \"For these reasons,\r\n\r\n          \"Confirms the judgment without costs.\"\r\n\r\n      The Court of Appeal at Rouen has for its first President, M.\r\n      Franck-Carré, formerly procureur-general to the Court of Peers in\r\n      the prosecution at Boulogne; the same who addressed to M. Louis\r\n      Bonaparte these words: \"You have caused corruption to be employed\r\n      and money to be distributed to buy treason.\"\r\n\r\nWith this oath one journeys from surprise to surprise. Nicolet was but\r\na booby compared to M. Bonaparte. When M. Bonaparte had had the circuit\r\nmade of his valets, his accomplices, and his victims, and had pocketed\r\nall their oaths, he turned good-naturedly to the valiant chiefs of the\r\nAfrican army, and \"spoke to them nearly in these words:\" \"By the bye,\r\nyou are aware I caused you to be arrested at night, by my men, when you\r\nwere in your beds; my spies broke into your domiciles, sword in hand; I\r\nhave in fact decorated them for that feat of arms; I caused you to be\r\nthreatened with the gag if you uttered a cry; my agents took you by the\r\ncollar; I have had you placed in a felon's cell at Mazas, and in my own\r\ndungeon at Ham; your hands still bear the marks of the cords with which\r\nI bound you. Bonjour, messieurs, may God have you in his keeping; swear\r\nfealty to me.\" Changarnier fixed his eyes upon him, and made answer:\r\n\"No, traitor!\" Bedeau replied: \"No, forger!\" Lamoricière replied: \"No,\r\nperjurer!\" Leflô answered: \"No, bandit!\" Charras struck him in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAt this moment M. Bonaparte's face is red, not from shame, but from the\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nThere is one other variety of the oath. In the fortresses, in the\r\nprisons, in the hulks, in the jails of Africa, there are thousands of\r\nprisoners. Who are those prisoners? We have said,--republicans,\r\npatriots, soldiers of the law, innocent men, martyrs. Their sufferings\r\nhave already been proclaimed by generous voices, and one has a glimpse\r\nof the truth. In our special volume on the 2nd of December, it shall be\r\nour task to tear asunder the veil. Do you wish to know what is taking\r\nplace?--Sometimes, when endurance is at an end and strength exhausted,\r\nbending beneath the weight of misery, without shoes, without bread,\r\nwithout clothing, without a shirt, consumed by fever, devoured by\r\nvermin, poor artisans torn from their workshops, poor husbandmen\r\nforcibly taken from the plough, weeping for a wife, a mother, children,\r\na family widowed or orphaned, also without bread and perhaps without\r\nshelter, overdone, ill, dying, despairing,--some of these wretched\r\nbeings succumb, and consent to \"ask for pardon!\" Then a letter is\r\npresented for their signature, all written and addressed: \"To\r\nMonseigneur le Prince-President.\" We give publicity to this letter, as\r\nSieur Quentin Bauchart avows it.\r\n\r\n\"I, the undersigned, declare upon my honour, that I accept _most\r\nthankfully_ the pardon offered me by Prince Louis-Napoleon, and I\r\nengage never to become a member of any secret society, to respect the\r\nlaw, and be _faithful_ to the Government that the country has chosen\r\nby the votes of the 20th and 21st of December, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nLet not the meaning of this grave performance be misunderstood. This is\r\nnot clemency granted, it is clemency implored. This formula: \"Ask us\r\nfor your pardon,\" means: \"Grant us our pardon.\" The murderer, leaning\r\nover his victim and with his knife raised, cries: \"I have waylaid you,\r\nseized you, hurled you to the earth, despoiled and robbed you, passed\r\nmy knife through your body, and now you are under my feet, your blood\r\nis oozing from twenty wounds; _say you repent_, and I will not finish\r\nyou.\" This _repentance_ exacted by a criminal from an innocent man, is\r\nnothing else than the outward form which his inward remorse assumes.\r\nHe fancies that he is thus safeguarded against his own criminality.\r\nWhatever expedient he may adopt to deaden his feelings, although he may\r\nbe for ever ringing in his own ears the seven million five hundred\r\nthousand little bells of his plebiscite, the man of the _coup d'état_\r\nreflects at times; he catches vague glimpses of a tomorrow, and\r\nstruggles against the inevitable future. He must have legal purgation,\r\ndischarge, release from custody, quittance. He exacts it from the\r\nvanquished, and at need puts them to the torture, to obtain it. Louis\r\nBonaparte knows that there exists, in the conscience of every prisoner,\r\nof every exile, of every man proscribed, a tribunal, and that that\r\ntribunal is beginning his prosecution; he trembles, the executioner\r\nfeels a secret dread of his victim; and, under pretext of a pardon\r\naccorded by him to that victim, he forces his judges to sign his\r\nacquittal.\r\n\r\nThus he hopes to deceive France, which, too, is a living conscience and\r\na watchful tribunal; and that when the hour for passing sentence shall\r\nstrike, seeing that he has been absolved by his victims, she will\r\npardon him. He deceives himself. Let him cut a hole in the wall on\r\nanother side, he will not escape through that one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE 5TH OF APRIL, 1852\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1852, this is what was witnessed at the Tuileries.\r\nAbout eight in the evening, the ante-chamber was filled with men in\r\nscarlet robes, grave and majestic, speaking with subdued voices,\r\nholding in their hands black velvet caps, bedecked with gold lace; most\r\nof them were white-haired. These were the presidents and councillors of\r\nthe Court of Cassation, the first presidents of the Courts of Appeal,\r\nand the procureurs-general: all the superior magistracy of France.\r\nThese persons were kept waiting in the ante-chamber. An aide-de-camp\r\nushered them in and left them there. A quarter of an hour passed, half\r\nan hour, an hour; they wandered up and down the room, conversing,\r\nlooking at their watches, awaiting the ringing of the bell. After more\r\nthan an hour of tedious waiting they perceived that they had not even\r\nchairs to sit upon. One of them, M. Troplong, went to another room\r\nwhere the footmen were, and complained. A chair was brought him. At\r\nlast a folding-door was thrown open; they rushed pell-mell into a\r\nsalon. There a man in a black coat was standing with his back against\r\nthe chimney-piece. What errand summoned these men in red robes to this\r\nman in a black coat? They came to tender him their oaths. The man was\r\nM. Bonaparte. He nodded, and, in return, they bowed to the ground, as\r\nis meet. In front of M. Bonaparte, at a short distance, stood his\r\nchancellor, M. Abbattucci, late a liberal deputy, now Minister of\r\nJustice to the _coup d'état_. The ceremony began. M. Abbattucci\r\ndelivered a discourse, and M. Bonaparte made a speech. The Prince\r\ndrawled a few contemptuous words, looking at the carpet; he spoke of\r\nhis \"legitimacy;\" after which the magistrates took the oath. Each in\r\nturn raised his hand. While they were swearing, M. Bonaparte, his back\r\nhalf turned to them, laughed and chatted with his aides-de-camp, who\r\nwere grouped behind him. When it was over he quite turned his back upon\r\nthem, and they departed, shaking their heads, humbled and ashamed, not\r\nfor having done a base deed, but because they had had no chairs in the\r\nante-chamber.\r\n\r\nAs they were departing, the following dialogue was overheard:--\"That,\"\r\nsaid one of them, \"was an oath it was necessary to take.\" \"And,\" said\r\nanother, \"which it will be necessary to keep.\" \"Yes,\" said a third,\r\n\"like the master of the house.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is pure servility. Let us proceed.\r\n\r\nAmong these first presidents who swore fidelity to Louis Bonaparte,\r\nwere a certain number of former peers of France, who, as such, had\r\npassed upon Louis Bonaparte the sentence of perpetual imprisonment.\r\nBut why should we look back so far? Let us still proceed; here is\r\nsomething even better. Among these magistrates, there were seven\r\nindividuals, by name, Hardouin, Moreau, Pataille, Cauchy, Delapalme,\r\nGrandet, and Quesnault. Prior to the 2nd of December these seven men\r\ncomposed the High Court of Justice; the first, Hardouin, was president,\r\nthe last two, deputy-presidents, the other four, judges. These men had\r\nreceived and accepted from the Constitution of 1848 a mandate thus\r\nconceived:--\r\n\r\n\"Article 68. Every measure by which the President of the Republic shall\r\ndissolve the National Assembly, prorogue it or impede the performance\r\nof its decrees, is high treason.\r\n\r\n\"The judges of the High Court shall thereupon immediately assemble,\r\nunder penalty of forfeiture; they shall convoke the jurors in such\r\nplace as they shall appoint, to proceed to the trial of the President\r\nand his accomplices; they shall themselves appoint magistrates to\r\nperform the functions of the national administration.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of December, in the face of the flagrant felony, they had\r\nbegun the trial, and appointed a procureur-general, M. Renouard, who\r\nhad accepted the office, to proceed against Louis Bonaparte on the\r\ncharge of high treason. Let us add the name of Renouard to the seven.\r\nOn the 5th of April, they were, all eight, present in the antechamber\r\nof Louis Bonaparte; we have just seen what was their business there.\r\n\r\nHere it is impossible not to pause.\r\n\r\nThere are certain melancholy thoughts upon which one must have the\r\nstrength to insist; there are sinks of ignominy we must have the\r\ncourage to sound.\r\n\r\nCast your eyes upon that man. He was born at hazard, by misfortune, in\r\na hovel, in a cellar, in a cave, no one knows where, no one knows of\r\nwhom. He came out of the dust to fall into the mire. He had only so\r\nmuch father and mother as was necessary for his birth, after which all\r\nshrank from him. He has crawled on as best he could. He grew up\r\nbare-footed, bare-headed, in rags, with no idea why he was living. He\r\ncan neither read nor write, nor does he know that there are laws above\r\nhim; he scarcely knows there is a heaven. He has no home, no family, no\r\ncreed, no book. He is a blind soul. His intellect has never opened, for\r\nintellect opens only to light as flowers open only to the day, and he\r\ndwells in the dark. However, he must eat. Society has made him a brute\r\nbeast, hunger makes him a wild beast. He lies in wait for travellers on\r\nthe outskirts of a wood, and robs them of their purses. He is caught,\r\nand sent to the galleys. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nNow look at this other man; it is no longer the red cap, it is the red\r\nrobe. He believes in God, reads Nicole, is a Jansenist, devout, goes to\r\nconfession, takes the sacrament. He is well born, as they say, wants\r\nnothing, nor has ever wanted anything; his parents have lavished\r\neverything on his youth--trouble, instruction, advice, Greek and Latin,\r\nmasters in every science. He is a grave and scrupulous personage;\r\ntherefore he has been made a magistrate. Seeing this man pass his days\r\nin meditating upon all the great texts, both sacred and profane; in the\r\nstudy of the law, in the practice of religion, in the contemplation of\r\nthe just and unjust, society placed in his keeping all that it holds\r\nmost august, most venerable--the book of the law. It made him a judge,\r\nand the punisher of treason. It said to him: \"A day may come, an hour\r\nmay strike, when the chief by physical force shall trample under his\r\nfoot both the law and the rights of man; then you, man of justice, you\r\nwill arise, and smite with your rod the man of power.\"--For that\r\npurpose, and in expectation of that perilous and supreme day, it\r\nlavishes wealth upon him, and clothes him in purple and ermine. That\r\nday arrives, that hour, unique, pitiless, and solemn, that supreme hour\r\nof duty; the man in the red gown begins to stutter the words of the\r\nlaw; suddenly he perceives that it is not the cause of justice that\r\nprevails, but that treason carries the day. Whereupon he, the man who\r\nhas passed his life in imbuing himself with the pure and holy light of\r\nthe law, that man who is nothing unless he be the contemner of\r\nunmerited success, that lettered, scrupulous, religious man, that judge\r\nin whose keeping the law has been placed, and, in some sort, the\r\nconscience of the state, turns towards triumphant perjury, and with the\r\nsame lips, the same voice in which, if this traitor had been\r\nvanquished, he would have said:\r\n\r\n\"Criminal, I sentence you to the galleys,\" he says:\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur, I swear fealty to you.\"\r\n\r\nNow take a balance, place in one scale the judge, in the other the\r\nfelon, and tell me which side kicks the beam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nEVERYWHERE THE OATH\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the things we have beheld in France, on the occasion of the\r\noath to M. Bonaparte. Men have sworn here, there, everywhere; at Paris,\r\nin the provinces, in the north, in the south, in the cast, and in the\r\nwest. There was in France, during a whole month, a tableau of hands\r\nraised, of arms outstretched, and the final chorus was: \"We swear,\"\r\netc. The ministers placed their oaths in the hands of the President,\r\nthe prefects in those of ministers, and the mob in those of the\r\nprefects. What does M. Bonaparte do with all these oaths? Is he making\r\na collection of them? Where does he put them? It has been remarked\r\nthat none but unpaid functionaries have refused the oath, the\r\ncouncillors-general, for instance. The fact is, that the oath has been\r\ntaken to the budget. We heard on the 29th of March a senator exclaim,\r\nin a loud voice, against the omission of his name, which was, so to\r\nspeak, vicarious modesty. M. Sibour, Archbishop of Paris swore;[1] M.\r\nFrank Carré, procureur-general to the Court of Peers in the affair of\r\nBoulogne, swore;[2] M. Dupin, President of the National Assembly on the\r\n2nd of December, swore[3]--O, my God! it is enough to make one wring\r\none's hands for shame. An oath, however, is a sacred obligation.\r\n\r\n      [1] As Senator.\r\n\r\n      [2] As First President of the Court of Appeal at Rouen.\r\n\r\n      [3] As a member of his Municipal Council.\r\n\r\nThe man who takes an oath ceases to be a man, he becomes an altar, upon\r\nwhich God descends. Man, that infirmity, that shadow, that atom, that\r\ngrain of sand, that drop of water, that tear dropped from the eye of\r\ndestiny; man, so little, so weak, so uncertain, so ignorant, so\r\nrestless; man, who lives in trouble and in doubt, knowing little of\r\nyesterday, and nothing of to-morrow, seeing just enough of his road to\r\nplace his foot before him, and then nothing but darkness; who trembles\r\nif he looks forward, is sad if he looks back; man, enveloped in those\r\nimmensities and those obscurities, time, space, and being, and lost in\r\nthem; having an abyss within him, his soul; and an abyss without,\r\nheaven; man, who at certain hours bows his head with a sacred horror,\r\nunder every force of nature, under the roar of the sea, under the\r\nrustling of the trees, under the shadow of the mountain, under the\r\ntwinkling of the stars; man, who can not lift his head by day, without\r\nbeing blinded by the light, nor by night, without being crushed by the\r\ninfinite; man, who knows nothing, who sees nothing, who hears nothing,\r\nwho may be swept away to-morrow, to-day, now, by the waves that pass,\r\nby the breeze that blows, by the pebble that falls, by the hour that\r\nstrikes; on a certain day, man, that trembling, stumbling being, the\r\nplaything of chance and of the passing moment, rises suddenly before\r\nthe riddle that is called human life, feels that there is within him\r\nsomething greater than this abyss,--honour! something stronger than\r\nfatality,--virtue! something more mysterious than the unknown,--faith!\r\nand alone, feeble and naked, he says to all this formidable mystery\r\nthat envelopes him: \"Do with me what you will, but I will do this, and\r\nI will not do that;\" and proud, tranquil, serene, creating by a word a\r\nfixed point in the sombre instability that fills the horizon, as the\r\nmariner casts his anchor in the sea, he casts his oath into the future.\r\n\r\nO plighted oath! admirable confidence of the just man in himself!\r\nSublime permission given by God to man, to affirm! It is all over.\r\nThere are no more of them. Another of the soul's splendours that has\r\nvanished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\nPROGRESS CONTAINED IN THE COUP D'ÉTAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE QUANTUM OF GOOD CONTAINED IN EVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong us democrats, many well-meaning minds were stupefied by the event\r\nof the 2nd of December. It disconcerted some, discouraged others, and\r\nterrified many. I have seen some who cried: _Finis Poloniae_. As for\r\nmyself, since at certain times I am obliged to say, I, and to speak in\r\nthe face of history as a witness, I proclaim that I saw that event\r\nwithout perturbation. I say more than this, that at times, in the face\r\nof the 2nd of December, I declare myself satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhen I can abstract myself from the present, when for a moment I can\r\nturn my eyes away from all the crimes, from all the blood spilt, from\r\nall the victims, from all the proscribed, from those hulks that echo\r\nthe death rattle, from those deadful penal settlements of Lambessa and\r\nCayenne, where death is swift, from that exile where death is slow,\r\nfrom this vote, from this oath, from this vast stain of shame inflicted\r\nupon France, which is growing wider and wider each day; when,\r\nforgetting for a few moments these painful thoughts, the usual\r\nobsession of my mind, I succeed in confining myself within the severe\r\ncalmness of the politician, and in considering, not the fact, but the\r\nconsequences of the fact; then, among many results, disastrous beyond\r\ndoubt, a considerable, real, enormous progress becomes manifest to me,\r\nand, from that moment, while I am still of those whom the 2nd of\r\nDecember exasperates, I am no longer of those whom it afflicts.\r\n\r\nFixing my eyes upon certain points in the future, I say to myself: \"The\r\ndeed was infamous, but the result is good.\"\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to explain the inexplicable victory of the\r\n_coup d'état_ in a hundred ways. A true balance has been struck\r\nbetween all possible resistances, and they are neutralized one by the\r\nother: the people were afraid of the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie were\r\nafraid of the people;--the faubourgs hesitated before the restoration\r\nof the majority, fearing, wrongfully however, that their victory would\r\nbring back to power that Right which is so thoroughly unpopular; the\r\nshopocracy recoiled before the red republic; the people did not\r\nunderstand; the middle classes shuffled; some said, \"Whom shall we send\r\nto the legislative palace?\" others: \"whom are we going to see at the\r\nHotel de Ville?\" In fine, the rude repression of 1848, the insurrection\r\ncrushed by cannon-shot, the quarries, the casements, and the\r\ntransportations--a living and terrible recollection;--and then--Suppose\r\nsome one had succeeded in beating the call to arms! Suppose a single\r\nlegion had sallied forth! Suppose M. Sibour had been M. Affre, and had\r\nthrown himself in the midst of the bullets of the pretorians! Suppose\r\nthe High Court had not suffered itself to be driven away by a corporal!\r\nSuppose the judges had followed the example of the representatives, and\r\nwe had seen the scarlet gowns on the barricades, as we saw the scarfs!\r\nSuppose a single arrest had miscarried! Suppose a single regiment had\r\nhesitated! Suppose the massacre on the boulevards had not taken place,\r\nor had turned out ill for Louis Bonaparte! etc., etc., etc. This is all\r\ntrue, and yet what has been, was what was to be. Let us say again,\r\nunder the shadow of that monstrous victory vast and definitive progress\r\nis taking place. The 2nd of December succeeded, because in more than\r\none point of view, I repeat, it was good that it should succeed. All\r\nexplanations are just, but all are vain. The invisible hand is mingled\r\nin all this. Louis Bonaparte committed the crime; Providence brought\r\nabout the result.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it was essential that _order_ should come to the end of\r\nits logic. It was essential that people should learn, and should learn\r\nfor all time, that, in the mouths of the men of the past, that word\r\n_order_ signifies false oaths, perjury, pillage of the public cash-box,\r\ncivil war, courts-martial, confiscation, sequestration, deportation,\r\ntransportation, proscription, fusillades, police, censorship,\r\ndegradation of the army, disregard of the people, debasement of France,\r\na dumb Senate, the tribune overthrown, the press suppressed, a political\r\nguillotine, murder of liberty, garroting of the right, violation of\r\nlaws, sovereignty of the sword, massacre, treason, ambuscades. The\r\nspectacle that we have before our eyes is a profitable spectacle. What\r\nwe see in France since the 2nd of December is the debauch of order.\r\n\r\nYes, the hand of Providence is in it. Reflect, too, upon this: for\r\nfifty years the Republic and the Empire have filled men's imaginations,\r\nthe one with its souvenirs of terror, the other with its souvenirs of\r\nglory. Of the Republic men saw only 1793, that is to say, the terrible\r\nrevolutionary necessity,--the furnace; of the Empire they saw only\r\nAusterlitz. Hence a prejudice against the Republic, and prestige for\r\nthe Empire. Now, what is the future of France to be? is it the Empire?\r\nNo, it is the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to reverse that situation, to suppress the prestige\r\nof that which cannot be restored, and to suppress the prejudice against\r\nthat which must be. Providence did it: it destroyed those two mirages.\r\nFebruary came and took away from the Republic its terror; Louis\r\nBonaparte came and deprived the Empire of its prestige. Henceforth,\r\n1848, fraternity, is superimposed upon 1793, terror; Napoleon the\r\nLittle is superimposed upon Napoleon the Great. The two grand things,\r\none of which alarmed and the other dazzled, are receding. We perceive\r\n'93 only through its justification, and Napoleon only through his\r\ncaricature; the foolish fear of the guillotine vanishes, the empty\r\nimperial popularity disappears. Thanks to 1848, the Republic no longer\r\nterrifies; thanks to Louis Bonaparte, the Empire no longer fascinates.\r\nThe future has become possible. These are the secrets of the Almighty!\r\n\r\nBut the word republic is not sufficient; it is the _thing_ republic\r\nthat is wanting; well, we shall have the thing with the word. Let us\r\ndevelop this thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR INSTITUTIONS THAT STAND OPPOSED TO THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nAwaiting the marvellous but tardy simplifications which the union of\r\nEurope and the democratic federation of the continent will some day\r\nbring forth, what will be in France, the form of the social edifice, of\r\nwhose ill-defined and luminous outlines the thinking man already has a\r\nglimpse, through the darkness of dictatorships?\r\n\r\nThat form is this:--\r\n\r\nThe sovereign commune, ruled by an elective mayor; universal suffrage\r\neverywhere, subordinate to the national unity only in respect to acts\r\nof general concern; so much for the administration. Syndics and upright\r\nmen arranging the private differences of associations and industries;\r\nthe jury, magistrate of the fact, enlightening the judge, magistrate of\r\nthe law; elective judges; so much for justice. The priest excluded from\r\neverything except the church, living with his eye fixed on his book and\r\non Heaven, a stranger to the budget, unknown to the state, known only\r\nto his flock, no longer possessing authority, but possessing liberty;\r\nso much for religion. War confined to the defence of the territory. The\r\nwhole nation constituting a national guard, divided into three\r\ndistricts, and able to rise as one man; so much for power. The law for\r\never, the right for ever, the ballot for ever, the sword nowhere.\r\n\r\nNow, what were the obstacles to this future, to this magnificent\r\nrealization of the democratic ideal?\r\n\r\nThere were four material obstacles, namely:--\r\n\r\n    The standing army.\r\n    Centralized administration.\r\n    The office-holding clergy.\r\n    The irremovable magistracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSLOW MOVEMENT OF NORMAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat these four obstacles are, what they were even under the Republic\r\nof February, even under the Constitution of 1848; the evil they\r\nproduced, the good they prevented, what sort of past they perpetuated,\r\nwhat excellent social order they postponed, the publicist saw, the\r\nphilosopher knew, the nation did not know.\r\n\r\nThese four institutions, immense, ancient, solid, supported one upon\r\nanother, composite at their base and summit, growing like a hedge of\r\ntall old trees, their roots under our feet, their branches over our\r\nheads, smothered and crushed on all sides the scattered germs of the\r\nnew France. Where life and movement, association, local liberty,\r\ncommunal initiative should have been, there was administrative\r\ndespotism; where there should have been the intelligent vigilance,\r\narmed at need, of the patriot and the citizen, there was the passive\r\nobedience of the soldier; where the quick Christian faith should have\r\ngushed forth, there was the Catholic priest; where there should have\r\nbeen justice, there was the judge. And the future was there, under the\r\nfeet of suffering generations, which could not rise and were waiting.\r\n\r\nWas this known among the people? Was it suspected? Was it divined?\r\n\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nFar from it. In the eyes of the greater part, and of the middle classes\r\nin particular, these four obstacles were four buttresses. Army,\r\nmagistracy, administration, clergy, these were the four virtues of\r\norder, the four social powers, the four sacred pillars of the old\r\nFrench structure.\r\n\r\nAttack that, if you dare!\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation is saying, that in the state of blindness in which\r\nare plunged the best minds, with the measured march of normal progress,\r\nwith our assemblies, of which I shall not be suspected to be the\r\ndetractor, but which, when they are both honest and timid, as is often\r\nthe case, are disposed to be led only by their average men, that is, by\r\nmediocrity; with the committees of initiative, their delays and\r\nballottings, if the 2nd of December had not brought its overwhelming\r\ndemonstration, if Providence had not taken a hand, France would have\r\nremained condemned for an indefinite term to its irremovable\r\nmagistracy, to administrative centralization, to the standing army, and\r\nto the office-holding clergy.\r\n\r\nSurely, the power of the tribune and of the press combined, these two\r\ngreat forces of civilization,--it is not I who seek to deny or belittle\r\nthem; but see how many efforts of all kinds it would have required, in\r\nevery direction, and under every form, by the tribune and by the\r\nnewspaper, by the book and by the spoken word, to succeed even in\r\nshaking the universal prejudice in favor of these four fatal\r\ninstitutions! How many to succeed in overthrowing them! to exhibit the\r\nevidence to the eyes of all, to overcome selfish, passionate or\r\nunintelligent resistance, thoroughly to enlighten public opinion, the\r\nconsciences of the people, and the ruling powers, to cause this\r\nfourfold reform to force its way first into ideas, then into the laws.\r\nReckon up the speeches, the writings, the newspaper articles, the\r\nprojects of laws, the counter-projects, the amendments, the amendments\r\nto amendments, the reports, the counter-reports, the facts, the\r\nincidents, the polemics, the discussions, the assertions, the denials,\r\nthe storms, the steps forward, the steps backward, the days, the weeks,\r\nthe months, the years, the quarter-century, the half-century!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWHAT AN ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagine, on the benches of an assembly, the most intrepid of\r\nthinkers, a brilliant mind, one of those men who, when they ascend the\r\ntribune, feel it beneath them like the tripod of the oracle, suddenly\r\ngrow in stature and become colossal, surpass by a head the massive\r\nappearances that mask reality, and see clearly the future over the\r\nhigh, frowning wall of the present. That man, that orator, that seer,\r\nseeks to warn his country; that prophet seeks to enlighten statesmen;\r\nhe knows where the breakers are; he knows that society will crumble by\r\nmeans of these four false supports: centralized government, standing\r\narmy, irremovable judges, salaried priesthood; he knows it, he desires\r\nthat all should know it, he ascends the tribune and says:--\r\n\r\n\"I denounce to you four great public perils. Your political system\r\nbears that within it that will destroy it. It is incumbent upon you to\r\ntransform your government root and branch, the army, the clergy, and\r\nthe magistracy: to suppress here, retrench there, remodel everything,\r\nor perish through these four institutions, which you consider as\r\nlasting elements, but which are elements of dissolution.\"\r\n\r\nMurmurs. He exclaims: \"Do you know what your centralized administration\r\nmay become in the hands of a perjured executive power? A vast treason,\r\ncarried into effect at one blow over the whole of France, by every\r\noffice-holder without exception.\"\r\n\r\nMurmurs break out anew with redoubled violence; cries of \"order!\" The\r\norator continues: \"Do you know what your standing army may become at\r\nany moment? An instrument of crime. Passive obedience is the bayonet\r\never pointed at the heart of the law. Yes, here, in this France, which\r\nis the initiatress of the world, in this land of the tribune and the\r\npress, in this birthplace of human thought, yes, the time may come when\r\nthe sword will rule, when you, inviolable legislators, will be collared\r\nby corporals, when our glorious regiments will transform themselves,\r\nfor the profit of one man and to the shame of the nation, into\r\ngold-laced hordes and pretorian bands, when the sword of France will\r\nbecome a thing that strikes from behind, like the dagger of a hired\r\nassassin, when the life-blood of the first city in the world, done to\r\ndeath, will splash the gold epaulettes of your generals!\"\r\n\r\nThe murmur becomes an uproar, cries of \"Order!\" are heard from all\r\nquarters. The orator is interrupted: \"You have been insulting the\r\ngovernment, now you insult the army!\" The President calls the orator to\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe orator resumes:\r\n\r\n\"And if it should happen some day that a man, having in his hand the\r\nfive hundred thousand officeholders who constitute the government, and\r\nthe four hundred thousand soldiers composing the army, if it should\r\nhappen that this man should tear up the Constitution, should violate\r\nevery law, break every oath, trample upon every right, commit every\r\ncrime, do you know what your irremovable magistrates, instructors in\r\nthe right, and guardians of the law, would do? They would hold their\r\ntongues.\"\r\n\r\nThe uproar prevents the orator from completing his sentence. The tumult\r\nbecomes a tempest.--\"This man respects nothing. After the government\r\nand the army, he drags the magistracy in the mire! Censure! censure!\"\r\nThe orator is censured and the censure entered in the journal. The\r\nPresident declares that, if he continues, the Assembly will proceed to\r\na vote, and the floor will be taken from him.\r\n\r\nThe orator continues: \"And your paid clergy! and your office-holding\r\nbishops! On the day when a pretender shall have employed in such\r\nenterprises the government, the magistracy, and the army; on the day\r\nwhen all these institutions shall drip with the blood shed by and for\r\nthe traitor; when, placed between the man who has committed the crimes\r\nand God who orders an anathema to be launched against the criminal--do\r\nyou know what these bishops of yours will do? They will prostrate\r\nthemselves, not before God, but before man!\"\r\n\r\nCan you form any idea of the frenzied shouts and imprecations that\r\nwould greet such words? Can you imagine the shouts, the apostrophes,\r\nthe threats, the whole Assembly rising _en masse_, the tribune\r\nescaladed and with difficulty guarded by the ushers! The orator has\r\nprofaned every sanctified ark in succession, and he has ended by\r\nprofaning the Holy of Holies, the clergy! And what does he mean by it\r\nall? What a medley of impossible and infamous hypotheses! Do you not\r\nhear Baroche growl, and Dupin thunder? The orator would be called to\r\norder, censured, fined, suspended from the Chamber for three days, like\r\nPierre Leroux and Émile de Girardin; who can tell, perhaps expelled,\r\nlike Manuel.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day, the indignant citizen would say: \"That is well done!\"\r\nAnd from every quarter the journals devoted to order would shake their\r\nfist at the CALUMNIATOR. And in his own party, on his usual bench in\r\nthe Assembly, his best friends would forsake him, and say: \"It is his\r\nown fault; he has gone too far; he has imagined chimeras and\r\nabsurdities.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after this generous and heroic effort, it would be found that the\r\nfour institutions that have been attacked were more venerable and\r\nimpeccable than ever, and that the question, instead of advancing, had\r\nreceded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWHAT PROVIDENCE HAS DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Providence,--Providence goes about it differently. It places the\r\nthing luminously before your eyes, and says, \"Behold!\"\r\n\r\nA man arrives some fine morning,--and such a man! The first comer, the\r\nlast comer, without past, without future, without genius, without\r\nrenown, without prestige. Is he an adventurer? Is he a prince? This man\r\nhas his hands full of money, of bank-notes, of railroad shares, of\r\noffices, of decorations, of sinecures; this man stoops down to the\r\noffice-holders, and says, \"Office-holders, betray your trust!\"\r\n\r\nThe office-holders betray their trust.\r\n\r\nWhat, all? without one exception?\r\n\r\nYes, all!\r\n\r\nHe turns to the generals, and says: \"Generals, massacre.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the generals massacre.\r\n\r\nHe turns towards the irremovable judges, and says: \"Magistrates, I\r\nshatter the Constitution, I commit perjury, I dissolve the sovereign\r\nAssembly, I arrest the inviolate members, I plunder the public\r\ntreasury, I sequester, I confiscate, I banish those who displease me, I\r\ntransport people according to my fancy, I shoot down without summons to\r\nsurrender, I execute without trial, I commit all that men are agreed in\r\ncalling crime, I outrage all that men are agreed in calling right;\r\nbehold the laws--they are under my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will pretend not to see any thing,\" say the magistrates.\r\n\r\n\"You are insolent,\" replies the providential man. \"To turn your eyes\r\naway is to insult me. I propose that you shall assist me. Judges, you\r\nare going to congratulate me to-day, me who am force and crime; and\r\nto-morrow, those who have resisted me, those who are honor, right, and\r\nlaw, them you will try,--and you will condemn them.\"\r\n\r\nThese irremovable judges kiss his boot, and set about investigating\r\n_l'affaire des troubles_.\r\n\r\nThey swear fidelity to him, to boot.\r\n\r\nThen he perceives, in a corner, the clergy, endowed, gold-laced, with\r\ncross and cope and mitre, and he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are there, Archbishop! Come here. Just bless all this for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Archbishop chants his _Magnificat_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MINISTERS, ARMY, MAGISTRACY, AND CLERGY HAVE DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! what a striking thing and how instructive! \"_Erudimini_,\" Bossuet\r\nwould say.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers fancied that they were dissolving the Assembly; they\r\ndissolved the government.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers fired on the army and killed it.\r\n\r\nThe judges fancied that they were trying and convicting innocent\r\npersons; they tried and convicted the irremovable magistracy.\r\n\r\nThe priests thought they were chanting hosannahs upon Louis Bonaparte;\r\nthey chanted a _De profundis_ upon the clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen God desires to destroy a thing, he entrusts its destruction to the\r\nthing itself.\r\n\r\nEvery bad institution of this world ends by suicide.\r\n\r\nWhen they have weighed sufficiently long upon men, Providence, like the\r\nsultan to his viziers, sends them the bowstring by a mute, and they\r\nexecute themselves.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte is the mute of Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION--PART FIRST\r\n\r\nPETTINESS OF THE MASTER--ABJECTNESS OF THE SITUATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nNever fear, History has him in its grip.\r\n\r\nIf perchance it flatters the self-love of M. Bonaparte to be seized by\r\nhistory, if perchance, and truly one would imagine so, he cherishes any\r\nillusion as to his value as a political miscreant, let him divest\r\nhimself of it.\r\n\r\nLet him not imagine, because he has piled up horror on horror, that he\r\nwill ever raise himself to the elevation of the great historical\r\nbandits. We have been wrong, perhaps, in some pages of this book, here\r\nand there, to couple him with those men. No, although he has committed\r\nenormous crimes, he will remain paltry. He will never be other than the\r\nnocturnal strangler of liberty; he will never be other than the man who\r\nintoxicated his soldiers, not with glory, like the first Napoleon, but\r\nwith wine; he will never be other than the pygmy tyrant of a great\r\npeople. Grandeur, even in infamy, is utterly inconsistent with the\r\ncalibre of the man. As dictator, he is a buffoon; let him make himself\r\nemperor, he will be grotesque. That will finish him. His destiny is to\r\nmake mankind shrug their shoulders. Will he be less severely punished\r\nfor that reason? Not at all. Contempt does not, in his case, mitigate\r\nanger; he will be hideous, and he will remain ridiculous. That is all.\r\nHistory laughs and crushes.\r\n\r\nEven the most indignant chroniclers will not help him there. Great\r\nthinkers take satisfaction in castigating the great despots, and, in\r\nsome instances, even exalt them somewhat, in order to make them worthy\r\nof their rage; but what would you have the historian do with this\r\nfellow?\r\n\r\nThe historian can only lead him to posterity by the ear.\r\n\r\nThe man once stripped of success, the pedestal removed, the dust\r\nfallen, the tinsel and spangles and the great sabre taken away, the\r\npoor little skeleton laid bare and shivering,--can one imagine anything\r\nmeaner and more pitiful?\r\n\r\nHistory has its tigers. The historians, immortal keepers of wild\r\nbeasts, exhibit this imperial menagerie to the nations. Tacitus alone,\r\nthat great showman, captured and confined eight or ten of these tigers\r\nin the iron cage of his style. Look at them: they are terrifying and\r\nsuperb; their spots are an element in their beauty. This is Nimrod, the\r\nhunter of men; this, Busiris, the tyrant of Egypt; this, Phalaris, who\r\nbaked living men in a brazen bull, to make the bull roar; this,\r\nAhasuerus, who flayed the heads of the seven Maccabees, and had them\r\nroasted alive; this, Nero, the burner of Rome, who smeared Christians\r\nwith wax and pitch, and then set them alight as torches; this,\r\nTiberius, the man of Capræa; this, Domitian; this, Caracalla; this,\r\nHeliogabalus; that other is Commodus, who possesses an additional claim\r\nto our respect in the horrible fact that he was the son of Marcus\r\nAurelius; these are Czars; these, Sultans; these, Popes, among whom\r\nremark the tiger Borgia; here is Philip, called the Good, as the Furies\r\nwere called the Eumenides; here is Richard III, sinister and deformed;\r\nhere, with his broad face and his great paunch, Henry VIII, who, of\r\nfive wives that he had, killed three, one of whom he disemboweled; here\r\nis Christiern II, the Nero of the North; here Philip II, the Demon of\r\nthe South. They are terrifying: hear them roar, consider them, one\r\nafter the other; the historian brings them to you; the historian drags\r\nthem, raging and terrible, to the side of the cage, opens their jaws\r\nfor you, shows you their teeth and their claws; you can say of every\r\none of them: \"That is a royal tiger.\" In fact, they are taken from all\r\nthe thrones of the earth. History parades them through the ages. She\r\nprevents them from dying; she takes care of them. They are her tigers.\r\n\r\nShe does not mingle jackals with them.\r\n\r\nShe puts and keeps apart the disgusting beasts. M. Bonaparte will be\r\nwith Claudius, with Ferdinand VII of Spain, with Ferdinand II of\r\nNaples, in the hyena cage.\r\n\r\nHe is a bit of a brigand, and a great deal of a knave. One is always\r\nconscious of the poor prince of industry, who lived from hand to mouth\r\nin England; his present prosperity, his triumph, his empire, and his\r\ninflation amount to nothing; the purple mantle trails over shoes down\r\nat heel. Napoleon the Little, nothing more, nothing less. The title of\r\nthis book is well chosen.\r\n\r\nThe meanness of his vices prejudices the grandeur of his crimes. What\r\nwould you have? Peter the Cruel massacred, but he did not steal; Henry\r\nIII assassinated, but he did not swindle; Timour crushed children under\r\nhorses' hoofs, much as M. Bonaparte exterminated women and old men on\r\nthe boulevard, but he did not lie. Hear the Arabian historian:\r\n\"Timour-Beg, Sahib-Keran (master of the world and of the age, master of\r\nthe planetary conjunctions), was born at Kesch, in 1336; he slaughtered\r\na hundred thousand captives; as he was besieging Siwas, the\r\ninhabitants, to mollify him, sent him a thousand little children,\r\nbearing each a Koran on its head, and crying, 'Allah! Allah!' He caused\r\nthe sacred books to be removed with respect, and the children to be\r\ncrushed beneath the hoofs of wild horses. He used seventy thousand\r\nhuman heads, with cement, stone, and brick, in building towers at\r\nHerat, Sebzvar, Tekrit, Aleppo, and Bagdad; he detested lying; when he\r\nhad given his word, men could rely upon it.\"\r\n\r\nM. Bonaparte is not of this stature. He has not that dignity which the\r\ngreat despots of the East and of the West mingle with ferocity. The\r\namplitude of the Cæsars is wanting in him. To bear one's self worthily\r\nand make a fair appearance among all the illustrious executioners who\r\nhave tortured mankind in the course of four thousand years, one must\r\nnot have any mental hesitation between a general of division and a\r\nbass-drummer on the Champs-Elysées; one must not have been a constable\r\nin London; one must not have undergone, with lowered eyes, in the Court\r\nof Peers, the haughty scorn of M. Magnan; one must not have been called\r\n\"pickpocket\" by the English newspapers; one must not have been menaced\r\nwith Clichy; in a word, there must have been nothing of the sneak in\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Louis Napoleon, you are ambitious, you aim high, but you must\r\nhave the truth told you. Well, what would you have us do in the matter?\r\nIn vain have you, by overturning the tribune of France, realized, after\r\nyour fashion, the wish of Caligula: \"I would that mankind had but one\r\nhead, so that I might cut it off with a blow;\" in vain have you\r\nbanished the republicans by thousands, as Philip III expelled the\r\nMoors, and as Torquemada drove out the Jews; in vain have you dungeons\r\nlike Peter the Cruel, hulks like Hariadan, _dragonnades_ like Père\r\nLetellier, and _oubliettes_ like Ezzelino III; in vain have you\r\nperjured yourself like Ludovic Sforza; in vain have you massacred and\r\nassassinated _en masse_ like Charles IX; in vain have you done all\r\nthis, in vain have you recalled all these names to men's minds when\r\nthey think of your name,--you are nothing but a rogue. A man is not a\r\nmonster for the wishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom every agglomeration of men, from every city, from every nation,\r\nthere inevitably arises a collective force.\r\n\r\nPlace this collective force at the service of liberty, let it rule by\r\nuniversal suffrage, the city becomes a commune, the nation becomes a\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nThis collective force is not, of its nature, intelligent. Belonging to\r\nall, it belongs to no one; it floats about, so to speak, outside of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nUntil the day comes when, according to the true social formula,--_as\r\nlittle government as possible_,--this force may be reduced to a mere\r\nstreet and road police, paving the streets, lighting the lamps, and\r\nlooking after malefactors; until that day comes, this collective force,\r\nbeing at the mercy of many chances and many ambitions, needs to be\r\nguarded and protected by jealous, clear-sighted, well-armed\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIt may be subjugated by tradition, it may be surprised by stratagem.\r\n\r\nA man may rush upon it, seize it, bridle it, quell it, and cause it to\r\ntrample upon the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe tyrant is the man, who, born of tradition, like Nicholas of Russia,\r\nor of stratagem, like Louis Bonaparte, seizes for his own profit, and\r\naccording to his caprice disposes of the collective force of a people.\r\n\r\nThis man, if he be by birth what Nicholas is, is the enemy of society;\r\nif he have done what Louis Bonaparte has done, he is a public robber.\r\n\r\nThe former has no account to settle with regular legal justice, with\r\nthe articles of codes. He has behind him, spying upon and watching him,\r\nhatred in their hearts, and vengeance in their hands, Orloff in his\r\npalace, and Mouravieff among the people; he may be assassinated by one\r\nof his army, or poisoned by one of his family; he runs the risk of\r\nbarrack conspiracies, of revolts of regiments, of secret military\r\nsocieties, of domestic plots, of sudden, mysterious maladies, of\r\nterrible blows, of great catastrophes. The other ought simply to go to\r\nPoissy.\r\n\r\nThe former has the wherewithal to die in the purple, and to end his\r\nlife with pomp and royally, as monarchs end and tragedies. The other\r\nmust live; live between four walls behind bars, through which the\r\npeople can look at him, sweeping courtyards, making horse-hair brushes\r\nor list shoes, emptying buckets, with a green cap on his head, wooden\r\nshoes on his feet, and straw in his shoes.\r\n\r\nAh! ye leaders of the old parties, ye men of absolutism, in France you\r\nvoted _en masse_ among 7,500,000; outside of France you applauded,\r\ntaking this Cartouche for the hero of order. He is ferocious enough for\r\nit, I admit; but look at his size. Don't be ungrateful to your real\r\ncolossi; you have cashiered your Haynaus and your Radetzkys too\r\nprecipitately. Above all, weigh this comparison, which so naturally\r\npresents itself to the mind. What is this Mandrin of Lilliput beside\r\nNicholas, Czar, Emperor, and Pope, a power half-Bible, half-knout, who\r\ndamns and condemns, drills eight hundred thousand soldiers and two\r\nhundred thousand priests, holds in his right hand the keys of paradise,\r\nand in his left hand the keys of Siberia, and possesses, as his\r\nchattel, sixty millions of men--their souls as if he were God, their\r\nbodies as if he were the tomb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there should not be ere long a sudden, imposing, and overwhelming\r\ncatastrophe, if the present situation of the nation should be prolonged\r\nand endure, the grand injury, the fearful injury, would be the moral\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe boulevards of Paris, the streets of Paris, the rural districts and\r\nthe towns of twenty departments of France, were strewn on the 2nd of\r\nDecember with dead and dying citizens; there were seen, before their\r\nthresholds, fathers and mothers slaughtered, children sabred,\r\ndishevelled women in pools of blood, disemboweled by grape-shot; there\r\nwere seen, in the houses, suppliants massacred, some shot in heaps in\r\ntheir cellars, others despatched by the bayonet under their beds,\r\nothers struck down by a bullet on their own hearths. The impress of\r\nbloodstained hands of all sizes may be seen at this moment, here on a\r\nwall, there on a door, there in a recess; for three days after the\r\nvictory of Louis Bonaparte, Paris walked in ruddy mire; a cap full of\r\nhuman brains was hung on a tree on Boulevard des Italiens. I, who write\r\nthese lines, saw, among other victims, on the night of the 4th, near\r\nthe Mauconseil barricade, an aged white-haired man, stretched on the\r\npavement, his bosom pierced with a bayonet, his collar-bone broken; the\r\ngutter that ran beneath him bore away his blood. I saw, I touched with\r\nmy hands, I helped to undress, a poor child seven years old, killed,\r\nthey told me, on Rue Tiquetonne; he was pale, his head rolled from one\r\nshoulder to the other while they were taking off his clothes; his\r\nhalf-closed eyes were fixed and staring, and as I leaned over his\r\nhalf-opened mouth, it seemed that I could still hear him murmur\r\nfaintly, \"Mother!\"\r\n\r\nWell, there is something more heart-rending than murdered child, more\r\nlamentable than that old man shot dead, more horrible than that cap\r\nfull of human brains, more frightful than those pavements red with\r\ncarnage, more irreparable than those men and women, those fathers and\r\nthose mothers, stabbed and murdered,--it is the vanishing honour of a\r\ngreat people!\r\n\r\nAssuredly those pyramids of dead bodies which one saw in the\r\ncemeteries, after the wagons from the Champ-de-Mars had emptied their\r\ncontents; those immense open trenches, which they filled in the morning\r\nwith human bodies, making speed because of the increasing light of\r\nday,--all this was frightful; but what is still more frightful is to\r\nthink that, at this hour, the nations are in doubt; and that in their\r\neyes France, that great moral splendour, has disappeared!\r\n\r\nThat which is more heart-rending than skulls cleft by the sword, than\r\nbreasts riddled by bullets, more disastrous than houses pillaged, than\r\nmurder filling the streets, than blood shed in rivers, is to think that\r\nnow, among all the peoples of the earth, men are saying to one another:\r\n\"Do you know that that nation of nations, that people of the 14th of\r\nJuly, that people of the 10th of August, that people of 1830, that\r\npeople of 1848, that race of giants which razed bastiles, that race of\r\nmen whose faces cast a bright light, that fatherland of the human race\r\nwhich produced heroes and thinkers, those heroes who made all the\r\nrevolutions and gave birth to all births, that France whose name meant\r\nliberty, that soul of the world, so to say, which shone resplendent in\r\nEurope, that light.... Well! some one has stepped upon it, and put it\r\nout. There is no longer a France. It is at an end. Look! everywhere\r\ndarkness. The world is feeling its way.\"\r\n\r\nAh! it was so grand. Where are those times, those glorious times,\r\ninterspersed with storms, but glorious, when all was life, when all was\r\nliberty, when all was glory? those times when the French people, awake\r\nbefore all others, and up before the light, their brows illumined by\r\nthe dawn of the future already risen for them, said to the other\r\nnations, still drowsy and overborne, and scarcely able to shake their\r\nchains in their sleep: \"Fear naught, I work for all, I dig the earth\r\nfor all,--I am the workman of the Almighty!\"\r\n\r\nWhat profound grief! Regard that torpor where formerly there was such\r\npower! that shame, where formerly there was such pride! that noble\r\npeople, whose heads were once held erect and are now lowered!\r\n\r\nAlas! Louis Bonaparte has done more than kill persons, he has caused\r\nmen's minds to dwindle, he has withered the heart of the citizen. One\r\nmust belong to the race of the invincible and the indomitable, to\r\npersevere now in the rugged path of renunciation and of duty. An\r\nindescribable gangrene of material prosperity threatens to cause public\r\nhonesty to degenerate into rottenness. Oh! what happiness to be\r\nbanished, to be disgraced, to be ruined,--is it not, brave workmen? Is\r\nit not, worthy peasants, driven from France, who have no roof to\r\nshelter you, and no shoes to your feet? What happiness to eat black\r\nbread, to lie on a mattress thrown on the ground, to be out at elbows,\r\nto be away from all this, and to those who say to you: \"You are\r\nFrench!\" to answer, \"I am proscribed!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a pitiful thing is this delight of self-interest and cupidity,\r\nwallowing in the slough of the 2nd of December! Faith! let us live, let\r\nus go into business, let us speculate in zinc and railway shares, let\r\nus make money; it is degrading but it is an excellent thing; a scruple\r\nless, a louis more; let us sell our whole soul at that rate. One runs\r\nto and fro, one rushes about, one cools his heels in anterooms, one\r\ndrinks deep of every kind of shame, and if one cannot get a concession\r\nof railways in France or of lands in Africa, one asks for an office. A\r\nhost of intrepid devotions besiege the Elysée, and collect about the\r\nman. Junot, beside the first Bonaparte, defied the splashing of shells,\r\nthese fellows beside the second, defy the splashing of mud. What care\r\nthey about sharing his ignominy, provided they share his fortune? The\r\ncompetition is to see who shall carry on this traffic in himself most\r\ncynically; and among these creatures there are young men with pure\r\nlimpid eyes, and all the appearance of generous youth; and there are\r\nold men, who have but one fear, which is, that the office solicited may\r\nnot reach them in time, and that they may not succeed in dishonouring\r\nthemselves before they die. One would sell himself for a prefecture,\r\nanother for a collectorship, another for a consulate; one wants a\r\ntobacco license, another an embassy. All want money, some more, some\r\nless; for it is of the salary they think, not of the duties. Every one\r\nhas his hand out. All offer themselves. One of these days we shall have\r\nto appoint an assayer of consciences at the Mint.\r\n\r\nWhat! this is what we have come to! What! those very men who supported\r\nthe _coup d'état_, those very men who recoiled from the red\r\n_croquemitaine_ and the twaddle about Jacquerie in 1852; those very\r\nmen to whom that crime seemed a good thing, because, according to them,\r\nit rescued from peril their consols, their ledgers, their money-boxes,\r\ntheir bill-books,--even they do not comprehend that material interest,\r\nsurviving alone, would, after all, be only a melancholy waif in an\r\nimmense moral shipwreck, and that it is a fearful and monstrous\r\nsituation, when men say: \"All is saved, save honour!\"\r\n\r\nThe words independence, enfranchisement, progress, popular pride,\r\nnational pride, French greatness, may no longer be pronounced in\r\nFrance. Hush! these words make too much noise; let us walk on tiptoe,\r\nand speak low; we are in a sick man's chamber.\r\n\r\nWho is this man?--He is the chief, the master. Every one obeys\r\nhim.--Ah! every one respects him, then?--No, every one despises\r\nhim.--Oh! what a plight!\r\n\r\nAnd military honour, where is it? Let us say no more, if you please, of\r\nwhat the army did in December, but of what it is undergoing at this\r\nmoment, of that which is at its head, of that which is on its head. Do\r\nyou think of that? Does it think of that? O army of the republic! army\r\nthat had for captains, generals paid with four francs a day; army that\r\nhad for leaders, Carnot, austerity, Marceau, unselfishness, Hoche,\r\nhonour, Kléber, devotion, Joubert, probity, Desaix, valour, Bonaparte,\r\ngenius! O, French army, poor, unfortunate, heroic army, gone astray in\r\nthe train of these men! What will they do with it? whither will they\r\nlead it? how will they occupy it? what parodies are we destined to see\r\nand hear? Alas! what are these men who command our regiments, and who\r\ngovern us? The master--we know him. This fellow, who had been a\r\nminister, was going to be \"seized\" on the 3rd of December; it was for\r\nthat reason he _made_ the 2nd. That other is the \"borrower\" of the\r\ntwenty-five millions from the Bank. That other is the man of the gold\r\ningots. To that other, before he was made minister, \"a friend\"\r\nsaid:--\"_I say! you are humbugging us about the shares in that affair;\r\nthat won't go down with me. If there's any swindling going on, let me\r\nat least have a finger in it._\" That other, who wears epaulettes, has\r\njust been convicted of selling mortgaged property; that other, who also\r\nwears epaulettes, received, on the morning of the 2nd of December,\r\n100,000 francs, for \"emergencies.\" He was only a colonel; if he had\r\nbeen a general he would have had more. This man, who is a general, when\r\nhe was a body-guard of Louis XVIII, being on duty behind the king's\r\nchair during mass, cut a gold tassel from the throne and put it in his\r\npocket; he was expelled from the guards for that. Surely, to these men,\r\nalso, we might rear a column, _ex aere capto_, with the money they\r\nstole. This other, who is a general of division, \"converted\" 52,000\r\nfrancs, to the knowledge of Colonel Caharras, in the construction of\r\nthe villages of Saint André and Saint Hippolyte, near Mascara. This\r\none, who is general-in-chief, was christened at Ghent, where he is\r\nknown, _le général Cinq-cents-francs_. This one, who is Minister of\r\nWar, has only General Rulhière's clemency to thank that he was not sent\r\nbefore a court-martial. Such are the men. No matter; forward! beat,\r\ndrums, sound, trumpets, wave, flags! Soldiers, from the top of yon\r\npyramids the forty thieves look down upon you!\r\n\r\nLet us go farther into this mournful subject, and survey it in all its\r\naspects.\r\n\r\nThe mere spectacle of fortune like that of M. Bonaparte, placed at the\r\nhead of the state, would suffice to demoralize a people.\r\n\r\nThere is always, and it is the fault of our social institutions, that\r\nought, above all, to enlighten and civilize, there is always, in a\r\nlarge population like that of France, a class which is ignorant, which\r\nsuffers, covets, and struggles, placed between the brutish instinct\r\nwhich impels it to take, and the moral law which invites it to labour.\r\nIn the grievous and oppressed condition in which it still is, this\r\nclass, in order to maintain itself in probity and well-doing, requires\r\nall the pure and holy light that emanates from the Gospel; it requires\r\nthat, on the one hand, the spirit of Jesus Christ, and, on the other,\r\nthe spirit of the French Revolution, should address to it the same\r\nmanly words, and should never cease to point out to it, as the only\r\nlights worthy of the eyes of man, the exalted and mysterious laws of\r\nhuman destiny,--self-denial, devotion, sacrifice, the labour which\r\nleads to material well-being, the probity which leads to inward\r\nwell-being; even with this perennial instruction, at once divine and\r\nhuman, this class, so worthy of sympathy and fraternity, often\r\nsuccumbs. Suffering and temptation are stronger than virtue. Now do you\r\ncomprehend the infamous counsel which the success of M. Bonaparte gives\r\nto this class?\r\n\r\nA poor man, in rags, without money, without work, is there in the\r\nshadow, at the corner of the street, seated on a stone; he is\r\nmeditating, and at the same time repelling, a bad action; now he\r\nwavers, now he recovers himself; he is starving, and feels a desire to\r\nrob; to rob he must make a false key, he must scale a wall; then, the\r\nkey made and the wall scaled, he will stand before the strong box; if\r\nany one wakes, if any one resists, he must kill. His hair stands on\r\nend, his eyes become haggard, his conscience, the voice of God, revolts\r\nwithin him, and cries to him: \"Stop! this is evil! these are crimes!\"\r\nAt that moment the head of the state passes by; the man sees M.\r\nBonaparte in his uniform of a general, with the _cordon rouge_, and\r\nwith footmen in gold-laced liveries, dashing towards his palace in a\r\ncarriage drawn by four horses; the unhappy wretch, hesitating before\r\nhis crime, greedily gazes on this splendid vision; and the serenity of\r\nM. Bonaparte, and his gold epaulettes, and his _cordon rouge_, and\r\nthe liveries, and the palace, and the four-horse carriage, say to him:\r\n\"Succeed.\"\r\n\r\nHe attaches himself to this apparition, he follows it, he runs to the\r\nÉlysée; a gilded mob rushes in after the prince. All sorts of carriages\r\npass under that portal, and he has glimpses of happy, radiant men! This\r\none is an ambassador; the ambassador looks at him, and says: \"Succeed.\"\r\nThis is a bishop; the bishop looks at him and says: \"Succeed.\" This is\r\na judge; the judge looks at him, and smiles on him, and says:\r\n\"Succeed.\"\r\n\r\nThus, to escape the gendarmes,--therein consists henceforth the whole\r\nmoral law. To rob, to pillage, to poignard, to assassinate, all this is\r\ncriminal only when one is fool enough to allow himself to be caught.\r\nEvery man who meditates a crime has a constitution to violate, an oath\r\nto break, an obstacle to destroy. In a word, take your measures well.\r\nBe adroit. Succeed. The only guilty actions are the _coups_ that fail.\r\n\r\nYou put your hand in the pocket of a passer-by, in the evening, at\r\nnightfall, in a lonely place; he seizes you; you let go; he arrests\r\nyou, and takes you to the guard-house. You are guilty; to the galleys!\r\nYou do not let go: you have a knife about you, you bury it in the man's\r\nthroat; he falls; he is dead; now take his purse, and make off. Bravo!\r\ncapitally done! You have shut the victim's mouth, the only witness who\r\ncould speak. Nobody has anything to say to you.\r\n\r\nIf you had only robbed the man, you would have been in the wrong; kill\r\nhim, and you are right.\r\n\r\nSucceed, that is the point.\r\n\r\nAh! this is indeed alarming!\r\n\r\nOn the day when the human conscience shall lose its bearings, on the\r\nday when success shall carry the day before that forum, all will be at\r\nan end. The last moral gleam will reascend to heaven. Darkness will be\r\nin the mind of man. You will have nothing to do but to devour one\r\nanother, wild beasts that you are!\r\n\r\nWith moral degradation goes political degradation. M. Bonaparte treats\r\nthe people of France like a conquered country. He effaces the\r\nrepublican inscriptions; he cut down the trees of liberty, and makes\r\nfirewood of them. There was on Place Bourgogne a statue of the\r\nRepublic; he puts the pickaxe to it; there was on our coinage a figure\r\nof the Republic, crowned with ears of corn; M. Bonaparte replaces it by\r\nthe profile of M. Bonaparte. He has his bust crowned and harangued in\r\nthe market-places, just as the tyrant Gessler made the people salute\r\nhis cap. The rustics in the faubourgs were in the habit of singing in\r\nchorus, in the evening, as they returned from work; they used to sing\r\nthe great republican songs, the Marseillaise, the Chant du Depart; they\r\nwere ordered to keep silent; the faubourgers will sing no more; there\r\nis amnesty only for obscenities and drunken songs. The triumph is so\r\ncomplete, that they no longer keep within bounds. Only yesterday they\r\nkept in hiding, they did their shooting at night; it was shocking, but\r\nthere was still some shame; there was a remnant of respect for the\r\npeople; they seemed to think that it had still enough life in it to\r\nrevolt, if it saw such things. Now they show themselves, they fear\r\nnothing, they guillotine in broad day. Whom do they guillotine? Whom?\r\nthe men of the law, and the law is there! Whom? the men of the people!\r\nand the people is there! Nor is this all. There is a man in Europe, who\r\nhorrifies Europe: that man sacked Lombardy, he set up the gibbets of\r\nHungary; he had a woman whipped under the gibbet upon which hung her\r\nhusband and her son; we still remember the terrible letter in which\r\nthat woman recounts the deed, and says: \"My heart has turned to stone.\"\r\n\r\nLast year this man took it into his head to visit England as a tourist,\r\nand, while in London, he took it into his head to visit a brewery, that\r\nof Barclay and Perkins. There he was recognized; a voice whispered: \"It\r\nis Haynau!\"--\"It is Haynau!\" repeated the workmen!--It was a fearful\r\ncry; the crowd rushed upon the wretch, tore out his infamous white hair\r\nby handfuls, spat in his face, and thrust him out. Well, this old\r\nbandit in epaulettes, this Haynau, this man who still bears on his\r\ncheek the immense buffet of the English people, it is announced that\r\n\"Monseigneur the Prince-President invites him to visit France.\" It is\r\nquite right; London put an affront on him, Paris owes him an ovation.\r\nIt is a reparation. Be it so. We will be there to see. Haynau was\r\ncursed and hooted at the brewery of Barclay and Perkins, he will\r\nreceive bouquets at the brewery of Saint-Antoine. The Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine will receive an order to conduct itself properly. The\r\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, mute, motionless, impassive, will see them\r\npass, triumphant and conversing together, like two friends, through its\r\nold revolutionary streets, one in French, the other in Austrian\r\nuniform,--Louis Bonaparte, the murderer of the boulevard, arm-in-arm\r\nwith Haynau, the whipper of women! Go on, add insult to insult,\r\ndisfigure this France of ours, fallen flat on the pavement! make her\r\nunrecognizable! crush the faces of the people with your heels!\r\n\r\nOh! inspire me, seek for me, give me, invent for me a means, whatever\r\nit may be, short of a poignard, which I repudiate,--a Brutus for that\r\nman! bah! he is not worthy of even a Louvel!--find me some means of\r\nlaying that man low, and of delivering my country! of laying that man\r\nlow, that man of craft, that man of lies, that man of success, that man\r\nof evil! Some means, the first that offers,--pen, sword, paving-stone,\r\n_émeute_,--by the people, by the soldier; yes, whatever it be, so it be\r\nhonourable, and in open day, I take it, we all take it, we proscribed,\r\nif it can re-establish liberty, set free the republic, deliver our\r\ncountry from shame, and drive back to his dust, to his oblivion, to\r\nhis cloaca, this imperial ruffian, this prince pick-pocket, this gypsy\r\nking, this traitor, this master, this groom of Franconi's! this\r\nradiant, imperturbable, self-satisfied governor, crowned with his\r\nsuccessful crime, who goes and comes, and peacefully parades trembling\r\nParis, and who has everything on his side,--the Bourse, the\r\nshopkeepers, the magistracy, all influences, all guarantees, all\r\ninvocations, from the _Nom de Dieu_ of the soldier to the Te Deum of\r\nthe priest!\r\n\r\nReally, when one has fixed one's eyes too long on certain aspects of\r\nthis spectacle, even the strongest minds are attacked with vertigo.\r\n\r\nBut does he, at least, do himself justice, this Bonaparte? Has he a\r\nglimmering, an idea, a suspicion, the slightest perception, of his\r\ninfamy? Really, one is driven to doubt it.\r\n\r\nYes, sometimes, from the lofty words he uses, when one hears him make\r\nincredible appeals to posterity, to that posterity which will shudder\r\nwith horror and wrath at him; when one hears him speak coolly of his\r\n\"legitimacy,\" and his \"mission,\" one is almost tempted to think that he\r\nhas come to take himself into high consideration, and that his head is\r\nturned to such a degree that he no longer perceives what he is, nor\r\nwhat he does. He believes in the adhesion of the poor, he believes in\r\nthe good-will of kings, he believes in the fête of eagles, he believes\r\nin the harangues of the Council of State, he believes in the\r\nbenedictions of the bishops, he believes in the oath that he has forced\r\npeople to take, he believes in the 7,500,000 votes!\r\n\r\nHe is talking now, feeling in the humour of Augustus, of granting\r\namnesty to the proscribed. Usurpation granting amnesty to right!\r\ntreason to honour! cowardice to courage! crime to virtue! He is to that\r\ndegree embruted by his success that he thinks this all very simple.\r\n\r\nSingular effect of intoxication! Optical illusion! In his eyes that\r\nthing of the 14th of January appears all golden and glorious and\r\nradiant, that constitution defiled with mud, stained with blood, laden\r\nwith chains, dragged amid the hooting of Europe by the police, the\r\nSenate, the Corps Législatif and the Council of State, all newly shod.\r\nHe takes as a triumphal car, and would drive under the Arc de l'Étoile,\r\nthat sledge, standing on which, hideous, with whip in hand, he parades\r\nthe ensanguined corpse of the republic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION--PART SECOND\r\n\r\nFAITH AND AFFLICTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nProvidence brings to maturity men, things, and events, by the single\r\nfact of universal life. To cause the disappearance of an old world it\r\nis sufficient that civilization, ascending majestically towards its\r\nsolstice, should shine upon old institutions, upon old prejudices, upon\r\nold laws, and upon old customs. This radiation burns and devours the\r\npast. Civilization enlightens, this is the visible fact; and at the\r\nsame time it consumes, this is the mysterious fact. Under its\r\ninfluence, gradually and without a shock, that which should decline\r\ndeclines, and what should grow old grows old; wrinkles appear upon\r\nthings condemned, on castes, on codes, on institutions, and on\r\nreligions. This work of decrepitude is, in some sort, self-acting. A\r\nfruitful decrepitude, under which germinates the new life. Little by\r\nlittle the ruin progresses; deep crevices, which are not visible,\r\nramify in the darkness, and internally reduce to powder the venerable\r\nstructure, which still appears a solid mass without; and suddenly, some\r\nfine day, this ancient _ensemble_ of worm-eaten things, of which\r\ndecaying societies are composed, becomes shapeless, the nails come out,\r\nthe structure becomes disjointed, and overhangs. Then it no longer has\r\nany solidity. Let one of those giants peculiar to revolutions appear;\r\nlet him raise his hand, and all is said. There was a moment in history\r\nwhen a nudge of Danton's elbow would have shaken all Europe to its\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nThe year 1848 was such a moment. Ancient Europe, feudal, papal, and\r\nmonarchical, replastered so disastrously for France, in 1815, tottered.\r\nBut there was no Danton. The crash did not take place.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said, in the commonplace phraseology used on similar\r\noccasions, that 1848 opened a gulf. Not at all. The corpse of the past\r\nlay upon Europe; it lies there still at this moment. The year 1848\r\nopened a grave wherein to throw that corpse. It is this grave that has\r\nbeen taken for a gulf.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 all that still held to the past, all that still survived of the\r\nbody, had a close view of this grave. Not only the kings upon their\r\nthrones, the cardinals under their hats, the judges in the shadow of\r\ntheir guillotines, the captains on their war-horses, were thrown into\r\ncommotion; but he who had any interest whatever in what was about to\r\ndisappear; he who was cultivating for his own profit a social fiction,\r\nand had an abuse to let out on hire; he who was guardian of some\r\nfalsehood, doorkeeper of some prejudice, or farmer of some\r\nsuperstition; he who was taking advantage of another, or dealing in\r\nusury, oppression and falsehood; he who sold by false weights, from\r\nthose who falsify a balance to those who falsify the Bible; from the\r\ncheating merchant to the cheating priest; from those who manipulate\r\nfigures to those who traffic in miracles,--all, from the Jew banker who\r\nfeels that he is more or less Catholic, to the bishop who becomes more\r\nor less of a Jew,--all the men of the past inclined their heads towards\r\none another and trembled.\r\n\r\nThis grave, which was gaping, and into which had nearly fallen all the\r\nfictions--their treasure--which have weighed upon men for so many ages,\r\nthey resolved to fill up. They determined to wall it up, to pile rocks\r\nand stones upon it, and to erect upon the pile a gibbet, and to hang\r\nupon this gibbet, all bleeding and dejected, that mighty culprit,\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nThey determined, once for all, to make an end of the spirit of freedom\r\nand emancipation, and to drive back and repress for ever the upward\r\ntendency of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise was formidable. What the nature of it was we have\r\nalready indicated, more than once, in this book and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo undo the labour of twenty generations; to kill in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, by strangulation, three centuries, the sixteenth, the\r\nseventeenth, and the eighteenth, that is to say, Luther, Descartes, and\r\nVoltaire, religious scrutiny, philosophical scrutiny, universal\r\nscrutiny; to crush throughout all Europe this immense vegetation of\r\nfree thought, here a tender blade, there a sturdy oak; to marry the\r\nknout and the holy-water-sprinkler; to put more of Spain in the South,\r\nand more of Russia in the North; to resuscitate all they could of the\r\nInquisition, and to stifle all they could of intelligence; to stultify\r\nyouth, in other words to brutalize the future; to make the world a\r\nwitness of the _auto-da-fé_ of ideas; to throw down the tribune, to\r\nsuppress the newspaper, the placard, the book, the spoken word, the\r\ncry, the whisper, the breath; to make silence; to pursue thought into\r\nthe case of the printer, into the composing-stick, into the leaden\r\ntype, into the stereotype, into the lithograph, into the drawing, upon\r\nthe stage, into the street-show, into the mouth of the actor, into the\r\ncopy-book of the schoolmaster, into the hawker's pack; to hold out to\r\neach man, for faith, for law, for aim in life, and for God, his selfish\r\ninterest; to say to nations: \"Eat and think no more;\" to take man from\r\nthe brain, and put him in the belly; to extinguish individual initiative,\r\nlocal life, national impulse, all those deep-rooted instincts which\r\nimpel man to that which is right; to annihilate that _ego_ of nations\r\nwhich is called the fatherland; to destroy nationality among\r\npartitioned and dismembered peoples, constitutions in constitutional\r\nstates, the republic in France, and liberty everywhere; to plant the\r\nfoot everywhere upon human effort.\r\n\r\nIn one word, to close that abyss which is called Progress.\r\n\r\nSuch was the plan, vast, enormous, European, which no one conceived,\r\nfor not one of those men of the old world had had genius for it, but\r\nwhich all followed. As for the plan in itself, as for that\r\nall-embracing idea of universal repression, whence came it? who could\r\ntell? It was seen in the air. It appeared in the past. It enlightened\r\ncertain souls, it pointed to certain routes. It was a gleam issuing\r\nfrom the tomb of Machiavelii.\r\n\r\nAt certain moments of human history, from the things which are plotted\r\nand the things which are done, it would seem that all the old demons of\r\nhumanity, Louis XI, Philip II, Catherine de Medicis, the Duke of Alva,\r\nTorquemada, are somewhere or other in a corner, seated around a table,\r\nand taking counsel together.\r\n\r\nWe look, we search, and instead of the colossi, we find abortions.\r\nWhere we expected to see the Duke of Alva, we find Schwartzenberg;\r\nwhere we expected to see Torquemada we find Veuillot. The old European\r\ndespotism continues its march, with these little men, and goes on and\r\non; it resembles the Czar Peter when travelling:--\"_We relay with\r\nwhat we can find,\" he wrote; \"_when we had no more Tartar horses, we\r\ntook donkeys.\" To attain this object, the repression of everything and\r\neverybody, it was necessary to pursue an obscure, tortuous, rugged,\r\ndifficult path; they pursued it. Some of those who entered it, knew\r\nwhat they were doing.\r\n\r\nParties are kept alive by watchwords; those men, those ringleaders,\r\nwhom 1848 frightened and assembled, had, as we have said above, adopted\r\ntheirs: religion, family, property. With that commonplace adroitness\r\nwhich suffices when one speaks to fear, they exploited certain obscure\r\naspects of what was called socialism. It was a question of \"saving\r\nreligion, property, and the family.\"--\"Save the flag!\" they exclaimed.\r\nThe vulgar herd of terrified selfish interests threw themselves into\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nThey coalesced, they made a stand, they formed in mass. They had a\r\ncrowd around them. This crowd was composed of diverse elements. The\r\nlanded proprietor entered it because his rents had fallen; the peasant,\r\nbecause he had paid the forty-five centimes; he who did not believe in\r\nGod thought it necessary to save religion, because he had been forced\r\nto sell his horses. They extracted from this crowd the force it\r\ncontained, and made use of it. They made everything contribute to\r\nrepression: the law, despotism, the assemblies, the tribune, the jury,\r\nthe magistracy, the police; in Lombardy the sabre, at Naples the\r\nconvict prison, in Hungary the gibbet. To remuzzle men's intellects, to\r\nreplace the fetters on men's minds, these runaway slaves, to prevent\r\nthe past from disappearing, to prevent the future from being born, to\r\nremain kings, powerful, privileged and happy, all means were good, all\r\njust, all legitimate. For the exigencies of the struggle, they\r\nmanufactured and spread throughout the world a sort of ambuscade-morality\r\nagainst liberty, which Ferdinand put in action at Palermo, Antonelli at\r\nRome, Schwartzenberg at Milan and at Pesth, and later, at Paris, those\r\nwolves of state, the men of December.\r\n\r\nThere was a nation among the nations, which was a sort of elder brother\r\nin this family of the oppressed, a prophet in the human tribe. This\r\nnation took the initiative of the whole human movement. It went on,\r\nsaying, \"Come!\" and the rest followed. As a complement to the\r\nfraternity of men, in the Gospel, it taught the fraternity of nations.\r\nIt spoke by the voice of its writers, of its poets, of its\r\nphilosophers, of its orators, as by a single mouth, and its words flew\r\nto the extremities of the earth, to rest, like tongues of fire, upon\r\nthe brow of all nations. It presided over the communion of intellects.\r\nIt multiplied the bread of life to those who were wandering in the\r\ndesert. One day it was enveloped in a tempest; it marched over the\r\nabyss, and said to the frightened nations: \"Why are you afraid?\" The\r\nwave of the revolutions it had excited subsided under its footsteps,\r\nand, far from engulfing it, increased its glory. The suffering, infirm,\r\nand diseased nations pressed around it; one was limping, for the chain\r\nof the Inquisition, riveted to its foot for three centuries, had lamed\r\nit; to this one it said, \"Walk!\" and it walked. Another was blind, the\r\nold Roman papistry had filled its eyes with mist and darkness; to this\r\none it said, \"Receive thy sight!\" it opened its eyes and saw. \"Throw\r\naway your crutches, that is to say, your prejudices,\" it said; \"throw\r\naway your bandages, that is to say, your superstitions; stand upright,\r\nraise your head, look at the sky, look at God. The future is yours. O\r\nnations! you have a leprosy, ignorance; you have a plague, fanaticism;\r\nthere is not one of you but is afflicted with that frightful malady\r\ncalled a despot; go, march, break the bonds of evil; I deliver you, I\r\ncure you!\" Throughout the earth a grateful clamour arose among the\r\nnations which these words made sound and strong. One day it accosted\r\ndead Poland; it raised its finger, and exclaimed, \"Arise!\" and dead\r\nPoland arose.\r\n\r\nThis nation, the men of the past, whose fall it announced, dreaded and\r\nhated. By dint of stratagem, of tortuous patience, and of audacity,\r\nthey ended by seizing it, and succeeded in throttling it.\r\n\r\nFor three years and more, the world has witnessed a tremendous agony\r\nand a frightful spectacle. For three years and more, the men of the\r\npast, the scribes, the Pharisees, the publicans, the princes of the\r\npriests, have crucified, in presence of the human race, the Christ of\r\nnations, the French people. Some furnished the cross, others the nails,\r\nothers the hammer. Falloux placed upon its forehead the crown of\r\nthorns. Montalembert placed upon its mouth the sponge, dipped in gall\r\nand vinegar. Louis Bonaparte is the miserable soldier who struck his\r\nlance into its side, and caused it to utter the supreme cry: _Eli!\r\nEli! Lama Sabachthani_!\r\n\r\nNow it is all over. The French nation is dead. The great tomb is about\r\nto open.\r\n\r\nFor three days!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us have faith.\r\n\r\nNo, let us not be cast down. To despair is to desert.\r\n\r\nLet us look to the future.\r\n\r\nThe future,--no one knows what tempests still separate us from port,\r\nbut the port, the distant and radiant port, is in sight; the future, we\r\nrepeat, is the republic for all men; let us add, the future is peace\r\nwith all men.\r\n\r\nLet us not fall into the vulgar error, which is to curse and to\r\ndishonour the age in which we live. Erasmus called the sixteenth\r\ncentury \"the excrement of the ages,\" _fex temporum_. Bossuet thus\r\nqualified the seventeenth century: \"A wicked and paltry age.\" Rousseau\r\nbranded the eighteenth century, in these terms: \"This great rottenness\r\namidst which we live.\" Posterity has proved these illustrious men in\r\nthe wrong. It has said to Erasmus: \"The sixteenth century was great;\"\r\nit has said to Bossuet: \"The seventeenth century was great;\" it has\r\nsaid to Rousseau: \"The eighteenth century was great.\"\r\n\r\nEven had the infamy of those ages been actual, those great men would\r\nhave been wrong to complain. The man who thinks should accept simply\r\nand calmly the surroundings in which Providence has placed him. The\r\nsplendour of human intelligence, the loftiness of genius, shine no less\r\nby contrast than by harmony with the age. The stoic and profound\r\nphilosopher is not diminished by an external debasement. Virgil,\r\nPetrarch, Racine are great in their purple; Job is still greater on his\r\ndunghill.\r\n\r\nBut we can say, we men of the nineteenth century, that the nineteenth\r\ncentury is not the dunghill. However deep the shame of the present,\r\nwhatever blows we receive from the fluctuation of events, whatever the\r\napparent desertion or the momentary lethargy of mental vigour, none of\r\nus, democrats, will repudiate the magnificent epoch in which we live,\r\nthe virile age of mankind.\r\n\r\nLet us proclaim it aloud, let us proclaim it in our fall and in our\r\ndefeat, this is the greatest of all ages! and do you know the reason\r\nwhy? because it is the mildest. This age, the immediate issue, the\r\nfirstborn offspring, of the French Revolution, frees the slave in\r\nAmerica, raises from his degradation the _pariah_ in Asia, abolishes\r\nthe suttee in India, and extinguishes in Europe the last brands of the\r\nstake, civilizes Turkey, carries the Gospel into the domain of the\r\nKoran, dignifies woman, subordinates the right of the strongest to that\r\nof the most just, suppresses pirates, mitigates sentences, makes the\r\ngalleys healthy, throws the red-hot iron into the sewer, condemns the\r\npenalty of death, removes the ball and chain from the leg of the\r\nconvict, abolishes torture, degrades and brands war, stifles Dukes of\r\nAlva and Charles the Ninths, and extracts the claws of tyrants.\r\n\r\nThis age proclaims the sovereignty of the citizen, and the\r\ninviolability of life; it crowns the people, and consecrates man.\r\n\r\nIn art, it possesses all varieties of genius,--writers, orators, poets,\r\nhistorians, publicists, philosophers, painters, sculptors, musicians;\r\nmajesty, grace, power, force, splendour, colour, form, style; it renews\r\nits strength in the real and in the ideal, and bears in its hand the\r\ntwo thunderbolts, the true and the beautiful. In science it\r\naccomplishes unheard-of miracles; it makes of cotton saltpetre, of\r\nsteam a horse, of the voltaic battery a workman, of the electric fluid\r\na messenger, of the sun a painter; it waters itself with subterranean\r\nstreams, pending the time when it shall warm itself with the central\r\nfire; it opens upon the two infinites those two windows, the telescope\r\nupon the infinitely great, the microscope upon the infinitely little,\r\nand it finds stars in the first abyss, and insects in the second, which\r\nprove to it the existence of God. It annihilates time, it annihilates\r\nspace, it annihilates suffering; it writes a letter from Paris to\r\nLondon, and has an answer in ten minutes; it cuts off a man's leg, the\r\nman sings and smiles.\r\n\r\nIt has now only to realize--and it has nearly done it--a progress which\r\nis nothing compared to the miracles it has already wrought; it has only\r\nto find the means of directing through a mass of air a bubble of\r\nlighter air; it has already obtained the bubble of air, and keeps it\r\nimprisoned; it has now only to find the impulsive force, only to cause\r\na vacuum before the balloon, for instance, only to burn the air before\r\nthe aerostat, as the rocket does before itself; it has only to solve\r\nthis problem in some way or other; and it will solve it, and do you\r\nknow what will happen then? At that instant frontiers will vanish, all\r\nbarriers will be swept away; everything that constitutes a Chinese wall\r\nround thought, round commerce, round industry, round nationalities,\r\nround progress, will crumble; in spite of censorships, in spite of\r\n_index expurgatorius_, it will rain books and journals upon every\r\ncountry under the sun; Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, will fall like hail\r\nupon Rome, Naples, Vienna, St. Petersburg; the human word is manna, and\r\nthe serf will gather it in the furrows; fanaticism will die, oppression\r\nwill be impossible; man dragged himself along the ground,--he will\r\nescape; civilization changes itself into a flock of birds, and flies\r\naway, and whirls about and alights joyously at the same moment upon\r\nevery point of the globe. Lo! yonder it passes; aim your cannons, old\r\ndespotisms, it disdains you; you are only the bullet, it is the\r\nlightning; no more hatreds, no more mutually devouring interests, no\r\nmore wars; a sort of new life, composed of concord and light, pervades\r\nand soothes the world; the fraternity of nations soars through space,\r\nand holds communion in the eternal azure; men mingle in the skies.\r\n\r\nWhile we await this final progress, let us consider the point to which\r\nthis age had brought civilization.\r\n\r\nFormerly there was a world in which people walked slowly, with bent\r\nback, and eyes cast down; in which the Comte de Gouvon was served at\r\ntable by Jean-Jacques; in which the Chevalier de Rohan belaboured\r\nVoltaire with a stick; in which Daniel Defoe was placed in the pillory;\r\nin which a city like Dijon was separated from a city like Paris by the\r\nnecessity of making one's will, by robbers at every corner, and ten\r\ndays by stage; in which a book was a sort of infamy and filth which the\r\nhangman burned upon the steps of the Palais de Justice; in which\r\nsuperstition and ferocity shook hands; in which the Pope said to the\r\nEmperor: \"_Jungamus dexteras, gladium gladio copulemus_;\" in which\r\none met at every step crosses hung with amulets, and gibbets hung with\r\nmen; in which there were heretics, Jews, and lepers; in which houses\r\nhad battlements and loop-holes; in which streets were closed with a\r\nchain, rivers with a chain, and even camps with a chain (as at the\r\nbattle of Tolosa), cities with walls, kingdoms with prohibitions and\r\npenalties; in which, with the exception of force and authority, which\r\nstuck tightly together, everything was penned up, distributed, divided,\r\ncut into fragments, hated and hating, scattered and dead; men were as\r\ndust, power a solid block. But now we have a world in which everything\r\nis alive, united, combined, coupled, mingled together; a world in which\r\nthought, commerce, and industry reign; in which politics, more and more\r\nfirmly fixed, tends to an intimate union with science; a world in which\r\nthe last scaffolds and the last cannon are hastening to cut off their\r\nlast heads and to vomit forth their last shells; a world in which light\r\nincreases every instant; a world in which distance has disappeared, in\r\nwhich Constantinople is nearer to Paris than Lyons was a hundred years\r\nago, in which Europe and America pulsate with the same heart-throb; a\r\nworld all circulation and all love, of which France is the brain, the\r\nrailroads the arteries, and the electric wires the fibres. Do you not\r\nsee that simply to set forth such a state of affairs is to explain, to\r\ndemonstrate, and to solve everything? Do you not feel that the old\r\nworld had an aged soul, tyranny, and that into the new world is about\r\nto descend, necessarily, irresistibly, and divinely, a youthful soul,\r\nliberty?\r\n\r\nThis was the work that the nineteenth century had done among men, and\r\nwas continuing in glorious, fashion to do,--that century of sterility,\r\nthat century of domination, that century of decadence, that century of\r\ndegradation, as it is called by the pedants, the rhetoricians, the\r\nimbeciles, and all that filthy brood of bigots, of knaves, and of\r\nsharpers, who sanctimoniously slaver gall upon glory, who assert that\r\nPascal was a madman, Voltaire a coxcomb, and Rousseau a brute, and\r\nwhose triumph it would be to put a fool's-cap upon the human race.\r\n\r\nYou speak of the Lower Empire; are you serious? Had the Lower Empire\r\nbehind it John Huss, Luther, Cervantes, Shakespere, Pascal, Molière,\r\nVoltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Mirabeau? Had the Lower Empire\r\nbehind it the taking of the Bastile, the Federation, Danton,\r\nRobespierre, the Convention? Did the Lower Empire possess America? Had\r\nthe Lower Empire universal suffrage? Had the Lower Empire those two\r\nideas, country and humanity: country which enlarges the heart, humanity\r\nwhich expands the horizon? Do you know that, under the Lower Empire,\r\nConstantinople fell in ruins, and finally had only thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants? Has Paris fallen so low? Because you have witnessed the\r\nsuccess of a pretorian _coup de main_, you liken yourselves to the\r\nLower Empire! 'Tis quickly said, and meanly thought. But reflect, if\r\nyou can. Had the Lower Empire the compass, the electric battery, the\r\nprinting press, the newspaper, the locomotive, the electric telegraph?\r\nSo many wings to bear man aloft, which the Lower Empire did not\r\npossess! The nineteenth century soars, where the Lower Empire crawled.\r\nAre you aware of this? What! Shall we see once more the Empress Zoé,\r\nRoman Argyrio, Nicephorus Logothetes, Michael Calafates? Nonsense! Do\r\nyou imagine that Providence repeats itself so tamely? Do you believe\r\nthat God keeps repeating himself?\r\n\r\nLet us have faith! Let us speak with decision! Self-irony is the\r\nbeginning of baseness. It is by speaking with decision that we become\r\ngood, that we become great. Yes, the enfranchisement of intellects, and\r\nthe consequent enfranchisement of nations, this was the sublime task\r\nthat the nineteenth century was performing in conjunction with France;\r\nfor the twofold providential work of the time and of men, of maturation\r\nand of action, was blended in the common labour, and the great epoch\r\nhad for its true home the great nation.\r\n\r\nO my country! it is at this moment, when I see you bleeding, inanimate,\r\nyour head hanging, your eyes closed, your mouth open, and no words\r\nissuing therefrom, the marks of the whip upon your shoulders, the nails\r\nof the executioner's shoes imprinted upon your body, naked and ashamed,\r\nand like a thing deprived of life, an object of hatred, of derision,\r\nalas! it is at this moment, my country, that the heart of the exile\r\noverflows with love and respect for you!\r\n\r\nYou lie there motionless. The minions of despotism and oppression\r\nlaugh, and enjoy the haughty illusion that you are no longer to be\r\nfeared. Fleeting joy! The peoples that are in the dark forget the past;\r\nthey see only the present, and despise you. Forgive them, they know not\r\nwhat they do. Despise you! Great Heaven! despise France? And who are\r\nthey? What language do they speak? What books have they in their hands?\r\nWhat names do they know by heart? What is the placard pasted on the\r\nwalls of their theatres? What forms do their arts assume, their laws,\r\ntheir manners, their clothing, their pleasures, their fashions? What is\r\nthe great date for them, as for us? '89! If they take France from out\r\ntheir hearts, what remains to them? O my people! Though it be fallen\r\nand fallen for ever, is Greece despised? Is Italy despised? Is France\r\ndespised? Look at those breasts, they are your nurse; look at that\r\nwomb, it is your mother.\r\n\r\nIf she sleeps, if she is in a lethargy, silence, and off with your hat.\r\nIf she is dead, to your knees!\r\n\r\nThe exiles are scattered; destiny has blasts which disperse men like a\r\nhandful of ashes. Some are in Belgium, in Piedmont, in Switzerland,\r\nwhere they do not enjoy liberty; others are in London, where they have\r\nno roof to shelter them. One, a peasant, has been torn from his native\r\nfield; another, a soldier, has only a fragment of his sword, which was\r\nbroken in his hand; another, an artisan, is ignorant of the language of\r\nthe country, he is without clothes and without shoes, he knows not if\r\nhe shall eat food to-morrow; another has left behind him a wife and\r\nchildren, a dearly loved group, the object of his labour, and the joy\r\nof his life; another has an old mother with grey hairs, who weeps for\r\nhim; another an old father, who will die without seeing him again;\r\nanother is a lover,--he has left behind him some adored being, who will\r\nforget him; they raise their heads and they hold out their hands to one\r\nanother; they smile; there is no nation that does not stand aside with\r\nrespect as they pass, and contemplate with profound emotion, as one of\r\nthe noblest spectacles which destiny can offer to men, all those serene\r\nconsciences, all those broken hearts.\r\n\r\nThey suffer and are silent; in them the citizen has sacrificed the man;\r\nthey look with firmness on adversity, they do not cry out even under\r\nthe pitiless rod of misfortune: _Civis Romanus sum!_ But at eve, when\r\none dreams,--when everything in the strange city of the stranger is\r\ninvolved in melancholy, for what seems cold by day becomes funereal in\r\ntwilight,--but at night, when sleep does not close one's eyes, hearts\r\nthe most stoical open to mourning and dejection. Where are the little\r\nones? who will give them bread? who will give them their father's kiss?\r\nwhere is the wife? where is the mother? where is the brother? where are\r\nthey all? And the songs which at eventide they used to hear, in their\r\nnative tongue, where are they? where is the wood, the tree, the forest\r\npath, the roof filled with nests, the church tower surrounded by tombs?\r\nWhere is the street, the faubourg, the lamp burning bright before the\r\ndoor, the friends, the workshop, the trade, the customary toil? And the\r\nfurniture put up for sale, the auction invading the domestic sanctuary!\r\nOh! these eternal adieux! Destroyed, dead, thrown to the four winds,\r\nthat moral existence which is called the family hearth, and which is\r\ncomposed not only of loving converse, of caresses and embraces, but of\r\nhours, of habits, of friendly visits, of joyous laughter, of the\r\npressure of the hand, of the view from certain windows, of the position\r\nof certain furniture, of the arm-chair where the grandsire used to sit,\r\nof the carpet on which the first-born used to play! Flown away for ever\r\nare those objects which bore the imprint of one's daily life! Vanished\r\nare the visible forms of one's souvenirs! There are in grief private\r\nand secret recesses, where the most lofty courage bends. The Roman\r\norator put forth his head without flinching to the knife of the\r\ncenturion Lenas, but he wept when he thought of his house demolished by\r\nClodius.\r\n\r\nThe exiles are silent, or, if they complain, it is only among\r\nthemselves. As they know one another, and are doubly brothers, having\r\nthe same fatherland and sharing the same proscription, they tell one\r\nanother their sufferings. He who has money shares it with those who\r\nhave none, he who has firmness imparts it to those who lack it. They\r\nexchange recollections, aspirations, hopes. They turn, their arms\r\nextended in the darkness towards those they have left behind. Oh! how\r\nhappy they who think no more of us! Every man suffers and at times\r\nwaxes wroth. The names of all the executioners are engraven in the\r\nmemory of all. Each has something to curse,--Mazas, the hulk, the\r\ndungeon, the informer who betrayed, the spy who watched, the gendarme\r\nwho arrested him, Lambessa, where one has a friend, Cayenne, where one\r\nhas a brother; but there is one thing that is blessed by all, and that\r\nis thou, France!\r\n\r\nOh! a complaint, a word against thee, France! No! no! one's country is\r\nnever so deeply fixed in the heart as when one is torn from it by\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nThey will do their whole duty, with a tranquil brow and unshaken\r\nperseverance. Never to see thee again is their sorrow, never to forget\r\nthee their joy.\r\n\r\nAh, what grief! And after eight months it is in vain that we say to\r\nourselves that these things are so; it is in vain that we look around\r\nus and see the spire of Saint-Michael's instead of the Pantheon, and\r\nSaint-Gudule instead of Notre-Dame,--we cannot believe it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, true, it cannot be denied, we must admit it, we must\r\nacknowledge it, even though we expire of humiliation and despair,--that\r\nwhich is lying there, on the ground, is the nineteenth century, is\r\nFrance!\r\n\r\nAnd it is this Bonaparte who has caused all this ruin!\r\n\r\nAnd it is in the very centre of the greatest nation upon earth! it is\r\nin the midst of the greatest century of all history, that this man has\r\nsuddenly risen and has triumphed! To seize upon France as his prey,\r\ngreat Heaven! What the lion would not dare to do, the ape has done!\r\nwhat the eagle would have dreaded to seize in his talons, the parrot\r\nhas taken in his claws! What! Louis XI failed! Richelieu destroyed\r\nhimself in the attempt! Even Napoleon was unequal to it! In a single\r\nday, between night and morning, the absurd became the possible! All\r\nthat was axiomatic has become chimerical. All that was false has become\r\nliving fact. What! the most brilliant concourse of men! the most\r\nmagnificent movements of ideas! the most formidable sequence of events!\r\na thing that no Titian could have controlled, that no Hercules could\r\nhave turned aside,--the human flood in full course, the French wave\r\nsweeping onward, civilization, progress, intelligence, revolution,\r\nliberty,--he stopped it all one fine morning, stopped it short, he,\r\nthis mask, this dwarf, this aborted Tiberius, this nothing!\r\n\r\nGod was advancing. Louis Bonaparte, his plume on his head, blocked his\r\npath and said to God: \"Thou shalt go no farther!\"\r\n\r\nGod halted.\r\n\r\nAnd you fancy that this is so! and you imagine that this plebiscite\r\nexists, that this constitution of some day or other in January exists,\r\nthat this Senate exists, that this Council of State and this Corps\r\nLégislatif exist! You fancy that there is a lackey who is called\r\nRouher, a valet who is called Troplong, a eunuch who is called Baroche,\r\nand a sultan, a pacha, a master who is called Louis Bonaparte! You do\r\nnot see, then, that all this is a chimera! you do not see that the\r\n2nd of December is nothing but an immense illusion, a pause, a\r\nbreathing-space, a sort of drop-curtain behind which God, that\r\nmarvellous scene-shifter, is preparing and constructing the last act,\r\nthe supreme, triumphal act of the French Revolution! You gaze stupidly\r\nat the curtain, at the things painted on the coarse canvas, this one's\r\nnose, that one's epaulettes, the great sabre of a third, those belaced\r\nvenders of _eau de Cologne_ whom you call generals, those _poussahs_\r\nwhom you call magistrates, those worthy men whom you call senators,\r\nthis mixture of caricatures and spectres, and you take them all for\r\nrealities! And you do not hear beyond them, in the shadow, that hollow\r\nsound! you do not hear some one going and coming! you do not see that\r\ncurtain quiver in the breath of Him who is behind!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
