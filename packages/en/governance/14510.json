I.\r\n\r\n_SECOND EDITION_.\r\n\r\n1888\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Upon the future of Ireland hangs the future of the British Empire.\"\r\nCARDINAL MANNING TO EARL GREY, 1868\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough barely a month has elapsed since the publication of these\r\nvolumes, events of more or less general notoriety have so far confirmed\r\nthe views taken in them of the actual state and outlook of affairs in\r\nIreland, that I gladly comply with the request of my publisher for a\r\nPreface to this Second Edition.\r\n\r\nUpon one most important point--the progressive demoralisation of the\r\nIrish people by the methods of the so-called political combinations,\r\nwhich are doing the work of the Agrarian and Anti-Social Revolution in\r\nIreland, some passages, from a remarkable sermon delivered in August in\r\nthe Cathedral of Waterford by the Catholic bishop of that diocese, will\r\nbe found to echo almost to the letter the statement given to me in June\r\nby a strong Protestant Home Ruler, that \"the Nationalists are stripping\r\nIrishmen as bare of moral sense as the bushmen of South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of what he had personally witnessed in one of the lanes of\r\nWaterford, the Bishop says, in the report which I have seen of his\r\nsermon, \"the most barbarous tribes of Africa would justly feel ashamed\r\nif they were guilty of what I saw, or approached to the guilt I\r\nwitnessed, on that occasion.\" As a faithful shepherd of his people, he\r\nis not content with general denunciations of their misconduct, but goes\r\non to analyse the influences which are thus reducing a Christian people\r\nto a level below that of the savages whom Cardinal Lavigerie is now\r\norganising a great missionary crusade to rescue from their degradation.\r\n\r\nHe agrees with Archbishop Croke in attributing much of this\r\ndemoralisation to the excessive and increasing use of strong drink,\r\nstriking evidences of which came under my own observation at more than\r\none point of my Irish journeys. But I fear Archbishop Croke would\r\nscarcely agree with the Bishop of Waterford in his diagnosis of the\r\neffects upon the popular character of what has now come to pass current\r\nin many parts of Ireland as \"patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop says, \"The women as well as the men were fighting, and when\r\nwe sought to bring them to order, one man threatened to take up a weapon\r\nand drive bishop, priests, and police from the place! On the Quay, I\r\nunderstand, it was one scene of riot and disorder, and what made matters\r\nworse was that when the police went to discharge their duty for the\r\nprotection of the people, the moment they interfered the people turned\r\non them and maltreated them in a shocking way. I understand that some\r\npolice who were in coloured clothes were picked out for the worst\r\ntreatment--knocked down and kicked brutally. One police officer, I\r\nlearn, had his fingers broken. This is a state of things that nothing at\r\nall would justify. It is not to be justified or excused on any principle\r\nof reason or religion. What is still worse, sympathy was shown for those\r\nwho had obstructed and attacked the police. The only excuse I could find\r\nthat was urged for this shameful misconduct was that it was dignified\r\nwith the name of 'patriotism'! All I can say is, that if rowdyism like\r\nthis be an indication of the patriotism of the people, as far as I am\r\nconcerned, I say, better our poor country were for ever in political\r\nslavery than attain to liberty by such means.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the language of a good Catholic, of a good Irishman, and of a\r\nfaithful Bishop. Were it more often heard from the lips of the Irish\r\nEpiscopate the true friends of Ireland might look forward to her future\r\nwith more hope and confidence than many of the best and ablest of them\r\nare now able to feel. As things actually are, not even the Papal Decree\r\nhas yet sufficed to restrain ecclesiastics, not always of the lowest\r\ndegree, from encouraging by their words and their conduct \"patriotism\"\r\nof the type commemorated by the late Colonel Prentiss of Louisville, in\r\na story which he used to tell of a tipsy giant in butternut garments,\r\narmed with a long rifle, who came upon him in his office on a certain\r\nFourth of July demanding the loan of a dollar on the ground that he felt\r\n\"so confoundedly patriotic!\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel judiciously handed the man a dollar, and then asked, \"Pray,\r\nhow do you feel when you feel confoundedly patriotic?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel,\" responded the man gravely, \"as if I should like to kill\r\nsomebody or steal something.\"\r\n\r\nIt is \"patriotism\" of this sort which the Papal Decree was issued to\r\nexpel from within the pale of the Catholic Church. And it is really, in\r\nthe last analysis of the facts of the case, to the suppression of\r\n\"patriotism\" of this sort that many well-intentioned, but certainly not\r\nwell-informed, \"sympathisers\" with what they suppose to be the cause of\r\nIreland, object, in my own country and in Great Britain, when they\r\ndenounce as \"Coercion\" the imprisonment of members of Parliament and\r\nother rhetorical persons who go about encouraging or compelling ignorant\r\npeople to support \"boycotting\" and the \"Plan of Campaign.\"\r\n\r\nYet it would seem to be sufficiently obvious that \"patriotism\" of this\r\nsort, once full-blown and flourishing on the soil of Ireland, must tend\r\nto propagate itself far beyond the confines of that island, and to\r\ndiversify with its blood-red flowers and its explosive fruits the social\r\norder of countries in which it has not yet been found necessary for the\r\nHead of the Catholic Church to reaffirm the fundamental principles of\r\nLaw and of Liberty.\r\n\r\nSince these volumes were published, too, the Agrarian Revolution in\r\nIreland has been brought into open and defiant collision with the\r\nCatholic Church by its leader, Mr. Davitt, the founder of the Land\r\nLeague. In the face of Mr. Davitt's contemptuous and angry repudiation\r\nof any binding force in the Papal Decree, it will be difficult even for\r\nthe Cardinal-Archbishop of Sydney to devise an understanding between the\r\nChurch and any organisation fashioned or led by him. It may be inferred\r\nfrom Mr. Davitt's contemporaneous and not less angry intimation, that\r\nthe methods of the Parnellite party are inadequate to the liberation of\r\nIreland from the curse of landlordism, that he is prepared to go further\r\nthan Mr. George, who still clings in America to the shadowy countenance\r\ngiven him by the Cardinal-Archbishop of Baltimore, and that the\r\nNationalisation of the Land will ere long be urged both in Ireland and\r\nin Great Britain by organisations frankly Anti-Catholic as well as\r\nAnti-Social.\r\n\r\nThis is to be desired on many accounts. It will bring the clergy in\r\nIreland face to face with the situation, which will be a good thing\r\nboth for them and for the people; and it should result in making an end\r\nof the pernicious influence upon the popular mind of such extraordinary\r\ntheological outgivings; for example, as the circular issued in 1881 to\r\nthe clergy and laity of Meath by the Bishop of that diocese, in which it\r\nwas laid down that \"the land of every country is the common property of\r\nthe people of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made\r\nit, has transferred it as a voluntary gift to them.\"\r\n\r\nLanguage of this sort addressed to ignorant multitudes must do harm of\r\ncourse whenever and by whomsoever used. It must tend to evil if\r\naddressed by demagogues to the Congress of a Trade Union. But it must do\r\nmuch more harm when uttered with the seeming sanction of the Church by a\r\nmitred bishop to congregations already solicited to greed, cunning, and\r\ndishonesty, by an unscrupulous and well-organised \"agitation.\"\r\n\r\nNot less instructive than Mr. Davitt's outburst from the Church is his\r\nalmost furious denunciation of the Irish tenants who obeyed an instinct,\r\nthought honourable to mankind in most ages and countries, by agreeing\r\ntogether to present to their landlord, Earl Fitzwilliam, a token of\r\ntheir respect and regard on the celebration of his golden wedding day.\r\n\r\nThese tenants are denounced, not because they were paying homage to a\r\ntyrannical or an unworthy landlord, though Mr. Davitt was so transported\r\nbeyond his ordinary and cooler self with rage at their action that he\r\nactually stooped to something like an insinuation of disbelief in the\r\nexcellence of Lord Fitzwilliam's character. The true and avowed burden\r\nof his diatribe was that no landlord could possibly deserve well of his\r\ntenants. The better he is as a man, the more they ought to hate him as a\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of land, in other words, is of itself in the eyes of Mr.\r\nDavitt what the ownership of a slave was in the eyes of the earlier\r\nAbolitionists--crime so monstrous as to be beyond pardon or endurance.\r\nIf this be true of Great Britain and Ireland, where no allodial tenure\r\nexists, how much more true must it be of New York? And if true of the\r\nman who owns a thousand acres, it must be equally true of the man who\r\nowns an acre. There could not be a better illustration than Mr. Davitt\r\nhas given in his attack on the Fitzwilliam tenants of the precise\r\naccuracy of what I have had occasion to say in these volumes of the\r\n\"irrepressible conflict\" between his schemes and the establishment of a\r\npeasant proprietorship in Ireland. It is more than this. It is a\r\ndistinct warning served upon the smallest tenants as well as upon the\r\ngreatest landlords in the United Kingdom that fixity of any form of\r\nindividual tenure is irreconcilable with the Agrarian agitations.\r\n\r\nI anticipated this demonstration, but I did not anticipate that it would\r\ncome so fully or so soon.\r\n\r\nI anticipated also abundant proof from my own side of the water of the\r\naccuracy of my impressions as to the drift of the American-Irish towards\r\nProtection and Republicanism in American politics. This, too, has come\r\nearlier and not less fully than I had expected. Mr. Patrick Ford, the\r\nmost influential leader of the American-Irish, issued early in August a\r\nstatement of his views as to the impending Presidential election. \"The\r\nissue to-day,\" he says, \"is the Tariff. It is the American system\r\n_versus_ the British Colonial system. The Irish are instinctively\r\nProtectionists.\" And why? Mr. Ford goes on to explain. \"The fact,\" he\r\nobserves, \"that the Lion and the Unicorn have taken the stump for\r\nCleveland and Thurnan is not calculated to hurt Harrison and Morton in\r\nthe estimation of the Irish, who will, I promise, give a good account of\r\nthemselves in the coming Presidential election.\" Hatred of England, in\r\nother words, is an axiom in their Political Economy!\r\n\r\nMr. Davitt's menacing allusion to Parnell as a landlord, and Mr.\r\nO'Leary's scornful treatment in a letter to me of the small-fry English\r\nRadicals,[1] when taken together, distinctly prefigure an imminent\r\nrupture between the Parnellite party and the two wings--Agrarian and\r\nFenian--of the real revolutionary movement in Ireland. It is clear that\r\nclerical agitators, high and low, must soon elect between following Mr.\r\nGeorge, Dr. M'Glynn, and Mr. Davitt, and obeying fully the Papal Decree.\r\n\r\nIt is a most curious feature of the situation in Ireland that much more\r\ndiscontent with the actual conditions of life in that country seems to\r\nbe felt by people who do not than by people who do live in Ireland. It\r\nis the Irish in America and Australia, who neither sow nor reap in\r\nIreland, pay no taxes there, and bear no burdens, who find the alien\r\noppression most intolerable. This explains the extreme bitterness with\r\nwhich Mr. Davitt in some recent speeches and letters denounces the\r\ntameness of the Irish people, and rather amusingly berates the British\r\nallies of his Parnellite associates for their failure to develop any\r\nstriking and sensational resistance to the administration of law in\r\nIreland. I have printed in this edition[2] an instructive account,\r\nfurnished to me by Mr. Tener, of some recent evictions on the\r\nClanricarde property in Galway, which shows how hard it is for the most\r\ndetermined \"agitators\" to keep the Irish tenants up to that high concert\r\npitch of resistance to the law which alone would meet the wishes of the\r\ntrue agrarian leaders; and how comparatively easy it is for a just and\r\nresolute man, armed with the power of the law resolutely enforced, to\r\nbreak up an illegal combination even in some of the most disturbed\r\nregions of Ireland.[3] While this is encouraging to the friends of law\r\nand order in Ireland, it must not be forgotten that it involves also a\r\ncertain peril for them. The more successfully the law is enforced in\r\nIreland, the greater perhaps is the danger that the British\r\nconstituencies, upon which, of course, the administrators of the law\r\ndepend for their authority, may lose sight and sense of the\r\nRevolutionary forces at work there. History shows that this has more\r\nthan once happened in the past. Englishmen and Scotchmen will be better\r\nable than I am to judge how far it is unlikely that it should happen\r\nagain in the future.\r\n\r\nAs to one matter of great moment--the effect of Lord Ashbourne's Act--a\r\ncorrespondent sends me a statement, which I reproduce here, as it gives\r\na very satisfactory account of the automatic financial machinery upon\r\nwhich that Act must depend for success:--\r\n\r\n     \"Out of £90,630 of instalments due last May, less than £4000 is\r\n    unpaid at the present moment, on transactions extending over three\r\n    years with all classes of tenants. The total amount which accrued,\r\n    due to the Land Commission in respect of instalments since the\r\n    passing of the Act to the 1st November 1887, was £50,910. Of this\r\n    there is only now unpaid £731, 17s. 9d. There accrued a further\r\n    amount to the 1st May 1888 of £39,720, in respect of which only\r\n    £4071, 16s. 11d. is now unpaid, making in all only £4803, 14s. 8d.\r\n    unpaid, out of a total sum of £90,630 due up to last gale day, some\r\n    of which by this time has been paid off.\"\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be worth considering in connection with the objection\r\nmade to any serious extension of Lord Ashbourne's Act by Mr. Chamberlain\r\nin his extremely clear and able preface to a programme of \"Unionist\r\nPolicy for Ireland\" just issued by the \"National Radical Union.\"\r\n\r\nLONDON, _21st Sept_. 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

The measure of that proper\r\ncontrol is now, as it always has been, a question not for Americans, but\r\nfor the people of Great Britain and of Ireland. If Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald and his associates had succeeded in expelling British\r\nauthority from Ireland, and in founding an Irish Republic, we should\r\nprobably have recognised that Republic. Yet an American minister at the\r\nCourt of St. James's saw no impropriety in advising our Government to\r\nrefuse a refuge in the United States to the defeated Irish exiles of\r\n'98.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the opinion of every Irish American who possesses any\r\nreal influence with the people of his own race in my country, that the\r\nrights and liberties of Ireland can only be effectually secured by a\r\ncomplete political separation from Great Britain. Nor can the right of\r\nIrish American citizens, holding this opinion, to express their sympathy\r\nwith Irishmen striving in Ireland to bring about such a result, and with\r\nEnglishmen or Scotchmen contributing to it in Great Britain, be\r\nquestioned, any more than the right of Polish citizens of the French\r\nRepublic to express their sympathy with Poles labouring in Poland for\r\nthe restoration of Polish nationality. It is perhaps even less open to\r\nquestion than the right of Americans not of Irish race, and of Frenchmen\r\nnot of Polish race, to express such sympathies; and certainly less open\r\nto question than the right of Englishmen or Americans to express their\r\nsympathy with Cubans bent on sundering the last link which binds Cuba to\r\nSpain, or with Greeks bent on overthrowing the authority of the Sultan\r\nin Crete.\r\n\r\nBut for all American citizens of whatever race, the expression of such\r\nsympathies ceases to be legitimate when it assumes the shape of action\r\ntranscending the limits set by local or by international law. It is of\r\nthe essence of American constitutionalism that one community shall not\r\nlay hands upon the domestic affairs of another; and it is an undeniable\r\nfact that the sympathy of the great body of the American people with\r\nIrish efforts for self-government has been diminished, not increased,\r\nsince 1848, by the gradual transfer of the head-quarters and machinery\r\nof those efforts from Ireland to the United States. The recent refusal\r\nof the Mayor of New York, Mr. Hewitt, to allow what is called the \"Irish\r\nNational flag\" to be raised over the City Hall of New York is vastly\r\nmore significant of the true drift of American feeling on this subject\r\nthan any number of sympathetic resolutions adopted at party conventions\r\nor in State legislatures by party managers, bent on harpooning Irish\r\nvoters. If Ireland had really made herself a \"nation,\" with or without\r\nthe consent of Great Britain, a refusal to hoist the Irish flag on the\r\noccasion of an Irish holiday would be not only churlish but foolish. But\r\nthousands of Americans, who might view with equanimity the disruption of\r\nthe British Empire and the establishment of an Irish republic, regard,\r\nnot only with disapprobation, but with resentment, the growing\r\ndisposition of Irish agitators in and out of the British Parliament to\r\nthrash out on American soil their schemes for bringing about these\r\nresults with the help of Irishmen who have assumed the duties by\r\nacquiring the rights of American citizenship. It is not in accordance\r\nwith the American doctrine of \"Home Rule\" that \"Home Rule\" of any sort\r\nfor Ireland should be organised in New York or in Chicago by\r\nexpatriated Irishmen.\r\n\r\nNo man had a keener or more accurate sense of this than the most\r\neloquent and illustrious Irishman whose voice was ever heard in America.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1871 Father Burke of Tallaght and San Clemente, with\r\nwhom I had formed at Rome in early manhood a friendship which ended only\r\nwith his life, came to America as the commissioned Visitor of the\r\nDominican Order. His mission there will live for ever in the Catholic\r\nannals of the New World. But of one episode of that mission no man\r\nliving perhaps knows so much as I, and I make no excuse for this\r\nallusion to it here, as it illustrates perfectly the limits between the\r\nlawful and the unlawful in the agitation of Irish questions upon\r\nAmerican soil.\r\n\r\nWhile Father Burke was in New York Mr. Froude came there, having been\r\ninvited to deliver before a Protestant Literary Association a series of\r\nlectures upon the history of Ireland. My personal relations with Mr.\r\nFroude, I should say here, and my esteem for his rare abilities, go back\r\nto the days of the _Nemesis of Faith_, and I did not affect to disguise\r\nfrom him the regret with which I learned his errand to the New World.\r\nThat his lectures would be brilliant, impressive, and interesting, was\r\nquite certain; but it was equally certain, I thought, that they would\r\ndo a world of mischief, by stirring up ancient issues of strife between\r\nthe Protestant and the Catholic populations of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat they would be answered angrily, indiscreetly, and in a fashion to\r\naggravate prejudices which ought to be appeased on both sides of the\r\nquestions involved, was much more than probable. All this accordingly I\r\nurged upon Father Burke, begging him to find or make time in the midst\r\nof his engrossing duties for a systematic course of lectures in reply.\r\nWhat other men would surely say in heat and with virulence would be said\r\nby him, I knew, temperately, loftily, and wisely. Three strenuous\r\nobjections he made. One was that his work as a Catholic missionary\r\ndemanded all his thought and all his time; another that he was not\r\nhistorically equipped to deal with so formidable an antagonist; and a\r\nthird that America ought not to be a battle-ground of Irish contentions.\r\nIt was upon the last that he dwelt most tenaciously; nor did he give way\r\nuntil he had satisfied himself, after consulting with the highest\r\nauthorities of his Church, and with two or three of the coolest and most\r\njudicious Irish citizens of New York, that I was right in believing that\r\nhis appearance in the arena as the champion of Ireland, would lift an\r\ninevitable controversy high above the atmosphere of unworthy passion,\r\nand put it beyond the reach of political mischief-makers.\r\n\r\nHow nobly he did his work when he had become convinced that he ought to\r\ndo it, is now matter of history. But it is a hundredfold more needful\r\nnow than it was in 1871 and 1872, that the spirit in which he did it\r\nshould be known and published abroad. In the interval between the\r\ndelivery of two of his replies to Mr. Froude, Mr. Froude went to Boston.\r\nA letter from Boston informed me that upon Mr. Froude's arrival there,\r\nall the Irish servants of the friend with whom he was to stay had\r\nsuddenly left the house, refusing to their employer the right to invite\r\nunder his roof a guest not agreeable to them. I handed this letter,\r\nwithout a word, to Father Burke a few hours before he was to speak in\r\nthe Academy of Music. He read it with a kind of humorous wrath; and when\r\nthe evening came, he prefaced his lecture with a few strong and stirring\r\nwords, in which he castigated with equal sense and severity the\r\nmisconduct of his country-people, anticipating thus by many a year the\r\nspirit in which the supreme authority of his Church has just now dealt\r\nwith the social plague of \"boycotting,\" whereof the strike of the\r\nservant girls at Boston sixteen years ago was a precursory symptom.\r\n\r\nFather Burke understood that American citizenship imposes duties where\r\nit confers rights. Nobody expects the European emigrant who abjures his\r\nforeign allegiance to divest himself of his native sympathies or\r\nantipathies. But American law, and the conditions of American liberty,\r\nrequire him to divest himself of the notion that he retains any right\r\nactively to interfere in the domestic affairs of the country of his\r\nbirth. For public and political purposes, the Irishman who becomes an\r\nAmerican ceases to be an Irishman. When Mr. Gladstone's Government in\r\n1881 seized and locked up indefinitely, on \"suspicion\" of what they\r\nmight be about to do, American citizens of Irish birth, these \"suspects\"\r\nclamoured, and had a right to clamour, for the intervention of the\r\nAmerican Government to protect them against being dealt with as if they\r\nwere Irishmen and British subjects. But by the abjuration of British\r\nallegiance which gave them this right to clamour for American\r\nprotection, they had voluntarily made themselves absolute foreigners to\r\nIreland, with no more legal or moral right to interfere in the affairs\r\nof that country than so many Chinamen or Peruvians.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I ought, in justice to my fellow-citizens of Irish\r\nbirth, to say that these elementary truths have too often been obscured\r\nfor them by the conduct of public bodies in America, and of American\r\npublic men.\r\n\r\nNo American public man of reputation, holding an executive office in the\r\nFederal Government, has ever thrust himself, it is true, so inexcusably\r\ninto the domestic affairs of Great Britain and Ireland as did Mr.\r\nGladstone into the domestic affairs of the United States when, speaking\r\nat Newcastle in the very crisis of our great civil war, he gave all the\r\nweight of his position as a Cabinet Minister to the assertion that Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis had created not only an army and a navy, but a nation,\r\nand thereby compelled the Prime Minister of Great Britain to break the\r\neffect of this declaration by insisting that another Cabinet Minister,\r\nSir George Cornewall Lewis, should instantly make a speech countering\r\nit, and covering the neutrality of the British Government.[4]\r\n\r\nNor has either House of the Congress of the United States ever been\r\nguilty of the impertinence of adopting resolutions of sympathy with the\r\nHome Rule, or any other movement affecting directly the domestic affairs\r\nof the British Empire, though, within my own knowledge, very strong\r\npressure has been more than once put upon the Foreign Affairs Committees\r\nof both Houses to bring this about.\r\n\r\nBut such resolutions have been repeatedly adopted by State Legislatures,\r\nand individual members, both of the Federal Senate and of the Federal\r\nLower House, have discredited themselves, and brought such discredit as\r\nthey could upon the Congress, by effusions of the same sort. The bad\r\ncitizenship of Irish-American citizens, however, is not the less bad\r\ncitizenship because they may have been led into it by the recklessness\r\nof State Legislatures--which have no responsibility for our foreign\r\nrelations--or the sycophancy of public men. If it were proved to\r\ndemonstration that Home Rule would be the salvation of Ireland, no\r\nAmerican citizen would have any more right to take an active part in\r\nfurthering it than to take an active part in dethroning the Czar of all\r\nthe Russias. The lesson which Washington administered to Citizen Genet,\r\nwhen that meddlesome minister of the French Republic undertook to \"boom\"\r\nthe rights of men by issuing letters of marque at Charleston, has\r\ngoverned the foreign relations of the United States ever since, and it\r\nis as binding upon every private citizen as upon every public servant of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nI must ask my readers, therefore, to bear it constantly in mind that all\r\nmy observations and comments have been made from an American, not from a\r\nBritish or an Irish point of view. How or by whom Ireland shall be\r\ngoverned concerns me only in so far as the government of Ireland may\r\naffect the character and the tendencies of the Irish people, and\r\nthereby, through the close, intimate, and increasing connection between\r\nthe Irish people and the people of the United States, may tend to affect\r\nthe future of my country. This being my point of view, it will be\r\napparent, I think, that I have at least laboured under no temptation to\r\nsee things otherwise than as they were, or to state things otherwise\r\nthan as I saw them.\r\n\r\nWith Arthur Young, who more clearly than any other man of his time saw\r\nthe end from the beginning of the fatuous and featherheaded French\r\nRevolution of 1789, I have always been inclined to think \"the\r\napplication of theory to methods of government a surprising imbecility\r\nin the human mind:\" and it will be found that in this book I have done\r\nlittle more than set down, as fully and clearly as I could, what I\r\nactually saw and heard in Ireland. My method has been as simple as my\r\nobject. During each day as occasion served, and always at night, I made\r\nstenographic notes of whatever had attracted my attention or engaged my\r\ninterest. As I had no case to make for or against any political party or\r\nany theory of government in Ireland, I took things great and small, and\r\npeople high and low, as they came, putting myself in contact by\r\npreference, wherever I could, with those classes of the Irish people of\r\nwhom we see least in America, and concerning myself, as to my notes,\r\nonly that they should be made under the vivid immediate impress of\r\nwhatever they were to record. These notes I have subsequently written\r\nout in the spirit in which I made them, in all cases taking what pains\r\nI could to verify statements of facts, and in many cases, where it\r\nseemed desirable or necessary, submitting the proofs of the pages as\r\nfinally printed to the persons whom, after myself, they most concerned.\r\n\r\nI have been more annoyed by the delay than by the trouble thus entailed\r\nupon me; but I shall be satisfied if those who may take the pains to\r\nread the book shall as nearly as possible see what I saw, and hear what\r\nI heard.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to impress my own conclusions upon others who may be\r\nbetter able than I am accurately to interpret the facts from which these\r\nconclusions have been drawn. Such as they are, I have put them into a\r\nfew pages at the end of the book.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that I have touched only incidentally upon the subject\r\nof Home Rule for Ireland. Until it shall be ascertained what \"Home Rule\r\nfor Ireland\" means, that subject seems to me to lie quite outside the\r\ndomain of my inquiries. \"Home Rule for Ireland\" is not now a plan--nor\r\nso much as a proposition. It is merely a polemical phrase, of little\r\nimportance to persons really interested in the condition of Ireland,\r\nhowever invaluable it may be to the makers of party platforms in my own\r\ncountry, or to Parliamentary candidates on this side of the Atlantic. It\r\nmay mean anything or nothing, from Mr. Chamberlain's imperialist scheme\r\nof four Provincial Councils--which recalls the outlines of a system\r\nonce established with success in New Zealand--to that absolute and\r\ncomplete separation in all particulars of the government of Ireland from\r\nthe government of Great Britain, which has unquestionably been the aim\r\nof every active Irish organisation in the United States for the last\r\ntwenty years, and which the accredited leader of the \"Home Rule\" party\r\nin the British Parliament, Mr. Parnell, is understood in America to have\r\npledged himself that he will do anything to further and nothing to\r\nimpede. On this point, what I took to be conclusive documentary evidence\r\nwas submitted to me in New York several years ago by Mr. Sheridan, at a\r\ntime when the fever-heat of British indignation excited by those murders\r\nin the Phoenix Park, for which I believe it is now admitted by the best\r\ninformed authorities that Mr. Sheridan had no responsibility, was\r\ndriving Mr. Parnell and his Parliamentary associates into disavowals of\r\nthe extreme men of their connection, which, but for Mr. Sheridan's\r\ncoolness and consciousness of his well-assured domination over them,\r\nmight have led to extremely inconvenient consequences to all\r\nconcerned.[5] But whatever \"Home Rule\" may or may not mean, I went to\r\nIreland, not to find some achromatic meaning for a prismatic phrase,\r\nwhich is flashed at you fifty times in England or America where you\r\nencounter it once in Ireland, but to learn what I could of the social\r\nand economical condition of the Irish people as affected by the\r\nrevolutionary forces which are now at work in that country.\r\n\r\nI have watched the development of these forces too long and too closely\r\nto be under any illusion as to the real importance relatively with them\r\nof the so-called \"Parliamentary\" action of the Irish Nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe visits to Ireland, of which this book is a record, were made on my\r\nreturn from a sojourn in Rome during the celebration of the Jubilee of\r\nHis Holiness Leo XIII. What I then and there learned convinced me that\r\nthe Vatican was on the eve of grappling in Ireland with issues\r\nsubstantially identical with those which were forced, in my own country,\r\ntwo years ago, upon a most courageous and gifted member of the American\r\nCatholic hierarchy, the Archbishop of New York, by the open adhesion of\r\nan eminent Irish American ecclesiastic, the Rev. Dr. M'Glynn, to the\r\nsocial revolution of which Mr. Henry George is the best-equipped and\r\nmost indefatigable apostle. Entertaining this conviction (which events\r\nhave since shown to have been well-founded), I was anxious to survey on\r\nthe spot the conditions under which the conflict so vigorously\r\nencountered by the Archbishop in New York must be waged by the Vatican\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that the Vatican, in dealing with this conflict, either in\r\nIreland or in America, is troubling itself about the balancing of\r\npolitical acrobats, British or American, upon the tight-rope of \"Home\r\nRule,\" is as absurd as it would have been to suppose that in 1885 the\r\nVatican concerned itself with the subterranean intrigues which there is\r\nreason to believe the Irish Nationalists then sought to carry on with\r\nthe wire-pullers of the two great British political parties. To get a\r\ncorrect perspective of the observations which I came from Rome this year\r\nto make in Ireland, my readers, as I have already said, must allow me to\r\ntake them across the Atlantic, and must put aside as accessory and\r\nincidental the forensic and polemic phenomena of Irish politics, with\r\nwhich they are perhaps only too familiar.\r\n\r\nIt is as easy to go too far back as it is not to go back far enough in\r\nthe study of such a revolutionary movement as that of which Ireland is\r\njust now the arena.\r\n\r\nMany and sore are the historical grievances of the Irish people. That\r\nthey are historical and not actual grievances would seem to be admitted\r\nby so sympathetic and minutely well-informed a writer as Dr. Sigerson,\r\nwhen he gives it as his opinion, that after the passage of the Land Act\r\nof 1870, \"the concession in principle of the demands of the cultivators\r\nas tenants\" had \"abolished the class war waged between landlords and\r\ntheir tenantry.\"\r\n\r\nThe class war between the tenantry and their landlords, therefore, which\r\nis now undoubtedly waging in Ireland cannot be attributed to the\r\nhistorical grievances of the Irish people. The tradition and the memory\r\nof these historical grievances may indeed be used by designing or\r\nhysterical traders in agitation to inflame the present war. But the war\r\nitself is not the old war, nor can it be explained by recurring to the\r\ncauses of the old war. It has the characteristics no longer of a\r\ndefensive war, nor yet of a war of revenge absolutely, but of an\r\naggressive war, and of a war of conquest. In his able work on \"The Land\r\nTenure and the Land Classes of Ireland,\" Dr. Sigerson, writing in 1871,\r\nlooked forward to the peaceful co-existence in Ireland of two systems of\r\nland-holding, \"whereby the country might enjoy the advantage of what is\r\ngood in the 'landlord,' or single middleman system, and in the peasant\r\nproprietary or direct system.\"\r\n\r\nWhat we now see in Ireland, after nearly twenty years of legislation,\r\nsteadily tending to the triumph of equal rights, is an agitation\r\nthreatening not only the \"co-existence\" of these two systems, but the\r\nvery existence of each of these systems.\r\n\r\nTo get at the origin and the meaning of this agitation we must be\r\ncontent, I believe, to go no further back than ten years, and to look\r\nfor them, not in Ireland, but in America, not to Mr. Parnell and Mr.\r\nGladstone primarily, but to Mr. Davitt and Mr. Henry George.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn a very remarkable letter written to Earl Grey in 1868, after the\r\nClerkenwell explosions had brought the disestablishment of the Irish\r\nProtestant Church into Mr. Gladstone's scheme of \"practical politics,\"\r\nthe Archbishop of Westminster, not then a Cardinal, called the attention\r\nof Englishmen to the fact, not yet I fear adequately apprehended by\r\nthem, that \"the assimilating power of America upon the Irish people, if\r\nseven days slower than that of England in reaching Ireland, is sevenfold\r\nmore penetrating and powerful upon the whole population.\" By this the\r\nArchbishop meant, what was unquestionably true, that even in 1868, only\r\ntwenty years after the great Irish exodus to America began, the social\r\nand political ideas of America were exerting a seven-fold stronger\r\ninfluence upon the character and the tendencies of the Irish people than\r\nthe social and political ideas of England. Thanks to the development of\r\nthe cables and the telegraph since 1868, and to the enormous progress\r\nof America since that time in wealth and population, this \"assimilating\r\npower\" reaches Ireland much more rapidly, and exerts upon the Irish\r\npeople a very much more drastic influence than in 1868. This\r\nestablishes, of course, a return current westward, which is as necessary\r\nto he watched, and is as much neglected by American as the original\r\neastward current is by British public men.\r\n\r\nIn this letter of 1868 to Earl Grey, the Archbishop of Westminster\r\ndesiring, as an Englishman, to counteract, if possible, this influence\r\nwhich was drawing Ireland away from the British monarchy, and towards\r\nthe American Republic, maintained that by two things the \"heart of\r\nIreland\" might be won, and her affections enlisted with her interests in\r\nthe support of the unity, solidity, and prosperity of the British\r\nEmpire. One of these two things was \"perfect religious equality between\r\nthe Catholics and the Protestants of Ireland.\" The other was that the\r\nImperial Legislature should by statute make it impossible for any\r\nlandlord in Ireland to commit three wrongs,--\"first, the wrong of\r\nabusing his rights by arbitrary eviction; secondly, by exacting an\r\nexorbitant rent; thirdly, by appropriating to his own use the\r\nimprovements effected by the industry of his tenants.\"\r\n\r\nPerfect religious equality has since been established between the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants of Ireland. The three wrongs which the\r\nArchbishop called upon the Imperial Legislature to make impossible to\r\nIrish landlords have since been made impossible by Statute.\r\n\r\nYet it is on all hands admitted that the \"unity, solidity, and\r\nprosperity\" of the British Empire have never been so seriously\r\nthreatened in Ireland as during the last ten years. Was the Archbishop\r\nwrong, therefore, in his estimate of the situation in 1868? Or has the\r\ncentripetal influence of remedial British legislation since 1868 failed\r\nto check a centrifugal advance \"by leaps and bounds,\" in the\r\n\"assimilating power\" of America upon Ireland?\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nJust ten years ago, in 1878, Mr. Michael Davitt and Mr. John Devoy (the\r\nlatter of whom had been commissioned in 1865 by the Fenian leader\r\nStephens, as \"chief organiser of the Irish Republican Brotherhood in the\r\nBritish army\"), being then together in America, promulgated, Mr. Davitt\r\nin a speech at Boston, and Mr. Devoy in a letter sent to the _Freeman's\r\nJournal_ in Dublin, the outlines of a scheme for overthrowing British\r\nrule in Ireland by revolutionising the ownership of land in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe basis of this scheme had been laid thirty years before, in 1848, by\r\nFinton Lalor, John Mitchel, and the present Archbishop of Cashel, then a\r\nsimple curate.\r\n\r\nIt was thus stated by Lalor in his paper, the _Irish Felon_:--\r\n\r\n\"The entire ownership of Ireland, moral and material, up to the sun and\r\ndown to the centre of the earth, is vested, as of right, in the people\r\nof Ireland. The soil of the country belongs as of right to the entire\r\npeople of the country, not to any one class, but to the nation.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a distinct denial of the right of private property in land. If\r\ntrue of Ireland and the Irish people this proposition was true of all\r\nlands and of all peoples. Lalor, though more of a patriot than of a\r\nphilosopher, saw this plainly; and in one of the three numbers of his\r\npaper which appeared before it was suppressed by the British Government,\r\nhe said \"the principle I propose goes to the foundations of Europe, and\r\nsooner or later will cause Europe to uprise.\" Michael Davitt saw this as\r\nclearly in 1878 as Finton Lalor thirty years before. He had matured his\r\nplans in connection with this principle during the weary but not wasted\r\nyears of his imprisonment as a Fenian at Dartmoor, a place, the name of\r\nwhich is connected in America with many odious memories of the second\r\nwar between England and the United States; and going out to America\r\nalmost immediately after his release on a ticket of leave, he there\r\nfound the ideas of Finton Lalor and his associates of 1848, ripened and\r\nharvested in the mind of an American student of sociology, Henry George.\r\nNowhere in the world has what a shrewd English traveller calls \"the\r\nillegitimate development of private wealth\" attained such proportions in\r\nmodern times as in America, and especially in California. Nowhere, too,\r\nin the world is the ostentatious waste of the results of labour upon the\r\nantics of a frivolous plutocracy a more crying peril of our times than\r\nin America. Henry George, an American of the Eastern States, who went to\r\nthe Pacific coast as a lad, had grown up with and watched the progress\r\nof this social disease in California; and when Davitt reached America in\r\n1878, Henry George was preparing to publish his revolutionary book on\r\n_Progress and Poverty_, which appeared in 1879. Dates are important from\r\nthis point, as they will trace for the reader the formation of the\r\nstrongest forces which, as I believe, are to-day at work to shape the\r\nfuture of Ireland, and, if Cardinal Manning is right, with the future of\r\nIreland, the future of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe year 1878 saw the \"Home Rule\" movement in Irish politics brought to\r\nan almost ludicrous halt by the success of Mr. Parnell, then a young\r\nmember of Parliament for Meath, in unhorsing the leader of that\r\nmovement, Mr. Butt. As the Irish members then had no coherent purpose or\r\npolicy, Mr. Parnell had, without much trouble, dominated and brigaded\r\nthem to follow him blindly into a system of parliamentary obstruction,\r\nwhich there is reason to suppose was suggested to him by a friend who\r\nhad studied the Congressional proceedings of the United States, the\r\nnative country of his mother, and especially the tactics which had\r\nenabled Mr. Randall of Pennsylvania, the leader of the Democratic\r\nminority in the House of Representatives, to check the so-called \"Civil\r\nRights Bill,\" sent down by the Senate to that House, during a continuous\r\nsession of forty-six hours and a half, with no fewer than seventy-seven\r\ncalls of the house, in the month of January 1875, some time before Mr.\r\nParnell first took his seat in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Parnell, early in 1878, thanks to this system, had ousted Mr.\r\nButt, and got himself elected as President of the Irish \"Home Rule\r\nConfederation,\" he found himself, as an Irish friend of mine wrote to me\r\nat the time, in an awkward position. He had command of the \"Home Rule\"\r\nmembers at Westminster, but he had no notion what to do with them, and\r\nneither they nor he could see anyway open to securing a permanent hold\r\nupon the Irish voters. Three bad harvests in succession had thrown the\r\nIrish tenants into a state which disinclined them to make sacrifices\r\nfor any sentimental policy, but prepared them to lend their ears eagerly\r\nto Michael Davitt, when, on his return from the United States in the\r\nearly spring of 1879, he proclaimed anew, at Irishtown in his native\r\ncounty of Mayo, the gospel of 1848 giving the land of Ireland to the\r\npeople of Ireland. Clearly Mr. Davitt held the winning card. As he\r\nfrankly put the case to a special correspondent, whom I sent to see him,\r\nand whose report I published in New York, he saw that \"the only issue\r\nupon which Home Rulers, Nationalists, Obstructionists, and each and\r\nevery shade of opinion existing in Ireland could be united was the Land\r\nQuestion,\" and of that question he took control. Naturally enough, Mr.\r\nParnell, himself a landowner under the English settlement, shrank at\r\nfirst from committing himself and his fortunes to the leadership of Mr.\r\nDavitt. But no choice was really left him, and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that a decision was made easier to him by a then inchoate\r\nundertaking that he should be personally protected against the financial\r\nconsequences to himself of the new departure, by a testimonial fund,\r\nsuch as was in fact raised and presented to him in 1883. In June 1879 he\r\naccepted the inevitable, and in a speech at Westport put himself with\r\nhis parliamentary following and machinery at the service of the founder\r\nof the Irish Land League, uttering the keynote of Mr. Davitt's \"new\r\ndeparture\" in his celebrated appeal to the Irish tenants to \"keep a firm\r\ngrip of their homesteads.\" In the middle of October 1879, Mr. Davitt\r\nformally organised the Irish National Land League, \"to reduce rack-rents\r\nand facilitate the obtaining of the ownership of the land of Ireland by\r\nthe occupiers,\" and Mr. Parnell was made its first President. He was\r\nsent out to America in that capacity, at the end of the year to explain\r\nto the Irish-American leaders the importance of supplying the new\r\norganisation with funds sufficient to enable it to take and keep the\r\nfield at Westminster with a force of paid members not dependent for\r\ntheir support upon the Irish constituencies. It was obviously impossible\r\neither to guarantee any considerable number of Irishmen holding property\r\nagainst loss by a policy aimed at the foundations of property, or to\r\ncount upon finding for every Irish seat a member of local weight and\r\nstake, imbued with the spirit of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell landed at New York on the 1st of January 1880. An interview\r\nwith him, written out on board of the steamer which took him to America\r\nby a correspondent detailed for that purpose, was published on the\r\nmorning after his arrival. It made on the whole an unfavourable\r\nimpression in America, which was not improved by an injudicious quarrel\r\ninto which he drifted with a portion of the American press, and which\r\nwas distinctly deepened by his inexcusable misrepresentations of the\r\nconduct of Queen Victoria during the famine of 1847, and by his foolish\r\nattacks upon the management and objects of the Duchess of Marlborough's\r\nfund for the relief of Irish distress. The friends of Mr. Davitt in\r\nAmerica, however, and the leaders of the most active Irish organisations\r\nthere, came to the rescue, and as the two American parties were\r\npreparing their lines of battle for the Presidential conflict of 1880,\r\nMr. Parnell was not only \"put through\" the usual course of \"receptions\"\r\nby Mayors and State legislatures, but invited on an \"off-day\" to address\r\nthe House of Representatives at Washington. His tour, however, on the\r\nwhole, harmed more than it helped the new Irish movement on my side of\r\nthe Atlantic, and when he was called back to take his part in the\r\nelectoral contest precipitated by Lord Beaconsfield's dissolution of\r\nParliament at Easter 1880, Mr. Davitt went out to America himself to do\r\nwhat his Parliamentary associate had not succeeded in doing. During this\r\nvisit of Mr. Davitt to the United States, Mr. Henry George finally\r\ntransferred his residence from San Francisco to New York, and made his\r\narrangements to visit England and Ireland, and bring about a practical\r\ncombination between the advocates of \"the land for the people\" on both\r\nsides of the ocean. These arrangements he carried out in 1881-82,\r\npublishing in 1881, in America, his treatise on the Irish Land question,\r\nwhile Mr. Davitt, who had been arrested after his return to Europe by\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government in February 1881, on a revocation of his\r\nticket-of-leave, lay a prisoner at Portland. Mr. George himself, while\r\ntravelling in Ireland with an academical English friend, came under\r\n\"suspicion\" in the eyes of one of Mr. Forster's officers, and was\r\narrested, but at once released. During the protracted confinement of Mr.\r\nDavitt at Portland, the utter incapacity of Mr. Parnell and his\r\nParliamentary associates to manage the social revolution initiated by\r\nthe founder of the Land League became fully apparent, not only to\r\nimpartial, but even to sympathetic observers in America, long before it\r\nwas demonstrated by the incarceration of Mr. Parnell in Kilmainham, the\r\ndisavowal, under pressure, of the no-rent manifesto by Archbishop Croke,\r\nand the suppression of the Land League. In sequestrating Mr. Davitt, Mr.\r\nForster, as was shown by the extraordinary scenes which in the House of\r\nCommons followed his arrest, had struck at the core of the revolution,\r\nand had the Irish Secretary not been deserted by Mr. Gladstone, under\r\ninfluences which originated at Kilmainham, and were reinforced by the\r\npressure of the United States Government in the spring of 1882, history\r\nmight have had a very different tale to tell of the last six years in\r\nIreland and in Great Britain.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIt was after the return of Mr. George from Ireland to New York in 1882\r\nthat the first black point appeared on the horizon, of the conflict,\r\ninevitable in the nature of things, between the social revolution and\r\nthe Catholic Church, which assumed such serious proportions two years\r\nago in America, and which is now developing itself in Ireland. Among the\r\nablest and the most earnest converts in America to the doctrine of the\r\nnew social revolution was the Rev. Dr. M'Glynn, a Catholic priest,\r\nstanding in the front rank of his order in New York, in point alike of\r\neloquence in the pulpit, and of influence in private life. Finding, like\r\nMichael Davitt, in the doctrine of Henry George an outcome and a\r\nconfirmation of the principle laid down in 1848 for the liberation of\r\nIreland by Finton Lalor, Dr. M'Glynn threw himself ardently into the\r\nadvocacy of that doctrine,--so ardently that in August 1882 the Prefect\r\nof the Propaganda, Cardinal Simeoni, found it necessary to invite the\r\nattention of Cardinal M'Closkey, then Archbishop of New York, to\r\nspeeches of Dr. M'Glynn, reported in the _Irish World_ of New York, as\r\n\"containing propositions openly opposed to the teachings of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not concern the Propaganda that these propositions ran on\r\nall-fours with the policy of the Irish Land League established by Mr.\r\nDavitt, and accepted by Mr. Parnell. What concerned the Propaganda in\r\nthe propositions of Dr. M'Glynn at New York in 1882 was precisely what\r\nconcerns the Propaganda in the programme of Mr. Davitt as mismanaged by\r\nMr. Dillon in Ireland in 1888--the incompatibility of these\r\npropositions, and of that programme, with the teachings of the Church.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the instructions of the Propaganda in August 1882,\r\nCardinal M'Closkey sent for Dr. M'Glynn, and set the matter plainly\r\nbefore him. Dr. M'Glynn professed regret for his errors, promised to\r\nabstain in future from political meetings, and begged the Cardinal to\r\ninform the authorities at Home of his intention to walk more\r\ncircumspectly. The submission of Dr. M'Glynn was approved at Rome, but\r\nit was gently intimated to him that it needed to be crowned by public\r\nreparation for the scandal he had caused. He disregarded this pastoral\r\nhint, and when the Archbishop Coadjutor of New York, Dr. Corrigan, went\r\nto Rome in 1883 to represent the Cardinal, who was unequal to the\r\njourney, he found the Propaganda by no means satisfied with the attitude\r\nof Dr. M'Glynn. Two years after this, in October 1885, Cardinal\r\nM'Closkey died, and Dr. Corrigan succeeded him as Archbishop of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nBetween the first admonition given to the sacerdotal ally of Mr. George\r\nin 1882 and this event much had come to pass in Ireland. The Land League\r\nsuppressed by Mr. Forster had been suffered to reappear as the National\r\nLeague by Earl Spencer and Mr. Trevelyan. Sir William Harcourt's\r\nstringent and sweeping \"Coercion Act\" of July 11th, 1882, passed under\r\nthe stress of the murders in the Phoenix Park, expiring by its own terms\r\nin July 1885, Mr. Gladstone found himself forced either to alienate a\r\nnumber of his Radical supporters by proposing a renewal of that Act, or\r\nto invite a catastrophe in Ireland by attempting to rule that country\r\nunder \"the ordinary law.\"\r\n\r\nHe elected to escape from the dilemma by inviting a defeat in Parliament\r\non a secondary question of the Budget. He went out of power on the 9th\r\nof June 1885, leaving Lord Salisbury to send the Earl of Carnarvon as\r\nViceroy to Ireland, and the Irish party in Parliament to darken the air\r\non both sides of the Atlantic with portentous intimations of a\r\nmysterious compact, under which they were to secure Home Rule for\r\nIreland by establishing the Conservatives in their places at the general\r\nelection in November.[7]\r\n\r\nWhat came of all this I may briefly rehearse. Going out to America in\r\nNovember 1885, and returning to England in January 1886, I remained in\r\nLondon long enough to assure myself, and to publish in America my\r\nconviction of the utter hopelessness of Mr. Gladstone's \"Home Rule\"\r\nmeasure, the success of which would have made his government the ally\r\nand the instrument of Mr. Parnell in carrying out the plans of Mr.\r\nDavitt, Mr. Henry George, and the active Irish organisations of the\r\nUnited States. All this is matter of history.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Mr. Gladstone's speech of April 8, 1886, introducing his\r\nHome Rule Bill, upon the Irish in America was simply intoxicating. They\r\nsaw him, as in a vision, repeating for the benefit of Ireland at Dublin,\r\non a grander scale, the impressive scene of his surrender in 1858 at\r\nCorfu of the Protectorate of the Ionian Islands to Greece.\r\n\r\nUpon thousands also of Americans, interested more or less intelligently\r\nin British affairs, but neither familiar, nor caring to be, with the\r\ndetails of the political situation in Great Britain, this appearance of\r\nthe British Premier, as the champion of Home Rule for Ireland,\r\ndenouncing the \"baseness and blackguardism\" of Pitt and his\r\naccomplices, the framers of the Union of 1800, naturally produced a very\r\nprofound impression. What might be almost called a \"tidal wave\" of\r\nsympathy with the Irish National League, and with him as its ally, made\r\nitself felt throughout the United States. Had I witnessed the drama from\r\nthe far-off auditorium in New York, I might doubtless have shared the\r\nconviction of so many of my countrymen that we were about to behold the\r\nconsummation tunefully anticipated so many years ago by John Quincy\r\nAdams, and--\r\n\r\n    \"Proud of herself, victorious over fate,\r\n     See Erin rise, an independent state.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment seemed propitious for a resolute forward move in America of\r\nMr. Henry George, and the other American believers in the doctrine of\r\n\"the land for the people.\" It would have been more propitious had not\r\nthe political managers of the Irish party, misapprehending to the last\r\nmoment the drift of things in the British Parliament, and counting\r\nfirmly upon a victory for Mr. Gladstone, either at Westminster or at the\r\npolls, insisted upon holding a great convention of the Irish in America\r\nat Chicago in August 1886. A proposition to do this had been made in the\r\nspring of 1885, and put off, in judicious deference to the disgust which\r\nmany independent Americans of both parties then felt at the course\r\npursued by Mr. Parnell's friends, Mr. Egan and Mr. Sullivan in 1884,\r\nwhen these leaders openly led the Irish with drums beating and green\r\nflags flying out of the Democratic into the Republican camp.\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, Mr. Gladstone having gone out of power a second\r\ntime, on the second day of June in 1886, the non-parliamentary and real\r\nleader in Ireland of the Irish revolutionary movement, Mr. Davitt, came\r\novertly to the front, and crossed the Atlantic to ride the whirlwind and\r\ndirect the storm at the Convention appointed to be held in Chicago on\r\nthe 18th of August.\r\n\r\nIn New York he found Mr. Henry George quietly preparing to put the\r\nemotions of the moment to profit at the municipal election which was to\r\noccur in that city in November, and Dr. M'Glynn more enamoured than ever\r\nof the doctrine of \"the land for the people,\" and more defiant than ever\r\nof the Propaganda and of his ecclesiastical superiors. It was resolved\r\nthat Mr. George should come forward as a candidate for the mayoralty in\r\nNovember, and Dr. M'Glynn determined to take the field in support of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nWe now come to close quarters.\r\n\r\nDr. Corrigan, as I have said, had become the Archbishop of New York in\r\nOctober 1885. The Irish-American Convention met at Chicago, Mr. Davitt\r\ndominating its proceedings by his courageous and outspoken support of\r\nhis defeated Parliamentary allies in England. The candidacy of Mr. Henry\r\nGeorge had not yet been announced in New York. But Dr. M'Glynn resumed\r\nhis practice of addressing public meetings in support of the doctrines\r\nof Mr. Davitt and of Henry George. The Archbishop's duty was plain. It\r\nwas not pleasant. A Catholic prelate of Irish blood living in New York\r\nmight have been pardoned for avoiding, if he could, an open intervention\r\nat such a moment, to prevent an able and popular priest from disobeying\r\nhis ecclesiastical superiors in his zeal for a doctrine hostile to\r\n\"landlordism,\" and cordially approved by the most influential of the\r\nIrish leaders.\r\n\r\nBut on the 21st August 1886, while all the Irishmen in New York were\r\nwild with excitement over the proceedings at Chicago, Archbishop\r\nCorrigan did his duty, and admonished Dr. M'Glynn to restrain his\r\npolitical ardour. The admonition was thrown away. A month later, the\r\ncanvass of Mr. Henry George being then fully opened, Dr. M'Glynn sent\r\nMr. George himself to wait upon the Archbishop with a note of\r\nintroduction as his \"very dear and valued friend,\" in the hope of\r\ninducing the Archbishop to withdraw his inhibition and allow him to\r\nspeak at a great meeting, then about to be held, of the supporters of\r\nMr. George.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop replied in a firm but friendly note, forbidding Dr.\r\nM'Glynn \"in the most positive manner\" to attend the meeting referred to,\r\nor \"any other political meeting whatever.\"\r\n\r\nDr. M'Glynn deliberately disobeyed this order, attended the meeting, and\r\nthrew himself with ever increasing heat into the war against\r\nlandlordism. On the 2d of October 1886, therefore, he was formally\r\n\"suspended\" from his priestly functions--nor has he ever since been\r\npermitted to resume them. Another priest presides over the great church\r\nof St. Stephen, of which he was the rector. More than once the door of\r\nrepentance and return has been opened to him; but, I believe, he is\r\nstill waging war in his own way, and beyond the precincts of the\r\npriesthood, both upon the right of private property in land and upon the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nHe is a man of vigorous intellect; and he has defined the issue between\r\nhimself and the Church in language so terse and clear that I reproduce\r\nit here. It defines also the real issue of to-day between the Church\r\nspeaking through the Papal Decree of April 20, 1888, and the National\r\nLeague of Ireland acting through the \"Plan of Campaign.\"\r\n\r\nNo heed having been paid by Dr. M'Glynn to several successive\r\nintimations summoning him to go to Rome and explain his attitude, he\r\nfinally, on the 20th of December 1886, wrote a letter in which, with a\r\nsingle skilful turn of his wrist, he took out the core of Henry George's\r\ndoctrine as to land, which really is the core also of the Irish Plan of\r\nCampaign, and thus laid it before the Archbishop of New York:--\r\n\r\n\"My doctrine about land has been made clear in speeches, in reports of\r\ninterviews, and in published articles, and I repeat it here. I have\r\ntaught, and I shall continue to teach in speeches and writings, as long\r\nas I live, that land is rightfully the property of the people in common,\r\nand that private ownership of land is against natural justice, no matter\r\nby what civil or ecclesiastical laws it may be sanctioned; and I would\r\nbring about instantly, if I could, such change of laws all over the\r\nworld as would confiscate private property in land without one penny of\r\ncompensation to the miscalled owners.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no shuffling here. With logical precision Dr. M'Glynn strips\r\nMr. George's doctrine of its technical disguise as a form of taxation,\r\nand presents it to the world as a simple Confiscation of Rents. Many\r\nacute critics of _Progress and Poverty_ have failed to see that when\r\nMr. George calls upon the State to take over to itself, and to its own\r\nuses, the whole annual rental value of the bare land of a country, the\r\nland, that is, irrespectively of improvements put upon it by man, he\r\nproposes not \"a single tax upon land\" at all, but an actual confiscation\r\nof the rental of the land--which for practical purposes is the land--to\r\nthe uses of the State, without a levy, and without compensation to \"the\r\nmiscalled owners.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a tax is levied, the need by the State levying it of a certain sum\r\nof money must first be ascertained by competent authority, legislative\r\nor executive, as the case may be, and the law-making power must then,\r\naccording to a prescribed form, enact that to raise such a sum a certain\r\ntax shall be levied on designated property or occupations. If the\r\nexigencies of the State are held to require it, a tax may be levied upon\r\nproperty of more than its value, as in the case, for example, of the\r\ncustoms duty which was imposed in one of our \"tariff revisions\" upon\r\nplate glass imported into the United States by way of \"protecting\" a\r\nsingle plate-glass factory then existing in the United States. This was\r\nan abominable abuse of a constitutional power, but it was not\r\n\"confiscation.\" What Henry George proposes is confiscation, as Dr.\r\nM'Glynn plainly sees and courageously says. What he proposes is that\r\nthe State shall compel the annual rental value of all land to be paid\r\ninto the public treasury, without regard to the question whether the\r\nState does or does not need such a sum of money. That is confiscation\r\npure and simple, the State, in the assumed interest of the State,\r\nproceeding against the private owners of land, or the \"miscalled\r\nowners,\" to use Dr. M'Glynn's significant phrase, precisely as under the\r\nfeudal system the State proceeded against the private property of rebels\r\nand traitors. No good reason can be shown why the process should not be\r\napplied to personalty and to debts as well as to land.\r\n\r\nThis was the doctrine indorsed at the polls in New York in November 1886\r\nby 68,000 voters. Nor can there be much doubt that it would have been\r\nindorsed by the few thousand more votes needed to defeat Mr. Hewitt, the\r\nactual Mayor of New York, and to put Mr. Henry George into the Chief\r\nMagistracy of the first city of the New World, had not its teachers and\r\npreachers been confronted by the quiet, cool, and determined prelate who\r\nmet it as plainly as it was put. \"Your letter,\" said the Archbishop,\r\n\"has brought the painful intelligence that you decline to go to Rome,\r\nand that you have taught, and will continue to teach, the injustice of\r\nprivate ownership of land, no matter by what laws of Church or State it\r\nmay be sanctioned. In view of such declarations, to permit you to\r\nexercise the holy ministry would be manifestly wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIn these few words of the Archbishop of New York, we have plainly\r\naffirmed in 1886 the principle underlying the Papal Decree of 1888\r\nagainst the Plan of Campaign and Boycotting in Ireland. There is no\r\nquestion of parties or of politics in the one case or in the other. When\r\nDr. M'Glynn talked about the private ownership of land in New York as\r\n\"against natural justice,\" he flung himself not only against the Eighth\r\nCommandment and the teachings of the Catholic Church, touching the\r\nrights of property, but against the constitutions of the State of New\r\nYork and of the United States. That \"private property shall not be taken\r\nfor public uses without just compensation\" is a fundamental provision of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, which is itself a part of the\r\nConstitution of every State of the Union; and the right of private\r\nownership in land is defined and protected beyond doubt or cavil in New\r\nYork under the State Constitution. An Act passed in 1830 provides and\r\ndeclares that all lands within the State \"are allodial, so that, subject\r\nonly to the liability to escheat, the entire and absolute property is\r\nvested in the owners according to the nature of their respective\r\nestates.\"\r\n\r\nBy this Act \"all feudal tenures of every description, with all their\r\nincidents,\" were \"abolished.\" Most of the \"feudal incidents\" of the\r\nsocage tenure had been previously abolished by an Act passed in 1787,\r\nunder the first Constitution of the State, adopted at Kingston in 1777,\r\na year after the Declaration of American Independence; and socage tenure\r\nby fixed and determinate service, not military or variable by the lord\r\nat his will, had been adopted long before by an Act of the first\r\nAssembly of the Province of New York held in 1691 under the first Royal\r\nGovernor, after the reconquest of the province from Holland, and in the\r\nreign of William and Mary. This Act provided that all lands should \"be\r\nheld in free and common socage according to the tenure of East Greenwich\r\nin England.\" It is an interesting circumstance that the right of private\r\nownership in land, thus rooted in our history, should have been defended\r\nagainst a threatening revolutionary movement in New York by the courage\r\nand loyalty to the Constitution of his country as well as to his Church\r\nof a Catholic Archbishop. For this same Assembly of the Province of New\r\nYork in 1693, in an Act \"to maintain Protestant ministers and churches,\"\r\nenacted that \"every Jesuit and popish priest\" found in the Province\r\nafter a certain day named, should be put into \"perpetual imprisonment,\"\r\nwith the proviso that if he escaped and was retaken he should suffer\r\ndeath. And even in the Constitution of 1777 the Protestantism of New\r\nYork expressed its hostility to the Catholic Church by exacting\r\nsubjection \"in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of the Archbishop, both as a churchman and as a citizen,\r\nwas impregnable. When Dr. M'Glynn advocated the plan of Henry George, he\r\nadvocated at one and the same time the immoral seizure and confiscation\r\nof the whole income of many persons within the protection of the\r\nConstitution of New York, and the overthrow of the Constitution of that\r\nState and of the United States. It may be within the competency of the\r\nBritish Parliament to enact such a confiscation of rent without a\r\nrevolution, there being not only no allodial tenure of land in Great\r\nBritain, but, it would appear, no limit to the power of a British\r\nParliament over the lives, liberties, and property of British subjects,\r\nbut the will of its members. But it is not within the competency of the\r\nCongress of the United States, or of the Assembly of New York, to do\r\nsuch a thing, the powers of these bodies being controlled and denned by\r\nwritten Constitutions, which can only be altered or amended in a\r\nprescribed manner and through prescribed and elaborate forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October 1886 it became clear that Mr. George, whose\r\ncandidacy had at first been regarded with indifference by the party\r\nmanagers, both Democratic and Republican, in New York, would command a\r\nvote certainly larger than that of one of these parties, and possibly\r\nlarger than that of either of them. To put him at the head of a poll of\r\nthree parties would elect him. This was so apparent that he and his\r\nfriends, including Dr. M'Glynn and Mr. Davitt, were warranted in\r\nexpecting a victory.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly therefore by a mere coincidence that this precise time was\r\nselected for opening the war in Ireland against Rent. It is quite\r\npossible that if Mr. Dillon and his Parliamentary friends had been in\r\nless of a hurry to open this war before the return of Mr. Davitt from\r\nAmerica, it might have been opened in a manner less \"politically\r\nstupid,\" if not less \"morally wrong.\" But, of course, if Mr. Henry\r\nGeorge had been elected Mayor of New York, as he came so near to being\r\nin November 1886, and Mr. Davitt had returned to Ireland with the\r\nprestige of contributing to place him in the municipal chair of the most\r\nimportant city in the New World, Mr. Dillon and his Parliamentary\r\nfriends would probably have found it necessary to accept a much less\r\nconspicuous part in the conduct of the campaign.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 17th of October 1886 that Mr. John Dillon, M.P., first\r\npromulgated the \"Plan of Campaign\" at Portumna, in a speech which was\r\npromptly flashed under the Atlantic to New York, there to feed the\r\nflame, already fanned by the eloquence of Dr. M'Glynn, into a blaze of\r\nenthusiasm for the apostle of the New Gospel of Confiscation.\r\n\r\nHad the \"Plan of Campaign\" then been met by the highest local authority\r\nof the Catholic Church in Ireland, as Henry George's doctrine of\r\nConfiscation was met in New York by Archbishop Corrigan, it might never\r\nhave been necessary to issue the Papal Decree of April 1888. But while\r\nthe Bishop of Limerick unhesitatingly denounced the \"Plan of Campaign\"\r\nas \"politically stupid and morally wrong,\" the Archbishop of Dublin\r\nbestowed upon it what may be called a left-handed benediction. Admitting\r\nthat it empowered one of the parties to a contract to \"fix the terms on\r\nwhich that contract should continue in force,\" the Archbishop actually\r\ncondoned the claim of this immoral power by the tenant, on the ground\r\nthat the same immoral power had been theretofore exercised by the\r\nlandlord! Peter having robbed Paul from January to July, that is, Paul\r\nshould be encouraged by his spiritual guides to rob Peter from July to\r\nJanuary!\r\n\r\nThat the Catholic Church should even seem for a time to speak with two\r\nvoices on such a point as the moral quality of political machinery, or\r\nthat speaking with one voice upon such a point in America, it should\r\neven seem to speak with another voice in Ireland, would clearly be a\r\ndisaster to the Church and to civilisation. From the moment therefore,\r\nin 1886, when the issue between Dr. M'Glynn and the Archbishop of New\r\nYork was defined, as I have shown, and the Irish National League, with a\r\nquasi-indorsement from the Archbishop of Dublin, had arrayed itself\r\npractically and openly on the side of Dr. M'Glynn and against the\r\nArchbishop of New York, interests far transcending those of any\r\npolitical party in Ireland, in Great Britain, or in the United States,\r\nwere involved. Unfortunately for the immediate and decisive settlement\r\nby Rome of the issue between Dr. M'Glynn and the Archbishop of New York,\r\na certain vague but therefore more vexatious measure of countenance had\r\nbeen given, before that issue was raised, to the theories of Mr. Henry\r\nGeorge by another American prelate, the Cardinal Archbishop of\r\nBaltimore, and by more than one eminent ecclesiastic in Europe. Of\r\ncourse this would have been impossible had these ecclesiastics\r\npenetrated, like Dr. M'Glynn, to the heart of Mr. George's contention,\r\nor discerned with the acumen of the Archbishop of New York the\r\nfundamental difference between any imaginable exercise of the power of\r\ntaxation by a Constitutional Government, and Mr. George's doctrine of\r\nthe Confiscation of Rent. But this having occurred, it was inevitable\r\nthat Rome, which has to deal with a world-wide and complex system of the\r\nmost varied and delicate human affairs, should proceed in the matter\r\nwith infinite patience and care. In January 1887 the Propaganda\r\naccordingly cabled thus to the Archbishop of New York,--Dr. M'Glynn\r\npersisting in his refusal to go to Rome--\"for prudential reasons\r\nPropaganda has heretofore postponed action in the case of Dr. M'Glynn.\r\nThe Sovereign Pontiff has now taken the matter into his own hands.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hands of his Holiness the matter was safe; and in the Papal\r\nDecree of April 20, 1888, we have at once the most conclusive\r\nvindication of the wisdom and courage shown by the Archbishop of New\r\nYork in 1886, and the most emphatic condemnation of the attitude assumed\r\nin 1886 by the Archbishop of Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that Mr. George has been finally defeated in\r\nAmerica. On the contrary, he was never more active. A legacy left to\r\nhim by an Irish-American for the propagation of his doctrines has just\r\nbeen declared by the Vice-Chancellor of New Jersey, to be invalid on the\r\nground that George's doctrines are \"in opposition to the laws\"; and this\r\ndecision has bred an uproar in the press which is reviving popular\r\nattention all over the country to the doctrines and to their author. He\r\nis astute, persevering, as much in earnest as Mr. Davitt, and as\r\nfamiliar with the weak points in the political machinery of the United\r\nStates as is Mr. Davitt with the weak points in the political machinery\r\nof Great Britain. This is a Presidential year. The election of 1888 will\r\nbe decided, as was the election of 1884, in New York. The Democratic\r\nparty go into the contest with a New York candidate, President\r\nCleveland, who was presented to the Convention at St. Louis for\r\nnomination, not by an Irishman from New York, but by an Irishman from\r\nthe hopelessly Republican State of Pennsylvania, and whose renomination,\r\ndistasteful to the Democratic Governor of the State, was also openly\r\nopposed by the Democratic Mayor of the city of New York, Mr. Hewitt, Mr.\r\nGeorge's successful competitor in the Municipal election of 1886.\r\nLeaving Dr. M'Glynn to uphold the Confiscation of Land against the Pope\r\nin New York, as Mr. Davitt, Mr. Dillon, and a certain number of Irish\r\npriests uphold the Plan of Campaign and Boycotting against the Pope in\r\nIreland, Mr. George supports President Cleveland, and in so doing\r\ncleverly makes a flank movement towards his \"exclusive taxation of\r\nland,\" by promoting, under the cover of \"Revenue Reform,\" an attack on\r\nthe indirect taxation from which the Federal Revenues are now mainly\r\nderived. Meanwhile the Cardinal Archbishop of Baltimore, who is also a\r\npolitical supporter of President Cleveland, has not yet been confronted\r\nby the supreme authority at Rome with such a final sentence upon the\r\ntrue nature of Mr. George's \"exclusive taxation of land,\" as the\r\nclear-sighted Archbishop of New York is said to be seeking to obtain\r\nfrom the Holy Office. What the end will be I have little doubt. But for\r\nthe moment, it will be seen, the situation in America is only less\r\nconfused and troublesome than the situation in Ireland. It is confused\r\nand troubled too, as I have tried in this prologue to show, by forces\r\nidentical in character with those which confuse and trouble the\r\nsituation in Ireland.\r\n\r\nOf the social conditions amid and against which those forces are working\r\nin America, I believe myself to have some knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo get an actual touch and living sense of the social conditions amid\r\nand against which they are working in Ireland was my object, I repeat,\r\nin making the visits, of which this book is a record. More than this I\r\ncould not hope, in the time at my disposal, to do. With very much less\r\nthan this, it appears to me, many persons, whose views of Irish affairs\r\nI had been inclined, before making these visits, to regard with respect,\r\nmust have found it possible to rest content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Monday, Jan. 30, 1888._--I left London last night. The train\r\nwas full of people going to attend levees and drawing-rooms about to be\r\nheld at Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\nNear Watford we lost half an hour by the breaking of a connecting-rod:\r\nbut the London and North-Western is a model railway, and we ran\r\nalongside the pier at Holyhead exactly \"on time.\" There is no such\r\nrailway travelling in America, excepting on the Pennsylvania Central;\r\nand the North-Western sleeping-carriages, if less monumental and\r\nelaborate than ours, are better ventilated, and certainly not less\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI had expected to come upon unusual things and people in Ireland, but I\r\nhad not expected to travel thither in company with an Irish Jacobite.\r\nTwo of my fellow-passengers, chatting as they smoked their cigarettes\r\nin the little vestibule between the cabins of the carriage, had much to\r\nsay about Lord Ashburnham, and the \"Order of the White Rose,\" and the\r\nGrand Mass to be celebrated to-morrow morning at the Church of the\r\nCarmelites in London, in memory of Charles Edward Stuart, who died at\r\nRome in 1788, and now lies buried as Charles III., King of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, in the vaults of the Vatican, together with his father\r\n\"James III.,\" and his brother \"Henry IX.\" One of the two was as hot and\r\nearnest about the \"Divine Right of Kings\" as the parson who, less than\r\nforty years ago, preached a sermon to prove that the great cholera\r\nvisitation of 1849 was a direct chastisement of the impiety of the Royal\r\nMint in dropping the letters D.G. from the first florins of Queen\r\nVictoria issued in that year. He bewailed his sad fate in being called\r\nover to Ireland by family affairs at such a moment, and evidently did\r\nnot know that the Mass in question had been countermanded by the\r\nCardinal Archbishop.\r\n\r\nThe incident, odd enough in itself, interested me the more that\r\nyesterday, as it happens, the Cardinal had spoken with me of this\r\ncurious affair.\r\n\r\nHe heard of it for the first time on Saturday, and, sending at once for\r\nthe priest in charge of the Carmelite Church, forbade the celebration.\r\nLater on in the evening, two strangers came to the Archbishop's house,\r\nand in great agitation besought him to allow the arrangements for the\r\nMass to go on. He declined to do this, and sent them away impaled on a\r\ndilemma. \"What you propose,\" said the Cardinal, \"is either a piece of\r\ntheatrical tomfoolery, in which case it is unfit to be performed in a\r\nchurch, or it is flat treason, in which case you should be sent to the\r\nTower!\"\r\n\r\nThey went away, like the Senatus of Augsburg from the presence of\r\nNapoleon--\"_très mortifiés et peu contents_.\" After they had gone, the\r\nCardinal remembered that for some time past queer documents had reached\r\nhim through the post-office, setting forth the doctrine of Divine Right,\r\nand the story of the Stuarts. One of these, which with the rest he had\r\nthrown into the fire, was an elaborate genealogical chart, designed to\r\nshow that the crowns of Great Britain and Ireland ought rightfully to be\r\nworn by a certain princess in Bavaria!\r\n\r\nIf there is anything more in all this than a new variety of the \"blue\r\nChina craze,\" may it not be taken as a symptom of that vague but clearly\r\ngrowing dissatisfaction with the nineteenth century doctrine of\r\ngovernment by mere majorities, which is by no means confined to Europe?\r\nThis feeling underlies the \"National Association\" for getting a preamble\r\nput into the Constitution of the United States, \"recognising Almighty\r\nGod as the source of all authority and power in Civil Government.\" There\r\nwas such a recognition in the Articles of Confederation of 1781.\r\nArchbishop Ryan of Philadelphia should have mentioned to His Holiness\r\nthe existence of this Association, when he presented to Leo XIII., the\r\nother day at Rome, President Cleveland's curious Jubilee gift of an\r\nemblazoned copy of what a Monsignore of my acquaintance calls \"the\r\ngodless American Constitution.\"[8]\r\n\r\nWe made a quick quiet passage to Kingstown. These boats--certainly the\r\nbest appointed of their sort afloat--are owned, I find, in Dublin, and\r\nmanaged exclusively by their Irish owners, to whom the credit therefore\r\nbelongs of making the mail service between Holyhead and Kingstown as\r\nadmirable, in all respects, as the mail services between Dover and the\r\nContinental ports are not.\r\n\r\nI landed at Kingstown with Lord Ernest Hamilton, M.P. for North Tyrone,\r\nwith whom I have arranged an expedition to Gweedore in Donegal, one of\r\nthe most ill-famed of the \"congested districts\" of Ireland, and just now\r\nmade a point of special interest by the arrest of Father M'Fadden, the\r\nparish priest of the place, for \"criminally conspiring to compel and\r\ninduce certain tenants not to fulfil their legal obligations.\"\r\n\r\nI could understand such a prosecution as this in America, where the\r\nConstitution makes it impossible even for Congress to pass laws\r\n\"impairing the validity of contracts.\" But as the British Parliament has\r\nbeen passing such laws for Ireland ever since Mr. Butt in 1870 raised\r\nthe standard of Irish Land Reform under the name of Home Rule, it seems\r\na little absurd, not to say Hibernian, of the British authorities to\r\nprosecute Father M'Fadden merely for bettering their own instruction in\r\nhis own way. I could better understand a prosecution of Father M'Fadden\r\non such grounds by the authorities of his own Church.\r\n\r\nA step from the boat at Kingstown puts you into the train for Dublin.\r\nBefore we got into motion, a weird shape as of one just escaped from\r\nthe Wild West show of Buffalo Bill peered in at the window, inviting us\r\nto buy the morning papers, or a copy of \"the greatest book ever\r\npublished, 'Paddy at Home!'\" This proved to be a translation of M. de\r\nMandat Grancey's lively volume, _Chez Paddy_. The vendor, \"Davy,\" is one\r\nof the \"chartered libertines\" of Dublin. He is supposed to be, and I\r\ndare say is, a warm Nationalist, but he has a keen eye to business, and\r\nalertly suits his cries to his customers. Recognising the Conservative\r\nmember for North Tyrone, he promptly recommended us to buy the _Irish\r\nTimes_ and the _Express_ as \"the two best papers in all Ireland.\" But he\r\nsmiled approval when I asked for the _Freeman's Journal_ also, in which\r\nI found a report of a speech delivered yesterday by Mr. Davitt at\r\nRathkeale, chiefly remarkable for a sensible protest against the\r\nridiculous and rantipole abuse lavished upon Mr. Balfour by the\r\nNationalist orators and newspapers. I am not surprised to see this. Mr.\r\nDavitt has the stuff in him of a serious revolutionary leader, and no\r\nsuch man can stomach the frothy and foolish vituperation to which\r\nparliamentary agitators are addicted, not in Ireland only. Unlike Mr.\r\nParnell, who is forced to have one voice for New York and Cincinnati,\r\nand another voice for Westminster, Mr. Davitt is free to be always\r\navowedly bent on bringing about a thorough Democratic revolution in\r\nIreland. I believe him to be too able a man to imagine, as some of the\r\nIrish agitators do, that this can be done without the consent of\r\nDemocratic England, and he has lived too much in England, and knows the\r\nEnglish democracy too well, I suspect, not to know that to abuse an\r\nexecutive officer for determination and vigour is the surest way to make\r\nhim popular. Calling Mr. Forster \"Buckshot\" Forster did him no harm. On\r\nthe contrary, the epithet might have helped him to success had not Mr.\r\nGladstone given way behind him at the most critical moment of his\r\ngrapple with the revolutionary organisation in Ireland. We hear a great\r\ndeal about resistance to tyrants being obedience to God, but I fear that\r\nobedience to God is not the strongest natural passion of the human\r\nheart, and I doubt whether resistance to tyrants can often be promoted\r\nby putting about a general conviction that the tyrant has a thumping big\r\nstick in his hand, and may be relied upon to use it. Even Tom Paine had\r\nthe wit to see that it was his \"good heart\" which brought Louis XVI. to\r\nthe scaffold.\r\n\r\nNobody who had not learned from the speeches made in England, and the\r\ncable despatches sent to America, that freedom of speech and of the\r\npress has been brutally trampled under foot in Ireland by a \"Coercion\"\r\nGovernment would ever suspect it from reading the Dublin papers which I\r\nthis morning bought.\r\n\r\nAs a Democratic journalist I had some practical knowledge of a true\r\n\"Coercion\" government in America a quarter of a century ago. The\r\nAmerican editor who had ventured in 1862 to publish in a New York or\r\nPhiladelphia newspaper a letter from Washington, speaking of the\r\nUnionist Government by President Lincoln, as the letter from London\r\npublished to-day in the _Freeman's Journal_ speaks of the Unionist\r\nGovernment of Lord Salisbury, would have found himself in one of the\r\ncasemates of Fort Lafayette within twenty-four hours. Our Republican\r\nrulers acted upon the maxim laid down by Mr. Tilden's friend, Montgomery\r\nBlair,[9] that \"to await the results of slow judicial prosecution is to\r\nallow crime to be consummated, with the expectation of subsequent\r\npunishment, instead of preventing its accomplishment by prompt and\r\ndirect interference.\" Perhaps Americans take their Government more\r\nseriously than Englishmen do. Certainly we stand by it more sternly in\r\nbad weather. Even so good a Constitutionalist as Professor Parsons at\r\nHarvard, I remember, when a student asked him if he would not suspend\r\nthe _Habeas Corpus_ in the case of a man caught hauling down the\r\nAmerican flag, promptly replied, \"I would not suspend the _Habeas\r\nCorpus_; I would suspend the _Corpus_.\"\r\n\r\nWe found no \"hansoms\" at the Dublin Station, only \"outside cars,\" and\r\ncabs much neater than the London four-wheelers. One of these brought us\r\nat a good pace to Maple's Hotel in Kildare Street, a large,\r\nold-fashioned but clean and comfortable house. My windows look down upon\r\na stately edifice of stone erecting on Kildare Street for all sorts of\r\neducational and \"exhibitional\" purposes, with the help of an Imperial\r\ngrant, I am told, and to be called the Leinster Hall. The style is\r\ndecidedly composite, with colonnades and loggie and domes and porticos,\r\nand recalls the ancient Roman buildings depicted in that fresco of a\r\nbelated slave-girl knocking at her mistress's door which with its\r\ncompanion pieces is fast fading away upon the walls of the \"House of\r\nLivia\" on the Palatine.\r\n\r\nAt one end of this street is the fashionable and hospitable Kildare\r\nStreet Club; at the other the Shelburne Hotel, known to all Americans.\r\nThis seems to have been \"furbished-up\" since I last saw it. There, for\r\nthe last time as it proved, I saw and had speech of my friend of many\r\nyears, the prince of all preachers in our time, Father Burke of Tallaght\r\nand of San Clemente.\r\n\r\nI had telegraphed to him from London that I should halt in Dublin for a\r\nday, on my way to America, to see him. He came betimes, to find me\r\nalmost as badly-off as St. Lawrence upon his gridiron. The surgeon whom\r\nthe hotel people had hastily summoned to relieve me from a sudden attack\r\nof that endemic Irish ecstasy, the lumbago, had applied what he called\r\nthe \"heroic treatment\" on my telling him that I had no time to be ill,\r\nbut must spend that day with Father Burke, dine that night with Mr.\r\nIrving and Mr. Toole, and go on the next day to America.\r\n\r\n\"What has this Inquisitor done to you?\" queried Father Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Cauterised me with chloroform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's a modern improvement! Let me see--\" and, scrutinising the\r\nresults, he said, with a merry twinkle in his deep, dark eyes--\"I see\r\nhow it is! They brought you a veterinary!\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1878. On that too brief, delightful morning, we talked of\r\nall things--supralunar, lunar, and sublunary. Much of Wales, I remember,\r\nwhere he had been making a visit. \"A glorious country,\" he said, \"and\r\nthe Welsh would have been Irish, only they lost the faith.\" Full of love\r\nfor Ireland as he was, he was beginning then to be troubled by symptoms\r\nin the Nationalist movement, which could not be regarded with composure\r\nby one who, in his youth at Rome, had seen, with me, the devil of\r\nextremes drive Italy down a steep place into the sea.\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards I landed at Queenstown, in July 1883, intending to\r\nvisit him at Tallaght. But when the letter which I sent to announce my\r\ncoming reached the monastery, the staunchest Soldier of the Church in\r\nIreland lay there literally \"dead on the field of honour.\" Chatham, in\r\nthe House of Lords, John Quincy Adams, in the House of Representatives,\r\nfell in harness, but neither death so speaks to the heart as the simple\r\nand sublime self-sacrifice of the great Dominican, dragging himself from\r\nhis dying bed into Dublin to spend the last splendour of his genius and\r\nhis life for the starving children of the poor in Donegal.\r\n\r\nWhat would I not give for an hour with him now!\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I went out to find Mr. Davitt, hoping he might suggest\r\nsome way of seeing the Nationalist meeting on Wednesday night without\r\nundergoing the dismal penance of sitting out all the speeches. I wished\r\nalso to ask him why at Rathkeale he talked about the Dunravens as\r\n\"absentees.\" He was born in Lord Lucan's country, and may know little of\r\nLimerick, but he surely ought to know that Adare Manor was built of\r\nIrish materials, and by Irish workmen, under the eye of Lord Dunraven,\r\nall the finest ornamental work, both in wood and in stone, of the\r\nmansion, being done by local mechanics; and also that the present owners\r\nof Adare spend a large part of every year in the country, and are\r\ndeservedly popular. He was not to be found at the National League\r\nheadquarters, nor yet at the Imperial Hotel, which is his usual resort,\r\nas Morrison's is the resort of Mr. Parnell. So I sent him a note through\r\nthe Post-Office.\r\n\r\n\"You had better seal it with wax,\" said a friend, in whose chambers I\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! all the letters to well-known people that are not opened by the\r\npolice are opened by the Nationalist clerks in the Post-Offices. 'Tis a\r\nway we've always had with us in Ireland!\"\r\n\r\nI had some difficulty in finding the local habitation of the \"National\r\nLeague.\" I had been told it was in O'Connell Street, and sharing the\r\nusual and foolish aversion of my sex to asking questions on the highway,\r\nI perambulated a good many streets and squares before I discovered that\r\nit has pleased the local authorities to unbaptize Sackville Street, \"the\r\nfinest thoroughfare in Europe,\" and convert it into \"O'Connell Street.\"\r\nBut they have failed so ignominiously that the National League finds\r\nitself obliged to put up a huge sign over its doorways, notifying all\r\nthe world that the offices are not where they appear to be in Upper\r\nSackville Street at all, but in \"O'Connell Street.\" The effect is as\r\nludicrous as it is instructive. Oddly enough, they have not attempted to\r\nchange the name of another thoroughfare which keeps green the \"pious and\r\nimmortal memory\" of William III., dear to all who in England or America\r\ngo in fear and horror of the scarlet woman that sitteth upon the seven\r\nhills! There is a fashion, too, in Dublin of putting images of little\r\nwhite horses into the fanlights over the doorways, which seems to smack\r\nof an undue reverence for the Protestant Succession and the House of\r\nHanover.\r\n\r\nWhat you expect is the thing you never find in Ireland. I had rather\r\nthoughtlessly taken it for granted the city would be agog with the great\r\nMorley reception which is to come off on Wednesday night. There is a\r\ngood deal about it in the _Freeman's Journal_ to-day, but chiefly\r\ntouching a sixpenny quarrel which has sprung up between the Reception\r\nCommittee and the Trades Council over the alleged making of contracts by\r\nthe Committee with \"houses not employing members of the regular trades.\"\r\n\r\nFor this the typos and others propose to \"boycott\" the Committee and the\r\nReception and the Liberators from over the sea. From casual\r\nconversations I gather that there is much more popular interest in the\r\nrelease, on Wednesday, of Mr. T.D. Sullivan, ex-Lord Mayor, champion\r\nswimmer, M.P., poet, and patriot. A Nationalist acquaintance of mine\r\ntells me that in Tullamore Mr. Sullivan has been most prolific of\r\npoetry. He has composed a song which I am afraid will hardly please my\r\nIrish Nationalist friends in America:\r\n\r\n   \"We are sons of Sister Isles,\r\n    Englishmen and Irishmen,\r\n    On our friendship Heaven smiles;\r\n    Tyrant's schemes and Tory wiles\r\n    Ne'er shall make us foes again.\"\r\n\r\nThere is to be a Drawing-Room, too, at the Castle on Wednesday night.\r\nOne would not unnaturally gather from the \"tall talk\" in Parliament and\r\nthe press that this conjuncture of a great popular demonstration in\r\nfavour of Irish nationality, with a display of Dublin fashion doing\r\nhomage to the alien despot, might be ominous of \"bloody noses and\r\ncracked crowns.\" Not a bit of it! I asked my jarvey, for instance, on an\r\noutside car this afternoon, whether he expected a row to result from\r\nthese counter currents of the classes and the masses. \"A row!\" he\r\nreplied, looking around at me in amazement. \"A row is it? and what for\r\nwould there be? Shure they'll be through with the procession in time to\r\nsee the carriages!\"\r\n\r\nObviously he saw nothing in either show to offend anybody; though he\r\ncould clearly understand that an intelligent citizen might be vexed if\r\nhe found himself obliged to sacrifice one of them in order to fully\r\nenjoy the other.\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry, it seems, is not yet well enough to cross the Channel;\r\nbut the Duchess of Marlborough, who is staying here with her nephew the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, has volunteered to assist him in holding the\r\nDrawing-Room, whereupon a grave question has arisen in Court circles as\r\nto whether the full meed of honours due to a Vice-Queen regnant ought to\r\nbe paid also to an ex-Vice-Queen. This is debated by the Dublin dames as\r\nhotly as official women in Washington fight over the eternal question of\r\nthe relative precedence due to the wives of Senators and \"Cabinet\r\nMinisters.\" It will be a dark day for the democracy when women get the\r\nsuffrage--and use it.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon to-day I met the Attorney-General, Mr. O'Brien, who, with\r\nprompt Irish hospitality, asked me to dine with him to-morrow night, and\r\nMr. Wilson of the London _Times_, an able writer on Irish questions from\r\nthe English point of view. Mr. Balfour, who was expected, did not\r\nappear, being detained by guests at his own residence in the Park.\r\n\r\nI went to see him in the afternoon at the Castle, and found him in\r\nexcellent spirits; certainly the mildest-mannered and most sensible\r\ndespot who ever trampled in the dust the liberties of a free people. He\r\nwas quite delightful about the abuse which is now daily heaped upon him\r\nin speeches and in the press, and talked about it in a casual dreamy way\r\nwhich reminded me irresistibly of President Lincoln, whom, if in nothing\r\nelse, he resembles alike in longanimity and in length of limb. He had\r\nseen Davitt's _caveat_, filed at Rathkeale, against the foolishness of\r\ntrying to frighten him out of his line of country by calling him bad\r\nnames. \"Davitt is quite right,\" he said, \"the thing must be getting to\r\nbe a bore to the people, who are not such fools as the speakers take\r\nthem to be. One of the stenographers told me the other day that they had\r\nto invent a special sign for the phrase 'bloody and brutal Balfour,' it\r\nis used so often in the speeches.\" About the prosecution of Father\r\nM'Fadden of Gweedore, he knew nothing beyond the evidence on which it\r\nhad been ordered. This he showed me. If the first duty of a government\r\nis to govern, which is the American if not the English way of looking at\r\nit, Father M'Fadden must have meant to get himself into trouble when he\r\nused such language as this to his people: \"I am the law in Gweedore; I\r\ndespise the recent Coercion Act; if I got a summons to-morrow, I would\r\nnot obey it.\" From language like this to the attitude of Father M'Glynn\r\nin New York, openly flouting the authority of the Holy See itself, is\r\nbut an easy and an inevitable step.\r\n\r\nNeither \"Home Rule\" nor any other \"Rule\" can exist in a country in which\r\nmen whose words carry any weight are suffered to take up such an\r\nattitude. It is just the attitude of the \"Comeouters\" in New England\r\nduring my college days at Harvard, when Parker Pillsbury and Stephen\r\nFoster used to saw wood and blow horns on the steps of the\r\nmeeting-houses during service, in order to free their consciences \"and\r\nprotest against the Sabbatarian laws.\"\r\n\r\nTo see a Catholic priest assume this attitude is almost as amazing as to\r\nsee an educated Englishman like Mr. Wilfrid Blunt trying to persuade\r\nIrishmen that Mr. Balfour made him the confidant of a grisly scheme for\r\ndoing sundry Irish leaders to death by maltreating them in prison.\r\n\r\nI see with pleasure that the masculine instincts of Mr. Davitt led him\r\nto allude to this nonsense yesterday at Rathkeale in a half\r\ncontemptuous way. Mr. Balfour spoke of it to-day with generosity and\r\ngood feeling. \"When I first heard of it,\" he said, \"I resented it, of\r\ncourse, as an outrageous imputation on Mr. Blunt's character, and\r\ndenounced it accordingly. What I have since learned leads me to fear\r\nthat he really may have said something capable of being construed in\r\nthis absurd sense, but if he did, it must have been under the\r\nexasperation produced by finding himself locked up.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the story of Mr. Balfour's meeting with Mr. Blunt very plainly\r\nand vigorously told, while I was staying the other day at Knoyle House,\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of Clouds, where the two were guests\r\nunder conditions which should be at least as sacred in the eyes of\r\nBritons as of Bedouins. In Wiltshire nobody seemed for a moment to\r\nsuppose it possible that Mr. Blunt can have really deceived himself as\r\nto the true nature of any conversation he may have had with Mr. Balfour.\r\nThis is paying a compliment to Mr. Blunt's common sense at the expense\r\nof his imagination. In any view of the case, to lie in wait at the lips\r\nof a fellow guest in the house of a common friend, for the counts of a\r\npolitical indictment against him, is certainly a proceeding, as Davitt\r\nsaid yesterday of Mr. Blunts tale of horror, quite \"open to question.\"\r\nBut, as Mr. Blunt himself has sung, \"'Tis conscience makes us sinners,\r\nnot our sin,\" and I have no doubt the author of the _Poems of Proteus_\r\nreally persuaded himself that he was playing lawn tennis and smoking\r\ncigarettes in Wiltshire with a modern Alva, cynically vain of his own\r\ndark and bloody designs. Now that he finds himself struck down by the\r\niron hand of this remorseless tyrant, why should he not cry aloud and\r\nwarn, not Ireland alone, but humanity, against the appalling crimes\r\nmeditated, not this time in the name of \"Liberty,\" but in the name of\r\nOrder?\r\n\r\nWhat especially struck me in talking with Mr. Balfour to-day was his\r\nobviously unaffected interest in Ireland as a country rather than in\r\nIreland as a cock-pit. It is the condition of Ireland, and not the\r\ngabble of parties at Westminster about the condition of Ireland, which\r\nis uppermost in his thoughts. This, I should say, is the best guarantee\r\nof his eventual success.\r\n\r\nThe weakest point of the modern English system of government by Cabinets\r\nsurely is the evanescent tenure by which every Minister holds his\r\nplace. Not only has the Cabinet itself no fixed term of office, being in\r\ntruth but a Committee of the Legislature clothed with executive\r\nauthority, but any member of the Cabinet may be forced by events or by\r\nintrigues to leave it. In this way Mr. Forster, when he filled the place\r\nnow held by Mr. Balfour, found himself driven into resigning it by Mr.\r\nGladstone's indisposition or inability to resist the peremptory pressure\r\nput upon the British Premier at a critical moment by our own Government\r\nin the spring of 1882. Mr. Balfour is in no such peril, perhaps. He is\r\nmore sure, I take it, of the support of Lord Salisbury and his\r\ncolleagues than Mr. Forster ever was of the support of Mr. Gladstone;\r\nand the \"Coercion\" law which it is his duty to administer contains no\r\nsuch sweeping and despotic clause as that provision in Mr. Gladstone's\r\n\"Coercion Act\" of 1881, under which persons claiming American\r\ncitizenship were arrested and indefinitely locked up on \"suspicion,\"\r\nuntil it became necessary for our Government, even at the risk of war,\r\nto demand their trial or release.\r\n\r\nBut if Mr. Balfour were Chief Secretary for Ireland \"on the American\r\nplan\"; if he held his office, that is, for a fixed term of years, and\r\ncared nothing for a renewal of the lease, he could not be more\r\npre-occupied than he seems to be with simply getting his executive duty\r\ndone, or less pre-occupied than he seems to be with what may be thought\r\nof his way of getting it done. If all executive officers were of this\r\nstrain, Parliamentary government might stand in the dock into which\r\nPrince Albert put it with more composure, and await the verdict with\r\nmore confidence. Surely if Ireland is ever to govern herself, she must\r\nlearn precisely the lesson which Mr. Balfour, I believe, is trying to\r\nteach her--that the duty of executive officers to execute the laws is\r\nnot a thing debateable, like the laws themselves, nor yet determinable,\r\nlike the enactment of laws, by taking the yeas and the nays. How well\r\nthis lesson shall be taught must depend, of course, very much upon the\r\nquality of the men who make up the machine of Government in Ireland.\r\nThat the Irish have almost as great a passion for office-holding as the\r\nSpanish, we long ago learned in New York, where the percentage of Irish\r\noffice-holders considerably exceeds the percentage of Irish citizens.\r\nAnd as all the witnesses agree that the Irish Government has for years\r\nbeen to an inordinate degree a Government by patronage, there must\r\ndoubtless be some reasonable ground for the very general impression that\r\n\"the Castle\" needs overhauling. It is not true, however, I find,\r\nalthough I have often heard it asserted in England, that the Irish\r\nGovernment is officered by Englishmen and Scotchmen exclusively. The\r\nmurdered Mr. Burke certainly was not an Englishman; and there is an\r\napparent predominance of Irishmen in the places of trust and power. That\r\nthings at the Castle cannot be nearly so bad, moreover, as we in America\r\nare asked to believe, would seem to be demonstrated by the affectionate\r\nadmiration with which Lord Spencer is now regarded by men like Mr.\r\nO'Brien, M.P., who only the other day seemed to regard him as an unfit\r\nsurvival of the Cities of the Plain. If what these men then said of him,\r\nand of the Castle generally, was even very partially true--or if being\r\nwholly false, these men believed it to be true--every man of them who\r\nnow touches Lord Spencer's hand is defiled, or defiles him.\r\n\r\nBut that concerns them. Their present attitude makes Lord Spencer a good\r\nwitness when he declares that the Civil servants of the Crown in\r\nIreland, called \"the Castle,\" are \"diligent, desire to do their duty\r\nwith impartiality, and to hold an even balance between opposing\r\ninterests in Ireland,\" and maintains that they \"will act with\r\nimpartiality and vigour if led by men who know their own minds, and\r\ndesire to be firm in the Government of the country.\" All this being\r\ntrue, Mr. Balfour ought to make his Government a success.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour introduced me to Sir West Ridgway, the successor of Sir\r\nRedvers Buller, who has been rewarded for the great services he did his\r\ncountry in Asia, by being flung into this seething Irish stew. He takes\r\nit very composedly, though the climate does not suit him, he says; and\r\nhas a quiet workmanlike way with him, which impresses one favourably at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nAll the disorderly part of Ireland (for disorder is far from being\r\nuniversal in Ireland) comes under his direct administration, being\r\ndivided into five divisions on the lines originally laid down in 1881 by\r\nMr. Forster. Over each of these divisions presides a functionary styled\r\na \"Divisional Magistrate.\" The title is not happily chosen, the powers\r\nof these officers being rather like those confided to a French Prefect\r\nthan like those which are associated in England and America with the\r\ntitle of a \"magistrate.\" They have no judicial power, and nothing to do\r\nwith the trial of offenders. Their business is to protect life and\r\nproperty, and to detect and bring to justice offenders against the law.\r\nThey can only be called Magistrates as the Executive of the United\r\nStates is sometimes called the \"Chief Magistrate.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous and trusted of these Divisional Magistrates,\r\nI find, is Colonel Turner, who was Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant,\r\nunder Lord Aberdeen. He is now denounced by the Irish Nationalists as a\r\nruthless tyrant. He was then denounced by the Irish Tories as a\r\nsympathiser with Home Rule. It is probable, therefore, that he must be a\r\nconscientious and loyal executive officer, who understands and acts upon\r\nthe plain lines of his executive duty.\r\n\r\nI dined to-night at the Castle, not in the great hall or banqueting-room\r\nof St. Patrick, which was designed by that connoisseur in magnificence,\r\nthe famous Lord Chesterfield, during his Viceroyalty, but in a very\r\nhandsome room of more moderate dimensions. Much of the semi-regal state\r\nobserved at the Castle in the days of the Georges has been put down with\r\nthe Battle-Axe Guards of the Lord-Lieutenant, and with the\r\nbasset-tables of the \"Lady-Lieutenant,\" as the Vice-queen used to be\r\ncalled. At dinner the Viceroy no longer drinks to the pious and immortal\r\nmemory of William III., or to the \"1st of July 1690.\" No more does the\r\nband play \"Lillibullero,\" and no longer is the pleasant custom\r\nmaintained, after a dinner to the city authorities of Dublin, of a\r\n\"loving cup\" passed around the table, into which each guest, as it\r\npassed, dropped a gold piece for the good of the household. Only so much\r\nceremonial is now observed as suffices to distinguish the residence of\r\nthe Queen's personal representative from that of a great officer of\r\nState, or an opulent subject of high rank.\r\n\r\nDublin Castle indeed is no more of a palace than it is of a castle. Its\r\nclaim to the latter title rests mainly on the fine old \"Bermingham\"\r\ntower of the time of King John; its claim to the former on the Throne\r\nRoom, the Council Chamber, and the Hall of St. Patrick already\r\nmentioned. This last is a very stately and sumptuous apartment. Just\r\ntwenty years ago the most brilliant banquet modern Dublin has seen was\r\ngiven in this hall by the late Duke of Abercorn to the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales, to celebrate the installation of the Prince as a\r\nKnight of St. Patrick. It is a significant fact, testified to by all\r\nthe most candid Irishmen I have ever known, that upon the occasion of\r\nthis visit to Ireland in 1868 the Prince and Princess were received with\r\nunbounded enthusiasm by the people of all classes. Yet only the year\r\nbefore, in 1867, the explosion of some gunpowder at Clerkenwell by a\r\nband of desperadoes, to the death and wounding of many innocent people,\r\nhad brought the question of the disestablishment of the Irish Church, in\r\nthe mind of Mr. Gladstone, within the domain of \"practical politics\"! By\r\nparity of reasoning, one would think, the reception of the heir-apparent\r\nand his wife in Ireland ought to have taken that question out of the\r\ndomain of \"practical politics.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, it is known, brought away from this visit an\r\nimpression that the establishment of a prince of the blood in Ireland,\r\nor a series of royal visits to Ireland, would go far towards pacifying\r\nthe relations between the two Islands. Mr. Gladstone thought his\r\nDisestablishment would quite do the work. Events have shown that Mr.\r\nGladstone made a sad mistake as to the effect of his measure. The pains\r\nwhich, I am told, were taken by Mr. Deasy, M.P., and others to organise\r\nhostile demonstrations at one or two points in the south of Ireland,\r\nduring a subsequent visit of the Prince and Princess, would seem to show\r\nthat in the opinion of the Nationalists themselves, the impression of\r\nthe Prince was more accurate than were the inferences of the Premier.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing froward or formidable in the aspect of Dublin Castle.\r\nIt has neither a portcullis nor a drawbridge. People go in and out of it\r\nas freely as through the City Hall in New York. There is a show of\r\nsentries at the main entrance, and in one of the courts this morning the\r\npicturesque band of a Scotch regiment was playing to the delectation of\r\na small but select audience of urchins and little girls. A Dublin mob,\r\nnever so little in earnest and led by a dozen really determined men,\r\nought to be able to make as short work of it as the hordes of the\r\nFaubourgs in Paris made of the Bastille, with its handful of invalids,\r\non that memorable 14th of July, about which so many lies have passed\r\ninto history, and so much effervescent nonsense is still annually talked\r\nand printed.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Castle as it existed when the Irish Parliaments\r\nsat there under Elizabeth, and just before the last Catholic Viceroy\r\nmade Protestantism penal, and planned the transformation of Ireland\r\ninto a French province, was burned in the time of James II. The Earl of\r\nArran then reported to his father that \"the king had lost nothing but\r\nsix barrels of gunpowder, and the worst castle in the worst situation in\r\nChristendom.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as at Ottawa, a viceregal dinner-table is set off by the neat\r\nuniforms and skyblue facings of the aides-de-camp and secretaries. For\r\nsome mysterious reason Lord Spencer put these officers into chocolate\r\ncoats with white facings. But the new order soon gave place to the old\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner to-night was Lord Ormonde, who is returning to London, but\r\nkindly promised to make arrangements for showing me at Kilkenny Castle\r\nthe muniment room of the Butlers, which contains one of the most\r\nvaluable private collections of charters and State papers in the realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Jan. 31._--I lunched to-day with Sir Michael Morris, the Lord\r\nChief Justice of Ireland, whom I had last seen in Rome at the Jubilee\r\nMass of His Holiness. Sir Michael is one of the recognised lights of\r\nsocial life and of the law in Dublin. While he was in Rome some one\r\nhighly commended him in the presence of that staunch Nationalist the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, who assented so far as to say, \"Yes, yes, there\r\nare worse fellows in Dublin than that Morris!\" It would be hard to find\r\na more typical Irishman of the better sort than Sir Michael, a man more\r\nsure, in the words of Sheridan, to \"carry his honour and his brogue\r\nunstained to the grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe brogue of Sir Michael, it is said, made his fortune in the House of\r\nCommons. It has hardly the glow which made the brogue of Father Burke a\r\nmemory as of music in the ears of all who heard it, and differs from\r\nthat miraculous gift of the tongue as a ripe wine of Bordeaux differs\r\nfrom a ripe wine of Burgundy. But to the ordinary brogue of the street\r\nand the stage, it is as is a Brane Mouton Rothschild of 1868 to the\r\ncasual Médoc of a Parisian restaurant. \"Do you know Father Healy?\" said\r\none of the company to whom I spoke of it; \"he was at a wedding with Sir\r\nMichael. As the happy pair drove off under the usual shower of rice and\r\nold slippers, Sir Michael said to the Father, 'How I wish I had\r\nsomething to throw after her!' 'Ah, throw your brogue after her,'\r\nreplied the Father.\"\r\n\r\nThis brogue comes to Sir Michael lawfully enough. He belongs to one of\r\nthe fourteen tribes of Galway. His father, Mr. Martin Morris, was High\r\nSheriff of the County of Galway City in 1841, being the first Catholic\r\nwho had served that office since the time of Tyrconnel. His mother was a\r\nBlake of Galway, and the family seat, Spiddal, came to them through a\r\nFitzpatrick. \"Remember these things,\" said one of the guests to me, a\r\nCatholic from the south of Ireland, \"and remember that Sir Michael, like\r\nmyself, and, so far as I know, like every Irish Catholic in this room\r\nto-day, is a thoroughgoing Unionist, who would think it midsummer\r\nmadness to hand Ireland over to the 'Home Rule' of the 'uncrowned king,'\r\nMr. Parnell, who hasn't a drop, I believe, of Irish blood in his veins,\r\nand who, whatever else he may be, is certainly not a Catholic. Didn't\r\nParnell vote at first against religion and in favour of Bradlaugh? and\r\ndidn't he do this to force the bargain for the clerical franchise at the\r\nParliamentary conventions?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are some good Catholics, are there not,\" I answered, \"and\r\nsome good Christians, and of Irish blood too, among the associates of\r\nMr. Parnell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Associates!\" he exclaimed; \"if you know anything of Mr. Parnell, you\r\nmust know that he has no associates. He has followers, and he has\r\ninstruments, but he has no associates. The only Irishmen whom he has\r\nreally taken counsel with, or treated, I was about to say, with ordinary\r\ncivility, were Egan and Brennan. His manner with them was always\r\nconspicuously different from his cold and almost contemptuous bearing\r\ntowards the men whom he commands in Parliament, and Egan, who directs\r\nhis forces in your country, rewards him by calling him 'the great and\r\ngifted leader of _our_ race!' 'Our race' indeed! Parnell comes of the\r\nconquering race in Ireland, and he never forgets it, or lets his\r\nsubordinates forget it. I was in Galway when he came over there suddenly\r\nto quell the revolt organised by Healy. The rebels were at white-heat\r\nbefore he came. But he strode in among them like a huntsman among the\r\nhounds--marched Healy off into a little room, and brought him out again\r\nin ten minutes, cowed and submissive, but filled, as anybody can see,\r\never since, with a dull smouldering hate which will break out one of\r\nthese days, if a good and safe opportunity offers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you account, then,\" I asked, \"for the support which all these\r\nmen give Mr. Parnell?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the support which they give him!\" exclaimed my new acquaintance,\r\n\"for the support they give him! Bless your heart, my dear sir, it is he\r\ngives them the support! Barring Biggar, who, to do him justice, is as\r\nfree with his pocket as he is with his tongue--and no man can say more\r\nfor anybody than that--barring Biggar and M'Kenna and M'Carthy, and\r\nperhaps a dozen more, all these men are nominated by Mr. Parnell, and\r\ndraw salaries from the body he controls; they are paid members, like the\r\nworking-men members. Support indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the constituencies,\" I urged, \"surely the voters must know and care\r\nsomething about their representatives?\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from the south of Ireland laughed aloud. \"Very clear it\r\nis,\" he said, \"that you have made your acquaintance with my dear\r\ncountrymen in America, or in England perhaps--not in Ireland. Look at\r\nThurles, in January '85! The voters selected O'Ryan; Parnell ordered him\r\noff, and made them take O'Connor! The voters take their members to-day\r\nfrom the League--that is, from Mr. Parnell, just as they used to take\r\nthem from the landlords. What Lord Clanricarde said in Galway, when he\r\nmade all those fagot votes by cutting up his farms, that he could return\r\nhis grey mare to Parliament if he liked, Mr. Parnell can say with just\r\nas much truth to-day of any Nationalist seat in the country. I tell\r\nyou, the secret of his power is that he understands the Irish people,\r\nand how to ride them. He is a Protestant-ascendency man by blood, and he\r\nis fighting the unlucky devils of landlords to-day by the old 'landlord'\r\nmethods that came to him with his mother's milk--that is rightly\r\nspeaking, I should say, with his father's,\" and here he burst out\r\nlaughing at his own bull--\"for his mother, poor lady, she was an\r\nAmerican.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no harm at all! But did you ever know her? An odd woman she was,\r\nand is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her father,\" I replied, \"was a gallant American sailor of Scottish\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, and is it true that he got a great hatred of England from being\r\ncaptured in the _Chesapeake_ by the English Captain Broke? I always\r\nheard that.\"\r\n\r\nI explained that there were historical difficulties in the way of\r\naccepting this legend, and that Commodore Stewart's experiences, during\r\nthe war of 1812, had been those of a captor, not of a captive.\r\n\r\n\"Well, a clever woman she is, only very odd. She was a great terror, I\r\nremember, to a worthy Protestant parson, near Avondale; she used to come\r\nat him quite unexpectedly with such a power of theological discussion,\r\nand put him beside himself with questions he couldn't answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" I replied, \"but she has transferred her interest to\r\npolitics now; and she had the good sense, at the Chicago Convention in\r\n1886, to warn the physical-force men against showing their hand too\r\nplainly in support of her son.\"\r\n\r\nA curious conversation, as showing the personal bitterness of politics\r\nhere. It reminded me of Dr. Duche's description in his famous letter to\r\nWashington of the party which carried the Declaration of Independence\r\nthrough the Continental Congress. But it had a special interest for me\r\nas confirming the inferences I have often drawn as to Mr. Parnell's\r\nrelations with his party, from his singular and complete isolation among\r\nthem. I remember the profound astonishment of my young friend Mr. D----,\r\nof New York, who, as the son of, perhaps, the most conspicuous and\r\ninfluential American advocate of Home Rule, had confidently counted upon\r\nseeing Mr. Parnell in London, when he found that the most important\r\nmember of the Irish Parliamentary party, in point of position, was\r\nutterly unable to get at Mr. Parnell for him, or even to ascertain where\r\nMr. Parnell could be reached by letter.\r\n\r\nThough a staunch Unionist, Sir Michael is no blind admirer of things as\r\nthey are, nor even a thick-and-thin partisan of English rule in Ireland.\r\n\"If you will have the Irish difficulty in a nutshell,\" he is reported to\r\nhave said to a prosy British politician, \"here it is: It is simply a\r\nvery dull people trying to govern a very bright people.\"\r\n\r\nHe has quick and wide intellectual sympathies, or, as he put it to a\r\nlawyer who was kindly enlightening him about some matters of scientific\r\nnotoriety, \"I don't live in a cupboard myself.\" His own terse summing up\r\nof the Irish difficulty could hardly be better illustrated than by the\r\ncurrent story of the discomfiture of an English Treasury official, who\r\ncame into his official chambers to complain of the expenditure for fuel\r\nin the Court over which he presides. The Lord Chief-Justice looked at\r\nhim quietly while he set forth his errand, and then, ringing a bell on\r\nhis table, said to the servant who responded: \"Tell Mary the man has\r\ncome about the coals.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sir Michael's I had some conversation also with Mr. Justice Murphy,\r\nwho won a great reputation in connection with those murders in the\r\nPhoenix Park, which went near to breaking the heart and hope of poor\r\nFather Burke, and with Lord and Lady Ashbourne, whom I had not seen\r\nsince I met them some years ago under the hospitable roof of Lord\r\nHoughton. Lord Ashbourne was then Mr. Gibson, Q.C. He is now the Lord\r\nChancellor of Ireland, and the author of the Land Purchase Act of 1885,\r\nwhich many well-informed and sensible men regard as the Magna Charta of\r\npeace in Ireland, while others of equal authority assure me that by\r\nreversing the principle of the Bright clauses in the Act of 1871 it has\r\nencouraged the tenants to expect an eventual concession of the\r\nland-ownership to them on merely nominal terms.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, he is carped at and reviled almost as much by his\r\npolitical friends as by his political foes. In the time of Sir Michael\r\nHicks Beach I remember hearing Lord Ashbourne denounced most bitterly by\r\na leading Tory light as \"a Home Ruler in disguise, who had bedevilled\r\nthe Irish Question by undertaking to placate the country if it could be\r\nleft to be managed by him and by Lord Carnarvon.\"\r\n\r\nThe disguise appears to me quite impenetrable, and after my talk with\r\nhim, I remembered a characteristic remark about him made to me by Lord\r\nHoughton after he had gone away: \"A very clever man with a very clever\r\nwife. He ought to be on our side, but he has everything the Tories lack,\r\nso they have stolen him, and will make much of him, and keep him. But\r\none of these days he will do them some great service, and then they'll\r\nnever forgive him!\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashbourne went off early to look up some fine old wooden\r\nmantelpieces and wainscotings in the \"slums\" of Dublin. A brisk trade it\r\nseems has for some time been driven in such relics of the departed\r\nsplendour of the Irish capital. In the last century, when Dublin was\r\nfurther from London than London now is from New York, the Irish\r\nlandlords were more fond of living in Dublin than a good many of the\r\nIrish Nationalists I know now are. In this way the Iron Duke came to be\r\nborn in Dublin, where his father and mother had a handsome town house,\r\nwhereas when they went up to London they used to lodge, according to old\r\nLady Cork, \"over a pastry-cook's in Oxford Street.\" In those days there\r\nmust have been a good many fine solidly built and well decorated\r\nmansions in Dublin, of a type not unlike that of the ample rather\r\nstately and periwigged houses, all British brick without, and all Santo\r\nDomingo mahogany within, which, in my schoolboy days, used to give such\r\na dignified old-world air to Third and Fourth Streets in Philadelphia.\r\nIt is among such of these as are still standing, and have come to vile\r\nuses, that the foragers from London now find their harvest.\r\n\r\nFrom the Chief-Justice's I went with Lord Ernest Hamilton to a meeting\r\nof the Irish Unionists. Admission was by tickets, and the meeting\r\nevidently \"meant business.\" I suppose Presbyterian Ulster was largely\r\nrepresented: but Mr. Smith Barry of Fota Island, near Cork, one of the\r\nkindest and fairest, as well as one of the most determined and resolute,\r\nof the southern Irish landlords, was there, and the most interesting\r\nspeech I heard was made by a Catholic lawyer of Dublin, Mr. Quill, Q.C.,\r\nwho grappled with the question of distress among the Irish tenants, and\r\nproduced some startling evidence to show that this distress is by no\r\nmeans so great or so general as it is commonly assumed to be.[10] Able\r\nspeeches were also made by Mr. T.W. Russell, M.P. for Tyrone, and by\r\nColonel Saunderson, the champion of Ulster at Westminster. Both of these\r\nmembers, and especially Colonel Saunderson, \"went for\" their\r\nNationalist colleagues with an unparliamentary plainness of speech which\r\ncommanded the cordial sympathy of their audience. \"Is it possible,\"\r\nasked Colonel Saunderson, \"that you should ever consent, on any terms,\r\nto be governed by such--, well, by such wretches as these?\" to which the\r\naudience gave back an unanimous \"Never,\" neither thundered nor shouted,\r\nbut growled, like Browning's \"growl at the gates of Ghent,\"--a low deep\r\ngrowl like the final notice served by a bull-dog, which I had not heard\r\nsince the meetings which, at the North, followed the first serious\r\nfighting of the Civil War. I was much struck, too, by the prevalence\r\namong the audience of what may be called the Old Middle State type of\r\nAmerican face and head. A majority of these men might have come straight\r\nfrom those slopes of the Alleghany which, from Pennsylvania down to the\r\nCarolinas, were planted so largely by the only considerable Irish\r\nemigrations known to our history, before the great year of famine, 1847,\r\nthe Irish emigrations which followed the wars against the woollen\r\nindustries in the seventeenth century, and the linen industries in the\r\neighteenth. A staunch, doggedly Protestant people, loving the New\r\nEngland Puritans and the Anglicans of Eastern Virginia little better\r\nthan the Maryland Catholics, but contributing more than their full share\r\nof traditional antipathy to that extreme dislike and dread of the Roman\r\nChurch which showed itself half-a-century ago in the burning of\r\nconvents, and thirty years ago gave life and fire to the Know-Nothing\r\nmovement. Even so late as at the time of Father Burke's grand and most\r\nsuccessful mission to America, I remember how much astonished and\r\nimpressed he was by the vigour and the virulence of these feelings. One\r\nof the bishops, he told me, in a great diocese tried (though of course\r\nin vain) to dissuade him on this account from wearing his Dominican\r\ndress. These anti-Catholic passions are much stronger in America to-day\r\nthan it always suits our politicians to remember, though to forget it\r\nmay some day be found very dangerous. Even now two of the ablest\r\nprelates of the most liberal of the Protestant American bodies, Bishop\r\nCleveland Coxe of Western New York, and Bishop Beckwith of Georgia, the\r\nlatter of whom I met the other day in Rome on his return from Palestine,\r\nare promoting what looks very much like a crusade against the plan for\r\nestablishing a Catholic University at Washington. Bishop Cleveland\r\nCoxe's denunciations of what he calls \"the alien Church,\" point straight\r\nto a revival of the \"Native American\" movement; and I fear that\r\nPresident Cleveland's gift of a copy of the Constitution to Leo XIII.\r\nwill hardly make American Catholics forget either the hereditary\r\nanti-Catholic feeling which led him, when Governor of New York, to\r\nimperil the success of the Democratic party by his dogged resistance to\r\nthe Catholic demand for the endowment of Catholic schools and\r\nprotectories, or the scandalous persecution (it can be called by no\r\nother name) of Catholics in Alaska, which was carried on in the name and\r\nunder the patronage of his sister, Miss Cleveland, by a local missionary\r\nof the Presbyterian Church, to the point of the removal by the President\r\nof a Federal judge, who dared to award a Catholic native woman from\r\nVancouver the custody of her own child.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to imagine a greater misfortune for the Church in Ireland,\r\nand for both the Church and the Irish race in America, than the\r\nidentification of the Home Rule movement with the Church, and its\r\ntriumph, after being so identified, and with the help of British\r\nsympathisers and professional politicians, over the resistance of\r\nProtestant Ireland. This dilemma of the Church in Ireland, plainly seen\r\nat Rome, as I know, to-day, was forcibly presented in the speech of\r\nColonel Saunderson.\r\n\r\nThe chair at this Loyalist meeting was filled by the Provost of Trinity,\r\nDr. Jellett, a man of winning and venerable aspect, a kind of \"angelic\r\ndoctor,\" indeed, whose musical and slightly tremulous voice gave a\r\nsingular pathos and interest to his brief but very earnest speech.[11]\r\n\r\nTo-night I dined with the Attorney-General, Mr. O'Brien. Among the\r\ncompany were the Chief-Baron Palles, whose appointment dates back to Mr.\r\nGladstone's Administration of 1873, but who is now an outspoken opponent\r\nof Home Rule; Judge O'Brien, an extremely able man, with the face of an\r\neagle; Mr. Carson, Q.C.; and other notabilities of the bench and bar. My\r\nneighbours at table were a charming and agreeable bencher of the King's\r\nInn, Mr. Atkinson, Q.C., a leader of the Irish bar, and Mr. T.W.\r\nRussell, M.P., who told me some amusing things of one of his colleagues,\r\nan ideal Orangeman, who writes blood-curdling romances in the vein of La\r\nTosca, and goes in fear of the re-establishment of the Holy Office in\r\nDublin and London. In view of the clamours about the severity of the\r\nbench in Ireland, it was edifying to find an Irish Judge astonished by\r\nthe drastic decisions of our Courts in regard to the anarchists who were\r\nhanged at Chicago, after a thorough and protracted review of the law in\r\ntheir cases. He thought no Court in Great Britain or Ireland could have\r\ndealt with them thus stringently, it being understood that the charge of\r\nmurder against them rested on their connection, solely as provocative\r\ninstigators to violence, with the actual throwing of the bombs among the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nSome good stories were told by the lawyers; one of a descendant of the\r\nIrish Kings, a lawyer more remarkable for his mental gifts than for his\r\nphysical graces.\r\n\r\nA peasant looking him carefully over at Cork whispered to a neighbour,\r\n\"And is he really of the ould blood of the Irish kings now, indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I don't wonder the Saxons conquered the Island!\"\r\n\r\nOf the Home Rule movement one of the lawyers said to me, \"The whole\r\nthing is a business operation mainly--a business operation with the\r\npeople who see in it the hope of appeasing their land hunger--and a\r\nbusiness operation for the agitators who live by it. Its main strength,\r\noutside of the priests, who for one reason or another countenance or\r\nfoment it, is in the small country solicitors. The five hundred thousand\r\nodd Irish tenants are the most litigious creatures alive. They are\r\nalways after the local lawyer with half-a-crown to fight this, that, or\r\nthe other question with some neighbour or kinsman, usually a kinsman. So\r\nthe solicitors know the whole country.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the League has chosen a spot in which to work the 'Plan of\r\nCampaign,' the local attorney whips up the tenants to join it. The\r\npoorer tenants are the most easily pushed into the plan, having least to\r\nlose by it. But the lawyer takes the well-to-do tenants in hand, and\r\npromises them that if they yield to the patriotic pressure of the\r\nLeague, and come to grief by so doing, the landlord will at all events\r\nhave to pay the costs of the proceedings. It is this promise which\r\nfinally brings down most of them. To enjoy the luxury of a litigation\r\nwithout paying for it tempts them almost as strongly as the prospect of\r\ngetting the land without paying for it. You will find that the League\r\nalways insists, when things come to a settlement, that the landlord\r\nshall pay the costs. If the landlord through poverty of spirit or of\r\npurse succumbs to this demand, the League scores a victory. If the\r\nlandlord resists, it is a bad job for the League. The local lawyer is\r\ndiscredited in the eyes of his clients, and if he is to get any fees he\r\nmust come down upon his clients for them. Naturally his clients resent\r\nthis. If Mr. Balfour keys up the landlords to stand out manfully against\r\npaying for all the trouble and loss they are continually put to, he will\r\ntake the life of the League so far as Ireland is concerned. As things\r\nnow stand, it is almost the only thriving industry in Ireland!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, Feb. 1._--This morning I called with Lord Ernest Hamilton\r\nupon Sir Bernard Burke, the Ulster King-at-Arms, and the editor or\r\nauthor of many other well-known publications, and especially of the\r\n\"Peerage,\" sometimes irreverently spoken of as the \"British Bible.\"\r\n\r\nSir Bernard's offices are in the picturesque old \"Bermingham\" tower of\r\nthe castle. There we found him wearing his years and his lore as lightly\r\nas a flower, and busy in an ancient chamber, converted by him into a\r\nmost cosy modern study. He received us with the most cordial courtesy,\r\nand was good enough to conduct us personally through his domain.\r\n\r\nMany of the State papers formerly kept here have been removed to the\r\nFour Courts building. But Sir Bernard's tower is still filled with\r\ndocuments of the greatest historical interest, all admirably docketed\r\nand arranged on the system adopted at the Hôtel Soubise, now the Palace\r\nof the Archives in Paris.\r\n\r\nThese documents, like the tower itself, take us back to the early days\r\nwhen Dublin was the stronghold of the Englishry in Ireland, and its\r\ncitizens went in constant peril of an attack from the wild and \"mere\r\nIrish\" in the hills. The masonry of the tower is most interesting. The\r\ncircular stone floors made up of slabs held together without cement,\r\nlike the courses in the towers of Sillustani, by their exact adjustment,\r\nare particularly noteworthy. High up in the tower Sir Bernard showed us\r\na most uncomfortable sort of cupboard fashioned in the huge wall of the\r\ntower, and with a loophole for a window. In this cell the Red Hugh\r\nO'Donnell of Tyrconnel was kept as a prisoner for several years under\r\nElizabeth. He was young and lithe, however, and after his friends had\r\ntried in vain to buy him out, a happy thought one day struck him. He\r\nsqueezed himself through the loophole, and, dropping unhurt to the\r\nground, escaped to the mountains. There for a long time he made head\r\nagainst the English power. In 1597 he drove Sir Conyers Clifford from\r\nbefore the castle of Ballyshannon, with great loss to the English, and\r\nwhen he could no longer keep the field, he sought refuge in Spain. He\r\nwas with the Spanish, as Prince of Tyrconnel, at the crushing defeat of\r\nKinsale in 1601. Escaping again, he died, poisoned, at Simancas the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSir Bernard showed us, among other curious manuscripts, a correspondence\r\nbetween one Higgins, a trained informer, and the Castle authorities in\r\n1798. This correspondence shows that the revolutionary plans of the\r\nNationalists of 1798 were systematically laid before the Government.\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks how very much abler were the leaders of the Irish\r\nrebellion in 1798 than are the present heads of the Irish party in\r\nParliament, how much greater the provocations to rebellion given the\r\nIrish people then were than they are now even alleged to be--how little\r\nthe Irish people in general have now to gain by rebellion, and how much\r\nto lose, it is hard to resist a suspicion that it must be even easier\r\nnow than it was in 1798 for the Government to tap the secrets of the\r\norganisations opposed to it.\r\n\r\nSir Bernard showed us also a curious letter written by Henry Grattan to\r\nthe founder of the great Guinness breweries, which have carried the fame\r\nof Dublin porter into the uttermost parts of the earth. The Guinnesses\r\nare now among the wealthiest people of the kingdom, and Ireland\r\ncertainly owes a great deal to them as \"captains of industry,\" but they\r\nare not Home Rulers.\r\n\r\nAt the Kildare Street Club in the afternoon I talked with two Irish\r\nlandlords from the north of Ireland, who had come up to take their\r\nwomenkind to the Drawing-Room.\r\n\r\nI was struck by their indifference to the political excitements of the\r\nday. One of them had forgotten that the Ripon and Morley reception was\r\nto take place to-night. The other called it \"the love-feast of Voltaire\r\nand the Vatican.\" Both were much more fluent about hunting and farming.\r\nI asked if the hunting still went on in their part of the island.\r\n\r\n\"It has never stopped for a moment,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" added the other, \"nor ever a dog poisoned. They were poisoned,\r\nwhole packs of them, in the papers, but not a dog really. The stories\r\nwere printed just to keep up the agitation, and the farmers winked at it\r\nso as not to be 'bothered.'\"\r\n\r\nBoth averred that they got their rents \"fairly well,\" but both also said\r\nthat they farmed much of their own land. One, a wiry, energetic, elderly\r\nman, of a brisk presence and ruddy complexion, said he constantly went\r\nover to the markets in England. \"I go to Norwich,\" he said, \"not to\r\nLiverpool. Liverpool is only a meat-market, and overdone at that.\r\nNorwich is better for meat and for stores.\" Both agreed this was a great\r\nyear for the potatoes, and said Ireland was actually exporting potatoes\r\nto America. One mentioned a case of two cargoes of potatoes just taken\r\nfrom Dundrum for America, the vessel which took them having brought over\r\nsix hundred tons of hay from America.\r\n\r\nThey were breezy, out-of-door men, both of them. One amused us with a\r\ntale of espying, the other day, two hounds, a collie dog, a terrier, and\r\neighteen cats all amicably running together across a farmyard, with\r\ntheir tails erect, after a dairymaid who was to feed them. The other\r\ncapped this with a story of a pig on his own place, which follows one of\r\nhis farm lads about like a dog,--\"the only pig,\" he said, \"I ever saw\r\nshow any human feeling!\" The gentleman who goes to Norwich thought the\r\nEnglish landlords were in many cases worse off than the Irish. \"Ah, no!\"\r\ninterfered the other, \"not quite; for if the English can't get their\r\nrents, at least they keep their land, but we can neither get our rents\r\nnor keep our land!\" They both admitted that there had been much bad\r\nmanagement of the land in Ireland, and that the agents had done the\r\nowners as well as the tenants a great deal of harm in the past, but they\r\nboth maintained stoutly that the legislation of late years had been\r\none-sided and short-sighted. \"The tenants haven't got real good from\r\nit,\" said one, \"because the claims of the landlord no longer check their\r\nextravagance, and they run more in debt than ever to the shopkeepers and\r\ntraders, who show them little mercy.\" Both also strenuously insisted on\r\nthe gross injustice of leaving the landlords unrelieved of any of the\r\ncharges fixed upon their estates, while their means of meeting those\r\ncharges were cut down by legislation.\r\n\r\n\"You have no landlords in America,\" said one, \"but if you had, how would\r\nyou like to be saddled with heavy tithe charges for a Disestablished\r\nChurch at the same time that your tenants were relieved of their dues\r\nto you?\"\r\n\r\nI explained to him that so far from our having no landlords in America,\r\nthe tenant-farmer class is increasing rapidly in the United States,\r\nwhile it is decreasing in the Old World, while the land laws, especially\r\nin some of our older Western States, give the landlords such absolute\r\ncontrol of their tenants that there is a serious battle brewing at this\r\nmoment in Illinois[12] between a small army of tenants and their\r\nabsentee landlord, an alien and an Irishman, who holds nearly a hundred\r\nthousand acres in the heart of the State, lives in England, and grants\r\nno leases, except on the condition that he shall receive from his\r\ntenants, in addition to the rent, the full amount of all taxes and\r\nlevies whatsoever made upon the lands they occupy.\r\n\r\n\"God bless my soul!\" exclaimed the gentleman who goes to Norwich, \"if\r\nthat is the kind of laws your American Irish will give us with Home\r\nRule, I'll go in for it to-morrow with all my heart!\"\r\n\r\nAfter an early dinner, I set out with Lord Ernest to see the\r\nMorley-Ripon procession. It was a good night for a torchlight\r\nparade--the weather not too chill, and the night dark. The streets were\r\nwell filled, but there was no crowding--no misconduct, and not much\r\nexcitement. The people obviously were out for a holiday, not for a\r\n\"demonstration.\" It was Paris swarming out to the Grand Prix, not Paris\r\non the eve of the barricades; very much such a crowd as one sees in the\r\nstreets and squares of New York on a Fourth of July night, when the city\r\nfathers celebrate that auspicious anniversary with fireworks at the City\r\nHall, and not in the least such a crowd as I saw in the streets of New\r\nYork on the 12th of July 1871, when, thanks to General Shaler and the\r\nredoubtable Colonel \"Jim Fiske,\" a great Orange demonstration led to\r\nsomething very like a massacre by chance medley.\r\n\r\nSmall boys went about making night hideous with tom-toms, extemporised\r\nout of empty fig-drums, and tooting terribly upon tin trumpets. There\r\nwas no general illumination, but here and there houses were bright with\r\ngarlands of lamps, and rockets ever and anon went up from the\r\nhouse-tops.\r\n\r\nWe made our way to the front of a mass of people near one of the great\r\nbridges, over which the procession was to pass on its long march from\r\nKingstown to the house of Mr. Walker, Q.C., in Rutland Square, where the\r\ndistinguished visitors were to meet the liberated Lord Mayor, with Mr.\r\nDwyer Gray, and other local celebrities. A friendly citizen let us perch\r\non his outside car.\r\n\r\nThe procession presently came in sight, and a grand show it made--not of\r\nthe strictly popular and political sort, for it was made up of guilds\r\nand other organised bodies on foot and on horseback, marching in\r\ncompanies--but imposing by reason of its numbers, and of the flaring\r\ntorches. Of these there were not so many as there should have been to do\r\njustice to the procession. The crowd cheered from time to time, with\r\nthat curious Irish cheer which it is often difficult to distinguish from\r\ngroaning, but the only explosive and uproarious greeting given to the\r\nvisitors in our neighbourhood came from a member of \"the devout female\r\nsex,\" a young lady who stood up between two friends on the top of a car\r\nvery near us, and imperilled both her equilibrium and theirs by wildly\r\nwaving her hand-kerchief in the air, and crying out at the top of a\r\nsomewhat husky voice, \"Three cheers for Mecklenburg Street! Three\r\ncheers for Mecklenburg Street!\"\r\n\r\nThis made the crowd very hilarious, but as Lord Ernest's local knowledge\r\ndid not enable him to enlighten me as to the connection between\r\nMecklenburg Street and the liberation of Ireland, I must leave the\r\nmystery of their mirth unsolved till a more convenient season.\r\n\r\nAt Rutland Square the crowd was tightly packed, but perfectly\r\nwell-behaved, and the guests were enthusiastically cheered. But even\r\nbefore they had entered the house of Mr. Walker it began to break up,\r\nand long files of people wended their way to see \"the carriages\"\r\nhastening with their lovely freight to the Castle. Thither Lord Ernest\r\nhas just gone, arrayed in a captivating Court costume of black velvet,\r\nwith cut-steel buttons, sword, and buckles--just the dress in which\r\nWashington used to receive his guests at the White House, and in which\r\nSenator Seward, I remember, insisted in 1860 on getting himself\r\npresented by Mr. Dallas to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSION HOUSE, COUNTY TYRONE, _Feb. 3d._--Hearing nothing from Mr. Davitt\r\nyesterday, I gave up the idea of attending the Ripon-Morley meeting last\r\nnight. As I have come to Ireland to hear what people living in Ireland\r\nhave to say about Irish affairs, I see no particular advantage in\r\nlistening to imported eloquence on the subject, even from so clever a\r\nman as his books prove Mr. Morley to be, and from so conscientious a man\r\nas an acquaintance, going back to the days when he sat with Kingsley at\r\nthe feet of Maurice, makes me believe Lord Ripon to be. How much either\r\nof them knows about Ireland is another matter. A sarcastic Nationalist\r\nacquaintance of mine, with whom I conversed about the visitors\r\nyesterday, assured me it had been arranged that Lord Ripon should wear\r\nthe Star of the Garter, \"so the people might know him from Morley.\" When\r\nI observed that Dublin must have a short memory to forget so soon the\r\nface of a Chief Secretary, he replied: \"Forget his face? Why, they never\r\nsaw his face! It's little enough he was here, and indoors he kept when\r\nhere he was. He shook hands last night with more Irishmen than ever he\r\nspoke to while he was Chief Secretary; for he used to say then, I am\r\ntold, in the Reform Club, that the only way to get along with the Irish\r\nwas to have nothing to do with them!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp discussion, I was told, in the private councils of the\r\nCommittee yesterday as to whether the Queen should be \"boycotted,\" and\r\nthe loyal sentiments usual in connection with her Majesty's name dropped\r\nfrom the proceedings. I believe it was finally settled that this might\r\nput the guests into an awkward position, both of them having worn her\r\nMajesty's uniform of State as public servants of the Crown.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I walked through many of the worst quarters of Dublin. I\r\nmet fewer beggars in proportion than one encounters in such parts of\r\nLondon as South Kensington and other residential regions not\r\nover-frequented by the perambulating policemen; but I was struck by the\r\nnumber of persons--and particularly of women--who wore that most\r\npathetic of all the liveries of distress, \"the look of having seen\r\nbetter days.\" In the most wretched streets I traversed there was more\r\nsqualor than suffering--the dirtiest and most ragged people in them\r\nshowing no signs of starvation, or even of insufficient rations; and\r\ncertainly in the most dismal alleys and by-streets, I came upon nothing\r\nso revolting as the hives of crowded misery which make certain of the\r\ntenement house quarters of New York more gruesome than the Cour des\r\nMiracles itself used to be.\r\n\r\nThis morning at 7.25 A.M. I left Dublin with Lord Ernest Hamilton for\r\nStrabane. My attention was distracted from the reports of the great\r\nmeeting by the varied and picturesque beauty of the landscape, through\r\nwhich we ran at a very respectable rate in a very comfortable carriage.\r\nWe passed Dundalk, where Edward Bruce got himself crowned king of\r\nIreland, after his brother Robert had won a throne in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese masterful Normans, all over Europe from Apulia to Britain, worked\r\nout the problem of \"satisfied nationalities\" much more successfully and\r\nsimply than Napoleon III. in our own day. If Edward Bruce broke down\r\nwhere Robert succeeded, the causes of his failure may perhaps be worth\r\nconsidering even now by people who have set themselves the task in our\r\ntimes of establishing \"an Irish nationality.\" Leaving out the\r\nCromwellian English of Tipperary and the South, and the Scotch who have\r\ndone for Ulster, what he aimed at for all Ireland, they have very much\r\nthe same materials to deal with as those which he dismally failed to\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nDrogheda stands beautifully in a deep valley through which flows the\r\nBoyne Water, spanned by one of the finest viaducts in Europe. Here, two\r\nyears after the discovery of America, Poyning's Parliament enacted that\r\nall laws passed in Ireland must be subject to approval by the English\r\nPrivy Council. I wonder nobody has proposed a modification of this form\r\nof Home Rule for Ireland now. Earl Grey's recent suggestion that\r\nParliamentary government be suspended for ten years in Ireland, which I\r\nheard warmly applauded by some able lawyers and business men in Dublin,\r\ninvolves like this an elimination of the Westminster debates from the\r\nproblem of government in Ireland. As we passed Drogheda, Father Burke's\r\nmagnificent presence and thrilling voice came back to me out of the\r\nmist of years, describing with an indignant pathos, never to be\r\nforgotten, the fearful scenes which followed the surrender of Sir Arthur\r\nAshton's garrison, when \"for the glory of God,\" and \"to prevent the\r\nfurther effusion of blood,\" Oliver ordered all the officers to be\r\nknocked on the head, and every tenth man of the soldiers killed, and the\r\nrest shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes. But how different was the\r\nspirit in which the great Dominican recalled these events from that in\r\nwhich the \"popular orators,\" scattering firebrands and death, delight to\r\ndwell upon them!\r\n\r\nAt Strabane station we found a handsome outside car waiting on us, and\r\ndrove off briskly for this charming place, the home of one of the most\r\nactive and prosperous manufacturers in Ireland. A little more than half\r\nway between the station and Sion House, Mr. Herdman met us afoot. We\r\njumped off and walked up with him. Sion House, built for him by his\r\nbrother, an accomplished architect, is a handsome Queen Anne mansion. It\r\nstands on a fine knoll, commanding lovely views on all sides. Below it,\r\nand beyond a little stream, rise the extensive flax-mills which are the\r\nlife of the place, under the eye and within touch of the hand of the\r\nmaster. These works were established here by Mr. Herdman's father, after\r\nhe had made a vain attempt to establish them at Ballyshannon in Donegal,\r\nhalf a century ago. As all salmon fishers know, the water-power is\r\nadmirable at Ballyshannon, where the Erne pours in torrents down a\r\nthirty feet fall. But the ignorance and indolence of the people made\r\nBallyshannon quite impossible, with this result, that while the Erne\r\nstill flows unvexed to the sea, and the people of Ballyshannon live very\r\nmuch as they lived in 1835, here at Sion the Mourne enables 1100 Irish\r\noperatives to work up £90,000 worth of Irish flax every year into yarn\r\nfor the Continent, and to divide among themselves some £20,000 a year in\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon we walked with Mr. Herdman through the mills and the\r\nmodel village which has grown up around them. Everywhere we found order,\r\nneatness, and thrift. The operatives are almost all people of the\r\ncountry, Catholics and Protestants in almost equal numbers. \"I find it\r\nwise,\" said Mr. Herdman, \"to give neither religion a preponderance, and\r\nto hold my people of both religions to a common standard of fidelity and\r\nefficiency.\" The greatest difficulty he has had to contend with is the\r\nineradicable objection of some of the peasantry to continuous industry.\r\nHe told us of a strapping lass of eighteen who came to the mills, but\r\nvery soon gave up and went back to the parental shebeen in the mountains\r\nrather than get up early in the morning to earn fourteen shillings a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThree weeks of her work would have paid the year's rent of the paternal\r\nholding.\r\n\r\nIn the village, which is regularly laid out, is a reading-room for the\r\nworkpeople. There are cricket clubs, and one of the mill buildings (just\r\nnow crammed with bales of flax) has been fitted up by Mr. Herdman as a\r\ntheatre. There is a drop-curtain representing the Lake of Como, and the\r\nflies are flanked by life-size copies in plaster of the Apollo Belvidere\r\nand the Medicean Venus. This is a development I had hardly looked to see\r\nin Ulster.\r\n\r\nAfter we had gone over the works thoroughly, Mr. Herdman took us back,\r\non a transparent pretext of enlightened curiosity touching certain\r\nqualities of spun flax, to give us a glimpse of the \"beauty of Sion\"--a\r\nwell-grown graceful girl of fifteen or sixteen summers. She\r\nconcentrated her attention, as soon as we appeared, upon certain\r\nmysterious bobbins and spindles, with an exaggerated determination which\r\nproved how completely she saw through our futile and frivolous devices.\r\nMr. Herdman told us, as we came away discomfited, a droll story of the\r\nugliest girl ever employed here--a girl so preternaturally ugly that one\r\nof his best blacksmiths having been entrapped into offering to marry\r\nher, lost heart of grace on the eve of the sacrifice, and, taking ship\r\nat Derry for America, fled from Sion for ever.\r\n\r\nIn the evening came, with other guests, Dr. Webb, Q.C., Regius Professor\r\nof Laws and Public Orator of Trinity at Dublin, well known both as a\r\nGrecian capable of composing \"skits\" as clever as the verses yclept\r\nHomerstotle--in which the _Saturday Review_ served up the Donnelly\r\nnonsense about Bacon and Shakespeare--and as a translator of _Faust_. He\r\nwas abused by the Loyalists at Dublin, in 1884, for his defence of P.N.\r\nFitzgerald, the leader who beat Parnell and Archbishop Croke so badly at\r\nThurles the other day; and he is in a fair way now to be denounced with\r\nequal fervour by the Nationalists as a County Court judge in Donegal.\r\nHe finds this post no sinecure. \"I do as much work in five days,\" he\r\nsaid to-night, \"as the Superior Judges do in five weeks.\"\r\n\r\nHe is a staunch Unionist, and laughs at the notion that the Irish people\r\ncare one straw for a Parliament in Dublin. \"Why should they?\" he said.\r\n\"What did any Parliament in Dublin ever do to gratify the one real\r\npassion of the Irish peasant--his hunger for a bit of land? So far as\r\nthe Irish people are concerned, Home Rule means simply agrarian reform.\r\nWould they get that from a Parliament in Dublin? If the British\r\nParliament evicts the landlords and makes the tenants lords of the land,\r\nthey will be face to face with Davitt's demand for the nationalising of\r\nthe land. Do you suppose they will like to see the lawyers and the\r\npoliticians organising a labour agitation against the 'strong farmers'?\r\nThe last thing they want is a Parliament in Dublin. Lord Ashbourne's Act\r\ncarries in its principle the death-warrant of the 'National League.'\"\r\n\r\nSome excellent stories were told in the picturesque smoking-room after\r\ndinner, one of a clever and humorous, sensible and non-political priest,\r\nwho, being taken to task by some of his brethren for giving the cold\r\nshoulder to the Nationalist movement, excused himself by saying, \"I\r\nshould like to be a patriot; but I can't be. It's all along of the\r\nrheumatism which prevents me from lying out at nights in a ditch with a\r\nrifle.\" The same priest being reproached by others of the cloth with a\r\nfondness for the company of some of the resident landlords in his\r\nneighbourhood, replied, \"It's in the blood, you see. My poor mother, God\r\nrest her soul! she always had a liking for the quality. As for my dear\r\nfather, he was just a blundering peasant like the rest of ye!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGWEEDORE, _Saturday, 4th Feb._--A good day's work to-day!\r\n\r\nWe left our hospitable friends at Sion House early in the morning. The\r\nsun was shining brightly; the air so soft and bland that the thrushes\r\nwere singing like mad creatures in the trees and the shrubbery; and the\r\nsky was more blue than Italy. \"A foine day it is, sorr,\" said our jarvey\r\nas we took our seats on the car. There is some point in the old Irish\r\nsarcasm that English travellers in Ireland only see one side of the\r\ncountry, because they travel through it on the outside car. But to make\r\nthis point tell, four people must travel on the car. In that case they\r\nmust sit two on a side, each pair facing one side only of the landscape.\r\nIt is a very different business when you travel on an outside car alone,\r\nwith the driver sitting on one side of it, or with one companion only,\r\nwhen the driver occupies the little perch in front between the sides of\r\nthe car. When you travel thus, the outside car is the best thing in the\r\nworld, after a good roadster, for taking you rapidly over a country, and\r\nenabling you to command all points of the horizon. Double up one leg on\r\nthe seat, let the other dangle freely, using the step as a stirrup, and\r\nyou go rattling along almost as if you were on horseback.\r\n\r\nWe drove through a long suburb of Strabane into the busiest quarter of\r\nthe busy little place. The names on the shops were predominantly\r\nScotch--Maxwells, Stewarts, Hamiltons, Elliotts. I saw but one Celtic\r\nname, M'Ilhenny, and one German, Straub. I changed gold for enormous\r\nBank of Ireland notes at a neat local bank, and the cheery landlord of\r\nthe Abercorn Arms gave us a fresh car to take us on to Letterkenny, a\r\ndrive of some twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThe car came up like a small blizzard, flying about at the heels of an\r\nuncanny little grey mare. Lord Ernest knew the beast well, and said she\r\nwas twenty-five years old. She behaved like an unbroken filly at first,\r\nbut soon striking her pace, turned out a capital goer, and took us on\r\nwithout turning a hair till her work was done. The weather continued to\r\nbe good, but clouds rolled up around the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"It'll always be bad weather,\" said our saturnine jarvey, \"when the\r\nJudges come to hold court, and never be good again till they rise.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a consequence of alien rule in Ireland, never, so far as I know,\r\nbrought to the notice of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Why is this?\" I asked; \"is it because of the time of the year they\r\nselect?\"\r\n\r\n\"The time of year, sorr?\" he replied, glancing compassionately at me.\r\n\"No, not at all; it's because of the oaths!\"\r\n\r\nWe reached Letterkenny in time for a very good luncheon at \"Hegarty's,\"\r\none of the neatest little inns I have ever found in a place of the size.\r\nIt stands on the long main street which is really the town. At one end\r\nof this street is a very pretty row of picturesque ivy-clad brick\r\ncottages, built by a landlord whose property and handsome park bound\r\nthe town on the west; and the street winds alongside the slope of a hill\r\nrising from the bank of the Swilly river. A fair was going on. The\r\nlittle market-place was alive with bustling, chattering, and chaffering\r\ncountry-folk. Smartly-dressed young damsels tripped in and out of the\r\nneat well-filled shops, and in front of a row of semidetached villas,\r\nlike a suburban London terrace, on the hill opposite \"Hegarty's,\" a\r\nGerman band smote the air with discordant fury. Decidedly a lively,\r\nprosperous little town is Letterkenny, nor was I surprised to learn from\r\na communicative gentleman, nursing his cane near the inn-door, that\r\nadvantage would be taken of the presence of the Hussars sent to keep\r\norder at Dunfanaghy, to \"give a ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought all the country was in arms about the trials at\r\nDunfanaghy,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"In arms about the trials at Dunfanaghy? Oh no; they'll never be locked\r\nup, Father M'Fadden and Mr. Blane. And the people here at Letterkenny,\r\nthey've more sinse than at Dunfanaghy. Have you heard of the champagne?\"\r\n\r\nUpon this he proceeded to tell me, as a grand joke, that Father\r\nM'Fadden and Mr. Blane, M.P., having declined to accept the tea offered\r\nthem by the authorities during their detention, they had been permitted\r\nto order what they liked from the local hotel-keeper. After the trial\r\nwas over, and they were released on bail to prosecute their appeal, the\r\nhotel-keeper demanded of the authorities payment of his bill, including\r\ntwo bottles of champagne ordered to refresh the member for Armagh!\r\n\r\nA conspicuous, smart, spick-and-span house on the main street, built of\r\nbrick and wood, with a verandah, and picked out in bright colours, was\r\npointed out to me by this amiable citizen as the residence of a\r\n\"returned American.\" This was a man, he said, who had made some money in\r\nAmerica, but got tired of living there, and had come back to end his\r\ndays in his native place He was a good man, my informant added, \"only he\r\nputs on too many airs.\"\r\n\r\nA remarkably handsome, rosy-faced young groom, a model of manhood in\r\nvigour and grace, presently brought us up a wagonette with a pair of\r\nstout nags, and a driver in a suit of dark-brown frieze, whose head\r\nseemed to have been driven down between his shoulders. He never lifted\r\nit up all the way to Gweedore, but he proved to be a capital jarvey\r\nnotwithstanding, and knew the country as well as his horses.\r\n\r\nNot long after leaving the town by a road which passes the huge County\r\nAsylum (now literally crammed, I am told, with lunatics), we passed a\r\nruined church on the banks of a stream. Here the country people, it\r\nseems, halt and wash their feet before entering Letterkenny, failing\r\nwhich ceremony they may expect a quarrel with somebody before they get\r\nback to their homes. This wholesome superstition doubtless was\r\nestablished ages ago by some good priest, when priests thought it their\r\nduty to be the preachers and makers of peace.\r\n\r\nWe soon left the wooded country of the Swilly and began to climb into\r\nthe grand and melancholy Highlands of Donegal. The road was as fine as\r\nany in the Scottish Highlands, and despite the keen chill wind, the\r\nglorious and ever-changing panoramas of mountain and strath through\r\nwhich we drove were a constant delight, until, just as we came within\r\nfull range of Muckish, the giant of Donegal, the weather finally broke\r\ndown into driving mists and blinding rain.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up near a picturesque little shebeen, to water the horses and\r\nget our Highland wraps well about us. Out came a hardy, cheery old\r\nfarmer. He swept the heavens with the eye of a mountaineer, and\r\nexclaimed:--\"Ah! it's a coorse day intirely, it is.\" \"A coorse day\r\nintirely\" from that moment it continued to be.\r\n\r\nHappily the curtain had not fallen before we caught a grand passing\r\nglimpse of the romantic gorge of Glen Veagh, closed and commanded in the\r\nshadowy distance by the modern castle of Glenveagh, the mountain home of\r\nmy charming country-woman, Mrs. Adair.\r\n\r\nThanks to its irregular serpentine outline, and to the desolate majesty\r\nof the hills which environ it, Lough Veagh, though not a large sheet of\r\nwater, may well be what it is reputed to be, a rival of the finest lochs\r\nin Scotland. No traces are now discernible on its shores of the too\r\ncelebrated evictions of Glen Veagh. But from the wild and rugged aspect\r\nof the surrounding country it is probable enough that these evictions\r\nwere to the evicted a blessing in disguise, and that their descendants\r\nare now enjoying, beyond the Atlantic, a measure of prosperity and of\r\nhappiness which neither their own labour nor the most liberal\r\nlegislation could ever have won for them here. We caught sight, as we\r\ndrove through Mrs. Adair's wide and rocky domain, of wire fences, and I\r\nbelieve it is her intention to create here a small deer forest. This\r\nought to be as good a stalking country as the Scottish Highlands,\r\nprovided the people can be got to like \"stalking\" stags better than\r\nlandlords and agents.\r\n\r\nLong before we reached Glen Veagh we had bidden farewell, not only to\r\nthe hedges and walls of Tyrone and Eastern Donegal, but to the\r\n\"ditches,\" which anywhere but in Ireland would be called \"embankments,\"\r\nand entered upon great stone-strewn wastes of land seemingly unreclaimed\r\nand irreclaimable. Huge boulders lay tossed and tumbled about as if they\r\nhad been whirled through the air by the cyclones of some prehistoric\r\nage, and dropped at random when the wild winds wearied of the fun. The\r\nlast landmark we made out through the gathering storm was the pinnacled\r\ncrest of Errigal. Of Dunlewy, esteemed the loveliest of the Donegal\r\nlakes, we could see little or nothing as we hurried along the highway,\r\nwhich follows its course down to the Clady, the river of Gweedore; and\r\nwe blessed the memory of Lord George Hill when suddenly turning from\r\nthe wind and the rain into what seemed to be a mediaeval courtyard\r\nflanked by trees, we pulled up in the bright warm light of an open\r\ndoorway, shook ourselves like Newfoundland dogs, and were welcomed by a\r\nfrank, good-looking Scottish host to a glowing peat fire in this really\r\ncomfortable little hotel, the central pivot of a most interesting\r\nexperiment in civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGWEEDORE, _Sunday, Feb. 5th._--A morning as soft and bright almost as\r\nApril succeeded the stormy night. Errigal lifted his bold irregular\r\noutlines royally against an azure sky. The sunshine glinted merrily on\r\nthe swift waters of the Clady, which flows almost beneath our windows\r\nfrom Dunlewy Lough to the sea. The birds were singing in the trees,\r\nwhich all about our hotel make what in the West would be called an\r\n\"opening\" in the wide and woodless expanse of hill and bog.\r\n\r\nThis hotel was for many years the home of Lord George Hill, who built it\r\nin the hope of making Gweedore, what in England or Scotland it would\r\nlong ago have become, a prosperous watering-place. Now that a\r\nbattle-royal is going on between Lord George's son and heir and the\r\ntenants on the estate, organised by Father M'Fadden under the \"Plan of\r\nCampaign,\" it is important to know something of the history of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIs this a case of the sons of the soil expropriated by an alien and\r\nconfiscating Government to enrich a ruthless invader? I was told by a\r\nNationalist acquaintance in Dublin that the owner of Gweedore is a near\r\nkinsman of the Marquis of Londonderry, and that the property came to him\r\nby inheritance under an ancient confiscation of the estates of the\r\nO'Dounels of Tyrconnel. All of this I find is embroidery.\r\n\r\nThe \"Carlisle\" room, which our landlord has assigned to us, contains a\r\nnumber of books, the property of the late Lord George, and ample\r\nmaterials are here for making out the annals of Gweedore. Lord George,\r\nit seems, was a posthumous son of the fourth Marquis of Downshire, and a\r\nnephew of that Marchioness of Salisbury who was burned to death with the\r\nwest wing of Hatfield House half a century ago. He inherited nothing in\r\nDonegal, nor was any provision made for him under his father's will. His\r\nelder brothers made up and settled upon him a sum of twenty thousand\r\npounds. He entered the Army, and being quartered for a time at\r\nLetterkenny, shot and fished all about Donegal. He found the people here\r\nkindly and friendly, but in a deplorable state of ignorance and of\r\ndestitution. Their holdings under sundry small proprietors were entirely\r\nunimproved, and as their families increased, these holdings were cut up\r\nby themselves into even smaller strips under the system known as\r\n\"rundale,\"--each son as he grew up taking off a slice of the paternal\r\nholding, putting up a hut with mud, and scratching the soil after his\r\nown rude fashion. This custom, necessarily fatal to civilisation,\r\ndoubtless came down from the traditional times when the lands of a sept\r\nwere held in common by the sept, before the native chieftains had\r\nconverted themselves into landlords, and defeated Sir John Davies's\r\nattempt to convert their tribal kinsmen into peasant proprietors.\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin, it had reduced Gweedore, or \"Tullaghobegly,\" fifty\r\nyears ago to barbarism. Nearly nine thousand people then dwelt here with\r\nnever a landlord among them. There was no \"Coercion\" in Gweedore,\r\nneither was there a coach nor a car to be found in the whole district.\r\nThe nominal owners of the small properties into which the district was\r\ndivided knew little and cared less about them. The rents were usually\r\n\"made by the tenants,\"--a step in advance, it will be seen, of the\r\nsystem which the collective wisdom of Great Britain has for the last\r\ntwenty years been trying to establish in Ireland. But they were only\r\npaid when it was convenient. An agent of one of these properties who\r\ntravelled fourteen miles one day to collect some rents gave it up and\r\ndrove back again, because the \"day was too bad\" for him to wander about\r\nin the mountains on the chance of finding the tenants at home and\r\ndisposed to give him a trifle on account. On most of the properties\r\nthere were arrears of eight, ten, and twenty years' standing.\r\n\r\nThere was one priest in the district, and one National School, the\r\nschoolmaster, with a family of nine persons, receiving the munificent\r\nstipend of eight pounds a year. These nine thousand people, depending\r\nabsolutely upon tillage and pasture, owned among them all one cart and\r\none plough, eight saddles, two pillions, eleven bridles, and thirty-two\r\nrakes! They had no means of harrowing their lands but with meadow rakes,\r\nand the farms were so small that from four to ten farms could be\r\nharrowed in a day with one rake.\r\n\r\nTheir beds were of straw, mountain grass, or green and dried rushes.\r\nAmong the nine thousand people there were but two feather-beds, and but\r\neight beds stuffed with chaff. There were but two stables and six\r\ncow-houses in the whole district. None of the women owned more than one\r\nshift, nor was there a single bonnet among them all, nor a looking-glass\r\ncosting more than threepence.\r\n\r\nThe climate and the scenery took the fancy of Lord George. He made up\r\nhis mind to see what could be done with this forgotten corner of the\r\nworld, and to that end bought up as he could the small and scattered\r\nproperties, till he had invested the greater part of his small fortune,\r\nand acquired about twenty thousand acres of land. Of this, little was\r\nfit for cultivation, even with the help of capital and civilised\r\nmanagement. There was not a road in the district, nor a drain.\r\n\r\nLord George came and established himself here. He went to work\r\nsystematically to improve the country, reclaiming bog-lands, building\r\nroads, and laying out the property into regular farms. He went about\r\namong the people himself, trying to get their confidence, and to let\r\nthem know what he wanted to do for them, and with their help.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they wouldn't believe him to be a lord at all, \"because\r\nhe spoke Irish\"; and the breaking up of the rundale system, under which\r\nthey had lived in higgledy-piggledy laziness, exasperated them greatly.\r\nOf the first man who took a fenced and well-defined farm from Lord\r\nGeorge, and went to work on it, the others observed that he would come\r\nto no good by it, because he would \"have to keep a maid just to talk to\r\nhis wife.\" Men could not be got for any wages to work at draining, or at\r\nmaking the \"ditches\" or embankments to delineate the new holdings; and\r\nwhen Lord George found adventurous \"tramps\" willing to earn a few\r\nshillings by honest work of the kind, conspiracies were formed to undo\r\nby night what was done by day. However, Lord George persevered.\r\n\r\nThere was not a shop, nor a dispensary, nor a doctor, nor a warehouse,\r\nnor a quay for landing goods in this whole populous and sea-washed\r\nregion. He put up storehouses, built a little harbour at Bunbeg,\r\nestablished a dispensary, got a doctor to settle in the district, and\r\nfinally put up the hotel in which we are. He advanced money to tenants\r\ndisposed to improve their holdings. Finding the women, as usual, more\r\nthrifty and industrious than the men, and gifted with a natural aptitude\r\nfor the loom and the spindle, he introduced the weaving of woollen yarn\r\ninto stout frieze stuffs and foot-gear for both sexes. This was in 1840,\r\nand in 1854 Gweedore hand-knit socks and stockings were sold to the\r\namount of £500, being just about the annual estimated rents of all the\r\nproperties bought by Lord George at the time when he bought them in\r\n1838! But with this difference: The owners from whom Lord George bought\r\nthe properties got their £500 very irregularly, when they got it at all;\r\nwhereas the wives and daughters of the tenants, who made the socks and\r\nstockings, were paid their £500 in cash.\r\n\r\nClearly in Gweedore I have a case not of the children of the soil\r\ndespoiled and trampled upon by the stranger, but of the honest\r\ninvestment of alien capital in Irish land, and of the administration by\r\nthe proprietor himself of the Irish property so acquired for the benefit\r\nalike of the owner and of the occupiers of the land.\r\n\r\nThat the deplorable state in which he found the people was mainly due to\r\ntheir own improvidence and gregarious incapacity is also tolerably\r\nclear. On the west coast of Norway, dear to the heart of the\r\nsalmon-fisher, you find people living under conditions certainly no more\r\nfavourable than here exist. North of the Hardanger Fjord, the spring\r\nopens only in June. The farmers grow only oats and barley; but they have\r\nno market except for the barley, and live chiefly by the pasturage. It\r\nis as rocky a region as Donegal. But the Norsemen never try to make the\r\nland do more than it is capable of doing. With them the oldest son takes\r\nthe farm and works it. The juniors are welcome to work on the farm if\r\nthey like for their brother, but they are not allowed to cut it up.\r\nThere is no rundale in Norway; and when the cadets see that there is no\r\nroom for them they quietly \"pull up stakes,\" and go forth to seek a new\r\nhome, no matter where.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen years Lord George Hill spent on Gweedore all the rents he\r\nreceived from it, and a great deal more. During that time the relations\r\nbetween the people and their new landlord seem to have been, in the\r\nmain, most friendly, notwithstanding his constant efforts to break up\r\ntheir old habits, or, to use their own language, to \"bother them.\" But\r\nthere were no \"evictions\"; rents were not raised even where the tenants\r\nwere visibly able to pay better rents; prizes were given annually for\r\nthe best and neatest cottages, for the best crops of turnips (neither\r\nturnips, parsnips, nor carrots were there at Gweedore when Lord George\r\nbought the estate), for the best pigs (there was not a pig in Gweedore\r\nin 1838!), for calves and colts, for the best fences, the best ordered\r\ntillage farms, the best labourers' cottages, the best beds and bedding,\r\nthe best butter, the best woollen goods made on the estate. The old\r\nrundale plan of dividing up the land among the children was put a stop\r\nto, and every tenant was encouraged not to make his holding smaller, but\r\nto add to and enlarge it. A corn-mill, saw-mill, and flax-mill were\r\nestablished. In 1838 there was not a baker within ten miles. In 1852 the\r\nlocal baker was driving a good business in good bread. The tenant's\r\nwife, for whom in 1838 a single shift was a social superiority, in 1852\r\nwent shopping at Bunbeg for the latest fashions from Derry or Dublin.\r\n\r\nWhatever \"landlordism\" may mean elsewhere in Ireland, it is plain enough\r\nthat in the history of Gweedore it has meant the difference between\r\nsavage squalor and civilisation.\r\n\r\nLord George Hill died in 1879, the year in which the Land League began\r\nits operations. He bequeathed this property to his son, Captain Hill, by\r\nwhom the management of it has been left to agents. After Lord George's\r\ndeath two tracts of mountain pasture, reserved by him to feed imported\r\nsheep, were let to the tenants, who by that time had come to own quite a\r\nconsiderable number, some thousands, of live stock, cattle, horses, and\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with this concession to the tenants the provisions made by\r\nLord George against the subdivision of holdings began to give way.\r\nFather M'Fadden, combining the position of President of the National\r\nLeague with that of parish priest, seems to have favoured this tendency,\r\nand to have encouraged the putting up of new houses on reduced holdings\r\nto accommodate an increasing population. A flood which in August 1880\r\ndamaged the chapel and caused the death of five persons gave him an\r\nopportunity of bringing before the British public the condition of the\r\npeople in a letter to the London _Times_, which elicited a very generous\r\nresponse, several hundred pounds, it is said, having been sent to him\r\nfrom London alone. Large contributions of relief were also made to\r\nGweedore from the Duchess of Marlborough's Fund, and Gweedore became a\r\nstanding butt of British benevolence. Two results seem to have followed,\r\nnaturally enough,--a growing indisposition on the part of the tenants to\r\npay rent, and a rapid rise in the value of tenant rights. With the\r\nNational League standing between them and the landlord, with the British\r\nParliament legislating year after year in favour of the Irish tenant and\r\nagainst the Irish landlord, and with the philanthropic public ready to\r\nrespond to any appeal for help made on their behalf, the tenants at\r\nGweedore naturally became a privileged class. In no other way at least\r\ncan I explain the extraordinary fact that tenant rights at Gweedore have\r\nbeen sold, according to Lord Cowper's Blue-book of 1886, during the\r\nperiod of the greatest alleged distress and congestion in this district,\r\nat prices representing from forty to a hundred-and-thirty years'\r\npurchase of the landlord's rent!\r\n\r\nIn this Blue-book the Rev. Father M'Fadden appears as receiving no less\r\nthan £115 sterling for the tenant-right sold by him of ground, the head\r\nrent of which is £1, 2s. 6d. a year. The worst enemy of Father M'Fadden\r\nwill hardly suspect him, I hope, of taking such a sum as this from a\r\ntenant farmer for the right to starve to death by inches.[13]\r\n\r\nA shrewd Galway man, now here, who seems to know the region well, and\r\nlikes both the scenery and the people, tells me that the troubles which\r\nhave now culminated in the arrest of Father M'Fadden have been\r\naggravated by the vacillation of Captain Hill, and by the foibles of his\r\nagent, Colonel Dopping, who not long ago brought down Mr. Gladstone with\r\nhis unloaded rifle. That the tenants as a body have been, or now are,\r\nunable to pay their rent he does not believe. On the contrary, he thinks\r\nthem, as a body, rather well off. Certainly I have seen and spoken with\r\nnone of them about the roads to-day who were not hearty-looking men, and\r\nin very good case. Colonel Dopping, according to my Galwegian, is not an\r\nEnglishman, but a Longford Irishman of good family, who got his\r\ntraining in India as an official of the Woods and Forests in Bengal. \"He\r\nis not a bad-hearted man, nor unkind,\" said my Galwegian, \"but he is\r\ntoo much of a Bengal tiger in his manner. He went into the cottages\r\npersonally and lectured the people, and that they never will stand. They\r\ndon't require or expect you to believe what they say--in fact they have\r\nlittle respect for you if you do--but they like to have the agent\r\npretend that he believes them, and then go on and show that he don't.\r\nBut he must never lose his temper about it. Colonel Dopping, I have\r\nheard, argued with an old woman one day who was telling him more yarns\r\nthan were ever spun into cloth in Gweedore, till she picked up her cup\r\nof tea and threw it in his face. He flounced out of the cottage, and\r\nordered the police to arrest her. That did him more harm than if he had\r\nshot a dozen boys.\" \"What with the temper of Colonel Dopping and the\r\nvacillation of Captain Hill, who is always of the mind of the last man\r\nthat speaks to him, Father M'Fadden has had it all his own way. Captain\r\nHill's claim was for £1800 of arrears, long arrears too, and £400 of\r\ncosts. How much the people paid in under the Plan of Campaign nobody\r\nknows but Father M'Fadden. But he is a clever _padre_, and he played\r\nCaptain Hill till he finally gave up the costs, and settled for £1450.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this sum represents what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It represents in round numbers about two years' income from an estate\r\nin which Captain Hill's father must have invested, first and last, more\r\nnearly £40,000 than £20,000 of money that never came out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound like a very good operation. But isn't the question,\r\nWhether the tenants have earned this sum, such as it is, out of the land\r\nlet to them by Captain Hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly, I think. You must remember there are some twelve\r\nhundred families living here on land bought with Lord George's money,\r\nand enjoying all the advantages which the place owes to his investment\r\nand his management, much more than to any labour or skill of theirs. You\r\nmust look at their rents as accommodation rents. Suppose they earn the\r\nrent in Scotland, or England, or Tyrone, or wherever you like, the\r\nquestion is, What do they get for it from Captain Hill? They get a\r\nholding with land enough to grow potatoes on, and with as much free fuel\r\nas ever they like, and with free pasture for their beasts, and all this\r\nthey get on the average, mind you, for no more than ten shillings a\r\nyear! Why, there was a time, I can assure you, when the women here\r\nearned the value of all the Hill rents by knitting stockings and making\r\nwoollen stuffs. You see the stuffs lying here in this window that they\r\nmake even now, and good stuffs too. But before the League boycotted the\r\nagency here, the agency ten years ago used to pay out £900 in a year,\r\nwhere it pays less than £100 to the women for their work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did the League do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why, because it wanted to control the work itself, and to know\r\njust what it brings into the place. You must remember Father M'Fadden is\r\nthe President of the League, and the people will do anything for him. I\r\nhave heard of one old woman who sat up of nights last year knitting\r\nsocks to send up to London, to pay the Christmas dues to the\r\nFather,--six shillings' worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are these stuffs here in the hotel made for the agency you speak\r\nof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no; these are just made by women that know the hotel, and Mr.\r\nRobinson here, he kindly takes in the stuffs. You see the name of every\r\nwoman on every one of them that made it, and the price. If a stranger\r\nbuys some, he pays the money to Mr. Robinson, and so it goes to the\r\nwomen, and no commission charged.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"stuffs\" are certainly excellent, very evenly woven; and the\r\npatterns, all devised, I am told, by the women themselves, very simple\r\nand tasteful. The only dyes used are got by the women also from the\r\nsea-weeds and the kelp, which must be counted among the resources of the\r\nplace. The browns and ochres thus produced are both soft and vivid;\r\nwhile nothing can be better than a peculiar warm grey, produced by a\r\nskilful mingling of the undyed wools.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, causes the distress for which the name of Gweedore is a\r\nsynonym?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't exist,\" responded my Galwegian; \"that is, there is no such\r\ndistress in Gweedore as you find in Connemara, for instance;[14] but\r\nwhat distress there is in Gweedore is due much more to the habits the\r\npeople have been getting into of late years, and to the idleness of\r\nthem, than to any pressure of the rents you hear about, or even to the\r\npoverty of the soil. Go down to the store at Bunbeg, and see what they\r\nbuy and go in debt for! You won't find in any such place as Bunbeg in\r\nEngland such things. And even this don't measure it; for, you see,\r\ntwo-thirds of them are not free to deal at Bunbeg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Is Bunbeg 'boycotted'?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all. But they are on the books of the 'Gombeen man'--Sweeney\r\nof Dungloe and Burtonport. They're always in debt to him for the meal;\r\nand then he backs the travelling tea-pedlars, and the bakers that carry\r\naround cakes, and all these run up the accounts all the time. Tot up\r\nwhat these people lay out for tea at four shillings a pound--and they\r\nwon't have cheap tea--and what they pay for meal, and what they pay for\r\ninterest, and the 'testimonials,'--they paid for the monument here to\r\nO'Donnell, the Donegal man that murdered Carey,--and the dues to the\r\npriest, and you'll find the £700 or so they don't pay the landlord going\r\nin other directions three and four times over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they are falling back into all the old laziness, the men\r\nsauntering about, or sitting and smoking, while the women do all the\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid having told us Mass would be performed at noon, I walked with\r\nLord Ernest a mile or so up the road to Derrybeg, to see the people\r\nthronging down from the hills; the women in their picturesque fashion\r\nwearing their bright shawls drawn over their heads. But the maid had\r\ndeceived us. The Mass was fixed for eleven, and I suspect her of being a\r\nProtestant in disguise.\r\n\r\nOn the way back we met Mr. Burke, the resident magistrate. He has a neat\r\nhouse here, with a garden, and had come over from Dunfanaghy to see his\r\nwife. He meant to return before dark. The country was quiet enough, he\r\nsaid; but there were some troublesome fellows about, keeping up the\r\nexcitement over the arrest at Father M'Fadden's trial of Father\r\nStephens--a young priest recently from Liverpool, who has become the\r\ncurate of quite another Father M'Fadden--the parish priest of\r\nFalcarragh, and is giving his local superior a great deal of trouble by\r\nhis activity in connection with the \"Plan of Campaign.\" Mr. Wybrants\r\nOlphert of Ballyconnell, the chief landlord of Falcarragh, has been\r\n\"boycotted,\" on suspicion of promoting the arrest of the two priests.\r\nFive policemen have been put into his house. At Falcarragh, where six\r\npolicemen are usually stationed, there are now forty. Mr. Burke\r\nevidently thinks, though he did not say so, that Father Stephens has\r\nbeen spoiled of his sleep by the laurels of Father M'Fadden of Gweedore.\r\nHe is to be tried at Dunfanaghy on Tuesday, and there are now 150 troops\r\nquartered there--Rifles and Hussars.\r\n\r\n\"Are they not boycotted?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. The people rather enjoy the bustle and the show, not to speak of\r\nthe money the soldiers spend.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ernest, who knows Mr. Olphert, sent him over a message by Mr. Burke\r\nthat we would drive over to-morrow, and pay our respects to him at\r\nBallyconnell. From this Mr. Burke tried to dissuade us, but what he told\r\nus naturally increased our wish to go.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon I ordered a car, and drove to Derrybeg, to call there on\r\nFather M'Fadden, Lord Ernest, who has already seen him, agreeing to call\r\nthere for me on his return from a walk. We passed much reclaimed\r\nbogland, mostly now in grass, and looking fairly well; many piles of\r\nturf and clusters of cottages, well-built, but not very neatly kept.\r\nFrom each, as we passed, the inevitable cur rushed out and barked\r\nhimself hoarse. Then came a waste of bog and boulders, and then a long,\r\nneat stone wall, well coped with unhewn stone, which announced the\r\nvicinity of Father M'Fadden's house, quite the best structure in the\r\nplace after the chapel and the hotel. It is of stone, with a neat side\r\nporch, in which, as I drove up, I descried Father M'Fadden, in his trim\r\nwell-fitting clerical costume, standing and talking with an elderly\r\nlady. I passed through a handsome iron wicket, and introduced myself to\r\nhim. He received me with much courtesy, and asked me to walk into his\r\nwell-furnished comfortable study, where a lady, his sister, to whom he\r\npresented me, sat reading by the fire.\r\n\r\nI told Father M'Fadden I had come to get his view of methods and things\r\nat Gweedore, and he gave it to me with great freedom and fluency. He is\r\na typical Celt in appearance, a M'Fadden Roe, sanguine by temperament,\r\nwith an expression at once shrewd and enthusiastic, a most flexible\r\npersuasive voice. All the trouble at Gweedore, he thought, came of the\r\nagents. \"Agents had been the curse both of Ireland and of the landlord.\r\nThe custom being to pay them by commissions on the sums collected, and\r\nnot a regular salary, the more they can screw either out of the soil, or\r\nout of any other resources of the tenants, the better it is for them. At\r\nGweedore the people earn what they can, not out of the soil, but out of\r\ntheir labour exported to Scotland, or England, or America. Only\r\nyesterday,\" he continued, turning to his neat mahogany desk and taking\r\nup a letter, \"I received this with a remittance from America to pay the\r\nrent of one of my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was in connection,\" I asked, \"with the 'Plan of Campaign' and your\r\ncontest here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"and a girl of my parish went over to Scotland\r\nherself and got the money due there for another family, and brought it\r\nback to me here. You see they make me a kind of savings-bank, and have\r\ndone so for a long time, long before the 'Plan of Campaign' was talked\r\nabout as it is now.\"\r\n\r\nThis was interesting, as I had heard it said by a Nationalist in Dublin\r\nthat the \"Plan of Campaign\" was originally suggested by Father M'Fadden.\r\nHe made no such claim himself, however, and I made no allusion to this\r\naspect of the matter. \"I have been living here for fifteen years, and\r\nthey listen to me as to nobody else.\"\r\n\r\nIn these affairs with the agents, he had always told his people that\r\n\"whenever a settlement came to be made, cash alone in the hand of the\r\nperson representing them could make it properly.\" \"Cash I must have,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and hold the cash ready for the moment. When I had worked out a\r\nsettlement with Captain Hill, I had a good part of the money in my hand\r\nready to pay down. £1450 was the sum total agreed upon, and after the\r\nfurther collection, necessitated by the settlement, there was a deficit\r\nof about £200. I wrote to Professor Stuart,\" he added, after a pause,\r\n\"that I wanted about £200 of the sum-total. But more has come in since\r\nthen. This remittance, from America yesterday, for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they send such remittances without being asked for them?\" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they are now and again sending money, and some of them don't send,\r\nbut bring it. Some of them go out to America now as they used to go to\r\nEngland--just to work and earn some money, and come back.\r\n\r\n\"If they get on tolerably well they stay for a while, but they find\r\nAmerica is more expensive than Ireland, and if, for any cause, they get\r\nout of work there, they come back to Ireland to spend what they have.\r\nNaturally, you see,\" said Father M'Fadden, \"they find a certain pleasure\r\nto be seen by their old friends in the old place, after borrowing the\r\nfour pounds perhaps to take them to America, coming back with the money\r\njingling in their pockets, and in good clothes, and with a watch and a\r\nchain--and a high hat. And there is in the heart of the Irishman an\r\neternal longing for his native land constantly luring him back to\r\nIreland. All do not succeed, though, in your country,\" he said. \"We hear\r\nof two out of ten perhaps who do very well. They take care we hear of\r\nthat. The rest disappear, and are never heard of again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not encourage emigration?\" I, asked, \"even although the\r\npeople cannot earn their living from the soil?\"\r\n\r\nFather M'Fadden hesitated a moment, and then replied, \"No, for things\r\nshould be so arranged that they may earn their living, not out of the\r\ncountry, but on the soil at home. It is to that I want to bring the\r\ncondition of the district.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Lord Ernest Hamilton came up and knocked at the door. He\r\nwas most courteously received by Father M'Fadden. To my query why the\r\nCourts could not intervene to save the priests from taking all this\r\ntrouble on themselves between the owners and the occupiers of the land,\r\nFather M'Fadden at first replied that the Courts had no power to\r\nintervene where, as in many cases in Gweedore, the holdings are\r\nsubdivided.\r\n\r\n\"The Courts,\" he said, \"may not be, and I do not think they are, all\r\nthat could be desired, though they undoubtedly do supply a more or less\r\nimpartial arbitrator between the landlord and the tenant. It is an\r\nimprovement on the past when the landlords fixed the rents for\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nI did not remind him of what Lord George Hill tells us, that in the\r\nolden time at Gweedore the tenants fixed their own rents--and then did\r\nnot pay them--but I asked him how this could be said when the tenant\r\nclearly must have accepted the rent, no matter who fixed it. \"Oh!\" said\r\nFather M'Fadden, \"that may be so, but the tenant was not free, he was\r\ncoerced. With all his life and labour represented in the holding and its\r\nimprovements, he could not go and give up his holding. It's a\r\nstand-and-deliver business with him--the landlord puts a pistol to his\r\nhead!\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it not true,\" I said, \"that under the new Land Bill the Land\r\nCommissioner's Court has power to fix the rents judicially without\r\nregard to landlord or tenant during fifteen years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so,\" said Father M'Fadden. \"Under Mr. Gladstone's Act of\r\n81, and under the later Act of the present Government, the rents so\r\nfixed from '81 to '86 inclusive are subject to revision for three years;\r\nbut the people have no confidence in the constitution of the Courts,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, the improvements of the tenants are\r\nconfiscated under the Act of '81, and the reductions allowed under the\r\nAct of '87 are incommensurate with the fall in prices by 100 per cent.\r\nAnd there still remains the burden of arrears. I feel that I must stand\r\nbetween my people and obligations which they are unable to meet. To that\r\nend I take their money, and stand ready to use it to relieve them when\r\nthe occasion offers. That is my idea of my work under the 'Plan of\r\nCampaign'; and, furthermore, I think that by doing it I have secured\r\nmoney for the landlord which he couldn't possibly have got in any other\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nThis struck me as a very remarkable statement, nor can I see how it can\r\nbe interpreted otherwise than as an admission that if the people had\r\nthe money to pay their rents, they couldn't be trusted to use it for\r\nthat purpose, unless they put it into the control of the priest or of\r\nsome other trustee.\r\n\r\nReverting to what he had said of the necessity for some change in the\r\nconditions of life and labour here, I asked if, in his opinion, the\r\npeople could live out of the land if they got the ownership of it.\r\n\r\nIn existing circumstances he thought they could not.\r\n\r\nWas he in favour, then, of Mr. Davitt's plan of Land Nationalisation?\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have not considered the question of Nationalisation of the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nTo my further question, What remedies he would himself propose for a\r\nstate of things in which it was impossible for the people to live out of\r\nthe land either as occupiers or as owners--emigration being barred,\r\nFather M'Fadden, without looking at Lord Ernest, replied, \"Oh, I think\r\nabler men who draw up Parliamentary Acts and live in public life ought\r\nto devise remedies, and that is a matter which would be best settled by\r\na Home Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe glove was well delivered, but Lord Ernest did not lift it.\r\n\r\n\"But, Father M'Fadden,\" I said, \"I am told you are a practical\r\nagriculturist and engineer, and that you have contrived to get excellent\r\nwork done by the people here, dividing them off into working squads, and\r\nassigning so many perches to so many--surely then you must understand\r\nbetter than a dozen members of Parliament what they can be got to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at this, and finally admitted that he had a plan of his own.\r\nIt was that the Government should advance sums for reclaiming the land.\r\n\"The people could live on part of their earnings while thus employed,\r\nand invest the surplus in sheep to be fed on the hill pastures. When the\r\nreclamation was effected the families could be scattered out, and the\r\nholdings increased. In this district alone there are 350 holdings of\r\nreclaimable land of 20 acres each, the reclamation of which, according\r\nto a competent surveyor, \"would pay well.\" And the district could be\r\nimproved by creating employment on the spot, establishing factories,\r\ndeveloping fisheries, giving technical education, and encouraging\r\ncottage industries, which are so vigorously reviving in this district\r\nowing to the benevolent efforts of the Donegal Industrial Fund.\"\r\n\r\nFather M'Fadden spoke freely and without undue heat of his trial, and\r\ngave us a piquant account of his arrest.\r\n\r\nThis was effected at Armagh, just as he was getting into an early\r\nmorning train. A sergeant of police walked up as the train was about to\r\nstart, and asked--\r\n\r\n\"Are you not Father M'Fadden of Gweedore?\"\r\n\r\n\"What interest have you in my identity?\" responded the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Only this, sir,\" said the officer, politely exhibiting a warrant.\r\n\r\n\"I had been in Armagh the previous day,\" said Father M'Fadden,\r\n\"attending the month's memory of the late deceased Primate of All\r\nIreland, Dr. M'Gettigan, and stayed at a private residence, that of\r\nSurgeon-Major Lavery, not suspecting that while enjoying the genial\r\nhospitality of the Surgeon-Major my steps were dogged by a detective,\r\nand that gentleman's house watched by police.\"\r\n\r\nOf the trial Father M'Fadden spoke with more bitterness. His eyes glowed\r\nas he exclaimed, \"Can you imagine that they refused me bail, when bail\r\nhad been allowed to such a felon as Arthur Orton? Why should I have\r\nbeen locked up over two Sundays, for ten days, when I offered to pledge\r\nmy honour to appear?\" He made no other complaint of the magistrate, and\r\nnone of the prosecutor, Mr. Ross. He praised his own lawyer, too, but he\r\nstrongly denounced the stenographer who took down his speech, or the\r\nparts of it which I told him I had seen in Dublin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, just think of it,\" he exclaimed; \"it took the clerk just eight\r\nminutes to read the report given by that stenographer of a speech which\r\nit took me an hour and twenty minutes to deliver! I do not speak from\r\nthe lips, I speak from the heart, and consequently rather rapidly; and a\r\nstenographer who can take down 190 words a minute has told me I run\r\nahead of him!\"\r\n\r\nI suggested that the report, without pretending even to be a full\r\nsummary of his speech, might be accurate as to phrases and sentences\r\npronounced by him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as to phrases,\" he answered, \"that might be; but the phrases may\r\nbe taken out of their true connection, and strung together in an\r\nuntruthful, yet telling way. Even my words were not fully set down,\" he\r\nsaid, with some heat. \"I was made to call a man 'level,' when I said in\r\nthe American way that he was 'level-headed.'\" _A propos_ of this, I am\r\ntold that the American word \"spree\" has become Hibernian, and is used to\r\ndescribe meetings of the National League and \"other political\r\nentertainments.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I told Father M'Fadden I had just come from Rome, where, as I had\r\nreason to believe, the Vatican was anxious to get evidence from others\r\nthan Archbishop Walsh and Monsignore Kirby, of the Irish College, as to\r\nthe attitude of the priests in Ireland towards the laws of the United\r\nKingdom, he said he knew that \"some Italian prelates neither understood\r\nnor approved the 'Plan of Campaign,' nor is the Irish Land question\r\nunderstood at Rome;\" but this did not seem to disturb him much, as he\r\nwas quite sure that in the end the \"Plan of Campaign\" would be legalised\r\nby the British Government. \"I think I see plainly,\" he said, \"that Lord\r\nErnest's government is fast going to pieces, though I can't expect him\r\nto admit it!\" Lord Ernest laughed good-naturedly, and said that Father\r\nM'Fadden saw more in Donegal than he (Lord Ernest) was able to see in\r\nWestminster. Upon my asking him whether the \"Plan of Campaign\" did not\r\nin effect abrogate the moral duty of a man to meet the legal obligations\r\nhe had voluntarily incurred, Father M'Fadden advanced his own theory of\r\nthe subject, which was that, \"if a man can pay a fair year's rent out of\r\nthe produce of his holding, he is bound to pay it. But if the rent be a\r\nrack-rent, imposed on the tenant against his will, or if the holding\r\ndoes not produce the rent, then I don't think that is a strict\r\nobligation in conscience.\"\r\n\r\nIn America, the courts, I fear, would make short work of this theory of\r\nFather M'Fadden. If a tenant there cannot pay his first quarter's rent\r\n(they don't let him darken his soul by a year's liabilities) they\r\npromptly and mercilessly put him out.\r\n\r\nInteresting as was our conversation with the parish priest of Gweedore,\r\nI felt that we might be trespassing too far upon his kindness and his\r\ntime. So we rose to go. He insisted upon our going into the dining-room,\r\nwhere, as he told us, he had hospitably entertained sundry visiting\r\nstatesmen from England, and there offered us a glass of the excellent\r\nwine of the country. He excused himself from joining us as being\r\n\"almost a teetotaller.\"\r\n\r\nOn our return to the hotel I met the Galwegian strolling about. When I\r\ntold him of Father M'Fadden's courteous hospitality, he said, \"I am very\r\nglad you took that glass he offered. I really believe his quarrel with\r\nCaptain Hill dates back to Hill's declining that same courtesy under\r\nFather M'Fadden's roof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGWEEDORE, _Monday, Feb. 6._--Another very beautiful morning--as a farmer\r\nsaid with whom I chatted on my morning stroll, \"A grand day, sorr!\"\r\nErrigal, which in this mountain atmosphere seems almost to hang over our\r\nhotel, but is in reality three or four miles away, stood out superbly\r\nagainst a clear azure sky, wreaths of soft luminous mist floating like a\r\ndivine girdle half way up his bare volcanic peak.\r\n\r\nI walked up to the Bunbeg road with Lord Ernest to call upon some\r\npeasants whom he knows. In one stone cabin, very well built and\r\nplastered, standing sidewise to the road, with doors on either side, we\r\nfound the house apparently in charge of a little girl of nine or ten\r\nyears, a weird but pretty child with very delicate well-cut features,\r\nwho lay couchant upon her doubled-up arm on a low bed in a corner of the\r\nmain room, and peered at us over her elbow with sparkling inquisitive\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nBy her side sat a man with his cap on, who might have been the \"young\r\nPretender,\" or the \"old Kaiser,\" so far as his looks went towards\r\nindicating his age. He never rose or welcomed us, being, as we\r\nafterwards found out, only a visitor like ourselves, and a kinsman of\r\nMrs. M'Donnell, the head of the house. \"Mrs. M'Donnell,\" he said, \"is\r\ngone to the store at Bunbeg.\"\r\n\r\nThis main room rose perhaps ten feet in height to the open roof. It had\r\none large and well-glazed window. When Lord George Hill came here there\r\nwere not ten square feet of window-glass in the whole parish outside of\r\nthe Church, the national school, and the residence of the chief\r\npolice-officer.\r\n\r\nWindows when there were any were closed with dried sheepskins, through\r\nwhich the cats ran in and out as freely as through the curious tunnel\r\nwhich the kindly Master of Blantyre has constructed at Sheba's Cross for\r\ntheir special benefit.\r\n\r\nThere were two beds in the main room; rather high than low, one of\r\nrushes, on which lay the child of whom I have spoken, and one of\r\ngreater pretensions vacant in another corner.\r\n\r\nThe door stood wide open, but the cabin was warm and comfortable, and a\r\npeat fire smouldered, sending up, to me, most agreeable odours. An inner\r\nroom seemed to be a sort of granary, full of hay and straw. There the\r\ncow is kept at night. \"It's handy if you want a drink of milk,\" said the\r\nvisitor. In comparison with the dwellings of small farmers in Eastern\r\nFrance or in Southern Italy this Donegal cabin was not only clean but\r\nattractive. It was more squalid perhaps, but less dreary than the\r\nextemporised and flimsy dwellings of settlers in the extreme Far West of\r\nthe United States, and I should say decidedly a more wholesome\r\nhabitation than the hermetically sealed and dismal wooden houses of\r\nhundreds of struggling farmers in the older Eastern States. I am sure my\r\nold friend Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted, who made the only thorough surveys\r\nof agricultural life in the United States before the Civil War, would\r\nhave pronounced it in all respects superior, so far as health and\r\ncomfort go, to the average home of the average \"poor buccra,\" between\r\nthe Chesapeake and the Sabine. I am afraid a great deal of not wholly\r\ninnocuous nonsense has been written and spoken about this part of the\r\nUnited Kingdom by well-meaning philanthropists who have gauged the\r\ncondition of the people here by their own standards of comfort and\r\nenjoyment. Most things in this life of ours are relative. I well\r\nremember hearing an American millionaire, who began life in New York as\r\nthe patentee of a mouse-trap, express his profound compassion for a\r\njudge of the Supreme Court condemned to live \"upon a pittance of eight\r\nthousand dollars a year.\"\r\n\r\nThese dwellers in the cabins of Donegal are millionaires, so far as\r\nthose essentials of life are concerned, which we call room and air and\r\nfreedom to move and breathe, in comparison with hundreds and thousands\r\nof their own race in the slums of New York and Chicago and Liverpool and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nMrs. M'Donnell's cousin, however, took dark views of things. The times\r\n\"were no good at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe potatoes, I had heard, were doing well this year.\r\n\r\n\"No! they wouldn't keep the people; indeed, they wouldn't. There would\r\nhave to be relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not manure the land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Manure? oh yes, the sea-stuff was good manure, but the people couldn't\r\nget it. They had no boats; and it cost eighteenpence a load to haul it\r\nfrom Bunbeg. No! they couldn't get it off the rocks. At the Rosses they\r\nmight; the Rosses were not so badly off as Derrybeg or Gweedore, for all\r\nthey might say.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Father M'Fadden had urged me,\" I said, \"to see the Rosses, because\r\nthe people there were worse off than any of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Father M'Fadden was a good man; he was a friend of the people;\r\nand they were bad indeed at the Rosses, but they could get the sea-stuff\r\nthere, and hadn't to pay for cartage. And indeed, if you put the\r\nsea-stuff on the bogland, the land was better in among the rocks' at the\r\nRosses than was the bogland, it was indeed: the stuff did no good at all\r\nthe first year. The second and the third it gave good crops--but then\r\nyou must burn it--and by the fourth year and the fifth it was all ashes,\r\nand no good at all! This was God's truth, it was; and there must be\r\nrelief.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could the people earn nothing in Scotland or in Tyrone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, they could earn nothing at all. They could pay no rent.\"\r\n\r\nSo he sat there, a Jeremiah among the potsherds, quite contented and\r\nmiserable--well and hearty in a ragged frieze coat, with his hat over\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nWhile we talked, a tall lusty young beggar-girl wandered in and out\r\nunnoticed. Chickens pecked and fluttered about, and at intervals the\r\ninevitable small dog suddenly barked and yelped.\r\n\r\nOn our way back we met the elder daughter of Mrs. M'Donnell, a girl of\r\nsixteen, the \"beauty of Gweedore.\" A beauty she certainly is, and of a\r\ntype hardly to have been looked for here.\r\n\r\nHer lithe graceful figure, her fine, small, chiselled features, her\r\nshapely little head rather defiantly set on her sloping shoulders, her\r\nfair complexion and clear hazel eyes, her brown golden hair gathered up\r\nbehind into a kind of tress, all these were Saxon rather than Celtic.\r\nHer trim neat ankles were bare, after the mountain fashion, but she was\r\nprettily dressed in a well-fitting dark blue gown, wore a smartly\r\ntrimmed muslin apron, with lace about her throat, and carried over her\r\narm a new woollen shawl, very tasteful and quiet in colour. She greeted\r\nus with a self-possessed smile.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she had not, been shopping with her mother. The shawl was a\r\npresent from one of her cousins. Did we not think it very pretty? She\r\nwas only out for a walk, and had no notion where her mother might be. A\r\nstalwart red-bearded man who lounged and loitered behind her on the road\r\nwas \"only a friend,\" she said, \"not a relation at all!\" Nor did she\r\nshow, I am sorry to say, any compassion for the evident uneasiness with\r\nwhich, from a distance, he regarded her long and affable parley with two\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nWe asked her whether she expected and wished to live in Gweedore, or\r\nwould like to follow elsewhere some calling or trade. \"Oh yes,\" she\r\nunhesitatingly replied, \"I should like to be a dress-maker in Deny;\r\nbut,\" she added pensively, \"it's no use my thinking about it, for I know\r\nI shouldn't be let!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you like Dublin as well?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; but I shouldn't be let go to Dublin either!\"\r\n\r\nWould she like to go to America?\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she didn't think much of \"the Americans who came back,\" and\r\nAmerica must be \"a very hard country for work, and very cold in the\r\nwinter.\"\r\n\r\nNow this was a widow's daughter, living in such a cabin as I have\r\ndescribed, and upon a small holding in a parish reputed to be the most\r\n\"distressful\" in Donegal![15]\r\n\r\nReturning to the hotel we found our car ready for Falcarragh. Our driver\r\nwas a quiet, sensible fellow, who did not seem to care sixpence about\r\nthe great Nationality question, though he knew the country very well.\r\n\r\nIron was visible in the rocks as we drove along, and we passed some\r\nabandoned mining works, \"lead and silver mines;\" he said, \"they were\r\ngiven up long before his time.\" We got many fine views of the mountains\r\nErrigal, Aghla More, and Muckish. Lough Altan, a wild tarn, lies between\r\nErrigal and Aghla More.\r\n\r\nThe peasants we met stared at us curiously, but, were very civil, even\r\nat a place bearing the ominous name of Bedlam, against which Mr. Burke\r\nhad warned us as the most troublesome on the way. All the countryside\r\nwas there attending a fair, and we drove through throngs of red-shawled,\r\nbarelegged women, ponies, horses, cattle, and sheep. Of Tory Island,\r\nwith its famous tower, dating back to the fabled \"Fomorians,\" we had\r\nsome grand glimpses. The white surf, flashing and leaping high in the\r\nair on the nearer islets accented and gave life to the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn one glorious landlocked bay, we saw not a single boat riding. Our\r\ndriver said, \"The fishermen all live on Tory Island, and send their fish\r\nto Sligo. The people on the mainland don't like going out in the boats.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ernest tells me there is a movement to have a telegraph station set\r\nup on Tory Island, to announce the Canadian steamers coming into Moville\r\nfor Deny.\r\n\r\nWe found Falcarragh, or \"Cross-Roads,\" a large clean-looking village,\r\nconsisting of one long and broad street, through which horses and cattle\r\nwere wandering in numbers, apparently at their own sweet will.\r\n\r\nBallyconnell House, the seat of Mr. Wybrants Olphert, is the manor house\r\nof the place. As we drew near, no signs appeared of the dreadful\r\n\"Boycott.\" The great gates of the park stood hospitably open, and we\r\ndrove in unchallenged past a pretty ivy-clad lodge, and through low, but\r\nthickly planted groves. A huge boulder, ruddy with iron ore, bears the\r\nuncanny and unspellable name of the \"Clockchinnfhaelaidh,\" or \"Stone of\r\nKinfaele.\" Upon this stone, tradition tells us, Balor, a giant of Tory\r\nIsland, chopped off the head of an unreasonable person named\r\nMackinfeale, for complaining that Balor, under some prehistoric \"Plan of\r\nCampaign,\" had driven away his favourite cow, Glasgavlan.\r\n\r\nBallyconnell House, a substantial mansion of the Georgian era, stands\r\nextremely well. Over a fine sloping lawn in front, you have a glorious\r\nview of the sea, and of a very fine headland, known as \"the Duke's\r\nHead,\" from the really remarkable resemblance it bears to the profile of\r\nWellington. The winds have such power here that there are but few\r\nwell-grown trees, and those near the house. About them paraded many\r\ngame-hens, spirited birds, looking like pheasants. These, as we learned,\r\nnever sleep save in the trees.\r\n\r\nThe \"boycotted\" lord of the manor came out to greet us--a handsome,\r\nstalwart man of some seventy years, with a kindly face, and most\r\ncharming manners. His family, presumably of Dutch origin, has been\r\nestablished here since Charles II. He himself holds 18,133 acres here,\r\nvalued at £1802 a year; and he is a resident landlord in the fullest\r\nsense of the term. For fifty years he has lived here, during all which\r\ntime, as he told us to-day, he has \"never slept for a week out of the\r\ncountry.\" His furthest excursions of late years have been to Raphoe,\r\nwhere he has a married daughter. \"Absenteeism\" clearly has nothing to do\r\nwith the quarrel between Mr. Olphert and his tenants, or with the\r\n\"boycotting\" of Ballyconnell.\r\n\r\nThe dragoons from Dunfanaghy had just ridden away as we came up. They\r\nhad come over in full fig to show themselves, and to encourage the\r\nrespectable Catholics of Falcarragh, who side with their parish priest,\r\nFather M'Fadden of Glena, and object to the vehement measures, promoted\r\nby his young curate, Father Stephens, recently of Liverpool. The people\r\nhad received them with much satisfaction. \"They had never seen the\r\ncavalry before, and were much delighted!\"\r\n\r\nBefore we sat down to luncheon young Mr. Olphert came in. It was curious\r\nto see this quiet, well-bred young gentleman throw down his belt and his\r\nrevolver on the hall table, like his gloves and his umbrella. \"Quite\r\nlike the Far West,\" I said. \"And we are as far in the West as we can\r\nget,\" he replied laughingly.\r\n\r\nOur luncheon was excellent--so good, in fact, that we felt a kind of\r\nremorse as if we had selfishly quartered ourselves upon a beleaguered\r\ngarrison. But Mr. Olphert said he had no fear of being starved out.\r\nPersonally he was, and always had been, on the best terms with the\r\npeople of Falcarragh. The older tenants, even now, if he met them\r\nwalking in the fields when no one was in sight, would come up and salute\r\nhim, and say how \"disgusted\" they were with what was going on. It was\r\nthe younger generation who were troublesome--more troublesome, he added,\r\nto their own parish priest than they were to him. Three or four years\r\nago a returned American Irishman, an avowed unbeliever, but an active\r\nNationalist and one of Mr. Forster's \"suspects,\" had come into the\r\nneighbourhood and done his worst to break up the parish. He used to come\r\nto Falcarragh on a Sunday, and get up on a stone outside the chapel\r\nwhile Father M'Fadden was saying Mass or preaching, and harangue such\r\npeople as would listen to him, and caricature the priest and the sermon\r\ngoing on within sound of his own voice. \"I am myself a Protestant,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Olphert, \"but I have a great respect for priests who do their\r\nduty; and the conduct of Father M'Fadden of Gweedore, in countenancing\r\nthis man, who tried to overthrow the authority of Father M'Fadden of\r\nGlena, excited my indignation. As to what is going on now,\" said Mr.\r\nOlphert, \"it is to Father M'Fadden of Gweedore, and to Father Stephens\r\nhere, that the trouble is chiefly to be charged.\" This tallies with what\r\nI heard at Gweedore from my Galwegian acquaintance. He thought Mr.\r\nOlphert, and Mr. Hewson, the agent, ought to have made peace on the\r\nterms which Father Stephens said he was willing to accept for the\r\ntenants, these being a reduction of 3s. 4d. in the pound, if Mr. Olphert\r\nwould extend the reduction to the whole year. My Galwegian thought this\r\nreasonable, because in this region the rent, it appears, is only\r\ncollected once a year. With this impartial temper, my Galwegian still\r\nmaintained that but for the two priests--the parish priest of Gweedore\r\nand the curate of Falcarragh--there need have been no trouble at\r\nFalcarragh. There had been no \"evictions.\" When the tenants first went\r\nto Mr. Olphert they asked a reduction of 4s. in the pound on the\r\nnon-judicial rents, and this Mr. Olphert at once agreed to give them.\r\nThe tenants had regularly paid their rents for ten years before. That\r\nthey are not going down in the world would appear from the fact that the\r\nP.O. Savings Banks' deposits at Falcarragh, which stood at £62, 15s.\r\n10d. in 1880, rose in 1887 to £494, 10s. 8d. A small number of them had\r\ngone into Court and had judicial rents fixed; and it was on the\r\ncontention promoted by the two priests, through these judicial tenants,\r\nhe said, that all the difficulty hinged. Father M'Fadden of Glena, who\r\nthought the quarrel unjustifiable and silly, had an interview with Mr.\r\nBlane, M.P., and with Father Stephens, and tried to arrange it all. He\r\nwould have succeeded, my Galwegian thought, had not the agent, Mr.\r\nHewson, obstinately fought with the obstinate curate, Father Stephens,\r\nover the suggestion made by the latter, that the terms granted on the\r\nfine neighbouring estate of Mr. Stuart of Ards--a man of wealth, who\r\nlives mainly at Brighton, though Ards is one of the loveliest places in\r\nIreland--should be extended by Mr. Olphert for a whole year to his own\r\npeople, who had never asked for anything of the kind!\r\n\r\nMr. Olphert said he knew Gweedore well. He owns a \"townland\"[16] there,\r\non which he has thirty-five tenants, none of them on a holding at more\r\nmore than £4 a year. Father M'Fadden of Gweedore, he said, finding that\r\nthe people on Mr. Olphert's townland were going back to the \"Rundale\"\r\npractices, tried to induce Mr. Olphert to return all these subdivisions\r\nas \"tenancies.\" This he refused to do. As to the resources of the\r\npeasantry, he thought them greater than they appeared to be. \"This comes\r\nto light,\" said Mr. Olphert, \"whenever there is a tenant-right for sale.\r\nThere is never any lack of money to buy it, and at a round good price.\"\r\nThe people also, he thinks, spend a great deal on what they regard as\r\nluxuries, and particularly on tea. \"A cup of tea could not be got for\r\nlove or money in Gweedore, when Lord George Hill came there. You might\r\nas well have asked for a glass of Tokay.\"\r\n\r\nNow they use and abuse it in the most deleterious way imaginable. They\r\nbuy the tea at exorbitant rates, often at five shillings a pound, and\r\nusually on credit, paying a part of one bill on running up another, put\r\nit into a saucepan or an iron pot, and boil, or rather stew, it over the\r\nfire, till they brew a kind of hell-broth, which they imbibe at odd\r\nmoments all day long! Oddly enough, this is the way in which they\r\nprepare tea in Cashmere and other parts of India, with this essential\r\ndifference, though, that the Orientals mitigate the astringency of the\r\nherb with milk and almonds and divers ingredients, tending to make a\r\nsort of \"compote\" of it. Taken as it is taken here, it must have a\r\ntremendous effect on the nerves. Mr. Olphert thinks it has had much to\r\ndo with the increase of lunacy in Ireland of late years. From his\r\nofficial connection with the asylum at Letterkenny, he knows that while\r\nit used to accommodate the lunatics of three counties, it is now hardly\r\nadequate to the needs of Donegal alone.\r\n\r\nEverything about Ballyconnell House is out of key with the actual\r\nmilitary conditions of life here. It is essentially what Tennyson calls\r\n\"an ancient home of ordered peace.\" In the ample hall hang old portraits\r\nand trophies of the chase. The large and handsome library, panelled in\r\nrich dark wood, is filled full of well-bound books. Prints, busts, the\r\nthousand and one things of \"bigotry and virtue\" which mark the\r\ndwelling-place of educated and thoughtful people are to be seen on every\r\nside. Mr. Olphert showed us a cabinet full of bronzes, picked up on the\r\nstrand of the sea. Among these were brooches, pins, clasps, buckles, two\r\nvery fine bronze swords, and a pair of bronze links engraved with\r\ndistinctly Masonic emblems, such as the level, the square, and the\r\ncompasses. When were these things made, and by what people?\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, Masonry in the British Islands cannot be historically\r\ntraced back much, if at all, beyond the Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nMr. Olphert and his son walked about the place with us. They have no\r\nfears of an attack, but think it wise to keep a force of police on the\r\npremises. The only demonstration yet made of any kind against the house\r\nwas the march from Falcarragh some time ago of a mob of young men, who\r\npromptly withdrew on catching sight of half-a-dozen policemen within the\r\npark gates. As to getting his work done, some of his people had steadily\r\nrefused to acknowledge the \"boycott,\" and they were now strengthened by\r\nthe attitude of those who had surrendered to the pressure, and were now\r\nsullen and angry with the League which had given them nothing to do, and\r\nno supplies.\r\n\r\nAt Falcarragh we met a person who knew much about the late Lord Leitrim,\r\nwho was murdered in this neighbourhood on the highway some years ago. He\r\nspoke freely of the murderer by name, as if it were matter of common\r\nnotoriety. Of the murdered man, he said that he had made himself\r\nextremely unpopular and odious, not so much by certain immoralities\r\nfreely alleged at the time of his death, as by vexatious meddling with\r\nthe prejudices and whims of his tenants. \"He used to go into the houses\r\nand pull down cartoons and placards, if he saw them put up on the\r\nwalls.\" \"No! he had no party feeling in the matter; he used to pull down\r\nWilliam III. and the Pope with an equal hand.\" It seems that in this\r\nregion, too, a local legend has grown up of the birth at a place called\r\nCashelmore of a \"Queen of France.\" The case is worth noting as throwing\r\nlight on the genesis and accuracy of local traditions. The \"Queen of\r\nFrance\" referred to proves, on inquiry, to have been Miss Patterson, who\r\nmarried Jerome Bonaparte, brother of the first Emperor, afterwards\r\ncreated by him King of Westphalia! This Avas the lady so well known in\r\nAmerica as Mrs. Patterson Bonaparte of Baltimore, who died at a great\r\nage only a few years ago. I have no reason to suppose that she was born\r\nat Cashelmore at all or in Ireland. But her father, reputed in the time\r\nof Washington to be the richest man in the United States, who came from\r\nthe North of Ireland and settled in Baltimore as a merchant, may very\r\nwell have been born there.\r\n\r\nTo my great regret Father M'Fadden of Glena, or Falcarragh, was absent\r\nfrom home. As we drove homeward we met on the way a young lady on a\r\nsmart jaunting-car, with a servant in livery. This was the daughter, our\r\ndriver told us, of Mr. Griffiths, the Protestant clergyman, past whose\r\nresidence our road lay. His church stands high upon a commanding cliff,\r\nand is a feature in the landscape. We met the parson himself also,\r\nwalking with a friend. The road from Bedlam to Derrybeg goes by a region\r\nof the \"Rosses,\" reputed the most woe-begone part of the Gweedore\r\ndistrict. This is the scene of a curious tale told about Father M'Fadden\r\nof Gweedore, by his ill-wishers in these parts, to the effect that he\r\nadvises English Members of Parliament and other \"sympathising\" visitors\r\nwho come here to make a pilgrimage to \"the Bosses,\" where, no matter at\r\nwhat time of day they appear, they invariably find sundry of the people\r\nsitting in their huts and eating stewed seaweed out of iron pots. I\r\ncannot vouch for this tale, but certainly I have seen no people here of\r\neither sex, or of any age, who look as if they lived on stewed seaweed.\r\nAnother person at Falcarragh told us, as an illustration of the\r\ninfluence exerted by Father M'Fadden of Gweedore, in this parish, over\r\nwhich he has no proper authority, that, in obedience to an intimation\r\nfrom him, the persons whose seats in the chapel had been occupied on two\r\nsuccessive Sundays by the policemen now stationed here, yesterday\r\nrefused to allow the policemen to occupy them, the only exception being\r\nin the case of a man who had been arrested at the same time with Father\r\nStephens, and who had been so well treated by the police, that he felt\r\nbound to repay their courtesy by offering one of them his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNGLOE, _Tuesday, Feb. 7._--We rose early this morning at Gweedore; the\r\nsun shining so brightly that we were forced to drop the window-shades at\r\nbreakfast, while I read my letter from Rome, telling me of the bitter\r\ncold there, and of a slight snow-fall last week. Here the birds were\r\nsinging, and the air was as soft and exhilarating as that of an April\r\nmorning in the Highlands of Mexico or Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nOur host gave us a capital car, with a staunch nag and a wide-awake\r\njarvey, thanks to all which I found the thirteen miles drive to this\r\nplace too short. No doubt it will be a great thing for Donegal when\r\n\"light railways\" are laid down here. But I pity the traveller of the\r\nfuture here, if he is never to know the delight of traversing these wild\r\nand picturesque wastes in such weather as we have had to-day, on a car,\r\nwell-balanced by a single pleasant companion, drinking, as he goes,\r\ndeep draughts of the Atlantic air! Truly on a jaunting-car \"two are\r\ncompany and three are none.\" You have almost the free companionship of a\r\nSouth American journey in the saddle, jumping off to walk, when you\r\nlike, more freely still.\r\n\r\nWe drove near the house of the \"beauty of Gweedore,\" but she was not\r\nvisible, though we met her mother (by no means a _pulchra mater_) as we\r\ncrossed the Clady at Bryan's Bridge.\r\n\r\nWe soon passed from the bogland into a wilderness of granite. Our\r\njarvey, however, maintained that there was \"better land among the stones\r\nthan any bogland could be.\" He was a shrewd fellow, and summed up the\r\neconomical situation, I thought, better than some of his betters, when\r\nhe said of the whole region that \"it will fatten four, feed five, and\r\nstarve six.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well fatten six, though, I should say, if the natural wealth of\r\nthis vast granite range can be properly turned to account. On every side\r\nof us lay vast blocks of granite of all hues and grades, all absolutely\r\nunworked, but surely not unworkable. We stopped and picked up many\r\nspecimens, some of them almost as rich in colour as porphyry. Of lakes\r\nand lakelets supplying water-power the name too, is legion.\r\n\r\nBeyond Annagary we caught a glimpse of the Isle of Arran, the scene, a\r\nfew years ago, of so much suffering, and that of a kind I should think\r\nas much beyond the control of legislation as the misery and destruction\r\nwhich have overtaken successive attempts to establish settlements on\r\nAnticosti in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThis town of Dungloe sprawls along the shore of the sea. It is reputed\r\nthe most ill-favoured town in Donegal, and it certainly is not a dream\r\nof beauty. But it blooms all over with evidences of the prosperity of\r\nthat interesting type of Irish civilisation, the \"Gombeen man,\" of whom\r\nI had heard so much at Gweedore. Over the doorways of most of the shops\r\nappear the names of various members of the family of Sweeney, all of\r\nthem, I am told, brought here and established within a few years past by\r\nthe head of the sept, who is not only the great \"Gombeen man\" of the\r\nregion, but a leading local member of the National League, and Her\r\nMajesty's Postmaster. The Sweeneys, in fact, commercially speaking,\r\ndominate Dungloe, their, only visible rivals being a returned Irish\r\nAmerican, who has built himself a neat two-story house and shop just at\r\nthe entrance of the village, and our own host, Mr. Maurice Boyle, whose\r\nextremely neat little inn just faces a large shop, the stronghold of the\r\nChief of the Sweeneys. I am sorry to find that this important citizen of\r\nDungloe is not now here. We went into his chief establishment to make\r\nsome purchases, and found it full of customers, chiefly women, neatly\r\ndressed after the Donegal fashion, and busily chaffering with the\r\nshopgirls and shopmen, who had their hands full, exhibiting goods such\r\nas certainly would not be found in any New York or New England village\r\nof this sort. When we secured the attention of the chief shopman, a\r\nnattily dressed, dark-haired young man who would not have discredited\r\nthe largest \"store\" in Grand Street or the Bowery of New York, we asked\r\nhim to show us some of the home-made woollen goods of the country.\r\nThese, he assured us, had no sale in Dungloe, and he did not keep them.\r\nBut he showed us piles of handsome Scottish tweeds at much higher\r\nprices. Now as this is an exclusively agricultural region, it is evident\r\nthat the tenants must be able to make it worth a trader's while to keep\r\non hand such goods as we here found, and therefore that they cannot be\r\nexactly on \"the ragged edge\" of things.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweeney is also the proprietor of the chief \"hotel\" of Dungloe; our\r\nhost, Mr. Boyle, being in fact supposed to be \"boycotted\" for\r\nentertaining officers of the police. This \"boycott,\" however, has\r\nentailed no practical inconvenience upon us; and Mr. Boyle's pretty and\r\nplucky daughters, who manage his house for him, laughed scornfully at\r\nthe notion of being \"bothered\" by it.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon we took a car and drove out to Burtonport, on the Roads\r\nof Arranmore, to visit the parish priest there, Father Walker, and Mr.\r\nHammond, the agent of the Conyngham estates.\r\n\r\nWe passed near a large inland lake, Lough Meela, and the seaward views\r\nalong the coast were very fine. With peace and order this corner of\r\nIreland might easily become the chosen site of the most delightful\r\nseaside homes in the United Kingdom. The Recorder of Cork has discovered\r\nthis, and passes a great part of the year here. This Donegal coast is no\r\nfurther from the great centres of British wealth and population than are\r\nMount Desert and the other summer resorts of Maine and New Hampshire\r\nfrom New York and Philadelphia; and the islands which break the great\r\nroll of the Atlantic here cannot well be more nearly in \"a state of\r\nnature\" than were the Isles of Shoals, for example, in my college days,\r\nlong after Mr. Lowell first wandered there with the transcendental\r\nThaxters to celebrate the thunders of the surf at Appledore.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful granitic formations we had seen on the way from Gweedore\r\nstretch all along the coast to the Roads of Arranmore. At Burtonport\r\nthey lie on the very water's edge. At a place called Lickeena, masses of\r\nbeautiful salmon-and rose-coloured granite actually trend into the\r\ntidewater, and at Burtonport proper is a promontory of that\r\nrichly-mottled granite which I had supposed to be the peculiar heritage\r\nof Peterhead, and which is now largely exported from Scotland to the\r\nUnited States. Why should not this Irish granite be shipped directly\r\nfrom Donegal to America, there to be built up into cathedrals, and\r\nshaped into monuments for the Exiles of Erin? All these formations which\r\nwe have seen present themselves in great cubical blocks, so jointed that\r\nthey may be detached without blasting, with great comparative ease, and\r\nwith little of the waste which results from the squaring of shapeless\r\nmasses. At the same time, as we saw while coming from Gweedore, the\r\nmany lakes of this region offer all the water-power necessary for\r\npolishing-works, columnar lathes, and the general machinery used in\r\ndeveloping such quarries. Without being an expert in granites, I have\r\nseen enough of the granite works at home to feel quite sure that a\r\nmoderate and judiciously managed investment here ought to return a\r\nhandsome result. If the National League is as well off as it is reputed\r\nto be, it might go into this business open a new and remunerative\r\nindustry to the people of a \"congested\" district, and earn dividends\r\nlarge enough to enable it to pay the expenses of the war against England\r\nat Westminster, without drawing on the savings of the servant-girls in\r\nAmerica, The only person likely to suffer would be the \"Gombeen man,\" if\r\nthe peasantry earned enough to pay off their debts to him, and stop the\r\nflow of interest into his coffers.\r\n\r\nAt Burtonport we found the \"Gombeen man,\" of Dungloe, represented by a\r\nvery large \"store.\" He runs steamers between this place and various\r\nports on the Scottish and Irish coasts, bringing in goods and taking out\r\nthe crops which his debtors turn over to him.\r\n\r\nThis Burtonport \"store\" towers high above the modest home of the parish\r\npriest, Father Walker. To our great regret he was absent on parochial\r\nduty, but his niece very kindly welcomed us into his modest study, where\r\nwe left a note begging him to honour us with his company at dinner in\r\nDungloe.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond, too, was absent, so after paying our respects to his wife,\r\nwe drove back to Dungloe, and walked about the village till dark,\r\nchatting with the good-natured, civil people. The local sensation here\r\nthey tell us is not the trial of the priests at Dunfanaghy, but a \"row\"\r\nbreeding between the chief of the Sweeneys and one of his brethren over\r\nthe possession of Her Majesty's Post-office. It seems there is an\r\nofficial regulation or custom that the post-office once established in a\r\nparticular building shall not be moved thence without positive cause\r\nshown. The head of the Sweeneys, having completed his new and grand\r\nestablishment, wishes to move the post-office thither; but the brother\r\nto whom he confided the office in the older building, where he left it\r\nwhile making the change of his own business, now desires to keep the\r\noffice where it is, and, I suppose, to become postmaster himself![17] A\r\ntrivial matter enough, but not without edification for students of the\r\nactual situation in this most curious country.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o'clock Father Walker made his appearance--a fine-looking,\r\ndignified, most amiable man. He is a teetotaller, which we esteemed a\r\nstroke of good fortune, a bottle of port wine which we obtained, despite\r\nthe \"boycott,\" from the Gombeen shop, proving to be of such a quality\r\nthat it might have been concocted in the last century, expressly to\r\ndiscredit the Methuen treaty.\r\n\r\nFather Walker is the President of the National League branch.\r\n\r\nLike Father M'Fadden at Gweedore, he speaks of the landlords in this\r\npart of Donegal as really owning, not so much farms as residential\r\ngrounds for tenants who export their thews and sinews to Scotland and\r\nother countries, and live by that traffic mainly. It is a common\r\npractice here, he tells me, for the children, who are very sharp and\r\nbright, to be taken by their parents into Tyrone and other parts of the\r\nNorth, and put out to live with the people there, who prize them, and\r\npay very good wages. I asked him if he thought the official estimate I\r\nhad seen of the proportion of these \"migratory labourers\" to the whole\r\npopulation of Ulster, as about one-tenth of one per cent., an\r\nunder-statement. He thought it was an under-statement for this part of\r\nthe county of Donegal, but to be explained, perhaps, by the fact that so\r\nmuch of the migration is merely from one county into another, and not\r\nout of the kingdom. He agreed that the practice goes on upon a much more\r\nextensive scale in the County Mayo, where more than thirteen per cent,\r\nof all the adult male population are said to belong to the category of\r\nmigratory labourers. The Irish population of England seems to be\r\nrecruited at regular seasons in this way, very much as is the Albanian\r\npopulation of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nFather Walker was full of information about the granite quarries, and\r\nmuch interested in the prospect of their development. He told us that a\r\npractical engineer from Liverpool had, not long ago, been here seeking a\r\nlease of the quarries--or, in other words, of the quarrying rights over\r\nsixty or seventy miles of Donegal--from the agent of Lord Conyngham.\r\nThis engineer had come to Donegal on a sporting expedition last year,\r\nand gone back full of the capabilities of the granite region. Father\r\nWalker had been told by him that similar quarries also exist in the\r\nCounty Mayo at Belmullet, where preparations are now making, he thinks,\r\nto develop them, though on a smaller scale than would be both\r\npracticable and desirable here.\r\n\r\nIn Mayo, as in Donegal, labour must be plentiful enough, and the\r\ncomparatively unskilled labour required in such quarries would be\r\nparticularly abundant here. It would be a great thing, Father Walker\r\nthought, to introduce here the custom of a regular pay-day, and with it\r\ngradually habits of exactness and economy, not easily developed without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe gave me also, at my request, some valuable information as to the\r\nstipends of the Catholic clergy, and the sources from which they are\r\nderived. This subject has been agitated in the local press of this part\r\nof Ireland in connection with estimates of Father M'Fadden's income at\r\nGweedore, which Father M'Fadden declares, I believe, to be greatly\r\nexaggerated. Father Walker has been parish priest at Burtonport for\r\nabout nine years. In all that time the highest sum reached in one year\r\nby the stipend has been £560; this sum having to be divided between the\r\nparish priest, who received £280, and two curates receiving £140 each.\r\nThe annual stipend, however, has more than once fallen below £480, and\r\nFather Walker thinks £520 a fair average, giving £260 to the parish\r\npriest, and £130 each to his curates. Where there are only two priests\r\nin a parish, as is the case, for example, in each of the parishes of\r\nGweedore and Falcarragh, the parish priest receives two-thirds, and the\r\ncurate one-third of the stipend.\r\n\r\nThe sources of this stipend are various, and in speaking upon this point\r\nFather Walker desired me to note that he could only speak positively of\r\nthe rules of this particular diocese, as they do not cover in their\r\nentirety the usages of other provinces, or even of other dioceses in\r\nthis province of Ireland. One general and invariable rule indeed exists\r\nthroughout Ireland, which is that every parish priest is bound to offer\r\nthe Holy Sacrifice, _pro populo_, for the whole people, without fee or\r\nreward, on all Sundays and Holy Days, making in all some eighty-seven\r\ntimes a year.\r\n\r\nIn the diocese of Raphoe, to which Burtonport belongs, there are four\r\nrecognised methods by which the revenues of the priests are raised. The\r\nfirst is an annual fixed stipend of four shillings for each household or\r\nfamily. \"Sometimes,\" said Father Walker, \"but rarely, the better-off\r\nfamilies give more than this; and not unfrequently the poorer families\r\nfail to give anything under this head.\" The second is a fixed stipend of\r\none pound upon the occasion of a marriage. \"Sometimes, but not often,\r\nthis sum is exceeded by generous and prosperous parishioners.\" The third\r\nis a standard stipend of two shillings for a baptism. \"This also\r\nsuffers, but on rare occasions,\" said the good priest, \"a favourable\r\nexception. I mention the exceptions as well as the rules,\" said the good\r\nFather, \"in order to make grateful allusion to the donors.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last consists of the offerings at interments. \"These vary\r\nvery much indeed, but they constitute an important, and, I may say, a\r\nnecessary item in the incomes of the clergy.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these four forms of stipend, the priests derive a revenue from\r\n\"those who ask them to offer the Holy Sacrifice 'for their special\r\nintention.'\" In such cases it is customary to offer a sum, usually of\r\ntwo shillings, but sometimes of half-a-crown, which is intended both as\r\na remuneration for the priest, and to cover the cost of altar\r\nrequisites.\r\n\r\nFather Walker estimates the families in his own parish in round numbers\r\nat about thirteen hundred, and in Gweedore and Falcarragh at about nine\r\nhundred each. We had some conversation about the great fisheries, which\r\none would think ought to exist, but do not exist, on this coast, such\r\nfishing as is done here by the natives being on a very limited scale.\r\nFather Walker tells me that formerly £80,000 worth of herring were taken\r\non this coast, though he is not sure that Donegal fishermen took them.\r\nBut of late years he thinks the herring have deserted these waters. He\r\nadmits, however, that the people have no liking for the sea. \"Going over\r\nonce,\" he said, \"to Arranmore from the mainland in a boat with a priest\r\nof the country, the water was a little rough, and the poor man nearly\r\npinched a piece out of my arm holding on to me!\" Father Walker himself\r\nthought the trip across the \"sound\" to Tory Island rather a ticklish\r\npiece of business. Yet the natives make it sometimes in their little\r\ncorraghs or canvas boats, which would seem to show that some of them\r\nmust be capable of seamanship. Most of these islands, notably\r\nArranmore, Father Walker thought quite incapable of supporting the\r\npeople who dwell on them, without constant help from the mainland. Is it\r\nnot an open question whether an age which countenances the condemnation\r\nof private property in houses declared unfit for human habitation ought\r\nto hesitate at dealing in the same spirit with nurseries of chronic\r\npenury and intermittent famine? On one of these islands, known as Scull\r\nIsland, Father Walker tells me great quantities of human bones are found\r\nin circular graves or trenches, very shallow, and going all around the\r\nisland. There are legends of great battles fought on the little island,\r\nand of pestilences, to account for these. But it is likely enough that\r\nthe island was simply used as a cemetery by the dwellers on the shore at\r\nsome early date. Father Walker when he was last, there had brought away\r\nsome of these relics. One he showed us, the beautifully formed jawbone\r\nof a young child, apparently ten or twelve years old, with exquisite\r\npearly teeth. The chin was not in the least prognathous, but very well\r\nformed. In this district of Dungloe, too, the women weave and knit as\r\nwell as at Gweedore; and Father Walker, before he left us for his home,\r\nafter a most agreeable evening, promised to send me some specimens of\r\ntheir handiwork. He is sure that with a proper organisation this\r\nindustry might be so developed as to materially relieve the people here\r\nfrom the pressure of their debts to the dealers of all kinds, a pressure\r\nmuch more severe than that of the rent. According to the dealers\r\nthemselves, no tenant really in debt to them can now expect to work\r\nhimself free of the burden under four or five years. It is obvious how\r\nmuch power, political as well as social, is thus lodged in the hands of\r\nthe dealers, and especially of the \"Gombeen men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON'S COURT, _Wednesday, Feb. 8._--Since last night I have travelled\r\nfrom one extreme to the other of Irish life--from the desolation of the\r\nRosses of Donegal to the grandly wooded, picturesque, and beautiful\r\ndemesne of Baron's Court. We made an early start from Dungloe on a\r\ncapital car for Letterkenny, where we were to strike the railway for\r\nStrabane and Newtown-Stewart. The morning was clear, but cold. On\r\nleaving Dungloe we drove directly into a region of reclaimed land, where\r\nimprovements of various kinds seemed to be going on. All this our\r\njarvey informed us, with a knowing look, belonged to Mr. Sweeney.\r\n\r\n\"Was he a squire of this country?\" I asked innocently.\r\n\r\n\"A squire of this country, sorr? He is just Mr. Sweeney, the Gombeen\r\nman; he and his brothers, they all came here from where I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAn energetic man, certainly, Mr. Sweeney, and not likely, I should\r\nthink, to allow the National League, to push matters here to the point\r\nof nationalising the land of Donegal, if he can prevent it. In the\r\nhighway we met, two or three miles out of Dungloe, a very trim dainty\r\nlittle lady, in a long, well-fitting London waterproof ulster, with a\r\nnatty little umbrella in her hand, walking merrily towards the town. How\r\nweatherwise she was soon appeared, the rain coming up suddenly, and\r\ncoming down sharply, in the whirling way it has among the hills\r\neverywhere. The scenery was desolate, but grand. Countless little lochs\r\ngive sparkle and life to it. Everywhere the granite. About Doocharry, a\r\nromantic little spot, where Lord Cloncurry has a fishing-box in the\r\nheart of a glorious landscape, masses crop out of a rich red granite,\r\nfiner in colour than any we had previously seen. In that neighbourhood\r\nthe wastes of Donegal take on an aspect which recalls, though upon quite\r\na different key in colour, the inimitable beauty of those treeless\r\nNorth-western highlands of Scotland, upon which Nature has lavished all\r\nthe wealth of her palette. Vast spaces of brown and red and gold shimmer\r\naway under the softly luminous mountain atmosphere to the dark blues and\r\npurples of the hills. We passed Glen Veagh again, but from quite a\r\ndifferent point of view, which gave us a beautiful picture of Lough\r\nVeagh in its length, and of the smiling pastoral landscape upon its\r\nfurther shore.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the eastern boundary of Donegal, hedges and civilised\r\nagriculture reappeared. With these we came upon mud cottages, such as I\r\nhad not seen in Donegal, being the huts provided for their labourers by\r\nthe tenant-farmers, whose comfortable stone-houses and out-buildings\r\nstood well back under the long ranges of the hills.\r\n\r\nWe passed through much striking scenery, perhaps the finest point being\r\na magnificent Gap in the hills, guarded and defined by three colossal\r\nheadlands, one of them a vast long rampart, the other two gigantic\r\ncounterscarps. The immediate approach to Letterkenny, too, from the west\r\nis charming, passing in full view of the extensive and beautiful park\r\nand the large mansion of Colonel Stewart of the Guards, and skirting the\r\nwell-kept estate of Mr. Boyd, the owner of the ivy-clad cottages which\r\nso took my fancy the other day.\r\n\r\nIn the Ulster settlement under King James I. a patent for Letterkenny\r\nwas issued to one of the Crawfords. Then, as the records tell us, \"Sir\r\nGeorge Marburie dwelt there, and there were forty houses all inhabited\r\nby British tenants. A great market town, and standeth well for the\r\nKing's service.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we found a fair going on--this time attended by swarms of peddlers\r\nvending old clothes and all sorts of small wares, bread-cartmen, and\r\ntea-vendors. These latter aver that it is easier to sell tea in the\r\n\"congested\" districts at 4s. 6d. than at 2s. 6d. The people have no test\r\nof its quality but its price!\r\n\r\nThe town was gay with soldiers and police--whose advent had created such\r\na demand for bread and meat, a man told us, that all the butchers and\r\nbakers in Letterkenny and Dunfanaghy were at their wits' ends to meet\r\nit. \"But they don't complain of that!\" We reached Newtown-Stewart by\r\nrailway after dark. As we passed Sion the mills were all lighted up,\r\ngiving it the look of an English or New England town. A New England\r\nsnow-storm, too, awaited us at our journey's end; and, after a wild\r\ndrive of several miles through the whirling white mists, it was a\r\ndelectable thing to find ourselves welcomed in a hall full of light and\r\nwarmth and flowers by merry children and lively dogs, the guard of\r\nhonour of the most gracious and charming of hostesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON'S COURT, _Thursday, Feb. 9._--Among a batch of letters received\r\nthis morning I find one from a most estimable and accomplished priest in\r\nthe West of Ireland, to whom I wrote from Dublin announcing my intention\r\nof visiting the counties of Clare and Kerry. \"I shall be very glad,\" he\r\nsays, \"to learn that no evil hath befallen you during your visit to that\r\nsolitary plague-spot, where dwell the disgraceful and degraded\r\n'Moonlighters.' Would not 'martial law,' if applied to that particular\r\nspot, suffice to stamp out, these-insensate pests of society?\" This\r\nlanguage, strong, but not too strong in view of the hideous murder last\r\nweek near Lixnaw of a farmer in the presence of his daughter for the\r\natrocious crime of taking a farm \"boycotted\" by the National League,\r\nshows that the open alliance between this organisation and the criminal\r\nclasses in certain parts of Ireland is beginning (not a day too soon) to\r\narouse the better order of priests in Ireland to the peril of playing\r\nwith edged tools. For my correspondent is not only a priest, but a\r\nNationalist. I have sent him in reply a letter received by me, also\r\nto-day, touching the conduct in connection with the Lixnaw murder of a\r\npriest, a curate, I think, comparatively new to the place, who,\r\nstanding by the corpse of the murdered man, endeavoured, so my informant\r\nstates, to make his unfortunate daughter give up the names of the\r\nmurderers, the effect of which would have been to put them on their\r\nguard, and \"under the protection of that public conspiracy of silence,\r\nwhich is the shield of all such criminals in these parts!\" Baron's Court\r\nis a very large, stately mansion, lacking elevation perhaps like\r\nBlenheim, but imposing by its mass and the area it covers. It was\r\nrebuilt almost entirely by the late Duke of Abercorn, who also made\r\nimmense plantations here which cover the country for miles around. His\r\ngrandfather, the handsome Marquis of the days of the Prince Regent,\r\ncame here a great deal towards the end of his life, but did little\r\ntowards making the mansion worthy of its site. Two very good portraits\r\nof him here show that he deserved his reputation as the finest-looking\r\nman of his day, a reputation attested by a diamond ring, the history of\r\nwhich is still preserved in the family. A fine though irregular pearl\r\ngiven by Philip of Spain to his hapless spouse, Mary Tudor, is another\r\nof the heirlooms of Baron's Court; but the ring and the note left by\r\nMary Stuart to Claud Hamilton, Lord Paisley, mysteriously disappeared\r\nduring the long minority of the late Duke under the trusteeship of the\r\nfourth Earl of Aberdeen, and have since, it is said, come into the\r\npossession of the Duke of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nOf the three castles given to Lord Claud Hamilton by James I., to enable\r\nhim to hold this country, one which stood at Strabaue has disappeared,\r\nthe memory of it surviving only in the name of Castle Street in that\r\ntown. The ivy-clad ruins of another adorn a height in this beautiful\r\npark. They are \"bosomed high in tufted trees,\" and overlook one of three\r\nmost lovely lakes, stretching in a shining chain through the length of\r\nthe demesne.\r\n\r\nAnother ruined tower of the time of King John stands on an island in\r\none of these lakes. When the Ulster settlement was made, these lands\r\nwith all the countryside were held by the O'Kanes. With the other Celtic\r\nand Catholic inhabitants, they were driven by the masterful invaders\r\ninto the mountains and bogs. There still remain their descendants, still\r\nCeltic and still Catholic, and still dreaming of the day when they shall\r\ndescend into the low country and drive the Protestant Scotch and English\r\nfrom the \"fat lands\" which they occupy. In this way the racial and\r\nreligious animosities are kept alive, which have died out in Tipperary\r\nand Waterford, for example, where the Cromwellian English have become\r\nmore Irish and often more Catholic than the Irish themselves.\r\n\r\nI took a long drive and walk with Lord Ernest this afternoon through the\r\npark, which rivals Curraghmore in extent. It is nowhere divided from the\r\nlands of the adjoining tenants, and with great liberality is thrown open\r\nto the people, not only of Newtown-Stewart and Strabane, but of all the\r\ncountry. Parties, sometimes of seven hundred people, from Belfast come\r\ndown to pass the day in these sylvan solitudes, and it is to be recorded\r\nto the praise of Ireland that these visitors always behave with perfect\r\ngood sense and good feeling.\r\n\r\nThe \"terrible trippers\" of the English midlands, as I once heard an old\r\nverger in a northern Cathedral call them, who chip off relics from\r\nmonuments, pull up flowers by the roots, and scatter sandwich papers and\r\nempty gingerbeer bottles broadcast over well-rolled lawns, are not\r\nknown, Lord Ernest tells me, in this island. As he neatly puts it, the\r\nIrishman, no matter what his station in life may be, or how great a\r\nblackguard he may really be, always instinctively knows when he ought to\r\nbehave like a gentleman, and knows how to do so. In the lakes were\r\nhundreds of wild fowl. The sky was a sky of Constable--silvery-white\r\nclouds, floating athwart a dome of clear Italian blue. The soil here\r\nmust be extraordinarily fertile. The woods and groves are dense beyond\r\nbelief. Cut down what you like, the growth soon overtakes you, as lush\r\nalmost as in the tropics.\r\n\r\nThere was a great cyclone here a year or two ago, which prostrated in a\r\nnight over a hundred thousand trees. You see the dentated gaps left by\r\nthis disaster in the great circle of firs and birches on the surrounding\r\nhills, but they make hardly a serious break in the thoroughly sylvan\r\ncharacter of the landscape. We visited the centre of the devastation,\r\nwhere I found myself in what seemed to be a backwoods clearing in\r\nAmerica. An enterprising Scot, Kirkpatrick by name, has taken a contract\r\nunder the Duke, built himself a neat wooden cabin and stables, set up a\r\nsmall saw-mill driven by steam, and is hard at work turning the fallen\r\ntrees into timber, and making a very good thing of it, both for the Duke\r\nand for himself. He has one or two of his own people with him, but\r\nemploys the labour of the country, and has no fear of disturbance. He\r\nthinks, however, that he must get \"a good wicked dog\" to frighten away\r\nthe tramps, who sometimes stray into his woodland, and put the\r\nenterprise in peril by smoking and drowsing under haystacks.\r\n\r\nNear this clearing is a model village, the houses scrupulously neat,\r\nwith trees and flowers, and here we met the Duchess with her devoted dog\r\nwalking briskly along to visit one of her people, a wonderful old man,\r\nbearing the ancient name of the O'Kanes, and five years older than the\r\nKaiser William. Until six months ago this veteran was an active\r\ncarpenter, coming and going, about his work at ninety-six like a man in\r\nmiddle age. Then he went to bed with a bad cold, and will probably\r\nnever rise again. In all his life he never has touched meat or soup, and\r\nwhen they are now offered him rejects them angrily. He has lived, and\r\npreferred to live, entirely on oatmeal in the form of cakes and\r\nporridge, and on potatoes; so I make a present of him as a glorious\r\nexample to the vegetarians. As in so many other cases, his memory of\r\nrecent events is dim and clouded--of events long past, clear and\r\nphotographic: the negatives taken in youth quite perfect, the lenses\r\nwhich now take, dimmed and fractured.\r\n\r\nHe perfectly recollects, for example, the assembling here of the\r\nrecruits going out to the Continent before the battle of Waterloo, and\r\ncan give the names and describe the peculiarities of stalwart lads long\r\nsince crumbled into dust around Mont St. Jean. With the curious\r\nunconcern about death which marks his people, this expectant emigrant\r\ninto the unknown world chats about his departure as if it were for\r\nDublin, and his kinsfolk chat with him.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll be going soon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I shan't trouble ye more than an hour or two more.\"\r\n\r\nIn quite another part of the domain we came upon a Covenanter--a true,\r\nauthentic Covenanter, who might have walked out of _Old Mortality_; the\r\nname of him, Keyes. He greeted Lord Ernest cheerily enough, nodded to me\r\nin a not unfriendly way, and at once broke into exhortation: \"It's a\r\nvery short life we live; man that is born of woman is of few days, and\r\nfull of trouble. Well for them that are the children of light--if seeing\r\nthe light they sin not against it\"; and so on with amazing volubility.\r\n\r\nThere are eighty-five of these Covenanters here. They touch not nor have\r\ntouched the accursed thing. To them all parties and all governments are\r\nalike evil. The Whigs persecuted the Solemn League and Covenant--so did\r\nthe Tories. Nationalists and Unionists are to them alike abominable,\r\nsold under sin. Withal they are shrewd, canny, successful farmers--and,\r\nas I inferred from sundry incidents, before Lord Ernest confided the\r\nfact to me, not averse from a \"right gude williewaught\" now and then.\r\n\r\nMr. Keyes, I thought, was not a blue-ribbon man, nor a ribbon-man of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess told me afterwards she had vainly endeavoured more than once\r\nto get these people to vote at elections.\r\n\r\nWe had a sprinkling of such people, and very good people in quiet times\r\nthey were, in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, to whom\r\nFederals and Confederates were alike anathema.\r\n\r\nWe wound up our drive to-day just beyond \"the Duke's seat,\" a little\r\nrustic bench put up by the late Duke on a hill range which commands a\r\nmagnificent view over the whole domain of hill and forest and lakes, and\r\nfar away to the mountains of Munterlony. There, in the bogs and woods\r\nJames Hamilton, \"lord baron of Strabane,\" with \"other rebels, unknown,\r\nin his company,\" hid himself till, after the fall of Charlemont in\r\nAugust 1650, he was captured by a party of the Commonwealth's\r\nmen--whereby, as the record here runs, \"all and singular his manors,\r\ntowns, lands, and so forth were forfeited to the Commonwealth of\r\nEngland.\" Under this pressure he sought \"protection,\" and got it a\r\nfortnight later from Cromwell's General, Sir Charles Coote, whose\r\ndescendants still nourish in Wicklow. But on the 31st of December 1650\r\nhe \"broke the said protection, and joined himself with Sir Phelim\r\nO'Neill, being then in rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nTroublous times those, and a \"lord baron of Strabane\" needed almost the\r\nalacrity in turning his coat of a harlequin or a modern politician! It\r\nis a comfort to know that at last, on the 16th of June 1655, he found\r\nrest, dying at Ballyfathen, \"a Roman Catholic and a papist recusant.\" As\r\nwe came back into the gardens and grounds, Lord Ernest showed me,\r\nimbedded in the earth, a huge anchor presented to the present Duke by\r\nthe Corporation of Waterford, as having belonged to the French 28-gun\r\nfrigate, on which in 1689 James II. and Lord Abercorn sailed away from\r\nIreland for Prance. I believe that because of its weight the present\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty avers that it is no anchor at all, but a\r\nbuoy fixture. It might have been ten times as heavy, and yet not have\r\navailed to keep James from getting to sea at that particular time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON'S COURT, _Friday, Feb. 10._--Here also, in County Tyrone, the\r\nIrish women show their skill in women's work. Mrs. Dixon, the English\r\nwife of the house-steward of Baron's Court, has charge of a woollen\r\nindustry founded here, after a discourse on thrift, delivered at a\r\ntemperance meeting of the people by the then Marquis of Hamilton, had\r\nstirred the country up to consider whether the peasant women might not\r\npossibly find some better and more profitable way of passing their\r\nwinter evenings than in sitting huddled around a peat fire with their\r\nelbows on their knees, gossiping about their neighbours. Lord Hamilton\r\ncited the women of Gweedore as proofs that such a way might by searching\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess found the funds, the stewardess invested them in\r\nbuying the necessary yarn and knitting-needles, and the Marchioness of\r\nHamilton acted as corresponding clerk and business agent of the new\r\nindustry. The clothing department of the British army lent a listening\r\near to the business proposals made to it, and the work began. From that\r\ntime on it has been the main substantial resource against suffering and\r\nstarvation of the families of some three hundred labourers in the hill\r\ncountry near Baron's Court.\r\n\r\nThese labourers work for the small farmers from April to November; and\r\nbetween the autumn and the spring their wives and daughters knit, and by\r\nthe Baron's Court machinery are enabled to dispose of, nearly twenty\r\nthousand pairs of woollen socks. The yarns are brought from Edinburgh to\r\nthe store-house at Baron's Court. Thither every Wednesday come the\r\nknitters. Mrs. Dixon weighs the hanks of yarn, and gives them out.\r\n\r\nOn the following Wednesday the knitters reappear, each with her bale of\r\nstockings or socks. These are again weighed, and the knitters receive\r\ntheir pay according to the weight, quality, and size of the goods. In\r\nsome families there are four, five, or six knitters. All these people,\r\nwith four or five exceptions, are small cottars living on wretched\r\nlittle mountain farms, not on the Duke of Abercorn's property; and but\r\nfor this industry they would be absolutely without employment all the\r\nwinter through.\r\n\r\nSome of them come from a distance of twelve or fourteen miles, and but\r\nfor this resource would literally starve. They are nearly all of them\r\nCatholics, and the Protestants here being Unionists, they are probably\r\nNationalists. About three hundred knitters in all are employed. In the\r\nyear 1886-87 the orders given for Baron's Court work enabled Mrs. Dixon\r\nto pay out regularly about five pounds a week, not including casual\r\nprivate orders. For the current year the orders have been much larger,\r\nand the expenditure proportionally greater. Mrs. Dixon's storehouse was\r\nfull of goods to-day. The long knickerbocker stockings which she showed\r\nus were remarkably good, some in \"cross-gartered\" patterns, handsomer,\r\nI thought, than similar goods in the Scottish Highlands--and all of them\r\nstaunch and well-proportioned.\r\n\r\nFor socks such as are supplied to the volunteers and the troops the War\r\nOffice pays 8-3/4d. a pair.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to learn from Mrs. Dixon that these people thoroughly\r\nappreciate the spirit which prompted and still directs this enterprise.\r\nLast spring when the Duchess was thought for a time to be hopelessly\r\nill, a young girl came down to Baron's Court weeping bitterly. On her\r\narm was a basket, in which were two young chanticleers crowing lustily.\r\nThe poor girl said these were all she had, and she had brought them \"to\r\nmake soup for the Duchess, for she heard that was what the great people\r\nlived on, and it might save her life.\"\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I went over by the railway to Derry with Lord Ernest to\r\nattend a meeting there. The \"Maiden City\" stands picturesquely on the\r\nFoyle, and has a fine, though not large, cathedral of St. Colomb,\r\nrestored only last year, of which it may be noted that the work never\r\nwas undertaken while the Protestant Church of Ireland was established by\r\nlaw, and has been successfully carried out since the disendowment of\r\nthat Church. The streets were white with snow, but the meeting in the\r\nold Town Hall was largely attended. It was, in fact, a sort of Orange\r\nsymposium--tea being served at long tables, and the platform decorated\r\nwith a pianoforte. The Mayor of the city presided, and between the\r\nspeeches, songs, mostly in the Pyramus or condoling vein, were sung by a\r\nlocal tenor of renown. It was very like an American tea-fight in the\r\ncountry, and the audience were unquestionably enthusiastic. They quite\r\ncheered themselves hoarse when Lord Ernest Hamilton reminded them that\r\nhe had made his first political speech in that hall on a \"memorable\r\noccasion,\" when, being an as yet unfledged Parliamentarian, he had taken\r\na hand in a successful attempt to prevent the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr.\r\nDawson, from making a speech in Derry. One of my neighbours, a merchant\r\nin the city, told me that a project is afoot for tearing down the old\r\nhall in which we met \"to enlarge the street,\" but he added that \"the\r\npeople of Derry were too proud of their history to allow it!\"\r\n\r\nI understood him to say it is one of the very few buildings in Derry\r\nwhich witnessed the famous siege, and the breaking of the boom.\r\n\r\nWe left the \"revel\" early, caught a fast train to Newtown-Stewart, and\r\nreturned here an hour ago through a driving snowstorm, most dramatically\r\narranged to enhance the glow and genial charm of our welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON'S COURT, _Saturday, Feb. 11th._--All the world was white with snow\r\nthis morning. Alas! for the deluded birds we have been listening to for\r\ndays past; thrushes, larks, and as, I believe, blackbirds, though there\r\nis a tradition in these parts that no man ever heard the blackbird sing\r\nbefore the 15th of February. I suspect it grew out of the date of St.\r\nValentine's Day. We had some lovely music, however, within doors this\r\nmorning; and, in spite of the snow and the chill wind, a little fairy of\r\na girl, with her groom, went off like mad across country on her pony,\r\n\"Guinea Pig,\" to fetch the mails from Newtown-Stewart.\r\n\r\nNot long after breakfast came in from Letterkenny Sergeant Mahony of the\r\nconstabulary, on whose testimony Father M'Fadden was convicted. We had\r\nheard at Letterkenny that he was now on leave at Belfast, and Lord\r\nErnest had kindly arranged matters so that he should come here and\r\ntell us his story of Gweedore.\r\n\r\nAn admirable specimen he is of a most admirable body of men. He is as\r\nthoroughly Celtic in aspect as he is by name--a dark Celt, with a quiet\r\nresolute face, and a wiry well-built frame.\r\n\r\nNothing could be better than his manner and bearing, at once respectful\r\nand self-respectful: that manner of a natural gentleman one so often\r\nsees in the Irish peasant. He is a devout Catholic, but no admirer of\r\nFather M'Fadden.\r\n\r\nAs to his evidence, he explains very clearly that he was not sent to\r\nreport Father M'Fadden's speech at all, but to note and take down and\r\nreport language used in the speech of a sort to excite the people\r\nagainst the law. He was selected for this duty for three reasons: he is\r\na Donegal man who has lived at Gweedore for sixteen years; he is a fair\r\nstenographer; and he speaks Irish, in which language Father M'Fadden\r\nmade his speech.\r\n\r\n\"I speak Irish quite as well as he does,\" said the Sergeant quietly,\r\n\"and he knows I do. What I did was to put down in English words what I\r\nheard said in Irish. This I had to do because I have no stenographic\r\nsigns for the Irish words.\" He tells me he taught himself stenography.\r\n\r\n\"As for Father M'Fadden,\" he said, \"he told the people that' he was the\r\nlaw in Gweedore, and they should heed no other.' He spoke the truth,\r\ntoo, for he makes himself the law in Gweedore. He dislikes me because I\r\nam a living proof that he is not the only law in Gweedore!\" Of the\r\nbusiness shrewdness and ability of Father M'Fadden, Sergeant Mahony\r\nexpressed a very high opinion, though hardly in terms which would have\r\ngratified such an ecclesiastic as the late Cardinal Barnabo. Possibly\r\nCardinal Cullen might have relished them no better. \"Certainly he has\r\nthe finest house in Gweedore, sir, and what's more he made it the finest\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that he built it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, indeed; and did you not notice the beautiful stone fences he is\r\nputting up all about it, and the four farms he has?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is certainly a man of substance?\"\r\n\r\n\"And of good substance, sir! The Government, they gave him a hundred\r\npounds towards the house. But it was the flood that was the blessed\r\nthing for him and made a great man of him!\"\r\n\r\n\"The flood?\" I asked, with some natural astonishment; \"the flood? What\r\nflood?\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you never hear of the great flood of Gweedore? It was in\r\nAugust 1880. You will mind the water that comes down behind the chapel?\r\nWell, there was a flood, and it swelled, and it swelled, and it burst\r\nthe small pipe there behind the chapel: too small it was entirely for\r\ncarrying off' the great water, and nobody took notice of it, or that\r\nthere was anything wrong, and so the water was piled up behind the\r\nchapel, and at Mass on the Sunday, while the chapel was full, the walls\r\ngave way, and the water rushed in, and was nine feet deep. There were\r\nfive people that couldn't get out in time, and were drowned--two old\r\npeople and three children, young people. It was a great flood. And\r\nFather M'Fadden wrote about it--oh, he is a clever priest with the\r\npen--and they made a great subscription in London for the poor people\r\nand the chapel. I can't rightly say how much, but it was in the papers,\r\na matter of seven hundred pounds, I have heard say. And it was all sent\r\nto Father M'Fadden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it was spent, of course,\" I said, \"on the repairs of the chapel, or\r\ngiven to the relatives of the poor people who were drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no doubt; very likely it was, sir! But the repairs of the\r\nchapel--there isn't a mason in Donegal but will tell you a hundred\r\npounds would not be wanted to make the chapel as good as it ever was.\r\nAnd for the people that were drowned--two of them were old people, as I\r\nsaid to you, sir, that had no kith or kin to be relieved, and for the\r\nothers they were of well-to-do people that would not wish to take\r\nanything from the parish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was done with it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that I can't tell ye. It was spent for the people some way. You\r\nmust ask Father M'Fadden. He is the fund in Gweedore, just as he is the\r\nlaw in Gweedore. Oh! they came from all parts to see the great ruin of\r\nthe flood at Gweedore. They did, indeed. And some of them, it was poor\r\nsight they had; they couldn't see the big rift in the walls, when Father\r\nM'Fadden pointed it out to them. 'Whisht! there it is!' he would say,\r\npointing with his finger. Then they saw it!\"\r\n\r\nI asked him at what figure he put the income of Father M'Fadden from his\r\nparish. Without a moment's hesitation he answered, \"It's over a thousand\r\npounds a year, sir, and nearer twelve hundred than eleven.\" I expressed\r\nmy surprise at this, the whole rental of Captain Hill, the landlord,\r\nfalling, as I had understood, below rather than above £700 a year; and\r\nGweedore, as Father Walker had told me, containing fewer houses than\r\nBurtonport.\r\n\r\n\"Fewer houses, mayhap,\" said the sergeant, \"though I'm not sure of that;\r\nbut if fewer they pay more. There's but one curate--poor man, he does\r\nall the parish work, barring the high masses, and a good man he is, but\r\nhe gets £400 a year, and that is but a third of the income!\"\r\n\r\nI asked by what special stipends the priest's income at Gweedore could\r\nbe thus enhanced. \"Oh, it's mainly the funeral-money that helps it up,\"\r\nhe replied. \"You see, sir, since Father M'Fadden came to Gweedore it's\r\ncome to be the fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fashion?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, the fashion. This is the way it is, you see. When a poor\r\ncreature comes to be buried--no matter who it is, a pauper, or a tenant,\r\nor any one--the people all go to the chapel; and every man he walks up\r\nand lays his offering for the priest on the coffin; and the others, they\r\nwatch him. And, you see, if a man that thinks a good deal of himself\r\nwalks up and puts down five shillings, why, another man that thinks less\r\nof him, and more of himself, he'll go up and make it a gold ten-shilling\r\npiece, or perhaps even a sovereign! I've known Father M'Fadden, sir, to\r\ntake in as much as £15 in a week in that way.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Mahony told us a curious tale, too, of the way in which Father\r\nM'Fadden dealt with the people of the neighbouring parish of Falcarragh.\r\nHe would go down to the parish boundary, if he wanted to address the\r\npeople of Falcarragh, and stand over the line, with one foot in each\r\nparish!\r\n\r\nAt our request Sergeant Mahony made some remarks in Irish; very wooing\r\nand winning they were in sound. Before he left Baron's Court he promised\r\nto make out and send me a schedule of the parochial income at Gweedore,\r\nunder the separate heads of the sources whence it is derived.\r\n\r\nObviously Sergeant Mahony would make a good \"devil's advocate\" at the\r\ncanonization of Father M'Fadden. But, all allowances made for this, one\r\nthing would seem to be tolerably clear. Of the three personages who take\r\ntribute of the people of Gweedore, the law intervenes in their behalf\r\nwith only one--the landlord. The priest and the \"Gombeen man\" deal with\r\nthem on the old principle of \"freedom of contract.\" But it is by no\r\nmeans so clear which of the three exacts and receives the greatest\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nWe leave Baron's Court in an hour for Dublin, whence I go on alone\r\nto-night into Queen's County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nABBEYLEIX, _Sunday, Feb. 12._--Newtown-Stewart, through which I drove\r\nyesterday afternoon with Lord Ernest to the train, is a prettily\r\nsituated town, with the ruins of a castle in which James II. slept for a\r\nnight on his flight to France. He was cordially received, and by way of\r\nshowing his satisfaction left the little town in flames when he\r\ndeparted. Here appears to be a case, not of rack-renting, but of\r\nabsenteeism. The town belongs to a landlord who lives in Paris, and\r\nrarely, if ever, comes here. There are no improvements--no\r\nsanitation--but the inhabitants make no complaint. \"Absenteeism\" has its\r\ncompensations as well as its disadvantages. They pay low rents, and are\r\nlittle troubled; the landlord drawing, perhaps, £400 a year from the\r\nwhole place. The houses are small, though neat enough in appearance, but\r\nthe town has a sleepy, inert look. On the railway between Dundalk and\r\nNewry, we passed a spot known by the ominous name of \"The Hill of the\r\nSeven Murders,\" seven agents having been murdered there since 1840! I\r\nsuppose this must be set down to the force of habit. At Newry a cavalry\r\nofficer whom Lord Ernest knew got into our carriage. He was full of\r\nhunting, and mentioned a place to which he was going as a \"very fine\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the point of view of the picturesque?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no! from the point of view of falling off your horse!\"\r\n\r\nAt Maple's Hotel I found a most hospitable telegram, insisting that I\r\nshould give up my intention of spending the night at Maryborough, and\r\ncome on to this lovely place in my host's carriage, which would be sent\r\nto meet me at that station. I left Kingsbridge Station in Dublin about 7\r\nP.M. We had rather a long train, and I observed a number of people\r\ntalking together about one of the carriages before we started; but there\r\nwas no crowd at all, and nothing to attract special attention. As we\r\nmoved out of the station, some lads at the end of the platform set up a\r\ncheer. We ran on quietly till we reached Kildare. There quite a\r\ngathering awaited our arrival on the platform, and as we slowed up, a\r\ncry went up from among them of, \"Hurrah for Mooney! hurrah for Mooney!\"\r\nThe train stopped just as this cry swelled most loudly, when to my\r\nsurprise a tall man in the gathering caught one or two of the people by\r\nthe shoulder, shaking them, and called out loudly, \"Hurrah for\r\nGilhooly--you fools, hurrah for Gilhooly!\"\r\n\r\nThis morning I learned that I had the honour, unwittingly, of travelling\r\nfrom Dublin to Maryborough with Mr. Gilhooly, M.P., who appears to have\r\nbeen arrested in London on Friday, brought over yesterday by the day\r\ntrain, and sent on at once from Dublin to his destined dungeon.\r\n\r\nAn hour's drive through a rolling country, showing white and weird under\r\nits blanket of snow in the night, brought us to this large, rambling,\r\ndelightful house, the residence of Viscount de Vesci. Mr. Gladstone came\r\nhere from Lord Meath's on his one visit to Ireland some years ago. I\r\nfind the house full of agreeable and interesting people; and the chill\r\nof the drive soon vanished under the genial influences of a light\r\nsupper, and of pleasant chat in the smoking-room. A good story was told\r\nthere, by the way, of Archbishop Walsh, who being rather indiscreetly\r\nimportuned to put his autograph on a fan of a certain Conservative lady\r\nwell known in London, and not a little addicted to lion-hunting,\r\nperemptorily refused, saying, \"no, nor any of the likes of her!\" And\r\nanother of Father Nolan, a well-known priest, who died at the age of\r\nninety-seven. When someone remonstrated with him on his association with\r\nan avowed unbeliever in Christianity, like Mr. Morley, Father Nolan\r\nreplied, \"Oh, faith will come with time!\" The same excellent priest,\r\nwhen he came to call on Mr. Gladstone, here at Abbeyleix, on his arrival\r\nfrom the Earl of Meath's, pathetically and patriarchally adjured him, on\r\nhis next visit to Ireland, \"not to go from one lord's house to another,\r\nbut to stay with the people.\" This was better than the Irish journal\r\nwhich, finding itself obliged to chronicle the fact that Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwith his wife and daughter, was visiting Abbeyleix, gracefully observed\r\nthat he \"had been entrapped into going there!\" Some one lamenting the\r\nlack of Irish humour and spirit in the present Nationalist movement, as\r\ncompared with the earlier movements, Lord de Vesci cited as a solitary\r\nbut refreshing instance of it, the incident which occurred the other day\r\nat an eviction in Kerry,[18] of a patriotic priest who chained himself\r\nto a door, and put it across the entrance of the cabin to keep out the\r\nbailiffs!\r\n\r\nIt is discouraging to know that this delightful act was bitterly\r\ndenounced by some worthy and well-meaning Tory in Parliament as an\r\n\"outrage\"!\r\n\r\nDespite the snow the air this morning, in this beautiful region, is soft\r\nand almost warm, and all the birds are singing again. The park borders\r\nupon and opens into the pretty town of Abbeyleix, the broad and\r\npicturesque main thoroughfare of which, rather a rural road than a\r\nstreet, is adorned with a fountain and cross, erected in memory of the\r\nlate Lord de Vesci. There is a good Catholic chapel here (the ancient\r\nabbey which gave the place its name stood in the grounds of the present\r\nmansion), and a very handsome Protestant Church.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that two of the men implicated in the Phoenix Park\r\nmurders had been employed, one, I believe, as a mason, and one as a\r\ncarver, in the construction of this church. Both the chapel and the\r\nchurch to-day were well attended. I am told there has been little real\r\ntrouble here, nor has the Plan of Campaign been adopted here. Sometimes\r\nLord de Vesci finds threatening images of coffins and guns scratched in\r\nthe soil, with portraits indicating his agent or himself; but these mean\r\nlittle or nothing. Lady de Vesci, who loves her Irish home, and has done\r\nand is doing a good deal for the people here, tells me, as an amusing\r\nillustration of the sort of terrorism formerly established by the local\r\norganisations, that when she met two of the labourers on the place\r\ntogether, they used to pretend to be very busy and not to see her. But\r\nif she met one alone, he greeted her just as respectfully as ever.\r\n\r\nThe women here do a great deal of embroidery and lace work, in which she\r\nencourages them, but this industry has suffered what can only be a\r\ntemporary check, from the change of fashion in regard to the wearing of\r\nlaces. Why the loveliest of all fabrics made for the adornment of women\r\nshould ever go \"out of fashion\" would be amazing if anything in the\r\nvagaries of that occult and omnipotent influence could be. The Irish\r\nladies ought to circulate Madame de Piavigny's exquisite _Lime\r\nd'Heures_, with its incomparable illustrations by Carot and Meaulle,\r\ndrawn from the lace work of all ages and countries, as a tonic against\r\ndespair in respect to this industry. In one of the large rooms of her\r\nown house, Lady de Vesci has established and superintends a school of\r\ncarving for the children of poor tenants. It has proved a school of\r\ncivilisation also. The lads show a remarkable aptitude for the arts of\r\ndesign, and of their own accord make themselves neat and trim as soon as\r\nthey begin to understand what it is they are doing. They are always busy\r\nat home with their drawings and their blocks, and some of them are\r\nalready beginning to earn money by their work.\r\n\r\nWhat I have seen at Adare Manor near Limerick, where the late Earl of\r\nDunraven educated all the workmen employed on that mansion as\r\nstone-cutters and carvers, suffices to show that the people of this\r\ncountry have not lost the aptitudes of which we see so many proofs in\r\nthe relics of early Irish art.\r\n\r\nAmong the guests in the house is a distinguished officer, Colonel\r\nTalbot, who saw hard service in Egypt, and in the advance on Khartoum,\r\nwith camels across the desert--a marvellous piece of military work. I\r\nfind that he was in America in 1864-65, with Meade and Hunt and Grant\r\nbefore Petersburg, being in fact the only foreign officer then present.\r\nHe there formed what seem to me very sound and just views as to the\r\nability of the Federal commanders in that closing campaign of the Civil\r\nWar, and spoke of Hunt particularly with much admiration. Of General\r\nGrant he told me a story so illustrative of the simplicity and modesty\r\nwhich were a keynote in his character that I must note it. The day\r\nbefore the evacuation of Petersburg by the Con federates, Grant was\r\nurged to order an attack upon the Confederate positions. He refused to\r\ndo so. The next day the Confederates were seen hastily abandoning them.\r\nGrant watched them quietly for a while, and then putting down his glass,\r\nsaid to one of the officers who had urged the assault, \"You were right,\r\nand I was wrong. I ought to have attacked them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is provoking to know that the notes taken by this British officer at\r\nthat time, being sent through the Post Office by him some years ago to\r\nEdinburgh for publication, were lost in the transmission, and have never\r\nbeen recovered. Curiously enough, however, he thinks he has now and then\r\ndiscerned indications in articles upon the American War, published in a\r\nnewspaper which he named, going to show that his manuscripts are in\r\nexistence somewhere.\r\n\r\nABBEYLEIX, _Monday, Feb. 13._--To-day, in company with Lord de Vesci\r\nand a lady, I went over to Kilkenny. We left and arrived in a snowstorm,\r\nbut the trip was most interesting. Kilkenny, chiefly known in America, I\r\nfear, as the city of the cats, is a very picturesque place, thanks to\r\nits turrets and towers. It has two cathedrals, a Bound Tower (one of\r\nthese in Dublin was demolished in the last century!), a Town Hall with a\r\nbelfry, and looming square and high above the town, the Norman keep of\r\nits castle. The snow enlivened rather than diminished the scenic effect\r\nof the place. Bits of old architecture here and there give character to\r\nthe otherwise commonplace streets. Notable on the way to the castle is a\r\nbit of mediaeval wall with Gothic windows, and fretted with the\r\nscutcheon in stone of the O'Sheas. The connection of a gentleman of this\r\nfamily with the secret as well as the public story of the Parnellite\r\nmovement may one day make what Horace Greeley used to call \"mighty\r\ninterestin' reading.\" A dealer in spirits now occupies what is left of\r\nthe old Parliament House of Kilkenny, in which the rival partisans of\r\nPreston and O'Neill outfought the legendary cats, to the final ruin of\r\nthe cause of the Irish confederates, and the despair of the loyal\r\nlegate of Pope Innocent.\r\n\r\nOf Kilkenny Castle, founded by Strongbow, but two or three towers\r\nremain. The great quadrangle was rebuilt in 1825, and much of it again\r\nso late as in 1860. There is little, therefore, to recall the image of\r\nthe great Marquis who, if Rinuccini read him aright, played so\r\nresolutely here two centuries and a half ago for the stakes which Edward\r\nBruce won and lost at Dundalk. The castle of the Butlers is now really a\r\ngreat modern house.\r\n\r\nThe town crowds too closely upon it, but the position is superb. The\r\ncastle windows look clown upon the Nore, spanned by a narrow ancient\r\nbridge, and command, not only all that is worth seeing in the town, but\r\na wide and glorious prospect over a region which is even now beautiful,\r\nand in summer must be charming.\r\n\r\nOver the ancient bridge the enterprise of a modern brewer last week\r\nbrought a huge iron vat, so menacingly ponderous that the authorities\r\nmade him insure the bridge for a day.\r\n\r\nWithin the castle, near the main entrance, are displayed some\r\ntapestries, which are hardly shown to due advantage in that position.\r\nThey were made here at Kilkenny in a factory established by Piers\r\nButler, Earl of Ormonde, in the sixteenth century, and they ought to be\r\nsent to the Irish Exhibition of this year in London, as proving what\r\nIrish art and industry well directed could then achieve. They are\r\nequally bold in design and rich in colour. The blues are especially\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nThe grand gallery of the castle, the finest in the kingdom, though a\r\ntrifle narrow for its length, is hung with pictures and family\r\nportraits. One of the most interesting of these is a portrait of the\r\nblack Earl of Ormon'de, a handsome swarthy man, evidently careful of his\r\nperson, who was led by that political flirt, Queen Elizabeth, to believe\r\nthat she meant to make him a visit in Ireland, and, perhaps, to honour\r\nhim with her hand. He went to great expenses thereupon. At a parley with\r\nhis kinsman, the Irish chieftain O'Moore of Abbeyleix, this black earl\r\nwas traitorously captured, and an ancient drawing representing this\r\nevent hangs beneath his portrait.\r\n\r\nThe muniment room, where, thanks to Lord Ormonde's courtesy, we found\r\neverything prepared to receive us, is a large, airy, and fire-proof\r\nchamber, with well-arranged shelves and tables for consulting the\r\nrecords. These go back to the early Norrnan days, long before Edward\r\nIII. made James Butler Earl of Ormonde, upon his marriage with Alianore\r\nof England, granddaughter of Edward I. The Butlers came into Ireland\r\nwith Henry II., and John gave them estates, the charters of some of\r\nwhich, with the seals annexed, are here preserved. There are fine\r\nspecimens of the great seals also of Henry III., and of his sons Edward\r\nI. and Edmund Crouchback, and of the Tudor sovereigns, as well as many\r\nprivate seals of great interest. The wax of the early seals was\r\nobviously stronger and better than the wax since used. Of Elizabeth, who\r\ncame of the Butler blood through her mother, one large seal in yellow\r\nwax, attached to a charter dated Oct. 24, 1565, is remarkable for the\r\nbeauty of the die. The Queen sits on the obverse under a canopy; on the\r\nreverse she rides in state on a pacing steed as in her effigy at the\r\nTower of London. The seals of James I. follow the design of this die.\r\nTwo of these are particularly fine. At the Restoration something\r\ndisappears of the old stateliness. A seal of Charles II., of 1660, very\r\nlarge and florid in style, shows the monarch sitting very much at his\r\nease, with one knee thrown negligently over the other. Many of the\r\nprivate letters and papers of the seventeenth and early eighteenth\r\ncenturies, during which Kilkenny, as it had been often before, was a\r\ngreat centre of Irish politics and intrigues, have been bound up in\r\nvolumes, and the collection has been freely drawn upon by historians.\r\nBut it would obviously bear and reward a more thorough co-ordination and\r\nexamination than it has ever yet received.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious Table Book here preserved of Charles I. while at\r\nOxford in 1644, from which it appears that while the colleges were\r\nmelting up their plate for the King, his Majesty fared better than might\r\nhave been expected. His table was served with sixty pounds of mutton a\r\nday; and he wound up his dinner regularly with \"sparaguss\" so long as it\r\nlasted, and after it went out with artichokes.\r\n\r\nAn Expense Book, too, of the great Marquis, after he became the first\r\nDuke of Ormonde, Colonel Blood's Duke, kept at Kilkenny in 1668 throws\r\nsome interesting light on the cost of living and the customs of great\r\nhouses at that time. The Duke, who was in some respects the greatest\r\npersonage in the realm, kept up his state here at a weekly cost of\r\nabout £50, a good deal less--allowing for the fall in the power of the\r\npound sterling--than it would now cost him to live at a fashionable\r\nLondon hotel. He paid £9, 10s. a week for the keep of nineteen horses,\r\n18 shillings board wages for three laundry-maids, and £1, 17s. 4d. for\r\nseven dozen of tallow-candles. The wines served at the ducal table were\r\nBurgundy, Bordeaux, \"Shampane,\" Canary, \"Renish,\" and Portaport, the\r\nlast named at a shilling a bottle, while he paid no more than £3, 18s.\r\nfor six dozen bottles of Bordeaux, and £1, 1s. for a dozen and a half of\r\n\"Shampane.\" This of course was not the sparkling beverage which in our\r\ntimes is the only contribution of Champagne to the wine markets of the\r\nworld, for the _Ay Mousseux_ first appears in history at the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century. It was the red wine of Champagne, which so\r\nlong contested the palm with the vintages of Burgundy. St. Evremond, who\r\nwith the Comte d'Olonne and the great _gourmets_ of the seventeenth\r\ncentury thought Champagne the best, as the Faculty of Paris also\r\npronounced it the most wholesome of wines, doubtless introduced his own\r\nreligion on the subject into England--but the entry in the Duke's\r\nExpense Book of 1668 is an interesting proof that the duel of the\r\nvintages was even then going as it finally went in favour of Burgundy.\r\nWhile the Duke got his Champagne for 1s. 2d. a bottle, he had to pay\r\ntwenty shillings a dozen, or 1s. 8d. a bottle, for five dozen of\r\nBurgundy. He got his wines from Dublin, which then, as long before, was\r\nthe most noted wine mart of Britain. The English princes drew their best\r\nsupplies thence in the time of Richard II.\r\n\r\nFrom the castle we drove through the snow to the Cathedral of St.\r\nCanice, a grand and simple Norman edifice of the twelfth century, now\r\nthe Church of the Protestant bishop. An ancient Round Tower of much\r\nearlier date stands beside it like a campanile, nearly a hundred feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that Rinuccini wanted to buy and carry away one of the\r\ngreat windows of this Cathedral, in which mass was celebrated while he\r\nwas here. The Cathedral contains some interesting monuments of the\r\nButlers, and there are many curiously channelled burial slabs in the\r\nfloor, like some still preserved in the ruins of Abbeyleix. Lord de\r\nVesci pointed out to me several tombs of families of English origin once\r\npowerful here, but now sunk into the farmer class. On one of these I\r\nthink it was that we saw a remarkably well-preserved effigy of a lady,\r\nwearing a plaited cap under a \"Waterford cloak\"--one of the neatest\r\nvarieties of the Irish women's cloak--garment so picturesque at once,\r\nand so well adapted to the climate, that I am not surprised to learn\r\nfrom Lady de Vesci that it is very fast going out of fashion. This\r\nmorning before we left Abbeyleix she showed us two such cloaks, types\r\nfrom two different provinces, each in its way admirable. Put on and worn\r\nabout the room by two singularly stately and graceful ladies, they fell\r\ninto lines and folds which recalled the most exquisitely beautiful\r\nstatuettes of Tanagra; and all allowance made for the glamour lent them\r\nby these two \"daughters of the gods, divinely tall,\" it was impossible\r\nnot to see that no woman could possibly look commonplace and\r\ninsignificant in such a garment. Yet Lady de Vesci says that more than\r\nonce she has known peasant women, to whom such cloaks had been\r\npresented, cut off the characteristic and useful hood, and trim the\r\nmangled robe with tawdry lace. So it is all over the world! Women who\r\nare models for an artist when they wear some garment indigenous to their\r\ncountry and appropriate to its conditions, prefer to make guys of\r\nthemselves in grotesque travesties of the latest \"styles\" from London\r\nand Paris and Dublin!\r\n\r\nKilkenny boasts that its streets are paved with marble. It is in fact\r\nlimestone, but none the worse for that. The snow did not improve them.\r\nSo without going on a pilgrimage to the Kilkenny College, at which\r\nSwift, Congreve, and Farquhar,--an odd concatenation of\r\ncelebrities--were more or less educated, we made our way to the Imperial\r\nHotel for luncheon. The waiter was a delightful Celt. Upon my asking him\r\nwhether the house could furnish anything distantly resembling good Irish\r\nwhisky, he produced a bottle of alleged Scotch whisky, which he put upon\r\nthe table with a decisive air, exclaiming, \"And this, yer honour, is the\r\nmost excellent whisky in the whole world, or I'm not an Irishman!\"\r\n\r\nUrged by the cold we tempered it with hot water and tasted it. It shut\r\nus up at once to believe the waiter a Calmuck or a Portuguese--anything,\r\nin short, but an Irishman. It is an extraordinary fact that, so far, the\r\nwhisky I have found at Irish hotels has been uniformly quite execrable.\r\nI am almost tempted to think that the priests sequestrate all the good\r\nwhisky in order to discourage the public abuse of it, for the \"wine of\r\nthe country\" which they offer one is as uniformly excellent.\r\n\r\nKilkenny ought to be and long was a prosperous town. In 1702, the second\r\nDuke of Ormonde made grants (at almost nominal ground-rents) of the\r\nground upon which a large portion of the city of Kilkenny was then\r\nstanding, or upon which houses have since been built.\r\n\r\nThese grants have passed from hand to hand, and form the \"root of title\"\r\nof very many owners of house property in Kilkenny. The city is the\r\ncentre of an extensive agricultural region, famous, according to an\r\nancient ditty, for \"fire without smoke, air without fog, water without\r\nmud, and land without bog\"; but of late it has been undeniably\r\ndeclining. For this there are many reasons. The railways and the\r\nparcel-post diminish its importance as a local emporium. The almost\r\ncomplete disappearance of the woollen manufacture, the agricultural\r\ndepression which has made the banks and wholesale houses \"come down\"\r\nupon the small dealers, and the \"agitation,\" bankrupting or exiling the\r\nlocal gentry, have all conspired to the same result.\r\n\r\nFrom Abbeyleix station we walked back to the house through the park\r\nunder trees beautifully silvered with the snow. At dinner the party was\r\njoined by several residents of the county. One of them gave me his views\r\nof the working of the \"Plan of Campaign.\" It is a plan, he maintains,\r\nnot of defence as against unjust and exacting landlords, but of offence\r\nagainst \"landlordism,\" not really promoted, as it appears to be, in the\r\ninterest of the tenants to whose cupidity it appeals, but worked from\r\nDublin as a battering engine against law and order in Ireland. Every\r\ncase in which it is applied needs, he thinks, to be looked into on its\r\nown merits. It will then be found precisely why this or that spot has\r\nbees selected by the League for attack. At Luggacurren, for instance,\r\nthe \"Plan of Campaign\" has been imposed upon the tenants because the\r\nproperty belongs to the Marquis of Lansdowne, who happens to be\r\nGovernor-General of Canada, so that to attack him is to attack the\r\nGovernment. The rents of the Lansdowne property at Luggacurren, this\r\ngentleman offers to prove to me, are not and never have been excessive;\r\nand Lord Lansdowne has expended very large sums on improving the\r\nproperty, and for the benefit of the tenants. Two of the largest\r\ntenants having got into difficulties through reckless racing and other\r\nforms of extravagance found it convenient to invite the league into\r\nLuggacurren, and compel other tenants in less embarrassed circumstances\r\nto sacrifice their holdings by refusing to pay rents which they knew to\r\nbe fair, and were abundantly able and eager to pay. At Mitchelstown the\r\n\"Plan of Campaign\" was aimed again, not at the Countess of Kingston, the\r\nowner, but at the Disestablished Protestant Church of Ireland, the\r\ntrustees of which hold a mortgage of a quarter of a million sterling on\r\nthe estates. On the Clanricarde property in Galway the \"Plan of\r\nCampaign\" has been introduced, my informant says, because Lord\r\nClanricarde happens to be personally unpopular. \"Go down to Portumna and\r\nWoodford,\" he said, \"and look into the matter for yourself. You will\r\nfind that the rents on the Clanricarde estates are in the main\r\nexceptionally fair, and even low. The present Marquis has almost never\r\nvisited Ireland, I believe, and he is not much known even in London.\r\nPeople who dislike him for one reason or another readily believe\r\nanything that is said to his disadvantage as a landlord. Most people who\r\ndon't like the cut of Dr. Fell's whiskers, or the way in which he takes\r\nsoup, are quite disposed to listen to you if you tell them he beats his\r\nwife or plays cards too well. The campaigners are shrewd fellows, and\r\nthey know this, so they start the 'Plan of Campaign' on the Portumna\r\nproperties, and get a lot of English windbags to come there and hobnob\r\nwith some of the most mischievous and pestilent parish priests in all\r\nIreland--and then you have the dreadful story of the 'evictions,' and\r\nall the rest of it. Lord Clanricarde, or his agent, or both of them,\r\ngetting out of temper, will sit down and do some hasty or crabbed or\r\ninjudicious thing, or write a provoking letter, and forthwith it is\r\nenough to say 'Clanricarde,' and all common sense goes out of the\r\nquestion, to the great damage, not so much of Lord Clanricarde--for he\r\nlives in London, and is a rich man, and, I suppose, don't mind the\r\nrow--but of landlords all over Ireland, and therefore, in the long-run,\r\nof the tenants of Ireland as well.\"\r\n\r\nAt Luggacurren, this gentleman thinks, the League is beaten. There are\r\neighty-two tenants there, evicted and living dismally in what is called\r\nthe Land League village, a set of huts erected near the roadside, while\r\ntheir farms are carried on for the owner by the Land Corporation. As\r\nthey were most of them unwilling to accept the Plan, and were\r\nintimidated into it for the benefit of the League, and of the two chief\r\ntenants, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Kilbride, men of substance who had squandered\r\ntheir resources, the majority of the evicted are sore and angry.\r\n\r\n\"At first each man was allowed £3 a month by the League for himself and\r\nhis family. But they found that Mr. Kilbride, who has been put into\r\nParliament by Mr. Parnell for Kerry, a county with which he has no more\r\nto do than I have with the Isle of Skye, was getting £5 a week, and so\r\nthey revolted, and threatened to bolt if their subsidy was not raised to\r\n£4 a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this they get now? Out of what funds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the League funds, or, in other words, out of their own and other\r\npeople's money, foolishly put by the tenants into the keeping of the\r\nLeague to 'protect' it! They give it the kind of 'protection' that\r\nOliver gave the liberties of England: once they get hold of it, they\r\nnever let go!\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that at Gweedore Father M'Fadden had paid over to Captain\r\nHill the funds confided to him.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt; but there the landlord gave in, and the more fool he!\"\r\n\r\nWith another guest I had an interesting conversation about the Ulster\r\ntenant-right, which got itself more or less enacted into British law\r\nonly in 1870, and of which Mr. Froude tells me he sought in vain to\r\ndiscover the definite origin. \"The best lawyers in Ireland\" could give\r\nhim no light on this point. He could only find that it did not exist\r\napparently in 1770, but did exist apparently twenty years later. The\r\ngentleman with whom I talked to-night tells me that the custom of Ulster\r\nwas really once general throughout Ireland, and is called the \"Ulster\"\r\ncustom, only because it survived there after disappearing elsewhere.\r\nThere is a tradition too, he says, in Ulster that the recognition of\r\nthis tenant-right as a binding custom there is really due to Lord\r\nCastlereagh. It would be a curious thing, could this be verified, to\r\nfind Lord Castlereagh, whose name has been execrated in Ireland for\r\nfourscore years, recommending and securing a century ago that\r\nrecognition of the interest of the Irish tenant in his holding, which,\r\nin our time, Mr. Gladstone, just now the object of Irish adulation, was,\r\nwith much difficulty and reluctance, brought to accord in the\r\nCompensation for Disturbances clause of his Act of 1870!\r\n\r\nOf this clause, too, I am told to-night that the scale of compensation\r\nfixed for the awards of the Court in the third section of it was devised\r\n(though Mr. Gladstone did not know this) by an Irish member in the\r\ninterest of the \"strong farmers,\" who wish to root out the small\r\nfarmers. There is an apparent confirmation of this story in the fact\r\nthat under this section the small farmers, under £10, may be awarded\r\nagainst the landlord seven years' rent as compensation for disturbance,\r\nwhile the number of years to be accounted for in the award diminishes as\r\nthe rental increases, a discrimination not unlikely to strengthen the\r\npreference of the landlords for the large farm system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Tuesday, Feb. 14th._--I left Abbeyleix this morning for Dublin,\r\nin company with Mr. and Mrs. Henry Doyle. Mr. Doyle, C.B., a brother of\r\nthat inimitable master of the pencil, and most delightful of men,\r\nRichard Doyle, is the Director of the Irish National Gallery. He was\r\nkind enough to come and lunch with me at Maple's, after which we went\r\ntogether to the Gallery. It occupies the upper floors of a stately and\r\nhandsome building in Merrion Square, in front of which stands a statue\r\nof the founder, Mr. William Dargan, who defrayed all the expenses of the\r\nDublin Exhibition in 1853, and declined all the honours offered to him\r\nin recognition of his public spirited liberality, save a visit paid to\r\nhis wife by Queen Victoria. The collection now under Mr. Doyle's charge\r\nwas begun only in 1864, and the Government makes it an annual grant of\r\nno more than £2500, or about one-half the current price, in these days,\r\nof a fine Gainsborough or Sir Joshua! \"They manage these things better\r\nin France,\" was evidently the impression of a recent French tourist in\r\nIreland, M. Daryl, whose book I picked up the other day in Paris, for\r\nafter mentioning three or four of the pictures, and gravely affirming\r\nthat the existence here of a gallery of Irish portraits proves the\r\npassionate devotion of Dublin to Home Rule, he dismisses the collection\r\nwith the verdict that \"_ce ne vaut pas le diable_.\" Nevertheless it\r\nalready contains more really good pictures than the Musée either of\r\nLyons or of Marseilles, both of them much larger and wealthier cities\r\nthan Dublin. Leaving out the Three Maries of Perugino at Marseilles, and\r\nat Lyons the Ascension, which was once the glory of San Pietro di\r\nPerugia, the Moses of Paul Veronese, and Palma Giovanni's Flagellation,\r\nthese two galleries put together cannot match Dublin with its Jan Steen,\r\nmost characteristic without being coarse, its Terburg, a life-size\r\nportrait of the painter's favourite model, a young Flemish gentleman,\r\npresented to him as a token of regard, its portrait of a Venetian\r\npersonage by Giorgione, with a companion portrait by Gian Bellini, its\r\nbeautiful Italian landscape by Jan Both, its flower-wreathed head of a\r\nwhite bull by Paul Potter, its exquisitely finished \"Vocalists\" by\r\nCornells Begyn, its admirable portrait of a Dutch gentleman by Murillo,\r\nand its two excellent Jacob Ruysdaels. A good collection is making, too,\r\nof original drawings, and engravings, and a special room is devoted to\r\nmodern Irish art. I wish the Corcoran Gallery (founded, too, by an\r\nIrishman!) were half as worthy of Washington, or the Metropolitan Museum\r\none-tenth part as worthy of New York!\r\n\r\nThe National Gallery in London has loaned some pictures to Dublin, and\r\nMr. Doyle is getting together, from private owners, a most interesting\r\ngallery of portraits of men and women famous in connection with Irish\r\nhistory. The beautiful Gunnings of the last century, the not less\r\nbeautiful and much more brilliant Sheridans of our own, Burke, Grattan,\r\nTom Moore, Wellington, Curran, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, O'Connell, Peg\r\nWoffington, Canning, and Castlereagh, Dean Swift, Laurence Sterne are\r\nall here--wits and statesmen, soldiers and belles, rebels and royalists,\r\norators and poets. Two things strike one in this gallery of the \"glories\r\nof Ireland.\" The great majority of the faces are of the Anglo-Irish or\r\nScoto-Irish type; and the collection owes its existence to an\r\naccomplished public officer, who bears an Irish name, who is a devout\r\nCatholic, and who is also an outspoken opponent of the Home Rule\r\ncontention as now carried on.\r\n\r\nThe gallery is open on liberal conditions to students. Mr. Doyle tells\r\nme that a young sister of Mr. Parnell was at one time an assiduous\r\nstudent here. He used to stop and chat with her about her work as he\r\npassed through the gallery. One day he met her coming out. \"Mr. Doyle,\"\r\nshe said, \"are you a Home Ruler?\" \"Certainly not,\" he replied\r\ngood-naturedly. Whereupon, with an air of melancholy resignation, the\r\nyoung lady said, \"Then we can never more be friends!\" and therewith\r\nflitted forth.\r\n\r\nA small room contains some admirable bits of the work of Richard Doyle,\r\namong other things a weird and grotesque, but charming cartoon of an\r\nelfish procession passing through a quaint and picturesque mediaeval\r\ncity. It is a _conte fantastique_ in colour--a marvel of affluent fancy\r\nand masterly skill.\r\n\r\nI found here this morning letters calling me over to Paris for a short\r\ntime, and one also from Mr. Davitt, in London, explaining that my note\r\nto him through the National League had never reached him, and that he\r\nhad gone to London on his woollen business. I have written asking him to\r\nmeet me to-morrow in London, and I shall cross over to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON, _Wednesday, Feb. 15th._--Mr. Davitt spent an hour with me\r\nto-day, and we had a most interesting conversation. His mind is just now\r\nfull of the woollen enterprise he is managing, which promises, he\r\nthinks, in spite of our tariff, to open the American markets to the\r\nexcellent woollen goods of Ireland. He has gone into it with all his\r\nusual earnestness and ability. This is not a matter of politics with\r\nhim, but of patriotism and of business. He tells me he has already\r\nsecured very large orders from the United States. I hope he is not\r\nsurprised, as I certainly am not, to find that the Parliamentarian Irish\r\nparty give but a half-hearted and lukewarm support to such enterprises\r\nas this. Perhaps he has forgotten, as I have not, the efforts which a\r\ncertain member of that party made in 1886 to persuade an Irish gentleman\r\nfrom St. Louis, who had brought over a considerable sum of money for the\r\nrelief of the distress in North-Western Ireland, into turning it over\r\nto the League, on the express ground that the more the people were made\r\nto feel the pinch of the existing order of things, the better it would\r\nbe for the revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Woollen Company will, nevertheless, be a success, I believe,\r\nand a success of considerably more value to Ireland than the election of\r\nMr. Wilfrid Blunt as M.P. for Deptford would be.\r\n\r\nAs to this election, Mr. Davitt seems to feel no great confidence. He\r\nhas spoken in support of Mr. Blunt's candidacy, and is hard at work now\r\nto promote it. But he is not sanguine as to the result, as on all\r\nquestions, save Home Rule for Ireland, Mr. Blunt's views and ideas, he\r\nthinks, antagonise the record of Mr. Evelyn and the local feeling at\r\nDeptford. I was almost astonished to learn from Mr. Davitt that Mr.\r\nBlunt, by the way, had told him at Ballybrack, long before he was locked\r\nup, how Mr. Balfour meant to lock up and kill four men, the \"pivots\" of\r\nthe Irish movement, to wit, Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Harrington, Mr. Dillon, and\r\nMr. Davitt himself. But I was not at all astonished to learn that Mr.\r\nBlunt told him all this most seriously, and evidently believed it.\r\n\r\n\"How did you take it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I only laughed,\" said Mr. Davitt, \"and told him it would take more\r\nthan Mr. Balfour to kill me, at any rate by putting me in prison. As for\r\nbeing locked up, I prefer Cuninghame Graham's way of taking it, that he\r\nmeant 'to beat the record on oakum!'\"\r\n\r\nIf all the Irish \"leaders\" were made of the same stuff with Mr. Davitt,\r\nthe day of a great Democratic revolution, not in Ireland only, but in\r\nGreat Britain, might be a good deal nearer than anything in the signs of\r\nthe times now shows it to be. Mr. Parnell and the National League are\r\nreally nothing but the mask of Mr. Davitt and the Land League. Mr.\r\nForster knew what he was about when he proclaimed the Land League in\r\nOctober 1881, six months or more after he had arrested and locked up Mr.\r\nDavitt in Portland prison. This was shown by the foolish No-Rent\r\nmanifesto which Mr. Parnell and his associates issued from Kilmainham\r\nshortly after their incarceration, and without the counsel or consent at\r\nthat time of Mr. Davitt--a manifesto which the Archbishop of Cashel,\r\ndespite his early sympathies and connection with the agrarian agitation\r\nof 1848, found it expedient promptly to disavow. It would have been\r\nstill more clearly shown had not Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Forster parted\r\ncompany under the restiveness of Mr. Gladstone's Radical followers, and\r\nthe pressure of the United States Government in the spring of 1882. But\r\nafter the withdrawal of Mr. Forster, and the release of Mr. Davitt, the\r\nEnglish lawyers and politicians who led Lord Spencer and Sir George\r\nTrevelyan into allowing the Land League to be revived under the\r\ntransparent alias of the National League, gave Mr. Davitt an\r\nopportunity, of which he promptly availed himself, to regain the ground\r\nlost by the blundering of the men of Kilmainham. From that time forth I\r\nhave always regarded him as the soul of the Irish agitation, of the war\r\nagainst \"landlordism\" (which is incidentally, of course, a war against\r\nthe English influence in Ireland), and of the movement towards Irish\r\nindependence. Whether the agitation, the war, and the movement have gone\r\nentirely in accordance with his views and wishes is quite another\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI have too good an opinion of his capacity to believe that they have;\r\nand when the secret history of the Chicago Convention comes to be\r\nwritten, I expect to find such confirmation therein of my notions on\r\nthis subject as I could neither ask nor, if I asked, could expect to get\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the manliness and courage of the man must always command for\r\nhim the respect, not to say the admiration, even of those who most\r\nsternly condemn his course and oppose his policy.\r\n\r\nBorn the child of an evicted tenant, in the times when an eviction meant\r\nsuch misery and suffering as are seldom, if ever, now caused by the\r\nprocess--bred and maimed for life in an English factory--captured when\r\nhardly more than a lad in Captain M'Cafferty's daring attempt to seize\r\nChester Castle, and sent for fifteen years by Lord Chief-Justice\r\nCockburn into penal servitude of the most rigorous kind, Michael Davitt\r\nmight have been expected to be an apostle of hate not against the\r\nEnglish Government of Ireland alone, but against England and the English\r\npeople. The truculent talk of too many of his countrymen presents\r\nIreland to the minds of thoughtful men as a flagrant illustration of the\r\ntruth so admirably put by Aubrey de Vere that \"worse than wasted weal is\r\nwasted woe.\" But woe has not been wasted upon Michael Davitt, in this,\r\nthat, so far as I know (and I have watched his course now with lively\r\npersonal interest ever since I made his acquaintance on his first visit\r\nto America), he has never made revenge and retaliation upon England\r\neither the inspiration or the aim of his revolutionary policy. I have\r\nnever heard him utter, and never heard of his uttering, in America, such\r\nmalignant misrepresentations of the conduct of the English people and\r\ntheir sovereign during the great famine of 1847, for example, as those\r\nwhich earned for Mr. Parnell in 1880 the pretty unanimous condemnation\r\nof the American press. How far he went with Mr. Parnell on the lines of\r\nthat speech at New Ross, in which murder was delicately mentioned as \"an\r\nunnecessary and prejudicial measure of procedure\" in certain\r\ncircumstances, I do not know. But he can hardly have gone further than\r\ncertain persons calling themselves English Liberals went when the\r\nassassins of Napoleon III. escaped to England. And he has a capacity of\r\nbeing just to opponents, which certainly all his associates do not\r\npossess. I was much struck to-day by the candour and respect with which\r\nhe spoke of John Bright, whose name came incidentally into our\r\nconversation. He seemed to feel personally annoyed and hurt as an\r\nIrishman, that Irishmen should permit themselves to revile and abuse Mr.\r\nBright because he will not go with them on the question of Home Rule, in\r\nutter oblivion of the great services rendered by him to the cause of\r\nthe Irish people \"years before many of those whose tongues now wag\r\nagainst him had tongues to wag.\" I was tempted to remind him that not\r\nwith Irishmen only is gratitude a lively sense of favours to come.\r\n\r\nI find Mr. Davitt quite awake to the great importance of the granite\r\nquarries of Donegal. He is bestirring himself in connection with some\r\nmen of Manchester, in behalf of the quarries at Belmullet in Mayo,\r\nwhich, if I am not mistaken, is his native county. This bent of his mind\r\ntowards the material improvement of the condition of the Irish people,\r\nand the development of the resources of Ireland, is not only a mark of\r\nhis superiority to the rank and file of the Irish politicians--it goes\r\nfar to explain the stronger hold which he undoubtedly has on the people\r\nin Ireland. \"Home Rule,\" as now urged by the Irish politicians,\r\ncertainly excites much more attention and emotion in America and England\r\nthan it seems to do in Ireland. It seems so simple and elementary to\r\nJohn Bull and Brother Jonathan that people should be suffered to manage\r\ntheir own affairs! Yet the North would not suffer the South to do\r\nthis--and what would become of India if England turned it over in\r\nfragments to the native races? The Land Question, on the contrary,\r\ntouches the \"business and bosom\" of every Irishman in Ireland, while it\r\nis so complicated with historical conditions and incidents as to be\r\ntroublesome and therefore uninteresting to people not immediately\r\naffected by it. If I am right in my impressions the collapse of the\r\nNational League will hardly weaken the hold of Mr. Davitt on the Irish\r\npeople in Ireland, and it may even strengthen his hold on the agrarian\r\nmovement in Wales, England, and Scotland, unless he identifies himself\r\ntoo completely in that collapse with his Parliamentary instruments. On\r\nthe other hand, the triumph of the National League on its present lines\r\nof action would diminish the value for good or evil of any man's hold\r\nupon the Irish people, for the obvious reason that by driving out of\r\nIreland, and ruining, the class of \"landlords\" and capitalists, it would\r\nleave the country reduced to a dead level of peasant-holdings, saddled\r\nwith a system of poor-rates beyond the ability of the peasant-holders to\r\ncarry, and at the mercy, therefore, of the first bad year. The \"war\r\nagainst the landlords,\" as conducted by the National League, would end\r\nwhere the Irish difficulty began, in a general surrender of the people\r\nto \"poverty and potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nENNIS, _Saturday, Feb. 18._--I found it unnecessary to go on to Paris,\r\nand so returned to Ireland on Thursday night; we had a passage as over a\r\nlake. In the train I met a lively Nationalist friend, whose acquaintance\r\nI made in America. He is a man of substance, but not overburdened with\r\nrespect for the public men, either of his own party or of the Unionist\r\nside. When I asked him whether he still thought it would be safe to turn\r\nover Ireland to a Parliament made up of the Westminster members, of whom\r\nhe gave me such an amusing but by no means complimentary account, he\r\nlooked at me with astonishment:--\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose for a moment we would send these fellows to a Parliament\r\nin Dublin?\"\r\n\r\nHe told me some very entertaining tales of the methods used by certain\r\nwell-meaning occupants of the Castle in former days to capture Irish\r\npopularity, as, for example, one of a Vice-Queen who gave a fancy dress\r\nball for the children of the local Dublin people of importance, and had\r\na beautiful supper of tea and comfits, and cakes served to them, after\r\nwhich she made her appearance, followed by servants bearing huge bowls\r\nof steaming hot Irish potatoes, which she pressed upon the horrified and\r\noverstuffed infants as \"the true food of the country,\" setting them\r\nherself the example of eating one with much apparent gusto, and a pinch\r\nof salt!\r\n\r\n\"Now, fancy that!\" he exclaimed; \"for the Dublin aristocracy who think\r\nthe praties only fit for the peasants!\"\r\n\r\nOf a well-known and popular personage in politics, he told me that he\r\nonce went with him on a canvassing tour. It was in a county the\r\ncandidate had never before visited. \"When we came to a place, and the\r\npeople were all out crying and cheering, he would whisper to me, 'Now\r\nwhat is the name of this confounded hole?' And I would whisper back,\r\n'Ballylahnich,' or whatever it was. Then he would draw himself up to the\r\nheight of a round tower, and begin, 'Men of Ballylahnich, I rejoice to\r\nmeet you! Often has the great Liberator said to me, with tears in his\r\nvoice, 'Oh would I might find myself face to face with the noble men of\r\nBallylahnich!\"\r\n\r\n\"A great man he is, a great man!\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear how he courted the heiress? He walked up and down in\r\nfront of her house, and threatened to fight every man that came to call,\r\ntill he drove them all away!\"\r\n\r\nA good story of more recent date, I must also note, of a well-known\r\npriest in Dublin, who being asked by Mr. Balfour one day whether the\r\npeople under his charge took for gospel all the rawhead and bloody-bones\r\ntales about himself, replied, \"Indeed, I wish they only feared and hated\r\nthe devil half as much as they do you!\"\r\n\r\nIn a more serious vein my Nationalist friend explained to me that for\r\nhim \"Home Rule\" really meant an opportunity of developing the resources\r\nof Ireland under \"the American system of Protection.\" About this he was\r\nquite in earnest, and recalled to me the impassioned protests made by\r\nthe then Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Carter Harrison, against the Revenue\r\nReform doctrines which I had thought it right to set forth at the great\r\nmeeting of the Iroquois Club in that city in 1883. \"Of course,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you know that Mr. Harrison was then speaking not only for\r\nhimself, but for the whole Irish vote of Chicago which was solidly\r\nbehind him? And not of Chicago only! All our people on your side of the\r\nwater moved against your party in 1884, and will move against it again,\r\nonly much more generally, this year, because they know that the real\r\nhope of Ireland lies in our shaking ourselves free of the British Free\r\nTrade that has been fastened upon us, and is taking our life.\" I could\r\nonly say that this was a more respectable, if not a more reasonable,\r\nexplanation of Mr. Alexander Sullivan's devotion to Mr. Blaine and the\r\nRepublicans, and of the Irish defection from the Democratic party than\r\nhad ever been given to me in America, but I firmly refused to spend the\r\nnight between London and Dublin in debating the question whether Meath\r\ncould be made as prosperous as Massachusetts by levying forty per cent.\r\nduties on Manchester goods imported into Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the reception of Mr. Sullivan, M.P., in London. \"I believe,\r\non my soul,\" he said, \"the people were angry with him because he didn't\r\ncome in a Lord Mayor's coach!\"\r\n\r\nWhen I told him I meant to visit Luggacurren, he said, a little to my\r\nsurprise, \"That is a bad job for us, and all because of William\r\nO'Brien's foolishness! He always thinks everybody takes note of whatever\r\nhe says, and that ruins any man! He made a silly threat at Luggacurren,\r\nthat he would go and take Lansdowne by the throat in Canada, and then he\r\nwas weak enough to suppose that he was bound to carry it out. He\r\ncouldn't be prevented! And what was the upshot of it? But for the\r\nOrangemen in Canada, that were bigger fools than he is, he would have\r\nbeen just ruined completely! It was the Orangemen saved him!\"\r\n\r\nI left Dublin this morning at 7.40 A.M. The day was fine, and the\r\nrailway journey most interesting. Before reaching Limerick we passed\r\nthrough so much really beautiful country that I could not help\r\nexpressing my admiration of it to my only fellow-traveller, a most\r\ncourteous and lively gentleman, who, but for a very positive brogue,\r\nmight have been taken for an English guardsman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a beautiful country,\" he said, \"or would be if they would\r\nlet it alone!\"\r\n\r\nI asked him what he specially objected to in the recent action of\r\nParliament as respects Ireland?\r\n\r\n\"Object?\" he responded; \"I object to everything. The only thing that\r\nwill do Ireland any good will be to shut up that talking-mill at\r\nWestminster for a good long while!\"\r\n\r\nThis, I told him, was the remedy proposed by Earl Grey in his recent\r\nvolume on Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"Is it indeed? I shall read the book. But what's the use? 'For judgment\r\nit is fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.'\"\r\n\r\nThis he said most cheerily, as if it really didn't matter much; and,\r\nbidding me good-bye, disappeared at Limerick, where several friends met\r\nhim. In his place came a good-natured optimistic squire, who thinks\r\n\"things are settling down.\" There is a rise in the price of cattle.\r\n\"Beasts I gave £8 for three mouths ago,\" he said, \"I have just sold for\r\n£12. I call that a healthy state of things.\" And with this he also left\r\nme at Ardsollus, the station nearest the famous old monastery of Quin.\r\n\r\nAt Ennis I was met by Colonel Turner, to whom I had written, enclosing a\r\nnote of introduction to him. With him were Mr. Roche, one of the local\r\nmagistrates, and Mr. Richard Stacpoole, a gentleman of position and\r\nestate near Ennis, about whom, through no provocation of his, a great\r\ndeal has been said and written of late years. Mr. Stacpoole at once\r\ninsisted that I should let him take me out to stay at his house at\r\nEdenvale, which is, so to speak, at the gates of Ennis. Certainly the\r\nfame of Irish hospitality is well-founded! Meanwhile my traps were\r\ndeposited at the County Club, and I went about the town. I walked up to\r\nthe Court-house with. Mr. Roche, in the hope of hearing a case set down\r\nfor trial to-day, in which a publican named Harding, at Ennis--an\r\nEnglishman, by the way--is prosecuted for boycotting. The parties were\r\nin Court; and the defendant's counsel, a keen-looking Irish lawyer, Mr.\r\nLeamy, once a Nationalist member, was ready for action; but for some\r\ntechnical reason the hearing was postponed. There were few people in\r\nCourt, and little interest seemed to be felt in the matter. The\r\nCourt-house is a good building, not unlike the White House at Washington\r\nin style. This is natural enough, the White House having been built, I\r\nbelieve, by an Irish architect, who must have had the Duke of Leinster's\r\nhouse of Carton, in Kildare, in his mind when he planned it. Carton was\r\nthought a model mansion at the beginning of this century; and Mr.\r\nWhetstone, a local architect of repute, built the Ennis Court-house some\r\nfifty years ago. It is of white limestone from quarries belonging to\r\nMr. Stacpoole, and cost when built about £12,000. To build it now would\r\ncost nearly three times as much. In fact, a recent and smaller\r\nCourt-house at Carlow has actually cost £36,000 within the last few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the extraordinary number of public-houses in Ennis. A\r\nsergeant of police said to me, \"It is so all over the country.\" Mr.\r\nRoche sent for the statistics, from which it appears that Ennis, with a\r\npopulation of 6307, rejoices in no fewer than 100 \"publics\"; Ennistymon,\r\nwith a population of 1331, has 25; and Milltown Malbay, with a\r\npopulation of 1400, has 36. At Castle Island the proportion is still\r\nmore astounding--51 public-houses in a population of 800. In Kiltimagh\r\nevery second house is a public-house! These houses are perhaps a legacy\r\nof the old days of political jobbery.[19] No matter when or why granted,\r\nthe licence appears to be regarded as a hereditary \"right\" not lightly\r\nto be tampered with; and of course the publicans are persons of\r\nconsequence in their neighbourhood, no matter how wretched it may be,\r\nor how trifling their legitimate business. Three police convictions are\r\nrequired to make the resident magistrates refuse the usual yearly\r\nrenewal of a licence; and if an application is made against such a\r\nrenewal, cause must be shown. The \"publics\" are naturally centres of\r\nlocal agitation, and the publicans are sharp enough to see the advantage\r\nto them of this. The sergeant told me of a publican here in Ennis, into\r\nwhose public came three Nationalists, bent not upon drinking, but upon\r\ntalking. The publican said nothing for a while, but finally, in a\r\ncareless way, mentioned \"a letter he had just received from Mr. Parnell\r\non a very private matter.\" Instantly the politicians were eager to see\r\nit. The publican hesitated. The politicians immediately called for\r\ndrinks, which were served, and after this operation had been three times\r\nrepeated, the publican produced the letter, began with a line or two,\r\nand then said, \"Ah, no! it can't be done. It would be a betrayal of\r\nconfidence; and you know you wouldn't have that! But it's a very\r\nimportant letter you have seen!\" So they went away tipsy and happy.\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday no fewer than twenty-three of these publicans from\r\nMilltown Malbay appeared at Ennis here to be tried for \"boycotting\" the\r\npolice. One of them was acquitted; another, a woman, was discharged. Ten\r\nof them signed, in open court, a guarantee not further to conspire, and\r\nwere thereupon discharged upon their own recognisances, after having\r\nbeen sentenced with their companions to a month's imprisonment with hard\r\nlabour. The magistrate tells me that when the ten who signed (and who\r\nwere the most prosperous of the publicans) were preparing to sign, the\r\nonly representative of the press who was present, a reporter for _United\r\nIreland_, approached them in a threatening manner, with such an obvious\r\npurpose of intimidation, that he was ordered out of the court-room by\r\nthe police. The eleven who refused to sign the guarantee (and who were\r\nthe poorest of the publicans, with least to lose) were sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of this case is the conduct of Father White, the\r\nparish priest of Milltown Malbay. In the open court, Colonel Turner\r\ntells me, Father White admitted that he was the moving spirit of all\r\nthis local \"boycott.\" While the court was sitting yesterday all the\r\nshops in Milltown Malbay were closed, Father White having publicly\r\nordered the people to make the town \"as a city of the dead.\" After the\r\ntrial was over, and the eleven who elected to be locked up had left in\r\nthe train, Father White visited all their houses to encourage the\r\nfamilies, which, from his point of view, was no doubt proper enough; but\r\none of the sergeants reports that the Father went by mistake into the\r\nhouse of one of the ten who had signed the guarantee, and immediately\r\nreappeared, using rather unclerical language. All this to an American\r\nresembles a tempest in a tea-pot. But it is a serious matter to see a\r\npriest of the Church assisting laymen to put their fellow-men under a\r\nsocial interdict, which is obviously a parody on one of the gravest\r\nsteps the Church itself can take to maintain the doctrine and the\r\ndiscipline of the Faith. What Catholics, if honest, must think of this\r\nwhole business, I saw curiously illustrated by some marginal notes\r\npencilled in a copy of Sir Francis Head's _Fortnight in Ireland_, at the\r\nhotel in Gweedore. The author of the _Bubbles from the Brunnen_\r\npublished this book in 1852. At page 152 he tells a story, apparently on\r\nhearsay, of \"boycotting\" long before Boycott. It is to the effect that,\r\nin order to check the proselyting of Catholics by a combination of\r\nProtestant missionary zeal with Protestant donations of \"meal,\" certain\r\npriests and sisters in the south of Ireland personally instructed the\r\npeople to avoid all intercourse of any sort with any Roman Catholic who\r\n\"listened to a Protestant clergyman or a Scripture Reader\"; and Sir\r\nFrancis cites an instance--still apparently on hearsay--of a \"shoemaker\r\nat Westport,\" who, having seceded from the Church, found that not a\r\nsingle \"journeyman dared work for him\"; that only \"one person would sell\r\nhim leather\"; and, \"in short, lost his custom, and rapidly came to a\r\nstate of starvation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the pages which record these statements, certain\r\nindignant Catholics have pencilled comments, the mildest of which is to\r\nthe effect that Sir Francis was \"a most damnable liar.\" It is certainly\r\nmost unlikely that Catholics should have arrogated to themselves the\r\nChurch's function of combating heresy and schism in the fashion\r\ndescribed by Sir Francis. But without mooting that question, these\r\nexpressions are noteworthy as showing how just such proceedings, as are\r\ninvolved in the political \"boycottings\" of the present day, must be\r\nregarded by all honest and clear-headed people who call themselves\r\nCatholics; and it is a serious scandal that a parish priest should lay\r\nhimself open to the imputation of acting in concert with any political\r\nbody whatever, on any pretext whatever, to encourage such proceedings.\r\n\r\nI asked one of the sergeants how the publicans who had signed the\r\nguarantee would probably be treated by their townspeople. He replied,\r\nthere was some talk of their being \"boycotted\" in their turn by the\r\nbutchers and bakers. \"But it's all nonsense,\" he said, \"they are the\r\nsnuggest (the most prosperous) publicans in this part of the country,\r\nand nobody will want to vex them. They have many friends, and the best\r\nfriend they have is that they can afford to give credit to the country\r\npeople. There'll be no trouble with them at all at all!\"\r\n\r\nWalking about the town, I saw many placards calling for subscriptions in\r\naid of a newsvendor who has been impounded for selling _United Ireland_.\r\n\"It'll be a good thing for him,\" said a cynical citizen, to whom I spoke\r\nof it, \"a good deal better than he'd be by selling the papers.\" And, in\r\nfact, it is noticeable all over Ireland how small the sales of the\r\npapers appear to be. The people about the streets in Ennis, however,\r\nseemed to me much more effervescent and hot in tone than the Dublin\r\npeople are--and this on both sides of the question. One very decent and\r\nsubstantial-looking man, when I told him I was an American, assured me\r\nthat \"if it was not for the soldiers, the people of Ennis would clear\r\nthe police out of the place.\" He told me, too, that not long ago the\r\nsoldiers of an Irish regiment here cheered for Home Rule in the\r\nCourt-house, \"but they were soon sent away for that same.\" On the other\r\nhand, a Protestant man of business, of whom I made some inquiries about\r\nthe transmission of an important paper to the United States in time to\r\ncatch to-morrow's steamer from Queenstown, spoke of the Home Rulers\r\nalmost with ferocity, and thought the \"Coercion\" Government at Dublin\r\nought to be called the \"Concession\" Government. He was quite indignant\r\nthat the Morley and Ripon procession through the streets of Dublin\r\nshould not have been \"forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some considerable shops in Ennis, but the proprietor of one of\r\nthe best of them says all this agitation has \"killed the trade of the\r\nplace.\" I am not surprised to learn that the farmers and their families\r\nare beginning seriously to demand that the \"reduction screw\" shall be\r\napplied to other things besides rent. \"A very decent farmer,\" he says,\r\n\"only last week stood up in the shop and said it was 'a shame the\r\nshopkeepers were not made to reduce the tenpence muslin goods to\r\nsixpence!'\"\r\n\r\nThis shopkeeper finds some dreary consolation for the present state of\r\nthings in standing at his deserted shop-door and watching the doors of\r\nhis brethren. He finds them equally deserted. In his own he has had to\r\ndismiss a number of his attendants. \"When a man finds he is taking in\r\nten shillings a day, and laying out three pounds ten, what can he do but\r\npull up pretty short?\" As with the shopkeepers, so it is with the\r\nmechanics. \"They are losing custom all the time. You see the tenants are\r\nexpecting to come into the properties, so they spend nothing now on\r\npainting or improvements. The money goes into the bank. It don't go to\r\nthe landlords, or to the shopkeepers, or the mechanics; and then we that\r\nhave been selling on credit, and long credit too, where are we?\r\nFormerly, from one place, Dromoland, Lord Inchiquin's house, we used\r\nregularly to make a bill of a hundred pounds at Christmas, for blankets\r\nand other things given away. Now the house is shut up and we make\r\nnothing!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a short but very pleasant drive from Ennis to Edenvale--and\r\nEdenvale itself is not ill-named. The park is a true park, with fine\r\nwide spaces and views, and beautiful clumps of trees. A swift river\r\nflows beyond the lawn in front of the spacious goodly house--a river\r\nalive with wild fowl, and overhung by lofty trees, in which many pairs\r\nof herons build. A famous heronry has existed here for many years, and\r\nthe birds are held now by Mr. and Mrs. Stacpoole as sacred as are the\r\nstorks in Holland. Where the river widens to a lake, fine terraced\r\ngardens and espalier walls, on which nectarines, apricots, and peaches\r\nripen in the sun, stretch along the shore. Deer come down to the further\r\nbank to drink, and in every direction the eye is charmed and the mind is\r\nsoothed by the loveliest imaginable sylvan landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDENVALE, _Sunday, Feb. 19._--I was awakened at dawn by the clamour of\r\ncountless wild ducks, to a day of sunshine as brilliant and almost as\r\nwarm as one sees at this season in the south of France. Mrs. Stacpoole\r\nspeaks of this place with a kind of passion, and I can quite understand\r\nit. Clearly this, again, is not a case of the absentee landlord draining\r\nthe lifeblood of the land to lavish it upon an alien soil! The demesne\r\nis a sylvan sanctuary for the wild creatures of the air and the wood,\r\nand they congregate here almost as they did at Walton Hall in the days\r\nof that most delightful of naturalists and travellers, whose adventurous\r\ngallop on the back of a cayman was the delight of all English-reading\r\nchildren forty years ago, or as they do now at Gosford. Yet the crack of\r\nthe gun, forbidden in the precincts of Walton Hall, is here by no means\r\nunknown--the whole family being noted as dead shots. I asked Mr.\r\nStacpoole this morning whether the park had been invaded by trespassers\r\nsince the local Nationalists declared war upon him. He said that his\r\nonly experience of anything like an attack befell not very long ago,\r\nwhen his people came to the house on a Sunday afternoon and told him\r\nthat a crowd of men from Ennis, with dogs, were coming towards the park\r\nwith a loudly proclaimed intent to enter it, and go hunting upon the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nUpon this Mr. Stacpoole left the house with his brother and another\r\nperson, and walked down to the park entrance. Presently the men of Ennis\r\nmade their appearance on the highway. A very brief parley followed. The\r\nmen of Ennis announced their intention of marching across the park, and\r\noccupying it.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" the proprietor responded quietly. \"I think you will go\r\nback the way you came. For you may be sure of one thing: the first man\r\nwho crosses that park wall, or enters that gate, is a dead man.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no show of weapons, but the revolvers were there, and this the\r\nmen of Ennis knew. They also knew that it rested with themselves to\r\ncreate the right and the occasion to use the revolvers, and that if the\r\nrevolvers were used they would be used to some purpose. To their credit,\r\nbe it said, as men of sense, they suddenly experienced an almost\r\nCaledonian respect for the \"Sabbath-day,\" and after expressing their\r\ndiscontent with Mr. Stacpoole's inhospitable reception, turned about and\r\nwent back whence they had come.\r\n\r\nThis morning an orderly from Ennis brought out news of the arrest\r\nyesterday, at the Clare Road, of Mr. Lloyd, a Labour delegate from\r\nLondon, on his return from an agitation meeting at Kildysart. Harding,\r\nthe Englishman I saw awaiting his trial yesterday, became bail for\r\nLloyd.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we took a delightful walk to Killone Abbey, a pile of\r\nmonastic ruins on a lovely site near a very picturesque lake. The ruins\r\nhave been used as a quarry by all the country, and are now by no means\r\nextensive. But the precincts are used as a graveyard, not only by the\r\npeople of Ennis, but by the farmers and villagers for many miles around.\r\nNothing can be imagined more painful than the appearance of these\r\nprecincts. The graves are, for the most part, shallow, and closely\r\nhuddled together. The cemetery, in truth, is a ghastly slum, a\r\n\"tenement-house\" of the dead. The dead of to-day literally elbow the\r\ndead of yesterday out of their resting-places, to be in their turn\r\ndisplaced by the dead of to-morrow. Instead of the crosses and the fresh\r\ngarlands, and the inscriptions full of loving thoughtfulness, which lend\r\na pathetic charm to the German \"courts of peace\"--instead of the\r\ncarefully tended hillocks and flower-studded turf which make the\r\nchurchyard of a typical old English village beautiful,--all here is\r\nconfusion, squalor, and neglect. Fragments of coffins and bones lie\r\nscattered among the sunken and shattered stones. We picked up a skull\r\nlying quite apart in a corner of the enclosure. A clean round bullet\r\nhole in the very centre of the frontal bone was dumbly and grimly\r\neloquent. Was it the skull of a patriot or of a policeman? of a\r\n\"White-boy\" or of a \"landlord\"?\r\n\r\nOne thing only was apparent from the conformation of the grisly relic.\r\nIt was the skull of a Celt. Probably, therefore, not of a land agent,\r\nshot to repress his fiduciary zeal, but perhaps of some peasant\r\nselfishly and recklessly bent on paying his rent.\r\n\r\nWhile we wandered amid the ruins we came suddenly upon a woman wearing a\r\nlong Irish cloak, and accompanied by two well-dressed men. One of the\r\nmen started upon catching sight of Colonel Turner, who was of our party,\r\ngrew quite red for a moment, and then very civilly exchanged salutations\r\nwith him. The party walked quietly away on a lower road leading to\r\nEnnis. When they had gone Colonel Turner told us that the man who had\r\nspoken to him was a local Nationalist of repute and influence in Ennis.\r\n\"He would never have ventured to be civil to me in the town,\" he said. A\r\ndiscussion arose as to the probable object of the party in visiting\r\nthese ruins. A gentleman who was with us half-laughingly suggested that\r\nthey might have been putting away dynamite bombs for an attack on\r\nEdenvale. Colonel Turner's more practical and probable theory was that\r\nthey were looking about for a site for the grave of the Fenian veteran,\r\nStephen J. Meany, who died in America not long ago. He was a native, I\r\nbelieve, of Ennis, and his remains are now on their way across the\r\nAtlantic for interment in his birth-place. \"Would a processional funeral\r\nbe allowed for him?\" I asked. Colonel Turner could see no reason why it\r\nshould not be.\r\n\r\nOne exception I noted to the general slovenliness of the graves. A new\r\nand handsome monument had just been set up by a man of Ennis, living in\r\nAustralia, to the memory of his father and mother, buried here twenty\r\nyears ago. But this touching symbol of a heart untravelled, fondly\r\nturning to its home, had been so placed, either by accident or by\r\ndesign, as to block the entrance way to the vault of a family living, or\r\nrather owning property, in this neighbourhood. Until within a year or\r\ntwo past this family had occupied a very handsome mansion in a park\r\nadjoining the park of Edenvale. But the heir, worn out with local\r\nhostilities, and reduced in fortune by the pressure of the times and of\r\nthe League, has now thrown up the sponge. His ancestral acres have been\r\nturned over for cultivation to Mr. Stacpoole. His house, a large fine\r\nbuilding, apparently of the time of James II., containing, I am told,\r\nsome good pictures and old furniture, is shut up, as are the model\r\nstables, ample enough for a great stud; and so another centre of local\r\nindustry and activity is made sterile.\r\n\r\nNear the ruins of Killone is a curious ancient shrine of St. John,\r\nbeside a spring known as the Holy Well. All about the rude little altar\r\nin the open air simple votive offerings were displayed, and Mrs.\r\nStacpoole tells me pilgrims come here from Galway and Connemara to climb\r\nthe hill upon their knees, and drink of the water. Last year for the\r\nfirst time within the memory of man the well went dry. Such was the\r\ndistress caused in Ennis by this news, that on the eve of St. John\r\ncertain pious persons came out from the town, drew water from the lake,\r\nand poured it into the well!\r\n\r\nAs we walked away one of the party pointed to a rabbit fleeing swiftly\r\ninto a hole in one of the graves. \"I was on this hill,\" he said, \"one\r\nday not very long ago when a funeral train came out from Ennis. As it\r\nentered the precincts a rabbit ran rapidly across the grounds. Instantly\r\nthe procession broke up; the coffin was literally dropped to the\r\nground, and the bearers, the mourners, and the whole company united in a\r\nhot and general chase of bunny. Of course, I need not say,\" he added,\r\n\"that there was no priest with them. The fixed charge of the priest for\r\na burial is twenty shillings, but there is usually no service at the\r\ngrave whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThis may possibly be a trace of the practices which grew up under the\r\nPenal Laws against Catholics. When Rinuccini came to Ireland in the time\r\nof the Civil War, he found the observances of the Church all fallen into\r\ndegradation through these laws. The Holy Sacrifice was celebrated in the\r\ncabins, and not unfrequently on tables which had been covered\r\nhalf-an-hour before with the remains of the last night's supper, and\r\nwould be cleared half-an-hour afterwards for the midday meal, and\r\nperhaps for a game of cards.\r\n\r\nSeveral guests joined us at dinner. One gentleman, a magistrate familiar\r\nwith Gweedore, told me he believed the statements of Sergeant Mahony as\r\nto the income of Father M'Fadden to fall within the truth. While he\r\nbelieves that many people in that region live, as he put it, \"constantly\r\nwithin a hair's-breadth of famine,\" he thinks that the great body of\r\nthe peasants there are in a position, \"with industry and thrift, not\r\nonly to make both ends meet, but to make them overlap.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stacpoole told us some of his own experiences nearer home. Not long\r\nago he was informed that the National League had ordered some decent\r\npeople, who hold the demesne lands of his neighbour, Mr. Macdonald\r\n(already alluded to) at a very low rental, to make a demand for a\r\nreduction, which would have left Mr. Macdonald without a penny of\r\nincome. To counter this Mr. Stacpoole offered to take the lands over for\r\npasture at the existing rental, whereupon the tenants promptly made up\r\ntheir minds to keep their holdings in defiance of the League.\r\n\r\nLast year a man, whom Mr. Stacpoole had regarded as a \"good\" tenant,\r\ncame to him, bringing the money to pay his rent. \"I have the rint,\r\nsorr,\" the man said, \"but it is God's truth I dare not pay it to ye!\"\r\nOther tenants were waiting outside. \"Are you such a coward that you\r\ndon't dare be honest?\" said Mr. Stacpoole. The man turned rather red,\r\nwent and looked out of all the windows, one after another, lifted up the\r\nheavy cloth of the large table in the room, and peeped under it\r\nnervously, and finally walked up to Mr. Stacpoole and paid the money.\r\nThe receipt being handed to him, he put it back with his hand, eyed it\r\naskance as if it were a bomb, and finally took it, and carefully put it\r\ninto the lining of his hat, after which, opening the door with a great\r\nnoise, he exclaimed as he went out, \"I'm very, very sorry, master, that\r\nI can't meet you about it!\" This man is now as loud in protestation of\r\nhis \"inability\" to pay his rent as any of the \"Campaigners.\" Mr.\r\nStacpoole thinks one great danger of the actual situation is that men\r\nwho were originally \"coerced\" by intimidation into dishonestly refusing\r\nto pay just rents, which they were abundantly able to pay, are beginning\r\nnow to think that they will be, and ought to be, relieved by the law of\r\nthe land from any obligation to pay these rents.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be his impression that things look better, however, of late\r\nfor law and order. On Monday of last week at Ennis an example was made\r\nof a local official, which, he thinks, will do good. This was a Poor-Law\r\nGuardian named Grogan. He was bound over on Monday last to keep the\r\npeace for twelve months towards one George Pilkington. Pilkington, it\r\nappears, in contempt of the League, took and occupied, in 1886, a\r\ncertain farm in Tarmon West. For this he was \"boycotted\" from that time\r\nforth. In December last he was summoned, with others, before the Board\r\nof Guardians at Kilrush, to fix the rents of certain labourers'\r\ncottages. While he sat in the room awaiting the action of the Board,\r\nGrogan, one of its members, rose up, and, looking at Pilkington, said in\r\na loud voice, \"There's an obnoxious person here present that should not\r\nbe here, a land-grabber named Pilkington.\" There was a stir in the room,\r\nand Pilkington, standing up, said, \"I am here because I have had notice\r\nfrom the Guardians. If I am asked to leave the place, I shall not come\r\nback.\" The Chairman of the Board upon this declared that \"while the\r\nordinary business of the Board was transacting, Mr. Pilkington would be\r\nthere only by the courtesy of the Board;\" and treating the allusions of\r\nGrogan to Pilkington as a part of the business of the Board, he said, \"A\r\nmotion is before the Board, does any one second it?\" Another guardian,\r\nCollins, got up, and said \"I do.\" Thereupon the Chairman put it to the\r\nvote whether Pilkington should be requested to leave. The ayes had it,\r\nand the Chairman of the Board thereupon invited Pilkington to leave the\r\nmeeting which the Board had invited him to attend!\r\n\r\nGrogan has now been prosecuted for the offence of \"wrongfully, and\r\nwithout legal authority, using violence and intimidation to and towards\r\nGeorge Pilkington of Tarmon West, with a view to cause the said\r\nPilkington to abstain from doing an act which he had a legal right to\r\ndo, namely, to hold, occupy, and work on a certain farm of land at\r\nTarmon West.\"\r\n\r\nPlainly this case is one of a grapple between the two Governments which\r\nhave been and are now contending for the control of Ireland: the\r\nGovernment of the Queen of Ireland, which authorises Pilkington to take\r\nand farm a piece of land, and the Government of the National League,\r\nwhich forbids him to do this. Is it possible to doubt which of the two\r\nis the government of Liberty, as well as the government of Law?\r\n\r\nIt illustrates the demoralising influence upon society in Ireland of the\r\nprotracted toleration of such a contest as has been waging between the\r\nauthority of the Law and the authority of the League, that, when this\r\ncase came up for consideration ten days ago, an official here actually\r\nthought it ought to be put off. Colonel Turner insisted it should be\r\ndealt with at once; and so Mr. Grogan was proceeded against, with the\r\nresult I have stated.\r\n\r\nThe trees on this demesne are the finest I have so far seen in Ireland,\r\nbeautiful and vigorous pencil-cedars, ilexes, Scotch firs, and Irish\r\nyews. There is one noble cedar of Lebanon here worth a special trip to\r\nsee. In conversation about the country to-night, Mr. Stacpoole mentioned\r\nthat tobacco was grown here, strong and of good quality, and he was much\r\ninterested, as I remember were also the charming châtelaine of Newtown\r\nAnner and Mr. Le Poer of Gurteen four or five years ago, to learn how\r\nimmensely successful has been the tobacco-culture introduced into\r\nPennsylvania only a quarter of a century ago, as a consequence of the\r\nCivil War. The climatic conditions here are certainly not more\r\nunfavourable to such an experiment in agriculture than they were at\r\nfirst supposed to be in the Pennsylvanian counties of York and\r\nLancaster. Of course the Imperial excise would deal with it as harshly\r\nas it is now dealing with a similar experiment in England. But the Irish\r\ntobacco-growers would not now have to fear such hostile legislation as\r\nruined the Irish linen industries in the last century. The\r\n\"Moonlighters\" of 1888 lineally represent, if they do not simply\r\nreproduce, the \"Whiteboys\" of 1760; and the domination of the \"uncrowned\r\nking\" constantly reminds one of Froude's vivid and vigorous sketch of\r\nthe sway wielded by \"Captain Dwyer\" and \"Joanna Maskell\" from Mallow to\r\nWestmeath, between the years 1762 and 1765. On that side of the quarrel\r\nthere seems to be nothing very new under the sun in Ireland. But the\r\nspirit and the forms of the Imperial authority over the country have\r\nunquestionably undergone a great change for the better, not only since\r\nthe last century, but since the accession of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nUpon the question of land improvements, Mr. Stacpoole told me, to-night,\r\nthat he borrowed £1000 of the Government for drainage improvements on\r\nhis property here, the object of which was to better the holdings of\r\ntenants. Of this sum he had to leave £400 undrawn, as he could not get\r\nthe men to work at the improvements, even for their own good. They all\r\nwanted to be gangers or chiefs. It reminded me of Berlioz's reply to the\r\nbourgeois who wanted his son to be made a \"great composer.\" \"Let him go\r\ninto the army,\" said Berlioz, \"and join the only regiment he is fit\r\nfor.\" \"What regiment is that?\" \"The regiment of colonels.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening a report was brought out from Ennis to\r\nColonel Turner. He read it, and then handed it to me, with an\r\naccompanying document. The latter, at my request, he allowed me to keep,\r\nand I must reproduce it here. It tells its own tale.\r\n\r\nA peasant came to the authorities and complained that he was \"tormented\"\r\nto make a subscription to a \"testimonial\" for one Austen Mackay of\r\nKilshanny, in the County Clare, producing at the same time a copy of the\r\ncircular which had been sent about to the people. It is a\r\ncheaply-printed leaflet, not unlike a penny ballad in appearance, and\r\nthus it runs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Testimonial to_ Mr. AUSTEN MACKAY, _Kilshanny_, _County Clare_.\r\n\r\n\"We, the Nationalists and friends of Mr. Austen Mackay, at a meeting\r\nheld in March 1887, agreed and resolved on presenting the long-tried and\r\ntrusted friend--the persecuted widow's son--with a testimonial worthy of\r\nthe fearless hero who on several occasions had to hide his head in the\r\ncaves and caverns of the mountains, with a price set on his body. First,\r\nfor firing at and wounding a spy in his neighbourhood, as was alleged\r\nin '65, for which he had to stand his trial at Clare Assizes. Again, for\r\nfiring at and wounding his mother's agent and under-strapper while in\r\nthe act of evicting his widowed mother in the broad daylight of Heaven,\r\nthus saved his mother's home from being wrecked by the robber agent, the\r\nshock of which saved other hearths from being quenched; but the noble\r\nwidow's son was chased to the mountains, where he had to seek shelter\r\nfrom a thousand bloodhounds.\r\n\r\n\"The same true widow's son nobly guarded his mother's homestead and that\r\nof others from the foul hands of the exterminators. This is the same\r\nwidow's son who bravely reinstated the evicted, and helped to rebuild\r\nthe levelled houses of many; for this he was persecuted and convicted at\r\nCork Assizes, and flung into prison to sleep on the cold plank beds of\r\nCork and Limerick gaols. Many other manly and noble services did he\r\nwhich cannot be made known to the public. At that meeting you were\r\nappointed collector with other Nationalists of Clare at home and abroad.\r\nThis is the widow's son, Austen Mackay, whom we, the Committee to this\r\ntestimonial, hope and trust every Irishman in Clare will cheerfully\r\nsubscribe, that he may be enabled in his present state of health to get\r\ninto some business under the protection of the Stars and Stripes, where\r\nhe is a citizen of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subscriptions to be sent to Henry Higgins, Ennis.\r\n\r\n\"Treasurers: Daniel O'Loghlen, Lisdoonvarna; James Kennedy, Ennistymon.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow, with the name of the Society, the names of the committee.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the Stars and Stripes, \"where he is a citizen of,\" I thanked\r\nColonel Turner for this interesting contribution to the possible future\r\nhistory of my country, there being nothing to prevent the election of\r\nany heir of this illustrious \"widow's son,\" born to him in America, to\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic. The use of this phrase, the \"widow's\r\nson,\" by the way, gives a semi-masonic character to this curious\r\ncircular.\r\n\r\nOne officer says in his report upon this Committee: \"All the persons\r\nnamed are well known to their respective local police, and, except one,\r\nhave little or no following or influence in their respective localities.\r\nThey are all members of the National League.\" The same officer subjoins\r\nthis instructive observation: \"I beg to add that I find no matter how\r\npopular a man may be in Clare, start a testimonial for him, and from\r\nthat time forth his influence is gone.\"\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that the \"testimonial,\" which, as the papers tell me,\r\nis getting up all over Ireland for Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, can have been\r\n\"started\" with a sinister eye to this effect, by local patriots jealous\r\nof any alien intrusion into their bailiwick? I am almost tempted to\r\nsuspect this, remembering that a Nationalist with whom I talked about\r\nMr. Blunt in Dublin, after lavishing much praise upon his disinterested\r\ndevotion to the cause of Ireland, moodily remarked, \"For all that, I\r\ndon't believe he will do us any good, for he comes of the blood of\r\nMountjoy, I am told!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEDENVALE, _Monday, Feb. 20._--This morning Colonel Turner called my\r\nattention to the report in the papers of a colloquy between the Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland and Mr. J. Redmond, M.P., in the House, on the\r\nsubject of last week's trials at Ennis. In speaking of the boycotting at\r\nMilltown Malbay of a certain Mrs. Connell, Mr. Balfour described the\r\ncase as one of barbarous inhumanity shown to a helpless old woman. Mr.\r\nRedmond denying this, asserted that he had seen the woman Connell a\r\nfortnight ago in Court, and that so far from her being a decrepit old\r\nwoman, she was only fifty years of age, hale and hearty, but\r\ndisreputable and given to drink; he also said she was drunk at the\r\ntrial, so drunk that the Crown prosecutor, Mr. Otter, was obliged to\r\norder her down from the table.\r\n\r\n\"What are the facts?\" I asked. \"Mr. Balfour speaks from report and\r\nbelief, Mr. Redmond asserts that he speaks from actual observation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The facts,\" said Colonel Turner quietly, \"are that Mr. Balfour's\r\nstatement is accurate, and that Mr. Redmond, speaking from actual\r\nobservation, asserts the thing that is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is this old woman?\" I asked. \"Would it be possible for me to see\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; she is at no great distance, and I will with pleasure send a\r\ncar with an officer to bring her here this afternoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, how came the old woman into Court? and what is her\r\nconnection with the cases of boycotting last week tried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those cases arose out of her case,\" said Colonel Turner; \"the publicans\r\nlast week arraigned, 'boycotted' a fortnight ago the police and\r\nsoldiers who were called in to keep the peace during the trial of the\r\ndealers who 'boycotted' her.\r\n\r\n\"Her case was first publicly made known by a letter which appeared in\r\nthe Dublin _Express_ on the 28th of January. That day a line was sent to\r\nme from Dublin ordering an inquiry into it. I endorsed upon the order,\r\n'Please report. I imagine this is greatly exaggerated.' This was on\r\nJanuary 30th. The next day, January 31st, I received a full report from\r\nMilltown Malbay. Here it is,\"--taking a document from a portfolio and\r\nhanding it to me--\"and you may make what use you like of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth giving at length:--\r\n\r\n    \"James Connell, ex-soldier, and his mother, Hannah Connell, of\r\n    Fintamore, in this sub-district are boycotted, and have been since\r\n    July last. James Connell held a farm and a garden from one Michael\r\n    Carroll, a farmer, who was evicted from his holding for non-payment\r\n    of three years' rent, July 14, 1886. After the period of redemption,\r\n    six months, had passed, the agent made Connell a tenant for his\r\n    house and garden, giving him in addition about half an acre (Irish)\r\n    of the evicted farm which adjoins his house. In consequence Connell\r\n    was regarded by the National League here as a 'land-grabber.' About\r\n    the same time the agent also appointed him a rent-warner.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 22d June last Connell received a letter through the\r\n    Post-Office threatening him if he did not give up his place as a\r\n    rent-warner. I have no doubt the letter was written by (here a\r\n    resident was named). On the 10th, and again on the 17th, of July,\r\n    Connell was brought before indoor meetings of the National League\r\n    here for having taken the half acre of land, when he through fear\r\n    declared he had not done it.\r\n\r\n    \"At the first meeting the Rev. J.S. White, P.P., suggested that in\r\n    order to test whether Connell had taken the land, Carroll, the\r\n    evicted tenant, should go and cut the meadowing on it, which he did,\r\n    when Connell interfered and prevented him. At the next meeting\r\n    Carroll brought this under notice, and Connell was thereupon\r\n    boycotted. Immediately afterwards the men who had been engaged\r\n    fishing for Connell refused to fish, saying that if they fished for\r\n    him the sale of the fish would be boycotted, which was true.\r\n\r\n    \"Since then Connell has been deprived of his means of livelihood,\r\n    and no one dare employ him. He, however, through his mother, was\r\n    able to procure the necessaries of life until about the 22d of\r\n    November last, when his mother was refused goods by the tradesmen\r\n    with whom she had dealt, owing to a resolution passed at a meeting\r\n    of the 'suppressed' branch of the League here, to the effect that\r\n    any person supplying her would be boycotted. December 23d she came\r\n    into Milltown Malbay for goods, and was refused. The police\r\n    accompanied her, but no person would supply her. On the 2d of\r\n    January she came again, when one trader supplied her with some\r\n    bread, but refused groceries. The police accompanied her to several\r\n    traders, who all refused. Ultimately she was supplied by the\r\n    post-mistress. On the 7th of January she came, and the police\r\n    accompanied her to several traders, all of whom refused her even\r\n    bread. Believing she wanted it badly, we, the police, supplied her\r\n    with some. On these three occasions she was followed by large\r\n    numbers of young people about the street, evidently to frighten and\r\n    intimidate her, and their demeanour was so hostile that we were\r\n    obliged to disperse them and protect her home. On a subsequent\r\n    occasion she stated that stones were thrown at her. Since then she\r\n    has not come here for goods, and, in my opinion, it would not be\r\n    safe for her to do so without protection. She and her son are now\r\n    getting goods from Mrs. Moroney's shop at Spanish Point, which she\r\n    opened a few years ago to supply boycotted persons.\r\n\r\n    \"The Connells find it hard to get turf, and are obliged to bring it\r\n    a distance in bags so that it may not be observed. As for milk, the\r\n    person who did supply them privately for a considerable time\r\n    declined some weeks ago to do so any longer. They are now really\r\n    destitute, as any little money Connell had saved is spent, and,\r\n    although willing and anxious to work, no person will employ him.\r\n    Summonses have been issued against the tradesmen for refusing to\r\n    supply Hannah Connell on the occasions already referred to. I have\r\n    only to add that I have from time to time reported fully the\r\n    foregoing facts with regard to the persecution of this poor man and\r\n    his aged mother; and I regret to say that boycotting and\r\n    intimidation never prevailed to a greater extent here than at\r\n    present. Connell's safety is being looked after by patrols from this\r\n    and Spanish Point station.\"\r\n\r\nThree things seem to me specially noteworthy in this tale of cowardly\r\nand malignant tyranny. The victims of this vulgar Vehmgericht are\r\nneither landlords nor agents. They are a poor Irish labourer and his\r\naged mother. The \"crime\" for which these poor creatures are thus\r\npersecuted is simply that one of them--the man--chose to obey the law of\r\nthe land in which he lives, and to work for his livelihood and that of\r\nhis mother. And the priest of the parish, instead of sheltering and\r\nprotecting these hunted creatures, is presented as joining in the hunt,\r\nand actually devising a trap to catch the poor frightened man in a\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nUpon this third point, a correspondence which passed between Father\r\nWhite and Colonel Turner, after the conviction of the boycotters of Mrs.\r\nConnell, and copies of which the latter has handed to me at my request,\r\nthrows an instructive light.\r\n\r\nWhen the report of January 31st reached him, Colonel Turner ordered the\r\ntradespeople implicated in the persecution to be proceeded against. Six\r\nof them were put on their trials on the 3d and 4th of February. All the\r\nshops in Milltown Malbay were closed, by order of the local League,\r\nduring the trial, and the police and the soldiers called in were refused\r\nall supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th, one of the persons arraigned was bound over for\r\nintimidation, and the five others were sentenced to three months'\r\nimprisonment with hard labour.\r\n\r\nA week later, February 11th, Colonel Turner addressed the following\r\nletter to Father White, twenty-six publicans of Milltown Malbay having\r\nmeanwhile been prosecuted for boycotting the police and the soldiers:--\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR SIR,--I write to you as a clergyman who possesses great\r\n    influence with the people in your part of the country, to put it to\r\n    you whether it would not be better for the interests of all\r\n    concerned if the contemptible system of petty persecution, called\r\n    boycotting, were put an end to in and about Milltown Malbay, which\r\n    would enable me to drop prosecutions. If it is not put a stop to, I\r\n    am determined to stamp it out, and restore to all the ordinary\r\n    rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n    \"But I should very greatly prefer that the people should stop it\r\n    themselves, and save me from taking strong measures, which I should\r\n    deplore. The story of a number of men combining to persecute a poor\r\n    old woman is one of the most pitiful I ever heard.--I am, sir, yours\r\n    truly,\r\n\r\n    ALFRED TURNER.\"\r\n\r\nAs the cost of the extra policemen sent to Milltown Malbay at this time\r\nfalls upon the people there, this letter in effect offered the priest an\r\nopportunity to relieve his parish of a burden as well as to redeem its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe next day Father White replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR SIR,--No one living is more anxious for peace in this district\r\n    than I. During very exciting times I have done my best to keep it\r\n    free from outrage, and with success, except in one mysterious\r\n    instance.[20] There is but one obstacle to it now. If ever you can\r\n    advise Mrs. Moroney to restore the evicted tenant, whose rent you\r\n    admitted was as high as Colonel O'Callaghan's, I can guarantee on\r\n    the part of the people the return of good feelings; or, failing\r\n    that, if she and her employees are content with the goods which she\r\n    has of all kinds in her own shop, there need be no further trouble.\r\n\r\n    \"I have a promise from the people that the police will be supplied\r\n    for the future. This being so, if you will kindly have prosecutions\r\n    withdrawn, or even postponed for say a month, it will very much\r\n    strengthen me in the effort I am making to calm down the feeling.\r\n    Regarding Mrs. Connell, the head-constable was told by me that she\r\n    was to get goods, and she did get bread, till the police went round\r\n    with her. This upset my arrangements, as I had induced the people to\r\n    give her what she might really want. In fact she was a convenience\r\n    to Mrs. Moroney for obvious reasons, and her son is now in her\r\n    employment in place of Kelly, who has been dismissed since his very\r\n    inconvenient evidence. It is, and was, well known they were not\r\n    starving as they said, they having a full supply of their accustomed\r\n    food.--Thanking you for your great courtesy, I am, dear sir, truly\r\n    yours,\r\n\r\n    \"J. White.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Colonel Turner replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"My dear Sir,--We cannot adjourn the cases. But if those who are\r\n    prosecuted are prepared to make reparation by promising future good\r\n    conduct in Court, I can then see my way to interfere, and to prevent\r\n    them from suffering imprisonment.\r\n\r\n    \"These cases have nothing whatever to do with Mrs. Moroney.[21] They\r\n    are simply between the defendants and the police and other\r\n    officials, who were at Milltown Malbay that day. I am greatly\r\n    pleased at your evident wish to co-operate with me in calming down\r\n    the ill-feeling which unfortunately exists, and I am satisfied that\r\n    success will attend our efforts.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday and Friday last, as I have recorded, the cases came on of\r\nthe twenty-six publicans charged. Between February 4th, when the\r\noffences were committed, and the 17th of February, one of these\r\npublicans had died, one had fled to America, and there proved to be an\r\ninformality in the summons issued against a third. Twenty-three only\r\nwere put upon their trial. As I have stated, one was acquitted and the\r\nothers were found guilty, and sentenced to be imprisoned. In accordance\r\nwith his promise made to Father White, Colonel Turner offered to relieve\r\nthem all of the imprisonment if they would sign an undertaking in Court\r\nnot to repeat the offence. Ten, the most prosperous and substantial of\r\nthe accused, accepted this offer and signed, as has been already stated.\r\nOne, a woman, was discharged without being required to sign the\r\nguarantee, the other eleven refused to sign, and were sent to prison.\r\nFather White, whose own evidence given at the trial, as his letter to\r\nColonel Turner would lead one to expect, had gone far to prove the\r\nexistence of the conspiracy, encouraged the eleven in their attitude.\r\n\r\nThis was his way of \"co-operating\" with Colonel Turner to \"calm down the\r\nill-feeling which exists\"!\r\n\r\nDuring the morning Mrs. Stacpoole sent for the clerk and manager of the\r\nestate, and asked him to show me the books. He is a native of these\r\nparts, by name Considine, and has lived at Edenvale for eighteen years.\r\nIn his youth he went out to America, but there found out that he had a\r\n\"liver,\" an unpleasant discovery, which led him to return to the land of\r\nhis birth, and to the service of Mr. Stacpoole. He is perfectly familiar\r\nwith the condition of the country here, and as the accounts of this\r\nestate are kept minutely and carefully from week to week, he was able\r\nthis morning to show me the current prices of all kinds of farm produce\r\nand of supplies in and about Ennis--not estimated prices, but prices\r\nactually paid or received in actual transactions during the last ten\r\nyears. I am surprised to see how narrow has been the range of local\r\nvariations during that time; and I find Mr. Considine inclined to think\r\nthat the farmers here have suffered very little, if at all, from these\r\nfluctuations, making up from time to time on their reduced expenses what\r\nthey have lost through lessened receipts. The expenses of the landlord\r\nhave however increased, while his receipts have fallen off. In 1881\r\nEdenvale paid out for labour £466, 0s. 1-1/2d., in 1887 £560, 6s.\r\n3-1/2d., though less labour was employed in 1887 than in 1881. The wages\r\nof servants, where any change appears, have risen. In 1881 a gardener\r\nreceived £14 a year, in 1888 he receives 15s. a week, or at the rate of\r\n£39 a year. A housemaid receiving £12 a year in 1881, receives now £17 a\r\nyear. A butler receiving in 1881 £26 a year, now receives £40 a year. A\r\nkitchen maid receiving in 1881 £6, now receives £10, 10s. a year.\r\nMeanwhile, the Sub-Commissioners are at this moment cutting down the\r\nEdenvale rents again by £190, 3s. 2d., after a walk over the property in\r\nthe winter. Yet in July 1883 Mr. Reeves, for the Sub-Commission,\r\n\"thought it right to say there was no estate in the County Clare so\r\nfairly rented, to their knowledge, or where the tenants had less cause\r\nfor complaint.\" In but one case was a reduction of any magnitude made by\r\nthe Commission of 1883, and in one case that Commission actually\r\nincreased the rent from £11, 10s. to £16. In January 1883 the rental of\r\nthis property was £4065, 5s. 1d. The net reduction made by the\r\nCommissioners in July 1883 was £296, 14s. 0-1/2d.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon a car came up to the mansion, bringing a stalwart,\r\ngood-natured-looking sergeant of police, and with him the boycotted old\r\nwoman Mrs. Connell and her son. The sergeant helped the old woman down\r\nvery tenderly, and supported her into the house. She came in with some\r\ntrepidation and uneasiness, glancing furtively all about her, with the\r\nlook of a hunted creature in her eyes. Her son, who followed her, was\r\nmore at his ease, but he also had a worried and careworn look. Both were\r\nwarmly but very poorly clad, and both worn and weatherbeaten of aspect.\r\nThe old woman might have passed anywhere for a witch, so wizened and\r\nweird she was, of small stature, and bent nearly double by years and\r\nrheumatism. Her small hands were withered away into claws, and her head\r\nwas covered with a thick and tangled mat of hair, half dark, half grey,\r\nwhich gave her the look almost of the Fuegian savages who come off from\r\nthe shore in their flat rafts and clamour to you for \"rum\" in the\r\nStraits of Magellan. Her eyes were intensely bright, and shone like hot\r\ncoals in her dusky, wrinkled face. It was a raw day, and she came in\r\nshivering with the cold. It was pathetic to see how she positively\r\ngloated with extended palms over the bright warm, fire in the\r\ndrawing-room, and clutched at the cup of hot tea which my kind hostess\r\ninstantly ordered in for her.\r\n\r\nThis was the woman of whom Mr. Redmond wrote to Mr. Parnell that she was\r\n\"an active strong dame of about fifty.\" When Mr. Balfour, in Parliament,\r\ndescribed her truly as a \"decrepit old woman of eighty,\" Mr. Redmond\r\ncontradicted him, and accused her of being \"the worse for liquor\" in a\r\npublic court.\r\n\r\n\"How old is your mother?\" I asked her son.\r\n\r\n\"I am not rightly sure, sir,\" he replied, \"but she is more than eighty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man himself is about fifty,\" said the sergeant; \"he volunteered to\r\ngo to the Crimean War, and that was more than thirty years ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did indeed, sir,\" broke in the man, \"and it was from Cork I went. And\r\nI'd be a corpse now if it wasn't for the mercy of God and the\r\nprotection. God bless the police, sir, that protected my old mother,\r\nsir, and me. That Mr. Redmond, sir, they read me what he said, and sure\r\nhe should be ashamed of his shadow, to get up there in Parliament, and\r\ntell those lies, sir, about my old mother!\" I questioned Connell as to\r\nhis relations with Carroll, the man who brought him before the League.\r\nHe was a labourer holding a bit of ground under Carroll. Carroll refused\r\nto pay his own rent to the landlord. But he compelled Connell to pay\r\nrent to him. When Carroll was evicted, the landlord offered to let\r\nConnell have half an acre more of land. He took it to better himself,\r\nand \"how did he injure Carroll by taking it?\" How indeed, poor man! Was\r\nhe a rent-warner? Yes; he earned something that way two or three times\r\na year; and for that he had to ask the protection of the police--\"they\r\nwould kill him else.\" What with worry and fright, and the loss of his\r\nlivelihood, this unfortunate labourer has evidently been broken down\r\nmorally and physically. It is impossible to come into contact with such\r\nliving proofs of the ineffable cowardice and brutality of this business\r\nof \"boycotting\" without indignation and disgust.\r\n\r\nWhile Connell was telling his pitiful tale a happy thought occurred to\r\nthe charming daughter of the house. Mrs. Stacpoole is a clever amateur\r\nin photography. \"Why not photograph this 'hale and hearty woman of\r\nfifty,' with her son of fifty-three?\" Mrs. Stacpoole clapped her hands\r\nat the idea, and went off at once to prepare her apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhile she was gone the sergeant gave me an account of the trial, which\r\nMr. Redmond, M.P., witnessed. He was painfully explicit. \"Mr. Redmond\r\nknew the woman was sober,\" he said; \"she was lifted up on the table at\r\nMr. Redmond's express request, because she was so small and old, and\r\nspoke in such a low voice that he could not hear what she said. Connell\r\nhad always been a decent, industrious fellow--a fisherman. But for the\r\nlady, Mrs. Moroney, he and his mother would have starved, and would\r\nstarve now. As for the priest, Father White, Connell went to him to ask\r\nhis intercession and help, but he could get neither.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant had heard Father White preach yesterday. \"It was a curious\r\nsermon. He counselled peace and forbearance to the people, because they\r\nmight be sure the wicked Tory Government would very soon fall!\"\r\n\r\nPresently the sun came out with golden glow, and with the sun came out\r\nMrs. Stacpoole. It was a job to \"pose\" the subjects, the old woman\r\nevidently suspecting some surgical or legal significance in the\r\nmachinery displayed, and her son finding some trouble in making her\r\nunderstand what it meant. But finally we got the tall, personable\r\nsergeant, with his frank, shrewd, sensible face, to put himself between\r\nthe two, in the attitude as of a guardian angel; the camera was nimbly\r\nadjusted, and lo! the thing was done.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stacpoole thinks the operation promises a success. I suppose it\r\nwould hardly be civil to send a finished proof of the group to Mr. J.\r\nRedmond, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE AND THE AMERICAN WAR. (Prologue, p. xxix.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement as to the action of Lord Palmerston in connection with\r\nMr. Gladstone's Newcastle speech of October 7th, 1862, made upon the\r\nauthority of a British public man whose years and position entitle him\r\nto speak with confidence on such a subject, appeared to me of so much\r\ninterest, that after sending it to the printer I caused search to be\r\nmade for the speech referred to as made by Sir George Cornewall Lewis.\r\nMy informant's statement was that Lord Palmerston insisted that Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis should find or make an immediate opportunity of covering\r\nwhat Mr. Gladstone had said at Newcastle. He was angry about it, and his\r\nanger was increased by an article which Mr. Delane printed in the\r\n_Times_, intimating that Mr. Gladstone's speech was considered by many\r\npeople to be a betrayal of Cabinet secrets. Sir George Lewis was far\r\nfrom well (he died the next spring), and reluctant to do what his chief\r\nwished; but he did it on the 17th of October 1862 in a speech at\r\nHereford. Mr. Milner-Gibson was also put forward to the same end, and\r\nafter Parliament met, in February 1863, Mr. Disraeli gave the\r\nGovernment a sharp lashing for sending one or two Ministers into the\r\ncountry in the recess to announce that the Southern States would be\r\nrecognised, and then putting forward the President of the Board of Trade\r\n(Milner-Gibson) to attack the Southern States and the pestilent\r\ninstitution of slavery. Mr. Gladstone's speech at Newcastle, coming as\r\nit did from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after the close of a\r\nsession during which everybody knew that the Emperor of the French had\r\nbeen urging upon England the recognition of the Confederate States, and\r\nthat Mr. Mason had been in active correspondence on that subject with\r\nLord Russell, was taken at Newcastle, and throughout the country, to\r\nmean that the recognition was imminent. Mr. Gladstone even went so far\r\nas to say he rather rejoiced that the Confederates had not been able to\r\nhold Maryland, as that might have made them aggressive, and so made a\r\nsettlement more difficult, it being, he said, as certain as anything in\r\nthe future could be that the South must succeed in separating itself\r\nfrom the Union. This remark about Maryland distinctly indicated\r\nconsultation as to what limits and boundaries between the South and the\r\nNorth should be recognised in the recognition, and on that account, it\r\nseems, was particularly resented by Earl Russell as well as by Lord\r\nPalmerston.\r\n\r\nSir George Cornewall Lewis's speech of October 17, 1862, was a most\r\nskilful and masterly attempt to protect the Cabinet against the\r\nconsequences of what the _Times_, on the 9th of October, had treated as\r\nthe \"indiscretion or treason\" of his colleague. But it did not save the\r\nGovernment from the scourge of Mr. Disraeli, or much mitigate the effect\r\nin America of Mr. Gladstone's performance at Newcastle, which was a much\r\nmore serious matter from the American point of view than any of the\r\nspeeches recently delivered about \"Home Rule\" in the American Senate\r\ncan be fairly said to be from the British point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B.\r\n\r\nMR. PARNELL AND THE DYNAMITERS. (Prologue, p. xxxiii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of Mr. Parnell and his Parliamentary associates to what is\r\ncalled the extreme and \"criminal\" section of the Irish American\r\nRevolutionary Party can only be understood by those who understand that\r\nit is the ultimate object of this party not to effect reforms in the\r\nadministration of Ireland as an integral part of the British Empire, but\r\nto sever absolutely the political connection between Ireland and the\r\nBritish Empire. Loyal British subjects necessarily consider this object\r\na \"criminal\" object, just as loyal Austrian subjects considered the\r\nobject of the Italian Revolutionists of 1848 to be a \"criminal\" object.\r\nBut the Italian Revolutionists of 1848 did not accept this view of their\r\nobject. On the contrary, they held their end to be so high and holy that\r\nit more or less sanctified even assassination when planned as a means to\r\nthat end. Why should the Italian Revolutionists of 1848 be judged by one\r\nstandard and the Irish Revolutionists of 1888 by another?\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Parnell and his Parliamentary associates were to declare in\r\nunequivocal terms their absolute loyalty to the British Crown, and their\r\ndetermination to maintain in all circumstances the political connection\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, they might or might not retain their\r\nhold upon Mr. Davitt and upon their constituents in Ireland, but they\r\nwould certainly put themselves beyond the pale of support by the great\r\nIrish American organisations. Nor do I believe they could retain the\r\nconfidence of those organisations if it were supposed that they really\r\nregarded the most extreme and violent of the Irish Revolutionists, the\r\n\"Invincibles\" and the \"dynamiters\" as \"criminals,\" in the sense in which\r\nthe \"Invincibles\" and the \"dynamiters\" are so regarded by the rest of\r\nthe civilised world. Can it, for example, be doubted that any English or\r\nScottish public man who co-operates with Mr. Parnell and his\r\nParliamentary associates would instantly hand over to the police any\r\n\"Invincible\" or \"dynamiter\" who might come within his reach? And can it\r\nfor a moment be believed that Mr. Parnell, or any one of his\r\nParliamentary associates, would do this? There are thousands of Irish\r\ncitizens in the United States who felt all the horror and indignation\r\nexpressed by Mr. Parnell at the murders in the Phoenix Park, but I\r\nshould be very much surprised to learn that any one of them all ever\r\ndid, or ever would do, anything likely to bring any one of the authors\r\nof these murders to the bar of justice. Mr. Parnell and his\r\nParliamentary associates are held and bound by the essential conditions\r\nof their political existence to treat with complaisance the most extreme\r\nand violent men of their party. Nor is this true of them alone.\r\n\r\nThere is no more respectable body of men in the United States than the\r\nHibernian Society of Philadelphia. This society was instituted in 1771,\r\nfive years before the declaration of American Independence. It is a\r\ncharitable and social organisation only, with no political object or\r\ncolour. It is made up of men of character and substance. Its custom has\r\nalways been to celebrate St. Patrick's Day by a banquet, to which the\r\nmost distinguished men of the country have repeatedly been bidden.\r\nImmediately after the inauguration of Mr. Cleveland as President, on\r\nthe 4th of March 1885, Mr. Bayard, the new Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States, was invited by this Society to attend its one hundred and\r\nfourteenth banquet. It will be remembered that, on the 30th of May 1884,\r\nLondon had been startled and shocked by an explosion of dynamite in St.\r\nJames's Square, which shattered many houses and inflicted cruel injuries\r\nupon several innocent people. It was not so fatal to life as that\r\nexplosion at the Salford Barracks, which Mr. Parnell treated as a\r\n\"practical joke.\" But it excited lively indignation on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, and Mr. Bayard, who at that time was a Senator of the United\r\nStates, sternly denounced it and its authors on the floor of the\r\nAmerican Senate. What he had said as a Senator he thought it right to\r\nrepeat as the Foreign Secretary of the United States in his reply to the\r\ninvitation of the Hibernian Society in March 1885. This reply ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"WASHINGTON, D.C., _March_ 9, 1885.\r\n\r\n    \"NICHOLAS J. GRIFFIN, Esq., _Secretary of the Hibernian Society of\r\n    Philadelphia._\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,--I have your personal note accompanying the card of\r\n    invitation to dine with your ancient and honourable Society on their\r\n    one hundred and fourteenth anniversary, St. Patrick's Day, and I\r\n    sincerely regret that I cannot accept it. The obvious and many\r\n    duties of my public office here speak for themselves, and to none\r\n    with more force than to American citizens of Irish blood or birth\r\n    who are honestly endeavouring to secure liberty by maintaining a\r\n    government of laws, and who realise the constant attention that is\r\n    needful.\r\n\r\n    \"In the midst of anarchical demonstrations which we witness in other\r\n    lands, and the echoes of which we can detect even here in our own\r\n    free country, where base and silly individuals seek to stain the\r\n    name of Ireland by associating the honest struggle for just\r\n    government with senseless and wicked crimes, there are none of our\r\n    citizens from whom honest reprobation can be more confidently\r\n    expected than from such as compose your respected and benevolent\r\n    Society. Those who worthily celebrate the birthday[22] of St.\r\n    Patrick will not forget that he drove out of Ireland the reptiles\r\n    that creep and sting.\r\n\r\n    \"The Hibernian Society can contain no member who will not resent the\r\n    implication that sympathy with assassins can dwell in a genuine\r\n    Irish heart, which will ever be opposed to cruelty and cowardice,\r\n    whatever form either may take.\r\n\r\n    \"Present to your Society my thanks for the kind remembrance, and\r\n    assure them of the good-will and respect with which I am--Your\r\n    obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    T.F. BAYARD.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the response of this Society, representing all the best\r\nelements of the Irish American population of the United States, to this\r\nletter of the Secretary of State, the highest executive officer of the\r\nAmerican Government after the President, upon whom under an existing law\r\nthe succession of the chief magistracy now devolves in the event of the\r\ndeath or disability of the President and the Vice-President?\r\n\r\n_The letter was not read at the banquet._\r\n\r\nBut it was given to the press by the officers of the Society, and the\r\nmost influential Irish American newspaper in the United States did not\r\nhesitate to describe it as an \"insulting letter,\" going to show that its\r\nauthor was \"an Englishman in spirit who will not allow any opportunity\r\nto go by, however slight, without testifying his sympathy with the\r\nBritish Empire and his antipathy for its foes.\"\r\n\r\nThis was capped by an American political journal which used the\r\nfollowing language: \"Lord Granville himself would hardly strike a more\r\nviolent attitude against the dynamite section of the Irish people. When\r\nLord Wolseley, whom it is proposed to make Governor-General of the\r\nSoudan, is offering a reward for the head of Ollivier Pain, it is hardly\r\nin good taste for an American Secretary of State to condemn so bitterly\r\na class of Irishmen which, while it includes bad men no doubt, also\r\nincludes men who are moved by as worthy motives as Lord Wolseley.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of this testimony to the \"solidarity\" of all branches of the\r\nIrish revolutionary movement in America, how can Mr. Parnell, or any\r\nother Parliamentary Irishman who depends upon Irish American support, be\r\nexpected by men of sense to condemn in earnest \"the dynamite section of\r\nthe Irish people\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN \"SUSPECTS\" OF 1881. (Prologue, p. xlvii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his recently published and very interesting _Life of Mr. Forster_,\r\nMr. Wemyss Reid alludes to some action taken by the United States\r\nGovernment in the spring of 1882 as one of the determining forces which\r\nbrought about the abandonment at that time by Mr. Gladstone of Mr.\r\nForster's policy in Ireland. Without pretending to concern myself here\r\nwith what is an essentially British question as between Mr. Forster and\r\nMr. Gladstone, it may be both proper and useful for me to throw some\r\nlight, not, perhaps, in the possession of Mr. Reid, upon the part taken\r\nin this matter by the American Government. Sir William Harcourt's\r\n\"Coercion Bill\" was passed on the 2d of March 1881, two days before the\r\ninauguration of General Garfield as President of the United States. Mr.\r\nBlaine, who was appointed by the new President to take charge of the\r\nForeign Relations of the American Government, received, on the 10th of\r\nMarch, at Washington, a despatch written by Mr. Lowell, the American\r\nMinister in London, on the 26th of February, being the day after the\r\nthird reading in the Commons of the \"Coercion Bill.\" In this despatch\r\nMr. Lowell called the attention of the American State Department to a\r\nletter from Mr. Parnell to the Irish National Land League, dated at\r\nParis, February 13, 1881, in which Mr. Parnell attempted to make what\r\nMr. Lowell accurately enough described as an \"extraordinary\" distinction\r\nbetween \"the American people\" and \"the Irish nation in America.\"\r\n\r\n\"This double nationality,\" said Mr. Lowell, \"is likely to be of great\r\npractical inconvenience whenever the 'Coercion Bill' becomes law.\" By\r\n\"this double nationality\" in this passage, the American Minister, of\r\ncourse, meant \"this claim of a double nationality;\" for neither by Great\r\nBritain nor by the United States is any man permitted to consider\r\nhimself at one and the same time a citizen of the American republic and\r\na subject of the British monarchy. Nor was he quite right in\r\nanticipating \"great practical inconvenience\" from this \"claim,\" upon\r\nwhich neither the British nor the American Government for a moment\r\nbestowed, or could bestow, the slightest attention.\r\n\r\nThe \"great practical inconvenience\" which, first to the American\r\nLegation in England, then to the United States Government at Washington,\r\nand finally to the Cabinet of Mr. Gladstone, did, however, arise from\r\nthe application of Sir William Harcourt's Coercion Act of 1881 to\r\nAmerican citizens in Ireland, had its origin not in Mr. Parnell's\r\npreposterous idea of an Irish nationality existing in the United States,\r\nbut in the failure of the authorities of the United States to deal\r\npromptly and firmly with the situation created for American citizens in\r\nIreland by the administration of Sir William Harcourt's Act.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, Sir William Harcourt's Act became law on the 2d of\r\nMarch 1881, two days before the inauguration of President Garfield at\r\nWashington. Without touching the question of the relations between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, and between the British Parliament and the Irish\r\nNational Land League, it was clearly incumbent upon the Secretary of\r\nState of the United States, who entered upon his duties three days after\r\nSir William Harcourt's Bill went into force in Ireland, to inform\r\nhimself minutely and exactly as to the possible effects of that Bill\r\nupon the rights and interests of American citizens travelling or\r\nsojourning in that country. This was due not only to his own Government\r\nand to its citizens, but to the relations which ought to exist between\r\nhis own Government and the Government of Great Britain. It was no affair\r\nof an American Secretary of State either to impede or to further the\r\nexecution of \"Coercion Acts\" in Ireland against British subjects. But it\r\nwas his affair to ascertain without delay the nature and the measure of\r\nany new and unusual perils, or \"inconveniences,\" to which American\r\ncitizens in Ireland might be exposed in the execution there by the\r\nBritish authorities of such Acts.\r\n\r\nAnd it is on record, under his own hand, in a despatch to the American\r\nMinister in London, dated May 26, 1881, that Mr. Blaine had not so much\r\nas seen a copy of Sir William Harcourt's Coercion Act at that date,\r\nthree months after it had gone into effect; three months after many\r\npersons claiming American citizenship had been arrested and imprisoned\r\nunder it; and two months after his own official attention had been\r\ncalled by the American Minister in London, in an elaborate despatch, to\r\nthe arrest under it of one such person, a man of Irish birth, who based\r\nhis claim of American citizenship upon allegations of military service\r\nduring the Civil War, of residence and citizenship in New York, and of\r\nthe granting to him, by an American Secretary of State, of a citizen's\r\npassport. And when he did finally take the trouble to look at this Act,\r\nMr. Elaine seems to have examined it so cursorily, and with such slight\r\nattention, that he overlooked a provision made in it, under which, had\r\nits true force and meaning been perceived by him, the State Department\r\nof the United States might, in the early summer of 1881, have secured\r\nfor American citizens in Ireland the consideration due to them as the\r\ncitizens of a friendly State. A curious despatch from Mr. Sackville\r\nWest, the British Minister at Washington, to Earl Granville, published\r\nin a British Blue-book now in my possession, plainly intimates that in\r\nthe summer of 1881 the American Secretary of State had given the British\r\nMinister to understand that no representations made to him or to his\r\nGovernment by the Government of the United States touching\r\nAmerican-Irish \"suspects\" need be taken at all seriously. The whole\r\ndiplomatic correspondence on this subject which went on between the two\r\nGovernments while Mr. Blaine was Secretary of State, from the 4th of\r\nMarch 1881 to the 20th of December 1881, was of a sort to lull the\r\nBritish Government into the belief that \"suspects\" might be freely and\r\nsafely arrested and locked up all over Ireland, with no more question of\r\ntheir nationality than of any evidence to establish their guilt or their\r\ninnocence. During the whole of that time the State Department at\r\nWashington seems to have substantially remained content with the\r\ndeclaration of Earl Granville, in a letter sent to the American Legation\r\non the 8th of July 1881, four months after the Coercion Act went into\r\neffect, that \"no distinction could be made in the circumstances between\r\nforeigners and British subjects, and that in the case of British\r\nsubjects the only information given was that contained in the warrant.\"\r\n\r\nNo fault can be found with the British Government for standing by this\r\ndeclaration so long as it thus seemed to command the assent of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Frelinghuysen was called into the State Department by\r\nPresident Arthur in December 1881, to overhaul the condition into which\r\nour foreign relations had been brought by his predecessor, he found that\r\nin no single instance had Mr. Blaine succeeded in inducing the British\r\nGovernment, either to release any American citizen arrested under a\r\ngeneral warrant without specific charges of criminal conduct, and on\r\n\"suspicion\" in Ireland, or to order the examination of any such citizen.\r\nThe one case in which an American citizen arrested under the Coercion\r\nAct in Ireland during Mr. Blaine's tenure of office had been liberated\r\nwhen Mr. Frelinghuysen took charge of the State Department, was that of\r\nMr. Joseph B. Walsh, arrested at Castlebar, in Mayo, March 8, 1881, and\r\ndischarged by order of the Lord-Lieutenant, October 21, 1881, not\r\nbecause he was an American citizen, nor after any examination, but\r\nexpressly and solely on the ground of ill-health.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Frelinghuysen became Secretary of State in December 1881 the\r\nCongress of the United States was in session. So numerous were the\r\nAmerican \"suspects\" then lying in prison in Ireland, some of whom had\r\nbeen so confined for many months, that the doors of Congress were soon\r\nbesieged by angry demands for an inquiry into the subject. A resolution\r\nin this sense was adopted by the House of Representatives, and\r\nforwarded, through the American Legation in London, to the British\r\nForeign Office. Memorials touching particular cases were laid before\r\nboth Houses of the American Congress. On the 10th of February 1882, Mr.\r\nBancroft Davis, the Assistant-Secretary of State, instructed the\r\nAmerican Minister at London to take action concerning one such case, and\r\nto report upon it. The Minister not moving more rapidly than he had been\r\naccustomed to do under Mr. Blaine, Mr. Davis grew impatient, and on the\r\n2d of March 1882 (being the anniversary of the adoption of the Coercion\r\nAct in England) the American Secretary of State cabled to the Minister\r\nin London significantly enough, \"Use all diligence in regard to the late\r\ncases, especially of Hart and M'Sweeney, and report by cable.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell replied the next day, giving the views in regard to Hart of\r\nthe American Vice-Consul, and of the British Inspector of Police at\r\nQueenstown, and adding an expression of his own opinion that neither\r\nHart nor M'Sweeney was \"more innocent than the majority of those under\r\narrest.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an unfortunate despatch. It roused the American Secretary of\r\nState into responding instantly by cable in the following explicit and\r\nemphatic terms: \"Referring to the cases of O'Connor, Hart, M'Sweeney,\r\nM'Enery, and D'Alton, American citizens imprisoned in Ireland, say to\r\nLord Granville that, without discussing whether the provisions of the\r\nForce Act can be applied to American citizens, the President hopes that\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant will be instructed to exercise the powers intrusted\r\nto him by the first section to order early trials in these and all other\r\ncases in which Americans may be arrested.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the tone of this despatch. It was instantly\r\ntransmitted to the British Foreign Secretary, who replied the same day\r\nthat \"the matter would receive the immediate attention of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference made to the Coercion Act by Mr. Frelinghuysen touched a\r\nplain and precise provision, that persons detained under the Act\r\n\"should not be discharged or tried by any court without the direction of\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant.\" Had the Coercion Act received from Mr. Blaine in\r\nMarch 1881 the attention bestowed upon it in March 1882 by Mr.\r\nFrelinghuysen, this provision might have been used to obviate the\r\ndangerous accumulation of injustice to individuals, and of international\r\nirritation, resulting from the application to possibly innocent foreign\r\ncitizens in Ireland of the despotic powers conferred by that Act upon\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government, powers as nearly as possible analogous with\r\nthose which Mr. Gladstone himself, years before, had denounced in\r\nunmeasured terms when they were claimed and exercised by the Government\r\nof Naples in dealing with its own subjects.\r\n\r\nAfter the consideration by Her Majesty's Government of this despatch of\r\nthe United States Government, it is understood in America that Mr.\r\nForster, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, was invited to communicate with\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant, and request him to exercise his discretion in the\r\nsense desired, and that Mr. Forster positively refused to do this.\r\n\r\nHow this may be I do not pretend to say. But as no satisfactory reply\r\nwas made to the American despatch, and as public feeling in the United\r\nStates grew daily more and more determined that a stop should be put to\r\nthe unexplained arrest and the indefinite detention of American citizens\r\nin Ireland, the American Secretary of State made up his mind towards the\r\nend of the month of March to repeat his despatch of March 3d in a more\r\nterse and peremptory form. As a final preliminary to this step, however,\r\nMr. Frelinghuysen was induced to avail himself of the unusual and\r\nofficious intervention of his most distinguished living predecessor in\r\nthe State Department, Mr. Hamilton Fish. After measuring the gravity of\r\nthe situation, Mr. Fish at the end of March sent a despatch to an\r\neminent public man, well known on both sides of the Atlantic, and now\r\nresident in London, with authority to show it personally to Mr.\r\nGladstone, to the effect that if any further delay occurred in complying\r\nwith the moderate and reasonable demand of the American Government for\r\nthe immediate release or the immediate trial of the American \"suspects,\"\r\nthe relations between Great Britain and the United States would be very\r\nseriously \"strained.\"\r\n\r\nThis despatch was at once communicated to Mr. Gladstone. Within the\r\nweek, the liberation was announced of six American \"suspects.\" Within a\r\nfortnight, Mr. Parnell, Mr. O'Kelly, and Mr. Dillon, it is understood,\r\nimprisoned members of Parliament, were offered their liberty if they\r\nwould consent to a sham exile on the Continent for a few weeks, or even\r\ndays; and within a month Mr. Forster, in his place in Parliament, was\r\nimputing to his late chief and Premier the negotiation of that\r\ncelebrated \"Treaty of Kilmainham,\" which was repudiated with equal\r\nwarmth by the three Irish members already named, and by Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE D.\r\n\r\nTHE PARNELLITES AND THE ENGLISH PARTIES.\r\n\r\n(Prologue, p. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I am not writing a history of English parties, I need not discuss\r\nhere the truth or falsehood of this contention. But I cannot let it pass\r\nwithout a word as to two cases which came under my own observation, and\r\nwhich aggravate the inherent improbability of the tale. In November 1885\r\nI went to America, and on my way passed through Stockport, where my\r\nfriend, Mr. Jennings, long my correspondent in England, was then\r\nstanding as a Conservative candidate. I attended one of his meetings and\r\nheard him make an effective speech, much applauded, which turned\r\nexclusively upon imperial and financial issues. That he had no\r\nunderstanding whatever with the \"managers\" of the Irish vote in\r\nStockport, I have the best reason to believe. But he was assured by them\r\nthat the Irish intended to vote for him; and at a subsequent time he was\r\nrashly assailed in the House of Commons by an Irish member with the\r\ncharge that he had broken faith with the Irish who elected him. It was\r\nan unlucky assault for the assailant, as it gave Mr. Jennings an\r\nopportunity, which he promptly improved, to show that he owed nothing to\r\nthe Irish voters of Stockport. Whether they voted for him in any number\r\nin 1885 was more than doubtful; while in 1886 they voted solidly against\r\nhim, with the result of swelling his majority from 369 to 518 votes.\r\n\r\nIn January 1886 I returned to Europe, and going on a visit into\r\nYorkshire, there met a prominent Irish Nationalist, who told me that he\r\nhad come into the north of England expressly to regiment the Irish\r\nvoters, and throw their votes for the Conservative candidates, on the\r\nground that it was necessary to make the Liberals fully understand their\r\npower. He had fully expected in this way to elect a Conservative member\r\nfor the city of York. Great was his chagrin, therefore, when he found\r\nthe Liberal candidate returned. Upon investigation he discovered, as he\r\ntold me, that the catastrophe was due to the activity of a local Irish\r\npriest, _who was a devoted Fenian_, utterly opposed to the Parliamentary\r\nprogramme, and who had exerted his authority over the local Irish to\r\nbring them to the polls for the Liberal candidate.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Milner, Bart., the defeated Conservative candidate for\r\nYork, afterwards told me that the local priest referred to here was a\r\nmost excellent man, and that so far from playing the part thus ascribed\r\nto him, he took the trouble, as a matter of fair dealing, to see his\r\nparishioners on the morning of the election and warn them against\r\nbelieving a pamphlet which was sedulously circulated among the Irish\r\nvoters on the night before the polling, with a message to the effect\r\nthat Sir Frederick despised the Irish, and wanted nothing to do with\r\nthem or their votes. Sir Frederick has no doubt, from his knowledge of\r\nwhat occurred during the canvass, that direct instructions were sent by\r\nMr. Parnell or his agents to the Irish voters in York to throw their\r\nvotes against the Radical candidates. These latter brought down a Home\r\nRule lecturer to counteract the effect of these instructions, and the\r\npamphlet above referred to was an eleventh-hour blow in the same\r\ninterest. It was successful; the Irish votes, some 500 in number, being\r\npolled early in the morning under the impression produced by it. The\r\nmoral of this incident would seem to be, not that there was any real\r\nunderstanding in 1885 between the Parnellites and the English\r\nConservatives at all, but simply that the English Radical wirepullers\r\nare more alert and active than either the Irish Parnellites or the\r\nEnglish Conservatives. It is interesting, too, as it illustrates the\r\ndeep dread and distrust of the \"Fenians\" in which the Parnellites\r\nhabitually go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE E.\r\n\r\nTHE \"BOYCOTT\" AT MILTOWN-MALBAY.\r\n\r\n(Vol. i. p. 209.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFather White of Miltown-Malbay, taking exception to the statement made\r\nby me, upon the authority of Colonel Turner, that he was \"the moving\r\nspirit\" of the local \"boycott\" of policemen and soldiers at that place,\r\naddressed a note to Colonel Turner on the 5th of September, in which he\r\ndesired to know whether Colonel Turner, had given me grounds for making\r\nthis statement. To this note Colonel Turner tells me he returned at once\r\nthe following reply, which he kindly forwards to me for publication:--\r\n\r\n    \"ENNIS, _6th September_ 1888.\r\n\r\n    \"REV. SIR,--I am in receipt of your letter of yesterday, and in\r\n    reply thereto beg to state that I informed Mr. Hurlbert that you\r\n    said 'in open court' that you had directed (I believe from the\r\n    altar) that the town was to be 'made as a city of the dead' during\r\n    the trials of 23 publicans who were charged for conspiracy in\r\n    boycotting the forces of the Crown who had been employed in\r\n    preserving the peace on the occasion of a former trial--this you\r\n    said you did in the interests of peace. The magistrates, however,\r\n    took a different view, viz., that it was done with the object of\r\n    preventing the military and police from obtaining any supplies,\r\n    which they were unable to do; and that their view was the correct\r\n    one was proved by the fact that half of the accused pleaded guilty\r\n    to the offence, and on promise of future good behaviour were allowed\r\n    out on their own recognisances. That the people followed your\r\n    instructions on that day, coupled with the fact that in your letter\r\n    to the _Freeman's Journal_, dated 17th March of this year, you\r\n    stated that you offered me peace all round on certain conditions,\r\n    thereby showing that at least you consider yourself possessed of\r\n    authority to bring about a state of peace or otherwise, probably led\r\n    Mr. Hurlbert, to whom I showed a copy of this letter, to infer that\r\n    you admitted that you were the moving spirit of all this 'local\r\n    boycott,' while you only did so in the particular case above\r\n    mentioned. Whether Mr. Hurlbert is correct in drawing the inference\r\n    he does as to your being the moving spirit, and as to your conduct,\r\n    may perhaps be gathered from the numerous numbers of _United\r\n    Ireland_ and other papers which he saw giving reports of illegal\r\n    meetings of the suppressed branch of the Miltown-Malbay National\r\n    League, at which you were stated to have presided, and at some of\r\n    which condemnatory resolutions were passed, and also from the fact\r\n    that you are reported to have presided at a meeting on Sunday, April\r\n    8, which was held at Miltown-Malbay in defiance of Government\r\n    proclamation.--I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n    ALFRED E. TURNER.\r\n\r\n    \"Rev. P. White, P.P., Miltown-Malbay.\"\r\n\r\nOn further investigation of his records, Colonel Turner found it\r\nnecessary to follow up this letter with another, a copy of which,\r\nthrough his courtesy, I subjoin:--\r\n\r\n    \"ENNIS, _10th September_ 1888.\r\n\r\n    \"REV. SIR,--A slight inaccuracy has been pointed out to me in my\r\n    letter to you of the 6th inst., which I hasten to correct. It\r\n    occurred in transcribing my letter from the original draft. I should\r\n    have said that I told Mr. Hurlbert that you stated in open court, at\r\n    the trial of 23 publicans charged with boycotting the forces of the\r\n    Crown on the occasion of a former trial, that you had told the\r\n    people (I believe from the altar) that the town was to be made as a\r\n    city of the dead during the former trial; and that in consequence\r\n    the soldiers and police could get nothing to eat or drink in Miltown\r\n    that day.\r\n\r\n    \"I also told him that this boycotting of the police was by no means\r\n    new, since on the 13th March 1887, at a meeting of the\r\n    Miltown-Malbay branch of the League at which you are reported to\r\n    have presided, in _United Ireland_ of 19/3/87, the following\r\n    resolution was unanimously adopted:--\r\n\r\n    \"'That from this day any person who supplies the police while\r\n    engaged in work which is opposed to the wishes of the people with\r\n    drink, food, or cars, be censured by this branch, and that no\r\n    further intercourse be held with them.'\r\n\r\n    \"I regret that through inadvertence I have had to trouble you with a\r\n    second letter.--I am, Rev. Sir, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n    \"ALFRED E. TURNER.\r\n\r\n    \"Rev. P. White, P.P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Vol. ii. p. 376.\r\n\r\n[2] Vol. ii. p. 364-370.\r\n\r\n[3] The exasperation of the local agitators under the cool and\r\ndetermined treatment of Mr. Tener may be measured by the facts stated in\r\nthe following communication received by me from Mr. Tener on the 20th of\r\nSeptember. I leave them to speak for themselves:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"POLICE BARRACKS, WOODFORD, _17th Sept._ 1888.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MR. HURLBERT,--I enclose you _a printed_ placard found posted\r\n    up in Woodford district on Sunday morning the 9th inst. It alludes\r\n    to _tenants_ who had paid me their rent,--and broken the 'unwritten\r\n    law of the League.' All the men named are now in great danger. The\r\n    police force of the district has been increased--for their\r\n    protection; but the police are very anxious about their safety!\r\n\r\n    \"I send you also a _pencil_ copy taken from a more _perfect_ placard\r\n    which the police preserve. John White or Whyte is the tenant whose\r\n    name I already have given you. He is the tall dark man whom you saw\r\n    (with an ex-bailiff) at Portumna. He was then an \"Evicted Tenant.\"\r\n    He has since been, on payment of his rent, restored to his farm by\r\n    me. And now, as you see in the placard, he is held up to the\r\n    vengeance of the \"League of Hell,\" as P.J. Smyth called it.--Yours,\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\n    \"ED. TENER.\r\n\r\n    \"_P.S._--The evictions were finished on the 1st of September, and on\r\n    the 9th (_after_ it became known that the men whose names are in the\r\n    placard had paid) the placard was issued.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _(Placard.)_\r\n\r\n    \"IRISHMEN!--Need we say in the face of the desperate Battle the\r\n    People are making for their Hearths and Homes that the time has come\r\n    for every HONEST MAN, trader and otherwise, to extend a helping hand\r\n    to the MEN in the GAP. You may ask, How will that be done? The\r\n    answer is plain.\r\n\r\n    \"Let those who have become traitors to their neighbours and their\r\n    Country be shunned as if they were possessed by a devil. Let no man\r\n    buy from them or sell to them, let no man work for them. Leave them\r\n    to Tener and his Emergency gang. The following are a few of the\r\n    greatest traitors and meanest creatures that ever walked--John\r\n    Whyte, of Dooras; Fahey (of the hill) of Dooras; big Anthony\r\n    Hackett, of Rossmore; Tom Moran, of Rossmore! Your Country calls on\r\n    you to treat them as they deserve. Bravo Woodford! Remember Tom\r\n    Larkin!--'GOD SAVE IRELAND!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] Appendix, Note A.\r\n\r\n[5] Appendix, Note B.\r\n\r\n[6] Appendix, Note C.\r\n\r\n[7] Appendix, Note D.\r\n\r\n[8] Since this was written fifteen Catholic bishops in England,\r\nheaded by the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, have united (April 12,\r\n1888) in a public protest against the Optional Oaths Bill, in which they\r\nsay: \"To efface the recognition of God in our public legislature is an\r\nact which will surely bring evil consequences.\" Yet how can the\r\nrecognition of God be more effectually \"effaced\" than by the unqualified\r\nassertion that the will of the people, or of a majority, is the one\r\nlegitimate source of political authority?\r\n\r\n[9] Mr. Blair was then a member of the Lincoln Cabinet, and its\r\n\"fighting member.\"\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. Quill stated that the Savings-Banks deposits increased\r\nin Ireland during 1887 eight per cent. more than in thrifty Scotland,\r\nand _forty per cent._ more than in England and Wales!\r\n\r\n[11] This was the Provost's last appearance in public. He died\r\nrather suddenly a few weeks afterwards.\r\n\r\n[12] In the Census of 1880 it appears that of 255,741 farms in\r\nIllinois, 59,624 were held on the métayer system, pronounced by Toubeau\r\nthe worst of systems, and 20,620 on a money rental.\r\n\r\n[13] I have since learned that Father M'Fadden sold another\r\nholding, rental 6s. 8d., for £80. He has three more holdings from\r\nCaptain Hill, at 15s., 6s. 8d., and 11s. 2d., for which he was in\r\narrears for two years in April 1887, when ejectment decrees were\r\nobtained against him. For his house holding he pays 2s. a year! So he\r\nwas really fighting his own battle as a tenant in the Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\n[14] Yet of Connemara, Cardinal Manning, in his letter to the\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, August 31, 1873, cites the \"trust-worthy\" evidence\r\nof \"an Englishman who had raised himself from the plough's tail,\" and\r\nwho had gone \"to see with his own eyes the material condition of the\r\npeasantry in Ireland.\" It was to the effect that in abundance and\r\nquality of food, in rate of wages, and even if the comfort of their\r\ndwellings, the working men of Connemara were better off than the\r\nagricultural labourers of certain English counties.\r\n\r\n[15] For this holding, of 10 Irish acres, I have since learned\r\nthe widow O'Donnell pays 10s. a year. She is in the receipt of outdoor\r\nrelief, there being fever in the house (May 1888).\r\n\r\n[16] This \"townland\" is a curious use of a Saxon term to\r\ndescribe a Celtic fact. The territory of an Irish sept seems to have\r\nbeen divided up into \"townlands,\" each townland consisting of four, or\r\nin some cases six, groups of holdings, occupied by as many families of\r\nthe \"sept.\" The chief of the \"sept\" divided up each \"townland\"\r\nperiodically among these groups, while the common fields were cut up\r\namong the families as they increased and multiplied according to the\r\nsystem--against which Lord George Hill battled at Gweedore--known as\r\n\"rimdale\" or \"rundeal,\" from the Celtic, \"ruindioll,\" a \"partition\" or\r\n\"man's share.\" This is quite unlike the Russian \"mir\" or collective\r\nvillage, and not more like the South Slav \"zadruga\" which makes each\r\nfamily a community, the land belonging to all, as, according to M.\r\nEugene Simon, it does in China. But it is as inconsistent with Henry\r\nGeorge's State ownership of the land or the rents as either of those\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n[17] From a question just asked (July 12) in the House of\r\nCommons, and answered by the Postmaster-General, I gather that this\r\n\"local question\" has been further complicated by the removal of Mr.\r\nSweeney, the sub-postmaster, under an official regulation.\r\n\r\n[18] The incident occurred in Clare. See p. 45.\r\n\r\n[19] Or they may date back to the Parliament of Grattan, who\r\nwrote to Mr. Guinness that he regarded the brewery of Ireland as \"the\r\nactual nurse of the people, and entitled to every encouragement, favour,\r\nand exemption.\"\r\n\r\n[20] This refers, I am told, to the murder, in open daylight,\r\nin 1881, of an old man, Linnane, who acted as a \"caretaker\" for Mrs.\r\nMoroney. It should gratify Father White to know that, as I am now\r\ninformed (May 21, 1888), a clue has just been found to the assassins,\r\nwho appear to have received the same price for doing their work that was\r\npaid the murderers of Fitzmaurice.\r\n\r\n[21] Mrs. Moroney, so often referred to here, is the widow of a\r\ngentleman formerly High Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant for the County\r\nClare, who died in 1870. She lives at Milton House, and has fought the\r\nlocal League steadily and successfully.",
