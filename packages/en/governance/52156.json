It will be\r\nconceded that the most important element of Parliaments--specially\r\nchosen to embody the collective wisdom of the nation--is the legitimate\r\nmethod of their constitution. Given the unrestricted rights of\r\nelection, a representative House of Commons is the happy result;\r\nthe opposite follows a tampering with the franchise, and debauched\r\nconstituencies. The effects of bribery, intimidation, undue influence,\r\ncoercion on the part of the Crown or its responsible advisers, an\r\nextensive system of personal patronage, boroughmongering, close or\r\npocket boroughs, and all those contraband devices of old to hamper\r\nthe popular choice of representatives, have inevitably produced a\r\nlegislature more or less corrupt, as history has registered. Bad as\r\nwere the workings of the electoral system anterior to the advent\r\nof parliamentary reform, it speaks volumes for the manly nature of\r\nBritish electors and their representatives that Parliaments thus basely\r\nconstituted were, on the whole, fairly honest, nor unmindful altogether\r\nof those liberties of the subject they were by supposition elected to\r\nmaintain; and when symptoms of corruption in the Commons became patent,\r\nthe degeneracy was not long countenanced, the national spirit being\r\nsufficiently vigorous to crush the threatened evils, and bring about a\r\nhealthier state of things.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive subject of parliamentary elections is rich in\r\ninterest and entertainment; the history of the rise, progress, and\r\ndevelopment of the complex art of electioneering recommends itself to\r\nthe attention of all who have an interest in the features inseparable\r\nfrom that constitution which has been lauded as a model for other\r\nnations to imitate. The strong national characteristics surrounding, in\r\nbygone days, the various stages of parliamentary election--peculiarly a\r\nBritish institution, in which, of all people, our countrymen were most\r\nat home--are now, by an improved elective procedure, relegated to the\r\nlimbo of the past, while the records of electioneering exist but as\r\ntraditions in the present.\r\n\r\nWith the modifying influence of progress, and a more advanced\r\ncivilisation, the time may come when the narrative of the robustious\r\nscenes of canvassing, polling, chairing, and election-feasting, with\r\ntheir attendant incidents of all-prevailing bribery, turbulence, and\r\nintrigue, may be regarded with incredulity as fictions of an impossible\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIt has been endeavoured to give the salient features of the most\r\nremarkable election contests, from the time when seats began to\r\nbe sought after until comparatively recent days. The “Spendthrift\r\nElections,” remarkable in the annals of parliamentary and party\r\nwarfare, are set down, with a selection from the literature, squibs,\r\nballads, and broadsides to which they gave rise. The illustrations\r\nare selected from the pictorial satires produced contemporaneously\r\nupon the most famous electoral struggles. The materials, both literary\r\nand graphic, are abundant, but scattered; it is hoped that both\r\nentertainment and enlightenment may be afforded to a tolerant public by\r\nthe writer’s efforts to bring these resources within the compass of a\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n    The assembling of parliaments--Synopsis of parliamentary\r\n    history--Orders for the attendance of members--Qualifications\r\n    for the franchise: burgesses, burgage-tenures, scot and lot,\r\n    pot-wallopers, faggot-votes, splitting--Disqualifications:\r\n    alms, charity, “faggots,” “occasionality”--Election of knights\r\n    of the shire, and burgesses--Outlines of an election in the\r\n    Middle Ages--Queen Elizabeth and her faithful Commons--An\r\n    early instance of buying a seat in the Commons--Returns\r\n    vested in the municipal corporations;

John was the first\r\nking recorded to summon his barons by writ; this was directed to the\r\nBishop of Salisbury. In 1234 a representative parliament of two knights\r\nfrom every shire was convened to grant an aid; later on (1286) came\r\nthe parliament of Merton; and in 1258 was inaugurated the assembly\r\nof knights and burgesses, designated the _mad_ parliament. The first\r\nassembly of the Commons as “a confirmed representation” (Dugdale) was\r\nin 1265, when the earliest writ extant was issued; while, according\r\nto many historians, the first regular parliament met in 1294 (22 Edw.\r\n1), when borough representation is said to have commenced. From a\r\ndeliberative assembly, it became in 1308 a legislative power, without\r\nwhose assent no law could be legally constituted; and in 1311, annual\r\nparliaments were ordered. The next progressive step was the election\r\nof a Speaker by the Commons; the first was Peter de la Mare, 1377. A\r\nparliament of _one_ day (September 29, 1399), when Richard II. was\r\ndeposed, is certainly an incident in the history of this institution;\r\nthe Commons now began to assert its control over pecuniary grants.\r\nIn 1404 was held at Coventry the “Parliamentum Indoctum” from which\r\nlawyers were excluded (and that must have offered a marked contrast\r\nto parliaments in our generation). In 1407 the Lords and Commons\r\nassembled to transact business in the Sovereign’s absence. Reforms\r\nwere clearly then deemed expedient: in 1413 members were obliged to\r\nreside at the places they represented,--this enactment has occasioned\r\nexpense and inconvenience in obeying “the letter,” but appears to\r\nhave otherwise been easily defeated as regards “the spirit;”[1] in\r\n1430 the Commons adopted the forty-shillings qualification for county\r\nmembers. A parliament was held at Coventry in 1459; this was called\r\nthe _Diabolicum_. The statutes were first printed in 1483; in 1542\r\nthe privilege of exemption from arrest was secured to members; and in\r\n1549 the eldest sons of Peers were admitted to sit in the Commons.\r\nWith James I. commenced those collisions between the Crown and the\r\nrepresentatives of the people which marked the Stuart rule. The Commons\r\nresisted those fine old blackmail robberies known during preceding\r\nreigns as “benevolences,” under which plea forced contributions were\r\nlevied by the Crown, especially during Elizabeth’s reign. James I.\r\npushed these abuses too far, in his greed for money.\r\n\r\nThe parliament of 1614 refused to grant supplies until grievances\r\nwere redressed; James dismissed them, and imprisoned several members.\r\nThis short session was known as the “Addled Parliament.” The “Long\r\nParliament” assembled in 1640, and the House of Peers was abolished by\r\nit in 1649; and later on, a Peer sat in the Commons. This parliament,\r\nproving intractable, was dissolved by Cromwell in 1653. Under Charles\r\nII., with the restoration of monarchy, the Peers temporal resumed\r\ntheir functions, and in 1661 the Lords spiritual were allowed to\r\nresume their seats, and the Act for triennial parliaments was unwisely\r\nset aside by the Commons. The relations between the Crown and the\r\nCommons were again becoming strained in 1667, when an Act excluding\r\nRoman Catholics from sitting in either House was forced through the\r\nlegislature. From this point the narrative of electioneering incidents\r\nmay commence, the more appropriately since it was at this time there\r\narose the institution of the familiar party distinctions of Whig and\r\nTory.\r\n\r\nThe orders for the attendance of members and the Speaker were somewhat\r\ncurious; for instance, among the orders in parliament regulating\r\nprocedure, the following are noteworthy:--\r\n\r\n    Feb. 14, 1606.--The House to assemble at eight o’clock, and\r\n    enter into the great business at nine.\r\n\r\n    May 13, 1614.--The House to meet at seven o’clock in the\r\n    morning, and begin to read bills at ten.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 15, 1620.--The Speaker not to move his hat until the third\r\n    _congée_.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 12, 1640.--Those who go out of the House in a confused\r\n    manner before the Speaker to forfeit 10_s._\r\n\r\n    May 1, 1641.--All the members that come after eight to pay\r\n    1_s._, and those that do not come the whole day to pay 5_s._\r\n\r\n    April 19, 1642.--Those who do not come to prayers to pay 1_s._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 14, 1643.--Such members as come after nine o’clock to pay\r\n    1_s._ to the poor.\r\n\r\n    March 21, 1647.--The Speaker to leave the chair at twelve\r\n    o’clock.\r\n\r\n    May 31, 1659.--The Speaker to take the chair constantly every\r\n    morning by eight o’clock.\r\n\r\n    April 8, 1670.--The back door in the Speaker’s chamber to be\r\n    nailed up during the session.\r\n\r\n    March 23, 1693.--No member to take tobacco into the gallery, or\r\n    to the table, sitting at committees.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 11, 1695.--No news-letter writer to presume to meddle with\r\n    the debates, or disperse any in their papers.\r\n\r\nOrders touching motions for leave into the country:--\r\n\r\n    Feb. 13, 1620.--No member shall go out of town without open\r\n    motion and licence in the House.\r\n\r\n    March 28, 1664.--The penalty of £10 to be paid by every knight,\r\n    and £5 by every citizen, etc., who shall make default in\r\n    attending.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 6, 1666.--To be sent for in custody of the serjeant.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 18, 1666.--Such members of the House as depart into\r\n    the country without leave, be sent for in custody of the\r\n    serjeant-at-arms.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 13, 1667.--That every defaulter in attendance, whose\r\n    excuse shall not be allowed this day, be fined the sum of £40,\r\n    and sent for in custody, and committed to the Tower till the\r\n    fine be paid.\r\n\r\n    That every member as shall desert the service of the House\r\n    for the space of three days together (not having had leave\r\n    granted him by the House, nor offering such sufficient excuse\r\n    to the House as shall be allowed), shall have the like fine\r\n    of £40 imposed on them, and shall be sent for in custody, and\r\n    committed to the Tower; and that the fines be paid into the\r\n    hands of the serjeant-at-arms, to be disposed of as the House\r\n    shall direct.\r\n\r\n    April 6, 1668.--To pay a fine of £10.\r\n\r\nA few words of explanation regarding technicalities will be found\r\nin place, since the qualifications of voters have a distinctive\r\nlanguage of their own, used to indicate their various degrees of\r\nelectoral privilege. The terms, “burgage tenures,” “scot and lot,”\r\n“pot-wallopers,” “splitting,” “faggot votes,” etc., occur constantly,\r\nand it may be desirable to indicate in advance the meanings attached to\r\nthese enigmatical expressions.\r\n\r\nBurgage tenures consist of one undivided and indivisible tenement,\r\nneither created, nor capable of creation, within time of memory, which\r\nhas immemorially given a right of voting; or an entire indivisible\r\ntenement, holden of the superior lord of a borough, by an immemorial\r\ncertain rent, distinctly reserved, and to which the right of voting is\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nAnother qualification determined the right of voting “to be in such\r\npersons as are seized in fee, in possession, or reversion, of any\r\nmessuage, tenement, or corporal hereditament within the borough, and in\r\nsuch persons as are tenants for life or lives, and, for want of such\r\nfreeholds, in tenants for years determinable upon any life or lives,\r\npaying scot and lot, and in them and in no other.”\r\n\r\nPotwallers--those who, as lodgers, boil the pot. Pot-wallopers, or\r\nPot-boilers.\r\n\r\nThe word Burgess extends to inhabitants within the borough.\r\n\r\nThe right of election being generally vested “in inhabitants paying\r\nscot and lot, and not receiving alms or any charity,” these terms\r\nrequire explanation. What it is to pay scot and lot, or to _pay scot_\r\nand _bear lot_ is nowhere exactly defined. According to Stockdale’s\r\n“Parliamentary Guide,” compiled in 1784, it is probable that, from\r\nsignifying some special municipal or parochial tax or duty, they\r\ncame in time to be used in a popular sense, to comprehend generally\r\nthe burdens and obligations to which the inhabitants of a borough or\r\nparish were liable as such. What seems the proper interpretation is,\r\nthat by inhabitants “paying scot and lot,” those persons are meant\r\nwhose circumstances are sufficiently independent to enable them to\r\ncontribute in general to such taxes and burdens as they are liable to\r\nas inhabitants of the place. In Scotland, when a person petitions to be\r\nadmitted a burgess of a royal borough, he engages he will _scot_ and\r\n_lot_, i.e. _watch_ and _ward_; and by statute (2 Geo. 1, c. 18, s. 9)\r\nit is ascertained that in the election of representatives for the city\r\nof London, the legislature understood _scot_ and _lot_ to be as here\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nAs to the disqualifications, _alms_ means parochial collections or\r\nparish relief; and _charity_ signifies sums arising from the revenue of\r\ncertain specific sums which have been established or bequeathed for the\r\npurpose of assisting the poor. There are further nice distinctions in\r\nthe latter; for on election petitions persons receiving certain defined\r\ncharities were qualified to vote, while other charities disqualify\r\nfor the identical return. The burgage tenement decision which defines\r\nthe nature of this qualification as set down, arose on a controverted\r\nelection in 1775 for Downeton or Downton, a borough in Wilts, the\r\nright of voting being admitted by both sides to be “in persons having\r\na freehold interest in burgage tenements, holden by a certain rent,\r\nfealty, and suit of court, of the Bishop of Winchester, who is lord of\r\nthe borough, and paying reliefs on descent and fines on alienation.”\r\nThomas Duncombe and Thomas Drummer were the sitting members; and the\r\ncounsel for the petitioners, Sir Philip Hales and John Cooper, objected\r\nto some twenty votes recorded for the candidates elected. “It was\r\nproved that the conveyances to some were made in 1768, _i.e._ the last\r\ngeneral election, but that the deeds had remained since that time in\r\nthe hands of Mr. Duncombe, who is proprietor of nearly two-thirds of\r\nthe burgage tenements in Downton; so that the occupiers had continued\r\nto pay their rents to him, and expected to do so when they became due\r\nagain, considering him as their landlord, and being unacquainted with\r\nthe grants made by him to the voters; and that there were no entries\r\non the court rolls of 1768 of those conveyances, nor of the payment\r\nof the alienation fines. The conveyances to others appeared to have\r\nbeen _printed_ at the expense of Mr. Duncombe, and executed after the\r\nwrit and precept had been issued, some of them being brought _wet_ to\r\nthe poll. The grantees did not know where the lands contained in them\r\nlay, and one man at the poll produced a grant for which he claimed a\r\nvote, which, on examination, appeared to be made to another person.”\r\nThe practice of making such conveyances about the time of an election\r\nhad long prevailed in the borough; the votes so manufactured were known\r\nby the name of _faggots_; and the petitioners contended such votes,\r\nalthough pertaining to obsolete “burgage” immunities, were “colourable,\r\nfraudulent, and void,” both by the common law of parliament, and the\r\nstatute of William III. aimed at abuses, and commonly called the\r\n_Splitting_ Act. Besides the general objection of “occasionally,” a\r\nproportion of the votes for the sitting members was impeached for\r\nreasons drawn from the nature of burgage tenements, as set forth in the\r\ndefinition of these terms. Whence it was decided that Mr. Duncombe had\r\ndone his spiriting so clumsily that neither he nor his colleague could\r\nbe considered duly elected as burgesses to serve in the parliament in\r\nquestion, and the petitioners ought to be returned in their places.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 the Earl of Radnor was patron of this same borough of Downton,\r\nSir T. B. Pechall and the Hon. Bouverie being its representatives, and\r\nthe votes being vested in the persons having a freehold interest in\r\nburgage tenures and held of the Bishop of Winchester; the number of\r\nvoters is not given--possibly J. J. Stockdale (election agent), who\r\ncompiled the “Election Manual,” was unable to discover any.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, while they were permitted to exist, those qualifications\r\nwhich surrounded burgage tenures were founded on shadowy premises; for\r\ninstance, Horsham (Sussex) was summoned to send burgesses to parliament\r\nfrom the 28th of Edward I. According to Bohun, the Duke of Norfolk, as\r\nlord thereof, held the entire election in his own hands, the bailiffs,\r\nchosen by the duke’s steward in the court-leet held at Michaelmas,\r\nhaving been the principal officers which returned members to serve\r\nin parliament; while as to the constituents and their suffrages, the\r\nqualifications for these add a fresh and startling paragraph to the\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n    “The house or land that pays twelve pence a year to the Duke,\r\n    is called a whole burgership; but these tenancies have been\r\n    splitted into such small parts, that he who has only so much\r\n    land, or part of a house, as pays two pence a year, is now by\r\n    custom entitled to vote for members to serve in parliament; but\r\n    it is the tenant of the freehold, though not resident in the\r\n    place, or occupier of the house, or land, that has the right to\r\n    vote.”\r\n\r\nThe outlines of an election, when the state of “villainage,”\r\napproximating to feudal serfdom, was the condition of the labouring\r\nclasses, have been sketched by Sir Francis Palgrave. From the pages of\r\nhis “Truths and Fictions of the Middle Ages” we obtain a vivid picture\r\nof the manner of the quest for representatives to serve the king in\r\nparliament, as it might have presented itself to the faithful lieges in\r\nthe fourteenth century, at the three annual seasons for summoning the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, Sir Roger de Swigville, mounted on a noble steed worthy\r\nof so stout a knight, rides up to the county court, the scene of the\r\nelections of the period, where is gathered a goodly assemblage of\r\nmounted gentry; the sheriff’s javelin-men about him, his silken and\r\nbroidered banner waving in the breeze; and forthwith is displayed the\r\nsacred scrap of parchment, the “king’s writ,” informing the estates\r\nof the realm in the learned Latin tongue, that a parliament is to be\r\nholden at Westminster, Winchester, York, or elsewhere. The baronage and\r\nfreeholders are bidden to choose a worthy and discreet knight of the\r\nshire for the county, to aid the king with his advice,--duly providing\r\nfor his expenses during the term while parliament may sit, and for his\r\ncharges going and returning; but first taking due care to ascertain\r\nif the great baron of the county--De Clare or De Bohun--has not\r\nalready signified, through his steward or attorney, whom he would have\r\nchosen. The name of Sir Fulke de Braose is mentioned--yonder handsome\r\n“chivaler” who, hawk on wrist, is watching the proceedings; but that\r\ngay knight preferreth the excitements of war or sport, and at the Words\r\n“election” and “parliament,” he hastily withdraws from the crowd, and\r\nspurreth off as fast as his good horse may carry him. The “Chiltern\r\nHundreds” was a sanctuary where knights, anxious to avoid the honour of\r\nbeing sent to the senate, frequently sought refuge.\r\n\r\nIt was Elizabeth who took a practical course with her faithful Commons,\r\nand in businesslike fashion admonished them not to waste their time\r\nin long and vain discourses, but to apply themselves at once to their\r\nfunction--that of voting supplies, and, on occasions, of granting\r\n“benevolences,” that is, forced loans to the Crown.\r\n\r\nAccording to some writers, the earliest recorded instance of corruption\r\nin electioneering matters occurred under date 1571, but the incident\r\nhardly comes under the description of bribery. In the “Parliamentary\r\nHistory” (i. 765), it is stated from the journals of 1571, that one\r\nThomas Long was returned for the borough of Westbury, Wilts, who,\r\n“being found to be a very simple man, and not fit to serve in that\r\nplace, was questioned how he came to be elected.” It seems that extreme\r\nsimplicity was so unusual in the House that its presence was easily\r\ndetected; in any case, Thomas Long acted up to his reputation, and\r\nreplied with a frankness not commonly exhibited in the admissions made\r\nbefore election committees and their perquisitions: “The poor man\r\nimmediately confessed to the House that he gave to Anthony Garland,\r\nmayor of the said town of Westbury, and one Watts of the same, £4 for\r\nhis place in parliament.” This was certainly a modest consideration for\r\na seat, when it is considered that famous electioneering tacticians,\r\nlike the Duke of Wharton, in a later generation, exhausted ample\r\nfortunes in the traffic of constituencies. Moreover, this simple\r\npurchaser of a place in parliament, though he forfeited his bargain,\r\ndid not lose his money; “an order was made that the said Garland and\r\nWatts should repay unto the said Thos. Long the £4 they had of him.”\r\nAlthough the actual briber escaped scot-free, the inquiry terminated\r\nwith the infliction of a severe penalty on those who had been convicted\r\nof venality, “a fine of £20 being assessed for the queen’s use on the\r\nsaid corporation and inhabitants of Westbury for their scandalous\r\nattempt.” This precept was not without its use, and in the future\r\nhistory of this species of corruption it will be found that mayors\r\nand corporations--in whose influence once rested that “merchantable\r\nproperty,” the right of selecting representatives--grew more\r\nexperienced in iniquitous ways, and exacted the highest tariff for the\r\nsaleable commodity they offered, besides making choice of more cunning\r\npurchasers, and, moreover, generally managed to get not only the best\r\nof the bargain, but contrived to avoid being forced to disgorge their\r\nill-gotten gains; the proverb still remains, a relic of the days in\r\nwhich it had its origin, “Money makes the mayor to go.”\r\n\r\nThe privilege of parliament which protected the persons of members was\r\nalready sought after in Elizabeth’s days for its incidental advantages;\r\nthus, John Smith, whose name is mentioned in the “Parliamentary\r\nHistory,” presented himself to be elected for Camelford, for the\r\npurpose of defrauding his creditors--a _ruse_ which was allowed to\r\nsucceed by a tolerant chamber,--privilege, however, and the continuance\r\nof his seat were voted by 112 to 107.\r\n\r\nMr. Norton, in 1571, speaks of “the imperfection of choice, too often\r\nseen, by sending of unfit men;” and he notices as one cause, “the\r\nchoice made by boroughs, for the most part of strangers.”\r\n\r\nInterference in elections by the territorial lords, or by the Church,\r\nwas resented about this time:--\r\n\r\n    “A penalty of £40 proposed upon every borough that should elect\r\n    at the nomination of a nobleman, one great disorder, that\r\n    many young men, not experienced, for learning sake were often\r\n    chosen. Proposed that none under thirty years of age should be\r\n    returned.”\r\n\r\nFrom the “Parliamentary History” we secure the account of a disputed\r\nreturn for Buckinghamshire in the year 1603, set down by the sheriff as\r\nreturning officer:--\r\n\r\n    “About eight o’clock he came to Brickhill; was there told\r\n    by Sir George Throckmorton and others that the first voice\r\n    would be given for Sir Francis Goodwin; he answered ‘he hoped\r\n    it would not be so,’ and ‘desired every gentleman to deal\r\n    with his freeholders.’ After eight went to the election....\r\n    After the writ was read, he first intimated the points of the\r\n    proclamation, then jointly proposed Sir John Fortescue and\r\n    Sir F. Goodwin. The freeholders cried, first, ‘A Goodwin, a\r\n    Goodwin!’ Every Justice of the Peace on the bench said, ‘A\r\n    Fortescue, a Fortescue!’”\r\n\r\nElection proceedings began early in those days, and parliamentary hours\r\nwere equally matinal. From the pamphlets, tracts, and broadsides of the\r\nStuart era it may be noted that the Speaker took his place in the House\r\nat eight o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“The knights girt with swords by their sides,” as returned for the\r\nshires of the counties, were important personages, the influential\r\nfamilies retaining this prerogative in their houses for generations;\r\nthe names of the great county families may be traced, according to\r\ntheir respective localities, for more than a century in uninterrupted\r\nsuccession as the county members, as may be observed in the compendious\r\nlists of the knights, citizens, and burgesses of parliaments summoned\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Chaucer relates of his\r\nFrankleyn--\r\n\r\n    “Ful ofte tyme he was a knight of the schire.”\r\n\r\nIt was, as Hannay has expressed it, the great gentry who seem to have\r\naccepted the girding of the sword, in something like turns, as both\r\na dignity and a duty. “From such men the House of Commons took that\r\nhigh, that _gentle_ tone, which has often been so justly boasted of\r\nby its great men, and which it is to be hoped it will retain, through\r\nwhatever changes are destined for it.” The dignity of representation\r\nin the earlier stages of parliamentary history does not appear to have\r\nextended beyond the knights of the shires; those of this select order\r\nmight, if they had the ambition, contest among themselves, but it is\r\ndifficult to imagine electoral contests among the representatives of\r\na less exalted class--the citizens and burgesses, whose election was\r\nat first very much at the discretion of the sheriffs. When the real\r\nparliamentary strength lay in the baronage, the worthies who came up\r\nfrom the cities and boroughs to advise about taxation were not much\r\nregarded originally, and seem to have conducted themselves, during\r\ntheir brief visits to the Commons House, with a docility of demeanour,\r\nsupposed to be in keeping with their native obscurity; as, for the\r\nmost part, they were but nominees or placemen of Peers and Lords of\r\nparliament, of ecclesiastical hierarchs, of officers of State, or put\r\nforward by lords of manors, influential families, and dispensers of\r\npreferment of one kind or another, a retiring and deferential line of\r\nconduct was due from these mere parliamentary “pawns” to their patrons.\r\nThis state of subjection appears foreign to the independence by\r\npresumption associated with the character of a member of parliament,\r\nand might be taken as belonging only to a feudal epoch; but with rare\r\nintervals of self-assertion on the part of the people, such as happened\r\nduring the civil wars--when the equipoise of society was unsettled\r\nfor a space--it must be admitted that at least a considerable portion\r\nof the Commons under the boroughmongering and patronage-monopolizing\r\ndays, which reached to 1831, was not far removed from the condition\r\nof semi-vassalage as described, until the revision and extension of\r\nthe representative system assimilated the constitution of the Commons\r\nin earnest to what by a plausible fiction it was “on trust” for\r\ngenerations assumed to be.\r\n\r\nIt is shown that in the early days of the representative system the\r\nhigh obligation of sending members to parliament was regarded as a\r\nburden instead of a privilege by many boroughs, and that exemption\r\nfrom this duty was a boon for which sacrifices were cheerfully made;\r\nmoreover it was a “right” which constituencies managed to leave in\r\nabeyance, intermitting in many instances for a century or more. By\r\nthe same rule, electoral bodies were relieved to get rid of their\r\nresponsibilities, before the days of sordid trafficking, and while\r\nvenal boroughmongering was still an undeveloped branch of gain: it\r\nwas at first accepted by the cities and boroughs as a kindly service\r\non the part of a great man to choose the citizens and burgesses\r\nfor parliament; “influence” was not considered “undue” when it was\r\nexercised in dictating the choice of what by a traditional figment were\r\nconsidered the popular representatives. Thus, in Elizabeth’s reign,\r\nquite as a matter of course, Devereux, Earl of Essex, was busying\r\nhimself in providing such nominees as he thought fitting for various\r\nplaces, as appears from the following letter, addressed to Richard\r\nBagot, of Staffordshire, and printed with the “Memorials of the Bagot\r\nfamily,” 1592:--\r\n\r\n    “After my very hartie commendacions. I have written several\r\n    letters to Lichfield, Stafford, Tamworth, and Newcastle for\r\n    the _Nomination_ and _Election_ of certain Burgesses for\r\n    the Parliament to be held very shortlie; having named unto\r\n    them, for Lichfield, Sir John Wingfield and Mr. Broughton.\r\n    For Stafford, my kinsman Henry Bourgcher, and my _servant_\r\n    Edward Reynolds. For Tamworth, my _servant_ Thomas Smith. For\r\n    Newcastle, Dr. James. Whom because I do greatlie desire to\r\n    be preferred to the said places, I do earnestlie pray your\r\n    furtherance by the credit which you have in those towns.”\r\n\r\nThe mere dealing in “parliamentary interest” was still undeveloped\r\nas regarded its monetary aspect, but party strengthened its ranks by\r\nnominating candidates, first, because it was the “will and pleasure”\r\nof those who held the influence; secondly, when the possessor of\r\nseveral boroughs began to realize he could utilize his seats in many\r\nways, electioneering science took a new departure, and boroughs and\r\n“burgage tenures” began to be cultivated for the market like any other\r\ntrafficable commodity.\r\n\r\n    “Formerly,” says Waller, “the neighbourhood desired the member\r\n    to sit, and there was an end; but now it is a kind of empire.\r\n    Some hundred years ago, some boroughs sent not; they could get\r\n    none to serve; but now it is a fashion, and a fine thing they\r\n    are revived.”\r\n\r\nThe ancient system was shaken in the early Stuart days: under Charles\r\nI. we find ministers still writing of those “seats which were safe,”\r\nand where, such as in the “Cinque Ports,” patronage could secure the\r\nelection of placemen; but opposition was ripe in the land, and when the\r\nstand was to be made against the Crown “in many places the elections\r\nwere managed with much popular heat and tumult.” The strength of the\r\nChurch was matched against dissent--“that incredible heresy;” then\r\nbegan Puritan corporations which exhibited a “factious activity” in the\r\nboroughs, and thus raised to white heat the indignation of territorial\r\nmagnates; thence did lords of the manor bestir themselves for the\r\nassertion of traditional privileges, by easy degenerations swollen\r\ninto prescriptive rights and oppressive tyrannies. Hence attempted\r\ncoercions; “certain lord-lieutenants of the counties were accused of\r\nmaking an improper use of the Train-bands,” the beginning of the\r\nsystem of electioneering intimidation. Thus we are informed that, in\r\nthe year 1639:--\r\n\r\n    “In many places the elections were managed with much popular\r\n    heat and tumult by the countenance of those English nobility\r\n    and gentry of the Scottish faction. At the County election for\r\n    Essex, for instance, the Earl of Warwick made good use of his\r\n    lord-lieutenancy, in sending letters out to the captains of\r\n    the Train-bands, who having power to charge the people with\r\n    arms, durst not offend, which brought many to his side. Those\r\n    ministers who gave their voices for my Lord of Warwick, as Mr.\r\n    Marshal and others, preached often out of their own parishes\r\n    before the election. Our corporation of Essex, consisting most\r\n    of Puritans, and having had their voices in electing their\r\n    own burgesses, and then to come to elect knights, is more\r\n    than the greatest lord of England hath in their boroughs;\r\n    the multiplicity of the people are mean-conditioned, and\r\n    most factious, and few subsidy-men; and therefore in no way\r\n    concerned in the election.\r\n\r\n    “A man having but forty shillings a year freehold hath as great\r\n    a voice in the election as any; and yet this man is never a\r\n    subsidy-man, and, therefore, no way concerned in the election\r\n    for his own particular; and when the statute was made two\r\n    centuries earlier (in 1430) forty shillings, it was then twenty\r\n    pound in value now. And it were a great quiet to the state if\r\n    it were reduced to that; and then gentlemen would be looked\r\n    upon, and it would save the ministers a great deal of pains, in\r\n    preaching from their own churches.”\r\n\r\nAbout 1640, although absolute intimidation was not common, it at least\r\nwas resorted to in the case of one candidate, who suffered therefrom,\r\nand evidently entered a subsequent protest. In Nalson’s papers it is\r\nrecorded:--“A paper sent to the Secretary of State by Mr. Nevil, of\r\nCressing Temple, the unsuccessful candidate, whose life was threatened.\r\n‘It was said among the people that if Nevil had the day they would\r\ntear the gentleman to pieces.’” Walpole, otherwise unscrupulous in\r\nhis resort to corruption of various kinds, appears to have avoided\r\ndownright violence; it was reserved for the Pelhams and the Duke of\r\nGrafton to bring armed force to the hustings by way of intimidating\r\nopposition--an unsatisfactory state of affairs which reached its most\r\nunconstitutional proportions under the administration of William\r\nPitt, when those Court candidates selected from the two services\r\nreceived the support of both army and navy; when the guards and\r\nsailors surrounded the hustings, and menaced such as were prepared to\r\nrecord votes for candidates other than their employers. Much might be\r\nwritten of the struggles in which envenomed adversaries were led into\r\npersonal encounters; and rival factions, as between the Cavaliers and\r\nRoundheads, went to great lengths in their hostilities: but when the\r\nexcitement cooled down, the honour of sitting for a borough did not, as\r\na rule, excite fierce competition, at least, anterior to the Revolution\r\nwhich dismissed the Stuarts; members were proposed and accepted in a\r\nhalf-hearted way, and the burgesses sent to Parliament seemed little\r\nambitious of the honour.\r\n\r\nThe method in which a member was selected in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century for the city of Bath, even then a place of\r\nimportance,[2] which a short while after became a celebrated centre for\r\nelection contests and ministerial and party intrigues, may be studied\r\nwith all its simple minutiæ among the “Nugæ Antiquæ,” (vol. ii.)\r\nprepared from the family papers of the Harringtons, landed proprietors\r\nin the locality, who, from father to son, had represented the citizens\r\nin successive sessions:--\r\n\r\n    “_To our much honoured and worthie Friend, J. Harrington, Esq.,\r\n    at his house at Kelston, near Bathe._\r\n\r\n    ”WORTHIE SIR,\r\n\r\n    “Out of the long experience we have had of your approved worth\r\n    and sincerity, our Cittie of Bathe have determined and settled\r\n    their resolutions to elect you for Burgess of the House of\r\n    Commons in this present Parliament, for our said Cittie, and do\r\n    hope you will accept the trouble thereof: which if you do, our\r\n    desire is you will not fail to be with us at Bathe on Monday\r\n    next, the eighth of this instant, by eight of the morning at\r\n    the furthest, for then we proceed to our election. And of your\r\n    determination we entreat you to certifie us by a word or two in\r\n    writing, and send it by the bearer to\r\n\r\n  “Your assured loving friends,\r\n  ”JOHN BIGG, _the Mayor_.\r\n  ”WILLIAM CHAPMAN.\r\n\r\n  “Bathe.”\r\n\r\nThere is some obscurity as to the dates; according to Willis, John\r\nHarrington sat for Bath 1658-9.\r\n\r\nThe progress of these negotiations is set down in the diary of the\r\nworthy gentleman selected to serve:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A NOTE OF MY BATHE BUSINESS ABOUT THE PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n    “Dec. 26.--Went to Bathe and dined with the Mayor and Citizens;\r\n    conferred about my election to serve in parliament, as my\r\n    father was helpless and ill able to go any more; went to\r\n    the George Inn at night, met the Bailiffs, and desired to\r\n    be dismissed from serving; drank strong bear and metheglin;\r\n    expended about iiij_s._; went home late, but could not get\r\n    excused, as they entertained a good opinion of my father.\r\n\r\n    “Dec. 28.--Went to Bathe; met Sir John Horner; we were chosen\r\n    by the Citizens to serve for the city. The Mayor and Citizens\r\n    conferred about Parliament business. _The Mayor promised Sir\r\n    John Horner and myself a horse apiece when we went to London to\r\n    the Parliament_, which we accepted of....\r\n\r\n    “Thursday, Dec. 31.--Went to Bathe; Mr. Ashe preached [this was\r\n    before the members, probably in state at the Abbey]. Dined at\r\n    the George Inn with the Mayor and 4 citizens; spent vj_s._ in\r\n    wine.\r\n\r\n  “Laid out in victuals at the George Inn          xj_s._  4_d._\r\n  “Laid out in drinking                           vij_s._ ii_d._\r\n  “Laid out in tobacco and drinking vessels      iiij_s._  4_d._\r\n\r\n    “Jan. 1.--My father gave me £4 to bear out my expenses at\r\n    Bathe.”\r\n\r\nThe members were salaried at this time, being allowed from two\r\nshillings to three shillings and fourpence, and in exceptional cases\r\nfive shillings, per day during the sessions of the Commons, although in\r\nmany instances no more than two shillings was the recognized fee;[3]\r\nthese wages were generally raised by the town, and paid in a lump sum\r\nat the close of the sessions.\r\n\r\nThe writ directs two knights to be chosen out of every county, two\r\ncitizens out of every city, and two burgesses out of every borough.\r\nThe counties were well known, and had long been ascertained; but the\r\nsheriffs had it left to their discretion as to the cities and boroughs.\r\nThey were the _dominicæ civitates_ and _burgi regis_, viz. such as had\r\ncharters from the king and paid a fee-farm rent in lieu of the customs\r\nand other advantages and royalties that belonged to the Crown; but\r\nthese not being named in the writ, the sheriffs took great liberties,\r\neither by summoning such as had no right, or omitting others, who ought\r\nto have been summoned: this arose from the nature of the institution.\r\n\r\n    “The representation of the nation in parliament was then a\r\n    burden to the people, the elected being paid by their electors;\r\n    nor doth it appear that the representatives at that time had\r\n    any advantage more than their wages. Cities and boroughs were,\r\n    therefore, not fond of returning representatives to Parliament,\r\n    and it was reckoned a privilege to be exempted, and to obtain\r\n    which there are more instances than one of petitions having\r\n    been presented. Sheriffs would frequently act in a very partial\r\n    and arbitrary manner, and out of pique return many _poor\r\n    boroughs_, who were not able _to pay their representatives_,\r\n    and omit others who were able, _in order to show favour towards\r\n    them_.”\r\n\r\nThis became a veritable grievance, and, in 5 Rich. 2, a law was made\r\nto hinder these arbitrary proceedings, and several boroughs were, by\r\ncharter from the Crown, exempted from what they would have esteemed a\r\nhardship and burden upon them.\r\n\r\nColchester returned members to Parliament 23 Edward 1; as endorsed\r\nupon the writs in 7 Edward 4, only five burgesses, named in the\r\nreturn, chose for that Parliament. At that time, service was thought a\r\nburden, and exemption was allowed by way of reward for loyal services\r\nrendered; thus Richard II., in consideration of the burgesses of\r\nColchester rebuilding and fortifying the walls of their town against\r\nthe king’s enemies, granted them an exemption for the space of five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBeyond the very modest wages allowed by constituencies to their\r\nrepresentatives during their sojourns in London at the three sessions\r\nof parliament, it was generally held a matter of courtesy to present\r\nthe two representatives with a horse apiece to help them on their way;\r\nand expenses by the road, at the allowances stipulated, were added in\r\nwith the fixed pay of so much per day for the duration of parliament,\r\nwhich sum was generally allowed to accumulate, and redeemed at the\r\nclose of the session, when the members came back to report themselves\r\nto their constituents and give an account of their stewardship.\r\n\r\nIn respect of Middlesex, which has been represented in parliament from\r\nthe first general summons of the knights of the shire in the reign of\r\nKing Edward I., a reservation was made. The city of Westminster, where\r\nparliament was usually held, being within this county, the knights had\r\nonly their fees for attendance, and no allowance for coming and going,\r\nas in other counties. “In the second year of King Henry V. (1414),\r\nthe Bishop of London complained that his tenants of Fulham were taxed\r\ntowards the expenses of the knights of the shire for this county, upon\r\nwhich a writ was issued for discharging the said tenants, in case it\r\nshould appear they had not been formerly taxed.”\r\n\r\nThe sums paid to members were in all cases very moderate; but these\r\nallowances appear to have varied even for the same place. The\r\ninteresting “Extracts from the Proceedings of Lynn Regis, 1430 to\r\n1731,” as printed in _Archæologia_ (vol. xxiv.), supply evidence of the\r\ndealings of that corporation with their parliamentary representatives,\r\nas set down in the “Hall Books.” The parliamentary warrant was read\r\nin the mother-tongue, and sealed after the election of burgesses to\r\nserve in the Commons. The manner of election by a committee on the\r\njury principle seems to have prevailed; thus, in 1433, the king’s\r\nwrit was publicly read for electing members of parliament. “And for\r\nelecting them the Mayor called two of the twenty-four (the court of\r\nLivery) and two of the common council, which four chose two more of\r\nthe twenty-four, and two of the common council, and they chose four\r\nothers, who all unanimously chose John Waterden and Thomas Spicer, to\r\nbe Burgesses in Parliament.”\r\n\r\nThe year previous, the burgesses went to parliament in May, and\r\nreturned in July, when, as was customary, a report was submitted\r\nbefore the mayor as to the manner in which the corporation had been\r\nrepresented, and how far its interests had been promoted by the\r\nmembers; when accounts were compared and a settlement was agreed upon\r\nfor wages due, to be raised by a special rate, thus:--\r\n\r\n    “July 23. John Waterden reported the transactions of\r\n    Parliament, at which time was granted by the Corporation half\r\n    a fifteenth, to be paid in at two several payments; viz. at\r\n    Martinmas next, and at Martinmas then next following. That ye\r\n    Parliament held from ye 12th day of May to Thursday next before\r\n    ye feast of St. Margaret, on which day ye Parliament ended,\r\n    and so ye Parliament held for 70 days. And so there is owing\r\n    to them, for their appearance for 73 days, 6_s._ and 8_d._\r\n    for each day, of which they received before their journey or\r\n    passage one hundred shillings, and there remains £19 6_s._\r\n    8_d._”\r\n\r\nFrom this entry it seems evident that these members received 3_s._\r\n4_d._ each. Ten years later, January 10, 1442, two burgesses were\r\nchosen, but, for some unexplained cause, the fees were lowered.\r\n\r\n    “And it was ye same day ordered, by ye assent of ye whole\r\n    congregation, that ye Burgesses chosen for Parliament shall be\r\n    allowed each of them two shillings a day and no more.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, various instructions were given touching renewal and\r\nconfirmation of the Charter; and the burgesses on their return to Lynn--\r\n\r\n    “did well and discreetly declare those things which were\r\n    substantially done and acted for ye Mayor in ye Parliament.”\r\n\r\n    “April 18, 1442. The Burgesses of ye last Parliament\r\n    ingeniously and seriously related several transactions of ye\r\n    said Parliament.”\r\n\r\nAs a qualification to serve, it was, as a rule, deemed essential that\r\nthe member should be “an individual either bearing office or being\r\nresident in the borough,” and persons residing elsewhere were held\r\ninadmissible; thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Feb. 1664. Two letters, one from Sir Robert Hitchin, Kt.,\r\n    ye other from Sir Henry Spelman, Kt., desiring to be elected\r\n    Burgesses for ye next Parliament; forasmuch as ye Statute of ye\r\n    1st of Henry 5 (1413) doth appoint that Burgesses should be men\r\n    residing and free in ye Borough at ye time of their election,\r\n    it is agreed to answer their letter that ye corporation is\r\n    minded to chuse according to ye Statute.”\r\n\r\nIn March, the mayor and recorder were straightway elected burgesses\r\nfor the next parliament, and enacted under “June 20. The mayor to\r\nhave ten shillings per day for serving in parliament.” This specially\r\nhigh allowance was possibly due to the extra state which the mayor of\r\na corporation like King’s Lynn would be expected to support in the\r\nmetropolis, to impress the citizens with the consequence and honour of\r\nthe borough. The fee speedily dwindled again, and, in 1642, when the\r\nkingdom was in a state of ebullition, during the Long Parliament, a\r\ngeneral prescript appears to have been instituted as to the fees due to\r\nmembers, and the possible difficulties of collecting them. It is thus\r\nnoted:--\r\n\r\n    “Oct. 15. An order from ye House of Commons to ye Mayor,\r\n    Aldermen, and Common Council, to require them to pay to Mr.\r\n    Toll and Mr. Percivall, their Burgesses in Parliament, the same\r\n    allowance as formerly per day, being 5_s._”\r\n\r\n    “1643, Jan. 3. In answer to ye above order to ye House of\r\n    Commons to acquaint them that heretofore no Parliamentary wages\r\n    have been paid before ye Parliament ended, nor then out of\r\n    ye town stock, but by ye freemen and inhabitants, saving of\r\n    late of mere bounty ye Burgesses were diversely rewarded by ye\r\n    representative body. Also ye impossibility of performing ye\r\n    said order, there being no town stock, ye revenues not being\r\n    sufficient to defray ye necessary charges in common; besides,\r\n    extraordinary expenses unavoidably fall upon us daily for ye\r\n    safety of this town and ye kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThe Rump Parliament, 1649, had abolished the House of Peers, but some\r\nof the Upper Chamber became burgesses to parliament, and this secured\r\nadmission to the Commons. Lynn Regis came forward hospitably on this\r\nemergency, and the head of the proud house of Salisbury had reason to\r\nfeel grateful for the privilege of being sent to parliament at a time\r\nwhen the order of Peers was abolished through the spontaneous suffrages\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n    “Jan. 16, 1649. Ordered that a letter be written to ye Right\r\n    Honble. ye Earl of Salsbury, by ye Mayor from this house, to\r\n    give him knowledge that this house have granted him ye freedom\r\n    of this Burgh, and that the _comonalty_ of this Burgh hath\r\n    elected him a Burgess of ye Parliament of England.”\r\n\r\nThis honour, which had rarity to recommend it, elicited a graceful and\r\nearnest letter from the new member.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE EARLE OF SALSBURY’S LETTER.\r\n\r\n    ”GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n    “As ye precedent you have made in choosing me to be your\r\n    Burgess is unusual (I believe), if not ye first among you,\r\n    so do it lay ye greater obligation upon me, neither is that\r\n    favour a little heightened by my being so much of a stranger\r\n    to you as indeed I am; and as you have here an open and free\r\n    acknowledgment from me of your kind and good affections in so\r\n    unanimous an election of me to serve you in Parliament, as your\r\n    letter doth express, so cannot they merit or you expect more\r\n    thanks than I do really return unto you for them. You have been\r\n    pleased cheerfully (as you say) to confer your freedom upon me.\r\n    I shall ever be zealous in maintaining yours, and, as I am not\r\n    ignorant of the great trust you have placed in me, so shall you\r\n    never be deceived in it; for ye addresses you are to make me\r\n    (as your occasion shall require) they shall not be so many as\r\n    cheerfully received, and whatsoever may concern the public good\r\n    or yours, shall ever be pursued with all faithfulness by him\r\n    that is\r\n\r\n  “Your very loving friend,\r\n  “SALSBURY.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY LIFE UNDER THE STUARTS; PAID MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days of the Long Parliament were fruitful in frank out-of-door\r\nexpressions of opinion under the rule of Charles I. and the\r\nCommonwealth; but, although political feelings were embittered, it does\r\nnot appear that the franchise was exposed to any undue influence worth\r\nrecording. A certain amount of governmental favour was reckoned of use\r\nin isolated instances; this patronage was considered safe to return\r\nnominees for such places as the Cinque Ports. But few election squibs,\r\npure and simple, can be discovered before the Restoration. Ballads\r\nare less rare; these for the most part deal with the broader party\r\nrelations, and are confined within discreet limitations, for “privilege\r\nof parliament” was rigorously enforced under Cromwell. On the\r\ndisappearance of the Commonwealth, the spirits of the Cavalier wits and\r\nrhymsters revived, with all the more liveliness for their long-enforced\r\nrepression. As an animated and characteristic example of the ballads\r\nproduced at the close of the stern conventicle _régime_, we include\r\nthe _jeux d’esprit_ written upon the moribund parliament, when it was\r\nno longer formidable,--dissolution having, for the time being, shorn\r\nits far-reaching and vengeful claws, while a changed head of the State\r\nhad rendered its return to a lease of power extremely problematical.\r\nIt is fair to say that, for the most part, the disappearance of this\r\nstraight-laced and tyrannical House of Commons was hailed as a national\r\nrelief: the theory of flying “to ills we know not of” had yet to be\r\nrealized with the gradual development of the Merry Monarch’s selfish\r\nand ruinous system, the most iniquitous ever tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A GENERAL SALE OF REBELLIOUS HOUSEHOLD STUFF.\r\n\r\n    “Rebellion hath broken up House,\r\n      And hath left some old Lumber to sell;\r\n    Come hither and take your choice--\r\n      I’ll promise to use you well.\r\n    Will you buy th’ old Speaker’s chair,\r\n      Which was warm and easy to sit in,\r\n    And oftentimes hath been made clean,\r\n      When as it was fouler than fitting?\r\n    Will you buy any Bacon-flitches\r\n      They’re the fattest that ever were spent;\r\n    They’re the sides of th’ old Committees\r\n      Fed up with th’ Long Parliament.\r\n    Here’s a pair of bellows and tongs,\r\n      And for a small matter I’ll sell ’em;\r\n    They’re made of the Presbyters’ lungs\r\n      To blow up the Coals of Rebellion.\r\n    Here’s the besom of Reformation,\r\n      Which should have made clean the floor;\r\n    But it swept the wealth out of the nation,\r\n      And left us dirt good store.\r\n    Here’s a roll of States tobacco\r\n      If any good fellow will take it;\r\n    It’s neither _Virginia_ nor _Spanish_,\r\n      But I’ll tell you how they do make it;\r\n    ’Tis _Covenant_ mixt with _Engagement_,\r\n      With an _Abjuration Oath_;\r\n    And many of them that did take it,\r\n      Complain it is foul in th’ mouth.\r\n    A Lantern here is to be bought,\r\n      The like was scarce ever begotten,\r\n    For many a plot ’t has found out,\r\n      Before they ever were thought on.\r\n    Will you buy the _Rump’s_ great saddle\r\n      Which once did carry the nation?\r\n    And here’s the Bit and the Bridle,\r\n      And Curb of Dissimulation.\r\n    Here’s the Breeches of the _Rump_\r\n      With a fair dissembling cloak,\r\n    And a _Presbyterian_ Jump\r\n      With an _Independent_ Smock.\r\n    Here’s Oliver’s Brewing vessels,\r\n      And here’s his Dray and slings;\r\n    Here’s Hewson’s awl and his bristles,\r\n      With divers other odd things.\r\n    And what doth the price belong\r\n      To all these matters before ye?\r\n    I’ll sell them all for an old song,\r\n      And so I do end my story.”\r\n\r\nFrom the pages of Pepys we are reminded that members of parliament were\r\npaid for their services up to Charles II.’s reign.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that the secretary’s “Diary” would contain some\r\npertinent observation upon elections; he has set down a good deal\r\nupon parliamentary matters that is curious and enlightening, but the\r\ndiary ceases in May, 1669, and the more remarkable election contests\r\ncommenced later.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys was evidently as indifferent as were the courtiers of his\r\nday to the relatively vital importance of the Commons to the State.\r\nWhile accompanying the reforming member William Prynne, who had accused\r\nSir G. Carteret of selling places,[4] from Whitehall to the Temple,\r\nthe diarist in return for the hospitality of his coach, endeavoured\r\nto obtain some information by the way as to the manner of holding\r\nparliaments, and whether the number of knights and burgesses were\r\nalways the same. To which Prynne replied--\r\n\r\n    “that the latter were not; but that, for aught he can find,\r\n    they were sent up at the discretion, at first of the Sheriffs,\r\n    to whom the writs were sent to send up generally the Burgesses\r\n    and citizens of their county, and he do find that heretofore\r\n    the Parliament-men, being paid by the country, several boroughs\r\n    have complained of the Sheriffs putting them to the charge of\r\n    sending up Burgesses.”\r\n\r\nThis conversation was in January, 1668; in March, Pepys describes his\r\ndining with certain counsel retained by creditors of the navy, the\r\nsecretary having been to Cursitor Street to arrange assignments on the\r\nExchequer to the tune of £1,250,000 in favour of these creditors. The\r\ncounsel were pleased to flatter Mr. Secretary upon a recent performance\r\nof his in the Parliament House, and, finding himself with four learned\r\nlawyers, Pepys, with his dinner, enjoyed what he calls “a great deal of\r\ngood discourse about parliament”--\r\n\r\n    “their number being uncertain, and always at the will of the\r\n    king to increase, as he saw reason to erect a new borough.\r\n    But all concluded the bane of the Parliament hath been the\r\n    leaving off the old custom of the places allowing wages to\r\n    those that served them in Parliament, by which they chose men\r\n    that understood their business and would attend it, and they\r\n    could expect an account from, which now they cannot, and so the\r\n    Parliament is become a company of men unable to give account\r\n    for the interest of the place they serve for.”\r\n\r\nAndrew Marvell, member for Hull, who had enjoyed much experience of men\r\nand measures, found fit subject for satire among the corrupt comrades\r\nwho now surrounded him in parliament.\r\n\r\n    “_C._ That traitors to th’ Country in a brib’d House of Commons\r\n            Should give away millions at every summons.\r\n\r\n    _W._  Yet some of those givers such beggarly villains\r\n            As not to be trusted for twice twenty shillings.\r\n\r\n     _C._ No wonder that beggars should still be for giving,\r\n            Who, out of what’s given, do get a good living.\r\n\r\n    _W._  Four Knights and a knave, who were burgesses made,\r\n            For selling their consciences were liberally paid.\r\n\r\n     _C._ How base are the souls of such low-priced sinners,\r\n            Who vote with the country for Drink and for Dinners.\r\n\r\n    _W._  ’Tis they that brought on us this scandalous yoke,\r\n            Of excising our cups, and taxing our smoke.\r\n\r\n     _C._ But thanks to the Harlots who made the King dogg’d,\r\n            For giving no more the Rogues are prorogued.”\r\n\r\n    (ANDREW MARVELL, 1674: _A Dialogue between Two Horses_.)\r\n\r\nFrom his “good discourse on parliament,” Mr. Secretary Pepys, by a\r\nhappy coincidence, straightway betook himself to that palace, where\r\nhe had the privilege of being well received, and in which, under the\r\nStuarts, more curious scenes were witnessed than falls to the lot of\r\neven the average of princely abodes:--\r\n\r\n    “Thence to Whitehall, where the Parliament was to wait on the\r\n    King, and they did: and he did think fit to tell them that they\r\n    might expect to be adjourned at Whitsuntide, and that they\r\n    might make haste to raise their money: but this, I fear, will\r\n    displease them, who did expect to sit as long as they pleased.”\r\n\r\nA truly regal reception, and a most unceremonious mode of dismissing\r\nthe “chosen of the people.” The wits of the day thus tersely summed up\r\nthe situation of affairs:--\r\n\r\n    “I’ll have a long parliament always to friend,\r\n    And furnish my treasure as fast as I spend,\r\n    And if they will not, they shall have an end.”\r\n\r\n    (A. MARVELL: _Royal Resolutions_.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most felicitous sallies were due to the pen of that gifted\r\nreprobate, the Earl of Rochester, at times the _alter ego_ of the Merry\r\nMonarch, but who finally, after enjoying boundless favour by diverting\r\nthe king at his own royal expense as often as at that of his subjects,\r\npointed a shaft with too galling a barb, and flitted away from a Court\r\nwhose vileness he both exposed and shared in equally liberal measure:--\r\n\r\n    “A parliament of knaves and sots,\r\n      Members by name you must not mention,\r\n    He keeps in pay, and buys their votes;\r\n      Here with a place, there with a pension.\r\n    When to give money he can’t cologue ’um,\r\n    He doth with scorn prorogue, prorogue ’um.\r\n\r\n    But they long since, by too much giving,\r\n      Undid, betray’d, and sold the nation;\r\n    Making their memberships a living\r\n      Better than e’er was sequestration.\r\n    God give thee, Charles, a resolution\r\n    To damn the knaves by Dissolution.”\r\n\r\nLater, Pepys is in conference with the king and the Duke of York\r\n(April, 1668) upon no less a subject than “about the Quakers not\r\nswearing, and how they do swear in the business of a late election of a\r\nKnight of the Shire of Hertfordshire in behalf of one they have a mind\r\nto have,” which diverts the monarch mightily.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the juris-consultists who lived contemporaneously\r\nwith the system of “paid members” considered the impartiality of\r\nrepresentatives was protected from outside influences by the receipt\r\nof a small independence; later on we find that, owing to a dispute\r\nbetween the two Chambers, the impression was arrived at by the Peers\r\nthat no salaried judges can be deemed impartial, and that hereditary\r\nlegislators are the only reliable tribunals whence unimpeachable\r\njustice could be secured.\r\n\r\nOn a question of privilege between the Lords and Commons (May, 1668),\r\nwhen the latter took upon themselves to remedy an error of the Upper\r\nChamber, Lord Anglesey informed the Commons that the Lords were\r\n“_Judices nati et Conciliarii nati_, but all other Judges among us\r\nare under salary, and the Commons themselves served for wages; and\r\ntherefore the Lords, in reason, were the freer Judges.”\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of receiving a salary does not appear to have\r\ncompromised the independence of members, but to the contrary, as\r\nthey were thus enabled to keep their honesty the purer, by resisting\r\nthe venal attacks of the Court. The integrity of members seems\r\nto have suffered when their fees were no longer recognized. The\r\n“Pensioner Parliament” came into existence precisely at the epoch when\r\nrepresentatives remitted “their wages;” a significant circumstance,\r\nbut indicative of the times; when selfishness usurped the place of\r\npatriotism, members sacrificed the modest retainers designed to keep\r\nthem honest, that they might be the less fettered to bargain in their\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\n    “The senate, which should head-strong Princes stay,\r\n    Let’s loose the reins, and gives the Realm away;\r\n    With lavish hands they constant tributes give,\r\n    And annual stipends for their guilt receive.”\r\n\r\n    (ANDREW MARVELL: _An Historical Poem_.)\r\n\r\nThe proverbial incorruptibility of Andrew Marvell is a case in point.\r\nThis example of a true patriot is erroneously said to have been the\r\nlast member who received wages from his constituents. He died in 1678,\r\nM.P. for Hull.[5] Others, his contemporaries, maintained the right,\r\nand suffered their arrears to accumulate, as a cheap resource at the\r\nnext election. Marvell more than once, in his correspondence, speaks of\r\nmembers threatening to sue their boroughs for pay.[6] Lord Braybrooke,\r\nin his notes to Pepys’s “Diary,” refers to a case, noticed by Lord\r\nCampbell in his “Life of Lord Nottingham,” where the M.P. for Harwich,\r\nin 1681, petitioned the Lord Chancellor, as that borough had failed\r\n“to pay him his wages.” A writ was issued “De expensis Burgensium\r\nlevandis.” Lord Campbell adds, “For this point of the People’s Charter\r\n[payment of wages] no new law is required.”[7]\r\n\r\nPepys’s later allusions concern the constantly threatened dissolutions;\r\nin November, 1668, he records, “The great discourse now is that the\r\nParliament shall be dissolved and another called, which shall give the\r\nKing the Dean and Chapter’s lands, and that will put him out of debt,”\r\nconcluding with a hint that the subtle and “brisk” Duke of Buckingham,\r\nat that time the actual ruler of the kingdom, “does knowingly meet\r\ndaily with Wildman and other Commonwealth-men,” the while deceiving\r\nCharles into the belief that his intrigues were of a more tender nature.\r\n\r\nAt Whitehall, the same month, Pepys acquires some fresh and rather\r\nsignificant information upon the subject of the Commons; it is imparted\r\nto him that--\r\n\r\n    “it was not yet resolved whether the Parliament should ever\r\n    meet more or no, the three great rulers of things now standing\r\n    thus:--The Duke of Buckingham[8] is absolutely against their\r\n    meeting, as moved thereto by his people that he advises with,\r\n    the people of the late times, who do never expect to have\r\n    anything done by this Parliament for their religion, and who\r\n    do propose that, by the sale of the Church lands, they shall\r\n    be able to put the King out of debt: my Lord Keeper is utterly\r\n    against putting away this and choosing another Parliament,\r\n    lest they prove worse than this, and will make all the King’s\r\n    friends, and the King himself, in a desperate condition:\r\n    my Lord Arlington [being under suspicion, owing to his\r\n    mismanagement of money in Ireland] knows not which is best for\r\n    him, being to seek whether this or the next will use him worse.\r\n    It was told me that he believes that it is intended to call\r\n    this Parliament, and try them for a sum of money; and, if they\r\n    do not like it, then to send them going, and call another, who\r\n    will, at the ruin of the Church perhaps, please the King with\r\n    what he will have for a time.”\r\n\r\nThese passages need no comment, the accepted ideas upon representative\r\ngovernment under the House of Stuart were such as to fill\r\nconstitutional minds with amazement. This view is endorsed by a popular\r\nballad of the day:--\r\n\r\n    “Would you our sov’reign disabuse,\r\n    And make his parliament of use,\r\n    Not to be chang’d like dirty shoes?\r\n                            This is the time.”\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency of the king’s behaviour, and the triviality of his\r\nmind--when applied to matters of business, and especially that of\r\nparliament--is happily held up to ridicule by one of his contemporary\r\nwits, who has thus parodied the expected speech from the throne:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“HIS MAJESTY’S MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n  ”MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n    “I told you at our last meeting the Winter was the fittest time\r\n    for business; and truly I thought so, till my Lord Treasurer\r\n    assured me the Spring was the best season for salads and\r\n    subsidies: I hope, therefore, that April will not prove so\r\n    unnatural a month as not to afford some kind showers on my\r\n    parched Exchequer, which gapes for want of them. Some of you\r\n    perhaps will think it dangerous to make me too rich; but I do\r\n    not fear it, for I promise you faithfully whatever you give me\r\n    I will always want; and altho’ in other things my word may be\r\n    thought a slender authority, yet in that you may rely upon me,\r\n    I will never break it.\r\n\r\n    “My Lords and Gentlemen, I can bear my straits with patience;\r\n    but my Lord Treasurer does protest to me, that the Revenue,\r\n    as it now stands, will not serve him and me too; one of us\r\n    must pinch for it if you do not help me. I must speak freely\r\n    to you, I am under circumstances, for, besides my Harlots on\r\n    service, my reformado Concubines lie heavy upon me. I have a\r\n    passable good estate, I confess; but, Gads-fish, I have a great\r\n    charge upon’t. Here’s my Lord Treasurer can tell, that all the\r\n    money design’d for the next summer’s guards must of necessity\r\n    be apply’d to the next year’s cradles and swaddling clothes.\r\n    What shall we do for ships then? I hint this only to you, it\r\n    being your business, not mine. I know by experience I can live\r\n    without ships; I liv’d ten years abroad without, and never had\r\n    my health better in my life; but how you will be without I\r\n    leave to yourselves to judge, and therefore hint this only by\r\n    the by; I don’t insist upon it. There’s another thing I must\r\n    press more earnestly, and that is this. It seems a good part of\r\n    my revenue will expire in two or three years, except you will\r\n    be pleased to continue it. I have to say for’t, Pray why did\r\n    you give me so much as you have done, unless you resolve to\r\n    give on as fast as I call for it? The nation hates you already\r\n    for giving so much, and I will hate you too if you do not give\r\n    me more; so that if you stick not to me, you must not have\r\n    a friend in England. On the other hand, if you will give me\r\n    the revenue I desire, I shall be able to do those things for\r\n    your Religion and Liberty that I have had long in my thoughts,\r\n    but cannot effect them without a little more money to carry\r\n    me through. Therefore look to’t, and take Notice that if you\r\n    do not make me rich enough to undo you, it shall lie at your\r\n    doors, for my part I wash my hands on’t. But that I may gain\r\n    your good opinion the best way is to acquaint you what I have\r\n    done to deserve it out of my royal care for your religion and\r\n    your property. For the first, my proclamation is a true picture\r\n    of my mind: he that cannot, as in a glass, see my zeal for the\r\n    Church of England, does not deserve any farther satisfaction,\r\n    for I declare him wilful, abominable, and not good. Some may\r\n    perhaps be startled, and cry--how comes this sudden change?\r\n    To which I answer I am a changeling, and that’s sufficient,\r\n    I think. But to convince men farther that I mean what I say,\r\n    there are these arguments. _First_, I tell you so, and you\r\n    know I never break my word. _Secondly_, my Lord Treasurer says\r\n    so, and he never told a lie in his life. _Thirdly_, my Lord\r\n    Lauderdale will undertake it for me, and I should be loth by\r\n    any act of mine he should forfeit the credit he has with you.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “I must now acquaint you, that by my Lord Treasurer’s Advice,\r\n    I have made a considerable retrenchment upon my expenses in\r\n    Candles and Charcoal, and do not intend to stop there, but\r\n    will, with your help, look into the late embezzlements of my\r\n    dripping-pans and kitchen stuff; of which, by the way, upon my\r\n    conscience, neither my Lord Treasurer nor my Lord Lauderdale\r\n    are guilty. I tell you my opinion, but if you should find them\r\n    dabbling in that business, I tell you plainly I leave ’em to\r\n    you; for I would have the world know I am not a man to be\r\n    cheated.\r\n\r\n    “My Lords and Gentlemen, I desire you to believe me as you\r\n    have found me; and I do solemnly promise you, that whatsoever\r\n    you give me shall be specially manag’d with the same conduct,\r\n    trust, sincerity, and prudence, that I have ever practised\r\n    since my happy Restoration.”\r\n\r\nThe commencement of party warfare as now recognized in parliamentary\r\nlife may be dated from the Stuarts, and to account for the designations\r\nof Whig and Tory it is necessary to glance back at the parliamentary\r\ntroubles of Charles II., 1679-1680, when that monarch, acting under the\r\nencouragement of Louis XIV., was inclined to make a misguided attempt\r\nto govern without a legislative chamber. In 1679 the monarch refused\r\na Speaker to his Commons, finding that functionary obnoxious; and\r\nbetween this date and 1681 parliament was prorogued seven times: in\r\nfact--as a summary of Charles II.’s parliaments discloses--the discords\r\nof the previous reign were revived; the “town and country party”\r\npetitioned zealously for the reassembling of parliament, while the\r\nCourt party counter-petitioned “to declare their _abhorrence_ of the\r\nlate tumultuary petitioning.” Those who were urging on the struggle for\r\npopular representation and freedom were designated _Petitioners_, the\r\nking’s “friends” were voted “betrayers of the liberties of the people,\r\nand abettors of arbitrary power,” and expressively stigmatized as\r\n_Abhorrers_;[9] from these two parties, which were ready to exterminate\r\none another, arose the nicknames of Whigs and Tories, as is explained\r\nin Tindal’s “Rapin.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe “Abhorrers,” who were the mainstay of Charles’s utterly\r\nunconstitutional procedure, although as courtiers they hoped for their\r\nreward from the king, did not get much tolerance from the Commons:\r\nwhen the parliament at last reassembled, several members were expelled\r\nfrom the House on this pretence alone, and they consigned to the Tower\r\nthat Sir Francis Withers who had been knighted for procuring and\r\npresenting the loyal address from the city of Westminster; the majority\r\nat the same time recording, as a gage of battle to their opponents,\r\nthe resolution (October, 1680), “That it is the undoubted right of\r\nthe subject to petition for the calling of a parliament, and that to\r\ntraduce such petitions as tumultuous and seditious is to contribute to\r\nthe design of altering the constitution.” The Tories at that time and\r\nlong after maintained the doctrines of “divine hereditary indefeasible\r\nright, lineal succession, passive obedience, prerogative, etc.”\r\n\r\nThat a determined attitude was felt to be fitting is exhibited in the\r\nprotests of the House, printed for circulation, like the following:--\r\n\r\n    “Wednesday, October 27, 1680.\r\n\r\n    “Two Unanimous votes of this present Honourable and Worthy\r\n    Parliament concerning the subjects’ rights in Petitioning.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved, Nemine Contradicente_,--\r\n\r\n    That it is and ever hath been the undoubted Right of the\r\n    subjects of England to petition the King for calling and\r\n    sitting of parliaments, and redressing of Grievances.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved, Nemine Contradicente_,--\r\n\r\n    That to traduce such Petitioning is a violation of duty, and\r\n    to represent it to his Majesty as Traitorous and seditious, is\r\n    to betray the Liberty of the Subjects, and contributes to the\r\n    design of subverting the ancient, legal Constitution of this\r\n    Kingdom, and the Introducing Arbitrary Power.\r\n\r\n    “_Ordered_--That a Committee be appointed to enquire of all\r\n    those Persons as have offended against these Rights of the\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    “London: Printed for Francis Smith, Bookseller, at the Elephant\r\n    and Castle, near the Royal Exchange in Cornhill.”\r\n\r\nFrancis Smith was the publisher--\r\n\r\n    “who suffered a Chargeable Imprisonment in the Gaol of Newgate,\r\n    in December last, for printing and promoting Petitions for the\r\n    Sitting of this present Parliament.”\r\n\r\nHe is referred to with acrimony in the ballads by Tantivy and courtier\r\nbards, among the “pestiferous crew of republican scribes.”\r\n\r\nCharles’s first parliament was, amid the confusion of the time (the\r\nrevolution subverted and royalty restored), barely constituted; it\r\nlasted from April 25, 1660, to December 29th, and, being assembled\r\nwithout the king’s writ, was, with customary royal ingratitude\r\nfor “past favours,” considered by Charles as the _Convention_\r\nParliament.[11] The long _Cavalier Parliament_, some portion of\r\nwhich, like the king, was in the pay of Louis XIV., is stigmatized\r\nto posterity as the “Pensionary” Parliament; it met May 8, 1661,\r\nand lasted until January 24, 1679; the members were doubly corrupt,\r\naccepting money-bribes or lucrative offices from the Court, or being,\r\naccording to Barillon’s clear declarations, in the pay of France and\r\nHolland, as regarded the patriotic members, who fiercely denounced the\r\nvenality of the Court. In 1675 the oath against bribery was opportunely\r\ninaugurated, providing against corruption either from the Crown or\r\nfrom any ambassador or foreign minister. The Pensionary Parliament,\r\nwhich began its career by servile loyalty, and was merciless against\r\nRepublicans, towards its close opposing the unreasonable extension of\r\nprerogative became factious and insubordinate, arrogating to itself the\r\ncontrol of legal procedure, and, according to the opinions of extreme\r\nRoyalists, generally proving itself a “scourge.”\r\n\r\nThe popular view of this venal legislature is given in the following\r\nversion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A PENSIONER PARLIAMENT:\r\n\r\nANSWER TO THE BALLAD CALLED ‘THE CHEQUER INN.’\r\n\r\n\r\n“I.\r\n\r\n    “Curse on such representatives!\r\n    They sell us all, our bairns and wives,\r\n    (Quoth Dick with indignation);\r\n    They are but engines to raise tax,\r\n    And the whole business of their acts\r\n      Is to undo the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n“II.\r\n\r\n    “Just like our rotten pump at home,\r\n    We pour in water when ’twon’t come,\r\n      And that way get more out,\r\n    So when mine host does money lack,\r\n    He money gives among the pack,\r\n      And then it runs full spout.\r\n\r\n\r\n“III.\r\n\r\n    “By wise Volk, I have oft been told,\r\n    Parliaments grow nought as they grow old,\r\n      We groan’d under the Rump,\r\n    But sure this is a heavier curse,\r\n    That sucks and drains thus ev’ry purse,\r\n      By this old Whitehall pump.”\r\n\r\nAnother warning note is struck in the following ballad, aimed at the\r\nreprobated Pensionary Parliament:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE TO BE LET.\r\n\r\n“1678.\r\n\r\n    “Here’s a House to be let,\r\n      For Charles Stuart swore\r\n    By Portsmouth’s honour\r\n      He would shut up the door.\r\n\r\n    “Enquire at the Lodgings\r\n      Next door to the pope,\r\n    At Duke Lauderdale’s head\r\n      With a cravat of Rope,\r\n\r\n    “And there you will hear\r\n      How next he will let it,\r\n    If you pay the old price\r\n      You may certainly get it.\r\n\r\n    “He holds it in-tail\r\n      From his Father, who fast\r\n    Did keep it long shut,\r\n      But paid for’t at last.”\r\n\r\nCharles II.’s third, or _Habeas Corpus_ Parliament, showed a\r\ndetermination to exceed its predecessor in opposing the Court, and\r\nseemed ambitious of imitating that of 1640, the reminiscences of which\r\nwere still of a portentous character, and filled with dread as regarded\r\nthe survivors of those uncompromising times:--\r\n\r\n    “The _Habeas Corpus_ act is past,\r\n      And so far we are safe;\r\n    He can’t imprison us so fast,\r\n      But straight we have relief;\r\n    He can’t deny us aught we ask,\r\n      In so much need he stands;\r\n    And before that we do money give,\r\n      We’ll tie up both his hands.”\r\n\r\nCharles very naturally found this parliament beyond his control, so\r\nit was prorogued May 27, 1679, to the 14th of August, but dissolved\r\non the 10th of July. The whole country was in commotion during August\r\nand September in electioneering contests, preparing for the fourth\r\nparliament. It is to be regretted that electioneering broadsides have,\r\nas a rule, been allowed to perish; they would prove a mine of curious\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe following is a pertinent allusion to the eventualities of the\r\n“poll:”--\r\n\r\n      “But most men did think\r\n      He had not so much chink,\r\n    Nor could pay for the poll of the County,\r\n      And therefore did fear\r\n      It would cost them too dear\r\n    Should they accept of his Bounty.”\r\n\r\n    (_The Worcestershire Ballad._)\r\n\r\nThe opprobrious terms of Whigs and Tories were freely exchanged. Here\r\nis a Whig’s view of the “king’s men:”--\r\n\r\n    “As Rascals changing rags for scarlet coats,\r\n    Cudgell’d before, set up to cut Whig throats.”\r\n\r\nThe wit lay rather with the Cavaliers, though it must be confessed\r\ntheir opponents had the best of the argument when reasoning on facts.\r\n\r\nThe definition of the nickname _Tory_, as it originally arose, is given\r\nin “A New Ballad” (Narcissus Luttrell’s Collection):--\r\n\r\n    “The word _Tory’s_ of Irish Extraction,\r\n    ’Tis a Legacy that they have left here,\r\n      They came here in their brogues,\r\n      And have acted like Rogues,\r\n    In endeavouring to learn us to Swear.”\r\n\r\nBy way of answer, the Tories exulted in their loyalty:--\r\n\r\n    “Let Tories guard the King,\r\n    Let Whigs on halters swing.”\r\n\r\nThe Court party denounced--\r\n\r\n    “Visions, Seditions,\r\n    And railing Petitions.”\r\n\r\nThe designs of the various factions were thus summed up:--\r\n\r\n    “Sir Tom would hang the _Tory_,\r\n        And let the _Whig_ go free:\r\n    Sir Bob would have a Commonwealth\r\n        And cry down Monarchy.”\r\n\r\nThe Tories retaliated upon their antagonists with interest, though they\r\nfeared the zealots not a little, as the following ballad illustrates:--\r\n\r\n    “What! Still _ye Whigs_ uneasie!\r\n      Will nothing cool your brain,\r\n    Unless Great _Charles_, to please ye,\r\n      Will let _ye_ drive his Wain?\r\n    That _Peer-less_ House of Commons,\r\n      So zealous for the Lord,\r\n    Meant (piously) with some on’s\r\n      To flesh the Godly sword.”\r\n\r\n    (_A Tory in a Whig’s Coat._)\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular “counter-blasts” to the Whig pretensions is\r\nembodied in the following parody, which enjoyed considerable favour,\r\nthough not equal to Andrew Marvell’s diatribes “on the other side:”--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A LITANY FROM GENEVA,\r\n\r\nIN ANSWER TO A LITANY FROM ST. OMER.\r\n\r\n    “From the force and the fire of th’ Insolent Rabble\r\n    That would hurl the Government into a Babel,\r\n    And from the nice fare of the Mouse-starver’s table,\r\n                                            _Libera nos Domine_.\r\n\r\n    “From a surfeit occasion’d by Protestant feasts\r\n    From Sedition for sauce, and Republicks for guests,\r\n    With Treason for Grace-cup, or Faction at least,\r\n                                            _Libera nos_.\r\n\r\n    “From the blind Zeal of all Democratical tools,\r\n    From Whigland, and all its Anarchical rules,\r\n    Devisèd by knaves and imposèd by fools.\r\n                                            _Libera nos._\r\n\r\n    “From Parliamentarians, that out of their Love\r\n    And care for his Majesty’s safety, would prove\r\n    The securest way were his Guards to remove.\r\n                                            _Libera nos._\r\n\r\n    “From a Protestant Church where a Papist must reign,\r\n    From an Oxford Parliament call’d in vain,\r\n    Who because Fitz-Harris the plot would make plain,\r\n    Was dissolv’d in a fit and sent home again.\r\n                                            _Libera nos._”\r\n\r\nThe newly elected parliament, the materials of which were equally\r\nunpalatable to the Court party, was summoned to meet in October, 1679,\r\nbut, prorogued during the royal pleasure, it did not actually meet\r\nuntil October 21, 1680. The interval was marked by the presentation of\r\nloyal addresses and petitions for its reassembling. Further prorogued\r\non the 10th of January, it was dissolved on the 18th, to be followed by\r\nthe “Oxford Parliament” of eight days, which was dissolved on March 28,\r\n1681. The nation saw itself on the verge of civil war, and, remembering\r\nwhat it had suffered--while opposing the encroachments of the Crown\r\nand autocratic exactions--from the opposite extremes of anarchy and\r\nfanaticism, the people were resigned to temporize, and thus Charles was\r\nallowed to rule without a parliament until his death.\r\n\r\nThe following satire is well-founded, and pertinent to the prevalent\r\nstate of affairs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE STATESMAN’S ALMANACK.\r\n\r\n    Being an excellent new Ballad, in which the qualities of each\r\n    month are considered, whereby it appears that a parliament\r\n    cannot meet in any of the old months; with a proposal for\r\n    mending the Calendar. Humbly offered to the packers of the next\r\n    parliament,”\r\n\r\n--which, as it fell out, never reassembled during the reign of the\r\nMerry Monarch. The rhymster, after rehearsing the sufficient reasons\r\nwhy every month, from January to December, is unfitted, according to\r\nthe royal inclinations, for the assembling of a parliament, concludes\r\nwith a prayer by way of--\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n          “Ye Gypsies of Rome\r\n          That run up and down,\r\n    And with miracles the people cozen,\r\n          By the help of some saint\r\n          Get the month which you want\r\n    And make up a baker’s dozen.\r\n\r\n          “You see the old Year\r\n          Won’t help you ’tis clear,\r\n    And therefore to save your Honour,\r\n          Get a new Sun and Moon,\r\n          And the work may be done,\r\n    And ’fore _George_ it will never be sooner.”\r\n\r\nThe political squibs of this time are chiefly written by Cavaliers,\r\nand give a one-sided view, from which, however, much may be gathered.\r\nThough not actually election addresses, they refer to the claims which\r\nthe electors of the kingdom found themselves constrained to address to\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\nAmong the collection of “Bagford Ballads,” so capably edited and\r\nillustrated by J. W. Ebsworth, M.A.,[12] is a group of parliamentary\r\nelection ballads, apparently of the date 1679-80, and relating to\r\nEssex, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, and the Universities. The Titus\r\nOates plot; the Duke of York and his threatened exclusion from the\r\nsuccession; the impeachment by the Commons of a secretary of State, of\r\nLord Danby, lord-treasurer; with the opposing designs of the Papists\r\nand the rabid Dissenters; and, above all, the petitions and the\r\ncounter-petitions, seem the leading topics of these satires: but they\r\ndo not contain much enlightenment upon elections, pure and simple.\r\n“The Essex Ballad,” humorously explains the _modus operandi_ of the\r\n“abhorred” petitions.\r\n\r\n    “In Essex, much renowned for Calves,\r\n    And giving verdicts in by halves,\r\n    For Oysters, Agues, and for Knaves\r\n                                  Of Faction,\r\n    One Peer, and men of worship four,\r\n    With gentlemen some half a score,\r\n    Did draw in ten Dutch Ells of Bore\r\n                                  To Action.[13]\r\n    The Squire, whose name does famous grow\r\n    As Marcus Tullius Cicero,\r\n    And keeps true time with Sir A.

Six\r\nvoted, according to a list at the end of the ballad, “for their king\r\nand country,” and seven for Lord Latimer and Sir _Timber_ Temple (the\r\nEarl of Danby, in another version), “for popery and their Town Hall”\r\n(“Sir R. T. his Timber, Chimney-money and Court,” according to another\r\nversion). It seems certain that Sir Richard Temple had offered a\r\npresent of timber for the Town Hall--in fact, some years later he is\r\ncalled “Timber Temple” (“State Poems”)--which was regarded as a bribe;\r\nit also appears that some delay had arisen in its payment.\r\n\r\n    “Our prating Knight doth owe his call\r\n      To Timber, and his Lady;\r\n    Though one goes longer with Town-Hall,\r\n      Than t’other with her baby.\r\n\r\n    “The Bailiff[18] is so mad a spark\r\n      (Though h’ lives by tanning leather),\r\n    That for a load of Temple’s bark,\r\n      He’d sacrifice his father.”\r\n\r\nThe other electors were a barber, two maltsters, a baker, and a farmer;\r\nthe peppery ballad castigates the former, and concludes with a groan\r\nagainst the members returned:--\r\n\r\n    “Thus Buckingham hath led the way\r\n      To popery and sorrow;\r\n    Those seven Knaves who make us slaves,\r\n      Would sell their God to-morrow.”[19]\r\n\r\n“The Wiltshire[20] Ballad,” also belonging to this so-called “group of\r\nelection ballads,” professes to be--\r\n\r\n    “A new Song, composed by an old Cavalier,\r\n    Of wonders at Sarum by which doth appear,\r\n    That th’ old Devil came again lately there,\r\n                To raise a Rebellion\r\n                By way of Petition.\r\n\r\n    “From Salisbury, that low Hous’d Town,\r\n    Where steeple is of high renown,\r\n    Of late was brought unto the Crown\r\n                              A Lesson:\r\n    ’Twas drawn up by three worthy wights,\r\n    Members they were, and two were Knights,\r\n    Great trencher-men, but no one fights\r\n                              Mompesson.[21]\r\n    Through discontent his Hand did set\r\n    First to the scroll without regret,\r\n    Then pilgrim-like travel’d to get\r\n                              Some others,\r\n    From house to house, in Town and Close,\r\n    Our zealous Preservator goes;\r\n    Tells them of dangers and of Foes;\r\n                              But smothers\r\n    The true intent of what they bring,\r\n    Who beg’d the House may sit; a thing\r\n    Which only can preserve the King,\r\n                              When nothing\r\n    Destroys him more; for should he give\r\n    Consent, he’d never that retrieve,\r\n    But part with his Prerogative;\r\n                              A low thing\r\n    Make himself by ’t, the rabble get\r\n    Into his high Imperial seat\r\n    They’d make him Gloriously Great!\r\n                              We trow it.\r\n    They serv’d his Father so before,\r\n    These Saints would still increase the store\r\n    Of Royal Martyrs, Hum! no more,\r\n                              We know it.\r\n    The herd of zealots long to see\r\n    A monarch, but in effigie,\r\n    A project which appears to be\r\n                              Most witty;\r\n    And they at helm aspire to sit,\r\n    There govern without fear or wit,\r\n    King and un-king when they think fit;\r\n                              That’s pretty.\r\n    To see (’twould make a Stoic smile)\r\n    _Geneva Jack_[22] thus moil and toil\r\n    To Lord it in our British Isle\r\n                              Again, Sir;\r\n    And ‘Pulpit-Cuff’ us till we fight,\r\n    Lose our Estates and lives outright;\r\n    And when all’s done, he gets all by ’t,\r\n                              That’s plain, Sir.\r\n    But this, I hope, nor make no mars\r\n    _Charles_ knows what’s meant by all these jars,\r\n    And these domestic paper-wars,\r\n                              Conceive it;\r\n    _Tom_ of Ten Thousand,[23] is come in,\r\n    Sure such a hero much will win,\r\n    On skulls as thick, as his is _Thin_,\r\n                              Believe it\r\n    The people would have power to call\r\n    Parliaments, and dissolve them; all\r\n    Regalias possess; what shall\r\n                              The Saint, Sir,\r\n    Not have the power of Peace and War?\r\n    Religion steer?

B.)\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ Well overtook, neighbour. I see you are not a man\r\n    of your word; did you not promise me, when we last met,\r\n    that you would vote for our old members, that sat in the\r\n    last Parliament, to be Knights of the Shire, to sit in the\r\n    parliament at Oxford.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ I thought to do so, but, by my brown cow, I have\r\n    been over-persuaded to the contrary by my Landlord and his\r\n    Chaplain, _Mr. Tantivie_, and a pestilent fine man, I think\r\n    they said he was a courtier, that lay at my Landlord’s house;\r\n    and what with arguments and wine, they drew aside my heart, and\r\n    made me vote against my conscience.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ ’Twas ill done, neighbour _Numps_, but all their\r\n    artifices would not do, we have carried it by some hundreds\r\n    for our old members, that stood so bravely for their country.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ I am glad of it with all my heart, for, to tell you\r\n    truly, tho’ my landlord had my voice, the old members had my\r\n    heart, and I’ll never do so again.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ I hear most of the Counties in England are of the same\r\n    mind, and all the Burgess Towns, Cities, and Corporations; but\r\n    what arguments could they use to alter thy mind?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ First, I say, they made me continually drunk, and\r\n    then my Landlord asked me so very civilly, and gave me so many\r\n    good words, and fine promises what a kind Landlord he would\r\n    be, that I forgot all your instructions; and methought he had\r\n    invincible arguments to persuade me.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ What were they?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ Nay, I have forgot them; but I thought no\r\n    Counsellor-at-Law, nor any Bishop, could have contradicted\r\n    them: I now remember one argument that took with me; you know I\r\n    was ever for the King, and he told me the King did not love the\r\n    old Parliament-men, and therefore I should not vote for them;\r\n    but I, being bold, asked him how he knew that.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ What said he then?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ Why he laid me as flat as a flounder, that is, he\r\n    fully convinced me, for, said he, if the King had loved them he\r\n    would not have dissolved them. I think that was demonstrable.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ ’Tis no matter, tho’ the King did not love them, they\r\n    lov’d you and your country, and you should so far have loved\r\n    yourself, as not to have betrayed your own interest. What said\r\n    the Courtier?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ ‘Faith he said not much to me, but I suppose he had\r\n    said enough to my Landlord.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ And was this all your Landlord said to you? Had you\r\n    nothing to say for yourself? You spoke rationally the last time\r\n    we were together.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ Nay, I was forward enough to speak I’ll assure you;\r\n    and I told them I was sure our old members would be for the\r\n    rooting up of Popery, and would stand stiffly against Arbitrary\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ What said they then?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ My Landlord laughed at me, and told me I had been\r\n    among the _Presbyterian Whigs_, and bid me have a care of\r\n    being cheated into Rebellion, by those two words _Popery_ and\r\n    _Arbitrary Government_. Then he showed me a printed paper, I\r\n    think he called it _The Mistress of Iniquity_, which showed as\r\n    plain as the nose on my face, that in ’41 they did as we do\r\n    now, and by that means they brought one King to the block, and\r\n    so they would now do by our present Sovereign, God bless him.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ Alas! alas! and that frighted you, did it?\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ Frighted me, ay marry did it, and I think ’twould\r\n    affright any honest man; you know I was always a King’s man,\r\n    and I would be taught to join with those, or give my Voice\r\n    for such, who, under the notion of crying against Popery and\r\n    Arbitrary Government, would pull down the King and the Bishops,\r\n    and set up a Commonwealth again.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ Well, _Numps_, I believe thee to be an honest man, and\r\n    there be many in this land of thy condition, that are not of\r\n    any great reach in policies and tricks of State Mountebanks,\r\n    and so may be easily persuaded, upon false grounds, to betray\r\n    your country, your liberties, your lives, and religion.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ Nay, that was not all; he then read another printed\r\n    paper, with a hard name, I think it was _Hercules Rideing_, or\r\n    something of jest and earnest which I laughed heartily at, and\r\n    methought there were some things called ‘_Querks_,’ which made\r\n    a jingling and noise in my ears, that I thought there was some\r\n    spell in it, for it seemed to join with _Mistress Iniquity_, to\r\n    make all the Presbyterians traitors, and most of the people of\r\n    England mad and factious.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ There is as much heed to be given to these pamphlets\r\n    as to the jingling of Morrice-bells. They are hired to set the\r\n    people together by the ears, and are Papists in masquerade;\r\n    things set up to affright the people out of their senses, with\r\n    the buy leave of ’41; wise men see through them, honest men are\r\n    not affrighted at them, and fools and knaves only are led aside\r\n    by them.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ But don’t we do now as formerly, before the late\r\n    wars? don’t we run in just the same steps as they did, who\r\n    caused all the late bloody doings, as those pamphlets would\r\n    make us believe?\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ I cannot tell what they mean by roads and highways;\r\n    pray Hodge, we are now riding in the High-road to the next\r\n    market-town; before the last Assizes, in this very road three\r\n    or four Highwaymen rode in it too, and robbed several persons,\r\n    and committed many villainous murders, and were at last caught\r\n    and hanged for it; now therefore, because we are riding in the\r\n    same Highway, must we honest men be accounted thieves, robbers,\r\n    and murderers, and all others who travel this road? that’s a\r\n    hard case.\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ You say right, neighbour Hodge, tho’ the gallows\r\n    stand in the highway, we need not run our Heads against it, nor\r\n    do anything to deserve it.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ Shall not the people who feel the burden and groan\r\n    under the oppression, and, having no other way of redress but\r\n    a parliament, desire and petition for one, and cry out against\r\n    such illegal and unjust proceedings, but presently they must be\r\n    termed by these fellows seditious, factious, and such as would\r\n    dethrone the King, and pull down the Bishops? Then all men must\r\n    hereafter be afraid to speak, to vote, or to petition against\r\n    grievances, lest they should be termed rebels, villains, and\r\n    traitors.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Humphrey._ O neighbour, my heart trembles! what a rogue was I\r\n    to vote at random, when our all lies at stake! I did not think\r\n    we had put such a trust into the hands of our Parliament-men;\r\n    I thought, alas, as many do, that we chose only for form-sake,\r\n    and that they were only called to Parliament to give the King\r\n    money, and to do what he would have them; and we have paid so\r\n    many taxes already, and given so much money, that I wished in\r\n    my heart there would be no more parliaments in my days.\r\n\r\n    _Roger._ You see you were mistaken; ’tis the greatest trust\r\n    that can be put into the hands of men, when we send to the\r\n    parliament our representatives, for we entrust them with our\r\n    religion, lives, liberties, and property, all we have; for they\r\n    may preserve them to us, give them from us, and therefore,\r\n    neighbour, we ought to be careful in whom we put this great\r\n    trust, and not be persuaded by our Landlord or any flattering\r\n    Courtier, or ‘_horn-winding Tantivie_’ of them all, to choose\r\n    those whom we know not, and are not well assured of, and that\r\n    we dare not confide in.”\r\n\r\nEqually sound in argument is the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A SPEECH WITHOUT DOORS MADE BY A PLEBEIAN TO HIS NOBLE FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n(PRINTED FOR B. T. 1681.)\r\n\r\n    Parliaments have been wont to take up some space at the first\r\n    Meetings to settle the House, and to determine of unlawful\r\n    elections, and in this point they never had greater cause to\r\n    be circumspect than at this time: For by an abuse lately crept\r\n    in, there is introduced a custom, which, if it be not seen and\r\n    prevented, will be a great derogation of the honour, and a\r\n    weakening of the power of your House, where the law giveth a\r\n    freedom to Corporations to elect Burgesses, and forbiddeth any\r\n    indirect course to be taken in their Elections, many of the\r\n    Corporations are so base-minded and timorous, that they will\r\n    not hazard the indignation of a Lord Lieutenant’s letter, who,\r\n    under-hand, sticks not to threaten them, if he hath not the\r\n    Election of the Burgesses, and not they themselves.\r\n\r\n    And commonly those that the Lords recommend are such as desire\r\n    it for protection, or are so ignorant of the place they serve\r\n    for, as that there being occasion to speak of the Corporation\r\n    for which they are chosen, they have asked their neighbours\r\n    sitting by, whether it were a sea or a land town?\r\n\r\n    The next thing that is required is _Liberty of Speech_,\r\n    without which Parliaments have little force or power; speech\r\n    begets doubts, and resolves them; and doubts in speeches beget\r\n    understanding; he that doubts much, asketh often, and learns\r\n    much; and he that fears the worst, soonest prevents a mischief.\r\n\r\n    This privilege of speech is anciently granted by the testimony\r\n    of Philip Cominus, a stranger,[24] who prefers our parliaments,\r\n    and the freedom of the subject in them, above all other\r\n    Assemblies; which Freedom, if it be broken or diminished, is\r\n    negligently lost since the days of Cominus.\r\n\r\n    If Freedom of Speech should be prohibited, when men with\r\n    modesty make repetition of the grievances and enormities\r\n    of the kingdom; when men shall desire Reformation of the\r\n    wrongs and injuries committed, and have no relation of evil\r\n    thoughts to his Majesty, but with open heart and zeal, express\r\n    their dutiful and reverent respect to him and his service;\r\n    I say, if this kind of Liberty of Speech be not allowed in\r\n    time of Parliaments, they will extend no farther than to\r\n    Quarter-Sessions, and their Meetings and Assemblies will be\r\n    unnecessary, for all means of disorder now crept in, and all\r\n    remedies and redresses will be quite taken away.\r\n\r\n    As it is no manners to contest with the King in his Election of\r\n    his Councillors and servants (for Kings obey no men, but their\r\n    laws), so it were a great negligence, and part of Treason, for\r\n    a subject not to be free in speech against the abuses, wrongs,\r\n    and offences that may be occasioned by Persons in authority.\r\n    What remedy can be expected from a prince to a subject, if the\r\n    enormities of the kingdom be concealed from him? or what King\r\n    so religious and just in his own nature, that may not hazard\r\n    the loss of the hearts of his subjects, without this Liberty\r\n    of Speech in Parliament? For such is the misfortune of most\r\n    princes, and such is the happiness of subjects where Kings’\r\n    affections are settled, and their loves so far transported to\r\n    promote servants, as they only trust and credit what they shall\r\n    inform.\r\n\r\n    In this case, what subject dares complain? or what subject\r\n    dares contradict the words or actions of such a servant, if it\r\n    be not warranted by Freedom of a Parliament, they speaking with\r\n    humility? for nothing obtaineth favour with a King, so much as\r\n    diligent obedience.\r\n\r\n    The surest and safest way betwixt the King and his people,\r\n    which hath the least scandal of partiality, is, with\r\n    indifference, and integrity, and sincerity, to examine the\r\n    grievances of the Kingdom, without touching the person of any\r\n    man, further than the cause giveth the occasion: for otherwise,\r\n    you shall contest with him that hath the prince’s ears open to\r\n    hearken to his enchanting tongue, he informs secretly, when you\r\n    shall not be admitted to excuses, he will cast your deserved\r\n    malice against him, to your contempt against the King; and so\r\n    will make the prince the shield of his revenge.\r\n\r\n    These are the sinister practices of such servants to deceive\r\n    their Sovereigns; when our grievances shall be authentically\r\n    proved, and made manifest to the world by your pains to examine\r\n    and freedom to speak. No prince can be so affectionate to a\r\n    servant, or such an enemy to himself, as not to admit of this\r\n    indifferent proceeding: if his services be allowable and good,\r\n    they will appear with glory; if bad, your labour shall deserve\r\n    thanks both of Prince and country.\r\n\r\n    When justice shall thus shine, people will be animated to serve\r\n    their King with integrity; for they are naturally inclined to\r\n    imitate their princes in good or bad.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    If any man shall pervert this good meaning and motion of yours,\r\n    and inform his Majesty, _’Tis a Derogation from his Honour to\r\n    yield to his subjects upon Conditions_, his Majesty shall have\r\n    good cause to prove such men’s eyes malicious and unthankful,\r\n    and thereby to disprove them in all their outer actions; for\r\n    what can it lessen the reputation of a Prince whom the subject\r\n    only and wholly obeyeth, that a _Parliament_ which his Majesty\r\n    doth acknowledge to be his highest Council, should advise him,\r\n    and he follow the advice of such a Council? What dishonour\r\n    rather were it to be advised and ruled by one Councillor alone,\r\n    against whom there is just one exception taken of the whole\r\n    Commonwealth?\r\n\r\n    Marcus Portio saith, that that Commonwealth is everlasting,\r\n    where the Prince seeks to get obedience and love, and the\r\n    subjects to gain the affection of the Prince; and that Kingdom\r\n    is unhappy where their Prince is served out of ends and hope of\r\n    reward, and hath no other assurance of them but their service.”\r\n\r\nThe substitution of Oxford, “the hot-bed of Toryism,” for Westminster\r\nas the place of assembly for what proved Charles II.’s last parliament,\r\nwas violently opposed by the members, who naturally resented this royal\r\nmanœuvre of cutting off the representatives from the protection of the\r\ncitizens. A petition remonstrating against the change was presented by\r\nEssex and sixteen other Peers; this darkly set forth dangers to the\r\nCrown, and reminded the king of the disasters which had always followed\r\nsimilar departures from the rule of London parliaments. Charles\r\nfrowned, but took no heed. The parliament, forced into submission,\r\nattended at Oxford, Shaftesbury and other adherents taking with them\r\na body-guard of armed retainers, citizens of London, wearing the\r\nAssociation green ribbons, with the legend, “No Popery: no Slavery!”\r\n\r\n    “Who was ’t gave out, that a thousand Watermen\r\n    Had all conspir’d to Petition, when\r\n    The parliament to Oxford were conven’d,\r\n    That they might sit at Westminster for them;\r\n    But ne’er were heard of more than Smith and Ben?[25]\r\n    Who was ’t endeavour’d all that preparations\r\n    To guard the City Members in their stations\r\n    To Oxford; which look’d far more Arbitrary\r\n    Than _Forty-One_, or absolute Old Harry.”\r\n\r\nThe doctors were dispossessed from their seats to make way for the\r\nlegislators:--\r\n\r\n    “The safety of the King and ’s Royal Throne\r\n    Depends on those five hundred Kings alone.”\r\n\r\nParliament met March 21, 1681. Of its short existence of eight days,\r\nthree were consumed in formalities, the choice of a Speaker, and\r\nother preliminaries. The course of the action of the members was\r\npredetermined. They were to insist on the banishment and exclusion\r\nof the Duke of York from the succession. The impeachment was to be\r\nproceeded with of Fitz-Harris, who was imprisoned and awaiting trial,\r\non an information of Everard, for being the author of a treasonable\r\nlibel; it was understood, or at least expected, that the Duchess\r\nof Portsmouth and others of the Court would be implicated in his\r\nconfession. The Lords voted that he should be proceeded against at\r\nCommon Law, by which decision the Commons were craftily involved in a\r\nstruggle for privilege and power with the Peers, who were also less\r\nimpatient than themselves to carry the Exclusion Bill, the Lower House\r\nresolving that “it is the undoubted right of the Commons in parliament\r\nassembled to impeach before the Lords in parliament any Peer or\r\nCommoner for treason or any other crime or misdemeanour; and that the\r\nrefusal of the Lords to proceed in parliament upon such impeachment is\r\na denial of justice and a violation of the constitution.”[26]\r\n\r\nThis squabble between the two branches of the legislature exactly\r\nanswered the king’s occasions; he made this a pretence for again\r\ndissolving the parliament, thus saving his brother and the Duchess\r\nof Portsmouth from the designs of the Commons. As it was, Charles\r\ncoolly dismissed them as impracticable and useless, telling them, “he\r\nperceived there were great heats between the Lords and Commons, and\r\ntheir beginnings had been such as he could expect no good success of\r\nthis parliament, and therefore thought fit to dissolve them.” This was\r\non the 28th of March. On this point the Rev. J. W. Ebsworth, M.A., who\r\nhas edited the “Bagford Ballads,” which illustrate the last years of\r\nthe Stuarts, remarks--\r\n\r\n    “Had they been in London, there can be no doubt they would\r\n    have resisted, calling the City to support them, and voted\r\n    themselves permanent, to the defiance of the King and a\r\n    commencement of civil war. He saw their plan, and conquered\r\n    them.”\r\n\r\nIt was the lesson of “forty-one” to be taught again, as was\r\nprophetically hinted by “the ghost of the late Parliament to the New\r\nOne to meet at Oxford.” In reference to the tyranny of the Commons,\r\nas opposed to the absolutism of the Crown, we find a _Loyal Poem_,\r\nentitled--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED AT OXFORD.\r\n\r\nMARCH 28, 1681.\r\n\r\n    “Under five hundred kings Three Kingdoms grone:\r\n    Go, Finch,[27] Dissolve them, Charles is on the throne,\r\n    And by the grace of God, will reign alone.\r\n\r\n    “The Presbyterians, sick of too much freedom,\r\n    Are ripe for Bethle’m, it’s high time to bleed ’em,\r\n    The Second Charles does neither fear nor need ’em.\r\n\r\n    “I’ll have the world know that I can dissipate\r\n    Those _Impolitick Mushrooms of our State_,\r\n    ’Tis easier to _dissolve_ than to _create_.\r\n\r\n    “They shan’t cramp Justice with their feigned flaws;\r\n    For since I govern only by the Laws, (!)\r\n    Why they should be exempt, I see no cause.”\r\n\r\nThe actual “Oxford Poem” in the Bagford Collection is addressed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON PARLIAMENT REMOVING FROM LONDON TO OXFORD.\r\n\r\n    “You London lads be merry,\r\n      Your Parliament friends have gone\r\n    That made us all so sorry\r\n      And would not leave us alone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE WHIGS’ DOWNFALL.\r\n\r\n    “To perfect which, they made their choice\r\n      Of parliaments of late,\r\n    Of members that had nought but voice,\r\n      And Megrims in their pate.\r\n    _Wi Williams_ he the Speaker was,\r\n      And is’t not wondrous strange;\r\n    The reason’s plain, he told it was,\r\n      Because they would not change;\r\n    He told you truth, nor think it strange;\r\n      He knew well their intent,\r\n    They never meant themselves to change,\r\n      But change the Government.\r\n    For now cry they ‘The King’s so poor,\r\n      He dares not with us part;\r\n    And therefore we most loyally\r\n      Will break his royal heart.’”\r\n\r\nFor a fine, ancient, divine-right-of-kings effusion commend us to the\r\nfollowing full-flavoured High Tory manifesto:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO MR. E. L. ON HIS MAJESTY’S DISSOLVING THE LATE PARLIAMENT AT\r\nOXFORD.\r\n\r\n    “An Atheist now must a Monster be,\r\n      Of strange gigantic birth\r\n    His omnipotence does let all men see,\r\n      That our King’s a God on earth.\r\n\r\n    “_Fiat_, says he, by proclamation,\r\n      And the parliament is created:\r\n    He repents of his work, the Dissolution\r\n      Makes all annihilated.\r\n\r\n    “We Scholars were expell’d awhile,\r\n      To let the Senators in;\r\n    But they behav’d themselves as vile,\r\n      So we return again:\r\n\r\n    “And wonder to see our Geometry School\r\n      All round about be-seated,\r\n    Though there’s no need of an Euclid’s rule\r\n      To demonstrate ’em all defeated.\r\n\r\n    “The Commons their Voting Problems would\r\n      In Riddles so involve,\r\n    That what the Peers scarce understood,\r\n      The King was forc’d to solve.\r\n\r\n    “The Commons for a good omen chose\r\n      An old consulting station:\r\n    Being glad to dispossess their foes\r\n      O th’ House of Convocation.\r\n\r\n    “So Statesmen like poor scholars be,\r\n      For near the usual place\r\n    They stood, we know, for a great Degree,\r\n      But the King deny’d their Grace.\r\n\r\n    “Though sure he must his reason give,\r\n      And charge them of some crime:\r\n    Or else by course they’ll have reprieve\r\n      For this is the _Third time_.\r\n\r\n    “It was because they did begin,\r\n      With insolent behaviour:\r\n    And who should expiate their sin\r\n      The King himself’s no Saviour.\r\n\r\n    “Their faults grew to a bulk so high,\r\n      As mercy did fore-stall:\r\n    So Charter forfeited thereby,\r\n      They must like Adam fall.\r\n\r\n    “It is resolv’d the Duke shall fail\r\n      A Sceptre to inherit:\r\n    Nor right nor desert shall prevail,\r\n      ’Tis Popish to plead merit.\r\n\r\n    “Let the King respect the Duke his brother,\r\n      And keep affection still,\r\n    As duly to the Church his mother:\r\n      In both they’ll cross his will.\r\n\r\n    “They would Dissenters harmless save,\r\n      And penalties repeal;\r\n    As if they’d humour thieves, who crave\r\n      A liberty to steal.\r\n\r\n    “Thus he that does a pardon lack\r\n      For Treason damn’d to dy.\r\n    They’d tempt, poor man, to save his neck,\r\n      By adding perjury.[28]\r\n\r\n    “The Nobles threw th’ Impeachment out[29]\r\n      Because, no doubt, they saw\r\n    ’Twas best to bring his cause about,\r\n      But not to th’ _Commons Law_.\r\n\r\n    “But hence ’twas plaguily suspected,\r\n      Nay, ’tis resolv’d by vote,\r\n    That th’ Lords are popishly affected,\r\n      And stiflers of the plot.\r\n\r\n    “The Commons’ courage can’t endure\r\n      To be affronted thus:\r\n    So, for the future to be sure,\r\n      They’ll be the Upper House.\r\n\r\n    “But by such feverish malady,\r\n      Their strength so soon was spent\r\n    That punning wits no doubt will cry--\r\n      _Oh, Weeked Parliament_!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTS AND ELECTIONEERING UNDER JAMES II., WILLIAM III., AND QUEEN\r\nANNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the accession of James II. a fresh era of parliament commences. It\r\nwas the first object of the newly proclaimed king to secure a liberal\r\nallowance, settled for life, such as would make him independent of\r\n“his faithful Commons.” His late brother having attempted to govern\r\nwithout that section of the legislature in which is vested the control\r\nof supplies, was, towards the close of his reign, getting to the end\r\nof his resources, derived from foreign pensions for the most part.\r\nEvelyn records that within a month of Charles’s death a parliament was\r\nsummoned, and “great industry used to obtain elections which might\r\npromote the Court interest, most of the Corporations being now, by\r\ntheir new charters, empowered to make what return they pleased.” These\r\nliberties were, however, restored in the nature of bribes, the new\r\ncharters granted by the Court being held as considerations for the\r\nelection of such as were reckoned in the interests of that faction.\r\nEvelyn himself discloses this damaging fact: “It was reported that\r\nLord Bath carried down with him into Cornwall no fewer than fifteen\r\ncharters, so that some called him the ‘Prince Elector.’” This was\r\nan “electioneering job” on a gigantic scale, and the new parliament\r\nseems to have been returned on these corrupt principles where it was\r\npossible. On the same authority, we are enlightened concerning another\r\npiece of electioneering strategy, which proves that, as Praed has\r\nwittily told in verse, expediency has ever been proved the ruling\r\npolicy on both sides. Under the 8th of April, 1685, the diary records--\r\n\r\n    “This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were candidates\r\n    for Surrey against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin Sir Edward\r\n    Evelyn, and were circumvented in their election by a trick of\r\n    the Sheriff’s,[30] taking advantage of my brother’s party going\r\n    out of the small village of Leatherhead to seek shelter and\r\n    lodging, the afternoon being tempestuous, proceeding to the\r\n    election when they were gone, they expecting the next morning;\r\n    whereas before and then they exceeded the other party by many\r\n    hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk led Sir Edward\r\n    Evelyn’s and Sir Adam Brown’s party. For this Parliament very\r\n    mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen’s servants,\r\n    clerks, and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were\r\n    set up; but the country would choose my brother whether he\r\n    would or no, and he missed it by the trick above-mentioned. Sir\r\n    Adam Brown was so deaf that he could not hear one word. Sir\r\n    Edward Evelyn[31] was an honest gentleman, much in favour with\r\n    his majesty.”\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of May, 1685, the new king met his parliament (with his\r\ncrown on his head), and the Commons being introduced to the House\r\nof Lords, read his speech, to the effect that he resolved to call a\r\nparliament from the moment of his brother’s decease, as the best means\r\nto settle all the concerns of the nation; that as he would invade no\r\nman’s property, so he would never depart from his own prerogative; and\r\nthat as he would take care of _their_ religion and property,--\r\n\r\n    “so he doubted not of suitable returns of his subjects’ duty\r\n    and kindness, especially as to settling his revenues for life,\r\n    for the many weighty necessities of government, which he\r\n    would not suffer to be precarious; that some might possibly\r\n    suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to\r\n    time only, out of their inclination to frequent parliaments;\r\n    but that that would be a very improper method to take with\r\n    him, since the best way to engage him to meet oftener would\r\n    be always to use him well, and therefore he expected their\r\n    compliance speedily, that this session being but short, they\r\n    might meet again to satisfaction;”\r\n\r\na speech which, in spite of its palpable duplicity, was received with\r\nacclamation by the House. “So soon as the Commons were returned, and\r\nhad put themselves into a Grand Committee, they immediately put the\r\nquestion, and unanimously voted the revenue to his Majesty for life.”\r\nThis ready subserviency is explained, as it transpires, from Evelyn’s\r\naccount, that the new members were not all that could be desired:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against many of the elections;\r\n    and would have had those members who (he pretended) were\r\n    obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of\r\n    their being legally returned: but no one seconded him. The\r\n    truth is, there were many of the new members whose elections\r\n    and returns were universally censured, many of them being\r\n    persons of no condition, or interest in the nation, or places\r\n    for which they served, especially in Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk,\r\n    etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and from the\r\n    effect of the new charters changing the electors, as in Lord\r\n    Bath’s famous western tour, when that nobleman is said to have\r\n    quietly put down the names of all the officers of the Guards\r\n    into the charters of the Cornwall boroughs; whence Seymour told\r\n    the House in his speech that if this was digested, they might\r\n    introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that though\r\n    he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people\r\n    before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.\r\n\r\n    “By the printed list of members, of 505 there did not appear\r\n    to be above 135 who had been in former Parliaments, especially\r\n    that lately held at Oxford.”\r\n\r\nUnder the same date, 1685, Burnet mentions that complaints came up from\r\nall parts of England of the injustice and violence used in elections.\r\n\r\nJames II. got on no better with his parliaments than his predecessor;\r\non his abdication at the Revolution, a convention parliament was\r\nassembled, which ratified the late changes, and offered the sovereignty\r\nto William of Orange and Mary his consort. The political squibs upon\r\nthis topic are not wanting in point:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON THE CALLING OF A FREE PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1668-9.\r\n\r\n    “A Parliament with one consent\r\n      Is all the cry o’ th’ nation,\r\n    Which now may be, since Popery\r\n      Is growing out of fashion.\r\n    The Belgic troops approach to Town,\r\n      The Oranges come pouring,\r\n    And all the Lords agree as one\r\n      To send the papists scouring.”\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, who had effected the Revolution which placed William III.\r\non the throne, were now in the enjoyment of place and power, to the\r\nmortification of the discomfited Tories, whose vexation on the aspect\r\nof affairs, which gave them no prospect of a return to office, found\r\nexpression in satirical attacks upon their more successful adversaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE WHIGS’ ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY.\r\n\r\n    “We who were never yet at quiet,\r\n    Lovers of Change, Disorder, Riot,\r\n    _Old Sticklers_ for a Common-wealth,\r\n    (If you believe us) wish you Health,\r\n    A long, a safe, a prosperous Reign.\r\n    (The wicked _Tories_ think we feign.)\r\n    We, who all Monarchy despise,\r\n    Hope to find favour in your eyes;\r\n    Think you a Protestant so hearty\r\n    As not to disoblige our Party,\r\n    And humbly beg, at any rate\r\n    To be Chief Ministers of State,\r\n    Or else your person we shall hate;\r\n    For tho’ _Religion_ bears the name,\r\n    It’s GOVERNMENT is all our aim.\r\n    We’ll be as faithful and as just\r\n    As to Your Uncle, Charles the First;\r\n    Grant this request, your Cause we’ll own,\r\n    And ease the burden of the Crown;\r\n    Make it the easiest e’er was worn,\r\n    You’ll scarcely know you’ve any on.\r\n    But if (Great Sir) we find you slight us,\r\n    Ourselves can tell which way to Right us;\r\n    And, let you know, by sad disasters,\r\n    Tho’ you are Lord, yet we are Masters.\r\n    This truth you cannot choose but know,\r\n    We prov’d it sixty years ago;\r\n    Yet shall you find us now on Trial,\r\n    Your faithful subjects, OR WE LIE ALL!”\r\n\r\nDisappointment, and a long spell of disfavour at Court, embittered\r\nthe Tory wits, and lent a barb to those satirical shafts which they\r\nfreely launched at their powerful opponents, the Whigs in office and in\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE PATRIOTS. 1700.\r\n\r\n    “Your hours are choicely employ’d,\r\n      Your Petitions all lie on the Table.\r\n        With Funds insufficient\r\n        And Taxes deficient,\r\n      And Deponents innumerable.\r\n    For shame leave this wicked employment,\r\n      Reform both your manners and lives;\r\n        You were never sent out\r\n        To make such a rout,\r\n      Go home, and look after your wives.”\r\n\r\nA poetic effusion, one of the relics of a parliamentary election in\r\nthe reign of William III., was printed in 1701. It is entitled “The\r\nElection, a Poem,” and evidently describes an election for the city of\r\nLondon; the scene of the incident is the Guildhall, where the electoral\r\nstruggle was fought out beneath the shelter of the civic guardians, Gog\r\nand Magog. This production, redolent of the savour of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, is interesting as displaying the nature of “election squibs”\r\nunder an early guise. The poem opens with a brief introduction of the\r\nprincipal performers, and alludes to the scene of the contest.\r\n\r\n    “The day was come when all the folks in furs\r\n    From sables, ermines, to the skins of curs,\r\n    In great Augusta’s Hall each other rub’d\r\n    And made it but one common powd’ring tub;\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ne’er was that Hall so throng’d in days of yore,\r\n    Ne’er were there seen such numerous crowds before.\r\n    From end to end the warm Electors thrust,\r\n    And move like ants in heaps of straw and dust.\r\n    Each busy mortal does his forces rally,\r\n    And from one nook to t’other quarter sally.\r\n    So close they prest, with such inhuman twitches;\r\n    The _Civit Hogo_ did arise from breeches,\r\n    Which thro’ the air increas’d into a breeze\r\n    Made e’en the mighty Giants cough and sneeze.\r\n    Here a fat spark could scarce his tallow save,\r\n    And there a fool was jostled by a knave.\r\n    Came to sweat out their venom ’gainst the State,\r\n    Old feuds revive, and mischiefs new create.”\r\n\r\nThe bard describes the “City Godmother,” an obsolete mistress, whose\r\ntraditions were with the Tories of the past:--\r\n\r\n    “She saw the temper of the noisy Hall,\r\n    And wept the Churches’ stars that downwards fall.”\r\n\r\nIn vain does the antique beldame recall the “bad old times” of\r\nfanaticism and oppression (when in a former reign the civic charters\r\nwere taken away perforce), and exhort the sympathies of the crowd to\r\nturn from Whiggism and embrace the abuses of the Stuarts:--\r\n\r\n    “Poor I, the city Sybil of renown,\r\n    Am disrespected by the nauseous Town:\r\n    Of Innovations daily I complain,\r\n    But, like Cassandra, prophesy in vain.”\r\n\r\nNext comes the hustings:--\r\n\r\n    “When on the _Rostra_, as upon a stage,\r\n    The Candidates their partizans engage;\r\n    You’d think the Hall an Amphitheatre\r\n    And these the furious Gladiators were.”\r\n\r\nThe author first introduces the candidates who were obnoxious to him,\r\nand he certainly roasts them royally, and serves with a right pungent\r\nsauce. Priso, the first candidate to appear before the freeholders, had\r\ndegraded himself as a tool of the late Court, and when in possession of\r\nthe chair had basely surrendered the liberties of the city corporation.\r\n\r\n    “First Priso mounts the stage, and shows himself;\r\n    The crowd unanimous did hiss the elf,\r\n    And vow’d no Representative they’d have,\r\n    Who to a Tyrant their old Charter gave.”\r\n\r\nCandidate number two, Child, was, it is hinted, in the interests of\r\nthe “prince over the water,” whom he was hopeful of converting from\r\npopery.\r\n\r\n    “Next him an infant comes, a Babe of Grace,\r\n    And steps into his abdicated place,\r\n    Where from his throne he, lisping out aloud,\r\n    In words like these bespoke the noisy crowd.\r\n    ‘You’re govern’d, sirs, but by uncommon rules,\r\n    If you elect such men as are not fools.\r\n    In hopes of this, this doubtful stage I enter,\r\n    And at much cost on an election venture.\r\n    I hope you’ve read the letter which I sent,\r\n    Design’d each silly sot to circumvent.\r\n    Tho’ I’m a Child,[32] my parts are come to age,\r\n    And for my sense the monied men engage:\r\n    Both kings and people have esteemed it fit,\r\n    That those who have most money have most wit.\r\n    Men they are pleas’d with great and manly toys,\r\n    But baubles are the true delight of boys.\r\n    I hate of Barons the renownèd Tales\r\n    And recommend you to the Prince of Wales.\r\n    Who in the Senate I will move to come\r\n    Into our Church from the curst See of Rome;\r\n    Where he shall hector like the Son of Priam,\r\n    And be as wise a Protestant as I am.’”\r\n\r\nThe sentiments put into the mouths of the candidates contain\r\nenlightenment upon city matters, as well as upon prominent citizens,\r\nboth under the reign of William III. and his predecessors from the\r\nRestoration. Another candidate is thinly disguised under the nickname\r\nof “the Czar.” He is made to thus candidly address the “medley voting\r\ncrowd:”--\r\n\r\n    “This City fam’d for Aldermen and Mayors,\r\n    The best intrusted with the public cares,\r\n    In former ages have obtained renown,\r\n    Great as the deeds our Ancestors have done.\r\n    I, tho’ of mean descent, and void of fame,\r\n    My ancestors obscure in birth and name,\r\n    By gold ennobl’d, am come here to serve ye\r\n    As once I did my master--that’s to starve ye.\r\n    E’er I a representative commence,\r\n    I’ll make confession here of all my sins;\r\n    I _Judas_ first for my just pattern took,\r\n    Betray’d my master, and his cause forsook.\r\n    This made me rise, as other courtiers do,\r\n    T’ attempt high Crimes, and Villainies pursue.\r\n    _Jemmy_ a special Banker had in me,\r\n    His coin lay safe as in his Treasury:\r\n    It was no cheat his money to purloin,\r\n    He knew not how, alas, to use his coin.\r\n    My breach of promise is so small a fault,\r\n    That no wise man can wonder at.\r\n    But that you might not of my wit complain,\r\n    I’ve been a cheat in every monarch’s reign.\r\n    When paper was equivalent to gold,\r\n    And paper-skulls their paper-credit sold,\r\n    I, by my cunning and my wise designing,\r\n    Soon got the modern art of paper-coining.”\r\n\r\nThe poetaster has nothing but good repute to shower on the late\r\nrepresentatives of the city of London; he bids his Muse--\r\n\r\n    “Tell to _Augusta’s_ sons, the worth disclose\r\n    Of those good patriots whom they lately chose.\r\n    In front of these the aged Clito place,\r\n    A better man did ne’er the City grace:\r\n    Generous and brave, and true in former time,\r\n    When Honesty was thought the highest crime.\r\n    He in the _Oxford_ Senate bravely stood,\r\n    Like some tall tree, the Giant of the Wood,\r\n    O’ertopping all in courage and address,\r\n    Invaded-Rights and Freedoms to redress;\r\n    Brought in a Bill t’ exclude a Popish prince,\r\n    The want of which we have lamented since.\r\n    And when the Chair he did most justly fill,\r\n    And tempted was to serve a Tyrant’s will,\r\n    Would not his fellow-citizens disarm,\r\n    But boldly did withstand th’ impending storm.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He in the Senate sits unbrib’d, and knows\r\n    No cause--but where the common interest goes.\r\n    He, unconcern’d, the dangerous path doth tread,\r\n    Where Faction shakes its dire envenom’d head.”\r\n\r\nAnother favourite and patriotic candidate is “Asto,” who--\r\n\r\n        “early did his country’s cause embrace\r\n    And opposed villains even to their face.\r\n    The Charter he would not consent to yield,\r\n    But did defend it in th’ open field.\r\n    Gold never could his interest engage,\r\n    The common vice of this polluted age;\r\n    Whereby they villains into office vote,\r\n    Such as would cut their King’s and country’s throat.”\r\n\r\nThe other candidates--“friends to their country all,” according to the\r\nbard--are christened “Witho,” “Hethban,” and “Pastor.”\r\n\r\nWith the death of William III. the Tory prospects revived, and their\r\nattacks became bolder. In alluding to the accident which caused the\r\nking’s end, the party lyrists showed no compassion for “a fallen foe.”\r\n\r\n    “Let’s ’em mourn on, ’twould lessen much our woe\r\n    Had _Sorrel_ stumbled thirteen years ago.”\r\n\r\n  (B. HIGGONS, 1702: _The Mourners_.)\r\n\r\nOne of the ballads in the Bagford collection applies to the elections\r\nwhich took place in Queen Anne’s reign (the first parliament dissolved\r\nApril 5, 1705); this High Tantivy effusion of the Tory Alma-Mater is\r\nrather long-winded, and we must be content with a brief extract:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE UNIVERSITY BALLAD; OR THE CHURCH’S ADVICE TO HER TWO DAUGHTERS,\r\nOXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n    “I have heard, my dear daughters, a story of late,\r\n    Told for truth to the Commons, by a Minister of State,\r\n    That the ‘Scotch Act’ was extorted; O England’s hard fate!\r\n\r\n    “If Whigs at this distance so terrible are,\r\n    Such men in our bosom may make us all stare,\r\n    And extort what they please, if we do not take care.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “If this be the case, pray what can you think?\r\n    But that Church and State are now at the brink\r\n    Of ruin, destruction, and ready to sink.\r\n\r\n    “But we have yet a time to save this poor nation,\r\n    From fire and sword, and all desolation,\r\n    By choosing such members as hate Decollation!\r\n\r\n    “And hence I take leave, both my daughters to press\r\n    To give good examples, you can do no less,\r\n    When the Church and the State are in so great distress.\r\n\r\n    “The eyes of the nation are fix’d upon you,\r\n    Every city and borough will observe what you do,\r\n    And if you’ll choose good members they’ll do so too.\r\n\r\n    “Each member that’s chose, serves for th’ whole nation,\r\n    For that end you’re intrusted to vote in your station,\r\n    Without any respect to friend or relation.\r\n\r\n    “The question before you is both plain and short--\r\n    Who is the best man, Church and State to support,\r\n    From designs of the Whigs, and schemes of the Court?\r\n\r\n    “And in your next choice lay your hand on your heart,\r\n    As if upon Oath, for if you do start\r\n    From the rule above-mention’d, your conscience will smart.\r\n\r\n    “A good man is steady, and with safety may\r\n    Be trusted with our Rights; he no tricks will play,\r\n    He loves Church, and the Queen, and’s the same every day.\r\n\r\n    “But if a man be bred up a notorious Whig,\r\n    Who because he was neglected begins to look big,\r\n    And swears for old Friends he cares not a fig:\r\n\r\n    “O trust not to such in time of great danger;\r\n    Who to mother Church is yet but a stranger,\r\n    If Dissenter prevail he may vote for to change her.\r\n\r\n    “And as to the Tackers[33] that have tack’d the right way,\r\n    For the Church and the Laws; to such I do say,\r\n    I will give them my blessing, and for them I’ll pray.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “You are two great props of the Church and the Crown,\r\n    Then be not like buckets, one up, t’other down,\r\n    To expose your dear mother all over the Town.\r\n\r\n    “O no! Pray consider, this is the last squeak,\r\n    Then choose we such men, as can both write and speak,\r\n    Since all that we have, now lies at the stake.\r\n\r\n    “And when by your Daughters such patriots are chose,\r\n    I may venture to say, that ‘under the Rose,’\r\n    You will spoil the new scheme, and wipe the Whig’s nose.”\r\n\r\nOne of the forty-nine verses of which “The University Ballad” consists\r\ncontains an allusion to an important collision between the two Chambers\r\nupon disputed elections, which came about in Queen Anne’s reign:--\r\n\r\n    “O! how were we blinded with what some do write,\r\n    Concerning the story of Ashby and White,\r\n    Till Sir H[eneage] laid before us the fallacy, in sight.”\r\n\r\nThe names first given refer to the disputants, while Sir H---- in all\r\nprobability is one of the University’s parliamentary representatives,\r\nSir Heneage Finch, son of Finch, Lord Keeper and Chancellor. He was\r\nreturned in 1678, 1688, 1695, and also in 1701 and 1702. The important\r\ndispute in question, which is not without interest, as it bears\r\na special reference to election practices which were at one time\r\nprevalent, arose between the Lords and Commons on the occasion of the\r\nAylesbury returns, and the case came before parliament in 1703-4.\r\nIt seems to have been the tactics of those persons whose party held\r\na majority in the House, to decide all disputed elections so as to\r\nstrengthen their own side. “The majority,” meaning the government,\r\nlegislated thus partially, conveniently ignoring the energetic protests\r\nagainst such flagrant injustice--the condonation of direct bribery\r\nand downright perjury, according to the allegations of the minority;\r\nwho, it is said, when the turn of the wheel came which raised them\r\nto power, invariably endorsed the policy of their predecessors by\r\nrepeating the same evil practices. The investigation brought to light\r\nthe illegitimate nature of election returns, proving that it had long\r\nbeen the habit of constables and similar officials to secure for such\r\ncandidates as would pay them sufficiently, their return for parliament\r\nby obtaining a majority of votes for the person who purchased their\r\nconnivance: thus, after the seat was, in advance, put up to the highest\r\nbidder, pains were taken to ascertain in whose favour each vote was\r\nlikely to be given; those burgesses who were not to be cajoled or\r\nbribed into voting for the candidate adopted by the constables were\r\nprevented from voting otherwise, under various pretexts by which\r\nthey were disabled or disfranchised,--an oppression which reduced\r\nrepresentative government to a mere pretence. Yet, although these\r\nglaring illegalities were patent, they had offered such temptations as\r\nto have been condoned successively by either party in power.\r\n\r\nAt length the evils of this system were forced upon the attention of\r\nthe legislature, as certain burgesses of Aylesbury (Bucks) resisted\r\nthe authority of the venal officers which had prevailed unchallenged\r\nhitherto, and at length brought a criminal action against William\r\nWhite and other constables of the borough. One Matthew Ashby had been\r\npermitted to vote at previous elections, but on the recent occasion\r\nwas denied the privilege, as his vote happened to be in favour of the\r\ncandidate who had not secured the official interest. The trial came\r\non, and proved a complicated affair. The constables lost the day at\r\nthe assizes, being cast in damages. Brought before the Queen’s Bench,\r\na majority of two judges supported the constables, although the third,\r\nChief Justice Holt, was opposed to them. The House of Lords reversed\r\nthis judgment, confirming the award of the assizes. The Commons grew\r\nindignant with the Peers at threatened encroachments, and voted\r\nthat Ashby, in prosecuting his action, had committed “a breach of\r\nprivilege”--that delicate offence so swiftly and severely visited\r\nwith condemnation. Lastly, the Lords fulminated their censures on the\r\nCommons for crying injustice; at their order the Lord Keeper sent\r\n“a copy of the case and of their resolutions to all the Sheriffs of\r\nEngland, to be communicated to all the Boroughs in their counties,”\r\nenlightening all concerned upon prevailing malpractices, and serving\r\nas a caution for the future--a proceeding highly provoking to the\r\nCommons, who were powerless to hinder it. They turned their indignant\r\nwrath upon the five burgesses of Aylesbury, who followed suit to Ashby,\r\nagainst White: when their actions were brought against the borough\r\nconstables, as returning officers, for the refusal of their votes, “the\r\nHouse of Commons, on plea of breach of privilege, committed the five\r\nto Newgate, where they lay imprisoned three months.” By a curious turn\r\nof the tables, when their trial came on at the Queen’s Bench, Chief\r\nJustice Holt declared they ought to be discharged, but, being remanded,\r\nthe prisoners were removed into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms,\r\nand the Commons were covered with disgrace by the after-proceedings.\r\nThe dilemma was obviated by the queen interfering with a prorogation,\r\nfollowed by a dissolution on the 5th of April, 1705, which thus\r\nconcluded the last session of Queen Anne’s first parliament.\r\n\r\nThe “loyal Tackers,” who fought so hard to get their own way under the\r\neasy sovereignty of their “gracious Anna,” were occasionally treated to\r\nhard rubs by their opponents, the stedfast Whigs, whose prospects again\r\nbrightened at the close of Anne’s reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE OLD TACK AND THE NEW.\r\n\r\n    “The Tack[34] of old, was thought as bold\r\n      As any Tack could be, Sir;\r\n    Nor is the Age yet void of Rage,\r\n      As any man may see, Sir.\r\n\r\n    “The Tack before was THIRTY-FOUR,\r\n      Besides an even Hundred;\r\n    But now, alas! So low it was,\r\n      That people greatly wonder’d.\r\n\r\n    “If Tacks thus lose, It plainly shows,\r\n       The Spirit of the Nation;\r\n    That we may find, For Time, behind,\r\n      They’ll lose their Reputation.\r\n\r\n    “Before the JACKS[35] were said to Tack\r\n      Our loyal fine Pretences;\r\n    But here folks say, The Humour lay\r\n      To bring us to our Senses.\r\n\r\n    “Religious Laws, was then the Cause,\r\n      OCCASIONAL CONFORMING;\r\n    Did not agree with true Piety,\r\n      And set the Church a storming.\r\n\r\n    “But now ’tis come, they Tack in fine,\r\n      After a great Consumption;\r\n    And therefore thought to have it brought\r\n      In, by way of Resumption.\r\n\r\n    “Thus Projects, and thus Patriots chang’d,\r\n      The House appear’d so civil;\r\n    Both Tacks, which cost such Pains were lost,\r\n      And thrown out to the Devil.”\r\n\r\nIn 1695, the legislature passed a severe act against bribery and\r\ntreating, the first of a series of similar preventative measures which\r\nhave been found requisite from time to time down to our own day.\r\n\r\nThat this act was needed is proved by the records of the immense sums\r\nexpended in corrupting the suffrage. Addison’s patron, Thomas, Marquis\r\nof Wharton, is calculated to have spent eighty thousand pounds of his\r\nown fortune in electioneering. This spirited nobleman, who was one\r\nof the most energetic Whigs, and largely instrumental in bringing\r\nover the Prince of Orange, has been regarded as the greatest adept at\r\nelectioneering which England ever saw, and, says Hannay, “may pass\r\nas the patriarch of the art in this country.” It is certain that his\r\nabilities were admirably adapted to the purpose of exercising this\r\ncontrol. It was his policy “to forward the designs of an oligarch by\r\nthe attraction of a demagogue,” a branch of higher art, which has had\r\nimitators in this age. He managed to return from twenty to thirty\r\nmembers, at an expenditure of thousands, backed by a happy persuasive\r\nknack of carrying all before him. Nor did he stop at an occasional duel\r\nby the way. In the general election of 1705 alone, he spent twelve\r\nthousand pounds. But cash, pluck, enterprise, and activity would have\r\nbeen less conspicuous had they not been supplemented by what has been\r\ncalled a “born genius for canvassing,” as is proved from the “Memoirs”\r\nwhich appeared shortly after his death in 1715. Wharton’s biographer\r\nintroduces the subject of an electoral contest for the borough of\r\nWicombe, at the beginning of Anne’s reign. His Whig lordship having\r\nrecommended two candidates of his own choice, the staunch Church party,\r\nin a flutter of indignation, put up two High Tory candidates, and money\r\nwas freely spent on both sides. A friend of one of the High Church\r\ncandidates being desirous of witnessing the progress made by this\r\ncanvasser, was invited down to Wicombe to watch the proceedings, and it\r\nwas he who imparted the details to the compiler of the “Memoirs.”[36]\r\nThe “Tantivy” party arrived to find my Lord Wharton before them,\r\naccompanied by his two _protégées_, going up and down the town securing\r\nvotes for the Whig interest. The Tory candidates and a very few\r\nfollowers marched on one side of the street, Lord Wharton’s candidates\r\nand a great company on the other.\r\n\r\n    “The gentleman, not being known to my lord or the townsmen,\r\n    join’d with his lordship’s men to make discoveries, and was\r\n    by when my lord, entering a shoemaker’s shop, asked ‘where\r\n    Dick was.’ The good woman said ‘her husband was gone two or\r\n    three miles off with some shoes, but his lordship need not\r\n    fear him--she would keep him tight.’ ‘I know that,’ says my\r\n    lord, ‘but I want to see Dick and drink a glass with him.’ The\r\n    wife was very sorry Dick was out of the way. ‘Well,’ says his\r\n    lordship, ‘how does all thy children? Molly is a brave girl I\r\n    warrant by this time.’ ‘Yes, I thank ye, my lord,’ says the\r\n    woman: and his lordship continued--‘Is not Jemmy breeched yet?”\r\n\r\nThis conversation convinced the witness that his friend’s chances were\r\nhopeless in opposing a great Peer who could display such an intimate\r\nknowledge of the electors and their families. To the said marquis\r\ndoes Dr. Percy attribute the famous Irish ballad of “Lillibulero,”\r\nwhich is said to have had effects more powerful than the philippics of\r\nDemosthenes or the orations of Cicero, and certainly contributed not a\r\nlittle towards the revolution in 1688.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Queen Anne, the arrival of a popular candidate of the\r\nHigh Tory type was welcomed in a stately manner by the supporters of\r\nthe “Church” cause, as appears from “Dyer’s Letters.”\r\n\r\n    “May 5th.--From Exon, we have an account of the honourable\r\n    reception there of John Snell, Esq., one of the representatives\r\n    in the late parliament, an honest, loyal, and brave _Tacker_,\r\n    who arrived from London on the 1st inst., having been met\r\n    some miles out of town by above 500 horse and some 1000 foot,\r\n    composed of the neighbouring gentry, with the clergy, aldermen,\r\n    and principal citizens; who conducted him to his own house with\r\n    the city music playing before him, the streets echoing with\r\n    these acclamations--‘GOD BLESS THE LOYAL TACKERS, AND SEND\r\n    THE SNEAKERS MORE HONESTY AND COURAGE.’”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tories, all who were opposed to the “Tackers” of their\r\norder must be stigmatized to the public as “Sneakers.”\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were equally unscrupulous in the audacity of their\r\nassertions; the fatally damaging effect of a startling calumny, no\r\nmatter how improbable, so that it be bold enough, exploded on an\r\nopponent by way of surprise--a resource much relied upon when matters\r\nlooked desperate at these times of unsparing warfare--is illustrated in\r\nthe next extract:--\r\n\r\n    “May 15th.--The Lord Woodstock, son of the Earl of Portland,\r\n    has carried it at Southampton against Fred Tilney, Esq., a\r\n    loyal and worthy gentleman, which was done by this trick:--that\r\n    gentleman happening to pay his reckoning in that town with\r\n    about 70 Loudores, which he had received there, _the Whig party\r\n    immediately gave out he was a French pensioner, which calumny\r\n    answered their purpose_.”\r\n\r\n    “May 29th.--Since my last, we have had an account of several\r\n    elections, which I leave to the Gazette to enumerate: only the\r\n    management of some of them is worth notice, particularly for\r\n    the county of Worcester, where Sir John Packington and Mr.\r\n    Bromley carried it gloriously against Mr. Walsh, who was set\r\n    up by the Dissenters. Sir John Packington had a banner carried\r\n    before him, whereon was painted _a church falling,_ with\r\n    this inscription--‘_For the Queen and Church, Packington._’\r\n    It was observable, that while they were marching through the\r\n    Foregate-Street, they met the Bishop’s coach, in which was a\r\n    _Non-Con. teacher_, going to poll for Capt. Walsh, but the\r\n    horses (at the sight of the church, as ’twas believed) turned\r\n    tail, overturned and broke the same, and very much bruised\r\n    the _Holder-Forth’s_ outward man; and this raised no small\r\n    admiration that the Bishop’s horses should be afraid of a\r\n    church.”\r\n\r\nThe commotion which in the days of Queen Anne was manifested in the\r\npublic thoroughfares at an electioneering epoch is incidentally\r\npictured by Dean Swift, in his “Journal to Stella:”--\r\n\r\n    “Oct. 5, 1710.--This morning Delaval came to see me, and went\r\n    to Kneller’s, who was in town. On the way we met the electors\r\n    for parliament-men, and the rabble came about our coach,\r\n    crying, ‘A Colt! A Stanhope! etc.’ _We were afraid of a dead\r\n    cat, or our glasses broken, and so were always of their side._”\r\n\r\nAmong the lost illustrations of the humours of elections is the ballad,\r\n“full of puns,” which Swift mentions having produced on that said\r\nWestminster election; for any trace of which we have vainly searched\r\namong the political pamphlets and poetical broadsides of the Queen Anne\r\nera.\r\n\r\nIt is Swift who relates the untoward catastrophe which awaited his\r\nfriend, Richard Steele, the improvident “Tatler,” who, having a design\r\nto serve in the last parliament of Queen Anne, resigned his place of\r\nCommissioner of the Stamp Office in June, 1713, and was chosen for the\r\nborough of Stockbridge, in Hampshire, one of the snug constituencies\r\nswept away by the Reform Bill a century or so later. The Dean writes of\r\nDick’s adventures on this errand:--\r\n\r\n    “There was nothing there to perplex him but the payment of a\r\n    £300 bond, which lessened the sum he carried down, and which\r\n    an odd dog of a creditor had intimation of and took this\r\n    opportunity to recover.”\r\n\r\nSteele’s parliamentary career was brief. He had not been long in the\r\nHouse before he contrived to get expelled, and gave deadly offence\r\nto the queen, by writing “The Englishman” and “The Crisis” against\r\nthe Jacobite Tories. With the advent of his “Protestant hero,” George\r\nI., Steele secured patronage, knighthood, and a seat in the first\r\nparliament, where he sat for the since-notorious Boroughbridge,\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nA deeply designed stroke of electioneering policy is credited to Sarah,\r\nDuchess of Marlborough, who excelled in the subtle tactics invaluable\r\nin these emergencies, which raised her to the level of Wharton in\r\nelection fame, while promoting the success of her nominees. Lord\r\nGrimston happened to oppose her grace’s candidates. Now, Lord Grimston,\r\nas is related by Johnson, had written a heavy play, “Love in a Hollow\r\nTree,” having become ashamed of which bantling, he did his best to\r\nsuppress it:--\r\n\r\n    “The leaden crown devolved on thee,\r\n    Great poet of the hollow tree.”\r\n\r\n    “But the Duchess of Marlborough had kept one, and when he\r\n    was against her at an election, she had a new edition of it\r\n    printed, and prefixed to it, as a frontispiece, an elephant\r\n    dancing on a rope; to show that his Lordship’s writing comedy\r\n    was as awkward as an elephant dancing on a rope.”[37]\r\n\r\nIt was so much a matter of course that everything in a man’s life\r\nshould tell against him, if he had the temerity to stand for\r\nparliament, that Johnson, when interrogated by Boswell, “whether\r\na certain act of folly would injure a friend of theirs for life?”\r\nreplied, “It may perhaps, sir, be mentioned at an election,”--the\r\nduchess’s feat probably presenting itself to Johnson’s mind at the time.\r\n\r\nHannay, in his sparkling essay on “Electioneering,” also relates the\r\nfollowing:--“Mamma,” said a young candidate to his parent in deep\r\nconfidence, one nomination day, “tell me truly, is there anything\r\nagainst my birth?”--an ingenious precaution in view of eventualities\r\nwhich the youth not imprudently employed to prepare himself for the\r\nworst, and that he might not he taken by surprise at the hustings.\r\n\r\nThe Tories were forced, after their failure to proclaim the Pretender\r\nas successor to Queen Anne, to subscribe their loyalty on the accession\r\nof George I. This they did with a reservation, as hinted by their\r\nopponents, who now held the good things of the administration:--\r\n\r\n    “Your fathers, like men, who had thoughts of a Heaven,\r\n    Took the Oaths in the Sense in which they were given;\r\n    But you, like your Brethren the Jesuits, can find\r\n    A way to evade all the ties of mankind,\r\n    So that nothing but Halters your faction can bind.”\r\n\r\nIt was not without reasonable suspicions of the Jacobite party that the\r\nministers of George I. deemed it prudent to keep the Commons they had,\r\nrather than face a fresh election, since a general mistrust was abroad.\r\nFrom an effusion upon the bell-ringing in 1716, on the anniversary of\r\nQueen Anne’s coronation, it appears this tribute of respect to the\r\nmemory of the late sovereign was regarded as a Tory manifesto:--\r\n\r\n    “’Tis Nancy’s Coronation Day\r\n    By whom ye hop’d to bring in play\r\n      Young George, the Chevalier.\r\n    But Fate, who best disposes things,\r\n    And pulls down Queens and sets up Kings,\r\n      A better George sent here.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the lyrist, the papists were tired of praying for\r\nWalpole’s abrupt end; but the conclusion exhibits the feeling then\r\nprevailing--and which was justified by after-events,--that the\r\nprolonged sessions of parliament under the new Septennial Act offered\r\nsome defence against the schemes of their opponents; in fact, the\r\ntables were turned, and the Whigs of this parliament dreaded the\r\nmachinations of the Tories, much as the Abhorrers and courtiers\r\ndetested and feared the Whigs under Charles II.\r\n\r\n    “But now they utter loud complaints,\r\n    And curse all male and female saints,\r\n      Walpole still lives, their curb;\r\n    And four long years, at least, must come,\r\n    Ere French pistoles, and friends to Rome,\r\n      Our Liberties disturb.”\r\n\r\nThe Pretender, whose cause looked hopeful at the time of his “dear\r\nsister’s” decease, was treated by the Whig satirists with all the\r\nridicule their pens could command:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A FULL AND AMPLE EXPLANATION OF ONE KING JAMES’S DECLARATION.\r\n\r\n    “Had my dear Sister still been living,\r\n    I might have hop’d for (the Crown) of her giving;\r\n    But she, alas, is gone, and all\r\n    Her latest servants--I should call\r\n    My friends--disgrac’d and out of power,\r\n    Nay some committed to the Tower,\r\n    _Impeach’d_! Who then but must resent,\r\n    To see a British parliament,\r\n    With all the power of Arms and Laws,\r\n    So zealously oppose my Cause,\r\n    Pay Dutch, raise English troops and seamen,\r\n    And may, perhaps, bring more from Bremen.\r\n    Can my good subjects bear this still,\r\n    And thus _be sav’d against their will_?\r\n    However, if you’ll still consent,\r\n    To damn that thing call’d _Parliament_,\r\n    Burn _Magna Charta_, bring confusion\r\n    On all things since the Revolution,\r\n    Be governed by no other measure,\r\n    But our own sovereign will and pleasure,\r\n    I’ll pardon all, and what I’ve promis’d, grant ye,\r\n    All ‘Oaths of Coronation’ _non obstante_.”\r\n\r\nWhatever prospects the Pretender and his good friends the Tories might\r\nhave cherished on the accession of George I., were abruptly put to\r\nflight after the abortive rising in 1715; this ill-advised attempt, and\r\nthe consequences of its utter failure, are wittily set forth in the\r\nballad:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE RIGHT AND TRUE HISTORY OF PERKIN.\r\n\r\n    “Ye _Whigs_, and eke you _Tories_, give ear to what I sing;\r\n    For it is about the _Chevalier_, that silly would-be King!\r\n    He boasts of his nobility, and when his race began,\r\n    Though his _arms_ they are two _trowels_ and his Crest a\r\n      _warming-pan_.\r\n    When first he came to Scotland, in ‘Our Dear Sister’s’ reign,\r\n    He look’d, but did not like the Land, and so went home again.\r\n    Soon after, ‘Our Dear Sister’ did make a peace with France,\r\n    And then the _Perkinites_ did laugh to see the Devil dance.\r\n    And then to please the growling Whigs, who Perkin could not brook,\r\n    That slim young man was sent to graze as far as Bar-le-Duc.\r\n    But yet when _D’Aumont_ hither came, to tie the League full close,\r\n    Young Perkin tarry’d in Lorrain, or came to Som’set House.\r\n    The Lords then did Address the Queen to do what she deny’d,\r\n    Until Sir _Patrick_ and the _Prigg_ were safe on t’other side.\r\n    Then came a proclamation out, to give five thousand pound\r\n    To any one who Perkin took upon the English ground.\r\n    Soon after _Semper Eadem_[38] this Mortal life departs\r\n    Which thing almost broke _Chevalier’s_, and _Bona Fides’s_ hearts.\r\n    Then Royal George of Hanover to happy Britain comes,\r\n    With joyful noise upon the Thames, of trumpets, and of drums.\r\n    The trait’rous Tory Tools then did cringe to seek for grace,\r\n    And swore to be most loyal lads, if they were kept in place.\r\n    But when the leaders found the King their Treason did espy,\r\n    Away with speed they fled to France, the traitor’s sanctuary.\r\n    This made the High-priest cry aloud,--the Danger of the Church,\r\n    Because those pillars from her slipt, and left her in the lurch.\r\n    Then _Bungay_[39] and his gang, harangu’d the senseless mob to win\r\n      ’em;\r\n    And rous’d ’em up to serve the Lord; as tho’ _the De’il was in ’em_.\r\n    They ‘listed thieves, and jail birds, and rogues of ev’ry town,\r\n    The Ladies chaste of Drury Lane, and _the w---- of Babylon_.\r\n    Depending on this pious crew of ‘Non-Resisting’ Saints,\r\n    They thought by plund’ring of the Whigs to make up all their wants.\r\n    Then to begin the show,--Lord Mar,--that never was upright,\r\n    To summon all his Bag-pipe-men, to Scotland took his flight.\r\n    He sent his _baillie_ Jockey round to summon all his clans,\r\n    With a concert of Bag-pipes--it should been _Warming-pans_!\r\n    He told ’em they might all for mighty Honours look,\r\n    For he that was before a Lord, was now become a Duke.\r\n    They all (he said) should great men be, which was the way to win ’em.\r\n    So he got an army of captains all, and scarce a soldier in ’em.\r\n    And finding of his numbers great, he sent a brigadier,\r\n    To join a band of Fox-Hunters, that were near Lancashire.\r\n    These march’d into Preston town, the women for to frighten,\r\n    And there they show’d their talent lay, in marching, not in fighting.\r\n    They challeng’d Gen’ral Carpenter to run with them a race,\r\n    And troth they beat him out and out, he could not keep ’em pace.\r\n    But Wills with expeditious march these foot-pads did surround,\r\n    And then they look’d like harmless sheep coop’d up within a pound.\r\n    Then Forster got a posset, and gave his priest the Tythe,\r\n    But posset could not make the priest nor general look blithe.\r\n    Then Forster and his perjur’d crew surrender prisoners,\r\n    And show’d they were no Whigs, for they did not delight in wars.\r\n    Then as they march’d to London, Oh! ’twas a gallant show,\r\n    The Whigs bid the music play ‘_Traitors all a-row_.’\r\n    About this time the said Lord Mar (depending on his number)\r\n    March’d up against the brave Argyle, and thought to bring him under.\r\n    But tho’ he had full four to one (which you may say is odds)\r\n    Of Highland Loons dress’d dreadfully, with Bonnets, Dirks, and\r\n      plads.\r\n    Yet bold Argyle, with Britons brave, engag’d him near Dunblane,\r\n    And soon with loss made him retire much faster than he came.\r\n    Then Mar sent to the Chevalier, to hasten o’er to Scoon,\r\n    And said, ‘He should not want a crown, tho’ the Ale-wives pawn’d\r\n      their spoon.’\r\n    But Mar’s design was plainly, when next they went to fight,\r\n    Only to show a _dismal thing_ which would like Death’s-head fright.\r\n    At length the _pale-fac’d Hero_ came, and like an Owler lands,\r\n    Indeed he had much reason, for the goods were contrabands.\r\n    As soon as he arrived, a Scottish ague took him,\r\n    And tho’ he swallow’d _Jesuit’s Bark_, Good Lady! how it shook him.\r\n    The non-resisting Damsels believ’d the omen bad,\r\n    When at first speech the _Baby_ cried, which made his Council mad.\r\n    But when he heard Argyle approach’d with army in array,\r\n    As Perkin came in like a thief, so again he stole away.\r\n    So there’s an end of Perkin, and thus I end my Lays,\r\n    With God preserve our Glorious George, and all his royal race!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nELECTIONEERING AND PARTY TACTICS UNDER GEORGE I. AND II.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fair representation of a chairing scene is given as the second of a\r\nseries of eight plates which, under the title of “Robin’s Progress,”\r\nsatirically delineates the career of Sir Robert Walpole. The newly\r\nelected member is seated, tranquilly enough, in a capacious arm-chair,\r\nraised aloft by his supporters; there are a few “bludgeon-men” among\r\nhis followers. Hats are thrown into the air, and a general sense of\r\nsatisfaction is shown to prevail. One of the party, evidently a person\r\nof influence, is made to exclaim, “No bribery, no corruption!” A group\r\nof more distrustful persons is pictured in the foreground; an elector\r\nobserves, “I wish we mayn’t be deceived,” while his confederate is\r\ndeclaring, “I smell a rat!” Whatever “undue influence” might have been\r\nhinted on this occasion, Walpole had not at that early date (1701)\r\ndeveloped the arts of corruption and electioneering, then synonymous;\r\nhis proficiency in these branches was of later growth. Although not\r\nstrictly a contemporaneous picture of the event, the engraving which\r\nrepresents the chairing of Sir Robert Walpole on his election for\r\nCastle Rising, Norfolk, in 1701, is the earliest of our election\r\nillustrations as regards the date of the incident depicted. Walpole,\r\nin succession to his father, sat for Castle Rising, in the last two\r\nshort parliaments which preceded the death of William III., and at once\r\ndistinguished himself as an active and able ally of the Whig party,\r\nthen holding the power of administration. In 1702, he was chosen member\r\nfor King’s Lynn, and represented that borough in several successive\r\nparliaments. After, with the interest of George, Prince of Denmark,\r\nfilling the posts of secretary at war, 1708, and treasurer of the\r\nnavy, 1709, the Tory advisers of the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign\r\ndismissed Walpole from all his posts. The Commons in 1711 voting him\r\nguilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption in his office\r\nas secretary at war, it was resolved to expel him from the House,\r\nand that he should be committed to the Tower. Under this vindictive\r\npersecution, he was, by his party, regarded as a martyr to the cause,\r\nnor does there appear sufficient proof to justify this severity.\r\nEncouraged by Walpole’s energetic tactics, his constituents remained\r\nfirm, and he was re-elected by the burgesses of Lynn in 1713-14, and,\r\nthough the House declared the return void, yet the electors persisted\r\nin their choice, and Walpole took a decided part against the queen’s\r\nTory ministry, until “the turn of the wheel,” which raised the Elector\r\nof Hanover on the English throne as Queen Anne’s successor, threw\r\nback the power of administration into the hands of Walpole and the\r\nWhigs, and once more reduced the Tories to vent their mortification in\r\nunscrupulous attacks and misrepresentations, while they were themselves\r\nexerting all their abilities for the subversion of the House of Hanover\r\nand the restoration of the exiled Stuarts. The bitterness of party\r\nwarfare was mostly manifested at election times. A burlesque “Bill of\r\nCosts” was printed in the _Flying Post_ (Jan. 27, 1715), “for a late\r\nTory election in the West,” in which part of the country the Tory\r\ninterest was strongest:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALPOLE CHAIRED. 1701.

Violence was now\r\nutilized in new methods, such as beating off voters of opposition\r\ncandidates; while hostile electors were surrounded by mobs hired for\r\nthe purpose, and cut off from the polling-booths; and in some cases\r\nvoters were carried off forcibly, and locked up until the election was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIn country boroughs much agitation was manifested, and in several\r\nplaces, such as Coventry, formidable riots took place.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis shared the general excitement. It was on this occasion\r\nthat the Westminster contest began to be regarded as of the first\r\nconsequence, it being a point of ambition with the rival parties to\r\nreturn their candidates for this constituency, the results of which\r\nconflict were expected to exercise an influence upon other places.\r\nThe election for this city set in uproariously in 1721, and, as the\r\nprogress of these electioneering memorials will demonstrate, it\r\ncontinued the same throughout its history, even when in other places\r\nthe elections were tranquil and uneventful.\r\n\r\nThe Tories did not allow Walpole to triumph without a struggle for the\r\nascendency, although, by his foresight, and a lavish employment of his\r\nuniversal salve--gold, he managed to diminish the influence both of his\r\nopponents and of the mobocracy; and in the new House the Government\r\nsecured a powerful majority, leaving the Tory organs, towards the close\r\nof the elections, when the results were no longer doubtful, to vent\r\ntheir spleen in political squibs and caricatures. Thus, on the 31st of\r\nMarch, the _Post Boy_ announces two satirical prints--one, “Britannia\r\nstript by a Villain, to which is added, the True Phiz of a Late\r\nMember,” which seems to have disappeared completely; and the other,\r\n“The Prevailing Candidate; or the Election carried by Bribery and the\r\nD----l;” which, according to all accounts, is the earliest existing\r\ncontemporary caricature upon the subject of electioneering; and is,\r\nmoreover, one of the best examples of these productions as published in\r\nthe reign of George I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PREVAILING CANDIDATE; OR THE ELECTION CARRIED BY\r\nBRIBERY AND THE D----L. (Dr. Newton’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe candidate, it is implied, is a Court nominee; the screen is used\r\nto conceal the true movers of the wires, who are at the back of the\r\ncanvasser; their reflection is shown in the mirror behind, above\r\nthe console-table, on which bags of money are in readiness to be\r\nused for bribery. The wooden shoes symbolize a threatened relapse\r\nto slavery. The screen is to typify the seven years of the last\r\nparliament--the first of the septennial parliaments; the year 1716 is\r\nmarked “Septennial Act”--“Part of the Succession Act repealed;”--1720\r\nregisters the “South Sea Act,”--“Act to indemnify South Sea Villains;”\r\nand 1721 the “Quarantine Act, _cum multis aliis_;” the other years are\r\nblanks. The accompanying verses explain the meaning intended to be\r\nconveyed by the principal figures. The personage bribed is the mayor of\r\nthe place. These functionaries for a long time held the elections in\r\ntheir power, and were amenable to corrupt treatment; in fact, they were\r\nexpected to make the bargain most advantageous for the court of livery\r\nor aldermen, in whom the votes were generally vested. Hence the old\r\nsaying, “Money makes the mayor to go.”\r\n\r\n    “Here’s a minion sent down to a corporate town,\r\n      In hopes to be newly elected;\r\n    By his prodigal show, you may easily know\r\n      To the Court he is truly affected.\r\n\r\n    “He ’as a knave by the hand, who has power to command\r\n      All the votes in the corporation;\r\n    Shoves a sum in his pocket, the D----l cries ‘Take it,\r\n      ’Tis all for the good of the nation!’\r\n\r\n    “The wife, standing by, looks a little awry\r\n      At the candidate’s way of addressing;\r\n    But a priest stepping in avers bribery no sin,\r\n      Since money’s a family blessing.\r\n\r\n    “Say the boys, ‘Ye sad rogues, here are French wooden brogues,\r\n      To reward your vile treacherous knavery;\r\n    For such traitors as you are the rascally crew\r\n      That betray the whole kingdom to slavery.’”\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1727, in spite of the exertions of Bolingbroke and\r\nPulteney in the _Craftsman_, and the intrigues of the former with the\r\nDuchess of Kendal, mistress of George I., were a disappointment to the\r\nTories and “patriots,” _i.e._ Jacobites. On the death of George I.\r\ntheir prospects were even less promising. Queen Caroline, the consort\r\nof George II., was the steadfast friend of Walpole, and although the\r\nBolingbroke faction paid their court to the mistress of the new king,\r\nas they had done in the last reign to that of his predecessor, they\r\ngained nothing by their motion, as George II. was governed by his wife\r\nin political questions. The hopes placed by the Tories in the elections\r\nwere altogether frustrated; in the parliament chosen in 1727 the\r\nministerial majority was greater than before, and their opponents were\r\nreduced to vent their mortification in strictures against the bribery,\r\ncorruption, undue influence, and those secret intrigues in which they\r\nwere themselves such adepts.\r\n\r\nOf the few caricatures to which this contest gave rise that best known\r\nis entitled “Ready Money the Prevailing Candidate; or the Humours\r\nof an Election;” and even in this the satirical allusions appear to\r\nhave a general rather than a specific application. This picture,\r\nlike most of the caricatures of the time, is slightly allegorical;\r\nthe scene is evidently the outskirts of a town; colossal statues of\r\n“Folly” and “Justice” are shown at either side. As the title implies,\r\nbribery is the motive power of the entire action. In the centre is\r\na figure with his back to the spectator; the rear of this person’s\r\ncoat is covered with pockets, into which those interested in the\r\nwork of buying votes are dropping money; the recipient is declaring,\r\n“No bribery, but pockets are free.” Another gentleman, with his hat\r\nraised in the air, is crying, “Sell not your country.” A whole body\r\nof electors behind these plausible individuals are standing ready to\r\nbe bought; an agent is canvassing this group for their votes, with a\r\nmoney-bag to meet their requirements. To the right, a man is kneeling\r\nto secure a heap of pieces, which are lavishly scattered about, while\r\nanother person is stooping to press a well-filled bag of money upon\r\nhis acceptance as “a small acknowledgment.” One of the candidates,\r\nhandsomely attired, and with a feathered hat, is carried on a litter by\r\nfour bearers, much like “Chairing a member;” he has bags of money in\r\nboth hands, and his progress is marked by a shower of gold “for his\r\ncountry’s service.” At the door of an inn stands a figure whose head is\r\nsupplemented with antlers--“He kissed my wife, he shall have my vote!”\r\n“Folly” is personated by a male effigy, also emptying out money-bags\r\nto his votaries: before his altar a candidate is kneeling amidst his\r\ncanvassing tickets; he is exclaiming, “Help me, Folly, or my cause is\r\nlost.” In the foreground is the figure of an ancient philosopher, who\r\nis made to say, “Let not thy right hand know what thy left does;” his\r\nleft hand is accommodatingly held behind his back, and this an agent\r\nis filling with pieces. A person dressed like a Covenanter is crying,\r\n“See here, see here!” The emblematical figure of “Justice,” blind, and\r\nwith her attributes of sword and scales, has her altar deserted. One\r\nman is admonishing his neighbour to “Regard Justice;” the other, who\r\nhas a sack of unlawful treasure on his shoulder, replies, “We fell out:\r\nI lost money by her.” A modishly dressed candidate, hat in hand, is\r\npressing a bag of money on another individual, who seems to have been\r\nbribed already, but is willing to accept further emoluments--“’Twill\r\nscarce pay, make it twenty more.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O Cives!

(Dr. Newton’s Collection.)\r\n\r\n  [_Page 84._]\r\n\r\nA copy of verses sets forth the morality of this plate:--\r\n\r\n    “The Laws against Bribery provision may make,\r\n    Yet means will be found both to give and to take;\r\n    While charms are in flattery, and power in gold,\r\n    Men will be corrupted and Liberty sold.\r\n    When a candidate interest is making for votes,\r\n    How cringing he seems to the arrantest sots!\r\n    ‘Dear Sir, how d’ye do? I am joyful to see ye!\r\n    How fares your good spouse? and how goes the world wi’ ye?\r\n    Can I serve you in anything? Faith, Sir, I’ll do’t\r\n    If you’ll be so kind as to give me your vote.\r\n    Pray do me the honour an evening to pass\r\n    In smoking a pipe and in taking a glass!’\r\n      Away to the tavern they quickly retire,\r\n    The ploughman’s ‘Hail-fellow-well-met’ with the Squire;\r\n    Of his company proud, he ‘huzzas’ and he drinks,\r\n    And himself a great man of importance he thinks:\r\n    He struts with the gold newly put in his breeches,\r\n    And dreams of vast favours and mountains of riches.\r\n    But as soon as the day of Election is over,\r\n    His woeful mistake he begins to discover;\r\n    The Squire is a Member--the rustic who chose him\r\n    Is now quite neglected--he no longer knows him.\r\n    Then Britons! betray not a sordid vile spirit\r\n    Contemn gilded baits, and elect men of merit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KENTISH ELECTION, 1734.]\r\n\r\nA realistic version of the hustings appeared under the title of “The\r\nKentish Election, 1734.” The locality of the gathering here represented\r\nis probably Maidstone in Kent. A large open space on the outskirts of\r\nthe town is the scene of action. The candidates and their numerous\r\nsupporters are raised above the multitude, and standing on the\r\nhustings. Round this erection is a great crowd of electors, many of\r\nwhom are on horseback.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground, a mounted clergyman is at the head of a procession\r\nof his flock, all wearing favours in their hats, and professing\r\nthemselves supporters of the “Protestant Interest,” _i.e._ Whigs;\r\ntwo of them carry staves and books; the “gauges” in their hands seem\r\nto indicate that they are gaugers or excisemen, _i.e._ placemen:\r\nit must be noted that the chief grievance against Walpole and his\r\nadministration at this time was the attempt to tax tobacco and wines.\r\nThe Opposition party-cry is “No Excise,” with the names of “Vane and\r\nDering,” the successful candidates, in whose honour, with that of the\r\n“Country Interest,” _i.e._ Tories, which they had pledged themselves\r\nto promote, the followers of their party wear sprigs of oak in their\r\nhats--a memorial of the Restoration of the Stuarts. The party-cry\r\nof their antagonists is for “King and Country,” and “Middlesex and\r\nOxenden.” Sir George Oxenden had voted for the Government and in favour\r\nof the Excise Bill; he sat for Maidstone before the dissolution, April,\r\n1734. The Earl of Middlesex was not a member of the former Parliament.\r\nThese gentlemen finally threw up the poll, the victory of their\r\nopponents being assured, May 16, 1734. Of the successful candidates,\r\nViscount Vane and Sir Edward Dering, the former had voted against the\r\nExcise Bill, and the latter was absent on the division. Something in\r\nthe way of influencing suffrages seems to have been done on a large\r\nscale by Viscount Vane. Two hogsheads of French brandy were sent down\r\nto his seat in Kent (according to the _Daily Post_), together with\r\nsixty dozen of knives and forks, in preparation for the entertainment\r\nhis lordship offered the freeholders. _The Grub Street Journal_ devotes\r\nsome attention to the treats with which the successful candidates\r\nregaled their constituents at an early stage of their canvass, and\r\nthese hospitalities were returned in kind.\r\n\r\n“At a meeting lately at the _Swan Tavern_ in Cornhill, of about 100\r\nsubstantial worthy citizens of London, freeholders of the County\r\nof Kent, the Right Hon. the Lord Vane and Sir Edw. Dering, Bart.,\r\ncandidates in the Country Interest, were entertained in an elegant\r\nmanner by the freeholders,” etc. It is further stated that “these\r\ncandidates were met at about two miles from Westerham, in Kent, by 300\r\nfreeholders on horseback, and dined at the _George Inn_, where healths\r\nwere drunk to the glorious 205”--this being the number of members whose\r\nvotes placed the Government in a minority upon the Excise Bill. Nor\r\nwas wanting what later statesmen have termed “the fine old English\r\nInstitution” of parading the Minister in effigy.\r\n\r\n    “The populace, to show their zeal on this occasion, dressed\r\n    up a figure of a certain Excise gentleman (Sir Robert Walpole\r\n    to wit) with blue paper round his shoulders (intended for the\r\n    riband of the Garter, always alluded to with spite by the prime\r\n    minister’s adversaries), a pipe in his mouth (Tobacco Bill),\r\n    and several Florence flasks about his neck (referring to the\r\n    proposed duty on wines), then mounted him upon a mule, and led\r\n    him round the town in procession.” (_The Grub Street Journal._)\r\n\r\nOn the same authority (No. 230), under date Wednesday, May 23, 1734, is\r\nannounced the sudden demise of the leading candidate: “On Monday, about\r\nfive in the afternoon, the Right Hon. the Lord Visc. Vane dropt down\r\ndead of an apoplexy, just as he was taking leave of a gentleman, at his\r\nseat at Fairlawn in Kent” (_Daily Post_).\r\n\r\nAn early design upon bribery at elections is attributed to Hogarth.\r\nThis plate was produced during the canvass in 1734, just twenty years\r\nbefore the commencement of the famous “Election” series by the same\r\nartist. The print is a small etching, and represents Sir Robert Fagg,\r\nan old baronet, seated on horseback, holding a purse in one hand, and\r\noffering a bribe of money to a young woman who is standing by his\r\nhorse’s head; on her arm is a basket of eggs; she is laughing at the\r\ncanvasser. Sir Robert Fagg was member for Steyning, Sussex. Concerning\r\nthe baronet it is written, in “The Art of Politicks”--\r\n\r\n    “Leave you of mighty Interest to brag,\r\n    And poll two voices like _Sir Robert Fagg_.”\r\n\r\n“The Humours of a Country Election,” of which the first version\r\nappeared in 1734, beyond the light it offers upon the subject in\r\nquestion, is curious and interesting, as Mr. F. G. Stephens is inclined\r\nto suggest[40] that Hogarth may have borrowed the idea of illustrating\r\nthe chief incidents of an election from the “Humours” therein\r\ndescribed. The plate is in three divisions, and forms the frontispiece\r\nto the collection of songs published under the title of “the Humours\r\nof a Country Election” in 1734, at which time there was a general\r\nelection; it was republished in 1741,[41] under similar circumstances.\r\nThe print is sufficiently described by the original advertisement,\r\ninserted at the time of its publication in the _Grub Street Journal_\r\n(No. 233), June 13, 1734. “_This Day is publish’d_ (Price One\r\nShilling), Neatly printed, and _stitched in blue paper_, ‘The Humours\r\nof a Country Election.’”\r\n\r\n    “Being mounted in their best array,\r\n    Upon a steed, and who but they?\r\n    And follow’d by a world of tall lads\r\n    That merry ditties, frolics and ballads,\r\n    Did ride with many a Good-morrow,\r\n    Crying, Hey for our Town, thro’ the Borough.”\r\n\r\n  (_Hudibras._)\r\n\r\n    “A motley mixture! in long wigs, in bags,\r\n    In silks, in crapes, in Garters, and in rags;\r\n    From Drawing-rooms, from Colleges, from Garrets,\r\n    On horse, on foot, in Hacks, in gilded Chariots.”\r\n\r\n  (_Grub Street Journal_, No. 268. Also in the Poems Edition.)\r\n\r\n“With a curious frontispiece explanatory of the same in the following\r\nparticulars:--\r\n\r\n“I. The candidate welcomed into the town by music and electors\r\non horseback, attended by a mob of men, women, and children. The\r\ncandidates saluting the women, and amongst them a poor cobbler’s wife,\r\nto whose child they very courteously offer to stand God-father. II.\r\nThe candidates are very complaisant to a country clown, and offering\r\npresents (a bag marked 50_l._) to the wife and children. The candidates\r\nmaking an entertainment for the electors and their wives, to whom\r\nthey show great respect; at the upper end of the table the parson\r\nof the parish sitting, his clerk standing by him. III. The place of\r\nelecting and polling, with mob attending. The members elect carried in\r\nprocession in chairs, upon men’s shoulders, with music playing before\r\nthem; attended by a mob of men, women, and children huzzaing them. To\r\nwhich is added the character of a Trimmer in verse, &c.”\r\n\r\n“A new Year’s Gift (for the year 1741) to the Electors of Great\r\nBritain,” contains the information that “The Oath imposed upon\r\nElectors--the only preservative of public Liberty from the secret and\r\nfatal attacks of Bribery and Corruption,” was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “‘I, ---- ----, do swear, I have not received, or had myself,\r\n    or any person whatsoever, in Trust for me, or for my Use and\r\n    Benefit, directly or indirectly, any sum or sums of money,\r\n    Office, Place, or employment, gift, or reward, or any promise,\r\n    or security for any money, office, employment, or gift, in\r\n    order to give my vote at this Election, and that I have not\r\n    been polled before at this Election,\r\n\r\n  ‘So Help me God.’\r\n\r\n    “Let every man of common sense judge whether an oath so\r\n    wisely framed and strictly worded can possibly admit of any\r\n    equivocation, to cover the base villainy of taking a bribe\r\n    to his country’s ruin; and what shall we think of those men\r\n    who dare tempt others to the breach of a duty so sacred!\r\n    Ought they not to be stoned, or hooted out of society, as the\r\n    destroyers of public Faith, Virtue, Religion, and Liberty?\r\n    Do not such agents for the Devil compass his ends most\r\n    effectually, by seducing men from the indispensable duties they\r\n    owe to God and their country, to themselves and their posterity?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUMOURS OF A COUNTRY ELECTION. 1734.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 90._]\r\n\r\n    “Wisely, therefore, hath that good Law annexed the shameful\r\n    penalties of the pillory to the breach of that Sacred Oath,\r\n    with a large Fine of Five Hundred Pounds; and justly excluded\r\n    all base perjurers from the most valuable Rights and Privileges\r\n    of _Englishmen_, in the following paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n    “‘And be it enacted, That whosoever shall be convicted of false\r\n    swearing, shall incur and suffer the Pains and Penalties as in\r\n    a case of wilful and corrupt Perjury.\r\n\r\n    “And whosoever shall receive or take any money or other reward,\r\n    by way of Gift, Loan, or other device, or agree or contract\r\n    for any Money, Gift, Office, or Reward whatsoever, to give his\r\n    vote, shall for every such offence forfeit the sum of Five\r\n    Hundred Pounds, and be _for ever_ disabled to vote in any\r\n    Election of any Member to Parliament, and be for ever disabled\r\n    to hold any public office.’\r\n\r\n    “Will any man, pretending to common honesty, thus basely\r\n    forfeit his Birthright, his most glorious privilege as an\r\n    Englishman, by a shameful perjury for the Lucre of a Bribe?\r\n    Can such a Bribe make him and his posterity happy in the midst\r\n    of his country’s ruin, and the just contempt and abhorrence of\r\n    all his neighbours? No, surely: but when the small wages of\r\n    his iniquity are spent, he must, like the Traitor Judas, hang\r\n    himself, or starve to death; because no man can either pity, or\r\n    deal with such a perjured abandoned wretch.\r\n\r\n    “Artful corruptors of the present times may flatter weak minds\r\n    with hopes of being admitted to vote without taking the Oath;\r\n    but it is a vain delusion; since the Law allows the _Candidates\r\n    or any two of the Electors_ to put the Oath to whomsoever they\r\n    please; and surely there are at least _Two Honest Men_ in every\r\n    Borough of the Kingdom, who will think it their duty to bring\r\n    Corruption to the Test of this just and necessary Oath, to the\r\n    eternal infamy of all Corruptors, and the Corrupted.”\r\n\r\nThe oath thus explicitly explained was in sober earnest administered\r\nby the lawyers retained in the respective interests, as illustrated\r\nby Hogarth in his “Polling Booth,” 1754. It is rather alarming to\r\nthink of the huge amount of perjury which has followed electioneering.\r\nThe general elections of the spring of 1741 were a trying ordeal for\r\nWalpole; all the well-worn clamours were revived, the “Convention” was\r\nonce more torn to shreds, and fresh attacks upon the “excise projects”\r\nwere turned to bitter political account. Amidst a shower of squibs,\r\nboth literary and pictorial, we find the caricature, “Dedicated to the\r\nworthy Electors of Great Britain,” of “The Devil upon Two Sticks,”\r\nin which Walpole, as the “Asmodeus” of the situation, is represented\r\nas being supported upon the shoulders of two of his bought-majority\r\nto ford the “Slough of Despond,” already crossed by some of his\r\nfollowers, who, though in safety on the bank, bear evident marks of\r\nthe dirty ordeal through which they have been compelled to struggle\r\nupon “Robin’s” account. Britannia and her patriotic friends(?) remain\r\nhigh and dry on the other shore; below the satire appears a pointed\r\nindication of the unpopular Walpolians, as “Members who voted for the\r\nExcise and against the Convention.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To the worthy Electors of Great Britain. Walpole carried\r\nthrough the “Slough of Despond.”\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL ON TWO STICKS. 1741.]\r\n\r\n“A Satire on Election Proceedings” was given to the public in\r\npictorial guise on the occasion of the appeal to the constituencies\r\nin May, 1741; the specific part of this squib was aimed at Walpole’s\r\nunpopular taxes and similar enactments, and the whole was dedicated\r\nto “Mayors and Corporations in general.” A dying elector--who, from\r\nthe evidence of a paper inscribed “£50,” and seen in his pocket, has\r\nsold himself to party--is in the hands of a ministerial candidate and\r\nthe personage of Evil; who are, between them, dragging the moribund\r\nand venal voter towards a precipice, “the Brink of Despotism, poverty,\r\nand destruction, inevitable if such courses are continued.” The\r\ncandidate or agent is apparently heedless of the precipice at his\r\nfeet; he is waving his hat in exultation, and shouting, “A vote,\r\na vote, a dead vote for us!” The devil, who is the deepest of the\r\nparty, is asserting with plausibility, “I’ll have the Majority, I\r\nwarrant you!” His pocket contains the measures which had destroyed\r\nWalpole’s popularity and at that time foreshadowed his fall--fancifully\r\nsupposed to have had their suggestion in the brain of the arch-fiend\r\nhimself: “Standing Army,” “Lotteries,” “Cyder” (tax), “Stamp Act,”\r\n“Bribes,” and “Address.” The demon is expelling “False reports\r\nagainst the City of London--all wind”--patriotism having at that era\r\nits head-quarters in the corporation; his hoof has trampled upon\r\nthe shield of Britannia, crushed down by “Press-warrants,” “Council\r\nof Satan,” and the ministerial policy--“Neglect the seamen till the\r\nmoment they are wanted, lest my beloved press-warrants should be\r\nforgot--my friends shall boldly call them lawful.” Walpole, whose\r\ntenure of office notoriously depended on the results of the elections\r\nin progress when this violent squib was launched, is further indicated\r\nin “The Foundation _we_ go upon;” “_we_” being by implication the\r\nprime minister and the devil; the foot of the latter rests upon these\r\n“Ways and means--Public Money, Promises, Titles, Contracts, Pensions,\r\nPreferments, Places--and by threatening to displace,” etc., besides\r\ncurrent coin for corruption. A further instance of Walpole’s disfavour\r\nis embodied in a paper concerning the army: “My Majority shall vote for\r\na numerous Land Force in time of Peace; to be established with a double\r\nproportion of officers!--the best proof of my influence:”--the source\r\nof that vaunted influence is shown in a bag of money, marked “Sinking\r\nFund,” from whence pours the stream of corruption--in the shape of\r\nbroad pieces--upon which the prime minister placed a reliance he did\r\nnot attempt to disguise, but, on the contrary, of which he cynically\r\nboasted.\r\n\r\nBeneath is a coat of arms, a favourite figure with the satirists, as\r\nif designed for the sign of a tavern; the bearings are, 1. A fox\r\nrunning away with a goose. 2. “Checquy,” _i.e._, as in the sign of the\r\nChequers; the words, “Time-servers Intire;” behind appear a bottle and\r\ntwo glasses, tobacco-pipes, and bribes. “£100, £50, £40, £2,”--to suit\r\nall appetites; on a riband above the shield is the legend:--“Votes are\r\nsold for Wine and Gold.” The crest of the card would be a suitable\r\nescutcheon for Hogarth’s comprehensive election satires which appeared\r\nin the contest of 1754.\r\n\r\nAnother coat of arms, also aimed at the credit of the prime minister,\r\nwas reissued as appropriate to this season:--“To the glory of the Rt.\r\nHonble. Sir Robert Walpole,” “A great Britt.,” alluding to the motto of\r\n“S(ir) R(obert) W(alpole)’s Arms,” supplies an ironical and explanatory\r\ntext:--\r\n\r\n    “There is another Device at the Base, the _Arch_, in the shape\r\n    of a _Coat of Arms_, which is bound round with a _Garter_,\r\n    and hath these words inscribed upon it:--_Honi soit qui Mal\r\n    y pense_; ‘Evil be to him, that evil thinks.’ What is most\r\n    remarkable in this _Coat_ is, that it bears _three axes_ on one\r\n    side, and that the crest is a _Man’s Head_, with a strange sort\r\n    of _Cap_, which hath a Ducal Coronet at the bottom by way of\r\n    Border;”\r\n\r\n--thus suggesting that Walpole deserved decapitation, while the ballads\r\nof the day were all for finding a gibbet for “false Bob.” As to the\r\nprint itself, it is said:--\r\n\r\n    “I am glad to hear that it hath already met with the\r\n    approbation and encouragement of a _very great Family_; and I\r\n    hope shortly to see it displayed in the richest colours upon\r\n    Fans, and wrought into _Screens_ and _Hangings_ for the use and\r\n    ornament of the Palace of Norfolk;”\r\n\r\n--referring to Houghton Hall, the seat of Sir Robert Walpole, a\r\nresidence well known to fame.\r\n\r\nThe popular interest excited by the Westminster contest generally\r\nseemed to make that election the most prominent in every appeal to\r\nthe country. On the dissolution of parliament, April 28, 1741, when\r\nthe fate of Walpole’s Administration was known to depend upon the\r\naggregate return of his nominees, the ministers expected to bring in\r\ntheir friends who had previously sat for Westminster; the first great\r\nopposition to the Government had its rise there, where the Court was\r\nsupposed to possess an unbounded influence. In the “Memoirs of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole” the circumstances of the contest are thus summarized:--\r\n\r\n    “The representatives in the last Parliament were Sir Charles\r\n    Wager, First Lord of the Admiralty; and Lord Sundon, a Lord\r\n    of the Treasury; and it was supposed they would have been\r\n    rechosen, as usual, without opposition. But Lord Sundon was\r\n    very unpopular; he had been raised from a low condition to\r\n    an Irish Peerage through the interest of his wife, who had\r\n    been favourite bed-chamber woman to Queen Catherine, wife\r\n    of George II. The other candidate, Sir Charles Wager, was\r\n    unexceptionable, both in his public and private character; but\r\n    his attachment to the Minister was a sufficient objection.\r\n    Some electors of Westminster proposed, very unexpectedly,\r\n    Admiral Vernon, then in the height of his popularity, and\r\n    Charles Edwin, a private gentleman of considerable fortune.\r\n    The opposition, at first despised, became formidable; and Sir\r\n    Charles Wager being summoned to convoy the King to Holland,\r\n    the management of the election was entrusted to ignorant\r\n    vestrymen and violent justices. The majority of the electors\r\n    were decidedly in favour of the Ministerial candidate; but Lord\r\n    Sundon was imprudently advised to close the poll, to order\r\n    a party of Guards to attend, and, while the military power\r\n    surrounded the hustings, the High Bailiff returned him and Sir\r\n    Charles Wager. This imprudent conduct highly exasperated the\r\n    populace, the Guards were insulted, Sundon was attacked, and\r\n    narrowly escaped with life. The example of the opposition at\r\n    Westminster diffused a general spirit throughout the kingdom,\r\n    and violent contests were excited in all quarters. Large\r\n    sums of money for supporting the expenses were subscribed by\r\n    Pulteney, the Duchess of Marlborough, and the Prince of Wales,\r\n    who contracted great debts on this memorable occasion, and\r\n    the managers of the opposition employed this money with great\r\n    advantage.”\r\n\r\nThis account, by W. Coxe, epitomizes the situation. George (Bubb)\r\nDodington was active on this occasion, directing the manœuvres of\r\nthe Leicester House faction, on behalf of the heir to the throne, in\r\nopposition to the ministers of his father, the king. Naturally the view\r\ntaken by Walpole’s biographer is favourable to that minister, who was\r\nat this time looked upon as the under-hand enemy of his country. He was\r\naccused of favouring Spain and France; and the taking of Porto Bello\r\nby Admiral Vernon, which was not, after all, a brilliant affair, but\r\nchiefly due to the cowardice of its defenders, was regarded as quite as\r\nmuch of a victory over the prime minister as over England’s foes. These\r\nsentiments characterize the spirit abroad on the Westminster contest of\r\n1741, which gave rise to many songs, broadsides, and pictorial satires\r\nuniformly unfavourable to the minister and his adherents.\r\n\r\nThe kind of influence or coercion brought to bear is described in an\r\n“Address to the Independent and Worthy Electors,” which was issued by\r\nthe “patriotic party,” May 5th:--\r\n\r\n    “Notwithstanding the extraordinary methods used by some of the\r\n    Burgesses of the Westminster Court, the select vestries of\r\n    several of the parishes, and the High Constable; who has in his\r\n    own name, and by his own power, taken upon him to summon the\r\n    inhabitants to give their Poll _against_ Admiral Vernon and Mr.\r\n    Edwin; we have been already so successful in our endeavours to\r\n    retrieve the _independency_ of this City and Liberty, in the\r\n    Election for the next Parliament, that the old members have but\r\n    a very inconsiderable majority (if any) of Good Votes against\r\n\r\n  The Glorious ADMIRAL VERNON,\r\n  And CHARLES EDWIN, Esq.,\r\n\r\n    who stand upon the Country Interest.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, Gentlemen, now is the time for completing what we\r\n    have so successfully begun; since it is certain that almost\r\n    the _whole_ of the Interest on the other side is already near\r\n    poll’d, and not one-fourth of ours. And considering the great\r\n    and perhaps decisive turn that the Election of this City and\r\n    Liberty may give to the Elections all over the kingdom, it is\r\n    hoped that no man who has a regard for the Liberties of his\r\n    Country, and the Independency of Parliament, will lie by or\r\n    remain neuter upon this occasion.\r\n\r\n    Therefore your Votes and Interest in favour of\r\n\r\n  ADMIRAL VERNON, and\r\n  CHARLES EDWIN, Esq.,\r\n\r\n    who have no other views than the good of their country and the\r\n    prosperity of this ancient City and Liberty.”\r\n\r\nThe contest thus stood: the king, Duke of Cumberland, and the\r\nministers,--with all their patronage, but overburdened with\r\nunpopularity, especially as regarded certain acts touching the navy,\r\nthe standing army, and excise and other new taxes disliked by\r\nmost,--supporting candidates looked upon with disfavour, on the one\r\nside; opposed by the Prince of Wales and his active friends of the\r\n“patriotic party,” with a popular naval commander and “a friend of his\r\ncountry” as candidates, and the voice of the multitude, on the other;\r\nthe arena being the hustings at Covent Garden, supposed to be regarded\r\nexpectantly by all the constituencies in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TO THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF WESTMINSTER. VERNON AND\r\nEDWIN. 1741.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 97._]\r\n\r\nA pictorial version of the scene of the Westminster Election, 1741,\r\ndedicated “to the brave Admiral Vernon and his worthy colleague,\r\nCharles Edwin, Esq.,” appeared with a copy of verses “To the\r\nIndependent and Worthy Electors of this Ancient City of Westminster.”\r\nThe candidates are exhibited before the front of Covent Garden Church;\r\nin the pediment is shown a dial, with the motto which at that time\r\ncaught the eye of the moving crowd, “So Passes Ye Glory of Ye World.”\r\nSeated at a table in the portico beneath, are the poll clerks, with\r\nthe returning officer casting up the votes: one clerk is directing a\r\nlist to be set down in the “Poll Book” for “Vernon and Edwin;” while\r\nthe representative of the other side says, “Few for my Lord.” Vernon’s\r\nships, and the benefit of increased commerce in the shape of bales of\r\nmerchandise, are shown in the distance; the favoured admiral himself,\r\nwith laced cocked hat and a staff in his right hand, is declaring,\r\n“For the Glory of Britain, down with the Spaniards.” In front of the\r\nplatform, and next the popular favourite, stands Charles Edwin, who\r\nis declaring his sentiments to be for “My King and my Country.” The\r\ncandidates of the opposition are received with enthusiasm: “Vernon\r\nfor ever, no dribbers here;” “Edwin at home, Vernon abroad,” is\r\nshouted by the persons to the left of the picture. The results of\r\nthe election were undetermined when this engraving appeared, so the\r\nengraver has anticipated the ultimate results of the petition, and\r\nmade the ministerial candidates unsuccessful. Sir Charles Wager,\r\nin a dejected state, is exclaiming, “I don’t know where to put up\r\nnext.” Lord Sundon, represented as a mere “fribble,” is in conference\r\nwith Justice De Veil, who had a large share in the control of the\r\nWestminster election, and being in the Government pay and a powerful\r\npartisan, was, together with the returning officer, on these accounts\r\nthe object of popular indignation. Lord Sundon is declaring for “The\r\nExcise and another place:” the duties on “cyder” and fermented liquors\r\ngave extreme offence to the multitude. The magistrate is made to\r\nexclaim, “I, Justice De Veil, say so, and will justify it.” The good\r\nfolks on the right are hissing, and crying, “No pensioners!” A female\r\nis pronouncing for the gallant admiral, “Vernon among the women to a\r\nman;” and a voter is denouncing “Spithead Lights,”--in reference to the\r\nreviews and home displays of the Admiralty, represented by Sir Charles\r\nWager.\r\n\r\nBelow the design are the lines--\r\n\r\n    “O, put it to the public voice\r\n    To make a free and worthy choice;\r\n    Excluding such as would in shame\r\n    The Commonwealth. Let whom we name\r\n    Have Wisdom, Foresight, Fortitude,\r\n    Be more with Faith than Place endu’d,\r\n    Whatever great one it offend;\r\n    And from the embraced Truth not bend.\r\n    These neither practised force, nor forms,\r\n    Nor did they leave the helm in storms;\r\n    These men were truly Magistrates;\r\n    And such they are make happy states.”\r\n\r\nTowards the close, the state of the poll stood thus:--\r\n\r\n  Sir Charles Wager, 3686.\r\n  Lord Sundon, 3533.\r\n  Admiral Vernon, 3290.\r\n  Charles Edwin, 3161.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the proceedings, when the independent candidates\r\nclaimed to have many votes in reserve, while the ministers had\r\nexhausted every subterfuge and all their resources, Lord Sundon very\r\ninjudiciously appealed to an armed intervention, forcibly closed the\r\npoll, and ordered a body of grenadiers to surround the hustings, and\r\nprevent any further voting; while the high bailiff countenanced\r\nthese high-handed illegalities, and made his return accordingly. This\r\nproceeding ruined the chances of the Government in this contest of\r\n1741: a petition was presented against the return of Wager and Sundon,\r\nand, although Walpole fought with all his influence, the subject\r\nwas made a party question; in the new session, a warm contest arose\r\nin the Commons, which reassembled June 25, 1741, and the return of\r\nthe sitting members was decided against by a majority of four, the\r\nnumbers told being 220 to 216. The circumstance of “the election\r\nbeing declared void,” is alluded to in a letter from Horace Walpole\r\nto Sir H. Mann, December 10, 1741: “Mr. Pulteney presented an immense\r\npiece of parchment, which he said he could but just lift; and was the\r\nWestminster Petition, and is to be heard next Tuesday, when we shall\r\nall have our brains knocked out by the mob.” A new election ensued;\r\nCharles Edwin and Lord Perceval were returned without opposition.\r\nVernon had been chosen for several places, and had already taken his\r\nseat for Ipswich. The admiral was regarded by the populace as a hero of\r\nthe first water, whose victories, though for the honour of his country,\r\nwere thorns in the side of the Administration, the members of which\r\nwere accused of taking bribes from the enemy. The bards compared Vernon\r\nto Cincinnatus:--\r\n\r\n    “Let Rome no more with ostentation show\r\n    Her so long-fam’d dictator from the plough;\r\n    Great Britain, rival of the Roman name,\r\n    In arts, in elegance, in martial fame,\r\n    Can, from the plough, her Cincinnatus fellow,\r\n    And show a Vernon storming Porto Bello.”\r\n\r\nThe admiral is further alluded to in another engraving produced upon\r\nthis same election--“The Funeral of Independency,” where the mourning\r\nprocession is passing a tavern with the loyal sign of the Crown and\r\nAnchor. Among other episodes is a man on a donkey, who is galloping\r\n“post to Ipswich 10_s._ 6_d._”--in allusion to Vernon’s return for\r\nthat place; while another man is apostrophizing the rider, “Thou art as\r\ntedious as the law.”\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the memorable Westminster election of 1741 is pictured\r\nin “The Triumph of Justice” (Dec. 1741), an engraving of a satirical\r\ncharacter, in which the late events, the triumph of opposition headed\r\nby the Prince of Wales, and the discomfiture of the Administration,\r\nare figured in allegorical guise. Walpole’s earthly career is assumed\r\nto be finished by the defeat in the Commons, who voted by a majority\r\nof four against the election of that minister’s placemen; and he is\r\nhurried to the tomb. A sarcophagus is displayed whereon a Satyr, with\r\nhour-glass and scythe, usurps the post of symbolical Time; on the base\r\nof the monument is inscribed “Hic Jacet;” in front is a medallion of\r\nthe statesmen supposed to be departed, with the legend:--“_Padera\r\nRobertas Ord: Perisci--tidis Eques_;” the supporting “weepers” are\r\nthe disqualified members,--they bear a band inscribed “Our Hopes are\r\ngone, the Election’s lost.” Sir Charles Wager, as representing the\r\nadmiralty, is leaning on a broken anchor. Lord Sundon has beside him a\r\ncoin, two keys, a loaf, some mice (one of which is caught in a trap),\r\nin allusion to the treasury “loaves and fishes,” parasites, etc. On\r\nthe ground, across the reverse of Walpole’s medallion, which bears the\r\nlegend “_Regit dictus Animos_,” are a sceptre and three bludgeons,\r\n“_Boroughs_” and “_Bruisers_,” both used for electioneering purposes,\r\nto which a plate marked “Covent Garden” further alludes.\r\n\r\nAbove the clouds, and surrounded by an angelic host, is seated the\r\nPrince of Wales, the _deus ex machina_ of Walpole’s defeat; his sceptre\r\nis a bludgeon, and he is pointing to an orator, who is presumably\r\ndenouncing “the king’s party,” whose power is broken. Beside the heir\r\napparent is a female divinity, balancing the scales of justice above\r\nthe figure of Edwin. At the prince’s feet is seen “the glorious 220,”\r\nthe number of votes recorded by the opposition, disqualifying Wager\r\nand Sundon, and in favour of a new election for Westminster. The\r\nBritish crown, decorated with palms and laurels, caps the design;\r\nwhich is inscribed, on a riband beneath, “_To the Independent Electors\r\nof Westminster_.” A further allegorical engraving, appropriately\r\ndue to Jo. Mynde, exhibits and commemorates the final stage in this\r\ncontest, where the Court was defeated and the opposition scored a\r\ncomplete triumph; this version, which consists of a design and a\r\npetition, engraved on the same plate, is entitled, “The Banner of\r\nLiberty, displayed in the Petition of the Inhabitants of Westminster,\r\nwith the Coat of Arms of the Glorious two hundred and twenty-two who\r\nvoted in favour of the Petitioners.” The emblematical design displays\r\nthe tutelary guardian of Westminster, a female figure, seated on the\r\nground in deep dejection; her hand is resting on the armorial shield\r\nof Charles Edwin, which is placed before that of Lord Perceval (Earl\r\nof Egmont); the arms of Westminster are engraved on a stone, and the\r\nshield of Admiral Vernon also appears. The goddess of Liberty has\r\narrived on the scene, she has summarily put “Slavery” to flight, and\r\nwhile she is assisting the guardian of the liberties of Westminster to\r\nrise, the muskets of the soldiery are trampled under foot, in allusion\r\nto the bold and impolitic step of ordering grenadiers to close the\r\npoll, resorted to at the previous election by Lord Sundon, to the\r\ndamage of his patron Walpole. In the Commons it was suggested to indict\r\nthe soldiers who had the temerity to interfere with “the rights of\r\nelection.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE INDEPENDENT WESTMINSTER ELECTORS’ TOAST.[42]\r\n\r\nIN MEMORY OF THE GLORIOUS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY.\r\n\r\n_To the Tune of ‘Come, let us prepare,’ etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n              “My _Westminster_ Friends,\r\n              Now we’ve gained our Ends,\r\n        Here’s a Health, and I’m sure ’twon’t repent ye:\r\n              With Gratitude think,\r\n              To the Health let us drink\r\n        Of the Glorious _Two hundred and Twenty_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n              “Come Honestly on,\r\n              Give your votes as you’ve done,\r\n        When you voted for EDWIN and VERNON;\r\n              Like Britons be bold,\r\n              Laugh at Power and Gold,\r\n        Else slavery comes, and will spare none.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n          “The army so grand,\r\n          For the good of the Land,\r\n    That is annually chose our protectors,\r\n          A new Trade have got,\r\n          And without _Scott or Lot_;\r\n    Are now all become our Electors.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n          “The Justices, too,\r\n          Will soon have their due,\r\n    As well as that Rogue the _High Bailey_;\r\n          Tho’ ye strut and look big,\r\n          With your Sword and Tye-wig,\r\n    The Parliament soon will to jail wi’ ye.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n          “Brave _Edwin_ for you\r\n          Did all he could do,\r\n    As at the last Poll ye remember,\r\n          Now all of ye shou’d\r\n          To him be as good,\r\n    And choose him once more for your member.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n          “An _honest good_ Lord\r\n          To find out, how hard,\r\n    At this time, let any man think, Sir!\r\n          Yet all do agree\r\n          Lord Perceval’s he,\r\n    Then EDWIN and PERCEVAL drink, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n          “Besides his brave spirit,\r\n          My Lord has this merit\r\n    With us;

one or two\r\nverses only are selected:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE INDEPENDENT WESTMINSTER CHOICE, OR, PERCEVAL AND EDWIN.\r\n\r\n_To the Tune of ‘The Free Masons.’_\r\n\r\n    “Ye Westminster Boys, unite and rejoice,\r\n      Be steady, and make no defection;\r\n    For if you stand true, you are not too few\r\n      To carry your glorious election.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “Thus, while Vernon shall ride on America’s tide,\r\n      And by arms bring the Spanish Dons under;\r\n    His friend shall stand here, this noble young Peer,\r\n      And rattle old Bob with his thunder.\r\n\r\n    “You may now firmly hope, your ruin to stop,\r\n      When Vernon abroad guards the nation:\r\n    And this noblemen true, match’d by none or by few,\r\n      Shall expose all Court Tricks and Evasion.\r\n\r\n    “Thus shall PERCEVAL brave, your Liberties save,\r\n      And with EDWIN in Senate defend you:\r\n    These men they were giv’n, a present from Heav’n,\r\n      Reject not what Heaven does send you.”\r\n\r\nAnother spirited ballad, on the same theme, and also to the tune of\r\n“_Come, let us prepare_,” appeared as “A New Song,” with a woodcut\r\nheading of a maiden and matron drinking tea at the sign of the Crown\r\nand Orange-Tree. A second version of the same ballad was published as:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE TRUE ENGLISH-BOYS’ SONG TO VERNON’S GLORY.\r\n\r\nOCCASIONED BY THE BIRTHDAY OF THAT BRAVE ADMIRAL.\r\n\r\n_To be sung round the Bonfires of London and Westminster._\r\n\r\n    “Ye Westminster Boys, All sing and rejoice,\r\n      Your friends in the House will not fail ye,\r\n    We’ll the soldiers indict, And set matters right,\r\n      In spite of that Rogue the High Bailey.\r\n\r\n    “Let us raise our Bonfires As high as the spires,\r\n      And ring ev’ry Bell in the Steeple;\r\n    All the Art we defy, Of the whole Ministry,\r\n      To run VERNON down with the people.\r\n\r\n    “Stand round, and appear, All ye Hearts of Oak here,\r\n      And set the proud _Don_ at defiance,\r\n    To VERNON let’s drink, who made Spain and France slink,\r\n      And BOB, who’s with both in Alliance.\r\n\r\n    “A true lad won’t flinch, Now we’re at this sad pinch,\r\n      But old England, on VERNON rely on,\r\n    For this honest Fellow, who took _Porto Bello_,\r\n      Shall find BOB a Gibbet to die on.\r\n\r\n    “Stop not VERNON’S career, Thro’ Folly and Fear,\r\n      Lest the _French_, or the _Spaniards_ should beat ye;\r\n    Nor let _Don Geraldino_, Busy _Horace_, or _Keen_ O\r\n      Bamboozle you with a new Treaty.\r\n\r\n    “This time then be bold, Be not bought and sold,\r\n      Nor let _Monsieur’s_ old Tricks still seduce ye,\r\n    Like our Forefathers try, Or to conquer or die,\r\n      Ere _France_ to a province reduce ye.\r\n\r\n    “_Hessian_ Troops are all sham, The Neutrality damn,\r\n      The _Convention_, and ev’ry Vagary;\r\n    The money they’ve got, All is now gone to pot,\r\n      And so is the Queen of Hungary.\r\n\r\n    “But send Ships and Food, TO VERNON, that’s good,\r\n      For unless Heaven feed him with _Manna_,\r\n    His designs they’ll defeat, For without men and meat,\r\n      How can he e’er take the _Havanna_.\r\n\r\n    “Besides, let us send, a true militant Friend,\r\n      Nor longer be Bob’s, or Spain’s dupe a;\r\n    They there would agree,--Both by Land and by Sea,\r\n      And soon be the masters of Cuba.”\r\n\r\nThe managers of what was called the “Country party” consisted of those\r\nwho entitled themselves “patriots,” and were active in promoting the\r\n“good cause.” The victory which in 1741 unseated Wager and Sundon,\r\nand moreover inflicted so heavy a blow upon Walpole’s influence that\r\nhe lost his corrupt majority, and subsequently retired from the\r\nstruggle, was annually commemorated by an association of members of\r\nthe constituency which had been the first to assert its independence.\r\nAn invitation was issued to the voters to meet together to celebrate\r\nthis anniversary; a copperplate, neatly engraved, surmounted by an\r\nallegorical design, and surrounded by an elegant frame or border,\r\nformed the ticket:--\r\n\r\n  “The Independent Electors of Westminster\r\n  Are desired to meet at Vintners’ Hall, Thames Street,\r\n  On Friday, the 15 Feb. 1744,\r\n\r\n    At 3 o’clock, to Dine together, in order to Commemorate their\r\n    Success on the 22nd of December, 1741, and further to promote\r\n    the same Public Spirit.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE DODINGTON, Esq. }          { LORD GEORGE GRAHAM.\r\n  CHARLES EDWIN, Esq.    } Stewards { GEORGE GRENVILLE, Esq.\r\n  THOMAS GORE, Esq.      }          { SIR JOHN PHILLIPS, Bart.\r\n\r\n  Pray Pay the Bearer 5 shil^s.”\r\n\r\nThe design which heads this dinner-ticket represents Hercules and\r\nBritannia driving away the Harpies presumed to have been preying upon\r\ncorruption; the Goddess of Liberty, with the British lion by her side,\r\nis trampling on prostrate venality,--two figures, with bags of money\r\nand a heap of gold, cast down ignominiously.\r\n\r\n“The Body of Independent Electors of Westminster” was evidently\r\nconstituted into a society, at first exclusively for the furtherance\r\nof patriotic views, but, as the Court party alleged in 1745, to spread\r\nJacobite sentiments. The excitement evoked by the rising of the\r\nScottish clans and proclamation of the Young Pretender in 1745 was\r\nstill at its height; the gaols were filled with Scotch rebels, and\r\nthe famous trial of Lord Lovat, which only commenced on the 9th of\r\nMarch, was absorbing popular attention to the extinction of everything\r\nbut Jacobite plots, both real and feigned. As the patriotic party\r\nhad long been in antagonism with the Court, whose ministers had been\r\ndefeated through this influence, and the dissolution of Parliament was\r\nimpending, those in office neglected no opportunity of bringing the\r\nso-called “friends of the people” into evil repute. On the assumption\r\nthat all weapons are lawful in electioneering warfare, much political\r\ncapital was manufactured out of the Pretender’s _fiasco_; and the\r\nScottish Rebellion was seized as an opportunity to stigmatize all\r\npersons of integrity, and those who were declared enemies of the\r\ncorrupt Administration then in power, as Jacobites and sympathizers\r\nwith the rebels.\r\n\r\n“The Independent Electors of the City and Liberty of Westminster” held\r\ntheir anniversary festival at Vintners’ Hall, on the 19th of March,\r\n1747. The Stewards were the Earl of Lichfield, Earl of Orrery, Viscount\r\nAndover, Sir R. Bamfylde, George Heathcote, and Thomas Carew. On this\r\noccasion the stewards for the ensuing year were chosen; they were Lord\r\nWard, Lord Windsor, Sir James Dashwood, Sir Charles Tynte, Sir Thomas\r\nClarges, and George Cooke (who was then canvassing Middlesex). On the\r\nconclusion of the business of the afternoon, and after the festivities,\r\ntoasts, as was customary, began to be proposed. _The London Evening\r\nPost_ gives a list of these healths, beginning with “The King;” but,\r\nas an implication of Jacobite proclivities, it is added in another\r\npaper that the royal health was honoured in the recognized Jacobite\r\nfashion--to “Charley over the Water:”--“Each man having a glass\r\nof water on the left hand, and waving the glass of wine over the\r\nwater,”--but this accusation was probably a bold electioneering _ruse_.\r\nThe succeeding toasts were as follows:--“The Prince;” “The Duke;”\r\n“Prosperity to the independent electors of Westminster;” “Prosperity to\r\nthe city of London and the trade thereof;” “Thanks to the Worshipful\r\nCompany of Vintners’ for the use of their Hall;” “The Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon;” “Success to the arms of Great Britain by sea and land;” “To\r\nthe annexing _Cape Breton_ to the Crown of _Great Britain_;” “That the\r\nspirit of independency may diffuse itself through the nation;” “That\r\nthe enemies of _Great Britain_ may never eat the bread nor drink the\r\ndrink thereof;” “That the Naturalization Bill may be kicked out of the\r\nHouse, and the foreigners out of the kingdom;” “That the darkening our\r\nwindows may enlighten our understanding” (tax upon light); “To all\r\nthose that dare--be honest;” “The stewards elect;” “The late stewards,\r\nwith thanks for the trouble they have taken;” “Our old Friend ----.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, “amidst this mirth, one Mr.\r\nWilliams, Master of the ‘White Horse’ in Piccadilly, being observed to\r\nmake memorandums with a pencil, gave such offence that he was severely\r\ncuffed and kicked out of the company.” It appears that a Jacobite\r\ncomplexion was given to the rather forcible expression of public\r\ncontempt bestowed upon the Ministerial notetaker, who was branded as\r\n“the Spy.” A spirited version of this incident, executed closely in\r\nthe manner of Hogarth, if not by that master, to whose portrait of\r\nLord Lovat it in style approximates (the artist was himself one of the\r\nfree electors of Westminster), exhibits the ignominious ejectment of\r\n“the Spy,” whose detection is further indicated by the paper he has\r\ndropped on the ground, marked “List of the persons, etc.” The pictorial\r\nview of an episode to which undue importance was attached, owing to the\r\nexcited relation of parties at the time, is accompanied by a quotation\r\nfrom “Hudibras” appropriate to the subject:--\r\n\r\n    “Honour in the Breech is lodg’d\r\n    As wise philosophers have judged;\r\n    Because a kick in that part more\r\n    Hurts Honour than deep wounds before.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF\r\nWESTMINSTER: THE SPY DETECTED. MARCH, 1747.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 109._]\r\n\r\nA few days later a second entry shows that it was seriously entertained\r\nat that emergency to carry the matter farther; in any case--although\r\nthey do not seem to have eventually made anything of it--the complaint\r\nwas taken up by the Commons, and referred to the managers of Lord\r\nLovat’s trial, then just concluded. On the 24th of March--\r\n\r\n    “Complaint being made to the House that John Williams,\r\n    keeper of the ‘White Horse Inn’ in Piccadilly, was on\r\n    Thursday last, in a public assembly, assaulted and severely\r\n    treated, upon a public assertion made by some persons in\r\n    that assembly--‘_that_, Fraser, _said by them, to be one of\r\n    the principal witnesses against the Lord Lovat, was in his\r\n    custody_’ ORDER’D. That a committee be appointed to\r\n    enquire into the matter of this complaint, and examine persons\r\n    in the most solemn manner; that this committee be the managers\r\n    against Lord Lovat.”\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is obscured by party misrepresentations. One\r\nJames Fraser, who was pronounced a Jacobite, was active against\r\nthe Ministerial candidates at the Westminster contest of 1749,\r\nwhere all opponents of the Court were denounced as Jacobites, while\r\nthe “patriots,” “country party,” and “independent electors of\r\nWestminster,”--as they indiscriminately christened themselves--retorted\r\nupon Earl Gower, through his son, Lord Trentham, the Ministerial\r\ncandidate for that city, the accusation of Jacobite leanings:--“_Ask_\r\nLord Trentham _who had his foot in the stirrup_ in the year 1715.”\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary dissolution followed in June, 1747, when the\r\nfavourite manœuvre of those in power was to recklessly accuse their\r\nopponents of belonging to the Stuart faction. The odium attaching to\r\nthe suspicion of Jacobite tendencies was sufficiently strong to place\r\nthe “Independent party” in a smaller minority than at the previous\r\nelection, and thus the outbreak in favour of the Pretender served to\r\nrecruit the strength of the Court party, which had been jeopardized at\r\nthe 1741 election, and had shown signs of declension before the rising\r\nin 1745. The Government candidates for Westminster, Admiral Sir Peter\r\nWarren and Lord Trentham, were again chosen from the Admiralty. Lord\r\nTrentham was the son of that Earl Gower who was for some time the head\r\nof the Opposition, and at this juncture was one of the recent recruits\r\nof the Court party.\r\n\r\n    “See Gower, who the Court had opposed thick and thin;\r\n      Was out, then was in, then was out and now in;\r\n    He kiss’d hands, then look’d pensive--as much as to say,\r\n      “I can’t judge which is best, to go or to stay.\r\n                                          Derry Down.”\r\n\r\n  (_Place Book for the Year 1745._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTMINSTER--THE TWO-SHILLING BUTCHER. 1747.]\r\n\r\nLord Trentham’s selection as a lord of the admiralty occurred somewhat\r\nlater (1749). The second candidate was Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who,\r\nas usual, was supported by a mob of Jack Tars, or of ruffians dressed\r\nin sailors’ clothes for the occasion, a common party subterfuge at the\r\nWestminster elections. The candidates put forward for the suffrages\r\nof the “Independent Electors,” and who came out of the contest\r\ningloriously, were, as first announced, Sir Thomas Clarges (one of the\r\nstewards of the association) and Sir John Phillips (who was a steward\r\nin 1744); after a ten-days’ canvass the latter declined to proceed in\r\nhis candidature, on the plea of ill health, and Sir Thomas Dyke was put\r\nup in his stead. Early in the contest a well-executed caricature, in\r\nthe manner of Boitard or Gravelot, both artists being contemporary with\r\nHogarth, was offered to the public under the title of “The Two-Shilling\r\nButcher.” It was at this election that the highest personages\r\ncanvassed. The Duke of Cumberland and the Prince of Wales appeared\r\nin support of the rival factions. In the pictorial view of this\r\nsituation, Lord Trentham, a dandified person dressed in the extreme\r\nof French taste, is in conference with his “backer” the “Two-Shilling\r\nButcher,” who has been supposed by Thomas Wright and other authorities\r\nto represent the “Culloden Butcher,” _i.e._ the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nMr. F. G. Stephens, who has described all the early caricatures in\r\nthe Hawkins Collections with the utmost pains and minutiæ, sets down\r\nthis personage as Mr. Butcher, the agent to the Duke of Bedford,\r\nwhose residence is introduced in the rear. However, the figure in the\r\npresent version corresponds with similar representations of the stout\r\nCumberland Butcher; moreover, an allusion to cattle put into the mouth\r\nof this personage strongly indicates, by analogy with other caricatures\r\non “horned cattle,” that none other than the duke is meant. The results\r\nof the election were at this time uncertain. The affected lordling,\r\nalso satirized as Sir Silkington, is drawling, “Curs me! you’d buy\r\nme, ye Brutes, at 2_s._ p. Head _Bona fide_?” to which the figure\r\ntravestied as a butcher, with apron, knife, and steel, is responding,\r\n“My Lord, there being a Fatality in ye Cattle, that there is 3000\r\nabove my Cut, tho’ I offered handsome.” The “3000” presumably refers\r\nto the Association of Independent Electors, who, at the previous poll\r\n(1741), registered for the “patriot” candidates (Vernon and Edwin), but\r\nwere found wanting in 1747, as the figures at the close of the poll\r\ndemonstrated. The Duke of Bedford’s residence is introduced to recall\r\nthe circumstance that he and the candidate were close matrimonial\r\nconnections, the duke having married the eldest daughter of John,\r\nEarl Gower. In front of this building, with the “bustos” of sphinxes\r\nabove the posts of the gateway, is another important personage, who\r\nis bribing rival canvassers with gold openly filched from the pockets\r\nof Britannia, who is highly indignant at the proceeding; she is made\r\nto exclaim, with reason, “Ye Gods, what pickpockets!” The people seen\r\nin the dark transaction of being bribed were defectors from “Phillips\r\nand Clarges,” demoralized by the spell of gold; another voter is\r\nhastening away, denouncing the venality of these persons. One of the\r\nsphinxes is exclaiming--“We can’t decoy them in!” while labels, carried\r\nthrough the air by pigeons, record “The Independent has it,” and “For\r\nYorkshire.” On the opposite side is shown the front of St. Paul’s,\r\nCovent Garden, with its dial and the motto “So passes ye glory of ye\r\nworld.” Before its portals stand the rival candidates, Sir Thomas\r\nClarges and Sir Thomas Dyke; they are showing their contempt for mere\r\n“placemen representatives” by trampling upon government bribes: “Places\r\nin Exchequer we tread on,” and “No lucrative Employment.” Near them\r\nare the poll clerks, and the returning officer, with the poll-book\r\nunder his charge. Beside the “independent” candidates are shown their\r\nsupporters: one of these, bearing in his hand the cap of liberty, is\r\npressing the latter on the acceptance of the electors, and assuring\r\nthem, “Those candidates will serve you!” while a scroll, borne above\r\nthe heads of the voters, carries the warning, “No Trentham!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUMOURS OF THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION; OR, THE SCALD\r\nMISERABLE INDEPENDENT ELECTORS IN THE SUDS. 1747.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 113._]\r\n\r\nOther caricatures appeared on the same subject, which excited, as\r\nusual, the largest share of public interest during the elections\r\nthroughout the country. One of these first appeared, in compliment\r\nto the Scottish Rebellion, the latest novelty of the time, as “The\r\nJaco-Independo-Rebello-Plaido.” In this version the business of the\r\nelection is represented to take place before Westminster Hall, as a\r\nfurther allusion to the Jacobites and Lord Lovat’s trial there. The two\r\nparties and their respective head-quarters, established at taverns,\r\nare represented, and above all hovers the power of Destruction, always\r\npictured as an important agent of “the other side,” according to the\r\nrespective allegations of the contending parties. The Devil, in the\r\npresent instance, is made “to take care of his own,” and has a stock of\r\nhalters and axes for the rebels. “I have the Fee in my hands,” saith\r\nthe Evil One. One side is appropriated to Ministerialists at the sign\r\nof Jolly Bacchus and the (Rabbit) Warren. Two persons are leaning from\r\nthe first-floor window, and exhorting those with votes to “Give the\r\nDevil his due”--_i.e._ the Jacobites. The most prominent figure is a\r\nbutcher; and no doubt, according to Mr. F. G. Stephens’s suggestion,\r\nthe person thus implied is Mr. Butcher, the Duke of Bedford’s agent,\r\nand a less distinguished person than the “Cumberland Duke” pictured in\r\nthe “Two-Shilling Butcher.” He is waving a scroll endorsed, “Trentham\r\nand Warren.” The butcher agent is surrounded by partisans; Admiral Sir\r\nPeter Warren’s sailors (a Lascar among them) are asserting “bludgeon\r\nlaw;” the people are pushing to the Governmental head-quarters, crying\r\n“No independency” and “No Pretender,” as if the terms were synonymous;\r\na Frenchman may be identified in the crowd; and a person is offering\r\nthe butcher a paper, “They squeak.” The head-quarters of the opposite\r\nparty is shown as a Jacobite house. The flag displayed is adorned with\r\nthe figure of an owl dressed in a full wig and a counsellor’s bands,\r\nand indicates “Morgan’s Ghost,” the Morgan thus favoured having been\r\na Jacobite barrister who had the misfortune to be implicated in the\r\nabortive rising of 1745 in the interests of the Pretender, which cost\r\nMorgan his life. The adherents rallying round this questionable house,\r\nintended as a reflection upon the Association of Independent Electors\r\nof Westminster, who were stigmatized as friends of the Jacobites,\r\nare dressed for the most part in plaids, and wear Scotch bonnets, to\r\nimply their Jacobite sympathies. This caricature was republished,\r\nwith the hustings at Covent Garden substituted for Westminster Hall,\r\nand the Devil very civilly giving place to the figure of an angel,\r\nwith the legend “Faithful to King and country.” The title was changed\r\nto “The Humours of the Westminster Election; or, the Scald Miserable\r\nIndependent Electors in the Suds,” 1747, with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    “Britons brave are true and unconfin’d,\r\n    To lash the Coxcombs of the Age design’d;\r\n    Fixt to no Party, censure all alike,\r\n    And the distinguish’d Villain sure to strike;\r\n    Pleas’d we behold the great maintain the Cause,\r\n    And Court and Country join the loud applause.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT BRITAIN’S UNION; OR, THE LITCHFIELD RACES. 1747.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 114._]\r\n\r\nStrong Jacobite imputations are farther conveyed in the pictorial\r\nversion of “Great Britain’s Union; or, the Litchfield Races, 1747.”\r\nBoth Whig and Tory parties, not content with the legitimate and\r\nrecognized contests of the hustings, and their ultimate goal, the\r\nsenate, carried their partisan proclivities on to the racecourse, and\r\nministerial and opposition stakes were alternately put into competition\r\non the same turf. Thus, at Lichfield were held Tory race weeks,\r\nsucceeded by similar gatherings on the part of their opponents. Some\r\nrather extraordinary doings occurred there, the general description\r\nof which is conveyed by the caricature; the two factions by some\r\nmeans came into collision, and his Grace of Bedford received a sound\r\nhiding with a horsewhip as an acknowledgment of his services to the\r\nHouse of Hanover and his antagonism to the Patriotic party, denounced\r\nas Jacobites by their Hanoverian rivals; Earl Gower, and his modish\r\nson, Lord Trentham, were also roughly handled. Various freaks of\r\nan extravagant nature were performed, ladies and gentlemen of the\r\nPatriotic faction appearing dressed in Scottish plaids. In the design\r\nthis circumstance is specially embodied: a party of enthusiasts,\r\nassembled in a booth on the course, are toasting the Pretender, whose\r\nsun is seen in the distance, falsely depicted as in the ascendant.\r\nA despondent grenadier outside the Jacobite head-quarters, is\r\ngrumbling, “We are rode by Germans;” a cradle, a Gallic cock, and a\r\n_fleur-de-lis_ allude to the Chevalier and the French assistance lent\r\nto his pretensions; overhead several hands are seen clasped, with the\r\nsuggestive legend, “A-greed.” A Frenchified person, pointing to a\r\ngamecock fighting his own shadow, is denouncing the Duke (of Bedford)\r\nin no measured terms; under his right arm is the whip with which the\r\nduke was castigated, and in the left hand of this valorous bravo is\r\na paper, “We have courage.” As usual, the Devil is present, and this\r\ntime he is flying off with “Information,” possibly to be laid before\r\nhis dear friends in office. A sort of zany, seated beneath a flag\r\nmarked, “And curse upon denial” (alluding to equivocation on the part\r\nof several), is giving the starting signal. The Scotch plaid-clad\r\njockey riding for the Chevalier is beating the Hanoverian jockey on the\r\ntraditional “White Horse.” This highly fanciful conception, the reverse\r\nof actual experience, is hailed with extravagant delight by the excited\r\nassembly; the occupants of the Grand Stand are described as “Don Juan\r\nand his friends at the place of Desert.” Various ballads and satirical\r\nproductions were evoked upon the transaction related.\r\n\r\nLord Trentham, his father, Earl Gower, and their great relative, the\r\nDuke of Bedford, are, with various references to the late election\r\nfor Westminster, introduced into several caricatures which followed,\r\nand notably in “Great Britain’s Union; or, Litchfield Races\r\ntransposed,” “A Sight of the Banging Bout at Litchfield,” and “An Exact\r\nRepresentation” of the same occurrence. The circumstances to which\r\nthese pictorial satires refer are traceable to the national ferment\r\nsucceeding the suppression of the Rebellion, when, as recapitulated,\r\nvarious eccentricities were committed by those who favoured the\r\nPretender’s cause; among others, certain Staffordshire sportsmen\r\nmade themselves conspicuous. Smollett, in his “History of England,”\r\ndescribes these vagaries: the Stuart partisans--\r\n\r\n    “appeared in the Highland taste of variegated drapery, and,\r\n    their zeal descending to a very extraordinary exhibition of\r\n    practical ridicule, they hunted with hounds clothed in plaid, a\r\n    fox dressed in red uniform. Even the females at their assembly\r\n    and the gentlemen at the races affected to wear the chequered\r\n    stuff by which the prince-pretender and his followers had been\r\n    distinguished. Divers noblemen on the course were insulted\r\n    as apostates; and one personage of high rank is said to have\r\n    undergone a very disagreeable flagellation.”\r\n\r\nThe sequel of this adventure is related in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_\r\n(1748):--\r\n\r\n    “Before Mr. Justice Burnett, took place the trial of the\r\n    information against Toll (a dancing-master) and others,\r\n    for insulting and striking the Duke of Bedford, and other\r\n    gentlemen, upon Whittington Heath, at the late Litchfield\r\n    horse-races; when it was likewise proposed by the counsel for\r\n    the defendants, that the several rioters, to the number of\r\n    thirteen, should submit to be found guilty: if the counsel for\r\n    the crown would consent to withdraw the information against\r\n    several other persons concerned in that riot.”\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the _fracas_ are also alluded to in the “Letters\r\nof Junius” (xxii.):--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Heston Humphrey, a country attorney, horsewhipped the duke\r\n    with equal justice, severity, and perseverance on the course at\r\n    Litchfield. Rigby and Lord Trentham were also cudgelled in a\r\n    most exemplary manner.”\r\n\r\nThese incidents gave rise to various ballads as well as caricatures; a\r\nparody on “Chevy Chase” offers the liveliest version of the affair:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE LORDS’ LAMENTATION; OR, THE WHITTINGTON DEFEAT.\r\n\r\n    “God prosper long our noble King,\r\n      Our lives and safeties all,\r\n    A woeful Horse race late there did\r\n      At Whittington befall.\r\n    Great Bedford’s duke, a mighty prince\r\n      A solemn vow did make;\r\n    His pleasure in fair Staffordshire\r\n      Three summer days to take,\r\n    At once to grace his father’s race,\r\n      And to confound his foes;\r\n    But ah! (with grief my muse does speak)\r\n      A luckless time he chose.\r\n    For some rude clowns who long had felt\r\n      The weight of tax and levy,\r\n    Explain’d their case unto his Grace,\r\n      By arguments full heavy.\r\n    ‘No Gow’r,’ they cried, ‘no tool of pow’r!’\r\n      At that the Earl turned pale.\r\n    ‘No Gow’r, no Gow’r, no tool of pow’r!’\r\n      Re-echo’d from each dale.\r\n    Then Bedford’s mighty breast took fire;\r\n      Who thus enrag’d did cry,\r\n    ‘To horse, my Lords, my knights and squires;\r\n      We’ll be reveng’d or die.’\r\n    They mounted straight, all men of birth,\r\n      Captains of land and sea;\r\n    No prince or potentate on earth\r\n      Had such a troop as he.\r\n    Great Lords and Lordlings, close conjoin’d,\r\n      A shining squadron stood;\r\n    But to their cost, the Yeomen Host\r\n      Did prove the better blood.\r\n    ‘A Gow’r, a Gow’r! ye son o’ th’ w--e,\r\n      Vile spawn of Babylon!’\r\n    This said, his Grace did mend his pace,\r\n      And came full fiercely on.\r\n    Three times he smote a sturdy foe;\r\n      Who undismay’d replied,\r\n    ‘Or be thou devil, or be thou Duke,\r\n      Thy courage shall be tried.’\r\n    The charge began; but, on one side,\r\n      Some slackness there was found;\r\n    The smart cockade in dust was laid,\r\n      And trampled on the ground.\r\n    Some felt sore thwacks upon their backs.\r\n      Some, pains within their bowels;\r\n    And who did joke the royal oak,\r\n      Were well rubbed with its towels.\r\n    Then terror seized the plumed troop,\r\n      Who turned themselves to flight.\r\n    Foul rout and fear brought up the rear,\r\n      Oh! ’twas a piteous sight!\r\n    Each warrior urg’d his nimble steed,\r\n      But none durst look behind;\r\n    Th’ insulting foe, they well did know,\r\n      Had got them in the wind.\r\n    Who ne’er lost scent, until they came\r\n      Unto the gallows tree:\r\n    ‘Now,’ said their foes, ‘we’ll not oppose,\r\n      Your certain destiny.\r\n    No further help of ours ye lack,\r\n      Grant mercy with your doom!\r\n    Trust to the care o’ the three-legg’d mare,\r\n      She’ll bring ye all safe home.’\r\n    Then wheel’d about with this fierce shout,\r\n      ‘Confusion to the Rump!’\r\n    Leaving each knight to moan his plight\r\n      Beneath the triple stump.\r\n    Now Heaven preserve such hearts as these\r\n      From secret Treachery!\r\n    Who hate a knave, and scorn a slave,\r\n      May such be ever _Free_!”\r\n\r\nIn 1749, Lord Trentham, having been appointed one of the lords of the\r\nadmiralty, had to vacate his seat, and every exertion was made by the\r\nOpposition to hinder his re-election.\r\n\r\n    “With this view they held consultations, agreed to resolutions,\r\n    and set up a private gentleman named Sir George Vandeput as\r\n    the competitor of Lord Trentham, declaring that they would\r\n    support his pretensions at their own expense; being the more\r\n    encouraged to this enterprise by the countenance and assistance\r\n    of the Prince of Wales and his adherents. They accordingly\r\n    opened houses of entertainment for their partisans, solicited\r\n    votes, circulated remonstrances, and propagated abuse; in a\r\n    word, they canvassed with surprising spirit and perseverance\r\n    against the whole interest of St. James’s. Mobs were hired,\r\n    and processions made on both sides, and the city of Westminster\r\n    was filled with tumult and uproar.”\r\n\r\n    “Ye ELECTORS who hate all the French strolling Clan,\r\n    If you love yourselves, chase not the MINISTER’S MAN,\r\n    But give all your Votes to the _Man_ of the KING,\r\n    SIR GEORGE VANDEPUT’S he--and GEORGE we will sing.”\r\n\r\nThis election occurred in the midst of a violent popular anti-Gallican\r\nfeeling, which had been shown particularly against a company of French\r\nplayers who were performing at the Haymarket, and who were spoken of by\r\nthe mob as the “French vagrants.” An attempt had been made to hinder\r\nthem from acting, and they had been protected only by a mob hired by\r\nLord Trentham, who appears to have affected Gallic manners, and to\r\nhave been vain of his proficiency in the French language. The night\r\nafter his ministerial appointment there was a great riot at the French\r\ntheatre, in which Lord Trentham was accused of being personally active,\r\nalthough he denied it to the electors. This was made the most of by his\r\nopponents, who stigmatized him in ballads and squibs as “the champion\r\nof the French _strollers_;” and common people said that learning to\r\ntalk French was only a step towards the introduction of French tyranny.\r\n\r\nAn “Elector” writes, by way of warning to others:--\r\n\r\n    “Being the other evening at the French Theatre, who should\r\n    I see at the head of a mob of foreign varlets, cooks,\r\n    etc., signalizing himself in a laudable attack upon his\r\n    fellow-citizens, but this very young man, whom they had\r\n    so lately made choice of as the defender of their rights\r\n    and privileges. I was indeed amazed to see, at so critical\r\n    a juncture, that sword, which had hitherto kept peaceful\r\n    possession of its scabbard, brandished over the heads and\r\n    planted at the hearts of several of his own electors, and that\r\n    in support of a parcel of foreign vagabonds, who, from being a\r\n    nuisance in their own nation, are now come to be the disgrace\r\n    of ours. Certain I am this fit of Gallic valour could never be\r\n    communicated by the touch of that Royal British hand he had\r\n    but that very morning kissed for his employment. Perhaps an\r\n    impatient desire to prove himself qualified for the warlike\r\n    Board to which he was appointed might induce him to seize the\r\n    first opportunity of displaying his prowess; being willing to\r\n    convince the public, that how deficient soever the sea may\r\n    have been, the land is, at least, able to produce a fighting\r\n    Admiral. However, I cannot help concluding him a very unfit\r\n    person to defend me _against_ the French in one House, who is\r\n    ready to cut my throat _for_ them in another.”\r\n\r\nA flight of satirical ballads appeared upon these events. The best of\r\nthese compositions, which were remarkable for point and spirit, was\r\nentitled:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“PEG TRIM TRAM IN THE SUDS; OR, NO FRENCH STROLLERS.\r\n\r\n    “I sing you a song of a right noble Lord,\r\n    Whose name must, for ever, stand FOOL on Record;\r\n    Who, losing a _Seat_, by accepting a Place,\r\n    SUBSCRIB’D to _French Strollers_, so fell in disgrace.\r\n\r\n    “This right noble Lord, when elected before,\r\n    To preserve us, in our _ev’ry Privilege_ swore;\r\n    How well he maintain’d them will quickly appear,\r\n    Deduc’d from right Reason, unaided by Sneer.\r\n\r\n    “Got snug in the House, he exerted his zeal,\r\n    Not for his Constituents, or the Common-Weal;\r\n    But to serve his own ends, and aid _Gentleman_ HARRY,[43]\r\n    Lest his Glorious Views, for our Good, should miscarry.\r\n\r\n    “Have you heard a pert _Parrot_ cry ‘_Quaker-a-quer;\r\n    A cup of Good Sack; Pretty Poll; Saucy Cur_’?\r\n    You’ve then heard this Lord to great HARRY reply,\r\n    And echo, _Yes, No,--No, Yes_;” anything cry.\r\n\r\n    “Have you seen a young _Puppy_ leap over a stick,\r\n    Fetch, carry, yelp, fawn, and learn every fond Trick?\r\n    Then you’ve seen this sleek Lordling on HARRY attend,\r\n    And, aw’d by his nod, most obsequiously bend.\r\n\r\n    “To reward such bright parts and so ductile a mind\r\n    The Dispenser of PLACES was strongly inclin’d;\r\n    When deeply reflecting what he could afford,\r\n    He fix’d him (slap dash!) at the Admiralty Board.\r\n\r\n    “This little Lord, conscious that he had no right\r\n    To a _Post_ which requir’d, not to Fiddle, but Fight;\r\n    Resolved that for once he’d assume martial airs,\r\n    And in the _Haymarket_ protect the FRENCH PLAYERS.\r\n\r\n    “He flew, he appear’d, and he heard a strange roar;\r\n    The like had ne’er tickl’d his soft ears before;\r\n    Then to set an example to future _Protectors_,\r\n    He drew forth his TILTER--_and at his_ ELECTORS.\r\n\r\n    “Shock’d at this rough treatment, in print they demand,\r\n    Why, ’gainst his best Friends, he thus lifted his hand;\r\n    His answer was full of mean _Equivocation_,\r\n    Which made them the jest and contempt of the Nation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA DISTURBED BY FRENCH VAGRANTS. LORD TRENTHAM\r\nFOR WESTMINSTER. 1749.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 121._]\r\n\r\nThe caricaturists endorsed this view. In “Britannia Disturbed, or an\r\nInvasion by French Vagrants, addressed to the worthy Electors of the\r\nCity of Westminster,” 1749, Lord Trentham is trying to force these\r\nimportations on Britannia, who is nursing “Lunn” (Rich), and “Fribble;”\r\nthese she declares “are my only Theatrical children, I will cherish\r\nno Foreign vagrants.” “Peg” Trentham, with drawn sword, is asserting\r\nthat he will perforce cram these “entertaining dear creatures” down\r\nthe throat of the nation; the strollers are like marionettes, and wear\r\nwooden shoes, as a hint of French neediness. Earl Gower is anxious\r\nfor his rash scion’s future prospects: “My long-headed son will smart\r\nfor this scheme.” “Push on, my Lord,” is the encouragement of “a\r\nsubscriber.” “Bludgeon-men, at two shillings a day,” engaged for the\r\nelection, are making a demonstration of force, and shouting for their\r\nemployer’s glorification.\r\n\r\nThis Westminster election is said to have been one of the most\r\nexpensive contests that the Government had as yet experienced. The\r\nfollowing epigram describes a supposed conversation between Lord\r\nTrentham and his father:--\r\n\r\n    “Quoth L--d G--r [_Lord Gower_] to his son, ‘Boy, thy frolic and place\r\n    Full deep will be paid for by us and his g----e [_grace_]:\r\n    Ten thousand twice over advanced!’--‘_Veritable,\r\n    Mon pere_,’ cry’d the youth; ‘but the D--e [_Duke_] you know’s able:\r\n    Nor blame my _French frolics_; since all men are certain,\r\n    You’re doing behind, what I did ‘fore the curtain.’”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the polling there appeared a majority for Lord\r\nTrentham, but his opponents demanded a scrutiny; and this scrutiny\r\nproved so laborious and difficult, or the parties interested in\r\nopposing the Court threw so many obstacles in the way, that it led to a\r\nquarrel with the House of Commons, which lasted some months, and gave a\r\ndouble celebrity to the Westminster Election of 1749.\r\n\r\nThe most was made of Lord Trentham’s Gallic proclivities, which were\r\nheld up to ridicule in ingenious satires. The following handbill is an\r\nexample of the squibs circulated by his opponents during the election:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “AUX ELECTEURS TRÈS DIGNES DE WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n  “MESSIEURS--\r\n\r\n    “Vos suffrages et Interêts sont desirés pour le Très Hon. mi\r\n    Lord Trentham,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “UN VERITABLE ANGLOIS.\r\n\r\n    “N.B.--L’on prie ses Amis de ses rendre à l’Hôtel François dans\r\n    le Marché au Foin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “TO MY LORD TRENTHAM.\r\n\r\n    “The King of France (my most glorious Monarch) being touched\r\n    with a lively sense of the obligations he owes your Lordship,\r\n    for the powerful protection you have given to his subjects\r\n    in England, honours you with his thanks, and commands me to\r\n    assure you, that your Lordship shall be the _Chief Manager_ of\r\n    his _Playhouse_ in England, as soon as your Lordship and your\r\n    Friends have brought those insolent rascals, the English, under\r\n    his dominion, being satisfied the measures your Lordship and\r\n    Friends now pursue cannot fail of your desired success.\r\n\r\n  “I have the honour to be\r\n\r\n  “Your Lordship’s most obliged humble Servant,\r\n\r\n  “MIREPOIX.\r\n  [French ambassador to the Court of\r\n  St. James’s, 1749-1751.]\r\n\r\n  “N.B.--Translated from the Original French.”\r\n\r\nGreat favour was shown to docile voters, while the refractory were\r\nsubject to crying injustices. The following handbill, circulated at the\r\ntime, exposes the meannesses to which a Duke of Bedford could descend\r\nin the interests of his candidate:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO THE WORTHY ELECTORS OF WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n    “A true Copy of a Letter sent to an inhabitant of Covent\r\n    Garden, who thought himself at liberty (though a Tenant to the\r\n    Duke of Bedford) to vote according to his _own conscience_;\r\n    which having done, he received the following:--‘I hereby give\r\n    you Notice, that you are to quit the house you rent of his\r\n    Grace the Duke of Bedford, situate in Bedford Street, in the\r\n    parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden, at Lady-Day next, or to pay\r\n    his Grace _Seventy-two pounds_ a year for the same from that\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n  “‘RT.

Who would not?\r\n\r\n    “⁂ _No_ rent due to his Grace.\r\n\r\n  “MATTHEW CREYGHTON,\r\n\r\n  “An insulted Elector of Westminster.\r\n\r\n    “N.B.--The House to Let.”\r\n\r\nThe general election of 1747 furnished Hogarth with a suggestion\r\nwhich employed his attention anterior to his more ambitious election\r\nseries. The House of Commons dissolved on the 18th of June, and the\r\nartist, taking time by the forelock, had his engraving “A Country\r\nInn-yard at the Time of Election” ready for publication while the\r\ncontests were occupying the public. As the print in question informs\r\nus, the cry of a “Babe of grace,” heard at the City election of 1701,\r\nwas repeated in 1747. The subject of the stage-coach and inn-yard\r\nis generally familiar. It contains the figures of the fat woman of\r\nabnormal proportions being assisted into the coach by the efforts of\r\nher meagre husband; while the equally obese landlady, seen at the bar\r\nwindow, which she fills, is vigorously pulling the bell to summons the\r\ncoach passengers. It is the background of the picture which illustrates\r\nthe present subject. The sleek landlord, wearing an apron, and with a\r\npair of snuffers pendent at his girdle, is presenting to an election\r\nagent a bill for the expenses incurred for the entertainment of his\r\nparty; that the amount is excessive is conveyed by the expression of\r\nsuspicion which pervades the features of the agent, who is preparing\r\nto settle the account; the landlord is evidently protesting as to his\r\nimmaculate reputation, while a part of the _Act_ against bribery on\r\nelections is projecting from his pocket. The galleries of the inn-yard\r\nare filled with spectators, who are favoured with a sight of the\r\nhumours of an election procession--a posse of men carrying sticks and\r\nbearing an effigy of a more than life-size baby, with a child’s rattle\r\nand hornbook, or A.B.C. Behind the chair, in which this figure is\r\nseated, is carried a flag with the inscription, “No Old Baby.” Nichols\r\nand Stevens, in their “Notes to Hogarth” (1810) have explained that\r\nthe “Old Baby” effigy and cry were resorted to by the antagonists of\r\nthe Hon. John Child, whose family, by Act of Parliament, took the name\r\nof Tylney in 1735. This candidate stood member for the county of Essex\r\nin opposition to Sir Robert Abdy and Mr. Bramstone. At the election, a\r\nman was placed on a bulk, with a mock infant in his arms, who, as he\r\nwhipped the babe in effigy, exclaimed, “What, you little Child, must\r\nyou be a member?” The member in question was then Viscount Castlemaine,\r\nand afterwards Earl Tylney. At this disputed election, it appeared,\r\nfrom the register book of the parish where this candidate was born,\r\nthat he was a “Child” in more than one respect, being but twenty years\r\nof age when returned for parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSATIRES ON THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS OF 1754.\r\n\r\n\r\nA favourite figure with the satirists was to portray wily party\r\nmanœuvrers as vermin-catchers, and those apostate representatives\r\nwho were ready to sell themselves and their parliamentary trust were\r\ndisplayed as the spoils of their craft. A cartoon appeared at the\r\ntime of these elections reflecting upon the tricks of administration.\r\nIt will be seen that nearly all these early caricaturists seem\r\ndisinterested, as their subjects oppose the dispensers of patronage.\r\nThe engraving shows the Duke of Newcastle seated beside St. Stephen’s\r\nChapel, and fishing for partisans among the late members, and, in\r\nanticipation, bidding for the adherence of the possible representatives\r\nin the coming parliament; this subject is entitled, “The Complete\r\nVermin-Catcher of Great Britain; or, the Old Trap new baited.” The\r\nminister’s line is dropped through the chimney of St. Stephen’s, and\r\nis baited with _Titles_, _Bribes_, _Places_, _Pensions_, _Secret\r\nCommissions_, and patronage in _Army_, _Navy_, and _Excise_. The\r\nintriguing duke, who was a proficient in corrupting others, and spent\r\na large fortune in electioneering wiles, is observing, “All Vermin\r\nmay be caught, tho’ differently, suit but the Bait to their various\r\nappetites. But there’s a species will take no Bait; would I could scare\r\nthem away; as they’re not Vermin, they will not answer my purpose.”\r\nThe greedy place-hunters are swarming plentifully, and are offering to\r\ndo any amount of dirty work, to “push for posts,” “Jews and no Jews,”\r\nbeing indifferent to everything but profit. The Pelhams, unscrupulous\r\nthemselves, were past-masters of the art of finding venal tools. It is\r\ndisclosed in the diary of Bubb Dodington (Lord Melcombe-Regis), the\r\nmanager of the Leicester House intrigues, and himself an accomplished\r\nadept in dissimulation, how disreputably the Duke of Newcastle\r\ncontrived to secure Bubb’s parliamentary influence (six seats) “for\r\nnothing!”\r\n\r\nThe corrupt character of a large average of those sent to the Commons\r\nas representatives of the people was in perfect keeping with the no\r\nless greedy boroughmongers who found them seats and the mercenary\r\nvoters, their constituents by presumption; what a man bought--and\r\nin those days almost everything political had its price and was\r\npurchasable--he held himself justified in selling when the chance\r\noccurred. A satirical rendering of the imperfections then supposed to\r\naffect the body of the senate appeared at the time of these elections\r\nof 1754, when, by wholesale bribery, the Administration was, at an\r\nenormous cost, doing its utmost to degrade the entire system of\r\nrepresentation:--“Dissection of a Dead Member (of Parliament).” The\r\nsubject is extended upon a table for autopsy, five surgeons have\r\nseverally examined the different functions, and the results of their\r\npost-mortem inspection is thus stated:--\r\n\r\n    _1st Doctor._ The Brain is very foul and muddy, it has a\r\n    Contusion, or, as it may be called, a soft place in it, locked\r\n    in the stone kitchen by way of qualification.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Doctor._ Ay, ay, he knocked his head too hard against\r\n    politics and bruisified his pericranium. He was bred a\r\n    Foxhunter.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Doctor._ The _Vena Cava_ of the _Thorax_ makes a noise,\r\n    and sounds as if one should say, “My country be damn’d,” and\r\n    his intestines have got, I think, ’tis “Bribery,” wrote on\r\n    them--not a drop of good blood in his heart.\r\n\r\n    _4th Doctor._ Bribery, the _Auri Sacra fames_ of the\r\n    ancients--ay ’twas a diet he was fond of, ’twas his Breakfast,\r\n    Dinner, and Supper, and affected all the corpuscles of his\r\n    corporeal system, it was his _Insanible Membrum_.\r\n\r\n    _5th Doctor._ There’s a most potent Fœtor exhales as if the\r\n    whole body was corrupted--if the bones are touched it won’t\r\n    make an Anatomy.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1754 are rendered more interesting to later\r\ngenerations from the circumstance that the famous series of paintings\r\nby Hogarth, better known by the engravings as the “Four Plates of\r\nan Election,” owe their origin to the electoral contests which\r\nensued on the parliamentary dissolution, April 8, 1754. Before that\r\ndate the tendency of events was shadowed forth. For instance, Henry\r\nPelham, a pupil of Walpole’s, who combined the offices of first lord\r\nof the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer, passed the Jews’\r\nNaturalization Bill in June, 1753, chiefly by his own exertions;\r\nbut reaping thereby an enlarged measure of unpopularity--sufficient\r\nto jeopardize his party and his future career, if not to extinguish\r\nthe political prospects of the Pelhams beyond rehabilitation--this\r\ndetrimental concession was recalled, and, in the face of a general\r\nelection and its possible eventualities, the Bill was repealed. The\r\nhostile feeling provoked by the measure in question still remained,\r\nand although the principal agent on its introduction had himself\r\ndeparted, it exercised, as will be seen in the political satires, much\r\ninfluence over the elections of 1754, in the way of helping the return\r\nof fresh opposition candidates, and defeating ministerial nominees.\r\nHenry Pelham, the prominent figure of the administration, expired in\r\nthe full tide of his unpopularity. That enmity--consequent upon his\r\nacts--followed him to the tomb is illustrated by a spirited caricature,\r\npublished on his death, and disclosing the probable reception which\r\nawaited the late premier on the other side of the Styx. “His Arrival at\r\nhis Country Retirement and Reception,” March 6, 1754 (the anniversary\r\nof Pelham’s decease). In this etching Henry Pelham is entering on\r\nhis future state, introduced to the infernal regions by a demon\r\nchamberlain. The “salle des pas perdus,” is not so easy as anticipated;\r\nPelham is observing to his conductor:--“It was much easier walking in\r\nthe Treasury. I hope my successor finds it so.” The ghosts of departed\r\nstatesmen are variously greeting the arrival of the latest addition\r\nto their class. His predecessor, Sir Robert Walpole, is welcoming a\r\nworthy pupil: “O, this is a child of my own bringing up. I found him a\r\npromising Genius for dirty work, I therefore did all I could to gain\r\nhim the succession at my retirement hither, knowing that some of his\r\nblack strokes would make me appear as fair as alabaster. He has done\r\nit in several respects, but chiefly in getting the Naturalization of\r\nthe Jews passed,--have any of you great Genius’s done anything equal?”\r\nThe spirit of Judge Jeffreys is declaring, “All my transactions in\r\nthe West were but a joke to that great achievement.” The disembodied\r\nCardinal Wolsey is observing, “Is that the choice spirit you have so\r\noften described? I made pretty large strides towards making the people\r\nswallow down what I thought proper--but this beats all my ‘_Ego et Rex\r\nMeus’s_’ out of doors!” A shade affirms, “We are all puny statesmen to\r\nhim;” and the most astute politicians of history are voted beginners\r\nbeside Pelham--“If you, old Machiavel, had known him in your days, he’d\r\na’ lent you a lift.”\r\n\r\nIn the elections which were held in April, 1754, the Court seems\r\nto have experienced less opposition than might have been expected;\r\nfor although the spirit of the antagonistic “Leicester House party”\r\nhad been damped by the death of the Prince of Wales, which occurred\r\nunexpectedly in March, 1751, it now showed signs of reviving.\r\n\r\nThe contest for the City of London gave rise to several interesting\r\ncaricatures. The humours of canvassing are displayed in “The\r\nLiveryman’s Levée” (April, 1754), which represents an elector, a\r\nself-sufficient tailor, with his vulgar wife. The pair are receiving\r\nthe obsequious bows of five of the candidates, who, in 1754, put up for\r\nthe City of London. The absence of Sir John Barnard, the celebrated\r\ncity patriot, is professionally marked by a suit hanging on the\r\nwall,--“A Plain Suit of Broadcloth for Sir John Steady.” The liveryman\r\nis insolently resenting the independence of the favourite candidate:\r\n“Where’s Sir John? I think he is greatly wanting in his duty. Does\r\nhe imagine that a man of my figure is to be trifled with? Don’t he\r\nknow that we expect to be waited on?” There are other allusions to the\r\nrecommendations for and objections against the respective candidates.\r\n\r\nAs the dissolution of parliament approached, satirical views of the\r\nsituation became numerous, and there appeared various well-executed\r\ncaricatures upon the subject of the city election. In “The City Up\r\nand Down; or, the Candidates Pois’d,” the candidates were represented\r\nperched upon suspended boxes, part of a huge revolving machine. Sir\r\nJohn Barnard, Slingsby Bethel, and William Beckford are occupying the\r\nupper seats; they had represented the city in the last parliament, and,\r\nas there were no objections against their names, their re-election was\r\nconsidered secure. In a side box is Sir Richard Glyn, who was defeated;\r\nin another, somewhat lower, is Sir Robert Ladbrooke, a new candidate,\r\nwho was successful; below these is a fourth box, in which are Sir Crisp\r\nGascoyne and Sir William Calvert; the latter, though one of the former\r\nrepresentatives, secured the fewest votes in 1754. The reason for\r\nthis falling-off in favour is explained by the caricature; Calvert is\r\nsurrounded by Jews, who are assuring him:--“You have all our interest,\r\nfor your zealous support of our Bill!”--“Confound your Bill; now I\r\nhave no hope left,” replies Sir William, whose exertions on behalf of\r\nthis measure lost him his seat. Barnard is declaring, “I am, strictly\r\nspeaking, neither a friend to the Jews nor their enemy; excepting when\r\nthey aim at having equal Rights and Privileges with my fellow-citizens\r\nand countrymen.” While the inflexible Beckford, who later was Lord\r\nChatham’s “mouth-piece in the Commons,” asserts, “It becomes a Man of\r\nCharacter to keep good Company.” Ladbrooke, who was a distiller, is\r\ndeclaring he “should like to be in good company too,” but “fears it\r\nwill be with the two kings”--“The King of the Jews” being Calvert the\r\nbrewer, and Gascoyne, “King of the Gipsies.” There are allusions to\r\nthe occupations of the candidates; the voters are declaring, “If the\r\ngin-merchant [Ladbrooke] gets in, gin will be cheaper.” Other electors\r\nrefer to Gascoyne and Calvert as “two very good beer-makers.” On\r\nthe opposite side of the river is shown Sampson Gideon, a prominent\r\nfinancier of his day, and afterwards knighted,--he is conducted by\r\nSatan, and his hat is filled with gold for purposes of bribery; he is\r\neager to tamper with the balance of the boxes in the “great Up and Down\r\nmachine;”--“If I was over I would turn the poise, though it cost me the\r\nprofits of the last Lottery.” Gideon was a strenuous supporter of those\r\nwho voted for the Jews’ Naturalization Bill, and, before the repeal of\r\nthat measure, held hopes of getting into parliament. He is frequently\r\nalluded to in the electioneering squibs of the time. That he had\r\nsubstantial reasons for interesting himself in behalf of those in power\r\nappears from the “Report of the Committee appointed to investigate\r\nthe Lottery of 1753,” where it is stated that “Sampson Gideon became\r\nproprietor of more than six thousand tickets, which he sold at a\r\npremium.” Preference allotments, being highly profitable, were useful\r\nas administrative patronage.\r\n\r\nThe city election is further illustrated by an engraving called, “A\r\nStir in the City; or, some Folks at Guildhall,” which represents\r\nvarious groups of citizens and persons prominent at the time, assembled\r\nbefore the Guildhall, while the six candidates are borne along on\r\na long frame with six seats, and supported on men’s shoulders, the\r\nprocession being headed by a bishop; the party is received in state by\r\nthe sheriffs, who are assuring the prelate, “as my Lord Rabbi,” that\r\n“the Guildhall is not the Synagogue,” and “no sons of Levi have place\r\nhere;”--in general, the bishops supported the Naturalization Bill.\r\nDr. Ward, then before the public as an advertizing pill-vendor, is\r\nfrom his coach distributing quack nostrums; he is acknowledging that\r\n“not one will cure an Election Fever.” Gascoyne and Mary Squires, the\r\ngipsy, crooked and leaning on her staff, are represented, with Hogarth\r\nbeside them; this refers to the charges against Squires brought by\r\nElizabeth Canning, and proved false on further investigation by Sir C.\r\nGascoyne, who retired from the city canvass, and successfully contested\r\nSouthwark. Candidates for Hertford, Winchester, and other places are\r\nalso introduced. A group of Jews stand by the Guildhall; one cries,\r\n“What a shame it is we have no votes!” Sampson Gideon is present, and\r\nanother is confidentially remarking to him, “Tho’ you can’t vote,\r\nSampson, you may still do business there;” to which the contractor\r\nreplies, in reference to his expectation of sitting in parliament had\r\nthe Act to remove the disabilities of the Jews continued in force,\r\n“I thought to have voted in another Building;” while a lean Hebrew\r\nneighbour whispers, “You have an excellent hand at a Lottery, all the\r\nworld knows.” Orator Henley, standing in his tub, is recommending\r\nhis butcher friends from Newport Market to convert the voters into\r\nJews; and a hawker is crying, “Sir Andrew Freeport’s Address [to the\r\nLivery of London] for nothing.” The state of the polls for London and\r\nOxfordshire are also given.\r\n\r\nOf the six candidates carried in chairs, two and two, Sir John\r\nBarnard (at the head of the poll, 3553), is saying, “These are my\r\nfellow-citizens; I must not forsake them in my old age, for I always\r\nloved them.” Slingsby Bethel (3547), as president of the Free British\r\nFishery Society, promises “the Herring Fishery shall thrive.” Beckford\r\n(2941) is made to declare, “I’ll vote for a new Bridge [Blackfriars];\r\nbut not for a new Jew Bill.” Sir R. Ladbrooke (3390) is present, and so\r\nare the defeated candidates, Sir Richard Glyn, and, at the bottom of\r\nthe poll, Sir W. Calvert, with the Jew Bill in his pocket--for which he\r\nasserts he “only voted!”\r\n\r\nA further explanation of the allusions conveyed in this satire is\r\nafforded by the verses which accompanied the design:--\r\n\r\n    “O! see my Raree Show, good Folks,\r\n    All you who love Election Jokes,\r\n    You, John a Stiles! and John a Nokes,\r\n                          Doodle, Doodle, Do.\r\n\r\n    “See Mr. Sheriff with his wand\r\n    Has put the Bishop at a stand,\r\n    Who takes Guildhall for Holy Land.\r\n\r\n    “There’s Sampson, full of discontent,\r\n    Because he’s not in Parliament;\r\n    Which was his very heart’s Intent.\r\n\r\n    “See Henley, with his surgeons there,\r\n    For Jew conversion all prepare,\r\n    Butchers cure cases, I declare.\r\n\r\n    “Sir Andrew Freeport has his eye\r\n    Upon the List and the Livery,\r\n    Fox, Barnard, Bethel, Beckford cry.\r\n\r\n    “A Beauty, Mistress Squires, see,\r\n    For Mr. Hogarth and I agree,\r\n    Beauty’s a Lane as crooked as she.\r\n\r\n    “There Doctor Ward, with looks demure,\r\n    Is giving his pills, but he is sure\r\n    Election fevers have no cure.”\r\n\r\nThe struggle for election was also epitomized under the popular\r\nparaphrase of a race-course: “The Parliamentary Race; or, the City\r\nJockies” (April, 1754). Sir John Barnard is first on “Steady,” Mr.\r\nSlingsby Bethel is second on “Buzzard;” Sir R. Ladbrooke on “Trimmer,”\r\nand William Beckford on “Will o’ the Wisp,” are making great exertions\r\nto cut out Sir Richard Glyn on “Little Driver,” who is flogging his\r\nhorse to keep the third place, which he ultimately lost, his name\r\nstanding fifth at the close of the poll; Sir Crisp Gascoyne is left\r\nbehind with “Miss Canning;” Sir William Calvert has come to grief,\r\nhis horse, “Loose Legs,” having stumbled over a Jew pedlar, and, with\r\nthe rider, been thrown out of the race. The contest is witnessed by\r\nhorsemen, gentlemen on foot occupying the stand which the horses must\r\npass, and the usual crowd of spectators present on a race-course,\r\nincluding an itinerant gin-seller dispensing spirits to workmen, in\r\nallusion to the distiller, Sir R. Ladbrooke. Various observations are\r\nmade on the chances of the race: “Old Steady [Barnard] is in first!”\r\n“Buzzard [Bethel] will blunder in second!” “Will o’ the Wisp [Beckford]\r\nhas blood in him!” and other comments, as indicated above. The state of\r\nthe “Parliamentary Stakes” is expounded in a copy of verses, possibly a\r\nparody after one of Tom D’Urfey’s odd ditties:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE PARLIAMENTARY RACE; OR, THE CITY JOCKIES.\r\n\r\n    “O! Shade of D’Urfey, grant me Vit-a\r\n    To sing those Jockies of the city,\r\n    Who want in Parliament to get-a\r\n                        Doodle, Doodle, Do.\r\n\r\n    “First comes Sir John, who wins the day;\r\n    His horse is ready to run away,\r\n    Nor will at all for ‘Loose Legs’ stay.\r\n\r\n    “But who is he on that scrambling Brute?\r\n    What, don’t you know, Sir, ’tis past dispute?\r\n    O! that is Alderman Orator Mute.\r\n\r\n    “Who flogs so hard, the third to be in?\r\n    O, that is a Knight, Sir Richard Glyn,\r\n    And ‘Little Driver,’ too, will win.\r\n\r\n    “O! see how he spins there, ‘Will of the Wisp’-a,\r\n    He’ll distance ‘Miss Canning,’ and Sir Crisp-a,\r\n    And all the Broomstaffs of the Gipsy.\r\n\r\n    “‘O! Damn the Jew,’ Sir William cries,\r\n    As o’er his horse he headlong flies.\r\n    Ay, that damn’d Jew threw dust in his Eyes.\r\n\r\n    “Sir Robert upon his ‘Trimming Nag’\r\n    Has too much spirit too long to lag,\r\n    He soon will pass the distance-flag.\r\n\r\n    “O! where’s ‘Miss Canning’? Out of sight,\r\n    Ay, her best strokes are in the night,\r\n    Now bring her up--or never, Knight.”\r\n\r\nThe summary of both the London and the Oxfordshire contests, which\r\nwere regarded by ministers as of the utmost consequence, are given\r\npictorially in a carefully engraved print, entitled “All the World\r\nin a Hurry; or, the Road from London to Oxford,” April, 1754. At\r\nthe extremities of the plate are views of the respective cities; to\r\nthese the candidates and their supporters are proceeding on horse and\r\nfoot, by two opposite lines of road. To the right, where the London\r\ncavalcade may be taken to commence, the largest mounted figure, and\r\nthat nearest the spectator, is intended for Sir John Barnard, the head\r\nof the poll, who is trotting along at a steady pace, contented with\r\nhis progress: “My steed is slow, but sure, Sir Robert.” Sir Robert\r\nLadbrooke, who is urging on his own career, replies, “What! without a\r\nspur, Sir John?”--Barnard having resorted to no election manœuvres,\r\nand not even canvassed the voters. Alderman Slingsby Bethel, jogging\r\nalong comfortably in his gig, is observing; “I’ll leave my Election\r\nto the Arbitration of the Livery.” Sir Richard Glyn’s pace, in a\r\npost-chaise and pair, is checked by a group of pedestrians in the\r\npathway; “What the Devil can’t you get before the Jews, Tom?” he is\r\ninquiring of his postillion, who replies, “They are in possession of\r\nthe Road, Sir Richard:” Glyn, although for some time third in the\r\nvoting, finally failed in his election. Also behind the group of\r\nfoot-passengers are two prosperous-looking personages on horseback,\r\nSir William Calvert and William Beckford, both late members for the\r\ncity; the former is bantering his companion, “You won’t be first at\r\nGuildhall, Brother Beckford;” the famous patriot was returned third\r\non the poll at the election of 1754: his rival retorts, alluding to\r\nCalvert’s position at the previous contest, “Nor you second, Sir\r\nWilliam;” the support Calvert had lent the Jews’ Naturalization Bill\r\nwas the cause of his being rejected in 1754. In the centre of the\r\ngroup of Hebrew obstructives is a stout man, mopping his forehead and\r\ncomplaining, as he drags along wearily, “Verily, England is too hot at\r\nthis time of the year!”--this figure represents Sir Sampson Gideon,\r\nthe loan contractor, who is surrounded by his co-religionists. One\r\nlong-bearded Israelite is crying that “Sampson refuses to sweat a\r\nlittle for our friend Sir William!” (Calvert); another Jew declares,\r\n“Sir William has been sweated often on our account;” and a third is\r\nsaying, “We must give him a little Grease for once” (_i.e._ spend\r\nmoney to further his election),--this refers to the encouragement the\r\nJews offered Sir William Calvert, support rendered in return for his\r\nassistance in passing the Jews’ Naturalization Bill, which nearly cost\r\nthe ministry their working majority, while one of the city members,\r\nCalvert, the great brewer of the day, lost both his popularity and his\r\nplace in parliament. This measure had been passed by the Pelhams in\r\nthe last session, and, until its repeal, Sampson Gideon looked forward\r\nto a seat as a representative of the City of London. On the eve of\r\nthe dissolution the ministers had repealed their unpopular Bill, and\r\nthis concession to public opinion was regarded as an electioneering\r\nstratagem on their part. At the other end of the London group is Sir\r\nCrisp Gascoyne, who gave up his candidature for the city, and put\r\nup for Southwark, where he was rejected. At this time Sir Crisp was\r\nlabouring under undeserved disfavour owing to his exertions to procure\r\nthe conviction of Elizabeth Canning, the perjuress, for a false\r\naccusation against the gipsy, Mary Squires, who was, through Canning’s\r\ndevices, condemned to death, but was subsequently pardoned, after\r\nGascoyne’s investigation had established her innocence, and the true\r\nfacts were made public. The case in question, which was not cleared up\r\nat the time of the elections, was the cause of that unpopularity which\r\ncost Sir Crisp his seat; in the engraving, he is made to exclaim, “Why,\r\nwhere are you, Mother Squires, with your infernal troop?”--Squires was\r\nalleged to be a witch! A friend riding beside him is pointing upwards,\r\n“Infernal! Sir Crisp? why, they are up in the air yonder!”--indicating\r\na witch and three weird sisters riding on broomsticks over the heads\r\nof the parliamentary cavalcade. The leader, intended for the gipsy, is\r\nexclaiming, “I am afraid we are too late, sisters.” The spectators\r\nare standing aside to let the procession pass; one is shouting bravely\r\nfor the “tried members, Barnard and England for ever, huzza!” and\r\ntwo others are abusing Gideon’s friends, who have hindered Calvert’s\r\nelection. “Damn the Jews! they are always in the way,” “Turn ’em out of\r\nthe Road.” A copy of verses further elucidates the subject:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL THE WORLD IN A HURRY; OR, THE ROAD FROM LONDON TO\r\nOXFORD. 1754.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 134._]\r\n\r\n\r\n“LONDON.\r\n\r\n    “‘O! what! without a spur, Sir John,\r\n    And yet your steed is getting on?’\r\n    ‘The steed is a good one I’m upon.’\r\n\r\n    “Says Madame Squires, in the air,\r\n    ‘Our friend Sir Crisp need never fear--\r\n    Tho’ we are late, we will be there.’\r\n\r\n    “Sir William is not first, ’tis true,\r\n    Nor Barnard second, tho’ True Blue,\r\n    Glyn will be third--Jack! what say you?\r\n\r\n    “If there is an honest man in the nation\r\n    ’Tis Bethel, I’ll say it without hesitation,\r\n    Nor leave it even to his own arbitration.”\r\n\r\nThe half of the engraving of “All the World in a Hurry,” having\r\nreference to the Oxfordshire elections, may be taken as an introduction\r\nto Hogarth’s famous series of “The Election;” the actual candidates,\r\nbesides the contest, being set forth in this earlier version.\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen galloping in advance of their competitors represent\r\nLord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood, the “True Blue” candidates, who\r\ngained the head of the poll, and were returned as “sitting members,”\r\nbut were afterwards, “on a controverted election petition,” displaced\r\nto make room for Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner, the representatives\r\nof the ruling party, who had been supported from the first with the\r\nentire government interest, and by a decision of the House of Commons\r\nwere ultimately seated.\r\n\r\nIn the engraved version of this spirited competition, Lord Wenman is\r\nmade to remark, “They are not far behind us, Sir James;” to which\r\nDashwood responds, “Too far, my lord, to get up with us.” That every\r\nexertion was made is illustrated by the driver of the post-chaise\r\nwhich contains the ministerial nominees; the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nas postillion, is declaring “his jades, _i.e._ the voters, begin\r\nto kick”--the elections for Oxfordshire having been in the control\r\nof the Marlborough family at former elections; and, in fact, the\r\nsame influence was so preponderating, that no opposition after the\r\nelection of 1754, now in question, was offered in the county until\r\n1826,--another Sir G. Dashwood was unsuccessful in the Whig interest\r\nin 1830. Sir Edward Turner and Lord Parker are in the ministerial\r\npost-chaise; the duke is proposing to throw over one of his\r\nnominees--“Sir Edward, you had better get out;” his colleague, however,\r\nis resisting this desertion--“You won’t leave me single, Sir Edward?”\r\nThe latter is trying to spur their postillion forwards: “Push hard, my\r\nLord Duke, or we shan’t get in.” Two Whig notabilities are riding at a\r\ndistance; one is observing, “Sir James [Dashwood] and my Lord [Wenman]\r\nhave got ground on ’em;” his neighbour is confidently replying, “Ay,\r\nand they’ll keep it, my boys.”\r\n\r\nLast comes the great man of the administration, driving his phaeton\r\nand six. He bids a mounted messenger to “ride forward, and tell my\r\nLord Duke I would have been with him, but my horses took fright at\r\na funeral, and won’t pull together;” the Duke of Newcastle is the\r\nperson represented, and the circumstance to which he attributes\r\nthe restiveness of his six-in-hand was the death, just before the\r\ndissolution of parliament, of his brother Henry Pelham, a man of\r\nsuperior abilities to the duke, who had filled the same offices with a\r\nbetter hold on his team.\r\n\r\n\r\n“OXFORD.\r\n\r\n    “From London into Oxford Town,\r\n    See all the world is hurrying down,\r\n    Dashwood and Wenman for a crown.\r\n                    Doodle, Doodle, Do.\r\n\r\n    “The Duke of Newcastle in his Fly\r\n    Cannot get up to his grace; for why?\r\n    The Funeral! Ah! men will die.\r\n\r\n    “Sir Edward in the chaise you see;\r\n    ‘Get out, Sir Edward!’ ‘O, no!’ says he;\r\n    ‘What,’ cries my Lord, ‘must I single be?’\r\n\r\n    “‘My jades begin to kick,’ says his Grace;\r\n    ‘Sir, you had better leave the place,\r\n    And never look them in the face.’”\r\n\r\nThe elections in Oxfordshire were marked by a more animated conflict\r\nthan elsewhere; the Jacobite faction was still strong there, although\r\nthe comparatively recent fate of those who had declared for the\r\nPretender served to keep these sympathies within discreet limits.\r\nThe contest was strongly marked by incidents which have survived\r\nin the four famous election pictures painted by William Hogarth,\r\nthe unequalled originals of which, still in fine condition, are now\r\nsomewhat lost to the public in Sir John Soane’s Museum,[44] but of\r\nwhich the engravings are most familiar. Hogarth sold the series to\r\nhis friend David Garrick for the modest price of 200 guineas; at the\r\nsale of Mrs. Garrick’s effects, in 1823, they were secured by Sir\r\nJohn Soane for the corresponding moderate sum of £1732 10_s._ The\r\n“Election Entertainment” was exhibited at Spring Gardens in 1761.\r\nThese characteristic satires seem to apply to electioneering episodes\r\nin general, not only of the eighteenth century, but until within the\r\npresent; a recapitulation of the principal allusions, however, will\r\nshow that these pictures are composed of studies for the most part\r\ndrawn from life, and founded on the actualities of the 1754 contest\r\nin Oxfordshire. The “Election Entertainment,” the first of these\r\nplates, is so well known that it was felt unnecessary to reproduce any\r\nof its incidents. This scene might he taken as a generalistic view\r\nof the electioneering hospitality and “open house,” one of the first\r\nsteps towards conciliating support, but that the three “party-cries”\r\ndistinctive of this particular struggle are all pictorially\r\nperpetuated. The scene embodies gluttony, turbulence, and false\r\npatriotism, but bribery and violent intimidation prevail above all.\r\nThe mayor, who occupies the seat of honour, has succumbed to a surfeit\r\nof oysters, and a phlebotomist of the barber tribe is endeavouring to\r\nblood his arm and cool his head at one time. A ministerial-looking\r\npersonage is treated with coarse familiarity, while a youthful aspirant\r\nfor popular favour is submitting to tipsified indignities at the hands\r\nof his temporary associates. Nichols, who mentions certain assurances\r\nhe received from Hogarth as to the fact that, with one exception, none\r\nof the figures were intended for portraits, affects to recognize the\r\nhandsome candidate.[45] This modish gentleman has been treating the\r\nfair sex to gloves, buff or orange favours, and other gear, from the\r\npack of a pedlar of the Hebrew persuasion, who is also dealing in notes\r\nof hand; he holds one for £20 from the candidate, signed “R. Pention”\r\n(Pension being the word). While the Court party is regaling the Buffs,\r\nor Old Interest, at the leading tavern, their opponents, the Blues, are\r\nmaking an out-of-door demonstration; so that a view of the humours of\r\nboth sides is simultaneously afforded. The New Interest procession is\r\ncomposed of “bludgeon-men,” bearing an effigy of the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nwith the colours of the Old Interest, and a placard round his neck,\r\n“No Jews,” in allusion to the unpopular Act introduced by the Pelhams\r\n(1752) to permit the naturalization of foreign Jews. Another cry,\r\ninscribed on a blue standard, is “Liberty and Prosperity,” while a\r\nhuge blue flag bears the inscription, “Increase and multiply in spite\r\nof old ----,”[46] in reference to the recent Act for the regulation of\r\nmarriages, which had encountered much opposition and given offence to\r\nthe multitude. An animated exchange of missiles between the political\r\nantagonists is proceeding through the window; those within are\r\nstanding a siege from showers of bricks, to which they are replying\r\nwith a volley of fluids and furniture showered on the heads of the\r\npassing patriots; while a rival detachment of Old Interest hirelings,\r\ndisplaying their orange cockades, being armed with oak cudgels, and\r\nheaded by a partisan with a drawn sword, is sallying forth to make a\r\ndiversion on the besiegers. A champion Orange bludgeon-man, seated on\r\nthe floor in the foreground, has evidently returned from a raid on\r\nthe foe, in which he has had his head broken, but he has succeeded\r\nin carrying off one of the obnoxious blue standards. A butcher, with\r\na “Pro Patria” favour twisted round his head, is pouring gin upon\r\nthe bruiser’s cracked cranium, which he has first plastered with a\r\n“Your vote and interest” card; the doughty champion is reviving his\r\nspirits with the same stimulant; his foot is trampling upon the spoils\r\nof victory, the broken staff and the flag inscribed, “Give us our\r\neleven days,”--another whimsical popular party cry, explained by the\r\nalteration in the style, introduced in the session 1751, to correct\r\nthe calendar according to the Georgian computation, then adopted by\r\nmost European nations. To equalize the number of days, so that the new\r\nyear should in future begin on the 1st of January, eleven intermediate\r\ndays were for that occasion passed over between the 2nd and 14th of\r\nSeptember, 1752, so that the day succeeding the 2nd of that month would\r\nbe reckoned as the 14th--an alteration which provoked discontent,\r\nand, in spite of its obvious convenience, was denounced as a Popish\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n    “In seventeen hundred and fifty-three,\r\n    The style was changed to P--p--ry [_Popery_],\r\n    But that it is lik’d, we don’t all agree;\r\n                      Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\n    “When the country folk first heard of this act,\r\n    That old father Style was condemned to be rack’d,\r\n    And robb’d of his time, which appears to be fact,\r\n                      Which nobody can deny;\r\n\r\n    “It puzzl’d their brains, their senses perplex’d,\r\n    And all the old ladies were very much vex’d,\r\n    Not dreaming that Levites would alter our text;\r\n                      Which nobody can deny.”\r\n\r\n  (_The Jew’s Triumph._)\r\n\r\nThe business of the meeting, regarding the gluttony and drunkenness\r\namong the diversions, is centred in bribery. The Buff parliamentary\r\nagent has a seat next the unconscious municipal in the chair; before\r\nhim is a ledger ruled with columns for “sure votes” and “doubtful.” The\r\noccupations of this important factotum are deranged by a flying brick\r\nfrom the opposition, which has struck home on his temple, bringing\r\nhim down headlong, with destruction to objects around. Amid much\r\nhorse-play and practical joking--to the strains of an extraordinary\r\norchestra--promises of payment, bank-notes, and broad-pieces are being\r\nput into circulation. A lean Methodist tailor, with Blue sympathies,\r\nand who is suffering from qualms of conscience, is placed between two\r\nfires, the personal violence of his wife, with a half-shod offspring\r\nappealing for new shoes, while a clerkly agent is pressing on his\r\nacceptance a handful of silver coins to remove his pious scruples.\r\nAlthough bribery was so generally admitted, and stalked barefaced\r\nthroughout the country, it was even then contrary to statute. With\r\nhis usual irony, the painter has shown the “Act against Bribery and\r\nCorruption” turned into pipe-lights, and thrown aside in the tray\r\nof “long clays,” together with a packet of tobacco, for the use of\r\nsmokers. This latter bears the name of “Kirton’s best,” and has its\r\npeculiar significance: Nichols records that Kirton “was a tobacconist\r\nby St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleet Street, who ruined his health and\r\nconstitution, as well as impaired his circumstances, by being busy in\r\nthe Oxfordshire election of 1754.” The pictures on the walls, according\r\nto Hogarth’s practice, greatly assist the story: there is a view,\r\npresumably of Oxford from the river--the city is represented in flames;\r\nan undertaker’s escutcheon--the field sable bears three gold pieces,\r\nwith a chevron, the motto “Speak and Have,” surmounted by an open\r\nmouth by way of crest proper. A portrait of William, Prince of Orange,\r\nas the Protestant prince of the Revolution, has been slashed across by\r\nrabid and indignant Jacobites, in allusion to the faction then supposed\r\nto have had much influence in Oxford; branches of laurel are entwined\r\nround a buff flag, marked “Liberty and Loyalty,” the standard of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nFurther allusions to the respective Houses of Stuart and Hanover may\r\nbe detected in the plate, “Canvassing for Votes,” in the signs of the\r\n“Royal Oak,” _versus_ “The Crown.” All the taverns are pressed into\r\nthe service of the candidates as a matter of course, the enterprising\r\ncompetitors striving to secure the preponderance of publicans, their\r\ninterest, friends, and followers. “Tim Partitool, Esq.,” possibly a\r\nhit at Bubb Dodington, whose person, as sketched by Hogarth, may be\r\nidentified in at least one picture of this series, is located at the\r\n“Royal Oak.” This enterprising gentleman, as depicted on his canvass,\r\nis nicknamed “Punch,” also indicative of Bubb’s unmistakable figure. A\r\nporter has brought two packages, evidently polling cards, inscribed,\r\n“Sir, your vote and interest;” one of these parcels is directed “at\r\nPunch’s, at the ‘Royal Oak’ Yard,” and to the candidate in question the\r\nbearer is presenting a note with the superscription, “Tim Partitool,\r\nEsq.” Above this gentleman’s head, and partly concealing the painted\r\nsignboard of Charles II. in the oak, with the three crowns of the\r\nUnited Kingdom among the branches, is a pictorial poster in two\r\ncompartments. In the upper one are shown the Treasury and Horse Guards,\r\nboth burlesqued; while from the tall story of the former flows a stream\r\nof gold, which is being packed into sacks for conveyance by waggon into\r\nthe country--there to be distributed for the purposes of bribery--to\r\nstrengthen the party already in power, known as the Old Interest (their\r\nown). The way this is to come about is shown in the lower compartment\r\nof the painted cloth: “Punch, candidate for Guzzledown,” the\r\n_farceur_, with his protuberant rotundity of back and corporation, has\r\na wheel-barrow before him, filled with bags of money, marked £7000 and\r\n£9000, and in all amounting to a considerable sum; he is casting about\r\nthe broad-pieces in a shower from a ladle, and they are caught in the\r\nhats of expectant electors.\r\n\r\n    “See from the Treasury flows the gold,\r\n    To show that those who’re _bought_ are _sold_!\r\n    Come, Perjury, meet it on the road--\r\n    ’Tis all your own--a waggon-load.\r\n    Ye party fools, ye courtier tribe,\r\n    Who gain no vote without a bribe,\r\n    Lavishly kind, yet insincere,\r\n    Behold in Punch yourselves appear.\r\n    And you, ye fools, who poll for pay,\r\n    Ye little great men of a day,\r\n    For whom your favourite will not care,\r\n    Observe how much bewitch’d you are.”\r\n\r\nThe candidate is treating all around, within the inn, as seen in\r\nthe bar-parlour, his followers are feeding gluttonously; in the\r\nbalcony above are two fair nymphs, whose favour he is conciliating\r\nby purchasing trinkets from a Jew pedlar. A farmer voter of some\r\ninfluence, probably a squire of the Tony Lumpkin order, who has ridden\r\ninto Guzzledown, is making the most of his opportunities: the landlords\r\nof the rival inns are ostensibly pressing him to accept invitations\r\nto dinner at the respective head-quarters; the host of the Royal Oak\r\nis pouring a shower of silver into the receptive palm held out by the\r\nwary elector, while the other hand receives the broad golden retainer\r\nof “The Crown.” The landlady has a lapful of money, while one of\r\nGeorge’s grenadiers (like those seen in “The March to Finchley”) is\r\nslyly watching the reckoning of the plunder, probably with an eye to\r\nspoliation on his own account. The Crown, which is also the Excise\r\nOffice, is the scene of an animated contest, rival bludgeon-men are\r\nin fierce conflict at the doorway, furniture and stones are being\r\nthrown about, and a man from the window is discharging a gun into the\r\nthick of the fray below--an allusion to a murderous episode which\r\nreally occurred. The sign of the Crown, suspended to a huge beam, is\r\nin process of removal; a man above, on the wrong side of the support,\r\nis sawing it through, while confederates below are dragging it down\r\nby force: this is also figurative--the man above, who is assisting to\r\ndemolish the Crown, will come down simultaneously, while those beneath\r\nit will be crushed by its fall. At a third house is the sign of the\r\nPorto Bello, at the side door of which is seen a barber demonstrating\r\nwith pieces of tobacco-pipe the manner in which Porto Bello was itself\r\ntaken with six ships only; his companion, a cobbler, has given up work,\r\nhaving received sufficient money from the elections to afford to forego\r\ntoil for the present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELECTION AT OXFORD.--CANVASSING FOR VOTES. BY W.\r\nHOGARTH. 1754.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OXFORDSHIRE ELECTION--THE POLLING BOOTH. BY W.\r\nHOGARTH. 1754.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 145._]\r\n\r\nThe view of the Polling Booth is full of intention. Within, seated at\r\nthe back, on a raised platform, are the sheriffs or bailiffs with whom\r\nthe election rests, and their attendant, the beadle; in the front\r\nare the poll clerks, with their register-books, and the lawyers to see\r\nthe testaments duly offered for attesting the oath; in the left corner,\r\na veteran (the Militia Bill peeps out of his pocket), who has lost\r\nboth arms and one leg, is touching the testament with the iron hook\r\nwhich does duty for his missing hand; the clerk is trying to stifle\r\nhis laughter, while the opposition lawyer is energetically protesting\r\nagainst this proceeding as informal. Hogarth has literally brought “the\r\nblind and the halt” to the hustings; in fact, as was too frequently\r\nwitnessed on these occasions, he has introduced the extremes to which\r\nrecourse was had,--a pitiable idiot, in a hopeless stage of imbecility,\r\nis brought up to the poll in a chair; this poor creature’s mind is\r\ntoo far gone to distinguish between his right and left hands; the\r\nclerk is vainly endeavouring to get the proper attestation, while the\r\nkeeper, or mad doctor, Dr. Shebbeare,[47] whose legs are adorned with\r\nfetters as a felon, is prompting his charge; a political letter of the\r\ndoctor’s is shown in his pocket. Another victim, evidently on the verge\r\nof dissolution, is smuggled up to the booth in an unconscious state,\r\nwrapped in a blanket and carried by two repulsive ruffians; one of them\r\nis puffing a blast of tobacco smoke full in the face of the dying man,\r\nto whose night-cap is pinned a “True Blue” favour.\r\n\r\n    “Swift, reverend wag, Iërne’s pride,\r\n    Who lov’d the comic rein to guide,\r\n    Has told us, ‘Jailors, when they please,\r\n    Let out their flock to rob for fees.’\r\n    From this sage hint, in needful cases,\r\n    The wights, who govern other places,\r\n    Let out their crew for private ends--\r\n    _Ergo_, to serve themselves and friends.\r\n    Behold, here gloriously inclin’d\r\n    The Sick, the Lame, the Halt, and Blind!\r\n    From Workhouse, Jail, and Hospital,\r\n    Submissive come, true Patriots all!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And ’scaped from wars and foreign clutches,\r\n    An Invalid’s behind on crutches.”\r\n\r\nDrinking is still proceeding, and “dying speeches” are hawked about,\r\nwith the usual heading of a rude woodcut of the gallows, in allusion\r\nmost probably to a local occurrence which produced considerable\r\nagitation amongst the public at large--the passions of the multitude\r\nhaving been set into a flame, in the absence of political excitement,\r\nby the trial and execution at Oxford, in 1753, of a young woman, Mary\r\nBlandy, for poisoning her father under rather romantic circumstances;\r\nshe persisted in asserting her innocence, even on the scaffold; a\r\nnumber of pamphlets were published upon her case, which became the\r\nsubject of warm dispute.\r\n\r\nAll these “Election” plates are rich in suggestive allusions, the\r\nmeaning of many of which are now lost. Hogarth in his third plate\r\nhas indulged in simple allegory. Britannia’s state coach is in\r\ndifficulties, to which, by the aid of the check-string fastened to her\r\ncoachman’s arm, she is vainly endeavouring to draw the attention of\r\nher driver, who has laid down his reins, being otherwise engaged; the\r\ntwo servants on the box are absorbed in a game of cards, while one is\r\ncheating,--an allusion to the extravagant gambling propensities which,\r\nto so large and notorious an extent, disfigured society in general, and\r\nparticularly (at this time) those charged with the interests of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OXFORDSHIRE ELECTION.--CHAIRING THE MEMBERS. BY W.\r\nHOGARTH. 1754.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth plate, “Chairing the Members,” exhibits the last and\r\napparently most trying episode as regards the successful candidate; the\r\nhero of the hour--the newly returned member, elected in the True Blue,\r\nor New Interest--occupies a position which may have its honours, but\r\nobviously has its perils. In place of the actually returned members,\r\nHogarth seems to have selected the figure of the intriguing manager of\r\nthe Leicester House party, Bubb Dodington (afterwards Lord Melcombe),\r\nfor the hero of the chairing scene. He is elevated only to find\r\nhimself surrounded with embarrassments: the dangers of his chairing\r\nare lost sight of momentarily, for his pale face is horror-stricken\r\nby being confronted with a fair lady of fashion; she is equally\r\naffected by the rencontre, for she is swooning away--it is presumed\r\nwith apprehension--in the arms of her maids. Over Bubb’s head flies a\r\ngoose--a happy conception, understood to be introduced as a parody of\r\nthe “Triumph of Alexander,” by Le Brun, where that grandiose artist has\r\nsuggestively made an eagle hover over the head of his hero. In the Blue\r\nprocession following the chairmen are all the elements of an election\r\ntriumph--rough music of marrow-bones and cleavers, True Blue flags,[48]\r\nplenty of bludgeon-men, while a “block head,” wearing the buff favour\r\nof their opponents, is carried to ridicule the opposition. Another\r\nhumorous episode is shown in a vixenish dame sporting a buff cockade;\r\nshe has boldly broken through the ranks of the Blues, and is driving\r\nfrom their midst her husband, a tailor, detected in his duplicity by\r\nthe virago, who is soundly cuffing her crestfallen “inferior moiety,”\r\nlately deserted to the enemy. A barrel of beer has been placed in the\r\nstreet for public use; a pewter measure stands beside it; the mob seems\r\nto have used the opportunity, as a would-be drinker is discovering that\r\nthe cask is already emptied. In the distance, a second chaired member\r\nis skilfully indicated, of whom the shadow only is seen, projected\r\non a wall, while he is carried along to the evident risk of limb and\r\nlife, as his gesticulations imply. Among other accessories may be noted\r\na tar-barrel, in preparation for a bonfire later on. The sun-dial\r\nbears the date 1755 (when the picture was completed), and marks three\r\no’clock, the quality dinner-hour. The bigwigs of the Court party\r\nare assembled at an adjacent mansion, at which a plentiful banquet\r\nis about to be served: a French _chef_, his long clubbed tail bound\r\nwith an orange favour, a female cook, noblemen’s servants, and other\r\nretainers, all wearing the colours of the Old Interest, are carrying\r\nthe silver-covered dishes in procession. The ministerial adherents are\r\nassembled on the first floor; a large handsome window--all the panes of\r\nwhich have been broken by the stones of the patriots, affords a good\r\nview of the guests; from the side window they are catching the prospect\r\nof the Blue demonstration, surveying with malicious delight the\r\nperilous situation of the alarmed chaired member, whose triumph seems,\r\nfor the time being, the reverse of enviable.\r\n\r\nIt is said the figure of the chief personage is intended for that\r\nof the Duke of Newcastle; the Duke of Marlborough was also actively\r\nengaged on the Tory side: while the back of another, wearing a broad\r\nribbon, is possibly meant for Lord Winchilsea. Among the artist’s\r\nfugitive sketches, as published at his widow’s, Leicester Fields,\r\nin 1781, are the two caricatures--engraved by Bartolozzi, from the\r\nEarl of Exeter’s collection of Hogarth’s originals--representing Bubb\r\nDodington (very like “Punch”), and the back view of Lord Winchilsea;\r\nboth these studies might have been made for the plate of “Chairing the\r\nMembers.” These figures are also included in a caricature entitled “The\r\nRecruiting Sergeant” 1757 (the design of which was ascribed to the Hon.\r\nGeorge Townshend), while that of Lord Winchilsea, who was at the head\r\nof the admiralty, is reproduced with scarcely any alteration, excepting\r\nthe position of the paddle shown over his shoulder, in the “Triumph of\r\nNeptune.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE BUBB DODINGTON (LORD MELCOMBE-REGIS) AND THE EARL\r\nOF WINCHILSEA. BY HOGARTH. 1753.]\r\n\r\nOther multifarious incidents are given in the fourth plate of the\r\n“Election.” A soldier with the Buff colours is washing the wound\r\nreceived on behalf of his employers; his sword is snapped across the\r\nblade. A pig-driver, flourishing a formidable flail, is doing battle\r\nwith a bear-leader, who is armed with a bludgeon. The backward swing\r\nof the flail is imperilling the security of the new member’s seat,\r\nwhile wounding the chair-bearers. Bruin is helping himself from the\r\noffal pail of a passing ass--the patient animal stopping to munch a\r\nthistle by the wayside; the driver is belabouring the bear over the\r\nhead, to the alarm of a monkey equipped _à la militaire_ and riding on\r\nthe brute’s shoulder. In the monkey’s fright, a musket at his side is\r\ndischarged in the face of a little chimney-sweep, who, raised aloft\r\non the wall, is stooping forward to ornament a sculptured skull or\r\neffigy of death, placed above the church gate, with a pair of huge\r\nround spectacles, in imitation of those worn by Lord Winchilsea. This\r\nburning of powder, like the other episodes, has its significance; for,\r\naccording to the account of Nichols, who claims to have discussed the\r\nhidden meanings of these pictures with Hogarth himself, it was “during\r\nthe contested Oxfordshire Election in 1754 an outrageous mob in the\r\n‘Old Interest’ had surrounded a post-chaise, and were about to throw\r\nit into the river (occupant and all), when Captain T----, withinside,\r\nshot a chimney-sweeper who was most active in the assault. The captain\r\nwas tried and acquitted.” Among the items in these election bills\r\nit will be observed that more or less mortality has generally to be\r\nreckoned, “death by misadventure” having been sufficiently prominent\r\nin most contests of the kind during the turbulent times of the past.\r\nPrivate property was held in small respect while rioting was rife; for\r\ninstance, Hogarth has, in the scene of the chairing, shown a mansion\r\npartially demolished, intending to imply that the house had been\r\nwrecked by the riotous mob in the course of their eccentric diversions:\r\nit will be noted that the wilful destruction of houses and furniture\r\nwas another recognized feature of election times.\r\n\r\nThe diary of George Bubb Dodington, Baron of Melcombe-Regis, does\r\nnot, it is true, contain any enlightenment upon the subject of the\r\nOxfordshire election as depicted by Hogarth, yet the writer is\r\ncircumstantial in his account of the elections of April, 1754. The\r\nrecords, however, deal with other contests in which the diarist was\r\nactive, and notably one which brought Dodington much perplexity of mind\r\nand loss of cash. The accounts are nearly all set down as recitals of\r\nlong interviews with the Duke of Newcastle, who was then trying to\r\nstrengthen his hands by giving away places to those whose allegiance\r\nwas doubtful; while Dodington, upon whose influence and assistance\r\nhe could reckon, reaped nothing but mortification, being in fact an\r\nintriguer who was for once played upon for ends other than his own by\r\na more astute and less scrupulous diplomatist than himself. The heads\r\nof the alliance are set down as under discussion. Bubb was to furnish\r\nhis interest towards the electing the new parliament (the dissolution\r\nwas then an affair of hours), claiming to return six members on his\r\nown account. “I did it,” he writes, “in the county of Dorset, as far\r\nas they pleased to push it. I engaged also specifically to choose two\r\nmembers for Weymouth, which he desired might be the son of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire and Mr. Ellis of the admiralty.” The candidates nominated\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle, Lord J. Cavendish and Mr. Ellis, were\r\nsuccessfully returned by Dodington’s influence in the sequel. Further,\r\nthere was opposition in Bridgwater, where Bubb was expected to return\r\ntwo members. Lord Egmont was putting up for that place against the\r\nCourt, and it was the royal pleasure that Dodington should sacrifice\r\nhimself to keep the Tory candidate out, as signified through Pelham;\r\nto which Bubb replied, “that I desired him, when next these matters\r\ncame to be discussed, to lay me at the King’s feet, and tell him that,\r\nas I found it would be agreeable to his Majesty, I would spare neither\r\npains nor expense to exclude him; and thus it became my engagement to\r\ndo it if I can.” “Lord Egmont’s successful return,” he writes, “need\r\nnot affect my election, though it might destroy the Whig interest in\r\nBridgwater for ever.” Poor Bubb, oblivious of the royal antipathies to\r\nthe friends of the Prince of Wales, was hoping to secure his old post\r\nof treasurer of the navy, but the leadership of the House of Commons\r\nhad fallen upon the Pelhams, and, as the party must be strengthened\r\nthere, it was hinted that the Duke of Newcastle would have to buy\r\nsupporters by giving away to waverers the offices which rightly were\r\ndue to his friends; to which Dodington replied without sophistication,\r\n“that he considered himself as useful there as his neighbours, and,\r\nconsidering his age, rank, the offices he had held,” and, “adding\r\nto that, choosing six members for them at my own expense, without\r\nthe expense of one shilling from their side, I thought the world in\r\ngeneral, and even the gentlemen themselves, could not expect that their\r\npretensions should give me the exclusion.” The duke remarked that “the\r\nease and cheapness of the election of Weymouth had surprised him, that\r\nthey had nothing like it;” and Bubb considered again “that there were\r\nfew who could give his Majesty six members for nothing.” Newcastle then\r\ntook the stout future Baron Melcombe in his arms and kissed him twice\r\n(!) “with strong assurance of affection and service;” moreover, notes\r\nof all Bubb had said were written out for the king’s pleasure. A week\r\nlater, Dodington sets down, “Dined at Lord Barrington’s, and found\r\nthat, notwithstanding the fine conversation of last Thursday, all the\r\nemployments are given away.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he valorously went to work to try and return two members\r\nfor Bridgwater, though rather against his inclinations; unfortunately,\r\nalthough the doings of each day are set down, the details of the\r\nelection have been abbreviated by the editor of the diary, Henry\r\nWyndham.\r\n\r\n    “1754. April 8th. Arrived at Eastbury.\r\n\r\n    “11. Dr. Sharpe and I set out from Eastbury at four o’clock\r\n    in the morning for Bridgwater, where, as I expected, I found\r\n    things very disagreeably framed.\r\n\r\n    “12. Lord Egmont came, with trumpets, noise, etc.\r\n\r\n    “13. He and we walked the town: we found nothing unexpected as\r\n    far as we went.\r\n\r\n    “14, 15, 16. Spent in the infamous and disagreeable compliance\r\n    with the low habits of venal wretches.\r\n\r\n    “17. Came on the election, which I lost by the injustice of the\r\n    Returning Officer. The numbers were--for Lord Egmont 119, for\r\n    Mr. Balch 114, for me 105. Of my good votes 15 were rejected: 8\r\n    bad votes for Lord Egmont were received.\r\n\r\n    “18. Left Bridgwater for ever. Arrived at Eastbury in the\r\n    evening.”\r\n\r\nAltogether Dodington places his expenses at £2500, later on at £3400,\r\nand finally, when the king had thrown him over, at nearly £4000 spent\r\nin this affair. According to an accepted political axiom, what a man\r\nbuys he may sell; Pelham admitted to Dodington that he possessed “a\r\ngood deal of marketable ware (parliamentary interest), and that if I\r\nwould empower him to offer it all to the king, without conditions, he\r\nwould he answerable to bring the affair to a good account.” In this\r\ninstance the vendor sold himself for “just nothing at all,” as is shown\r\nin the diary. The king disliked Bubb as the adviser of his son, whom he\r\nhated.\r\n\r\n    “April 26. I went to the Duke of Newcastle’s. Received with\r\n    much seeming affection: thanks for Weymouth, where I had\r\n    succeeded; sorrow for Bridgwater, where I had not.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “I began by telling him that I had done all that was in the\r\n    power of money and labour, and showed him two bills for money\r\n    remitted thither, before I went down, one of £1000, one of\r\n    £500, besides all the money then in my steward’s hands, so that\r\n    the election would cost me about £2500. In the next place, if\r\n    this election stood, the borough was for ever in Tory hands;\r\n    that all this was occasioned by want of proper support from the\r\n    Court, and from the behaviour of the servants of the Crown.”\r\n\r\nThe truth was that the Court had really defeated Dodington. Lord\r\nPoulett, a lord of the bedchamber, “had acted openly against him with\r\nall his might;” and this action on the part of the higher powers had\r\ncarried the Government employees, so that “five out of the Custom-house\r\nofficers gave single votes for Lord Egmont.”\r\n\r\n    “The next head was--that, in spite of all, I had a fair\r\n    majority of legal votes, for that the Mayor had admitted eight\r\n    bad votes for Lord Egmont, and refused fifteen good ones for\r\n    me; so that it was entirely in their own hands to retrieve\r\n    the borough, and get rid of a troublesome opponent, if they\r\n    pleased; that if the king required this piece of service, it\r\n    was to be done, and the borough put into Whig hands, and under\r\n    his influence, without any stretch of power.”\r\n\r\nThe intricacies of electioneering are supplanted by those of statecraft\r\nfrom this point; Bubb’s diary rehearses--spread over four months--the\r\nreasons for and against petitioning for a just return; but it peeps\r\nout, and therein lies the rub--that Dodington has inflamed the Tories\r\nby his assistance in Dorset. Now, just at this time, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle sought to make friends with the opposition; and it occurred\r\nto this slippery tactician that, as Dodington had had the sole onus of\r\ntrying to keep out the Tories and failed, if he allowed Lord Egmont\r\nto retain his seat for Bridgwater, it would purchase his allegiance\r\nwithout the cost and inconvenience of putting some post or piece of\r\nstate preferment at his disposal. Thus did Dodington sacrifice both his\r\nmoney and pains without conciliating the favour of the king, with whom\r\nthe ambitious courtier was the reverse of popular.\r\n\r\nOne important feature of electioneering, missing in the later days, was\r\nthe edifying practice of “Burning a Prime Minister,” making effigies of\r\nunpopular candidates and obnoxious ministers for burnt-offerings.\r\n\r\nA caricature appeared in 1756 representing a street, in the precincts\r\nof Westminster it is presumed, filled with a crowd of enthusiastic\r\npatriots on their way to make a bonfire of the offending minister\r\nin effigy. The figure wears a cocked hat, and has a wig and mask,\r\nevidently copied from those of the living prototype, mounted on a\r\nstick; the coat and gloves are stuffed; the legs are sticks, bound up\r\ninto a rude resemblance to stockings and shoes. The effigy is strapped\r\non horseback. At the rear is a gibbet, on which the dummy premier is to\r\nbe finally suspended. One of the mob bears a supply of faggots. Beneath\r\nthis pictorial satire, which is executed something in the style of\r\nSayer, the caricaturist of a later date, appear the verses:--\r\n\r\n    “Were you in effigy to burn\r\n    Each treacherous statesman in his turn,\r\n    What better would Britannia be,\r\n    Whilst the proud knaves themselves are free?\r\n    Knaves have brought disgrace upon her!\r\n    Have bought her votes and sold her Honour!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING A PRIME MINISTER IN EFFIGY. 1756. (FROM DR.\r\nNEWTON’S COLLECTION.)]\r\n\r\nThe following manifesto explains the object of this publication, an\r\nappeal “Against Corruption,” and directed to securing the purity of\r\nelections against Ministerial bribery. The subject of the squib was\r\nevidently suggested by the Guy Fawkes processions of November. It\r\nappeared at the time when the Newcastle and Fox administration was near\r\nits fall and after those expensive elections in which the duke had\r\nspent enormous sums in bribery.\r\n\r\n    “Who can call to remembrance without abhorrence the behaviour\r\n    of a Whiggish Ministry, who, neglecting everything else but\r\n    the business of Bribery and Corruption, reduced the credit of\r\n    the Nation and themselves to so low an ebb, that at length\r\n    they were obliged to import Hessian and Hanoverian Troops to\r\n    support an immense unconstitutional standing army, in defending\r\n    them and their measures at home; whilst our perfidious enemies\r\n    ravaged and distressed our wretched Colonies in every other\r\n    part of the globe. Now it would be well for England if the\r\n    several Tory or motley administrations since that time could\r\n    demonstrate that they have spent less time and treasure in\r\n    the same destructive employment. As a tree is known by its\r\n    fruit, so is a bad minister by his attempting to influence\r\n    Electors, or even to gain a Majority of the Elected by any\r\n    other means than the justice of his measures; otherwise the use\r\n    of a national Council is superseded; and when a King is thus\r\n    deprived of the disinterested deliberations of his people in\r\n    Parliament, the authors of the undue influence are certainly\r\n    guilty of Treason in the strictest sense of the word.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJOHN WILKES AS A POPULAR REPRESENTATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the whole history of electioneering no figure is more conspicuous\r\nthan that of John Wilkes, the quondam patriot, who was by the attacks\r\nof others brought into a prominence which neither his abilities nor\r\ncharacter justified.\r\n\r\nHogarth commenced hostilities against Wilkes, Churchill (_The North\r\nBriton_), and Beardmore (_The Monitor_) by attacking their publications\r\nincidentally in that unfortunate attempt at political satire of his,\r\nchristened “The Times,” Plate I. (1762). It will be remembered that\r\nthe figure of the artist’s patron, Lord Bute, is there glorified as a\r\nScotch husbandman engaged in extinguishing a general conflagration;\r\nwhile a frenzied man, intended to personify the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nis driving a wheel-barrow filled with _Monitors_ and _North Britons_\r\nagainst the legs of the zealous Scot, who, unmoved, continues his\r\nexertions to subdue the threatened ruin of the State. Pitt and Lord\r\nTemple are further assailed--not too cleverly--in this view of the\r\n“Times.” On this provocation, Wilkes and Churchill naturally took up\r\nthe cudgels in their own defence, and certainly gave Hogarth cause\r\nfor irritation. He prepared the second plate of “The Times,” with a\r\nfurther pictorial castigation of his now-declared adversaries, but was\r\ninduced to reconsider the policy of publishing the plate, and thus\r\ngiving greater offence; consequently it was not until thirty years\r\nlater, when the quarrel was almost forgotten, and the opponents had\r\nlong been at rest,[49] that the world was favoured with a view of this\r\nequally laboured satire, when it was published by the Boydells at\r\ntheir Shakespeare Gallery, with the collected works of W. Hogarth (May\r\n29, 1790). George III., Bute, Temple, Lord Mansfield, and others, are\r\nintroduced in this version, but the portion which is pointed at Wilkes,\r\nin continuation of this “rough bout of clever men clumsily throwing\r\ndirt at each other,” as it has been described, is the figurement of\r\nMiss Fanny, of “Cock-lane ghost” notoriety, pilloried and held up\r\nto infamy side by side with Wilkes, whose offence is indicated as\r\n“Defamation.” On his breast is pinned a copy of the _North Briton_,\r\nthe No. 17 which was specially devoted to a base attack upon Hogarth.\r\nThis incendiary publication is already threatened with flames from\r\nthe penitential candle held by “Miss Fanny,” his shrouded companion\r\nin disgrace. Indignities are showered upon Wilkes in allusion to his\r\ninvolved circumstances; his empty pockets are turned inside out, a\r\nschool-boy is watering his legs, a woman is trundling a mop over his\r\nhead, and he is generally regarded with derisive contempt by the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe crowning effort of Hogarth’s revenge for the abuse showered upon\r\nhim by both Wilkes and Churchill was the famous etching in which\r\nthe popular favourite is pilloried to all time as the type and very\r\npersonification of everything false and sinister, and yet most lifelike\r\nas to resemblance; for Wilkes was himself so cynically candid as to\r\nadmit in after-life that he was “growing more like his portrait every\r\nday.” The famous likeness represents Wilkes seated in a chair at a low\r\ntable, on which is an inkstand and the _North Briton_, Nos. 17 and 45;\r\nhe is holding the staff, topped with an inverted vessel to simulate\r\nthe cap of liberty. Attitude and features are alike expressive, and,\r\nas Mr. Stephens has described it, “he leers and squints as if in\r\nmockery of his own pretences to patriotism.” When brought up from the\r\nTower, to which Lord Bute’s party had ventured to commit him for the\r\nattack in the _North Briton_, No. 45, Wilkes was tried at Westminster,\r\nbefore Chief Justice Pratt--subsequently eulogized as “the champion of\r\nFreedom and Justice,” and better known to fame as Lord Camden,--who\r\ncaused the prisoner to be discharged, to the frantic delight of the\r\npopulace. It was on this occasion that Hogarth secured his opportunity\r\nof sketching the idol of the people and the thorn of the Court. In a\r\nnote prefixed to “An Epistle to William Hogarth,” by Churchill, it is\r\naverred that when Mr. Wilkes was the second time brought from the Tower\r\nto Westminster Hall, Hogarth skulked behind a screen in the corner of\r\nthe gallery of the Common Pleas; and while Lord Chief Justice Pratt\r\nwas enforcing the great principles of the Constitution, the painter\r\nwas employed in caricaturing the prisoner. So popular was this print,\r\nissued at one shilling, that Nichols mentions “nearly four thousand\r\ncopies were worked off in a few weeks.” “The Epistle” referred to\r\nwas provoked by the etching of John Wilkes, “Drawn from the Life.”\r\nHogarth is said to have felt severely the retort which the vigorous and\r\n“bruising” Churchill thought proper to make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN WILKES, A PATRIOT. AFTER HOGARTH.]\r\n\r\n    “Lurking, most ruffian-like, behind a screen,\r\n    So plac’d all things to see, himself unseen,\r\n    Virtue, with due contempt, saw Hogarth stand,\r\n    The murd’rous pencil in his palsied hand;” etc.\r\n\r\nTo this pasquinade, which revelled audaciously in the realms of libel,\r\nand was otherwise a false and indefensible attack on the artist’s\r\nprivate life, Hogarth characteristically replied with his graver; but\r\nnot to lose time, while his mind was heated by the attack, he utilized\r\na plate on which was already engraved his own portrait and his dog,\r\nafter the painting now in the National Gallery, and burnishing out\r\nthose parts which were in his way, he engraved--\r\n\r\n    “The Bruiser, C. Churchill (once the Revd.!), in the character\r\n    of a Russian Hercules, regaling himself after having kill’d the\r\n    monster Caricatura that so sorely gall’d his virtuous friend,\r\n    the Heaven-born WILKES.\r\n\r\n    “‘But he had a Club this Dragon to drub,\r\n    Or he had ne’er don’t I warrant ye.’”\r\n\r\n  (_Dragon of Wantley._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEAR-LEADER. HOGARTH, CHURCHHILL, AND WILKES.]\r\n\r\nThis plate was issued at 1_s._ _6d._, and seems to have gone through\r\nvarious alterations and additions from first to last. On the palette\r\nwhich first displayed the mystifying “line of beauty,” was substituted\r\ntwo designs of a figurative nature--the one having reference to\r\nPitt, his resignation and annual pension, and his city supporters,\r\nrepresented by the emblematic civic guardians, Gog and Magog; the\r\nother a group further applying to the castigation of the designer’s\r\nfoes. Hogarth is armed with a triple whip, with which he is lustily\r\nchastising a big dancing bear, Churchill, held bound and muzzled, as\r\nnot only the artist but the ministry and the Scotch faction would\r\nhave rejoiced to have effected; the Bruiser to the clerical ruffles\r\nand bands has incongruously added the modish laced hat of a man about\r\ntown; the other end of the rope, by which Hogarth has secured the bear\r\nthrough the muzzle, is fastened round an ape, intended to personify\r\nWilkes. This animal is wearing a wig exactly similar to that shown on\r\nWilkes’s head in the too-famous etching; the _North Briton_ is in his\r\nleft hand; the spear, topped with the inevitable cap of liberty, is\r\nturned into a hobby-horse, to infer, according to Mr. F. G. Stephen’s\r\naccount, “that Wilkes used Liberty to get his own ends, which not more\r\nthan a child progresses on its ‘cock-horse’ did he really obtain.” The\r\nface of the fiddling personage, who is making the music for this pretty\r\ncaper, is a featureless blank; he wears a ribbon of knighthood, and it\r\nis understood that Earl Temple is the person intended.\r\n\r\nOther uncomplimentary allusions to Wilkes and his proceedings appear\r\nin the _Public Advertiser_, where is a woodcut of an execution, I.W.,\r\nand M.P., with a “Toast”--“May loyalists walk easily in their Boots\r\n[a reference to Lord Bute], and malcontents die like Wilks in their\r\nshells.”\r\n\r\nThe notoriety of John Wilkes was much assisted by the ill-advised and\r\nclumsy conduct of the ministry, which elected to make a martyr of the\r\nman whose career proves him to have been but a sham patriot, and, who,\r\nif unnoticed, was totally without weight or consequence. On April 30,\r\n1763, Wilkes found himself, in spite of the Habeas Corpus granted by\r\nthe Common Pleas, conducted to the Tower on a warrant, signed by the\r\nEarls of Egremont and Halifax as Privy Councillors and Secretaries of\r\nState, authorizing the Constable of the Tower, the Right Hon. John Lord\r\nBerkeley of Stratton,--\r\n\r\n    “to receive into your custody the body of John Wilkes, Esq.,\r\n    herewith sent you, for being the author and publisher of a most\r\n    infamous and seditious libel, entitled the _North Briton_,\r\n    No. XLV., tending to inflame the minds and alienate the\r\n    affections of the people from His Majesty, and to excite them\r\n    to traitorous insurrections against the Government.”\r\n\r\nThe small engraving which exhibits Wilkes in the Tower, forms one\r\nportion of a series, entitled “The Places” (being a sequel to “The\r\nPosts”), a political pasquinade, dedicated to Bamber Gasoign, Esq., a\r\nTrading Lord for the time being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SAFE PLACE. WILKES IN THE TOWER, 1763.]\r\n\r\n    “Satire’s a harmless, quiet thing--\r\n    ’Tis application makes the sting.”\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is styled a Safe Place; the title is “Moderation, Moderation,\r\nthis was Wonderful Moderation, an old song.” The prisoner is\r\nsimultaneously attacked by curs, and by one of the historical lions\r\nof the Tower, which cannot do much harm, being chained to the secure\r\npost Magna Charta. Wilkes is threatening his assailants with a whip;\r\nhe has on a spear the cap of liberty--this emblem is inscribed “Habeas\r\nCorpus.” A yeoman of the guard is in charge of the hero of the XLV.\r\n_North Briton_.\r\n\r\n    “There’s a scene for an Englishman! Patriots ill-us’d,\r\n    Magna Charta despised, and poor Freedom abus’d;\r\n    Once the love of our country brought profit and pow’r,\r\n    But it now, tho’ with glory, sends WILKES to the Tow’r.”\r\n\r\nIn the version of “Daniel cast into the Den of Lions; or, _True\r\nBlue_ will never stain” (April 29, 1763), Wilkes is shown the centre\r\nof a highly elaborate allegorical combination, which deals with\r\nthe incidents of his arrest, associated with the _North Briton_,\r\nand his obnoxious writings. One of the scenes exhibits the king’s\r\nmessengers violently breaking into Wilkes’s house, Great George Street,\r\nWestminster, and ransacking his receptacles for papers. On the other\r\nside, the messengers are shown conducting Wilkes to the Tower, the\r\ntitle “Den of Lions” not being wide of the mark, since it, at that\r\ntime, was the abiding place of the royal menagerie. Wilkes is made to\r\ndeclare: “Corruption I detest, and Persecution I despise,”--sentiments\r\nbefitting the patriotic martyr, as he was then believed to be, a\r\n“goodly repute” with which he was only too desirous of parting in\r\nexchange for such bribes as were weighty enough for his acceptance.\r\nIn the symbolic view of this new “Daniel,” the goddess Fame hovers\r\nover her whilom favourite, with a wreath to crown his brow; she is\r\npublishing, through her trumpet, “Magnus est Veritas;” the door of the\r\nden which confines the lions is a prominent feature. Below appears\r\nthe Lieutenant of the Tower; he has a written “counsel’s opinion” in\r\nhis hand, and is replying to a demand for admittance made by Wilkes’s\r\nbrother, “Consider, sir, my Lord Temple was not suffered to see him.”\r\nWhen Wilkes was committed to the Tower, both his brother and Earl\r\nTemple applied to be admitted to see him, and were refused.\r\n\r\nThe “general warrant” on which Wilkes was arrested was proved illegal,\r\nand on a writ of _Habeas Corpus_, he was set at liberty on the ground\r\nof his privilege as a member of Parliament. After his release from\r\nthe Tower, Wilkes was involved in a duel, and severely wounded; he\r\nthen fled to Paris, January, 1764, and was, in his absence, expelled\r\nfrom parliament and outlawed for contempt of court. On the issue of\r\nwrits for the general election, after the dissolution of parliament,\r\nMarch 12, 1768, Wilkes, who had made several vain attempts to get\r\nthe sentence reversed, suddenly presented himself as a candidate to\r\nrepresent the city of London, in the interval addressing to the king\r\na submissive letter imploring pardon and the reversal of the sentence\r\nof outlawry which had been passed upon him. This petition the king\r\nrejected with decision. Although Alderman Sir William Baker was the\r\nonly citizen of note or influence who supported him, Wilkes persisted\r\nin his candidature, the lower people embracing his cause with ardour;\r\nbut he polled the minimum of votes, and was signally defeated, the\r\nsuccessful members being the Hon. Thomas Harley, lord mayor, with\r\n3,729 votes; Sir R. Ladbroke, 3,678; William Beckford, 3,402; Barlow\r\nTrecothwick, 2,957. The unsuccessful candidates were Sir Richard Glyn,\r\n2,823; John Patterson, 1,769; and Wilkes, at the bottom of the poll,\r\nwho contrived to secure 1,247 votes.\r\n\r\nOn Wilkes’s return from the Guildhall at the close of the poll, March\r\n23, 1768, where, as seen, he obtained the lowest number of votes, the\r\npeople displayed their fervour for spurious patriotism by removing\r\nthe horses from his carriage, and drawing it themselves; other\r\nextravagancies of a like nature showed the spirit of the multitude,\r\nby whom Wilkes was regarded as the tribune of the people, a situation\r\nvery much to his taste. Considering his mob-popularity assured, he now\r\nproposed to conciliate his opponents; the first step was to make a\r\npretence of submission. On the 22nd of March, he wrote to the solicitor\r\nof the treasury: “I take the liberty of acquainting you, that in the\r\nbeginning of the ensuing term I shall present myself to the court of\r\nKing’s Bench. I pledge my honour as a gentleman, that on the very\r\nfirst day I will there make my personal appearance.” The letter sent\r\nby Wilkes to the king was certainly a plausible composition, but the\r\nfervid assurances there given being in direct antagonism with the\r\nconduct of the writer at that very time, it may be held that George\r\nIII. was justified in treating the applicant with indignant contempt.\r\n\r\n    “SIRE,\r\n\r\n    “I beg thus to throw myself at your Majesty’s feet, and\r\n    supplicate the mercy and clemency which shine with such lustre\r\n    among your princely virtues. Some former ministers, whom your\r\n    Majesty, in condescension to the wishes of your people, thought\r\n    proper to remove, employed every wicked and deceitful act to\r\n    oppress your subject, and to avenge their own personal cause on\r\n    him, whom they imagined to be the principal author of bringing\r\n    to public view their ignorance, insufficiency, and treachery to\r\n    your Majesty and the nation.\r\n\r\n    “I have been the innocent and unhappy victim of revenge. I was\r\n    forced by their injustice and violence into exile, which I have\r\n    never ceased to consider, for many years, as the most cruel\r\n    oppression; because I could not longer be under the benign\r\n    influence of your Majesty in this land of liberty.\r\n\r\n    “With a heart full of zeal for the service of your Majesty and\r\n    my country, I implore, Sire, your clemency. My only hopes of\r\n    pardon are founded in the great goodness and benevolence of\r\n    your Majesty; and every day of freedom you may be graciously\r\n    pleased to permit me the enjoyment of, in my dear native land,\r\n    shall give proofs of my zeal and attachment to your service.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was judiciously ignored, but meanwhile fresh publicity was\r\nawaiting Wilkes--on the 27th, he was carried by a writ of _capias ut\r\nlegatum_ to the King’s Bench.\r\n\r\nThe return of Wilkes from Paris, his failure for the city, and election\r\nfor Middlesex are figuratively shadowed forth in “The Flight of\r\nLiberty,” a broadside consisting of two engraved designs, “The Return\r\nof Liberty,” and “Liberty Revived,” with verses in praise of Wilkes and\r\nreflecting adversely upon his antagonists. In the upper compartment\r\nis shown the Court, or administrative faction, destroying the Temple\r\nof Liberty (an allusion to Earl Temple), raised above the statue of\r\nWilkes, with the cap of liberty, as usual, elevated on the staff of\r\nmaintenance. Lord Bute trampling on Magna Charta, is foremost of the\r\ndestroyers who are wrecking the whole edifice, the very foundations\r\nof which are being razed; the “Laird of Boot” is exclaiming, “Well\r\nsaid, guid friends, down with the mighty _Temple_,” in allusion to the\r\nprotection and patronage that nobleman had already extended to Wilkes;\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, Lord North, and other ministers are aiding. The\r\nsecond design shows “the Temple of Liberty built by John Wilkes,\r\nA.D. 1762,” reinstated, “never to fall again.”\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by his defeat for the city of London, Wilkes at once\r\noffered himself for the county of Middlesex. In his “Memoirs of the\r\nReign of George III.,” Walpole gives certain glimpses of the election\r\nproceedings, which are as descriptive as a more detailed account:--\r\n\r\n    “On the 23rd of March the Election began at Brentford; and\r\n    while the irresolution of the Court and the carelessness of the\r\n    Prime Minister, Grafton, caused a neglect of all precautions,\r\n    the zeal of the populace had heated itself to a pitch of fury.”\r\n\r\nThe other candidates were Sir W. Beauchamp Proctor and Mr. Cooke, the\r\nformer members. Cooke, who had sat from 1750, was confined with the\r\ngout; a relation, who appeared for him, was roughly handled. Amidst the\r\nwrecking of carriages which ensued, that of Proctor did not escape the\r\nattention of the roughs; it “was demolished by the mob.”\r\n\r\nThe coach-glasses of such as did not huzza for “Wilkes” and “Liberty”\r\nwere broken, the paint and varnish of chariots and coaches, met and\r\nstopped for miles round, were spoiled by the mob--scratching them\r\nwith the favourite “45.” Lord Bute, generally the object of popular\r\ndisfavour, was denounced by an attack made on his residence, where the\r\nmob broke his windows, as usual, but failed to effect an entrance; the\r\nsame unwelcome attention was paid to Lord Egremont’s, in Pall Mall, as\r\nthe chief signatory to the warrant for Wilkes’s committal. The Duke of\r\nNorthumberland had the honour of appearing, whether he would or no, of\r\nbeing forced to supply the mob with liquor, and to drink with them to\r\nWilkes’s success. The demonstration assumed formidable proportions;\r\nall the windows from West to East were illuminated to please the mob,\r\notherwise they were broken by the riotous “true loyal Britons and\r\nfriends of Liberty,” who performed some curious feats; some of the\r\nregimental drummers, not the Scotch regiments it may be premised,\r\nbeating their drums for Wilkes. This astute diplomatist, finding his\r\nelection secure, very prudently dismissed his enthusiastic partisans,\r\nsuch as the weavers, back to town, the polling[50] was ended, and by\r\nthe next morning quietude was resumed in the vicinity of Brentford.\r\nSome of the incidents were particularly ludicrous, the mob going out of\r\nthe way to perpetuate the number of the _North Briton_ so objectionable\r\nto the Court. The Austrian Ambassador, the Count de Seilern, described\r\nby Horace Walpole in a letter to the Earl of Hertford as the most\r\nstately and ceremonious of men, was obliged to get out of his coach,\r\nand ignominiously held with his legs in the air while the figures “45”\r\nwere chalked on the soles of his shoes. This insult formed the grounds\r\nof an official complaint. It was as difficult for the minister to help\r\nlaughing at the gravity of his representations as to redress the slight\r\noffered to a friendly power in the person of its representative.\r\n\r\nWilkes was now master of the situation; all his expectations were\r\nverified. Elated with success, his audacity enabled him to make the\r\nmost of his undeserved triumph, and assuming a tone which heaped\r\nfresh mortifications upon the Court, he printed an address of\r\nacknowledgment to his constituents, in which he invited them to give\r\nhim their instructions from time to time, and promised that he would\r\nalways defend their civic and religious rights. Although posing as\r\nthe champion of liberty, Wilkes’s parliamentary career was a dismal\r\nfailure; in the House he was of no account whatever.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note contemporaneous opinion on a point which is\r\nso strongly distorted by partisanship that independent impressions\r\nare rare. Dr. Franklin, whose genuine passion for liberty it must be\r\nadmitted was as absorbing and unaffected as Wilkes’s assumed patriotism\r\nwas shallow and self-serving, happened to be in London at the time\r\nof the violent ferment occasioned by the Middlesex election in 1768.\r\nAlthough lately returned from Paris, and himself, a citizen of the\r\nland which complimented Paine, he thus unreservedly sums up the popular\r\ncandidate, together with the political agitation associated with his\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis really an extraordinary event to see an outlaw and\r\n    exile of bad personal character, not worth a farthing, come\r\n    over from France, set himself up as a candidate for the\r\n    capital of the kingdom, miss his election only by being too\r\n    late in his application, and immediately carrying it for the\r\n    principal county. The mob, spirited up by numbers of different\r\n    ballads, sung or roared in the streets, requiring gentlemen\r\n    and ladies of all ranks as they passed in their carriages,\r\n    to shout for ‘Wilkes and Liberty;’ marking the same words on\r\n    their coaches with chalk, and ‘No. 45’ on every door, which\r\n    extend a vast way along the roads into the country. I went\r\n    last week to Winchester, and observed that for fifteen miles\r\n    out of town there was scarcely a door or window-shutter next\r\n    the road unmarked, and this continued here and there quite to\r\n    Winchester, which is sixty-four miles.”\r\n\r\nThe day of Wilkes’s election appeared the portrait of “John Wilkes,\r\nelected Knight of the Shire for Middlesex, March 28, 1768, by the free\r\nvoice of the people,” with, according to the allegorical taste of the\r\ntime, Hercules and Minerva as supporters, the latter crowning the elect\r\nM.P. with a wreath, while the former tramples upon the serpent of Envy;\r\nthe genius of Liberty is holding the staff of maintenance, surmounted\r\nby the cap of liberty (as invariably associated with Wilkes), and is\r\npointing to the portrait as her champion. Simultaneously appeared\r\nan engraving commemorative of other incidents of the return from\r\nBrentford, showing the valour of the chief magistrate of the city. The\r\nguards on duty at St. James’s Palace had orders to be in readiness to\r\nmarch at beat of drum to suppress any riots which might take place; it\r\nhas been described how certain drummers took to drumming for Wilkes,\r\nwhile his sympathizers marched through Westminster to the city,\r\nupsetting all in their way, chalking doors, breaking window-glass,\r\nboth in houses and carriages, inscribing vehicles and foot-passengers\r\nimpartially with “45.” “Wilkes and Liberty” was the cry, and woe to\r\nthose who did not join in shouting, for they, without further inquiry,\r\nwere promptly knocked down. In the city, the mob grew more outrageous,\r\nthe lord mayor being the Hon. Thomas Harley, who had been elected for\r\nthe city, at the top of the poll, when Wilkes, his name lowest on the\r\nlist, had been defeated ignominiously; moreover, the lord mayor was a\r\ncourtier, and was denounced subsequently in the _North Briton_ as “a\r\npolitical gambler,” nor was the charge groundless. The mob accordingly\r\nattacked the Mansion House and the lord mayor’s private residence\r\nin Aldersgate Street; neither of these places being illuminated in\r\nhonour of Wilkes was a sufficient offence in the sight of the mob, who\r\nproceeded to demolish the windows: every pane of glass was broken,\r\neven to those of the lady mayoress’s bed-chamber. Then they erected\r\na gallows, on which was suspended a boot and petticoat to symbolize\r\nthe Princess of Wales, only too well-known, according to popular\r\nclamour, in association with the Earl of Bute, the “Laird of the Boot”\r\nthus indicated in close proximity; these suggestive emblems of hated\r\n“secret influence” were also marked “45” for the nonce. The pictorial\r\nsatire evoked on this topic, “The Rape of the Petticoat” (March 28,\r\n1768), exhibits the lord mayor making a sally from the Mansion House,\r\nsupported by constables armed with long staves; the chief magistrate\r\nhas himself seized the obnoxious boot and petticoat, amid the ridicule\r\nand laughing resistance of the rabble, who are treating his lordship\r\nto indignities. Below the design is inscribed, “He valiantly seiz’d\r\nthe Petticoat and Boot at the portal of his own Mansion.--_Daily\r\nAdvertiser._”\r\n\r\nThis loyal zeal was rewarded with signal favour. Harley was made a\r\ncouncillor of State, and subsequently, through Lord Suffolk, obtained\r\na lucrative contract. To the impression of this print in the _Oxford\r\nMagazine_ the following verses were added:--\r\n\r\n    “Sing thou, my muse, the dire contested fray,\r\n    Where Harley dar’d the dangers of the day;\r\n    Propitious Day, that could at once create\r\n    A Merchant Tailor[51] Councillor of State!\r\n    A numerous multitude contriv’d to meet;\r\n    And Halloo _Forty-Five_ thro’ every street;\r\n    And (what’s incredible) were heard to cry\r\n    Those words seditious, _Wilkes and Liberty_!\r\n    On lofty standards in the air did float\r\n    Those hieroglyphics ‘_Boot_ and _Petticoat_.’\r\n    Soon as their dreadful shouts accost the ear\r\n    Of grocer knights, and traders in small-beer,\r\n    Confounded and amaz’d the Guildhall court\r\n    Forget their custard, and forsake their port;\r\n    Away, with ghastly looks, lo, Harley ran,\r\n    And thus, in doleful plight, their dismal tale began:\r\n    ‘Most honour’d, most belov’d, thou best of men!’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then from his mansion rush’d the val’rous chief,\r\n    To serve his country, or to--take a thief:\r\n    But more resolv’d to crush Rebellion’s root,\r\n    And triumph o’er the Petticoat and Boot;\r\n    In equal balance hung the fierce dispute\r\n    Between the warlike Magistrate and Boot.\r\n    The Boot and Petticoat at length gave way,\r\n    And now remain the trophies of the day.”\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April, Wilkes appeared before the Court of King’s\r\nBench, Westminster, of which event an engraving was published. On his\r\nsurrendering to his outlawry, the Attorney-General moved for Wilkes’s\r\ncommitment, but the judges refused to grant an order to that effect,\r\non the ground that he was not legally before the court; Wilkes then\r\nleft, accompanied by the plaudits of the spectators. “The Scot’s\r\nTriumph; or, a Peep behind the Curtain” gives a further illustration of\r\nthis subject; this print, and another following, are announced in the\r\n_Public Advertiser_:--\r\n\r\n    “To Connoisseurs.--This day is published a satirical scratch\r\n    in the style of Rembrandt, entitled The Scotch Triumph; with\r\n    the representation of their amazing exploits in St. George’s\r\n    Fields; the murder of the innocent, and the sacrifice of\r\n    Liberty, by Molock; with some curious anecdotes.”\r\n\r\nIn the first version, Wilkes and his friends are driving to surrender\r\nin state; their coach is about to crush a Scotch thistle by the way;\r\nthe mob have taken the horses from the vehicle and are dragging it\r\nthemselves on the road to the Bench; Wilkes is thus addressing his\r\nvociferous supporters--“Gentlemen and Friends, let me beg you to\r\ndesist; I’m willing to submit to the laws of my country.”\r\n\r\nAll the leading political personages are introduced as spectators.\r\nLord Holland, an alleged adviser of Lord Bute, is observing, “We have\r\ngot him safe in a trap at last.” “Jemmy Twitcher” (Lord Sandwich) is\r\nresponding, “Yes, but I much doubt whether we shall be able to keep him\r\nthere.” On the 27th of April, Wilkes again came up for judgment, and\r\nwas then committed to the King’s Bench Prison. On his way thither, in\r\nthe custody of two tipstaffs of Lord Mansfield, the coach was stopped\r\nby the people, a further popular demonstration was made, the horses\r\nwere removed, and the vehicle drawn through the city by an enthusiastic\r\ncrowd, the marshal’s deputies being invited to get out. He finally was\r\nescorted to a public-house, the Three Tuns Tavern, in Spitalfields\r\n(or Cornhill, according to Walpole’s account); from thence, after the\r\ndeparture of his demonstrative admirers, Wilkes judged it prudent\r\nto make his escape, and surrender himself again, this time at the\r\nprison gates and to the marshal of the King’s Bench. When the news\r\nof his incarceration reached the mob there was a fresh uproar; the\r\nday following, the prison was surrounded, the palings enclosing the\r\nfootpath were torn up and made into a bonfire, and the inhabitants of\r\nSouthwark found themselves under the necessity, either of illuminating\r\ntheir houses, or of taking the consequences; the mob dispersed on the\r\narrival of a small guard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sergeant Glynn was arguing before all the judges of the Court\r\nof King’s Bench respecting the errors of Wilkes’s outlawry; while,\r\nfrom his place of confinement, Wilkes next proceeded to address his\r\nsympathizing constituents:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO THE GENTLEMEN, CLERGY, AND FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX.\r\n\r\n    “GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n    “In support of the liberties of this country against the\r\n    arbitrary rule of ministers, I was before committed to the\r\n    Tower, and am now sentenced to this prison. Steadiness,\r\n    with, I hope, strength of mind, do not however leave me;\r\n    for the same consolation follows me here, the consciousness\r\n    of innocence, of having done my duty, and exerted all my\r\n    abilities, not unsuccessfully, for this nation. I can submit\r\n    even to far greater sufferings with cheerfulness, because I\r\n    see that my countrymen reap the happy fruits of my labours\r\n    and persecutions, by the repeated decisions of our Sovereign\r\n    courts of justice in favour of liberty. I therefore bear up\r\n    with fortitude, and even glory, that I am called to suffer in\r\n    this cause, because I continue to find the noblest reward,\r\n    the applause of my native country, of this great, free, and\r\n    spirited people.\r\n\r\n    “I chiefly regret, gentlemen, that this confinement deprives\r\n    me of the honour of thanking you in person, according to my\r\n    promise; and at present takes from me, in a great degree, the\r\n    power of being useful to you. The will, however, to do every\r\n    service to my constituents remains in its full force; and when\r\n    my sufferings have a period, the first day I regain my liberty\r\n    shall restore a life of zeal in the cause and interests of the\r\n    county of Middlesex.\r\n\r\n    “In this prison, in any other, in every place, my ruling\r\n    passion will be the love of England and our free constitution.\r\n    For those objects I will make every sacrifice. Under all the\r\n    oppressions which ministerial rage and revenge can invent, my\r\n    steady purpose is to concert with you, and other true friends\r\n    of the country, the most probable means of rooting out the\r\n    remains of arbitrary power and Star-chamber inquisition, and of\r\n    improving as well as securing the generous plans of freedom,\r\n    which were the boast of our ancestors, and I trust will remain\r\n    the noblest inheritance of our posterity, the only genuine\r\n    characteristic of Englishmen.\r\n\r\n  “JOHN WILKES.\r\n\r\n    “_King’s Bench Prison, May 5th, 1768._”\r\n\r\nBy this letter it will be seen that Wilkes chiefly appealed to what is\r\nbest described as clap-trap sensationalism; he continued, however,\r\nto be the cause of constant apprehension, the military and other\r\nauthorities taking every precaution to preserve the peace of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nWhile Wilkes was kept a prisoner in the King’s Bench, the authorities\r\nmade demonstrations of resorting to armed force for the ostensible\r\npurpose of preserving the peace of the metropolis, and, taught\r\nprecaution by the famous “45” demonstration which followed Wilkes’s\r\nelection for Middlesex, to check further rioting with firmness, which\r\nunfortunately degenerated into ferocity.\r\n\r\nParliament met on the 10th of May, Lord Camden being now lord\r\nchancellor. It seems the misconception had arisen that Wilkes’s\r\noutlawry would be reversed, and that in any case he would be suffered\r\nto attend the assembling of parliament. With the design of conveying\r\nhim thither in triumph, a great body of people were gathered at the\r\nKing’s Bench. Finding their expectations disappointed of seeing the\r\nidol of the hour set at large and reinstated as “the tribune of the\r\npeople,” they demanded him at the prison, and grew very tumultuous;\r\nwhereupon the Riot Act was read by two justices of Surrey, but the\r\nmob threw stones and brickbats while it was reading, when one of the\r\nspectators, seeing other persons run, ran too, but was unhappily\r\nsingled out by a picket of the Scotch Guards, who broke their ranks--a\r\nbreach of military discipline--and followed him about five hundred\r\nyards into a cowhouse, and there shot him dead. “Soon after this, the\r\ncrowd increasing, an additional number of the Guards was sent for, who\r\nmarched thither, and also a party of horse grenadiers (two regiments\r\nhad, it appears, been under arms in St. George’s Fields throughout the\r\ndisturbances), when, the riot continuing, the mob were fired on by the\r\nsoldiers, and five or six were killed on the spot, and about fifteen\r\nwounded, among them being two women, one of whom subsequently died of\r\nher wounds. She was, it appears, trying to move her oranges out of\r\ndanger. Another account says (_Gentleman’s Magazine_) several of the\r\npeople killed were passing along the road at a distance; and, later\r\non, it is said not one of the persons actually concerned in the rioting\r\nwere hurt by the firing. Several versions of the fatal affair appeared\r\nimmediately. The case of the inoffensive youth who was thus barbarously\r\nslaughtered excited general sympathy; his name was William Allen, and\r\nhis father was master of the Horseshoe Inn and Livery Stables, Blackman\r\nStreet, Southwark. On the Scotch faction was heaped all the opprobrium\r\nof this regretable transaction.”\r\n\r\nAmong others, appeared the illustration of “The Scotch Victory,” 1768;\r\non the wall of the outhouse, to which the lad had fled for shelter\r\nwhen pursued, is “’45,” an allusion to the cruelties of the Highland\r\nraid in 1745, as well as to the “XLV. North Briton.” Alexander Murray,\r\nthe officer, Donald Maclury, a corporal, and MacLaughlin, a grenadier,\r\nare shown in the act of assassinating Allen. A halter which lies near\r\nthe feet of the soldiers and a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging\r\nindicate the public sentiments on the matter. The letterpress is to\r\nthis effect:--\r\n\r\n    “The monumental inscription on a tombstone erected over the\r\n    grave of Mr. William Allen, junior, in the churchyard of St.\r\n    Mary Newington, Surrey. ‘Sacred to the memory of William Allen,\r\n    an Englishman of unspotted life and amiable disposition, who\r\n    was inhumanly _murdered_ near St. George’s Fields, the 10th day\r\n    of May, 1768, by Scottish detachments from the army.’\r\n\r\n    “’Twas Grafton plann’d the horrors of that day;\r\n      ’Twas Weymouth urg’d th’ enforcing his commands;\r\n    ’Twas Barrington that gave th’ exciting pay,\r\n      The price of blood flow’d through his guilty hands.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Grafton was first lord of the treasury. Viscount Weymouth,\r\nafterwards Marquis of Bath, was one of the secretaries of state; he\r\nhad urged the advisability of calling out military aid to strengthen\r\nthe civil authority. Viscount Barrington was secretary at war. He had\r\nthought proper to convey to the field-officer in command of the Foot\r\nGuards the royal approval of the men’s behaviour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WILKES AND LIBERTY” RIOTS. THE SCOTCH VICTORY. MURDER\r\nOF ALLEN BY A GRENADIER. MASSACRE OF ST. GEORGE’S FIELDS. 1768.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 174._]\r\n\r\n    He begged “that they may be assured that every possible\r\n    regard shall be shown to them in return for their zeal and\r\n    good conduct on this occasion,” “and in case any disagreeable\r\n    circumstance should happen in the execution of their duty,\r\n    they shall have every defence and protection that the law\r\n    authorities, and this Office (the War) can give.”\r\n\r\nJustice Gillam, who was the first to give the order to the third\r\nregiment of Guards to fire on the people, was tried for the murder of\r\nRedburn, a weaver; the judges acquitted him of all responsibility,\r\nand complimented him on the humane manner in which he had exercised\r\nhis authority. Sergeant Glynn, Wilkes’s friend and adviser, was for\r\nthe prosecution. In the course of the evidence it appeared that there\r\nhad been assembled in St. George’s Fields a disorderly concourse,\r\nwhere, after shouting “_Wilkes and Liberty_,” they made an attack on\r\nthe King’s Bench Prison, threw stones into the marshal’s house, and\r\nat length burst open the outward gate of the prison, to the terror of\r\nthe keepers, who not only feared for the security of their prisoners,\r\nbut imagined their own lives were endangered; notwithstanding their\r\napprehensions, the keepers guarded the inner gates from the mob, so\r\nthat the rioters dispersed without effecting their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe marshal, anticipating another attack the day following, applied\r\nto the magistrates for assistance, as shown in the foregoing. On the\r\n10th of May, a larger mob assembled, repeating the cry of “Wilkes and\r\nLiberty;” whereupon the magistrates began to expostulate with them. The\r\nRiot Act was then read, and its intentions endeavoured to be explained.\r\nThe rabble hissed and hooted the soldiers, who endeavoured to scatter\r\nthem. At last, a stone struck Justice Gillam, and he ordered the\r\nfiring, though, as far as could be proved, there existed no absolute\r\nnecessity for this extreme measure. Gillam, who was exhibited to\r\nridicule as “Midas, the Surrey justice,” appears to have been most\r\nunpopular, if not altogether unfit for the responsible position in\r\nwhich he was placed; “the note sent to a bookseller by a magistrate” is\r\nattributed to this hero: “Sir, Send me the ax Re Latin to a Gustus of\r\nPease.” On his trial, James Derbyshire, a bookseller, deposed that Mr.\r\nGillam said publicly in the hearing of the soldiers, “_that his orders\r\nfrom the ministry were, that some men must be killed, and that it were\r\nbetter to kill five and twenty to-day than one hundred to-morrow_.”\r\nAccording to the Rev. John Horne (afterwards Tooke, and known to fame\r\nas the “Brentford Parson”), who was present at the riot, it was he who\r\nprocured the warrant for the arrest of the soldiers. The trial did not\r\ntake place until the 9th of August. Witnesses appeared against Donald\r\nMaclury, who was charged with firing the fatal shot; it was Maclury\r\n(or M’Laury) who said “Damn him, that’s him, shoot him.” Mr. Allen’s\r\nostler declared that when Allen fell, after the prisoner had fired,\r\nMaclury said, “Damn it, it is a good shot.” On his way to gaol, the day\r\nafter the murder, it was proved Maclury acknowledged “that what they\r\nhad done was in consequence of orders, and he hoped they should obtain\r\nmercy.” The defence was that MacLaughlin, a grenadier, acknowledged to\r\nMr. Gillam and six soldiers that it was he who shot Allen, and _that\r\nhis piece went off by accident_. He had since deserted, and, it was\r\nopenly stated in the papers, received one shilling a day to keep out\r\nof the way. The verdict was “not guilty;” and it was admitted that, in\r\norder to save the life of the soldier, who was liable for murder, it\r\nhad “been found necessary to suffer the prosecutors to persist in their\r\nmistake in apprehending and impeaching an innocent man, and in the mean\r\ntime giving the grenadier who actually fired the gun an opportunity\r\nto escape.” Both soldiers were charged at the King’s Bench, when, by\r\narrangement, the guilty man was admitted to bail, to be smuggled out of\r\nharm’s way; “the other was remanded back to prison as the person who\r\nactually shot the lad,” according to the proceedings, May 16, 1768.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the “Scotch Victory,” with the rebus of the\r\njack-boot standing under a petticoat, and enclosed by Scotch thistles,\r\nforms part of a mock dedication: “To the Earl of (Bute), Protector of\r\nour Liberties, this plate is humbly inscribed by F. Junius Brutus.”\r\n\r\n“The Operation,” a frontispiece to the _Political Register_ for June,\r\n1768, shows Lord Bute stabbing Britannia with a dagger, while the\r\nministers already mentioned in association with the death of Allen are\r\ncatching the blood which flows from her wounds:--\r\n\r\n    “The Blood of Vitals from her wounds he drew,\r\n    And fed the Hounds that help’d him to pursue.”\r\n\r\n  (DRYDEN.)\r\n\r\nThe _Oxford Magazine_ for 1769 gives an engraving of the monument\r\nfinally erected over the grave of Mr. Allen, junior. It represents\r\nan altar tomb enclosed by iron rails: on one side is introduced\r\nthe reprobated Scotch thistle, with the legend, “Murder screen’d\r\nand rewarded;” on the other side is shown a Scotch soldier of the\r\nthird regiment of Foot Guards, evidently intended for the murderous\r\nMacLaughlin, approaching and pointing to the inscription on the tomb,\r\nexclaiming, “I have obtain’d a pension of a shilling a day, only for\r\nputting an end to thy days!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMIDDLESEX ELECTIONS, 1768-9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a month of his return died George Cooke, the Tory colleague\r\nof Wilkes in the representation of Middlesex, who had sat from 1750;\r\nhe was prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the joint\r\npaymasters of the forces, and colonel of the Middlesex Militia.\r\nConsequent on his decease a seat for the county was to be contested\r\nin December, 1768, and the public were indulged with another exciting\r\nstruggle at the Brentford hustings. The candidates were John Glynn, the\r\nfriend and advocate of Wilkes, and Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, the\r\ncandidate defeated in the previous election. The superheated state of\r\npopular feeling had not had time to cool down; moreover, Wilkes, the\r\nchosen of the electors, was a prisoner. Both parties on this occasion\r\nseem to have resorted to terrorism; mutual recriminations as to the\r\nhiring of ruffians and bludgeon-men were made during the inquiries into\r\nthe disturbances which ensued. A view of the situation, “Scene at the\r\nBrentford Hustings,” 1768, exhibits the violent and brutal behaviour\r\nof mercenaries in the pay of Proctor’s faction--chiefly reckless\r\nbullies, according to the engraving of the Brentford election. Females\r\nare beaten causelessly; a fruit-stall is wrecked, and a respectably\r\nattired person is taking advantage of the confusion to help himself\r\nfrom the stock, whilst the proprietress is wantonly beaten with a\r\nheavy cudgel; the legion of bludgeons is enlisted in the cause\r\nof “Liberty and Proctor;” a hero whose head is shaven, and who is\r\nevidently a professional pugilist of the Figg and Broughton type, is\r\nmade to exclaim, “For a guinea a day; damn Glynn and all his friends.”\r\nOther beaters--chairmen, linkmen, and the like--are driving all before\r\nthem, and carrying the hustings by assault, demanding, “Bring down\r\nthe poll-book--Proctor shall be the man.” The scattered remnants of\r\na rival mob are retiring; one of these is exclaiming, “D---- ye, you\r\ndogs--we’ll match you all presently.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUSTINGS AT BRENTFORD, MIDDLESEX ELECTION, 1768.\r\nSERJEANT GLYNN AND SIR W. BEAUCHAMP PROCTOR.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 178._]\r\n\r\nThe _Oxford Magazine_ (vol. i.) has printed the correspondence which\r\nensued upon the disgraceful violence and the attack on the hustings,\r\nin which several persons were injured and at least one fatally. The\r\ncandidate ultimately returned, John Glynn, began by addressing a\r\n“Letter to the Freeholders of Middlesex,” pledging himself that the\r\nblood of his constituents so wantonly shed should be vindicated, and\r\nthe charge brought home both to the hired and the hirers--“the more\r\nexalted their stations and the more privileged their persons, the\r\nlouder is the call for justice.” The serjeant continues, “The freedom\r\nof a county election is the last sacred privilege we have left; and\r\nit does not become any honest Englishman to wish to survive it. There\r\nis virtue still left in the country; we are come to a crisis, and the\r\nconsequence of this struggle shall determine whether we shall be Slaves\r\nor Free.”\r\n\r\nFollowing suit, Sir W. Beauchamp Proctor also addressed a letter to the\r\nfreeholders of Middlesex, rebutting the charges made against him. After\r\nreferring to twenty years, during which, by fair and honourable means,\r\nhe had endeavoured to obtain their esteem,--\r\n\r\n    “Calumniated as I have been during a long-depending canvass,\r\n    I was in hopes that every topic of defamation had been\r\n    exhausted; and I never expected that the daring and tumultuous\r\n    interruption of last Tuesday’s poll would have been ascribed to\r\n    me in so illiberal and inflammatory a style as my antagonist\r\n    has thought proper to use. For his conduct in the course of\r\n    this business the serjeant appeals to me, and I appeal to the\r\n    sense of mankind, whether a _band of writers_ has not been\r\n    let loose to be the _assassins of my reputation_? whether the\r\n    serjeant has not, in a manner unworthy of a gentleman and a\r\n    lawyer, exerted every effort to set up _usage_ in opposition to\r\n    the law of the land, and endeavoured in a dictatorial manner\r\n    to compel the sheriffs to close the poll in one day, to the\r\n    prejudice of the electors, and in violation of the authority\r\n    vested in the returning officers, by the wisdom of the\r\n    legislature.”\r\n\r\nProctor declared that he was not only struck by “the banditti,” but in\r\nthe utmost peril of his life.\r\n\r\n    “If a signal was given,--if _Proctor and Liberty_ appeared in\r\n    the hats of the ruffians, how that might be contrived by the\r\n    election arts of my adversaries need not now be mentioned. It\r\n    was the opinion of my counsel, when a riot was artfully talked\r\n    of by my opponents, _above an hour_ before it happened, that\r\n    the sheriffs in that case should resort immediately to the\r\n    protection of parliament.” Finally, he expressed hopes “to\r\n    bring this dark transaction into open daylight, and to show the\r\n    world who has been the man of blood;” moreover, the writer “has\r\n    full confidence that on the last day of the poll lawless men\r\n    will not again dare to invade the rights of the freeholders.”\r\n\r\nThe disavowal, which “doth protest too much” as published by Proctor,\r\ngoaded the virtuous indignation of the friends of freedom up to fever\r\nheat, and acted like a red rag on an infuriated bull in the instance\r\nof John Horne (Tooke), “the Brentford parson;” he addressed a scathing\r\nphilippic to Proctor, declaring that Sir William’s refutations\r\n“subscribed his own guilt, and that the Court candidate had signed his\r\nname to a lie:”--\r\n\r\n    “I here declare in form, that you, Sir William Beauchamp\r\n    Proctor, did both hire and cause to be hired, that mob\r\n    which committed the outrages at Brentford; that mob, which\r\n    immediately after the total interruption of the poll, demanded\r\n    which was the house that belonged to the parson of Brentford;\r\n    and to whose fury a neighbouring clergyman, who heard them ask\r\n    after my house, was apprehensive of falling a sacrifice, by the\r\n    mistake of a person who called himself by my name. Boast of\r\n    your humanity, Sir William, to Captain Read; that gentleman,\r\n    to save his own life, declared himself your friend. Persuade\r\n    Mr. Allen they were not your mob; that gentleman brought you to\r\n    the side of the hustings where they were, and heard them answer\r\n    to his question, and to your face, that you, Sir W. Beauchamp\r\n    Proctor, were the person that gave them orders for what they\r\n    were about.”\r\n\r\nAs to the “band of writers,” Parson Horne frankly avowed himself the\r\nauthor of most of the letters that appeared against Proctor in the\r\npapers, and concluded with a stinging reference to those “new-fashioned\r\nconstables,” as Sir John Fielding termed the hireling bullies.\r\n\r\n    “Where you endeavour to justify your proceedings by the usage\r\n    of all contested popular elections, and where you affect\r\n    to consider your hired ruffians, the Irish chairmen, as\r\n    ‘assistants to the civil magistrates.’ The business of the\r\n    approaching poll prevents my saying half what I have to tell\r\n    you; but I promise you, you shall hear from me again and again,\r\n    if you will please to issue out your orders to your ruffians to\r\n    grant me a _Reprieve_ till after the election.”\r\n\r\nThe main features of this ill-advised attack, which, it was believed,\r\nwas intended to put an end to the election should the polling prove\r\nadverse to the party in whose pay the hired mob acted, are given in the\r\n_Oxford Magazine_:--\r\n\r\n    “Thursday, Dec. 8, 1768. This day being appointed for the\r\n    Middlesex election, the candidates appeared on the hustings\r\n    at ten minutes before nine. Notwithstanding this, the opening\r\n    of the poll was delayed till near eleven. One of the narrow\r\n    avenues leading to Brentford butts was occupied very early\r\n    by a hired mob, with bludgeons, bearing favours in their\r\n    hats, inscribed, ‘Proctor and Liberty.’ A much larger, but\r\n    very compact body, armed as the former, and with the same\r\n    distinctions, were placed near the hustings, on an eminence,\r\n    and in a disposition which was evidently the arrangement of an\r\n    experienced sergeant. The rest of these banditti were stationed\r\n    in different quarters of the town, to strike a general terror\r\n    into the honest part of the freeholders; there was besides a\r\n    ‘corps de reserve’ which was to sally forth on a signal given.\r\n\r\n    “When these dispositions were secured, a chosen party of\r\n    butchers, in the same interest, traversed the town, and\r\n    insulted the hustings with marrow-bones and cleavers. When Sir\r\n    William Beauchamp Proctor’s numbers were nearly exhausted, and\r\n    the course of the Poll declared decisively for Mr. Serjeant\r\n    Glynn, who had still great multitudes unpolled, the signal\r\n    was given. An instantaneous and furious, but regular attack,\r\n    was made on the hustings. The sheriffs, the candidates (Glynn\r\n    declares himself as having been the last to depart), the\r\n    clerks, and the poll-books, all vanished in a moment.\r\n\r\n    “The whole town was presently a scene of blood. It was not\r\n    enough to knock down an unhappy man; the blow was followed till\r\n    he was utterly disabled. Those who have been exposed to riots\r\n    declare they never saw such cruelty. All doors and windows were\r\n    barricaded. There was no shelter, nothing was safe; nor can\r\n    anything equal the consternation of the frightened people but\r\n    the abhorrence and execration with which every tongue repeats\r\n    the name of Proctor.\r\n\r\n    “It appears from every account of the above proceedings, that\r\n    the people who began the riot there were the friends of the\r\n    court candidate; and, in particular, it is affirmed that when\r\n    the Irish chairmen, and the professed bruisers at their head,\r\n    had proceeded so far in their cruel and villainous intention of\r\n    murdering and wounding the people, that the gentlemen upon the\r\n    hustings began to be in danger of their lives,--one gentleman\r\n    went up to the court candidate, and expostulated with him on\r\n    the base conduct of _his mob_. ‘My mob!’ replied the courtier.\r\n    ‘Yes, sir, _your mob_!’ and the gentleman added, ‘Sir, I insist\r\n    upon your speaking to those fellows who are knocking down the\r\n    people there.’ But the courtier refused to say anything to\r\n    appease their fury; upon which the gentleman who had spoken\r\n    to him, finding himself in danger of his life, seized him by\r\n    the greatcoat, and showed his star to the armed ruffians,\r\n    who instantly took off their hats and huzza’d him; while the\r\n    ruffians were thus huzzaing, the gentleman escaped.”\r\n\r\nWhen the mob had cleared the hustings, they went into the town\r\nof Brentford, and attacked the Castle Inn, which was one of the\r\ncandidate’s houses of entertainment, and did considerable damage to it.\r\nThe inhabitants of the town, observing this mischief, and beginning to\r\nfear their own houses would next be destroyed,--\r\n\r\n    “a general indignation took place: they sallied forth, attacked\r\n    the rioters with great spirit, and drove them out of the town;\r\n    and some of the voters vented their rage upon one or two of the\r\n    houses opened for the other candidate. A number of persons with\r\n    Proctor’s cockades in their hats assembled about ‘The Angel\r\n    Inn’ at Islington in a riotous manner, armed with bludgeons.”\r\n\r\nThese well-paid hirelings were the worse for their potations, and, with\r\nthe ringleader, were taken into custody.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been a generally recognized stratagem imported into\r\nelection tactics, where, as in war, nothing was considered “unfair,” to\r\nget freeholders locked up on some fictitious pretence, such as false\r\nwrits, actions, summonses, or impounded as witnesses at trials, etc.;\r\nwhere the principal never appeared, and the hearing never came on,\r\nwhile the victims “to error” were detained in durance until after the\r\npoll was finished. On the occasion under consideration, it appeared\r\nthat a number of freeholders were particularly summoned as jurymen,\r\nto prevent their voting for the popular candidate; this manœuvre was\r\ndefeated, as concerned the Old Bailey, where the lord mayor, Turner,\r\nbehaved in a truly patriotic manner.\r\n\r\n    “When the jury was called, his Lordship asked them, upon their\r\n    honour, if any of them were freeholders of Middlesex; it\r\n    appeared that about eighteen of them were so (specially called\r\n    in order that their votes might be lost), on which his Lordship\r\n    immediately dismissed them, that they might not be hindered\r\n    from discharging their duty at Brentford.”\r\n\r\n    “Richard Dingham maketh oath that ‘the morning after the\r\n    meeting of Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, at St. Giles’s, he\r\n    saw four link-lighters named Welch, Hinton, Brady, and Quinn,\r\n    disputing about some money they had received from Sir William,\r\n    and they said that they had signed an agreement to go down,\r\n    with several others, to Brentford on the day of Election to\r\n    head a mob, and to put an end to the said Election, when they\r\n    should receive orders, etc.’”\r\n\r\nIn the interval, and during the progress of the election, several men\r\nwere committed to prison, including a chairman recognized as having\r\nacted as a leader, who was known as the “Infant,” being, in fact, a\r\nHercules over six feet high; the true facts of the case came out upon\r\nexamination, and, before the close of the poll, four affidavits were\r\npublished in the papers, the tenour of which went to prove criminal\r\ncomplicity.\r\n\r\n    “Atkinson Bush maketh oath that he was at Brentford on the day\r\n    of the election, and seeing a large body of men with labels in\r\n    their hats, whereon was written, ‘Proctor and Liberty,’ this\r\n    deponent asked them whether they were all voters for Proctor?\r\n    upon which they declared they had no votes, but had in their\r\n    hands what was as good, and showed him their bludgeons; and\r\n    being asked who they supposed would get the election, they\r\n    replied Proctor, swearing, if Glynn got the advantage, ‘By\r\n    G----, we will have his blood!”\r\n\r\nBroughton, the notorious pugilist, happened to find congenial\r\noccupation, having been selected as a temporary generalissimo of the\r\nforces, with special recruiting powers as to the enlistment of his\r\ndesperadoes.\r\n\r\n    “William Wheeler, Joyce, Davis, and other chairmen made oath\r\n    that they, with about forty of their order, were engaged\r\n    by Broughton, on the promise of a guinea a day each, for\r\n    the like purpose of putting an end to the election when the\r\n    signal should be given, and, according to the account of the\r\n    deponents, all the parties mentioned appeared at Brentford.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day (December 14), the poll for the election of a knight of\r\nthe shire for the county of Middlesex was peacefully concluded in the\r\npresence of the sheriffs and the justices of the peace of the county,\r\nattended by the constables to suppress any further demonstrations.\r\nAt the close, the numbers stood, for Serjeant Glynn, 1542; Sir W. B.\r\nProctor, 1278. It was said, “that the number polled on this occasion\r\nexceeded by forty-two the greatest number ever known to poll at any\r\nprevious election.”\r\n\r\nThe contest had been an expensive one; it was declared that Proctor\r\nand his party had been canvassing for six months; and, as an instance\r\nof the cost attending the election of a knight of the shire, it is\r\nset down as worthy of remark that the ribbons for hats alone, _i.e._\r\n“favours,” to distinguish Glynn’s friends, cost four hundred pounds;\r\nthe outlay of the Court candidate must have been excessively heavy.\r\n\r\n    “The populace in general, and the people of Brentford in\r\n    particular, were very desirous to chair Mr. Serjeant Glynn\r\n    after the sheriffs had declared his election; but he very\r\n    politely entreated them to decline it, which, after much\r\n    solicitation, they complied with.”\r\n\r\nIn the letter of acknowledgment addressed to his supporters in the\r\ncounty of Middlesex, the serjeant declares--\r\n\r\n    “As my private advantage and honour were by no means the\r\n    motives of your exertions in my behalf, so neither shall\r\n    they be the objects of my actions. I consider the choice\r\n    you have made of me for your representative as the most\r\n    authentic declaration of your abhorrence of those arbitrary\r\n    and oppressive measures which have too long disgraced the\r\n    administration of these kingdoms, and which, if pursued, cannot\r\n    fail to destroy our most excellent constitution.\r\n\r\n    “I hope that your example will lead other counties also to\r\n    assert their independence, and that the sacred flame of\r\n    liberty, which always ascends, will reach at length the higher\r\n    orders of this nation, and warm them likewise to a disdain of\r\n    offering or accepting the wages of corruption.”\r\n\r\nJohn Horne Tooke was only second to the successful candidate in the\r\neulogiums showered on his name and conduct at this emergency. A\r\nportrait of “the parson of Brentford” was published, representing him\r\nin his clerical guise, at full length, seated in his study at a table,\r\nwith his right arm resting on his “Treatise on Enclosing Commons,\r\naddressed to Sir Jno. Gibbins,” an essay which brought him an unusually\r\nhandsome acknowledgment; in his other hand is a reference to his\r\nlate correspondence with the defeated ministerial candidate--a paper\r\ninscribed, “Mobs made after the Court Fashion, by B. Proctor, Milliner\r\nof Brentford.”\r\n\r\nParson Horne wears a singular wig, with the sides in what has been\r\ndescribed as a “cornuted”[52] roll,--as peculiar as that affected by\r\nhis friend Wilkes, to whom he bears a further resemblance from the\r\nobliquity of his eyes, his right eye having been blind, and fixed in\r\nits orbit.\r\n\r\nThe “Parson of Brentford” appears in the _Oxford Magazine_; it is\r\nevident that Horne’s parliamentary aspirations were talked of at this\r\ntime, for opposite to the portrait is printed an “Extempore,--on the\r\nreport that a certain Clergyman has a view on a seat in the House of\r\nCommons.”\r\n\r\n    “And is it true, and can it be?\r\n      Does Freedom so inflame him?\r\n    Exalt the _Horne_ of Liberty;\r\n      No minister shall tame him.\r\n    Grant Heaven, we see it prove no jest,\r\n      But find, ere next November,\r\n    The man who makes a Patriot priest,\r\n      Become a Righteous Member.”\r\n\r\nA copy of verses, with a quotation, “Templum Libertatis,” due to the\r\npen of _Phileleutheros Oxoniensis_, confronts the copperplate portrait\r\nof Parson Horne:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO THE REV. JOHN HORNE, MINISTER OF BRENTFORD.\r\n\r\n    “O, sent by Heav’n in these dishonest days\r\n    In ev’ry breast to kindle Freedom’s blaze,\r\n    To snatch the cov’ring from the statesman’s heart,\r\n    And awful truths, without a fear, impart!\r\n    Tho’ ministerial thunders round thee roll,\r\n    They roll in vain, nor shock thy manly soul:\r\n    Thy country’s rights thy midnight labours claim,\r\n    And with a Sidney’s join thy honour’d name.\r\n    Superior thou to every threat shalt rise,\r\n    And from the hands of rapine wrest her prize.\r\n    Thy pen shall Vice in all her wiles reveal,\r\n    And trembling Graftons[53] shall its vengeance feel.\r\n    Nor shall the murd’rer, foe to man and God,\r\n    Tho’ sav’d by power, escape thy painful rod;\r\n    Nor shall corruption, unmolested stand,\r\n    Sap all our rights, and sink a venal land;\r\n    True to thy conscience, to thy country true,\r\n    Thou shalt detect and dash her conquests too.\r\n    Proctor shalt, blushing, all his failings own,\r\n    Sigh o’er his loss, and o’er his triumphs groan;\r\n    His hir’d assassins fill his breast with shame,\r\n    And trembling own the terror of thy name.\r\n    Proceed, great Sir, in Freedom’s glorious cause,\r\n    O! save thy country and thy country’s laws!\r\n    The wiles of Statesmen without fear disclose,\r\n    And be a foe to all thy country’s foes.\r\n    So shall thy friend,[54] who in confinement sighs,\r\n    Smile in his pains, and great in suffr’ing rise:\r\n    In health, an honest patriot own in thee,\r\n    And, dying, joy to leave his country FREE.”\r\n\r\nAs in the previous election, there was a charge of murder, which arose\r\nout of the irregularities then committed, and two Irish chairmen, Balfe\r\nand McQuirk, were tried for the death of Mr. George Clarke, “a young\r\ngentleman of the law, whom curiosity had brought to Brentford at the\r\nlate election.” References to this incident are given in the satirical\r\nprints and magazines, together with the usual report of the trial of\r\nthe malefactors. “The Present State of Surgery; or, Modern Practice”\r\n(Dec. 14, 1768), appeared in the _Universal Magazine_, vol. v. (April,\r\n1769). This engraving shows Mr. Clarke, whose skull was fatally\r\ninjured by a blow from a bludgeon, placed between two doctors, who are\r\nexamining his head: one, a surgeon, is declaring, “If the fever does\r\nnot kill him, contusions and fractures are nothing;” the other is of\r\nopinion, “A court plaister will remove the disorder.” One of a group of\r\nsurgeons is inquiring of the senior, “Shall we apply the trepan, sir?”\r\n“A Glyster” is proposed as likely to “evacuate the broken pieces of\r\nbone.” The authors of the mischief, or some of the Irish bludgeon men,\r\nare standing by, and discussing the case: “The doctor says a broken\r\nskull’s nothing if they can but cure the fever.” His companion replies,\r\n“Thank God, we need not fear being knock’d on the head then!” A\r\nbystander is remarking, “I catch’d a fever from a bludgeon at Brentford\r\nmyself”--many persons besides Clarke having complained of maltreatment\r\nduring these riots. “Ay, they were deadly wise at the Election time,”\r\nis the opinion of another. A spectator ejaculates, “I wish those Irish\r\ndogs had kept the distemper to themselves--it’s worse than the Itch!” a\r\ndouble-barrelled allusion to the two trials for wilful murder which had\r\narisen out of the successive Middlesex elections--the Irish chairmen\r\nwho were the cause of Clarke’s death, and the Scotch soldiers who\r\nkilled Allen. The contusion proved fatal; after languishing a few days\r\nthe unfortunate young gentleman succumbed.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the two chairmen, Balfe and McQuirk, came on at the Old\r\nBailey, January 14, 1769, and though the prisoners were provided\r\nwith an array of learned counsellors, to the number of five, for\r\ntheir defence, they were pronounced “guilty,” and sentenced to\r\ntransportation. An appeal was made to arrest judgment, but it was\r\noverruled, and the sentences ordered to be executed. Court influence,\r\nin the interval, procured a respite, and the men ultimately received\r\na royal pardon, signed by Lord Rochford, secretary of state, which\r\nproduced severe animadversions; see “Junius to the Duke of Grafton,”\r\nand the notes to this letter by John Wade (Edin. 1850). In the\r\n_Political Register_ (IV.) is a copy of the document setting Balfe\r\nand McQuirk free. Meanwhile the College of Surgeons was consulted, to\r\nexonerate the guilty, to the dissatisfaction of the public.\r\n\r\n    “It is said that on a late chirurgical examination, there was\r\n    the greatest privacy imaginable supported; not only several\r\n    young surgeons (who, being advertised of the meeting, went\r\n    there for the sake of instruction) were denied admittance, but\r\n    there were two sentinels on the outside of the door to prevent\r\n    any person from listening. Strange inquisitorial proceedings!”\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the master, wardens, and examiners of the Surgeons’ Company,\r\nten in number, of whom five had appointments under administration,\r\nthe president being one, and consequently holding the casting-vote\r\n(three of the committee actually held at that time appointments of\r\n“sergeant-surgeon” to the king, and another was surgeon to the Dowager\r\nPrincess of Wales, his mother), met at their hall in the Old Bailey, in\r\npursuance of a letter from the Earl of Rochford, one of His Majesty’s\r\nprincipal secretaries of state, desiring their opinion in relation to\r\na doubt that had arisen whether the blow which Mr. Clarke received at\r\nthe election at Brentford was the cause of his death; and the above\r\ngentlemen, after examining the surgeons, apothecary, and several\r\nothers (_in camera_, as alleged), returned an answer the same evening\r\nto his lordship, giving it as their unanimous opinion, that the blow\r\nwas not the cause of Mr. Clarke’s death. A satirical print, given in\r\nthe _Oxford Magazine_ as “A Consultation of Surgeons” (Feb. 27, 1769),\r\nexhibits the supposititious explanation of the inquiry and verdict.\r\nThe surgeons are grouped round a table, on which are pens and ink. The\r\npresident is pointing to the decision of the conclave, set down to\r\norder for Lord Rochford--“It does not appear that he died----” At the\r\nsame time a large and well-filled bag of money, held up temptingly in\r\nthe president’s right hand, appears the most conclusive evidence before\r\nthe corporation. The chairman observes, “This [the money] convinces\r\nme that Clarke did not die of the wound he received at Brentford.”\r\nA Scotch surgeon is asserting, “By my Soul, his head was too thick\r\nto be broken, or he would ne’er ha’ gang’d to Brentford.” The next\r\nspeaker, regarding the weighty motive in the president’s charge, avers,\r\n“Another such bag would convince me Clarke never received any blow.” A\r\nsurgeon, with his gold-headed cane to his nose, is convinced, “Gold is\r\ngood evidence, and carries great weight.” In reference to the surgeon\r\nFoot, who, called in at the time, deposed at the trial that Clarke\r\ndied of the blow on head, but was of opinion that his life might have\r\nbeen saved by judicious treatment, one of the consulting body, rising\r\nfrom his seat, is declaring, “Devil burn me, but that same surgeon\r\nwas a blockhead; how should a Foot be able to judge of the Head?” The\r\nverdict of the College of Surgeons excited popular disgust, and various\r\nreflections were cast upon the method by which it was arrived at. The\r\nfollowing appeared in the _Public Ledger_ (April 13, 1769):--\r\n\r\n    “It is confidently repeated, that while a certain party of\r\n    gentlemen were assembled together, in order to consult about\r\n    vindicating themselves against Mr. Foot’s appeal, the ghost of\r\n    Mr. Clarke appeared, and behaved in a most gross and insulting\r\n    manner to the whole committee, which so terrified them all,\r\n    that they have been very ill ever since, and it is thought some\r\n    will not recover.”\r\n\r\nConsiderable interest attaches to the struggle in question, which made\r\nWilkes a hero for a while. It was a time of trial as regarded the\r\ninviolability of the constitution. The ministers, safe in their bought\r\nmajority in the Commons, ready to vote mechanically, seemed utterly\r\ncallous as to the consequences of those infractions they were making\r\non national liberties, presumably secured on an unassailable basis.\r\nThe more impartial-minded of the people began to dread the attempted\r\nrevival of despotic and irresponsible government and of those evils\r\nwhich had been guarded against by great exertions, firmness, and no\r\nslight sacrifices in the past. The spirit of resistance was abroad,\r\nand ministers for their own purposes disguised by every means the true\r\ncondition of affairs from the head of the State. As the violation of\r\npopular liberties recalled the struggles which marked the later Stuart\r\nera, so were the means taken to resist these encroachments compared\r\nto the conduct of the people and their tribunes under the same trying\r\ncircumstances. Petitions and remonstrances began to make ministers\r\ntremble lest the sympathies of the throne might be turned to their\r\nproper channel, the people.\r\n\r\nAnother election for Middlesex occurred in 1769, _vice_ Wilkes; the\r\nresults were that Wilkes was returned at the head of the poll, while\r\nhis opponent (with a quarter of his votes) was declared duly elected.\r\nOn the subject of Colonel Luttrell’s admission to the House much\r\nwas said which must have been unpalatable to the Court. The _Oxford\r\nMagazine_ printed a list of those members who were so patriotically\r\ninclined as to resist this brazen violation of the constitution,\r\nas “the Minority who voted 1148 in preference to 296;” while those\r\nmembers who servilely voted for the right of the ministers to impose\r\na defeated candidate on the Commons were described as “the Majority\r\nwho preferred 296 to 1143.” A list is given of these placemen,\r\npensioners, and courtiers, with particulars against their respective\r\nnames which account for their lack of principle, all being in receipt\r\nof State patronage, or emolument of one kind or another, sufficient to\r\nprove that self-interest was their guiding principle, and that their\r\nconsciences were closed by the greed of preferment. The despotic action\r\nenforced by the administration, in defiance of the principles of the\r\nconstitution,--a common practice in the reign of George III.,--provoked\r\na very pertinent disquisition upon the potentiality of the bulwark of\r\npopular rights. The great Lord Bacon, somewhere talking of the power\r\nof parliaments, says, there is nothing which a parliament cannot do;\r\nand he had reason. A parliament can revive or abrogate old laws,\r\nand make new ones; settle the succession to the Crown; impose taxes;\r\nestablish forms of religion; naturalize foreigners; dissolve marriages;\r\nlegitimate bastards; attaint a man of treason, etc. Lord Bolingbroke,\r\nindeed, is of a different opinion, and affirms there is something which\r\na parliament cannot do: it cannot annul the constitution; and that if\r\nit should attempt to annul the constitution, the whole body of the\r\npeople would have a right to resist it. It is natural, too, to think\r\nthat Lord Bacon limited the power of parliament, great as he believed\r\nit, to those things which do not imply a physical impossibility.\r\nModern ministers, however, have shown that a parliament is able, at\r\nleast in appearance, to effect even such impossibilities. Sir Robert\r\nWalpole was wont to boast that he had “trained his fellows,” as he\r\ncalled his venal majority in the House of Commons, “in such a manner,\r\nand brought them to such exact discipline, that were he to desire them\r\nto vote Jesus Christ a Gildon” (_i.e._ the head of an infidel sect,\r\nGildon being a deistical writer in Walpole’s day) “he was sure of their\r\ncompliance.” The ministry then in office (the Grafton administration),\r\nas will appear by the list referred to above, had assumed a power no\r\nless arbitrary and equally unreasonable, by persuading their servile\r\nmajority to vote in defiance of the constitution on the question of\r\nColonel Luttrell’s qualifications to sit in the Commons--that the 296\r\nsuffrages (recorded for Luttrell) were preferable to the 1143 polled\r\nfor Wilkes.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial conduct on the case of Wilkes and upon the events\r\narising therefrom, joined with their ill-advised manœuvres on behalf\r\nof their own chosen candidates, produced a marked effect on the\r\nconstituencies elsewhere, and, as Horace Walpole writes to his friend,\r\nSir H. Mann (March 23, 1769), towns began to break off from their\r\nallegiance to the administration in power, and sent instructions\r\nto their members to oppose the measures of the Court party. “As\r\nthe session approached, Lord Chatham engaged with a new warmth in\r\npromoting petitions.” In opposition alike to the “Remonstrances,”\r\nand to those who questioned the policy of turning a deaf ear to the\r\npetitions of the nation--loyal to the throne, but earnestly set upon\r\nthe reform of abuses and the extinction of “grievances,”--the ministers\r\nencouraged their adherents to secure addresses approving their acts,\r\nand praying the throne to disregard petitions for rights. The public\r\nprints satirized these servile expressions, manufactured to order,\r\nwhile the wits and caricaturists mercilessly exposed the _modus\r\noperandi_ of fabricating these illegitimate addresses. According to\r\nHorace Walpole, Calcraft and Sir John Mawbey “by zeal and activity\r\nobtained a petition from the county of Essex, though neither the High\r\nSheriff, the members, nor any one gentleman of the county would attend\r\nthe meeting.” It was the old story of the Essex petitions over again,\r\nas already set down in the group of “Election Ballads” under Charles\r\nII., when the same county made itself conspicuous in a similar fashion:\r\n“It was thought wise,” wrote Walpole, “to procure loyal addresses, and\r\none was obtained from Essex, which being the great county for calves,\r\nobtained nothing but ridicule.” A pictorial version sets forth the\r\nsituation (March 6, 1769) as “The Essex Procession from Chelmsford to\r\nSt. James’s Market, for the good of the Common-Veal.” The engraving\r\nrepresents a street ending in the archway of St. James’s, towards\r\nwhich are progressing two carts, drawn by donkeys tandem-wise, and\r\nfilled with bleating calves. The cart is driven by Rigby, the Duke of\r\nBedford’s factotum, a supporter of the Court, much interested in the\r\npetitions presented to the king at this period: this political agent\r\nis travestied as an ass; he is crying, “Calves’ Heads à la daube!\r\nWho’ll buy my veal?” One of the victimized calves in the cart is\r\nbleating, “This is a Rig-by-Jove;” another exclaims, “How we expose\r\nourselves!” The other charioteer is intended for C. Dingley, author of\r\nthe “Saw-mill” experiment at Limehouse, and who was an influential\r\nprojector of the new “City-road;” he was a creature of the Duke of\r\nGrafton, a prominent ally of the Court faction against Wilkes and the\r\npatriots, and was generally obnoxious to the more constitutionally\r\nminded of the citizens. Dingley is transformed into an ox, and he\r\nis made to declare to his special consignment of calves, “Friends\r\nand Countrymen, you shall not be misrepresented.” One of the calf\r\ncontingent, mindful of slaughter, is bleating, “I hope they won’t\r\ndrive us to St. George’s Fields,” the place of slaughter--otherwise,\r\nthe scene of the recent wanton attacks of the Scottish soldiery on the\r\npeople; while another of Dingley’s followers is expressing a wish that\r\nthe famous saw-mills, which were the cause of a riot in which they were\r\ndemolished, might prove the destruction of the speculator himself. In\r\nopposition to the “foolish Essex address,” it was, as described in\r\nthe _Gentleman’s Magazine_, “resolved at a meeting of gentlemen held\r\nat Chelmsford, December 15, 1769, to support the right of election to\r\nParliament, and to petition the king for a dissolution of Parliament.”\r\n\r\nThe Essex address was followed up, on the part of what were entitled\r\nLondon merchants, by a similar production, which was chiefly promoted\r\nby Charles Dingley; a version of this transaction is entitled “The\r\nAddressers.” It appears that “officious tools,” and interested, if not\r\nbribed, citizens, designated as “the Merchants of London,” attended,\r\nMarch 8, 1769, at the King’s Arms Tavern, Cornhill, at the invitation\r\nof Dingley and his followers. One shilling was charged at the door to\r\nkeep away the crowd, ostensibly to defray the expense of the room; and\r\none Lovell, having complied with this, found Dingley with a few others\r\nassembled. Mr. Muilmann, a German or Dutch stockbroker, professionally\r\nnicknamed “Van Scrip,” gave Lovell a copy of the address to read,\r\nand told him he could sign the original then on the table; but on\r\nLovell’s expressing that “he did not approve of the address,” Dingley\r\nordered him out; but, having paid his shilling, he stood on his\r\nright to remain. Then followed Reynolds (who was Wilkes’s attorney),\r\nand having paid his shilling, and refusing to sign the address, was\r\nalso asked to leave, but elected to enjoy the privilege of remaining.\r\nVaughan and others did the same. The room being then filled, when Mr.\r\nCharles Pole was invited to take the chair at the suggestion of the\r\nanti-addressers, their opponents “opposed all order,” repeating the\r\ncry of “No chair!” with the utmost fury, and threatening to “turn\r\ndown stairs all who called for any chairman.” The chair itself became\r\nan object of contention between the hostile parties; one secured the\r\nseat, another the frame, and the “abhorrers of disorder” triumphed\r\nuntil another chair was obtained. The ticklish office of president\r\nwas at last accepted by Mr. Vaughan. Attorney Reynolds was standing\r\nnear the chairman, when Dingley, enraged at the success of this\r\ncounter-demonstration, addressing him as a “d----d scoundrel,” struck\r\nhim a violent blow in the face; on which provocation, Reynolds, being\r\nof commanding size, knocked Dingley down. “Many were the efforts made\r\nto dispossess Mr. Vaughan of the chair, strokes were aimed at him with\r\ncanes and sticks, but the blows were warded off by his friends.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the disturbance set forth in the satirical engraving of “The\r\nAddressers” (March 8, 1769), in which is represented the _fracas_\r\nat the King’s Arms Tavern consequent on this insidious attempt to\r\nmanufacture a bogus address. Attorney Reynolds’s wig is awry, from\r\nthe blow inflicted by Dingley; he is knocking the latter out of the\r\nchair, and exclaiming, “I’ll make you pay for this.” Dingley is\r\nsaying, “For this £2000 more;” while, in falling, from his pocket\r\ndrops a paper, “Saw-mill, £2000.” “Van Scrip,” Muilmann, alluding to\r\nthe cash considerations held out by the ministers to their allies, is\r\nextending his hand, and crying in dismay, “We shall lose this scrip!” A\r\nspectator, armed with a riding-whip, is asserting, “You’ll be Jockey’d,\r\nMynheer.” The persons in the crowd are demanding, “A chair! a chair!”\r\nwhile others shout to the contrary; the chair itself is mounted on\r\na table placed in the middle of the room. Mr. Apvan (Vaughan) is\r\noccupying this perilous distinction. “Why _address_, Gentlemen?” is\r\nhis question to the meeting. A slight fencing-match is going on; the\r\nchairman holding his own, while those who attack him cry “Order.”\r\nA clergyman--no other than the “Brentford Parson” in person--is\r\nsuggesting the propriety of “an Address to keep the streets clean,”\r\nthe condition of the thoroughfares in London being the subject of\r\ncomplaint at this time. From the report of these proceedings published\r\nin the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, it appears that a speaker asserted that\r\nthe “proper functions of such an assembly were to order the scavengers\r\nto clean the streets, and beadles to remove vagrants from them.” The\r\nfragments of the chair first dismantled, as described, are in the\r\nhands of some of the company by the door. A man has gone down in his\r\nexertions “to stand up for the Address.” The incendiary document in\r\nquestion is carried off by one Mr. Phelim O’Error, who is declaring,\r\n“I’ll take it to the Merchant Seamen’s Office,” to which it was removed\r\non the next stage of its career.\r\n\r\nAnother version of these proceedings appeared, March 8, 1769, as “The\r\nBattle of Cornhill;” an engraving given in the _Town and Country\r\nMagazine_, with a short parody in the style of a drama on the subject,\r\nas detailed in the foregoing “Addressers.” The counter-assault upon\r\nDingley is similarly illustrated. Reynolds, the Attorney Freeman of\r\nthe drama, is depicted as a tall, burly man. Dingley is made to cry,\r\n“Murder, murder. Oh, the rascal. I’ll have him imprisoned seven years\r\nfor this illegal attack. He has done me twelve hundred, if not two\r\nthousand pounds damage.” Van Scrip is much alarmed: “Heaven! what will\r\nbecome of me! I shall lose all my interest in the Treasury, if we fail\r\nin carrying it. I shan’t have a single government contract, not so much\r\nas a thousand pounds scrip.” An anecdote is related in the _London\r\nMuseum_ (ii. 1770, p. 32) concerning the use of lottery tickets as\r\nbribes by the Government, where Bradshaw, secretary to the Treasury,\r\nstigmatized by “Junius” as “the cream-coloured parasite,” is alleged\r\nto have “met the member for Buckinghamshire (Lowndes), and offered two\r\nhundred lottery tickets at ten pounds each, which were accepted.” Scrip\r\nand lottery tickets were freely employed for political bribery at this\r\nperiod, as Walpole mentions in his “Memoirs of the Reign of King George\r\nthe Third,” and Sir H. N. Wraxall describes in his “Historical Memoirs.”\r\n\r\n“The Inchanted Castle; or, King’s Arms in an Uproar” (March 8, 1769)\r\nis a further pictorial version of the same occurrence, with little\r\nvariation as to the persons or incidents represented, but containing\r\na reference, like the last, to the “London Tavern,” the recognized\r\nhead-quarters and meeting-place for the Society of Supporters of the\r\nBill of Rights, and consequently opposed to sycophantic admiration of\r\nministerial illegalities. Beneath the print in question is a copy of\r\nverses, beginning--\r\n\r\n    “I sing the bloody fight and dire alarms\r\n    ’Twixt London Tavern and King’s Arms.\r\n    Planning Addresses Dingley’s party sate,\r\n    And meditating on their Country’s fate.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole thus describes the transactions represented in the\r\nforegoing:--\r\n\r\n    “The merchants of London, to the number of six or eight\r\n    hundred, amongst whom were Dutch, Jews, and any officious\r\n    tools that they could assemble, having signed one of those\r\n    servile panegyrics [addresses], set out in a long procession of\r\n    coaches, to carry it to St. James’s.”\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ by which the address was promoted is fancifully\r\nsummed up in the plate of the _Oxford Magazine_, vol. ii., p. 134, “The\r\nPrincipal Merchants and Traders assembled at the Merchant Seamen’s\r\nOffice, to sign ye Address.” This print represents a further stage in\r\nthe progress of the transaction. The _Public Advertiser_, March 11,\r\n1769, announces, “For these two Days past, numbers of the Merchants\r\nand principal Traders of London have attended at the Merchant Seamen’s\r\nOffice, over the Royal Exchange, in order to sign an Address to his\r\nMajesty, etc.”\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the _Oxford Magazine_, “So eager were the ministers to\r\nprocure a long list of subscribers that, it is credibly reported, some\r\nof the addresses of the then ‘City Merchants,’ were signed by cobblers,\r\nporters, chairmen, livery-servants, and the very meanest of the rabble;\r\nfor as the number of hands was the chief point of view, they cared\r\nbut little of what rank or condition they were.” The caricaturist has\r\ncarried out this view of the signatories. The chairman or president is\r\na butcher, whose tray, containing a shoulder of mutton, is laid down\r\nat his feet; he is filled with loyal frenzy, and, with his butcher’s\r\nknife grasped ready for action, is exclaiming, “I shall stick my knife\r\nin _Magna Charta_, and cut up the carcase of the Bill of Rights.” A\r\nporter, with his knot, is anathematizing Wilkes’s “swivel eyes,” and\r\nwishing he “may sink under his load.” The petition is being signed by\r\na barber, with his bowl under his arm, together with an aldermanic wig\r\njust ordered: “Ah, I’ve got an order for a new wig, only for signing\r\nmy name.” A Scotch pedlar, with pack and staff, one of Lord Bute’s\r\nfollowers, declares, “Sawney mun sign too, gin it be to the De’il, for\r\nmy guid laird’s sake.” A journeyman baker, with a basketful of loaves\r\non his back, is coming in succession, well paid for his assistance:\r\n“Brother Merchants, follow my example, and you’ll never want bread;”\r\nand even a sooty chimney-sweep has expectations of ministerial\r\npatronage, “Who knows but I may be appointed to a Chimney at Court?”\r\nProminent among those at the table whereon is the much-denounced\r\n“Address,” is a Jew money-jobber, who is elated at his prospects of\r\na Treasury “job,” “Oh! for a large portion of scrip!” and the Dutch\r\nstockbroker, Van Scrip, is exclaiming, “Ah! de gross Scrip for Mynheer\r\ntoo,”--the subscription scrip to government loans, profitable to those\r\nwho secured preference allotments, and, as described, alleged to be\r\nmanipulated by the ministry in the nature of bribery.\r\n\r\nThe strictures provoked upon the underhand methods by which these\r\naddresses were forced upon the public are exemplified in an “Epistle\r\nto the _North Briton_,” which appeared in the _Oxford Magazine_, to\r\naccompany the engraving of the “Addressing Merchants.” The epistle is\r\nlengthy, and we have only room for the opening passages. It is possibly\r\nwritten by the “Brentford Parson;” indeed, the manner as well as matter\r\nindicates the authorship suggested. The motto is given, “There is\r\nnothing new under the sun” (_Eccles._ i. 9)--\r\n\r\n    “And so, sir, what you have often foretold is at last come to\r\n    pass. We are fairly fallen back into the very dregs of the\r\n    Stuart reigns. The party of _Abhorrers_ is once more revived;\r\n    of those _Abhorrers_, who, in the reign of King Charles the\r\n    Second, expressed their detestation of all the patriotic and\r\n    public spirited, as I would say--but, as they were pleased\r\n    to call them, the factious and insolent petitions that were\r\n    presented to the king for assembling a parliament, and for\r\n    securing the other rights and liberties of the People.\r\n\r\n    “That such wretches should have existed at a time when the\r\n    Sovereign claimed, and many of his subjects were willing to\r\n    allow him, a divine, indefeasible, hereditary right to play the\r\n    tyrant, and to destroy the constitution is nothing strange; but\r\n    that any such should be found in the reign of a prince, whose\r\n    family was advanced to the throne in direct contradiction to\r\n    this absurd principle, would be really surprising, did we not\r\n    know that human nature is always the same, and that though the\r\n    seeds of slavery may be smothered for a time, yet whenever\r\n    they meet with the vivifying influence of court sunshine, they\r\n    immediately begin to quicken, and to spring up with vigour. And\r\n    never, sure, did these seeds meet with a more fertile soil,\r\n    or a more benign sky, than under the present arbitrary and\r\n    despotic administration, when every man is sure to be rewarded\r\n    in exact proportion to the servility of his character.\r\n\r\n    “In this respect, indeed, the present ministers have greatly\r\n    the advantage of all that have gone before them; for I do\r\n    not remember a single compliment paid to the _Abhorrers_, in\r\n    the reign of King Charles the Second, except the honour of\r\n    knighthood conferred upon Francis Withers, Esq., who procured\r\n    and presented the Address from the City of Westminster. But\r\n    how much more grateful and generous have been our present\r\n    ministers! They have made the late chief City Magistrate a\r\n    Privy Councillor, and have given him a contract with government\r\n    for clothing soldiers, worth £1000 per annum. They have\r\n    pardoned the murderers MacLaughlin, Balfe, and McQuirk, and\r\n    have even granted them pensions. This, say the ministry, is\r\n    only supporting their friends; but, if murderers be their\r\n    friends, I believe few people will envy them the credit of such\r\n    a connection.\r\n\r\n    “Some of the addresses in the reign of the Stuarts breathed a\r\n    very free and independent spirit. That of the Quakers, upon the\r\n    accession of King James the Second, may serve as an instance.\r\n    It was conceived in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    “‘We come,’ said they, ‘to testify our sorrow for the death of\r\n    our good friend Charles, and our joy for thy being made our\r\n    governor. We are told thou art not of the persuasion of the\r\n    Church of England, no more than we; wherefore we hope thou wilt\r\n    grant us the same liberty which thou allowest thyself. Which\r\n    doing, we wish thee all manner of happiness.’\r\n\r\n    “There we see the Quakers, with their usual plainness and\r\n    simplicity, very roundly tell his majesty, that he was not a\r\n    member of the church of England; a circumstance, which was\r\n    then thought by many, and hath since been declared by law, to\r\n    be sufficient to disqualify him for wearing the crown of these\r\n    Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n    “But how much more courtly and polite is the language of our\r\n    present Addressers. They not only pay the highest compliments\r\n    to the King, which he certainly deserves, they even offer\r\n    the most nauseous and fulsome flattery to his ministers and\r\n    servants, and express their entire approbation of every part\r\n    of their conduct. They must therefore approve of the robbery\r\n    committed upon the Duke of Portland, of the massacre in St.\r\n    George’s Fields, of the riot and murders at Brentford, of\r\n    withdrawing MacLaughlin from the cognizance of the laws, and of\r\n    pardoning Balfe and McQuirk after they had been fairly tried\r\n    and condemned by their country.\r\n\r\n    “But, not satisfied with declaring their approbation of the\r\n    conduct of the ministry, they express their utter abhorrence\r\n    and detestation of the conduct of those who have had the\r\n    presumption to oppose them. They must, therefore, _abhor_ the\r\n    conduct of the Freeholders of Middlesex, who chose Mr. Wilkes\r\n    and Mr. Serjeant Glynn, their representatives in parliament,\r\n    in spite of all the violent, outrageous, and illegal attempts\r\n    which the ministry made to prevent them. They must _abhor_\r\n    the conduct of the 139 independent members who voted against\r\n    the expulsion of Mr. Wilkes from an august assembly, of\r\n    which they form the respectable, and perhaps even the most\r\n    wealthy, tho’ not the most numerous part. They must _abhor_\r\n    the conduct of the Citizens of London, of the Citizens of\r\n    Westminster, of the Freeholders of Middlesex, and of all the\r\n    other counties and corporations, who, in their instructions to\r\n    their representatives, have disapproved of those very measures\r\n    which the Addressers approve. In a word, they must abhor the\r\n    conduct, at least the sentiments, of ninety-nine parts in a\r\n    hundred of the people of England, who, if taken separately, and\r\n    fairly interrogated, would be found to entertain opinions very\r\n    different from those of the Addressers.”\r\n\r\nThe “Battle of Cornhill,” otherwise the fight for the signatures to the\r\nservile loyal address as already described, was followed by another\r\nstage in the contest, an attempt to carry the address in state through\r\nthe city, the procession being stopped by a conflict in Fleet Street,\r\nof which turbulent episode a caricature appeared, March 22, 1769, under\r\nthe title of the “Battle of Temple Bar.” The engraving offers a vista\r\nof Fleet Street; the Devil Tavern, the arched entrance to the Temple,\r\nand Nando’s Coffee-house are shown to the right; the gates of the bar\r\nare closed, and around is a scene of confused conflict. The decapitated\r\nheads of Fletcher and Townley, stuck on poles over Temple Bar, are\r\nrepresented in conversation. The Jacobites executed for their share in\r\nthe Scottish raid of 1745 are inquiring whether the Addressers are not\r\n“friends to the cause which we all love so dear,” and which had planted\r\ntheir heads on the bar over twenty years before. A carriage, drawn by\r\ntwo horses, is the centre of the struggle; the coachman is observing\r\n“They all seem in a fair way;” the rabble are pelting the vehicle,\r\nfrom which the person charged with the care of the loyal address is\r\nmaking his escape. Another member of the party bound for St. James’s is\r\nseeking shelter from the shower of missiles at the entrance to Nando’s.\r\nOther coaches have been subjected to similar indignities; the servants\r\nare declaring, “Our masters are finely bedaubed!” The city marshal\r\nand his charger are under fire from the mob; grasping his baton and\r\nholding his hat to protect his face, the marshal declares, “I find I\r\nmust go to y^e Devil!” The Devil, perched on the sign of the famous\r\ntavern christened after his name, is crying, with a Scotch twang, “in\r\ncompliment to my Lord Bute,” “Fly to me, my Bairns!” This plate is\r\ngiven in the _London Magazine_, with an account of the pelting and\r\nflight of those who were engaged in carrying the address to the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEQUEL TO THE BATTLE OF TEMPLE BAR--PRESENTATION OF THE\r\nLOYAL ADDRESS AT ST. JAMES’S PALACE. 1769.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 201._]\r\n\r\nThe concluding stage in the progress of the address and the cavalcade\r\nof carriages which attended it, was marked by the appearance of the\r\nsatirical engraving entitled the “Sequel to the Battle of Temple Bar,”\r\n1769, of which a reduced fac-simile is given. The spot represented\r\nis the front of St. James’s Palace, facing St. James’s Street. The\r\nremnants of the procession of merchants charged with the address in\r\nsupport of the ministry in power are escaping down Pall Mall, the\r\ncarriages, with broken windows, being followed by galling volleys of\r\nstones and dirt on the part of the mob, while a hearse exhibiting\r\ninflammatory placards is accorded an enthusiastic reception. The\r\nspectators gathered at the St. James’s Coffee House and around the\r\npalace are encouraging the hostile demonstration; the courtiers are\r\nsurveying the tumult from the gateway and windows of St. James’s\r\nPalace. A person mounted on the tower, and assumed to be intended\r\nfor Lord Bute, is pointing to the weathercock, exclaiming, “High\r\nnorth wind,” _i.e._ a Scotch wind. The Guards are making attacks\r\nupon individuals; a gentleman is being surrounded; the violence\r\nof the soldiers is watched by a clergyman, evidently intended for\r\nParson Horne, whose eye was upon those who infringed the rights of\r\nthe subjects or unlawfully maltreated any of the people. A burlesque\r\nfuneral procession diversified the proceedings, headed by a mounted\r\nmute, wearing a crape weeper, with mourning staff, the hearse drawn by\r\ntwo wretched screws, one black and one white; the coachman is equally\r\nodd--the person who drove was declared to have been a frolicsome\r\nlordling, it is said young Earl Mountmorres. The body of this vehicle\r\ndisplays a flaring placard--the presentment of an Irish chairman\r\nstriking with a bludgeon a person who is knocked down and defenceless;\r\nthis moving picture, inscribed “Brentford,” represents the fate of Mr.\r\nClarke, whose fractured skull, caused by the brutal attack of Proctor’s\r\nhired ruffians, ended in his death. Similar placards, “St. George’s\r\nFields” and “Scot Victory,” are posted on the hearse to remind the\r\nministers that the odium of the massacre of the people at St. George’s\r\nFields, and the deliberate assassination of William Allen (May 10,\r\n1768), by a grenadier of the Scottish Regiment, were not forgotten; a\r\ncoloured picture of this episode was displayed on the other side of\r\nthe hearse. A diversion is attempted at the entrance to the palace\r\ngates, where the figure of a short nobleman is distinguishable by the\r\nstar on his coat; he is using his broken official staff like a sword.\r\nThis personage, who actually seized one of the rioters, and who is\r\nintended for Earl Talbot, lord steward of the household, is bareheaded,\r\nhis wig having been displaced in the scuffle with the people, and,\r\nfinally, a knock on the head cooled his courage; the Guards are coming\r\nto his support. Further details of the ending of this vexed question\r\nof the address are given in the political intelligence of the time.\r\nFrom all accounts, Mr. Boehm, in whose charge was the fateful roll,\r\nwas too occupied in securing his own safety to trouble about the fate\r\nof the address. It appears that the scattered procession went on to\r\nSt. James’s without the presenter of the document which had entailed\r\nso many embarrassments. According to the _Political Register_, a\r\nmessenger was despatched back to the coffee-house for the address;\r\nwhere “Mr. Boehm, having missed it, remained in great suspense.” After\r\nmany inquiries and great alarm, the roll was found under the seat of\r\nthe coach, where, by a miracle, it had escaped the search of the mob;\r\nthe address was immediately forwarded to St. James’s, where it was\r\nexpectantly awaited.\r\n\r\nThe history of this incident is taken up by the _Political Register_\r\nfor 1769:--\r\n\r\n    “The merchants and traders who retired with the address\r\n    mentioned in the account of the proceedings at the ‘King’s\r\n    Arms,’ having by means of repeated advertisements and private\r\n    letters obtained a considerable number of persons to sign\r\n    the said address at the Merchant Seamen’s Office over the\r\n    Royal Exchange; ... Wednesday, the 22nd March, at two in the\r\n    afternoon, being appointed, on that day at noon, a great number\r\n    of the merchants, etc., of this city, set out from the Royal\r\n    Exchange in their carriages, in order to present an address\r\n    to His Majesty, attended by the City Marshal and constables;\r\n    before they got to Cheapside, the mob showed them many marks\r\n    of their resentment, by hissing, groaning, throwing dirt,\r\n    etc., but when they arrived at Fleet Street, the multitude\r\n    grew quite outrageous, broke the windows of the coaches, threw\r\n    stones and glass bottles, and dispatched a party to shut up\r\n    the gates at Temple Bar, on which the cavalcade was obliged to\r\n    stop. Mr. Cook, the City Marshal, going to open the gates with\r\n    his attendants, was very severely treated; his clothes were\r\n    torn off his back and his head cut in two places. The populace\r\n    then attacked the gentlemen in their carriages; Mr. Boehm (who\r\n    carried the roll) and several of his friends being covered with\r\n    dirt, were obliged to take refuge in Nando’s Coffee-house. Some\r\n    of the coaches then drove up Chancery Lane, Fetter Lane, and\r\n    Shoe Lane; but the greater part of the gentlemen, finding it\r\n    impossible to proceed, returned home. The Addressers, however,\r\n    did at length reach St. James’s, but the mob threw dirt at the\r\n    gentlemen as they got out of their carriages at St. James’s\r\n    Gate.”\r\n\r\nThe few that reached the palace were so covered with dirt as to be\r\nunpresentable, and those of the courtiers who came within reach of the\r\nmob were also bespattered. The document which was the main cause of\r\nthis disturbance was within an ace of never reaching its destination.\r\n\r\n    “When Mr. Boehm was obliged to get out of his coach at Nando’s\r\n    Coffee-house to avoid the mob, in his hurry he left the address\r\n    under the cushion on one of the seats, and immediately ordered\r\n    the coachman to go home; some of the mob opened the coach door,\r\n    and began to search for the address, but the coachman declaring\r\n    ‘it was sent before’ (though he knew not where it was), they\r\n    were the less diligent in their search, and missed laying hold\r\n    of it, by not feeling six inches farther on the seat.”\r\n\r\nOn the road thither, by the Strand, the additions already mentioned\r\nwere made to the cavalcade, to the consternation of those who formed\r\npart of it:--\r\n\r\n    “When some of the coaches got to Exeter Exchange, a hearse\r\n    came out of Exeter Street, and preceded them, drawn by a black\r\n    and white horse, the driver of which had on a rough coat,\r\n    resembling a skin, with a large cap, one side black, the other\r\n    white, whose whole figure was very grotesque. On one side\r\n    of the hearse was painted on canvas a representation of the\r\n    rioters killing Mr. Clarke at the Brentford election; and on\r\n    the other side was a representation of the soldiers firing on\r\n    young Allen in the cow-house.”\r\n\r\nThe _Town and Country Magazine_ (1769) divulges that the driver of the\r\ndecorated hearse was “a man of fortune;” moreover, another account\r\navers--\r\n\r\n    “I have always understood that the late Lord Mountmorres,\r\n    then a very young man, was the person, who on that occasion,\r\n    personated the executioner [of Charles I. ?], holding an axe\r\n    in his hands, and his face covered with crape.” (See Wraxall’s\r\n    “Historical Memoirs;” also the “Letters of the First Earl of\r\n    Malmesbury,” etc.)\r\n\r\nThe hearse attended the cavalcade, making a short stop at Carlton\r\nHouse, where the Princess of Wales lived, also at the residence of\r\nthe “Cumberland Butcher,” and at Lord Weymouth’s, in Pall Mall (as\r\nthe author of the St. George’s Fields massacre); thence the hearse,\r\nwith its “humiliating insignia, was driven into the court-yard of St.\r\nJames’s, followed by the mob, after which it went off to Albemarle\r\nStreet.” A copy of the address is given in the _Political Register_\r\n(iv. 1769).\r\n\r\nThe address and its supporters were in a sad plight when the levee-room\r\nwas reached, after the foregoing vicissitudes. The Duke of Chandos\r\nwrote Mr. Grenville--\r\n\r\n    “Out of one hundred and thirty merchants who went up with the\r\n    address, only twelve could get to the King, and they were\r\n    covered in dirt, as indeed was almost the whole Court.”\r\n\r\nThe riotous crowd continued to create a disturbance at the palace\r\ngates, “accompanied with threats of a most dangerous kind” (as declared\r\nin the royal proclamation); while the Earl of Malmesbury wrote, “Many\r\nof the mob cried, ‘Wilkes and no King,’ which is shocking to think of.”\r\nAt last, the proclamation against tumultuous assemblies was read, and--\r\n\r\n    “Several persons taken into custody by the soldiers; and two\r\n    were taken by Lord Talbot, who was the only minister who had\r\n    sufficient resolution to come down among the mob; his lordship\r\n    had secured another, who was rescued, and his lordship received\r\n    a violent blow on the head, by being thrown against a coach,\r\n    and then thought it prudent to take shelter among the soldiers.”\r\n\r\nA grand council at St. James’s was held on the afternoon of these\r\nevents, and in the evening a _Gazette Extraordinary_ was published,\r\nwith a proclamation by the king--who had in person witnessed the\r\ndisturbances attending the sham address,--“for suppressing riots,”\r\netc., beginning--\r\n\r\n    “Whereas it has been represented to us that divers dissolute\r\n    and disorderly persons have most riotously and unlawfully\r\n    assembled themselves together, to the disturbance of the\r\n    public peace, and have, in a most daring and audacious manner,\r\n    assaulted several merchants and others, coming to our palace\r\n    at St. James’s, and have committed many acts of violence and\r\n    outrage before the gates of our palace,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation further charges the lord mayor, and justices of the\r\npeace for the cities of London and Westminster, borough of Southwark,\r\nand counties of Middlesex and Surrey, to prevent and suppress all\r\nriots, tumults, and unlawful assemblies, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother engraving on the same topic--as described by Mr. Edward\r\nHawkins, from whose collection, bequeathed to the British Museum, many\r\nof these early illustrations are selected--was entitled:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE GOTHAM ADDRESSERS; OR, A PEEP AT THE HEARSE.”\r\n\r\n    “Sing the Addressers who lately set out\r\n    To flatter the great and honesty rout,\r\n    Where Frenchmen, and Swiss, and Hollanders shy\r\n    United their forces with Charley Dingley,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe procession and hearse (the driver is exclaiming “Wilkes and\r\nLiberty”) are again shown at St. James’s Palace. The chief promoter,\r\nCharles Dingley, is made the principal butt of this satire, and,\r\nas the address began with him, it is appropriately so terminated.\r\nThe hearse with the placards is succeeded by a coach bearing on the\r\nroof a windmill, an allusion to Dingley’s too famous saw-mills at\r\nLimehouse, which were dismantled by the sawyers out of work and other\r\nrioters. The coachman of this equipage is endeavouring to pacify the\r\nmob: “Wilkes and Liberty, Gentlemen; I had no hand in the d----d\r\nAddress.” The chief offender, seen inside the coach, is also appealing\r\nto the incensed crowd: “For God’s sake, Gentlemen, spare me; I wish\r\nthe Address had been in Hell before I meddled with it.” His bemired\r\nfootman is declaring, “My livery’s like my master, d----d Dirty.” The\r\nnext coach has on it a zany with cap and bells, seated “on the Massacre\r\nof Aboyna;” this figure of folly is exclaiming, “I give Mr. Dingle\r\nthe lead;” the rider, one of the loan-contractors and bidders for\r\nministerial favour, cries, “Ayez pitié de moi!” “Dingle’s Downfall, a\r\nnew Song,” is chanted by a female ballad-singer. Dead cats and mud are\r\nthrown at the procession, which is followed by the groans and hisses of\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing events are further elucidated in “A Dialogue between the\r\nTwo Heads on Temple Bar.” The narrator professes to have overheard the\r\nfollowing conversation upon politics between the decapitated heads of\r\nthe 1745 rebels stuck over Temple Bar:--\r\n\r\n    “But soon more surpris’d, and I’ll tell you the cause, sir,\r\n    The heads on Temple Bar were in a deep discourse, sir.\r\n      ‘Why, Fletcher,[55] your head and mine has been fixed hither\r\n    These full twenty years, expos’d to all weather\r\n    For being concerned in a Scottish rebellion:\r\n    Not like Bute, the nation to rob of three million.’\r\n      ‘Ay, Townsend, but Bute play’d the jockey so fair, sir,\r\n    Got the money for riding the old Georgian mare, sir,\r\n    But his tricks at St. James’s Wilkes soon did disclose, sir,\r\n    Tho’ squint-ey’d, saw how Bute led the King by the nose, sir.’\r\n      ‘Why, Fletcher, that’s worse than open rebellion!\r\n    And here’s room on the Bar if they would but behead him;\r\n    In St. George’s Fields there’s room for a gibbet,\r\n    But justice of late, they don’t choose to exhibit.\r\n    If justice took place, ’twould cause Jack some trouble,\r\n    Lord Mansfield himself, might, by chance, mount the scaffold.\r\n    No more alt’ring records; but this joke might be said,\r\n    As blind with the scales, he appears without head.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And half a score more, tuck’d up in a halter;\r\n    But don’t forget to hang Luttrell and Proctor,\r\n    For ’tis such rogues as these that corrupted the nation,\r\n    And caus’d these disturbances, strife, and vexation.\r\n    Then the King would be freed from all of roguish party,\r\n    And let those fill their places who are loyal and hearty.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPETITIONS AND REMONSTRANCES TO THE THRONE, 1769-70.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitions and remonstrances began to make ministers tremble lest\r\nfinally the sympathies of the throne might be turned into the proper\r\nchannel, and the king be led to espouse the cause of the people, who,\r\nto do them justice, remained loyal under both the critical emergencies\r\ndescribed as occurring under Charles II. and George III., and which had\r\nmore than a casual resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances of the citizens were persistently laid before the\r\nking, although every obstacle was interposed in the way of their\r\npresentation by petty indignities imposed upon those bold enough to\r\napproach the presence with objects thus distasteful to the royal ideas\r\nof sovereign right--\r\n\r\n    “Make prayers not so like petitions\r\n    As overtures and propositions.”\r\n\r\n  (_Hudibras._)\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1769, the Livery of London presented a petition to the king;\r\nthe lord mayor, Samuel Turner, Sir Robert Ladbrooke,[56] Alderman\r\nBeckford, and other friends of popular liberty being charged with this\r\nstatement of grievances, of which the following extracts must suffice:--\r\n\r\n    “We should be wanting in our duty to your Majesty, as well as\r\n    to ourselves and our posterity, should we forbear to represent\r\n    to the throne the desperate attempts that have been, and are\r\n    too successfully, made to destroy that constitution to the\r\n    spirit of which we owe the relation which subsists between your\r\n    Majesty and the subjects of these realms, and to subvert those\r\n    sacred laws which our ancestors have sealed with their blood.\r\n\r\n    “Your ministers, from corrupt principles and in violation of\r\n    every duty, have, by various enumerated means, invaded our\r\n    invaluable and inalienable right of trial by jury.\r\n\r\n    “They have, with impunity, issued general warrants, and\r\n    violently seized persons and private papers.\r\n\r\n    “They have rendered the laws non-effective to our security, by\r\n    invading the Habeas Corpus.\r\n\r\n    “They have caused punishments and even perpetual imprisonment\r\n    to be inflicted, without trial, conviction, or sentence.\r\n\r\n    “They have brought into disrepute the civil magistracy, by the\r\n    appointment of persons who are, in many respects, unqualified\r\n    for that important trust, and have thereby purposely furnished\r\n    a pretence for calling in the aid of the military power.\r\n\r\n    “They avow, and endeavour to establish, a maxim absolutely\r\n    inconsistent with our constitution, that ‘an occasion for\r\n    effectually employing a military force always presents itself,\r\n    when the civil power is trifled with or insulted;’ and by a\r\n    fatal and false application of this maxim, they have wantonly\r\n    and wickedly sacrificed the lives of many of your Majesty’s\r\n    innocent subjects, and have prostituted your Majesty’s sacred\r\n    name and authority, to justify, applaud, and recommend their\r\n    own illegal and bloody actions.\r\n\r\n    “They have screened more than one murderer from punishment, and\r\n    in its place have unnaturally substituted reward.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “And after having insulted and defeated the law on different\r\n    occasions, and by different contrivances, both at home and\r\n    abroad, they have at length completed their design, by\r\n    violently wresting from the people the _last sacred right\r\n    we had left_, the right of election, by the unprecedented\r\n    seating of a candidate notoriously set up and chosen only by\r\n    themselves. They have thereby taken from your subjects all\r\n    hopes of parliamentary redress, and have left us no resource,\r\n    under God, but in your Majesty.\r\n\r\n    “All this they have been able to effect by corruption; by\r\n    a scandalous misapplication and embezzlement of the public\r\n    treasure, and a shameful prostitution of public honours and\r\n    employments; procuring deficiencies of the civil lists to be\r\n    made good without examinations; and, instead of punishing,\r\n    conferring honours on a paymaster, the public defaulter of\r\n    unaccounted millions.\r\n\r\n    “From an unfeigned sense of the duty we owe to your Majesty,\r\n    and to our country, we have ventured thus humbly to lay before\r\n    the throne these great and important truths, which it has been\r\n    the business of your Ministers to conceal. We most earnestly\r\n    beseech your Majesty to grant us redress. It is for the purpose\r\n    of redress alone, and for such occasions as the present,\r\n    that those great and extensive powers are entrusted to the\r\n    Crown by the wisdom of that Constitution which your Majesty’s\r\n    illustrious family was chosen to defend, and which we trust in\r\n    God it will for ever continue to support.”\r\n\r\nOf each paragraph given in the foregoing the meaning was conclusive,\r\nthe instance known to all. There is in this petition no statement\r\nexaggerated, no sentiment overcoloured, considering that one paragraph\r\nalone describes no less than the suicidal measures which dismembered\r\nthe empire, and cost the mother country the allegiance of “the\r\ncolonies,” _i.e._ the continent of America, in these plain words:--\r\n\r\n    “They [the Grafton administration] have established numberless\r\n    unconstitutional regulations and taxations in our colonies.\r\n    They have caused a revenue to be raised in some of them by\r\n    prerogative.”\r\n\r\nHowever meritorious the cause, it was an offence to a king whose mind,\r\nnever remarkable for lucidity, was then under “the influence of the\r\nworst of counsellors,” as stated in the first prayer of the petition.\r\nThe document--when the petitioners were, after much discouragement,\r\ndelay, and many subterfuges, and, “although no time could be fixed for\r\nits acceptance,” permitted to approach the presence at a levee--was\r\nat last presented; but the king made no reply, but, handing the\r\npetition to the lord-in-waiting, turned his back on the presenters,\r\nwho represented the integrity and commercial greatness of the city of\r\nLondon and were its elected guardians, and addressed Baron Dieden, the\r\nDanish ambassador, who was standing in his vicinity, on an indifferent\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\nAfter the late fulsome reception of “bogus addressers” nothing could\r\nbe more contemptible than the studied impertinence with which the\r\nCorporation of London was treated, and the affront of leaving the civil\r\nmagistrate to\r\n\r\n    “skulk about the passages of the Court that he may have a\r\n    glimpse of His Majesty as he passes along in state, in order\r\n    to deliver into his hands a remonstrance affecting the most\r\n    essential interests of above twelve millions of people, who by\r\n    the sweat of their brow support the pomp and parade of royalty\r\n    and swell the fastidious pride and coxcombical vanity of empty\r\n    courtiers.”\r\n\r\nIt was boldly hazarded at this emergency, from the premeditated affront\r\nto the representatives alike of the city and the people, that the\r\nrulers, blinded to their own destruction, then concluded--\r\n\r\n    “themselves sufficiently prepared for the final extirpation of\r\n    liberty in this island, and that by deliberate insults they\r\n    were urging the people to commit some outrage, which might\r\n    give them a pretence for putting their scheme of tyranny into\r\n    immediate execution.”\r\n\r\nIf the city, by its dignified and law-abiding demeanour, disappointed\r\nthese expectations, it was argued that the Court party would not\r\nwait for an excuse to wreak their vengeance under some thin disguise\r\nof retributive justice, but would proceed to order out the “Scotch\r\nRegiment, as in the affair of St. George’s Fields, without waiting for\r\nthe least appearance of necessity.”\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Oxford Magazine_, writing under the signature\r\n“Philopolis,” referring to the threatened massacres in St. George’s\r\nFields, and, on the grounds that the late firing did comparatively\r\nlittle damage to the rioters concerned, declared:--\r\n\r\n    “I have heard it indeed alleged by courtiers in excuse, that\r\n    all the military execution of that day was solely aimed at\r\n    Mr. Wilkes, who they hoped would be despatched by some lucky\r\n    shot, as Herod expected our Saviour would be murdered among\r\n    the innocents he murdered at Bethlehem. As a proof of this\r\n    extenuation of the crime, they show flatted balls, which were\r\n    discharged by heroes planted in proper places for the purpose,\r\n    and which have left marks in the walls about the windows of\r\n    Mr. Wilkes’s apartments in the King’s Bench.” “If this has any\r\n    foundation in truth,” writes “Philopolis,” “I would advise\r\n    the city to be cautious, and never allow above a dozen of its\r\n    inhabitants to be seen together at one time, for fear the Riot\r\n    Act should arrive unexpectedly, with two or three brigades of\r\n    musqueteers, headed by a trading justice, who may think nothing\r\n    of the citizens’ lives, provided he has any hopes of murdering\r\n    Beckford and the two sheriffs through their sides.”\r\n\r\nThe petition presented by the lord mayor with such difficulty, and\r\nafter many insolent subterfuges and repulses, failed to bring the king\r\nto a reasonable sense of his situation or of the dangers to which the\r\nthrone was exposed by the reckless and unconstitutional conduct of the\r\nadministration. Subsequently, on the presentation of a “remonstrance,”\r\nthe king returned a written reply to the original petition, visiting\r\nwith severe censure the persevering claim of invaded birthrights, urged\r\nby “the afflicted citizens,” and treating their just grievances with\r\nreprimand instead of redress; the pleas set forth in the petitions\r\nbeing considered by His Majesty “as disrespectful to himself, injurious\r\nto his parliament, and irreconcileable to the principles of the\r\nconstitution”--a piece of bold duplicity more worthy of the Stuart\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nThe vexed question of Middlesex election, the imprisonment of Wilkes,\r\nthe unconstitutional admission of Luttrell into the House, and\r\nparticularly the supineness of the King to the petitions and just\r\nremonstrances of his people, are embodied in a metrical form, as--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A NEW SONG; BEING A POETICAL PETITION TO THE KING.\r\n\r\n    “Good Sir, I crave pity, bad is my condition:\r\n    You’ve sworn to relieve me, as I understand;\r\n    To tell you the whole, pray read this Petition;\r\n    My name you know is Old England:\r\n    Tho’ you’ve receiv’d many, and not answer’d any,\r\n    I hope Old England’s will not be forgot,\r\n    For if you deny me, the land will despise ye--\r\n    ’Twas King Charles the First by the axe went to pot.\r\n    My right arm is wounded, and Middlesex county\r\n    I always esteem’d the bloom of my plumb.\r\n    And murd’rers have got a pardon and bounty,\r\n    From this precious arm they have torn a thumb;\r\n    For Wilkes is took from me, such wrongs have they done me,\r\n    They’ve alter’d records unto their disgrace;\r\n    ’Tis thus that they’ve done, and a bastard son,\r\n    While my darling’s in prison, now sits in his place.\r\n    My head is wounded, if such a thing can be,\r\n    My troubles are such that I can take no rest;\r\n    Two sons are ta’en from me, Great Camden and Granby,\r\n    And to the world they have left me distrest:\r\n    For Granby’s a soldier, none better or bolder,\r\n    And Camden’s a lawyer in justice well known,\r\n    In law had such power, took Wilkes from the Tower,\r\n    These, these are the children I ne’er will disown.\r\n    So read my Petition, good Sir; ’tis not tattle,\r\n    But matter of consequence, you’ll understand;\r\n    And answer me not, Sir, about horned cattle,\r\n    Pray what’s a few beasts, to the peace of the land?\r\n    The land has been injur’d, our rights they’ve infringed,\r\n    And loud for redress it behoves us to call,\r\n    For should we let trespass, like an indolent ass,\r\n    With Middlesex then all our rights they must fall.\r\n    Our land it is ruled by rogues, roughs, and bullies,\r\n    In the nation’s confusion they go hand in hand,\r\n    Sharps, gamblers, profuse and extravagant cullies,\r\n    A very odd set for to govern the land:\r\n    Here’s Bute, we hear, dying, his mistress for him crying,\r\n    Her son he has learnt the same fiddle to play;\r\n    For he touches the string, in disgrace to the king,\r\n    But his mother has taught him--why what?--shall we say?”\r\n\r\nIn the March of the year following, after awaiting a response for\r\nnearly twelve months, the Livery of the city resolved to draw up a\r\nfurther and more stringent remonstrance; and a meeting was held under\r\nthe Right Hon. William Beckford, elected lord mayor for the second\r\ntime, in the interval. In his address “to the Supreme Court of the\r\nwhole City,” the real dangers which menaced the State were by Beckford\r\ntraced to their true source, “the comprehensive violation of the _right\r\nof election_”--\r\n\r\n    “to preserve which right, the Crown had been justly taken from\r\n    James the Second, and been placed by the people of England on\r\n    the head of William the Third, and conferred on His Majesty’s\r\n    family. That the corruption of the people’s representatives was\r\n    the cause and foundation of all our grievances. That we have\r\n    now only the name of a parliament, without the substance.”\r\n\r\nHe observed how improper it was for _placemen_ and _pensioners_ to sit\r\nin the House of Commons; “for if a man was not fit to be a Juryman,\r\nor a Judge in a cause where he was interested, how much less to be a\r\nSenator and justify his peculation.” “_He complained of the unequal\r\nand inadequate representation of the people, by means of the little,\r\nrotten, paltry boroughs._” In the remonstrance drawn up on this\r\noccasion, the wrongs of the people were again eloquently urged, and\r\nit was especially pointed out that the House of Commons, by the venal\r\nmajority--\r\n\r\n    “had deprived the people of their dearest rights. They have\r\n    done a deed more ruinous in its consequence than the levying\r\n    of ship-money by Charles the First, or the dispensing power\r\n    assumed by James the Second. A deed which must vitiate all the\r\n    future proceedings of this parliament; for the acts of the\r\n    legislature itself can no more be valid without a legal House\r\n    of Commons than without a legal prince upon the throne.\r\n\r\n    “Representatives of the people are essential to the making of\r\n    laws, and there is a time when it is morally demonstrable that\r\n    men cease to be representatives. That time is now arrived. The\r\n    present House of Commons do not represent the people. We owe to\r\n    your Majesty an obedience under the restriction of the laws,\r\n    for the calling and duration of Parliaments; and your Majesty\r\n    owes to us, that our representation, free from the force of\r\n    arms or corruption, should be preserved to us in them.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “The forms of the Constitution, like those of Religion, were\r\n    not established for form’s sake, but for the substance. And\r\n    we call God and man to witness that we do not owe our Liberty\r\n    to those nice and subtle distinctions, which _places_, and\r\n    _pensions_, and _lucrative employments_ have invented; so\r\n    neither will we be cheated of it by them, but as it was gained\r\n    by the stern virtue of our ancestors, by the virtue of their\r\n    descendants it shall be preserved.\r\n\r\n    “Since, therefore, the misdeeds of your Majesty’s ministers\r\n    in violating the freedom of Election, and depraving the\r\n    noble constitution of Parliaments are notorious, as well as\r\n    subversive of the fundamental Laws and Liberties of this\r\n    Realm; and since your Majesty, both in honour and justice,\r\n    is obliged inviolably to preserve them according to the Oath\r\n    made to God and your subjects at your Coronation; we, your\r\n    remonstrants, assure ourselves that your Majesty will restore\r\n    the constitutional Government and quiet of your people, by\r\n    DISSOLVING this Parliament, and removing those evil\r\n    ministers FOR EVER from your councils.”\r\n\r\nThis manly and righteous remonstrance was presented after many\r\npettifogging slights and indignities, vexations, and subterfuges on\r\nthe part of the Court and Crown; and there were made various attempts\r\nto bring into discredit the authenticity of this document as the\r\nexpression of the Court of Aldermen. The Corporation of the city, in\r\nsixty carriages, proceeded with the various officers to the palace\r\nof St. James’s, and were received by the king on his throne. The\r\nremonstrance was read; and, in reply, His Majesty read an answer, drawn\r\nup in advance, condemning both the former petition and the present\r\nremonstrance in unmistakable terms, and ending with an assurance\r\nthat “he had ever made the law of the land the rule of his conduct,\r\nesteeming it his chief glory to rule over a free people;” and then,\r\ndescending into more palpable falsehoods, asserting, in the face of\r\nfacts, with a power of dissimulation worthy of Charles II:--\r\n\r\n    “with this view I have always been careful, as well to\r\n    execute faithfully the trust reposed in me, as to avoid even\r\n    the appearance of invading any of those powers which the\r\n    Constitution has placed in other hands.”\r\n\r\nThe king was evidently the puppet of more vicious minds, being blessed\r\nwith but a feeble reasoning faculty of his own. After reading his\r\nequivocative answer, and as the lord mayor and the city representatives\r\nwere withdrawing, the vacuity of his intellect made itself\r\nmanifest--for it is asserted in contemporaneous accounts, “His Majesty\r\ninstantly turned round to his courtiers, and _burst out laughing_.\r\nNERO FIDDLED WHILE ROME WAS BURNING.”\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded to these petitions being far from such as their\r\ngravity demanded, fresh agitations commenced in the metropolis and in\r\nthe provinces, and, on March 30th, Horne Tooke delivered a remarkable\r\naddress to the freeholders of the county of Middlesex, in which he\r\ngraphically described both the murders he had seen committed and\r\nthe conduct of the justices of the peace, who said the ministerial\r\ninstructions were for the soldiers to fire, and referred to the\r\npartiality shown on the trials and the defences made at the expense\r\nof Government when it was endeavoured to bring the guilty to justice.\r\nAt this meeting, “An Address, Remonstrance, and Petition of the\r\nFreeholders of Middlesex” was drawn up for presentation, in which it\r\nwas urged on the king--\r\n\r\n    “that a secret and malignant influence had thwarted and\r\n    defeated almost every measure which had been attempted for the\r\n    benefit of his subjects, and had given rise to measures totally\r\n    subversive of the Liberties and Constitution of these once\r\n    flourishing and happy kingdoms.”\r\n\r\n    “It is not for any light or common grievances that we presume\r\n    thus repeatedly to interrupt your Majesty’s quiet with our\r\n    complaints. It is not the illegal oppression of an individual;\r\n    it is not the partial invasion of our property; it is not\r\n    the violation of any single law of which we complain, but it\r\n    is a violation which at one stroke deprives us of the only\r\n    constitutional security of our Fortunes, Liberties, and Lives.\r\n\r\n    “Your Majesty’s servants have attacked our Liberties in the\r\n    most vital part; they have torn away the heart-strings of the\r\n    Constitution, and have made those men our destruction, whom the\r\n    laws have appointed as the immediate guardians of our Rights\r\n    and Liberties.\r\n\r\n    “The House of Commons, by their determination at the last\r\n    election for this county, have assumed a power to overrule\r\n    at pleasure the fundamental _Right of Election_, which the\r\n    Constitution has placed in other hands, those of their\r\n    Constituents, and from whence alone their whole authority\r\n    is derived; a power by which the law of the land is at once\r\n    overturned and resolved into the will and pleasure of a\r\n    majority of one House of Parliament. And if this pretended\r\n    power is exercised to the full extent of the principles, that\r\n    House can no longer be a Representative of the people, but a\r\n    separate body, altogether independent of them, self-existing,\r\n    and self-elected.\r\n\r\n    “These proceedings have totally destroyed the confidence\r\n    of your Majesty’s subjects in one essential branch of the\r\n    legislative power, and if that branch is chosen in a manner\r\n    not agreeable to the laws and constitution of the kingdom, the\r\n    authority of Parliament itself must suffer extremely, if not\r\n    totally perish.”\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance from which the above paragraphs are extracted was,\r\ntogether with a petition from the county of Kent, presented to His\r\nMajesty at St. James’s; both being received and handed to the lord of\r\nthe bedchamber in waiting; _but no answer was returned_.\r\n\r\nThe electors of the city of Westminster also drew up a similar\r\n“Address, Remonstrance, and Petition”--\r\n\r\n    “their former application to the throne having been\r\n    ineffectual, and new and exorbitant grievances being beyond\r\n    patient endurance. By the same secret and unhappy influence\r\n    to which all our grievances have been originally owing, the\r\n    redress of those grievances has been now prevented; and the\r\n    grievances themselves have been repeatedly confirmed; with\r\n    this additional circumstance of aggravation, that while the\r\n    invaders of our rights remain the directors of your Majesty’s\r\n    councils, the defenders of those rights have been dismissed\r\n    from your Majesty’s service--your Majesty having been advised\r\n    by your ministers to remove from his employment, for his vote\r\n    in Parliament, the highest officer of the Law (Lord Camden),\r\n    because his principles suited ill with theirs, and his pure\r\n    distribution of justice with their corrupt administration of\r\n    the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n    “We beg leave, therefore, again to represent to your Majesty\r\n    that the House of Commons have struck at the most valuable\r\n    liberties and franchises of all the electors of Great Britain;\r\n    and by assuming to themselves a right of choosing, instead\r\n    of receiving a member when chosen, and by transferring to\r\n    the representative what belonged to the constituent, they\r\n    have taken off from the dignity, and, we fear, impaired the\r\n    authority of Parliament itself.\r\n\r\n    “We presume again, therefore, humbly to implore from your\r\n    Majesty the only remedies which are in any way proportioned to\r\n    the nature of the evil; that you would be graciously pleased\r\n    to dismiss _for ever_ from your councils those ministers who\r\n    are ill-suited by their dispositions to preserve the principles\r\n    of a free, or by their capacities to direct the councils of\r\n    a great and mighty kingdom; And that by speedily dissolving\r\n    the present Parliament, your Majesty will show by your own\r\n    example, and by their dissolution, the rights of your people\r\n    are to be inviolable, and that you will never necessitate so\r\n    many injured, and, by such treatment, exasperated subjects, to\r\n    continue the care of their interests to those from whom they\r\n    must withdraw their confidence; to repose their invaluable\r\n    privileges in the hand of those who have sacrificed them; and\r\n    their trust in those who have betrayed it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “We find ourselves compelled to urge, with the greatest\r\n    importunity, this our humble but earnest application, as\r\n    every day seems to produce the confirmation of some old, or\r\n    to threaten the introduction of some new injury. We have the\r\n    strongest reason to apprehend that the usurpation begun by the\r\n    House of Commons upon the right of electing, may be extended\r\n    to the right of petitioning, and that under the pretence of\r\n    restraining the abuse of this right, it is meant to bring into\r\n    disrepute, and to intimidate us from the exercise of the right\r\n    itself.”\r\n\r\nThe representatives elected by the people had done their utmost, as\r\nrespected the venal majority, to betray their trust and those who\r\nhad sent them to the Commons. Resistance was countenanced, and, by\r\ncounter-addresses to the throne, the king was prejudiced against\r\nlistening to the wishes of the people. This remonstrance elicited his\r\nMajesty’s reply “_that he would lay it before his Parliament_;” a\r\ncurious conclusion, inasmuch as his afflicted subjects specially prayed\r\ntherein that the king would be their safeguard against the majority\r\nin that body, who had betrayed the nation, and to the deliberation of\r\nthat corrupted assembly the complaint--which affected the duration of\r\nthe House--was to be submitted for redress! The remonstrance, which\r\nresembled an impeachment of the administration, was, in fact, handed\r\nto the ministers under accusation, to be by them resisted, prosecuted,\r\nor rendered ineffective at their discretion. The indignant judgments\r\nenunciated by “Junius” against these unprincipled politicians, foes to\r\nthe kingdom, have been abundantly confirmed by the verdict of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe reception otherwise accorded to the Westminster remonstrance was\r\naltogether undignified. When the deputation, headed by Sir Robert\r\nBernard, who had been returned member for that city by the unanimous\r\nsuffrage of the constituency, arrived at the palace gate, an extra\r\nguard of soldiers was immediately turned out, not, however, as a\r\ncompliment, for--\r\n\r\n    “although there was not the least appearance of anything\r\n    disorderly, yet the soldiers behaved in a most insolent\r\n    manner, and struck many persons with their bayonets, and that\r\n    without provocation. The Gentlemen having alighted from their\r\n    carriages, amidst the acclamations of the people, walked\r\n    through the lane of soldiers, and went upstairs to the Levee\r\n    Room door, where they were met by one of the Grooms of the\r\n    Bedchamber, who asked Sir Robert Bernard if he had anything\r\n    to present to his Majesty? To which Sir Robert replied,\r\n    ‘Yes, the Address, Remonstrance, and Petition of the City\r\n    of Westminster.’ Upon which the Groom of the Bedchamber\r\n    said, ‘He would go and acquaint the Lord-in-Waiting.’ He\r\n    went immediately, but not returning soon, Sir Robert Bernard\r\n    proposed to go into the Levee Room, which he did. On opening\r\n    the door, the same Groom of the Bedchamber said he could\r\n    not find the Lord-in-Waiting; but should soon. However, the\r\n    Gentlemen went on, and after some time the Lord-in-Waiting\r\n    came to them, and said, if they had anything to deliver to\r\n    his Majesty, he would receive it in the next room, whither\r\n    they accordingly went; and after some time, his Majesty coming\r\n    into the room, Sir Robert presented the Remonstrance open. His\r\n    Majesty delivered it to the Lord-in-Waiting, who delivered it\r\n    to another, who handed it to the Groom of the Bedchamber, and\r\n    he carried it off.”\r\n\r\nThe recreant majority of the Commons, still at the bidding of degraded\r\nministers, continued to address the king with counter-petitions\r\nintended to bring into disrepute the remonstrances of the people--those\r\nvery constituents who had chosen them as the defenders of their\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nFinally, another effort was made by the city, and a general assembly\r\nwas held for that purpose, when the chief magistrate, the Court of\r\nAldermen, and Common Council resolved to renew their petition, and\r\nfurther to consider the king’s “answer.”\r\n\r\n    “A motion was then made, that the thanks of this Court be given\r\n    to Lord Chatham for his late conduct in Parliament, and for\r\n    his zeal shown for the most sacred Rights of Election and of\r\n    petitioning, and for the promise of his endeavours to support\r\n    an independent and more equal representation.”\r\n\r\nOn a motion denouncing the most unbecoming treatment which the city\r\nof London had of late experienced from his Majesty’s ministers, it\r\nwas suggested to draw up the strongest remonstrance possible on the\r\nviolated right of election. Upon which, Alderman Wilkes, remarking upon\r\nthe peculiar delicacy of his situation, said--\r\n\r\n    “that he would not mention a syllable about the person\r\n    excluded; but if the House of Commons could seat any gentlemen\r\n    among them who was not chosen by the people, the constitution\r\n    was torn up by the roots, and the people had lost their share\r\n    in the legislative power; that the disabling any person from\r\n    sitting in Parliament, who was not disqualified by law, was an\r\n    injury to every County, City, and Borough, and a dissolution of\r\n    the form of government established by law in this Kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThe recorder cavilled at certain spirited expressions in the drawing-up\r\nof the remonstrance, particularly respecting the king’s answer, which\r\nhe declared could not be considered an act of the ministers, but must\r\nbe held to be the king’s personally. The committee was shocked at the\r\nrecorder’s bringing home to the king one of the most unconstitutional\r\nacts of his ministry, and without one dissentient voice determined\r\nto overrule the objection of the recorder, whereon this functionary\r\nprotested against the remonstrance in strong terms as a LIBEL.\r\nAlderman Wilkes then rose and mentioned his unwillingness to speak\r\nagain, but he was forced to it by the recorder’s declaration that the\r\nremonstrance was a libel; that he too claimed to know something of\r\nthe nature of a libel; that he did not speak from theory only, but\r\nhad bought much experience on that subject; that the remonstrance was\r\nfounded throughout on known and glaring facts, every word bearing the\r\nstamp of truth; that the particular act complained of in the violated\r\nright of election was a malicious and wilful act of the majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons, for the minister had declared, that “if any person\r\nhad only four votes for Middlesex, he should be the sitting member for\r\nthe county!” The lord mayor, Beckford, confirmed Wilkes’s assertion,\r\nconcluding, “I was then present in the House of Commons.”\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance was accordingly presented; in it astonishment was\r\nexpressed at the censure lately passed by the throne upon the faithful\r\nand afflicted citizens, laying their complaints and injuries at the\r\nfeet of their Sovereign, as the father of his people, able and willing\r\nto redress their grievances.\r\n\r\nThe concluding paragraph was very much to the purpose, and displayed no\r\ndiminution of firmness:--\r\n\r\n    “Your Majesty cannot disapprove that we here assert the\r\n    clearest principles of the constitution against the insidious\r\n    attempts of evil counsellors to perplex, confound, and shake\r\n    them. We are determined to abide by those rights and liberties,\r\n    which our forefathers bravely vindicated, at the ever-memorable\r\n    Revolution, and which their sons will ever resolutely defend.\r\n    We therefore now renew, at the foot of the throne, our claim\r\n    to the indispensable right of the subject--a full, free, and\r\n    unmutilated Parliament, legally chosen in all its members;\r\n    a right which this House of Parliament have manifestly\r\n    violated, depriving, at their will and pleasure, the county of\r\n    Middlesex of one of its legal representatives, and arbitrarily\r\n    nominating, as a Knight of the Shire, a person not elected\r\n    by a majority of the freeholders. As the only constitutional\r\n    means of reparation now left for the injured electors of Great\r\n    Britain, we implore, with most urgent supplications, the\r\n    dissolution of the present parliament, the removal of evil\r\n    ministers, and the total extinction of that fatal influence\r\n    which has caused such national discontent.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime, Sire, we offer our constant prayers to\r\n    Heaven, that your Majesty may reign, as Kings only can reign,\r\n    in and by the hearts of a loyal, dutiful, and free people.”\r\n\r\nTo this remonstrance the king’s answer was:--\r\n\r\n    “I should have been wanting to the public as well as to myself,\r\n    if I had not expressed my dissatisfaction at the late Address.\r\n    My sentiments on that subject continue the same; and I should\r\n    ill deserve to be considered as the father of my people, if I\r\n    could suffer myself to be prevailed upon to make such an use\r\n    of my prerogative as I cannot but think inconsistent with the\r\n    interest and dangerous to the constitution of the kingdom.”\r\n\r\nAfter His Majesty had been pleased to make the foregoing answer, the\r\nlord mayor requested leave to reply, which, being granted, Beckford\r\nmade the dignified and noble response which is a matter of history:--\r\n\r\n    (“If worth allures thee, think how Beckford shone\r\n      Who dar’d to utter Truths before the throne.”)\r\n\r\n    “Most Gracious Sovereign--Will your Majesty be pleased so\r\n    far to condescend as to permit the Mayor of your loyal City\r\n    of London to declare in your Royal presence, on behalf of\r\n    his fellow-citizens, how much the bare apprehension of your\r\n    Majesty’s displeasure would at all times affect their minds.\r\n    The declaration of that displeasure has already filled them\r\n    with inexpressible anxiety, and with the deepest affliction.\r\n\r\n    “Permit me, Sire, to assure your Majesty that your Majesty has\r\n    not in all your dominions any subjects more faithful, more\r\n    dutiful, or more affectionate to your Majesty’s person and\r\n    family, or more ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in\r\n    the maintenance of the true honour and dignity of your Crown.\r\n\r\n    “We do, therefore, with the greatest humility and submission,\r\n    most earnestly supplicate your Majesty, that you will not\r\n    dismiss us from your presence without expressing a more\r\n    favourable opinion of your faithful citizens, and without some\r\n    comfort, without some prospect at least of redress.\r\n\r\n    “Permit me, Sire, further to observe, that whoever has already\r\n    dared, or shall hereafter endeavour by false insinuations\r\n    and suggestions, to alienate your Majesty’s affections from\r\n    your loyal subjects in general and from the city of London in\r\n    particular, and to withdraw your confidence in and regard for\r\n    your people, is an enemy to your Majesty’s person and family,\r\n    a violator of the public peace, and a betrayer of our happy\r\n    Constitution, as it was established at the glorious revolution\r\n    of 1688.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these expressions of enlightenment for the royal\r\nmind, the lord mayor waited more than a minute for a reply of “some\r\nmore favourable opinion,” but none was given.\r\n\r\n“On this occasion,” says the satirist, “Nero did _not_ fiddle while\r\nRome was burning.” The humility and serious firmness with which the\r\ndignified Beckford--who enjoyed the friendship of the great Earl of\r\nChatham, and with whom he had many points in common--uttered these\r\nwords, “filled the whole Court with admiration and confusion;” for\r\nthey found very different countenances amongst the citizens than they\r\nexpected from Lord Pomfret’s description, who declared in the House of\r\nLords--\r\n\r\n    “that, however swaggering and impudent the behaviour of the low\r\n    citizens might be on their own dunghill, when they came into\r\n    the royal presence, their heads hung down like bulrushes, and\r\n    they blinked with their eyes like owls in the sunshine of the\r\n    sun.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of May, the king prorogued that parliament which, by\r\napproving addresses from both Houses, had fortified the royal censure\r\nreturned to the popular remonstrances. “The prevalence of animosities\r\nand of dissensions among their fellow-subjects” was specially alluded\r\nto in his Majesty’s speech, while the conduct of both branches of his\r\nlegislature received in return such flattering encomiums as their\r\nservile pliability had earned by despicable means:--\r\n\r\n    “The _temper_ with which you have conducted all your\r\n    proceedings has given me great satisfaction, and I promise\r\n    myself the happiest effects from the firmness, as well as the\r\n    moderation, which you have manifested in the very _critical_\r\n    circumstances which have attended your late deliberations.”\r\n\r\nHowever undignified the reception accorded at the time to these\r\npetitions addressed to the throne from its truest supporters, the\r\ngood cause eventually triumphed, in defiance of the chicanery of\r\ncounter-expressions of servility, fabricated at the instance of\r\nthose whose prospects depended on the continuance in power of false\r\npoliticians, despising alike the voice and interests of the people, and\r\nresting their reliance on the venality of their adherents, and the base\r\ninstinct of self-aggrandisement at the expense of the state existent in\r\nminds equally mercenary with their own.\r\n\r\n    “Eventually the citizens succeeded, in spite of the united\r\n    efforts of the Court, the Ministers, and the Parliament; and\r\n    their cause has since been solemnly and universally recognized\r\n    as that of the Constitution and of liberty. It is impossible to\r\n    appreciate too highly the national importance of the conduct\r\n    they pursued.”\r\n\r\nIt was well said by “Junius,” the integrity of whose sentiments bears\r\nmore than a casual resemblance to the utterances of that patriotic\r\nstatesman, Lord Chatham, with whose fame the authorship of Junius’s\r\n“Letters” may one day be identified:--\r\n\r\n    “The noble spirit of the metropolis is the life-blood of\r\n    the state, collected at the heart; from that point it\r\n    circulates with health and vigour through every artery of the\r\n    Constitution.”\r\n\r\nThe great Chatham and his friend, William Beckford, stand out\r\nconspicuous from their fellow-men in association with that corrupt\r\ntime when statescraft was for the most part a question of ability for\r\ndebasing the largest number on the easiest terms contrivable; they\r\nlived at a time when liberty ran especial risks, and, as champions of\r\npopular rights, proved worthy of those emergencies with which they\r\nwere confronted. In days when the chief magistrate of the city may\r\ndegenerate to a subservient courtier, the history of Beckford’s firm\r\nattitude may be regarded as no longer the worthiest part of the civic\r\ntraditions. That his fellow-citizens appreciated his exertions is shown\r\nby the thanks he received for his able and dignified speech to the\r\nking; his reply was ordered to be inserted in the city records, and\r\nafterwards, at his death, was inscribed on the monument erected in the\r\nGuildhall to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe blow struck at a corrupt administration by the Westminster and\r\nother remonstrances seems to have damped the ardour of the ministers;\r\nin any case, no Court candidate was put forward for Westminster\r\nin 1770, and consequently the election of a liberal candidate was\r\nunopposed.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, at noon, came on at St. Paul’s, Covent Garden,\r\nthe election of a representative in parliament for the City and\r\nLiberty of Westminster, in the room of the Hon. Edwin Sandys, created\r\nLord Sandys. A considerable number of the electors assembled early\r\nin the morning at the “Standard Tavern” in Leicester Fields; and\r\nproceeded from thence with a band of music, etc., in procession\r\nthrough Piccadilly to the residence of Sir Robert Bernard, in Hamilton\r\nStreet. When they came to Covent Garden, the whole square was full.\r\nProclamation of silence being made, Sir John Hussey Delaval, Bart.,\r\naddressing himself to the people, said--\r\n\r\n    “he rejoiced to see such a prodigious number of the Electors\r\n    present, to support the nomination in Westminster Hall the\r\n    previous Thursday; that Sir Robert Bernard had stood forward in\r\n    support of the rights of the people in their just complaints\r\n    against the late flagrant violation of their liberties; and\r\n    concluded with observing, that they were come to confirm with\r\n    their votes this their free and glorious choice.”\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Mountmorres seconded the motion in a spirited speech, in\r\nwhich he stated--\r\n\r\n    “the services and principles of Sir Robert Bernard; the\r\n    grievances under which the people laboured; the great violation\r\n    of their rights in the case of Middlesex; the impossibility\r\n    that any king, that any parliament, that the courts of\r\n    justice, or that all together, could annihilate the people’s\r\n    constitutional rights.”\r\n\r\nThese speeches were received with acclamation by the twenty thousand\r\npeople present, amongst whom strict good order was preserved.\r\n\r\nThe proper proclamations being made, and no other candidate appearing,\r\nthe return was signed by the gentlemen present on the hustings.\r\nThe election being entirely over, the gentlemen retired into the\r\nvestry-room, where the indenture was signed by them, and finally\r\nreturned to the Crown Office. On the day following, Sir Robert Bernard\r\nwas introduced into the House of Commons by the Hon. Henry Grenville\r\nand William Pulteney, and took his seat as member for Westminster. The\r\nWestminster returns being generally looked upon with interest by other\r\nconstituencies, this election was held out as a proper example to every\r\ncity in the kingdom, and to all the counties and towns, to choose their\r\nmembers with a spirit of freedom and without expense. It was resolved\r\nby the freeholders of Westminster, in advance--\r\n\r\n    “that if this election had been contested, it would not\r\n    have cost Sir Robert Bernard a shilling, the electors being\r\n    determined to support their free choice.”\r\n\r\nThis particular return is a case in point, which goes to prove that\r\nthe authors of corruption in electioneering matters were more guilty\r\nthan those they corrupted. At the Covent Garden hustings--where, on\r\nprevious occasions, the ministers had spent enormous sums, besides\r\nmoving every power and art of intrigue to get their own nominees\r\nreturned--the entire proceedings were one long scene of bribery,\r\ntrickery, and illegality, brute-force, and disorder. On the occasion in\r\nquestion, 1770, the administration seems to have been slightly cowed\r\nby the results of their ill-advised manœuvres to impose placemen upon\r\nthe county: the recent Middlesex proceedings were still a source of\r\nconcern; the constitution had been violated--not with impunity,--and\r\nserious effects in the way of impeachment were by no means impossible:\r\nconsequently, the people being left to the legitimate exercise of\r\ntheir liberties, the election passed off in the pacific, well-ordered,\r\nand regular manner described, freedom did not degenerate into licence,\r\n“no one was a penny the worse,” and the representative system in its\r\npurity of action was for once maintained in Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE ELECTIONS AND CONTROVERTED ELECTION PETITIONS, 1768 TO 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feats of the Whartons, Walpoles, Marlboroughs, Pelhams, and\r\nGraftons, in the direction of lavishing large sums for the corruption\r\nof the electorate, were dwarfed into insignificance by the fortunes\r\nstaked upon a single contest later on: thus the disbursements over a\r\ncontested election at Lincoln would be twelve thousand per candidate;\r\nand, we are told, “occasionally, after a hard fight at such places as\r\nColchester, all the defeated men appeared in the _Gazette_.” It is\r\nstated that the two great county contests for Hampshire, in 1790 and\r\n1806, cost the ministerial candidates twenty-five thousand apiece on\r\neach occasion, while their opponent’s expenses were proportionately\r\nlarge. The contest, still remembered by Northampton worthies as the\r\n“Spendthrift Election,” in which three earls fought for the borough\r\nelection in favour of their respective nominees in 1768, is a startling\r\ninstance of the lengths to which electioneering Peers were tempted\r\nto proceed in “scot and lot times.” The opponents were the Earls\r\nof Halifax, Northampton, and Spencer, and the respective nominees\r\nthey pitted against each other in this all but ruinous “tourney”\r\nwere Sir George Osborne, Sir George Bridges Rodney, and the Hon.\r\nThomas Howe. The candidates were of small account in the conflict;\r\ntheir patrons bore the brunt of the battle. The canvassing commenced\r\nlong before the polling; this was extended over fourteen days--a\r\nphenomenal circumstance in the days when elections were often settled\r\nand returns made before ten o’clock on the morning of the polling\r\nday. According to the poll-book, the legitimate number of electors,\r\nsome 930, was exceeded by 288, but confusion of persons is accounted\r\nfor by the promiscuous hospitalities of three noble mansions being\r\nat the mercies of the crowd for weeks: at the famous historical\r\nseats of Horton, Castle Ashby, and Althorp, the orgies pictured in\r\nHogarth’s “Election Dinner”--“filled with the tipsified humours” of\r\nwhat Bubb Dodington fitly called, “venal wretches”--were indefinitely\r\nprolonged. “The Scot and Lot,”--woolcombers, weavers, shoemakers,\r\nlabourers, pedlars, militia-men, and victuallers held “high revel,”\r\nprolonged without intercession from night till morning, and _vice\r\nversâ_, in the ancestral halls, of which, including the well-stocked\r\nwine-cellars, they were in a body “made free.” Therein lodged the\r\nperdition of Horton; for, after they had drained dry the goodly stock\r\nof matured port, Lord Halifax had to place before them his choicest\r\nclaret, whereon, with one accord, filled with vinous fastidiousness,\r\nthe “rabble rout” deserted to a man, declaring, “they would never\r\nvote for a man who gave them sour port,” and went over in a body to\r\nCastle Ashby. Each of the candidates claimed more votes than could be\r\nlegally registered in his favour. Howe, the unsuccessful candidate,\r\nwhose “potwallers” and “occasional voters” were likewise challenged,\r\npetitioned; and the “controverted election” came before the House of\r\nCommons. During the six weeks the scrutiny lasted, sixty covers were\r\ndaily spread at Spencer House, St. James’s, for those concerned in\r\nthe case. The results were no less eccentric: the number of votes\r\nbeing finally found equal, the election was referred to chance, and\r\ndecided by a toss, which Lord Spencer won, and nominated a man out in\r\nIndia. The cost of this escapade then had to be counted. It is said\r\nLord Spencer expended one hundred thousand pounds; his antagonists\r\nare credited with having wasted one hundred and fifty thousand pounds\r\neach--an incredible sum, considering this represents at least double\r\nthe equivalent amounts at the present day. Earl Spencer came off\r\nlightest, and appears to have been in no way involved; Lord Halifax\r\nwas ruined; Lord Northampton cut down his trees, sold his furniture\r\nat Compton Winyates, went abroad for the rest of his days, and died\r\nin Switzerland. Canon James, who has related the story of the famous\r\n“Spendthrift Election” in his “History of Northamptonshire,” mentions\r\nthat at Castle Ashby is still preserved a sealed box, labelled\r\n“Election Papers,” the evidence of this insane contest--one of no\r\npolitical moment; but none of the present generation has had the\r\ncourage to open the dread receptacle of bygone folly.\r\n\r\nA whimsical anecdote is related by Edgeworth, in his “Memoirs,”\r\nrespecting the contest for Andover at the general election in 1768,\r\nwhen Sir J. B. Griffin was returned at the head of the poll with\r\nseventeen votes; the second member was B. Lethieulier, with fifteen\r\nvotes; and the defeated candidate was Sir F. B. Delaval, who only\r\npolled seven. The latter was a celebrity, both in fashion and in\r\nthe politics of his day, and the story which is connected with his\r\nelectioneering experience properly belongs to the traditions of the\r\nsubject. Sir Francis found himself at loggerheads with his attorney, an\r\nacute practitioner, whose bill had been running for years, and, though\r\nconsiderable sums of money had been paid “on account,” a prodigious\r\nbalance was still claimed as unsettled; this Sir Francis disputed at\r\nlaw. When the case came before the Court of King’s Bench, amongst\r\nan exorbitant list of charges the following item excited general\r\nattention:--\r\n\r\n    “To being thrown out of the George Inn, Andover; to my legs\r\n        being thereby broken; to surgeon’s bill, and loss of time\r\n        and business; all in the service of Sir F. B. Delaval      £500.”\r\n\r\nIt was found that this charge required explanation. It appeared that\r\nthe attorney, by way of promoting the interests of his principal in\r\nthe borough, had sought to propitiate the favour of those important\r\npotentates at electioneering times, the mayor and corporation, in\r\nwhose hands, as seen in the foregoing, was vested so much of the\r\nlocal influence. A pretext was necessary to decoy these worthies to a\r\nbanquet, where they might be conciliated, so the attorney sent cards\r\nof invitation to the mayor and corporation in the name of the colonel\r\nand officers of a regiment in the town; he at the same time invited the\r\ncolonel and staff, in the name of the mayor and corporation, to dine\r\nand drink the king’s health on his birthday;--an ingenious _ruse_, but\r\nthe arch-diplomatist had literally “reckoned without his host.” The two\r\nparties met, were cordially courteous, ate a good dinner, toasted his\r\nmajesty’s health, and proceeded to other oratorical compliments before\r\nbreaking up. Then came the acknowledgments: the commanding officer of\r\nthe regiment made a handsome speech to Mr. Mayor, thanking him for his\r\nhospitable invitation and entertainment; “No, Colonel,” replied the\r\nmayor, “it is to you that thanks are due, by me and my brother-aldermen\r\nfor your generous treat to us.” The colonel replied with as much\r\nwarmth as good breeding would allow; the mayor retorted in downright\r\nanger, vowing that he would not be choused by the bravest colonel in\r\nHis Majesty’s service. “Mr. Mayor,” said the colonel, “there is no\r\nnecessity for displaying any vulgar passion on this occasion; permit me\r\nto show you that I have here your obliging card of invitation.” “Nay,\r\nMr. Colonel, here is no opportunity for bantering, there is your card.”\r\nThe cards were produced simultaneously. Upon examining the invitations,\r\nit was observed that, notwithstanding an attempt to disguise the hand,\r\nboth cards were written by some person who had designed to hoax them\r\nall. Every eye of the discomfited guests, corporation and officers\r\nalike, turned spontaneously upon the attorney, who had, of course,\r\nfound it necessary to be present to flatter the aldermen; his impudence\r\nsuddenly gave way, he faltered and betrayed himself so fully by his\r\nconfusion, that, in a fit of summary justice, the colonel threw him out\r\nof window; for this, Sir F. B. Delaval was charged £500.\r\n\r\nAmong the parodies of election addresses issued at the time of the\r\nrival Shelburne and Rockingham parties, is a broadside “embellished”\r\nwith a copperplate engraving of a whimsical assembly of citizens,\r\nmet in solemn conclave to examine the political views of a deformed\r\nsweeper-lad, “a public character,” who, it appears, was nicknamed by\r\nhis contemporaries “Sir Jeffery Dunstan.” The pointed satire is thus\r\nheaded:--\r\n\r\n    “‘What can we reason but from what we know?’--POPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“SIR JEFFERY DUNSTAN’S ADDRESS TO THE WORTHY ELECTORS OF THE ANCIENT\r\nBOROUGH OF GARRATT,\r\n\r\n\r\n“NOW FIRST PUBLISHED BY R. RUSTED,--AUTHOR OF ‘THE GUILDHALL ORATORS,’\r\nETC., ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘A tous ceux à qu’il appartiendra.’--VOLTAIRE.” (Otherwise\r\n“to all whom it concerns.”)\r\n\r\nThe candidate’s address is one of those confused harangues in which\r\na number of subjects are incongruously involved together, known in\r\nlater days as “a stump oration.” Among other subjects, Dr. Graham’s\r\n“celestial beds,” recruiting for the army, polygamy, and divorce,\r\n“the delicate brave men of the association” (volunteer force), and an\r\n“effete nobility,” are all mixed up according to the following sample:--\r\n\r\n    “As my honourable friend Mr. Burke cannot lessen the influence\r\n    of the Crown, myself and his grace of Richmond are determined\r\n    to accomplish it, by abolishing the use of money entirely; it\r\n    being irrevocable poison to men’s souls, and the only remedy\r\n    existing to prevent Bribery and Corruption; an evil which all\r\n    the learned gentry of Westminster Hall could never annihilate;\r\n    and I do faithfully declare, being no placeman, that I will not\r\n    waste my fleeting moments like the four city members, whose\r\n    elements of oratory what Roman senator could ever equal.”\r\n\r\nThe address rambles through a variety of absurdities, and concludes\r\nwith a quotation from Rusted’s “Poems.” Whoever that worthy may have\r\nbeen, his lines have a fine air of burlesque grandiloquence, sense\r\nbeing subordinated to sound:--\r\n\r\n    “Like those brave men, who nobly shed their blood,\r\n    I’ll die a Martyr for my Country’s good.\r\n    Be to my Sov’reign ever just and true,\r\n    And yield to Britain what is Britain’s due.\r\n    Maintain the cause, and thro’ the globe impart\r\n    The bright effusions of an honest heart.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is found in the collection of ballads and broadsides\r\nwhich it delighted Miss Banks to accumulate. It will be remembered\r\nthat eccentric lady was sister to Sir Joseph Banks, the president of\r\nthe Royal Society, and one most instrumental in founding the British\r\nMuseum, to which his collections and those of his sister were left.\r\nAmong Miss Banks’s “Political and Miscellaneous Broadsides” is another\r\nelectoral appeal to the same fanciful constituency; the document\r\notherwise seems almost a literal copy of an actual address of the day:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO THE NOBILITY, GENTRY, CLERGY, AND FREEMEN OF THE ANCIENT\r\nCORPORATIVE TOWN OF GARRATT.\r\n\r\n    “MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n    “Your Vote, Interest, and Poll (if needful) is earnestly\r\n    desired for Thomas, Lord SHINER, to be your\r\n    representative in Parliament, being a person zealously attached\r\n    to the King and Queen, and their numerous offspring of Princes\r\n    and princesses, and an enemy to all arbitrary Laws.\r\n\r\n    “His Lordship’s Committee for conducting the Election is held\r\n    at the ‘Three Jolly Butchers,’ and ‘Black Moor’s Head,’ Brook’s\r\n    Market, at which places his Lordship begs the audience of his\r\n    Friends.\r\n\r\n    “N.B.--His Lordship’s colours are Blue and Orange.\r\n\r\n  “⁂ Carriages will be ready on the Day of Election.”\r\n\r\nThose corrupted electors of Shoreham who resolved themselves into\r\na purchasable community on their own account, were roughly handled\r\nby the parliamentary inquisitors, but the avowed and professional\r\ntraffickers in venal boroughs seemed to conduct their trade openly,\r\nand, with the great parliamentary lights, unadmonished and unexposed.\r\nThey were generally the agents of those who had secured the influence\r\nin the seats by various methods--some by inheritance, others by\r\npatronage, sometimes by purchase _en bloc_, but generally _en détail_.\r\nMen invested in boroughs and cultivated them for sale, secure of a\r\nprofitable mart when the proper season arrived; the burgage-houses\r\nwere bought and accumulated; “shambles on old foundations” carrying\r\nvoting qualifications were secured; burgage tenures were bought up;\r\nvoters were pensioned from year to year, the process varying according\r\nto the nature of the suffrage. As in the case of Sheridan’s expenses\r\nat Stafford, the independent electors were retained at a settled price\r\nper head. Sheridan’s cost him five guineas per burgess; Wilberforce\r\nfound four guineas the price at Hull for a plumper. Southey says it\r\nrose to £30 a vote at Ilchester, Somerset, where the burgesses had a\r\ndirect control over their borough; although the tariff ran high, the\r\nfour candidates who recklessly bribed the constituents in 1774 lost\r\ntheir pains and money, petitions and counter-petitions establishing\r\nthat the members returned and those who alleged they were unjustly\r\nrejected were alike so palpably culpable of corruption that the\r\nelection was declared void. In 1826, Ilchester is given in the “Manual”\r\nas under the patronage of Sir W. Manners. Irrespective of the local\r\nand lesser bargains made with the mayors and burgesses, there was the\r\n“big business” conducted on behalf of the actual individual landholders\r\nof the place--those magnates set down in the election lists of\r\nconstituencies as “patrons” of boroughs, the dispensers of seats.\r\n\r\nFor an instance of the facility which characterized the _modus\r\noperandi_, though “the prices ruled high” owing to extraneous demands,\r\nsee the “Letters” of that skilled courtier, Lord Chesterfield, deeply\r\nversed in political chicanery and combination. In a passage of a letter\r\ndated Bath, December 19, 1767, he writes to that hopeful youth who by\r\n“Chesterfield’s Letters” was to be polished into a fine gentleman, and\r\nfor whom a place in Parliament was a desirable opening--\r\n\r\n    “In one of our conversations here this time twelvemonth I\r\n    desired my Lord Chatham to secure you a seat in the new\r\n    parliament. He assured me he would, and, I am convinced, very\r\n    sincerely.... Since that I have heard no more of it, which\r\n    made me look out for some venal borough; and I spoke to a\r\n    borough-jobber, and offered five and twenty hundred pounds for\r\n    a secure seat in parliament; but he laughed at my offer, and\r\n    said that there was no such thing as a borough to be had now,\r\n    for the rich East and West Indians had secured them all, at\r\n    the rate of three thousand pounds at least, but many at four\r\n    thousand, _and two or three that he knew at five thousand_.\r\n    This, I confess, has vexed me a good deal.”\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about “Old Sarum” (Wilts) as being typical of the\r\nunabashed and confirmed borough-mongering and corruption which existed\r\nnot only in the last century, but, in fact, until the larger measure\r\nof Reform carried in 1832. Representative government, conducted on the\r\nprinciples which prevailed in “hole-and-corner boroughs” until the\r\npassing of that bill against which even Sir Robert Peel protested as a\r\ndangerous innovation, certainly, for the most part, had but a theoretic\r\nexistence, as a review of the facts sufficiently demonstrates. Amongst\r\nthe statistics given in Stockdale’s “Parliamentary Guide” (1784), Dr.\r\nWillis writes that the borough of Old Sarum was then reduced to _one\r\nhouse_. It returned members in 23 Edw. 1, and then intermitted until\r\n34 Edw. 3, since which time representatives were returned until its\r\ndisfranchisement. These were at first elected in the county-court,\r\nas was then customary; from 1688, the right of election was in “the\r\nfreeholders being burgage-holders” and the number was _seven_. In 1826,\r\nwhen the last parliament of George IV.’s reign assembled, this state\r\nof things was unaltered, the patron was the Earl of Caledon, and the\r\nmysterious seven remained. New Sarum, otherwise Salisbury, which had\r\ntaken the place of “Old Sarum,” received its privileges by letters\r\npatent, 2 Hen. 3, which conferred on the bishops and canons _tanquam\r\nproprium dominicum_; afterwards confirmed by charter 34 Edw. 1. In\r\n1784, there were about fifty-six voters; the right of election being\r\n“in the select number, that is, the mayor and corporation.” The Earl\r\nof Radnor and G. P. Jervoise were the patrons in 1826, when Viscount\r\nFolkestone and Wadham Wyndham were returned by the fifty-four electors\r\nthen set down as the suffrage-holders.\r\n\r\nBoroughbridge, Yorkshire, was another scandalous and typical\r\n“pocket-borough” which obtained notoriety, especially at the time\r\nof the passing of Lord Grey’s Reform Bill, Sir Charles Wetherell\r\nbeing turned into satiric capital by Doyle (HB), in his versions\r\nof the “Last of the Boroughbridges.” The right of election was in\r\nthe burgage-holders--a “pocket-borough” tenure, thus denounced by\r\nCharles James Fox: “If a man comes into parliament as the proprietor\r\nof a burgage tenure, he does not come there as the representative\r\nof the people,” as explained in the eloquent speech of the great\r\nWhig chief, on Grey’s motion for Reform, 1797. The Duke of Newcastle\r\nwas the patron, and sixty burgage-holders returned two members. The\r\nconstituency of Helston, where the franchise was originally invested in\r\na corporation, under the Old Charter, had in 1790 dwindled down to one\r\nelector, to whose lot it fell to nominate two representatives.\r\n\r\nThe case of a “controverted election” at Hindon, Wilts, where the\r\nright of election was of an easy order, viz. “inhabitants of houses\r\nwithin the borough, being housekeepers and parishioners, not securing\r\nalms,” raised an altogether pretty scandal in the way of revelations on\r\ncorrupt treating. The sitting members, returned in 1774, being Richard\r\nSmith and T. Brand Hollis, the unsuccessful candidates, James Calthorpe\r\nand Richard Beckford, were the petitioners on the ground that the\r\nformer, by the bribery of themselves and their agents, had procured an\r\nillegal return. On the hearing of the petition it was discovered that\r\nall or the major part of the voters for all four candidates had been\r\nbribed, and the committee pronounced the election void. The candidates\r\nthemselves had not only bribed, but thirteen electors, acting as\r\nagents, had also been employed to corrupt their fellow-voters. The\r\ncommittee resolved to disfranchise these electors:--\r\n\r\n    “A bill was then ordered to incapacitate from voting at\r\n    elections of members of parliament 190 persons, besides the\r\n    thirteen above-mentioned, out of 210 who had polled at the\r\n    election.”\r\n\r\nThese persons appealed against the bill, and there being technical\r\nobjections to the petitioners “being parties to and alike defendants\r\nin an indictment,” it was argued they “could not, without overturning\r\nthe known rules of law and justice, be received as witnesses in this\r\ncase.” By a tacit agreement the unfortunate cross-petitions were\r\ndropped the ensuing session, and two new writs were issued; meanwhile\r\nthe attorney-general, on separate informations, proceeded against the\r\nfour candidates (June, 1775) for bribery at elections, held to be a\r\ncrime at common law independent of any statute against it. All the four\r\ninformations were tried at the Lent assizes in the county of Wilts,\r\nMarch, 1775, before Baron Hotham. The two petitioners who were in the\r\nfirst instance responsible for this scrutiny were acquitted; Smith and\r\nHollis, who had been returned, were found guilty, and were brought\r\nup to the Court of King’s Bench to receive judgment: this was on the\r\n20th of May, the last day of the term, and the judges desiring time to\r\nconsider the proper punishment, they were committed till the next term\r\nto the King’s Bench prison. Meanwhile, previous to this commitment, the\r\nnew election for Hindon had taken place (May 16th), and Mr. Richard\r\nSmith was again returned. On the 7th of June, Smith and Hollis were\r\nagain brought up for judgment, when they were each fined 1000 marks[57]\r\nand sentenced to prison for six months, and until they paid their\r\nrespective fines; and it was ordered that Richard Smith should give\r\nsecurity for his good behaviour for three years, himself in the sum of\r\n£1000, and two sureties each of £500.\r\n\r\nA flagrant instance of boroughmongering was exposed during a\r\nparliamentary investigation into a case of controverted election at\r\nMilborne Port, Somerset, where the right of voting was, amongst others,\r\nin the capital bailiffs and their two deputies. The petition proposed\r\nto disqualify eleven votes upon the score of “occasionality,” and to\r\nobject to eleven who voted for the sitting members and were disabled\r\nby a corrupt bargain made between Mr. Medlycott, the senior member,\r\nand Loyd, an agent of Lord North’s. There were nine bailiwicks in the\r\nborough, with a bailiff appointed for each. Mr. Medlycott had long\r\nbeen in possession of four of these, and the remaining five belonged\r\nto the family of Walters. A remarkable example of downright trading\r\nappeared as the case developed. In February, 1770, Loyd arrived at\r\nMilborne Port as the friend of Lord North. A meeting was held at Yeovil\r\nbetween the agent and the patron, two or three others being present, at\r\nthe house of one Daniel; where a contract was duly drawn up, signed,\r\nand witnessed, by which Medlycott agreed to sell the borough, and to\r\nthrow out his old friend, the Hon. Temple Luttrell, who was one of\r\nthe persons presenting the petition, which revealed the underground\r\nworkings of administrative jobbery. The writing drawn up at Yeovil\r\npurported to be the “memorandum of an agreement to defray the expenses\r\nof procuring a seat in parliament for any friend of Lord North, whom\r\nhis lordship or Loyd should recommend.” To this end Loyd agreed to\r\ndeposit fifteen hundred pounds in Daniel’s hands, to be employed in\r\npurchasing the family interest of the Walters in the remaining five\r\nbailiwicks for the use and at the risk of Medlycott, who stipulated\r\nto pay Loyd five per cent. for the money so advanced, until such time\r\nas Lord North’s friend should be seated peaceably fourteen days in\r\nparliament--the time allowed for petitioning. The paper was put into\r\nLord North’s hands, who returned it to Daniel, without committing\r\nhimself to any observation. On the faith of this instrument--\r\n\r\n    “The Walters’ property in the voters was transferred; the five\r\n    bailiffs were nominated, and consigned to Medlycott’s interest,\r\n    thus purchased by Loyd. But the patron of the borough, on\r\n    assuming the undivided influence therein, in the spirit of\r\n    friendship wrote to his colleague Luttrell on the subject,\r\n    acknowledged this foul transaction, and urged the wretched\r\n    excuse _that his poverty, and not his will, consented_.”\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the petitioners further said they would give evidence\r\nof the bribery, and several offers made, also of the _treats_ given\r\nto influence the voters. The ministerial influence seems to have been\r\nparamount on this occasion; as the committee determined, in the face\r\nof the absolute documentary evidence, and other proofs of bribery,\r\ntreating, illegal voting, and refusal to register legitimate votes\r\non behalf of the petitioners, that the gentleman who had sold the\r\nseat in the borough to Lord North was--with the second ministerial\r\nnominee, brought in by his venality--duly elected. This borough of\r\nMilborne Port seems to have been a snug haven for nominees: in 1826\r\nthe patronage was at the joint disposal of the Marquis of Anglesea\r\nand Sir W. Coles Medlycott, and returned the Hon. Berkeley Paget and\r\nLord Graves--proving the utility of “a stake in the country.” The\r\nwarming-pan constituency was swept away, with similar anomalies, by the\r\nReform Bill carried by Lord Grey.\r\n\r\nIn the general election of 1774 the contest for Westminster was marked\r\nby the unblushing exertion of much undue influence. Not only did two\r\nducal houses bring all the weight of their purses and ministerial\r\ninfluence, adding to almost limitless resources such strong inducements\r\nas the Duke of Northumberland, with his metropolitan patronage, and\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, with his placemen, pensions, and ministerial\r\npatronage, could bring to bear for the return of younger scions of\r\nthe two houses concerned; the royal authority was freely used, and\r\nthe king’s servants, without, it was shown, any qualifications as\r\nvoters, were allowed to record their voices for the return of the\r\nCourt candidates. The famous election of 1784, although stronger in\r\nincident, must have been tame by comparison. Not only members of the\r\nroyal household, but divers peers of the realm and lords of parliament\r\npublicly canvassed, and otherwise unduly interfered in the election,\r\ncontrary to several express resolutions of the House. The candidates\r\nstood thus at the close of the poll:--Earl Percy, 4995; Lord Thomas\r\nPelham Clinton, 4744; Lord Mountmorres, 2531; Charles Stanhope, Lord\r\nMahon, 2342; and Humphrey Cotes, 130. A petition was presented by Lord\r\nMountmorres and several electors of the city and liberty of Westminster\r\nagainst the return of Earl Percy and Lord T. P. Clinton, seeing that--\r\n\r\n    “the king’s menial servants, not having proper houses of their\r\n    own within the city of Westminster, gave voices in the said\r\n    election, contrary to an express resolution of the House; that\r\n    peers and lords unduly interfered and tampered with the voters;\r\n    that during the election, after the _teste_ and issuing out\r\n    of the writ, Lord Percy and Lord Thomas Pelham Clinton, by\r\n    themselves or agents, were guilty of bribing, corrupting, and\r\n    entertaining the voters, (who must have made a fairly good\r\n    thing of the contest); and that they allowed to the electors,\r\n    and several persons who had or claimed a right to vote, money,\r\n    meat, drink, entertainment, or provision; and that by those,\r\n    and other undue means, a majority of votes was procured for\r\n    Lord Percy and Lord T. P. Clinton, so that they were returned,\r\n    and the petitioners prayed such relief as upon examination\r\n    should appear just.”\r\n\r\nAs bribery commissions were then constituted, the party in power\r\ngenerally managed to make disputed returns a means of strengthening\r\ntheir own majority, so that although the House took the pains to\r\nexamine the several allegations, it was decided that the sitting\r\nmembers were duly elected.\r\n\r\nOn the respective counts it was found that there was no general\r\ndetermination as to the right of election in Westminster, but it\r\nseemed agreed that the suffrages were vested “in the inhabitants,\r\nhouseholders, paying scot and lot;” that the king’s menial servants,\r\nnot having proper houses of their own within the city of Westminster,\r\nwere not entitled to vote--as they had done, on the pretence of\r\nbeing residents in the royal palaces of St. James and elsewhere. It\r\nwas admitted that the following resolution, providing against the\r\ninterposition of peers in elections for the Commons, had been renewed\r\non the opening of the House, from session to session, since the Act was\r\nmade, January 3, 1701:--\r\n\r\n    “Resolved that it is a high infringement of the liberties and\r\n    privileges of the Commons of Great Britain for any lord of\r\n    parliament or any lord-lieutenant of any county to concern\r\n    themselves in the elections of members to serve for the Commons\r\n    in parliament.”\r\n\r\nThe petitioners set forth that it would appear, by different\r\nallegations, that the rights of the election had been invaded in\r\na manner highly alarming, so as to call for the interposition and\r\ncensure of the House; but the report of the committee disposed of these\r\nobjections by finding the petitioners were not able to prove any direct\r\nsolicitation of the peers.\r\n\r\nA similar objection was raised on the same general election as to the\r\nlegal return of the sitting members for Worcester,--that a peer and\r\nlord of parliament had, by himself and his agents, interfered in the\r\nelection by publicly canvassing and soliciting votes, and by using\r\nthreats to intimidate freemen from voting for the petitioner, in\r\nviolation of the privileges of the House and the freedom of election,\r\nand to the infringement of the rights of the Commons of Great Britain.\r\nMoreover, there was an allegation of bribery, and that conducted on a\r\nwholesale scale. The mayor, aldermen, and justices of the city, the\r\ntown-clerk and many of the common council had sworn in, for several\r\ndays before and during the election, many freemen (some hundreds) to\r\nbe constables, under a promise that they would vote for the candidates\r\nchosen by the persons so influencing them, “for which they were to have\r\ncertain rewards in money;” and that this money was afterwards paid to\r\nthem out of the funds of the city, or by the two sitting members.\r\n\r\nIn transparent cases of bribery, when the committee of the “whole\r\nHouse” serving on these “controverted elections” decided to retain and\r\nconfirm the sitting members, there seems to have been a convenient\r\nformula much resorted to in silencing those petitions brought on the\r\ngrounds of corruption; for instance, after the general elections of\r\n1774,--\r\n\r\n    “An objection was taken to the petitioners examining any\r\n    witness as to the payment, till they should first bring proof\r\n    of the agency. It was argued that the circumstances which would\r\n    establish both points were so complicated that they could not\r\n    be separated;”\r\n\r\n_ergo_, all evidence on the points to be proved was technically\r\nexcluded, and the petition was stultified.\r\n\r\nIt seems, also, to have been not unusual for high sheriffs to return\r\nthemselves; for instance, in the controverted election case for\r\nAbingdon, Berks, March, 1774-5. The petitioner set forth that the\r\nmember returned was then high sheriff for the county of Berks; his\r\ncounsel arguing, “that by an express clause in the writ of election\r\nthe choice of sheriffs is prohibited; and that this clause has made\r\npart of the writ for three centuries.” It was admitted that Sir Edward\r\nCoke, sheriff of Buckinghamshire, had been returned for Norfolk in the\r\nsecond year of Charles I., and that he sat till the dissolution of\r\nthat parliament; but his right was questioned, and in the “Journals\r\nand Debates” he is invariably described as a member _de facto_. It was\r\ncontended in reply, on the other side, that the sheriff was justified\r\nin his return, the wording of the writ not being taken literally, in\r\nany case such as “knights girt with a sword;” that Mr. Child, being\r\nsheriff of Warwickshire, was chosen and returned for Wells, in the\r\ncounty of Somerset; he was petitioned against, but was declared duly\r\nelected. It was also stated, on behalf of the controverted sitting\r\nmember, that--\r\n\r\n    “since the statute of the 23rd Henry VI., the sheriff is in no\r\n    respect the returning officer for boroughs; he is obliged to\r\n    accept the return sent him, with his precept, and is merely the\r\n    conduit-pipe to convey it to the clerk of the crown.”\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the member whose return was impeached further observed\r\nthat if sheriffs could not be chosen members of parliament, the Crown\r\nwould be able to prevent any one from being elected, by taking care\r\nto make him a sheriff before the election; by which means, in bad\r\ntimes, every friend to the rights of the people might be excluded\r\nfrom sitting in the House of Commons. On this occasion, as the high\r\nsheriff had returned himself, that is to say, for his own county, it\r\nwas thought proper to decide that the election was void; thus, at the\r\nsame time, disqualifying the petitioner as well, which, was seemingly\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nThere were two petitions presented in reference to the controverted\r\nelection at Morpeth, Northumberland, in 1774. On this occasion\r\nit was violence and intimidation more than corrupt and illegal\r\npractices--though all had been resorted to--which had unjustly\r\ninfluenced the return. The candidates were the Hon. William Byron,\r\nFrancis Eyre, T. C. Bigge, and Peter Delme.\r\n\r\n    “It was proved by a number of witnesses, that, at the end of\r\n    the Poll, the majority was declared to be in favour of Delme\r\n    and Byron (a counter-petition set forth that a majority had\r\n    been obtained for Delme by the corrupt practices of Byron), but\r\n    that the returning officers were _compelled_ to return Delme\r\n    and Eyre: and it was also proved that, on the morning of the\r\n    election, before it began, Eyre made an inflammatory speech to\r\n    the people; that after the riot began, he having retired some\r\n    time before, the returning officers sent him word they would\r\n    return whom he pleased, and that an answer being brought them,\r\n    that they must return himself and Mr. Delme, they complied, and\r\n    the riot ceased.”\r\n\r\nThe decision of the committee was that the gentleman who, as master of\r\nthe mob, had directed the storm, was _not_ duly elected, while the Hon.\r\nW. Byron, who had found his way to the suffrages of the voters through\r\ntheir pockets, must be returned, together with his nominee, Delme,\r\nalready seated.\r\n\r\nAt Petersfield, Hants, in 1774, the Hon. John Luttrell was unfortunate,\r\nand brought a petition against the two members returned, Sir Abraham\r\nHume and William Jolliffe, the former being high sheriff for the county\r\nof Hertford, and both--\r\n\r\n    “having been guilty of divers acts of bribery, by money, meat,\r\n    drink, reward, entertainment, and provision; and that James\r\n    Showell, pretending to be mayor, had acted partially.”\r\n\r\nThree or four witnesses were called to prove that gifts and promises\r\nhad been made by Mr. Jolliffe in the presence of the other sitting\r\nmember; in the course of this evidence--\r\n\r\n    “one Newnam was called to prove a declaration made to him by\r\n    Brackstone a voter, about having got the promise of a _house_\r\n    from Mr. Jolliffe for his vote.”\r\n\r\nThe committee resolved that the evidence was inadmissible on the\r\ngrounds that--\r\n\r\n    “although the declaration (not upon oath) of a person who\r\n    cannot be obliged to be a witness on the subject himself, is\r\n    admissible in evidence to _affect such person_, yet is not\r\n    admissible _against a third party_.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the traditional figure of “Punch” is associated with\r\npunishments dealt out indiscriminately, it appears in the old\r\nelectioneering days he was the agent for distributing illicit rewards\r\nfor iniquitous acts. In the case of a “controverted election” for the\r\nborough of Shaftesbury (Dorset) the evidence produced vividly recalls\r\nHogarth’s representation of an election broadside, “Punch, Candidate\r\nfor Guzzletown,” introduced in his picture of “Canvassing for Votes.”\r\nAfter the general election, 1774, it was alleged that the sitting\r\nmembers, Sykes and Rumbold, by themselves or their agents, had been\r\nguilty of bribery, while it was attempted to be shown that Mortimer,\r\nwho was the petitioner, had promised money to procure his election.\r\nThe trial lasted four weeks, and among the points of evidence was\r\nthe following indictment against the manœuvres of “Punch:”--Money,\r\nto the amount of several thousand pounds, had been given among\r\nthe electors,[58] in sums of twenty guineas a man (654 votes were\r\nrecorded in 1774; 532 being for Sykes and Rumbold). The persons who\r\nwere entrusted with the distribution of this money, and who were\r\nchiefly the magistrates of the town, fell upon a very singular and\r\nabsurd contrivance, in hopes of being able thereby to hide through\r\nwhat channel it was conveyed to the electors. A person concealed\r\nunder a ludicrous and fantastical disguise, and called by the name\r\nof “Punch,” was placed in a small apartment, and, through a hole in\r\nthe door, delivered out to the voters parcels containing the twenty\r\nguineas; upon which they were conducted to another apartment in the\r\nsame house, where they found a person called “Punch’s secretary,” and\r\nsigned notes for the value, but which were made payable to an imaginary\r\ncharacter, to whom they had given the name of “Glenbucket.” Two of\r\nthe witnesses, called by the counsel for the petitioner, swore that\r\nthey had seen “Punch” through the hole in the door, and that they\r\nknew him to be one Matthews, an alderman of Shaftesbury; and, as the\r\ncounsel for the petitioner had endeavoured to prove, an agent for the\r\nsitting members. It was said that those voters who admitted that they\r\nhad received “Punch’s” money, had at the poll taken the bribery oath;\r\nit was contended for the other side that this was not legal evidence,\r\nthat “it would be unjust to suffer what a man had said in conversation,\r\nand without an oath, to invalidate what he had solemnly sworn.” The\r\ncommittee determined that, with regard to supposed agents, evidence\r\nshould be first produced to establish the agency, before the bribery\r\nby such persons should be gone into. In the sequel it was determined\r\nthat the two sitting members were not duly elected, and that the\r\npetitioner should be returned. “Punch,” his exertions, and his profuse\r\ndistribution of bribes proved a grievous failure.\r\n\r\nNot only was bribery freely practised under one or another disguise,\r\nbut even the result of the petitions and scrutinies were made the\r\nsubject of corruption. In a controverted election for Sudbury, in 1780,\r\nfor instance, the question was put to the committee, “Whether a person\r\nwho had laid a wager of about £40 on the event of the petition was\r\ncompetent to give evidence in the cause?” the decision being in the\r\naffirmative. This Sudbury election was altogether an odd affair.\r\n\r\n    “The mayor was the returning officer, and the petitioner\r\n    alleged that at the close of the poll it was declared in his\r\n    favour, but that afterwards a scrutiny was illegally demanded,\r\n    when the other candidates were pronounced duly elected.” It was\r\n    given in the evidence “that the election began Sep. 8, 1780,\r\n    about ten o’clock in the morning, and continued until it was\r\n    dark: that the petitioner and his friends then desired the\r\n    mayor to adjourn the poll to the following day; but that he\r\n    refused, and proceeded all night by candlelight”--\r\n\r\nthe election ending between six and seven o’clock the following\r\nmorning: “There was some tumult during a part of the poll, but that it\r\nwas upon the whole a very peaceable election.” This goes far to prove\r\nthat an election must have been an extraordinarily turbulent business a\r\ncentury back, when proceedings varied by “a tumult during part of the\r\npoll” was admitted to be peaceful in an unusual degree.\r\n\r\nThe Shaftesbury arrangements for presenting voters with packets of\r\ntwenty guineas were outdone by the electors of Shoreham, who combined\r\nand resolved themselves into a joint-stock company, that they\r\nthemselves might derive the advantage from their borough which in\r\nother cases was monopolized by the patrons, or holders of bailiwicks.\r\nThe suffrages being originally in the mayor and burgesses, these\r\nelectors, with a forethought superior to their generation, organized\r\nthemselves into a compact league, or caucus, for electioneering\r\npurposes; but _not_ with the intention of resisting and keeping out\r\ncorrupt practices: the nature of this compact was disclosed during\r\nthe hearing of the petition of Thomas Rumbold, on the election of a\r\nmember in place of Sir Samuel Cornish deceased, and is set down in\r\nthe _Journals_ of the House (vol. 33), 1770-1. It appeared that the\r\npetitioner was duly elected, those who voted for him, to the number\r\nof eighty-seven, taking the bribery oath; as to the other candidates,\r\nthirty-seven votes were given for Purling and four for James; but the\r\nreturning officer placed queries against the names of seventy-six of\r\nthe petitioner Rumbold’s voters, and immediately on the close of the\r\npoll declared Purling duly elected. The fourth plea related that in\r\nthis borough of Shoreham had subsisted for many years a body which had\r\nassumed the name of the “Christian Society,” though its organization\r\nwas quite outside the diffusion of benevolence or Christianity; none\r\nbut electors for representatives in parliament were admitted into the\r\nsociety, but the great majority of those who had votes were enrolled. A\r\nclerk was employed, and a meeting-place provided, where regular monthly\r\nand frequent occasional meetings were held, upon which gatherings a\r\nflag was hoisted to give notice to the members. About 1767, the members\r\nof the society entered into articles for raising and distributing small\r\nsums of money for charitable uses, these articles being designed to\r\ncover the real intention of the institution. The principal purpose of\r\ntheir meetings was for what they denominated _burgessing business_.\r\nAn oath of secrecy was administered to all the members, who farther\r\nentered into a bond, under a penalty of five hundred pounds, to bring\r\nthem all together with regard to _burgessing_; but otherwise the\r\nconditions of the bond were not allowed to appear. Upon any vacancy\r\nin the representation of the borough, the society always appointed\r\na committee to _treat with the candidates for the purchase of the\r\nseat_, and the committees were constantly instructed _to get the most\r\nmoney and make the best bargain they could_; the society had no other\r\npurpose in view, and had no standing committee. On a false report of\r\nthe death of the sitting member, Sir Samuel Cornish, the society was\r\ncalled together by the signal of the flag. On that meeting, which was\r\nnumerously attended, the members declared that _they would support the\r\nhighest bidder_; but some of their number, including Hugh Roberts,\r\nthe returning officer impeached in the petition, expressed themselves\r\noffended at such a declaration, and declared that they were afraid\r\nof the consequences, for the society was nothing but _a heap of\r\nbribery_, and withdrew from the body; but two months later, one of\r\nthese ex-members returning to a meeting of the society, was treated\r\nwith harsh expressions, and was told he came among them as a spy.\r\nThe society, however, continued to meet, their gatherings being more\r\nfrequent near election time. It was said that, on the death of Sir\r\nSamuel Cornish, when a vacancy occurred, a committee was appointed to\r\ntreat for the seat with the incoming candidate, the members of the said\r\ncommittee themselves being careful to abstain from voting, though they\r\nwere there on the day of election; three days before the polling, the\r\nsociety was reported to be dissolved, in order to escape the odium of\r\nproceedings on petition, but that the meetings had been resumed since.\r\nIn the face of this evidence, Mr. Purling’s counsel acquainted the\r\ncourt “that he could not carry his case further than by the witnesses\r\nexamined, and could not impeach Mr. Rumbold’s election or affect his\r\nvotes.” Although this closed the petitioning case, it was resolved\r\nthat a further inquiry ought to be made into the transactions of the\r\nsociety, and a bill was ordered “to incapacitate certain persons from\r\nvoting at elections,” together with an address to the king to order\r\nthe attorney-general to “prosecute certain persons for an illegal and\r\ncorrupt conspiracy in relation to the late election for Shoreham.”\r\nThe bill was carried, printed, copies served on the offenders, passed\r\nthrough the House, agreed to by the Lords, and received the royal\r\nassent. The returning officer was ordered into the custody of the\r\nserjeant-at-arms; he was finally brought to the bar of the House to be\r\nreprimanded and discharged.\r\n\r\nNew Shoreham appears later under the patronage of the Duke of Norfolk\r\nand Earl of Egremont; the suffrage in 1771, after the extraordinary\r\nfederation described in the foregoing, was extended to forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders, “in the rape of Bramber,” in which Shoreham is situated.\r\n\r\nR. B. Sheridan, the brilliant but unstable genius,[59] sat for Stafford\r\nfrom 1780, until that ill-considered attempt to represent the city\r\nof Westminster in the place of his deceased friend, the great Charles\r\nJames Fox, which completed his financial ruin. “Sherry” was notorious\r\nfor looseness in his accounts, and it is curious to find one of the\r\nfew circumstantial statements of election outlays calculated upon\r\nthis unbusinesslike representative’s borough expenses for the first\r\nparliament in which he represented Stafford--always a moderate place,\r\nas prices ruled,--Sheridan being brought in chiefly by the influence of\r\nthe shoemakers, an extensive body there.\r\n\r\n\r\nR.

B. Sheridan was, by a coalition with Sir Samuel Hood,\r\nelected for Westminster--a seat lost by him, to his ruin, on the\r\nunexpected dissolution the year following,--his son, Tom Sheridan, that\r\n“proverbial pickle,” whose love of mischief and readiness of resource\r\nwere alike remarkable, was offered for election in his gifted father’s\r\nplace; the reputation of the Sheridans was, however, on the wane, and\r\nTom, though admirable and even unapproachable at the hustings, was\r\nhardly endowed with the sterling qualities which should be found in a\r\nrepresentative of the people to the Commons. The electors made choice\r\nof two Tory candidates, R. M. Phillips (412), and the Hon. E. Monckton\r\n(408), leaving but a poor record of votes for Thomas Sheridan (165). An\r\namusing instance is recorded of the good-will of the constituents on\r\nthis occasion:--\r\n\r\n    “When Mr. Clifford introduced Mr. R. M. Phillips to the\r\n    electors--the journeymen shoemakers, as a token of respect,\r\n    insisted that they should present him with a new hat, which was\r\n    accordingly done, on the hustings, by a contribution of one\r\n    penny each.”\r\n\r\nTruly an exceptional circumstance, when voters--although expectant to\r\nreceive--were rarely prepared to bestow, even their “voices,” unless\r\nfor an adequate consideration!\r\n\r\nThe first entry into public life of William Pitt, as related by Earl\r\nStanhope, is characteristic of the easy mode of procedure in those\r\ndays, when a great man had merely to name his friends, and his tenants\r\nelected them. “Hitherto,” wrote Sir George Savile in 1780, “I have\r\nbeen elected in Lord Rockingham’s dining-room. Now I am returned by\r\nmy constituents.” The spirit of the country, it was asserted, was\r\nrising at that period, but in 1780, it was still manifest that the\r\nterritorial magnates and the monopolists of the borough franchises had\r\ntheir “own sweet will.” Pitt’s early friend, the eldest son of that\r\nGranby who had been an attached follower of Lord Chatham, had, mindful\r\nof this hereditary friendship, sought the acquaintance of William\r\nPitt at the beginning of the latter’s career at Cambridge. Granby was\r\nfive years Pitt’s senior; he became one of the members for Cambridge\r\nUniversity, and in 1779 had the fortune to succeed his grandfather as\r\nDuke of Rutland. On Pitt’s coming to London, to commence his career,\r\nthe young men became intimate, and the warm attachment between them,\r\nwhich continued during the whole of the duke’s life, was the cause of\r\nthe early advancement of the son of the great Commoner. Owing to the\r\nDuke of Rutland’s solicitude to see Pitt in parliament, he spoke upon\r\nthe subject to Sir James Lowther, another ally of his house, and the\r\nowner of most extensive borough influence. Sir James quickly caught\r\nthe idea, and proposed to avail himself of a double return for one of\r\nhis boroughs to bring the friend of his friend into parliament. The\r\nduke mentioned the offer to Pitt; and Pitt, who was writing on the same\r\nday to his mother, Lady Chatham, added a few lines in haste to let her\r\nknow. But it was not until he had seen Sir James himself that he was\r\nable to express his entire satisfaction at the prospect now before him.\r\n\r\n  “Lincoln’s Inn, Thursday Night, Nov., 1780.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MOTHER,\r\n\r\n    “I can now inform you that I have seen Sir James Lowther, who\r\n    has repeated to me the offer he had before made, and in the\r\n    handsomest manner. Judging from my father’s principles, he\r\n    concludes that mine would be agreeable to his own, and on that\r\n    ground--to me of all others the most agreeable--to bring me\r\n    in. No kind of condition was mentioned, but that if ever our\r\n    lines of conduct should become opposite, I should give him\r\n    an opportunity of choosing another person. On such liberal\r\n    terms I could certainly not hesitate to accept the proposal,\r\n    than which nothing could be in any respect more agreeable.\r\n    Appleby is the place I am to represent, and the election will\r\n    be made (probably in a week or ten days) without my having any\r\n    trouble, or even visiting my constituents. I shall be in time\r\n    to be spectator and auditor _at least_ of the important scene\r\n    after the holidays. I would not defer confirming to you this\r\n    intelligence, which I believe you will not be sorry to hear.”\r\n\r\nIt is added (Dec. 7, 1780),--\r\n\r\n    “I have not yet received the notification of my election. It\r\n    will probably not take place till the end of this week, as Sir\r\n    James Lowther was to settle an election at Haslemere before\r\n    he went into the north, and meant to be present at Appleby\r\n    afterwards. The parliament adjourned yesterday, so I shall not\r\n    take my seat till after the holidays.”\r\n\r\nThis confidence discloses that such a thing as a contest, let alone a\r\ndefeat, was not for a moment entertained.\r\n\r\n    “I propose before long, in spite of politics, to make an\r\n    excursion for a short time to Lord Westmoreland’s (Althorp,\r\n    Northamptonshire), and shall probably look at my constituents\r\n    that should have been, at Cambridge, in my way.”\r\n\r\nAbout three years later, William Pitt, by that time the most\r\nconspicuous statesman of his day, and already prime minister of\r\nEngland by the royal will, on the downfall of the coalition, realized\r\nhis former ambition, and he offered himself successfully for the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge. In order to enter for this distinction, Pitt\r\nhad declined two seats, voluntarily placed at his disposal: when the\r\nwar-cry arose from the hustings throughout the kingdom, he was put in\r\nnomination, without either his knowledge or consent, for the city of\r\nLondon, as usual the first election in point of time; the show of hands\r\nwas declared to be in the young statesman’s favour, but when apprised\r\nof the fact he declined the poll. Such were the honours heaped upon\r\nthis proud juvenile premier, that he was constantly refusing favours\r\nsolicitously placed at his acceptance.\r\n\r\n    “He was pressed,” says Earl Stanhope, “to stand for several\r\n    other cities and towns, more especially for the city of Bath,\r\n    which his father had represented, and the king was vexed at his\r\n    refusal of this offer. But the choice of Pitt was already made.\r\n    He had determined, as we have seen, to offer himself for the\r\n    University of Cambridge.”\r\n\r\nHe held at this time all the state patronage, and, moreover, with the\r\nking at his back, he meant mischief to the members of the ministry\r\nrecently displaced from power by his royal master; and was about to\r\ntrust to his faculties and the reserve forces he could command for a\r\ngreat electioneering campaign. He found time to write to his friend in\r\nYorkshire:--\r\n\r\n    “DEAR WILBERFORCE,\r\n\r\n    “Parliament will be prorogued to-day and dissolved to-morrow.\r\n    The latter operation has been in some danger of delay by a\r\n    curious manœuvre, that of stealing the Great Seal last night\r\n    from the Chancellor’s, but we shall have a new one ready in\r\n    time. I send you a copy of the Speech which will be made in two\r\n    hours from the Throne. You may speak of it in the past tense,\r\n    instead of in the _future_.... I am told Sir Robert Hildyard\r\n    is the right candidate for the county. You must take care\r\n    to keep all our friends together, and to _tear the enemy to\r\n    pieces_. I set out this evening for Cambridge, where I expect,\r\n    notwithstanding your boding, to find everything favourable. I\r\n    am sure, however, to find a retreat at Bath.\r\n\r\n  “Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n  “W. PITT.”\r\n\r\nThough Pitt had the “good things” to give away he did not escape\r\nsarcasm: thus it was suggested--it is said by Paley, who was then at\r\nCambridge--as a fitting text for a university sermon, “There is a lad\r\nhere which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes; but what are\r\nthey among so many?”\r\n\r\n    “The author of this pleasantry,” declares Stanhope, “did not\r\n    allow for the public temper of the time; in most cases the\r\n    electors voted without views of personal interest; in some\r\n    cases they voted even against views of personal interest.”\r\n\r\nPitt was supported by Lord Euston, the heir of the Duke of Grafton, and\r\nbetween them they defeated the late members, the Hon. John Townshend,\r\nand James Mansfield, both members of the coalition ministry, the\r\nformer as lord of the admiralty, the latter as solicitor-general.\r\nAfter a keen contest, Pitt and Lord Euston were returned, Pitt at the\r\nhead of the poll. It was a marked triumph, and exercised an influence\r\nelsewhere; nor was it a fleeting victory or a temporary connection,\r\nfor Pitt continued to represent the university during the remainder of\r\nhis life. Pitt, now, as he called himself, “a hardened electioneerer,”\r\nentered into the spirit of the warfare, and carried his forces into the\r\nstrongholds of the Whig estates:--\r\n\r\n    “But,” writes Earl Stanhope, “of all the contests of this\r\n    period the most important in that point of view was for the\r\n    county of York. That great county, not yet at election times\r\n    severed into Ridings, had been under the sway of the Whig\r\n    Houses. Bolton Abbey, Castle Howard, and Wentworth Park had\r\n    claimed the right to dictate at the hustings.”\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the country in 1784 rose still higher; the independent\r\nfreeholders of Yorkshire boldly confronted the great Houses, and\r\ninsisted on returning, in conjunction with the heir of Duncombe Park,\r\na banker’s son, of few years and of scarcely tried abilities, though\r\ndestined to a high place in his country’s annals--Mr. Wilberforce.\r\nWith the help of the country gentlemen, they raised the vast sum of\r\n£18,662 for the expense of the election (twenty-one years later this\r\n“vast sum” would not have produced much effect on the same field,\r\nwhen Wilberforce fought, in 1807, what has been described as the\r\n“Austerlitz of electioneering,”--the candidates between them expending\r\nabove three hundred thousand pounds,--the details of which follow in\r\ntheir chronological sequence); and so great was their show of numbers\r\nand of resolution, that the candidates upon the other side did not\r\nventure to stand a contest. Wilberforce was also returned at the\r\nhead of the poll by his former constituents at Hull. “I can never\r\ncongratulate you enough on such glorious success,” wrote the youthful\r\nprime minister to his equally youthful friend. Rank and file, leaders\r\nand spokesmen, of the coalition party fell before the masterly tactics\r\nof the young chief, who stirred the minds of the people by extreme\r\nviews as to England’s sinister future (if the Whigs prevailed) menaced\r\nwith the onslaught of sweeping revolutions, and the destruction of\r\nevery moderate institution and every safeguard of the state. In this\r\nmanner, writes Pitt’s biographer, the party of the opposition was\r\nscattered beyond rallying. “To use a gambling metaphor,” declares\r\nStanhope, “which Fox would not have disdained, many threw down their\r\ncards. Many others played, but lost the rubber.” A witty nickname\r\nwas commonly applied to them. In allusion to the History, written by\r\nJohn Fox, of the sufferers under the Romish persecution, they were\r\ncalled “Fox’s Martyrs;” and of such martyrs there proved to be no less\r\nthan one hundred and sixty. Amidst all these reverses, however, Fox’s\r\nhigh courage never quailed. On the 3rd of April, we find him write\r\nas follows to a friend: “Plenty of bad news from all quarters, but I\r\nthink I feel misfortunes when they come thick have the effect rather of\r\nrousing my spirits than sinking them;”--as set down by Earl Russell in\r\nhis “Memorials.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of the great electioneering contest\r\nof 1784 was the fact of the ex-demagogue Wilkes being returned as\r\nthe ministerial candidate, to Pitt’s pronounced gratification too,\r\nfor the county of Middlesex. But the ways of statesmen are indeed\r\nwonderful and manifold, and Wilkes, the man without prejudices, and\r\nequally unburdened by principles, was an expedient ally (though a\r\nredoubtable foe). Wilkes, very cleverly and plausibly, upon the score\r\nof Pitt’s constant advocacy of Parliamentary Reform, was enabled to\r\npress upon the freeholders of the county of Middlesex the advisability\r\nof extending their entire support to the “virtuous young Minister,”\r\nwhose “liberal and enlightened principles promised to advance the best\r\ninterests of the country.”[61]\r\n\r\n    “Johnny Wilkes, Johnny Wilkes,\r\n          Thou boldest of bilks,\r\n    What a different song you now sing!\r\n      For your dear _Forty-five_,\r\n        ’Tis _Prerogative_!\r\n    And your blasphemy--‘_God save the King_.’”\r\n                                (_The Backstairs Scoured._)\r\n\r\nWilkes having made the most of his patriotism, after being elected lord\r\nmayor, and subsequently obtaining the lucrative and permanent office\r\nof city chamberlain, now exhibited himself in his true colours--a\r\nremarkable instance of tergiversation, disclaiming his own acts, and\r\nmaking no scruple of expressing his contempt for the opinions of his\r\nformer supporters. On his return for Middlesex in 1784, as one of\r\n“the king’s friends,” the democrats represented the king and Wilkes\r\nhanged on one tree, with the inscription, “Give justice her claims.”\r\nThe reconciliation of the “two kings of Brentford” was by no means\r\npopular, and the wits were severe on the fresh departure. One of\r\nthese caricatures, May 1, 1784, is entitled, “The New Coalition.” It\r\nrepresents the King and the ex-archdemagogue fraternally embracing;\r\nWilkes’s cap of liberty is cast to the ground; he declares to his\r\nSovereign, “I now find you are the best of princes.” While great George\r\ndiscovers the erst agitator, his late aversion, “Sure! the worthiest of\r\nsubjects and most virtuous of men!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE NEW COALITION - THE RECONCILIATION OF “THE TWO KINGS OF\r\n    BRENTFORD.” 1784. #/ ]\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox, the most popular Whig statesman of history, was\r\nreturned for Midhurst in May, 1769. He was then only nineteen years and\r\nfour months old; notwithstanding this, he took his seat the November\r\nfollowing, thus becoming a member of parliament before he reached the\r\nage of twenty. Curiously enough, his first speech, March, 9, 1770, was\r\non a point of order, arising out of the Wilkes case and the disputes\r\nof the Middlesex election. In spite of his affected patriotism, Wilkes\r\nmade a jest of his insincerity: standing on the hustings at Brentford,\r\nhis opponent said to him, “I will take the sense of the meeting;” to\r\nwhich the pseudo “champion of liberty” responded, “And I will take the\r\nnonsense, and we shall see who has the best of it.” In the same way he\r\ncoolly disavowed his friend and advocate Serjeant Glynn, his colleague\r\nfor Middlesex, who had fought all his battles through the courts to\r\nthe hustings, and _vice versâ_. Some years later, as related by Earl\r\nRussell, when the “two kings of Brentford” were excellent friends,\r\nand Wilkes, by the irony of fate, became a ministerial candidate, he\r\nwas received at a levée, when George III., with his habitual practice\r\nof asking awkward questions, inquired after Wilkes’s friend, Glynn.\r\n“Sire,” said Wilkes, “he is not a friend of mine; he was a Wilkite,\r\nwhich I never was.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most animated pictures which can be found of the humours of\r\ncanvassing is that drawn from life by William Cowper, at the time the\r\npoet’s mind was influenced to cheerfulness by the company of the lively\r\nLady Austen, who, with the more gravely solicitous Mrs. Unwin, made\r\nOlney an halcyon abode. The year the “Task” was published, and while\r\nCowper was touching up his spirited ballad of “John Gilpin,” he has\r\nset down the visit of an aspiring young senator, no less than Pitt’s\r\ncousin, Mr. W. W. Grenville, who, with a retinue of zealous supporters\r\nat his tail, quite “without your leave,” bursts upon the poet’s\r\nretirement in pursuit of suffrages; this was at the general election of\r\n1784:--\r\n\r\n    “As, when the sea is uncommonly agitated, the water finds\r\n    its way into creeks and holes of rocks, which, in its calmer\r\n    state, it never reaches; in like manner, the effect of these\r\n    turbulent times is felt even at Orchard Side, where in general\r\n    we live as undisturbed by the political element as shrimps or\r\n    cockles that have been accidentally deposited in some hollow\r\n    beyond the water-mark by the usual dashing of the waves. We\r\n    were sitting yesterday after dinner, the two ladies and myself,\r\n    very composedly, and without the least apprehension of any\r\n    such intrusion, in our snug parlour; one lady knitting, the\r\n    other netting, and the gentleman winding worsted, when, to\r\n    our unspeakable surprise, a mob appeared before the window,\r\n    a smart rap was heard at the door, the boys halloed, and the\r\n    maid announced Mr. Grenville. ‘Puss’ [Cowper’s tame hare] was\r\n    unfortunately let out of her box, so that the candidate, with\r\n    all his good friends at his heels, was refused admission at the\r\n    grand entry, and referred to the back door as the only possible\r\n    way of approach. Candidates are not creatures to be very\r\n    susceptible of affronts, and would rather, I suppose, climb in\r\n    at the window than be absolutely excluded. In a minute, the\r\n    yard, the kitchen, and the parlour were filled. Mr. Grenville,\r\n    advancing towards me, shook me by the hand with a degree of\r\n    cordiality that was extremely seducing. As soon as he, and as\r\n    many more as could find chairs, were seated, he began to open\r\n    the intent of his visit. I told him I had no vote, for which\r\n    he readily gave me credit. I assured him I had no influence,\r\n    which he was not equally inclined to believe, and the less, no\r\n    doubt, because Mr. Ashburner, the draper, addressing himself\r\n    to me at this moment, informed me that I had a great deal.\r\n    Supposing that I could not be possessed of such a treasure\r\n    without knowing it, I ventured my first assertion by saying\r\n    that, if I had any, I was utterly at a loss to imagine where it\r\n    could be, or wherein it consisted. Thus ended the conference.\r\n    Mr. Grenville squeezed me by the hand again, kissed the ladies\r\n    and withdrew. He kissed likewise the maid in the kitchen, and\r\n    seemed, upon the whole, a most loving, kissing, kind-hearted\r\n    gentleman. He is very young, genteel, and handsome. He has a\r\n    pair of very good eyes in his head, which not being sufficient,\r\n    as it should seem, for the many nice and difficult purposes\r\n    of a senator, he has a third also, which he wore suspended by\r\n    a riband from his button-hole. The boys hallooed, the dogs\r\n    barked, ‘Puss’ scampered, the hero with his long train of\r\n    obsequious followers withdrew. We made ourselves very merry\r\n    with the adventure, and, in a short time, settled into our\r\n    former tranquillity, never probably to be thus interrupted\r\n    more.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that this persuasive young politician, W. W. Grenville,\r\nsucceeded in securing his return at the top of the poll for the county\r\nof Buckinghamshire in 1784, as Pitt wrote to James Grenville (Lord\r\nGlastonbury)--“William was safe.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOB-REFORMER. 1780.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT WESTMINSTER ELECTION OF 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by Wilkes’s election for Middlesex in 1768\r\nwas forgotten in the great Westminster contest of 1784. Although on\r\neach occasion the conflicts were in opposition to those ministerial\r\ninterests which enlisted the Crown, the courtiers, and the following\r\nof placemen, state pensioners, with both branches of the service upon\r\nthe Tory side in antagonism to popular rights and the freedom of\r\nelection, in both instances of overstrained influence the Government\r\nhad to submit to the mortification of defeat. The circumstances\r\npreceding the Westminster election were exceptional. The Fox and North\r\nCoalition Administration had, by an overstrained exercise of the royal\r\nprerogative, through a “back-stair” Court intrigue, and by defiantly\r\nunconstitutional means on the part of the king, lost their hold on\r\npower, temporarily--as they then supposed--but, as subsequent events\r\nproved, beyond recall.\r\n\r\nFox had introduced his vast measure of reform for the reconstitution of\r\nour Eastern Empire. Passed by the majority commanded by the Coalition\r\nMinistry in the Commons, the Bill was--in direct deference to the\r\nking’s written instructions, freely heralded about--thrown out on the\r\nsecond reading in the Lords. Fox was feared by the king and the East\r\nIndia Company alike; it was apprehended that the great “Carlo Khan”\r\nwas but beginning the work of revolution, and that all charters would\r\nbe in equal jeopardy if that of the East India House was allowed to\r\nbe revised. The wealth of the company was put into requisition to hurl\r\nfrom power the ministers who dared to legislate for the administration\r\nof the huge empire confided to their government; and the king chiefly\r\naimed at the dismissal of the great Whig chief, against whom an\r\nunreasonable prejudice long continued to exist in the royal mind. On\r\nFox’s defeat it was left to Lord Temple to constitute an administration\r\nwhich should satisfy the king; but although this juncture brought\r\nWilliam Pitt to the front, it was found impossible to carry on the\r\nbusiness of the country, the ministry, too weak to divide, being beaten\r\non every measure introduced by their rivals; finally, the opposition\r\nmajority carried the following damaging resolution by nineteen votes:--\r\n\r\n    “That it is the opinion of this House that the continuance of\r\n    the present ministry in power is an obstacle to the formation\r\n    of such an administration as is likely to have the confidence\r\n    of this House and the people.”\r\n\r\nAn address to the king in the same spirit was passed, and similar\r\nmotions and addresses were repeated until parliament was prorogued with\r\na discontented speech from the throne, and it was dissolved on the day\r\nfollowing, March 25, 1874; thus ending for the time this threatening\r\ncontest between the Crown and the most important part of the\r\nlegislature, and transferring the arena of conflict to the hustings.\r\nBy the royal will, Pitt, though only in his twenty-fifth year, was\r\nestablished as Prime Minister of England, uniting in himself the\r\noffices of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer;\r\nhis colleagues being those already known as “the king’s friends,” or\r\nyouthful aspirants to power willing to tread in their steps. At the\r\nelections, the opposition laboured under the disadvantage of leaving\r\nthe patronage of administration in the hands of their antagonists,\r\nand though the contests were obstinate, the Court influence and the\r\nking’s name, which was used openly in defiance of the privileges\r\nof parliament, secured a majority of seats at once, confirming the\r\napprehensions of the Whig party, and fixing Pitt in security at the\r\npinnacle of power. Horace Walpole has pictured the feelings of the\r\nday:--\r\n\r\n    “The Court struck a blow at the Ministers, but it was the gold\r\n    of the East India Company, that nest of monsters (which Fox’s\r\n    Bill was to demolish), that really conjured up the storm, and\r\n    has diffused it all over England. On the other hand Mr. Pitt\r\n    has braved the majority of the House of Commons, has dissolved\r\n    the existent one, and, I doubt, given a wound to that branch\r\n    of the legislature, which, if the tide does not turn, may be\r\n    very fatal to the constitution. The nation is intoxicated, and\r\n    has poured in addresses of thanks to the Crown for exerting\r\n    the prerogative _against_ the palladium of the people. The\r\n    first consequence will probably be, that the Court will have a\r\n    considerable majority upon the new Elections.”\r\n\r\nThe aversion to the late Coalition Ministry was turned to account by\r\nthe Court; the elections showed the opposition, so strong before the\r\ndissolution, in a woeful minority; the great Whig families, Horace\r\nWalpole wrote--\r\n\r\n    “have lost all credit in their own counties; nay, have been\r\n    tricked out of seats where the whole property was their own;\r\n    and, in some of those cases, a _Royal_ finger has too evidently\r\n    tampered, as well as singularly and revengefully towards Lord\r\n    North and Lord Hertford.... Such a proscription, however, must\r\n    have sown so deep resentment as it was not wise to provoke,\r\n    considering that permanent fortune is a jewel that in no Crown\r\n    is the most to be depended upon.”\r\n\r\nThe Westminster election of 1784 was an event of importance in the\r\npolitical history of the last century; it was the only serious check\r\nthat the Court encountered in the attempt to return a subservient House\r\nof Commons; and circumstances combined to render it the most remarkable\r\nstruggle of the kind that has been witnessed. The metropolis was kept\r\nin a state of ebullition for weeks; the poll was opened on April\r\n1st, and continued without intermission until May 17th. During this\r\ntime, Covent Garden and the Strand were the scenes of daily combats\r\nbetween the rival mobs; the papers were filled with squibs of the most\r\npersonal nature, according to their respective sides in politics, and\r\nhundreds of pictorial satires appeared on every incident, and embodying\r\nall the successive stages of the struggle. Rowlandson, who entered\r\nwith spirit into the contest, chiefly in the Foxite interests, alone\r\nproduced on an average a fresh caricature every day; the best of these\r\nare reproduced in the life of the caricaturist, and a selection of\r\nthese subjects, from the work in question, are given among the present\r\nillustrations of the subject. The representatives of Westminster in the\r\nprevious parliament were Fox and Sir Brydges Rodney. Sir Cecil Wray,\r\nlately a follower of the Whig party, had been nominated for the last\r\nparliament by the Whig chief, but on this occasion Wray ungratefully\r\ndeserted his political leader, and was put forward as the ministerial\r\nnominee. The king and Court had resolved to exert every influence to\r\ncause Fox’s defeat on personal grounds. Admiral Lord Hood was also a\r\nCourt candidate, but it was Wray who was more especially held forth\r\nas the antagonist of the “Man of the People.” The political apostate\r\nwas stigmatized as “Judas Iscariot, who betrayed his master.” Other\r\ncharges against him were certain proposals he is said to have made\r\nfor the suppression of Chelsea Hospital and a project for a tax upon\r\nmaid-servants; to these were added the general cries against his\r\nsupporters of attempting an undue elevation of the prerogative, and\r\nalso against the prevalent “back-stair” influence.\r\n\r\nAgainst Fox was raised the odium of the coalition with Lord North,\r\nand his attack on the East India Company’s charter was represented\r\nas but the commencement of a general invasion of chartered rights of\r\ncorporate bodies. The Prince of Wales interested himself warmly in\r\nfavour of Fox, to the extreme provocation of the king and queen; it was\r\ndeclared that the prince had canvassed in person, and that the members\r\nof his household were actively engaged in promoting the success of\r\nthe Whig chief. The exertions of the Court were extraordinary; almost\r\nhourly intelligence was conveyed to the king, who is said to have been\r\naffected in the most evident manner by every change in the state of\r\nthe poll. Threats and promises were freely made in the royal name, the\r\nold illegalities were revived, members of the king’s household claimed\r\nvotes, and on one occasion two hundred and eighty of the Guards were\r\nsent in a body to give their votes as householders--an ill-advised\r\nmanœuvre, upon which, as Horace Walpole declared, his father, Sir\r\nRobert, would not have dared to venture in the most quiet seasons. All\r\ndependents on the Court were commanded to vote on the same side as the\r\nsoldiers. When Fox’s friends, the popular party, protested against this\r\nunconstitutional interference, their opponents retaliated by charging\r\nthe Foxites with bribery, and with resorting to improper influences\r\nof extravagant kinds. Beyond the unpopularity of relying upon Court\r\npatronage and the imputations of “wearing two faces under a Hood,” and\r\nbeing “a Greenwich pensioner,” Admiral Lord Hood escaped; the most\r\nbitter party and personal attacks were made upon Wray. At the beginning\r\nof the election, Hood had brought up a large contingent of sailors, or,\r\nas the opposition alleged, chiefly hired ruffians dressed in sailors’\r\nclothes; these desperadoes surrounded the hustings, and intimidated\r\nFox’s friends, and even hindered those who attempted to register\r\nvotes in favour of the Whig chief; they grew uproarious as the poll\r\nprogressed, and, parading the streets, assaulted Fox’s partisans, made\r\nconspicuous by displaying his “true blue” favours; they also attacked\r\nthe Shakespeare Tavern, where his committee met, when, threatening to\r\nwreck the house, they were beaten off by the inmates. After a reign of\r\nterror, which was endured for four days without organized resistance,\r\nthe sailor mob encountered a rival faction--entitled the “honest mob”\r\nby the opposition newspapers,--these were the hackney chairmen, a\r\nnumerous body, chiefly Irishmen, almost unanimous in their support of\r\nFox; these, with hearty will, basted the sailors, breaking heads and\r\nfracturing bones in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. The sailors\r\nthence proceeded to St. James’s, where the chairmen chiefly plied for\r\nhire, to wreak vengeance on their chairs; but the Irishmen beat them\r\nagain and the Guards quelled the riot. The day following, both parties\r\nwere reinforced. The sailors, vowing vengeance, left the hustings to\r\nintercept Fox on his way to Westminster to canvass; but he luckily\r\nmanaged to elude them, and escaped into a private house. The sailor\r\nmob returned to Covent Garden, where they encountered the “honest\r\nmob,” the chairmen being joined by a multitude of butchers, brewers’\r\nmen, and others. A series of pitched battles ensued, the sailors were\r\ndefeated at each renewal of the fighting, and, finally, many of their\r\nnumber being carried off to hospitals severely injured, the popular\r\nrival mob was left in possession of the field. Special constables\r\nwere now introduced at the instance of the justices of the peace, who\r\nwere in the Court interest, to surround the places where Hood and\r\nWray’s committees met, and these behaved in a manner so hostile to\r\nFox’s party, going about impeding and insulting Liberal voters, and\r\nshouting “No Fox,” that their presence provoked a fresh outbreak.\r\nOn the approach of the “honest mob,” heralded by the sounds of the\r\nmarrow-bones and cleavers, the insurrectionary signal, the constables\r\nmade an attack, in which one of their own body was knocked down and\r\nkilled by fellow-constables by mistake in the heat of the scuffle.\r\n\r\nIn Rowlandson’s pictorial versions of the different stages of this\r\nfamous election, the public were first excited against the Coalition\r\nMinistry, lately thrown out of office as described. “They Quarter their\r\nArms” represents the contracting parties, Fox and Badger, united to\r\nshare the Treasury spoils, and battening on the victimized John Bull;\r\nit was “money” which made the Coalition Wedding:--\r\n\r\n    “Come, we’re all rogues together,\r\n      The people must pay for the play;\r\n    Then let us make hay in fine weather,\r\n      And keep the cold winter away.”\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the Coalition was pictured as “Britannia Aroused;\r\nor, the Coalition Ministers Destroyed,” in which Fox and North are\r\nfiguratively reaping the reward of iniquity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COALITION WEDDING--THE FOX (C. J. FOX) AND THE\r\nBADGER (LORD NORTH) QUARTER THEIR ARMS ON JOHN BULL. BY T. ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n    “Now Fox, North, and Burke, each one is a brother,\r\n    So honest, they swear, there is not such another;\r\n    No longer they tell us we’re going to ruin,\r\n    The people they _serve_ in whatever they’re doing.”]\r\n\r\n    “Within the Senate, and without,\r\n      Our credit fails; th’ enlighten’d nation\r\n    The boasted Coalition scout,\r\n      And hunt us from th’ administration.\r\n\r\n    “Fox, let thy soul with _grace_ be fill’d:\r\n      Expect no other _call_ but mine;\r\n    With penitence I see thee thrill’d,\r\n      With new-born light I see thee shine.\r\n\r\n    “How spruce will North beneath thee sit!\r\n      With joy officiate as thy clerk!\r\n    Attune the hymn, renounce his wit,\r\n      And carol like the morning lark!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    BRITANNIA AROUSED, OR THE COALITION MONSTERS DESTROYED. BY T.\r\n    ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n“These were your Ministers.”]\r\n\r\nThe astute young premier, whose youth at this time was alleged as his\r\nchief crime, began to bid for “loyal addresses,” and other servile\r\nexpressions, to condone the rash experiments recently attempted upon\r\nthe constitution. With this view he cultivated the citizens, and,\r\nbeing presented with the “Freedom of the City,” he was entertained by\r\nthe Grocers’ Company as the son of that famous Earl of Chatham, the\r\ngreatest friend of the rights of the people; it was expected he would\r\nbe equally steadfast in defending popular freedom:--\r\n\r\n    “But Chatham, thank heaven! has left us a son;\r\n    When _he_ takes the helm, we are sure not undone;\r\n    The glory his father revived of the land,\r\n    And Britannia has taken Pitt by the hand.”\r\n\r\nIn “Master Billy’s Procession to Grocers’ Hall” the adulation of the\r\nmultitude is offered to the “charming youth,” who is declared to\r\nbe “very like his father;” the gold box is carried before, and the\r\nvoluntary slaves who are harnessed to his chariot are shouting for\r\n“Pitt and Prerogative.”\r\n\r\nBefore the dissolution (March 25th), Pitt’s ministerial manœuvres were\r\nalready patent to all. The king had determined, with the obstinacy of\r\npurpose which characterized the royal mind, that he would endure any\r\nsacrifice rather than sanction the return of the members of the late\r\nCoalition Ministry to power; in the face of this eventuality, he even\r\nthreatened, it is stated, to retire to Hanover, but, in the meanwhile,\r\nno effort was spared to obviate this embarrassing emergency. Places\r\nand pensions were freely employed as baits to detach followers of\r\nFox and North. A pictorial version of the situation, as given\r\nby Rowlandson, represents the extensive “ratting” system and its\r\n_modus operandi_, under the title of “The Apostate Jack Robinson, the\r\nPolitical Rat-catcher. N.B. _Rats taken alive!_”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. ROWLANDSON: MASTER BILLY’S PROCESSION TO GROCERS’\r\nHALL--PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS--PITT PRESENTED WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE\r\nCITY, 1784.\r\n\r\n    “The City interests and votes, young Pitt would fain obtain.\r\n    For Freedom of the City, too, he does not sue in vain;\r\n    So Master Billy goes in state a Grocer to be made,\r\n    ‘A fig for Fox,’ the Premier cries, ‘I’ve pushed him out of trade.’”\r\n\r\n  [_Page 264._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. ROWLANDSON: THE APOSTATE JACK ROBINSON, THE POLITICAL\r\nRAT-CATCHER. 1784.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 265._]\r\n\r\n    “Thus when Renegado sees a Rat\r\n      In the traps in the morning taken,\r\n    With pleasure he goes Master Pitt to pat,\r\n      And swears he will have his bacon.”\r\n\r\nJack Robinson, as “Rat-catcher to Great Britain,” is equipped for\r\nhis delicate task with a supply of baits, lures, and traps; round\r\nhis waist is the “Cestus of Corruption,” in his pocket is a small\r\naide-de-camp, who is made to exclaim, “We’ll ferret them out!” On\r\nhis back is a double trap, baited with coronets and places; he is\r\ncautiously proceeding on all fours, along the Treasury floor, where\r\n“vermin” are “preserved;” the rats to be captured are toying with the\r\ngold laid down to attract them. To the nose of one veteran, whose face\r\nresembles the spectacled visage of Edmund Burke, is held a large bait\r\nof “pension,” which is regarded wistfully by other rats assembled.\r\nUnder the heading of “Rats of Note,” a placard on the wall announces\r\nthe list of political apostates who have been captured. No concealment\r\nwas attempted, for we find in the pages of the _Morning Post and Daily\r\nAdvertiser_, for February 10, 1784, an advertisement, under the simple\r\nheading of “Jack Robinson,” with a woodcut representing a string of\r\nrats, such as might preface a common rat-catcher’s announcement, giving\r\nthe names of twenty-two parliamentary rats already decoyed from their\r\nparty allegiance to go over to the good pickings the king was able to\r\nhold out. This curious notification is repeated on the Treasury wall,\r\nshown in Rowlandson’s pictorial view of the corruption abroad, as a\r\npreparation for the coming elections.\r\n\r\nThe _dramatis personæ_ of the great performance at the Covent Garden\r\nhustings are exhibited as “The Rival Candidates:” “Themistocles,” Lord\r\nHood; “Demosthenes,” Fox; “Judas Iscariot,” Sir Cecil Wray.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HONEST SAM HOUSE, THE PATRIOTIC PUBLICAN, CANVASSER FOR\r\nFOX.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most enthusiastic partisans of Fox, and second only to his\r\nfair friends, the ladies of the Whig aristocracy, in popular influence,\r\nwas “Honest Sam House,” the publican, remarkable for his oddity and\r\nfor his political zeal, who during the election not only canvassed\r\nwith admirable tact, but throughout the contest kept open house at his\r\nown expense, and was honoured with the presence of many of the Whig\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n    “See the brave Sammy House, he’s as still as a mouse,\r\n      And does canvass with prudence so clever:\r\n    See what shoals with him flock, to poll for brave Fox,\r\n      Give thanks to Sam House, boys, for ever, for ever,\r\n      Give thanks to Sam House, boys, for ever!\r\n\r\n    “Brave bald-headed Sam, all must own is the man,\r\n      Who does canvass for brave Fox so clever;\r\n    His aversion, I say, is to _small beer and Wray_!\r\n      May his bald head be honour’d for ever, for ever!\r\n      May his bald head be honour’d for ever!”\r\n\r\nThe fact that the public was being treated to the excitement of perhaps\r\nthe most momentous and embittered, if not the hardest-fought election\r\non record, is shown in Rowlandson’s version of the Covent Garden\r\nHustings, round which is assembled a crowd of persons who are being\r\naddressed from the platform, whereon stands one of the ministerial\r\ncandidates, Admiral Lord Hood, who is made to announce his intention\r\nof carrying “two faces under a Hood!” This caricature is a pointed\r\ncomment upon the Court manœuvres, and exposes those royal tactics\r\nwhich had already demoralized the allies of the defunct Coalition\r\nMinistry. Major John Cartwright--the consistent and energetic advocate\r\nof reform, of which he was one of the most valorous pioneers--is made\r\nthe mouth-piece of the artist’s satirical strictures, while endorsing\r\nthose views held by “The Drum-Major of Sedition” (March 29, 1784), as\r\nthe liberty-loving major, who remained conspicuous in the foremost\r\nranks of reformers all his days, was entitled by his adversaries. A\r\nstrongly ironical tendency characterizes the speech, which may be\r\nregarded as a tolerably pungent electioneering squib:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Themistocles._\r\n  Lord Hood.\r\n\r\n  _Demosthenes._\r\n  Charles James Fox.\r\n\r\n  _Judas Iscariot._\r\n  Sir Cecil Wray.\r\n\r\nT.

This,\r\n    gentlemen, is the last time of asking, as we are determined\r\n    to abolish the power of the House of Commons, and in future\r\n    be governed by Prerogative, as they are in France and Turkey.\r\n    Gentlemen, the ambition of the enemy is now evident. Has he\r\n    not, within these few days past, stole the Great Seal of\r\n    England” (this had actually occurred, the great seal being\r\n    mysteriously carried off on the eve of the dissolution, which\r\n    had to be postponed until another seal could be made to\r\n    replace the missing instrument) “while the Chancellor[62] was\r\n    taking a bottle with a female favourite, as all great men do?\r\n    I am informed, gentlemen, that the enemy now assumes Regal\r\n    Authority, and, by virtue of the Great Seal (which he stole),\r\n    is creating of Peers and granting of pensions. A most shameful\r\n    abuse, gentlemen, of that instrument. If you assist us to\r\n    pull down the House of Commons, every person who hears me has\r\n    a chance of becoming a great man, if he is happy enough to hit\r\n    the fancy of Lord Bute and of Mr. Jenkinson.[63] Huzza! God\r\n    save the King!”\r\n\r\nPitt’s valour, then deemed intemperate, in taking up the reins of\r\noffice by “the royal will,” and thereby jockeying the discomfited\r\nex-Coalition Ministry, is commented upon by Rowlandson in the course\r\nof his numerous caricatures on the great Westminster election. “The\r\nHanoverian Horse and the British Lion; a scene in a new play, lately\r\nacted at Westminster with distinguished applause. Act ii., scene\r\nlast” (March 31, 1784), is a version intended to be prophetic of the\r\nend, a view then warranted by circumstances, but one falsified by\r\nthe results of the general election, which consolidated the power\r\nin Pitt’s hands, and completely left the opposition “out in the\r\ncold!” a surprise by no means anticipated at the date of the cartoon\r\nin question. The Parliament-house is shown as the arena of this\r\nconstitutional tournament, and the faithful Commons are victimized by\r\nthe aggressive tendencies of Pitt’s steed; the White Horse of Hanover\r\nis trampling upon “Magna Charta,” the “Bill of Rights,” and mangling\r\nthe “Constitution.” Pitt, a remarkably light and boyish jockey, is\r\nexciting the brute, who is neighing, “Pre-ro-ro-ro-ro-rogative” with\r\nvicious energy. The youthful premier is enjoying the capers of his\r\nmount: “Bravo! go it again; I love to ride a mettle steed. Send the\r\nvagabonds packing.” The heels of the White Horse are effectually\r\nscaring the members and making a clearance. The British Lion has\r\ndescended from his familiar post as a supporter of the royal ’scutcheon\r\nover the Speaker’s chair; in the vacant space lately occupied by the\r\nBritish Lion is the announcement, “We shall resume our situation here\r\nat pleasure.--Leo Rex.” The sturdy figure of the Whig Chief is safely\r\nmounted upon the British Lion, who is keeping a watchful eye upon\r\nhis Hanoverian rival, while protesting, “If this horse is not tamed,\r\nhe will soon be absolute king of our forest.” Fox has entered on the\r\nscene of conflict, armed for the encounter with bit, bridle, and a\r\nstout riding-whip, to tame and control the uproarious White Horse; he\r\nis volunteering advice to his upstart rival, “Prithee, Billy, dismount\r\nbefore ye get a fall--and let some abler jockey take your seat!” Fox\r\nwas reckoning without his “Martyrs,” which the results of the election\r\nwere destined to create on an unprecedented scale, as this review will\r\nshow. The reverse was shortly to be realized, as set down pictorially\r\nby Rowlandson. The poll was opened April 1, and three days later\r\nappeared a version of Fox as “The Incurable,” in a strait-waistcoat,\r\nand with straw in his hair, singing:--\r\n\r\n    “My lodging is on the cold ground, and very hard is my case,\r\n    But that which grieves me most of all is the losing of my place.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. ROWLANDSON: THE HANOVERIAN HORSE AND THE BRITISH\r\nLION. MARCH, 1784.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 268._]\r\n\r\nThe royal physician, Dr. Munro, is examining the patient through\r\nhis eye-glass, and attesting, “As I have not the least hope of his\r\nrecovery, let him be removed amongst the Incurables.”\r\n\r\n    “Dazzled with hope, he could not see the cheat\r\n    Of aiming with impatience to be great.\r\n    With wild ambition in his heart, we find,\r\n    Farewell content and quiet of his mind;\r\n    For glittering clouds he left the solid shore,\r\n    And wonted happiness returns no more.”\r\n\r\nThe most active and successful of Fox’s canvassers was undoubtedly the\r\nDuchess of Devonshire, who, by the influence of her personal charms\r\nand her winning affability, succeeded in procuring for the Whig chief\r\nvotes which would never have otherwise been polled in his favour. It\r\nwas of the beautiful and winsome Georgiana Spencer, that Hannay said\r\nthe Spencers had laid the world under further obligations by sending\r\nforth a second “Fairy Queen,” and it was the Westminster Election of\r\n1784 which first brought into celebrity this gay and graceful leader\r\nof fashion, who, by universal suffrage, was the Queen of the Foxites.\r\nIn the earlier stages Fox was behind both his opponents, and although\r\nCecil Wray had only a small majority, Fox was at his last gasp. The\r\nstory is told in Wraxall’s “Posthumous Memoirs” by an eye-witness of\r\nthe incidents:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVONSHIRE, OR MOST APPROVED MANNER OF SECURING\r\nVOTES. 1784. BY T. ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n    “However courtiers take offence,\r\n      And cits and prudes may join, Sir,\r\n    Beauty will ever influence\r\n      The free and generous mind, Sir.\r\n\r\n    “Fair DEVON, like the rising sun,\r\n      Proceeds in her full glory,\r\n    Whilst Madam’s duller orb must own\r\n      The Duchess moves before her.”]\r\n\r\n    “The party were driven to new resources, and the Duchess\r\n    of Devonshire restored the fates of the Whig champion. The\r\n    progress of the canvass thenceforward is amusing. The entire\r\n    of the voters for Westminster having been exhausted, the\r\n    only hope was in exciting the suburbs. The Duchess instantly\r\n    ordered out her equipage, and with her sister, the Countess of\r\n    Duncannon, drove, polling list in hand, to the houses of the\r\n    voters. Entreaties, ridicule, civilities, influence of all\r\n    kinds were lavished on these rough legislators; and the novelty\r\n    of being solicited by two women of rank and remarkable fashion,\r\n    took the popular taste universally. The immediate result was,\r\n    that they gallantly came to the poll, and Fox, who had been a\r\n    hundred behind Sir Cecil, speedily left him a hundred behind\r\n    in return. An imperfect attempt was made on the hostile side\r\n    to oppose this new species of warfare by similar captivation,\r\n    and Lady Salisbury was moved to awake the dying fortunes of the\r\n    Government candidate. But the effort failed; it was imitation,\r\n    it was too late; and the Duchess was six-and-twenty, and Lady\r\n    Salisbury thirty-four! These are reasons enough, and more than\r\n    enough for the rejection of any man from the hustings.”\r\n\r\n    “A certain lady I won’t name\r\n      Must take an active part, sir,\r\n    To show that DEVON’S beauteous dame\r\n      Should not engage each heart, sir.\r\n\r\n    “She canvass’d all, both great and small,\r\n      And thundered at each door, sir;\r\n    She rummaged every shop and stall--\r\n      The Duchess had been before her.”\r\n\r\nThe Tories were furious at the success of the duchess, who, attended\r\nby several beauties of the Whig aristocracy, and, among others, by\r\nthe fascinating Lady Carlisle, carried all before her; another rival\r\ncanvasser, in addition to the “Diana of Hatfield,” was set up in the\r\nperson of the Hon. Mrs. Hobart, Lady Buckinghamshire, of “Pic-nic”\r\nfame, who, though “fat and fair,” was under “forty,” and remarkably\r\nvolatile, but, being of portly figure, this dashing lady, a connection\r\nof Pitt’s, was by the opposition nicknamed “Madame Blubber,” and the\r\ncaricaturists, who represent her as canvassing for Hood and Wray, with\r\na weighty purse by way of inducement, make the electors on whom she\r\nhas tried her persuasive powers unanimous in asserting “I’m engaged\r\nto the Duchess.” Mrs. Hobart was, however, looked upon as a rival of\r\nthe gracious Georgiana, and many satirical shafts, both by verse and\r\npicture, were launched at her full-blown charms. Balloons, as novelties\r\nat that time, were exciting a share of attention, and Madame Blubber as\r\nthe “Ærostatic Dilly,” was, as a balloon “launched at Richmond Park,”\r\nshown in mid-air, convoying to the hustings outlying and dependent\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n          “Tho’ in every street\r\n          All the voters you meet\r\n    The Duchess knows best how to court them,\r\n          Yet for outlying votes\r\n          In my petticoats,\r\n    I’ve found out a way to transport them!\r\n\r\n          “Eight trips in this way,\r\n          For Hood and for Wray,\r\n    I’ll make poll sixteen in one day.\r\n          Dear Wray, don’t despair,\r\n          My supplies by the air\r\n    Shall recover our losses on Monday!”\r\n\r\nWalpole wrote under date, April 13th:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Fox has all the popularity in Westminster; and, indeed,\r\n    is so amiable and winning that, could he have stood in person\r\n    all over England, I question whether he would not have carried\r\n    the parliament. The beldams hate him; but most of the pretty\r\n    women in England are indefatigable in making interest for him;\r\n    the Duchess of Devonshire in particular. I am ashamed to say\r\n    how coarsely she has been received by some worse than tars. But\r\n    nothing has shocked me so much as what I heard this morning. At\r\n    Dover, they roasted a poor _fox_ alive by the most diabolical\r\n    allegory--a savage meanness that an Iroquois could not have\r\n    committed!” “During her canvass the Duchess made no scruple of\r\n    visiting the humblest of the electors, dazzling and enchanting\r\n    them by the fascination of her manner, the power of her beauty\r\n    and the influence of her high rank, and sometimes carrying off\r\n    to the hustings the meanest mechanic in her own carriage.”\r\n\r\n    “The Duchess of Devonshire,” writes Lord Cornwallis, on the\r\n    19th of April, “is indefatigable in her canvass for Fox. She\r\n    was in the most blackguard houses in Long Acre by eight o’clock\r\n    this morning.”\r\n\r\nThe fact of the duchess having purchased the vote of an impracticable\r\nbutcher by a kiss is said to be unquestionable. It was on one of these\r\noccasions that the well-known compliment is said to have been made her\r\nby an Irish mechanic, “_I could light my pipe at your eyes_.”\r\n\r\nOf great beauty and unconquerable spirit, she tried all her powers of\r\npersuasion on the shopkeepers of Westminster, as Earl Stanhope declares\r\nin his “Life of Pitt”:--\r\n\r\n    “Other ladies, who could not rival her beauty, might at least\r\n    follow her example. Scarce a street or alley which they did not\r\n    canvass on behalf of him whom they persisted in calling the\r\n    ‘Man of the People,’ at the very moment when the popular voice\r\n    was declaring against him.”\r\n\r\nPitt and his royal patron were, however, exerting every method to\r\nsecure the downfall of the redoubtable “Carlo Khan.” Up to the third\r\nday of the polling, “Fox was in a minority, notwithstanding the immense\r\nexertions that were made on his behalf. The Ministerial Party,”\r\naccording to the statement of their own historians, “were sanguine in\r\nthe hope of wresting from him the greatest and most enlightened, as\r\nit was then considered, of all the represented boroughs of England.”\r\nPitt’s proud spirit was roused at the obstinacy of the contest, and,\r\nunlike his more magnanimous if not greater rival, he lost patience\r\nwith his opponents; in a strain of acrimonious pleasantry he wrote\r\nto Wilberforce, “Westminster goes on well in spite of the Duchess of\r\nDevonshire and the other _Women of the People_, but when the poll will\r\nclose is uncertain;” this was on the seventh day of the poll, and Pitt\r\nthen little dreamt of its running for forty days uninterruptedly. By\r\nthe 23rd of April, the premier was evidently losing temper, and the\r\nstrain of electioneering was becoming tenser, as appears from a letter\r\nwritten to his cousin, James Grenville, afterwards Lord Glastonbury:--\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    “Admiral Hood tells me he left Lord Nugent at Bath, disposed\r\n    to come to town if a vote at Westminster should be material. I\r\n    think from the state of the poll it may be very much so. There\r\n    is no doubt, I believe, of final success on a scrutiny, if we\r\n    are driven to it; but it is a great object to us to carry the\r\n    return for both in the first instance, and on every account\r\n    as great an object to Fox to prevent it. It is uncertain\r\n    how long the poll will continue, but pretty clear it cannot\r\n    be over till after Monday. If you will have the goodness to\r\n    state these circumstances to Lord Nugent, and encourage his\r\n    good designs, we shall be very much obliged to you; and still\r\n    more, should neither health nor particular engagements detain\r\n    you, if, besides prevailing upon him, you could give your own\r\n    personal assistance. At all events I hope you will forgive\r\n    my troubling you, and allow for the importunity of a hardened\r\n    electioneerer.... Mainwaring and Wilkes are considerably ahead\r\n    in Middlesex, and Lord Grimston has come in, instead of Halsey,\r\n    for Herts.”\r\n\r\nPitt further alludes to W. W. Grenville, his cousin, “the kissing young\r\ngentleman” who visited Cowper in the course of his canvass, “I have\r\nnot yet heard the event of Bucks, but William was safe, and, by the\r\nfirst day’s poll, Aubrey’s prospect seems very good.” John Aubrey was\r\nreturned second, and William Grenville was at the head of the poll.\r\n\r\nFox’s prospects were gradually improved as concerned his own seat at\r\nWestminster; but the slaughter amongst his followers was altogether\r\nunexampled, the muster-roll of “Fox’s Martyrs” grew ominously longer as\r\neach election was determined. On the twenty-third day of the polling at\r\nCovent Garden the Whig chief passed Sir Cecil Wray, and continued to\r\nadvance until the fortieth, when, by law, the contest closed. On the\r\n17th of May, the poll stood--Lord Hood, 6,694; Fox, 6,237; Sir Cecil\r\nWray, 5,998.\r\n\r\n    “There was,” writes Earl Stanhope, “strong reason, however,\r\n    to suspect many fraudulent practices in the previous days,\r\n    since it seemed clear that the total number of votes recorded\r\n    was considerably beyond the number of persons entitled\r\n    to the franchise. For this reason Sir Cecil Wray at once\r\n    demanded a scrutiny, and the High Bailiff--illegally, as Fox\r\n    contended--granted the request. But further still, the High\r\n    Bailiff, Mr. Corbett, who was no friend to Fox, refused to\r\n    make any legal return until this scrutiny should be decided.\r\n    Thus Westminster was left for the present destitute of\r\n    Representatives, and Fox would have been without a seat in the\r\n    new Parliament but for the friendship of Sir Thomas Dundas,\r\n    through which he had been already returned the member for the\r\n    close boroughs of Kirkwall.”\r\n\r\nGallant Whig poetasters were rapturous in their praises of the fair\r\ncanvassers who were making such havoc in the Tory ranks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIT’S LAST STAKE; OR, THE COBBLING VOTER AND ABJECT\r\nCANVASSERS.

The\r\npractice of claiming some slight service, rewarded at election times\r\nwith extravagant liberality, as a subterfuge for bribery, is shown\r\nin the duchess engaging an elector to put a stitch in her shoe, and\r\nillustrated as “The Wit’s Last Stake; or, the Cobbling Voter and Abject\r\nCanvassers.”\r\n\r\nBesides “The Devonshire, or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes,”\r\ntwo caricatures appeared on the 12th of April from Rowlandson’s\r\nprolific graver: one, exhibiting the struggle between the fair\r\ncanvassers arrayed in rivalry at Covent Garden hustings, under the\r\nsymbol of “The Poll:” a balancing plank, whereon the beauteous\r\nGeorgiana “Devon’s Queen,” is elevated high in the air, while her\r\nstouter rival, the Hon. Mrs. Hobart (Lady Buckinghamshire), is\r\noverweighing her extremely. Above the heads of the group, which\r\nincludes the rival candidates, Fox, Hood, and Wray, flutters a placard,\r\n“The Rival Candidates, a Farce.” Against Wray was revived, in allusion\r\nto the Court patronage under which he was fighting, the well-worn cry\r\nof “Slavery and wooden shoes,” and much stress was laid on the extreme\r\nmeasure of polling the Guards as householders; in reference to the two\r\nhundred and eighty votes given by soldiers at one time in a body--an\r\nastounding manœuvre, which shocked constitutional minds--appeared the\r\nplacard:--\r\n\r\n    “All Horse Guards, Grenadier Guards, Foot Guards, and\r\n    Black-Guards, that have not polled for the destruction of\r\n    Chelsea Hospital and the Tax on Maidservants are desired to\r\n    meet at the _Gutter Hole_, opposite the Horse Guards, where\r\n    they will have a full bumper of _knock-me-down_ and plenty of\r\n    _soap-suds_, before they go to the poll for Sir Cecil Wray\r\n    or eat. N.B.--Those who have no shoes or stockings may come\r\n    without, _there being a quantity of wooden shoes provided for\r\n    them_.”\r\n\r\nA further presentment of the famous canvassing duchess, whose\r\nprominence at the great Westminster election of 1784 gave her such\r\nuniversal and lasting celebrity, is offered by Rowlandson in a fanciful\r\ndomestic interior at Devonshire House, where the favoured candidate,\r\nFox, and his staunch and invaluable ally, “brave Sammy House,” are\r\nintroduced as “Lords of the Bedchamber” (April 14, 1784). In the\r\ncaricaturist’s highly imaginary version, the duchess is entertaining\r\nthe pair with a cup of tea in her boudoir; above her hangs the Reynolds\r\nportrait of her liege-lord. Sam House, in his publican’s jacket,\r\notherwise attired in that neat costume which became historical, is\r\nstirring the cup “that cheers but not inebriates” with an air of\r\nsupreme contentment, while Fox is patting, in friendly familiarity, the\r\nno less remarkable completely bald head of his indefatigable supporter\r\nby way of encouragement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sam House.

ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 277._]\r\n\r\nThe third plate, “The Westminster Watchman,” is inscribed--\r\n\r\n    “To the Independent Electors of Westminster, this Print of\r\n    their staunch old watchman, the guardian of their rights and\r\n    privileges, is dedicated by a grateful Elector. N.B.--Beware of\r\n    Counterfeits, as the Greenwich and Chelsea Watchmen are upon\r\n    the look-out!”\r\n\r\nFox is standing firm, with his cap of “Liberty;” and the lamp of\r\n“Truth” is shedding its light around, the Whig chief is unmoved by the\r\nstorm of “ministerial thunderbolts;” a trusty dog, “Vigilance,” is by\r\nhis side; the “Counterfeits” are shuffling off, Hood for Greenwich, and\r\nWray for Chelsea.\r\n\r\nThe ballads, epigrams, and poetical _jeux d’esprit_ to which the\r\ncircumstances of this famous contest gave birth are sufficiently\r\nnumerous to fill a volume. The rhymsters on both sides were evidently\r\nresolved to do their best: many of the lyrics and “squibs” are worthy\r\nof preservation; they are as a rule far above the average compositions\r\nevoked upon similar occasions. The tuneful songster, Captain Morris,\r\nwrote many of the most graceful and witty “impromptus” and verses. The\r\nbards of “Opposition” were severe upon the Court influence exerted\r\nagainst Fox’s cause, and justly exposed some of the manœuvres resorted\r\nto by Pitt’s adherents.\r\n\r\n    “To the will of the Court we are told to consent,\r\n      And never to do as we please, Sir;\r\n    If we vote against FOX we’re forgiven our rent,\r\n      Or else we must forfeit our lease, Sir.\r\n    Thus of freedom and rights poor electors they chouse,\r\n      Such slaves and such fools we are grown, Sir,\r\n    We must vote a Rogue into the Parliament House,\r\n      Or else be turned out of our own, Sir.”\r\n\r\nIt was the old story of intimidation, undue influence, and coercion, as\r\npractised at the Westminster elections for the best part of a century.\r\nThe scene of the hustings is thus sketched:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A CONCISE DESCRIPTION OF COVENT GARDEN AT THE PRESENT WESTMINSTER\r\nELECTION.\r\n\r\n    “A paradise for fools and knaves;\r\n    A hell for constables and slaves;\r\n    A booth for mountebanks and beavers;\r\n    A shop for marrow-bones and cleavers;\r\n    A stage for bulls and Irish chairmen;\r\n    A pit for Foxes, for to rear ’em:\r\n    In short, such are most glorious places(?)\r\n    For Duchesses to show their faces!”\r\n\r\nAllusions to the machinations of “the King’s Friends” were abundant:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“STANZAS IN SEASON.\r\n\r\n    “It would not do! Black Thurlow’s frown\r\n      And Billy’s prudence gain’d the prize;\r\n    ’Tis Beauty must redeem the crown,\r\n      And Fox must reign thro’ Devon’s eyes.\r\n    She saw, she conquer’d; Wray shrunk back;\r\n      Court mandates we no more obey;\r\n    Majorities no more they pack,\r\n      And Fox and Freedom win the day!\r\n    Who can deny when beauty sues?\r\n      And where’s the tongue can blame her Grace;\r\n    Not timid slavery can refuse:\r\n      Her life’s as spotless as her face.”\r\n\r\nThe countenance shown to Fox by the youthful rank, fashion, and\r\nwealth of the day excited the bitterness of Tory rhymsters. The\r\nactive partisanship of the Prince of Wales was a source of caustic\r\nrecrimination and envy:--\r\n\r\n    “Since Britain’s great Prince condescends to evince\r\n      His concern in your future election,\r\n    How happy each Cobbler, Butcher, Smith, and Pot-wobbler,\r\n      Who shall merit the Royal protection!\r\n\r\n    “For goodness consider the rank of the bidder,\r\n      Who offers so much for your plumpers:\r\n    What’s the Nation or Pitt, to the Prince and Tom Tit!\r\n      Dash such stuff--and to Fox fill your bumpers.”\r\n\r\nArrayed on the Whig chief’s side was all the beauty and grace of fair\r\nand fascinating wives and daughters of the Whig aristocracy, a bevy of\r\nlovely political Circes, whose enchantments were all potent:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON SEEING LADY BEAUCHAMP, LADY CARLISLE, AND LADY DERBY IN THEIR\r\nCARRIAGES, ON MR. FOX’S SIDE OF THE HUSTINGS.\r\n\r\n    “The gentle Beauchamp, and the fair Carlisle,\r\n      Around their favour’d Fox expectant wait;\r\n    And Derby’s lip suspends the ready smile,\r\n      To ask ‘the Poll?’ and ‘what is Charles’s fate?’\r\n\r\n    “But say, ye _belles_, whose beauty all admit,\r\n      Do you in politics dispute the prize;\r\n    Or do ye near the Hustings proudly sit,\r\n      To take the _suffrage_ of admiring eyes?“\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Devonshire was idolized by enthusiastic Whigs, who\r\nhailed in her the salvation of the cause:--\r\n\r\n    “Let Pitt and Wray dislike the fair,\r\n      Decry our Devon’s matchless merit;\r\n    A braver, kinder soul we wear,\r\n      And love her _beauty_, love her _spirit_.\r\n    Let distant times and ages know,\r\n      When Temple would have made us slaves,\r\n    ’Tis thus we ward the fatal blow,\r\n      ’Tis Fox that beats--’tis Devon saves!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON SEEING THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE, LADY DUNCANNON, ETC., CANVASSING\r\nFOR MR.

BY T. ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 281._]\r\n\r\nAlthough every concession was made to the empire of Beauty, many of\r\nthe verses were slyly sarcastic, while some of the caricatures were\r\nstrongly coloured by the uncompromising coarseness of the age:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ODE TO THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n    “Hail, Duchess! first of womankind,\r\n    Far, far you leave your sex behind,\r\n      With you none can compare;\r\n    For who but you, from street to street,\r\n    Would run about a vote to get,\r\n      Thrice, thrice bewitching fair!\r\n    Each day you visit every shop,\r\n    Into each house your head you pop,\r\n      Nor do you act the prude;\r\n    For ev’ry man salutes your Grace,\r\n    Some kiss your hand, and some your face,\r\n      And some are rather rude.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE PARADOX OF THE TIMES.\r\n\r\n    “See modest Duchesses, no longer nice\r\n    In Virtue’s honour, haunt the sinks of Vice;\r\n    In Freedom’s cause, the guilty bribe convey,\r\n    And perjur’d wretches piously betray:\r\n    Seduced by Devon, and the Paphian crew,\r\n    What cannot Venus and the Graces do?--\r\n    Devon, not Fox, obtains the glorious prize,\r\n    Not public merit, but resistless eyes.”\r\n\r\nAs an antidote to the bitterness there was, however, a surfeit of\r\n“sweets:”--\r\n\r\n\r\n“A NEW SONG, TO THE TUNE OF ‘LET THE TOAST PASS.’\r\n\r\n    “To Fox and to Freedom we give our support,\r\n      Every Englishman feels it his duty,\r\n    When their cause is attack’d by the pow’r of the Court,\r\n      And defended by Virtue and Beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe turn of affairs which placed Fox in a majority over Sir Cecil\r\nWray, who for some time was in advance of the Whig chief, is summed up\r\nby Rowlandson, amongst other caricaturists, as “The Case is altered”\r\n(April 29, 1784). The election had nearly another three weeks to\r\nrun, but already the satirists were forecasting the result. Fox, be\r\nit remembered, had other resources in reserve, and, at the close\r\nof the poll, when Wray demanded a scrutiny, and the high bailiff\r\nillegally declined to make his return, he was seated for Kirkwall.\r\nIn the caricaturist’s version, the election has already settled\r\nWray’s chances, and Fox is magnanimously driving off his defeated\r\nopponent, and late dependent, to Lincoln: the ministerial candidate\r\nis travelling, “without drums or trumpets,” smuggled away from the\r\nexciting platform of the hustings, in the “Lincolnshire caravan for\r\npaupers;” he is buried in self-contemplation,--“I always was a poor\r\ndog, but now I am worse than ever.” The generous Fox, charioteering\r\nhis renegade _protégé_, is volunteering, “I will drive you to Lincoln,\r\nwhere you may superintend the _small beer_ and _brickdust_.” Lord\r\nHood’s majority was safe at the head of the poll,--for no reason which\r\nhistory has made manifest; he is pictured as suddenly surprising the\r\ndegrading pauper-conveyance, and, in compassion for his late colleague,\r\nis exclaiming, much moved at these reverses, “Alas, poor Wray!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    EVERY MAN HAS HIS HOBBY-HORSE--FOX AND THE DUCHESS OF\r\n    DEVONSHIRE. #/ ]\r\n\r\nThe doings of the Duchess of Devonshire, her sister, Lady Duncannon,\r\nand their fair following of female canvassers are pictorially treated\r\nby the caricaturist in his version of “The Procession to the Hustings\r\nafter a Successful Canvass,” in which a select group of outlying\r\nvoters, secured after much exertion, are seen conducted in triumph,\r\nand with “rough music,” to the polling-place. The circumstance that,\r\nchiefly owing to the opportune assistance of the Duchess, Fox was\r\nplaced second on the poll was commemorated in “Every Man has his\r\nHobby-horse.” Fox may truly be said to have been carried into the House\r\nof Commons by his fair coadjutor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROCESSION TO THE HUSTINGS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL\r\nCANVASS.

A classic car was prepared, an improvement on\r\nthe perilous glory of being hoisted on the shoulders of excited\r\nchairmen, or, worse still, lifted on those of volunteers--intoxicated\r\nalike with enthusiasm and drinking toasts. The Whig chief mounted\r\nhis triumphal chariot; a multitudinous procession following, closed\r\nby the state-carriages of the Duchesses of Portland and Devonshire,\r\ndrawn by six horses each. Fox descended from the car at Devonshire\r\nHouse, where was erected a temporary scaffolding, on which was raised\r\na bevy of notabilities, including the Prince of Wales, with the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Devonshire, to whose exertions Fox owed a debt of\r\ngratitude. A commemorative dinner was given at Willis’s Rooms, where\r\nFox made a glowing speech on the subject of the election. The Prince\r\nof Wales, after attending the king at a review at Ascot, rode up St.\r\nJames’s Street in his uniform, and was received with acclamations, in\r\nacknowledgment of his partisanship for the Whig chief, whose favours\r\nhe wore,--and ended his day of triumph by dining at Devonshire House,\r\nwhere he appeared wearing Fox’s colours (the Washington uniform), and\r\nwith a laurel branch in token of victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Cecil Wray.\r\n\r\nSam House.\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTMINSTER DESERTER DRUMMED OUT OF THE REGIMENT.

The exultation of those gay\r\ntimes forms a strange contrast to the grim monotony of our own. Fox,\r\nafter being chaired in great pomp through the streets, was finally\r\ncarried into the court-yard of Carlton House. The Prince’s plume was\r\non his banners in acknowledgment of princely partisanship. A banner,\r\ninscribed ‘Sacred to Female Patriotism,’ recorded the services of the\r\nDuchess. The carriages of the Dukes of Devonshire and Portland, each\r\ndrawn by six horses, moved in procession, and Fox’s own carriage was\r\na pile of rejoicing Whiggism. On its boxes and traces, and where they\r\ncould, sat Colonel North, afterwards Lord Guilford; Adam, who but a\r\nfew years before wounded the patriot in a duel; and a whole cluster\r\nof political friends, followers, and expectants. The prince came to\r\nthe balustrade before the house[64] to cheer him, with a crowd of\r\nfashionable people. Fox finished the triumph by an harangue to the mob,\r\nand they in return finished by a riot, an illumination, and breaking\r\nLord Temple’s windows.\r\n\r\n“But the festivities were scarcely begun. The prince threw open his\r\nshowy apartments to the nobility, and gave them a brilliant _fête_\r\nin the gardens, which happened to be at its height just when the\r\nking was passing through St. James’s Park in state to open the new\r\nparliament. The rival interests were within a brick wall of each other,\r\nand their spirit could not have been more strangely contrasted than in\r\ntheir occupations. But nights and days to those graceful pursuers of\r\npleasure and politics alike knew no intermission. On that very evening\r\nthe celebrated beautiful and witty Mrs. Crewe gave a brilliant rout,\r\nin which ‘blue and buff’ were the universal costume of both sexes;\r\nthe buff and blue were the uniform of Washington and his troops, and\r\nimprudently adopted by Fox to declare his hostility to the Government.\r\nThe prince himself appeared in the party colours. At supper, he toasted\r\nthe fair giver of the feast in the words ‘True Blue and Mrs. Crewe.’\r\nThe lady, not unskilfully, and with measureless applause, returned it\r\nby another, ‘True Blue and all of you.’”\r\n\r\nWith the enforced termination of the polling at the fortieth day,\r\narrived the demand of Wray for a scrutiny, and the high bailiff’s\r\nunjustifiable attitude, for which he subsequently suffered severely,\r\nof declining to make a return, compelled Fox to look elsewhere for a\r\nseat, or find no place in the coming parliament, where, as Walpole\r\nsaid, could Fox have stood for every seat in the kingdom he would\r\nhave represented the entire return in his own person, such was his\r\ninfluence and popularity. “The Departure,” (May 18, 1784), the day\r\nsucceeding the close of the poll, shows Fox leaving behind him the\r\npalatial abode of his warm supporter, the Prince of Wales, and taking\r\nleave of his delectable champions, the Duchess of Devonshire and\r\nher sister, the fair Lady Duncannon, _en route_ for “Coventry” or\r\n“Out-in-the-cold-shire.” Fox is observing on his retreat:--\r\n\r\n    “If that a scrutiny at last takes place,\r\n    I can’t tell how ’twill be, and please your Grace!”\r\n\r\nFox’s early ally, Burke, equipped as an outrider, is prepared to drive\r\nhis friend away from the scene of his triumphs; under Edmund’s arm\r\nis a “plan of economy,” suggestive of necessary retrenchments in the\r\nWhig camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEFEAT OF THE HIGH AND MIGHTY BALISSIMO CORBETTINO AND\r\nHIS FAMED CECILIAN FORCES, ON THE PLAINS OF ST. MARTIN, ON THURSDAY,\r\nTHE 3RD DAY OF FEBRUARY, 1785, BY THE CHAMPION OF THE PEOPLE AND HIS\r\nCHOSEN BAND.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 287._]\r\n\r\nAmong the tactics of the Ministerialists may be reckoned the ominous\r\n“scrutiny,” which was threatened directly Fox’s votes began to\r\noutnumber those in favour of his rival, Wray. On Fox’s success this\r\nintention was carried out, the returning officer acting partially\r\nin order to connive at the manœuvre; a scrutiny being notoriously\r\na tedious, lengthy, and costly affair, and hence more vexations to\r\nFox than to the combined forces of his opponents. This circumstance\r\nis illustrated by the caricaturist, nearly a twelvemonth later;\r\nwhen the excitement of the protracted contest had cooled down, Fox\r\nsecured another victory over his adversaries, which is commemorated in\r\nRowlandson’s version of the affair (March 7, 1785), entitled:--\r\n\r\n    “Defeat of the high and mighty Balissimo Corbettino and\r\n    his famed Cecilian forces, on the plains of St. Martin, on\r\n    Thursday, the 3rd day of February, 1785, by the Champion of\r\n    the People and his chosen band, after a smart skirmish, which\r\n    lasted a considerable time, in which many men were lost on both\r\n    sides. But their great ally at length losing ground, desertions\r\n    took place, and notwithstanding their vast superiority in\r\n    numbers and weight of metal at the first onset, this increased\r\n    apace, altho’ often rallied by the ablest man in command, till\r\n    at length the forces gave way in all quarters, and they were\r\n    totally overthrown. This print is dedicated to the Electors of\r\n    the City and Liberty of Westminster, who have so nobly stood\r\n    forth and supported their champion upon this trying occasion,\r\n    by AN INDEPENDENT ELECTOR.”\r\n\r\nRowlandson has pictured the rival combatants at the head of their\r\nlearned forces. Fox’s lawyers are triumphant, and armed with such legal\r\nweapons as “Eloquence,” “Truth,” “Perseverance,” and “Law;” the Whig\r\nchief, in person, is dealing vengeance upon the disconcerted figures\r\nof his antagonists, Wray and Corbett. Fox had successfully prosecuted\r\nhis action and recovered heavy damages against the bailiff, who, as\r\na courtier, had made himself the tool of the Ministerialists. Fox\r\nis defended by his buckler, “Majority 38;” he is wielding the keen\r\nsword of “Justice;” a laurel crown is placed on the chieftain’s brow\r\nby a celestial messenger, who is charged with the decision of the\r\nLaw Court--“It is ordered that Thomas Corbett, Esq., do immediately\r\nreturn.” Fox is declaring:--\r\n\r\n    “The wrath of my indignation is kindled, and I will pursue them\r\n    with a mighty hand and outstretched arm until justice is done\r\n    to those who have so nobly supported me.”\r\n\r\nSir Cecil Wray’s defence of “Ingratitude” is a sorry shield for the\r\nprotection of himself or of his fallen ally; his sword is broken; in\r\ndespair he cries, “My knees wax feeble, and I sink beneath the weight\r\nof my own apostasy.” The high bailiff is cast down; he confesses,\r\n“My conscience is now at peace.” Another supporter of the returning\r\nofficer is exclaiming, “Help, help! our chief is fallen. O conscience,\r\nsupport me!” Corbett’s lawyers have turned their abashed backs on their\r\nclient and his cause: “Nor law, nor conscience, nor the aid of potent\r\nMinisters, can e’er support the contest ’gainst such a chief!” “Our\r\nsupport is gone, and we are fallen into a Pitt; yea, even into a deep\r\nPitt!”--the premier having been unable to protect the guilty against\r\nthe consequences of their act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL MEETINGS, 1788 TO 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen Admiral Lord Hood’s energetic canvass at the great\r\nWestminster election, when, with the powerful assistance of the Court,\r\nhe fought the Whigs, but failed to hinder Fox’s election. In spite\r\nof the victory gained in 1784 by their opponents, four years later\r\nthe ministerialists and the “king’s friends” were again forced into\r\na fresh contest on the same field, and more ignominiously defeated;\r\nthe popular Lord Hood, their chosen champion, having in July, 1788,\r\nbeen appointed to a seat at the Admiralty Board, as a recognition of\r\nhis services to Government, a fresh election was necessary for the\r\ncity of Westminster. The Whigs were still to the front, and Lord John\r\nTownshend came forward and canvassed in that interest, with such strong\r\nsupport from the Opposition that the ministers now experienced a more\r\ninglorious reverse, their candidate being unseated, although recourse\r\nwas had to every expedient, lawful or otherwise, that could promote\r\nthe return of Hood, the Government nominee. After the close of the\r\npoll, which showed Lord John Townshend with 6392 votes, to Lord Hood’s\r\n5569, thus giving two Whig members for Westminster, Gillray exposed the\r\ncorrupt practices of the Court agents in the caricature, published on\r\nAugust 14, 1788, entitled, “Election Troops Bringing in their Accounts\r\nto the Pay-Table.” The premier is seen behind the bars of the Treasury\r\ngates; the undisguised and direct applications of his quondam allies\r\nare so compromising that it is inexpedient to admit the claimants, or\r\nacknowledge an acquaintance with such disreputable connections; but\r\na saving compromise is suggested. Pitt is made to plausibly protest,\r\n“I know nothing of you, my friends. Lord Hood pays all the expenses\r\nhimself;” then, in a whisper, “Hush! go to the back-door in Great\r\nGeorge Street, under the Rose.” Sir George Rose was Pitt’s secretary\r\nand _factotum_; he is chiefly seen in the contemporary satires as\r\nassociated with what was called “back-stairs influence,” of which he\r\nmay be accepted as chamberlain; his scene of operations was generally\r\nrepresented as the “back-door of the Treasury,” where he diplomatically\r\ncarried out the stratagems of the premier--especially, as in the\r\npresent instance--in the indirect recognition of secret services.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTION TROOPS BRINGING THEIR ACCOUNTS TO THE PAY\r\nTABLE, WESTMINSTER. 1788.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES GILLRAY.]\r\n\r\nForemost in the rank of election troops is the modish Major Topham,\r\na conspicuous personage in his day, who frequently appears in the\r\ncaricatures of the time; his notoriety was due to the _World_,\r\na society newspaper of the last century, of which the major was\r\nproprietor, editor, and fashionable gossip-monger. Topham has brought\r\na copy of his organ to prove the active support he had lent the\r\nGovernment during the Westminster contest, and is the first to present\r\nhis bill “for puffs and squibs, and for abusing the Opposition.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDEPENDENT ELECTOR.]\r\n\r\nA ragged newsboy from the _Star_ has also brought his journal and a\r\nclaim for payment “for changing sides, for hiring ballad-singers, and\r\nGrub Street writers.” As usual, some scenes of a desperate character\r\nhad marked the election, and three downright bullies, giant troopers\r\nof the Guards, with ensanguined bayonets as evidence of their late\r\nemployment, demand pay “for the attack in Bow Street;” a publican\r\nbrings in a reckoning “for eating and drinking for jackass boys;”\r\nballad-singers have come to claim “five shillings a day” for their\r\nprofessional services; a cobbler, with Hood’s cockade, presents a\r\nmodest bill “for voting three times” as “an independent elector;”\r\na clothesman of the Hebrew persuasion is clamouring for money “for\r\nperjury, and procuring Jew voters;” and a body of Hood’s sailors,\r\narmed with formidable cudgels, are come for payment “for kicking\r\nup a row,”--as in the election of 1784, Hood’s boisterous sailors\r\nwere brought up to the hustings to support their admiral, and were\r\nparticularly violent and reckless in their zeal for the cause,\r\nintimidating those voters who were recognized as favouring the opposite\r\nparty, and forcibly keeping them away from the polling booth. These\r\njolly Jack Tars, with perfect singleness of mind, and oblivious of nice\r\ndistinctions which they did not understand, were filled to overflowing\r\nwith explosive loyalty for the king, and fealty for their admiral;\r\nbut on this occasion the sailors were beaten by the Irish chairmen\r\nwith hearty goodwill, and, with their patron, Lord Hood, experienced a\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, it is consolatory to find that the gallant Lord Hood was\r\nagain returned for Westminster; Fox heading the poll with 3516 votes;\r\nHood, as a good second, with 3217: on this occasion the Whigs lost a\r\nseat, for John Horne Tooke, although so prominent a figure, failed to\r\nrepeat the success of Lord John Townshend, 1679 votes were polled for\r\nthe “Parson of Brentford,” otherwise John Horne Tooke, the celebrated\r\nphilologist.\r\n\r\nCurious anomalies were witnessed under the old boroughmongering system,\r\nanterior to the sweeping measure of reform. Helston, in Cornwall,\r\nwas a typical case. The elective franchise was formerly invested in\r\nthe corporation, which consisted of the mayor, who was the returning\r\nofficer, eleven aldermen, and twenty-five common council-men,\r\nthirty-six in all. The old charter of Elizabeth was confirmed by\r\nCharles I., and, according to common report, there survived but one\r\nelector under this charter in 1790, to whose lot accordingly fell\r\nthe unusual distinction of nominating two representatives on his own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe family interest of the Osbornes (Duke of Leeds) proved so paramount\r\nas to here prevent any hope of successfully contesting against their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that a certain grace was lent to the\r\ngenerally discordant elements of electioneering by the zealous\r\nparticipation of Beauty in the canvassing department, where the\r\nseductive wiles of female charms and persuasions were relied upon, it\r\nis understood, with reason.\r\n\r\n                              “----a faithful few\r\n    Worth more than all a Sultan’s retinue.\r\n    They point the path, the missing phrase supply,\r\n    Oft prompt a name, and hint with hand or eye,\r\n    Back each bold pledge, the fervid speech admire,\r\n    And still add fuel to their leader’s fire.”\r\n\r\n  (J. STIRLING, _The Election_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROOF OF THE REFINED FEELINGS OF AN AMIABLE CHARACTER,\r\nLATELY A CANDIDATE FOR A CERTAIN ANCIENT CITY. BY JAMES GILLRAY.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 293._]\r\n\r\nThe assistance of the fair sex was much relied upon for soliciting and\r\nsecuring votes; but at such turbulent times, when licence predominated,\r\nthe electioneering Circes must have been prepared for brusque exchanges\r\nof pleasantry, though hardly for such encounters as the one preserved\r\nin Gillray’s “Proof of the Refined Feelings of an Amiable Character,\r\nlately a Candidate for a Certain Ancient City.”\r\n\r\nSome obscurity surrounds the incident represented; obviously the\r\ncaricature was destined for electioneering purposes, but the positive\r\nhistory cannot he traced. It is assumed that the three circumstances of\r\nthe candidate being “an eccentric,” a sportsman, and a representative\r\nof a cathedral city point to Sir Charles Turner (created a baronet by\r\nthe Marquis of Rockingham in 1782), who represented York from 1768 to\r\n1783. This gentleman always dressed as a sportsman, wearing a green\r\ncoat, “tally-ho” buttons, with top-boots, etc., upon all occasions;\r\nhe was described by Coombe (_Royal Register_) as the “Marplot” of his\r\nown party, “and in his parliamentary capacity demands the pity of his\r\nfriends, the contempt of the wise, and makes himself a laughing stock\r\nfor the crowd.” On the discussion of Pitt’s motion for parliamentary\r\nreform, May 7, 1782, Sir Charles Turner by his blunt originality\r\nattracted more attention than either the mover or seconder; he\r\ndeclared--\r\n\r\n    “that in his opinion the House of Commons might be justly\r\n    considered as a parcel of thieves, who, having stolen an\r\n    estate, were apprehensive of allowing any person to see their\r\n    title deeds, from the fear of again losing it by such an\r\n    inspection.”\r\n\r\nThe personage depicted by Gillray is flourishing his whip “Pro bono\r\nPatriæ,” and forcibly demonstrating his aversion to rival canvassers\r\nof the gentle sex, much to the consternation of the ecclesiastical\r\nhierarchy and gownsmen, while the rough townsmen are cheering their\r\neccentric candidate, and promising to support him.\r\n\r\nIt is to Gillray that we owe the version embodying the glorification\r\nof autocratic boroughmongering as “The Pacific Entrance of Earl Wolf\r\ninto Blackhaven,” January, 1792. Before Lord Grey’s Reform Bill altered\r\nthe constituencies, in the sordid old days of corrupt influence,\r\nwhen the representative system of electing parliaments was purely\r\ntheoretical, a certain number of territorial magnates apportioned about\r\nhalf the constituencies between them; of this, the “upper order,” or\r\naristocratic patrons, trafficked in the seats in exchange for “honours”\r\nfor themselves, or lent their boroughs to support ministerial influence\r\nin return for places and pensions, or offices--sinecures for choice--in\r\nwhich to provide for their less opulent relations; thus in the old\r\nlists of place-holders, pensioners, and “ministerial patronage” may be\r\ntraced the younger sons and cousins in several degrees, besides the\r\nnames of those who have by marriage entered the families of the prime\r\nholders of “marketable ware,” otherwise parliamentary interest. When\r\nboroughmongering was a profession--a very highly paid one--and boroughs\r\nwere farmed for sale, it might be expected that a less elevated\r\nclass of adventurers would treat the question of buying and selling\r\n“seats” in parliament like any ordinary item of commerce, as was the\r\nfact; the markets fluctuated, thus we find Lord Chesterfield, whose\r\nauthority is unquestionable, looking round for some venal borough to\r\nbring in that young hopeful to whom he addressed the famous “Letters,”\r\nthinking it a finishing part of a gentleman’s training to be in the\r\nHouse; the ex-ambassador communicated with an agent, proposing to\r\npay “twenty-four hundred pounds for a seat,” presumably the price in\r\nChesterfield’s younger days; but he found seats had risen to inordinate\r\nrates--up to five thousand pounds--owing to imported competition,\r\nchiefly rich factors returned home with fortunes from the East and West\r\nIndies. Bubb Dodington has set down in his “Diary” how he, the lordly\r\nproprietor of this said “marketable ware,” went about bargaining to\r\nbring in ministerial nominees for his five or six seats in exchange\r\nfor places at the disposal of the administration; and instances might\r\nbe multiplied to a tedious extent from the journals of the House\r\ncontaining the evidence of trafficking in boroughs and buying up\r\nvoters, _en gros et en détail_, as disclosed on controverted elections.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs produced a mechanical majority as long as the\r\nprime minister in power could command wealth and influence sufficient\r\nto secure a larger number of seats than the opposition. It was in\r\nthis direction that the famous electioneering genius, the Marquis of\r\nWharton, spent a hundred thousand pounds in William III. and Queen\r\nAnne’s days; while Walpole manipulated such huge sums, thinly disguised\r\nas “Secret Service Money,” that, never wealthy enough to purchase all,\r\nand meeting occasional honest members, he was, at intervals, impeached\r\nfor corruption in a House two-thirds venal, as it is alleged.\r\n\r\nWalpole’s successors, who finally drove him from office, bought\r\nelections on even a more extended scale; the Pelhams were clever\r\ndissemblers and apt negotiators for this commodity; it was written of\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, by his antagonist, Lord Hervey, it is believed:--\r\n\r\n    “And since his estate at Elections he’ll spend,\r\n    And beggar himself without making a friend;\r\n    So while the extravagant fool has a sous,\r\n    As his brains I can’t fear, so his fortune I’ll use.”\r\n\r\nMajor Cartwright, the advocate of universal suffrage, who had the\r\nmisfortune to live a trifle before the times were ripe enough for\r\nreform to be carried, addressed a petition to parliament in 1820,\r\nshowing “that 97 Lords usurped 200 seats in the Commons House in\r\nviolation of our Laws and Liberties;” while 90 wealthy commoners “for\r\n102 vile sinks of corruption (pocket boroughs) brought in the House 137\r\nmembers;” Ministerial patronage returning another twenty, thus giving,\r\naccording to the petitioner’s statistics, “a total of 353 members\r\ncorruptly or tyrannically imposed on the Commons in gross violation\r\nof the law, and to the palpable subversion of the constitution.” At\r\nthat time the Earl of Lonsdale commanded eight seats, as did the\r\nEarl of Darlington. William Pitt, as already described, was seated in\r\nParliament, 1781, by Lonsdale, then Sir James Lowther, who had been\r\nstigmatized by “Junius” as “The contemptuous tyrant of the North,”\r\nand who himself declared that he was in possession of the land, the\r\nfire, and the water of Whitehaven. When the youthful Pitt became\r\npremier, one of his first acts was to acknowledge his obligations to\r\n“the Wolf,” and Lowther was raised to the peerage as Earl Lonsdale.\r\nThe “pacific entrance” of this plutocrat shows the docile “free and\r\nindependent voters” of Whitehaven, driven by Lonsdale’s law agent,\r\nand lashed with thongs of “sham suits at law,” dragging the earl\r\nthrough the tumble-down streets of his town, every window being\r\nilluminated with candles in his honour. He exclaims, “Dear gentlemen,\r\nthis is too much; now you really distress me!” Mobs of his miners are\r\ncheering vociferously, he having brought the townsmen to submission\r\nby suspending the working of his coal-mines. Fair canvassers, with\r\ncomplimentary inscriptions on their banners, head the triumphal\r\nprocession:--\r\n\r\n    “The Blues are bound in adamantine chains\r\n    But freedom round each ‘Yellow’ mansion reigns!”\r\n\r\nBefore the parliamentary dissolution of 1796, the country was in an\r\nagitated state, for distress was prevalent among the poorer classes,\r\nthe expenses of the continental wars were impoverishing the country,\r\nand there was a general outcry for peace; bread riots were common at\r\nthe time, and the price of provisions in general was exceptionally\r\nhigh; political agitators were taking advantage of these circumstances\r\nto fulminate against the king and his ministers; while the various\r\nsocieties, called “seditious” by the Tories in office, received\r\nencouragement from the Whig party, whose prospects of succeeding to\r\npower were not encouraging. A meeting of an enthusiastic nature,\r\nlargely attended, had been held in St. George’s Fields, the scene of\r\nthe former riots, to petition for annual parliaments, and for universal\r\nsuffrage, theories which at that time were regarded hopefully, and\r\nwhich would, it was anticipated, redress existing grievances. In the\r\nautumn of 1795, meetings were held at Copenhagen Fields, where an\r\nimmense multitude assembled to sign addresses and remonstrances on the\r\nstate of the nation. The immediate consequences of the inflammatory\r\norations pronounced to the people on this occasion was that, on the\r\nopening of the final session of the parliament which had assembled in\r\n1790, the king, on his way to the Peers to open the House in state, was\r\nassailed by vociferous cries of “Give us peace and bread!” “No war!”\r\n“No king!” “Down with him! down with George!” Before the House of Peers\r\nwas reached, an attack was made on the royal carriage, stones were\r\nthrown, and one passed through the window. The riot on this occasion\r\nwas made the pretext for the ministry to bring forward new bills for\r\nthe defence of the king’s person, and to attempt further infringements\r\non the liberty of the subject by interfering with the right of public\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACIFIC ENTRANCE OF EARL WOLF (LORD LONSDALE) INTO\r\nBLACKHAVEN. 1792. BY JAMES GILLRAY.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 296._\r\n\r\n    “E’en by the elements his power confessed,\r\n      Of mines and boroughs Lonsdale stands possessed;\r\n    And one sad servitude alike denotes\r\n      The slaves that labour and the slave that votes.”\r\n\r\n  (_Rolliad._)]\r\n\r\nThe political clubs renewed their clamours for a more extended system\r\nof representation freed from corruption, and protested against Pitt’s\r\nnew enactments; the London Corresponding Society called another public\r\nmeeting, at which the premier is said to have shown symptoms of alarm.\r\nGillray’s engraving of a meeting of “Patriotic Citizens at Copenhagen\r\nHouse,” November 16, 1795, satirizes the order of agitators and their\r\ndisciples as the dregs of the people, which he represents them to be.\r\nThis demonstration, which was largely attended, was held to protest\r\nagainst the “Seditions Bill” for the protection of the king’s person,\r\nfor which, it was argued, ample provisions were already legalized.\r\nPetitions to both Houses were prepared, and remonstrances numerously\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nThis situation is embodied in the picture of the assembly. The orator,\r\nThelwall, is holding forth to an audience which is more picturesque\r\nthan distinguished. Platforms are arranged at intervals as rostrums\r\nfor the speakers, at one of which a butcher is enlarging on “The\r\nRights of Citizens.” The proprietress of a halfpenny gaming-table has\r\nlabelled it, “Equality and no Sedition Bill.” An emissary of Thelwall’s\r\nis offering the remonstrance to sweep-boys for signature; and the\r\nautographs attached thereto, though notorious, are hardly such as to\r\ncommand the respect of parliament--“Jack Cade, Wat Tyler, Jack Straw,\r\netc.”\r\n\r\nAfter the elections of 1784 parliament was entirely in the control of\r\nPitt. It met, wrote Horace Walpole, “as quietly as a Quarter Session,”\r\nthe opposition seemed quelled, or driven to despair.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at Copenhagen House failed to accomplish its purpose,\r\nand further protests were entered against the Seditions Bill “for\r\nthe better protection of the king’s person,” which was carried in\r\nthe House by large majorities; this repressive measure provided that\r\nno gathering exceeding fifty persons should take place, even in a\r\nprivate house, without previous information had been laid before a\r\nmagistrate, who might attend, and, if he saw cause, order the meeting\r\nto disperse, while those who resisted would be guilty of felony. In\r\nthe face of such unconstitutional interference, fresh hostility sprang\r\nup throughout the land; and there being anticipations of an appeal\r\nto the country, the opposition endeavoured to present a bold front\r\nbefore the constituencies in view of that event; one of these meetings\r\nwas summoned by the Sheriff of Middlesex, inviting the freeholders to\r\nassemble at the Mermaid, Hackney; this gathering has been commemorated\r\nby Gillray. The object of the meeting was to obtain a repeal of the\r\nobnoxious Seditions Bill, which, as the artist shows, the Whig member,\r\nGeorge Byng, is vigorously denouncing from the platform; it was at\r\nthe same time proposed to prepare an “Address to the King,” and Mr.\r\nMainwaring, the ministerial representative, is, with Jesuitical\r\nexpression, deprecating hostility both to the Government and to their\r\noppressive legislation, Fox is holding the hat of his oratorical\r\ndisciple, Byng. It was on this occasion that the sturdy Duke of\r\nNorfolk, who raised the royal ire by proposing as a toast in a public\r\nassembly, “The Majesty of the People,” took occasion to warn those who\r\nvalued the liberty of the subject that they must not be misled by the\r\nspecious titles of the bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEETING OF PATRIOTIC CITIZENS AT COPENHAGEN HOUSE,\r\n1795.

The progress of our relations\r\nwith France, and many unpopular and stringent measures, like the\r\nSeditions Bill, had revived antagonism, and every fresh legislation\r\nwhich encroached on the rights of the people weakened the Government\r\ninfluence. Pitt, anticipating the struggle, boldly resorted to his old\r\npolicy, and the intention of dissolving parliament was announced in the\r\nspeech from the throne. Gillray, whose admirable caricatures illustrate\r\nthe leading political events from 1782 to 1810, has epitomized the\r\nsituation as “The Dissolution, or the Alchymist Procuring an Ætherial\r\nRepresentation,” May 21, 1796. Pitt is seated on the model of his new\r\nbarracks; the transmutation is carried out from the premier’s recipe,\r\n“Antidotus Republica;” Treasury coals, _i.e._ golden pieces, feed\r\nthe furnace; the breeze is raised by the Crown as a bellows; the old\r\nHouse of Commons, seen in the alembic, shows a few tenants, such as\r\nFox and Sheridan, left on the opposition benches, but all is rapidly\r\ndissolving into a new chamber, where the alchemist is enthroned as\r\n“Perpetual Dictator,” “Magna Charta” and “Parliamentary Rights” become\r\nhis foot-stools, and adulation of the most slavish order is offered up\r\nby the members of the newly constituted and subservient Commons.\r\n\r\nMaidstone, for which Benjamin D’Israeli took his seat in 1837, has\r\nbeen the scene of many severe and exceptionally costly contests.\r\nAt the general election, 1796, the defeated candidate, Christopher\r\nHull, is reported to have polled the greatest number of single votes\r\never tendered for that constituency, he having expended three thousand\r\npounds in about seven hours. This heavy outlay proved fruitless, as Mr.\r\nHull stood last on the list; but attempting to make a merit of this\r\nliberal use of money, the reputation of which he hoped might serve\r\nfor a future occasion, the incipient “electioneerer” was assured by\r\nhis friends “he must start on fresh grounds, as the present would be\r\nconsidered as nothing more than electioneering experience.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISSOLUTION; OR, THE ALCHYMIST PRODUCING AN ÆTHERIAL\r\nREPRESENTATION.

The celebrated philologist, John Horne Tooke,\r\nendeavoured to gain the second seat, as the colleague of the great\r\nWhig chief. On this occasion “the Brentford parson” secured, though\r\nunsuccessful, a larger number of votes; Fox was returned at the\r\nhead of the poll, and Sir A. Gardner was second. Gillray has left a\r\ncharacteristic likeness of the Whig chief, very “spick and span,”\r\ndeferentially bowing from “The Hustings,” in acknowledgment of the\r\nribald, if popular, reception his admirers are according their old\r\n“true blue” member for Westminster. Fox is pressing to his heart, in\r\nparody of another measure, the “Pewter Pot Bill.” “Ever guardian of\r\nyour most sacred rights, I have opposed the Pewter Pot Bill.” His\r\naudience is filled with enthusiasm. As an allusion to Fox’s supposed\r\nsympathies with events then proceeding in France--the pot-boy of “The\r\nTree of Liberty,” Petty France, is offering a foaming measure to the\r\nwell-tried patriot and popular representative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE KNIFE-GRINDER.]\r\n\r\nThe well-known “Friend of Humanity and the Knife-Grinder,” one of\r\nthe most spirited poetical squibs, which first appeared in the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, was reprinted as a broadside for electioneering\r\npurposes, with a no less spirited plate, by Gillray, as a heading; and\r\ndedicated “To the Independent Electors of the Borough of Southwark,”\r\nof which constituency Tierney--whose person was figured as “the Friend\r\nof Humanity”--was the representative in parliament. Canning’s admirable\r\nparody was founded upon Southey’s poem, “The Widow,” and written in\r\nEnglish sapphics, in imitation of the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n“FRIEND OF HUMANITY.\r\n\r\n    “Needy knife-grinder! whither are you going?\r\n    Rough is the road; your wheel is out of order--\r\n    Bleak blows the blast--your hat has got a hole in’t,\r\n                                So have your breeches!\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Weary knife-grinder! little think the proud ones,\r\n    Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike\r\n    Road, what hard work ’tis crying all day, ‘Knives\r\n                                And scissors to grind, O!’\r\n\r\n    “Tell me, knife-grinder, how you came to grind knives?\r\n    Did some rich man tyrannically use you?\r\n    Was it the squire? or parson of the parish?\r\n                                Or the Attorney?\r\n\r\n    “Was it the squire for killing his game? or\r\n    Covetous parson for his tithes distraining?\r\n    Or roguish lawyer made you lose your little\r\n                                All in a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n    “(Have you not read the ‘Rights of Man,’ by Tom Paine?)\r\n    Drops of compassion tremble on my eye-lids,\r\n    Ready to fall, as soon as you have told your\r\n                                Pitiful story.\r\n\r\n\r\n“KNIFE-GRINDER.\r\n\r\n    “Story!

Although the system of\r\nrepresentation was notoriously corrupt, at least half the seats being\r\nin the patronage of interested persons, it was thirty-four years before\r\nEarl Grey’s measure for reform could be carried, and then only under\r\nextraordinary circumstances. After Grey’s earlier defeat, it was felt\r\nthat in a House of Commons completely submissive to the ministerial\r\ndictates, and which resisted amendment, the opposition leaders could\r\nmake no impression, and they accordingly announced their intention for\r\nthe present of taking no further part in its proceedings; the voice of\r\nFox was scarcely heard in the House till the century closed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after the secession of the Whig party from the debates,\r\nthe agitation throughout the country increased, political societies\r\nbecame more active, and frequent meetings were held to discuss the\r\nnecessity for parliamentary reform. One of the most remarkable of these\r\nwas held under the auspices of Bertie Greathead, the owner of “Guy’s\r\nCliff,” near Warwick; a medal commemorative of this gathering and\r\nits object, reform, was struck for the occasion. These medals were a\r\npopular method of spreading political opinions. The patriotic reform\r\nmedal was parodied by another of a loyal nature, representing the devil\r\nsuspending three halters over the heads of the demagogues, who are\r\nmounted in “a condemned cart;” on the one side are shown the applauding\r\n“wrong-heads,” while a large assembly of “right-heads” express their\r\ncontempt for the proceedings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wilkes.\r\n\r\nAbbé Siéyès.\r\n\r\nHorne Tooke.\r\n\r\nC.

BY JAMES GILLRAY.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 305._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOYAL MEDAL. 1797.\r\n\r\nA parody of the patriotic medal struck in commemoration of the Reform\r\nmeeting held at Greathead’s, Guy’s Cliff, Warwick.]\r\n\r\nThe Tories exulted over the secession of “the party,” and numerous\r\ncaricatures appeared, imputing all sorts of offences to the Whigs; and\r\none version represented Fox as “Phaeton” involving the Whig Club in\r\nhis destruction. We have noticed the candidature of Horne Tooke for\r\nWestminster; ever since his prominence upon the occasion of Wilkes’s\r\nreturn for Middlesex in 1768, the “Brentford Parson” had striven to\r\nobtain a seat in parliament. He was in 1798 one of the most conspicuous\r\nmembers of the reform associations. Few were his match in ready\r\neloquence, his pen was ever active, and his writings to the purpose.\r\nAt an earlier stage of his career, a pamphlet appeared, written, it\r\nwas alleged, by his hand, contrasting the two Pitts with the two Foxes\r\nas a pair of portraits; the comparison being in favour of the former.\r\nAdvantage was taken of this circumstance to bring into discredit the\r\nconfederation of Horne Tooke (who held more democratic views) with Fox\r\nfor the advancement of the reform cause. James Gillray designed for\r\nthe _Anti-Jacobin Review_ his own satirical version of “Two Pair of\r\nPortraits, presented to all the unbiased Electors of Great Britain,\r\nby John Horne Tooke,” December 1, 1798. The eminent philologer is\r\nrepresented as a portrait-painter, seated before his easel, on which\r\nappear the two original likenesses of the Whig and Tory chiefs, Pitt\r\nresting on the pedestal of “Truth,” and Fox on that of “Deceit.” The\r\npresentment of Lord Holland with the plunder of “unaccounted millions”\r\nso frequently quoted, is placed beside the portrait of the patriotic\r\nEarl of Chatham, dowered with the “Rewards of a Grateful Nation.”\r\nHorne Tooke, who has in his pocket, “Sketches of Patriotic Views, a\r\npension, a mouth-stopper, a place,” is presumed to be retouching his\r\nunflattering and sinister portrait of the Whig chief, while demanding\r\nof the electors of Great Britain, which two of them will you\r\nchoose to hang in your Cabinets, the PITTS or the FOXES? “Where,\r\non your conscience, should the other two be hanged?” Allusions\r\nto various periods of the limner’s life and principles appear round the\r\nstudio--the windmill at Wimbledon (where Tooke resided), the parsonage\r\nat Brentford, the bust of Machiavel, the shadow or “silhouette” of the\r\nAbbé Siéyès; the picture of his old friend Wilkes, in his aldermanic\r\ngown as the prosperous and handsomely remunerated city chamberlain,\r\n_ci-devant_ Wilkes and Liberty; “The effect in this picture to be\r\ncopied as exact as possible;” “A London Corresponding Society, _i.e._ a\r\nSketch for an English Directory;” with a folio of “Studies from French\r\nmasters, Robespierre, Tallien, Marat,” together with the prospectus for\r\na new work, “The Art of Political Painting, extracted from the works of\r\nthe most celebrated Jacobin professors.”\r\n\r\nThe Shakespeare Tavern, celebrated as the head-quarters of the Whig\r\nparty during Fox’s candidature for Westminster, was the scene of a\r\npopular ovation on the twentieth anniversary of the Whig chief’s\r\nelection for that important constituency; the event was celebrated by\r\na public dinner, October 10, 1800. Fox had so long absented himself\r\nfrom Parliament, feeling, as he declared, “his time of action was over\r\nwhen those principles were extinguished on which he acted,” that his\r\nreappearance excited the greatest enthusiasm amongst his partisans,\r\nwho were anxious both to hear his sentiments on the political outlook,\r\nand to demonstrate their unabated attachment to the “Man of the\r\nPeople,” who preferred to seclude himself from public business and\r\nfrom the platform of his most brilliant oratorical triumphs, that he\r\n“might steadily adhere to those principles which had guided his past\r\nconduct.” Every room in the house was filled with company. In replying\r\nto the cordial reception of his health, Fox reminded his auditors that\r\n“During the twenty years I have represented you in Parliament I have\r\nadhered to the principles on which the Revolution of 1688 was founded,\r\nand what have been known as the old Whig principles of England;” and\r\nrecalled that his first connection with his constituents occurred\r\n“during the calamitous war with America;” he then alluded to his\r\nabsence from Parliament, extended to three years, and thus eloquently\r\nconcluded: “I shall ever maintain that the basis of all parties is\r\njustice--that the basis of all constitutions is the sovereignty of\r\nthe people--that from the people alone kings, parliaments, judges,\r\nand magistrates derive their authority.” Gillray has embodied this\r\nsituation in his pictorial version of this most enthusiastic reception,\r\nungenerously representing Fox as “The Worn-out Patriot; or, the Last\r\nDying Speech of the Westminster Representative,” October 10, 1800.\r\nThe great statesman is depicted as both mentally and physically in a\r\nstate of decadence; Erskine is sustaining him with a bottle of brandy\r\nto stimulate his strength artificially, while Harvey Combe, in his\r\nrobes as Lord Mayor, is lending his substantial support; a measure of\r\nWhitbread’s “entire” is also ready for the emergency. Among the guests\r\nare figured Sir J. Sinclair, and the gifted member for Southwark,\r\nTierney. The speech the satirist has sarcastically introduced is a\r\nparody on that delivered by the Whig chief to the electors on the\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, you see I am grown quite an old man in your\r\n    service. Twenty years I’ve served you, and always upon the\r\n    same principles. I rejoiced at the success of our enemies in\r\n    the American War, and the war against the virtuous French\r\n    has always met with my most determined opposition; but the\r\n    infamous Ministry will not make peace with our enemies, and are\r\n    determined to keep me out of their councils and out of place.\r\n    Therefore, gentlemen, as their principles are quite different\r\n    from mine, and as I am now too old to form myself according\r\n    to their systems, my attendance in Parliament is useless, and,\r\n    to say the truth, I feel that my season of action is past, and\r\n    I must leave to younger men to act, for, alas! my failings and\r\n    weaknesses will not let me now recognize what is for the best.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE WORN-OUT PATRIOT, OR THE LAST DYING SPEECH OF THE WESTMINSTER\r\nREPRESENTATIVE, ON THE ANNIVERSARY MEETING, HELD AT THE SHAKESPEARE\r\nTAVERN, OCTOBER 10, 1800. BY JAMES GILLRAY. ]\r\n\r\nPointed and pungent as is this version, it is on record that Fox’s\r\nmental activity was still most brilliant; indeed, to the extent of\r\nconverting his consistent enemy, George III. The supposed “Worn-out\r\nPatriot” lived to form an administration in 1806 in conjunction with\r\nLord Grenville, who made Fox’s accession to power a _sine quâ non_. He\r\nfilled the office of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at perhaps\r\nthe most delicate and critical period of our history, when Napoleon\r\nentertained designs against England; and on the death of the patriotic\r\nstatesman, the king declared “he had never known the duties of that\r\noffice so efficiently discharged for the honour of the country.”\r\n\r\n    “Who,” remarked a contemporary, “in reviewing Fox’s noble\r\n    adherence to the cause of Liberty, as it affected the American\r\n    nation, and weighing the wisdom of his forewarnings of the\r\n    fatal consequences of the American War, but must admire the\r\n    prophetic spirit with which he foretold all the direful events\r\n    which resulted both to the Mother Country and her colonies from\r\n    that unnatural fratricidal war.”\r\n\r\nThe first Parliament after the Union with Ireland met January 22,\r\n1801, and was marked by the reappearance of Fox and the election of\r\nHorne Tooke for the borough of Old Sarum through the influence of Lord\r\nCamelford. The return of one who had been in holy orders involved a\r\ngreat constitutional question; his admission was opposed on the ground\r\nof his clerical profession, and it led to a bill making clergymen\r\nincapable of sitting in parliament. Tooke occupied his seat until the\r\nnext dissolution, which occurred the year following, when he was no\r\nlonger eligible. The circumstances are commemorated in a caricature\r\nby Gillray, entitled, “Political Amusements for Young Gentlemen, or\r\nthe Brentford Shuttlecock between Old Sarum and the Temple of St.\r\nStephen’s,” March, 1801. Lord Temple led the opposition to Tooke’s\r\nadmission, and he is represented as resisting his entrance to the\r\nHouse, within which Fox is pictured crying, “The Church for Ever!” Lord\r\nCamelford, who was in the navy, is batting the shuttlecock from Old\r\nSarum (the electors depicted as swine at a trough) to the Commons; he\r\ncries, “There’s a stroke for you, messmate; and if you kick him back,\r\nI’ll return him again, if I should be sent on a cruise to Moorfields\r\nfor it! Go it, Coz.” Lord Temple is replying, “Send him back? Yes, I’ll\r\nsend him back twenty thousand times, before such a high-flying Jacobin\r\nshuttlecock shall perch it here in his Clerical band.” Lord Camelford’s\r\n“List of Candidates” includes, besides Tooke, the names of Black Dick\r\n(his negro servant), and orator Thelwall, in case his ex-clerical\r\nnominee’s election was annulled; but his lordship disclaimed ever\r\nhaving entertained the intention of offering so gross an insult to the\r\nHouse. The inscriptions on the feathers stuck in the head of the noble\r\nlord’s plaything, “The Old Brentford Shuttlecock,” are intended to\r\nindicate his character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Temple.\r\n\r\nJ.

Upon Mr. Jefferys accepting this invitation, and\r\nproceeding down to Coventry to meet his constituents, his entrance\r\ninto the city was unhandsomely opposed, a riot ensued, and things\r\nbegan to look dangerous, when Captain Barlow of the First Dragoon\r\nGuards, who happened to be there, his regiment being stationed in the\r\nneighbourhood, exerted himself with much spirit to quell the riot and\r\nprotect the candidate and his friends from insult. Rarely has a casual\r\nand unexpected service been more singularly acknowledged; Captain\r\nBarlow was at once invited to join Mr. Jefferys as second Conservative\r\ncandidate, which he readily accepted; the show of hands at the hustings\r\nwas in his favour, and both were triumphantly returned. The contest was\r\na close one; Captain Barlow stood at the head of the poll with 1197\r\nvotes, N. Jefferys was elected with 1190; and the two Whig candidates\r\nwere defeated--Wilberforce Bird with 1182, and Peter Moore with 1152\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThe Middlesex election of 1804 vividly recalled the previous excitement\r\nmanifested at the Brentford hustings on the return of John Wilkes;\r\nthe new party of “root-and-branch reformers,” more extreme in their\r\npolitical views than the Foxites, were now becoming most conspicuous\r\nby their agitations for the revision of the Constitution, and began\r\nto be known under the designation of Radicals. At the head of these\r\n“patriots” in the House of Commons were several of the younger\r\npoliticians and “new luminaries,” such as Whitbread, Lord Folkestone,\r\nand others; but the most prominent leader of the movement was Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, then occupying the position previously held by “Wilkes\r\nand Liberty” at the commencement of the reign, and by Fox before his\r\nsecession from Parliament. Horne Tooke, who passed out-of-doors as\r\nthe baronet’s political sponsor, “guide, philosopher, and friend,”\r\nwas actively supporting his pupil, and William Cobbett was, by his\r\nenergetic writings, proselytizing in the same cause, and was generally\r\nregarded as the apostle of the latest sect. In the same ranks were\r\nincluded the wealthy Bosville and other zealous partisans. At the\r\nMiddlesex election of 1802, Sir Francis Burdett, in the Radical\r\ninterest, had unseated the Tory candidate, W. Mainwaring, polling\r\nnearly double the votes obtained by the ministerial candidate, who had\r\nrepresented the county from 1784.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, the election for Middlesex was equally trying for the\r\nadministration as the memorable struggle at Westminster in 1784, and\r\nrecalled the scenes witnessed on the same spot in 1786. Gillray has\r\ncommemorated this occurrence in one of his most elaborate caricatures,\r\npublished August 7, 1804:--“Middlesex Election, 1804--a Long Pull, a\r\nStrong Pull, and a Pull All Together;” the hustings at Brentford appear\r\nin the distance, whereon the ministerial candidate is holding forth\r\nto an exuberant crowd, amidst which derisive symbols are displayed--a\r\nhuge begging-box, a gallows with an effigy suspended, and a banner\r\ninscribed, “No Begging Candidate.” The head-quarters of the Court\r\nparty, at the sign of the Constitution (a crown and mitre) placarded\r\nwith posters, “Mainwaring, King, and Country,” and advertising “good\r\nentertainment,” is treated to a perfect shower of missiles and dirt; a\r\nfree fight is proceeding at a distance. Beneath the standard claiming\r\n“Independence and Free Elections,” now a reasonable aspiration, but,\r\nin those days, regarded as little short of sedition, a rat is hung to\r\na lantern, expressive of contempt for “ministerial rats.” Sir Francis\r\nBurdett is carried triumphantly to the hustings; his barouche, drawn by\r\nthe most illustrious members of the opposition, is emblazoned on the\r\npanels with suggestive devices: “Peace” is figured as a French eagle,\r\nwith the legend, “_Égalité_;” the Torch of Liberty is a flaming and\r\nincendiary brand; and “Plenty” is symbolized by a pot of porter with\r\nthe head of Bonaparte on the measure. Beneath the wheels of Burdett’s\r\nchariot is figured a dog with “A Cur-tis” on his collar, a blow at\r\nSir William Curtis, enriched by “fat” Government contracts; by him is\r\nTooke’s tract, “A Squeeze for Contractors.” On the box is the baronet’s\r\nreputed preceptor, the Brentford Parson himself, “in his habit as he\r\nlived,” smoking his pipe like his confederate “Bellenden,” that\r\n“revolution sinner” Dr. Parr; from the prime agitator’s pockets fall\r\nthe speeches, “hints,” and addresses it is implied he had prepared for\r\nhis hopeful pupil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDDLESEX ELECTION, 1804. A LONG PULL--A STRONG\r\nPULL--AND A PULL ALL TOGETHER. BY JAMES GILLRAY.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 312._]\r\n\r\n“The Party” is doing its utmost to forward Burdett’s career, and to\r\nmortify the Ministry. Tyrwhitt Jones and General Fitzpatrick, eccentric\r\nand independent politicians, are leading the “marrow-bone and cleaver”\r\nmusic; two lines of influential Whig statesmen are propelling the car;\r\nBosville, Grey, the Duke of Northumberland, the Marquis of Lansdowne,\r\nand the Duke of Norfolk in one file, and Lord Carlisle, the Duke of\r\nBedford, Lord Derby, and Fox in the other, all travestied felicitously\r\nunder disguises which the caricaturist has suggested as appropriate\r\nto their characters or situations. Lord Moira (Marquis of Hastings),\r\nwith the prince’s plume on his instrument, is acting as drummer.\r\nBehind the carriage rides Erskine in his bar robes, with the cap of\r\nliberty on a pike, marked “The Good Old Cause.” Tierney has “The Key\r\nof the Bastille,” in allusion to Burdett’s exertions on behalf of the\r\npolitical prisoners with which the prisons, such as Coldbath Fields,\r\nwere at that time filled; while Sheridan is raising aloft the pictorial\r\nversion of the “Governor in All His Glory,” _i.e._ Pitt flogging\r\nBritannia, who is fixed in the pillory, of which an enlarged version\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA FLOGGED BY PITT--THE GOVERNOR IN ALL HIS\r\nGLORY. 1804.]\r\n\r\nThe election contests in 1806 and 1807, which ensued on the death of\r\nFox, fully occupied the pencil of Gillray: his elaborate cartoons, of\r\nwhich reduced _fac-similes_ are given, prove that election squibs must\r\nin his day have enjoyed a large circulation; the artist seems to have\r\ndeveloped them into elaborate conceptions. Westminster was again the\r\nconstituency, where the struggle was regarded as of most absorbing\r\ninterest. Sheridan, who had sat for Stafford from 1780, now flattered\r\nhimself that his popularity and his intimacy with Fox would, on the\r\ndecease of the Whig chief, point him out as the natural successor of\r\nthe illustrious statesman. He found an embarrassing opponent in James\r\nPaull (the son of a prosperous tailor), who had returned from India,\r\nwhere he filled an appointment, and brought home with him a moderate\r\nfortune and liberal ideas as regarded administrative reform. His\r\ncandidature for Westminster was supported by the influence of all the\r\nadvanced politicians, the ultra-Liberals, and the Radical Reformers.\r\n\r\nIn the first of Gillray’s satires on this topic, the “Triumphal\r\nProcession of Little Paull, the Tailor, upon his new Goose,” November\r\n8, 1806, Sir Francis Burdett, who was for some time travestied as “The\r\nFamous Green Goose,” is lending Little Paull a helping mount; Tooke\r\nis leading his pupil; Colonel Bosville is distributing money to make\r\nthe candidate popular; Cobbett, with “Political Register” in hand, is\r\ncanvassing for Paull and “Independence and Public Justice”--referring\r\nto the new patriot’s articles of impeachment against the Marquis of\r\nWellesley on his return from India. In view of the energetic tactics of\r\nthe new candidate and his allies, Sir Samuel Hood and Sheridan thought\r\nit advisable to combine their interests, and make a coalition for the\r\noccasion. The situation is pictorially summed up as “The High-flying\r\nCandidate, Little Paull Goose, mounting from a Blanket--_Vide_ Humours\r\nof Westminster Election” (November 11, 1806). Paull, according to\r\nthe ungenerous practice of all concerned, was taunted with being the\r\nson of a tailor. Sir Samuel Hood, with one arm lost in his country’s\r\nservice, and Sheridan in sables for his late friend, and with the farce\r\nof “The Devil Among the Tailors” in his pocket, are together raising\r\ntheir high-flying antagonist in the “Coalition Blanket.” The Admiral’s\r\nsailors and patriotic volunteers for Sheridan are alike pronouncing\r\nemphatically for the combined names of the two senior candidates. At\r\nthe feet of the Coalition members is the memorial slab to departed\r\ngreatness, “Sacred to the Memory of Poor Charley, late member for\r\nthe City of Westminster,” “We ne’er shall look upon his like again;”\r\nthe monument is thrust aside by the outraged spirit of the deceased\r\npatriot, who is in anguish exclaiming, “_O tempora! O mores!_”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Granville.\r\n\r\nMellish.\r\n\r\n  Marquis of Buckingham.\r\n  Lord Temple.\r\n\r\nHead of Fox.\r\n\r\nByng.\r\n\r\nWm.

BY J.\r\nGILLRAY.]\r\n\r\nGillray’s third caricature on the general election of 1806 exhibits\r\na spirited panorama of the procession to the hustings as “Posting to\r\nthe Election: a Scene on the Road to Brentford,” in which each of the\r\ncandidates is hastening in the way supposed to best characterize his\r\nprospects and party: William Mellish, who enjoyed the interest of the\r\nCoalition Ministry then in office, is driven in style, in a dashing\r\n“Rule Britannia and the Bank” four-in-hand, under the “Flag of Loyalty\r\nand Independence,” by Lord Granville as coachman; Lords Temple and\r\nCastlereagh, and the Marquis of Buckingham are perched behind; the\r\nlatter is giving a sly helping pull to the post-chaise and pair in\r\nwhich is seated George Byng--“in the good old Whig interest;” the head\r\nof Fox is displayed on the box as “the good old Whig Block.” Prominent\r\nin the foreground is the grand _melée_ of the Coalition candidates\r\nfor Westminster--Sheridan and Sir Samuel Hood, mounted on a prancing\r\nbrewer’s horse, just escaped from the dray, with panniers overflowing\r\nwith gold pieces, and labelled, “Subscription Malt and Hops from the\r\nWhitbread Brewery.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COALITION CANDIDATES--SHERIDAN AND SIR SAMUEL HOOD.\r\n1806.]\r\n\r\nBurdett’s ballad-singers and marrow-bone-and-cleaver men are scattered\r\nby the plunging dray-horse from Whitbread’s, and the startled donkey,\r\nwhich bears little Paull, is giving the rider an upset, in which\r\nPaull’s famous “Impeachment of the Marquis of Wellesley” is falling\r\nto the ground. Last comes Sir Francis Burdett, who, on this occasion,\r\nexperienced a mortifying defeat in the face of his former triumphs\r\nat Brentford; the gay barouche of 1800 and 1804 has given place to\r\nan “untaxed cart” with four miserable jackasses; the efforts of a\r\nposse of sweeper-boy followers with difficulty extricate this shabby\r\nconveyance from the slough. Acting as postillion is the little\r\nCorsican, Bonaparte, then but recently elected Emperor of the French.\r\nIt was at this time one of the theories of Napoleon I., that, after\r\nthe visionary conquest of England, he would inaugurate a republic,\r\nfor the presidency of which he declared Sir Francis Burdett to be, in\r\nhis estimation, the fittest person in England; this opinion, it is\r\nbelieved, was shared by the baronet--an entertaining aspect of the\r\n“might-have-beens”! “Liberty and Equality, No Placemen in Parliament,\r\nand No Bastilles,” are the watchwords of the party in the condemned\r\ncart; all the members wear “Liberty” favours in their hats. Burdett has\r\n“The Life of Oliver Cromwell” for consultation ready at hand; behind\r\nhim is his political preceptor, Horne Tooke, shown in parsonic guise,\r\nand Bosville with the “Rights of Man” next his heart. Cobbett appears\r\nas the “Radical Drummer,” beating up recruits for Burdett and Paull,\r\nwith his “Political Register” and “Inflammatory Letters.” “Orator\r\nBroad-face, of Swallow Street,” whose mob pleasantries overpowered the\r\nveteran Sheridan at Covent Garden, is among the baronet’s enthusiastic\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RADICAL DRUMMER. 1806.

Burdett.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF THE HUSTINGS IN COVENT GARDEN--WESTMINSTER ELECTION. 1806. BY\r\nJ. GILLRAY.]\r\n\r\nIt was at the Westminster election of 1806 that the excitement\r\nculminated. This long and expensive contest was fruitful in incidents.\r\nGillray has produced the most characteristic “View of the Hustings in\r\nCovent Garden.” At the time this version appeared, Paull was at the\r\nhead of the poll; he is shown vigorously denouncing his discomfited\r\nantagonist--“Harlequin Sherry” as “the sunk, the lost, the degraded\r\ntreasurer.” Immediately behind Paull is the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nwhose son, Lord Percy, had relinquished Westminster after representing\r\nit in parliament for one session, that immediately following Fox’s\r\ndecease; the Duke has “No Coalition” inscribed on his hat, and a\r\n“Letter to the Vestry of St. Margaret’s” in his hand. Cobbett, Burdett,\r\nand Bosville, wearing favours for Paull, are in the front ranks of his\r\nsupporters. Sheridan, exhorted to “Pay your Debts, Mr. Treasurer,” is\r\nrepresented as filled with consternation; Whitbread is vainly trying\r\nto rally his spirits with his “New Loyal Porter;” Sir Samuel Hood\r\nis seemingly ashamed of his colleague, and is chuckling over his\r\nconfusion. The exchange of personalities between Paull and Sheridan,\r\nwho was assisted by the notorious “Pickle,” his son Tom, exceeded\r\nall that had gone before, and degenerated into “Billingsgate” abuse.\r\nSheridan, with questionable propriety, dwelt more particularly on the\r\ndescent of his opponent from “tailordom,” and was waggish in allusions\r\nto the “ninth part of a man.” Paull complimented Sheridan on “his good\r\ntaste,” and justified it by referring to the manager of Drury Lane as\r\nthe “son of a vagabond,” actors being by Act of Parliament classed in\r\nthat category. Paull was the readier at mob oratory, and Sheridan,\r\n“erst the wit of the Commons,” found the hustings a terrible penance;\r\nhis appearance was the signal for violent uproar, and requests for\r\n“renters’ shares” and sums of money owing, and for which it was alleged\r\nhe was liable. Painfully conscious of his familiar embarrassments,\r\nthis raillery, in the presence of persons of credit and influence\r\nwhose support was growing lukewarm, broke down the spirit of the\r\nveteran champion of this order of encounter. He had trusted to his\r\nwell-seasoned experience in mob demonstrations, to his playful wit, apt\r\njocularities, and sarcasms to convert the mob to good humour, and to\r\ncajole them with his popular persuasions into a friendly disposition;\r\nbut he reckoned without allowing for rivalry. Besides the fluent\r\nPaull, there was one man in the crowd who fairly compelled “Sherry” to\r\nretire abashed; in vain he tried by turns ridicule and denunciation of\r\n“hireling ruffians,” the broad-faced orator in the green coat seemed\r\nstimulated by these counter-attacks. A comedy was then popular in\r\nwhich a dandy was repeatedly quizzed by inquiries, directed to the\r\nvarious portions of his apparel, of “Who suffers?” This artillery\r\nwas constantly played upon Sheridan: “Sherry, I see you’ve got a new\r\ncoat--who suffers?” “Sherry, who suffers for that new hat?” After this\r\nthe disconcerted treasurer avoided the hustings, and his son Tom, whose\r\ncool audacity was proverbial, managed to take his place. Sheridan only\r\ngained the election through his coalition with Hood; but the shafts of\r\nCobbett’s “porcupine quills” and the conflict of the hustings rankled\r\nin his breast. A dissolution shortly followed, and he lost his seat,\r\nwhich, by precipitating his financial difficulties, ingloriously\r\nfinished Sheridan’s career.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the famous Coalition Ministry of “All the Talents”\r\nupon the vexed question of Catholic Emancipation was the cause of\r\na fresh appeal to the country early in 1807, when the followers of\r\nthe late Granville Administration contested the constituencies at a\r\ndisadvantage, confronted with the popular cries of “Church and King”\r\nand “No Popery.” Paull now flattered himself that his chances of being\r\nreturned for Westminster were reviving, but candidates were more\r\nnumerous, and Sir Francis Burdett, who was discouraged by his last\r\nexperience from contesting Middlesex, was appealing to Westminster\r\nhimself. Paull advertised a dinner to be held at the Crown and Anchor,\r\nand as Burdett had promised his support, and had actually gone to the\r\nlength of nominating Paull, he was announced, without authority it\r\nappeared, to take the chair; this was the cause of a rupture between\r\nthe prominent Radical candidates. Two days before the meeting, Burdett\r\nwrote to Paull:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PATRIOTS DECIDING A POINT OF HONOUR; THE DUEL AT WIMBLEDON,\r\n    BETWEEN SIR FRANCIS BURDETT AND JAMES PAULL. WESTMINSTER\r\n    ELECTION. 1807. BY JAMES GILLRAY. #/ ]\r\n\r\n    “I must say, to have my name advertised for such meetings is\r\n    like ‘Such a day is to be seen the great Katterfelto,’ and this\r\n    without any previous consent or application. From any one else\r\n    I should regard it as an insult!”\r\n\r\nAt the dinner, it was explained by Sir Francis’s brother that Burdett\r\nhad given no promise to preside; after the meeting broke up, Paull\r\nwaited on his proposer, and a warm altercation ensued, when a hostile\r\nmeeting was arranged to take place the next morning near Wimbledon.\r\nThis duel is made the subject of a fresh satire by Gillray--“Patriots\r\nDeciding a Point of Honour! or, the Exact Representation of the\r\nCelebrated Rencontre which took place at Combe Wood on May 2nd, 1807,\r\nbetween Little Paull the Tailor and Sir Francis Goose.” On the field of\r\nhonour, Burdett continued to be travestied as the famous “great green\r\ngoose:” his letter to the electors at the Crown and Anchor is, with\r\nother political and personal publications, scattered around as the\r\ncause of the encounter; one pair of pistols is already discharged. At\r\nthe second exchange of shots, which Paull demanded, as Burdett declined\r\nto apologize, both combatants were wounded, as shown in the picture.\r\nSir Francis was highly indignant, according to the satirist’s version:\r\n“What, must I be out! and a Tailor get into Parliament?--You’re a\r\nliar! I never said that I would sit as Chairman on your Shopboard!”\r\nPaull, who is girt with a huge pair of shears sword-wise, responds,\r\n“A liar!--Sir, I’m a Tailor and a Gentleman, and I must have\r\nsatisfaction.” Bellenden Kerr and Cooper, the seconds of the respective\r\ncombatants, are provided with two armfuls of pistols for the emergency,\r\nwhich Sam Rogers described as “ending in a lame affair.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE POLL OF THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION, 1807.

BY JAMES GILLRAY. #/ ]\r\n\r\nThe further results of the contest are shown as the “Poll of the\r\nWestminster Election.” According to Gillray’s figurative version,\r\nBurdett, still as the goose with wounded limb, is pitchforked\r\nto the top, whence he is hissing at the Crown as the “Sun of the\r\nConstitution;” his political tutor, travestied as the Evil One, is\r\nhelping his rise; Lord Cochrane, flourishing a club, marked, “Reform,”\r\nis second; Elliot, the brewer, as “Quassia,” is overset; Sheridan, in\r\nhis old Harlequin suit, is slipping down, never to rise again; and\r\nPaull, with his leg damaged, has come down with a run, he having cut\r\nan insignificant figure in the polling; the members of the dismissed\r\nministry are commemorating Burdett’s triumph with “rough music.” This\r\nversion, which contains a number of portraits, is entitled--\r\n\r\n    “Election Candidates; or, the Republican Goose at the Top of\r\n    the Pol(l)e--the Devil Helping Behind! _vide_ Mr. Paull’s\r\n    Letter, _article_ Horne Tooke. Also an exact representation\r\n    of Sawney M’Cockran (Lord Cochrane) flourishing the Cudgel of\r\n    Naval Reform, lent him by Cobbett, and mounting triumphantly\r\n    over a small Beer Barrel, together with an old Drury Lane\r\n    Harlequin trying in vain to make a spring to the top of the\r\n    pole, and slipping down again; and lastly, poor Little Paull,\r\n    the Tailor done over! wounded by a Goose, and not a leg to\r\n    stand on.” (May 20, 1807.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE HEAD OF THE POLL; OR, THE WIMBLEDON SHOWMAN AND HIS PUPPET.\r\n    1807. TOOKE AND BURDETT. #/ ]\r\n\r\nThe support and assistance afforded by the author of the “Diversions\r\nof Purley” to his pupil are further indicated in a caricature which\r\nrepresented the “Brentford Parson” carrying the candidate at the end\r\nof his _pole_, and, as in the former example, exhibiting Burdett to\r\nthe crowd assembled in Covent Garden, under the title of “The Head of\r\nthe Poll; or, the Wimbledon Showman and his Puppet.” Horne Tooke is\r\nadvertising “The finest puppet in the world, gentlemen; entirely of my\r\nown formation. I have only to say the word, and he’ll do anything.”\r\n\r\nAnother view of a hustings is afforded by the caricaturist. From the\r\nplatform a select few of superannuated statesmen are addressing the\r\nconstituents, in this instance pictured as calves. This version,\r\nwhich is by Gillray, represents a phase of the “Patriotic Petitions\r\non the Convention” (of Cintra); “The Chelmsford Petition,” with\r\nPatriots addressing the Essex Calves--who, it is notified, are “To\r\nbe sold to the highest bidder.” Lord Temple is unfolding the _Essex\r\nPetition_--“Horrid Convention! Ministers firing the Park guns;\r\nArmistice in French lingoes!” Earl St. Vincent is appealing to the\r\nelectors, and declaring that all the misfortunes are due to the want of\r\nhim; the gouty veteran is supported by the Marquis of Buckingham, who\r\nis asserting “It’s all for want of us, Gentlemen Calves!” sentiments\r\nwhich the other occupants of the platform, Windham and Lord Henry\r\nPetty, are applauding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nLord Temple.\r\n\r\nLord H.

His entry to the\r\nsenate cost him between £8000 and £9000, on his own showing.\r\n\r\n    “By long-established custom the single vote of a resident\r\n    elector was rewarded with a donation of two guineas; four were\r\n    paid for a plumper, and the expenses of a freeman’s journey\r\n    from London averaged £10 apiece. The letter of the law was not\r\n    broken, because the money was not paid until the last day on\r\n    which election petitions could be presented.”\r\n\r\nThis early success of Wilberforce was won in opposition to the\r\nparamount influence of Lord Rockingham, and that of the Government,\r\n“always strong at a seaport;” but this contest sinks into\r\ninsignificance beside Wilberforce’s later experiences. It was after\r\nthe philanthropist had already represented the county of Yorkshire for\r\ntwenty-three years that, on the unexpected dissolution in 1807, he\r\nfound himself plunged in the most expensive contest on record, one in\r\nwhich it was alleged half a million of money was squandered, and which\r\nhas been aptly designated the “Austerlitz of Electioneering.”\r\n\r\nWilberforce’s opponents were Lord Milton, backed by the powerful\r\ninfluence of his father, Earl Fitzwilliam, and with the active\r\nco-operation of the Duke of Norfolk; and the Hon. H. Lascelles, in\r\npromoting whose return his father, Lord Harewood, was “ready to spend\r\nhis whole Barbados property.” When the great abolitionist arrived\r\nin York, he found his rivals had already marshalled their forces,\r\nretained all the law-agents, and engaged canvassers, houses of\r\nentertainment, and every species of conveyance in any considerable\r\ntown. As Wilberforce assured his friends on the nomination day, when\r\nnearly every hand was uplifted in his favour, “he would never expose\r\nhimself to the imputation of endeavouring to make a seat in the House\r\nof Commons subservient to the repair of a dilapidated fortune,” a\r\nvast subscription was set on foot to defray the expenses he incurred\r\nin standing, and, within a week, this fund reached £64,455. At the\r\nhustings, the high sheriff declared the majority in favour of Lord\r\nMilton and the Hon. H. Lascelles, whereupon a poll was demanded by\r\nMr. Wilberforce, which commenced at once, and continued for fifteen\r\ndays. The high sheriff presided in court, and the poll was taken at\r\nthirteen booths in York Castle yard. For the first few days Wilberforce\r\nstood so low that his professional adviser stated that “the sooner he\r\nresigned the better.” While the heavy purses had secured every mode of\r\nconveyance, even to “mourning coaches,” Wilberforce’s adherents were,\r\nat their own charges, slowly making their way to the poll.\r\n\r\n    “No carriages are to be procured,” says a letter from Hull,\r\n    “but boats are proceeding up the river heavily laden with\r\n    voters; farmers lend their waggons; even donkeys have the\r\n    honour of carrying voters for Wilberforce, and hundreds are\r\n    proceeding on foot. This is just as it should be. No money can\r\n    convey all the voters, but if their feelings are roused his\r\n    election is secure.”\r\n\r\n“How did you come up?” they asked a countryman who had “plumped” for\r\nWilberforce, and who denied having spent anything on his journey.\r\n“Sure enow I cam all’d way ahint Lord Milton’s carriage.” Vast hosts\r\nof mounted freeholders rode in bodies to York, and, when interrogated,\r\n“For what parties do you come?” the response was, “Wilberforce” to a\r\nman, and these continued to arrive both by day and night. The _York\r\nHerald_ summarizes the excitement of the election:--\r\n\r\n    “Nothing since the days of the revolution has ever presented to\r\n    the world such a scene as this great county for fifteen days\r\n    and nights. Repose or rest have been unknown in it, except it\r\n    was seen in a messenger asleep upon his post-horse, or in his\r\n    carriage. Every day the roads in every direction to and from\r\n    every remote part of the county have been covered with vehicles\r\n    loaded with voters; and barouches, curricles, gigs, flying\r\n    waggons, and military cars with eight horses, crowded sometimes\r\n    with forty voters, have been scouring the country, leaving not\r\n    the slightest chance for the quiet traveller to urge his humble\r\n    journey, or find a chair at an inn to sit down upon.”\r\n\r\nAs Wilberforce’s majority increased, the “Miltonians” and “Lascellites”\r\nfreely resorted to tricky manœuvres included among “election tactics.”\r\nFalsehoods about “coalitions” were circulated; it was asserted there\r\nwas “an unholy alliance” between “Saint and Sinner”--Wilberforce\r\nand Harewood House; that the great slave abolitionist was in league\r\nwith the “Nigger Driver,” otherwise Lord Harewood, the holder of the\r\nBarbados slave property. “Then,” says Wilberforce, “the mob-directing\r\nsystem--twenty bruisers sent for, Firby, Gully, and others.” It was\r\nthe object of Milton’s “bravos” to drown Wilberforce’s refutations\r\nof the “Coalition” charge, and when he addressed the people, the mob\r\ninterrupted his explanation. “Print what you have to say in a handbill,\r\nand let them read it, since they will not hear you,” cried a friend.\r\n“They read indeed!” said Wilberforce. “What, do you suppose that men\r\nwho make such a noise as these fellows can read?” This sally won the\r\nheart of the crowd. To the other false rumours against him was added\r\nthat of his own death; four days before the election closed he was\r\nattacked by an epidemic which disabled him from taking a further\r\npersonal share in the struggle. Wilberforce stood at the head of the\r\npoll with 11,806 votes, Lord Milton was returned with 11,177, and\r\nLascelles was defeated, with 10,989.\r\n\r\n    “Had I not been defrauded of promised votes, I should have had\r\n    20,000,” Wilberforce wrote to Hannah Moore. “However, it is\r\n    unspeakable cause for thankfulness to come out of the battle\r\n    ruined neither in health, character, or fortune.”\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the subscriptions was returned. The motives which\r\ninfluenced Wilberforce to this arduous adventure are such as command\r\nthe sympathies of those who prize constitutional freedom.\r\n\r\n    “It is but too manifest,” he wrote, “that expensive contests\r\n    have a natural tendency to throw great counties and populous\r\n    places into the hands of men of immense wealth; just as it has\r\n    been sometimes found that mankind have sought a refuge from the\r\n    evils of anarchy, by running into the opposite extreme, and\r\n    surrendering their liberties.”\r\n\r\nIn a footnote to a series of satirical epistles, published in 1807, as\r\n“The Groans of the Talents,” in six epistles, purporting to be written\r\nby ex-ministers to their colleagues, we get a curious, if apocryphal,\r\nelectioneering anecdote. The putative author of the epistle in\r\nquestion, the Right Hon. W. Windham, and his correspondent, T. W. Coke,\r\nwere both sufferers from the damaging indiscretion recorded. It is\r\nexplained how these candidates were supposed (incorrectly according to\r\nfacts) to have lost their seats for Norfolk. In the general election,\r\n1806, two ladies of the first respectability drove about the county\r\nto canvass for Col. Hon. J. Wodehouse (Conservative), and as they\r\nwere universally respected, their success was proportionably great.\r\nMessrs. Coke and Windham were much chagrined at this circumstance; at\r\nlength, however, the latter gentleman’s inventive genius devised a plan\r\nby which he hoped to turn it to their own advantage. Having procured\r\ntwo comely nymphs of light reputation, somewhat resembling in age and\r\nappearance the “fair petitioners” they were destined to personate,\r\nhe arrayed them in similar apparel, and, having procured a carriage\r\nwhich formerly belonged to one of these ladies, they canvassed another\r\npart of the county in favour of Messrs. Coke and Windham; the trick,\r\nhowever, was discovered, and so indignant were Col. Wodehouse’s fair\r\nfriends, that they instigated their husbands and friends to petition\r\nparliament against the sheriff’s return. Thus did the means by which\r\nMr. Windham hoped to defeat the Hon. John Wodehouse contribute to\r\nthe discredit of himself and friend. It must be added, it is hardly\r\ncredible the Right Hon. W. Windham would be likely to resort to so\r\ndisreputable an electioneering ruse.\r\n\r\nIn the days when candidates paid their electors’ travelling expenses\r\n(and these ranged high, averaging, for example, from London to Hull,\r\nten pounds apiece for freemen, the recognized tariff), curious\r\nmanœuvres were resorted to by the “other side;” one of these was to\r\nbuy off the persons who had the responsibility of delivering these\r\nexpensive cargoes safe and in good voting order at the end of their\r\nexpedition. Among these anecdotes, it is related that, when those\r\nBerwick freemen who happened to reside in the metropolis--\r\n\r\n    “were going down by sea, the skippers, to whose tender mercy\r\n    they were committed, used to be bribed, and have been known in\r\n    consequence to carry them over to Norway!”\r\n\r\nThis is the forerunner of the Ipswich story, that the Ipswich freemen,\r\nunder precisely similar conditions, have occasionally found themselves\r\nin Holland; while, on the authority of R. Southey, it had also occurred\r\nto electors to find themselves delivered at a port in the Netherlands.\r\nThe notorious Andrew Robinson Bowes, who was famous for being\r\nundeterred by scruples, once stood for Newcastle. A cargo of Newcastle\r\nfreemen were shipped from London for his opponent, and the master was\r\nbribed by Bowes to carry them to Ostend, where they remained till the\r\nelection was over.\r\n\r\nThe majesty of the people is adequately represented from a humoristic\r\nstandpoint by Pugin and Rowlandson, as it might have appeared on its\r\nseptennial returns in the boisterous eighteenth century. In the view of\r\nthe most celebrated polling-place of the kingdom, one of the candidates\r\nhas secured the ears of the adjacent crowd:--\r\n\r\n    “A man, when once he’s safely chose,\r\n    May laugh at all his furious foes,\r\n      Nor think of former evil:\r\n    Yet good has its attendant ill;\r\n    A _seat_ is no bad thing--but still\r\n      A _contest_ is the devil.”\r\n\r\nPossibly the voices will follow; a show of hands is offered with\r\nhearty goodwill; but, put to the test of the poll-book, it would\r\nseem that, for the most part, the audience is voteless. However, the\r\npolling-places may be recognized, like cattle pens, in front of the\r\nhustings, with the attendant officials under the supervision of the\r\nhigh bailiff of Westminster as returning officer. The flags indicate\r\nthe respective parishes of the district, such as St. Margaret’s, St.\r\nJames’s, St. Martin in the Fields, etc. Pugin is responsible for the\r\nliteral exactitude with which the locality is represented; his drawing\r\nmay be accepted as a faithful view of the customary arrangement of\r\nthe Covent Garden hustings at the time of the Westminster elections:\r\nwhile Rowlandson has added the life and zest of the subject from actual\r\nobservation. With the history of the famous contests held on this spot\r\nbefore us, it is noteworthy that the artist has given prominence to\r\none well-known feature, characteristic of Westminster elections for\r\nnearly a century, the nomination of an influential naval officer in\r\nthe Court interest, whose supporters, backed up by a contingent of\r\nloyal jack-tars, produced a due effect on the opposition. Rowlandson\r\nwas quite at home in the scene: he has reproduced the bludgeon-boys,\r\nballad-singers, professional pugilists, marrow-bone-and-cleaver “rough\r\nmusic,” and those vendors of cakes, nuts, fruit, and such small wares\r\nas were in request at such times; these itinerant traders found at\r\nelections a large mart for their commodities, but the business was at\r\nsuch times conducted at some personal risk, the baskets being overset,\r\nthe contents scattered, and the owners roughly handled in the course\r\nof the attacks, counter-charges, and other party-manœuvres which\r\ndiversified the proceedings in the vicinity of the hustings.\r\n\r\nG. Cruikshank supplied a frontispiece to Fairburn’s “Electors of\r\nWestminster,” 1810--a copy of the “Speaker’s Warrant for the Commitment\r\nof Sir Francis Burdett to the Tower,” with a burlesque portrait of that\r\nprivileged functionary, the Speaker, in an enormous wig, surmounted by\r\na miniature hat; the Right Hon. Charles Abbott was further caricatured\r\nby the artist as “The Little Man in the Big Wig”--_vide_ “Fuller’s\r\nEarth reanimated.”\r\n\r\nA burlesque, by George Cruikshank, upon one of the candidates for the\r\nCity appeared in 1812, under the title of “The Election Hunter;” it\r\nconsists of a broadside, commencing:--\r\n\r\n    “I’ve just learned, by the porter who stands at my door,\r\n    That your old friend, Sir Charles, means to offer no more.”\r\n\r\nG. Cruikshank has supplied the pictorial embellishments. Sir Claudius\r\nHunter, the canvassing candidate, is standing in the stirrups of his\r\nfamous charger, “White Surrey,” mounted on the platform, attended by\r\nmasked horsemen, and squired by a dilapidated knight in armour, who\r\nhas evidently seen overmuch service. The candidate is thus addressing\r\nthe civic constituency: “Gentleman, I earnestly solicit your vote and\r\ninterest for me and my horse.” This appeal the electors receive with\r\nderision, “No, no; you may saddle White Surrey for Cheapside if you\r\nlike, but not for the House,” “Off, off,” etc.\r\n\r\nThis electioneering squib was probably preceded by another, also\r\ndesigned by G. Cruikshank (published April 10, 1812). In this version,\r\nentitled, “Saddle White Surrey for Cheapside to-morrow--W. Lon. Mil.\r\nRegt. [West London Militia Regiment], General Orders,” Sir Claudius,\r\nmounted on his steed, is making, like a true knight-errant, a quixotic\r\ncharge upon his constituents, preceded by the woeful man-in-armour,\r\nlike Sancho Panza, on an ass; he is charging the throng with his lance.\r\nA groom behind Sir Claudius is exclaiming, “This is our High-bred\r\nHunter!”\r\n\r\nIn 1812, G. Cruikshank found fresh exercise for his etching-needle on\r\nanother electioneering cartoon--“The Borough Candidates,” published\r\nOctober 1812. Suggestions of Gillray will be identified in this plate,\r\nfor the artist is dealing with Charles Calvert, the brewer, who was\r\nelected for Southwark with H. Thornton, in opposition to W. J. Burdett;\r\nthe new member is seated astride a barrel of his own brewing, the\r\n“stingo” is pouring forth from spigot and vent-peg. The discomfited\r\ncandidates are figured on either side; while the heads of the brewer’s\r\nconstituents appear in front.\r\n\r\nElections happily brought both food and occupation to the caricaturists\r\nand satirists, as it has been shown. Incidents connected with this\r\nsubject evidently caught the popular taste, for we find Cruikshank\r\nmaking the most of the mere title, in association with the etching of a\r\nsomewhat commonplace presentment of a country assembly-room, conveying\r\nno flattering impression of the provincial grace and deportment of the\r\nperiod; this was published in 1813--as “An Election Ball:” the floor is\r\noccupied by knock-kneed dancers doddering through figures, while the\r\nmaster of the ceremonies is shouting his instructions to the leader of\r\nthe band, elevated in an orchestra overhead.\r\n\r\nThe artist evidently found this topic remunerative, for in 1819\r\nhe produced a smaller version of “An Election Ball”--a similar\r\nsubject, with the arrangement of the room reversed; a country\r\ndance is proceeding with “hands across;” the clumsy master of the\r\nceremonies, who is pigeon-toed, stands viewing the scene with evident\r\ngratification. This plate reappeared, with a new publisher’s name, in\r\n1835 (republished by Thomas McLean, Haymarket).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hunt.\r\n\r\nBurdett.\r\n\r\nCartwright.\r\n\r\nSir S. Romilly.\r\n\r\nSir M. Maxwell.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDOM OF ELECTION; OR, HUNT-ING FOR POPULARITY, AND PLUMPERS FOR\r\nMAXWELL. 1818. BY G. AND R. CRUIKSHANK.]\r\n\r\nBoth Robert and George Cruikshank were working away on the popular\r\nside of the Westminster election contest, June 18, 1818. “The Freedom\r\nof Election; or, HUNTING for Popularity, and Plumpers for\r\nMAXWELL,” published June 22, 1818, owes its origin to this\r\ncombination of talent. In the caricature, the candidates and their\r\nmost prominent supporters are mounted on the Covent Garden hustings,\r\nof which a front view is given. Hunt stands hat in hand (he and Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett sport “favours”); the Radical reformer is backed by\r\nhis colours, his flag proclaims “Universal Suffrage and Liberty;”\r\nthe standard is surmounted by a cap of liberty. Hunt is making a\r\ncharacteristically downright appeal to his audience:--\r\n\r\n    “I am a plain Englishman. I approve of the conduct of Sir\r\n    Murray Maxwell in coming forward as he has done. Why should\r\n    you send Sir Samuel Romilly to Parliament? He can find his way\r\n    into the Den of Corruption. You know the hero of the Tower,\r\n    as well as I do--who ran out at the back door when his friends\r\n    were waiting for him at the front. _I_ have hoisted the Cap of\r\n    Liberty!”\r\n\r\nThe followers of the speaker are shouting, “Hunt for ever! no\r\nSovereigns, no Regents, no Churches, no Lawyers! Universal Plunder\r\nfor ever! No Sham Patriots. Hunt and Liberty. Hunt and Revolution.”\r\nSir Francis Burdett comes next, beside the Hon. Douglas Kinnaird and\r\nMajor Cartwright; these candidates are variously received. “Burdett\r\nfor ever!--No Weathercocks. No Coalition. The Spenceans for ever!\r\nNapoleon for ever! Burdett for ever! No Spafields Rioters.” “Kinnaird\r\nfor ever!” “Cartwright for ever! No old woman in Parliament.” Sir\r\nSamuel Romilly is standing beside the poll on which the results of the\r\nfirst day’s votings are recorded. The cries for “Romilly and Justice,”\r\n“Romilly and Reform,” indicate a popular candidate. Sir Murray Maxwell\r\nis a prominent figure, and is represented in the full swing of his\r\neloquence; like Hunt, he is disposed to be a courteous opponent:--\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen,--Mr. Hunt is anxious you should hear me now. I am\r\n    certain you will hear him presently with pleasure. I am certain\r\n    my cause is as popular as his; for I see many pretty girls\r\n    pressing forward to hear me. Of all the days in the year, none\r\n    appear more favourable for a British officer to receive your\r\n    support than the anniversary of Waterloo.”\r\n\r\n“Maxwell and the British Navy! Let every man do his duty!” is\r\nshouted; while hostile voices cry, “No Maxwell--no Captain Flog-’em.”\r\nA notice-board, capped by the crown, sets forth the merits of this\r\ncandidate:--\r\n\r\n    “Who is Sir M. Maxwell? He is a brave, learned, loyal, and\r\n    Constitutional man. He hoists only the colours of his King and\r\n    country--not the red flag. He has engaged to pay his share of\r\n    the Hustings to prevent new levies on the people.”\r\n\r\nSir S. Romilly (W) headed the poll with 5339 votes; Sir Francis Burdett\r\nwas a good second with 5238; Sir Murray Maxwell, the unsuccessful\r\ncandidate, polled 4808: the others were “nowhere”--Hunt, 84; Kinnaird,\r\n65; Cartwright, 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNT, A RADICAL REFORMER.]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit the satirists regarded as fair game for their shafts\r\nof ridicule the new political section which had seceded from the\r\nWhig party as being behind the age; these were the “root-and-branch\r\nreformers,” who, from their electing to call themselves Radical\r\nreformers, obtained the party designation of “Radicals.” The orator\r\nHunt is travestied in this guise.\r\n\r\nThe general turbulence of the times at this precise period is\r\ngraphically pictured in “The Law’s Delay.”\r\n\r\n    “Now greeting, hooting, and abuse,\r\n    To each man’s party prove of use,\r\n    And mud, and stones, and waving hats,\r\n    And broken heads, and putrid cats\r\n    Are offerings made to aid the cause\r\n    Of order, government, and laws.”\r\n\r\n  (_The Election Day._)\r\n\r\nThere appeared in 1819 “A Political Squib on the Westminster Election,\r\nCovent Garden” (March 3), by G. Cruikshank. This etching forms\r\nthe frontispiece to a tract published April 20, 1819, for Bengo,\r\nprint-dealer, Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. The somewhat mystifying\r\ntitle of the election squib is “Patriot Allegory, Anarchical Fable,\r\nand Licentious Parody,” and it purports to be written by Peregrine\r\nCastigator. G. Cruikshank has availed himself of that long-suffering\r\nanimal, the British Lion; in this instance the monarch of the beasts\r\npersonates the successful candidate, the Hon. George Lamb being figured\r\nas the lion. He is exhibited standing under the city gate, beneath a\r\nportcullis, wreathed with laurels; his tail is lashed in anger, while\r\nthe unsuccessful candidates, as an additional ignominy to their defeat,\r\nare travestied as the heads of a hydra trampled beneath their political\r\nvictor. John Cam Hobhouse (W) polled 3,861, and was beaten by G. Lamb\r\n(C) with 4,465 votes. T. T. Wooler, the revolutionary publisher, for\r\nwhom Cruikshank was working in 1815, is personified as the “Black\r\nDwarf,” as his whilom ally ever after represented him; his duck’s-head\r\ncap is made to exclaim, “Cartwright and ’38!!!” the next individual\r\nsays, “Quack! quack! quack!”--an allusion to the small minority of\r\nvotes polled by the Radical candidate at the Westminster election for\r\n1819, vice Romilly deceased, when 8,364 votes were registered, and only\r\n38 of these for Cartwright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAW’S DELAY. READING THE RIOT ACT. 1820. BY G.\r\nCRUIKSHANK.\r\n\r\nShowing the advantage and comfort of waiting the specified time after\r\nreading the Riot Act to a Radical mob; or a British magistrate in the\r\ndischarge of his duty, and the people of England in the discharge of\r\ntheirs! See speeches of the Opposition--_Passim_.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 334._]\r\n\r\nMajor Cartwright, the “Drum-major of Sedition” of the ministerial\r\nsatirists, was one of the Radical reformers who laboured actively for\r\nthe reform of parliamentary abuses. He put up for Westminster in the\r\nRadical interest in 1818 and 1819, but seems to have had no support. In\r\n1820, Major Cartwright addressed a petition to the House of Commons for\r\nthe purpose of disclosing “that ninety-seven Lords usurped two hundred\r\nseats in the Commons-House in violation of our Laws and Liberties.”\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved._ That it is a high infringement upon our Liberties\r\n    and Privileges for Lords of Parliament to concern themselves in\r\n    the Elections of members to serve for the Commons.” (_Journals\r\n    at the commencement of every Session._)\r\n\r\nHow far the measure of reform was needed in the corrupt system of\r\nboroughmongering is clearly demonstrated by Major Cartwright’s--\r\n\r\n    “Lists and Tables of Peers of the Realm who have unlawfully\r\n    concerned themselves in the Election of members to serve for\r\n    the Commons in the Parliament which was then sitting (1820),\r\n    with the Counties and Towns where the unlawful interference of\r\n    Peers has operated, either by nomination or influence, with the\r\n    number of members unlawfully returned.”\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Dukes of Bedford and Rutland respectively returned\r\nfour representatives; the same number was in the nomination of the\r\nEarls of Ailesbury, St. Germans, Mount Edgecumbe, etc., while such\r\npowerful autocrats as the Earl of Lonsdale contrived to return eight\r\nnominees, as did the Earl of Darlington; six members were returned\r\nby the Duke of Norfolk and Earl Fitzwilliam respectively; while the\r\nDukes of Devonshire, Newcastle, and Northumberland, the Marquises\r\nof Buckingham and Hertford, the Earl of Powis, and Baron Carrington\r\neach managed to return five seats. To the calculations given in his\r\ntable, the petitioner added the Treasury patronage, then in the Earl\r\nof Liverpool’s control, giving eleven members; the Admiralty, under\r\nViscount Melville’s patronage, imposing three members, the Ordnance\r\n(Duke of Wellington) one--adding again, according to the calculations\r\ngiven in Oldfield’s “Representative History” (vi. 289),--\r\n\r\n    “There are ninety wealthy Commoners who, for 102 vile sinks of\r\n    corruption over which they tyrannize, further dishonour the\r\n    House by forcing on it 137 members,” thus giving a total of no\r\n    less than 353 members, who, as Cartwright represented to the\r\n    House of Commons in his very remarkable Petition, [the Major\r\n    writes] “to use the words of the royal proclamation of the\r\n    30th July, 1819,” were created such “in gross violation of the\r\n    law, and to the palpable subversion of the constitution, being\r\n    corruptly or tyrannically imposed on the Commons.”\r\n\r\n“The pure and undefiled principles of the Constitution” were inculcated\r\nby Major Cartwright in his “Lectures on the British Constitution,”\r\n“Letters to Lord Mayor Wood,” “Letters to Clarkson on African and\r\nEnglish Freedom,” “Resolutions and Proceedings of the Hampden Club,” “A\r\nBill of Rights and Liberties; or, an Act for restoring the Civil Branch\r\nof the Constitution,” and the companion work, “A Bill of Free and Sure\r\nDefence, for restoring the Military Branch.” The major was brimming\r\nover with zeal, and had almost too good a case; unfortunately for the\r\nenforcement of his reforms, he was too early in the field.\r\n\r\nThe coming elections of 1820 were preceded by several caricatures.\r\nThose by George Cruikshank are the most meritorious, the artist’s\r\nwork for this date being at its best. He was at that time employed by\r\nHumphrey, the print-publisher, of St. James’s Street, as a successor\r\nto James Gillray, an honour the artist regarded with pride to the\r\nclose of his long career. On the 1st of January, John Cam Hobhouse,\r\nwho was then canvassing Westminster, and was this year to be sent to\r\nparliament as the colleague of his friend, Sir Francis Burdett, was\r\nexhibited as “Little Hob in the Well,” under the title of “A Trifling\r\nMistake--Corrected.” The diminutive statesman is exhibited in the\r\nplace of his confinement, a prison-cell; he is gloomily contemplating\r\ntwo pictures on the wall, “St. Stephen’s Chapel _versus_ Newgate.” A\r\npile of manuscripts, blackened by the upsetting of an inkstand, and a\r\nmouse-trap assist the allusions. “The Trifling Mistake” is placarded\r\non the wall in the indiscreet but pertinent utterances of the captive,\r\nwhich, if truly set forth, may account for his incarceration.\r\n\r\n    “What prevents the people from walking down to the House and\r\n    pulling out the members by the ears, locking up their doors,\r\n    and flinging the key into the Thames? Is it any majesty which\r\n    lodges in the members of that assembly? Do we love them? Not\r\n    at all; we have an instinctive horror and disgust at the\r\n    abstract idea of a boroughmonger. Do we respect them? Not in\r\n    the least. Do we regard them as endowed with any superior\r\n    qualities? On the contrary, individually, there is scarcely a\r\n    poorer creature than your mere member of Parliament, though\r\n    in his corporate capacity the earth furnishes not so absolute\r\n    a bully. Their true practical protectors, then--the real\r\n    efficient anti-Reformers--are to be found at the Horse Guards\r\n    and the Knightsbridge Barracks. As long as the House of Commons\r\n    majorities are backed by the regimental muster-roll, so long\r\n    may those who have got the tax-power keep it,--and hang those\r\n    who resist.”\r\n\r\nIn the same month appeared another strong “anti-reform” caricature\r\nfrom the same source--though, as we see by a later work, the artist’s\r\nsympathies were at this time on the side of the reformers, while\r\nRadical publishers of an advanced type were his chief employers,--“The\r\nRoot of King’s Evil--Lay the Axe to it,” January 14, 1820. A learned\r\nprelate, seated in his library, is considerably scared by the\r\napparition of the red spectre, literally a root--possibly implying\r\nthe tree of liberty--planted in “le bonnet rouge,” and wearing the\r\ncap of liberty. On a pike in one hand is the mitred head of a\r\nbishop, in the other is another pike surmounted by a battered crown,\r\nwith the tricolour flag edged with crape, and inscribed “Blood,\r\nReform, and Plunder,” with a list of the “reds” and reformers in\r\njuxtaposition--Watson, Thistlewood, Preston, Hooper, Waddington,\r\nHarrison, Hunt, Pearson, Wood, Waithman, Parkins, etc. In the second\r\ncategory are Cobbett, Carlile, Tom Paine, Burdett, Little Hob, Death,\r\nand the Devil,--no King, etc. The prelate is interrogating the spectral\r\nvisitor: “In the name of Satan, what the Devil are you, and where were\r\nyou hatched?” “In Hell, your worship. I’m a Radical. Give me leave to\r\npresent you a list of my best friends.” “Burn’s Justice” stands open\r\nat “Treason,” and a huge volume of “Etymology” stands exposed at the\r\ndefinition of “Radical”--“_Ex Radix_ is a root, and _Calor_ is heat,\r\nanger, strife; _q.d._--The root of all strife.”\r\n\r\nA comprehensive view of the respective sections of Radicals and\r\nReformers on the dissolution of Parliament, February 29, 1820, is\r\nafforded by one of G. Cruikshank’s most successful caricatures, which\r\nmay be considered, in point of execution, as among the works most\r\nworthy of his reputation; it is entitled, “Coriolanus Addressing\r\nthe Plebs,” February 29, 1820. The scene is the screen in front of\r\nCarlton House Palace, and His Majesty, the magnifico George IV., is\r\nflatteringly travestied as Coriolanus. The “cauliflower” wig and false\r\nwhiskers affected by “the finest gentleman in Europe” detract from\r\nthe consistency of the figure, otherwise attired in classic guise,\r\nand presenting a dignified appearance; for, wonderful to relate,\r\nCruikshank has gone out of his way to compliment the king in more than\r\none respect. The address, a felicitous quotation from Shakespeare, is\r\nantagonistic to the actual sentiments held by the artist at this stage\r\nof his career:--\r\n\r\n    “What would ye have, ye curs, that like not peace nor war?\r\n    The one affrights you, the other makes you proud. He that\r\n    trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares;\r\n    where foxes, geese. Hang ye! trust ye!! With every minute you\r\n    change a mind, and call him noble that was now your hate; him\r\n    vile, that was your garland. What’s the matter, that in the\r\n    several places of the city, you cry against the noble Senate,\r\n    who (under the gods) keep you in awe, which else would feed\r\n    upon one another?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon.

BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 338._]\r\n\r\nBeneath the quotation is a passage from Buffon, eulogizing the\r\nnobility of the figure above, “L’image de l’âme est peinte par la\r\nphysionomie”--“animé d’un feu divin,” and other extravagances, such as\r\n“his majestic presence, and the firm and bold deportment which marks\r\nhis nobility and rank.” In the other “Great George’s” parody, the\r\nvarious sections, from Reformers to Revolutionists and Socialists, are\r\ncarefully kept apart, although the plebeians at the first glance appear\r\nbut a miscellaneous mob.\r\n\r\nFirst comes “Liberty of the Press,” a tricolour standard, topped by\r\nthe “cap of liberty.” At the front stands William Hone, a stalwart\r\nchampion, armed with two formidable clubs, one is styled “Parody,” and\r\nthe other inscribed with the names of the famous satirical tracts, “The\r\nMan in the Moon,” and “The House that Jack Built,” both objectionable\r\nweapons in the eyes of the “Coriolanus” of the picture. Behind his\r\nally and publisher, Hone, is the portrait of the artist himself,\r\nwith a tricoloured portfolio marked “Caricature.” George Cruikshank,\r\nin his later days, when turned to Tory proclivities like one or two\r\nother notabilities in the group, endeavoured to soften the impression\r\nconveyed by this print, and described “your humble servant” as “one\r\nof the moderate reformers,” evidently not relishing the company of\r\nthose among whom, in his early truculent days, he had voluntarily\r\nenrolled himself. Next comes the figure of the champion of the Princess\r\nof Wales, “Sheriff Double Hue,” otherwise Waithman, who is hugging\r\na project for “Hell-wide Measures;” beneath the standard of the\r\n“Examiners” and “Chronicles” stands a figure clad in complete Highland\r\ngarb; this is Douglas Kinnaird, on the alert, and armed with his trusty\r\nclaymore. Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse, jointly grasping a\r\nformidable weapon, are enlisted under the standard of “Parliamentary\r\nReform.” Hobhouse is trampling on the “Trifling Mistake,” a parodied\r\nversion of the speech which procured him more notoriety than was\r\ndesirable: over his head is seen Thelwall as a champion lecturer;\r\nMajor Cartwright, the so-called “Drum-Major of Sedition,” after all\r\nhis struggles in the cause, is but a broken-down leader, supported on\r\na crutch stick with one hand, while raising the redoubtable sword of\r\n“Universal Suffrage” in the other. Prominent in front of the group\r\nenlisted under the ensign of “Revolution and Plunder,” capped with the\r\nDeath’s head, stands Wooler, travestied as the “Black Dwarf,” after the\r\npaper he had then made notorious. Orator Hunt, with pike reversed, is\r\nresting one hand on Cobbett’s shoulder; the latter, a brawny figure,\r\nflourishing two gigantic bones (of contention?); another communist\r\nis skulking away, having let fall Tom Paine’s “Age of Reason.” The\r\npublisher of the “new lights,” Carlile, is resting on a staff capped\r\nwith a thistle; Preston, the bootmaker, a violent Democrat, together\r\nwith Thistlewood and others holding extreme views, are enrolled under\r\na bond of “Blood and Plunder.” The figure to the extreme left, next to\r\nthe screen of Carlton House, is described by Cruikshank as intended for\r\nDr. Watson. Truly the “Plebs” form a muster-roll of all the prominent\r\nRadicals and Revolutionists of a period when secret societies of those\r\nwhose designs were inimical to constitutional order were presumed to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nThe evils which disfigured constituencies in the boroughmongering\r\ndays are pictorially set forth by George Cruikshank, under date April\r\n23, 1820, in a caricature entitled “Freedom and Purity of Election!!!\r\nShowing the Necessity of Reform in the Close Boroughs.” The scene\r\nrefers to the elections in Cornwall; the locality being indicated by\r\na signpost as Tregony and St. Austel. The unhappy villagers, by the\r\nindependent exercise of their suffrages, have displeased their feudal\r\nproprietor, and are being summarily evicted from their houses, with\r\ntheir household belongings, by a truculent steward, with a list of\r\nthe “proscribed” held in his hand. Old and young, women and children,\r\nare alike doomed, because they or their protectors have dared to act\r\nwith independence, and have not voted according to the fiat of the lord\r\nof the manor. Daniel O’Connell appears as the unsuccessful candidate;\r\nhe is viewing this mischief with compassion, and is encouraging those\r\nevicted “not to be cast down, as there are other houses besides his\r\nlordship’s,” and that he--the Liberator--“will not desert them,\r\nalthough they have lost the election.”\r\n\r\nParliament reassembled at the end of April, 1820, and in May, George\r\nCruikshank again favoured the public with another anti-reform cartoon,\r\n“Radical Quacks giving a New Constitution to John Bull!” In this\r\nversion the persons most prominent among the “Plebeians” are alluded\r\nto incidentally. John Bull, the national prototype, is reduced, under\r\nthe new “regimen,” out of all recognition; in fact, he is but the\r\nmangled remnant of his former portly self, for the new charlatans are\r\nhaving “their own sweet will.” John Bull is placed between Burdett\r\nand Hobhouse; many desperate operations have already taken place.\r\nHe wears the bonnet-rouge of “Liberty” as a night-cap. His left arm\r\nis in a tricoloured sling, while his right arm is being bled. His\r\ntwo sufficient supports of Church and State have been amputated, and\r\nin their places are strapped two wooden-legs--“Universal Suffrage,”\r\npropped on the “Rights of Man,” and “Religious Freedom,” which is\r\nraised on the “Age of Reason;” the legs of his invalid-chair are\r\nequally unreliable--“Mistaken Confidence,” and “Mistaken Security;”\r\nthe sufferer is resting on a pillow stuffed with “False Promises” and\r\n“Reformers’ Opinions.” Sir Francis Burdett, as a professional adviser,\r\nis holding the arm from which he is draining the patient’s blood:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Bull, you have lived too well, but when we have renovated\r\n    your constitution according to our plan, the reform will be\r\n    so complete--that you will never again be troubled with any\r\n    fulness whatsoever!”\r\n\r\nJohn Cam Hobhouse is administering a tricoloured bolus of formidable\r\ndimensions, to be followed by a corresponding draught:--\r\n\r\n    “Never mind, Mr. Bull; if we have thought it necessary to\r\n    take off both your legs, you will find the others very\r\n    good substitutes; this Revolutionary Bolus and decoction\r\n    of disloyalty are very harmless, but they will restore the\r\n    _general equality_ of the intestines and remove any obstruction\r\n    which may prevent us from effecting a Radical Reform in the\r\n    system.”\r\n\r\nThe victim of these experiments is by no means assured as to his\r\nfuture--\r\n\r\n    “Maybe, gentlemen,” he replies to these plausible assurances;\r\n    “but you have taken all the honest good blood out of my veins;\r\n    deprived me of my real supporters, and stuck two bad props in\r\n    their place, and if you go on thus, I shall die before ever my\r\n    constitution can be improved.”\r\n\r\nThe real supporters, “Mr. Bull’s two legs--Church and State,” are\r\nconsigned to a coffin, “to be entombed in the vaults of St. Stephen’s\r\nChapel.” A formidable array of nostrums are displayed in the vicinity:\r\nBurdett has soporifics and opiates handy--a huge bottle, labelled\r\n“Burdett’s Mixture,” contains a red, white, and blue republican\r\ndecoction, “Hobhouse’s Newgate-proof Purity,” and “Whitbread’s Entire;”\r\na large packet of “Cartwright’s Universal Grease,” with a phial of\r\n“Wooler’s Black-drops;” “Old Bailey Drops” (the bottle broken); ditto,\r\n“Dr. Watson’s White + Comfort;” a packet of “Hunt’s Powder,” and a full\r\nsupply of “Cobbett’s Hellebore Ratsbane”--enough, in all conscience, to\r\nkill or cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nELECTIONEERING, POLITICAL WARFARE, AND PARLIAMENTARY REFORM UNDER\r\nWILLIAM IV., 1830-32.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last parliament of George IV.’s reign met November 14, 1826.\r\nTowards the close of the session, as is shadowed in Doyle’s early\r\ncartoons, the nation was tiring of the Tories, and the unpopular and\r\nsomewhat antiquated Wellington Ministry found the country in distress\r\nand clamorous for retrenchment, to each of which complaints the rigid\r\ndisciplinarian in chief command turned a deaf and unsympathetic\r\near. Towards the middle of the year 1830 the king’s condition was\r\nthreatening, and with his impending decease the close of the session\r\nwas anticipated. The situation is pictorially summed up in one of HB’s\r\nsketches as the “Present State of Public Feeling Partially Illustrated”\r\n(May 28, 1830). The views entertained by various individuals upon the\r\nking’s illness are illustrated in their persons: a dandy regrets the\r\npostponement of routs and balls, a speculator complains of the dulness\r\nof the funds, a merchant finds business at a standstill, while a lady\r\nof fashion is resigned to the will of Providence by the opportune\r\nreflection that should the king die there would be the gayer prospect\r\nof a queen and Court--an advantageous exchange for a sovereign shrouded\r\nfrom his subjects. John Bull good-naturedly declares he hopes George\r\nmay recover, “he was such a fine princely fellow!” But the part of this\r\npicture which applies most pertinently to the subject in hand is found\r\nin a member of the Tory Government, who is reflecting “That should\r\nthere be a change in the ministry--then I must walk out. That would\r\nbe very inconvenient at the present. I wish most sincerely His Majesty\r\nwon’t die yet!” while another M.P. is filled with apprehension: “There\r\nwill he a dissolution of parliament, and I shall lose my seat, and with\r\nit all chance of preferment. Oh, I pray God to preserve His Majesty’s\r\nlife these many years.” Swiftly indeed, and somewhat unexpectedly too,\r\ncame the end of the king’s reign and the inauguration of a more liberal\r\n_régime_.\r\n\r\nThe next day appeared HB’s version of the “Mourning Journal--Alas! Poor\r\nYorick” (May 29, 1830), showing the Duke of Cumberland and Lord Eldon\r\nas mutes in attendance on the (to them) melancholy occasion of their\r\nchief’s decease. “The Magic Mirror, or a Peep into Futurity” (June\r\n8, 1830), shows a magician favouring John Bull with the prospect he\r\nmight anticipate: the youthful Princess Victoria becoming the point of\r\ncontention on the one hand between her mother, the Duchess of Kent,\r\nand her uncle, Prince Leopold, of Liberal proclivities, and the Tory\r\npressure of her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, assisted by the Duke of\r\nWellington, on the other.\r\n\r\nWhile the dissolution was impending, Doyle indicated the revival of\r\nWhig prospects, “The Gheber worshiping the Rising Sun” (July 6, 1830)\r\nshows Mr. (afterwards Lord) Brougham paying his devotions to “William\r\nIV. Rex,” the head of the king on the gold coin, known as “a coronation\r\nmedal,” rising over the waters, and taking the place of the orb of day.\r\nParliament dissolved on July 24th. Owing to some intrigues of the old\r\ncampaigner at this emergency, the Duke of Wellington was made to appear\r\nas “A Detected Trespasser,” ordered off the slopes of Windsor by “John\r\nBull, Ranger:” “Halloa, you sir; keep off the grass (see anecdote,\r\n_Times_, July 19th).”\r\n\r\nAnother pictorial version of strategies in high life is entitled\r\n“Anticipation; or, Queen Sarah’s visit to Bushy” (July 27, 1830). At\r\nthe door of the Lodge at Bushy, where resided the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Clarence, is the carriage of Lady Jersey, with attendants in her\r\nhandsome liveries. One of her footmen is imparting the unwelcome\r\nintelligence, “Duchess not at home, my lady.” The Duke of Wellington,\r\nwho is on horseback at the other side of the carriage, is consoling\r\nLady Jersey’s disappointment: “Never mind, never mind, I’ll get you\r\na key to what is going on here thro’ my dear little St. James’s\r\nMarchioness.” The duchess’s footman, in the royal livery, cannot fathom\r\nthe intrigue: “I wonder what brings her down here now? I have been in\r\nthis place these twelve years, and never saw her here before!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Brougham.\r\n\r\nKing William IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GHEBER WORSHIPING THE RISING SUN. JULY 6, 1830. BY J. DOYLE (HB).]\r\n\r\nWhat unknown marvels might be anticipated from the combinations of\r\nparty, is hinted in the “_Un_-Holy Alliance, or An Ominous Conjunction”\r\n(July 29, 1830), showing the Duke of Cumberland and Lords Durham,\r\nGrey, and Eldon in close confabulation. “Old Bags,” as the whilom lord\r\nchancellor was irreverently christened, is characteristically “laying\r\ndown the law,” for the enlightenment of his comrades in this strangely\r\nassorted quartette.\r\n\r\nA general and somewhat conventional satire on the possible conduct of\r\ncandidates before, upon, and after their return, appeared among the\r\n“Election Squibs and Crackers for 1830,” “Look on this Picture, and\r\non that.” “General Election--dedicated to Electors in General--the\r\ndifference between one hour after the return, and one month after.”\r\nThe voter represented is evidently a prosperous mechanic; he wears the\r\ncolours of the newly elected one in his hat, and is thus addressed by\r\nthe member he has contributed to return: “My worthy, my best friend,\r\nit will be my constant study to comply with your wishes--how can I\r\nserve you? Let me see you often; pray come to the Hall; we shall be\r\nso happy to see you.” This overcoloured state of things is strangely\r\naltered within a month; the candidate is now a full member, and is\r\nevidently studying his own interests to the exclusion of those of his\r\nconstituents; in his hand is a peremptory Government “whip,” thus\r\nworded: “Ministers wishing to pass the measure, your vote will be\r\nrequired.” The legislation in question appears to threaten the welfare\r\nof his late enthusiastic supporter, who has ventured to interview his\r\nmember on the momentous topic: “Sir, there is a Bill about to pass\r\nthat will quite ruin our trade, and bring our families to beggary. I\r\nhope, sir, you will use your influence to throw it out.” The member\r\nnow wears an indignant expression: “You are an impudent fellow! I\r\ndon’t know you, and, if I did, do you suppose I should be dictated\r\nto, fellow?” This plate was executed by William Heath, and issued by\r\nT. McLean, of the Haymarket. Perhaps the most notable feature is an\r\nannouncement that “Election caricatures can be executed for gentlemen\r\nin three hours.” This advertisement, appended to the caricature in\r\nquestion, is curious. Of course, for a not-extravagant consideration,\r\nintending candidates could secure the playful services of William Heath\r\nfor rendering ridiculous or contemptible the persons and principles of\r\ntheir antagonists, and for the exaltation of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOK ON THIS PICTURE--AND ON THAT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Before the Election.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After the Election.]\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION SQUIBS AND CRACKERS FOR 1830. BY W. HEATH.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 346._]\r\n\r\nPolitical satirists, happily for themselves, as a rule (with one or\r\ntwo exceptions, such as Sayer and HB) have soared above mere party\r\ndistinctions; and though it may at first sight strike the observer\r\nas indicating a looseness of principles--rather, say, a freedom from\r\nprejudices--that each gifted artist seems to lash and laugh at both\r\nsides alternately to the best of his abilities, some allowance must be\r\nmade for the impartiality which enables these latter-day Juvenals to\r\ndetect the foibles of either faction. As a rule, it may be assumed the\r\nold generation of famous caricaturists, taking Gillray, Rowlandson, and\r\nGeorge Cruikshank as the most eminent exponents, rather leaned to the\r\npopular side of any given question; but, inclination apart, they were\r\njust as capable of glorifying “the powers that be,” and of “dusting\r\nthe jackets” of the would-be reformers. Of this trio, Cruikshank\r\nparticularly prided himself, as he has himself recorded, upon espousing\r\nthe side of right against palpable wrong, and of championing the weak\r\nagainst the strong. But, in spite of this pleasing illusion, his\r\ncaricatures are equally trenchant on either side--to-day the Regent is\r\ndemolished, to-morrow his unfortunate wife is held up to opprobrium,\r\nwith happy nonchalance and impartiality. In fact, it may be said of\r\nGillray, as the specimens of his ability in this direction sufficiently\r\ndemonstrate, that his pictorial satires against Pitt and the Tories\r\nwere equalled only by his satires directed against Fox and the Whigs,\r\nor the youthful Burdett and the Radical reformers of his earlier day.\r\n\r\nApropos of the same general elections, we find our old friends,\r\nSir Francis Burdett and his whilom preceptor and champion, William\r\nCobbett, of _Political Register_ repute, engaged in what the artist\r\ndelineates as “A _Character_-istic Dialogue” (September 2, 1830).\r\n“Peter Porcupine,” having parliamentary aspirations, is applying to\r\nhis ancient pupil and ally for a voucher: “Being much in want of a\r\ncharacter, I make bold, Sir Francis, to ask you for one; it appearing\r\nthat your benevolence in this way embraces all sorts of criminals,\r\nyou cannot consistently refuse me!” Burdett, in spite of this touching\r\nreference to his exertions on behalf of the prisoner inmates of\r\nColdbath Fields, is turning a haughty front to the applicant: “I cannot\r\ndo anything for you; your character is already _Registered_.” With the\r\nreformed parliament, Cobbett was returned for Oldham. In the House he\r\ndisappointed expectations, and was regarded as somewhat in the light of\r\na failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM COBBETT--“PETER PORCUPINE.” BY J. GILLRAY.]\r\n\r\nThe usual changes of seats had taken place in the course of the\r\nelections, and it was hinted that the Wellington-Peel Administration\r\nmight find it expedient to increase its strength by the infusion of\r\nnew blood, with a view to the “power-to-add-to-their-numbers” policy.\r\nThe chiefs still in office are shown by Doyle as visiting “The Noodle\r\nBazaar” (September 9, 1830, Q. and HB delt.). Reviewing the files\r\nof various assorted “bustoes,” Wellington, using his eye-glass, is\r\nobserving to his colleague, “Peel, I am in great want of a few good\r\nheads to place in our Cabinet before the opening of the new House\r\nin October, and I see some here which I think would answer, if they\r\ncould be had on reasonable terms.” Peel, alive to the results of the\r\nelections, is replying, “I perceive that the places of some have been\r\nchanged, and their value raised since I last saw them, and pray observe\r\nthe strange mixture of heads upon the _upper shelf_.” The Peers who,\r\naccording to the notification below them, “May be had separately or\r\ntogether,” occupy the upper shelf, and below is a cabinet of busts for\r\nsale, ready assorted. The shelved lords offer a motley choice: Lords\r\nGrey, Eldon, Holland, Lansdowne, the Duke of Cumberland, etc.,--all\r\nstatesmen out of work. Below the upper shelf is a platform on which\r\nis an assorted ready-made ministry (of busts) arranged in a regular\r\norder. “This group is to be sold in one lot. Every head has its price\r\nmarked on it.” The respective busts represent Huskisson (president of\r\nthe Board of Trade), Grant (colonies), Palmerston (foreign secretary),\r\nMelbourne (home secretary), etc. On a pedestal marked “Yorkshire, to\r\nwit,” is the brazen bust of Henry Brougham, the plinth with the word\r\n“Rolls” struck out in favour of “Chancery.” The bust of Hume in marble\r\nstands on a square and massive pediment, marked “Middlesex.” O’Connell\r\nis below in clay; he is thus ticketed: “This head won’t be sold--(until\r\nit be bought).” A row of lesser men on a shelf in the distance bears\r\nthe advertisement, “These small busts may be had remarkably cheap.”\r\nThe bust of Charles X. is just upset; while, on a high plinth, marked\r\n“The People’s Choice--a French pattern of inestimable value,” stands\r\nhis successor, Louis Philippe. The Dey of Algiers is also thrown aside,\r\nwhile Lords Manners, Redesdale, and Sidmouth are among the “antiques,”\r\nobsolete patterns, and “oddments.”\r\n\r\nThe proverbial independence of John Bull’s character is playfully\r\ncalled in question (September 10, 1830), the national prototype being\r\nrepresented (not for the first or last time) as “The man wot is easily\r\nled by the nose.” The _Times_ is the potential leading organ to which\r\nJohn Bull is attached in the way described; he is exclaiming, in\r\nhappy delusion, “What a glorious thing it is to enjoy the liberty and\r\nindependence of an Englishman!”\r\n\r\nThe displacement of the Wellington-Peel Cabinet followed a little\r\nlater on. We next see the Duke of Cumberland surrendering office:\r\n“Resignation and Fortitude; or, the Gold Stick.” The king is seated\r\nbusied in State affairs, the ex-Gold Stick, handing in the wand of\r\noffice, is remarking, “I have now only to cut my stick and be off!”\r\nWilliam IV., still pen in hand, replies briefly, “Thank ye, brother,\r\nthank ye,” being evidently reconciled both to his situation and the\r\nenormous sacrifice involved.\r\n\r\nIncidentally we find a reference to the general election which was then\r\nengaging public attention; Doyle has ingeniously given a novel turn to\r\nhis view of one of the candidates, by introducing a comparison with a\r\nperformer who was also enjoying popular notice, “The Rival Candidates”\r\n(August 9, 1830). There are two hustings erected, and the crowd of free\r\nand independent electors is filling the intervening space. The satire\r\nis evidently aimed at Sir Alexander Grant, who, standing in front of\r\nhis committee, is pointing, with a self-satisfied air, to his chin, of\r\nwhich Doyle has made the most. His rival is Michel Boai, “the musical\r\nwonder,” a Tyrolese performer, who “played tunes on his chin” by sheer\r\nmuscular force. He is shown hammering his nether jaw with his fists,\r\nand giving a specimen of his chin-proficiency, supported by another\r\nminstrel with a small violin. Boai’s performance has won the sympathies\r\nand suffrages of his audience, who have with one accord turned their\r\nbacks upon Sir A. Grant, and are applauding the new musical marvel.\r\nBoai’s agent is skilfully “working the oracle” while drawing attention\r\nto the rival booth:--\r\n\r\n    “The hon^{ble} Gentleman opposite has certainly a most\r\n    extraordinary chin, and when he places his claims to your\r\n    suffrages upon that broad and ample basis, it must be GRANTed\r\n    that he rests his hopes upon some foundation; but, Gentlemen,\r\n    the Candidate whom I propose to you possesses such transcendent\r\n    superiority in this important feature that I feel BOAIed\r\n    up with confidence, when I claim for him your triumphant\r\n    preference (cheers); and, Gentlemen, permit me to add that, in\r\n    the event of his return, which I now consider certain (cheers),\r\n    few orators in the hon: House will command more attention, or\r\n    be listened to with so much pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThat the interests of the Wellington Cabinet were in jeopardy is\r\npictorially conveyed. “The Unsuccessful Appeal” (September 25, 1830)\r\nshows John Bull arm-in-arm with the king, while Wellington is pointing\r\nto a distant movement amongst the crowd, and asking Mr. Bull’s\r\nprotection against his political foes. “My good old friend, I want\r\nyour assistance against these fellows, who are about to unite for the\r\npurpose of overpowering me by numbers.” The inimical confederates are\r\nBrougham and Lords Holland, Durham, Grey, etc., on the one side, who\r\nare fraternizing with Lord Eldon, the Duke of Cumberland, and others,\r\non the other. Johnny is thus responding to the old campaigner’s\r\nappeal:--\r\n\r\n    “I should be sorry to see you defeated by such an unholy\r\n    alliance after all the battles we have fought and won together;\r\n    but the fact is, I feel so oppressed with the glory of so many\r\n    victories, that I must beg to be excused from interfering any\r\n    more for the present in the disputes of others. There are,\r\n    however, plenty of clever fellows to be had, who are able and\r\n    willing enough to assist you, but when you again meet with\r\n    such, let me advise you not to be too ready to quarrel with\r\n    them!”\r\n\r\nWilliam IV. is quite at one with his friend, the last\r\nspeaker--“Whatever you say, John, I will agree to; for _your_ will is\r\n_my_ pleasure.”\r\n\r\nBefore the new parliament assembled, the Cabinet received some\r\ndamaging assaults from the press. The nature of this concealed warfare\r\nis explained by HB in his sketch of “A Masked Battery” (October 4,\r\n1830). The assailant is Henry Brougham: in his legal guise, entrenched\r\nbehind the “Result of the General Election,” with the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_ for a screen, he is bespattering his opponents, the beleaguered\r\n“Ins,” with ink. The Tory Cabinet is suffering severely: Wellington\r\nis to the front, trying to ward off the shower from Brougham’s\r\ninkstand-battery; in his hand is a damaging attack on paper,--“The\r\nDuke of Wellington and the Whigs.” Sir Robert Peel is endeavouring\r\nto shelter himself behind his chief. Lords Bathurst, Ellenborough,\r\nLyndhurst, and Aberdeen are all suffering from the assault.\r\n\r\nWhen the House met, we get a prospect of the prime minister reviewing\r\nhis forces--“A Cabinet Picture” (November 5, 1830). Wellington, with\r\nhis colleagues, Lords Aberdeen, Lyndhurst, Bathurst, Rosslyn, Melville,\r\nand others, whom the chief is thus addressing:--\r\n\r\n    “Having been obliged to recognize the King of the French,\r\n    we must, as a set-off--acknowledge our friend Miguel. The\r\n    Belgians--poor people!--not knowing how to take care of\r\n    themselves, must be protected from the evils of independence!\r\n    So much for foreign affairs, now for domestic. I say that\r\n    our present system is the very perfection of systems, and\r\n    consequently admits of no improvement; I will go further,\r\n    and say that, while I have power, no species of reform shall\r\n    take place! and now--having said it--if Peel will but manage\r\n    the new Police, Hardinge Ireland, Goulburn [Chancellor of the\r\n    Exchequer] abstain from projects of finance, and Ellenborough\r\n    hold his tongue, we may manage to keep our seats for another\r\n    session.”\r\n\r\nAfter the elections it was evident that things out-of-doors were moving\r\nantagonistically to the interests of the Wellington Cabinet, but the\r\n“Old Campaigner” still hoped by stratagem to keep in power, although\r\nresolute in asserting that while he kept office no species of reform\r\nshould take place. The premier’s optimist confidence “that his ministry\r\nmight keep their places for another session” is shown to be misplaced,\r\nfor the defeat of his ministry was clearly foreshadowed: “Guy Fawkes,\r\nor the Anniversary of the Popish Plot” (November 9, 1830), shows that\r\ndestruction was abroad; and this cartoon is a late exemplification of\r\nthe old British institution of burning in effigy a minister when out\r\nof favour. The political Guy is, of course, Wellington, the hero of\r\na hundred fights, reproduced in straw, tied to a rickety chair, and\r\nis gaily borne to the bonfire by a rejoicing mob of statesmen, his\r\npolitical antagonists. Lord Lansdowne leads the way, with a blazing\r\ntorch to fire the fatal pyre; the bearers are the Duke of Cumberland\r\nand Prince George (Duke of Cambridge), Lords Holland, Sidmouth, Eldon,\r\netc.; Aberdeen, Stanhope, and the Duke of Newcastle bring up the rear\r\nin a high state of exaltation;--these were the peers who “sapped the\r\nTory defences.”\r\n\r\nWellington was evidently losing popularity, and the lustre he gained\r\nin the field was being clouded in the Cabinet; John Bull has to come\r\nto his rescue against the rabble, and the valiant captain is once more\r\nshown sheltered under the king’s mantle. It appears the lord mayor’s\r\nbanquet was threatened with a hostile demonstration, and the city\r\nmagistrate, “Don Key,” was thrown into a deadly state of apprehension\r\nby the alleged prospect of being received with “cold indifference.”\r\nThis cartoon is entitled “The False Alarm; or, Much Ado about Nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe Wellington tenure of power was doomed, and, like Cæsar’s, his fatal\r\nstab was to come from the hand of a colleague, on the inopportune\r\nrevival of the Eastern Question. “Scene from the suppressed Tragedy,\r\nentitled the Turco-Greek Conspiracy,” shows the minister (wearing\r\nhis well-earned laurels) done to death by the Peers at the foot of\r\nCanning’s statue in the forum; the Senators being armed with deadly\r\nspeeches wherewith to accomplish this tragic immolation. “Et tu Brute”\r\nare the hero’s closing words addressed to his past comrade, Lord\r\nLondonderry, who is giving the _coup de grâce_.\r\n\r\nW. Heath, who was employed by McLean at the time Doyle’s sketches were\r\nmaking their appearance, has given many versions of events during\r\nGeorge IV.’s somewhat oppressive reign. At the close of 1830, with\r\nthe advent to the throne of a more constitutionally-minded sovereign,\r\nthe artist sums up the dismissal of a Cabinet whose actions he had\r\nfrequently criticized from a pictorially satirical point of view. In\r\nthe version of “His Honour the Beadle Driving the Wagabonds Out of the\r\nParish,” November 28, 1830, Heath has impressed Sir David Wilkie’s\r\nwell-known picture of “The Parish Beadle” into the service of parody.\r\nKing William IV., as the Bumble of the situation, is making a clean\r\nsweep of the relics of the past reign: “Come, be off: no hangers\r\nbehind--out with you all! I’ll let you see I represent the aristocracy\r\nof the parish!” John Bull, who may be considered to have generally\r\nendorsed his friend William’s policy with hearty goodwill, is giving\r\nhis approval: “That’s right, Master Beadle, do your duty and clear the\r\nparish of the varments; they’ve been a pest ever since they’ve been\r\nhere.” The chancellor Lyndhurst, Lord Ellenborough, Goulburn (late\r\nchancellor of the exchequer), and the rest, are making a hasty retreat.\r\nPeel, dragging his “new police” monkey attached to a string, is hardly\r\nreconciled to his banishment from office: “Vell, ve did all ve could to\r\nkick up a row afore ve vent!” Wellington, as the “hurdy-gurdy” woman,\r\ndressed in the faded splendours of an old soldier’s coat, is making all\r\nthe noise of which the instrument is capable while retreating with his\r\nface to the foe.\r\n\r\nThe results of the general election of 1830 culminated within a month\r\nof the reassembling of parliament in the substitution of a Whig for a\r\nTory ministry, and William IV.’s tenure of the throne was inaugurated\r\nby the early adoption of that liberal progress which developed into\r\nthe larger measure of reform within two years, the most memorable act\r\nof his reign. Doyle shows the ensuing distribution of offices, and\r\nsketches one of the intrigues for place--Henry Brougham, as “The\r\nCoquet,” being tempted by Lord Grey to a political allegiance, and\r\ncourted on the woolsack with the bait of the chancellor’s wig. After\r\nthe preliminary skirmishing and cementing of necessary alliances,\r\nthe end was short, sharp, and decisive, and is embodied by HB with\r\nhis customary point and felicity, as “Examples of the Laconic Style”\r\n(November 26, 1830). The king is “standing at attention;” he has\r\nsent for Lord Grey. “Your conditions?” The coming premier answers,\r\n“Retrenchment, Reform, and Peace.” “Done!” says the king, holding\r\nout his hand on the bargain. The Duke of Wellington, on the left,\r\nis stepping off the scene, while John Bull, to the right, is not\r\nreluctantly giving his late commander the order, “Right about face,\r\nmarch!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst.\r\n\r\nScarlett.\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough.\r\n\r\nGoulburn, Chancellor of Exchequer.\r\n\r\nDuke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nWilliam IV.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull.\r\n\r\nHIS HONOUR THE BEADLE (WILLIAM IV.) DRIVING THE WAGABONDS OUT OF THE\r\nPARISH. NOV. 28, 1830. By W. HEATH.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 354._]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the powerful Whig party came such sweeping reforms\r\nthat minds accustomed to the old order of things began to take fright.\r\nIt seemed that national institutions, and those fabled landmarks, “The\r\nbulwarks of the constitution,” bid fair to be swept away within six\r\nmonths, and another appeal to the constituencies was imminent. The\r\nTory views of the new order of things were embodied by Doyle (April 4,\r\n1831) in “A Very Prophetical and Pathetical Allegory,” in which it was\r\nforeshadowed that the institutions of the country could not survive\r\nreform, but must succumb within ten years. This vision conjures up a\r\ndeserted cemetery, wherein, in woeful anticipation, is erected the tomb\r\nof departed greatness: “Here lyeth the British Constitution, which,\r\nafter a rapid decline of ten years, departed this world, 1841.--I was\r\nwell; wishing to be better, here I am. _Sic transit gloria mundi._” The\r\nDuke of Wellington, as a widowed and ancient crony in deep sables, is\r\nshedding a tear, and depositing a wreath on the family vault, which is\r\npresumed to contain such honoured dust.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy forebodings of the Tories are further illustrated with much\r\nspirit in the guise of an expected game of “Leap-Frog down Constitution\r\nHill,” April 13, 1831, in which the Whigs are flying over the heads of\r\nthe opposition. On Constitution Hill stand Burdett, O’Connell, Hunt,\r\nand other advanced politicians, crying, “Go it, my boys; we shall soon\r\nhave it our own way;” the game is proceeding swimmingly down the slope.\r\nLord King has brought down an archbishop--the head of the Church; Lord\r\nAlthorp is sweeping down the judges; Lord Lansdowne has upset Lord\r\nEldon; Lord Durham directs the tall Duke of Cumberland to stoop his\r\nhead; Lord Brougham, in his chancellor’s robes, has alighted on the\r\nshoulders of the Duke of Wellington; William IV. has “tucked in his\r\nhead” and “made a back” for Lord Grey; but the premier, in his flying\r\nleap, has failed to clear the crown, which is sent spinning. “D----n it,”\r\nsays the king, “didn’t you tell me you wouldn’t touch the Crown?”\r\n\r\nThe coming appeal to the country was preceded by the usual political\r\nmeetings; this circumstance is made the subject of a felicitous parody,\r\n“_Anticipated_ Radical Meeting” (April 20, 1831). In one of Hunt’s\r\nMatchless (Blacking) carts stands the glib-tongued Radical in the full\r\ntide of his harangue; “Hunt, the Matchless Reformer,” is surrounded\r\nby the Tory party; the opposition consists of the ex-ministers, and\r\nincludes Sugden, Peel, Horace Twiss, Wetherell, Goulburn, Ellenborough,\r\nWellington, Aberdeen, and others, who are ironically welcoming and\r\nencouraging the oration. Hunt’s speech is thus reported:--\r\n\r\n    “Will the Bill, I ask, do away with places and pensions?\r\n    (Cheers.) Will it abolish tithes and taxes? (Cheers.) In a\r\n    word, will it make the poor rich and happy? (Great cheering.)\r\n    No! It will do none of these! therefore I say this Bill is all\r\n    a delusion! (Tremendous cheering and waving of hats.)”\r\n\r\nOld Eldon, mounted on the shoulders of his ally, the Duke of\r\nCumberland, is vociferously calling for “One cheer more!”\r\n\r\nThe House dissolved on the 22nd of April, and the fresh elections\r\ntook place in May. The nature of John Bull’s complaint and\r\nthe respective views of the rival practitioners who were\r\ncalled in for consultation are set forth by HB (May 2, 1831) as\r\n“Hoo-Loo-Choo--_alias_ John Bull and the Doctors.” The national\r\nprototype is seated in an arm-chair; his huge corporation seems to have\r\nbecome utterly unwieldy and inconvenient; he occupies the centre of\r\nthe picture. His doctors “in and out of place,” are on the respective\r\nsides. John Bull is addressing Lord Grey:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir F.

MAY 2,\r\n1831.\r\n\r\n  [_Page 357._]\r\n\r\n“I can’t say that my bodily health was ever better, or that I ever felt\r\nstronger, tho’ to be sure I am not growing younger; but then every one\r\nis telling me how deformed I am grown of late, and this tumour--which I\r\nhave had from my infancy--is all a mass of Corruption.”\r\n\r\nGrey, while indicating his colleagues, Althorp and Russell, says in\r\nreply, “This deformity is quite inconsistent, believe me, with the\r\nnature of your Constitution, and therefore must be got rid of. I will\r\nundertake, with your approbation, to remove it, and my assistant,\r\nDoctor Russell here, will prepare you for the operation.”\r\n\r\nRussell is observing, “I once thought that a case of this description\r\nought to be treated with great caution, and even wrote, as well as\r\ntalked, a great deal about it, but now I am quite of a different\r\nopinion. I think there is nothing like cutting away thro’ thick and\r\nthin!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, one of the dismissed doctors, on mature consideration,\r\nis inclined to question his past policy: “Yet I begin to think we\r\ncould have done better, when we found him determined to think that his\r\nConstitution was impaired, to have tried, just in the way of soothing,\r\na gentle alternative course.”\r\n\r\nDr. Wellington is still of his old opinion: “I say that the man has\r\nno defect in his Constitution, and that what they call Corruption is\r\nnecessary to his existence; but now, because he would not believe me,\r\nbut chose rather to submit to the experiments of those rash operators,\r\nWharncliffe, who is a sensible man, lays all the blame on me.”\r\n\r\nThe lively proceedings while the returns were preparing were fittingly\r\nepitomized by HB as “May Day” (May 4, 1831), setting forth as a\r\n“Jack-in-the-Green” performance the new revels of the revisers of the\r\nconstitution. The king occupies the green, which is topped by a crown,\r\nand bears the word “Reform;” the face of William IV. is peeping through\r\nthe aperture. Earl Grey is “My Lord;” Sir Francis Burdett is almost\r\nequally conspicuous. Hobhouse, Hume, and O’Connell are making a good\r\ndeal of rough music with shovels, and Russell has the Pandean pipes and\r\nbig drum, on which he is vigorously performing. Lord Brougham, as “My\r\nLady,” is going round with the ladle; he is interrogated by the Duke\r\nof Cumberland and Lord Eldon as to the “Man in the Green.” The Duke of\r\nGloucester and Lord Londonderry, among the audience, are regarding “My\r\nLady” with suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the new tactics is developed as “Leap-Frog on\r\na Level; or, Going Headlong to the Devil” (May 6, 1831). The turn of\r\nthe Reformers has come, and the Radicals are making them submit to\r\nthe same process as they lately inflicted on the Tories. Carlile is\r\nrolling over a churchman to the place of torment, having leaped a\r\ntrifle too far; the Evil One, as he declares in person, “has come to\r\nend your games.” “The Devil you are,” says the author of the tracts.\r\nSir Francis Burdett is unwillingly giving a back, “Have I stooped for\r\nthis?” His old ally, “Porcupine” Cobbett, is leaping heavily on to the\r\nbaronet’s shoulders, “My turn now, old Glory.” Grey is staggering while\r\nHunt is “overing” him: “I begin to think this is a very disorderly\r\ngame.” The mob are shouting, “Go it, Hunt,” which is displeasing to\r\nthe now elevated orator: “D---- the Rabble, they take me for one of\r\nthemselves.” Brougham is brought to his knees: “Hullo! you’ll have\r\noff my wig;” O’Connell, firmly seated on the chancellor’s back, is\r\ncrying, “Oh! never mind; _I’ll_ take care of that!” The king is brought\r\nto the earth; “This is the levelling system with a vengeance.” He is\r\noverturned by Hume, who is exclaiming, “This summing-up is the _tottle_\r\nof the whole.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hume on Lord King.\r\n\r\nDan O’Connell on Lord Brougham.\r\n\r\nOrator Hunt on Lord Grey.\r\n\r\nW.

A quantity of literature, in\r\nthe shape of broadsides, songs, and squibs of a startling character,\r\nwas produced on this occasion, in such abundance that even for small\r\nconstituencies in out-of-the-way places these _jeux d’esprit_ form\r\nhuge volumes. A number of parodies appeared on the great question\r\nof the Reform Bill, imitations of scripture among others. Of the\r\nballads published over the border, the one most descriptive of the\r\nconstitutional struggle is found in a parody of “Chevy Chase.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE NEW CHEVY CHASE.\r\n\r\n    “God prosper long our noble king,\r\n      Our lives and safeties all;\r\n    Some dreadful battles late there were\r\n      Fought in St. Stephen’s Hall.\r\n\r\n    “Long o’er the land, with pride and scorn,\r\n

Their pleasure in their borough towns\r\n      As formerly to take.\r\n\r\n    “For they would keep their borough towns,\r\n      Whate’er the King might say.\r\n    These tidings to Lord Russell came,\r\n      In Bedford, where he lay.\r\n\r\n    “Who sent the Tories present word,\r\n      He would prevent their sport;\r\n    These noble Lords not fearing him,\r\n      Kept up their old

Been lab’ring in vain,\r\n    And fencing round their borough towns,\r\n      That must be sieged and ta’en.\r\n\r\n    “The Bill-men muster’d on the hills,\r\n      Unable to endure;\r\n    They of their bare backs show’d a part,\r\n      Their clothing being poor.\r\n\r\n    “The ancient Whigs in front did stand,\r\n      Not one was seen to quake;\r\n    And with loud cries the hills and

be here.\r\n\r\n    “‘But now I think they will not come,\r\n      To meet us here this day.’\r\n    With that a trembling pensioner\r\n      Thus to the Duke did say:--\r\n\r\n    “‘Lo! yonder doth Lord Russell come--\r\n      Earl Grey is in my sight--\r\n    Behind I see a countless host,\r\n      And gloomy as the night.\r\n\r\n    “‘All men displeased, from hill and dale\r\n      The King’s name gives them head.’\r\n    ‘Fie on the King,’ said Wellington,\r\n      ‘Although I eat his bread.\r\n\r\n    “‘And, now, my proud preservatives,\r\n      Your courage to advance;\r\n    Upon the plains of Belgium,\r\n      You know I conquer’d France.\r\n\r\n    “‘And even the great Bonaparte,\r\n      That filled the world with fear,\r\n    I him encounter’d man for man\r\n      With Blucher

‘what right have ye\r\n      To kick up sic a steer,[65]\r\n    For a few dirty border towns,\r\n      Worth little goods or gear.’\r\n\r\n    “The first that then did answer make\r\n      Was Wellington so free,\r\n    Who said, ‘We’ll keep our borough towns,--\r\n      Corrupted though they be.\r\n\r\n    “‘For we have bought our borough towns\r\n      There’s none can that gainsay.’\r\n    Then Russell swore a solemn oath,\r\n      And likewise did Earl Grey.\r\n\r\n    “‘We will not thus outbravèd be:\r\n      Proud chief, thy strength we’ll try;\r\n    We know thee for a bloody man,\r\n      In this thy strength does lie.\r\n\r\n    “‘But as we wish for no man’s death,\r\n      Nor any blood to spill,\r\n    You see we’ve brought into the field\r\n      No weapons but a

quibbling lawyer forth,\r\n      Old Wetherell was his name,\r\n    Who said, ‘he would not have it told\r\n      In Boroughbridge for shame,\r\n\r\n    “‘That e’er his captain or himself,\r\n

I have power to use my tongue,\r\n      The robbers I will brand.’\r\n\r\n    “The Tory archers seized their shafts,\r\n      And a long-bow they drew,\r\n    But in the flight they wanted might,\r\n      And were not pointed true.\r\n\r\n    “To urge the battle in its need,\r\n      Lord Althorp bade the bent,\r\n    He was not filled with any pride,\r\n      But had a good intent.\r\n\r\n    “They clos’d full fast on every side,\r\n      They fought at every mound,\r\n    Till at the last the Tories yield,\r\n      And quit the common ground.\r\n\r\n    “O but it was a joy to see,\r\n      And likewise for to hear,\r\n    The grateful sounds that through the land\r\n      Came pealing on the ear.\r\n\r\n    “At last Duke Wellington and Grey\r\n      Came in each other’s sight;\r\n    Like lions roused they stand at bay,\r\n      And parley ere they fight.\r\n\r\n    “‘Yield thee, proud Captain,’ said Earl Grey,\r\n      ‘In name of our good King;\r\n    You little think, by this delay,\r\n      What mischief you may bring.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Thy praise I will most freely give,\r\n      And this report of thee,\r\n    Thou art the most outrageous Duke\r\n      That ever I did see.’\r\n\r\n    “‘To yield to thee,’ said Wellington,\r\n      ‘Would bring me nought but scorn;\r\n    Bring up the bishops to the fight,\r\n      And blow the gospel horn.’\r\n\r\n    “With that there came an arrow keen,\r\n      Out of a bishop’s bow,\r\n    That struck Earl Grey upon the head,\r\n      And almost laid him low.\r\n\r\n    “But still he spoke these cheering words,\r\n      ‘Fight on, my merry men all,\r\n    The bishops they are stumbling-blocks,\r\n      I’m stunn’d, but will not fall.”\r\n\r\n    “Then gaining strength, Lord Brougham took\r\n      The old Earl by the hand,\r\n    And bade him rest a little while,\r\n      While he took the command.\r\n\r\n    “O, but the very heart does bleed,\r\n      What sorrow does it make,\r\n    To see the holy men of God\r\n      Bound to a worldly stake.\r\n\r\n    “A peer amongst the Whigs there was,\r\n      Who did the bishops eye,\r\n    And instantly did vow revenge\r\n      Upon the carnal fry--\r\n\r\n    “The brave Lord King, well known to all,\r\n      Who, with the Bill in sight,\r\n    And mounted on an iron Grey,\r\n      Laid on from left to right.\r\n\r\n    “Lord Harrowby he swiftly past,\r\n      And Wharncliffe wav’ring near,\r\n    And sought the dastard bishops out,\r\n      Where they stood in the rear.\r\n\r\n    “With such a vehement force and might,\r\n      He drove down all before;\r\n    The Bill went through ’twixt Philpotts’[66] legs,\r\n      And turn’d him fairly o’er.\r\n\r\n    “So thus Earl Grey was well aveng’d,\r\n      And did no more complain;\r\n    A Tory archer then conceiv’d\r\n      That Philpotts he was slain.\r\n\r\n    “He had a bow bent in his hand,\r\n      Made of a rotten tree,\r\n    An arrow of the self-same root,\r\n      Without a head, drew he.\r\n\r\n    “Against the noble peer, Lord King,\r\n      The rotten shaft was set,\r\n    But wanting a good Grey goose wing,\r\n      It fell before it met.\r\n\r\n    “These battles they were fought at night,\r\n      Before the rising sun,\r\n    And when they rung the ev’ning bells,\r\n      Again the fray begun.\r\n\r\n    “There was not many nobles slain,\r\n      But some may yet atone;\r\n    Lord Eldon sunk, and his last speech\r\n      Is to all people known.\r\n\r\n    “Great Sir James Scarlett in the field\r\n      Was ta’en of small account;\r\n    John Wilson Croker would not yield,\r\n      His talking did surmount.\r\n\r\n    “For Wetherell I needs must wail,\r\n      As one in doleful dumps,\r\n    At Bristol town he took leg-bail,\r\n      With nothing but his stumps.\r\n\r\n    “On Russell’s side there did not fall,\r\n      A man who held degree,\r\n    But all yet live, and yet will fight,\r\n      If needs should ever be.\r\n\r\n    “With the Lord Durham, true and staunch\r\n      Did noble Stanley stand;\r\n    And Scotland, too, sustain’d her part,\r\n      Old Joseph shook his brand.\r\n\r\n    “And the Lord Althorp, he, likewise,\r\n      Disdained a foot to flee;\r\n    He held the bill still firm and fast,\r\n      And promis’d victory.\r\n\r\n    “Next day did many people come\r\n      Earl Grey for to bewail;\r\n    They found the old man at his post,\r\n      Determin’d to prevail.\r\n\r\n    “He had assurance from the King,\r\n      Who thus to him did say--\r\n    ‘Betide, betide, whate’er betide,\r\n      I will support thee, Grey.’\r\n\r\n    “The news was brought to Edinburgh,\r\n      Where the French King ’s again,\r\n    That Wellington had won the fight,\r\n      And that Earl Grey was slain.\r\n\r\n    “‘O joyful news,’ King Charles[67] said,\r\n      ‘Scotland will witness be,\r\n    That Wellington and Polignac[68]\r\n      Are Pears of the same tree.’\r\n\r\n    “Like tidings to King William came,\r\n      Within a shorter space--\r\n    Says he, ‘The bishops are great fools,\r\n      And really a disgrace.\r\n\r\n    “‘But God is with us,’ said the King,\r\n      ‘The people must be free,\r\n    I will create an hundred Peers,\r\n      If need should ever be.\r\n\r\n    “‘Yet shall not Wellington long boast\r\n      What mischief he does make:\r\n    I saw him lately with the Queen,\r\n      I doubt he is a rake.\r\n\r\n    “‘This vow the King he will perform,\r\n      In honour of the crown;\r\n    A hundred peers he can create,\r\n      Or knock a hundred down.\r\n\r\n    “‘Then Peers will be of small account,\r\n      And Peel that stood so high,\r\n    Because he wants consistency,\r\n      I think we’ll pass him by.’\r\n\r\n    “God save the King, and bless the land,\r\n      May all dissensions cease,\r\n    And grant henceforth that foul debates,\r\n      Like this, may end in peace.”\r\n\r\nThis view of the situation is followed up by a cartoon aimed at the\r\nopposition tactics, “Votaries at the Altar of Discord” (April 20,\r\n1831). Hunt is the high priest fanning the incendiary flame at the\r\nAltar of Discord, before which Sir Robert Peel, who seems to have\r\nrelinquished power reluctantly, as the mouthpiece of his kneeling\r\nfollowers, is offering this invocation: “Powerful Goddess, deign to\r\nhear our prayers; deserted in this, our great extremity, by justice and\r\nwisdom, we fly to thee as a last refuge.” The other devotees are Horace\r\nTwiss, Goulburn, Dawson, Sadler, Sir E. Sugden, Sir C. Wetherell, Earl\r\nCarnarvon, and the Dukes of Wellington and Newcastle. The opposition in\r\nthe Upper Chamber was in a highly excited state, an example of this\r\nis given in “Peerless Eloquence” (April 25, 1831). Lord Londonderry\r\nis boiling with indignation: “Is it to be endured, I ask, that we\r\nshould be called _things_--things with Human pretensions? What was\r\nthe fish-woman’s virtuous indignation at being called ‘an individual’\r\nto this? Nothing!” Brougham, on the woolsack, remains calm under the\r\ntorrent; Lords Aberdeen and Wharncliffe, with the Duke of Wellington,\r\nare placidly surveying the outraged senator.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of the innocents is figuratively told (May, 1831) in a\r\nnovel edition of the “Niobe Family.” Lord Grey is the destroyer, his\r\narrows are marked “Reform.” The Niobe of this version is the Duke of\r\nNewcastle; the smitten are Sir Charles Wetherell, Attwood, Sadler, and\r\nothers, whose constituencies were threatened with extinction under the\r\nReform Bill.\r\n\r\nThe motion for reform, then in full swing, is summed up from a Tory\r\nstandpoint (May 13, 1831); the legend of “John Gilpin” is pressed into\r\nthe service of the caricaturist.\r\n\r\n    “Away went Gilpin, neck or naught,\r\n      Away went hat and wig,\r\n    He little dream’d when he set out,\r\n      Of running such a rig.”\r\n\r\nWilliam IV. is, of course, the Gilpin of the situation; the bottles\r\nslung to his side are ginger-beer ones--“Rotunda Pop” and “Birmingham\r\nFroth;” the “Grey” horse is running away with the king at a dashing\r\npace, and the crown is dislodged in the scuffle. John Bull, the\r\npike-keeper, has thrown open his gate, and is highly excited at the\r\nsport: “Go it, my lads, never mind the turnpike!” Burdett is enjoying\r\nthe fun, but opines, “The Grey is evidently running away with him.”\r\nHume, Hunt, O’Connell, Cobbett, and others are following on horseback\r\nin the king’s wake. One cries, “Make way, make way; we’ve a great stake\r\ndepending on it.” The Irish Repealer is urging on the pace, “Go along,\r\nnever mind the geese and old women.” The “geese” wear coronets,\r\nto symbolize the scared peers scattered by the onslaught; and the “old\r\napple woman” capsized in the rush is old Eldon, the Tory ex-chancellor;\r\nCroker is a “croaking” raven. The sign of the inn is changed to a new\r\nversion of the Crown up in the oak tree, and the balcony is filled\r\nwith the late ministers, travestied as the ladies of the Gilpin party.\r\nWellington is distressed beyond measure at this alarming spectacle, and\r\nis appealing to John Bull: “Good Mr. Gatekeeper, stop him; he doesn’t\r\nknow where he is going!” Sir Robert Peel exclaims, “Oh, John Gilpin!\r\nJohn Gilpin! where are you going? Don’t you know your old friends?”\r\nGoulburn is declaring, “He must have lost his senses to ride at such a\r\nrate!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wellington.\r\n\r\nSir. R. Peel.\r\n\r\nGoulburn.\r\n\r\nJ.

The ghastly figure of Brissot, with his\r\ndecapitated head under his arm, is disclosed to the premier as a\r\nstartling vision, with a significant warning, drawn from his fatal\r\nrevolutionary experience:--\r\n\r\n    “To lead the mob, ‘mid faction’s storm\r\n    I rode my hobby-horse--Reform,\r\n      And had it all my own way.\r\n    Till other levellers ruled the mob,\r\n    And then I lost my seat and nob,\r\n      Take warning, my Lord Grey.”\r\n\r\n“Macbeth,” with the famous incantation scene, is impressed into the\r\nservice of parody to sum up the anticipated state of affairs before the\r\nmeeting of the House; “The Tricolored Witches” (June 6, 1831):--\r\n\r\n    “Black spirits and white,\r\n    Yellow spirits and Grey,\r\n    Mingle, mingle, mingle,\r\n    You that mingle may.”\r\n\r\nThere are five witches, wearing Republican red caps, and armed with\r\nbesoms of destructiveness, assembled round the cauldron.\r\n\r\nThe three chief witches are Lords Grey, Durham (“Yellow Lambton”), and\r\nBrougham. As the ingredients are cast into the blaze, fed by Durham\r\ncoal, Grey is singing the charm:--\r\n\r\n    “Forty years of toil and trouble\r\n    Like a hell-broth now shall bubble.\r\n    When the pot begins to boil,\r\n    Sons and daughters seize the spoil.\r\n    Double, double, toil and trouble,\r\n    Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.”\r\n\r\nLord Brougham takes up the invocation:--\r\n\r\n    “Freeman’s votes, and Grants by Charter.\r\n    First-born rights in ev’ry quarter,\r\n    Law and Justice, Church and King,\r\n    These the glorious spoils I bring.”\r\n\r\nLord Durham has his allotted share:--\r\n\r\n    “Saving-Banks, the Funds, and Rent,\r\n    Insurances and money lent,\r\n    Orphans’ Claims, and widows’ pittance,\r\n    Throw them in, to make a quittance.”\r\n\r\nLords Althorp and Russell are acting as the chorus:--\r\n\r\n    “Round about the cauldron go,\r\n    In the Constitution throw.”\r\n\r\nThe king is unexpectedly surprising the incantation. He is dumbfounded;\r\nthe charm is already active, and away flies his crown. He is girt with\r\na scarf, “Repentance,” and apostrophizes his reform friends:--\r\n\r\n                          “Filthy Hags!\r\n    Infected be the air whereon they ride,\r\n    And damn’d all those that trust them.”\r\n\r\n“A _Tale_ of a Tub--and the Moral of the _Tail_!” (June 13, 1831) is\r\nanother view of the critical juncture, as it was then assumed to be.\r\nThe old constitutional ship is left for the whale-boat. The monster\r\nis in such dangerous proximity that a dash from its tail--while\r\nsplashing “popular spray” over its would-be captors--threatens a\r\nfatal catastrophe. Lord Althorp has thrown over a pretty considerable\r\ntub, “Vested Interests and Chartered Rights;” “There,” he is made to\r\nexclaim, “amiable monster! In order to please you, we have thrown you\r\nall! Should you require more, you must only take ourselves.” Lord\r\nGrey is steering; Lords Brougham, Holland, and Durham have the oars.\r\nThe king, wearing his naval uniform, is trying to keep the crown from\r\nfalling overboard; he is evidently apprehensive of the worst: “But\r\nwhy approach so near the tail--the good-natured monster may, without\r\nmeaning any harm, upset us all in one of his gambols!” The man at the\r\nhelm is reassuring his chief: “My reasons for steering are pretty\r\nplain, tho’ fortunately for me some people don’t see them. It is by\r\nflattering the tail, that I command the head!” Lord Brougham, “the\r\nschoolmaster abroad,” is imparting this useful piece of knowledge: “It\r\nhas been discovered in the march of Intellect, that the _Tail_ often\r\noutstrips the _Head_!” Wellington and Peel have stuck to the ship; the\r\nlatter is still of opinion that he ought to have made an effort to\r\nretain his post: “Yet I can’t but think we might have succeeded in\r\namusing it for a long time with a very small _Keg_.” Wellington is less\r\nconfident: “I tell you, Bob, the Monster is not to be satisfied!”\r\n\r\nOther allusions of a seasonable character were also produced by Doyle,\r\napropos of the tendency of the epoch. One of the best is selected among\r\nmany, “Varnishing--a Sign (of _the Times_)” (June 1, 1831). The sign\r\nof the King’s Head is undergoing renovation; Lord Brougham, in his\r\nchancellor’s robes, is mounted on a ladder, and employed in touching up\r\nthe royal countenance with a pot of varnish. “I think that, considering\r\nI was not bred to the trade, I am not a bad hand at bedaubing a King.\r\nAfter all, to produce effect, I find there is nothing like plenty of\r\nvarnish.” Lord Grey, from an open window, is surveying with marked\r\nsatisfaction his colleague’s work. “Canning used to talk about a Red\r\nLion; but I say that, in our reforming times, there is no such sign for\r\na (re) publican as a King’s Head, although a Star and Garter is not to\r\nbe despised!”\r\n\r\nThe somewhat well-worn subject of the hustings is also treated\r\npictorially amongst the cartoons which appeared during the elections.\r\nOne version is entitled, “The _Rival_ Mount-O’-_Bankes_; or, the\r\nDorsetshire Juggler” (May 25, 1831). The scene of the hustings is again\r\ntravestied as a fair. “Bankes and Co.’s Old-Established Booth” is left\r\nquite deserted; a pillar of the Church is the solitary patron. “If our\r\nfriends don’t come up faster, we may shut up shop,” says the showman;\r\nwhile his assistant is declaring, in allusion to the success of the\r\nrival show, “This Juggler is juggling all our customers away from us!”\r\nThe “Nonpareil Juggler” has, in fact, monopolized all the custom. Lord\r\nGrey is the showman; he is holding forth his programme to the numerous\r\npatrons: “The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill of the\r\nPerformance of the Nonpareil Calcraft.” The showman, “Grey, Licensed\r\nDealer in Curiosities,” is pointing to a glowing picture of\r\nthe entertainment to be seen within--Calcraft, in the very act of\r\nswallowing a lengthy speech dead against the principles of the reform\r\nparty as represented by Lord Grey; he is described as “Lately exhibited\r\nin the metropolis by Monsieur Villainton, with unheard-of success.” The\r\ncustomers are thus exhorted:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King William IV.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham.\r\n\r\nLord Grey.\r\n\r\nVARNISHING--A SIGN (OF “THE TIMES”).

Here you may see the most wonderful\r\n    Juggler, _who eats his own words!_ not at all in the usual way\r\n    practised by pretenders to the ‘Craft, and which is now become\r\n    almost as common a trick as swallowing the sword, but in a\r\n    manner the most extraordinary and unparalleled! He likewise\r\n    plays off many strange antics, quite peculiar to himself and\r\n    most curious and amusing to behold. I aver, gemmen, I challenge\r\n    the universal world to produce such a show as this here Juggler\r\n    makes of himself!”\r\n\r\nThe crowds are flowing in,--says one, “I am tired of Bankes’s Booth,\r\nbesides, this _promises_ more amusement;” and another, “I like novelty,\r\nso here goes.”[70]\r\n\r\nDoyle has given a clever embodiment of a current political situation,\r\nborrowed from the illustrious humourist, his predecessor: “LINEal\r\nDescent of the Crown.” See Hogarth’s works, “Four Prints of an\r\nElection” (June 23, 1832). A modernized version of the sign of the\r\n“Crown” is dependent from a beam; Lord Grey, with his face to the\r\nbuilding, is seated upon that portion of the support which he is\r\nhacking lustily with a sickle, marked “Bill.” Cobbett, Hume, and\r\nO’Connell are tugging away at the rope which is to accomplish the\r\ndownfall. The former exclaims, “If we act in union, we’ll soon bring it\r\nto our own level.” Hunt remarks, “I fear his exalted seat will turn his\r\nhead.” O’Connell is encouraging the dangerous exertions of the Reform\r\nchief: “Ply the Bill well there, Grey, and it will soon be all down.”\r\n\r\nA reference to the possible effects of changed politics upon the\r\nsuffrages of constituencies is slyly conveyed by HB’s sketch of “The\r\nCast-off Cloak.” Sir John Hobhouse is standing at the entrance of\r\nthe War Office; he has removed the red-lined cloak of “Radicalism,”\r\nwhich he is thrusting on his old colleague, Sir Francis Burdett: “Pray\r\nrelieve me of this, Burdett. I shall find it a great incumbrance in\r\na _warm_ place like this.” The reply of the veteran Sir Francis is\r\nmore politic: “Ay, but don’t forget that you have an engagement in\r\nCovent Garden.[71] You may find the atmosphere rather _cool_ in that\r\nquarter.” Burdett’s own political convictions were to undergo as sudden\r\na transmutation, as HB has illustrated a few years later.\r\n\r\nAs it was felt by the Conservative party that the king, by whose\r\ninstrumentality the important measure of reform was alone carried,\r\nwas bound on an enterprise of which the results were doubtful, and,\r\naccording to their apprehensions, desperate, they tenaciously fought\r\nfor the inviolability of corruption.\r\n\r\n    “With nigh two hundred Tories bold,\r\n      All men of the old light,\r\n    Who knew full well, but would not own,\r\n      They were not in the right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “And long before this time they had\r\n      Been lab’ring in vain,\r\n    And fencing round their borough towns\r\n      That must be sieged and ta’en.”\r\n\r\n  (_New Chevy Chase._)\r\n\r\nAccording to Doyle’s new version of “Mazeppa” (August 7, 1832), the\r\nking is bound and tied to “Reform,” represented as “the wild horse of\r\nthe steppes,” surrounded by wolves, some of whom bear Tory visages,\r\namong which the face of the Duke of Wellington is easily identified.\r\nHorse and rider are overleaping the barrier of “Vested Interests,”\r\nwhile beneath the courser rushes the “Revolutionary Torrent,” whose\r\nvolume is increasing. The success of this spirited version induced the\r\ndesigner to publish a second plate (September 25th), presenting\r\nthe sequel. It is evident in this--which exhibits the wild horse,\r\nand Mazeppa, his rider, extended on the plains, but apparently\r\nuninjured--that the threatening vortex of the “Revolutionary Torrent”\r\nhas been passed, and neither has been swamped; but the king is landed\r\nin the midst of the herd of wild steeds, weirdly careering round the\r\nprostrate pair are the rest of the tribe, on whose heads appear the\r\nfaces of the leading advocates of reform--Lord Brougham, Lord Grey,\r\nDuke of Richmond, Lord John Russell, Lord Althorp, Sir James Graham,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAZEPPA--“AGAIN HE URGES ON HIS WILD CAREER.” AUG. 7,\r\n1832.

The Ministers are\r\nhalf-seas-over; Grey is singing “Here’s Comfort when we Fret;” Russell\r\nis joining in the chorus. Althorp declares, “I am quite overpowered;”\r\nand Brougham, who has further been presented with a gold toddy-ladle,\r\nis crying, “Ah, this is now the greatest consolation we have left. I\r\nwish some one would give poor Palmy a cup!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ELECTIONEERING, 1833 TO 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Doyle, as a Tory satirist, was eagerly anticipating indications\r\nof change in the popular sentiments. His warnings on the Reform Bill\r\nhad fallen unheeded, and the Whig party was still strong in power.\r\nHB ventured on the hint that the Tories were only temporarily in\r\ndisfavour, and that they had but to adapt themselves to the times\r\nand resume office. The “Waits” (January, 1833) gives an ingenious\r\nand novel view of political matters. John Bull, in dressing-gown and\r\ndouble night-cap, is leaning out of his first-floor window in critical\r\ncontemplation of the minstrels’ efforts to please his ear. The Duke\r\nof Wellington, with the smallest of fiddles, has the leadership of\r\n“the waits.” Lord Ellenborough (trombone), Sir Robert Peel (flute),\r\nand Lord Aberdeen (’cello) are the midnight harmonists. The awakened\r\nhouseholder, Mr. Bull, is requesting a more piquant programme: “I’m\r\ntired of your eternal ‘God save the King’ and ‘Rule Britannia,’--give\r\nus something French--‘The Marseillaise’ or ‘The Parisienne.’”\r\nWellington, touching his hat, replies, “Please your Honour, we don’t\r\nplay them ’ere tunes.”\r\n\r\n“Sindbad the _Sailor_ and the Old Man of the Sea!” (_vide_ fifth\r\nvoyage, June 8, 1833) was published after the dissolution. William\r\nIV. is, of course, the marvellous traveller, and the incubus he has\r\nsubmitted to get settled on his shoulders is the reforming premier,\r\nLord Grey.\r\n\r\nThat parliamentary reform, though commenced, was by the extreme\r\nparty considered but an imperfect measure, is pictorially illustrated\r\nin various designs by HB; for instance, the elusive “Time” is shown\r\nrunning away with the great Whig Reform Bill, and Lord Althorp is\r\nseen tearing after the vanishing roll, crying, “Stop thief!” He\r\nhas the _Times_ in his pocket, presumably the organ by which John\r\nBull’s course was piloted, and is vainly trying to come up with the\r\ndeparting thief and his measure, one tiny corner Lord Althorp has torn\r\noff, “Schedule A,” and that promises to be all he can save from the\r\nabduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINDBAD THE SAILOR AND THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA. JUNE 8,\r\n1833. BY J. DOYLE (HB).]\r\n\r\nAnother version, also by Doyle, embodies in graphic form the views of\r\nthe root-and-branch reformers; a grand trio of Sir Francis Burdett,\r\nthen a prominent Radical; Joseph Hume, who was all for economic reform,\r\nin which important branch he has left no true successor; and Daniel\r\nO’Connell, a most important factor in his time, whose covert designs\r\nwere nothing less than “Repeal.” These gentlemen, who were among the\r\nmost conspicuous politicians of their day, are linked arm-in-arm as\r\nthe “Three Great Pillars of Government; or, A Walk from White Conduit\r\nHouse to St. Stephen’s” (July 23, 1834); published under the same\r\nauspices of Thomas McLean, at the Haymarket Gallery, as the other\r\nexamples of Doyle’s satirical ability reproduced in this summary. Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett is with much spirit advocating “Equal Representation\r\nand Annual Parliaments--and _that_ (a snap of the fingers) for the\r\nBorough-mongers.” Hume is applauding this resolute front: “Bravo! and\r\nCheap Government;” to which Daniel O’Connell is adding, “And Universal\r\nSuffrage, and Vote by BALLOT, eh?” with, as a supplement, in a\r\nvery small whisper, “A Repeal of the Union.”\r\n\r\nWhen another general election occurred, the situation of honest John\r\nBull was figured as that of a stout gentleman wishing to be carried\r\non his road, but distracted as to the conveyance he must choose. The\r\nTory ’bus stands contrasted with the new reform steam vehicle, which is\r\ncrowded with experimentalists. “The Opposition ‘Busses” is the title\r\nof this version, also due to HB. The Duke of Wellington is trying to\r\nsecure John Bull for his old coach, which does not seem much patronized.\r\n\r\n    “Don’t trust ’em, Sir, and their new-fangled machinery. Can’t\r\n    get on at all without being kept in constant hot water, and\r\n    sure to blow up in the end; with us you’ll be much more safe\r\n    and comfortable,--careful driver, steady train’d horses, and\r\n    rate of going much faster than formerly.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Francis Burdett.\r\n\r\nJoseph Hume.\r\n\r\nDaniel O’Connell.\r\n\r\nTHREE GREAT PILLARS OF GOVERNMENT; OR, A WALK FROM WHITE CONDUIT HOUSE\r\nTO ST.

Steam-coaches were fashionable\r\nnovelties in 1834; the uncomfortable-looking, nondescript new\r\nconveyance, with its steam up, is crowded with statesmen. O’Connell,\r\nLord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, and Lord Palmerston are\r\ndistinguishable. Hume is touting for his new invention:--\r\n\r\n    “You are not such a silly Chiel as to go with them old screws?\r\n    Eh, you’ll never get to your journey’s end. Ours is the new\r\n    grand-junction Steam Omnibus, constructed upon scientific and\r\n    feelosophical principles--warranted to go at race-horse speed,\r\n    and no stopping.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESIGN FOR THE KING’S ARMS, TO BE PLACED OVER THE NEW\r\nSPEAKER’S CHAIR.

Such a suggestion is offered\r\nin Doyle’s “Original Design for the King’s Arms, to be placed over the\r\n_New_ Speaker’s Chair,” where old Cobbett, late “Peter Porcupine,”\r\nthe persistent agitator, who obtained a seat in Parliament after the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill, is playfully substituted as the British\r\nLion; and the high-bred Sir Francis Burdett, who, as is seen in these\r\nelectioneering illustrations, had so long figured before the public\r\nas a Radical reformer, and was now beginning to turn to the Tory\r\ninterest, is usurping the position in the royal escutcheon generally\r\nappropriated to the fabled unicorn.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the ballot was not ardently desired by the Tories, and\r\nit was hinted that the consequences of its introduction would entail\r\nsuch inconveniences as are figured in the two illustrations here\r\ngiven, rather implying that violence and coercion would henceforth be\r\nunavailing, and that, as bribery would be in vain also, administrative\r\ncorruptors would prefer to make a more legitimate use of their money.\r\n\r\nA ballad of the “broadside” order appeared upon “The Windsor Election”\r\nof 1835. As a genuine rough-and-ready production, called forth by\r\nthe circumstances of the contest, and embodying the names of the\r\ncandidates, it is worth preserving as typical of thousands of similar\r\nballads, which have in all probability perished from the bills of\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n    “What a wonderful thing’s an Election!\r\n      It sets all the people alive;\r\n    And makes them all busy and nimble,\r\n      Like so many bees in a hive.\r\n    ’Tis then the nobs learn to be civil,\r\n      And get all their lessons by rote;\r\n    With ‘How do you do? Honest friend,\r\n      I’m come to solicit your vote.’\r\n\r\n    “There’s enough of that humbug just now,\r\n      To be seen in a neighbouring town,\r\n    Where the voters don’t scruple to say\r\n      The whole will be dear for a _Crown_.\r\n    They’re professing to canvass for truth,\r\n      Which all honest folks must deny,\r\n    For ’tis plain as the nose on your face,\r\n      They’ll gammon you all with--_a-lie_.[72]\r\n\r\n    “Then, to think of that corporate body,\r\n      All their mind on the thing is agog;\r\n    They’ll be gammon’d as surely by him\r\n      As they formerly were with their hog.\r\n    Just fancy that day at the hustings,\r\n      You see that comical crop,\r\n    The old soldier playing first fiddle\r\n      To the tune of the Bachelor’s Hop.\r\n\r\n    “When they’ve scrap’d and fiddled away,\r\n      And find little company come,\r\n    The Fiddler will soon bag his kit,\r\n      And then the day’s work will be done.\r\n    The people may think this is wise (Vyse),\r\n      But the thing will be well understood,\r\n    For a man to fiddle all day\r\n      Should be made of cast iron or wood (Col. Wood).\r\n\r\n    “Now to see the phizogs of this crew,\r\n      As they travel away cheek-by-jowl,\r\n    Led on by old Dot-and-go-one,\r\n      A-scratching the head _of his poll_.\r\n    At the warmints he’s storming and raving,\r\n      And wishing ’em all at the Devil,\r\n    Whilst Sir John,[73] and the rest of his staff,\r\n      Are cursing the Bachelor’s Revel.\r\n\r\n    “Success to Sir John de Beauvoir,\r\n      He’s a man that is loyal and true,\r\n    He’ll strangle that monster--corruption,\r\n      And live to bury him, too.\r\n    Whilst the ghost of old Elley, in pity,\r\n      To the Corporate body will come,\r\n    In a vision, with two bags of money,\r\n      On the back of old Dot-and-go one.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCONVENIENCES THAT MIGHT HAVE ARISEN FROM THE BALLOT.\r\nBY G.

At the\r\nbeginning of 1837, HB produced a figurative prospect of the situation,\r\nas “A New Instance of the Mute--ability of Human Affairs.” The British\r\nConstitution, that fabled “admiration of surrounding nations,” and\r\n“monument of the collective wisdom of generations,” is at last\r\nmoribund: the fatal hour has arrived, and the chamber of mourning is\r\npresented to view. Mounted upon sable trestles, and covered with a rich\r\npall, is the coffin which contains the defunct, according to the plate,\r\n“Died 1837, of the prevailing Influenza, the British Constitution of\r\n1688, aged 149 years;” the mutes, with trappings of woe, stationed on\r\neither side of the coffin, are Lord John Russell and Spring Rice.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1837, HB gave the public a version of that appeal to the\r\nconstituencies, then becoming more imminent: “Going to the Fair with\r\nIt. A cant phrase for doing anything in an extravagant way--known, it\r\nis presumed, to most persons.” The three performers are in the thick\r\nof the fair, within the circle of booths; one tent has the sign of the\r\n“King’s Head,” with the Union Jack flying, another mounts the sign\r\nof “The Mitre.” Dan O’Connell is seated on the ground as a conjuror,\r\nwith a paraphernalia of swords, rings, and balls--“Irish titles and\r\nappropriation clause” among the former. He is performing the “great\r\nsword-swallowing trick,” with a blade marked “Repeal.” Spring Rice,\r\ndressed as a tumbler, is balancing a block on a stick which rests\r\non his chin. The chief attraction, the only performance which is\r\nabsorbing the wonder of the entire spectators, is that of the acrobat,\r\nLord John Russell, who is sustaining himself in the air raised on\r\na single support, marked, “Irish Corporation Bill.” John Bull, who\r\noccupies the central position, cannot disguise his interest in the\r\nfeat: “Well done, little ’un; you’ve got up a surprising height--take\r\ncare how you let yourself down.” The Duke of Wellington is counselling\r\nJohn Bull: “These tricks are decidedly dangerous, and should not be\r\nencouraged.” Sir Robert Peel and Lord Stanley are in conference, as\r\nretired professors of conjuring. “This is the great trick now--the\r\nstilts are quite discarded.” A bishop is observing, “That man balances\r\nvery inequitably.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side are grouped various critics of the performance.\r\nLord Ebrington considers the trick “wonderful, even more astonishing\r\nthan the Stilts.” Sir William Molesworth declares, “They deserve\r\nencouragement, but they don’t go half as far as they ought.” Hume also\r\nthinks, “it is very well as far as it goes!” Lord Brougham, wearing his\r\ndistinguishing plaid trousers, is in conference with Mr. Roebuck as to\r\nstarting an opposition show: “What do you think if we were to set up a\r\nlittle concern of our own: you would make a very nice little Tumbler,\r\nand I--you know, am an old hand that way!” Sir Francis Burdett, who had\r\ngiven some surprising performances in his time, is leaving the fair,\r\ndeclaring, “I can’t stand it any longer;” while his associate, Sir J.\r\nC. Hobhouse, advises him to wait a while, “Don’t go yet; the best of\r\nthe sport is to come!”\r\n\r\nThe struggles, twists, and contortions of ministers to keep in place,\r\nand the involutions of “Ins and Outs,” were ably parodied, a few months\r\nbefore the dissolution, as the “Fancy Ball--Jim Crow Dance and Chorus”\r\n(April 17, 1837); in which the most prominent movers of both parties\r\nare travestied in fancy costumes, out-at-elbows, and with blackened\r\nfaces--the likenesses admirably preserved; and executing a reel worthy\r\nof “Chimney Sweeps’ Day;” the whole arranged to the then-popular air\r\nof “Jump Jim Crow,” introduced at that time by an actor named Rice--the\r\nforerunner of the “Christy Minstrels” of a later generation. The\r\ncentral figures are--O’Connell, who is making a contemptuous gesture,\r\nand his partner, Lord Melbourne; Wellington and Peel are _vis-à-vis_;\r\nStanley and Graham are jigging gaily together, so are Lords Abinger and\r\nLyndhurst; Sir Francis Burdett and General de Lacy Evans are figuring\r\nback-to-back in approved Irish-jig style; and Spring Rice is getting on\r\nwell to a lively measure along with Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\n    “Behold the Politician!\r\n      Out of place he’ll never go,\r\n    But to keep it, don’t he turn about\r\n        And jump Jim Crow?\r\n\r\n    “Turn about, and wheel about,\r\n        And do just so,\r\n    The only Cabinet Quadrille\r\n        Is jump Jim Crow!”\r\n\r\nSir Francis Burdett--the “seven-stringed Jack” and admirer of the\r\nFrench revolution of Gillray’s cartoons, the fiery Radical of\r\nCruikshank’s early flashing squibs--after a career of remarkable\r\nprominence as a zealous innovator and friend of reform, quixotically\r\nriding full tilt against abuses of all kinds, was exhibiting himself,\r\nin the session about to close his old career, as a convert to fine\r\nfull-bodied Tory principles. HB has pictorially given the contests\r\nthe famous baronet had waged with the mighty Dan O’Connell, whose\r\n“repealing” proclivities seem finally to have opened Burdett’s eyes\r\nas to the desirability of preserving the integrity of the kingdom.\r\nHis highly characteristic speech at the Westminster hustings is the\r\nbest exposition of his changed opinions. In his picture of “A Fine\r\nOld English Gentleman, One of the Olden Time” (May 10, 1837), Doyle\r\nhas commemorated the baronet’s final accession to the country party,\r\nby drawing Sir Francis in his familiar guise--blue coat, tightly\r\nbuttoned, with swallow tails, white vest and ample white cravat, white\r\ncords, and top-boots,--seated, a prisoner in his own apartments,\r\nsuffering from an attack of gout. A picture of the Tower, hung on the\r\nwall, indicates a previous episode of imprisonment, when Burdett became\r\nan inmate of that edifice (April 6, 1810); he was the last political\r\nprisoner confined there. It was felt that the baronet’s connection with\r\nWestminster was about to be severed; however, he offered himself for\r\nre-election, that his old constituents might pronounce upon his action.\r\n\r\nThe candidature of Mr. Leader formed the subject of several of Doyle’s\r\nsuggestive sketches. In “Following the Leader” (May 12, 1837), HB\r\nhas given a fanciful version of the candidate’s supporters impressed\r\nas boardsmen. O’Connell heads the file, with a placard “Leader for\r\nWestminster.” Lord Melbourne is advertising “Leader and Reform of the\r\nHouse of Lords.” Lord John Russell, as a “sandwich” man, announces\r\n“Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and Vote by Ballot;” Lord\r\nPalmerston’s board declares, “I am a Tory, and was always a Tory.” Sir\r\nWilliam Molesworth, Hume, and others bring up the rear, with “Leader\r\nfor Westminster” placards. The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel\r\nare surveying the demonstration from a distance, “These, I suppose, are\r\nsome of the Pismires!”\r\n\r\n“May Day in 1837” is another ingenious version of the political\r\nsituation. The figure enclosed in the green, which is surmounted by\r\nthe crown, is the king, William IV.; he is getting nervous at his\r\nsituation: “I have got into a warm berth, it must be owned; indeed,\r\nit grows rather Hellish.” Melbourne makes a handsome “my lord,” and\r\nRussell’s figure just suits “my lady.” Lord Morpeth is a serviceable\r\nclown. The whole dance is performed to the drum accompaniment of Dan\r\nO’Connell. Spring Rice, as chancellor of the exchequer, is going\r\nround to John Bull for the supplies, much to the national prototype’s\r\nsurprise: “You little spooney! How came you to be entrusted with the\r\nladle, eh?” Sir Francis Burdett, still in his sweep’s disguise, is\r\nstalking off from the concern: “These ’ere fellers grow so werry wulgar\r\nthat a gentlemen can’t keep company with them no longer.”\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that Sir Francis Burdett,--finally forsaking\r\nthose Radical principles upon which he had been returned in the first\r\ninstance for Westminster in 1807--for which important city he had sat\r\nuntil 1837,--appealed to the constituency which had elected him for\r\nthirty years, and, with that chivalrous spirit which distinguished\r\nhis nature, challenged the votes of his supporters as to how far his\r\nchanged politics might enlist their approval, and invited his friends\r\nto pronounce their verdict on his conduct. Upon the baronet’s appeal to\r\nhis constituents, in the character of “a fine old English gentleman,\r\nall on the Tory side,” when, in May, 1837, he resigned his membership\r\nfor Westminster as a Radical, and offered himself as a Tory candidate,\r\nhe was opposed by John Temple Leader, a prominent Radical politician.\r\nParty feeling was considerably intensified, and ungenerous efforts\r\nwere made by his late Radical colleagues to inflict the mortification\r\nof a defeat upon the reformed baronet. The famous agitator, Daniel\r\nO’Connell, whose collision with Burdett was among the chief causes of\r\nhis changed opinions, exerted himself to the utmost to bring about the\r\ndiscomfiture of his opponent, who, in return, dealt scathing contempt\r\nupon the arch-agitator. Many political satires and squibs were produced\r\non this occasion, and, in a literary and artistic point of view,\r\none feature of great interest associated with this incident was the\r\nappearance of an electioneering caricature by the author of “Vanity\r\nFair.” The Marquis of Wharton, Swift, Burns, Sir Hanbury Williams,\r\nCanning, Moore, and many eminent poets, writers, and statesmen have\r\noriginated electioneering ballads, and Thackeray has associated his\r\nname with a pictorial squib; in 1837, he was, as part-proprietor and\r\ncontributor, associated with the unfortunate venture (as regards the\r\ninroad its subsequent failure made on his fortune), the _Constitutional\r\nand Public Ledger_--a daily journal, of ultra-liberal views; and as\r\nits programme included extension of popular franchise, vote by ballot,\r\nequal civil rights, religious liberty, and short parliaments, it may\r\nbe imagined that the political creed which he at that time professed\r\ninclined Thackeray to look with disfavour upon the converted Burdett as\r\nan apostate from his faith: he has expressed this view in a political\r\nsatire addressed to the electors of Westminster. The picture, a quarto\r\nleaf, was presented with the _Guide_ (May 13, 1837). It represents Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett and his opponent, Leader, on the hustings, as “The\r\nRivals; or, Old Tory Glory and Young Liberal Glory.” Sir Francis is\r\nrepresented as decrepit, and a martyr to the gout--another attribute of\r\na “fine old English gentleman”--from which the baronet suffered much in\r\nlater life; his foot is swathed in flannel, and crutches support him to\r\nstand; his coat is worn inside out, and a glory round his head alludes\r\nto an expression of “pismire voters” he had applied to the following of\r\nhis antagonists. Beneath the picture is a further explanation of the\r\nsatirist’s meaning:--\r\n\r\n    “Historical truth has compelled the artist to portray the\r\n    physical infirmities which keep Sir Francis from all duties\r\n    except that of dining at the Pavilion; but our readers will\r\n    recollect that that infirmity is the gout--one which mankind\r\n    seem, by common consent, to have determined never to regard\r\n    with compassion.... A picture of the Tower is seen in the\r\n    background; and Sir Francis, with a ‘glory’ of ‘pismires’ round\r\n    his head, is depicted as hobbling away in his turned coat from\r\n    the recollections, as from the principles, of his youth.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his sudden conversion, the electors of Westminster held\r\ntheir respected member in too much veneration to inflict upon him the\r\nignominy of rejection; the wielder of the “Herculean club,” depicted\r\nas the foremost leader among the “plebs” by George Cruikshank, who\r\nhas described the object of his shafts as “the eloquent and noble Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett,” was placed at the head of the poll by a majority of\r\nfive hundred votes over his antagonist, Leader, who had come forward\r\nas the Radical champion to oppose his return. Sir Francis Burdett is\r\nso prominent a personage in the annals of electioneering, as well as\r\nin those of parliamentary history, that a specimen of his eloquence\r\nmay not be out of place; especially as the speech which he made to his\r\nconstituents after the declaration of the poll by the high bailiff\r\nof Westminster is an admirable example of the orations which may be\r\nconsidered appropriate to these memorable occasions on the part of\r\nthe successful candidate. Sir Francis rested his firm attitude on his\r\nantipathy to see the British empire _dismembered_: history repeats\r\nitself, and it was on the question of “Repeal of the Union” that he\r\nbroke with his party.\r\n\r\n\r\n“SPEECH OF SIR FRANCIS BURDETT ON HIS FINAL RETURN FOR WESTMINSTER,\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n    “GENTLEMEN, ELECTORS OF THE CITY AND LIBERTIES OF\r\n    WESTMINSTER--\r\n\r\n    “It now becomes my pleasing task to return you my most\r\n    sincere and grateful thanks for the high honour which you\r\n    have again conferred upon me. In the first place, I have to\r\n    thank you for the arrangements that you have made, and for the\r\n    consideration you have manifested in regard to the present\r\n    state of my health, and for the relief your attention has\r\n    afforded me from those duties which would have been painful\r\n    and difficult on this great and important occasion, and which\r\n    has rendered my part in the struggle comparatively easy and\r\n    full of satisfaction. (Cheers.) Permit me to congratulate you\r\n    upon the noble, the patriotic, the independent efforts you have\r\n    made, and through you, gentlemen, to congratulate the people at\r\n    large upon the glorious triumph of the English constitution,\r\n    which has been achieved against the vain and futile efforts\r\n    of Radicalism and democracy. Gentlemen, I congratulate you\r\n    upon the firm determination you have shown to maintain all the\r\n    great and inestimable institutions of this country against the\r\n    efforts of her enemies. (Loud cheers, with faint hisses.) The\r\n    task which I have now to perform is both short and pleasant,\r\n    and I shall not now detain you, after the triumph you have\r\n    achieved and the victory you have won, merely to indulge my\r\n    own feelings of exultation and of gratification; but this I\r\n    will say, that the electors of Westminster have by the result\r\n    of their noble and patriotic exertions set an example to the\r\n    people of England, to be looked up to and followed; and in\r\n    every part of this great nation I make no doubt but that this\r\n    brilliant example will have the happy effect of sending good\r\n    men, who love their country and venerate her constitution, to\r\n    unite for their defence, and at the same time to defeat the\r\n    machinations and conspiracies of the bad. (Loud applause.) I\r\n    will not dwell on these subjects, but this much I will observe,\r\n    that you are much indebted even to your enemies for the signal\r\n    triumph you have so nobly and so gloriously achieved. (Great\r\n    cheering.) The malignity and malice of some persons have done\r\n    much to aid the cause of the constitution; but I should say\r\n    that if there is one individual to whom you are more indebted\r\n    than any other, that person certainly was Mr. Daniel O’Connell.\r\n    (Loud cheers and groans.) The attacks of that individual have\r\n    tended to serve the cause which they were designed to injure.\r\n    Gentlemen, the big beggarman of Ireland (renewed cheers)\r\n    has mistaken the good sense and patriotism of the people of\r\n    England. He has intruded himself with his uncalled-for advice\r\n    upon the electors of Westminster, and with (as it now turns\r\n    out) his disregarded threats. He has intruded that advice and\r\n    those suggestions in an Irish letter, couched in a strain more\r\n    Irish than Irish itself (loud laughter), and containing in\r\n    every point that mixture of blarney and bully, the former of\r\n    which has only excited the disgust, and the latter the contempt\r\n    of the electors of Westminster. (Loud cheers, groans, and\r\n    laughter.) I know not what influence that letter may be said\r\n    to have had upon His Majesty’s ministers; but this I know,\r\n    that the people of England, and especially the electors of\r\n    Westminster, were made of sterner stuff. Whatever His Majesty’s\r\n    ministers may think proper to do, what course they may choose\r\n    to pursue, we have shown our determination to maintain and\r\n    support the English constitution and to resist to the uttermost\r\n    the dismemberment of the British empire, notwithstanding that\r\n    Mr. Daniel O’Connell is our declared and determined foe.\r\n    (Loud cheers, with shouts of disapprobation from the ‘Leader’\r\n    party.) In addition, I will merely say that you view as I do\r\n    the attempt to control your opinions lately made by the great\r\n    popish priest-ridden paid patriot of Ireland. (Great applause\r\n    and sensation.) And I will add this, that I wish such persons\r\n    would declare and destroy themselves as he has done; no danger\r\n    could then be apprehended, as I think it would be on all\r\n    occasions safer to have such persons my foes than my friends.\r\n    (Cheers, and yellings from the ‘Leader’ party.) Gentlemen, with\r\n    these observations I shall take my leave. The sun shines upon\r\n    our principles and our affections at this moment; but there is\r\n    a still brighter sunshine in every honest English heart at the\r\n    triumph achieved by you and the example you have set to the\r\n    rest of England. (Cheers.) Wishing you all good and happiness,\r\n    and full of the devotion I owe you electors of Westminster and\r\n    to the friends to the cause of England and the constitution,\r\n    I now take my leave. (Renewed cheering, which continued for\r\n    several minutes, during which time the hon. baronet bowed to\r\n    the meeting and retired from the hustings, accompanied as he\r\n    came, by a large body of his friends and supporters.)”\r\n\r\nThe situation of Mr. Leader was illustrated by a parody of Sir E.\r\nLandseer’s picture of “The Dog and the Shadow;” the bone is Bridgwater\r\n(which seat he relinquished to contest Westminster)--the latter is\r\ninscribed on the shadow.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the Westminster contest was given by HB as a “Race\r\nfor the Westminster Stakes between an Old Thoro’bred and a Young\r\nCock-tail--weight for age--the old ’un winning in a canter” (May 22,\r\n1837). Lord Russell, Wellington, and others are assembled as spectators\r\nin a booth to the right. Lord Castlereagh, the jockey, is bringing in\r\neasily the high-mettled racer with Burdett’s face. Roebuck is vainly\r\nwhipping and spurring “Leader,” the second horse. Hume and O’Connell\r\nare highly excited at the defeat of their favourite.\r\n\r\nThe question of a Repeal of the Union was one of a momentous order, and\r\naccordingly a considerable interest seems to have attended Burdett’s\r\nchange of sides. Doyle has given a capital version of the story in\r\n“Taking up a Fare. ‘All the World’s a Stage’” (May 24, 1837). The\r\ncoach represented is “Peel’s Stager;” Sir James Graham is ostler; Sir\r\nRobert Peel, as “whip,” is raising up his reins and addressing the box\r\npassenger, William IV., “We begin to load up capital well,” alluding\r\nto Burdett, the fresh customer. “You don’t say so,” remarks the king.\r\nPeel continues his reminiscences of the new inside passenger. “He as\r\nis now getting in--was formerly a great ally of the ‘Comet.’[74] He\r\nhas since travelled occasionally with the ‘Mazeppa’[75] people; but,\r\nfor some time back, I have missed him off the road entirely.” The Duke\r\nof Wellington, who is making everything secure, and Lord Lyndhurst\r\nare in the “boot.” Sir Francis Burdett, still lamed with the gout, is\r\nabout to enter the coach; the door is held for him by Lord Stanley: “I\r\nshould know your face: didn’t you once drive the ‘Darby Dilly?’ What\r\nare you doing now?” Lord Stanley (whom HB, in a former cartoon, had\r\ndrawn upsetting the “Darby Dilly” in question) is touching his hat to\r\nSir Francis, and replying, “At present, Sir, I’m with these people; but\r\nsince ‘the Dilly’ was done up I haven’t had no regular engagement. I\r\nsometimes drives the ‘Conservative’ up a stage and sometimes take it\r\ndown.” Lord Castlereagh appears as Burdett’s tiger.\r\n\r\nBurdett, the ex-Radical champion, still in his congenial character\r\nof “Don Quixote,” is next shown attacking the “Lion of Democracy.”\r\nThe picture of this adventure is entitled “The Last and Highest Point\r\nat which the Unheard-of Courage of Don Quixote ever did, or could\r\narrive, with the Happy Conclusion.” “An Old Song to a New Tune” (June\r\n17, 1837), shows the Whig wherry reduced to make great exertions to\r\nkeep ahead; of the six rowers, the faces of Palmerston, Duncannon,\r\nand Melbourne are alone shown; Lord John Russell is steering. The\r\npassengers are John Bull, with an uneasy expression, seated beside the\r\nking, who is evidently upset by the motion, and looks very unwell. The\r\nparody runs--\r\n\r\n    “Row, brothers, row,\r\n    The stream runs fast,\r\n    The Raddies[76] are near,\r\n    And our daylight’s past.”\r\n\r\nLeader’s fate over the Westminster contest (June 17, 1837) is summed\r\nup as “A Dead Horse--a Sorry Subject,--what was once a Leader in the\r\nBridgwater Coach; supposed to have been driven to Death by his Cruel\r\nMasters.” Hume is driving off the defeated in a knacker’s cart.\r\n\r\n“We, the People of England” (July 1837), exhibits Messrs. Hume,\r\nRoebuck, and Wakley as the “Three Tailors of Tooley Street,” all three\r\nsitting cross-legged; the former, slate in hand, is working out one of\r\nhis grand historic “tottles.”\r\n\r\nThe candidature of General Evans for Westminster is summed up as\r\n“Reorganizing the Legion” (24 July, 1837). The boardmen all appear\r\nin ragged regimentals, as the remnant of the Spanish Legion, and a\r\nvery woebegone set they seem; the fugleman, wearing a cocked hat, has\r\na pictorial placard of a leader taking to flight, with the legend,\r\n“I run;” the posters appear chiefly designed to canvass “Murray for\r\nWestminster;” and General Evans is himself trying to make the file\r\nstraight with his malacca cane, while crying, “Eyes right.”\r\n\r\nSir Francis Burdett had, in his altered politics, fought, conquered,\r\nand made his final bow at the hustings of Westminster, he being at the\r\ntime in indifferent health; his return for Wiltshire was the next point\r\nof interest. How far this change of constituency suited the baronet’s\r\nown constitution is displayed by HB, who had previously exhibited the\r\nsubject of his sportive humour under his gouty infirmity. “Grinding\r\nYoung” (July 25, 1837) is the title of a new application of an old\r\nfancy; Burdett, broken by age and debility, with his foot swathed in\r\nflannel, showing the gouty foe triumphant, is hobbling with a crutch up\r\nthe ladder which leads from “Westminster” to the wonderful mill; and,\r\npresto! an agriculturist turns the handle, and forth from the hopper\r\nemerges the baronet in his familiar guise, spick, span, and spruce,\r\nwith the elastic smartness and activity of youth, he is stepping out\r\ninto “North Wilts.”\r\n\r\nAn ingenious election skit appeared on Lord Durham’s appeal to the\r\nlocal constituency: it is entitled, “The Newest Universal Medicine”\r\n(July 27, 1837). Lord Durham appears as a compounder of quack nostrums;\r\nhe wears an apron, and is standing at a counter, stirring with a pestle\r\na mortar containing his novel mixture. Beneath it is his “Letter to\r\nthe Electors of Durham,” and around are the varied ingredients of his\r\n“Universal Panacea”--such as “Conservative Opiate,” “Radical Alcohol,”\r\nwith “Whig Alkali;” while all sorts of colours are ready to hand,\r\nindigo, and orange, light blue, mustard (Durham), and verdigris. While\r\nmixing his pills, Lord Durham is exclaiming “Now to extinguish that\r\nQuack Morison!” A large box stands ready for the medicament, addressed\r\nto “Daniel O’Connell, Esq., M.P., General Association and Trades-Union,\r\nDublin;” a smaller box is directed to the Bishop of Exeter. On a chair\r\nstands a small collection of the quack compounds and remedies in boxes\r\nof various hues, and addressed to the _Times_, _Standard_, _Globe_, and\r\n_Morning Chronicle_, indicative of Lord Durham’s versatile talents and\r\nscribbling propensities.\r\n\r\nA touching allegory for a rejected candidate was furnished by HB over\r\nthese same elections. “As You like It” (July 31, 1837). The wounded and\r\nsolitary deer which has come down to the brook, presents the lachrymose\r\ncountenance of Roebuck; the shaft which has caused his tears is marked\r\n“Bath.” Lord John Russell, as the “Melancholy Jacques,” is, from the\r\nother side of the water, soliloquizing over the Roebuck’s fate.\r\n\r\nDr. Bowring is favoured with a place in Doyle’s portrait-gallery, as\r\n“The Rejected of Kilmarnock” (August 21, 1837).\r\n\r\nAnother defeat at the general election forms food for HB’s playful\r\nirony. This time it is Joseph Hume rejected by Middlesex: “Figurative\r\nRepresentation of the Late Catastrophe” (August 31, 1837). The\r\nMiddlesex balloon is sailing majestically out of reach; the gentleman\r\nthrown out is descending at a fine pace; Joseph Hume’s parachute is\r\nblown inside out, and he is ejaculating in his fall, “Now, unless some\r\nfriendly dunghill receives me, I am lost for ever.” Below him are the\r\ngreen plains of Erin, and the spot on which the discomfited aeronaut is\r\ndescending is shown to be Kilkenny.\r\n\r\nDaniel O’Connell pretty generally seems the master of the situation in\r\nthe impressions we get of the big Liberator in Doyle’s admirable and\r\ngenially humorous cartoons. In another aspect of the 1837 election,\r\npublished at the same date, the great Dan is installed as passenger and\r\ntraffic manager at the metropolitan head-quarters of the new railway.\r\n“Great Western General Booking Office” (August 31st) shows those\r\ngentlemen who have been so unfortunate as to miss their seats besieging\r\nO’Connell for fresh places, “Gentlemen,” he cries, with good-natured\r\ndesire to assist all, “we are all full; but, if you will only wait for\r\nthe next train, we shall, I have no doubt, be able to accommodate you\r\nall with seats.” The best-known of the rejected ones are clamouring\r\nround the counter: “I am afraid we are thrown out for the present,”\r\nsays one; while Dr. Bowring “the rejected of Kilmarnock,” is of\r\nopinion, “It seems there is a screw loose somewhere in their principal\r\nengine.” Roebuck stands first of the unfortunates; his slight luggage\r\nis “at the end of his stick;” Hume, carpet-bag in hand, has secured a\r\nticket, and is departing--evidently with grave misgivings--to Kilkenny.\r\nEmerson Tennent and Sir James Graham are standing at the door of the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate reception of Hume by Kilkenny is set forth by the same\r\nhand: “Shooting Rubbish” (August 31, 1837). Dan O’Connell, habited as\r\nan Irish peasant, has brought Hume on a hay-trolley to a thatched cabin\r\nmarked “Kilkenny;” he is gently lowered on to a heap by the wayside,\r\nwhere, according to a notice-board, “Rubbish may be shot.” “I think,”\r\nsays Dan, “that is letting you down nice and easy.” Hume is grateful\r\nfor the opportune assistance: “Thank ye, friend; should you ever have\r\noccasion to come to the North, I’ll endeavour to do as much for you.”\r\n\r\nParliament was not summoned until November 15, 1837; in the interval,\r\nDoyle produced two or three ingenious cartoons summarizing the\r\nsituation. One of the best of these represents the field of contest\r\nlike the preceding versions; it is entitled, “Retzsch’s Extraordinary\r\nDesign of Satan playing at Chess with Man for his Soul, copied by HB\r\nin his freest manner” (September 29, 1837). The Great Dan takes the\r\nplace of the evil one, the skull and cross-bones are mounted as his\r\nensign, and he is evidently master of the board. “Man” is personated\r\nby Lord Melbourne, who is evidently in perplexity as to his next move.\r\nBritannia is personifying man’s good angel, and she is pitifully\r\nregarding the loser.\r\n\r\n“A Game at Chess (again): the Queen in Danger” is another version of\r\nthe situation in the recess. This appeared October 20, 1837, with the\r\nquotation, “A change came o’er the spirit of my dream.” The youthful\r\nsovereign is matched against Lord Palmerston. The Queen’s political\r\ntutor and adviser, Lord Melbourne, is standing behind the chair of\r\nhis royal mistress. Lord Palmerston has put the Queen in jeopardy;\r\nHer Majesty is evidently anxious, but fails to master the right move.\r\nMelbourne sees the situation, and looks on with some excitement, but is\r\nenjoined by Palmerston to refrain from prompting his royal pupil’s play.\r\n\r\nThis situation is further exemplified in two later cartoons: “Susannah\r\nand the Elders” (October 27, 1837), in which the Queen is riding\r\nbetween Lords Melbourne and Palmerston; the spot appears to be\r\nBrighton, near the Pavilion, then a royal residence. The other version\r\nis borrowed from the popular farce, “High Life below Stairs (inverted),\r\nas lately performed at Windsor by Her Majesty’s servants” (October 31,\r\n1837). The Queen is seen, seated on a sofa, but partly screened from\r\nview by a curtain. Lord Melbourne, who makes a handsome “my lord duke,”\r\nis monopolizing the youthful beauty; he observes to Lord Palmerston,\r\nwho is also in livery, with a cockade--“Stand off; you are a Commoner.\r\nNothing under nobility approaches Kitty.” Lord Palmerston is not\r\noverawed by these exclusive pretensions; as a representative of the\r\nCommons, he seizes his advantage,--“And what becomes of your dignity,\r\nif we refuse the supplies?”\r\n\r\nA pungent epitome of the incidents of electioneering is thus set forth\r\nby an anonymous poetaster:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ELECTION DAY-A SKETCH FROM NATURE.\r\n\r\n“THE HUSTINGS.\r\n\r\n    “Now, hail ye, groans, huzzas, and cheers,\r\n    So grateful to electors’ ears,\r\n    Where all is riot and confusion,\r\n    Fraud, friendship, scandal, and delusion;\r\n    Now houses stormed, and windows broken,\r\n    Serve as a pastime and a token\r\n    That patriots spare not, in their zeal,\r\n    Such measures for their country’s weal.\r\n    Now greeting, hooting, and abuse,\r\n    To each man’s party prove of use;\r\n    And mud, and stones, and waving hats,\r\n    And broken heads, and putrid cats,\r\n    Are offerings made to aid the cause\r\n    Of order, government, and laws.\r\n    Now lampoons, idle tales, and jokes,\r\n    And placards overreach and hoax;\r\n    While blustering, bullying, and brow-beating,\r\n    A little pommeling, and maltreating,\r\n    And elbowing, jostling, and cajoling,\r\n    And all the jockeyship of polling,\r\n    And deep manœuvre and duplicity,\r\n    Prove all elections fair and free;\r\n    While _Scandalum Magnatum’s_ puzzled,\r\n    And lawless libel raves unmuzzled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE CHAIRING.\r\n\r\n    “And now the members, by freeholders,\r\n    Are mounted on the rabble’s shoulders,\r\n    To typify, that willing backs\r\n    Are made for any sort of Tax,\r\n    And kindly sent, prepared by fate,\r\n    To bear the burthens of the State.\r\n    But that elections to the mob\r\n    Might prove a right good merry job,\r\n    Down from the waving laurel bower\r\n    Descends the glittering silver shower,\r\n    And, thus, with open-handed fee,\r\n    Meant as a check to bribery,\r\n    Each new-made Senator is willing,\r\n    By many a sixpence and a shilling,\r\n    To compromise for thumps and bruises,\r\n    For broken heads and bloody noses;\r\n    For damage done by sticks and stones,\r\n    For pockets picked, and broken bones.”\r\n\r\nOne of the best pictures of a country election is due to the muse of\r\nJohn Sterling; a few stanzas will not be found out of place:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE ELECTION.\r\n\r\n“A POEM IN SEVEN BOOKS.\r\n\r\n    “Cox represented Aleborough, patriot pure,\r\n    On whose tried firmness Europe leant secure,\r\n    But, woe to manufactures, land, and stocks!\r\n    Europe and Aleborough could not rescue Cox.\r\n    At London’s Mansion House, the Poultry’s pride,\r\n    Cox in his country’s service din’d and died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A new election! Glory to the town!\r\n    For all there’s profit, and for some renown.\r\n    ‘The Lion’ opes his hungry jaws, and springs;\r\n    And ‘The Black Bear’ seems dancing as he swings.\r\n      Before an hour the Patriot Blues are met;\r\n    Though Cox is gone, the Cause shall triumph yet,\r\n    The sacred cause of right; till it prevails,\r\n    The Universe hangs trembling in the scales.\r\n    ‘The Lion’ for the Blues! our flag’s unfurled,\r\n    And Mogg, instead of Cox, shall awe the world.\r\n      The big placard, with thunder in its look,\r\n    Glares like a page from Destiny’s own book;\r\n    The drums and trumpets hired augment their zeal\r\n    By strong potations till inspired they reel;\r\n    The chaises three, and omnibus immense,\r\n    Display ‘the Lion’s’ whole munificence;\r\n    And Mogg’s committee-men, a Spartan few,\r\n    To save the sinking State would die True Blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There Small, who plied dear Mistress Mogg with pills,\r\n    Prescribed her husband for a nations’ ills.\r\n    But chief of all amid that Senate wise,\r\n    Attorney Whisk had heard his country’s cries.“\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the “Red” candidate, Frank Vane, has providentially “dropped\r\ndown from the skies,” primarily for the benefit of the rival attorney\r\nSpark:--\r\n\r\n    “The Reds’ grave Nestor he, a man sedate\r\n    As ever filed a bill, or ruled a State.”\r\n\r\nA bargain for organizing opposition is arranged between these twain:--\r\n\r\n    “Ten minutes’ converse fixed the compact’s grounds,\r\n    And Frank engaged to pay twelve hundred pounds.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext comes the personal canvassing by Squire Mogg, and the purchase of\r\nvotes by direct flattery and indirect bribery:--\r\n\r\n    “From house to house Mogg’s well-fed body springs,\r\n    Helped by his patriot spirit’s ostrich wings,\r\n    With Whisk, and Small, and Snooks, a faithful few\r\n    Worth more than all a sultan’s retinue.\r\n    They point the path, the missing phrase supply,\r\n    Oft prompt a name, and hint with hand or eye,\r\n    Back each bold pledge, the fervid speech admire,\r\n    And still add fuel to their leader’s fire.”\r\n\r\nNow as to the bribery. After purchasing a superabundance of everything\r\nhe was likely to use (such as a hundredweight of soap), the candidate\r\nplunges into eccentricities recognized on these occasions:--\r\n\r\n    “By ready speech and vow, by flattery soft,\r\n    Sometimes by gifts, by promised favours oft,\r\n    He prospered well, and many a purchase made,\r\n    That helped at once the Cause and quickened Trade.\r\n      A stuffed jackdaw upon an upper shelf\r\n    Now caught his fancy, now a cup of delf;\r\n    He paid three pounds for each. A cat that tore\r\n    His fingers cost him ten, a rabbit more.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these oddities, besides fifteen old almanacks, white mice, and\r\nother worthless articles, were secured to enlist suffrages, and\r\npurchased at similarly extravagant rates; a familiar subterfuge for\r\nstultifying the Bribery Act:--\r\n\r\n    “A bishop’s worn-out wig, an infant’s caul,--\r\n    Were paid for down, and sent to Harrier Hall.”\r\n\r\n“The Rights of Women; or, a View of the Hustings with Female Suffrage,\r\n1853.” George Cruikshank, whose hand was turned to the illustration\r\nof nearly every event which occurred in his long career, had produced\r\nelection satires like his contemporaries at the beginning of the\r\ncentury. Later on, we find him turning his somewhat waning vigour\r\nto utilize the agitation for “Female Enfranchisement,” which, as a\r\nbranch of “Women’s Rights,” appears to have come before the public\r\nin 1852-3. A fanciful and farcical prospect of the hustings when lady\r\nvoters should rule the day presents the rival aspirants pictured as\r\n“The Ladies’ Candidate” and “The Gentlemen’s Candidate.” The latter\r\nis quite left to desolation. “Screw-driver, the Great Political\r\nEconomist,” beyond his boardmen, stands alone. Although a placard is\r\nmounted advising the electoral community not to vote for “Ignorant\r\npuppies,” the “Champion of the Fair” seems to have a lively time of it;\r\nCupid, or his representative, upholds the appeal, “Vote for Darling\r\nand Parliamentary Balls Once a Week;” the committee and supporters\r\nof Sir Charles are ladies, apparelled in the height of the fashions\r\nfor 1852. Behind the tigerish candidate for parliamentary honours\r\nis a group of melancholy troubadours, travestied much as Cruikshank\r\nand Thackeray used to depict those worthy guitar-strummers at the\r\nnow-obsolete “Beulah Spa.” Great unanimity prevails in the mob; not\r\nonly are the newly enfranchised fair ones giving their own votes, they\r\ngo farther, and coerce the sterner sex, for all the well-regulated\r\nmales are brought forward, under the influence of beauty, to record\r\ntheir votes for the chosen of the ladies. On the extreme left is\r\nseen one forlorn individual who has evidently lingering doubts of\r\nSir Charles’s programme, or an inclination to support the political\r\neconomist, “Ugly Old Stingy;” but his wife is forcibly arguing him\r\ninto an obedient frame of mind. The voters all carry bouquets and wear\r\nextensive favours. “Husband and Wife” voters are arrived first at the\r\npoll; and, following a mounted champion “in armour clad” with a heart\r\nfor his device, comes the last section of “Sweetheart Voters,” the\r\n“male things” docilely following the mistresses of their affections.\r\n“The Friends of Sir Charles Darling are Requested to Meet this Evening\r\nat the Assembly Rooms--the Hon. Mrs. Manley in the Chair. Tea and\r\nCoffee at 7 o’clock.” Even Cruikshank’s imagination had not risen to\r\nthe elevation of lady candidates for senatorial as well as electoral\r\nhonours, or he would doubtless have favoured the public with some\r\noriginal (pictorial) views on this question.\r\n\r\nThe general election which took place in July, 1857, found two famous\r\nmen in the annals of literature contesting for senatorial honours, when\r\nW. M. Thackeray and his friend James Hannay were hopefully canvassing,\r\non opposite political platforms, two constituencies, the former\r\nfor Oxford, the latter for Dumfries, which his father, the Scotch\r\nbanker, had unsuccessfully fought in the Conservative interest at the\r\nsuccessive general elections of 1832 and 1835.\r\n\r\nJames Hannay again discovered, in 1857, that the electors of Dumfries\r\nremained consistent to Whig principles. The novelist and essayist was\r\nbeaten at the hustings; but he has left something more characteristic\r\nthan the average of parliamentary orations in the delightful essay\r\nupon “Electioneering,” contributed to the _Quarterly Review_, with the\r\nwriting of which the defeated candidate immediately consoled himself\r\nfor his recent disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe canvassing rejoiced Hannay’s enthusiastic temperament. The\r\nvarieties of the genus voter are so infinite that his eye for character\r\nwas constantly studying original types; he discovered that the work\r\nis hard, and that the qualities a good canvasser must combine are as\r\nvarious as the dispositions he has to encounter.\r\n\r\n    “He must have unwearied activity, imperturbable good temper,\r\n    popular manners, and a wonderful memory. Every person who has\r\n    made a trial of electioneering can testify to the exhaustion\r\n    and fatigue of the first canvass, the swarm of new faces\r\n    seen and flitting through the mind in strange confusion, the\r\n    impossibility of distinguishing between the voter who had a\r\n    leaning to you, but doubted your fidelity to the Maynooth\r\n    Grant, and his next-door neighbour who was coming round to you\r\n    against his former prejudice, because of your freedom from\r\n    religious bigotry. The mental eye wearies of the kaleidoscope\r\n    that has been turning before it for hours. The hand aches with\r\n    incessant shaking. The head aches with incessant observation.\r\n    You fling yourself wearied at nightfall into an easy chair\r\n    in your committee-room, and plunge eagerly into sherry and\r\n    soda-water. You could lie down and sleep like a general after\r\n    a battle. But your committee is about to meet, as a staring\r\n    blue bill on the hotel wall informs the public; and a score of\r\n    people have news for you. Tomkins, the hatter, is wavering--a\r\n    man who can influence four or five; the enemy have set going a\r\n    story that you beat your wife, and you must have a placard out\r\n    showing that you are a bachelor. A gang are drinking champagne\r\n    at the Blue Boar (one of the enemy’s houses), fellows whose\r\n    potations are usually of the poorest kind; your opinion is\r\n    wanted on a new squib; the manager of the theatre is below,\r\n    waiting to see if you will patronize his theatre with an early\r\n    ‘bespeak night,’ and whether you will have ‘Black-Eyed Susan,’\r\n    or ‘Douglas;’ a deputation of proprietors of donkeys wants to\r\n    hear your views on the taxation of French asses’ milk. Who,\r\n    under such circumstances, can retain in his memory all the\r\n    details of the canvass of the day?”\r\n\r\nHowever galling the temporary disappointment experienced by Hannay and\r\nThackeray respectively, their readers had no reason to regret that, as\r\nthe great novelist wrote, philosophically accepting his defeat, “they\r\nwere sent back to take their places with their pens and ink at their\r\ndesks, and leave their successful opponents to a business which they\r\nunderstood better.” The test of tact and temper was certainly applied\r\nto the two novelists when competing for seats in the Commons.\r\n\r\nThackeray aspired to take the place in Parliament for the city of\r\nOxford which his friend Neate, at the time Professor of Political\r\nEconomy in that university, had lost for an alleged contravention of\r\nthe Corrupt Practices Act, thus described by Thackeray at the hustings:\r\n“He was found guilty of twopennyworth of bribery which he never\r\ncommitted.” This was Thackeray’s ostensible motive for his candidature:\r\n“A Parliament which has swallowed so many camels, strained at that\r\nlittle gnat, and my friend, your representative, the very best man you\r\ncould find to represent you, was turned back, and you were left without\r\na man. I cannot hope, I never thought, to equal him; I only came\r\nforward at a moment when I felt it necessary that some one professing\r\nhis principles, and possessing your confidence, should be ready to step\r\ninto the gap which he had made.”\r\n\r\nThe author of the electioneering squib directed for “Young Liberal\r\nGlory” as against “Old Tory Glory” in 1837, was, twenty years later,\r\nfound consistently advocating the Liberal principles which had inspired\r\nhis early writings in the _Constitutional_. Thackeray appeared as an\r\nadvocate of the ballot, was “for having people amused after they had\r\ndone their worship on a Sunday;” while, “as for triennial Parliaments,\r\nif the constituents desire them, I am for them.”\r\n\r\nThe following passages from his address enlightened the electors of\r\nOxford upon Thackeray’s political convictions:--\r\n\r\n    “I would use my best endeavours not merely to enlarge the\r\n    constituencies, but to popularize the Government of this\r\n    country. With no feeling but that of goodwill towards those\r\n    leading aristocratic families who are administering the chief\r\n    offices of the State, I believe it could be benefited by the\r\n    skill and talent of persons less aristocratic, and that the\r\n    country thinks so likewise.... The usefulness of a member of\r\n    Parliament is best tested at home; and should you think fit to\r\n    elect me as your representative, I promise to use my utmost\r\n    endeavour to increase and advance the social happiness, the\r\n    knowledge, and the power of the people.”\r\n\r\nOne point in his speech at the hustings, a characteristic allusion to\r\nthe paramount influence of the Marlborough dukes, for many generations\r\nmasters of the Oxford elections, was in the true Titmarshian vein,\r\nand worthy of the occasion:--“I hear that not long since--in the\r\nmemory of many now alive--this independent city was patronized by a\r\ngreat university, and that a great duke, who lived not very far from\r\nhere, at the time of the election used to put on his boots, and ride\r\ndown and order the freemen of Oxford to elect a member for him.” By a\r\ncurious coincidence, not altogether reassuring, Thackeray’s reputation\r\nat Oxford had somehow failed to reach the majority with whom he was\r\nthrown into contact, as one of his committee-men has assured the\r\nwriter. They mainly asserted that “he could not speak,” to which the\r\ncandidate retorted “he knew that, but he could write.” Unaccountable as\r\nit appears, the fame of his writings had not, in those days, penetrated\r\nto any extent this short distance, as the novelist learned by direct\r\nand disenchanting experience. He said, in his valedictory remarks,\r\n“Perhaps I thought my name was better known than it is.” This illusion,\r\nnatural in itself, ought to have been dispelled by a former revelation\r\nof unsuspected ignorance, which, though unflattering to the author,\r\nhad, as related by the sufferer, its ludicrous side. Thackeray had\r\nbetaken himself to Oxford on a previous occasion, with the intention\r\nof addressing his lectures on “The English Humorists” to the rising\r\nyouth at Alma Mater, and, as it was necessary to obtain the licence of\r\nthe university authorities, he waited upon the chancellor’s resident\r\ndeputy, who received him blandly.\r\n\r\n    “Pray, what can I do to serve you, sir?” inquired the\r\n    functionary. “My name is Thackeray.” “So I see by this card.”\r\n    “I seek permission to lecture within the precincts.” “Ah! you\r\n    are a lecturer. What subjects do you undertake--religious or\r\n    political?” “Neither; I am a literary man.” “Have you written\r\n    anything?” “Yes; I am the author of ‘Vanity Fair.’” “I presume\r\n    a Dissenter. Has that anything to do with John Bunyan’s book?”\r\n    “Not exactly. I have also written ‘Pendennis.’” “Never heard of\r\n    those works; but no doubt they are proper books.” “I have also\r\n    contributed to _Punch_.” “_Punch!_ I have heard of that. Is it\r\n    not a ribald publication?”\r\n\r\nOn his reception in Oxford in the character of a canvasser, Thackeray\r\naddressed the electors with sturdy independence, beyond electioneering\r\npersuasive beguilements:--“You know whether I have acted honestly\r\ntowards you; and you on the other side will say whether I ever\r\nsolicited a vote when I knew that vote was promised to my opponent; or\r\nwhether I have not always said, ‘Sir, keep your word. Here is my hand\r\non it. Let us part good friends.’” Although beaten by the Right Hon.\r\nEdward Cardwell, Thackeray retained his good humour, energetically\r\nenjoining the extension of courtesy to his successful opponent and to\r\nthe opposition party. A cry of “Bribery” being raised against them,\r\nhe continued: “Don’t cry out bribery. If you know of it, prove it;\r\nbut, as I am innocent of bribery myself, I do not choose to fancy that\r\nother men are not equally loyal and honest.” He attributed his defeat\r\nto the advanced views he avowed--and which, as he asserted, “he would\r\nnot blink to be made a duke or a marquis to-morrow”--on the question\r\nof “allowing a man to have harmless pleasures when he had done his\r\nworship on Sundays. I expected to have a hiss, but they have taken a\r\nmore dangerous shape--the shape of slander. Those gentlemen who will\r\ntake the trouble to read my books--and I should be glad to have as\r\nmany of you for subscribers as will come forward--will be able to say\r\nwhether there is anything in them that should not be read by any one’s\r\nchildren, or my own, or by any Christian man.”\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic anecdote which has survived of this interesting\r\nincident in Thackeray’s experience as an “electioneerer,” exhibits\r\nhim in a thoroughly John Bull attitude. While looking out of the\r\nhotel window, amused at the humours of the scene, in which he was\r\nonly the second performer, a passing crowd, from hooting, proceeded\r\nto rough-handling, and the supporters of Mr. Cardwell, being in the\r\nminority against their assailants, would have been badly maltreated,\r\nbut for Thackeray’s starting up in the greatest possible excitement,\r\nand, rushing downstairs, notwithstanding the efforts to detain him\r\nof more hardened electioneers, who evidently were of opinion that a\r\ntrifling correction of the opposite party might be beneficial _pour\r\nencourager les autres_; he was not to be deterred, but, expressing\r\nin strong language his opinion of such unmanly behaviour, he hurled\r\nhimself into the thick of the fray; and, awful spectacle for his party!\r\nhis tall form--Thackeray, be it remembered, stood upwards of 6ft.\r\n2in.--was next seen towering above the crowd, dealing about him right\r\nand left with frantic energy in defence of his opponent’s partisans and\r\nin defiance of his own friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF BRIBERY AT ELECTIONS.--BRIBERY ACTS.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, an important Act was passed consolidating and amending\r\nprevious Acts relating to this offence, from 7 Will. 3 (1695) to 5 and\r\n6 Vict. c. 184.\r\n\r\n  Messrs.

B.M.)\r\n\r\n[3] 1431. “So there is owing to them for their appearance for 73 days\r\n6_s._ and 8_d._ for each day” (_i.e._ for _two_ members).\r\n\r\n1441-2.--“And it was the same day ordered by assent of the whole\r\ncongregation that the Burgesses chosen for Parliament shall be allowed\r\neach of them two shillings a day, and by no means any more.” (Extracts\r\nfrom the Proceedings of the Corporation of Lynn Regis, 1430 to 1731.\r\n_Archæologia_, vol. xxiv.)\r\n\r\n[4] William Prynne was one of the great authorities upon parliamentary\r\nhistory and statistics. All subsequent compilers, who have written upon\r\nthe subject of constituencies, quoted from his “Brevia Parliamentaria\r\nRediviva.”\r\n\r\n[5] Andrew Marvell, who was made assistant-secretary to Milton, when\r\nhe served the Protector, was, by Cromwell’s death, thrown out of\r\nemployment. The burgesses of Hull, with whom he was deservedly popular,\r\nelected Marvell their representative to Parliament. The payment, of\r\nwhich so much has been made, for these services did not amount to a\r\nmunificent retainer, the salary being fixed at two shillings a day for\r\nborough members; kindly remembrances in the form of acceptable gifts\r\nwere, however, sent by constituents to those representatives who won\r\ntheir good wishes. Thus Marvell writes to the friends who sent him to\r\nparliament: “We must first give you thanks for the kind present you\r\nhave pleased to send us, which will give occasion to us to remember\r\nyou often; but the quantity is so great, that it might make sober men\r\nforgetful.”\r\n\r\n[6] Coleridge, “Northern Worthies.”\r\n\r\n[7] Campbell, “Lives of the Lord Chancellors.”\r\n\r\n[8] “DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM’S LITANY.\r\n\r\n    “From cringing to those we scorn and contemn\r\n    In hopes to be made the citizens’ Gem,\r\n    Who now scorn us more than we e’er did them,\r\n                                            _Libera nos Domine_.\r\n\r\n    “From beginning an Execrable Trait’rous health,\r\n    To destroy the Parliament, King, and himself,\r\n    To be made Ducal Peer of a new Commonwealth,\r\n                                            _Libera nos Domine_.\r\n\r\n    “From changing old Friends for rascally new ones;\r\n    From taking Wildman and Marvell for true ones;\r\n    From wearing Green Ribbons ’gainst him gave us Blue ones,\r\n                                            _Libera nos Domine_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n    “Here’s a Health to the King, and his lawful successors,\r\n      To honest _Tantivies_, and Loyal _Addressors_;\r\n    But a rot take all those that promoted _Petitions_,\r\n      To poison their nation, and stir up seditions.”\r\n\r\n    (_The Loyal Health_, 1684.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] “The _Petitioners_, looking upon their adversaries as entirely\r\ndevoted to the Court and the popish faction, gave them the name\r\nof _Tories_, a title given to the Irish robbers, villains, and\r\ncut-throats, since called _Rapparees_. (It will be remembered that\r\nJames II. convened a Parliament in Dublin which attainted three\r\nthousand Protestants).\r\n\r\n“The _Abhorrers_ on their side, considering the _Petitioners_ as men\r\nentirely in the principles of the reprobated parliament of 1640, and as\r\nPresbyterians, gave them the name of _Whig_, or ‘Sour-milk,’ formerly\r\nappropriated to the Scotch Presbyterians and rigid Covenanters.”\r\n\r\n[11] A second _Convention_ Parliament met January 22, 1689, offered the\r\nCrown to William of Orange and Mary, February 13th, and dissolved a\r\nyear later.\r\n\r\n[12] Published by the “Ballad Society.”\r\n\r\n[13] Alleged length of the petition for resummoning parliament.\r\n\r\n[14] This relates to Lord Shaftesbury’s Protestant Association, and his\r\n“green ribbon boys.”\r\n\r\n[15] H.

He said that “he was the head of the Government,\r\nand the only judge of what was fit to be done in such cases, and that\r\nhe would do that which he thought most for the good of himself and his\r\npeople, desiring that they would not meddle with a matter that was so\r\nessential a part of his prerogative.” This brazen-faced assumption is\r\nso coloured by Carolian waggery, that we must fancy the Merry Monarch,\r\nif he saw the wit of his speech, making the reply in question with his\r\n“tongue in his cheek.”\r\n\r\n[21] Sir Thomas Mompesson had sat in the parliament in 1679 for New\r\nSarum, and in the Oxford Parliament he sat for Old Sarum.\r\n\r\n[22] “The Presbyters.”\r\n\r\n[23] Thomas Thynne, whose estate was £9000 a year. He was an invaluable\r\nally of the Duke of Monmouth. Assassinated by hired bravoes in the pay\r\nof Count Königsmarck, who was in love with the rich heiress, a widow,\r\nto whom poor Thynne was (by the influence of her friends) betrothed, be\r\nit said, against the inclination of the lady herself.\r\n\r\n[24] The celebrated Philippe de Comines (1445-1509). “L’on voit dans\r\nComines, mieux que partout ailleurs, ce qu’étaient alors et les droits\r\ndes rois et les privilèges des peuples. Il témoigne pour les Anglais,\r\nqui déjà savaient mieux que tout autre nation maintenir leurs libertés,\r\nune grande consideration.”\r\n\r\n[25] Frank Smith and Benjamin Harris, publishers of many tracts,\r\nsatires, and so-called “libels” against the Court.\r\n\r\n[26] _Commons Journals_, March 26, 1681.\r\n\r\n[27] Lord Keeper and Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[28] The scapegoat, Fitz-Harris, who was promptly got rid of, for fear\r\nof revelations, being executed June 9, 1681.\r\n\r\n[29] That the Lords contested the claim of the Commons to impeach and\r\ncondemn any one whom they might accuse of a crime was a grievance of\r\nthe Lower House.\r\n\r\n[30] Mr. Samuel Lewen.\r\n\r\n[31] His seat was Long Ditton, near Kingston, which town had\r\nsurrendered its charter to King Charles II. about a month before\r\nhis death. King James appointed Sir Edward Evelyn one of the new\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n[32] A Child was subsequently successful in getting returned for\r\nMiddlesex. Child died in 1740, and was succeeded by Hugh Smithson, who\r\nlater became known as the recipient of the honours of the Dukes of\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\n[33] The term “Tacker” was due to the chief member for Oxford\r\nUniversity, William Bromley, having, in the session just closed, moved\r\n“That the Bill to prevent occasional nonconformity might be _tacked_\r\nto the Land Tax Bill.” The practice of tacking was condemned by the\r\nLords, most of whom had signed a resolution to the effect they would\r\nnever admit a “tack” to a money-bill. The party in the Commons strove\r\nvigorously to carry their point upon two bills being thus conjoined,\r\nwhence they began to be known as “the Tackers.” In return, they\r\nstigmatized their opponents as “Sneakers.”\r\n\r\n[34] Tacks, otherwise Tackers, _i.e._ High-Church Tories, who were\r\nfirst so called from their efforts to tack the Occasional Conformity\r\nBill on to a money bill, so that it could not be sent back by the Lords.\r\n\r\n[35] Jacobites.\r\n\r\n[36] “Memoirs of the Life of Thomas, Marquess of Wharton; to which is\r\nadded his character by Sir Richard Steele.” London, 1715. 8vo.\r\n\r\n[37] Lord Grimston’s curious comedy, in five acts and in verse(!), “The\r\nLawyer’s Fortune, or Love in a Hollow Tree,” was first published in\r\n1704, as a quarto; being a foolish attempt, in fact, the merest trash,\r\nthe author, it is said, suppressed it. The edition printed, as alleged,\r\nby the Duchess of Marlborough’s orders, is dated 1736. Besides the\r\nheading of an elephant performing on a rope, a satirical frontispiece\r\nwas engraved, in which Lord Grimston is seen interrogating a sage,\r\nensconced in the “hollow tree” of his play; a jackass is the most\r\nconspicuous object in the foreground; the animal wears a coronet, and\r\nis intended to typify the doltish author, who is farther ridiculed in a\r\nburlesque dedication “To the Right Sensible the Lord Flame.”\r\n\r\n[38] Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n[39] The Sacheverell riots.\r\n\r\n[40] “Catalogue of the Political and Personal Satires in the British\r\nMuseum,” vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[41] “The Humours of an Election” seems to have inspired not only\r\nartists and balladists, but playwrights and opera composers also. “The\r\nHumours of the Town, a Dramatic Interlude,” referring to the contested\r\nelection of 1774, is of this order. M.P. Andrews wrote “a new musical\r\nInterlude” under this title, 1774. “The Election,” a comedy in three\r\nacts, appeared in 1749; and “a new opera, called the Election,” was\r\npublished in 1817. “The Country Election,” a farce in two acts, is due\r\nto D. J. Trusler, 1786; and “The Humours of an Election,” by F. Pilon,\r\nwas published in 1780. Besides these and other plays, several poems\r\nwere printed under this title, to some of which we have occasion to\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\n[42] There were several variorum editions of this ballad, mostly\r\namounting in substance to the same thing, “but with differences.” One\r\nentitled, “The Downfall of Sundon and Wager,” etc., commences with this\r\nverse:--\r\n\r\n        “Ye Westminster Boys,\r\n        By your freedom of choice\r\n    Who have shown to your good friends of London\r\n        Ye dare to be free,\r\n        Reject Pension and Fee,\r\n    By throwing out Wager and Sundon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[43] “Gentleman Harry” was Henry Pelham, the head of the\r\nAdministration. He combined the offices of first lord of the treasury\r\nand chancellor of the exchequer. His death occurred on the eve of the\r\nelections of 1754.\r\n\r\n[44] Sir John Soane secured these inimitable pictures from Mrs. Garrick.\r\n\r\n[45] Hogarth, in the first state of the engraving, has made the\r\nsuperscription in the youthful candidate’s letter to be Sir Commodity\r\nTaxem, Bart. Nichols is not correct in describing this gentleman\r\nas Thomas Potter. Lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood were the Whig\r\ncandidates; the Tory representatives were Lord Parker and Sir E. Turner.\r\n\r\n[46] In the original painting it is, “the Devil.”\r\n\r\n[47] Dr. Shebbeare, in his “6th Letter to the People of England,”\r\naudaciously abused the reigning dynasty, for which Lord Mansfield\r\ncondemned him to stand in the pillory, to be imprisoned for three\r\nyears, etc. Subsequently Lord Bute complimented him with a pension,\r\nwhich Shebbeare enjoyed to his death.\r\n\r\n[48] Marked “New Interest” in the original painting, which is\r\nnecessarily easier to decipher than the engraving.\r\n\r\n[49] As concerned Churchill and the artist, they both departed, it may\r\nbe said, “warring to the very verge of the grave,” in 1764. Less than a\r\nmonth before the painter’s death appeared Churchill’s familiar lines,\r\ntreating his antagonist as already slain by his satire:--\r\n\r\n    “Hogarth would draw him (Envy must allow)\r\n    E’en to the life, was HOGARTH LIVING NOW.”\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, five weeks after these lines appeared, the poet\r\nwas likewise gathered to those shades to which he had with sportive\r\nvenom prematurely consigned his antagonist, in all probability without\r\nanticipating the literal fulfilment of his prophecy.\r\n\r\n[50] John Wilkes, Radical, 1290; George Cooke, Conservative, 827; Sir\r\nW. B. Proctor, the unsuccessful Whig candidate, polled 807 votes.\r\n\r\n[51] A less dignified view is taken of the lord mayor’s officious\r\nintervention, in the _Political Register_, 1768, where it states\r\nhe had degraded, by his personal interference, “the dignity of his\r\noffice to that of a petty constable;” and in a letter referring to the\r\nroyal and ministerial favours conferred in return “for his active and\r\nspirited behaviour,” the new state official is, in his capacity of\r\nmerchant-tailor, thus addressed:--\r\n\r\n“And now, my lord, as we are _brother tailors_, how could you be so\r\nunkind as not to join _eight of us_ to your right honourable self (nine\r\ntailors proverbially making one man), when you were dubbed the other\r\nday a Privy Councillor.”\r\n\r\n[52] The “cornuted” effect of these peculiarly fashioned wigs,\r\nespecially when seen from the back, is, perhaps, accountable--with the\r\npun on the parson’s Christian name of Horne--for the quotation engraved\r\nabove the plate in question,--“Mine horn shall be exalted, like the\r\nhorn of an Unicorn (_Psalm 93_).”\r\n\r\n[53] The Duke of Grafton was first lord of the treasury, 1767 to 1780.\r\n\r\n[54] John Wilkes.\r\n\r\n[55] George Fletcher, executed 1746.\r\n\r\n[56] Samuel Turner and Sir Robert Ladbrooke were unstable, and a few\r\nmonths later, “ratted” and becoming subservient to Court influence, did\r\ntheir best to betray the liberties of the citizens confided to their\r\nchampionship.\r\n\r\n[57] A mark being equivalent to 13_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n[58] According to the return of 1826 there were three hundred voters.\r\n\r\n[59] Sheridan, according to Lord Byron’s dictum, had produced the\r\nthree best compositions of his age in their respective lines: the best\r\ncomedy, “The School for Scandal;” the best parliamentary philippic,\r\nthe “Begum speech” against Warren Hastings; and pronounced the finest\r\nfuneral oration, the monody on Garrick.\r\n\r\n    “The pride of the palace, the bower, and the hall,\r\n      The orator, dramatist, minstrel who ran\r\n    Through each mode of the lyre and was master of all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[60] A necessary qualification, members being, by supposition, expected\r\nto reside in the places they represented.\r\n\r\n[61] Wilkes’s Address to the Middlesex Electors.\r\n\r\n[62] Lord Thurlow, who was frequently twitted by the satirists upon his\r\n_penchant_ for the fair sex.\r\n\r\n[63] Lord Bute’s secretary, the great dispenser of “back-stairs\r\ninfluence,” afterwards Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[64] For the screen of Carlton House Palace, see “Coriolanus addressing\r\nthe Plebeians,” 1820; p. 338.\r\n\r\n[65] The bard of the “New Chevy Chase,” being truly national, makes the\r\ndescendant of the Russells and his other personages express themselves\r\nvernacularly in “Scotticisms” when under the influence of strong\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n[66] The bishop.\r\n\r\n[67] “Charles Dix,” lately driven from France.\r\n\r\n[68] Whose ministry caused the Bourbon downfall.\r\n\r\n[69] Much as Gillray made his royal father scrutinizing and blinking at\r\nthe presentment of Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\n[70] Mr. J. Calcraft (W) succeeded in distancing Henry Bankes (W), but\r\nonly lived a few months to enjoy his victory; a fresh election took\r\nplace in October, 1831, _vice_ Calcraft deceased, when Lord Ashley\r\n(afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) secured the vacant seat.\r\n\r\n[71] Hobhouse was rejected by his Westminster constituents.\r\n\r\n[72] This is a reprehensible pun, barely to be tolerated even on\r\nsuch occasions, upon the name of Sir John Elley (C), an unsuccessful\r\ncandidate, who was beaten by eight votes: Sir J. de Beauvoir (W), the\r\nsecond member, polling 239 to Elley’s 231. John Ramsbottom (W), was\r\nreturned for Windsor at the top of the poll at the general elections of\r\n1832, 1835, and 1837.\r\n\r\n[73] Sir John de Beauvoir.\r\n\r\n[74] _i.e._ Napoleon Buonaparte.\r\n\r\n[75] See “Reform,” page 372.\r\n\r\n[76] “Radicals” for “rapids.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.",
