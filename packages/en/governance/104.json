This is preeminently the time to speak\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from\r\nhonestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will\r\nendure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of\r\nall, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear\r\nis fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which\r\nparalyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark\r\nhour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has\r\nmet with that understanding and support of the people themselves which\r\nis essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give\r\nthat support to leadership in these critical days.\r\n\r\nIn such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common\r\ndifficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values\r\nhave shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay\r\nhas fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of\r\nincome; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the\r\nwithered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers\r\nfind no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in\r\nthousands of families are gone.\r\n\r\nMore important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of\r\nexistence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a\r\nfoolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.\r\n\r\nAnd yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are\r\nstricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our\r\nforefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we\r\nhave still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and\r\nhuman efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a\r\ngenerous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.\r\nPrimarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods\r\nhave failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence,\r\nhave admitted their failure and have abdicated. Practices of the\r\nunscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public\r\nopinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.\r\n\r\nTrue they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern\r\nof an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed\r\nonly the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which\r\nto induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have\r\nresorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence.\r\nThey only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no\r\nvision, and when there is no vision the people perish.\r\n\r\nYes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple\r\nof our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient\r\ntruths. The measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we\r\napply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.\r\n\r\nHappiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy\r\nof achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral\r\nstimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of\r\nevanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they\r\ncost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered\r\nunto but to minister to ourselves—to our fellow men.\r\n\r\nRecognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of\r\nsuccess goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that\r\npublic office and high political position are to be valued only by the\r\nstandards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an\r\nend to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given\r\nto a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small\r\nwonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on\r\nhonor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, and on\r\nunselfish performance; without them it cannot live.\r\n\r\nRestoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This\r\nNation is asking for action, and action now.\r\n\r\nOur greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no\r\nunsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be\r\naccomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself,\r\ntreating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the\r\nsame time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed\r\nprojects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the overbalance of\r\npopulation in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national\r\nscale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land\r\nfor those best fitted for the land. Yes, the task can be helped by\r\ndefinite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with\r\nthis the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped\r\nby preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through\r\nforeclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by\r\ninsistence that the Federal, the State, and the local governments act\r\nforthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can\r\nbe helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often\r\nscattered, uneconomical, unequal. It can be helped by national planning\r\nfor and supervision of all forms of transportation and of\r\ncommunications and other utilities that have a definitely public\r\ncharacter. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can\r\nnever be helped by merely talking about it. We must act; we must act\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work we require\r\ntwo safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order; there\r\nmust be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and\r\ninvestments; there must be an end to speculation with other people’s\r\nmoney, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\r\n\r\nThese, my friends, are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge\r\nupon a new Congress, in special session, detailed measures for their\r\nfulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the\r\nforty-eight States.\r\n\r\nThrough this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own\r\nnational house in order and making income balance outgo. Our\r\ninternational trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of\r\ntime and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national\r\neconomy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things\r\nfirst. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international\r\neconomic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe basic thought that guides these specific means of national\r\nrecovery is not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a\r\nfirst consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements\r\nin and parts of the United States of America—a recognition of the old\r\nand permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the\r\npioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the\r\nstrongest assurance that recovery will endure.\r\n\r\nIn the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the\r\npolicy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects\r\nhimself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others—the\r\nneighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his\r\nagreements in and with a world of neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we\r\nhave never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we\r\ncannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go\r\nforward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice\r\nfor the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no\r\nprogress can be made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know,\r\nready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such\r\ndiscipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the\r\nlarger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes\r\nwill bind upon us—bind upon us all—as a sacred obligation with a\r\nunity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife.\r\n\r\nWith this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this\r\ngreat army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our\r\ncommon problems.\r\n\r\nAction in this image—action to this end—is feasible under the form\r\nof government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our\r\nConstitution is so simple, so practical that it is possible always to\r\nmeet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without\r\nloss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has\r\nproved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern\r\nworld has ever seen. It has met every stress of vast expansion of\r\nterritory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and\r\nlegislative authority may be wholly equal—wholly adequate—to meet the\r\nunprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented\r\ndemand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure\r\nfrom that normal balance of public procedure.\r\n\r\nI am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures\r\nthat a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require.\r\nThese measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of\r\nits experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional\r\nauthority, to bring to speedy adoption.\r\n\r\nBut in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two\r\ncourses, in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I\r\nshall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I\r\nshall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the\r\ncrisis—broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as\r\ngreat as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded\r\nby a foreign foe.\r\n\r\nFor the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion\r\nthat befit the time. I can do no less.\r\n\r\nWe face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of\r\nnational unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and\r\nprecious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the\r\nstern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the\r\nassurance of a rounded—a permanent—national life.\r\n\r\nWe do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of\r\nthe United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a\r\nmandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for\r\ndiscipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the\r\npresent instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.\r\n\r\nIn this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May\r\nHe protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to\r\ncome.",
