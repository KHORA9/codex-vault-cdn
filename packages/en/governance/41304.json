To the latter it must consequently prove a source of\r\nnever-failing interest. That it does so is clearly shown by the long\r\nlist of writers who have sought and found inspiration in the subject.\r\nTo add to their number may perhaps seem an unnecessary, even a\r\nsuperfluous, task. This volume may indeed be likened to that \"Old\r\nPiece in a New Dress\" to which Petyt compared his _Lex Parliamentaria_.\r\n\"These things, men will say, have been done before; the same Matter,\r\nand much the same Form, are to be found in other Writers, and this is\r\nbut to obtrude upon the World a vain Repetition of other men's\r\nobservations.\" But although the frank use of secondhand matter cannot\r\nin this case be denied, it is to be hoped that even the oldest and\r\nmost threadbare material may be woven into a fresh pattern, suitable\r\nto modern taste.\r\n\r\nIn these democratic days a seat in either House of Parliament is no\r\nlonger the monopoly of a single privileged class: it lies within the\r\nreach of all who can afford the luxury of representing either\r\nthemselves or their fellows at Westminster. It is therefore only\r\nnatural that the interest in parliamentary affairs should be more\r\nwidely disseminated to-day than ever. It does not confine itself to\r\nactual or potential members of both Houses, but is to be found in the\r\nbosom of the humblest constituent, and even of that shadowy individual\r\nvaguely referred to as the Man in the Street. Though, however, the\r\ninterest in Parliament is widespread, a knowledge of parliamentary\r\nforms, of the actual conduct of business in either House, of the\r\nworking of the parliamentary machine, is less universal.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the sources of information open to the student of\r\nparliamentary history may roughly be regarded as twofold. For the\r\nearnest scholar, desirous of examining the basis and groundwork of the\r\nConstitution, the birth and growth of Parliament, the gradual\r\nextension and development of its power, its privileges and procedure,\r\nthe writings of all the great English historians, and of such\r\nparliamentary experts as Hatsell, May, Palgrave, Sir William Anson,\r\nSir Courtenay Ilbert and Professor Redlich, provide a rich mine of\r\ninformation. That more considerable section of the reading public\r\nwhich seeks to be entertained rather than instructed, can have its\r\nneeds supplied by less technical but no less able parliamentary\r\nwriters--Sir Henry W. Lucy, Mr. T. P. O'Connor, Mr. MacDonagh--none of\r\nwhom, as a rule, attempts to do more than touch lightly upon\r\nfundamental Constitutional questions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of combining instruction with amusement is one from which\r\nevery normal-minded being naturally shrinks: the attempt generally\r\nresults in the failure either to inform or entertain. There does,\r\nhowever, seem to be room for a volume on the subject of Parliament\r\nwhich shall be sufficiently instructive to appeal to the student, and\r\nyet not so technical as to alarm or repel the general reader. It is\r\nwith the object of supplying the need for such a book that the\r\nfollowing pages have been written.\r\n\r\nAn endeavour to satisfy the tastes of every class of reader and at the\r\nsame time to cover the whole field of parliamentary history within the\r\nlimits of a single volume, must necessarily lead to many errors of\r\nadmission as well as of omission. The material at the disposal of the\r\nauthor is so vast, and the difficulties of rejection and selection are\r\nequally formidable. Much of the information given must perforce be so\r\nfamiliar as to appear almost hackneyed. Many of the stories with which\r\nthese pages are sprinkled bear upon them the imprint of extreme old\r\nage; they are grey with the cobwebs of antiquity. But while the\r\nepigram of the past is too often the commonplace of the present, the\r\nwitty anecdote of one generation, which seems to another to plumb the\r\nuttermost abysses of fatuity, may yet survive to be considered a\r\nbrilliant example of humour by a third. The reader, therefore, who\r\nrecognises old favourites scattered here and there about the\r\nletterpress, will deride or tolerate them in accordance with the\r\nrespect or contempt that he entertains for the antique.\r\n\r\nI cannot lay claim to the possession of expert parliamentary\r\nknowledge, though perhaps, after close upon fifteen years' residence\r\nwithin the precincts of the Palace of Westminster, I may have acquired\r\na certain intimacy with the life and habits of the Mother of\r\nParliaments. For my facts I have to a great extent relied upon the\r\nresearches of numerous parliamentary writers, past and present, to\r\nwhom I have endeavoured to express my indebtedness, not only in\r\ncopious footnotes, but also in the complete list of all sources of\r\ninformation given at the end of this volume. I wish to express my\r\nthanks to the many friends and acquaintances who have so kindly\r\nassisted me with their counsel and encouragement; to Mr. Kenyon, Mr.\r\nSidney Colvin and the officials of the Print Room and Reading Room at\r\nthe British Museum; to Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty, Garter King-at-Arms; to\r\nMr. Edmund Gosse, Librarian of the House of Lords, and other officers\r\nof both Houses. My thanks are particularly due to Sir Henry Graham,\r\nClerk of the Parliaments, who placed his unique parliamentary\r\nexperience at my disposal, and whose invaluable advice and assistance\r\nhave so greatly tended to lighten and facilitate my literary labours.\r\n\r\n  H.

If that be true, there is little\r\ndoubt that the social conditions of England should compare most\r\nfavourably with those of sister nations. But the admirable form of\r\nGovernment to which Englishmen have now long been accustomed, did not\r\ncome into existence in the course of a single night. \"The resemblance\r\nbetween the present Constitution and that from which it originally\r\nsprang,\" says an eighteenth-century writer, \"is not much nearer than\r\nthat between the most beautiful fly and the abject worm from which it\r\narose.\"[1] And the conversion of the chrysalis into the butterfly has\r\nbeen a slow and troublesome process.\r\n\r\n  [1] King's \"Essay on the English Constitution,\" p. 17.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu, who was an earnest student of the English Constitution,\r\nafter reading the treatise of Tacitus on the manners of the early\r\nGermans, declared that it was from them that England had borrowed her\r\nidea of political government. Whether or no this \"beautiful system was\r\nfirst invented in the woods,\"[2] as he says, it is certain that we owe\r\nthe primary principles of our existing constitution to German\r\nsources. They date back to the earliest days of the first settlements\r\nof Teutons on the Kentish shores.\r\n\r\n  [2] \"The Spirit of Laws.\" \"Works,\" vol. i. p. 212.\r\n\r\nTo the word \"parliament\" many derivations have been assigned. Petyt\r\nexplains the name as suggesting that every member of the assembly\r\nwhich it designates should _parler le ment_ or speak his mind.[3]\r\nAnother authority derives it from two Celtic words, signifying to\r\n\"speak abundantly\"--a meaning which is more applicable in these\r\ngarrulous times than it was in days when debate was often punctuated\r\nby lengthy intervals of complete silence.\r\n\r\n  [3] \"Lex Parliamentaria\" (1690), p. 1.\r\n\r\nWhatever its derivation, the word no doubt referred originally to the\r\n\"deep speech\" which the kings of old held with their councillors. The\r\nfirst mention of it, in connexion with a national assembly, occurs in\r\n1246, when it was used by Matthew Prior of a general convocation of\r\nEnglish barons. About thirty years later it appears again in the\r\npreamble to the First Statute of Westminster. It has now come to be\r\nemployed entirely to describe that combination of the Three Estates,\r\nthe Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal and the Commons, which with\r\nthe Crown form the supreme legislative government of the country.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Britons possessed a Parliament of a kind, called the\r\n_Commune Concilium_. Under the Heptarchy each king in England enjoyed\r\nthe services of an assembly of wise men--or Witenagemot, as it was\r\ncalled--which advised him upon matters of national importance. The\r\nWitan sat as a court of justice, formed the Council of the chiefs, and\r\ncould impose taxes and even depose the King, though the latter too\r\noften took the whole of their powers into his own hands. When the\r\nseparate kingdoms became united, their different Councils were\r\nabsorbed into the one great Gemot of Wessex. This, in Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes, was a small body, consisting of less than a score of Bishops, a\r\nnumber of Ealdormen (or heads of the different shires), and certain\r\nvassal members. This senate was undoubtedly the germ of all future\r\nsystems of Parliamentary government; and though for the first two\r\nhundred years after the Conquest there is no historical record of the\r\nmeeting of any body corresponding to our present Parliament, from the\r\ndays of the Witenagemot to our own times the continuity of our\r\nnational assemblies has never been broken.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary historian suffers much from the lack of early\r\nrecords. None were kept in Anglo-Saxon times, the judgments of the\r\nWitan being only recorded in the memory of the judges themselves. The\r\nRolls of Parliament begin with the year 1278--though the first mention\r\nof the Commons does not occur until 1304--and somewhere about Edward\r\nIII.'s reign was written a volume called the \"Vetus Codex\" or \"Black\r\nBook\" which contains transcripts of various parliamentary proceedings.\r\nAt the time of the restoration of Charles II., Prynne, the\r\nantiquarian, set himself the task of exhuming old records, and\r\ncatalogued nearly a hundred parcels of ancient writs, private\r\npetitions, and returns. The MSS. which he worked upon were so dirty\r\nthat he could not induce any one else to clean them, and was forced to\r\nlabour alone. Wearing a nightcap over his eyes, to keep out the dust,\r\nand fortified by continual draughts of ale, he proceeded cheerfully\r\nwith this laborious undertaking upon which he finally based the book\r\nwhich has made him famous.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] \"A Brief Register of Parliamentary Writs\" (1664).\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Journals begin with Edward VI. those of the Lords\r\nat the accession of Henry VIII. And though during the early part of\r\nthe seventeenth century speeches were reported at some length in the\r\nCommons Journals, in the Lords only the Bills read and such matters\r\nare recorded.[5] The material to work upon is consequently of an\r\nexiguous nature, until we reach the later days of freedom of the Press\r\nand publicity of debates.\r\n\r\n  [5] Elsynge, Clerk of the Parliaments in the seventeenth century, took\r\n  notes of the Lords' speeches, which have been published by the Camden\r\n  Society (1870-1879).\r\n\r\nThe history of Parliament proper divides itself naturally into four\r\ndistinct periods. The first may be said to stretch from the middle of\r\nthe thirteenth to nearly the end of the fifteenth century; the second\r\ndates from the accession of Henry VII., and extends to the Revolution\r\nof 1688. The remaining century and a half, up to the Reform Bill of\r\n1832, forms the third period; and with the passing of that momentous\r\nAct commences the last and most important epoch of all.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two periods of parliamentary history, the whole\r\nauthority of government was vested in the Crown; during the third it\r\ngradually passed into the possession of the aristocracy: and it is\r\nonly within the last century that the people, through their\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Commons, have gained a complete\r\npolitical ascendency.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the absolute monarchy of Norman sovereigns until the\r\nreign of King John, the Crown, the Church, the Barons, and the people,\r\nwere always struggling with each other; in that reign the three last\r\nforces combined against the King. The struggle was never subsequently\r\nrelaxed, but it took over six centuries to transfer the governing\r\npower of the country from the hands of one individual to that of the\r\nwhole people.\r\n\r\nPrior to the reign of Henry III., no regular legislative assembly\r\nexisted, though the King would occasionally summon councils of the\r\ngreat men of the land for consultative purposes. In William the\r\nConqueror's time the ownership of land became the qualification for\r\nthe Witenagemot, and the National Council which succeeded that\r\nassembly thus became a Council of the King's feudal vassals, and not\r\nnecessarily an assembly of wise men. When, however, Simon de Montford\r\noverthrew Henry III. at Lewes, he summoned a convocation which\r\nincluded representative knights and burgesses, and the parliamentary\r\nsystem, thus instituted, was subsequently adopted by Edward I. \"Many\r\nthings have changed,\" says Dr. Gardiner in his \"History of England,\"\r\n\"but in all main points the Parliament of England, as it exists at\r\nthis day, is the same as that which gathered around the great\r\nPlantagenet.\" The first full Parliament in English history may,\r\ntherefore, be said to have been summoned by Edward I. on November 13,\r\n1295, and represented every class of the people.\r\n\r\nParliament thereafter gradually resolved itself into two separate\r\ngroups; on the one hand the barons and prelates, representing the\r\naristocracy and the Church, on the other the knights and burgesses,\r\nrepresenting the county freeholders, citizens and boroughfolk. The\r\nformer constituted a High Court of Justice and final Court of Appeal;\r\nthe chief duty of the latter lay in levying taxes, and they were not\r\nusually summoned unless the Crown were in need of money. These two\r\ncomponent groups originally sat together, forming a collective\r\nassembly from which the modern Parliament has gradually developed.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Parliament the Lords came to be regarded as the\r\nKing's Council, over which he presided in person; the Commons occupied\r\na secondary and insignificant position. The power of legislating was\r\nentirely in the hands of the King, who framed whatever laws he deemed\r\nexpedient, acting on the humble petition of his people. The Crown thus\r\nexercised absolute control over Parliament, and the royal yoke was not\r\ndestined to be thrown off for many hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III., the meetings of Parliament were uncertain\r\nand infrequent; its duration was brief. Three or four Parliaments\r\nwould be held every year, and only sat for a few weeks at a time. The\r\nKing's prerogative to dissolve Parliament whenever he so desired--\"of\r\nall trusts vested in his majesty,\" as Burke says, \"the most critical\r\nand delicate\"[6] was one of which mediæval monarchs freely availed\r\nthemselves in the days when Parliament had not yet found, nor indeed\r\nrealised, its potential strength.\r\n\r\n  [6] \"Works and Correspondence,\" vol. iii. p. 525. (The power to\r\n  dissolve Parliament is still theoretically in the hands of the\r\n  Sovereign; practically it is in those of the Cabinet. Parliament has\r\n  only been dissolved once by the Sovereign since the beginning of the\r\n  eighteenth century.)\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of the Tudors and Stuarts, the power of the Crown\r\nwas still supreme, though many attempts were made to weaken it. This\r\nsecond period of history, between 1485 and 1688, was a time of\r\npeculiar political stress, in which Parliament and the Crown were\r\nengaged in a perpetual conflict. Kings maintained their influence by a\r\nmixture of threats and cajolery which long proved effective. In 1536,\r\nfor instance, we find Henry VIII. warning the House of Commons that,\r\nunless some measure in which he was interested were passed, certain\r\nmembers of that assembly would undoubtedly lose their heads.[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] Oldfield's \"History of Great Britain and Ireland,\" vol. i.\r\n        p. 280.\r\n\r\nThe Stuart kings were in the habit of suborning members of both\r\nHouses, by the gift of various lucrative posts or the lavish\r\ndistribution of bribes. It was ever the royal desire to weaken\r\nParliament, and this end was attained in a variety of ways. In the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth century, we hear of Charles I. summoning\r\nto Hampton Court certain members whose loyalty he distrusted or whose\r\nabsence from Parliament he desired. On one such occasion the Earls of\r\nEssex and Holland refused to obey his command, saying that their\r\nparliamentary writ had precedence of any royal summons--an expression\r\nof independence for which they were dismissed from the Court.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] May's \"A Breviary of the History of Parliament\" (1680), p. 21.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles II. a definite system of influencing members of\r\nParliament by gifts of money was first framed, Lord Clifford, the Lord\r\nTreasurer, being allowed a sum of £10,000 for the purpose. The fact of\r\nholding an appointment in the pay of the Crown was in itself\r\nconsidered sufficient to bind a member to vote in accordance with the\r\nroyal will. In 1685, when many members who were in the Government\r\nservice threatened to vote against the Court, Middleton, the Secretary\r\nof State, bitterly reproached them with breach of faith. \"Have you not\r\na troop of horse in his Majesty's service?\" he asked of a certain\r\nCaptain Kendall. \"Yes, my lord,\" was the reply, \"but my brother died\r\nlast night and left me £700 a year!\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Burnet's \"History of His Own Times,\" vol. iii. p. 92 n.\r\n\r\nAndrew Marvell has drawn a vivid but disagreeable picture of the\r\nParliament which was summoned immediately after the Restoration. Half\r\nthe members of the House of Commons he described as \"court\r\ncullies\"--the word \"to cully\" meaning apparently to befool or\r\ncheat--and in \"A list of the Principal Labourers in the great Design\r\nof Popery and Arbitrary Law,\" gives a catalogue of the names of over\r\ntwo hundred members of Parliament who received presents from the Court\r\nat this time.[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] _E.g._, \"Sir Edward Turner, who for a secret service had lately a\r\n  bribe of £4000, as in the Exchequer may be seen, and about £2000\r\n  before; and made Lord Chief Baron.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Stephen Fox--once a link boy; then a singing boy at Salisbury;\r\nthen a serving man; and permitting his wife to be common beyond sea,\r\nat the Restoration was made Paymaster of the Guards, where he has\r\ncheated £100,000, and is one of the Green Cloth.\" \"Flagellum\r\nParliamentarium,\" pp. 10 and 24.\r\n\r\nThe independence of Parliament was first asserted by that staunch old\r\npatriot Sir John Eliot, who, during the reign of Charles I., declared\r\nto the Commons that they \"came not thither either to do what the King\r\nshould command them, nor to abstain when he forbade them; they came to\r\ncontinue constant, and to maintain their privileges.\"[11] But in spite\r\nof such brave words, the power of the Crown was not finally subdued\r\nuntil the Revolution.\r\n\r\n  [11] Forster's \"Life of Sir John Eliot,\" vol. i. p. 529.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the Monarchy at the time of the Commonwealth was\r\nfollowed by the temporary abolition of both Lords and Commons, the\r\nlatter disappearing in company with Cromwell's famous \"bauble.\" The\r\nProtector then proceeded to call together a body of \"nominees,\" one\r\nhundred and forty in number, who represented the various counties in\r\nproportion to the amount of taxes each of these contributed. Of the\r\nseven nominees supplied by London, Praise God Barebones, a Fleet\r\nStreet leather merchant, gave his name to the Parliament thus\r\nassembled. Cromwell also created a new House of Lords, numbering about\r\nsixty.[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] See \"Journal of the Protectorate House of Lords, from the\r\n  original MS. in the possession of Lady Tangye, January 20, 1657, to\r\n  April 22, 1659.\" House of Lords MSS. vol. iv. new series, p. 503.\r\n\r\nWith the Restoration the Crown resumed much of its former power. In\r\n1682 the publisher of a reprint of Nathaniel Bacon's \"Historical\r\nDiscourse,\" which declared that Kings could \"do nothing as Kings but\r\nthat of Right they ought to do,\" and that though they might be \"Chief\r\nCommanders, yet they are not Chief Rulers,\" was outlawed for these\r\ntreasonable statements. It was not, indeed, until the Revolution of\r\n1688 that the royal influence was curtailed, so small a revenue being\r\nallowed to William III. that the ordinary expenses of government could\r\nnot be defrayed without assembling Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe attendance of the King in Parliament had been usual in early days,\r\nbut the Commons always deprecated the presence of the Sovereign in\r\ntheir midst. Charles I. affords the only example of a monarch\r\nattending a debate in the Lower House, when on that famous 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1642, he marched from Whitehall to Westminster, with the\r\nintention of arresting the five leading members, Hampden, Pym, Holles,\r\nHaselrig and Strode, authors of the Grand Remonstrance, whom he had\r\ncaused to be impeached on the preceding afternoon. The House had been\r\nput upon its guard by Lady Carlisle, and on the eventful day, a French\r\nofficer, Hercule Langres, made his way to Westminster and warned Pym\r\nand his colleagues of the approach of the royal troops. When therefore\r\nthe King arrived he found that his birds had already flown, and was\r\ncompelled to retire empty-handed, amid cries of \"Privilege!\" from\r\nmembers of the outraged assembly.\r\n\r\nIn those times the desire of the Commons was to keep the Crown as\r\nignorant as possible on the subject of their doings. The habit of\r\nproviding the King with a daily account of Parliamentary proceedings\r\ndid not come into fashion until the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen the House was no longer afraid of the royal power.\r\n\r\nThe Lords have never objected as strongly as the Commons to the royal\r\npresence. Charles II. often found the time hang heavy on his hands,\r\nand would stroll down to the Upper House, \"as a pleasant diversion.\"\r\nHe began by sitting quietly on the Throne, listening to the debates.\r\nLater on he took to standing by the fireplace of the Lords, where he\r\nwas soon surrounded by many persons anxious to gain the royal ear, and\r\nthus \"broke all the decency of that House.\"[13] Since the accession of\r\nQueen Anne, however, no Sovereign has been present in Parliament, save\r\nat the opening or closing ceremonies. But long after kings had ceased\r\nto attend Parliament in person they continued to attempt the control\r\nof its proceedings. George III. finally brought matters to a head by\r\nhis perpetual interference with the affairs of the Commons, and caused\r\nthe passing of that momentous resolution, moved by Dunning on April 6,\r\n1780, \"that the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing,\r\nand ought to be diminished,\" which disturbed if it could not vex Dr.\r\nJohnson.[14]\r\n\r\n  [13] Burnet's \"History of His Own Time,\" vol. i. p. 184.\r\n\r\n  [14] \"Public affairs vex no man,\" said Dr. Johnson, when asked whether\r\n  he were not annoyed by this vote. \"I have never slept an hour less,\r\n  nor eat an ounce less meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on\r\n  the head, to be sure; but I was not _vexed_.\"\r\n\r\nBetween 1688 and 1832 political life in England was excessively\r\ncorrupt. Parliament had grown to a certain extent independent of the\r\nCrown, but had not yet learnt to depend upon public opinion. It was\r\nconsequently a difficult body to deal with, and had to be managed by a\r\nsystem of open bribery which first showed itself most conspicuously in\r\nthe shape of retaining fees paid to Scottish members.[15] In 1690 the\r\npractice of regularly bribing members of the House of Commons was\r\nundertaken by the Speaker, Sir John Trevor, on behalf of the Tory\r\nparty. In Queen Anne's reign a statesman paid thousands of pounds for\r\nthe privilege of being made Secretary of State, and a few years later\r\nwe find Sir Robert Walpole assuring a brother of Lord Gower that he\r\nknew the price of every man but three in the House of Lords.[16]\r\n\r\n  [15] Boswell's \"Life of Johnson,\" p. 731. (Cromwell had already\r\n  stigmatized Scotland as corrupt. He had been told, he said, that it\r\n  was a poor country inhabited by honest people, but found that the\r\n  country was not poor and the people anything but honest.)\r\n\r\n  [16] Dr. King's \"Anecdotes of His Own Time,\" p. 44.\r\n\r\nBribery no longer emanated direct from the Crown, but was practised\r\nvicariously by the King through his ministers. They might object to\r\nthe system, but, as King William once said to Bishop Burnet, they had\r\nto do with \"a set of men who must be managed in this vile way or not\r\nat all.\"[17] Macaulay likens the Parliament of that time to a pump\r\nwhich, though it may appear dry, will, if a little water is poured\r\ninto it, produce a great flow. So, he says, £10,000 given in bribes to\r\nParliament would often produce a million in supplies.[18] Even Pelham,\r\na man of unblemished reputation in private life, saw the absolute\r\nnecessity of distributing bribes right and left. And in 1782 we find\r\nLord North writing to George III. to remind him that \"the last general\r\nelection cost near £50,000 to the Crown, beyond which expense there\r\nwas a pension of £1000 a year to Lord Montacute and £500 a year to Mr.\r\nSelwyn for their interest at Midhurst and Luggershall.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [17] \"History of His Own Time,\" vol. ii. p. 76.\r\n\r\n  [18] \"History,\" vol. iii. p. 545.\r\n\r\n  [19] \"Correspondence of George III. and Lord North,\" vol. ii. p. 425.\r\n\r\nSeats in Parliament were regularly bought and sold, the price varying\r\nfrom £1500 to as much as £7000. Flood, the Irish politician, purchased\r\na seat in the English House of Commons for £4000. The notoriously\r\ncorrupt borough of Gatton was publicly advertised for sale in 1792,\r\nwith the power of nominating two representatives for ever, described\r\nby the auctioneer as \"an elegant contingency.\"[20] This same seat was\r\nsold in 1831 by Sir Mark Wood for the huge sum of £60,000, and the\r\npurchaser's feelings may well be imagined when, under the Reform Act\r\nof the following year, the borough was disfranchised and rendered\r\nworthless.[21]\r\n\r\n  [20] Bell's \"Life of Canning,\" p. 347.\r\n\r\n  [21] Mark Boyd's \"Social Gleanings,\" p. 246.\r\n\r\nParliament was for long in the hands of a few rich persons. Wealthy\r\nindividuals would buy property in small boroughs in order to increase\r\ntheir political influence, and cared little for the fitness of the\r\nrepresentatives whom they nominated. The story is told of a peer being\r\nasked who should be returned for one of his boroughs, and casually\r\nmentioning a waiter at White's Club whom he did not even know by name.\r\nThe waiter was duly elected, and, for aught we know, may have made a\r\nmost worthy and excellent member of Parliament.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Russell's \"Recollections,\" p. 35.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 the House of Commons contained 471 members who were the\r\ncreatures of 144 peers and 123 Commoners. Sixteen representatives were\r\nGovernment nominees; and only 171 members were actually elected by the\r\npopular vote.[23] Five years later nearly half the House were returned\r\nby peers.[24]\r\n\r\n  [23] Oldfield's \"Representative History,\" vol. vi., App.\r\n\r\n  [24] \"The Black Book,\" vol. i. p. 430.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Septennial Act in 1716, in place of the Triennial\r\nAct of 1694, though meeting with much hostile criticism,[25] had\r\nhelped to further that growing independence of both Lords and Crown\r\nwhich was the chief aim of the Commons. Before the Triennial Act\r\nParliament could only be dissolved by the Crown. Under the Triennial\r\nAct it suffered a natural death three years after the day on which it\r\nwas summoned. The Septennial Act lengthened that existence by a\r\nfurther period of four years. Members were no longer kept in a state\r\nof perpetual anticipation of an imminent General Election; they were\r\nno more harassed by the fear of losing their seats at any moment. With\r\nsecurity came strength, but purity was a long time in following. The\r\nSeptennial Act, says Lecky, gave \"a new stability to English policy, a\r\nnew strength to the dynasty, and a new authority to the House of\r\nCommons.\" But it certainly did not tend to decrease the corruption\r\nwhich was then rampant both in Parliament and in the country.\r\n\r\n  [25] \"By the same violence that one Parliament, chosen but for _Three\r\n  Years_, could prolong their own sitting for _Seven_, any other may\r\n  presume to render themselves perpetual.\" Ralph's \"Uses and Abuses of\r\n  Parliament,\" vol. ii. p. 716.\r\n\r\nThe whole body politic was, indeed, utterly rotten, and it was only\r\nconsidered possible to maintain the ministerial influence by a system\r\nof disciplined Treasury corruption. The secret service money with\r\nwhich votes were bought was in the control of the Prime Minister, and\r\nWalpole is said to have stated that he did not care a rap who made\r\nMembers of Parliament so long as he was allowed to deal with them\r\nafter they were made. The produce of the taxes descended in\r\nfertilizing showers upon the proprietors, the agents and the members\r\nfor boroughs. For them, as Lord John Russell said, the General\r\nElection was a state lottery in which there was nothing but prizes.\r\n\"The elector of a borough, or a person he recommends, obtains a\r\nsituation in the Customs; the member of Parliament obtains a place in\r\nthe Mediterranean for a near relation; the proprietor of the borough\r\nobtains a peerage in perspective; and the larger proprietor, followed\r\nby his attendant members, shines in the summer of royal favour, with a\r\ngarter, a regiment, an earldom, or a marquisate.\"[26] So ingrained had\r\nthis idea become in the public mind that the Duke of Wellington is\r\nsupposed to have asked ingenuously, on the abolition of the rotten\r\nboroughs, \"How will the King's Government be carried on?\"\r\n\r\n  [26] \"Essays and Sketches of Life and Character,\" p. 148.\r\n\r\nSeveral ineffectual efforts had from time to time been made to slay\r\nthe monster of corruption. From the days of Cromwell the question of\r\nParliamentary reform had been anxiously urged by many statesmen,\r\nnotably Lord Shaftesbury and Pitt, of whom the latter introduced\r\nreformative measures in 1781, 1782 and 1785. But though Pitt, the\r\nfirst Prime Minister who did not retain any of the public money for\r\ndistribution among his friends and supporters, managed to reduce\r\n\"places\" worth over £200,000, after the American War, there still\r\nremained any number of inflated pensions and sinecures in the gift of\r\nthe Government,[27] and it was not until Parliament came to be\r\ncontrolled entirely by public opinion that the change from corruption\r\nto purity took place. But notwithstanding many flaws in theory and\r\nblots in practice, the English Parliamentary Constitution prior to the\r\nReform Bill was, as Mr. Gladstone called it, one of the wonders of the\r\nworld. \"Time was its parent, silence was its nurse.... It did much\r\nevil and it left much good undone; but it either led or did not lag\r\nbehind the national feeling and opinion.\"[28] With the Reform Act of\r\n1832, Parliament advanced another stage in its career. The House of\r\nCommons definitely shook itself free from the active corruption which\r\nhad so long impeded its movements.\r\n\r\n  [27] For example, one of £7000 for a retired Auditor of the Imprest,\r\n  and another of £7300 granted to Lord Bute as some slight compensation\r\n  for his loss of office. See Rose's \"Influence of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n  [28] \"Gleanings of Past Years,\" vol. i. pp. 134-5.\r\n\r\nThe principle of Party Government, which now lies at the very root of\r\nour parliamentary system, had its origin during the second period of\r\nparliamentary history, and formed no part of the constitutional scheme\r\nof earlier days.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Elizabeth's time two definite and distinct parties arose, the\r\none maintaining the privileges of the Crown, the other upholding the\r\ninterests of the people. In Stuart days Cavaliers and Roundheads were\r\nfollowed by Court and Country Parties, and in the year 1679, when the\r\nExclusion Bill was being bitterly debated, the distinctive names of\r\n\"Whigs\" and \"Tories\" first came into existence. \"Whig\" was originally\r\na word applied to the lowland peasantry of the West of Scotland;\r\nthence it came to mean Covenanters, and so politicians who looked\r\nkindly upon Nonconformity. \"Tory\" was an expression popularly used\r\nwith reference to the rebel Irish outlaws who harassed the\r\nProtestants; and thus implied leanings towards Catholicism.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] O'Connell showed Pryme an Irish Act of Parliament for the\r\n  suppression of \"Rapparees, Tories, and other Robbers.\" Pryme's\r\n  \"Recollections,\" p. 231.\r\n\r\nThe growth of a respect for the people's rights forced politicians to\r\nseparate into two sections, and the schism between the rival camps was\r\nstill further emphasized by the Revolution of 1688. Regular opposing\r\nparties do not, however, seem to have existed in the Commons until the\r\neighteenth century, and the party system was not finally established\r\nas a necessary element of constitutional government until the reign of\r\nWilliam III. Kings had hitherto chosen their advisers irrespective of\r\ntheir political views. William III. was, however, induced by the Earl\r\nof Sunderland to form a Ministry from the party that held a majority\r\nin Parliament, and thus became to a certain extent controlled by that\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThere have always been, as Macaulay says, under some name or other,\r\ntwo sets of men, those who are before their age, and those who are\r\nbehind it, those who are the wisest among their contemporaries, and\r\nthose who glory in being no wiser than their great-grandfathers. But\r\nthis definition of the two great political parties of England can no\r\nlonger with justice be applied. The Tory of to-day is not at all the\r\nTory of two hundred years ago: indeed, he rather resembles the Whig of\r\nQueen Anne's time. And though Disraeli continued to use the word\r\n\"Tory,\" and was never ashamed of it, it has now gradually fallen into\r\ndisuse, save as a term of reproach on the lips of political opponents.\r\nA change of nomenclature was adopted in 1832. The Tories became\r\nConservatives, and for the benefit of wavering Whigs it was proposed\r\nthat the latter should be known as Liberal-Conservatives, a name\r\nwhich, as Lord John Russell remarked, expressed in seven syllables\r\nwhat Whig expressed in one.[30] The term \"Radical\" did not come into\r\nuse until the days of the famous reformer, Francis Place (1771-1854);\r\nhis political predecessors contenting themselves with the more modest\r\nname of Patriots. Called by whatever name is popular for the moment,\r\neither party may now claim to come within the scope of Burke's\r\nwell-known definition as \"a body of men united for promoting, by their\r\nendeavours, the national interest upon some particular principle in\r\nwhich they are all agreed.\"\r\n\r\n  [30] A German writer, Herr Bucher, wrote as follows, in 1855:--\"It\r\n  would be difficult to give any other definition of the two parties\r\n  than that a Whig is a man who is descended from Lord John Russell's\r\n  grandmother, a Tory, one who sits behind Disraeli.\" \"Der\r\n  Parliamentarismus wie er ist,\" p. 152.\r\n\r\nOur modern parliamentary system comprises the party spirit as its most\r\nvital element, and owes its success to the fact of being government by\r\nparty and not by faction.[31] The existence of an admittedly\r\nconstitutional body perpetually opposed to the Government of the\r\nday--\"His Majesty's Opposition,\" as it has been called since 1826--is\r\nnow recognised as a very necessary portion of the Parliamentary\r\nmachine. The principle of fairness to the minority is never lost sight\r\nof, and expresses itself in many different ways. When, for instance,\r\nthe Leader of the Opposition gives notice of a motion of censure on\r\nthe Government, the latter consider it their duty to accord their\r\ncritics an early opportunity for its discussion; and, generally\r\nspeaking, the due consideration of the rights of minorities is among\r\nthe primary instincts of party government. The excellent effects of\r\nthis system are obvious. Of the two ways of obtaining political\r\nadherents the attachment of party is infinitely preferable to the\r\nattachment of personal interest, formerly so prolific a source of\r\ncorruption. Party feeling may also be said to have created general\r\nrules of politics, similar to a general code of morals by which a man\r\nmay \"walk with integrity along the path chosen by his chiefs,\r\nsurrounded and supported by his political colleagues.\"\r\n\r\n  [31] \"I have a maxim,\" wrote Horace Walpole to his friend Montague in\r\n  1760, \"that the extinction of party is the origin of faction.\"\r\n  \"Letters,\" vol. iii. 370.\r\n\r\nOpposition is invaluable as providing a stern criticism of the\r\nGovernment's policy; it can also very often be of service to the cause\r\nit is intended to injure. It excites a keener public curiosity, by\r\ndirecting attention to the motives of those whom it suspects. And \"the\r\nreproaches of enemies when refuted are a surer proof of virtue than\r\nthe panegyrics of friends.\"[32] That the system must possess certain\r\ndisadvantages is inevitable. It no doubt engenders animosity and\r\nprovokes violent contentions: it stimulates politicians to impute to\r\ntheir opponents corrupt motives which they could not for a moment\r\nimagine themselves capable of entertaining. It may also on occasion\r\ntempt them to continue obstinately in the support of wrong, because\r\nthe admission of a mistake would be hailed as a triumph for their\r\nenemies. \"The best cause in the world may be conducted into Faction,\"\r\nas Speaker Onslow said; \"and the best men _may_ become party men, to\r\nwhom all things appear lawful, which make for their cause or their\r\nassociates.\"[33] But as a rule the game of politics is played with\r\ncommendable fairness and an absence of undue acrimony. The Opposition,\r\nwhose well-known duty it is \"to oppose everything, to propose nothing,\r\nand to turn out the Government,\"[34] rarely makes its attacks the\r\nvehicle for personal spite. Politicians of adverse views do not carry\r\ntheir antagonism into private life, and off the stage of Parliament\r\nthe bitterest opponents are able to exist upon amicable terms.\r\nOccasionally, however, political differences have been the cause of\r\nruptured friendship. When Burke made a violent attack upon Fox, in\r\n1791, on the Canada Bill, he declared that if necessary he would risk\r\nthe latter's lifelong friendship by his firm and steady adherence to\r\nthe British Constitution. Fox leaned across and whispered that there\r\nwas no loss of friends. \"Yes,\" replied Burke, \"there _is_ a loss of\r\nfriends. I know the price of my conduct. I have done my duty at the\r\nprice of my friend. Our friendship is at an end!\" So terminated an\r\nintimacy of twenty-five years' standing. Such an incident may,\r\nnevertheless, be considered exceptional, the relations of antagonists\r\nbeing usually of a most harmonious kind. Sir Robert Peel and Lord John\r\nRussell would often be seen together engaged in friendly conversation.\r\nO'Connell once walked arm in arm down Whitehall with Hughes Hughes,\r\nthe member for Oxford, whose head he had but recently likened to that\r\nof a calf.[35] And the present Prime Minister and Leader of the\r\nOpposition are doubtless able to play bridge or golf together without\r\nactually coming to blows. In spite, therefore, of much criticism, what\r\nEmerson calls \"that capital invention of freedom, a constitutional\r\nopposition,\"[36] has been found to be the most practical and\r\nsatisfactory means of carrying on government.\r\n\r\n  [32] See Parr's \"Discourse on Education,\" p. 51.\r\n\r\n  [33] \"Anecdotes and other miscellaneous pieces\" left by the Rt. Hon.\r\n  Arthur Onslow. (From the MS. at Clandon.)\r\n\r\n  [34] This saying has often been wrongly attributed to Lord Randolph\r\n  Churchill. That statesman's most famous maxim on the subject of\r\n  Opposition is given in his son's \"Life\" (p. 188-9): \"Whenever by an\r\n  unfortunate occurrence of circumstances an Opposition is compelled to\r\n  support the Government,\" said Lord Randolph, \"the support should be\r\n  given with a kick and not with a caress, and should be withdrawn on\r\n  the first available moment.\"\r\n\r\n  [35] This was evidently a favourite simile of O'Connell's. He used it\r\n  again with reference to Mr. Shaw, member for Dublin University, in the\r\n  debate on the resolution for giving a grant to Maynooth College for\r\n  the education of Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\n  [36] \"English Traits,\" p. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo constitutional principle has been so strongly criticised and so\r\nfreely abused as the one embodied in the hereditary chamber which\r\nforms so important a branch of our legislature. Pulteney labelled the\r\nHouse of Lords a \"hospital for invalids\"; Burke contemptuously\r\nreferred to it as \"the weakest part of the Constitution\"; Lord\r\nRosebery has compared it to \"a mediæval barque stranded in the tideway\r\nof the nineteenth century.\" A more democratic modern statesman, who\r\ndoubtless hopes--\r\n\r\n    \"To build, not boast, a generous race;\r\n    No tenth transmitter of a foolish face,\"\r\n\r\nhas declared the only legislative qualifications of peers to consist\r\nin their being the first-born of persons possessing as little\r\nqualifications as themselves. While another politician cynically\r\nobserves that they represent nobody but themselves, and enjoy the full\r\nconfidence of their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords has long been the butt of the political satirist,\r\nand parliamentary reformers have attacked it for years patiently and\r\npersistently, hitherto without much success. \"We owe the English\r\nPeerage to three sources,\" said a character in \"Coningsby\"; \"the\r\nspoliation of the Church; the open and flagrant sale of its honours by\r\nthe elder Stuarts; and the borough-mongering of our own times.\" And\r\nthis bitter criticism is often quoted to prove the weakness of any\r\nform of hereditary government.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that heredity can confer any peculiar qualifications,\r\nrendering a person more fit than his fellows for parliamentary power,\r\nis no doubt illogical, but not more so perhaps than a thousand other\r\nideas which govern the affairs of men. The form of government by\r\nmajority, for instance,--which Pope called \"the madness of the many\r\nfor the gain of a few\"--is obviously open to criticism. Hereditary\r\nlegislation has, at any rate in the eyes of its supporters, the merit\r\nof having answered well enough in practice, and, however theoretically\r\nindefensible, is not more so than hereditary kingship. The Sovereign\r\ndoes not inherit sagacity any more than the Duke of Norfolk, as Lord\r\nJohn Russell justly observed, and it would be unwise as well as unsafe\r\nto hang the Crown on the peg of an exception. It is as well, however,\r\nto remember that the Sovereign is a constitutional monarch whose\r\npowers nowadays are much restricted, whereas the Lords have the right\r\nto exercise a legislative veto the use of which kings have long since\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nTalent is not hereditary. No man chooses a coachman, as the first Lord\r\nHalifax once remarked, because his father was a coachman before him.\r\nBut the descendant of a long line of coachmen is likely to know more\r\nabout the care of horses than the grandson of a pork butcher, however\r\neminent; and the scion of a race of legislators is at least as fully\r\nqualified for the duties of a legislator as many a politician whose\r\nchief reason for entering Parliament is the desire to add the letters\r\nM.P. to his name. Nevertheless, as has been recently pointed out by\r\ntactless statisticians, the great men of the past have but seldom\r\nbequeathed their admirable qualities to their _eldest_ sons, and in a\r\nlist of modern statesmen will be found but few of the names once\r\nfamous in English history.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a second chamber of some sort has always been\r\nadmitted, if only to prevent the other House from being exposed to\r\nwhat John Stuart Mill calls \"the corrupting influence of undivided\r\npower,\" and Cromwell \"the horridest arbitrariness that was ever known\r\nin the world.\" Few, however, of the most ardent admirers of the\r\nhereditary system will pretend that the problem of a perfect bicameral\r\nsystem is solved by the present House of Lords, though they may\r\ndoubtless claim that the cause of its failure does not rest entirely\r\nupon its basis of heredity. \"You might as well urge as an objection to\r\nthe breakwater that stems the unruly waves of the sea, that it has its\r\nfoundations deep laid in another element, and that it does not float\r\non the surface of that which it is to control,\" said Palmerston, \"as\r\nsay that the House of Lords, being hereditary, ought on that account\r\nto be reformed.\"[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] In a speech delivered at a banquet in Glasgow on January 13,\r\n  1837.\r\n\r\nIf age can confer dignity and distinction upon any assembly, then must\r\nthe House of Lords be peculiarly distinguished, for it is certainly\r\nthe most venerable as well as the most antiquated of our Parliamentary\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWhen Christianity became firmly established in England, each king of\r\nthe Heptarchy was attended by a bishop, whose business it was to\r\nadvise his royal master upon religious questions, and who thus\r\nacquired the power of influencing him in other matters as well. The\r\nminor kings were gradually replaced by earls, who were summoned,\r\ntogether with their attendant bishops, to the Witenagemot of the one\r\nruling sovereign of the country. An assembly of this nature was held\r\nas far back as 1086, but it was more in the nature of a judicial Court\r\nthan a Parliament. It consisted of the Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nall other bishops, earls, and barons, and was summoned to decide\r\nimportant judicial cases. This Court, or _Curia Regis_ as it was\r\ncalled, met at different times and in divers places. It transacted\r\nother business besides the judicial, and also corresponded to some\r\nextent with the more modern _levée_. It was originally composed of the\r\nLords, the great officers of State, and some others whom the king\r\nwished to consult.\r\n\r\nThe exact position which such nobles held in the great Council of the\r\nland is not very definite. Immediately after the Conquest an earldom\r\nappears to have been regarded as an office; but it was not necessarily\r\nhereditary. Later on the possession of lands, either granted direct by\r\nthe Crown or inherited, became a necessary qualification for the\r\nholder of an earldom. The transfer of titles and property in early\r\ndays was a rough and ready affair, in which might played as great a\r\npart as right. (When Edward I. required the old Earl de Warrenne to\r\nproduce his title deeds, the latter brought out a rusty sword that had\r\nbelonged to his ancestors. \"By this instrument do I hold my lands,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and by the same do I intend to defend them!\") But with the\r\nnatural idea of the transference of land from father to son there\r\ndeveloped the principle of the natural hereditary descent of the title\r\ndependent upon the possession of those lands.\r\n\r\nThe baronage did not come into existence until after the Conquest. In\r\nthe reign of Henry I. it was entirely composed of foreigners from\r\nFrance. Barons held no regular office, but their lands were\r\ntransferred on the hereditary principle. They owed military allegiance\r\nto the Crown, but did not necessarily sit in Parliament unless\r\nsummoned to attend by the king. Such a summons was long regarded as a\r\nburden rather than a privilege, and even in the days of King John the\r\nbarons only desired it as a protection from the imposition of some\r\nexceptional tax. The bishops and barons were then the natural leaders\r\nof the people; they alone were educated and armed, and they alone\r\ncould attempt any successful resistance to the exorbitant demands of\r\nthe Crown. They paid nearly all the taxes, and provided money for the\r\nprosecution of every war. Upon them the commonalty was dependent,\r\nlooking to them for assistance when the sovereign became too grasping\r\nor tyrannical. It was the barons who forced King John to sign Magna\r\nCharta, and to them, therefore, we are indebted for the laws and\r\nconstitution which we now possess. \"They did not confine it to\r\nthemselves alone,\" as Chatham declared in the House of Lords, on\r\nJanuary 9, 1770, \"but delivered it as a common blessing to the whole\r\npeople.\" But though the present House of Lords has been described as\r\ncomposed of descendants of the men who wrung the Charter from King\r\nJohn on the plains of Runnymede, not more than four of the existing\r\npeerages are, as a matter of fact, as old as Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nThe feudal barons by tenure, whose right to a Parliamentary summons\r\ngradually became hereditary as going with their lands, were gradually\r\njoined by other prominent men who, though not landowners, were\r\nsummoned to give the Council the benefit of their experience and\r\nadvice. Thus gradually evolved the modern system of hereditary\r\nlegislators, and the House of Lords developed into an assembly such as\r\nwe now know it, though numerically far smaller.\r\n\r\nIn Richard II.'s reign the _Curia Regis_ separated from Parliament and\r\nbecame a Privy Council. The Lords were then as unwilling as the\r\nCommons to attend diligently to their Parliamentary duties, and it was\r\nonly the subsequent creation of dukes, marquesses, and viscounts that\r\nstimulated the desire to sit and claim a writ of summons as a right.\r\n\r\nThe number of earls and barons summoned to Parliament in the reigns of\r\nthe first three Edwards varied from fifty to seventy-five. At times,\r\nowing to the absence of the fighting men of the country who were\r\nengaged in foreign warfare, it fell as low as sixteen. In the first\r\nParliament of Henry VIII. there were less than thirty temporal peers,\r\nbut in Elizabeth's time this number had doubled. Since Stuart days the\r\nLords have become more and more numerous. James I. granted peerages\r\nright and left to his favourites, and, by selling baronies,\r\nviscountcies, and earldoms for sums ranging from £10,000 to £20,000,\r\nenriched his coffers and added some fifty members to the Upper House.\r\nThe eighty-two temporal peers who sat in his first Parliament were\r\ngradually reinforced by his successors, until, in the time of George\r\nIII., they numbered two hundred and twenty-four, exclusive of their\r\necclesiastical brethren.\r\n\r\nThe Lords spiritual have not always sat in the House of Lords. In\r\nearly days the abbots and priors largely predominated in that\r\nassembly, but with the abolition of the monasteries they were banished\r\nfrom it, though a certain number retained their seats in right of the\r\nbaronies which they possessed.[38] Bishops were excluded from the\r\nHouse of Lords by Act of Parliament in 1640--Cromwell omitted to\r\nsummon them to his Upper House in 1657--and were not finally\r\nreadmitted until 1661. Within living memory several unsuccessful\r\nattempts have been made to keep them out of Parliament. In 1836 a\r\nmember of the Commons moved that spiritual peers be released from\r\nattendance, but his motion was defeated. Another member in the\r\nfollowing year suggested their exclusion on the ground that they had\r\nplenty to occupy them elsewhere, that their contributions to debate\r\nupon most legislative subjects were not particularly edifying, and\r\nthat they always voted with the Minister to whom they were indebted\r\nfor preferment. This motion met a fate similar to that of its\r\npredecessor, as did another of the same kind in 1870.\r\n\r\n  [38] In the sixteenth century the Prior of the Hospital of St. John of\r\n  Jerusalem (near Clerkenwell), whom Selden calls \"a kind of an otter, a\r\n  knight half-spiritual and half-temporal,\" had precedence of all the\r\n  lay barons in Parliament. His priory was suppressed in 1536, but his\r\n  name continued to appear spasmodically in the Journals of the House of\r\n  Lords until some time in Queen Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nTo-day some twenty-six spiritual peers, including the two Archbishops\r\nof Canterbury and York, are given seats in the House of Lords, where\r\nthey help to swell the number of that ever-increasing assembly.\r\n\r\nBishops usually confine themselves exclusively in the House of Lords\r\nto the discussion of matters which concern the spiritual welfare of\r\nthe nation. Their contributions to debates are generally \"edifying,\"\r\nand when they happen to cross swords with their lay brethren they are\r\nwell able to hold their own. Bishop Atterbury, of Rochester, once said\r\nof a Bill before the House that he had often prophesied that such a\r\nmeasure would be brought up, and was sorry to find himself a true\r\nprophet. Lord Coningsby retorted that the Right Reverend Prelate had\r\nput himself forward as a prophet, but he would only liken him to a\r\nBalaam, who was reproved by his own ass. The Bishop at once replied\r\nthat he was well content to be compared to Balaam. \"But, my Lords,\" he\r\nadded, \"I am at a loss to make out the other part of the parallel. I\r\nam sure that I have been reproved by nobody but his Lordship!\"[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] Dr. King's \"Anecdotes,\" p. 130. (It was a more modern politician\r\n  who, on being reproved by an opponent, said, \"Consider the case of\r\n  Balaam's ass; before it spoke all men regarded it as quite an ordinary\r\n  quadruped, but after it had spoken they discovered what an\r\n  extraordinary ass it was!\")\r\n\r\nWith the creation of new peerages by successive monarchs the list of\r\ntemporal peers lengthened year by year. The Union of the three\r\nkingdoms still further added to their number. By the Acts of Union\r\nwith Scotland and Ireland it was laid down that sixteen Scottish and\r\ntwenty-eight Irish representative peers should sit in the House of\r\nLords. These were to be elected by their fellow-peers, the former for\r\neach Parliament, the latter for life.[40] They may be distinguished in\r\nother particulars as well, for though a Scottish peer can at any time\r\nresign his seat, an Irish peer can never do so. Even though he be a\r\nlunatic, or otherwise incapable of attending, he still retains his\r\nplace in the legislature. He is also privileged in other ways. In 1699\r\nthe Commons resolved that no peer could give his vote at the election\r\nof a Member of Parliament, and, three years later, that he could not\r\ninterfere in elections. To-day a standing order of the House of\r\nCommons imposes the same restraint upon all but Irish peers, who are\r\nexempt from these restrictions.\r\n\r\n  [40] In November, 1908, the election of an Irish peer resulted in a\r\n  tie between Lords Ashtown and Farnham. Such a thing had not happened\r\n  since the Union. The difficulty was settled in a manner only perhaps\r\n  possible in an institution as venerable as the House of Lords. In\r\n  accordance with the provisions of the Act of Union, the Clerk of the\r\n  Parliaments wrote the names of the candidates on two pieces of paper\r\n  which he then put into a glass. One of these he drew out at random,\r\n  and the peer whose name was inscribed thereon was declared to be duly\r\n  elected.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the House of Lords was strengthened judicially by the\r\nintroduction of four Lords of Appeal. The House, as is well known,\r\nhas judicial as well as legislative functions to perform. It has\r\nalways been the Supreme Court of the realm, and, ever since the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, the ultimate Appeal has lain to it in all cases\r\nexcept those arising in Ecclesiastical Courts. Moreover, as the High\r\nCourt of Parliament, in conjunction with the Commons, it is empowered\r\nto try offenders against the State whom the Commons have impeached. It\r\nalso enjoys the privilege of trying any of its own members who may be\r\ncharged with treason or felony, and of determining any disputed claims\r\nof peerage which may arise.\r\n\r\nThere have always been a sufficient number of Lords learned in the law\r\nto provide a court for the trial of legal cases. In the past, however,\r\noccasions have arisen when the presence of lay peers has threatened to\r\nreplace the judicial aspect of the House by a political one which\r\nwould be fatal to its reputation as a court of appeal. It was not,\r\nindeed, until 1845 that lords unlearned in the law began to consider\r\ntheir presence during the hearing of judicial causes to be not only\r\nunnecessary but undesirable, and discontinued their attendance. Thirty\r\nyears later the institution of four life peerages, conferred upon\r\neminent lawyers, added still further weight to the legal decisions of\r\nthe House. The hearing of appeals is now left entirely to what are\r\ncalled the Law Lords, who consist of the Lord Chancellor, a number of\r\npeers who have held certain high judicial offices, and the four Lords\r\nof Appeal in Ordinary--three of whom must, by the Appellate\r\nJurisdiction Act of 1876, be present on all appeal cases.\r\n\r\nThe granting of life peerages, conferring rights of summons to the\r\nHouse of Lords, save as above stated, has been adjudged to be beyond\r\nthe powers of the Crown. It may truly be said that in the first days\r\nof Parliament the House of Lords consisted almost entirely of life\r\nmembers. But when the Government of Queen Victoria attempted to revive\r\na practice that had lain in abeyance for some centuries they were not\r\nallowed to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal had been violently attacked in the\r\nCommons, where certain members declared it to be inferior to any\r\ntribunal in the land. Palmerston in 1856 determined to remedy its\r\ndefects by the addition of two Law Lords who should be life peers.\r\nThis scheme was upheld by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cranworth, but met\r\nwith determined opposition in the Upper House. The Law Lords were\r\nespecially opposed to it, fearing that, if such a precedent were\r\nallowed, no lawyer in the future would ever be given an hereditary\r\npeerage. On the Premier's recommendation the Queen proposed to confer\r\nlife peerages upon two distinguished lawyers, Parke and Pemberton\r\nLeigh, and proceeded to issue a patent to the former, creating him\r\nBaron Wensleydale for life. When, however, the matter was referred to\r\nthe Committee for Privileges, they decided that no life peer could\r\neither sit or vote in the House of Lords, and the Wensleydale and\r\nKingsdown peerages had consequently to be made hereditary.\r\n\r\nPersons who are raised to the peerage to-day are made peers of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. No Scotch peer has been created since the Union in\r\n1707, and the right of conferring an Irish peerage which existed under\r\ncertain restrictions in the Act of Union has ceased to be exercised\r\nexcept upon one notable recent occasion.[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] Lord Curzon of Kedleston was so created in 1898.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifty years some one hundred and fifty additions have\r\nbeen made to the membership of the House of Lords. The only limit to\r\nthe numerical increase of peers would seem to lie in the good sense of\r\nthe Prime Minister or the patience of the Sovereign. It is of course\r\nthe latter who confers peerages, though as the former usually brings\r\nsuitable candidates for ennoblement to the royal notice, he is\r\ngenerally held responsible for the result of his recommendations.[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] When the last Liberal Government of Queen Victoria came into\r\n  office the Court officials were discussing the new Administration one\r\n  day at Windsor. \"I wonder what peers they'll make,\" remarked one of\r\n  the ladies-in-waiting. The Queen turned upon her with uplifted\r\n  eyebrows. \"_They!_\" she exclaimed. An uncomfortable silence ensued.\r\n  Again, in 1909, a Cabinet Minister's allusion in a speech to certain\r\n  newspaper proprietors whom a Conservative Prime Minister had \"taken\r\n  the precaution to make into barons\" inspired the King's private\r\n  Secretary to write a letter to a correspondent in which he stated\r\n  that, notwithstanding the Minister's statement, \"the creation of Peers\r\n  remains a Royal prerogative.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN 1742\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING BY JOHN FINE]\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords now includes some 616 members, divided, as we have\r\nseen, into four classes; the Lords Spiritual, the Lords\r\nTemporal--Princes of the Blood, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts,\r\nBarons--the Representative Peers of Scotland and Ireland, and the\r\nLords of Appeal in Ordinary.\r\n\r\nThe writ of summons, which did not cease to be regarded as a burden\r\nuntil the reign of Edward II., is now looked upon as a privilege and\r\nright which few peers would willingly forego. And the question of\r\nmutual precedence which was never mooted until the creation of\r\nViscounts in Henry VI.'s time, is now a matter of the utmost\r\nimportance to the occupants of the Gilded Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe first Parliament that is recognized as conferring the right of\r\npeerage was that of the eleventh year of Edward I. The Lords decided,\r\nin the recent case of Lord Stourton claiming the Barony of Mowbray,\r\nthat a writ summoning a peer to this Parliament, followed by a\r\nsitting, gave his descendants a seat in the House.\r\n\r\nAll Peers of the Realm--a phrase which came into use in 1322--are\r\nentitled to seats in the House of Lords once they have attained their\r\nmajority. Infancy disqualifies a peer from receiving a writ of\r\nsummons; failure to take the oath or to affirm deprives him of the\r\nright of sitting. No alien may sit in the Lords, nor may a bankrupt or\r\na felon, and the House as a Court of Justice may at any time pass\r\nsentence disqualifying a peer from sitting.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Upper House which have been the subject of so\r\nmuch recent controversy and are still engrossing the attention of\r\nParliament and the public, have been in former times variously defined\r\nby friendly or adverse critics. The Lords have been described as the\r\nbrake on the parliamentary wheel or as the clog in the parliamentary\r\nmachine. Horace Walpole wrote some bitter verses on the subject of\r\nthat House whose members \"sleep in monumental state, to show the spot\r\nwhere their great Fathers sate;\"\r\n\r\n    \"Thou senseless Hall, whose injudicious space,\r\n    Like Death, confounds a various mismatched race,\r\n    Where Kings and clowns, th' ambitious and the mean,\r\n    Compose th' inactive soporific scene.\"[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] \"Letters to Sir H. Mann,\" vol. i. p. 380.\r\n\r\nPeers themselves no doubt regard the Upper Chamber as a haven where\r\nmerit may receive its ultimate reward; where the achievements and the\r\nrecompense of the deserving are suitably immortalized. As a \"compact\r\nbulwark against the temporary violence of popular passion,\" to use\r\nDisraeli's phrase, and as a council for weighing the resolutions of\r\nthe Commons who may at times be led away by public clamour or a sudden\r\nimpulse, the Second Chamber is regarded by its defenders as of the\r\ngreatest constitutional value. Lord Salisbury once declared that the\r\nchief duty of the House of Lords was to represent the permanent as\r\nopposed to the passing feelings of the English nation; \"to interpose a\r\nsalutary obstacle to rash or inconsiderate legislation; and to protect\r\nthe people from the consequences of their own imprudence.\" Moreover,\r\nthe Upper House thus has an opportunity of improving the details of\r\nmeasures, many of which leave the House of Commons in an unworkable\r\nshape, owing to the conditions under which they are amended and passed\r\nthrough it, and, but for the alterations effected by the Lords, would\r\nremain unworkable when they came to be embodied in the Statute-book.\r\n\r\nIt has never been the course of the Upper House to resist a continued\r\nand deliberately expressed public opinion. The Lords, as Lord Derby\r\naffirmed in 1846, \"always have bowed and always will bow, to the\r\nexpression of such opinion.\"[44] But although history to a certain\r\nextent bears out this statement, on more than one occasion the hand of\r\npopular clamour has battered at their doors for a long time before\r\nwringing from them a reluctant acquiescence. There can be no doubt\r\nthat if the country were to express itself definitely upon any\r\nquestion at a General Election, no House of Lords would be strong\r\nenough (or weak enough) to attempt to thwart the public will. But\r\nthere have been numerous instances in which the peers have endeavoured\r\nwithout success to do so. In vain did they delay Parliamentary Reform\r\nin 1831, when Sidney Smith likened the House of Lords to Mrs.\r\nPartington, the old lady of Sidmouth who, during the great storm of\r\n1824, tried to push away the Atlantic with her mop.[45] In vain did\r\nthey inveigh against the passing of the Jewish Oaths Bill or the Bill\r\nfor the abolition of the Corn Laws. They were eventually compelled to\r\npass the latter, not because they thought it a good Bill, but because,\r\nas the Duke of Wellington said, it had passed the House of Commons by\r\na huge majority, and \"the Queen's Government must be supported.\"\r\n\r\n  [44] On the Second Reading of the Corn Importation Bill, May 25, 1846.\r\n\r\n  [45] \"Works,\" p. 564.\r\n\r\nOn the other side it may be said that they have occasionally\r\ninterpreted more successfully than the Lower House the views of the\r\nelectorate, and of this perhaps the rejection of the Home Rule Bill of\r\n1893 is the most prominent example.\r\n\r\nEven without actually rejecting Bills the Lords have frequently\r\nopposed the will of the Commons by returning the Bills sent up to them\r\nin so amended and altered a shape as to prove wholly unacceptable; and\r\nan appeal to the country upon every point of difference, or even upon\r\nevery Bill wholly rejected, is of course impracticable.\r\n\r\nIn some such cases the Commons have had recourse to a method of\r\ncoercing the Lords, known by the name of \"tacking,\" which depends for\r\nits efficacy upon the acceptation of certain doctrines relating to\r\nMoney Bills laid down by the Commons at intervals during the last\r\nthree centuries, and in the main acquiesced in by the Lords.\r\n\r\nThe history of the matter, though of acute interest at the present\r\ntime, is too long to go into here. It will be sufficient to mention\r\nthat in 1678, as the result of a violent struggle between the two\r\nHouses, the Commons passed Resolutions asserting (not for the first\r\ntime) that all Money Bills must have their origin in the Lower House,\r\nand that the Hereditary Chamber is powerless to amend them. And though\r\nthe Lords at the time protested against both these conclusions, by\r\ntheir action through a long course of years they must be taken to have\r\nacquiesced in them. If, then, the Lords were unable to amend a Money\r\nBill, they might be compelled to accept an obnoxious measure of a\r\ndifferent nature if it were included in such a Bill, the whole of\r\nwhich they would be loth to throw out. This was the process adopted in\r\nseveral instances by the Commons, against which the Lords passed, in\r\n1702, a Standing Order declaring the \"annexing any foreign matter\" to\r\nbe \"unparliamentary and tending to the destruction of the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1770 the Commons brought in a Bill to annul the royal grants of\r\nforfeited property, and, knowing that it would be objectionable to the\r\nUpper House, cunningly tacked it on to a Money Bill. The Lords\r\nreturned it, with the foreign matter excised; but it was sent back to\r\nthem once more, and, acting on the advice of the Duke of Marlborough\r\nwho counselled concession, they eventually swallowed the whole mixture\r\nas gracefully as they could find it in their hearts to do. In 1860,\r\nthe two Houses came into collision again on the same subject, when the\r\nLords threw out the Bill abolishing the duty on paper, which was a\r\nfinancial question. Gladstone retorted in the following year by\r\ntacking this Bill on to the Budget, and in this shape the Lords passed\r\nit. But their right of rejection--which indeed is involved in the\r\nnecessity for their assent to every Bill--was never questioned, either\r\nin 1678 or since, until the Budget Bill was thrown out in December,\r\n1909, when the whole question of the relations between the two Houses\r\nwas brought into vital prominence and made the subject of an agitation\r\nnot easily to be assuaged.\r\n\r\nThere has always existed a spirit of antagonism between the two\r\nHouses. Gladstone declared that the Commons were eyed by the Lords \"as\r\nLancelot was eyed by Modred,\" and this mutual antipathy has\r\noccasionally expressed itself in overt acts of rudeness. During a\r\ndebate in the Lords in 1770, on the defenceless state of the nation, a\r\npeer moved that the House be cleared of strangers. A number of the\r\nCommons happened to be standing at the Bar, but, notwithstanding their\r\nprotests, they were unceremoniously hustled out, being followed by a\r\nvolley of hisses and jeers as they left the Chamber. The Duke of\r\nRichmond and many other peers were so disgusted at this exhibition of\r\nill-feeling that they walked out of the House. Colonel Barré has left\r\na graphic description of the scene. The Lords, he says, developed all\r\nthe passions and violence of a mob. \"One of the heads of this mob--for\r\nthere were two--was a Scotchman. I heard him call out several times,\r\n'Clear the Hoose! Clear the Hoose!' The face of the other was scarcely\r\nhuman; for he had contrived to put on a nose of enormous size, that\r\ndisfigured him completely, and his eyes started out of his head in so\r\nfrightful a way that he seemed to be undergoing the operation of being\r\nstrangled.\"[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] The peer in question had not donned a false nose for the\r\n  occasion, as might be imagined, but was merely wearing the ordinary\r\n  working nose of aristocratic proportions with which Providence had\r\n  supplied him.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this scene, in 1772, Burke was kept waiting for three\r\nhours with a Bill which he was carrying from the Commons to the Lords.\r\nWhen he subsequently reported his ill-treatment to the Lower House,\r\ntheir indignation knew no bounds, and they proceeded to revenge\r\nthemselves in a somewhat puerile manner. The very next Bill that the\r\nHouse of Lords sent down to them was rejected unanimously, and the\r\nSpeaker threw the offensive measure on to the floor of the House,\r\nwhence it was kicked to the door by a number of indignant members.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand the cause of jealousy and anger\r\nbetween the Houses, in spite of the fact that so many of the Lords\r\nhave at one time or another been members of the Commons, and so many\r\nof the Commons hope to end their days in the Lords. (Croker, in a\r\nletter to Lord Hatherton, recalls a visit he paid as a stranger to the\r\nUpper House in 1857, where, of the thirty peers present, there was not\r\none but had sat with him in the Commons, including the Duke of\r\nWellington and the Lord Chancellor. \"It shows,\" he says, \"how\r\ncompletely the House of Commons has been the nursery of the House of\r\nLords.\"[47]) The resentment against the Lords that undoubtedly exists\r\nin the bosoms of the Commons, which is not confined to one side of the\r\nHouse, but seems to be universal, results from the power of rejection\r\nwhich the peers can at any time exercise with regard to a measure, or\r\nof making amendments by which they can alter it out of all\r\nrecognition, thus nullifying in a single day the labours of months in\r\nthe Lower House. And when it is considered that this ruinous result is\r\ndue not only to men who owe their seats to their successful exertions\r\nin various professions, but also in larger proportion to those who owe\r\nthem to being, as Lord Thurlow said of the Duke of Grafton, \"the\r\naccident of an accident,\"[48] the situation must to many minds appear\r\nwholly intolerable.\r\n\r\n  [47] Croker's \"Letters,\" vol. i. p. 85.\r\n\r\n  [48] One is reminded of the reply addressed by the Emperor Alexander\r\n  to Madame de Stael who was complimenting Russia on possessing so able\r\n  a ruler. \"Alas, Madame,\" he said, \"I am nothing but a happy accident!\"\r\n\r\nOne very clear cause of failure in the House of Lords to give\r\nsatisfaction lies in the fact that, although government by Party is\r\nthe very groundwork of the parliamentary constitution, as far as the\r\nUpper House is concerned such an idea might just as well not exist at\r\nall. Whatever the political complexion of the party in power in the\r\nHouse of Commons, the Lords maintain an invariable Conservative\r\nmajority, indifferent to the swing of any popular pendulum, and as\r\nfixed and unalterable as the sun. But at no time for the last century\r\nhas the inequality been so marked as at present, when it may be\r\ntruthfully said that the Liberal peers would scarcely fill a dozen\r\n\"hackney coaches.\"[49] And though the Liberal party has created a\r\nconsiderable number of peers during the last few years, it has never\r\nrecovered from the secession of Liberal Unionists, and it would take\r\nmany years of Liberal supremacy and large drafts upon the Prerogative\r\nof the Crown to restore even the comparative balance of early\r\nVictorian days.\r\n\r\n  [49] At the time of the French Revolution, the country supported the\r\n  Government so strongly that the Opposition dwindled away to nothing.\r\n  It was even jestingly asserted that the Whigs could all have been held\r\n  in one hackney coach. \"This is a calumny,\" said George Byng; \"we\r\n  should have filled two!\" Campbell's \"Lives of the Chancellors,\" vol.\r\n  v. p. 614.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not be an advantage, for though the staunch Tory is\r\ntempted to exclaim in the words of Disraeli: \"Thank God there is a\r\nHouse of Lords!\" the equally staunch Radical is scarcely likely to\r\nconsider the existence of this perpetually antagonistic majority a\r\nsufficient cause for gratitude towards the Almighty. The difficulty of\r\nequalising the parties seems insurmountable, so long as ennoblement is\r\nan expensive luxury and Peers continue to be drawn from the wealthy\r\nclasses.[50] There is, too, something essentially Conservative about\r\nthe atmosphere of the House of Lords, which sooner or later\r\nimpregnates the blood of its inmates; under its influence the Liberal\r\nof one generation rapidly exhibits a tendency to develop into the\r\nConservative of the next. But this charge is no doubt one which may be\r\nbrought with more or less truth against any Second Chamber, however\r\nconstituted, which is composed of men of a certain age and position,\r\nnot immediately responsible to the fluctuating voices of the people.\r\nWhether one considers such stability to be a merit or the reverse\r\ndepends upon whether one adopts Lord Palmerston's and Lord Salisbury's\r\nviews of the functions of a Senate, or regards it merely as a useful\r\nand select body of legislators enjoying certain limited powers of\r\ncriticism and delay.\r\n\r\n  [50] It is suggested that the balance of party could be adjusted by\r\n  the Government persuading the Crown to create a number of peerages\r\n  sufficient to flood the House with peers of their particular political\r\n  persuasion. In 1712, Queen Anne was prevailed upon to create twelve\r\n  peers in a single day, in order to pass a Government measure. \"If\r\n  these twelve had not been enough,\" said Bolingbroke, \"we could have\r\n  given them another dozen!\" William IV. was prepared to create a\r\n  hundred new peers to ensure the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. It\r\n  remains to be seen whether such an idea is nowadays practicable.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written about this great modern controversy, that it\r\nis unnecessary to increase the literature which exists upon both\r\nsides. The issue seems to lie between reducing the Second Chamber to\r\ncomparative impotence or attempting by judicious reforms in its\r\ncomposition to bring it into greater sympathy with the First Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions recently passed by the Commons,[51] have for their\r\nobject the complete annihilation of the latter in all matters of\r\nfinance, and the retention for them of such modified powers of\r\ninfluencing other legislation as would enable them to delay Bills\r\nduring the early years of a shortened Parliament, and refer them to\r\nthe country during its last two years. The question of \"tacking,\" in\r\nMoney Bills, is to be referred to the sole arbitrament of the Speaker;\r\nbut this becomes of trifling importance when it is argued that almost\r\nany revolutionary change could be effected within the corners of a\r\nlegitimate financial measure. The objection taken to the overriding of\r\nthe Veto in the case of a Bill thrice presented, is that it amounts to\r\none-Chamber legislation and would result in two classes of Acts--one\r\npassed by the Commons alone, and the other by both Houses.\r\n\r\n  [51] \"1. That it is expedient that the House of Lords be disabled by\r\n  Law from rejecting or amending a Money Bill, but that any such\r\n  limitation by Law shall not be taken to diminish or qualify the\r\n  existing rights and privileges of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\"For the purpose of this Resolution a Bill shall be considered a Money\r\nBill if, in the opinion of the Speaker, it contains only provisions\r\ndealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the\r\nimposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation;\r\nCharges on the Consolidated Funds or the provision of Money by\r\nParliament; Supply; the appropriation, control, or regulation of\r\npublic money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment\r\nthereof; or matters incidental to those subjects or any of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"2. That it is expedient that the powers of the House of Lords, as\r\nrespects Bills other than Money Bills, be restricted by Law, so that\r\nany such Bill which has passed the House of Commons in three\r\nsuccessive Sessions, and, having been sent up to the House of Lords at\r\nleast one month before the end of the Session, has been rejected by\r\nthat House in each of those sessions, shall become Law without the\r\nconsent of the House of Lords on the Royal Assent being declared;\r\nProvided that at least two years shall have elapsed between the date\r\nof the first introduction of the Bill in the House of Commons and the\r\ndate on which it passes the House of Commons for the third time.\r\n\r\n\"For the purposes of this Resolution a Bill shall be treated as\r\nrejected by the House of Lords if it has not been passed by the House\r\nof Lords either without Amendment or with such Amendments only as may\r\nbe agreed upon by both Houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"3. That it is expedient to limit the duration of Parliament to five\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy of Reform, on the other hand, is unacceptable to those who\r\ndesire the predominance of the First Chamber, as any successful scheme\r\nfor removing present defects in the constitution of the Lords--_e.g._\r\nthe excessive size of the House, the preponderance therein of one\r\nparty, and the presence of undesirable members--must result in its\r\nincreased strength and importance. Consequently the Commons have\r\nneither made nor encouraged any attempts in that direction.\r\n\r\nSuch suggestions as have taken any shape have been proposed by the\r\nLords themselves, and the history of the last thirty years exhibits\r\nmany internal efforts to reform on the part of those dissatisfied with\r\nthe ancient constitution of the House. In 1884, Lord Rosebery's motion\r\nfor a Select Committee to consider the best means of promoting the\r\nefficiency of the House of Lords, was negatived. Four years later he\r\nmoved for another Select Committee to inquire into the Constitution of\r\nthe House. In the same year an elaborate Bill of Lord Dunraven's for\r\nreforming the Lords was rejected, and another, promoted by Lord\r\nSalisbury, was withdrawn after having passed the second reading. In\r\n1908 a committee met, under the chairmanship of Lord Rosebery, to look\r\ninto the whole question, and issued a most interesting and practical\r\nreport, full of admirable recommendations. This committee began by\r\npointing out the expediency of reducing the numbers of an assembly\r\nwhich, within recent years has increased to such an extent as to\r\nrender itself too unwieldy for legislative purposes. It strongly urged\r\nthat the recommendations to the Crown for the creation of hereditary\r\npeerages should be restricted within somewhat narrower limits. Many\r\npeers, as the report explained, are obviously ill-suited to their\r\nParliamentary duties; others find the work irksome and distasteful; of\r\na few it may euphemistically be observed that their release from the\r\nburden of legislative responsibilities would be eminently desirable.\r\nLord Rosebery's committee therefore came to the conclusion that the\r\ndignity of a peer and the dignity of a Lord of Parliament should be\r\nseparate and distinct, and that, except in the case of peers of the\r\nBlood Royal, the possession of a peerage should not necessarily be\r\nattended with the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords. A\r\nfurther suggestion was made that the hereditary peers should be\r\nrepresented by two hundred of their number, elected by them to sit as\r\nLords of Parliament, not for life, but for each parliament, and that\r\nthe number of Spiritual Peers should be proportionately reduced to\r\nten. The inclusion of representatives from the Colonies, and the\r\ngranting of a writ of summons to a number of qualified persons who had\r\nheld high office in the State, figured prominently in this scheme of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nFollowing up these recommendations, the House on the motion of Lord\r\nRosebery has recently adopted the following resolutions for its own\r\nreconstitution:--\r\n\r\n     \"(1) That a strong and efficient Second Chamber is not\r\n     merely an integral part of the British Constitution, but is\r\n     necessary to the well-being of the State and to the balance\r\n     of Parliament.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) That such a Chamber can best be obtained by the reform\r\n     and reconstitution of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) That a necessary preliminary of such reform and\r\n     reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the\r\n     possession of a peerage should no longer of itself give the\r\n     right to sit and vote in the House of Lords.\"[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] The following further Resolutions stand upon the Notice Paper and\r\n  still await consideration:--\r\n\r\n  \"(1) That in future the House of Lords shall consist of Lords of\r\n  Parliament: A. Chosen by the whole body of hereditary peers from among\r\n  themselves and by nomination by the Crown. B. Sitting by virtue of\r\n  offices and of qualifications held by them. C. Chosen from outside.\r\n\r\n  \"(2) That the term of tenure for all Lords of Parliament shall be the\r\n  same, except in the case of those who sit ex-officio, who would sit so\r\n  long as they held the office for which they sit.\"\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes tempted nowadays to laugh, like \"the gardener Adam\r\nand his wife,\" at the claims of long descent. But the pride of birth\r\nand blood is common to all nations, perhaps less so in England than\r\nelsewhere. The French ducal family of Levis boasted a descent from the\r\nprinces of Judah, and would produce an old painting in which one of\r\ntheir ancestors was represented as bowing, hat in hand, to the Virgin,\r\nwho was saying, \"Couvrez-vous, mon cousin!\" Similarly the family of\r\nCory possessed a picture of Noah with one foot in the ark, exclaiming,\r\n\"Sauvez les papiers de la maison de Cory!\"[53] Byron is said to have\r\nbeen prouder of his pedigree than of his poems, and it is to be hoped\r\nthat our aristocracy will never entirely forget that their ancestors\r\nhave handed down to them traditions which are more precious than the\r\ntitles and lands by which they are represented.\r\n\r\n  [53] Hayward's \"Essays,\" p. 305.\r\n\r\nOne cannot altogether relish the sight of several peers, who had been\r\nconsidered incompetent to manage their own affairs, hastening to\r\nWestminster at the call of a party \"Whip\" to record their votes upon\r\nImperial concerns of the greatest importance. And though it must be\r\nadmitted that it is rare indeed for the incompetent or degenerate\r\nmembers of the Upper House to take any part in its deliberations, the\r\nfact that they have the undoubted right to do so scarcely tends to\r\nenhance the respect in which that assembly is popularly held. In\r\nspite, however, of the occasional presence of \"undesirables,\" it is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that if any question arises requiring a display\r\nof more than ordinary knowledge of history, or more practical wisdom\r\nor learning, these can nowhere be found so well as in the Upper House.\r\nThere, too, the level of oratory and of common sense is perceptibly\r\nhigher than in the popular assembly. But the Reform Bill of 1832\r\nenabled the Commons to speak in the name of the people, which they had\r\nnever hitherto done, and which the Lords cannot do, and thus created\r\nthat wide gulf which now separates them from the House of Lords. Here,\r\nhowever, as well as there, are many men who realise that, in the words\r\nof Lord Rosebery, they have a great heritage, \"their own honour, and\r\nthe honour of their ancestors, and of their posterity, to guard.\"[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] Hansard, vol. 289, p. 957 (1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Witenagemot, as we have already seen, was essentially an\r\naristocratic assembly. The populace sometimes attended its meetings,\r\nbut, beyond expressing their feelings by shouts of approval, took no\r\npart in its deliberations. For many years after the Conquest the\r\nPeople continued to be unrepresented in the Great Council of the\r\nnation, though they were still present as spectators. From 1066 until\r\nabout 1225, says Blackstone, the Lords were the only legislators.\r\nAfter the latter date the Commons were occasionally summoned, and in\r\n1265 they formed a regular part of the legislature. Then for the first\r\ntime did the counties of England return two knights, and the boroughs\r\nand cities two deputies each, to represent them in Parliament.\r\nSeventy-four knights from all the English counties except Chester,\r\nDurham, and Monmouth,[55] and about two hundred burgesses and\r\ncitizens, sat in the Parliament of Edward I.; but it was not until the\r\nreign of his successor that any attempt was made to form a\r\nconstitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe Three Estates in those days sat in the same Chamber, but did not\r\njoin in debate. The Lords made the laws, and the Commons looked on or\r\nperhaps assented respectfully. The separation of the two Houses took\r\nplace in the reign of Edward III., when the knights threw in their\r\nallegiance with the burgesses, and in 1322 the Lower House[56] first\r\nmet apart.\r\n\r\n  [55] Durham, both County and City, was not enfranchised until 1673,\r\n  and Monmouth was regarded as a Welsh County.\r\n\r\n  [56] \"The House of Commons is called the Lower House in twenty Acts of\r\n  Parliament,\" says Selden. \"But what are twenty Acts of Parliament\r\n  amongst friends?\"--\"Table Talk,\" p. 36.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Commons increased gradually as time advanced. By the\r\nend of the thirteenth century they had secured sufficient authority to\r\nensure that no tax could be imposed without their consent. By the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth no law could be passed unless they approved.\r\nBut many centuries were yet to elapse before the chief government of\r\nthe country passed into their hands.\r\n\r\nThe expense of sending representatives to Parliament was long\r\nconsidered a burden, many counties and boroughs applying to be\r\ndischarged from the exercise of so costly a privilege. The electors of\r\nthose days were apparently less anxious to furnish a Member for the\r\npopular assembly than to save the payment of his salary. Indeed, the\r\ncity of Rochester, in 1411, practised the frugal custom of compelling\r\nany stranger who settled within its gates to serve a term in\r\nParliament at his own expense. He was thus permitted to earn his\r\nfreedom, and the parsimonious citizens saved an annual expenditure of\r\nabout £9.[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] \"Quarterly Review,\" vol. xxix. p. 63.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual growth of parliamentary power the importance of\r\nelecting members to the House of Commons began to be recognized, and,\r\nduring the Wars of the Roses, fewer and fewer applications were made\r\nby boroughs and cities anxious to be relieved of this duty.\r\n\r\nUntil Henry VI.'s time, when the modern system of Bills and Statutes\r\nbegan to come into being, legislation was by Petition. The control of\r\nParliament was still very largely in the hands of the Crown, and\r\nsuccessive sovereigns took care that their influence over the Commons\r\nshould be maintained. With this object in view Edward VI. enfranchised\r\nsome two-and-twenty rotten boroughs, Mary added fourteen more, and in\r\nElizabeth's time sixty-two further members, all under the royal\r\ncontrol, were sent to leaven the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe attendance in the Lower House was still poor, not more than two\r\nhundred members ever taking part in the largest divisions, and it was\r\nonly at the culmination of the conflicts between Parliament and the\r\nStuart Kings that the Commons began to display a real desire for\r\nindependent power.\r\n\r\nIf the Revolution of 1688 firmly and finally established the supremacy\r\nof Parliament, it was only a supremacy over the Crown. The democratic\r\nelement to which we are accustomed in a modern House of Commons was\r\nstill conspicuously lacking. Both Houses remained purely aristocratic\r\nin character until long after this. Whigs and Tories might wrangle\r\nover political differences; they were at one in their determination to\r\nuphold the interests of a single privileged class. \"This House is not\r\nthe representative of the people of Great Britain,\" said Pitt in the\r\nCommons in 1783; \"it is the representative of nominal boroughs, of\r\nruined and exterminated towns, of noble families, of wealthy\r\nindividuals, of foreign potentates.\" Eight members of Parliament were\r\nthen nominated by the Nabob of Arcot, and in 1793 the Duke of\r\nNorfolk's nominees in the House numbered eleven. The Crown, the\r\nChurch, and the aristocracy governed the country. The Commons were an\r\ninsignificant body, open to bribery, dependent upon rich patrons or\r\nupon electors whose corruption was notorious. Prior to 1832, only 170\r\nout of some 658 members of Parliament were independent; the remainder\r\nwere nominated by wealthy individuals. The Reform Bill of 1832,\r\nhowever, brought about a mighty change for the better. The electorate\r\nof the country was raised from 300,000 to 1,370,000. Fifty-six corrupt\r\nboroughs were disfranchised, thirty-one were deprived of one member\r\neach, and two others were reduced; and the hitherto inadequate\r\nrepresentation of other towns and boroughs was rectified.\r\n\r\nThe Reformed Parliament that met in the following year differed in\r\nmany respects from its predecessors. Sir Robert Peel was much struck\r\nby the alteration in tone, character, and appearance of the new House\r\nof Commons. \"There was an asperity, a rudeness, a vulgar assumption\r\nof independence, combined with a fawning reference to the people out\r\nof doors, expressed by many of the new members, which\" (as he told his\r\nfriend Raikes) \"was highly disgusting.\"[58] The Duke of Wellington,\r\nwho had gone to the Peers' Gallery of the House of Commons to inspect\r\nthe new Parliament, expressed his opinion more tersely. \"I never saw\r\nso many shocking bad hats in my life!\" he said. The spirit of\r\ndemocracy had crept in, but it was still an unwelcome visitor. For\r\nmany years the aristocracy maintained a great preponderance in the\r\nHouse of Commons--in 1868 that assembly comprised 45 heirs of\r\npeerages, 65 younger sons of peers, and 57 baronets[59]--but its power\r\ndecreased year by year, though even now it cannot be said to be wholly\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n  [58] Raikes's \"Journal,\" vol. i. p. 157.\r\n\r\n  [59] \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" December 28, 1860.\r\n\r\nBy the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 the franchise qualifications were\r\nonce more extended, and three and a half million names added to the\r\nregister. With the election, in 1874, of the first Labour\r\ncandidates--of whom one, at least, was a genuine working-man--the\r\nCommons gradually began to assume that representative appearance which\r\nit now presents.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three centuries the Lower House has increased very\r\nconsiderably in size as well as in importance. It numbered 300 in the\r\nreign of Henry VI., and 506 at the time of the Long Parliament. In\r\n1832, by which time the Acts of Union had added 45 Scottish and 100\r\nIrish members,[60] the numbers had risen to 658, and to-day some 670\r\nmembers sit in Parliament.\r\n\r\n  [60] The Irish members were increased to 105 in 1832, but subsequently\r\n  reduced to 103, fifty years later.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has long ago shaken off the shackles of the\r\nCrown, and will perhaps some day be almost as wholly emancipated from\r\nthe influence of the aristocracy. Its power is increasing yearly,\r\nowing mainly to the fact that it has gained the confidence of the\r\ncountry, and it is now generally felt that when any great question\r\narises, the House will solve it, as Disraeli said some fifty years\r\nago, \"not merely by the present thought and intelligence of its\r\nmembers, but by the accumulated wisdom of the eminent men who have\r\npreceded them.\"[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Hansard, \"Debates,\" 18 April, 1864.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the exact nature of those inducements which tempt a man\r\nto enter Parliament must often prove perplexing to the lay mind. To\r\nCharles James Fox the pleasures of patronage seemed the circumstances\r\nwhich chiefly rendered desirable the possession of political power.\r\nBut the patronage in the hands of a private member to-day is of too\r\ninsignificant a nature to prove an irresistible temptation, and\r\npolitical power of an appreciable kind is reserved for the very few.\r\n\r\nThe life of the modern legislator is a strenuous and an expensive one;\r\nit cannot be successfully undertaken by a poor or an idle man. Before\r\na candidate may stand for Parliament at all he must deposit a\r\nsubstantial sum with the Returning Officer, and the mere expenses of\r\nelection vary from £350 to £900 in boroughs, and from £650 to as much\r\nas £1800 in counties.[62] Add to this the annual sum--variously\r\ncomputed at from £200 to £500--which a member spends in subscriptions\r\nwithin his constituency, and it can readily be imagined that the\r\nparliamentary life is not open to all. There would, indeed, seem to be\r\nsome justification for the criticism of that cynical member who said\r\nthat he had often heard the House of Commons called \"the best club in\r\nLondon,\" and supposed that it was so termed because it demanded the\r\nlargest entrance fee.[63] A few fortunate candidates have their\r\nelection expenses paid by a party or by Trades Unions, but these are\r\nin the minority, and the comparatively large cost of entering\r\nParliament is the chief reason why, in spite of the democratic\r\ntendency of modern political thought, the House of Commons still\r\nremains in large measure a delegation of the richest if not perhaps of\r\nthe most aristocratic class in England. This state of things is likely\r\nto continue unless some system is adopted of remunerating the services\r\nof legislators in the fashion which long prevailed in England and is\r\nstill in vogue upon the Continent. But it is certainly open to\r\nargument whether its adoption would improve the quality of the House\r\nor the respect entertained for it in the country.\r\n\r\n  [62] The General Election of 1880 cost £1,700,000. This expenditure\r\n  was reduced to about a million pounds after the passing of the Corrupt\r\n  and Illegal Practices Prevention Act and the Redistribution Bill of\r\n  1883 and 1885. By the former the expenses in boroughs are limited to\r\n  £350, if the number of electors does not exceed 2000; and to £380 if\r\n  it does exceed 2000, with an extra £30 for every further 1000\r\n  electors. In counties, where the electors do not exceed 2000, the\r\n  expenses are limited to £650, and to £710 if they exceed 2000, with an\r\n  extra £60 for every further 1000 electors. These sums do not include\r\n  personal expenses up to £100 and the charges of the returning officer.\r\n\r\n  [63] Hansard, \"Debates,\" vol. 288, p. 1563. (5 June, 1884.) (The\r\n  phrase was first used in a novel entitled, \"Friends of Bohemia, or\r\n  Phases of London Life,\" published in 1857, by a Parliamentary writer\r\n  named E. M. Whitty.)\r\n\r\nIn the Parliaments of Edward III. members received regular payment,\r\nthe wages varying from year to year. At the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, for example, the knights of Dorsetshire were paid\r\n5_s._ a day; later on this was reduced to 1_s._ 6_d._ In 1314 the\r\ndaily wage of county members was 4_s._, and they were also allowed a\r\nsmall sum to cover travelling expenses. In Henry VIII.'s reign\r\nboroughs were expected to pay their own members' expenses. Frugal\r\nconstituencies occasionally bargained with their would-be\r\nrepresentatives, and candidates, stimulated to generous impulses by\r\nthe idea of imminent election, would agree to defray their own\r\nexpenses or even to go without wages altogether. Sometimes, too,\r\nmembers appear to have been willing to pay for the privilege of\r\nelection. In 1571 a certain Thomas Long was returned for the Wiltshire\r\nborough of Westbury by the simple process of paying the mayor a sum of\r\n£4. Long's unfitness for a seat in Parliament--he was a simple\r\nyeoman--became apparent as soon as he entered the House. On being\r\nquestioned, he admitted having bribed the constituency to elect him,\r\nand was at once informed that the House had no further need of his\r\nservices. The inhabitants of Westbury were fined £20, and the Mayor\r\nwas compelled to refund his money.[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] \"Parliamentary History,\" vol. i. p. 766.\r\n\r\nThe practice of paying members long continued. In the year 1586 we\r\nfind the member for Grantham suing the borough for his salary. The\r\nHouse of Commons does not, however, appear to have been anxious to\r\nuphold this claim, and requested that it should be withdrawn. By this\r\ntime, indeed, it had become usual for members to forego the financial\r\nadvantages of election--though there still remained some notable\r\nexceptions who were not satisfied with the honorary rewards attaching\r\nto the possession of a seat in Parliament--and in 1677 the Commons\r\nrepealed the Statute by which wages were paid to members.[65]\r\n\r\n  [65] Andrew Marvell continued to receive a salary from Hull until his\r\n  death in 1678 (see his \"Works,\" vol. ii., xxxv.), and the member for\r\n  Harwich obtained a writ against that borough for his salary in 1681.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys deplored the gradual neglect of the old practice\r\nrequiring constituencies to allow wages to their representatives,\r\nwhereby, he said, \"they chose men that understood their business and\r\nwould attend it, and they could expect an account from, which now they\r\ncannot.\"[66] But this view was not the popular one, and electors\r\ngladly availed themselves of the change in public opinion to\r\ndiscontinue the earlier system. Motions have been brought forward on\r\nmore than one occasion, \"to restore the ancient constitutional custom\r\nof payment of members,\"--notably in 1870 and 1888--but have always\r\nbeen rejected by a large majority.[67] Nowadays, however, there seems\r\nsome inclination to revert to the old-fashioned and more expensive\r\nmethod, and within recent years a Liberal Prime Minister has promised\r\nto provide payment for members whenever funds for the purpose are\r\navailable. In other respects the desire of the member of Parliament\r\ntoday would appear to be rather in the direction of relinquishing than\r\nof adding to his personal privileges. In the eighteenth century, for\r\nexample, he would never have dreamt of paying postal fees. Members\r\ntransmitted their correspondence without charge by the simple process\r\nof inscribing their names in one corner of the envelope. The privilege\r\nof \"franking,\" as this was called, was afterwards limited by its being\r\nrequired that the date and place of posting should be added in the\r\nmember's handwriting, and the daily number of free letters was\r\nrestricted to ten sent and fifteen received. In those free and easy\r\ndays kind-hearted members would provide their friends with large\r\nbundles of franked half-sheets of paper, and the number of persons who\r\npaid any postage on their correspondence two hundred years ago must\r\nhave been very small indeed. In a letter written by Mrs. Delany to a\r\nfriend in 1749 we find the subject mentioned in a way that shows how\r\nuniversally available had become such opportunities for defrauding the\r\nrevenue. \"I have been so silly as to forget franks,\" she writes. \"I\r\nmust beg the favour of you to get _a dozen or two_ for me from Sir\r\nCharles Mordaunt.... I don't know,\" she adds, \"but you will find a few\r\nof the Duke of Portland's in the drawer with the paper.\"[68]\r\n\r\n  [66] \"Diary,\" 30 March, 1668.\r\n\r\n  [67] Irving's \"Annals of Our Time,\" p. 912.

Covers were transmitted by the\r\nhundred, packed in boxes, the only limit to their distribution being\r\nthe good nature of members. A London banker once received thirty-three\r\ncovers containing garden seeds from a Scottish member, and it became\r\napparent to the postal authorities that some effort must be made to\r\nput a stop to the practice.[69] This was eventually done in 1840, not\r\nwithout a struggle, and the modern member of Parliament who writes\r\nletters to his friends must do so at his own expense. He is still,\r\nhowever, allowed to send a certain number of printed copies of bills\r\nto his constituents, free of charge, by writing his name in a corner\r\nof the packet.\r\n\r\n  [69] Wraxall's \"Posthumous Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day the privileges of membership are certainly not of a material\r\nkind. A few men enter the House of Commons for social purposes, and\r\nmust be sadly disappointed in the result. The simple letters, \"M.P.\"\r\non a card are indeed no longer, as the author of that entertaining\r\nwork, \"Men and Manners in Parliament,\" declared them to be thirty\r\nyears ago, \"the surest passport to distinction for mediocrity\r\ntravelling on the continent.\"[70] Bitter experience has shattered the\r\nsimple faith in human nature which was once the chief charm of the\r\nSwiss innkeeper. The sight of a British member of Parliament signing a\r\ncheque no longer inspires him with confidence. He is only too well\r\naware that among those--\r\n\r\n    \"Types of the elements whose glorious strife\r\n    Form'd this free England, and still guard her life,\"\r\n\r\nthere exist a few who are not above leaving their hotel bills\r\npermanently unpaid; and this knowledge has endowed him with a caution\r\nwhich is both galling to the sensitive soul of the average M.P. and\r\nextremely inconvenient to the tourist who has momentarily mislaid his\r\nletter of credit.\r\n\r\n  [70] p. 270.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the member cannot now enjoy the unmixed respect of the foreigner,\r\nit is equally certain that at home he is no longer looked upon with\r\nthe veneration with which his predecessors were commonly regarded. His\r\nconstituents treat him as their servant no less than as their\r\nrepresentative. And though he may find some comfort in that definition\r\nof a member's duties for which Edmund Burke is responsible--which\r\nperhaps cost that statesman his seat at the General Election of\r\n1780--this will prove but a slight consolation when he is suddenly\r\ncalled upon by his local committee to explain some change of views or\r\nto account for constant neglect of his parliamentary duties.\r\n\r\nParliament is not, indeed, as Burke told the electors of Bristol, a\r\ncongress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which\r\ninterests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other\r\nagents and advocates. It is a deliberate assembly of one nation, with\r\none interest, that of the whole; where not local purposes, not local\r\nprejudices, ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the\r\ngeneral reason of the whole. \"You choose a member indeed,\" he said;\r\n\"but when you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol, but he\r\nis a member of _Parliament_.\"[71] At the same time a member cannot\r\nafford to forget that he owes much to his constituents; his existence\r\nin Parliament depends very greatly upon their good pleasure. He must\r\nbe to a certain extent at their beck and call, willing to subscribe to\r\ntheir local charities, to open their bazaars, visit their hospitals,\r\nkick off at their football matches, take the chair at their farmers'\r\ndinners or smoking-concerts. He must have a welcome hand ever extended\r\nin the direction of the squire, a smile for the licensed victualler, a\r\nkindly nod of the head for the meanest elector, and (at election\r\ntimes) a kiss for the humblest voter's stickiest child. When\r\nconstituents call upon him at the House he must greet them with a\r\ndisplay of effusiveness which gives no hint of his annoyance at being\r\ninterrupted in the middle of important business. They may want to be\r\nshown round the House, and such a natural desire on their part must be\r\nacquiesced in, though it is not every one who has the courage to\r\nescort a band of six hundred constituents round the Chamber, as did a\r\nmember in 1883. Every morning the postman will bring him--besides that\r\nvoluminous bundle of parliamentary papers and bluebooks, with the\r\ncontents of which he is mythically supposed to make himself\r\nacquainted--a score of applications of various kinds from his\r\nconstituents, all of which must be attended to. The day is long past\r\nwhen he can emulate the cavalier methods of Fox who, as Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs, affixed a notice to the door of his office:\r\n\"No letters received here on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays,\r\nFridays or Saturdays! and none answered on any day!\"[72]\r\n\r\n  [71] Speech at Bristol in 1774. (\"Works and Correspondence of E.\r\n  Burke,\" vol. iii. p. 236). Algernon Sidney anticipated this remark.\r\n  \"It is not therefore for Kent or Sussex, Lewes or Maidstone, but for\r\n  the whole nation, that the members chosen in those places are sent to\r\n  serve in Parliament.\"--\"Discourse Concerning Government,\" vol. ii. p.\r\n  370.\r\n\r\n  [72] Bell's \"Biographical Sketches,\" p. 82.\r\n\r\nThe modern member's duties are by no means confined to the House of\r\nCommons, nor are they limited to the duration of the session. Formerly\r\nit would never have occurred to a member to make a speech in his\r\nconstituency, once he was elected; though as a candidate he would of\r\ncourse address the voters, and might even be compelled to attend a\r\nbanquet or a provincial dance.[73] The idea of paying a visit to the\r\nelectors of any constituency other than his own would, a century ago,\r\nhave been considered in the worst possible taste. Nowadays, however,\r\nthe point of view is changed. No sooner has he completed his share in\r\nthe arduous work of the session--the long tedious hours of debate, the\r\nwearisome attendance on committees, the continual tramping through the\r\ndivision lobbies--and shaken the dust of Westminster from his feet,\r\nthan he must hasten to the country to give some account of his\r\nstewardship, to dazzle his constituents with the oratorical platitudes\r\nwhich have failed to move the more fastidious audience of the House of\r\nCommons. He must even be ready to rush off to the assistance of a\r\nfellow-member in some distant shire, and purge his bosom of the same\r\nperilous stuff upon various platforms all over the country.\r\n\r\n  [73] Croker, in 1820, complains of having to attend a three o'clock\r\n  dinner and dance at Bodmin, when he stood as candidate; the whole\r\n  affair being, he says, \"at once tiresome and foolish.\" \"Croker\r\n  Papers,\" vol. i. p. 166.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Coke declared three hundred years ago that every member of\r\nParliament should in three respects at least resemble the elephant;\r\n\"first, that he hath no gall; secondly, that he is inflexible, and\r\ncannot bow; thirdly, that he is of a most ripe and perfect\r\nmemory.\"[74] He might well have added some of the other qualities of\r\nthat admirable beast--patience, docility, the capacity for hard work,\r\nand, above all, a thick skin. Though outwardly inflexible, a modern\r\nmember must be prepared to bow to the wishes of his party; and in his\r\nripe and perfect memory there should be room for the names and faces\r\nof his constituents and their wives. He must be patient when he has\r\nfailed for the hundredth time to \"catch the Speaker's eye\"; he must be\r\ndocile when the Whip urges him to vote in favour of a motion with\r\nwhich he disagrees fundamentally; and if he be of a thin-skinned\r\ndisposition or of a delicate constitution, the labours of the House of\r\nCommons may soon prove too much for him. If he is unambitious and\r\nanxious to lead a peaceful life, he will do well to remember the\r\nadvice given by Ferguson of Pitfour, who summed up his parliamentary\r\nexperiences, in 1826, as follows: \"I was never present at any debate I\r\ncould avoid, or absent from any division I could get at. I have heard\r\nmany arguments which convinced my judgment, but never one that\r\ninfluenced my vote. I never voted but once according to my own\r\nopinion, and that was the worst vote I ever gave. I found that the\r\nonly way to be quiet in Parliament was always to vote with the\r\nMinistry, and never to take a place.\"[75]\r\n\r\n  [74] \"Institute of the Laws of England,\" 4th part, p. 3.\r\n\r\n  [75] Sir H. C. Robinson's \"Diary and Reminiscences,\" vol. ii. pp.\r\n  315-6.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the member of Parliament enjoys many privileges which are\r\ndenied to the mere layman. He is stimulated by the excitement of\r\nparticipating in a perpetual political conflict; he delights in the\r\nintellectual pleasure of hearing the most interesting questions of the\r\nday debated by the shrewdest men of the age; he is conscious of being\r\nin a sense a public benefactor, with a direct (if somewhat slight)\r\ninfluence upon the policy of his country. He is given a front seat in\r\nwhat Mr. Biggar once called the \"best theatre in London,\" and there is\r\nalways the chance that some day he may himself be cast for a leading\r\npart in that great political drama which is performed night after\r\nnight on the boards of the Theatre Royal, Westminster. Politics--\"l'art\r\nde mentir à propos,\" as Voltaire defined them--may have their origin\r\nin the perversity rather than in the grandeur of the human soul, but\r\nthe attraction they exercise over the average Englishman is very\r\ngreat.[76] But for the privileges of a parliamentary career--one of\r\nthe worthiest to which a patriot can devote himself, in Mr. Balfour's\r\nopinion--a heavy price has to be paid, and to the toll of toil and\r\ntreasure levied by Parliament must be added the sacrifice of\r\nindependence as well as of time.\r\n\r\n  [76] Moore wrote to Lady Donegal in 1807: \"I begin at last to find out\r\n  that _politics_ is the only thing minded in this country, and that it\r\n  is better even to _rebel_ against government than have nothing to do\r\n  with it.\" \"Memoirs,\" vol. i. p. 225.\r\n\r\nIn this twentieth century the initiative of the private member has\r\nalmost disappeared. The Government is alone responsible for\r\nlegislation; all the most important measures brought in are Government\r\nmeasures. The time of the House is placed, very early in each session,\r\nat the disposal of the Government, its business is arranged to suit\r\ntheir convenience, and the private member must be content to make the\r\nmost of such fragmentary opportunities as are flung to him. He is\r\ncontrolled by his party and by his Whip; he may not leave the House\r\nwithout permission; he must vote at the word of command. At one moment\r\nhe may be called upon to speak at length upon a subject of which he is\r\nsublimely ignorant, in order to allow his party a chance of gathering\r\ntheir forces to meet an unexpected division; at another he is\r\ncompelled to refrain from good words, though it may be pain and grief\r\nto him, in order to save the precious time of the Government. And\r\nperhaps he will occasionally be inclined to agree once more with Burke\r\nthat the same qualifications, nowadays, make a good member of\r\nParliament that formerly made a good monk: \"Bene loqui de superiore,\r\nlegere breviarum taliter qualiter, et sinere res vadere ut vadunt\"--to\r\nspeak well of the minister, read the lesson he sets you, and let the\r\nState take care of itself![77]\r\n\r\n  [77] Prior's \"Life of Burke,\" vol. ii. p. 454.\r\n\r\nEven so, the advantages of membership are not to be despised; and once\r\na man has tasted the sweets of political life, all other professions\r\nfade into insignificance. He may have been moved to enter Parliament\r\nby some ambitious yearning after fame; he may have been prompted by\r\npatriotic motives, or merely the desire to prove himself a useful\r\nmember of society, his serious opinion being (like that of Buxton, the\r\ngreat opponent of Slavery) that \"good woodcock-shooting is a\r\npreferable thing to glory.\"[78] His contributions to debate may be of\r\npoor quality, but they will not be altogether valueless, and, after an\r\narduous day in the House, he will listen with a glow of conscious\r\nrectitude to the ancient and welcome cry of \"Who goes Home?\" which\r\nrings through the lobbies and announces the close of the sitting.[79]\r\nThough he may never, perhaps, wake to find himself famous, he will\r\noften sink comfortably to sleep on his return home from the House in\r\nthe early hours of the morning, soothed by the consciousness of duty\r\ndone. That in itself is a thing not to be despised, and there may\r\npossibly be other benefits in store for him. If he is sufficiently\r\npainstaking and intelligent he may perchance have greatness thrust\r\nupon him in the form of an under-secretaryship, and, when he has\r\nscaled the outer breastworks of that Cabinet zareba to which access is\r\nso difficult, the suspicion that he has long cherished of being a\r\nheaven-born politician is at length confirmed.\r\n\r\n  [78] Buxton's \"Memoirs,\" p. 154.\r\n\r\n  [79] In olden days members used to return from Westminster to London\r\n  through lanes infested with robbers. This cry enabled them to assemble\r\n  and leave the House in one another's company.\r\n\r\nSocrates was right when he said that whereas no man undertook a trade\r\nthat he had not thoroughly learnt, everybody considered himself\r\nsufficiently qualified by nature to undertake the trade of government,\r\nprobably the most difficult in the world. There are, however, certain\r\ndisqualifications which prevent the most ambitious man from serving in\r\nParliament.[80]\r\n\r\n  [80] It is curious to reflect that a man may be a member of Parliament\r\n  even though he is not entitled to a vote as an elector. The Rt. Hon.\r\n  Austen Chamberlain was not only a member, but even a Cabinet Minister,\r\n  at a time when he had no vote.\r\n\r\nInfants and minors may not be elected to the House of Commons. But\r\nthough they have always been excluded by custom or statute, their\r\npresence was winked at until the end of the eighteenth century. The\r\nmembers of those bygone times seem generally to have been more\r\nyouthful than the members of to-day. Even the Chair was occupied by\r\nmen comparatively young, Seymour, Harley, and Sir Thomas More each\r\nbeing elected Speaker before he had reached the age of forty. The\r\nlast-named speaks of himself as a \"beardless boy resisting greybeards\r\nand Kings themselves,\" referring no doubt to the time when Cardinal\r\nWolsey came to the House of Commons in 1523, to ask for money for his\r\nroyal master, and he actively opposed the grant.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Elizabeth's time the Lower Chamber was not weakened by the\r\nadmission of too many infants; but during the reign of James I. the\r\nancient custom for old men to make laws for young ones seems to have\r\nbeen inverted, there being as many as forty members of Parliament who\r\nwere minors, and several who were not more than sixteen years old.[81]\r\nThe poet Waller sat in the Commons before he was seventeen, while Lord\r\nTorrington (afterwards Duke of Albemarle) took part in debate when he\r\nwas only fourteen, and at that age addressed the House in 1667, on the\r\nsubject of Clarendon's impeachment.[82] The infant members of that day\r\nwere singularly precocious and well able to look after themselves.\r\nWhen, for instance, some one urged that Lord Falkland was too young to\r\nsit in Parliament, as he had not yet sown his wild oats, that young\r\nnobleman rudely replied that he could imagine no more suitable place\r\nfor sowing them than the House of Commons, where there were so many\r\ngeese to pick them up.[83]\r\n\r\n  [81] Naunton's \"Fragmenta Regalia,\" p. 21.\r\n\r\n  [82] Shaftesbury's \"Life,\" vol. i. p. 30 n.\r\n\r\n  [83] Townsend's \"History,\" vol. ii. p. 400.\r\n\r\nThe Crown saw no disadvantage in having youthful legislators, who\r\ncould all the more easily be influenced. When Parliament assembled in\r\n1661 and the tender age of many of the members was pointed out to King\r\nCharles, he answered that he found no great fault in that, \"for he\r\ncould keep them till they got beards.\"[84] By the Act of 1695,\r\nhowever, infants were formally excluded from Parliament, but for a\r\nlong time they continued to sit in the House, though they most\r\nprobably abstained from voting.\r\n\r\n  [84] Reresby's \"Memoirs,\" p. 51.\r\n\r\nExtreme youth was not considered a bar to parliamentary success in\r\ndays when it was possible for a politician to become Prime Minister,\r\nas Pitt did, at the age of twenty-five, though that statesman's father\r\nfound it necessary on one occasion to defend himself against the\r\ncharge of immaturity.[85] Both Fox and Philip Stanhope (afterwards\r\nLord Chesterfield) delivered their maiden speeches a month or so\r\nbefore they came of age,[86] and Lord John Russell was returned to\r\nParliament when he was still a minor.\r\n\r\n  [85] \"Sir,\" he said in debate, \"the atrocious crime of being a young\r\n  man, which the hon. gentleman (Horace Walpole) has with such decency\r\n  and spirit charged against me, I shall neither attempt to palliate or\r\n  deny; but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose\r\n  follies may cease with their youth, and not of that number who are\r\n  ignorant in spite of experience.\"\r\n\r\n  [86] Chesterfield's \"Letters,\" vol. ii. p. 339. In order to escape the\r\n  fine of £500 Chesterfield retired from political life for a short\r\n  time.\r\n\r\nAs the years advanced the House of Commons became more and more\r\nparticular in this respect, and at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury an eye-witness was struck by the large proportion of\r\nbald-headed men--nearly a third of the whole number--in the Lower\r\nChamber.[87] To-day no one who has not reached the mature age of\r\ntwenty-one can stand for Parliament, much less sit upon the sacred\r\ngreen benches.\r\n\r\n  [87] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 62.\r\n\r\nLunatics and idiots are also disentitled to parliamentary election. A\r\nmember who goes mad after having taken his seat can only be removed,\r\nhowever, if his case is proved to be a hopeless one, the House being\r\nthen petitioned to declare the seat vacant, and the Speaker issuing a\r\nnew writ. In one well-known instance a committee of the House found\r\nthat a member's lunacy was not so incurable as to justify his removal,\r\nand he retained his seat. In 1881 the case of a lunatic recording his\r\nvote in a division was the occasion of a painful and futile debate.\r\nThe member in question suffered from periodical bouts of insanity, and\r\nhad recently been certified \"dangerous\" at his own request, in order\r\nthat he might retire temporarily to an asylum. It was therefore\r\nobviously improper for him to vote. The House, however, declined to\r\ntake any serious notice of the incident, the motion for an inquiry by\r\na Select Committee into the circumstances of the case being negatived,\r\nand the matter tactfully allowed to drop.[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] See Hansard, vol. clxii. p. 1941.\r\n\r\nAliens cannot sit in Parliament until they have taken the precaution\r\nof becoming naturalised British subjects. In William III.'s time all\r\npersons born outside the dominions were disqualified, and when the\r\nTest and Corporation Acts were repealed in George IV.'s reign, an\r\namendment was inserted by the Bishop of Llandaff in the House of Lords\r\nby which Jews were excluded from Parliament. They were finally\r\nadmitted to the House of Commons in 1858, and during the reign of\r\nQueen Victoria naturalisation was held to carry with it full political\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nEnglish and Scottish peers are incapacitated from serving in the\r\nCommons. Irish peers, however, may do so, provided that they are not\r\nalready sitting as representative peers in the House of Lords.[89] The\r\neldest sons of peers were excluded from the Lower House down to the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, when they were gratefully admitted\r\nand given seats of honour on the front bench with the Privy\r\nCouncillors.\r\n\r\n  [89] When the Lords were temporarily abolished in 1648, peers were\r\n  elected to the Commons, but only a few seem to have availed themselves\r\n  of this privilege. Porritt's \"Unreformed House of Commons,\" vol. i. p.\r\n  123.\r\n\r\nIrishmen enjoy parliamentary privileges not only as peers but also as\r\nbankrupts. The occasional combination of the two therefore carries\r\nwith it some slight compensation. A bankrupt Englishman or Scotsman is\r\ndisabled from even standing as a candidate for Parliament, whereas his\r\nmore fortunate Irish brother may be elected. Members of Parliament who\r\nbecome bankrupt after election may continue to sit and vote in the\r\nCommons until the Speaker has received official notification of their\r\nbankruptcy, or the House has ordered their withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThe election of clergymen and other ministers was prohibited by an Act\r\nof 1801, passed in order to deal with the case of the Rev. J. Horne\r\nTooke, the \"Father of Radicalism,\" who had been elected for Old Sarum.\r\nIt did not succeed in its object, however, for he continued to sit for\r\nthe remainder of the Parliament.[90] And by another Act, passed about\r\n1870, any one who has relinquished the office of priest or deacon is\r\neligible for election. Otherwise no minister of the Established Church\r\nmay sit in Parliament.\r\n\r\n  [90] Horne Tooke was a man of strength and determination. Upon all\r\n  great public questions, as he once declared, \"neither friends nor\r\n  foes, nor life nor death, nor thunder nor lightning, would ever make\r\n  him give way the breadth of one hair.\" When Lord Temple claimed a\r\n  superior right to sit in Parliament because he had \"a stake in the\r\n  country,\" \"So have I,\" said Tooke, \"but it was not stolen from a\r\n  public hedge!\"\r\n\r\nMany other persons are similarly debarred, among whom may be mentioned\r\nthe holders of offices under the Crown created since 1705, Crown\r\npensioners (exclusive of civil servants and diplomats), and Government\r\ncontractors. Persons guilty of treason or felony (who have neither\r\nserved their sentence nor been pardoned), or of corrupt practices at\r\nelections are likewise disqualified,[91] as are also those who are\r\nunable to take the Oath of Allegiance or to affirm. There are,\r\nbesides, a number of officials connected with the administration of\r\njustice, or concerned with the collection of the Revenue, or\r\nrepresentatives of the Crown--judges, colonial governors, etc.--who\r\nare incapacitated by their positions from sitting in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n  [91] In 1558 it was voted by a small majority that one outlawed or\r\n  guilty of various frauds might sit in the House if duly elected, his\r\n  crimes being apparently purged by virtue of his election. See Raikes's\r\n  \"English Constitution,\" vol. i. p. 323.\r\n\r\nAt one period of parliamentary history lawyers were excluded from the\r\nHouse of Commons, enactments in favour of keeping out \"gentlemen of\r\nthe long robe\" being passed in Edward III.'s time. They were always\r\nunpopular members, it being supposed that they only entered Parliament\r\nas a stepping-stone to wider practice at the Bar or to some sort of\r\nGovernment employment. The legal profession was looked upon as one\r\ninto which no one entered without views of self-aggrandisement, and\r\nthe use of a seat in Parliament as a means of advertising oneself did\r\nnot appeal to the country at large.[92] Lawyers are allowed to sit in\r\nthe House to-day, but they may not practise as counsel before\r\nParliamentary Committees, nor even advise professionally upon any\r\nprivate Bill.\r\n\r\n  [92] See the \"Black Book,\" p. 61.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully eluded all these disqualifications, paid a large\r\nsum for the privilege of serving his country, talked himself hoarse on\r\nthe platforms of his constituency, and finally been returned in\r\ntriumph to the House of Commons, the private member may consider\r\nhimself safely launched upon the parliamentary sea. It now remains to\r\nbe seen whether or not political life comes up to his expectations. If\r\nhe is energetic, ambitious, and eloquent he will find free scope for\r\nhis talents on the green benches at Westminster. He will be given a\r\nchance of proving his worth upon Select Committees. Here he can serve\r\nhis apprenticeship in preparation for that glorious day when he may be\r\ninspired to thrill and enrapture a delighted assembly with such an\r\noutburst of oratory as shall at once establish his claim to the\r\nconsideration of his party. Then indeed does Fortune seem ready to\r\nsmile upon the embryo statesman. In imagination he sees himself\r\nlounging upon the Treasury bench, his feet cocked up against the\r\nhistoric Table, while he writes a report of the debate for the\r\nedification of his Sovereign. To the political enthusiast the\r\nprospect is a rosy one. But alas! it is not every man who can aspire\r\nto the giddy heights of the front bench. After many a session of\r\nlaborious days and sleepless nights, after many a recess devoted to\r\nthe tiresome art known as \"nursing\" his constituency, after many\r\ndisappointments and trials, our member may still find himself at the\r\nbottom of the parliamentary ladder. Even if he ascends to what Mr.\r\nGladstone would have called \"measurable distance\" of the top, his\r\ntenure is precarious; in the defeat of a Government at a General\r\nElection he too may fall. And though his constituents remain loyal and\r\nhis seat secure, there arrives a day when he begins to weary of the\r\nslavery of parliamentary life, of the drudgery of a political career.\r\nLike Macaulay, he may at length come to define politics as a pursuit\r\nfrom which the most that those who are engaged in it can expect is\r\nthat by relinquishing liberal studies and social pleasures, by passing\r\nnights without sleep and summers without one glimpse of the beauty of\r\nnature, they may attain \"that laborious, that invidious, that closely\r\nwatched slavery which is mocked with the name of power.\"[93] When this\r\ntragic moment arrives, or when through physical infirmity, advancing\r\nyears, or penury, he wishes to bid a long farewell to the scene of his\r\nparliamentary labours, he has still a minor obstacle to contend with.\r\n\r\n  [93] \"Edinburgh Review\" (October, 1838), vol. lxviii. p. 114. The two\r\n  happiest days of a statesman's life are said to be the day when he\r\n  accepts high office and the day when he resigns it (Campbell's \"Lives\r\n  of the Chancellors,\" vol. i. p. 561). Lord Rosebery defined the\r\n  acceptance and resignation of office as \"the two supreme\r\n  pleasures--one ideal, the other real.\"\r\n\r\nA member cannot resign his seat, nor is it permissible for him to\r\nexchange it for any other. Only his own death or the dissolution of\r\nParliament can enable him to cease from being a member, unless the\r\nHouse itself declares his seat to be vacant. Even expulsion from the\r\nHouse does not prevent his immediate re-election by a constituency\r\ndetermined to retain his services, as was shown in the case of\r\nWalpole--twice expelled from the House, and re-elected by the voters\r\nof Lynn--and of Wilkes and Bradlaugh. The only thing that can prevent\r\na man from sitting in the House, or allow a member to escape from its\r\nservice, is the fact of his coming within the range of that long list\r\nof disqualifications already enumerated.\r\n\r\nHow then can a member vacate his seat in the simplest fashion? Many\r\nmembers would think twice before becoming bankrupt or committing a\r\nfelony in order to avoid parliamentary duty. It is not given to every\r\none to be a Colonial Governor, an Auditor General, or even a Charity\r\nCommissioner. But, by the merciful connivance of the powers that be,\r\nit is always possible for a member to incapacitate himself by holding\r\na Crown appointment. For this beneficent purpose two ancient\r\nstewardships of a purely nominal value are upheld, that by accepting\r\neither of these offices a member may be enabled to retire gracefully\r\nfrom Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe steward or bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke,\r\nDesborough and Boneham, and the steward of Northstead, were officers\r\nappointed by the Crown in past ages to look after certain\r\nBuckinghamshire forests in which brigands abounded. The brigands are\r\nlong since dead, and the forests themselves have been converted into\r\nparks and pasture lands, but the stewardships remain, a convenient\r\ncity of refuge for members who desire to escape from the active strife\r\nof Parliament, to whom they are sometimes presented as often as nine\r\ntimes in one session. \"The parliamentary constitution of England,\"\r\nsaid Disraeli, \"was born in the bosom of the Chiltern Hills; as to\r\nthis day our parliamentary career is terminated among its\r\nHundreds.\"[94] And since no county is fraught with greater historical\r\nand political interest than Buckinghamshire, it is perhaps fitting\r\nthat it should be the means of providing a merciful release for the\r\njaded parliamentarian whose course is run.\r\n\r\n  [94] Speech made to the farmers at Amersham Market, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament may be summoned to assemble wherever the king pleases.\r\nWestminster, the site of that royal palace which has sheltered so many\r\nEnglish sovereigns, from King Canute to Henry VIII., was for centuries\r\nthe most natural meeting-place for the Great Council of the nation.\r\nBut many another town, such as Winchester, Bury St. Edmunds,\r\nLeicester, Coventry, Reading, Salisbury, and half a dozen more, has at\r\ndifferent times been selected as the temporary seat of Parliament,\r\neither to suit the royal convenience, or for other reasons.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty Parliaments of Edward II. one met at Ripon, one at\r\nNorthampton, and three at York and Lincoln. In Stuart days Oxford was\r\nthe place chosen on two occasions, in 1625 and in 1665, when London\r\nwas being ravaged by the Plague. Since the Revolution of 1668,\r\nhowever, Parliament has ceased to be nomadic in its habits; in its old\r\nage it has definitely settled down at Westminster, and there it is\r\nlikely to remain.\r\n\r\nThe palace in which Canute first resided, within a stone's throw of\r\nthe Thames, was burnt to the ground somewhere about the year 1040.\r\nEdward the Confessor rebuilt it ten years later, and in the days of\r\nWilliam Rufus the addition of the Great Hall further enhanced the\r\ndignity of the palace. Here William held his first court, on his\r\nreturn from Normandy, and since his day a succession of kings have\r\nmade it the centre of innumerable scenes of royal pomp and pageantry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus was a man of large ideas. Even the magnificence of the\r\nGreat Hall did not entirely satisfy his taste for grandeur. In his\r\nimagination he had conceived a still more splendid scheme of\r\narchitecture, and was disappointed with the size of the new building.\r\nOn first entering to inspect it, accompanied by a large military\r\nretinue, he overheard some tactless persons remark that, in their\r\nopinion, the Hall was far too large. With a scornful look the King\r\nreduced these critics to silence, explaining that, so far from this\r\nbeing the case, the Hall was not half large enough, being, in fact,\r\nbut a bed-chamber in comparison with the building of which he intended\r\nit to form part.[95]\r\n\r\n  [95] Knight's \"London,\" vol. vi. p. 135.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the fourteenth century Westminster Hall had fallen into\r\ndisrepair, and during the reign of Richard II., when the poet Chaucer\r\nwas clerk of the works, it was rebuilt, the expense being met by a tax\r\nlevied upon all foreigners in the kingdom. Richard celebrated the\r\nevent by keeping Christmas there in a suitably seasonable fashion,\r\n\"with daily justings and runnings at tilt; whereunto resorted such a\r\nnumber of people that there was every day spent twenty-eight or\r\ntwenty-six oxen, and three hundred sheep, besides fowl without\r\nnumber.\"[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] Stow's \"A Survey of London,\" p. 173.\r\n\r\nPrior to the days when such feats of engineering as the building of\r\nthe modern Thames Embankment were possible, the proximity of the\r\nPalace to the river necessitated a system of constant repair. Until\r\nconfined within reasonable limits, the Thames showed a disposition to\r\noverflow its banks upon the slightest provocation, much to the\r\ninconvenience of the royal residents in the neighbourhood. In 1236 the\r\nPalace was completely flooded, so that \"men did row with wherries in\r\nthe midst of it,\" and six years later a similar fate befell\r\nWestminster Hall. In 1579 the river once more trespassed upon the\r\nroyal domain, fish being afterwards found in a moribund condition on\r\nthe floor of the Great Hall. The latter, indeed, continued to be\r\nvisited by periodical floods as late as the year 1841.\r\n\r\nFire, too, seems to have proved a constant menace to the safety of the\r\npalace, though at the time of the Fire of London the Great Hall was\r\none of the few places in which citizens could store their goods out of\r\nharm's way. In 1299 part of the palace was burnt to the ground, and at\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century so great a proportion of it\r\nfell a prey to a \"vehement conflagration\" that Henry VIII. decided to\r\nforsake it altogether, and removed his court to Whitehall. Since that\r\nday royal personages have ceased to lodge at the Palace of\r\nWestminster, which is still, however, nominally a royal residence, and\r\nas such remains in the custody of an officer of the King's\r\nhousehold.[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] The Lord Great Chamberlain, who holds an hereditary freehold\r\n  office of state, is the custodian of the Palace of Westminster. He was\r\n  originally an executive officer of the King's household, appointed to\r\n  look after the royal residence. In 1133 the office was granted by\r\n  Henry I. to Aubrey de Vere, father of the first Earl of Oxford, and to\r\n  his heirs. Henry VIII. gave the post on several occasions for life to\r\n  different favourites, not necessarily of the De Vere family, but since\r\n  the time of Elizabeth the Lord Great Chamberlainship has been held\r\n  without exception by descendants of the Earl of Oxford. To-day the\r\n  families of Cholmondeley on the one side, and Ancaster and Carrington\r\n  on the other, share the privileges of the office, a representative of\r\n  each branch holding the Chamberlainship in turn during the lifetime of\r\n  alternate sovereigns. The Lord Great Chamberlain retains authority\r\n  over the buildings of both Houses, even during the session, whenever\r\n  Parliament is not sitting. Here his official responsibilities end. In\r\n  former times a considerable part of his duties consisted in attending\r\n  his sovereign at the Coronation, when he was not only expected to\r\n  dress the King, to \"carry the coif, swords, and gloves, etc.\"; but\r\n  also to undress him, and to wait on him at dinner, \"having for his fee\r\n  the King's bed and all the furniture of his chamber, the night apparel\r\n  and the silver basin wherein the King washes, with the towels.\" It is\r\n  traditional that if the King sleeps at Westminster he must occupy the\r\n  Lord Great Chamberlain's house. George IV. did so on the eve of his\r\n  Coronation, the Speaker of the House of Commons handing over his\r\n  residence for the purpose to the Lord Great Chamberlain for a nominal\r\n  fee. On this occasion the officials in waiting on His Majesty spent a\r\n  restless night. Lord Gwydyr, the Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain, and\r\n  his secretary, took their stand on one side of the King's chamber, and\r\n  the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod on the other, and there they\r\n  remained until morning. (See \"The Gentleman's Magazine.\" July, 1821.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTMINSTER HALL IN 1797\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING BY C. MOSLEY]\r\n\r\nThe Great Hall still continued to be used as the most appropriate\r\nstage for State ceremonies, for coronations and the banquets with\r\nwhich such events were celebrated. It was also the scene of most of\r\nthe great State trials famous in English history. Such men as William\r\nWallace, the Earls of Arundel, of Essex, and of Strafford, were here\r\narraigned upon a charge of high treason; here Charles I. was condemned\r\nto death. In Westminster Hall Titus Oates was stripped of his\r\necclesiastical habit and exposed to public obloquy, with a placard\r\nupon his breast declaring his offence. Beneath this wide oak roof the\r\nDuchess of Kingston was tried for bigamy, much to her delight. Here,\r\ntoo, Warren Hastings faced his accusers, and triumphed over them. This\r\nis the Hall, as Macaulay says in a well-known passage, which witnessed\r\nthe just sentence of Bacon and the just absolution of Somers; the Hall\r\nwhere the eloquence of the latter for a moment awed and melted a\r\nvictorious party inflamed with just resentment. This, we may now add,\r\nis the Hall where the body of Gladstone lay in state, and the mortal\r\nremains of King Edward VII. received the homage of his sorrowing\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nNo State trial has been held in Westminster Hall since Lord Melville\r\nwas acquitted there in 1806, and on the only recent occasion on which\r\na member of the House of Lords was tried by his peers, on July 18,\r\n1901, the Royal Gallery of the Lords was fitted up as a court.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the coronation feasts, which were held in Westminster\r\nHall, provided the public with a stately and imposing spectacle. Not\r\nthe least interesting part of the ceremony consisted in the entrance\r\nof the King's Champion, clad in armour and mounted upon a fiery\r\ncharger, who flung down his gauntlet and challenged to mortal combat\r\nall who dared to question the monarch's right to the throne. The feat\r\nrequired some personal courage, as well as the possession of a docile\r\nsteed, for if it were not accomplished successfully the effect might\r\nwell be ludicrous. Before the coronation of George III., Horace\r\nWalpole relates, Lord Talbot had spent much care in training his\r\ncharger to walk backwards, so that it might make a graceful exit from\r\nthe Hall without ever exposing its tail to the royal gaze.\r\nUnfortunately, the lesson had been too well learnt, and the horse\r\ninsisted upon entering the Hall backwards, much to the amusement of\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\nSovereigns are no longer crowned in Westminster Hall, but in the Abbey\r\nclose by, and no coronation feast has been held there since the\r\naccession of George IV., when the guests repaid their sovereign's\r\nhospitality by carrying away most of his spoons as souvenirs of the\r\nevent. The Hall has, however, been the scene of other less-important\r\nbanquets, as, for instance, in 1905, when the officers of the visiting\r\nFrench fleet were entertained there as the guests of the British\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nTo Westminster Hall, Henry II. summoned his Barons in Council, and in\r\nthe reign of Henry III. parliaments were often held there. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the building became devoted exclusively to the judicial side\r\nof the king's Great Council, and, when Edward I. occupied the throne\r\nof England, the Courts of King's Bench and Chancery held their\r\nmeetings regularly at the south end of the Hall. Peter the Great,\r\nduring a brief stay in England, paid a visit to Westminster Hall, and\r\nwas much struck by the presence of a number of busy people in long\r\nblack gowns and bobtailed wigs. On being informed that these were\r\nlawyers, \"I have but two in my dominions,\" he observed thoughtfully,\r\n\"and I believe I shall hang one of those directly I get home!\"\r\n\r\nNew buildings were erected in 1738, on the west side of the Hall, to\r\naccommodate the judges, and when, about a hundred and fifty years\r\nlater, the Palace of Justice was built in the Strand, the\r\nrepresentatives of the law emigrated thither in a body.\r\n\r\nThe general public for a long time shared with the lawyers the\r\nprivilege of trading within the precincts of Westminster Hall. In\r\nEdward III.'s reign merchants' stalls abounded there, being\r\ntemporarily boarded over on the occasion of State pageants, and, at a\r\nmuch later date, Laud tells us in his diary, a conflagration in one\r\nof these shops threatened to destroy the entire building.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century, book-sellers, law-stationers, and\r\nother tradesmen still plied their callings in the Hall, undisturbed by\r\nthe pleadings of their legal rivals.[98] On the one side, as we read\r\nin a contemporary chronicle, were to be seen \"Men with Baubles and\r\nToys, and on the other taken up with the Fear of Judgment, on which\r\ndepends their inevitable Destiny. On your Left Hand you hear a nimble\r\nTongu'd _Sempstress_, with her Charming Treble, Invite you to buy some\r\nof her Knick-Knacks: And on your Right, a Deep-mouth'd Cryar\r\ncommanding Impossibilities, viz. Silence to be kept among Women and\r\nLawyers.\"[99] In the days of Pepys, the Great Hall had become a\r\nregular meeting-place for the public, and was still the most popular\r\nmarket for the sale of books.[100]\r\n\r\n  [98] Forster's \"Grand Remonstrance,\" p. 276, note.\r\n\r\n  [99] Brown's \"Amusements,\" pp. 39-40.\r\n\r\n  [100] \"At Westminster Hall, where Mrs. Lane and the rest of the maids\r\n  had their white scarfs, all having been at the burial of a young\r\n  bookseller in the Hall,\" \"Pepys' Diary,\" 20 January, 1659.\r\n\r\nTrade has long been banished from the portals of Westminster Hall, its\r\nstately precincts are now desecrated by no foot less worthy than that\r\nof the Member of Parliament or the Saturday sight-seer. In other\r\nrespects the Hall remains unchanged. Save for the retimbering of the\r\nroof in 1820 with oak taken from old men-of-war, it stands to-day much\r\nas it has stood for centuries. Structural alterations have\r\noccasionally been suggested, but without effect. One projected by Lord\r\nGrenville, necessitating the removal and raising of the entire roof,\r\nevoked many indignant protests.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101]\r\n      \"With cedar roof, and stony wall,\r\n      Old William Rufus built this hall;\r\n      Without a roof, with scarce a wall,\r\n      William Unroof-us spoils it all.\"\r\n\r\n  Hawkins's \"Biographical Sketches,\" vol. i. p. 341.\r\n\r\nIn New Palace Yard, opposite the entrance of Westminster Hall, a huge\r\nclock-tower once stood. It had been erected in the reign of Edward I.,\r\nthe cost being defrayed by a fine levied on Sir Ralph de Hengham,\r\nChief Justice of the King's Bench, as a penalty for altering a\r\njudicial record in favour of a pauper litigant. In this tower hung a\r\nbell, known as \"Great Tom of Westminster,\" whose voice on a clear day\r\ncould be beard as far away as Windsor.[102] In 1707 both tower and\r\nbell were pulled down, the latter being recast and presented to St\r\nPaul's Cathedral where it still hangs.\r\n\r\n  [102] There is a well-known story of a sentry at the Castle who was\r\n  accused of sleeping at his post, and secured his acquittal by proving\r\n  that he had heard \"Great Tom\" strike thirteen times at midnight--a\r\n  fact which was corroborated by the evidence of independent witnesses.\r\n\r\nNear the tower was a fountain from which on great occasions wine was\r\nmade to flow for the delectation of the populace, while close by stood\r\nthe pillory in which Titus Oates, John Williams, the publisher of John\r\nWilkes's _North Briton_, and many other offenders against\r\nparliamentary privilege, suffered the penalty of their crimes.\r\n\r\nWestminster Hall lies nearly due north and south. At its south-east\r\nangle, stretching towards the river, stands St. Stephen's Hall, on the\r\nsite of that famous Chapel, founded by King Stephen and called after\r\nhis sainted namesake, which was for so long the home of the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel was partly destroyed by fire in 1298, but was subsequently\r\nrestored at great cost by Edward III., who also built an adjacent\r\nbelfry of stone and timber containing three huge bells which were rung\r\nat \"coronations, triumphs, funerals of princes, and their obits.\"[103]\r\nAfter the Reformation the thirteenth century decorations which\r\noriginally adorned the walls of St. Stephen's Chapel were whitewashed\r\nand covered with boards, and the building was given over to\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n  [103] These bells must have been extremely unpopular, since it was\r\n  fabled that their ringing \"soured all the drink in the town.\" Stow's\r\n  \"Survey of London,\" p. 175.\r\n\r\nThough the Three Estates originally sat together, they seem to have\r\ndeliberated separately. Parliament used to meet occasionally in the\r\nPriory Church of Blackfriars Monastery, but when the Houses parted\r\ncompany a chamber in the Palace of Westminster was reserved for the\r\nLords, while the Commons retired to the Chapter House of the Abbey.\r\nLater on they assembled in or near Westminster Hall--Richard II. held\r\na parliament in a building erected for the purpose outside the Great\r\nHall--and finally, about the year 1550, St. Stephen's Chapel was fixed\r\nupon as the regular meeting-place of the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel was an oblong building, but half as long and half as broad\r\nas Westminster Hall, and most of the floor space was occupied by the\r\nLobby. It was a gloomy and narrow chamber, and what the German\r\ntraveller Moritz calls \"mean-looking.\" At the western end was a\r\ngallery to which members ascended by means of a ladder near the\r\nsouthern window.[104] At the eastern end stood the Speaker's chair,\r\nand opposite it the famous bar where so many persons have stood,\r\neither as prisoners, witnesses, or patriots. Here Pepys, buoyed up\r\nwith brandy, appeared to answer the charges that had been brought\r\nagainst the Navy Office in 1667-8. Here, a century and a half later,\r\nMrs. Clarke, the Duke of York's discarded mistress, was examined for\r\ntwo hours on the subject of his alleged corrupt sale of\r\ncommissions--an ordeal from which she emerged triumphantly. At this\r\nbar victorious soldiers, from the days of Schomberg to those of\r\nWellington, have received the thanks of Parliament for the services\r\nthey rendered to their country. And many a trembling prisoner has\r\nstood here to receive sentence or reprimand at the mouth of the\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n  [104] Speaker Lenthall once rebuked a youthful member who was sitting\r\n  perched upon the topmost rung, listening to a debate, and bade him\r\n  come down and not \"sit upon the ladder as though he were going to be\r\n  hanged.\" Forster's \"Historical Sketches,\" vol. i. p. 82.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the old House were ranged rows of wooden benches,\r\nhard and comfortless, with neither backs nor covering. Not even were\r\nMinisters provided with padded seats.\r\n\r\n    \"No satin covering decks th' unsightly boards;\r\n    No velvet cushion holds the youthful Lords;\r\n    And claim illustrious tails such small regard?\r\n    Ah! Tails too tender for a seat so hard!\"[105]\r\n\r\n  [105] \"The Rolliad.\"\r\n\r\nSt Stephen's Chapel was in size quite inadequate to the needs of\r\nlegislators--the only point, perhaps, in which it resembled the\r\npresent House of Commons. David Hume complained perpetually of the\r\nlack of room; while Cobbett cynically referred to it as \"the little\r\nhole into which we are all crammed to make the laws by which this\r\ngreat kingdom is governed.\"[106] Lined with dark wainscot and lit by\r\nthree chandeliers, the gloomy chamber did not impress the stranger\r\nwith the dignity or splendour of parliaments, and a visitor to St\r\nStephen's might well have been excused for mistaking the House of\r\nCommons for a den of thieves or a crew of midnight conspirators.[107]\r\n\r\n  [106] Dalling's \"Historical Characters,\" vol. ii. p. 175.\r\n\r\n  [107] Knight's \"London,\" vol. ii. p. 68.\r\n\r\nAs was only natural, the dingy surroundings exercised a detrimental\r\ninfluence upon the manners of members. Moritz was surprised to see\r\nmany of them lying stretched out at full length on the uncomfortable\r\nbenches fast asleep, while others cracked nuts or ate oranges. \"The\r\nmany rude things the members said to one another,\" he observes sadly,\r\n\"struck me much.\"[108] Not only was the House squalid and dirty, it\r\nwas also infested with rats. Speaker Manners Sutton told Thomas Moore\r\nthat the only time he had ever laughed while occupying the Chair was\r\nduring a debate in which members of the Opposition had been squabbling\r\nfiercely together, when he saw a large rat issue from beneath the\r\nfront Opposition bench and walk deliberately across to the Treasury\r\nside of the House.[109]\r\n\r\n  [108] Pinkerton's \"Voyages,\" vol. ii. p. 508.\r\n\r\n  [109] Moore's \"Memoirs,\" vol. iv. p. 320.\r\n\r\nThe Lobby of St Stephen's was, if possible, the scene of even greater\r\ndiscomfort and squalor than was the House itself. It was perpetually\r\ncrowded, not only with members and their servants, but also with the\r\ngeneral public, and was \"as noisy as a Jews' synagogue.\" Pearson, for\r\nmany years head doorkeeper of the Commons, tells us that orange women\r\ntraded there regularly, selling their wares to thirsty politicians\r\nduring the sitting of the House. One old woman named Drybutter was a\r\ngreat favourite among a certain class of members, and knew more of\r\ntheir private affairs (we are told) than \"all the old bawds in\r\nChristendom put together.\"[110] Another, Mullins by name, \"a young,\r\nplump, crummy, rosy looking wench, with clean white silk stockings,\r\nTurkey leather shoes, pink silk _short_ petticoat, to show her ancle\r\nto the young bulls and old goats of the House,\" appealed especially to\r\nthe more amorous members.\r\n\r\n    \"Mark how her winning smiles and 'witching eyes\r\n    On yonder unfledg'd orator she tries!\r\n    Mark with what grace she offers to his hand\r\n    The tempting orange, pride of China's land!\"[111]\r\n\r\n  [110] Pearson's \"Political Dictionary,\" p. 37.\r\n\r\n  [111] \"The Rolliad.\"\r\n\r\nShe was said to have killed more men with her eyes and sighs than did\r\nmany a general with his canister and grape-shot in the American war.\r\nOranges and biscuits were not, as may be imagined, this fascinating\r\ncreature's sole stock in trade.\r\n\r\nIn Stuart days the walls of St Stephen's Chapel were temporarily\r\nbrightened by the presence of the tapestry which Charles II. hung\r\nthere. This, however, was taken down in 1706. About a hundred years\r\nlater, when alterations were being made to provide accommodation for\r\nthe recently added Irish members, the old thirteenth-century mural\r\npaintings were discovered beneath the wainscot. No one, however, seems\r\nto have realised their value, and they were carelessly allowed to\r\nperish, sharing the fate that befell the curious old tapestries which\r\nonce adorned the walls of the famous Painted Chamber.\r\n\r\nThis Painted Chamber, which lay between the two Houses of Parliament,\r\nwas the original Council Chamber of the Norman kings. Here parliaments\r\nwere opened, and conferences of both Houses held. Its walls were hung\r\nwith tapestry on which were depicted various scenes from the Siege of\r\nTroy. This was removed at the commencement of the nineteenth century\r\nand thrown into a cellar, being subsequently sold in 1820 for the\r\npaltry sum of £10, and beneath it was found the series of\r\npaintings--representing the Wars of the Maccabees and scenes from the\r\nlife of Edward the Confessor--from which the Chamber derived its name.\r\nIt was in this apartment that the death warrant of Charles I. was\r\nsigned, when Oliver Cromwell and Henry Martin distinguished themselves\r\nby childishly blacking one another's faces with ink. Here Charles II.\r\nlay in state after his death, as did also Chatham and William Pitt.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Painted Chamber was the room in which the Peers formerly\r\nmet and sat, and which may therefore be styled the old House of Lords.\r\nThe Prince's Chamber, afterwards the Robing Room of the Lords, was\r\ndecorated with elaborate tapestries, of Dutch workmanship,\r\nrepresenting the destruction of the Spanish Armada, which had been\r\npresented to Queen Elizabeth by the States of Holland, and\r\nsubsequently sold by Lord Howard to James I. These tapestries were\r\nafterwards transferred to the Court of Requests, and, when the greater\r\npart of the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in October,\r\n1834, perished in the flames.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed, in 1834, to find temporary quarters for the Court of\r\nBankruptcy in the old tally-room of the exchequer. For this purpose it\r\nbecame necessary to remove several cartloads of old \"tallies\" which\r\nhad accumulated during past years and were likely to interfere with\r\nthe arrangements. These tallies were nothing but pieces of wood on\r\nwhich were recorded by a primitive method of notches the sums paid\r\ninto the exchequer. The system dated from the Conquest and, though it\r\nhad been officially abolished in 1783, was still in use as late as\r\n1826. Old tallies were usually burnt on bonfires in Tothill fields or\r\nin Palace Yard, but in 1834 some official of an economical turn of\r\nmind decided to make use of them as fuel for the stoves of the House\r\nof Lords. The workmen engaged upon the work shared with all honest\r\nBritish labourers the desire to finish their job as quickly as\r\npossible and get home to their tea. They consequently piled the\r\ntallies into the stoves with more energy than discretion, little\r\ndreaming of the possible effect upon the overheated furnaces.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of October, some visitors\r\nwho were being shown round the House of Lords observed that the floor\r\nwas very hot under their feet, and that the Chamber seemed to be half\r\nfilled with smoke. They were reassured by the officials, and no\r\nfurther notice was taken of their remarks. Two hours later the tallies\r\nhad done their work, the flues were red-hot, one of the walls was well\r\nalight, and flames were seen to be issuing from the windows of the\r\nHouse. The alarm was immediately given. Fire-engines were hastily\r\nsummoned to the scene, and police and troops assembled in force in\r\nPalace Yard.\r\n\r\nThe appliances for coping with any but the mildest of conflagrations\r\nwere then altogether inadequate, and it soon became evident that most\r\nof the Palace was doomed. Vast crowds had meanwhile gathered to\r\nwitness the destruction of the parliament building, while peers and\r\nmembers hastened to Westminster to assist in the work of salvage.\r\nHume, who had so often tried to obtain for the Commons a Chamber more\r\nsuitable to their needs, was one of the first to arrive, and did\r\nyeoman service in saving the contents of the House of Commons\r\nLibrary.[112] He was chaffingly accused of being the author of the\r\nfire, and, as the ancient home of the Commons rose in smoke to the\r\nsky, his friends declared that his motion for a new House was being\r\n\"carried without a division.\" Lord Althorp, another interested\r\nspectator, cared even less for the preservation of St. Stephen's\r\nChapel than did Hume. \"D---- the House of Commons!\" he cried, \"Save,\r\noh, save the Hall!\"[113] His wish was gratified, and Westminster\r\nHall, together with the old House of Lords and the Painted Chamber,\r\nwas among the few buildings snatched from the flames. St. Stephen's\r\nCrypt, situated underneath the old House of Commons, survived not only\r\nthe fire, but also the subsequent rebuilding.\r\n\r\n  [112] A comparatively modern institution which did not exist until the\r\n  year 1818.\r\n\r\n  [113] Miss Martineau's \"History of the Peace,\" vol. iii. p. 147.\r\n\r\nWhen the flames had at last been extinguished, or had died down from\r\nsheer lack of fuel, and the extent of the damage had been ascertained,\r\nParliament assembled once more--the Lords in what remained of their\r\nlibrary, the Commons in one of the surviving committee rooms. It was\r\nthen decided temporarily to fit up the old House of Lords for the use\r\nof the Commons, and to relegate the Peers to the Painted Chamber,\r\nuntil steps could be taken to provide the Great Council of the nation\r\nwith a more suitable home.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, British architects were invited to submit\r\ndesigns for the new Houses of Parliament, which it was proposed to\r\nerect on the site of the old Palace of Westminster, and, in 1836, the\r\ndesign of Charles Barry was selected from some ninety-seven others.\r\nWith as little delay as possible the work was put into the hands of\r\nthe successful competitor, and on April, 27, 1840, the first stone was\r\nlaid without ceremony by the architect's wife.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment until the completion of the building, poor Barry's\r\nlife was made a burden to him by the continual petty interference of\r\nthe authorities. Perpetual squabbles arose between the architect and\r\nthe superintending officials over every point of the construction--even\r\nthe contract for the manufacture of the clock gave rise to an acrimonious\r\ncontroversy--while the question of expense was a never ending source of\r\nworry and difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REMAINS OF ST. STEPHEN'S CHAPEL AFTER THE FIRE OF\r\n1834\r\n\r\nFROM A LITHOGRAPH AFTER THE DRAWING BY JOHN TAYLOR, JR.]\r\n\r\nBarry's original design had included the enclosing of New Palace Yard,\r\nand the building of a huge gate-tower at the angles. He had also\r\nproposed to make Victoria Tower the chief feature of a big quadrangle,\r\nwhence a splendid processional approach should extend to Buckingham\r\nPalace. The cost of such a scheme, however, precluded its\r\nexecution, and the architect had to content himself with the present\r\nmagnificent group of buildings, too well known to require detailed\r\ndescription, which form the best possible memorial to Sir Charles\r\nBarry's genius.[114]\r\n\r\n  [114] Barry was assisted in his work by another well-known artist,\r\n  Augustus Welby Pugin. The latter's son afterwards claimed for his\r\n  father the honour of being the real designer of the Houses of\r\n  Parliament, but his efforts to wrest the laurels from Barry's brow met\r\n  with little success.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Queen Victoria entered the new Houses of Parliament for the\r\nfirst time, and some eight years later the whole building was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe fire of 1834 proved a blessing in disguise. The ancient congeries\r\nof huddled buildings, to which additions had been made in various\r\nstyles by so many kings, and which went by the name of the Palace of\r\nWestminster, had long ceased to provide a suitable home for the Mother\r\nof Parliaments. From the ashes of the royal residence arose at length\r\na structure worthy to rank with any legislative building in the world,\r\nand adequate to the requirements of that national council which\r\ncontrols the destiny of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nTowering above both Houses stands the lofty clock-tower which is one\r\nof the landmarks of the metropolis. From its summit \"Big Ben\"--the\r\nsuccessor to \"Great Tom of Westminster\"--booms forth the hours, while\r\nstill higher burns that nightly light which shows to a sleeping city\r\nthat the faithful Commons remain vigilant and at work.[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] Big Ben was so named after Sir Benjamin Hall, First Commissioner\r\n  of Works. The light is extinguished by an official in the House of\r\n  Commons by means of an electric switch, the moment the Speaker's\r\n  question \"that the House do now adjourn\" has been agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe new Upper Chamber, with its harmonious decorations of gilt and\r\nstained glass, its crimson benches, and its atmosphere of dignity and\r\nrepose, supplies a perfect stage for the leisurely deliberations of\r\nour hereditary legislators, and forms a becoming background for such\r\npicturesque pageants as the Opening of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe present House of Commons, though too small to accommodate a full\r\nassemblage of its members, makes up in comfort for what it may lack in\r\nspace. The Chamber is illuminated by a strong light from the glass\r\nroof above; the green benches are cushioned and comfortable. At one\r\nend is the Speaker's chair, and in front of it the table--that\r\n\"substantial piece of furniture,\" as Disraeli called it, when he\r\nthanked Providence that its bulk was interposed between Mr. Gladstone\r\nand himself--upon which Sir Robert Peel used to strike resonant blows\r\nat regular two-minute intervals during his speeches. On this table\r\nlies the heavy despatch-box which countless Premiers have thumped, and\r\nwhich still bears the impress of Gladstone's signet ring. Here, too,\r\nreposes the mace, that ancient symbol of the royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe mace is, perhaps, the most important article of furniture--if it\r\ncan be so described--in the House. Its absence or loss is an even more\r\nappalling catastrophe than would be the absence of the Speaker. It is\r\npossible to provide a substitute for the latter, but there is no\r\ndeputy-mace, and without it the House cannot be held to be properly\r\nconstituted. The present mace is engraved with the initials \"C. R.\"\r\nand the royal arms, and is the one that was made at the Restoration,\r\nto replace Cromwell's \"bauble,\" which disappeared with the Crown plate\r\nin 1649. It is kept at the Tower of London when the House is not\r\nsitting, and the fact that its absence prevents the conduct of any\r\nbusiness has been, on one occasion at least, the cause of grave\r\ninconvenience. In the middle of the last century Parliament adjourned\r\nfor the day in order to attend a great naval review at Spithead, and\r\nwas timed to meet again at 10 p.m. The special return-train containing\r\nmembers of the House of Commons was run in two portions, and the\r\nofficial who held the key of the mace-cupboard happened to be\r\ntravelling in the second. As this was an hour late in arriving, the\r\nHouse had to postpone its meeting until eleven at night.[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] Mowbray's \"Seventy Years at Westminster,\" p. 90.\r\n\r\nUpon the position of the mace a great deal depends. When the mace\r\nlies _upon_ the table, says Hatsell, the House is a House; \"when\r\n_under_, it is a Committee. When _out_ of the House, no business can\r\nbe done; when _from_ the table and upon the Sergeant's shoulder, the\r\nSpeaker alone manages.\" On the famous occasion in 1626, when Sir John\r\nEliot offered a remonstrance against \"tonnage and poundage,\" when\r\nSpeaker Finch refused to put the question, and the House almost came\r\nto blows, Sergeant-at-Arms Edward Grimston tried to close the sitting\r\nby removing the mace. At once a fiery member, Sir Miles Hobart, seized\r\nit from him, replaced it on the table, locked the door of the House,\r\nand put the key in his pocket, thus excluding Black Rod, who was on\r\nhis way to the Commons with a message from the king.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant-at-Arms is custodian of the mace. Attired in his\r\ntight-fitting black coat, knee-breeches, and buckled shoes, with his\r\nsword at his side, he carries it ceremoniously upon his shoulder\r\nwhenever he accompanies the Speaker in or out of the Chamber. He is\r\nalso, as we shall see, responsible for the maintenance of order within\r\nthe precincts of the House, and is provided with a chair near the Bar,\r\nwhence he can obtain a good view of the whole Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements made for the convenience and personal comfort of a\r\nmodern legislator are of the most elaborate and thoughtful kind.\r\nMembers of the Government, Whips, and the Leader of the Opposition are\r\nprovided with private rooms in which to do their work. The needs of\r\nhumbler politicians are no less carefully considered. By means of an\r\nintricate system of ventilation the atmosphere of both Houses is\r\nmaintained at an equable temperature, summer and winter. The very air\r\ninhaled by our politicians is so cleansed and rarefied by a system of\r\nwater-sprays, of cotton-wool screens and ice-chambers, that it reaches\r\ntheir lungs in a filtered condition, free from all those impurities of\r\ndust and fog which are part of the less-favoured Londoner's daily\r\npabulum.\r\n\r\nThe statesman who seeks a momentary relaxation from the arduous duties\r\nof the Chamber can find repose in comfortable smoking-rooms where\r\neasy-chairs abound. He may stroll upon the Terrace in the cool of the\r\nevening, enjoying the society of such lady friends as he may have\r\ninvited to tea, and watching the stately procession of barges and\r\nsteamers that flows by him. (Occasionally the barges are loaded with\r\nunsavoury refuse, of which his scandalized nostrils are made\r\nunpleasantly aware. Sometimes, too, some wag in a passing\r\nexcursion-boat facetiously bids him return to his work in the House.)\r\nHeated by an unusually warm debate, or tired out by a lengthy sitting,\r\nhe may retire to spend a pleasant half-hour in luxurious bathrooms,\r\nwhence division bells summon him in vain. His intellectual wants are\r\nministered to in well-furnished libraries, whose courteous custodians\r\nare ever ready to impart information, to look up parliamentary\r\nprecedents, and otherwise to add to his store of knowledge. His inner\r\nman is generously catered for by a Kitchen Committee, composed of the\r\ngourmets of the House, who choose his wine and cigars, and watch over\r\nthe cooking of his food with a vigilant and fastidious eye. His meals\r\nare appetising and at the same time inexpensive, and, as he sits in\r\nthe spacious dining-rooms set apart for his use, his mind may travel\r\nback with kindly scorn to the days when his political ancestors drank\r\ntheir cups of soup at Alice's coffee-house, munched the homely fare\r\nsupplied in Bellamy's kitchen, or satisfied their hunger in even\r\nsimpler fashion on the benches of the House itself. Lord Morpeth, who\r\nwas a Minister of the Crown in 1840, used always to suck oranges on\r\nthe Treasury bench during the course of his own speeches. Fox ate\r\ninnumerable dry biscuits on the hottest nights. David Hume, whose\r\ndevotion to duty prevented him from leaving his seat in the Chamber,\r\nwas in the habit of providing himself with a generous supply of pears,\r\nwhich he consumed while his less conscientious colleagues were slaking\r\ntheir thirst in Bellamy's finest port.[117] During a twenty-one hours'\r\nsitting in August, 1880, a member (Mr. A. M. Sullivan) brought a\r\nlarge bag of buns into the House, and enjoyed what Mr. Labouchère\r\ncalled \"a palpable supper.\"[118] The sight of a member of Parliament\r\nenjoying an _al fresco_ meal under the eye of the Speaker would to-day\r\narouse indignant shouts of \"Order!\" Even the simple sandwich is taboo\r\nin the Chamber of either House, and nothing more solid or more potent\r\nthan a glass of pure well-water, or perhaps an egg-flip, can be\r\npartaken of during debate.\r\n\r\n  [117] Francis' \"Orators of the Age,\" p. 212, and Grant's \"Random\r\n  collections,\" p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [118] T. P. O'Connor's \"Gladstone's House of Commons,\" p. 88.\r\n\r\nCould Pitt return to the scene of his former triumphs, he would indeed\r\nmarvel at the splendours of the modern parliamentary restaurant--Pitt,\r\nwhose thoughts even upon his deathbed are said to have reverted\r\nlovingly to the delights of the old House of Commons kitchen. \"I think\r\nI could eat one of Bellamy's pork pies\" were the great statesman's\r\nlast words as he expired at Putney in January, 1806, and it was no\r\ndoubt at Bellamy's humble board that he drank many a bottle of that\r\nwine for which he entertained so strong a predilection.\r\n\r\nPearson, the famous doorkeeper of the House of Commons, has described\r\nBellamy's as \"a damn'd good house, upstairs, where I have drank many a\r\npipe of red port. Here the members, who cannot say more than 'Yes' or\r\n'No' below, can speechify for hours to Mother Bellamy about\r\nbeef-steaks and pork-chops. Sir Watkin Lewes always dresses them there\r\nhimself; and I'll be curst if he ben't a choice hand at a beef-steak\r\nand a bottle, as well as a pot and a pipe.\"[119]\r\n\r\n  [119] Pearson's \"Political Dictionary,\" p. 19.\r\n\r\nDickens, in his \"Sketches by Boz,\" has left a picture of that\r\nold-fashioned eating-room, with the large open fire, the\r\nroasting-jack, the gridiron, the deal tables and wax candles, the\r\ndamask linen cloths, and the bare floor, where peers and members of\r\nParliament assembled with their friends[120] to sit over their modest\r\nmeals until it was time for a division, or, as Sheil says, \"the\r\nwhipper-in aroused them to the only purpose for which their existence\r\nwas recognized.\"\r\n\r\n  [120] \"25 April, 1822. Eat cold meat at Bellamy's (introduced by\r\n  Lambton); and did not leave the House till near two.\"--Thomas Moore's\r\n  \"Memoirs,\" vol. iii. p. 346.\r\n\r\nOld Bellamy, a wine-merchant by profession, was in 1773 appointed\r\nDeputy-Housekeeper to the House of Commons, and provided with a\r\nkitchen, a dining-room, and a small subsidy to cover his expenses as\r\nparliamentary caterer. After nearly forty years' service in this\r\ncapacity he was succeeded by his son John, who continued to control\r\nthe culinary department until well into the last century. Refreshments\r\nof a serious kind were not really required by politicians until the\r\ndays when Parliament took to sitting late at night. In 1848, however,\r\nBellamy's system of supplying members with food was not considered\r\nsufficiently adequate, and a select committee was appointed to inquire\r\ninto it. As soon as Parliament reassembled in the new Palace of\r\nWestminster, after the fire, the catering of the House of Commons was\r\ntaken over by a Kitchen Committee, while that of the Lords was placed\r\nin the hands of a contractor.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Bellamys the charges for solid refreshments were\r\nnot really high--the caterer relied very largely for his profits upon\r\nthe sale of wine--but in comparison with the tariff of to-day they\r\nmust appear exorbitant. For half-a-crown Bellamy provided his patrons\r\nwith a meal consisting of cold meat, bread and cheese; double that sum\r\nsecured a liberal dinner, which included tart and a salad. Claret cost\r\n10s. a bottle, while a similar quantity of port and madeira was to be\r\nhad for 6_s._ or 8_s._ To-day a member of Parliament can be supplied\r\nwith a dinner of several courses for the modest sum of 1_s._, and\r\nevery item on the daily bill of fare is proportionately inexpensive.\r\n\r\nBellamy's was not only the eating-place of Parliament; it also partook\r\nof some of the qualities of the modern smoking-room as a refuge from\r\ndebate. The sudden concourse of members who came hurrying into the\r\nkitchen as soon as a bore rose to his feet in the House has been\r\namusingly described by Sheil in his essay on John Leslie Foster. Poor\r\nMr. Foster seems to have exercised an extraordinarily clearing effect\r\nupon the House. The first words of his speech were the signal for a\r\nunanimous excursion of his fellows, and he was left in full possession\r\nof that solitude which he ever had the unrivalled power of creating.\r\nMembers hastened to the kitchen where the tiresome voice of the\r\nparliamentary bore could not penetrate, and there indulged themselves\r\nin conversation, eked out with tea or stronger beverages. \"The scene\r\nwhich Bellamy's presents to a stranger is striking enough,\" says\r\nSheil. \"Two smart girls, whose briskness and neat attire made up for\r\ntheir want of beauty, and for the invasions of time, of which their\r\ncheeks showed the traces, helped out tea in a room in the corridor. It\r\nwas pleasant to observe the sons of dukes and marquises, and the\r\npossessors of twenties and thirties of thousands a year, gathered\r\nround these damsels, and soliciting a cup of that beverage which it\r\nwas their office to administer. These Bellamy barmaids seemed so\r\nfamiliarized with their occupation that they went through it with\r\nperfect nonchalance, and would occasionally turn with petulance, in\r\nwhich they asserted the superiority of their sex to rank and opulence,\r\nfrom the noble or wealthy suitors for a draught of tea, by whom they\r\nwere surrounded.\" The unfortunate Irish members, we are told, were\r\nregarded with a peculiar disdain, being continually reminded of their\r\nprovinciality by the scornful looks of these parliamentary Hebes, who\r\ntreated them \"as mere colonial deputies should be received in the\r\npurlieus of the State.\" Dickens, too, describes how one of the\r\nwaitresses, Jane by name, who was something of a character, would\r\nplayfully dig the handle of a fork into the arm of some too amorous\r\nmember who sought to detain her.[121] \"I passed from these\r\nante-chambers to the tavern,\" continues Sheil, \"where I found a number\r\nof members assembled at dinner. Half an hour had passed away,\r\ntooth-picks and claret were now beginning to appear, and the business\r\nof mastication being concluded, that of digestion had commenced, and\r\nmany an honourable gentleman, I observed, seemed to prove that he was\r\nborn only to digest. At the end of a long corridor which opened from\r\nthe room where the diners were assembled, there stood a waiter, whose\r\noffice it was to inform any interrogator what gentleman was speaking\r\nbelow stairs. Nearly opposite the door sat two English county members.\r\nThey had disposed of a bottle each, and just as the last glass was\r\nemptied, one of them called out to the annunciator at the end of the\r\npassage for intelligence. 'Mr. Foster on his legs,' was the formidable\r\nanswer. 'Waiter, bring another bottle!' was the immediate effect of\r\nthis information, which was followed by a similar injunction from\r\nevery table in the room. I perceived that Mr. Bellamy owed great\r\nobligations to Mr. Foster. But the latter did not limit himself to a\r\nsecond bottle; again and again the same question was asked, and again\r\nthe same announcement was returned--'Mr. Foster upon his legs!' The\r\nanswer seemed to fasten men in inseparable adhesiveness to their\r\nseats. Thus hours went by, when, at length, 'Mr. Plunket on his legs!'\r\nwas heard from the end of the passage, and the whole convocation of\r\ncompotators rose together and returned to the House.\"[122]\r\n\r\n  [121] \"Sketches by Boz,\" p. 109 (1855).\r\n\r\n  [122] Sheil's \"Sketches of the Irish Bar,\" vol. ii. p. 236.\r\n\r\nAlas! Bellamy's roaring fire is long extinguished, his candles have\r\nburnt down to their sockets, and been replaced by electric light. The\r\ncomfortable days of lengthy dinners are past and gone, and the modern\r\nmember has barely time to snatch a hasty meal in the Commons'\r\ndining-room ere he returns to the bustle and confusion of the House.\r\nThings have indeed changed since the leisurely days when Bellamy could\r\nadequately cater for the needs of Parliament. His small staff and\r\nhumble kitchen would have but little chance of satisfying modern\r\nrequirements in an age when over a hundred thousand meals are served\r\nto members and their friends in the course of a single session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament is not an administrative body. Summoned by the Crown, with\r\nits assent it passes laws, gives and takes away rights, authorises and\r\ndirects taxation and expenditure; but in executive business the Crown\r\nacts through Ministers who are not appointed by Parliament, though\r\nundoubtedly responsible to it for their conduct.\r\n\r\nAlfred the Great called together Councils, which in some ways\r\nresembled our present Cabinets or the Privy Council, to consider such\r\nmeasures as were afterwards submitted to the Witenagemot. In William\r\nthe Conqueror's time the _Curia Regis_ was the Great Council which he\r\nconsulted on questions of State policy. Later on, in Henry I.'s reign,\r\nthe King formed a smaller consultative body from the royal household,\r\nwhose duty it was to deal with administrative details, legislation\r\nbeing left in the hands of the National Council.\r\n\r\nIn Tudor days the Sovereign had almost dispensed with Parliament\r\naltogether--in the course of Queen Elizabeth's lengthy reign it was\r\nonly summoned thirteen times--and the country was governed\r\nautocratically by the monarch, with the aid of his Privy Council. This\r\nadvisory body varied in size from year to year. In Henry VIII.'s reign\r\nit consisted of about a dozen members; later on, the number was much\r\nincreased. In time the Privy Council became too large and cumbersome\r\nan assembly to act together without friction, and was gradually\r\nsubdivided into various committees, to each of which was given some\r\nspecific legislative function.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward VI. one of these smaller bodies was known as\r\nthe Committee of State, and from this has slowly developed the Cabinet\r\nto which we are accustomed to-day. When the Great Council of Peers was\r\nconvened at York in 1640, the Committee of State was reproachfully\r\nreferred to as the \"Cabinet Council,\"--from the fact that its meetings\r\nwere held in a small room in the Royal Palace,--and afterwards as the\r\n\"Juncto.\" It consisted of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of\r\nStrafford, and a few other leading men, and met at odd times to\r\ndiscuss important intelligence, the Privy Council only meeting when\r\nspecially summoned.\r\n\r\nJames I. acquired the habit of entrusting his confidence to a few\r\nadvisers, and his successors followed suit. The inner council, or\r\ncabal, thus originated, was the cause of much parliamentary jealousy\r\nand popular suspicion. After the fall of Clarendon in 1677, and of\r\nDanby twelve years later, Charles II. promised, in accordance with the\r\ngeneral desire, to be governed by the Privy Council, and to have no\r\nsecrets from that body. It soon became evident, however, that the King\r\nhad no intention of keeping his promise, and the Remonstrance of 1682\r\ncomplained that great affairs of State were still managed \"in Cabinet\r\nCouncils, by men unknown, and not publicly trusted.\"\r\n\r\nIn Stuart days the Commons had grown in strength from year to year,\r\nand the Privy Council had weakened proportionately, though it had\r\nincreased in size. Besides being so unwieldy as to be impracticable\r\nfor administrative purposes, it was largely composed of men who were\r\nnot in any way fitted for the post of responsible advisers. Naunton,\r\nwriting of Elizabeth's day, observed that \"there were of the Queen's\r\nCouncell that were not in the Catalogue of Saints.\"[123] And much the\r\nsame criticism would apply to the Privy Councillors of Stuart times.\r\nThe inner Cabinet, therefore, gradually assumed all the more important\r\nfunctions of the Legislature, and eventually became the ruling power\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\n  [123] \"Fragmenta Regalia,\" p. 23.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles II. the Ministry was not a united body, but was\r\ncomposed of men of different political opinions, each of whom held his\r\noffice at the King's pleasure. The Cabinet long remained, therefore,\r\nin a disorganised and subordinate condition, largely dependent upon\r\nthe royal will. Under the Tudors and Stuarts, Ministers were the\r\nmasters or servants of the Crown, according as the Sovereign was a\r\nweak or a strong one. They did not necessarily sit in Parliament, nor\r\ndid they act together in response to the views of a parliamentary\r\nmajority. The Cabinet itself consisted of an inner group of\r\nresponsible advisers and an outer circle of members with whom they\r\noften differed fundamentally. There was no need for unanimity of\r\npolitical thought in the Cabinet of those days, so long as its members\r\nwere unanimous in their subservience to the King.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1688, however, the powers of the Crown were\r\nlimited and those of Parliament extended. Ministers now customarily\r\nsat in Parliament, and gradually acquired unanimity of thought and\r\npurpose, working together with common responsibility and for common\r\ninterests.[124] The Cabinet thus became what Walter Bagehot calls a\r\n\"combining committee--a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens,\r\nthe legislative to the executive part of the State\"--and remained an\r\nessentially deliberative assembly, as opposed to the Privy Council, or\r\nadministrative body.\r\n\r\nWilliam III. had begun by convening mixed Cabinets of Whigs and\r\nTories, but in 1693 he determined to appoint Ministers all of one\r\nparty, and in two years his Cabinet was entirely composed of Whigs.\r\nThis example was followed by his successor, though unwillingly, and\r\nthe Cabinet system, as we understand it to-day, may be said to date\r\nfrom the moment when Godolphin forced Queen Anne to accept Sunderland,\r\nand, later, to remove Harley, in accordance with the views expressed\r\nby the country at elections.\r\n\r\n  [124] It is not absolutely necessary for a Cabinet Minister to sit in\r\n  either House. Gladstone was a Secretary of State from December 1845,\r\n  to July, 1846, without a seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\nBy this time Parliament had learnt to tolerate the idea of a Cabinet,\r\nand the word itself appears for the first time officially in the\r\nLords' Address to the Queen in 1711. In that year a lengthy debate\r\ntook place on the meaning of the words \"Cabinet Council,\" several\r\npeers preferring the term \"Ministers.\" Among the latter was the Earl\r\nof Peterborough, who declared that sometimes there was no Minister at\r\nall in the Cabinet Council. He seems to have regarded the members of\r\nthe Privy Council and of the Cabinet with equal contempt. The Privy\r\nCouncillors, he said, \"were such as were thought to know everything\r\nand knew nothing, and the Cabinet Councillors those who thought that\r\nnobody knew anything but themselves.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Walpole was Prime Minister, the country was governed by three\r\nbodies--the Great Council, somewhat similar to the modern Privy\r\nCouncil; the Committee of Council, a smaller assembly which met at the\r\nCockpit in Whitehall, and seems to have concerned itself chiefly with\r\nforeign affairs; and the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ROBERT WALPOLE\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAINTING BY FRANCIS HAYMAN, R.A., IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT\r\nGALLERY]\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet varied in number from eight to fourteen,\r\nand included the Great Officers of the Royal Household. In April,\r\n1740, for instance, it consisted of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the\r\nLord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy\r\nSeal, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain, the Master of the Horse,\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, two Secretaries of State, the Groom of\r\nthe Stole, the First Minister for Scotland, the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, the First Commissioner of the Admiralty, and the Master of\r\nthe Ordnance. Besides these, the Duke of Bolton was also included, for\r\nthe somewhat inadequate reason that \"he had been of it seven years\r\nago.\"[125] As such an immense body must have been quite unmanageable\r\nfrom a business point of view, there also existed an interior council,\r\nconsisting of Walpole, the Lord Chancellor, and the two Secretaries of\r\nState, who consulted together, in the first instance, on the more\r\nconfidential points, and reported the result of their deliberations\r\nto the rest of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n  [125] Hervey's \"Memoirs of George II.,\" vol. ii. p. 551.\r\n\r\nThe size and composition of a Cabinet is a question which has always\r\nbeen left entirely to the discretion of the Prime Minister. In 1770\r\nand 1783, when Lord North and Pitt were Premiers, the number was\r\nreduced to seven. Later on, this was increased; but Lord Wellesley, in\r\n1812, expressed his conviction that thirteen was an inconveniently\r\nlarge number, and Sir Robert Peel, some twenty years later, declared\r\nthat the Executive Government would be infinitely better conducted by\r\na Cabinet composed of only nine members.\r\n\r\nAmong His Majesty's advisers in Georgian days, and earlier, peers\r\nusually preponderated. The younger Pitt was the only Commoner in his\r\nfirst Cabinet. Nowadays both Houses are suitably represented.\r\n\r\nThere is no definite rule laid down as to which posts in the\r\nAdministration carry with them a seat in the Cabinet; but the First\r\nLord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy\r\nSeal, and the Lord Chancellor are invariably included. Statesmen who\r\nhold no office at all, as we have seen in the case of the Duke of\r\nBolton, have occasionally been given a seat. Hyde, afterwards Lord\r\nClarendon, sat in Charles I.'s Cabinet without office; and, later on,\r\nLord Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord John Russell were\r\neach accorded a similar privilege. Lord Mansfield, on his elevation to\r\nthe seat of the Lord Chief Justice, in 1756, became a member of the\r\nCabinet, and did not cease to take part in the discussions until 1765.\r\nThe precedent he thus created was afterwards cited in the case of Lord\r\nEllenborough, another Lord Chief Justice, who was admitted to the\r\nCabinet of \"All the Talents\" in 1806. By this time, however, the\r\ninclusion of any but the actual holders of parliamentary offices was\r\nconsidered unusual, and it has never been repeated.\r\n\r\nCabinet meetings in Charles II.'s time were first of all held twice a\r\nweek, and then on Sunday evenings. It was long customary for the\r\nSovereign to be present, and Queen Anne presided regularly over these\r\nSunday gatherings. Indeed, the absence of the King from Cabinet\r\nmeetings did not occur until the time of George I., and only arose\r\nfrom that monarch's inability to speak English. Since his day,\r\nhowever, no Sovereign has thought it necessary, or even politic, to\r\nattend.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular official meetings of the Cabinet, informal\r\ngatherings of Ministers were occasionally convened. Walpole used often\r\nto invite a few colleagues to dinner to discuss the affairs of the\r\nnation, and in the Aberdeen Government a Cabinet dinner was held\r\nweekly.[126] After the tablecloth had been removed, and the port began\r\nto circulate, measures of State were agitated and discussed, and\r\nquestions of policy decided upon. Whether Ministers were always in a\r\ncondition fit for the consideration of such grave topics is a matter\r\nof doubt. Lord Chancellor Thurlow sometimes refused to take part in\r\nthese post-prandial discussions. \"He has even more than once left his\r\ncolleagues to deliberate,\" says Wraxall, \"whilst he sullenly stretched\r\nhimself along the chair, and fell, or appeared to fall, fast\r\nasleep.\"[127]\r\n\r\n  [126] \"Our immemorial Cabinet Dinner was at Lord Lonsdale's,\" writes\r\n  Lord Malmesbury, on March 17, 1852. \"Each of us gives one on a\r\n  Wednesday.\"--\"Memoirs of an Ex-Minister,\" vol. i. p. 321.\r\n\r\n  [127] Wraxall's \"Memoirs,\" vol. i. p. 527.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet no longer meets on Sundays, and the practice of holding\r\nweekly dinners has been given up. It has no regular times of\r\nassembling, but can be summoned at any moment when the Prime Minister\r\nwishes to consult his colleagues. It is not necessary for all the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet to be present, as no quorum is needed to\r\nvalidate the proceedings, nor is there any rule laid down as to the\r\nlength of a Cabinet meeting, which may last from a brief half-hour to\r\nas much as half a day.[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] \"Granville dined at the Lord Chancellor's yesterday,\" wrote Lady\r\n  Granville to the Duke of Devonshire, on November 8, 1830, when the\r\n  question of the postponement of the King's visit to the city was\r\n  filling the minds of Ministers. \"The Chancellor came in after they\r\n  were all seated from a Cabinet that had lasted five hours, returned to\r\n  be at it again till two, and the result you see in the papers.\"--Lady\r\n  Granville's \"Letters,\" vol. ii. p. 63.\r\n\r\nThe chief point with regard to Cabinet meetings is their absolute\r\nsecrecy. No minutes are kept, no secretary or clerk is present, and\r\nonly in exceptional circumstances is some private record made of any\r\nmatter that may have been discussed. The meetings are usually held at\r\nNo. 10, Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister,\r\nor occasionally at the Foreign Office, a practice instituted by Lord\r\nSalisbury when he was Foreign Secretary, his Cabinet being so large\r\nthat the room in Downing Street could barely contain it.\r\n\r\nIn George II.'s time, No. 10, Downing Street--called after Sir George\r\nDowning, a statesman of Charles II.'s day, whom Pepys styles \"a\r\nniggardly fellow\"--belonged to the Crown, and was the town residence\r\nof Bothmar, the Hanoverian Minister. On the latter's death, King\r\nGeorge offered the house to Walpole as a gift. The Prime Minister\r\ndeclined it, however, and suggested that it should henceforward\r\naccompany the offices of the First Lord of the Treasury and the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. Externally the Prime Minister's house is\r\nnot a very imposing structure, but the traditions attached to it as\r\nthe official residence of so many eminent Englishmen enchance its\r\nvalue in the eyes of its occupants and of the public.\r\n\r\nHere, then, the Cabinet assembles to discuss the problems of Empire,\r\nwhose solution at times of stress the country awaits with such\r\nbreathless interest. Here the Prime Minister presides over that\r\nassembly which, however internally discordant, must ever present an\r\nharmonious and united front to the public. The decisions arrived at by\r\n\"His Majesty's Servants\"--no longer known as the \"Lords of the Cabinet\r\nCouncil,\" as in olden times--must always be presumably unanimous. Each\r\nMinister is held responsible for the opinions of the Cabinet as a\r\nwhole. His only escape from such responsibility lies in resignation,\r\nin either sense of that word. The defending and supporting in public\r\nof what they are really opposed to in private, is the common practice\r\nof Ministers. It is thought that one man's scruples should yield to\r\nthe judgment of the many, and \"minorities must suffer\" that\r\nGovernments may be carried on and Ministries remain undivided.[129]\r\nThere is a well-known story of Lord Melbourne's Ministry which\r\nillustrates this point. The Government had proposed to put an\r\neight-shilling duty on corn. Melbourne, who was strongly opposed to\r\nthe tax, found himself out-voted and overruled by the other members of\r\nthe Cabinet. At the end of the meeting he put his back against the\r\ndoor. \"Now, is it to lower the price of corn, or isn't it?\" he asked.\r\n\"It doesn't much matter what we say, but mind, we must all say the\r\nsame!\" In 1860, again, Lord Palmerston as Prime Minister was in favour\r\nof the House of Lords throwing out the Paper Duties Bill, which was\r\nthe measure of his own Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n  [129] See Speaker Onslow's \"Essay on Opposition,\" \"Hist. MSS.\r\n  Commission\" (1895), App. ix. p. 460.\r\n\r\nIt is not perhaps easy to imagine a modern Premier being placed in a\r\nsituation similar to that of either Lord Melbourne or Lord Palmerston.\r\nHe must necessarily, to a certain extent, have the whip hand of the\r\nCabinet. For if several of his colleagues disagree with him on a\r\nquestion of principle, and resign, he can generally appoint others;\r\nwhereas, if he resigns, the whole Ministry crumbles and falls to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister nowadays has indeed acquired a position which is\r\nalmost that of a dictator. In many ways his power is absolute and his\r\nwill autocratic. More especially is this true as regards his dealings\r\nwith the Crown. In olden days he was the servant and creature of the\r\nsovereign. He had no voice in the selection of his colleagues; he\r\nacted merely as His Majesty's chief adviser, and, as such, was liable\r\nto instant dismissal. When Pelham resigned in 1746, because he could\r\nno longer agree with the King, he was acting in a fashion that was\r\nthen unprecedented. Before that time, a Prime Minister whose views did\r\nnot coincide with those of his sovereign, was summarily dismissed.\r\nMany kings had, indeed, been in the habit of themselves undertaking\r\nthe duties of Prime Minister--Charles II. delighted in referring to\r\nhimself as his own _Premier Ministre_, though he was far too indolent\r\nto perform the work of that official--and merely looked upon their\r\nchief adviser as a convenient channel of communication between\r\nthemselves and Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that a Premier of the modern\r\ntype came into existence. With the development of the party system,\r\nthe gradual growth of the Cabinet's prestige, and the consequent\r\nweakening of the sovereign's prerogatives, the Prime Minister ceased\r\nto be the choice of the Crown, and became the nominee of the nation.\r\nAs the leader of the party in office, he acquired the unquestioned\r\nright of selecting his own Ministers. To-day, though the King still\r\nnominally chooses his Prime Minister, little individual freedom is\r\nleft to the sovereign, who is guided in his choice by the advice of\r\nthe outgoing Premier and his interpretation of the wishes of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor a very long time the very name of Prime Minister stank in the\r\nnostrils of the public and of Parliament. The word \"Premier\" was used\r\nin 1746,[130] but as late as 1761 we find George Grenville in a debate\r\nin the Commons declaring \"Prime Minister\" to be an odious title. The\r\nholder of it long occupied an anomalous position. Legally and\r\nconstitutionally he had no superiority over any other Privy\r\nCouncillor. Eight members of the Cabinet took precedence of him, by\r\nvirtue of office--a fact which naturally resulted in situations\r\npuzzling to the lay mind--the exact rank of the Prime Minister being\r\napparently impossible to define. When Lord Palmerston visited Scotland\r\nin 1863, the commander of the naval guardship was very anxious to\r\nreceive that distinguished statesman with all the ceremony befitting\r\nhis exalted position. On the subject of salutes due to a Prime\r\nMinister the naval code-book unfortunately maintained an impenetrable\r\nsilence, and gave the officer no information as to how he should act.\r\nHe eventually solved the difficulty in a thoroughly tactful manner by\r\ngiving Palmerston the salute of nineteen guns which were due to him\r\nas Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports.[131] Mr. Gladstone, who was ever\r\nmost punctilious in matters of etiquette, always resolutely declined\r\nto leave a room in front of any person of higher social rank, and many\r\na youthful peer vainly endeavoured to induce the aged Prime Minister\r\nto precede him.\r\n\r\n  [130] Coxe's \"Pelham Administration,\" vol. i. p. 486.\r\n\r\n  [131] Ashley's \"Life of Palmerston,\" vol. ii. p. 233.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister continued to occupy an ambiguous position until\r\nquite recently. It was not, indeed, until the close of Mr. Balfour's\r\nPremiership that his proper precedence was recognised. Matters were\r\nsimplified, however, when he held some ministerial office, as First\r\nLord of the Treasury, Lord President of the Council, or Foreign\r\nSecretary, whereby he became entitled to an adequate salary and an\r\nassured, if inadequate, precedence.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Walpole, who held the Premiership for twenty-one\r\nyears--though not consecutively[132]--was the first Prime Minister in\r\nthe modern sense of the word, the first to sit in the Commons, and the\r\nfirst to resign because of an adverse vote of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  [132] Walpole was First Lord of the Treasury for more than twenty-one\r\n  years, but Macaulay says that he cannot be called Prime Minister until\r\n  some time after he had been First Lord.--\"Miscellaneous Writings,\" p.\r\n  359.\r\n\r\nWalpole was in many ways a model Premier. Though not, indeed, as\r\nincorruptible as Harley, he yet possessed many of the qualities which\r\ncontributed to that statesman's success.[133] It was not genius, it\r\nwas not eloquence, it was not statesmanship that gave Harley his\r\nastounding power in Parliament, as Forster has remarked; it was\r\n\"House of Commons tact.\" Sir Robert Peel, Lord John Russell, and\r\nDisraeli each understood that art of \"managing Parliament,\" which is\r\nprobably of far greater value to a Prime Minister than either virtue\r\nor eloquence. Lord Rockingham, George Grenville, and Lord Bute--the\r\nlast uttering his words with hesitation and at long intervals, causing\r\nCharles Townshend to liken them to \"minute-guns\"--each lacked that\r\npower of oratory for which another Premier, Lord Derby, the \"Rupert of\r\ndebate,\" was more famous than for any intellectual ability.[134] Lord\r\nCastlereagh had a great influence with his party, and was a most\r\nsuccessful leader of the House of Commons. Yet he was a shocking\r\nspeaker, tiresome, involved, and obscure.[135] On one occasion he\r\nharangued the House for an hour, during no single moment of which\r\ncould any of his hearers make out what on earth he was driving at \"So\r\nmuch, Mr. Speaker, for the law of nations!\" he finally exclaimed, as\r\nhe prepared to turn to other matters.\r\n\r\n  [133] Walpole distributed government patronage freely among the\r\n  members of his own family. His relations held offices worth nearly\r\n  £15,000 a year, and, two years after he relinquished office, his own\r\n  places brought him in an annual income of £2000. He made his eldest\r\n  son Auditor of the Exchequer, and his second son Clerk of the Pells.\r\n  He gave his son Horace two posts, as Clerk of the Estreats and\r\n  Comptroller of the Pipe, when the boy was still an infant. Later on he\r\n  gave him a position in the Customs, and lastly made him Usher of the\r\n  Exchequer, an office worth about £1000 a year. See \"Memoirs of Sir\r\n  Robert Walpole,\" vol. i. p. 730; Cunningham's \"Letters of Horace\r\n  Walpole,\" vol. i. pp. lxxxiv. and 314.\r\n\r\n  [134] \"My father would be a very able man--if he knew anything,\" Lord\r\n  Stanley is supposed to have said of him. Hutton's \"Studies,\" p. 48.\r\n\r\n  [135] \"He evidently attempts to imitate Mr. Pitt in his manner and\r\n  rhetorick; but the clumsy attempts of a heavy domestic fowl to take\r\n  wing are very different from the vivid and lofty soaring of the lark.\"\r\n  Courtney's \"Characteristics,\" p. 42.\r\n\r\nParliament will, indeed, put up with a great deal from a Minister\r\nwhose honesty is unquestioned, and who has sufficient common-sense not\r\nto blunder at a moment of crisis. Nowadays, however, no man who was\r\nutterly lacking in ordinary power of speaking would be given a place\r\non the front bench. A talent for debate may not necessarily be a gauge\r\nof a man's capacity as a Minister, but only in debate can he show his\r\npowers. His success in Parliament is a test of intellect, for there,\r\nat any rate, he cannot conceal departmental ignorance. But it requires\r\njudgment, ability, and tact to become a leader. Charm and personal\r\nmagnetism are the qualities that endear a man to his followers. A\r\nkindly word, a smile, or a glance of recognition will often win the\r\naffection of a supporter more surely than the most eloquent speech,\r\nand it was in this respect that Lord John Russell, Gladstone, and Lord\r\nSalisbury, either from shortness of sight or absence of mind, failed.\r\nThe same qualities which young Grattan considered necessary for a\r\nsuccessful leader of Opposition may also prove invaluable to a Prime\r\nMinister. \"He must be affable in manner, generous in disposition, have\r\na ready hand, an open house, and a full purse. He must have a good\r\ncook for the English members, fine words and fair promises for the\r\nIrish, and sober calculations for the Scotch.\"[136] He must, indeed,\r\nbe a man who breeds confidence and inspires affection among his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\n  [136] Grattan's \"Life and Times,\" vol. v. p. 417.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHATHAM\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAINTING BY WILLIAM HOARE, R.A., IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT\r\nGALLERY]\r\n\r\nMen in the House of Commons, as Bolingbroke said, \"grow, like hounds,\r\nfond of the man who shows them sport, and by whose halloos they are\r\nused to be encouraged.\" If, in addition, the Prime Minister possesses\r\nsingleness of purpose and supreme self-confidence, his power in\r\nParliament is supreme. The \"Great Commoner\" owed his political success\r\nas much to his courage and assurance as to his splendid gifts as an\r\norator. \"I know that I can save the country,\" he once observed to the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, \"and I know that no other man can!\"[137] The Duke\r\nof Cumberland, a political adversary, described him very justly when\r\nhe said that he was \"that rare thing--a man!\" His position in the\r\nHouse of Commons was in many ways unique. His very presence seemed to\r\ninstil fear into the hearts of his opponents, and promote confidence\r\nin those of his supporters. A member named Moreton, Chief Justice of\r\nChester, in a speech in the Lower House, once made some allusion to\r\n\"King, Lords, and Commons, or, as that Right Honourable\r\nMember\"--looking across at Pitt--\"would call them, Commons, Lords, and\r\nKing!\" The Prime Minister rose at once in that slow dignified manner\r\nwhich always commanded silence, and, fixing the speaker with a cold\r\nand terrifying gaze, asked the Clerk of the House to make a note of\r\nMoreton's words. \"I have heard frequently in this house doctrines\r\nthat have surprised me,\" he said; \"but now my blood runs cold!\"\r\nMoreton, in some alarm, hastened to apologise for his ill-chosen\r\nwords, saying that he had intended nothing offensive. \"King, Lords,\r\nand Commons; Lords, King, and Commons; Commons, Lords, and King--_tria\r\njuncta in uno_! Indeed, I meant nothing!\" he explained. Pitt gravely\r\naccepted this apology, but took the opportunity of giving the\r\ntrembling Moreton some very sound advice. \"Whenever that honourable\r\ngentleman means nothing,\" he said, in his sternest and most frigid\r\ntones, \"I strongly recommend him to say nothing!\"\r\n\r\n  [137] Hayward's \"Biographical Essays,\" vol. ii. p. 39.\r\n\r\nThe terror he inspired among his opponents was shown on another\r\noccasion when he replied to an attack of Murray, the Solicitor-General,\r\nafterwards Lord Mansfield. \"I must now address a few words to Mr.\r\nSolicitor,\" said Pitt; \"they shall be few, but they shall be daggers!\"\r\nMurray at once became much agitated. \"Judge Festus trembles,\"\r\ncontinued Pitt relentlessly, pointing his finger on him. \"He shall\r\nhear me some other day.\" He sat down, Murray made no reply, and a\r\nlanguid debate showed the paralysis of the House.[138]\r\n\r\n  [138] Butler's \"Reminiscences,\" pp. 154-157.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in Parliament that Pitt's power made itself felt, or\r\nthat his words were received with a kind of reverential awe bordering\r\non terror. Government officials knew well that he was not a man to be\r\ntrifled with, or, if they did not know it, he soon found occasion to\r\nbring the fact to their notice. Once, when he had sent a message to\r\nthe Admiralty saying that the Channel Fleet was to be got ready to\r\nsail on the following Tuesday, the Board of Admiralty respectfully\r\nreplied that such a thing was an impossibility; the time was too\r\nshort. The Prime Minister drily rejoined that in that case he would\r\nrecommend the King to name a new Board of Admiralty. Needless to say,\r\nthe Channel Fleet sailed on Tuesday.[139]\r\n\r\n  [139] Russell's \"Recollections,\" p. 263.\r\n\r\nPitt, indeed, possessed all the attributes of a successful Prime\r\nMinister. He was himself infused with a fervid enthusiasm which he\r\ncould transmit into the hearts of all who shared his confidences. His\r\ncourage was infectious. No man, said Colonel Barré, could come out of\r\nthe Minister's private room without feeling himself braver than when\r\nhe entered. He was gifted with a serene composure, a perfect\r\nself-possession, and understood the House of Commons as well as did\r\nDisraeli after him, and as well as Lord Salisbury understood the\r\nLords.\r\n\r\nBoth these two last statesmen possessed that polished style, dry\r\nhumour and sarcasm which are beloved of parliamentary audiences.\r\nDisraeli was the more ornamental speaker of the two, but seldom wasted\r\ntime in rhetoric, and, like Lord North, never weakened his argument by\r\nsuperfluous declamation. One of the secrets of his success was that he\r\nknew when to keep silent--knowledge that is of infinite importance to\r\na Prime Minister. Gladstone--great as a Premier, and still greater as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer--could not always stay his speech. His\r\nearnestness and enthusiasm carried him away, and he thereby often\r\ndissipated in debate those powers which his rival was reserving for\r\ngreat occasions. Lord Salisbury adopted a studiously common-place tone\r\nin the House; he did not orate, he talked confidentially. And\r\nParliament has always preferred this quiet fashion of speaking, to\r\nwhat Dizzy once called the \"somewhat sanctimonious eloquence\" of\r\nGladstone. Lord Palmerston's jaunty manner was far more popular than\r\nthe exuberant eloquence of greater orators. People said that they\r\npreferred his \"ha! ha!\" style to the wit of Canning or the gravity of\r\nPeel.\r\n\r\nThe Premiership is not a bed of roses, and it requires the phlegm of a\r\nLord North to sleep there at all. It is, no doubt, the pinnacle of\r\npolitical ambition, but from that giddy height many a statesman has\r\nlooked down with envy, like St. Simon on his column, at the\r\ngroundlings who walk securely beneath his feet. Elevation brings with\r\nit many disadvantages. The searchlight of public opinion beats\r\nrelentlessly upon a Prime Minister; even his private life is open to\r\ncriticism. Enemies lay snares for him on every side; friends and\r\npolitical allies have to be treated with tact and tenderness; his\r\nlabours never cease, day or night.[140] It is his duty, as Gladstone\r\nsaid, \"to stand like a wall of adamant between the people and the\r\nsovereign,\" and the burden of an Empire hangs heavy upon his\r\nshoulders. From the very moment of a Prime Minister's appointment his\r\nresponsibilities commence. Entrusted by the sovereign with the\r\ndelicate duty of forming a Ministry, he is at once faced with a task\r\nof exceptional difficulty. Whom shall he choose? This problem awaits\r\nhis instant solution. Luckily, as Bagehot says, the position of most\r\nmen in Parliament forbids their being invited to the Cabinet, while\r\nthat of a few men ensures their being invited.[141] Between the\r\ncompulsory list, whom he must take, and the impossible list, whom he\r\ncannot take, a Prime Minister's independent choice is not very large;\r\nit extends rather to the division of the Cabinet offices than to the\r\nchoice of Cabinet Ministers.\r\n\r\n  [140] Among the unpublished manuscripts at Welbeck Abbey are some\r\n  private notes made by the Duke of Portland, who was Prime Minister in\r\n  1783, suggesting methods of treatment suitable for various political\r\n  allies at the time of the Coalition Ministry. The following extracts\r\n  are of interest:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Salisbury. Irish jobs.\r\n\r\n    Lord Thanet. Personal attention.\r\n\r\n    Lord Cornwallis. Should be spoken to: has two members in the\r\n    House of Commons.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon. Anything for himself or Lord Hyde.\r\n\r\n    Lord Wentworth. Wants something. He voted against.\r\n\r\n    Duke of Argyle. Great attention. Scotch jobs.\r\n\r\n    Gen. Luttral. To be sent for next session. Lord Temple should not\r\n    be allowed all the merit of the job that we done for him lately.\r\n\r\n    Gen. Vaughan. Quebec, or a Command anywhere.\r\n\r\n    Lord Westcote. Distant hopes of a Peerage.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gibbon. Will vacate his seat for an employment out of Parliament:\r\n    very much wished by Lord Loughborough.\"\r\n\r\n  (N.B.--This Gibbon is the historian.)\r\n\r\n  [141] \"Fortnightly Review,\" No. I, p. 10.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of places is, however, an invidious duty; there are\r\nso many reasons governing a Premier's choice of his colleagues.\r\nValuable services to the party have to be rewarded; the claims of men\r\nwho have held Cabinet rank in former Governments cannot be\r\ndisregarded; the wishes of the Sovereign must be considered.[142] To\r\nsatisfy all who expect office is impossible; to satisfy the few who\r\ndeserve it is a laborious and not altogether grateful business. The\r\nstatesman whom it is proposed to appoint as Minister for War may yearn\r\nfor the Lord Chancellorship; the prospective President of the Board of\r\nTrade desires to become Irish Secretary. It is for the Prime Minister,\r\nby coaxing or entreaties, to content them both. But there are less\r\npleasant duties than this to perform. Certain ex-Cabinet Ministers who\r\nhave not proved a success in their various departments must be shelved\r\nwith as little damage to their feelings as possible; salves in the\r\nform of peerages must be administered to other aggrieved politicians\r\nwho have been left out. At times ex-Ministers who are no longer\r\nmembers of the Cabinet have shown signs of disinclination to retire.\r\nIn 1801, for instance, when Addington became Prime Minister, Lord\r\nLoughborough, who had been Chancellor in Pitt's administration,\r\nresigned the Great Seal, but continued to attend Cabinet meetings, and\r\nAddington was eventually compelled to write and ask him to deprive the\r\nCabinet of the pleasure of his distinguished presence.[143]\r\n\r\n  [142] The necessity of pleasing George III. compelled many Prime\r\n  Ministers to include his friend Addington in their administrations,\r\n  and inspired Canning to remark that this Minister was like the\r\n  small-pox, which everybody was obliged to have once in their lives.\r\n\r\n  [143] Campbell's \"Lives of the Chancellors,\" vol. v. p. 327.\r\n\r\nThe manner of appointing a Minister, as also the manner of acquainting\r\na colleague that his services are no longer required, varies with\r\ndifferent Premiers. One may be as curt in his methods of appointment\r\nas another is in his mode of dismissal. Walpole and North provide\r\nexcellent examples of this. On the death of Lord Chancellor Talbot in\r\n1736-7, Walpole offered the Great Seal to Lord Hardwicke who was then\r\nLord Chief Justice. The latter hesitated about accepting the office,\r\nuntil one day the Prime Minister impatiently informed him that unless\r\nhe made up his mind without any further delay, the Seal would be\r\ngiven to Fazakerley, another famous lawyer. Hardwicke remonstrated\r\nthat Fazakerley was quite unfit for the post of Lord Chancellor, being\r\nboth a Tory and a Jacobite. \"Never mind,\" replied Walpole, pulling out\r\nhis watch. \"It is now exactly noon. If you do not let me know that you\r\nhave closed with my offer before eight o'clock this evening, I can\r\nonly tell you that, by twelve, Fazakerley will be as good a Whig as\r\nany man in His Majesty's dominions!\" Hardwicke hesitated no\r\nlonger.[144]\r\n\r\n  [144] \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. iii. p. 486.\r\n\r\nLord North's method of dismissing Fox from his Cabinet in 1774 was no\r\nless peremptory. \"Sir,\" wrote the Prime Minister, \"His Majesty has\r\nthought proper to order a new commission of the Treasury to be made\r\nout, in which I do not perceive your name.\"[145]\r\n\r\n  [145] \"History of the Political Life of C. J. Fox,\" pp. 76-7.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that a Prime Minister can give complete satisfaction in\r\nthe formation of a Ministry, though the task is perhaps lightened by\r\nthe fact that the possession of rare ability is not an absolute\r\nnecessity for a Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the Prince Consort sent Lord Derby the examination papers\r\nwhich Prince Alfred had been set when he passed as a naval cadet \"As I\r\nlooked over them,\" wrote the Prime Minister in his reply, \"I couldn't\r\nbut feel very grateful that no such examination was necessary to\r\nqualify Her Majesty's Ministers for their offices, as it would very\r\nseriously increase the difficulty of framing an administration!\"\r\n\r\nA curious list, as Macaulay suggested, could be made out of successful\r\nLord Chancellors ignorant of the principles of equity, and of First\r\nLords of the Admiralty ignorant of the principles of navigation.\r\nSheridan even went so far as to say that a competent knowledge of the\r\nRule of Three was a sufficient qualification for the Chancellorship of\r\nthe Exchequer. Fox never understood what was meant by Consols. He only\r\nknew them to be things which rose and fell, and he was delighted when\r\nthey fell, because, as he said, it annoyed Pitt so much. Lowe, who\r\ntook a gloomy view of his office,[146] always admitted that he was \"a\r\nbad hand at figures,\" and his financial statements as Chancellor were\r\nboth obscure and unintelligible. Lord Randolph Churchill, too, when he\r\nwas at the Treasury, is always supposed to have remarked to a clerk\r\nwho brought him a list of decimal figures, that he \"never could\r\nunderstand what those d----d dots meant!\"\r\n\r\n  [146] \"The Chancellor of the Exchequer exists to distribute a certain\r\n  amount of human misery,\" he once remarked, \"and he who distributes it\r\n  most equally is the best Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\nGovernment departments are to a great extent run by the permanent\r\nofficials. As Sir George Lewis, himself successively Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, Home Secretary, and Minister for War, justly observed, it\r\nis not the business of a Cabinet Minister to work his department. His\r\nbusiness is to see that it is properly worked. If he does too much, he\r\nis probably doing harm. The permanent staff of the office can do what\r\nhe chooses to do much better than he, or, if they cannot, they ought\r\nto be removed. Strength of purpose, quickness of decision, and a good\r\nsupply of sterling common-sense are worth more to a Minister than mere\r\ntechnical knowledge.[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] See Bagehot's \"English Constitution,\" p. 200.\r\n\r\nBesides the appointment of his colleagues, the Prime Minister also has\r\nin his patronage a number of posts in the Royal Household, which\r\nbecome vacant when an Administration changes. These are not so\r\ndifficult to fill, and are usually distributed among members of the\r\nHouse of Lords, who are thus bound to their party by ties even\r\nstronger than those of sentiment.[148]\r\n\r\n  [148] Among the offices in the Royal Household which are filled by the\r\n  Prime Minister, the most important are those of the Master of the\r\n  Horse, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain, the seven Lords in\r\n  Waiting, and the Mistress of the Robes.\r\n\r\nThe actual Ministry consists of over forty persons, of whom perhaps a\r\nquarter form the Cabinet.[149] The annual cost to the country in\r\nministerial salaries is well under £200,000, and cannot therefore be\r\nconsidered excessive, considering the delicacy of the administrative\r\nmachine, the efficiency with which it is run, and the amount of work\r\nthat has to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n  [149] A complete list of the salaries and offices of Ministers does\r\n  not lie within the scope of this volume. It will be sufficient to\r\n  enumerate briefly the most important members of the administration.\r\n  First in order of precedence stand the Prime Minister, the Lord High\r\n  Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal (an\r\n  office to which, like that of the Prime Minister, no salary is\r\n  attached), and the First Lords of the Treasury and Admiralty. After\r\n  these come the five Secretaries of State: for Home Affairs, Foreign\r\n  Affairs, the Colonies, War, and India. These are followed by the\r\n  Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaries for Scotland and Ireland,\r\n  the Postmaster-General, the Presidents of the Board of Trade, Local\r\n  Government Board, Board of Agriculture, and Board of Education, the\r\n  Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the First Commissioner of\r\n  Works. There are, besides, eight Parliamentary Under-Secretaries, four\r\n  Junior Lords of the Treasury (one of whom is unpaid), a Patronage\r\n  Secretary, a Financial Secretary, a Paymaster-General,\r\n  Attorney-General, and Solicitor-General. Scotland is represented by a\r\n  Lord-Advocate and a Scottish Solicitor-General; Ireland by a\r\n  Lord-Lieutenant, a Lord Chancellor, an Attorney-General, and a\r\n  Solicitor-General.\r\n\r\nThe labours of Cabinet Ministers have increased enormously in modern\r\ntimes. This is perhaps one of the reasons why they no longer deem it\r\nnecessary to attend debates as regularly as their predecessors. In\r\nDisraeli's time all the members of the Cabinet sat on the Treasury\r\nBench throughout a debate, and listened attentively to every speech.\r\nIt was considered obligatory upon the Leader of the House to be\r\npresent perpetually in his place in Parliament. Neither Gladstone nor\r\nDisraeli would have thought of leaving the Chamber, except for a\r\nhurried dinner, until the House rose. The sittings have become so\r\nlengthy of late that it would be impossible for any Minister thus to\r\ngive up his whole time to debate. Ministers are consequently provided\r\nwith private rooms within the precincts of the House, whither they\r\nbetake themselves as soon as question time is over, leaving one or two\r\nof their number to act as sentinels.\r\n\r\nThe cup of a young politician's happiness is filled to the brim on\r\nthat glad day when he is offered a post in the Ministry. It does not\r\nactually overflow until he has been given a seat in the Cabinet\r\nitself. Should such success attend him, the summit of his ambition is\r\nwithin sight. In imagination he sees the mantle of Walpole descending\r\nupon his shoulders. Before his eyes stretches a vista of political\r\nsplendour which only reaches a glorious conclusion when the vaults of\r\nWestminster Abbey open to receive his ashes. There is but one fly in\r\nthe ointment. A member of the House of Commons who is appointed to\r\nministerial office has perforce to submit himself once more to the\r\njudgment of the electors, and beg his constituents to return him again\r\nto Parliament. This rule is some two centuries old, and was designed\r\nto prevent the corruption of unworthy members who might otherwise be\r\nbought by the offer of lucrative Crown appointments.[150] It is no\r\nlonger of any practical value for this purpose, and so tiresome a\r\npractice, entailing as it does much hardship and expense upon a newly\r\ncreated Minister, could well be abolished. Old customs die hard,\r\nhowever, and nowhere do they take so \"unconscionably long a time\r\na-dying\" as in Parliament.\r\n\r\n  [150] Exceptions are made by Statute in favour of the Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury and some other officers, or of a Minister who is transferred\r\n  from one office to another in the same Administration.\r\n\r\nThe ratification by the sovereign of the Prime Minister's choice in\r\nthe matter of colleagues is a brief but not unimposing ceremony. To\r\neach of the three Secretariats of State there belongs a seal which is\r\nthe outward and visible sign of the authority attaching to the post.\r\nWhen a Government goes out of office and a fresh Ministry is\r\nappointed, the seals are delivered up in person to the sovereign by\r\nthe outgoing Ministers. His Majesty then hands them to the members of\r\nthe new Administration, who receive their badges of office in a\r\nsuitably humble attitude, on their knees, and kiss the royal hand that\r\nconfers these favours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CABINET MEETING (THE COALITION MINISTRY OF 1854)\r\n\r\nFROM THE DRAWING BY SIR JOHN GILBERT]\r\n\r\nThe seals of office have been the unconscious cause of more\r\nindifferent puns than any other parliamentary institution. Statesmen\r\nwho have never previously been guilty of a sense of humour, and have\r\notherwise led blameless lives, seem unable to refrain from making\r\nlittle jokes on the subject of seal fisheries--jokes which their\r\nbiographers affectionately enshrine as epigrams in their published\r\nLives.[151] We have fortunately outgrown such humour as this, and puns\r\nare nowadays only to be found elsewhere among the _obiter dicta_ of\r\nour judges and magistrates upon their respective benches.\r\n\r\n  [151] Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal are very prone to\r\n  puns. When Lord Campbell replaced Lord Plunket as Chancellor of\r\n  Ireland he had to cross the Channel in a storm. Plunket's secretary\r\n  remarked that if the new Chancellor were not drowned, he would be very\r\n  sick. \"Perhaps,\" said Plunket, \"he'll throw up the seals!\" Lord\r\n  Chancellor Westbury once told an eminent counsel that he was getting\r\n  as fat as a porpoise. \"In that case,\" replied the other, \"I am\r\n  evidently a fit companion of the great Seal.\" Lord Lyndhurst is\r\n  another Chancellor who made a joke of this sort. There must be\r\n  something, too, in the atmosphere of a change of Ministry which evokes\r\n  bad puns. When Disraeli was appointed to Lord Derby's Cabinet in 1852,\r\n  more than one eminent politician facetiously remarked that now\r\n  Benjamin's mess would be five times as great as that of the others.\r\n  And, fourteen years later, when the same statesman was bidden to form\r\n  a Ministry of his own, Lord Chelmsford, whom he had relieved of the\r\n  Chancellorship of the Exchequer, shamelessly observed that if the old\r\n  Government was \"the Derby,\" this new one was certainly \"the Hoax\" (see\r\n  Martin's \"Life of Lyndhurst,\" p. 481 n., and the \"Life of Lord\r\n  Granville,\" vol. i. p. 479, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe Ministry is now formed. The Prime Minister moves into Downing\r\nStreet; his colleagues hasten to make themselves acquainted with the\r\nwork of their various departments. The parliamentary concert is about\r\nto commence, and it is for the Premier as leader of the Government\r\norchestra to keep his band together as best he may. This is no easy\r\ntask. A single false note may mar the harmony of the whole\r\nperformance; the failure of one solitary instrumentalist may cause the\r\ndismissal of the entire band. It is the conductor's duty to see that\r\nhis orchestra plays in unison, or, if not in unison, at least in\r\nharmony. He must keep a watchful eye upon each individual, and quash\r\nthe efforts of any one member to perform a solo upon his own peculiar\r\ntrumpet. All round the platform sit the members of a former band,\r\nstern critics anxious to seize the instruments from the hands of their\r\nrivals and show the public how the tune should be played. Their\r\nchance will soon arrive. For when the concert has gone on sufficiently\r\nlong, the popular audience grows weary of the performance and demands\r\nsomething fresh. Another conductor is chosen, and another orchestra\r\nengaged to play. The old band is dismissed, and its members are free\r\nto return to their former avocations, wiser no doubt, but perhaps\r\npoorer men.[152] But though from Parliament to Parliament the\r\nperformers may vary and the leaders change, the music remains very\r\nmuch the same; and, while the country enjoys the privilege of paying\r\nthe piper, it is generally the piper who calls the tune.\r\n\r\n  [152] If Pitt had been dismissed from office \"after more than five\r\n  years of boundless power,\" says Macaulay, \"he would hardly have\r\n  carried out with him a sum sufficient to furnish a set of chambers in\r\n  which, as he cheerfully declared, he meant to resume the practice of\r\n  the Law.\"--\"Miscellaneous Writings,\" p. 347.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LORD CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Sir Thomas More to the present time the Woolsack has\r\ncontinuously enriched the annals of English history with famous and\r\ndistinguished names. The well-known biographies of Lord Campbell,\r\nwhose habit of writing the lives of the deceased as soon as the breath\r\nwas out of their bodies added, as Brougham declared, a new terror to\r\ndeath, supply abundant evidence of the statesmanlike qualities that\r\nattach to the holders of the office. The most eminent men of their day\r\nhave held the Chancellorship, proving the truth of Burke's well-known\r\nassertion that of all human studies the law is the most efficacious in\r\nforming great men, and that to be well versed in the laws of England\r\nis to be imbued in the sublimest principles of human wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe office of Chancellor is of very ancient origin.[153] It existed in\r\nEngland in the days of the Anglo-Saxon kings, when the official who\r\nacted as judicial secretary or clerk to the sovereign is supposed to\r\nhave derived his title from the _cancelli_ or screens behind which he\r\ncarried on his clerical duties.\r\n\r\n  [153] Lord Ellesmere observes that in the 8th Chapter of Samuel,\r\n  Jehoshaphat the son of Abilud, the Chancellor among the Hebrews, was\r\n  called \"Mazur,\" which, translated into English, becomes \"Sopher,\" or\r\n  Recorder. \"Whether the Lord Chancellor of _England_ as now he is, may\r\n  be properly termed _Sopher_ or Mazur, it may receive some needlesse\r\n  question, howbeit it cannot be doubted but his office doth participate\r\n  of both their Functions.\"--\"Observations concerning the Office of Lord\r\n  Chancellor,\" p. 2.\r\n\r\nAfter their conversion to Christianity, the kings employed the\r\nservices of a priest as chaplain or confessor, and in the person of\r\nthe Chancellor the posts of \"Keeper of the King's Conscience\" and\r\nsecretary were thus naturally combined. In King Ethelred's time the\r\nChancellorship was divided between the Abbots of Ely, Canterbury and\r\nGlastonbury, who exercised it in turn, each for four months.\r\n\r\nThe appointment continued for several centuries to be held by a\r\ncleric. In the early days of Parliament, indeed, the Chancellor\r\nreceived his writ of summons as a Bishop and not as Chancellor, and,\r\nthough he attended in the latter capacity in any case, no summons was\r\nsent to him if he did not happen to be a bishop. Ecclesiastics were\r\nappointed to the Chancellorship, without exception, until the time of\r\nSir Robert Bourchier in 1340, and it was not for a long time after\r\nthis that spiritual statesmen wholly gave place to lawyers. Thomas à\r\nBeckett, William of Wykeham and Cardinal Wolsey, figure prominently\r\namong the clerical Chancellors of early times, and it was not until\r\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century that laymen succeeded in\r\nestablishing themselves firmly upon the Woolsack. Since that time no\r\ncleric, with the single exception of Bishop Williams, in 1621, has\r\nbeen entrusted with the Chancellorship or the custody of the Great\r\nSeal.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief duties of the Chancellor in early times consisted in\r\naffixing the royal Seal with which from time immemorial the will of\r\nthe sovereign has been expressed. At the present day Royal grants and\r\nwarrants, Letters-Patent of Peerage or for inventions, Commissions of\r\nthe Peace, etc., are issued under what Coke calls the _Clavis Regni_.\r\nWhen the sovereign is absent it acts as his representative, and\r\nParliament itself is opened by a Commission under the Great Seal. This\r\nemblem of sovereignty may therefore be considered one of the most\r\nimportant instruments of the Constitution, and, as its loss would\r\nentail endless inconvenience, it is given into the custody of the Lord\r\nKeeper or Lord Chancellor.[154] As secretary to the King the\r\nChancellor would seem to have been its natural custodian, but when he\r\nfell sick or died, or went abroad, it was occasionally placed in other\r\nhands. Later on it became the custom to make the Keepership of the\r\nGreat Seal a regular appointment, separate and distinct from the Lord\r\nChancellorship.\r\n\r\n  [154] The Seal was stolen from Lord Thurlow by burglars in 1784, and\r\n  the offer of a reward of £200 failed to retrieve it. When Lord\r\n  Chancellor Eldon's house at Encombe caught fire in 1812, he buried the\r\n  Seal for safety's sake in the garden, and then forgot where he had\r\n  buried it. His family spent most of the next day digging for it before\r\n  it was finally recovered. Eldon seems to have taken the fire very\r\n  easily. \"It really was a very pretty sight,\" he wrote, \"for all the\r\n  maids turned out of their beds, and formed a line from the water to\r\n  the fire-engine, handing the buckets; they looked very pretty, _all in\r\n  their shifts_.\" Campbell's \"Lives of the Chancellors,\" vol. vii. p.\r\n  300.\r\n\r\nThe post of Lord Keeper has been held by statesmen, courtiers, and\r\ndivines, and the duties of the office have even been undertaken on two\r\noccasions by women. Queen Eleanor, the first Lady Keeper, was also the\r\nmost unpopular. While her husband was abroad in 1253, and the Great\r\nSeal was in her custody, she made use of her delegated power to lay a\r\nheavy tax on all vessels bearing cargo to London, and showered gifts\r\nof English land and places upon her foreign relatives. She thus\r\nsucceeded in arousing the hatred of the London mob, who expressed\r\ntheir dislike in a material fashion by pelting her with mud. To avoid\r\nthe fury of the populace Queen Eleanor fled abroad, and only returned\r\nto England to take refuge in a convent.[155] The other Lady Keeper,\r\nQueen Isabella, who held the Great Seal in 1321, had no actual\r\ncommission, and was not entrusted with any judicial power. But she\r\nkept the Seal in a casket, and delivered it each day as it was\r\nrequired to the Master of the Rolls, and may therefore claim to be\r\nincluded in the list of Keepers.\r\n\r\n  [155] Queen Eleanor was a remarkable woman. At the age of thirteen she\r\n  was the author of a heroic poem, and in the following year became a\r\n  wife. Piers of Langtoft describes her as\r\n\r\n      \"The fayrest Maye in lyfe,\r\n      Her name Elinore of gentle nurture,\r\n      Beyond the sea there was no such creature.\"\r\n\r\nThe post of Lord Keeper and Lord Chancellor first became identical in\r\nQueen Elizabeth's time, when the Great Seal was entrusted to Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, who, with his son Sir Francis and the great Lord\r\nBurghley, may be considered the most eminent of Elizabethan\r\nChancellors. Sir Nicholas has been called an \"archpiece of wit and\r\nwisdom\",[156] and was also well suited physically to combine the two\r\nimportant offices. By nature a man of gigantic size, he grew more\r\nbulky with advancing years, and though his dignity was thus increased,\r\nthe progress of Chancery business suffered in proportion. When he took\r\nhis seat on the bench, after walking from the Court of Chancery to the\r\nStar Chamber, Sir Nicholas always spent some considerable time in\r\nrecovering his breath. The proceedings were accordingly delayed until\r\nhe had struck the ground three times with his stick as a signal that\r\nhe was in a condition to resume work. As was fitting in a man of his\r\nposition, Lord Keeper Bacon inspired intense awe amongst his\r\nsubordinates. Indeed, the reverence with which he was universally\r\nregarded eventually proved the indirect cause of his death. One day,\r\nwhile he was having his hair cut, he fell into a profound slumber,\r\nfrom which no one had the courage to rouse him. \"I durst not disturb\r\nyou,\" said the barber, when Sir Nicholas at last awoke, chilled to the\r\nbone. \"By your civility I lose my life,\" was the Lord Keeper's reply;\r\nand in a few days his prophecy was fulfilled. Though, with Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, the two posts of Keeper and Chancellor became united,\r\nit was not until the time of George III. that the modern system\r\noriginated of conferring the Great Seal and the title of Lord\r\nChancellor simultaneously.\r\n\r\n  [156] Naunton's \"Fragmenta Regalia,\" p. 38.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval days the Chancellorship and the Lord Keepership were often\r\nheld in conjunction with other offices. Stratford was Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury as well as Lord Chancellor in 1334, and, though his\r\necclesiastical duties were too onerous to permit of his discharging\r\nthe functions of the Lord Keepership, they did not prevent him from\r\nretaining to himself the fees of that office. In 1532, Thomas Audley,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons, was appointed Lord Keeper in\r\nsuccession to Sir Thomas More, and held both appointments\r\nsimultaneously until he was made Lord Chancellor. And as recently as\r\nthe reign of Charles II., a Prime Minister, the Earl of Clarendon,\r\ncombined the posts of Premier and Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe office of Lord Chancellor developed into one of primary importance\r\nin the time of Edward I., when, from being but a member of the _Aula\r\nRegis_, he became the president of a separate court, a Court of\r\nEquity. Law and Equity have, to a certain extent, been antagonistic\r\never since the days when kings were advised by clerics and opposed by\r\nlawyers. In the eyes of the latter Equity was often, as Selden says,\r\n\"a roguish thing,\" untrustworthy, and largely dependent upon the\r\nconscience of individual Chancellors, \"and as that is larger or\r\nnarrower, so is Equity.\" But however exaggerated the claim of Equity\r\nto be the \"law of God,\" \"the law of nature,\" or \"law of reason,\"[157]\r\nit has at least vindicated its position in the statutory enactment\r\nthat, where there is a conflict, its rules are to prevail over those\r\nof the Common Law.[158]\r\n\r\n  [157] \"The Fyrste Dyaloge in Englys, between a Doctoure of Dyvynyte\r\n  and a Student in the Lawes of England\" (1539).\r\n\r\n  [158] Judicature Act of 1873, section 24.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of some, at least, of England's early Lord Chancellors\r\npossessed peculiarly plastic qualities. They themselves were not\r\ninfrequently ignorant of the principles of law. Occasionally, too,\r\ntheir conduct and character were such that it is hard to imagine them\r\nas the fount of Equity or justice. Lord Wriothesley, Chancellor in\r\n1544, combined legal incompetence with the most intense religious\r\nbigotry.[159] Chancellor Sir Francis Bacon, philosopher, writer, and\r\nlawyer, whose name is one of the most famous in English history, was\r\nforced to plead guilty to a charge of \"corruption and neglect,\" for\r\nwhich offence he was deprived of the Great Seal, fined a sum of\r\n£40,000, and imprisoned in the Tower. A hundred years later Lord\r\nChancellor Macclesfield was impeached and fined for corrupt practices\r\nwith regard to the sale of Masterships in Chancery; while the brutal\r\nJeffreys, stained with the blood of hundreds of innocent and\r\ndefenceless persons, was another Lord Chancellor whose presence added\r\nnothing to the prestige of the Woolsack.[160]\r\n\r\n  [159] His barbarous treatment of the wretched Anne Askew is notorious.\r\n  For denying that the sacramental blood and wine lost their material\r\n  elements after consecration, Anne was condemned to be tortured, and\r\n  the Lord Chancellor with his own hands stretched the rack on which the\r\n  unfortunate woman was bound, in the hope of extracting a confession.\r\n  It must, however, be admitted that Wriothesley's heart was not\r\n  entirely impervious to emotion, for when, as Lord Chancellor, he\r\n  announced the death of Henry VIII. in the House of Lords, he could not\r\n  refrain from bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n  [160] He was, however, an able lawyer, and reserved his orgies for\r\n  private life. \"If my Lord Jefferies exceeded the bounds of temperance\r\n  now and then in an evening, it does not follow that he was drunk on\r\n  the bench or in council.\" (Campbell's \"Lives,\" vol. iii. p. 595\r\n  _note_.)\r\n\r\nMany centuries elapsed before the standard of judicial morality in\r\nEngland attained its present high level, but even in the earliest days\r\nof the Chancellorship we find occupants of the Woolsack combining\r\nlegal wisdom with particularly blameless lives. The great Sir Thomas\r\nMore, statesman and author, was as famous for the extreme simplicity\r\nof his habits as for the ability with which he despatched Chancery\r\nbusiness. The former virtue he almost carried to excess, and his\r\npractice of singing in the choir of the parish church at Chelsea,\r\ndressed in a surplice, surprised and even shocked his contemporaries.\r\n\"God's body!\" once exclaimed the Duke of Norfolk, seeing More thus\r\nattired and singing lustily; \"My Lord Chancellor a parish clerk! You\r\ndishonour the King and his office.\" \"Nay,\" replied More, \"Your Grace\r\nmay not think that the King, your master and mine, will be offended\r\nwith me for serving _his_ Master, or thereby account his office\r\ndishonoured,\" and he resumed his interrupted hymn.\r\n\r\nJeffreys' predecessor, Lord Guilford, who, as Campbell tells us, \"had\r\nas much law as he could contain,\" was another Chancellor of blameless\r\nmorals. In an age when the possession of a few redeeming vices was\r\nconsidered the mark of a gentleman, the purity of his conduct caused\r\nhim some natural unpopularity. Indeed, his friends strongly advised\r\nhim to take a mistress, if he did not wish to lose all interest at\r\nCourt, saying that people naturally looked suspiciously at a man who\r\ndeclined to follow the general practice and seemed to be continually\r\nreprehending them by his superior moral tone. Lord Guilford's enemies\r\neven sought to revenge themselves upon him by spreading reports\r\ncalculated to make him look ridiculous, and once, when the Lord Keeper\r\nhad gone to the city to see a rhinoceros which was on view there,\r\ncirculated a story to the effect that he had insisted upon riding this\r\nanimal down the street. Poor Lord Guilford was much annoyed; he was\r\nblessed with a most exiguous sense of humour, and could see nothing\r\namusing in so preposterous a suggestion. \"That his friends,\r\nintelligent persons, who must know him to be far from guilty of any\r\nchildish levity, should believe it, was what _roiled_ him\r\nextremely,\"[161] he declared.\r\n\r\n  [161] Roger North's \"Life of Lord Guilford,\" vol. ii. p. 167. (The\r\n  word _roiled_, so we are informed, was an import from the American\r\n  plantations.)\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Lord Chancellor are manifold and of supreme\r\nimportance. Lord Lyndhurst, who himself held the Seal three times, and\r\nis famous not only as an orator but also as the originator of the\r\npolicy of what is known as the Two Power Standard,[162] once said that\r\nthe Chancellor's work might be divided into three classes: \"first, the\r\nbusiness that is worth the labour done; second, that which does\r\nitself; and third, that which is not done at all.\"[163]\r\n\r\n  [162] \"If we wish to be in a state of security,\" he said, in 1859, \"if\r\n  we wish to maintain our great interests, if we wish to maintain our\r\n  honour, it is necessary that we should have a power measured by that\r\n  of any two possible adversaries.\"\r\n\r\n  [163] H. Crabb Robinson's \"Diary,\" vol. iii. p. 453.\r\n\r\nIn his Court of Chancery the Lord Chancellor formerly exercised a vast\r\njurisdiction. At one time all writs were issued from this Court, and\r\nhe was not only considered the guardian of all \"children, idiots, and\r\nlunatics,\" but, as Blackstone says, \"had the general superintendance\r\nof all charitable uses in the Kingdom,\" and was the visitor of all\r\nhospitals of royal foundation.[164] His former duties in these\r\nrespects have to some extent been delegated to other judges and\r\nofficers, acting in his name; the issuing of writs, though also in his\r\nname, has been transferred to the Central Office, and the jurisdiction\r\nof the Court of Chancery removed to the Chancery Division of the High\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\n\r\n  [164] \"Commentaries,\" vol. iii. p. 47.\r\n\r\nHis judicial position, however, is probably greater than ever. He is\r\nhead of the Law and of the Judges--a vast though still, perhaps,\r\ninadequate number--President of the High Court of Justice and of the\r\nCourt of Appeal, and, above all, of the highest and final Court of the\r\nrealm, the House of Lords. Here he sits continuously, with occasional\r\nexcursions to preside over the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\r\nto which come all appeals from India and the Colonies. As the only\r\nlegal member of the Cabinet, he is virtually chief law officer of the\r\nCrown, and questions of domestic or international law are submitted\r\nfor his advice by his colleagues, the heads of the other Departments\r\nof the Government. In his capacity of Keeper of the Great Seal he may\r\nnever leave the Kingdom, and is _ex officio_ Speaker of the House of\r\nLords, and must attend all its sittings. The Chancellor does not,\r\nhowever, enjoy rights similar to those of the Commons' Speaker; he is\r\nnot addressed in debate; he does not call upon peers to speak, and has\r\nno authority to settle questions of order.\r\n\r\nAs the Woolsack is not considered to be within the limits of the House\r\nof Lords, the fact of a Chancellor being a Commoner does not prevent\r\nhim from sitting there and discharging the duties of Speaker; but he\r\nmay not take any other part in the proceedings unless he be himself a\r\npeer. Only in recent times has the Chancellor been necessarily made a\r\npeer, and there exists no statutory restriction incapacitating any\r\nman, unless he be a Roman Catholic, from holding the office of Lord\r\nChancellor.[165]\r\n\r\n  [165] Sir Robert Harley, Chancellor in 1757, was not made a peer until\r\n  1764. In 1830, Brougham took his seat on the Woolsack as a Commoner,\r\n  and at least one other Chancellor has since followed his example.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of his powers as Speaker of the Lords owes its origin\r\nto the fact that, unlike the Chairman of the Commons, the Chancellor\r\nis always a partisan appointed by a particular Government, and retires\r\nwhen that Government goes out of office. As such, he takes an active\r\npart in debate, and, though much respect would be paid to his advice\r\non points of order, it need never be followed, and he has no power to\r\ndecide questions of procedure or to control the conduct of his fellow\r\npeers.\r\n\r\nThe first Chancellor of an actively partisan character was Lord\r\nThurlow--\r\n\r\n    \"The rugged Thurlow who with sullen scowl,\r\n    In surly mood, at friend or foe will growl\"--\r\n\r\nwhose well-known asperity had earned for him the title of \"the Tiger.\"\r\nIt was said of him that in the Cabinet he \"opposed everything,\r\nproposed nothing, and was ready to support anything.\" He was supposed\r\nto have derived his descent from Thurloe, Cromwell's secretary. \"There\r\nare two Thurlows in my county,\" he remarked, when questioned upon the\r\nsubject, \"Thurloe the secretary and Thurlow the carrier. I am\r\ndescended from the carrier.\"[166] His bad manners on the bench were\r\nproverbial, but not apparently incorrigible. Once at the commencement\r\nof the Long Vacation, when he was quitting the court without taking\r\nthe usual leave of the Bar, a young barrister whispered to a\r\ncompanion, \"He might at least have said 'D---- you!'\" Thurlow\r\noverheard the remark, returned to his place, and politely made his\r\nbow.[167] Eldon said of Thurlow that he was a sturdy oak at\r\nWestminster, but a willow at St James's, where he long figured as the\r\nintimate and grateful confidant of George III.[168]\r\n\r\n    \"Oft may the statesman in St Stephen's wave,\r\n    Sink in St. James's to an abject slave,\"\r\n\r\nbut Thurlow's attitude towards his royal master does not appear to\r\nhave been marked by extreme servility. Once, indeed, when the\r\nChancellor had taken some Acts to receive the royal assent, he read\r\none or two of them through to the King and then stopped. \"It's all\r\nd----d nonsense trying to make you understand this,\" said Thurlow,\r\nwith brutal frankness, \"so you had better consent to them at once!\"\r\nAnd if he adopted this tone to his King, it may be certain that his\r\nattitude towards his equals or inferiors was no less overbearing.\r\n\r\n  [166] Roscoe's \"Eminent British Lawyers,\" p. 258. Other Chancellors\r\n  were sprung from equally humble origin. Edward Sugden, afterwards Lord\r\n  St. Leonards, was the son of a barber. To him is attributed a repartee\r\n  similar to that made many years earlier by Colonel Birch, M.P., who\r\n  was taunted with having in his youth been a carrier. \"It is true, as\r\n  the gentleman says, I once was a carrier,\" replied Birch. \"But let me\r\n  tell the gentleman that it is very fortunate for him that he never was\r\n  a carrier; for, if he had been, he would be a carrier still.\" See\r\n  Burnet's \"History of His Own Time,\" p. 259.\r\n\r\n  [167] Hawkins's \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii. p. 312.\r\n\r\n  [168] He declared, on a famous occasion, that his debt of gratitude to\r\n  His Majesty was ample, for the many favours he had graciously\r\n  conferred upon him, which, when he forgot, might his God forget him!\r\n  Wilkes, who was present, muttered, \"God forget you! He will see you\r\n  d----d first!\" while Burke remarked that to escape the memory of the\r\n  Almighty would be the very best thing Thurlow could hope for.\r\n\r\nThurlow's character has been cruelly portrayed in the _Rolliad_ under\r\nthe heading:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"HOW TO MAKE A CHANCELLOR.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a man of great abilities, with a heart as black as his\r\ncountenance. Let him possess a rough inflexibility, without the least\r\ntincture of generosity or affection, and be as manly as oaths and\r\nill-manners can make him. He should be a man who should act\r\npolitically with all parties--hating and deriding every one of the\r\nindividuals who compose them.\"[169]\r\n\r\n  [169] Page 430.\r\n\r\nIf the Speaker of the Lords had been expected to conduct himself in a\r\nfashion similar to that of the Speaker of the Commons, Thurlow's\r\nbehaviour on the Woolsack would certainly have given rise to adverse\r\ncriticism. He was a frank and bitter partisan, and when some opponent\r\nhad spoken, would step forward on to the floor of the House and, as he\r\nhimself described it, give his adversary \"such a thump in the\r\nbread-basket\" that he did not easily recover from this verbal\r\nonslaught.[170] Thurlow's pet aversion was Lord Loughborough, his\r\nsuccessor on the Woolsack. When Loughborough spoke effectively upon\r\nsome subject opposed by Thurlow, who had not however taken the trouble\r\nto study it, the latter could be heard muttering fiercely to himself.\r\n\"If I was not as lazy as a toad at the bottom of a well,\" he would\r\nsay, \"I could kick that fellow Loughborough heels over head, any day\r\nof the week.\" And he was probably right, for Lord Loughborough was a\r\nnotoriously bad lawyer,[171] whereas his rival's sagacity almost\r\nrefuted Fox's celebrated saying that \"Nobody could be as wise as\r\nThurlow _looked_.\"\r\n\r\n  [170] Twiss's \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. i. p. 214.\r\n\r\n  [171] Lord Ellenborough was once asked by his hostess after dinner to\r\n  cease conversing with his host--a judge--and to give the ladies some\r\n  conversation, as he had been talking law long enough. \"Madam,\" he\r\n  replied, \"I beg your pardon; we have not been talking law, or anything\r\n  like law. We have been talking of one of the decisions of Lord\r\n  Loughborough.\"--Campbell's \"Lives,\" vol. vi. p. 251.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work accomplished by a Lord Chancellor depends very\r\nlargely upon the man himself, as we may see by comparing the two most\r\ndistinguished Chancellors of their day--Lord Eldon and Lord Brougham.\r\n\r\nEldon had worked his way laboriously from the very foot to the topmost\r\nrung of the legal ladder. It was his own early experiences that\r\ninspired him to say that nothing did a young lawyer so much good as to\r\nbe half-starved. And in action as well as in word he always maintained\r\nthat the only road to success at the Bar was \"to live like a hermit,\r\nand work like a horse.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in many ways an original character. He always wore his\r\nChancellor's wig in society, and was otherwise unconventional. One\r\nday, after reading much of \"Paradise Lost,\" he was asked what he\r\nthought of Milton's \"Satan.\" \"A d----d fine fellow,\" he replied; \"I\r\nhope he may win.\" In spite of this view, however, he was an extremely\r\nreligious man, though he did not attend divine service regularly.\r\nIndeed, when some one referred to him as a \"pillar of the church,\" he\r\ndemurred, saying that he might justly be called a _buttress_ but not\r\na pillar of the church, since he was never to be found inside it. He\r\nis probably the most typical Tory of the old school that can be found\r\nin political history. His conservatism was of an almost incredibly\r\nstandstill and reactionary character. As Walter Bagehot said of him in\r\na famous passage, he believed in everything which it is impossible to\r\nbelieve in--\"in the danger of Parliamentary Reform, the danger of\r\nCatholic Emancipation, the danger of altering the Court of Chancery,\r\nthe danger of altering the Courts of Law, the danger of abolishing\r\ncapital punishment for trivial thefts, the danger of making landowners\r\npay their debts, the danger of making anything more, the danger of\r\nmaking anything less.\"[172]\r\n\r\n  [172] Bagehot's \"Literary Studies,\" vol. i. p. 150.\r\n\r\nThough on political questions Eldon could make up his mind quickly\r\nenough, on the bench the extreme deliberation with which he gave\r\njudicial decisions was the subject of endless complaints. He agreed\r\nwith Lord Bacon that \"whosoever is not wiser upon advice than upon the\r\nsudden, the same man is not wiser at fifty than he was at\r\nthirty.\"[173] His perpetual hesitation in Court, the outcome of an\r\nintense desire to be scrupulously just, gave rise to attacks both in\r\nParliament and the press.[174]\r\n\r\n[173] Like Lord Bacon, too, he compiled an indifferent \"Anecdote\r\nBook.\" Bacon's \"Collection of Apothegms,\" was supposed to have been\r\ntaken down from his dictation all on \"one rainy day,\" but neither the\r\nbrevity of the time nor the inclemency of the weather is a sufficient\r\nexcuse for so poor a production.\r\n\r\n  [174] These occasionally took the form of lampoons in verse, such as\r\n  the following:--\r\n\r\n      THE DERIVATION OF CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n      \"The Chancellor, so says Lord Coke,\r\n      His _title_ from Cancello took;\r\n      And ev'ry cause before him tried\r\n      It was his duty to _decide_.\r\n      Lord Eldon, hesitating ever,\r\n      Takes it from Chanceler, to _waver_,\r\n      And thinks, as this may bear him out,\r\n      His bounden duty is to _doubt_.\"\r\n\r\n           Pryme's \"Recollections,\" p. 111.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD ELDON\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAINTING BY SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE, P.R.A., IN THE NATIONAL\r\nPORTRAIT GALLERY]\r\n\r\nA Commission was eventually appointed, ostensibly to inquire into the\r\nmeans by which time and expense might be saved to suitors in\r\nChancery--where, as Sydney Smith said, Lord Eldon \"sat heavy on\r\nmankind\"--but really to expose the dilatory methods of the Chancellor.\r\nEldon came well out of the inquiry, however, and it was proved that in\r\nthe twenty-four years during which he had held the Great Seal, but few\r\nof his decisions had been appealed against, and still fewer reversed.\r\n\r\nIf some fault could be found with Lord Eldon for being a slow if\r\nsteady worker, no such complaint could be levelled at the head of Lord\r\nBrougham. The latter, indeed, erred on the side of extreme haste, and\r\nwas as restless on the bench as Eldon was composed, and as ignorant\r\nand careless of his duties as his predecessor was learned and\r\nscrupulous. Brougham's cleverness, was, however, amazing. If he had\r\nknown a little law, as Lord St. Leonards dryly observed, he would have\r\nknown a little of everything. He has been called \"the most misinformed\r\nman in Europe,\" and in early life, when he was one of the original\r\nfounders of the _Edinburgh Review_, is said to have written a whole\r\nnumber himself, including articles upon lithotomy and Chinese music.\r\nHis ability and brilliance were unsurpassed, and his oratory was\r\nsuperb. His famous speech (as her Attorney-General) in defence of\r\nQueen Caroline was one of the finest forensic efforts ever heard in\r\nthe House of Lords.[175] His many talents have been epitomised in a\r\nfamous saying of Rogers: \"This morning Solon, Lycurgus, Demosthenes,\r\nArchimedes, Sir Isaac Newton, Lord Chesterfield, and a great many\r\nmore, went away in one post-chaise.\" Yet he was eminently unsuccessful\r\nas Chancellor, and his domineering fashion of treating his colleagues\r\nmade him extremely unpopular. Brougham's loquacity was intolerable,\r\nand his conceit immense. \"The Whigs are all cyphers,\" he once\r\ndeclared, \"and I am the only unit in the Cabinet that gives a value to\r\nthem.\" It must, however, be admitted that he was a great statesman if\r\nnot a great Chancellor, and that to his unique intellectual talents we\r\nowe in great measure the emancipation of the negro slave and the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n  [175] \"There never was anything like the admiration excited by\r\n  Brougham's speech. Lord Harrowby, G. Somerset, Mr. Montagu, and\r\n  Granville told me it was in eloquence, ability, and judicious\r\n  management beyond almost anything they ever heard.\"--Lady Granville's\r\n  \"Letters\" (to Lady G. Morpeth, 5 October, 1820), vol. i. p. 181.\r\n\r\nIn his lifetime, Brougham was almost universally disliked and feared.\r\n\"A 'B' outside and a wasp within,\" said some wag, pointing to the\r\nsimple initial on the panel of that carriage which Brougham invented,\r\nand which still bears his name.[176] And this was the popular view of\r\nthat Chancellor whom Sheil called \"a bully and a buffoon.\" Even his\r\nfriends distrusted him, and in 1835, when Lord Melbourne returned to\r\npower, the Great Seal, which Brougham had held but a year before, was\r\nnot returned to him, but was put into Commission. No reasons were\r\nassigned for this step, but they were sufficiently obvious. \"My\r\nLords,\" said Melbourne in the Upper House, when Brougham subsequently\r\nattacked him with intense bitterness, \"you have heard the eloquent\r\nspeech of the noble and learned Lord--one of the most eloquent he ever\r\ndelivered in this House--and I leave your Lordships to consider what\r\n_must be_ the nature and strength of the objections which prevent my\r\nGovernment from availing themselves of the services of such a\r\nman!\"[177] Perhaps one of the strongest objections was the intense\r\ndislike with which the ex-Chancellor was regarded by the King. This\r\nwas not lessened by the cavalier fashion in which Brougham treated his\r\nsovereign. When he was forced to return the Great Seal into the Royal\r\nhands in 1834, he did not deliver it in person, as was proper, but\r\nsent it in a bag by a messenger, \"as a fishmonger,\" says Lord\r\nCampbell, \"might have sent a salmon for the King's dinner!\"\r\n\r\n  [176] The Duke of Wellington once chaffed Brougham, saying that he\r\n  would only be known hereafter as the inventor of a carriage. The\r\n  Chancellor retorted by remarking that the Duke would only be\r\n  remembered as the inventor of a pair of boots. \"D---- the boots!\" said\r\n  Wellington. \"I had quite forgotten them; you have the best of it!\"\r\n\r\n  [177] Russell's \"Recollections,\" p. 138.\r\n\r\nA Privy Councillor, by virtue of his office, and \"Prolocutor of the\r\nHouse of Lords by prescription,\"[178] the Lord High Chancellor of\r\nGreat Britain occupies to-day the \"oldest and most dignified of the\r\nlay offices of the Crown.\" By ancient statute, to kill him is a\r\ntreasonable offence, and his post as Lord Keeper is not determined by\r\nthe demise of the Crown. He enjoys precedence after the Royal Family\r\nand the Archbishop of Canterbury, holds one of the most prominent\r\nplaces in the Cabinet, and is the highest paid servant of the Crown.\r\n\r\n  [178] Blackstone's \"Commentaries,\" vol. iii. p. 47.\r\n\r\nIn Henry I.'s time the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal was paid 5_s._ a\r\nday, and received a \"livery\" of provisions, a pint and a half of\r\nclaret, one \"gross wax-light\" and forty candle-ends. The Chancellor's\r\nperquisites used always to include a liberal supply of wine from the\r\nKing's vineyards in Gascony. At the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, he received a salary of £19,000; but Lord Eldon, in 1813,\r\ngave up £5000 of this to the Vice-Chancellor, and for a long time the\r\nWoolsack was worth £14,000 a year. A modern Chancellor's salary is\r\n£10,000--£5000 as Lord Chancellor, and £5000 as Speaker of the House\r\nof Lords--and he is further entitled to a pension of half that amount\r\non retirement.\r\n\r\nThe extensive patronage that attaches to the office adds much to its\r\nimportance. The Chancellor recommends the appointment of all judges of\r\nthe High Court and Court of Appeal, and is empowered to appoint or\r\nremove County Court judges and Justices of the Peace. He also has the\r\ngift of all Crown livings of £20 or under, according to the valuation\r\nmade in Henry VIII.'s reign, and of many other places.[179] One of\r\nhis perquisites is the Great Seal, which, when \"broken up,\" becomes\r\nthe property of the reigning Chancellor. The breaking up of the Great\r\nSeal is a simple ceremony which inflicts no actual damage upon the\r\narticle itself. Whenever a new Great Seal is adopted, at the beginning\r\nof a new reign, on a change of the royal arms, or when the old Seal is\r\nworn out, the sovereign gives the latter a playful tap with a hammer,\r\nand it is then considered to be useless, and becomes the property of\r\nthe Lord Chancellor. On the accession of William IV. a dispute arose\r\nbetween Lord Lyndhurst and Lord Brougham as to who should possess the\r\nold Seal. The former had been Chancellor when the order was made for\r\nthe engraving of the new Seal; the latter had occupied the Woolsack\r\nwhen the new Seal was finished and ordered to be put into use. The\r\nKing, to whom the question was referred, decided, with truly\r\nSolomonian sagacity, that the Seal should be divided between the two\r\nChancellors.[180]\r\n\r\n  [179] Lord Eldon, who dearly loved a joke, wrote as follows to his\r\n  friend, Dr. Fisher, of the Charter House, who had applied to him for a\r\n  piece of preferment then vacant--\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR FISHER,\r\n\r\n      \"I cannot, to-day, give you the preferment for which you ask.\r\n\r\n          \"I remain, your sincere friend,\r\n                   \"ELDON.\r\n                     \"_Turn over._\"\r\n\r\n    (On the other side of the page he added)\r\n            \"I gave it to you yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n                        \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 612.\r\n\r\n  [180] The same difficulty arose in 1878, when Queen Victoria solved it\r\n  by following the precedent set in 1831, and divided the Seal between\r\n  Lord Cairns and his predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe people of England, as Disraeli said some seventy years ago, have\r\nbeen accustomed to recognize in the Lord Chancellor a man of singular\r\nacuteness, of profound learning, and vast experience, who has won his\r\nway to a great position by the exercise of great qualities, by patient\r\nstudy, and unwearied industry. They expect to find in him a man who\r\nhas obtained the confidence of his profession before he challenges the\r\nconfidence of his country, who has secured eminence in the House of\r\nCommons before he has aspired to superiority in the House of Lords; a\r\nman who has expanded from a great lawyer into a great statesman, and\r\nwho \"brings to the Woolsack the commanding reputation which has been\r\ngained in the long and laborious years of an admired career.\"[181]\r\nSeldom, indeed, are the people of England disappointed.\r\n\r\n  [181] \"The Runnymede Letters,\" p. 230.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SPEAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of \"First Commoner of the Realm\" is, after that of Prime\r\nMinister, the most distinguished as well as the most difficult to\r\nwhich it is possible for any man to attain while still a member of\r\nParliament. A comparison of the two offices proves, in one respect at\r\nany rate, favourable to the former; for whereas it has been said that\r\nthe Premier \"can do nothing right,\" the Speaker can do no wrong. He\r\nmay indeed be considered to enjoy in the House the prerogative which\r\nthe sovereign is supposed to possess in the country. But it is not\r\nupon his presumable infallibility that the occupant of the Chair\r\nrelies to-day for the unquestioned honour and dignity of his position.\r\nIt is rather to the reputation for absolute integrity with which, for\r\nclose upon a hundred years, each Speaker in turn has been justly\r\ncredited, that he owes the tribute of esteem and respect, almost\r\namounting to awe, which is nowadays rightly regarded as his due. The\r\nreverence he now inspires is the product of many Parliaments; his\r\npresent state is the gradual growth of ages.\r\n\r\nFrom very early days, when the two Houses began to sit apart, the\r\nCommons must probably have always possessed an official who, in some\r\nmeasure, corresponded to the modern idea of a Speaker. And though Sir\r\nThomas Hungerford, elected to the Chair in 1377, was the first upon\r\nwhom that actual designation was bestowed, the Lower House undoubtedly\r\nemployed the services of a spokesman--or \"pourparlour,\" as he was\r\nthen called--at an even earlier date.[182]\r\n\r\n  [182] Hakewell gives a list of Hungerford's predecessors in the Chair,\r\n  which includes Sir Peter de la Mare, commissioned by Parliament to\r\n  rebuke Edward III. for his misconduct with Alice Perrers, and\r\n  imprisoned for so doing.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Speaker\" is perhaps a misleading one, since speaking must be\r\nnumbered among the least important of the many duties that centre\r\nround the Chair, though in bygone days it was customary for a Speaker\r\nto \"sum up\" at the close of the proceedings. Grattan's landlady used\r\nto complain feelingly that it was a sad thing to see her misguided\r\nyoung lodger rehearsing his speeches in his bedroom, and talking half\r\nthe night to some one whom he called \"Mr. Speaker,\" when there was no\r\nspeaker present but himself.[183] It is, however, as the mouthpiece of\r\nthe Commons, as one who speaks for, and not to, his fellow-members,\r\nand was long the only channel through which the Commons could express\r\ntheir views to the Crown, that the Speaker earns his title.\r\n\r\n  [183] Phillips's \"Curran and his Contemporaries,\" p. 88.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker may well be called the autocrat of the House; his word\r\nthere is law, his judgment is unquestioned, his very presence is\r\nevocative of a peculiar deference. He is at the same time the servant\r\nof the House, and, in the memorable words which Speaker Lenthall\r\naddressed to Charles I., has \"neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak\r\nbut as the House is pleased to direct.\" It is upon the good pleasure\r\nof the Commons that his power is based; by their authority alone he\r\nrules supreme.\r\n\r\nThe prestige which nowadays attaches to the office has been slowly\r\nevolved on parallel lines with the gradual public recognition of the\r\nnecessary impartiality of the Chair. In proportion as the Speaker\r\nbecame fair minded, the strength of his position was enhanced, until\r\nto-day the occupant of the Chair is as powerful as he is impartial.\r\n\r\nThat there was a time when he could not justly be accused of being\r\neither the one or the other is a matter of history. Speakers in the\r\npast displayed little of the dignity and none of the fairness to which\r\ntheir successors have now for so many generations accustomed us. They\r\nwere frequently subjected to intentional disrespect on the part of the\r\nunruly members of that assembly over which it was their duty to\r\npreside. In the early Journals of the House, for instance, we find a\r\nSpeaker complaining that a member had \"put out his tongue, and popped\r\nhis mouth with his finger, in scorn,\" at him.[184] And the worthy\r\nLenthall himself was much upset on one occasion when a member came\r\nsoftly up behind him, as he was engaged in putting a question to the\r\nvote, and shouted \"Baugh!\" in his ear, \"to his great terror and\r\naffrightment.\"[185] Even as recently as in the reign of George III.\r\nthe parliamentary debates were marked by perpetual altercations of an\r\nundignified and acrimonious description between the members and the\r\nChair.\r\n\r\n  [184] July 16, 1610.\r\n\r\n  [185] Palgrave's \"House of Commons,\" p. 51.\r\n\r\nThat such things would be impossible nowadays is the result not so\r\nmuch of an improvement in the manners of the House--though that may\r\nhave something to do with it--as in the complete change which has\r\ntaken place in the character of its Chairman.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the seventeenth century the Chair was to all intents\r\nand purposes in the gift of the Crown: its occupant was a mere\r\ncreature of the reigning sovereign. \"It is true,\" wrote Sir Edward\r\nCoke, in 1648, \"that the Commons are to chuse their Speaker, but\r\nseeing that after their choice the king may refuse him, for avoiding\r\nof expense of time and contestation, the use is that the king doth\r\nname a discreet and learned man whom the Commons elect.\"[186] The\r\nSpeaker was, indeed, nothing more nor less than the parliamentary\r\nrepresentative of the King, from whom he received salaried office and\r\nother material marks of the royal favour.\r\n\r\n  [186] \"The Institutes of the Laws of England,\" fourth part (1648), p.\r\n  8.\r\n\r\nIn Stuart days the Commons had grown so jealous of the influence of\r\nthe Crown, and found the Speaker's spying presence so distasteful,\r\nthat they often referred important measures to Giant Committees of\r\nwhich they could themselves elect less partial chairmen. That they\r\nwere justified in their fears is beyond doubt. In 1629, for example,\r\nSpeaker Finch, who was a paid servant of King Charles, declined to put\r\nto the House a certain question of which he had reason to believe that\r\nHis Majesty disapproved. Again and again he was urged to do his duty,\r\nbut tremblingly refused, saying that he dared not disobey the King. On\r\nbeing still further pressed, the timorous Finch burst into tears, and\r\nwould have left the Chair had not some of the younger and more\r\nhotheaded members seized and held him forcibly in his seat, declaring\r\nthat he should remain there until it pleased the House to rise.[187]\r\n\r\n  [187] Carlyle's \"Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell,\" vol. i. p.\r\n  88. Until comparatively recently it was not permissible for a Speaker\r\n  to leave the Chair until, at the instigation of some member, the\r\n  motion \"that this House do now adjourn\" had been put. In this\r\n  connexion a pathetic story is told of Speaker Denison. On one occasion\r\n  the House broke up rather hurriedly, and the necessary formula for\r\n  releasing the Speaker was forgotten. He was consequently compelled to\r\n  remain a lonely prisoner in the Chair until some good-natured member\r\n  could be brought back to set him free.\r\n\r\nEven in the days of the Commonwealth, the choice of a Chairman was not\r\nleft entirely to the independent will of the Commons, and Lenthall,\r\nhimself the first Speaker to treat the Crown with open defiance, owed\r\nhis election to the urgent recommendation of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe Chair did not altogether succeed in clearing itself of Court\r\ninfluence until the close of the seventeenth century, when the\r\nmemorable and decisive conflict between the Crown and the Commons took\r\nplace over the Speakership. The refusal of Charles II., in 1678-9, to\r\napprove of Sir Edward Seymour, the Commons' choice, aroused the most\r\nintense resentment in the breast of every member of the House, and was\r\nthe subject of many heated debates. Though the popular assembly had\r\neventually to bow to the royal will, the election of the King's\r\noriginal candidate was not pressed, and the Commons may be said to\r\nhave gained a moral victory. From that day to this no sovereign has\r\ninterfered in the election of a Speaker, nor since then has the Chair\r\never been filled by a royal nominee.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this great constitutional struggle between King and\r\nParliament, the Speaker gained complete independence of the royal\r\nwill, but he had still to acquire that independence of Party to which\r\nhe did not practically attain until after the Reform Act of 1832.\r\n\r\nFrom being the creature of the Crown, the Speaker developed into the\r\nslave of the Ministry, thus merely exchanging one form of servitude\r\nfor another. He was an active partisan, and, in some instances, openly\r\namenable to corruption. Sir John Trevor, the first Speaker to whom was\r\ngiven (by a statute of William III.) the title of \"first Commoner of\r\nthe realm,\" an able but unscrupulous man who began life in humble\r\ncircumstances as a lawyer's clerk, was actually found guilty of\r\nreceiving bribes, and forced to pronounce his own sentence.\r\n\"Resolved,\" he read from the Chair on March 12, 1695, \"that Sir John\r\nTrevor, Speaker of this House, for receiving a gratuity of 1000\r\nguineas from the City of London, after the passing of the Orphans\r\nBill, is guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour.\" This resolution was\r\ncarried unanimously, and on the following day, when Sir John should\r\nhave been in his place to put to the vote the question of his own\r\nexpulsion, he wisely feigned sickness, and was never more seen within\r\nthe precincts of the House.[188]\r\n\r\n  [188] After his dismissal from the House of Commons, Sir John Trevor\r\n  lived quietly at home and amassed money. His miserly habits became\r\n  notorious. Once when he was dining alone and drinking a bottle of\r\n  wine, a cousin was introduced by a side door. \"You rascal,\" said\r\n  Trevor to his servant; \"how dare you bring this gentleman up the back\r\n  stairs? Take him instantly down the back stairs and bring him up the\r\n  _front_ stairs!\" In vain did the cousin remonstrate. While he was\r\n  being ceremoniously conveyed down one staircase and up the other his\r\n  host cleared the dinner table, and he returned to find the bottles and\r\n  glasses replaced by books and papers. Campbell's \"Lives of the\r\n  Chancellors,\" vol. v. pp. 59-60.\r\n\r\nArthur Onslow, who was elected to the Chair in 1727, and filled it\r\nwith distinction for three and thirty years, has been called \"the\r\ngreatest Speaker of the century,\" and was the first to realise the\r\nabsolute necessity for impartiality. So determined was he to ensure\r\nhimself against any possible suspicion of bias that he insisted upon\r\nsacrificing that portion of his official salary which was customarily\r\npaid by the Government.\r\n\r\nExcellent though such an example must have been, it was many years\r\nafter Onslow's retirement before his successors ceased to display a\r\npartisan spirit wholly incompatible with the dignity of their office.\r\nSpeaker Grenville threatened to leave the Chair because the Ministry\r\nof the day refused to accelerate the promotion of a military relative\r\nof his; Addington frequently overlooked trifling breaches of the rules\r\nof procedure committed by his political chief and crony, Pitt; Abbot\r\ncontrived that the scheme for the threatened impeachment of Lord\r\nWellesley should prove abortive. It was the last-named Speaker,\r\nhowever, who unwittingly brought to a head the question of the\r\nimpartiality of the Chair, and thereby settled it once and for all.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1813, at the prorogation of Parliament, Speaker Abbot took\r\nit upon himself to deliver at the bar of the House of Lords a lengthy\r\nparty harangue on the subject of Catholic emancipation. This frank\r\nexposition of his private political views roused the indignation of\r\nthe Commons, who took an early opportunity of expressing their\r\ndisapproval of his conduct. Not even his friends could condone Abbot's\r\naction, and in April of the following year a resolution was moved in\r\nthe Commons gravely censuring him for his behaviour on this occasion.\r\nFor several hours he was forced to listen to criticisms and abuse from\r\nboth sides of the House, and though, as a matter of policy, the\r\nresolution was not carried, the Commons in the course of this debate\r\nproved beyond doubt their determination to secure the impartiality of\r\ntheir Chairman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES ABBOT (LORD COLCHESTER)\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAINTING BY JOHN HOPPNER, R.A., IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT\r\nGALLERY]\r\n\r\nThat they succeeded in accomplishing their purpose may be gauged\r\nfrom the conduct and character of Abbot's successors. So divorced from\r\nall political prejudice is the modern Speaker, that he does not deem\r\nit consistent with his position to enter the portals of any political\r\nclub of which he may happen to be a member. Even at a General Election\r\nhe steers as widely clear of politics as possible. It is not, indeed,\r\nusual for his candidature to be opposed at such a time--though an\r\nexception was made as recently as 1895, when Speaker Gully was forced\r\nto contest Carlisle--and though he may appeal in writing to his\r\nconstituents, he is not supposed to touch, in his election address,\r\nupon any political questions.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a Speaker may be summarized in a few words. As the\r\nrepresentative of the House he alone of the Commons is privileged to\r\ncommunicate direct with the Crown, either as the personal bearer of an\r\naddress, or at the bar of the House of Lords when the sovereign is\r\npresent.[189] As the mouthpiece of the House he delivers on its behalf\r\naddresses of thanks to whomever Parliament delights to honour; he\r\ncensures those who have incurred its displeasure. In his hands lies\r\nthe issuing of writs to fill parliamentary vacancies; he alone can\r\nsummon witnesses or prisoners to the bar of the House, or commit to\r\nprison those persons who have offended against its privileges. His\r\npowers have been greatly increased of late years by the discretion\r\ncommitted to him under various Standing Orders of accepting or\r\nrefusing motions for the closure of debate. It is, besides, a part of\r\nthe daily routine of the Chair to put questions to the vote, to\r\ndeclare the decision of the House, and, finally, to maintain order in\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n  [189] Sir Arnold Savage, Speaker in Henry VI.'s time, was so voluble,\r\n  and addressed the King so often, and at such length, that the latter's\r\n  patience became exhausted, and he asked that all requests from the\r\n  Commons might hereafter be addressed to him in writing.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully to accomplish the last-named duty is a matter that\r\nrequires all that a man has of tact, strength of character, and\r\npromptness of judgment. It is, above all things, necessary that by\r\nhis personal integrity he should gain the confidence of the House, so\r\nthat a willing acquiescence, and not a reluctant submission, may be\r\ngiven to the force of his decisions. He must, as Sir Robert Peel\r\ndeclared, have a mind capable of taking the widest view of political\r\nevents, but at the same time able \"to descend to the discussion of\r\nsome insulated principle, to the investigation of some trifling point\r\nof order, some almost obsolete form, or some nearly forgotten\r\nprivilege.\"[190]\r\n\r\n  [190] In 1818, on the election of Manners Sutton.\r\n\r\nEver ready to quell turbulence with a firm hand, he must yet display\r\nan habitual urbanity of manner calculated to soothe the nerves of an\r\nirritable or excited assembly. He must make up his mind calmly and\r\ndispassionately, but on the spur of the moment, and, once his judgment\r\nis formed, adhere to it inflexibly. Difficult questions arise for his\r\ndecision with startling rapidity; intricate points of order loom\r\nsuddenly forth from a clear sky; and any show of vacillation would\r\ntend very materially to weaken the Speaker's authority.\r\n\r\nWhen a member uses unparliamentary language, or makes a personal\r\nattack upon an opponent, the Speaker must summon his most persuasive\r\npowers to induce the culprit to withdraw the offensive words. At a\r\nmoment's notice he has to decide a matter between two eminent\r\ndebaters, who would be little likely to consult him on any private\r\noccasion, and give satisfaction to both. To a perpetual serenity, as a\r\nmember once said in describing the Speaker's office, he must add \"a\r\nfirmness of mind as may enable him to repress petulance and subdue\r\ncontumacy, and support the orders of the House, in whatever\r\ncontrariety of counsels, or commotion of debate, against all attempts\r\nat infraction or deviation.\"[191]\r\n\r\n  [191] Dr. Johnson's \"Debates in Parliament,\" vol. ii. p. 2.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, it may be urged that a Speaker should combine\r\nintellectual ability with those qualities of character which are the\r\nmark of what is called a \"gentleman\"--a term that has, perhaps, seldom\r\nbeen more aptly defined than in a speech in which Lord John Cavendish\r\nrecommended the claims of a candidate to fill the chair vacated by the\r\ndeath of Sir John Cust in 1770.[192]\r\n\r\n  [192] Of his nominee for the Speakership Lord John declared that he\r\n  had \"parts, temper, and constitution.\" \"And he has,\" he added,\r\n  \"besides the principle of common honesty, which would prevent him from\r\n  doing wrong, a principle of nice honour, which will always urge him to\r\n  do right. By honour I do not mean a fashionable mistaken principle,\r\n  which would only lead a man to court popular reputation, and avoid\r\n  popular disgrace, whether the opinion on which they are founded is\r\n  false or true; whether the conduct which they require is in itself\r\n  just or unjust, or its consequences hurtful or beneficial to mankind.\r\n  I mean a quality which is not satisfied with doing right, when it is\r\n  merely the alternative of doing wrong, which prompts a man to do what\r\n  he might lawfully and honestly leave undone; which distinguishes a\r\n  thousand different shades in what is generally denominated the same\r\n  colour, and is as much superior to a mere conformity to prescribed\r\n  rules as forgiving a debt is to paying what we owe.\" \"Parliamentary\r\n  History,\" vol. xvi. p. 737.\r\n\r\nThe physical qualifications necessary for the Speakership include a\r\nclear, resonant voice and a commanding presence. A little man with a\r\nflute-like falsetto might be endowed with the wisdom of Solomon and\r\nthe virtue of Cæsar's wife, and yet fail to claim the respect of the\r\nHouse, even though he contrived to render audible his shrill cries of\r\n\"Order!\" When Sergeant Yelverton was elected to the Chair in 1597, he\r\ndeclared that a Speaker ought to be \"a man big and comely, stately and\r\nwell spoken, his voice great, his carriage majestical, his nature\r\nhaughty, and his purse plentiful,\"[193] and, with the omission of the\r\nlast qualification, now no longer necessary, the same may truly be\r\nsaid to-day.\r\n\r\n  [193] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 449.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of perfect health might also be added to this list,\r\nsince only the most robust constitution can support the strain of\r\nlabours which were always arduous, and, with the rapid increase of\r\nbusiness and the prolongation of each succeeding session, grow\r\nannually more onerous.\r\n\r\nHour after hour does the Speaker sit in the splendid isolation of the\r\nChair, listening to interminable speeches, of which no small\r\nproportion are insupportably wearisome.\r\n\r\n    \"Like sad Prometheus, fastened to his rock,\r\n    In vain he looks for pity to the clock;\r\n    While, vulture-like, the dire [M.P.] appears,\r\n    And, far more savage, rends his suff'ring ears.\"[194]\r\n\r\n  [194] \"The Rolliad.\"\r\n\r\nHe may not rest, though the cooing of Ministers on the immemorial\r\nfront bench, and the murmur of innumerable M.P.'s, must often threaten\r\nto reduce the hapless listener to a condition bordering upon coma. He\r\nmust pay the strictest attention to every pearl that falls from the\r\nlips of \"honourable gentlemen,\" many of whom delight to air their\r\nvocabulary at an unconscionable length, and, like Dryden's Shadwell,\r\n\"never deviate into sense.\" He must be ever ready to check\r\nirrelevancy, to avert personalities, to guide some discursive speaker\r\nback to the point at issue; nor is he upheld by the stimulus of\r\ninterest which might possibly be his could he look forward to replying\r\nto the member who is addressing the House.\r\n\r\nFor the last hundred years it has been considered undignified for the\r\nSpeaker to take any personal part in debate, even when the House is in\r\nCommittee, though Speaker Denison once broke this rule, and made a\r\nlong speech upon some agricultural question. Speaker Abbot often spoke\r\nin Committee, and once actually moved an amendment to a Bill which had\r\nbeen read a second time, and succeeded in getting it thrown out. At a\r\nstill earlier date, in 1780, we read of Sir Fletcher Norton inveighing\r\nvehemently against the influence of the Crown, and making a violent\r\nattack upon Lord North which resulted in what Walpole calls \"a strange\r\nscene of Billingsgate between the Speaker and the Minister.\"[195] But\r\nthough Speaker Norton, who was reputed to be the worst-tempered man in\r\nthe House, could thus relieve his pent-up feelings in occasional\r\nbursts of eloquence, he took no pains to conceal his boredom, and\r\nduring the course of a particularly tedious debate would often cry\r\naloud, \"I am tired! I am weary! I am heartily sick of all this!\"[196]\r\nSpeaker Denison, even, on one occasion, at the end of a protracted\r\nsession, grew so anxious for release that when a tiresome orator rose\r\nto continue the debate he could not refrain from joining in the\r\nmembers' general chorus of \"Oh! oh!\"\r\n\r\n  [195] Horace Walpole's \"Letters,\" vol. vii. p. 340. (This Speaker's\r\n  criticism of the royal expenditure on a later occasion roused the\r\n  animosity of George III., and cost him the loss of the Chair.)\r\n\r\n  [196] May's \"Constitutional History,\" vol. i. p. 503 n.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, modern Speakers seem able to exercise complete\r\nself-control, and, bored though they must often be, are polite enough\r\nto hide the fact. They cannot now have recourse to that flowing bowl\r\nof porter which Speaker Cornwall kept by the side of the Chair, from\r\nwhich he drank whenever he felt the need of a mental fillip,\r\nsubsequently falling into a pleasing torpor which the babble of debate\r\ndid nothing to dispel. To-day, indeed, the Speaker neither slumbers\r\nnor sleeps, and the advice given by the poet Praed to the occupant of\r\nthe Chair during one of the debates of the first reformed Parliament\r\nwould fall on deaf ears.\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep, Mr. Speaker; it's surely fair,\r\n    If you don't in your bed, that you should in your chair;\r\n    Longer and longer still they grow,\r\n    Tory and Radical, Aye and No;\r\n    Talking by night, and talking by day;\r\n    Sleep, Mr. Speaker, sleep, sleep while you may!\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sweet to men\r\n    Is the sleep that comes but now and then;\r\n    Sweet to the sorrowful, sweet to the ill,\r\n    Sweet to the children who work in a mill.\r\n    You have more need of sleep than they;\r\n    Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may!\"\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary for the proper performance of his duties that a\r\nSpeaker should possess good eyesight, and a memory exceptionally\r\nretentive of names and faces. In 1640, when a heated dispute rose\r\nbetween members of the House, several of whom claimed precedence of\r\nspeech, a rule was made that whoever first \"caught the Speaker's eye\"\r\nshould have the right to address the House.[197] This rule still holds\r\ngood. Much confusion may therefore arise if the Speaker happens to\r\nsuffer from obliquity of vision. Sir John Trevor squinted abominably;\r\nconsequently two members would often catch his eye simultaneously, and\r\ndecline to give way to one another.[198] To obviate this, a further\r\nrule was framed to the effect that the Speaker should call by name\r\nupon the member privileged to address the House--a rule which must\r\noften prove a severe tax upon a Speaker's memory.\r\n\r\n  [197] \"People say, when you get on the blind side of a man, you get\r\n  into his favour; but it is quite the reverse with the members when\r\n  they get on the blind side of the Speaker.\" Pearson's \"Political\r\n  Dictionary,\" p. 53.\r\n\r\n  [198] When Trevor was Master of the Rolls, a post he combined with\r\n  that of Speaker, it was said that if Justice were blind, Equity was\r\n  now seen to squint!\r\n\r\nIn former days, when there was any doubt as to who should speak, the\r\nmatter was referred to the House, as is still the practice of the\r\nHouse of Lords. Nowadays it is settled by the Speaker. It is the usual\r\npractice of the Chair to fix an alternate eye upon either side of the\r\nHouse, and thus provide both parties with equal opportunities of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe tension of this perpetual strain upon a Speaker's nerves is not\r\naltogether relieved when he quits the Chair. As long as the House is\r\nsitting it is obligatory upon him to remain within the precincts of\r\nthe building, close at hand, lest the proceedings in Committee of the\r\nwhole House come to an end, and the House be resumed, or in case a\r\nsudden emergency should arise to demand his immediate presence. And\r\nwell it is that this should be so. Who that was present on that\r\npainful occasion in the summer of 1893, when for once the decencies of\r\ndebate were violated, and the House degenerated into a bear-garden,\r\ncan have forgotten the effect of Mr. Speaker Peel's sudden advent upon\r\nthe scene?\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain had drawn a comparison between Herod and Mr.\r\nGladstone. A Nationalist member retaliated by shouting \"Judas!\" at the\r\nmember for West Birmingham. In vain did a weak Chairman seek to\r\nrestore order, and when a Radical member crossed the floor and sat\r\ndown in the accustomed seat of the Leader of the Opposition, he was at\r\nonce pushed on to the floor by an indignant Unionist. This was the\r\nsignal for an impulsive group of Nationalists to detach itself from\r\nthe main body of the Irish party, and rush towards the front\r\nOpposition bench. In a moment the House was in an uproar. It is not\r\nknown who struck the first blow, but before many moments had elapsed\r\nthe floor of the Commons was the arena of a hand-to-hand struggle\r\nbetween hysterical politicians of all parties, while from the\r\nGovernment bench Mr. Gladstone watched this tumultuous scene with all\r\nthe bitter emotions of one to whom the honour of the House was\r\nespecially dear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Speaker had been sent for, and in an incredibly short\r\nspace of time appeared upon the scene. With his advent hostilities\r\nceased as suddenly as they had begun. The storm died away; passion\r\nquailed before \"the silent splendid anger of his eyes.\" In the breasts\r\nin which but a moment ago fury had been seething there was now room\r\nfor no feelings save those of shame.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Chair is no doubt enhanced by the distinctive\r\ndress which a modern Speaker wears. The flowing wig and full robes\r\nhave an important use. Mankind pays an involuntary homage to the pomp\r\nand circumstance of such attire. Perhaps it was because Lenthall\r\npossessed no peculiar costume to distinguish him from his fellows, but\r\nwore the short grey cloak and peaked hat of the Puritan, that he was\r\nsubjected to the humiliation of having \"Baugh!\" shouted in his\r\nastonished ear. Indeed, were a modern Speaker dressed \"in smart\r\nbuckskin breeches, with well-topped boots, a buff waistcoat and blue\r\nfrock-coat, with a rosebud stuck in the buttonhole,\" as a\r\nParliamentary writer of the last century suggested, \"he might roar to\r\nthe crack of his voice before he would be able to command order in a\r\ntempestuous debate.\"[199]\r\n\r\n  [199] Barnes's \"Political Portraits,\" p. 218.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four centuries of Parliament the Speaker received no\r\nregular salary adequate to his needs. In 1673, Sir Edward Seymour was\r\npaid £5 a day, and relied for the remainder of his income upon the\r\nfees on private bills which accompanied the office. Other Speakers in\r\nthe past were remunerated by the gift of Government appointments or\r\nsinecures conferred upon them by the Crown. This casual system was put\r\na stop to in 1790, when a fixed salary was first paid by the House to\r\nits chief officer.\r\n\r\nFor the next fifty years the Speaker could also claim valuable\r\nperquisites in the shape of equipment money, amounting to £1000, at\r\nthe commencement of each new Parliament, a service of plate (valued at\r\nabout the same sum), and a sessional allowance of £100 for stationery.\r\nHe was also permitted to carry the Chair away with him at the end of\r\nevery Parliament, and Speaker Onslow is said to have thus acquired\r\nfive of these bulky pieces of furniture, the disposal of which in his\r\nprivate residence must have afforded him a perplexing problem.[200]\r\n\r\n  [200] None of these chairs is to be found at Clandon, nor has the\r\n  Onslow family any record of their existence, so perhaps the story of\r\n  this particular perquisite is nothing but a legend and a myth.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker also received a gift of wine and a Christmas present of\r\nbroadcloth from the Clothworkers' Company; and, as a buck and doe were\r\nsent to him annually from the Royal Park at Windsor, had probably more\r\nopportunities of burying venison than any of his contemporaries. The\r\n£1000 equipment money is still provided, and a service of plate, while\r\nan adequate supply of stationery is substituted for the allowance.\r\n\r\nAs \"First Commoner\" the Speaker takes precedence of all others, and\r\namong his many honorary dignities is the Trusteeship of the British\r\nMuseum, to which all Speakers, since and including Arthur Onslow, have\r\nbeen appointed. His present salary amounts to £5000 a year, and he is\r\nalso provided with an official residence in the Palace of Westminster,\r\nexempt from the payment of all rates and taxes.\r\n\r\nOut of this income he is expected to entertain, and invitations to the\r\n\"Speaker's Dinners\" have come to be looked upon as one of the minor\r\ndelights of membership. During the eighteenth century the Speaker was\r\nin the habit of giving evening parties and official dinners on the\r\nSaturdays and Sundays of the session.[201] Speaker Abbot, in his\r\nDiary, describes one of these dinners at which twenty guests were\r\nentertained. \"The style of the dinner was soup at the top and bottom,\r\nchanged for fish, and afterwards changed for roast saddle of mutton\r\nand roast loin of veal.\" The wine was champagne, Hock, Hermitage, and\r\n(which sounds unpleasant) iced Burgundy.[202] His successors have\r\nalways continued the practice of holding regular weekly entertainments\r\nof a social character, at which the members attend in _levée_ dress,\r\nand it is doubtful whether any guest to-day would follow the example\r\nof Cobbett, who declined an invitation to dine with Speaker Manners\r\nSutton on the grounds that he was \"not accustomed to the society of\r\ngentlemen.\"[203]\r\n\r\n  [201] Pellew's \"Life of Sidmouth,\" vol. i. p. 368.\r\n\r\n  [202] \"Diary of Lord Colchester,\" February 2, 1796.\r\n\r\n  [203] Dalling's \"Historical Characters,\" vol. ii. p. 181.\r\n\r\nIn old days, as we have seen, the Speakership was often a\r\nstepping-stone to some higher appointment. Sir Thomas More, \"the first\r\nEnglish gentleman who signalized himself as an orator; the first\r\nwriter of prose (as Townsend calls him) which is still intelligible\"[204]--\r\nwhatever that may mean--was also the first lay Chancellor of England.\r\nIt was not considered strange for the Speaker to hold some ministerial\r\nappointment both while he sat in the Chair and after his retirement.\r\nSir Edward Coke was Solicitor-General as well as Speaker; Harley\r\noccupied the office of Secretary of State and the Chair\r\nsimultaneously. Spencer Compton was Paymaster-General as well as\r\nSpeaker, and, as Lord Wilmington, became Prime Minister in 1742. Nor\r\nwas he the only Speaker to exchange the Chair for the Premiership.\r\nAddington succeeded Pitt in that office in 1801; Grenville became\r\nPrime Minister in the Government of \"All the Talents,\" five years\r\nlater; and Manners Sutton is said to have been urged by the Duke of\r\nWellington to form a Ministry in 1831-2.[205]\r\n\r\n  [204] Townsend's \"History of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n  [205] \"Croker Papers,\" vol. ii. p. 164.\r\n\r\nNowadays, when a Speaker finally relinquishes the Chair, it would be\r\nconsidered derogatory to his dignity for him to reappear in the House\r\nas a simple member of Parliament. Addington did so, but soon realized\r\nthe difficulty of his position, and requested that he might be\r\nelevated to the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nIt has long been the custom for the Commons to ask the Crown to\r\nrecognize in a material fashion the services of a retiring Speaker. He\r\nis allowed a pension of £4000 a year, and, ever since the retirement\r\nof Abbot in 1817, a peerage of the rank of a viscountcy has been\r\nconferred upon him.\r\n\r\nPlaced in a position of extraordinary trust, hedged about with the\r\nlofty traditions of his office, weighed down by heavy responsibilities,\r\nengaged in a sedentary occupation during the greater part of the day\r\nor night, a Speaker may well agree with that candid correspondent who,\r\nin congratulating Addington on his elevation to the Chair in 1789,\r\nreferred to the Speakership as \"one of the most awful posts I\r\nknow.\"[206]\r\n\r\nIn the long list of those who have so ably guided and controlled the\r\nproceedings of the House of Commons during the last hundred years,\r\nmany names stand forth conspicuously--Manners Sutton, Shaw Lefevre,\r\nDenison, Brand, Peel. No Speaker has ever fallen short of the trust\r\nreposed in him, or failed in his duty to the House, and it may\r\nconfidently be asserted that so long as the standard of English\r\npolitical life maintains its present high level, no difficulty will\r\never be experienced in providing the Chair with an occupant who shall\r\nfill it, not only worthily, but with distinction.\r\n\r\n  [206] Pellew's \"Life of Sidmouth,\" vol. i. p. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament, like everything else, must have a beginning. The opening\r\nof a session which is also the commencement of a new Parliament is an\r\nevent which tradition invests with all the accompaniments of what\r\nCobden contemptuously referred to as \"barbaric pomp.\" The inaugural\r\nrites are performed with a stately ceremonial of which Selden himself\r\nwould have approved[207]; everything is done to make the pageant as\r\nimpressive as possible.\r\n\r\n  [207] \"Ceremony,\" says Selden, \"keeps up all things; 'tis like a penny\r\n  glass to a rich spirit, or some excellent water; without it the water\r\n  will be spilt, the spirit lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual business of the opening may be described as extending over\r\nseveral days, the climax being reached when the sovereign arrives in\r\nperson to deliver his speech.\r\n\r\nThe opening itself is nowadays performed by a Commission issued for\r\nthat purpose under the Great Seal. On the day appointed by royal\r\nproclamation for the meeting of a new Parliament, the Houses assemble\r\nin their respective chambers. Before doing so, however, special\r\nprecautions have been taken to ensure the safety of our legislators. A\r\npicturesque procession, composed of Yeomen of the Guard in their\r\nstriking uniforms, makes its way through the numerous subterranean\r\nvaults of the Palace of Westminster, seeking diligently for the\r\nhandiwork of some modern Guy Fawkes. This now familiar search is an\r\nancient custom kept up more in accordance with popular sentiment than\r\nfor any practical reason. The duties of the Beefeaters have no doubt\r\nalready been anticipated by the police, but though the fruitlessness\r\nof their quest is now a matter of regular recurrence, they\r\npersistently refuse to be discouraged, and the search is prosecuted\r\nwith renewed hopefulness at the commencement of every session.[208]\r\n\r\n  [208] They even carry lighted lanterns, though the whole place is\r\n  ablaze with electric light!\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon, the Lord Chancellor, preceded by the\r\nMace and Purse, and attended by his Train Bearer, enters the House of\r\nLords by the Bar. He is dressed in his robes, and when he has taken\r\nhis seat, places his cocked hat upon his head. Four other Lords\r\nCommissioners, similarly attired, are seated beside him on a bench\r\nsituated between the Woolsack and the Throne. From this point of\r\nvantage the Chancellor summons the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,\r\nand commands him to inform the Commons that their immediate attendance\r\nis desired in the House of Lords to hear the Commission read.\r\n\r\nThe post of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod dates from the reign of\r\nHenry VIII. By the constitution creating the Order of the Garter, he\r\nwas to be an officer \"whom the Sovereign and Companions will shall be\r\na gentleman famous in Arms and Blood, and live within the Dominions of\r\nthe Sovereign, and, for the dignity and honour of the Order, shall be\r\nchief of all Ushers of this Kingdom, and have the care and custody of\r\nthe doors of the High Court called Parliament.\" Black Rod, either\r\npersonally or through his deputy, the Yeoman Usher, fulfils in the\r\nHouse of Lords the functions which are performed in the Lower House by\r\nthe Sergeant-at-Arms of the Commons. As custodian of the doors of\r\nParliament, he once had the right to appoint all the doorkeepers and\r\nmessengers of the House of Lords, as well as his assistant, the Yeoman\r\nUsher. He used in old days to sell these appointments for large sums,\r\nand as his fees brought him in a substantial income--in 1875 they\r\namounted to £5300--and he was also provided with an official\r\nresidence, his post was one to be coveted. The system of paying\r\nofficials by fees was, however, abolished in 1877, and Black Rod's\r\nannual salary was fixed at £2000, which to-day has been reduced by\r\nhalf, while his residence has been taken from him and given to the\r\nClerk of the Parliaments.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the Lord Chancellor's command, Black Rod at once\r\nobeys--he is usually a retired naval or military officer and the\r\nspirit of discipline is still strong within him--and repairs to the\r\nLower House to deliver his message.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a busy scene is being enacted in the House of Commons. From\r\nthe earliest hours before the dawn members have been gradually\r\nassembling at Westminster. At the gates of Palace Yard a respectful\r\ncrowd collects to watch the arrival of the nation's lawmakers.\r\nMotor-cars, carriages, and the more humble public conveyances flow in\r\na ceaseless stream through the Commons' gates. The traffic at the\r\ncorner of Whitehall is perpetually held up to allow some member to\r\ncross the street in safety, much to the annoyance of travellers who\r\ndesire to catch a train at Waterloo Station. Smiling police constables\r\nsalute the old familiar faces, carefully scrutinizing the new ones for\r\nfuture reference.\r\n\r\nThe House within presents something of the appearance of a school on\r\nthe first day of a new term. The old boys welcome each other\r\neffusively, exchanging holiday reminiscences; the new boys wander\r\ntimidly about the precincts, seeking to increase their topographical\r\nknowledge. Friend greets friend with all the warmth engendered by\r\nseparation; colleagues describe their own, and inquire tenderly after\r\none another's ailments. Even the bitterest opponents may be seen\r\ncongratulating each other on re-election, or exchanging accounts of\r\ntheir individual experiences during the recess. An atmosphere of peace\r\nand goodwill pervades the whole House.\r\n\r\nAll is bustle and confusion in the Chamber itself, where members\r\nhasten to secure places on the green benches upon either side of the\r\nSpeaker's Chair. By the rules of the House no member has a right to\r\nreserve a seat unless he has been present within the precincts during\r\nprayers, and has staked out his claim either with a hat or a card\r\nprovided for the purpose. The hat used on this occasion must be a\r\nmember's own \"real working hat.\" He may not arrive with two hats, one\r\nto wear and the other to employ as a seat-preserver; nor is he\r\npermitted to borrow the headgear of a friend who has already secured a\r\nseat. A story is told of some wily member appearing at Westminster, on\r\nthe morning of an important debate, in a four-wheeler brimming over\r\nwith hats which he proposed to distribute upon the benches in order to\r\nretain places for his party. Such conduct, however, though ingenious,\r\nis strictly contrary to regulations, and could scarcely hope to escape\r\nthe vigilant eye of the Sergeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TREASURY BENCH IN 1863\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING AFTER THE PAINTING BY J. PHILIP]\r\n\r\nCertain privileges are accorded to members who by reason of their\r\ndistinguished position, or long service in the House, have acquired a\r\nclaim to particular seats. The two front benches on either side have\r\nlong been reserved for the more prominent politicians. On the right of\r\nthe Chair is the Treasury Bench, where Ministers sit; while the front\r\nseat facing them is occupied by the leading members of the Opposition.\r\nIt has been customary for Privy Councillors to sit on these two\r\nbenches, and at the opening of Parliament the members for the City of\r\nLondon may claim a similar privilege.\r\n\r\nThe right of Cabinet Ministers to occupy front seats, now undisputed,\r\nwas sometimes questioned in olden days. In 1601, as the outcome of\r\ncomplaints on this subject, Robert Cecil, then Secretary of State,\r\noffered to give up his place most willingly to any member who wished\r\nto sit near the Chair. \"We that sit here,\" he said, \"take your favours\r\nout of courtesy, not out of right.\"[209] Courtesy, has, indeed,\r\ngenerally been displayed by members on this particular question,\r\nthough there have been occasional exceptions. That rough diamond,\r\nCobbett, who was frequently complaining of the lack of space in the\r\nHouse, occupied Sir Robert Peel's accustomed seat one day, as a\r\nprotest against the insufficient accommodation of the Chamber. No\r\nnotice, however, was taken of his conduct, and his rude but\r\nlegitimate methods have never since been emulated.\r\n\r\n  [209] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 630.\r\n\r\nA member who has been honoured by a parliamentary vote of thanks, or\r\nhas grown grey in the service of the House, is usually allowed to\r\nretain his seat.[210] Hume, who attended every single debate during\r\nthe period of his membership, for years occupied the same bench close\r\nto one of the pillars supporting the gallery above the Speaker's\r\nChair. \"There is Joseph,\" remarked a wag who was not above making a\r\npun, \"always at his _post_!\"[211]\r\n\r\n  [210] Sir George de Lacy Evans (1787-1870) was the last member\r\n  honoured by being allowed to retain the seat in which he had received\r\n  his vote of thanks.\r\n\r\n  [211] Grant's \"Random Recollections,\" p. 7.\r\n\r\nOtherwise members may sit wherever they please, provided they have\r\nqualified by presence at prayers. Certain positions in the House have,\r\nhowever, come to be regarded as symbolical of the political views of\r\ntheir occupants. Supporters of the Government sit on the right and\r\nthose of the Opposition on the left of the chair. The aisle or passage\r\nthat divides the House transversely has always acted as a sort of\r\npolitical boundary, and members who are independent of either party\r\nproclaim their freedom by sitting \"below the gangway.\" Here on the\r\nOpposition side the Irish party has sat for many years; here, too, the\r\nLabour members mostly congregate.\r\n\r\nOn the opening day the Speaker's Chair is, of course, vacant, and the\r\nmace reposes peacefully underneath the table. The duties of Chairman\r\nare undertaken by the Clerk of the House, who sits in his usual place,\r\nand presides in dumb show over the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe clerkship of the House of Commons is an important post, and has\r\nbeen in the hands of many capable and distinguished men. Among the\r\nfamous lawyers who have held this office may be instanced\r\nElsynge--ridiculed in Hudibras as \"Cler: Parl: Don: Com:\"[212]--Hatsell,\r\nErskine May, and Palgrave, all of whom have made valuable literary\r\ncontributions to the annals of parliamentary history.\r\n\r\n  [212] \"Hudibras,\" vol. i. p. 120. During the first years of the Long\r\n  Parliament Elsynge brought so much distinction to the position that\r\n  his authority was said to be greater than that of the Speaker\r\n  (Lenthall). His abilities, \"especially in taking and expressing the\r\n  sense of the House,\" became so conspicuous that \"more reverence was\r\n  paid to his stool than to the Speaker's chair.\"--Wood's \"Athenæ\r\n  Oxonienses,\" vol. iii. p. 363.\r\n\r\nThe post has also been temporarily filled by persons of considerably\r\nless eminence. In 1601, for example, Fulk Onslow, who was then clerk,\r\nwas permitted to appoint his servant, one Cadwallader Tydder, to act\r\nas his deputy. Again, in 1620, the clerk being incapacitated by\r\nillness, his son was allowed to take his place, and it was advised\r\nthat a lawyer should sit beside him \"with a hat upon his head\" to\r\nassist the youth in his unaccustomed _rôle_.[213] It is the Clerk's\r\nduty to record the proceedings, edit the Journals, and sign any orders\r\nissued by the House. Up to the year 1649, when he was given an annual\r\nsalary of £500, his income consisted of £10 a year (paid half-yearly!)\r\nand certain fees on private bills. A collection, amounting to about\r\n£25,[214] to which all members were expected to contribute sums\r\nvarying from 5_s._ to £1, was also made for him at the close of the\r\nsession. This sounds a paltry sum, but Hatsell is said to have made\r\n£10,000 a year while Clerk of the House, among his other perquisites\r\nbeing a _douceur_ of £300, which the Clerk Assistant paid to his chief\r\nfor the privilege of appointment. In those days the Clerk could also\r\nearn small sums by copying Bills or making extracts from the Journals\r\nof the House for members, who paid him at the rate of ten lines a\r\npenny, though if they declared upon oath that they were unable to pay\r\nthis sum, no charge was made for the work.[215]\r\n\r\n  [213] Hatsell's \"Precedents,\" vol. ii. p. 251 n.\r\n\r\n  [214] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 688.\r\n\r\n  [215] \"Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,\" p. 46.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the messenger from the House of Lords is heralded in\r\nthe lobbies by loud cries of \"Black Rod!\" The door of the House of\r\nCommons is flung open, and the Gentleman Usher, in full uniform and\r\ndecorations, and bearing the wand of his office in his hand, advances\r\nin a stately fashion up the floor of the House and delivers his\r\nmessage. He then retires backwards as gracefully as possible until he\r\nreaches the Bar, where he awaits the arrival of the Clerk. The two now\r\nwalk together, attended by as many members as care to accompany them,\r\nto the Bar of the House of Lords, where the Lords Commissioners are\r\nawaiting their advent.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Commons' contingent appears, the Lord Chancellor orders\r\nthe reading of the Letters Patent constituting the Commission for the\r\nopening of Parliament, and when this task has been performed by the\r\nReading Clerk of the House of Lords, desires the faithful Commons to\r\nretire and choose a Speaker. With this purpose in view the members\r\nreturn forthwith to the Lower House.\r\n\r\nThe election of a Speaker is the most important part of the day's\r\nbusiness, for without it the House of Commons cannot be constituted,\r\nnor can members be permitted to take the oath.\r\n\r\nTheoretically a Speaker leaves the Chair with the Parliament that\r\nelected him. Practically, nowadays, he is retained in office. He is\r\nreappointed with the usual ceremonies at the beginning of every\r\nParliament, and it is rare for an incoming Ministry to supplant the\r\noccupant of the Chair, even though he may have been the nominee of\r\npolitical opponents. Manners Sutton was six times Speaker, Arthur\r\nOnslow five times, while Shaw Lefevre, Denison, and Peel each occupied\r\nthe Chair in four successive Parliaments. Since their day an unwise\r\nand abortive attempt was made to replace Speaker Gully by a\r\nConservative nominee in 1895, but it is unlikely that such an incident\r\nwill recur.\r\n\r\nThe motion for a Speaker's election is made by a member on the\r\nGovernment side of the House, and usually seconded by a member of the\r\nOpposition, both being called upon to speak by the Clerk who silently\r\npoints his finger at each in turn. If it is intended to contest the\r\nelection, the two candidates put forward are proposed and seconded\r\nseparately by members of their own party. The question that the\r\nGovernment candidate \"do take the Chair of this House as Speaker\" is\r\nfirst put by the Clerk, and divided upon in the ordinary way. If a\r\nmajority of the House is in favour of the election of this candidate,\r\nno further division is necessary. If not, the same proceeding is\r\ncarried out with regard to the second candidate. In such cases it has\r\nbeen the custom for each nominee to vote for his opponent. The\r\ndivision is naturally one of intense interest. Perhaps the most\r\nexciting elections of a Speaker that have ever occurred were those\r\nthat took place in 1835 and 1895. On the first occasion Abercrombie\r\nwas elected to replace Manners Sutton, by the narrow margin of\r\nten,[216] and in 1895 Speaker Gully's majority only exceeded this by a\r\nsingle vote.\r\n\r\n  [216] Torrens' \"Life of Graham,\" vol. ii. p. 30.\r\n\r\n\"When it appeareth who is chosen,\" says Elsynge, \"after a good pause\r\nhe standeth up, and showeth what abilities are required in the\r\nSpeaker, and that there are divers amongst them well furnished with\r\nsuch qualities, etc., disableth himself and prayeth a new choice to be\r\nmade. After which two go unto him in the place where he sits and take\r\nhim by the arms, and lead him to the chair.\"[217] In old days it was\r\ncustomary for the Speaker-Elect to \"disable\" himself at great length\r\nand in the humblest possible terms. Christopher Wray, in 1570, spoke\r\nfor two hours in this self-deprecatory style. Sergeant Yelverton,\r\ntwenty-six years later, explained his unfitness for the post in a\r\nlengthy harangue in which he remarked that if \"Demosthenes, being so\r\nlearned and eloquent as he was, one whom none surpassed, trembled to\r\nspeak before Phocion at Athens, how much more shall I, being unlearned\r\nand unskilful, supply this place of dignity, charge, and trouble to\r\nspeak before so many Phocions as here be?\"[218] Other Speakers put\r\nforward \"a sudden disease,\" \"extreme youth,\" or some similar\r\ndisability as their excuse for escaping from the service of the Chair.\r\nEven as late as the beginning of the eighteenth century Sir Spencer\r\nCompton thought it necessary to declare to the Commons that he had\r\n\"neither the memory to retain, the judgment to collect, nor the skill\r\nto guide their debates.\"[219]\r\n\r\n  [217] Elsynge's \"Parliaments of England,\" pp. 160 and 161.\r\n\r\n  [218] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 549.\r\n\r\n  [219] Townsend's \"History of the House of Commons\", vol. i. p. 228.\r\n\r\nThis excessive humility on the part of a Speaker-Elect has now\r\ndisappeared, together with the ridiculous old custom whereby it was\r\nconsidered correct for him to evince actual physical reluctance to\r\ntake the Chair. It was once deemed proper for the newly elected\r\nSpeaker to refuse to occupy the exalted throne that awaited him until\r\nhis two supporters had seized him by the arms and dragged him like\r\nsome unwilling victim to the scaffold. To-day, he \"goes quietly,\" as\r\nthe police say; the proposer and seconder lead him gently by the hand,\r\nand he gives his attendants no trouble at all.\r\n\r\nAfter the Speaker has taken the Chair, the mace is laid upon the table\r\nbefore him, the leaders of either Party offer their congratulations,\r\nand the business of the day is over.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament meets once more, on the following afternoon, the\r\nChancellor and his four fellow Lords Commissioners, attired as before,\r\nin their robes, resume their seats upon the bench in the House of\r\nLords, and Black Rod is again commanded to summon the Commons. This\r\ntime his task is not so simple. When the messenger from the Lords\r\narrives at the door of the House of Commons, he finds it barred\r\nagainst him, nor is it opened until he has knocked thrice upon it and\r\ncraved permission to enter. This custom of refusing instant admittance\r\nto the Lords' official dates from those early times when messages from\r\nthe Crown were regarded by the jealous Commons with feelings bordering\r\non abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker-Elect, clad in his official dress, but without his robe,\r\nand wearing upon his head a small bob-wig in place of that luxuriant\r\nfull-bottomed affair which he is so soon to don, has already taken his\r\nseat in the Chair, making three profound obeisances to that article of\r\nfurniture as he advances towards it.\r\n\r\nWhen Black Rod has delivered his message, the Speaker-Elect,\r\nsurrounded by his official retinue, proceeds at once to the House of\r\nLords. Here he is politely received by the Lords Commissioners, who\r\nraise their hats three times in acknowledgment of his three\r\nobeisances. After acquainting the Lords Commissioners of his recent\r\nelection, he humbly submits himself to the royal approbation. The Lord\r\nChancellor thereupon expresses His Majesty's approval of the Commons'\r\nchoice, and the election of the Speaker is confirmed. In former days\r\nthe sovereign was in the habit of undertaking this duty in person. On\r\nJanuary 27, 1562, Queen Elizabeth came to Westminster in her state\r\nbarge, \"apparelled in her mantles open furred with ermine and in her\r\nKyrtle of crimson velvet closed before, and close sleeves, but the\r\nhands turned up with ermine. A hood hanging loose round about her neck\r\nof ermine. Over all a rich collar set with stones and other jewels,\r\nand on her head a rich call.\"[220] Thus attired, she proceeded to give\r\nthe royal assent to the election of the Speaker. This nowadays is a\r\nmere formality--it has indeed only once been refused, in 1678, when\r\nCharles II. declined to sanction the election of Sir Edward\r\nSeymour--and is given by the Lords Commissioners on the sovereign's\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n  [220] \"The Order for Proceeding to the Parliament\" (from the MS. at\r\n  the College of Arms).\r\n\r\nIn the days when the sovereign was in the habit of being present in\r\nthe House of Lords to ratify the choice of Speaker, the latter would\r\noften excuse himself to his monarch in terms even more abject than he\r\nhad used in the Lower House. Before the election of Sir Richard\r\nWaldegrave, in 1381, Speakers did not excuse themselves at all, and\r\nuntil Henry VIII.'s time they do not seem to have done so as a matter\r\nof etiquette, but merely from personal motives, wishing to ingratiate\r\nthemselves with the sovereign in whose pay they were and to whom they\r\nlooked for advancement. But towards the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury they began regularly to address the king in a fulsome\r\nfashion.[221] In 1537, for instance, we find Speaker Rich grovelling\r\nin abject prostration at the royal feet, and comparing the King to\r\nSolomon, Samson, Absalom, and most of the other heroes of Old\r\nTestament history. Even among the Speakers of that day, however, there\r\nwere men who refused to demean themselves to this form of flattery,\r\nand Queen Elizabeth was once forced to listen patiently while Richard\r\nOnslow, who declared himself to be \"a plain speaker, fit for the plain\r\nmatter, and to use plain words,\" delivered to Her Majesty an\r\n\"excellent oration,\" which lasted for two solid hours.[222]\r\n\r\n  [221] For a particularly servile speech of this kind see \"The\r\n  Sovereign's Prerogative,\" p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [222] \"Observations, Rules and Orders collected out of Divers Journals\r\n  of the House of Commons,\" p. 25.\r\n\r\nThis practice is fortunately extinct, but one other custom of Henry\r\nVIII.'s time still obtains. To-day the Speaker, on receipt of the\r\nroyal approbation, takes the opportunity of at once demanding the\r\n\"ancient and undoubted rights and privileges of the Commons\"--freedom\r\nfrom arrest, liberty of speech, access to the royal person, and that a\r\nfavourable construction be put upon their proceedings--and on his own\r\nbehalf begs that whatever error may occur in the discharge of his\r\nduties shall be imputed to him alone, and not to His Majesty's\r\nfaithful Commons.\r\n\r\nThese ancient rights and privileges having been confirmed by the King,\r\nthrough his Lords Commissioners and by the mouth of his Lord\r\nChancellor, the Speaker withdraws to the Lower House. There he\r\nacquaints the Commons of the result of his recent pilgrimage, and\r\ngratefully assures them once more of his complete devotion to their\r\nservice. After retiring for a few moments to make the necessary\r\nalterations in his costume, he returns, clad in his robe and wearing\r\nhis full-bottomed wig, and is now a complete and perfect Speaker.\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, the Upper House has temporarily adjourned to\r\nunrobe, and afterwards resumes to enable the Lords to continue taking\r\nthe Oath, which is meanwhile being administered to the Commons.\r\n\r\nPrior to the sixteenth century, members of Parliament were not\r\nrequired to swear; the Lords did not do so until 1678. But the Act of\r\nSupremacy of 1563 made it necessary for all members of the Commons to\r\ntake the oath, and in 1610 were introduced further oaths of Allegiance\r\nand Abjuration which were maintained until 1829. The old oaths aimed\r\nat excluding Roman Catholics from Parliament, and the regulation which\r\nin 1614 ordered every member to take the sacrament in St. Margaret's\r\nChurch on the Opening Day was but another means of ensuring the\r\nreligious loyalty of the Commons.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Lower House cannot take the oath until their Speaker\r\nhas been approved and sworn; the Lords may do so as soon as Parliament\r\nopens. In the Upper House the oath may be taken at any convenient time\r\nwhen the House is sitting; in the House of Commons likewise it may be\r\ntaken whenever a full House is sitting at any hour before business has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor leads the way in the House of Lords. When he has\r\npresented his writ of summons, repeated the formal words of the Oath\r\nof Allegiance after the Clerk, kissed the New Testament, and\r\nsubscribed to the Test Roll, he resumes his seat on the Woolsack. The\r\npeers then succeed one another in rapid rotation at the table, handing\r\ntheir writs of summons to the Clerk, and following the Chancellor's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn the Commons the Speaker first takes the oath in a very similar\r\nfashion, and writes his name in the Roll of Members. After this\r\nceremony is accomplished, members come up to the table in batches of\r\nfive, and are sworn simultaneously. They then shake hands with the\r\nSpeaker, and can now consider themselves full-fledged members of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of the last century three oaths had to be taken by\r\nevery member of either House: the oaths of Allegiance, of Supremacy,\r\nand Abjuration. There was further a declaration against\r\ntransubstantiation which effectually excluded Roman Catholics. But in\r\n1829 these last received relief, though the final words of the Oath of\r\nAbjuration still kept out the Jews.[223] In 1849 Baron Lionel de\r\nRothschild was excluded from the Commons because of his failure to\r\nswear on \"the true faith of a Christian.\" He accepted the Chiltern\r\nHundreds, but was again returned to Parliament by the City of London.\r\nAnd though he once more failed to obtain permission to vote in the\r\nHouse, he was allowed to sit there until 1857.[224] Six years before\r\nthis latter date another Jew, Alderman Salomons, insisted upon taking\r\nhis seat and voting in a division. He was forcibly ejected by the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, and subsequently fined £500 in the Exchequer Court\r\nas a penalty for voting without having previously taken the oath. In\r\n1858 an Act was passed substituting a single oath for the former\r\nthree, and giving both Houses power to deal with the Jewish difficulty\r\nby resolution, but it was not until 1866 that the words referring to\r\nChristianity were finally omitted from the oath.\r\n\r\n  [223] A peer in support contended that otherwise a Jew might become\r\n  Lord Chancellor. \"Why not?\" asked Lord Lyndhurst, in an undertone.\r\n  \"Daniel would have made a very good one!\" (Atlay's \"Victorian\r\n  Chancellors,\" vol. i. p. 61.)\r\n\r\n  [224] Failure to take the oath only prevents a member from sitting\r\n  within the Bar, voting in divisions, and taking part in debate. It\r\n  does not disqualify him from the other privileges of membership, nor\r\n  does it render his seat vacant.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of Quakers and atheists to take the oath disturbed for\r\nmany years the peace of mind of Parliament, and was the subject of\r\nfrequent legislation. In 1832 the Quaker Pease was elected for a\r\nDurham division, and claimed the right of affirming instead of taking\r\nthe oath. A Committee was appointed to consider the validity of such\r\nan affirmation, and came to the conclusion that this form might be\r\nsubstituted harmlessly for the more usual oath.\r\n\r\nThe case of the atheist Bradlaugh, which lasted for nearly ten years,\r\nwas a much more complicated affair, and presented endless difficulties\r\nto the parliamentary mind.\r\n\r\nWe have grown more broad-minded during the last fifty years, and the\r\nstory of Bradlaugh's persecution sounds incredible to modern ears.\r\nThis unfortunate man was hounded and harassed with a degree of\r\nintolerance which was almost mediæval in its ferocity. Politicians of\r\nevery grade combined to insult and bait him; he became the butt of\r\nParliament, and evoked from men who had hitherto shown but little zeal\r\nin their faith a religious ardour of the most fanatical and bigoted\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBradlaugh was returned to Parliament as member for Northampton in\r\n1880. As an atheist it was against his principles to swear upon the\r\nBible. When, therefore, he presented himself in the House of Commons\r\nwith the intention of taking his seat, he asked to be allowed to\r\naffirm instead of taking the oath. The fact of his being entirely\r\ndevoid of any religious beliefs or scruples rendered an affirmation in\r\nthe form usual in Parliament practically valueless. His request was\r\naccordingly refused, and when he declined to withdraw from the House,\r\nhe was committed to the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nMany members of the House of Commons were determined to prevent such a\r\nman from taking his seat, and for a long time its doors remained\r\nclosed against him. Lord Randolph Churchill made a violent attack upon\r\nhim on the 24th of May, in the course of which he read an extract from\r\nBradlaugh's book, \"The Impeachment of the House of Brunswick,\" hurling\r\nthe offensive volume on the floor and trampling it underfoot. The\r\nHouse of Commons has always disliked anything that borders upon\r\nmelodrama, and this action, more suited to the boards of the Adelphi\r\nthan to the stage of Parliament, fell as flat as Burke's famous\r\ndagger.[225] But the spirit that prompted it was the popular one, and\r\nit long seemed impossible for an atheist to sit in the House.\r\n\r\n  [225] In 1792 a sample dagger was sent from France to a Birmingham\r\n  firm, who were asked to make 3000 more of similar pattern. They\r\n  thought the order suspicious, and consulted the Secretary of State.\r\n  Burke happened to call at the latter's office, saw the dagger there,\r\n  and borrowed it. During the Second Reading of the Aliens Bill he\r\n  hurled this weapon on to the floor of the House, exclaiming, \"Let us\r\n  keep French principles from our heads, and French daggers from our\r\n  hearts!\" The Commons were not impressed, and only laughed, while\r\n  Sheridan whispered to a neighbour, \"The gentleman has brought us the\r\n  knife, but where is the fork?\" Another attempt at dramatic effect,\r\n  equally unsuccessful, occurred on the second reading of the Reform\r\n  Bill in 1831. Lord Brougham spoke for four hours, fortified by\r\n  frequent draughts of mulled port. At the end he exclaimed, \"By all the\r\n  ties that bind every one of us to our common order and our common\r\n  country, I solemnly adjure you--yea, on my bended knees, I supplicate\r\n  you--reject not this Bill!\" With these words he fell upon his knees,\r\n  and remained in this attitude so long that his friends, fearing that\r\n  he was suffering as much from mulled port as emotion, picked him up\r\n  and replaced him on the Woolsack.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, Gladstone moved a resolution allowing members who could not\r\nconscientiously take the oath to affirm, subject to any legal\r\nliabilities they might incur, and on the following day Bradlaugh made\r\nthe necessary affirmation. The affair did not end here, however. The\r\nlegal authorities had been stirred up to investigate the judicial\r\naspect of the case, and decided that a man of Bradlaugh's opinions was\r\nby law disqualified from affirming. He thus lost his seat, but was\r\npromptly re-elected. Whereupon the House of Commons carried a\r\nresolution that he be not permitted to go through the form of\r\nrepeating the words of the Oath, which, as far as Bradlaugh was\r\nconcerned, was an absolutely meaningless formality, and, in the\r\nopinion of many, an act of sheer blasphemy.[226]\r\n\r\n  [226] Bradlaugh is not the only politician who has failed to interpret\r\n  the words of the Oath in too literal a sense. Walpole became possessed\r\n  of some treasonable letters written by William Shippen, a Jacobite and\r\n  violent opponent of his. Walpole sent for Shippen, and burnt the\r\n  incriminating papers in his presence. Later on, when Shippen was\r\n  taking the oath of allegiance in the Commons, Walpole, who stood near\r\n  and knew the other's principles to be as treasonable as ever, smiled.\r\n  \"Egad! Robin,\" said Shippen, \"that's hardly fair!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Bradlaugh next attempted to take his seat, a further resolution\r\nwas carried excluding him altogether from the House. He refused,\r\nhowever, to acquiesce in this view of the situation, and, after giving\r\ndue notice of his intention to the Speaker, forced his way into the\r\nHouse, whence he was removed with some difficulty by the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms and police.\r\n\r\nFor a short time he remained quiet, and then suddenly, in 1882, he\r\nreappeared in the House of Commons, walked alone to the Table,\r\nadministered the oath to himself, and claimed the right to sit. Upon a\r\nmotion of Sir Stafford Northcote he was once more expelled, and once\r\nmore the electors of Northampton returned him as their representative.\r\n\r\nDuring the two following years Bradlaugh brought actions against the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms and his deputy, and tried to induce a court of law to\r\nrestrain these officials from carrying out the orders of the House.\r\nHis efforts, however, were vain, the courts deciding that the Commons\r\nhad a perfect right to control their own internal affairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 he again entered the House and took the oath. He was again\r\nexcluded from the precincts, applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, and\r\nwas again returned for Northampton.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had voted in several divisions, and the Attorney-General,\r\non behalf of the Crown, brought an action against him to recover three\r\nseparate sums of £500, as penalties for having voted without\r\npreviously taking the oath.\r\n\r\nFor two more years the conflict continued to rage round the burly\r\nfigure of this remarkable man. By 1886, however, the Commons had grown\r\nweary of this ceaseless and senseless persecution, and Bradlaugh was\r\nat last permitted to take his seat; and in 1888 an Act was passed\r\nextending the right to affirm to those who state that they have no\r\nreligious belief.\r\n\r\nParliament thus gradually came to take a broader view of the\r\nsituation, and during Bradlaugh's absence, in 1891, the House of\r\nCommons passed a resolution expunging from the Journals the original\r\nmotion whereby he was prevented from affirming. Thus ended a long\r\ncontroversy, in the course of which the much-harassed victim had\r\nbehaved with exemplary self-control, only once showing signs of\r\nannoyance, when the rough handling to which he was subjected by the\r\npolice resulted in the breakage of a favourite stylographic pen.\r\n\r\nThis taking of the oath or making an affirmation at the commencement\r\nof a new Parliament is the only introduction necessary for a member\r\nwho has been elected during the recess, or of a peer who has succeeded\r\nto a title.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a newly created peer, or of one who has been\r\nelevated to higher rank, is a ceremony that strikes the spectator as\r\nquaint or impressive, according as he has or has not a sense of\r\nhumour. Attired in his robes, and supported by two other peers of his\r\nown degree, who act as his sponsors, the new peer walks slowly up the\r\nfloor of the House of Lords, preceded by a procession of State\r\nofficers--Black Rod, Garter King-at-Arms, the Hereditary Earl Marshal\r\nof England, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, in full dress.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Woolsack the neophyte falls upon one knee and presents\r\nto the Lord Chancellor, and receives back from him, his patent of\r\npeerage and his writ of summons, both of which are read aloud by the\r\nReading Clerk. The new peer then takes the oath and signs the roll,\r\nand is led by his supporters and the officers of State on a ceremonial\r\npilgrimage round the Chamber to the bench on which he is by rank\r\nentitled to sit. Here the three peers in their scarlet robes seat\r\nthemselves. They are, however, only allowed a few moments' rest, and\r\nat a pre-concerted signal the trio rise together and lift their hats\r\nin unison to the Chancellor, who responds in similar fashion. Three\r\ntimes this gesture is repeated, after which the original procession is\r\nreformed, and the new peer retires, shaking hands with the Chancellor\r\non his way.\r\n\r\nMuch the same procedure is followed in the case of bishops, though\r\nspiritual peers are not preceded by the Great Officers, nor have they\r\nany patent to present. Representative peers of Scotland or Ireland are\r\nnot introduced in this formal manner, but merely take the oath and\r\nsign the roll.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a member of the House of Commons, elected in the\r\ncourse of the session, is a somewhat similar but less formal affair.\r\nAccompanied by two other members of Parliament he advances up the\r\nfloor of the House, \"making his obeisances as he goes up, that he may\r\nbe better known to the House,\" and frequently evoking cheers from the\r\nparty to which he belongs.[227] He may take the oath at any time, if\r\nthe Clerk of the House has received the certificate of his return. In\r\n1875 Dr. Kenealy, whose methods of conducting the defence of the\r\nnotorious Tichborne claimant had alienated the respect of most\r\nright-thinking men, was unable to persuade any member to introduce him\r\nin the House of Commons. At last, out of sheer kindness of heart, John\r\nBright declared that he would accompany the unpopular member. He was\r\nnot called upon to do so, however, the rule being in this instance\r\ndispensed with, at Disraeli's suggestion, and Kenealy walked alone to\r\nthe Table.\r\n\r\n  [227] Hatsell adds that it was contrary to custom for members so\r\n  introduced to appear in top-boots. Hatsell's \"Precedents,\" vol. ii. p.\r\n  85.\r\n\r\nThe swearing in of peers and members occupies several days, and by the\r\ntime this task is accomplished Parliament is ready to listen to the\r\nKing's Speech, with which every new session is opened.\r\n\r\nThis final ceremony is a State function of the most picturesque and\r\nspectacular description. The road leading from Buckingham Palace to\r\nWestminster is lined with troops; flags fly from all the public\r\nbuildings; the pavements and windows along the route are packed with\r\nsightseers. In the famous glass coach, drawn by the fat cream ponies\r\nso dear to the heart of every loyal subject, the King and Queen drive\r\nin State to the House of Lords. Here they are met by the Lord\r\nChancellor, Purse in hand, while the Great Officers of State form a\r\nlong procession through the Royal Gallery, and precede their Majesties\r\ninto the Gilded Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe House presents a magnificent spectacle. Every bench is crowded\r\nwith peers in their scarlet and ermine robes. At their sides sit the\r\npeeresses in evening dress, adorned, according to custom, with\r\nfeathers and veils, while the Woolsacks in the centre of the House are\r\noccupied by the Judges arrayed in their judicial finery, and in a box\r\nat one side are the Ambassadors and Ministers of Foreign Powers.[228]\r\nThe galleries are filled with specially privileged visitors of both\r\nsexes, and, as the royal procession enters, the whole assembly rises\r\nto its feet and remains standing until their Majesties have reached\r\nthe two thrones at one end of the Chamber.\r\n\r\n  [228] Peeresses cannot claim the right to be present, but are allowed\r\n  to attend in accordance with a privilege of long standing, which adds\r\n  much to the beauty of the ceremony. Judges have always enjoyed the\r\n  right of attendance. In old days they took a prominent part in the\r\n  public business of the House, but were not regular members, and,\r\n  though they gave their legal opinions upon constitutional questions\r\n  before Parliament, could neither vote nor join in debate.\r\n\r\nOn taking his place upon the throne, the King bids the peers to be\r\nseated, and, through the Lord Great Chamberlain, commands Black Rod to\r\ninform the Commons that it is His Majesty's pleasure that they attend\r\nhim immediately in the House of Lords.[229]\r\n\r\n  [229] If Parliament is opened by Commission, Black Rod is sent to\r\n  _desire_ (not to _command_) the attendance of the Commons, and the\r\n  King's Speech is read by the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of this royal message to the Commons is the signal for a\r\nstampede of members towards the Upper House; grave politicians vieing\r\nwith one another in the endeavour to be first at the Bar of the Lords.\r\nO'Connell compared the rush of members on such occasions to that of a\r\npack of boys released from school, scrimmaging together to get out of\r\nthe class-room. In their haste to arrive at the goal, the Commons are\r\napt to hurry the unhappy Speaker before them like the sacrificial ox,\r\nurged along reluctant to the horns of the altar.[230] The rude\r\nincursion of the Commons once provoked the Yeoman of the Guard, who\r\nkept the doors of the Lords, to shut it in their faces. \"Goodmen\r\nburgesses,\" said the Sergeant of the Guard, in 1604, \"ye come not\r\nhere!\" much to the Commons' indignation.[231] Members have often had\r\ntheir clothes torn in the confusion and tumult of this rush, and one\r\nat least has suffered a dislocated shoulder. Sir Augustus Clifford,\r\nwho was Black Rod in 1832, lost his hat and was physically injured in\r\na _melée_ on the opening day. In 1901, the first opening of Parliament\r\nby the sovereign in a new reign, after a long discontinuance of the\r\nceremony, and the number of new members after a general election,\r\ncombined to make the occasion exceptional. In spite of the employment\r\nof eighty extra police, engaged to keep the way clear for the\r\nSpeaker's procession, several persons were badly hurt, owing to the\r\noverpowering rush of members struggling to secure the limited number\r\nof places available below the Bar of the Lords, and many policemen\r\nlost their helmets in the struggle.[232]\r\n\r\n  [230] O'Connell's \"Experiences,\" vol. i. p. 9.\r\n\r\n  [231] Hatsell says that such expressions were \"very opprobrious,\" and\r\n  might not unfitly have been applied \"to the Peasants of France or the\r\n  Boores of Germany.\" \"Precedents,\" vol. i. p. 237.\r\n\r\n  [232] In 1860 such occurrences were prevented by the seats being\r\n  balloted for by the Commons. \"The faithful Commons being elected by\r\n  ballot,\" as we read in \"The Times\" of January 25, \"not now as formerly\r\n  rushing in like the gods in the gallery on Boxing Night; on the\r\n  contrary, they came steadily up to the Bar, the Speaker leading, and\r\n  on his right Lord Palmerston.\" Today the system of balloting is again\r\n  employed, and a much larger space both on the ground and in the\r\n  galleries is allotted to the Commons.\r\n\r\nHeaded by their Speaker, then, the Commons surge into the Upper\r\nChamber, and stand at the Bar, awaiting the reading of the King's\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the Commons to gain good places from which to listen to\r\nthe Speech is all the greater nowadays, since it has ceased to be\r\ncustomary to publish it beforehand. In Walpole's time the Government\r\nused to meet at the Cockpit in Whitehall on the eve of the opening to\r\nconsider the royal speech.[233] This practice came to an end with the\r\neighteenth century, but the Speech was still made public property by\r\nbeing sent to the papers on the evening of the Ministerial and\r\nOpposition dinners which precede the opening of Parliament. It is\r\nstill read aloud by the official hosts at these banquets, but does not\r\nappear in the Press on the following morning, and the contents of the\r\nSpeech are not made public until it is read by the King (or the Lords\r\nCommissioners) at the Opening of Parliament.[234] In 1756 a spurious\r\nspeech was published and circulated, just before the opening, much to\r\nthe annoyance of the authorities. King George, however, took a lenient\r\nview of this outrage. He even expressed a hope that the printers might\r\nnot be too severely punished. He had read both speeches carefully, he\r\nsaid, and, as far as he could understand either, infinitely preferred\r\nthe spurious one to his own.[235]\r\n\r\n  [233] The Cockpit was pulled down in 1733, but the name continued to\r\n  be given to the Treasury meeting-room. See Dodington's \"Diary\": \"Went\r\n  to the Cockpit to a prize cause,\" p. 72 (1828).\r\n\r\n  [234] \"November 20, 1798. Called on Sir Francis Burdett, who had just\r\n  been reading in the newspaper the King's intended Speech to-day (which\r\n  for some sessions past has been published the morning before it is\r\n  spoken).\" Holcroft's \"Memoirs,\" p. 229.\r\n\r\n  [235] It was burnt by the hangman in Palace Yard. Waldegrave's\r\n  \"Memoirs,\" p. 89.\r\n\r\nThe King's Speech is not usually a very remarkable production, either\r\nfrom a literary or any other point of view, though many of those for\r\nwhich Gladstone, Disraeli, or Lord Salisbury were responsible were\r\nexceptionally lucid and well written. Macaulay has described it as\r\n\"that most unmeaningly evasive of human compositions.\" As a rule, it\r\nexudes platitudes at every paragraph; its phraseology is florid\r\nwithout being particularly informing. \"Did I deliver the Speech well?\"\r\nGeorge III. inquired of the Lord Chancellor, after the opening of\r\nParliament. \"Very well, Sire,\" was Lord Eldon's reply. \"I am glad of\r\nit,\" answered the King, \"for there was nothing in it!\"[236] If speech\r\nwas given us to conceal thought, the King's Speech may often be said\r\nto fulfil its mission as a cloak to drape the mind of the Ministry.\r\nLord Randolph Churchill once declared that the Cabinet had spent some\r\nfifteen hours eliminating from it anything that might possibly have\r\nany meaning. From the ambiguous suggestions it contains, the public is\r\nleft to infer the exact form of legislation foreshadowed. The King's\r\nSpeech is popularly supposed to be written by His Majesty himself. But\r\nthough approved by him, it is composed by the Prime Minister and the\r\nCabinet, of which probably each member contributes the paragraphs\r\nreferring to his own department. It expresses, therefore, the\r\nGovernment's rather than the sovereign's views.\r\n\r\n  [236] Twiss's \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 359.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria discontinued the reading of her Speech after the death\r\nof the Prince Consort, delegating this duty to the Lord Chancellor.\r\nOther monarchs, however, have usually been their own spokesmen on this\r\noccasion--sometimes at great personal inconvenience. William IV., in\r\nhis old age, found much difficulty in reading his Speech, one gloomy\r\nwinter's afternoon. The light in the Upper House was so poor that he\r\ncould scarcely decipher a word, and he was forced to refer perpetually\r\nfor assistance to Lord Melbourne. At last two wax tapers were brought,\r\nand the King, quietly remarking that the Speech had not received the\r\ntreatment that it deserved, proceeded to read it right through again\r\nfrom beginning to end.\r\n\r\nAnother royal personage treated the Speech with far less respect.\r\nGeorge IV., when Prince Regent, is said to have bet Sheridan a hundred\r\nguineas that he would introduce the words \"Baa, baa, black Sheep!\"\r\ninto the King's Speech without arousing comment or surprise. He won\r\nhis bet, and afterwards, when Sheridan asked Canning whether he did\r\nnot think it extraordinary that no one should have noticed so strange\r\nan interpolation: \"Did you not hear His Royal Highness say, 'Baa, baa,\r\nblack sheep'?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" replied Canning; \"but as he was\r\nlooking straight in your direction at the moment, I deemed it merely a\r\npersonal allusion, and thought no more about it!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the delivery of the King's Speech, His Majesty and the other\r\nmembers of the Royal Family retire from the Chamber, and the Commons\r\nreturn to their own House. Here the Speaker \"reports\" or reads the\r\nSpeech once more. In the House of Lords the Chancellor is undertaking\r\na similar duty, standing in his place at the Woolsack. Lords and\r\nCommons remain uncovered while the Speech is being read.\r\n\r\nBefore this happens, however, a Bill _pro formâ_ is read a first time\r\nin both Houses, on the motion of the two Leaders, as a sign that\r\nParliament has a right to deal with any matter in priority to those\r\nreferred to in the King's Speech.\r\n\r\nWhen this formality has been carried out and the Speech read, an\r\nAddress of thanks to the King is moved by two members of each House.\r\nThe motion for the Address is proposed and seconded by some rising\r\nyoung politicians selected by the Government, who are thus given an\r\nopportunity of displaying their oratorical prowess, and a debate\r\nensues. The debate on the Address originated in Edward III.'s reign,\r\nand sometimes lasted two or three days. It was the regular preliminary\r\nof Parliamentary deliberations. To-day in the Commons it occasionally\r\nextends over a whole fortnight, or even longer.\r\n\r\nAfter the Address has been agreed to, and ordered to be presented to\r\nHis Majesty, both Houses proceed to make various arrangements for the\r\nconduct of their internal affairs, committees of different kinds are\r\nappointed, and other preparations made for facilitating the labours of\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nParliament is now open, and the serious business of the Session\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nRULES OF DEBATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" says Bacon, \"that what is settled by custom, though it\r\nbe not good, at least is fit. It were good, therefore, that men in\r\ntheir innovations would follow the example of time itself, which,\r\nindeed, innovateth greatly, but quietly.\" Parliament has certainly\r\nacted upon this advice, and nowhere is the steady and silent\r\nlegislation by precedent more conspicuous than in the forms which\r\ngovern the procedure of both Houses. Occasional practices have become\r\nusages, growing with the growth of Parliament, adapting themselves\r\nimperceptibly to the circumstances which at once created and required\r\nthem, \"slowly broadening down from precedent to precedent,\" like that\r\nnational freedom of which the poet sings.\r\n\r\nParliament has kept as close as possible to the wings of Time, and, as\r\nPlunket said, has watched its progress and accommodated its motions to\r\ntheir flight, varying the forms and aspects of its institutions to\r\nreflect their varying aspects and forms. For if this were not the\r\nspirit that animated Parliament, \"history would be no better than an\r\nold almanack.\"[237] In spite of this, however, the maxim which Sir\r\nEdward Coke declared to be written on the walls of the House of\r\nCommons, that old ways are the safest and surest ways, still prevails,\r\nand it is not often that any parliamentarian has the courage to say,\r\nas Phillips said to Coke on a memorable occasion, \"If there be no\r\nprecedent for this, _it is time to make one_.\"[238]\r\n\r\n  [237] O'Flanagan's \"Lives of the Irish Chancellors,\" vol. ii. p. 541.\r\n  (The same simile was used by Boswell. See Croker's \"Dr. Johnson,\" vol.\r\n  iii. p. 41.)\r\n\r\n  [238] Forster's \"Sir John Eliot,\" vol. i. p. 405.\r\n\r\nThe machine of a free constitution, as Burke declared, is no simple\r\nthing, but as intricate and delicate as it is valuable; and to keep\r\nthat machine in good working order, to make the wheels run smoothly,\r\nit has been found necessary to frame a code of procedure which has its\r\nroots in the traditions and precedents of the parliamentary history of\r\nthe past. For hundreds of years any attempt to alter the ancient\r\nprocedure was looked upon as a kind of sacrilege. It was not until the\r\nSpeakership of Shaw Lefevre that any serious changes were made in the\r\nbusiness methods of Parliament, and Rules and Standing Orders devised\r\nto expedite business and reduce waste of time to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of order and the acceleration of business have always\r\nbeen the main objects sought for, for which provision is now made in\r\nthe Standing Orders of both Houses. These have been revised and their\r\nnumber increased from time to time, no fewer than twenty-one\r\ncommittees having been appointed between the years 1832 and 1881, for\r\nthe sole purpose of improving the procedure of the House of\r\nCommons.[239]\r\n\r\n  [239] Select Committees met in 1837, 1848, 1854, 1861 and 1871, and a\r\n  Joint Committee of both Houses considered the question in 1869.\r\n\r\nThe most important, perhaps, are those which refer to speaking in\r\ndebates--the chief duty of those who take any part in the\r\ndeliberations of Parliament.\r\n\r\nSpeeches in either House must be delivered in English and _extempore_,\r\nthe speaker standing uncovered above the bar. Formerly, when the House\r\nof Commons was in Committee, members could speak sitting, and nowadays\r\ninvalid members are usually allowed this privilege. Even these,\r\nhowever must obey the rule as to being bareheaded. The only occasion\r\non which a member may--and indeed must--speak sitting and covered is\r\nduring a division when a question of order arises upon which he wishes\r\nto address the House. Gladstone, who never wore his hat in the House,\r\nonce provoked loud cries of \"Order!\" by forgetting this last rule.\r\nRealising his mistake, he hastily borrowed the headgear of a friend.\r\nBeing, however, blessed with an unusually large head, his appearance\r\nin a hat several sizes too small for him caused much amusement.\r\n\r\nPeers and members occasionally wear their hats while sitting in their\r\nrespective Houses, as a protection from the glaring light or from the\r\nextraordinary draughts caused by the modern system of ventilation; but\r\nthey invariably uncover to move about from one place to another. They\r\nalso momentarily remove their hats when the Chancellor or Speaker\r\nenters, or when a message from the Crown is read. It is customary,\r\ntoo, to uncover as a sign of respect when a vote of thanks is proposed\r\nor an obituary speech made in memory of a deceased statesman. There is\r\nan instance in Stuart days of a member expressing his disapproval of a\r\nvote of thanks by clasping his hands upon the crown of his hat and\r\ncramming it down over his eyes, but this has never been repeated.\r\n\r\nThe Quaker Pease was always disinclined to comply with the rule that\r\nmembers should walk about the House uncovered. A doorkeeper was\r\ntherefore instructed to remove this member's hat quietly as he\r\nentered, and keep it safely hidden until he wished to leave. After a\r\ntime, Pease became accustomed to doing this for himself, and the\r\ndoorkeeper was relieved of his duty.[240]\r\n\r\n  [240] Pryme's \"Recollections,\" p. 220.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, like Gladstone, sat bareheaded in the House of Commons, but\r\nkept his hat under his seat ready for an emergency. It was then the\r\ngeneral custom of members to wear their hats in the House, but\r\nfashions have changed, and Cabinet Ministers to-day generally leave\r\ntheir head-gear in the private rooms with which they are now\r\naccommodated, while humbler legislators make use of the hat-pegs\r\nprovided for the purpose in the entrance hall of both Houses.\r\n\r\nIn the Commons, as we have already noted, the member who first\r\ncatches the Speaker's eye has the prior claim to speak. In the Lords a\r\ndifferent rule obtains. Should two peers rise simultaneously, one\r\nusually gives way to the other. Otherwise the House decides, if\r\nnecessary by a division, which of the two is to address it.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords peers address their fellows; in the Commons\r\nmembers are bidden to direct their remarks to the Speaker, or in\r\nCommittee to the Chairman. This practice dates from the old days when\r\nthe Speaker was the mouthpiece of the House and it was very necessary\r\nfor members to make clear to him the exact nature of their grievances\r\nor petitions, so that he might transfer them correctly to the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn the Commons the rules prescribe that no reference to previous\r\ndebates of the same Session shall be made, unless these were upon the\r\nsubject now under discussion. It is likewise \"out of order\" to read\r\nfrom a newspaper or book any printed speech made within the same\r\nSession. No allusion is allowed to speeches made in the other Chamber,\r\nthe idea being that debates are secret and unknown. This rule,\r\nhowever, is neatly evaded by the simple process of referring to\r\n\"another place,\" a euphemism under which members of either House can\r\ndisguise their allusions to the proceedings of the other.\r\n\r\nSeditious or treasonable words are sternly forbidden in Parliament, as\r\nis also the use of the sovereign's name to influence debates. No\r\nmember may commit contempt of court by referring to matters that are\r\n_sub judice_, nor may he insult the character or proceedings of either\r\nHouse, or use his right of speech for the purpose of obstructing\r\npublic business in his own.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1610, \"a member speaking, and his Speech seeming impertinent,\r\nand there being much Hissing and Spitting. It was conceived for a\r\nRule, that _Mr. Speaker may stay Impertinent Speeches_.\"[241] Thirty\r\nyears later an order of the House was framed, whereby, \"If any touch\r\nanother by nipping or irreverent speech, the Speaker may admonish\r\nhim. If he range in evil words, then to interrupt him, saying: 'I pray\r\nyou to spare those words.'\"[242] Nowadays debate must be relevant to\r\nthe matter before the House, and the Speaker may not only call upon an\r\nimpertinent or irrelevant member to cease speaking, but may even use\r\nhis discretion as to refusing to propose to the House a motion which\r\nhe considers to be of a purely obstructive character.\r\n\r\n  [241] Scobell's \"Rules and Customs of Parliament,\" p. 19.\r\n\r\n  [242] \"Orders, Proceedings, Punishments, and Privileges,\" etc.\r\n  (\"Harleian Miscellany,\" vol. v. p. 259.)\r\n\r\nDisorderly conduct in Parliament was punishable by fine in 1640, when\r\nStrode, ever a stickler for parliamentary decorum, moved that \"every\r\none coming into the House who did not take his place, or did, after\r\ntaking his place, talk so loud as to interrupt the business of the\r\nHouse from being heard, should pay a shilling fine, to be divided\r\nbetween the sergeant and the poor.\"[243]\r\n\r\n  [243] Forster's \"Grand Remonstrance,\" p. 206 n.\r\n\r\nSince Strode's day a number of further regulations have been added to\r\nthe code of parliamentary procedure, but the Speaker's task of keeping\r\norder is facilitated by the desire on the part of every member to\r\nuphold the authority of the Chair. This expresses itself in the\r\ncourtesy with which that piece of furniture, or rather, its occupant,\r\nis treated. Whenever a member of the House of Commons passes the Chair\r\nhe accords it a slight bow, and this rule is never willingly\r\ninfringed. He bows to it when he enters the chamber, and again when he\r\nleaves, and is always particularly careful not to intercept his person\r\nbetween it and the speaker who happens to be addressing the House. In\r\nthe Upper House, the Woolsack is treated with similar deference, no\r\nlord knowingly passing between it and any other lord who is speaking,\r\nor between it and the table. There being no Speaker authorized to keep\r\norder in the Lords, when \"heat is engendered in debate,\" it is open to\r\nany peer to move that an ancient Standing Order referring to asperity\r\nof speech be read by the Clerk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN 1910]\r\n\r\nWhether or not language be \"parliamentary\" is always a matter\r\ndifficult to determine. In the House of Commons it is left entirely to\r\nthe discretion of the Chair. Lord Melbourne remembered a Speaker\r\nruling it out of order to refer to any one as \"a member of the\r\nOpposition.\"[244] Even the familiar \"Hear! hear!\"--the modern version\r\nof \"Hear him!\" which was the sign of approbation in the days of\r\nPitt--has been ruled to be disorderly, if uttered in an offensive\r\nmanner. Major O'Gorman was \"named\" by Speaker Brand for insisting that\r\nhe had the right to shout \"Hear! hear!\" after every word, every\r\nsemi-colon, and every comma of a member's speech. In 1887, Speaker\r\nPeel called the attention of the House to the fact that \"Shame!\" was\r\nan unparliamentary expression, and rebuked an Irish member for\r\ncontinuously shouting \"Order! Order!\" in a disorderly manner.\r\n\r\n  [244] Torrens' \"Life of Melbourne,\" vol. ii. p. 375.\r\n\r\nAny epithet which reflects upon the character of a member of either\r\nHouse, or upon the conduct of the King or of others in high places, is\r\nconsidered to be disorderly, though notice is not always taken of it.\r\nIn 1672, on the first day that Lord Shaftesbury took his seat as Lord\r\nChancellor, the Duke of York called him a rascal and a villain. \"I am\r\nmuch obliged to your Royal Highness for not calling me likewise a\r\ncoward and a Papist,\" was the Chancellor's urbane reply. When Feargus\r\nO'Connor, in 1848, denying the charge of Republicanism that had been\r\nbrought against him, said that he didn't care whether the Queen or the\r\ndevil sat on the Throne, what threatened to develop into a\r\ndisagreeable incident was averted by the pleasantries of the Prime\r\nMinister. \"When the honourable gentleman sees the sovereign of his\r\nchoice on the throne of these realms,\" said Peel, \"I hope he will\r\nenjoy, and I feel sure he will deserve, the confidence of the Crown!\"\r\n\r\nMatters were not always so easily smoothed over. In 1675, during the\r\ndebate on the Address, Coke was committed to the Tower for remarking,\r\n\"I hope we are all Englishmen, and are not to be frightened out of\r\nour duty by a few high words\"--an observation which was considered to\r\ncast a reflection upon James II. In 1823 Canning stigmatized as\r\n\"false\" a statement of Brougham's, and for a long time refused to\r\nwithdraw the offensive expression. The worthy Plimsoll was carried\r\naway by feelings of righteous indignation in 1875, and referred to\r\ncertain shipowners, who were also members of the House, as \"villains.\"\r\nIt was not until a week later that he could be induced to apologise.\r\nO'Connell called Lord Alvanley a \"bloated buffoon,\" and declared\r\nDisraeli to be the lineal descendant of the impenitent thief on the\r\nCross.[245] Disraeli himself, in 1846, likened Lord John Russell to a\r\nvulture, and Mr. Biggar was termed an \"impudent scoundrel\" by a\r\nfellow-member in 1881. Nine years later Dr. Tanner referred to Mr.\r\nMatthews, the Home Secretary, as \"one of the basest and meanest skunks\r\nthat ever sat upon that bench\"; and among the titles which have been\r\nfreely conferred upon Mr. Chamberlain by his enemies, \"Judas\" and\r\n\"d----d liar\" are by no means the most opprobrious. Such language,\r\nhowever, is mercifully rare, and no modern Prime Minister could say,\r\nas Lord North did to the alderman who presented a petition from the\r\nelectors of Billingsgate, that the honourable gentleman spoke not only\r\nthe sentiments, but even the very language of his constituents.\r\n\r\n  [245] Grant's \"Recollections of the House of Lords,\" p. 407. Lord\r\n  Alvanley was the sporting peer who out hunting met a well-known West\r\n  End artist in pastry who was having some trouble with his horse. \"I\r\n  can't hold him,\" said the confectioner, \"he's so devilish hot!\" \"Why\r\n  don't you ice him, Mr. Gunter?\" said Lord Alvanley.--(Maddyn's \"Chiefs\r\n  of States,\" vol. ii. p. 214.)\r\n\r\nA member may not speak at all unless a question is before the House,\r\nor he intends to conclude with a motion or amendment; but an exception\r\nis made in favour of a personal explanation, or of a question of\r\nprivilege suddenly arising, which commands precedence over all other\r\nbusiness. Questions also may be addressed to Ministers before public\r\nbusiness commences, and the latter may make statements of public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nSave when the House is in Committee, a member or peer is not allowed\r\nto speak twice upon the same question, unless on a point of order, or\r\nto explain some unintelligible portion of a first speech. If, however,\r\nhe has moved a substantive motion, he has a right of reply at the end\r\nof the debate. Once when Lord North was speaking, a dog ran barking\r\ninto the House. \"Mr. Speaker,\" said the Prime Minister, \"I am\r\ninterrupted by a new member!\" The dog was eventually driven out with\r\nsome difficulty, but shortly afterwards re-entered by another door,\r\nwhen it began barking as loudly as ever. Lord North remarked dryly\r\nthat the new member had spoken once already, and was consequently\r\nviolating the rules of the House.[246]\r\n\r\n  [246] Harford's \"Recollections of Wilberforce,\" p. 93. An exception to\r\n  this rule was made on November 4, 1909, when, in accordance with the\r\n  general wish of the House, the Speaker permitted the Prime Minister\r\n  and the Leader of the Opposition to speak, although both had already\r\n  joined in the debate on the previous night.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords peers speak of one another by name, but in the\r\nCommons it is the custom to refer to colleagues by their\r\nconstituencies, as \"the Honourable (or Right Hon.) gentleman, the\r\nmember for Hull (or West Birmingham, etc.).\" The title \"honourable\" is\r\nalways used in conjunction with a member's name, but should be\r\nreinforced by the epithet \"gallant\" or \"learned\" in the case of a\r\nnaval (or military) member, or of a lawyer.[247]\r\n\r\n  [247] Sir Wilfred Lawson was once sarcastically referred to as \"the\r\n  honourable and amusing baronet\" (See \"Men and Manners,\" p. 152.)\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the Reform Act of 1832 that the practice of\r\nreferring to members by their constituencies came into fashion. In\r\nStuart days it was not customary to mention either the names or the\r\nconstituencies of members. They were simply referred to as \"the\r\ngentleman on the other side of the way,\" \"the member that last spake,\"\r\netc. Nowadays it is usual to talk of a member, if on the same side of\r\nthe House, as \"my honourable friend\"; and if on the opposite side, as\r\n\"the honourable gentleman (or member).\" But opponents sometimes\r\npublicly include one another within the sacred circle of honourable\r\nfriendship, though politically they may be the bitterest enemies.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of procedure regulating the length of speeches in\r\neither House. A man may speak for as long as he likes, the only limit\r\nbeing set by his own powers of endurance or the patience of his\r\naudience; but his remarks must be relevant. \"If any speak too long,\r\nand speak _within the matter_, he may not be cut off; but if he be\r\nlong, and _out of the matter_, then may the Speaker gently admonish\r\nhim of the shortness of the time, or the business of the House, and\r\npray him to make as short he may.\"[248] As a matter of practice his\r\nfellow-members will probably have admonished him of the shortness of\r\nthe time long before by shouting \"'Vide! 'Vide!\" until he brings his\r\nspeech to a welcome close.\r\n\r\n  [248] \"Orders, Proceedings, Punishments, and Privileges of the\r\n  Commons\" (\"Harleian Miscellany,\" vol. v. p. 8).\r\n\r\nThe determination to proceed in spite of this hint that his efforts\r\nare unappreciated only increases the uproar, for, as Burke once said,\r\nthe House of Commons has an intense dislike for anything resembling\r\nobstinacy.[249] A Khedive of Egypt, who visited the House of Commons\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century, and listened with surprise\r\nto the deafening noise made by a political audience, came to the\r\nconclusion that the shouting of \"'Vide!\" was the ordinary English mode\r\nof expressing intense boredom. On his return to Egypt he suffered much\r\nfrom the protracted interviews which he was compelled to grant to Sir\r\nJohn Bowring, a prosy talker, who had been sent to Cairo in 1837 on a\r\ncommercial mission. The Khedive's patience finally became exhausted,\r\nand one day, while Sir John was as usual addressing him at\r\nunconscionable length, His Highness began exclaiming \"'Vide! 'Vide!\r\n'Vide!\" and continued doing so until his visitor was reduced to\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n  [249] \"The House has a character of its own. Like all great public\r\n  collections of men, it possesses a marked love of virtue and an\r\n  abhorrence of vice. But among vices there is none which the House\r\n  abhors in the same degree with _obstinacy_\" (\"Works and\r\n  Correspondence,\" vol. iii. p. 215).\r\n\r\nThe words of Speaker Spencer Compton have often been quoted to show\r\nthat members are acting within their rights in preventing the delivery\r\nof a speech; that, as Bright said, the House can employ noise \"as a\r\nremedy\" against a dull or prolix speaker. A member appealed to Compton\r\nto restore order, urging that he had a right to be heard. \"No, sir,\"\r\nreplied the Speaker, \"you have a right to speak, but the House has a\r\nright to judge whether they will hear you!\" This, according to so\r\ngreat an authority as Hatsell, was an altogether wrong decision, the\r\nSpeaker's chief duty being to keep the House attentive and quiet.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords, where there is no Speaker to curtail a lengthy\r\nor irrelevant speech, any peer may propose that the noble lord who is\r\non his legs \"be no longer heard\"--a disagreeable but effective way of\r\ninforming a bore of his prolixity.[250] This method was unsuccessfully\r\ntried in the Commons in 1880. O'Donnell had put down a question asking\r\nwhether M. Challemel Lacour, the prospective French Ambassador at the\r\nCourt of St. James's, had, \"as one of the Prefects of the Provisional\r\nGovernment of September 4, 1870, ordered the massacre of Colonel\r\nLatour's battalion, and had been fined £3000 by a Court of Justice for\r\nplundering a convent.\" Gladstone moved that the honourable member \"be\r\nno longer heard;\" but the Speaker, on being appealed to, stated that\r\nthis was an unusual course, which had certainly not been adopted for\r\nat least two hundred years. A \"scene\" ensued, and finally O'Donnell\r\nwas induced to put down the question again for a later date. Before\r\nthis day arrived, however, the Speaker tactfully managed to suppress\r\nthe question altogether, as being \"beyond the cognisance of the House\r\nor the Queen's Government.\"\r\n\r\n  [250] The last instance of this occurred on May 6, 1884, when Lord\r\n  Waveney was addressing the House.\r\n\r\nOccasional efforts have been made to stem the flow of parliamentary\r\neloquence in the Commons, but without much success. The late Sir Carne\r\nRasch tried for years to shorten speeches, but in vain. Mr. Hogan\r\nsought to introduce the New Zealand scheme, whereby the Speaker rings\r\na bell when any member has spoken for twenty minutes; but though Mr.\r\nBalfour declared that twenty minutes erred on the side of generosity,\r\nnothing came of this suggestion. In spite of a good deal of\r\nunnecessary talking, the House of Commons gets through a lot of work,\r\nthough there is no doubt that, as Bright said, more business could be\r\ndone if so much time were not wasted in unprofitable eloquence.[251]\r\nDr. Johnson, visiting a musical family of his acquaintance, suggested\r\nthat they should all perform together. \"There will then,\" he\r\nexplained, \"be more noise, but it will be sooner over.\" Similar\r\nsuggestions have been made with regard to the House of Commons, but\r\nthe question of stifling parliamentary loquacity remains unsolved.\r\n\r\n  [251] \"I must say that it (the House of Commons) would be a better\r\n  machine if men were a little less vain, and would adopt a policy of\r\n  silence. If they would be anxious to get through the business of the\r\n  House without so much anxiety for self-exhibition as I have sometimes\r\n  observed, I think the House of Commons might do a good deal more work,\r\n  and very much better work than it does at present.\"--Speech at the\r\n  Fishmongers' Hall, April 27, 1881.\r\n\r\nWhen such loquacity was deliberately employed to delay business,\r\nobstruction took various forms, of which the favourite one a few years\r\nago consisted of motions to adjourn the debate or adjourn the House.\r\nSheridan once made this motion nineteen successive times, until\r\nmembers were so tired of tramping through the lobbies that they gave\r\nin and went home.[252] In 1831, on July 12th, the opponents of the\r\nReform Bill saw that their only hope lay in retarding the business of\r\nthe House. They set about to force a division on repeated motions for\r\nadjournment, and it was not until 7.30 a.m. of the following day that\r\nthe Commons at length adjourned. Sir Charles Wetherell, who led the\r\nOpposition on this occasion, came out of the House to find that it\r\nwas raining hard. \"By God!\" said he, \"if I'd known this, they should\r\nhave had a few more divisions!\"[253]\r\n\r\n  [252] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 53. Nowadays no member can make this\r\n  motion more than once.\r\n\r\n  [253] Molesworth's \"History of the Reform Bill,\" p. 214.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, and again ten years later, the Irish party resisted two Bills\r\nby this means, on the latter occasion calling for no less than\r\nforty-four divisions. And when the Copyright Bill of 1839 was being\r\ndebated, a minority of nine members compelled one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven of their colleagues to divide sixteen times.\r\n\r\nThere is, as Gladstone said, no art or science which has made such\r\nadvance in modern times as has that of parliamentary obstruction.\r\nGladstone himself resolutely and systematically obstructed the passage\r\nof the Divorce Bill, as Sir Robert Peel before him had obstructed Lord\r\nGrey's Reform Bill. These statesmen, however, employed a recognised\r\nform of opposition to some particular measure. It was left for the\r\nIrish party to devise a system of regular opposition to the conduct of\r\nany parliamentary business whatsoever.\r\n\r\nParnell's knowledge of the rules of debate was extensive and peculiar.\r\nHe himself acted upon the advice which he once gave to a new member\r\nwhen he told him that the best way to learn the regulations of the\r\nHouse was by breaking them. It was he who originated the idea of\r\nemploying what he called \"the sacred right of obstruction\" as a\r\nprotest against the alleged Government neglect of Irish grievances. He\r\nsought by this means to show that, though his party was not powerful\r\nenough to carry through its own work properly, it was sufficiently\r\nstrong to prevent the English Government from doing any work at all.\r\nIn this way he no doubt thought to carry out the last wishes of\r\nGrattan, and to \"keep knocking at the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe forms of the House of Commons, as Sir George Cornwall Lewis has\r\nsaid, were avowedly contrived for the protection of minorities; and\r\nthey are so effectual for their purpose as frequently to defeat the\r\nwill of the great body of the House, and enable a few members to\r\nresist, at least for a time, a measure desired by the majority.[254]\r\nThe Irish have, of course, always been dissatisfied. If they had\r\nhappened to be in the wilderness with Moses, as Bright once observed,\r\nthey would probably have complained of the Ten Commandments as a\r\nharassing piece of legislation--and not altogether without\r\njustification. But in 1874, when they adopted the attitude of\r\nantagonism to the transaction of all business, obstruction in such a\r\nform as this was a novelty, and their more constitutionally-minded\r\nleader, Butt, repudiated Parnell and his methods. The latter was not\r\nto be moved from his purpose, however, and with half a dozen intrepid\r\nand obstinate followers continued the practice of an organized plan of\r\nobstruction, of which the only flattering thing that can be said is\r\nthat it was for a long time completely successful.\r\n\r\n  [254] See \"Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion,\" p. 219.\r\n\r\nParnell himself deliberately expressed his satisfaction in thwarting\r\nthe Government and preventing the progress of parliamentary business.\r\nHe gloried in his offence, thinking very probably that England's\r\ndifficulty was Ireland's opportunity. On sixty-nine occasions in 1877,\r\nwhen the House of Commons was forced to divide, the minorities never\r\nconsisted of more than eleven members, and in one hundred divisions\r\nthey did not exceed twenty-one. Parnell addressed the House five\r\nhundred times in the session of 1879, constantly repeating the same\r\narguments, raising points which had already been ruled out of order,\r\nmaking a variety of frivolous objections, and showing in a hundred\r\nways that his evident desire was merely to waste the time of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nOwing to obstructive Irish tactics, the Land Act of 1881 required no\r\nless than fifty-eight sittings before it could be passed. In the same\r\nyear the climax of obstruction was reached, and it became obvious that\r\nsome measures must be taken to prevent the continuation of such a\r\nstate of affairs. On January 31, which was a Monday, the House of\r\nCommons met at 4.30 p.m. and sat without interval until 9.30 a.m. on\r\nthe following Wednesday. But for the intervention of the Chair, the\r\nsitting might have been prolonged indefinitely. Fortunately, Speaker\r\nBrand was a strong man, and had privately determined to put a stop to\r\na condition of things which was bringing the House into contempt and\r\nthreatening the complete breakdown of all legislative business.\r\n\r\nOn resuming the Chair on the Wednesday morning, the Speaker rose and\r\naddressed the House in a carefully prepared speech. He began by\r\nexpressing his unqualified disapproval of the continual obstruction of\r\na stubborn and inconsiderable minority, whereby the ordinary rules of\r\nprocedure had been rendered ineffective, and the dignity of the House\r\nendangered. Acting on his own responsibility, he declared that a new\r\ncourse was imperatively demanded. He declined therefore to call upon\r\nany more members to speak, and proceeded to \"put the question,\"\r\nrelying upon the House to support him in this unusual act.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker had accurately gauged the \"sense of the House\";[255] his\r\nsolution of the difficulty was loudly applauded, save of course upon\r\nthe Irish benches, and, after a sitting that had lasted for over\r\nforty-one consecutive hours, weary members were at last enabled to\r\nenjoy a well-earned repose.\r\n\r\n  [255] With regard to those well-worn expressions, the \"sense\" of the\r\n  House and the \"feeling\" of the House, it has been stated that the\r\n  House of Commons has more sense and feeling than any one who sits upon\r\n  its benches: \"The collective wisdom of Parliament exceeds the wisdom\r\n  of any single head therein.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this memorable scene, a new set of rules was framed,\r\nrestricting debate on all dilatory motions, and preventing any member\r\nfrom making them more than once. The authority of the Speaker also was\r\nincreased, and it was made optional for him to put the question\r\nforthwith, if he thought the rules were being abused. He was also\r\nendowed with the power of at any time silencing an unruly or\r\nobstructive member.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, Gladstone proposed an alteration of the Procedure\r\nRegulations, which allowed the Speaker or Chairman, when a subject had\r\nbeen adequately discussed, and it was evidently the sense of the House\r\nthat the question be put, so to inform the House; and, if a motion to\r\nthis effect was put and carried, supported by more than two hundred\r\nmembers, or supported by one hundred and opposed by less than forty,\r\nthe question was to be put forthwith. This \"Closure\" rule was amended\r\nsix years later, when it was resolved that, after a question had been\r\nproposed, any member could move that \"the question be now put,\" and,\r\nwith the Speaker's approval, this motion might be put without debate,\r\nprovided that in the division not less than one hundred members voted\r\nin its support.\r\n\r\nStill more stringent regulations have since been made to thwart the\r\nobstructive tendencies of a certain section of every Opposition. By a\r\nrecent Standing Order, the end of a debate may be fixed by resolution\r\nof the House for a certain hour and date, and, if the subject is not\r\ndisposed of by that time, the undiscussed remainder must be decided by\r\na vote upon which there can be no debate. This is known as the\r\n\"guillotine\" or \"closure by compartments,\" and has been commented on\r\nadversely by all minorities and sedulously practised by every\r\nGovernment since its inception.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the many efforts which have been made to\r\naccelerate business, the parliamentary machine moves but slowly, and\r\nthe time spent in discussing any measure to which there is active,\r\nsincere, and persistent opposition shows no signs of diminishing in\r\nlength. Thus, while the Home Rule Bill of 1893 required 180 divisions,\r\nthe Education Bill of 1902 required 295; and over the Finance Bill of\r\n1909 Parliament spent something like 73 days (or 740 hours) and\r\ndivided no less than 420 times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE AND PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament has ever been most tenacious of its historic and\r\ntraditionary rights and privileges. Of these, freedom of speech and\r\nfreedom from arrest may be considered the most important. The right of\r\npersonal access to the Crown is claimed by peers, any one of whom may\r\ndemand a private audience with the sovereign, and, though the Commons\r\nare not granted a similar privilege, it is permissible for them to\r\naccompany their Speaker when he presents an address to the King, and\r\nto wear ordinary dress on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nIn olden days peers enjoyed other indulgences denied to their humbler\r\nbrethren. They were, for instance, permitted to kill deer in the\r\nKing's forests whenever, in obedience to a royal summons, they\r\njourneyed to or from the sovereign. At such times the bag was limited\r\nto two deer, and these might only be slain in the presence of the\r\nKing's Forester. If that official were not at hand, the sporting peer\r\nwas enjoined to blow several loud blasts upon his hunting-horn before\r\npursuing his quarry to the death.[256] Peers were further allowed\r\n\"benefit of clergy,\" in the good old days, for such crimes as highway\r\nrobbery, horse-stealing and house-breaking, but only for a first\r\noffence. If they took up burglary as a hobby, or if the robbery of\r\nchurches became with them a daily habit, they could no longer escape\r\nfrom the consequences of their misdeeds, and were haled to prison just\r\nas though they had been mere ordinary mortals. \"Benefit of clergy\"\r\nwas a privilege which was repealed by Act of Parliament in 1801, and a\r\npeer to-day cannot steal a single gold watch with impunity.\r\n\r\n  [256] Pike's \"Constitutional History,\" p. 267.\r\n\r\nExemption from arrest on a civil process during the session, or for\r\nforty days before and after, is a privilege which members of the House\r\nof Commons as well as the Lords have always enjoyed.[257] It extended\r\nto their estates until 1857, and to their servants until 1892. This\r\nimmunity does not, however, extend to breaches of the criminal law,\r\nnor can it be claimed in the case of an indictable offence or of\r\ncontempt of court, its original object being merely to secure freedom\r\nof arrival and attendance. The Speaker of the Commons, Thomas Thorpe,\r\nwho was summoned in Henry VI.'s time for carrying away certain goods\r\nand chattels from the Bishop of Durham's Palace, was fined £1000, and\r\ncommitted to the Fleet until this sum should be paid. The question of\r\nprivilege was raised, but the House of Lords decided that the culprit\r\nmust remain in prison, and the Commons were directed to elect another\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n  [257] Peeresses may also claim this as a right.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Parliament, privilege from arrest was generally\r\nenforced by a resolution of the House or by a Chancery writ, though\r\nthere is at least one instance of a member being released without any\r\nsuch formality. This occurred in the case of a member named Ferrars,\r\nwho had been arrested for debt by the Sheriff of London in 1543. The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms who went to demand his release was illtreated, and\r\nsent back empty-handed. The House thereupon summoned the sheriff to\r\nthe Bar, and with him the creditor who had sued Ferrars, and committed\r\nboth to prison.\r\n\r\nIn 1575 the privilege was extended, the servants of members of the\r\nHouse of Commons being included within the pale of its protection.\r\nThis naturally led to many abuses, culminating in the case of the\r\nnotorious Colonel Wanklyn. This member gave a signed \"protection\" to a\r\nwealthy friend whom he falsely named as his servant in order to\r\nenable him to escape the payment of a debt which he owed to his own\r\nwife. The fraud being made public, the culprit was expelled from the\r\nHouse, and went away weeping bitterly, \"to the scandal of his brother\r\nofficers.\"[258] In the same year a man named Smalley, the servant of\r\nArthur Hall, member for Grantham, was arrested for debt and released\r\nby the Speaker's order. It was afterwards discovered that he had\r\narranged his arrest so as to elude his financial liabilities, and the\r\nindignant House ordered him to be imprisoned and fined £100.[259]\r\nFurther discredit was cast upon one of the ancient privileges of\r\nParliament by another member named Benson, who was found guilty of\r\nselling \"protections\" at sixteen shillings apiece, and was turned out\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\n  [258] Townsend's \"History,\" vol. i. p. 253.\r\n\r\n  [259] Raikes's \"Journal,\" vol. i. p. 320.\r\n\r\nIf the Commons were justly severe in their treatment of members who\r\nabused this particular privilege, they punished with even greater\r\nseverity any unfortunate persons who attempted to violate it. In 1584\r\nan official of the mighty Star Chamber was committed to the Tower for\r\ndaring to serve a _subpoena_ on a member of Parliament. At the\r\nbeginning of the next century, two officers who had arrested a\r\nmember's servant were condemned to ride together upon a single horse,\r\nback to back, through the streets of London. In this insecure and\r\nundignified position they were taken from Westminster to the Exchange,\r\nwearing upon their breasts a placard inscribed with their offence, an\r\nawful example to all who would dream of laying hands on the sacred\r\npersons of parliamentarians or their dependents.\r\n\r\nThe immunity which members had hitherto enjoyed was slightly modified\r\nin 1700, when an Act was passed permitting civil suits to be commenced\r\nagainst them after a dissolution or prorogation, or during any\r\nadjournment of more than fourteen days. Later on, in George III.'s\r\nreign, their privileges were still further curtailed, their persons\r\nalone being held sacred, and that for a period of only forty days\r\nbefore or after the meeting of Parliament. Use was still made of this\r\nprivilege as a shield from the power of the law, and as late as 1807\r\nthere are instances of the unscrupulous purchase of seats in the\r\nCommons for the sole purpose of obtaining release from prison or\r\nescaping the payment of debt.\r\n\r\nTo this day members of Parliament are safe from arrest within the\r\nprecincts of the Palace of Westminster. Irish members who had been\r\nconvicted under the Coercion Act, in the palmy days of the Land\r\nLeague, found in the House of Commons a useful if only temporary\r\nsanctuary. Dr. Tanner took his seat there at a time when a warrant for\r\nhis arrest had been issued, and it was not until the adjournment of\r\nthe House and the return to his hotel of this member, so badly \"wanted\r\nby the police,\" that he could be lawfully apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe jealous care with which Parliament guarded its rights in olden\r\ndays often threatened to bring the very name of privilege into\r\ncontempt. The Commons especially acquired the pernicious habit of\r\nvoting that whatsoever displeased them was an insult to Parliament,\r\nrequiring instant and drastic punishment. Books or sermons which\r\ncriticized or reflected upon the doings of either House were condemned\r\nwholesale, confiscated, and publicly burnt by the common hangman;\r\nauthors or preachers were imprisoned and otherwise penalized. \"The\r\nParliament-men are as great Princes as any in the World,\" says Selden,\r\n\"when whatsoever they please is privilege of Parliament; no man must\r\nknow the number of their privileges, and whatsoever they dislike is\r\nbreach of privilege.\"[260]\r\n\r\n  [260] \"Table Talk,\" p. 109.\r\n\r\nImpeachment, imprisonment, fines, confiscation of property, or\r\ncommittal to the Tower, were among the penalties meted out with a\r\nlavish hand to all who gave offence to the Commons. In 1624, Dr.\r\nHarrys, vicar of Blechingly, was brought to the bar of the Commons for\r\ninterfering at elections, and compelled to confess his guilt, and\r\nafterwards to apologise to his parishioners. A Welsh judge named\r\nJenkins was summoned before the Long Parliament for having called the\r\nHouse of Commons a den of thieves, and, on refusing to \"bow himself in\r\nthis house of Rimmon,\" was sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nThe most trivial faults, the most innocent acts, were from time to\r\ntime voted contempts of Parliament, and the offenders chastised with a\r\nbarbarity which was out of all proportion to the nature of their\r\nmisdeeds. So harmless an offence as crowding or jostling against a\r\nmember of Parliament was at one time considered a crime. In the days\r\nwhen the great Arthur Onslow occupied the Chair of the House of\r\nCommons, it was his custom to traverse Westminster Hall on his way to\r\nthe House, saluting the Judges as he passed. An unfortunate man who\r\naccidentally blocked the Speaker's path on one occasion was instantly\r\nordered into custody.[261]\r\n\r\n  [261] Hatsell's \"Precedents,\" vol. ii. p. 241 n.\r\n\r\nPoaching the game of a member of Parliament was also adjudged a\r\nmisdemeanour worthy of severe retribution. A poacher who trespassed on\r\nthe fishing rights of Admiral Griffiths, M.P., in 1759, was\r\nreprimanded on his knees at the bar of the Commons.[262]\r\n\r\n  [262] Lord Russell's \"Essays and Sketches,\" p. 346.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of fraudulent petitions has always been regarded as a\r\nbreach of parliamentary privilege; and, in 1887, a man named Bidmead,\r\nwho presented a petition which was found to be full of false\r\nsignatures, was brought to the bar and severely reprimanded. This\r\nprocess of haling an offender to the bar to receive the censure of the\r\nHouse was an impressive one, calculated to strike fear into the\r\nboldest heart. The culprit was brought in, in the custody of the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, and compelled to kneel at the bar, where the Speaker\r\nsentenced him in his severest tones to such penalties as the House\r\ndeemed sufficient to expiate his crime. One wretched prisoner was so\r\nalarmed that he had a fit, and was carried out in an unconscious\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe rule requiring an offender to kneel was not finally repealed until\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. In 1751 an attorney named\r\nCrowle was reprimanded on his knees for misconduct of some kind or\r\nother at an election. On rising to his feet Mr. Crowle carefully wiped\r\nthe knees of his trousers, remarking contemptuously that he had never\r\nbefore been in so dirty a house.[263] In this same year Alexander\r\nMurray, brother of the Jacobite Lord Elibank, was summoned for\r\nobstructing the High Bailiff of Westminster at election time. He\r\nresolutely declined to kneel when brought to the Commons bar, nor\r\ncould the threats or entreaties of the Sergeant-at-Arms prevail upon\r\nhim to conform to the rules of the House in this respect. \"I never\r\nkneel but to God,\" he said. \"When I have committed a crime I kneel to\r\nGod for pardon, but, knowing my own innocence, I can kneel to no one\r\nelse.\" As a punishment for his obstinacy, Murray was committed to\r\nNewgate, and remained there until the prorogation of Parliament. The\r\nclose of the session operated as his release, and he was acclaimed in\r\ntriumph by the City populace. When Parliament met again he was once\r\nmore committed, but fled abroad, and so escaped further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n  [263] Oldfield's \"History of the House of Commons,\" vol. i. p. 420.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony of enforced kneeling was a humiliation repulsive to\r\nmany. Windham told Fanny Burney that the sight of Warren Hastings on\r\nhis knees at the bar was so repugnant to his feelings that he looked\r\nthe other way to avoid seeing the degradation of the impeached\r\nstatesman. \"It hurt me,\" he says, \"and I wished it dispensed\r\nwith.\"[264] This wish soon became universal, and the practice was\r\ndiscontinued in 1772, Baldwin, the printer of the \"St. James's\r\nChronicle,\" who was reprimanded for publishing a report of the\r\nparliamentary proceedings, being the last man to kneel at the bar of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n  [264] \"Diary and Letters of Mme. D'Arblay,\" vol. iv.\r\n\r\nWhen a member of Parliament incurs the displeasure of the House its\r\ncensure may be visited upon him in various ways, either by a\r\nreprimand, or by fine, or by committal to prison. The first instance\r\nof the Commons punishing one of their own number occurs in 1547, when\r\na member named Storie was arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms for\r\nspeaking disrespectfully of the Duke of Somerset, and was confined to\r\nthe Tower. The House of Commons has never allowed its members to\r\nreflect upon the conduct of those in high places. It also forbids any\r\ncriticism of a Resolution of the House, unless the critical member\r\nintends to conclude with a motion for rescinding it. Eight years after\r\nthe committal of Storie, another member, Dr. Parry by name, was\r\nbrought to the bar for speaking in the House against a Bill that had\r\nalready passed its third reading, saying that it was \"full of\r\nconfiscations, blood, danger, despair, and terror to the English\r\nsubjects of this realm, their brothers, uncles, and kinsfolk.\"[265]\r\nDr. Parry absolutely declined to give his reasons for holding this\r\nview, nor would he deign to explain why the Bill should cause his\r\nuncles to become desperate and terrorstricken. He was therefore\r\ncommitted to the Tower, and expelled from the House. Later on an\r\naccusation of treason was brought against him, and a motion made (but,\r\nlet us hope, not carried) that he be executed. In 1581, another\r\nmember, Arthur Hall, was fined and imprisoned in the Tower for\r\npublishing a book of a slanderous character.\r\n\r\n  [265] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 341.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons punished in those days it certainly never\r\nerred on the side of leniency. A Roman Catholic member named Floyd,\r\nwho had made use of insulting expressions with reference to the\r\ndaughter of James I., was found guilty of gross breach of privilege.\r\nHe was sentenced to be degraded, branded, whipped, fined £1000, and to\r\nstand twice in the pillory. After this, whatever was left of him was\r\nto be imprisoned for life. The pillory was evidently a favourite\r\npunishment for recalcitrant members, and as late as 1727 we find a\r\nlegislator named Ward suffering this unpleasant penalty in addition to\r\nexpulsion from the House.[266]\r\n\r\n  [266] Ward was expelled for forgery. He is referred to in Pope's\r\n  \"Dunciad\"--\r\n\r\n    \"As thick as eggs at Ward in pillory.\"--\r\n\r\n                         Book iii. line 34.\r\n\r\nIn James I.'s reign a certain Sir Giles Mompesson, member of\r\nParliament, was accused of \"being a Monopolist.\" For this crime he was\r\nturned out of the House, perpetually outlawed, excepted from all\r\ngeneral pardons, bereft of his goods, imprisoned for life, and, last\r\nof all, sentenced to be \"for ever held an infamous person.\"[267]\r\nAnother member was sent to the Tower for \"speaking out of season,\" an\r\noffence which is fortunately no longer considered particularly\r\nheinous, or perhaps few members would be at liberty to-day.\r\n\r\n  [267] \"Lex Parliamentaria,\" pp. 94, 101.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 Parliament appears to have been especially pitiless,\r\ndispensing fines and imprisonments right and left upon any one who\r\ndispleased it. Sir Edward Dering was impeached for promoting a\r\npetition from the county of Kent, and the petition itself was ordered\r\nto be burnt at the hands of the common hangman. Sir Ralph Hopton was\r\nimprisoned in the Tower for saying in the House that his\r\nfellow-members seemed to ground their views of the King's apostacy\r\nupon evidence insufficient to convict a horse-thief; and a wretched\r\ntradesman named Sandeford, who cursed Parliament and all its works,\r\nwas fined a hundred marks, pilloried, whipped, and sentenced to\r\nlife-long confinement in a House of Correction. So assertive of their\r\npower and so jealous of their privileges were the Commons at this time\r\nthat they even made an order to issue a warrant for the apprehension\r\nof all such persons as one of their members, Sir Walter Erie, should\r\nname.[268]\r\n\r\n  [268] Sir Walter had lodged information of scandalous words spoken by\r\n  certain individuals. See Lister's \"Life of Clarendon,\" vol. iii. p.\r\n  125.\r\n\r\nPeers and prelates were no safer than the humbler members from the\r\nvindictive spirit of Parliament, and any breach of its privileges on\r\ntheir part brought instant punishment. In 1603 the Bishop of Bristol\r\npublished a book which was considered by Parliament to be most\r\noffensive. At a conference of both Houses he was sternly rebuked \"for\r\npresuming to see more than a Parliament could,\" when he at once\r\nrecanted, withdrew his obnoxious presumptions, and declared, \"first,\r\nthat he had erred; secondly, that he was sorry for it; and, thirdly,\r\nthat if it were to do again, he would not do it.\"[269] Only on these\r\nabject terms could he expiate his offence. A hundred years later, in\r\n1712, a volume of sermons written by the Bishop of St. Asaph,\r\ndeploring the terms of the peace with France and Spain, was condemned\r\nto be burnt in Palace Yard.\r\n\r\n  [269] Petyt's \"Miscellanea Parliamentaria,\" p. 64.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant-at-Arms is the official entrusted with the duty of\r\nenforcing the penal decisions of the House of Commons. All warrants\r\nissued by the House are executed by him. He brings witnesses and\r\nculprits to the bar, sees that members and strangers do not infringe\r\nits resolutions, and has the custody of such persons as may be\r\ncommitted to his charge. The doorkeepers, messengers, and police\r\nemployed in the Commons are under his control, as are the buildings\r\nthemselves while Parliament is sitting. As an officer of the Crown, he\r\nmay be summoned to attend upon the sovereign on such occasions as the\r\nopening of Parliament, when the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms takes his\r\nplace as the personal escort of the Speaker. Like his colleagues, the\r\nSergeant used formerly to eke out a precarious living upon fees, and\r\nreceived all or a part of the fines inflicted upon members for absence\r\nor unpunctuality. To-day, however, he enjoys a regular salary, and an\r\nofficial residence.[270]\r\n\r\n  [270] In bygone days his duties evidently entailed much pedestrian\r\n  exercise, as may be gathered from an Order of the House issued in\r\n  Queen Elizabeth's time. \"Upon Motion of the House\" (say the records),\r\n  \"in regard to the Infirmity and Pains in the Sergeant's Feet, he is\r\n  licensed by the House to ride a Footcloth Nag.\" \"Observations, Rules,\r\n  and Orders Collected out of Divers Journals of the House of Commons\"\r\n  (1717), p. 138.\r\n\r\nOnly once since the attempt of Colonel Pride to purge the House have\r\nrepresentatives of the law traversed the bar of the Commons. The\r\nPalace of Westminster, within and without, is guarded by members of\r\nthe Metropolitan Police, but they studiously refrain from trespassing\r\nupon the sacred ground that lies within the bar of either House.\r\nDuring the Speakership of Mr. Gully, however, in 1901, several Irish\r\nmembers declined to leave the House when ordered to do so for a\r\ndivision, and resisted the Sergeant-at-Arms and his myrmidons. Stout\r\npolice-constables were therefore summoned, and bore the unwilling\r\nmembers struggling to the door in that kindly but determined grasp\r\nwhich, as Suffragettes have since learnt by experience, is one of the\r\nchief charms of the A Division.\r\n\r\nThe right of the Houses of Parliament to regulate their own internal\r\nconcerns has always been admitted. In Henry VI.'s reign the Lord Chief\r\nJustice informed the House of Lords that the High Court of Parliament\r\n\"is so high and mighty in its nature that it may make law, and that\r\nthat is law it may make no law, and the determination and knowledge of\r\nthat privilege belongs to the Lords of the Parliament, and not to the\r\nJustices.\"[271] Courts of law have never interfered with anything that\r\ntook place in Parliament unless it were of an essentially criminal\r\ncharacter. Parliament, however, has not always shown the same\r\nconsideration for courts of law. In 1703, a man named Ashby brought an\r\naction against the constables of Aylesbury for refusing to record his\r\nvote at an election. The Commons thereupon declared it a gross breach\r\nof privilege that any court other than themselves should presume to\r\ntry a case that had any reference to an election, and proceeded to\r\ntake into custody everybody concerned in the affair. The Speaker went\r\nin person to the Court of Queen's Bench to summon the Lord Chief\r\nJustice to attend upon the Commons and explain the law's unjustifiable\r\ninterposition. For once, however, the representative of Parliament was\r\nforced to beat an undignified retreat. Old Lord Chief Justice Holt was\r\na quick-tempered man, and not at all awed by the presence of Speaker\r\nSmith. \"If you do not depart from this court,\" he said to him in his\r\nsternest voice, \"I will commit you, though you have the whole House of\r\nCommons in your belly!\"\r\n\r\n  [271] \"Rot. Parl;\" vol. v. 239-240.\r\n\r\nThis was but one example of the numerous collisions between Parliament\r\nand the law, resulting from the former's rigid insistence upon bygone\r\nprivileges, and the difficulty of settling which questions should be\r\nleft to the arbitrament of either authority. If matters were left to\r\nthe decision of the Commons, it is clear that everything would\r\nprobably be brought within the scope of privilege; if to courts of\r\nlaw, all privilege would possibly be abolished. Some thought the\r\nformer alternative was the least to be feared. \"While men are but\r\nmen,\" said Lord Jeffrey, \"we must be at the mercy of a fallible and\r\nirresponsible despotism at best; and if we have to choose, as in an\r\nopen question, few would hesitate to say that they would rather have\r\nthe House of Commons for a despot than the courts of law.\"[272] But\r\nthe matter became ridiculous when Parliament insisted on interfering\r\nin questions which it had clearly no right to decide. In 1721, for\r\ninstance, the House of Commons committed the proprietors of a paper\r\ncalled \"Mist's Journal\" to Newgate for publishing an article favouring\r\nthe restoration of the Pretender. This could scarcely be considered a\r\nbreach of privilege, but the House thought itself empowered to deal\r\nwith all political offenders. Since that time no one has been\r\ncommitted, except for a distinct breach of privilege, or for contempt\r\nof Parliament. The latter term, however, embraces the most trivial\r\noffences. In 1827, a stranger who was visiting the House of Lords left\r\nhis umbrella in the cloak-room, by order of the attendant. On\r\nreturning to claim his property at the end of the sitting, he found\r\nthat his umbrella--following the universal fashion of that elusive\r\narticle--had disappeared. He proceeded to bring an action against the\r\ndoorkeeper, and was awarded damages amounting to £1 0_s._ 4_d._ Lord\r\nChancellor Eldon thereupon summoned him to the bar of the Lords, and\r\nforced him, on pain of imprisonment, to refund the value of his\r\numbrella and apologise. Four years later, the printer of \"The Times\"\r\nwas fined £100 and sent to Newgate for having dared to call the Earl\r\nof Limerick \"a thing with human pretensions.\"\r\n\r\n  [272] Cockburn's \"Life of Jeffrey,\" vol. ii. p. 354.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords has always considered itself empowered to inflict\r\nfines as well as imprisonment for a fixed period. When the Commons\r\nconfine an offender they may put no term to his sentence, and he is\r\nreleased automatically on a prorogation. For the last two hundred\r\nyears they have ceased to exercise the right of fining delinquents,\r\nbut in early days, as we have seen, they often inflicted financial\r\npenalties, and stimulated the attendance of their own members by an\r\ninroad upon their pockets.\r\n\r\nAt the very commencement of parliamentary history the shires or\r\nboroughs whose representatives did not appear in their places in\r\nParliament were fined £100. In 1580, any knight who stayed away for a\r\nwhole session was fined £20, while citizens and burgesses were fined\r\n£10. Besides this, members lost their pay during absence, and, by an\r\nAct of Henry VIII., boroughs and shires were exonerated from the\r\npayment of wages to members who left Parliament before the end of the\r\nsession without the Speaker's permission.\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion peers and bishops were punished for non-attendance,\r\nthe size of their fines varying in proportion to the rank of the\r\noffender. An ordinance framed in Henry VI.'s time, about 1452, imposed\r\nfines of from £40 to £100 upon absentee peers, the sum thus raised to\r\nbe appropriated to the defence of Calais.[273] In 1625 a fine of 5_s._\r\nper day was imposed upon peers who disregarded their summons to\r\nParliament, and we read of the Cinque Ports being mulcted in the sum\r\nof a hundred marks because their baron absented himself.[274] When the\r\nBill for degrading Queen Caroline was before the Lords a fine of £100\r\nwas imposed during the first three days, and £50 for any subsequent\r\nday, on which any peer did not attend, unless he could prove illness\r\nor unavoidable absence. By a former Standing Order, every lord who\r\nentered the House after prayers was fined, if a baron or a bishop,\r\n1_s._; if of higher rank, 2_s._ What a contrast to these degenerate\r\ndays in which the Lord Chancellor, the bishop, and one peer, hunted\r\nup for the purpose, form a reluctant congregation!\r\n\r\n  [273] Nicholas's \"Proceedings of the Privy Council,\" vol. vi. p. lxv.\r\n\r\n  [274] \"Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,\" p. 28.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Charles I. penalties were extremely necessary if the\r\nbusiness of Parliament was to be carried on at all. Members took their\r\nduties lightly, and at times not more than a dozen would appear in\r\ntheir places at Westminster. Prynne describes them as wasting their\r\ntime in taverns, playhouses, dicing-houses, cockpits, and bowling\r\nalleys, \"rambling abroad to such places at unreasonable Hours of the\r\nNight in antique Parliamentary Robes, Vestments fitter for a Mask or\r\nStage than the gravity of a Parliament House.\" They would only come to\r\npeep into the House once or twice a week, he says, to show themselves\r\nin such disguises, and ask, \"What news?\"[275]\r\n\r\n  [275] \"Brief Register of Parliamentary Writs,\" p. 672.\r\n\r\nIn the Parliament which passed the Grand Remonstrance there were\r\nsometimes as many as two hundred absentees. To remedy this evil it was\r\nproposed by Strode that any member who stayed away without leave\r\nshould be fined £50, or expelled. This proposal, says D'Ewes, \"was\r\nmuch debated, but laid aside.\"[276] Even those members who attended\r\ndid so in a casual and perfunctory fashion, which proved a source of\r\ngreat inconvenience to colleagues who took their responsibilities more\r\nseriously. In order, therefore, to enforce punctuality, minor fines\r\nwere inflicted, and in 1628 an order was made that any member who came\r\nin late for prayers must contribute 1_s._ to the poor box. The House\r\nmet at seven or eight o'clock in the morning in those days; members\r\ntherefore had some excuse for arriving late, and the system had to be\r\ntemporarily abandoned in 1641, owing to the interruption of business\r\nresulting from the cries of \"Pay! Pay!\" with which unpunctual persons\r\nwere greeted. \"Scenes\" would often take place when members arrived\r\njust as the clock was striking, and either refused to pay their\r\nshillings, or flung them angrily upon the floor for the Sergeant to\r\npick up. Later on, when the House rose at midday, instead of in the\r\nafternoon, the regulation was revived. Speaker Lenthall himself was\r\nlate on one occasion, much to the delight of the House, and, his\r\nattention being drawn to the fact, threw his shilling down on to the\r\ntable with every sign of annoyance.\r\n\r\n  [276] Forster's \"Grand Remonstrance,\" p. 316 n.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN 1835\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING BY SAMUEL COUSINS FROM THE PAINTING BY H. W.\r\nBURGESS]\r\n\r\nAs late as the middle of the eighteenth century members did not allow\r\ntheir parliamentary duties to interfere with their social pleasures.\r\nBurke once complained because the Commons rose early in order to\r\nattend a _fête-champêtre_ given by Lady Stanley.[277] And in 1751\r\nHorace Walpole told a friend that on the day appointed for the debate\r\non the Naturalization Bill the House \"adjourned to attend Drury\r\nLane.\"[278]\r\n\r\n  [277] Townsend's \"History,\" vol. iii. p. 377.\r\n\r\n  [278] \"Letters,\" March 7, 1731.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time attempts were made to secure the attendance of\r\nmembers by means of a \"call of the House,\" of which due notice was\r\ngiven, members who failed to answer their names being punished. A\r\n\"call\" which was taken in October, 1647, resulted in the discovery\r\nthat one hundred and fifty members were absent, and after a prolonged\r\ndebate it was decided that they should be ordered to pay a fine of £20\r\neach. This system has fallen into disuse, the last \"call\" taking place\r\nin 1836.[279] Five years before this date, however, on March 17, 1831,\r\nthree members, including Lord F. L. Gower, who were not in their\r\nplaces when their names were called, were given into the custody of\r\nthe Sergeant-at-Arms, and compelled to pay fines ranging from £8 to\r\n£10.[280]\r\n\r\n  [279] The last \"call\" of the Lords took place in 1901 on the trial of\r\n  Earl Russell.\r\n\r\n  [280] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 52.\r\n\r\nA member who offends against any of the rules or orders of the House\r\nof Commons may be dealt with in several ways, either by being\r\nsilenced, suspended, expelled, or committed to prison. If any member\r\nindulges in irrelevance or tedious repetition the Speaker can call\r\nupon him to discontinue his speech. Should the offence against order\r\nbe more serious the Speaker may either order the offender to\r\nwithdraw from the House or may \"name\" him, whereupon, on the motion of\r\nthe Leader of the House, he is suspended from its service. The\r\npractice of \"naming\" originated in 1841, when Speaker Lenthall, after\r\ntrying in vain to silence certain noisy members who were chatting\r\ntogether under the gallery, called upon Sir W. Carnabie by name. In\r\nformer days little unpleasantness seems to have attached to the\r\nprocess of \"naming,\" and when Speaker Onslow was asked what the result\r\nwould be of \"naming\" a refractory member he could but answer, \"Heaven\r\nonly knows!\"[281]\r\n\r\n  [281] Fox asked Sir Fletcher Norton the same question. \"What will\r\n  happen?\" replied the Speaker: \"hang me if I either know or care!\"\r\n  \"Life of Sidmouth,\" vol. i. p. 69 n.\r\n\r\nTo-day a Speaker may order any member whose conduct is unruly to\r\nwithdraw from the House for the remainder of the sitting. By a\r\nStanding Order any member wilfully abusing the regulations of the\r\nHouse can be \"named\" by the Chairman or Speaker, and suspended until\r\nthe end of the session, unless the House decides to re-admit him\r\nsooner. When a member is \"named,\" the Sergeant-at-Arms escorts him\r\nfrom the precincts of the chamber, and he is seen off the premises by\r\nthe police. Should he decline to obey the Sergeant's invitation to\r\naccompany him beyond the bar, a couple of elderly attendants step\r\nforward and prepare to expedite his progress towards the door. If\r\nforce has to be used in order to make a member withdraw, his\r\nsuspension lasts unquestionably until the end of the session.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of suspension had not been used for two hundred years\r\nwhen it was revived in 1877. Immediately following the extraordinary\r\nscenes of obstruction which gave rise to Speaker Brand's resolute\r\naction, a wholesale suspension of Irish members took place. On\r\nFebruary 3, 1881, Parnell and more than a score of his colleagues were\r\nnamed and suspended for refusing either to take part in a division or\r\nto withdraw from the House. When the \"closure\" was applied for the\r\nfirst time in February, 1885, a scene of uproar ensued, as a result\r\nof which Mr. O'Brien was suspended, and in March, 1901, as already\r\nmentioned, twelve Irish members who declined to leave their places for\r\na division were forcibly removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms and police,\r\nand subsequently suspended.\r\n\r\nCommittal to the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms is nowadays an\r\nuncommon parliamentary punishment, Bradlaugh being one of the last\r\nmembers to be confined in the Clock Tower.[282] Both Houses, however,\r\nhave the legal right of imprisoning (at Holloway or elsewhere) any\r\nBritish subjects who offend against their privileges.\r\n\r\n  [282] In 1834 Lord Althorp and Sheil were locked up by the\r\n  Sergeant-at-Arms, by order of the Speaker, until they had apologised\r\n  to the House and one another for the use of unparliamentary language.\r\n  Cf. O'Connell's \"Recollections and Experiences,\" vol. i. p. 169.\r\n\r\nExpulsion from the House of Commons is, perhaps, the direst penalty\r\nthat can be inflicted upon a member. In 1714, Lord Cochrane and Steele\r\nthe essayist were both expelled--the one for spreading false reports\r\non the Stock Exchange, the other for publishing \"The Crisis,\" a\r\npamphlet antagonistic in tone to the Government. Some fifty years\r\nlater Wilkes, who had been prosecuted for his articles in the \"North\r\nBriton,\" was also expelled from the House. The voters of Middlesex at\r\nonce re-elected him, but Parliament declared his opponent, the\r\ndefeated candidate, to be duly elected. In 1782, however, the\r\nresolution against Wilkes was erased from the journals of the House.\r\nAt the time of the South Sea Bubble a number of members were turned\r\nout for fraud. Since then, however, the list of expulsions has\r\ndwindled, until to-day such a thing would be considered a rare and\r\nunique occurrence. Though expulsion does not preclude re-election, a\r\ngrave moral stigma attaches to the penalty, and a modern member who\r\nincurred it would find but little consolation in the reflection that\r\nhe shared this invidious distinction with men of no less eminence than\r\nSteele and Walpole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY DRESS AND DEPORTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament to-day differs in very many respects from the Parliaments\r\nof the past; nowhere does that difference express itself more forcibly\r\nthan in the remarkable improvement in parliamentary manners of which\r\nthe last century has been the witness.\r\n\r\nSir John Eliot's well-known words are far more applicable to the\r\nmodern House of Commons than they can ever have been three hundred\r\nyears ago. \"Noe wher more gravitie can be found than is represented in\r\nthat senate,\" he said, speaking of the Chamber of which he was so\r\ndistinguished a member. \"Noe court has more civilitie in itself, nor a\r\nface of more dignitie towards strangers. Noe wher more equall justice\r\ncan be found: nor yet, perhaps, more wisdom.\"[283] It was no doubt a\r\npardonable sense of pride that caused Sir John to take so optimistic a\r\nview of the assembly of his day, for there is ample evidence to show\r\nthat the House of Commons of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nwas not always the grave or civil chamber which he describes. Its\r\npassions were not invariably under control; they flared up into a\r\nblaze on more than one occasion. The appearance of Cardinal Wolsey to\r\ndemand a subsidy for his royal master was the signal for an outburst\r\nof feeling which almost ended in bloodshed; the Long Parliament was in\r\na perpetual state of storm and disorder.\r\n\r\n  [283] Forster's \"Sir John Eliot,\" vol. i. p. 238.\r\n\r\nDuring the Stuart period, and even more so towards the close of the\r\nCommonwealth, the conduct of the Commons was anything but decorous.\r\nThe Speaker of those days frequently found it impossible to maintain\r\norder; the Chair was held in little respect. The behaviour of the\r\nHouse was but little better than that of the Irish Parliament in the\r\ntime of Elizabeth, which spent most of its time in futile argument and\r\ndisagreement: \"The more words, the more choler; and the more speeches,\r\nthe greater broils.\"[284] It was at the commencement of the\r\nseventeenth century that the first violent manifestations of party\r\nfeeling took place which were afterwards destined to cause so many\r\n\"scenes\" in the Commons. Owing to the constant discord prevalent\r\nthere, that House was, by one member, likened to a cockpit; another\r\nwrote to Sir Dudley Carleton that \"many sat there who were more fit to\r\nbe among roaring boys\"; and a third declared his desire to escape, not\r\nonly to the Upper House, but to the upper world altogether.\r\n\r\n  [284] Mountmorris's \"History of the Irish Parliament,\" vol. i. p. 77.\r\n\r\nDuring the lengthy debates on the publication of the Grand\r\nRemonstrance in 1641, feeling ran so high that members would have\r\nsheathed their swords in one another's vitals but for the timely\r\nintervention of Hampden. Even those who did not actively assault each\r\nother seem to have expressed so much malice in their looks as to cause\r\nserious alarm to their opponents. In 1642, for instance, Sir H.\r\nMildmay complained to the House that the member for Coventry \"looked\r\nvery fiercely upon him when he spoke, and that it was done in an\r\nunparliamentary way.\"[285]\r\n\r\n  [285] Palgrave's \"House of Commons,\" p. 18. (The Speaker, however,\r\n  does not appear to have thought it necessary to call upon the member\r\n  for Coventry to withdraw his fierce and unparliamentary expression.)\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles II. riotous debates were of frequent if not\r\ndaily occurrence. When Titus Oates appeared at the bar of the Commons\r\nto accuse Queen Katherine of high treason, partisan excitement reached\r\na dangerous pitch. In 1675, a free fight between Lord Cavendish and\r\nSir John Hanmer was only prevented by the tact of Speaker Seymour,\r\nwho resumed the Chair on his own responsibility--the House was in\r\nCommittee at the time--and managed to quell the disturbance before\r\nblows had been exchanged.\r\n\r\nScenes of a less serious nature took place on many occasions. Andrew\r\nMarvell, the much respected member for Hull, was entering the House of\r\nCommons one morning when he accidentally stumbled against the\r\noutstretched leg of Sir Philip Harcourt. In recovering himself,\r\nMarvell playfully dealt Sir Philip a resounding box on the ear. The\r\nSpeaker at once drew the attention of the House to this affront, and\r\nmembers became greatly excited. When Marvell was at length allowed an\r\nopportunity of speaking, he explained that \"what passed was through\r\ngreat acquaintance and familiarity\" between Sir Philip and himself,\r\nand that his blow was merely a token of deep affection. After a heated\r\ndebate the matter was allowed to drop, though other members of the\r\nHouse must subsequently have fought shy of making friends with a man\r\nwho expressed his liking in so boisterous and painful a fashion.[286]\r\n\r\n  [286] Andrew Marvell's \"Works,\" vol. ii. p. 33. (Sir Philip Harcourt\r\n  might well have anticipated the remark made by the Georgian monarch\r\n  who, while leaning out of a window, received a severe blow from a\r\n  footman who had mistaken the royal back for that of his\r\n  fellow-domestic, James. \"Even if I had been James,\" the King\r\n  plaintively exclaimed, \"you needn't have hit me so hard!\")\r\n\r\nThe fact that many members of both Houses frequently attended the\r\ndebates in an advanced stage of intoxication was, perhaps, the cause\r\nof most of the parliamentary unpleasantness of past days. At\r\nWestminster, indeed, the sobriety of legislators was scarcely more\r\nnoticeable than at Edinburgh, where the Scottish Parliament that met\r\non the Restoration of Charles II. was forced to adjourn, owing to the\r\nfact that the Commissioner Middleton and most of the members were too\r\ndrunk to deliberate.\r\n\r\nInstances of parliamentary intemperance and its natural results were\r\ncommon enough in those days. In 1621, a quarrel arose in the House of\r\nLords between the Earl of Berkshire and Lord Scrope. The former\r\nquickly lost his temper and laid violent hands on his colleague. For\r\nthis he was called to the bar, censured by the Lord Chancellor, and\r\ncommitted to the Tower. Again, at a conference between the two English\r\nHouses, in 1666, the Lords behaved to one another with extreme\r\ndiscourtesy. The Duke of Buckingham opened the proceedings by leaning\r\nacross Lord Dorchester in a rude and offensive manner. The latter\r\ngently but firmly removed the intruding elbow, and on being asked if\r\nhe were uncomfortable, replied that he certainly was, and that nowhere\r\nbut in the House of Lords would the Duke dare to behave in so boorish\r\na fashion. Buckingham irrelevantly retorted that he was the better man\r\nof the two, whereupon Dorchester told his noble colleague that he was\r\na liar. The Duke then struck off the other's hat, seized hold of his\r\nperiwig, and began to pull him about the Chamber. At this moment,\r\nluckily, the Lord Chamberlain and several peers interposed, and the\r\ntwo quarrelsome noblemen were sent to the Tower to regain control of\r\ntheir tempers.\r\n\r\nThe Commons meanwhile were behaving in no less reprehensible a manner.\r\n\"Sir Allen Brodricke and Sir Allen Apsly did come drunk the other day\r\ninto the House,\" says Pepys, \"and did both speak for half an hour\r\ntogether, and could not be either laughed, or pulled, or bid to sit\r\ndown.\"[287] Such a state of things was so usual in either House at the\r\ntime as to provoke neither comment nor criticism. The tone of society\r\nmay be gauged from the fact that at the end of the seventeenth century\r\nit was not thought peculiar for a party of Cabinet Ministers,\r\nincluding the Earl of Rochester, then Lord High Treasurer of England,\r\nstripped to their shirts and riotously intoxicated, to climb the\r\nnearest signpost in order to drink the King's health from a suitable\r\npoint of vantage.[288]\r\n\r\n  [287] \"Diary,\" December 19, 1666.\r\n\r\n  [288] Reresby's \"Memoirs,\" p. 231.\r\n\r\nThe usual condition of the Commons during the hearing of election\r\npetitions a hundred years later has been forcibly described by Thomas\r\nTownshend. \"A House of twenty or thirty members,\" he says, \"half\r\nasleep during the examination of witnesses at the bar, the other half\r\nabsent at Arthur's or Almack's, ... returning to vote so intoxicated\r\nthat they could scarcely speak or stand.\" It must, however, be\r\nadmitted that members' frequent potations did not always affect their\r\nutterance. Indeed, they sometimes appear to have had an entirely\r\nopposite result. In 1676, Lord Carnarvon, under the influence of wine,\r\nmade a remarkably humorous and able speech in the House of Lords,\r\ncausing the Duke of Buckingham to exclaim, \"The man is inspired, and\r\nclaret has done the business!\" Charles Townshend, too, whom Burke\r\ncalled the delight and ornament of the House, and who was offered the\r\nChancellorship of the Exchequer by Pitt, seems to have been far more\r\neloquent in his cups than at any other time. He is chiefly famous for\r\nmaking what is known as the \"Champagne Speech\" of May 12th, 1767--a\r\nspeech which, as Walpole declared to a friend, nobody but Townshend\r\ncould have made, and nobody but he would have made if he could. It was\r\nat once a proof that his abilities were superior to those of all men,\r\nand his judgment below that of any man. It showed him capable of\r\nbeing, and unfit to be, Prime Minister. \"He beat Chatham in language,\r\nBurke in metaphors, Grenville in presumption, Rigby in impudence,\r\nhimself in folly, and everybody in good humour.\"[289] Half a bottle of\r\nchampagne, as Walpole said, poured on genuine genius, had kindled this\r\nwonderful blaze.\r\n\r\n  [289] \"Extracts of the Journals and Correspondence of Miss Berry,\"\r\n  vol. ii. p. 35.\r\n\r\nPitt, as is well known, possessed a marvellously strong head. He and\r\nDundas one evening finished seven bottles without the slightest\r\ndifficulty, and he would often fortify himself with whole tumblers of\r\nhis favourite wine before going down to Westminster.[290]\r\n\r\n  [290] Samuel Rogers' \"Recollections,\" p. 112.\r\n\r\nIt was during the famous debate of February 21, 1783, when Fox was\r\ndefending the Peace of Paris, that Pitt retired behind the Speaker's\r\nChair to be actively unwell, at the same time keeping his hand up to\r\nhis ear that he might miss none of his rival's points. His conduct on\r\nthis occasion affected one of the sensitive clerks at the Table with a\r\nviolent attack of neuralgia--a providential division of labour, as\r\nPitt pointed out, whereby he himself had enjoyed the wine while the\r\nclerk had the headache! It has often been considered surprising that\r\nPitt should have been able to exercise such influence on the House\r\nafter drinking three bottles of strong port, but, as a distinguished\r\nstatesman has observed, it must be remembered that he was addressing\r\nan assembly few of whose members had drunk less than two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY BROUGHAM\r\n\r\nQUEEN CAROLINE'S ATTORNEY-GENERAL, AFTERWARDS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF\r\nGREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n_From the painting by James Lonsdale in the National Portrait\r\nGallery_]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the nineteenth century, when Abbot was in the\r\nChair, the member for Southampton, Fuller by name, entered the House\r\nin a hazy but happy frame of mind, which induced him to mistake the\r\nSpeaker in his wig for an owl in an ivy bush. He was promptly removed\r\nby the Sergeant-at-Arms, and kept in custody until his eyesight had\r\nresumed its normal condition.[291] Another member, Sir George Rose,\r\narrived at Westminster in a condition which inspired him to call upon\r\nthe Speaker for a comic song, and led to his being taken in charge by\r\nthe Sergeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\n  [291] Townsend's \"History,\" vol. ii. p. 93.\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Brougham used to refresh himself copiously while upon\r\nthe Woolsack, and, during his four-hour speech on the Reform Bill,\r\ndrank no less than five tumblers of mulled port and brandy.[292] There\r\nwas, therefore, perhaps some reason for his extreme indignation when\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham referred to the possibility of disturbing him\r\nin the midst of his \"potations pottle deep\"--a quotation which\r\nBrougham did not recognize, and which evoked from him a violent\r\noutburst.[293]\r\n\r\n  [292] Campbell's \"Lives of the Chancellors.\"\r\n\r\n  [293] Grant's \"Recollections of the House of Lords\" (1834). (This is\r\n  not the only instance of a well-known quotation passing unrecognized\r\n  in Parliament. In 1853, when Bishop Wilberforce made a good-humoured\r\n  attack on Lord Derby, the latter remarked that a man might \"smile and\r\n  smile and be a villain,\" and thereby caused much excitement among the\r\n  Lords, who had not recently studied their \"Hamlet.\")\r\n\r\nPeers and members of Parliament to-day have no such weaknesses, or, at\r\nany rate, refrain from exhibiting them in Parliament. There have been,\r\nof course, exceptional instances, even in modern times, of persons\r\nspeaking under the influence of drink, but these are so rare as\r\nscarcely to deserve mention. An Irishman in a conspicuously genial\r\nframe of mind referred to a Conservative member in the lobby as a\r\n\"d---- fool.\" The latter overheard this remark and contemptuously\r\nretorted that his honourable friend was drunk. \"I may be drunk,\"\r\nadmitted the Irishman, \"but to-morrow I shall be sober. Whereas you'll\r\nbe a d---- fool to-morrow, and the next day, and all the rest of your\r\nlife!\" During one of those interminable sittings of 1877, when\r\nobstruction was at its height, another Irishman, \"weary with watching,\r\nand warm with whisky,\" applied the same opprobrious term to a fellow\r\nmember. On being ordered to withdraw the expression he explained that\r\nit \"was only a quotation.\" \"Whether the remark of the hon. gentleman\r\ncan be explained by a quotation or a potation,\" said the Chairman, \"it\r\nis equally inadmissible, and I must beg him in future to mind his p's\r\nand q's.\"[294]\r\n\r\n  [294] \"Quarterly Review,\" vol. cxlv. p. 247.\r\n\r\nIrish members have probably been the cause of more parliamentary\r\ndisturbance than all the rest of their colleagues put together. Daniel\r\nO'Connell, whom Disraeli once called \"the vagabond delegate of a\r\nforeign priesthood,\"[295] was a perpetual source of trouble to the\r\nHouse. In 1840, he was the centre of one of the most noisy scenes that\r\nhas ever outraged its dignity. Macaulay declared that he had never\r\nbefore or since seen such unseemly behaviour, or heard such scurrilous\r\nlanguage used in Parliament. Members on both sides of the House stood\r\nup and shouted at the tops of their voices, shaking their fists in one\r\nanother's faces.[296] Lord Norreys and Lord Maidstone particularly\r\ndistinguished themselves by the pandemonium they created, while others\r\nof their colleagues gave farmyard imitations, and for a long time the\r\nwhole House continued in a state of ferment. O'Connell's reference to\r\nthe sounds emitted by honourable gentlemen as \"beastly bellowings\"\r\nonly made matters worse. As a French visitor who was present during\r\nthis scene has described: \"Pendant plusieures heures plus de cinq\r\ncents membres crient de toutes leurs forces 'à l'ordre! à la porte\r\nO'Connell!' le tout accompagné des imitations zoologiques les plus\r\nétranges et les plus affreuses. C'étaient les cris de deux armées de\r\nsauvages en presence.\"[297]\r\n\r\n  [295] \"Letters of Runnymede,\" p. 6.\r\n\r\n  [296] Trevelyan's \"Life of Macaulay,\" vol. ii. p. 76.\r\n\r\n  [297] \"La France et L'Angleterre,\" par F. de Tassies. (Quoted in\r\n  O'Connell's \"Recollections,\" vol. i. p. 261.)\r\n\r\n\"Imitations zoologiques\" have always been a popular but by no means\r\nthe only method employed by members desirous of drowning the words of\r\na tiresome speaker. John Rolle, the hero of the \"Rolliad,\" promoted a\r\n\"smoking and spitting party \"to interrupt and annoy Burke.[298] In\r\n1784, the latter told a number of youthful opponents who interrupted\r\nhim with their howls that he could teach a pack of hounds to yelp with\r\nmore melody and equal comprehension. Ten years before the O'Connell\r\nscene Brougham excited the House to uproar of a similarly puerile\r\ncharacter. He remained calm and unmoved, however, and, when the\r\nbestial cries of his audience subsided for a moment, pleasantly\r\nobserved that by a wonderful disposition of nature every animal had\r\nits peculiar mode of expressing itself, and that he was too much of a\r\nphilosopher to quarrel with any of those modes--a remark which does\r\nnot appear to have subdued the clamour to any appreciable extent.[299]\r\nA similar uproar which the Speaker was powerless to quell arose in\r\n1872, when Sir Charles Dilke brought forward a motion to inquire into\r\nthe manner in which the income and allowances of the Crown were spent.\r\n\r\n  [298] Thomas Moore's \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii. p. 296.\r\n\r\n  [299] Miss Martineau's \"History of the Peace,\" vol. ii. p. 381.\r\n\r\nMembers who are anxious to bring a debate to a close still have\r\nrecourse to sound, crying, \"'Vide! 'Vide!\" in an earsplitting\r\nfashion, which occasionally evokes a rebuke from the Speaker. But\r\nthere is seldom, nowadays, such a scene of violence as occurred in\r\nboth Houses upon the dissolution of Parliament in April, 1831. The\r\nCommons indulged in a painful scene \"of bellowing, and roaring, and\r\ngnashing of teeth, which it was almost frightful to look at,\" says\r\nCockburn.[300] In the Upper House peers behaved no less childishly.\r\nLord Mansfield doubled up his fist, elbowed Lord Shaftesbury into the\r\nChair, and hooted Lord Brougham as he left the House.[301] Lord\r\nLyndhurst, meanwhile, was threatening the Duke of Richmond with\r\nphysical violence, and the uproar was only quelled by the arrival of\r\nthe King.[302] One must not, of course, forget the notorious modern\r\ninstance of ill manners, already described,[303] when, in 1893,\r\nmembers exchanged blows upon the floor of the Commons. This, however,\r\nis a painful exception, little likely to recur.\r\n\r\n  [300] Cockburn's \"Life of Jeffrey,\" vol. i. p. 317.\r\n\r\n  [301] Duncombe's \"Life of his Father,\" vol. i. p. 115.\r\n\r\n  [302] Brougham's \"Life,\" vol. iii. p. 117.\r\n\r\n  [303] Supra, p. 131.\r\n\r\nPoliticians have learnt to control their feelings, and the present\r\npublicity of parliamentary proceedings acts as a salutary deterrent to\r\noutbursts of the elemental passions. Neither House to-day would dream\r\nof expressing its emotion in the open fashion common to Parliaments of\r\nlong ago. The sight of a Lower Chamber dissolved in tears is no longer\r\npossible. Yet, in 1626, when, by the King's command, no discussion was\r\npermitted on the question of Buckingham's impeachment, a lachrymose\r\nSpeaker led the whole House of Commons in a chorus of weeping. Two\r\nyears later Sir Edward Coke welcomed the introduction of the Petition\r\nof Right in a voice choked with sobs. Wingfield wept for joy when\r\nmonopolies were abolished in Queen Elizabeth's reign,[304] and we have\r\nalready noted the tears shed by Colonel Wanklyn when he was expelled,\r\nand by Speaker Finch when he was forcibly detained in the Chair. Fox\r\nshed frequent tears in the House of Commons; Pitt wept bitterly when\r\nhis friend, Lord Melville, was impeached. Lord Chancellors, too, were\r\nnot ashamed to express their feelings in loud sobs, Eldon's eyes\r\nbecoming sympathetically moist, while even the \"rugged Thurlow\"\r\nsprinkled the Woolsack with his tears.\r\n\r\n  [304] Townshend's \"Proceedings of Both Houses,\" p. 252.\r\n\r\nMembers no longer weep, except perchance in the privacy of their own\r\nhomes; nor do they follow their predecessors' fashion of converting\r\nthe House of Commons into a smoking-room or a lounge, in which to\r\nsleep off the effects of their potations. The free and easy habits of\r\nseventeenth-century politicians made it necessary for a regulation to\r\nbe framed that \"No tobacco should be taken by any member in the\r\ngallery, nor at the table sitting in Committees.\"[305] And it was no\r\nuncommon sight, a hundred years ago, to see members stretched at full\r\nlength on the benches of the Chamber, with their feet resting on the\r\nbacks of the seats in front of them, punctuating the proceedings with\r\ntheir stertorous snores.[306]\r\n\r\n  [305] Regulations in the Journals, March 23, 1693.\r\n\r\n  [306] \"L'lllustre enceinte présente souvent l'aspect d'une assemblée\r\n  de _yankees_ beaucoup plus que celui d'une réunion de _gentlemen_.\"\r\n  Franqueville's \"Le Gouvernement et le Parlement britaniques,\" vol.\r\n  iii. p. 74.\r\n\r\nLord North was notorious for his gift of somnolence in the House of\r\nCommons. \"Behold,\" said Edmund Burke, with that indifferent taste for\r\nwhich he was noted, as he pointed to the recumbent figure of the Prime\r\nMinister, \"the Government, if not defunct, at least nods; brother\r\nLazarus is not dead, but sleepeth.\" North was dozing on another\r\noccasion when a member attacked him fiercely, saying that he ought\r\ncertainly to be impeached for his misdeeds. \"At least,\" exclaimed the\r\nMinister, waking for a moment, \"allow me the criminal's usual\r\nprivilege--a night of rest before the execution!\"[307] He felt no\r\nshame at giving way to slumber in debate, and when an opponent\r\nremarked that \"Even in the midst of these perils, the noble lord is\r\nasleep!\" \"I wish to God I was!\" he replied with heartfelt\r\nfervour.[308] He would always take the opportunity afforded by a\r\nlengthy speech to snatch forty winks. Once, when the long-winded\r\nColonel Barré was addressing the House on the naval history of\r\nEngland, tracing it back to the earliest ages, North asked a friend to\r\nwake him up as soon as the speaker approached modern times. When at\r\nlength he was aroused, \"Where are we?\" asked the Premier, anxiously.\r\n\"At the battle of La Hogue, my lord.\" \"Oh, my dear friend,\" said\r\nNorth, \"you've woken me a century too soon!\"[309]\r\n\r\n  [307] Timbs' \"Anecdotal Biography,\" vol. i. p. 234.\r\n\r\n  [308] Pryme's \"Recollections,\" p. 114.\r\n\r\n  [309] Harford's \"Recollections of Wilberforce,\" p. 94.\r\n\r\nA marked improvement in the conduct of modern debate is to be noticed\r\nin the comparatively inoffensive character of the epithets used by\r\nmembers with reference to their opponents. The decencies of debate\r\nare, as a rule, religiously observed. Recriminations are rare.\r\nMeasures are attacked, not men. The secession of a statesman is\r\nconsidered a political but not a personal offence, and what Palmerston\r\nonce called the \"puerile vanity of consistency\" is no longer\r\nworshipped fanatically. Gladstone rightly called the House of Commons\r\na \"school of temper,\" as well as a school of honour and of justice.\r\nOffensive allusions have always been deprecated there, but it is only\r\nwithin the last few score years that members have controlled their\r\ntongues to any appreciable extent in this direction. Hasty remarks are\r\nnowadays withdrawn at the first suggestion of the Speaker, though on\r\noccasion an apology may be as offensive as the original insult. Lord\r\nRobert Cecil (afterwards Lord Salisbury) said of a speech of\r\nGladstone's in 1861, that it was \"worthy of a pettifogging attorney.\"\r\nSoon afterwards he rose in the House, and said that he wished to\r\napologise for a remark he had lately made. \"I observed that the speech\r\nof the right hon. gentleman was worthy of a pettifogging attorney,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and I now hasten to offer my apologies--to the attornies!\"\r\n\r\nIt is usual nowadays to wrap up offensive criticisms in a more or less\r\npalatable covering, to attack by inference rather than by direct\r\nassault. \"I am no party man,\" said Colonel Sibthorpe, member for\r\nLincoln, after the dissolution of Sir Robert Peel's Government. \"I\r\nhave never acted from party feelings; but I must say I do not like the\r\ncountenances of honourable gentlemen opposite, for I believe them to\r\nbe the index of their minds. I can only say, in conclusion, that I\r\nearnestly hope that God will grant the country a speedy deliverance\r\nfrom such a band.\"[310] This is a good example of an unpleasant thing\r\nframed in a manner which does not lay it open to the stigma of\r\ndisorderly language, and is just as effective as that oft-quoted\r\nattack made by a member of the Irish House of Commons on George\r\nPonsonby (afterwards Irish Chancellor), whose sister was sitting in\r\nthe gallery at the time. \"These Ponsonbys are the curse of my\r\ncountry,\" said the member; \"they are prostitutes, personally and\r\npolitically--from the toothless old hag who is now grinning in the\r\ngallery to the white-livered scoundrel who is now shivering on the\r\nfloor!\"[311]\r\n\r\n  [310] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 140.\r\n\r\n  [311] Hayward's \"Essays,\" pp. 364-5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN WALPOLE'S DAY\r\n\r\nFROM THE ENGRAVING BY A.

(CLERK OF HOUSE OF COMMOMS),\r\nSIR JAMES THORNHILL, MR. AISKEW (CLERK ASSISTANT)]\r\n\r\nMembers who consider themselves aggrieved or insulted have now no\r\nredress save by an appeal to the Speaker. In old days they often took\r\nthe matter into their own hands, and many a duel was the outcome of\r\nhasty words spoken in Parliament. So prevalent, indeed, did the habit\r\nof duelling become, that in 1641 a resolution was passed in the\r\nCommons empowering the Speaker to arrest any member who either sent or\r\nreceived a challenge. The practice of parliamentary duelling long\r\ncontinued, in spite of every effort to stifle it. Wilkes was wounded\r\nin 1763 in Hyde Park by a member named Martin, who had called him \"a\r\ncowardly scoundrel.\" Lord Castlereagh and Canning met in 1809, and\r\nhad, in consequence, to resign their seats in the Cabinet.[312] Lord\r\nAlvanley fought Morgan O'Connell, son of the Liberator, on his\r\nfather's account. Charles James Fox was challenged by Mr. Adam, of the\r\nOrdnance Department, for a personal attack made in the House of\r\nCommons, and faced him in the old Kensington Gravel Pits. At the first\r\nshot Adam's bullet lodged harmlessly in his opponent's belt. \"If\r\nyou hadn't used Ordnance powder,\" said Fox, with a laugh, as he shook\r\nhands with Adam after the fight, \"I should have been a dead man.\"[313]\r\n\r\n  [312] Bell's \"Life of Canning,\" p. 251.\r\n\r\n  [313] Pryme's \"Recollections,\" p. 235.\r\n\r\nIf duels were fought in those days on very slight provocation,\r\nchallenges were also occasionally declined on equally poor grounds.\r\nColonel Luttrell, member for Middlesex, and afterwards Lord\r\nCarhampton, refused to fight his own father, not because he was his\r\nfather, but because he was not a gentleman!\r\n\r\nThe last duel between politicians was that fought by the Duke of\r\nWellington and Lord Winchelsea, as the result of some remarks made by\r\nthe latter during a debate on the Roman Catholic Emancipation Bill in\r\n1830. Since that time no parliamentary dispute has been referred to\r\nthe arbitrament of the pistol.\r\n\r\nAlthough there has been a perceptible improvement in parliamentary\r\ndeportment as the centuries have advanced, the same can scarcely be\r\nsaid of parliamentary dress. In the time of Charles II.,\r\nknee-breeches, silk stockings, and silver-buckled shoes were\r\nabsolutely _de rigueur_ for members of the Commons. A hundred years\r\nlater members of Parliament always wore court dress, with bag-wig and\r\nsword, in the House. The formal costume prescribed by etiquette was\r\nrigidly adhered to, and none but county members were permitted the\r\nprivilege of wearing spurs.[314] At this time, too, Cabinet Ministers\r\nwere never seen in Parliament without the ribbons and decorations of\r\nthe various orders to which they belonged. The regulation which bids\r\nthe mover and seconder of the Address to appear in court dress on the\r\nfirst day of the new Parliament is the only relic of this custom.\r\n\r\n  [314] Lord Colchester's \"Diary,\" vol. i. p. 45.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago no member of either House would have appeared within\r\nthe precincts of the Palace of Westminster wearing anything upon his\r\nhead but a high silk hat. Gradually, however, a certain laxity in the\r\nmatter of head-gear has crept into Parliament, and to-day, not only\r\n\"bowlers,\" but even \"cricketing caps\" may be seen reposing upon the\r\nunabashed heads of members. Peers, as a rule, conform to the older\r\nfashion, and Cabinet Ministers usually dress in a respectably sombre\r\ngarb. But among the rank and file of the House of Commons may\r\noccasionally be found members wearing check suits of the lightest and\r\nloudest patterns, and hats of every conceivable variety, ranging from\r\nthe æsthetic \"Homburg\" to the humble cloth cap. The passing of the top\r\nhat must necessarily appear somewhat in the light of a tragedy to\r\nolder parliamentarians. In both Houses the hat has long come to be\r\nregarded as a sacred symbol. It is with this article of clothing that\r\nthe member daily secures his claim to a seat on the benches of the\r\nHouse of Commons; with a hat he occasionally expresses his enthusiasm\r\nor sympathy; on a hat does he sit at the close of a speech, with the\r\ncertainty of raising a laugh; and without a hat he cannot speak upon a\r\npoint of order when the House has been cleared for a division.\r\n\r\nWhen the Labour Party began to take an important place in the popular\r\nassembly, it was thought that this democratic invasion would have an\r\nactively detrimental effect upon the dress of the House. Old-fashioned\r\nmembers shook their heads and prophesied an influx of hobnailed\r\nartisans, clad in corduroys, their trousers confined at the knee with\r\nstring, and in their mouths a short clay pipe. These gloomy\r\nforebodings have not been realised. With very few exceptions the dress\r\nof Labour members is little calculated to offend the most sensitive\r\neye, though it was certainly one of their number who first entered a\r\nstartled House of Commons in a tweed stalking-cap--a form of\r\nhead-dress which it is certainly difficult to forgive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY ELOQUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt was asked what he considered most to be lamented, the lost\r\nbooks of Livy, or those of Tacitus, he replied that to the recovery of\r\neither of these he would prefer that of a speech by Bolingbroke. Not a\r\nfragment of what Dean Swift called the \"invincible eloquence\" of that\r\nstatesman is left to us. But though we are compelled to take his\r\nreputation as an orator on trust, we should do wrong to complain, for\r\nit is more than probable that a perusal of Bolingbroke's speeches\r\nto-day would prove disappointing.\r\n\r\n\"Words that breathed fire are ashes on the page,\" and the utterances\r\nthat have stirred a thousand hearts in the Senates of old days too\r\noften leave the modern reader cold and unmoved. We miss the\r\ninflections of a magical voice, the stimulating plaudits of friends or\r\nfollowers, the magnetism that can only be communicated by a personal\r\nintercourse between a speaker and his audience. The reading of old\r\nspeeches is, as Lord Rosebery has observed, a dreary and reluctant\r\npilgrimage which few willingly undertake. It supplies, as a rule, but\r\na poor explanation of the effect which the eloquence of past orators\r\nproduced upon their contemporaries. It is like attending an undress\r\nrehearsal of a play in an empty theatre on a cold winter's afternoon.\r\nThe glamour of costume, of limelight, is lacking; the atmosphere of\r\nappreciation, excitement, enthusiasm, is absent. The difference\r\nbetween the spoken and the published oration has been aptly defined as\r\nthe difference between some magnificent temple laid open to the\r\nstudious contemplation of a solitary visitant, and the same edifice\r\nbeheld amidst the fullest accompaniments of sacrificial movement and\r\nsplendour, thronged with adoring crowds, and resounding with solemn\r\nharmonies.[315]\r\n\r\n  [315] \"Quarterly Review,\" vol. xxii. p. 496.\r\n\r\nIt has often been affirmed that no speech in Parliament has ever\r\nresulted in the winning of a division. Byron declared that \"not Cicero\r\nhimself, nor probably the Messiah, could have altered the vote of a\r\nsingle lord of the Bedchamber or Bishop.\"[316] There are, however, one\r\nor two instances of orations which have been so moving in their appeal\r\nthat they may claim to be exceptions to this rule. Plunket's famous\r\nspeech in the debate on Grattan's motion for Catholic Emancipation in\r\n1807 is said to have gained many votes. Macaulay won the support of\r\nseveral opponents by an eloquent speech on the second reading of Lord\r\nMahon's Copyright Bill in 1842, and, on a Bill introduced by Lord\r\nHotham to exclude certain persons holding offices from the House of\r\nCommons, actually caused the anticipated majority to be reversed.\r\n\r\n  [316] Moore's \"Life of Byron,\" 185.\r\n\r\nOn one memorable occasion when Sheridan, with that impassioned oratory\r\nfor which he had already become famous, was advocating the prosecution\r\nof Warren Hastings, the House of Commons was so stirred that a motion\r\nfor adjournment was made in order to give members time to recover from\r\nthe overpowering effect of his eloquence.[317] Again, during the\r\ndebate on Commercial Distress in December, 1847, Peel roused the fury\r\nof the Protectionists by a violent and able speech, and, when he\r\nresumed his seat, an adjournment was moved on the ground that the\r\nHouse was not in a condition to vote dispassionately. Burke, too,\r\nseems at times to have stimulated his hearers to an active expression\r\nof their emotion; and when he was lamenting the employment of Indians\r\nin the American War, a fellow-member was so moved that he offered to\r\nnail a copy of his speech upon the door of every church in the\r\nkingdom.[318]\r\n\r\n  [317] Barnes' \"Reminiscences,\" p. 203.\r\n\r\n  [318] Prior's \"Life of Burke,\" vol. i. p. 337.\r\n\r\nYet the speeches of Burke and Sheridan do not affect us to-day with\r\nanything but a mild enthusiasm, chiefly founded upon our admiration of\r\ntheir literary excellence. We remain comparatively indifferent to\r\ntheir appeal; our hearts beat no faster as we read.\r\n\r\nSheridan's two orations on the subject of Warren Hastings'\r\nimpeachment--the one delivered in the House of Commons on February 7,\r\n1787, and the other in Westminster Hall during the trial--have been\r\nconsidered among the very finest ever made in Parliament. It was after\r\nthe first of these, which lasted for five hours, that the House\r\nadjourned to enable members to survey the question calmly, freed from\r\nthe spell of the enchanter. Sheridan's style, according to Burke, was\r\n\"something between poetry and prose, and better than either.\"[319]\r\nEven the fastidious Byron declared him to be the only speaker he ever\r\nwished to hear at greater length. He was offered £1000 by a publisher\r\nfor his great \"Begum Speech,\" if he would but consent to correct the\r\nproofs; but for long he refused. Eventually he agreed to its\r\npublication, but by that time popular interest had subsided.[320] As\r\nmuch as fifty guineas was paid for a seat to hear his speech at the\r\ntrial of Hastings, when, as Ben Jonson wrote of Bacon, \"the fear of\r\nevery man that heard him was lest he should make an end.\"[321]\r\n\r\n  [319] Moore's \"Life of Sheridan,\" vol. i. p. 523.\r\n\r\n  [320] He never received the promised £1000. (See Harrington's\r\n  \"Personal Sketches of His Own Times,\" vol. i. p. 429.)\r\n\r\n  [321] \"Cornwallis Papers,\" vol. i. p. 364 n.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Burke, whom Macaulay has described as the greatest man\r\nsince Milton, are perhaps the most suitable for perusal of any ever\r\ndelivered in Parliament. They read better than they sounded as\r\ndelivered; they are rather pamphlets than orations. Burke himself was\r\ndeficient in many of the qualities of an orator. His voice was harsh\r\nand his gestures ungainly. He never consulted the prejudices of his\r\naudience. His lapses from good taste were frequent, and among his most\r\nsplendid passages may be found occasional coarse and vulgar epithets\r\nand expressions. Yet so great was his eloquence, so marvellous his\r\noratorical powers, that Byron has included him with Pitt and Fox among\r\nthe \"wondrous three whose words were sparks of immortality.\" And the\r\nflorid Dr. Parr can scarcely find words sufficiently eulogistic to\r\nsing his praises.[322]\r\n\r\n  [322] \"Burke ... By whose sweetness Athens herself would have been\r\n  soothed, with whose amplitude and exuberance she would have been\r\n  enraptured, and on whose lips that prolific mother of genius and\r\n  science would have adored, confessed, the Goddess of Persuasion.\"\r\n  Prior's \"Burke,\" p. 484.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDMUND BURKE\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING BY J. WATSON AFTER THE PAINTING BY SIR J. REYNOLDS]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century parliamentary attendance and eloquence were\r\nequally poor. Not only did many members speak indifferently; at times\r\nthere would be long intervals of silence when members did not speak at\r\nall. \"A pause for two or three minutes,\" ... \"The House sat looking at\r\neach other,\"[323] are some of the entries in the reports which must\r\nstrike the modern mind, accustomed to the present House of Commons, as\r\npeculiar. Steele described the House of his day as being composed of\r\nsilent people oppressed by the choice of a great deal to say, and of\r\neloquent people ignorant that what they said was nothing to the\r\npurpose.[324]\r\n\r\n  [323] Townsend's \"History of the House of Commons,\" vol. ii. p. 427.\r\n\r\n  [324] Forster's \"Biographical Essays,\" vol. ii. p. 197.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Georgian age that parliamentary oratory reached\r\nits heyday. Then, too, speeches began to lengthen, and by the time\r\nLord North became Prime Minister it was not unusual for a member to\r\naddress the House for two or three hours on end. Lord Brougham once\r\nspoke for six hours on the amendment of the law. Even in Walpole's day\r\noccasional prolixity was not unknown. One Hutcheson, member for\r\nHastings, when the Septennial Bill of 1716 was under discussion, made\r\na speech of which the summary fills more than twenty-five pages of the\r\nParliamentary History.[325] Again, when David Hartley, a notorious\r\nbore, rose to speak one day, Walpole went home, changed his clothes,\r\nrode to Hampstead, returned, changed once more, and came back to\r\nthe House to find this tiresome member still upon his legs.[326]\r\n\r\n  [325] Vol. vii. pp. 339-367.\r\n\r\n  [326] Pryme's \"Recollections,\" p. 218 n.\r\n\r\nChatham was the first statesman to make a habit of delivering long\r\nspeeches. The practice was never popular, and has now fallen into\r\ndesuetude. The rising to his feet of a tedious member has ever been\r\nthe signal for the House to clear as though by magic. Sergeant Hewitt,\r\nmember for Coventry in 1761, was a well-known parliamentary emetic.\r\n\"Is the House up?\" asked a friend of Charles Townshend, seeing the\r\nlatter leaving St. Stephen's Chapel. \"No,\" replied Townshend, \"but\r\nHewitt is!\"[327] The departure of his audience is, however, a hint to\r\nwhich the habitual bore is generally impervious. A dull and lengthy\r\nspeaker, addressing empty benches in the House of Commons, whispered\r\nto a friend that the absence of members did not affect him, as he was\r\nspeaking to posterity. \"If you go on at this rate,\" was the unkind\r\nreply, \"you'll see your audience before you!\"[328]\r\n\r\n  [327] O'Flanaghan's \"Lives of the Irish Chancellors,\" vol. ii. p. 128.\r\n\r\n  [328] Townsend's \"House of Commons,\" vol. ii. p. 394.\r\n\r\nWhen Gladstone brought in his first Budget in 1853 he spoke for five\r\nhours. He had been advised by Sir Robert Peel to be long and diffuse,\r\nrather than short and concise, seeing that the House of Commons was\r\ncomposed of men of such various ways of thinking, and it was important\r\nto put his case from many different points of view so as to appeal to\r\nthe idiosyncrasies of each.[329] In the days of his Premiership,\r\nhowever, Gladstone's speeches were considerably shortened, and even\r\nthe introduction of so momentous and intricate a measure as the Home\r\nRule Bill of 1886 was accomplished in three and a half hours. Lengthy\r\nspeeches are no longer fashionable, though Mr. Biggar spoke for four\r\nhours on a famous occasion in 1890, and Mr. Lloyd George occupied the\r\nsame time in unfolding the much-discussed Finance Bill of 1909.\r\n\r\n  [329] Morley's \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. i. p. 143.\r\n\r\nThough the oratorical masterpieces of the past may, for the most part,\r\nbe dull reading, to the student or historian they must always prove\r\ninteresting and instructive, as revealing those peculiar qualities\r\nwhich appeal to a parliamentary audience. They explain to a certain\r\nextent what it is that a speech must possess in order to meet with the\r\napproval of either House.\r\n\r\nParliament--and more especially the House of Commons--is no very\r\nlenient critic; but it is a sound one. It pardons the faults of style\r\nor manner due to inexperience; it tolerates homeliness that is the\r\noutcome of sincerity. It has a keen eye for motives, and anything\r\npretentious or dishonest is an abomination to it. Matter is of far\r\ngreater importance than manner, and Parliament agrees with Sir Thomas\r\nMore that whereas \"much folly is uttered with pointed polished speech,\r\nso many, boisterous and rude in language, see deep indeed, and give\r\nright substantial counsel.\"[330] Sincerity, in fact, has far more\r\ninfluence in the House of Commons than either brilliancy or wit, and\r\nany attempt at platform heroics is certain to fail. There is nothing\r\nthe House is so fond of, Sheil used to say, as facts.[331] There is\r\nnothing it so much resents, we might now add, as violations of good\r\ntaste. This fastidiousness is no doubt of modern growth, for we find\r\nBurke's coarseness readily condoned, and Sheil himself lapsing into\r\noccasional vulgarity.[332]\r\n\r\n  [330] Roper's \"Life of More,\" p. 16.\r\n\r\n  [331] MacCullagh's \"Memoirs of Sheil,\" vol. ii. p. 99.\r\n\r\n  [332] Speaking on Church reform, Sheil once said that when this was\r\n  effected, \"the bloated paunch of the unwieldy rector would no longer\r\n  heave in holy magnitude beside the shrinking abdomen of the starving\r\n  and miserably prolific curate.\" Francis's \"Orators,\" p. 274.\r\n\r\nLike all assemblies of human beings, Parliament has always welcomed an\r\nopportunity for laughter. In the House of Commons the poorest joke\r\ncreates amusement; the man who sits upon his hat at once becomes a\r\npopular favourite; a \"bull\" is ever acceptable. When Sheridan, in\r\n1840, attacked another member, saying, \"There he stands, Mr. Speaker,\r\nlike a crocodile, with his hands in his pockets, shedding false\r\ntears!\" the House rocked with laughter.[333] Yet the phrase did not\r\noriginate with Sheridan, but was one of the many \"bulls\" that had been\r\ncoined by that prince of bull-makers, Sir Boyle Roche. It was Roche\r\nwho declared that he could not be in two places at once \"like a bird\";\r\nwho attempted to \"shunt a question by a side-wind\"; and announced that\r\nhe was prepared to sacrifice not merely a part but the whole of the\r\nConstitution to preserve the remainder! \"What, Mr. Speaker!\" he\r\ninquired on a famous occasion in the Irish House of Commons, \"are we\r\nto beggar ourselves for fear of vexing posterity? Now, I would ask the\r\nhonourable gentleman, and this _still more_ honourable House, why we\r\nshould put ourselves out of our way to do anything for _posterity_;\r\nfor what has posterity done for us?\"[334]\r\n\r\n  [333] Raikes's \"Journal,\" vol. ii. p. 256.\r\n\r\n  [334] Barrington's \"Personal Sketches,\" vol. i. p. 213. (Curran once\r\n  made a happy retort to Roche. \"Do not speak of my honour,\" said the\r\n  latter, \"I am the guardian of my own honour.\" \"Faith!\" answered\r\n  Curran, \"I knew that at some time or other you would accept a\r\n  sinecure.\" Philips's \"Life of Curran,\" p. 59.)\r\n\r\n\"The House loves good sense and joking, and nothing else,\" said Sir T.\r\nF. Buxton, in 1819; \"and the object of its utter aversion is that\r\nspecies of eloquence which may be called Philippian.\"[335]\r\nSentimentality of any kind is rarely tolerated in Parliament, as may\r\nbe seen by the indifference with which Burke's dagger and Lord\r\nBrougham's melodramatic prayer were greeted. When Bright, during the\r\nCrimean War, delivered himself of that famous phrase, \"The Angel of\r\nDeath has been abroad throughout the land; you may almost hear the\r\nbeating of its wings!\" it was a question as to how members would take\r\nso sentimental a simile. Had the speaker substituted the word\r\n\"flapping\" for \"beating,\" as Cobden afterwards observed to him, they\r\nwould have roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n  [335] \"Memoirs,\" p. 89.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, as a writer has remarked, is a body without any\r\nprinciples or prejudices, except against bores. \"He who comes to it\r\nwith a good reputation has no better chance than he who besieges it\r\nwith a bad one. It rejects all pretensions it has not of itself\r\njustified, and all fame it has not itself conferred.\"[336] It has,\r\nindeed, always been remarkable for a great reluctance in confirming\r\nreputations for oratory gained elsewhere. Wilkes could sway the\r\npopulace with his grandiloquent declamations, but failed ignominiously\r\nin Parliament; Kenealy was refused a hearing. The chastening effect of\r\nthe Lower House is notorious, and many a conceited, self-opiniated\r\nindividual has found his level after a brief course of subjection to\r\nwhat Sir James Mackintosh called the \"curry-comb of the House of\r\nCommons.\"[337]\r\n\r\n  [336] Whitty's \"History of the Session\" (1852-3), p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [337] \"Journal,\" vol. i. p. 342.\r\n\r\nBesides bores and demagogues, of which it is justly intolerant, the\r\nHouse of Commons may at one time be said to have numbered lawyers\r\namong its pet aversions. The latter are apt to lecture their\r\nfellow-members as though they were addressing a jury, explaining the\r\nmost patent facts, and generally assuming a didactic air which the\r\nHouse finds it difficult to brook.[338] This perhaps explains the\r\nfailure of such distinguished men as Lord Jeffrey and Sir James\r\nMackintosh, both eloquent lawyers who made little or no mark in\r\nParliament, and of many other \"gentlemen of the long robe,\" as\r\nDisraeli contemptuously called them.\r\n\r\n  [338] \"Accustomed in their courts to consider every matter of equal\r\n  importance,\" says Barnes, \"they adopt the same earnest and stiff\r\n  solemnity of manner, whether they are disputing about violated\r\n  morality or insulted liberty, or about a petty affray where a hat,\r\n  value one shilling, has been torn in a scuffle.\" \"Parliamentary\r\n  Sketches,\" p. 79.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in Parliament is indeed a matter very different to addressing\r\nan audience in the country, on the hustings, or in some local town\r\nhall. The platitudes that evoke such enthusiasm when delivered from a\r\nvillage platform fall very flat in either House. The chilling\r\natmosphere and sparse attendance of the Lords is not conducive to\r\nfeelings of self-confidence: the critical gaze of fellow-members in\r\nthe Commons is little calculated to alleviate a sudden paroxysm of\r\nshyness.\r\n\r\nThe unknown parliamentary speaker is greeted with a respectful but\r\nominous silence when he rises to his feet. He misses the applause of\r\nelectors or tenantry to which he is accustomed in his constituency or\r\non his estate. He has no table on which to place his sheaf of notes;\r\nthere is no water-bottle at hand to moisten his parched lips or give\r\nhim a moment's pause when the stream of his eloquence runs temporarily\r\ndry. He cannot choose the best moment for delivering his speech, but\r\nmust be content to take such opportunities as are afforded by\r\ncircumstances. In the House of Commons a member may have waited half\r\nthe night to catch the elusive eye of the Speaker--though a man who\r\nwishes to make his maiden speech is usually accorded this\r\nprivilege--and, by the time his turn comes, most of his choicest and\r\nbrightest thoughts have already been anticipated by former speakers.\r\nIt is not, therefore, to be wondered at that many men find themselves\r\nunequal to the task of passing successfully through this ordeal, and\r\nthat the maiden speech of a future statesman has often proved a\r\ncomplete fiasco.\r\n\r\nIn 1601, we read of a Mr. Zachary Lock, a member who \"began to speak,\r\nwho for very fear shook, so that he could not proceed, but stood still\r\nawhile, and at length sat down.\"[339] This same experience has since\r\nbefallen many another politician. The bravest men become inarticulate\r\nin similar circumstances. After the naval victory of June 1, 1794,\r\nVice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardiner received a vote of thanks from the\r\nHouse of Commons, and, though he had taken the precaution of\r\nfortifying himself with several bottles of Madeira, could scarcely\r\nsummon up courage to mumble a reply.[340] And in our own time we have\r\nseen another gallant officer overcome with \"House-fright\" to such an\r\nextent as to be unable to deliver the message which, in his official\r\ncapacity as Black Rod, he had brought to the Commons. John Bright\r\nnever rose in the House without what he called \"a trembling of the\r\nknees.\" Gladstone was always intensely nervous before a big speech.\r\nDisraeli declared that he would rather lead a forlorn hope than face\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n  [339] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 666.\r\n\r\n  [340] \"Life of Sidmouth,\" vol. i. p. 119.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING BY J. HALL AFTER THE PAINTING BY SIR J. REYNOLDS]\r\n\r\nA good description of the sensations felt by a panic-stricken member\r\nmaking his debut is given by Lord Guilford, son of Lord North, whose\r\nappearance in the House was brief, if not exactly meteoric. \"I brought\r\nout two or three sentences,\" he says, \"when a mist seemed to rise\r\nbefore my eyes. I then lost my recollection, and could see nothing but\r\nthe Speaker's wig, which swelled and swelled and swelled till it\r\ncovered the whole House.\"[341]\r\n\r\n  [341] Harford's \"Recollections of Wilberforce,\" p. 95. (Guilford\r\n  hastily resumed his seat, shortly afterwards applied for the Chiltern\r\n  Hundreds, and retired into comfortable obscurity.)\r\n\r\nThe failure of a first speech has not always been the presage of a\r\npolitician's future non-success. Addison broke down on the only\r\noccasion on which he attempted to address the House, yet he reached\r\nhigh office as Irish Secretary before he had been nine years in\r\nParliament.[342] Walpole's first speech was a complete failure, as\r\nwas, in a lesser degree, Canning's, though both were listened to in\r\nsilence. Even the silver-tongued Sheridan himself made a poor\r\nimpression upon the House with his earliest effort. After delivering\r\nhis maiden speech, he sought out his friend Woodfall, who had been\r\nsitting in the gallery, and asked for a candid opinion. \"I don't think\r\nthis is your line,\" said Woodfall. \"You had much better have stuck to\r\nyour former pursuits.\" Sheridan pondered for a moment. \"It is _in_\r\nme,\" he said at length with conviction, \"and, by God, it shall come\r\nout!\"[343] It certainly did.\r\n\r\n  [342] His first effort in the Irish House, in 1709, was singularly\r\n  abortive. \"Mr. Speaker, I conceive----\" he began. \"Mr. Speaker, I\r\n  conceive----\" he stammered out again. Shouts of \"Hear! hear!\"\r\n  encouraged him. \"I conceive, Mr. Speaker----\" he repeated, and then\r\n  collapsed. A cruel colleague at once rose and remarked that the hon.\r\n  gentleman had conceived three times and brought forth nothing!\r\n  O'Flanagan's \"Irish Chancellors,\" vol. ii. p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [343] Moore's \"Life of Sheridan,\" vol. i. p. 348.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, as is well known, was not even listened to, and had to bring\r\nhis maiden speech to an abrupt end. \"The time will come when you\r\n_shall_ hear me!\" he exclaimed prophetically as he resumed his seat.\r\nSuch treatment was, however, unusual, for though the House of Commons\r\nis occasionally, as Pepys called it, a beast not to be understood, so\r\nvariable and uncertain are its moods, new members are commonly\r\naccorded a patient and attentive hearing.\r\n\r\nSometimes a momentary breakdown has been retrieved under the stimulus\r\nof encouraging cheers from the House, and an infelicitous beginning\r\nhas led to an eloquent peroration. Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of\r\nShaftesbury, had prepared a speech on behalf of the Treason Bill of\r\n1695, which enacted that all persons indicted for high treason should\r\nhave a copy of the indictment supplied to them and be allowed the\r\nassistance of counsel. He was, however, so overcome with nervousness\r\non rising to his feet, that he could not proceed. Wittily recovering\r\nhimself, \"If I, who rise only to give my opinion on the Bill now\r\ndepending, am so confounded that I am unable to express the least of\r\nwhat I proposed to say,\" he observed, \"what must be the condition of\r\nthat man who without any assistance is pleading for his life, and is\r\nunder apprehensions of being deprived of it?\" He thus contrived to\r\nturn his nervousness to good account. Again, when Steele was brought\r\nto the bar for publishing \"The Crisis,\" a young member, Lord Finch,\r\nwhose sister Steele had defended in the \"Guardian\" against a libel,\r\nrose to make a maiden speech on behalf of his friend. After a few\r\nconfused sentences the youthful speaker broke down and was unable to\r\nproceed. \"Strange,\" he exclaimed, as he sat down in despair, \"that I\r\ncannot speak for this man, though I could readily fight for him!\" This\r\nremark elicited so much cheering that the member took heart, rose\r\nonce more, and made an able speech, which he subsequently followed up\r\nwith many another.[344]\r\n\r\n  [344] Forster's \"Biographical Essays,\" vol. ii. p. 195.\r\n\r\nAlthough early failure is no sure gauge of a politician's reputation\r\nor worth, many a happy first speech has raised hopes that remained\r\neternally unfulfilled. In the eighteenth century James Erskine, Lord\r\nGrange, made a brilliant maiden effort in the Commons and was much\r\napplauded. But the House soon grew weary of his broad Scots accent,\r\nand after hearing him patiently three or four times, gradually ceased\r\nto listen to him altogether.[345] William Gerard Hamilton, secretary\r\nto Lord Halifax (Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland), and afterwards Irish\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, though not fulfilling Bolingbroke's\r\ndefinition of eloquence,[346] earned the title of \"single-speech\r\nHamilton\" by one display of oratory which was never repeated.\r\n\r\n  [345] Dr. King's \"Anecdotes of His Own Time,\" p. 114.\r\n\r\n  [346] \"Eloquence,\" said Bolingbroke, \"must flow like a stream that is\r\n  fed by an abundant spring, and not spout forth a little frothy water\r\n  on some gaudy day and remain dry the rest of the year.\"\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the parliamentary novice to crave the indulgence\r\nof the House for such faults of manner or style as may be the result\r\nof youth or inexperience. This modest attitude on the part of a\r\nspeaker inspires his audience favourably; they become infused with a\r\nglow of conscious superiority which is most agreeable and inclines\r\nthem to listen with a kindly ear to the utterances of the budding\r\npolitician. Not always, however, is this humility expressed. William\r\nCobbett began his maiden speech on January 29, 1833, by remarking that\r\nin the short period during which he had sat in the House he had heard\r\na great deal of vain and unprofitable conversation.[347] Hunt, the\r\nPreston demagogue, showed his contempt for the Commons and his own\r\nself-assurance by speaking six times on six different subjects on the\r\nvery first night of his introduction.[348] William Cowper, afterwards\r\nLord Chancellor, addressed the House three times on the day he took\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n  [347] Dalling's \"Historical Characters,\" vol. ii. p. 175.\r\n\r\n  [348] Barrow's \"Mirror of Parliament\" (1830).\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords, too, can be heard maiden speeches delivered in\r\nmany varying styles. One perhaps may be made by an ex-Cabinet\r\nMinister, a distinguished member of Parliament recently promoted to\r\nthe Upper House, apologising in abject tones for his lack of\r\nexperience, and commending his humble efforts to the indulgence of his\r\naudience. Another emanates from some youthful nobleman who has just\r\nsucceeded to a peerage, whose political experience has yet to be won,\r\nand who addresses his peers in the didactic fashion of a headmaster\r\nlecturing a form of rather unintelligent schoolboys. It is not so very\r\nlong ago that a young peer--who has since made the acquaintance of\r\nmost divisions of the Supreme Court, from the Bankruptcy to the\r\nDivorce--astonished and entertained his colleagues by closing his\r\nperoration with a fervent prayer that God might long spare him to\r\nassist in their lordships' deliberations.\r\n\r\nThere is a golden mean between the two styles, the humble and the\r\nhaughty, which it is well for the embryo politician to cultivate\r\nbefore he attempts to impress Parliament with his eloquence.\r\n\r\nOratory has been defined in many different ways by many different\r\nwriters. Lord Chesterfield and Dr. Johnson, respectively, described it\r\nas the power of persuading people, or of beating down an adversary's\r\narguments and putting better ones in their place. The business of the\r\norator, according to Sir James Mackintosh, is to state plainly, to\r\nreason calmly, to seem transported into vehemence by his feelings, and\r\nroused into splendid imagery or description by his subject, but always\r\nto return to fact and argument, as that on which alone he is earnestly\r\nbent.[349] Gladstone, again, defined oratory as the speaker's power of\r\nreceiving from his audience in a vapour that which he pours back upon\r\nthem in a flood.\r\n\r\n  [349] Sir J. Mackintosh's \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii p. 192.\r\n\r\nOratory is perhaps the gift of the gods, but skill in speaking is\r\nundoubtedly an art that can be acquired by practice, if sought\r\ndiligently and with patience. Demosthenes gloried in the smell of the\r\nlamp; Cicero learnt every speech by heart. The former would go down to\r\nthe seashore on a stormy day, fill his mouth with pebbles, and speak\r\nloudly to the ocean, thus accustoming himself to the murmur of popular\r\nassemblies; the latter on one occasion rehearsed a speech so\r\ndiligently that he had little strength left to deliver it on the\r\nfollowing day. The sight of a modern politician sitting on the pier at\r\nBrighton delivering a marine address as intelligibly as a mouthful of\r\ngravel would permit, is one that would only excite feelings of alarm\r\nin the bosoms of his friends; the thought of a Cabinet Minister\r\nfainting before his looking-glass, as the result of an excessive\r\nrehearsal of his peroration, is more pathetic than practical. There\r\nis, however, nothing to prevent a member of Parliament from practising\r\nhis elocution upon the trees of the forest, as Grattan did,[350] or\r\nupon the House of Commons itself, and it is thus alone that he will\r\nacquire proficiency in that art in which it is so desirable for the\r\nstatesman to excel. \"It is absolutely necessary for you to speak in\r\nParliament,\" Lord Chesterfield wrote to his long-suffering son. \"It\r\nrequires only a little human attention and no supernatural\r\ngifts.\"[351]\r\n\r\n  [350] Grattan used to walk about the park at Windsor haranguing the\r\n  oaks in a loud voice. A passer-by once found him apostrophising an\r\n  empty gibbet. \"How did you get down?\" asked the stranger politely.\r\n  O'Flanagan, \"Irish Chancellors,\" vol. ii. p. 416.\r\n\r\n  [351] Letters, vol. ii. pp. 328-9.\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox resolved, when young, to speak at least once every\r\nnight in the House. During five whole sessions he held manfully to\r\nthis resolution, with the exception of one single evening--an\r\nexception which he afterwards regretted. He thus became the most\r\nbrilliant debater that ever lived, \"vehement in his elocution, ardent\r\nin his language, prompt in his invention of argument, adroit in its\r\nuse.\"[352] He was, however, too impetuous to be as great an orator as\r\nhis rival Pitt, whose majestic eloquence was almost divine,[353] and\r\noffended continually by the tautology of his diction and the constant\r\nrepetition of his arguments. The hesitation and lack of grace of his\r\ndelivery detracted greatly from the force of his speeches; the\r\nkeenness of his sabre, as Walpole said, was blunted by the difficulty\r\nwith which he drew it from the scabbard.[354] In a comparison of the\r\ntwo statesmen, Flood calls Pitt's speeches \"didactic declamations,\"\r\nand those of Fox \"argumentative conversations.\"[355]\r\n\r\n  [352] \"Lord Colchester's Diary,\" vol. i. p. 23.\r\n\r\n  [353] \"Pitt spoke like ten thousand angels,\" wrote Richard Grenville\r\n  to George Grenville in November, 1742 (\"Grenville Papers,\" vol. i. p.\r\n  19).\r\n\r\n  [354] \"Memoirs,\" vol. i. p. 490.\r\n\r\n  [355] Prior's \"Life of Malone,\" p. 361.\r\n\r\nIt was said that it required great mental exertion to follow Fox while\r\nhe was speaking, but none to remember what he had said; but that it\r\nwas easy to follow Pitt, but hard to remember what there was in his\r\nspeech that had pleased one. The difference between the two men was\r\nthe difference between the orator and the debater. It resulted largely\r\nfrom the fact that the one gave much time to the preparation of his\r\nspeeches, while the other relied upon the inspiration of the moment.\r\nPitt, as Porson says, carefully considered his sentences before he\r\nuttered them; Fox threw himself into the middle of his, \"and left it\r\nto God Almighty to get him out again.\"[356] If the former was the more\r\ndignified as a speaker, the latter scored by being always so terribly\r\nin earnest. Grattan, who affirmed that Pitt's eloquence marked an era\r\nin the senate, that it resembled \"sometimes the thunder, and sometimes\r\nthe music, of the spheres,\" and admitted that Pitt was right nine\r\ntimes for once that Fox was right, declared that that once of Fox was\r\nworth all the other nine times of Pitt.[357]\r\n\r\n  [356] Samuel Roger's \"Recollections,\" p. 80.\r\n\r\n  [357] \"Memoirs of Thomas Moore,\" vol. iv. p. 215. (Francis Howard\r\n  compared Pitt's eloquence to Handel's music, see \"Memoirs of Francis\r\n  Howard,\" vol. i. p. 149.)\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Parliament of those days was not so critical a body as it\r\nhas since become. Lord Chesterfield, at least, held it in the\r\nprofoundest contempt. \"When I first came into the House of Commons,\"\r\nhe says, \"I respected that assembly as a venerable one; and felt a\r\ncertain awe upon me; but, upon better acquaintance, that awe soon\r\nvanished; and I discovered that, of the five hundred and sixty, not\r\nabove thirty could understand reason, and that all the rest were\r\n_peuple_; that those thirty only required plain common-sense, dressed\r\nup in good language; and that all the others only required flowing and\r\nharmonious periods, whether they conveyed any meaning or not; having\r\nears to hear, but not sense enough to judge.\"[358] This scathing\r\nindictment of the intelligence of the Commons may possibly have been\r\ntrue at the time when it was written: it would certainly not be\r\napplicable to-day. Meaningless periods, however harmonious, are no\r\nlonger tolerated. In Lord Chesterfield's day, however, sound seems to\r\nhave been more important than sense, as may be gathered from an\r\naccount he gives elsewhere of a speech made in 1751 in the House of\r\nLords. He was speaking upon a Bill for the Reform of the Calendar, a\r\nsubject upon which he knew absolutely nothing. To conceal his\r\nignorance he conceived the idea of giving the House an historical\r\naccount of calendars generally, from Ancient Egyptian to modern times,\r\nbeing particularly attentive to the choice of his words, to the\r\nharmony of his periods, and to his elocution. The peers were\r\nenchanted. \"They thought I informed,\" he explains, \"because I pleased\r\nthem; and many of them said that I had made the whole very clear to\r\nthem, when, God knows, I had not even attempted it.\"[359]\r\n\r\n  [358] \"Letters to his Son,\" vol. ii. p. 329.\r\n\r\n  [359] \"Letters,\" ii. 121.\r\n\r\nThe gift of oratory is most certainly heaven-born, but its development\r\ndemands a vast amount of purely mundane labour. The best speeches have\r\never been those in the preparation of which the most time and trouble\r\nhave been expended. Burke's masterpieces were essays, laboriously\r\nconstructed in the study; Sheridan's elaborate impromptus were\r\ncarefully devised beforehand, and, if successful, occasionally\r\nrepeated.[360] Chatham, whose wonderful dominion over the House does\r\nnot perhaps appear in his speeches, chose his words with the greatest\r\ncare, and confided to a friend that in order to improve his vocabulary\r\nhe had read \"Bailey's Dictionary\" twice through from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n  [360] \"The hon. gentleman has applied to his imagination for his\r\n  facts, and to his memory for his wit,\" is a remark he made in\r\n  different forms on more than one occasion. See Harford's\r\n  \"Wilberforce,\" p. 167; Brougham's \"Sketches,\" vol. iii. p. 294, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fervid eloquence of such men as Plunket, Macaulay, Brougham, and\r\nCanning--\"the last of the rhetoricians\"--was the fruit of many an hour\r\nof laborious thought and study. Canning especially never spared\r\nhimself. He would draw up for use in the House a paper, on which were\r\nwritten the heads of the subjects which he intended to touch upon.\r\nThese heads were numbered, and the numbers sometimes extended to four\r\nor five hundred. Lord North, when he lost the thread of his discourse,\r\nwould look through his notes with the utmost nonchalance, seeking the\r\ncue which was to lead him to further flights of eloquence. \"It is not\r\non this side of the paper, Mr. Speaker,\" he would declaim, still\r\nspeaking in his oratorical tone; \"neither is it on the other side!\"\r\nThen, perhaps, he would suddenly come upon the desired note, and\r\ncontinue his unbroken oration without a sign of further\r\nhesitation.[361] Bright used to provide himself with small slips of\r\npaper, inscribed with his bon-mots, which he drew from his pocket as\r\noccasion required. He excelled, nevertheless, in scathing repartee.\r\nOnce, during his absence through illness, a noble lord stated publicly\r\nthat Bright had been afflicted by Providence with a disease of the\r\nbrain as a punishment for his misuse of his talents. \"It may be so,\"\r\nsaid Bright, on his return to the House, \"but in any case it will be\r\nsome consolation to the friends and family of the noble lord to know\r\nthat the disease is one which even Providence could not inflict upon\r\nhim.\"[362] He did not always get the best of it, however, and when he\r\nridiculed Lord John Manners for the youthful couplet--\r\n\r\n    \"Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,\r\n    But leave us still our old nobility!\"\r\n\r\nthe author justly retorted that he would far sooner be the foolish\r\nyoung man who wrote those lines than the malignant old man who quoted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  [361] Stapleton's \"Life of Canning,\" p. 21.\r\n\r\n  [362] \"Men and Manners in Parliament,\" pp. 56-59.\r\n\r\nThat speeches should be as effective when read as when delivered is\r\nthe highest quality of oratory. For this reason, perhaps, some\r\nspeakers write out their speeches and commit them to memory. Disraeli\r\ndid so with his more important orations, a fact which greatly enhances\r\nthe pleasure of their perusal. Macaulay followed the same practice,\r\nand, indeed, it is said that the excessive elaboration of his oratory\r\nsometimes weakened its effect. Lord Randolph Churchill's earlier\r\nspeeches were all memorised in this fashion. But it is not every man\r\nwhose memory is sufficiently retentive to enable him to accomplish\r\nthis feat, and a breakdown in the very middle of a humorous anecdote\r\nthoughtfully interspersed in a speech is a catastrophe which casts\r\nridicule upon the speaker.[363]\r\n\r\n  [363] Mr. R. Tennant, member for Belfast, in 1834, on O'Connell's\r\n  motion for a repeal of the Union, made a speech which he had learnt by\r\n  heart and sent to the papers, which lasted three and a half hours.\r\n  Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 66.\r\n\r\nThough matter may be a most important element in parliamentary\r\nspeaking, manner undoubtedly counts for a good deal. Demosthenes\r\npractised declaiming with sharp weapons suspended above him so as to\r\nlearn to keep still, and, as we have already seen, had some obscure\r\nreason for filling his mouth with pebbles. Neither of these practices\r\nis to be commended to modern orators, many of whom already speak as\r\nthough their mouths were filled with hot potatoes, while their\r\nhabitual gesticulations, if made in the neighbourhood of dependent\r\ncutlery, would result in reducing their bodies to one huge wound. Sir\r\nWatkin Wynne and his brother were long known in the House of Commons\r\nas \"Bubble and Squeak,\" the former's voice being a smothered mumble\r\nsuggestive of suppressed thunder, the latter's a childish treble.\r\nMannerisms of gesture, as well as of speech, are easily contracted.\r\nLord Mahon, \"out-roaring torrents in their course,\" reinforced his\r\nstentorian lungs by violent gestures which were at times a source of\r\nbodily danger to his friends. Once, when speaking on a Bill he had\r\nbrought in for the suppression of smuggling, he declared that this\r\ncrime must be knocked on the head with one blow. To emphasize his\r\nmeaning, he dealt the unfortunate Pitt, who was sitting just in front\r\nof him, a violent buffet on the head, much to the amusement of the\r\nHouse.[364] The gesticulations of Sir Charles Wetherell, the\r\nwell-known member, were less dangerous, if quainter. He used to\r\nunbutton his braces in a nervous fashion while addressing the House,\r\nleaving between his upper and lower garments an interregnum to which\r\nSpeaker Manners Sutton once alluded as the honourable gentleman's only\r\nlucid interval. The late Lord Goschen would grasp himself firmly by\r\nthe lapel of his coat, as though (to quote a well-known parliamentary\r\nwriter) \"otherwise he might run away and leave matters to explain\r\nthemselves.\"[365]\r\n\r\n  [364] Wraxall's \"Memoirs,\" vol. iii. p. 402.\r\n\r\n  [365] \"Men and Manners in Parliament,\" p. 109. (Further on the writer\r\n  describes the peculiarities of another member who used to fold his\r\n  arms tightly across his chest when he spoke. Thereafter a constant\r\n  struggle went on, the arms restlessly battling to get free, and the\r\n  speaker insisting that they should remain and hear the speech out, p.\r\n  130.)\r\n\r\nParliamentary eloquence to-day makes up in quantity for what it lacks\r\nin quality. The number of members who follow the advice of the\r\nPsalmist and earn a reputation for wisdom by a continual policy of\r\neloquent silence[366] has dwindled to vanishing point, since to speak\r\nin Parliament has come to be regarded as part of a member's duty to\r\nhis constituents. In Gladstone's first session, in 1833, less than\r\n6000 speeches were made in the House of Commons; fifty years later the\r\nnumber had increased to 21,000; to-day the steadily growing bulk of\r\neach volume of the \"Parliamentary Debates\" testifies to the swelling\r\nflood of oratory which is annually let loose within the precincts of\r\nParliament. And if La Rochefoucauld's maxim be true, that we readily\r\npardon those who bore us, but never those whom we bore, the House of\r\nCommons has need of a most forgiving spirit to listen patiently to so\r\nmuch of what can only be described as _vox et praeterea nihil_.\r\n\r\n  [366] \"Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he\r\n  that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe level of eloquence is, no doubt, higher in the House of Lords than\r\nelsewhere. Peers include a greater number of orators among their\r\nnumbers; opportunities for a display of their talents are more rare;\r\ntheir powers are not dissipated in prolonged debates, as in the\r\nCommons, but are reserved for full-dress occasions.\r\n\r\nIn neither House nowadays is there any exhibition of that\r\nold-fashioned rhetoric, florid and flamboyant, which was once so\r\npopular. What Mackintosh calls \"an elevated kind of after-dinner\r\nconversation,\" such as Lord Salisbury affected so successfully, is the\r\nform taken by modern parliamentary eloquence. There are no appeals to\r\nsentiment, no quotations from the classics, no bombastic\r\ndeclamations.[367] The House of Commons is still \"a mob of gentlemen,\r\nthe greater part of whom are neither without talent nor\r\ninformation,\"[368] and with such an audience learned generalities are\r\nout of place. Passion has to a large extent given way to business, and\r\nin Parliament to-day are rarely heard those \"splendid common-places of\r\nthe first-rate rhetorician,\" which Lord Morley considers necessary to\r\nsway assemblies.\r\n\r\n  [367] \"Don't quote Latin. Say what you have to say and then sit down!\"\r\n  was the Duke of Wellington's excellent advice to a young member.\r\n  Walter Bagehot, on the other hand, stated that he had heard an\r\n  experienced financier say, \"If you want to raise a certain cheer in\r\n  the House of Commons, make a general panegyric on economy; if you want\r\n  to invite a sure defeat, propose a particular saving!\" \"The English\r\n  Constitution,\" p. 136.\r\n\r\n  [368] Dalling's \"Historical Characters,\" vol. ii. p. 39.\r\n\r\nWe live in a material age. The flowers of rhetoric bloom no longer in\r\nthe cold business-like atmosphere of the parliamentary garden; only\r\nthe more practical but unromantic vegetables remain. The rich\r\nembroideries of trope and metaphor have been roughly torn from modern\r\nspeech, leaving the bare skeleton of reason exposed to the public\r\ngaze. The grandiose orator of the past, with his ornate phraseology,\r\nhis graceful periods, his quotations from the poets, has been ousted\r\nby the passionless debater, flinging, like the improvident O'Connell,\r\nhis brood of robust thoughts into the world, without a rag to cover\r\nthem. No one to-day would dream of expending fifty shillings--let\r\nalone fifty guineas--for the privilege of hearing a modern Sheridan\r\naddress a twentieth-century Parliament; no modern Grattan (as Sheil\r\nmight say) shatters the pinnacles of this establishment with the\r\nlightning of his eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe successful parliamentary speaker is no longer one who is able, in\r\nthe words of Macaulay, to produce with rapidity a series of stirring\r\nbut transitory impressions, to excite the minds of five hundred\r\ngentlemen at midnight, without saying anything that any of them will\r\nremember in the morning.[369] Rather is he the cold judicious\r\npolitician who chooses his words less for their beauty than for their\r\nimmunity from subsequent perversion, who can crystallise in a few\r\nbrief sentences, within the compass of a few minutes, the opinions\r\nthat it would have taken his ancestors as many hours to express in the\r\nturgid rhetoric of a bygone age. The orator--as the name was once\r\nunderstood--is now a _rara avis_, but seldom raising his tuneful voice\r\nabove the raucous cawing of his fellows. And whoever feels with Gibbon\r\nthat the great speakers fill him with despair, and the bad ones with\r\nterror, will leave the precincts of Parliament to-day more often\r\nterrorstricken than desperate. That this should be so is no reason for\r\ngiving way to gloom or sorrow. Parliamentary eloquence is not\r\nnecessarily the sign of a country's greatness. The English Parliament,\r\nwhich began by acclaiming Burke as the prince of orators, soon became\r\nindifferent to his powers, and ended by labelling him the \"Dinner\r\nBell.\" Fox has left no memorial of any good wrought by his oratory.\r\n\"Neither the Habeas Corpus Act, nor the Bill of Rights, nor Magna\r\nCharta originated in eloquence,\" and if it be true that \"a senate of\r\norators is a symptom of material decay,\"[370] we may look forward to\r\nthe future of England with calm and perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n  [369] \"Essays,\" vol. ii. p. 206.\r\n\r\n  [370] Sir H. Crabb Robinson's \"Diary, Reminiscences and\r\n  Correspondence,\" vol. i. p. 330.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENT AT WORK--(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their efforts to grapple successfully with the ever-increasing mass\r\nof business brought before them, modern Parliaments show a tendency to\r\nprolong their labours to an ever-increasing extent. Each succeeding\r\nsession lengthens, as Macaulay said, \"like a human hair in the mouth.\"\r\n\r\nIn Tudor times the statutes to be passed were few in number, and the\r\ntime occupied in legislation was consequently short. Members returned\r\nby \"rotten\" boroughs had no temptation to be prolix; their seats did\r\nnot depend upon their parliamentary exertions, and their speeches were\r\ntherefore commendably brief. Parliament to-day is often censured for\r\nthe sterility of its legislative output, but during the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries legislation in the modern sense of the word\r\nscarcely existed at all. Its time was chiefly spent in the discussion\r\nof libellous books and in disputes over constitutional questions of\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nOctober and November were the months fixed for the meeting of\r\nParliament in Hanoverian times, and the prorogation usually took place\r\nin April. From 1805 to 1820 it met after Christmas. Since 1820\r\nFebruary has been the month generally chosen. Nowadays, not only have\r\nthe sessions grown much longer--even the feast of St. Grouse on the\r\n12th of August is no longer observed by politicians--but the hours of\r\neach sitting have been considerably extended. The session of 1847 was\r\nprolonged over 293 days; the Parliament of 1852 met on November 4 and\r\nsat until August 20 of the following year, and during the last two\r\nmonths of that session the House of Commons continued sitting for\r\nfifteen out of every twenty-four hours. In 1908, which contained two\r\nsessions, the House sat for 253 days, and the session of 1909 lasted\r\nfrom February 16 till December 3, during the latter weeks of which\r\nall-night sittings were of the commonest occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the daily labours of the Legislature increased the\r\nhour for commencing work became later and later. In Charles I.'s time\r\nParliament often met as early as 7 a.m., and would sit until twelve,\r\nthe afternoon being devoted to the work of the committees.[371] Later\r\non the hour of meeting was fixed for 8 or 9 a.m., and the House\r\nusually rose at 4 p.m., or earlier. The Commons always showed the\r\nstrongest disinclination to sit in the afternoon, either because the\r\nmidday meal did not leave them in a fit condition to legislate, or\r\nbecause no regular provision was made for lighting the House when\r\ntwilight fell. \"This council is a grave council and sober,\" said a\r\nmember in 1659, and \"ought not to do things in the dark,\" and the\r\nSpeaker would occasionally regard his inability to distinguish one\r\nmember from another as a sufficient excuse for adjourning the\r\nHouse.[372] The practice of sitting regularly after dark did not\r\ncommence until the year 1717, when, by an order of the House, the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms was directed to bring in candles as soon as daylight\r\nfailed. Prior to that year the employment of artificial light had to\r\nbe made the subject of a special motion, and Sergeants were sometimes\r\nreprimanded for providing candles without the necessary order.\r\n\r\n  [371] On Sunday, August 8, 1641, both Houses attended divine service\r\n  at St. Margaret's Church at 6 a.m., after which they sat in the House\r\n  all the morning, and in the afternoon the King met them in the\r\n  banqueting room at Whitehall. \"Duirnall Occurrences,\" p. 80.\r\n\r\n  [372] Forster's \"Grand Remonstrance,\" p. 342.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the hours of sitting\r\nvaried from time to time. Up to 1888 the House of Commons sat from 10\r\na.m. until 3.45 p.m. In that year the time for meeting was fixed at 3\r\np.m. and this was subsequently postponed for an hour.\r\n\r\nSaturday and Sunday have long been recognised as regular parliamentary\r\nholidays, and on one other day in the week--either a Wednesday or\r\nFriday--the House of Commons has adjourned at an earlier hour than\r\nusual. This, however, was not always the case. In Stuart times\r\nParliament sometimes sat on Sunday and even on Christmas Day,[373] and\r\nit was on a Sunday--December 18, 1831--that the Reform Bill was read a\r\nsecond time. This, however, was an exceptional instance, the\r\nadjournment over Saturday having been initiated by Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nwho, as a keen sportsman, was always anxious to get away to the\r\ncountry, and believed that, as Dryden says, it were:\r\n\r\n    \"Better to hunt in fields for health unbought,\r\n    Than fee the doctor for his noxious draught.\"\r\n\r\n  [373] Elsynge's \"Ancient Method of Holding Parliaments,\" pp. 114-115.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times it became the fashion to adjourn the House on\r\nDerby Day, in order to allow legislators to take part in the sport of\r\nkings. In 1872, this adjournment was made the subject of a heated\r\ndebate, and though the division that ensued resulted in a large\r\nmajority for the holiday-makers, the claims of sport gradually gave\r\nway to the more pressing demands of business, and ten years later,\r\nwhen the Prevention of Crimes (Ireland) Act was under discussion, the\r\nmatter was considered too serious to allow of the usual Derby Day\r\nadjournment. The late Sir Wilfrid Lawson once cynically argued that if\r\nthe Derby Day became a recognised official holiday the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons ought to go to Epsom in his State-coach, \"as he did\r\nat the thanksgiving for the Prince of Wales's recovery.\" The game of\r\npolitics is nowadays treated more gravely than ever, and the most\r\nfrivolous of modern politicians would scarcely dream of suggesting\r\nthat the stern business of Westminster should be deserted for the\r\npleasures of Epsom Downs. The House of Lords has always, until a year\r\nor two ago, adjourned over Ash Wednesday and Ascension Day, on the\r\nground that if they met they would be taken to Church at the Abbey;\r\nbut lately they have braved this terror and nothing so serious has\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1882 the House of Lords met at five o'clock in the afternoon;\r\nthey now meet three-quarters of an hour earlier.[374] Except under\r\ncircumstances of special pressure they take holidays on Friday and\r\nSaturday, and Sunday is, of course, for them, as for everybody else, a\r\nday of complete rest. Occasionally on other days the amount of work to\r\nbe undertaken in the Upper House is so small as to be accomplished in\r\na few minutes. The Lords, as has been irreverently observed, often sit\r\nscarcely long enough to boil an egg, and it is only towards the end of\r\nthe session that they are compelled to extend their deliberations\r\nbeyond the dinner-hour.[375]\r\n\r\n  [374] The judicial sittings of the House begin at 10.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n  [375] The proceedings very often resemble those of the old Irish House\r\n  of Lords, which we find recorded in the Journals as \"Prayers. Ordered,\r\n  that the Judges be covered. Adjourned.\" See Charlemont's \"Memoirs,\"\r\n  vol. i. p. 103.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the Commons are more arduous, and entail longer hours\r\nof sitting. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday the House\r\nmeets at 2.45 p.m. and continues sitting until 11 p.m., unless the\r\nday's business has been disposed of before that hour. At eleven\r\no'clock the Speaker interrupts business, after which no opposed matter\r\ncan be dealt with, but, by a Standing Order, it is permissible for a\r\nMinister of the Crown, at the commencement of the day's work, to move\r\nthe suspension of the eleven o'clock rule. In this case no\r\ninterruption takes place until the business under discussion is\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nAll-night sittings are not uncommon nowadays, but in former times they\r\noccurred but rarely. In 1742, the Speaker once sat in the Chair for\r\nseventeen hours at a stretch, and some fifty years later we find the\r\nCommons keeping an occasional all-night vigil. Sir Samuel Romilly left\r\nthe House one evening to go to bed, and returned the next morning to\r\nfind his colleagues still sitting. He began his speech by saying that\r\nhe made no apology for rising to address the House at such a time, as\r\nseven o'clock was his usual hour for \"getting up.\"[376] In 1877, the\r\nCommons sat for a day and night, and again in 1881, the sitting on the\r\nlatter occasion lasting forty-one hours; and since that day many\r\nsittings have been prolonged over the twenty-four hours. In 1909, the\r\nHouse sat after 1 a.m. o'clock on no less than thirty-seven occasions,\r\nafter 4 a.m. on ten occasions, and once as late as nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n  [376] Palgrave's \"House of Commons,\" p. 45.\r\n\r\nFriday is, so to speak, a half-holiday for the Commons. On that day\r\nthe House meets at noon, the interruption of business occurs at five\r\no'clock, and, no matter what subject is under discussion, the House\r\nadjourns at 5.30 p.m. Before 1902, Wednesday was the day chosen for\r\nthe short sitting, but the desire of many members to escape from\r\nLondon at the end of the week led to a change, and it is now possible\r\nfor representatives from the most distant parts of England to pay\r\nflying weekly visits to their homes or constituencies.\r\n\r\nFor a few years recently the House of Commons always enjoyed an\r\nevening interval for dinner, but this agreeable adjournment was\r\nreluctantly sacrificed in 1906, and the \"Speaker's chop\" is now\r\nnothing but a fragrant memory. The dinner-hour is much too precious to\r\nbe wasted at any table other than that of the House, for at 8.15 on\r\nmany days any private business not disposed of at the beginning of the\r\nsitting is given precedence of all else, and what is known as\r\n\"opposed\" private business is also taken between that hour and 9.30\r\np.m.[377]\r\n\r\n  [377] The fact of any single member taking objection to a motion is\r\n  sufficient to include it among \"opposed\" business, and in an assembly\r\n  of partisans it would be too much to expect that any private member's\r\n  Bill should avoid giving grounds of objection to at least one\r\n  opponent.\r\n\r\nFor the information of members a daily \"notice paper\" is published in\r\ntwo editions--a blue edition in the morning, and a white one in the\r\nearly afternoon--containing the orders of the day and all notices of\r\nmotions. To this is attached the \"votes and proceedings,\" division\r\nlists, and an account of the business accomplished at the last\r\nsitting. In the \"order book\" of the House, also published daily, is a\r\nlist of all future business definitely assigned to any particular\r\nsitting; while once a week a catalogue of all Public Bills that have\r\nbeen introduced, and some report of their progress, is also included.\r\n\r\nBy no means the least arduous of the many labours of Parliament are\r\nthose which are undertaken by legislators serving upon the various\r\nCommittees, of which the public knows so little, but whose work is\r\nvery necessary to the carrying on of public business.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Select Committees in both Houses has been practised\r\never since the earliest days of Parliament. The duties of these\r\nsubsidiary bodies, which may be appointed for any purpose, are\r\nprescribed by the terms of the reference: they may collect facts for\r\nfuture legislation, investigate conduct, or examine the terms of a\r\nBill referred to them, thus saving the time of the House. To them go\r\nall opposed Private Bills, when counsel appear to argue the merits of\r\nclashing interests.\r\n\r\nThe system of Committees perhaps originated in the conferences held in\r\nformer times by the two Houses in the Painted Chamber. There are\r\nrecords of small deliberative bodies, somewhat similar in character to\r\nthe modern Committees, in the middle of the sixteenth century. By the\r\ntime Queen Elizabeth came to the throne such Committees were common,\r\nand were usually composed of members of one or other House. Select\r\nCommittees did not exist until the eighteenth century, and were\r\noriginally semi-judicial in character.\r\n\r\nAll members of the House of Commons are subject to be called upon to\r\nserve on Select Committees, being chosen for the purpose by a\r\nCommittee of Selection, and the work thus done outside the actual\r\nChamber adds considerably to the daily labours of politicians. No\r\nmember may refuse to serve, if called upon to do so, and when, in\r\n1846, Mr. Smith O'Brien declined to sit on an English Railway\r\nCommittee, he was confined in the Clock Tower in the custody of the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nThe whole House can also resolve itself at any time into a Committee,\r\nwhen its function becomes one of \"deliberation rather than\r\ninquiry.\"[378] Every Public Bill not referred to a Grand Committee\r\nmust be considered in a Committee of the Whole House, and, indeed, the\r\ngreater part of each session is occupied by this stage of legislation.\r\nThe Committee of Supply and the Committee of Ways and Means are both\r\n\"Committees of the Whole House,\" and are appointed to discuss the\r\nfinancial projects of the Government, the one to supervise\r\nexpenditure, the other to devise taxation.\r\n\r\n  [378] May, p. 430.\r\n\r\nA Committee of the Whole House differs in no respect from the House\r\nitself, save that it is presided over by a chairman in place of the\r\nSpeaker, and that the mace is removed from the Table. There are also\r\nsome changes in the procedure of debate, as, for example, the\r\ncancelling of the rule forbidding a member to speak twice on the same\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe idea of forming the House itself into a committee has developed,\r\nlike so many parliamentary institutions, gradually and almost\r\nunconsciously. In days when the Speaker was too often the spy of the\r\nKing it was considered advisable to get rid of him, and this could\r\nbest be done by turning the House into a Committee and putting some\r\nother member in the Chair.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of Committees in the Lords, and the Chairman of Ways and\r\nMeans, or his deputy, in the Commons, takes the Chair when the House\r\nis in Committee, but it is permissible for either House to nominate\r\nany one of their number as a temporary Chairman.[379]\r\n\r\n  [379] In 1641, during the Long Parliament, Hyde was appointed Chairman\r\n  of Committees, so as to get him out of the way, that he might not\r\n  obstruct business by too much speaking. Parry's \"Parliaments of\r\n  England,\" p. 354.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for Committees of the Whole House in the Commons, two\r\nlarge Standing Committees, sometimes called Grand Committees,\r\nnumbering from sixty to eighty members, are appointed to consider\r\nrespectively all Bills relating to Law and Trade committed to them by\r\nthe House. Besides the smaller committees already referred to there\r\nare Sessional Committees, appointed for each session, consisting of\r\nfrom eight to twelve members--as, for instance, the committee on\r\nPublic Accounts, which meets once a week to look into the department\r\nof the Auditor-General--which control the internal arrangements of the\r\nHouse; and joint Committees of the two Houses, which discuss matters\r\nin which both are interested.\r\n\r\nIn the Lords also Standing Committees were instituted in 1889, but\r\nthese were to supplement and not supersede the Whole House Committee\r\nstage, and after an experience of more than twenty years have proved\r\ntheir insufficient utility, they were abolished on June 24, 1910.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century committees generally met outside the House,\r\nin the Star Chamber, in Lincoln's Inn, or elsewhere, but they have not\r\ndone so for many years, numerous committee-rooms being nowadays\r\nprovided within the precincts of the House.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of every session the House of Lords elects a\r\nChairman of Committees from among its own members. His duty it is to\r\npreside over Committees of the Whole House, or over Select Committees\r\non whom the power of appointing their own Chairman is not expressly\r\nconferred. He is a salaried official of Parliament, and receives a sum\r\nof £2500 a year for his services. Similar duties are undertaken in the\r\nHouse of Commons by a Chairman of Committees and a Deputy Chairman, at\r\nsalaries of £2500 and £1000 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Crown usually appoints by commission one or more Lords to supply\r\nthe place of Lord Chancellor, should that official be unavoidably\r\nabsent. On emergency it may be moved that any lord present may be\r\nappointed temporarily to sit Speaker. In the House of Commons the\r\nChairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman are similarly\r\nempowered to replace the Speaker when absent.\r\n\r\nThe problem of providing a substitute for the Speaker was not settled\r\nuntil 1855, prior to which date no steps seem to have been taken to\r\nfill the Chair in the event of a Speaker's sudden illness or absence.\r\nIt appears to have been considered inadvisable to frame any scheme of\r\nrelief which should facilitate his frequent absence. It was, further,\r\nthe general sense of the House that no temporary president could\r\ncommand that implicit acquiescence in the rulings of the Chair which\r\nis so necessary for the maintenance of order in debate.\r\n\r\nTo the Chairman of Committees, whom one would regard as a natural\r\nsubstitute for the Speaker, the House has never been willing to accord\r\nthe complete consideration to which the Chair is entitled; the fact\r\nthat he is liable at any moment to sink again into the body of the\r\nHouse robs this official of much of his authority. In the reign of\r\nJames I. we find a Chairman complaining that some member had\r\nthreatened to \"pull him out of the Chair, that he should put no more\r\ntricks upon the House.\" And in 1810 another member, Fuller by name,\r\nwho had lost the Chairman's eye and his own temper, called that\r\nofficial a \"d---- insignificant puppy,\" and said that he didn't care a\r\nsnap of the fingers for him or for the House either.[380]\r\n\r\n  [380] Lytton's \"Life of Palmerston,\" vol. i. p. 115.\r\n\r\nThe question of replacing the Speaker has, therefore, always been a\r\ndelicate one, and for many years no attempt was made to solve it. In\r\n1656, owing to the illness of Sir Thomas Widdrington, another member\r\noccupied the Chair for a period of a few weeks, and, during the next\r\nfew years, several Speakers complained of ill-health and were\r\ntemporarily relieved. From 1547, when the Journals commence, to 1660,\r\nthe Speaker was only absent on twelve occasions, and during the next\r\nhundred years the records of the House show only six cases of absence.\r\nThe inconvenience caused by the rule which necessitated an\r\nadjournment on such occasions--curiously few in number though they\r\nwere--can readily be imagined. On the death of Queen Anne, in 1714,\r\nthe whole proceedings of Parliament were delayed, and the sittings\r\npostponed from day to day owing to the Speaker being away in the\r\ncountry and taking a long time to travel to London. The duty of being\r\never in his place at times involved great hardships. Addington was\r\nobliged to take the Chair three days after the death of his father,\r\npersevering by a painful effort in this stern adherence to the path of\r\nduty.[381]\r\n\r\n  [381] Pellew's \"Life of Sidmouth,\" vol. i. p. 76.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1640, a prolonged session was the cause of many members\r\nabsenting themselves from their places in the House of Commons. In\r\norder to ensure a more general attendance it was then determined that\r\nthe Speaker should not take the Chair unless there were at least forty\r\nmembers present in the House. This rule still holds good, and to-day,\r\nif a quorum of forty is not obtainable before four o'clock, the\r\nsitting is suspended until that hour. Should the same difficulty arise\r\nafter four o'clock, the House is adjourned until the next sitting\r\nday.[382] An exception is made in favour of the hour between 8.15 and\r\n9.15, but if a division be taken during that hour in the absence of a\r\nquorum, the business in debate must be postponed and the next business\r\nbrought on. When, too, a message from the Crown is delivered, the\r\nHouse of Commons is held to be \"made\" even though forty members are\r\nnot present. On such an occasion the business of the day can be\r\nproceeded with so long as no notice is taken of the absence of a\r\nquorum.\r\n\r\n  [382] The right of \"counting out\" the House was not exercised until\r\n  1729. On May 19, 1876, the Commons failed to \"make the House\" for the\r\n  first time since April 4, 1865. See Irving's \"Annals of Our Time,\"\r\n  vol. ii. p. 197.\r\n\r\nIt is not the Speaker's (or Chairman's) duty to notice the absence of\r\na quorum, but if his attention is drawn to it by a member he must at\r\nonce rise in his place and proceed to count the House. There is a\r\nwell-known story of a prolix member speaking to empty benches in the\r\nCommons who referred sarcastically to the packed audience hanging upon\r\nhis words, and was interrupted by the Speaker, who at once proceeded\r\nto \"count out\" the House, and put an end to the sitting as well as to\r\nthe member's oration. The Speaker's inability to count the House out\r\nof his own accord has occasionally given rise to inconvenient\r\nsituations. Lord George Gordon once rose and requested permission to\r\nread from a book, which was granted. He then proceeded to read the\r\nBible until the House dwindled from upwards of four hundred members to\r\ntwo, namely, the Speaker and Lord George himself, who had the\r\nindecency to keep the former in the Chair till the candles were\r\n\"fairly in the socket.\"[383]\r\n\r\n  [383] Pearson's \"Political Dictionary,\" pp. 23-4.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords three peers form a quorum. If, however, thirty\r\nlords are not present on a division upon any stage of a Bill, the\r\nquestion is declared to be not decided, and the debate is adjourned\r\nuntil the next sitting. Lord Rosebery, in 1884, recalled an occasion\r\nwhen a noble lord, Lord Leitrim, addressed a quorum of the House,\r\nconsisting, besides himself, of the Lord Chancellor and the Minister\r\nwhose duty it was to answer him, for four mortal hours. Another\r\ninstance of the same kind is supposed to have occurred when Lord\r\nLyndhurst was on the Woolsack and a noble lord spoke at considerable\r\nlength to an audience of even smaller proportions. After a time the\r\nChancellor became very weary and could scarcely conceal his\r\nimpatience. \"This is too bad,\" he said at length, \"can't you stop?\"\r\nStill, the peer prosed on, showing no sign of reaching his peroration.\r\nFinally, Lyndhurst could stand it no longer. \"By Jove,\" he cried,\r\nsuddenly inspired with a brilliant idea, \"I will count you out!\" As he\r\nand the speaker only were present in the House at the time, the\r\nChancellor was able to do this, and the long-winded nobleman was\r\neffectually silenced.\r\n\r\nIn early times the daily sittings of Parliament were preceded by Mass\r\nheld in St. Stephen's Chapel. Later on it became the custom for the\r\nlords to repair to the Abbey, and the Commons to St. Margaret's\r\nChurch, for a brief morning service. In the Parliaments of Queen\r\nElizabeth the Litany was read daily, and a short prayer offered up by\r\nthe Speaker at the meeting of the House. Prior to 1563, no regular\r\ndaily prayers were held, but on the first five days of any Parliament\r\n\"an archbishop, bishop or famous clerk, discrete and eloquent,\"\r\npreached to the House.[384] This practice long continued, and we read\r\nof \"Dr. Burgesse and Master Marshal,\" preaching to Parliament on a\r\nfast day in the year 1640 for \"at least seven hours betwixt\r\nthem\"[385]--an occasion when their eloquence seems to have outrun\r\ntheir discretion.\r\n\r\n  [384] \"The Manner of Holding Parliaments Prior to the Reign of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth.\" \"Somers Tract,\" p. 12.\r\n\r\n  [385] \"Diurnall Occurrences,\" p. 8.\r\n\r\nNineteen years later Richard Cromwell appointed the first regular\r\nchaplain to relieve the Speaker and the discreet and eloquent prelates\r\nand clerks of their duties. This official enjoyed no fixed emoluments,\r\nbut was upheld and nourished by the consciousness of duty nobly done\r\nand the hope of subsequent preferment. His counterpart to-day is\r\nappointed by the Speaker and paid by the House, and his duties consist\r\nin reading the three brief prayers with which each daily session of\r\nthe House commences.[386] In the Lords this task is undertaken by the\r\nbishops in rotation.\r\n\r\n  [386] In 1909, during the temporary absence of the Chaplain, the\r\n  Speaker read prayers himself.\r\n\r\nWhen prayers are over in the Lower House any \"private business\" that\r\nhas to be taken is called on, and Private Bills pass through the\r\ninitiatory stages of their career. The procedure in this case is, as a\r\nrule, purely formal, and lasts but a short time.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of private business is immediately followed by the oral\r\npresentation of petitions by those members who have informed the\r\nSpeaker of their intention to do so.\r\n\r\nIn these days of open courts of justice, a free Press, and wholesale\r\npublicity the need for petitions is not so great as it was in times\r\nwhen the voice of the people could not always obtain a hearing. To-day\r\nthe papers are only too ready to lend their columns to the airing of\r\nany grievance, real or imaginary, and politicians are not unwilling to\r\nmake party capital out of any individual instances of apparent\r\ninjustice or oppression that may be brought to their notice.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago all petitions were read to the House by the\r\nmembers presenting them, and lengthy discussions often ensued. Much\r\nwaste of time resulted from this practice, and the frequent arrival at\r\nWestminster of large bodies of petitioners caused great inconvenience,\r\nand sometimes led to rioting. In 1641, a huge crowd of women\r\ncompletely blocked the entrance of the House. They were led by a\r\ncertain Mrs. Anne Stagg, \"a gentlewoman and brewer's wife,\" and their\r\nobject was to present a petition directed against the Popish\r\nbishops.[387] The Sergeant of the Parliamentary Guard appealed to the\r\nHouse for advice as to how he should treat these women, and was told\r\nto speak them fair and send them away. This he accordingly proceeded\r\nto do, but not without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n  [387] \"Parl. Hist.\" ii. 1072. Butler refers to them in \"Hudibras\":\r\n\r\n      \"The oyster women lock'd their fish up,\r\n       And trudg'd away to cry 'No Bishop!'\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later three thousand other \"mean women,\" wearing white\r\nribbons in their hats, arrived at Westminster with another petition.\r\n\"Peace! Peace!\" they cried, in a manner which was little calculated to\r\ngain that which they were seeking. \"Give us those traitors that are\r\nagainst peace, that we may tear them to pieces! Give us that dog Pym!\"\r\nThe conduct of these viragoes at length became so unruly that the\r\ntrained bands were sent for, and the order was eventually given to\r\nfire upon the mob. \"When the gentle sex can so flagrantly renounce\r\ntheir character, and make such formidable attacks on the men,\" says a\r\ncontemporary historian, \"they certainly forfeit the polite treatment\r\ndue to them as women\"--and in this case their forgetfulness cost them\r\nthe loss of several lives.[388]\r\n\r\n  [388] Noorthouck's \"A New History of London,\" p. 180. Scenes of a\r\n  similar character occurred in the reign of George III., when the\r\n  Gordon rioters stormed the Houses of Parliament, shouting \"No Popery!\"\r\n  In 1871, a mob of matchmakers marched to Westminster to protest\r\n  against a tax on matches, and were dispersed by the police. In still\r\n  more recent times female deputations in favour of Woman's Suffrage,\r\n  accompanied by a mob of inquisitive sightseers and a section of the\r\n  criminal classes, have besieged the Palace of Westminster in a vain\r\n  attempt to gain admittance to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nTo-day, under the provisions of the One Mile Act of George III.--the\r\nresult of an attack made upon the Regent on his way from the opening\r\nof Parliament in 1817--no assembly of petitioners or public meeting is\r\nallowed within a mile of the Palace of Westminster. Petitions\r\nthemselves are treated in a summary manner which permits of little\r\ntime being wasted. No debate is permitted upon the subjects raised by\r\npetitions, and the formal method of presentation has given place to a\r\nmore satisfactory (if somewhat perfunctory) fashion of dealing with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBehind the Speaker's Chair hangs a large bag. In this a petition may\r\nbe placed, at any time during a sitting, by the member in charge of\r\nit. Thence it is sent to the Committee on Public Petitions, and\r\npresumably never heard of again. Petitions sometimes contain so many\r\nsignatures, and are consequently so bulky, that no earthly bag could\r\npossibly contain them. In 1890, for instance, a petition eight miles\r\nin length, in favour of the Local Taxation Bill, was presented to\r\nParliament, and in 1908 another, almost as voluminous, provided a\r\nmaterial protest against the Licensing Bill. Petitions of such\r\nproportions are carried into the House on the shoulders of stout\r\nofficials, and, after reposing for a brief space upon the floor, are\r\npresently borne away to be no more seen or remembered.\r\n\r\nWhen petitions have been disposed of, motions for unopposed returns\r\nare taken, and other formal business; and then follows question-time,\r\nperhaps one of the most important hours of the parliamentary day,\r\nwhen a hitherto languid House begins to take some interest in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nPoliticians would appear to be among the most inquisitive individuals\r\non the face of the globe; their thirst for general information is as\r\ninsatiable as it is amazing. The time spent by various Government\r\nofficials in pandering to this craving for knowledge on the part of\r\nlegislators is very considerable: it has even been hinted that the\r\nclerks at the Irish Office are employed exclusively upon the task of\r\nanswering conundrums set by members of the House of Commons. Nothing\r\nis too insignificant, no matter is too sacred, to be made the subject\r\nof a question in the House. But, although any member has a perfect\r\nright to apply for a return, or to ask any question he pleases, within\r\ncertain bounds, a Minister of the Crown may always refuse to supply\r\nthe return, or decline to answer the question; nor need he give any\r\nreason for so doing. This rule provides a loophole for a Minister who\r\nis confronted with an awkward question to which it would need the\r\npowers of subtlety and casuistry of a Gladstone to find a\r\nnon-committal reply.[389]\r\n\r\n  [389] When during Garibaldi's visit to London, some one suggested that\r\n  he should marry a wealthy widow with whom he spent much of his time it\r\n  was objected that he already had a wife living. \"Never mind,\" said a\r\n  wag, \"we will get Gladstone to explain her away!\"\r\n\r\nA member of Lord Aberdeen's Ministry in 1854 was attacked for not\r\nrendering a certain return that had been applied for. He made no\r\ncomment at the time, but on a subsequent occasion produced and laid on\r\nthe Table of the House a huge folio volume weighing 1388 lbs. and\r\ncontaining seventy-two reams of foolscap. The compilation of this\r\nreturn, as he informed the House, had caused the dispatch of 34,500\r\ncircular letters and the cataloguing and tabulating of 34,500 replies.\r\nThe result of the figures mentioned therein had not been arrived at,\r\nthe Minister went on to explain, as it would have taken two clerks a\r\nwhole year to add them up. Further, he added, the return, if\r\ncompleted, would afford no information beyond that which the House\r\nalready possessed.[390]\r\n\r\n  [390] Palgrave's \"House of Commons,\" p. 41.\r\n\r\nEver since 1902, a written instead of an oral reply can be rendered to\r\nall questions that are not marked with an asterisk by the member who\r\nasks them. No questions may be asked after a certain hour, and the\r\nanswers to those that have not been reached at that hour, as well as\r\nto those that are not marked with an asterisk, are printed and\r\ncirculated, thus saving a great deal of valuable time.\r\n\r\nQuestions must be brief and relevant. No member may ask an excessive\r\nor unreasonable number, nor may he couch them in lengthy terms. They\r\nmay not be framed argumentatively nor contain personal charges against\r\nindividuals. The Speaker is empowered to disallow any question if he\r\nthinks fit, and often interposes to check supplementary questions\r\nwhich are not relevant, or which constitute an abuse of the right to\r\ninterrogate Ministers; and the latter are always at liberty to refuse\r\nan answer on the grounds that a reply would be contrary to the public\r\ninterest. Whenever our relations with foreign Powers are in any way\r\nstrained, certain members seem to take a delight in asking questions\r\ncalculated to hamper the movements of the Foreign Office, or to\r\nprovide other nations with all the secret information they desire. And\r\nit is not always expedient or easy for Ministers to refuse to satisfy\r\nthe thirst for knowledge of their friends or opponents, or to try and\r\nchoke off the inquisitive or importunate with evasive answers. It was\r\nalways said that \"Darby Griffith destroyed Lord Palmerston's first\r\nGovernment,\" by asking perpetual questions which the Premier answered\r\nwith a \"cheerful impertinence which hurt his parliamentary\r\npower.\"[391] And the amount of patience and tact displayed by modern\r\nMinisters in replying to frivolous or petty queries is always a\r\nsubject of admiration to the stranger.\r\n\r\n  [391] Bagehot's \"English Constitution,\" p. 181.\r\n\r\nMembers no doubt feel it their duty to provide their constituencies\r\nwith some material evidence of their parliamentary labours, and no\r\neasier method can be imagined than the asking of questions on subjects\r\nin which they possibly take not the slightest interest. Some\r\npoliticians openly confess that their secretaries have orders to make\r\nout a regular weekly list of conundrums which they can hurl at the\r\nheads of unoffending Ministers, with no other purpose than that of\r\nshowing their constituents that they are taking an active interest in\r\nthe affairs of the nation. The criticism made by a parliamentary\r\nwriter fifty years ago is equally applicable to-day. \"It would seem to\r\nbe the chief amusement of some members diligently to read the\r\nnewspapers in the morning, and to ask Ministers of State in the\r\nafternoon if they have read them too, and what they think of\r\nthem.\"[392]\r\n\r\n  [392] \"Edinburgh Review,\" January, 1854, p. 254.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this yearning for information is very clearly shown by a\r\nglance at the parliamentary statistics for the last hundred years. In\r\n1800 not a single question was put during the whole of one session. In\r\n1846 the number of questions asked with due notice was sixty-nine. In\r\n1850 the number had risen to 212, in 1888 to 5000; in 1901 over 7000\r\nquestions were put, and to-day the number is still steadily\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock, or earlier if questions have been disposed of, the\r\nHouse proceeds to the consideration of its public business and the\r\n\"orders of the day,\" and the real business of Parliament begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENT AT WORK (II)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern system of legislating by Bill and Statute dates from the\r\nreign of Henry VI. In earlier days legislation was effected by means\r\nof humble petitions presented to the Crown by the Commons, and granted\r\nor refused according as the King thought fit.\r\n\r\nEvery Act of Parliament commences its existence in the shape of a\r\nBill. As such, it may be introduced in either House, though the\r\nCommons have the undoubted monopoly of initiating financial measures,\r\nand Bills for the restitution of honours and blood must originate with\r\nthe Lords. In the Upper House, any peer may introduce a Bill without\r\nnotice, but in the Commons a member must give notice of his intention\r\neither to present a measure or move for leave to do so. A Bill whose\r\nmain object is to impose a charge upon the public revenue must first\r\nbe authorized by a resolution of a Committee of the Whole House.\r\n\r\nBills may be roughly classified under the two headings of Public and\r\nPrivate, according as they affect the general interest or are framed\r\nfor the benefit of individuals or groups of individuals, though there\r\nalso exist hybrid Bills which cannot be rightly placed in either\r\ncategory. But whatever their nature, Bills must pass through five\r\nsuccessive stages. In the House of Lords, however, the Committee and\r\nReport stages are occasionally negatived in the case of Money Bills,\r\nand the Committee stage of Private Bills is conducted outside the\r\nHouse either before the Chairman of Committees or, in case of\r\nopposition, by a Select Committee of the House.\r\n\r\nIn ancient days the proceedings were not so lengthy as they afterwards\r\nbecame, a Bill being sometimes read three times and passed in a single\r\nday;[393] but nowadays the passage through Parliament of a\r\nControversial Bill is a tedious affair.\r\n\r\n  [393] Hakewell's \"Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,\" p. 142.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient for the purposes of this chapter to take the\r\nexample of a Public Bill introduced in the House of Commons, and\r\nfollow it from its embryonic state along the course of its career\r\nuntil, as an Act of Parliament, it finally takes its place in the\r\nstatute-book of the land.\r\n\r\nBy obtaining the permission of the House, a Member of Parliament may\r\nbring in a Bill upon any conceivable subject, but it is not always\r\npossible for him to find the necessary opportunity for doing so,\r\nunless he happens to be exceptionally favoured by fortune.[394] In\r\nthese days, when the time at the disposal of Parliament is altogether\r\ninadequate to the demands made upon it by legislation, the chances of\r\npassing a Bill without the support of the Government are for a private\r\nmember extremely small. Even with official assistance this is not\r\nalways an easy matter. It is perhaps as well that the passion for\r\nlegislation latent in the bosom of every politician should to some\r\nextent be curbed. George II. said to Lord Waldegrave that Parliament\r\npassed nearly a hundred laws every session, which seemed made for no\r\nother purpose than to afford people the pleasure of breaking them, and\r\nhis opinion that the less legislation effected by Parliament the\r\nbetter for the country is still popular in many quarters.[395]\r\n\r\n  [394] Bills of the most fantastic kind are from time to time\r\n  introduced, though they seldom see the light of a Second Reading. In\r\n  1597 a member, Walgrave by name, brought in a Bill to prevent the\r\n  exportation of herrings to Leghorn, \"which occasioneth both a very\r\n  great scarcity of Herrings within the Realm and is a great means of\r\n  spending much Butter and Cheese, to the great inhancing of the prices\r\n  thereof by reason of the said scarcity of Herrings.\"--D'Ewes'\r\n  \"Journal,\" p. 562.\r\n\r\n  [395] Lord Waldegrave's \"Memoirs,\" p. 133.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of every session the question of the priority of\r\nmembers' claims to introduce Bills and motions is decided by ballot.\r\n\r\nA member who is lucky, and has, if necessary, obtained the leave of\r\nthe House, can introduce his Bill briefly and without debate. Taking\r\nhis stand at the bar, he awaits the summons of the Speaker, when,\r\nadvancing to the Table, he hands to the Clerk a \"dummy\" on which the\r\ntitle of the Bill is written. This the Clerk proceeds to read to the\r\nHouse. The Bill is then considered to have been read a first time, and\r\nordered to be printed, and a day is fixed for the Second Reading.\r\n\r\nThe First Reading is looked upon as a mere matter of form, and rarely\r\nopposed.[396] It is on the Second Reading, when the principle of the\r\nBill is by way of being discussed, that any real antagonism begins to\r\nmake itself felt. Opponents may negative the motion that the Bill be\r\n_now_ read a second time--in which case the motion may be repeated\r\nanother day--or may adopt the more usual and polite method of moving\r\nthat the Bill be read \"this day six (or three) months\"--the intention\r\nbeing to destroy the Bill by postponing the Second Reading until after\r\nthe prorogation of Parliament. No Bill or motion on which the House\r\nhas given such a decision may be brought up again during the same\r\nsession, so that a postponement of the reading is merely a courteous\r\nway of shelving it altogether.[397]\r\n\r\n  [396] In June, 1835, however, a Mr. Fox Maule was refused permission\r\n  to bring in a Bill \"for the better protection of tenants' crops in\r\n  Scotland from the ravages committed on them by several kinds of\r\n  game.\"--Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 38.\r\n\r\n  [397] Our ancestors were not always so well-mannered in their methods.\r\n  Once when a Bill had been returned to them from the Lords with an\r\n  amendment to a money clause, they expressed their active disapproval\r\n  by literally kicking it along the floor of the House, and so out at\r\n  the door. \"Parl. Hist.,\" vol. xvii. p. 515.\r\n\r\nA Bill that has successfully weathered a Second Reading stands\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the Whole House, unless the House, on\r\nmotion, resolves that it be referred to some other kind of Committee,\r\nviz., a Grand Committee, a Select Committee, or a Joint Committee of\r\nboth Houses.\r\n\r\nWhen the House is to resolve itself into Committee a motion to that\r\neffect is made in the Lords, to which an amendment may be moved; in\r\nthe Commons the Speaker leaves the chair, and the Chairman of\r\nCommittees at once presides, sitting in the Clerk's chair at the\r\nTable. The Bill is then discussed clause by clause, and any number of\r\namendments may be proposed to each line, and any number of speeches\r\nmade by any member on each amendment. No limit is set to the number of\r\namendments that may be moved, provided they are relevant and\r\nconsistent with the policy of the Bill. This is therefore by far the\r\nmost lengthy stage of the Bill, and it was in order to accelerate the\r\nprogress of business that, in 1883, Standing Committees, consisting of\r\nfrom sixty to eighty members, were created to which Bills relating to\r\nLaw and Trade were to be referred instead of to the Committee of the\r\nWhole House.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bill has passed through the Committee stage, it is reported\r\nto the House with or without amendments. In the former case, a day is\r\nfixed for the discussion of its altered shape, and on this \"Report\"\r\nstage further amendments may be made. At the Third Reading a Bill may\r\nstill be rejected, or postponed \"for six months,\" or re-committed, but\r\nin the Commons no material amendments may be made to it. This stage is\r\nusually taken at once after the Report; but in the Lords the two\r\nstages must be on different days, and amendments may be made after due\r\nnotice on the Third Reading.\r\n\r\nWhen a Bill has safely passed all its stages in the Lower House, the\r\nClerk of the Commons attaches to it a polite message in\r\nNorman-French--\"soit baillé aux seigneurs\"--and hands it to his\r\ncolleague in the Lords. The latter lays it on the Table of the Upper\r\nHouse, where it lies until taken up by some peer--which must be done\r\nwithin twelve sitting days, if the Bill is not to be lost (though it\r\nmay be raised from the dead by notice of a motion to revive it of the\r\nsame duration)--when its subsequent treatment, with the few\r\ndifferences noted above, is very similar to that which it has already\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PASSING OF THE REFORM BILL IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\nFROM AN ENGRAVING AFTER THE PAINTING BY SIR J. REYNOLDS]\r\n\r\nShould the Lords pass a Bill as it stands, a message to that effect is\r\nsent to the Commons. If, however, they have made alterations, the\r\nClerk of the Parliaments writes, \"A ceste bille avesque des amendemens\r\nles seignieurs sont assentus\" across it, and returns it to the Clerk\r\nof the other House.[398] The Commons then proceed to consider the\r\nLords' amendments on some future day. If the two Houses cannot agree,\r\nthey must either summon a Conference--nowadays an unusual step to\r\ntake[399]--or a Select Committee of the dissenting House sends a\r\nspecially prepared message to the other Chamber, explaining the\r\nreasons for its disagreement. Numerous messages may pass in this way,\r\nfor the purpose of coming to an agreement; but if they fail, the Bill\r\nis lost for the Session.\r\n\r\n  [398] It may be observed that among the many traditionary differences\r\n  of opinion entertained by the two Houses is a divergence as to the\r\n  proper spelling of the word \"seigneurs.\"\r\n\r\n  [399] A Conference of both Houses has not been held since 1836.\r\n\r\nWhen a Bill has passed both Houses, nothing remains but to give it the\r\nRoyal Assent, which is done by the Clerk of the Parliaments.[400]\r\n\r\n  [400] The Clerkship of the Parliaments is an ancient office, dating\r\n  from the commencement of the fourteenth century. It was originally\r\n  held by an ecclesiastic, to whom were assigned, in times when the two\r\n  Houses sat together, the clerical work of Parliament. The Clerk of the\r\n  Parliaments is appointed by the Crown under Letters Patent, and can\r\n  only be removed by the Crown on an address from the House of Lords. Up\r\n  to the year 1855, the post was a lucrative sinecure, worth about £7000\r\n  a year, the actual duties of the office being performed by the Clerk\r\n  Assistant. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Clerk of\r\n  the Parliaments enjoyed the privilege of nominating and appointing all\r\n  the clerks on the House of Lords establishment, but in 1824 the\r\n  appointment of the two other Clerks at the Table was transferred to\r\n  the Lord Chancellor. He still, however, appoints all the other clerks,\r\n  regulates and controls the duties and promotion of the staff, appoints\r\n  the Librarian and his assistant, and exercises superintendence over\r\n  the Library and the Refreshment Department of the House. It is his\r\n  duty to attend all the sittings of the House, to call on the Orders of\r\n  the Day, and to invite peers to bring forward their Bills or Motions.\r\n  He also performs functions analogous to those of the Speaker in the\r\n  Commons, when he signs Addresses to the sovereign, other Addresses of\r\n  thanks or condolence, the minutes of the daily proceedings, and all\r\n  the returns ordered by the House. As registrar of the Court of Final\r\n  Appeal, he takes the instructions of the judicial authorities upon all\r\n  questions relating to appeals, and keeps a record of all judgments,\r\n  etc. Lastly, and this is perhaps not the least important of his\r\n  duties, he gives the Royal Assent to Bills.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Assent is nowadays a mere formality--a final ceremonial\r\nwhich marks the last stage of a Bill's progress ere it becomes law. It\r\nis usually given by the Lords Commissioners, who act as\r\nrepresentatives of the Crown, though there is nothing to prevent a\r\nsovereign from performing this duty himself. On August 2, 1831, when\r\nthe Bill making separate financial provision for Queen Adelaide\r\nreceived the Royal Assent, both the King and Queen attended in\r\nParliament, and the latter acknowledged her indebtedness by bowing\r\nthrice, presumably to King, Lords and Commons. As a rule, however, the\r\nsovereign is not present on these occasions, his place being taken by\r\na Commission. This consists of the Lord Chancellor and two other\r\nLords, who take their seats, prior to the ceremony, upon a form placed\r\nbetween the Throne and the Woolsack. The Gentleman Usher of the Black\r\nRod is then commanded to summon the faithful Commons, and, on the\r\narrival of the latter at the bar of the Lords, the titles of the\r\nvarious Bills are read aloud by the Clerk of the Crown, and the Royal\r\nAssent is given by the Clerk of the Parliaments in old-fashioned\r\nNorman-French. In the case of a Money Bill, brought up by the Speaker\r\nof the Commons, and received by the Clerk of the Parliaments, who\r\nbears it to the Table bowing, the formula runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Le Roi remerçie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi\r\nle veult.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of a Public or Private Bill, the respective phrases, \"Le\r\nRoi le veult\" or \"Soit fait comme il est désiré\" are substituted,\r\nthough, as a matter of practice, the latter phrase is only used for\r\nEstate, Naturalisation and Divorce Bills.\r\n\r\nIn olden days, when the Crown was often in the habit of refusing to\r\nconsent to the passing of particular Bills, the words used by the\r\nClerk of the Parliaments to signify the royal veto were \"Le Roi\r\ns'avisera.\" In this way Queen Elizabeth quashed no less than\r\nforty-eight Bills that had passed through Parliament, and William III.\r\nsimilarly declined to assent to the Parliamentary Proceedings Bill of\r\n1693, much to the annoyance of the Commons. But never since Queen Anne\r\nvetoed the Scotch Militia Bill, in 1707, has any sovereign refused the\r\nRoyal Assent.\r\n\r\nAll questions before Parliament are decided by the voice of the\r\nmajority. And though, as Gladstone once said, decision by majorities\r\nmay be as much an expedient as lighting by gas, it is an expedient\r\nthat answers very well in practice, and for which an effective\r\nsubstitute has yet to be found. Majority may sometimes seem a clumsy\r\nargument, but it always remains \"the best repartee.\"\r\n\r\nThe procedure in either House for ascertaining the general opinion\r\nupon any measure or motion differs but slightly in form, and not at\r\nall in principle. At the end of every debate the question under\r\ndiscussion is laid before the House by its Speaker or Chairman. This\r\nhe does by rising in his place and saying, \"The question is that ...\"\r\n(here follows the exact words of the motion). \"As many as are of that\r\nopinion say 'Aye!'; as many as are of the contrary opinion say 'No!'\"\r\n(In the Lords the words \"Content\" and \"Not Content\" are substituted\r\nfor \"Aye\" and \"No.\") Members or peers thereupon express their views in\r\nthe required manner, and the Speaker (or Chairman), gathering what is\r\ncalled the \"sense of the House\" by the volume of sound proceeding from\r\neither party, says, \"I think the Ayes (or Noes)\"--or, in the Lords\r\n\"the Contents\" or \"Not Contents\"--\"have it!\"\r\n\r\nIf the judgment of the Chair be unchallenged, the question is deemed\r\nto be resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be, and\r\nnothing further remains to be done. Should, however, either party\r\nquestion the correctness of the Chairman's opinion, recourse is had to\r\na division, and certain necessary formalities have to be observed\r\nbefore the matter is definitely settled one way or the other.\r\n\r\nWhen a division is challenged in the House of Commons, the Speaker (or\r\nChairman) orders the Sergeant-at-Arms to \"Clear the lobby,\" and the\r\ntellers' doors leading from the lobbies, as well as the door leading\r\nfrom the Central Hall, are immediately locked. After the lapse of two\r\nminutes, during which the loud division-bells are set ringing all over\r\nthe building to summon breathless members to the Chamber, the question\r\nis again put from the Chair. If once more challenged, the Speaker\r\nnames two members of either party to act as \"tellers.\" Should no one\r\nbe found willing to undertake this duty, a division cannot take place,\r\nand the Speaker declares that the \"Noes\" have it. If, however, tellers\r\nare duly appointed, they take their place at the exit doors leading\r\nfrom the two lobbies, which are now unlocked. After another interval,\r\nthis time of four minutes' duration, the doors leading from the House\r\nto the lobbies are locked. Meanwhile, all members who wish to vote\r\nhave left the Chamber, and are streaming through their respective\r\nlobbies, where their names are recorded by clerks, while the tellers\r\ncount them as they pass through the lobby doors.\r\n\r\nIn the old days of St Stephen's Chapel, the \"Ayes\" used to remain in\r\nthe House, while the \"Noes\" withdrew, and were counted on their\r\nreturn. This practice led to endless difficulties, many members\r\nrefusing to go out for fear of losing their seats, while others were\r\nforcibly detained by their friends. In Elizabeth's time, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh admitted that he often held a fellow-member by his sleeve, and\r\nothers were accused of pulling each other back, as Cecil said, \"like a\r\ndog on a string.\"[401] Later on, it was decided that members who gave\r\ntheir votes for the introduction of \"any new matter\" should alone\r\nwithdraw, while the votes of those who remained behind were recorded.\r\nThis system also had its disadvantages. In 1834, for instance, when a\r\ncertain Whig member, Colonel Evans, fell asleep in one of the side\r\ngalleries during a division, he woke to find that he had been counted\r\namong the Tories, much to his disgust. Finally, two years later, the\r\npractice of clearing the House altogether for a division was first\r\ninstituted, and continued in force until the establishment of the\r\nmodern method in 1906.[402]\r\n\r\n  [401] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 683, and Townshend's \"Proceedings of\r\n  Parliament,\" p. 322.\r\n\r\n  [402] In 1810, another system was temporarily introduced, the members\r\n  ranging themselves on either side of the House and being counted by\r\n  the tellers. Croker, when Ministerial teller, once accidentally missed\r\n  out a whole bench full of Government supporters, thereby reducing the\r\n  Ministerial majority by about forty. The Opposition teller watched the\r\n  error with a smile, but did not feel called upon to correct it. See\r\n  \"The Observer,\" March 11, 1810.\r\n\r\nWhen all members who desire to vote have filed through the lobbies,\r\nand are once more reassembled in the House, the four tellers advance\r\ntogether to the Table. The senior teller of the party having a\r\nmajority, walks on the right, bearing in his hand a slip of paper, on\r\nwhich are written the numbers of the division. By the position of the\r\nteller it is thus possible to gauge the result of a division before it\r\nhas been officially announced, and his advance to the Table in the\r\nplace of honour is usually the signal for an outburst of cheering from\r\nhis own victorious party. He proceeds to report the result of the\r\ndivision to the Clerk at the Table, who writes the numbers on a piece\r\nof paper, which he hands back to him. This the teller passes to the\r\nSpeaker, who, in turn, announces the numbers to the House. The doors\r\nare then unlocked, and the division is at an end.\r\n\r\nOn one famous occasion the tellers failed to agree in their reports of\r\nthe figures. This happened on May 10, 1675, when the House in\r\nCommittee had divided on a motion with regard to the English regiments\r\nserving in the French army. The tellers' difference of opinion gave\r\nrise to a scene of great confusion, during which one member spat in\r\nanother's face, and a free fight would probably have ensued but for\r\nthe sudden arrival of the Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe amount of time spent in dividing has always been a source of\r\nannoyance to earnest politicians, more especially when divisions are\r\nmade use of as a recognised form of obstruction, and the progress of\r\nparliamentary business thereby much impeded. In 1902, to name a recent\r\nexample, the opponents of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which had\r\nalready passed a Second Reading, deliberately walked so slowly through\r\nthe lobbies during four divisions that there was no time left to move\r\nthat it should be sent to a Grand Committee. Members naturally grudge\r\nthe precious hours wasted in trudging through the lobbies; but it\r\nseems impossible to invent any scheme that shall further expedite\r\nmatters, the present system being apparently as perfect as the mind of\r\nman can devise.[403]\r\n\r\n  [403] In the Session of 1881 the number of divisions was about 400; in\r\n  1908, including the autumn Session, the number was 463, and in 1909\r\n  the House of Commons divided 918 times.\r\n\r\nWhen a division is called in the House of Lords, the procedure is very\r\nsimilar in character to that of the Commons. The Chancellor (or Lord\r\non the Woolsack) orders strangers to withdraw by saying, \"Clear the\r\nbar!\" and the Clerk of the Parliaments thereupon turns a two-minute\r\nsand-glass.\r\n\r\nWhen the sand has run out of the glass, the doors are locked, and the\r\nquestion is once more put to the House. If the Lord Chancellor's\r\ndecision is challenged he at once says, \"the 'Contents' will go to the\r\nright by the Throne, and the 'Not Contents' to the left by the bar.\"\r\nEach party then passes through its own lobby, the \"Contents\"\r\nre-entering the House on the right of the bar, the \"Not Contents\"\r\nthrough the door on the left of the Throne, their votes being duly\r\nrecorded by clerks in the lobbies. The subsequent procedure resembles\r\nthat in vogue in the Lower House.\r\n\r\nUntil 1857, when the present system was adopted, the \"Contents\"\r\nremained within the bar, while the \"Not Contents\" went below the bar.\r\nPeers, who through infirmity, or other causes, are disabled from\r\nleaving the House, may by its permission be \"told\" in their seats, and\r\nthose who do not wish to vote at all are allowed to go within the\r\nrailings on the steps of the Throne.\r\n\r\nIn old days the practice of voting by proxy was habitual in the House\r\nof Lords. During the reign of Edward I., nobles who were unable to\r\nattend in person invariably sent messengers to act for them. Peers\r\nwere permitted to appoint any individuals to represent them, either\r\npermanently or on special occasions, and, up to the fifteenth century,\r\nthese proxies did not even have to be peers themselves. In the time of\r\nHenry VIII. the custom of allowing peers to represent one another was\r\nfirst instituted, and in Charles I.'s day we find the Duke of\r\nBuckingham holding no less than fourteen proxies. Such a custom\r\nnaturally led to many abuses, and an order was eventually passed\r\nforbidding any peer to hold more than two proxies. Finally, in 1868,\r\nthe House of Lords realised that the practice was reprehensible, and\r\npassed a Standing Order whereby the system of calling for proxies on a\r\ndivision was discontinued.\r\n\r\nTo-day, peers are in some ways even more particular than their\r\ncolleagues in the Commons, and do not allow any one of their number to\r\ntake part in a division unless he has himself been in the House when\r\nthe question was put. In other respects they enjoy a wider latitude.\r\nIf a lord occasionally strays into the wrong lobby, he may refuse to\r\nbe counted by the tellers, and his vote may afterwards be recorded as\r\nhe desires. A member of the House of Commons who commits a like\r\nindiscretion is required to bear the consequences, and can neither\r\nalter nor rescind his vote.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an equal number of votes being recorded on either side\r\nin a division the procedure differs in the two Houses. In the Lords\r\nthe question is invariably resolved in the negative, in accordance\r\nwith the ancient rule of the Law: \"semper præsumitur pro negante.\" In\r\nthe Commons the Speaker has to decide it by a casting vote, which he\r\ngenerally gives in such a manner as to leave the question open for\r\nanother division. This, however, is not always an easy task; indeed,\r\nit is often a most invidious and unpleasant one. In April, 1805,\r\nSpeaker Abbot was compelled to give a casting-vote on the resolution\r\nleading to the impeachment of Lord Melville. After ten minutes'\r\ndistressing hesitation, while the House remained in a state of\r\nagonized suspense, Abbot reluctantly gave his vote against Lord\r\nMelville, and thus secured the defeat of Pitt.[404]\r\n\r\n  [404] Only fifteen ties are known in the history of Parliament On\r\n  April 3, 1905, Speaker Gully gave a casting vote on the Embankment\r\n  Tramways Bill, as did Speaker Lowther, on July 22, 1910, on the\r\n  Regency Bill.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means the only instance of a momentous question such as\r\nthe life of a Government being decided by a single vote. The Second\r\nReading of the Reform Bill in 1831 was carried by a majority of one;\r\nthe House on that occasion presenting a sight which, as Macaulay said,\r\nwas to be seen only once and never to be forgotten. \"It was like\r\nseeing Cæsar stabbed in the Senate House, or seeing Oliver taking the\r\nmace from the Table.\" When the tellers announced the majority the\r\nvictorious party shouted with joy, while some of them actually shed\r\ntears. \"The jaw of Peel fell; and the face of Twiss was as the face of\r\na damned soul; and Herries looked like Judas taking his necktie off\r\nfor the last operation.\" In 1854 Lord Russell was defeated and Sir\r\nRobert Peel returned to victory on the crest of an equally diminutive\r\nwave; and a century earlier Walpole's administration was overthrown by\r\na small majority of three.\r\n\r\nA minority of one is more unusual, but not altogether unknown. At the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, when the Duke of Somerset divided the\r\nHouse of Lords on a question of war with France, he walked alone into\r\nthe Opposition division lobby. The same fate befell Dr. Kenealy in\r\n1875, when his motion on behalf of the Tichborne Claimant was defeated\r\nby 433 votes to 1. On July 16, 1909, when a division was taken on an\r\namendment to reject a Bill prohibiting foreign trawlers from landing\r\ntheir catches at British ports, the Noes numbered 158 while there was\r\nbut a solitary Aye. And on July 18, 1910, on a motion for the\r\nadjournment of the House, there was but a single No.\r\n\r\nNo secrecy is maintained as to the voting of peers or members in\r\ndivisions. In the old Journals of the Lords the division lists used\r\nalways to be entered, but in 1641 this practice was abandoned, and the\r\nminority could only record an adverse vote by a formal protest of\r\ndissent.[405] Division lists were not regularly printed in the Commons\r\nuntil 1836, and the Lords followed suit about twenty years later.\r\n\r\n  [405] This right of protest recorded in the Journals of the House is\r\n  still occasionally exercised.\r\n\r\nDivisions provide legislators with plenty of exercise, combined\r\noccasionally with acute mental anxiety. The latter they share with\r\nthose hardworked and hardworking individuals, the \"Whips\" or\r\n\"Whippers-in,\" whose duties are at all times heavy and become\r\nespecially onerous with the approach of a division.\r\n\r\nThese Whips, who are four in number--two representing the Government,\r\ntwo the Opposition--have rooms provided for them in the Lobby, and\r\nhold positions of the utmost responsibility and influence. In the\r\nHouse of Commons the office of principal Government Whip is one of\r\nimmense importance and requires, as Disraeli said, \"consummate\r\nknowledge of human nature, the most amiable flexibility, and complete\r\nself-control.\"[406] As Patronage Secretary to the Treasury, with a\r\nsalary of £2000 a year, he is the descendant of that official,\r\nsometimes known as the \"Secretary for Political Jobs,\" who in former\r\ntimes bought members, their votes and constituencies, and disposed of\r\nthe Government secret service money to obtain (and retain) a majority\r\nfor the party in power.\r\n\r\n  [406] \"Life of Lord George Bentinck,\" p. 314.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Whip is generally assisted by two of the Junior Lords of the\r\nTreasury, and, in conjunction with the Opposition Whips, arranges all\r\nthe details of the sessional campaign. On the occasion of important\r\ndebates the Whips conspire to choke off any garrulous nonentities who\r\nmay wish to make their voices heard, and practically arrange a list of\r\nthe influential speakers on both sides in the order in which they are\r\nto address the House. At such a time the Speaker's eye may almost be\r\nsaid to be a party to the conspiracy, though never yielding its\r\ndiscretion to be caught by members whose names are not upon the Whips'\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nTact, good temper and unceasing vigilance are virtues necessary to\r\nWhips. They must combine the discretion of the diplomatist with the\r\nacumen of the sleuth-hound. It is their business to smooth the ruffled\r\nfeathers of any members who consider themselves aggrieved, to listen\r\npatiently to the bores, to suffer the fools gladly. They are expected\r\nto ascertain the \"sense\" of the House upon all important questions,\r\neither by instinct, by worming their way into the confidence of\r\nmembers, or by secret detective work in the Smoking Room. They must\r\nkeep their leader informed of their discoveries, and thus guard the\r\nparty against any sudden unexpected attack. If necessary they act as\r\nemissaries or ambassadors between the party heads, arranging an\r\noccasional compromise or deciding what particular questions shall be\r\ndiscussed in an uncontroversial spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Whips have been called the autocrats of the House of Commons, but\r\nthough they rule individual members with an iron hand, it must ever be\r\ntheir desire to keep their party contented and happy and harmonious.\r\nWhen a private member is very anxious to escape from the House for a\r\nholiday it is to the Whip he applies for permission. If possible he\r\n\"pairs\" with some member on the other side who is equally desirous of\r\nescaping. At the door of the House lies a book in which members\r\n\"pairing\" with one another inscribe their names, and it is one of the\r\nWhips' duties to arrange these \"pairs,\" and, above all, to see that no\r\nmember gets away unpaired.\r\n\r\nAt a time when a ticklish division is expected, when the majority on\r\neither side is uncertain, the Whips are stimulated to herculean\r\nlabours. Threats, entreaties, cajoleries, all must be employed to\r\nbring members up to the scratch. The waverers must be secured, the\r\ndoubtful reassured. Nothing can be left undone to ensure that every\r\navailable member shall be in his place when the decisive moment\r\narrives. The byways and hedges are scoured for absentees, who are\r\nbesought to return at once to Westminster to record their votes and\r\nperhaps save their party from defeat.\r\n\r\nWhen Pulteney, whom Macaulay considered the greatest leader of the\r\nOpposition that the House of Commons had ever seen, gathered his\r\nforces in 1742 to overthrow Walpole, the Opposition left no stone\r\nunturned to ensure a majority. They collected every man of the party,\r\nno matter what excuses he put forward. One was brought into the House\r\nin a dying condition, but contrived to defer his impending dissolution\r\nuntil he had recorded his valuable vote. Both sides produced a number\r\nof incurables, and the House looked (as Ewald says) more like the Pool\r\nof Bethesda than a legislative assembly. The Prince of Wales was an\r\ninterested spectator of the scene. \"I see,\" he remarked to General\r\nChurchill, \"you bring in the lame, the halt and the blind!\" \"Yes,\"\r\nreplied the General, \"the lame on our side, the blind on yours!\"[407]\r\n\r\n  [407] Ewald's \"Biography of Walpole,\" p. 419.\r\n\r\nA similar scene took place in 1866 when the Russell-Gladstone Cabinet\r\nwas defeated over the Reform Bill. The Whips had achieved wonders in\r\ncollecting their flocks together; they had haled to Westminster the\r\nsick, the senile, the decrepit, the doting and the moribund. The grave\r\nalone seems to have been sacred from their ravages. Some of the\r\nmembers, as we read in a contemporary account, \"had been wooed from\r\nthe prostration of their couches; one had been taken from the delights\r\nof his marriage-trip; and several from the bedsides of relatives in\r\nextremity.\"[408]\r\n\r\n  [408] \"Chambers' Journal,\" December 26, 1886, p. 819.\r\n\r\nTo be able to accomplish such feats the Whips must be well acquainted\r\nwith the habits and haunts of the individuals beneath their charge, so\r\nthat at any moment of the day or night they may send a telegram or a\r\nmessage to an absentee whose presence is urgently required. Pepys in\r\nhis Diary (December 8, 1666) describes how the King gave an order \"to\r\nmy Lord Chamberlain to send to the playhouses and brothels, to bid\r\nall the Parliament-men that were there to go to the Parliament\r\npresently,\" to vote against some Bill of which he disapproved. The\r\nmodern Whip in like manner must be ready at any moment to despatch an\r\nurgent summons to the Opera, to the Clubs, to houses where parties are\r\nbeing given, recalling members to their parliamentary duties. And in\r\ndoing so he must exercise the greatest possible tact. The wife of a\r\nmuch respected member of Parliament was sleeping peacefully in her bed\r\none night when a frantic message arrived from the party Whip imploring\r\nher husband to come at once to Westminster. She remembered that her\r\nspouse had informed her that he would probably be kept at the House\r\nuntil late and had begged her not to sit up. Inspired with horrible\r\nsuspicions of conjugal perfidy, the good lady rose in haste and\r\nhurried down to the House of Commons to confirm them. As a matter of\r\nfact her husband had never left the precincts of Parliament, and the\r\nWhip's message had been despatched in error. The member was therefore\r\nmuch surprised at the sudden appearance of his wife upon the scene.\r\nHis attachment to home and duty had been equally unimpaired, and he\r\nreceived her explanation somewhat coldly.\r\n\r\nA notice, more or less heavily underlined, is sent to each member of\r\nParliament every morning, apprising him of the business of the day's\r\nsitting and of the necessity for his presence in the House. These\r\n\"whips,\" as they are called, were in vogue as long ago as the year\r\n1621, when, Porritt tells us, notices underlined six times were sent\r\nto the King's friends.[409] The urgency of the summons can be gauged\r\nby the number of underlines, and a \"whip\" that is underlined three\r\ntimes can only be ignored at the peril of the member who receives\r\nit.[410]\r\n\r\n  [409] Porritt's \"Unreformed House of Commons,\" vol. i. p. 509.\r\n\r\n  [410] Until a few years ago all \"whips\" were underlined twice and in\r\n  urgent cases five times.\r\n\r\nThough the Whips seldom address the House themselves, they must on all\r\noccasions be ready to provide other speakers who shall feed the dying\r\nembers of debate with fresh fuel. At all hazards the ball must be kept\r\nrolling. Sometimes a debate shows signs of languishing in an\r\nunexpected fashion, and the Whip is horrified to find that his usual\r\nmajority has dwindled away to nothing. When this occurs he must at\r\nonce find members who are willing to talk against time while he and\r\nhis colleagues hasten round and beat up a majority. On one famous\r\noccasion within recent memory, while most of the supporters of the\r\nConservative Government were disporting themselves at Ascot on the Cup\r\nday, the Opposition prepared to spring an unexpected division upon the\r\nHouse. The situation was only saved by Mr. Chaplin, who spoke for\r\nseveral hours, in spite of the howls of his opponents, while a special\r\ntrain was bringing absentees from the racecourse to the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the Whip's duty, not only to \"make\" a House and to \"keep\"\r\na House, but also, like Sidmouth's sycophantic relatives, to \"cheer\r\nthe Minister.\" To quote the lines of Canning--\r\n\r\n    \"When the faltering periods lag,\r\n      Or the House receives them drily,\r\n    Cheer, oh, cheer him, Brother Bragge;\r\n      Cheer, oh, cheer him, Brother Riley!\r\n\r\n    \"Brother Bragge and Brother Riley,\r\n      Cheer him! when he speaks so vilely,\r\n    Cheer him! when his audience flag,\r\n      Brother Riley, Brother Bragge!\"[411]\r\n\r\n  [411] \"Ode to the Doctor.\" (Bragge Bathurst, Lord Sidmouth's\r\n  brother-in-law, and Riley, his brother, were place-hunters who felt\r\n  bound to applaud their patron.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSTRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTheoretically speaking, Parliament is averse to the presence of\r\nstrangers; in practice both Houses are as hospitably inclined as is\r\ncompatible with the limited space at their disposal.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms originally consisted\r\nin \"taking into custody such strangers who presume to come into the\r\nHouse of Commons.\"[412] This duty has however, long been neglected,\r\nand a modern Sergeant-at-Arms who sought to accomplish such a task\r\nwould find his hands full.\r\n\r\n  [412] House of Commons \"Journals,\" vol. x. 291.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Parliament, the most drastic measures were taken\r\nto maintain the secrecy of debate, and the intrusion of a stranger was\r\nlooked upon as a cause for grave alarm. In 1584, a man named Robinson\r\nsucceeded in obtaining admission to the Commons, and sat in the House\r\nunnoticed for two hours. When at last his presence was discovered, Mr.\r\nRobinson was roughly handled by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and, before he\r\nhad time to utter his own name, was \"stript to the shirt\" and\r\nsearched.[413] Nothing of an incriminating nature being found beneath\r\nthe intruder's clothing, he was brought to the bar, sworn to secrecy\r\nand compelled to take the Oath of Supremacy before being finally\r\nreleased with a severe reprimand. A hundred years later two\r\ninoffensive but ignorant strangers walked into the House and sat\r\nquietly down beside the Sergeant-at-Arms. Here they remained for some\r\ntime, much impressed by the hospitality of the Commons, until a\r\ndivision happened to be called. Their presence was not observed until\r\nthe lobby doors had been finally locked, and they had to be hurried\r\nout of the way by a side staircase to the Distinguished Strangers'\r\nGallery. Here they remained until the division was over, and were\r\nsubsequently dismissed with a caution. In 1771, a stranger who had\r\naccidentally mingled with the members in the lobbies was actually\r\ncounted in a division.\r\n\r\n  [413] D'Ewes' \"Journal,\" p. 334.\r\n\r\nAs time went on Parliament grew more and more tolerant of the presence\r\nof strangers, and, though the order forbidding their admission\r\nremained upon the order book of the House of Commons, it soon came to\r\nbe universally disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn the old House members would sometimes be accompanied by their sons,\r\nquite little boys, whom they would carry to their seats beside them,\r\nand strangers could always obtain a seat in the gallery by means of a\r\nwritten order given them by a member, or by the simple method of\r\nslipping half-a-crown into the hand of the attendant at the door. When\r\nC. F. Moritz, the German traveller, visited the House in 1782, he\r\nsought admission to the gallery, but, being unprovided with a pass,\r\nwas turned away. As he was sadly withdrawing he heard the attendant\r\nmurmur something of an apparently irrelevant nature concerning a\r\nbottle of rum, but not until he reached home did it occur to him that\r\nthe remark might possibly have some bearing upon the situation. The\r\nnext day, having been enlightened as to the general custom in vogue\r\namong those who wished to be present during a debate, he returned to\r\nthe gallery. He had taken the wise precaution of providing himself\r\nwith a small sum of money. This he had no difficulty in pressing upon\r\nthe door-keeper, who at once showed him into a front seat.[414] No\r\ndoubt Edmund Burke, who in his youth spent so much time listening to\r\nthe debates and gaining that Parliamentary experience which was\r\nafterwards destined to stand him in such good stead, unlocked the\r\ngallery door with the same golden key.\r\n\r\n  [414] Pinkerton's \"Voyages,\" vol. ii. p. 506.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1833 the doorkeepers and messengers of the House of\r\nCommons were paid principally in fees and gratuities. Members were\r\ncalled upon to contribute about £9 per session towards a fund raised\r\non their behalf, and they received a small nominal salary of less than\r\n£13. The doorkeepers earned farther payment by delivering the Orders\r\nand Acts of the House to members, as well as various fees from\r\nparliamentary agents, and were likewise entitled to a quarter of the\r\nstrangers' fees. In 1832 the two chief doorkeepers were making between\r\n£800 and £900 a year, and the chief messenger nearly £600. The man\r\nwhose duty it was to look after the room above the ventilator to which\r\nladies were admitted was not so successful as his colleagues, and\r\ncomplained that he only received about £10 a year in tips from the\r\nmore economical sex.[415]\r\n\r\n  [415] \"Report of the Select Committee on the Establishment of the\r\n  House of Commons\" (1833), pp. 84-5. (To-day the messengers and\r\n  doorkeepers, of whom there are about a score, earn regular salaries\r\n  ranging from £120 to £300. Except for a share in the fund for\r\n  messengers and police to which members may or may not contribute, no\r\n  gratuities of any description are allowed to them.)\r\n\r\nPearson, for over thirty years doorkeeper in the old House of Commons,\r\nwas one of the most familiar figures in and about St Stephen's Chapel\r\nduring the latter part of the eighteenth century. In his box near the\r\ngallery he sat--\r\n\r\n    \"Like a pagod in his niche;\r\n    The Gom-gom Pearson, whose sonorous lungs,\r\n    With 'Silence! Room there!' drown an hundred tongues.\"\r\n\r\nLong service had given him a position of authority of which he took\r\nevery advantage. If a member were negligent in the matter of paying\r\nthe door-keeper his fee, or treated that official in a manner which he\r\nconsidered derogatory to his dignity, Pearson revenged himself by\r\nsending the offender to the House of Lords or the Court of Requests in\r\nsearch of imaginary friends. By such means he generally reduced the\r\nirritated member to submission, and could extract a handsome present\r\nand a promise of future politeness. Pearson had his own importance so\r\nmuch at heart, as we read in his biography, that he spurned a member's\r\nmoney unless he had previously humbled the man. Long experience had\r\nenabled him to time the length of a debate or even of an individual\r\nspeech with extraordinary accuracy. Members wishing to be informed as\r\nto the probable hour of adjournment would ask him at what time the\r\nSpeaker had ordered his carriage. \"The Speaker has ordered his coach\r\nat eight,\" Pearson would reply, \"but I'll be d----d if you get away\r\nbefore twelve!\"[416]\r\n\r\n  [416] The familiar way in which Pearson addressed members seems to\r\n  have been generally condoned on account of his long service. Once when\r\n  General Grant, who had boasted that he would march victoriously\r\n  through America with three thousand men, asked the door-keeper how\r\n  long a certain member would speak, Pearson replied, \"As long, General,\r\n  if he was allowed, as you would be in marching through and conquering\r\n  America!\" Pearson's \"Political Dictionary,\" p. 10.\r\n\r\nPearson's treatment of strangers was no less autocratic. He could not\r\nalways be corrupted into finding room for them in the galleries unless\r\nhe happened to take a fancy to the appearance of the visitors. \"If a\r\nface or a manner did not please him,\" says his biographer, \"gold could\r\nnot bribe him into civility, much less to the favour of admission. One\r\nstranger might be modest and ingratiating; Pearson, like Thurlow,\r\nwould only give him a silent contemptuous stare; another would be\r\nrude; Pearson would laugh at his rudeness, tell him the orator of the\r\nmoment, and, perhaps, shove him in, although he had before refused\r\ndozens who were known to him.\"[417]\r\n\r\n  [417] Ibid., p. 6.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Queen Victoria's reign a suggestion was made that\r\nthe public should be admitted without orders of any kind. This idea\r\nwas successfully opposed by Lord John Russell, who expressed a fear\r\nthat in such circumstances the galleries would be filled with\r\npickpockets and other objectionable persons.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1867 strangers sometimes hired substitutes to keep places for\r\nthem in the crowd which thronged St. Stephen's Hall on the morning of\r\na big debate. These representatives would arrive as early as 2.30\r\na.m., and, like the messenger boys in the _queue_ outside a modern\r\ntheatre, wait patiently until the door was opened in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the system of balloting for seats in the Strangers' Gallery\r\nwas first instituted. Members had long been in the habit of giving\r\norders \"to bearer,\" written on the backs of envelopes or any scraps of\r\npaper, which were freely forged and transferred from one visitor to\r\nanother. Strangers who were armed with these gallery passes were now\r\ncompelled to ballot for precedence, and though on important nights the\r\nnumber of disappointed applicants was great, visitors gained the\r\nadvantage of not being kept waiting for hours on the chance of\r\nobtaining a seat.\r\n\r\nThis system continued to obtain until the time of the Fenian scares,\r\nin 1885, when, owing to the fact that two strangers admitted to the\r\nGallery on August 4th proved to be well-known dynamiters, the police\r\nbecame alarmed for the safety of the House. To prevent the recurrence\r\nof such an unwelcome visit it was ordered that all applications for\r\nadmission should be made in writing to the Speaker's secretary. The\r\nsignatures of the strangers applying for places could thus be verified\r\nby comparison with their signatures in the Gallery book.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of Parliament are supposed to be secret, and, though\r\nthe practice of avoiding publicity has long fallen into disuse, it is\r\nstill always possible for strangers to be excluded should the occasion\r\ndemand it. They were not welcomed with effusion in either House, a\r\ncentury or two ago. In 1740 Lord Chancellor Hardwicke declared to the\r\nLords that \"another thing doth diminish the dignity of the House;\r\nadmitting all kinds of auditors to your debates. This makes them be\r\nwhat they ought not to be, and gives occasion to saying things which\r\nelse would not be said.\"[418] Thirty years later, as we have already\r\nseen, during a speech of the Duke of Manchester's on the state of the\r\nnation, Lord Gower rose and desired that the House of Lords should be\r\ncleared of all who were not peers. The Duke of Richmond strongly\r\nobjected, considering this an insult to the members of Parliament and\r\nothers who were present. Chatham tried in vain to address the House,\r\nand finally, as a dignified protest, he and a score of other peers\r\nleft the Chamber.\r\n\r\n  [418] \"Life of Lord Hardwicke,\" vol. i. p. 489.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar scenes have occurred in the Lower House. On one\r\noccasion, indeed, the members of the popular assembly so far forgot\r\nthemselves as to hurl epithets of abuse at a distinguished stranger\r\nwho was in their midst. On February 22, 1837, Sheil made a violent\r\nattack in the House of Commons upon ex-Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, the\r\nIrish Municipal Bill being under discussion at the time. Lyndhurst had\r\nbeen accused of saying that three-quarters of the people of Ireland\r\nwere aliens in blood and only awaited a favourable opportunity to cast\r\noff the government of England as the yoke of a tyrannical oppressor,\r\nand this had roused the Irish to fury. The ex-Chancellor happened to\r\nstroll into the House of Commons while Sheil was speaking, and took\r\nhis seat below the bar. Immediately the Irish members turned upon him,\r\nand for about ten minutes shouted insults at the venerable statesman,\r\nwho remained apparently unmoved by the clamour.[419]\r\n\r\n  [419] Greville, \"Memoirs,\" vol. iii. p. 389.\r\n\r\nUp to within the last forty years it was quite sufficient for a member\r\nof Parliament to inform the Speaker that he \"espied strangers\" for the\r\ngalleries to be instantly cleared. On April 27, 1875, however, the\r\ncantankerous and obstructive Mr. Biggar brought this rule into\r\ndisrepute by calling the Speaker's attention to the Strangers' Gallery\r\nat a time when its occupants included the Prince of Wales and the\r\nGerman Ambassador. In accordance with the regulations of the House,\r\nthese distinguished visitors were compelled to leave forthwith. This\r\nquite gratuitous act of discourtesy on the part of an extremely\r\nunpopular member was little to the taste of the House. The sentiments\r\nof the majority were aptly voiced by Disraeli when he begged Mr.\r\nBiggar to bear in mind that the House was above all things \"an\r\nassembly of gentlemen.\" On the Prime Minister's motion, carried by a\r\nunanimous vote, the Standing Order relative to the exclusion of\r\nstrangers was temporarily suspended, and the galleries reopened. A\r\nresolution of Disraeli's was eventually adopted whereby strangers\r\ncould only be compelled to withdraw on a division in favour of their\r\nexclusion, no debate or amendment being permitted; though it was still\r\nleft to the discretion of the Speaker or Chairman to order their\r\nwithdrawal at any time and from any part of the House, if necessary.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the House of Commons enter by St Stephen's porch, where,\r\nuntil recently, they were interrogated by the police constable on\r\nduty. If their answers proved satisfactory, they were admitted to the\r\nCentral Hall, whence they dispatched printed cards inscribed with\r\ntheir names, addresses, and the object of their visit, to such members\r\nas they desired to see. The duty of ministering to the needs of\r\nfriends who were anxious to listen to the debates was one of the minor\r\ndiscomforts of membership. There is a story of a member of Parliament\r\nreceiving a letter from a constituent asking for a pass to the\r\nSpeaker's Gallery or, if that were impossible, six tickets to the\r\nZoological Gardens. The natural inference to be gathered from this\r\nrequest must be that the House of Commons, which Lord Brougham once\r\nlikened to a menagerie, is capable of affording six times as much\r\nentertainment as the monkey-house in Regent's Park.\r\n\r\nUntil the last session of 1908 members could obtain two daily orders\r\nof admission for strangers from the Speaker's secretary or the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, the Speaker's and Strangers' Galleries (which were\r\namalgamated in 1888) providing accommodation for about one hundred and\r\nsixty visitors. In the autumn of 1908, however, a man who wished to\r\nadvertise the cause of Female Suffrage--and incidentally\r\nhimself--threw a number of pamphlets down from the gallery on to the\r\nfloor of the House, and was summarily ejected. This resulted in an\r\norder issued by the Speaker that for the remainder of the session no\r\nstrangers should be admitted. The Strangers' Galleries were reopened\r\nin May of the following year, and new regulations were framed to\r\nprevent the recurrence of such a scene. Visitors are now permitted to\r\napply at a special bureau in St. Stephen's Hall, at any time after\r\n4.15 p.m. and, if there is room, are at once admitted to the gallery\r\nwithout the formality of searching for a member. Each stranger signs a\r\ndeclaration undertaking to abstain from making any interruption or\r\ndisturbance, and to obey the rules for the maintenance of order in the\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nApplause, or the expression of any feeling, is strictly prohibited in\r\nthe Strangers' Gallery, and the attendants on duty there have\r\ninstructions to expel offenders without waiting for any explanation of\r\ntheir conduct. In the commencement of the last century a stranger once\r\nshouted, \"You're a liar!\" while O'Connell was speaking, and was\r\narrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms and compelled to apologise the next\r\nday.[420] Since that time, until recently, visitors have behaved with\r\ncommendable decorum.\r\n\r\n  [420] Boyd's \"Reminiscences,\" p. 49.\r\n\r\nThe instances of strangers causing a commotion in Parliament by\r\nextraordinary or improper behaviour are few in number. The\r\nassassination of Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister, by a visitor in\r\n1812 is undoubtedly the most tragic event that has ever taken place\r\nwithin the precincts of the House of Commons, the murderer being a mad\r\nLiverpool merchant, named Bellingham, who had a grievance against the\r\nGovernment. The recollection of this outrage almost gave rise to a\r\npanic some years later when a wild-eyed, haggard man rushed into the\r\nHouse while Sir Robert Peel was speaking, and walked boldly up to the\r\nMinister. Stopping within a few feet of the speaker, this alarming\r\nstranger made a low bow. \"I beg your pardon,\" he remarked suavely,\r\n\"but I am an unfortunate man who has just been poisoned by Earl Grey!\"\r\nHe was at once removed to the nearest lunatic asylum.[421]\r\n\r\n  [421] Doyle's \"Recollections,\" p. 174.\r\n\r\nOther strangers have from time to time created a mild consternation or\r\namusement by some eccentricity of dress or deportment. In 1833 a young\r\nScotsman crossed the bar of the Commons and sat deliberately down on a\r\nbench among the members, where he remained undiscovered for some time.\r\nIn the same year a compatriot, garbed in full Highland costume,\r\nunwittingly entered the side gallery reserved for members, and\r\nprepared to listen to the debate from this comfortable quarter. On\r\nbeing informed of his mistake, this hardy Northman was so overcome\r\nwith terror at the contemplation of his crime and the consequences\r\nthat would probably ensue--nothing short of death could, he imagined,\r\nbe the punishment appropriate to such an offence--that he took to his\r\nheels and ran like a hare, never pausing for breath until he reached\r\nSomerset House, a mile and a half away.[422] Sir Wilfrid Lawson in\r\n1894 was shown a man in the Lobby who had been turned out of the\r\ngallery for being drunk. On asking what crime the stranger had\r\ncommitted, he was told that he had said \"Bosh!\" to some of the\r\nspeeches. This, as Sir Wilfrid remarked, was not conclusive evidence\r\nof drunkenness.[423]\r\n\r\n  [422] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 16.\r\n\r\n  [423] G. W. E. Russell's \"Sir Wilfrid Lawson,\" p. 227.\r\n\r\nA strange Irishman provided the peers with some amusement in 1908 by\r\nappearing in the House of Lords attired in a saffron-coloured kilt and\r\ntoga which he claimed to be his national costume, and which had\r\ndoubtless been so ever since the days of Darwin's missing link. He\r\nturned out to be harmless enough, and, though momentarily disturbing\r\nto Black Rod's peace of mind, did nothing more alarming than to\r\nprovide another example of the well-known fact that it is possible to\r\nbe a Celt and at the same time to lack a sense of humour.\r\n\r\nStrangers of the male sex who visit the Upper House may be\r\naccommodated in the large Strangers' Gallery facing the throne, or, if\r\nmembers of Parliament, in the special House of Commons' gallery, or at\r\nthe bar. Privy councillors and the eldest sons of peers are allowed to\r\nsit or stand upon the steps of the Throne, and there are special\r\ngalleries set apart for the use of the _corps diplomatique_ and the\r\nPress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN 1910]\r\n\r\nThe question of allowing women to attend the debates has long\r\npresented difficulties to the parliamentary mind, though at one time\r\nit was not unusual to see lady visitors actually sitting in the\r\nChamber itself side by side with their husbands and friends. \"Ought\r\nfemales to be admitted?\" asked Jeremy Bentham, many years ago,\r\nunhesitatingly answering his own question in the negative a moment\r\nlater. To remove them from an assembly where tranquil reason ought\r\nalone to reign was, as he explained, to avow their influence, and\r\nshould not therefore be wounding to their pride. \"The seductions of\r\neloquence and ridicule are most dangerous instruments in a political\r\nassembly,\" he says. \"Admit females--you add new force to these\r\nseductions.\" In the presence of the gentler sex, Bentham suggests,\r\neverything must necessarily take an exalted tone, brilliant and\r\ntragical--\"excitement and tropes would be scattered everywhere.\" All\r\nwould be sacrificed to vanity and the display of wit, to please the\r\nladies in the audience.[424] If the serious business of debate were to\r\nbe sacrificed to \"tropes,\" no doubt the British Constitution would be\r\nconsiderably endangered; but experience has taught us that the\r\npresence of ladies has not affected the debates detrimentally, and the\r\nexcitement caused in the breasts of our legislators by the sight of a\r\ncontingent of the fair sex is not of a kind to prove alarming.\r\n\r\n  [424] \"Works,\" vol. ii. 327.\r\n\r\nWomen have taken a strong interest in political matters in England\r\nfrom very early days.[425] We even find them giving occasional\r\nexpression to their views upon some Government measure with a violence\r\nwhich did not at all commend itself to the authorities. In the\r\nJournals of the House for March 5, 1606, is the following entry: \"A\r\nClamour of Women against Sir Robert Johnson, for speaking against a\r\nBill touching Wherry-men; upon complaint of which the Commons ordered,\r\nthat Notice should be given to the Justices of the Peace, to prevent\r\nand suppress such disorders.\"[426] What steps the Justices of the\r\nPeace took to quell this feminine clamour history does not relate. In\r\n1675 some confusion was caused by the Speaker observing ladies in the\r\ngallery, and though a member suggested that they were not ladies at\r\nall, but merely men in fine clothes, the Speaker insisted that he had\r\ncaught sight of petticoats.\r\n\r\n  [425] Ladies of rank often attended the Saxon Witenagemots, and in the\r\n  reigns of Henry III., Edward I., and Edward III. certain abbesses were\r\n  summoned to send proxies to Parliament. (See G. B. Smith's \"History,\"\r\n  vol. i p. 11.) In the sixteenth century the right to elect a member\r\n  for the rotten borough of Gatton was in the hands of a woman. See\r\n  Porritt' s \"Unreformed House of Commons,\" vol. i. p. 97.\r\n\r\n  [426] \"Observations, Rules, etc.,\" p. 162.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Queen Anne ladies were strongly infected with the\r\nspirit of party. Addison declares that even the patches they wore on\r\ntheir faces were so situated that the political views of the wearer\r\ncould be recognised at a glance. Friends might be distinguished from\r\nfoes in this delightful fashion, Tory ladies wearing their patches on\r\nthe left, Whigs on the right side of the face. An old number of the\r\n\"Spectator\"[427] contains the sad story of one Rosalinda, a famous\r\nWhig partisan who suffered much annoyance on this account. The fact\r\nthat Rosalinda had a beautiful mole on the Tory part of her forehead\r\ngave her enemies the chance of misrepresenting her face as having\r\nrevolted against the Whig interest--an accusation which naturally\r\ndepressed the poor lady considerably.\r\n\r\n  [427] No. 812, June 2, 1711.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords has always been more hospitable than the Commons in\r\nits treatment of women. The two side galleries are reserved for\r\npeeresses--though a certain portion is kept for members of the _corps\r\ndiplomatique_, and for the Commons--and there is a large box on the\r\nfloor of the House where the wives of peers' eldest sons sit, and a\r\nnumber of seats below the bar to which Black Rod may introduce ladies.\r\n\r\nThe peers have not, however, been exempt from the occasional\r\ninconveniences attaching to the presence of women. Lord Shaftesbury,\r\nduring the term of his Lord Chancellorship, complained bitterly of the\r\n\"droves of ladies that attended all causes,\" and said that things had\r\nreached such a pass that men \"borrowed or hired of their friends,\r\nhandsome sisters or daughters to deliver their petitions.\"[428] And in\r\n1739, the fair Kitty, Duchess of Queensberry, headed a storming party\r\nand successfully besieged a gallery in the House of Lords from which\r\nladies had been excluded in order to make room for members of the\r\nCommons.[429] Grenville declares that the steps of the Throne were\r\ninconveniently thronged with women in 1829. \"Every fool in London\r\nthinks it necessary to be there,\" he says. \"They fill the whole space,\r\nand put themselves in front, with their large bonnets, without either\r\nfear or shame.\"[430]\r\n\r\n  [428] Townsend's \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii. p. 461.\r\n\r\n  [429] \"Letters and Works of Lady M. W. Montagu,\" vol. ii. p. 37. (I\r\n  have described this incident at length in \"A Group of Scottish Women,\"\r\n  pp. 137-8.)\r\n\r\n[430] \"Memoirs,\" 4 April, 1829.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, women were allowed to be present in Parliament to listen to\r\nelection petitions, and continued to be admitted to the body of the\r\nHouse of Commons until 1778.[431] In this year a member named Captain\r\nJohnstone insisted that strangers should withdraw, and the female\r\nsection of the audience absolutely declined to do so. Threats,\r\nentreaties, all were useless. With the charming obstinacy of their\r\nsex, the fair visitors clung to their seats, and refused to budge an\r\ninch. Among the ladies who led this revolt was the Duchess of\r\nDevonshire, and a celebrated beauty of the name of Musters. They were\r\nassisted by a certain number of male admirers, and, so successful were\r\ntheir efforts, that two long hours elapsed before the galleries could\r\nbe cleared. This incident caused the Speaker to forbid the future\r\nadmittance of women, and until after the fire of 1834, ladies could\r\nonly listen to debates clandestinely, and in a manner which entailed\r\nthe maximum of personal discomfort. Their absence does not seem to\r\nhave had any effect upon the length of the debates. \"I was in hopes\r\nthat long speeches would have been knocked on the head when the ladies\r\nwere excluded from the galleries,\" said the doorkeeper; \"they often\r\nused to keep the members up.\"[432]\r\n\r\n  [431] See A. Young's \"Autobiography,\" p. 17. (Election Petitions were\r\n  tried before the whole House, and thus resolved themselves into mere\r\n  party struggles. In 1770, Grenville moved that they be referred to\r\n  small committees.)\r\n\r\n  [432] Pearson's \"Political Dictionary,\" p. 34.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commons sat in the old St Stephen's Chapel, that chamber was\r\ndivided into two parts by a false roof. The upper half consisted of a\r\nbig empty room like a barn, with unglazed windows. In the centre of\r\nthe floor of this apartment was the ventilating shaft of the House, a\r\nrough casement with eight small openings, situated exactly above the\r\nchandelier in the ceiling of the chamber below. To this room were\r\nconducted the lady friends of members desirous of catching a glimpse\r\nof the Commons at work. The door was locked upon them, and they were\r\npermitted to sit on a circular bench which surrounded the ventilator,\r\nand peer down through the openings, while every now and then their\r\nimprisonment would be lightened by a visit from some kindly attendant,\r\nwho would tell them the name of the member addressing the House. The\r\nonly light was provided by a farthing dip stuck in a tin candlestick,\r\nand the room was gloomy and depressing. It is an ill wind, however,\r\nthat blows nobody any good, and once when O'Connell went up there\r\nexpecting to find his wife, he kissed the Dowager Duchess of Richmond\r\nby mistake.[433]\r\n\r\n  [433] Grantley Berkeley's \"Recollections,\" vol. i. p. 369.\r\n\r\nMaria Edgeworth has left a description of a visit she paid to this\r\nmelancholy spot in 1822. \"In the middle of the garret,\" she says, \"is\r\nwhat seemed like a sentry box of deal boards, and old chairs placed\r\nround it; on these we got, and stood and peeped over the top of the\r\nboards.\"[434] From this vantage-point she could see the chandelier\r\nblazing just beneath her, and below it again the Table, with the mace\r\nresting upon it, and the Speaker's polished boots--nothing more.\r\n\r\n  [434] \"Life and Letters,\" vol. ii. p. 66.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five tickets issued nightly by the Sergeant-at-Arms for\r\nadmission to this dungeon were much sought after, a fact which\r\ntestifies eloquently to the political enthusiasm of our\r\ngreat-grandmothers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Speaker's order, ladies still continued occasionally\r\nto find their way into more comfortable parts of the House. Wraxall\r\ndeclares that he saw the famous Duchess of Gordon sitting in the\r\nStrangers' Gallery dressed as a man.[435] And in 1834, a sister of\r\nsome member entered one of the side galleries, and sat there\r\nundisturbed for a long time, the gallantry of the officials forbidding\r\nthem to turn her out.[436]\r\n\r\n  [435] \"Posthumous Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\n  [436] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 17.\r\n\r\nWhen the new Houses of Parliament were built, slightly better\r\naccommodation was provided for the fair sex. It was at first proposed\r\nthat they should be seated in the open galleries of the Commons, but\r\nthis suggestion met with little support. Miss Harriet Martineau,\r\nwriting somewhere about 1876, prophesied pessimistically that if such\r\na proposition were carried out, the galleries would be occupied by\r\ngiddy and frivolous women, lovers of sensation, with plenty of time\r\nupon their hands; \"a nuisance to the Legislature and a serious\r\ndisadvantage to the wiser of their own sex.\"[437] This idea seems to\r\nhave been the popular one, and it was resolved to keep the ladies who\r\nattended debates as much in the background as possible.\r\n\r\n  [437] \"History of the Peace,\" vol. iii. p. 375.\r\n\r\nThe present gallery has many disadvantages. Its occupants are enclosed\r\nin a cage which prevents them from obtaining a good view of the\r\nproceedings, and altogether conceals them from the gaze of the\r\nmembers. Repeated attempts have been made to secure better\r\naccommodation, notably by Mr. Grantley Berkeley, to whom a number of\r\nladies in 1841 presented a piece of plate in recognition of his\r\nservices on their behalf. The House is determined, however, that its\r\ndeliberations shall not be affected by the presence of any disturbing\r\nelement, agreeing apparently with that member who assured the Speaker\r\nthat if ladies were permitted to sit undisguised in the gallery, \"the\r\nfeelings of the gallant old soldiers and gentlemen would be so excited\r\nand turned from political affairs, that they would not be able to do\r\ntheir duty to their country.\"[438]\r\n\r\n  [438] Berkeley's \"Recollections,\" vol. i. p. 359.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion has often been made that the grille should be taken\r\naway from the front of the Ladies' Gallery, but it is doubtful whether\r\nthe removal of this screen would commend itself to the visitors. Its\r\nretention bestows one undoubted benefit upon them; it allows ladies to\r\nsteal away unnoticed during the speech of some bore, with whom they\r\nmay be personally acquainted, or whose feelings they would not like to\r\nhurt. This is an advantage which cannot be esteemed too highly.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies' Gallery, which, as has often been said, might be called,\r\nbut for its occupants, a veritable \"chamber of horrors,\" is not\r\nconsidered to be within the House. Consequently, when strangers are\r\nforced to withdraw, ladies may still remain. They are even allowed to\r\nbe present during prayers. The feminine privilege of not being\r\nexcluded with other strangers is shared by the peers, who, since 1698,\r\nhave always (with the exception of a few years) had a gallery reserved\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nUp to a short time ago members of the House of Commons were allowed to\r\nintroduce ladies to the inner lobby, whence they could obtain a\r\nfragmentary glimpse of the proceedings through a small window. This\r\nprivilege was withdrawn in 1908, when a lady who was the guest of a\r\nmember sought to make some return for his hospitality by rushing on to\r\nthe floor of the House and shouting, \"Votes for Women!\" Shortly before\r\nthis two other ladies in the gallery, also the guests of members, had\r\nattempted to prove the fitness of their sex for the franchise by\r\nchaining themselves to the grille and screaming. This was the first\r\ninstance of unruly behaviour in the Ladies' Gallery since June of the\r\nyear 1888, when some women applauded a speech, much to the indignation\r\nof Speaker Peel. It resulted in the closing of the gallery, and the\r\nexclusion of all but the Speaker's own personal guests, on whose sense\r\nof honour and decency he could rely. In 1909, however, the Ladies'\r\nGallery was once more thrown open to members of the fair sex, tickets\r\nof admission being confined to the relatives of members, who balloted\r\nfor them a week in advance. The ladies were required to sign an\r\nundertaking to behave decorously while they occupied seats in the\r\ngallery, and their exact relationship to members was not inquired into\r\ntoo closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REPORTING\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the strangers who honour the Palace of Westminster with their\r\npresence none are treated with greater consideration than the\r\nreporters. This touching regard shown for the comfort of the Press is\r\na flower of modern growth. It has blossomed forth within the last\r\nfifty years, watered by that love of publicity which is nowadays as\r\ncommon in St. Stephen's as elsewhere. Journalists are in the habit of\r\ncomplaining that the public no longer requires those full reports of\r\nparliamentary utterances which a few years ago were considered a very\r\nnecessary part of the day's news. Short political sketches have taken\r\nthe place of full verbatim reports, and very few papers give anything\r\nbut a rough outline of the daily parliamentary proceedings.\r\nPoliticians themselves, however, do not appear to share the general\r\naversion to reading their speeches in print, and it is strange to\r\ncontrast the warm welcome accorded by Parliament to modern journalism\r\nwith the cold reception met with by reporters in the days of our\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nIn the Order Book of the House of Commons there still exists a\r\nStanding Order which, though long in disuse, has never been repealed,\r\ndeclaring it a gross breach of privilege to print or publish anything\r\nrelating to the proceedings of either House. This is but a relic of\r\nthose distant days when the perpetual conflicts between the Commons\r\nand the Crown made secrecy a necessity of debate.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Parliament was anything\r\nbut anxious that the result of its deliberations should be made\r\npublic, except in such a form as it considered desirable. The Commons\r\nespecially feared that information as to their intentions should reach\r\nthe King's ears, and took every possible precaution to avert such a\r\ncalamity. In this they were not altogether successful. During the\r\ndebates on the proposed impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham, in\r\n1626, members were very busy with their pencils. The King himself had\r\nas many as four or five amateur note-takers present to supply him with\r\nreports, and among the private members were many other unofficial\r\nreporters. Of these, perhaps, the most famous was Sir Symonds D'Ewes,\r\nthe member for Sudbury, a lawyer with only one eye, devout, ambitious,\r\nconceited, and something of a snob.[439] Records were, to his way of\r\nthinking, the most ravishing and satisfying part of human knowledge.\r\nHis historical researches had given him an acquaintance with\r\nprecedents which was long the envy of his colleagues in Parliament. In\r\n1629 he transcribed the Journals of both Houses from the original\r\nJournal books, adding comments of his own, and inserting various\r\ninteresting speeches which he obtained from private manuscripts and\r\ndiaries. When objections were raised to his incorrigible _cacoethes\r\nscribendi_, \"If you will not permit us to write,\" he observed\r\npathetically, \"we must go to sleep, as some among us do, or go to\r\nplays, as others have done.\"[440] The contemplation of such tragic\r\nalternatives did not, however, shake the resolution of the Commons,\r\nand the practice of note-taking was put a stop to by a peremptory\r\norder of the House.\r\n\r\n  [439] \"Next to religion,\" he says in his \"Autobiography\" (i. 309), \"my\r\n  chief aim is to enrich my posterity with good blood, knowing it to be\r\n  the greatest honour that can betide a family, to be often linked with\r\n  the female inheritrices of ancient stock.\"\r\n\r\n  [440] Forster's \"Grand Remonstrance,\" p. 124 n.\r\n\r\nSir Symonds' peculiar knowledge of parliamentary precedents resulted\r\nin his perpetual interference with the procedure of the House. His\r\nfrequent attempts to set the Speaker right upon various points of\r\norder at length irritated the Commons to the verge of madness, and it\r\nwas with a sigh of relief that his colleagues bade him farewell when\r\nhe reluctantly retired into private life to continue uninterrupted his\r\nantiquarian pursuits.\r\n\r\nRushworth, who was Assistant Clerk of the Commons at the time of the\r\nLong Parliament, proved almost as energetic a reporter as D'Ewes, and\r\nthereby repeatedly got himself into trouble. In 1642, he was forbidden\r\nto take any notes without the sanction of the House, and a Committee\r\nwas appointed to look through his manuscripts and settle how much of\r\nthem was worthy of preservation. The result of Rushworth's passion for\r\nreporting is the \"Historical Collections,\" which Carlyle has called a\r\n\"rag-fair of a book; the mournfullest torpedo rubbish-heap of jewels\r\nburied under sordid wreck and dust and dead ashes, one jewel to the\r\nwaggon-load.\"[441] One of the undoubted gems from this dust-heap is a\r\nfull account of the proceedings in Parliament on the famous occasion\r\nof Charles I.'s violent attempt to arrest the five members. This\r\ndramatic incident does not appear to have deprived Rushworth of his\r\npresence of mind. While the Commons sat openmouthed and aghast, the\r\nAssistant Clerk calmly continued to take notes of every word that fell\r\nfrom the royal lips. For this posterity owes him a debt of the deepest\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n  [441] Cromwell's \"Letters and Speeches,\" vol. i. p. 79.\r\n\r\nThe right of Parliament to deliberate in secret was long jealously\r\nguarded, any breach of that privilege being punished with extreme\r\nseverity. In 1641, an oration delivered by Lord Digby on the Bill for\r\nStrafford's attainder, and circulated on his own initiative, was\r\nordered to be burnt by the common hangman. At the same time it was\r\nformally resolved that no member should publish any speech without the\r\nexpress permission of the House.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles II. such men as Shaftesbury, Halifax, Hampden,\r\nand Hyde were not reported, though the first would occasionally issue\r\nhis speeches in pamphlet form. Towards the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, however, the House ordered utterances of exceptional\r\nimportance to be printed. During the Long Parliament licensed reports\r\nappeared under the title of \"Diurnal Occurrences of Parliament,\" and\r\nlater on a meagre outline of the daily proceedings of Parliament began\r\nto be published. But when Locke, in 1675, printed a report of a House\r\nof Lords' debate, calling it \"A letter from a Person of Quality to His\r\nFriend,\" it was ordered by the Privy Council to be burnt.\r\n\r\nThe Licensing Act of 1662 confined printing to London, York, Oxford,\r\nand Cambridge, and did not permit the number of master printers to\r\nexceed twenty. The Commons' refusal in 1695 to renew the censorship\r\nmarks the commencement of the emancipation of the Press.\r\n\r\nA system of newsletters had been started with the Restoration, whereby\r\nthe outside world could learn something of the doings of Parliament.\r\nThis no doubt whetted the public appetite, and increased the popular\r\ninterest in political affairs. In 1694, however, it was resolved in\r\nParliament that \"no newsletter writers do in their letters or other\r\npapers that they disperse presume to intermeddle with the debates or\r\nany other proceedings of the House.\"\r\n\r\nNewsletters were rapidly followed by regular newspapers, which\r\nsupplied their readers with somewhat imaginative accounts of the\r\ndebates. The periodicals of William III.'s day sometimes reported the\r\nspeeches of particular speakers, who contributed their manuscripts to\r\nthe papers. During the factious years that followed, the debates were\r\nofficially distributed in monthly parts, but at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century the publication of newspaper reports was again\r\ndeclared a breach of parliamentary privilege, and a stamp duty was\r\nimposed with a view to arresting the circulation of the Opposition\r\nPress.\r\n\r\nA regular party organ first appeared in Queen Anne's reign. This was\r\n\"The Examiner,\" subsidised by Harley's Ministry, and conducted by\r\nSwift. It was answered by \"The Whig Examiner,\" edited by Addison,\r\nwhich was followed by \"Manwaring's Medley,\" a paper which soon became\r\nthe recognised journal of the Opposition.[442] Towards the close of\r\nAnne's reign Boyer began to publish \"The Political State of Great\r\nBritain\" in which he included accounts of all the important\r\nparliamentary debates.[443] This was succeeded in 1716 by \"The\r\nHistorical Register,\" which purported to describe the proceedings in\r\nboth Houses. In the reports of the Commons' debates the names of the\r\nspeakers were published without concealment, but the Lords were\r\ntreated more cautiously. Thus, in an account of the Septennial Bill,\r\nwe find such sentences as, \"a noble Duke stood up and said,\" or \"this\r\nwas answered by a northern peer,\" no further clue being given as to\r\nthe identity of the several speakers.[444]\r\n\r\n  [442] Cook's \"History of Party,\" vol. i. pp. 357, 582.\r\n\r\n  [443] May's \"Constitutional History,\" vol. i. p. 422.\r\n\r\n  [444] Hawkins' \"Life of Johnson,\" vol. xii.\r\n\r\n\"The Historical Register\" was superseded twenty years later by the\r\n\"Gentleman's Magazine,\" a monthly periodical founded by the bookseller\r\nCave and edited by Guthrie. Cave used to obtain admission to the House\r\nof Commons for himself and a few friends, and would there take\r\nsurreptitious notes of the proceedings. These he subsequently\r\nelaborated in some adjoining coffee-house, evolving lengthy and vivid\r\ndescriptions of the debates from his inner consciousness. His editor\r\nwas the first journalist to obtain access to the official\r\nparliamentary Journals. The Government had apparently by this time\r\nbegun to regard the Press as a more or less necessary evil, and\r\nthought it worth while to pay Guthrie a small sum for his services,\r\neven providing him with a pension when he retired.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary articles in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" were\r\npublished under the title of the \"Senate of Lilliput,\" the real names\r\nof the various debaters being replaced by pseudonyms which deceived\r\nnobody.[445] This periodical is famous as being the medium through\r\nwhich Dr. Johnson originally published his political views. When he\r\nwas first employed by Cave upon the staff of his paper Johnson was\r\nstill struggling, not for fame, but for existence, and had no\r\nobjection to any form of literary labour so long as it provided him\r\nwith a means of livelihood. His original duties consisted in revising\r\nthe rough notes made by Guthrie, but by 1740 he had become entirely\r\nresponsible for the parliamentary articles, and five years later\r\nsucceeded Guthrie in the editorial chair.\r\n\r\n  [445] For example: Sholming for Cholmondeley, Ptit for Pitt, and\r\n  Gumdahm for Wyndham.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the proceedings were often written under great\r\ndifficulties. Dr. Johnson would at times be compelled to invent the\r\nwhole debate, depending solely upon his imagination, and being\r\nprovided with nothing more inspiring than a list of the speakers and\r\nof the subjects under discussion. \"I wrote that in a garret!\" he is\r\nalways supposed to have said of a much admired speech of Pitt's, and\r\nperhaps the oratorical fame of many a statesman of that day is due to\r\nDr. Johnson's literary skill. His style was as a rule far too perfect\r\nto pass for that of an ordinary member of Parliament, and in his\r\nreports he is often accused of giving not so much what the speakers\r\nsaid as what they ought to have said. Nor was his pen an entirely\r\nimpartial one, for he always took care, as he explained to Boswell,\r\nthat the \"Whig dogs\" should not have the best of it in debate. Writing\r\nas he did, very hurriedly and from scanty materials, the compilation\r\nof parliamentary reports gave him little satisfaction. As soon as he\r\nfound that his debates were thought to be genuine, he determined to\r\ncease their composition, and in the later years of his life often\r\nexpressed regret at having been engaged in work of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe \"London Magazine\" was the next journal to publish debates,\r\nimitating the methods of the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" by pretending to\r\nreport the proceedings of an imaginary Roman Senate, and alluding to\r\nthe speakers by more or less appropriate Latin names.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these various efforts to establish the liberty of the\r\nPress, the attitude of Parliament long remained antagonistic. In 1728\r\na fresh resolution was passed in the House declaring it to be a\r\nbreach of privilege for any one to print any account of the debates,\r\nand in the following year a printer of Gloucester was summoned to the\r\nbar of the Lords and severely reprimanded for publishing a report of\r\ntheir proceedings.[446] In 1738 Speaker Onslow brought up the subject\r\nof parliamentary reporting in the Commons, and a debate ensued. \"If we\r\ndo not put a speedy stop to this practice,\" said Winnington, \"you will\r\nhave the speeches of this House every day printed, even during your\r\nsession, and we shall be looked upon as the most contemptible assembly\r\non the face of the earth.\" Pelham, however, was inclined to deal\r\nlightly with the Press. \"Let them alone,\" he said once, \"they make\r\nbetter speeches for us than we can make for ourselves.\"[447] But it\r\nwas a long time before this sensible view became general.\r\n\r\n  [446] Raikes's \"Journal,\" vol. ii. p. 321.\r\n\r\n  [447] Coxe's Pelham Administration, vol. I. p. 355.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Press and Parliament reached a climax in 1771,\r\nwhen Wilkes's paper, the \"North Briton,\" was publishing the much\r\ndiscussed \"Junius letters.\" Public opinion was by this time becoming\r\ngradually alive to the necessity for granting freedom to the Press,\r\nand needed but the opportunity to express itself openly upon the\r\nsubject. The occasion had at length arrived. The Commons in this year\r\nwere much incensed at the behaviour of some wretched City printers who\r\nhad offended against the privileges of the House, and despatched the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms to arrest them. After much difficulty two of the\r\nculprits were apprehended, but on being taken before the City Aldermen\r\nthe latter at once ordered their release. When a messenger from the\r\nHouse of Commons attempted to arrest another printer, he was himself\r\nseized and carried before the civic authorities, charged with assault.\r\nThe House was furious at this treatment of their officer, and\r\ncommitted the Lord Mayor and one of the offending aldermen--both\r\nmembers of Parliament--to the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe Press on this occasion found a worthy champion in Edmund Burke.\r\nOn the 2nd of March, in a debate which lasted twenty-two hours, Burke\r\neffectually held his own, and so bullied and ridiculed the House that\r\nhe brought the whole business to a standstill. By continually forcing\r\ndivisions and making use of other obstructive tactics, he managed to\r\ndelay the parliamentary attempt to muzzle the Press, and gained a\r\ngreat victory for the cause of freedom.\r\n\r\nFrom being actively disliked the Reporters gradually grew to be\r\ntolerated, and finally courted and cultivated. Members who had\r\nformerly objected to the publication of their speeches soon began to\r\ncomplain with equal bitterness that they were not reported at all.\r\nOthers, again, grumbled at being misreported, words being attributed\r\nto them for which they altogether declined to be responsible.\r\nWedderburn, afterwards Lord Loughborough, complained, in 1771, that\r\nthe reporting in the Commons was shocking. Of the report of one speech\r\nwhich he was supposed to have delivered he said that \"to be sure,\r\nthere are in that report a few things which I did say, but many things\r\nwhich I am glad I did not say, and some things which I wish I could\r\nhave said.\"[448] Burke's famous sentiment that \"Virtue does not depend\r\non climates or degrees\" was first printed as \"on _climaxes_ and\r\n_trees_.\" When Sheridan made his great speech at the trial of Warren\r\nHastings, the \"Morning Chronicle\" reported him as having said that\r\n\"nothing equal in criminality was to be traced either in ancient or\r\nmodern history, in the correct periods of Tacitus, or the luminous\r\npage of Gibbon.\"[449] The historian was delighted at being mentioned\r\nin so flattering a fashion; \"I could not hear without emotion the\r\npersonal compliment,\" he says in his autobiography. But when Sheridan\r\nwas asked how he came to apply the epithet \"luminous\" to Gibbon, \"I\r\nsaid Vo-luminous!\" he replied shortly.[450]\r\n\r\n  [448] Campbell's \"Lives of the Chancellors,\" vol. vi. p. 93.\r\n\r\n  [449] \"Morning Chronicle,\" June 14, 1788.\r\n\r\n  [450] Samuel Rogers' \"Recollections,\" p. 67.\r\n\r\nCobbett, too, suffered much from bad reporting, and when he ventured\r\nto find fault, the Press retaliated by ceasing to report him at all.\r\nSpring-Rice (afterwards Lord Monteagle) was punished in a similar\r\nfashion for two years, because he had said something deprecatory of\r\njournalism. Another member complained that his speeches had been\r\npublished in the papers with certain of the sentences printed in\r\nitalics. \"I never spoke in italics in my life!\" he exclaimed\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nO'Connell in 1833 accused a reporter of wilfully perverting one of his\r\nspeeches. By way of excuse the Pressman stated that on his way home\r\nfrom the House he had been caught in a shower of rain, which had\r\nwashed out many of his notes. This explanation did not satisfy the\r\nLiberator, who justly remarked that it must surely have been an\r\nextraordinary shower which could not only wash out one speech, but\r\nactually wash in another![451] He was never a favourite of the Press,\r\nand they finally decided to discontinue the report of his speeches. As\r\na means of revenge, he determined to prevent all newspaper reporting,\r\nand for some time succeeded in doing so. With this end in view, he\r\nmade a practice of \"espying strangers\" on every opportunity, and each\r\ntime he did so the galleries had to be cleared. The withdrawal of the\r\nreporters had a natural but most depressing effect upon the oratory of\r\nParliament. \"For the first time within my recollection,\" says Grant,\r\n\"members kept their word when, on commencing their orations, they\r\npromised not to trespass at any length on the patience of the\r\nHouse.\"[452]\r\n\r\n  [451] O'Connell's \"Recollections and Experiences,\" vol. i. p. 220.\r\n\r\n  [452] Grant's \"Recollections,\" p. 48.\r\n\r\nThe \"Diary,\" published in 1769, and edited by William Woodfall, was\r\nthe first paper to give accounts of the parliamentary debates on the\r\nday after they had taken place. Woodfall had a marvellous memory, and\r\nwould sit in the gallery or stand at the bar of either House for\r\nhours, without taking a note of any kind, and afterwards reproduce the\r\nspeeches verbatim. He seemed not to require rest or refreshment, but\r\noccasionally fortified himself with a hard-boiled egg. His efforts\r\nwere, however, spasmodic and irregular, and it was not until 1802,\r\nwhen William Cobbett started the \"Weekly Political Register,\" which\r\nafterwards published the debates as supplements under the title of\r\n\"Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates,\" that the system of providing\r\nregular reports of the proceedings was inaugurated. In 1809 the\r\npublication of the \"Weekly Political Register\" was transferred to T.\r\nC. Hansard, whose name has been so long and honourably connected with\r\nparliamentary reporting that it is still used colloquially to describe\r\nthe official volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WOODFALL\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAINTING BY THOMAS BEACH IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY]\r\n\r\nFor over fifty years Hansard carried on the publication of debates as\r\na private speculation, by which time the Government had realised the\r\nuseful nature of his labours, and assisted him by subscribing for a\r\ncertain number of sets of the reports for public distribution. In 1877\r\na Treasury grant was made to enable him to continue the good work with\r\ngreater fullness and facility, and twelve years later he sold his\r\nrights to a syndicate. This new venture proved anything but a\r\nfinancial success, and the publication of the \"Parliamentary Debates,\"\r\nas they are now called, was then undertaken by the official Government\r\nprinters, the reports being composed from notes furnished by the staff\r\nof the \"Times.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1909 that the present system was instituted, and both\r\nHouses, while leaving the printing of debates in the hands of the\r\nKing's Printer, provided themselves with a regular staff of reporters,\r\nwho were their own officials and unconnected with any company or\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Fire, reporters in the Commons always sat in the\r\nback row of the Strangers' Gallery, to which they obtained admission\r\nby a sessional payment of three guineas. In 1831, the House of Lords\r\nprovided separate accommodation for the Press, and in the temporary\r\nHouse which was constructed in 1834 a special gallery was reserved for\r\ntheir use.\r\n\r\nThe Press Gallery in the present House of Commons holds about sixty\r\npersons, and is situated exactly behind and above the Speaker's chair.\r\nReporters of the newspapers in the Lords occupy a similar position,\r\nbut as the acoustic properties of the Upper Chamber are notoriously\r\nbad, a special arrangement has existed for some years, whereby the\r\nofficial reporter of the \"Parliamentary Debates\" is given a seat on\r\nthe floor of the House immediately behind the Clerks at the Table.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago the path of the Pressman was not so smooth as it\r\nis to-day. Up to 1840 the publication of debates was undertaken at the\r\nrisk of the printer. In that year Hansard published the report of a\r\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons, in which a certain book was\r\nreferred to as \"disgusting and obscene.\" Stockdale, the publisher of\r\nthe book in question, took the matter into Court and obtained £600\r\ndamages for libel. The House retorted by summoning to the bar the\r\nSheriffs of Middlesex who had tried the case, and reprimanded them for\r\ntheir contempt of its privileges. After this Lord John Russell took\r\nthe first opportunity of introducing a Bill rendering all publication\r\nof speeches and documents, if by the authority of Parliament, matters\r\nof privilege not amenable to ordinary law. A member of Parliament\r\ncannot, however, claim privilege for publishing or circulating the\r\nreport of any libellous speech made in the House, though he is, of\r\ncourse, protected there for anything he may say. The suggestion that\r\nprivilege of Parliament should protect members from being proceeded\r\nagainst for writing and publishing libellous articles was discussed in\r\nNovember, 1763, and finally relinquished by a large majority.[453]\r\n\r\n  [453] Walpole's \"Memoirs of the Reign of George III.,\" vol. i. p. 261.\r\n\r\nThe subject of reporting cannot be left without some mention of that\r\nofficial amateur reporter who sits upon the Treasury bench and\r\nprepares his nightly précis of the day's parliamentary proceedings.\r\nAmateur reporters there have always been in the Commons from the days\r\nof Sir Symonds D'Ewes and Sir Henry Cavendish[454] to the present\r\ntime; but there is only one upon the floor of the House whose duties\r\nhave ever been officially recognised.\r\n\r\n  [454] In the heyday of parliamentary corruption, when a critical\r\n  division was impending, Sir Hercules Langrishe was asked whether Sir\r\n  Henry Cavendish had as usual been taking notes. \"He has been taking\r\n  either notes or money,\" he replied, \"I don't know which.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a custom of many years standing the Leader of the\r\nHouse of Commons writes a nightly letter to the sovereign, whenever\r\nthe House is sitting, giving a brief _résumé_ of the debates. This\r\nletter, often composed somewhat hastily during the course of an\r\nexciting debate, is at once sent off in an official dispatch box to\r\nHis Majesty, and is subsequently filed in the library at Buckingham\r\nPalace.[455] The practice dates from the reign of George III., who\r\nrequired George Grenville, then Leader of the House of Commons, to\r\nprovide him with daily reports of the debates relating to the contest\r\nbetween Parliament and John Wilkes.\r\n\r\n  [455] On one occasion, in the hurry of dispatching his nightly\r\n  missive, Lord Randolph Churchill accidentally enclosed a quantity of\r\n  tobacco in the box which he forwarded to Queen Victoria, much to Her\r\n  Majesty's amusement.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign is not supposed to enter the Lower House--Charles I. was\r\nthe only monarch who broke this rule--and thus, in days before debates\r\nwere published at length in the papers, the Crown had no means of\r\nascertaining the doings of the Commons save through the medium of this\r\nletter. The need for this one-sided nightly correspondence no longer\r\nexists, but the custom still prevails, and adds one more to the\r\nalready multifarious duties of the Leader of the House, though\r\nnowadays it is occasionally delegated to some other Minister, or to\r\none of the Whips.\r\n\r\nTo-day Press and Parliament are mutually dependent. A great newspaper\r\nproprietor who was recently asked which of the two he considered to be\r\nthe most powerful, found some difficulty in replying. \"The Press is\r\nthe voice without which Parliament could not speak,\" he said. \"On the\r\nother hand, Parliament is the law-making machine without which the\r\nPress could not act.\" The question of their relative power and\r\nimportance must be left to the decision of individual judgment and\r\ntaste. \"Give me but the liberty of the Press,\" said Sheridan in 1810,\r\nin answer to the Premier, Spencer Perceval, \"and I will give the\r\nMinister a venal House of Peers, I will give him a corrupt and servile\r\nHouse of Commons, I will give him the full swing of the patronage of\r\noffice, I will give him the whole host of ministerial influences, I\r\nwill give him all the power that place can confer upon him to purchase\r\nsubmission and overawe resistance; and yet, armed with the liberty of\r\nthe Press, I will go forth to meet him undismayed; I will attack the\r\nmighty fabric he has reared with that mightier engine; I will shake\r\ndown from its height corruption, and lay it beneath the ruins of the\r\nabuses it was meant to shelter!\"[456]\r\n\r\n  [456] Hansard's \"Debates,\" 1st series, vol. xv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES AND REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adams, W.
