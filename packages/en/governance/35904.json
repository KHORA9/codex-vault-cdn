A moment passed before the\r\nGovernor's guests on the terrace of La Fortaleza could hear the muffled\r\nthud-thud of the distant ground batteries. Someone, the wife of a\r\nvisiting government official, exclaimed, \"My goodness, I've only seen\r\nthis in the newsreels before!\"\r\n\r\nNow the plane veered, slowly, and the lights from the San Juan side\r\njoined the Catanzas batteries in pinning the plane to the dark clouds.\r\nThe sleeve target fastened to the tail of the plane could now be seen\r\nfrom the terrace. Most of the Governor's guests gasped as the first\r\nbright jets of tracers missed the silver sleeve and sailed into the\r\nblack void above it. The ack-ack batteries were speaking with more\r\nharshness now; one of them, planted between two brick buildings, added\r\ncrashing echoes to their own reports as the guns went off.\r\n\r\nThe bombing of Pearl Harbor was still very much a topic of conversation\r\non the island; the submarine nets in the bay were joked about at the\r\ndinner table, but the jokes arose from a profound sense of gratitude for\r\nthe nets, the planes, the ships which were the island's defenses against\r\nthe undersea raiders that stalked the sea lanes between the ports of the\r\nmainland and San Juan.\r\n\r\nThe plane shifted course again, now headed directly toward La Fortaleza.\r\nThrough the increasing din of the ground guns, the Governor's young\r\nmilitary aide, Lieutenant Braga, could barely hear the ring of the\r\ntelephone nearest the terrace. He took the call, then returned to the\r\nterrace and tapped one of the guests on the shoulder. \"It's for you, Mr.\r\nHall,\" he said. \"It's Tom Harris at Panair.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Hall stood up quietly and walked into the cavernous reception\r\nroom. He walked carefully, with the steel-spring tread of a man who\r\nseems to expect the floor to blow up under him at any moment. For\r\nthirty-three years Matthew Hall had walked as other men. Since he was\r\nnot conscious of his new walk, he could not say when it had become part\r\nof him. His friends had first noticed it in Paris, in '39, but had\r\nexpected it to wear off as soon as the prison pallor disappeared. The\r\npallor had gone; the walk remained.\r\n\r\nHall's head and shoulders and hands were part of this walk. He moved\r\nwith his head forward and his shoulders hunched, with his hands slightly\r\ncocked, almost like a fighter slowly advancing to mid-ring. The\r\nshoulders were broad and thick, so broad that although Hall was of more\r\nthan average height they made him appear shorter and chunky.\r\n\r\nThe face of Matthew Hall had changed, too, with his walk. There were the\r\nobvious changes: the deep channel of a scar on his broad forehead, the\r\nsmaller one on his right jaw. The nose had changed twice, the first time\r\nin 1938 when it was broken in San Sebastian. It had swelled enormously\r\nand then knit badly and nearly two years later a New York surgeon had\r\ndone an expensive job of rebreaking and resetting the nose. Some bones\r\nhad been taken out and the once classic lines were now slightly\r\nflattened. The scars and the dented nose blended strangely well with the\r\njaws that had always been a bit too long and the soft brown poet's eyes\r\nwhich had so often betrayed Hall. With his eyes, Hall spoke his\r\ncontempt, his anger, his amusement, his joy. The eyes unerringly spoke\r\nhis inner feelings; they were always beyond his control.\r\n\r\nChanges more subtle than the scars and the flattened nose had come over\r\nHall's face within the past few years. It now had a queer, angry cast.\r\nHis lips seemed to be set in a new and almost permanent grimace of\r\nbitterness. Also the right side of his face, the cheek and the mouth,\r\nhad a way of twitching painfully when Hall was bothered and upset. And\r\nyet, as Governor Dickenson had already noted, Hall was not a completely\r\nembittered man. More often than not, his eyes would light up with a look\r\nof amused irony, the look of a man much moved by an immense private joke\r\nhe would be glad to share with his friends if he but knew how to tell it\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nWhen Hall had risen to leave the terrace, the Governor noticed that his\r\ncheek was twitching, but once he was alone in the reception room, away\r\nfrom the sight of the tracers and the target plane, Hall's face grew\r\ncalm again. He sat down in the green armchair near the phone, picked up\r\nthe receiver. \"Yes, Tom,\" he said, \"any luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. I busted open a seat for you on the San Hermano plane for\r\ntomorrow at six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it much trouble, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much.\" Tom Harris laughed. \"We had to throw Giselle Prescott off to\r\nmake room for you. Know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"God, no! But thanks a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick you up in the morning then. Good night, Matt.\"\r\n\r\nHall put the receiver back on the cradle. He sat back in the soft chair,\r\noblivious of the crashing guns, the hum of the plane's engines, the\r\nothers on the terrace. Only one thing was in his mind now--San Hermano.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the young Puerto Rican lieutenant slipped\r\ngingerly into the room. \"Mr. Hall,\" he said, softly, \"everything O.K.?\"\r\n\r\nHall smiled warmly. \"My God,\" he asked, \"you don't think the guns drove\r\nme in here?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer blushed. \"Fix you a drink?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHall shook his head, drew two Havanas from his jacket. \"No, thanks.\r\nCigar? It's from the one box I remembered to buy in Havana.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was a non-smoker. He lit a match for Hall, waited until the\r\nolder man relaxed with the burning cigar. Politely, he said, \"I know\r\nyou've been through plenty, Mr. Hall. I'm a soldier, but if ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty? Me?\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant nodded. \"_The Revenger_,\" he said, hesitantly. \"I--I read\r\nyour book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that,\" Hall said. \"_The Revenger_.\" So _The Revenger_ was plenty!\r\n\r\n\"If there's anything I can get you ...\"\r\n\r\nThe boy's voice seemed to come from far away and Hall realized that he\r\nhimself was staring into space and that the lieutenant must have sat\r\nthere for a full minute waiting for an answer. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.\r\n\"I'm really sorry. I guess I just get this way once in a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my fault,\" Braga protested. \"I should have known how hard it must\r\nbe for you to talk about--it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_De nada_,\" Hall laughed. \"I made a lecture tour last year and spent\r\nfive nights a week talking about it for months. It's just that\r\nI'm--well, that I just catch myself staring at nothing at the craziest\r\ntimes. Maybe I do need that drink. What's in the shaker there--Daiquiri?\r\nGood.\" He poured two Daiquiris from the jar on the sideboard, handed one\r\nto the lieutenant. \"I know you don't drink, either,\" he said. \"But I'm\r\nhaving this drink to toast victory--and you're a soldier.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they touched glasses, the boy saw that amused look in Hall's eyes,\r\nthe look he had seen earlier at the dinner table when one of the\r\nvisiting officials had expressed such innocent amazement at the enormity\r\nof his first taxi bill in San Juan. \"I'd better go back out there when I\r\nfinish this drink,\" he said. \"I'm glad nothing's wrong with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a right guy, Lieutenant. Thanks for looking in.\" Hall returned\r\nto his chair as the boy walked out to the terrace. So _The Revenger_ was\r\nplenty! And the kid, how old was he? Twenty? Not a day more. Which made\r\nhim eighteen when the Nazi torpedo planes peeled off over the African\r\nskies and then roared in to send their tin fish into the guts of His\r\nMajesty's own _Revenger_. Which made him fourteen when the fighting\r\nbegan, fourteen when the German pilot officers clicked their heels and\r\nmouthed the new phrase \"_Arriba Espana_\" and flew the Moors from Spanish\r\nMorocco to the mainland and touched off the shooting stages of World War\r\nII. \"_Ay, Teniente_,\" he muttered, \"you've made me feel old as hell.\r\nOlder.\"\r\n\r\nHall leaned back in his chair, tried to blow a series of smoke rings. He\r\nthought: But I'm not old. I've just seen things and done things and had\r\nthings done to me. I'm not old at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter years of anonymity in various city rooms in the States, a brief\r\nturn as a byline correspondent in Washington, a still briefer career as\r\na Broadway playwright, Matthew Hall had drawn an assignment as\r\nthird-string man for the World Press in Paris. That was in 1935, when he\r\nwas crowding thirty. The job had introduced him to Europe, and carried\r\nhim to Geneva, to Belgrade, to Bucharest, to Stockholm. Paris was the\r\njournalistic capital of the Continent; when things happened outside of\r\nParis, it was a Paris man who was sent to the scene to cover. There he\r\nwould find that the office had adequate coverage in the permanent man,\r\nand if he had any curiosity or craftsman's pride he would try to get the\r\nstory behind the story. Hall had both. They led him to the strange\r\nhalf-world of tipsters, hounded opposition leaders, minor officials of\r\nministries who would talk and produce documents for a fee, candid and\r\ncynical free-lance agents, wise old frightened politicians who sensed\r\nthe coming catastrophe in their bones, correct and stiff Nazi advance\r\nagents and politely lavish native fascists who mixed queer brews for\r\nforeign correspondents. They were the _sources close to a key ministry,\r\nthe influential elder statesmen, the prominent industrialists whose\r\nnames cannot be used_ who figured so prominently in the inside-Europe\r\ndispatches of the era.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1936, had found Hall in Nice spending a long week-end as the guest\r\nof a prominent refugee banker from Germany. The banker was the \"inside\"\r\nprophet of the month in Parisian newspaper circles. His gospel was the\r\nslightly shopworn one about German industry being fed up with Hitler and\r\nwilling to settle on Goering, Danzig and a few worthless colonies in\r\nAfrica as the price for eliminating the \"extreme Nazis\" and returning to\r\nthe family of Europe. \"He's a damned Nazi himself,\" Hall had declared\r\nwhen the invitation reached his office, but the bureau manager was\r\nmissing no bets. \"I don't care what he is, Matt. He's a story. He's\r\nnews. He's what they want to read about in Washington and in London and\r\nin Paris.\"\r\n\r\nHall never wrote his story on the refugee banker (who later turned up as\r\na Nazi economist overlord in Denmark). On a blistering Sunday Paris had\r\ncalled him by phone. Hell was popping in Madrid. The regular Madrid man\r\nwas vacationing in the States. \"Get to Madrid, Matt. Looks like you'll\r\nbe busy there for a couple of weeks until it blows over.\"\r\n\r\nLike many of his American colleagues, Hall traveled to Madrid during\r\nthat first week of the war with the idea that in less than a month one\r\nside or another would have been installed in power and he himself would\r\nbe back in Paris listening to the latest faker peddling the newest line\r\nof disguised Nazism from Berlin. But Hall was an honest man. What he saw\r\ninterested and then intrigued and then enraged him. \"This is no Spanish\r\nCivil War,\" he wrote to the Paris office in a confidential memo sent by\r\ncourier. \"This is the start of the second World War. It's the Germans\r\nand the Italians against the Spaniards. Maybe I'm crazy, but it looks to\r\nme like the British and the French are backing the fascists, while the\r\nRussians are trying to help the Republicans. How about sending someone\r\nin to cover the shooting for a week while I write a big story along\r\nthese lines?\"\r\n\r\nHe was answered in due time. \"Stick to the military conflict between the\r\nNationalists and the Loyalists. And don't send us any Red propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nThat was in October, when Caballero was preparing to quit Madrid in\r\npanic, and the Fifth Army was calmly preparing to hold the city,\r\nCaballero or no Caballero. Hall had long since lost his magnificent WP\r\nobjectivity. Through the open mails he sent a letter of resignation to\r\nParis. Antin in the Censura held the letter up, sent for Hall. The\r\nSpaniard hemmed and hawed and cleared his throat a dozen times and then\r\nhe got up from his desk and embraced Hall and told him to sit down.\r\nHall's Spanish was pretty good by then, good enough for Antin to speak\r\nto him in fluent Spanish rather than halting English. \"The English I can\r\nread with my eyes. The Spanish I speak with my heart.\"\r\n\r\nWas it that Hall was resigning because he loved the Republic? Yes, I\r\nguess you could call it that. (You could also call it a good craftsman's\r\nstubborn ideas about how to cover a war, but you didn't.) Did Hall\r\nrealize that, if he quit, an enemy of the Republic might be sent to take\r\nhis place? No, Hall didn't think. Come to think of it, though, the\r\noffice had Cavanaugh and Raney available and those two Jew-haters and\r\nMussolini-lovers would be no friends of the Republic. You are a friend,\r\na _companero_, it is right that you know. We have so many problems with\r\nthe foreign press. McBain from New York, we know he is a spy, he has\r\nlinks with the Falange. If we arrest him, the world hollers Red Terror.\r\nSo we watch him, keep all his letters, hold up his cables. Thank God he\r\nis a drunkard; two SIM men keep him drunk most of the time. Maybe his\r\noffice will fire him. You are a friend. You write the truth. Even a\r\nlittle truth by a friend whose editor chops up his cables helps the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nHall tore up his letter of resignation. When the Republic captured\r\nthousands of Italians after Guadalajara and Bruejega, Hall filed long\r\nstories based on interviews with the Blackshirts. When the Republic\r\ncaptured Nazi Condor officers and men at Belchite, Hall sent photographs\r\nof their documents to Paris with his stories.\r\n\r\nNew York kicked, and Paris warned Hall repeatedly. Finally Paris\r\ntransferred him to the Franco side. That was at the end of '38, when the\r\nRepublicans had seen their hopes dashed at Munich and the only thing\r\nthat kept them going was the feeling that they could hold out until the\r\nNazi Frankenstein finally turned on London and Paris. \"Then France will\r\nhave to rush arms and maybe a few divisions to us and the British fleet\r\nwill have to patrol the Mediterranean and the Russian planes, unable to\r\nget through now, will be able to come in through France and through the\r\nMediterranean.\" Antin figured it out that way, told it to Hall the week\r\nbefore some nice clean crusaders for Christianity let him have it with a\r\ntommy gun in the back in a Barcelona cafe.\r\n\r\nThe Falangistas were very glad to have Hall behind their lines. Their\r\nfriends pulled some wires in New York and Washington and, after two\r\nmonths, Hall was fired, but by then his notebook was growing thicker and\r\nhe elected to stay as a free lance. He was seeing the face of fascism\r\nfor the first time, he wrote, and seeing it at close range. He would\r\nstay, job or no job. He stayed, and the Gestapo in San Sebastian wrote\r\nout an order and a rat-faced little aristocrat with an embroidered gold\r\nyoke and arrows on his cape was studying Hall's notes and smirking like\r\na villain in a bad movie.\r\n\r\nThere were no charges and no explanations. They just slapped Hall into a\r\ncell in solitary, and once a day they handed him a bucket for slops and\r\nonce a day he got a chunk of bread or a thin chick-pea stew. In the\r\nbeginning he had hollered for the American consul, but the German guard\r\nwould grin and say, \"_No entiendo Espanol, Ich sprech kein Englisch_,\"\r\nand finally Hall just settled down to waiting for the end of the war.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then a smooth German major would have him brought out for\r\nquestioning; that scar on his head and the scar on his chin were grim\r\nmementos of those sessions. The Spaniards were bad but the Germans were\r\nworse. The Italians were just hysterical. There was the day the Italian\r\nofficer made the mistake of getting too close and Hall clipped him with\r\na weak right hook. The Blackshirt screamed like a woman and clung to his\r\neye; that was when they tied him to the wall and let him have it with\r\nthe steel rods on his back.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in April, the Republic keeled over in its own blood and the\r\nfascists decided to be generous to celebrate their victory. The Axis was\r\nnow openly boasting that it had run the Spanish show; the worst that\r\nHall could do would be to play into their hands by writing about how\r\ntough fascism was on any man fool enough to oppose the New Order. They\r\nwere generous, they were fair. They gave him a practically new suit of\r\nclothes, they returned his three hundred odd dollars, they even returned\r\nhis notebook with nearly all of its original notes.\r\n\r\nHall went to Paris. He spent a week soaking in warm baths and eating and\r\navoiding the WP crowd. During the week he cabled a New York book\r\npublisher he had met in Madrid in '36, when he had joined a group of\r\nAmerican intellectuals attending an anti-fascist congress. He offered to\r\nturn out a book on his experiences as a correspondent and a prisoner in\r\nFranco Spain. It was a week before he got an answer, but the answer came\r\nwith a draft of five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe swelling had gone down in his nose by then, but he still had to\r\nbreathe through his mouth. A doctor who'd looked at it wanted a hundred\r\nbucks for operating, but it meant two weeks of doing nothing but getting\r\nfixed up, and Hall hated to wait. \"Later,\" he said, \"later, when I\r\nfinish my book.\"\r\n\r\nHe poured his notes and his guts into the book, and finished it in a\r\nmonth. When he was done he borrowed some money from a friend in the\r\nParamount office and got a Clipper seat to New York.\r\n\r\nHis publisher, Bird, liked the book and rushed it to press. He also gave\r\nHall another five hundred and sent him to his own doctor to have his\r\nnose fixed up.\r\n\r\nIt was a good book, perhaps good enough to justify Bird's gamble, only\r\nit reached the critics three weeks after the Nazi panzer divisions were\r\nravaging Poland and the smart boys in Paris were wearing smarter\r\ncorrespondents' uniforms and filing fulsome stories on the genius of\r\nGamelin and Weygand. \"We'll have to face it, Matt,\" Bird said, \"no one\r\nbut you and I give a damn about Spain right now. I'm taking back copies\r\nleft and right from the booksellers. No, the hell with the advances. The\r\nwar's far from over. You'll do another book for me, and we'll make it\r\nall up.\"\r\n\r\nThrough Bird, Hall got a job as a war correspondent for a Chicago paper.\r\nThey shipped him to London, where he stewed in his own juices for\r\nmonths, and then to Cairo to join the fleet. Hall was assigned to the\r\n_Revenger_ and, when the Nazis sank her, he spent some three days on a\r\nraft with a handful of survivors. One of them died of his wounds on the\r\nraft, and another went raving mad and slit his own throat with the top\r\nof a ration tin.\r\n\r\nHall filed a story on the experience when he was brought back to Cairo,\r\nand Bird cabled \"That's your new book.\" It was an easy book to write. He\r\ntook a room at Shepheard's and pounded it out in three weeks. The\r\nBritish censors liked it as \"a tribute to British grit\" and arranged for\r\na captain attached to a military mission bound for Washington by plane\r\nto deliver the manuscript personally to Bird. The story was still hot\r\nwhen the script reached New York. Bird sold the serial rights to a big\r\nnational weekly that same day for thirty thousand dollars. A lecture\r\nagency cabled offering a guarantee of a fantastic sum for a three-month\r\nlecture tour. A book club chose _The Revenger_, the critics sang its\r\npraises, and Bird bought himself a house in the country.\r\n\r\nHall quit his job and made the lecture tour and wound up with a fat bank\r\naccount and a permanent appreciation of the value of a chance plop in\r\nthe ocean. For the first time in his life, he found himself with enough\r\nmoney to do exactly what he wanted to do. The Army doctors had shown him\r\nto the nearest door, but he had offers from magazines and syndicates to\r\nreturn to the war zones, and the radio wanted him as a commentator.\r\n\r\nIt was Bird who first learned of Hall's new plans. And Bird understood.\r\n\"The Spanish War was round one,\" Hall told him. \"South America was one\r\nof the stakes. The Falange had an organization in the Latin countries.\r\nThe Heinies used to brag about it to me in San Sebastian. I'm going to\r\nSouth America to see it for myself. Maybe there's a book in it, maybe\r\nthere isn't. I can afford to find out.\"\r\n\r\nCuba had been the first stop on this odyssey. There Hall had had some\r\ntough sledding, met some Spanish Republicans who knew him from Madrid,\r\nwon the aid of a group of young Cuban officials and written two angry\r\nand documented magazine pieces.\r\n\r\nFrom Havana, Hall had flown to Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nHall had stopped thinking. The reverie into which the lieutenant had\r\nplunged him passed into a rapt consideration of the imperfect smoke\r\nrings he was blowing toward the ceiling.\r\n\r\nDickenson joined him. \"Well?\" he asked. \"Is it San Hermano tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to see you leave. We figured you'd stay for at least a month.\r\nWhat's so urgent in San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I mean to find out. All I know is what I read in the\r\npapers.\" He handed the Governor two copies of the San Hermano\r\n_Imparcial_ he had found on a library table in the reception room while\r\nhaving a cocktail before dinner. They were the papers which had made him\r\ncall Harris at Panair.\r\n\r\nThe first issue was three weeks old. It described the visit of an\r\nAmerican Good-Will Commission to San Hermano, and told how the mission\r\nwas received by Enrique Gamburdo, the Vice-President, rather than by\r\nAnibal Tabio, the President. In an oblique manner, the story went on to\r\ndeny the \"widespread rumor\" that Tabio had deliberately insulted the\r\nAmericans by not receiving them personally.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the way they denied the rumor,\" Hall said. \"I know that\r\nthe paper is _imparcial_ on the fascist side only.\"\r\n\r\nThe other edition of _Imparcial_ was three days old. It was the latest\r\ncopy available. It carried as its lead story the news that since Tabio's\r\nillness had taken a drastic turn for the worse, Gamburdo had prevailed\r\nupon a great Spanish doctor, Varela Ansaldo, to fly from Philadelphia to\r\nSan Hermano in an attempt to save the President's life.\r\n\r\n\"And?\" the Governor asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure. But it looks to me like a deliberate attempt to lay a\r\nsmelly egg in Tabio's nest. Anyway, I did a little checking with Harris.\r\nI figured I'd be able to meet Ansaldo's plane, and I was right. The San\r\nHermano Clipper overnights in San Juan, you know. Ansaldo is sleeping at\r\nthe Escambrun tonight. Tomorrow we'll board the ship for San Hermano\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still don't get it, Matt. Do you know this Ansaldo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But he's evidently been invited to San Hermano by Gamburdo. And I\r\nfound out a few things about Gamburdo in Havana,\" Hall said. \"Some\r\ntop-ranking Falange chiefs in the Americas always spoke highly of him in\r\ntheir letters. Especially the letters marked confidential.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't. You know I'm not crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Matt, neither is Gamburdo crazy. He wouldn't dare do what you're\r\nimplying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. But I'm not thinking of Gamburdo as much as I am of Tabio. I\r\nlike Anibal Tabio, like him a lot. I met him for the first time in\r\nGeneva in '35, when he was Foreign Minister. Then I met him again in\r\n'36, when he and Vayo and Litvinov were hammering away at the fat cats\r\nbacking Franco. He was a real guy, Dick. One of the few statesmen alive\r\nwho not only knew that the earth is round but also that the people on\r\nthis round earth like to eat and wear decent clothes and send their kids\r\nto college.\r\n\r\n\"I remember how in '37, after Halifax yawned all through his speech and\r\nthen led the rest of the delegates in voting against Vayo's proposals,\r\nTabio sat down with me in a little bar and ordered a light beer and told\r\nme very quietly that this was his cue. 'I must go home,' he told me,\r\n'and see that it doesn't happen to my country.' That's how he pulled up\r\nhis stakes and went back to San Hermano and ran for President.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's good, Matt. I know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's damn good. He's the best of the anti-fascist leaders on the\r\nContinent right now, Dick. He deserves all the help he isn't getting\r\nfrom us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor put the paper down with a sigh. \"I'll tell you a secret,\r\nMatt,\" he said. \"But it's really secret. You know that there's going to\r\nbe a Pan-American conference on foreign policy in Havana in five weeks.\r\nWell, some of the smarter heads in Washington are getting worried. We're\r\nsending a delegation to the conference to ask all the nations down here\r\nto break with the Axis. And some of us are afraid that if Tabio\r\nis--well, not able to pick the San Hermano delegation, his government\r\nwill remain neutral.\"\r\n\r\nHall stood up and began pacing between the couch and the chair. He\r\npulled out a large white handkerchief and mopped the sweat on his face,\r\nhis neck, his quivering hands. \"God damn them all to hell,\" he said,\r\n\"they're moving in on us in our own backyard and when you try to say a\r\nword in Washington they spit in your eye and tell you Franco is a\r\nneutral and a friend.\"\r\n\r\nDickenson drew a deep breath, exhaled slowly and audibly. \"What's it all\r\nabout, Matt?\" he asked, softly. \"Where does San Hermano come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know a mucking thing yet. All I know is that it stinks to high\r\nheaven. Listen, Dick, I'm not crazy. You know that. In Washington they\r\nact as if I'm crazy or worse when I try to tell them.\" Hall put his hand\r\nto the twitching right side of his face as if to keep it still. His\r\noutburst had completely dried his throat. He went to the sideboard,\r\nthrew some ice cubes into a giant glass, poured soda over the ice.\r\n\r\nThe Governor watched him swallow the contents in huge gulps. \"Better sit\r\ndown, Matt,\" he said. \"You'll blow a valve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" he said. He put the glass down on the floor, ran the\r\nhandkerchief over his neck. \"There's one thing I do know, and it's\r\nkilling me. I know the Falange is in this. It's all I have to know. I\r\nremember reading a fascist paper in jail in San Sebastian. There was a\r\nbig map on the back page, a map showing Spain as the center of the\r\nSpanish World. An artist had superimposed the five arrows of the Falange\r\nover the face of Spain. The article under the map said that while one of\r\nthe arrows pointed to Madrid, two pointed to the Philippines and the\r\nothers pointed to Latin America. They weren't kidding, Dick. When the\r\nJaps marched into Manila they decorated the Philippine Falange for the\r\nfifth-column job the Falangistas performed for Hirohito. And there are\r\ntwenty Falangist cells in Latin America for every one cell they had in\r\nManila on December 6, 1941.\r\n\r\n\"And why not, Dick? It's the Germans who've always run the Falange.\r\nToday they run Spain. And they also run the Exterior Falange set-up.\r\nMaybe Falangismo as a philosophy is phony as all hell, and maybe its\r\ncreed of Hispanidad, with all its blah about Latin America returning to\r\nthe Spanish Empire, is just as phony. Maybe it doesn't make sense to us\r\ngringos. I'll grant that. But it is a nice Nazi horse on the dumb\r\nSpanish aristocrats who do Hitler's dirty work in the Americas. In\r\nGerman hands it's one of the dynamics of this war. I've seen it in\r\noperation, and I know. It's the gimmick that makes rich Spaniards fuel\r\nand hide submarines in the Caribbean--you know that for a fact yourself.\r\nIt's the new amalgam which makes 'em look to Holy Mother Spain as the\r\ncore of a new empire, it's ...\"\r\n\r\n\"But granting all this, Matt, why must you go to San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\nHall swallowed some soda. He put the glass back on the floor, grabbed\r\nthe San Hermano _Imparcial_ from the Governor's hands. Slowly, he\r\ncrushed the paper and held it in front of Dickenson's face. \"Do you know\r\nwho publishes _El Imparcial_?\" he asked. \"I'll tell you. It's a fascist\r\nnamed Fernandez. In San Sebastian, during the war, he strutted all over\r\ntown in a Falange officer's uniform browning his nose with all the\r\ntop-ranking lice, the Germans, the Italians, the Franco crowd. He was\r\nthere for months, making radio speeches and public appearances and\r\ngetting cramps in the right arm from holding it up in the stiff-arm\r\nsalute. I saw him a dozen times, if I saw him once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jose Fernandez? I met him at a conference in Rio. He seemed like a\r\npleasant enough chap,\" the Governor said.\r\n\r\n\"They're all pleasant. They can afford to be. You never met Ribbentrop\r\nand Otto Abetz, Dick. They were the most charming men in Europe before\r\nthe war. But listen, last week in Havana I looked at a collection of\r\npictures taken from the files of the chief of the Falange delegation for\r\nthe Americas. There was one picture of a banquet held by the Falange in\r\nSan Hermano late in 1936. It was a secret affair, only insiders and\r\nleaders. And there, on the dais, was Licenciado Enrique Gamburdo, big as\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. It was a secret affair, all right. Not a word in the papers, and\r\neveryone present sworn to secrecy by a Bishop who was among the honored\r\nguests.\" Hall dried the sweat on his hands again. \"But always at these\r\naffairs there's a man with a camera. Usually he's a Gestapo Heinie.\r\nSometimes he's a Gestapo Spaniard or even a Gestapo Latin-American. A\r\npicture, just one picture, has to be made. It goes to the German consul\r\nor the Falange chief of the country and they have to forward it to the\r\nIbero-American Institute in Berlin. The pictures back up the reports,\r\nyou see, and, besides, when you have a picture of a deacon trucking with\r\na doxie in a bordello it's a good thing to threaten to show the deacon's\r\nwife if the deacon decides to return to the paths of righteousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a good reporter. My job is to remember unimportant things, and to\r\nremember them well when they become important. If I'm wrong, I'll find\r\nout for myself in San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor accepted one of Hall's cigars. \"God,\" he said, \"I hope\r\nyou're wrong, Matt.\"\r\n\r\nLater, back in his hotel room, Hall stripped to his shorts, ran cold\r\nwater over his wrists and the back of his neck. He poured some Haitian\r\nrum into a glass, drenched it with soda from the pink-and-green night\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nOutside, in the darkness, four boys were playing tag. Hall listened to\r\nthe whispered padding of their bare feet as they flew from cobblestones\r\nto trolley tracks. He went to the wrought-iron balcony, stood there\r\nwatching the undersized kids chasing each other up and down the narrow\r\nstreet. Two freighters rode at anchor in the harbor, their gray noses\r\npointing at the pink Customs House. A soldier lurched down the street,\r\nbarely missing the feet of an old _jibaro_ sleeping in the doorway of a\r\ndark store.\r\n\r\nHall returned to the desk. He wrote a short note to a friend in a\r\ngovernment bureau in Havana--merely to say that he was leaving for San\r\nHermano and that for the time being could be reached in care of Pan\r\nAmerican Airways there--and a similar note to Bird. He decided to let\r\nhis other letters wait until he reached San Hermano.\r\n\r\nThe kids who were playing tag disappeared. The only noise which broke\r\nthe silence of the night now was the soft pounding of the presses in the\r\nnewspaper plant up the street. Hall sealed his letters and started to\r\npack his bags.\r\n\r\nThe four boys reappeared with a whoop. They carried freshly printed\r\nmagazines this time, and, as they ran down the street, first one then\r\nanother took up the mournful cry: \"_Puerto Rico Ilustrado!\r\nIl-us-traaa-dooohhh!_\" They were no longer to be seen when Hall ran out\r\nto the balcony to look.\r\n\r\nHe took a cold shower, then lit one of his Havanas. The mosquito net\r\nwhich completely covered his bed annoyed him. He put out the light in\r\norder not to see the bars of the net frame. Silently, he railed against\r\nthe sugar planters and their kept politicos for leaving the island prey\r\nto malaria. He had to remind himself that the net was his protection\r\nagainst malaria before he could crawl under the frame, but even then he\r\nclimbed into bed with a cigar in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe cigar was his protection, his secret weapon, against the\r\nclaustrophobia the _mosquitero_ gave him. There were no cigars in\r\nFranco's prisons, no cigars and no cool sheets and coiled spring\r\nmattresses, no soft breezes floating in from a harbor as ancient as the\r\nConquistadores.\r\n\r\nHe lay under the net, naked and uncovered, blowing smoke rings at the\r\ncross bars above him. He thought of Anibal Tabio in Geneva, thin as a\r\nreed, his slender hand pointing to the pile of German and Italian\r\ndocuments del Vayo had brought to the League. He thought of Tabio and he\r\nthought of his three years in Spain and, thinking, he got worked up all\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to think of the months of being trapped like an animal\r\nin a cage, of being pushed around by smirking men who had the guns, of\r\nwatching the metal inkstand in the hands of the German major the second\r\nbefore it crashed into his own face. No, it was not easy, and the memory\r\nof San Sebastian led to the scarlet memory of the afternoon on the\r\nMalecon in Havana less than a month ago when Sanchez had pointed out to\r\nhim two leaders of the Falange at a cafe table and he started out to\r\nbash their heads together right then and there. Luis and Felix had had\r\nto grab him and wrestle him to the sidewalk, laughing and playing at\r\nbeing just three jolly boys who'd had a drink too much instead of two\r\nSpanish Republicans keeping a frenzied American from killing two men\r\nthey detested and would gladly have killed themselves.\r\n\r\nHall sat up, shaking, covered with sweat. He crawled out of bed, stood\r\nbarefooted on the tiled floor. An overwhelming feeling of loneliness\r\ncame over him. He was lonely in his person, lonelier still in his\r\ninability to make any of his own people understand the gnawing hates and\r\nfears which had taken him first to Havana and then to San Juan and\r\nnow--_quien sabe_? And then, realizing with an amused start that he was\r\nthinking in Spanish, he tore the net off the bed, threw the cigar away,\r\nand went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter two_\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Varela Ansaldo was traveling with his assistant, a young Dr. Marina,\r\nan American nurse named Geraldine Olmstead, and a Dominican passport.\r\nThis much Hall was able to observe at the ground station, before the\r\npassengers for San Hermano and way points boarded the Stratoliner.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican passport interested Hall. He knew that the passports were\r\nfor sale at an average price of a thousand dollars. Refugees starved and\r\nborrowed and sold their souls to scrape together a thousand dollars for\r\none of the precious passports. When you met a Spaniard with a new\r\nDominican passport, you seldom had to ask questions; you knew you were\r\nmeeting a man whose life was not worth a nickel in Spain. And yet, in\r\nthe day-old issue of _Time_ the Clipper had flown in from Miami, the\r\nbiography of Ansaldo carried no hint of the doctor's being in disfavor\r\nwith Franco. Nor did the biography mention the physician's Dominican\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nHall read the _Time_ biography again. _Scrupulously impartial during the\r\nSpanish Civil War, Ansaldo took no sides, remaining at his post as a\r\nhealer under both nationalist and loyalist flags. With the end of war,\r\nAnsaldo accepted a Chair offered by the Penn Medical Institute in\r\nPhiladelphia, assuming new position in October, 1939._ The story went on\r\nto describe some of the new operations Ansaldo had since performed.\r\n\r\nHall unbuckled his seat belt. He had a single seat on the left of the\r\nplane, the third seat from the front. Ansaldo's nurse had the seat in\r\nfront of his. She sat across the aisle from Marina and Ansaldo, who\r\nshared a double seat. Hall sat opposite a pink-cheeked Dutchman of sixty\r\nwho shared a seat with a very dark Brazilian. A State Department courier\r\nhad the seat in front of the nurse. The other passengers included the\r\nwife of an American Army officer, some Panair officials, two Standard\r\nOil engineers, and some quiet Latin American government officials on\r\ntheir way back from Washington.\r\n\r\nMost of the passengers, now that the plane had gained altitude, were\r\ntrying to sleep. The little Hollander was wide awake, virtuously and\r\nhappily wide awake with the morning heartiness of a man who has been\r\ngoing to bed and rising early all of his life. He beamed at Hall. \"I see\r\nyou and I are the only ones who had a good night's sleep, Mr. Hall.\"\r\nThen, laughing, he explained that he had recognized Hall from the\r\npicture on the jacket of his book before he had even heard his name\r\nannounced by the steward on boarding ship. His accent was slight, but\r\ndefinite.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday,\" he said, gesturing at Hall's seat, \"Miss Prescott--a\r\ncharming lady, by the way--and today another American writer. Ah, well,\r\nthe damn wheel turns and comes up twice with the same value. Oh, I\r\nforgot. My name is Wilhelm Androtten.\"\r\n\r\nHall extended his hand across the aisle, gripped the hand Androtten\r\noffered him. It was a pudgy little hand, soft and white and pink.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Androtten sighed. \"I have quite a hell of a story of my own to\r\ntell about enemy actions. I too have been an actor in the drama. But of\r\ncourse I'm not a writer. Ah no, Mr. Hall,\" he waved a stiff little index\r\nfinger back and forth in front of his glowing face, \"I'm not going to\r\nsuggest that you write my story. To me it is important as hell. But to\r\nthe world? It is not as dramatic as the sinking of the _Revenger_. A\r\nthousand times no!\"\r\n\r\nThe Hollander pulled an immense old-fashioned silver cigarette case from\r\nthe pocket of his brown-linen suit. \"Have an American cigarette? Good.\r\nYes, mine is only the story of how the damn Japanese Army drove a poor\r\ncoffee planter off his estates and then out of Java. And that is all,\r\nsir, except that as you may have guessed--I was the planter. Now I am,\r\nso to speak, a real Flying Dutchman, flying everywhere to buy coffee\r\nfrom the other planters and then flying everywhere to sell it again. But\r\nI try to be jolly as hell and to bear my load like a Dutchman should,\r\nMr. Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"That _is_ a story, Mr. Androtten,\" Hall said. \"A real one.\" The strong\r\nlight above the clouds rasped his sleep-hungry eyes. He put on his dark\r\nglasses, leaned his head back against the padded roll of the reclining\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think my story is worth while, Mr. Hall? I would be\r\nhonored as hell to tell you the whole story with all the damn facts, if\r\nyou desire. I ... Are you getting off at Caracas?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'm sorry. I go all the way through to San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, Mr. Hall. I go to San Hermano myself. Do you know the Monte Azul\r\nbean, sir? It's richer than the Java. A little Monte Azul, a little\r\nBogota, some choice Brazilians--and you have a roast that will delight\r\nthe rarest palates. Yes, San Hermano is my destination. San Hermano and\r\nthe damn Monte Azul bean.\"\r\n\r\nHall gave up trying to stifle a series of yawns. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.\r\n\"I guess I didn't get enough sleep after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please sleep,\" Androtten said. \"We'll have plenty of time to talk in\r\nSan Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Plenty of time.\" Hall opened the collar of his shirt, sank into a\r\nlight sleep almost at once. He slept for over an hour, waking when the\r\nStandard Oil engineers in the rear seats laughed at a joke told by the\r\nArmy officer's wife. The steady drone of the engines, the continuing\r\nsharpness of the light made remaining awake difficult. Hall closed his\r\neyes again but there was no sleep.\r\n\r\nAndrotten and the Brazilian had found a common tongue, French, and in\r\nthe joy of this discovery had also discovered a common subject. The\r\nBrazilian was holding forth on the exotic virtues of one rare coffee,\r\nthe huge diamond on his finger ring catching and distributing the light\r\nas he gestured. Androtten was trying to describe the various blends of\r\nJava.\r\n\r\nHall thought of Ansaldo and Marina and the nurse. Marina was about\r\nthirty, too dapper, too fastidious, his plaid sports jacket fitting too\r\nsnugly over his rounded hips. On boarding the plane, the nurse had\r\nbrushed against his arm, which he withdrew with a subconscious gesture\r\nof revulsion. Hall watched him now, buffing his nails with a chamois\r\nboard. Ansaldo had also awakened, was reading one of the pile of medical\r\nmagazines he had carried into the plane. The nurse was a blank, so far.\r\nAll he could see of her was the soft roll of strawberry hair. She had a\r\nfew faint freckles on her nose and full lips and it was ten to one that\r\nshe was from the Midwest. But a blank.\r\n\r\nThe older doctor, Ansaldo, was about fifty, and had a stiff correctness\r\nthat Hall had noticed immediately in the airport. He wore glasses whose\r\nhorn rims were of an exaggerated thickness. His iron-gray hair, cut\r\nshort and combed straight back, had an air of almost surgical neatness.\r\nHe had the long horse face of an El Greco Cardinal, and behaved even\r\ntoward his assistant and his nurse with a detached politeness. Marina's\r\nobvious and fawning devotion to the older man seemed to bounce off\r\nAnsaldo without effect. Hall put him down as an extremely cold fish, but\r\na cold fish who would bear watching for reasons Hall himself could not\r\nquite define.\r\n\r\nWhen the plane stopped in Caracas for refueling, Ansaldo, carrying a\r\nthick medical journal with his finger still marking his place, took a\r\nslow walk in the shade, Marina following at his heels like a puppy. Hall\r\ngot out and lit a cigar and when he noticed the nurse looking at the\r\nexhibit of rugs and dolls set up in a stand at the edge of the airfield\r\nhe walked to her side. \"Indian-craft stuff,\" he said. \"If you'd care to,\r\nI'll be your interpreter.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl took off her dark glasses, looked at Hall for a moment, and\r\nthen put them on again. \"I can't see too well with these darn things,\"\r\nshe laughed. \"Do you think I could get a small rug without giving up my\r\nright arm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your right arm is safe with me around, Madam. Perhaps you never heard\r\nof me, Madam, but in these parts I'm known as Trader Hall. Matthew\r\nHall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're hired. My name is Jerry Olmstead.\"\r\n\r\nThey sauntered over to the stand. The afternoon sun ignited the fires in\r\nher hair. She was taller than most women, and though her white sharkskin\r\nsuit was well creased from travel, Hall could see that she had the kind\r\nof full shapely figure which made poolroom loafers whistle and trusted\r\nbank employees forget the percentages against embezzlers. Feature for\r\nfeature, Jerry Olmstead's was not the face that would have launched even\r\na hundred ships. Her forehead was too high, and it bulged a bit. Her\r\nblue eyes were a shade too pale for the frank healthiness of her skin.\r\nHer nose was straight and well shaped, but almost indelicately large.\r\nWhen she smiled, she displayed two rows of glistening healthy teeth\r\nwhich were anything but even and yet not uneven enough to be termed\r\ncrooked.\r\n\r\nHall helped her select a small rug, agreed at once to the price asked by\r\nthe Indian woman at the stand, and then had a long discussion in Spanish\r\nwith the peddler about the state of affairs at the airport before giving\r\nher the money. \"You see,\" he said to Jerry, \"unless you bargain with\r\nthese Indians, you're bound to get robbed.\" The rug cost Jerry something\r\nlike sixty cents in American money.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be able to pick up some wonderful beaten-silver things in San\r\nHermano,\" Hall said. \"I'd be glad to show you around when we get there.\r\nIn the meantime, can I get you a drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd love one.\"\r\n\r\nThe only drinks for sale in the canteen were cold ginger ale and\r\nlemonade. They had the ginger ale, and Hall learned that this was the\r\ngirl's first trip out of the United States. \"It's all so different!\" she\r\nsaid, and Hall thought he would grimace but then the girl smiled happily\r\nand he watched the skin wrinkle faintly at the bridge of her nose and he\r\nsmiled with her. \"You'll like San Hermano,\" he said. \"And I'd like to\r\nshow it to you when we get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you spend much time there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a few days. I took a freighter back from Cairo two years ago and\r\nit put in at San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, what do you do, anyway?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"Don't sound so surprised. I'm a newspaperman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you a war correspondent?\"\r\n\r\nHall nodded. \"I even wrote a book.\"\r\n\r\nJerry looked into her glass. \"I know it sounds terrible,\" she said, \"but\r\nI haven't read a book in years. Was yours about the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's talk about it in San Hermano. Do I show you the town?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"That bell is for us,\" Hall said. \"We'd better get back to the plane.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the canteen. Ansaldo and Marina were still walking in a slow\r\ncircle. \"Come on,\" Jerry said. \"Meet my boss.\"\r\n\r\nShe approached Ansaldo. \"Dr. Ansaldo,\" she said, \"I'd like you to meet\r\nMr. Matthew Hall. He's a newspaperman from the States. And this is Dr.\r\nMarina.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall is showing me around San Hermano when we get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"How nice,\" Ansaldo said, and from his tone Hall knew that he meant\r\nnothing of the sort.\r\n\r\n\"But now we must hurry,\" Ansaldo said. \"The plane is about to depart.\"\r\nHe took Jerry's arm and they walked on ahead of Marina and Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Senor Hall, if you are going to write about the doctor's forthcoming\r\noperation,\" Marina said, \"I would gladly help you. The doctor is the\r\ngreatest surgeon of our times, perhaps, who knows, of all times. He is\r\nmagnificent. In his hands, the scalpel is an instrument of divinity. It\r\nis more, it is divinity itself. I must tell you the story of the\r\ndoctor's greatest operations, although all of them are great. I will\r\nhelp you. You will write a great article about the great operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very grateful to you, doctor. I hope that in San Hermano you will\r\nhave enough time to give me your counsel. After you, doctor.\" Hall took\r\na last drag at his cigar as Marina climbed the plane ladder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a mountain--the Monte Azul which produced the beans of\r\nAndrotten's rhapsodies--and a plateau in the clouds and below the\r\nplateau lay the ocean and the city of San Hermano. The lights were going\r\non in the city when Flight Eighteen ended on the airport in the plateau,\r\nfor the city was five miles farther from the sinking sun of the moment.\r\nOn the plateau, the airport lights blended with the brown-orange shades\r\nof dusk; in the city the lights cut through the classic blackness of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA smartly dressed colonel and a top-hatted functionary of the Foreign\r\nOffice were waiting with two black limousines for the Ansaldo party. The\r\nman from the Foreign Office had cleared all the passport and customs\r\nformalities. Jerry had just enough time to tell Hall that she and the\r\ndoctors were to stay at the Bolivar before the cars started down the\r\nwinding hill to San Hermano.\r\n\r\nHall rode to town with the rest of the passengers in the sleek Panair\r\nbus. He and Androtten were also bound for the Bolivar.\r\n\r\nRiding into the valley, the bus descended into the night. It was a night\r\nmade blacker by the war, as were the nights in San Juan and Havana and\r\nNew York. San Hermano was the capital of a nation still at peace, but\r\nthe maws of the war across the seas reached for the oil and coal of the\r\nworld, and San Hermano could not escape this world. Three lights in\r\nevery four on the Plaza de la Republica were out, for coal and oil\r\nfurnished the power for the city's electricity. Two years earlier, Hall\r\nhad asked Anibal Tabio why coal and oil had to turn the city's dynamos\r\nwhen the nation abounded in thousands of mountain streams which could be\r\nharnessed by men with slide rules and logarithm tables, and the gentle\r\nPresident had answered him in a sentence. \"Because, my dear Hall, San\r\nHermano has been in the twentieth century for barely a decade, while\r\nyour own nation has been in our century for forty years.\" And tonight,\r\nlooking at the ancient Plaza from the window of his room on the third\r\nfloor of the Bolivar, Hall remembered Tabio's words with disturbing\r\nclarity.\r\n\r\nFrom the balcony of his hotel room, Hall could see both San Hermanos,\r\nthe Old City and the New. Everyone spoke of the two cities in these\r\nterms--the geographers, the tourist guides, the inveterate _Hermanitos_\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Old San Hermano had been founded by the Conquistadores in the\r\nsixteenth century, a walled speck on the shores of an ocean, a fortress\r\nand a thatched church, a handful of flimsy huts. In a century, the\r\nthatched church became a proud, gloomy Cathedral; one of the walls was\r\nknocked down, and in its place was the cobbled Plaza de Fernando e\r\nIsabel. The Plaza was Spain in the New World; opening on to its cobbles\r\nstood the huge Moorish stone palaces designed by architects brought over\r\nfrom Seville, the palace of the Captains-General who served as colonial\r\ngovernors, the fortified mint, the Cathedral, the home of the Governor's\r\nelder brother, the Duke of La Runa. Enslaved Indians and later chained\r\nNegroes from the African coasts had carried on their backs the square\r\nstones Spanish masons cut and formed for the edifices of the Plaza,\r\nfirst the Cathedral, next the Governor's Palace and the Mint.\r\n\r\nThen, in the days of Hidalgo, Bolivar, and San Martin, the ancient Plaza\r\nof the Conquistadores became the Plaza de la Republica, and for a few\r\nglorious hours the new nation was in tune with its century. But the\r\ngreat Liberators of the times were to die in embittered exile, far from\r\nthe scenes of their brightest victories. For one swing of the pendulum\r\nthe liberated lands teetered on the dizzy heights of freedom, and then\r\nthe pendulum swung back and stopped swinging for a century. The land\r\nremained in the hands of the Spanish nobles, and they won their war\r\nagainst the Industrial Revolution, and all that remained of the hour of\r\ntriumph was the name the Liberators had given the old Plaza and a hollow\r\nRepublic controlled by the landowners.\r\n\r\nIn ways more subtle, but no less real than the old ways, the Republic\r\nbecame a colony again, except that the nation was no longer ruled by a\r\ncrown but by new and even more potent symbols: the sign of the pound,\r\nthe sign of the dollar, the sign of the franc. The new order brought a\r\nnew San Hermano, a new Western city built around the rims of the old\r\nfortress seaport. It was a strange and often beautiful melange of French\r\nvillas and British banks and American skyscrapers and German town\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe old Constitution of the Liberators gave way to a series of native\r\ndictators who waxed rich as the servants of the foreign owners of the\r\nmetals and minerals discovered under the nation's soil, of the foreign\r\nbusiness men who never saw San Hermano but built vast abattoirs near the\r\nwharves where skinny _Hermanitos_ earned a few pennies a day for\r\nslaughtering and then loading endless herds of native cattle in the dark\r\nholds of foreign ships.\r\n\r\nThey were ruthless men, the dictators who sat in San Hermano as\r\npro-Consuls of the foreigners and the landowners, ruthless men who, for\r\ntheir share of the profits of the foreigners, of the endless rivers of\r\npesetas the landowners sent to Spain, maintained armies of cutthroats to\r\nput down any attempt at rebellion against the new existing order.\r\n\r\nThe last of these dictators to sit in San Hermano was General Agusto\r\nSegura. More than a decade had passed since Segura had died in bed and a\r\njunta of professors and miners wrested the control of the nation from\r\nSegura's henchmen. There had been little bloodshed when the Junta took\r\nover; after thirty years, the Segura regime, or what was left of it, had\r\njust collapsed of its own rottenness.\r\n\r\nHall thought of Segura, and the state he had ruled, and then, again\r\nthinking about Tabio while he stared into the shadows of the darkened\r\nPlaza de la Republica, Hall remembered Tabio's quiet remark about his\r\ncountry's having been in the twentieth century for barely a decade. A\r\nslim decade, which began with a world in confusion and was now ending\r\nwith a world in flames. But if the country weathered these flames, it\r\nwould be because Tabio, instead of running for the Presidency after the\r\nrevolution which swept out the remnants of Segurista power, had chosen\r\nto serve as Minister of Education for nearly ten years. Hall was willing\r\nto stake his life on this, ready to bet that the phenomenal free\r\neducational system Tabio had set up for children and adults would, in\r\nthe final analysis, be one of the nation's chief bulwarks against\r\nfascism.\r\n\r\nHe changed his clothes and went out for a walk through the crooked\r\nstreets of Old San Hermano before turning in. Many lights were burning\r\nin the fourth floor of the Presidencia, the floor on which the President\r\nhad his apartment. Military guards were standing listlessly at the\r\nentrances to the gilded building.\r\n\r\nHall walked along the Plaza until he came to the Calle de Virtudes,\r\nwhich led to a little cafe on the street opposite the rear entrance of\r\nthe Presidencia. It had no windows but giant shutters which were folded\r\nagainst the wall when the cafe was open for business. The cafe itself\r\nstood on a corner, the sidewalks on both sides of the place covered with\r\ntables and chairs. Wooden lattice fences, painted a bright orange,\r\nscreened the tables from the pedestrian's section of the sidewalk.\r\nInside, near the bar itself, two boys with guitars were playing and\r\nsinging the tragi-comic peasant songs of the south.\r\n\r\nHe took a sidewalk table, ordered a meat pie and a bottle of beer, and\r\nthen went to the small hotel next to the cafe to buy a sheet of paper,\r\nan envelope, and an air-mail stamp. He asked for a telephone book,\r\nlooked up the names under Gomez, copied the address of one Juan Gomez,\r\nand returned to his table. There he bought a newspaper from a boy\r\npeddling the latest edition of the evening. The front page carried a\r\nstory about Ansaldo: the distinguished visiting medico was to spend the\r\nnext day conferring with local doctors who had been treating the\r\nPresident. In one of the back pages, under Arrivals, there was a line\r\nabout the illustrious author and war correspondent Dr. M. Gall who\r\nreached San Hermano by Clipper; Dr. Gall was the noted author of _The\r\nRevenger_, even now being produced in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThe paper was put aside for the meat pie. When he was done with the\r\nfood, Hall pushed his plates away and spread his sheet of lined writing\r\npaper on the table before him. He called for some ink, filled his\r\nfountain pen, and wrote a letter in Spanish to a \"Dear Pedro.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a rambling, innocuous letter which started out with family gossip\r\nabout a forthcoming marriage of a cousin, the marriage prospects of the\r\nwriter's eligible daughter, the letter received from Cousin Hernando who\r\nwas happy on his new ranch and whose good wife was expecting another\r\nchild soon. Then the letter went on to say that \"I suppose you have read\r\nin the Havana papers that our President is ailing. Today there arrived\r\nin our city the distinguished Spanish doctor Varela Ansaldo. He is to\r\ntreat the President. Perhaps I am very stupid, but is he not the surgeon\r\nwho operated so well on the throat of your dear Uncle Carlos?\" The\r\nletter then continued on for another page of family gossip and regards\r\nand requests that Pedro embrace a whole list of dear cousins and aunts.\r\nIt was signed, simply, \"Juanito.\"\r\n\r\nHall read the letter twice, sealed it, and addressed the envelope to\r\nPedro de Aragon, Apartado 1724, La Habana, Cuba. Pedro de Aragon was a\r\nmyth. Mail at this box was picked up by Santiago Iglesias, an officer of\r\nthe Spanish Republican Army whom Hall had met again in Havana. Iglesias\r\ndid at one time have an uncle named Carlos; the uncle had died on the\r\nJarama front from a fascist bullet that tore through his throat and\r\nkilled him instantly. Hall had arranged to write to Iglesias under names\r\nchosen from the phone books of different cities if the need arose. He\r\nscribbled the name and address of Juan Gomez on the back of the\r\nenvelope, left some money on the table, and walked back to the Plaza.\r\nThere he dropped the letter in a mailbox and continued on his way to the\r\nBolivar.\r\n\r\nThere was a new clerk on duty when Hall reached the hotel, a wiry man of\r\nforty-odd whose yellow silk shirt clashed with both his black mohair\r\njacket and his long, lined face. Hall asked for the key to Room 306 in\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nThe clerk cleared his throat and answered in English. \"There was\r\nmessages,\" he said, handing the key to Hall with a sheaf of slips. \"And\r\nalso this.\" From under the counter he drew a sealed letter written on\r\nheavy paper and bearing the neat blue imprint of the American Embassy at\r\nSan Hermano on the envelope.\r\n\r\nHall frowned and tore open the envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Senorita the Ambassador's daughter telephoned twice,\" the clerk said.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's on this slip, Mr. Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks again.\" He read the few handwritten lines of the letter. It was\r\nan invitation from the Ambassador's daughter, Margaret Skidmore, to\r\nattend the Ambassador's party at the Embassy on the 5th. That was two\r\nnights off.\r\n\r\nThere was a message from Jerry Olmstead. She had phoned from her room to\r\nleave word that she had retired for the evening but would meet him in\r\nthe dining room at ten for breakfast. Hall noticed that the clerk was\r\nwatching him intently as he read the girl's message, but when he started\r\nto read the next slip the clerk interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"It's from Mr. Roger Fielding,\" he said. \"I took the message myself. He\r\nis a very nice person. An Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the slip the clerk had written, \"Mr. Fielding is very sorry you were\r\nnot in because it is important. He will call you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Fernando Souza,\" the clerk said, extending his hand. \"I am\r\nvery happy to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nHall put the papers down on the desk and shook hands with the clerk.\r\nThey had a meaningless chat about the rigors of wartime travel and the\r\ndimout in peaceful San Hermano and Hall learned that the Englishman\r\nFielding was in the tall Lonja de Comercio building and very decent. \"I\r\nhave been at this desk for many years and in this position one meets\r\nmany people,\" the clerk said, and he went on amiably chatting about what\r\none could see on different one-day tours from the city.\r\n\r\n\"It is very sad about the President,\" Hall said, and then the clerk\r\nreddened and he forgot to speak English. \"The Educator must live,\"\r\nFernando Souza said. \"If the Educator goes, the nation goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Hall said. \"I admire Don Anibal greatly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Momentico, Senor. El telefono._\" After nine, the night clerk had to\r\nhandle the switchboard at the Bolivar.\r\n\r\nIt was Fielding again. Hall picked up the phone on the marble counter.\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Fielding,\" he said, \"I'm sorry I missed your first call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, old man. Not at all. Damned decent of you to answer my call\r\nnow, what with the hour and all that.\" The voice which came through\r\nHall's receiver was the raspy, crotchety, bluff voice of a movie\r\nBritisher, the diction almost too good to be true. \"I must say it was a\r\ngood surprise, a good surprise. The paper tonight, I mean, even if they\r\ncalled you Dr. Gall. But what can they do if the H is silent in\r\nSpanish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been called Gall before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you have, of course you have.\" The man at the other end of\r\nthe wire cleared his throat with a loud harumph. \"What I'm calling\r\nabout, Mr. Hall, is--well, damn it all, what with the war and all that I\r\nguess we have a right to keep a tired traveler from going to bed the\r\nsecond his plane reaches the end of his road. I think it rather urgent\r\nwe have a bit of coffee and a bit of a chat tonight. Really, old man, I\r\nthink it is urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm at home now,\" Fielding said. \"I can get to Old San Hermano in an\r\nhour. Souza can tell you how to get to my office. Nice chap, that Souza.\r\nStraight as a die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"The office is about ten minutes from the Bolivar by cab, if Souza can\r\nget you a cab. Suppose I ring you at the Bolivar when I reach the\r\noffice?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be fine. See you soon.\" Hall put the phone down and turned to\r\nSouza. \"He said you are straight as a die,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fielding is a very decent Englishman,\" Souza said. He offered no\r\nfurther information about Roger Fielding, and Hall decided against\r\nasking any questions.\r\n\r\n\"If you are meeting him at his office, I had better get you a cab,\"\r\nSouza said, and then, sensing the hesitation in Hall's eyes, he quickly\r\nadded, \"it would be better. Walking at night is dangerous, especially in\r\nOld San Hermano, since the lights went out. There are many--accidents.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" Hall said. \"Look, I'm going upstairs to catch a little sleep.\r\nWhen Fielding calls back, get me that cab and send up a pot of coffee.\r\nAnd it's been good meeting you, even if Fielding does say you are\r\nstraight as a die.\"\r\n\r\nSouza did not get the joke, but he knew that Hall was trying to joke and\r\nhe laughed.\r\n\r\nHall went to his room, took off his shoes and his suit, and fell across\r\nthe bed. He dozed off wondering why he had agreed so readily to meet the\r\nman with the tailor-made British diction.\r\n\r\nAt ten-fifteen his phone rang. \"Mr. Fielding called ten minutes ago. I\r\nhave your cab ready now. He is a very reliable driver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. How about my coffee?\"\r\n\r\nSouza laughed. \"The only waiter on duty is a _cabron_, Senor. Mr.\r\nFielding will have much better coffee for you, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nHall chuckled as he washed the sleep out of his eyes with cold water and\r\ncombed his hair. The waiter is a _cabron_! There was one for the book.\r\nHall made up a song while he dressed, a song about yes we have no coffee\r\ntoday because the son of a gun is a dirty _cabron_ so we have no coffee\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nSouza slammed his palm down on the bell twice when the elevator let Hall\r\ninto the lobby. \"Pepito!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe biggest cab driver Hall had ever seen outside of the United States\r\nbounded into the lobby from the blackness of the San Hermano night. He\r\nadvanced toward the desk in seven-league strides, wiping his right hand\r\non the blouse of his pale-blue slack suit and taking off his white\r\nchauffeur's cap with the other hand. He hovered over Hall like a mother\r\nhen.\r\n\r\n\"Pepito,\" Souza said, \"this is Senor Hall.\" This he said in Spanish. In\r\nEnglish, he again told Hall that the man was a very reliable driver.\r\n\r\n\"_Con mucho gusto_, Senor 'All. _Me llamo_ Delgado.\" Sheepishly, the\r\ngiant offered his hand to Hall.\r\n\r\n\"I am much pleased,\" Hall said. \"Shall we start now?\"\r\n\r\nPepito Delgado led Hall to a blue 1935 LaSalle parked in front of the\r\nBolivar. \"She is my own machine after I make the last payment next\r\nmonth,\" Delgado said. \"I am glad you speak Spanish. It is the only\r\nlanguage I know.\" He drove Hall to the ten-story Comercio building in a\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen Hall tried to pay him, Delgado shook his head happily. \"You'll pay\r\nme later,\" he smiled. \"I'll wait for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may be hours,\" Hall protested.\r\n\r\nDelgado called upon the Saints in a series of genially blasphemous\r\nexhortations. \"Mother of God,\" he said, \"it is bad luck not to make a\r\nround trip with the first American of the season. I'll wait and not\r\ncharge you more than two pesos for the whole trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to rob you,\" Hall said. \"Wait, and we shall make a fair\r\nprice later.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered the Comercio building, but as the doors of the elevator\r\nclosed and he started on his way up to the seventh floor Hall knew that\r\nDelgado was only playing the fool and was in fact no man's fool at all,\r\nand it bothered him. The right side of his face twitched slightly as he\r\nleft the car and walked down to the bend in the hall leading to Room\r\n719.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter three_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frosted glass door of Room 719 bore the words, \"Roger Fielding Y\r\nCia.\" The anteroom was dark, but Hall could see the dim form of a man\r\nsitting in a lighted inner room. He knocked on the glass without trying\r\nthe knob. In a moment, the light snapped on in the anteroom, and the man\r\nfrom the inner office opened the hall door.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall?\" he asked. \"I'm Roger Fielding. Welcome to San Hermano. And\r\nplease come inside.\"\r\n\r\nFielding fitted to the last detail the mental image Hall had conjured of\r\nthe man on the phone. Genial, peppery, he not only talked like a\r\nHollywood Englishman, he was a casting director's dream. Let the call go\r\nout for a man to play a retired India colonel, a British Ambassador, the\r\nDuke of Gretna Green, the popular professor of Chaldean Culture at\r\nOxford, the Dean of Canterbury or the Chief of Scotland Yard, and\r\nFielding was the man who could slip into the role without even changing\r\nfrom street clothes to costume. Fielding was the man, complete to the\r\nfaintly grizzled face with the gaunt features, the dazzling plaid\r\njacket, the thick-walled Dunhill pipe with the well-caked bowl.\r\n\r\nHe ushered Hall into the inner office, whose shades were all drawn to\r\nthe sills. There was a large mahogany desk at the window; against the\r\nwall stood a long table bearing a row of glass coffee makers, a tray of\r\ndemi-tasse cups, and a series of earthen canisters. On the wall above\r\nthis table hung a large sepia-tinted photograph of London, taken about\r\n1920. It faced a large print of a cottage and a brook in the Shakespeare\r\ncountry. This engraving hung over a row of four filing cabinets with\r\nsteel locks. The walls were further decorated with framed certificates\r\nof Fielding's membership in coffee associations of San Hermano, Rio and\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" Fielding urged, pulling a comfortable leather\r\nchair to the side of his desk for Hall, and taking the swivel chair\r\nbehind the desk for himself. The highly polished desk was bare, except\r\nfor a calendar pad and a folded red-leather picture frame whose picture\r\nfaced Fielding.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in coffee, you see.\"\r\n\r\nHall glanced up at the certificates and the long table. \"I see,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"How was your trip? Not too tiring, I hope? That's the sad thing about\r\nplanes. Faster than ships, but rather confining.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not too bad,\" Hall said. \"Besides, I stole an hour's cat nap at\r\nthe hotel while waiting for you to get to town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you,\" Fielding said. \"I like a man who can steal an hour's\r\nsleep when the spirit so moves him. May I make you some coffee to keep\r\nyou awake, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's not too much trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman was already at his coffee table. He took the pipe out of\r\nhis mouth, pointed with the end of the curved stem at one of the\r\ncanisters. \"I guess we'll mix you a little of that Monte Azul with some\r\nof this light roast from the south,\" he said. \"If that doesn't sit well,\r\nI have two dozen other roasts you can try.\"\r\n\r\nHall asked him how good a blend would result from the mixture of Monte\r\nAzul, Bogota, and the various Brazilian growths Androtten had described\r\nto the Brazilian on the plane.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" Fielding smiled, \"so you know coffees, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. My education started on the plane.\" Hall described\r\nAndrotten, and told Fielding of the Dutchman's experiences in Java and\r\nhis theories of the perfect blend.\r\n\r\nFielding set some coffee and water into one of the vacuum makers, put a\r\nmatch to the alcohol burner. \"Androtten,\" he mumbled. \"I don't remember\r\nmeeting him before. However, if it's the Monte Azul bean he's after,\r\nI'll venture he'll be in to see us before the week is over. Let me see,\r\nAndrotten ...\" He picked up his phone, asked for a local number.\r\n\"Hello,\" he said into the phone. \"Sorry to call so late, old man. About\r\na chap named Androtten. A Hollander. Blitzed out of Java by the Nippos.\r\nOf course. In coffee. Came in tonight on the Clipper to buy Monte Azul\r\nfor blending. Know him? I see. Well, thanks, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman put the phone away. \"One of my countrymen,\" he explained.\r\n\"He's not in Monte Azul and I'm not in southern crops. We help one\r\nanother in a case like this. Incidentally, he never heard of your\r\nAndrotten.\" He chatted aimlessly about the coffee business until the\r\ncoffee in the vacuum maker was ready, then he poured it into a small jug\r\nand brought the jug and two demi-tasse cups to the desk. \"Sugar?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nHall had lost his taste for sugar in San Sebastian. \"I have it black and\r\npure,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That's the only way to enjoy real coffee, Mr. Hall.\" Fielding took a\r\nkey from his pocket and went to the first filing cabinet. \"However,\" he\r\nsaid, \"it wasn't to talk about coffee that you were generous enough to\r\ncome here tonight. Not to talk about coffee.\" He pulled a brown-paper\r\nportfolio out of the file and returned with it to the desk. He undid the\r\nstrings that bound the portfolio, removed a manila folder.\r\n\r\n\"I think you had better pull your chair around and sit next to me here,\"\r\nFielding said. \"We have to look over some things in this file.\"\r\n\r\nHall moved both the chair and the jug of hot coffee. From his new\r\nposition, he could see that the leather folding frame on the desk\r\ncontained two photos of what was evidently one person. One photo showed\r\na young man of twenty-odd standing near a stone wall in what was\r\nundoubtedly England; the other photo was the young man as a laughing\r\nchild in a pony cart.\r\n\r\n\"I lost my boy,\" Fielding mumbled, absently. He tapped the ashes from\r\nhis pipe out into an ash tray on the window sill, filled it again with\r\nnew tobacco from a worn ostrich pouch. Hall could see a thin, rheumy\r\nfilm cover the Englishman's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The war?\" Hall asked, softly, but if Fielding heard him he gave no\r\nindication that he had.\r\n\r\nFielding held a lighted match over the filled bowl of his pipe, started\r\nit burning with deep, sucking draughts. \"Ah, your book,\" he said, when\r\nthe pipe was burning. \"You are a man of courage, Hall. You showed real\r\nguts. The kind of guts our Nellie Chamberlain didn't have when England\r\nneeded them most.\"\r\n\r\nHall poured fresh coffee into both his and Fielding's cups. \"Thank you,\"\r\nhe said. \"I tried to do it justice.\" He told him what the British censor\r\nin Cairo had said when he saw the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe grizzled Englishman took the pipe out of his mouth, looked at Hall\r\nwith amazement and disgust. \"British grit, my foot!\" He bellowed. \"The\r\n_Revenger_ was doomed the day Nellie Chamberlain decided to back Franco.\r\nI'm talking about your other book, Hall, _Behind Franco's Lines_.\r\nAny fool can get a battleship shot out from under him, but it takes a\r\nman ...\" Suddenly he stopped, because both Hall and he were looking at\r\nthe photos of the young man who was once a laughing boy in a\r\ncanary-colored pony cart.\r\n\r\nHe opened the folder. A photostat of a multi-paged typewritten report\r\nlay on top of the neat pile of papers in the folder. \"Now then, Hall, to\r\nget to the point. When I read that you had arrived in San Hermano, well,\r\nfrankly, Hall, I thought it was the answer to my prayers. I know I'm a\r\ngarrulous old man, but that comes from talking into the prevailing winds\r\nfor so long that I just can't help myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Hall said. \"Only I never thought of it in that\r\nway. I thought of it in terms of talking to a blank wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it as it may, Hall, I don't think I'll be talking at a blank wall\r\nwhen I speak to you. As I said, there is a point to this meeting, and\r\nthe point is brief. Hall, the Falange is in San Hermano, and it is up to\r\nmuch trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Falange!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know what you are thinking. Tabio made it illegal and it had to\r\ndisband and all that. But Tabio's government never threw the whole\r\nFalange crowd into jail, where they belong, and they are still getting\r\ntheir orders from the Spanish Embassy.\"\r\n\r\nHall passed a hand in front of his smarting eyes. \"Did you say they're\r\nup to trouble?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I said just that, Hall. Did you ever hear of the Cross and the Sword?\r\nSounds like the name of a ha'penny thriller. Have you seen one of these\r\nsince you arrived in San Hermano?\" He handed Hall a gold lapel emblem;\r\nit was a sword with a blazing hilt, the letters ATN engraved across the\r\ncross piece of the hilt.\r\n\r\n\"The ATN stands for Accion Tradicionalista Nacional, but no one calls\r\nthem that any more than they call the Nazis by their formal name. You\r\nknow, National German Socialist something or other. It's a bad business,\r\nHall, a very bad business. The Cross and Sword, alias the Falange\r\nEspanola.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they very strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't parade around the streets in their blue shirts as they did\r\nuntil Tabio clamped down in '40, and they don't pack the Cathedral in\r\ntheir Falange uniforms any more to hold special masses for the rotten\r\nsoul of that young snot old Primo de Rivera whelped. The Cross and the\r\nSword is not like that. But go to the San Hermano Country Club or a\r\nmeeting of the Lonja de Comercio or to a fashionable party in the\r\ncountry and every tailored jacket you see will have a Cross and a Sword\r\npinned to the lapel.\r\n\r\n\"Go to a little country village the day after the local school teacher\r\nwas murdered on some lonely dark road. The _campesinos_ stand around\r\nmuttering 'The Cross and the Sword is guilty,' and the next night the\r\nhome of some local Spanish landowner goes up in smoke. Then it's only a\r\nmatter of hours before the Cross and Sword members in San Hermano are\r\nraising hell because a fellow Cross and Sword member had his house\r\nburned down. They tell everyone that's what happens when you have a Red\r\nregime which forces a gentleman to sell his land to the government and\r\nthen sells the land back to the peasants who have to borrow the money\r\nfrom the government to pay for the land.\"\r\n\r\nHall turned the Cross and Sword emblem over in his fingers. \"That's what\r\nhappened in Spain,\" he said. \"It happened in just that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it did, Hall. Of course it did. Now look here. Look at this.\"\r\nFrom the bottom of the pile of documents in the folder, Fielding\r\nextracted a map of the nation's coastline.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, \"is the coast. Now note these islands. I have numbered\r\nsome of them in red ink. Now take this island, Number Three. Looks like\r\nan ink blot, doesn't it, now? Not much of a place for anything. Just a\r\nbunch of volcanic caves and some quite useless land. Good for grazing a\r\nfew head of sheep, but not too good even for that. Belongs to a chap\r\nnamed Segundo Vardenio. Been in his family for years, over three hundred\r\nyears. Own the island, own thousands of acres on the shore facing the\r\nbloody island. I know the whole family. More Spanish than the Duke of\r\nAlba, that family.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, they were all in the Falange. Segundo Vardenio was one of\r\nthe big leaders of the Falange in the country. Used to wear his blue\r\nshirt and his boots and give his damned stiff-arm salute all over the\r\nplace. And what do you think goes on at his island, Hall? I'll tell you.\r\nOil and submarines, submarines and oil. The Vardenio lands on the shore\r\nare in sugar. They have a narrow-gauge Diesel railway of their own on\r\nthe estates. Understand, Hall, a _Diesel railway_? The locomotives and\r\nthe submarines burn the same type of oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"German subs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hun subs and only Hun subs, Hall. Look here. Look at this report. I\r\nsent it to the chief of Naval Intelligence at our Embassy. On the 29th\r\nof September, 1940, a Hun sub anchored off Vardenio's island. A small\r\nlaunch belonging to the Vardenio family towed the sub into the largest\r\nof the sea caves on the island. The sub took on a load of Diesel oil,\r\nfresh fruit, meat, cigars, razor blades and a sealed portfolio. I don't\r\nknow what was in that portfolio. Three days later, the British freighter\r\n_Mandalay_, carrying beef and copper from San Hermano, was torpedoed and\r\nsunk by a Nazi submarine at approximately this point.\" Fielding held a\r\nruler between an X mark in the ocean and the island.\r\n\r\nHe continued to read the report aloud, running a bony finger under the\r\nwords as he read them, pausing now and then to sneer at his detractors\r\nin the British Embassy or to chuckle at some particular sarcasm written\r\ninto the report.\r\n\r\nThe facts in the report were set forth in great detail. They dealt with\r\nother submarine anchorages, with the role of the Cross and the Sword on\r\nthe waterfront, and with the beginnings of an organized ring of\r\nsabotage. The report ended with the account of the events which followed\r\nthe visit of the _Ciudad de Sevilla_, a Spanish liner, to the port of\r\nSan Hermano.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Hall,\" Fielding said. \"Listen to this. On the twentieth of\r\nSeptember, '41, the _Ciudad de Sevilla_ docked in San Hermano at\r\nfour-ten in the afternoon. At approximately five o'clock, the radio\r\noperator of the Spanish liner, one Eduardo Jimenez, left the ship and\r\nproceeded to a bar on the Paseo de Flores, the bar known as La\r\nPerrichola. There he met with two unidentified men, one of whom was\r\nlater identified as a provincial leader of the Cross and the Sword. The\r\nthree men went to a brothel near the waterfront, and at exactly ten\r\no'clock left the brothel and got into a waiting sedan which, by a\r\nroundabout route, took them to Calle Galleano 4857, a quiet villa in the\r\nwest suburb.\r\n\r\n\"The villa belongs to Jorge Davila, a lawyer for some of the great\r\nlandowning families of the south. Davila's record as one of the leaders\r\nof the now illegal Falange and an organizer of the Cross and the Sword\r\nhas been covered in my previous report, dated July 7th of this year.\"\r\nFielding poured some fresh coffee for Hall and himself. \"Tomorrow or the\r\nnext day I can show you the report in question, Hall. But to proceed\r\nwith this report.\r\n\r\n\"At Davila's home, a group of Cross and Sword leaders were waiting for\r\nthe three men in the sedan. They had a long meeting, lasting over five\r\nhours. Then eight men, including the Spanish ship's officer, left the\r\nhouse and entered two fast cars of American make. The cars proceeded to\r\nthe town of Alcala, in the sugar lands some seventy miles from San\r\nHermano.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning, there was no trace of the eight men in Alcala. That\r\nnight, the sugar fields of the English planter, Basil Greenleaf, were\r\nset on fire by incendiary flames started in over twenty different parts\r\nof his acreage at the same time. Two of Greenleaf's employees who were\r\nattempting to fight the blaze in the east field were killed by rifle\r\nfire. One of them lived long enough to stagger to the road where he told\r\nhis story to the Greenleaf foreman, a man named Esteban Anesi.\r\n\r\n\"I must call your attention, sir, to the fact that Greenleaf was the\r\nonly planter in the Alcala region who had contracted to sell his crop to\r\nGreat Britain, and that the fire took place exactly two weeks before the\r\nharvest time.\r\n\r\n\"Eduardo Jimenez was next seen in San Hermano the day after the fire,\r\nwhen he appeared in the Municipal Police Headquarters in what was\r\nevidently a state of extreme intoxication. He complained that on leaving\r\nhis ship on the twentieth, he had gone to a bar for a drink, met up with\r\ntwo pimps, and had then been taken to a brothel where, after two days of\r\ndrunken revelry, he had been cleaned out of his life's savings and then\r\nbeen carried out to sleep it off in an alley off the Calle Mercedes.\r\nHaving made his complaint, he passed out. A police doctor examined him,\r\nrecommended a good night's sleep.\"\r\n\r\nFielding held his finger under the word _sleep_. \"Hah,\" he roared. \"Damn\r\nclever, the bastards! Now then, where was my place? Oh, yes, good\r\nnight's sleep. Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning, Jimenez awoke, vomited, and started to yell for the\r\njailer. He wanted to know what he was doing in a cell, and when shown\r\nhis complaint, he expressed innocent amazement. He could not recall a\r\nthing. The warden gave him a hearty breakfast and sent him on his way.\r\nJimenez joined his ship, which sailed for Spain that afternoon with a\r\ncargo of beef.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of Eduardo Jimenez was the last in the report. Fielding put the\r\ncopy aside and leaned back in his chair. \"Was this worth your while,\r\nHall?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHall grinned. \"You have the necessary proof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. To the last word, old man. To the last word.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I have a copy of your report?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. I hope you will get better results, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask an impertinent question, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be as impertinent as you wish. I'm sixty-four years old, Hall, and if I\r\ncan't put up with Yank impertinence in this late stage, I deserve no\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, and don't answer if you think me too brash, Fielding, it's\r\nsimply ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" Fielding held up a restraining hand. \"Let me write your\r\nquestion out on this slip of paper and after you ask it, I'll show you\r\nwhat I've written.\" He scribbled a few words on the paper, covered them\r\nwith his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"Are you British Intelligence?\" Hall asked him.\r\n\r\nFielding handed Hall the slip of paper. On it was written: _Q. Fielding,\r\nold man, are you a British agent? A. No, my fine impertinent friend.\r\nBelieve it or not, I am not a British agent._\r\n\r\nHe was not smiling when he put a lighted match to the slip of paper and\r\nwatched it burn to ashes in the bronze tray. \"As a matter of fact,\" he\r\nsaid, soberly, \"I am not in very good repute at the British Embassy. I\r\norganized a dinner of the more sensible people in the British colony\r\nhere in '38 and, after I'd made a blistering speech against Munich and\r\nnon-intervention in Spain we all signed a row of a cable to Nellie\r\nChamberlain. They have me down as a sort of an eccentric and a Red.\r\nPerhaps I am eccentric, but I'm no more a Red than poor Professor Tabio\r\nor your own Mr. Roosevelt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been called both things before myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you have, Hall. I'll bet you have. Let's have another jug of\r\ncoffee and look through some more reports. Can you stay awake for an\r\nhour or so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can stay up all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe you can. But I'm not as young as I used to be. We'll finish\r\nthe reports in this folder and call it a night. But first--the coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThe aroma from the jug warmed Hall's senses. In the cell at San\r\nSebastian he would awake at night dreaming that he was smelling the\r\nsweet vapors of a fresh pot of coffee boiling away near his pallet.\r\n\"God,\" he said, \"I must tell you about what this smell means to me some\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing like it,\" Fielding agreed. \"Now let me see, here's a\r\nphotostat of a letter from the Embassy acknowledging the receipt of the\r\nreport I just read, and here ... Ah....\" He started to turn the next\r\nletter over, but Hall, reading the letter-head, laid a hand on the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\n\"May I?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nFielding handed him the letter. It was on the stationery of the\r\nInternational Brigade Association in London, dated January, 1938.\r\n\r\n\"The action on the Jarama front ... bitter ... your son Sergeant Harold\r\nFielding leading squad of volunteer sappers ... missing in action ...\r\nthorough check on records of hospitals and field stations on that\r\nfront ... no record of Sergeant Fielding ... we therefore regret ... must\r\nbe presumed dead....\"\r\n\r\nThe father of Sergeant Fielding held the picture of the boy in front of\r\nHall. \"This photograph,\" he said, heavily. \"It was taken a year before\r\nhe went to Spain. You didn't, by any chance, happen to know the lad, did\r\nyou, Hall? He was my only child. Completing work on his Master's in\r\nbiochemistry at Cambridge when the Spanish show started. You didn't\r\nhappen to know him, eh, Hall?\"\r\n\r\nHall studied the photograph.\r\n\r\n\"He fought with the British Battalion,\" Fielding offered.\r\n\r\n\"I was with them in the fighting for Sierra Pedigrosa,\" Hall said.\r\n\"There was Pete Kerrigan, and a boy named Patterson I knew pretty well.\r\nAnd--but that was after the Jarama fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy is not alive,\" Fielding said. \"I checked with the International\r\nRed Cross after the war, and he was not taken prisoner by the fascists.\r\nI just wanted to find someone who could tell me--who could tell me how\r\nmy boy died.\"\r\n\r\nHall returned the red-leather frame. \"I wish from the bottom of my heart\r\nI could help you. But I just can't. I'm afraid I never did meet the\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nRoger Fielding read the letter from London for perhaps the thousandth\r\ntime, sighed, and placed it face down on top of the pile to the left of\r\nthe letters and reports in the folder. \"Ah, well,\" he said. \"Now for the\r\nliving. Now here's a report I made three weeks ago. Some day those young\r\nstuffed shirts in the Embassy will have to read my reports seriously,\r\nHall. Perhaps this is the report that will do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe second report bore the heading: \"Neutrality or Belligerence:\r\nGamburdo or Tabio.\"\r\n\r\nHall started. \"What's this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Let's look it over, old man.\" Fielding cleared his throat and began to\r\nread aloud.\r\n\r\n\"It is no secret, or it should be no secret to our vigilant intelligence\r\nservices, that President Anibal Tabio is a warm friend of the cause for\r\nwhich the United Nations are fighting. It is no secret that Tabio,\r\nbefore being stricken with his present tragic illness, was planning to\r\ngo before the Havana Conference himself to lead the continental campaign\r\nto declare war on the Axis powers.\r\n\r\n\"However, the views of Vice-President Gamburdo, who now has assumed the\r\ncontrol of the government, are less well known. Gamburdo's views,\r\nhowever, are not among the best kept secrets of this war.\" Fielding\r\nchuckled, waved his pipe in the direction of the Presidencia, and added\r\nthe comment, \"I should say not! They are far from secret.\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo's ties to the Cross and the Sword are very discreet. I have\r\nreason to believe that Gamburdo believes his link with the ATN is not\r\nknown by anyone except a few chosen fascist leaders.\"\r\n\r\nFielding looked up at Hall. \"Oho,\" he laughed. \"That must have been hard\r\nto swallow. They don't like to call the Cross-and-Sword bandits\r\n'fascists.' Oh, no. Not the Embassy. They've got them tabbed as\r\n'conservatives' opposed to the extremes of the Red Tabio regime. The\r\nfools!\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, to continue. Ah--chosen fascist leaders. Oh, yes. But twice\r\nwithin the past two weeks, for three hours on the twelfth and for a full\r\nday on the fourteenth, Gamburdo was at the ranch of his brother Salvador\r\nin Bocas del Sur conferring with Cross and Sword leaders Jorge Davila,\r\nSegundo Vardenio, Carlos Antonio Montes, and Jose Ignacio del Llano. The\r\nsecond meeting was also attended by Ramos, the Spanish Consul General in\r\nSan Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ramos,\" Hall commented. \"I know something about him. Two years ago\r\nBatista gave him twelve hours to get the hell out of Cuba before the\r\ndiplomatic courtesies were forgotten and a cot reserved for Ramos in the\r\nconcentration camp for Axis nationals on the Isle of Pines.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did come to San Hermano from Havana,\" Fielding said. \"So I'm not so\r\ncrazy after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not crazy at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" Fielding exclaimed. \"If you know that Ramos was kicked out,\r\nthen the Embassy crowd must know it too. Now I begin to see why\r\nCommander New has invited me to have dinner at the Embassy tomorrow.\" He\r\ntook a deep breath, straightened his tie with elaborate mock ceremony.\r\n\"Mr. Hall,\" he said, speaking like an announcer at a royal court, \"I\r\nhave the pleasure of informing you that Roger Fielding, Esquire, is\r\nabout to be released from the insane asylum to which His Majesty's\r\nAmbassador consigned him in September, 1938.\"\r\n\r\nHall laughed and helped himself to another pipeful of Fielding's\r\ntobacco. \"Let's finish this report,\" he said. \"I can't tell you how\r\nimportant it is to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, old man.\" Fielding handed the report to Hall. \"I was\r\nreading them aloud to keep you from falling asleep. But I think you're\r\nwide awake now.\"\r\n\r\nHall smiled warmly at the old man and read the rest of the report. It\r\nwas very brief. It described how Gamburdo had shifted nearly the entire\r\ncustoms staff at San Hermano to other ports or to desk jobs on land, and\r\nreplaced them with new customs men who were in many cases proven members\r\nof the Falange or the ATN or both. This move, the report stated, opened\r\nthe gates to Axis arsonists assigned to cross the seas on Spanish\r\nliners.\r\n\r\n\"Cross and Sword members,\" the report concluded, \"are in certain\r\nexclusive bars openly boasting that when Tabio passes away, Gamburdo\r\nwill declare the nation a neutral in this war. His family has been\r\nsending copper, hides, beef, coffee, and sugar only to Spanish firms\r\nsince 1940. It is an open secret in the Lonja de Comercio that these\r\nshipments do not remain in Spain but are immediately trans-shipped to\r\nGermany. None of the Spanish firms with which the Gamburdo family does\r\nbusiness were in existence before July 18, 1936, the day the Spanish War\r\nstarted. They are all known in shipping and export circles as German\r\nenterprises. Gamburdo's brother has twice been heard to boast, while in\r\nhis cups, that the Nazis are protecting his vast holdings in France.\r\n\r\n\"The Cross and Sword members in San Hermano business circles speak\r\nhighly of Gamburdo and to a man they assert that if Tabio dies, Gamburdo\r\nwill impose a foreign policy which in the name of neutrality will bring\r\nprosperity to the landowners and exporters. It will also, of course,\r\nbring vitally needed war supplies from this country to the Axis powers;\r\na fact they don't even bother to deny.\"\r\n\r\nHall was puzzled by the report's lack of information on Gamburdo's link\r\nto the Falange during the Spanish War. He remembered that picture of\r\nGamburdo at the Falange dinner held in San Hermano in 1936, the picture\r\nhe had seen in the files of the secret police in Havana. \"How much do\r\nyou have on Gamburdo?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo?\" Fielding yawned twice, stretched his arms. \"Not as much as I\r\nwould like to have, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" Hall told him about the picture.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not surprised,\" Fielding said. \"But it's really news to me. What do\r\nyou know that I should know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much, I'm afraid. How about this doctor who arrived on my\r\nplane, Varela Ansaldo?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's never been in San Hermano before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who sent for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. _El Imparcial_ has been giving Gamburdo the credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Hall. I think they might be trying to give Gamburdo\r\ncredit for something he doesn't deserve. _El Imparcial_ is very much\r\npro-Gamburdo, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know it! I used to see Fernandez in his Falange uniform in San\r\nSebastian.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think his paper can be right about Ansaldo? I mean about his\r\nbeing brought to San Hermano by Gamburdo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly I can find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Fielding? What's your hunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none, old man. But I can see that you have, and I can see what\r\nit is. You think _El Imparcial_ might for once be telling the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the whole truth. I saw _El Imparcial_, too. It also said that\r\nVarela Ansaldo was brought to San Hermano to _cure_ Tabio.\"\r\n\r\nFielding cocked his head, looked at Hall out of one eye. \"And you think\r\nAnsaldo was brought in to kill Professor Tabio?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I just don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you mean to find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Quien sabe?_\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help you. I'll give you all the help I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you think I'm nuts?\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman hesitated for a long while. \"Ah ... Frankly, old\r\nman--well, damn it all, you could be wrong. But I'd never say you\r\nwere--_nuts_ I believe is the word you used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it's been a busy day.\" Fielding put the letters back in the\r\nfolder, then shoved the folder into the portfolio and tied the strings.\r\n\"Unless I hear a motion to the contrary, I shall make a move to adjourn.\r\nAh, the delegate from North America bows. The Ayes have it. Session is\r\nadjourned.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from the desk, put the portfolio back in the filing cabinet,\r\nclosed the drawer and tested the lock. \"Suppose we meet again after I\r\nhave my dinner with Commander New at the Embassy tomorrow night. He's\r\nour new Intelligence man. Understand he took quite a beating from the\r\nHun at Dunkirk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swell. Same place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet, old man. Suppose I give you a ring.\" The Englishman\r\nsuddenly lapsed into a lisping, Castillian Spanish. \"Senor Hall? Eh,\r\nSenor Hall? This is Father Arupe. Bless you, my son. Would you care to\r\ncome to confession tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it will be Father Arupe on the phone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Senor. If I ask you to confession, it means this office in an\r\nhour. If I suggest you attend mass in the morning, drive out to my\r\nhouse. I'll write the address for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just another word about tonight's reports. If you could help me\r\nbring the facts about the waterfront to your government, I think it\r\nwould be most beneficial. Most beneficial, old man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I can count on you. Knew it before I ever laid eyes on you,\r\nHall. One of my associates can keep us both posted on the waterfront.\r\nName's Harrington. Grand chap, Harrington. Straight as a die, and\r\nintelligent.\"\r\n\r\nHall poured a cup full of cold coffee and swallowed it in a gulp. \"God,\r\nthat's good coffee,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going back to the Bolivar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a car waiting downstairs. The driver insisted upon waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"El Gran Pepe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. I guess it is Big Joe.\" He described his driver. \"And Souza says\r\nhe is very reliable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is, old man. He is. You know, since they turned the bloody\r\nlights down, it's worth your life to cross the streets at night. Awful\r\nlot of traffic accidents and all that, you know. Nothing like a reliable\r\ndriver.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about you, Fielding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll phone for my own reliable driver. Or better yet, tell Pepe to\r\ncome back for me, will you, old man?\"\r\n\r\nHall rubbed the right side of his face. \"Why don't you ride back with\r\nme, and then continue on out to your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It would be better if you left here alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no danger, old man. No danger. Besides ...\" Fielding reached\r\ninto his jacket pocket, took out a small black automatic. \"She's loaded,\r\nand I can shoot in the dark, if need be. My Betsy is all I need.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is silly,\" Hall protested.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, now, old man. No one is going to break in to the office at this\r\nhour of the night. I'm in no danger at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you say so.\" Hall got up. \"Don't see me to the door. I know my way.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man put his arm around Hall's shoulder. \"We English,\" he said,\r\n\"we're an undemonstrative tribe. Take pride in our cold hearts. But\r\nunderneath the ice some of us have hearts. I'm glad to know you, Hall.\r\nAnd I'm glad we had this little chat. Good night, and sleep well. You're\r\nall in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Fielding. And thanks. You're swell.\"\r\n\r\nHall left the office, rode the elevator to the main floor. Outside, the\r\nreliable driver was asleep at the wheel, his right hand under the white\r\nchauffeur's cap which rested on his lap. Hall stood near the open\r\nwindow, smiling sardonically at Big Pepe. O.K., pal, he thought, we'll\r\nfind out about you right now. He cleared his throat, suddenly barked,\r\n\"Arriba Espana!\"\r\n\r\nBig Pepe awoke with a startled growl. The hand under the cap swung up\r\ntoward the window. It was clenched around a large nickeled revolver.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, Pepe,\" Hall laughed. \"Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThe driver groaned, shoved the pistol into his trouser-pocket. Then he\r\nalso laughed. \"Get in,\" he said. \"Get in and thank your stars you're\r\nstill alive.\"\r\n\r\nHall joined him in the front seat.\r\n\r\n\"Arriba Espana,\" Pepe muttered, starting the car. \"That is no joke in\r\nthe heart of any Delgado from the Asturias. That is an abomination.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're an Asturiano?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at me, _companero_. Do I have the face of a Gallego? Do I have the\r\nhead of a Catalan? Do I have the eyes of a Madrileno or the soul of a\r\n_puta_?\"\r\n\r\n\"You fought in the war against the fascists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother of God, he's asking me if I fought! Always until eternity they\r\nwill ask, Delgado, did you fight? And what will I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch out!\" Hall screamed. \"You'll hit that pole!\" He grabbed for the\r\nwheel. Big Pepe's steel arm stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"_De nada_,\" the driver laughed. \"Didn't Fernando tell you I am a\r\nreliable driver?\" The car missed the pole by inches, whirled around a\r\ncorner on two wheels, and then rolled casually down the Avenida de la\r\nLiberacion. Another mad turn, and they were at the Bolivar.\r\n\r\n\"The Englishman, Fielding,\" Hall said. \"He wants you to pick him up at\r\nthe office and take him home.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bueno._\" Big Pepe put the car in gear.\r\n\r\n\"How much do I owe you?\" Hall shouted.\r\n\r\n\"_Manana, companero, manana._\" Big Pepe had to stick his head out of the\r\nwindow and look back, while the car moved ahead, to answer Hall. One\r\nmore _manana_, the American thought, and the reliable driver would drive\r\nhis car through a wall. He watched the car turn the corner on two\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nSouza was still on duty. He handed Hall the key to his room. \"You look\r\nvery tired, Senor Hall,\" he said. \"I hope you sleep well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Good night, _amigo_.\" When he got to his room, he phoned\r\ndown to the desk.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot,\" he said. \"But if that _cabron_ of a waiter is still on duty,\r\ncould you send up a bottle of mineral water with the elevator operator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. The operator is no _cabron_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. And by the way, didn't I meet you the last time I was in San\r\nHermano?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Senor. But if you will pardon me for presuming, I feel in a sense\r\nas if we are old friends, in a sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Senor. You see, I have read your book.\"\r\n\r\n\"My book?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Si, su libro. Buenas noches, companero._\"\r\n\r\nThis time there was no confusion in Hall's mind. He knew which book\r\nFernando Souza meant. He went to sleep feeling less lonely than he had\r\nin a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter four_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alarm in the pigskin traveling clock Bird had given Hall as a\r\ngoing-away gift went on at eight. Hall shut it off, glanced at the\r\nradium dial, and got out of bed. On the roof tops of the houses in old\r\nSan Hermano roosters were crowing. Outside, trolley bells clanged a\r\nblock away from the Bolivar. Hall took the half-emptied bottle of\r\ncarbonated water into the bathroom, poured it over his toothbrush,\r\nsprinkled the wet brush with powder, and scrubbed his teeth. The charged\r\nwater filled his mouth with a vigorous foam. He rinsed his mouth with\r\nthe rest of the soda, bathed, shaved and dressed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in his box at the desk. He handed the day clerk the\r\nkey and walked out to the street. At a little hole-in-the-wall stand on\r\nVirtudes Street he bought a glass of mouth-puckering tamarind juice. A\r\nfew steps down the narrow street there was a newsstand. Hall bought two\r\nmorning papers, found a cafe where he had a cup of coffee with hot milk\r\nand a toasted roll. He remained at his table in the soft morning sun,\r\nreading the papers and smoking a cigar, until nearly ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nAccording to both papers, Ansaldo and Marina were to make a preliminary\r\nexamination of Tabio, and would then spend the rest of the day\r\nconsulting with San Hermano physicians who were attending the President.\r\nThere was no hint of what was actually wrong with the President, simply\r\na repetition of the old statement that Tabio's condition was still\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nJerry was on time for their breakfast appointment. She was wearing a\r\nbright yellow suit of very thin cloth. \"Hello,\" she said. \"Still want to\r\nbe a tourist guide?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than ever.\" He caught himself wishing that this could be just an\r\nordinary date with a girl.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're scowling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry. My mind must have wandered. I'd never scowl at you.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"I thought for a moment that I'd\r\npulled a boner. The suit isn't too loud, is it?\"\r\n\r\nIt was his turn to smile. \"God, no,\" he laughed. \"It's perfect. Very\r\nhungry? Good. We're eating right here in the hotel.\"\r\n\r\nThey took a table near a potted orange tree.\r\n\r\n\"How do you say ham and eggs in Spanish?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"_Jamon y huevos._ Want some?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh. But I want to order them myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K. Order some for me, too.\" Hall hissed for the waiter.\r\n\r\n\"What's the idea of razzing the guy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Relax, that's the way you call a waiter.\"\r\n\r\nJerry smiled at the waiter when he reached their table. With a childish\r\ndirectness, she pointed first at Hall and then to herself. \"_Jamon y\r\nhuevos_,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"That is all the Spanish the senorita speaks,\" Hall explained. \"I think\r\nwe will have toast and coffee, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" the waiter said in accented English. \"The lady speaks\r\ngood, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Jerry laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" the waiter said, \"today is very nice and sunny. Very\r\nnice.\" He walked into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"I have a perfect itinerary,\" Hall said. \"Old San Hermano first; that's\r\nthe historic colonial part of the city. Then, at noon, we take the\r\nfunicular railway to the top of the world for lunch. And after\r\nthat--well, well, well, as the waiter said.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked about San Hermano all morning. Hall showed her through the\r\nold fortress of the Duke of La Runa, which the government had restored\r\nafter Segura was overthrown, told her about the early colonial history\r\nof the city. They sat on the old sea wall for a few minutes, while Hall\r\npointed out the Moorish and Spanish details of the stone houses along\r\nthe sea drive above the wharves. The youngest of the houses was a\r\ncentury old; the tile friezes along their bellies had all been imported\r\nfrom Spain in sailing ships. Jerry watched the sun do magic tricks of\r\nblue and purple on the surface of the houses. They wandered through the\r\nold market places, deserted that day, but colored by the little stalls\r\nalong the sidewalks. Hall bought a large spray of gardenias for the girl\r\nfrom an itinerant vendor.\r\n\r\n\"Where are those beaten-silver things you told me about?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Later,\" he said. \"There's plenty of time for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do we go now?\" Jerry asked. \"My feet are killing me.\"\r\n\r\n\"From now on we ride.\" He found a taxi parked near the Cathedral, and\r\nthey rode to the funicular railway terminal at the base of Monte Azul.\r\nHe told her how the railway was built by Segura, as they rode. \"But it\r\nwas when the Tabio junta threw the Seguristas out that the damned cable\r\ncars meant anything to the people of the country themselves. You see,\r\nJerry, Segura gave the concession on top of the mountain to one of his\r\nthugs. The new regime opened it up to the little guys. And wait till you\r\nsee what they did to the grounds.\"\r\n\r\nThey shared the cable car with an old water colorist, and two other\r\nyoung couples. \"My God,\" Jerry exclaimed, when she saw the route the\r\ncars followed, \"it's like climbing hand over hand up a sheer cliff!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. In a way, though, I'm sorry this is\r\nsuch a clear day. On a cloudy day, the tracks just vanish into the soup\r\nup there, and you feel that you are being towed into the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nThe cars climbed for five miles, creaking, whining, grunting, but\r\nsteadily pushing on toward the peak. From the opened windows, Jerry\r\ncould see the Moorish villas at the base of the mountain, then their\r\nred-tiled roofs, then the miles of scraggly wild orange trees. The\r\nsweet, heavy odors of their blossoms filled the car.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look,\" she said, \"the town is getting smaller. And the sea is\r\ngrowing bluer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait until we get off,\" he smiled. \"Then you'll really see something.\"\r\n\r\nThe old artist took out a sketch pad, studied Jerry's excited face, and\r\nmade some quick strokes with a charcoal stick. Hall winked at the old\r\nman. \"_Hola, viejo. Que pasa?_\"\r\n\r\n\"_La mujer es muy bonita._\"\r\n\r\n\"_Muchas gracias_, Senor. _Es verdad._\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying to him?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"He said you are very beautiful and I said that's the Lord's gospel\r\ntruth. He's sketching you, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we buy it if it's good?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll speak to him later. Up there.\"\r\n\r\nThe car stopped at the terminal on the man-made plateau about a thousand\r\nfeet from the actual tip of Monte Azul. A wooden rail ran along the edge\r\nof the plateau for about a quarter of a mile. Within the rail was the\r\nfunicular terminal, a souvenir stand, a tiny post office, and a large\r\nopen-air restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"Let's eat,\" Hall said. \"You get hungry as a horse up there.\"\r\n\r\nThey took a table with an enameled orange top near the rail. Large\r\nbarbecue pits hugged the mountain side of the restaurant, and under a\r\nshed roof three cooks presided over a row of steaming pots. From their\r\ntable, they could see the mile-deep belt of mountain flowers which had\r\nbeen planted in the days of the dictators and expanded by the democrats.\r\nThere were flowers of every shape and color, but orange was the color\r\nwhich spoke most frequently in the cultivated beds. Below the flowers,\r\nthe mountainside seemed to be daubed with various shades of green and\r\nbrown. \"But usually,\" Hall said, \"the mountain is blue. Almost as blue\r\nas the sea.\"\r\n\r\nJerry looked down at the sea. \"I've never seen such a deep blue,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I know. This is the bluest water in the world.\" He hissed for a waiter.\r\n\"I'm going to order a hell of a meal, young lady. A side of barbecued\r\nbeef and some corn cakes the like of which you never tasted and--just\r\ntrust my judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we get drinks here?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a white wine that beats anything in France.\"\r\n\r\nThe food was good and the wine was potent. When they were done eating,\r\nJerry wanted more wine. \"No more wine,\" Hall smiled. \"Nibble on this\r\ncheese, and while you're nibbling I'm going to order a punch I've just\r\ncomposed in honor of this day. Let's call it Punch _Para Las Mujeres\r\nBonitas_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever that means,\" Jerry said, dreamily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's wonderful. Black rum and passion-flower juice and tamarinda\r\nand wild cherry juice and--just wait. I'll be right back.\" He walked\r\nacross the plateau to the outdoor bar and had a long discussion with the\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nJerry was staring into the sea when he returned. \"You know?\" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. I was just thinking that I've been looking at the sea and not\r\nthinking at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cigarette?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh. Thanks for taking me up here. It reminds me of something nice,\r\nbut I can't think of what.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Hall said. \"The minute you get here for the first time you\r\nfeel as if you've known this place all your life.\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter brought a pitcher of scarlet punch and two tall glasses to\r\nthe table. Hall paid the check, and added a package of American\r\ncigarettes to his tip.\r\n\r\nHe filled the two glasses, tried a sip from his before handing one glass\r\nto the girl. \"Let's see how this strikes you,\" he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"It's delicious!\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish it and then try walking,\" Hall said, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try walking later.\" They finished the punch in the pitcher, and\r\nthen Jerry looked at her face in a pocket mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Hall,\" she sighed. \"It ate away what was left of my lipstick\r\nand I think it gave me a red nose and I suppose I should powder and\r\npaint but I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"you are under the influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may be high, sir, but I'm not drunk.\"\r\n\r\nHall got up and took her arm. \"Shame on you, nurse,\" he said. \"There's\r\nstill a thousand sights to see up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead on,\" she commanded. \"We'll see who's potted.\"\r\n\r\nHall pointed to the edge of the restaurant. There was a mountain path at\r\nthat end, a graveled path leading into a park of streams and cypresses.\r\nThey followed this path until the forest closed in around them, and they\r\nwere alone.\r\n\r\n\"My feet,\" Jerry said. \"These shoes were not meant for serious mountain\r\nclimbing.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lady.\" Hall spread his brown gabardine jacket in the moss bank\r\nadjacent to a small stream. She took off her shoes and stretched out on\r\nthe jacket, her hands clasped under her head.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" she said, \"if I weren't so full of food I'd take my\r\nstockings off and dip my feet in the creek. I just haven't the strength\r\nto move.\"\r\n\r\nHall lit a cigarette, put it in the girl's mouth. \"If you ever dipped\r\none of your dainty gringo toes in this burbling frigidaire,\" he said,\r\n\"they'd hear your screams twelve miles out at sea.\"\r\n\r\nJerry sat up and hummed the tune of \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf.\"\r\nShe took off her stockings, started to edge down toward the stream.\r\n\"Here, help me up.\" She extended a hand to Hall, who pulled her to her\r\nfeet. \"I'm going wading.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no scream when Jerry stepped into the water. Her breath just\r\nstopped. She yanked her foot out of the stream as if it were a blazing\r\ninferno, hopped around on the dry foot with tears in her eyes, and then\r\nlay down on the jacket.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway,\" she said, when she could catch her breath, \"I didn't\r\nscream.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You were brave.\" He took out a large handkerchief, started to rub\r\nthe foot which had been in the water.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought I'd wind up here when I left New York,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"When do you go to work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow, I guess. The President is a pretty sick patient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Ansaldo think he can pull him through?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he find out what's the matter with Tabio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. That's what he's doing today.\"\r\n\r\nHall wanted to ask her further questions about Ansaldo, but he was\r\nafraid to betray his interest too openly. \"Let's cut it out,\" he\r\nlaughed. \"This is a party, and we're talking shop.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed in contentment. \"Oh, that's nice,\" she murmured. \"I\r\ndon't care what we talk about, as long as we stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now, I wish I could stay here forever.\" She had her hands clasped\r\nunder her head, was talking to the tips of the cypresses as well as to\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like Shangri-La,\" she said. \"We should both be two centuries old.\r\nHow old are you, Hall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-six.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm twenty-eight. Honest. Not twenty-one. Twenty-eight. In two years\r\nI'll be over the borderline. Then I'll be an old lady. But right now I'm\r\nnot going to lie about my age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now I don't think you could tell a lie. Not even a white lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fair, Hall. First you get me drunk--only I'm not high any more--then\r\nyou take me to Shangri-La. Can I call you Matthew? Or is it Matty or\r\nMatt the women in your life call you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends call me Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends! There's no Mrs. Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Never has been.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a husband, once. Only I divorced him and became a nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That when you left Ohio? Or was it Indiana?\"\r\n\r\nJerry turned her eyes from the cypresses and looked at Hall, who sat at\r\nher side, his face over hers. \"Ohio,\" she said. \"How did you know?\"\r\n\r\nHall bent over and kissed her lightly on the lips. She neither resisted\r\nnor returned his kiss. \"You sweet dope,\" he said. \"I'm a Buckeye myself.\r\nCleveland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm from Columbus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleased to know you, Miss Columbus. Did you know you have green eyes\r\nand there are little gold stars in each eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope. Sweet dope. No one ever told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He calls me names!\" Jerry sat up and put her arms around Hall's neck.\r\n\"He calls me names.\" She put her slightly opened mouth against his lips\r\nand pulled him closer, and together they sank to the ground. They lay\r\nlocked in the one kiss, the girl's full breasts pressing against Hall's\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n\"Don't,\" she whispered, \"please. Ah, don't. Ah, Matt. Darling.\"\r\n\r\nHe found her lips again. They were trembling, and he could feel the\r\ntremors which started in the pit of her stomach and rose to her\r\nshoulders. \"Please, Matt,\" she broke from his grip and turned her face\r\nto the ground. \"Darling,\" she said, biting then kissing his hand. He put\r\nhis arm around her and kissed the back of her neck. She shuddered\r\ndeliciously. \"Let's get up,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"We're alone here,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and kissed his hand. \"I'm getting up,\" she said. \"Let me sit\r\nup, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said. He sat up with her. She ran her hand lightly over his\r\nface, brushing the scars, the flatness of his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Gorilla,\" she said, and she kissed him softly on the mouth. \"You tore\r\noff one of my buttons, you ape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Miss Columbus,\" he said, speaking with a Spanish accent. \"It is\r\na very nice day today. Very sunny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Still want to stay here forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh. Do I look too messy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Your hair could stand some combing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you get me some more of that punch?\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had combed her hair, they stood up and he took her hand and\r\nthey walked back along the graveled path.\r\n\r\n\"Can we phone to town from here?\" she asked. \"Doctor wanted me to check\r\nin at about five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know yet.\"\r\n\r\nThey had their punch. The light danced in Jerry's hair, gave it the same\r\norange tint which dominated the flower beds. \"I forgot to tell you,\"\r\nHall said. \"You're beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nJerry swirled the scarlet drops on the bottom of her glass. \"You don't\r\nknow a thing about me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What should I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. But can I tell you, anyway? I want to, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nJerry sighed. \"I told you I was married before, didn't I? It didn't\r\ntake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be. I'm not really from Columbus. That is, my home town is nearer\r\nColumbus than to any other city, but it's just a hick village in the\r\nsticks.\" She told her story in very few words. High school, and then\r\nthree years at the State University, and then marriage to a small-town\r\nhigh-school principal some years older than herself. After five years of\r\nsmall-town married life, Jerry came into a small inheritance, left the\r\nschoolmaster, and went back to get her degree. \"I wanted to study\r\nmedicine,\" she said, \"but I didn't have enough money, so I took up\r\nnursing instead. The idea was to earn enough as a nurse to go back to\r\nmedical school.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"New York happened. I couldn't take hospital regimentation, and some of\r\nthe doctors were so anxious to sleep with me that they got me some snap\r\njobs. You know, sitting up with rich lushes and hanging onto the girdles\r\nof deserted dowagers who wanted to jump out of windows and handing the\r\nright scalpel to society surgeons while they carved out a million-dollar\r\ngut.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have paid well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you became a glamour girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pretty cruel way to put it, Matt. I'm not really a dope, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I just stopped thinking because I was afraid to think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does Ansaldo fit into the picture?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came with him because I admire his skill as a doctor. I can learn\r\nthings by working with him. He's fantastically good, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not long. He came to New York about six months ago to operate on a\r\ndrunk who'd been my patient for months. The patient had fallen down a\r\nflight of stairs on my day off. Ansaldo invited me to be one of the\r\nnurses when he operated on the patient's spine. Are you interested in\r\noperations?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was amazing. I thought I had seen some good surgeons at work. But\r\nAnsaldo is more than good, Matt. He's great. After that first operation,\r\nI was his nurse for all of his New York operations. And naturally, I\r\njumped at the chance to come along. I'm a perfectionist, Matt. Some day,\r\nsome day soon I hope, I'm going to go back to medical school. I've been\r\nsaving every spare penny I could. And what I'm learning from Ansaldo\r\ncouldn't be taught in any school.\"\r\n\r\n\"You amaze me,\" he said, honestly. It was hard to doubt her. He prodded\r\nher for details of Ansaldo's skill. She answered him earnestly, and with\r\nincreased enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"But wait,\" she protested, finally. \"I don't see why I should be telling\r\nall about myself. I haven't talked like this to any man for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't listened like this for just as long,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"But it's not good, I know,\" she said, her voice abruptly breaking.\r\nThere were tears in her eyes, and she turned away. \"I've gone and made a\r\nfool of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she said. \"You probably have a wife and nine kids in New York.\r\nI bet you carry their pictures in your wallet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I?\" Hall handed his wallet to Jerry. \"Look for yourself. Take out\r\nevery picture.\"\r\n\r\nThere were three photos in all. The first was of Bird, his wife and\r\ntheir baby. \"My publisher,\" he explained.\r\n\r\nThere was a sepia photo of Hall pointing the lens of a camera at a bomb\r\ncrater in Madrid. \"London?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"London.\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining photo showed Hall talking to an aged couple on a road\r\npacked with refugees. \"France?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\nHall shook his head. \"No. Belgium.\" Again he lied. The picture had been\r\ntaken in Spain.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurt me, Matt,\" the girl said. She was dry-eyed now, but\r\nsaddened. \"Don't hurt me later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't hurt you,\" he said. He wondered at that moment if he would be\r\nable to avoid hurting her.\r\n\r\n\"Are you really alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" He did not laugh. \"God! I'm the loneliest sonofabitch in the\r\nwhole world.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled again. \"I have half a mind to believe you,\" she said.\r\n\"Shall we get started back?\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K. It's getting late. Have dinner with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, yet. Would you call the hotel and ask if there are any\r\nmessages for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a phone in the souvenir stand.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl bought a batch of picture sets while Hall was on the phone. \"Do\r\nwe eat?\" she asked when he came out of the booth.\r\n\r\n\"No. They want you in the Marti Memorial Lab at the University at\r\nseven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I phoned for a driver to meet us at the bottom in twenty minutes. We\r\nstill have time for a drive around the nicer parts of New San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to the terminal to wait for their car. The ticket agent\r\nglanced at Jerry and then he reached under his counter and brought up a\r\nlarge envelope. \"Senor,\" he said, \"the painter left this for the lady.\"\r\nIt was the sketch of Jerry, wide-eyed and happy as the car climbed Monte\r\nAzul. In the lower right-hand corner was an inscription Hall translated\r\nfor her. \"To a charming visitor--a memento of her visit to our free\r\ncity. Horacio.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was sweet of the old man,\" Jerry said. \"Tell the guy to thank him\r\nfor me, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I already did. But this is fantastic. An original Horacio water color\r\nis worth a baby fortune. This sketch is valuable, Jerry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you recognize him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never saw him before in my life.\"\r\n\r\nBig Pepe was waiting for them with his LaSalle when they reached the\r\nbottom of Monte Azul. \"How good are you with tourists?\" Hall asked. \"I\r\nwant to show the senorita New San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can drive you with my eyes closed,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\nHall laughed. \"Keep your eyes open. And your four wheels on the\r\npavement,\" he said. \"Or I'll kill you with your own gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no fears of you,\" Pepe said. \"Get in.\"\r\n\r\nHall held onto Jerry's hand as he described the sights that rolled by\r\ntheir window. Big Pepe handled the car like a model tourists' chauffeur.\r\nIt rolled along smoothly, not too quickly, and when Hall tapped him on\r\nthe shoulder he would stop, the motor running softly while Hall made his\r\nexplanations to Jerry.\r\n\r\nAt six, Hall and Jerry agreed to have one last drink before parting for\r\nthe night. \"Let's ask the driver, too,\" he suggested. \"He's a nice guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. So are you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pepe, how about joining us for a drink at that bar near the Libro del\r\nMundo?\"\r\n\r\nPepe turned around and grinned at them. \"With many thanks,\" he said. \"I\r\nwill join you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we don't all join our ancestors first. Watch the road, you Asturian\r\nmurderer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I take it,\" Jerry laughed, \"you were telling him to keep his eyes on\r\nthe wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're learning the language, _muchachita_.\"\r\n\r\nThey found an empty table on the sidewalk. Hall and Jerry had Scotch and\r\nsodas. Big Pepe ordered coffee. He was very happy to be with them. He\r\nbeamed continuously at the girl, and to Hall he swore that never had he\r\nseen a more magnificent woman. \"Of course,\" he purred, \"she could stand\r\nmore meat, but for a gringo, she is most magnificent.\"\r\n\r\n\"He says you're a sight for sore eyes,\" Hall translated.\r\n\r\n\"Then tell him to look at my face.\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman thanks you,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nJerry pointed to the bar. \"There's the little Dutchman,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAndrotten was standing alone at the bar, a wine glass in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll call him over. He's a lonesome bastard too.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman was delighted to see Hall. \"This is indeed a damn\r\nsurprise,\" he said. \"Join you at the table? Happy as hell to join you,\r\nMr. Hall. Ah, the nurse of the great doctor. Tell me, nurse, do you\r\nthink the doctor could cure my rheumatism?\" This, he made clear by his\r\ngesture of holding his side in mock agony and groaning, was meant to be\r\na joke.\r\n\r\nHall translated the joke for Pepe.\r\n\r\nThe driver nodded. \"I understood most of it,\" he admitted. \"One doesn't\r\ndrive American tourists for a century and learn nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha,\" Hall said. \"Pepe knows a few words of English, it develops.\"\r\n\r\nJerry turned to the driver, smiled sweetly at him. \"Tell me,\" she said,\r\n\"did you ever have your eyes scratched out?\"\r\n\r\nPepe grinned, shrugged his huge shoulders. \"Did the senorita say I have\r\nnice eyes?\" he asked Hall.\r\n\r\n\"No, Pepe. She said your eyes can bring you trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe Asturiano closed his eyes and drew his finger across his throat,\r\nmaking the appropriate sounds. \"I understand perfectly,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Let's sit down one of these days,\" Androtten said to Hall. \"I am\r\nwilling as hell to give you the damn story of what the Japanese did to\r\nme in Java, if you are still damn willing to listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am. Anxious as hell, Mr. Androtten.\" He explained to Big Pepe\r\nwhat had happened to the little man. Pepe's face instantly reflected his\r\ndeep sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to break up this nice party,\" Jerry said, \"but I have to go to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we take you back to the Bolivar, Mr. Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet. I have a damn appointment here at seven.\"\r\n\r\nHall put some money on the table and followed Jerry to the car. \"I\r\nforgot to tell you,\" he said. \"There'll be a government car waiting to\r\npick you up at ten to seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poor man,\" Pepe sighed. \"The cruel Japanese!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been a wonderful day, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do we repeat it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell. I'll leave a message for you tonight when I get back.\"\r\n\r\nHall ate alone after Jerry went to the laboratory, and then wandered\r\naround the dark streets of the waterfront, thinking how he could\r\norganize his work. That was the damned job, always. Planning your moves.\r\nDeciding exactly what it is you're after and then organizing a method of\r\ngetting it. The letter to Santiago. That was a good start. With luck,\r\nthere would be an answer in a week. But was a week too far away? How\r\nsick was Tabio, and could he hold out for another week? And anyway, was\r\nAnsaldo a fascist?\r\n\r\nThe face of Varela Ansaldo would not leave Hall's mind. Maybe Fielding\r\ncould find out something, anything. At this moment, Fielding was\r\nprobably eating a little crow with his dinner at the British Embassy.\r\nBut would they tell Fielding anything? Did they know anything? And who\r\nthe hell was Fielding and how in hell did he get the dope in his\r\nreports? _No, my fine impertinent friend, I am not a British agent._ He\r\nwas the father of Sergeant Harold Fielding who hopped out of the wicker\r\npony cart and picked up one of those thin rifles and died at Jarama.\r\n\r\nSantiago's answer. There was the best bet. If the boys in Havana had no\r\ndope, at least they would tell him who to contact in San Hermano, and it\r\nwas a safe bet that when Pedro de Aragon (or would it be a love letter\r\nfrom Maria de Aragon?) wrote, the letter would lead him to someone who\r\nwould know Souza and Pepe Delgado. They were O.K., but just a little\r\ncautious, and this business of squiring Ansaldo's nurse would not set\r\ntoo well with them unless Ansaldo was not Gamburdo's man at all.\r\n\r\nHall was turning a corner when he first noticed the little man walking\r\nin the shadows of the opposite sidewalk. A little man in a black suit\r\nand a dirty stiff straw hat. Hall slowed his steps, waited for the man\r\nin the straw hat to walk closer to the yellowed street light. The man\r\nslowed down, too. Hall kept walking. He headed for an avenue, found a\r\ncab, told the driver to take him to La Perrichola. He looked around to\r\nsee the little man get into the other cab at the stand.\r\n\r\n\"I changed my mind,\" Hall told the driver. \"Take me to the Ritz\r\ninstead.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly into the lobby of the Ritz. It was one of the more\r\nmodern hotels in New San Hermano. He found a phone booth and called\r\nSouza. \"Where's Pepe?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Right outside. Do you need him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much. Tell him to pick me up near the back entrance of the Ritz.\r\nI'm too drunk to trust a strange driver.\"\r\n\r\nSouza laughed. \"You Americans,\" he said. \"Pepe will be there in five\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nHall went to the bar, had a short brandy. The little man was sitting\r\nbehind a potted palm near the street doorway, his face buried in a\r\nmagazine. Hall looked at his watch and walked to the elevator. \"Sixth\r\nfloor,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe walked through the sixth-floor hall, took the back stairs to the\r\nfourth floor, and then looked out of the window at the landing. Big\r\nPepe's LaSalle was parked near the servants' door. Hall listened for the\r\nsound of footsteps on the stairs above him. Quietly, he walked to the\r\nbasement, nodded at a waiter relaxing on a bench near the door, and\r\nwalked slowly to the LaSalle.\r\n\r\n\"_Que pasa?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble. Drive a few blocks down and then come back slowly toward the\r\nfront of the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit with me,\" Pepe said. He tapped the pistol in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Hall got down on the floor of the back part of the car. \"And take\r\nyour white hat off.\"\r\n\r\nThe car shot down three streets, then Pepe turned the corner, rode a\r\nblock, and started to crawl along the street on which the main entrance\r\nof the Ritz opened. \"Souza said you were in trouble,\" Pepe said. \"He\r\nsays you are not a _borracho_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was followed. Watch for a little man in a black suit and a stiff\r\nstraw hat. Park a block from the entrance to the Ritz and keep your\r\nmotor running.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Claro._\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he tried to sell me perfume this afternoon when I was walking\r\nwith that nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"She needs no perfume,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"She is not my woman,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that other woman who came with the doctor?\" Big Pepe\r\nsnorted violently. \"I hate _maricones_,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I hate them too, Pepe. Did you know that Franco is also a homosexual?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are all _maricones_. Hitler, Franco. They are all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Putas y maricones_,\" Hall said. \"_La Nueva Espana!_\"\r\n\r\nBig Pepe cleared his throat and spat out of the window. \"Arriba Espana.\"\r\nHall could feel the low, toneless laugh in the Asturian's throat.\r\n\r\n\"I think I see your dog,\" Pepe said. He described him for Hall. \"He acts\r\nas if he lost something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Falangista?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Ever seen him before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? _Mira!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't look. What's he doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiring a car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow him. But ...\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mira, chico_, that I can do with my eyes closed. And he won't know me\r\nfor the offal on the streets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't lose him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd sooner lose my _cojones_.\" He started the car, slowly. \"I am\r\nmagnificent at this,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the war I did this all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When he stops, watch where he goes but don't stop yourself. Keep going\r\nafter he stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Pepe said. \"I am not new at this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"That girl with the nice hair, _companero_. Why don't you take her into\r\nyour bed some night? I think she would be very good there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be very hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still following the little dog. We're moving toward the Plaza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pepe. The Englishman's son. Did you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very young. I only saw him once. He was very brave, _companero_.\r\nThe Centro Asturiano sent flowers to his father when the boy was killed.\r\nHe died for the Republic, you know.\" Pepe slowed the car.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's stopping. We're on the Calle de Virtudes. He's going into a cafe.\r\nI'll keep going.\"\r\n\r\nThe car covered another block. Pepe turned the corner and stopped. \"You\r\ncan sit up now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHall saw where he was. \"Which bar did he go to?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"El Siglo. There's another cafe next door. You can sit behind a hedge at\r\na table there and watch El Siglo. I have done it many times. I'll park\r\nthe car across the street and watch for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we can do this alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do we have to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? It is the little dog's next move.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could you get some friends now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. How many?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few. I'll keep an eye on El Siglo.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Pepe said. \"But we shouldn't lose the little dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a chance we must take. If we lose him tonight, we will follow\r\nhim tomorrow. He will be in my footsteps again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" Big Pepe said. \"I will be back soon.\" He drove off down\r\nthe back street.\r\n\r\nLike El Siglo, the cafe where Hall found a table near a boxed hedge on\r\nthe sidewalk faced the entrance to the apartments of the Presidencia.\r\nThe lights were on again in the fourth floor. Hall wondered if the\r\ndoctors were poking poor Tabio at that moment.\r\n\r\nHe ordered a pot of coffee and sat back to watch the entrance to El\r\nSiglo. A newsboy sold him a late paper, but Hall gave up trying to read\r\nit after a few minutes. He bought a box of wax matches and some cigars,\r\nturning his back to El Siglo when the tip of his first match flared into\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nLess than ten minutes after Hall started his vigil, the little man in\r\nthe straw hat walked out of El Siglo and sat down behind the wheel of a\r\nRenault parked at the curb. He sat alone in the car, his face turned\r\ntoward the Presidencia. Hall looked nervously up the street for a sign\r\nof Big Pepe. He jotted the license number of the Renault down on the\r\nmargin of his newspaper.\r\n\r\nThere was still no sign of Big Pepe.\r\n\r\nThe man in the Renault pressed the squeaky rubber horn twice. Another\r\nman walked quickly out of El Siglo and got into the back seat of the\r\nRenault. Hall squirmed in his chair and looked vainly for Big Pepe. The\r\npassenger was Wilhelm Androtten.\r\n\r\nHall watched the Renault start to move up the Plaza. It rode around the\r\nentire Plaza, and, as it started to pass the cafes again, Hall saw that\r\nit was following a black limousine which had just left the Presidencia\r\nafter picking up two passengers.\r\n\r\nThe black limousine was doing about thirty, picking its way out\r\ncarefully in the half darkness of the old city. As it passed directly in\r\nfront of Hall's table, one of the people sitting in the back seat lit a\r\ncigarette. In the light of the match, Hall could see that it was Varela\r\nAnsaldo.\r\n\r\nHe had to wait another ten minutes for Big Pepe, who returned with two\r\nyoung men. \"We lost him, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hijo de puta!_ I told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Relax. I know who he works for. We can find them on our own terms now.\r\nI saw them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\nHall looked at the two young men sharing the front seat with Pepe.\r\n\"Introduce me to your friends,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBig Pepe grinned. \"That is your right,\" he said. \"This is my nephew\r\nMiguelito, and this is Juan Antonio Martinez. They're school teachers.\"\r\nThe last he said with almost boastful pride.\r\n\r\nThe teachers were both slim lads in their early twenties. Hall shook\r\ntheir hands and got into the back of the car. \"Let's drive out to the\r\nbeach and talk,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Miguelito said. \"It would not be wise. There are too many\r\nstrangers there.\"\r\n\r\nHis colleague grunted. \"Your pistol, Miguelito,\" he said. \"Take it out\r\nof your pocket. It is digging a new hole in my arse.\"\r\n\r\n\"They talk that way all the time,\" Pepe said, tolerantly. \"But they are\r\nvery educated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry if I talk like a worker,\" Juan Antonio said to Pepe. \"My\r\nfather was only a miner. I apologize, Your Eminence.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is joking,\" Pepe said. \"Miguelito, you are a Bachelor of Arts. Tell\r\nme, do workers joke, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, both of you,\" Miguelito said. \"_Companero_ Hall will think we're\r\nall crazy.\"\r\n\r\nHall laughed. \"I've seen boys like you before,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We were too young to go then,\" Juan Antonio said. \"But if they try it\r\nhere, the streets of San Hermano will run with blood before we let the\r\nfascists win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Juan Antonio is a Communist,\" Big Pepe said.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not deny it. \"Remember my words,\" he said, \"the flag of the\r\nFalange will never fly over San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we are still alive,\" Miguelito added.\r\n\r\n\"Will you listen to these children?\" Pepe asked. \"As soon as you turn\r\nyour back they put on the _pantalones_ and make the noises of a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"This little dog of a fascist who followed you,\" Miguelito said, \"who is\r\nhis superior?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, _companeros_. It could be Hitler....\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be Franco,\" Big Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"He said that,\" Juan Antonio said. \"He said Hitler, didn't he,\r\nMiguelito?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet,\" Miguelito said. \"This is no joke. You said you saw him with his\r\nsuperior?\"\r\n\r\nHall smiled at the boy. \"Listen, _chico_,\" he said, \"men with more\r\npistols than you have tried to put words in my mouth before. All they\r\ngot from my mouth was my spit.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ole!_\" Juan Antonio punched Miguelito's shoulders with glee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouza was reading a fat book at his desk when Hall returned to the\r\nBolivar. He greeted the boys with familiarity. \"They are reliable,\" he\r\nsaid after they left.\r\n\r\n\"I know. I was sober when I called you before. But tonight your reliable\r\nboys nearly drank me under the table trying to find out who was with the\r\nlittle dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"The one who followed you to the Ritz?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same one. They also told me that you are President of the Hotel\r\nClerks Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got a cigarette? Thanks. No, I've got matches.\" Hall looked around to\r\nsee if he and Souza were alone. Quietly, he said, \"Androtten was the man\r\nI saw with the little dog.\"\r\n\r\nSouza's face grew grimmer. \"I don't think I am surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But I don't trust him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe this will help you.\" Hall handed him the license number of the\r\nRenault. \"It's the number of the car they used.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will help,\" Souza said.\r\n\r\n\"What time did Ansaldo get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not get in, yet. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Androtten was following his car, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Androtten is out, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we have something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a message in your box.\" It was a note from Jerry. She was\r\ngoing to work all day and had to attend a party at the American Embassy\r\nin the evening. But she would call him in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"I am watching her,\" Hall explained.\r\n\r\nThe trace of a smile flitted across the long face of the night clerk. \"I\r\nknow,\" he said. \"Pepe told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll kill him,\" Hall laughed. \"I'm going to bed. Leave a note in my box\r\nabout when they get in.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to his room. When he turned on the light, he saw that a note had\r\nbeen slipped under his door. It was from Jerry. \"Thanks for a lovely\r\nday,\" it said. \"I will call you before I leave for the lab.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter five_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was dreaming of the crowds in the bull ring at Badajoz, but there\r\nwere no bulls on the sand. It was the day of the massacre, the day when\r\nthe Portuguese troops herded the _milicianos_ and their families and\r\nhanded them over to the waiting _franquistas_ on the Spanish side of the\r\nborder. It was the day the _franquistas_ shoved the Republican families\r\non to the sand of the bull ring at Badajoz and set up the heavy machine\r\nguns in the boxes and fired away until every human being on the field\r\nlay choking and dying in his own blood. In his dream Hall saw grand\r\nladies in mantillas in the boxes that day tossing roses and perfumed\r\nkerchiefs to the animals at the machine guns, and in his dream he even\r\nknew that the perfume on the kerchiefs came from a certain shop in\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\nThen Hall spotted a crowd of German and Spanish officers in another box\r\nand he leaped at them, his right hand gripping the ugly clasp knife in\r\nhis pocket. There were nine officers in the box, four of them Nazis and\r\none a gaudy Italian colonel and the rest were Spanish fascists in capes\r\nand one of them wore a Requete beret, although his cape carried the\r\ngolden embroidered five arrows of the Falange. They began to flee from\r\ntheir box in a panic, but Hall managed to get a quick look at one of the\r\nSpaniards and then flung his knife at the Spaniard's retreating back.\r\nThen the bells began to toll in the churches and carabineros left their\r\nmachine guns and ran barehanded after Hall but the clang of the bells\r\nstarted to blot everything out and the church bells of Badajoz blended\r\ninto the steady drone of a smaller bell in Hall's ears and he awoke to\r\nthe phone bell which had abruptly brought him back to San Hermano.\r\n\r\n\"Did I wake you up?\" It was Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. What time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop groaning. Wash your face and I'll call you back in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nLater, she asked him if he had been having a bad dream and he said it\r\nhad been closer to a nightmare in technicolor. \"About the war?\" she\r\nasked, and he said it had been about the war.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"I wish you never have another nightmare as long as\r\nyou live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"Do we have breakfast together?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'm leaving with the doctors in a few minutes. Work all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's out, too. I have to go to a party with the doctors at the\r\nAmerican Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I was invited, too. I'll see you there.\" There was a long pause\r\nat the girl's end of the wire, and Hall said, \"Jerry? Are you still\r\nlistening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. You're a darling. I've got to hang up now. I've got to be out\r\nof here in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" he said. \"See you tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached the lobby at half-past eight. There was no message in his\r\nbox, and he could see that Jerry's key was already in the cubicle. \"I'll\r\nbe in the dining room if anyone phones,\" he told the day clerk. He\r\nbought a paper from a boy standing near the entrance of the Bolivar and\r\nwent in to eat.\r\n\r\nHall was having his second cup of coffee when Androtten entered the\r\ndining room. The little Dutchman smiled happily when he spotted Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, good morning,\" he shouted. \"Hell of a nice day, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nice and sunny,\" Hall said. \"Eating alone? Take a chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Mr. Hall. Damn nice of you.\"\r\n\r\nHall wanted to shove the incongruous hells and damns down the pink face\r\nof the Hollander. \"Not at all,\" he said. \"I like company.\" But the\r\nbeaming Dutchman brought goose pimples to his spine this morning.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Hall said, rising. \"I'll be back in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the desk, picked up a pad of cable blanks and an indelible\r\npencil. Then, at the table, he sat with pencil poised over the pad and\r\nsmiled at Androtten. \"Mine is a funny business,\" he said. \"When you get\r\nto the capital of a country you can't go right to work, you know. Far\r\nfrom it, Androtten. First you smooch around the town like a prowler,\r\ntalking to taxi drivers and bartenders and ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon my ignorance, Mr. Hall. But _smooch_? Is it a real word or\r\njournalists' slang?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'd call it slang. I mean you have to mingle with the little\r\npeople to get an idea of the currents.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you get this idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you get the idea, you can go to work.\" Hall wrote the name and\r\naddress of the editor of one of the big weeklies in the States on the\r\nblank. \"Vice-President Gamburdo is man of hour here today,\" he wrote.\r\n\"Tomorrow may be man of hour in all Latin America. Arranging for\r\ninterview. Can you use? Matthew Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now you are working?\"\r\n\r\nHall turned the blank around so that Androtten could read the text of\r\nhis cable. \"I'll let you in on my secret,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman read the text. \"Interesting,\" he said. \"Damn interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid it's just routine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never that.\" The Dutchman sighed. \"When such vital personalities as\r\nSenor Gamburdo are routine to you, Mr. Hall, I imagine that my story has\r\nonly a small chance of ever being told. But I suppose that is merely as\r\nit should be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no, Mr. Androtten. I'll tell you what we'll do. As soon as I have\r\nmy interview with Gamburdo, we'll sit down and have our chat and then\r\nI'll query the _Saturday Evening Post_ or _Collier's_ and whatever they\r\noffer we'll split down the middle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You make me happy as hell, Mr. Hall. But please, money is no object.\r\nPlease keep all of the money.\"\r\n\r\nHall shook his head. \"We'll fight that out later,\" he said. \"Cigar?\"\r\n\r\nAndrotten demurred. His heart was not strong enough for cigars that\r\nearly in the morning, he explained. \"In Java I was healthier than an\r\nox,\" he said. \"But the damn Japanese ...\" He let the rest of the\r\nsentence remain unspoken.\r\n\r\nThrough the open window of the dining room, Hall saw Pepe's LaSalle\r\ndrive up to the Bolivar.\r\n\r\nHe excused himself with an \"I'll be seeing you,\" and walked out to the\r\ndesk. He handed the cable blank to the day clerk. \"Send it press rate\r\ncollect,\" he said.\r\n\r\nPepe had a message for Hall from Souza. Ansaldo had returned to the\r\nBolivar at 3:14 A.M., twenty-three minutes before Wilhelm Androtten.\r\nThey had both left calls to be awakened at eight in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"That all Souza said?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the complete message.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's something, anyway.\" The papers said that Ansaldo was to\r\nspend the morning at the bedside of President Tabio.\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gobernacion Building. But not right away. Drive somewhere where we can\r\nhave a coffee together. I'd like to talk to you first.\"\r\n\r\nPepe took him to a little workers' restaurant on the edges of the\r\nbusiness section of New San Hermano. It was evident that he had had\r\nlittle sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Tired?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\nThe driver whistled, softly. \"Like a corpse,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\nAn amused grimace distorted Hall's face. \"What a corpse!\" he said. \"Why\r\ndidn't you tell the boys who followed the teachers and me from the cafe\r\nlast night to be better than the little dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kept tripping over them all the way home.\"\r\n\r\nPepe thought it was very funny. \"They pledged their lives to protect\r\nyours, the bunglers. Reliable, but clumsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not angry,\" Hall said. \"I am grateful.\"\r\n\r\n\"For nothing,\" Pepe protested.\r\n\r\n\"Pepe, do you know why I came to San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\nThe big Asturian shrugged his shoulders. \"You never told me, or\r\nFernando. Miguelito and his friend said you have the mouth of a clam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to know why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never question friends. You are a friend.\"\r\n\r\nHall looked up at Pepe Delgado and wanted to tell him how much he\r\nreminded him of the best of the men he had met in Spain, the best of the\r\nofficers and _milicianos_ who never, even in the heat of battle, forgot\r\nthe feelings and the sacred _dignidad_ of their fellow men.\r\n\r\n\"Mother of God!\" Pepe laughed. \"Don't look at me as if I were that girl\r\nwith the red hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good _companero_,\" Hall said. \"In a few days, perhaps I can\r\ntell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never ask questions of friends,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"I know. Did Souza tell you what I told him last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only about when Ansaldo and Androtten came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you reach Souza today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then listen. Tonight, he must find some excuse for moving me into the\r\nroom next to Ansaldo--if there is such a room. Do you think he can do\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nPepe grabbed the check for the coffee, refused to relinquish it to Hall.\r\n\"This is my table,\" he said with quiet dignity. He also refused to\r\ndiscuss his fee for driving Hall around San Hermano for days.\r\n\"_Manana_,\" he laughed. \"But about the room. I think Fernando can\r\narrange it. The wife of the owner of the Bolivar is a member of the\r\nCentro Asturiano. She is also a first cousin of Dr. Gonzalez.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he can do it,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"_Hola!_\" Pepe boomed. \"_Que tal?_\" He exchanged loud pleasantries with\r\na chauffeur who came in and sat down at a table in the corner.\r\n\r\n\"A Gallego,\" he explained to Hall. \"But otherwise a pretty decent man.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many decent Gallegos,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nPepe whistled through his teeth, shook the limp and dangling fingers of\r\nhis right hand, and looked behind his back. Hall grinned. Pepe's gesture\r\nwas as old as Spain.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Pepe,\" he laughed, \"we have much to do. And all in a very short\r\ntime. I am going to see the Press Secretary in the Gobernacion. I am\r\nrequesting an interview with Gamburdo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo is a _cabron_,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"I know. In my eyes he is an _hijo de la gran puta_. But for the present\r\nI want Gamburdo and his friends to think that I am an admirer of the\r\n_cabrito_. Clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Tell all of this to Souza when you drop me at Gobernacion. When\r\ncan you see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try to see him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bueno._ Let's go, then.\"\r\n\r\nIn the car, Hall had a fresh idea. \"This young Juan Antonio, the\r\nteacher. Is he really a Communist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Member of the party?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. He writes for _Mundo Obrero_ regularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. If you see him, ask him to go to the Communist headquarters and\r\nfrom there to telephone a friend. From there, understand? Tell him to\r\ncall any friend. No, wait. Make it a friend in the office of _Mundo\r\nObrero_. I want him to denounce me to this friend as an admirer of\r\nGamburdo and an enemy of Tabio.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea that Gamburdo has made some changes since he became\r\nActing President,\" Hall answered. \"If he has, he's got some Cross and\r\nSword bastards listening in on all Communist phones.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" Pepe said. \"I will discuss your idea with Juan\r\nAntonio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk him into it, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\nPepe stopped the car in front of the Gobernacion building. He promised\r\nto meet Hall at the Bolivar in two hours.\r\n\r\nHall entered the polished marble corridors of the Gobernacion. There was\r\na popular song about this building. Hall thought of the words, written\r\nby no known poet, and yet so well known in the nation that it had become\r\nthe unofficial anthem of the Hermanitos in the guerrilla armies which\r\nhad fought the Seguristas. Even today, after nearly three decades, San\r\nHermano youngsters learned the words from slightly older playmates when\r\nthey were barely old enough to play by themselves. Somehow, the kids of\r\nthe city sang a slightly less ribald version of the ballad of the\r\n_edificio magnifico_ which cost the nation over twenty million pesos and\r\nwhich, the song maintained, supported a village full of Don Augusto's\r\nwhores and bastards.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see the Press Secretary,\" Hall told an attendant in the right\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" the attendant laughed. \"He resigned last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't anyone take his place?\"\r\n\r\nThe attendant was a very old man. He leaned back in his chair and with\r\nan eloquent look gave Hall to understand that he had completely lost\r\npatience with the visitor. \"_Chico_,\" he said, \"no one could take Don\r\nPascual's place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, _viejo_, I am in a hurry. Is anyone trying to take Don\r\nPascual's place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" The old man shifted in his chair. With withering scorn he raised\r\nhis arm and pointed a handful of gnarled brown fingers at a door marked\r\n_Prensa_. There were many other men in San Hermano who pointed to things\r\nwith just that gesture. Hall recognized the gesture at once. He had seen\r\nit for the first time in Geneva, when Anibal Tabio rose to make that\r\ngesture toward the pile of captured Italian and German military\r\ndocuments with which the Spaniards had tried to impress the League.\r\n\r\nHall smiled with compassion at the figure of the old man imitating the\r\ngesture of his idolized President.\r\n\r\n\"Go in, go in,\" the old man said, petulantly. \"Go in and see that burro\r\nof a dolt who is _trying_ to take Don Pascual's place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has this burro a name?\"\r\n\r\n\"The burro has a name. It is Valenti. Now you made me say the\r\nunspeakable name! Please, _chico_, in the name of my sainted mother and\r\nthe Educator, go away!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's attitude told Hall more about what Gamburdo had already\r\ndone to the Press Bureau than he could have learned in a week of routine\r\ndigging. He handed the old man a cigar and a box of matches and walked\r\nthrough the door to Valenti's office. He found himself in a small\r\nanteroom facing a dark-haired girl pecking genteely at the keys of a\r\ntypewriter with creamy fingers whose long nails were painted a deep\r\nblood red. She was immaculately groomed and pretty.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to see Senor Valenti,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Your name, Senor?\"\r\n\r\nSo you had voice training, too, he thought. \"Matthew Hall,\" he said. \"I\r\nam a journalist from New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"How nice!\" The secretary switched to English immediately. There was\r\nonly the slightest suggestion of an accent to her English, and over the\r\nfaint Spanish intonations she tried to impose the broad a's of something\r\nresembling the Oxford drawl. \"It is quite a relief to speak English\r\nduring office hours, really.\" She pronounced it as \"re-ahl-y.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours is a very good English, Miss ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Vardieno,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Pick it up in school in San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Vardieno made a mouth of disdain. \"Heavens, no!\" she said. \"Dad\r\nsent me to finishing school in the States. Stuffy old place, but\r\ncharming in its own Adirondack way. Besides, I could always sneak down\r\nto town for a week-end when it became too boring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Hall smiled. \"Nothing like good old New York to work off a\r\nbore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how! What brings you to this forsaken village?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pan American Airways,\" he laughed. \"There's a flight out of Miami every\r\ntwo days they tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed with him. \"O.K.,\" she said. \"I asked for it. I'll find\r\nout if Mr. Valenti can see you now.\" She pushed her chair back and got\r\nup, pausing mid-way long enough to give Hall a fleeting look at her\r\nbreasts with a casualness she had never learned in the Adirondacks. But\r\nHall had eyes only for the pendant which dangled at the end of a thin\r\nplatinum chain. When she sat at her desk or stood erect, Miss Vardieno's\r\nCross and Sword emblem sank neatly below the neck line of her blue New\r\nYork dress.\r\n\r\n\"There are so many lovely sights in San Hermano,\" Hall sighed as the\r\ngirl walked into the private office.\r\n\r\nShe was in the private office for quite some time. Emerging, she had\r\nregained her finishing-school poise. \"I am so sorry,\" she said. \"Mr.\r\nValenti is tied up in a conference that will last for hours. Our\r\nCongress opens in five days, you know, and what with the situation being\r\nwhat it is, Mr. Hall, it is the feeling of the Press Director that it\r\nwill be impossible for any writer to obtain an interview with Mr.\r\nGamburdo until after the Congress convenes.\"\r\n\r\nNice going, he thought. \"An interview with the Vice-President? But how\r\ndid Mr. Valenti know that was what I wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Mr. Hall. I guess he just presumed. Every one wants to\r\ninterview Mr. Gamburdo these days. If it keeps up I guess he'll make the\r\ncover of _Time_, don't you think?\" She sat down and propped up a flower\r\nsagging over the rim of the crystal vase on her desk. \"Our pretty\r\ntropical blooms are too darned delicate, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Hall said, thinking not of the broken blossom but of the\r\nspeed with which the text of his cable had reached Gamburdo's new Press\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nMiss Vardieno brushed an imaginary fleck of dust from her skirt. \"Well,\r\nanyway,\" she said in her best bored-with-it-all nuance, \"he's going to\r\nbe a vast improvement over Tovarich Tabio.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be seeing you,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a stranger now,\" Miss Vardieno said. \"It's such a relief to\r\nspeak English during office hours.\"\r\n\r\nHall closed the door behind him and started to whistle the ballad about\r\nthe graft that built the marble halls of Gobernacion's _edificio\r\nmagnifico_. \"You're right,\" he told the old attendant. \"Valenti can\r\nnever wear Don Pascual's _pantalones_.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's dry cackle followed Hall down the swirling marble stairs.\r\nHall walked out to the Avenida de la Liberacion, looked in all\r\ndirections for the man who had followed him the night before. The yellow\r\nstraw hat was nowhere in sight. He turned his steps toward the\r\nfashionable shopping district directly south on the avenue. If his\r\nshadow were on him, he would flush him by walking down the broad, sunny\r\navenue.\r\n\r\nThe shopping district brought no sign of the \"little dog.\" Hall shopped\r\nthe plate-glass windows, hoping to catch a tell-tale glimpse of anyone\r\nwho might be on his heels. He went into a department store, bought a\r\ntropical dinner suit, and arranged to have it altered and delivered to\r\nthe Bolivar at five. Then, after selecting a maroon tie and a shirt, he\r\nfound a phone booth and called Fielding's office.\r\n\r\nA Spanish-speaking secretary answered the phone. Fielding was in Alcala\r\nat an auction, she said. \"Please have him call Father Arupe's\r\nsecretary,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nThe hot noon-day sun forced Hall to abandon his ideas of taking a\r\nleisurely stroll to the Bolivar. He found a rickety cab and relaxed on\r\nthe dusty cushions. Fielding was the man he needed now, Fielding might\r\nbe able to make Androtten show his cards, Fielding might have some of\r\nthe answers about the new Press Chief and his brand-new secretary. And\r\nif Souza could find out who owned the Renault Androtten and the little\r\ndog used, maybe Fielding could tie the information into some of his own\r\ndata and come up with something. Then when the boys in Havana answered\r\nthat screwy letter perhaps they'd all have something to go by. In three\r\ndays at the outside there would be word from Havana. Three days of\r\nwaiting and accepting Souza and Pepe and even Fielding on faith.\r\n\r\nAt the Bolivar, the desk clerk told Hall that Pepe had called to say\r\nthat he was having some minor engine trouble and would be delayed for\r\nabout an hour. Hall noted the word \"minor\" and put it down to a delay in\r\nreaching Souza or Juan Antonio. He ordered a jug of iced pineapple juice\r\nsent up and went to his room. The long walk down the Avenida de la\r\nLiberacion under the broiling sun had covered Hall with sweat. He\r\nstripped and went to the bathroom. A slow gust of air hissed out of the\r\nfaucets when Hall turned the taps. He washed his face with cold water at\r\nthe basin while waiting for the pressure to force up the water to the\r\nbath faucets.\r\n\r\nBut no water came. The hissing ceased, the faucets went bone dry. Hall\r\nphoned the news down to the desk.\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry, Senor,\" the clerk said. \"But all the baths on your line\r\nseem to have gone dry. The manager has sent for a plumber.\"\r\n\r\nHall stretched out on his bed and tried to relax.\r\n\r\nThe desk clerk phoned him back. \"Can I send the plumber up?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\" Hall put on his pants and a pair of slippers. More than anything\r\nelse, at this moment, he wanted to wallow in a cold tub. The plumber,\r\nwho looked enough like Pepe Delgado to be his twin, had other ideas.\r\n\r\n\"It is very serious, Senor,\" he complained. \"There will be no water from\r\nthese rotted pipes in a century.\" He banged the pipes with one tool and\r\ntwisted them with another, cursing them as he worked. \"It is very\r\nserious,\" he concluded. \"I can do nothing on them today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother of God!\" Hall said, and then he saw the sly smile on the\r\nplumber's massive face.\r\n\r\n\"Even She couldn't get any water from these pipes,\" the plumber said.\r\n\r\n\"How am I going to bathe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? Maybe the manager will give you another room where the bath\r\nstill works.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. Well, thanks for trying.\"\r\n\r\n\"For nothing, Senor.\" The plumber picked up his tools and left.\r\n\r\nHall dressed and joined Pepe in the car. \"What did the plumber say?\"\r\nPepe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Enough. Let's have a quick lunch somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Souza is changing your room tonight. He is also changing the rooms of\r\nfour other guests. They have no water either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work. Where are we eating?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I stop the car you'll find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the plumber your brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"My cousin. I also spoke to Juan Antonio. He made that telephone call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you very hungry?\" Hall asked. \"I want to buy you half a steer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could eat half a steer, _companero_. And I know where to get it,\r\ntoo.\" He drove to an old garden restaurant near the beach. \"Here they\r\nserve the best meat in San Hermano. And at low prices, too.\"\r\n\r\nPepe did ample justice to a tremendous steak. He washed it down with a\r\nquart of beer, chiding Hall for confining his luncheon to a simple\r\nroast-beef sandwich. \"Such food is all right for little children, Senor\r\nHall. But you are a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should eat like a man, _Companero_ Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel like eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go to a good doctor. Or take that red-headed woman into your bed\r\nfor a night. You'd eat in the morning, _chico_!\"\r\n\r\nHall laughed. \"I'd rather see a doctor,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A doctor?\" Pepe grew serious. \"Is anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? This Dr. Gonzales you mentioned. Is he a medico?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Would you like to see him, _Companero_ Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we see him after lunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now is the best time. He's surely taking a little siesta, and it is\r\nbetter not to telephone. His daughter is at school all day. Come on,\r\nI'll drive you over.\"\r\n\r\nThey got into the car and Pepe swung into a street with a trolley track\r\nthat led them to a middle-class suburb. He stopped in front of a gray\r\nframe house similar to any doctor's house in an American town. A fat and\r\nancient Persian cat was sleeping in the shadiest part of the porch. Pepe\r\nmeowed at the cat. She opened a lazy eye, yawned, and went back to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\"The cat and her master always take their siesta at the same time,\" Pepe\r\nexplained. \"It is a very intelligent cat.\" He opened the screen door.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no bell?\"\r\n\r\n\"He disconnects the bell when he naps.\" Pepe led Hall into a cool,\r\nshaded living room. There was no rug on the highly polished redwood\r\nfloor. The furniture was made by native craftsmen of bamboo and wicker,\r\nalthough the designs reflected the functional modernism of the Bauhaus\r\nschool. It was the first modern furniture Hall had ever seen in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nPepe noticed Hall's interest. \"The doctor has many peasant projects,\" he\r\nexplained. \"He brought some Spanish refugees from Madrid to the country\r\nto teach the peasants how to make good furniture. They have a big\r\nco-operative shop in the southern province near the Little River. Sit\r\ndown in one of these new chairs. I'll get him.\"\r\n\r\nHall relaxed in one of the low-slung chairs while Pepe went to the rear\r\npart of the house. \"He's not on the couch in his office,\" Pepe said. He\r\nwent to the foot of the stairs leading into the foyer. \"_Hola!_ It's\r\nDelgado! _Hola!_ Don Manuel, it's Delgado!\" His shouts would have roused\r\nthe dead. He turned around and winked to Hall. \"_Abajo_ Anibal Tabio!\"\r\nhe shouted. \"_Viva_ Gamburdo! _Viva_ Segura! _Abajo_ Tabio!\"\r\n\r\nUpstairs there was the sound of a book or a heavy shoe dropping to the\r\nfloor. \"Bandit!\" someone shouted, and then a tall graying man in his\r\nstockinged feet shuffled to the head of the stairs, rubbing his eyes and\r\ncursing Pepe with a mock cantankerousness. \"_Bulto_,\" he shouted. \"Give\r\na man a chance to put on his shoes. Show some respect for my degrees!\"\r\n\r\nPepe made a low, courtly stage bow. \"Forgive me, Your Eminence,\" he\r\npleaded. \"I am only a simple petitioner.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Momentico, companero._\" The doctor went to his room for a pair of\r\nhuaraches.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, I want you to meet _Companero_ Mateo Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Companero_ Hall!\" The doctor started to speak English. \"It is so good\r\nto finally meet you. Don Anibal gave me your book on Spain for Christmas\r\nwhen it was printed. He spoke to me about you very highly. Please, sit\r\ndown. You will find these chairs very comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pepe has been telling me about your co-operative.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not very large. Here, try this chair. It is my favorite.\"\r\n\r\nPepe reminded the doctor that Hall was in need of his professional\r\nservices. \"Excuse my bad manners, doctor,\" he said, \"but when you start\r\nto talk about your projects ...\"\r\n\r\n\"He is right,\" the doctor smiled. \"Sometimes I do talk too much. I like\r\nto talk, even when people don't really listen to me. Even in my sleep I\r\ntalk. About many things. Art. Weaving. World politics. The war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like to listen,\" Hall said. \"Where did you learn your English,\r\ndoctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"My English?\" The doctor leaned back in his chair, the smile of a man\r\nenjoying a highly private joke on his face. \"I am afraid, _companero_,\r\nthat I learned my English in the same sort of a place where you learned\r\nyour excellent Spanish. That is, in a dungeon built by the Kings of\r\nSpain.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Spain?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am not a Spaniard. My grandfathers were Spaniards, but my father\r\nand I were born here.\" He pointed to a framed flag of the Republic which\r\nhung on the wall over Hall's chair. \"That flag hung in my cell in El\r\nMoro for three years, and that flag was in my hands the day Segura's\r\ndeath opened the prison gates to all of us.\" The doctor was not aware\r\nthat he was now speaking in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor was in El Moro with Don Anibal,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" the doctor admitted. \"Nearly every patriot on the\r\nfaculty and so many of the students were there, too. I had just taken my\r\ndegree in medicine but I was still at the University as an instructor in\r\nbiology when the arrests began. But don't think it was all tears and\r\nterror. Don Anibal and his late cousin Federico formed the so-called\r\nUniversity Behind Bars. We had Chairs in Latin, English, biology,\r\nhistory, art, literature--everything. The soldiers, who were with us,\r\nsmuggled in our books and papers. Later, when the Seguristas were out of\r\npower, the students who were in prison were able to take their\r\nexaminations in the University of San Hermano, and the new Regents gave\r\nthem full academic credit for their studies at El Moro.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a sick man, doctor,\" Pepe said. \"Examine him first and talk to\r\nhim later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pepe is right, _Companero_ Hall. I do talk too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Any man who did three years in jail has a lot of talking to\r\ncatch up on when he gets out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will the examination take very long?\" Pepe asked. \"I have to go back to\r\ntown. I can pick you up later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you an hour?\" the doctor asked Hall.\r\n\r\n\"I have all day.\"\r\n\r\nPepe got up. \"I'll be back in two hours,\" he laughed. He walked out to\r\nthe porch. They heard him meow at the cat. Then the cat screeched and\r\nPepe howled.\r\n\r\n\"A cat is never completely civilized,\" Dr. Gonzales said. \"Poor Pepe\r\nrefuses to believe it. And now Grisita has scratched him again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wild beast!\" Pepe roared. \"She clawed me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come inside, and I'll fix it, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks. I've got iodine in my car.\"\r\n\r\nHall expected the doctor to be amused. Instead, a wave of profound\r\nsadness gripped the man. He took out a pocket handkerchief and ran it\r\nover his forehead. \"What's wrong, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" Gonzales said. \"I just can't stand the way they spare me.\r\nSince my illness it's been hell. For twelve years I was the National\r\nMinister of public health education. Don Anibal appointed me when he was\r\nMinister of Education. He created the job for me. Now I live on a\r\npension, and outside of the few hours I put in every week as a\r\nconsultant at the University and my handicraft projects, I do nothing.\r\nBiologically I am now a vegetable. And my good friends, the people of\r\nSan Hermano ...\"\r\n\r\n\"_Claro._ You mean they are too kind ...\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded. \"But they are my friends,\" he said. \"They do not do\r\nthis to hurt me. And now, what bothers you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My back. I think that I may have strained it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can examine you better in my office. It's in the next room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. But first, I'd like to talk to you about some other things.\r\nI don't know what's going on, but I do know that something is wrong. I\r\nknew Don Anibal in Geneva, and I know that if he were well, your country\r\nwould break with the Axis....\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed. \"You are not alone,\" he said. \"Don Anibal is a very\r\nsick man. No one seems to know what is wrong, exactly. He is paralyzed\r\nfrom the hips down, and he grows weaker every day. The mind is still\r\nstrong, but it must rest so much that none of us dare to tax Don Anibal\r\nwith worries other than his health. In the meanwhile, Gamburdo has taken\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Gamburdo? Is he honest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo is not a man of good will. He is a clever lawyer and a very\r\nintelligent man. His family prospered under Segura, but the General\r\nseduced a Gamburdo daughter, and that turned them against the\r\nSeguristas. Gamburdo volunteered his services as a lawyer when Tabio and\r\nthe Republican junta was in jail. But this offer was a calculating\r\ngamble. He knew that Segura's days were numbered; he knew that the\r\nleaders of the junta would be the new government of the nation. He\r\njoined the Party of Radical Socialism, but when he became its head, he\r\nsaw to it that, like himself, the party became neither radical nor\r\nsocialist.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was for Franco, you know,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"I know. He was for Franco and the Falange and against Tabio. But he is\r\nvery intelligent. He managed to keep these things nicely hidden. When\r\nTabio was elected President and created the new government of national\r\nunity, Gamburdo joined forces with Don Anibal--but only to destroy this\r\nunity from within.\r\n\r\n\"This is the least of his sins. It seems that he has kept all the\r\nRepublican doctors from the Presidencia. The only doctors Gamburdo has\r\npermitted are the reactionaries, the old servants of the Seguristas. We\r\ntried to talk to Don Anibal, but you know him and his saintly faith in\r\nthe goodness of Man. I think that, deliberately, he has placed his life\r\nin Gamburdo's hands as a lesson to all of his old friends in the need\r\nfor real unity. It is as if he means to prove to us, by getting well,\r\nthat unity is the most important issue in the nation today.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Dr. Ansaldo? Is he really good?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a great reputation. But it is a gamble for Gamburdo alone. If\r\nDon Anibal recovers, Gamburdo and his friends will say that it was a\r\nSpaniard who saved the President. If he dies--even a great Spanish\r\ndoctor could not save him. Either way, Gamburdo stands to gain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the office Hall took a chair facing the microscope on the doctor's\r\nwhite enameled metal desk. He watched the doctor hunt through the\r\ninstrument cases along the wall. On a lower shelf, the doctor found his\r\nstethoscope.\r\n\r\n\"Would you please remove your shirt?\"\r\n\r\nHall shook his head. \"No,\" he said. He gently took the stethoscope from\r\nthe doctor's hands, carefully folded it and put it away in a small\r\nwooden box he found on the desk. \"This is what I really came for,\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"My stethoscope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\" He explained to the doctor that with such instruments one\r\ncould easily hear through an average indoor wall. \"I have a queer\r\nfeeling,\" he said, \"that with your stethoscope I can perhaps get a hint\r\nas to what is actually wrong with Don Anibal,--or, at least, in San\r\nHermano.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave Hall his hand. \"I won't ask you any questions,\" he said.\r\n\"But may I wish you luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now let me fix you a cold drink. I'm not very good in the kitchen, but\r\nwe'll see what we can both do.\"\r\n\r\nPepe returned with news for Hall about the change of rooms at the hotel.\r\nHall now had the room next to Ansaldo's sitting room. He also told him\r\nthat the Spanish Republican societies were planning an _homenaje_ for\r\nHall. \"They formed a committee to arrange it with you, but I told them\r\nthat you didn't want to see them until next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you were pleasant,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I was, Mateo. I just thought you didn't want too much noise\r\nabout you in San Hermano for the next few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you're right, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a bath. I'm going to a party at the American Embassy tonight. But\r\ntomorrow I think we'll have a lot of work to do, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what happened to the little dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I'll know some more about him tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you got in the box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Medicine.\"\r\n\r\nPepe snorted. \"_Mierda!_\" he laughed. \"What you really need is ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Hall said, sharply. \"That girl with the red hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Pepe said. \"I am not a doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too modest, _ilustre_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a good time tonight. I'll be waiting for you in the morning. Or,\r\nif you change your mind, leave word with Fernando.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Until tomorrow, then.\" Hall got the key to his new room from the\r\nclerk, as well as the packages he had ordered earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nThe new room was larger than the other one. His clothes and bags had\r\nalready been moved in, and the chambermaid had made a creditable effort\r\nto put them away as Hall had previously done. Hall went to the window,\r\nsaw that it looked out on the Plaza. He adjusted his window shutters for\r\nprivacy. The wall between his room and Ansaldo's sitting room had only a\r\nbureau against it. Hall moved the chest slightly to one side, made room\r\nfor a small, solid chair. Then he took his bath.\r\n\r\nHe was shaving when he heard Ansaldo return to the Bolivar. He wrapped a\r\ntowel around his middle, put the plastic prongs of the stethoscope in\r\nhis ears, and sat down on the little chair facing the wall. The hearing\r\nend of the stethoscope picked up only footsteps. The sounds told their\r\nown story. The man in the next room was walking to the window, then\r\nopening the shutters, then sitting on the couch. There were other\r\nfootsteps, lighter and less pronounced. Perhaps another person in the\r\nroom was wearing soft slippers or going barefooted, like Hall himself.\r\n\r\n\"Are you tired, _ilustre_?\" It was Marina.\r\n\r\n\"No. Why should I be tired?\" Ansaldo.\r\n\r\nMarina giggled.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find out?\" Ansaldo asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, _ilustre_. What was it like to examine Tovarich Tabio?\"\r\n\r\nAnsaldo laughed. \"Let me take care of the Tovarich, please. And don't\r\nact too happy at the Embassy tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a fool, _ilustre_. Didn't the Caudillo himself personally\r\ndecorate me for bravery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you are being a boor. I detest boors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, _ilustre_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try to find out if they are coming in tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would not be coming by Clipper,\" Marina said. \"Too dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the rustle of paper, followed by the padded footsteps. Then\r\nsomeone--Hall guessed it was Marina--sat down in a creaky armchair. The\r\nman with the shoes got up and walked in the direction opposite from\r\nHall's room. Hall heard a door open, followed a few seconds later by the\r\nrush of water into a tub. He remained in his chair, his stethoscope\r\nstill against the plaster.\r\n\r\nThe phone near Hall's bed started to ring. He got up very quietly,\r\ntiptoed over to the bed. He hid the stethoscope under his pillow before\r\nhe answered.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, it's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, Jerry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak louder. I can't hear you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\" He went on speaking with his hand around the mouthpiece to\r\nmuffle the sound. \"Can you hear me now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about. Listen, I've got lots to tell you. I was with Doctor when\r\nhe examined the President, and he was magnificent!\"\r\n\r\n\"The patient?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you dope. The doctor. What are you doing now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Getting dressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too. Buy me a drink and I'll tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now?\"\r\n\r\nJerry laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said. \"You're not wearing a thing at the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a second. There. Now you're right about one thing, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tempt me,\" he warned. \"I might decide to check up for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now you won't! Meet you downstairs in about twenty minutes. O.K.?\"\r\n\r\nHall finished his shave and dressed, toying all the while with the\r\nnotion of walking down the corridor to Jerry's room before she had a\r\nchance to leave. Pepe would heartily approve, he thought, and, besides,\r\nsince that hour in the woods on top of Monte Azul, Jerry had not exactly\r\nindicated that he would be unwelcome if he made a try. But while he\r\nspeculated, Jerry phoned him again from downstairs. \"Daydreaming?\" she\r\nasked, and he answered, \"Yes, about you.\"\r\n\r\nShe met him at the elevator in the lobby. \"Come on,\" she laughed, \"let's\r\ngo to that place in back of the Cathedral. The little Dutch drip was\r\naround here a second ago. He wants to tell you the story of his life, he\r\ntold me.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K. Let's just keep walking.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm as they left the hotel. \"Miss me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a liar.\"\r\n\r\nHall winced. \"Is that the best you have to say? How about the\r\nmagnificent doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's really good, Matt. I'm not kidding. I've worked with some corking\r\nmedics in my day, but this guy is tops.\" She told Hall about the\r\nmasterly way in which Ansaldo had taken command of the situation,\r\nkicking all the San Hermano doctors out of the sick room and examining\r\nTabio only in the presence of Marina, Jerry and Tabio's son.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ansaldo has an idea. But he has to make certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it look like to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be many things. What's good to drink here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything. Scotch and soda?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oke. But really, Matt, you should have seen Doctor in that sick room.\"\r\nShe launched into a long and enthusiastic account of the doctor at work.\r\n\r\nThe girl was on the point of repeating herself when Hall cut her short.\r\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"Let me tell you something about Anibal Tabio and his\r\ngeneration of young democrats who walked out of jail and started to make\r\nhistory.\" He told her of the schools and the hospitals which had been\r\nbuilt in the country in the last decade, of the minimum-wage laws, of\r\nthe work of Tabio followers like Dr. Gonzales.\r\n\r\nHe told her how he first met Tabio in Geneva. \"His was supposed to be\r\njust a small voice in the League; a little South American dressing to\r\nmake the whole show look good. But a month after he got there, Mussolini\r\nstarted to pop his goo-goo eyes at Ethiopia. Hoare and Laval and Halifax\r\nwere so nice and ready to give the Italian steamroller a healthy shove\r\ndownhill to Addis Ababa. Then one afternoon Litvinov got up to fire some\r\nheavy shots. But that was expected. Then del Vayo started, and the fun\r\nbegan. Because, when Vayo was through, it was Tabio's turn. And lady,\r\nwhat Anibal Tabio did to hot shots like Hoare and Laval without even\r\nraising his voice was just plain murder.\"\r\n\r\nJerry put her hand on Hall's arm. \"I suppose I read about it in the\r\npapers at the time. It didn't mean much to me then. I'm afraid it didn't\r\nmean much to me until right now, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you interested in what happened in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not too much, I'm afraid. I was interested in myself. I was making up\r\nmy mind to go to Reno, and then I sat in Reno for six weeks cramming on\r\nmy old school books, and then I was off to nursing school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't Ethiopia, and later Spain, make any impression upon you?\" Hall's\r\nquestion was very gently stated.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it did, Matt. I was sorry for the Africans and I was sorry\r\nfor the Spaniards. I wanted Mussolini to get licked and I wanted the\r\nLoyalists to win. But most of all I wanted to get through nursing school\r\nand then earn enough money to study medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words, if Geraldine Olmstead got her M.D., all would be right\r\nwith the world, eh?\"\r\n\r\nShe avoided his eyes. \"It sounds stupid and mean,\" she said. \"But I\r\nguess I deserve it. I'm afraid that was the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did the idea die?\"\r\n\r\n\"About ten seconds ago, when you put it into words,\" she admitted. \"I\r\nnever thought of it in that way before. But I wasn't the only one,\r\nMatt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no! You were in a majority when the war started. The whole\r\ncountry was sitting back and, as it thought, minding its own business.\r\nWe thought we were wonderfully immune until the bombs began to drop on\r\nPearl Harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're being gallant,\" she laughed. \"There were plenty of people in\r\nthe country like--like you, Matt. Have we time for another drink?\"\r\n\r\nHall was staring into space. Suddenly he exploded. \"_Madre de Dios!_ Now\r\nI remember!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember what? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\" Hall tapped his head. \"In here.\"\r\n\r\nJerry laughed. \"I wish someone would come along and tell me what this is\r\nall about.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time. Let's get back to the hotel. I've got to change\r\nclothes and there's a guy I want to see before I go to the party.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you later.\"\r\n\r\nWalking back to the hotel, he asked Jerry if she had ever found the\r\nsolution to a problem in a dream. \"Because just now I did. Do you\r\nremember when you woke me up this morning that I sounded like a guy in a\r\nfog? Well, I was. But just a few minutes ago at that table on the\r\nsidewalk, the fog lifted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now you feel better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. It's all over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you're lying. I think that whatever it is, it's just\r\nbeginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It's over.\"\r\n\r\nJerry was right. But what she did not know was that the fog had lifted\r\non Dr. Varela Ansaldo. The doctor was the Spanish officer of Hall's\r\ndream, the one at whose back Hall hurled the knife. And at the table,\r\nsipping his second drink, Hall had recalled in a flash where he had seen\r\nVarela Ansaldo before. It had happened in Burgos, in April of 1938,\r\nduring a review of the 12th Division of the fascist army. Ansaldo,\r\nwearing the uniform of a Franco major, with a big Falange yoke and\r\narrows sewn over the left breast pocket, had shared a bench on the\r\nreviewing stand with an Italian and a German officer. Directly behind\r\nthem, on that day, had flown the flags of Imperial Spain, The Falange,\r\nNazi Germany and fascist Italy. Hall remembered the tableau vividly,\r\nremembered so clearly perhaps because while watching the review from the\r\nsidewalk he had been annoyed by the staff photographer of Franco's\r\n_Arriba_, who must have shot a hundred pictures of the officials in the\r\nstands that day and who had also shoved Hall aside or stepped on his\r\ntoes before shooting each picture.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you at the Embassy tonight,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oke. But get that scowl off your face first,\" she smiled. \"You promised\r\nto be nice tonight, and right now you look as if you are planning to\r\nkill someone with your bare hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter six_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Embassy was three blocks beyond the Presidencia. Hall\r\nwanted to walk to the party, but when he reached the street he became\r\nself-conscious about his palm-beach tuxedo jacket, and he hailed a\r\nstrange cab.\r\n\r\nThe Embassy was housed in an old Spanish palace which a former\r\nAmbassador had left to the United States Government in his will. After\r\nthe first World War, when the government had taken title to the palace,\r\nWashington sent an architect and an office efficiency man to San Hermano\r\nto redesign the structure. The outside remained more or less intact. But\r\ninside, many changes had been effected. The spacious street floor,\r\ndesigned as the slave quarters in the seventeenth century and later\r\nconverted to storerooms and servants' quarters, was now a hive of\r\noffices and waiting rooms. The second floor was devoted largely to a\r\ntremendous ballroom, a state dining room, and the tapestried private\r\noffices of the Ambassador himself. The living quarters of the Ambassador\r\ntook up the third floor, while the low-ceilinged fourth floor,\r\noriginally designed for soldiers, was now given over to servants' rooms.\r\n\r\nA secretary at the entrance checked Hall's name off against a list on a\r\nteak table. He took the carpeted stairs to the ballroom. Two butlers\r\nstood at a screen in the doorway to the big room. The first butler\r\nannounced his name, but not loud enough to disturb any of the\r\nAmbassador's two hundred-odd guests. The second butler nodded to Hall,\r\nand led the way through a maze of dignitaries, diplomats' wives, and\r\nyoung people trying to dance to the music a rumba band was producing\r\nfrom a bandstand in a corner. Hall followed him patiently, looking for a\r\nsign of Jerry's red hair. The butler nodded gravely at a young girl\r\ndancing with a thin Latin in tails. She left her dancing partner and\r\nadvanced on Hall with an outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Matthew Hall, Miss Margaret,\" the butler whispered.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you came, Mr. Hall. I'm Margaret Skidmore.\" Her hand, thin\r\nand remarkably strong, was covered with a white net glove that reached\r\nto her elbow.\r\n\r\n\"It's nice of you to have me,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nMargaret Skidmore took his arm. \"We must get you a drink,\" she said,\r\n\"and introduce you to some of the more interesting people here. And oh,\r\nyes, to my father. But I warn you, he's not in the first category.\" She\r\nwas short; much smaller than Jerry, Hall thought, but a bird of a\r\ndifferent color. As they crossed the room, a wisp of the black hair\r\npiled on top of her head dropped over her eye. Hall was amused by the\r\nway she blew the hair to one side twice before deciding to lift it with\r\nher gloved hand.\r\n\r\n\"This is my Dad's favorite punch,\" she said at the buffet table. \"I\r\nforgot to tell you that the party is to celebrate the third anniversary\r\nof his mission.\"\r\n\r\nHall ladled out two cups. \"Here's to the next three years,\" he toasted.\r\n\r\n\"The next three years are the ones that will count,\" Margaret Skidmore\r\nsaid. She was smiling at Hall and at some other guests when she said it,\r\nbut it was not polite banter.\r\n\r\n\"The Press Secretary of the Embassy is sore at you,\" she said. \"He's\r\nangry because you tried to get to Gamburdo without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Hall said. \"If you'll introduce me to him, I'll try to make\r\namends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother,\" she laughed. \"Smitty's a stuffed shirt who needs to be\r\ntaken down a peg or two. But I must say that you look a lot different\r\nthan I thought you would, Mr. Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I'm supposed to look like a hero and I have the face of a mugg.\r\nOr a gorilla.\" He was still looking for Jerry. \"You're a surprise, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I so different?\" There was coquettish amusement in her hazel eyes.\r\nShe tilted her fragile doll's nose, forced a haughty cast to her\r\nsmall-girl's face. \"Is an Ambassador's daughter supposed to be a\r\nhigh-and-mighty lady like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I like you better the other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. It's my only way.\"\r\n\r\nHall spotted Jerry on the dance floor with Varela Ansaldo. Jerry looked\r\nvery happy, and Ansaldo had lost some of his undertaker's grimness. He\r\ntried in vain to catch her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes my father.\"\r\n\r\nHall found himself shaking hands with a portly, middle-aged American who\r\nwore tails as if to the manor born. J. Burton Skidmore had the most\r\nimposing head of wavy gray hair in the entire hemisphere, and he knew\r\nit. His face, still ruddy and youngish, was pink and smelled of fine\r\ncologne.\r\n\r\n\"_Con mucho gusto_,\" the Ambassador said, holding Hall's hand and bowing\r\nslightly from the waist.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to meet you, sir,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Father, Mr. Hall is an American. He is Matthew Hall, the writer. You\r\nknow. Matthew Hall.\" The childish, well-bred-daughter smile on Margaret\r\nSkidmore's face could not conceal the acid contempt in her voice. \"Mr.\r\nHall is an American, from New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, oh, yes, indeed. Hall. Of course, Mr. Hall. Been in San\r\nHermano long, Mr. Hall?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Less than a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine place, Mr. Hall. Fine people. Have you met Smitty yet? Dear, have\r\nyou seen Smitty? I think he and Mr.--Mr. Hall could find much in common,\r\nMargaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" Margaret Skidmore said, and the Ambassador helped himself to\r\na cup of punch.\r\n\r\n\"_Amigo Mateo!_\"\r\n\r\nWithout turning around, Hall said, in Spanish, \"Only one man in all the\r\nworld has a scratchy voice like that,\" and then he turned around and\r\nembraced Felipe Duarte.\r\n\r\n\"What brings you to San Hermano?\" he asked Duarte.\r\n\r\n\"I am now a diplomat. First Counselor of the Mexican Embassy in San\r\nHermano and guest professor of literature at the University.\"\r\n\r\nHall and Duarte had last met in Spain, where Duarte had served as a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel with the regular Spanish People's Army. \"_Coronel_\r\nPancho Villa\" was the name his men gave him, and the thin, gangling\r\nMexican scholar had fought like a terror to live up to this name. Of\r\nDuarte, the General Staff officers said that he was as bad a strategist\r\nas he was brave a man, which would have made him one of the worst\r\nstrategists in military history. But during the Ebro retreat, Duarte had\r\ntaught the veteran professional officers a few things about the tactics\r\nof guerrilla warfare which raised his standing as a soldier.\r\n\r\nDuarte took Margaret Skidmore's hand and raised it to his lips.\r\n\"_Enchante_,\" he sighed, and she knew at once that he was laughing at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Senor Ambassador,\" Duarte said, speaking rapid Spanish, \"this is one of\r\nthe most magnificent parties I have ever attended. How do you manage to\r\ngive such splendid parties with only your chit of a daughter to help you\r\nshove food down the ulcerous throats of these sons of whore mothers,\r\ndear Senor Ambassador? It is stupendous. It is colossal.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador smiled, shook Duarte's hand, and bowing slightly, he\r\nmurmured, \"_Con mucho gusto_.\" Then, still smiling, he turned and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let this guy fool you,\" Hall said to the Ambassador's daughter.\r\n\"He speaks English as well as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better,\" Duarte said. \"Ah learned mah English in Texas, Ah'll have\r\nyo'all know, suh. And Mateo, don't let Margaret's innocent smile fool\r\nyou. She knows almost enough Spanish to know what I just told her\r\ndistinguished papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some day I'm going to know enough,\" Margaret laughed. \"And when I do,\r\nyou're going to get your face slapped in front of everyone, I'm afraid.\r\nTell me, Mateo, does _hijos de la gran puta_ mean what I think it does?\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds like slang to me,\" Hall said. \"I learned my Spanish on the\r\nLinguaphone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a fast boy, Matt,\" she said. \"Call me Margaret, if you wish.\"\r\nShe straightened Hall's tie with a perfumed glove. \"I'll give you a\r\nlittle time with Felipe, and then I'll steal you back. There are many\r\npeople here tonight who want to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry back,\" Duarte said. \"He bores me stiff when I have him on my\r\nhands too long.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bastard,\" Hall said. \"You're a diplomat now. Don't you ever stop\r\nclowning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. When I kill fascists I am very serious. You know that, Mateo. But\r\nhere, if I did not clown, I would die of boredom. For example, when\r\nSkidmore gives a party, the politicos in my Embassy, they all find\r\nreasons for being out of town. I am not a politico. I am a professor of\r\nliterature and a killer of fascists, by profession; a diplomat because\r\nsomeone wanted to do Lombardo a favor and at the same time remove my\r\nface from the domestic scene. _Claro?_ So it is clown or die. And if I\r\nmust die, I prefer to die having a second crack at Franco.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Claro, amigo._ But must you wear a suit like this one?\"\r\n\r\nDuarte's evening clothes were his cloak of independence. He wore a cheap\r\ntuxedo he had bought in New York for twenty dollars and a pair of worn\r\npatent-leather shoes that creaked as he walked. On state occasions, he\r\nwore the medals he had earned on the battlefields in Spain. For private\r\nparties, he simply wore an enameled gold Mexican flag on his lapel.\r\nTonight, he wore only the flag.\r\n\r\nAll this he explained to Hall in his gay, rasping Spanish. \"When the\r\nFalangist Embassy was still on good terms, I wore my Republican medals\r\nall the time. But just before Don Anibal took sick, he insulted the\r\nCaudillo in a speech before the University faculty, and when the Franco\r\nAmbassador called to ask for an apology Tabio told him that the truth\r\ncalled for no apologies. So the Caudillo got sore and he called his\r\nAmbassador home. The Embassy is still open, but a clerk is in charge,\r\nand there isn't a Spanish diplomat in San Hermano of high enough\r\nstanding to be invited to any Embassy.\"\r\n\r\nJerry joined them, and when Hall presented her to Duarte, the Mexican\r\nkissed her hand and murmured, \"_Enchante_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Olmstead is Dr. Ansaldo's nurse,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"How very interesting,\" Duarte said. \"May I have this dance with the\r\nnurse of Dr. Ansaldo?\" and before she had a chance to say that her feet\r\nwere killing her, the dexterous Duarte was guiding her through the steps\r\nof an intricate rumba he improvised at that moment.\r\n\r\nHall took another glass of punch. Duarte was his friend, but at the\r\nmoment he wanted to break his neck. He wanted Jerry for himself, and he\r\nhated the idea of admitting or showing it. He watched them so intently\r\nthat he failed to see Margaret return to the punch bowl.\r\n\r\n\"Deserted?\" she asked. \"Our friend Felipe would desert his mother for a\r\nredhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's quite a guy,\" Hall laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" she said. \"There's a crowd that's been dying to meet you. The\r\ncountry's biggest publisher and some of the more important business\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fernandez?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. He publishes _El Imparcial_. Confidentially, his paper is\r\ngetting the Cabot Prize this year. Dad arranged it.\"\r\n\r\nFernandez was standing with a group of three Hermanitos and a blonde\r\nfortyish woman in a tight dress whom Hall recognized instantly as an\r\nAmerican. \"I'm Giselle Prescott,\" she said, her smile revealing flecks\r\nof lipstick on her yellow teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of the amenities, will you, Gis?\" Margaret Skidmore said.\r\n\"Dad is flagging me over at the other end.\" She picked up her skirts,\r\nhurried to her father's rescue.\r\n\r\nGiselle Prescott introduced Hall to Jose Fernandez, tall, handsome, in\r\nhis early fifties. Fernandez presented him to Segundo Vardieno,\r\nFrancisco Davila, and Alfonso Quinones. Davila was a man of one age and\r\nbuild with Fernandez, the other two were shorter and about ten years\r\nyounger. Breathlessly, Giselle Prescott told Hall that Vardieno and\r\nQuinones were among the ten largest landowners in the nation, and Davila\r\nits leading attorney. They all made modest denials.\r\n\r\nQuinones asked Giselle to dance, and she accepted gladly. Her myriad\r\nblonde ringlets neatly blocked her partner's forward view.\r\n\r\n\"Very accomplished writer,\" Hall said. \"In the popular magazine field,\r\nMiss Prescott is supreme.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is very able,\" Davila said. Like Quinones and Vardieno, he wore the\r\nemblem of the Cross and the Sword in his lapel. Fernandez wore only the\r\nribbon of the French Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n\"My niece told me that you had some difficulties at the Press Bureau\r\ntoday,\" Vardieno said.\r\n\r\n\"Your niece?\" Then he remembered the golden Cross and Sword dangling\r\nfrom the thin golden chain. \"Oh, yes, the young lady who speaks English\r\nso well.\"\r\n\r\nVardieno explained to Fernandez that Hall had been unable to arrange for\r\nan interview with Gamburdo. \"Don't you think you could help Senor Hall?\"\r\nDavila asked, and Fernandez assured the three men that the matter would\r\nbe taken care of in the morning. Of course, it might not be possible\r\nuntil after the Congress convened, but then politics in San Hermano\r\nbeing what they were, the illustrious colleague from North America would\r\nsurely be understanding.\r\n\r\n\"What's the inside on the political picture?\" Hall asked, and the three\r\nmen, talking in unison and talking singly gave him one picture.\r\n\r\nTheir picture was very detailed. \"El Tovarich--our Red President, you\r\nknow,\" had lined up the unruly elements behind a dangerous program of\r\nconfiscating the estates of their rightful owners and turning them over\r\nto communist gunmen. In addition to this land-piracy scheme, Tabio also\r\nintended to drive the Catholic Church underground and impose heavy\r\npenalty taxes on the parents who sent their children to Catholic\r\nparochial schools. To aid in this program, Tabio was throwing open the\r\ngates of the nation to Red agitators disguised as Jewish and Spanish\r\nrefugees.\r\n\r\n\"So it's as bad as that,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Worse.\" Fernandez looked around him. \"Come closer,\" he said. \"There's\r\nsomething I must tell you about your own safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"My safety?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Senor.\" Fernandez had his right hand on Hall's shoulder. \"Late\r\nthis afternoon I received a confidential information that the Communist\r\nParty in San Hermano had privately denounced you to its members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Denounced me? But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Senor. And it was a most dangerous denunciation, too. A prominent\r\ncommunist leader telephoned the editor of the official Red paper and\r\ndenounced you for being an enemy of Tovarich Tabio and a supporter of\r\nSenor Gamburdo.\"\r\n\r\nHall smiled. \"But that couldn't be so bad,\" he demurred. \"The Reds are\r\nalways denouncing someone. Tomorrow the Communist Party paper will\r\nattack me as a fascist, and I guess that will be the end of the whole\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that is not what will happen,\" Segundo Vardieno insisted. \"Tell him\r\nthe rest of the information, Don Jose.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Jose Fernandez looked around to make sure that he was not being\r\noverheard. \"Senor Vardieno is right, my friend. You see,\" he said, \"the\r\nRed who phoned the _Mundo Obrero_ ordered the editor _not_ to print a\r\nword about you--yet. Do you understand what that means?\"\r\n\r\nDavila, the lawyer, explained. \"What Don Jose means,\" he said, \"is that\r\na secret denunciation generally precedes an assassination. You see,\r\nSenor Hall, if the Reds denounce you in their press, you would be marked\r\nbefore the world as an enemy of the Tovarich. Then, if anything happened\r\nto you--they are not only blameless, but even after killing you they can\r\nmake great propaganda about how the alleged fascists killed you because\r\nyou are a noted American patriot who stands for free enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty clever,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Jewish cleverness!\" Segundo Vardieno was shaking with rage. \"Give a Jew\r\na hundred pesos and in a day he has a thousand and you'll never know how\r\nhe did it. But will he apply his cleverness for the good of the country?\r\nNo! Only for communism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Tabio a Jew?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Confidentially,\" Vardieno answered, \"El Tovarich is a Sephardic Jew.\r\nBut we're not making it public because we are gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And only because we are gentlemen,\" Fernandez added. \"I don't think El\r\nTovarich will be among us much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he really that sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Davila said. \"You know what happened to him, don't you? No?\r\nWell, it's almost like the Hand of Divine Retribution.\" He told Hall\r\nthat Tabio had turned over to one of his henchman a vineyard confiscated\r\nfrom an old family, and that in gratitude the henchman had started to\r\ndistill a special brandy for the Tovarich. \"And now, the excess alcohol\r\nfrom too much of the stolen grape has taken its toll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you know!\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"It is the gospel truth,\" Fernandez said. \"I have ways of confirming the\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some mess, isn't it?\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"It is filled with dangers,\" Vardieno said. \"Your calmness is admirable,\r\nSenor Hall, but you had better watch out. The Reds are out to kill you.\"\r\n\r\nHall accepted a cigar from Jose Fernandez, took his time about lighting\r\nit before answering Vardieno. \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, casually.\r\n\"Perhaps you might know that earlier in this war, I was on board a\r\nBritish warship which the Nazis sunk with aerial torpedoes. I not only\r\nsurvived, but I came through without a scratch. Since then I just can't\r\nget too excited about a threat.\" He looked at the three men to see if\r\nhis braggart's act succeeded. Fernandez was obviously the most impressed\r\nof the three.\r\n\r\n\"_Bueno! Muy caballero!_\" Fernandez said. \"But you had better be\r\ncareful. The Reds in San Hermano have none of the sporting codes of the\r\nNazi airman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that you mention it,\" Hall said, \"I did catch some bastard\r\nfollowing me the other day.\"\r\n\r\nIn a small voice, Davila asked, \"Did you get a good look at him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I most certainly did. He was a big, clumsy brute in the white linen\r\nsuit of a respectable business man and a panama hat. But I'll bet a good\r\nbox of Havana cigars that he was a longshoreman or a miner. I know the\r\ntype.\"\r\n\r\nDavila looked at Vardieno and Fernandez. A slow grin crept over the\r\nlawyer's face, and then the other two Hermanitos were grinning too. \"So\r\nthey started, eh?\" he said. \"Well, don't let that big one worry you too\r\nmuch. Should he, Don Jose?\"\r\n\r\nThe publisher grunted. \"No. Don't worry about that one.\" Hall could\r\nsense that Fernandez was picking up his cue from the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Davila said, \"I'll wager that you can find the\r\npicture of the man in the white suit in Don Jose's confidential file on\r\nthe Reds. He keeps it in his office in the _Imparcial_ building.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be honored if you visited me in my office,\" Jose Fernandez said\r\nto Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can make it this week,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Sst,\" Davila warned. \"Miss Prescott is coming back. Let's change the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Vardieno said. \"There is no sense in involving her in\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is quite a turnout,\" Hall was saying when Giselle Prescott and\r\nQuinones rejoined the group. \"I think that every nation is represented\r\nby its Ambassador here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every nation but Spain,\" Quinones said. \"El Tovarich took care of that\r\nby insulting the Ambassador and the Chief of the Spanish State.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" Vardieno said. \"Spain is a good customer for our nation,\r\nbut El Tovarich is so angry at Generalissimo Franco for destroying\r\ncommunism in the Motherland that he is deliberately trying to destroy\r\nthis trade in order to get even with Franco.\"\r\n\r\n\"He not only insulted Spain,\" Quinones said. \"In his speech to the\r\nUniversity, El Tovarich said that only the so-called fascists in San\r\nHermano supported Franco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like our pinkos back home,\" Giselle Prescott said to Hall.\r\n\r\nFernandez exploded. \"I am a good Catholic,\" he snapped. \"I am pious.\r\nDuring the Civil War I supported Franco. I was proud to support him. I\r\nnot only supported Franco, but I was delighted to hail Hitler and\r\nMussolini as noble allies in the struggle against Jewish Bolshevism. But\r\nam I a fascist? I defy any man to call me a fascist or a Falangist to my\r\nface!\"\r\n\r\nDavila turned to both Hall and Giselle Prescott. \"Now don't jump to any\r\nfalse conclusions about Don Jose,\" he smiled. \"After all, you Americans\r\nare not Reds because you welcome the godless Russian armies of Stalin as\r\nyour allies in this present war, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bull's-eye!\" Giselle Prescott laughed. \"I'm delighted to hear you both\r\ntalk like this. Back home only the Reds and the pinkos were for the\r\nso-called Spanish Loyalists during the war.\" She opened her tiny purse\r\nand found a leather address book. \"Gimme a pencil or a pen, will you,\r\nHall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to put down what Senor Fernandez and Senor Davila just said\r\nbefore I forget. I'm doing a piece for a mag and these quotes would just\r\nfit in. May I quote you, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to conceal,\" Fernandez said proudly.\r\n\r\nDavila was very gracious. \"Of course you may use these remarks. But\r\nplease don't use Don Jose's name in your article. It might be\r\nmisunderstood. You see, Don Jose has many enemies in the Jewish and\r\nradical press in your country.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my honor as a Girl Scout,\" she said, \"I'll use the quotes but not\r\nthe names.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got quite a story there,\" Hall said. He was looking into the mob\r\non the dance floor for a sign of Jerry. Her red hair was not to be\r\nfound, but Margaret Skidmore, dancing with a bemedaled diplomat, caught\r\nhis eye and gestured that she would join him at the end of that dance.\r\nShe took him away from the group in a few minutes and led him toward the\r\nAmerican bar she had rigged up for the party.\r\n\r\n\"They sure were talking at you for a while,\" she said. \"I could see them\r\ngiving it to you with both barrels.\"\r\n\r\n\"That they were. What is the lowdown, anyway? Are those boys completely\r\nright about Tabio?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was amused. \"Oh, they're a gang of hotheads, I warn you. But\r\nnice. I suspect that our friend Giselle is going to find Don Jose\r\nparticularly nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meow!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a cat. I just know Giselle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's talk about San Hermano politics. I think you know plenty in that\r\nlittle head of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do. But tonight's a party. I've got to be Daddy's good little\r\nHostess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bores me silly,\" Margaret said.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we can talk some other time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow would be swell. I have to go to my place in Juarez early in\r\nthe morning. Why don't you come out for lunch? It's a two-hour ride by\r\ntrain from San Hermano. I think you can make a train at eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow?\" Hall hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd make it,\" the girl said with a sudden intensity.\r\n\r\n\"It's a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll meet you at the station.\"\r\n\r\nThey joined her father and one of the Embassy secretaries at the bar.\r\nHall had a Cuba Libre, and was introduced to a South American painter.\r\nHe listened to the painter talk to the Ambassador about the beauties of\r\nArizona, watched J. Burton Skidmore gravely shake hands with the painter\r\nand mutter, \"_Con mucho gusto_.\" Then the painter asked Margaret to\r\ndance and, when she left, Hall wandered off to look for Jerry.\r\n\r\nHe found her at the punch bowl with Ansaldo. \"May I ask Miss Olmstead\r\nfor this dance?\" he asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Just this one dance,\" Jerry said, \"I'll be right back.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her cheek against his, softly hummed the tune the band was\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\n\"It's nice to have you in my arms,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's nice to be in your arms.\"\r\n\r\nHe held her closer. They danced well together. So well that when Jerry\r\nsaid it would be better if they did not dance again that night, Hall\r\nmade up his mind to leave at once. \"I can't hang around and watch you\r\ndancing with Ansaldo all night,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Massa Hall,\" she said, \"Ah swain Ah do believe you-all are\r\njealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Duarte give you English lessons in one rumba, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a goof,\" she laughed.\r\n\r\nHe took her back to Ansaldo, paid his respects to the Ambassador, and\r\nlooked for Duarte. The Mexican was talking to the tall young wife of the\r\nVichy Ambassador.\r\n\r\n\"Felipe,\" Hall tugged at Duarte's sleeve, \"I am afraid that I must go\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you, if you're alone. Madame, _enchante_ ...\" He winked at\r\nHall as he kissed Madame la Comtesse's hand. \"Now we must pay our\r\nrespects to our host.\"\r\n\r\n\"I already have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me while I do. I never miss it. He has kept me from\r\nsquandering my money. I bet with myself on him, and I always lose. So\r\nFelipe pays Duarte, and Duarte supports Felipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are you babbling about now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Ambassador. He is an original, Mateo. For three years he draws me\r\nto his parties as a lodestone draws baser metals. In three years, he has\r\nlearned exactly three words of Spanish: _'Con mucho gusto_.' Of course\r\nhe still says them with a gringo accent, but anyone can recognize what\r\nhe means.\r\n\r\n\"For three years I am waiting for him to learn a new word, any word.\r\n_Si. No. Pan. Mantequilla._ Right now, I'd settle for just one new\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning, when I was green in the business of diplomacy, I was\r\nyounger and more optimistic. Then I would not have settled for a word. I\r\nwanted a whole new phrase. Nothing complicated, you understand. Any\r\nsimple phrase would have satisfied me. _Tiene usted un fosforo?_ Or\r\neven--_Donde esta la sala de caballeros?_ But no. Tennyson's brook\r\nburbles forever, and unto eternity J. Burton Skidmore will not learn\r\nmore than his three words, and damn it, he won't even learn how to speak\r\nthem correctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're still betting on him?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do?\" Duarte said. \"We stupid Mexican peons have such a deep\r\nfaith in mankind that we are always betrayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here comes the Ambassador now.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oiga!_\" Duarte stopped Skidmore, took his hand, and let loose a stream\r\nof Mexican obscenities, spoken in dulcet, smiling tones. When he paused\r\nfor breath, Skidmore smiled genially, bowed slightly from the hips, and\r\nsaid, \"_Con mucho gusto_.\"\r\n\r\nHall nearly collapsed with laughter when he and Duarte reached the\r\nstreet. \"You bastard,\" he said, \"you'll kill me before my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a drink before you die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. But let's run over to the Bolivar first. I want to see if there's\r\na message. Besides, we could stand some fresh air.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte agreed. \"I saw Fernandez and Vardieno trying to gas you,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You could use some air.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not kidding, Felipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you like the Falange in San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Fernandez and his friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. That Pepito Fernandez, there is an _hijo de la chingada_ for\r\nyou, Mateo. Once, when he was keeping a woman in Paris ...\" and Duarte\r\nwas off on a long hilarious story about the publisher and his lady of\r\nthe hour. He was still telling the story when they reached the darkened\r\nPlaza de la Republica and Hall suggested that they cut across the\r\ncobbles rather than walk two-thirds of the way around the square.\r\n\r\nHall stepped off the sidewalk and took three steps before he noticed the\r\nlarge Rolls-Royce bearing down on them with her throttle wide open and\r\nher lights off. \"Jump!\" he shouted, but Duarte, who saw it first, had\r\nalready yanked Hall back to the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Get behind this pillar, quick!\" Duarte had a small pistol in his hand.\r\nHe stood watching the Rolls roar across the Plaza and disappear into the\r\nalley leading to the Avenida de la Liberacion.\r\n\r\n\"It's almost like old times,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"He tried to kill you, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better put your gun away. And we'll have that drink first, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to phone for a car from the Mexican Embassy from the next\r\nphone, _chico_. Those bastards weren't playing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put the gun away. It was a bluff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you expected it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no! I didn't think it would take so soon. But they had no\r\nintention of killing me tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Arrows?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte put the gun in his pocket. \"I don't understand. It seems a little\r\ntoo subtle for the Falange. Are you working for your government now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They turned me down. They said I was pro-Loyalist during the war.\r\nRight now that makes you a Red in Washington. I'm traveling on my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your own?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm well-heeled. My last book sold like hell. So now I'm young Don\r\nQuixote.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your Sancho Panza?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none. Or rather, I have thousands of them. Exiles. Taxi drivers.\r\nUnion leaders. Communists. First Secretaries of Mexican Embassies.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you after?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Falange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I can help you, _chico_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to. Wait, I'm going into the hotel for a minute. Come on\r\nalong. I'll only be a second.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte took a seat in the lobby while Hall talked to Souza. There was\r\nstill no letter from Havana, but Souza had some information about the\r\nRenault Androtten had used. \"It is a for-hire car owned by the Phoenix\r\nGarage on Reyes Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you find out who hired it the other night?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will not be so easy, _Companero_ Hall. The mechanics in the\r\nPhoenix are not union members. But we are trying to reach someone there.\r\nPerhaps by tomorrow we will know.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something else you can find out. Perhaps from the Mechanics\r\nUnion. Find out how many Rolls-Royce roadsters there are in San Hermano.\r\nI know it will be hard, but it's important.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try. Must you know soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very soon, Fernando. A Rolls-Royce roadster, it was painted black or\r\ndark blue, I think, and just tried to run down Duarte and me in the\r\nPlaza.\"\r\n\r\nSouza made some notes on a slip of paper. \"Maybe we can find out\r\ntonight,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good. I'll be back in an hour. Is Androtten in his room?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He's been out all evening.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte knew a quiet little bar a few blocks from the Bolivar. \"They call\r\nit a lover's retreat,\" he said when they got there. \"You can see why.\"\r\nMost of the tables were surrounded with lattice walls, and those tables\r\nwhich were occupied were monopolized by couples who looked into one\r\nanother's eyes and said little.\r\n\r\n\"There's Ansaldo's _maricon_,\" Duarte laughed. \"In the table at the\r\nback. I know the boy who's with him, too. He's a blue blood from the\r\nVichy Embassy.\"\r\n\r\nHall watched Marina and the French boy. They had pink drinks made with\r\ngin and grenadine and raw eggs. The French boy was giggling. \"The\r\nbastards,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Sit here and order a Cuba Libre for me,\" Duarte said. \"I'm going to\r\nphone for a car.\"\r\n\r\nNow that the action had begun, Hall felt better. The tension had been\r\nbroken. Hands were starting to be shown. Now the moves would come more\r\nquickly, he thought, and they would be more definite in form. Diverse\r\nfacts would synthesize, and when the letter came from Havana, perhaps\r\nthe whole thing would start to form one pattern.\r\n\r\n\"We can't talk here,\" Duarte said. \"Let's have a drink and then, when my\r\ncar comes, we'll go to my house. I rented a place on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, boy. That's out tonight. Have to stick around the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we should talk, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have breakfast with you at your house. Do you eat in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes. We'll eat in tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight o'clock too early?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'll get you out of bed, Felipe. Well, here's to Mexico!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter seven_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not quite six when the phone next to Hall's bed rang and a tired\r\nSouza said, \"Your driver is on the way up to your room, Senor.\"\r\n\r\nHall admitted Pepe a moment later. \"What is it?\" he asked. Unshaven,\r\nheavy-eyed, the big Asturiano seemed thoroughly upset.\r\n\r\n\"_Nada_,\" he said. \"It is just time.\" He went to the window, locked the\r\nshutters, and held his finger to his lips. With his other hand, he first\r\npointed to Ansaldo's room and then to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Hall said, raising his voice. \"Thank you for waking me. Sit down\r\nand have a smoke while I dress.\" He gave Pepe a pencil and a sheet of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nPepe wrote: \"The Englishman Fielding was killed three hours ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\nThe driver vigorously pointed to the street. \"You will miss your train,\r\nSenor,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll hurry.\" Hall dressed quickly, shaved, and went downstairs with\r\nPepe. They got into the car and Pepe headed in the direction of the\r\nrailroad terminal.\r\n\r\n\"Fielding was run down by an automobile near his house,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"Was it a Rolls-Royce?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. There was only one witness. An old woman. She said that\r\nhe was walking across the street and the automobile just hit him and\r\nkept on going. She said it looked as if he walked into the car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the old woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"A farmer's wife. She was on her way to the market with a wagon of\r\nmeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't she describe the car?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, Mateo. The Englishman died instantly. He had a gun in\r\nhis pocket when they found him. Didn't have a chance to use it against\r\nhis murderers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No place. I just pointed our noses toward the railroad for the benefit\r\nof anyone watching us from the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. I have an appointment at the beach at eight o'clock. Let's have\r\nsome coffee until we're ready to go.\"\r\n\r\nPepe drove to a cafe near the Transport Union building. They found a\r\ntable in the back of the place. \"Do you know any of the Englishman's\r\nfriends?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not many.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know his friend Harrington?\"\r\n\r\nThe name left Pepe cold. He was certain that he had never met Harrington\r\nor heard the name mentioned. Nor did he know anything about Fielding's\r\nemployees. \"His secretary is a middle-aged Hermanita. She lives alone\r\nwith a parrot and minds her own business. I knew a man who was her lover\r\nonce, but that was fifteen years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know much about Felipe Duarte?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm to meet him at eight this morning.\"\r\n\r\nPepe looked at the clock. \"Then let's go,\" he said. \"Sometimes Duarte is\r\nlike a crazy man, but he is a good friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have met many times. Did you know him in Spain?\"\r\n\r\nThey went to the car, and Hall told Pepe about some of Duarte's\r\nlegendary feats in the war against the fascists. He was in the midst of\r\na story about the Ebro retreat when they reached Duarte's cottage.\r\n\r\nDuarte came to the door wearing a towel around his middle. \"So you got\r\nup?\" he laughed. \"And you got Pepe up, too! Come in and fill your guts.\"\r\nHe led them through the small living room, put on a pair of shorts and\r\nmismated huaraches.\r\n\r\n\"We'll all eat in the kitchen,\" he said. \"I'll bet you forgot that I'm a\r\nwonderful cook, Mateo.\" He served a twelve-egg omelet whose pungent\r\nfires brought tears to Hall's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"This is really going to kill me,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"The lousy gringo,\" Duarte said to Pepe. \"He's got a gringo stomach.\"\r\n\r\nPepe defended Hall loyally. After he had his coffee, he rubbed his\r\nbristling beard and asked Duarte if he had a razor that could cut\r\nthrough steel wire. Duarte took him to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\"Shave and bathe while I talk to Mateo,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, Hall asked him if he knew Fielding. \"Sure, I do.\r\nHe's the one English planter in South America who knows that the world\r\nis round.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's dead.\" Hall told Duarte all that he knew about Fielding's death,\r\nand what little he knew about Fielding himself. Duarte listened in\r\nstunned silence.\r\n\r\n\"And you still think that attempt on you last night was a bluff?\" he\r\nasked when Hall was done.\r\n\r\n\"I'm more convinced than ever that it was a bluff. But whoever drove\r\nthat car knew that an hour later Fielding was going to be killed by a\r\ncar. And I'll bet that it was not the same car that made a pass at us\r\nlast night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you're hiding something from me, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell I am. I'm going to tell you everything I know. Just give me a\r\nchance. Do you know Juan Antonio Martinez?\"\r\n\r\n\"The young teacher?\"\r\n\r\nHall told Duarte about Juan Antonio's phone call to _Mundo Obrero_ and\r\nhow it reached the Cross and the Sword in a matter of minutes.\r\n\"Fernandez and his boy friends told me about the phone call at the\r\nEmbassy last night. They warned me that it meant the Reds were going to\r\nprepare an attempt on my life. Now my cue is to run to them for help\r\nbecause of the Rolls-Royce in the Plaza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you go through with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow. But I don't like the idea. They don't act as if they knew\r\nabout my record in Spain. But it's crazy to think they're going to\r\nremain in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing today?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm catching the eleven o'clock train to Juarez. I have an idea I'll\r\ncome back with a pretty good line on the Cross and Sword camarilla.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte laughed. \"I have an idea you'll come back from Juarez with\r\nsomething else,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not today, Felipe. I'd like to, but not today.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a good piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it. I'm after stronger meat today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like that nurse with the red hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm serious, Felipe. And we haven't got much time. Listen, did you ever\r\nhear of a guy named Harrington? Fielding said he was his associate, and\r\nthat he knew a lot about the Falange at the waterfront.\"\r\n\r\nThe name meant nothing to Duarte. \"But then, I didn't know Fielding too\r\nwell. I've only talked to him once; he wanted to find out if I had known\r\nhis son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got to find Harrington, if he exists,\" Hall said. \"And one\r\nother thing: Fielding had dinner with the new British Naval Intelligence\r\nofficer for this port the night before last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander New?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the guy. You've got to see New this morning. Better send a\r\nmessenger to the British Embassy with a sealed note. Don't use the\r\nphone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I say in the note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything. The idea is that you've got to stop the British Embassy from\r\nraising a stink about Fielding for at least a week. Let the Falange\r\nthink the British Embassy accepts the police verdict on Fielding's\r\ndeath. In the paper this morning the police described it as an\r\nunfortunate accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some accident!\"\r\n\r\n\"Act as if you know plenty when you see New. You'd better have him visit\r\nyou, Felipe. Tell him that in a week you'll have the true facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Well, tell him you think you'll have the full facts. And\r\nfind out all you can about Harrington, if New knows anything. See if you\r\ncan arrange for me to meet Harrington.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\" Duarte looked at his watch and shouted to Pepe to get\r\nout of the bathroom. \"We've got to get started,\" he said to Hall. \"If\r\nI'm to stop Commander New, I'd better not lose any more time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Where will you be tonight at about nine? That's when the return\r\ntrain gets in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me right here. What name will you use? Pedro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pedro is O.K.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we have to meet tonight, I'll tell Pepe where we can do it. I'd\r\nbetter tell him now. Have some more coffee while I dress, _chico_. And\r\ndon't worry.\" Duarte went upstairs.\r\n\r\nHall endorsed a hundred-dollar money order and ran after Duarte. \"One\r\nother favor, Felipe. Ride to town with Pepe and me, and after I get out\r\nat the railroad station, please force that Asturian mule to accept this\r\ncheck. He's refused to take a cent from me since I'm in town--and I\r\nfound out how much gasoline is selling for in San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe train to Juarez was on the line to the north which had been built in\r\nSegura's time. The graft which had gone in to the building of the road\r\nwas now scattered over the far corners of the earth. Somewhere in Paris,\r\none of the chief contractors still lived on his share of the booty,\r\npaying varying fees to the Nazis for butter and woolens. In New York,\r\none of Segura's army of illegitimate sons was studying medicine on the\r\nproceeds of some shares in the line which had belonged to his mother.\r\nEstates whose rolling lands touched the rails on either side belonged to\r\nold Seguristas who had bought the lands with the money they had managed\r\nto steal from the project. The money was gone, but the steel cars the\r\nbuilders had bought in Indiana and Pennsylvania remained. It was still a\r\ngood railroad, and even though it now belonged to the government, the\r\ntrains not only ran on time but were much cleaner and charged lower\r\nfares than before.\r\n\r\nHall watched the green countryside until the rolling landscape and the\r\nrhythm of the wheels made him drowsy. He turned away from the window,\r\nopened his newspaper to stay awake. The news was vague. The bulletin\r\nfrom the Presidencia stated simply that Ansaldo had spent four hours\r\nwith Tabio but had issued no verdict. Those were exactly the words, \"no\r\nverdict,\" and reading them again Hall grew angry. He tried to figure out\r\nsome foolproof way of cabling to Havana, but the censorship hazards were\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\nThe inside pages had little of interest. Bits of international and\r\nWashington news. A feature story from Mexico City on the great religious\r\nrevival that was sweeping Mexico and threatening the Marxist forces in\r\nthe government. This was in _El Imparcial_, and Hall recognized the\r\nbyline of the author, a prominent lieutenant of the Mexican fascist\r\nleader, Gomez Morin. There was a full page of local society items, dry\r\nstuff about weddings, dinners, parties, the goings and comings of the\r\nsmart set. And the inevitable puff story, this one about the \"great and\r\nnoted lawyer\" Benito Sanchez, about whom no one had ever heard a thing\r\nand who would sink back into obscurity until he paid for another\r\npersonality feature at so much per column, cash on the barrel. Hall\r\nforced himself through this flowery account of the lawyer's ancestry,\r\nwit, humanitarianism, piety, fertility, education, patriotism, skill in\r\ncourt, and kindness to his mother. Try as he could, the hack who wrote\r\nthis story had not been able to completely fill three columns, the\r\naccepted length for such compositions. The bottom of the third column\r\nhad therefore been filled with a stock item in small type: \"Ships\r\nArriving and Leaving Today and Tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nMechanically, Hall read the shipping notes. The _Drottning-holm_ was in\r\nport. The _Estrella de Santiago_ was returning to Havana. Tomorrow, the\r\n_Marques de Avillar_ was due from Barcelona. Tomorrow the _Ouro Preto_\r\nwas sailing back to Lisbon. The _City of Seattle_ was now six days\r\noverdue; U. S. Lines, Inc., had no explanation. Mails for the _Ouro\r\nPreto_ closed at midnight.\r\n\r\nHall turned the page and stopped. The rustle of the paper struck a\r\nhidden chord in his mind. He turned back to the shipping news, read it\r\ncarefully. The _Marques de Avillar_ became as great as the _Normandie_\r\nand the _Queen Mary_ rolled into one. He recalled the conversation he\r\nhad overheard between Ansaldo and Marina. _Find out if they came\r\ntoday.... Too dangerous to come by Clipper._ But by Spanish boat?\r\n\r\nHe went back to the conversation. Yes, that was exactly the way they\r\ntalked. And after the talking came the rustling of a paper. Not\r\nevidence, of course, and even in wartime you couldn't shoot two bastards\r\nlike them unless you knew more. But was it worth following up? Perhaps\r\nMargaret Skidmore would be able to supply another piece of the jigsaw.\r\nShe had a sharp tongue, and this meant a sharp head. Sharp and tough,\r\nand Felipe was probably right about her other value, but if it happened\r\nat all it would have to happen when this mess was cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe train pulled into Juarez on time. Hall got off and gaped at the\r\nstation. It was covered from ground to roof with the blazing \"tiger\r\nvines\" whose orange orchid-shaped flowers were the unofficial flag of\r\nthe country. Margaret was waiting for Hall under the station shed. \"Hi,\"\r\nshe shouted, \"have a nice trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swell. Let me look at you under the sunlight.\" In a tennis eye shade,\r\ngreen sports dress, and rope-soled _zapatos_ she seemed to be more of a\r\nwoman than she was in evening clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do,\" he laughed. \"It's just that evening clothes rarely reveal\r\nmore than the size of a woman's shopping budget.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed easily. \"You mean that you can't tell whether a girl in\r\nan evening gown has knock knees or a wooden leg. I have neither. There's\r\nmy car. That little jalopy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is your place from the station?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"It starts right here.\" Margaret pointed to a green field to the left of\r\nthe road. \"I have four thousand acres between the tracks and the main\r\nhouse, and then there's a lot of scrub forest behind the house that\r\nbelongs to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All yours?\"\r\n\r\nThe car was raising great clouds of dust on the dry dirt road. \"Uh huh.\r\nThe money came from Mother's side of the family. Since she died, I more\r\nor less keep the old man in embassies. She left him only cigarette\r\nmoney.\" She was very cold and matter of fact about it.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so shocked. I always talk the way I feel. The old man's a\r\nstuffed shirt and you know it. If he hadn't married money the best he'd\r\nget out of life would be a career as a floor-walker in Macy's. No, he's\r\ntoo aristocratic for Macy's. In Wanamaker's Philadelphia store. Do me a\r\nfavor. There's a big heavy ledger in the side door pocket. Take it out\r\nand put it on my lap. No, with the binding facing the radiator. Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's it for?\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the front ventilator in the cowl. The gush of wind which\r\npoured in lifted her skirt to the edge of the book. \"See?\" she said.\r\n\"Keeps my skirt from blowing over my head when I open the vent.\"\r\n\r\nHall glanced at her bare legs. \"Some day you'll catch cold,\" he smiled.\r\n\"What have you got planted on your land? Looks to me like soy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is soy. Three thousand acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes you a farmer.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell it does. That makes me an Ambassador's daughter. The\r\nRockefeller committee planted it, with local help, of course. It's part\r\nof a demonstration project. The idea is to teach them how to grow new\r\ncrops so that after the war Detroit can keep the home price on soy down\r\nby importing just enough soy to keep it growing in South America. All I\r\ndid was donate my land.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happens to the proceeds when you sell the crop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I suppose the old man will make a big show of donating the proceeds\r\nto the Red Cross in San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my hideaway. The old man can't come out here. He's violently\r\nallergic to soy beans.\"\r\n\r\nShe started to talk about the soy-bean project and the by-products of\r\nits crop. The words flowed without effort. She knew the facts, the\r\ntheories, the statistics, the chemistry of the soy-bean industry as well\r\nas she knew the road to her house. She discussed them as she might\r\nyesterday's weather, or a neighbor's dog. I don't give a damn about soy\r\nbeans, she seemed to be saying, I just know about them because I was\r\nroped in to lend my land and I'll be damned if I'll give my land without\r\nknowing why.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's enough talk about soy, I guess,\" she said when she turned\r\noff the road to the lane leading to her house.\r\n\r\n\"I don't imagine there's anything else to know about it,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, it is a nice house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hollow tile and stucco. I found the plans in an old issue of _House and\r\nGarden_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be damned. It looks as Spanish as the Cathedral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it should,\" Margaret said. \"It's supposed to be an authentic New\r\nMexican ranch house. Let's go in and get a drink.\"\r\n\r\nLike the railroad station, the house was also covered with tiger vines.\r\nIt was built around a flagstone patio. Leaded glass doors opened from\r\nthe patio to the two-story-high beamed living room, the kitchen, and the\r\nback corridor. This corridor opened on both the living room and the\r\nstairs to the upstairs quarters. Inside, the living room was furnished\r\nlike a quality dude ranch--hickory and raw-hide furniture, Mexican\r\n_serapes_ and dress sombreros hanging on the walls and over the large\r\nstone fireplace, a Western plank bar with a battered spittoon at the\r\nrail and a lithograph of the Anheuser-Busch Indians scalping General\r\nCuster. The saloon art classic, of course, hung in a yellow oak frame\r\nbehind the bar.\r\n\r\n\"Holy God,\" Hall said, \"when I was a kid this litho used to give me\r\nnightmares. It used to hang in the dirty window of Holbein's saloon on\r\nWest Third Street in Cleveland--that's my home town--and every time I\r\npassed it I used to see more gore pouring down old Custer's throat.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret took off her eye shade and went behind the bar. \"A drink should\r\ndrive away that terrible memory,\" she said. \"Scotch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Black rum, if you have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming right up. That's a pirate's drink, though. Although when you\r\ncome right down to it, you do look like a freebooter.\"\r\n\r\nHall had his foot on the bar. \"Better smile when you say that, Pard,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe smiled out of the side of her mouth and laughed. \"Here's to Captain\r\nKidd,\" she said, raising her Scotch.\r\n\r\n\"This is good rum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait. I can improve it.\" She reached below the bar for a small wooden\r\nplatter and a lemon. Deftly, she carved off a slice of thick skin,\r\ntwisted it above an empty glass, dropped the peel into the glass and\r\ncovered it with rum. \"Try it this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is good. So you're a bartender, too!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret refilled her own glass and sat down on the edge of a wheeled\r\nsettee. \"Right now I'm farmer, bartender, chambermaid and cook. If you\r\nmust know, outside of the dogs in the yard and the horses in the shed,\r\nwe're the only living things within five miles. All my help is in the\r\nnext town celebrating some saint's day or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll manage to survive,\" Hall smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a pretty self-sufficient lady,\" she said. \"Or hadn't you noticed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could eat. What's cooking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandwiches. Cold beef sandwiches and coffee. And if you're nice you can\r\nhave some _montecado a la_ Skidmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Real ice cream?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But a reasonable facsimile. Let's go to the kitchen. You can help\r\nme carry the tray and stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThey ate at the monastery table in the living room. Margaret told Hall\r\nthe story of how she had supervised the building of the house and then\r\nordered her furniture from a dozen different stores between Houston and\r\nSan Hermano. She spoke of plumbing and artesian wells and wiring systems\r\nwith the same detailed knowledge she had displayed of soy-bean culture.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know San Hermano politics as well as you know soy beans and\r\nhousing?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Better,\" she smiled. \"I'm closer to it. But we've got plenty of time to\r\ntalk about San Hermano. I thought we'd saddle up two horses and go for a\r\nride in the backwoods. Do you ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"After a fashion. I spent a summer vacation as a ranch hand in Wyoming\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret concentrated on Hall's feet for a minute. \"Oh, I can fix you up\r\nwith boots and breeches. You sit here and I'll go on up, change, and\r\nfind you riding things. Just turn on a radio and relax or fix yourself a\r\ndrink while I'm changing.\"\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs to her room. Hall lit his pipe, turned on the radio.\r\nHe found a program of Mexican marimba music.\r\n\r\n\"That's swell,\" Margaret shouted through the open transom of her door.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the water splashing into the bath upstairs. He lay back\r\nand closed his eyes, the radio keeping him awake. In San Hermano, the\r\nannouncer looked at the studio clock, gave the station's call letters,\r\nand read another \"no change\" bulletin on the health of the President.\r\n\r\n\"Matt ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on up to my room. It's the third door to the left of the stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you shut off the radio, too?\"\r\n\r\nHe flipped the radio switch and climbed the stairs to the upper landing.\r\nMargaret's door was slightly ajar. \"That you, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old pirate himself.\" He pushed the door open.\r\n\r\nMargaret was standing near her bed, freshly bathed and completely naked.\r\n\"I changed my mind,\" she said, thickly.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret ...\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Don't talk.\" She had her arms around him, her mouth against his\r\nlips. The pine salts of her bath and the sharp perfume in her hair and\r\nbehind her ears choked in Hall's throat.\r\n\r\n\"You're biting my lips,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe picked her up and carried her to the bed while she undid the buttons\r\nof his shirt with closed eyes and steady fingers. \"I knew you were a\r\npirate,\" she smiled.\r\n\r\nHall kicked his shoes off, drew the blinds.\r\n\r\n\"Are you surprised?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe locked the door and joined Margaret. \"Don't talk,\" he said. \"You kiss\r\ntoo well to talk in bed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the pine scent and the perfume and the savage odor of whisky\r\non hot breath and then there was the faint saline taste of blood on his\r\ntongue and the rigid breasts of the girl pressed against his bare skin\r\nand she was trying to gasp an insane gibberish of love words and sex\r\nwords and sounds that were not words at all. He shut off the gibberish\r\nwith his hard mouth and then he started to lose himself in the devils\r\nthat were coursing through his blood and the sharp pain of her nails\r\ndigging fitfully into the back of his shoulders and the taut smoothness\r\nof her writhing thighs. For a searing moment the emptiness and the\r\nagonies of the past four years rose to the surface like a two-edged\r\nrazor in his brain, rose slashing wildly to torture and torment, and\r\nthen, as suddenly, they were lost in the devils and the blood and the\r\nwhite, pine-scented thighs of the girl and Hall stopped thinking and\r\ngave himself completely to the one, to the only one, to the only thing\r\nthat could answer the devils and the pain and the moment.\r\n\r\nThen she lay at his side, limp, whispering, \"God, oh my God, oh my God,\"\r\nand smiling at him with tear-filled eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Hello.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I good? Was I, Matt?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he realized how adept she actually was at it. Sex was a soy bean,\r\nsomething you used, developed, exploited. \"You're very good at this sort\r\nof thing,\" he said, \"and you know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not always good,\" she said. \"This is one thing that takes two for\r\nperfection. Like now.\" She reached into the drawer of the night table.\r\n\"Cigarette?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Light mine for me, darling. I'm half dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe smoked her cigarette in happy, satisfied silence, moving closer to\r\nHall and putting her free arm under his neck. Then, with an abrupt\r\nmovement, she ground the butt into the ash tray and kissed the scar on\r\nHall's chin. \"Who cut you up?\" she asked. \"Some Frenchwoman's husband?\"\r\nBut before he could answer she was lying on his chest with her open\r\nmouth pressing heavily against his lips.\r\n\r\nThis time he could ignore the devils until the hot furies that\r\ndrove the girl finally moved him to respond. But what had earlier\r\nbeen an experience which reached in and shook the guts was now a\r\nperformance--overture, theme, variations, theme and soaring climax and\r\nmaybe it was what she wanted and maybe it wasn't but baby that's the\r\nbest you get this trip. When it was done she seemed happy enough. She\r\nsmoked another cigarette and then she fell into a light sleep, her head\r\nnuzzling under his arm pit like a puppy's.\r\n\r\nHall lay watching the sun rays as they stretched between the shuttered\r\nwindows and the smoothness of Margaret's glistening back.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" she asked when she awoke.\r\n\r\n\"Really want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh.\"\r\n\r\n\"About a girl from Ohio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Just a girl I know. I've been wondering if she has freckles on her\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, you're frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"When are you going back to San Hermano?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tonight. I'll drive you back. I think we should get ready. The help\r\nmight start straggling back in an hour or so.\" She kissed him tenderly,\r\nthen savagely. \"No, but this is silly,\" she said. \"We'll get caught.\"\r\nShe rolled away and got out of bed.\r\n\r\nLater in the living room, Margaret made two rum drinks. She had changed\r\nher tennis dress for a dark suit, and her fingers now carried three\r\nelaborate rings. \"Now I'm dressed for town again,\" she laughed. \"Without\r\nmy rings I'd feel naked.\" One of them was a wedding ring; Hall asked no\r\nquestions about it.\r\n\r\n\"Are you still interested in San Hermano politics?\" Margaret asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sort of.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything. Fernandez and his friends had one set of ideas. I guess you\r\nknow what they are. The Tabio crowd speaks differently. What's the\r\nlowdown?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret went to the wide window of the room. \"Look,\" she said, \"see all\r\nthat land between the fence and the top of that hill? I've got some of\r\nit in soy and the rest is just lying fallow. What do you think it's\r\nworth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can anyone else. That all depends on the politics down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true back home too, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way, yes.\" She poured another drink for herself and sat down on\r\nthe settee. \"I'll let you in on a secret, Matt. I'll tell you how I came\r\nto buy this place. Sit down. It's a long story. And it leads right into\r\nthe thing you're interested in.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years ago. A young mining engineer in San Hermano met me at a party\r\ngiven at the University. He wanted me to put him in touch with an\r\nAmerican financing outfit. On a field trip he had undertaken as a\r\nstudent, the young engineer inadvertently stumbled across a treasure in\r\nmanganese. The deposits lay in an area he alone could reveal, and for a\r\nconsideration and a share in the profits, he was willing to lead the\r\nright parties to the site of his discovery.\r\n\r\n\"I became the right party,\" Margaret said. \"The soy is growing over a\r\nfortune in manganese.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to the young engineer?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in the States. I got him a scholarship in a good mining school.\r\nWhen he gets out, he'll be able to run the works down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't miss a trick, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she laughed, \"my grandfather didn't come up from a plow on\r\nhis muscles alone. But why don't you ask me why I'm not mining my\r\nmanganese now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that's where the politics comes in,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Now you're catching on. You see, Matt, anyone who didn't know the score\r\ndown here might start mining like mad. There's a war on, the Germans\r\nhave grabbed most of Russia's manganese fields, and Russia had a\r\npractical corner on the world's manganese supply. It's almost worth its\r\nweight in platinum today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why in the hell don't you cash in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I intend to live for a long time after the war, darling. And\r\nI'd like something for my old age. Not inflation-swelled war dollars,\r\nbut real hard money. That's where the politics comes in, Matt. It costs\r\nlike hell to start a mine. I'd have to dip into my reserves to get it\r\nstarted, or get partners and let them pay for the works. But they\r\nwouldn't do it for nothing. They'd wind up with an unhealthy share of\r\nthe profits. This is my baby, and under certain circumstances I can run\r\nit by myself and make money at it. But those circumstances are\r\ndetermined by the politics here.\"\r\n\r\n\"By that,\" Hall said, \"I take it you mean Tabio's politics?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was not smiling now. Her eyes had narrowed down to sharp slits,\r\nand although she talked as fluently about the mine and Tabio as she had\r\nearlier discussed soy beans, her voice had taken on a sharp, metallic\r\nedge. \"I most certainly do,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Then you agree with Fernandez and the Cross and Sword crowd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't tell me,\" she said, wearily, \"that they are all a bunch of\r\ndirty fascists.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not telling you a thing. I'm here to get the lowdown, not to hang\r\nlabels on everyone in San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that,\" she said. \"I can give you the lowdown, if you\r\nreally want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm here for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sick of these smart-aleck pundits who are so quick to hang the\r\nfascist label on everything they don't like,\" Margaret said. \"I'm not\r\nafraid of labels. I'm only interested in the facts. I'm interested in my\r\nmanganese operation. I'm interested in protecting what I have. And I'll\r\nfight against anyone who tries to steal what's rightfully mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been threatened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not directly. That's the hell of it. If not for me, or someone else\r\nwith as much money to risk as I'm risking, this manganese would be\r\nuseless to everyone. But I'm not going to sink a fortune into the mine\r\nonly to have the cream taken away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Tabio?\"\r\n\r\nA slight smile touched Margaret's lips. \"Not exactly,\" she said. \"I'm a\r\nlittle more rational than Fernandez and his friends. It's not Tabio I'm\r\nafraid of, darling. It's the thing he's started. You don't open a few\r\nthousand schools all over a backward country and then expect the people\r\nto remain the same. It's not only the kids who go to these schools;\r\ngrown-ups pack the same school houses every night. People don't want\r\nthings they don't know about. But when they go to school they start\r\nlearning about a million things they'd like to have--and none of these\r\nare free. They begin to want modern houses and radios and refrigerators\r\nand pianos--you have no idea what they begin to want, Matt!\r\n\r\n\"The schools are only the beginning. Once the miners learn how to read\r\nand write, the unions come along and flood them with printed propaganda\r\nabout higher wages. They tell the miners that higher wages mean higher\r\nstandards of living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not for the mine owners, dear,\" she said. \"Higher wages mean lower\r\nprofits. And when you run a mine, the idea is to keep the profits up.\r\nThat's where the politics come in, Matt. You don't pass laws--as the\r\nPopular Front has--forcing employers to bargain with the unions without\r\nmaking the unions so powerful that they can and do elect whole blocs of\r\nunion deputies and senators. And then these blocs push through laws on\r\nhospitalization and social security and death benefits that cut into a\r\nmine owner's profits nearly as much as the wage increases.\r\n\r\n\"In other words, Matt, it all boils down to dollars and cents. Tabio and\r\nhis ideas are great vote-catchers--but the costs are enormous. And these\r\ncosts don't come out of the pockets of the people who vote for the\r\nPopular Front candidates.\"\r\n\r\nHall watched her in fascination as she spoke. This was no mystic Pilar\r\nPrimo de Rivera, he thought, no hyper-thyroid hysteric falling on her\r\nknees in the cathedral and then rushing out with blood in her eyes and\r\nemptying a Mauser full of bullets into the warm bodies of housewives\r\nshopping in the Madrid slums. Margaret's voice had not risen by one\r\nnote. Her hands were calm, she was still relaxed in the settee. If not\r\nfor the hard sharpness of her voice now, she might still be discussing\r\nsoy-bean culture or anything else as remote from her true interests.\r\n\r\n\"Fernandez and the Cross and Sword crowd might be hysterical,\" Margaret\r\nsaid, \"but they are on the right track. The government has to change\r\nquickly, or it will be too late for all of us. The Cross and Sword crowd\r\naren't really natives, you know. They're Spaniards. They got the scare\r\nof their lives when Tabio's Spanish counterparts took over in Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why? They live here. Spain is an ocean away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money has a way of crossing oceans,\" Margaret said. \"They all had\r\nplenty invested in Spain. If Franco hadn't come along, Vardieno and\r\nDavila and Quinones and a lot of other men you haven't met would have\r\nbeen wiped out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Franco a fascist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Labels don't mean a thing. I think democracy is the phoniest label in\r\nthe world, Matt. When it means a stable government, like we used to have\r\nback home before the New Deal, I'm for it. But when it means the first\r\nstep on the road to collectivism, I'll take any Franco who comes along\r\nto put an end to it. That goes for the Cross and Sword crowd, too. Or am\r\nI all wrong?\"\r\n\r\nHall laughed, softly. \"That's a rhetorical question,\" he said. \"Let's\r\nskip the rhetoric. Then things are really bad down here, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"They couldn't be much worse. I know it sounds harsh, but I think the\r\nbest thing Tabio could do for his country would be to die. With Gamburdo\r\nin the Presidencia, you'd see a return to something resembling sanity\r\ndown here. He has a very sound approach.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wouldn't he be too late? What could he do about the school system,\r\nfor instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Cross and Sword crowd want the schools closed down at once. They\r\nwant education returned to the Church. But Gamburdo is a good\r\npolitician,\" Margaret said. \"He'd keep the schools open, but he'll clean\r\nout the Ministry of Education from the very top down to the personnel of\r\nthe village schools. He'll simply turn it over to the Jesuits. They\r\nwon't have to open their own parochial schools; they'll control\r\nTabio's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they enough teachers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo told me that if they need teachers they'll import them from\r\nSpain.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the labor laws?\"\r\n\r\n\"A law is no better than its enforcement. That's what I learned in law\r\nschool and it still goes. Can you imagine what would happen to the\r\nWagner Act if Hoover were back in the White House?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need too much of an imagination to figure that one out,\" Hall\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Margaret said, \"Gamburdo will need more finesse than a\r\nHoover.\" There was the little matter of the arms everyone knew were in\r\nthe hands of the miners in the north. There was also the still painful\r\nmemory of the one-day general strike called by the transport workers and\r\nthe longshoremen when the Supreme Court delayed its decision on the\r\nvalidity of the Tabio labor codes. Gamburdo, she explained, would have\r\nto plan his acts like a military strategist. \"Because unless he does, he\r\nwill need a military strategist to pull him out of the hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean a civil war?\"\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what Margaret did mean. But Gamburdo had a plan for\r\naverting such a war, or, if it had to come, to guarantee the victory for\r\nthe forces of sound government when the issue was drawn. He would begin\r\ngradually by restoring to their army commissions the old officers\r\ntrained in Segura's military college. This he would do before attempting\r\nto circumvent the labor laws. \"Then, when the war ends in Europe, a lot\r\nof good professional military leaders will be out of jobs,\" she said.\r\n\"Gamburdo plans to give them jobs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the troops? Will they be loyal to the new order?\"\r\n\r\nGamburdo had provided for this, too. The army would have the best of\r\neverything; it would be made more attractive than life as a miner or a\r\nsoy-bean cultivator. \"But a boy will have to have the O.K. of his priest\r\nbefore he will be taken in. And what a priest learns at confession is\r\nnothing to be ignored. The Church will keep the unreliable elements out\r\nof the army.\" Once he had an army, Gamburdo would then be ready to\r\nrestore sound government in the nation.\r\n\r\n\"He's a clever guy,\" Hall said. \"I had a hunch he was the coming strong\r\nman on the continent when I applied for an interview.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret thought that this was very funny. \"Don't be a child,\" she\r\nlaughed. \"He won't admit to anything like this for publication.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter. What counts in my business is that I'll be on\r\nrecord as the first American to interview him, and that I'll get the\r\ncredit for discovering him before his name is a household word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now all he'll talk is platitudes. But you might get him to talk\r\noff the record. He's gotten around to telling me things. And stop\r\nlooking at your watch. I'll lock up and we can start back to town at\r\nonce. You'll be back in plenty of time to sleep with her tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"With whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever you have that date with. I know I should be nasty about it. But\r\nI never demanded fidelity and I always hated men who demanded it of me.\r\nThat's the way we both are, darling, and as long as it goes off as good\r\nas it did upstairs today we can expect to do it often.\" She left the\r\nsettee, walked over to Hall's chair, and kissed his ear. He slapped her\r\ntrim buttocks, shouted, \"Cut it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get going,\" she said. \"Time's a-wasting.\"\r\n\r\nHall thought, as Margaret drove him back to San Hermano, that Pepe\r\nDelgado would have approved of her skill as a driver just as much as he\r\nwould disapprove of her politics. The ledger on her lap, she pushed the\r\nroadster through hairpin curves and back-country roads with a confidence\r\nas cold as her reasoning about her manganese properties.\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk to my hotel from the Embassy,\" he said, when they reached the\r\nsuburbs of San Hermano. \"I could stand a little walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're meeting her in the lobby,\" Margaret laughed. She kissed him\r\nfondly when she stopped the car near the Embassy. \"Darling,\" she said,\r\n\"don't ask me to the Bolivar. But I have to go back to the farm in a few\r\ndays. I'll let you know ahead of time, and we can have a night\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me,\" Hall said. \"Or I'll be calling you.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later he met Duarte in the home of one of the secretaries of the\r\nCuban Embassy. The Mexican had borrowed the home for the evening. \"We\r\nhave at least two hours to talk here,\" Duarte told Hall. \"My friend is\r\nat the cinema.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte opened two bottles of cold beer, set one before Hall. He took a\r\nlong look at Hall and burst into laughter. \"Did she give you any\r\ninformation, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bastard,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nFelipe Duarte doubled over with laughter. \"Mateo the Detective!\" he\r\nchortled.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" Hall laughed. \"So I was raped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Raped is the right word, _chico_.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did she take you into her bed, Felipe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Long ago. My first week in San Hermano. Then once more after that. I\r\ngave way for an American aviator who came here to sell planes to the\r\ngovernment. He was succeeded in a week by two men, a local _senorito_\r\nnamed Madariaga and the First Secretary of the French Embassy. After\r\nthat I just stopped noticing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is her husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has no husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was wearing a wedding ring, Felipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a new development. I never heard of her having a ring or a\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a very clever girl, Felipe. And a confirmed fascist.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's only a rich _puta_, Mateo. The hell with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She might be useful, Felipe. What happened to you today? Did you learn\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\nDuarte shrugged his shoulders. He had little real information. \"I saw\r\nCommander New. He looked down his nose at me during our whole interview,\r\nand then, like an English trader, he started to bargain with me. About\r\nthe week, I mean. He said that a week was too long. He would only give\r\nme three days. Then--if I gave him no more information than you got from\r\nthe _puta_ today, he goes to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not so good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? The counsellor of the British Embassy spent the whole day\r\ngoing through Fielding's files with the widow. If they found those\r\nreports you saw that night, maybe the Intelligence officer will give us\r\nthat full week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find out anything about Harrington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander New never heard of him, he says. Then I thought I would make\r\na real surprise for you. Souza arranged with some smart boys to search\r\nAnsaldo's room with a fine comb. But they combed not a louse, Mateo.\r\nThey found nothing of interest except that Ansaldo's _maricon_ is a\r\nmorphine addict.\"\r\n\r\nHall lit a black cigar from the Cuban's private collection. \"Where the\r\nhell is my letter from Havana?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, _chico_.\" Duarte opened a fresh bottle of beer for his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be all right,\" Hall said. \"I won't explode tonight.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte recalled an earlier occasion in a Madrid hospital, when a phone\r\ncall from the Paris office of the AP had made Hall lose his head. \"To my\r\ndying day,\" he told Hall, \"I'll never forget those curses that shot out\r\nof your guts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" Hall said. \"I get sick when I think of it again. That\r\nwas the time they held up my story on Guadalajara because they weren't\r\nsatisfied that I had definite proof that the troops captured by the\r\nRepublic were Italian regulars.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mexican laughed. It was a laugh made bitter by the silver plate in\r\nhis skull. It covered an injury he had suffered in fighting the Italian\r\nregulars at Guadalajara.\r\n\r\nHall understood. \"There are too many bastards in this world,\" he said.\r\n\"I wish curses alone could stop them. But we've got work to do. Pepe\r\ndidn't bring me here. He was busy on something else. I'll have to use\r\nyour driver. Have him drive me to some decent restaurant. I wish you'd\r\ncome along too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me you're hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot. But there's one thing your driver can do for us. Do you know\r\nwhere the Compania Transatlantica Espanola pier is located? Good. Just\r\nhave him drive very slowly past the pier on the way. I want to look it\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter eight_\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after eight in the morning, Hall sat down at a table in a\r\nwaterfront cafe and ordered coffee and rolls. It was a small place with\r\na zinc bar in one corner, patronized largely by longshoremen and petty\r\ncustoms officials. Hall chose a table which gave him a good view of the\r\nCompania Transatlantica Espanola dock diagonally across the street.\r\n\r\nOn the dock there were the unmistakeable signs that the _Marques de\r\nAvillar_ was coming in on time. Minor customs officials in their blue\r\nuniforms stood around in small, important looking knots, their hands\r\nfilled with papers and bundles of official forms. The passenger\r\ngangplank, with the line's name splashed on its canvas sides in crimson\r\nand gold letters, had been hauled on to the pier and lay waiting like a\r\nrigid, outstretched hand for the incoming ship. A row of motley cabs\r\nwere lined up facing the pier, their drivers dozing or reading the\r\nmorning papers behind their wheels as they waited for the business from\r\nthe ship. Pepe was not only one of these drivers, but through the\r\ntransport union he had arranged to fill the cab line with trustworthy\r\nanti-fascist drivers.\r\n\r\nHall could see Pepe slouched behind the wheel of the LaSalle, his white\r\ncap pushed way to the back of his massive head. The cab strategy was\r\nPepe's inspiration. It did away with the necessity of following any of\r\nthe cabs which picked up passengers whose moves might be of interest to\r\nHall. As a further precaution, Souza had arranged through members of his\r\nunion to get an instant line on any of the _Marques de Avillar_\r\npassengers who registered at a San Hermano hotel that day.\r\n\r\nA letter written in Spanish with purple ink in a fine, delicate woman's\r\nhand lay on the metal table between the butter pat and the carafe of\r\nwater. Hall read it again as he stirred his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Beloved Mateo,\" the letter began, and Hall chuckled at Santiago's\r\ncurrent dodge, \"Why did you leave me so suddenly without even giving me\r\na chance to explain? It is you and you alone whom I love, _carino_, and\r\nany thoughts that you have to the contrary you must banish from your\r\ndear head at this instant. Oh, _carino_, since you left without a\r\nfurther word I have had no rest, no peace, no sleep....\" He skimmed\r\nthrough the first two pages of such protestations, then carefully reread\r\nthe casual lines: \"You are so wrong; it is true that I did know the\r\ndoctor before, but he was never my lover. I knew him only because he\r\ntreated dear Carlos, but as a man I hate and detest him. How can I tell\r\nyou again that you are wrong, that he is an abomination not only in my\r\neyes but also in the eyes of my entire beloved family?\"\r\n\r\nNearly three lachrymose pages of love frustrated followed these lines.\r\n\"And so before I close my letter, I must beg you to drop everything if\r\nyou love me and fly back to Havana, even if only for a day. Oh, my\r\nbeloved, if you would only come back to Havana for one day, I am sure\r\nthat I can resolve all the doubts that are in your mind, Mateo. In the\r\nname of all that we have shared, of all that is dear and sacred to us,\r\nplease fly back to my arms, my love, my kisses--and then you will know!\"\r\nThe letter was signed, \"Maria.\"\r\n\r\nHall folded the letter carefully and put it in his wallet. It told him\r\nwhat he wanted to know about Ansaldo. _He treated dear Carlos--he is an\r\nabomination in the eyes of my beloved family._ Santiago's style as a\r\nwriter of love letters might be a little on the turgid side, but he knew\r\nhow to make himself clear. And nothing could be clearer than his line on\r\nAnsaldo. An abomination. A man who marched with the men who put that\r\nfascist bullet through the throat of Uncle Carlos. A bastard.\r\n\r\nThe dock was growing more crowded. Over the near horizon, a ship pointed\r\nits high white face at San Hermano. A long throaty whistle came from its\r\nfront funnel. Then five short blasts, and in a moment the tugs which had\r\nbeen getting up steam in the harbor were heading out toward the growing\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\"The _Marques de Avillar_,\" someone at the bar said. A customs man at a\r\nnear-by table gulped the remainder of his coffee and bolted to the pier.\r\nAt the bar, a laughing longshoreman pushed a five-centavo coin into the\r\nnickeled red juke box, pressed the \"_Besame_\" button. Johnny Rodrigues\r\n_y su_ Whoopee Kids. Two guitars, a cornet, maracas, sticks and a\r\nlugubrious baritone. \"_Besame, besame mucho_ ...\" the raucous blaring of\r\na klaxon at the pier ... \"_la ultima vez_\" ... again the horn drowned\r\nout the words.\r\n\r\nHall looked up at the cabs, ignoring the Whoopee Kids' baritone. A\r\nslender young man in a green jacket and cream-colored slacks was\r\nstanding near the foot of the gangplank. Pepe had taken off his white\r\nhat. Hall kept his eyes glued on Pepe until the man in the green jacket\r\nturned around, revealing himself as Dr. Marina.\r\n\r\nOne of the white sedans of the Ministry of Health pulled up at the pier.\r\nA doctor and two assistants, the three men wearing the light tan uniform\r\nof their service, got out and started to talk to a customs man. He\r\npointed at the white ship being shoved toward the pier by the little\r\ntugs.\r\n\r\nHall drank in the tableau, his eyes following Marina's every move, his\r\nears deaf to the next record being played in the juke box.\r\n\r\n\"_Otro cafe, senor?_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Si, gracias._\"\r\n\r\nBut the fresh pot of hot coffee remained untouched. Hall was still\r\nwatching Marina, but Marina did nothing except shift from foot to foot\r\nwhile he watched the Spanish liner draw nearer the pier with every turn\r\nof the heroic little engines in the two tugs. Hall thought of Jerry. He\r\nhad missed her again last night, but they had a date for dinner at\r\nseven. Doctor had promised her a night off. The messages at the hotel:\r\nJose Fernandez had phoned, wanted Hall to call him back this morning.\r\nO.K., Don Jose, as soon as I get a good look at the rats Marina is\r\nawaiting. I want to hear more about the Red menace hanging over my head.\r\nAnd Souza had an interesting tab on Androtten. The little Dutchman had\r\nstayed out all night. Naughty, naughty, Wilhelm, gadding about with\r\n_putas_ the whole night through and God knows where you are sleeping it\r\noff but I guess your little dog is watching to see that no one rolls you\r\nfor your wad. Or wasn't it a debauch that kept you out all night?\r\nAnyway, I'll bet you made your rounds in a Renault you rented from the\r\nPhoenix Garage.\r\n\r\nThe _Marques de Avillar_ was being eased into its dock. The cab drivers\r\nwere waving at the passengers lined up at the rail, and Marina was\r\nhopping up and down, shouting and waving a big yellow handkerchief like\r\na banner. The coffee _por favor_ has grown cold and _por favor_ a pot of\r\nhot _por favor_ and that's the idea _muchas gracias_ and you could have\r\ndocked the _Marques_ in my last yawn. Hall drank a steaming cup of hot\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nThe gangplank was being wheeled to the ship. There was a knot of ship's\r\nofficers on the lower deck. They shook hands with the customs men and\r\nthe medicos who trotted up the gangplank, led them inside to the main\r\nsalon. Men in blue uniforms with official papers under their arms. A\r\npress photographer and a bald roly-poly reporter. They'll be out in a\r\nminute, and damn it the morning sun is growing too bright for a pair of\r\ntired old eyes, and dipping his napkin in the fresh cold water on the\r\ntable Hall shoved the cold compress against his heavy eyes.\r\n\r\nTwo cups of coffee later, the first of the passengers from the _Marques\r\nde Avillar_ emerged from the salon and walked down the gangplank.\r\nPriests--Hall counted twenty--followed by scrawny stewards with their\r\nbags. A few of the priests were old, but most of them were young men who\r\ncarried themselves erect, their shoulders squared well back, their walk\r\nthe off-duty walk of the officer on leave from the front. Hall wondered\r\nhow many of the younger men in clerical collars were really priests and\r\nhow many of them were used to wearing other uniforms. He remembered the\r\nday, less than two months earlier, when the C.T.E. liner _Cabo de\r\nHornos_ had docked in Havana and one of General Benitez' men had grown\r\nsuspicious of two of the Spanish priests on board; a brief discussion of\r\ntheology had been followed by a thorough search of their luggage, and\r\nthe young travelers woke up the next morning to find themselves learning\r\ntheology in the concentration camp on the Isla de Pinas.\r\n\r\nHall was humming \"Onward, Christian Soldiers.\" He watched two young\r\npriests get into Pepe's cab and be driven away. The priests, and later\r\nfour nuns, entered the cabs in pairs. Then, following some customs men,\r\none of the ship's officers came out of the salon with a man in a black\r\nsuit and a Panama hat. They carried thick portfolios under their arms,\r\nand behind them followed a steward with two heavy hand trunks.\r\n\r\nThere was a blur of green and yellow on the gangplank, and then Marina\r\nwas on the lower deck, exchanging wild embraces with the ship's officer\r\nand the man in the Panama hat. The three men walked down the gangplank,\r\nMarina happily bringing up the rear behind the officer. He darted in\r\nfront of his friends when they reached the pier and signaled one of the\r\ncabs. The first cab in line rolled up to the curb and picked them up.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone into Hall's face. He washed his eyes with cold water, had\r\nanother cup of coffee. Thick, the air is growing thick and heavy. Hell\r\nwith it. Olive oil and garlic, coffee, squids, mussels, saffron,\r\nmackerel, heat. \"_Besame_\" on the juke box again. Don't run off just\r\nyet. Look at the watch. Start to get impatient. _Hombre de negocios_\r\nwaiting for a colleague to work out a deal. A ton of coffee, three box\r\ncars of ore, a round ton of sugar. He's way overdue and you're getting\r\nimpatient, but you don't leave yet. You don't leave and show the little\r\ndog wherever he or his partners are hiding that you had breakfast here\r\nthis morning just to keep an eye on the _Marques de Avillar_. No, senor,\r\nyou would not be as careless as the faggot. No, senor, oh no, senor,\r\nonly the air is getting thicker and somewhere in the kitchen someone is\r\nlooking at me and laughing I swear it I swear it only I can't help it\r\nthis is the only face I have.\r\n\r\nSoft laughter. Eyes looking in his direction. The now blazing sun. The\r\nflags on the mast of the white ship; crimson and gold of Fernando e\r\nIsabel, the triangular pennant of the C.T.E., and the mucking five\r\narrows of the Falange floating insolently in the breeze over the heart\r\nof a democracy. Don't leave too soon. Look at your watch again and curse\r\nthe mucking _hombre de negocios_ who's holding up your big deal. And\r\nwhat was the name of the C.T.E. radio officer from the _Ciudad de\r\nSevilla_ whom poor old Fielding had in his report? Jimenez, Eduardo\r\nJimenez, thank God, my memory for names is like a sponge and what would\r\nyou say if the ship's officer who got that _abrazo de amor_ from the\r\nfaggot was C.T.E. Radio Officer Jimenez and damn the sun and damn the\r\nolive oil on the hot stove chunks of garlic and squid floating in the\r\nhot oil and stinking up the thick murky air and it's cooler with the\r\ncollar open.\r\n\r\nEyes looking at him from the kitchen. Soft laughter. Some joke. Hall is\r\ncockeyed on _cafe con leche_ and what's that it's the cup you lug and\r\nwhat's that it's the coffee spilling all over your pants and if those\r\nempty-faced bastards in the kitchen don't stop laughing I'll get right\r\nup from the floor and put a right cross through their lousy guts. That's\r\njust the ticket. Clip them with the old right, like the time in San\r\nSebastian when the gonzo with the feather in his hat made the mistake of\r\ngetting within range. Watch the old right, keed, watch the old K.O.\r\nsockeroo. Watch it, watch it, don't forget to duck. WATCH IT!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe driver of the rickety four-wheeled bus was thumping time with fat\r\nbrown fingers on the rim of the heavy wheel. He didn't sing, just sat in\r\nhis bucket seat with the faded flowered cretonne slip cover (bet you a\r\ngood dinner his wife sewed it for him when he got the job) and thumped\r\ntime. The kid with the guitar in the front seat was doing the singing.\r\n\"Ay, Jalisco, Jalisco.\" He was a nice kid and drunk as a loon, but sweet\r\nand happy drunk. Nothing ugly about the kid. \"Ay, Jalisco, Jalisco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is he singing?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\nBehind him, someone in the rear seat answered, \"He's happy. His favorite\r\nbaseball team won the San Hermano tournament.\"\r\n\r\nHall turned with a start, faced an impassive-looking farmer in blue\r\njeans.\r\n\r\n\"You were fast asleep, senor,\" the farmer said.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Jalisco, Jalisco.\" A bad dream. Go back to sleep. Or better yet,\r\nwake up and put the light on. But the light was on. The dim yellow\r\nlights inside the bus. \"Ay, Jalisco, Jalisco.\" Scots wha hae wi' Wallace\r\nfled. Scots wha ... God, no! A new song. No more Jalisco. The farmer\r\ncame into the town his cheeses ripe his mangoes brown he spied a maiden\r\nby her stall she ... God, no!\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Muchachita, Muchachita.\" The kid was still in the groove.\r\nFour-string chord, six-string chord. _Un beso, un beso! Reflecciones de\r\notros tiempos._ More nice chords. The farmer remembers other times,\r\nother maidens who pursed their lips and gave him _un beso_ when he\r\nbegged. What am I to the farmer and what is he to Hecuba?\r\n\r\n\"For a _borracho_ he sings well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with a skinful he is a virtuoso.\" The sound of his own words\r\nstartled Hall. He turned around to the man who had spoken to him. The\r\nfarmer smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, senor,\" the farmer smiled, \"but tonight you are a little of\r\nthe virtuoso yourself, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" God, no!\r\n\r\n\"I apologize, senor. You are not well?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am well.\" But where in hell am I? _Ay, muchachita, muchachita._\r\nCigars in the coat pocket. Broken, all of them. Smashed to shreds. I\r\nfell on them. When I fell they were smashed. Cigarettes in the side\r\npocket. Black tobacco, thicker than the cigarettes back home,\r\nbrown-paper package. _Bock, La Habana._\r\n\r\n\"Have you a match?\" That's a good one. Felipe's been waiting three years\r\nfor J. Burton Skidmore to say it. \"_Tiene usted un fo'foro?_\" Very\r\nwelcome. Yes, they are Cuban. No, I am not Cuban myself. I dropped the\r\n_s_ in _fosforo_? I have recently spent some time in Cuba. Yes, Batista\r\nis a fine man. Where are you going? Is this your village?\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, friend.\" This from outside, the farmer standing on the dirt\r\nroad, Hall's gift cigarette glowing in his mouth. A tiny village.\r\nHouses, store, the whitewashed village school, a cast-iron statue of San\r\nMartin and Bolivar shaking hands, an open-front cafe, the small church.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, friend.\" The kid with the guitar waved at Hall. \"When did you\r\nget on the bus?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Good. Neither do I. What's your favorite song?\"\r\n\r\n\"_No Pasaran._\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" the kid said. \"It is a good song.\" His fingers flew over\r\nthe strings, found the right chords. Hall joined him in the words of the\r\nSpanish Republic's song of resistance.\r\n\r\nNight, deep-blue night, the yellow mazdas of the farmers' village way\r\nbehind them now, and the _gua-gua_ rolling down the highway between\r\nplowed fields and fields of sugar and nothing in sight but the broad\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, driver!\" That was me. I can talk now. I can stand, too. If I grip\r\nthe tops of the seats I can walk to the front without taking a pratt\r\nfall. \"Driver, _gua-guero_ ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Jump, it's not high, senor ...\"\r\n\r\nFeet on the ground once more. Black blue soft chill night air. There\r\ngoes the _gua-gua_. Red tail light bouncing around the bend in the road.\r\nNo ship. No sun. No garlic broiling in olive oil. Nothing. Get off the\r\nroad. Get up. Off the road. Get to the fence. Get up, get up, here comes\r\nthe blackout again, here it comes, watch it, men, this is it.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the kid with the guitar, the rich voice of the driver.\r\n_Jump, it's not high._ It was still night. He was lying in a field,\r\nabout fifteen yards from the highway. The taste of black earth at his\r\nlips had awakened him.\r\n\r\nHe turned his mouth away from the plowed earth. There was no sense in\r\ntrying to get up. He knew that much. All in. He was all in. Every bone,\r\nevery muscle ached. He closed his eyes, sank into a deep dreamless\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThirst wakened him. It was a thirst that started in his throat, spread\r\nto his dry cottony mouth, sank deep into his drying insides. They were\r\ndrying out, drying out fast. He had to have water, or they would dry up\r\ncompletely, and then he would be dead.\r\n\r\nI am now an animal, he thought. I must have animal cunning. I must sense\r\nwater and then I must get to it. Where things grow there must be water.\r\nA stream. A well.\r\n\r\nHe got to his knees, started to crawl deeper into the plowed field,\r\nputting another few yards between himself and the road. He crawled into\r\na clump of weeds. The dew on their leaves brushed against his face.\r\n\"It's water,\" he said, and he licked the dew from the weeds. The thirst\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nFire. Build a fire and attract a watchman, a farmer, another bus rolling\r\nalong the deserted road. No, don't build a fire. Cane burns like oil.\r\nRemember what poor old Fielding said? No fire. You'll be roasted alive.\r\nFind water. It's a sugar field. Must be an irrigation ditch around. Find\r\nthe ditch.\r\n\r\nMore ground gained by crawling. Then the sleep of exhaustion, no dreams\r\nonly sleep until the thirst becomes stronger than the exhaustion and\r\nthen more crawling until ... God! there is a ditch. Hear it, smell it.\r\nMust be water, couldn't be this much mulepiss. Now drink your fill and\r\nbathe your face and get your head away from the top of the ditch before\r\nyou fall asleep again and drown in two inches of it. It has a name. It's\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThis time Hall rolled over on his back when he felt that sleep was\r\novertaking him.\r\n\r\nThere were a million bugs on the mud walls of the ditch. They crawled on\r\nHall's hands, on his face, and one column of intrepid bugs slithered\r\ninto his mouth and got caught in his throat and he was sick. He moved\r\naway from the mess, tried to sit up. He could see a mound of rocks near\r\nthe road. With all his remaining strength, he started to crawl toward\r\nthe mound.\r\n\r\nIt took him two hours to negotiate the twenty yards between the ditch\r\nand the rocks. He lost count of the number of times he collapsed to his\r\nface and fell asleep on the journey. All he knew was that when he woke\r\nup, he had to get to the rocks. He could sit on the rocks and wait for a\r\ntruck or a bus to pass by. Then he could hail the driver.\r\n\r\nBut when he reached the fence, he saw that the mound was on the other\r\nside of the road. Fall asleep in the middle of the road and the next\r\ntruck that rolls along crushes you like a roach. _Putas y maricones!\r\nMaricones y putas!_ Blood will run in the streets of the city when I get\r\nup, the brown blood, the black blood, the blue blood. _Arriba Espana_ in\r\na pig's eye. You mean _Deutschland Erwache_, senor, and come a little\r\ncloser, you with the yoke and the five arrows on your cap, come a little\r\ncloser and get your filthy head bashed in. God, when I get up I'll kill\r\nthem I'll kill them if these chills ever go away I'll kill them I'll\r\nkill all the baby killers when these chills go away oh God look at the\r\nbaby killers marching through Burgos with the holy men shaking holy\r\nwater on their lousy heads. Whores and faggots! Faggots and whores! I'm\r\ngetting up!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was asleep when the army lorry roared by and then stopped down the\r\nroad, brakes screeching, rubber biting into macadam.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant's brandy did no good. Neither did the fresh water they\r\npoured on his face, the brandy they rubbed into his wrists. All this\r\nthey had to tell him later.\r\n\r\nHe remembered nothing about the lorry. The bus he remembered; the\r\ndriver, the flowered-cretonne slip cover on the driver's seat, the\r\nfarmer, joining the kid in _No Pasaran_. He remembered jumping from the\r\nbus, crawling for water, giving up the ghost when the bugs crawled into\r\nhis throat. And the rocks. There was that mound of rocks.\r\n\r\nNow there was a narrow bed in a small room. A man's room, obviously a\r\nman's room. Desk, lounging chair, worn grass rug. For some reason\r\nFernando Souza was sitting in the lounging chair. Another man was\r\nstanding near the bed, looking down at Hall, his fingers pressed to\r\nHall's pulse.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Souza?\" Hall asked, and the night clerk of the Bolivar\r\nleft the chair and joined the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"You will be well now,\" Souza said.\r\n\r\n\"The pulse is coming back,\" the doctor said, to Souza. He let go of\r\nHall's wrist. When he went to the desk, Hall could see the military\r\ntrousers beneath his white coat.\r\n\r\n\"Can you talk, Don Mateo?\" Souza asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think so. Where am I? What day is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor went to the door. He held a whispered conversation with a\r\nsoldier who was waiting on the other side of the door. Then he took\r\nSouza's chair. \"Such cursing,\" he laughed. \"When they brought you in,\r\nSenor Hall, you had no pulse, you had the temperature of cold beer, and\r\nyour heart had just about three beats left. You were biologically more\r\ndead than alive. But I swear, before I gave you the first ampule of\r\nadrenalin, the curses were pouring out of your lips like the waves of\r\nthe ocean. How do you feel now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be able to eat soon. I've been feeding you through a needle for\r\nseven hours. How would you like a steak?\"\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five o'clock,\" Souza said. \"I've been here with you all afternoon, Don\r\nMateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this 'Don' business?\"\r\n\r\nSouza smiled. \"I am glad to see that you are making jokes, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where in hell are we?\"\r\n\r\nSouza and the doctor took turns in telling the story. The soldiers had\r\npicked him up in the road some ninety miles from San Hermano. More dead\r\nthan alive, they put him in the lorry and rushed him to their garrison.\r\nThere, while the commandant examined his papers, the doctor, Captain\r\nDorado, moved him into the commandant's room and gave him his first shot\r\nof adrenalin.\r\n\r\n\"Was it a heart attack?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the doctor said. \"You were drugged.\"\r\n\r\nHall listened to the doctor's technical description of the drug which\r\nhad felled him. He had heard of it before. It worked like an overdose of\r\ninsulin. Burned up the sugar, then the energy in the body, and then blew\r\nthe fuses. Something like that, anyway. Another hour without adrenalin\r\nand it would have been curtains. That second pot of coffee and the soft\r\nlaughter in the kitchen. Damn their eyes, that's where it happened. Then\r\neight hours of lying in the commandant's bed, cursing, sleeping, getting\r\nneedles of adrenalin, needles of energy, needles of the stuff that makes\r\npulses beat to the right measure.\r\n\r\n\"Are we tiring you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Captain. I'd like something to eat, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ordered some hot broth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I'm glad you're here, Fernando.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commandant called me,\" Souza said. \"He found your address through\r\nPan American Airways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" The letter. It had gone to Pan Am for forwarding. Then it was\r\nstill safe.\r\n\r\n\"I will return in a few minutes,\" the doctor said. \"I want to see about\r\nyour broth.\"\r\n\r\nSouza waited until the doctor was out of the room before he spoke.\r\n\"Providence was with you,\" he said. \"The commandant here is a Tabio man.\r\nHe called me at once to find out who you were. Another man might have\r\ncalled your Embassy first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they called the Embassy yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to the men the _maricon_ met at the pier?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have them under sharp eyes. They went first to Jorge Davila's home.\r\nThen they went to the country. They are in Bocas del Sur at the estate\r\nof Gamburdo's brother, the cattle raiser. The _maricon_ left them there.\r\nHe is now in San Hermano with Ansaldo. They were to be with Don Anibal\r\nthis afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"With Ansaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"When are you going back to the Bolivar?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her that I telephoned to say that I would be out of the city\r\ntonight. I was to see her for dinner. What about the priests from the\r\nboat? Are they all really priests?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? Perhaps I shall know more when I return to the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will I be on my back?\" Hall asked. \"Did the doctor say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not long. You have recovered from the drug, he says. Now you need food\r\nand another day's rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor returned followed by a soldier who carried a small tray. \"Hot\r\nsoup,\" he said. \"And after the soup, some rich beef stew. But first,\r\nsome brandy. Three glasses, corporal. We'll drink to the memory of\r\nLazarus.\" He helped Hall sit up in bed, propped some pillows behind his\r\nback. Only when he sat up did Hall notice that a large signed photograph\r\nof Anibal Tabio hung over the commandant's desk.\r\n\r\n\"Let's rather drink to the health of Anibal Tabio,\" Hall proposed.\r\n\r\nSouza and the doctor watched with approval as Hall ate the soup and the\r\nstew, and then sipped mate through a silver straw. \"He's going to be\r\nwell in a matter of hours,\" the doctor said. \"Well enough to start\r\ncursing again. It is a shame that I do not know English. But your\r\nSpanish curses were enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was I cursing?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"What didn't you curse, senor? Franco, _putas, maricones_, Hitler,\r\nGamburdo, the Cross and Sword ...\"\r\n\r\n\"God! Who heard me?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled. \"Be tranquil,\" he said. \"Just the commandant and\r\nmyself, and one of the soldiers. But you don't have to worry about the\r\nsoldier. He is the son of a miner in the north.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soldier,\" Souza said, \"is reliable. I have already seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are among friends,\" the doctor said. \"Souza has told us about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I owe my life to you,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"From what I have learned,\" the doctor laughed, \"you are not an easy man\r\nto kill.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can I get out of bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow. That is just as well, senor. The garrison tailor is cleaning\r\nyour suit now. Would you like more mate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I have another brandy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. But then you must sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired of sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared for that.\" The doctor called for the corporal, ordered\r\nhim to prepare a hypodermic syringe. \"You must get some sleep, senor,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the doctor pronounced Hall well enough to leave the\r\ncommandant's bed. Hall's clothes, the suit cleaned and freshly pressed,\r\nthe shirt washed and ironed, the shoes polished to a glow, were laid out\r\non a chair near the bed. \"We do things thoroughly in the army,\" the\r\ndoctor said.\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commandant would like to join you for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the officers' mess?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please tell him that I would be honored.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Can you dress yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, thanks to you, Captain. I feel as if I'd had a week's\r\nrest on some quiet beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get the commandant, then. The corporal will show you the way to\r\nthe washroom. I've laid out my razor and shaving things for you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was good to stand on steadied legs again, good to walk erect like a\r\nman. The razor had a nice edge. It sliced through the stems of the\r\ntwo-day beard without snagging. For some reason, the efficiency of the\r\nrazor delighted Hall beyond measure. He studied the results of the shave\r\nin the wall mirror, then looked for signs of his illness. Two days were\r\nlost, he thought, two days of which he could account for but a few\r\nhours. The doctor could fill in most of the second day. The first night\r\nwas something Hall himself could remember. It was like a bad dream one\r\nlongs to forget, but he could remember the bus, the field, the ditch,\r\nthe rock pile. He could remember staggering, crawling, getting sick,\r\npassing out and crawling and passing out again. But there were at least\r\nten hours that remained a total blank; that portion of the day between\r\nthe time he blacked out in the cafe near the Spanish line's pier and the\r\nmoment he became aware of the kid in the bus.\r\n\r\nAn enlisted man was cleaning up the commandant's room when Hall\r\nreturned. \"The major will be here in five minutes,\" he told Hall. \"And\r\nin the meanwhile, he sent you these.\" He handed Hall a flat tin of\r\nAmerican cigarettes.\r\n\r\nHall offered one of the cigarettes to the soldier. He sat down in the\r\nleather chair near the desk, looked at the inscription on Tabio's\r\nphotograph. \"To my dear Diego, my comrade in prison and in\r\nfreedom--Anibal.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commandant is a close friend of Don Anibal's,\" the soldier said. \"I\r\nthink I hear him coming now.\" The soldier stepped out of the room.\r\n\r\nA moment later someone rapped gently on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" Hall shouted.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. In the doorway, a man in uniform, his hat carried\r\ncorrectly under his left arm, paused, made a soft salute. \"Major Diego\r\nSegador,\" he said. \"We are honored to have you as our guest.\" He shook\r\nhands with Hall, sat down in the desk chair facing the portrait of\r\nTabio.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to you for--everything,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"It was nothing,\" Segador said. \"After Souza spoke to me about you, I\r\nwas sorry we could not do more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What more could you have done?\"\r\n\r\nThe major's lips parted over his long teeth in a mirthless smile. \"We\r\ncould have killed the _cabron_ who drugged you, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It could have been anyone in that cafe. What's the matter with Delgado?\r\nDidn't he know it is owned by a dirty Falangist?\" Color rose to the\r\nmajor's dark cheeks. He was a man of Hall's own years, shorter, but with\r\na pair of powerful hands capable of hiding the hands of a man twice his\r\nsize. The hands were gripping the arms of his chair now, the knuckles\r\nwhite as the major fought to control his rage. Hall knew the feeling,\r\nsensed the fires that burned in the major's head. He called me\r\n_companero_ a moment ago, he thought, he knows what I'm after.\r\n\r\n\"Pepe is all right,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"He should have more brains.\" The major opened the locked middle drawer\r\nof his desk, pulled out a sealed brown envelope. \"Your papers,\" he said.\r\n\"Please examine them and see if everything is present.\"\r\n\r\nHall tore open the envelope, shook the contents to the desk. Passport,\r\nwallet, not more than fifty pesos missing, a book of travelers' checks,\r\nsome sheets of blank paper, a small leather address book, wrist watch,\r\nthe Bock cigarettes. Except for the fifty pesos, everything else which\r\nbelonged in the wallet was there, money, pictures, cards, the letter\r\nfrom Havana.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is missing,\" Hall said. He took the letter from its envelope\r\nand counted the pages.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry I had to read your love letter,\" Segador said. \"But it was\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Hall said. \"But it is not a love letter.\"\r\n\r\nThe massive face of the major reflected his surprise. \"Not a love\r\nletter?\" he asked. \"Ah, here's the coffee. Come in, corporal. Set the\r\ntrays down on the desk.\"\r\n\r\nHall waited until the corporal left. \"It is not a love letter,\" he\r\nrepeated. \"I would like very much to interpret it for you. I think it\r\nmight explain why I was drugged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before you start,\" the major said, \"there are two things that you\r\nshould know. The first is that Souza has given me a fairly good idea of\r\nwhy you came to our country. The second is that for your own sake, and\r\nfor ours, I had to notify your Embassy that we had picked you up drunk\r\nin a village cafe last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, _companero_. I mean no disrespect, but your Embassy is not\r\nvery much in sympathy with many things a man like yourself is willing to\r\ndie defending. Under the circumstances, you can spare yourself some\r\nunnecessary trouble if you say merely that you were drunk. If you stick\r\nto this story, you can help yourself and, to be very frank, you can help\r\nDon Anibal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are his friend, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe major got to his feet. \"His friend?\" He undid his tie, then took his\r\nshirt off. His torso was a mass of old and, for the main part,\r\nimproperly sewn scars. Mementoes of bullets, steel whips, knives. \"My\r\nrepublicanism is more than skin deep, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I can tell you everything.\" Hall dipped into the tin of American\r\ncigarettes. \"It started in San Juan,\" he began, \"or rather it really\r\nstarted in Geneva, when I met Don Anibal for the first time. But it was\r\nin San Juan that I read that Dr. Ansaldo was on his way to San Hermano\r\nto treat Don Anibal. And if I may jump to the end of my story first,\r\nthis love letter seems to confirm what I suspected about Ansaldo. Do you\r\nsee what it says here about the doctor who treated Carlos?\"\r\n\r\nFor an hour, Hall told Segador of what he had learned and experienced\r\nsince arriving in the country. The major interrupted with questions\r\nfrequently, made notes in a small black notebook. \"Please,\" he said,\r\nwhen Hall finished his account, \"I am going to repeat the important\r\nparts of the story to you. Correct me if I am wrong or if I leave\r\nanything out.\"\r\n\r\nHe recited the story back to Hall, then consulted his watch. \"The Press\r\nSecretary of your Embassy is due to call for you in a few minutes,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Please remember your story. You were drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I with a _puta_?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\nThe major grinned. \"No,\" he said, \"that I did not think necessary.\r\nAlthough if it were, I assure you I would tell your Embassy that you\r\nwere with the mangiest _puta_ in six provinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to say. In the meanwhile, I think there is something you\r\nneed.\" He took a large automatic out of his desk, slipped a clip of\r\nbullets into its grip, and handed the gun and a small box of cartridges\r\nto Hall. \"If we could only prove to Don Anibal before it is too late\r\nthat Ansaldo ...\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must find a way. In the meanwhile, stay alive for the next few days.\r\nI have friends. They will watch for your safety. Souza, others. They\r\nwill bring you my messages. And be careful in cafes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter nine_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Embassy sent a well-dressed young attache to call for Hall\r\nin the morning. He arrived in a low-slung yellow sedan, introduced\r\nhimself as Orville Smith, snubbed everyone in sight, and relaxed only\r\nwhen he and Hall were well out of sight of the camp. \"They said that you\r\nsure hung one on,\" he said pleasantly and, Hall realized, with even a\r\ntouch of admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Must have been something I ate,\" Hall answered.\r\n\r\n\"Glad you turned up intact, old man. Might have led to some amusing\r\ncomplications. If the major had called five minutes later, this would\r\nhave appeared on the front page of _El Imparcial_ this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave Hall a galley proof of a news story. _Missing American Writer\r\nBelieved Victim of Communists._ Missing since yesterday ... last seen\r\nleaving hotel ... On Wednesday, at American Embassy party, Hall had\r\ndiscussed Red threats to his safety, told publisher of _Imparcial_ that\r\ngiant Red assassin had followed him day before ... Embassy officials\r\ndescribed Hall as author of book on experiences on _H.M.S. Revenger_ ...\r\nThe missing American failed to phone or keep appointment made with\r\npublisher of _Imparcial_ in connection with Soviet threats ... Feared\r\nabducted and killed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Politics. They take their politics seriously down here. Was it true\r\nthat you were followed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But not by the Reds. By the fascists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any fascists down here?\" This in a tone of detached\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\"A few. How well do you know Fernandez?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well. He's one of the few gentlemen in San Hermano. Comes from an\r\nold Spanish aristocratic family. Did you really have an appointment with\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't definite. He told me he had heard of some Red plot to bump me\r\noff. I just kidded him along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fernandez is really very well informed,\" Smith said. \"He has a\r\ncrack staff of reporters, and the information that they pick up\r\nshouldn't be ignored.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hall said. \"I hear he's good. Matter of fact, I heard\r\n_Imparcial_ is getting the Cabot Prize this year.\"\r\n\r\nIt was like a shaft driven into Smith's armor. \"No!\" he exclaimed. \"Who\r\ntold you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some _puta_,\" Hall said, dryly. \"In bed.\" He watched the blood rushing\r\nto Orville Smith's head. \"You'd be surprised at what a gal who sleeps\r\naround can pick up.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was pulling your leg, Hall.\"\r\n\r\nHall grinned. \"Please, Mr. Smith,\" he said. \"Gentlemen don't discuss\r\nsuch things.\" Smith grew redder.\r\n\r\n\"Not to change the subject,\" Hall said, \"but what's cooking in town? In\r\npolitics, for example. Doesn't the Congress open today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really. They have the ceremonial opening this afternoon. According\r\nto tradition, the President speaks to the entire Congress. Then they\r\nsettle down to a week of reviewing last year's business. The first\r\nworking session really starts in about ten days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And today I guess Gamburdo is speaking instead of Tabio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, beyond a doubt. Tabio is really on his last legs, old man. I\r\nsuppose I should feel sorry about the old coot, but then you learn\r\nthings in my game.\"\r\n\r\n\"About Tabio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. We had information that in his address to the Congress, Tabio\r\nwas planning to call for the nationalization of all the mines in the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Smith said, \"because he was being forced into it, I guess. I've\r\nmet Tabio and he's not as bad as his enemies make him out to be. But\r\nwhat are you going to do when you are elected by a Popular Front\r\nmajority? The Communist Senators and Deputies are all from the mining\r\nprovinces up north. They've been hollering for the nationalization of\r\nthe mines for twenty years. Now they're strong enough to put the squeeze\r\non Tabio.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't Gamburdo in the Popular Front?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo is different,\" Smith said. \"He has different ideas, and he\r\ncan't be pressured by the bolos.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing a story on Gamburdo for a magazine back in the States. You\r\nget around. Tell me more about Gamburdo. I've got him down as the coming\r\nman on the continent. Am I half cocked, or is he really hot?\"\r\n\r\nOrville Smith discussed Gamburdo, Tabio, the political scene. He talked\r\nabout the politicos, about their ideas, about the gossip which followed\r\nthem in their careers. Carefully prodded by Hall, he spoke fluently for\r\nnearly two hours. It was a very revealing monologue. It told Hall how\r\nOrville Smith had spent his three years in San Hermano. Week-end parties\r\nat the estates of wealthy Spanish planters. Dinners, cocktails, high\r\nmasses, weddings, fishing trips with the Vardienos and the Fernandezes\r\nand the Gamburdos. Info straight from the horse's mouth.\r\n\r\nTabio the tool and or agent of bolshevism. The better element. How\r\nsocial legislation would push taxes up and cut down returns on American\r\ninvestments. Vardieno gives lovely parties on his island. No, not many\r\nlately. No oil for the boats, hard enough to get it for his narrow-gauge\r\nDiesel locomotives. Fine lad, young Quinones; made the golf team at\r\nPrinceton. The Vardieno girl in the Press Bureau? That would be the one\r\nwho went to finishing school in the States. She just started in at the\r\nBureau for some experience. Cross and Sword? Oh, I know the pinkos back\r\nhome would call it fascist. It's not, really. Conservative, for free\r\nenterprise and private ownership. All the better-element folks belong or\r\nsupport it. Do I know any labor leaders? No, never met one. Did I ever\r\nspend a week-end in a small village hotel? No, thank you, the roaches\r\nare bigger than sparrows in the sticks.\r\n\r\nHall thought about the art of diplomacy. You take a kid from the FFV's\r\nand at an early age you wrap him in cellophane and send him off to some\r\nnice, prophylactic boarding school, well-heeled white Gentiles only,\r\nthank you, High Episcopalians preferred, and only nice clean thoughts,\r\nnone of them less than a century old, are gently swished against the\r\ncellophane until some of them seep through by osmosis. He meets only the\r\nsons of the better element and outside of an adolescent clap he picks up\r\non one wild week-end with some of the boys in New York he has no real\r\nproblem until he's eased out of prep and then he has an idea he wants to\r\ngo to Harvard but the family prevails and he does time at Princeton,\r\nnearly makes varsity football but a high tackle in a practice scrimmage\r\nchanges his mind, and then he is ready for his place on the board of the\r\nmill but someone--a nice girl of fine breeding, no doubt--puts another\r\nidea in his head. So he goes to Georgetown, fills out a lot of nasty\r\nforms, and then, _voila!_, the young monsieur arrives in Paris as Third\r\nSecretary and dreamily sends that first letter home to the folks: Hello\r\nFolks, here I am in Gay Paree learning how to be an Ambassador.\r\n\r\nAnd then in Paris, Hall thought, listening to Orville Smith, your young\r\nThird Secretary naturally gravitates to his French equivalents, the\r\nyoung bluebloods who were reared in French cellophane and got the same\r\nideas, only in French, in their own versions of Princeton and Groton.\r\nThe better element meets the better element, and he makes factual,\r\nintelligent reports. The Popular Front falling into hands of the bolos.\r\nThis he learns at a week-end party on Flandin's yacht. The Croix de Feu\r\nand the Cagoulards are fine, conservative forces. Only the pinkos call\r\nthem fascists, but Bertrand de Juvenal, the fledgling ambassador's pal,\r\nknows otherwise. Sit-down strikes, forty-hour week, vacations with\r\npay--he puts them all down in his reports; communist, of course. Got the\r\nlowdown on the beach at Cannes just the other day. Daladier is the man\r\nto watch. Yes, he is in the Popular Front. But Daladier's different.\r\nHe's like Monsieur Laval, the French Calvin Coolidge. Fine force for\r\nsensible government. There will be no war, Munich has settled that. Got\r\nthe lowdown from Flandin himself. Germany will be defeated. Spent a most\r\nfascinating week-end with General Weygand. Marechal Petain is man of the\r\nhour. Marechal Petain will make France another Verdun. Vichy wants to be\r\nfriends with Washington. The Marechal indignantly denies, in private,\r\nthat that was a Nazi salute you saw in the newsreels, sir, he says he\r\nwas just waving at the cameramen. But Bertrand de Juvenal does not deny,\r\nand Laval does not deny, and Daladier weeps in his collapsed house of\r\ncards. And then comes the transfer to San Hermano at a better rating.\r\n\r\nSmith pointed to the suburbs of San Hermano ahead of them. \"We made good\r\ntime,\" he said. \"We'll be in the Embassy in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good going. You can drop me at the Bolivar, if you don't mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, old man. But say, why don't you drop by for a spot of lunch\r\nwith the old man and the boys at the Embassy? We'd love to have you with\r\nus and, besides, the old man will probably want to see for himself that\r\nyou're in one piece.\"\r\n\r\nHall looked at his watch. \"What time do you have lunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"About one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I'd like to join you. But I'll still have time to stop off at the\r\nBolivar to change and pick up my mail. I'm expecting a letter from my\r\nsweetheart.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPepe was waiting in his cab in front of the Bolivar. He was contrite and\r\nsubdued. \"I nearly killed you with my stupidity, Mateo,\" he said. \"I\r\nshould have known that cafe was owned by Falangistas.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing, Pepe. I had it coming to me. I'm all over it now, anyway.\r\nWhat's new?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the complete list of where the passengers from the _Marques de\r\nAvillar_ are staying. Their names, too. Except the names of the two men\r\nwho are at the Gamburdo ranch. But they are still there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you recognize any of the names?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends are examining the lists now. I'll have them back for you in\r\nthe evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Duarte?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him about you. He wants you to call him at the Mexican Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, later. I have to go to my room for a minute, and then I want\r\nyou to take me to the American Embassy. I'm having lunch there.\" He\r\nentered the hotel and asked for his mail at the desk. There was a\r\nmessage from Jerry, a short gossipy note from his publisher, and another\r\nlove letter from Havana.\r\n\r\nThe note from Jerry was very short. \"I missed you, you dog,\" it said.\r\n\"Phone me when you return to town. Jerry.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter from Havana, mailed the day after the first letter, was\r\nalmost a duplicate of the first. Again it protested its love, but this\r\ntime it said, \"How many times must I tell you that the man you think is\r\nyour rival is unworthy of all human decencies? Far from being a rival in\r\nmy eyes, I look upon him as a creature worse than an assassin. You must\r\nbelieve me; I detest the man.\" Hall put the letter in his wallet.\r\n\r\nHe examined his room carefully. It had not been searched, the\r\nstethoscope was still in its hiding place, his clothes were just as he\r\nhad left them. Everything was as it had been. Hall took out his portable\r\ntypewriter, copied the _El Imparcial_ story which had been killed, and\r\nsealed the copy in an envelope. He went downstairs, got into the cab,\r\nand slipped the envelope into Pepe's pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Give the envelope to Dr. Gonzales,\" he said. \"And tell him to get the\r\ninformation to Major Segador right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drive right out to the doctor as soon as I leave you. Shall I wait\r\nfor you outside of the American Embassy after I see the doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you'd better.\"\r\n\r\nAmbassador Skidmore seemed pleased to see Hall. \"You gave us quite a\r\nscare, young fellow,\" he said, his ruddy face beaming, white hair\r\nbobbing as Skidmore shook his head from side to side in mock anxiety.\r\n\"Ah, you newspaper boys,\" he laughed. \"Always going off on a tear when\r\nyou are least expected to! And here poor Joe Fernandez was so sure that\r\nthe Reds had made hamburger out of you, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry I spoiled a good story,\" Hall said. \"I'd better call\r\nFernandez on the phone before he sends out another alarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need to, my boy,\" the Ambassador said. \"Joe Fernandez is joining us\r\nat lunch.\"\r\n\r\nFernandez showed up with a former Senator, a dignified old dandy named\r\nRios, who sported a silver-headed cane, a waxed, dyed mustache, and a\r\nCross and Sword emblem in his lapel. They shared the table in the\r\nAmbassador's small private dining room with Hall, Orville Smith and the\r\nAmbassador.\r\n\r\nThe publisher fawned over Hall like a long-lost brother. \"You are safe,\"\r\nhe exclaimed. \"Thanks be to the Virgin Mother! What happened? Was it\r\nvery bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got drunk,\" Hall said. \"That's all that happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous, Senor Hall! You are a man who can take his drink. You were\r\ndrugged. Mark my words, senor, you were drugged. You don't know these\r\nReds.\"\r\n\r\nOrville Smith winked broadly at Hall. \"The main thing is,\" he said to\r\nFernandez, \"that Hall is safe now. I'm sure he appreciates your concern,\r\nDon Jose.\" In deference to the Ambassador's three-word Spanish\r\nvocabulary, Smith and the others spoke English. Rios, who spoke only\r\nSpanish, sat between Skidmore and Smith, who acted as their interpreter.\r\n\r\n\"What province did you represent in the Senate?\" Hall asked the former\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\n\"San Martin, in the north.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Joaquin is a great statesman,\" Fernandez interrupted. \"But when El\r\nTovarich prepared his gangsters for the elections two years ago, he\r\narmed the Red miners and they held their guns in the ribs of Don\r\nJoaquin's majority.\"\r\n\r\nHall listened to Smith translate this account of Rios' defeat at the\r\npolls before he spoke. \"And do you plan to run again, Senor Rios?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nFernandez answered for the dandy. \"He will run again,\" he shouted, \"and\r\nhe will be elected. Fire can fight fire. Guns can fight guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have _pantalones_,\" Rios said. \"I am a man of honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Joaquin's constituents demand that he runs again,\" Fernandez said.\r\nHe turned to the Ambassador, became his own translator. The ex-Senator\r\nnodded happily at every word Fernandez addressed to the Ambassador, as\r\nif by nodding he could bolster the words whose meaning he had to guess.\r\n\r\n\"How do you think things will go in Congress today?\" Hall asked\r\nFernandez.\r\n\r\n\"The same as every year, Senor Hall. Ceremonials, the speech, and\r\nthen--_quien sabe_?\"\r\n\r\nRumors rose from the table. Everyone had a choice rumor to air. Rios had\r\nit on good authority that Tabio's illness was merely a pretext; the\r\nPresident was afraid to face the Congress lest they force him to justify\r\nhis wild socialistic measures which had put the national budget in such\r\ndire peril. Orville Smith informed the men at the table that Tabio's\r\nillness had taken a more serious turn. \"In fact, I understand that Dr.\r\nAnsaldo has informed the government that he will refuse to operate on\r\nTabio without the written permission of the Cabinet.\" Fernandez spoke of\r\nAnsaldo's skill as a surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"How about Gamburdo's speech, Joe?\" the Ambassador said. \"You promised\r\nto bring me an advance copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told my secretary to bring it to you as soon as it arrived,\"\r\nFernandez answered. \"It is very late in arriving today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea of what he is going to say, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a very sound man,\" Fernandez said. \"I am sure that the speech\r\nwill be satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't call for the nationalization of the mines, at any rate,\" Smith\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nHe made the mistake of translating his remark for Joaquin Rios. He might\r\njust as well have dropped a match into a keg of gunpowder. The wax\r\nmustaches under the purpling nose of ex-Senator Rios began quivering\r\neven before he unleashed an avalanche of ringing livid paragraphs on the\r\nsubject. His eyes blind to the cold stares of Jose Fernandez, he\r\nunlimbered his heaviest verbal artillery, pounded the table until the\r\nglasses rattled, pointed accusing fingers at every corner of the room,\r\nand otherwise managed rather effectively to end the luncheon. Fernandez\r\nfairly had to drag him out of the Embassy to cool him down.\r\n\r\n\"Fine fellows,\" Skidmore said to Hall when they were gone. \"Best of the\r\nlot down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Hall said. \"I've known all about Fernandez for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a great guy, Hall. Publishes one of the best newspapers on the\r\ncontinent. As a matter of cold fact, old man, I wouldn't be at all\r\nsurprised if he won the--well, he might be in for a rather high honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. The Cabot Prize.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you?\"\r\n\r\nHall looked at Smith, who was growing uncomfortable. \"I can't remember,\"\r\nhe said. \"But it's hard to keep such a secret in San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" the Ambassador laughed. \"It was nice to see you\r\nagain, old man. Drop in any time when you have a problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Problems in San Hermano? Things seem to be pretty much under control,\r\nI'd say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the Ambassador admitted. \"Things are pretty quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it be as quiet when Tabio dies? I heard talk that the Gamburdo\r\ncrowd is pretty close to the fascists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo?\" Skidmore grew both amused and indignant. \"What kind of\r\ncommunistic nonsense have you been hearing? I know Eduardo Gamburdo\r\nintimately. I've entertained him at the Embassy, and I've week-ended at\r\nhis estate. He's a fine conservative influence on this government and,\r\ndamn it all, young man, Gamburdo is a thorough gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hall said. \"Thorough.\" For a few seconds, during the luncheon,\r\nhe had toyed with the idea of telling the Ambassador all that he knew\r\nabout Gamburdo and Ansaldo and the role of the Falange. Now he cursed\r\nhimself for a fool. Skidmore, he saw, was Orville Smith at sixty, but\r\nwith the power to make trouble for any visiting American who rubbed\r\nagainst his deep-set prejudices. \"Well, thanks for everything,\" he said.\r\n\"I guess you're pretty busy today.\"\r\n\r\nHall rushed out of the Embassy, his face twitching crazily as he charged\r\ndown the marble walk to the curb. He had broken into a heavy sweat which\r\ndrenched him from head to toe. \"Get me out of here,\" he roared at Pepe.\r\n\"Get going before I kill someone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" Pepe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Where are we going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere. What's the matter with your face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\" He put his hand against his right cheek. \"Nothing. Did you\r\nsee Gonzales?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gave him the letter. He said you should go to the opening of Congress\r\ntoday. He says you might be surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. I had my surprise for the day already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gonzales was serious. He says you should go. It starts at four\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll go. Better take me to Gobernacion. I'll need a pass\r\nfrom the Press Bureau. No, wait, let's go to Duarte's place. He takes\r\nhis siesta at this time. I'll call that Vardieno bitch from his place.\"\r\n\r\nHall opened his tie. \"Have we time to stop for a beer?\" he asked. \"I'm\r\ndying for a drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We might miss Duarte. He'll have beer for you.\"\r\n\r\nPepe was right. Duarte did have beer, and had they stopped on the way,\r\nthey would have missed him. He was about to leave the house when they\r\narrived. Duarte was wearing the green dress uniform of a Mexican\r\nlieutenant-colonel, to which he had pinned his Spanish medals and\r\ninsignia.\r\n\r\n\"Going to war?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. To the opening of Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hall is dying,\" Pepe said. \"He needs cold beer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mexican brought out five bottles of beer. \"I've got more in the ice\r\nbox,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants to kill someone,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"Me too. What of it?\"\r\n\r\nHall put the mouth of the opened bottle to his lips, tilted his head\r\nback. \"God,\" he said, \"Pepe is right. Let me make one phone call, and\r\nthen I'll spill it. I've got to get it off my chest before I blow the\r\ntop.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached the Vardieno girl on the phone. She was so sorry. The lists\r\nhad all gone down to the Hall of Congress. Anyway, all requests for\r\nforeign writers had to come through their embassies. That was the Press\r\nChief's new ruling.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine. That settles it,\" Hall said when he put the phone away.\r\n\"Now I must ask the Ambassador to approve me for the press gallery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Mateo,\" Duarte said. \"I can wait a full hour if necessary.\"\r\nHe put a bottle of cold beer into Hall's hand. \"Tell us about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait outside,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"No. Stay with us, Pepe. I want you to know the facts. Do you both\r\nremember that I was waiting for a letter from Havana? Well, I got it.\r\nTwo letters, in fact. They told me what I wanted to know about Ansaldo.\"\r\nHe drained the second bottle and then told them what had happened to him\r\nat the Embassy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother with him,\" Duarte said. \"You don't need his permission.\r\nI'll give you my diplomatic invitation and my carnet. The uniform is all\r\nI need to get through the gates. You'll sit in the diplomatic gallery\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can even act as Skidmore's interpreter.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Con mucho gusto!_\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRiding to the Hall of Congress, Duarte drew Hall's attention to the loud\r\nspeakers fastened to the poles in every plaza. \"The government has\r\nbought over a hundred speakers in the past two weeks,\" he said. \"I know,\r\nbecause most of them were bought in California and I had to O.K. their\r\ntransit duty-free through Mexico. I think our friend Gamburdo is up to\r\nsomething today.\"\r\n\r\nHall looked at a knot of grim-faced _Hermanitos_ standing under one of\r\nthe speakers. \"I think the people suspect it too.\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't get an advance copy of the speech at the Embassy, Mateo.\r\nUsually, Tabio releases advance copies to the press and the diplomatic\r\ncorps on the morning of the speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only suspect the worst. After the speech, can you come back to\r\nthe house with me? I want to hear what happened to you. Commander New\r\ncalled me this morning and told me that he had asked the police to\r\ninvestigate Fielding's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? On the phone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the damned idiot! Now even if the police are not fixed every damned\r\nfascist in South America knows that the Fielding thing went wrong!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's too late for cursing now. Let's talk about the whole picture after\r\nthe speech.\"\r\n\r\nThe plaza facing the Hall of Congress was filling up with citizens who\r\nhad come to hear the speech over the public-address system. Scattered\r\nthrough the crowds were men carrying signs reading \"_Viva_ Eduardo\r\nGamburdo.\" Duarte pointed them out.\r\n\r\n\"Every one a Cross-and-Sword ruffian,\" he said. \"I used to see the same\r\nfaces while the Falange was legal. They then wore the blue shirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see their faces,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen their faces. Three months ago Lombardo came to San Hermano to\r\naddress the C.T.A.L. convention. The same gang showed up with their\r\nfilthy signs, only this time the signs read: '_Viva_ Christ the King'\r\nand 'Go back to Bolshevik Mexico, you Dirty Jew' and 'Down with the\r\nCommune of the anti-Christ' and other lovely things. I know them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something is happening,\" Duarte said when they were in the building.\r\n\"Everyone is too quiet.\" They followed a military escort to the Mexican\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Ambassador was tense. \"I don't like it,\" he said to Hall and\r\nDuarte. \"Why is everyone so quiet on the rostrum?\"\r\n\r\n\"They look as if they've seen a ghost,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nDuarte studied the faces of the officials on the flag-decked rostrum.\r\n\"Where's Gamburdo?\" he said. \"Has anyone seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw his car parked outside when I came in,\" the Ambassador said.\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Do you hear it, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like distant thunder, Felipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not thunder. It's the crowd. What have they got to cheer about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo's cheer leaders must have gone to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" the Mexican Ambassador said. \"I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\nA gavel fell on a block. At a signal from the President of the Senate, a\r\nmilitary band hidden in one of the caucus rooms began to play the\r\nnational anthem. The music was piped in to the great hall over the\r\npublic-address system.\r\n\r\nThe gavel called the Congress to order. A clerk called the roll, the\r\nSenate head started the parliamentary ritual. Then the band started to\r\nplay the national anthem again, this time without a signal. A door\r\nbehind the rostrum opened.\r\n\r\nIn the doorway, flanked by his two young sons, Anibal Tabio sat in a\r\nwheel chair. His closest friend, Esteban Lavandero, the Minister of\r\nEducation, stood behind him. Slowly, the chair was wheeled to the\r\nrostrum.\r\n\r\n\"Members of the Congress,\" the Senate Chief shouted, \"The President of\r\nthe nation has come to deliver his annual address.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter ten_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two shouts. On the floor, one of the Senators screamed \"_Viva\r\nLa Republica!_\" At the same moment a young voice in the press gallery\r\nyelled, \"_Viva_ Don Anibal Tabio!\" and in the great hall every man\r\nsprang to his feet. The low distant thunder of the crowds in the Plaza\r\nhad now swelled to a roar whose joyous overtones poured into the Hall of\r\nCongress through the doors, the windows, the steel and marble walls\r\nthemselves. Senators and Deputies of the Popular Front Parties were the\r\nfirst in the hall to find their voices. \"_Viva_ Don Anibal!\" they\r\nshouted, applauding wildly, laughing, yelling, embracing one another,\r\nwondering if the tears in their eyes could be seen by their colleagues.\r\nThe anti-Tabio Congressmen remained on their feet, their hands moving in\r\nthe motions of applause, their hearts cold and sick. Somehow, Eduardo\r\nGamburdo had found his former place on the rostrum, was now standing and\r\napplauding with the other people in the hall. The signals had been\r\ncrossed. The dead President had come to life. Anibal Tabio was sitting\r\nbefore the chromium microphone, serene and unmoving, his paralyzed legs\r\nneatly covered with a light Indian blanket.\r\n\r\nOutside, the crowd had begun to sing the national anthem. The\r\nlegislators, the reporters, many of the Latin American diplomats in the\r\nvisitors' gallery took up the words. Hall glanced at his neighbors.\r\nTears flowed down the cheeks of Duarte and his chief. A few rows away,\r\nSkidmore and Orville Smith, correctly dressed in formal afternoon wear,\r\nstood stiffly at attention, their eyes firmly riveted to the strange\r\ntableau of Tabio and his entourage.\r\n\r\nSomeone thrust a huge bouquet of orange and blue mountain flowers at the\r\ninvalid in the wheel chair. His son Diego accepted the flowers, laid\r\nthem tenderly on an empty chair. Diego at fifteen was heavier than his\r\nfather had ever been, darker, more like an Indian peasant than the son\r\nof Anibal Tabio. His brother Simon, who now accepted the second bouquet,\r\nwas an eighteen-year-old replica of Don Anibal himself. Tall, lithe, he\r\nhad the same fair brown hair, the same thin spiritual face as the\r\nfather. Lavandero, standing behind Tabio's chair, had the dark, brooding\r\nface of a Moor. His shock of black hair started at the peak of a high,\r\nbroad forehead; his large black mustache failed to dominate his thick,\r\nstrong lips. He was rubbing a hairy fist in his eyes and talking softly\r\nto Tabio.\r\n\r\nThe President, at fifty-three, seemed to have aged ten years since Hall\r\nhad last seen him. His hair had turned gray, and everything about him\r\nwas thinner than ever before in his life. In Geneva, Hall had always\r\nwondered what would have happened to the thin, delicate frame of Anibal\r\nTabio in a tropical hurricane. Now, even from the gallery, Hall could\r\nsee that Tabio had grown so thin that the high cheek bones which had\r\nalways marked his slender face now stuck out like two sharp points,\r\nalmost burying the deep-set gray eyes. Tabio sat quietly in his wheel\r\nchair, smiling at friends on the floor, looking first to Diego then to\r\nSimon, gently patting the hand of his older son when the boy put his\r\nhand on the father's fragile shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe ovation continued when the singing of the national anthem was\r\ncompleted. Tabio turned to Lavandero, whispered a few words. The\r\nMinister of Education held his hands, palms out, toward the assemblage.\r\n\"Please,\" he said. \"Please.\"\r\n\r\nGuests and legislators took their seats. In another room, a drummer\r\ndropped his cymbal on the floor. It rent the sudden silence of the great\r\nhall, and then its echoes were stilled.\r\n\r\nAnibal Tabio squeezed the hands of his sons, drew a deep breath, and\r\nfaced the microphone before him.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen,\" he said, \"this is the third year in which I have had\r\nthe honor of addressing you at this solemn hour. A week ago, I would\r\nhave said that my chances of preaching my own funeral sermon were better\r\nthan my chances of opening this, the fifteenth free Congress of our\r\nbeloved Republic.\r\n\r\n\"But since then ...\" he leaned forward, his long chin jutting\r\npugnaciously forward as he gasped for breath, \"since then many things\r\nhave come to my ears. I have heard rumors. Strange and disturbing rumors\r\nabout what was going to happen today. I need not repeat these rumors to\r\nyou. You have all heard them.\"\r\n\r\nHall looked at Skidmore's face as Smith translated Tabio's words.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have heard them. When they came to my ears,\" Tabio said, \"I\r\nthought: What is happening? Who dares to challenge the mandate of the\r\npeople? Who dares to speak of perverting the will of the people? It was\r\nthen that I knew, as never before, that a President's place is with the\r\npeople. If I could sit up in my bed and talk this way to my sons, to my\r\ndear friend Esteban Lavandero, then I could sit up in this chair before\r\nyou, the chosen representatives of the people.\r\n\r\n\"My good friends, this may be the last time I will ever speak to\r\nyou ...\"\r\n\r\nShouts of \"No!\" rang all over the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Hear me, friends. Hear me and mark well what I say. Once this nation\r\nhonored me with the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. As your\r\nMinister, I crossed the ocean. I went to Geneva. I went to Spain, from\r\nwhere we have derived so much of our culture, our language, so much of\r\nour personality as a people.\r\n\r\n\"We are today a free people, not the colonial vassals we were in the\r\ndays of Imperial Spain. But Spain, too, had become a free nation in\r\n1931. I saw the free Spain at the hour of her birth, when the hated\r\nBourbon heard the voice of Spain's millions at the ballot and fled to\r\nthe empty pleasures of a decaying society abroad. I also saw the free\r\nSpain in the hours of her agony. It was at that hour that I beheld for\r\nthe first time the ugly bloodless face of fascism.\r\n\r\n\"It is a cold, metallic, impersonal face, my countrymen, the face of an\r\nAgusto Segura grown to superhuman power, the maniacal face of a mad\r\nkiller who suddenly finds all the world's horrible instruments of\r\ndestruction in his idiot hands. I saw this beast grow strong on the\r\nblood of free men, and I wept for a gallant people who, for a few brief\r\nmoments, had presumed to control their own destinies.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Tabio said, his hand pointing across an ocean, \"yes, I wept for\r\nSpain, but through my tears I began to see my own native land, saw my\r\nown people enjoying this precious freedom. And at that moment I knew\r\nthat I must dedicate whatever remained of my life to doing all that was\r\nin my power as a man and as a citizen to keep the beast of fascism from\r\ngorging on our young Republic.\r\n\r\n\"I have fought that fight to this very moment. But more important than\r\nanything I have done has been the magnificent unity of our peoples in\r\ntheir determination to struggle against fascism in all of its black\r\nforms. It has not been the President who has led the people in this\r\ngreat crusade. No, my countrymen. It has been the people who have\r\ncreated and given their mandate to the President, to the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nTabio had never learned a single orator's trick. As a statesman, he\r\nretained all the speaking habits he had originally formed during his\r\nearly years as a young professor of history at the university. Teaching,\r\nhe once explained, was the process of thinking aloud. And at this\r\nmoment, in what he guessed would be his last speech to the nation,\r\nAnibal Tabio returned to the concepts which had gone into his great book\r\non the relationships of people to government in modern democracy. For\r\nthe better part of thirty minutes, he explored these relationships\r\nagain. After all these years, the professor was back in class, patiently\r\nexpounding his ideas to a new set of faces.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is the state and the people. I have not told you anything\r\nnew. You have heard this all before from me.\" Tabio was laughing softly,\r\nand at himself. \"But that is what happens when the people elect a\r\npedantic professor as their President. Instead of a speech, they get a\r\nlong, dry lecture.\"\r\n\r\nTabio paused, frowned at the people who sat hushed in the hall. \"Have\r\nyou forgotten how to laugh?\" he asked. A few loyal followers tried to\r\nlaugh. \"Good,\" Tabio said.\r\n\r\n\"But I am not finished, my countrymen. I have spoken of the ideal\r\ndemocratic state. Many of us like to feel that we have achieved this\r\nstate. That perfection is ours. This is dangerous thinking. Of course,\r\nwe are not as imperfect as a certain newspaper in San Hermano and a\r\ncertain organization which has usurped the symbol of brotherly love as\r\nits emblem\"--this time he drew some real laughter--\"we are not as\r\nimperfect as they would have you believe.\r\n\r\n\"But even if we were the most perfect state in the world, today this\r\nwould mean very little. Our chances of surviving, of progressing until\r\nthe Republic of Man became even more attractive than the Kingdom of God,\r\nour chances of surviving at all would still be obscured. If our nation\r\nwere some remote island in the skies, whirling on its own axis, remote\r\nfrom all other lands, perhaps then I would have no fears for our future.\r\n\r\n\"We are not this remote planet unto ourselves. We share a world with a\r\nhundred nations, a thousand races. I do not regret that we are part of\r\nthis world. I think we should rejoice in our membership in the world's\r\nfamily of races. But we must not lose sight of the fact that our nation,\r\nno less than any other nation, be it free or fascist, is part of this\r\nstrange family.\r\n\r\n\"We must never forget that the great war which started in unhappy Spain\r\nin July, 1936, was not a war between good and evil in Spain alone. It\r\nwas a war not of two Spanish ideas but of two fundamental world ideas.\r\nIt was the start of the universal death struggle between the slave-world\r\nideas of fascism and the free-world ideas of political and economic\r\ndemocracy. It was the start of the fascist war against freedom that has\r\nnow spread all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nTabio glanced at his two sons. He accepted a glass of water, smiling at\r\nthe legislators in the front rows as he drank. \"Freedom,\" he said, \"is\r\nthere a man who does not know the meaning of the word?\" Before he\r\nreturned to the theme of the world war which had started in Spain, he\r\nexplored the full meaning of freedom in modern times. It was only after\r\nhe had delivered a profound essay on freedom which shook Matthew Hall\r\nuntil the American felt a lump rising in his throat that Tabio picked up\r\nthe earlier threads.\r\n\r\n\"In Spain, then, the forces of freedom suffered a heavy loss. But what\r\nof those small men with narrow little minds who held the reins of so\r\nmuch of the world's power while Spain bled? What of these tiny\r\nstatesmen, these sleek somnambulists who held lace handkerchiefs before\r\ntheir narrow mouths and laughed while fascism marched in Spain? What of\r\nthese wretches who, through the immoral instrument called\r\nnon-intervention, sought to end freedom in Spain in the criminal\r\nconviction that the blood of Spain alone would satisfy the fascist\r\nbeast?\r\n\r\n\"History was not long in giving the lie to these gentry. The beast who\r\nhad whetted his insatiable appetite in Spain now started almost\r\nimmediately to claw at the world. It was in April of 1939 that Madrid\r\nfell. By September the beast belched and turned on the very creatures\r\nwho had covertly and overtly helped him subdue Spain.\"\r\n\r\nThat Tabio had not raised his voice at this point, that he in fact spoke\r\nmore softly, accentuated all the more the scorn and the anger in his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Nations have fallen to the beast,\" he continued. \"Nations of meager\r\nfreedom, like Poland. Nations of great and traditional freedom, like\r\nFrance. The war has spread over the world like a Biblical plague. Russia\r\ncould not escape it. Nor could our great sister Republic, the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, North Americans now have felt the pain, the anguish, the power of\r\nAxis treachery. No nation can escape this war.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, we are not an island in the skies. We are a sovereign\r\nnation in the same world, on the same earth, in the same waters, sharing\r\nthe same era as the United States, England, Russia and China. It is not\r\nfor us to choose whether or not we can stay out of this war. That choice\r\nthe world does not permit us. Our only choice is the determination of\r\nwhat our role must be in this war.\r\n\r\n\"There has been strange talk in our land lately. There has been strange\r\nand deceitful talk of neutrality. Has it not occurred to any of you that\r\nthose in our midst who howl the loudest for neutrality, who show such a\r\nsudden concern for the lives and safety of the humblest Indian peasant,\r\nthat these pious seekers after neutrality have never before worn the\r\nwhite dove on their family escutcheons? Who are these peaceful gentlemen\r\nwho grow pale in the presence of bloodshed? Are they not the same\r\npersons who as young men were proud to be officers in the armies of\r\nSegura, who laughed and drank as they ruthlessly shot down defenseless\r\nminers in the northern provinces?\r\n\r\n\"Who are these sudden pacifists in our Republic? Are they not the very\r\ndevout gentlemen who sent money and rum and cigars to the fascists in\r\nSpain during the Spanish phase of this war? Are they not the very men\r\nwho sent cables of homage to Hitler and Mussolini after the shame of\r\nMunich? Are they not the very men who even now wear the medals of Nazi\r\nGermany, of Blackshirt Italy, of Falangist Spain--who wear these medals\r\nproudly while they chortle over the blood of dying Russians on the\r\nEastern Front, of dying Americans on the Bataan peninsula?\"\r\n\r\nTabio stopped. His eyes searched the press gallery, then fixed on Jose\r\nFernandez. He pointed a graceful hand at the publisher of _El\r\nImparcial_.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you,\" he said, \"are they not the very men who write in their\r\npapers that Adolf Hitler, whatever be his alleged faults, is waging a\r\nholy crusade on behalf of Christian civilization against Marxist\r\natheism?\"\r\n\r\nTabio continued looking at Fernandez, but Lavandero shot a fierce scowl\r\nat Ambassador Skidmore, who seemed bewildered and unhappy as Smith\r\ntranslated Tabio's questions. The Ambassador, too, had seen the object\r\nof Tabio's shaft. Angry, uneasy laughter broke out on the floor. A cry\r\nof \"Long live the United Nations!\" from one of the Popular Front\r\ndeputies was immediately answered with the shout \"Long live Christ the\r\nKing\" from the public gallery.\r\n\r\nThe President, who had heard both shouts, turned to the gallery. \"Who\r\nare these neutrals?\" he asked. \"Are they not the same fascists who hope\r\nto fool God by casting their fascist swords in the image of the Cross of\r\nJesus? Are they not the fanatics who, rather than see the Axis beast\r\ndestroyed, would first destroy the freedom and the dignity of their own\r\nland?\r\n\r\n\"They lie. There can be no neutrals in this world war. He who calls\r\nhimself a neutral is either a fool or a fascist. And the fine gentlemen\r\nwho prate of neutrality are very clever men.\"\r\n\r\nThe Popular Front Congressmen rose to their feet, applauding and adding\r\nto the din with their shouts of agreement. They were joined by a few of\r\nthe independents. The delegates of the rightist coalition remained in\r\ntheir seats, their arms folded across their chests. But they were not\r\nquiet. As the ovation for Tabio continued, loud cries came from the\r\nranks of the men who kept their seats. \"Down with atheism!\" shouted one\r\nrightist Senator. \"We have no quarrel with any other nation!\" another\r\nyelled. \"We will not die for Godless Russia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live democracy!\" a Popular Front deputy answered. \"Long live the\r\nanti-fascist United Nations!\"\r\n\r\nEsteban Lavandero pleaded with the Congress for silence.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen,\" Tabio said, \"there can be no neutrality in this war.\r\nThere is one official neutral in Europe. His name is Francisco Franco.\r\nWe all know what this hypocritical neutrality really is; how it shields\r\nthe vile aid that fascist Spain is lending to the Axis. But this is as\r\nit should be. Franco is a fascist, and today fascism must triumph all\r\nover the world or be crushed forever.\r\n\r\n\"But what of our own nation, what of the twenty nations of Hispanic\r\nAmerica in this war? What is our stake in this world struggle?\r\n\r\n\"If the Axis wins this war, we, like all other nations, must of\r\nnecessity lose our political freedom. And if we once lose our political\r\ndemocracy, we must begin again the long, bitter struggle to win it once\r\nmore before we can even begin to dream of creating an era of economic\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\"If the United Nations win, if world fascism is crushed forever, a new\r\nworld era of economic democracy must begin at once. It will not come\r\neasily. The defeat of the Axis will not immediately bring in its wake\r\nthe millennium. It will, however, give the common people of the world\r\nthe final realization of their great power. In this lies the inherent\r\nstrength of political democracy. For democracy is not a static thing. It\r\ncan grow and bring in the era of economic democracy, or it can falter\r\nand give way to fascism.\r\n\r\n\"The common people of the world, today fighting and dying behind the\r\nbanners of the United Nations, have served notice on history that they\r\nwill not rest until fascism has been swept from the face of this earth.\"\r\n\r\nTabio was now speaking with both arms raised, his hands reaching out to\r\neveryone. \"My countrymen, I have said enough. I know that I have spoken\r\nthe thoughts that are uppermost in the minds of that great majority of\r\nour citizens who have given their mandate to you and to me. In a week,\r\nyou will have to frame the mandate for the delegation which will speak\r\nfor our Republic at the forthcoming conference of the nations of the\r\nAmericas. Speak out! Speak out honestly, speak out openly. Speak as the\r\nspokesmen of a democracy. Speak as the citizens of the embattled united\r\ndemocracies of the entire world must speak at this hour. Speak for the\r\nfree men of the free world. Speak firmly, for you will be speaking not\r\nonly for the future of our own Republic but for the future of all\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cuban Ambassador, whose seat was nearest the podium, crossed the\r\nplush rail and rushed to Tabio's wheel chair. He fell to his knees,\r\nembraced the President. In a flash, Eduardo Gamburdo left his own place\r\nand copied the Cuban's gesture. The rostrum became crowded with\r\ndignitaries bent on paying the same homage to Anibal Tabio. The envoys\r\nof the Latin American democracies, the delegates of the Free French and\r\nthe Spanish Republican juntas, the leaders of the trade unions and the\r\nchiefs of the Popular Front parties milled around the wheel chair as the\r\npro-democrats in the hall added their voices to the cheers of the crowds\r\nin the Plaza. Duarte, his soft raspy words choked and unintelligible,\r\nembraced Hall.\r\n\r\nLavandero was pulling the wheel chair back toward the door of the\r\nSpeaker's Chamber. The well-wishers of the President followed him into\r\nthe room. For a moment, the people in the auditorium applauded the blank\r\ndoor through which Tabio had vanished. Then young Simon Tabio returned\r\nto pick up the flowers on the chair, and his father's supporters cheered\r\nlouder, punctuating their cheers with cries of \"Long live Don Anibal!\"\r\nThe youth streaked into the room behind the platform.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to go to my office,\" Duarte said. \"I have to prepare a report\r\non the speech. Join me, and then we can talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pepe can drive us over.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one drives today,\" Duarte said when they reached the visitors'\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nThe streets were jammed thick with people. Hall had never seen so many\r\npeople in San Hermano before. It was as if every house, every building\r\nin the university, every shop, every wharf, every school had been turned\r\ninside out and its people poured out into the streets. Whole families in\r\ntheir best clothes, trolley drivers in their work uniforms, longshoremen\r\nin their dungarees, even peasants from the other side of Monte Azul in\r\ntheir brown-cotton trousers and their broad-brimmed straw hats milled\r\nalong the sidewalks, the pavements, the Plaza, the trolley tracks. Cars,\r\ntaxis, trucks, wagons, trolleys were parked crazily all over the place.\r\n\r\nPepe, like a hundred other drivers within a block of the Hall of\r\nCongress, was standing on top of his car, waving the flag of the\r\nRepublic, shouting, \"Long live the United Nations! Long live Don Anibal!\r\nLong live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nCrowds formed around each parked vehicle, joined the cries of the\r\ndrivers. The roofs of the trolleys were jammed with groups of students\r\nand motormen waving flags or the banners of their student societies and\r\ntheir unions. Thousands of Hermanitos, kids in overalls, housewives,\r\nlawyers, shopkeepers wandered through the crowds with framed portraits\r\nof Anibal Tabio which an hour ago had hung from the walls of their\r\nhomes, their offices, their shops. The pictures of Tabio ranged from\r\nformal photographs and oil paintings to crude charcoal drawings and\r\npictures torn from the daily press.\r\n\r\nHall and Duarte made their way to Pepe's sedan. When he saw them, he put\r\nthe flag in his left hand and with his right hand he pointed to\r\nsomething on the ground on the opposite side of the car. \"Look!\" Pepe\r\nshouted. \"Down here!\"\r\n\r\nA pile of torn Cross-and-Sword placards lay on the cobbles inside a ring\r\nof laughing young Hermanitos who were urinating on the signs. Some of\r\nthe boys in this ring showed signs of having been in a fight.\r\n\r\n\"The fascists ran away,\" Pepe laughed. \"Don Anibal's speech split their\r\nfilthy ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you later,\" Hall told Pepe.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Pepe shouted. He leaned over the side of his cab. \"Boy,\" he\r\nsaid, \"boy, where is that flag for the American _companero_? That's the\r\none. Thank you, boy.\" He lay down on his belly, stretched a huge paw\r\ninto the crowd around the remains of the Cross-and-Sword banners. When\r\nhe stood up, he had a small American flag in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Hall said, taking the flag. \"I guess it's also the Yankee\r\nday to howl.\"\r\n\r\nA crowd formed around Hall and Duarte. They saluted the American flag,\r\nsaluted the Mexican uniform.\r\n\r\n\"Long live the United States! Long live Mexico!\" the crowd shouted, and\r\nthe two men answered, as one, \"Long live Don Anibal!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd separated, let them through. They walked a few steps, and then\r\nanother crowd formed around them. Again they listened to cheers for the\r\nUnited States and Mexico, again they responded with their cheer for\r\nTabio.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus H. Christ,\" Hall said. \"This is the first time I've carried an\r\nAmerican flag in the streets since I was a Boy Scout in Ohio.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do you good, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like it. But try to make anyone believe it back home!\"\r\n\r\nAt the fourth block Hall and Duarte started to detour around a trolley\r\ncar which had stopped in the middle of a crossing. A dozen hands reached\r\ndown from the crowded roof. \"_Companeros!_ Take our hands! Climb up!\r\nTake our hands! We want a speech!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live Mexico! Homage to Colonel Felipe Duarte, Counselor of the\r\nMexican Embassy and hero of the war against the fascists in Spain!\"\r\n\r\nDuarte had to join the crowd on the roof of the stalled train. He made a\r\nshort speech about Mexico, Republican Spain, and the greatness of Anibal\r\nTabio.\r\n\r\nTwo more blocks of happy, cheering Hermanitos. Vivas, salutes for the\r\nAmerican flag and the Mexican uniform. Men in dungarees and heavy shoes\r\nsaluting the flag and the uniform with clenched fists. Young women and\r\nold men who embraced Hall and Duarte. Even an ancient with a\r\nnicotine-yellowed white beard, who wiggled out of one crowd, tore the\r\nflag out of Hall's hand, kissed it, and then handed it back to the\r\nAmerican with an embrace and a viva for Voodro Veelson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were relaxing over a beer in Duarte's office when the explosion\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Hall cried.\r\n\r\nThere were two explosions. A little one, like the crack of a distant\r\nartillery piece in the mountains and then a louder, deep-toned whoosh of\r\na noise. They had both heard such noises before.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that noise, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\nHall was on his feet. \"Do I! Only one thing makes a noise like that,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Direct hit on a gasoline tank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were washing, the sun had begun to set. Now a new sun had\r\nrisen in the skies of San Hermano, risen at a point about a mile north\r\nof the Embassy. A great sheet of flame had shot from the ground,\r\nstabbing at the purpling skies, straining to leap clear of the round\r\nheavy blobs of black smoke which rose from the same place and surged\r\nover and around the fires.\r\n\r\nThe streets were more crowded than they had been when Hall and Tabio\r\nleft the Congress. New signs had been added to the placards and\r\nportraits of Tabio which the people carried. Tremendous sketches and\r\nblown-up photos of Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek,\r\nnailed to frames with handles for two men, bobbed over the heads of the\r\ncrowds. Duarte, from the balcony, asked the people on the street what\r\nhad happened. They thought it was a victory bonfire.\r\n\r\n\"The hell it is, Felipe. Let's see for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must stay and write my cable. You go and then come back here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you lend me a car and a chauffeur?\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't drive a car through these crowds. You'll have to walk.\r\nLeave through the back way. It opens on a narrow street leading to the\r\nAvenida de la Liberacion. You'll save time.\"\r\n\r\nHall found the narrow street deserted. He set out at a fast pace, his\r\neyes on the flames and the increasingly heavy puffs of smoke. The shouts\r\nof the crowds on the broad avenues and the plazas followed him up the\r\nsmall street. Over the cries of the Hermanitos came the wail of the\r\nsirens, the clamor of the bells on the American fire engines the city\r\nhad purchased a few years back.\r\n\r\nThe crowd half-pushed, half-guided Hall to the entrance of the Ritz. He\r\nducked into the lobby to catch his breath, bought some cigars at the\r\nstand, lit one, and then decided to have a quick drink.\r\n\r\nMargaret Skidmore was at the bar with Giselle Prescott and a young man\r\nHall had met at the Embassy ball. The Prescott woman was wearing an\r\nimmense wheel of a white hat. She was very drunk.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Reds blew up a church,\" Margaret said. \"How are you, Matt? I heard\r\nthat you were out on a monumental bender. Too many women?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much alcohol.\" Then, to the man with the girls, \"Didn't we meet at\r\nthe Embassy party? My name is Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the Marques de Runa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spanish?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret answered for him. \"No. Not exactly. The family had the title\r\nrevalidated in 1930.\"\r\n\r\nGiselle Prescott shuddered over an emptied glass. She whispered\r\nsomething about rum, romanism and rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"What's eating her?\" Hall asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Gin and communism. She's allergic to burning churches.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father phoned the governor of our province and demanded soldiers to\r\nprotect the family estates,\" the young Marques said. \"It is scandalous.\r\nWe hear that they've already raped a nun and killed two priests. My\r\nfather says that if El Tovarich ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Who saw the church burning?\" Hall interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of you?\"\r\n\r\nSilence. \"Any of you?\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"It was anarchy,\" the Marques said. \"When El Tovarich started to rant in\r\nCongress today the Reds swarmed into the city from the wharves. They\r\ntore a religious poster from my cousin's arms and beat him within an\r\ninch of his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a fact?\" Hall was staring at the gold emblem of the Cross and\r\nSword in the Marques' lapel. \"That's too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see what I meant,\" Margaret said. \"Now you understand me, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Now I understand. How about you, Giselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"What about me? I'm filing for the WP today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd better come with me. I'm going to have a look at this\r\nburning church. Might be good color stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don' wanna look,\" she said. \"Gives me hives. Besides, I know all\r\nabout it anyway.\"\r\n\r\nHall put his arm through Margaret's. \"Let's you and me look, then,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go!\" the Marques cried. \"You're both dressed too well. They'll\r\nkill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd better not go with you, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I insist. I'm going and you're coming with me.\"\r\n\r\nThey watched de Runa stiffen. \"Now don't be a child,\" she said. \"Hall\r\nwill bring me back intact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go,\" the Marques said.\r\n\r\nHall freed his hands. For a moment he thought he would have to use them\r\non the Marques. Then Margaret tugged his arm. \"Let's go if we're going,\"\r\nshe said. \"You wait right here for me with Giselle, Freddie. I'll meet\r\nyou here in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire was five blocks from the Ritz. There was a half block heap of\r\nglowing brick and rubble. Behind the rubble stood an old church, one\r\nwall partially blown out. The firemen were playing streams of water into\r\nand around this hole.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" Margaret said. \"The stench!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oil. My guess is that a thousand gallons of oil went up in smoke.\"\r\n\r\nIn the crowd standing at the rim of the fire lines, a taxi driver turned\r\naround and glanced at Hall. \"Some fire,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Garage. The Phoenix Garage went up in smoke. Blew a hole in the\r\nCathedral when it exploded.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Phoenix Garage?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what it is, senor.\" The driver moved closer to the gutted\r\nrubble.\r\n\r\n\"You wait here, Margaret. I'm going to talk to the firemen.\" He crossed\r\nthe fire lines, found his way to the engine captain near the main\r\nhydrant. When he returned to Margaret, he gave her a complete report.\r\n\"The fire chiefs say that the Reds didn't blow up the church at all,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Seems as if the gasoline tanks in the garage caught fire by\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed. \"Don't tell Gis,\" she said. \"She's already cabled a\r\nstory to the States that the Reds burned the church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter eleven_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuarte knew about the Phoenix Garage before Hall returned to the Mexican\r\nEmbassy. \"Commander New dropped in while you were at the fire,\" he\r\nexplained. \"He told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know anything else about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not about the fire. But he does know a little more about Fielding. He\r\nsays that Fielding's files have been cleaned out. There wasn't a single\r\ncopy of any of Fielding's reports when the British officials opened the\r\nfiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the British have all the dope, Felipe. Fielding's reports--at least\r\nthe ones he showed me--were all carbons of the reports he made to his\r\nEmbassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that. But if his reports are now in the hands of the Falange,\r\nthe Axis knows it too. It will give them time to cover their traces. It\r\nwill also put the finger on you. One of the things they did find in the\r\noffice was a note Fielding had made reminding himself to prepare copies\r\nof certain reports for you, Mateo. That might explain what happened to\r\nyou in that Falangist cafe on the waterfront the other day. Fielding had\r\nalready been killed when you were drugged.\"\r\n\r\nHall lay down on the couch in Duarte's office, took his shoes off. \"I'll\r\nbe all right in a few minutes,\" he said. \"I just need about ten minutes\r\nof this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get some cold beer.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I don't need it. Listen, Felipe, do the British know that I was\r\ndrugged?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so. I didn't tell them, anyway. I wouldn't, without your\r\npermission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you should tell them. It might do some good. But what are we\r\ngoing to do now that we know about the fire? I still feel like a drunk\r\non a merry-go-round.\"\r\n\r\nDuarte laughed. \"You can always get off and go home,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No. It feels worse when I get off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did something this morning, Mateo. I sent word to General Mogrado\r\nthrough one of our diplomatic couriers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mogrado? Of the Spanish air force?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's living in Mexico City now. I asked him to rush everything he could\r\nget on Ansaldo. The largest Spanish Republican colony in the hemisphere\r\nis in Mexico, you know. I figured that surely there must be one man\r\namong the exiles--a doctor, a former Army officer, someone--who could\r\ngive us the dope on Ansaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a possibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let me fall asleep here. I've got things to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then get some rest. I've got to complete my report.\" Duarte turned to\r\nhis typewriter, glanced at what he had written on the sheet in the\r\nmachine. \"Mateo,\" he said, \"I'm meeting Dr. Gonzales in an hour. We're\r\ngoing to try to reach Lavandero with your Havana information on Ansaldo.\r\nWill you join me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I have some unfinished business myself. I think that before the\r\nnight is over we'll know a lot more about Ansaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\nHall stifled a yawn. \"I'm going to take a chance and shoot the works on\r\nsomeone who can talk. It might work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, Mateo. You look very tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll turn in early. Let's have breakfast at your place tomorrow, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHall found a phone booth in a tobacco shop near the Embassy. He called\r\nJerry.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would be you,\" she said. \"I was waiting for you to call, you\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you're hungry,\" he said. \"I'm taking you to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm famished. Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can be at the Bolivar in about fifteen minutes. Meet me in the\r\nlobby?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. But hurry. And just in case you've forgotten what I look\r\nlike, I'll be wearing a red carnation.\"\r\n\r\nHe became part of the growing multi-directional parade in the streets.\r\nNightfall had brought colored torches to the hands of many of the\r\nHermanitos, and hundreds of new huge portraits of the four leaders of\r\nthe United Nations. There was a new pattern to the street festivities.\r\nNow whole groups of Hermanitos, each marching behind a picture of one of\r\nthe four statesmen, made their way through the crowds to the embassies\r\nof the United Nations and then to the Plaza de la Republica, where they\r\nparaded their signs and their sentiments in front of all the government\r\nbuildings and the Presidencia. After that, the marchers joined the\r\nmilling groups of celebrators who just seemed to move around in slow\r\ncircles, singing, cheering, loudly wishing a long life to Anibal Tabio\r\nand the United Nations.\r\n\r\nThe darkened Plaza was packed, torches in the hands of hundreds of the\r\ncrowd bringing more light to the ancient square than had been seen there\r\nsince the nation had been forced to begin conserving its fuel. Hall cut\r\nthrough the crowds toward the Bolivar, too excited to sense his fatigue.\r\nThis is a night I shall long remember, he thought, this is the night I\r\nwill tell my children about if I ever have any children. This is the\r\nnight that I saw the power of the common people, the night I saw\r\ndemocracy take to the streets of a nation's capital and tell the world\r\nthat fascism's day of cheap triumphs is done. This is the night of the\r\nmeek who shall yet inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nThrough the shoulders of the crowd, he could see Jerry's red hair. As he\r\ndrew closer, he saw that she had two little girls in her arms. The\r\nchildren were crying wildly, the tears choking in their throats and\r\ncoursing down their contorted faces.\r\n\r\n\"There, there,\" Jerry was saying to them, \"everything will be all right.\r\nYou're only lost. We'll find out where you belong.\" But the strange\r\nforeign words only added to the terror in the frightened hearts of the\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" Hall asked Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"They're lost. I was afraid they'd get trampled or something, Matt.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the kids in their own language, soothing, silly words. Then\r\nhe took them in his arms while Jerry dried their tears with a perfumed\r\nhandkerchief. Between sobs, the little girls told Hall that they had\r\nslipped out of the house to see the fiesta and had been having a swell\r\ntime until the crazy lady swooped them up, talking crazy words and\r\nkeeping them from going on their way.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where you live?\" he asked them. They pointed toward their\r\nown house. \"We will take you there. And don't call the senorita a crazy\r\nlady, little ones. She is your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they lost?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no. Just tourists. Let's get them home, first.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls lived nearly a mile from the Bolivar. They watched the\r\nparaders in silence while Hall carried them to their house, but when he\r\nreached their block the girls insisted that they could walk the rest of\r\nthe way. \"No,\" he laughed, \"I'm taking you right to your door. And I'm\r\nwaiting in the street until you come to your window and throw me a\r\nkiss.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls, who had less than a dozen years between them, giggled and hid\r\ntheir heads in his shoulders. \"We won't throw you a kiss,\" the older of\r\nthe sisters said, shyly. \"You aren't our _novio_.\"\r\n\r\n\"These little devils!\" he laughed to Jerry. The girls began to squirm in\r\nhis arms. \"No, little ones,\" he told them, \"I won't make any more crazy\r\ntalk like the senorita.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is our house.\"\r\n\r\nHe put them down on the first steps. \"Now hurry,\" he said. \"Upstairs\r\nwith you, and be quick!\"\r\n\r\nThey scrambled up the stairs. \"They're sweet,\" Jerry said. For a brief\r\nmoment, the faces of the two little girls appeared at the open window on\r\nthe first floor. Then the ample figure of a woman in a white cotton\r\ndress loomed behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Let's scram before they catch it,\" Hall said, but he was too late. The\r\nshrill cries of the girls, as their mother flailed their behinds with a\r\nrighteous hand, followed Hall and Jerry down the street.\r\n\r\n\"Me and my Good-Neighbor policy,\" Jerry said. \"It's all my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"They deserve it. What would you do to your kids if they joined a\r\nstampede?\"\r\n\r\nJerry had to laugh. \"The same thing, I guess. But what's all the\r\ncelebrating about? Is it the local Fourth of July?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But I have a funny feeling that in years to come it might be. Your\r\npatient started it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tabio?\"\r\n\r\n\"President Anibal Tabio. He decided not to die today. He got out of bed\r\nand addressed the opening session of the Congress and called for war on\r\nthe Axis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding me again, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell I am. I was there. I saw him myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's paralyzed, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"He spoke from a wheel chair.\" He told Jerry about the speech, and as\r\nthey walked through the dense crowds toward a restaurant, he translated\r\nsome of the signs carried by the people who swarmed on all sides of her.\r\n\r\n\"_Abajo el Eje_--that's down with the Axis. And that one says Long live\r\nthe United Nations. _Mueran los Falangistas_--death to the Falangists.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Spanish fascists. Hadn't you heard of them before?\"\r\n\r\nJerry shook her head. \"I still don't see how he got out of bed. He must\r\nhave done it on nerves alone. I was at the lab all day with Marina and\r\nTabio's X-rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"He delivered a great speech, Jerry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet he did. I guess nothing can stop this country from joining the\r\ndemocracies now, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"Nothing but Gamburdo--if Tabio dies.\"\r\n\r\nThey had to wait on a street corner while a line of students carrying\r\nred torches snake-danced across their path.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we eating?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I know a wonderful place facing the sea wall. It's very plain, but the\r\nfood is stupendous. We'll have to walk, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm game. It's fun walking in these crowds tonight. It's almost like\r\nNew Year's Eve in New York.\"\r\n\r\nThe restaurant was packed. The waiter had to put an extra table on the\r\nsidewalk for Hall and Jerry. \"It's better from here anyway,\" Hall told\r\nher. \"We can see the ocean and get away from the din inside.\"\r\n\r\nA hundred happy men and women jammed the interior of the restaurant,\r\nsinging to the music of the small orchestra, toasting the slogans which\r\nwere all over San Hermano this night. Hall invited the waiter to drink a\r\ntoast in sherry to Don Anibal, and then he ordered lobster salads and\r\nsteaks for Jerry and himself.\r\n\r\n\"I missed you,\" he told Jerry and, hearing his words, he was startled to\r\nrealize that he meant them.\r\n\r\n\"You're just lonely. But I like to hear you say it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I really missed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong, Matt? You look all in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"I've had a long day. What do you think of this\r\nlobster salad?\"\r\n\r\nSmall talk. Make small, polite talk about lobsters and cabbages, talk\r\nabout the weather and your neighbor's garden, talk about anything before\r\nyou start talking love talk and then you'll forget why you have to talk\r\nto her at all. \"You're beautiful tonight,\" he said, softly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ignoring you, Hall.\"\r\n\r\nGood. Banter. Nice cheap cafe-society banter. Have to play the game as\r\nshe is played; silly brittle talk about nothing. Break her down, keep\r\nher off guard, keep your own guard up. Talk about the lobster. Talk\r\nabout the steak. Make vacuous wise-cracks over the coffee. Now she's\r\npleased with the guava pastry. Be the man of the world. Talk about\r\nguava.\r\n\r\n\"You're talking down at me, Matt. I told you once before. I'm not really\r\nstupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"God, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I must have been groggy all through dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sounded it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm too full.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's sit on the sea wall. It's the pleasantest spot in town.\"\r\n\r\nHall bought a paper from a passing newsboy. They walked along the sea\r\nwall for a block, and then he spread the paper out on top of the wall\r\nand lifted Jerry to the broad ledge. They sat facing the sea, not saying\r\nmuch of anything.\r\n\r\n\"The beach looks so clean,\" she said. \"Do you think ...\"\r\n\r\nHe leaped to the sand. \"Take my hand,\" he said, \"and bring the paper\r\nwith you.\" He spread the papers on the sand, laid his jacket over the\r\npapers, and sprawled on the makeshift pallet. Jerry sat near him, took\r\nhis head in her lap.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Matt! You're so tired. Want to tell me about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\nShe stroked his face with soft, gentle hands. \"About what's bothering\r\nyou, darling. Something terrible is happening to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're such a bad liar, darling. I can see it in your face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's enough. That is, when you care for a guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sticking your chin out, baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not. You're really a very gentle person. But you want to be\r\nhard as nails, don't you, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I want to be, baby. I'd like to see the world a good\r\nplace for little guys who like republics. I'd like to kill the bastards\r\nwho are fouling up such a world. It sounds very big, I know. But I'm not\r\nbig. I'm a little guy and I like the world of little people. Or don't I\r\nmake sense?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand you, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Later I'll read you Tabio's speech. Or at least the high lights, in\r\nEnglish. You'll get a pretty good idea of the things I believe in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it like on the other side, Matt? In the war, I mean. Or don't\r\nyou want to talk about the war?\"\r\n\r\nIt's now or never, he thought. Tell her about the war, tell it to her\r\nstraight. If she's ever going to see it, she's got to see it now. \"I\r\ndon't like to talk about it,\" he said, \"but I will. I guess I owe it to\r\nyou to talk about it. I was there when it started, and I kept hollering\r\nthat it had started, but no one would believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Poland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no! In Madrid. The summer of '36. I reached Madrid in the fourth\r\nweek of July, and by September I'd seen enough of the Nazis and the\r\nItalians to know it was World War Two.\" The words came easily, the whole\r\nfabric. Tabio had told the story as a historian. This was the other way\r\nit could be told, the way of the eyewitness, of the partisan. He told\r\nher everything, about the fighting in Spain and about the slaughter of\r\nthe innocents; about the grotesque ballets of death and disintegration\r\non the green tables of Geneva; about the arrows of Falange, reaching out\r\nfrom the festers of Spain to the New World. Everything but the role of\r\nAnsaldo.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I think you can guess why I'm so bothered about this\r\nwar, why I sometimes act as if I have a very personal stake in it.\r\nPlease try to understand what I mean, Jerry.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a long moment. \"I think I do,\" she said. \"For the\r\npast few days I've been thinking about the war. Ever since--oh, you know\r\nsince when. I've been thinking that if I don't do anything else, maybe\r\nI'll join the Army as a nurse when we leave here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got it bad, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I've got, darling. All I know is that I don't have\r\nthe right to be a Me Firster any more. Do you think I'm right about\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Baby, listen to me. You don't have to go to Bataan to get into the war.\r\nIt's spread everywhere. The front stretches from Murmansk to Manila to\r\nSan Hermano. And it's the same front.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can I do here?\"\r\n\r\nHall drew a deep breath. \"Let's both have a cigarette,\" he said. \"This\r\nis going to take some telling.\" He sat up, faced the girl, took her\r\nhands and held them firmly. \"Now, what I'm going to say might sound\r\nharsh, Jerry. But you'll simply have to believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do you know about Dr. Ansaldo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that he's a nice guy. He's never made a pass at me, he behaves\r\nlike a gentleman, and he's one crack surgeon. Don't tell me he's no\r\ngood, Matt. I just won't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to believe me,\" Hall insisted. \"What do you know about\r\nAnsaldo's past? Do you know where he was during the Spanish War?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the faintest idea. Do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I do. I saw him.\" Hall described his first meeting with Ansaldo.\r\nAs he spoke, Jerry abruptly withdrew her hands. Trembling, she backed\r\naway from him, started to get up.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you hadn't made love to me,\" she said, simply. \"Now I feel\r\ncheap--and used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that. I ...\"\r\n\r\n\"You know it's true. You're not just another newspaperman. And you don't\r\ngive a damn about me. It was Ansaldo you were interested in from the\r\nbeginning. That's why you were on the same plane with us on the way\r\nhere. And that's why you ...\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean I'm a G-man? Don't be absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't make it worse by calling me a fool. I liked you. I liked you a\r\nlot. Don't make it worse now, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're dead wrong.\" He tried to put his arms around her. She shook\r\nhim off. \"Believe me,\" he said, \"I'm not government. You were right--but\r\nonly partially--about my original interest in your party. But tonight I\r\nwish to hell it were only Ansaldo who interests me. It would make things\r\na lot easier all around. The other morning I was watching Marina when a\r\nSpanish ship came in. Someone didn't want me to watch. I was drugged.\r\nThat's why I disappeared for a few days. It damn near finished me. I've\r\ngot something on Ansaldo--before I'm through I hope to have enough to\r\nhang him. I mean it literally. I'm trying to have him fitted for the\r\nsame grave he thought I'd have. And it's going to be simple. What won't\r\nbe simple is convincing the authorities here that you were an innocent\r\nbystander in the whole affair. Do you think I would talk to you this way\r\nif things were as you suspect they are with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to think, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't stop liking me,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Take me back to the hotel, please. I'm all confused. I want to believe\r\nyou. Honestly I do. But what am I supposed to do? You give me the choice\r\nof matching one line against the other, and all the time I'll be\r\nwondering if both lines aren't fakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, baby ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't 'baby' me. You've got sand on your jacket. No, don't, Hall. Just\r\ntake me back to the hotel, please.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked to the sea wall in silence. Hall made a step for Jerry with\r\nhis hands, boosted her to the top of the wall. \"I'll try to find you a\r\ncab,\" he said. \"But before we turn in, I'm telling you again that I'm\r\nnot government. I'm exactly what I said I am. Believe me, Jerry. Please\r\nbelieve me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to believe any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do believe what I said about Ansaldo, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, miserably. \"Haven't you asked enough questions\r\nfor one night? Show me your badge and subpoena me or something to the\r\nAmerican Embassy and I'll tell you all I know. Which is nothing. I don't\r\nknow any more than I've already told you.\"\r\n\r\nHall was flagging every passing car. \"They're all private,\" he muttered.\r\n\"We'll never get a cab tonight. And for God's sake, stop sniffling. Even\r\nif I am a G-man I won't bite you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have played me for a sucker, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't play you for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say any more, Hall. Please don't.\"\r\n\r\nHer attitude infuriated him. Furiously, he flagged a passing car, biting\r\nhis lips in anger and frustration. He fought against yielding to his\r\nanger. \"Jerry,\" he said, \"there's one thing I'll have to ask you to do.\r\nI'm asking as a private citizen. But whatever you think I am, you'll\r\nhave to do this one thing. I must insist that you don't tell Ansaldo\r\nanything about our conversation or about my having been in Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that an order?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he roared. \"Yes, damn you, it's an order!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the cars he had flagged slowed down, pulled over to where he\r\nstood with Jerry. But it was not a taxi. It was a small chauffeur-driven\r\ntown car. The young Marques de Runa sat alone in the back seat.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" he smiled. \"Can I give you and your young lady a lift?\r\nYou'll never be able to get a public car tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\" Hall took Jerry's elbow, pulled her toward the door. He made\r\nthe introductions, then climbed in after Jerry and shut the door. \"We\r\nwere just going to the Bolivar,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Were you trying to escape from the mobs?\" the Marques asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. The lady has a bad cold. We thought the sea air might do it some\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should try the mountain air,\" the Marques said. \"I always take to\r\nthe mountain air when I have a cold, Senor Hall. Don't you think the\r\nmountain air is better?\"\r\n\r\nHall let the question go unanswered. He was looking into the mirror over\r\nthe driver's seat, studying what he could see in the small glass of the\r\nchauffeur's face.\r\n\r\n\"The mountain air, Senor Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Very dry. Perhaps the lady will try the mountain air. What do\r\nyou think, Jerry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" she said, sharply. \"I have hallucinations on mountain\r\ntops.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marques thought this was very funny. But not too unusual, he\r\nhastened to add. \"For example,\" he said, \"once when I was on a skiing\r\nweek-end in Austria, three members of our party saw an apparition.\" He\r\nchattered amiably about the experiences on that and other skiing trips,\r\ndirecting his words solely to Jerry. Hall ignored them both. He was\r\nstill staring at the mirror, and, after catching the chauffeur's eyes\r\nfor the second time, he knew definitely that the man at the wheel was\r\nthe little dog who had trailed him to the Ritz and then driven off after\r\nAnsaldo's limousine with Androtten as his passenger.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the car was less than a block from the Bolivar that\r\nHall spoke again. \"It's too bad,\" he said, his eyes trying to focus both\r\non the mirror and on de Runa, \"it's too bad about the Phoenix Garage\r\nblowing up today.\"\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur and the Marques started.\r\n\r\n\"But--why?\" the Marques asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. It's just that an officer in the British Embassy was\r\ntelling me just the other day that the Phoenix Garage was one of the\r\nmost fascinating establishments in San Hermano. I was planning to visit\r\nthe garage myself tomorrow. I'm interested in garages, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur stopped the car in front of the Bolivar with an abrupt\r\nslamming of his brakes.\r\n\r\nHall laughed. \"Your chauffeur was daydreaming, I think.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marques laughed, or tried to laugh, as if Hall had just made one of\r\nthe funniest remarks ever heard in San Hermano. \"That's what he is,\" the\r\nMarques laughed, \"a man who dreams by day. Very good, Senor Hall.\r\nExcellent.\"\r\n\r\nHall got out of the car, helped Jerry to the street. \"Thank you again\r\nfor picking us up,\" he said. \"And do something about your driver before\r\nhe starts driving into people in his sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe car was in gear and on its way down the street before the Marques\r\ncould make his answer heard.\r\n\r\n\"What was so funny about your crack?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you tomorrow. Are we still friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, Matt. Just leave me alone tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he smiled. \"Sleep on it. But please to keep the mouth shut,\r\nyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to my room, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I phone you in the morning?\"\r\n\r\nJerry ran into the hotel without answering. Hall stood in the street for\r\na moment, watching the receding crowds in the Plaza. They started to\r\nbecome a blur in his heavy eyes. He entered the lobby. Souza was going\r\nover a bill with two guests. Hall nodded to the night clerk, then went\r\ninto the small bar of the Bolivar to have a drink while Souza got rid of\r\nthe strangers.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the four tables in the bar room was occupied. Androtten and\r\na San Hermano coffee dealer sat at this table, three open copper\r\ncanisters between them. The Hollander was driving a hard bargain for two\r\ntypes of Monte Azul bean.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall,\" he smiled, \"delighted to see you healthy again. Delighted as\r\nhell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Healthy again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn rumors have been spread about the hotel that you were ill, Mr.\r\nHall. Not seriously as hell, I hope? Why don't you join us? Mr.\r\nRendueles has been trying to make a deal with me on some fairly choice\r\nbean.\"\r\n\r\nHall downed his double Scotch. \"No, thanks. I'd better get some sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You look sleepy, Mr. Hall. I wonder if we'll ever find time\r\nfor--you know--my damn story. Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of these days,\" Hall said. \"We'll get the complete story,\r\nAndrotten. All the facts, in complete detail. Good night.\" He paid for\r\nhis drink and went to the desk in the lobby.\r\n\r\n\"Your key,\" Souza said. \"I have it right here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. What's new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing, senor. Nothing at all.\" Souza was being profoundly\r\nimpersonal. \"I hope you are feeling better, senor. Oh, yes, message in\r\nyour box.\"\r\n\r\nThe message was from Souza himself, and the ink was not yet dry. \"I\r\ncan't speak now,\" it read.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Good night.\" Hall put the message in his pocket and went to\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself across the bed, yielding to the fatigue that was\r\ntearing at every nerve and muscle in his body. In the dark, he managed\r\nto get rid of his shoes and his suit, letting them drop to the floor\r\nwhen he had taken them off. He tried to think of all that had happened\r\nthat day, of what he would have to do tomorrow. The fading shouts of the\r\ncrowds in the Plaza grew fainter. The bed grew softer. He fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe phone bell woke him in a few minutes. Souza was calling. \"Senor\r\nHall, the drinks you ordered are on the way upstairs,\" he said. \"I am\r\nsorry for the delay, but we have a new waiter, and he is not accustomed\r\nto our system yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I get it.\" The _cabron_ of a night waiter was gone. The invisible,\r\ndetested _cabron_ whom Hall had never seen. He half expected Miguelito\r\nor Juan Antonio to be standing in the hall when he heard the knock on\r\nthe door. Instead, there was a short, swarthy man in his forties,\r\nbalancing a tray of brandy and soda in his right hand, a professional\r\nwaiter down to his flat feet and his bland smile.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bring it in, senor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please. Set it down here, on the little table.\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter closed the door, put the tray down. \"_Companero_ Hall,\" he\r\nsaid, the bland smile gone, \"permit me to introduce myself. I am Emilio\r\nVicente, delegate of the Waiters' Union.\" He shook Hall's hand, then\r\ngave him a calling card. It was Major Segador's private card.\r\n\r\n\"Turn it over, _Companero_ Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThe short message on the reverse side indicated that Hall was to trust\r\nVicente.\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to know you,\" Hall said. \"Will you have a drink with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some other time, _companero_. Tonight I have a message. Major Segador\r\nsuggests that should you need any assistance in a hurry, you can call\r\nupon me. I am at your orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nEmilio Vicente picked up his tray. \"_Companero_,\" he said, \"it might\r\nseem a little dangerous, but the Major assured us that you do not lack\r\nfor _cojones_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, _Companero_ Hall. You look as if you could use some sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter twelve_\r\n\r\n\r\nHall slept through the morning. He rose at noon, staggered into a cold\r\ntub, and then ordered a breakfast of steak and eggs. Vicente wheeled the\r\ntable into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking of the major's offer,\" Hall said. \"There's\r\nsomething you can do for me. Do you know anything about the Marques de\r\nRuna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He's a Falangist. His family owns one of the biggest import and\r\nexport companies in the country. The young one works there, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is he up to now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we can find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Do you know anything about his chauffeur?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But we can find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind if I ask Pepe Delgado to check up too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, _companero_. He is very reliable.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSan Hermano had settled back to her old routines when Hall left his\r\nroom. The trolleys ran, cars moved along all the streets, the loud\r\nspeakers on the poles and buildings had been taken down, and street\r\nsweepers were groaning over the litter of signs and papers they\r\nthemselves had helped scatter over the whole city the day before.\r\nYesterday's crowds had gone back to their jobs, their homes, their own\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe papers had little news about Tabio's condition. They carried his\r\nspeech and, in most cases, described the events which had followed\r\nTabio's speech as a spontaneous demonstration on the part of the people.\r\n_El Imparcial_ merely said that a great crowd had heard the speech over\r\nthe public amplifiers and that Red hoodlums had severely beaten some\r\nanti-communists who had joined the crowd in the Plaza to listen to the\r\naddress of the President.\r\n\r\nHall scanned the papers at a cafe table in Old San Hermano while Pepe\r\nwent to telephone some friends who were doing some further checking on\r\nthe Marques de Runa. The information Pepe received over the telephone\r\nwas very brief. At six o'clock that morning, the Marques de Runa and his\r\nchauffeur had taken a plane for Natal from the San Hermano airport.\r\n\r\n\"Wait for me in the car.\" Hall went to a phone himself, called Margaret\r\nSkidmore.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Pirate,\" she said. \"Getting lonesome for the farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. How about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't get away this week,\" she said. \"How about the week-end?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to let you know tomorrow. Tell me, Margaret, how well do you\r\nknow the Marques de Runa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing much. I left my notebook in his car last night, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. He told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the notebook?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. About your red-headed girl friend. She sounds like a good\r\nsubstitute for farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it out,\" Hall laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Is she the gal you were dreaming about at the wrong time one day last\r\nweek?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But about my notebook. It's not too important, but I had some\r\ninteresting things in it, Margaret. I was wondering how to reach the\r\nMarques.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be impossible today,\" she said. \"He just left for Barcelona on\r\na business trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he a good friend of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie? He's my fiance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding!\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'm to be the Marquesa de Runa. Didn't you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anyone else know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"He does. Now don't start cross-examining me about\r\nthat! It's my affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't. You always know what you're doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. I feel like doing some plowing over the week-end. With you.\r\nLet's talk about it then, if it still interests you. And in the\r\nmeanwhile, I'll have someone look through the car for your notebook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks a lot.\"\r\n\r\nHall went to the car. \"Let's go back to the hotel,\" he said, \"and find\r\nSouza. Or is the day clerk reliable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Pepe said. \"Arturo can be trusted. That's why Souza got\r\nhim the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot to do, Pepe. I want to search the room of the Dutchman,\r\nAndrotten. We'll need all the help we can get.\"\r\n\r\nThey found the task very simple. Androtten had left that morning with a\r\nsmall handbag on what he described to the clerk as a two-day buying trip\r\nin the south. With the day clerk standing guard at the phone and Vicente\r\nlounging in the hall to sound any needed alarm, Hall and Pepe entered\r\nthe Dutchman's room with a pass key and drew the blinds.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture of Androtten and what was evidently his family in a\r\nportable leather frame on the bureau. It showed Androtten and a fat\r\nblond matron sitting at a table, with a youth in his teens at\r\nAndrotten's left and a little girl leaning at the woman's knee. \"He's a\r\nfamily man,\" Pepe said.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see.\" Hall went through the wastebasket, the clothes hanging in\r\nthe closet, every drawer in the bureau. He examined every piece of\r\nluggage for false sides and bottoms, hidden compartments, and stray\r\npapers. In the traveling bag he found in the closet, Hall discovered a\r\nheavy brown envelope. Inside was the picture of a young colonial\r\nNetherlands officer and a letter from the Dutch Government-in-Exile. The\r\nletter regretted to inform Androtten that his esteemed son, Lieutenant\r\nWilhelm Androtten II, had perished fighting the Nazi invaders in the\r\nbattle for the Lowlands, and had been posthumously awarded the second\r\nhighest decoration the Queen gave such heroes. Hall had to guess at the\r\ncontents of the letter, using his German as a basis for deciphering the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\n\"Does this look like that boy grown up?\" he asked Pepe.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, Mateo. What does the letter say?\"\r\n\r\nHall gave him the gist of the letter as he understood it. \"But I still\r\nthink he's a fraud, Pepe. Let's examine the labels on his clothes\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe labels revealed only what Androtten had already indicated. London,\r\nAmsterdam, New Orleans, Rio. He had purchased no clothes in San Hermano.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to write a letter in my room. But wait for me. I think we're\r\ngoing to visit Duarte when I've got the letter finished.\"\r\n\r\nHis own room, he soon discovered, had also been searched that day. The\r\nlock on his traveling bag had been picked, and the stethoscope was\r\nmissing. He flung the new straw hat in the closet and went to the lobby.\r\nPepe was talking to the day clerk. He grinned at Hall, asked, \"So soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I changed my mind.\" Then, to the clerk, \"Where is Miss Olmstead? At the\r\nUniversity laboratory?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, senor. She went to the country with the two doctors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only that she went to the country. They will not be back tonight.\r\nThey left an hour ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Pepe. We have to get started.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down in the car. \"First stop the Mexican Embassy,\" Hall said.\r\n\"But wait there for me. I won't be too long.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"My room was searched. The stethoscope is missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means trouble, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. It also means that someone was careless. Where the hell were\r\nArturo and Vicente?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a big hotel, Mateo. We were talking about it only this morning.\r\nDuarte wants you to stay with him in his house for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Duarte is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have a good gun, Pepe. And good friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, Mateo. But stay with Duarte tonight. I think that tonight\r\nsomeone else should sleep in your bed. Duarte suggested three pillows or\r\na log. Then, in the morning, if there are no bullet holes in the\r\npillows ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the log ...\"\r\n\r\n\"... or the log, then you can say it was a mistake to sleep at Duarte's\r\nhouse tonight. Someone followed me this morning, Mateo. I drove him\r\ncrazy, but I couldn't get a look at him myself. It was very funny. But\r\nit is also serious.\"\r\n\r\nHall put the gun back in his pocket. \"Maybe it is,\" he said. \"I'll stay\r\nwith Duarte.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the right thing to do, Mateo. I'll leave you with Duarte. I have\r\nto see Souza and some other friends tonight.\"\r\n\r\nPepe waited at the curb until Hall was admitted to the Mexican Embassy.\r\nThen, his eyes sweeping the streets for signs of anyone shadowing him on\r\nfoot or by automobile, he took the most roundabout route he could devise\r\nto reach the Transport Workers' Union headquarters.\r\n\r\nDuarte had had no word from General Mogrado. \"I'm sure he met the\r\ncourier,\" he told Hall. \"But I'm worried by his silence. It is not like\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give him another night, Felipe. In the meanwhile, I'll send another\r\nletter to Havana. I just can't believe that the evidence on Ansaldo is\r\nnot available on this side of the ocean. If it's nowhere else, it must\r\nbe in Havana.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I know Havana. I know what the Spanish Republicans and the\r\nsecret police must have there. I tell you, Felipe, we can hang Ansaldo\r\nin Havana. Do you remember where and how I first saw Ansaldo in Burgos?\r\nWell, there was a photographer standing and working in front of me for\r\nhours that day. I know who he was, Felipe. He was the man from _Arriba_.\r\nI don't doubt but that either the Spaniards or the Cubans have a\r\ncomplete file of _Arriba_ in Havana. And I'm willing to bet my bottom\r\ndollar that I'll find those pictures of Ansaldo in that file.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Mateo. But I hope you don't have to go. Are you very tired?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could stand an hour's sleep before dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go to the house. Dr. Gonzales might join us for dinner. And\r\nLavandero is going to try to join us after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to Duarte's house in one of the Embassy's cars. Hall stretched\r\nout on the couch under the mural of Madrid and fell asleep in a few\r\nminutes. It was some while before he was rested enough to dream, and\r\nthen the figures in the mural above the couch began to move through his\r\nsleep in a macabre procession.\r\n\r\nDuarte woke him in an hour. \"Twice you yelled in your sleep,\" he said.\r\n\"And then you started to twist like a chained snake. Bad dreams, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" Hall said, his fingers working the muscles at the back of\r\nhis neck. \"I always dream about the bombardments when I feel bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gonzales and Lavandero can't meet us tonight. They're both at the\r\nPresidencia. I think Tabio is getting weaker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what they told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They just said they couldn't meet us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad. What have you got cooking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, _amigo_. I hired a new cook and she won't allow me to put\r\nmy face in the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be a smart cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll find out in a few minutes. I forgot to tell you, but Gonzales had\r\nsome news for us tonight. He says that Gamburdo is planning to delay the\r\nactual start of Congress for another week. His game is to allow the\r\npresent high feelings of the people to cool down a bit before the\r\nCongress starts its business.\"\r\n\r\nHall was puzzled. \"I don't quite understand the maneuver,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The Congress has to choose a delegation for the Inter-American parley,\r\nand to compose its mandate. Gamburdo still wants a delegation committed\r\nto neutrality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he get away with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? He was a long way toward success when Don Anibal stopped\r\nhim. The real question is how long can Don Anibal be counted on to get\r\nout of bed and fight for an anti-fascist war policy?\"\r\n\r\nA soft rain had started to fall while Hall was sleeping. It splashed\r\ngently against the open shutters of the cottage, embracing the house,\r\nthe palms and the papaya trees on the grounds, its soft rhythms throwing\r\nHall into a small boy's melancholy. He talked little during dinner, and\r\nwhen he did, it was to subject Duarte to his reminiscences of rainy days\r\nwhen he was very young.\r\n\r\nThey swapped yarns for hours, listened to Duarte's endless collection of\r\nMexican and flamenco records, and killed a bottle of black rum.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to sleep until noon,\" Hall said when they quit for the night.\r\n\r\nBut his sleep was cut short very early in the morning by Pepe, who\r\narrived with the news that Jerry had returned from the country late at\r\nnight and was trying desperately to contact Hall.\r\n\r\nHe phoned her at once.\r\n\r\n\"Matt,\" she said, \"can you come over right away? I think that I owe you\r\nan apology.\"\r\n\r\nJerry was waiting for him in her room. She had not had any sleep for a\r\nfull night, and her eyes showed it. Hall noticed that the two ash trays\r\nin the room were filled to the rims with fresh cigarette stumps.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm out of cigarettes. Have you got any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Cubans. They're very strong.\"\r\n\r\nShe accepted one, choked a bit on the first puff, then continued\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\n\"Give,\" he said. \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were right, I think. I can't swear to it, but I'm sure I recognized\r\nhis voice. The little Dutchman, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Androtten?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"He was at the ranch. I'm certain of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, baby. Sit down. Relax. Now start from the beginning.\r\nWhat ranch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you knew. I went to Gamburdo's brother's ranch with\r\nAnsaldo and Marina. Doctor was ripping mad. There was entirely too much\r\ninterference in the Tabio case, he said, and he'd called for a showdown.\r\nHe said he was going to stay on the ranch for a few days, or at least\r\nuntil the politicians who were interfering with him would come to their\r\nsenses. He said we'd all just take a holiday until we could go back to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who else was at the ranch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamburdo's brother, two men I've never seen before, and our hostess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you introduced to the two men?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's just it. They were not there when we arrived. They came on\r\nhorseback after we'd been there for some hours. Senora Gamburdo said\r\nthey were merely neighbors who wanted to talk over a cattle deal with\r\nher husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what makes you think she was lying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say, exactly, Matt. I didn't like the way she explained them to\r\nme--it was as if she felt that I insisted upon an explanation. That was\r\nwhen I decided to tell Ansaldo that I wanted to come back to town this\r\nmorning. I told him there was some shopping I'd neglected. He didn't\r\nseem to object at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did Androtten arrive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I told you--I didn't see him. I just heard his voice. It\r\nwas about five in the afternoon, I'd say. I was taking a dip in the\r\npool--alone. There was a puppy playing around the pool. He found one of\r\nmy red beach shoes and started to chew on it. Then he took the shoe in\r\nhis mouth and carried it over to the side of the house and left it near\r\na hedge.\r\n\r\n\"It was when I went for the shoe that I heard Androtten. Some sort of a\r\nconference was going on in the room above the spot where the pooch had\r\ndropped my shoe. I recognized the voices of Ansaldo and Marina and the\r\ntwo others. But most of the talking was being done by a new voice. I\r\nthought I recognized it. Then he stopped speaking Spanish and switched\r\nto German. I'm sure it was German.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was he saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't make it out. But he was very angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it was Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Definitely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you see into the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I didn't try, anyway. I was afraid. I just picked up my shoe and\r\nbeat it.\"\r\n\r\nHall hesitated. He gave Jerry a fresh cigarette, lit it for her. \"Could\r\nthey have seen you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"But that's not the end of it,\" she said. \"After\r\ndinner, Ansaldo took me for a walk in the garden. He made a lot of small\r\ntalk about different cases. Then he asked me why I insisted upon\r\nreturning to town. I told him again that I wanted to buy some things to\r\ntake home for friends. He was very pleasant about it. He asked me,\r\nhalf-seriously, if the real reason I wanted to go back was because I had\r\na date with you. He was acting the part of a jealous lover when he said\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Acting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he was only acting. Because when he said that I just laughed\r\nand said, 'Good heavens, no, doctor! The last time I saw Hall he said he\r\nwas going to make a small fortune writing the story of that little\r\nDutchman's experience with the Japs, and my guess is that he'll be\r\nspending the next few days locked up in his room with the Dutchman.'\r\n\r\n\"Ansaldo stopped dead in his tracks when I said that, Matt. He asked me\r\nwhich Dutchman I mean--but only after he had caught his breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say when you told him you meant Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much. He made a joke--a bad one--about Flying Dutchmen. And\r\nthen he continued talking about medical cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was the last you saw of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about. My train left at five-thirty this morning. He was asleep\r\nwhen I left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who drove you to the station?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marina and a ranch hand. Marina was glad to see me go. He hates to see\r\nme around Ansaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Is Ansaldo also a fairy?\"\r\n\r\n\"God, no!\" Jerry laughed. \"He's anything but.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're exhausted. Let me get you some breakfast,\" he said. \"And then,\r\nwhen you catch your second wind, maybe you'll remember some other\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I've told you everything, Matt.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up the phone, asked for Vicente. \"Ham and eggs?\" he asked\r\nJerry.\r\n\r\n\"No. Just coffee and toast.\"\r\n\r\nHall gave Vicente the order. \"And one other thing,\" he told the waiter.\r\n\"The woman is in trouble. Some one will have to keep an eye on her\r\ntoday. And let me know when the fat little foreigner on this floor\r\nreturns to town. He is a dangerous enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All those words for coffee and toast?\" Jerry asked. \"I've learned a few\r\nwords, Matt. I know that _mujer_ is woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you. I was asking him about his wife. She's been ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" Jerry relaxed in her chair. \"Tell me, Matt. What was it all about\r\nat the ranch? There was something wrong there. I know. Why should\r\nAnsaldo have wanted me around? And who is Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a big order, baby. There's only one thing I definitely know\r\nabout it. I know that Ansaldo is a hot shot in the Falange. I know that\r\ntwo Falange agents arrived in San Hermano on board a Spanish ship the\r\nother day, and that they were traced to the ranch. But I can only guess\r\nthat the two neighboring _estancieros_ you saw were these two visiting\r\nFalange agents.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Again I'm guessing. I know that a Nazi general named Wilhelm von Faupel\r\nis the man who actually runs the Falange. I know something about the way\r\nthe Nazis work. O.K. So I assume that Androtten--if it really was\r\nAndrotten whose voice you heard--is a Gestapo agent. That would make\r\nsense. Hitler orders Tabio's death; the job is handed to Hitler's\r\nFalange, and a Gestapo officer tags along to run the show in San Hermano\r\nas his comrades run it in Spain. It would all make sense if we could\r\nprove that the two visiting _estancieros_ were the Falange agents off\r\nthe _Marques de Avillar_, and that Androtten was the man you heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why should they have wanted me around?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle rap on the door. \"Time out for coffee,\" Hall smiled.\r\n\"_Entrada!_\"\r\n\r\nThe door was unlocked. The handle turned, and Wilhelm Androtten entered.\r\nHe took off his small Panama hat, fanned his red, puffy face with it.\r\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, \"they told me at the desk that I would find you here,\r\nMr. Hall. Hot as hell, isn't it?\" He put a large coffee canister on the\r\narm of a chair. \"May I sit down?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\" Hall glanced at Jerry, whose fingers were clenched tightly\r\non a large amber comb. \"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nAndrotten put the canister on his lap. \"Oh, my dear Mr. Hall,\" he\r\nsighed, his pudgy right hand resting on the lid of his tin. \"I just\r\nwanted to tell you that I am leaving for Rio on an extended buying trip\r\ntomorrow. If you still are interested in my damn story, perhaps you\r\ncould spare me some time this afternoon, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it could be managed,\" Hall smiled. \"Did you buy all the damn\r\nMonte Azul bean you wanted, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Oh, yes indeed, Mr. Hall. Fine, rich, full-bodied bean,\r\nfragrant as hell. Please, I'll show you.\" Androtten opened the canister.\r\nThere was no coffee under the lid. Instead, there was a small automatic\r\npistol, equipped with a gleaming silencer.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" Androtten sighed, \"no noise, please. I should hate to be\r\nforced to shoot you both.\"\r\n\r\nJerry stifled a muted cry. \"You wouldn't dare,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool, Hall. I hope you have already noticed that my gun is\r\nequipped with the only silencer in this jungle of Indians and\r\nblackamoors.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Gestapo--you Nazis think of everything, don't you?\" Hall said in a\r\nrising voice.\r\n\r\n\"I must remind you again not to shout, Hall. Please, lock your hands on\r\ntop of your head.\"\r\n\r\nHall obeyed the order.\r\n\r\n\"If the nurse co-operates, she will be spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Jerry, do anything the Nazi orders,\" Hall cried. \"He\r\nhas a gun!\"\r\n\r\nThe little man with the gun angrily raised a finger to his lips. \"Not\r\none word out of you,\" he whispered. He got out of the chair, started\r\nbacking toward the door. \"Now,\" he said, \"listen carefully, both of you.\r\nFor your information, Hall, I am not Gestapo. I am from the\r\nIbero-American Institute in Berlin. And that, I am afraid, is the last\r\ninformation you will ever receive about anything, Hall.\"\r\n\r\nThe comb in Jerry's hand snapped with a dry little crack. The sudden\r\nnoise startled Androtten. He raised the gun and fired just as Hall dove\r\nfor his feet. Three times the cough of a silenced gun sounded in the\r\nroom. The shots seemed to come all together. A split second after the\r\nthird shot was fired Hall had kicked the gun from the limp hand of the\r\nNazi and was sitting astride his chest with his hands locked on\r\nAndrotten's throat. He was oblivious to the noise at the balcony, to\r\nJerry, to everything but the man dying under him.\r\n\r\nA gentle hand tugged at Hall's shoulder. \"Enough, Mateo. The _cabron_ is\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nEmilio Vicente had climbed into the room from the balcony. He had a\r\npistol in his hand. \"The woman,\" he said. \"She has fainted.\"\r\n\r\nJerry was lying in a heap on the floor near her chair. \"Christ, she was\r\nhit!\" Hall rushed to her side, examined her for bullet wounds.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mateo. His bullet sailed over my head. My bullets both hit him. I\r\naimed for the heart. See, you are covered with his blood, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"Water.\" Hall was sitting on the floor, Jerry's head in his lap, a hand\r\nclasped firmly over her mouth. He dipped a handkerchief into the glass\r\nVicente gave him, ran it over her face. \"Jerry,\" he whispered, \"promise\r\nme you won't yell if I take my hand away? Everything is all right. His\r\nshot missed us both, and now he's under control.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"I'm sorry I passed out,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You're O.K. now.\"\r\n\r\nVicente, standing over them, grinned at the girl. \"_Si_, you\r\n_magnifica_,\" he said. \"You make boom noise of comb. She\"--he pointed to\r\nAndrotten, who lay under a blanket Vicente had found while Hall was\r\nreviving Jerry--\"she have much scare of boom, she shoot much badly. Me,\r\nEmilio, shoot much good. She no good no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead? _Muerto?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Much dead.\" Vicente showed them his pistol. He pointed to his own\r\nsilencer. \"I heard the son of a whore mother,\" he said to Hall, a\r\nsardonic smile on his grim face. \"When he gets to hell he will learn\r\nthat there were other silencers in this jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"But naturally, _companero_. I followed him to the door and listened.\r\nWhen you shouted to the woman that the Nazi had a gun, I knew you were\r\nshouting for me. I have a gun, too. And a pass key. So I rushed into the\r\nnext room and climbed over to the balcony. It was not difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were very good. You saved our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can get up, Matt,\" Jerry said. \"I'd rather sit in the chair.\"\r\n\r\nHall helped her to the chair, told her what Vicente had done. Vicente\r\nlaughed at Hall's account of his heroism. \"It was nothing,\" he repeated.\r\n\"The Nazi was too fat to miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's very messy,\" Hall said, looking at the blanket.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with the body?\" Hall asked Vicente.\r\n\r\n\"Feed it to the sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better fingerprint him and make photos of the face, first,\" Hall\r\nadvised. \"And let Segador know immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be tranquil, _companero_. All in good time. When you and the woman\r\nleave, Pepe and I shall put the remains of this dog in a laundry basket\r\nand get it out of here.\" Vicente looked at Jerry. \"And I think you had\r\nbetter get her out of this room. She is going to get sick if she stays\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\" Hall gave Jerry his hand. \"Come on, nurse,\" he smiled.\r\n\"We're going to my room. This is no place for a lady.\" He helped her to\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nShe held her hand out to Vicente. \"You are very sweet,\" she said.\r\n\"_Usted mucho dulce._ Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Understand,\" he laughed. He kissed her hand.\r\n\r\nHall had a bottle of brandy in his room. He poured two stiff drinks for\r\nJerry and himself. \"Feel any better?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It was awful for a few minutes. I was afraid he would kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was I, baby. I was afraid he'd kill me before I ever got around to\r\ntelling you how I felt. About you, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel about me?\"\r\n\r\nHe filled the glasses again. \"Still think I'm a cop?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care. I guess you aren't, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd have died if he killed you. I love you, Matt.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the edge of the bed. He stood over her, took the\r\nglass from her hand. \"You know how I feel, then,\" he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she said, raising her face, \"didn't you think that I knew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" he laughed. \"I'm filthy with his blood. I'd better change my\r\nclothes.\"\r\n\r\nHe found a fresh suit and a clean shirt in his closet. \"I'll change in\r\nthere,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she said, while he was changing, \"I still can't figure out\r\nwhy Ansaldo wanted me at the ranch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can, baby. It's not so hard. Figure it out for yourself. The\r\nbeautiful American nurse is a complete political innocent. Sees all,\r\nknows nothing. A perfect set-up. The Falangist doctors take you along to\r\nSan Hermano. You sit in the sickroom while Ansaldo examines Tabio. You\r\nyourself work on the smears and the slides in the laboratory. You are\r\nthe clean, unbiased witness who can testify that scientifically all was\r\non the up and up. Your existence is proof that Ansaldo's visit was\r\nlegitimate. If anything was shady, he'd bring a Falangist nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why was I brought to the ranch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Same reasoning. Lavandero blocks Ansaldo's plans. Meanwhile, the\r\nFalange sends two agents from Spain with the latest orders for Ansaldo.\r\nHe has to sneak out of town to confer with them. So does Androtten, the\r\nNazi boss of the expedition. Again Ansaldo takes the unbiased,\r\nnon-political nurse along. She is still the witness. She sees nothing\r\nwrong at the ranch, and, after Ansaldo puts Tabio in the grave, if\r\nanyone starts to suspect anything, they question the obviously innocent\r\nAmerican nurse and she backs Ansaldo's story. She really hasn't seen a\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" Jerry said, \"until the dumb American nurse stood under the\r\nwrong window and heard Joe Nazi himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think they know that I heard Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say. But just to play safe, you're moving out of this hotel to\r\nwhere they can't find you. And right away. Not that they're not\r\nprepared. Remember, you didn't _see_ Androtten. They know that much. By\r\nnow you can bet your bottom dollar that they have a coffee planter three\r\nhundred miles from the Gamburdo ranch who will swear on a stack of\r\nBibles that Androtten was with him for the past three days, and a whole\r\nslew of witnesses to back him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But won't it make them suspicious if I move?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell with them, baby. It's you that counts now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm staying. I won't spoil it for you by playing into their\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nHall took her in his arms. \"You're wonderful,\" he said. \"But ...\"\r\n\r\nThe phone began to ring. It was Dr. Gonzales. \"Can you come over to the\r\nPresidencia at once?\" he asked. \"Yes, very important. I am in Don\r\nAnibal's apartment. Please, hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be right over.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on. We're going to the Presidencia. It sounds like the end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter thirteen_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe private elevator in the Presidencia was both carpeted and\r\nbullet-proof, as it had been in General Segura's day. But the\r\nmagnificent bronze friezes of General Segura's capture of San Hermano\r\nhad long since been melted down to make medals, and in place of the\r\nmartial friezes there now hung a series of water colors painted by\r\ngrade-school children in the small villages. Every year, Hall explained\r\nto Jerry as the car climbed to the fourth floor, a committee of the\r\nRepublic's leading artists chose twenty water colors submitted by the\r\nschools for a place in this elevator. The students whose pictures were\r\nchosen received medals made from the bronze frieze which had originally\r\nhung in their places.\r\n\r\nGonzales was waiting for them at the fourth-floor landing. \"Are you all\r\nright?\" he asked Jerry, and without waiting for an answer he took Hall's\r\narm and started to walk down the long gilded corridor toward the private\r\nlibrary of the President.\r\n\r\nThe library was large, perhaps forty feet square, the four walls were\r\nlined with books from floor to ceiling. In one corner was an immense\r\nmahogany writing table, clean now except for a drinking glass packed\r\nwith sharpened pencils and a large yellow foolscap pad. When Tabio was\r\nwell, this table was always piled high with books, most of them opened\r\nand kept in place by an inkwell, a heavy watch, or another book. Today\r\nthere were no books on Don Anibal's table; instead, almost as if in\r\nexplanation, a padded steel and aluminum wheel chair stood empty near\r\nthe little corridor which led to the door of the President's bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sit down.\" Gonzales indicated two leather chairs.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in the way,\" Jerry said. \"I don't belong here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had to take her along,\" Hall said. \"It was a matter of her life. Is\r\nthere some place where she can rest while we--while we talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me. I will make the arrangement.\" Gonzales stepped out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"What's happening?\" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It looks bad. Whatever it is, don't cave in on me now. It\r\nwon't do anyone any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right now. But I'll probably have nightmares about today for\r\nthe rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\nGonzales returned to the library with a middle-aged maid in a simple\r\nuniform. \"Please, nurse,\" he said, \"this lady will escort you to a quiet\r\napartment. You will find brandy and a bed. I hope you will forgive us\r\nand find comfort.\" His blue lips tried to smile at Jerry as she followed\r\nthe maid out of the library.\r\n\r\n\"You're not well,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nThe blue lips tightened. \"I'm a cardiac, you know. But it is not of\r\nimportance. Simon Tabio will join us in a moment. It is very serious,\r\n_companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Anibal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Simon will tell you about the new development. He is young, but he\r\nis very strong. He knows that Gamburdo is a traitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he told Don Anibal?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mere telling might kill him. We must have the proof before we tell\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"The proof?\" Hall started to tell the ailing doctor about Androtten when\r\nSimon Tabio entered the library.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Simon. This is _Companero_ Mateo Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do?\" the boy said, in English. \"I regret that we must meet\r\nunder such sad circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"_El habla castellano, chico_,\" Gonzales said.\r\n\r\n\"The sorrow weighs with equal weight in my own heart,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"_Companero_ Hall was on the point of telling me some important news\r\nwhen you came in, Simon. I think you should hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to hear it,\" Simon said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know about Corbeta the Falange agent and Jimenez the C.T.E.\r\nradio operator being at the Gamburdo ranch with Ansaldo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Segador has kept me informed.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one other man at the ranch with them, a Nazi. An agent of the\r\nIbero-American Institute named Androtten. At least that was the name he\r\nused. He reached San Hermano on the same plane which brought Ansaldo and\r\nme.\" Hall told them of Jerry's accidental discovery and of the events\r\nwhich followed and brought about the death of the Nazi. He told it in\r\nvery few words, his eyes taking in the uncanny resemblance between Simon\r\nand his father.\r\n\r\n\"My father is very ill, senor. We must be able to prove your story for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is my friend,\" Hall said. \"He will believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very ill. I believe you, of course. But what proof have we for my\r\nfather that Androtten was a Nazi agent? If you know my father at all\r\nwell, senor, you must surely know his passion for the truth. And we must\r\nremember that in his illness ...\" The boy's voice trailed off to\r\nnothingness, and he turned away from his elders.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" Gonzales said, gently, \"I think that you had better tell\r\n_Companero_ Hall about what happened this morning.\"\r\n\r\nSimon Bolivar Tabio dabbed at his reddened eyes with a white\r\nhandkerchief. \"They are killing him,\" he said, brokenly. He paused to\r\nswallow the painful lump in his throat, ashamed before the friends of\r\nhis father for his weakness.\r\n\r\n\"There are many tears in San Hermano for Don Anibal,\" Hall said. \"You\r\nshould be proud of your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"This morning,\" Simon said, \"Dr. Marina arrived here with a written\r\nmessage for my mother from Dr. Ansaldo. The surgeon refused to operate\r\nwithout the written permission of the entire Cabinet. He says in the\r\nnote that he refuses to predict how long my father can live without an\r\noperation. He says that the operation must be performed immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is murder,\" Gonzales said. \"Every doctor in San Hermano who has\r\nexamined Don Anibal swears that he is too weak to undergo an operation\r\nright now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He sent a copy of the note to each member of the Cabinet,\" Simon said.\r\n\"They refuse to discuss the question without my father's permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dirty bastard,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"We were discussing you this morning,\" Gonzales said. \"Lavandero and\r\nSimon and myself. We think that if we get no further actual proof, we\r\nwill have to place a great burden on your shoulders, _Companero_ Hall.\r\nDon Anibal trusts you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to tell Don Anibal what I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not immediately. It would be too great a shock. Don Anibal would demand\r\nproof even from you. But if he hears from you that you are here to\r\ninvestigate the Falange and then if, say tomorrow, you come back\r\nand tell him that you have run across some important information,\r\nperhaps ...\"\r\n\r\n\"But have we time to break it to him in easy stages? Is\r\nhis--health--adequate?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a chance we are forced to take,\" Simon said. \"My father's health\r\nis not--adequate--for a sudden shock.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right. I have already notified Segador about Androtten.\r\nPerhaps by tomorrow he will have established Androtten's real identity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will see my father now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do anything you ask, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, then.\" Simon left the library.\r\n\r\n\"Don Anibal is not going to live,\" Gonzales said when the boy left. \"Not\r\neven a miracle can save his life.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was tearing the stopper from a small vial of adrenalin. He\r\nheld the open mouth of the vial to his nose and breathed deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Adrenalin?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, _companero_. Say nothing to Simon, please.\" A corner of\r\nhis blue underlip was growing purple in tiny spots. \"I hear him now,\r\nMateo.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy carried his shoulders proudly when he returned to the library.\r\n\"My father is sitting up in bed,\" he said. \"He is preparing a radio\r\nspeech to the entire Republic.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gonzales was incredulous. \"Are you sure, _chico_?\"\r\n\r\nSimon touched his right eye with his index finger. \"I have seen it at\r\nthis moment. My father is a great and a brave man. He says that we\r\nshould bring _Companero_ Hall in at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe door leading to Tabio's room was opened by an armed army sergeant.\r\n\"The President will see you now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHall followed Simon and Gonzales through the small corridor which took\r\nthem to the sick room. The shutters were opened, and the sun streamed\r\ninto the chamber, bathing everyone and everything in its gentle light.\r\nAnibal Tabio was sitting up in bed, his hand raised in a familiar\r\ngesture as he dictated to a secretary who sat on a stool near his\r\npillows.\r\n\r\n\"Neutrality,\" he was dictating, \"neutrality is either abject surrender\r\nto Hitler or an open admission of complicity with the fascist Axis or a\r\nsinful combination of both...\"\r\n\r\nThe swarthy Esteban Lavandero was, as always, at Tabio's side, his\r\nfierce Moorish face twisted with pain and love. He stood behind the girl\r\nsecretary, one black hairy hand resting on the carved headboard of the\r\nancient bed, his ears cocked for every word which came from Tabio's pale\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nTabio's wife and two doctors in white coats stood on the other side of\r\nthe bed. The prim white collar of her dark dress matched the streaks of\r\nwhite in her long black hair. Her luminous _mestiza's_ eyes, swollen\r\nfrom quiet weeping, were now bright and clear, and when Anibal Tabio\r\nlooked to his wife after turning a particularly telling phrase in his\r\nspeech her generous lips parted and she smiled at him the way she had\r\nsmiled to reward his earliest writings three decades ago.\r\n\r\n\"The great North American martyr to freedom, Don Abraham Lincoln, a man\r\nof great dignity whose humor was the humor of the people from whose\r\nloins he sprang, was a man who many years ago described such neutrality.\r\nLincoln was not a neutral in the struggle between slavery and freedom.\r\nAnd when some fool insisted that most Americans were neutral in this\r\nstruggle, Lincoln replied with the anecdote of the American woman who\r\nwent for a walk in the woods and found her husband fighting with a wild\r\nbear. Being a neutral, this woman stood by and shouted, 'Bravo, Husband.\r\nBravo, Bear.'\r\n\r\n\"And then, Lincoln said ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Anibal,\" one of the doctors said, gently, \"I must implore you ...\"\r\nThe restraining hand of Tabio's wife made him stop.\r\n\r\n\"It is no use, doctor,\" Tabio smiled. \"At a time like this, if a\r\nPresident can speak at all, he must speak to his people. Tonight you\r\nwill type my speech, and tomorrow you can bring the microphone right\r\ninto this room, and right from my bed I shall talk to the people. If I\r\nam to die in any event, it will not matter much. And if I am to live,\r\ndoctor, the speech will not kill me.\"\r\n\r\nSimon, who was standing next to Hall in the doorway, whispered that\r\nTabio's eyes were too weak to distinguish them at that distance. They\r\nstarted to walk toward the bed on their toes, and Hall, glancing at\r\nTabio sitting up in the old bed in a white hospital gown surrounded by\r\nthe burly Lavandero and his wife and son, was suddenly struck by the\r\nsimilarity of the scene which was before him and the Dore engraving of\r\nthe death of Don Quixote. It was all there, even to the faithful Sancho\r\nPanza figure of Lavandero, and at that moment Hall knew why Spanish\r\nsavants had for hundreds of years written scores of books on the true\r\nsignificance of Cervantes' classic. Here were the two great impulses of\r\nthe Hispanic world, the fragile, gentle, trusting dreamer of great new\r\nhorizons and at his side the broad-backed practical man of earth who\r\nthrew his strength into the effort of implementing the dreams and making\r\nthem the new realities. Here was the visionary Juarez and the young\r\nsoldier Porfirio Diaz, when the warrior was still a man untainted by his\r\nown betrayal of a people's dream. Here was the romantic poet Jose Marti\r\nand one of his durable guerrilla generals, Maximo Gomez or Antonio\r\nMaceo, whose white and black skins, blended, would have yielded a skin\r\nthe color of Lavandero's. (Was it any wonder, then, Hall thought in\r\nthose fleeting seconds before Tabio recognized him, that Tabio as a\r\nyoung exile went to Cuba to write a biography of Marti while his\r\nfaithful fellow-exile spent the same months in Havana writing an equally\r\ngood study of Maceo?)\r\n\r\nAt that moment Tabio saw Hall. \"_Viejo!_\" he said, happily. \"Mateo Hall,\r\na good friend and thank God never a neutral. Senorita, give him your\r\nstool. Come, sit down, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\nHall took his hand, tenderly, for fear of hurting him. It was a thin\r\nhand, bony and fleshless; cold, as though Death had already touched it.\r\n\r\n\"_Viejo_,\" Tabio said. He might have been genially scolding a favorite\r\nchild. \"Say something, old friend, and don't sit there staring at me as\r\nif I were already a corpse. Tell me about yourself, Mateo. We've come a\r\nlong way since Geneva and Madrid and the day they fished you out of the\r\nocean, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been a long time,\" Hall said. \"A very long time, Don Anibal. A\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nTabio smiled. \"Time is of no matter. It is the present and the future\r\nwhich counts, eh, _viejo_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, _ilustre_.\"\r\n\r\n\"My family and my good friends are afraid that I am dying,\" Tabio said,\r\nsmiling as if at some secret joke he wanted to share with Hall. \"I am an\r\nold dog. An old prison dog. Tell them, _viejo_, tell them that our breed\r\ndoesn't die so easily, no?\"\r\n\r\nHall could only nod and pat the sick man's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do I sound like a dying man?\"\r\n\r\nHall swallowed hard, managed to grin. \"You? What nonsense, Don Anibal! I\r\nwas at the Congress the other day. I watched you and listened to you\r\nspeak. It was a great speech, Anibal.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not a great speech. But it was good because I spoke the truth.\r\nAnd do you know, Mateo, that the truth is better than any great speech?\"\r\nTabio was breathing with increased difficulty. He slumped back against\r\nthe pillows, but out of the corner of his eye he saw the doctors\r\nquicken, and he turned to them and winked. \"Not yet,\" he smiled. Meekly,\r\nhe allowed one of the doctors to hold a tumbler of colored liquid under\r\nhis mouth. He sipped some of it through a bent glass tube, then turned\r\nto Hall again.\r\n\r\n\"Where were you sitting?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the diplomatic box with Duarte and the Mexican Ambassador. Don't try\r\nto talk to me, Anibal. Save your strength. I'll be here for a long time,\r\nand when you're out of bed and on your feet again, perhaps we can have a\r\nreal visit and sit up all night talking as we used to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mateo! You talk like a child. I will never be on my feet again. But\r\njust the same,\" and he winked impishly at his wife, \"I'm a long way from\r\ndying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are,\" Hall insisted.\r\n\r\n\"There, you see?\" Tabio said to everyone in the room. \"Mateo can tell\r\nyou. He knows how tough our breed is. Tell me, Mateo, is it true that\r\nthe American Ambassador considers me to be the most violent Bolshevik\r\noutside of Russia?\"\r\n\r\nLavandero laughed, and Hall laughed, and when Tabio, laughing, turned to\r\nhis wife and son, they laughed too.\r\n\r\n\"He is such a pompous fool, that Ambassador. Oh, I am being terribly\r\nundiplomatic, _viejo_, but to think of an old-fashioned bourgeois\r\nreformer like me being compared to Lenin and Stalin! It is the height of\r\nconfusion. But if you ever meet him you can tell him that I admire\r\nStalin and the Russian people. Your Ambassador and I were together at a\r\nState dinner the day the Nazis invaded Russia and he said that the\r\nSoviets would be crushed in a month and that he was glad. I told him\r\nthen that the Red Army would destroy the Nazi war machine and I told him\r\nthat before the war was over the United States would be fighting on the\r\nside of Russia and that therefore it was dangerous of him to say he was\r\nglad so many Red Army soldiers were being killed. And you can tell him\r\nthat some day when I speak to Mr. Roosevelt again I will tell him what\r\nthe American Ambassador to our country said openly in June of 1941.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Don Anibal,\" one of the doctors begged, \"you must save your\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the speech,\" Lavandero added, quickly, motioning to Hall that it\r\nwas time for everyone but the doctors to leave the room.\r\n\r\nHall stood up, again patted the blue-veined hand of the President. He\r\nwatched Tabio, pausing to gain strength, mutely protesting with glazed\r\neyes the obvious stage directions of the doctors who ended this visit.\r\n\r\n\"I must go now, Don Anibal,\" Hall said, softly. \"If you wish, I will be\r\nback tomorrow or the next day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Matthew,\" Tabio said, and he began to address Hall in English, \"you\r\nwere in Spain. You saw. Tell them it does not matter if one man lives or\r\ndies. I have no fears for truth. I have come a long way on truth. Tell\r\nthem, _viejo_, tell them what a miracle truth is in the hands of the\r\npeople. You have but\"--the words were coming with great difficulty--\"you\r\nhave but to make this truth known....\"\r\n\r\nTabio's jaw sagged open. He fell forward against his knees. The doctors\r\ntook him by the shoulders and moved him into a prone position. His eyes,\r\nstill open, stared at everything and nothing, glass now.\r\n\r\n\"_Carino mio!_\" his wife sobbed, but at an unspoken order from one of\r\nthe doctors Simon led his mother to a chair in the corner and kept her\r\nstill. Lavandero, Gonzales and Hall left the chamber for the library.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to Anibal?\" Lavandero asked Gonzales.\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. \"It is the end,\" he said. \"Don Anibal will\r\nnever speak again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Esteban.\" He turned to Hall. \"His last words were to you,\r\n_companero_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ Almighty!\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, tell me what happened to Anibal!\"\r\n\r\n\"He fell into a coma. I think it is a stroke.\" Gonzales sat heavily in\r\none of the leather chairs, began to fumble in his pocket for another\r\nadrenalin vial. His fingers began to become frantic in their impotence.\r\n\"I--I ...\"\r\n\r\nHall caught his head as he started to collapse. He reached into the\r\ndoctor's pocket, found the adrenalin and used it.\r\n\r\n\"It is a stupid way to live,\" Gonzales said. \"To have your life depend\r\nalways on your being a vegetable with a bottle. Thank you, _companero_.\r\nJust let me rest here for a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout all of this, Lavandero stood over Tabio's table, staring down\r\nat the jar of pencils with a dark, ugly face. He clenched opened\r\nclenched opened clenched his fists, his fingers working to no definite\r\nrhythm, and then he looked at his fists opening and closing and for a\r\nfew minutes it seemed as if he looked upon his own hands with loathing.\r\nThen, straightening up, he put his hands in the pockets of his blue\r\njacket and turned to Hall and Gonzales. \"This is no time to plan\r\npersonal violence,\" he said. \"It would be exactly what the fascists\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your orders,\" Hall said. \"I think you know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am counting on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep out of sight for a few hours. I think you should go to Gonzales'\r\nhouse. I'll get you an official car and a chauffeur.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not alone,\" Hall said. He told Lavandero about Jerry and the death\r\nof Androtten.\r\n\r\n\"_Madre de Dios_, take her with you! And keep her hidden.\" The sweat\r\npouring down his face betrayed Lavandero's excitement; his voice was\r\ncalm and steady. \"I'll send an armed guard with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get the nurse,\" Gonzales said.\r\n\r\n\"No. Don't get up. Tell us where she is.\"\r\n\r\nLavandero had taken over. Later, Hall knew, the man would allow himself\r\nto fly into a wild rage, but he would do it alone, where no one could\r\nhear or see him. And Hall knew, also, that soon Lavandero would be\r\nengaged in a battle with Gamburdo and the fascists for control of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter fourteen_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe black Packard roared out of the subterranean garage of the\r\nPresidencia, shot out to the Avenida de la Liberacion. Hall and Jerry,\r\nin the back seat, looked behind them at the second Packard which carried\r\ntheir convoy of guards. \"They have enough tommy guns back there to blow\r\nup anyone who makes a pass at us,\" he said. \"And the two boys in the\r\nfront seat can throw plenty of lead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like a gangster movie,\" Jerry said.\r\n\r\n\"That shooting in your room this morning was no movie. I've never seen a\r\ndeader Nazi than the late Wilhelm Androtten, alias X.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's going to happen to us now, Matt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am worried. I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nThe two cars pulled up at the doctor's house. Maria Luisa, Gonzales'\r\nfourteen-year-old daughter, met them at the door. \"I am preparing some\r\nsandwiches,\" she said. \"Father said you were famished.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited in the living room while the girl worked in the kitchen.\r\n\"You're too hot in San Hermano,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. They don't know what happened to Androtten. I can just go on\r\nbeing Ansaldo's nurse until ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" he snapped. \"This isn't for amateurs any longer. And you're\r\nstill an amateur, baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what do you suggest I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going back to the States with a bodyguard on the next plane out\r\nof here. You're waiting for me in Miami. I'll give you a letter to one\r\nof the chiefs of Military Intelligence there. You'll be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll meet you in two weeks. Three weeks at the outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't do it, Matt. I'm staying here with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I won't be here all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll wait here for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baby, listen.\" He took out a package of American cigarettes, put one in\r\nher mouth, lit it. \"Ladies don't smoke in San Hermano. You can smoke\r\nuntil you hear anyone coming. Then hand it to me. Now, sit down like a\r\ngood girl, and for God's sake, listen carefully. There's a job I've got\r\nto do. It's my job alone. I've got to do it alone. I had an idea that\r\nbefore I was through here I'd have to do it. But Tabio's last words were\r\nspoken in English and they were to me, and baby, as soon as he stopped\r\ntalking I knew what I had to do.\"\r\n\r\nHall quoted the President's words about the power of Truth. \"And he was\r\nright,\" he said. \"I remember what happened when I got out of the can in\r\nSpain. I went back to Paris to get some rest. Tabio was in Geneva,\r\npacking his things to go home. I found out he was still there and I went\r\nto see him before he left. He was going home to run for President so\r\nthat this country shouldn't become a second Spain.\r\n\r\n\"I remember telling him that the thing which kept me alive in Franco's\r\nprison was my feeling that a miracle would happen--that the little guys\r\nin England and France would force the appeasers to sell guns to the\r\nRepublic, or that Russia would be able to fly some heavy bombers across\r\nFrance for Madrid, or that Roosevelt would open his eyes and lift the\r\ndamned embargo, or anything. Any good miracle like these, even a tiny\r\none, would have saved the day. And I went to sleep every day sure that\r\neach morning I'd wake up closer to the day this miracle would happen,\r\nand that some morning I'd wake up and find that the people somewhere\r\noutside of Spain had performed this miracle.\r\n\r\n\"I remember the way Tabio listened to me speak, and how when I was done\r\nhe said that the miracle I wanted all that time was that the truth\r\nshould get to the people. It was that simple. And he was dead right.\r\nIt's exactly what he did in his own country, and you know how the people\r\nlove him for it.\"\r\n\r\nJerry looked puzzled. \"But what do you propose to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he said. \"It's a matter of days at most before the whole nation\r\nwill be mourning Tabio. The Constitution says that within thirty days\r\nafter the President dies, there must be a general election. I have an\r\nidea that the race will be between Gamburdo and someone like Lavandero.\r\nBoth will claim that they are Tabio's real choice as a successor. If I\r\ncan get to Havana, I can dig up the truth about Gamburdo and Ansaldo in\r\na matter of days. I'm sure of it. If it's anywhere at all, it's in\r\nHavana. Gamburdo is taking public credit for trying to save Tabio's life\r\nby bringing Ansaldo to San Hermano. The truth can make this boomerang in\r\nhis face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I help in any way?\"\r\n\r\nHall stopped short. \"Do you know what you're asking? That scrape in the\r\nhotel this morning was nothing compared to the things you're asking for\r\nif you stay. Even if Gamburdo is licked, it's only the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're sticking it out, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to. I've been in it since Madrid. There's no escaping it for me.\r\nI'll never know any peace until the crime of Spain is liquidated.\r\nFascism isn't just an ideological enemy for me, baby. It's a cancer\r\nburning in my own, my very personal guts. I'd go off my conk if mine\r\nweren't two of the billion fists that are smashing and will go on\r\nsmashing back at fascism until it's deader than Willie Androtten. I've\r\nnever stopped to think of what my chances are of being alive at the\r\nfinish. All I know is that if I stopped fighting it I'd die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me stay,\" Jerry pleaded. \"I'd be a liar if I said that's the way I\r\nfelt, too. But the war came to me this morning at the end of Androtten's\r\ngun, darling. I can't escape it any more than you can now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had an early dinner with Gonzales and his daughter, avoiding all\r\nserious discussion until Lavandero arrived. The Minister of Education\r\nbrought grim news: Anibal Tabio had suffered a second stroke and was\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Ansaldo?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"He is still on the ranch of Gamburdo's brother. He is waiting for an\r\nanswer to his ultimatum. Don Anibal's condition is still a secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Esteban,\" Gonzales said, \"we cannot keep it a secret. You will be\r\naccused of murdering Don Anibal if Gamburdo finds out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I've asked Segador to come. I wanted to bring Simon Tabio, but\r\nhe refuses to leave the room while his father still breathes. What do\r\nyou think, _Companero_ Hall? What is the first thing we have to do? By\r\nthe way, does the senorita speak Spanish?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I will tell her what she should know later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she reliable?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to marry her--if I am alive in three weeks.\"\r\n\r\nJerry looked at Hall's face and blushed. \"I'll bet you just told him\r\nabout us,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"My felicitations,\" Lavandero said, in English. He gave her his hand.\r\n\"But with your permission, we must speak in Spanish.\"\r\n\r\nHall told Lavandero and Gonzales his plan about Havana. \"I was going to\r\ndo it in any event if Duarte didn't hear from his friends in Mexico.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why Havana?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Havana was the base headquarters in the Western Hemisphere for\r\nall Falangist work. The boys in the Casa de la Cultura and on the staff\r\nof _Ahora_ worked with the Batista government to break it up. They\r\narrested the key leaders, but even though they had to let them go back\r\nto Spain, they took their confidential files away from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think that Ansaldo will turn up in these files?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is something we must not overlook.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is someone at the door,\" Gonzales said. \"Wait.\" He slipped the\r\nsafety of the automatic in his pocket, and went to the door with his\r\nhand on the gun.\r\n\r\n\"Be tranquil,\" Gonzales announced. \"It is Diego.\"\r\n\r\nThe Major Diego Segador who walked into the room was quite a different\r\ncreature from the mournful-visaged officer in the neat uniform Hall had\r\nmet at the barracks. He wore a gray civilian suit, whose jacket was at\r\nleast four sizes too small for his broad frame, yellow box-toe shoes and\r\nan incongruous striped silk shirt. The discolored flat straw hat he\r\ncarried in his tremendous square hands completed the picture which\r\nimmediately came to Hall's mind: a vision of Diego Segador as a tough\r\nsteel-worker on a holiday in Youngstown, Ohio, during the twenties.\r\n\r\n\"You look,\" said Gonzales, \"like a Gallego grocer on his way to High\r\nMass.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough,\" Lavandero said sharply, \"Don Anibal is dying.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to Segador's head. \"No!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Diego.\"\r\n\r\nGonzales opened a cabinet and took out a bottle of brandy. He shouted to\r\nthe kitchen for his daughter to bring glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Major,\" Hall said, \"this is Miss Olmstead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" Segador said, in English. \"You have close shave, no?\"\r\n\r\nAll the men had brandy. Jerry merely looked at the bottle with great\r\nlonging.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, Diego,\" Lavandero said, \"minutes count now. Hall has a plan.\r\nIt is a good one.\" He described it for the Major. \"If he comes back with\r\npictures of Ansaldo in the uniform of the Falange, we will have to flood\r\nthe country with them. They will not look nice next to the pictures of\r\nAnsaldo embracing Gamburdo, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will look very nice--for us. But how is Hall going to get to\r\nHavana?\"\r\n\r\n\"By plane. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Because you are a marked man, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get me to the border, then. I'll get to Havana from across the border.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your passport,\" Segador said. \"It is too risky. Tomas, you have\r\na passport, no? Never mind. All right, then, Hall. You go on a passport\r\nmade out to Vicente, but with your picture on it. I'll drive you north\r\nby car. You board a plane in San Martin Province--there's one that meets\r\nthe Clipper for Miami. The mining men use it. You travel to Havana as\r\none of our nationals, one Emilio Vicente. Then the officials of your own\r\ngovernment in San Juan won't ...\" He stopped suddenly, filled his glass\r\nwith brandy, and drank it in one short gulp.\r\n\r\n\"Out with it, Major,\" Hall said. \"What are you hiding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiding?\"\r\n\r\n\"About me and my government?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. It's just that you are too well known as Matthew Hall. You are\r\nknown by face in San Juan. Perhaps, when you land there to refuel,\r\nsomeone will recognize you. And then there will be trouble about your\r\nVicente passport. Perhaps--one cannot be too careful.\"\r\n\r\nHall knew that the Major was concealing something from him, something\r\nthat had to do with himself. He thought of his low standing at the\r\nAmerican Embassy, and of some of the fascists in high places he had\r\noffended in San Juan. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I think you are right.\" This, he\r\ndecided, was not the time to start new trouble.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Lavandero said, \"it is no good. We shall need another passport for\r\n_Companero_ Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we get it?\" Segador asked. \"There is no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is time,\" Lavandero said, evenly. \"Duarte is preparing a passport\r\nand papers for Hall. Diplomatic. He will travel as Victor Ortiz Tinoco,\r\nofficial courier of the Mexican Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did he start on the papers?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"A few hours ago. He thought you might want to make the trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me before this?\"\r\n\r\nLavandero's face softened. \"My dear friend,\" he said, \"what you are\r\nundertaking is no minor task. The complications are enormous. If you are\r\ncaught, you face much legal trouble at the very least; death by\r\nviolence, if the fascists catch you first. You are under no obligations\r\nto this Republic. I had to hear it from your lips first.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can I start?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two hours. You will have to give me your passport, so that I may\r\nhave the picture copied for the Ortiz Tinoco papers. Segador's idea is\r\nthe right one. He will drive you to the San Martin airport tonight. The\r\nMexican Embassy is ordering the tickets. I will leave you with Gonzales\r\nand Segador to work out the rest of the details.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Here is my passport.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Republic will always be grateful to you, _Companero_ Hall.\"\r\nLavandero stood up and started for the door. Hall accompanied him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Hall said, \"I'll try to get back within the week--if I'm lucky.\"\r\nHe held out his hand to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, _companero_.\" Lavandero raised his arms to Hall's shoulders\r\nand embraced him. \"You were worthy of his trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you of his love,\" Hall answered. He was sorry for Lavandero, sorry\r\nfor him as a friend, as a man, as a leader so intent on answering his\r\nresponsibilities to his moment in history that he had to allow his own\r\npersonal rages to simmer unattended within him until there again came a\r\ntime when a man could walk off alone and be his own master.\r\n\r\n\"I will see you in a week, _companero_.\"\r\n\r\nHall walked back to the living room. Segador was trying to convey to\r\nJerry his impressions of Atlantic City in 1919. \"Womans _bonitas_,\" he\r\nwas shouting, \"whisky bad. Much bad. I have young years, much money.\r\nWell, well. So.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll listen to your memoirs when I get back,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"When we get back,\" Segador said.\r\n\r\n\"You're coming with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm meeting you on your way back. We'll meet in Caracas. Listen to me,\r\n_companero_. The chief of our Air Force is loyal. He will give me one of\r\nour American bombers. From the San Martin airport, a bomber can make\r\nCaracas in fifteen hours. Give me ten hours' notice, and I will meet you\r\nin time. I already have a loyal flying crew standing by for my orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can we meet in Caracas?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the airport. I can meet your plane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you be followed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. By three or four of my picked men. Don't worry about that.\"\r\n\r\nGonzales interrupted to say that there would be time for them to have\r\ndinner at the house before starting on the drive north.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, while we're at it,\" Hall said, \"I am going to ask you to be good\r\nenough to keep my _novia_ here until I return. That is, if Segador\r\nthinks it is safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is safe,\" the Major grunted. \"We will make it safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is the privilege of my daughter and myself to make this house\r\nthe senorita's for a century.\" Gonzales called his daughter in from the\r\nkitchen. \"It will be very good for her, _amigos_. Maria Luisa is\r\nstudying English in high school. It will help her greatly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her teach Jerry Spanish in a week,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed pleased when her father told her about Jerry. \"Oh,\r\nnice,\" she said, trying out her English immediately. \"You are very\r\nwelcome, Aunt. The pleasure it is all of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind,\" Jerry said.\r\n\r\n\"Please. May I show you the room? There are five rooms upstairs in my\r\nfather's house. Your room faces the ...\" She paused, flustered, turned\r\nto Hall. \"_Como se dice, por favor, frente con vista al mar?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her that her room _faces the ocean front_, Maria Luisa. And teach\r\nher two words of Spanish for every word you learn from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" Jerry said to the girl. \"Vamoose _arriba, si_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Under no circumstances,\" Segador said when the girls were gone, \"must\r\nyou attempt to come back by regular routes. If anything happens to me,\r\nwait at the border. Get to Santiago by plane, and wait in the big hotel\r\nfor word from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How bad is it for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? The fascists are mother-raping bastards, but they are no\r\ndonkeys. Today they must be looking for you in San Hermano. In a few\r\nhours, they will begin to worry. Tomorrow they will become upset because\r\nyou are gone, and by tomorrow night they will turn the whole Cross and\r\nSword gang loose to look for you. But by tomorrow night, if all goes\r\nwell, and if that madman of a Duarte doesn't try to drive the car\r\nhimself but brings his driver along, you will be in Havana.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Segador said, \"we will do everything we can to end the\r\nhunt. But we can only do the usual things. Perhaps we will identify the\r\nbody of some poor Hermanito who gets killed by a car as Matthew Hall.\r\nGive me some papers, by the way; we'll need them if we can get the right\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lavandero has my American passport. And here's my wallet. That's good\r\nenough.\" Hall took the three photos out of the wallet. \"The pictures are\r\nfor her--if I don't come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the money?\"\r\n\r\nHall flipped his fingers through the eight hundred-odd dollars worth of\r\ntravelers' checks. \"I'd better sign these, just in case,\" he said. \"I\r\nwant you to split it between Pepe Delgado and Emilio Vicente.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" Segador said. \"Duarte is bringing some money for you to\r\ntravel on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll repay him when I return. Is there anything else I should know? I\r\nhave to write a letter. Have you any paper, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a few things,\" Segador said. \"A simple code for sending messages\r\nto us.\" He explained the code system in a few minutes. \"And one other\r\nthing. I have the pictures we took of that Nazi Vicente shot; pictures\r\nof his face and his fingerprints. We will seal them in the pouch you are\r\ncarrying. Perhaps you can identify it in Havana somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try. Ah, thanks for the paper. This will take me only a few\r\nminutes.\" Hall propped the writing pad on his lap and wrote a short note\r\nto his attorney in New York.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is it,\" he wrote, \"and I'll be more surprised than you are\r\nif you ever receive this letter. I'm about to leave this country on what\r\nmight turn out to be a one-way trip to the grave. If I don't come back,\r\nthis letter is to be sent to you. It's about my will. I still want the\r\ndough to go to the Spanish refugees and the veterans of the\r\nInternational Brigades, but I want to lop off about a quarter of the\r\ntotal in the bank and due me from Bird and leave it for Miss Geraldine\r\nOlmstead. She is an American citizen and, if you hadn't received this\r\nnote, would by now be Mrs. H. When you meet her, introduce her to my\r\nfriends and take her around to the Committee; she wants to help the\r\nSpanish Republicans. If I really thought this was my last trip, I guess\r\nI'd close this letter with some appropriate and high-sounding last\r\nlines--you know, the kind of crap a guy would write as the lead for his\r\nown obit. But we'll skip the farewell address. This letter is being\r\nwitnessed by two good friends, one a doctor and the other a major in\r\nthis country. I guess that makes it legal.\"\r\n\r\nHall signed the letter, told Gonzales and Segador what he wanted done\r\nwith it, and handed them the pen. \"How much time do we have?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to leave in less than two hours,\" Segador said. \"Duarte\r\nwill be here long before then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\" Hall looked at his watch. \"I would like to see the girl alone in\r\nher room for a while. There is much that I must tell her before I go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" Segador said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you making the trip to San Martin with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I will only ride the first twenty miles with you. I have a car\r\nwaiting for me at Marao.\"\r\n\r\nHall waited for Gonzales to call his daughter, and then he went up to\r\nJerry's room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter fifteen_\r\n\r\n\r\nHall had time to buy a paper at the Havana airport before the Panair bus\r\nstarted out for the city. In the half-light of evening, he could read\r\nonly the headlines, and the front page carried nothing about Tabio's\r\ncondition. It meant only one thing, that Don Anibal was still alive. His\r\ndeath would have rated a banner headline in every paper published south\r\nof the United States borders.\r\n\r\nHe folded the paper under his sealed attache case, sat wearily back in\r\nhis seat as the half-empty bus rolled through the flat table lands\r\nbetween the airport and Havana. It was a run of fifteen miles from\r\nRancho Boyeros to the Prado, a stretch long enough to give Hall another\r\nopportunity to review in his mind the nature of the tasks that lay ahead\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nPhysically, there were few details which could trap him. Duarte had been\r\nvery thorough, even to the point of bringing Mexican labels for Jerry to\r\nsew into every item of apparel on Hall's body and in his Mexican leather\r\ngrip. The credentials in his worn Mexican wallet had carried him through\r\nthe control stations of four governments, including the station in San\r\nJuan (although the night in Puerto Rico had been a jittery twelve hours\r\nof sulking in his room like a caged animal). He wore a hat and a pair of\r\nsoft ankle boots which belonged to Duarte, and a pair of broad-framed\r\ntortoise-shell reading glasses he had borrowed from Dr. Gonzales. The\r\nattache case, protected by the Mexican seal, contained the pictures of\r\nAndrotten, a letter from Duarte to a man named Figueroa in the Mexican\r\nEmbassy, and the automatic Segador had given him the day after he was\r\ndrugged.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to report to the Mexican Embassy and deliver the letter\r\nto Figueroa. But the Casa de la Cultura would be open (there were\r\nlectures and meetings of some sort going on every night at the Spanish\r\nRepublican society), the boys on the staff of _Ahora_ would be at their\r\ndesks at the paper, and Colonel Lobo could always be reached within a\r\nfew hours. The idea was to contact all three tonight; if the documentary\r\nbomb which would blow up Ansaldo was anywhere in Havana, it would be\r\neither at the Casa, the paper, or in the files of the Secret Police.\r\n\r\nHis heart quickened as the bus reached the narrow streets of Havana,\r\nhonked its way to the Maceo, and then turned lazily down the Prado. He\r\nloved this city as he loved only two others, New York and Madrid. In the\r\ncourse of nearly four decades, Hall had spent a mere four months in\r\nHavana, but these were months in which he rarely got more than four\r\nhours' sleep a night. He had worked hard in this city, but for a\r\nhundred-odd nights he had also known the fantastic pleasures of merely\r\nwalking the streets of the Cuban capital, talking to friends, stopping\r\noff to rest and have a tropical beer or a tall glass of mamey pulp,\r\ngetting drunk only on the green softness of the Havana moon and the cool\r\npleasures of the Gulf breeze. Here he had found old friends from Spain,\r\nand made new and life-long friendships with a host of Cubans. He knew,\r\nwhen he last left Havana, that the city had become one of his spiritual\r\nhomes, that always he would think of it as a place to which he could\r\nreturn when he wanted the peace which comes to a man from being where he\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the Panair office, Hall became apprehensive. He was\r\nafraid that he might be recognized by one of the clerks. He dug into his\r\nwallet for an American two-dollar bill and handed it to the driver.\r\n\"Take me directly to the Jefferson Hotel, _chico_,\" he said. \"It is only\r\ntwo streets out of your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't get shot if I do, _amigo_.\"\r\n\r\nHe chose the Jefferson because it was a small, ancient and very\r\nunfashionable hotel, without a bar, and completely overlooked by the\r\nAmerican colony. It was also very inexpensive, just the kind of a place\r\na new courier, anxious to make a good record, would choose. It was on\r\nthe Prado, it was clean, and the bills were modest enough to reflect to\r\nthe credit of the government traveler who submitted them. Not the least\r\nof its charms for Hall was that the Jefferson was the one place where he\r\nstood not the slightest chance of being known by either the guests or\r\nthe employees.\r\n\r\nHe signed the register with a modest flourish, insisted upon and\r\nobtained a reduced rate due to his standing as a courier, and then,\r\nspotting the large safe in the office behind the counter, he asked for\r\nthe manager. \"I am,\" he said, flourishing his identity papers, \"a\r\ncourier of the Mexican Government. Since I have arrived too late to\r\npresent myself to my Embassy tonight, could I ask for the privilege of\r\ndepositing my case in your safe for the night?\"\r\n\r\nThe manager said he would be honored to oblige. He had, he said,\r\ntraveled widely in Mexico, and admired the Mexican people, the Mexican\r\nGovernment, and most of all Senor Ortiz Tinoco's Department of Foreign\r\nRelations, and did the visitor expect to make frequent stops in Havana?\r\nThe visitor assured the manager that he did.\r\n\r\nThe case was handed to the night clerk, who opened the safe, deposited\r\nit, and closed the heavy iron door. \"It will be as safe,\" the manager\r\nsaid, \"as the gold in the teeth of a Gallego.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Hall, \"is security enough for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe got into the rickety elevator and went to his room. It was a large\r\nroom overlooking the Prado. He opened the shutters, looked out at the\r\nstar-drenched skies. He was home again. Outside, juke boxes in three\r\ndifferent open cafes on one street were playing three records with\r\nmaximum volume. A baby in the next room was lying alone and cooing at\r\nthe ceiling. Near by, a light roused a rooster on some rooftop to let\r\nout a loud call.\r\n\r\nHall heard the sounds of the city as they blended into the tone pattern\r\npeculiarly Havana's own. He took a quick shower, changed into some fresh\r\nclothes, and went downstairs to the Prado. He stopped first at a cigar\r\nstand a few doors from the hotel, bought a handful of choice cigars, and\r\nlit a long and very dark Partagas, being careful to remember that only\r\ngringos removed the cigar band before lighting up.\r\n\r\nHe walked casually down the Prado, toward the Malecon, pausing in the\r\ncourse of the four blocks between the Casa de la Cultura and the\r\nJefferson to study the stills in the lobby of a movie house showing an\r\nAmerican film, to sip a leisurely pot of coffee, and to buy a box of wax\r\nmatches and a lottery ticket from a street vendor. From the street, he\r\ncould see that the windows of the Casa were well lighted. He walked\r\nanother block, crossed the street, and then, very casually, he studied\r\nthe signs on the street entrance to the organization's headquarters.\r\n_Tonight: Lecture on History of Music by Professor A. Vasquez. Dance and\r\nball for young people._ And why shouldn't a bachelor courier on the\r\nloose in Havana attend a dance for the young _refugiados_? He went\r\nthrough the motions of a visiting blade debating with himself the\r\npropriety of attending such a ball.\r\n\r\nSquaring his shoulders, the Mexican courier put the cigar in his mouth\r\nand started to climb the stairs to the headquarters of the Casa. He\r\nclimbed slowly, afraid of receiving too enthusiastic a greeting when he\r\nreached the first-floor landing.\r\n\r\nThere was a light in the small meeting room at the end of the corridor.\r\nHall stood near the door for a few minutes, listening for a familiar\r\nvoice through the opened transom. Then, carefully, he knocked, and\r\nturned the handle of the door. It was open.\r\n\r\nHe stepped into a meeting of a small committee. Eight men were sitting\r\naround a long table. They were talking about the problems of getting\r\nhelp to the Spaniards in the French concentration camps in North Africa.\r\nAll discussion stopped the moment the confreres saw Hall.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking,\" he said, \"for Santiago Iglesias.\"\r\n\r\nA tawny-haired Spaniard at the table looked up. \"_Viejo!_\" he shouted,\r\nspringing from his chair and rushing over to confront Hall.\r\n\r\nThe right hand which rose to take the cigar from Hall's mouth also\r\nlingered long enough to hold an admonishing finger to his lips. \"Hello,\r\nRafael,\" he said. \"I didn't know you were in Cuba.\"\r\n\r\nRafael was grinning like a Cheshire cat. \"Neither did Franco,\" he\r\nlaughed. \"Last week I found out for the first time that the fascists had\r\njailed you and that you got out after the war. I thought you were dead,\r\nM...\"\r\n\r\nThe look in Hall's eyes stopped him from pronouncing the rest of the\r\nAmerican's name.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go outside,\" Hall said, softly. \"I do not have much time.\"\r\n\r\nThey stepped into the corridor. \"Where can we talk?\" Hall asked. \"Is\r\nanyone using Santiago's office?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We can sit there.\"\r\n\r\nThey found the office unoccupied. \"Don't turn the light on,\" Hall said.\r\n\"The window faces the street.\"\r\n\r\nRafael locked the door, pulled two seats close to the big desk in the\r\ncorner. \"We can sit here and talk quietly,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's wonderful to see you, Rafael. I'd heard you were captured in a\r\nhospital during the Ebro retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mierda!_ That's what the fascists boasted. No. I came out of the\r\nretreat in good order. I started with thirty men, but, instead of taking\r\nto the roads like the Lincolns, I started to cross the mountains. I went\r\nup with thirty men, and I came down on the other side with a battalion.\r\nMost of them got through alive after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy! Where have you been since then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In hell!\" Rafael spat, angrily. \"Rotting in a French concentration\r\ncamp, mostly. I organized an escape. We killed six guards, and more than\r\ntwenty prisoners got away. I got to Casablanca through the underground,\r\nand they put me on a Chilean ship. Two weeks ago we reached Havana. I'm\r\nto eat and rest for a month. Then I go back to Spain for more fighting.\r\nWith the guerrillas. When did you get here?\"\r\n\r\n\"An hour ago. Listen, I want to talk to you. But it is important that we\r\nfind Santiago. Is he in town?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He is supposed to be at our meeting. He'll be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you go back and leave word for him to join you in here the minute\r\nhe comes? It's very important.\"\r\n\r\nRafael jumped from his chair, struck an absurd caricature of military\r\nposture, and made a limp French salute, his hand resting languidly\r\nagainst his ear. \"_Mais oui, mon general_,\" he said. \"_Mais oui, oui,\r\noui._\" He marched stiffly out of the room, posing at the door to make an\r\nobscene gesture meant for the men of Vichy.\r\n\r\nHe glided noiselessly back to the dark office in a few minutes, waved\r\nHall's proffered cigar away. \"I can't smoke any more. We had nothing to\r\nsmoke the last year in Spain, and Monsieur Daladier and Company never\r\nsent us any tobacco. Now I just can't stand it. I walk around Havana and\r\neveryone offers me cigars, but I've lost my taste for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will come back, Rafael.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you in Havana, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a long story, _chico_. I'd rather tell you in front of Santiago.\r\nIt's about Anibal Tabio. I left San Hermano two nights ago. Things are\r\nserious, there. Falange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Tabio really so ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dying, _chico_. He may be dead by now. I think he was killed by\r\nthe Falange. I came here for the proof. Santiago knows. We've exchanged\r\nletters.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hola!_\" Santiago Iglesias was at the door. \"Then you got my letters?\"\r\nHe was ten years older than Rafael, tall and powerfully built. He\r\ncrossed the room in long, athlete's strides, his head thrown back as if\r\nto announce to the world that the white hairs which outnumbered the\r\nblack of his head were merely an accident of the war.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would understand,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"What happens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Anibal is dying. I think Ansaldo did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a fascist, Mateo. You were absolutely right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know? I need the proof immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a man in town who was trapped behind Franco's lines for two\r\nyears. He knew Ansaldo well.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good--for you and me. But it is not enough. There is too much\r\nat stake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed as much, Mateo. General Mogrado sent a message from Mexico\r\nCity a few days ago. He wanted the information also. I took this man in\r\nHavana and we went to a lawyer and he made a long affidavit about\r\nAnsaldo. Mogrado has the affidavit by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this man? Is he well known?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mateo. He was a minor official of the Ministry of Commerce. I have\r\na copy of his affidavit, and you can meet him tomorrow if you wish. He\r\nis staying with relatives in Marianao.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us try to see him tomorrow. But I need much more than his\r\naffidavit. I need more than anything else a picture of Ansaldo in\r\nFalange uniform, a picture that shows him with officers of Germany and\r\nItaly. I was in Burgos when the picture was taken--and I have a feeling\r\nthat the picture is right here in Havana.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here? In Havana?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, _companeros_. I saw the _Arriba_ man take that picture. I was\r\nstanding a hundred feet away. It was in the spring or summer of 1938,\"\r\nHall said. \"I know you have the complete file of _Arriba_ here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mateo. We do not.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood left Hall's head. \"You don't?\" he said. \"But when I was here\r\nwe ...\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the complete file of _Arriba_ of Madrid since April of 1939,\r\nMateo. Since Franco entered Madrid, _amigo_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And before that?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some, but not a complete file. They have many fascist papers\r\nat _Ahora_, and at the University there is Dr. Nazario with his personal\r\ncollection of fascist publications. It is very large, and it goes back\r\nto 1935 in some cases, but it has many empty places.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Secret Police? What has Colonel Lobo got?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dossiers and documents. But papers--who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be back in Madrid in a month,\" Rafael said. \"I can go back sooner\r\nif it will help the cause, Mateo. There is surely a complete file\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, Rafael, but I need the picture in a few hours.\" He told\r\nthem why the pictures were needed, and how they would be used if he\r\ncould find them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Santiago said. \"There are three collections to examine,\r\nand in the meanwhile we might get some further clues from de Sola. He is\r\na very intelligent fellow. I'll put him to work on Dr. Nazario's\r\ncollection in the morning. Rafael, tonight you go to _Ahora_. Go through\r\ntheir Spanish collection, and then examine their files of _Arriba_ of\r\nHavana. The local _Arriba_ used more pictures than an American magazine,\r\nand most of them came from Franco Spain. You'd better go right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be there in ten minutes. Shall I tell them what it's about,\r\nMateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll tell them myself. I'm here on false papers. Just warn them\r\nthat if they see me on the street I'm not to be recognized. But I'll see\r\nthem before I leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to call Lobo,\" Hall said. \"At the very least his dossiers are\r\nmore official than de Sola's affidavit.\"\r\n\r\nSantiago shoved the phone toward Hall. \"I was going to suggest it\r\nmyself. Do you remember the number?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer at Lobo's house. Hall called the headquarters of the\r\nNational Police. \"I want to reach Colonel Lobo,\" he said to the man who\r\nanswered his call.\r\n\r\n\"We no longer have a Colonel Lobo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a General Lobo, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this speaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who am I?\" Hall hesitated. \"If he's there, just tell him it's Johnny\r\nVerde Luna. He'll know who it is.\" Lobo called all Americans Johnny;\r\nVerde Luna was a horse he and Hall had played for three straight weeks\r\nat the Hipodromo until it romped home in front at the longest odds in\r\nten years.\r\n\r\n\"I will, Mr. Johnny Green Moon,\" the other man said, in English. \"When I\r\nsee him tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand you, senor. I ...\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not here, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Don't tell me where he is. But do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, my friend,\" Hall said, his voice rising angrily, \"I have\r\nno time to play games. If you know where he is, find him and give him my\r\nmessage. I'll call you every fifteen minutes until you get word from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, senor. I will do what I can. Where can I call you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. I will call you.\" Hall hung up. \"A clown!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to tell you that Lobo is now a general.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last week. It came as a reward for breaking up the Pinar del Rio\r\nNazi-Falange ring. You know, the one that was in radio contact with the\r\nGerman submarines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember it well.\" Hall had worked with Lobo in rooting the spy ring\r\nout. \"I wonder where the hell he is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? But listen, Mateo, I know a man who knows all of Lobo's\r\nhangouts. Suppose I send him out to look?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. Just tell him to give Lobo this message--that he is the only\r\nman who can save the life of Don Anibal Tabio. Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll try it. Wait here for me. I'll be right back.\"\r\n\r\nHall started to tell Santiago the whole story of his experiences in San\r\nHermano when the Spaniard returned to the office. As soon as he\r\nmentioned the fact that Ansaldo's assistant Marina was a morphine\r\naddict, Santiago interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"_Hijo de la gran puta!_ I think I know him. Wait, I'll describe him. I\r\nknow him, all right, Mateo. Wait, I'll close the shutters. Then we can\r\nturn on the light. I think I have his picture in this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he, Santiago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a second. That's better.\" He turned on the small desk light.\r\n\"Let's go to the files.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard took a set of keys from his pocket, opened a heavy door\r\nbehind the desk and snapped on the light in a small store room. He\r\nstepped in front of a row of steel filing cabinets, opened one with\r\nanother key. \"He used another name in Spain--and in Paris. I know it's\r\nthe same man. Called himself Marcelino Gassau in 1937. Wait. Here it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the _maricon_!\" Hall cried when he saw the picture Santiago drew\r\nfrom the file.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it.\"\r\n\r\nHall glanced at his watch. \"Just a second. I'm going to call Lobo back.\r\nIt's time. Let's bring the whole file on the bastard out to the desk.\"\r\n\r\nThe man at police headquarters had no news of Lobo. \"I'll call you\r\nback,\" Hall said. \"Keep trying him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So Gassau is your Marina,\" Santiago laughed. \"We knew him well, the\r\n_cabron_. He was working in Portugal and Berlin as a liaison between\r\nSanjurjo and von Faupel in 1935 and 1936. Then, when the war started, he\r\nwent to Paris, the coward, spying on the German anti-fascists who were\r\non their way to fight with the Thaelmanns in Spain. He posed as a\r\ncontact man for the U.G.T., and then he'd lead the Germans straight to\r\nthe French police and notify the German Embassy. Then the Nazis would\r\nstart to complain that they were criminals who escaped from German\r\nprisons and claim them back. Not one of the poor devils ever got to\r\nSpain, but some of them were ultimately turned over to the German\r\nGovernment and killed. It's all in this file.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else can I find here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not too much. He made a trip to Barcelona in 1937. The authorities\r\narrested him, but his friends got the British consulate to make a\r\nspecial plea for his release, and the damned fools gave in and let him\r\ngo. After that he went to Argentina, but he returned to Madrid in May of\r\n1939.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers contained a detailed record of the fascist agent's crimes\r\nagainst the Republic, and ended with a clipping from _Informaciones_ of\r\nMadrid which revealed that Gassau-Marina was one of ten men to be\r\ndecorated by the Falangist Government for distinguished service during\r\nthe three years of the war. A footnote to this list said that\r\nGassau-Marina was one of the three men decorated that day who had\r\npreviously been awarded the Order of the German Eagle, Second Class, by\r\nGerman Ambassador to Spain, General Wilhelm von Faupel.\r\n\r\n\"This will help,\" Hall said. \"It's a good start.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my phone. Just a minute.\" It was Rafael. He was calling from\r\nthe offices of _Ahora_, and he suggested that Santiago join him there.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" Hall said. \"Do we use separate cabs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a child, Mateo. You're in Havana.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd better check with police headquarters on Lobo before we leave.\"\r\n\r\nThey found Rafael in a tile-lined office on the second floor of the\r\nnewspaper building. He was sitting at a large table, three large piles\r\nof fascist publications before him, and an opened copy of the Havana\r\n_Arriba_ in his hands. \"No luck yet,\" he said. \"But Eduardo Sanchez had\r\nan idea where the picture can be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in there,\" Rafael pointed to a door. \"He's digging out some more\r\nmagazines.\"\r\n\r\nSanchez walked in with an armload of bright-colored Havana _Arribas_.\r\n\"It's good to see you again, Mateo,\" he said. \"What passes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble. How are you making out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? Are you going to stay long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm leaving tomorrow if I can get what I need.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say the picture would be in _Arriba_ for 1938?\"\r\n\r\n\"If at all, Eduardo.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's serious. There is only one place in town where I know definitely\r\nthere is a complete file of _Arriba_. It might be a little hard to get\r\ninto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The third floor of the Spanish Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"Bad, yes,\" Santiago said. He put his arms over the shoulders of Rafael\r\nand Eduardo. \"But not hopeless, eh, _companeros_?\"\r\n\r\nEduardo smiled, grimly. Rafael grinned, a sudden glint in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Rafael?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we should shoot our way in, _mi coronel_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Eduardo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. If we shoot our way in, we have to shoot our way out\r\nagain too. Maybe we'll kill a few fascists, but will we be able to get\r\nat their files?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would do us good,\" Rafael said, \"to kill ourselves a few fascists. I\r\nthink we are getting out of practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" Santiago said. \"This takes some planning. Mateo, you had\r\nbetter tell Eduardo what is at stake.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a minute. I want some water. And I'd better phone Lobo's\r\nheadquarters again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Use this phone,\" Eduardo said. \"I'll bring you water.\" He took three\r\nsheets of gray copy paper from his desk and fashioned a water cup. \"We\r\ncan't get paper cups since Pearl Harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" Santiago said. \"There is a way we can kill two birds\r\nwith one stone. Eduardo, if Hall gets the picture, it kills Gamburdo and\r\nthe Falange in San Hermano. That's one bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"The other, _companeros_, is Fernando Rivas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rivas?\" Eduardo's dark, good-looking face grew puzzled. \"Is he in this\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait. I should bring _Companero_ Hall up to date. You don't know Rivas,\r\nMateo. He is a queer bird. He comes from a good Republican family in\r\nMadrid. A very good family. Republican since before the First Republic.\r\nThis Rivas, this Fernando, he was good. Under Alfonso, he got a job in\r\nthe Foreign Office. They sent him to Havana as an attache in the\r\nlegation. Even then he was a good Republican. But something happened to\r\nthe man when the war started. He didn't fight for the fascists, but ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him about his wife,\" Rafael said.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I think did it. He had a British wife, and she had\r\nhigh-life aspirations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to go into the details. There is no time for that, anyway.\r\nThe point is that he had to go to Spain last year, and he came back\r\nfilled with loathing for everything he saw. This I know for a fact.\r\nFirst, he started to sit home alone every night and get drunk, and then\r\nhe began to write a memoir about what he saw. He didn't think anyone\r\nwould ever see it. He still doesn't know that anyone but himself has\r\never seen it. I got it from his servant one morning a few weeks ago. She\r\nis one of ours. We photographed it and she put it back before he got\r\nhome that night.\"\r\n\r\nEduardo passed a box of inexpensive cigars around. \"The week before\r\nthat,\" he said, \"I ran into Rivas at a cafe in Matanzas. He was sobering\r\nup after a drinking bout. I tried to avoid him but he followed me out of\r\nthe place. He was crying. He called himself a son of a whore mother and\r\na traitor to his honor and his people and carried on like a fool. Then\r\nhe started to tell me about his wife's lover--we've known all about that\r\nfor months, but Rivas had just found out--and I became filled with\r\ndisgust for the creature. I shook him off and left him standing in the\r\nstreet crying like a whipped dog. I hate weaklings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it,\" Hall said. \"But when you saw his diary, you started to\r\nchange your mind, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I still don't trust him. I introduced him to Santiago because Santiago\r\nwanted to meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't trust him with Franco's daughter,\" Rafael said.\r\n\r\nSantiago Iglesias sighed heavily. \"No one asks you to sleep with him,\r\nRafael,\" he said. \"It isn't that. But you remember what happened in the\r\nearly days of the war. We had to take any officer who swore loyalty to\r\nthe Republic. We had no choice in the matter, did we, _chico_?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we also put in commissars to keep an eye on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true, _chico_. But some of them proved to be really loyal, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A handful.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, even a handful. But the point is that they were useful. Here\r\nis the situation as of tonight: if the pictures which will kill the\r\nFalange in San Hermano are anywhere within our reach at all, they are in\r\nthe Spanish Embassy. We have no contact we can trust inside the Embassy.\r\nThe nearest thing to such a contact is Rivas. He is a weakling and he\r\nwas a traitor. We know that. What we don't know is whether his\r\nrepentance is sincere. The only way to really find out is to test the\r\nman. This is the time to test him. I've spoken with him three times in\r\nthe past week. He begs for a chance to prove that he has the right to\r\nserve the Republic again.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can serve the Republic best,\" Rafael insisted, \"by blowing his\r\nbrains out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rafael!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Colonel Iglesias. I hate traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't love them, _chico_. But it is not for us to put our personal\r\nlikes and dislikes before our greater duties, Major. And please\r\nremember,\" he added, smiling, \"you still are a major in the People's\r\nArmy. Neither your commission nor your Army has expired yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Rafael asked, softly. \"I will respect your\r\ncommands as my superior--and my friend.\"\r\n\r\nSantiago toyed with a thick copy pencil. \"I am going to put it to a vote\r\nright here. Who is for getting Fernando Rivas to let us into the Spanish\r\nEmbassy and removing what we need from the files? Understand, we won't\r\ntell him what we want in the files--that would be trusting him too much\r\nbefore he proves himself. Who is for raiding the Embassy with the help\r\nof Rivas? On this, Mateo, you will have to vote also.\"\r\n\r\nHall and Eduardo Sanchez raised their hands.\r\n\r\n\"Against?\"\r\n\r\nThe three men looked at Rafael. He folded his hands in his lap,\r\nostentatiously studied the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Are you against the idea, Rafael?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is crazy, Santiago. I am not afraid. I just think it is\r\ncrazy. Can't we get in without the traitor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how,\" Santiago said. \"I guess we'll have to try it without\r\nyou, Rafael.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over my dead body, my friend. I'm going with you. I've been wrong\r\nbefore, but I've never avoided a battle. I'm not ducking this one,\r\nSantiago.\"\r\n\r\nEduardo winked at Hall. \"Listen to the strategist,\" he laughed, but\r\nthere was pride and real affection in his words. \"Rafael,\" he said, \"if\r\nyou didn't shoot so straight I'd say that you talk too damned much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to hell,\" Rafael said. \"You're wasting good time. Let's finish\r\nexamining these fascist papers. Maybe we'll find the filthy picture\r\ntonight in these piles, and then we won't have to risk three, no four,\"\r\nhe looked at Hall, \"four good Republican lives on the guts of a traitor.\r\nCome on, Eduardo, get to work.\"\r\n\r\nHall motioned Santiago to the door. \"Let's go around the corner,\" he\r\nwhispered, \"and bring back a few bottles of Cristal.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly to the _cantineria_ on the corner, had some beer, and\r\nbought a dozen bottles to take back with them. Santiago said that he\r\nhoped it would not be necessary to raid the Embassy without previously\r\ntesting Rivas on less hazardous tasks.\r\n\r\n\"Personally,\" he said, \"I think Rivas is honest about wanting to come\r\nback. I think he can be trusted if we have to do it with him. But it\r\nmight mean shooting, and you cannot afford to get shot. Perhaps you had\r\nbetter not join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Don't try to cut me out, _viejo_, or I'll do it alone with Rafael.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. But I hope we find it before we have to raid the fascists.\"\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs. \"Call Fabri at your office,\" Eduardo told Santiago.\r\n\"He says he has some good news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have found Lobo.\" Santiago was right. His man had reached the\r\nGeneral. \"He says for you to meet him at headquarters in an hour. Fabri\r\nfound him at a party in Vedado. If I know Jaime Lobo, that means he will\r\nactually be back in two hours. You've got plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\nEduardo took a bottle opener from his desk. \"You'll get me in trouble,\"\r\nhe said. \"We're not allowed to drink in the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell Escalante it was my fault,\" Hall laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better sign a sworn statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow. Listen, Eduardo, there is something you must do for me.\r\nSantiago has a file on a man named Marcelino Gassau. I want the whole\r\nthing copied on microfilm, four negatives of everything in the file. Can\r\nyou have it done in your dark room tomorrow morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider it done, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\nRafael drank his beer and cursed the magazines for not having the\r\npictures of Ansaldo that Hall wanted. \"Let's get back to work,\" he said,\r\nimpatiently. \"Let's find the damned pictures if they're here.\"\r\n\r\nHall and Santiago sat down at the desk and started to go through\r\nindividual issues of various fascist publications for the year 1938.\r\nWhile they worked, Hall asked Santiago if he knew the Figueroa whom he\r\nhad to see in the Mexican Embassy.\r\n\r\n\"He is a friend,\" the Spaniard said. \"He is completely reliable. He will\r\ndo anything you ask within reason--and nearly anything that is without\r\nreason at all.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the men found the photo Hall was seeking by the time he was\r\nready to leave for General Lobo's headquarters. \"I'll get you a taxi,\"\r\nEduardo said. \"You can take a look at the AP ticker in the wire room in\r\nthe meanwhile. There might be some news on Tabio's condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe wires reported that Tabio still breathed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight when Hall crossed the threshold of the brooding\r\nstone building that was Secret Police Headquarters. Like all police\r\nheadquarters the world over, this one also smelled faintly of carbolic\r\nand damp stone, a stench Hall had grown to detest in San Sebastian. He\r\nwalked briskly down the dark corridor which led to Lobo's office.\r\n\r\nA young lieutenant was sitting at the desk in the anteroom. \"Mr. Johnny\r\nGreen Moon?\" he asked, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" Hall laughed. \"You still here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a second.\" The lieutenant pressed a button on his desk. There was\r\na click in the electric door stop of the massive oak and iron door\r\nbehind the desk. \"Go right in, Mr. Green Moon.\"\r\n\r\nHall pushed the door open, stepped into the Spartan simplicity of Lobo's\r\nprivate office, and quickly shut out the smell of carbolic by slamming\r\nthe door behind him. Lobo, who had equally good reasons for hating that\r\nodor, had installed an American air-cleaning system in his own office.\r\n\r\nThe young general--he was about three years younger than Hall--was\r\nsitting at his tremendous carved desk and studying some papers.\r\n\"Johnny!\" he shouted. \"_Que tal?_\" He was wearing a very formal white\r\ndress uniform heavy with medals and gold braid.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Jaime,\" Hall said. \"You look like an American Christmas tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnny, you dog! You took me away from a most beautiful reception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dream. Unbelievable! Four and twenty blonde Vassar girls dancing\r\naround Lobo and wondering out loud if the handsome spik speaks English.\r\nSensational!\"\r\n\r\nHall had to laugh with the general. He could easily picture the effect\r\nof Jaime Lobo's towering dark attractiveness--more than once in the\r\nUnited States Hollywood talent scouts had begged him to sign\r\ncontracts--in the eyes of the American women one could find at a lavish\r\nreception in Havana. \"An American sugar king's party?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The British business colony. It was stupendous.\" Lobo had lived in\r\nthe United States for five years, got a great kick out of scattering the\r\nsuperlatives of Hollywood in his speech when he spoke English.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" Hall said, dryly. \"It was super-colossal.\" He sat down in the\r\nlarge armchair at the side of the desk, helped himself to one of Lobo's\r\ncigars.\r\n\r\n\"So you don't want to play,\" Lobo said, sobering and taking his own\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\"Some other time, Jaime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds bad, keed. But tell me, Johnny, is it true that Don Anibal is\r\ndying?\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be dead by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ansaldo killed him?\"\r\n\r\nHall started. \"What do you know about Ansaldo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he's a fascist pig. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? For the love of God, Jaime, if you can give me the proof, we\r\ncan ...\" He told Lobo about the plans of Lavandero and the anti-fascists\r\nin San Hermano.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" Lobo said. \"I've already sent for the dossier on\r\nAnsaldo. It should be here in a few minutes. But while we're waiting,\r\nthere are a few things I'd like to show you.\" He opened the drawer in\r\nhis desk and took out an automatic wrapped in a brown-silk handkerchief.\r\n\"Take a look at this gun,\" he said, \"but don't touch. I want to save the\r\nfingerprints.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about it?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I thought you might know something about it. The hell with\r\nit. But tell me, Mateo, when did you get to town?\"\r\n\r\n\"This evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Panair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you're staying at the Jefferson, registered as Victor Ortiz\r\nTinoco, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" Hall laughed. \"That's my gun!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was your gun, _chico_. It is now Cuban Government Exhibit A in the\r\ncase against your brains. So you had it all figured out, my boy. You'd\r\ncome to Havana with fake papers, put up at an out-of-the-way hotel,\r\ncheck your gun with the hotel management, shoot the Spanish Ambassador,\r\nand then plant the gun in my back pocket and blow town on your\r\ndiplomatic Mexican passport. But you reckoned without two suspicious and\r\nsmart young second lieutenants from Oriente Province.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was my fatal mistake, chief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your accent and the cardinal stupidity of giving your attache case to\r\nthe desk clerk. He's a communist from Oriente. The weight made him\r\nsuspicious, and he called his friends in my office. Only he guessed from\r\nyour accent that you were a Spaniard, and that the gun was for the\r\npurpose of shooting up the Mexican Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what Jefferson said about eternal vigilance being the price of\r\nliberty, Jaime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Jefferson and the natural shrewdness of a peasant from Oriente\r\nProvince. Of course the minute I saw the report describing Ortiz Tinoco\r\nas a Spaniard with scars on the face, a broken nose, and big feet which\r\ntook him directly to the Casa de la Cultura, I knew it was Matthew Hall\r\nin a beard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Of course my phone calls every fifteen minutes didn't give you\r\nany idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"They helped, my boy. I'll admit that.\" He took the envelope bearing\r\nAndrotten's pictures and fingerprints from his desk. \"Who is this\r\nindividual? He looks as if he is very seriously dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I brought that envelope here for you, Jaime. He was shot three days ago\r\nin San Hermano, but I'm afraid I broke his nose before he died. That\r\nother picture of him with his family and the letter from the Dutch\r\nGovernment-in-Exile might be more interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelm Androtten? Sounds like a brand of gin. Why did you kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a Nazi, Jaime. He was trying to kill me.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lobo took some notes as he listened to Hall's account of\r\nAndrotten's role in the Ansaldo mission. \"I guess the first thing to do\r\nis to find out if the letter from Queen Wilhelmina is genuine. But it\r\nstill wouldn't prove anything. The Nazi, if he was an agent, could have\r\npicked the name Androtten from a casualty list and then written to the\r\nDutch Government in the name of the soldier's father. I'll check the\r\nphotos and the fingerprints here, and also with American F.B.I. and the\r\nBritish. The F.B.I. has been very good lately. They've helped out\r\nterrifically here with technical things.\"\r\n\r\nA green light on Lobo's desk began to flicker. \"It's the file room,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I guess they have the Ansaldo dossier.\" He called the lieutenant\r\non the inter-phone, told him to bring in the Ansaldo dossier.\r\n\r\nThe dossier was not very long. It told the story how, in the winter of\r\n1938, a prominent Cuban Falangist in the best of health had suddenly\r\ntaken to bed with a \"serious complaint.\" His family announced to friends\r\nthat they had sent to Spain for a great doctor, one Varela Ansaldo. They\r\nsaid Ansaldo cured the Cuban, to be sure, but he also had long private\r\nsessions with the leaders of the Falange at the Spanish Embassy and,\r\nbefore he returned to Franco Spain, the Falange in Cuba had undergone a\r\ncomplete shake-up of its leadership. There were pictures of Ansaldo, but\r\nalone and in plain clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Are these the only pictures?\" Hall asked.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not. We took about three thousand feet of movie film from the\r\nInspector General of the Falange for Latin America when he tried to\r\nescape to Spain on a C.T.E. ship two years ago. Let's look at them, old\r\nman.\" He pressed a key in his inter-phone box. \"Pablo,\" he barked, \"set\r\nup those Villanueva films in the machine. I'm coming in in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think of that film,\" Hall confessed. \"Every time you were\r\nsupposed to show it to me, something came up, remember?\"\r\n\r\nLobo was barking into the inter-phone again. \"Teniente, scare up two\r\ncold bottles of champagne for the theater, will you? We have a thirst\r\nthat is killing us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you screening the film in a theater?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It's a crime laboratory the F.B.I. installed for us. The whole\r\nworks. Wait till you see it, Matt. It's just like Hollywood. Colossal!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the champagne?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my own contribution. I'll be damned if I can stop drinking\r\nchampagne in the middle of a party just because Johnny Green Moon drags\r\nme out. Come on, let me show you the joint.\" He led Hall on a ten-minute\r\nCook's tour of the crime laboratory, his patter a slightly off-color\r\nimitation of an American tourist guide's spiel. A small beaded screen\r\nhad been pulled down from the ceiling, facing two chromium-and-leather\r\nlounge chairs. When the lieutenant brought in the champagne in two ice\r\nbuckets, General Lobo signaled the soldier in the tiny projection booth\r\nto start the film.\r\n\r\nThere was everything but a shot of Ansaldo.\r\n\r\n\"He was too smart, the _cabron_,\" Lobo said. \"Let's go back to my office\r\nand think it over.\" He poured what remained of the champagne into Hall's\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to his office, he asked the lieutenant to join Hall and\r\nhimself. \"Lieutenant,\" he said, \"here are some pictures and data on a\r\nman named Wilhelm Androtten, and some notes I made. Put them all through\r\nthe mill--our own files, F.B.I., the British. Check the papers and\r\nletters of Villanueva and Alvarez Garcia for any reference to Varela\r\nAnsaldo. And give me a report by noon tomorrow. Anything else you can\r\nthink of for the moment, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing. Those pictures of Gamburdo at the secret Falange dinner in\r\nSan Hermano. Remember it? I want about six microfilm negatives of each\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give them to me with your report, Lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\nThe young officer accepted the papers, saluted smartly, and left.\r\n\r\n\"There's one place in Havana where I can get that picture, Jaime,\" Hall\r\nsaid. \"The Spanish Embassy has a complete file of the Spanish _Arriba_,\r\nand I'll stake my life on that picture of Ansaldo's being in that file.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Jaime, I don't know if I'll have to examine that file. I won't\r\nknow until some time tomorrow morning. There's an outside chance that\r\nold man Nazario has the _Arriba_ we need in his collection at the\r\nUniversity. But please, Jaime, if I do have to go through the files on\r\nOficios Street, I don't want any of your excellent boys from Oriente\r\nProvince giving me a nice case of Cuban lead poisoning.\"\r\n\r\nLobo, who had opened his collar and draped his long feet over his desk,\r\nstopped smiling. He put his feet on the floor, buttoned the tunic\r\ncollar. \"You don't understand,\" he said, speaking to Hall in Spanish for\r\nthe first time that evening. \"In there, with the foolish movies, I make\r\nfoolish sayings. At the circus Lobo becomes the clown. But please\r\nremember, Mateo, that I am a Latin American. My own people were driven\r\nout of Spain by the spiritual forefathers of the Falange. I know what\r\nwill happen to Latin America if the Falange crowd wins out anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you do, Jaime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not always the playboy, Mateo. I know what my chief means to the\r\nlittle nations of the Caribbean. I know what Don Anibal means to every\r\ncountry south of Miami. I love Don Anibal. I love you because you love\r\nmy chief and my people and Don Anibal. _Claro?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Jaime. Then you'll tell your men I'm O.K.?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, my friend. I must tell them much more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. I'll try not to make any trouble. No international incidents.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't have to shoot.\" Lobo became gay again. \"Ay, Senor Ortiz\r\nTinoco,\" he sighed, \"you might want to shoot, but you are without a\r\nshooter to shoot with. My men are too good for you. They stole your\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very good men, my general.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a good chief. But look, friend, in this drawer. I have a\r\ntreasure for you.\" He emptied the contents of a canvas bag on the desk.\r\n\"Ay, Senor Ortiz Tinoco, when I relieved Jefe Villanueva of his\r\nsuper-production, I also took his gun. Such a wonderful little Swiss\r\nautomatic, built to be carried in a lady's purse or a horse's--ear. And\r\nsuch a dainty Spanish leather shoulder holster. You would be a fool not\r\nto accept this outfit in return for your gigantic cannon.\"\r\n\r\nHall took off his jacket. \"It's a deal,\" he said. \"Help me get the\r\nholster on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going when you get the picture--if you get it, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Caracas. Someone is meeting me there.\"\r\n\r\nThe General laughed. \"Caracas? Ay, we'll get you back to Caracas in\r\nstyle, _chico_.\" He opened his cigar box, held it out in front of Hall.\r\n\"By the way, Mateo,\" he said, \"I never asked you before. Are you a Red?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'm a Red, White and Blue Kid. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your government. Your embassy in San Hermano was sure that Pepe Stalin\r\nwas paying for your rice and beans. They asked your Embassy here to\r\ncheck on you with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, I told them that you were an agent. _Si_, senor! I told them\r\nthat you were a triple agent: mornings for the Kuomintang, afternoons\r\nfor the Grand Llama of Tibet, and evenings for the Protocols of Zion.\r\nYou'd better be careful when you get back to New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bastard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going now? Me, I'm going right back to that party. I\r\npromised a certain Vassar female, in my halting English, that I would be\r\nback. Can I drop you anywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to the Casa de la Cultura.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. But listen, Mateo, give me at least five hours' notice if you\r\ndecide to do any scholarly research on Oficios Street, eh? _Vamonos._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter sixteen_\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Anibal Tabio died at ten o'clock the next morning. He died on the\r\noperating table, under Ansaldo's knife.\r\n\r\nHall was in Santiago's office when Eduardo Sanchez called at eleven to\r\nsay that an AP flash had just come through in the newspaper's wire room.\r\n\r\n\"Call me when the next bulletin comes through,\" he said, slowly. \"We\r\nhave to know what Gamburdo and Lavandero are planning.\" Somehow,\r\nalthough he had known for days that Tabio's hours were numbered, it was\r\nhard to swallow his friend's dying on Ansaldo's terms. He was too\r\nstunned to wonder how Gamburdo had finally won out. For a moment, there\r\nwas a sensation of sudden emptiness; this gave way to a sense of horror\r\nand rage.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Anibal,\" he said. \"Charging the arrows of the Falange with only\r\nthe white plume of Truth in his thin hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was your friend, wasn't he?\" Santiago said. \"He was a very great\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like a drink, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, later. Call de Sola again. Tell him to hurry up. I'm going to the\r\nMexican Embassy. I have to leave an envelope with the secretary. I'll be\r\nback in less than an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bueno._\" The Spaniard walked to the door with Hall. \"There has been a\r\ngood change in you, Mateo,\" he said. \"I remember the day when such a\r\nblow would have sent you off like a wild bull. It is better to fight\r\nthem back the new way, no?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should know, Colonel Iglesias. You should know.\" Hall stopped off\r\nat a bar on the way to his hotel for a quick double brandy to steady his\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the Jefferson avoided Hall's eyes when he handed the\r\nattache case back to him. \"The senor will notice that the seal is\r\nunbroken?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is a new seal,\" Hall said. \"But be tranquil. I was present at Secret\r\nPolice Headquarters when the seal was broken. And please tell your clerk\r\nthat I am not angry with him.\" He put the case under his arm and took a\r\ncab to the Mexican Embassy.\r\n\r\nThere was more bad news when Hall returned to the Casa. The files of\r\nFranco publications kept by Doctor Nazario at the University had also\r\nfailed to produce the needed picture of Ansaldo. And a messenger from\r\nEduardo Sanchez had brought for Hall a copy of the first AP bulletin\r\nfrom San Hermano.\r\n\r\nHall read the bulletin aloud for Santiago and Rafael. \"The wily\r\nbastard!\" he said, reading how Gamburdo had decreed six days of official\r\nmourning and a national election on the seventh day following Tabio's\r\ndeath. \"'As our beloved Educator's chosen deputy and successor, I can\r\npromise the people of the Republic a continuation of the peace which was\r\nours under Don Anibal's wise leadership. I can promise that any\r\nwarmongers who would destroy this great blessing left to the nation by\r\nDon Anibal will immediately feel the wrath of the government. It was\r\nAnibal Tabio's last wish that our Republic be spared from suffering the\r\nravages of a war that is neither of our making nor of our choosing.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate politicos,\" Rafael said. \"They are a stench in the nostrils of\r\ndecent people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tabio was a politico, too,\" Santiago said, sharply. \"What else does it\r\nsay, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"It says that the Radicals and the Nationals have already nominated\r\nGamburdo. The Progressives and the Communists are meeting this afternoon\r\nto select Lavandero as their candidate, and the Socialists are asking\r\nboth candidates for guarantees against Bolshevism before making up their\r\nminds. The Traditional Nationalist Action Party--that's the Cross and\r\nthe Sword--are out a hundred per cent for Gamburdo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are the Socialists stalling for?\" Rafael shouted. \"Where\r\nare their brains?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" Santiago answered, gently, \"where is their socialism?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to this,\" Hall said. \"'The body of the President will lie in\r\nstate for six days in the Great Hall of Congress. Acting President\r\nGamburdo has ordered a hand-picked elite corps of army and navy officers\r\nto maintain a twenty-four-hour watch over the bier.' An elite corps for\r\nDon Anibal!\r\n\r\n\"And listen to this: 'In the name of the Republic, Acting President\r\nGamburdo thanked the noted surgeon, Varela Ansaldo, for his last-hour\r\neffort to save the life of the late President, and announced that he\r\nwould recommend to the Congress that Dr. Ansaldo and his assistant, Dr.\r\nMarina, be given formal decorations. Gamburdo revealed that Ansaldo, who\r\ncame to San Hermano at his urgent pleas, left the mourning capital at\r\nnoon on the first leg of a flying voyage to Lisbon where he is to\r\nperform a delicate operation on a prominent jurist.'\"\r\n\r\n\"They got away!\" Rafael said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not so bad,\" Hall said. \"That is, it won't be if ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Mateo. If we can pin the arrows on Ansaldo after this\r\nstatement,\" Santiago said, \"it will be very hard for Gamburdo to explain\r\nto anyone. Especially since you have that picture of Gamburdo at the\r\nsecret Falange dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have more than that. I have a copy of the report the Inspector\r\nGeneral of the Falange made about Gamburdo at that dinner, and it's\r\nwritten on official stationery. We've just got to get more on Ansaldo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you still against raiding the Embassy, Rafael?\"\r\n\r\n\"I changed my mind. When do we do it? Tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Rafael, you'll have to find Dr. More. I think you'll catch\r\nhim in at the clinic now. Tell him to get Rivas and bring him to his own\r\nhouse in Vedado.\"\r\n\r\nHall took out his wallet. \"Here, Rafael, you'll need money for taxis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy, Mateo? This is a hundred-peso note.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll also need a new suit. They won't let you into the Spanish\r\nEmbassy in those clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll buy my own clothes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rafael,\" Santiago said, gently, \"Hall is our _companero_.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy began to blush. \"I am sorry,\" he stammered, \"but it is not my\r\nway to accept such offers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't offer it to a man,\" Hall said. \"I gave it to an officer of the\r\nPeople's Army. It is money intended to aid that army in its fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, Rafael,\" Santiago said. \"We will argue after we get out of\r\nthe Embassy--if we get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to see Lobo,\" Hall said when Rafael left. \"I've got to tell\r\nhim to ask the American Intelligence Service to check on Ansaldo's\r\nmovements in Lisbon. I don't think he is going to operate on any\r\nPortuguese jurist or anyone else in Lisbon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll make a fool of yourself, Mateo. You're not dealing with stupid\r\nSpanish fascists like Franco and Gil Robles. You're dealing with the\r\nGerman Nazis who run the Falange. I know them. They're too smart not to\r\nhave a patient waiting in bed for Ansaldo when he gets to Lisbon. Why\r\ndon't you see Lobo after our conference with Rivas? In the meanwhile,\r\nI'd better get statements from de Sola and Carlos Echagaray on Ansaldo\r\nand Marina.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeeting Fernando Rivas in the home of the Cuban doctor, Hall was\r\nreminded of what an acid-tongued Czech journalist said to him at Geneva\r\nabout Chautemps, a French politician. There was nothing wrong with the\r\npolitician, the Czech said, except that he had the face of a traitor. In\r\na city where the sun always shined, Rivas had the pallor of a skin which\r\nnever saw the sun. He sat tensely at the edge of the chair in More's\r\nstudy, hands working a battered Panama, his puffy eyes darting furtive\r\nlooks at Rafael and Hall, men he had never seen before but whom he\r\nobviously suspected of being agents of the Republican underground. Hall\r\nthought: this is a man who can no longer know hate or love or anything\r\nbut fear.\r\n\r\nIt was Santiago's show. He ran it on his own terms. From the outset, he\r\nmade it clear that he, or rather the Republic for which he spoke, was\r\ngiving the orders. They were given decently, temperately, but not\r\nwithout the proof that force lay behind the commands. Rivas was to\r\naddress him as Colonel. \"And these,\" he said, indicating Rafael and\r\nHall, \"are my aides, Majors Juan and Pancho.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want of me, Colonel? There is nothing I would not do for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"For whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the--for the Republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Republic?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Republic of Spain. The Republic of the Constitution of 1931.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should the Republic trust you now, Rivas?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason, Colonel. I can ask only in the name of my family.\"\r\n\r\nRafael had seen the older brother of Rivas die charging a German battery\r\nnear Bilbao. \"It is not your privilege,\" he said. \"I knew your brother.\"\r\nHall laid a restraining hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"You betrayed your family when you betrayed your people,\" Santiago said,\r\nsoftly. \"It is not good enough. I must have a better reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"State your own terms,\" Rivas said. \"I will meet them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe traitor took out a silk handkerchief, mopped his face. He suddenly\r\nseemed to grow, to straighten his back. His head held high, he looked\r\neach man proudly in the eyes. A moment earlier, his hands, his lips had\r\nbeen quivering. Now they were firm and still. \"Why?\" he repeated in a\r\nnew, stronger voice. \"Why?\" He was fighting for one last chance,\r\nfighting with his remaining reserve of dignity. \"I'll tell you why, my\r\nColonel. Because I don't care whether I live or not. But I want to die\r\nas a Spaniard, as a free man again. I want to die as a Republican. Is\r\nthat reason enough?\"\r\n\r\nColonel Santiago Iglesias was not a cruel person. He hated to play cat\r\nand mouse with a human being, even with such as Rivas. But his first\r\nresponsibilities were to the Republic. \"I hardly think so,\" he said,\r\nspeaking as an officer, although as a man he knew that Rivas had stated\r\na good reason, because he knew the reason to be true. \"I hardly think\r\nso, Rivas,\" he said. \"Merely because the wife of a man who betrayed the\r\nRepublic turns out to be a whore is no reason for the Republic to love\r\nhim more.\"\r\n\r\nFernando Rivas bent forward, as if he were trying to ward off a heavy\r\nseries of blows. \"No,\" he said. \"It is not reason enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe thin body of Rafael Abelando shook with silent laughter for a\r\nmoment, and then it became still. The young major turned to Santiago,\r\nhis face filled with a sudden pity for the wreck of a man in the chair.\r\nHall caught the look, too, the admission of something Rafael would have\r\ndied rather than say out loud. The boy was ready to give the traitor\r\nRivas his last chance. It was the moment Santiago had been waiting for;\r\nwithout Rafael's implicit confidence in his plan, he had all but decided\r\nto call it off.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Pancho?\"\r\n\r\nHall nodded agreement.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Major?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell with what I think. I'll do my thinking later. If he comes\r\nthrough, I'll tell you what I think. If he funks out on us, I'll slit\r\nhis throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Rivas,\" Santiago said. \"We will give you your chance. We\r\nneed your help tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I come armed? I am an expert marksman, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We shall carry the arms. You shall carry the key--or the keys. We\r\nwant to get into the third floor of the Embassy, and we want to get out\r\nalive--and without shooting. Can it be done?\"\r\n\r\nRivas raised his head, stared into the faces of the three men who held\r\nopen the gates of the Republic. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"It might take\r\nsome planning, gentlemen, but it can be done.\" He held out his hand to\r\nSantiago. The colonel accepted it.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you are with us,\" Santiago said. \"In a sense, you are the\r\nmost fortunate of the four of us. You see, Rivas, if we should all get\r\nkilled tonight, yours would be the most lasting memorial.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why me, Colonel?\"\r\n\r\nSantiago picked a heavy manila envelope up from the floor. He took out\r\nthe photographs of the memoir on Franco's Spain that Rivas had written\r\nin his own hand. \"You see,\" he said, \"if we should all die tonight, the\r\nCasa de la Cultura will publish your excellent memoir--with a postscript\r\nabout your heroic sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" Rivas gasped. \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are surprised, Rivas? Please let me assure you that there are many\r\nof us. We are everywhere where _they_ are. _Claro?_\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\" For a fleeting moment Rivas had been back with the\r\nRepublic, a free man among free men. Now he was again a prisoner, but\r\nwith two jailers--Franco and the Republic. Now the Republic could force\r\nthe other to destroy him. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I understand.\" The Republic,\r\nhe knew, gave him his choice of executioners or his opportunity to fight\r\nfor his freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful,\" he said. \"I am grateful for the chance to belong to the\r\nRepublic again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. We must plan. Shall we drink on it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a decanter of Scotch whisky on Dr. More's sideboard. Santiago\r\nfilled four glasses to the brim, then called for and filled a fifth\r\nglass. \"It is for the other who will be with us tonight,\" he said.\r\nEduardo was getting the affidavit on Ansaldo from the exile in Marianao.\r\n\r\n\"To the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nHall watched Rivas drink his Scotch in one greedy, hysterical gulp. He\r\nquietly filled the man's glass, shoved the bottle toward him. Rivas\r\ndowned the second Scotch, reached for the bottle, then changed his mind\r\nas his hand was in mid-air.\r\n\r\n\"Paper,\" Rivas said. \"The desk. I must draw a floor plan of the\r\nEmbassy.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock, Rivas let Santiago and his three friends into the\r\nSpanish Embassy through the rear door.\r\n\r\nAt ten-thirty, a large but unscheduled military parade started winding\r\nthrough the streets of Old Havana. No one seemed to know what the parade\r\nwas about, but the soldiers in the ranks thought that it had something\r\nto do with a surprise party being given to General Jaime Lobo to\r\ncelebrate his promotion in rank. It was his old regiment which had been\r\ncalled out at nine that night and ordered into parade formation.\r\n\r\nAt ten forty-five, the paraders were halted for some reason, and the\r\nGeneral's runners motorcycled down along the line of march and told the\r\nbandmasters to keep on playing the liveliest of tunes. The order reached\r\nthe second band in the line just as it stopped in front of the Spanish\r\nEmbassy.\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered to listen to the band and watch the parade. Santiago,\r\nHall, Rafael and Eduardo casually detached themselves from this crowd at\r\nprecisely eleven.\r\n\r\nRivas led them quietly up the back stairs. The blare of the brasses, the\r\nbooming of the drums, the crashing of the cymbals penetrated every\r\ncorner of the Embassy. \"God is with us,\" he said. \"The noise is\r\nwonderful.\"\r\n\r\nHall bit his tongue. A fat lot God had to do with it! He was crawling\r\nbehind Santiago, the Swiss automatic in the right hand cocked at his\r\nhip. Eduardo was behind him, and ahead of Rafael. \"Third floor,\" he\r\nwhispered. \"We turn left at the head of the stairs and climb three\r\nsteps.\"\r\n\r\nSantiago pulled out his gun as they approached the third-floor landing.\r\nHe allowed Rivas to get a few steps ahead of him, to take the three\r\nsteps which led to the library. \"Go in with Rivas,\" he whispered to\r\nHall. \"You too, Eduardo.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed Rivas into the dark room. He was standing near a draped\r\nwall, motioning to them to follow him quietly. \"Behind the drape,\" he\r\nsaid. Eduardo closed in next to him. He frisked him for hidden knives or\r\nguns. \"Don't move,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSantiago joined Eduardo and Hall. \"Rafael is covering the door,\" he\r\nsaid. He motioned to Rivas to approach the drape. Eduardo remained at\r\nthe traitor's heels, the gun in Rivas's back. Hall knew what to do. He\r\nwaited until Santiago flattened himself out against the wall which\r\nparalleled the drape, then he quickly drew the cloth to one side. He\r\nfound himself facing a large steel cabinet built into the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Open.\" Santiago's fingers twirled an imaginary dial before his nose.\r\n\"Open it, Rivas.\"\r\n\r\nThe frightened man who was both host and hostage raised his hand slowly,\r\nfingered the dial, dropped his hand in disgust. He dried his sopping\r\nfingers against the front of his jacket, tried again. The tumblers of\r\nthe lock rose and fell; the lock remained closed. Santiago slowly\r\nreleased the safety catch of his pistol. \"What passes?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ssh,\" Rivas pleaded. \"I'll try it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait.\" Hall held a small bottle of brandy up to Rivas's face. \"Take a\r\ndrink. It will steady your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's coming, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\nSantiago looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch; eight minutes\r\ngone. The band would not be under the window all night. He beckoned to\r\nHall. \"That white door near the window, Mateo. He says you will find the\r\n_Arribas_ in there perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's opened the steel door,\" Eduardo said.\r\n\r\n\"Keep him covered.\" Santiago stepped in front of Rivas, opened the door\r\nas wide as it would swing. He faced a multitude of locked steel drawers.\r\n\r\n\"Let me,\" Eduardo said. He changed places with Santiago. He was good at\r\npicking such picayune locks; the concentration camp on the Isle of Pines\r\nwas full of native fascists whose careers ended when Eduardo jimmied\r\nopen the locks that protected their secrets. He could crack them open\r\nswiftly, almost noiselessly.\r\n\r\n\"There's one,\" he whispered. \"Two.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a talent,\" Santiago said to Rivas.\r\n\r\nHall glided over to the white door of the closet. Like the others, he\r\nwore soft-soled rubber shoes. He took a small oil can from his pocket,\r\nsaturated the hinges and the handle of the white door. Slowly, he opened\r\nthe wooden door. A book balanced precariously on an upper shelf behind\r\nthe door started to fall. He grabbed it with his left hand. A rash of\r\ninvisible pimples spread over his scalp. Too much noise that time, even\r\nthough the book didn't fall. He held his breath, counted to twenty. The\r\nband was still blaring, the drums pounding away. Good old God!\r\n\r\nHe ran the slim beam of the dime-store flashlight over the shelves.\r\n_Informaciones, A.B.C._, ah, here, _Arriba_! He turned to signal to\r\nSantiago that he had found it, but the colonel had again changed places\r\nwith Eduardo, was now emptying documents from the little steel drawers\r\nto the inside of his shirt.\r\n\r\nRafael, standing guard at the doorway, wildly signaled Hall to get to\r\nwork on the files. He pointed vigorously to the non-existent watch on\r\nhis narrow wrist.\r\n\r\nHall dug into the _Arriba_ pile. He pulled the top of the 1938 batch to\r\nthe floor, sat down in front of them. April. May. June. Not here.\r\nImpossible! He sneaked the remainder of the brandy into his throat. Once\r\nagain. April. He looked at Santiago, working calmly; light flickering\r\nover the papers in the drawers, eyes selecting the wheat from the chaff.\r\nThe problem is April. It happened in April, 1938. Easy does it. April\r\nOne. April Two. Three. Four. Seven. Nine. No. No. Not yet.\r\n\r\nSantiago was in the middle of the room, his hands crammed with papers.\r\nHe beckoned to Rafael, stuffed batches of papers into the major's shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Got the bastard!\" Hall said. He forgot to whisper. He climbed to his\r\nfeet, a yellowing newspaper in his hands. \"Got it!\"\r\n\r\nA door opened on the floor above. \"Rivas?\" someone on the fourth-floor\r\nlanding called.\r\n\r\nRafael was still in the room. Santiago held his shoulder, shook his\r\nhead. Stay here, he motioned. He signaled for Rivas, handed him his own\r\ngun. He pointed to the third-floor landing, smiled at the man.\r\n\r\nThe four men in the room covered the back of Fernando Rivas as he\r\nadvanced toward the landing, the warm gun gripped firmly in his sweaty\r\nhand. They watched him stick his head out of the door, say, hoarsely,\r\n\"Yes. It's all right,\" the gun hidden behind his thigh.\r\n\r\n\"What's all the noise?\" Fourth Floor again.\r\n\r\n\"Parade.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there?\" No suspicion--just conversation. Anyone\r\ncould see Fourth Floor only meant conversation. Anyone but Rivas. To a\r\nman, the four behind Rivas prayed he would stall off the man above him\r\nwith a polite nothing.\r\n\r\n\"None of your business, you fascist pig!\"\r\n\r\nOver and above all the noises of the city, of the band on the corner, of\r\nthe hearts thumping in the breasts of the four men in the room there\r\nfell a whining silence which was both hours long and seconds short. Then\r\nthe silence was shattered by the crashing explosions of two heavy\r\npistols.\r\n\r\n\"Let me.\" Rafael ran to the doorway, flattened out against the wall. His\r\neyes took in the prone body of Rivas at the landing and the heap of man\r\nsprawled on the stairs. Rivas was dead. His gun lay near his head. The\r\nman on the stairs still held onto his gun. Rafael reached behind him for\r\nthe silent weapon, the weapon you used on lone forays into enemy\r\nterritory, on guards in concentration camps.\r\n\r\nThe knife flashed over his head, pinned the hand with the pistol to the\r\nwooden stairs. Behind the knife flew Rafael. Once again the blade was\r\nraised, this time with a hand still on it as it descended.\r\n\r\nEduardo pulled Hall's sleeve. \"Quick,\" he said. \"The stairs. Follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Rafael said to the dead Rivas, \"now you're a Republican.\"\r\n\r\nThe watch on Santiago's wrist read 11.29 when Rafael, the last man to\r\nleave, melted into the crowd around the band. People on the sidewalk\r\ncould hear feet pounding heavily through the large empty rooms of the\r\nEmbassy. Lights were going on in all the dark windows. Yells. A woman's\r\nscream.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the parade, a baton twirled. The uniforms started to move\r\nforward. The crowd on the sidelines followed the band.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, sitting in Lobo's office, the mass of documents from the shirts\r\nof Santiago and Eduardo and Rafael on the desk before the general, Hall\r\nremembered his outcry when he found the picture of Ansaldo and the Axis\r\nofficers giving the fascist salute. My \"got it!\" got poor Rivas, he\r\nthought. I'm still an amateur at it. Santiago was good; found dynamite,\r\nbut he kept his mouth shut. Eduardo was good; cracked the locks and kept\r\nhis mouth shut. Rafael was good; finished off the bastard from the\r\nFourth Floor in seconds, and remembered to use a knife, and kept his\r\nmouth shut until it was all over. Funny the way he stood over what\r\nremained of Rivas and said, \"All right, now you're a Republican.\"\r\nMocking, yet respectful. It was good; no forgiveness for the dead man's\r\ntreachery but respect for his insane courage.\r\n\r\n\"It was a nice band concert, yes?\" Lobo said. \"Plenty of bim bam boom in\r\nthe drums. Tsing! Tsing! Cymbals. Tarantara, tarantara.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a one-man band, eh, keed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Colossal.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's eating you, Matt? That little slob who killed himself with his\r\nbig mouth?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my fault, Jaime. It was my big mouth.\"\r\n\r\nThe General picked up a fistful of the documents which had cost the life\r\nof Fernando Rivas. \"What the hell is his life worth compared to the\r\nlives of the hundreds of American seamen who now won't be sent to the\r\nbottom by Nazi torpedoes in the South Atlantic? I'll say it again, Matt,\r\nand if you'd stick around long enough, I could prove it. By tomorrow\r\nmorning I'll have at least twenty mucking bastards in the calabozo\r\nthanks to what's in these papers; twenty fascist snakes who are the eyes\r\nand the ears and the oil and the water of the Nazi subs in this part of\r\nthe ocean. You did it--and at the cost of only one second-rate life.\r\nIsn't it worth it?\"\r\n\r\nHall was going through the documents on the desk. Bombshells, most of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n     _Mandato # 36: 1940. From: Inspector-General Delegacion\r\n     Nacional, del Servicio Exterior, de Falange Espanola\r\n     Tradicionalista de las J.O.N.S.

Signed ...\r\n\r\n\"Photograph these, will you, Jaime?\"\r\n\r\nLobo was sorting out the documents in rough piles. Sabotage. Espionage.\r\nUndersea warfare. Guantanamo. Cuban politics. \"The works,\" he grinned.\r\n\"In a week, this haul will have crammed our prisons with fascist rats.\r\nIf we didn't have to avoid treading on the toes of your State Department\r\nthese documents would be enough to put the Spanish Ambassador in the\r\ncalabozo and bring about a break with Franco. But even if it happens,\r\nyou won't be around to see it, Matt. You're leaving in exactly four\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute. That's my private phone. Yes, General Lobo speaking.\" He\r\nput his hand over the mouthpiece. \"Pick up the other phone. It's the\r\nSpanish Ambassador.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Ambassador?\"\r\n\r\n\"General! Something terrible has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's been a murder in the Embassy. Someone broke into the Embassy\r\nand shot one of our attaches. Communists, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead? When did this all happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nHall and Lobo looked at the wall clock. The hands showed ten minutes\r\nafter one.\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes or hours, Mr. Ambassador?\"\r\n\r\n\"Minutes, General. It just happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the stairs. The back stairs, between the third and fourth floors. It\r\nis terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elicio Portada, General Lobo. Poor Portada!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute.\" He put his hand over the mouthpiece. \"Listen to those\r\nlies, will you? Only one body. Three hours to dispose of the Rivas\r\ncarcass and search the files. Did you leave them in much of a mess,\r\nMatt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" The hand came away from the phone. \"Hello. Yes,\r\nthis is still General Lobo. Mr. Ambassador, I have very serious news for\r\nyou. As the representative of a friendly neutral, I am sure we can count\r\non your co-operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, General?\"\r\n\r\n\"We happen to have incontrovertible evidence that the late Elicio\r\nPortada was connected with a Nazi-Falange ring in direct contact with\r\nGerman submarine fleets in these waters. My immediate deduction is that\r\nhe was killed by members of this ring to keep him from confessing to us.\r\nHe was on the verge of making a complete confession.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? It is preposterous! I shall protest to the Foreign Minister!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suit yourself, senor. Our evidence is incontrovertible. In the\r\nmeanwhile, thanks to your attitude as you now express it. I must remind\r\nyou that while the crime was committed on what is legally Spanish\r\nterritory, if you move the body one inch out of the Embassy grounds you\r\nwill be moving it on to Cuban national territory. Do you understand me?\r\nNot one body is to be moved out of the Embassy without my consent. Not\r\none body, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"My government shall protest your interference, General Lobo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them. I'm sending two men over to the Embassy. Tell them what\r\nhappened. And make up a list of all of Portada's friends. We'll find the\r\nmurderer on that list, I'll warrant.\" He hung up the telephone with a\r\nslam.\r\n\r\n\"Let him sleep that off,\" he laughed. \"My super-dooper crime laboratory\r\nwill prove that the Ambassador lied about the time of the shooting. My\r\nsuper-sleuths will find bloodstains on the third-floor landing--and I\r\nhope to Christ Rivas has a different blood type than Portada. My\r\nsuper-sleuths will keep a straight face when the fascists hand them the\r\ngun of the missing murderer. Then my colossal courtesy-of-the-F.B.I.\r\ncrime laboratory will find Rivas's fingerprints on the gun. Mystery:\r\nwhere is Rivas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got his fingerprints?\"\r\n\r\n\"Teniente,\" Lobo shouted into the inter-phone, \"send those Einsteins of\r\ncrime to the home of Fernando Rivas of the Spanish Embassy. Bring back\r\nfingerprints: best place to find them is liquor bottle, razor, hair\r\nbrush--and do it fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good going.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll teach that fascist bastard to tell me nursery tales on the\r\ntelephone at one in the morning.\" Lobo was growing genuinely indignant.\r\n\"God, how I wish you didn't have to leave town, Matt. I'm going to be\r\nrunning a circus for the next two weeks!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take a rain check on it, Jaime. Maybe I can come back in time for\r\nthe closing day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" Lobo sent for his aide, ordered microfilm copies of the\r\ndocuments to be ready in four hours. \"And bring me the special belts and\r\nharnesses, Teniente.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you get me a seat on a Panair plane? I thought Figueroa would take\r\ncare of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than that, my boy.\" Lobo crossed the room, opened a panel in the\r\nwall. It revealed a closet filled with uniforms. \"Get into one that\r\nfits, Mateo. I have a seat for you on a Flying Fortress headed for\r\nCaracas.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yanqui?_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yanqui._ You're traveling as Major Angel Blanco of my confidential\r\nstaff. You are going south for me on a most delicate mission. You speak\r\nvery little English, and you stink from pomade. Besides, you wear these\r\nthick glasses and you've been out on such a night of wild Latin\r\ndebauchery that you sleep most of the time. In short, you are the\r\nAnglo-Saxon's dream of the stupid, conceited, lecherous Latin officer\r\nwho can't hold his liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Claro._ I'm repulsive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you are also a walking microfilm file, only no one knows it.\r\nYour belt, your Sam Browne harness, the lining of your short boots, the\r\ninside of the visor of your cap are filled with identical sets of\r\nmicrofilms. Your pouch carries a letter from me to a General XYZ in\r\ncode--and God preserve the sanity of anyone who attempts to uncode it.\r\nIt will add up to precisely three tons of _mierda de caballo_.\"\r\n\r\nHall found a uniform that fit him. He got into it, smeared the proffered\r\npomade into his black hair. \"Do I carry any baggage?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll pack you a bag. Two extra uniforms, pictures of your wife, your\r\nmistress, and your mother, a pound of pomade, a few copies of the\r\n_Infantry Journal_--it will be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine. But before I go, Jaime, there's something I don't quite\r\nget. Why did the Spanish Embassy crowd have to hide Rivas's body? Why\r\ncouldn't they admit that he did it?\"\r\n\r\nLobo adjusted Hall's tunic. \"Elementary, my dear Watson,\" he said. \"The\r\nPortada blighter was sleeping with the Rivas bloke's wife. It's the\r\nAmbassador's job to avoid scandals within the happy family. Admitting\r\nRivas killed Portada over a rag, a bone, and a hank o' hair would be a\r\nconfession the Ambassador couldn't run his own show. Elementary?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You're improvising, and the notes sound all wrong. Let me know\r\nabout it when you really find out, Sherlock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back in two weeks.\" General Lobo yawned, stretched his long frame.\r\n\"I'll take you to the American air base myself,\" he said. \"I'll\r\nintroduce you and act as your interpreter. And after you take off,\r\nyou'll be on your own. Who's meeting you in Caracas, by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Major Diego Segador. Know him?\"\r\n\r\nLobo smiled. \"You'll get through,\" he said. \"Segador has nine lives,\r\neach of them tougher than the side of a battleship. Ask him to tell you\r\nwhat we did to those three Nazi heavyweights in San Souci in '39. _Madre\r\nde Dios_, Mateo, it was carnage!\"\r\n\r\nTwenty steps down the corridor, a Negro technician was focusing a sharp\r\nlens on page three of _Arriba_ for April 27, 1938. The picture which\r\nspread across four columns of the top of the page was remarkably like\r\nthe picture Hall had carried in his mind since that day with Jerry in\r\nSan Hermano. The fans in the negative dryer were whirring over\r\ntwenty-odd other negatives. Lobo was right, Hall realized. They were\r\nworth the life of one Rivas, they might yet take the life of a Hall. The\r\nstakes were worth the risk. Kill the beast in San Hermano, drive a knife\r\ninto its arteries, keep it from crawling north and its foul breath\r\nbeginning to stink up the clean air. Kill, so you can live again, kill,\r\nso you can go back to Ohio when the beast was dead, and have children\r\nand not worry that some day they'd have to kill or be killed too. Kill\r\nfor the same reasons the Rafaels and the Santiagos and the Lobos kill\r\nand you'll never have to lose a night's sleep.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of the girl I'm going to marry in two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hijo de la gran puta!_ He's in love, too! Let's go to the laboratory.\r\nWe've got a lot to do before you go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter seventeen_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Army plane banked sharply over the blacked-out Caracas\r\nfield. Three times the four-motored ship circled the airport, breaking\r\nits speed, rousing the men who controlled the lights along the correct\r\nrunways. During the second time around, Hall thought he saw a Douglas\r\nwith the bright green-and-white flag on its wings. He was not so sure\r\nthe third time.\r\n\r\nThe pilot brought his ship in gently. It rolled down the new concrete\r\nstrip, a silver juggernaut in a cloud of red dust. Hall climbed out,\r\ngave the captain a silver cigarette case as a souvenir of the trip. The\r\nplane was not through for the night; it was to take on more fuel and\r\nproceed to a base farther south.\r\n\r\nHall went to the small operations building. He showed his papers to a\r\nsleepy official, had his passport stamped. \"That Douglas on the other\r\nend of the field,\" he said to the official, \"is that the plane from San\r\nHermano?\"\r\n\r\nThe official didn't know. He offered to find out. \"It is not of\r\nimportance,\" Hall said. He left his bag with the official. \"I will be\r\nready to go to the city as soon as the American plane takes off. Is that\r\ncar for me?\"\r\n\r\nHe went out to the field, stood chatting with the American flying\r\nofficers as they stretched their legs and smoked while their plane was\r\nreadied for the next leg of their flight. The boys were an agreeable\r\nsurprise, or they had a C. O. with brains; each of them spoke some\r\ndegree of Spanish, and to a man they were polite to the \"Cuban officer\"\r\nwho had made the trip with them. It was a decent, non-condescending\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to ask General Lobo to thank you all for your kindness,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You are, as they say in English, _damn regular guys_!\"\r\n\r\nThe young captain, who had given Hall his life history and his Seattle\r\nhome address, was touched. \"Aw,\" he said, \"we're just ordinary Yanks,\r\nMajor Blanco. Don't forget to look me up if you ever get to Seattle\r\nafter the war. Then I'll show you some real hospitality. _Entiende?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand perfectly, Captain. And you must visit me, too. You\r\ncan always reach me through General Lobo.\" Hall, who had calmly\r\nappropriated the story of Lobo's boyhood and palmed it off on the\r\ncaptain as his own during the flight, began to laugh. \"Oh, yes,\r\nCaptain,\" he said, \"we will have the most amazing reunion after the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the American pilot said, \"we're shoving off now.\"\r\n\r\nHall exchanged salutes and handshakes with the Fortress crew. \"_Hasta\r\npronto_,\" he shouted, as the last man climbed aboard. He remained where\r\nhe stood, waving at the Americans, when he saw the outlines of Segador's\r\nthick shoulders emerging from the lighted doorway of the administration\r\nbuilding. Segador was walking toward the Douglas.\r\n\r\nHe approached Hall, glanced at the Cuban uniform for a second, and\r\ncontinued on his way to the parked plane. There was no hint of\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" Hall said to Segador, \"have you a match, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Major, I see the stamp of the government match monopoly. Would you\r\nbe from San Hermano, by any chance?\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkness, Segador's hand crept toward the huge pistol in his\r\nholster. Hall held the unlighted match in his fingers. It was\r\nunbelievable; he was still unrecognized. He had been speaking to Segador\r\nin a disguised voice. \"It is a very black night,\" he said in his normal\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, but it's major. Major Angel Blanco of the Cuban Army,\r\nsenor.\" Then he struck the match, held it close to the cigar in his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"_Madre de Dios!_ It's you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who the hell did you think it was, Diego? Wilhelm Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a fool. But the uniform, the glasses--this confounded\r\nblackness....\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the plane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We can't take off until morning. I can't trust the night flying\r\ninstruments. Was it worth the trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"_In spades_,\" he said, in English.\r\n\r\n\"It was successful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much, Diego. I found the picture. I found other things.\" He told\r\nhim about the documents on San Hermano which Santiago had taken from the\r\nsteel boxes. \"If we stand behind the plane can we be seen by anyone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only by my men in the cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\" They walked farther into the blackness, put the plane between\r\nthemselves and any eyes that might be watching them from the field\r\nbuildings. \"Quick,\" Hall said, \"give me your belt and take mine. It is\r\nloaded with a complete set of negatives.\"\r\n\r\nThe exchange was completed in seconds. \"I've got three duplicate sets\r\nhidden on my person,\" Hall said. \"Now they'll have to kill both of us to\r\nstop the truth from reaching San Hermano.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sleeping in the plane,\" Segador said. \"You had better sleep in\r\ntown. Did you arrange for a hotel, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lobo arranged a room for me through the Cuban Legation. There's a\r\ndiplomatic car at the gate now, waiting to take me to town. What time do\r\nwe start out?\"\r\n\r\n\"A minute after sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be here. Can I bring anything from the hotel? Hot coffee? Beer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We have everything. Even,\" he looked up at the plane and smiled,\r\n\"even machine-gun belts.\"\r\n\r\nHall followed his eyes. He found himself facing the twin barrels of the\r\nmachine guns in the side panel of the Douglas. There was a young soldier\r\nat the firing end of the guns.\r\n\r\n\"You do well, Sergeant,\" Segador said. \"At ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he use them, Diego?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a fantastic shot, that boy. He was in Spain. But you will meet\r\nhim tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. But tell me one thing, if you can. It's been bothering me\r\nfor days. How did Ansaldo...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't. I hate to think of it, Mateo. The fascists put us all in a\r\nbottle. _El Imparcial_ ran a big story on the front page--they charged\r\nthat Don Anibal's only chance for life lay in an operation by Ansaldo.\r\nThey also hinted that selfish politicians were tying Ansaldo's hands.\r\nThe Cabinet had to capitulate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lavandero?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Anibal! What was it that finally killed him?\"\r\n\r\nSegador savagely bit the end off a cigar. \"His faith in scoundrels!\" he\r\nsaid, vehemently. \"Enough, Mateo. Shut up before I--I ...\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHall rode into town, had dinner sent up to his room. For an hour or so,\r\nhe read the local papers. Then he turned out the lights, took off his\r\ntunic, opened his shirt collar, and put the Sam Browne belt with the\r\nhidden pockets on the bed beside him. It was to be a night of rest\r\nwithout sleep, a night of relaxing on the unmade bed with a hand never\r\nfarther than six inches from one of his two guns. Twice during the long\r\nnight he took benzedrine pills to keep awake. There could be no sleep\r\nuntil the plane was well under way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two-motored Douglas was warming her engines when the Cuban\r\ndiplomatic car delivered Hall to the airport. \"Drive right over to that\r\nbomber,\" he ordered. \"Fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" he shouted before the car could skid to a stop, \"taking off\r\nwithout me?\"\r\n\r\nSegador, freshly shaven, stepped to the doorway of the plane. \"No. Get\r\non board. We were waiting. Toss me your grip.\"\r\n\r\nHall tipped the driver of the car with a five-dollar note. \"Give me a\r\nhand, Diego. I'm not an antelope.\" Segador and the young sergeant pulled\r\nhim into the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Meet my crew. Major Blanco--First Pilot Captain Millares, Co-Pilot\r\nNavigator Lieutenant Cuesta, Sergeant Mechanic Ruiz. They are a picked\r\ncrew, and they know what is at stake in this flight.\"\r\n\r\nThe flying officers were at the controls. They saluted Hall, bade him\r\nwelcome. \"Snub Nose says we can take off,\" the captain told Segador.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's take off. Snub Nose, give Blanco a hand with his safety\r\nbelt. His hands are stiff.\"\r\n\r\nThe wiry little sergeant fastened Hall's belt. \"A lot of good it will do\r\nyou if we ground-loop, Major,\" he grinned.\r\n\r\nThis one was a Spaniard. Hall knew it at once. Young, no more than\r\ntwenty-five, but very dry behind the ears. \"_Chico_,\" he said, \"if we\r\ncrash and I get hurt I'll murder you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You terrify me.\" Snub Nose was laughing with the animal glee of sheer\r\nhappiness in being alive. \"But I like you. I brought a bucket along just\r\nfor you when you get air-sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough out of you, General Cisneros!\" the first pilot yelled\r\ninto the microphone in his fist. \"Come on up to the office and stop\r\nbothering your betters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me when you feel sick,\" the boy roared at Hall, his strong-timbred\r\nvoice rising above the blasts of the engines. He went up forward, stood\r\nbehind the pilots as the big plane taxied into position and took off.\r\n\r\n\"I examined the negatives last night,\" Segador said. \"They are worth all\r\nthey have cost. Were they very hard to get, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two lives. But one was a doomed life. It was not hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feel like sleeping?\" Segador pointed to an inflated rubber pallet in\r\nthe bomb bay.\r\n\r\n\"I could use a few hours of sleep,\" Hall admitted. He made his way to\r\nthe pallet, covered himself with an army greatcoat.\r\n\r\nHe slept heavily, waking only to eat, to stretch his legs once when they\r\nlanded to refuel and show their papers to a new set of officials, and,\r\nfinally, when Segador shook him and told him to put on his parachute.\r\n\r\n\"We're near the border,\" Segador said. He had a map and a heavy black\r\npencil in his left hand. \"Can you put it on?\"\r\n\r\nHall had worn similar chutes while flying with the R.A.F. over France.\r\nHe waved Snub Nose away with a derisive gesture. \"Back to your nursery,\r\n_chico_,\" he said to the sergeant. \"I was wearing chutes when you were\r\nin diapers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Snub Nose said, deliberately misunderstanding, \"we can't\r\ngive you a diaper, senor. Just make believe you're wearing a diaper if\r\nyou have to jump.\"\r\n\r\nHall looked out of the window. The late afternoon sun was beginning to\r\nwane.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" Segador said, making a mark on the map. \"We are here now. I'd\r\nplanned on crossing our own borders just after dark. But we had a strong\r\ntail wind all the way. We're ahead of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not so good, Mateo. Most of the army is loyal, but for the last\r\ntwo months Gamburdo has been bringing the Germans back into the army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Germans?\"\r\n\r\n\"We call them the Germans. I mean the sons of the _estancieros_ and the\r\n_senoritos_ who became officers under Segura while he had his Reichswehr\r\nexperts running the army. Tabio kicked them out, but he neglected to\r\nshoot them. The bastards are everywhere now. We have to assume that they\r\nknow I left the country in a Douglas bomber. You might have been\r\nrecognized in Havana or in Caracas by Falangist agents. The Germans are\r\nalso able to put two and two together.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was very careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it cost two lives.\" Segador flipped a switch on the panel in front\r\nof his seat. \"Attention, everyone,\" he said into his microphone.\r\n\"Lieutenant, how soon before we reach the national border?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we maintain our air speed, Major, we are due to cross the border in\r\nless than forty minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Come back here, please.\" Then, while the co-pilot left his seat\r\nup front and started back to the seats near the bomb bay, Segador\r\ncontinued talking. \"Captain, you know what we must expect. The fliers\r\nare all loyal; I don't think they would shoot down one of our own planes\r\nwithout permission of their chief. But there are too many Germans in the\r\nA-A arm. We may have trouble from the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can fly higher, sir. We are now at seven thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take her up to nine.\" He turned to the navigator. \"How much will that\r\nput between our belly and the mountain tops at the border?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand, Major.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can climb higher and fly on oxygen,\" the captain suggested.\r\n\r\n\"No. We've got to take this chance,\" Segador said. There was not enough\r\noxygen on board, and only the major knew that this was because the chief\r\nof the air arm feared the new officers who handled the oxygen depot.\r\n\r\n\"Navigator, take a look at my map.\" The pencil traced a straight line\r\nextending two hundred miles across the border. \"Is this our course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Major. We are flying on course now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\" Segador looked at his watch, extended the pencil line another\r\nhundred miles into the country. \"Snub Nose--how much flying time is left\r\nin our fuel tanks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of the pencil came to rest at the end of the line Segador had\r\ndrawn on the map. \"Can we make this point on our gas and still have\r\nenough left to fly back to San Martin Airport _from the north_? It would\r\nmean flying a wide circle.\"\r\n\r\nThe navigator studied the map. \"It can be done, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Mateo, my plan is to drop by parachute with the negatives at this\r\npoint. The plane is then to return and land at San Martin. You will then\r\nmake your way to San Hermano by train and go directly to Gonzales by\r\ncar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will I be followed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a man at San Martin. He will guide you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"With luck, I'll be in San Hermano before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nine thousand,\" the captain said. \"Border ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pour on the coals. Take your stations, men.\" Segador patted Snub Nose\r\non the back as the youngster crawled into the glass bubble below the\r\npilot's feet. The navigator went to the guns in the rear. \"Stay here,\r\nMateo,\" Segador ordered. He climbed into the mid-ship gun turret.\r\n\r\nHall had once been accustomed to being human super-cargo on board a\r\nfighting plane. This time the feeling irritated him. For want of\r\nsomething better to do, he took down a tommy gun from a rack near\r\nSegador's seat and examined it for dust and grease. It was immaculately\r\nkept. He laid it across his lap.\r\n\r\n\"Crossing the border now,\" the pilot announced.\r\n\r\nThe plane shot across the heavily wooded mountains, left them well\r\nbehind in fifteen minutes. Hall followed the fading shadows of the plane\r\nas it sped over the foothills. In a few minutes, darkness would blot out\r\nthe shadows, and then he would again know the strangely exhilarating\r\nfeeling of being alone in the skies at night.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant,\" Segador said, \"go up front and check the course.\"\r\n\r\nThe major and the sergeant remained at their guns. \"More hills ahead,\"\r\nthe navigator explained to Hall as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"No lights,\" Segador ordered.\r\n\r\nHall walked forward, stood behind the men at the instruments. The\r\nnavigator was making his readings under a shielded blue light. Millares,\r\nthe pilot, pulled back on his stick, slightly, begging altitude at a\r\nminimum loss of air speed as he climbed to put more distance between the\r\nplane and the string of lower hills which lay across their course.\r\n\r\nThe navigator suddenly became very busy at his radio. \"Major,\" he said\r\ninto his microphone, \"we are being called by a ground station. They've\r\nspotted us. They want to know who is in command, and what flight this\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stick to your course,\" Segador answered. \"Maximum speed.\" He crawled\r\nback to the main cabin.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I answer, Major?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't answer them. We'll just act as if we didn't pick up their\r\nsignal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Major. They're repeating their request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mateo,\" Segador said, \"this is very bad. I don't know who controls the\r\nground station. We can't take chances. I'm jumping as soon as it gets\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a matter of minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Navigator, the plan remains the same, except that I jump in ten\r\nminutes. Ignore all ground challenges on your way back to San Martin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm jumping with you,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"No, you're not.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they shoot us down on the way back to San Martin, the negatives will\r\nfall into their hands, if they're not destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we both jump and are both caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a chance I'd rather take, Diego.\" Hall opened the secret pocket in\r\nthe visor of his Cuban Army cap. \"Let me leave this set of negatives\r\nwith Snub Nose. I have two more sets on me--in my Sam Browne and my\r\nboots.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to think about it.\" Segador adjusted the harness of his\r\nparachute. Then he picked up his microphone. \"Snub Nose,\" he ordered,\r\n\"come back here. Adjust the _companero's_ parachute. He's jumping with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bueno._ I'll show him how to use it, too.\"\r\n\r\nHall and Segador formally shook hands with the rest of the crew before\r\nthey jumped.\r\n\r\nFor a few long seconds, plunging face downward, Hall could not think. He\r\nsaw the plane pass over his feet, silver wings etched against the dark\r\nceiling. He counted to seven, aloud, his voice lost in the wind. Then he\r\npulled the release cord. There was the expected moment of tensing pain\r\nas the silk clawed at the night air and the straps of the harness cut\r\ninto the insides of his thighs. In his mind's eye there was a picture he\r\nhad forgotten: a sand-bagged office in London on a bright May morning,\r\nthe English girl with the yellow crutch under her arm as she handed him\r\nthe mail. Tear sheets on the series he'd done in Scotland. _Copyright\r\n1940 by Ball Syndicate Inc., Somewhere in England, April 19, 1940._ This\r\nmorning I took my place in line inside of a converted Lancaster, watched\r\nthe man in front of me lean out and tumble into the clear sky, and then\r\ndid exactly as he had done. I counted to ten, pulled my release cord,\r\nand ... And what a hell of a pseudo-romantic way to make a living, he'd\r\nsaid to himself and to the English girl that morning.\r\n\r\nBut tonight there was nothing phony about sitting in a canvas sling,\r\nfalling through a wet cloud, eyes peeled for the white of Segador's\r\nparachute. Tonight he was no Sunday supplement kibitzer taking a joy\r\nride amidst men rehearsing for death. Tonight he was finally in the war,\r\nas a combatant.\r\n\r\nThe tricks he had learned in Scotland served him in good stead now. He\r\nwas able to play the cords of the parachute, guiding the direction of\r\nhis descent so that he followed Segador. There was little time to think\r\nof anything but the operation of the moment. Fortunately, it was a green\r\nnight. Like Segador, Hall could see from a thousand feet that they were\r\ndropping over a sloping meadow. At about two hundred feet, they could\r\nsee that they were going to land in the middle of a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\nThe sheep began to bleat madly and run about in circles, as first\r\nSegador, then Hall, dropped into their pasture. Segador broke free of\r\nhis silk, ran over to help the American. \"Careful,\" he said. \"With so\r\nmany sheep, there must be a herder around. Let me do the talking.\"\r\n\r\nA man in a woolly sheepskin cape was following a cautious sheep dog\r\ntoward the spot where they stood. He carried a rifle.\r\n\r\nSegador allowed the shepherd to approach to within fifty feet. \"_Hola!_\"\r\nhe called. \"We have disturbed your flock.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd said something to his dog, continued advancing slowly\r\ntoward the two men from the sky.\r\n\r\n\"He is afraid we might be Germans,\" Segador said. \"They hate the Germans\r\nworse than the devil in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" The shepherd was now quite close to them. Hall could see\r\nat once that he was a Basque.\r\n\r\n\"Vasco?\" Hall asked. He poured out a stream of Basque greetings. They\r\nserved only to put the shepherd more on his guard.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you fall from the skies--like _quintacolumnistas_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, _companero_,\" Segador said. \"But we are not fifth\r\ncolumnists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you of the Republic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other. He is not of the Republic. His uniform is different, and he\r\nspeaks the tongue of my fathers badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is of the Republic of Cuba. He is a friend of our Republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"You both have guns,\" the herder said. He looked at his dog, who stood\r\nbetween him and the intruders. \"If you are friends, you will give your\r\nguns to the dog. I am without letters, but if you are friends, you can\r\nprove it to an educated man in our village.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your village?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are yours, _companero_. See, I take mine. I lay it on the ground\r\nfor your dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd addressed his dog in Euzkadi. The dog walked over to the\r\ngun, picked it up in his mouth, dropped it at the peasant's feet. He\r\nthen made a trip for Hall's gun.\r\n\r\n\"You will walk in front of me,\" the shepherd said. \"We will go toward\r\nthat stile.\" He picked up the two pistols, shoved them into his skin\r\nbag.\r\n\r\nSegador started to laugh. \"I salute your vigilance, shepherd. We had two\r\nguns to your one. We could have shot you first. A coward would have run\r\nfor help, first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cowards do not serve the Republic,\" the shepherd said. He remained ten\r\nfeet behind them, ignoring Segador's further attempts at conversation,\r\nmarching them toward a thatched hut on the outskirts of a tiny village.\r\nWhen they approached the hut, the dog ran ahead, started to scratch on\r\nthe unpainted door.\r\n\r\nAn Indian woman with a mestizo baby in her arms stood in the doorway\r\nwhen the three men reached the hut. \"Let them in, woman,\" the shepherd\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the small hut was dark and bare. On a pallet in the far\r\ncorner, Hall could see the forms of children huddled in sleep, how many\r\nhe could not tell. There was a stone stove, a hand-hewn table and two\r\nbenches. In another corner, a fragment of a tallow candle burned\r\nfitfully under a dim portrait. Hall realized, with an inward start, that\r\nthe portrait was not of Jesus but of Anibal Tabio.\r\n\r\n\"Hold the gun.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman put the baby on the pallet with the other children, took the\r\nrifle in her hands.\r\n\r\n\"If you are of the Republic,\" the shepherd said, \"you will allow me to\r\ntie your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are of the Republic--and for the Educator, who is now dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman, who held the gun, backed away, closer to the picture, while\r\nher husband bound the hands of Segador and Hall behind their backs, and\r\nthen connected all four hands with a third length of rope.\r\n\r\n\"Send your woman for the educated man,\" Segador said. \"But hurry. We are\r\non a mission for the Republic. We must not be delayed too long.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd took the gun from his wife. \"Go then,\" he said to her.\r\n\"Bring Bustamente the Notary to this house.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the children on the pallet were now sitting up, staring at the\r\nvisitors with wide, frightened eyes. Segador grinned at them. His eyes\r\nwere growing accustomed to the darkness. \"Go back to sleep, _ninos_,\" he\r\nwhispered. \"We will play with you when you awake.\"\r\n\r\nThe kids ducked under the woolly coverlet, hiding their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" the shepherd said. \"If you are friends, I will offer you the\r\nhospitality of this table.\" He started to roll a cigarette out of a\r\nfragment of newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"There are cigarettes in my pocket,\" Hall suggested. \"Cuban cigarettes.\r\nPerhaps you would like one.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd rose from his own bench without a word, found the\r\ncigarettes, put two in the mouths of Hall and Segador. He struck a rope\r\nlighter, started their cigarettes. Then, still without speaking, he\r\nfinished rolling his own cigarette and lit it. \"If you are fifth\r\ncolumnists,\" he said, \"I spit on your cigarettes.\" There was no rancor\r\nin his statement; it was a polite expression of simple logic.\r\n\r\nHis wife returned in a few minutes. She was with a nervous little\r\nwhite-haired man who clung to the waistband of his alpaca trousers. He\r\ncarried a shiny alpaca jacket in his free arm--this and the steel-framed\r\nglasses on his ancient nose were his badges of authority.\r\n\r\n\"This is Bustamente the Notary,\" the shepherd said.\r\n\r\nBustamente fingered his glasses. \"Yes,\" he said, alive to the importance\r\nof the moment. \"I am the Notary.\" He squinted down his nose at the two\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"Major Diego Segador, of the Republic. And this is my colleague, Major\r\nAngel Blanco, of the Cuban Army.\"\r\n\r\n\"They fell from the sky,\" the shepherd said. \"Like fifth columnists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true, Your Eminences?\" Bustamente the Notary was taking no\r\nchances.\r\n\r\n\"It is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have papers. Mine are in here. And yours, Major Blanco?\"\r\n\r\nThe Notary adjusted his glasses, turned to the papers while the\r\nshepherd's wife held a candle over them. \"Ay,\" he said. \"They look real.\r\nYes, I must admit they look real. On the other hand, I must also admit\r\nthat I have never seen real Cuban papers.\" This was indeed a problem for\r\nthe Notary. He scratched his chin, importantly, cleared his throat with\r\na rumbling hawk. \"What do you think, Juan Antonio?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am without letters,\" the shepherd said.\r\n\r\n\"I must admit,\" the Notary said, not without sadness, \"I must admit that\r\nI have never seen real papers of our own army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" Segador said, \"it is important that we get to San Hermano. Is\r\nthere anyone in this village who is not for the landowners or the mine\r\nowners or the Germans who has seen real papers? I ask this in the name\r\nof Don Anibal Tabio, in whose name we undertook our mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice will be done,\" said Bustamente the Notary. \"This is the era of\r\njustice, my good friends.\" He tried to punctuate his pronouncement with\r\nTabio's famous gesture. To do this he had to release his waistband, and\r\nhis trousers started to fall to his knees. From the pallet came a\r\nchoking snicker.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" Juan Antonio hissed to the kids on the dark pallet. \"Show\r\nrespect for Bustamente the Notary.\" His wife, at the same time, restored\r\nthe Notary's dignity by handing him a length of cord to use as a belt.\r\nHe fixed his trousers and then made the moment truly solemn by putting\r\non his jacket.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the Notary will dispense the justice of the Republic,\" the\r\nshepherd said.\r\n\r\n\"_Hombre!_ This is very serious,\" Bustamente the Notary whispered. It\r\nwas a loud stage whisper. \"We must consider our decision with careful\r\nseriousness, Juan Antonio.\" He stepped outside of the hut.\r\n\r\nHall could hear his discussion with the shepherd. \"The one who claims to\r\nbe of us,\" the Notary said, \"he does not talk like an enemy of Don\r\nAnibal, Mayhissoulrestinpeace. How does the other talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. He tried to speak in Euzkadi. It is not his tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, in a sense, suspicious then. But we must not be hasty. Justice\r\nbegins in the village.\" The phrase was Tabio's.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do, Senor Notary?\"\r\n\r\n\"The laws of the Constitution of the Republic guarantee justice to all\r\nsuspects, Juan Antonio. Please tell me all you know about the two\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened to the simple recital of the facts. \"Ay, it is as I have\r\nobserved, _amigo_. There is much to be said on both sides. If they were\r\nGermans or fifth columnists, perhaps they would have shot you first. On\r\nthe other hand, since neither of us has ever seen a Cuban uniform, how\r\ncan we tell? And if they are ours, why did they drop from the sky into\r\nthe middle of a flock of sheep?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very deep, Senor Notary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us talk softer, Juan Antonio. Perhaps they can hear us inside.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved farther from the doorway, conversed in whispers for a few\r\nminutes, and then they started to walk down the dirt street of the\r\nvillage. Hall and Segador sat patiently, without exchanging a word.\r\nOnce, while they waited for the shepherd and the Notary, Segador told\r\nHall with a look that he thought everything was going to be all right.\r\nThen the two villagers returned with two horses and two donkeys.\r\n\r\n\"We have decided,\" said Bustamente the Notary, \"that in the interests of\r\nfull justice we must take you to see the school teacher in Puente Bajo.\r\nHe will know what to do.\"\r\n\r\nSegador sighed with relief. \"Thank you, Senor Notary,\" he said. \"And\r\nthank you, _Companero_ Shepherd. I am certain that your decision is the\r\nwisest one could make, and that we shall receive ample justice from the\r\nschool teacher of Puente Bajo. But tell me, how far is the village from\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is less than five miles, Major.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am content.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd undid the cord that connected the bound hands of Hall and\r\nSegador and, because their hands were still tied behind their backs, he\r\nhelped them mount the donkeys. He and the Notary climbed into the wooden\r\nsaddles of their small horses, fastening the donkeys' leads to their\r\npommels.\r\n\r\nSegador smiled at Hall, whose donkey was being led by the shepherd.\r\n\"Wonderful,\" he said. \"Sancho leads the noble Don home from an encounter\r\nwith the sheep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, gentlemen,\" Bustamente the Notary said, sharply, \"you are not\r\nto address one another. Justice begins in the village, and\r\njustice\"--again he aped Don Anibal's gesture--\"and justice will be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We bow to your authority in matters of justice,\" Segador said, gravely.\r\n\r\nHe and Hall sat in silence as the convoy cut across a meadow on the\r\nslope and turned toward the outlines of a larger village in the valley.\r\nThey jogged toward the dim yellow lights of Puente Bajo, the shepherd\r\npiercing the night quiet with the curses he flung at the heads of the\r\ndonkeys every time they balked.\r\n\r\nAt the outskirts of the town, Bustamente the Notary ordered a halt. \"I\r\nhave been thinking,\" he said. \"It is my feeling that if the two on the\r\ndonkeys are of the Republic and innocent, then we will have committed an\r\noffense against their sacred dignity if we lead them into Puente Bajo\r\nfettered on mangy donkeys. I have therefore come to the conclusion that\r\nperhaps it would be better for me to ride on alone to the school and\r\nbring the teacher back to meet us here, by the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can agree,\" the shepherd said. \"But wait until I tether their\r\ndonkeys.\" He dismounted, led the donkeys to the side of the road and\r\ntied their forefeet to lengths of rope he fastened to a strong tree.\r\n\r\n\"Would you want one of your own cigarettes?\" he asked Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Many thanks. And one for Major Segador, too. And please take one\r\nfor yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd declined with a serious face. \"First,\" he said, \"I must\r\nhear what the school teacher has to say about you. He is wiser, even,\r\nthan Bustamente the Notary.\"\r\n\r\nBustamente the Notary and the man who was acknowledged to be even of\r\nmore wisdom than he returned out of breath; the school teacher from\r\ntrotting after the short horse and the Notary from talking incessantly\r\nto the pedagogue. The teacher was a compact mestizo in his early\r\ntwenties, a short youth with a furrowed sloping Indian forehead and\r\nbright beady black eyes. He was wearing a pair of brown-cotton trousers,\r\na blue shirt without a tie, and rope-soled slippers.\r\n\r\n\"Are you truly Major Segador?\" he asked. And then, without waiting for\r\nthe answer, he turned to the shepherd and began to berate him. \"You\r\nfool,\" he shouted, \"untie his bonds at once. Do you know that he sat in\r\nEl Moro with Don Anibal?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am without learning,\" the shepherd said.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right, teacher,\" Segador said. \"The _companero_ did his\r\nduty--and he did it properly. Undo my hand, Juan Antonio, so that I may\r\nshake your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, _companero_,\" the school teacher said to the shepherd. \"I\r\nspoke to you without thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, teacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am called Pablo Artigas.\" He helped Hall and Segador get off the\r\ndonkeys. \"I regret that you have had so much grief in our province.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a member of the Union?\" Segador asked.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. For three years--since I am a teacher. Before that I\r\nbelonged to the Union of Students.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have your _carnet_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with me, Major Segador. It is in my room at the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will look at it. May we go with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be honored.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Your Honors,\" said Bustamente the Notary, \"I insist that you\r\nride the horses. The teacher may have one of the donkeys. I shall walk.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd reached into his sheepskin cloak. \"Here are your pistols,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nHall passed his cigarettes around. The shepherd accepted one with a shy\r\nsmile. \"I am glad that you are not angry, Senor Cuban Major,\" he said.\r\n\"I have never had a Cuban cigarette before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter eighteen_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fantastic! Sheer fantasy on paper, but it's all true. All roads lead to\r\nSan Hermano. First, Lobo. Then, today, the man from Spain. Then ...\"\r\nFelipe Duarte could not sit still. He walked around Hall's room at the\r\nBolivar like a referee during a fast bout between flyweights.\r\n\"Ostensibly, Lobo came to represent Batista at the funeral yesterday.\r\nActually, he came to bring duplicates and even the originals of most of\r\nyour negatives--as well as a report on Androtten. I don't know what's in\r\nthe Androtten report yet; all I know is that the American Intelligence\r\nService had something on it, and they gave it to Lobo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to reach him on the phone.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's busy, Mateo. He's closeted with Lavandero. That's not all ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, the de Sola affidavit. I'll have to tell you about Havana,\r\nFelipe. And about the all-night march to Cerrorico through the woods\r\nwith Segador and the school teacher and the Notary's mules.\" _Mateo, eh\r\nMateo, what did you see in the shepherd's hut? Tabio's picture? All I\r\ncould see was poverty, Mateo._\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you're not listening? What are you thinking of?\"\r\n\r\nHall put his shaving brush down, inserted a fresh blade in his razor. \"A\r\nthousand things. Cerrorico. The mining stronghold. Segador said the\r\ncommunists had a good press and that they were reliable. He wasn't\r\nkidding. They must have run off a million leaflets with reproductions of\r\nthe Ansaldo pictures and the Havana documents by the time I left.\"\r\nLater, he would tell Duarte about the ride from Cerrorico in the engine\r\ncab of an ore train, and hopping off at dawn at the Monte Azul station,\r\nand being met by a Pepe Delgado who wore a freshly washed and\r\nill-fitting reservist's uniform and drove a small army lorry. Segador\r\nhad gone ahead on an earlier train.\r\n\r\n\"You should have seen the leaflets yesterday, Mateo. Just as the funeral\r\nprocession was at its greatest the army planes appeared overhead and\r\nstarted to drop the leaflets by the ton. And an hour after the leaflets\r\nfell from the skies, the pro-United Nations papers were all over the\r\ncountry with front-page reproductions of the pictures and the\r\ndocuments.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all that time I was sleeping on an ore train. Who is this man from\r\nSpain you mentioned, Felipe?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fantastic! After Mogrado got my message, he rounded up two\r\nSpanish Army surgeons who knew Ansaldo. They made affidavits, too. That\r\nisn't the half of what Mogrado did. He reached the Spanish underground\r\nin Spain via a cable to Lisbon. And this morning the Clipper came in\r\nfrom Lisbon, and what do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't think. But don't tell me it's fantastic, Felipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is fantastic. There is a man on board the plane, a typical\r\n_senorito_. He has papers with him that say he is a Spanish diplomat.\r\nThe minute he steps ashore, a mug from the Spanish Embassy recognizes\r\nhim. 'He is a fraud, a _rojo_, a defiler of nuns and an arsonist of\r\ncathedrals!' he shrieks. It's fantastic! The man with the papers lifts a\r\nheavy fist and he lets fly with a blow that knocks out the fascist's\r\nfront teeth. 'Baby killer!' he hollers, and then he turns around to the\r\nairport officials and he says he is a Mexican citizen who used fake\r\npapers to escape from Spain and he demands that they take him under\r\nguard to the Mexican Embassy. In the meanwhile he says they'll have to\r\nkill him if they want to take his papers before he is delivered in\r\nperson to the Mexican Embassy. Is it fantastic, Mateo?\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake stop telling me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is fantastic! He makes them drive him to the Mexican Embassy,\r\nand the Spanish official is screaming like a stuck pig that the man is a\r\nSpanish citizen and an agent of the Comintern.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a Spaniard, of course. The underground sent him. They had cadres\r\nin the office of the Falange National Delegation. They took out the\r\nFalange party records of Ansaldo and Marina, put them under a camera,\r\nand sent the pictures to San Hermano with this agent. It was a farce. I\r\nwas in the next room, listening to him as he told the Ambassador that\r\nhis name was Joaquin Bolivar. Then I walked in, the sweet light of\r\nrecognition on my ugly face, shouting 'Joaquin! My old University pal,\r\nJoaquin! Don't you recognize your old Felipe Duarte?' The Ambassador\r\njust watches me. The man's papers are still in a sealed envelope before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough for him. He slams his hands down on the papers and says he\r\nclaims them in the name of his government. 'I will take the\r\nresponsibility for Senor Bolivar,' he says. 'I have reason to believe he\r\nis a Mexican national.' I ask you, Mateo--is it fantastic?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It's just efficient. Where is he now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Ambassador took him and his papers to see Lavandero. He's giving a\r\ndeposition and an interview to the press.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to take in the interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Stay away. Segador thinks it will be wiser if you stay away. But\r\nthat isn't all. Do you remember the picture of Ansaldo that started you\r\noff on your wild-goose chase?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaguely. What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a doctor in the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Puerto Rico.\r\nHe is the head of the pro-Loyalist Spanish society on the island ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ramon Toro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Toro. You know him? Well, he must be a man worth knowing. He has a\r\ncollection of _Avance_--that was the Falange organ in San Juan, starting\r\nwith issue number one. When he sees the picture of Gamburdo embracing\r\nAnsaldo--it was on the front page of _El Mundo_ in San Juan--a bell\r\nrings in his head. He starts going through his _Avances_, and what do\r\nyou think? He finds the picture you were looking for in an August issue.\r\nSo he rips open his suitcase, pastes the whole issue of _Avance_ between\r\nthe linings, and arrives at the San Hermano airport last night. He\r\ndoesn't stop. He takes his bag straight to the editor of _La\r\nDemocracia_, empties it of his clothes, and pulls out the ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ! Toro had it all the time!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's on the front page of _La Democracia_ this morning. I was in such a\r\nrush to get here that I left it in my office. I tell you, all roads lead\r\nto San Hermano. Every time I hear a plane overhead, I think, aha! more\r\nanonymous Republicans and underground agents and Cuban generals are\r\ncoming in with more documents. It's fantastic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did anyone else turn up?\" Hall was feeling better than he had in years.\r\nHe was one of many now, he knew, one of an army who marched in uniform,\r\nout of uniform, but an army which knew the enemy and knew how to fight\r\nhim. Mogrado, Fielding, Duarte, Segador, Rafael, Pepe, Vicente,\r\nIglesias, even poor Rivas for all his cringing and breast-beating--the\r\narmy was strong, and it was growing stronger with the taste of victory.\r\nThat was all that mattered, now.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's the beginning of the end for the Falange,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The hell it is, Mateo.\" Duarte was coming down to earth. \"It will be a\r\nlong row to hoe. Your State Department has been distributing judicious\r\nhints that a unilateral policy toward Franco will upset the apple cart.\r\nThey're after an all-Hemisphere policy toward Spain. All that this means\r\nis that none of the countries, except my own, will dare to break with\r\nFranco until Washington takes the lead. Not even this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a diplomat, Mateo. Mark my words.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have to eat those words by the end of the week.\" Hall doused\r\nhis face with bay rum, patted it with a towel. \"When did they call the\r\ntroops up? Pepe started to tell me about it when he drove me over last\r\nnight, but I fell asleep as soon as he got started.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three days ago, Mateo. There was a meeting of the Student Council to\r\nAid the United Nations at the University. The hall was packed. Then the\r\nCross and Sword gunmen stormed the entrances and fired point blank into\r\nthe crowd. There were over fifteen deaths, and so many injured that the\r\nUniversity authorities established an emergency hospital in five lecture\r\nrooms. Your Jerry has been there since. The commanding general of this\r\narea is loyal to the Republic; he called up the reserves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Jerry? I've been trying to reach her all morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is wonderful. All the patients are trying to teach her Spanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we waiting for? Let's go to the University.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me. I've got to go back to the Embassy. Lobo says he can meet us\r\nboth for lunch at the Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make it. Let's go. Oh, one more thing. I put through some calls to\r\nNew York. And some are coming in. I gave your office as one of the\r\nplaces I could be reached.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be late.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJerry could spend only a few minutes with Hall on the University steps.\r\n\"Gonzales told me that you were safe,\" she said. \"And also what you\r\naccomplished. I'm proud of you, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I worried about you,\" he said. \"Were you scared when you found yourself\r\nin a war zone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Just angry. Maria Luisa was at the meeting when the shooting\r\nstarted. She wasn't hurt, thank God, but she was a bloody mess when she\r\ngot home. Gonzales and I left for the University at once. I've been\r\nhere, since. We've had four deaths to date.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can you get away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till dinner time. But things are easing up. We've been able to\r\ntransfer more than half of our cases to the hospitals.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bolivar at eight.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a cab to the Mexican Embassy. The driver was beaming as he shut\r\nthe door. He told Hall that the early returns were overwhelmingly in\r\nfavor of Lavandero. \"Yes, senor,\" he laughed, \"the fascists are on the\r\nrun today. The lines formed outside of the polling places three and even\r\nfour hours before they opened. Did you see what fell from the planes\r\nyesterday? Did you see the papers? Those dirty fascists!\"\r\n\r\nDuarte had figures to back up the cab driver's story when Hall reached\r\nthe Mexican Embassy. \"It is a wonderful victory, Mateo,\" he said. \"The\r\ntide is running so strongly that Gamburdo is expected to concede the\r\nelection before the polls close at five.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bastard! Where's Lobo?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be here in a minute. Let me show you some of the leaflets. I'll\r\nbet you haven't seen one yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaflet was the size of a standard newspaper page, printed on both\r\nsides. There was the large picture of Gamburdo embracing Ansaldo smack\r\nup against the shot of Ansaldo, in fascist uniform, giving the fascist\r\nsalute along with the Nazi and the Italian officers. Most of the Falange\r\ndocuments proving the Axis ties of Gamburdo and the Cross and Sword were\r\nalso reproduced on the single sheet.\r\n\r\n\"It turned the election,\" Duarte said. \"Until yesterday, the fascists\r\nwere spreading the story that Lavandero had kept Ansaldo from operating\r\nin time. Gamburdo was so anxious to grab the credit for Ansaldo that he\r\ndug his own grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not in the grave, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be patient.\"\r\n\r\nLobo walked into the office. He was wearing his regulation tan uniform.\r\n\"Mateo,\" he shouted, \"you're a fraud! I heard you were wearing a Cuban\r\nofficer's uniform.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's in shreds, Jaime.\"\r\n\r\nLobo eased his long frame into Duarte's favorite chair. \"I thought you'd\r\nnever gotten through,\" he said. \"After the second day of silence I was\r\nsure the fascists had clipped your wings. Don't bother to tell me about\r\nyour hardships, though. I've already seen Segador.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone has seen Segador,\" Hall laughed. \"Everyone but me. When the\r\nhell do I see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's very busy, my friend. He's responsible to a government, you know,\r\nnot to himself, like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mierda!_\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me. There's an American officer in town. From Miami.\"\r\n\r\n\"Intelligence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. He's a very nice guy, Mateo. The American Ambassador's\r\ndaughter here told him that you are an agent of the Comintern. He told\r\nme that he knew she was crazy. He asked me to tell you that he's a\r\nstraight-shooter and he wants to speak to you. In a friendly way, of\r\ncourse. Name's Barrows. A lieutenant-colonel. Know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What about Androtten?\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Barrows, first? If I were you, I'd give him a ring. He's at\r\nthe American Embassy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Shall I ask him to lunch with us?\"\r\n\r\nBarrows was not free for lunch. He arranged to meet Hall at Duarte's\r\noffice at three. \"He sounds human,\" Hall admitted.\r\n\r\nDuring their luncheon, Lobo told Hall and Duarte what he had learned\r\nabout Androtten from the American Government. The man was a German named\r\nSchmidt or Wincklemann (he had used passports in both names) who had a\r\nrecord as a German agent which went back to 1915. He had spent some time\r\nin Java, some years in Spanish Morocco, and the year of 1935 living in a\r\nvilla at Estoril, the beach resort outside of Lisbon. \"The record\r\ndoesn't say what he was doing in Portugal,\" Lobo said. \"My guess is that\r\nhe was working with Sanjurjo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd back you on that,\" Hall said. \"The old rumhound needed someone to\r\nhold his hand before the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are blank spaces in the record after that,\" Lobo said. \"The next\r\nentry is the spring of 1938, when your Androtten was known as\r\nWincklemann. He turned up in Rome as an art dealer specializing in\r\nSpanish masterpieces. He sold two Goyas and a Velasquez to three rich\r\nladies in the British colony; told them the paintings were from the\r\nprivate collections of Spanish noblemen who had been ruined by the\r\n_rojos_. He was lying, of course--the paintings had all been taken from\r\nSpanish museums by the Nazis. Wincklemann disappeared, and the ladies\r\nfinally sold the paintings back to the Franco government in 1940 for the\r\nsame price. The last mention of Wincklemann or Schmidt is a paragraph\r\nfrom a letter mailed to Washington from Mexico in July, 1941. The letter\r\nwas from the junta of Dominican opposition leaders and mentioned a\r\nGunther Wincklemann as one of four Nazi agents who had been guests of\r\nTrujillo in the Dominican capital that month.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHall borrowed an empty office in the Mexican Embassy for his appointment\r\nwith the American officer. It went off well. Barrows was a\r\nplain-speaking man in his early forties, with the handshake of a young\r\nand vigorous boiler maker. He had a nice, unhurried way about him, his\r\nfrosty blue eyes surveying Hall with good humor while he fussed with his\r\nthick-walled pipe. \"I'd heard all sorts of conflicting stories about\r\nyou,\" he said, smiling at the conflicts.\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Hall said.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could tell you half of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the Ambassador's half. Heard it in Havana.\"\r\n\r\nBarrows snorted. \"Have you a match that lights?\" he asked. \"I've been\r\ntrying to get this pipe started for days.\" He refused a cigar. It was a\r\nmatch that he wanted. Hall had a lighter whose flame burned long enough\r\nto light the pipe. \"There now,\" he said, \"now we can talk. I know that\r\nyou heard about the Ambassador's report. If it will make you feel any\r\nbetter, Skidmore got his tail singed for it.\" He was highly amused.\r\n\r\n\"Good.\" Hall was warming up to Barrows. \"I hate stuffed shirts.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I. But frankly, Hall, I'd like to drop the subject. I--I need\r\nyour advice. Unofficially, of course. But I need it. It's about the\r\nreports that the late Roger Fielding made to the British Embassy. You\r\nsaw them, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only once. A few nights before he was killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I was told. Commander New in the British Embassy told me.\r\nHe's not exactly up on the San Hermano scene yet, you know. He thinks\r\nthat after the job you and Lobo did in Havana that he ought to turn the\r\noriginals of the Fielding reports over to the government. What he\r\ndoesn't know is who to hand them to. He wants to know who will use them\r\nand who will burn them. He thought that since you were an American, he'd\r\nask me to get your slant on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it,\" Hall said. \"You want one guy who is certain to be an\r\nanti-fascist. Someone who will know just how to use the information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I don't suppose I have to tell you, Hall, that the enemy has\r\nbeen sinking our shipping in the South Atlantic and the Caribbean at a\r\nrate that spells one hell of a long war. I know, as you do, that\r\nFalangist Spaniards on shore are working with the Nazi undersea raiders.\r\nBut even if we wanted to, we couldn't send enough Marines to South\r\nAmerica to root 'em out. We've got to rely on the local governments to\r\ndo the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\" Hall was bitter. \"We want this Republic to root out the\r\nFalangists, so we send an Ambassador who plays footy with the Falangists\r\nin public and calls the anti-Falangist President a dirty Red.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're carping, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'm carping. I'm a taxpayer, it's my prerogative to carp. We\r\nwant the Latin American Republics to get tough with the Franquists who\r\nare helping the Nazis sink our ships, so we sell the Spanish fascists\r\nthe oil they transfer to the Nazi subs, and we send an Ambassador to\r\nMadrid whose only exercise is kissing Franco's foot in public every\r\nSunday morning, and when any of our sister Republics want to break with\r\nFranco we dispatch a sanctimonious buzzard in striped pants from the\r\nState Department and he tells them to lay off Franco, Spain's Saviour\r\nfrom Atheism and Communism. How in the hell can we expect the Latin\r\nRepublics to crack down on Franco's stooges at home when we ourselves\r\nplay up to Franco in Madrid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have that lighter again.\" Barrows was cool and unruffled, the\r\nsmile that danced across the smooth lines of his face never wavered.\r\n\"I'm a soldier,\" he said, pleasantly. \"I can't discuss policy. I can\r\nonly talk tactics. You know that, Hall. Tactics is the art of working\r\nwith an existent situation and licking it--not waiting for the\r\nmillennium. You think our policy toward Franco Spain should be changed.\r\nMaybe you're right. Maybe it will be changed. But, in the meanwhile,\r\nFranquists in Latin America, in this country specifically, are putting\r\nthe finger on our ships. Fielding's reports might be accurate. If we are\r\nto act on them, we need the help of pro-Allied members of this\r\ngovernment. Who is our man?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one man in these parts who can be trusted completely to do the\r\nright things with those reports,\" Hall answered. \"Give him the reports,\r\nand after the polls close he'll be in a position to round up every\r\nfascist Fielding listed and put them on ice for the duration. He's an\r\narmy man--Major Diego Segador.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think he's our man, eh? Would you mind writing his name in my\r\nbook, and the best place to reach him?\"\r\n\r\nHall carefully printed the information Barrows wanted and then, as he\r\nreturned the book, he said, deliberately, \"But there's one thing you\r\nshould know about Segador. He's everything I said he is, and more. But\r\nhe's also a leftist. He's very close to the Communist Party.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" Barrows said, casually. \"The Russians are killing plenty of\r\nGermans, and I understand their chief is a member of the party, too. Man\r\nnamed Stalin, or something like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind if I call you unique?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. But let me ask one. What are you planning to do for the\r\nduration? Ever think of G-2?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. I applied before Pearl Harbor. They turned me down so hard I\r\nthought I was hit by a truck. I applied again on December 8th, 1941. It\r\nwas still no soap. I was for the Loyalists in Spain, you know. That made\r\nme what the brass hats term a 'premature anti-fascist' and definitely\r\nnot officer material.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know about that,\" Barrows said. \"What would you do if the door\r\nwas opened for you now? Understand, I'm not making an offer. I'm just\r\nasking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Hall said. \"I don't think the door would be opened. If\r\nit was--I'd have to think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I have your lighter again?\"\r\n\r\nHall watched Barrows make a major operation of relighting his pipe, and\r\nrecognized it as the officer's neat device for creating a break in a\r\nconversation that needed breaking. Barrows had a way of making the\r\nritual of lighting his pipe serve as the curtain that falls on a given\r\nscene of a play.\r\n\r\n\"The Ambassador,\" Barrows smiled. \"He's been tearing his nice white hair\r\nsince you got back from Havana. You put him on an awful spot, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll do him good, the old bastard. Do you know what Tabio told me\r\nabout him a few days before he died? He said that he was with Skidmore\r\nat a dinner a few days after Germany invaded Russia and that Skidmore\r\nsaid he was glad that now the Russians would get what was coming to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lavandero was there. He'll back me up.\" Hall stopped. \"Say, I have an\r\nidea,\" he said. \"There's one thing I can do for G-2. I can write a\r\nreport on Skidmore. I'll do it right after the elections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh-oh! It'll mean trouble with the Spats Department.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spats?\"\r\n\r\n\"State. But you make your report, and give it to me. I'll turn it in\r\nwith the rest of my stuff when I get back. Why not? You're a civilian.\r\nThe worst that can happen to you after you write the report is that\r\nyou'll have trouble getting passports and visas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't give a damn,\" Hall said. \"And I'll do something else. You gave\r\nme an idea. I'm still a civilian, you said. Swell, then I won't be\r\nclimbing over anyone's brass hat if I see to it that a copy of the\r\nreport reaches the White House.\"\r\n\r\nBarrows leaned back in his chair, laughing. \"He told me that you\r\nthreatened to do just that,\" he said. \"But he's just a harmless old\r\nduffer, Hall. He told me he wanted to shake your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can shove it. Did you meet his daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once. She doesn't like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever receive any reports in Miami about her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't answer that question, Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K. That means--oh, I guess it means that you got reports that she\r\nsleeps around plenty. But her political life is more important to G-2\r\nthan her sex didoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gossip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fact. She's secretly engaged to be married to the man who killed\r\nFielding. The Marques de Runa. But don't worry--he'll never be brought\r\nto trial for it. He's in Spain. Left by Clipper over a week ago with his\r\nchauffeur, the man who actually ran poor Fielding down.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer from Miami laid his pipe down on the desk. \"This is pretty\r\nserious,\" he said. \"I don't want to get it all by ear, old man. Would\r\nyou mind talking while it was taken down? Not only about Margaret\r\nSkidmore. About everything you can give your Uncle about the Falange?\r\nFacts, names, addresses, opinions--the works. I brought a young\r\nlieutenant with me from Miami; he was a crack stenographer in civilian\r\nlife. How about spending a few hours with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. I can give you the rest of the day, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like it fine. But if you don't mind--not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K. Dr. Gonzales' house. It's on the outskirts of the city, and we'd\r\nbe alone.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHall spent the rest of the day at Gonzales', dictating to the\r\nlieutenant. While they worked, Duarte phoned to tell him that Gamburdo\r\nhad formally conceded the election. \"What are your dinner plans?\" he\r\nasked the Mexican.\r\n\r\n\"None. I have to finish a long report on the elections before I eat.\r\nWhere and when are you eating?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I thought that for sentimental reasons I'd eat with Jerry\r\nand Pepe and Vicente and Souza at the Bolivar. Lobo is tied up for the\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll join you when I can, Mateo.\"\r\n\r\nLater, when the American officers left, Hall tried to reach his friends\r\nby phone. Arturo, the desk clerk, told him that Souza had taken the day\r\noff and that Pepe and Vicente had been called up with the reserves. He\r\ngave Hall a list of numbers where he might possibly find Pepe. Hall\r\nfinally reached him at the Transport Workers' Union. \"Can you eat with\r\nme tonight?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Where are you? Our officers just handed us our new orders. I am to\r\nbe your driver and Emilio your guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sergeants Delgado and Vicente at your orders, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this official?\"\r\n\r\nPepe laughed heartily. \"Official,\" he said. \"We can show you our\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at Gonzales'. Can you pick me up now?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeants were there in fifteen minutes. Pepe now drove an Army car\r\nwhose color matched his uniform. They drove to the University for Jerry.\r\n\r\nSoldiers were everywhere, patrolling the city, guarding both the Axis\r\ndiplomatic buildings and the commercial houses owned by known fascists.\r\nThe streets were crowded with civilians. They hung around the cafes,\r\nlistening to the latest election bulletins over the cafe radios, or they\r\ncongregated under the government's loud speakers in the plazas and the\r\nbroad avenues. Even though Gamburdo had already conceded his defeat, the\r\npeople awaited the results of each new count, cheered each new electoral\r\nrepudiation of the Falange candidate. Everywhere the sidewalks, the\r\ngutters, the doorways of stores and buildings were littered with whole\r\nor tattered copies of the leaflets exposing Gamburdo and Ansaldo.\r\n\r\n\"We gave them a licking they won't forget so quickly,\" Pepe chortled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they are still alive, Pepe. They took a licking in the last\r\nSpanish elections, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"_De nada_,\" Vicente said, grimly. \"Let them try to make a second\r\nSpanish War in our Republic. We'll drown them in their own blood.\"\r\n\r\nJerry was waiting for them on the University steps. \"Matt, it was\r\namazing. Translate for me, will you? I think Pepe and Vicente would like\r\nto know, too. As soon as the word was flashed to the wards that\r\nLavandero won the election, the serious cases started to pull through,\r\nand the others are just about ready to dance. I've never seen anything\r\nlike it!\"\r\n\r\nDuarte joined them as they were finishing their soup. He was pale and\r\nupset. \"The Axis got the news pretty quickly,\" he said. He picked up a\r\nbottle of brandy, poured a half tumbler and downed it in a gulp.\r\n\r\n\"For Christ's sake, what happened, Felipe?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Nazis,\" he said. \"This afternoon, a few minutes after Gamburdo\r\nquit, a Nazi submarine deliberately sank one of the Republic's unarmed\r\nfreighters. It happened less than thirty miles from where we're sitting.\r\nThat isn't all. The ship had time to wireless for help before she sank.\r\nAnd the Nazis waited until the rescue boats had picked up the survivors\r\nbefore they surfaced again and sank each of the boats with their deck\r\nguns.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hours ago. I kept quiet because I wanted to make sure about Souza. Now\r\nit's been confirmed. He was on one of the rescue boats. He is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the dirty ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Mateo. There is something else. Don't go. You had a call from\r\nRadio City in New York. They want you to broadcast to America at ten\r\no'clock tonight. The Siglo station has the hook-up here.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock on the Bolivar dining-room wall read eight-thirty. \"I'd better\r\ngo right over,\" Hall said. \"Eat and wait for me here, Felipe. Don't\r\nbother to drive me, Pepe. I'll walk. It's less than two blocks. Have\r\nsome more brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going with you,\" Jerry said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Come in, San Hermano ..._\" Over the long-wave from Radio City.\r\n\r\nThe station announcer gave Hall his signal. Hall mopped his face with\r\nhis sleeve, glanced at his notes. \"For a few hours this afternoon here\r\nin San Hermano,\" he said into the microphone, \"most of us believed that\r\nvirtue is its own reward, that the truth by itself is the most powerful\r\nweapon in the hands of a democracy.\r\n\r\n\"At three o'clock this afternoon, the fascist candidate for the\r\npresidency of this Republic conceded defeat in an election marked by the\r\ndramatic revelation of his ties with the Falange in Madrid and the Nazis\r\nin Berlin. There was no bloodshed, no disturbances. Democracy had scored\r\na bloodless victory in San Hermano.\r\n\r\n\"For thirty-five minutes and twelve seconds, the elections remained a\r\ntriumph for the ideals of the late president, Anibal Tabio, a man in the\r\ntraditions of our own Abraham Lincoln. It was Tabio's life-long belief\r\nthat 'Ye shall know the truth and it shall make you free.' But Tabio,\r\nlike the leaders of the last Spanish Republic, placed too much faith in\r\nthe power of good and decency and progress and had too little fear of\r\nthe fascist powers of evil abroad in this world.\r\n\r\n\"At exactly thirty-five minutes and twelve seconds after the fascist\r\nGamburdo conceded the elections to his Popular-Front opponent, the\r\npeople of this Republic learned that the world has grown much smaller\r\nsince Lincoln declared that no nation could exist half slave and half\r\nfree. Today what Lincoln had to say about one nation goes for one world.\r\nThis one world, our one world, is now torn by a global war. It is a\r\ntotal war. The people of this democracy struck at the Axis today by\r\noverwhelmingly defeating the Axis candidate at the polls. It took the\r\nAxis exactly thirty-five minutes and twelve seconds to answer the\r\ndemocratic people of this free nation. The answer was delivered by the\r\ntorpedoes and deck guns of a Nazi submarine lurking thirty miles from\r\nthe docks of this port....\"\r\n\r\nHe talked on, glancing at the station clock frequently. There was a lot\r\nhe wanted to cram into his fifteen minutes. If possible, he hoped, he\r\nwould be able to get in a few words about the big feature story on the\r\nfront page of the bulldog edition of _El Imparcial_.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and lachrymose account of how Mexico was suffering because\r\nthe food of the nation was being rushed to the American armed forces and\r\nhow the war had forced inflation and shortages on that suffering\r\nCatholic country whose people had no quarrel with Hitler and no love for\r\nthe Godless Stalin.\r\n\r\nThe red sweep-second hand raced Hall through his account of this story.\r\n\"It is no accident that this piece of Axis propaganda should be featured\r\non page one of the nation's leading pro-Franco paper tomorrow,\" he said.\r\n\"This is the Falange line for Latin America. This is the unnecessary\r\nacid the Axis is preparing to inject into the very real wounds Latin\r\nAmerica is suffering and will suffer from this total war.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcer standing at the other microphone drew his hand in front of\r\nhis own throat. Hall's time was up.\r\n\r\nJerry rushed into the studio from the anteroom, where she had been\r\nlistening to the talk over the studio radio. She kissed him, took his\r\nhand as they went downstairs and into the narrow street which led to the\r\nPlaza de la Republica. \"Where do we go from here, Matt?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"God alone knows. Let's get married tomorrow. That's one thing we'd\r\nbetter do while we still have a chance. I used to think I belonged in\r\nthe army. The army doctors rejected me for combat service; I'm too\r\nbanged up. Twice I tried to get into Intelligence, the first time before\r\nPearl Harbor. They wouldn't touch me with a fork. Saturday, Colonel\r\nBarrows hinted that they were less squeamish about accepting\r\nanti-fascists into G-2. He hinted that maybe I could get an Intelligence\r\ncommission.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go in as a nurse if they accept you, Matt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a big _if_, baby. But if they don't, we can go on fighting the\r\nfascists in our own way. We won't get Legion pins and ribbons and\r\nbonuses after it's all over, and the only uniforms we'll ever get to\r\nwear will be decoy outfits like the one I wore when I left Havana. But\r\nthe fight will be the same, and the enemy will be the same. And we won't\r\nhave to worry about getting stuck on an inactive front. We can pick our\r\nfronts.\r\n\r\n\"When it's all over, we'll go to Spain and we'll spit on Franco's grave\r\nand I'll show you where a great man named Antin died and where a kid\r\nlieutenant named Rafael killed fourteen fascists with one gun and we'll\r\nwalk down the Puerta del Sol in Madrid with the most wonderful people\r\nI've ever known--what's left of them--and we'll dandle black-eyed\r\nSpanish kids on our knees until our guts begin to ache for kids of our\r\nown and then we'll make a kid of our own and fly back so he'll be born\r\nin Ohio like his folks and grow up to be a good anti-fascist President\r\nor at least an intelligent American Ambassador to San Hermano. Ah, I'm\r\ntalking like a fool, baby, talking like a drunk in a swank bar off\r\nSutton Place.\"\r\n\r\nThe loud speakers on the lamp posts of the Plaza suddenly came alive.\r\n\r\n\"Attention, everyone! Attention!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" Matt said. \"Something's up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Attention! This is the Mayor of San Hermano speaking. Eduardo Gamburdo,\r\nwanted for the murder of Anibal Tabio, has fled the country. The Cabinet\r\nand a quorum of the legislature, meeting at six o'clock tonight, have\r\nunanimously voted that President-Elect Esteban Lavandero should be sworn\r\nin as President immediately. At ten o'clock tonight, President Lavandero\r\ntook his oath of office from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in\r\nthe Presidencia. I will repeat this announcement. Attention....\"\r\n\r\nHall translated the announcement. \"Now Lavandero has been introduced.\r\nI'll translate as he goes along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Citizens, members of the Popular Front parties, members of all\r\nparties,\" Lavandero began. \"This afternoon, at three thirty-five\r\no'clock, a submarine which has been positively identified as being of\r\nGerman nationality torpedoed a ship bearing the flag of our Republic\r\nwithin our national waters. The ship was sunk. The survivors and the men\r\non the boats which set out from shore to rescue them were shelled by\r\nthis submarine. The losses have been enormous. At the last official\r\ncount, we had lost over eighty citizens, all victims of fascist\r\nbestiality.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow, I shall go before the Congress and speak for a declaration of\r\nwar against the Axis. Tonight, my first official act has been to promote\r\nMajor Diego Segador to the rank of Colonel for outstanding services to\r\nour Republic, and to appoint him Emergency Chief of the Defense of San\r\nHermano. I have asked Colonel Segador to speak to you now.\"\r\n\r\nHall put his arm around Jerry. \"The war has come to us,\" he said. \"We\r\ndon't have to look for it any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Citizens,\" Segador said. \"Our city is in sight of a wolfpack of Nazi\r\nsubmarines of undetermined size. The lights of our city are therefore at\r\nthe service of the fascist enemy. If you are on the streets, go into\r\nyour houses, or into the nearest cafes or other buildings. If you are\r\nindoors, put out your lights, wherever you are. In five minutes, the\r\nstreet lights of the city will be turned off. This announcement is being\r\nrecorded, and will be repeated for the next thirty minutes, or as long\r\nas one light remains lit in San Hermano. Our lights are the eyes of the\r\nsubmarines--we must blind their evil eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers on duty, remain at your posts and await further orders.\r\nSoldiers off duty, report at once to your commanding officer. Sailors\r\noff shore ...\"\r\n\r\nThey stood together, watching the people hurry off the streets, watching\r\nthe lights go out in the lamp posts, in the cafes, in the houses of the\r\nold Plaza. They remained near the loud speaker, listening to the\r\nannouncement repeated, listening to the national anthem, listening,\r\nfinally, to the dark silences of the night. They remained frozen to the\r\ncobbles of the Plaza de la Republica which had been born in the days of\r\nthe empire as the Plaza de Fernando e Isabel and whose cobbles bore the\r\nshadows of the edifices of the Conquistador generations and the Segura\r\ngenerations and the democratic decade. Monuments of all manners of life\r\nrose in dark, brooding piles on all sides of the Plaza; the slave life\r\nand the life that was half slave and half free and the free life which\r\nnow had to fight for its freedom. In the dark Plaza, they could almost\r\nhear the young heart of the city, of the Republic, beating slowly,\r\nsteadily, confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"I'm not afraid of anything any more. I'll never be\r\nafraid again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he answered. \"That's what this war is about, baby. It's the\r\nwar of the people who are not afraid to live their own lives. Let's go\r\nback to the Bolivar, baby. Pepe and Vicente are still expecting us.\"\r\n\r\nPepe and Vicente were sitting in their lorry, waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\"_Companeros_,\" Pepe said, \"Duarte is waiting for you inside. You will\r\nall have to stay at the hotel tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Pepe.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to go back to our barracks,\" Vicente said. \"We are called.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _companeros_,\" Pepe said. His uniform looked less strange on him\r\nin the blackout. \"We cracked the thick skull of the Falange today,\r\n_companeros_, but the black heart is still pumping.\"",
