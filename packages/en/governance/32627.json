The emphasis is on objective\r\ndescription of the nation's present society and the kinds of possible or\r\nprobable changes that might be expected in the future. The handbook\r\nseeks to present as full and as balanced an integrated exposition as\r\nlimitations on space and research time permit. It was compiled from\r\ninformation available in openly published material. An extensive\r\nbibliography is provided to permit recourse to other published sources\r\nfor more detailed information. There has been no attempt to express any\r\nspecific point of view or to make policy recommendations. The contents\r\nof the handbook represent the work of the authors and FAS and do not\r\nrepresent the official view of the United States government.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made to make the handbook as comprehensive as\r\npossible. It can be expected, however, that the material,\r\ninterpretations, and conclusions are subject to modification in the\r\nlight of new information and developments. Such corrections, additions,\r\nand suggestions for factual, interpretive, or other change as readers\r\nmay have will be welcomed for use in future revisions. Comments may be\r\naddressed to:\r\n\r\n The Director\r\n Foreign Area Studies\r\n The American University\r\n 5010 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W.\r\n Washington, D.C. 20016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough many changes have swept across the Eastern European communist\r\ncountries, Bulgaria through the years has remained a bastion of\r\nconsistency. It is a loyal military ally of the Soviet Union as a member\r\nof the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact), and its economy is\r\ninextricably linked to the Soviet Union through bilateral agreements as\r\nwell as through membership in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance\r\n(COMECON). Of the six Eastern European members of the Warsaw Pact,\r\nBulgaria shares with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the\r\ndistinction of not having contiguous borders with the Soviet Union. It\r\nis, however, important geographically because it anchors the\r\nsoutheastern sector of the alliance and borders two member states of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization--Greece and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the _Area Handbook for Bulgaria_ have attempted to\r\ndescribe, comprehensively and objectively, the workings of the economic,\r\npolitical, social, and military systems dominant in the country in the\r\nearly 1970s as those systems have developed in the post-World War II\r\nperiod. Despite the concentration on the communist era, important\r\nhistorical factors are referred to wherever necessary for understanding\r\nthe modern scene, and a historical chapter is included to provide the\r\nproper setting for the modern state.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of place names conforms to the transliteration system used\r\nby the United States Board on Geographic Names. The use of\r\nabbreviations, acronyms, and foreign terms has been held to a minimum.\r\nThe one abbreviation that necessarily appears throughout the work is BKP\r\nfor Bulgarian Communist Party (Bulgarska Komunisticheska Partiya). All\r\ntons are metric unless otherwise stated. A glossary is appended for\r\nconvenience, but all unfamiliar terms are explained on first use in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COUNTRY: People's Republic of Bulgaria. Proclaimed by the communist\r\nparty in the 1947 Constitution. Formerly, Kingdom of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n2. SIZE AND LOCATION: Area 42,800 square miles. Located in eastern part\r\nof Balkan Peninsula on Black Sea south of Danube River. Borders Romania,\r\nYugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey.\r\n\r\n3. TOPOGRAPHY: Mountains predominate in west and in ranges that run west\r\nto east across the central and southern regions. Lower and more level\r\nareas south of Danube River and between the mountain ranges permit\r\nextensive cultivation.\r\n\r\n4. CLIMATE: Transitional between Eastern European continental and\r\nMediterranean. Northern regions have hot summers, cold winters; south is\r\nmore moderate but has hot, dry summers.\r\n\r\n5. POPULATION: About 8.7 million in 1973; density 203 persons per square\r\nmile. Growth rate 0.7 percent annually.\r\n\r\n6. ETHNIC GROUPS AND LANGUAGES: 85 percent of population is Bulgar.\r\nPersons of Turkish, Macedonian, Greek, Romanian, and other origins are\r\nguaranteed the right to use their languages and to preserve their\r\ncultural heritage, but Bulgarian, the official language, is spoken by\r\nthe entire population.\r\n\r\n7. RELIGION: 90 percent of population adheres to the Eastern Orthodox\r\nfaith. There are some 750,000 Moslems, 26,000 Protestants, 32,000 Roman\r\nCatholics, and 3,000 to 7,000 Jews. Freedom of religion guaranteed, but\r\npractice strictly controlled by state.\r\n\r\n8. GOVERNMENT: National Assembly is unicameral legislature. Council of\r\nMinisters, performing governmental administrative functions, is\r\nresponsible to State Council, the supreme executive body. Real power\r\nvested in communist party's first secretary, Politburo, Secretariat, and\r\nCentral Committee.\r\n\r\n9. ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS: Administration is by people's councils at\r\ndistrict (_okrug_) and township or borough (_obshtina_) levels. There\r\nare twenty-eight districts, including one composed only of metropolitan\r\nSofia. Districts subdivided into about 1,150 townships and boroughs.\r\n\r\n10. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: Member of the Warsaw Treaty\r\nOrganization (Warsaw Pact); the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance\r\n(COMECON); and the United Nations (UN), including several UN specialized\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n11. JUSTICE: Three-level court system headed by Supreme Court. Military\r\nand special courts responsible directly to Supreme Court. Judiciary\r\nadministered by Ministry of Justice within Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n12. COMMUNICATIONS: Mass media are state owned and regulated. Little\r\nlatitude given subject matter produced locally; imports of foreign films\r\nand publications are restricted.\r\n\r\n13. EDUCATION: Free and compulsory until age fifteen. Priority on\r\nscientific, technological, and vocational curricula. Marxism-Leninism\r\nstressed in all curricula.\r\n\r\n14. ECONOMY: Production, growth, and development programmed in five-year\r\nplans, drawn up and monitored by party. The 1971-75 plan, dependent on\r\nfinancial and technical aid from Soviet Union, recognizes need to raise\r\nstandard of living; improvement is conditional upon rising productivity.\r\n\r\n15. LABOR: Work force numbers about 4.4 million. About 27 percent (1.2\r\nmillion) of the total are in state and collective industries; 25 percent\r\n(1.1 million) work full time on agroindustrial complexes. Skilled\r\nworkers in short supply.\r\n\r\n16. AGRICULTURE: Approximately 53 percent of land is agricultural, 69\r\npercent of which is cultivated. All but small mountain farms are\r\norganized into 170 agroindustrial complexes. Grains predominate on\r\nplains south of Danube River; irrigated Thracian Plain produces more\r\ndiversified crops. Livestock production inadequate for domestic needs\r\nand exports.\r\n\r\n17. INDUSTRY: Virtually all state owned. Rapid expansion encouraged by\r\nstate, increasingly slowed by inadequate raw material resources and\r\nskilled labor. Emphasis in early 1970s on improving unsatisfactory\r\nproductivity levels and quality of industrial products.\r\n\r\n18. FINANCE: Nonconvertible lev (see Glossary) has officially declared\r\nvalues ranging from 0.59 to 1.65 leva per US$1; unofficial rates in\r\nearly 1973 were substantially higher. Banking system consists of\r\nBulgarian National Bank and subordinated Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank\r\nand the State Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n19. FOREIGN TRADE: State monopoly administered by Ministry of Foreign\r\nTrade, Ministry of Finance, and the state banks. Bulk of trade is with\r\nSoviet Union and other COMECON countries.\r\n\r\n20. RAILROADS: Operational network totals about 2,620 miles, most of it\r\nstandard gauge. System carried bulk of long-distance domestic cargo and\r\npassenger traffic.\r\n\r\n21. ROADS: Total mileage about 21,000, but less than one-half has\r\nasphalt or other paved surface. Highway vehicles carry increasing\r\ntraffic, preponderance of short-haul cargo and passengers.\r\n\r\n22. INLAND WATERWAYS: Lower course of Danube River accommodates\r\n2,500-ton vessels. Black Sea and ocean commerce increasing rapidly.\r\n\r\n23. CIVIL AVIATION: State-owned Balkan-Bulgarian Airlines (BALKAN)\r\nconnects Sofia with about a dozen cities on internal routes and almost\r\ntwice as many foreign capitals.\r\n\r\n24. ARMED FORCES: Bulgarian People's Army is subordinate to Ministry of\r\nNational Defense. Ground forces have 80 percent of its personnel; air\r\nand naval forces, included in the army, have only about 15 and 5\r\npercent, respectively, of total strength.\r\n\r\n25. SECURITY: Ministry of Internal Affairs controls police and security\r\norganizations, except Border Troops, which are part of army. Party and\r\nmass organizations apply pressures on behalf of public order and in\r\ndefense of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIA\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n\r\n FOREWORD                                                            iii\r\n\r\n PREFACE                                                               v\r\n\r\n COUNTRY SUMMARY                                                     vii\r\n\r\n SECTION I.

SOCIAL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 Bulgaria was under the complete control of the Bulgarian\r\nCommunist Party (BKP--see Glossary) as it had been since the latter days\r\nof World War II. As that war came to a close, the Kingdom of Bulgaria\r\nwas occupied by the Soviet army and was governed by a coalition under\r\nthe communist-dominated Fatherland Front. By 1947 the monarchy had been\r\ndeposed, a new constitution had been promulgated, and the country had\r\nbecome the People's Republic of Bulgaria under the BKP. Todor Zhivkov,\r\nwho became first secretary of the party in 1954, retained that position\r\nin 1973 and, with nineteen years' tenure, was senior in length of\r\nservice among the top leaders of the Soviet-aligned, communist countries\r\nof Eastern Europe. Zhivkov, who weathered several years of intraparty\r\nstruggles after assuming the secretaryship, has led an apparently stable\r\nregime since an abortive coup d'etat failed to dislodge him in 1965. The\r\nhallmark of Zhivkov's leadership has been his intense loyalty to the\r\nleaders of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nZhivkov's critics accuse him of what they call subservience to the\r\nSoviet Union, stating that he relies on Soviet backing to remain in\r\npower. His supporters, on the other hand, commend him for his loyalty to\r\nthe Soviet Union, pointing out the historical affinity between the\r\nBulgarians and the Russians that dates back to the nineteenth-century\r\nRussian role in the liberation of Bulgaria from 500 years of Turkish\r\nrule. Whether he should be condemned or praised for it, the fact is that\r\nZhivkov has guided his ship of state in very close conformity with\r\ndirections first taken by the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nBulgaria, motivated mainly by irredentism, fought on the German side\r\nduring both world wars. The lands that Bulgaria coveted and pressed\r\nancient claims for were Macedonia (which had become part of Yugoslavia)\r\nand parts of Thrace (which had become Greek territory). Its claims to\r\nthese lands date back to the glorious days of Bulgarian kingdoms in the\r\nMiddle Ages, when its territory stretched from the Black Sea in the east\r\nto the Adriatic Sea in the west and from the Carpathian Mountains in the\r\nnorth to the Aegean Sea in the south. Five hundred years of Turkish rule\r\nfailed to erase the Bulgarian ideas of territorial grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe 1877-78 Russo-Turkish war that liberated Bulgaria ended in the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano, which reestablished a Bulgarian kingdom using the\r\nancient boundaries; but the treaty was never put into effect because the\r\nEuropean powers feared a large Russian client-state in the Balkans.\r\nMeeting in the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the powers nullified the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano and decreed Bulgarian boundaries that drastically\r\nreduced the size of the newly liberated country. Bulgaria seethed with\r\nirredentism and fought wars over the so-called lost territories until\r\nWorld War II, from which it emerged with a communist-dominated coalition\r\ngovernment but confined to almost the same boundaries. After the\r\nCommunists took complete control, irredentism was overshadowed by\r\nMarxist ideas of internationalism; but the dream of a greater Bulgaria\r\ndid not die, and irredentist opinions were commonly expressed until\r\n1972, when they were muted, probably on the insistence of the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe original Bulgars were of an Asian tribe that moved into the Balkan\r\nPeninsula as conquerors during the seventh century A.D. The occupants of\r\nthe area at the time were mostly Slavs who had been migrating to that\r\nregion for more than a century, absorbing former inhabitants as they\r\nsettled. Within about two centuries of their conquest, the Bulgars also\r\nhad been completely absorbed by the much more numerous Slavs, leaving\r\nonly their name to mark the land they had conquered. From the ninth\r\ncentury A.D. on, Bulgarian history is the story of this amalgamated\r\nnation of Bulgar-Slavs who enjoyed two different epochs of independent\r\nglory under medieval Bulgarian kingdoms but who also suffered invasion\r\nand defeat and, eventually, 500 years of domination by Ottoman Turks. In\r\n1878 Turkish rule was finally ended, and a truncated Bulgaria reappeared\r\non the map of Europe. After five centuries of foreign domination,\r\nBulgaria was backward, underdeveloped, and poor.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the Bulgar-Slavs made up the majority of the\r\napproximately 8.7 million people living in Bulgaria in 1973. The largest\r\nminority group, which numbered about 0.7 million people, was Turkish.\r\nThe few Greeks, Romanians, Armenians, and Jews in the population\r\ncollectively accounted for only about 1 percent of the total. These\r\nmodern Bulgarians live in a country that is almost rectangular in shape\r\nand covers roughly 42,800 square miles of the lower Balkan Peninsula.\r\nTheir country is bounded on the east by the Black Sea, on the south by\r\nGreece and the part of Turkey that is in Europe, on the west by\r\nYugoslavia, and on the north by Romania.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent communist leader of Bulgaria was Georgi Dimitrov, a\r\nnative-born Bulgarian who had lived in exile during most of the period\r\nbetween the two world wars and had become a Soviet citizen in 1935.\r\nDimitrov was prominent in the international communist movement and,\r\nwhile resident in Moscow, had served as secretary general of the\r\nComintern (Communist International), founded under Lenin's guidance in\r\n1919. Dimitrov returned to his homeland in late 1945, resumed his\r\nBulgarian citizenship, and took over the leadership of the BKP and the\r\ngovernment. He was instrumental in developing the 1947 Constitution\r\n(usually referred to as the Dimitrov Constitution) and set about\r\nremaking his country's economic, political, and social structures in the\r\nSoviet image. Nationalization of all means of production,\r\ncollectivization of agriculture, and an ambitious program of\r\nindustrialization all commenced under Dimitrov.\r\n\r\nDimitrov died in 1949 but, before he died, his programs were well under\r\nway, the Moscow-oriented BKP was in complete control, and the country\r\nwas firmly in the Soviet orbit. Several years later, even though the\r\nterm _satellite_ was no longer used to describe the Eastern European\r\ncountries aligned with the Soviet Union, Bulgaria was considered to be\r\nthe most rigidly loyal of all former Soviet satellites. Shortly after\r\nthe death of Dimitrov, the top position of leadership was secured by\r\nVulko Chervenkov who, over the next few years, earned a reputation as\r\nBulgaria's version of Stalin. After Stalin died, Chervenkov's power base\r\neroded to the point that he was forced to give up the top party post in\r\nfavor of Zhivkov; Chervenkov retained the top position in the\r\ngovernment, however, and remained on the scene as an opposing locus of\r\npolitical power. The intraparty factional strife that ensued lasted into\r\nthe 1960s, but Zhivkov, who had established a close relationship with\r\nSoviet party leader Nikita Khrushchev, eventually overcame the\r\nopposition and stabilized his regime. Zhivkov also managed to establish\r\nclose relations with the Soviet leaders who ousted Khrushchev and has\r\napparently maintained good rapport with Leonid Brezhnev, the general\r\nsecretary of the Soviet party.\r\n\r\nThe BKP in 1973 was structured very much like the Communist Party of the\r\nSoviet Union. The structure is pyramidal in form, the general membership\r\nmaking up the base and the office of first secretary occupying the apex.\r\nBetween the two extremes the most important bodies from bottom to top\r\nare the Party Congress, the Central Committee, the Secretariat, and the\r\nPolitburo. The Party Congress is a large gathering of delegates,\r\nrepresenting the rank and file, that meets every five years,\r\ntheoretically, to make party policy, amend party statutes if necessary,\r\nand determine the party program for the ensuing five-year period.\r\nActually the congress is a large, unwieldy body (over 1,500 delegates at\r\nthe 1971 congress), which meets to demonstrate solidarity rather than to\r\nmake policy. The congress, by party statute, elects the Central\r\nCommittee, which is a permanently sitting body that acts in the name of\r\nthe congress during the long intervals when the larger body is not in\r\nsession. The so-called election of the Central Committee is, in fact, a\r\nratification of preselected members. The same holds true for the\r\nelection of the Politburo and the Secretariat by the Central\r\nCommittee--in effect, the Politburo has already determined its own\r\nmembership and that of the Secretariat, and the election process by the\r\nCentral Committee is unanimous confirmation rather than election,\r\nmaking the Politburo a self-perpetuating body.\r\n\r\nThe Politburo for policymaking and the Secretariat for policy\r\nimplementation are the true centers of power in the overall\r\nparty-government system. The Central Committee is an operating body and\r\nis made up of important members of the party, although they rank below\r\nthe small group that has reached the top echelons of the structure. It\r\nis the interlocking of various party and government positions that\r\nreally concentrates power in the hands of a few individuals and permits\r\nthe ultimate leader, Zhivkov, to control the entire apparatus. Zhivkov\r\nhimself is an example of the interlocking in that, since 1971, he has\r\nbeen the first secretary of the party and a member of the Politburo at\r\nthe same time that he was the president of the governmental State\r\nCouncil. Only one other individual in 1973 combined membership in the\r\nparty's most prestigious bodies--Politburo and Secretariat--with\r\nmembership in the government's leading body--the State Council. Two\r\nother party secretaries were candidate (nonvoting) members of the\r\nPolitburo, but they did not concurrently hold any high government\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe government established under the Dimitrov Constitution, as changed\r\nby the Constitution of 1971, is the instrument through which the party\r\nadministers the country. The central government consists, essentially,\r\nof the National Assembly, the State Council, and the Council of\r\nMinisters. The unicameral National Assembly is described in the\r\nconstitution as \"a supreme body of state power,\" whereas the State\r\nCouncil is described as \"a supreme constantly functioning body of state\r\npower.\" In practice, if one or the other were to be described as the\r\nsingle supreme body of state power, it would be the State Council, the\r\nmembership of which in 1973 included seven (out of twenty-four) members\r\nor candidate members of the party Politburo and the operations of which,\r\nduring its first two years of existence, have stamped it with the mark\r\nof supreme authority.\r\n\r\nThe role of the National Assembly as a legislative body is circumscribed\r\nby the infrequency of its meetings. The assembly is popularly elected\r\nfrom a single list of nominees at five-year intervals, but it is\r\nrequired to meet only three times annually. The sessions of the assembly\r\nare usually so brief that it functions as an after-the-fact approving\r\nbody rather than as a legislature. The development and initiation of new\r\nlegislation, therefore, is handled outside of the actual legislature,\r\nprimarily by the State Council and the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\nAt its first session after general elections the National Assembly\r\nelects the State Council, but it would be highly unlikely if not\r\nimpossible for the assembly to refuse to elect the complete slate of\r\nnominees that has been preselected by the party hierarchy. The election\r\nof the State Council, therefore, as is the case with various party\r\nelections, is a unanimous vote of approval rather than a true election.\r\nThe State Council is the true center of the government. When it was\r\ncreated by the 1971 Constitution, Zhivkov chose to relinquish his\r\ngovernmental post as chairman of the Council of Ministers (the\r\ncountry's premier) and assume the position of president of the State\r\nCouncil, leaving no doubt about where real governmental power lay. The\r\nState Council, in effect, is a collective executive body that, because\r\nthe National Assembly meets so infrequently, also becomes a major\r\ninitiator of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers, also elected by the National Assembly in the\r\nsame manner as the State Council, functions as the administrative arm of\r\nthe government. Here again, party influence is pervasive. In 1973 the\r\nchairman of the council (premier) and four deputy chairmen were\r\nconcurrently members of the party Politburo, the minister of internal\r\naffairs was a candidate member of the Politburo, and most other\r\nministers were members of the Central Committee.\r\n\r\nMatters of state--such as defense, foreign affairs, education, and\r\nwelfare--usually associated with the central government of any country\r\nare handled by individual ministries and are overseen by the Council of\r\nMinisters. In addition to such affairs of state, however, various\r\nministries, as well as the council itself, are charged with\r\nadministering the country's entire economy, as is the case in other\r\ncommunist-ruled states. In mid-1973 eleven ministries out of a total of\r\ntwenty-two dealt exclusively with economic matters. In addition, the\r\nState Planning Committee, the chairman of which holds ministerial rank,\r\nis of great importance in the overall economic structure.\r\n\r\nThe economic ministries control virtually every aspect of the country's\r\neconomy. The goals of nationalization of all industry and\r\ncollectivization of agriculture were achieved early in the communist\r\nera, and the efforts of the party-government ever since have been toward\r\nincreased efficiency. In Bulgaria the quest for greater production has\r\nled to ever greater centralization of control. In the early 1970s this\r\nquest has brought about the reorganization of industry wherein\r\nindustrial enterprises have been grouped into huge trusts at the same\r\ntime that collective and state farms have been similarly grouped into\r\nso-called agroindustrial complexes.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of agriculture into extremely large complexes, begun\r\nin 1970, was intended to raise productivity through concentration of\r\neffort, specialization of production, and increased control by the\r\ncentral government. The reorganization is a long-range program that is\r\nexpected to be completed by 1980, at which time authorities predict that\r\nfarm incomes will have risen to equal industrial incomes and, because\r\nagricultural enterprises will be run just like factories, the social\r\ndifferences between peasants and workers will have been eliminated. By\r\n1973 results of the reorganization that had already occurred were mixed,\r\nand it was still too early to assess the long-range value of the\r\nagroindustrial complexes.\r\n\r\nIn the industrial sector the consolidation of various enterprises into\r\ntrusts was undertaken in the early 1970s for the same reasons that the\r\nagroindustrial complexes were formed, that is, greater efficiency\r\nthrough concentration, specialization, and increased control. Bulgarian\r\nindustrial growth since World War II had been remarkable, considering\r\nparticularly the inadequate base of skilled labor and natural resources\r\nin a country that had been predominantly agricultural. Bulgaria's need\r\nfor raw materials, machinery, and technological assistance during its\r\nlong period of industrialization and the Soviet Union's willingness to\r\nsupply them accounted in large measure for the extremely close economic\r\nties between the two countries. Because the growth rate had begun to\r\nslow toward the end of the 1960s, the BKP decided to try a massive\r\nreorganization of the economic structure as a remedy for the situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the political and economic systems of the country, the\r\nsocial system has been a major concern of the party and government ever\r\nsince the BKP took power. Social restructuring has resulted in a system\r\nwherein the party elite occupies the highest level. This group is small\r\nand represents the apex of the social pyramid. The next level down,\r\nwhich is much broader, includes lesser party functionaries,\r\nprofessionals, administrators and managers, technicians, and all\r\nwhite-collar workers. The next level is made up of blue-collar\r\nindustrial workers, who constitute the largest group in the society. At\r\nthe bottom of the structure are the peasants. There are, of course,\r\ngradations of power, privilege, and prestige within all of the social\r\ngroupings. The society has been very mobile since World War II with\r\nrapid upward mobility based mainly on the expanding economy,\r\nindustrialization, and modernization. Toward the end of the 1960s, as\r\nthe economic growth rate slowed, so also did the social mobility, and\r\nthere was evidence that social groups were stabilizing.\r\n\r\nEducation has been the key to upward mobility and, since coming to\r\npower, the Communists have given preference in educational opportunity\r\nto formerly underprivileged groups. At the beginning of the 1970s,\r\nhowever, the percentage of students of worker and peasant origin\r\nenrolled in institutions of higher learning was far below the percentage\r\nof workers and peasants in the population. Students from the lower\r\nincome groups have not competed favorably against those from more\r\nadvantaged backgrounds and, although upward mobility is not blocked, it\r\nhas been becoming more difficult. Membership in the BKP remains\r\nimportant for persons desiring to move upward in the social structure.\r\n\r\nFor the leadership the importance of education lies in the fact that it\r\nis the best means for orienting the people in the official ideology as\r\nwell as for training the professionals, technicians, and skilled workers\r\nneeded to run the country. The ideological indoctrination is pervasive\r\nthroughout the entire school system, but the concurrent goal of meeting\r\nthe needs of the economy has suffered because the system of higher\r\neducation has not expanded rapidly enough to absorb most secondary\r\nschool graduates who are desirous and capable of pursuing higher\r\nstudies. Many educational reforms have been enacted over the years, but\r\nthey have been cautious and limited and have not attacked the major\r\nproblem of providing much greater funding for higher education.\r\n\r\nIn the cultural sphere the party and government have promoted pride in\r\nthe ancient Bulgarian heritage but have regulated art, music, and\r\nliterature in order to bring about conformity with the Soviet-developed\r\ndoctrine of Socialist Realism. Throughout the communist era there have\r\nbeen periods of freeze and thaw in the controls imposed on artists and\r\nintellectuals, but the periods of greatest restriction in later years\r\nhave not equaled the severity of the Stalinist times. In the 1960s and\r\nearly 1970s control has been exercised primarily through publishers, art\r\ngalleries, theaters, and other outlets. Artists and intellectuals know\r\nthat their work must pass through state-owned outlets if it is to be\r\nseen or heard; therefore, they exercise self-censorship to ensure\r\nacceptability. Other means of control are the professional unions that\r\nall artists, writers, and actors must join if their work is to be\r\nexhibited or published. The unions are run by the BKP and, in effect,\r\nbecome instruments through which the party promotes its cultural\r\npolicies. For some artists conformity with ideological goals leads to\r\nupward social mobility, and some enjoy privileges and life-styles that\r\nare usually reserved for the ruling elite.\r\n\r\nFor control of the general population the government relies on the\r\nregular police, court, and penal systems, which are supplemented by\r\nstate security police, paramilitary police auxiliaries, and militarized\r\nborder guards. The regular police forces, the auxiliaries, and the state\r\nsecurity police are all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs, whereas the border guards are subordinated to the army\r\nand are regulated by the Ministry of National Defense. Courts and penal\r\ninstitutions are under the Ministry of Justice.\r\n\r\nAlso as means of control, the government sanctions and the party\r\noperates a number of mass organizations that affect or influence the\r\nlives of most people in the country. The Fatherland Front is a large\r\numbrella organization that includes all other groups as well as\r\nindividual members. The other mass organizations include trade unions,\r\nyouth groups, athletic societies, and similar interest groups. Other\r\nthan these officially sanctioned groups, there are no organizations\r\npermitted and, because the party retains control through the leadership\r\npositions, all organized activity in the country comes under BKP\r\nsupervision. Such organizations also serve as upward channels of\r\ninformation through which the party hierarchy is able to keep in touch\r\nwith popular opinion.\r\n\r\nMilitarily, Bulgaria in 1973 maintained about 160,000 men in its armed\r\nforces, which are committed to the Soviet-dominated alliance known as\r\nthe Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact). Ground forces constitute\r\nthe great bulk of the so-called Bulgarian People's Army, but it also\r\nincludes a small air and air defense force, a small naval force, and the\r\nborder guards. All of the armed forces are under the supervision of the\r\nMinistry of National Defense, but top-level policymaking is a\r\nprerogative of the BKP. The party maintains great influence in the armed\r\nforces through the officer corps, 85 percent of which is made up of\r\nparty members. Those officers who are not party members usually belong\r\nto the communist youth organization. Many career noncommissioned\r\nofficers are also party members and, for the conscript in the ranks,\r\npolitical indoctrination is as regular as his military training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SETTING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Bulgaria is marked by four interrelated motifs or themes.\r\nThe first motif is that of regional rivalry coupled with irredentism.\r\nThe second is Bulgaria's strategic significance for the leading powers\r\nof Europe and the varying relationships with those powers. The third\r\ntheme is Bulgaria's constant conflict between loyalty to, and alliances\r\nwith, the East--particularly Russia and the Soviet Union--on the one\r\nhand and to the West--particularly Italy and Germany--on the other. The\r\nfourth major theme in Bulgarian history is the influence exerted by\r\nRussia (and the Soviet Union) on the internal and external affairs of\r\nBulgaria. This influence was intermittent from the late nineteenth\r\ncentury until World War II but was constant after that war.\r\n\r\nFrom its earliest history Bulgaria was in continual conflict with its\r\nBalkan neighbors. The area that eventually became Bulgaria was the\r\nobject of regional disputes as early as the fourth century B.C. Later,\r\nwhen that area was taken over by the Slavs in the sixth century A.D. and\r\nthe Bulgars in the seventh, a state evolved that proceeded to encroach\r\non the territory of the mighty Byzantine Empire itself. Despite\r\nsuccessful raids and conquests during the periods of the First Bulgarian\r\nKingdom and the Second Bulgarian Kingdom, Bulgaria was eventually\r\nreduced to subject status by the Byzantines and later by the Ottoman\r\nTurks. During Turkish rule the country was not only under constant\r\nattack by neighbors but was also utilized by the Turks as a base for\r\nTurkish expansion. When Bulgaria was finally liberated from the Turks by\r\nthe Russians, irredentism and regional rivalry became the prime focus of\r\nits foreign policy. Macedonia, a much-valued land throughout Bulgarian\r\nhistory, became the major object of Bulgaria's irredentist campaigns,\r\nalthough eventually most of the land reverted to Serbia and was later\r\nincorporated into Yugoslavia. Macedonia, in addition to Thrace, which\r\nwas valued because it provided access to the sea, was the primary motive\r\nfor Bulgaria's role not only in the two Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 but\r\nalso in the two world wars.\r\n\r\nBulgaria was not only struggling for power throughout its history; it\r\nwas also a pawn in the power struggles of the so-called great powers.\r\nBefore the Christian era the area was conquered first by Greece and\r\nlater by Rome and was influenced strongly by both of these early\r\ncultures. Later, when the Slavs and Bulgars succeeded in forming a\r\nunited state, the country was still besieged by both Byzantium and\r\nRome. Although the Romans eventually lost their hold over Bulgaria, the\r\nByzantine Empire took both political and religious control of the\r\ncountry for two centuries. When Bulgaria managed to reassert its\r\nautonomy in the time of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom, independence was\r\nshort lived, and the country again fell under alien control, this time\r\nto the Ottoman Turks. The Turks dominated Bulgaria for five centuries,\r\nuntil liberation by the Russians temporarily gave the country full\r\nsovereignty. Before each of the two world wars of the twentieth century,\r\nBulgaria was actively courted by both sides as a potentially strategic\r\nally. Realizing Bulgaria's territorial aspirations, Germany played upon\r\nBulgarian irredentism in order to gain its collaboration in the wars,\r\nand both times Bulgaria emerged on the losing side. When World War II\r\nended for Bulgaria in 1944, it fell under Soviet influence, where it has\r\nremained ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe history of the country that became modern Bulgaria can be traced\r\nback many hundreds of years before the time of Christ, predating by\r\nfifteen or more centuries the arrival of the people known as Bulgars,\r\nfrom whom the country ultimately took its name. The earliest people to\r\nhave a viable political organization in the area were the Thracians,\r\nwhose loosely organized tribes occupied and controlled much of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula. Later, when their society began to disintegrate, the\r\nThracians fell under Greek influence and joined forces with Athens to\r\noverrun neighboring Macedonia. In the fourth century B.C., however,\r\nPhilip of Macedon, competing with the Greeks in a power struggle over\r\nThrace, conquered Thrace and made the Thracians a subject people.\r\n\r\nThis invasion was followed in the second century B.C. by a Roman\r\ninvasion of Macedonia and a subsequent conquest of Thrace. By the first\r\ncentury A.D. the Romans totally dominated the area. Despite their strict\r\nand unpopular military control over the population, under their tutelage\r\ncities grew, roads were constructed, and mining and farming were\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIn the third century A.D. a series of mass migrations into the Balkans\r\nbegan; these migrations lasted for several centuries (see ch. 3). The\r\nGoths came in four separate waves during the third century. In the\r\nfourth century the Huns swept across the country, razing cities and\r\nvillages. They were followed in the fourth and fifth centuries by the\r\nVisigoths and Ostrogoths who, like the Huns, continued to ravage the\r\ncountry. These invasions culminated in the eventual conquest and\r\nsettlement by the relatively civilized Slavs in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 330 the Emperor Constantine established what was to be\r\nconsidered a second Rome and named it Constantinople. In this period the\r\nRoman Empire in the Balkans was split into two parts: in the east,\r\nThrace was once again under Greek domination, and the west was\r\ndominated by the Romans. Constantinople was growing in power, and Greek\r\ninfluence was eroding the political and cultural influence of the\r\nRomans. By the mid-fourth century Rome and Constantinople were actively\r\nstruggling for domination over the Balkans.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century A.D. the Slavs crossed the Danube River and\r\noccupied much of the Balkan Peninsula. Although the Byzantines built\r\nfortresses to protect themselves, they were unable to hold the Slavs at\r\nbay. Once the Slavs had taken over most of the Balkan Peninsula, they\r\nsucceeded in destroying the existing social system, rapidly replacing it\r\nwith their own. Soon the entire Thracian population became slavicized.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century A.D. the Bulgars in turn began to migrate into\r\nthe Balkans. They had come originally from central Asia and were said to\r\nbe related to the Huns. They were of the same stock as the Turks and\r\nspoke a language similar to Turkish. Before migrating to the Balkans,\r\nthey had lived north of the Black Sea. Their social order was vastly\r\ndifferent from that of the Slavs, although eventually the Slavic system\r\nbecame dominant. The Bulgars, unlike the Slavs who repudiated the\r\nconcept of kingship, were governed autocratically by khans. The Bulgars\r\nwere warriors who fought on horseback, and their customs and dress were\r\nAsiatic.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bulgars overran what is now northeastern Bulgaria, they found\r\nSlavic tribes already established and quickly made peace with them in\r\norder to strengthen themselves against the Byzantines. As the Slavs were\r\nfar more numerous than the Bulgars, the latter were assimilated, and\r\nwithin two centuries the Bulgars had been completely slavicized. The\r\nSlavic language and culture were adopted, although the Bulgarian name\r\nand political structure were retained. A Slav-Bulgarian state was formed\r\nwith the capital at Pliska.\r\n\r\nThe First Bulgarian Kingdom lasted from A.D. 679 to A.D. 1018, when it\r\nfell to Byzantium. During this period the social system resembled the\r\nfeudal system of Western Europe. The king, or tsar, was the leading\r\nnobleman. As the political situation of the period varied, he was\r\nalternately supported or opposed by the boyars (large landowners). The\r\ngreat majority of the people were serfs.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. the Bulgarians consolidated\r\nand further reinforced their power. By the ninth century they were so\r\npowerful that they challenged the Byzantine Empire itself. Twice in this\r\nperiod the Bulgarians controlled areas of Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia,\r\nRomania, and even Russia. In a battle in 811 the Bulgars completely\r\ndevastated the Byzantine army that had invaded their country; killed the\r\nByzantine emperor, Nicephorus; and went on to lay siege to\r\nConstantinople itself. The siege failed, but Bulgaria had established\r\nitself as a power with which to be reckoned.\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth century A.D. Bulgaria once again became the focus of\r\nGreek and Roman cultural and political rivalry. The dispute was finally\r\nterminated when Bulgaria, under King Boris I, accepted Christianity\r\nfrom Constantinople rather than from Rome. As early as 836 the Byzantine\r\nEmpire had sent two brothers, Cyril and Methodius, to convert the Slavs.\r\nWhen the brothers were in Venice, they argued in favor of church\r\nservices and literature in the Slavic language, opposing the Roman\r\nbishops who believed that only Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were suitable\r\nlanguages for worship. This dialogue further exacerbated the tensions\r\nbetween Byzantium and Rome. By 870 Boris made Orthodox Christianity the\r\nofficial religion of the state. At this juncture Bulgaria fell under the\r\nByzantine sphere of influence, completing--for the moment--its break\r\nwith the Roman religion and culture.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Cyril and Methodius upon the Bulgarian language and\r\nculture is incalculable. They not only carried a new liturgical form to\r\nBulgaria but also devised a new alphabet known as Cyrillic. This new\r\nalphabet soon replaced Latin and Greek as the only form of writing, and\r\non its base a new Slavic literature and culture grew up.\r\n\r\nWhen Bulgaria adopted Christianity from Byzantium, it also adopted\r\nByzantium's territorial ambitions. Under Tsar Simeon (A.D. 893-927), a\r\nperiod known as the Golden Age, Bulgaria extended its territories from\r\nthe Black Sea in the east to the southern Carpathian Mountains in the\r\nnorth, to the Sava River in the west, and to Macedonia in the southwest.\r\nIt was in this period that Bulgaria reached the peak of its territorial\r\nexpansion, penetrating deep into the Byzantine Empire. Macedonia and\r\nAlbania became Bulgaria's new frontiers; in 924 Serbia fell under\r\nBulgarian rule. With these victories Simeon claimed the title tsar of\r\nall the Bulgarians and the Greeks.\r\n\r\nWith the territorial expansion came a domestic flourishing in the arts\r\nand an increase in trade. The arts and architecture of the period were\r\nsignificant for their beauty and vitality. Preslav, then the capital\r\ncity, became the center of culture. Crafts, such as goldsmithing,\r\npottery, stonemasonry, and blacksmithing grew, and shops sprang up\r\neverywhere. At the same time literature flourished, and education and\r\nscholarship took on a new importance. Knowledge of Slavic literature\r\nbecame widespread, and writers treated such varied topics as religion,\r\ngrammar, logic, and patriotism.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the tenth century A.D., however, the First Bulgarian\r\nKingdom was beginning to decline. Internally, the local population was\r\nweary from continual warring and from the oppression of feudalism. The\r\nboyars continued to struggle against the king and his council for their\r\nown autonomy. Because of the internal weakness of the country,\r\nBulgaria's neighbors began to encroach on her borders. The Magyars\r\n(Hungarians) attacked from the northwest, seizing territory north of the\r\nDanube River. The Byzantines in 967 formed an alliance with the prince\r\nof Kiev in Russia and, because of this alliance, succeeded in invading\r\nBulgaria repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn the late tenth century there was a brief revival of Bulgarian power\r\nunder Samuel, when the Bulgarians succeeded in liberating the\r\nnortheastern sector of the country from Byzantine control and captured\r\nsouthern Macedonia. But the revival was short lived. The Byzantine\r\nemperor, Basil II, was determined to regain his lost land and once again\r\nrecaptured the northeastern sector. In 1014 Basil again invaded\r\nBulgaria; defeated Samuel's army; and, in an act of matchless cruelty,\r\nblinded 14,000 Bulgarian soldiers. From 1018 until 1185 all of Bulgaria\r\nwas under Byzantine rule.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh and twelfth centuries witnessed a period of extreme\r\nhardship for the country. Byzantine domination was harsh and punitive.\r\nMonetary taxes, which added to the already heavy burdens of the\r\npeasantry, were levied in 1040. Bulgarian feudalism was replaced by\r\nByzantine feudalism. The Byzantine church itself was a vehicle of\r\noppression as it was later to become under Turkish rule; the church\r\nowned entire estates and villages and the people who inhabited them.\r\nThere were a series of revolts during the eleventh century, but none\r\nwere successful in overthrowing Byzantine tyranny. During this period\r\nthe first and second crusades made their way through the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, wreaking havoc among the local populations.\r\n\r\nThe Second Bulgarian Kingdom was established in 1186 and lasted until\r\n1396, when--like the First Bulgarian Kingdom--it was conquered by a\r\npowerful enemy and neighbor. Ironically, history came full circle to\r\nspell defeat for the Bulgarians. In the twelfth century, when the\r\nByzantine Empire was declining because of internal weakness, the\r\nBulgarians were able to free themselves from domination. In the\r\nfourteenth century, when Bulgaria itself was weakened by domestic\r\nstrife, it was conquered by an enemy whose oppression was greater than\r\nthat of the Byzantine Empire: the Ottoman Turks.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the twelfth century the internal situation in Bulgaria\r\nwas deteriorating. Taxes had been increased, and the burden borne by the\r\npeasants became still heavier. The feudal lords openly began to proclaim\r\ntheir independence from Byzantium, whose empire was by now steadily\r\ndeclining. Bulgaria was surrounded by its enemies: the Ottoman Turks,\r\nthe Magyars, and the Normans. In 1183 the Magyars invaded, penetrating\r\nas far as Sofia. Realizing the vulnerability of the Byzantine Empire,\r\nthe Bulgarians rebelled under the leadership of two brothers, Asen and\r\nPeter. The brothers first liberated northeastern Bulgaria and then\r\nproceeded into Thrace, where they were opposed by Isaac Angel, then\r\nemperor of Byzantium. In 1187 a peace treaty was concluded in which\r\nByzantium conceded autonomy to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nDespite the peace treaty, however, the Bulgarians continued to wage war\r\nagainst the empire, hoping to regain northern Bulgaria and Macedonia--a\r\ncontested territory and bitterly disputed issue throughout Bulgarian\r\nhistory. In 1201 the empire again concluded a peace treaty with the\r\nBulgarians, ceding all of northern Bulgaria and a large part of\r\nMacedonia. Eventually, in 1207 Constantinople recognized the complete\r\nindependence of Bulgaria, and Bulgarian freedom was firmly established.\r\n\r\nThis new-found independence, however, did not extend to the Bulgarian\r\nchurch, which was still under the aegis of the empire. For that reason\r\nKaloyan, the Bulgarian ruler, negotiated with the Roman pope, Innocent\r\nIII, in order to ally the Bulgarian church with the church of Rome. The\r\nmotives of Rome and those of Kaloyan were similar: to isolate the\r\ninfluence of Byzantium from Bulgaria. In 1204 Kaloyan was crowned king\r\nby the papal nuncio in Turnovo. Although this union lasted only briefly,\r\nit served the purpose for which it was designed, and Bulgaria was\r\neffectively cut off from Byzantium.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteenth century the Holy Roman Empire replaced the\r\nByzantine Empire on the borders of Bulgaria, and Byzantine aggression\r\nwas replaced by that of the Holy Roman Empire. When Rome declared war on\r\nBulgaria, the Bulgarians invaded Thrace, defeating the crusaders at\r\nAdrianople in 1205. The reestablishment of the Bulgarian patriarchate in\r\n1235 represented the end of the short-lived alliance between the\r\nBulgarian church and Rome.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Ivan Asen II in the mid-thirteenth century peace was\r\nagain restored, and the country once more extended its territories. The\r\nBulgarians succeeded in capturing eastern Thrace, the Aegean coast,\r\nAlbania, and Macedonia. Bulgarian territory at this time was as great as\r\nunder the reign of Tsar Simeon; with these conquests Bulgaria became the\r\nlargest state in the Balkans. The country was now surrounded by three\r\nseas--the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, and the Adriatic Sea--opening the\r\ncountry's doors to foreign trade and culture.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in the time of Simeon, the arts and cultural life of the\r\ncountry flourished. Monasteries, churches, and fortresses were\r\nconstructed. Religious literature and art achieved a high level of\r\nexcellence, and secular works became popular. The first chronicle of\r\nBulgarian history was written, and an interest in history grew among the\r\npeople. The first Bulgarian coins were minted at this time. Trade,\r\nparticularly with Italy, increased greatly because of Bulgaria's free\r\naccess to the sea. Merchants and ambassadors came to Bulgaria from\r\nabroad, lending their influence to Bulgaria's economic and cultural\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBy the second half of the thirteenth century, however, internal\r\nconditions in the country had deteriorated. The feudal system, which had\r\nbeen further consolidated during the thirteenth century, had exacerbated\r\nthe tensions of the peasants, and hostilities among the boyars\r\nincreased. The throne was contested between 1257 and 1277 and was\r\neventually taken forcibly by Ivailo, known as the swineherd tsar because\r\nof his leadership of a peasant uprising in 1277.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria's neighbors again sensed an opportune time to attack\r\nbecause of the internal divisions in the country. The Byzantines\r\nconquered several parts of Macedonia and Thrace, and the Hungarians and\r\nTatars invaded on another front. At one point the Hungarian king\r\ndeclared himself king of Bulgaria. In 1242 there was a large-scale\r\nMongol invasion. Tatar raids went on continually between 1241 and 1300.\r\nThe country was totally fragmented; each separate area attempted to ally\r\nitself with its former enemies, whether Russian, Hungarian, or Tatar, in\r\norder to prevent widespread damage.\r\n\r\nBy the fourteenth century the Turks began to envision the conquest of\r\nBulgaria. Internally the boyars continued to fight among themselves, and\r\nexternally the country was threatened alternately by Byzantium and by\r\nSerbia. By the mid-fourteenth century all of Macedonia was under Serbian\r\ncontrol, and the Serbian tsar--much like the Hungarian king before\r\nhim--called himself the tsar of the Bulgars. The area of the country\r\nretained by the Bulgars by this time was divided into three parts: the\r\nlast Bulgarian tsar maintained his capital at Turnovo in the central\r\nhighlands; the so-called Vidin Kingdom, ruled by the tsar's brother,\r\nexisted in the far northwest; and a principality of Dobrudzha was\r\nestablished in the northeast.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Ottoman Turks were beginning to advance. Having\r\nseized areas of Asia Minor, they proceeded to raid the Balkans from 1326\r\nto 1352. Under their leader, Murad I, they began to attack Thrace,\r\nMacedonia, and parts of Bulgaria. By 1371 they were attacking\r\nterritories in northeastern Thrace. At this point they marched against\r\nSofia and, despite active resistance, succeeded in capturing it. Despite\r\nan alliance with the Serbs, the Bulgarians were too weak to resist\r\nfurther; in 1388 the Turks easily won a battle against the Serbs. The\r\nfall of Turnovo was followed by the fall of Vidin and Dobrudzha. By 1396\r\nall of Bulgaria was under Turkish domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH RULE\r\n\r\nThe Second Bulgarian Kingdom, like the first, had ended in total defeat,\r\nand the darkest period in Bulgarian history began with the Turkish\r\nconquest. Only the priests of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church--despite its\r\ntakeover by the Greeks--were able to preserve Bulgarian national\r\nliterature and culture to some degree. The Bulgarians once again were\r\nsubjected to foreign domination, only this time foreign rule lasted for\r\nfive centuries. Historians agree that Turkish rule was a death blow to\r\nthe creative forces that had been responsible for the development of the\r\ncountry to that time. With Turkish domination the normal economic,\r\npolitical, and social life of Bulgaria ground to a halt.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Turks were at a far lower stage of social development than\r\neither the Byzantine Empire, which preceded them in their occupation of\r\nthe Balkans, or the Balkan states themselves. The Turks lived an almost\r\nnomadic life in primitive communal systems that were headed by tribal\r\nchiefs. When the Turks occupied Bulgaria, they replaced the established\r\nfeudal system with their own more rudimentary and conservative\r\nfeudalism. Many boyars were executed or rendered powerless if they\r\nfailed to convert to Islam. The peasants were more completely under the\r\nfeudal yoke than they had ever been under Byzantine rule. The Turks\r\nimposed heavy taxes and hard labor on the people of the conquered\r\ncountry, whom they considered cattle. Young boys were taken from their\r\nhomes, proclaimed Muslims, and conscripted into the army.\r\n\r\nThe Turks ruled Bulgaria by means of a sharply delineated administrative\r\nsystem. Bulgaria as an entity did not exist for the Turks; the entire\r\nBalkan Peninsula was known as Rumili (Rumelia) and was ruled for the\r\nsultan by a _beylerbey_ (governor general) whose headquarters was\r\nlocated in Sofia. Rumili was divided into _vilayetlar_ (sing.,\r\n_vilayet_), which were further subdivided into _sanjaklar_ (sing.,\r\n_sanjak_), each in turn ruled by lesser officials. Bulgaria itself was\r\ndivided into five _sanjaklar_: Kyustendil, Nikopol, Silistra, Sofia, and\r\nVidin. Although all land was considered to be the property of the\r\nsultan, on the local level the land was distributed to feudal lords and\r\nwas tilled by non-Muslim serfs.\r\n\r\nA second vehicle for both administration and oppression that the Turks\r\nemployed--in addition to the land administrators--was the Greek Orthodox\r\nChurch. By 1394, before the final conquest, the See of Turnovo had been\r\nsubordinated to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, where it remained\r\nuntil 1870. Greek bishops replaced Bulgarians, as Greek liturgy replaced\r\nthe Slavic. The patriarchate, in turn, was totally subordinate to the\r\nsultan. The Greek clergy destroyed Bulgarian books and banned Slavic\r\nliturgy. The Bulgarian language and all Slavic literature were\r\nforbidden. Greek became the language in all schools.\r\n\r\nThe hellenization of the Bulgarian church was used by the Turks as a\r\nmeans to negate the nationalism of the people and thus dominate them.\r\nThe Turks attempted to some extent to convert the Bulgarians to Islam in\r\norder to assimilate them more fully. Although many Bulgarians fled to\r\nthe mountains with the coming of the Turks, others stayed on and\r\naccepted the Muslim faith, often for purely opportunistic purposes.\r\nThose who did were generally placed in strategically significant\r\npositions; frequently, as a reward for their conversion, they paid no\r\ntaxes to the state. The Bulgarian converts to Islam were called Pomaks\r\n(see ch. 4).\r\n\r\nThe plight of the peasants grew worse. Agricultural production dropped\r\nas their exploitation continued. Although landowners were not persecuted\r\nto the same degree as the peasantry, they were frequently displaced from\r\nthe land. Turkish cattle breeders entered the country to settle on their\r\nlands. Lands were also taken to reward army commanders, provincial\r\ngovernors, and knights in the service of the sultan. Still other lands\r\nwere given to immigrant Turkish peasants. The only food that was not\r\nsubject to requisition by the conquerors was pork, which was not allowed\r\nin the Muslim diet.\r\n\r\nAs the life of the Bulgarian countryside declined, so too did urban\r\nlife. Bulgarians were expelled from most urban centers and replaced by\r\nGreeks, Armenians, Jews, and Turks. By the end of the sixteenth century\r\ntwo-thirds of Sofia's population was Turkish. Trade was virtually halted\r\nfor a time, and, when resumed, it also was dominated by Greeks,\r\nArmenians, and Jews rather than Bulgarians. The towns themselves were in\r\na state of deterioration. The crafts had declined, economic life was\r\nstagnant, and the Black Sea was closed to all foreign ships.\r\n\r\nAs life within Bulgaria declined, the Turks began to perceive the\r\ncountry as a springboard for further aggression against other\r\nterritories. Although Bulgarian hopes rose briefly when it appeared that\r\nthe Turks might be destroyed by their enemies, such hopes eventually\r\nwere dashed when the Turks emerged victorious throughout a period of two\r\ncenturies of conquest and aggression.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of Turkish domination, the Turks waged continuous war\r\nwith Albania, Bosnia, Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and what remained of\r\nthe Byzantine Empire. Bulgarian hopes of liberation were fueled by the\r\nTurkish defeat at the Battle of Ankara in 1402, when the Turkish army\r\nwas defeated by the Tatars. Resistance was eventually crushed, however,\r\nand the Turks began to renew their conquests after capturing Salonica in\r\n1430. In the Battle of Varna the Turks succeeded in capturing\r\nConstantinople itself.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Constantinople the Turks overran Serbia, Wallachia,\r\nBosnia, and Albania. Their conquests expanded to include Mesopotamia,\r\nSyria, Arabia, and North Africa. In the sixteenth century Turkish\r\nconquests continued under Suleiman the Magnificent, who succeeded in\r\ncapturing Serbia and Hungary in 1526. This triumphant expansion of the\r\nTurkish state caused Bulgarian dreams to be destroyed, although sporadic\r\nstruggling within the country continued intermittently.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF NATIONALISM\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the first seeds of real\r\nresistance to Turkish rule were planted in Bulgaria. On the foreign\r\nfront the Turks were constantly besieged by the Austrians and the\r\nRussians. By 1683 the Austrian army succeeded in liberating Hungary and\r\nTransylvania; they also were able to penetrate areas of Bulgaria and\r\nMacedonia. These victories over the Turks again sparked Bulgarian hopes.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the internal situation in Bulgaria continued to\r\nsignal the eventual decline of Turkish power and the rise of a Bulgarian\r\nnational spirit. Because of the increase in corruption and oppression by\r\nthe Turks, the Bulgarians began to rebel openly. In the 1590s, the\r\n1680s, and the 1730s significant local uprisings took place. Although\r\nthese rebellions were not successful, they gave rise to the _haiduk_\r\n(forest outlaw) movement, which continued to carry out acts of rebellion\r\nagainst the Turkish overlords. The people praised their acts of daring\r\nand wrote folk songs detailing their adventures and exploits. In\r\naddition to the revolutionaries the _chorbadzhi_ (squires), who were on\r\nthe whole a progressive force, were able to gain some concessions from\r\nthe Turks.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries this latent nationalism grew\r\nswiftly under the influence of outside forces penetrating the country.\r\nThe French Revolution--with its democratic ideals--had a widespread and\r\nvital impact on Bulgarian national sentiment. Western concepts and\r\nstandards penetrated the country mainly by means of trade, an activity\r\nthat Bulgarian traders realized could only be expanded when Turkish rule\r\nwas terminated. In addition Bulgarian students studying in foreign\r\nuniversities as well as Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries\r\nbrought back tales of Western life and ideals. At the same time,\r\ncurrents of Russian revolutionary thought, as well as contact with\r\nPolish refugees from the revolution of 1848, were sweeping Bulgaria. All\r\nthese factors coalesced and spurred the rising tide of nationalism\r\nwithin the country.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of the so-called Bulgarian National Revival, a\r\ncultural rebirth--which also stirred Bulgarian national sentiment--took\r\nplace on the national scene. In 1762 Father Paisi, a Macedonian monk,\r\nwrote a treatise called _The Slav-Bulgarian History_ that appealed to\r\nBulgarians to recognize their national culture and to fight for their\r\nown land and beliefs. Although the book was not published until after\r\nhis death, Father Paisi spread his credo by preaching his ideas in small\r\nvillages and towns. His message carried weight with many Bulgarians, and\r\nhis idealism promoted many to become politically active against their\r\nTurkish oppressors.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, during this period of growing Bulgarian nationalism,\r\nattempted to recoup their losses by effecting some moderate reforms.\r\nAlthough most of these acts came too late, they did succeed in enacting\r\nadministrative, social, and financial legislation that improved the lot\r\nof the Bulgarians. Native leaders were consulted by their Turkish\r\noverseers, and in one case a Bulgarian governor was appointed.\r\nProvincial assemblies began to meet on a regular basis, and by 1876 it\r\nwas determined by the Turks that some degree of self-rule should be\r\ngranted the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were by this period in an inevitable decline. Although Turkish\r\nrule extended over parts of three continents, the Turks continued to\r\nexpand their conquests. Military expenses became a staggering burden.\r\nThe Turkish economy was in an unfavorable position, and the Turks were\r\nbeginning to lose battles to increasingly well trained European armies.\r\nThe original Spartan life-style of the sultans and army officers was\r\nbecoming one of luxury and indulgence. All the signals for the fall of\r\nthe Turks were in evidence.\r\n\r\nAs the movement toward national revolution grew up in the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury in Bulgaria, an ideological schism separated the movement into\r\ntwo schools. The \"moderates,\" led by a Bulgarian group in\r\nConstantinople, favored negotiations with the Turks. The \"radicals\" felt\r\nthat such an approach would lead to inevitable failure. Although the\r\nradicals turned to the West--France, Great Britain, Italy, and\r\nSwitzerland--for models of revolution and to Russia for practical\r\nassistance in freeing Bulgaria from the Turks, in fact they hoped to\r\nfree the country from all foreign domination. Ironically, in light of\r\nBulgaria's later history, one radical leader wrote, \"If Russia comes to\r\nliberate, she will be met with great sympathy, but if she comes to rule,\r\nshe will find many enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the radicals were Georgi Rakovsky and Vasil Levski.\r\nRakovsky continued for twenty-five years to organize armed detachments\r\nalong the borders of neighboring countries. Levski, for his part,\r\nrealized that a social revolution as well as a national revolution was\r\nimperative for the true liberation of the Bulgarian people. He worked\r\nsub rosa in Bulgarian villages and organized a network of committees for\r\nthe revolution, known as the Internal Secret Revolutionary Organization.\r\nIn 1873 he was captured by the Turks and hanged.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1870s the seeds of revolution were sown as Bulgarians won\r\nsome political victories over their conquerors. In 1870, primarily\r\nbecause of the activity of the Bulgarian priests, the Bulgarian Orthodox\r\nChurch was reestablished. Although the Bulgarian clergy was in large\r\npart responsible for this action, it was probably tolerated by the Turks\r\nbecause of their anger with the Greeks, who were then embroiled in a\r\nrevolt in Crete. In 1872 the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee\r\nwas formed in Bucharest; by 1875 this group became active in the\r\nuprisings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, uprisings that were not easily\r\nquelled by the Turks.\r\n\r\nAs Bulgarian revolutionary sentiments grew, the Bulgarians turned to\r\nRussia to help win freedom from the Turks. Although the motives of the\r\nRussians and the Bulgarians were not identical, both wanted to rid the\r\nBalkans of Turkish oppression. The Russians perceived the Ottoman Empire\r\nas a very dangerous rival that they hoped to annihilate, thus gaining\r\ncontrol of Western European trade. The Bulgarians, although their\r\nmotives were also pragmatic, felt a deep sense of kinship with the\r\nRussian people. The Russians, like the Bulgarians, were Slavs. Their\r\nreligion was identical. Even their language was similar. Thus, they\r\nsensed a commonality not only of interests but also of cultures.\r\n\r\nThe precursor to the liberation in 1878 was an unsuccessful uprising in\r\n1876. The Bulgarians, at this point, were ill prepared for war,\r\npolitically and strategically. Thousands of Bulgarians were killed in\r\nApril of that year. Soon thereafter Turkish reprisals followed. Fifteen\r\nthousand Bulgarians were massacred in Plovdiv alone. The savagery of\r\nthese reprisals was so brutal that Western public leaders spoke out in\r\nprotest. The governments of the West, however, fearing an increased\r\nRussian penetration in the area, refused to act against the Turks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the revolution of 1876 had met with failure, it had succeeded\r\nin loosening the Turkish grip on the country and in increasing the\r\nfeeling of the Russians that the time to attack was imminent. Finally,\r\nafter the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Russians invaded Bulgaria,\r\nliquidating the Turkish army by March 1878. In these battles for\r\nBulgarian liberation, the Russians lost over 200,000 lives, a sacrifice\r\nthe Bulgarians never failed to recognize.\r\n\r\nThe results of 1878 were mixed, and the outcome of the original peace\r\ntreaty was reversed within five months of its signing. Bulgaria became\r\nan autonomous tributary of the Turkish sultan; complete independence was\r\nnot established until 1908. The original peace treaty, the Treaty of San\r\nStefano, signed on March 3, 1878, granted Bulgaria additional\r\nterritories, including Thrace and the much-valued Macedonia. This treaty\r\nwas reversed, primarily because of Western fear of Russian encroachment,\r\nby the Congress of Berlin; the Treaty of Berlin, signed on July 13,\r\n1878, unlike the Treaty of San Stefano, delimited Bulgarian territories.\r\nThe Bulgarians were forced to give Thrace and Macedonia back to the\r\nTurks. Bulgaria itself was carved into two separate entities: the\r\nprincipality of Bulgaria, including northern Bulgaria and Sofia, and\r\neastern Rumelia, or southern Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERATION AND ITS AFTERMATH\r\n\r\nAlthough the 1877-78 war freed Bulgaria from Turkish rule, the outcome\r\nof the Congress of Berlin once again denied to Bulgaria the land that it\r\nperceived to be rightfully Bulgarian, thus setting the tone for an\r\nirredentist foreign policy that lasted through World War II. Because the\r\nWest, particularly Great Britain, played a significant role in carving\r\nup the Balkans, and Bulgaria in particular, in hopes of curbing Russian\r\npower, many historians speculate that Bulgaria's alliances with Germany\r\nin both World War I and World War II were products of irredentist\r\nsentiment that grew out of the Treaty of Berlin.\r\n\r\nBulgaria moved to recapture its lost territory only seven years after\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin. In 1885 it annexed eastern Rumelia--or southern\r\nBulgaria--by means of a military coup. The British were in favor of the\r\nannexation as it represented an obstacle to Russian ambitions in the\r\nBalkans; the Russians quite naturally were disturbed by the act. This\r\nwas the first in a series of Bulgarian moves designed to reestablish\r\nearlier boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Bulgarian government in 1878 was relatively\r\neasily accomplished, and that government achieved a certain degree of\r\nstability in the aftermath of Turkish rule. The Turnovo Constitution\r\n(1879)--originally drafted by the Russians but rewritten by\r\nBulgarians--established an essentially advanced and democratic system.\r\nIt set up a unicameral parliament, which was to be elected on the basis\r\nof universal suffrage; the parliament was to control the executive. The\r\nmonarchy, which lasted from the 1880s until World War II, was\r\nestablished at this time under a Germany dynasty that was acceptable to\r\nthe European powers. Although the first prince was forced to abdicate by\r\nthe Russians, his successor established firm and advanced economic and\r\nadministrative institutions in the country. Eventually, because of a\r\ncrisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country was able to declare itself\r\nan independent kingdom in 1908.\r\n\r\nOne historian has described the postliberation period as the \"only\r\nprolonged period of peaceful development\" for Bulgaria. After the\r\nliberation, land rose in value. Peasants were able to purchase land from\r\nthe Turks, and agricultural production rose markedly. Modern industry\r\ngrew up at a relatively rapid pace, although the country remained\r\nprimarily agrarian. The state began to take steps in education and\r\nculture. All levels of education were expanded; students of higher\r\neducation studied both in Bulgaria and abroad; and illiteracy, which was\r\noverwhelming at the period of liberation, was reduced to 76 percent by\r\n1900 and to 54 percent by 1920. Science and the arts were actively\r\nencouraged, and literature flourished once again.\r\n\r\nFinancial burdens, however, escalated rapidly between 1886 and 1911. In\r\n1911 the national debt was actually more than three times the size of\r\nthe national budget. At the same time, as industry increased, two\r\nantagonistic groups developed: the urban middle class--composed of\r\nmerchants and white-collar workers--and the poor, who were generally\r\nlaborers or peasants. Working conditions in factories were nearly\r\nintolerable, causing factory workers to interest themselves in the cause\r\nof socialism, while on the farms the peasants began to organize a\r\nmovement known as the Bulgarian Agrarian Union (also called the Agrarian\r\nParty), which was designed to offset the growing power of the urban\r\ngroups. In 1891 the Social Democratic Party was established; this party\r\nlater formed the base of the communist party in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Macedonian Issue\r\n\r\nBy the early twentieth century the country was once again embroiled in\r\nwar; the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 impeded economic and social\r\ndevelopment in the country. Once again, as in the case of eastern\r\nRumelia, irredentism was the Bulgarian motive for war. Both eastern\r\nThrace and Macedonia, the lands ceded to Bulgaria by the Treaty of San\r\nStefano, were still under Turkish rule. The lands had not only large\r\nBulgarian populations but also strategic and economic significance.\r\nMacedonia, more than Thrace, was of extreme importance to Bulgaria;\r\nBulgarians believed the population of Macedonia to be composed almost\r\nexclusively of Bulgarians. The issue of Macedonia was, in fact, a focal\r\npoint around which Bulgarian political life revolved after 1878, because\r\nthat issue was seen by the Bulgarians as involving the territorial\r\nintegrity of their nation.\r\n\r\nBetween the tenth and fourteenth centuries Macedonia was alternately\r\noccupied by the Bulgarians, the Serbs, and the Turks. At the time of\r\nliberation Macedonia was ceded to the Bulgarians by the Treaty of San\r\nStefano, only to be returned to the Turks by the Treaty of Berlin. In\r\n1893 the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) was\r\nfounded. This terrorist organization, with the battle slogan \"Liberty or\r\nDeath for Macedonia,\" fought a continual underground war of terrorism\r\nagainst the Turks. In 1903 there was a major Macedonian uprising in\r\nwhich two factions participated. Although the predominant faction\r\nfavored Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia, another group favored\r\ncomplete autonomy for Macedonia. In 1908, when King Ferdinand proclaimed\r\nBulgaria completely independent, memories of the medieval Bulgarian\r\nempire, which included Macedonia, were rekindled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Balkan Wars\r\n\r\nThe tumultuous history of Macedonia set the stage for the two Balkan\r\nwars. In 1912, at the onset of the First Balkan War, Serbia, Bulgaria,\r\nMontenegro, and Greece formed an alliance to drive the Turks from\r\nEurope. Turkey, who was at war with Italy at the time, was weak and\r\ndisunited. Macedonia and Thrace were hotbeds of internal disorder. In\r\nOctober 1912 Turkey declared war on Serbia and Bulgaria, a move that was\r\ncountered by a Greek declaration of war on Turkey. In 1913 the\r\nBulgarians succeeded in capturing Adrianople, and the Greeks captured\r\nSalonica, Crete, and Samos. Eventually, the Turks were badly defeated.\r\nBut the question of Macedonia remained. Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria all\r\nlaid claim to the land at the end of the first Balkan War. Eventually a\r\ncompromise was reached: the northern section went to Serbia and the\r\neastern section, to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nDespite this compromise, the Serbs and Greeks remained wary of the\r\nBulgarians. In 1913 the Second Balkan War began, the Greeks,\r\nMontenegrins, Serbs, and Romanians joining forces with their previous\r\nenemy, the Turks, against their former ally, the Bulgarians. This\r\nrivalry had been fostered by both Austria and Russia. Eventually, the\r\nBulgarians turned to the Russians for arbitration and finally signed a\r\nmutual defense treaty with Russia. When the Romanians crossed into\r\nBulgaria, the Bulgarians--who were simultaneously fighting in Macedonia\r\nand were therefore weakened by fighting on two fronts--were forced to\r\nsurrender. As a result of this loss, when the peace treaty of Bucharest\r\nwas signed in August 1913 and Macedonia was partitioned between Greece\r\nand Serbia, Bulgaria managed to retain only a tiny fragment in the\r\neastern sector.\r\n\r\nMacedonia, however, remained an issue for Bulgaria. In World War I\r\nBulgaria succeeded in invading Macedonia. During the interwar period\r\nMacedonia was divided between Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia,\r\nYugoslavia retaining the largest portion of the land. In the 1923-34\r\nperiod Macedonian terrorism plagued the country and wreaked havoc on\r\nBulgarian political and social life. During World War II the Bulgarians\r\ninvaded both Greek Macedonia and Yugoslav Macedonia once again. Although\r\nthe Macedonians themselves were divided in their sentiments between\r\nloyalties to Greeks, Yugoslavs, and Bulgarians, the land eventually\r\nreverted to Yugoslavia during World War II. As an issue, however, it\r\nstill burns in the minds of the Bulgarians. The Macedonian question has\r\nbeen aptly referred to as \"that eternal Balkan sore spot of rival\r\nnationalism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD WAR I\r\n\r\nAs was the case in the Balkan wars, Bulgaria's primary motivation for\r\nengagement in World War I was irredentism. Again the country was\r\ndetermined to regain the two lands that had escaped her grasp in the\r\npast: Macedonia and Thrace. Although Macedonia was prized for political\r\nand social reasons, Thrace represented a strategically more significant\r\nobjective. In order to develop foreign trade, Bulgaria required an\r\noutlet to the sea; Thrace represented that outlet.\r\n\r\nThe domestic situation in the country before World War I was mixed.\r\nAlthough Bulgaria's army had been demobilized at the end of the Second\r\nBalkan War (1913) and economic conditions were rapidly improving, the\r\nmood of the monarchy and the middle class was one of vindictiveness and\r\nretaliation against those countries that had stripped Bulgaria of its\r\nterritories. The country became divided between those who wanted closer\r\nrelations with Russia and the Triple Entente and those who preferred an\r\nalliance with the Central Powers. As the war neared, the struggle\r\nbetween these camps intensified.\r\n\r\nBulgaria, of all the Balkan states, was the only one to join the Central\r\nPowers, led by Germany and Austria, in World War I. It was deeply ironic\r\nthat Bulgaria chose to side with her former enemy and oppressor, Turkey,\r\nand against her former friend and protector, Russia. Again, the issue\r\nfor Bulgaria was the Macedonian question. Serbia and Greece, which had\r\ntriumphed over Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War, were allied with the\r\nentente powers. Bulgaria chose to fight against these enemies in order\r\nto regain Macedonia. Although the entente powers hoped to woo Bulgaria\r\nto their side, they refused--because of Serb and Greek pressures--to\r\ncede Macedonia to Bulgaria. The Central Powers, on the other hand, who\r\nwere already at war with Serbia, were willing to promise Macedonia to\r\nthe Bulgarians in exchange for their collaboration.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the war Germany won victories in France and on\r\nthe eastern front. Although the government then ruling Bulgaria was\r\nalready inclined to join the Central Powers, these early successes made\r\nGerman promises even more appealing. In August 1915 a secret treaty of\r\nalliance was signed by Bulgaria and Germany, containing a clause that\r\npromised Serbian, Greek, and Romanian territories to the Bulgarians.\r\nThus the quadripartite alliance was born, composed of Germany,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nBy September 1915 Bulgarian troops were mobilized and began to deploy\r\nalong the borders of Greece and Serbia. On October 1, 1915, Bulgaria\r\ndeclared war on Serbia and, with the assistance of Austrian and German\r\ntroops, succeeded in defeating the Serbian army. At the same time the\r\nBulgarian army began to advance on Macedonia. There the local\r\npopulation, a proportion of which was openly sympathetic to Bulgarian\r\naspirations, joined in the fighting on the side of the Bulgarians.\r\nAlthough the Bulgarian army attempted to drive the entente forces from\r\nsouthern Macedonia, it met with failure. This defeat was followed by a\r\nperiod of prolonged trench warfare on the Balkan front. By 1916 Bulgaria\r\nwas also at war with Romania and, with the help of German and Austrian\r\nunits, managed a victory over the Romanians.\r\n\r\nWhile the war dragged on, the internal political situation was rapidly\r\ndeteriorating. The country was in a state of economic chaos, and the\r\nliving conditions of laborers and peasants continued to decline. Farm\r\nproduction dropped quickly, resulting in famine and soaring prices.\r\nThese dire conditions gave a strong impetus to the growing antiwar\r\nmovement in the country. The movement was headed by the left-wing\r\nSocialists, who attempted to correlate the antiwar movement with\r\nsocialist propaganda. The Russian Revolution of 1917 stirred some\r\nelements of the Bulgarian population who, like the Russian people, felt\r\nthat their government failed to represent their interests and was\r\nunresponsive to their needs. There were open revolts in the towns and\r\nvillages; underground activities were growing within the Bulgarian army\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBy 1918 Bulgaria and the Central Powers were defeated, leaving Bulgaria\r\nin a worse position than before the war. Hopes of regaining Thrace and\r\nMacedonia were dashed, and the country was immeasurably weakened by\r\nexternal fighting and internal division. The people were frustrated and\r\nbitter. Although the war had stimulated Bulgaria's industry--there were\r\n345 industrial enterprises in 1911 and 1,404 in 1924--it had been costly\r\nin other respects. Bulgaria was forced to pay both reparations and\r\npayments for the allied occupation that followed. Taxes rose, and the\r\nvalue of the currency declined. As a result, King Ferdinand was forced\r\nto abdicate in 1918, shortly before the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine was signed on November 27, 1919, ending\r\nBulgaria's role in the war and establishing her boundaries. Once more\r\nBulgaria had entered a war on the losing side, and once more its\r\nirredentist ambitions had resulted in no territorial gains. At the end\r\nof the war Bulgaria lost Thrace to Greece--thus failing in her attempts\r\nto gain access to the sea--and a small area in the Rodopi (or Rhodope\r\nMountains) and a portion of its western frontier to Yugoslavia. As a\r\nresult of these losses, Bulgaria was left with a still greater sense of\r\nfrustration and hostility toward its Balkan neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERWAR YEARS\r\n\r\nThe period between the first and second world wars was one of political\r\nunrest and Macedonian terrorism. The country was in an almost untenable\r\neconomic situation at the close of the war: prices skyrocketed, people\r\ndied of starvation, and strikes were almost continuous. Out of this\r\nsituation two extreme political groups grew up. On the extreme Right was\r\na faction of the IMRO, which at that time demanded the annexation of\r\nGreek and Yugoslav Macedonia. On the Left was the Bulgarian Agrarian\r\nUnion, the only party at the time more popular than the Communists.\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand was forced to abdicate, he was succeeded by his son,\r\nBoris III. Real political power was, however, in the hands of Alexander\r\nStambolisky, the leader of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union. He led the\r\ncountry as its prime minister from 1919 to 1923. When Stambolisky took\r\npower, the peasants formed 80 percent of the population. Stambolisky and\r\nthe Bulgarian Agrarian Union were dedicated to improving the lot of\r\nthese people; in his words \"to raising the standards both economic and\r\neducational, of the desperately poor and depressed peasant class.\"\r\n\r\nStambolisky, on behalf of the peasant populism movement, made several\r\nsweeping reforms. He instituted various social reforms, spread\r\neducation, and built roads. His strong dislike of the commercial and\r\nprofessional classes in the cities led him toward the objective of a\r\npeasant republic. When in power he instituted tax and land reforms and\r\nradically altered the legal system. His domestic policies were not\r\npopular with all strata of society; his foreign policies were even less\r\npopular. He favored reconciliation with Yugoslavia over the Macedonian\r\nissue. In 1923 he was overthrown by a group composed of IMRO, military,\r\nand other factions and was beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Stambolisky was followed by a communist attempt to foment\r\nrevolution in the country. The leaders were Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil\r\nKalarov, later leading figures in the Bulgarian communist state. The\r\ncountry was in a state of civil war, which was subsequently crushed by\r\nthe right-wing political factions of the country. Thousands of\r\nBulgarians were killed, and Dimitrov and Kalarov were exiled. In 1925\r\nthe Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary) was officially\r\noutlawed. Although Boris continued as monarch, the country was ruled by\r\ncoalition governments and military dictatorships for a decade following\r\nStambolisky's death.\r\n\r\nFrom 1923 until the putsch of 1934 IMRO terrorism dominated the country.\r\nBulgaria's position toward Macedonia was clear and unequivocal: it\r\nsought to annex Macedonia completely as it considered the land to be\r\nBulgarian and the people to be Bulgarians. In the Bulgarian sector of\r\nMacedonia the Macedonians were given a high degree of latitude, some\r\nMacedonians even holding high offices in Bulgaria. In the Yugoslavian\r\nsectors of Macedonia, however, most Macedonians felt oppressed and\r\nrestricted. As a result of this mixed status and treatment, there was a\r\ncertain ambivalence in Macedonian sentiment, the IMRO terrorists\r\nfavoring complete independence and self-rule. Among Macedonian patriots,\r\ntwo predominant factions grew up. The federalists favored an autonomous\r\nMacedonia--which could, if necessary, be allied with Yugoslavia and\r\nBulgaria--and the Supremists sought to incorporate Macedonia within\r\nBulgaria, with aspirations of dominating the entire Balkan area. The\r\nresults of these divergent opinions were expressed in acts of violence\r\nand terrorism that wreaked havoc in Bulgaria and eventually culminated\r\nin federalist collaboration with the Ustashi--a group of Croat\r\nseparatists--and the murder of King Alexander of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nMacedonian terrorism was virtually ended by the putsch of 1934. The\r\ngovernment, the People's Bloc, which was a coalition of four parties\r\nincluding the Bulgarian Agrarian Union was overthrown by the so-called\r\nZveno--or link--group. The Zveno group was headed by Kimon Georgiev and\r\nwas aided by the League of Reserve Officers. As soon as it seized power,\r\nZveno suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament. The king was\r\nleft with only nominal powers. Although the group did succeed for the\r\nmost part in ridding the country of Macedonian terrorism, its rule was\r\novertly authoritarian. By 1935 the king, with the aid of the military,\r\nhad regained his power and replaced the Zveno group with a more moderate\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWith the reestablishment of the monarchy, a royal dictatorship took\r\npower and ruled over Bulgaria until 1943, when Boris died. There were at\r\nthis time no forces left to oppose the king, political parties were\r\nnegligible, and only a shadow parliament existed. Ironically, the\r\nmilitary, which had aided the Zveno in the overthrow of the king, now\r\nwas an instrument of his control.\r\n\r\nForeign relations under Boris III before World War II were leading the\r\ncountry again inevitably into a war that would bring it to total defeat.\r\nIn 1934, despite the suppression of IMRO by the newly formed government,\r\nRomania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, as in the Second Balkan War,\r\nwere once again wary of Bulgaria's irredentist ambitions. In that year\r\nthe four powers signed the Balkan Pact, from which Bulgaria naturally\r\nwas excluded, in order to prevent Bulgarian encroachment in the area.\r\nAlthough Bulgaria and Yugoslavia later established a rapprochement in\r\n1937, the potential of a Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia was still\r\nconsidered a threat by its neighbors.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s, while Bulgaria was viewed with suspicion by its\r\nneighbors, it began to form new friendships with Germany and Italy.\r\nBoris had married the daughter of King Victor Emanuel of Italy, a\r\ncountry that had already become fascist, thus strengthening ties with\r\nthat country. At the same time, Bulgaria began to solidify its ties with\r\nGermany, principally by means of trade. A new-founded prosperity was\r\nbased almost exclusively on German trade, an arrangement that eventually\r\nweakened the country. Within a short period German agents were pouring\r\ninto the country. Thus, Bulgaria was on one side alienated from its\r\nneighbors and on the other being drawn into the nazi-fascist camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD WAR II\r\n\r\nBulgaria's motives for entering World War II were once again based on\r\nirredentism, coupled with almost total economic dependence on Germany.\r\nOnce more it hoped to regain the lands of Thrace and Macedonia, which\r\nwere lost after the Treaty of San Stefano was reversed by the Congress\r\nof Berlin. The lesson of the two subsequent Balkan wars and World War I\r\nhad fallen on deaf ears. Bulgaria was still estranged from its Balkan\r\nneighbors and once more was being courted by the former ally of World\r\nWar I, Germany. Germany, again realizing Bulgaria's territorial\r\naspirations, hoped to bribe the Bulgarian leadership with southern\r\nDobrudzha, which was eventually ceded to Bulgaria in 1940.\r\n\r\nIn December 1941 Bulgaria placed herself squarely on the German side by\r\ndeclaring war on Great Britain and the United States and joining the\r\nRome-Berlin Axis. This alignment, which derived primarily from\r\nBulgaria's irredentist policy, was given further force by dislike of the\r\nBritish, who were held to blame by the Bulgarians for the loss of\r\nMacedonia to Yugoslavia and Greece.\r\n\r\nDespite the declaration of war against Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, Bulgaria refused throughout World War II to declare war on the\r\nSoviet Union. The Russians, unlike the British and Americans, were\r\npopular with the Bulgarian people. They were still remembered for their\r\nassistance to the Bulgarians in the past and were viewed by the people\r\nas their liberators from Turkish rule. Not only did Bulgaria refuse to\r\ndeclare war on its former liberator, but it also refused to make its\r\narmy available to Adolf Hitler for his eastern campaign. When Germany\r\ndeclared war on Russia, Bulgaria continued to retain neutrality toward,\r\nand to maintain diplomatic relations with, the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the war, before Bulgaria had declared war on the\r\nAllies, it had already begun to regain some of the land lost during the\r\nBalkan wars and World War I. Southern Dobrudzha, which had been ceded to\r\nRomania in 1913, reverted to Bulgaria by August 1940. In the spring of\r\n1941, supporting Germany against Yugoslavia and Greece, Bulgaria\r\nregained Macedonia and part of Greek Thrace. When Bulgaria was rewarded\r\nwith these lands by the Nazis, Bulgarians perceived their gains as a\r\n\"historical national unification.\" By 1941 Yugoslavia was overrun, and\r\nsome of its territories were taken by Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria.\r\nItaly received Montenegro, Hungary took part of northern Yugoslavia, and\r\nBulgaria gained, in addition to the much-prized Macedonia, the frontiers\r\nof southeastern Serbia. The Bulgarians at this point were once again\r\napproaching the frontiers that had been established by the Treaty of San\r\nStefano.\r\n\r\nInternally, the country was in relatively good condition during the\r\nearly stages of the war. The economy, based primarily on active trade\r\nwith the Germans, was booming. The Bulgarian people perceived the\r\nfighting as essentially a \"paper war\" and were generally apathetic\r\nregarding their role in the war. There was little suffering within\r\nBulgarian boundaries and little expression of hatred toward Bulgaria's\r\nostensible enemies. Despite Bulgaria's alliance with the Nazis and\r\nFascists, within the country Jews were for the most part protected\r\nrather than persecuted.\r\n\r\nBy 1943, however, the war began to change for the Bulgarians. Slowly the\r\nAllies began to turn back German power. At this time Bulgaria was hit\r\nfrequently by British and United States air raids. Because of Bulgaria's\r\nstrategic significance and its declaration of war, albeit symbolic,\r\nagainst Great Britain and the United States, Sofia and other major\r\nBulgarian cities became targets for American and British bombers. Sofia\r\nwas reduced to little more than rubble at one point, and over 30,000\r\ncasualties were suffered by the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nIn 1943 Boris died and was succeeded by his six-year-old son, Simeon. In\r\nfact, however, a three-man regency retained power, with Ivan Bagrianov\r\nas premier. The regency was less actively pro-Axis in orientation than\r\nwas the late king; with its coming to power, thousands of political\r\nprisoners were released from jail, and all persecution of Jews was\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nBy 1944, when Germany and its allies were clearly losing the war, the\r\nBulgarian leaders sought to reverse the earlier decision of the king and\r\nto seek peace with the Allies as well as with the Greek and Yugoslav\r\ngovernments-in-exile. Despite sub rosa attempts to release itself from\r\nagreements with the Axis, Bulgaria was unable to extricate itself from\r\nthe alliance. On August 22, 1944, the Bulgarian government publicly\r\nannounced that it was ready for a peace agreement with the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe war was ended for Bulgaria when, on September 4, 1944, the Soviets,\r\nafter taking over Romania, entered Bulgaria. The exact sequence of\r\nevents has been interpreted differently by various historians. There are,\r\nhowever, two major interpretations. One suggests that, once the Soviets\r\nhad occupied Romania and declared war on Bulgaria, Bulgaria--under a\r\nhastily formed anti-Axis coalition government--immediately quit the pact\r\nwith the Axis and declared war on its former ally, Germany. The other\r\ninterpretation posits the theory that, on August 26, the Bulgarian\r\ngovernment had declared itself neutral, thus withdrawing from the war.\r\nAt this time it ordered German troops on its soil to disarm. When Soviet\r\ntroops arrived in Bulgaria, they found this so-called neutrality\r\nunacceptable and insisted on a Bulgarian declaration of war against\r\nGermany. This declaration was promptly carried out on the eve of the day\r\nthat it was requested.\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviets occupied the country in September 1944, the government\r\nof the so-called Fatherland Front (Otechestven Front) seized power from\r\nthe existing government within five days of the occupation. On September\r\n9, 1944, the Fatherland Front--under the leadership of Georgiev--officially\r\ntook control of the country on what was then termed an interim basis. On\r\nOctober 28, 1944, an armistice was signed between Bulgaria and the Soviet\r\nUnion, which stated that all territories gained by Bulgaria since 1941\r\nwould be surrendered. Only southern Dobrudzha, taken from Romania in 1940,\r\nwas to be retained. The agreement also established the Allied Control\r\nCommission in Sofia under direct Soviet control.\r\n\r\nThe results of the war for Bulgaria were mixed. In terms of financial\r\nburdens Bulgaria's position was relatively favorable compared with that\r\nof other countries on the losing side. In terms of territorial losses,\r\nwhich resulted in a legacy of bitterness and continued irredentism, its\r\nposition was poor. As Bulgaria had suffered over 30,000 casualties in\r\nthe war, the Allies imposed relatively light peace terms. The Soviet\r\nUnion extracted no reparations from Bulgaria, despite the fact that\r\nreparations were demanded from Germany, Hungary, and Romania. Yugoslavia\r\nalso canceled Bulgaria's debts. Overall war damages to the country\r\nitself were generally moderate.\r\n\r\nIn terms of losses, however, Bulgaria not only lost most of the\r\nterritories it had regained at the beginning of the war but also\r\nultimately lost its constitutional monarchy and became a Soviet\r\nsatellite. Although it was allowed to retain southern Dobrudzha, all the\r\nterritories that were of significance to Bulgaria's sense of nationhood\r\nwere gone. Macedonia reverted to Yugoslavia, and Thrace to Greece. The\r\nTreaty of Paris, signed in February 1947, confirmed Bulgaria's pre-1941\r\nboundaries. Not only had Bulgaria lost these prized territories, but her\r\nsovereignty as a nation was severely curtailed by the Soviet military\r\noccupation. Both the armistice agreement of September 1944 and the\r\nBritish-Soviet agreement of October of that year recognized Soviet\r\ndominance in the country. Although this power over the country was not\r\nexpected by the Western powers to endure indefinitely, this illusion was\r\ndispelled as Bulgaria soon succumbed completely to Soviet influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNIST STATE\r\n\r\nGrowth of the Communist Party\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Social Democratic Party was founded; the Communist party was\r\neventually an offshoot of this movement. By 1903 the Social Democrats\r\nhad begun to split into what were known as the \"broad\" and \"narrow\"\r\nfactions. The broad faction retained the ideology of social democracy,\r\nbut the narrow faction became the Bulgarian counterpart of the Russian\r\nBolsheviks; its leader was Dimiter Blagoev, the so-called father of\r\nBulgarian communism. In 1919 the narrow faction split off from the\r\nSecond Socialist International and assumed the name Bulgarian Communist\r\nParty (BKP). Although the party had great prestige abroad, it failed to\r\nenjoy domestic popularity. The most popular party at the time--and that\r\nfavored by the peasant class, which was predominant in this\r\nstill-agrarian society--was the Bulgarian Agrarian Union. The BKP, on\r\nthe other hand, was composed almost exclusively of intellectuals and\r\nstudents and held little appeal for the working and peasant classes.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Communists to bring the\r\ncountry to revolution. When this uprising was quelled, the Communists\r\nturned to terrorism in order to gain their goals, and in 1925 a plot to\r\nassassinate King Boris was formulated. Once again the Communists met\r\nwith failure, as the king not only lived but grew more powerful. In the\r\nlast half of the 1920s the party faded from the scene, but by the early\r\n1930s it was again revived and grew in popularity.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1930s the party went underground as the king increased\r\nhis power. In 1939 the Communists reappeared and merged with the\r\nleft-wing Workers Party; in the 1939 elections the party doubled its\r\nrepresentation and took on an air of greater respectability. In 1941,\r\nwhile the war was under way, the Communists realized that Bulgaria was\r\nfalling into the German camp. Although they were powerless to stop this\r\nalliance, their activity in evoking pro-Soviet sentiment was successful\r\nto the extent that--coupled with the basically favorable sentiments of\r\nthe Bulgarian people toward the Russians--it prevented the monarchy from\r\ndeclaring war against the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nOnce the Germans began to invade the Soviet Union itself, the Bulgarian\r\nCommunists committed themselves to a policy of armed resistance, known\r\nas the partisan movement. Historians dispute the extent of partisan\r\nactivity; some state that it did not become active until the Soviet\r\nvictory at Stalingrad in 1943, and others claim that the movement was\r\nactive from the onset of the German invasion of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1942, on the initiative of Dimitrov, the Fatherland Front was\r\nestablished. The organization was essentially a coalition, composed of\r\nmembers of the Workers Party, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union, the Social\r\nDemocratic Party and the BKP. Its purpose was to overthrow Boris and rid\r\nthe country of the Germans, simultaneously forming a new government that\r\ncould more adequately meet the needs of the workers and the peasants.\r\n\r\nIn 1943 the National Committee of the Fatherland Front was formed, and\r\nthis committee became the vehicle for the communist takeover in 1944. In\r\nthe same year the so-called National Liberation Army, composed of\r\npartisans and certain units of the Bulgarian army who had joined forces\r\nwith them, was established. In the fall of 1944 there were approximately\r\n18,000 people in the National Liberation Army, augmented by some 200,000\r\npeople who sheltered and assisted them.\r\n\r\nBefore 1944, however, the Communists were still not widely popular. The\r\napathy of a large portion of the population was due primarily to the\r\nfact that the country had remained relatively untouched by the war; but,\r\nas the country was not actually at war with the Soviet Union, little\r\nrationale was provided to the Soviet-backed Communists in their attempts\r\nto enlist the support of the partisans. The Bulgarian army and police\r\nwere active in hunting down the known Communists. All of these factors\r\nprecluded the possibility of the country becoming totally committed to\r\neither the communist cause or armed resistance. By 1944, however, when\r\nSoviet troops entered Romania, activity became widespread within\r\nBulgaria. In August 1944 Romania completely capitulated. By early\r\nSeptember the Soviet Union declared war on the Bulgarian government, an\r\nact more symbolic than real, as Soviet armies met no Bulgarian\r\nresistance. On September 9, 1944, the Fatherland Front was installed,\r\nand the Communists were firmly entrenched in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Since World War II\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Fatherland Front takeover in Bulgaria the Soviets,\r\nwith the assistance of the partisans and units of the National\r\nLiberation Army, occupied many Bulgarian towns and cities. It is said\r\nthat they were received by the people with gifts of bread and salt, a\r\ntraditional Bulgarian gift of welcome (see ch. 7). At the same time, on\r\nthe political front, the Soviets and their Bulgarian collaborators took\r\nover the key ministries in the capital city and arrested members of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Fatherland Front--a coalition composed at that time of Communists,\r\nmembers of the left wing of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union, members of the\r\nleft wing of the Social Democratic Party, and the Zveno group--was led\r\nby Georgiev as the new premier. Dimitrov and Kalarov returned from\r\nMoscow, where they had been in exile since 1925, to assist the new\r\ngovernment in its takeover. The Communists proceeded to rid the\r\ncoalition of certain opposing elements within its ranks. Nikolai Petkov\r\nof the Peasant Union and Kosta Lulchev of the Social Democratic Party\r\nwere temporarily retired from the coalition. Large-scale purges were\r\ninitiated against German collaborators and sympathizers; many thousands\r\nwere either executed or imprisoned by the Communists.\r\n\r\nWhen plans for elections were made in 1945, both Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States made a strong bid for the holding of popular elections.\r\nTheir hopes were temporarily defeated when, on November 18, 1945,\r\ncommunist-controlled elections were held. The Fatherland Front won a\r\ndecided victory, eventually resulting in Georgiev's formal installation\r\nas premier. His tenure in office was brief, and he was quickly succeeded\r\nby Dimitrov. At this point Great Britain and the United States\r\nprotested, insisting that the Communists broaden their governmental\r\nbase. Thus, although the two leading figures of the BKP, Dimitrov and\r\nKalarov, were installed eventually as premier and president,\r\nrespectively, Petkov and Lulchev were allowed to take over control of\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice, two vital\r\norgans of the government.\r\n\r\nBy 1946, however, the Communists had whittled down all opposition. In\r\nJuly 1946 control over the army had been transferred from noncommunist\r\nmembers of the ostensible coalition government to exclusively communist\r\ncontrol. At this time 2,000 so-called reactionary army officers were\r\ndismissed. A plebiscite held in September abolished the monarchy,\r\ndeclared Bulgaria a republic, and gave all power to Dimitrov as premier.\r\nHe officially took the title on November 4, 1946, and held it until his\r\ndeath in 1949. When Dimitrov took power, any opposition that remained\r\nwas quickly eliminated. Once the United States had ratified the\r\nBulgarian Peace Treaty--a moment for which the Communists waited\r\nanxiously in order to rid themselves of all Western control over\r\nBulgarian affairs of state--Petkov was summarily arrested and executed.\r\nHis party, the Peasant Union, had been dissolved one month before his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 1947, a new constitution was adopted. It was called,\r\nafter the premier, the Dimitrov Constitution and was modeled on the\r\nSoviet Constitution of 1936 (see ch. 8). One historian claims that, at\r\nits first drafting, it closely resembled the Turnovo Constitution of the\r\nlate 1800s but was later amended to parallel more closely the\r\nconstitution of the Soviet Union. The Dimitrov Constitution created the\r\nNational Assembly as a legislative body. In fact, however, laws were\r\nproposed by the Council of Ministers and passed pro forma by the\r\nNational Assembly. The constitution was approved by the National\r\nAssembly in 1947. It defined collective ownership of production, stated\r\nthat the regime held the power to nationalize any and all enterprises,\r\nand declared that private property was subject to restrictions and\r\nexpropriation by the state.\r\n\r\nBy 1948 the small forces that continued to oppose the Communists were\r\nfinally eliminated. Many opposition Socialists and their leader,\r\nLulchev, were arrested, and the Socialist Party was abolished. The only\r\nremaining Socialist party--the Fatherland Front Socialists--was forced\r\nto merge with the Communists in August 1948. Thus, absolute communist\r\ncontrol was achieved within four years of the seizure of power.\r\n\r\nBulgaria underwent a series of rapid changes in the early years as a\r\ncommunist state. Agricultural collectivization--initiated in 1946--was\r\nbegun in the form of cooperative farming. By the end of 1947\r\nnationalization of banks, industry, and mines was well under way.\r\nNationalization was not a new phenomenon for the country, as railroads,\r\nports, and mines had been under state control since 1878, but it was\r\ngreatly extended by the Communists (see ch. 13; ch. 14).\r\n\r\nReligion was viewed by the Communists as a means for manipulating and\r\nindoctrinating the people, much as it had been during the periods of\r\nByzantine and Turkish rule. Since its founding in the ninth century, the\r\nBulgarian Orthodox Church had claimed most of the population as members.\r\nThe Communists perceived a dual purpose in their cooptation of this\r\ninstitution. On the one hand, by patronizing the Bulgarian church, they\r\nbelieved that they would receive support from its members. On the other\r\nhand, they sought to unify the churches by placing the Bulgarian\r\nOrthodox Church under close control of the Russian Orthodox Church.\r\nTherefore, the regime reestablished the Bulgarian patriarchate; the\r\npatriarch, in turn, required all church members to support governmental\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nMinority religions were treated as separate entities, although all of\r\nthem had to register with the Committee for Religious Affairs, a body\r\nattached to the Council of Ministers. The leadership of all churches was\r\nconsidered responsible ultimately to the state. The churches became\r\nfinancially dependent upon the government as all church funds were in\r\nthe hands of the bureaucracy. A certain percentage of Muslims--who\r\nconstituted the largest minority religion--were expelled from the\r\ncountry. Those Muslims who remained were organized into small\r\ncommunities, and their religious leader, the grand mufti, was allowed to\r\nretain his position as long as he remained subservient to the state.\r\n\r\nAs far as other minority religions were concerned, their churches were,\r\nfor the most part, closed, and their leaders were either harassed or\r\nexecuted. Roman Catholic churches were closed, the church hierarchy was\r\nabolished, and in 1952 forty leading Catholics were tried and sentenced\r\nto death. The Protestants were allowed slightly more latitude. Although\r\nall Protestant schools were immediately closed, five Protestant\r\ndenominations were allowed to merge into the United Evangelical Church.\r\nIn 1949, however, fifteen Protestant pastors were executed. Some Jews\r\nwere allowed to emigrate to Israel in the early period of communist\r\nrule, but in Bulgaria the grand rabbi, like the Moslem grand mufti, was\r\nrendered completely subordinate to the state.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 Dimitrov died and was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Vulko\r\nChervenkov, known as the Stalin of Bulgaria, who controlled the\r\ngovernment from 1950 until 1956. His was a one-man rule, patterned\r\ncompletely on the rule of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. He was both\r\nthe premier and the First Secretary for the six years of his rule. There\r\nwas an increase in industrial production under Chervenkov. Production\r\nplans, however, appeared to be conceived more in the light of Soviet\r\nfive-year plans than with regard to Bulgaria's economic needs.\r\nAgriculture was almost completely collectivized, although production\r\ngoals were not achieved, and the standard of living declined appreciably\r\nunder Chervenkov's rule.\r\n\r\nIn foreign policy Bulgaria under Chervenkov continued to follow the\r\nSoviet example. International communism dominated all Bulgaria's foreign\r\npolicies. In the early 1950s Bulgaria supported the abortive communist\r\nuprising in Greece. Chervenkov attempted to rid the country of all\r\nWestern influence and severed diplomatic relations with the United\r\nStates in 1950. After Chervenkov's term relations were reestablished in\r\n1960 and promoted from legation to embassy status in 1966. Again,\r\nfollowing the example of the Soviet Union, which was then on strained\r\nterms with the nationalistic Yugoslavs, Chervenkov purged 100,000\r\nnationalists from the party and executed Traicho Kostov, the deputy\r\npremier, on the grounds that he was a Titoist. Because of Bulgaria's\r\nantisocial behavior in the world community, the country was excluded\r\nfrom the United Nations until 1955.\r\n\r\nAlthough Stalin died in 1953, Chervenkov retained his office as premier\r\nuntil 1956 but held only nominal powers. He was ultimately purged in\r\n1962. Chervenkov, in the post-Stalin period, was openly charged with\r\nsupporting the personality cult policies of Stalin. After Stalin's death\r\nthere was a degree of political relaxation under a policy known as the\r\nNew Course. Police terrorism abated, and there was greater freedom of\r\nmovement in the society as a whole. Travel abroad was tolerated to a\r\ngreater degree, and an increased interest in the welfare of the people\r\nwas manifested. The government actively courted the peasants in order to\r\nwin them over to its policy of collectivization. The working classes,\r\noffice workers, and even artisans were given more latitude by the\r\ngovernment. On the foreign front, following the example of Nikita\r\nKhrushchev, who sought reconciliation with Tito, and despite Bulgaria's\r\nreluctance over the still-fiery Macedonian issue, Bulgaria made some\r\nefforts at reconciliation with Yugoslavia. In order to establish better\r\nrelations both with the Yugoslavs and with the Bulgarian nationalists,\r\nKostov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 Chervenkov gave up his title as first secretary of the party,\r\nthus setting a new precedent for separation of party and state posts and\r\ndispelling the concept of one-man rule. Although Chervenkov retained his\r\ntitle as premier temporarily, Todor Zhivkov became the first secretary.\r\nShortly thereafter, Chervenkov was replaced as premier by Anton Yugov.\r\nAs Zhivkov, despite his backing by Khrushchev, was not firmly in control\r\nof the party, his takeover was followed by widespread purges.\r\n\r\nZhivkov's rule, like that of his predecessor, emulated the Soviet model.\r\nUnlike Chervenkov, however, Zhivkov based his government on the\r\nprinciple of collective leadership. In the early years of his rule he\r\nbased his foreign policy on allegiance to the Soviet Union. He strongly\r\nsupported the Soviets in their border conflicts with the People's\r\nRepublic of China (PRC). Bulgaria, despite basic sentiments concerning\r\nMacedonia, still attempted to renew its friendship with Yugoslavia,\r\nagain following the Khrushchev example.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Zhivkov purged the party of both Chervenkov and Yugov and made\r\nhimself premier as well as first secretary, thus reestablishing the\r\nprinciple of unity of rule (see ch. 9). At the same time, this move\r\nincreased Zhivkov's control over the party. Internal problems continued\r\nto plague the Zhivkov government. There were, in the 1960s, severe\r\nshortages of food, housing, and consumer goods.\r\n\r\nBulgaria's foreign policy under Zhivkov, however, continued on an even,\r\nstrongly Soviet, keel. Bulgaria's foreign policy has been assessed by\r\nsome observers as \"a carbon copy of Moscow's.\" Bulgaria was, and is,\r\nconsidered to be the most reliable partner of the Soviet Union in the\r\nBalkans. In contrast, Albania has supported the PRC, Romania has pressed\r\nits case for independence, and Yugoslavia has essentially followed a\r\nnationalistic policy.\r\n\r\nBulgaria's relations with Greece, which had been basically negative for\r\ntwenty years, became more positive in 1964 when trade, air traffic,\r\ncommunications, and tourist agreements were signed. Because of the issue\r\nof Macedonia, relations with Yugoslavia were, for the most part, cool,\r\nalthough Zhivkov attempted to improve them from time to time. Relations\r\nwith the United States remained cool but correct.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, shortly after Khrushchev's ouster in the Soviet Union, there\r\nwas an attempted coup against Zhivkov. The government tried in vain to\r\nsilence the story but, when pressed, stated that the conspirators in the\r\nplot were Maoists, alienated by Bulgaria's anti-PRC policies. As the\r\ncoup was attempted only five months after Khrushchev's removal from\r\noffice, Zhivkov--whose power had been based to a large extent on\r\nKhrushchev's support--was in a highly vulnerable position. For this\r\nreason many attributed the conspiracy to those opposed to Zhivkov's\r\ngovernment itself and particularly those opposed to its subservience to\r\nthe Soviet Union. The conspirators included Bulgarian Communists, army\r\nofficers, and World War II partisans. The discovery of this plot\r\nresulted in purges, the suicide of one of the leading conspirators, and\r\nthe reorganization of the Ministry of the Interior and the transfer of\r\nits security functions to the new Committee of State Security, which\r\nfell directly under Zhivkov's personal control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND POPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBulgaria occupies 42,800 square miles of the Balkan Peninsula, and its\r\n1973 population was estimated at 8.7 million (see fig. 1). It is a\r\nmember of the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact), together with\r\nfive other Eastern European countries to its north and northwest and the\r\nSoviet Union. Bulgaria's location is such that its natural features are\r\ncombinations of those found in the western Soviet Union and in southern\r\nEurope. Its climate is transitional between that of the Mediterranean\r\ncountries and that of north-central Europe. The blend of the various\r\ngeographic influences is unique, however, and gives the country a degree\r\nof individuality that is not anticipated until it is explored in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIt is a land of unusual scenic beauty, having picturesque mountains,\r\nwooded hills, beautiful valleys, grain-producing plains, and a seacoast\r\nthat has both rocky cliffs and long sandy beaches. Soil and climate are\r\nadequate to permit production of a variety of crops. Although only a few\r\nmineral resources are present in quantity or in good quality ores, the\r\ncountry has a number of them. Large quantities of brown coal and lignite\r\nare available, but resources of the better fuels are limited.\r\n\r\nThe people of the country have been influenced by its location, which is\r\nclose to the point of contact between Europe and the Orient. The area\r\nhad been overrun by so many conquerors and occupied for so long that\r\nonly since liberation in 1878 have a majority of the peasants dared come\r\nout of the hills to farm the better land of the plains and valleys.\r\n\r\nThe country fared poorly in the distribution of the spoils after the\r\nFirst Balkan War in 1912. It was then on the losing side of the Second\r\nBalkan War in 1913 and of the two great wars since. In spite of this,\r\nits boundaries contain most of the Bulgarian people in the area, and\r\nonly some 10 to 15 percent of the population within its borders is not\r\nethnically Bulgarian. It has until recently been predominantly\r\nagricultural. Industrialization was undertaken late, and it was not\r\nuntil 1969 that the urban population equaled that of the rural areas\r\n(see ch. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nTopography\r\n\r\nAlternating bands of high and low terrain extend generally east to west\r\nacross the country. The four most prominent of these from north to\r\nsouth are the Danubian plateau, the Stara Planina (Old Mountain), or\r\nBalkan Mountains, the central Thracian Plain, and the Rodopi (or Rhodope\r\nMountains). The western part of the country, however, consists almost\r\nentirely of higher land, and the individual mountain ranges in the east\r\ntend to taper into hills and gentle uplands as they approach the Black\r\nSea (see fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe Danubian plateau, also called a plain or a tableland, extends from\r\nthe Yugoslav border to the Black Sea. It encompasses the area between\r\nthe Danube River, which forms most of the country's northern border, and\r\nthe Stara Planina to the south. The plateau rises from cliffs along the\r\nriver, which are typically 300 to 600 feet high, and abuts against the\r\nmountains at elevations on the order of 1,200 to 1,500 feet. The region\r\nslopes gently but perceptibly from the river southward to the mountains.\r\nThe western portion is lower and more dissected; in the east it becomes\r\nregular but somewhat higher, better resembling a plateau. Bulgarians\r\nname local areas within it, but they do not name the region as a whole.\r\nIt is a fertile area with undulating hills and is the granary of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe southern edge of the Danubian plateau blends into the foothills of\r\nthe Stara Planina, the Bulgarian extension of the Carpathian Mountains.\r\nThe Carpathians resemble a reversed S as they run eastward from\r\nCzechoslovakia across the northern portion of Romania, swinging\r\nsouthward to the middle of that country, where they run westward and\r\ncross Romania as the Transylvanian Alps. At a famous gorge of the Danube\r\nRiver known as the Iron Gate, which forms part of the Romania-Yugoslavia\r\nborder, the Carpathians again sweep eastward, becoming Bulgaria's Stara\r\nPlanina range.\r\n\r\nConsidered in its local context, the Stara Planina originates at the\r\nTimok Valley in Yugoslavia, continues southeastward as it becomes the\r\nnorthern boundary of the Sofia Basin, and then turns more directly\r\neastward to terminate at Cape Emine on the Black Sea. It is some 370\r\nmiles in length, and some twelve to thirty miles in width. It retains\r\nits height well into the central part of the country, where Botev Peak,\r\nits highest point, rises to about 7,800 feet. The range is still\r\napparent until its rocky cliffs fall into the Black Sea. Over most of\r\nits length, its ridge is the divide between drainage to the Danube River\r\nand to the Aegean Sea. In the east small areas drain directly to the\r\nBlack Sea.\r\n\r\nSometimes considered a part of the foothills of the Stara Planina, but\r\nseparated from the main range by a long geological trench that contains\r\nthe Valley of Roses, is the Sredna Gora (Middle Forest). The Sredna Gora\r\nis a ridge running almost precisely east to west, about 100 miles long.\r\nIts elevations run to only a little more than 5,000 feet, but it is\r\nnarrow and achieves an impression of greater height.\r\n\r\nThe southern slopes of the Stara Planina and the Sredna Gora give way to\r\nthe Thracian Plain. The plain is roughly triangular in shape,\r\noriginating at a point east of the mountains that ring the Sofia Basin\r\nand broadening as it proceeds eastward to the Black Sea. It\r\nencompasses the Maritsa River basin and the lowlands that extend from it\r\nto the Black Sea. As is the case with the Danubian plateau, a great deal\r\nof this area is not a plain in strict terms. Most of its terrain is\r\nmoderate enough to allow cultivation, but there are variations greater\r\nthan those of a typical plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2. Topography of Bulgaria_]\r\n\r\nThe Rodopi occupies the area between the Thracian Plain and the Greek\r\nborder. This range is commonly described as including the Rila mountain\r\nrange south of Sophia and the Pirin range in the southwestern corner of\r\nthe country. As such, the Rodopi is the most outstanding topographic\r\nfeature, not only of the country, but also of the entire Balkan\r\nPeninsula. The Rila contains Mount Musala--called Mount Stalin for a few\r\nyears--whose 9,500-foot peak is the highest in the Balkans. About a\r\ndozen other peaks in the Rila are over 9,000 feet. They feature a few\r\nbare rocks and remote lakes above the tree line, but the lower peaks are\r\ncovered with Alpine meadows, and the general aspect of the range is one\r\nof green beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Vitosha range is an outlier of the Rila. A symmetrical, 7,500-foot\r\nhigh, isolated peak in the range is a landmark on the outskirts of\r\nSofia. Snow covers its conical summit most of the year, and its steep\r\nsides are forested.\r\n\r\nThe Pirin is characterized by rocky peaks and stony slopes. An\r\nimpression of the landscape is provided by a local legend, which says\r\nthat when the earth was being created God was flying over the peninsula\r\nwith a bag of huge boulders. The rocks were too heavy for the bag, and\r\nit broke over southwestern Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nSome Bulgarian geographers refer to the western Rodopi and the Pirin as\r\nthe Thracian-Macedonian massif. In this context, the Rodopi includes\r\nonly the mountains south of the Maritsa River basin. There is some basis\r\nfor such a division. The Rila is largely volcanic in origin. The Pirin\r\nwas formed at a different time by fracturing of the earth's crust. The\r\nuplands east of the Maritsa River are not of the same stature as the\r\nmajor ranges.\r\n\r\nSizable areas in the western and central Stara Planina and smaller areas\r\nin the Pirin and in Dobrudzha have extensive layers of limestone. There\r\nare some 2,000 caves in these deposits. The public has become more\r\ninterested in the caves during the past three or four decades, but only\r\nabout 400 of them have been completely explored and charted.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the higher Rodopi and east of the Maritsa River are the\r\nSakar and Strandzha mountains. They extend the length of the Rodopi\r\nalong the Turkish border to the Black Sea but are themselves\r\ncomparatively insignificant. At one point they have a spot elevation of\r\nabout 2,800 feet, but they rarely exceed 1,500 feet elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFormation of the Balkan landmasses involved a number of earth crust\r\nfoldings and volcanic actions that either dammed rivers or forced them\r\ninto new courses. The flat basins that occur throughout the country\r\nwere created when river waters receded from the temporary lakes that\r\nexisted while the rivers were cutting their new channels. The largest of\r\nthese is the Sofia Basin, which includes the city and the area about\r\nfifteen miles wide and sixty miles long to its northwest and southeast.\r\nOther valleys between the Stara Planina and the Sredna Gora ranges\r\ncontain a series of smaller basins, and similar ones occur at intervals\r\nin the valleys of a number of the larger rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrainage\r\n\r\nFrom a drainage standpoint, the country is divided into two nearly equal\r\nparts. The slightly larger one drains to the Black Sea, the other to the\r\nAegean. The northern watershed of the Stara Planina, all of the Danubian\r\nplateau, and the thirty to fifty miles inland from the coastline drain\r\nto the Black Sea. The Thracian Plain and most of the higher lands of the\r\nsouth and southwest drain to the Aegean Sea. Although only the Danube is\r\nnavigable, many of the other rivers and streams have a high potential\r\nfor the production of hydroelectric power and are sources of irrigation\r\nwater. Many are already being exploited.\r\n\r\nInsignificant when compared with the watersheds that drain to the seas,\r\nabout 125 square miles of the country drain into a few small salt lakes\r\nthat have no outflowing water. The largest such lake has a surface area\r\nof 2.5 square miles.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the country that drains to the Black Sea does\r\nso through the Danube. Most of its major tributaries in the country\r\n(from west to east, the Ogosta, Iskur, Vit, Osum, Yantra, and Lom) carry\r\nmore water than do the combination of the Provadiyska, Kamchiya,\r\nFakiyska, and Veleka rivers, all of which flow directly into the Black\r\nSea. Of the Danube's Bulgarian tributaries, all but the Iskur rise in\r\nthe Stara Planina. The Iskur rises in the Rila and flows northward\r\nthrough a narrow basin. Territory not far from the river on both sides\r\nof it drains in the opposite direction, to the south. The Iskur passes\r\nthrough Sofia's eastern suburbs and cuts a valley through the Stara\r\nPlanina on its way to join the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe Iskur and the other of the Danube's north-flowing tributaries have\r\ncut deep valleys through the Danubian plateau. The eastern banks tend to\r\nrise sharply from the rivers; the western parts of the valleys may have\r\nbroad fields with alluvial soils. The peculiar, though consistent,\r\npattern is caused by forces resulting from the earth's rotation; these\r\nforces give the water a motion that tends to undercut the right banks of\r\nthe streams. Some of these rivers are sizable streams, but the Danube\r\ngets only a little more than 4 percent of its total volume from its\r\nBulgarian tributaries. As it flows along the northern border, the Danube\r\naverages one to 1.5 miles in width. Its highest water levels are usually\r\nreached during June floods, and in normal seasons it is frozen over for\r\nabout forty days.\r\n\r\nSeveral major rivers flow directly to the Aegean Sea, although the\r\nMaritsa with its tributaries is by far the largest. The Maritsa drains\r\nall of the western Thracian Plain, all of the Sredna Gora, the southern\r\nslopes of the Stara Planina, and the northern slopes of the eastern\r\nRodopi. Other than the Maritsa, the Struma in the west and the Mesta\r\n(which separates the Pirin from the main Rodopi ranges) are the two\r\nlargest of the rivers that rise in Bulgaria and flow to the Aegean. Most\r\nof these streams fall swiftly from the mountains and have cut deep,\r\nscenic gorges. The Struma and Mesta reach the sea through Greece. The\r\nMaritsa forms most of the Greek-Turkish border after it leaves Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAbout 3,750 square miles of agricultural land have access to irrigation\r\nwaters. Dams provide the water for about one-half of the acreage;\r\ndiversions from rivers and streams serve about one-third; and water\r\npumped from the ground and from streams accounts for the remainder.\r\n\r\nOf the dams, ninety-two are termed large state dams. Their combined\r\ncapacity is three times that of some 2,000 smaller dams. The sources of\r\nfour large rivers--the Maritsa, Iskur, Mesta, and Rilska (a major\r\ntributary of the Struma)--are within a few miles of each other in the\r\nhigh Rila. Water from the upper courses of these and several other\r\nstreams supplies the Sofia area with both water and electricity, and\r\nthey have a potential for further development. There are major dams on\r\nthe Tundzha, Iskur, Rositsa, and Struma rivers. The Danube is too\r\nmassive a stream to harness, and damming the Maritsa along most of its\r\ncourse would flood too much valuable land. The rivers flowing north\r\nacross the Danubian plateau also tend to be overly difficult to use in\r\nthe areas where they are most needed.\r\n\r\nThe Vucha River, flowing from the Rodopi into the Maritsa River, is\r\noften used to illustrate how rivers have been effectively harnessed to\r\nprovide a variety of benefits. Its cascade system of hydroelectric\r\ndevelopment employs six dams having the capacity to generate over\r\n600,000 kilowatts of electricity. The water they back up serves the\r\nmunicipal water systems in Plovdiv and a number of other towns in its\r\nvicinity, and the dams provide irrigation water for nearly 250,000 acres\r\nof cropland. The reservoirs themselves are being developed as\r\nrecreational areas and mountain resorts.\r\n\r\nWhere a stream is difficult to dam or to divert, water is pumped from\r\nit. This has been feasible only since about 1950, when low-cost diesel\r\nengines and sufficient hydroelectric power became available from newly\r\nconstructed dams on other streams. About eighty-five huge pumping\r\nstations have been set up along the Danube River, which furnishes about\r\nthree-quarters of the water acquired by this method; and in 1970 there\r\nwere about 1,200 lesser stations operating on smaller streams, most of\r\nthem on the Thracian Plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate\r\n\r\nFor so small an area, the climate varies widely and is unusually\r\ncomplex. Depending upon the depth to which they study the area,\r\nclimatologists list six or more climatic subzones. The country lies on\r\nthe line of transition between the strongly contrasting Eastern European\r\ncontinental and the Mediterranean climatic zones, and its mountains and\r\nvalleys are local factors that act as barriers or channels to the air\r\nmasses, contributing to sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short\r\ndistances. The Black Sea, although too small to be a primary influence\r\nover much of the country's weather, also affects the immediate area\r\nalong its coastline.\r\n\r\nIn general, continental systems prevail in the north. They are\r\ncharacterized by hot summers, cold winters, and precipitation well\r\ndistributed throughout the year, a major portion of it in early summer\r\nthunderstorms. The Mediterranean climate that is influential most of the\r\ntime in the south has mild, damp winters but hot, dry, rain-free\r\nsummers. The Stara Planina marks the lower limits of the area in which\r\ncontinental air masses circulate freely in typical circumstances. In the\r\narea between them and the Danube River there is an extension of the\r\nclimate that is common to east-central Europe and adjoining regions of\r\nthe Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn the same fashion, the Rodopi marks the northern limits of domination\r\nby Mediterranean weather systems. The southern slopes of these mountains\r\nare sufficiently mild to merit the region's being called the Green\r\nGreece or Bulgarian California.\r\n\r\nThe area in between, which includes the Thracian Plain, is influenced by\r\nboth types of climate, but more of the time by continental systems. The\r\nresult is a plains climate resembling that of the corn belt in the\r\nUnited States, which is characterized by long summers and high humidity.\r\nThe climate is generally more severe than that of Spain and the portions\r\nof Italy, France, and Soviet Georgia that are in the same latitude.\r\nBecause it is a transitional area and the Mediterranean systems may\r\nprevail for most of some seasons or retreat from the scene altogether in\r\nother seasons, average temperatures and precipitation are erratic and\r\nmay vary widely from year to year.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation over the country averages about twenty-five inches a year\r\nand, when it is distributed normally throughout the seasons, it is\r\nsatisfactory for most agricultural crops. Dobrudzha, in the northeast,\r\nthe Black Sea coastal area, and parts of the Thracian Plain usually\r\nreceive less than twenty inches. The remainder of the Thracian Plain and\r\nthe Danubian plateau get less than the country average. Higher\r\nelevations are the most generously watered, in some places receiving\r\nforty inches or more.\r\n\r\nAlthough a low figure of 7.6 inches was recorded in Dobrudzha for one\r\nyear and the normal precipitation is marginal, both Dobrudzha and the\r\nDanubian plateau are in the continental climate zone and usually receive\r\nmost of their rainfall during crop-growing seasons. The Thracian Plain,\r\nhowever, has frequent seasons when it is under Mediterranean influences\r\nand, when this is the case, it may experience prolonged summer droughts.\r\nIrrigation is, therefore, necessary for dependable agricultural\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nA few sheltered pockets in the higher mountains may remain covered with\r\nsnow all year, and much of the other higher land remains white well into\r\nspringtime. Lower elevations are snow covered an average of twenty-five\r\nto thirty days a year. Average cloudiness is about 55 percent, and\r\naverage relative humidity is as high as 70 to 75 percent.\r\n\r\nThe many valley basins throughout the uplands frequently have\r\ntemperature inversions resulting in stagnant air. The Sofia area, for\r\nexample, is occasionally troubled by smog. The city's elevation of about\r\n1,800 feet, however, tends to moderate summer temperatures and to\r\nrelieve the oppressive quality of the high humidity. It is also\r\nsheltered from the northern European winds by the mountains that ring\r\nthe basin. Its temperatures in January average about 29°F, and in August\r\nthey average about 70°F. Its rainfall is near the country average, and\r\nthe overall result of the several contributing features is a rather\r\nunexpectedly pleasant climate.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the coast is moderated by the Black Sea, but there are\r\nmany windy days and violent local storms during the winter. The area\r\nalong the Danube River experiences bitterly cold winters, and sheltered\r\nvalleys opening to the south along the Greek and Turkish borders may, in\r\ncontrast, be as mild as though they were on the Mediterranean or Aegean\r\ncoasts. The so-called Black Wind, a local phenomenon similar to the\r\nAfrican sirocco, consists of hard-blowing, hot, very dry air and wreaks\r\nhavoc on crops. It gets its name from the quantities of dust it carries,\r\nwhich often darken the skies.\r\n\r\nRegions in the Rodopi and the higher elevations around Sofia feature sun\r\nand snow in a pleasant combination for about four months a year. Several\r\nplaces have good and reasonably dependable skiing and are being\r\ndeveloped into holiday resorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoils\r\n\r\nFine, dark chernozem (black earth) soils, rich in loess and humus, occur\r\nover a considerable portion of the northern Danubian plateau. They are\r\nfertile, easy to work, and compare with the best soils in Europe. Away\r\nfrom the river, approaching the mountains, there is a broader area that\r\nis basically similar, but the subsoils are more porous and have allowed\r\nthe humus and loess to leach downward from the surface. The resulting\r\ngray soil no longer rates among the finest, but it yields good crops in\r\nsome areas and, where it is less satisfactory, the land is forested.\r\n\r\nThe Thracian Plain has comparatively little of the finest soils, but it\r\nhas much soil that is more than adequate to produce reasonably good\r\ncrops. The best on the plain is locally called _smolnitsa_. It is\r\nbasically a chernozem, but it is less fully matured and coarser than the\r\ndarker variety along the Danube. The plain also features fairly\r\nextensive areas of good brown and brown forest soils. Meadow soils occur\r\nin large areas in the vicinity of Plovdiv. Some are irrigated and\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nMeadow and layered podzol (gray forest) soils occur in most of the\r\nhigher elevations throughout the country. Intermediate elevations\r\nusually have brown forest soils, some of which are excellent. The\r\nMaritsa and Tundzha and the major rivers that flow into the Danube have\r\nwide valleys with alluvial soils. They may be coarse, but most of them\r\nare fertile, drain well, and are extensively cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetation\r\n\r\nBoth the natural vegetation and the cultivated crops that have replaced\r\nit on all areas that could be put to agricultural use reflect the\r\ntransitional climate of the country. North of the Stara Planina the\r\noriginal flora was a continuation of that on the Russian steppe. The\r\nsteppe influence was greatest in the east, giving way to deciduous\r\nforests farther to the west.\r\n\r\nLands south of the mountains, sheltered from the colder extremes of the\r\ncontinental weather systems, have been able to support plant life that\r\ncould not exist on the steppe. Areas along the Black Sea coast and in\r\nvalleys of the Rodopi that open to the south experience further\r\nmoderation. Many Mediterranean and subtropical species have existed in\r\nthem naturally, and others introduced by man have thrived.\r\n\r\nWhat remains of the original vegetation on the Danubian plateau is found\r\nmainly along the river, where the land has been difficult to cultivate.\r\nIt includes brush grass, reeds, and licorice. The last two have\r\ncommercial value. Most of the original lowland deciduous forests have\r\nbeen removed, and grain flourishes on the level expanses where the soils\r\nare favorable. Other food and fodder crops are grown to satisfy local\r\nrequirements. The foothills of the Stara Planina are dotted with\r\norchards; plums are the most prevalent fruit in these northern areas.\r\n\r\nThe depression, or geological trench, between the Stara Planina and the\r\nSredna Gora ranges, which is at the near center point of the country and\r\ncontains the upper valleys of the Tundzha, Stryama, and Topolnitsa\r\nrivers, is sheltered and very humid and is ideal for the raising of\r\nroses. One in particular, Rosa Alba, has become known as Bulgaria's\r\ngold. Its flower is not an especially lovely variety, but it is\r\nextremely rich in the rose oil that is the basic fragrance in many\r\nperfumes and a flavor in certain liqueurs. Fields of them flourish in\r\nthe Kazanluk area, the so-called Valley of Roses.\r\n\r\nThe Thracian Plain, between the Sredna Gora and the Rodopi, originally\r\nfeatured a mixture of midlatitude forest and Mediterranean flora. The\r\nforests have been removed from the level lands and have been replaced by\r\na diversification of crops, including truck vegetables, fruit orchards,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, vineyards, tobacco, and cotton. The plain\r\nalso produces a variety of herbs and medicine derivatives. Digitalis is\r\nproduced from foxgloves; menthol, from peppermint; opium, from a species\r\nof poppy; linseed oil, from flaxseed; laxatives, from iris and rhubarb;\r\nand castor oil, from the castor bean. All of them are grown on this\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nWhere the plain touches the Black Sea, varieties of tropical or\r\nsubtropical vegetation appear. Vegetation is dense along the Kamchiya\r\nRiver and on the banks of a few of the smaller streams as they approach\r\nthe sea. Reeds, lianas, exotic flowers, and huge old trees that grow\r\nnowhere else in the country flourish in this region.\r\n\r\nIn the southern Rodopi, where a few of the river valleys--those of the\r\nStruma, Mesta, and Maritsa, for example--open to the south, the\r\nvegetation is typically Mediterranean. Natural species include the\r\nMediterranean scrubby underbrush, maquis, and an assortment of flowering\r\nplants and shrubs. Vineyards and subtropical fruit grow well in these\r\nvalleys. Such areas produce the country's peaches, figs, and peanuts.\r\n\r\nMountainous regions feature Alpine meadows and pastures above the tree\r\nline, where the terrain permits, and conifer forests immediately below\r\nthe tree line. Deciduous trees are native to all of the uplands of the\r\ncountry with tolerable elevations. Beech predominates at intermediate\r\nelevations, particularly on northern slopes, and oak, on the lower\r\nfoothills. There are dense elm, oak, and ash forests at lower elevations\r\nin the Kamchiya River valley where it descends from the eastern part of\r\nthe Stara Planina. Scrub and brush prevail at all upland elevations\r\nwhere terrain and soil conditions are poor or where the original forest\r\nhas been removed and has not been replaced.\r\n\r\nThe Stara Planina has grassy meadowland and pastures on rounded summits\r\nand higher slopes. In the springtime these higher lands may also be\r\nbrilliant with wild flowers and flowering shrubs. Cherry laurel, for\r\nexample, grows wild over wide areas. The meadows usually give way to\r\nbeech and to other mixed deciduous forests at lower elevations. Mixed\r\nforests may contain varieties of oak, chestnut, hornbeam, elm, and ash.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable forests are in the Rodopi, although many of them are\r\ninterspersed among inaccessible craggy hills. A majority of the\r\ncountry's conifers, both the natural forest and those that have been\r\nplanted in preference to the slower growing deciduous, are in the higher\r\nRodopi, including the Rila and the Pirin. The most common of the\r\nconifers are pine and fir. At elevations beneath those dominated by the\r\nconifers, the mixture of broad-leaved deciduous trees is similar to that\r\nof the Stara Planina. Of the forest area, only about one-half has tall\r\ntimber. Scrub on the remainder, however, serves to stabilize the soil of\r\nthe forest lands against erosion and to slow the runoff of water. The\r\nrare and exotic edelweiss can be found on the higher slopes of the\r\nPirin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWildlife\r\n\r\nThe clearing of forestland and the increase in human population have\r\ndriven most of the larger wildlife from their natural habitats, except\r\nin the higher and more rugged terrain. Of the larger species, some\r\nbears, wild boars, wild goats, wolves, elk, and several species of deer\r\ncontinue to exist naturally. Foxes, wildcats, polecats, squirrels and\r\nother rodents, and hare--better able to adjust to existing\r\nconditions--are also surviving.\r\n\r\nQuail, turtledoves, wild fowl, and other game birds are hunted in\r\nrestricted seasons. Hunting seasons are also provided for some of the\r\ndeer species; the seasons usually last between two and four months,\r\ndepending upon the need to protect the animal, between the months of\r\nAugust and February. There are bounties on wolves and foxes. Wildcats,\r\nfalcons, and hawks are also considered harmful and may be killed at any\r\ntime. The polecat--in Europe the _Mustela putorius_, a fetid-smelling\r\nmember of the weasel and otter family--is a bloodthirsty, insatiable\r\nhunter that terrorizes poultry. It also may be exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe many caves in limestone-dominated regions have given rise to various\r\ntypes of blind fauna. The largest of them are crabs, but most are\r\ninsects, including mosquitoes, butterflies, spiders, locusts, and common\r\nflies. Although they are blind, exposure to light is usually fatal to\r\nsuch species.\r\n\r\nRivers contain several kinds of freshwater fish, the most plentiful of\r\nwhich are sturgeon, whitefish, and European carp. Mackerel account for\r\nthe largest percentage of fish taken from the Black Sea. There are no\r\nsharks or other dangerous fish in these waters, but a rare Black Sea\r\nseal breeds along the rocky coast north of Varna.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral Resources\r\n\r\nThe country's mountains contain a variety of metallic and nonmetallic\r\nminerals. A few are of good quality, but most of these occur in very\r\nsmall quantities. Iron and coal, which are basic to a metallurgical\r\nindustry, are mined, but neither of them is of the proper variety or\r\nquality nor are they available in adequate quantities to be used\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nLargest deposits of iron ore occur in the far western Stara Planina and\r\nthe Strandzha mountain range. There are smaller deposits in the vicinity\r\nof Burgas, along the Black Sea coast, and near Sofia to the north and\r\nwest of the city. Estimated reserves total in excess of 10 million tons.\r\n\r\nCoal has been located in some twenty small deposits. There is an\r\nanthracite basin in the Stara Planina twenty miles north of Sofia and\r\nanother in the extreme northwest end of the range. Bituminous coal\r\noccurs in a larger basin in the central Stara Planina, but brown coals\r\nand lignite are much more abundant.\r\n\r\nCopper, lead, and zinc are mined in quantities that exceed domestic\r\nrequirements. Bulgaria ranks high in the production of them among the\r\neastern and southeastern European countries and exports small amounts of\r\nthem. Among the other metallic ores, Bulgaria has three of the more\r\nimportant alloying metals--manganese, molybdenum, and chromium--but the\r\nmanganese is of poor quality. Uranium has been discovered in several\r\ndeposits near Sofia and is being extracted from one or more of them.\r\nGold occurs in a number of locations but in small quantities.\r\n\r\nOf the fuels, coal is by far the most abundant and most important to the\r\neconomy. The search for oil and natural gas resources was intensive in\r\nthe early post-World War II years, and what were hoped to be valuable\r\nfields were discovered in the early 1960s. Production, however, reached\r\na peak in the latter part of that decade. If it becomes economic to\r\nexploit them, there are oil-bearing shales west of Sofia and in the\r\nnorthwestern region of the country. The extent of these shales appears\r\nto be limited, but their potential is believed to be considerably\r\ngreater than that of the oil-bearing formations where the crude product\r\nis extracted by pumping.\r\n\r\nOther minerals extracted include salt, kaolin, chalk, talc, asbestos,\r\ngypsum, mica, fluorite, quartzite, antimony, lime, sandstone, slate, and\r\npyrites. The pyrites are plentiful and produce exportable quantities of\r\nsulfur and sulfur products. Fuel resources tend to be concentrated in\r\nbasins and on lower lands; most other resources, both metal and\r\nnonmetal, are more frequently found in the Rodopi, the western Stara\r\nPlanina, and in the other western highlands.\r\n\r\nMineral waters are locally considered to be an important resource. The\r\ncountry boasts some 500 mineral springs, about one-half of which are\r\nwarm or hot. Their mineral content varies, as does the concentration of\r\nthe chemicals. The stronger of those considered medicinal are used for\r\ndrinking only. The milder are used for drinking and bathing. Sofia has\r\nactive hot springs that have been in use and have attracted people to\r\nthe area for centuries. Its first settlement was built around such a\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS\r\n\r\nBoundaries\r\n\r\nBulgaria has had nearly a century of modern independence, during which\r\nits borders have invariably been imposed upon it by others. This has\r\nbeen the case partly because the Balkan Peninsula was for many years a\r\npawn in the balance-of-power politics of the more powerful European\r\nnations and also because Bulgaria has been on the losing side in three\r\nof its four major wars. It even fared badly at the peace table after the\r\nonly war in which it emerged victorious (see ch. 2).\r\n\r\nIn spite of these circumstances, the country has boundaries that have\r\nmany natural physical characteristics and that have imposed no serious\r\neconomic hardship on any significant group of people. They also contain\r\na large percentage of the Bulgarian people, although numerous population\r\nresettlement movements have contributed to this end. None of its borders\r\nare officially disputed.\r\n\r\nThe total boundary of Bulgaria is about 1,415 miles long. Rivers account\r\nfor about 425 miles of it, the Black Sea coast for 248 miles, and a\r\ngreat portion of the remainder adheres to ridges in high terrain.\r\n\r\nThe western and northern boundaries are shared with Yugoslavia and\r\nRomania, respectively, and the Black Sea coastline constitutes the\r\nentire eastern border. The southern boundary is shared with Greece and\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nNationalists have territorial ambitions stemming from the size of the\r\nMiddle Ages Bulgarian empire that encompassed about one-half of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula but, in the local political climate that has existed\r\nsince World War II, such ambitions are not seriously considered.\r\n\r\nThe post-World War I boundaries were established in rough detail by the\r\nTreaty of Peace between the Allied and associated powers and Bulgaria,\r\nsigned in 1919 at Neuilly-sur-Seine. They were demarcated by\r\ninternational commissions between 1919 and 1922, formalized by the\r\nTreaty of Lausanne in 1923, and reconfirmed by the Treaty of Paris in\r\n1947.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, again as an ally of Germany, Bulgaria briefly\r\nreacquired the coveted portions of Macedonia and Thrace, but the\r\ninterwar boundaries were restored without much deliberation in 1947 with\r\nthe agreement of the Soviet Union as well as all of the other major\r\nvictorious allies. Small deviations from the borders established in the\r\nearly 1920s have been made for local reasons, but none of them have been\r\nof national significance.\r\n\r\nThe 335-mile border with Yugoslavia was drawn in an attempt to follow\r\nthe high ridges separating the watersheds of the Morava and Vardar river\r\nvalleys in Yugoslavia from those of the Iskur and Struma valleys in\r\nBulgaria. The border starts in the north at the junction of the Timok\r\nRiver and the Danube, but it follows the river for only about ten miles.\r\nLeaving the Timok (with a few exceptions when it must cross river\r\nvalleys), it remains on high ground until it reaches the tripoint with\r\nGreece. Although nationalist Bulgarians continue to feel that Bulgaria's\r\nshare of Macedonia--which it shares with both Yugoslavia and Greece--is\r\nless than just, there are no overt official disputes of the boundary.\r\n\r\nThe border with Greece is 307 miles long--all but forty-nine miles of\r\nwhich are overland. The major portion of it follows higher elevations\r\nand ridges in the Rodopi. East of the Struma and Mesta river valleys,\r\ninsofar as it is feasible, the border is at the dividing line between\r\nthe Maritsa River basin and those of the streams that flow southward to\r\nthe Aegean Sea.\r\n\r\nFollowing an official visit by the Greek foreign minister to Sofia in\r\n1946, the Bulgarian premier stated that \"all territorial claims [between\r\nGreece and Bulgaria] are excluded forever.\" This statement indicates\r\nthat boundary frictions that had persisted for many years were\r\nofficially eliminated at that time, and as of 1973 the border was not\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish border is 149 miles long. It follows small rivers and\r\nstreams for more than 40 percent of its length, but neither they nor the\r\noverland sections constitute physical boundaries or barriers of any\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThe Romanian border follows the Danube River for about 290 miles from\r\nthe northwestern corner of the country to the city of Silistra and then\r\ncuts to the east-southeast for about eighty-five miles across the old\r\nprovince of Dobrudzha. The Danube, with steep bluffs on the Bulgarian\r\nside and a wide area of swamps and marshes along much of the Romanian,\r\nis one of the better natural river boundaries in Europe. Most of the\r\nriver islands that might be expected to bridge the gap between the\r\ncountries are damp and covered with marsh vegetation. They are subject\r\nto regular inundation by floodwaters and, therefore, are uninhabited.\r\nThe line across Dobrudzha is arbitrary and has been redrawn on several\r\noccasions. The population of the area that has changed hands is mixed,\r\nbut most of those who have strong national preferences have been\r\nresettled in the country of their choice.\r\n\r\nA joint resolution adopted between Bulgaria and Romania in April 1971\r\nallowed somewhat easier transit of their border. A passport was still\r\nrequired, but residents of the twelve-mile-wide zone on each side of the\r\nborder became able to make one crossing each month without a visa. Each\r\nvisit was limited to six days, and the destination and residence to be\r\nvisited were subject to the approval of local police. The agreement made\r\nno changes in custom regulations and was not, therefore, intended to\r\nchange trade relations between the countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Subdivisions\r\n\r\nThe country is subdivided into twenty-eight _okruzi_ (sing., _okrug_),\r\nwhich are usually translated as districts, and has some 200 towns and\r\ncities and approximately 5,500 villages or settlements. The cities and\r\nlarger towns are subdivided into _rayoni_ (sing., _rayon_), and the\r\nsmaller villages are grouped together into _obshtini_ (sing.,\r\n_obshtina_). The _rayoni_ and _obshtini_ are the urban boroughs and\r\nvillage communes that are the smallest units of local government, that\r\nis, those that have people's councils (see fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThe twenty-eight _okruzi_ include one for the city of Sofia and its\r\nimmediate vicinity as well as one for a larger Sofia district. Each\r\n_okrug_ is named for the city that is its administrative center. They\r\nhave areas ranging from 794 to 2,916 square miles and populations of\r\nabout 130,000 to about 650,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3. Political Subdivisions of Bulgaria, 1973_]\r\n\r\nThe number of _okruzi_ has been changed only at times of major\r\ngovernmental reorganization, the most recent of which was in 1959. The\r\n_obshtini_, on the other hand, are in a state of relatively constant\r\nchange. Cities grow, towns become cities, new enterprises are set up and\r\nattract population, and other factors affect the need for local\r\nadministration. Since the reorganization of 1959, when the _obshtini_\r\nwere reduced by nearly one-half--from about 1,950 to just over\r\n1,000--their number has tended to grow again. By the late 1960s there\r\nwere about 1,150 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT PATTERNS\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians, who were mounted archers from the steppes of central\r\nAsia, rode into the area between the Danube River and the Stara Planina\r\nin the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. They interbred with the Slavs\r\nand adopted a Slavic language and many Slavic customs, but they retained\r\nenough individuality to remain readily identifiable. In spite of\r\nhorrifying defeats and treatment at the hands of Byzantines and\r\nOttomans, they were in the land to stay and never relinquished their\r\ntitle to a share of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nFor several centuries before their independence from the Turks, the\r\npeople preferred to live in the hills, motivated by the sheer necessity\r\nof having to escape the notice of their oppressive occupiers. They\r\nreturned to the fertile plains and valleys in large numbers only after\r\nindependence in 1878. Since 1945 there has been a major movement of\r\npeople to the cities as the country has become industrialized, and there\r\nhas been a lesser movement of the rural population resulting from the\r\ncollectivization of agricultural lands.\r\n\r\nEach major movement has brought about some improvement over the\r\nconditions of the period that preceded it. Settlement in the back hills\r\nwas particularly necessary during the last years of Turkish control,\r\nwhen the Ottoman Empire was in decline and its local controls and\r\ntaxation became increasingly oppressive. To avoid attracting attention\r\nto themselves, the people settled into small hamlets and built their\r\nhomes as bare and unattractive as possible.\r\n\r\nWith independence life on the plains was safer and easier. For a time\r\nthere was plenty of good land available but, as the population grew,\r\ninevitably the land became occupied, and the size of individual\r\nlandholdings decreased. Between the turn of the century and the\r\nmid-1980s, for example, the average landholding decreased from 18.2 to\r\n12.2 acres, a size that was agriculturally uneconomic and that\r\noverpopulated the rural areas. People remained poor and, although it was\r\nno longer necessary to keep them plain, peasant homes amounted to little\r\nmore than small, bare, essential shelter.\r\n\r\nUnder the communist government, the first near-complete collectivization\r\nprogram served to increase the size of farmland units in collective and\r\nstate farms to an average of about 10,000 acres each. In 1970, with an\r\naverage of less than 1,100 fully employed farmers at each of the larger\r\nunits, the ratio of farmers to acres of arable land had fallen sharply.\r\nIn 1973 the agricultural lands were again recombined, this time into\r\nabout 170 units called agroindustrial complexes. The rural population is\r\nstill, however, for the most part clustered in unplanned, nucleated\r\nvillages or hamlets. Long, single-street villages are rare. Many\r\nvillages are situated in valleys for shelter from cold winter winds. A\r\ngradual movement to housing at the agroindustrial centers will\r\nundoubtedly take place, but there was no indication in 1973 that the\r\nmovement would be a rapid one or that the government intended to make it\r\na matter of urgent priority.\r\n\r\nPost-World War II emphasis on educational and cultural pursuits and\r\nrural development has made more community life and more amenities\r\navailable to the rural areas. Dwelling space remains meager, with only a\r\nlittle more than 500 feet of floorspace per dwelling. By 1970 central\r\nwater supplies were available to over 90 percent of the population, but\r\nfewer than one half of the dwellings had individual service. Nearly all\r\ndwellings have electricity.\r\n\r\nBulgaria has been primarily agricultural and has been overrun, pillaged,\r\nand occupied by so many conquerors that its cities have suffered, and\r\ntheir inhabitants have had less opportunity than have those in most\r\nEuropean countries to develop a culture. There are relatively few cities\r\nwith noteworthy associations with the country's past. There are,\r\nhowever, a few notable exceptions, and some of their histories antedate\r\nthe introduction of the Bulgar people into the region. There are others\r\nthat, if not altogether new, have had rapid and well-planned growth\r\nduring the country's recent history. Modern city growth has been\r\naccompanied by the construction of large numbers of apartment houses,\r\nmany of them built as rapidly as possible to recover space destroyed\r\nduring World War II and to accommodate the heavy influx of people to\r\nurban areas.\r\n\r\nSofia was founded by the Thracians and has had a continuous history of\r\nsome importance for 2,000 years. No trace of its original founders\r\nremains in the city, although it retained its Thracian name, Serdica,\r\nwhile it was a part of the Roman Empire. It is situated in a sheltered\r\nbasin at the base of the Vitosha range, a location that has been both\r\nstrategically and esthetically desirable. Long-established\r\ncommunications routes cross at the city. The most traveled and most\r\nfamous is that from Belgrade to Istanbul. It is Sofia's main street for\r\nthat portion of its route. At the city it crosses the north-south route\r\nfrom the Aegean Sea to the Danube River that uses the Struma and Iskur\r\nriver valleys. Some of the other routes that radiate from the city,\r\nparticularly those to the Black Sea coastal cities, are of more local\r\nimportance than the international routes. Sofia's pleasant climate, plus\r\nits strategic location, made the city a contender in the selection of a\r\ncapital for Rome in Emperor Constantine's reign. Its hot springs were an\r\nadded attraction to the Romans, and their baths remain.\r\n\r\nSofia was a thriving city under the Romans. Attila the Hun destroyed it\r\nin the fifth century A.D., but it was rebuilt in the sixth and seventh\r\ncenturies, when its population grew to about 40,000. It declined again\r\nunder the Ottomans, and in 1878, when it was liberated, it had only some\r\n15,000-20,000 inhabitants. It has grown rapidly since becoming the\r\ncapital of the modern state.\r\n\r\nSofia is the city's fourth name. Saint Sophia's sixth-century church\r\noccupies the highest land in the city and is one of the most famous of\r\nits landmarks, although the city was named for her several centuries\r\nafter the church was built. As the capital, the city has most of the\r\nnation's administration and has become the educational and cultural\r\ncenter of the country. It retains much charm and beauty, in spite of its\r\nrapid growth. From its hundreds of small parks and thousands of trees,\r\nit claims the right to call itself the garden city.\r\n\r\nPlovdiv is the second most important city. It is older than Sofia,\r\nhaving been established in the fourth century B.C. by Philip of Macedon;\r\nit was first named Philippopolis after him. On the plain and astride the\r\nroute from Belgrade to Istanbul, it has been exposed to all who have\r\npassed that way, for good or ill, and this is reflected in its violent\r\nhistory. It has been captured and devastated in turn by Greeks, Romans,\r\nGoths, Huns, and Turks. It was also ravished on four different occasions\r\nby Christian armies during the Crusades.\r\n\r\nPlovdiv has continued to be an important commercial city, having more\r\nrail lines radiating from it than Sofia. It also has a university and\r\nsome of the country's most important museums and art treasures. The old\r\ntown center is typically Macedonian and, although it was severely\r\ndamaged by an earthquake in 1928, part of it has been termed a national\r\nmonument, to be reworked only for its restoration.\r\n\r\nVeliko Turnovo, situated astride a mountain stream on the northern\r\nslopes of the central Stara Planina, was the fortress capital of the\r\nmedieval Second Bulgarian Kingdom. It was also the site of the first\r\nconstituent assembly held as the country was liberated from the Turks,\r\nand the Turnovo Constitution was adopted there in 1879. It remains an\r\nartistic and cultural center, and some of its fine examples of Bulgarian\r\nrenaissance architecture have survived.\r\n\r\nVarna and Burgas are the chief Black Sea ports, and Ruse is the only\r\nmajor Bulgarian port on the Danube River. Burgas is a young city,\r\ngrowing to most of its size in the late 1800s, and it was a more\r\nimportant port than Varna until the 1950s. Varna, however, attracted the\r\nnaval academy, has become the naval base, and has acquired most of the\r\nshipbuilding industry. Ruse has also grown rapidly. In addition to its\r\nriver trade, the first bridge across the river between Bulgaria and\r\nRomania was built just north of the city.\r\n\r\nA number of new towns have been built since World War II, in some cases\r\nfrom the ground up. These include some at industrial complexes, others\r\nat resorts. Madan is a new mining center in the Rodopi; Dimitrovgrad is\r\na new industrial town on the Maritsa River; and there are several\r\nmountain and seaside resort cities. Zlatni Pyassutsi (Golden Sands),\r\nopened in 1956, is one of a group of Black Sea resort cities that, upon\r\nopening, could accommodate tens of thousands of holiday vacationers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\nStructure\r\n\r\nIn spite of its three most recent wars, comparatively few Bulgarians\r\nlive outside the country in the areas adjacent to its boundaries.\r\nBulgarian sources estimate the total number of Bulgarians abroad at\r\napproximately 1 million. Many of these are in Greek and Yugoslav\r\nMacedonia and are, in fact, Macedonians who may or may not prefer to be\r\ncalled Bulgarians. Other Bulgarians are in Greek Thrace, and a few are\r\nin Romanian Dobrudzha and in Soviet Bessarabia. A scattering are settled\r\nin other Eastern European countries, Australia, and North and South\r\nAmerica. There are only a few in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen The Macedonians and Gypsies in the country--whom Bulgarian official\r\nsources include as fully integrated into the Bulgarian population--are\r\nnot counted separately, Bulgarians constitute about 91 percent of the\r\npopulation. The approximately 700,000 Turks out-number all other\r\nnon-Bulgarians in the population by a large margin. Small numbers of\r\nGreeks, Romanians, Armenians, and Jews make up a total of only about 1\r\npercent (see ch. 4).\r\n\r\nIn the absence of official statistics, the number of Macedonians and\r\nGypsies are impossible to estimate accurately. It is probable that there\r\nare a few more Gypsies than Macedonians and that they total about 5\r\npercent of the population. Pomaks (Muslim Bulgarians), who tend to live\r\nseparately, have been persecuted on occasion and have represented a\r\nsocial problem. Some authorities have listed them as a separate ethnic\r\ngroup but, with diminishing emphasis on religion, local authorities\r\nattempt to make no distinctions between them and the rest of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is one of an extremely few countries in the world where the\r\nmales in the population have outnumbered the females over a considerable\r\nportion of its modern history. This has been a phenomenon that could not\r\nbe adequately explained by events or circumstances; but of nine censuses\r\ntaken between 1887 and 1965, only in those taken in 1920 and 1947 did\r\nthe females constitute a majority. These two years following the great\r\nwars were undoubtedly atypical in that, although Bulgaria did not suffer\r\ngreat manpower losses from war casualties, the males were probably more\r\nmobile, and many of them may not have returned to the country or, in the\r\nimmediate aftermath of the wars, may not yet have settled down (see\r\ntable 1).\r\n\r\n_Table 1.

The reversal reflects a change in life\r\nexpectancy statistics. Around the turn of the century average life\r\nexpectancy was forty years, and females are estimated to have outlived\r\nmales by less than six months. Seventy years later, average life\r\nexpectancy had increased by twenty-five years, but females were\r\noutliving males by an average of about four years. Projected from the\r\n1965 census and from vital statistics information accumulated since that\r\ntime, numerical equality between the sexes came about in the late 1960s,\r\nand in mid-1973 it was estimated that females outnumbered males by the\r\nsmall majority of 4.334 million to 4.333 million.\r\n\r\nAnother exceptional feature of the Bulgarian population is the unusual\r\nnumber of very old people. Nearly 1 percent of the population in 1970\r\nwas eighty years old or older, and more than 500 people were\r\ncentenarians. Of these, three-fifths were women.\r\n\r\nPeople in rural areas, after having long outnumbered those in cities and\r\ntowns, became the minority in 1969. More than four-fifths of the\r\npopulation was rural at the time of independence in 1878, and more than\r\nthree-quarters was still rural in 1947. The movement to the towns\r\naccelerated with the post-World War II industrialization. Towns that\r\nattracted industries have grown by factors of five or more since 1920,\r\nand by far the most dramatic growth has occurred since 1947.\r\n\r\nWith 8.7 million people occupying 42,800 square miles in 1972, the\r\naverage population density for the country was 203 persons per square\r\nmile. Regions where the densities were highest include the Sofia Basin\r\nand the southwestern portion of the Thracian Plain. The population was\r\nmore dense than average in the western and central portion of the\r\nDanubian plateau, in the lower eastern Rodopi, and in the vicinities of\r\nVarna and Burgas on the Black Sea coast. It was least dense in the\r\nhigher mountains, particularly in the high western Rodopi, the Pirin and\r\nthe Rila, and along the narrow high ridge of the Stara Planina.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamics\r\n\r\nWarfare that was endemic to the Balkan Peninsula throughout much of its\r\nearly history, exploitation by the Ottomans, and living conditions that\r\ncontributed to a short life expectancy served to hold down the\r\npopulation of the area before independence. Since 1878, although the\r\ncountry has participated in four wars and most migratory movements have\r\nbeen at Bulgaria's expense, the population has tripled.\r\n\r\nGrowth has been comparatively steady during the century of independence.\r\nIts rate has fluctuated but not widely. Until 1910 it was high. It\r\ndropped during the 1910-20 decade, which included the Balkan wars and\r\nWorld War I. The period of greatest growth occurred between the great\r\nwars, and the three decades since 1941 have been the periods of least\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nVital statistics supplied by the Bulgarian government to the United\r\nNations in 1972 indicated an annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. This was\r\nbased on 16.3 births per each 1,000 of the population, as against 9.1\r\ndeaths. Infant mortality, included in the overall death rate, was 27.3\r\ndeaths during the first year for each 1,000 live births. In early 1973\r\nthe government was alarmed at an apparent change in the statistical\r\ntrend. Complete information for 1971 showed that, instead of 16.3 births\r\nper 1,000, the actual figure was 15.9. Indications were that in 1972 it\r\nwas dropping to 15.4.\r\n\r\nInternal migrations since 1878 have consisted largely of the initial\r\nmovement of the rural population from the hills to the plains and the\r\nlater movement of people from the rural areas to the towns. External\r\nmigrations have been more complex. The earliest occurred in the\r\naftermath of the liberation; later ones have resulted from the\r\nanimosities and territorial changes associated with the various wars in\r\nwhich the country has been involved.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied the territory, Turks left in wholesale numbers when they\r\nlost control of it. More of them departed during the Balkan wars. Large\r\ngroups emigrated in the 1920s and 1930s, and more were forced to leave\r\nafter World War II. Estimates as to the numbers involved in each move\r\nvary widely; the two largest after 1880 were those in the 1920s and\r\nafter World War II, and the total in all emigrations of Turks probably\r\nequals or exceeds the 700,000 that remain in the country. Natural\r\npopulation increases have been such that, over the long term, the actual\r\nnumber of Turks in the country has changed relatively little.\r\n\r\nThere have been smaller population exchanges with each of the other\r\nneighbors. In the mid-1920s about 250,000 Bulgarians moved from Greek\r\nThrace into Bulgaria, and about 40,000 Greeks left Bulgaria for Greece.\r\nAfter 1940, when southern Dobrudzha was annexed from Romania, some\r\n110,000 Romanians were exchanged for about 62,000 Bulgarians.\r\nMacedonians, also in considerable numbers, have chosen between Bulgaria\r\nand Yugoslavia, requiring many of them to move.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people, faring much better in Bulgaria during World War II\r\nthan they did in Adolph Hitler's Germany or in most of the countries\r\noverrun by the Germans, have nonetheless emigrated to Israel in large\r\nnumbers. Before that war there were about 50,000 of them in the country,\r\nbut 90 percent or more of them emigrated during the early postwar years.\r\n\r\nAll of the major emigrations were completed before 1960. There appear to\r\nbe no reasons why others of similar proportions should occur in the\r\nforeseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Force\r\n\r\nIn mid-1972 there were 5.8 million people in the working-age group\r\n(fifteen to sixty-four years), although the legal retirement age in most\r\nemployment situations is sixty or sixty-five for males and five years\r\nyounger for females. About 4.4 million--just over one-half of the total\r\npopulation and three-quarters of those of working age--constituted the\r\nlabor force. Population projections indicate that in the ten-year period\r\nafter 1972 the working-age group will increase by 0.3 million, but a\r\nlarge percentage of the increase will be in the segment of the group\r\naged fifty to sixty-four.\r\n\r\nAbout 95 percent of the males between twenty-five and sixty-four years\r\nof age are economically active. The percentage of economically active\r\nfemales is lower, but they have constituted over 40 percent of the labor\r\nforce. About 36.5 percent of the economically active are employed in\r\nagricultural fields; of the remaining 63.5 percent, about one-half are\r\nemployed in industry. The others are in various service, administrative,\r\nor other miscellaneous activities.\r\n\r\nBecause the country was late in emerging from a predominantly\r\nagricultural economy, its working force has had little technological\r\nexperience. Since World War II, however, schools have been increasingly\r\noriented to train young people to become technologically competent, and\r\nsome success in this direction has been achieved. Whether or not the\r\nworking force is being used as effectively as is possible under the\r\ncircumstances is being debated, but the government finds a decrease in\r\nthe birthrate and its possible limiting effect on industrial production\r\na cause for considerable concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nRailroads\r\n\r\nThe first railroad built in the country was constructed by the British\r\nin 1866 and connected Ruse on the Danube River with Varna on the Black\r\nSea. The famous and romantic Orient Express and the Berlin-to-Baghdad\r\nroute have used a common line through Bulgaria, entering the country\r\nfrom Belgrade. The route crosses the western mountains at the Dragoman\r\nPass, continues through Sofia, Plovdiv, and down the Maritsa River\r\nvalley to Edirne and Istanbul in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe rail network consists of about 3,775 miles of track, about 2,620 of\r\nwhich were being operated in 1970. Of the portion in use, about 2,470\r\nmiles were standard gauge, and 150 were narrow gauge. Approximately 135\r\nmiles were double track, and a little more than 500 had been\r\nelectrified. Because of the terrain, the system has a large number of\r\nbridges and tunnels and has been constructed with tighter curves and\r\nsteeper gradients than are allowed when terrain features are less\r\nextreme. Most of the some 1,600 bridges are short, but at Ruse, where\r\nthe Danube is crossed, the river is 1-½ miles wide. Most of the\r\napproximately 175 tunnels are also short. One is 3-½ miles in length,\r\nbut they total only about thirty miles (see fig. 4).\r\n\r\nRoute mileage is adequate to meet the requirements of the country. It\r\nwill probably not be expanded further; shorter spurs become uneconomic\r\nand are abandoned as motor transport takes over short-haul traffic.\r\nProgrammed modernization includes improving roadbeds, ties, and track to\r\nachieve a higher load-bearing capacity. Quantity installation of\r\ncontinuously welded rail is also underway, and the busiest of the lines\r\nare being electrified.\r\n\r\nAlthough the system is adequate, performs its services reasonably well,\r\nand continues to be the backbone of domestic transport, it suffers in\r\nbare statistical comparisons with the other carriers. Highway transport\r\nmay carry a cargo to the rail station and get credit for a second\r\nshipment when it moves the same goods from the train to its final\r\ndestination. Trucks also carry local freight more directly and much more\r\nsimply than railroads for short hauls. Ton mileage statistics of the\r\nmerchant marine are similarly misleading. Although the railroads remain\r\nby far the most important domestic carrier, their share of total cargo\r\ncarried and their share of ton mileage continues to decrease (see table\r\n2).\r\n\r\nThe railroads also continue to give way to motor vehicles in numbers of\r\npassengers carried. Between 1960 and 1970 the situation changed\r\nradically; on the earlier date the railroads carried more passengers\r\nthan buses did, but a decade later they carried hardly more than\r\none-third as many. In long-distance passenger travel, the railroads\r\nremained the major carrier by a narrow margin in 1970, although the\r\ndifference was narrowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4.

As late as 1962 the country had no diesel locomotives and only\r\na few passenger-carrying electric trains. By 1972, about 80 percent of\r\nthe freight and a larger proportion of passenger traffic were carried on\r\ndiesel or electric trains. Steam locomotives will probably have been\r\nreplaced completely by 1978.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads\r\n\r\nConstruction is expensive, engineering problems are frequently\r\nchallenging, and the roads are difficult to maintain on the mountainous\r\nterrain, with its many narrow and steep gorges. Ice and snow close most\r\nroutes at times during the winter months. Spring thaws and floods damage\r\nthe best roads and make the poorer roads impassable for considerable\r\nperiods. Of the approximately 21,000 miles of roadway, about 8,000 are\r\npaved, another 8,000 have surfaces hardened with stone or gravel, but\r\nnearly 5,000 remain dirt surfaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaterways\r\n\r\nThe 290 miles of the Danube River that flow along the northern border\r\nare navigable. Other streams are too short, too shallow, or have too\r\ngreat gradients to use or to allow development as waterways. The fact\r\nthat the Danube leaves the country to exit into the Black Sea from\r\nRomania limits its potential as an avenue to seagoing trade, and the\r\nfact that it flows along the country's periphery keeps it from being the\r\ncentral feature that it is, for example, in Hungary. Bulgaria's entire\r\nportion of the river is, however, downstream from the Iron Gate and thus\r\ncan handle 2,500-ton vessels. There are no locks or dams in this area\r\nand, although it freezes for a short time in the winter and floods\r\nduring the spring, it is usable for an average of about 300 days per\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea is more commercially significant to Bulgaria. Burgas and\r\nVarna are thriving ports. Burgas has been a busy port for a longer time,\r\nbut Varna has developed rapidly and by 1970 had surpassed Burgas as the\r\nmajor port and had become the center of maritime industry in the\r\ncountry. Between 1971 and 1975, for example, the city expects to produce\r\n23,000-ton and 38,000-ton dry cargo ships in series production and to\r\nbuild one, and possibly more, 80,000-ton tankers.\r\n\r\nBy 1970 inland waterways--which consisted exclusively of the Danube\r\nRiver--were carrying only about 0.6 percent of the country's freight\r\ncargo. Because the distances that the average cargo was transported\r\nexceeded those of rail or road transport, however, they accounted for\r\nabout 2.5 percent of the total ton mileage. Seaborne shipping carried\r\nabout 2.5 percent of the total cargo weight but, because of the far\r\ngreater shipping distances, it accounted for nearly two-thirds of the\r\ntotal ton mileage. Traffic transported by inland waterway remained\r\nrelatively constant during the late 1960s and early 1970s; traffic\r\ncarried on seagoing vessels was increasing rapidly.\r\n\r\nUnited Nations reports in 1971 credited Bulgaria with the fastest\r\ndeveloping shipbuilding industry in the world. The pronouncement is less\r\nmeaningful than it might appear, however, because the industry started\r\nfrom very little. Moreover, a major portion of the products are for\r\nexport, and much of the industry's local impact is as a production,\r\nrather than as a transportation, enterprise. Nonetheless, the country's\r\ncapability for sea shipment increased by more than five times during the\r\n1960s. There are no large passenger vessels in the fleet, but several\r\nhydrofoils, some having capacities to carry more than 100 passengers,\r\noperate between the Danube River ports.\r\n\r\nBy 1972 the merchant marine consisted of more than 100 ships, having a\r\ntotal of nearly 1 million deadweight tons. It has increased at an\r\naverage rate of about 6 percent a year between 1967 and 1971, the rates\r\nof increase accelerating in the latter part of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nAirways\r\n\r\nCivil aviation was carried on by Bulgarian Civil Air Transport before\r\n1970, when that entity was reorganized as Balkan-Bulgarian Airlines\r\n(BALKAN). Its airplanes, all of Soviet manufacture, are identified by\r\nBALKAN inset within a five-pointed star that is elongated to give the\r\nimpression of flight. BALKAN operates under the Ministry of Transport.\r\n\r\nSofia is the center of all the air operations. International routes stop\r\nat the capitals of the six other Warsaw Pact countries and at sixteen\r\nother cities in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The 1973\r\nscheduled flights also connected Sofia with eleven other cities within\r\nBulgaria, most of them on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nPercentages of total cargo and passenger traffic carried by air are\r\ninsignificant, and the rates of increase in the utilization of air\r\ntransportation have been erratic. Air cargo shipments, for example,\r\nincreased by a factor of seven between 1960 and 1967 but increased\r\nlittle the following year and decreased for the remainder of the\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Bulgaria emerged from Turkish rule as a homogeneous, egalitarian\r\npeasant society centered in the family and the community. Through the\r\nintroduction of foreign economic and social ideas and institutions, the\r\nsociety gradually changed during the period between the two world wars.\r\nAt the time of World War II Bulgaria actually had two social systems:\r\nthe traditional peasant society, changing but still focused on the\r\nfamily and the community, and a growing urban society that focused on\r\nthe economy and the state. When the Communists took power in 1944, they\r\nset out to destroy the old social order and replace it with one that\r\nwould reflect communist ideology. The resulting changes have been far\r\nreaching and basic. The traditional economic and value base has been\r\ndestroyed by the elimination of private property. Social distinctions\r\nwere introduced and magnified where none or few existed. Traditional\r\ninstitutions, such as the church and the family, were weakened; and new\r\ninstitutions, such as mass organizations, were introduced to take their\r\nplace. Many segments of the population benefited materially from changes\r\nthat opened new opportunities for education and social advancement;\r\nhowever, the price paid for these benefits was the loss of such\r\nimportant motivating forces as freedom of choice, independence of\r\naction, and the right to own income-producing property.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1970s the rate of change was slowing down, and the society\r\nwas settling into a discernible pattern. Some aspects of the old social\r\norder seem to have survived, providing a continuity between the old and\r\nthe new. The changes that continue to affect the society are more the\r\nresult of economic growth than of social engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian population is homogeneous in both ethnic and religious\r\ncomposition. Approximately 85 percent is Bulgarian, and some 90 percent\r\nadheres at least nominally to the Eastern Orthodox faith. The most\r\nsignificant ethnic minorities are the Turks, who number about 700,000,\r\nor 8 percent of the population; the Gypsies, estimated at 200,000, or\r\n2.5 percent of the population; and the Macedonians, who also number\r\napproximately 200,000. The remainder are Greeks, Romanians, Armenians,\r\nand Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish minority, once considerably more substantial in size, dates\r\nback to the centuries of Turkish rule (see ch. 2). A steady emigration\r\nof Turks from Bulgaria to Turkey after World War I and the expulsion of\r\nsome 150,000 in the 1950-51 period reduced their number. Most of the\r\nremaining Turks are tobacco growers or artisans, who live in rural areas\r\nin the eastern third of the country and along the Danube River. Their\r\ntraditional peasant conservatism, bolstered by their Islamic faith, has\r\nmade them less willing to adapt to the contemporary social order than\r\nthe rest of the population. A majority would like to emigrate to Turkey,\r\nbut the Bulgarian government has been unwilling to let them go because\r\nthe country cannot afford such a population loss.\r\n\r\nTurkey, for its part, could not absorb the Bulgarian Turks without\r\nseriously endangering its own economy and therefore has not encouraged\r\ntheir desires. By agreement between the two governments, about 30,000\r\nclose relatives of Turks who left Bulgaria in the 1950-51 period will be\r\nallowed to emigrate during the 1970s. The majority of Bulgarian Turks,\r\nhowever, have little hope of leaving in the foreseeable future. In spite\r\nof the desire of its members to leave the country, the Turkish minority\r\nhas posed no serious problem to the Bulgarian government. The government\r\nhas made an effort to integrate the minority into national life, at the\r\nsame time preserving its cultural distinctions, which are guaranteed by\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nGypsies are not considered a national minority by the state, although\r\nthey consider themselves such. Strongly attached to their nomadic way of\r\nlife, the Gypsies have been reluctant to settle in a permanent place and\r\nto integrate themselves into the national society. They continue to\r\nfollow their traditional occupations as musicians, tinsmiths, and\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a Macedonian minority has been disputed over many\r\ndecades by Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Bulgaria has consistently claimed\r\nthat Macedonians are ethnically Bulgarians, that their language is a\r\ndialect of Bulgarian, and that their land is a part of Bulgaria.\r\nYugoslavia, on the other hand, has given legal recognition to a\r\nMacedonian nationality by establishing the People's Republic of\r\nMacedonia and by designating the Macedonian language one of the official\r\nlanguages of the federal republic (see ch. 2; ch. 10).\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Bulgarians have been born into the Bulgarian\r\nOrthodox Church ever since the ninth century, when Boris I adopted\r\nChristianity for his people. Until World War II a person had no legal\r\nexistence without a baptismal certificate from the church. In keeping\r\nwith Eastern Orthodox tradition, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is an\r\nindependent national church. It is inseparably linked with Bulgarian\r\nnationhood in the minds of most Bulgarians because of the role it played\r\nin preserving a national consciousness during the centuries of Turkish\r\nrule and in spearheading a national revival in the nineteenth century\r\n(see ch. 2).\r\n\r\nA tradition of religious freedom and tolerance allowed religious\r\nminorities to exist without friction. Even during World War II the Jews\r\nin Bulgaria suffered little persecution in comparison with those in\r\nother parts of Eastern Europe. No census of religious affiliation has\r\nbeen taken since the Communists took power; however, according to\r\nvarious estimates in 1965 there were about 750,000 Muslims; 26,000\r\nProtestants; 32,000 Roman Catholics; and between 3,000 and 7,000 Jews.\r\nThe Muslim population included most Turks and some 50,000 Pomaks\r\n(Bulgarians who converted to Islam during Turkish rule) living in the\r\nrugged Rodopi mountain range.\r\n\r\nReligious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution, but churches are\r\nsubject to strict governmental control. Formal religious education is\r\nrestricted to the training of priests. Children, however, continue to be\r\ninstructed in the rudiments of faith and ritual by their families.\r\nDespite government efforts to secularize the milestones in the life\r\ncycle, a large percentage of Bulgarians continue to regard the priest as\r\nan essential officiant at baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Churchgoing\r\nand the strict fasts prescribed by the Eastern Orthodox church have not\r\nbeen carefully observed by most Bulgarians since the 1930s;\r\nnevertheless, the people often exhibit strong religious feelings\r\ntempered by traditional beliefs in the powers of nature, the evil eye,\r\nand other forces. A survey conducted by the Bulgarian Academy of\r\nSciences in the mid-1960s classified 35.5 percent of those surveyed as\r\nreligious and 64.4 percent as nonreligious. The criteria used to\r\ndetermine whether a person was religious or not was either a verbal\r\nexpression of religious conviction or regular attendance at church\r\nservices and regular prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY\r\n\r\nUntil the time of World War I Bulgarian society was frequently\r\ncharacterized as familistic, that is, personal interests and\r\nprerogatives of an individual were subordinated to the values and\r\ndemands of the family. The family was the focal unit in society; it was\r\nthe chief training ground for the young and played the leading part in\r\nmolding the individual into the accepted pattern. The family was the\r\ncenter of economic life also, particularly for the peasants, who lived\r\nrelatively self-sufficient lives. Relations with other social units and\r\ninstitutions were carried out through the family rather than by the\r\nindividual. An individual had no standing in society apart from that of\r\nhis family, and individual behavior and prestige reflected on the family\r\nas a whole. Individualism, therefore, was discouraged by constant\r\npressure from the family to conform to custom and tradition.\r\n\r\nThe traditional family was patriarchal and strongly authoritarian. It\r\nreflected many features characteristic of the _zadruga_, the extended\r\nfamily that formed the basis of social organization of the South Slavs,\r\nincluding the Bulgarians, until its gradual decline in the late\r\nnineteenth century. A _zadruga_ consisted of the male offspring of the\r\nsame parents and perhaps grandparents, with their wives and children,\r\nliving together and jointly owning and working the ancestral lands. The\r\ngroup was ruled by the elected head, usually the oldest and most capable\r\nmale, who was responsible for directing the work, for settling disputes,\r\nand generally for providing for the well-being of the _zadruga_ as a\r\nwhole and for each of its members.\r\n\r\nBy law and by custom, even after the passing of the _zadruga_ as a\r\nsocial institution, authority over all matters concerning the family\r\nrested with the father. In the village married sons with their wives and\r\nchildren and unmarried children all tended to live under the father's\r\nroof until his death, at which time the oldest son took over the family\r\nhomestead, and the others built their own houses nearby. The authority\r\nof the patriarch rested, in no small measure, on his ownership and\r\ncontrol of the means of livelihood of the family. Sons submitted to\r\ntheir father's will in order to inherit their fair shares of the\r\npatrimony.\r\n\r\nClose family relations were maintained not only with blood relatives but\r\nwith relatives by marriage and with godparents. The bond between two\r\nfamilies also related by marriage was as close, formally, as the bond\r\nwith blood relatives; it included not only the parents of the married\r\ncouple but also the brothers and sisters. For that reason parents took\r\ngreat interest in their children's choice of mates. Similarly, the bond\r\nbetween godparents and the family of the godchild was considered as\r\nclose as that of blood kin. The strong relationship between the two\r\nfamilies was developed partly because the same family usually provided\r\nthe godparents for another family for generations. Reciprocity of\r\ngodparenthood, however, was not allowed because a family tie was\r\nestablished with the first christening. Members of families who were\r\nrelated through godparenthood or through marriage could not marry\r\nbecause that would have been tantamount to incest.\r\n\r\nAge and sex determined the individual's role within the family and his\r\nrelations with other members. Men occupied a superior position, and\r\nwomen were expected to show deference to their husbands and to older\r\nmale relatives. A frequently cited image of Bulgaria at that time was\r\nthe man riding a horse or donkey empty-handed while his wife walked\r\nbehind carrying a heavy load. The position and influence of the wife,\r\nhowever, was far greater than this image implies. Few husbands made\r\ndecisions or took action affecting the family without prior consultation\r\nwith their wives.\r\n\r\nAge was respected because it represented the accumulation of wisdom and\r\nexperience. This greater wisdom and experience also gave the older\r\nmembers of the family authority over the younger ones. Children were\r\nhighly valued as tokens of successful marriages and as economic assets,\r\nbut they were not fussed over. Although they were expected to take their\r\nplaces as active members of the family at a relatively early age by\r\nperforming light household tasks, running errands, and tending animals,\r\nthey were also given considerable freedom to play. Until they reached\r\nmaturity, children were expected to do what they were told by their\r\nparents or by other adults without question.\r\n\r\nThis traditional family system provided for great stability. Each member\r\nknew his place in society and knew what was expected of him, and he\r\ngenerally felt secure and satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe gradual industrialization and urbanization that took place between\r\nthe two world wars slowly introduced changes into the traditional family\r\nsystem--at first among the urban population and eventually among the\r\npeasantry. Most notable among the changes was the shift toward the\r\nnuclear family unit and the disappearance of the extended family\r\nhousehold. This reduced the authority of the father over his adult\r\nchildren, who now formed an independent economic and social unit. It\r\nalso gave greater freedom to young people in choosing their mates and,\r\nthereby, in their relations with each other. Within the nuclear family\r\nthe relationship between husband and wife became a more egalitarian one.\r\nRelations between parents and children also became less authoritarian,\r\nalthough the father's relations to his children continued to be rather\r\nformal.\r\n\r\nThe changes in family life and in the role of the family in society that\r\nbegan to take place between the two world wars accelerated during World\r\nWar II in keeping with the rapid rate of economic change. The greatest\r\nassault on the traditional system, however, came in the second half of\r\nthe 1940s and early 1950s when the new communist government set out to\r\nrevamp Bulgarian society. The already dying patriarchal system was dealt\r\nits final blow with the elimination of inheritance through\r\nnationalization of industry and commerce and collectivization of\r\nagriculture. After the patrimony had been eliminated, a major incentive\r\nfor submission to the patriarch had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that contributed to the end of the patriarchal family and\r\nto the end of parental authoritarianism was the government's appeal to\r\nyouth's desire for independence. Young people are taught to believe that\r\nthey are the foundation of the new Bulgaria and that their elders'\r\ntraditional ways are outmoded and should be discarded. In this way a\r\ngeneration gap has been created, and youths wanting to escape parental\r\ninfluence can count on the state for support. Their escape has been\r\nfacilitated through the expansion of educational facilities, the\r\nexpansion of employment opportunities resulting from economic and\r\nbureaucratic expansion, and by the many youth organizations and youth\r\nactivities--all of which enable young people to spend much time away\r\nfrom home and act independently of their parents.\r\n\r\nThe role of women, which had begun to change in the 1930s, was greatly\r\naltered under the influence of ideology and of economic realities. In\r\nsocial doctrine and law, women are considered equal to men and are\r\ncontinually urged to demand their rights in the home and in the\r\ncommunity. They have also gained considerable independence of movement\r\nthrough the expanded employment opportunities available to them in a\r\ndeveloping economy. In 1968, 80 percent of employable women worked\r\noutside the home. A large percentage of them worked because of the\r\nnecessity to supplement the family income rather than through choice;\r\nnevertheless, the fact that they do work outside the home has altered\r\nthe pattern of family life and the relationships of family members.\r\nWorking mothers must leave their young children in state-operated\r\nnurseries or with relatives and thereby relinquish much of their\r\ninfluence in molding the children into adults. Evidence indicates that\r\nfew mothers like to leave young children in nurseries, preferring to\r\nleave them in the care of trusted relatives or friends. Fathers appear\r\nto be playing a greater role in the raising of children than they did in\r\nthe traditional family.\r\n\r\nHousekeeping is still considered to be entirely or predominantly the\r\nresponsibility of women, whether they work or not. The working woman\r\nspends much time every day after work standing in line at food markets\r\nand other stores, buying the daily necessities. Household appliances and\r\nconvenience foods are scarce luxuries; therefore, housekeeping is a\r\ntime-consuming and tiring activity. Even peasant women must take care of\r\ntheir households and children after putting in the required hours in\r\ncooperative labor, whereas formerly they could fit their field work in\r\nand around their other responsibilities.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of these changes, the traditional roles of family\r\nmembers have been altered. The dominance of the head of the family has\r\ngiven way to a greater distribution of decisionmaking and a greater\r\nindependence on the part of other family members. As family members\r\nspend less time together, the emphasis in daily life is shifted from the\r\nfamily to the outside world. Persons come to be looked at more as\r\nindividuals than as members of a certain family. Individuality and\r\npersonal achievement become as important as family background in\r\ndetermining the status of an individual and his nuclear family.\r\nSimilarly, individual action or personal status no longer reflects on\r\nthe larger family.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the state, marriage is a secular matter governed by civil\r\nlaw. Religious ceremonies are permitted but must be preceded by a civil\r\nmarriage. The minimum age for marriage without parental consent or\r\nspecial permission from the local authorities is eighteen for both men\r\nand women. The urban marriage rate in the 1960s was considerably higher\r\nthan the rural one, reflecting the higher percentage of young people\r\nliving in urban centers. Men generally marry between twenty and thirty\r\nyears of age, and women, between fifteen and twenty-five. The law\r\nassigns equal rights and obligations to both partners in a marriage.\r\nDivorce is relatively easy to obtain and no longer carries the social\r\nstigma of former times; the divorce rate in the early 1970s was average\r\nfor Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nDespite changing patterns of family life, most observers find that the\r\ncohesive force of the extended family continues to be a factor in\r\ncontemporary society. In many cases the cohesiveness is perpetuated or\r\neven strengthened by modern phenomena, such as the chronic housing\r\nshortage and the need for grandparents or other relatives to care for\r\nthe children of working mothers. The housing shortage has revived the\r\ntraditional system of several generations of a family sharing the same\r\nroof. The pressures of change and the burdens of daily life hold\r\nfamilies together, and the traditional sense of family loyalty also\r\nseems to survive. Members of such extended families assist each other in\r\nfinding employment, in gaining admission to special schools, or in\r\nobtaining scarce items of food or clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION\r\n\r\nBefore World War II Bulgaria had a basically egalitarian peasant society\r\nwith a simple social structure. A rural-urban division was more\r\nsignificant than class distinctions, which were just beginning to\r\nemerge. The Bulgarian nobility of the Middle Ages had been destroyed\r\nunder Turkish rule and was not restored with the return to monarchy; the\r\nsmall middle class of merchants, industrialists, bureaucrats, and\r\nprofessionals had come into existence since independence in 1878 and\r\nlacked tradition; an urban working class was just emerging. Few\r\nBulgarians were more than one or two generations removed from their\r\npeasant ancestors, which gave most people a common background.\r\n\r\nThe rural-urban differentiation was socially significant in that it\r\nformed what amounted to two social systems with differing values,\r\ncontrols, and institutions. The rural society focused on the family and\r\nthe community; its outlook was parochial. The urban society focused on\r\ncommerce, industry, and government; its outlook was national and often\r\ninternational, and it was subject to continuous influences from abroad.\r\nThe two systems, however, were closely interrelated because most urban\r\ndwellers had their roots in the village and because both the economy and\r\nthe government depended heavily on the peasant as a supporter and as a\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nThe narrower focus of rural society provided few opportunities for\r\nchoice, and custom over the years set a pattern that was accepted as a\r\nmatter of course. Social standing depended to a large extent on how well\r\nan individual performed within the established pattern, and the\r\ngradations were very slight. The wider focus of urban society, on the\r\nother hand, offered far greater opportunity for choice and freedom of\r\naction. This made for greater differentiation between individuals than\r\nwas possible in the village.\r\n\r\nThe greater freedom and the opportunity for economic and social\r\nadvancement offered by the urban society were most noticeable in the\r\nsocial contrast between the urban worker and his peasant relatives.\r\nAlthough most workers had a very low standard of living, they considered\r\nthemselves emancipated from the restrictions of rural society and,\r\ntherefore, better off. When they returned to the village to visit\r\nrelatives, they were looked up to as persons who had enlarged their\r\nhorizons and bettered their lot in life.\r\n\r\nThe social contrast between the educated urban\r\nintelligentsia--white-collar workers and professionals with a secondary\r\nor a higher education--and the peasant was even greater. Some members of\r\nthe intelligentsia maintained a romanticized attachment to their village\r\norigins, but most of them tried to build up their own status by\r\ndisparaging the rural population. Even the village schoolteacher and\r\nrural physician were seen as unsophisticated country bumpkins, although\r\nthey had the same education as their city counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe urban intelligentsia saw itself and was seen by others as the top\r\ngroup in society, just below the royal family, which occupied the apex\r\nof the social pyramid. The top level of the intelligentsia, that is, the\r\nleaders in the political, economic, and cultural spheres, became a small\r\nentourage surrounding the king and thereby gained additional prestige\r\nand power. The economic position of most of the intelligentsia, however,\r\nwas very precarious because there was an oversupply of graduates for\r\nwhom government employment was virtually the only outlet. Those who had\r\nan official position held on to it against all odds. Others, who could\r\nnot find employment appropriate to their presumed qualifications, sat\r\naround cafés waiting for openings rather than returning to their home\r\nvillages to put their education to use there.\r\n\r\nThe peasant, for his part, was distrustful of the city and of city ways.\r\nHe did not feel inferior--even to the intelligentsia whose education he\r\ngreatly admired. The peasant took pride in his land, in his\r\nself-sufficiency, and in his adherence to custom and tradition. He was\r\nconscious of belonging to the large mass of peasantry that shared his\r\npoint of view, his way of life, and his strong sense of tradition.\r\nDifferences in wealth and economic independence were recognized among\r\npeasant families but did not affect their relationships, which were\r\nbasically egalitarian.\r\n\r\nThe village, town, and city in pre-World War II Bulgaria each had its\r\nsomewhat different social structure. Village structure distinguished\r\nbetween peasants, artisans, and intelligentsia. Innkeepers and\r\nstorekeepers were sometimes identified with the artisans but more\r\nfrequently with the peasants because they were usually peasants who had\r\nsold their land to engage in commerce. Artisans, on the other hand,\r\nunderwent special training to prepare them for their calling. These\r\nspecial skills and the fact that artisans did not have to toil long\r\nhours in the sun or rain put them in a higher social category than\r\npeasants. The elite group was the village intelligentsia--the teacher,\r\ndoctor, priest, mayor, and other officials who had more than an\r\nelementary education. Their prestige derived from their education, and\r\ntheir power derived from their positions. Through their ties to the\r\nwider world, the village intelligentsia bridged the gap between rural\r\nand urban societies.\r\n\r\nThe social structure of towns distinguished between artisans, merchants,\r\nand intelligentsia. In the preindustrial Bulgaria of the 1930s, the\r\nartisans and peasants together formed the backbone of the economy. The\r\nguild system of progression from apprentice to masterworkman still\r\nprevailed and fostered social distinctions among the artisan group.\r\nMerchants occupied a higher rung on the social ladder than did artisans,\r\nprimarily because they did no manual work to earn a living. The\r\ndistinction, however, was not great, and members of the two groups\r\ngenerally associated with each other. The elite group in town, as in the\r\nvillage, was the intelligentsia. Because towns were usually government\r\nadministrative centers and, often, garrison posts, the intelligentsia\r\nwas often quite numerous. It included all the white-collar workers,\r\nprofessionals, and army officers. The town intelligentsia was a\r\nself-contained group whose members mostly associated only with each\r\nother. Within the group, however, distinction was made on the basis of\r\neducation and rank in the government hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe city social structure resembled that of the towns but had additional\r\nstrata reflecting the wider range of economic activity found in the\r\ncity. The most economically and socially disadvantaged were the workers,\r\nincluding industrial and domestic workers. Just above them were petty\r\ngovernment employees, such as janitors, messengers, and railroad men,\r\nwhose standard of living was extremely low but who could look forward to\r\na secure old age with a government pension and who took pride in being\r\ncivil servants. Above these lowest groups were the artisans, shopkeepers\r\nand merchants, and the intelligentsia, as in the social structure of\r\ntowns. A few industrialists ranked among the highest because of their\r\neconomic power, but even they paid respect to university professors for\r\ntheir intellect and to higher government officials for the status and\r\npower connected with their offices.\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists took power in 1944 they set out to destroy the old\r\nsocial system and replace it with one based on Marxist-Leninist\r\nideology. The period of so-called socialist reconstruction that followed\r\nresulted in a general leveling of social strata through the demotion of\r\nformerly privileged groups and the promotion of formerly underprivileged\r\ngroups. Persons of peasant or worker origin received preferential\r\ntreatment in the allocation of housing and of other necessities of life\r\nthat were in short supply, in the appointment to jobs, and in access to\r\nhigher education. At the same time persons of middle-class or upper\r\nclass background were deprived of their housing, removed from key jobs,\r\nand denied educational opportunities for their children through a\r\ndiscriminatory quota system at secondary and higher schools. A policy of\r\nequalization of incomes made little distinction between different levels\r\nof education or skill, thus eliminating material rewards as a basis for\r\nsocial stratification. The small political and economic elite that had\r\ndeveloped from the peasant society before 1944 was decimated and\r\nreplaced by a group of party stalwarts, most of them from lower class or\r\nmiddle-class background, who rose rapidly to the top positions of\r\nadministrative and political power and became the new ruling elite.\r\nMembership in the Bulgarian Communist Party and complete loyalty to the\r\nleadership were the main criteria for occupying any position of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe peasants appreciated some of the material benefits granted by the\r\nnew government, such as educational opportunities for their children and\r\nexpanded industrial employment that offered new outlets for\r\nunderemployed rural youth. As a whole, however, the peasantry bitterly\r\nresented being grouped with workers in the ideological frame of\r\nreference of the new leaders. To the peasant, landless workers who\r\nlacked tradition and security occupied a lower social position than he,\r\nand he saw this grouping together as a debasement of his own status. The\r\nblow to his pride and to his traditional position in society was\r\ncomplete when collectivization deprived him of his precious land. Were\r\nit not for the private farm plot, which allows the peasant to continue\r\non a very small scale his cherished way of life and thereby perpetuate\r\nhis values, the cooperative peasant would be little more than an\r\nagricultural worker.\r\n\r\nIn the restructured Bulgarian society the peasantry, encompassing\r\nroughly 30 percent of the population, forms the bottom of the social\r\npyramid. Although it derives some benefits from the educational, health,\r\nand welfare services instituted by the government, the peasantry is the\r\nforgotten and most disadvantaged segment of the population. Peasants\r\ncontinue to work hard and long for very meager rewards, and they no\r\nlonger have the pride and satisfaction of owning their own land and of\r\nbeing independent.\r\n\r\nThe next social stratum, the industrial working class, has been the\r\nobject of much glorification by the regime and has benefited most by the\r\nsocial measures passed since 1944. In terms of their standard of living\r\nand their social status, workers occupy the lowest level of urban\r\nsociety; however, the educational benefits available to them and the\r\ngrowing job market offer prospects for betterment and advancement. The\r\ngroup has grown more rapidly than any other social class as a result of\r\nthe crash industrialization program and constitute between 40 and 50\r\npercent of the population, as compared to about 29 percent in the\r\nmid-1950s. Most members of the working class are peasants who have left\r\nthe village to find a better life in the growing cities and towns. Some\r\nworkers are members of the former middle or upper classes who have been\r\ndemoted by the new social order. Many members of the small prewar\r\nworking class were propelled upward out of the working class into\r\nmanagerial and administrative positions of industry.\r\n\r\nWithin the working class differentiation is made according to education\r\nand skill, which is reflected in income and prestige. Skilled workers\r\nare still in relatively short supply; therefore, they command\r\nconsiderably higher wages and are likely to receive special housing and\r\nother privileges and inducements from employers. The higher standard of\r\nliving that these material advantages can provide and the higher level\r\nof education required to be skilled workers enhance their prestige in\r\nrelation to the semiskilled and unskilled workers. Workers in certain\r\nindustries, such as mining and heavy industry, are favored regardless of\r\ntheir level of skill. They benefit from the special status assigned to\r\nthese industries in the overall economic plan.\r\n\r\nThe middle level of contemporary society encompasses all persons in\r\nnonmanual occupations who are not members of the ruling elite. It\r\nincludes administrators, managers, professionals, technicians, and all\r\ncategories of white-collar personnel. Next to the working class, this\r\nhas been the fastest growing social group. As a result, most of its\r\nmembers are relatively young, and their social origins represent the\r\nentire spectrum of precommunist society. Within the middle class further\r\ndifferentiation is made in terms of income and prestige between persons\r\nin the upper levels of management and the professions, who have a higher\r\neducation and those in the lower levels of technical and white-collar\r\nemployment, who have only a secondary education. The group as a whole\r\nprobably constitutes almost 20 percent of the population. The relative\r\nsize of the upper and lower levels was not known, although the lower\r\nlevel was probably larger.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the social pyramid is the small ruling elite composed of\r\nthe top leadership of the party, government, security forces, mass\r\norganizations, and the various branches of the economy. The ruling elite\r\nalso includes members of the cultural and intellectual elite who, by\r\nvirtue of their political loyalty and willingness to serve the regime,\r\nshare in the privileges usually reserved to the top leadership. By\r\nlending their talents to the party cause, however, these individuals\r\noften lose some of the prestige and deference traditionally enjoyed by\r\nthe intellectual elite. The main criterion for membership in the ruling\r\nelite is power derived from approved ideological orientation and\r\npolitical manipulation. Most members come from peasant or worker\r\nfamilies and are veterans of the communist movement of the interwar\r\nperiod. Membership in the ruling elite is accompanied by considerable\r\ninsecurity because it is highly dependent on political loyalty and\r\ncorrect interpretation of ideology. A change in official policy can\r\ndeprive a member of his status and of all his privileges.\r\n\r\nSince the end of World War II, Bulgarian society has been extremely\r\nmobile. Industrialization and socialization of the economy have created\r\nthousands of new blue- and white-collar jobs. The attendant increase in\r\neducational opportunities has made it possible for individuals to gain\r\nthe skill and background required to fill these jobs and, thereby, move\r\nup the social ladder. This mobility has been aided by the government's\r\ndetermined effort to reshuffle society by improving the social status\r\nand opportunities of the formerly underprivileged groups and by denying\r\nthem to the formerly privileged ones. Because education has\r\ntraditionally been the main determinant of status, social mobility has\r\nbeen directed by the state through strict control over educational\r\nopportunities. Preference in admission to higher education has been\r\ngiven to children of peasants and workers, children of long-standing\r\nparty members and children of persons killed in the resistance against\r\nthe Germans in World War II (see ch. 6). The political orientation of\r\nthe student himself and his membership in mass organizations such as the\r\nyouth union are also important factors in determining his admission to\r\nan institution of higher learning.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960s there was some evidence that social mobility was\r\nslowing down and that the society was beginning to stabilize into\r\nself-perpetuating social groups. With the slowing of economic growth the\r\nnumber of job openings in the higher levels has been reduced, and the\r\nintelligentsia can satisfy from its own ranks most of the demand for\r\nprofessional and managerial personnel. The social mix of students in\r\nhigher education in the late 1960s was far from representative of the\r\npopulation as a whole--only about 39 percent of the students were from\r\npeasant or worker families, although these groups constituted about 78\r\npercent of the population. In spite of all their admission advantages,\r\nchildren of lower income families have not been able to compete\r\neffectively with those of higher income background. Given education as a\r\nmain channel of mobility, disadvantage in educational opportunities\r\nmeans lower possibility for social advancement. Political loyalty,\r\nhowever, can still override all other considerations and propel a person\r\nup the social ladder. Membership in the party, therefore, continues to\r\nafford considerable advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SOCIAL GROUPS\r\n\r\nBulgarians are not by nature joiners. Formal organizations were of\r\nlittle significance in national life before the 1940s. Although a wide\r\nvariety of groups existed, mostly in the towns and cities, membership\r\nwas generally small and was based on strictly utilitarian\r\nconsiderations. Individuals joined to derive the benefits provided by\r\nthe organization, such as easy credit, professional standing, use of\r\nlibraries and other cultural facilities, or use of sports facilities.\r\nFew members were actively involved in the operation or the activities of\r\nthe organizations to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nBanding together for a common purpose, however, was far from alien to\r\nBulgarian culture; but social organizations and informal groupings that\r\nemerged from such banding together usually were based on kinship or on\r\nclose personal ties. The most important formal traditional organization\r\nwas the _zadruga_ (see The Family, this ch.). In a less formal vein,\r\nwool-cording and spinning bees were important features of rural social\r\nlife before collectivization. In fact, many agricultural activities,\r\nsuch as hoeing and harvesting, were undertaken by groups of friends and\r\nrelatives who joined together to take turns working on each other's\r\nland. This joining together for the accomplishment of necessary tasks\r\nserved an important social, as well as economic, function. While working\r\ntogether in such groups, individuals exchanged ideas, passed on\r\ninformation and, thereby, either reinforced each other's traditional\r\nvalues and mores or helped develop new ones.\r\n\r\nThe cooperative farm of contemporary Bulgaria tries to derive the same\r\neconomic advantages from cooperation as did the traditional work groups.\r\nThe traditional groups, however, were based on a voluntary joining\r\ntogether of friends and relatives, whereas the grouping on the\r\ncooperative farm is forced and impersonal. The spirit of reciprocity,\r\nwhich was so important in the former work groups, has also been lost on\r\nthe cooperative farm, where the peasant works land that, in his eyes,\r\ndoes not belong to him but to an impersonal entity.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with communist practice, the government and the Bulgarian\r\nCommunist Party have introduced a network of mass organizations designed\r\nto serve specific interest groups. Most prominent among them are the\r\ntrade unions, the youth organizations, the women's organizations, and\r\nother member organizations of the Fatherland Front (see ch. 9). Some,\r\nsuch as sports clubs, discussion groups, and cultural clubs of various\r\nkinds, are organized on community or enterprise bases. Intended to cater\r\nto specific interests of individuals, these groups attempt to attract a\r\nlarge percentage of the population into formal organizations that can be\r\nused to promote desired norms and values or undertake specific\r\nactivities. Major emphasis is placed on collectivism, that is, working\r\ntogether as a group rather than as individuals. Structurally, the\r\norganizations are usually divided into small groups that are intended to\r\nact as focal social units. These units engage the attention and loyalty\r\nof an individual and then act on his behalf in relation to other social\r\nunits or larger institutions, much as the family did in traditional\r\nBulgarian society. The political purpose of the mass organizations,\r\nhowever, makes them unattractive to most Bulgarians who have never had\r\nmuch interest in organizational activities. As a result, membership in\r\nmost has been far below desired levels. As was the case with earlier\r\norganizations, Bulgarians join them in order to derive the benefits that\r\nthey afford. Membership in a youth organization or in a trade union, for\r\ninstance, is often required to gain admission to a school or to obtain a\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nLIVING CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a period of austerity during which the population's needs were\r\nneglected in favor of rapid industrialization, the standard of living of\r\nBulgarians began to improve in the early 1960s as more goods and\r\nservices became available. The physical well-being of most of the\r\npopulation has been improving steadily since the end of World War II.\r\nMorbidity has declined noticeably, and declines in the overall death\r\nrate and in the infant mortality rate have resulted in increased life\r\nexpectancy. Electricity and water supplies have become available even in\r\nremote rural areas. In comparison with other Eastern European countries,\r\nhowever, and particularly in comparison with Western Europe, the\r\nstandard of living in Bulgaria in 1973 was low.\r\n\r\nIncreasing exposure to living conditions in the rest of Europe and\r\ngrowing incomes of most Bulgarians created pressures to improve their\r\nown quality of life. In December 1972 the country's leadership proposed\r\nan extensive program for improving the standard of living and satisfying\r\nthe rising expectations of the population over the next ten years (see\r\nch. 12). An important element of the program is the elimination of the\r\ncontinuing disparity in living conditions of the rural and urban\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the socialist ideology of the state, the population is\r\nentitled to free health care and an extensive system of social benefits.\r\nAlthough these have greatly benefited the population in terms of their\r\nphysical and material well-being, their bureaucratic and inefficient\r\nadministration has been a source of considerable frustration and\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\n\r\nDeath and Morbidity\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth in the late 1960s was about sixty-nine years\r\nfor males and seventy-three for females. This was a 35-percent increase\r\nover pre-World War II figures. Although Bulgarians have had a reputation\r\nfor longevity, which has been attributed to their diet, a high infant\r\nmortality rate and a high incidence of morbidity had combined until the\r\nmid-1950s to keep the life expectancy relatively low. Those who survived\r\nto middle age tended to become octogenarians or older; but they were in\r\na minority. Proportionately, however, there were more older people in\r\nBulgaria than in most other countries in the world.\r\n\r\nThe increase in life expectancy since World War II has been brought\r\nabout by a drop in the death rate from 12.2 per 1,000 in 1939 to seven\r\nper 1,000 in 1970 for the urban population and from 13.7 per 1,000 in\r\n1939 to 11.4 per 1,000 in 1970 for the rural population. During the same\r\nperiod, infant mortality dropped from 139 per 1,000 live births to\r\ntwenty-seven per 1,000 live births. In the late 1960s the incidence of\r\ninfant mortality was 39 percent higher among rural infants than among\r\nurban ones. More than one-half of the deaths of children under one year\r\nof age were the result of pneumonia. The second major cause of infant\r\nmortality was birth trauma, despite the fact that 98 percent of the\r\nbirths took place in a public health facility under medical supervision.\r\n\r\nThe three major causes of death in 1970 were diseases of the heart and\r\ncirculatory system, which accounted for 252 per 1,000 deaths;\r\ncerebrovascular diseases, which accounted for 206 per 1,000 deaths; and\r\ncancer, which accounted for 146 per 1,000 deaths. A program of\r\nsystematic treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, which were\r\nonce widespread, has either brought them under control or eradicated\r\nthem completely. The law requires that all cases of contagious diseases\r\nbe registered with the public health service. In 1971 the greatest\r\nincidence was reported for influenza, mumps, chicken pox, dysentery,\r\ninfectious hepatitis, and measles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Public Health Service\r\n\r\nThe public health service, modeled after that of the Soviet Union, is\r\nbased on the premise that the state has the responsibility to provide\r\nfree health care for the population and that such care should be uniform\r\nand readily available. The health service is financed by the state,\r\nsupervised by the Ministry of Public Health, and administered by the\r\npublic health departments of the district people's councils. Free health\r\ncare is available to all citizens; medicine required for outpatient\r\ntreatment, however, must be paid for by the patient.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the health service is the polyclinic, which provides\r\ngeneral and specialized outpatient aid and consultation. Polyclinics may\r\nbe attached to a hospital or may be independent units serving a\r\ndesignated geographic area. A separate network of polyclinics is\r\nattached to industrial mining, transport, and construction enterprises\r\nto serve their workers. Each polyclinic is divided into departments for\r\nthe various specialties in medicine, and each department is staffed by\r\none or more doctors and auxiliary personnel. Not all polyclinics,\r\nhowever, have departments for all the major fields of medicine; many\r\nhave only sections for internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology,\r\npediatrics, and surgery. Patients needing consultation or treatment by\r\nother specialists are referred to the nearest hospital.\r\n\r\nThe health care provided by the polyclinic was under serious attack in\r\nthe early 1970s both from the doctors who work there and from the\r\npatients. The main problem seemed to be overburdening and inefficiency\r\nimposed by the system of health care. One polyclinic in Sofia, for\r\nexample, was responsible for the health care of 70,000 inhabitants of\r\nits area. Its physicians gave routine examinations to prospective\r\nstudents and job applicants, certified the legitimacy of claims for sick\r\nleave, and diagnosed and treated all complaints from the common cold to\r\nthe most serious illness. During four hours each day, patients were seen\r\non a first-come-first-served basis, except in emergencies. Waiting rooms\r\nwere jammed, and people often waited for hours without seeing a doctor\r\nbecause the allotted time for office consultations had expired before\r\ntheir turn came.\r\n\r\nStudies have indicated that one physician sees an average of thirty to\r\nforty patients in the four-hour period of office consultations, and then\r\none-half again as many in a three-hour period of house calls, which\r\noften cover a wide geographic area. The average consultation between\r\ndoctor and patient is six minutes, a time much too short for proper\r\ndiagnosis. The result has been frequently wrong diagnosis and wrong or\r\ninadequate treatment.\r\n\r\nA survey of polyclinic physicians conducted in 1970 revealed that over\r\n50 percent of those surveyed considered the outpatient treatment\r\nprovided by the polyclinic to be ineffective. They blamed poor\r\norganization and procedure in handling patients' needs, which resulted\r\nin the inefficient use of physicians' time, overloading of physicians,\r\nand shortage of drugs and equipment needed for complex treatment. More\r\nthan two-thirds of the physicians questioned indicated that they would\r\nprefer to practice at a hospital or other medical unit and that they\r\nplanned to leave the polyclinic as soon as another opportunity was\r\navailable. The physicians recommended that their work schedule and\r\nmethod of handling patients be revised to make the system more\r\nefficient; that social workers be assigned to polyclinics to handle some\r\nof the patients' social problems that aggravated their medical problems;\r\nthat polyclinic doctors be given more specialized training in rapid\r\ndiagnosis and other skills required by them and not by hospital\r\nphysicians; and that the remuneration of polyclinic physicians be\r\nbrought in line with their arduous assignment.\r\n\r\nThe patient's response to the inadequacy and inefficiency of polyclinic\r\nhealth care has been to seek out a physician with a private practice and\r\npay the necessary fee. Approximately one-fourth of the polyclinic\r\nphysicians have a private practice during nonduty hours, as do almost\r\nall specialists. By consulting a private physician rather than the free\r\npolyclinic, the patient can choose his own doctor and establish a\r\npersonal relationship with him, hoping to develop confidence and receive\r\nmore effective treatment.\r\n\r\nThe outpatient work of the polyclinics is supplemented by a network of\r\nspecial dispensaries that provide long-term care for persons suffering\r\nfrom tuberculosis, venereal disease, tumors and psychoneurotic\r\ndisturbances. The sixty-one dispensaries in 1971 also had a total of\r\n3,670 beds for inpatient care.\r\n\r\nA network of hospitals provides inpatient treatment and specialized\r\ndiagnostic and clinical facilities. All hospitals are also teaching\r\ncenters for physicians, nurses, and auxiliary medical personnel. In 1971\r\nthere were 195 hospitals throughout the country, at least one in each\r\ndistrict. Certain districts, however, were inadequately equipped with\r\nhospital facilities. The total number of beds was 57,053, or 7.6 beds\r\nper 1,000 inhabitants. One hundred and fifty-four of the hospitals, with\r\na total of 47,839 beds, were general hospitals. There were also fifteen\r\nspecial tuberculosis hospitals and fifteen psychoneurological hospitals\r\nwith a total of slightly over 3,000 beds in each category; five\r\npediatric hospitals with a total of 480 beds; four obstetric and\r\ngynecological hospitals with a total of 740 beds; one hospital for\r\ninfectious diseases; and one for orthopedic and plastic surgery. In\r\naddition to these district-supported hospitals, the central government\r\noperated six hospitals with a total bed capacity of 1,036 in connection\r\nwith the special medical research institutes. Extended care and physical\r\ntherapy for patients suffering from chronic ailments were offered by 182\r\nsanatoriums and health spas with a total bed capacity of 16,104.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) envisages increasing the number of\r\nhospital beds to 8.4 per 1,000 inhabitants and focusing on those areas\r\nof the country that are underserved. An increase in operating funds for\r\nthe hospitals is to be channeled mostly into improving plant and\r\nequipment. Although most hospitals suffer from poor or outmoded plant\r\nand equipment, they also suffer seriously from a shortage of staff,\r\nparticularly of nurses and auxiliary medical personnel. The plan states\r\nspecifically that alleviation of that shortage will have to be delayed.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 the country had a total of 16,183 physicians, 1.9 for every\r\n1,000 inhabitants. The number of physicians had more than doubled in the\r\ntwenty years since 1952; most of them, therefore, were between the ages\r\nof twenty-five and forty-five. The number of other medical personnel had\r\nexpanded along the same lines. In 1971 there were 2,464 pharmacists;\r\n26,381 nurses; 6,016 midwives; and 5,012 feldshers. Feldshers are\r\nparamedics trained to perform a variety of medical functions, including\r\nsimple surgery, in the absence of a fully qualified physician. Many\r\nrural health centers are in the charge of feldshers and receive periodic\r\nvisits from specialized physicians.\r\n\r\nPhysicians and auxiliary medical personnel are all employed by the state\r\nin the national health service. They are classed as nonproductive\r\nworkers, therefore their salary scales are lower than those for\r\nproductive workers. This has been causing a great deal of\r\ndissatisfaction and is the principal reason for the serious shortage of\r\nmedical personnel. One Bulgarian newspaper in 1971 reported the case of\r\na hospital administrator trying to recruit women streetcleaners to fill\r\nthe many vacancies for nurses and aides in the hospital. The\r\nstreetcleaners refused because their wages and working conditions were\r\nbetter than those for the more highly skilled positions in the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURES\r\n\r\nCost of Living\r\n\r\nIncomes and retail prices are controlled by the government and set in\r\naccordance with the overall economic plan. The cost of living,\r\ntherefore, is also controlled and has been relatively stable. Several\r\nincreases in the minimum wage during the 1960s were paralleled by price\r\nincreases for some of the essential commodities and services. In 1973\r\nthe minimum monthly wage was raised to 80 leva per month (for value of\r\nthe lev--see Glossary), and basic wages for the lowest categories of\r\nworkers and employees were also raised to bring them into line with\r\nwages in comparable kinds of work. At the same time, prices of certain\r\nfoods were reduced, whereas prices of some other essential goods were\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nAlthough the incomes of most Bulgarians have generally kept pace with\r\nthe rise in the cost of living, a chronic scarcity of consumer goods and\r\nservices and periodic food shortages have forced a comparatively low\r\nstandard of living on the population. As in other communist countries,\r\nthe consumer industry has been neglected in favor of other branches of\r\nthe economy. Even after the government began to place greater emphasis\r\non the production of consumer goods in the 1960s, rising demand\r\noutstripped production capabilities. Even the basic needs of the\r\npopulation often could not be met because of poor planning or the\r\ninflexibility of the central planning system, which does not react\r\neffectively to changing market conditions. It is not uncommon to have\r\nexcessive inventories of certain sizes of clothing or footwear while\r\nother sizes are in short supply. Retail outlets are either unwilling or\r\nunable to replenish their supplies of missing sizes until the overall\r\nstock of the item is almost depleted, regardless of consumer demand.\r\n\r\nThe government has for some time indicated concern over the low standard\r\nof living in Bulgaria as compared with other Eastern European countries.\r\nOne of the aims of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is to increase production of\r\nconsumer goods and meet the needs and rising demands of the population.\r\nLimited production capacity, however, and shortages of certain raw\r\nmaterials will seriously restrict the extent of possible improvements.\r\n\r\nIn December 1972 the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party\r\nheld a special plenum on improving the standard of living of the people.\r\nThis unprecedented move showed the importance that the leadership was\r\nattaching to this subject. In an extensive report to the plenum, party\r\nchief Todor Zhivkov presented a far-reaching program of steps to be\r\ntaken, starting in 1973, to improve the standard of living. To implement\r\nthe decisions of the plenum over the long run, the Commission on the\r\nLiving Standard was established under prominent Bulgarian Communist\r\nParty (BKP--see Glossary) leadership.\r\n\r\nAs envisaged by the plenum, the standard of living will be raised by\r\npursuing a three-pronged policy: gradually increasing wages; keeping\r\nprices stable; and making available an adequate supply of consumer goods\r\nand services, including luxury goods and services to satisfy the demand\r\nof those who are willing to pay the higher price. In the past, luxury\r\ngoods and services have been considered superfluous and undesirable in\r\nan egalitarian socialist country. Higher incomes and exposure to the\r\nliving standards in other Eastern European and Western European\r\ncountries, however, have created pressure for more than just the\r\nsatisfaction of basic needs. According to some government officials,\r\nBulgarians are no longer satisfied with just any washing machine or\r\nelectric appliance; they want the latest automatic model and are willing\r\nto pay for it.\r\n\r\nIn the program for increasing wages, special attention will be paid to\r\nnarrowing the gap between incomes of cooperative peasants and those of\r\nworkers. In the mid-1950s a cooperative peasant's income was only 60\r\npercent of a worker's income. By 1971 the peasant's income had increased\r\nto 85 percent of that of a worker, but this amount was still considered\r\ntoo low by the government. To accelerate the growth of peasants'\r\nincomes, a nontaxable minimum income was to be introduced in 1973, and\r\nthe same system of income tax was to cover both peasants and workers.\r\nThe system of remuneration on cooperative farms was to be made the same\r\nas that on state farms, where agricultural workers are classed as\r\nworkers, not as farmers. Fringe benefits, such as pensions and\r\nsupplements for children, were also to be brought into line with those\r\nof workers by 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumption\r\n\r\nAccording to official figures, consumption has grown steadily since the\r\nearly 1960s, in spite of continued shortages of some goods. As incomes\r\nrose and consumer goods and services became more readily available, a\r\ngreater percentage of household budgets was being spent on them. All\r\nsegments of the population spent a greater share of their income in 1971\r\non household equipment and on cultural and educational pursuits, which\r\nincluded such durable goods as household appliances and radios and\r\ntelevision sets, than they did in 1962. Changes in proportionate\r\nexpenditures for other nonessentials during the 1960s reflected the\r\nincome differences and taste preferences of the different social\r\ncategories as well as their rural or urban residence.\r\n\r\nThe largest share of consumer expenditures in 1971 went for food,\r\nranging from 42.5 percent of total expenditures for peasants to 38.8\r\npercent of total expenditures for white-collar workers (see table 3).\r\nIn calculating expenditures for food, the value of food production for\r\npersonal consumption was included. The relative share of expenditures on\r\nfood has been dropping since 1962. At the same time, the quality of the\r\ndiet for all population groups has improved.\r\n\r\n_Table 3.

The share\r\nof the budget spent on clothing has dropped since 1962.\r\n\r\nThe relative share of expenditures for housing went down between 1962\r\nand 1971 for the two lower income groups, who spent almost the same\r\nproportion of their budget for that purpose. The higher income\r\nwhite-collar group, however, spent over 3 percent more on housing in\r\n1971 than it did in 1962. This group has been investing in its own\r\nprivate housing rather than living in state- or industry-supplied\r\nhousing. Expenditures for household furnishings and equipment were\r\napproximately the same for all segments of the population in 1971. They\r\noccupied a greater share of the household budget than in 1962,\r\nparticularly among blue-collar workers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to devoting a considerably higher portion of their budget to\r\nhousing than other social groups, white-collar workers also devote more\r\nof their budget to culture and entertainment and to health and hygiene.\r\nThis is clearly a reflection of more sophisticated tastes and a higher\r\nstandard of living. The life-style of this group includes regular\r\nattendance at the theater, operas, and concerts; the purchase of books\r\nand records; and a higher education for their children. This, also, is\r\nthe group that prefers to consult a private physician, who sets his own\r\nrates, rather than to use the free public clinic.\r\n\r\nRelative expenditures for communication and transportation services have\r\nremained stable over the years. They vary by population group, consuming\r\na greater portion of the budget as one rises on the social ladder. The\r\nproportionately higher expenditures of blue- and white-collar workers\r\nare probably due to the expense of commuting to and from a job. The even\r\nhigher share of such expenditures in the budgets of white-collar workers\r\nis attributable to private telephones and travel.\r\n\r\nThe greatest variation in consumption patterns between the different\r\npopulation groups is evident in the proportion of expenditures devoted\r\nto other than the enumerated categories. Although there is no indication\r\nin the statistical material as to what kind of expenditures are\r\nincluded, this entry must certainly include expenses incurred in the\r\ncultivation of private plots and the raising of animals in the private\r\nsector for domestic consumption and expenses incurred in providing\r\nprivate services. Therefore, these expenditures take a high share of the\r\ntotal expenditures of peasants and workers.\r\n\r\nDespite expanding consumption, neither the government nor the population\r\nis satisfied with the supply and quality of the goods and services\r\navailable. Some items, such as meat, housewares, furniture, building\r\nmaterials, and various kinds of clothing and knitwear, are in chronic\r\nshort supply. Other items, such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy\r\nproducts, are subject to periodic shortages. In addition, the quality\r\nand selection of many goods do not meet the desired levels. An official\r\ndocument published in 1972 decried the common practice of producing\r\nhigh-quality goods for export and lower quality goods for the domestic\r\nmarket. The same document also called for changing export priorities so\r\nthat the domestic needs could be met before scarce goods were exported.\r\n\r\nAnother factor limiting the satisfaction of demands for goods and\r\nservices has been the small size and inefficiency of the domestic trade\r\nnetwork and of the service industry. Retail outlets are state owned and\r\nhave received very low priority in the allocation of funds. As a result,\r\nthey are too few in number and are seriously understaffed, making\r\nshopping a time-consuming and frustrating activity. Stores are reluctant\r\nto stock new styles in response to consumer demands until their old\r\nstocks have been almost completely depleted. High-quality and specialty\r\nitems are usually available only from private craftsmen at very high\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nPrivate craftsmen and artisans provide virtually the only service\r\nnetwork in the country. The service sector of the economy has been\r\nconsidered as nonessential and therefore has been neglected by the state\r\n(see ch. 12). In order to fill the gap thus created, the government\r\nstarted in the mid-1960s to encourage private individuals to provide\r\nthe needed services. Many of these people are regularly employed\r\nartisans and craftsmen in industry who provide specialized services\r\nduring their spare time. Others are pensioners or unemployed. Because\r\nthey are in great demand, they can set their own prices, and many are in\r\nthe highest income groups. The government has attempted to keep their\r\nearnings under control through taxes and has restricted their activities\r\nby other administrative measures, but it has made no effort to eliminate\r\ntheir services.\r\n\r\nIn the report issued by the special plenum on living conditions held by\r\nthe Central Committee in December 1972, a comparison was made of actual\r\nconsumption in 1970, desired consumption levels during the next decade,\r\nand consumption standards developed by government scientific institutes.\r\nIn most cases the actual levels were far below the standards (see table\r\n4).\r\n\r\n_Table 4.

Great numbers of workers have\r\nleft the villages over the years to find employment in the rapidly\r\nexpanding industrial centers, but housing construction has not kept pace\r\nwith this migration. During the early years of communist rule, priority\r\nin the allocation of scarce building materials and funds was given to\r\nthe building of new plants and other industrial installations rather\r\nthan to new housing. In the 1960s only between 3 and 6 percent of the\r\ngross national income was invested in housing construction as compared\r\nwith 20 percent or more in most Western European countries. Bulgaria has\r\nhad the lowest housing investment among the communist countries of\r\nEastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 the Politburo and the Council of Ministers adopted a special\r\nprogram for the solution of the housing problem within the next ten to\r\nfifteen years. The program stated that the aim of the BKP was to enable\r\nevery family to have its own apartment, and every member of the family\r\nhis own room. In 1972 there were some 250,000 more urban families than\r\nthere were housing units.\r\n\r\nAggravating the housing shortage in the early 1970s was an accelerating\r\ndeterioration of old buildings. Money and materials for maintenance of\r\nexisting structures have been even scarcer than for new buildings. In\r\naddition, many of the postwar apartment buildings were put up hastily,\r\nusing inferior materials and workmanship, and soon turned into crumbling\r\nslums.\r\n\r\nIn order to spur housing construction without imposing too great a\r\nburden on the state budget, the government was forced to abandon its\r\nintention of providing low-rent housing for everyone. Instead, it has\r\nencouraged the population to invest in its own housing. As a result,\r\nspecial savings accounts for the purchase of private housing have grown\r\nat a more rapid rate than regular savings accounts. During the 1968-70\r\nperiod approximately one-third of the new housing units made available\r\nwere financed entirely by state funds, another one-third were financed\r\nentirely by private funds, and the last one-third were financed by\r\nprivate funds with the aid of loans from state sources. State\r\nenterprises are instructed to grant their employees interest-free,\r\nfifteen-year mortgages for the purchase of an apartment or house. Up to\r\n4,000 leva can be borrowed for this purpose in urban areas and up to\r\n3,000 leva in rural areas. This, however, covers less than one-half of\r\nthe cost of a two-room apartment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the increasing reliance on tenant-financed housing is helping\r\nto reduce the overall housing shortage, it has meant that most new\r\nhousing units are built for the higher income groups. Cooperative\r\napartments and private houses require a substantial initial investment\r\nand the assumption of a mortgage, which are beyond the means of most\r\nblue-collar and low-income white-collar workers. These groups continue\r\nto rely on state-financed or industry-financed low-rent housing, which\r\nusually has long waiting lists of prospective tenants. In order to free\r\nmore of the low-rent housing for those who cannot pay for a private\r\nhome, persons owning a second home or intending to build one are being\r\nasked to vacate their state-supplied housing.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the per capita area of usable housing space was 124 square feet.\r\nNew dwelling units constructed under the Sixth Five-Year Plan were to\r\nhave an average of 857 square feet each; those constructed during the\r\nfollowing Seventh Five-Year Plan (1976-80) will have an average of 911\r\nsquare feet each. Inasmuch as possible, all new housing units\r\nconstructed before 1975 will be equipped with running water,\r\nelectricity, sewage disposal facilities, and central heat. After 1976\r\nsuch amenities will be mandatory. In the mid-1960s, the latest date\r\navailable, 30.7 percent of all housing units had running water, 94.7\r\npercent had electricity, 32.7 percent had sewage disposal facilities,\r\nand 1.5 percent had central heat. The availability of these amenities in\r\nhousing units varied a great deal among the different social groups of\r\nthe population (see table 5).\r\n\r\n_Table 5.

Most of these are\r\nadministered by the trade unions, but pensions are under the\r\njurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. They are financed by the\r\ncentral government and by contributions from the employers based on a\r\npercentage of gross salaries and wages paid.\r\n\r\nAll workers are entitled to paid sick leave after three months' service.\r\nIn the case of accidents at work, there is no waiting period. Lump-sum\r\ncompensation for temporary disablement because of an accident at work\r\nranges in amount, depending on severity of injury and length of\r\nservice. During the period of disablement, the worker is entitled to\r\nbenefits ranging from 30 to 100 percent of his wage, depending on the\r\nseverity of the disablement and on his income. Prolonged or permanent\r\ndisability entitles the worker to a pension.\r\n\r\nOld-age pensions are based on the years of service and kind of work\r\nperformed. The pensionable age is fifty-five for women and sixty for\r\nmen, but earlier retirement is possible for certain categories of work.\r\nPension payments range from 55 to 80 percent of wages based on a scale\r\ncovering the last five years of employment or, in some cases, three out\r\nof the last five years. Higher rates are paid for work years past the\r\nusual retirement age. Pensions are payable to dependents after the death\r\nof the pensioner. Dependents also receive life insurance payments.\r\nCooperative farm members are entitled to pensions after twenty years of\r\nwork for women and twenty-five years of work for men provided they\r\nworked 100 to 135 days each year. In 1972 it was suggested that 200 to\r\n250 days of work per year should be required for pensions in exchange\r\nfor higher pension payments to cooperative farm members.\r\n\r\nPensions are collectible even if a person continues working. This system\r\nwas criticized by Zhivkov in late 1972. He suggested that persons who\r\ncontinued to work after being eligible for a pension should be\r\nencouraged to do so without drawing a pension but should, instead,\r\naccumulate additional increments to their pension for each year worked.\r\n\r\nIn addition to old-age pensions there are pensions for special merit\r\npayable to persons who have made an exceptional contribution to national\r\nlife and national pensions payable to fighters against fascism and\r\ncapitalism. All minimum pension payments were increased in 1972.\r\n\r\nUnder new provisions announced in March 1973, employed women will be\r\nentitled to four months of fully paid maternity leave and six months of\r\nleave at minimum wages for the first child; five and seven months,\r\nrespectively, for the second child; six and eight months for the third\r\nchild; and four and six months for each subsequent child. Mothers who\r\nare students or who do not work for some valid reason will receive\r\nminimum wages for corresponding periods. Mothers of children under the\r\nage of ten are entitled to special annual leave. All mothers receive a\r\ncash payment at the birth of a child; the payments are sharply\r\ndifferentiated to encourage larger families. In early 1973 the payments\r\nwere 20 leva for the first child, 200 leva for the second child, and 500\r\nleva for the third child. It was planned, however to raise these\r\npayments to 100 leva, 250 leva, and 500 leva, respectively.\r\n\r\nAnother inducement for larger families is a system of monthly family\r\nallowance payments for children up to the age of sixteen or until they\r\ncomplete secondary school. Allowances are payable to all families\r\nregardless of whether or not the parents work. A variety of other social\r\nassistance benefits are available to indigents, persons disabled from\r\nchildhood, orphans, and the aged with no income.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK AND LEISURE\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the country was in the process of shifting from a\r\nforty-six-hour, six-day workweek to a 42.5-hour, five-day workweek. The\r\ntransition was being carried out district by district according to a set\r\nschedule. It was to be completed by 1975. Persons working in\r\nagriculture, education, and the health service, however, were to\r\ncontinue to work their forty-six hour workweek, except where the actual\r\nwork involved was adaptable to a reduced workweek.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in working hours had been a much debated subject for\r\nseveral years. It was first promised by the government in 1968, but its\r\nimplementation has been slow because it is predicated on the same level\r\nof productivity and output by each enterprise as before implementation.\r\nPressure for reduced working hours has been strong because most\r\nBulgarians have very little time for genuine leisure in their daily\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe lack of time for genuine leisure is the result not only of long\r\nworking hours but also of an inadequate trade and service network, a\r\nshortage of time-saving household equipment, and an excessive\r\nbureaucracy. All the daily chores, such as housekeeping, shopping, and\r\nattending to other personal or family matters, are time consuming and\r\ncumbersome. Studies have shown that all persons over the age of six\r\ndevote an average of four hours out of every twenty-four to housework\r\nalone. The national leadership feels this is excessive and has proposed\r\nmeasures to develop the service sector.\r\n\r\nThe favorite leisure-time activity of young and old, urban and rural\r\nBulgarians is to get together with friends for informal socializing. Men\r\ncongregate at the neighborhood tavern or their favorite café to drink\r\nplum brandy or wine, play cards, and talk about the latest news. Women\r\ngather to gossip at each other's homes, at the village pump, or at the\r\nneighborhood playground or park. The evening promenade is an important\r\ndiversion for all ages and social groups. Walking back and forth at some\r\ndesignated public thoroughfare in small groups of friends or relatives,\r\npeople greet each other and exchange pleasantries.\r\n\r\nSports are a major form of recreation for young people. Soccer is the\r\nnational sport, and the matches of major teams are followed with great\r\ninterest. Hiking and picnic excursions are popular among city dwellers\r\nwho like to get out into the country to enjoy the beauty and\r\ntranquillity of nature. In towns and cities, the theater, operas,\r\nconcerts, and other cultural activities are popular leisure-time\r\ndiversions. The cinema is extremely popular in both town and village,\r\nalthough increasing television viewing has been reducing cinema\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sports, young people spend much of their leisure time\r\nlistening to popular music and also dancing. In fact, they are\r\nperiodically reprimanded by the BKP leadership for spending too much of\r\ntheir time in leisure activities and not enough in socially useful\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe educational system in Bulgaria, as in the Balkans generally, began\r\nto develop in a real sense only in the nineteenth century, principally\r\nbecause Bulgaria had been under Turkish rule for 500 years. As education\r\nwas of little concern to the Turks and an educated Bulgarian population\r\nwould only represent a threat to their regime, the advancement of a\r\nformal educational system was either openly repressed or neglected by\r\nthe Turks. As a result, the literacy rate in Bulgaria was one of the\r\nlowest in Europe at the time of liberation in 1878. During the six\r\ndecades between liberation and World War II, the educational system had\r\nmade great progress in providing basic education to young people, but\r\nthere remained a hard core of illiterates in the adult population. After\r\nthe Communists took over in 1944, a massive drive in adult education\r\nvirtually eliminated the problem of illiteracy within a decade.\r\n\r\nThe educational system under the Communists was essentially patterned on\r\nthat of the Soviet Union, and the desire on the part of Bulgarian\r\nauthorities to stay within that pattern brought about a general\r\ncautiousness as they restructured the system to make it coincide with\r\nthe newly imposed ideology. Although educational reforms have been\r\nenacted with great frequency, they have often dealt with matters of form\r\nrather than of substance. The basic adherence to Soviet guidelines has\r\nremained intact throughout the years of communist rule.\r\n\r\nAs in most Eastern European countries, the major objectives of the\r\nBulgarian educational system have been premised on both ideological\r\nissues and the demands of the national economy. One of the primary goals\r\nof the system--both stated and implicit--is the production of the ideal\r\ncommunist citizen who will work for the realization of \"socialist\r\nconstruction\" and the betterment of the socialist society. A second\r\nmajor premise of the system is that the demands of the economy must be\r\nmet; this goal is to be achieved by educating skilled personnel to fill\r\nthe specific needs of its various sectors. Because of the trend toward\r\nindustrialization that obtains in all communist countries, a corollary\r\npolicy is that the study of science and technology must be emphasized\r\nover the study of the humanities.\r\n\r\nAccording to established principles, therefore, certain policies are\r\ncarried out in the process of education. People of worker or peasant\r\norigin, who the Communists perceive as having been deprived of their\r\nbasic rights to an education in the past, are allowed to enter the\r\nhigher levels of the educational system without the usual prerequisite\r\nexamination if the necessary places are available. They generally\r\nrepresent between 30 and 40 percent of the total higher education\r\npopulation as compared with 80 percent of the population as a whole.\r\n\r\nCertain communist principles form the backbone of the curriculum. Work\r\nis perceived to be an integral part of education as are directed\r\nextracurricular activities, and a sizable percentage of formal education\r\nis allotted for practical and vocational training. Religious education,\r\nwhich was a legacy from the past, has been dismissed as superstitious\r\nand archaic, and virtually all religious schools have been banned. The\r\ncurriculum from the earliest years of schooling to the upper levels of\r\nhigher education is filled with such courses as Marxism-Leninism, the\r\nhistory of the communist party of the Soviet Union, and the history of\r\nthe Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary).\r\n\r\nUnder the many and varied educational reforms legislated under the\r\nCommunists, the pendulum has swung between relative emphasis on science\r\nand technology on the one hand and the humanities on the other. Although\r\noverall emphasis has always been on the sciences, that emphasis has\r\nincreased and decreased at various times since the communist takeover.\r\nBetween 1944 and 1948, for example, there was little overall emphasis on\r\ntechnology in the curriculum. Between 1948 and 1967, however, these\r\nsubjects were emphasized to a large degree. Beginning in 1967 some\r\nweight was again placed on the humanities. As of 1973 there had been\r\nsome manifestation of rededication to technology and science, but the\r\nlatest proposed reform regarding secondary education represented a\r\ndesire on the part of the government to fuse general education--which of\r\ncourse includes the humanities--and specialized training into one\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 problems inherent in the educational system of Bulgaria\r\ncontinued to exist. One of the most serious was the inadequacy of funds\r\nfor education generally but particularly for higher education where the\r\nneed was the greatest. Another problem was that of overcrowding.\r\nAlthough there was virtually no problem of teacher shortage, there were\r\nfar too many students in proportion to the number of schools. A third\r\nproblem lay in the area of foreign student exchange where relatively few\r\nforeign students studied in Bulgarian universities and institutes and\r\nfew Bulgarian students were allowed to study abroad. Another problem on\r\nthe higher educational level was the discrepancy between students'\r\npreference regarding their fields of specialization and government\r\ndictates in this area. Although many students at the university level\r\nwere interested in the arts and social sciences, the government, feeling\r\nthe weight of the economy's demands, very often preempted their choices\r\nand allocated many more places to the sciences than to the arts. The\r\nmost serious problem, however, in terms of higher education, was that\r\nowing to a shortage of places at the university level only 20 percent of\r\nthe secondary students who applied for admission were accepted. This\r\nshortage of places in higher education, coupled with the fact that\r\nextremely few Bulgarian students were permitted to study abroad, meant\r\nthat a large proportion of potential students capable of serious work\r\nwere turned away from higher education altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nUntil the late eighteenth century education made virtually no progress\r\nin the country. Although schools did exist during the period of Turkish\r\nrule, the Turks had no interest in furthering education among their\r\nsubjects, except insofar as it would benefit themselves. From the\r\nfourteenth through the seventeenth centuries education remained at a\r\nstandstill. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Turks\r\nallowed the Greek Orthodox Church to become predominant among Christians\r\nin the area, and an intense hellenization campaign ensued with the\r\nseeming purpose of assimilating the Bulgarians as a people into the\r\nGreek society that surrounded them. The campaign, which was particularly\r\nvirulent in the 1750s, was successful in the schools, and the Bulgarian\r\nlanguage and customs were supplanted by those of the Greek.\r\n\r\nBy the late eighteenth century, however, a national revival grew in\r\nforce, stimulated in large part by Father Paisi, a monk who wrote the\r\nfirst Bulgarian history, _The Slav-Bulgarian History_. This work and\r\nFather Paisi's teachings provided an incentive for the development of\r\neducation in the country. From 1762 until liberation from Turkish rule\r\nin 1878, education made great strides. As the churches began to throw\r\noff the domination of the Greek Orthodox Church, more church schools\r\nstaffed by monks and priests were established within the Bulgarian\r\nOrthodox Church framework.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Greek educational system still predominated in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century, complemented by a rising move toward the\r\nestablishment of Bulgarian Orthodox Church schools, a movement toward\r\nsecular education was initiated at this time. Secular subjects were\r\nintroduced in the church schools, and communal schools were established.\r\nBy 1834 the first primer in Bulgarian was written, based on a western\r\nEuropean model, which established the basis for secondary education. In\r\n1835 a wealthy merchant founded the first Bulgarian high school, and\r\nwithin the next ten years some fifty schools had been established.\r\n\r\nAt the time of liberation, however, over 90 percent of the population\r\nover school age was still illiterate. Only a small proportion--some 30\r\npercent--of school-age children, those from seven to fourteen years of\r\nage, were actually attending schools. After the Turnovo Constitution\r\n(1879), however, which was enacted shortly after liberation, the\r\neducational system was revitalized (see ch. 8). Elementary education\r\nwas made both free and compulsory. The state, the monarchy, and private\r\nindividuals contributed to the goal of making education as nearly\r\nuniversal as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the three-year compulsory elementary school was introduced. By\r\n1880 the period of compulsory education had been extended to four years.\r\nIn 1888 the University of Sofia was founded. The university initially\r\nhad seven faculties: history and philosophy; physics and mathematics;\r\nlaw; medicine; agronomy; theology; and veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the school system, which covered a twelve-year period, consisted\r\nof a four-year elementary school for children aged seven to eleven, a\r\nthree-year _progymnasium_ for children from eleven to fourteen, and a\r\nfive-year gymnasium for children from fourteen to eighteen. This system\r\ncontinued with only slight modification until the Communists took over\r\nin 1944. Also by 1910 both professional and vocational schools had been\r\nestablished providing a relatively high quality of education in such\r\nfields as agriculture, engineering, theology, commerce, art, and music.\r\nAlthough there were many students of higher education at the University\r\nof Sofia, about 10,000 students annually attended foreign universities,\r\nprincipally in Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\nBy the end of World War I, many villages that had more than twenty\r\nfamilies had their own primary school. Larger settlements in more urban\r\nareas often had their own _progymnasia_ and gymnasiums. In towns that\r\nhad 20,000 or more citizens, there were kindergartens for children from\r\nthree to seven years of age. Both religious and linguistic minorities\r\nhad their own schools, which functioned within the public school system.\r\nForeign schools coexisted with the public school system. Although the\r\ncurricula of the foreign schools were similar to those of the public\r\nsecondary schools, subjects were taught in western European languages,\r\nforming a link between Bulgaria and the West.\r\n\r\nBy 1921 a three-tiered system of education--consisting of the four-year\r\nelementary school, the three-year _progymnasium_, and the five-year\r\ngymnasium--became officially compulsory in the first two stages. Many\r\nchildren failed to attend school, however, and many villages, despite\r\nthe official policy, were without school facilities. The entire\r\neducational system was controlled by the government through the Ministry\r\nof Public Education, which regulated the contents of texts and courses\r\nand the administration of exams. The model for the educational system\r\nwas essentially European, with a particularly strong emphasis on German\r\nand Russian patterns.\r\n\r\nIn 1921 the Law of Public Instruction brought an increase in emphasis on\r\nvocational training. Orders were issued to bring about a transition to\r\n\"vocational education and respect for labor.\" Eventually, schoolchildren\r\nwere forced to spend two weeks of their studies in \"compulsory labor,\"\r\na concept that was the precursor of the Bulgarian communist philosophy\r\nof the integration of work with education. During this period the\r\nstudents worked in such projects as cleaning school facilities, binding\r\ntexts, and cultivating school gardens.\r\n\r\nIn 1934 a so-called modern school was established to give the student an\r\nalternative to the academically and socially elitist gymnasium, but\r\nthere were still a number of deficiencies in the Bulgarian educational\r\nsystem. The literacy rate had greatly increased, but between 20 and 30\r\npercent of the population was still illiterate. Although schooling was\r\nofficially compulsory, it was in fact inaccessible in smaller villages,\r\nand many school-age children were not able to attend. Humanities were\r\nemphasized to the virtual exclusion of technical-vocational subjects,\r\nwhich were developed to only a very slight degree. Only one of five\r\nsecondary students studied technical subjects. Adult education was\r\nvirtually nonexistent.\r\n\r\nIn 1937 there were eight institutions of higher education in addition to\r\nthe University of Sofia, the country's leading educational facility. Six\r\nof these--the Free University, the Academy of Art, the Academy of Music,\r\nthe Military Academy, the Theological Seminary, and the School of\r\nPhysical Education--were also located in Sofia. The remaining two were\r\nbusiness schools located in Varna and Svishtov. A large number of\r\nBulgarian students also chose to continue their education abroad. One of\r\nthe major problems at the time concerned the absorption of graduates\r\ninto the various fields for which they were eligible. The country was\r\nstill predominantly agricultural, and there were simply too few\r\npositions available for the annual influx of graduates, a situation that\r\ncaused alienation and disaffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNIST EDUCATIONAL POLICIES\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists came to power in 1944 they were determined to change\r\nthe system of education in Bulgaria. Not only did they seek to eradicate\r\ncertain elements--such as religion and social elitism--from the\r\neducational system, but they also were determined to make education\r\nuniversal and, insofar as possible, to create an entirely literate\r\nsociety. As the educational system developed under communist tutelage,\r\nhowever, governmental statements on the subject displayed an increasing\r\ntendency to link the system with ideology and principles to the point\r\nwhere the ultimate goal was the creation of the ideal Communist.\r\n\r\nWhen the 1947 Constitution was formulated, it established universality\r\nand state control over the school system as the two main policies of\r\neducation. It stated: \"Every citizen has the right to education.\r\nEducation is secular, democratic and progressive in spirit. Ethnic\r\nminorities have the right to instruction in their mother tongue; they\r\nalso have the right to develop their national culture, although study of\r\nthe Bulgarian language is compulsory.... Schools belong to the State.\r\nPrivate schools can be established only by the passage of a law; such\r\nschools are placed under State control....\"\r\n\r\nStatements in subsequent constitutions indicated an increased emphasis\r\non the socialist content of education and its close ties with the Soviet\r\nmodel on which it was based. In 1949 the government issued a statement\r\ndeclaring that education would be \"in the spirit of socialism,\r\nproletarian internationalism, and indissoluble brotherly friendship with\r\nthe Soviet Union.\" Two years later the government stated that \"the\r\npeople's school is a powerful weapon in the hands of the Communist Party\r\nand the people's democratic state for education and Communist\r\nindoctrination of the people.\" In the present-day period both Todor\r\nZhivkov, who is the first secretary of the party, and the minister of\r\nnational education (formerly known as the minister of public education)\r\nhave reinforced the purpose and function of education in a socialist\r\nsociety. In 1966 the minister of national education stated: \"The work of\r\nthe school, its major and minor tasks--everything for which it\r\nexists--must be subordinated to its fundamental objective: training and\r\neducating the new man of communist society.\"\r\n\r\nCertain distinctive principles form the basis for communist policies of\r\neducation in Bulgaria. Chief among these is the close patterning of the\r\nsystem on the Soviet model. For this reason Bulgaria tends to be\r\nsomewhat cautious in its approach to education and reluctant to make\r\nsweeping reforms unless the Soviets provide a model for change.\r\n\r\nThe principle of a universally accessible system of education has top\r\npriority, and in fact the near-universal nature of education in Bulgaria\r\nhas brought about almost complete literacy. Whereas before 1944 many\r\nBulgarians had never attended school, in mid-1973 almost every Bulgarian\r\nwas able to attend some form of school. In some areas of the educational\r\nsystem, particularly in institutions of higher education, the number of\r\nstudents has increased as much as eightfold.\r\n\r\nAnother principle of communist education in Bulgaria is the concept of\r\nsocially useful work, which must be performed by all students at all\r\nlevels of education. The principle of work in education is initiated at\r\nthe very lowest levels of the system; it progresses into increasingly\r\nlonger periods as the student advances in the school system. In the\r\nhigher grades, students work for significant periods of time in\r\nagriculture, industry, and construction. In the higher levels of\r\neducation the student must sign a document that obligates him to accept\r\na working assignment, which should be related to his field of\r\nspecialization, for a period of three to five years.\r\n\r\nAnother facet of the system is the eradication of old values and their\r\nreplacement with new socialist values (see ch. 4). One of the first\r\ntasks of Bulgarian educators was to eliminate religious teachings and\r\npractices in the schools. Religion, as a subject, was eliminated in the\r\nearly years as was the history of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\r\nStudents are taught that atheism is both reasonable and scientific;\r\nreligion is dismissed as a relic of a superstitious and undesirable\r\npast. By the same token, students are indoctrinated strongly by\r\nteachers, directors of extracurricular activities, and colleagues to\r\nrevere and swear allegiance to the government.\r\n\r\nAnother guiding principle of the educational system in Bulgaria, which\r\nwas initiated at the time of the takeover and still obtained to some\r\ndegree in 1973, is the concept that sons and daughters of the worker and\r\npeasant classes should be favored in terms of their preference of access\r\nto education, particularly at the higher levels. This policy was clearly\r\nmotivated by a desire to compensate for the exclusion of this class from\r\nsuch institutions in the past. In the early communist years institutions\r\nof higher education charged tuition, but children of the worker-peasant\r\nclasses were exempted. By 1954 this class constituted 20 percent of the\r\nhigher education population, a figure that by 1970 had risen to 78\r\npercent. In 1973 the government was still maintaining a preferential\r\nclause for these students in higher education and reserved 10 percent of\r\nthe places in such institutions for them.\r\n\r\nAnother principle of the educational system is the promotion of\r\ntechnical or vocational education and the simultaneous downgrading of\r\nthe humanities. Academic studies were quantitatively reduced in order to\r\nplace greater emphasis on practical work. When a student has completed\r\nhis formal education in the school system, he will have at the time\r\nspent at least one-third of his school hours working on a farm, in a\r\nfactory, or at some other enterprise. In the curriculum itself technical\r\nsubjects are given a place of greater importance than the humanities.\r\nAlthough studies have indicated that a great many students seeking\r\nadmission to institutions of higher education aspire to the study of the\r\nhumanities, governmental policies have limited the number of places\r\navailable in these areas in order to train technical-vocational\r\nspecialists to meet the needs of the economy (see ch. 12).\r\n\r\nThe last important principle of Bulgarian education is the\r\nnationalization and secularization of the school system. When the\r\nCommunists took power in the 1940s, they quickly closed all foreign and\r\nprivate schools with the exception of schools for the children of Soviet\r\nofficials and diplomats. Schools of ethnic minorities fell under the\r\naegis of the government and thereby lost all autonomy. Ironically, in\r\n1973 the only private school that existed was related to the Bulgarian\r\nOrthodox Church. As the church is subservient to and dependent upon the\r\nstate, however, the existence of such a school undoubtedly represented\r\nlittle threat to the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL REFORMS\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1944 and 1948 the Communists set about eradicating the\r\nprewar educational system. By 1947, when the constitution (also called\r\nthe Dimitrov Constitution) was enacted, all prewar textbooks had been\r\nreplaced by communist texts; all schoolteachers and university\r\nprofessors who were considered reactionary or fascist had been replaced\r\nby persons loyal to the Fatherland Front (Otechestven Front) government;\r\nand all institutions of higher education had been opened to workers and\r\ntheir children, whereas students thought to have fascist or reactionary\r\ntendencies were denied admittance.\r\n\r\nThe Dimitrov Constitution stipulated further that all schools, including\r\nthose that had previously been private, would be the property of the\r\nstate; that all foreign schools would be closed for the academic year\r\n1948-49; and that religious schools would be discontinued. Ironically,\r\nthe only denominational schools that were allowed to continue were those\r\nthat trained priests, but these schools had to have special permission\r\nfrom the state in order to continue their operations.\r\n\r\nIn 1948 and 1949 another series of reforms was initiated, which,\r\nalthough less sweeping than the original reforms, tended to pattern the\r\nBulgarian school system more closely on that of the Soviet Union. In\r\nAugust 1949 a joint resolution of the BKP Central Committee and the\r\nCouncil of Ministers declared that education would be carried out in the\r\nspirit of socialism, based both on the teachings of Karl Marx and\r\nVladimir Ilyich Lenin and on Bulgarian friendship with the Soviet Union.\r\nThe ideological studies introduced into the curriculum consisted of the\r\nfundamental principles of Marx and Lenin, the history of the communist\r\nparty of the Soviet Union, and the history of the BKP. All of these\r\nsubjects became obligatory from kindergarten.\r\n\r\nThe second initiative in the 1948-49 reforms was the declaration that\r\nall universities and institutions of higher education as well as the\r\nAcademy of Sciences were no longer autonomous. A third reform during\r\nthis period was the reduction from five to four years of the gymnasium,\r\nwhich in turn reduced the total schooling from twelve to eleven years.\r\nThe fourth reform was the redesigning of polytechnic education to\r\ngreatly increase the number of trained graduates to fill the rapidly\r\nescalating demands of the economy.\r\n\r\nIn statistical terms the results of the various communist reforms were\r\nmixed. Although the number of primary and secondary schools increased\r\nslightly overall from 1938 to 1948, there was hardly any appreciable\r\ngrowth in primary schools, whereas secondary schools nearly doubled. The\r\nnumber of students, similarly, barely changed in the same ten-year\r\nperiod; the number of primary students actually declined, but the number\r\nof secondary students grew appreciably (see table 6; table 7).\r\n\r\nHigher education, on the other hand, made great strides after the\r\ncommunist takeover as the number of universities and other institutions\r\nof higher education increased by one-third. Despite the emphasis on\r\ntechnical and vocational education, such schools dropped in terms of\r\nfacilities, students, and teachers during the early communist years. The\r\nnumber of teachers of polytechnic subjects also declined during the\r\nperiod (see table 8).\r\n\r\n_Table 6.

Although all\r\nstudents had to perform certain tasks as part of their basic education,\r\nthe 1957-58 reforms dictated that graduates of higher technical and\r\nagricultural institutions had to perform one year of practical work\r\nbefore graduation. As the concept of polytechnical education became\r\nwidespread at the secondary level, practical work consumed up to\r\none-third of the total hours of education. Although experimental\r\nvocational training was introduced into the curricula of some gymnasiums\r\nin this period, other gymnasiums, particularly in the rural areas,\r\nrequired students to spend several hours weekly in formal vocational\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nIn the same 1957-58 period a number of broad, rather than structural,\r\nreforms were initiated. Schools for ethnic minorities were established\r\nin which, despite the fact that study of the Bulgarian language was\r\ncompulsory, teaching was performed in the language of the minority\r\ngroup. All schools of general education became officially coeducational,\r\nand evening classes for workers were initiated. At the same time,\r\nalthough there already had been some financial assistance, scholarships\r\nwere presented on a wide scale. In the 1957-58 academic year 46 percent\r\nof all students in institutions of higher education received stipends\r\nfrom the government. Although there were few scholarships given to\r\ngymnasium students, with the exception of Turkish students who were\r\nconsidered the least educated group, students in professional schools\r\nand technical colleges were the recipients of a large number of\r\ngovernmental stipends.\r\n\r\nThe reforms of 1959 were of more lasting significance than were the\r\n1957-58 reforms. Unlike the latter reforms, which represented a slight\r\ndeviation from the Soviet educational model, the 1959 reforms returned\r\nthe Bulgarian system once more to the original Soviet pattern. In 1958\r\nNikita Khrushchev wrote a treatise called \"Strengthening the Ties\r\nBetween School and Life\" in which he demanded a close integration of the\r\neducational system and the economy. Shortly thereafter, Zhivkov declared\r\nthat the 1957-58 school reforms in his own country were inadequate and\r\nasked for a basic reorganization of the entire school system. In July\r\n1959 a basic law, reorganizing the entire school system, was passed.\r\n\r\nThis law was entitled \"Law on Establishing a Closer Link Between\r\nEducation and Practical Life and on Furthering the Development of Public\r\nEducation in the People's Republic of Bulgaria.\" Its stated objectives\r\nwere: \"To prepare youth for life by combining education and instruction\r\nwith practical and production work\" and \"to imbue the young people with\r\na love of work and a spirit of patriotism and international solidarity.\"\r\nThe law proposed the introduction of polytechnic studies on an\r\nunprecedented scale in order to provide skilled workers for agriculture\r\nand industry. Although the main objective was to meet the demands of the\r\neconomy, it was hoped that the new emphasis on technical subjects would\r\nbreak down the exclusiveness of the educated classes, while socializing\r\nthe younger generation in communist ideological terms.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms the 1959 reforms introduced a unified twelve-year\r\nso-called secondary school--despite the fact that it included the\r\nelementary grades as well--called the medium polytechnical school, which\r\ntotally replaced the existing five-year basic school and the four-year\r\nmedium school or gymnasium. The medium polytechnical school was divided\r\ninto an eight-year elementary course and a four-year upper course. After\r\ncompleting the basic school the student was faced with four\r\nalternatives. He could enter: the upper course, which provided general\r\neducation plus specialization in an area of production; a medium\r\nprofessional school or technicum, which provided a specialized\r\neducation; a professional technical college, which prepared him for\r\nproduction in the economy; or the so-called miscellaneous training,\r\nwhich included courses organized by plants, factories, and cooperatives.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the new law provided for the improvement of teacher\r\ntraining. All teachers who taught in the fifth level or above were\r\nrequired to have a university education or its equivalent. Teachers who\r\ntaught in kindergartens or the first to fourth levels were required to\r\ntake a three-year course after the obligatory twelve-year course of\r\nschooling.\r\n\r\nThe reforms were later criticized, however, on much more far-reaching\r\ngrounds. Some felt that technical specialization was stressed to such an\r\nextreme that the liberal arts were altogether ignored. Some complained\r\nthat, although students were overburdened with superfluous details of\r\noverspecialized subjects, teachers were still basically unprepared to\r\nteach these subjects. Others felt that there was a lack of correlation\r\nbetween the work that the student had to perform and his or her area of\r\nexpertise. Still others realized that there was a basic clash between\r\nthe managers who supervised the worker-students and the students\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nDespite much criticism about the reforms, in terms of bare statistics\r\nthey were successful in greatly increasing the emphasis on\r\ntechnical-vocational training. Although the number of primary and\r\nsecondary students remained approximately at the same level and the\r\nnumber of primary and secondary schools declined drastically, there was\r\na tremendous increase in technical-vocational schools, students, and\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nIn 1967 there was another wave of educational reform in Bulgaria, as\r\nwell as in all of Eastern Europe, that once again changed the direction\r\nof education. Although most Eastern European countries began to\r\ndeemphasize polytechnic instruction, Bulgaria's course was more cautious\r\nand ambivalent. On the one hand, Bulgarian educators stated that the\r\ntime allotted for practical training would be increased, while on the\r\nother hand, efforts were made to reintroduce the humanities into the\r\ncurriculum. In the last three grades of the upper course, the curriculum\r\nwas divided into two branches: natural science and mathematics, and the\r\nhumanities. The number of general education subjects was gradually\r\nincreased, and there was renewed emphasis on foreign languages and the\r\nsocial sciences.\r\n\r\nBy 1969, however, authorities once again perceived certain problems in\r\nthe educational system and proposed counteracting reforms. One problem\r\nwas the relative cost of higher education, which was expanding, as\r\ncompared to the cost of primary education, which was both cheaper and\r\ncontracting. A second problem was the question of the availability of\r\ntrained persons for the national economy because of the long periods of\r\nschooling then required. It was argued that by the time a young man had\r\ncompleted his education and his military training, he was twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six years old. A third problem was the intense competition for\r\nplaces in higher education and other postsecondary institutions. In 1969\r\napproximately 70,000 to 75,000 students leaving secondary schools\r\ncompeted with each other for 20,000 places at the university level. A\r\nfourth problem was whether the polytechnic school should place primary\r\nemphasis on trade specialization or on academic subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the same year serious thought was given to the solution of these\r\nproblems, and tentative measures were proposed. The major thrust of\r\nthese proposals was to enable students to meet the needs of the economy\r\nby shortening the period of overall education. It was proposed that a\r\nunified polytechnic school, which would fuse general and professional\r\nelements of education, would replace the current, professionally\r\noriented polytechnic school. At the same time children would enter\r\nschool at the age of six, instead of the customary seven. The secondary\r\npolytechnic school would be a ten-year instead of a twelve-year course,\r\nallowing students to graduate at the age of sixteen. Most courses in\r\nhigher education would be reduced from five to four years, enabling\r\nstudents to complete all levels of education by the age of twenty rather\r\nthan twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe reforms would perhaps have a greater impact on the secondary system\r\nthan the other levels, as they envisioned a completely unified secondary\r\nschool system in which professional and general education would be\r\nfused. Specialization in liberal arts, mathematics and economics,\r\nchemistry and biology, social sciences, and foreign languages would be\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 these reforms were officially proposed and passed by the Council\r\nof Ministers. It was anticipated that they would be carried out over the\r\nnext ten to fifteen years. Although the concept of fusing general and\r\nprofessional education in the new unified secondary polytechnic school\r\nwas not universally popular, the reform embodying this concept was\r\npassed primarily because of the influence of one of its strongest\r\nproponents, Zhivkov.\r\n\r\nOther reforms proposed in 1972 dealt with the specific levels of the\r\neducational system and with monetary necessities to fulfill these\r\nexpectations. As it was expected that by 1975 approximately 76 percent\r\nof children from three to seven years of age would be in kindergartens,\r\nthe Sixth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) emphasized the development of a huge\r\nnetwork of kindergartens. By 1975, 85 percent of the students attending\r\nprimary school were expected to go on to the secondary level, and plans\r\nwere made to increase the construction of boarding and semiboarding\r\nschools to accommodate these students. Secondary education was to be\r\nmade compulsory in order, in Zhivkov's words, \"to give every young man\r\nand girl the opportunity not only of acquiring scientific knowledge of\r\nnature and society and the necessary general culture and polytechnical\r\neducation, but also of acquiring certain production and technical habits\r\nand skills, of preparing themselves for socially useful work.\"\r\n\r\nThe main emphasis in the 1972 reforms, however, was on higher education.\r\nIt was anticipated that there would be some 120,000 students in higher\r\neducation by 1975. Of this number it was expected that 65,000--or\r\napproximately half--would be specialists. Of the 65,000 specialists,\r\nhalf would be engaged in science and technology. Therefore, in 1972\r\nplans were being formulated for the construction of new buildings at\r\nmany of the major institutions of higher education.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill these structural changes, it was decided that both\r\nincreased expenditures and additional places for students were needed.\r\nDuring the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1966-70), about 300 million leva (for\r\nvalue of the lev--see Glossary) had been expended on education. In the\r\nSixth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) 500 million leva were to be allocated. In\r\naddition, 30,000 more places were to be provided at the preschool level,\r\n28,000 more accommodations at hostels, and 4,500 classrooms at all\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERACY\r\n\r\nFigures vary to some degree, but at the time of liberation in 1878\r\nbetween 85 and 90 percent of the Bulgarian population was illiterate. By\r\nthe early twentieth century, however, Bulgaria had achieved the highest\r\nliteracy rate in the Balkans. Although some scholars stated that only\r\nsome 31 percent of the population over school age was literate, by 1920\r\nnearly 50 percent of the population over school age was literate. By\r\n1934 only 31.6 percent of the population over school age was still\r\nilliterate, and by 1940 this figure was reduced to between 20 and 25\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nAfter the Communists took power in the country, literacy increased at a\r\nrapid pace. In 1956 only 17.6 percent of the population over twenty-five\r\nwas illiterate, and by 1965 only 8.6 percent was illiterate. In 1973,\r\nalthough total literacy for people under fifty years of age was claimed\r\nby the government, the rate of literacy of this group was probably\r\nsomewhere between 90 and 100 percent.\r\n\r\nOf the illiterate population in 1965, approximately three-fourths were\r\nwomen and only one-fourth were men, reflecting the recency of the\r\nemancipation of women in Bulgaria. Of ethnic groups, the Gypsies have\r\nboth the lowest levels of literacy and of education, whereas the Turks\r\nhave a significantly higher literacy rate. Jews, Czechs, Greeks, and\r\nRussians all have a relatively high literacy level. In 1965 there were\r\nthree times as many illiterates in rural areas as in urban. Also,\r\nilliteracy in Bulgaria was much more common among the older generation\r\nthan among the young. In 1965, of the population over 60 years of age,\r\napproximately one-third was illiterate, whereas only a very small\r\npercentage of the working-age group was illiterate. The government\r\nseemed relatively unconcerned about the problem of illiteracy among the\r\nolder people, as an official stated: \"The high illiteracy rate among the\r\nolder population does not present a problem since this is the population\r\nabove the working age and this group is not crucial to our economic\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAdministration and Finance\r\n\r\nThe 1947 constitution established both the Ministry of Education and the\r\nCommittee for Science, Art, and Culture, which held ministry status. In\r\n1954 the Law on Public Education increased the authority of the Ministry\r\nof Education; all general and vocational schools fell under its\r\njurisdiction at that time. In February 1954 the Ministry of Culture was\r\nestablished. It replaced the Committee for Science, Art, and Culture and\r\noversaw, in broad terms, the curricula at all levels of education,\r\nincluding correspondence courses.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the executive branch dealing with the legal aspects of education\r\nwas the Council of Ministers, and the Ministry of National Education\r\ndealt with all administrative matters. The minister of national\r\neducation is a member of the Presidium of the National Assembly as well\r\nas of the BKP Central Committee. Similarly, the assistant ministers of\r\neducation hold high offices in the party structure. In this way the\r\nparty not only supports educational legislation but also originates it.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of National Education has four principal tasks to perform.\r\nIts primary duty is to direct and control the educational system in\r\naccordance with the policies of the party and the government. It both\r\nformulates and approves basic documents of the educational system, such\r\nas the curricula, the school regulations, and methods. It arranges for\r\nthe publication of all school textbooks and supervises the work of the\r\npeople's councils at the local level.\r\n\r\nThe minister of national education is assisted by three vice ministers\r\nwho are appointed by the National Assembly and who head three broad\r\ndepartments: the Department of General Education, the Department of\r\nVocational Training, and the Department of Higher Education. Also within\r\nthe Ministry of National Education are the following sub-sections:\r\nMarxism-Leninism, physical culture, economic planning, finance,\r\nemployment, teaching materials, and cultural relations.\r\n\r\nAt the regional level the district people's councils have responsibility\r\nfor organization and instruction in all educational institutions with\r\nthe exception of schools of art, intermediate schools, and institutions\r\nof higher education. Each council is under the authority of its\r\nexecutive committee as well as the Ministry of National Education. The\r\nEducation Section of the council performs the routine tasks affecting\r\nthe educational system. The Ministry of National Education supervises\r\nthese education sections and assists them when necessary. They are also\r\nassisted by various advisory committees.\r\n\r\nEducation in Bulgaria is generally financed by the state budget. Schools\r\nthat are deemed to have national importance are financed by the national\r\nbudget, whereas schools that have only local significance are financed\r\nby the people's councils at the local level. Since 1964 the expenses of\r\nmany vocational training schools have been financed by various related\r\nministries, factories, and enterprises. These organizations have played\r\nan increasing role in the financing of the schools since that date.\r\n\r\nThe only available figures dealing with the financing of education are\r\nthose on higher education. As Bulgaria is considerably behind most\r\nEuropean countries in terms of the financing of education, there is very\r\nlittle public discussion of the issue. Sofia, the capital city, has one\r\nof the most severe financial problems. In 1966 only 3.2 percent of the\r\ntotal city budget was spent on matters relating to education. Generally,\r\nfinancial figures for education are categorized with those for science\r\nand culture so that it is nearly impossible to separate those figures\r\nthat deal specifically with education. In recent years educational\r\nreformers have requested greater sums for education than were allocated\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\nBulgaria's budget for education fluctuated between 133 million leva in\r\n1960 and 491 million leva in 1971. The proportion of the total budget\r\nallocated for education, however, actually decreased over the last eight\r\nyears of the period. In 1960 education represented 5.9 percent of the\r\ntotal budget; in 1964, 9 percent; in 1967, 8.4 percent; and in 1971,\r\nonly 8.3 percent. The percentage of the Bulgarian gross national product\r\n(GNP) earmarked for education in 1972 was inferior to that of some other\r\nEuropean and Asian countries. The German Democratic Republic (East\r\nGermany) spent 5.9 percent on education; the Soviet Union, 5.8 percent;\r\nJapan, 5.3 percent; Poland, 4.8 percent; Great Britain, 4.3 percent;\r\nFrance, 3.2 percent; and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany),\r\n3 percent. Bulgaria allocated only 0.5 percent of its total GNP to the\r\nfield of education.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreschool Education\r\n\r\nBefore the Communists took power in 1944 kindergartens were considered\r\nto be an unimportant factor in education. In 1921 there were only\r\ntwenty-four kindergartens in the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe Communists made a real effort to establish a far-reaching network of\r\nkindergartens, which in the late 1940s included three types: the half\r\nday, all day, and seasonal. No tuition was required for the half day\r\nkindergarten, and tuition varied--depending on the income of the\r\nfamily--for the other two types.\r\n\r\nHalf day kindergartens accepted children after six years of age,\r\npreparing them for admission to elementary schools. All day\r\nkindergartens, which were located in large towns and industrial areas,\r\ncared for children, aged three to seven, of working mothers. Seasonal\r\nkindergartens were established in rural areas for the children of\r\nmothers whose work was seasonal. These schools operated from two to ten\r\nmonths per year and also accepted children from three to seven years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 there were crèches for children from infancy to three years\r\nof age. Children from three to seven attended kindergarten. Although\r\nattendance was voluntary, it was believed that over 60 percent of the\r\npreschool-age children were enrolled in crèches or kindergartens.\r\nApproximately 50 percent of the children in elementary school have had\r\ntheir preschool education in the half day kindergartens. There were five\r\ntypes of kindergartens in Bulgaria: the half day, the all day, the\r\nseasonal, the kindergarten sanatoriums and the auxiliary kindergarten.\r\nKindergarten sanatoriums provided educational facilities for children\r\nwith tuberculosis, and auxiliary kindergartens were for the mentally\r\ndeficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nElementary Education\r\n\r\nBefore the Communists took power, there were primary schools for\r\nchildren between seven and eleven and _progymnasia_ for children eleven\r\nto fourteen years old. Although both levels of education were compulsory\r\naccording to the law, many children between the ages of seven and\r\nfourteen did not attend school. The program of the _progymnasium_ was to\r\nenable children--who might be excluded from either a gymnasium or\r\nvocational school for economic or academic reasons--to obtain additional\r\neducation beyond the primary level.\r\n\r\nAfter 1944 the Communists undertook a major revision of elementary\r\neducation in accordance with their basic principles of education (see\r\nCommunist Educational Policies, this ch.). In 1950 a new unified school\r\nsystem was established, patterned after the educational system of the\r\nSoviet Union. This unified, eleven-year system comprised both primary\r\nand postprimary education. In 1954 the Edict on Public Education stated\r\nthat the first eight years of this new general education were compulsory\r\nfor children from seven to fifteen years of age. Depending on the\r\nparticular needs of the individual community, children could attend\r\neither four-year, seven-year, or eleven-year general education schools.\r\nGenerally, the four-year schools predominated in rural areas, and the\r\nseven-year and eleven-year schools were more prevalent in larger\r\nvillages and towns.\r\n\r\nElementary education is still compulsory for both boys and girls from\r\nseven to fifteen years of age. Classes are held in the morning only and\r\nrun six days a week, Monday through Saturday. The schools are known as\r\nbasic or general schools and include not only elementary education but\r\nalso the first two phases of the eleven-year polytechnic school. The\r\nelementary course comprises grades one through four, and the\r\npostelementary courses include classes five through eight. The\r\nelementary curriculum includes the study of Bulgarian, mathematics,\r\nmusic, art, and physical education. The postelementary curriculum also\r\nencompasses the study of foreign languages and science. On both levels\r\nthe study of Russian is compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this general elementary education, according to the\r\ngovernment, is to \"provide pupils with general and polytechnic education\r\ncombined with fundamental moral, physical and aesthetic training,\r\ninstill in children a liking for work, accustom them to productive work\r\nuseful to society and prepare them for studies at a higher level.\" In\r\naccordance with these principles \"education in labor\" was made an\r\nintegral part of the curriculum. The total curriculum of elementary\r\neducation consists of a tripartite division. The academic section is\r\nsubdivided into the sciences and the humanities. The education in the\r\nlabor section consists of work, beginning in the first year of\r\nschooling, in shops, farms, and factories. The extracurricular section\r\nis dominated by the work-study program of the youth organization known\r\nas the Pioneers (see ch. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Education\r\n\r\nBefore 1944 secondary education in Bulgaria consisted of the gymnasium\r\nand the vocational school. The gymnasium was divided into three types:\r\nthe classical, the semiclassical, and the scientific. All three included\r\nthe following subjects in their curriculum: Bulgarian language and\r\nliterature; either French, German, or English; philosophy; mathematics;\r\nhistory; the history of Christianity; geography; sociology; civics;\r\nphysics; and chemistry. In the scientific and classical divisions,\r\nnatural history and drawing were also given, and Latin and Greek were\r\npresented in the classical and semiclassical gymnasiums. There was also\r\na normal school, or pedagogical part of the gymnasium, which added\r\npedagogy and physical education to the basic curriculum.\r\n\r\nSoon after the communist takeover the combined elementary-secondary\r\nperiod of schooling was reduced from twelve to eleven years. The\r\nobjectives of a secondary education were described in the following\r\nterms: \"the general promotion of the physical and intellectual\r\ndevelopment of adolescents, the weaning of their minds from extreme\r\nnationalist and reactionary ideas, the inculcation of the spirit of\r\nprogress, and preparation for creative participation in the economic and\r\ncultural life of the country.\" The curriculum of the secondary schools\r\nwas changed in order to incorporate these goals. Latin and Greek were no\r\nlonger required, but Russian became compulsory. A new subject called\r\ngeneral history subsumed within it the old studies of religion, ethics,\r\npolitical economy, and Bulgarian. Astronomy was added to the new\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\nBetween 1949 and 1959 other changes were introduced in the secondary\r\nschool system. There were then two principal forms of secondary\r\neducation: the general school and the technical school. Grades eight to\r\neleven of the general school, which were considered part of secondary\r\neducation, included study of Bulgarian language and literature; Russian;\r\nFrench, German, or English; mathematics; physics; astronomy; chemistry;\r\nbiology; history; constitutional history; geography; psychology and\r\nlogic; geometrical drawing; and physical education.\r\n\r\nTechnicums and vocational-technical secondary schools, on the other\r\nhand, offered courses ranging from two to five years that gave the\r\nstudent a specialized education. Graduates of the eleven-year general\r\nschool attended these schools for two years; students who had completed\r\nless than eleven years attended for three to five years. In 1952 labor\r\nreserve schools were established. These factory schools offered one-year\r\nor two-year training programs to young people from fourteen to seventeen\r\nyears of age who had already completed their elementary education.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s the new polytechnic secondary school was introduced in\r\norder to incorporate the elements of a general and specialized education\r\ninto one system. Although this type of secondary education continued to\r\nbe the main form of secondary education, it was criticized on two\r\nseemingly paradoxical counts. One group of critics claimed that the\r\npolytechnic school gave the student neither a sound general education\r\nnor a solid base in professional training. Another group claimed that\r\nthe polytechnic school was both too narrow and too technical, depriving\r\nthe student of a broad background in general areas.\r\n\r\nIn mid 1973 there were three major types of secondary education in\r\nBulgaria: the secondary polytechnic or a semitechnical variation of the\r\ngymnasium, the vocational-technical schools, and the technicums (see\r\nfig. 5). Roughly 95 percent of students who had completed elementary\r\nschool continued in secondary education.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5. The Bulgarian School System, 1973_]\r\n\r\nApproximately one-third of students continuing in secondary education\r\nattend the polytechnic school. The stated purpose of this kind of school\r\nis \"to provide pupils with wider scientific education and more intensive\r\npolytechnical training, through practical production experience closely\r\nlinked with general education and technical subjects, and to prepare\r\nthem for active working and intellectual life or for their continued\r\nstudies at higher levels. This secondary course completes the pupils'\r\nbasic science studies and polytechnical preparation. The practical\r\nexperiences gained prepares them for specialization in a major branch of\r\nproduction work.\"\r\n\r\nPolytechnic schools can be either part of the general schools--in which\r\ncase they consist of grades nine through eleven--or separate schools in\r\nthemselves. In the latter case the course is of either four or five\r\nyears' duration. These schools are also open to factory and\r\noffice-workers who are able to remain in their positions, on a reduced\r\nbasis, while continuing their education.\r\n\r\nTechnicums are more popular than the polytechnic schools. Although\r\nsources differ with respect to the exact percentage of elementary\r\nstudents who continue their education in technicums--with some claiming\r\napproximately 40 percent and others as high as 77 percent--probably\r\nabout 50 percent continue their schooling in this area. According to the\r\ngovernment the purpose of the technicums is to \"train specialists at\r\nintermediate levels for the various sectors of the national economy:\r\nindustry, agriculture, and building construction, transport services,\r\ncommerce and public health services.\" At the same time, however, the\r\ntechnicums provide general education that corresponds to some extent\r\nwith the program of the polytechnic school.\r\n\r\nThese schools, more than the polytechnic schools, are directly related\r\nto trends in the economy. Technicums are designed to produce supervisors\r\nand skilled workers who will satisfy the needs of the economy. The\r\ncourse of study varies from three to four years. Although some general\r\nsubjects are taught, emphasis is on the acquisition of specialized\r\nknowledge in such fields as agriculture and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe least popular form of secondary education in Bulgaria is the\r\nvocational-technical school, which is a form of trade school. Although\r\nthe number of students in vocational-technical schools has doubled since\r\n1944, only approximately 20 percent of the graduates of elementary\r\neducation continue in this area. The government states that \"Vocational\r\ntraining schools are designed to train skilled workers for industry and\r\nagriculture.\" The schools can either operate independently or be a part\r\nof a technicum or agricultural or industrial enterprise. Although the\r\ncourses are generally open to elementary graduates, workers under thirty\r\nwho have not completed their primary education may also continue their\r\ntraining in these schools.\r\n\r\nThe program of the vocational-technical school varies from one to three\r\nyears. In the case of workers under thirty, the program runs from one\r\nto four years. Graduates of the program receive the title of skilled\r\nworkmen; they are obligated to work in their field of specialization for\r\nthree years. The curriculum in the vocational-technical school includes:\r\nBulgarian, Russian, physics, mathematics, and physical education. These\r\nsubjects consume only half of the allotted time; the other half is spent\r\nworking in factories or on farms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these three basic forms of secondary education, there are\r\nspecial types of secondary schools as well. Specialized secondary\r\nschools exist for music, art, and ballet. Although most operate only on\r\nthe secondary level--requiring the completion of the elementary\r\nschool--some give the complete eleven-year program. The length of study\r\ngenerally is four years. Music schools offer courses in instrumental\r\nmusic, singing, musical theory, and general education. Students of dance\r\nstudy at the National School of Choreography, which is divided into a\r\nsection offering classical ballet and another offering Bulgarian folk\r\ndance. Art students study at a special gymnasium.\r\n\r\nAnother form of secondary education is the foreign language secondary\r\nschool. In these schools all instruction is given in the foreign\r\nlanguage selected. Russian is the most popular language, followed by\r\nFrench, German, and English. Although no figures are available for\r\nschools of other languages, in 1973 there were six English-language\r\nschools with fifteen native English instructors. Of the total number of\r\nplaces available in these language schools, 50 percent are reserved for\r\ngirls and 50 percent for boys. Of the same total, 20 percent are\r\nreserved for children of \"the active fighters against fascism and\r\ncapitalism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHigher Education\r\n\r\nIn the period between the 1921 reforms and the years just before World\r\nWar II, there were nine institutions of higher education in Bulgaria.\r\nThe University of Sofia was both the largest and the oldest. The most\r\npopular faculties in higher educational institutions at that time in\r\norder of popularity were: education, law, economics, medicine, and\r\nagriculture. The arts were the least popular faculty. In mid 1973\r\nstatistics were unavailable for both engineering and physical education\r\n(see table 9).\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists took power in 1944 they made sweeping changes in the\r\nfield of higher education. Universities--which had heretofore been\r\nautonomous--were put under state control; members of the party sat on\r\nfaculty councils that selected and promoted professors. University\r\ngraduates were placed by the government and were subject to punishment\r\nunder the newly established penal code if they refused to accept\r\nassignments.\r\n\r\n_Table 9.

Courses generally ranged from five to six years. Certain\r\nworkers were allowed to attend shorter courses given by the various\r\ninstitutions while they continued to work. Although they were required\r\nto pass examinations, they did not have to attend classes regularly.\r\n\r\nBetween 1948 and 1952 the curriculum became more and more patterned\r\nafter the curriculum of the Soviet Union. In 1948 Marxist-Leninist\r\nstudies were introduced; in 1949 political economy and the history of\r\nthe Communist Party of the Soviet Union became obligatory for all\r\nuniversity students. By 1950 the party newspaper, _Rabotnichesko Delo_,\r\nreported that 150 Soviet texts were being utilized in institutions of\r\nhigher education. By 1952 students were obliged to study both\r\ndialectical and historical materialism, the rudiments of\r\nMarxism-Leninism, and the history of the BKP. Study of these subjects\r\nwas generally mandatory for three years.\r\n\r\nIn mid 1973 there were two major forms of higher educational\r\ninstitutions: teacher training institutions and university level\r\ninstitutions. In the latter category are universities, technical\r\ninstitutes, agricultural institutes, medical schools, art academies, and\r\nhigher schools of economics. In 1972 there were twenty-two university\r\nlevel institutions, sixteen of which were in Sofia. The remainder were\r\nlocated in the provincial cities of Plovdiv, Varna, Svishtov, and Ruse.\r\nThe courses of study range from four to six years; five years is the\r\naverage period. In 1970 in proportion to the total population of the\r\ncountry, Bulgaria was fourth in the world in terms of the number of\r\nstudents--which constituted about 1 percent of the total\r\npopulation--attending institutions of higher education, following the\r\nUnited States, the Soviet Union, and Japan.\r\n\r\nHigher education in Bulgaria is conceived primarily in terms of the\r\nnational economy. The entire educational process at the higher level is\r\ndetermined by the needs and prerequisites of the economy. The government\r\nhas stated: \"The main tasks of the institutions of higher education are:\r\nto train qualified specialists, imbued with Communist ideals, for all\r\nfields of activity, who will be conversant with the latest developments\r\nin science and technology, to train teachers and research specialists\r\nfor the institutions of higher education and scientific organizations,\r\nto take systematic measures to improve the qualifications of specialists\r\nin various branches of the national economy; [and] to propagate\r\nscientific, technical and political knowledge among the workers.\"\r\n\r\nStudents at the undergraduate level--with the exception of students of\r\nworker and peasant origin--are expected to pass a written examination in\r\norder to gain admission. Fifty percent of the total number of admissions\r\nare reserved for people who have been employed for a two-year period.\r\nMost graduates are obliged to work for three years after graduation in a\r\nposition assigned to them by the government. Unlike the prewar\r\nfaculties, technical and scientific faculties have had the highest\r\nenrollments. Although education continues to draw large enrollments, in\r\n1971 engineering had the largest number of students, followed by\r\neducation, economics, agriculture, and medicine. Law and physical\r\neducation had the lowest number of students at that time. As the State\r\nCommittee for Science, Technical Progress, and Higher Education\r\ndetermines the specialization to be pursued, this list reflects more the\r\npreferences of the government than those of the students.\r\n\r\nBecause the government determines the fields of specialization to be\r\npursued by students of higher education, over a ten-year period--from\r\n1960 to 1970--the pendulum has swung away from the arts and toward the\r\npure sciences. The fields most preferred by the students themselves,\r\nhowever, and those that earn the highest wages, are still medicine,\r\narchitecture, journalism, and foreign languages.\r\n\r\nThe State Committee for Education and Technical Progress stipulates the\r\nnumber of admissions as well as the courses to be followed in graduate\r\nwork. All applicants for graduate study must have a minimum of one year\r\nof working experience in their fields of specialization. In addition to\r\ncompletion of four or five years of higher education, the applicant must\r\npass examinations in his field of specialization, in Russian, and in one\r\nWestern European language. The curriculum is determined by the various\r\nresearch institutes of the Academy of Sciences, the Academy of\r\nAgricultural Sciences, or other institutions of higher education. The\r\nterm of graduate study is approximately four to 4-½ years.\r\n\r\nBeyond the usual graduate study is the doctoral program. To obtain the\r\ndoctor of science degree, the student must prepare a dissertation that\r\naccording to governmental criteria, contains \"a significant scientific\r\ncontribution, new educational methods and proposals, theoretical\r\nconclusions and discoveries of great significance for the advancement of\r\nscience, technology, and the national economy.\" A candidate for this\r\ndegree must either hold a candidate degree, be thoroughly accredited in\r\nhis profession, or have proof of significant contributions to the\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the exchange of foreign students, there are only a\r\nrelatively small number of foreign students in Bulgaria, and only a tiny\r\npercentage of the Bulgarian student population studies abroad. Although\r\ntheoretically opportunities exist for Bulgarian students to study in\r\nother countries, in fact, opportunities are very limited. There are\r\nstrict regulations regarding foreign study. In 1971 the Ministry of\r\nNational Education stated that only students of parents permanently\r\nemployed abroad could study there; no students with independent sources\r\nof income were allowed to study in foreign universities. In 1971 between\r\n1.5 and 1.8 percent of the Bulgarian student population were foreign\r\nstudents. In the academic year 1970/71 only 1,603 students studied\r\nabroad. Of these, 1047 studied in the Soviet Union; 226 studied in East\r\nGermany; 154 studied in Czechoslovakia; and twelve students pursued\r\ntheir studies in other countries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time foreign students are not numerous in Bulgaria, although\r\nthey come from a variety of countries. As of 1972 only 1,240 foreign\r\nstudents had been graduated from Bulgarian universities. Among these\r\ngraduates were 174 from Albania, 129 from Syria, 126 from East Germany,\r\nninety-four from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North\r\nKorea), fifty-seven from Kenya, and fifty from the Democratic Republic\r\nof Vietnam (North Vietnam). In the academic year 1969/70 alone, 1,882\r\nforeign students attended Bulgarian institutions of higher education.\r\nThese students came from ninety-two countries; they include 430 students\r\nfrom North Vietnam, 393 from Syria, 106 from the Sudan, forty-five from\r\nIraq, and twenty-two from Cuba. Although the focus in foreign student\r\nexchange is definitely on the developing countries--for both economic\r\nand political reasons--in 1971 foreign student exchanges with Western\r\ncountries were being increased.\r\n\r\nAlthough higher education is tuition free in Bulgaria, financial\r\nassistance is still required by a large number of students. The\r\npercentage of students on governmental scholarships varies from year to\r\nyear, generally ranging between 30 to 40 percent. In 1965 over 39\r\npercent of the student population received scholarships, whereas in 1970\r\nonly 30 percent received them. There are two basic conditions for\r\nscholarships as stipulated by the state: acceptable grade averages and a\r\nfamily income--per family member--that does not exceed 70 leva per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThere are still severe difficulties in the field of higher education in\r\nBulgaria. One problem is the acute shortage of professors in the areas\r\nof engineering and technology in institutions of higher education. At\r\nsome times the shortage is so extreme that advertisements are placed in\r\nthe newspapers in order to recruit personnel.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty in higher education is overcrowding in the schools\r\nand in the cities where the institutions are located. This dilemma is\r\nparticularly acute in Sofia, where most of the major universities and\r\ninstitutes are located. In school year 1969/70 there were 82,573\r\nstudents enrolled in higher educational institutions; of this number,\r\n59,130--roughly three-fourths--were in Sofia. As many of the students\r\ncome to Sofia from other areas of the country, the influx of students\r\nhas created a severe housing shortage. One solution, which has been\r\nexplored to some extent in recent years, has been for students to enroll\r\nin institutions in major cities to study in their regional areas during\r\nthe year and come to Sofia only when examinations are given.\r\nApproximately one-third of the total student population have studied on\r\nthis basis.\r\n\r\nA more serious problem is the issue of student preferences versus the\r\ndemands of the economy. Since the government requires trained scientific\r\nand technological personnel, there are more admissions in these areas\r\nthan in the arts. Students, however, have indicated a greater interest\r\nin the humanities, but admissions in these areas are few. In 1973 for\r\nevery place available in the humanities, there were six applicants. For\r\nevery place available in the sciences, there were only four applicants.\r\nThe inevitable result of such a policy is the creation of a group of\r\nyoung people who are engaged either in a study not of their choice or\r\nwho have been dissuaded from the field of higher education altogether.\r\n\r\nThe most serious problem is the fact that only a small proportion of\r\napplicants are accepted in universities and institutes because there are\r\nsimply not enough facilities available to them. In an average year there\r\nare generally 70,000 applicants and only 15,000 acceptances. Thus,\r\nroughly 80 percent of all applicants are rejected by the institutions of\r\nhigher education in Bulgaria. Although students are allowed to reapply\r\nat a future date, because they are not generally permitted to study\r\nabroad, this overflow has resulted in the problem of the so-called idle\r\nyouth. At the beginning of 1972 authorities estimated that there were\r\napproximately 50,000 of these people. Although the government has\r\nattempted to deal with this problem by forcing the idlers to either work\r\nor be trained for work--and they have been quite successful, as idlers\r\nwere estimated to be down from approximately 51,000 to 9,000 in less\r\nthan six months--they have failed to deal with the root cause of the\r\nproblem, that is, insufficient places in higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEACHER TRAINING\r\n\r\nBetween 1921 and 1932 all primary and _progymnasium_ teachers had to\r\ncomplete the normal school section of the gymnasium. In 1932, however,\r\nall normal schools were abolished, and teachers were trained in two-year\r\npedagogical institutes that demanded completion of the gymnasium for\r\nadmission. The pedagogical institutes were subdivided into three\r\nsections: the humanities, the sciences, and arts and crafts. Gymnasium\r\nteachers, in turn, had to have a university degree. Vocational-school\r\nteachers generally were vocational-school graduates themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1944 two new forms of teacher training, both based on the Soviet\r\nmodel, were established. Teachers in the kindergartens and the four-year\r\nelementary schools, who had already completed seven years of elementary\r\nschool, attended five-year teacher training schools. Teachers of grades\r\nfive through seven, who had completed their secondary education, trained\r\nat two-year institutes. As before the communist takeover, teachers of\r\nsecondary education and university professors had to complete their\r\ntraining at a university. Teachers of physical education, fine arts, and\r\nmusic were trained at the appropriate section of an institution of\r\nhigher education.\r\n\r\nIn 1953 the government established the Institute for the Improvement of\r\nTeachers for the purpose of providing refresher courses for teachers.\r\nThis institute also provided teachers with the proper ideological\r\norientation. The government stated that the objectives of this institute\r\nwere to provide the \"dogmatic ideological improvement of teachers ...\r\nand ... the study and application of [the] Soviet teaching experience.\"\r\nThe institute offered such courses as pedagogy, psychology, Bulgarian\r\nlanguage and literature, Russian language and literature, Bulgarian\r\nhistory, the Bulgarian constitution, mathematics and physics, natural\r\nscience and chemistry, and geography.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, however, it was decided that all elementary-school\r\nteachers--those who taught grades one through four--would be trained at\r\nteacher training colleges, and all secondary-school teachers--who taught\r\ngrades five through eleven--would attend higher educational\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn mid 1973 both kindergarten teachers and teachers of the first to\r\nfifth grades were trained at intermediate teacher training institutes.\r\nTeachers of grades five through eight also began their training at the\r\nsame institutes, where they trained for three years after the completion\r\nof their secondary education. When they had completed this level of\r\ntheir education, they continued at an institute of higher education.\r\nTeachers of the fifth through eleventh grades had to have a diploma from\r\nan institution of higher education. Vocational-school teachers and art\r\nteachers were trained at appropriate faculties of higher educational\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nTeachers are paid at various levels depending on their academic\r\nbackgrounds and current circumstances. The three basic determinants of a\r\nteacher's salary are his or her academic qualifications, the number of\r\nclasses covered per week, and the overall length of service. Every\r\nteacher is entitled to a 4-percent increase in salary after every five\r\nyears of teaching. The total increase is limited to 16 percent. Teachers\r\nwho work excessively long hours are granted overtime pay. In the case of\r\nteachers who are forced to teach in areas where living conditions are\r\nconsidered difficult, extra salaries are given. Teachers who are engaged\r\nin pilot programs receive a 5-percent supplement to their salaries in\r\norder to repay them for the necessary research and training. Teachers\r\nwho teach in special schools, special kindergartens, and schools for\r\nmaladjusted children also receive supplemental salaries. Teachers\r\nwho--in addition to their regular duties--work in pupils' centers,\r\nboarding schools, and evening study periods receive an additional 20\r\npercent of their original salary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER EDUCATION\r\n\r\nBefore World War II there were very few facilities for education that\r\ndid not fall into the standard educational system. Schools for the\r\nhandicapped, for example, were almost nonexistent. Just before the war\r\nthere were only five schools of this kind and only 400 children were\r\nenrolled. There were three schools for the deaf, one for the blind, and\r\none for the mentally retarded.\r\n\r\nBy 1944 the number of schools for the handicapped had declined to four,\r\nand only 200 children were enrolled. One of the first pieces of\r\neducational legislation under the Communists provided specifically for\r\nthis type of school. Although the development of these schools in the\r\nearly years was quite slow, eventually, by the early 1960s, there were\r\nseventy special schools, caring for approximately 8,000 children. These\r\nspecial schools provided general schooling for the handicapped--although\r\nthe curriculum was, of necessity, modified to suit the needs of the\r\nindividual student. Emphasis was on vocational training.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus was on adult education. The major objective was to\r\nraise the level of literacy in the country. Between 1944 and 1950 there\r\nwere special courses that were aimed at both total illiterates and\r\nsemiliterates. When, by the early 1950s, this goal had been\r\naccomplished, these courses were reduced in number and replaced by other\r\nkinds of adult education. Part-time courses at the secondary level were\r\nmade available for workers. Evening classes--which taught new vocational\r\nskills and improved already existing skills--became common. Higher\r\neducation through correspondence courses opened new avenues to people\r\nwho had previously had only a vocational education.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 the first boarding schools were established. In 1971 new plans\r\nwere formulated to increase the number of such schools. It was\r\nanticipated that 30 percent of all first to eighth graders would attend\r\nsuch schools by 1975, that 50 to 60 percent would attend by 1980, and\r\nthat a full 80 percent would live in boarding schools by 1990.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide diversity of schools that do not fall into the standard\r\neducational system. In terms of special education there are elementary\r\nschools for the blind, deaf, mentally retarded, and children who are\r\notherwise handicapped. All children in these categories begin their\r\nschooling at the age of seven with the exception of the retarded, who\r\nbegin at eight. These children attend school for eight years and may\r\nthen continue in schools of general education, technicums, or other\r\nschools. Retarded children, after completion of the eight years, go on\r\nto special enterprises that are supervised by the Ministry of Public\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\nChildren who are either recuperating from, or are prone to, illness\r\nattend primary and secondary schools located in areas where the climate\r\nis propitious for their recovery. Children in these schools are accepted\r\nat any point between the first and eleventh grades. Although the\r\ncurriculum is somewhat modified, the basic content of the courses is\r\nessentially the same as in the regular primary and secondary schools.\r\nMost pupils attend these schools only temporarily, generally from four\r\nor five months to a year.\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists came to power they stipulated that private schools\r\ncould continue only if they had express permission from the government\r\nand were operated under governmental authority. In the early years of\r\ncommunist rule, diplomatic missions continued to operate schools for\r\nthe children of foreign emissaries. In 1973, however, the only private\r\nschools were the secondary school, known in Bulgaria as a seminary, and\r\nthe Ecclesiastical Academy of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these special schools, there are technical and vocational\r\nschools of various kinds that are not part of the regular school system.\r\nBetween secondary and higher technical schools fall the advanced\r\ntechnicums, which function on a postsecondary level. Courses generally\r\nrun from two to three years, depending on the field of specialization.\r\nThere are advanced technicums for such specializations as mining,\r\nmedicine, veterinary medicine, and industrial chemistry. All schools\r\ninclude courses in Marxism-Leninism, higher mathematics, and physical\r\neducation in addition to the courses of specialization. Also on the\r\ntechnical-vocational level are six-month training courses that are\r\norganized by factories, cooperatives, and other enterprises. These\r\ncourses are designed to improve the workers' skills or to retrain\r\nworkers for other areas of specialization. These courses include both\r\ntheoretical studies and practical work.\r\n\r\nEvening courses, correspondence courses, refresher courses, and special\r\nresearch programs are also numerous in the country. Workers up to thirty\r\nyears of age who have not completed their elementary education are urged\r\nto attend evening schools--known in Bulgaria as shift courses--or\r\ncorrespondence courses. In both types of school the average length of\r\nstudy is from one to three years, depending on the amount of elementary\r\neducation completed. Once these courses are completed, the worker may\r\ncontinue in either a secondary polytechnic or a vocational school.\r\nEventually, he may go on to an institution of higher education.\r\nRefresher courses, on the other hand, are at the higher education level\r\nand are provided for industrial specialists in order to keep them\r\nabreast of the latest developments in science and technology. Teachers\r\nand researchers are encouraged to hold research fellowships that\r\nfunction under the various institutions of higher education as well as\r\nthe Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe final component of specialized education is conducted by the party.\r\nBased on Marxism-Leninism, it is geared to indoctrinate party members\r\nbut is provided for nonparty members as well. The objectives of this\r\nform of education were summed up by Georgi Dimitrov, premier of the\r\ncountry from 1946 until 1949, who stated that these schools are to\r\nprepare \"individuals in the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism\r\n... in order that they become independent practical organizers and\r\nleaders, capable of leading the masses in the struggle against the class\r\nenemy.\" The instructors of party education are trained at the Institute\r\nfor Political Instruction of the Central Committee of the BKP, which in\r\nturn supervises the work of the Central Leninist Party School. In\r\naddition to the general dissemination of party policy by these\r\ninstructors, there are both formal study circles and political schools\r\nthat present two-year courses in the history of both the Bulgarian and\r\nthe Soviet communist parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a proud cultural heritage that dates to early medieval\r\ntimes. During the Golden Age (A.D. 893-927) of the first and second\r\nBulgarian kingdom, Bulgarian arts and letters dominated the Slavic\r\nworld. Exposed to the flourishing culture of neighboring Byzantium,\r\nBulgarians absorbed its influence, adapted it to their own Slavic\r\nculture and language, and then spread it among the less advanced Slavic\r\npeoples in the Balkans and to the north.\r\n\r\nAfter the Turkish conquest in 1396, cultural development was retarded\r\nfor several centuries until the drive for liberation in the nineteenth\r\ncentury rekindled its creative spark. In contrast to the Golden Age,\r\nhowever, when Bulgarian culture was widespread, modern artistic and\r\nintellectual expression tended to be provincial in both its audience and\r\nits content. After independence, although interest in cultural and\r\nintellectual matters was high, support for it was restricted to a\r\nminority in Sofia and in a few of the largest towns. The government made\r\nsome contribution to the country's artistic development through small\r\nsubsidies to institutions and government jobs for artists and\r\nintellectuals, but the subsidies were not always on the basis of merit.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II few people could made an adequate living through\r\ncreative work alone, with the possible exception of members of the\r\nNational Theater and Opera. The prestige of university professors,\r\nmembers of the Academy of Sciences, and the leading singers, artists,\r\nactors, and writers was high, but the financial rewards were hardly\r\ncommensurate with their standing. Despite their prestige, Bulgarian\r\nwriters and intellectuals have not enjoyed the same position of\r\nleadership and influence that has been traditional in other countries of\r\nEastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe communist government had promoted pride in the cultural heritage by\r\nrestoring and preserving the country's medieval treasures and national\r\nrevival masterpieces and by promoting traditional folk arts both in\r\ntheir own right and as inspiration to other forms of artistic\r\nexpression. Considerable funds and efforts have been devoted to the\r\npromotion of new artistic and intellectual expression, which is seen as\r\nan important medium for the political and social education of the\r\npeople. For this reason the leadership has tried to keep artistic and\r\nintellectual expression under control and to use it for its own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nDespite controls, artistic and intellectual life is active. Not all\r\ncreative effort becomes public, and that which does not meet the\r\nprescribed criteria of style and content is known only by its creator\r\nand a few select friends; nevertheless, it is produced. Much of what\r\npasses the censor is of doubtful artistic quality, but works of\r\nconsiderable merit have appeared in all forms of artistic expression.\r\nGifted artists and writers find ways to express their talent within the\r\nconfines of government regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTS AND SCIENCES UNDER COMMUNISM\r\n\r\nSince 1944 artistic and intellectual expression have been subject to the\r\ncultural policy of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary),\r\nwhich has followed a relatively strict adherence to the concept of\r\nSocialist Realism as developed in the Soviet Union. Under this concept\r\nart, music, and literature are required to promote communist ideology\r\nand present an idealized picture of communist society. In order to\r\nimpart the ideological message, artistic and intellectual expression\r\nmust be understood by the common man and, therefore, can only take the\r\nform of straightforward representative statements.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of de-Stalinization in the mid-1950s, cultural\r\ncontrols became less restrictive, and artistic and intellectual\r\nexpression burst into new creativity and life. Although this outburst\r\nnever reached the proportions it did in Poland and Hungary during the\r\nsame period, the regime considered it a threat and reimposed strict\r\ncontrols in the late 1950s. At that time the government was preparing\r\nfor a great push in economic development and, to further this goal,\r\nmobilized the cultural community into service as propagandists.\r\n\r\nAnother thaw in cultural restriction occurred in the early 1960s when\r\nseveral factions were struggling for control of the BKP. After Todor\r\nZhivkov assumed firm control of the party, writers and artists were\r\nagain required to serve the needs of the state until the fall of Nikita\r\nKhrushchev in the Soviet Union, and an attempted coup in Bulgaria forced\r\nZhivkov to broaden his popular support by relaxing the BKP's control of\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\nThis ebb and flow of restriction on artistic and intellectual expression\r\ncontinues and serves as a barometer for the political and economic\r\nclimate in the country. At no time since the mid-1950s did cultural\r\npolicy reach the degree of repression of the Stalinist period. The\r\nleadership in Bulgaria, as did those in other Eastern European\r\ncountries, learned that repression was counterproductive. Instead, it\r\nadopted a subtler method of control through the publishers, art\r\ngalleries, theater companies, and other outlets for creative expression,\r\nall of which are run by the state in conformity with the guidelines on\r\ncultural policy. Because a creative artist must communicate his ideas to\r\nan audience in order to achieve fulfillment, he tends to adapt his ideas\r\nand principles to what is acceptable to the available outlets for his\r\nwork. Thus, self-censorship has replaced direct government control for\r\nthe most part.\r\n\r\nFrom a material standpoint, the life of a creative artist in\r\ncontemporary Bulgaria is far more secure than that of his counterpart in\r\na capitalist country. Creative expression is seen as a social function;\r\ntherefore, society owes the creative artist an assured livelihood. This\r\nis provided either through regular salaries from publishing houses,\r\nacademies of music or art, or other agencies that employ artists or\r\nthrough stipends paid to creative artists who do not have a regular\r\nsalary to depend on. Free or low-cost room and board are also available\r\nto creative artists and their families at special artists' colonies or\r\nretreats operated by professional unions in the creative arts and by\r\ngovernment agencies for the promotion of the arts and sciences. Under\r\nthis system, however, the artist is under constant pressure to produce\r\nin order to justify his salary or stipend.\r\n\r\nIn order to qualify for any of the material advantages, in fact, in\r\norder to function as a professional artist or scholar, an individual\r\nmust be a member of the appropriate professional union. The unions are,\r\nfor the most part, an arm of the BKP and another instrument for\r\nenforcing cultural policy (see ch. 9). Only the Writers' Union has\r\ndemonstrated a certain degree of independence based on the recognized\r\npower of the written word. As recently as December 1972 the union again\r\nresisted integration into the Committee on Art and Culture, a\r\nsupradepartmental government agency having a wide range of authority in\r\nthe cultural sphere. The Writers' Union is the only professional union\r\nin the arts that has not been integrated into the committee.\r\n\r\nThe principal aim of cultural policy since 1944 has been to popularize\r\nthe arts and sciences by making them accessible to all segments of the\r\npopulation and to utilize those mediums for the promotion of communist\r\nvalues. Popularization of the arts has been accomplished by greatly\r\nexpanding the facilities that present the arts to the public and by\r\nsupporting these facilities with state funds. Many new orchestras,\r\ntheater companies, publishers, and art galleries have come into\r\nexistence since World War II. Touring exhibits and road companies take\r\nthe arts into small towns and villages. Radio and television have been\r\nextensively utilized to promote the arts and learning. Through state\r\nsupport, the prices of books and admission tickets have been kept\r\nextremely low in order to bring them within the reach of as many persons\r\nas possible. The traditional library clubs have been reinforced by a\r\nnetwork of \"houses of culture,\" which serve as cultural centers in\r\nvillages and in urban neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe origins of Bulgarian literature date back to A.D. 855 when the Greek\r\npriests Cyril and Methodius designed an alphabet--Cyrillic--suitable for\r\nthe Slavic languages in order to facilitate the Christianization of the\r\nSlavs (see ch. 2). At first the alphabet was used to translate the Bible\r\nand other Christian religious texts, but in the Golden Age of the First\r\nBulgarian Kingdom several original religious and secular tests were\r\nwritten by Bulgarians in their own language. In the late Middle Ages a\r\nsubstantial literature in Bulgarian was created. Although the authors\r\nwere all churchmen, much of the literature was secular. A whole body of\r\napocryphal literature--so-called heretical tales and legends--came into\r\nbeing at that time.\r\n\r\nDuring five centuries of Turkish rule, no literature was produced except\r\nthe orally transmitted folksongs and ballads. Not until the second half\r\nof the eighteenth century, when Turkish rule began to degenerate, did\r\nBulgarian literature revive itself as part of the awakening national\r\nconsciousness of the people. The first book to appear was Father Paisi's\r\n_Slav-Bulgarian History_, a highly nationalistic book published in 1762\r\nthat played a major role in the struggle for liberation. During the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century, several Bulgarian texts were\r\npublished in neighboring countries. These were extremely influential in\r\ndeveloping the modern Bulgarian language as their publication coincided\r\nwith the establishment of schools and the spread of education among the\r\nBulgarian people. A number of periodicals were also started by\r\nBulgarians abroad, but most of them were irregular and short lived. Of\r\nconsiderable significance, however, was the collection and publication,\r\nfirst in periodicals and later in book form, of the folksongs and\r\nballads that had kept alive the language and culture of the Bulgarians\r\nduring the five centuries of Turkish rule. Much of the interest in folk\r\nliterature came from outside the country from other Slavs in Serbia,\r\nCroatia, Czechoslovakia, and Russia, who were going through their own\r\nnational awakening and had a kindred feeling for the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nThe early modern literature was nationalistic and didactic. Its authors\r\nwere educators involved in the spread of education and in the\r\nmodernization of the language and revolutionaries fighting for an\r\nindependent Bulgaria. Modernization and social reform were other strong\r\ncurrents permeating the literature of that time and later. Such poets as\r\nPetko Slaveikov, Lyuben Karavelov, and Khristo Botev were strongly\r\ninfluenced by the Russian social reformers and revolutionaries of the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. Botev was the most outstanding\r\npoet of this era. His short, intense, and fiery poems continue to arouse\r\npatriotic feelings of Bulgarians everywhere. Botev's revolutionary\r\nfervor and heroism have been identified by the present-day regime with\r\nits own revolutionary movement, and he has been accorded great honor.\r\n\r\nIn the postindependence period the dominant literary figure was Ivan\r\nVazov, whose influence on subsequent generations of writers has been\r\ntremendous. Known as the national poet and father of modern Bulgarian\r\nliterature, Vazov was primarily a writer and not a crusader or\r\nrevolutionary as were his predecessors. He was steeped in the great\r\nliterature of Europe and Russia and used the Bulgarian setting and\r\ntraditions to write about universal ideas. Vazov's greatest novel,\r\n_Under the Yoke_, describing Bulgarian life under the Turks, has been\r\nwidely translated.\r\n\r\nVazov and his contemporaries Yordan Yovkov and Pencho Slaveikov (son of\r\nPetko Slaveikov) sought to direct Bulgarian literature away from its\r\nconfines of national politics and reform into a more general artistic\r\nand philosophical outlook. They were joined in this effort by the\r\nsomewhat younger Elin Pelin, whose stories have also been widely\r\ntranslated. Although these writers continued to draw much of their\r\ninspiration from native scenery, folk themes, and village life, they\r\nwere writers of universal quality and appeal.\r\n\r\nLater, rival literary groups, each with its journal, laid the basis for\r\nmarked development in poetry, the short story, and the novel between the\r\ntwo world wars. No outstanding literary figure emerged, but writers\r\ncontinued to experiment with a variety of themes and forms.\r\n\r\nRealism had always been a strong theme in Bulgarian literature, and in\r\nthe decade after 1944 the Communists sought to utilize this tradition in\r\nimposing Soviet-style Socialist Realism as the desired form of\r\nexpression. Writers who conformed to the prescribed style were\r\ngenerously rewarded with stipends and special privileges that encouraged\r\na volume of writing heretofore unknown. The novel became the main\r\nliterary form as it lends itself particularly well to the prerequisites\r\nof the prescribed literary style. Nikola Vaptsarov and Khristo\r\nSmyrnenski have been singled out by the government as outstanding\r\nwriters in the style of Socialist Realism.\r\n\r\nMost of the literature produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s has\r\nbeen classed at best as mediocre, even by Bulgarians themselves. Several\r\nworks of that period, however, have been recognized as outstanding. The\r\nmost acclaimed of these has been Dimitur Dimov's _Tobacco_, dealing with\r\nthe revolutionary movement among tobacco workers before and during World\r\nWar II. The novel was strongly condemned when first published in 1951\r\nbut, after the relaxation of cultural controls in the mid-1950s, it was\r\nhailed as the best novel since Vazov's _Under the Yoke_.\r\n\r\nDissatisfaction of the writers with the restrictions imposed on them and\r\ndiscontent of the public with the monotony and lack of literary quality\r\nof contemporary writing became evident in the mid-1950s. These feelings\r\nbroke into the open when a mild form of de-Stalinization was put into\r\neffect in 1956 (see ch. 9). Although the so-called writers' revolt never\r\nreached the proportions of those in Poland or Hungary, it did bring\r\nabout a short period of relative freedom in literary expression and a\r\nnumber of outstanding literary works that aroused a great controversy.\r\nForemost among these was Emil Manov's _An Unauthentic Case_, which\r\ndescribes interparty conflict. Todor Genov's play _Fear_ also received\r\nhigh praise for its treatment of the corruption by power of a once\r\nidealistic Communist.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the writers' revolt, with one exception, were all loyal\r\nCommunists who had become disillusioned with what they saw as the\r\nhypocrisy and dishonesty of the leadership, which they felt was leading\r\nthe people into moral bankruptcy. Their main forum was a new periodical,\r\n_Plamuk_, edited by Manov, foremost of the rebels. The main demand of\r\nthe rebels was that an artist should be free to choose his themes and\r\nmethods of presentation provided he remain loyal to communist ideology.\r\n\r\nWhen the exposure in literature of the spiritual decline of individual\r\nCommunists and of communist ideals became too embarrassing to the\r\nleadership, tighter restrictions were reimposed in the late 1950s. The\r\nliterature of the early 1960s has been termed cathartic. By writing\r\nabout long-suppressed thoughts and emotions, writers attempted to purge\r\nthemselves of guilt for the sins of the system that they had supported.\r\nThe poetry, which was very popular with the young, had a ring of\r\ndisillusionment and pessimism.\r\n\r\nThe government leadership did not approve of this literature any more\r\nthan it did of the literature exposing faults in the system. Rather than\r\nrepress the writers as it had done before, the regime used subtle\r\npressures to guide writers into acceptable subjects. What followed was a\r\nwave of naturalistic poetry and novels dealing with purely human\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEATER\r\n\r\nA dramatic tradition was developed as part of the National Revival.\r\nPlays intended to arouse the people's national consciousness were\r\nwritten by Bulgarian authors and staged by students and teachers at\r\nlibrary clubs in several cities (see ch. 11). After independence in 1878\r\nthe National Theater was formed in Sofia, but for several decades it\r\ndepended heavily on foreign plays and foreign theatrical talent. By the\r\nstart of World War II, however, government subsidies had helped to\r\ndevelop it to a point where it compared favorably with national theaters\r\nelsewhere in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe present-day government has heavily supported the theater as a \"mass\r\nschool for the all-round ideological, ethical and aesthetical education\r\nof the people.\" An extensive repertoire of Bulgarian plays conforming to\r\nthe demands of Socialist Realism and to the prescribed content and\r\ninterpretation has been built up. It is performed by some forty-six\r\ntheatrical companies throughout the country. Classics by William\r\nShakespeare, Johann von Schiller, Henrik Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, and\r\nothers are also performed regularly, as are selected contemporary plays\r\nby playwrights from all over the world. Unlike elsewhere in Eastern\r\nEurope, there has been no experimental or avant-garde theater in\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe presentations of the Satirical Theater in Sofia are the most daring\r\nand innovative theatrical presentations available to the public.\r\nAlthough their humor is often biting, their theatrical style seems\r\nrather ordinary and traditional to a Western theatergoer. The Satirical\r\nTheater is, nevertheless, the most popular theater in the country;\r\ntickets for its performances are sold out weeks in advance. In addition\r\nto satirical reviews, the theater presents classical satires by Bertolt\r\nBrecht, Nikolai Gogol, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and others. On the\r\nassumption that \"people who laugh think no evil,\" which is an old\r\nBulgarian proverb, the authorities have tolerated greater outspokenness\r\non the part of Satirical Theater productions than in the more serious\r\nforms of artistic and creative expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILMS\r\n\r\nAs a medium of artistic and intellectual expression, Bulgarian films\r\nhave lagged behind those produced in other Eastern European countries.\r\nThey have received little recognition in the West, where they are\r\ngenerally considered old-fashioned in story line interpretation as well\r\nas in technical approach. Several attempts at imitation of the\r\nsurrealism of Alain Resnais and Louis Bunuel or of some of the other\r\ncontemporary Western cinematic directors, have proved failures in the\r\neyes of the critics at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nIn common with other communist filmmakers, those in Bulgaria have\r\nconcentrated for years on the suffering of the people under Nazi\r\noppression during World War II. Most of these films about war and\r\nresistance have a propaganda purpose that outweighs any efforts toward\r\nartistic or technical excellence. Since the late 1960s most feature\r\nfilms have focused on contemporary life and its problems. It is these\r\nfilms that have shown some experimentation in contemporary cinematic\r\ntechniques on the part of Bulgarian directors.\r\n\r\nAnimated cartoon shorts have been better received by Western critics and\r\naudiences than have feature films. Those designed and directed by Ivan\r\nAndonov, who is also one of Bulgaria's leading actors, have been\r\nacclaimed as outstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC\r\n\r\nBulgaria is best known in the world of music for several renowned opera\r\nsingers it has produced in the twentieth century. The bassos Boris\r\nKhristov and Nikolai Ghiaurov, in particular, rank among the great\r\nsingers of all time. A number of other singers are known on opera stages\r\nin Europe and the Soviet Union. The country's five opera companies\r\nprovide a good training ground for young singers. The opera repertoire\r\nrelies heavily on the classics and on contemporary compositions of\r\nnon-Bulgarian origin; there are few Bulgarian operas. Nevertheless,\r\nopera is an extremely popular form of musical entertainment,\r\nparticularly among the intelligentsia.\r\n\r\nThe interest in and love of opera among Bulgarians probably has its\r\nroots in Eastern Orthodox Church music, which abounds in both the vocal\r\nand dramatic elements characteristic of opera. Bulgarian clerics made\r\nconsiderable contribution to the development of this music during the\r\nMiddle Ages through the introduction of certain rhythmic and structural\r\nqualities that give orthodox ecclesiastical music its characteristic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe most typical form of musical expression through the ages has been\r\nfolk music. Through folksongs the Bulgarian language and cultural\r\nheritage were kept alive during the centuries of Turkish rule. Turkish\r\ninfluence is evident, however, in the musical quality of Bulgarian\r\nfolksongs, which are noticeably Middle Eastern in feeling. Although\r\nthere are many gay dances and happy songs in the folk repertoire, an\r\nimportant segment of folk music has a sad, plaintive quality and sings\r\nof the hardships and grief of daily life.\r\n\r\nBulgarian concert music is not well known outside the country. It is,\r\nhowever, regularly performed by Bulgarian orchestras and has found its\r\nway into the repertoire of orchestras in the Soviet Union and other\r\ncommunist countries. Outstanding among contemporary composers is Pancho\r\nVladigerov, whose compositions were well received both before and after\r\nthe Communists came to power.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s the Bulgarian press noted a growing interest in\r\npopular music among the youth. Dance bands and popular ensembles\r\nproliferated in the high schools and youth clubs. Although the press\r\npraised this interest in music as constructive, it decried the kind of\r\nmusic that found most popularity. Instead of heroic \"mass songs\" of\r\nBulgarian composers, the youth showed interest only in Western popular\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLK ARTS\r\n\r\nA rich legacy of folk arts was developed before and during the five\r\ncenturies of Turkish rule. On Sundays and festival days and at the end\r\nof ordinary workdays, young and old in the villages would gather to\r\ndance the intricate steps of the _horo_ (a circular group dance) and to\r\nsing about young love, brave men, Turkish oppression, or mythical beasts\r\nwith strange features. Flutes, bagpipes, and simple stringed instruments\r\naccompanied the songs and dances.\r\n\r\nHistory and tradition were passed on from generation to generation\r\nthrough legends, ballads, proverbs, and cautionary tales. This folklore\r\nhas formed the basis of much of Bulgarian literature and art since\r\nindependence from the Turks.\r\n\r\nOther forms of folk arts were woodcarving, highly colored embroidery,\r\nrug weaving, and icon painting. Although distinct in their regional\r\nvariations, the traditional costumes of Bulgarian peasants are simple\r\nand drab when compared to those of other parts of Europe. Because any\r\nwealth or material possessions were subject to Turkish confiscation,\r\nBulgarian peasants strove to present an image of poverty through simple\r\ndress and housing.\r\n\r\nIn common with other Eastern European governments, the Bulgarian\r\ngovernment has striven to support and promote the traditional folk arts\r\nas part of the cultural heritage of the people. Artisan co-*operatives\r\nproduce carved woodenware, rugs, weavings, embroideries, and traditional\r\nmusical instruments for sale in government shops. Numerous folk dance\r\ngroups give performances at local tourist centers and abroad. The\r\nvarious folk arts have been free from restriction even during periods of\r\nstrict cultural controls; therefore, they have afforded the best outlet\r\nfor individual creativity of the serious artists as well as the folk\r\nartists.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING AND SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nThe golden age of Bulgarian art was, without doubt, the Middle Ages. No\r\nart since that time has matched the magnificence and quality of the\r\nicons and frescoes that adorn the churches and monasteries constructed\r\nduring that period. Some of the best and most prized examples of\r\nByzantine painting are found in the Boyana Church near Sofia, in the\r\nZemen Monastery in the mountains along the Yugoslav border, and in\r\nseveral other small village churches. A masterpiece of early Bulgarian\r\nart is the icon of Saint Theodor of Plateina near Preslav; it was made\r\nof colored faience in the tenth century. True to the Byzantine style,\r\nmedieval Bulgarian art used muted colors, mostly the earthy tones of\r\nyellows and browns, to depict somber saints and other religious figures.\r\n\r\nSome of the Bulgarian painters developed a special style known as the\r\nTurnovo School of art. In addition to decorating churches and\r\nmonasteries, Turnovo School artists also painted miniatures to\r\nillustrate chronicles and religious texts. Several of these are\r\npreserved in major European museums.\r\n\r\nWoodcarving, silversmithing, goldsmithing, and other crafts also reached\r\na high level of artistry in medieval Bulgaria. Human and animal figures\r\nwere common motifs in carved wooden doors and other architectural\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nMedieval creativity came to an abrupt halt with the Turkish invasion,\r\nwhich not only prevented new artistic expression but also destroyed and\r\ndamaged much of the existing art. Not until the National Revival of the\r\nnineteenth century did Bulgarian artists again begin to express their\r\ncreativity in painting and sculpture.\r\n\r\nModern Bulgarian art had its beginning in the national awakening and\r\nthe struggle for independence of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth\r\ncenturies. As in literature, National Revival art found its themes in\r\nthe beauty of the countryside, the charm of old customs, traditional\r\nfolktales, and the heroic deeds of brave men. Stylistic inspiration came\r\nfrom peasant art and ancient Bulgarian religious art. Most significant\r\namong revival artists were Nikola Pavlovich and Vladislav Dospevaki, the\r\nformer for his introduction of Western-style realism and the latter for\r\nhis modernization of church art. As a whole, however, National Revival\r\nart is more significant for its historic role than for its artistic\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of independence, the simplicity of National Revival\r\nart gave way to an academic style and to impressionism. Best known in\r\nthat period was Ivan Murkvichka, a Bohemian by birth, whose most\r\nappreciated paintings dealt with peasant life. He founded the Academy of\r\nFine Arts in Sofia and organized the first Bulgarian art exhibit.\r\n\r\nAfter World War I Vladimir Dimitrov, known as The Master, sought to free\r\nBulgarian painting from the influence of ethnography and literature,\r\nalthough he too drew upon village motifs. Mainly a painter of people--in\r\nindividual portraits or in group compositions--he concentrated on themes\r\nof family life and peasant work. Since World War II Dimitrov has been\r\nhailed as a great revolutionary humanist whose stylized epic and lyrical\r\nworks depict the greatness of the people and of their suffering.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Dimitrov, the interwar period saw the formation of a\r\ngroup of young painters, led by Ivan Milev, who broke away from routine\r\nacademic composition and advocated the combination of national with\r\nmodernistic elements. At this time also, Alexander Bozhinov developed\r\ncartoon caricature as an art form to be used as a political weapon.\r\n\r\nContemporary art has been guided by the strictures of Socialist Realism\r\nas interpreted at different times. Because national or peasant art is\r\nalways acceptable under these restrictions, artists have used it as an\r\navenue for greater freedom of expression. The influence of peasant\r\nicons, for instance, can be seen in the work of many contemporary\r\nartists. Peasant motifs, such as the fruits of the earth, are also\r\nevident in much of the work. The art most acceptable to the leadership,\r\nhowever, has been the kind of realism that Westerners associate with\r\ncommunist art. Typical of this style is Ilia Petrov's _Partisan Song_, a\r\nmonumental canvas depicting a group of partisans triumphantly singing\r\nafter a victory over fascists. Petrov has consistently received official\r\npraise for his work, which is seen as \"national in form and socialist in\r\ncontent.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Zhivkov's more liberal cultural policy in the\r\n1960s, artists began to show greater variation and creativity in style\r\nwhile retaining the acceptable subject matter for their work. Many\r\nexperimented with abstracts and other avant-garde forms, but these\r\nworks were never selected for public showing or purchase by the museums\r\nand other state agencies, which are the only significant patrons. The\r\nartist, therefore, is usually forced to divide his efforts between those\r\nworks that will earn a living and those that will give vent to his\r\ncreative urge.\r\n\r\nAlthough nonrepresentational art is not publicly exhibited, a\r\nconsiderable degree of abstraction became acceptable in the late 1960s.\r\nAccording to observers who have had contact with Bulgarian artists, the\r\npublic had grown bored with the prescribed style and content of artistic\r\nproduction, and the government could no longer effectively enforce the\r\nrestrictions. Added to the difficulties of enforcement was the\r\nincreasing exposure of Bulgarians through tourism to the great variety\r\nof contemporary art produced in Western Europe and in some of the other\r\ncommunist countries. The most abstract and avant-garde painter in\r\nBulgaria is Genko Genkov, some of whose paintings hang in the National\r\nGallery in Sofia.\r\n\r\nGraphic artists have been allowed the greatest freedom for abstraction.\r\nBy its very nature, graphic art tends to be abstract and stylized.\r\nGraphic artists such as Maria Nedkova have succeeded in producing works\r\nthat are highly regarded both by the government and by the avant-garde\r\nintelligentsia. Many graphic artists go back to Bulgarian medieval art\r\nfor inspiration in theme and style. Pencho Koulekov, for instance, who\r\nis highly regarded in Bulgaria, uses the primitive two-dimensional\r\nperspective, the simplification of forms, the highlighting of the\r\nessential, and the omission of all detail that was characteristic of\r\nearly miniaturists and icon painters.\r\n\r\nUntil the time of independence, sculpture was represented almost\r\nexclusively by decorative wood carvings. With the introduction of\r\nWestern influences, several artists turned to the use of stone. Few\r\nBulgarian sculptors achieved international fame, however, although the\r\nwork of some professors of fine arts in Sofia were becoming known\r\noutside the country. Among them was the noted woodcut artist, Vasil\r\nZakhariev, and a former director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Ivan\r\nLasarov.\r\n\r\nThe three-dimensional nature of sculpture and the classic Greek\r\ntradition of literal representation have made it difficult for\r\ncontemporary sculptors to break away from the realistic representational\r\nrequirements of the regime. Only sculptures designed for children's\r\nplaygrounds and parks are allowed a degree of abstraction characteristic\r\nof art created by children themselves. Observers have commented that\r\nworks considered highly modern in Bulgaria are completely traditional\r\nand representational to the Western eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nThe architectural tradition of Bulgaria is formed on ancient Thracian,\r\nGreek, and Roman architecture of which examples survive in several\r\nparts of the country. Three periods stand out in the development of\r\ndistinct architectural styles over the ages. The first period was the\r\nMiddle Ages, when Bulgarian and other architects constructed some of the\r\ngreat examples of early Byzantine architecture in territories that\r\nconstituted the First Bulgarian Kingdom (see ch. 2). Many of these\r\nmonuments are no longer within the boundaries of Bulgaria--notably the\r\nchurches and monastery in the Lake Ohrid region of Yugoslavia--and\r\nothers were destroyed during the centuries of Turkish rule. Among those\r\nthat have survived within the confines of the country are some of the\r\nbest examples of artistic expression and technology of the Byzantine\r\nperiod. These are a source of great pride for Bulgarians, who consider\r\nthem part of their contribution to world culture.\r\n\r\nThe next period of outstanding architectural development was the\r\nNational Revival period of the late eighteenth century and the\r\nnineteenth century. Flourishing commerce gave new life to such towns as\r\nPlovdiv and Turnovo and created new urban centers in which affluent\r\nmerchants and artisans built homes and public buildings in a richly\r\nornamented style that came to be known as the National Revival style.\r\nThese two-story structures made extensive use of stone and wood, the\r\nlatter usually elaborately carved. The interiors were light and\r\nspacious. In addition to carved doors, ceilings, and built-in\r\nsideboards, the interiors were often decorated with wall paintings.\r\nTypical of National Revival architecture is the Rila Monastery; its\r\ninterior walls are covered with frescoes, and its interior and exterior\r\nabound in carved wooden structural members and decorative details. The\r\nmonastery, like other National Revival structures, reflects the\r\nByzantine influence in the many large arched windows, arched ceilings,\r\nand arcades.\r\n\r\nThe third period of distinguished architectural development is the\r\ncontemporary one. Industrial growth since World War II and a rapidly\r\ngrowing tourist industry since the mid-1950s have called for large-scale\r\nconstruction of needed facilities. New resort towns arose on the Black\r\nSea; industrial new towns grew in other locations; and hotels, apartment\r\ncomplexes, and public buildings were needed throughout the country.\r\nAlthough much of the architecture imitates the colossal style of\r\nStalinist work, some of it is of high artistic quality and imagination.\r\nThe Balkantourist Hotel in Turnovo and several hotels in Black Sea\r\nresorts are often singled out as outstanding examples of modern\r\narchitecture; they combine traditional features with modern materials\r\nand techniques and blend them into a design that fits into the natural\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nSeveral young architects have achieved international reputations by\r\nwinning major design competitions in different parts of the world.\r\nWinning designs have included plans for the development of the city\r\ncenter of Closure, in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany),\r\nand the city center of Tunis, and the redesigning of the Civic Center\r\nPlaza in San Francisco. Since the 1960s the most talented young\r\narchitects have been spending some time in Western Europe to expand\r\ntheir knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIP AND SCIENCE\r\n\r\nIsolated for five centuries from the main currents of intellectual and\r\nscientific developments abroad and denied the education required to\r\nundertake any scholarly or scientific activity of their own, the\r\nBulgarian people do not have a long tradition of scholarship and\r\nscience. Some intellectual activity did take place in the isolated\r\nmountain monasteries, and it eventually inspired the National Revival.\r\nBecause of this isolation, however, the focus of the intellectual\r\nactivity was parochial.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences was founded in 1869 as part of the National\r\nRevival movement and has served, together with the University of Sofia,\r\nas the rallying point of intellectuals and scholars. After World War II\r\nthe Academy of Sciences was expanded by the incorporation of several\r\nindependent research institutions. Its membership was also vastly\r\nincreased with the admission of individuals whose loyalty to the new\r\ngovernment would assure the proper slant to their scholarly work. The\r\nAcademy of Agricultural Sciences was founded in 1961 to provide the\r\nscientific know-how that would expand the output of collectivized\r\nagriculture. The two academies coordinate and supervise all research and\r\nscholarly activity undertaken in the country.\r\n\r\nEmphasis in all scholarly and scientific activity has been on matters\r\ndirectly applicable to industrial and agricultural development. Work in\r\nthe social sciences has been directed at the government's efforts to\r\ntransform Bulgaria into a socialist state. The work of scientists and\r\nscholars must conform to the various theories and formulas developed by\r\nSoviet scholars and must not dispute or contradict the basic precepts of\r\nMarxism-Leninism as interpreted by the Bulgarian leadership. In the\r\nearly 1970s scholarly activity in Bulgaria had not yet attained the\r\nfreedom of thought and expression that has been evident in Poland and\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II. POLITICAL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is a socialist state with a form of\r\ngovernment not too different from the Soviet model on which it was\r\npatterned. Following the classical Marxist-Leninist ideology, it\r\nsubscribes to rule by the working class--that is, dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat--a doctrine asserting that all power emanates from the\r\npeople and is exercised by them through the electoral process. Corollary\r\nto this right of the people to elect national representatives is the\r\npower to recall them through the same instrument of the ballot. In\r\npractice, however, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been a\r\ndictatorship of the communist party.\r\n\r\nThe government has its theoretical base in the constitution adopted in\r\n1971, which superseded the earlier version of 1947. The 1971\r\nConstitution provides for a representative unicameral legislature known\r\nas the National Assembly, an executive committee within the legislature\r\ncalled the State Council, and a cabinet of advisers known as the Council\r\nof Ministers. For regional and local government the constitution\r\nestablishes a hierarchical structure of people's councils. Parallel to\r\nthe entire governmental structure there exist corresponding levels of\r\nthe Bulgarian Communist Party (Bulgarska Komunisticheska Partiya--BKP,\r\nsee Glossary) and, in practice, the party leadership at each level\r\nexercises executive and legislative control.\r\n\r\nThe 1971 Constitution, unlike the 1947 document, explicitly sanctions\r\nthe leadership of the BKP. Its preamble unequivocally proclaims the\r\nleading role of the BKP in the government machinery as the directing\r\nforce in promoting socialist goals and in actively participating in the\r\nfraternity of friendly socialist countries. Particularly noteworthy is\r\nthe statement of recognition of Bulgaria's alignment with the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe 1971 Constitution also recognizes the representation of\r\nmulti-interest groups within the united Fatherland Front (Otechestven\r\nFront), a coalition of left-of-center political groups, which had its\r\norigins during World War II. The front has become a large umbrella for\r\nmass organizations and is headed by the National Council of the\r\nFatherland Front, which functions under party auspices. As constituted\r\nin 1973, the front remained a control mechanism or, more appropriately,\r\na transmission belt for the BKP.\r\n\r\nThe drafters of the 1971 Constitution of Bulgaria subscribed\r\nto Lenin's principle of unity of power, which advocated combined\r\nlegislative-executive authority in one state organ of power. In the\r\n1970s the State Council had assumed legislative initiative as well as\r\nexecutive responsibility, whereas the National Assembly, which was\r\nconstitutionally endowed with the legislative authority, followed the\r\nlead of the State Council.\r\n\r\nGovernment is structured on two levels: national and local. The highest\r\nlegislative body, according to the constitution, is the National\r\nAssembly, which meets only three times a year in very short sessions.\r\nExecutive direction at the national level comes from the State Council,\r\nwhich theoretically is elected by and responsible to the National\r\nAssembly. In effect, however, the council has become a superior body.\r\nBecause the National Assembly meets infrequently, the State Council\r\nassumes legislative initiative in addition to its executive\r\nresponsibility. The third major organ at the national level, referred to\r\nin the constitution as the government, is the Council of Ministers,\r\nwhich is theoretically appointed by and responsible to the National\r\nAssembly but is actually responsible to the State Council. National\r\npolicy decisions reach the grass roots level through the pyramidal\r\nsystem of people's councils.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary, although independent in theory, is an integral part of\r\nthe government structure that operates as an adjunct of the\r\nexecutive-legislative organs. By design the judicial system legitimizes\r\ncommunist control and gives legal expression to party policy. The system\r\nis structured so that the courts of law and the prosecution agency\r\nfunction together, and the latter enjoys police power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of constitutional government in Bulgaria date back to\r\n1879 after Russia had liberated the country from 485 years of Turkish\r\nrule. From 1879 to 1947 the country was governed by a constitutional\r\nmonarchy based on the Turnovo Constitution, which established a\r\nparliamentary system of government having a king at its head. Among\r\ncomparable constitutions in Europe at the time, the Turnovo document was\r\nconsidered liberal and democratic in form, organization, and operation.\r\nIt was considered to be one of the most liberal in the world at that\r\ntime. Whereas most European countries limited suffrage in various ways,\r\nall Bulgarian citizens over the age of twenty-one enjoyed the franchise.\r\n\r\nThrough a sixty-five-year span, however, the Turnovo Constitution was\r\nrevised twice, suspended twice, and violated many times. Basic to these\r\nconflicts was the limit on the power of the king and the extent of\r\npopular participation in government. The absence of consultative bodies\r\nin a unicameral legislature served to widen the rift between the\r\nexecutive and legislative branches.\r\n\r\nEven after the communist takeover in 1944, the Turnovo Constitution\r\ncontinued to be the charter of government until a new constitution was\r\nadopted in December 1947. In party historiography the 1947 Constitution\r\nis described as the work of Georgi Dimitrov, hence it became known as\r\nthe Dimitrov Constitution and remained in force until 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1947\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1940s, with the ascendancy of the BKP in the Fatherland Front\r\ncoalition government, there arose a need to draw up a new charter. The\r\nchanges in government structure and operation had rendered the Turnovo\r\nConstitution obsolete, and the BKP was anxious to discard those elements\r\nthat party ideologists considered bourgeois.\r\n\r\nStructurally the Constitution of 1947 consisted of eleven chapters and\r\n101 articles without a preamble. It proclaimed Bulgaria a people's\r\nrepublic with a representative form of government to be implemented by\r\nuniversal suffrage of citizens eighteen years of age and over.\r\n\r\nThe constitution established the National Assembly as the supreme organ\r\nof the state power and the Council of Ministers as the supreme executive\r\nand administrative organ. During the twenty-four-year span of the 1947\r\nConstitution, the Presidium of the National Assembly actually wielded\r\nmore power than its parent organization or the Council of Ministers,\r\neven though such power was not ascribed to it in the Constitution. The\r\npower of the presidium derived from the BKP positions concurrently held\r\nby its members.\r\n\r\nLegislative power was vested in a unicameral legislature, the National\r\nAssembly, which was elected for a term of four years. Assembly\r\nrepresentatives were elected by the people on the basis of one\r\nrepresentative for every 30,000 people; amended in 1961 to 25,000.\r\nRepresentatives served terms of four years but could be recalled at any\r\ntime before the expiration of their terms. The constitution required the\r\nassembly to meet twice a year and on other occasions as required by its\r\npresidium, which met in continuous session.\r\n\r\nThe many functions of the National Assembly included electing the\r\npresidium, Supreme Court judges, and the chief prosecutor; appointing\r\nthe Council of Ministers; amending the constitution; granting amnesties;\r\ndeciding the holding of referenda; voting on the general economic plan;\r\nsettling questions of war and peace; and other legislative matters of\r\nnationwide application.\r\n\r\nWithin the assembly the presidium--consisting of a president, two vice\r\npresidents, a secretary, and fifteen members--was empowered with\r\nlegislative-executive authority, and it exercised judicial power in the\r\ninterpretation of laws that were binding on everyone. More importantly,\r\nthe presidium assumed the powers and functions of the National Assembly\r\nwhen the latter was not in session. In effect, the small presidium\r\nexercised the legislative function most of the time.\r\n\r\nExecutive and administrative direction was vested in the Council of\r\nMinisters, a cabinet elected by the National Assembly. The council\r\nconsisted of a chairman, several deputy chairmen, the heads of various\r\ncommissions having ministerial rank, and the ministers. The council was\r\nassigned the tasks of directing and administering the various ministries\r\nthat were concerned with the economy as well as with affairs of state;\r\nthe State Planning Committee; the State Control Committee; and the\r\nCommittee on Art and Culture; as well as the Committee on Science,\r\nTechnical Progress and Higher Education. In practice, the council\r\nimplemented policy decisions of the party leaders who were its\r\nhigh-ranking officers.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Soviet model, the first secretary of the party was also\r\nthe chairman of the Council of Ministers and, as such, was the country's\r\npremier. It became evident through the years that the Council of\r\nMinisters and the Presidium of the National Assembly were the ultimate\r\nsources of governmental authority because legislation they proposed was\r\nusually implemented by decree and approved, after the fact, by the\r\nNational Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe 1947 Constitution treated the economic and social structure of the\r\ncountry extensively. It subscribed to collective ownership of the means\r\nof production; defined rules of national economic planning and social\r\nwelfare; empowered the government to nationalize trade, industry, and\r\ntransportation; expropriated land where necessary; and restricted\r\nownership of private property--all in the interest of the state. The\r\nconstitution also gave the state the prerogative to establish monopolies\r\nover production and trade.\r\n\r\nBelow the apex of the governmental pyramid lay the wide base of local\r\ngovernments. These consisted of district and communal people's councils\r\nexercising authority through their executive committees, which sat in\r\ncontinuous session. The executive committees of the people's councils\r\ncooperated closely with local party groups, and personnel were often\r\nconcurrently members of executive committees and local party committees.\r\nAlthough the organization of local government was revamped in 1949, in\r\n1951, and in 1959, by the mid-1960s it was replaced by twenty-seven\r\ndistricts plus Sofia, which became a territorial administrative unit.\r\nThe decentralizing of governmental authority to the local organs of\r\nstate power was designed to bring about greater efficiency and better\r\nsupervision in matters of political, economic, and cultural interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1971\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1971 was the result of the work of the Tenth\r\nBulgarian Communist Party Congress, which was held April 20-25, 1971, in\r\nSofia. This congress also produced a new program for the BKP, made\r\nchanges in statutes, elected the Central Committee of the Bulgarian\r\nCommunist Party, and adopted \"Directives on the Socio-Economic\r\nDevelopment of the People's Republic of Bulgaria during the Sixth\r\nFive-Year Plan (1971-75).\"\r\n\r\nThe draft of the new constitution was presented for nationwide\r\ndiscussion on March 30, 1971, just three weeks before the opening of the\r\ntenth BKP congress. The congress approved the draft in its entirety on\r\nthe opening day of session. The constitution was approved through a\r\npopular referendum on May 16 and was proclaimed law two days later by\r\nthe National Assembly. General elections under the new law took place on\r\nJune 27, 1971.\r\n\r\nThe structure and functioning of the different organs of state power as\r\noutlined in the Dimitrov Constitution remained essentially the same\r\nexcept that the State Council became a more powerful governmental body\r\nthan the Presidium of the National Assembly that it replaced and, in\r\neffect, overshadowed the Council of Ministers in authority. The new\r\ndocument continues to define Bulgaria as a people's republic but also\r\nrefers to its socialist character and to its membership in the\r\ninternational community of socialist states. Two new features are the\r\ndeclaration of principles in the preamble and the sanction given to the\r\nleadership of the BKP, aided by the Bulgarian Agrarian Union (also\r\ncalled the Agrarian Party) within a united Fatherland Front (see ch. 9).\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1971 reflects the new changes in the sociopolitical\r\nand socioeconomic development of the country as viewed by the communist\r\nleadership. The first chapter consists of twelve articles that briefly\r\ndefine the political philosophy upon which the constitution is based and\r\nthe direction in which the party expects the country to move under the\r\nnew charter. Simply stated, the philosophy avows that Bulgaria is \"a\r\nsocialist state of the working people of town and country, headed by the\r\nworking class,\" and \"the guiding force in society and the state is the\r\nBulgarian Communist Party.\" The direction of movement expected by the\r\ncountry's leadership is evidenced by the assertion that \"the socialist\r\nstate shall promote the evolution of the socialist society into a\r\ncommunist society.\" This chapter also affirms the Marxist-Leninist\r\nprinciples that underlie the functioning of the state and the society.\r\n\r\nThe new document also addresses itself to significant changes in the\r\ninterrelationships between the National Assembly, State Council\r\n(formerly the presidium), and the Council of Ministers. For instance,\r\nthe constitution expanded the right of legislative initiative to include\r\nnot only the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers but also the\r\nState Council, the permanent commissions of the National Assembly, the\r\nSupreme Court, the chief prosecutor, and the district people's councils.\r\nThe rationale was that the National Assembly is not a continuously\r\nsitting body so that its functions must, of necessity, be assigned to\r\nstate bodies of a permanent nature.\r\n\r\nTwenty articles explain the economic system and development of the\r\nrepublic based on the socialist ownership of the means of production.\r\nThe constitution recognizes four kinds of ownership: state, cooperative,\r\npublic organizations, and individual or personal.\r\n\r\nThe Law on Citizen's Property passed during the session of the National\r\nAssembly in March 1973, however, nearly abolished the private ownership\r\nof the means of production which, according to communist theory, is the\r\nbasis for the exploitation of man by man. The new measure gave legal\r\nexpression to what had been planned since the constitution was\r\npromulgated in 1971 and reflects the complete predominance of collective\r\nownership in furtherance of the spirit of the tenth BKP congress.\r\nPrivate ownership is confined to \"items for personal use.\"\r\n\r\nBasic rights and liberties of citizens get constitutional guarantees,\r\nbut in almost every stipulation that hinges on personal, civil, and\r\npolitical rights, in practice, the interest and welfare of the state\r\ntake precedence. Basic rights and obligations embrace a wide scope of\r\npersonal, civil, and political freedoms. Among these guarantees are the\r\nright to Bulgarian citizenship; civil rights of spouses, parents, and\r\nchildren; rights to work, rest, and receive health care and free\r\neducation; freedoms of speech, press, association, and demonstration;\r\nrights to secrecy of correspondence and communication except in cases of\r\nnational emergency; and freedom of worship. All citizens are declared to\r\nbe equal before the law regardless of national origin, creed, social\r\nstatus, education, or sex. Article 36 extends to women equal rights with\r\nmen. Mothers are guaranteed all-expense-paid hospitalization and\r\nmaternity care, paid maternity leave of absence, and provision for\r\nchildren's care in nurseries and other establishments provided by the\r\ngovernment. The protective arm of the state also extends to its citizens\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\nRights have commensurate obligations defined by the constitution to\r\nensure the survival and strengthening of the socialist foundation.\r\nForemost among these are the obligation to work according to one's\r\nabilities, the defense of the state, compulsory military service, and\r\ntax obligations for state support. Treason and other high crimes against\r\nthe state, such as inciting war and disseminating propaganda, are\r\ntreated with severity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe Central Government\r\n\r\nThe constitution exhibits an image of legislative supremacy asserting\r\nthat power belongs to the people and is exercised through such elected\r\nrepresentative bodies as the National Assembly and the people's\r\ncouncils. The practice, however, shows executive political hegemony\r\nexercised by the party leadership occupying positions of governmental\r\nresponsibility, such as the head of the Council of Ministers and head of\r\nthe State Council. The power exercised by a government organ is\r\ndirectly linked to the party positions held by its head and by its\r\nmembers. For example, Todor Zhivkov as president of the State Council (a\r\nposition that automatically makes him president of the republic) is at\r\nthe same time first secretary of the party and a member of its\r\nPolitburo. Stanko Todorov, who is chairman of the Council of Ministers\r\nand thereby premier of the republic, is also a member of the Politburo.\r\nSeveral other members of the State Council and the Council of Ministers\r\nare concurrently members of the Politburo, the Secretariat, or the\r\nCentral Committee. This interlocking of positions, which occurs not only\r\nat the national level but at all levels, ensures party control of the\r\nentire governmental system (see fig. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nState Council\r\n\r\nThe source of executive direction and control in the government is the\r\nState Council, a twenty-four-man executive committee within the National\r\nAssembly elected for an indefinite term until a new National Assembly\r\nelects a new council. It functions as a collegial executive and\r\nlegislative body, and its president assumes the title of president of\r\nthe People's Republic of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe State Council of the National Assembly replaced the former\r\npresidium, to which the 1947 Constitution had given honorific titles but\r\nlargely ceremonial functions. Conceived during a plenum of the party\r\nCentral Committee in 1968 but not established until after the\r\npromulgation of the new constitution in 1971, the State Council was\r\ndesigned to be a powerful force, both executive and legislative, in the\r\noverall governmental structure. The best evidence to the power inherent\r\nin the structure of the new State Council was the fact that party leader\r\nZhivkov chose to relinquish the premiership, which he had held for\r\nseveral years, in favor of the newly created position of president of\r\nthe State Council. Zhivkov is one of a very few leaders of communist\r\ncountries who continues to retain the top position in both the party and\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe State Council exercises a wide spectrum of authority that would\r\ntheoretically be the responsibility of the National Assembly. In effect\r\nthe State Council becomes the alter ego of, or a surrogate for, the\r\nNational Assembly and arrogates to itself the constitutional\r\nprerogatives of the people and the elected legislature. Most members of\r\nthe State Council are concurrently high-ranking members of the BKP.\r\n\r\nAmong the many duties and responsibilities of the council, the most\r\nimportant can be divided into two definite groups: those functions that\r\nare specifically defined and thereby permanent and those functions that\r\nthe council assumes when the legislative body is not in session. During\r\nwartime, when it might not be possible for the assembly to meet, the\r\nconstitution provides for the complete assumption of legislative and\r\nexecutive authority by the State Council.\r\n\r\nThe State Council's specific and permanent functions include, among\r\nothers, calling the National Assembly into session, exercising the\r\nright of legislative initiative, determining bills that should be\r\nsubmitted to the people for nationwide discussion, interpreting the laws\r\nand decrees binding on everyone, creating and eliminating departments\r\nbelow ministerial level, appointing and recalling diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives, granting Bulgarian citizenship, ratifying international\r\ntreaties concluded by the government, and implementing the general\r\ndirection of the defense of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 6. Bulgaria, Structure of Government, 1973_]\r\n\r\nWhen the National Assembly is not in session, the State Council is\r\nempowered to promulgate decrees and other acts of legal validity dealing\r\nwith problems arising from laws and decrees of the legislative body.\r\nFurthermore, these acts and decrees have the force of law and need no\r\nlegislative confirmation at the next assembly session.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the council exercises executive control over the Council\r\nof Ministers, its members, the local people's councils, and the Office\r\nof the Chief Prosecutor; it can repeal decisions of the ministries and\r\nother central departments, which in effect reduces the Council of\r\nMinisters to a grade below the State Council. In the event of war the\r\nState Council, in the absence of the National Assembly, is empowered to\r\nsign peace treaties, to amend the constitution, to grant amnesty, and to\r\nchange the territorial boundaries of the country. In sum, the functions\r\nof the State Council can be categorized into executive, legislative,\r\njudicial, and police. In carrying out these multifarious\r\nresponsibilities, six councils and two committees assist the State\r\nCouncil, (see fig. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers is described in the constitution as \"a supreme\r\nexecutive and administrative body of state power.\" In practice the\r\ncouncil is more of an advisory body to the State Council than it is a\r\nsupreme body even though it oversees the day-to-day functioning of the\r\ngovernment. In 1973 the council consisted of a chairman (the premier),\r\ntwo first deputy chairmen, five deputy chairmen, twenty ministers, and\r\nseveral chairmen of committees subordinate to the council. Additionally,\r\nthere are other members in the council; they are ministers without\r\nportfolio (two) and the deputy chairman of the State Control Committee.\r\nWithin the council there is an inner executive committee known as the\r\nBureau of the Council of Ministers; its membership includes the\r\nchairman, his seven deputies, the minister of finance, and the chairman\r\nof the State Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nElection and organization of the Council of Ministers is done by the\r\nNational Assembly, which determines the number, kind, and names of the\r\nministries and of other departments with ministerial rank. For this\r\nreason the number of ministries and central agencies may vary from time\r\nto time. The Constitution of 1971 introduced two new features that did\r\nnot exist in the 1947 Constitution. One obliges the Council of Ministers\r\nto give an accounting of its work to the State Council and another\r\nlimits the rights of the Council of Ministers over the executive\r\ncommittees of the people's councils.\r\n\r\nSome of the functions of the Council of Ministers overlap those of the\r\nState Council. Categorically, these functions may be grouped together as\r\nexecutive, legislative, economic (budget preparation), police, and\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers also has jurisdiction to form--for the purpose\r\nof administration--committees, councils, general boards, and offices.\r\nAlso within their competence, ministers and heads of departments with\r\nministerial rank have the right to issue orders and rescind unlawful or\r\nirregular acts and actions of the special bodies of the people's\r\ncouncils. They also have the right to suspend acts of the executive\r\ncommittee of the people's councils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 7. Bulgaria, Organization of the Council of\r\nMinisters, 1973_]\r\n\r\nThe constitution empowers the Council of Ministers to draft and\r\nimplement national economic plans for submission to the National\r\nAssembly. The council has police power in the maintenance of public\r\norder and security and has general command of the armed forces. Along\r\nwith the State Council it implements the direction and control of the\r\nactivities of the people's councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly, a unicameral legislature, is the only legislative\r\nbody of the central government, but legislative initiative has been\r\nextended to several other governmental organs. In practice the State\r\nCouncil appears to be the most powerful organ of government as well as\r\nthe principal initiator of legislative matters. The assembly, which\r\nmeets only three times each year in short sessions, would appear to have\r\nmore form than substance in the actual governmental affairs of the\r\ncountry. It would seem to be impossible for anyone to become a member of\r\nthe assembly or of the State Council without prior approval of the BKP\r\n(see ch. 9).\r\n\r\nThe assembly's 400 members represent voting districts of equal numbers\r\nof inhabitants per delegate. The term of office is five years. This was\r\nanother innovation in that the BKP hierarchy decided that party\r\ncongresses would be held every five years instead of four and,\r\ntherefore, elections to the National Assembly should be changed in the\r\nsame manner. In the exercise of its functions, the National Assembly can\r\ndissolve itself, and in emergency situations it may extend its term.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the National Assembly operates, that is, the\r\ninfrequency and brevity of sessions, makes it imperative for permanent\r\ncommissions, in addition to the State Council, to carry on the\r\nmultifarious functions of the assembly. In 1971 there were twelve\r\npermanent commissions, half of which had overlapping functions with\r\nvarious ministries. The constitution does not specify how many permanent\r\nor interim commissions the assembly should appoint but leaves such\r\nmatters of organization to the assembly itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Government\r\n\r\nTerritorially, Bulgaria is divided into twenty-eight districts\r\n(_okruzi_; sing., _okrug_), about 200 municipalities, and about 5,500\r\nvillages. The municipalities, if size warrants, are divided into urban\r\nconstituencies (_rayoni_; sing., _rayon_), whereas villages are usually\r\ngrouped together to form rural constituencies known as _obshtini_\r\n(sing., _obshtina_). Since 1959 the number of districts has remained\r\nconstant at twenty-eight, which includes one for the city of Sofia. The\r\nnumber of urban and rural constituencies, on the other hand, changes\r\nfrequently as the population increases and as people move from the\r\ncountryside to the cities or move from cities to suburban areas.\r\nDistricts and urban and rural constituencies are governed on the local\r\nlevel by people's councils, and in the 1971 elections there were almost\r\n1,200 such councils with a total of more than 53,000 elected officials.\r\n\r\nEach people's council has an elected executive committee, which is\r\nconstantly in session and which acts for the council during the long\r\nperiods when the full body is not meeting. On the local level the\r\nexecutive committee is to the people's council what the State Council is\r\nto the National Assembly on the national level. An executive committee\r\nusually consists of a chairman, a first deputy chairman, several deputy\r\nchairmen (depending on size), and a secretary. The interlocking of party\r\nand governmental positions that is the hallmark of the central\r\ngovernment is repeated at the district and rural and urban constituency\r\nlevels, and often the members of a people's council executive committee\r\nare also the most prominent members of the local party organization. An\r\nexecutive committee usually serves for the entire term of its people's\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nIn the implementation of national policy, people's councils are under\r\nthe supervision and control of higher councils all the way up to the\r\ncentral government. The hierarchical and pyramidal structure of the\r\npeople's councils, wherein the lowest bodies are subject to the\r\ndirection of the next higher and of the highest bodies, is an example of\r\nthe application of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism.\r\nCoincident with this structure of government is the parallel structure\r\nof the BKP, whose members are in control or are influential at every\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nPeople's councils are empowered to adapt decisions and orders of higher\r\nauthorities to their own individual needs. Local councils prepare plans\r\nand budgets in consonance with the national plans and, after decisions\r\nhave been made at the national level, the local councils conform to the\r\nnational policy. People's councils are involved in the day-to-day\r\naffairs of their constituencies in government services and\r\nadministration, the maintenance of public order, the protection of state\r\nand communal property, and the protection of the rights of its citizens.\r\nIn these areas the local police, known as the People's Militia, are the\r\ninstruments of the local council, but their responsibility is also to\r\nthe next higher level and on up to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (see\r\nch. 15).\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nThe highest judicial organ is the Supreme Court, the members of which\r\nare elected by the National Assembly for five-year terms. Below it are\r\ntwelve regional and ninety-three district courts, and the military\r\ncourts. The Supreme Court is a court of original jurisdiction as well as\r\nof appellate jurisdiction. It is organized into criminal, civil, and\r\nmilitary divisions. In the administration of justice, courts and\r\nprosecution are referred to as \"weapons of the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat.\" Judges and assessors take part in the dispensation of\r\njustice. These positions are elective.\r\n\r\nThe Office of the Chief Prosecutor is established to see that the laws\r\nare obeyed by the ministries and other national departments, bodies of\r\nlocal state power, economic and public organizations, and officials as\r\nwell as citizens. The chief prosecutor is elected to a five-year term.\r\nHe is subject to recall, however, before the expiration of his term and\r\nis responsible only to the National Assembly. Again, as is true with the\r\nSupreme Court, between sessions the chief prosecutor reports to the\r\nState Council.\r\n\r\nThe chief prosecutor exercises wide powers in the performance of his\r\nfunctions. Because he is elected by the National Assembly, he is certain\r\nto be a loyal party member; he appoints prosecutors (district and\r\ncommunal) for lower levels and can recall them before the expiration of\r\ntheir terms. Together with the minister of justice, he controls the\r\njudicial system for the communist party.\r\n\r\nIn interpreting the communist theory of \"unity of power,\" the\r\nconstitution places the judiciary below the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of state power. It also lumps together the judicial bodies and\r\nprosecutors in overlapping and parallel functions. The fact that judges\r\nand lay assessors are elected indicates that the party echelons can\r\ncontrol the workings of the judicial machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTORAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nThe basic election law of Bulgaria is embodied in a document adopted on\r\nFebruary 17, 1953, and published as the Law of Election for the National\r\nAssembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. It has been amended many\r\ntimes since then.\r\n\r\nArticle 6 of the 1971 Constitution extends the right to vote to every\r\nBulgarian citizen who has reached the age of eighteen, regardless of\r\n\"sex, nationality, race, creed, education, occupation, official or\r\nsocial status, and property status.\" The only exceptions are those\r\npersons under \"complete tutelage.\" An earlier law had denied the right\r\nto vote only to those who had been sentenced by a court.\r\n\r\nMembers of both national and local representative bodies--the National\r\nAssembly and the people's councils--are elected by direct and secret\r\nballot on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage.\r\nTheoretically, they are responsible to their electorate and render an\r\naccounting of their activities. In this frame of reference they can be\r\nsubject to recall even before the expiration of their term. In practice\r\nthey are removed at the discretion of the BKP.\r\n\r\nThe State Council schedules dates for elections to the National Assembly\r\nand people's councils. In no case is the date fixed later than two\r\nmonths after the expiration of the current mandate. The council is also\r\nempowered to schedule dates for holding referenda on decisions of the\r\nNational Assembly. All election dates are set on weekends or nonworking\r\ndays to ensure continuous work production.\r\n\r\nUnder the election law and in accordance with the constitution,\r\nelections are called by the State Council and conducted by the Central\r\nElection Commission, a body created by the National Assembly and\r\ndirected by the State Council. The Central Election Commission comprises\r\nrepresentatives of various organizations, such as trade unions,\r\ncooperatives, youth organizations, special professional and interest\r\ngroups, and other public organizations and societies, which must be duly\r\nregistered according to acceptable procedures established by the\r\nNational Assembly. The election commission is headed by an executive\r\ncommittee consisting of a chairman, a deputy chairman, a secretary, and\r\ntwenty members, all of whom must be approved by the State Council.\r\n\r\nCorollary to the right to elect is the right to be elected to public\r\noffice. Candidates are nominated according to electoral areas.\r\nTheoretically, the right to nominate candidates is secured through\r\nmeetings of public organizations and such societies as trade unions,\r\nyouth organizations, cultural societies, and cooperatives. In practice,\r\nhowever, candidates are nominated by the BKP leadership of these public\r\norganizations, and their names are submitted for discussion during\r\nmeetings. This procedure ensures the candidates' election and at the\r\nsame time meets the obligation in the electoral law that nominations be\r\ndiscussed at public meetings.\r\n\r\nLists of candidates for public office are compiled in each village,\r\ntown, and district and are submitted to the BKP-controlled National\r\nCouncil of the Fatherland Front where a final list of candidates is\r\ndrawn. Only candidates nominated by the BKP, the Bulgarian Agrarian\r\nUnion, and other mass social organizations approved by the Fatherland\r\nFront are allowed to go on the ballot. Quite expectedly, the single\r\nslate of candidates presented by the Fatherland Front usually gets\r\nelected unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn the parliamentary election held on June 27, 1971, voters elected\r\nassembly deputies, people's councillors, judges, and lay assessors. Out\r\nof 6,168,931 registered voters, 6,159,942 cast ballots, representing\r\n99.85 percent of the electorate. A total of 6,154,082 voters, or 99.9\r\npercent, voted for all Fatherland Front candidates as contrasted to\r\n1,487 who voted against. About 4,373 election ballots were declared void\r\nbecause of irregularities.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which election results are tallied and announced was\r\nexemplified by the election of 1971. Two days after the election the\r\nCentral Election Commission--headed by its chairman, Angel\r\nVelev--examined the protocols of the 400 urban constituency election\r\ncommissions and announced the results. As expected, all 400 candidates\r\nnominated by the Fatherland Front were elected. Announcements of local\r\nelection results in towns and villages are made by the respective\r\nexecutive committees of the people's councils.\r\n\r\nThe BKP's method of organizing the government after an election was\r\nillustrated by the plenum of the Bulgarian Communist Party's Central\r\nCommittee held on July 6, 1971. It discussed and approved proposals for\r\ncandidates for chairman and deputy chairman of the National Assembly,\r\nmembership of the State Council, Council of Ministers, heads of the\r\ndifferent commissions, chairman of the Supreme Court, and chief\r\nprosecutor. Nominees were submitted for discussion and confirmation\r\nduring the first session of the sixth National Assembly held on July 7,\r\n1971.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the 1971 Constitution on the nomination of candidates by\r\nthe leadership of public organizations obtained official sanction not\r\nonly for the purpose of expediency but more importantly to guarantee the\r\nelection of the nominees, as there had been cases of nonelection during\r\nthe previous elections for people's councils. The election law also\r\nprovides that candidates must garner 50 percent plus one vote in the\r\nelectoral districts before being declared elected. Statistics of\r\nelection results for people's councils in 1949 and 1966 showed that the\r\npercentage of votes ranged from 96.48 percent of the voting population\r\nin 1949 to 99.56 percent in 1966. The new amendment required that\r\ntwo-thirds of the registered voters cast their ballots in favor of the\r\ncandidates before declaring that an election had taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DYNAMICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 political affairs and the administration of the country\r\nremained completely in the hands of the ruling circle of the Bulgarian\r\nCommunist Party (Bulgarska Komunisticheska Partiya--BKP, see Glossary),\r\nheaded by First Secretary Todor Zhivkov. Political power was exercised\r\nby him and by the few select officials in the Central Committee of the\r\nBulgarian Communist Party, particularly those who were members of the\r\nPolitburo and the Secretariat. The extent of such power was best\r\ndescribed by Vulko Chervenkov, onetime premier and Politburo member, who\r\ndeclared that \"no institution, organization, or person can be above the\r\nPolitburo and the Central Committee.\" This statement, made in the early\r\n1950s, continues to be the cardinal rule of communist power in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nRetention of power by the party was ensured through its absolute control\r\nof governmental machinery and of all organized activities. Virtually\r\nevery important government post was held by a high-ranking party member.\r\nFirst Secretary Zhivkov, for example, was also president of the State\r\nCouncil, the leading government body, which made him the top man in both\r\nparty and government. In addition to the interlocking of government and\r\nparty posts at all levels, it was also customary for the top officers of\r\nmass organizations to be members of the party hierarchy. The continued\r\nexistence of a second political party, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union\r\n(Bulgarski Zemedelski Suyuz--BZS), did not encroach on the\r\nmonopolization of political power by the BKP because the prerogatives of\r\nthe union had been curtailed to the point where it had become an\r\nauxiliary of the BKP rather than a competitor. Any opposition to the\r\nruling elite had come from within the party rather than from outside\r\norganizations. As recently as 1965 an abortive attempt to overthrow\r\nZhivkov was made, but this was the result of intraparty factionalism\r\nrather than antiparty opposition. Zhivkov managed to avert the attempted\r\ncoup d'etat and afterward strengthened his power base within the party.\r\n\r\nAt the helm of the party for nineteen years, Zhivkov, despite occasional\r\nintraparty struggle and friction, remained the undisputed leader and, as\r\nsuch, he maintained very close relations with the Communist Party of the\r\nSoviet Union and with the Soviet government. On the one hand the close\r\nBulgarian-Soviet relationship has been interpreted by Marxist\r\ntheoreticians as the application of \"proletarian internationalism\"--a\r\ntheory that contends that proletarian unity is \"historically the higher\r\nright than that of national self-determination.\" On the other hand, many\r\nobservers of Bulgarian-Soviet relations maintain that the nature of the\r\nunequal alliance stems not only from historical and cultural\r\naffiliations as well as political and ideological identification but,\r\nmore important, from Zhivkov's need for strong Soviet support.\r\n\r\nAt the Tenth Party Congress in 1971 Zhivkov reiterated the necessity for\r\nclose ties with the Soviet Union and introduced a five-year economic\r\nplan that continued the long emphasis on heavy industry. The congress\r\nreelected the Politburo, despite the advanced ages of some of the\r\nmembers and their demonstrated concern for maintaining the status quo at\r\na time when the changes necessary to transform Bulgaria into a modern\r\nindustrial country have placed new demands on old methods and\r\ninstitutions. Success or failure of the Communists' ongoing efforts to\r\nindustrialize, modernize, and communize the country depends on the\r\nadaptability of the leadership and the political institutions to meet\r\nthe challenges of the 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, 1965-71\r\n\r\nAfter discovery of the plot to overthrow him in April 1965, Zhivkov took\r\nsteps to secure his position and to prevent future conspiracies. Because\r\nthe threat to his regime had come mainly from the army, Zhivkov and his\r\nminister of defense often spoke to assemblies of military officers to\r\nexplain party policies and to assuage dissident feelings within military\r\nranks. In addition, state security functions were realigned in an\r\nattempt to tighten the system in order that such conspiracies would not\r\nbe able to germinate in the future. The Ministry of the Interior lost\r\nits responsibility for security to the newly created Committee of State\r\nSecurity, which was under the direct supervision of Zhivkov in his\r\nposition as premier. Later, in 1968, the Committee of State Security and\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior were again merged under the latter's title.\r\n\r\nAfter the abortive plot against him, Zhivkov offered some reforms to\r\nplacate disgruntled elements and to avoid a repetition of the incident.\r\nAlthough the principal plotters were imprisoned, Zhivkov's reaction to\r\nthe conspiracy was one of general appeasement. This policy of\r\nappeasement was shown by the fact that no general purges took place and\r\nthat people who could have been suspected of dissident activity were\r\nallowed to remain in positions of authority in the party and in the\r\ngovernment rather than being summarily swept aside. The programs of\r\nliberal reform that had been implemented before, but interrupted by, the\r\n1965 plot were resumed, and Bulgaria seemed to be reaching for a\r\nnational destiny rather than accepting the role of a Soviet puppet. The\r\nreforms affected all fields--political, economic, and cultural--and for\r\na time it seemed that the abortive coup d'etat had given new impetus to\r\nBulgarian national interests.\r\n\r\nThe promise of reform appeared to be the focal point around which the\r\nNinth Party Congress was convened in 1966, and at the congress party\r\nleaders underscored the need for the widest participation in the\r\ndemocratic process. Reforms, however, fell victim to the conservatism of\r\nolder party leaders, and Zhivkov did not have the personal strength or\r\nmagnetism to push forward his program. The ninth congress ended with the\r\nreelection of the essentially reactionary Politburo and a reaffirmation\r\nof the status quo. The bright hopes for economic, political, and social\r\nprogress that had been evident in late 1965 and early 1966 collapsed in\r\na return of rigid ideological dogma and a firm reliance on Soviet rather\r\nthan Bulgarian initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the ninth congress to rejuvenate the party hierarchy and\r\nto chart a reform course for the future had repercussions throughout\r\nBulgarian society. Initiatives in foreign affairs that had been taken in\r\n1965 and 1966 foundered in the retrenchment into party orthodoxy.\r\nNegotiations that had begun with Western European countries as well as\r\nwith Balkan neighbors bore no fruit as the Zhivkov government failed to\r\nfollow up earlier moves toward better relations. Even more detrimental\r\nto Balkan relations was Bulgarian participation in the Soviet-led\r\ninvasion of Czechoslovakia, which Yugoslavia and Romania strongly\r\nopposed. In the cultural area the party tightened its controls over\r\ncreative artists and reorganized the Committee on Art and Culture to\r\nbetter serve the needs of the government. The First Congress of Culture,\r\nheld in 1967, emphasized the constructive role of culture in society and\r\ncalled for an intensification of anti-Western propaganda in order to\r\ncounter the dangerous influence of so-called bourgeois culture.\r\n\r\nThere was also great concern among party leaders about the so-called\r\nnihilistic attitude of the country's young people. In December 1967\r\nZhivkov published his \"Youth Theses\" in an attempt to counter what the\r\nparty considered to be dangerous apathy on the part of Bulgarian youth.\r\nZhivkov's theses initiated some institutional reforms that dealt heavily\r\nwith patriotic education in an attempt to instill some national pride in\r\nthe young people, but about a year later patriotic education was\r\ndeemphasized. Evidently the program had aroused strong feelings of\r\nnationalism that interfered with the pro-Soviet attitudes that have been\r\ncharacteristic of Zhivkov's government. After publication of the \"Youth\r\nTheses,\" all youth activities came under the aegis of the Dimitrov\r\nCommunist Youth Union (Dimitrovski Komunisticheski Mladezhki Suyuz),\r\nreferred to as Komsomol, which is the junior auxiliary of the BKP. The\r\nmoves to politicize young people failed to arouse any widespread\r\ninterest, and in the early 1970s Bulgarian youth remained essentially\r\napolitical and apathetic.\r\n\r\nIn the economic sector the BKP blueprint for reform commonly referred to\r\nas the New Economic Model offered innovations in decentralized\r\ndecisionmaking that delegated more responsibilities to public and state\r\norganizations on the lower level as well as to individual enterprises.\r\nThe attention given to economic reform at the time--late 1965--was\r\nmotivated not only by Zhivkov's need to shore up his own political\r\nposition after the attempted coup but probably more so by the examples\r\nof new economic programs that were sweeping the Eastern European\r\ncommunist countries and the Soviet Union. More important than the\r\nliberal reforms for decentralized management of the economy was the\r\ndecision to allow planning from the bottom to the top. From the time of\r\nthe enactment in 1965 up to about 1968 there were definite signs of\r\nchange. The July plenum of the BKP Central Committee in 1968, however,\r\nformalized a number of changes that called for considerable reduction in\r\nthe autonomy of the existing public and state organizations, thus\r\nsetting aside the entire economic reform program. After the July plenum\r\nand another in November 1968, a reorganization of state enterprises took\r\nplace in line with the new centralization policy.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Zhivkov's\r\nposition remained stable, and there were no overt threats to his regime\r\nsuch as the 1965 plot to overthrow him. In 1969 and again in 1970\r\nagreements were signed in Moscow that tied the Bulgarian economy even\r\ncloser to that of the Soviet Union. Bulgaria's position, or more\r\nprecisely the BKP's position, on relations with the Soviet Union was\r\nsummed up in a statement made by Zhivkov just before the Tenth Party\r\nCongress in 1971: \"The fraternal friendship and cooperation of the\r\nBulgarian Communist Party with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\r\nand the ever broader and deeper alignment of Bulgaria with the Soviet\r\nUnion will remain the immovable cornerstone of the entire work and the\r\ndomestic and foreign policy of our party.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Tenth Party Congress, which was attended by General Secretary\r\nLeonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, there were no startling changes\r\neither in party policy or in high-ranking personnel assignments. The\r\nsame Politburo, with an average age of sixty-three, was returned to\r\noffice, and the party program promised no alteration in the heavily\r\ncentralized, pro-Soviet policies that had marked most of Zhivkov's\r\ntenure. A new constitution was proposed by the party and later adopted\r\nby the government and, although some institutional changes were\r\nmade--for example, creation of the State Council as a collective\r\nexecutive branch of government--the absolute supremacy of the BKP over\r\nevery aspect of Bulgarian life was in no way diminished. On the\r\ncontrary, the power of the top leadership was probably enhanced along\r\nwith its ability to perpetuate itself in office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nParty statutes define the organization, membership, and program of the\r\nBKP. A statute promulgated during the Sixth Party Congress in 1954\r\nproclaimed the party to be an \"inseparable part of the world communist\r\nfront\" and acknowledged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the\r\nleading political force within the communist bloc countries. Later party\r\nstatutes refined the basic document but did not change the premise that\r\nthe BKP looks to the Soviet party for leadership.\r\n\r\nCentral to the observance of basic communist policy is adherence to the\r\nprinciples of democratic centralism. Patterned after the Soviet model,\r\nthese principles call for a pyramidal form of command responsibility in\r\nwhich lower party organs are subordinated to the next higher body. This\r\nalso means that decisions of higher bodies bind those below,\r\nindividually and collectively. Party policy and practice encourage open\r\ndiscussion of issues during meetings of local party units as well as\r\nduring conferences and congresses at higher levels; however, party\r\ndiscipline requires unitary action after a decision has been reached by\r\nthe hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe party hierarchy is composed of the Politburo, the Secretariat and,\r\nto some extent, the Central Committee, the membership of which interlock\r\nas one man may occupy two or more positions at any given time.\r\nTheoretically occupying the apex of power is the congress of the party\r\nthat is held every five years, following the example of Soviet party\r\ncongresses. The congress is made up of delegates from various party\r\nunits on the basis of proportional representation of party members. The\r\nmain statutory functions of the congress include revising or amending\r\nparty statutes, deciding party policy, electing the Central Committee,\r\nand receiving reports concerning past progress and future plans. It is\r\ncustomary for major governmental programs or reforms to be presented to\r\na party congress before promulgation. The Tenth Party Congress, for\r\nexample, listened to readings of the draft of a new constitution and the\r\nSixth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) and approved both unanimously. Actually,\r\nthe purpose of a congress is to demonstrate unanimity and accord. The\r\nsize of the congress (1,553 delegates in 1971) and the fact that it\r\nmeets only at five-year intervals preclude carrying out its statutory\r\nrole as a deliberative and policymaking body. Public politicking or\r\nwrangling by delegates to a party congress would be unprecedented.\r\n\r\nBecause the party congress meets so infrequently, it delegates its\r\nfunctions to the Central Committee that it elects. Election of Central\r\nCommittee members is also a pro forma action wherein the congress\r\nunanimously approves the list of names provided by the party leadership.\r\nThe Central Committee is a large working party organ, which in 1973\r\nincluded 147 members and 110 candidate (nonvoting) members. The\r\ncommittee is charged with the administration of party work between\r\nsessions of the congress and the implementation of party policies\r\npresented by the leadership. For the performance of its duties, the\r\nCentral Committee has fourteen permanently operating departments and six\r\nschools and institutes, the latter ostensibly to promote political\r\neducational goals. As set forth in party statutes, plenary sessions of\r\nthe committee are to be held at least twice a year, and special sessions\r\nmay be called from time to time.\r\n\r\nWithin the Central Committee sits the nine-man permanent Secretariat\r\nheaded by the first secretary who, by party structure, is the most\r\npowerful man in the country. The Secretariat is elected by the Central\r\nCommittee during the party congress, but the election, once again, is\r\nmerely formal approval of the members already selected by the top party\r\nleadership. Since 1954 the position of first secretary has been\r\ncontinuously held by Zhivkov, who also heads the State Council and is\r\ntherefore the head-of-state. In addition to the first secretary, six\r\nother secretaries and two members complete the composition of the\r\nSecretariat. The main function of the Secretariat is to supervise the\r\nimplementation of party policy.\r\n\r\nSharing the center stage of political power with the Secretariat is the\r\nPolitburo, elected by the Central Committee in the same manner as the\r\nSecretariat. In effect the Politburo is a self-perpetuating body, and\r\nany change in membership is dictated by the members themselves. Composed\r\nof eleven members and six candidate members, all Politburo members\r\nbelong to the Central Committee. They provide collective political\r\nleadership in both party and government.\r\n\r\nThe Politburo is the policymaking and decisionmaking branch of the\r\nparty. In theory the eleven members of the Politburo are equal, but in\r\npractice the party first secretary occupies the topmost position of\r\npower in the party and is therefore first among equals in the Politburo.\r\nSuch is the concentration of political authority in the top bodies that\r\nmultiplicity of membership by party officials in any or all of the\r\ncentral party organs is more the rule than the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership\r\n\r\nAfter the successful coup d'etat in September 1944, communist party\r\nmembership grew with unprecedented speed. From prisons and internment\r\ncamps and from self-exile abroad, party leaders began to converge in\r\nSofia to restructure the party and to form a new government. Party\r\nmembers assisted by sympathizers helped fill the necessary manpower\r\nrequirements as functionaries and working groups in the new coalition\r\ngovernment. A period of intensive recruitment and propaganda followed\r\nthat swelled the number of members from 15,000 to 250,000 in just four\r\nmonths. By the time the Fifth Party Congress convened in December 1948,\r\nparty membership reached 500,000. This was in part due to the merger of\r\nthe Social Democrats with the BKP in August 1948. In large part,\r\nhowever, Bulgaria's egalitarian peasant society--coupled with\r\nindiscriminate recruitment using hardly any criteria for\r\nqualification--produced a predominantly peasant membership. Workers\r\naccounted for slightly over one-fourth of the total membership as\r\ncompared to one-half made up of peasants.\r\n\r\nIronically, the intense campaign for new members was accompanied by\r\nwide-scale purges within the party during a power struggle between the\r\nStalin faction and the home faction of the BKP. Led by Chervenkov, the\r\nMoscow-oriented leaders succeeded in getting rid of their political\r\nopponents and soon after established a Stalinist kind of government in\r\nthe country. Observers noted that this was aimed not only at weeding out\r\nundesirable party elements but, more important, at increasing the number\r\nof workers and consequently achieving a numerical balance with the\r\npeasant members.\r\n\r\nOnce in full control of the party and government, the BKP hierarchy\r\nturned its attention to more systematic methods of recruitment. By the\r\ntime the Eighth Party Congress convened in November 1962, the BKP had\r\n528,674 members plus 22,413 candidates. It was also at about this time\r\nthat the Zhivkov government relaxed the open police terror and pardoned\r\n6,000 political prisoners, most of them Communists.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Party Congress, held in November 1966, provided new\r\nregulations concerning party composition and acceptance of new members.\r\nQualifications of candidates had to be checked thoroughly, and only\r\nthose qualified could be accepted. Education as the main criterion of\r\nselection was emphasized among target groups of workers, peasants,\r\nspecialists, women, and young people. As a result of this improved\r\nrecruitment procedure, the new members after the congress were 44.3\r\npercent blue-collar workers and 32 percent women. Of this group, it was\r\nestimated that 60.4 percent had at least a secondary education.\r\n\r\nIt was reported by the Secretariat that district (_okrug_) party\r\ncommittees after the Ninth Party Congress showed improvement in\r\n\"content, style and methods of their work,\" and that they understood\r\nbetter the political approach in guiding local economic tasks as well as\r\nleading primary party organs in the political and organization work of\r\ntheir constituencies. Furthermore, over 77 percent of full-time\r\nsecretaries of local party committees and about 90 percent of chairmen\r\nof cooperative farms had higher or secondary education. Formal training\r\nas well as in-service education was given serious attention. Educational\r\ntraining for party members includes two-year university courses, short\r\ncourses, seminars, informal meetings, and conferences of local party\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nStatistics reported in 1971 showed that 25.2 percent of about 700,000\r\nmembers of the BKP were women. Increasingly more important positions\r\nwere assigned to women in the party hierarchy. In the same period (1971)\r\nthere was a woman member of the Politburo, several women members of the\r\nCentral Committee, and two women ministers. Not only were women active\r\nin party activities, but they could also be found in boards of\r\nmanagement of government enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\nParty Congresses\r\n\r\nParty statutes formerly stipulated that congresses would be held every\r\nfour years, but a decision was made to extend the interval to five years\r\nafter the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had made the same change.\r\nDecisions of the congresses appear as party statutes that usually\r\nreflect the desires of the leadership and the circumstances that\r\nnecessitated the additions, deletions, or amendments to already existing\r\nstatutes. The most important innovations embodied in BKP statutes\r\nemerged from congresses beginning with the Sixth Party Congress, held in\r\n1954, and continuing through the Tenth Party Congress, held in 1971.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Party Congress abolished the position of general secretary and\r\nin its place created the post of first secretary, again following the\r\nlead of the Soviet party, which had done the same thing after Stalin's\r\ndeath a year earlier. Party leader Chervenkov, who was premier and a\r\nPolitburo member, kept those posts and allowed the election of Zhivkov\r\nas first secretary. Zhivkov was then an unknown functionary who had\r\nrisen from the ranks of the Sofia party structure. Aside from the usual\r\nexhortation for party unity and the changes in six Politburo positions\r\nas well as an increase in Central Committee membership, the Sixth Party\r\nCongress was uneventful. Zhivkov's rise to power did not take place\r\nimmediately, and a period of intraparty struggle ensued as he gradually\r\nconsolidated his authority as first secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Party Congress, held in June 1958, proved even more\r\nuneventful. It passed the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of\r\nthe economy, the fulfillment of which was drastically reduced to three\r\nyears even before the ink was dry on the document. With Central\r\nCommittee approval, new plans for economic targets were prepared;\r\nmeanwhile, Zhivkov prepared an elaborate propaganda campaign to push\r\nthis program through. Zhivkov's Theses, as the collection of\r\ninstructions have come to be known, advocated increased cultivation and\r\nproduction in agriculture and industry to obtain yields that were double\r\nthose of previous plans. An unprecedented flurry of activity followed on\r\nthe heels of extensive media coverage. Aided by the press, the Agitation\r\nand Propaganda Department under the Central Committee's direct\r\nsupervision launched a vast campaign that surpassed even those efforts\r\nin neighboring countries.\r\n\r\nThis period is characteristically known as Bulgaria's Great Leap\r\nForward, patterned after the Chinese experience, and historians put\r\nforth political and economic motives for such an economic experiment.\r\nPolitically, after Nikita Khrushchev started his de-Stalinization policy\r\nin the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian repercussion was evident in\r\nChervenkov's disenchantment with the Soviet trauma and his looking\r\nfavorably instead toward the Chinese example. The Great Leap Forward was\r\nneither a spectacular success nor a dismal failure and achieved no more\r\nthan the expected progress in three year's time. The ensuing period\r\nmarked a return to earlier patterns and heralded the end of Chervenkov's\r\npolitical career and the concurrent elevation of Zhivkov. The election\r\nof Zhivkov's friends--Stanko Todorov and Mitko Grigorov--to full\r\nmembership in the Politburo gave him added support. Khrushchev's visit\r\nas the head of a large Soviet government delegation did not hurt Zhivkov\r\nbut rather gave convincing proof of Khrushchev's support of the\r\nBulgarian first secretary. Anton Yugov was premier at this time, but it\r\nwas not long before he too was purged, the final blow coming only hours\r\nbefore the start of the Eighth Party Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Party Congress in 1962 marked the end of the open opposition\r\nto Zhivkov's leadership. With Chervenkov and Yugov out, Zhivkov was in\r\nfull control. A month earlier, in October 1962, a special plenum of the\r\nCentral Committee announced Zhivkov's assumption of government power as\r\npremier while retaining the first secretaryship of the party. In the\r\neconomic sector, the Twenty-Year Plan of Economic Development--patterned\r\non that of the Soviet Union--had been passed. It featured more realistic\r\ngoals in contradistinction to its predecessor. As usual, heavy\r\nindustrial priorities ranked high in the development plan.\r\n\r\nIn November 1966 the Ninth Party Congress was held in Sofia. During the\r\ndeliberations changes were made within the Politburo whereby Zhivkov's\r\nformer protégé, Grigorov, was dropped from membership without an\r\nexplanation and Todor Pavlov, a theoretician of Marxism, and Tsola\r\nDragoycheva, head of the National Council of the Fatherland Front, were\r\nadded as full members. Boyan Bulgaranov and Ivan Mihailov, both older\r\nparty members, were retained--a move that indicated the influence of\r\nolder functionaries over young potential leaders. Economically, the\r\ncongress supported principles of new management, tying political\r\nprogress with economic advancement.\r\n\r\nCollectively the aforementioned congresses accomplished little. On the\r\ncontrary the 1971 congress introduced considerable changes in the\r\nsociopolitical and socioeconomic patterns of growth--among them the\r\ndrafting and adoption of a new constitution (see ch. 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nTenth Party Congress\r\n\r\nWhatever political changes are visible in Bulgaria are the result of the\r\nTenth Party Congress held in Sofia from April 20 to April 24, 1971. It\r\nwas attended by 1,553 delegates representing roughly 700,000 party\r\nmembers, a ratio of about one delegate for every 450 members.\r\nAdditionally, foreign representatives from eighty-nine countries were on\r\nhand. Leading the Soviet delegation were Brezhnev, general secretary of\r\nthe Soviet party, and four other high-ranking officials.\r\n\r\nAs is customary, Zhivkov opened the congress with his usual\r\nstate-of-the-nation address, extolling Bulgarian-Soviet ties and\r\nstressing friendship between the two countries. Included in the agenda\r\nwere the adoption of a new five-year economic plan; discussion and\r\nadoption of the new party program; discussion and approval of the new\r\nconstitution; the election of party members to the Central Committee,\r\nPolitburo, and Secretariat; and a change in party statutes calling for a\r\ncongress every five years instead of four.\r\n\r\nThe central theme of the party congress revolved around the concern or\r\n\"care for man.\" To this end resolutions were passed during the\r\ndeliberations purportedly giving \"everything for the sake of man;\r\neverything for the good of man.\" A separate report on the subject also\r\nemphasized the need for improving the economic plight of the people. By\r\nthe time the resolutions and directives were being implemented, however,\r\nnoticeable variations in interpretation and emphasis had taken place.\r\nFor example, the draft directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan showed\r\nprojection of industrial production that went up by 60 percent, whereas\r\nproduction of consumer goods was projected to increase by only 50\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention was given to the areas of education and culture by the\r\nTenth Party Congress. Zhivkov underscored the need to close the\r\neducational gap between workers and peasants, who often had no more than\r\nan elementary education, and the intelligentsia and white-collar\r\nprofessionals, who had attained the secondary level and more often had\r\ngone on to higher education.\r\n\r\nFar more significant changes in party statutes took place in the area of\r\ngovernmental operations. With the adoption of a new constitution,\r\nmodified structural arrangements were worked out, the most important of\r\nwhich was the creation of the powerful State Council of the National\r\nAssembly; the council's functions are not entirely dissimilar to, but\r\ngreater than, the presidium that it replaced (see ch. 8).\r\n\r\nThe composition of the new Politburo and Secretariat remained\r\nessentially the same. The congress seemed anxious to demonstrate unity\r\nby stressing continuity of tenure for its senior members. All of the\r\neleven Politburo full members elected in 1966 were reelected in 1971;\r\nfour were over age seventy, and the youngest was fifty years old. All\r\nPolitburo members except one had been with the party since before\r\nSeptember 9, 1944. Some Western observers wondered whether the retention\r\nof the entire old guard signified stability or exemplified stagnation.\r\nAt a time when observers were expecting an infusion of new blood into\r\nthe hierarchy, the leaders chose the status quo. Zhivkov, in his closing\r\nspeech, seemingly aware that the political conservatism of the old\r\nruling elite left something to be desired, maintained that \"the\r\ncommunist is ... an official up to a certain age; but he never ceases to\r\neducate, to inspire, to unite, and to organize the masses.\" In effect he\r\napologized for retaining the same old membership in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULGARIAN AGRARIAN UNION\r\n\r\nThe egalitarian character of Bulgaria's society derives from its\r\nbasically agricultural economy. Its peasant organization--the Bulgarian\r\nAgrarian Union (Bulgarski Zemedelski Suyuz--BZS) was formed as early as\r\n1899, making it one of the oldest agrarian organizations in Europe.\r\nFounded to promote the well-being and educational advancement of its\r\nmembers, it developed into a political party and a powerful machine that\r\nin the 1920s became the governing party under Alexander Stambolisky.\r\nAfter Stambolisky's government was overthrown in 1923, it did not rise\r\nto power again. The party split in 1931, and in 1942 the radical half of\r\nthe party, known as the Pladne (the name of their newspaper) faction,\r\njoined the BKP in the Fatherland Front coalition.\r\n\r\nThe BZS in the early 1970s was a secondary political party subservient\r\nto, and controlled by, the BKP. Its membership was reported to be\r\n120,000, of which 80,000 were cooperative farmers and approximately\r\n15,000 were active militants in government jobs. It has a more\r\nsimplified party hierarchy, being governed by an executive council\r\nelected by delegates of its congress, which meets every four years. The\r\nExecutive Council--corresponding to the BKP Central Committee--is\r\ncomposed of ninety-nine members and forty-seven alternate members. From\r\namong them are elected members of the Standing Committee, comparable to\r\nthe Politburo of the BKP, which directs the entire activity of the BZS.\r\nThe Standing Committee derives its authority from the Executive Council\r\nand reports to it.\r\n\r\nAssisting the Executive Council is the Auditing Commission, which\r\noversees the financial accounts of the BZS. Another leading central\r\norgan of long historical tradition is the Supreme Council. It is not as\r\nlarge as the congress, but it is important enough to make policy\r\ndecisions affecting the great mass of agrarian rank and file. It\r\nconsists of all members and alternates of the Executive Council, members\r\nof various commissions, and all the chairmen of district committees.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-eight district committees; 1,027 village committees;\r\nand 3,848 local branches of the BZS below the national level.\r\nJurisdictionally, they all follow an orderly system of organization\r\nwhereby lower organs fall under the supervision and control of higher\r\norgans, and all fall under the final jurisdiction of the BKP agencies\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of the 1971 Constitution recognizes the existence of the\r\nBZS as united in \"purpose and action\" with the BKP in the establishment\r\nand development of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. In keeping with\r\nthis pledge, the BZS leadership and prominent members are elected to,\r\nand in some cases appointed to, important bodies of state administration\r\nthrough all levels of the government. There was an increase in the\r\nnumber of BZS members elected to public office in the general elections\r\nthat followed the BKP congress in 1971. It appeared that the Communists\r\nhad decided during their congress to broaden the base of representation\r\nby including more BZS members in the government as well as more members\r\nfrom various mass organizations and the Turkish minority. Regardless of\r\naffiliation, all candidates for office are carefully screened by the\r\nBKP, and after election all officials are under the control of the BKP.\r\n\r\nOf the national officials in January 1973, Georgi Traykov, leader of the\r\nBZS, was one of two first deputy chairmen of the Fatherland Front.\r\nEarlier, he had been released as chairman of the National Assembly,\r\nwhich approved his nomination to the State Council, a move that was\r\npolitically expedient in the view of Zhivkov to establish a \"closer\r\nrelationship ... between the State Council and the National Council of\r\nthe Fatherland Front.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Thirty-Second Congress of the BZS, held in Sofia in October\r\n1971, the presence of high-ranking BKP Politburo members as well as\r\nforeign delegates was very much evident. Boris Velchev, Politburo member\r\nand secretary of the Central Committee, delivered a speech praising the\r\nwork of the BZS in its partnership with BKP in all aspects of Bulgaria's\r\nsocialist development. Domestically, BZS was lauded for its efforts in\r\nthe technological progress in agriculture resulting in the production of\r\nlarge quantities of cheap produce. BZS members were also praised as good\r\nmachine operators in factories and as \"innovators and frontrankers in\r\nfield brigades and livestock farms.\"\r\n\r\nInternationally, the BZS maintains contacts with dozens of agrarian and\r\nrelated organizations in various countries. As diplomats, national\r\nofficials among the BZS leaders had demonstrated exceptional ability in\r\nforeign relations, especially where the regular high-ranking BKP\r\nrepresentatives had been found less acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASS ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nMass organizations are auxiliaries of the BKP through which the party\r\nhierarchy exerts control over the bulk of the population. Established to\r\nserve the immediate interests of a particular class of workers or\r\nprofessionals, mass organizations work as transmission belts for the\r\nadministration of party policies and the achievement of party goals.\r\nMost, if not all, of their chairmen are trusted and loyal BKP members.\r\n\r\nThe right to form organizations for any purpose not contrary to public\r\nlaw and national security is guaranteed in the constitution. These\r\norganizations may be political, professional, cultural, artistic,\r\nscientific, religious, or athletic. Furthermore, unions and other\r\nassociations may be formed within public organizations and cooperatives.\r\nIn all cases the guidelines set by the BKP for the development of a\r\nsocialist state impose limitations on the operations of mass\r\norganizations. Recognition of the BKP as the leading political party and\r\nthe subservience of all other organizations is clearly understood. The\r\nmost important mass organizations are the Fatherland Front, the Central\r\nCouncil of Trade Unions, and the Komsomol and its affiliate Pioneer\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFatherland Front\r\n\r\nThe Fatherland Front grew out of the internal dissension between the\r\ngovernment and various political parties, in particular, the pro-Soviet\r\nelements who objected to the alliance with Nazi Germany. In March 1942\r\nthe government launched repressive measures in an attempt to immobilize\r\ncommunist activities. Working with a group of exiled Bulgarian leaders\r\nin Moscow, Georgi Dimitrov, former secretary-general of the Communist\r\nInternational (Comintern), urged action against the country's rulers,\r\n\"who have sold themselves to Hitler.\" As conceived by Dimitrov, the\r\nprogram of the Fatherland Front aimed not only to bring down the\r\n\"Hitlerite\" regime and consequently establish a \"true Bulgarian national\r\nregime\" but also to declare Bulgaria neutral and dissolve its alliance\r\nwith Germany.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1942, the Fatherland Front operated underground under\r\ncommunist leadership but also included other political parties.\r\nCooperation among these political parties, however, did not take place\r\nwithout problems, mainly because each one espoused its own particular\r\ninterests and viewed the BKP with suspicion. Leaders of each party\r\nworked as members of the National Committee (later known as the National\r\nCouncil) of the Fatherland Front. It was from within the Fatherland\r\nFront movement that the coup d'etat of September 1944 took place, the\r\nresult of which was a coalition government.\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists took full control of the government and dissolved\r\nthe coalition, they retained the Fatherland Front as an umbrella\r\norganization. The BKP, of course, is the leading force within the front,\r\nwhich also includes the Bulgarian Agrarian Union and several other\r\norganizations. In effect the Fatherland Front is an instrument of the\r\nparty through which most of the country's organized activities are\r\ncontrolled and supervised. Some of the tasks relegated to the front\r\ninclude the nomination and discussion of candidates for election to\r\ncentral and local bodies of state authority; the right to supervise the\r\nactivities of enterprises, institutions, and organizations operating\r\npublic utilities and services; and the right to supervise activities of\r\nworkers and professionals to ensure conformance to party line and\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the Fatherland Front continued to be a large mass organization\r\nworking fully for and with the BKP. Available statistics showed a\r\nmembership of 3.86 million in July 1970, of which 3.1 million were\r\nnonparty members. It included both individual members and collective\r\ngroups--mainly trade unions and youth organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Council of Trade Unions\r\n\r\nTrade unions are workers' and professionals' organizations--the\r\nfunction, role, and responsibility of which echo the economic directives\r\nand decrees of the BKP. With the abolition of capitalist ownership\r\ndeclared by the Fifth Party Congress in December 1948, the structure and\r\nactivities of trade unions changed to conform to the party's management\r\nof the economy as the vanguard of the state in its socialist\r\ndevelopment. Since then the Bulgarian trade unions have been reliable\r\nmainstays and faithful transmission belts of BKP policies among the\r\nworking masses. Thirteen individual trade unions unite to form the\r\nCentral Council of Trade Unions, which accepts the leading role of the\r\nBKP in all Bulgarian affairs. In 1973 total membership in the central\r\ncouncil was about 2.6 million.\r\n\r\nFollowing the principle of democratic centralism, all trade union\r\nofficials are elected from bottom to top but, following the pattern set\r\nby the BKP, all candidates for union offices are carefully screened and\r\nselected by officials at higher levels. Each trade union local is the\r\nbasic organization unit at a factory or business enterprise, and there\r\nis an ascending hierarchical structure based on territorial\r\norganization. At the district level there is a district trade union that\r\nreports to the central organization. Theoretically, the trade unions are\r\nindependent and nonparty, but they are organized hierarchically, and\r\ntheir activities are closely monitored and controlled by the BKP. In\r\neffect, the trade unions look after the interests of the state rather\r\nthan the interests of the workers. To ensure party control there is an\r\ninterlocking of positions in the highest realms of the unions, the\r\ngovernment, and the party. For example, the chairman of the Central\r\nCouncil of Trade Unions in 1973 was also a member of the State Council\r\nof the National Assembly as well as being a candidate member of the\r\nPolitburo. At lower levels many district and local trade union\r\nexecutives are also members of the district and communal people's\r\ncouncils. Under this arrangement the unions take a direct part in the\r\nmanagement of state affairs--such as labor and labor legislation,\r\nrecreational activities, workers' sports, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDimitrov Communist Youth Union\r\n\r\nYoung prospective members of the BKP come from the Dimitrov Communist\r\nYouth Union (Dimitrovski Komunisticheski Mladezhki Suyuz), also referred\r\nto as the Komsomol. Established as the youth's counterpart of the BKP,\r\nit is organized much as the parent structure, having a secretariat of\r\nnine members headed by a first secretary and a bureau of seventeen\r\nmembers and five candidate members that is comparable to the party\r\nPolitburo. The Komsomol is under the leadership of party committees and\r\nis supported by the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of\r\nNational Education, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Bulgarian Red\r\nCross, and the Civil Defense Staff in interlocking roles of authority\r\nand supervision. Founded as a sociopolitical organization to train the\r\nyouth in the ideological principles and goals of the BKP, the Komsomol\r\nalso serves as a source of manpower reserve in government and as an\r\ninstrument for the application of party policies and directives. In the\r\nearly 1970s membership was about 1 million (see ch. 2; ch. 15).\r\n\r\nDespite all the attention given to youth affairs, alienation of young\r\npeople manifests itself in many different ways. There were no tangible\r\nsigns of protest such as outward demonstrations, mass rallies, or\r\ndisruptions during congresses, plenums, annual meetings, or regional\r\nconferences to show this alienation. But the negative attitude and\r\nsagging interest in political indoctrination and economic activities\r\nincreasingly worries party leaders. The ideological and political gap\r\nbetween generations prompted the administration to prepare and publish\r\nZhivkov's \"Youth Theses\" in December 1967. This work is basically an\r\ninspirational treatise to counter what Zhivkov averred was national\r\nnihilism among the youth, characterized by apathy, absence of\r\ndiscipline, improper family upbringing, misdirected school discipline,\r\nand ill-prepared Komsomol programs, among other things. The theses also\r\ndeplored the \"degenerate influences\" of capitalist society that were\r\nevident in conspicuous material consumption in food and beverages,\r\ndress, music and dance, and social mobility brought about by bourgeois\r\naffluence.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to bring the youth back into line, the theses emphasized\r\npatriotic political education within a Marxist-Leninist frame of\r\nreference, defined the duties and privileges of the young people, and\r\nfinally directed the reorganization of the Komsomol under closer party\r\nsupervision. The initial reaction to the theses was one of increasing\r\npassivity.\r\n\r\nIn another effort to court the Komsomol-age group, political speeches\r\nopenly lauding the youth union as the instrument for the realization of\r\nthe technological and scientific as well as the military technical\r\ntraining of young people and their patriotic education have been\r\nresorted to. Further, in extolling the work and importance of the youth\r\nunion to the all-round development of Bulgarian socialist society,\r\nZhivkov also enjoined the youth to implement the Sixth Five-Year Plan of\r\nthe BKP.\r\n\r\nThe organization for Bulgarian children still too young for the Komsomol\r\nis the Pioneers, also known as Young Septembrists to commemorate two\r\nSeptember events in Bulgarian political history--the abortive communist\r\ncoup d'etat in 1923 and the successful overthrow of the monarchy in\r\n1944. The Pioneer organization is composed of children of elementary\r\nschool age. It is structured like the Komsomol and operates as its\r\njunior division. A special division within the Komsomol National Central\r\nCommittee oversees the affairs and work of the Pioneers. Lower\r\ncommittees at the district and municipality levels are directed by the\r\nsoviets for working with students, which are charged with youth work in\r\ntheir respective territorial jurisdictions. Each district has a Pioneer\r\nbattalion that is divided into companies corresponding to school classes\r\nand further subdivided into classroom rows, the lowest unit of Pioneer\r\norganization. The chain of command flows from the central committee and\r\nreaches down to the youngest member of the organization living in the\r\nremotest part of the country. The content of academic curriculum and\r\nparty training is generally in accord with the ability levels of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee of Bulgarian Women\r\n\r\nThere is no mass organization, as such, for Bulgarian women. The\r\nCommittee of Bulgarian Women, with a membership of 171 in 1973, is a\r\ngroup dedicated to looking after the affairs of women in the country,\r\nwhether they be workers or housewives. The Constitution of 1971\r\nguarantees to Bulgarian women the enjoyment of equal rights with men. In\r\nthe complex structure of the BKP-controlled government, recognition of\r\nwomen as a significant working force in the socialist movement is given\r\ngreat attention. An earlier provision contained in the 1947\r\nConstitution, known as the Dimitrov Constitution, similarly guarantees\r\nthe \"right to work, equal pay for equal work,\" and the attendant\r\nbenefits, such as paid leave, social security, retirement pension, and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nBulgarian women have become active participants in the political process\r\nunder communist rule. As noted earlier, 25.2 percent of BKP members in\r\n1971 were women, and there was one woman in the Politburo. There were\r\n7,000 women members of the BZS and almost half of the Komsomol members\r\nwere women (500,000); the same is true for the Fatherland Front, and\r\nwomen made up 41.2 percent of the trade unions. In the unions of\r\nwriters, composers, artists, and actors women are also active. Most\r\nteachers are women. They represented 67.7 percent of the Teachers Union.\r\n\r\nThe women's movement was active on a nationwide scale. On the initiative\r\nof the Committee of Bulgarian Women, a plan for the development of\r\nscience and technical progress including the study of the social role of\r\nwomen was presented to the presidium of the Bulgarian Academy of\r\nSciences. Another suggestion by the same women's group called for the\r\nstudy of conditions defining women's role as \"mothers, production\r\nworkers and public activists.\"\r\n\r\nIn the report to the plenary session of the party Central Committee in\r\nJuly 1968, Zhivkov outlined the functions of the Committee of Bulgarian\r\nWomen. These included the coordination of state and administrative\r\norgans in research institutes that studied the role of women in society.\r\nHenceforth, according to Zhivkov, the Central Committee of the BKP would\r\nreceive reports on such research and would be directly concerned with\r\nmatters concerning Bulgarian women.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeological Training\r\n\r\nHow mass organizations relate to BKP party directives, orders, and\r\ndecrees is best illustrated in the area of political education and\r\nindoctrination. The National Conference on Party Propaganda was held in\r\nApril 1970 and sponsored by the Agitation and Propaganda Department of\r\nthe Central Committee and by the district party committees. During the\r\nconference one of the district secretaries detailed some aspects of a\r\nthree-stage system that is being applied.\r\n\r\nThe three-stage structure corresponds to the educational level as well\r\nas to the political training and age of students. Schools in the higher\r\nlevel of various district party committees and branches of the mass\r\norganizations train administrative personnel, intellectuals, and party\r\nactivists. Training on this level includes theoretical seminars and\r\nstudy groups. For intermediate personnel, including employees with a\r\nsecondary education, there are schools and institutes giving lectures\r\nand talks on Leninism. A more elementary form of mass propaganda is\r\ngiven to people with less training in theoretical political ideology;\r\npeople of advanced age fall also into this category. Political education\r\nfor this group consists of lectures in beginners' schools. Compulsory\r\nsubjects in primary party organizations are also discussed during\r\neducation sessions at party meetings. Except for Sofia, which has a high\r\nrate of literacy, most districts employ this three-stage system of\r\npolitical education. It is estimated that 60 percent of Communists in\r\nSofia have at least a high school education; many have college degrees\r\nin contrast to some outlying districts where a large percentage of the\r\nCommunists have only an elementary education.\r\n\r\nThe three-stage system is also used for training newly inducted\r\nCommunists as well as youth groups. It was reported during the\r\nconference that approximately 900 of the best party propagandists have\r\nbeen sent to Komsomol organizations to train youth in the party school\r\nsystem. Within the Komsomol there is evident need for considerable\r\nchanges in the training of youth in the system of political education,\r\ndesigned to bring the youth closer to the practice of the principles of\r\nMarxism-Leninism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the communist era in Bulgaria, that is, since World War II,\r\nthe foreign policy of the country has mirrored that of the Soviet Union.\r\nIn addition to the close relationship resulting from bilateral\r\nagreements between the two countries, Bulgaria was also a charter member\r\nof both the Soviet-dominated Council for Mutual Economic Assistance\r\n(COMECON--see Glossary) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact)\r\nmilitary alliance. Bulgaria's loyalty to the Soviet Union throughout the\r\nperiod is always a starting point in political writings on Eastern\r\nEuropean affairs.\r\n\r\nThe successive leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see\r\nGlossary) have consistently maintained that their country's fortunes\r\nwould rise with those of the Soviet Union. To the Bulgarian Communists,\r\nsuch loyalty was not only natural from an ideological point of view but\r\nwas also the pragmatic course, given the factors of world power politics\r\nin the postwar era. Todor Zhivkov, the BKP leader since 1954, and still\r\nin office in 1973, continued to adhere to a policy of close alignment\r\nwith the Soviet Union and used the relationship as the foundation of his\r\nregime. The nature of the relationship has developed along two parallel\r\nlines: the BKP has maintained close ties with the Communist Party of the\r\nSoviet Union at the same time that government-to-government affairs have\r\nbecome increasingly intertwined.\r\n\r\nAs is true with other countries in which the communist party has become\r\nthe dominant political force, in Bulgaria the formulation of foreign\r\npolicy takes place at the highest party level--the Politburo. After the\r\nparty has announced the basic policy, the administration of foreign\r\naffairs is handled by government ministries. The government has\r\nrepeatedly dedicated itself to the goals of the world communist movement\r\nand, particularly, to the goal of solidarity among socialist states,\r\nalways acknowledging Soviet leadership. In the Sino-Soviet rift that\r\ndeveloped during the 1960s, Bulgaria continually expressed its\r\nallegiance to Moscow and decried the divisiveness that resulted from\r\npolycentric attitudes and actions.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 Bulgaria maintained diplomatic relations with eighty-two\r\ngovernments, thirty-six of which had embassies in Sofia. The remaining\r\ngovernments carried on diplomatic relations through their\r\nrepresentatives in nearby capitals. Bulgaria maintained fifty-four\r\nembassies in foreign countries and, as a member of the United Nations\r\n(UN), maintained an ambassador and a staff in New York. Bulgaria also\r\nparticipated in the activities of many of the UN special agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nHistorical Factors\r\n\r\nBulgaria emerged from World War II under the control of a coalition\r\ngovernment dominated by the BKP, which by 1947 had arrogated unto itself\r\ncomplete power in the country. In the immediate postwar years policy and\r\ndirection concerning how the BKP should run the country was dictated\r\nfrom Moscow, as was the case throughout most of the countries of Eastern\r\nEurope. Between 1944 and 1948 eight countries had been taken over by\r\ncommunist parties and had aligned themselves with the Soviet Union,\r\nwhich exerted varying degrees of influence in the internal and\r\ninternational affairs of all of them. Over the next twenty years\r\nYugoslavia and Albania broke out of the Soviet orbit completely; the\r\nGerman Democratic Republic (East Germany), Poland, Hungary, and\r\nCzechoslovakia experienced uprisings or civil disorders--in most cases\r\nsuppressed by Soviet force--and Romania asserted its right to national\r\nself-determination on numerous occasions. Bulgaria alone remained\r\nunwavering in its absolute allegiance to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nBulgaria chose not to follow the examples of other Eastern European\r\ncountries in seeking some degree of autonomy during the 1950s and 1960s\r\nfor many reasons. Not least among these were the historic traditions of\r\nfriendship between Bulgarians and Russians dating back to the\r\nRusso-Turkish war that freed Bulgaria from Turkish rule in 1878.\r\nBulgarians are also close to the Russians in language, religion, and\r\ncultural traditions. Additionally, having assumed power, the Bulgarian\r\nCommunists quite naturally looked toward Moscow--then the center of\r\nworld communism--for guidance and support. Many of the early postwar\r\nleaders had spent several years as residents of the Soviet Union, where\r\nthey had been closely associated with the country's party.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the close ties to the Soviet Union was pure\r\npragmatism on the part of the Bulgarian communist leaders. They were, in\r\neffect, a minority leadership group faced with the task of imposing an\r\nalien ideology on a reluctant majority at the same time that they were\r\ntrying to reorient the country's economy from an agricultural base to an\r\nindustrial base. The Bulgarian leaders needed the support of the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nBeset by intraparty strife and lack of success in running the country\r\nafter the death of Georgi Dimitrov--the leading Bulgarian communist hero\r\nand strong man of the early postwar years--the party leadership again\r\nclung to Soviet support and totalitarian rigidity to perpetuate itself\r\nin power. Even after the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and the\r\nlater de-Stalinization program under Nikita Khrushchev, Bulgaria's\r\nleaders retained Stalinism as a modus operandi until the early 1960s.\r\n\r\nAfter Zhivkov became first secretary of the party in 1954, there was a\r\nlong power struggle, for a third time, and it was not until the early\r\n1960s that Zhivkov managed to eliminate his major antagonists from the\r\nparty hierarchy and stabilize his regime. During all of those years and\r\non through the 1960s and into the 1970s, Zhivkov continued the policy of\r\nabsolute loyalty to the Soviet Union and to its leadership.\r\nConsequently, Bulgarian foreign policy has been a mirror image of Soviet\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Foreign Policy\r\n\r\nBulgaria's constitution, in describing how the state serves the people\r\nin foreign affairs, mentions \"developing and cementing friendship,\r\ncooperation, and mutual assistance with the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics and the other socialist countries\" and \"pursuing a policy of\r\npeace and understanding with all countries and peoples.\" Official\r\nspokesmen proclaim that the country's international relations are\r\nfounded on the necessity for protecting national sovereignty and on the\r\ncreation of an overall attitude that would further the cause of all\r\nnations in their development as modern states.\r\n\r\nA quotation from the party program developed for the Tenth Party\r\nCongress in 1971 indicates that, as far as Bulgaria's leaders are\r\nconcerned, the Soviet Union leads and Bulgaria follows. \"For the\r\nBulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people, Bulgarian-Soviet\r\nfriendship is like the sun and the air for every living creature, it is\r\na friendship of centuries and for centuries, one of the main driving\r\nforces of our development, a condition and guarantee for the future\r\nprogress of our socialist fatherland and its tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1971 assigns the conduct of foreign relations to the\r\nNational Assembly, the State Council, and the Council of Ministers.\r\nFormulation of foreign policy, however, remains a prerogative of the\r\nBKP. The constitution states that the National Assembly implements\r\nforeign policy but, because the assembly meets only three times each\r\nyear in short sessions, the implementation function is passed on to the\r\nState Council during the long interim periods between assembly meetings.\r\nPrimary responsibilities of the State Council in foreign affairs (as\r\nopposed to those limited to the periods between National Assembly\r\nmeetings) include representation of the country in its international\r\nrelations; the appointment, recall, or release from duty of diplomats\r\nand consular officials; the ratification or denunciation of\r\ninternational agreements; and the establishment of diplomatic and\r\nconsular ranks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ministries of foreign affairs and foreign trade are the\r\ngovernmental operating agencies in the field of international\r\nrelations, in theory and in fact the State Council is the supervisory\r\nbody. The State Council exercises control over the activities of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers and the ministries as stipulated in the\r\nconstitution. In essence, the State Council is the most powerful\r\ngovernment organ, not only in foreign affairs but in all governmental\r\nactivities. The interlocking of positions between the highest levels of\r\nthe party and the highest levels of the government assures that the BKP\r\nprogram will be implemented.\r\n\r\nAccording to the constitution, the Council of Ministers \"organizes the\r\nimplementation of the home and foreign policy of the state.\" The council\r\nis also charged with the concluding of international agreements and the\r\napproval or denunciation of international agreements that are not\r\nsubject to ratification. In performing its constitutional duties in\r\nforeign affairs, the Council of Ministers acts through the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the administrative arm of the\r\ngovernment in the execution of foreign policy directives, decrees, and\r\ndecisions of the BKP and in representing the country abroad in\r\nembassies, legations, and consular offices. The ministry, in the\r\nprosecution of its duties and functions, employs a minister, two first\r\ndeputy ministers, four deputy ministers, and a secretary general, who\r\nare assisted by the heads of eight geographic departments. In 1973 these\r\ndepartments were designated to handle affairs with the Soviet Union,\r\nother socialist states, the Balkans, Western Europe, Asia, the Arab-bloc\r\ncountries, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas.\r\n\r\nThe functional departments include: administrative, consular, political,\r\nresearch and planning, cultural, documentation and archives, economic,\r\nfinance and accounting, international organization, inspectors,\r\npersonnel, press and cultural affairs, protocol, and legal. A committee\r\nfor church affairs and a diplomatic service bureau, although not\r\nclassified as regular departments, function as such. Also included is\r\nthe position of disarmament negotiator.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Foreign Trade functions under the direction and\r\nsupervision of a minister, a first deputy minister, and six deputy\r\nministers, who are almost always high-ranking members of the BKP. The\r\nministry itself is organized into thirteen geographic offices and seven\r\ndepartments. The different geographic offices handle trade agreements\r\nwith the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, developed capitalist\r\ncountries, Asia and Latin America, and the Arab and African countries.\r\nOther offices include foreign exchange planning and accounting,\r\ncoordination, leadership and control of foreign trade organizations,\r\ncurrency and finance, economic planning, market conditions, planning,\r\nand personnel. There are departments for statistics, secretariat and\r\nprotocol, legal and departmental arbitration, accounting and auditing,\r\nadministration, labor and wages, and control inspectorate.\r\nAdditionally, there are offices and sections not falling under any\r\nspecific category but existing independently. They are: an office for a\r\ntrade fair director general, trade representatives, a foreign trade\r\nresearch institute, and a state inspection on the quality of goods for\r\nexport.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\nRelations with Communist Countries\r\n\r\nBulgaria's foreign policy and foreign trade are circumscribed to a great\r\nextent within the alliances formed by the Soviet Union and the communist\r\ncountries of Eastern Europe. In the early 1970s this tightly knit,\r\nalthough polycentric, group continued to expect and did receive\r\nBulgaria's participation in preserving the status quo in Eastern Europe.\r\nAs is the case with other Eastern European countries, Bulgaria wants\r\nWestern technology and also would like to attract more Western tourists\r\nto increase its hard currency intake. Bulgaria's motive for attracting\r\nthe West is economic rather than ideological. It is accepted within the\r\nsocialist alliances that the principle of proletarian internationalism\r\ndoes not preclude diversity of trading partners of the individual member\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoviet Union\r\n\r\nBulgarian relations with the Soviet Union have been described as\r\nsubservient, and Zhivkov once acknowledged that he was \"known for being\r\nbound to the Soviet Union in life and death.\" In 1948 Bulgaria entered\r\ninto the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid with the\r\nSoviet Union, which was renewed for another twenty years on May 12,\r\n1967, and over the years the close alignment between the two countries\r\nhas taken on greater importance. Ideologically, it is well known that\r\nBulgaria is a loyal partner within the Soviet-dominated socialist group.\r\nIts leaders have been schooled in Marxism-Leninism and usually look to\r\nthe Soviet Union for leadership.\r\n\r\nEconomically, Bulgaria still looks to the Soviet Union for foreign aid\r\nand preferential trade treatment. The rapid pace with which Bulgaria has\r\nmoved toward industrialization is primarily owing to Soviet assistance.\r\nRaw materials critical to Bulgaria's economy are supplied by the Soviet\r\nUnion and, with Soviet aid, the country has been able to construct many\r\nlarge industrial enterprises. Estimates in 1967 put the number of Soviet\r\nspecialists in Bulgaria at 5,000, and the number has probably increased.\r\nThe renewal of a five-year agreement for 1971 through 1975 would serve\r\nto increase further the Soviet share of trade in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations with Other Communist States\r\n\r\nBulgaria's relations with Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland,\r\nand Romania are largely governed by a series of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral treaties of friendship and cultural cooperation and by\r\nmilitary and economic alliances. The alliances are the Warsaw Pact and\r\nCOMECON. Relations with the other two communist states of Eastern\r\nEurope, Albania and Yugoslavia, have usually followed Soviet initiatives\r\ntoward those countries.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally, Bulgaria's major concerns in foreign affairs have dealt\r\nwith relations among the states of the Balkan Peninsula and particularly\r\nwith adjacent states. Romania, its northern neighbor, is a member of\r\nCOMECON and the Warsaw Pact but has often appeared to be a reluctant\r\nmember and since the early 1960s has stressed nationalism rather than\r\nMarxist internationalism, causing Bulgaria, with its strong Soviet\r\norientation, to tread lightly in bilateral relations for fear of\r\noffending the Soviets. Nevertheless, the Bulgarians and Romanians have\r\ndrawn closer together, probably because both countries see benefits that\r\nmight accrue from Balkan cooperation and believe that such cooperation\r\nshould in no way disturb the Soviet Union. In the early 1970s relations\r\nappeared to be particularly good: there were frequent meetings between\r\nleaders and government ministers, and a plan to cooperate in the\r\nbuilding of a huge hydroelectric project on the Danube River between the\r\ntwo countries was announced.\r\n\r\nRelations with Yugoslavia have more often than not been troubled to the\r\npoint of enmity. The problems existing between these two countries have\r\ndeep historical roots that hinge primarily on the Bulgarian contention\r\nthat Macedonia (since 1946 a federated republic of Yugoslavia) should be\r\nBulgarian rather than Yugoslavian. After World War II, when both\r\ncountries became communist, the Macedonian question was purposely\r\ndeemphasized but, when the Soviet-Yugoslav split occurred in 1948,\r\nideological differences paved the way for a renewal of the polemics on\r\nthe Bulgarian irredentist claims. In the early 1970s the polemics were\r\nreduced to a minor level, and constructive talks leading to a\r\nrapprochement began to occur. The changed atmosphere was attributed to\r\nthe state of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia but, for\r\nwhatever reason, the climate of relations between Bulgaria and its\r\nwestern neighbor was considerably improved, and Bulgarian irredentism\r\nwas submerged.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations with Noncommunist States\r\n\r\nThe European Conference for Security and Cooperation held in Helsinki in\r\nthe spring of 1973 discussed the possibility of a freer exchange of\r\npeople and ideas as well as a freer flow of information between Western\r\nEuropean and Eastern European societies. The intensity of ideological\r\npolemics had diminished with increasing contacts between East and West,\r\nand the gap between the two social systems seemed narrower, especially\r\nin regard to economic planning and development. Bulgaria, however,\r\npublicly expressed doubts about importing anti-communist theories that\r\nmight accompany the freer exchanges of people, ideas, and information.\r\n\r\nIn a plenum of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party\r\nin July 1973, the party leaders touched on issues of international\r\nrelations. The leaders pledged to continue a new policy of building\r\ngoodwill and enhancing relations with noncommunist European states as\r\nwell as with other developed capitalist states in all aspects of\r\npolitical, economic, cultural, and other relations. Bulgaria also sought\r\nto continue cultivating and developing friendly relations with\r\nnonaligned friendly countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\r\nConsistent with this policy, it pledged to render assistance to these\r\ncountries, especially where there were national liberation movements\r\ninvolved in active resistance to the established regimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreece and Turkey\r\n\r\nGreece is geographically contiguous to Bulgaria, and relations between\r\nthe two countries have been alternately hot and cold depending on the\r\npolitical climate of the times. In 1964 both countries signed an accord\r\nrelative to war reparations, which opened up some channels of\r\ncommunication, cultural exchanges, and relaxed travel restrictions. The\r\nmove toward better relations was interrupted by the 1967 coup d'etat in\r\nGreece, but improvement began again in the early 1970s when officials of\r\nthe two governments exchanged visits. By 1972 a newly created\r\nBulgarian-Greek economic cooperation commission had met in Sofia.\r\n\r\nDifficulties between Bulgaria and Turkey have deep roots in history and\r\nalso involve the 750,000 ethnic Turks still residing in Bulgaria (see\r\nch. 2; ch. 4). An atmosphere of cordiality, however, had been developing\r\nslowly as the officials of both countries cautiously negotiated to\r\nreduce tensions between the two countries. Exchanges of high-level\r\nvisits and the signing of various economic agreements had stabilized\r\nBulgarian-Turkish relations by the early 1970s. The hijacking of two\r\nTurkish planes to Sofia in 1972 disturbed the détente temporarily, but\r\nthe Bulgarian foreign minister went quickly to Turkey to make amends. In\r\n1973 the two countries again enjoyed improved relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States\r\n\r\nThe tensions that marked Bulgarian-United States foreign relations in\r\nthe 1950s eased somewhat in the 1960s. The legations of both countries\r\nwere raised to embassy status in November 1966. This action was believed\r\nto be an offshoot of United States efforts, particularly that of\r\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, to \"build bridges\" to Eastern Europe. This\r\nresumption of diplomatic goodwill was not pursued vigorously and, at the\r\ntime, reception to the idea in Bulgaria was generally cool. A noted\r\ncommunist theoretician regarded the United States overtures as a\r\ndivisive force in the fraternal world of the communist movement,\r\ndesigned ultimately to bring in a capitalist system inimical to the\r\nideological interest of any socialist country.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the relations between the two countries were, however, cordial.\r\nObservers noted an increase in trade, although it was still\r\nquantitatively small and accounted for only between US$6 million and\r\nUS$7 million annually. Bulgaria hoped to increase this volume to US$30\r\nmillion, especially by exporting high-quality tobacco to the United\r\nStates market.\r\n\r\nBulgaria has been seeking a consular agreement that would grant it\r\nmost-favored-nation tariff treatment in order to keep Bulgarian exports\r\non a competitive level with others in the United States market. Toward\r\nthis end, a Bulgarian trade delegation visited the United States in\r\nmid-July 1973 to exchange views on expanded trade and economic relations\r\nbetween the two countries. While in Washington the delegation met with\r\ntop officials from the Department of State, the Department of Commerce,\r\nthe Department of the Treasury, and the Export-Import Bank and with some\r\nmembers of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Germany\r\n\r\nThe two world wars saw Bulgaria fighting on Germany's side. Thereafter\r\nBulgarian policy differed from the Soviet line only once in a case that\r\ninvolved relations between Bulgaria and the Federal Republic of Germany\r\n(West Germany). When Chancellor Ludwig Erhard sounded out several\r\nEastern European governments with peace notes in 1966, Bulgaria along\r\nwith Romania did not publish official replies. Later that year West\r\nGerman officials met with the Bulgarian foreign minister, and it\r\nappeared that normalization of relations was in the offing. The\r\nnegotiations did not come to fruition, however, and Bulgaria fell back\r\nin line with the Soviet Union, which at the time was hostile to West\r\nGermany. The mere fact that Bulgaria participated in such independent\r\ntalks appeared remarkable to some observers.\r\n\r\nDuring 1972 relations between Bulgaria and West Germany improved. Some\r\nof the reasons attributed to this changing tack included the\r\nratification of treaties negotiated between West Germany, Poland, and\r\nthe Soviet Union; the opening of diplomatic channels between Poland and\r\nWest Germany; and the meetings of ambassadors of European countries in\r\nHelsinki. Most important, however, was the signing of a basic treaty\r\nthat established and regulated relations between West and East Germany,\r\na condition set by Bulgaria before diplomatic relations could be resumed\r\nwith West Germany. The open advocacy of the Soviet Union for improved\r\nrelations with West Germany also encouraged Bulgaria to expedite the\r\nresumption of diplomatic communications.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Western Countries\r\n\r\nThe mid-1960s saw party chief Zhivkov \"building bridges\" himself with\r\nother Western countries. In light of Bulgaria's interest in expansion of\r\ntrade, relations with France were improved with reciprocal visits in\r\n1966 between Zhivkov and Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville.\r\nAlso in the same year, partly as a result of these negotiations, the\r\nFrench car manufacturer, Renault, established an assembly plant in\r\nBulgaria. Simultaneous with this move was the establishment of a\r\ndiplomatic mission in Canada. Agreements were negotiated with Belgium\r\nand Italy on cultural, technical, and economic matters. Australia also\r\nhad a share of Bulgaria's trade attention; both countries signed a\r\nlong-term trade agreement in 1972, and an agreement was reached to\r\nestablish diplomatic relations at the embassy level.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations with Other States\r\n\r\nBulgarian interest in trade with the developing countries has increased\r\nconsiderably. In 1971 and 1972 the volume of trade with third world\r\ncountries exceeded 316 million leva (for value of the lev--see Glossary)\r\nas opposed to 113.3 million leva in 1965. The Arab countries rank first\r\nin the amount of business conducted with Bulgaria. A considerable number\r\nof Bulgarian experts are also engaged in the construction of industrial\r\nenterprises in various developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERSHIP IN REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nRegional Cooperation\r\n\r\nMilitary cooperation on a regional basis was secured for Bulgaria and\r\nits allies (the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania,\r\nand Czechoslovakia) in a multilateral alliance known as the Warsaw Pact.\r\nAlbania, an original member, withdrew in 1968 (see ch. 16). Signed on\r\nMay 14, 1955, in Warsaw, Poland, the pact was and remains Eastern\r\nEurope's answer to the challenges and security arrangements of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In one sense it seemed to provide\r\nlegal grounds for the Soviet Union to keep its troops in east-central\r\nEurope as well as to secure the balance of military power in Europe,\r\nespecially after West Germany joined NATO. In another sense it confirmed\r\nthe Soviet Union's political and military hegemony in all of Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe organization has two main bodies--the Political Consultative\r\nCommittee, which recommends general questions of foreign policy for\r\nmember countries, and the High Command of United Armed Forces, which\r\nprepares military plans in time of war and decides troop deployments.\r\nBoth bodies are located in Moscow, and all its senior ranking officials\r\nare Russians.\r\n\r\nBulgaria has bilateral treaties of mutual aid with each other member of\r\nthe Warsaw Pact. A multilateral agreement binds all the members to one\r\nanother in general and to the Soviet Union in particular. Within\r\nBulgaria Soviet officers serve as advisers at the division level and\r\nformerly served down to the regiment level. Others serve as instructors.\r\n\r\nBulgaria was a charter member of COMECON in 1949. An economic alliance\r\namong Eastern European countries, COMECON is the counterpart to Western\r\nEurope's European Economic Community (commonly called the Common\r\nMarket). Other members are the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,\r\nPoland, Romania, and East Germany. Mongolia and Cuba, non-European\r\ncountries, joined in June 1962 and July 1972, respectively. Albania\r\njoined in 1949 but withdrew in 1961.\r\n\r\nFounded as an outlet for agricultural and industrial products and as a\r\ncapital-and-labor market, COMECON, like the Warsaw Pact, binds its\r\nmembers to each other and all of them to the Soviet Union. Long-term\r\ntrade agreements of five years are usually renewable at the end of each\r\nterm. It is estimated that 60 to 65 percent of the total foreign trade\r\nof each signatory is carried on with other member countries. One of the\r\nobvious disadvantages of the organization, however, is the absence of a\r\ncommon market. Trade and commerce between the member countries are\r\ncarried out on the basis of preference and within the framework of\r\nbilateral agreements.\r\n\r\nBecause the loose structure of COMECON does not make for effective\r\nregional planning, member countries such as Bulgaria continue to renew\r\nbilateral trade agreements within COMECON. The Soviet Union remains\r\nBulgaria's largest foreign market, accounting for more than 50 percent\r\nof Bulgarian trade. Bulgaria also agreed to send Bulgarian workers to\r\nthe Soviet Union for heavy industrial projects.\r\n\r\nParticipation of Bulgaria on a regional level has been confined to a few\r\nprojects. Among these are a COMECON electric power grid, which serves\r\nthe western Ukraine, especially the city of Kiev; a Romanian-Bulgarian\r\nproject to construct a power dam and navigation system for sixty miles\r\nalong the Danube River; a system of high-speed expressways to connect\r\nthe capital cities of member countries; a project to modernize steel\r\nindustries and to reduce production and delivery time; and membership in\r\nthe International Bank for Economic Cooperation, headed by a former\r\ndeputy chairman of the Soviet State Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Membership and Participation\r\n\r\nBulgaria became a member of the UN on December 14, 1955. Its delegates\r\nare active in committee work of the UN organs and subsidiary bodies as\r\nwell as in deliberations on the floor of the General Assembly. One of\r\nits most important committee assignments is to the so-called First\r\nCommittee, which was established as one of the original six committees\r\nunder the General Assembly's rules of procedure in 1946. It deals with\r\npolitical and security matters and was headed by Milko Tarabanov, one of\r\nfive Bulgarian delegates to the UN in the session held from September\r\nthrough December 1972.\r\n\r\nAvailable records of General Assembly activities in 1970 showed active\r\nparticipation of Bulgaria's delegates in committee work touching on such\r\nmatters as the review of administrative tribunal judgments; the question\r\nof defining aggression; the peaceful uses of outer space; the peaceful\r\nuses of the seabed under international waters; and the implementation of\r\nthe declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries\r\nand peoples. Bulgaria was particularly interested in the Caribbean\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Committee on Disarmament, Bulgaria, along with\r\ntwenty-four other participating states, met in Geneva in 1970. The\r\ncommittee met to consider the question of cessation of the nuclear arms\r\nrace and associated matters, such as the prohibition of emplacing\r\nnuclear arms or other destructive weapons on the seabed. A refinement of\r\nthe comprehensive test ban treaty of 1963 extended the prohibition on\r\narms control to underground testing. Bulgaria, along with other Eastern\r\nEuropean countries, also supported draft proposals of the committee not\r\nto undertake the \"development, production, and stockpiling of chemical\r\nand bacteriological weapons\" and the consequent \"destruction of such\r\nweapons\" as well as the prohibition of \"biological methods of warfare.\"\r\nBulgaria, as a member of the General Assembly's First Committee, also\r\ncosponsored a resolution to secure guarantees that the seabed would be\r\nused only for peaceful means.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the question of nuclear and thermonuclear testing, Bulgaria\r\nsought the early passage of an agreement to prohibit all nuclear weapons\r\ntesting while the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were going on\r\nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. Bulgaria also\r\nparticipated actively in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer\r\nSpace. As a member of a subcommittee's working group, proposals and\r\nworking papers were submitted on the question of liability for damage\r\ncaused by objects that were launched into outer space. For its part,\r\nBulgaria sought to clarify the \"question of applicable law\" and the\r\n\"settlement of disputes.\"\r\n\r\nThe country was also represented in bodies dealing with economic\r\nquestions; questions of development; and social questions involving\r\nhousing, building, and planning as well as the promotion of children's\r\nwelfare. Additionally, the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment had Bulgarian delegates in five of its working groups,\r\ndealing with trade and development, commodities, domestic shipping,\r\ninternational shipping legislation, and the transfer of technology.\r\nBulgaria is also a member of the Economic Commission for Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nMASS COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Communists took over the government in 1944, the mass\r\ncommunications systems have been perceived as instruments of propaganda\r\nand vehicles for party control. Because of this perception of the\r\nsignificance of the media, the new government immediately claimed all\r\nmass media as state property.\r\n\r\nThere is little if any tolerance of the free expression of ideas\r\nthroughout the entire mass communications system. Because Bulgaria is\r\nmore closely tied to the Soviet Union than most of the other Eastern\r\nEuropean countries, the dictates of Moscow are virtually followed to the\r\nletter in the media. Themes that are initiated in Moscow are reiterated\r\nalmost verbatim in Sofia. The major theme of the mass media is respect\r\nfor and emulation of the Soviet Union, although recently some social\r\nthemes--such as the problems of youth and alcoholism--have been\r\nincorporated as well.\r\n\r\nThe only sources of information and entertainment permitted to the\r\npeople are the domestically controlled mass media. Most Bulgarians\r\ndistrust information available to them from these sources but, having no\r\nalternative, continue to use them.\r\n\r\nHistorically, of all the mass communications systems, the press has\r\nalways reached the largest number of people and has traditionally been\r\nviewed by the government as the most effective means of informing the\r\ngeneral public. Although the circulation of the press dropped\r\ndrastically in the mid-1940s, it has since the 1960s once again become\r\nthe chief instrument of the mass communications system. Radio has\r\ngreatly expanded in variety and scope since the 1940s. Television,\r\nalthough slow to develop and still limited in its audience relative to\r\nother European countries, has been growing rapidly since the early 1960s\r\nand was beginning to experiment with color in the early 1970s.\r\n\r\nThere has been little change in the Bulgarian publishing industry since\r\n1944. Owing to the government's fear of contamination by the West or\r\nother capitalist societies, there is very little importation of foreign\r\nbooks into the country. Although books have increased greatly in terms\r\nof sheer numbers of editions, the quantity of book titles has remained\r\nvery much the same since World War II.\r\n\r\nLibraries range from those under the control of state ministries and\r\ncommittees to local reading rooms and enterprise libraries. The latter\r\nare generally more widely used by the people.\r\n\r\nSince the end of World War II the film industry has grown to a great\r\nextent. Like other instruments of the media, films are chosen for their\r\npropagandistic value; however, since the advent of television, fewer\r\npeople have attended films.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe press--composed of newspapers and periodicals--was the most\r\ndeveloped of the Bulgarian media in the first half of the twentieth\r\ncentury. Radio, which was introduced in the 1920s, was under the aegis\r\nof what was then the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone. The\r\nproduction, importation, and sale of radios were unrestricted. The least\r\ndeveloped communications system of the day was the film industry, which\r\nwas privately owned and operated. Television was not initiated in the\r\ncountry until the mid-1950s.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately after the takeover, a strong pro-Soviet policy\r\nwas established for the media, which was still in effect in 1973. While\r\nthe new government restricted individual freedom and initiative within\r\nthe media, it demanded total support by the media of all policies of the\r\nSoviet Union. Despite the fact that Bulgaria has never deviated from the\r\npolicy of complete commitment to the Soviet Union, after the invasion of\r\nCzechoslovakia various media conferences were held in which calls for\r\nstricter adherence to the Soviet line were sounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF MASS COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe government has certain distinct perceptions as to how the media must\r\nserve the state. Propaganda permeates every aspect of life from formal\r\neducation to membership in unions and clubs to the publication of books\r\nand pamphlets. The Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary) is the\r\nmain political force. It both creates the appropriate condition for the\r\nexpression of public opinion and forms public opinion itself.\r\n\r\nAt a recent conference on the mass communications system, a leading\r\nmember of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party\r\ndelineated the principal tasks of the media. The major task of the media\r\nwas \"to work for the broadest possible propagation of the congress\r\ndecisions and for the mobilization of the people's physical and mental\r\npowers to make their decisions materialize....\" The second vital task of\r\nthe media was to \"help form a socialist outlook on life among the\r\npeoples and educate the new man--active fighter for the developed\r\nsocialist society, ideologically convinced, morally durable, physically\r\ntempered, with profound awareness of duty and responsibility.\" The third\r\ntask was to promote the economic awareness of the people and to train\r\nmanagers, specialists, workers, and farmers for the greater economic\r\ngood of the country. The fourth main task was to continue in the active\r\nstruggle against \"bourgeois ideology ... and the ideological subversion\r\nof imperialism.\"\r\n\r\nA basic tenet of the Bulgarian system, however, is the belief that mass\r\ncommunications must be actively supplemented by human contact on the\r\nindividual level. Iliya Georgiev, secretary of the Varna Okrug Bulgarian\r\nCommunist Party Committee, in an article on the political knowledge of\r\nworking people in 1972, stated categorically that the interest\r\nstimulated in the people by the mass communications system must be\r\nmaintained and extended by informal means of communications, such as\r\ndistrict (_okrug_) seminars, meetings in enterprises and farms,\r\nactivities in the trade unions, and the Dimitrov Communist Youth Union\r\n(Dimitrovski Komunisticheski Mladezhki Suyuz--commonly referred to as\r\nthe Komsomol).\r\n\r\nThe government has spent considerable time in assessing the extent to\r\nwhich these media objectives have been achieved. In the years\r\nimmediately following the takeover, the government was consistently\r\ndistressed by continued Bulgarian feelings of friendship with the West\r\nand the continual influence of the West upon the country. Although the\r\npropaganda efforts of the communist government were tireless, radio\r\nbroadcasts and printed materials from the West continued to pour into\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nAs the government's control over both the formal communications media\r\nand the informal means of communications widened, the external threat\r\nwas perceived to be less, and governmental attention turned to the\r\nassessment of the relative popularity of the various branches of the\r\nmedia. In a recent study 3,294 people were questioned as to their\r\nfavorite source of domestic and international information. The vast\r\nmajority--64.8 percent--of those polled stated that their preferred\r\nsource was daily newspapers; 24.6 percent preferred television; and only\r\n2.7 percent preferred radio. Although the newspapers were the favorite\r\nsource of information, they were frequently criticized by the people,\r\nwho expressed a basic lack of confidence in the press. In a second study\r\ndealing with people's attitudes toward the press alone, 48.1 percent of\r\nthe 900 people polled said they disliked the press, and 52.1 percent\r\ncomplained of the primitive quality of Bulgarian newspapers.\r\n\r\nYoung people, especially students, appeared to be even less stimulated\r\nby the mass media than their elders. A study performed in the 1969/70\r\nacademic year indicated that students were indifferent to both domestic\r\npolitical events and international developments. The pollsters concluded\r\nthat generally Bulgarian students take little advantage of the mass\r\nmedia as a source of information. Unlike the broad public, whose primary\r\nsource of information was the press, students tended to see television\r\nas their preferred source and the press and radio as secondary sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe 1947 Constitution, known as the Dimitrov Constitution, established\r\nthe stated rights of citizens as well as the nationalization of all\r\nprivate property, including the mass communications network. Regarding\r\nthe so-called freedom of citizens, Article 88 of the 1947 Constitution\r\nclaimed: \"The citizens of the People's Republic are guaranteed freedom\r\nof the press, of speech, of assembly, of meetings and demonstrations.\"\r\nAt the same time, Article 10 and Article 17 prohibited the unrestricted\r\nfreedom of private property and provided for its nationalization under\r\nthe authority of the National Assembly. More specifically, Article 80 of\r\nthe constitution dealt directly with the system of mass communications:\r\n\"The state cares for the development of science and art by establishing\r\n... publishing houses, libraries, theatres, museums, public reading\r\nclubs, ... film studios, [and] cinemas....\"\r\n\r\nIn 1956 the premier of the communist regime, Vulko Chervenkov,\r\nemphasized the ultimate control of the party over all institutions of\r\nthe country. He stated: \"No institution, organization, or person can be\r\nabove the Politburo and the Central Committee ... those guilty of\r\ndeviation from the Bolshevik rule must be held responsible and\r\npunished.\" Under his successor, Todor Zhivkov, a slight liberalization\r\nregarding freedom of the media ensued (see ch. 9). For a brief period\r\nwriters and scholars were given greater latitude of expression. When\r\nsome writers dared to openly criticize the government, however, Zhivkov\r\nwas unable to tolerate this criticism and reimposed restrictions on the\r\nmedia. The ultimate authority of the party was again made manifest. In\r\nan article in 1969, Georgi Bokov, chief editor of _Rabotnichesko Delo_\r\nand chairman of the Union of Bulgarian Journalists, flatly rejected the\r\nnotions of freedom and independence for the mass communications system.\r\nThe stated goals of the Union of Bulgarian Journalists in the late 1960s\r\nwere \"to promote the development of mass information and propaganda\r\nmedia as first-rate ideological weapons in the struggle for the victory\r\nof socialism and Communism ... the Union must constantly work to turn\r\nthe press, radio, and television into effective ideological instruments\r\nfor the Party.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1971, a new constitution was promulgated, but the basic clauses of\r\nthe 1947 document, regarding so-called individual freedoms and state\r\nownership, remained essentially intact. It was restated in Article 54\r\nthat \"citizens enjoy freedom of speech, press, meetings, associations\r\nand demonstrations.\" Article 46 again provided for state development of,\r\nand control over, the mass communications system.\r\n\r\nThe results of the policy regarding the media are witnessed by numerous\r\nexamples of party control and the repression of dissidents. All\r\nnewspapers must provide space for the official news of the government,\r\nand all Central Committee directives must be printed without alteration.\r\nNo dispatches sent out by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency (Bulgarska\r\nTelegrafna Agentsiya--BTA)--the official news agency of the\r\ncountry--are allowed to be revised. No criticism of government policies\r\nis tolerated. Dissident individuals and groups are singled out for\r\ncriticism by the Politburo. In 1972 a Politburo member, Todor Pavlov,\r\naccused certain writers of rejecting Socialist Realism in favor of more\r\nbourgeois literature and art. Other writers were criticized for their\r\nso-called subjectivistic interpretation of Bulgarian literature and were\r\nbranded as pseudoscientists.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF THE MASS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAdministrative Units\r\n\r\nAs the system has evolved, the broad outlines of propaganda have been\r\ndictated from the Politburo, the party's chief policymaking unit. From\r\nthere policy is transmitted to the Agitation and Propaganda Department\r\n(Agitprop), which is a major operational unit of the Central Committee.\r\nAgitprop, in turn, is responsible for the transmission of guidelines\r\ndown to the lowest levels of party organization. Simultaneously, the\r\nsame dictates are transmitted throughout all cultural institutions by\r\nthe Ministry of Information and Communications. Under this ministry's\r\njurisdiction are the arts, the film industry, radiobroadcasting,\r\ntelevision, book and pamphlet publishing, printing, all cultural or\r\neducational institutions, and all so-called independent artists. Still a\r\nthird channel for the transmission of the original propaganda are the\r\nmass organizations that function in the propaganda field under direction\r\nof either Agitprop or the Ministry of Information and Communications\r\n(see ch. 9).\r\n\r\nThe administrative center for all media is Sofia, the capital. Eight\r\ndaily newspapers are published in Sofia and distributed throughout the\r\ncountry; there are also seventeen major publishing houses in Sofia. The\r\nNational Film Board, which oversees all aspects of film production, is\r\nin Sofia, as is Radio Sofia, which is the radio station for the entire\r\ncountry. The Cyril and Methodius Library--also known as the Bulgarian\r\nNational Library--is within the confines of the city, as are the Union\r\nof Bulgarian Writers; the Union of Bulgarian Artists; and the Union of\r\nComposers, Musicologists, and Performing Musicians (see ch. 7).\r\n\r\nThe exportation of propaganda is under the auspices of the Sofia Press\r\nAgency. This agency was founded in 1967 with the express purpose of\r\ndisseminating Bulgarian propaganda to other countries. Its three major\r\ntasks are to publicize Bulgaria's achievements and successes actively to\r\nthe world; to attempt to counter anti-Bulgarian propaganda; and to\r\nprovide the various communist parties of the world with rationale in\r\ntheir struggles against capitalism.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 the Sofia Press Agency was in the process of negotiating\r\nagreements with the BTA and the Committee for Television and Radio.\r\nAgreements had already been established with book publishers,\r\nphotographic artists, and the film industry. In early 1972 over 500\r\npeople--the majority of whom were editors and translators--were working\r\nfor the Sofia Press Agency, and contracts had been signed with\r\napproximately 120 foreign countries. Nine magazines, translated into\r\neleven languages, had been published each year in 2.5 million copies. A\r\ndual language newspaper has been published each year in 500,000 copies,\r\nand 400 books had appeared in approximately 4 million copies. Some\r\n15,000 articles had been written, 30,000 photographs taken, and dozens\r\nof television motion pictures and documentaries had been filmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Agency\r\n\r\nThe BTA was founded originally in 1898 in Sofia. It is the official news\r\nagency of the country and the sole source of both foreign and domestic\r\nnews. It receives most of its foreign items from the Soviet Union news\r\nagency but also maintains exchange agreements with Reuters, Associated\r\nPress, and the Associated Foreign Press as well as a host of lesser\r\nknown foreign news agencies, although it tends to be more discriminating\r\nin terms of the items selected from these sources.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s the BTA had twenty-three correspondents posted throughout\r\nthe nation, as well as foreign correspondents in Moscow, Peking, East\r\nBerlin, Prague, Budapest, Tirana, Belgrade, Ankara, Paris, Bonn, New\r\nYork, Vienna, Cairo, and New Delhi. Correspondents are sent on special\r\nassignments to investigate news that is considered to be of interest to\r\nBulgaria. Domestic news is reproduced in Russian, English, French,\r\nGerman, and Spanish, and international news is reproduced in Russian,\r\nEnglish, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. In an average day the BTA\r\nreceives approximately 800 foreign newspapers, magazines, and bulletins\r\nand itself produces over 125,000 words.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEMES OF THE MEDIA\r\n\r\nThe predominant theme of the media remains the expression of friendship\r\nwith the Soviet Union. In 1971 a leading member of the party's Central\r\nCommittee informed members of the media that one of their primary\r\nfunctions was to champion the feelings of \"fraternal love, trust, and\r\ngratitude\" of the Bulgarian people for the \"heroic Soviet people,\" at\r\nthe same time demonstrating \"clearly and convincingly the unbreakable\r\nties linking our present and future with the present and future of the\r\nSoviet Union.\"\r\n\r\nA second common theme of the current media deals with the continuing\r\nstruggle between so-called bourgeois capitalism and socialism. The\r\npeople are, on the one hand, warned of the invidiousness of capitalistic\r\nmethods--\"The veiled methods of ideological struggle applied on an even\r\nbroader scale by contemporary imperialism requires greater vigilance\r\nfrom us....\" On the other hand they are assured that socialism will\r\nultimately prevail--\"their [socialist] ideas make their way with\r\ninsuperable force into the minds and hearts of working people all over\r\nthe world, gain more and more new adherents, and become a powerful\r\nfactor of social progress.\"\r\n\r\nAnother dichotomy that the media pose as a continuing theme is that of\r\nreligion versus socialism. Bulgarian writers triumphantly proclaim that\r\n\"religion as a component of the sociological structure of society for\r\nthousands of years gradually withers away at an even faster pace\r\nthroughout the transition from capitalism to communism.\" Since one of\r\nthe major aims of the government is to eliminate religious sentiment\r\namong the people, the public is from time to time assured\r\nthat--according to the latest survey--only 35.5 percent of the\r\npopulation is considered religious or that the \"Bulgarian people is one\r\nof the least religious in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnother divisive force that is frequently posed by the media is national\r\npatriotism versus proletarian internationalism. Although\r\ninternationalism is viewed as predominant, citizens are warned against\r\nfeelings of bourgeois nationalism, since the \"unity between\r\ninternationalism and patriotism is of a relative character, and there is\r\nalways the real possibility of dissension between them; they may even be\r\nplaced into a position of mutual opposition.\" Somehow the conflict,\r\naccording to the journal _Filosofska Misal_, is perceived as being\r\nresolved through a higher form of patriotism that is inextricably linked\r\nwith love of the Soviet Union. Socialist patriotism is seen as a\r\n\"qualitatively new, higher form of patriotism\" as expressed in \"love and\r\ngratitude toward the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet\r\nUnion organically linked with love for Bulgaria.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the media's constant expression of admiration for,\r\nand solidarity with, the Soviet Union, any issue that raises the\r\nquestion of conflicting loyalties between the People's Republic of China\r\n(PRC) and the Soviet Union is summarily dismissed with the reiteration\r\nof support for the Soviet Union. One journal warned the people of the\r\ndangers from the left in the form of the people of the PRC as well as\r\nfrom the right in the form of capitalist societies: \"Contrary to all\r\nhealthy logic, for years on end, the Chinese leadership has been waging\r\nhostile propaganda campaigns against the Soviet Union ... which are in\r\nno way inferior to the most malicious fabrications of bourgeois\r\nanti-Sovietism.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the troops of the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in August\r\n1968, Bulgaria once again rose to the Soviet Union's defense in complete\r\njustification of the invasion. The BTA cited a long list of workers,\r\npeasants, and intellectuals who were allegedly in favor of the action.\r\nMajor newspapers such as _Rabotnichesko Delo_ interpreted the event as\r\nsymbolic of proletarian internationalism, and _Zemedelsko Zname_ stated\r\nthat \"it is our supreme duty to resist the common enemy and not to allow\r\nanyone ever to tear away even one link from the chain of the socialist\r\ncommunity.\" The Czechoslovak uprising itself, as reported by the\r\nBulgarian press some months later, was interpreted as nationalistic and\r\ncounterrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nBulgaria's relationship with the West, as expressed by the media, has\r\nevolved over time from overt hostility to some degree of tolerance. In\r\n1968 the Bulgarian media openly denounced the concept of peaceful\r\ncoexistence with the West. By the early 1970s, however, although\r\ncitizens were still urged by the media to struggle against bourgeois\r\ncapitalism as epitomized by the West, a slight thaw in the cool\r\nrelations that had prevailed since the mid-1940s was detected. On the\r\none hand, all instruments of the media were urged to direct the people\r\naway from foreign influences and to struggle against \"bourgeois\r\nideology, anticommunism, and the ideological subversion of imperialism.\"\r\nOn the other hand, however, Western correspondents in 1973 declared that\r\nBulgaria was entering a period of greater flexibility with the West.\r\n\r\nThe last polemical theme of the Bulgarian mass media is known as the\r\nBulgarian miracle. Although success for the alleged achievement of\r\nBulgaria's national goals is attributed to correct socialism, the\r\napplication of Leninist principles, and the unity of party and people,\r\nthe media take every opportunity to stress the achievements of the\r\nBulgarian state since the advent of communism. One journal stated that\r\n\"our country strengthened and matured as a state with a modern socialist\r\nindustry, intensive mechanized agriculture, and flourishing national\r\nculture, a state enjoying an indisputable international prestige,\r\nrespected as an economic partner and as a factor for the safeguard of\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nOn the nonpolemical side, the Bulgarian media discuss both Bulgaria's\r\nimmediate social problems and issues that affect the world. The issue of\r\nalcoholism is discussed relatively openly and is viewed as an issue of\r\nnational concern. Alcoholism is perceived to be related to both the\r\nrising number of divorces and the frequency of crimes (see ch. 5; ch.\r\n15).\r\n\r\nBulgarians also have become involved in the international issue of\r\npollution of the environment, and the press has given the topic a fair\r\namount of coverage. The issue has been dealt with on a completely\r\nnonpolemical basis; in fact the brotherhood of all forms of societies is\r\nstressed as the means of combating the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS\r\n\r\nNewspapers\r\n\r\nIn 1944, three months after the new government took control, all\r\nnewspaper plants were made the property of the state. In the ensuing\r\nyear, the government took over the distribution of newsprint, and many\r\nnoncommunist editors and Communists were either jailed or executed. By\r\n1945 only eight daily and weekly newspapers were permitted to publish.\r\nFive of them were published under the aegis of a governmental or party\r\nagency. _Rabotnichesko Delo_--which was patterned on the Soviet\r\n_Pravda_--became the organ of the Central Committee, and _Otechestven\r\nFront_--patterned on the Soviet _Isvestia_--became the official organ of\r\nthe government. _Izgrev_ was an organ of the Fatherland Front _Zvenos_;\r\n_Narod_ was an instrument of the Fatherland Front (Otechestven Front)\r\nSocialists; and _Narodna Voiska_ was an army organ. _Politika_ was not\r\ndirectly affiliated with the party but was decidedly pro-Communist (see\r\nch. 9).\r\n\r\nThe other two newspapers, both expressing a degree of opposition, were\r\ntolerated only through 1946. These were _Narodno Zemedelsko Zname_, an\r\norgan of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union (Bulgarski Zemedelski Suyuz--BZS)\r\nand _Svoboden Narod_, an organ of the Social Democratic Party. In early\r\n1947, however, they were closed down.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Party Congress in 1948, endeavoring to more fully exploit the\r\npotential of the press for propaganda purposes, called upon it to serve\r\nas the \"first assistant of the Bulgarian Communist Party, of the\r\nFatherland Front, and of the government.\" The primary function of the\r\nprinted news media, as stated by that congress, was to mobilize the\r\nworking people in terms of their identification with the so-called great\r\nsocialist buildup. In the same year the Central Home of Bulgarian\r\nJournalists was established in order to train writers in the correct\r\npropaganda line established by the party. This institution was replaced\r\nin 1955 by the Union of Bulgarian Journalists.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II the national newspapers were generally four pages\r\nlong and consisted of news concerning Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and\r\nother socialist countries; progress reports regarding national economic\r\nplans; foreign news presented with a decided anti-Western bias; and\r\ninformation regarding cultural events and sports. Cartoons, which\r\nappeared occasionally in the daily and weekly newspapers, were generally\r\npropagandistic and dealt with so-called foreign agents, the bourgeoise,\r\nand other so-called enemies of the people. There was little humor in the\r\nnewspapers, as their overall purpose was to portray and defend the\r\ncommunist system.\r\n\r\nThe national newspapers were modeled after those of the Soviet Union, in\r\nboth style and content. During the 1940s they established ties with the\r\nSoviet news agency, the Chinese Communist news agency, and the news\r\nagencies in other communist countries. All international events--those\r\ndealing with the communist-bloc countries and those dealing with the\r\nWest--were integrated through these sources.\r\n\r\nWhile Stalin lived, all of his dictates were followed to the letter,\r\nincluding the duplication of the Soviet example in the strong verbal\r\ncampaign against Yugoslavia. When Nikita Khrushchev succeeded him and\r\nsubsequently made some semblance of peace with Yugoslavia, the Bulgarian\r\npress followed suit. Similarly, when the Soviets quickly quelled the\r\nPolish and Hungarian revolts, the Bulgarian press endorsed the Soviet\r\nversions of these events. Strict control over the press was retained in\r\nthe early 1970s, and most news still emanated from the Soviet news\r\nagency. Censorship was seldom required, however, since all editors were\r\nby this time acutely aware of their responsibilities to the party.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the natural press, the provincial press concentrated on\r\nlocal matters. It included, in addition to a few regularly published\r\nnewspapers, a variety of new types of publications, such as\r\nmulticirculators--which were wall posters--and the so-called bumblebees,\r\nwhich were letters of accusation pointing out alleged failures of\r\nparticular individuals to maintain acceptable social standards or to\r\nattain programmed economic goals. In broad terms, all these publications\r\nwere designed to indoctrinate specific groups of people, generally in\r\ntheir places of work. The multicirculators called on workers to support\r\nthe economic goals of the government and promised them rewards if they\r\nfulfilled the required objectives (see table 10).\r\n\r\n_Table 10.

National daily newspapers\r\nordinarily had four pages, but sometimes had from six to eight pages\r\nwhen there was vital news to cover. Headlines were often printed in red,\r\nbut stories and articles were in black print. Since the late 1960s or\r\nearly 1970s advertising increased, and newspapers began to resemble\r\ntheir Western counterparts to a greater extent.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 thirteen daily newspapers were published, eight of which were\r\nprinted in Sofia. _Rabotnichesko Delo_ was a descendant of the first\r\nworkers' newspaper, which was begun in 1897. It led both in importance\r\nand circulation, was the primary organ of the BKP, and set the tone for\r\nall other newspapers in the country. In 1950 it had a daily circulation\r\nof 364,500 copies, and by 1960 its circulation had risen to 567,360. In\r\n1972 this newspaper had a total circulation of approximately 650,000\r\ncopies. The second most important daily newspaper published in Sofia\r\nwas the _Otechestven Front_, the organ of the government. This\r\npublication was initiated as an underground newspaper in 1942. As of\r\n1972 it claimed a daily circulation of 247,000.\r\n\r\nThe other Sofia dailies and their circulations were: _Zemedelsko Zname_,\r\n168,000; _Narodna Mladez_, the newspaper for youth, 225,000; _Trud_, the\r\norgan of the trade unions, 200,000; _Narodna Armiya_, an organ of the\r\nMinistry of National Defense, 50,000; _Vecherni Novini_, founded in\r\n1951, an evening newspaper, 40,000; and _Kooperativno Selo_, the organ\r\nof the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry, 230,000. The major\r\nprovincial dailies were _Otechestven Glas_ (in Plovdiv), _Narodno Delo_\r\n(in Varna), _Chernomorski Front_ (in Burgas), _Dunavska Pravda_ (in\r\nRuse), and _Pirinsklo Delo_ (in Blagoevgrad) (see table 11).\r\n\r\n_Table 11.

Periodicals were\r\nan extremely popular form of reading material.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading periodicals of Bulgaria are: _Novo Vreme_, a monthly\r\njournal of the Central Committee; _Ikonomicheska Misal_, the organ of\r\nthe Institute of Economics of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; _Puls_,\r\na publication of the Central Committee of the Komsomol; _Slavyani_, the\r\nmonthly journal of the Slav Committee in Bulgaria; _Bulgarski Voin_, the\r\nmonthly journal of the chief political department of the Bulgarian\r\nPeople's Army (Bulgarska Narodna Armiya); _Resorts_, a bimonthly journal\r\nprinted in Russian, French, English, and German; and _Lov i Ribolov_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIO\r\n\r\nIn 1939 there were three radio stations and over 60,000 subscribers (see\r\ntable 12). Approximately one out of every 100 Bulgarian citizens owned a\r\nradio set.\r\n\r\n_Table 12.

The ownership\r\nand operation of radios were subject to the chief directorate of radio\r\ninformation according to the Law on Radio. Article 15 of this law stated\r\nthat private homes could only receive programs of Bulgarian radio\r\nstations. Article 17 of the same law stated that all people wishing to\r\npurchase radios had to receive prior authorization and pay a radio tax.\r\n\r\nThe ideological purposes of radio broadcasts are presented by the\r\ngovernment in quasi-cold war terms. One radio commentator, Lyuben Popov,\r\nhas described the radio as a weapon for waging war on the air. He\r\nexplained that \"the struggle on the air is becoming sharper and sharper\r\nand more and more uncompromising.... Our propaganda work is part of the\r\nideological struggle for victory of communist ideas.\" Radio is perceived\r\nas serving two principal ends. On the domestic level it serves to\r\nprovide information as well as propaganda to the public; on the\r\ninternational level it functions in a purely ideological capacity.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve mediumwave radio transmitters: two are located in\r\nPleven; two in Kurdzhali; two in Sofia; and one each in Plovdiv,\r\nBlagoevgrad, Varna, Shumen, Stara Zagora, and Stolnik. There are eleven\r\nultra-shortwave stations: three are located in Sofia, two in Botev, two\r\nin Slunchev Bryag, two in Kyustendil, one in Snezhinka, and one in\r\nPlovdiv. There are four shortwave radio stations in Bulgaria. Of the\r\ntotal number of twenty-seven radio stations in the country, six\r\nbroadcast in both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation\r\n(FM); twenty broadcast in AM only; and one located at Botev Peak\r\nbroadcasts only in FM.\r\n\r\nBulgarian radio stations are on the air approximately 500 hours per\r\nweek. Foreign broadcasts are transmitted approximately twenty-six hours\r\na day Monday through Saturday and twenty-nine hours on Sunday. These\r\nprograms are broadcast in Bulgarian, Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croat,\r\nFrench, Italian, German, English, Spanish, and Arabic and are\r\ntransmitted to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, and South\r\nAmerica. The number of domestic listeners has approximately doubled over\r\nthe 1960-71 period. In mid-1973 over a quarter of the population owned\r\nradio sets.\r\n\r\nThe leading radio programs are transmitted by Radio Sofia. Radio\r\nPlovdiv, Radio Varna, and Radio Stara Zagora also transmit popular\r\nprograms. Radio Rodina is the main station transmitting to Bulgarians\r\nresiding abroad. Generally, radio programs consist of news bulletins\r\ndealing with both local and international events; programs for rural\r\nlisteners and industrial workers, which deal with industrial,\r\nagricultural, and cultural matters; programs for children, which\r\ncomplement the formal educational curriculum; literary and cultural\r\nprograms; and scientific programs.\r\n\r\nIn January 1971 Radio Sofia took steps to refurbish its old programming.\r\nSome critics felt that the old programming was lacking in variety,\r\ncausing listeners to turn to foreign broadcasts for more enjoyable\r\nentertainment. Others within the medium wanted to have more freedom and\r\ncreativity in programming. As a result, in mid-1973 the three main\r\nprograms of Radio Sofia had a singular and distinctive character.\r\n\"Horizont\" provided both general information and popular music. \"Christo\r\nBotev\" had a more cultural and propagandistic nature, presenting\r\nideological, literary, and educational programs. \"Orfei\" was the program\r\nfor classical music, which was occasionally supplemented by theatrical\r\nand literary features. The results of these changes have been mixed.\r\nAlthough some critics felt that the new programs were more lively than\r\ntheir predecessors, others continued to criticize them for a \"dearth of\r\noriginal thought, a laconic style, and a pompous tone.\"\r\n\r\nOther recent developments in radio have been the establishment of radio\r\nrelay ties with nearby countries. These relay ties are expected to\r\nincrease Bulgaria's communications with the West while providing her new\r\npartners with access to the East. In July 1972 the construction of radio\r\nlines between Bulgaria and Turkey was completed. In December 1972 plans\r\nfor a radio relay line between Sofia and Athens were announced; the line\r\nwas to be completed by 1974. This particular line was expected to\r\nprovide Greece with access to Eastern Europe and Bulgaria with access to\r\nthe Middle East and North Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEVISION\r\n\r\nTelevision, like radio, became a state monopoly under the control of the\r\nMinistry of Culture on March 26, 1948, but the first strictly\r\nexperimental broadcasts were not undertaken until 1954. It was 1959\r\nbefore the first regular programming--consisting of two programs per\r\nweek--was being broadcast. By 1962 programs had been increased to only\r\nfour per week.\r\n\r\nThe number of television subscribers rose from a mere 2,573 in 1960 to\r\n185,246 in 1965 and to 1.2 million in 1971. These figures meant the\r\nnumber of sets per 1,000 people were; less than one, in 1960; about\r\ntwenty-three, in 1965; and 138, in 1971. During the same period an\r\nincreasing number of transmitting stations was making reception possible\r\nin nearly all parts of the country. By 1972 there were twenty-seven\r\ntransmitters; the major ones were located at Sofia, Slunchev Bryag,\r\nBotev, Varna, and Kyustendil. In spite of the expansion of the network\r\nand the increasing numbers of sets available, in comparison to other\r\nEuropean countries there were still relatively few television\r\nsubscribers per 1,000 of the population.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of the television sets are located in the cities.\r\nAlthough there is only one major television program, Program I, plans\r\nare underway for the transmission of a second program, Program II. This,\r\nwhen added to the coverage of Program I, is expected to reach 95 percent\r\nof the population by 1975.\r\n\r\nTelevision is transmitted on a daily basis. The weekly programs run\r\nbetween 68 and 72 hours. Television time has been apportioned more or\r\nless according to popular taste. Of the total hours, 22 percent of\r\ntelevision time was devoted to documentaries, 15 percent to music, 12\r\npercent to news, 11 percent to programs for children, 10 percent to\r\nlanguage and literature programs, and 8 percent to sports. There were\r\nalso special broadcasts to villages and question-and-answer programs in\r\nindustrial enterprises and cooperative farms. Unlike the rest of Eastern\r\nEurope, Bulgaria imported very few television films from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent innovations in television programming was the\r\ntransmission of a special program for tourists in 1973. Bulgarian Radio\r\nand Television decided to cooperate with the Committee for Tourism to\r\npromote a 1-½-hour program for foreign tourists on the Black Sea coast.\r\nThe program, as envisioned in 1973, would consist of local news,\r\npresented on three different channels in Russian, English, and German\r\nrespectively; local events; international news; tourist information; and\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for Bulgarian television were outlined in the Sixth Five\r\nYear Plan (1971-75). Although color television programs in the 1970s\r\nwere transmitted to Bulgaria from Moscow, Bulgaria's own color\r\ntelevision was to be transmitted in late 1973. Along these lines,\r\nBulgaria planned to collaborate with Intervision--the Eastern European\r\ntelevision network--in the promotion of color television. In 1972 plans\r\nwere also being formulated for the construction of between 250 and 300\r\nrelay stations and additional television transmitters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHING\r\n\r\nIn 1939 there were 2,169 books and pamphlets published in 6.5 million\r\ncopies, and in 1948 there were 2,322 books and pamphlets published in\r\n19.9 million copies. By 1960 the number of book and pamphlet titles had\r\nrisen to 3,369 in 30.2 million copies, and by 1971 the number of book\r\nand pamphlet titles reached 4,188 in 46.8 million copies.\r\n\r\nMore recent studies of book and pamphlet publication conducted in 1969\r\nand 1970 indicated that the overwhelming majority of books and pamphlets\r\nwere written by Bulgarians. Of the 3,799 books published in 1970, there\r\nwere 3,368 by Bulgarian authors. The foreign works during this year were\r\npredominantly in Russian, 131; French, sixty-five; English, sixty-five;\r\nand German, fifty-four. There were few books translated from Spanish and\r\na sprinkling of translations from other lesser known languages. Of the\r\ntranslated works most were literary, followed by works dealing with the\r\nsocial sciences, the applied sciences, the arts, geography and history,\r\nthe so-called hard sciences, philosophy, philology, and religion.\r\n\r\nA 1971 study illustrates the fact that--in terms of titles alone--books\r\nare more popular than pamphlets by a ratio of approximately three to one\r\n(see table 13). The greatest number of book titles in 1971 were in the\r\nareas of artistic and folkloric literature, technology and industry, and\r\nscientific and educational texts. The smallest number of book titles\r\nwere in the areas of general handbooks, community affairs, and atheism\r\nand religion. The greatest number of pamphlet titles, on the other hand,\r\nwere in juvenile literature, communist party literature, and science and\r\neducation. The fewest pamphlet titles dealt with atheism and religion,\r\nMarxism-Leninism, languages, and labor and trade unions.\r\n\r\nBecause the Bulgarian publishing industry has emphasized the quantity of\r\nbooks available in terms of copies rather than variety or number of\r\ntitles, there has been some serious criticism of policy, particularly\r\nfrom the newspapers. In fact, among the Balkan countries, Bulgaria ranks\r\nbelow Yugoslavia, Romania, and Turkey in the number of titles published\r\nannually. One newspaper claimed that of the total number of books\r\npublished in 1972, only approximately one-third were so-called real\r\nbooks, meaning that they were not simply textbooks or brochures. This\r\nnewspaper claimed that foreign literature was not well known in Bulgaria\r\nand pointed out that the literature of Asia, Africa, and South America\r\nhad increased by only 470 titles since 1939.\r\n\r\nThe state not only is in charge of the publishing houses themselves but\r\nalso supervises the distribution of books throughout the country.\r\nEditorial councils are the final authorities in determining the output\r\nof individual publishing houses. The one exception to the general\r\nadministration of publishing houses is the publication of textbooks. In\r\nthis case the Committee on Art and Culture is responsible for the\r\nprinting of textbooks, and the Ministry of National Education is, in\r\nturn, responsible for their distribution.\r\n\r\n_Table 13.

All party control, however, is theoretically unofficial;\r\ncensorship exists only in the sense that all power of decision regarding\r\npublication is in the hands of party members. The official process for\r\npublication is that the writer submits his work to the publishing house.\r\nThe publishing house then sends it, with a brief description of its\r\nideological content, to the Committee on Art and Culture. If the book is\r\napproved at this stage, it is returned to the publishing house, where it\r\nis again checked for its ideological content.\r\n\r\nThe major criterion for acceptance is the ideological soundness of the\r\nwork in question. According to a refugee playwright from Bulgaria, \"The\r\njournalist must praise the party, and government, and criticize the\r\nWest. The poet, the playwright, the novelist must uphold the communist\r\nideal.\" Since the works of leading Communists are almost always accepted\r\nfor publication, one writer has stated; \"In Bulgaria dead communist\r\nheroes are the safest bet.\"\r\n\r\nThe government is actively engaged in attempting to promote Bulgarian\r\nbooks abroad. In the late 1960s and early 1970s books by native\r\nauthors--although in relatively small numbers--were published in such\r\ndiverse countries as Great Britain, Japan, France, Turkey, Italy, Iran,\r\nAustria, Argentina, and Finland. According to the latest available\r\nsource on the promotion of Bulgarian books abroad, plans also have been\r\nformulated for the publication of books in the United States, Belgium,\r\nBrazil, and Syria.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious problems in the publishing industry, other than\r\nthe broad issue of freedom of expression of the writers, is that of a\r\nshortage of textbooks. In 1970 the Committee for State Control\r\ndiscovered that courses in 1,013 subjects at the university level had no\r\ntextbooks whatsoever. In the University of Sofia alone, where\r\napproximately 317 subjects were taught, textbooks existed for only 216\r\nof these subjects; roughly half of the books for the 216 subjects that\r\nused textbooks were out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists took power in 1944, they began to allocate\r\nrelatively large sums of money to develop new libraries in both large\r\ncities and small villages. By 1971 the country had over 10,000\r\nlibraries, whose collections numbered nearly 50 million volumes (see\r\ntable 14).\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Art and Culture maintained a number of libraries,\r\nincluding the country's largest, the Bulgarian National Library. Founded\r\nin 1878 in Sofia, it contained 814,000 works in 1971, including about\r\n13,000 old and rare volumes, approximately 17,000 graphic works, and\r\nsome 20,000 photographs and portraits. The library published both a\r\nyearbook and a monthly periodical.\r\n\r\nThe committee maintained two other libraries. One was the Ivan Vazov\r\nState Library, situated in Plovdiv, whose collection included a wide\r\nvariety of periodicals, old and rare books, and archives. The other\r\nlibrary under the committee was the Elin Pelin Bulgarian Bibliographical\r\nInstitute, which maintained a record of all printed works in the country\r\nand published a monthly bulletin listing all of its publications, an\r\nannual yearbook, and a monthly list of all articles published in reviews\r\nand journals.\r\n\r\nIn addition there were research-related libraries maintained by the\r\nAcademy of Sciences; public school libraries; university libraries;\r\nlibraries organized in state plants, factories, and cooperative farms;\r\nregional libraries; and local libraries.\r\n\r\nThe major regional libraries were located in Burgas, Ruse, Stara Zagora,\r\nShumen, Varna, Velsko, and Turnovo. The best known local library was the\r\nCity Library of Sofia, which contained about 452,862 volumes.\r\n\r\n_Table 14.

Founded\r\nby educated Bulgarians during the Turkish occupation as centers of\r\nculture and education, the reading rooms have become quite widespread,\r\nparticularly in the villages, and supply books to farmworkers and other\r\nmembers of the rural population. In the early 1970s there were 4,108\r\nreading rooms with over 20 million volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILMS\r\n\r\nBy 1947, after the new constitution had been enacted, the film industry\r\nbecame a state monopoly. The next year the new Law on Motion Pictures\r\nwas passed, which essentially expanded on the theme of state control. It\r\nofficially abolished free enterprise in the film industry and prohibited\r\nindividual activities in the importation and exportation of films and\r\nthe private operation of movie theaters. The film industry fell under\r\nthe official control of the Bulgarian Cinematography Association, which\r\nwas under the Department of Motion Pictures of the Committee for\r\nScience, Art, and Culture. By 1950 the entire film industry was under\r\nthe complete control of the Council of Ministers. The Department of\r\nMotion Pictures became officially attached to the council.\r\n\r\nOne of the early laws regarding films stated that \"the motion picture\r\nmust become a real fighting assistant of the party and the government\r\nand be an ardent agitator and propagator of the government policy.\" The\r\nfocus of the industry was to be placed on the building of socialism\r\nwhile increasing the country's bonds with the Soviet Union. Early\r\nlegislation stated that \"Soviet films gave immense educational influence\r\nand mobilized action and conscious participation in the building of\r\nsocialism for still greater friendship with the Soviet Union.\" This\r\nemphasis on the relationship with the Soviet Union was not only\r\nideological. Soviet films also represented approximately 87 percent of\r\nthe films shown in Bulgaria from 1945 to 1956, and the Bulgarian film\r\nindustry was in large part assisted by its film counterpart in the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe film industry expanded quickly under the new government. There were\r\n187 films produced in 1960 (see table 15). By 1965 there were\r\napproximately 2,000 motion picture houses, roughly 83 percent of which\r\nwere in the villages.\r\n\r\n_Table 15.

In mid-1973 data suggested that between 100 and\r\n150 feature films were imported per year. These films generally came\r\nfrom the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, although a\r\nfew were imported from Italy, France, and Great Britain. The first\r\nBulgarian film to be exported was _The Chain_, which was shown in\r\nCzechoslovakia in 1964. The same year another Bulgarian film, _The\r\nIntransigents_, was shown in Ireland, and still another, _The Peach\r\nThief_, was shown in Great Britain. The precise number of Bulgarian\r\nfilms exported was unknown, although one writer claimed that in 1973\r\nBulgarian films were viewed in about seventy countries.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1973 the subject matter of Bulgarian films was characteristically\r\ncontemporary, and there was little focus on historical events. Although\r\na few historical films had been produced, they were in the minority. A\r\nfew films had dealt with the subject of Bulgarian resistance to the\r\nNazis, but they too were relatively scarce. More films were devoted to\r\nthe so-called people's heroic struggles. Most films in Bulgaria,\r\nhowever, dealt with contemporary life in the country and current events.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of these films treated the conflicts and\r\nissues of Bulgarian youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III. ECONOMIC\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder comprehensive control of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see\r\nGlossary), the economy was severely strained in mid-1973 as the result\r\nof the dual task imposed upon it by the BKP leadership to increase\r\nproductivity rapidly and substantially and to provide a growing volume\r\nof consumer goods and services under a newly announced program for\r\nraising the population's low standard of living. A first step in\r\nimproving the living standard took the form of an upward adjustment in\r\nthe lowest wage brackets and a broadening of social security provisions.\r\nFurther improvements, however, were made conditional upon attainment of\r\nthe productivity and production goals.\r\n\r\nThe development of the economy and of the consumer program faced severe\r\nlimitations because of the inadequacy of domestic resources, including\r\nbasic raw materials, fuels and power, skilled workers, and trained\r\nprofessional personnel. Economic development was heavily dependent on\r\nfinancial and technical aid from the Soviet Union, and dependence upon\r\nthat country was to be increased in the 1971-75 period. Efforts to\r\novercome persistent and growth-retarding difficulties in the economy led\r\nto frequent organizational and procedural changes in the economic\r\nmechanism, the structure of which in mid-1973 was still in flux as a\r\nresult of decisions taken by the BKP in 1965 and in 1968.\r\n\r\nThe main trend in reshaping the organization and management of the\r\neconomy was one of concentration and centralization--a trend that led to\r\nthe creation of huge trusts in industry and distribution and of vast\r\nagroindustrial complexes in agriculture. In the process, divisions and\r\nlines of authority were blurred, and violations of government directives\r\nwere frequent because of their complexity and the constraints they\r\nplaced on the day-to-day operation of economic enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn the search for a more efficient organization and management pattern,\r\nheavy reliance was placed on the introduction of complex automation into\r\nall economic processes with the aid of a nationwide computer network--a\r\nsystem of automation that would extend from the highest levels of\r\nnational economic planning down to the individual factory shop and cow\r\nbarn. No ideas have been advanced, however, on how complex automation\r\nwould solve the basic problem of the economy--the widely acknowledged\r\nand pervasive lack of incentives to work. The methods used to grapple\r\nwith this problem were limited to a tinkering with the wage and bonus\r\nsystem, administrative sanctions, political indoctrination, and\r\nexhortations.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nState ownership of the means of production predominates in the economy.\r\nCollective ownership has prevailed in agriculture, but it may be\r\ngradually eliminated in the course of the agricultural reorganization\r\ninitiated in 1970 (see ch. 13). Private ownership of productive\r\nresources is limited to subsidiary farm or garden enterprises of\r\ncollective farmers, industrial and state farmworkers, and artisans; a\r\nsmall number of individual farms on marginal lands; and noncollectivized\r\nartisan shops. In 1971 private ownership encompassed about 10 percent of\r\nthe agricultural land but only 2.5 percent of the fixed assets used in\r\nproduction. Private ownership of personal property and homes is allowed.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of national income (net material product) generated in\r\neach of the ownership sectors in 1971 were: state, 70 percent;\r\ncollective, 21 percent; and private, 9 percent. The importance of\r\nprivate enterprise in the production of food, however, is much greater\r\nthan its contribution to the national income may suggest. The private\r\nsector has provided more than one-fifth of the crop output and one-third\r\nof the livestock production (see ch. 13).\r\n\r\nWhereas the leadership has promoted livestock production on private farm\r\nplots, since 1968 it has placed increasingly severe restrictions on the\r\nactivities of private artisans, who had originally been encouraged to\r\nexpand their operations through liberal regulations issued in 1965.\r\nAside from providing essential services, private artisans played an\r\nimportant role in supplying a variety of consumer goods for the\r\npopulation. The restrictions on artisans' activities have been based on\r\nthe BKP tenet that private ownership of means of production and the use\r\nof personal property to acquire unearned income are incompatible with\r\nthe socialist order and the country's new constitution.\r\n\r\nEconomic activities are centrally planned and directed along lines\r\nprescribed by the BKP. The functions of planning and control are\r\nexercised by the Council of Ministers with the aid of specialized\r\neconomic ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of\r\nChemical Industry and Power Generation, and the Ministry of Foreign\r\nTrade, and of various governmental committees and commissions (see ch.\r\n8). The state banking system and, more particularly, bank credit have\r\nalso served as tools for the control of enterprises and trusts.\r\n\r\nThe economic management structure has been subject to frequent changes.\r\nIn the spring of 1972 there were fourteen economic ministries, including\r\nfive ministries exclusively concerned with branches of industry and\r\nconstruction. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Industry, as its\r\nname implies, has functioned in two major economic sectors and has also\r\nhad substantial responsibilities in the field of distribution. Among the\r\ncommittees and commissions the most important have been the State\r\nPlanning Committee, the Committee on Prices, and the Commission for\r\nEconomic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation. In December 1972 the\r\nCommission on the Living Standard was created to coordinate and control\r\nthe fulfillment of the national living standard program decided upon by\r\nthe plenum of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\r\nAttached to the Council of Ministers and chaired by a deputy minister,\r\nthe commission is composed of ministers and deputy ministers,\r\nrepresentatives of public organizations, scientists, and other members.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 1971 economic management has been more highly\r\ncentralized than before. A plan for partial decentralization of economic\r\ndecision making adopted in 1965 was abandoned by 1968. The economy is\r\norganized into trusts (officially known as state economic associations)\r\nthat unite enterprises within branches of economic sectors along\r\nfunctional lines, such as metallurgy, textiles, food processing,\r\nrailroads, freight forwarding, tourism, wholesale distribution,\r\npublishing, and filmmaking. In agriculture, trusts are known as\r\nagroindustrial complexes; each complex unites several previously\r\nindependent farms (see ch. 13). Trusts are subordinated to economic\r\nministries and are ultimately responsible to the Council of Ministers.\r\nThe extent of the ministries' authority over trusts is not clear. In\r\nsome important respects trusts receive instructions directly from the\r\nCouncil of Ministers.\r\n\r\nAgroindustrial trusts number 170. In the nonagricultural sector about\r\nsixty-two trusts were originally created, with an average of thirty\r\nbranches but as many as 106 in one instance. The process of\r\nconcentration and centralization continued on a small scale at least\r\nuntil the spring of 1973, in part through the consolidation of separate\r\ntrusts. Before the reorganization, trust branches had been legally and\r\nfinancially independent enterprises, and trusts served only as\r\nadministrative links between enterprises and ministries. Whereas\r\nindividual enterprises were previously regarded as the basic economic\r\nunits in the country, it is the trusts that have been officially\r\nconsidered as such under the new system of management.\r\n\r\nTrusts have assumed various functions previously performed by the\r\nenterprises themselves. They formulate economic and technological\r\ndevelopment policies for the trust as a whole and for each branch;\r\nestablish relations with suppliers, distributors, and financial\r\ninstitutions; and centralize research and development. Trusts have also\r\nbeen charged with responsibility for providing operational guidance to\r\ntheir branches and for organizing the export of products that they\r\nmanufacture. Branches remain responsible for the effective organization\r\nof operations, efficient uses of resources, and the conscientious\r\nfulfillment of tasks assigned to them by the annual plan.\r\n\r\nRegulations governing the authority of trusts over their branches were\r\nintended to permit the establishment of flexible internal management\r\norganizations adapted to the particular needs of each trust. The trusts'\r\npolicies were expected to be based on the rule that whatever the trust\r\ncould do better than the branches should be centralized in it and,\r\nconversely, whatever the branches could do better than the trust should\r\nbe left in their field of competence. Each trust was supposed to arrive\r\nat an optimal combination of management centralization and\r\ndecentralization.\r\n\r\nThe transition to the new management system involved difficulties\r\nbecause of delays in issuing pertinent regulations, misinterpretation of\r\nthe regulations by trust managers, and the reluctance of enterprise\r\nmanagers to acquiesce in the loss of their independence. Most of the\r\norganizational and personnel problems were reported to have been\r\nresolved by the end of 1971, and in March 1973 party chief Todor Zhivkov\r\nreported that further consolidation of the new management structure had\r\nbeen achieved. In the long run, greater efficiency of economic\r\nmanagement is to be attained through pervasive automation of all\r\nmanagement functions with the aid of a synchronized national network of\r\nelectronic computers.\r\n\r\nUnder the new system of trusts, profits of individual branches are\r\npooled and redistributed by the parent organization. Highly productive\r\nbranches may thus find themselves in the position of having to share\r\ntheir profits with unproductive branches. This feature, some observers\r\nbelieve, may reduce incentives to raise the level of efficiency,\r\nincrease output, and improve the quality of products.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND GROWTH\r\n\r\nNational income (net national product, which excludes most services not\r\ndirectly related to production) was officially reported to have been\r\n10.41 billion leva (for value of the lev--see Glossary) in 1971,\r\ncompared to 10.53 billion leva in 1970. Nevertheless, the official index\r\nof national income growth showed an increase of 7 percent from 1970 to\r\n1971. This example illustrates the difficulty of using official\r\nstatistics to describe the structure and growth of the economy or\r\nstructural changes over a period of time.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1971 statistical yearbook for Bulgaria, the respective\r\nshares of industry and agriculture in national income in 1970 were 49\r\nand 22 percent. The yearbook issued in 1972, however, cited 1970 figures\r\nof 55 and 17 percent instead. According to the earlier source, the\r\nproportion of national income contributed by industry increased by 6.5\r\npercent in the 1960-70 period, whereas the subsequent source shows a\r\ngrowth of 17 percent for the same period. Similarly, the contribution of\r\nagriculture to national income was reported to have declined by 36.4 and\r\nby 33.3 percent. An upward trend in the contribution of trade to\r\nnational income was shown in the earlier source, but a declining trend\r\nappeared in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe differences in statistical presentation resulted primarily from a\r\nmajor revision of wholesale prices, introduced by the government in\r\nJanuary 1971. Price revisions made in earlier years, changes in the\r\ncomposition of individual statistical categories and other\r\nmethodological modifications also contributed to the inconsistency of\r\nstatistical time series in value terms. Because of differences in\r\nconcept and coverage, Bulgarian national account data are not comparable\r\nwith those of the United Nations or the United States systems of\r\nnational accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960-71 period national income at prices of 1957 was reported to\r\nhave increased 2.25 times, which is equivalent to an average annual 7.7\r\npercent rate of growth. The growth of national income was more rapid in\r\nthe years 1966 through 1971 than it had been in the 1960-65 period. The\r\nofficial national income index implies an average annual increase of 8.5\r\npercent in the latter period, compared to 6.7 percent in the earlier\r\nyears. Reliable data on the growth of Bulgarian national income in\r\nWestern terms are not available. Relatively high rates of economic\r\ngrowth are generally associated with early stages of industrial\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 industry still lagged behind agriculture in terms of employment,\r\nalthough the proportion of the labor force employed in industry had been\r\nsteadily rising, while employment in agriculture had been declining. In\r\nthe 1960-71 period employment in industry rose from 21.9 to 31.2 percent\r\nof the labor force, and employment in agriculture declined from 54.7 to\r\n33.4 percent of the total. During the same period employment in the\r\nservices sector increased from 9.2 to 13.4 percent of the labor force,\r\nand gains in employment were made in all other economic sectors except\r\nforestry, including construction, transportation and communications, and\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR\r\n\r\nGrowth and productivity of the economy have been adversely affected by\r\nshortages of skilled labor and of adequately trained and experienced\r\ntechnical and executive personnel. In the words of the minister of labor\r\nand social welfare, the level of worker's current training is\r\ninconsistent with the country's industrial base; it lags behind the\r\nrequirements of the scientific and technical revolution. The lack of\r\nrequired skills has contributed to frequent machinery breakdowns and to\r\nthe output of low-quality products. As a means of upgrading the skills\r\nof workers and executives, a broad program for training and retraining\r\nwas launched in October 1972 with the cooperation of the Ministry of\r\nNational Education. About half the number of persons undergoing training\r\nwere below the age of thirty.\r\n\r\nOther persistent shortcomings in the field of labor that have plagued\r\nthe economy and have been the target of frequent criticism and\r\nadministrative action by the leadership are inefficient organization of\r\nlabor and poor labor discipline. Inefficient labor organization has been\r\nmainly an outgrowth of inferior management skills. Poor labor discipline\r\nhas been a consequence of inadequate work incentives. In 1972 the\r\nminister of labor and social welfare estimated that more than 20 percent\r\nof the working time was lost through idling and other violations of\r\nlabor discipline.\r\n\r\nAdequate information on the structure of wages was not available in\r\nmid-1973. The main faults of the wage system that prevailed in early\r\n1973 after repeated revisions, however, were outlined by the BKP leader,\r\nZhivkov, and these faults were also discussed by labor ministry\r\nofficials from the point of view of their effect on labor productivity.\r\nThe basic wage constitutes the main incentive for work; bonuses,\r\npremiums, and honors play a minor role. Because of the large investment\r\nneeds for industrial development and the corollary need to restrict\r\nconsumption, wages have been kept low, and the rise in wages has been\r\nslower than the growth of productivity.\r\n\r\nBasic wage pay has been based on the place of employment and not on the\r\nwork performed. Wage scales for identical work have differed\r\nsubstantially between branches of the economy and industry. In industry,\r\nwage scales have been lower in branches manufacturing consumer goods\r\nthan in branches producing capital goods; they have been lowest in\r\ntextile mills. Wages have been determined by job classifications within\r\neconomic and industrial branches, the workers' level of education, and\r\nlength of service. Normal increases in pay for workers remaining in the\r\nsame positions have therefore been infrequent.\r\n\r\nSlow promotion and the disparity in wage scales contributed to excessive\r\nlabor turnover because, under the prevailing conditions of scarcity,\r\ntrained workers were able to improve their incomes through a change of\r\njobs. It also led to irregularities in job reclassification by employers\r\nseeking to retain their workers through increases in pay. Wages have\r\nbeen raised from time to time by the government through general upward\r\nrevisions of pay scales. This method, however, has no incentive value\r\nbecause it is not directly linked to an improvement in the workers'\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nWith a view to enhancing the stimulative effect of wages on\r\nproductivity, Zhivkov proposed a basic reform of the wage system that\r\nwould be carried out gradually in the 1973-80 period. In presenting his\r\nproposal to the BKP Central Committee plenum, Zhivkov dwelt on some of\r\nthe major principles to be embodied in the new wage system. The minimum\r\nwage must be higher, and the rise in wages must be more rapid than\r\nbefore. Increases in basic wages must be closely linked to individual\r\nperformance and to overall labor productivity in general, pay would be\r\nbased on performance rather than on formal qualification or length of\r\nservice. To this end the sectoral approach to wage determination is to\r\nbe abandoned in favor of a functional approach that would establish a\r\nuniform economy-wide wage scale for jobs in relation to their complexity\r\nand hardship and to the specific conditions of work. Rigid pay scales\r\nare to be replaced by flexible schedules providing a range of pay for\r\neach job depending upon the ability and performance of the worker.\r\n\r\nThe reform would also gradually eliminate the egalitarian aspect of the\r\ncurrent wage system by providing appropriate differentials for workers\r\nwith higher qualifications. Under the current system, for example, the\r\nsalary of economists has been below that of engineers, and the salary of\r\nengineers has been equivalent to the wages of skilled workers. This\r\nproblem has been repeatedly considered in the past, but its solution was\r\ndelayed for lack of funds.\r\n\r\nZhivkov also cited shortcomings of the prevailing piecework system and\r\nsuggested some long-range remedies for the ills. About 60 percent of all\r\nworkers have been employed on the piecework system. Production norms\r\nunder the system have been low because of technological advances and the\r\ninfrequency of adjustment of norms. Under these conditions workers have\r\nbeen able to exceed the basic norms to such an extent that payment for\r\nwork above the norm has become a large, and in some cases the\r\npredominant, portion of the workers' earnings. Striving to increase\r\ntheir wages, workers under the piecework system have often resorted to\r\nshortcuts that have lowered the quality of output.\r\n\r\nZhivkov's proposal for improvement included the introduction of more\r\nrealistic and more flexible quantitative and qualitative production\r\nnorms and a gradual transition to hourly rates of pay with bonus\r\npayments for superior work whenever the quantity and quality of output\r\nis not directly dependent on individual workers. Under these conditions\r\nbonus payments would be linked to the performance of the entire working\r\npersonnel, and the importance of the bonus in wage payments would be\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\nThe wage reform has been discussed in the context of a broad program,\r\nannounced by the BKP Central Committee plenum in December 1972, for a\r\ngeneral rise in incomes and an improvement in the population's level of\r\nliving. In the process the difference between urban and lagging rural\r\nincomes is to be eliminated. Implementation of the program has been made\r\ncontingent upon the attainment of greater productivity and output\r\nthrough workers' efforts to surpass production and efficiency targets\r\nset by the government. These more difficult targets must be embodied in\r\nwhat have been officially labeled workers' counterplans. The BKP and\r\nthe government have launched a new form of so-called socialist\r\ncompetition among workers and economic units, the aim of which is to\r\nexceed in performance the requirements of the counterplans.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the standard of living program began with the\r\nintroduction of wage increases, effective March 1, 1973, for workers\r\nemployed under difficult or hazardous conditions, schoolteachers and\r\nuniversity faculties, physicians and medical personnel, and employees of\r\nartistic and cultural institutions. Effective June 1 the minimum wage\r\nfor all types of work was raised from 65 to 80 leva per month, and a\r\nlevel of 88 leva per month was decreed for all workers earning between\r\n80 and 87 leva. The resultant distortion of the wage structure is to be\r\neliminated over a period of several years.\r\n\r\nAnother important measure affecting labor was announced in March 1973--a\r\ngradual transition from a six-day, forty-six-hour workweek to a five-day\r\nweek of forty-two and a half hours. Under the BKP directive the\r\ntransition must be accomplished without loss in production; the loss in\r\nworktime must be compensated by a corresponding rise in productivity.\r\nThe shorter workweek had been in effect on an experimental basis for\r\nabout 17 percent of the industrial workers since 1968. In 1973 and 1974\r\nit was to be introduced in enterprises of the material production\r\nsector, excluding agriculture, provided that the required rise in\r\nproductivity has been assured. In 1975 the reduced workweek will be\r\nintroduced in transport, for management of state economic enterprises,\r\nand for persons employed in the field of services other than health\r\nservices and educational institutions. Preparations for experiments with\r\na shortened workweek in these two areas and in agriculture are to be\r\nundertaken in 1974 and 1975. The decree on working hours gave formal\r\napproval to an established practice that requires workers to make up by\r\nwork on Saturdays or Sundays for worktime lost whenever official\r\nholidays fall on weekdays.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTMENT\r\n\r\nThe proportion of national income devoted annually to capital formation\r\n(net investment) rose steadily from 22.6 percent in 1961 to 35.4 percent\r\nin 1966 and 1967 and declined thereafter progressively to 26.8 percent\r\nin 1971. In absolute terms annual capital formation increased from 1.06\r\nbillion leva in 1961 to 3.06 billion leva in 1970, then declined to 2.74\r\nbillion leva in 1971. More than half the net addition to capital (from\r\n46 to 67 percent annually) consisted of fixed assets; the balance\r\nrepresented equipment and inventories.\r\n\r\nGross investment at current prices increased from 1.4 billion leva in\r\n1961 to 3.6 billion leva in 1971; investment was officially estimated at\r\n3.9 billion leva in 1972 and was scheduled to reach 4.3 billion leva in\r\n1973. The bulk of investment has been channeled into the material\r\nproduction sector (including trade). The annual investment share of\r\nthis sector increased from about 74 percent in 1960 to 79 percent in\r\n1969 and declined to 76 percent in 1971. The proportion of investment\r\ndevoted to housing and services declined correspondingly in the 1960-69\r\nperiod from 26 to 21 percent and rose in the subsequent two years to 24\r\npercent. The shift in the investment trend foreshadowed the formal\r\ndirective issued by the Tenth Party Congress in April 1971 for the\r\ndevelopment of a program to raise the population's standard of living.\r\n\r\nIndustry has been the main beneficiary of investment funds; its share\r\nrose to almost 50 percent in 1969 but declined slightly thereafter.\r\nAgriculture received only about 15 percent of investment in the years\r\n1969 through 1971, compared to 28 percent in 1960 and 19 percent in\r\n1965. Residential investment declined from 14 percent in 1960 to an\r\naverage of not quite 10 percent in the 1969-71 period.\r\n\r\nBuilding construction and installation work absorbed the largest, though\r\ndeclining, share of investment--60 percent in 1960 and 46.4 percent in\r\n1971. The share of investment spent on machinery and equipment rose by\r\n50 percent in the 1960-69 period from 26 to 39 percent, but declined to\r\n34 percent in 1970 and 37 percent in 1971. Imported machinery, mostly\r\nfrom the Soviet Union, constituted a major though declining proportion\r\nof investment in machinery--from two-thirds to one-half of the total in\r\nthe 1965-71 period. Other investment expenses, including geological\r\nsurveys, absorbed from 12 to 17 percent of annual investment.\r\n\r\nNew investment has been increasingly concentrated in state enterprises.\r\nIn the 1960-71 period the proportion of investment absorbed by state\r\nenterprises increased from 68 to 83 percent, while the share of\r\ninvestment devoted to collective farms declined from 18 to 8.5 percent.\r\nAnnual investment in artisans' collectives rose from 1.2 percent of\r\ntotal investment in 1960 to 2.7 percent in 1968 and declined to 1.1\r\npercent in 1971. This trend paralleled the government's policy of\r\ninitial encouragement and subsequent restriction of private artisan\r\nactivities; it suggests that the government's restrictive policy may not\r\nhave been limited to private artisans alone (see Organization, this\r\nch.).\r\n\r\nPrivate investment in residential construction declined from 12.7\r\npercent of annual investment in 1960 to 6.5 percent in 1970 but rose to\r\n7.2 percent in 1971. In absolute terms private investment increased from\r\nabout 174 million leva to 262 million leva. By 1973, however, new\r\nrestrictions were being introduced on housing construction by private\r\nindividuals. As much as 90 percent of the residential construction in\r\n1960 and 70 percent in 1971 was privately financed. In the 1968-70\r\nperiod about half the private investment in housing was supported by\r\nbank loans or by loans from special funds of employing organizations.\r\n\r\nThe rise in the volume of capital per worker in the 1960-70 period as a\r\nresult of the investment activity did not produce a corresponding\r\nincrease in labor productivity; that is, the efficiency of investment\r\ndeclined. Whereas the amount of fixed capital per worker in the sphere\r\nof material production increased at an average annual rate of 10.4\r\npercent, and the volume of machinery and inventories rose by 12.5\r\npercent per year, output per worker increased at an annual rate of only\r\n7.7 percent. In an effort to increase the efficiency of investment, the\r\nTenth Party Congress, convened in the spring of 1971, directed that 35\r\npercent of new investment in the sphere of material production during\r\nthe 1971-75 period should be used for the reconstruction and\r\nmodernization of existing facilities. In 1972, however, the proportion\r\nof investment used for this purpose was only 18 percent.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the eventually abandoned program for economic\r\ndecentralization, provision was made for reducing the role of the\r\ncentral government budget in financing investments and for increasing\r\nparticipation by investors with their own funds and bank credits. In the\r\nsphere of material production, excluding trade, budgetary allocations in\r\n1965 accounted for 55 percent of investment, and bank credits made up 7\r\npercent; in 1969 investment funds from these sources constituted 21 and\r\n32 percent, respectively. The contribution from the budget, however,\r\nrose again after 1969 to 28 percent in 1971, whereas bank credits\r\ndeclined to less than 20 percent of the investment funds. The share of\r\ninvestors' own resources, including funds of local governments,\r\nincreased from 36 percent in 1965 to 52 percent in 1971. Budgetary\r\ninvestment funds are being increasingly concentrated on projects in the\r\nfields of services and raw materials production.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory explanation of the shifts in the pattern of investment\r\nfinancing is not feasible in the absence of adequate information on the\r\nchanging methods of financing economic enterprises and organizations.\r\nThe announced government policy is to shift financing progressively from\r\nthe budget to the economic trusts. The shifts did not alter the\r\nfundamental fact that all investment funds, excluding the small private\r\ninvestment, remained public property subject to governmental controls\r\nand that the difference was merely one of bookkeeping. The change in the\r\nchanneling of public investment funds was introduced in the hope of\r\nincreasing the effectiveness of their use.\r\n\r\nThe realization of major investment projects, particularly in industry,\r\nhas been made possible by very substantial technical and material\r\nassistance from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, serious shortcomings\r\nhave been officially reported in the implementation of investment\r\nprograms, both in industrial and in residential construction. The main\r\nproblem has been posed by the initiation of building programs that\r\nexceed the capacity of the construction industry and the consequent\r\nscattering of limited resources. The situation has been aggravated by\r\nfrequently poor project planning, inferior design, delays in the\r\ndelivery of machinery and materials, poor organization of work, and\r\nslack discipline.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the difficulties in construction, the completion and\r\ncommissioning of new industrial plants has often been delayed, and\r\nhousing construction has fallen chronically short of the volume\r\nplanned--by as much as 25 percent in 1972. The consequent failure of the\r\nanticipated output from new plants to materialize created shortages in\r\nvarious areas, thereby affecting production and market supplies\r\nadversely and necessitating revisions of the economic plans. In an\r\neffort to minimize these difficulties, the government adopted various\r\nadministrative measures in 1971 and 1972, including the formulation of a\r\nlist of nationally important construction projects, direct supervision\r\nof which was assumed by the Council of Ministers. The number of projects\r\nincluded in the list for 1972 was variously reported as thirty-five and\r\nthirty-nine out of a total of more than 3,000 projects. The listed\r\nprojects consisted mainly of plants for the production of industrial\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDGET\r\n\r\nThe budget constitutes the basic financial plan of the country's\r\nleadership. It is the monetary expression of the annual socioeconomic\r\nplan and provides for the financial flows implicit in that plan. The\r\nbudget is comprehensive; it takes into account all aspects of the\r\neconomic, social, and cultural activities of the country. In line with\r\nthe government's policy of gradually placing economic trusts and their\r\nbranches on a self-financing basis, a progressively larger share of the\r\nfunds budgeted for the economy is being retained by the trusts rather\r\nthan channeled to the budget. The sums thus retained by economic\r\norganization rose from about 3 billion leva in 1971 to a planned level\r\nof more than 5 billion leva in 1973. Ultimate control over the use of\r\nthese funds, nevertheless, remains with the government, and their\r\ndisposition is subject to the provisions of the budget.\r\n\r\nThe national budget is formulated by the Ministry of Finance along lines\r\ndictated by the BKP leadership and must be approved by the National\r\nAssembly. As a rule only very minor modifications are made in the\r\nprocess of legislative review. Budgets for local governments are\r\nprepared as a part of the national budget; in 1972 and 1973 their total\r\namount was equivalent to about 17 percent of the overall national\r\nbudget. The Ministry of Finance is also responsible for ensuring the\r\nscrupulous implementation of the budget. It is assisted in this task by\r\na nationwide network of state and local inspectors and by agents of the\r\nbanks. Actual budgetary results are directly affected by deviations from\r\nthe annual economic plan and therefore seldom, if ever, correspond to\r\nthe original estimates, which have the force of law.\r\n\r\nSystematic publication of budgetary data was discontinued in the\r\nmid-1960s. Since then only scattered figures have become available\r\nthrough press reports on the presentation of the budget to the National\r\nAssembly and occasional articles by the minister of finance or other\r\nministry officials.\r\n\r\nThe annual budgets have grown steadily larger. The approved budget for\r\n1973 called for revenues of 7,057 million leva and expenditures of 7,035\r\nmillion leva. In 1970 actual revenues totaled 5,723 million leva, the\r\nexpenditures amounted to 5,650 million leva. Usually about 90 percent of\r\nbudgetary revenue has been derived from operations of the economy, and\r\nthe remainder has been raised through a variety of levies on the\r\npopulation. The largest single item of revenue--more than 30 percent of\r\nthe total--has been collected in the form of a turnover tax on sales\r\nthat has been passed on to the ultimate consumer. The second most\r\nimportant revenue source has consisted of levies on enterprises in the\r\nform of a profits tax, a tax on fixed capital (interest charge) and\r\nmiscellaneous other deductions from income. Social security taxes based\r\non payrolls have been the third major source. Levied at a rate of 12.5\r\npercent through 1972, the social security tax was raised by 20 percent\r\nin 1973 in order to meet rising costs. In 1972 about four-fifths of the\r\nturnover tax and two-thirds of the revenue from taxes on profits and\r\ncapital was to be derived from industry.\r\n\r\nIn December 1972 the BKP Central Committee plenum embarked upon a\r\ngradual modification of the income tax system that would eventually lead\r\nto a total abolition of income taxes for wage earners and collective\r\nfarmers by 1980. Initially, the existing system is to be improved by\r\nintroducing unified taxation for all blue- and white-collar workers and\r\ncollective farmers and by establishing a tax exemption equal to the\r\nofficial minimum rate of pay. Gradual elimination of all income taxes\r\nfor these population groups in the 1976-80 period is to be synchronized\r\nwith the contemplated reform of wage scales. At the same time a system\r\nof progressive taxation is to be introduced on incomes derived from\r\nactivities in the private sector that are not in conformity with the\r\namount of labor invested.\r\n\r\nThe most complete recent information on budgetary expenditures is\r\navailable from the approved budget for 1972. Out of a total outlay of\r\n6,514 million leva, 3,224 million leva was earmarked for the national\r\neconomy, and 2,065 million leva was set aside for social and cultural\r\nneeds. The remaining undisclosed balance of 1,225 million leva, or 19\r\npercent of the total outlays, must have included expenditures for\r\ndefense, internal security, and government administration. The social\r\nand cultural expenditures included; social security payments, 1,054\r\nmillion leva; education, 532 million leva; public health, 303 million\r\nleva; culture and arts, 83 million leva; and science, 93 million leva,\r\nin addition to 235 million leva to be provided by research organizations\r\nand economic trusts.\r\n\r\nInformation on the budget for 1973 was more sketchy. No information had\r\nbeen disclosed on the magnitude of the expenditure on the national\r\neconomy; the usually undisclosed residual was therefore also not\r\nascertainable. The increase in overall revenues and expenditures over\r\nthose in 1972 was about 8 percent. Outlays for social and cultural\r\naffairs, however, were planned to increase by 11.8 percent, including\r\nincreases of 18.8 and 15.7 percent, respectively, for public health and\r\neducation. These figures reflected the government's announced program\r\nfor increasing the well-being of the population.\r\n\r\nThe BKP and government leadership look upon the budget as a major tool\r\nfor executing BKP economic policies. As expressed by the minister of\r\nfinance in 1973, the budget contains a whole arsenal of financial and\r\neconomic levers--levers that must be used ever more skillfully to raise\r\nthe efficiency of economic performance, to improve the structure of\r\nproduction and consumption, and to bring about a well-balanced economy.\r\nThe budget is also considered a tool for exercising effective control\r\nover the entire sphere of production and services, not only to ensure\r\nsmooth current operations but also to inhibit any undesirable departures\r\nfrom official policy.\r\n\r\nThe disciplinary powers of the budget have yet to be more fully\r\ndeveloped to cope successfully with the officially reported shortcomings\r\nin the economy. One step in this direction calls for the further\r\nintensification of what has been officially called financial and bank\r\ncontrol through the lev, that is, the discretionary use of financial\r\nsanctions, including the denial of budgetary allocations or bank\r\ncredits, to enforce strict compliance with specific plan directives.\r\nAnother advocated measure is to intensify the public campaign against\r\nwaste and the irresponsible attitude toward public funds and for tighter\r\nfinancial discipline. An implacable campaign is also to be waged against\r\nwrongs done to the citizens in the use of public funds, illegal\r\nformation and misappropriation of funds by economic organizations,\r\nirregularities in the supply of materials, failure to produce consumer\r\ngoods despite the availability of needed resources, accumulation of\r\nexcessive inventories, and pilferage.\r\n\r\nMany apparent violations of economic and budgetary discipline arise\r\nbecause of the frequently inadequate knowledge or understanding by\r\npersonnel at all levels of the economy of the constantly changing laws\r\nand regulations concerning the operation and interrelation of the\r\ndiverse economic units, particularly in the area of finance. The changes\r\nin laws and regulations are the result of an unceasing search for a\r\nsystem that would provide effective incentives toward conscientious and\r\nefficient work to all gainfully employed persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKING AND CURRENCY\r\n\r\nBanking\r\n\r\nSince early 1971 the country's banking system has consisted of the\r\nBulgarian National Bank and two semi-independent banks attached to it:\r\nthe Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank and the State Savings Bank. This\r\nbanking system emerged after three reorganizations in the 1967-70 period\r\nand conforms to the general pattern of institutional and management\r\nconcentration in the economy. In addition to serving as the central bank\r\nof issue, the Bulgarian National Bank, an independent agency under the\r\nCouncil of Ministers, is directly responsible for financing all sectors\r\nand phases of the economy other than foreign trade and consumer credit,\r\nin which fields it supervises the activities of the Bulgarian Foreign\r\nTrade Bank and the State Savings Bank. The bank is also responsible for\r\nexercising close control over the economic units that it finances, with\r\na view to ensuring the fulfillment of all national economic plans and\r\nthe scrupulous adherence to existing laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nA minimum of current information was available in mid-1973 on the\r\nstructure of the banks, the relationships between them, and their\r\nfinancial operations. Official statistics are limited to annual data on\r\nbank credits for investment and on the volume of outstanding short- and\r\nlong-term loan balances for the banking system as a whole. Data on\r\noutstanding loans are broken down by type of borrower and, in the case\r\nof short-term loans, also by purpose. With minor exceptions, no\r\ninformation was available on the volume of loans extended, on loan\r\nmaturities, or on interest rates after 1970. Statistics had also been\r\npublished on the volume of personal savings in the accounts of the\r\nsaving bank at the end of each year.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of loans outstanding at the end of the year increased\r\nfrom 3.6 billion leva in 1965 to 9.2 billion leva in 1971. The\r\nproportion of long-term loan balances rose from 24 percent of the total\r\namount in 1965 to 40 percent in 1970 but declined to less than 36\r\npercent in 1971. The increase in lending activity to 1970 was a direct\r\nconsequence of the partial shift from predominantly budgetary financing\r\nof economic activities to a substantial measure of self-financing by\r\nenterprises and trusts. The subsequent decline was related to the\r\ntightening of investment credit in an effort to reduce waste in the\r\nconstruction program (see Investment, this ch.). Long-term loans have\r\nbeen granted predominantly, if not exclusively, for fixed investment\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOf the 3.27 billion leva in long-term loans outstanding at the end of\r\n1971, 2.61 billion leva was due from state and collective enterprises,\r\nand 660 million leva was owed by private individuals who had borrowed to\r\nfinance home construction. Only 12.5 percent of the loan balances was\r\ndue from collective farms--an amount equivalent to barely 62 percent of\r\nthe sums owed by private individuals. Collective enterprises in industry\r\nand services had outstanding loans of only 13 million leva. In relation\r\nto the value of each sector's fixed assets in 1971, the proportion of\r\noutstanding long-term loans was: state enterprises, 11.3 percent;\r\ncollective farms, 16.1 percent; and collective artisans, 2.9 percent.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the short-term loan balances at the end of 1971 were owed\r\nby state enterprises, and one-tenth was due from collective enterprises.\r\nWholesale and retail trade accounted for 36 percent of the outstanding\r\nloans; industry and construction were each liable for 28 percent.\r\nShort-term loan balances of agriculture amounted to less than 8 percent\r\nof the total sum, and balances of the services sector constituted less\r\nthan 0.2 percent. The largest part of short-term loans was granted for\r\nworking capital purposes, including the procurement of farm products. A\r\nbalance of almost 1 billion leva, however, was outstanding on loans for\r\nthe completion of building construction, including a small amount for\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\nA very small, though increasing, volume of consumer loans for the\r\npurchase of durable goods and clothing has been granted by the State\r\nSavings Bank. The volume of such loans--36.5 million leva in 1966, 48.2\r\nmillion leva in 1967, and 45.4 million leva in 1968--was equivalent to\r\nslightly more than 1 percent of retail sales in the commercial trade\r\nnetwork. The outstanding balances of consumer loans at the end of the\r\nyear rose from 49.1 million leva in 1968 to 102.1 million leva in 1971.\r\nConsumer loans may not exceed the sum of 500 leva and may be used only\r\nfor the purchase of designated goods. In 1969 the authorized list\r\nincluded twenty-three categories. A sample survey in 1969 indicated that\r\nabout two-thirds of the loan volume was used to acquire television sets,\r\nfurniture, and motorcycles; another 20 percent was spent on radios,\r\nsewing machines, and scooters.\r\n\r\nApart from consumer loans, the State Savings Bank grants small loans to\r\nlicensed private craftsmen for working capital and to collective and\r\nstate farmworkers and other qualified applicants for the purchase of\r\nproductive livestock, seeds, fertilizers, small tools, and other farm\r\nperquisites. The bank also makes loans for adapting premises to the\r\nneeds of tourism; for current building repairs; and for meeting personal\r\nemergencies, including loans to newlyweds for the acquisition of\r\nfurnishings. Depending upon the purpose of the loans, loan ceilings\r\nrange from 150 to 800 leva, and maturities extend from ten months to\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nThe volume of consumer loans was reported to have reached 116 million\r\nleva in 1972. Under the economic plan for 1973, the State Savings Bank\r\nwas scheduled to make loans to individuals for the purchase of consumer\r\ngoods and other needs in the amount of 203 million leva and for home\r\nconstruction in the amount of 180 million leva. The bank was also\r\nexpected to lend 141 million leva to people's councils.\r\n\r\nLoan funds of the State Savings Bank have been derived from personal\r\nsavings deposits and, presumably, from interest payments. The bank also\r\nconducts state lotteries for the benefit of the state budget. There is\r\nno evidence as to whether the bank retains a portion of the lottery\r\nproceeds for its own operations. Savings deposits increased almost\r\nfivefold in the 1960-71 period to a level of about 3.6 billion leva--a\r\nsum equivalent to 64 percent of total retail sales or 150 percent of\r\nfood sales through commercial and institutional channels in 1970.\r\nAccording to preliminary data, savings deposits rose by 630 million leva\r\nin 1972, and they were scheduled to increase further by 870 million leva\r\nunder the economic plan for 1973. The bulk of savings deposits has been\r\nchanneled into the budget.\r\n\r\nThe repayment record on loans by the State Savings Bank was excellent,\r\nat least through 1969. The proportion of delinquent loans was reduced\r\nfrom 3.1 percent in 1966 to 0.01 percent in 1969. This result was\r\nachieved by a regulation that provided for penalties to be imposed on\r\npaymasters throughout the economy who failed to withhold or to report to\r\nthe bank monthly loan payments. According to a bank official, there had\r\nbeen no need to impose any penalties because the regulation itself\r\nproved to be an adequate deterrent.\r\n\r\nThe loan repayment record of enterprises, trusts, and other economic\r\norganizations has not been nearly so good and led to a tightening of\r\ncredit provisions in 1971. The proportion of overdue short-term loans in\r\nthe production sector increased from 10.7 percent in 1966 to 11.8\r\npercent in 1971. Similar information on long-term loans has not been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nThe penalty interest rate on delinquent loans is 10 percent (it was 8\r\npercent through 1970), compared to a normal range of 1 to 5 percent on\r\nloans for working capital. Whenever a bank loan or supplier credit is\r\ndelinquent for more than three months and the delinquent amount exceeds\r\n20 percent of the borrower's working capital, the borrower becomes\r\nsubject to a special credit and repayment regime, the specific\r\nconditions of which are not known. The ultimate sanction is the refusal\r\nof credit and, at times, even the replacement of the trust or enterprise\r\ndirector. The special credit regime is also applied whenever a trust or\r\nits branch (enterprise) stockpiles unneeded inventories; procures\r\nmaterials for production without guaranteed outlets for the output;\r\nundertakes a construction program without adequate financial provisions;\r\nincreases its obligations; or suffers a worsening of its financial\r\ncondition for any other reason.\r\n\r\nInterest costs in excess of those planned lower the economic\r\norganization's income and, under the prevailing incentives system, also\r\nreduce the funds available for the payment of wages, salaries, and\r\nbonuses. Loan delinquency and the associated penalty interest rate,\r\ntherefore, often bring about the reduction or elimination of bonus\r\npayments and, in extreme cases, the withholding of a portion of regular\r\npay. Application of the more severe sanctions entails a serious\r\ndeterioration of the economic organization's finances that adversely\r\naffects its production program. Through close contact with borrowers and\r\ndetailed supervision of their operations the bank endeavors to forestall\r\ndelinquencies and the attendant losses to the economy. In December 1972\r\nthe Council of Ministers adopted a decision to enhance the role of the\r\nbanking system in administering the economy by intensifying its\r\nparticipation in the formulation of economic plans and by expanding its\r\nauthority in monitoring plan fulfillment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrency\r\n\r\nThe currency unit of the country is the lev, divided into 100 stotinki\r\n(see Glossary). It is a nonconvertible currency with a variety of\r\nexchange rates, usable only in domestic transactions. Since January 1,\r\n1962, the lev has been officially defined to contain 759.548 milligrams\r\nof fine gold--equivalent to 1.17 leva per US$1 at that time. This\r\nexchange rate was valid only for commercial transactions. In the wake of\r\nthe United States dollar devaluation on December 18, 1971, the official\r\ncommercial exchange rate was set at 1.08 leva per US$1 (greenback--see\r\nGlossary). A further revision of the exchange rate was put into effect\r\non February 13, 1973, which established a parity of 0.97 leva per US$1.\r\nThe subsequent decline in the value of the dollar in foreign markets did\r\nnot call forth another official exchange revaluation to mid-1973.\r\n\r\nThe official tourist exchange rate for so-called capitalist currencies\r\nunderwent similar revisions and was set at 1.65 leva per US$1 on\r\nFebruary 14, 1973. The noncommercial rate for ruble area countries,\r\nbased on a parity of 0.78 leva per 1 ruble, was equivalent to 0.64 leva\r\nper US$1 until that date; thereafter, at the new ruble-United States\r\ndollar parity, it was equivalent to about 0.59 leva per US$1.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the official exchange rates, there are three varieties of\r\nclearing account rates. The multilateral transferable ruble is used to\r\nclear accounts with other European members of the Council for Mutual\r\nEconomic Assistance (COMECON--see Glossary). Socialist bilateral units\r\narise from bilateral trade agreements with other communist countries.\r\nNeither of these two exchange varieties has private markets abroad.\r\nBilateral clearing units arise from bilateral trade and payments\r\nagreements with about thirty noncommunist trading partners. These\r\nclearing units are traded sporadically abroad at varying rates of\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\nThe lev has been traded on the black market in exchange for so-called\r\ncapitalist banknotes or gold coins. The black market rate of the lev\r\nfluctuated between 4.60 leva per US$1 in January 1963 and 2.58 leva per\r\nUS$1 in June 1972.\r\n\r\nExcept for small remittances or travel allocations to other communist\r\ncountries, the lev is nontransferable for residents; resident status\r\napplies to all physical and juridical persons who have resided in the\r\ncountry for more than six months, regardless of their citizenship.\r\nOwnership of or trade in gold, foreign currencies, or so-called\r\ncapitalist securities is prohibited, as is the import and export of\r\nBulgarian banknotes. There are no investments by noncommunist country\r\nnationals in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nExchange transactions are administered by the Bulgarian National Bank\r\njointly with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and\r\nthe Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank. Bulgaria is neither a member of the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development nor of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund. Statistics on currency in circulation, the\r\npublic debt, foreign exchange reserves, gold stocks, and the balance of\r\npayments have not been published.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\nForeign trade is a state monopoly. Trade policy is formulated by the BKP\r\nand government leadership; it is translated into a complex set of laws\r\nand regulations designed to encourage the expansion and qualitative\r\nimprovement of production for export, to promote import substitution,\r\nand to bring about greater efficiency in production and foreign trade\r\noperations. Control over foreign trade is shared by the Ministry of\r\nForeign Trade, the Ministry of Finance, and the Bulgarian National Bank\r\nthrough the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank.\r\n\r\nAlong with other elements of the economic structure, the foreign trade\r\napparatus and the laws and regulations governing foreign trade have been\r\nfrequently modified. As a result, there are two basic types of foreign\r\ntrade organization: those attached to and serving individual economic\r\ntrusts with a large export volume and organizations serving several\r\ntrusts whose export activity did not justify a separate export\r\ndepartment. Two foreign trade organizations that imported most\r\nindustrial materials were attached to economic trusts responsible for\r\nthe domestic distribution of supplies. Foreign trade organizations\r\naffiliated with trusts retain their legal identity and are not\r\nconsidered to be branches of the trusts they serve. Relations between\r\nforeign trade organizations and the trusts whose products they handle\r\nare governed by contracts, the framework of which is provided by\r\nofficial regulations. As a rule, foreign trade organizations carry on\r\ntheir activities for the account of the trust. There are a few\r\norganizations, however, that trade for their own account, and there are\r\nalso a few economic trusts that have the right to engage in foreign\r\ntrade activity directly.\r\n\r\nExport plans are approved by the Council of Ministers for each economic\r\ntrust in physical and value terms and by major trading areas, that is,\r\nmember countries of COMECON, other communist countries, Western\r\nindustrialized nations, and developing countries. Trusts pass their\r\ntrade plans to foreign trade organizations. The plan of a single trust\r\nmay be apportioned among several foreign trade organizations, and many\r\nforeign trade organizations receive plan assignments from several trusts\r\nso that their own foreign trade plan is a composite.\r\n\r\nUnder the regulations of 1971, as amplified in 1972, and unlike earlier\r\nconditions, the financial results of export operations are directly\r\nreflected in the producer's profit position. This circumstance is\r\ncounted upon by the leadership to motivate trusts toward attaining\r\noptimum efficiency in export production and toward adjusting output to\r\nforeign market requirements. Financial incentives to surpass official\r\nforeign trade targets are provided by allocating the producers and\r\nforeign trade organizations a portion of the receipts from excess\r\nexports and a portion of savings made on imports through import\r\nsubstitution. Excess exports may not be made by diverting output\r\nscheduled for the domestic market, and savings on imports may not be\r\nmade at the cost of quantitative or qualitative deterioration of the\r\ndomestic supply.\r\n\r\nProducers for export are obligated both to produce the items called for\r\nby the export plan in accordance with specifications and to meet\r\ncontractual delivery dates; with few exceptions, they have no direct\r\ncontact with foreign buyers. It is the responsibility of the foreign\r\ntrade organizations to seek out the most profitable markets and to\r\nhandle all physical and financial details of the trade transactions. It\r\nis also their duty to keep producers currently informed about changing\r\nconditions in world markets and to make them aware of needed adjustments\r\nin production.\r\n\r\nStandard subsidies per 100 leva, differing by trading area, are granted\r\non all exports. These subsidies, in effect, modify the official exchange\r\nrate so that trade is actually conducted on a multiple exchange rate\r\nbasis. Subsidies from the state budget are also provided for exports,\r\nthe returns from which do not cover costs. Special bonuses are offered\r\nto economic trusts and their branches that fulfill or surpass their\r\nexport assignments to noncommunist markets. Proceeds from exports are\r\ncredited to the economic trusts and not to the foreign trade\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nRelations between economic trusts and foreign trade organizations are\r\ndetermined in broad outline by government regulations. Specific details,\r\nhowever, including precise financial arrangements that are the core of\r\nthe relationship, must be worked out by the parties to the contract.\r\nThis situation provides opportunities for friction that may be harmful\r\nto the export program. Trusts and export associations were therefore\r\nenjoined to undertake negotiations in a cooperative spirit and to avoid\r\ntaking advantage of their monopoly position as producers or exporters.\r\nDisputes that threaten to involve financial losses are to be settled by\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nTotal trade turnover increased more than 3.5 times in the 1960-71 period\r\nto a level of 5 billion leva, including 2.55 billion leva in exports and\r\n2.45 billion leva in imports. The growth of trade was erratic,\r\nparticularly in the case of imports. Over the entire 1960-68 period,\r\nhowever, the average annual growth of exports and imports was almost\r\nidentical--13.9 and 13.8 percent, respectively. In the subsequent three\r\nyears exports rose almost twice as rapidly as imports, though at a\r\nlower rate than in earlier years. The change in the relative rates of\r\ngrowth during the 1969-71 period--10.5 percent for exports and 5.6\r\npercent for imports--helped reverse the consistently negative trade\r\nbalance of the earlier period and produced trade surpluses in three\r\nconsecutive years.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the trade has been carried on with communist\r\ncountries, primarily the Soviet Union. The share of these countries in\r\ntotal trade, however, declined from 85 percent in 1961 to 78 percent in\r\n1970; it had fallen to 73 percent in 1966. Communist countries outside\r\nCOMECON, primarily Cuba and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North\r\nVietnam), accounted for only 3 to 4 percent of the trade annually. The\r\nSoviet Union alone provided more than half the imports and absorbed an\r\nequal amount of exports. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany)\r\nand Czechoslovakia were the main COMECON trading partners after the\r\nSoviet Union, but the volume of trade with these countries was very much\r\nlower. The share of East Germany in the total trade had been 10.5\r\npercent in 1960 but ranged between 8 and 8.6 percent in the 1965-70\r\nperiod. The proportion of trade with Czechoslovakia declined from 9.7\r\npercent in 1960 to only 4.8 percent in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe orientation of trade toward the Soviet Union has been based largely\r\non political factors but has also been dictated by the shortage of\r\nexport goods salable in Western markets and the inadequacy of foreign\r\nexchange reserves (see ch. 10). Trade with COMECON members is conducted\r\non the basis of bilateral clearing accounts that do not involve the use\r\nof foreign exchange. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has supplied Bulgaria\r\nwith a large volume of industrial plants and equipment in exchange for\r\nthe products of these plants. In the 1971-75 period trade with the\r\nSoviet Union is scheduled to increase by 60 percent over the volume in\r\nthe preceding five-year period, and the share of the Soviet Union in the\r\ntotal trade volume is planned to reach 68 percent.\r\n\r\nTrade with noncommunist countries rose from about 15 percent of the\r\ntotal volume in 1961 to 27 percent in 1966 but declined thereafter to 22\r\npercent in 1970. From three-fourths to four-fifths of this trade was\r\naccounted for by Western industrialized nations, primarily the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany (West Germany), Italy, France and Great Britain. The\r\nbalance of the noncommunist trade was with developing countries, mainly\r\nIndia, the United Arab Republic (UAR), and Iraq. Trade with the United\r\nStates has been negligible.\r\n\r\nThere has been a gradual shift in exports from agricultural to\r\nindustrial commodities and from raw materials to manufactured and\r\nsemiprocessed products. Yet in 1970 exports of agricultural origin still\r\nconstituted 55 percent of the export volume, including 8 percent of raw\r\nfarm products. The share of industrial exports rose from 25 percent in\r\n1960 to 45 percent in 1970, of which 13 and 27 percent, respectively,\r\nconsisted of machinery and equipment. In 1972 the proportion of\r\nmachinery and equipment in exports was reported to have risen to 34\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nMachinery and equipment have been exported almost exclusively to\r\ncommunist and developing countries. In 1968, the last year for which\r\ninformation was available, machinery and equipment constituted only 1.8\r\npercent of exports to Western industrialized nations.\r\n\r\nImports in the 1960-70 period consisted predominantly of machinery and\r\nequipment, fuels, raw and processed industrial materials, and raw farm\r\ncommodities. Imports of foods and industrial consumer goods were limited\r\nto about 10 percent per year. Machinery and equipment constituted from\r\n40 to 44 percent of imports; fuels and industrial materials accounted\r\nfor about one-third; and agricultural raw materials made up the balance.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960-70 period the country's overall trade balance was negative\r\neach year with the exception of 1969 and 1970. The trade deficit for the\r\nentire period amounted to 580 million leva, including 530 million leva\r\nin the trade with noncommunist countries and 50 million leva in the\r\ntrade with communist partners. A breakdown of the trade balance by all\r\nfour trading areas was available only for the 1965-70 period. For that\r\nperiod the overall trade deficit amounted to 278 million leva. Whereas\r\ntrade with communist and developing countries had positive balances of\r\n148 million leva and 154 million leva, trade with developed Western\r\ncountries accumulated a deficit of 580 million leva. Almost all of this\r\ndeficit was incurred in the years 1965 through 1967, when government\r\ncontrols over foreign trade were temporarily relaxed in an aborted\r\neconomic reform. Under the system of bilateral agreements governing\r\nBulgaria's trade, the surplus in the trade with communist and developing\r\ncountries cannot be used to offset the deficit with Western trading\r\npartners.\r\n\r\nData bearing on the balance of payments have never been published. The\r\nSoviet Union has granted substantial loans to Bulgaria since 1946, some\r\nof which were used to finance imports from that country. Bulgaria, in\r\nturn, has made some loans to developing countries to help finance its\r\nexports. A portion of the deficit with Western trading partners may be\r\noffset by income from the rising Western European tourist trade,\r\nparticularly with West Germany. A reputable Western source reported\r\nBulgaria's indebtedness to Western nations to have been US$88 million in\r\n1971, but the basis of this estimate and the degree of its reliability\r\nare not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1973 the country's political and governmental\r\nleadership expressed serious concern about the uneven growth of\r\nagriculture over a period of several years. Although wheat production\r\nhad progressed satisfactorily and reached a record level in 1972, and\r\ngood results had also been obtained in the cultivation of tobacco and\r\ntomatoes--both of which are important export crops--the expansionary\r\ntrend in fruit growing was reversed in 1968, and cattle raising had\r\nstagnated for at least a decade.\r\n\r\nThe situation was particularly disappointing to the leadership because\r\nin 1970 it had embarked on a comprehensive long-range program for\r\nraising agricultural productivity and output through the introduction of\r\nindustrial production methods on the farms. To that end the country's\r\nfarms were consolidated into 170 agroindustrial complexes intended to\r\nbring the advantages of scientific organization, concentration and\r\nspecialization of production, mechanization, and automation to all\r\nphases of agricultural work. Planning for these complexes has been\r\nconcentrated at the highest government level, and any modification of\r\nthe obligatory plans requires the approval of the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\nIn this process the traditional distinction between state and collective\r\nproperty has been blurred and is slated for gradual elimination; the\r\nsame is true for the differences in status of industrial and farm\r\nworkers. The new approach to farm organization was taken despite severe\r\nshortages of adequately trained management and technical personnel and\r\nin the face of the demonstrated superior productivity of tiny farm plots\r\ncultivated for their own benefit by individual farm and industrial\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at a comprehensive and balanced assessment of\r\nagricultural development and of the situation in the 1972/73\r\nagricultural year because of the continuing changes in the agricultural\r\nregime and the lack of essential data. All published information,\r\nincluding critical comments, emanates from controlled official sources.\r\nThe press output tends to concentrate on problem areas, treating other\r\naspects in uninformative generalities. Officials and press have been\r\nespecially silent on the question of the farmers' reactions to the new\r\nagricultural order, beyond claiming the farmers' whole-hearted support\r\nfor every new agricultural edict.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND SOILS\r\n\r\nNatural conditions are generally favorable for agriculture. Fertile\r\nsoils and a varied climate make possible the cultivation of a wide\r\nvariety of field crops, fruits, and vegetables, including warm-weather\r\ncrops, such as cotton, tobacco, rice, sesame, and grapes. Frequent\r\nsummer droughts, however, lead to wide fluctuations in crop yields and\r\nnecessitate extensive irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Stara Planina (literally, Old Mountain), or Balkan Mountains, divide\r\nthe country into several climatic and agricultural regions. The broad\r\nDanubian tableland that lies north of these mountains has a continental\r\nclimate, except for a narrow strip along the Black Sea coast. Cold\r\nwinter winds sweep across the plateau from the Eurasian land mass,\r\ncausing prolonged periods of frost, which tend to damage orchards and\r\nvineyards. There are 180 to 215 frost-free days in the year, and summers\r\nare hot. A continental climate also prevails in the Sofia Basin and in\r\nthe region surrounding the headwaters of the Struma River.\r\n\r\nIn the Thracian Plain, south of the Stara Planina, the continental\r\nclimate is modified somewhat by the influence of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nCompared to the Danubian plateau, winters are less severe, and summers\r\nare longer and warmer. The number of frost-free days per year ranges\r\nfrom 198 to 206. A near-Mediterranean climate prevails in the valleys of\r\nthe lower Struma, Mesta, and Maritsa rivers; in the Arda basin; and on\r\nthe southern slopes of the Rodopi (or Rhodope Mountains) (see ch. 3).\r\nThe mountains protect the inland valleys and basins from strong winds;\r\nsummers there are hot, and winters are mild. Yet winters are not mild\r\nenough for the cultivation of Mediterranean crops, such as olives and\r\ncitrus fruits.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea coast is warmer than the interior of the country in winter\r\nbut cooler in summer; from 241 to 260 days in the year are frost free.\r\nFrequent gale storms and hot winds resembling the African sirocco,\r\nhowever, have an adverse influence on crops.\r\n\r\nAlthough annual rainfall is reported to average about forty inches on\r\nthe higher mountain slopes and to reach seventy-five inches in the Rila\r\nmountain range, precipitation in most farming areas averages only twenty\r\nto twenty-five inches per year. Rainfall measures even less than twenty\r\ninches in the Plovdiv area and in the coastal districts of the Dobrudzha\r\nregion in the northeast. Most of the rainfall occurs in the summer\r\nmonths, but the amount and timing of precipitation are often unfavorable\r\nfor optimum crop growth. Drought conditions reached crisis proportions\r\nin 1958 and 1963 and were serious also in 1968. In 1972 most crops were\r\nadversely affected by a spring drought and excessive rains in the early\r\nfall; the grape crop was an almost total loss.\r\n\r\nSoils of superior and intermediate quality make up almost three-fourths\r\nof the country's surface. The Danubian plateau contains several grades\r\nof chernozem (black earth), which gradually give way to gray forest\r\nsoils in the foothills of the Stara Planina. A degraded chernozem called\r\n_smolnitsa_, or pitch soil, predominates in the Thracian Plain, the\r\nTundzha and Burgas lowlands, and the Sofia Basin. This central region is\r\nencircled at higher elevations by a belt of chestnut and brown forest\r\nsoils. Similar chestnut soils are also found in the Strandzha upland, in\r\nthe basins of the eastern Rodopi region, and in the Struma and Maritsa\r\nvalleys. Brown forest soils and mountain meadow soils occur in the Stara\r\nPlanina and in the Rila, Pirin, and western Rodopi. Alluvial soils,\r\noften of good quality, are found alongside the rivers, particularly the\r\nDanube and Maritsa, and also in several basins.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND USE\r\n\r\nIn 1970 agricultural land comprised almost 15 million acres, or 53\r\npercent of the country's land area. Sixty-nine percent of the\r\nagricultural land was suitable for field crops; 4 percent consisted of\r\nmeadows; and about 6 percent was devoted to vineyards, orchards, and\r\nother perennial crops. Natural pastures constituted more than 20 percent\r\nof the agricultural land. Bulgarian economists have repeatedly pointed\r\nout that the per capita acreage of farmland in the country, excluding\r\npastures, is among the lowest in the world.\r\n\r\nAccording to official statistics the area of agricultural land increased\r\nby 840,000 acres in the 1960s as a result of the expansion of grazing\r\nareas by 1.1 million acres and the simultaneous loss of 270,000 acres of\r\ncultivated land. The loss of cultivated acreage was caused by the\r\ndiversion of land to industrial and other uses and by severe soil\r\nerosion. The acreage devoted to vineyards and orchards nevertheless\r\nincreased by 100,000 acres, or 12 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Protection\r\n\r\nMore than half the cultivated acreage is subject to erosion.\r\nIncreasingly large areas degraded by erosion have remained uncultivated\r\neach year, but they continue to be included in the annual statistics on\r\nfarmland acreage. The unused area of plowland expanded from 720,000\r\nacres in 1960 to 1.26 million acres in 1970. Another 1.5 million to 2\r\nmillion acres have been reported to suffer from erosion to a degree that\r\nwill make it necessary to abandon them unless corrective measures are\r\nquickly taken. Only 70 percent of the acreage under fruit trees and\r\nvineyards bore fruit in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe government has long been aware of the need to arrest the loss of\r\ncultivated farmland. An intensive program of reforestation has been\r\ncarried on over many years, but the rate of replanting has not been high\r\nenough to halt the ravages of erosion. Proposals advanced by\r\nagricultural experts to clear abandoned mountain farmland of noxious\r\nweeds and to develop these areas into improved pastures--measures that\r\nwould also help control erosion--have not been acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1967 the continued loss of valuable farmland led to the promulgation\r\nof a special law for the preservation of land; details of this law are\r\nnot available. In 1972 the Council of Ministers issued an order,\r\neffective January 1, 1973, that provided, in part, for payments to be\r\nmade into a special land improvement fund in the event of diversion of\r\nfarmland for construction purposes. Depending upon the quality of the\r\nland, payments into the fund range from 162 leva (for the value of the\r\nlev--see Glossary) to 48,560 leva per acre. Land used for afforestation,\r\ncemeteries, and housing or public works under the jurisdiction of town\r\nauthorities is exempt from the payment requirement. The exemption also\r\napplies to land used for open pit mining on condition that the land is\r\nrehabilitated in accordance with plans and within time limits approved\r\nby the Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Industry (hereafter referred\r\nto as the Ministry of Agriculture).\r\n\r\nIn 1970 the government created special district councils for the\r\npreservation of cultivated land and, in May 1971, placed the councils\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture. The decree of\r\n1971 required the ministry and district governments to take decisive\r\nmeasures for the increased protection of farmland. The decree also\r\ndirected the chief prosecutor's office to increase control over the\r\nexpropriation of farmland for construction and other nonagricultural\r\npurposes and to impose severe penalties on violators of the land\r\nprotection law.\r\n\r\nThe land protection measures were not sufficiently effective. The\r\nacreage abandoned in the 1966-70 period was three times larger than the\r\narea abandoned in the preceding five years. In January 1973 an inspector\r\nof the Committee for State Control stated publicly that the farmland\r\nproblem had become increasingly more serious and that the committee was\r\nobliged to intervene in order to identify shortcomings in the land\r\npreservation work and to assist in eliminating the deficiencies. At the\r\nsame time the Council of Ministers reprimanded a deputy minister of\r\nagriculture and the heads of two district governments for grave\r\nshortcomings in the preservation and use of farmland.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to gain control over the deteriorating farmland situation,\r\na new land protection law that replaced the law of 1967 was passed in\r\nMarch 1973. The new law explicitly provided that only land unsuitable\r\nfor agricultural purposes or farmland of low productivity could be put\r\nto nonagricultural use. Under the law expansion of towns and villages\r\nwas to be allowed only after a specified density of construction had\r\nbeen reached. Construction of country homes and resort facilities was\r\nrestricted to land unsuitable for agriculture. Provision was made for\r\nregulations that would offer material and moral incentives to use\r\nunproductive land for construction purposes, and more severe penalties\r\nwere prescribed for violations that result in the waste of arable land.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigation\r\n\r\nSomewhat better results have been achieved in the expansion of\r\nirrigation. In the 1965-70 period the irrigable area increased at an\r\nannual average of 44,000 acres from 2.25 million to 2.47 million acres,\r\nor 21 percent of the cultivated land. Under the Sixth Five-Year Plan\r\n(1971-75) 494,000 acres are to be added to the irrigable area, raising\r\nthe total irrigable acreage to 26 percent of the cultivated land. During\r\nthe first two years of the plan period 124,000 acres were equipped for\r\nirrigation, and 80,000 acres were to be made irrigable in 1973. In order\r\nto complete the five-year irrigation program on schedule, therefore, it\r\nwould be necessary to bring under irrigation 270,000 acres in the last\r\ntwo years of the plan period--a task not likely to be accomplished in\r\nthe light of past experience and of available resources.\r\n\r\nOnly about 70 percent of the irrigable acreage was actually irrigated in\r\nthe 1965-70 period. Although the irrigated area of 1.7 million acres in\r\n1970 represented an increase of 21 percent of the acreage irrigated in\r\n1965, it was 17 percent smaller than the acreage irrigated in 1968.\r\n\r\nPrimitive gravity irrigation is practiced on about nine-tenths of the\r\nirrigated area. Water is distributed over the fields from unlined\r\nearthen canals by means of furrows dug with a hoe. The work entails hard\r\nmanual labor, and a single worker can handle only about 1.25 to 2.5\r\nacres per day. The timing of the water application and the quantity of\r\nwater used are not properly adjusted to the needs of the various crops,\r\nso that the increase in yields is only half as great as that obtained\r\nunder optimum conditions, and about half the water is wasted. The\r\nnetwork of irrigation ditches also impedes mechanical cultivation of the\r\nfields. Improper irrigation and drainage techniques have raised the\r\ngroundwater level excessively in several districts and have caused\r\nvarious degrees of soil salinization in areas totaling more than 39,000\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe five-year plan program for new irrigated areas calls for the\r\nconstruction of stationary sprinkler systems over 25,000 acres; 469,000\r\nacres are to be provided with portable sprinkler systems. Reconstruction\r\nand modernization of existing basic facilities are to be limited to the\r\nlining of canals. The ultimate longer term goal is to establish fully\r\nautomated stationary sprinkler systems in most irrigated districts. The\r\nmain problems in carrying out the irrigation program, in the view of an\r\nirrigation authority official, are posed by the paucity of investment\r\nfunds allotted for this purpose and the contradictory nature of some of\r\nthe program's aims. Additional difficulties are presented by the\r\nshortage of irrigation pipes and materials for their fabrication,\r\ninadequate experience in the manufacture of advanced irrigation\r\nequipment, and the lack of facilities for experimentation and testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCropping Pattern\r\n\r\nThe area of field crops amounted to almost 9 million acres in 1970; it\r\nhad declined by 887,000 acres after 1960. The proportions of this\r\nacreage devoted to the major types of crops were: grains, 62.5 percent;\r\nindustrial crops, 14.6 percent; feed crops, 18.7 percent; and\r\nvegetables, potatoes, and melons, 4.2 percent. In accord with the\r\ngovernment's policy of intensifying agricultural production, the acreage\r\nof bread grains had steadily declined, so that in 1970 it constituted\r\nsomewhat less than half the total grain acreage. The area of feed grains\r\nremained fairly stable; a decline in corn acreage was virtually balanced\r\nby an increase in the acreage of barley. A slight reduction also took\r\nplace in the acreage of pulses, but the area under rice expanded by 70\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nWhereas the total area of industrial crops changed very little in the\r\n1960-70 period, a significant shift took place in the relative size of\r\nthe individual crop areas. While the acreages of oilseeds and tobacco\r\nexpanded significantly, the acreages of fibers, particularly cotton, and\r\nof essential oils and medicinal plants declined sharply.\r\n\r\nThe area devoted to vegetables expanded by 20 percent. The tomato\r\nacreage expanded at about twice that rate and accounted for one-fourth\r\nof the vegetable acreage in 1970; tomatoes constitute an important\r\nexport crop. The potato acreage, on the other hand, declined by roughly\r\n20 percent during the period.\r\n\r\nThe area of fodder crops suffered a substantial decline, particularly in\r\nthe case of annual grasses and silage crops. The loss was only partially\r\noffset by the expansion of the perennial grass acreage.\r\n\r\nRapid expansion also took place in the areas of apple orchards and\r\nvineyards. The acreage of bearing apple trees increased by about 70\r\npercent in the 1970-70 period. During the same period the acreage of\r\nproducing vineyards grew by 24 percent, while the acreage of table\r\ngrapes increased by 2.3 times. Fruits and grapes are also important\r\nexport commodities. Expansion of the total acreage under fruit trees and\r\nberries, however, was much slower--17 percent in the 1960-68 period--and\r\na decline in the acreage set in after 1968. In the spring of 1973 Todor\r\nZhivkov, the communist party leader, called for decisive action to halt\r\nthe unfavorable trend. He reported that plans for orchard and berry\r\nplantings were not fulfilled in 1972; that from 27,000 to 40,000 acres\r\nof orchards had been uprooted over a period of a few years; and that the\r\nvineyard acreage had declined by 25,000 acres compared with the acreage\r\nin 1968. Reasons for these developments had not been made public.\r\n\r\nThe little information available on the subject suggests that price\r\nconsiderations have been the major reason for the crop acreage changes.\r\nThe price system and official regulations governing farm production have\r\nnot always operated in the manner planned by the government. Farms, for\r\ninstance, have steadfastly refused to enlarge the acreage of irrigated\r\ncorn to the extent demanded by the government, preferring to use\r\nirrigation for more profitable crops. In 1971 the farms failed to plant\r\nthe prescribed acreage of feed crops or to expand the production of\r\nvegetables. Public statements by the government on the reasons for these\r\nproblems have been most guarded. After a thorough review of the\r\nsituation in the spring of 1972, the Committee for State Control issued\r\na release that concluded by stating that the reasons for the problems\r\nwere analyzed in detail and that, after discussion, specific proposals\r\nwere made to the appropriate ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe organizational structure of agriculture in all its aspects is in a\r\nstate of transition, which will not be completed for several years. The\r\nreorganization was decided upon by the Central Committee of the BKP\r\n(Bulgarian Communist Party--see Glossary) in April 1970 on the\r\ninitiative of Zhivkov. The latest of several laws and decrees published\r\nin this context appeared in June 1972 with an effective date of January\r\n1, 1973. The new organizational policy represents a tightening of\r\ncentral controls over agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgroindustrial Complexes\r\n\r\nThe basic unit in the new organizational system, which is relied upon to\r\nrealize the leadership's agricultural policies, is the agroindustrial\r\ncomplex. The agroindustrial complex is an organization comprising\r\nseveral previously independent, contiguous collective and (or) state\r\nfarms having similar climatic and soil conditions. The complex may also\r\ninclude other organizations that are engaged in the production,\r\nprocessing, and distribution of farm products or in other activities\r\nrelated predominantly to agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1972 there were 170 agroindustrial complexes formed\r\nthrough the consolidation of 845 collective farms and 170 state farms;\r\nincluding the private plots of collective and state farmers, they\r\ncontained 92.5 percent of the cultivated land and accounted for 95.4\r\npercent of the farm output. Except for a few experimental units created\r\nin 1969, most agroindustrial complexes were established toward the end\r\nof 1970 and in early 1971. Only a small number of private farms located\r\nin difficult mountain areas remained outside the new system.\r\n\r\nThe average agroindustrial complex is composed of five or six farms\r\nhaving a cultivated area variously reported as 59,000 to 68,000 acres\r\nand a permanent work force of about 6,500 people. Although the large\r\nsize of the complexes has been questioned by several economists on\r\ngrounds of efficiency, Zhivkov was reported to have suggested the\r\npossibility of eventually merging the existing complexes into only\r\ntwenty-eight districtwide units.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes and Aims\r\n\r\nThe announced purpose of the reorganization is to increase productivity\r\nthrough concentration and specialization of agriculture on an industrial\r\nbasis in accord with the requirements of the current scientific and\r\ntechnical revolution and with the achieved level of maturity of the\r\ncountry's economy. The reorganization is intended to increase output,\r\nimprove quality, reduce costs, and increase the exportable surplus. It\r\nis also expected to bring about social improvement in the countryside by\r\nraising the farmworkers' incomes and helping to reduce the differences\r\nbetween town and country. Government officials intend to complete the\r\ntransition to the new organizational structure by 1980.\r\n\r\nThe original aim of the new farm policy in the late 1960s was to create\r\nlarge-scale regional organizations to handle all aspects of the\r\nproduction, processing, and distribution of foods and the supply of\r\nmachinery, fertilizers, and other farm needs through vertical\r\nintegration of the consolidated farm organizations with industrial and\r\ndistribution enterprises. This aspect of farm policy is to be realized\r\ngradually over a period of years. In the meantime vertical integration\r\nwill be based predominantly on contractual relations.\r\n\r\nA first step in vertical integration of agriculture and the food\r\nindustry was taken in December 1972 with the establishment of an\r\nagroindustrial trust called Bulgarian Sugar. Seven agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes were to be created around an equal number of sugar mills\r\ngrouped in the newly formed trust. The complexes were to average 100,000\r\nacres in size, one-fourth of which would be used each year for the\r\nproduction of sugar beets. The first such complex was established in\r\nRuse in January 1973. The crop rotation is to include wheat, corn, and\r\nfodder crops which, together with by-products from the sugar production,\r\nare to provide the feed base for livestock keeping. All farmlands in the\r\nnew organization are to become state property, and farmworkers are to\r\nacquire the status of industrial workers subject to the provisions of\r\nthe Labor Code.\r\n\r\nTwo basic types of agroindustrial complexes are provided for by the\r\nregulations. The first type is a membership organization in which the\r\nconstituent farms retain their juridical identity and a certain measure\r\nof economic independence. The second type is a centralized organization\r\nin which the constituent farms are merged and lose their separate\r\nidentities. A further distinction is made depending upon the nature of\r\nthe constituent farms and other economic organizations. Agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes composed only of collective farms and other collective\r\norganizations are called cooperative complexes. Those constituted by\r\nstate farms and other state economic organizations are known as state\r\ncomplexes. If both state and collective farms or other organizations\r\nare members, the complex is referred to as state-cooperative. The\r\ndistinctions have both legal and economic implications.\r\n\r\nIn early 1971 the form of the 139 agroindustrial complexes established\r\nup to that time was: collective, seventy-seven; state, seven; and\r\nstate-cooperative, fifty-five. Six complexes were created as centralized\r\norganizations in which the constituent farms lost their legal\r\nindependence. The largest of these complexes covered an area of 145,000\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal and Economic Aspects\r\n\r\nThe legal and economic aspects of the farm consolidation are extremely\r\ninvolved, and most of the problems raised by consolidation have not been\r\nworked out even theoretically. Activities of cooperative and\r\nstate-cooperative complexes are governed by the Provisional Regulation\r\nissued in October 1970 and by earlier regulations concerning collective\r\norganizations in matters not covered by the Provisional Regulation.\r\nState agroindustrial complexes are subject to the same regulations that\r\napply to all state economic associations (trusts). The Ministry of\r\nAgriculture was directed to prepare a draft statute for agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes by the end of 1972, which was to be submitted at an indefinite\r\nfuture date to the first agroindustrial complex conference for\r\ndiscussion and adoption.\r\n\r\nOfficial statements and documents have emphasized the voluntary and\r\ndemocratic nature of agroindustrial complexes. Zhivkov's report to the\r\nCentral Committee plenum stated that farms would be free to opt whether\r\nor not to join a complex and which complex to join if they decided to do\r\nso. They were also to have freedom of decision concerning the\r\nestablishment of joint enterprises. The plenum's decision used a broader\r\nformulation by referring only to voluntarism in the formation of\r\nagroindustrial complexes on the basis of mutual advantage. The\r\nProvisional Regulation contains a clause that permits farms and other\r\norganizations to withdraw from the agroindustrial complex at their own\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nOther provisions governing the establishment of agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes, however, conflicted with the principle of voluntarism. The\r\ncomposition, size, and production specialization of each complex was to\r\nhave a scientific foundation, and arbitrary decisions--as they were\r\ncalled--as to which farms to include in a particular complex were not to\r\nbe tolerated. The requirement of territorial unity also nullified the\r\nright of independent choice for most farms. Except for those located on\r\nthe borders of adjoining complexes, farms had perforce to join the\r\ncomplex formed in their area. The speed with which the agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes were formed throughout the entire country, with considerable\r\nloss of independence for the farms, also suggests that the voluntary\r\nnature of the complexes is a fiction. Available sources have contained\r\nno reference to any change in the affiliation of farms from one complex\r\nto another, let alone to the withdrawal of any farm from a complex. The\r\ndecree on the organization and management of agriculture that went into\r\neffect on January 1, 1973, contained no provision for a farm's\r\nwithdrawal from an agroindustrial complex.\r\n\r\nThe major tasks assigned to the agroindustrial complexes include: the\r\ncreation of large specialized units for the various types of\r\nagricultural production; the introduction of mechanized industrial\r\nmethods of production; the efficient application of human and material\r\nresources; and the equitable distribution of income to workers and\r\nmanagers in a manner that will provide an incentive for conscientious\r\nwork. Only preliminary official directives have been issued to guide the\r\nagroindustrial complexes in these matters. Economists, agricultural\r\nscientists, and officials have labored to develop a scientific basis for\r\nthe effective solution of the problems of transition.\r\n\r\nOne of the basic issues raised by the creation of agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes concerns the ownership of land in the new organizations,\r\nparticularly in complexes that unite collective and state farms.\r\nLegally, collective farm members retained ownership of the land they\r\ncontributed to the collective, although they have been unable to\r\nexercise any ownership rights. Until 1961 collective farm members\r\nreceived a rental payment for the land in the annual distribution of the\r\nfarm's income. There is an apparent official reluctance for political\r\nreasons abruptly to convert collective property to state ownership.\r\nPublic statements have indicated that the difference between collective\r\nand state property may be eliminated by transforming both into national\r\nproperty. Under the prevailing economic system the distinction between\r\nstate and national property is purely verbal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Farm Plots\r\n\r\nIn the current reorganization of agriculture there is no intention to\r\neliminate the time-honored institution of private subsidiary farm plots\r\nheld by collective farm members, state farm and industrial workers,\r\nartisans, and other individuals. In the 1965-70 period private plots\r\nconstituted only 10 percent of the farmland, yet in 1968 they accounted\r\nfor 22 percent of the crop output and 33 percent of the livestock\r\noutput. In 1970 the proportions of livestock products contributed by the\r\nprivate plots were: milk, 23 percent; meat and wool, 31 percent; eggs,\r\n50 percent; honey, 70 percent; and silk, 89 percent.\r\n\r\nDespite the support of private farm plots by the leadership, many local\r\nofficials consider them to be incompatible with the socialist system and\r\nplace various obstacles, often illegal, in the way of their operation.\r\nIn the directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan the party reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of private farm plots as a reserve for the increase of farm\r\noutput and particularly of livestock production. In a subsequently\r\npublished decree, which lifted restrictions on livestock rearing on\r\nprivate plots, the party and government again stressed that private\r\nplots will be an important source of products for their owners and for\r\nsale to the state.\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of private plots for collective farmers was\r\ndisclosed by income data published in the spring of 1973. In the 1960-70\r\nperiod the average annual income of permanently employed collective\r\nfarmers from private plots increased from 251 leva to 620 leva, while\r\nthe average remuneration for work performed on the collective property\r\nrose from 458 leva to 847 leva. Whereas the growth of income from\r\ncollective farm work amounted to 85 percent, income from private plots\r\nadvanced by 147 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNING AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nAgricultural planning has been highly centralized by the decree\r\neffective January 1, 1973. The system of planning has been made to\r\nconform to the system used for other sectors of the economy, with some\r\nallowances for the specific conditions of agricultural organization and\r\nproduction. Planning is to encompass long-range (ten to fifteen-years),\r\nfive-year, and annual plans that must be coordinated with a general plan\r\nfor regional development.\r\n\r\nPlanning in agriculture is to be based on the balancing of inputs and\r\noutputs and the use of government-determined long-range norms, limits,\r\nand indexes. Wide use is to be made of econometric models in the search\r\nfor optimal solutions. The norms, limits, and indexes are to be\r\nelaborated in direct relation to the natural and economic conditions of\r\nindividual agroindustrial complexes, crop varieties, kinds and breeds of\r\nlivestock, farm technology, and the availability of physical resources\r\nand manpower. The norms, limits, and indexes are to be of such a nature\r\nas to contribute to a continuous upgrading of agricultural efficiency,\r\nthat is, they will become increasingly more demanding as time\r\nprogresses. They are binding for planners and managers at all levels\r\nfrom the central government authorities down to the farm.\r\n\r\nIn essence the agricultural plan consists of state-imposed production\r\ntargets and estimates of resources to be allocated for their attainment,\r\ntogether with detailed directives for the use of the resources and for\r\nthe introduction of technological improvements. Responsibility for\r\nfulfilling the planned tasks rests upon the management of the\r\nagroindustrial complexes. The planned targets and conditions for their\r\nattainment are formulated for each individual complex by the State\r\nPlanning Committee together with the Ministry of Agriculture and the\r\nlocal district people's council; all plans are approved by the Council\r\nof Ministers.\r\n\r\nTen groups of norms, limits, and indexes enter into the formulation of\r\nplan targets. They specify progressive technical measures to be\r\nintroduced; the physical volume of each crop and livestock product to be\r\nsold to the state; the volume of capital investment and its specific\r\nuses; consumption norms for all materials, parts, and products in\r\naccordance with a list approved by the Council of Ministers; allowable\r\nexpenditures for each 100 leva of farm products and for labor\r\nremuneration per 100 leva of total income; norms for the formation of\r\nvarious operating and reserve funds and for material incentives; and\r\nlimits for the development of social amenities within the agroindustrial\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\nThe five-year plan tasks are broken down by years and may be changed\r\nonly in exceptional cases. The required changes may be made by the\r\nMinistry of Agriculture, with the approval of the State Planning\r\nCommittee, upon request made by the executive committee of the district\r\npeople's council. Whenever a specific change is introduced, all\r\nnecessary corrections must be made to maintain the overall balance of\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\nThe agroindustrial complexes must distribute the planned tasks handed to\r\nthem from above among their constituent units in accordance with\r\nstandards and conditions spelled out by the Ministry of Agriculture. The\r\ndistrict people's councils are required to take an active part in the\r\nprocess of coordinating the plan and in measures for its attainment\r\namong the units of the agroindustrial complex. On the basis of the state\r\nplan each agroindustrial complex and its constituent parts must prepare\r\nwhat has been called a counterplan, that is, a plan that sets higher\r\ngoals than those officially established.\r\n\r\nThe large size and diversified operations of the agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes place a heavy demand upon the expertise of management. Most of\r\nthe available specialists do not have the requisite training to solve\r\nthe numerous problems posed by planning and operational direction under\r\nthe new conditions. Adaptation of agricultural school curricula to the\r\nnew requirements and speedy retraining of specialists are therefore\r\nconsidered to be most urgent.\r\n\r\nSome optimistic agricultural officials place high hopes in the\r\nintroduction of computer-based automatic control systems. An electronic\r\ncomputer center was established at the Ministry of Agriculture in 1969,\r\nstaffed by a group of 104 enthusiastic young specialists. They undertook\r\nthe task of developing a single automated control system for agriculture\r\nand food production in the entire country by 1975, to be based on a\r\nnumber of integrated local and regional computer centers. By the end of\r\n1970 the computer center had worked out annual plans for several farms\r\nand a plan for hothouse production in the country. It was in the process\r\nof finding a solution to a basic problem of the feed industry--a\r\nsolution that would also drastically reduce the industry's\r\ntransportation costs.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has also been given to the problem of\r\ncommunication in connection with the internal direction of the\r\nagroindustrial complexes' varied activities. Here, too, the idea has\r\nbeen advanced for automated control centers from which instructions\r\nwould be issued to all operating divisions and workers in the field\r\nthrough radiotelephones or similar equipment. In this context a\r\nuniversity instructor analyzing the management problems of\r\nagroindustrial complexes remarked that it was premature to speak of\r\nmodern administrative and management methods as long as it was easier\r\nand faster to go by car from the farm center to any of the neighboring\r\nvillages than to reach them by telephone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR AND WAGES\r\n\r\nOfficial data on manpower and employment in agriculture are incomplete\r\nand incommensurate. The number of people gainfully employed in\r\nagriculture in 1970 was reported to have been 35.2 percent of the total\r\nin the economy, compared to 54.7 percent in 1960 and 44.9 percent in\r\n1965. Full-time employment on farms of the agroindustrial complexes in\r\n1970 was reported as 1,117,000 people--a reduction of 278,000 from the\r\n1,395,000 employed in 1965. Yet the number of female collective\r\nfarmworkers alone in 1969 was reported to have been 1,682,000, more than\r\n1 million of whom participated full or part time in the collective work\r\nof the farms. No explanation concerning the discrepancies in these\r\nreported figures was available. The Sixth Five-Year Plan is variously\r\nreported to call for the transfer of an additional 220,000 or 350,000\r\npeople from the farms to nonagricultural employment.\r\n\r\nThe out-migration, mostly of young people, from agriculture brought\r\nabout a deterioration in the age structure of the remaining farm\r\npopulation. The proportion of the sixteen- to twenty-five-year-old age\r\ngroup on farms was only 9.2 percent in 1969, compared to 22.3 percent in\r\nindustry. Conversely, the proportion of persons fifty-five years and\r\nolder was 29.1 percent in agriculture, compared to 8.6 percent in\r\nindustry. The program for the modernization and intensification of\r\nagricultural production and, more particularly, the planned high level\r\nof mechanization demand the employment of large numbers of highly\r\nskilled young people. A series of economic, social, and cultural\r\nmeasures is therefore urgently needed to halt the drain of young\r\nmanpower from the farms.\r\n\r\nBy 1971 the agricultural school system had not adapted its training\r\nprograms to the actual needs of the emerging agroindustrial complexes.\r\nAt the same time a serious problem in the employment of available\r\ntechnicians was presented by the scornful attitude of many farm managers\r\ntoward specialists with secondary education. In 1971 farms employed more\r\nthan 4,000 people without the requisite training in various professional\r\npositions. Although some of them may have compensated by experience for\r\nthe lack of training, the situation was considered deplorable by a\r\nnumber of agricultural economists.\r\n\r\nUnder previously prevailing conditions, payments to farmworkers differed\r\nwidely, depending upon the income levels of the individual farms. Under\r\nthe new law wages for all farmworkers are to be gradually standardized\r\non the principle of equal wages for equal work. Work input is to be\r\nmeasured on the basis of uniform labor norms differentiated according to\r\nnatural conditions. In determining the wage level, consideration will\r\nalso be given to increases in productivity, cost reduction, and the\r\naccumulation of investment funds by the farms. Distribution of the\r\nfarm's income is to be carried out on the basis of a resolution by the\r\nCouncil of Ministers, details of which were not available in early 1973.\r\nIts main import is that the total remuneration of farmworkers, over and\r\nabove their wages, will remain dependent upon the overall results of the\r\nindividual farms. All farmworkers are entitled to a minimum wage of 80\r\nleva per month, and members of previously independent collective farms\r\nretain their right to advance payments against their estimated final\r\nincome shares.\r\n\r\nLittle substantive information is available on the current practice of\r\nremunerating people working on farms. The decree that went into effect\r\non January 1, 1973, directed that the formation and distribution of\r\nincomes of all agroindustrial complexes and their constituent farms be\r\nbased on a uniform system and on the principle that each farm must be\r\nfully self-supporting. Each farm must establish a wage fund calculated\r\nas a percentage of its total income. In the event that this fund is\r\ninadequate to cover legitimate wage requirements, the farms may draw\r\nupon two other obligatory funds or resort to bank credits.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTMENT AND MECHANIZATION\r\n\r\nInvestment\r\n\r\nIn the 1960-71 period annual investment in agriculture increased from\r\n381 million to 548 million leva, but it declined as a proportion of\r\ntotal investment from 28 to 15 percent. A substantial portion of the\r\nagricultural investment was used to equip new state farms established on\r\npreviously collective farmlands. Investment funds were used for the\r\nconstruction of farm buildings, machinery repair stations, and\r\nirrigation facilities and for the acquisition of farm machinery. On the\r\nbasis of cultivated acreage, state farms received more investment than\r\ncollective farms, but the disproportion was gradually reduced and become\r\nquite small by 1970. In that year state farms had about 15 percent more\r\nfixed assets per acre of cultivated land than the collective farms.\r\n\r\nWith the formation of agricultural complexes discrimination in\r\ninvestment between the two types of farms is being eliminated along with\r\nother distinctions. Investment plans are to be uniformly based on the\r\nneeds of the entire complex regardless of the former status of its\r\nconstituent farms. Needs will be evaluated mainly on the basis of\r\ngovernment programs for individual kinds of production, the availability\r\nof manpower, and the natural conditions of the farms and complexes.\r\n\r\nAgricultural investment in the 1971-75 period was planned at about 2.7\r\nbillion leva. This sum constitutes only 13.5 percent of the total\r\nplanned investment and implies the maintenance of annual agricultural\r\ninvestment at the level of 1970. It also reflects the continued\r\nunderinvestment in agriculture in favor of industry, despite the\r\ngrandiose, plans for agricultural transformation, considering that\r\nagriculture contributed 22 percent of the national income in 1970. In\r\nthat year a Soviet economist observed that the small proportion of\r\nnational resources allotted to agriculture in the past was responsible\r\nfor the slow growth of that important economic sector and that the\r\nincrease in the mechanization of farms was not sufficient to offset the\r\nloss of manpower. The leadership's policy of placing agriculture on an\r\nindustrial footing and mechanizing production demands increased\r\ninvestment in machinery and other physical facilities. The low\r\ninvestment decreed for the 1971-75 period is not in keeping with that\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nA national conference on construction in agriculture, convened in the\r\nspring of 1972, was devoted to the study of shortcomings in capital\r\nconstruction. The underlying causes of unsatisfactory performance were\r\nanalyzed, and persons responsible for the failures were identified. The\r\nfindings of the conference were not published, but an account of the\r\nconference contained references to inadequate project planning, poor\r\ndesign, acceptance of inferior equipment, delays in the completion of\r\nconstruction, and cost overruns. A sympathetic foreign observer noted a\r\ndisproportionately large allocation of investment funds to building\r\nconstruction compared with the funds allotted for farm machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanization\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1971 Bulgarian agriculture possessed about 53,600\r\ntractors with a total of 1.4 million horsepower--the equivalent of about\r\nsixteen horsepower per 100 acres of plowed land. The horsepower of the\r\ntractor inventory increased by 2.3 times after 1960, but a portion of\r\nthat increase was offset by the loss of more than 358,000 horses and\r\nbuffalo. In 1970 Bulgaria had more tractor power per acre than any other\r\nEastern European communist country except Czechoslovakia and more horses\r\nper acre than any of these countries with the exception of Hungary,\r\nwhich had a slightly larger number.\r\n\r\nGrain combines on farms numbered 9,340, or 2.4 combines for each 1,000\r\nacres of grain crops. In this regard Bulgaria ranked above the Soviet\r\nUnion and at the average of the other Eastern European communist\r\ncountries. Nevertheless, according to the minister of agriculture, only\r\nabout 50 percent of the labor in wheat production was mechanized in\r\n1972, even though wheat production was considered to be the most highly\r\nmechanized branch of agriculture. In other production branches the level\r\nof mechanization was extremely low.\r\n\r\nAccording to scattered Bulgarian press reports the supply of farm\r\nmachinery is inadequate for the needs, unbalanced as to composition,\r\nand inferior in design and physical condition. Many of the available\r\ntractors and combines are overage and obsolete. The situation is\r\naggravated by chronic shortages of spare parts for both domestic and\r\nimported equipment. Production of parts is inhibited by its relatively\r\nlow profitability, despite incentives offered by the government.\r\n\r\nUnder the Sixth Five-Year Plan farm machinery valued at 780 million leva\r\nis to be delivered to agriculture from domestic sources and from the\r\nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON--see Glossary). This\r\nmachinery is to include more powerful tractors and grain combines,\r\nmilking machines, and sprinkler irrigation systems. Machinery is also to\r\nbe provided for the harvesting of corn, sugar beets, cotton, rice,\r\nfruits, and vegetables and for the harvesting and processing of feed\r\ncrops. Adequate information on the progress of the mechanization program\r\nduring the first two years of the five-year period is not available, but\r\nthere is evidence that shortages of spare parts and trained operators\r\ncontinued to immobilize substantial numbers of farm machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING\r\n\r\nThe marketing of farm products has been geared to the fixed five-year\r\nplan quotas for sales to the state. It is based on bilateral contracts\r\nbetween trusts in the food-processing industry and agroindustrial\r\ncomplexes or their constituent units. Contracts are concluded for a\r\nfive-year period and are broken down by years. They cover the entire\r\nfarm output specified in the counterplans at prices officially revised\r\non January 1, 1973. The price system includes bonuses for quality; these\r\nbonuses are payable only after a specified portion of the contracted\r\nquantity has been delivered and vary in relation to the total volume of\r\nproduct delivered. The intent of the bonuses is to stimulate product\r\nimprovement without encouraging production beyond the planned limits.\r\nExcess production would destroy the balance of the plan.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the marketing contracts were worked out by the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture and the State Arbitration Commission with the agreement of\r\nthe government departments involved. Provisions concerning the\r\nperformance of contractual obligations were strengthened compared with\r\nthose previously in force. They established financial incentives and\r\nsanctions not only for the contracting organizations but also for their\r\ntop managers as individuals, based upon the end results of their joint\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nEach food-processing trust engaged in the procurement of farm products\r\nmust establish a fund for the promotion of their production, for\r\nimproving farming methods, and for modernizing the farm's physical\r\nfacilities. The funds are to be used in the first place for stimulating\r\nthe output of products required on the domestic market and for export.\r\nThe allocation of promotional funds is to be in accord with a program\r\nworked out jointly by the trust and the agroindustrial complex; the\r\nprogram constitutes an integral part of the procurement contract.\r\n\r\nFarms, individual farmers, and private agricultural producers may sell\r\nsome of their products at retail directly to consumers in cooperative\r\nmarkets at prices not exceeding those charged by state retail stores. In\r\nsome instances and for some products sale on a commission basis through\r\nstate and cooperative outlets is also allowed. The sale of meat, meat\r\nproducts, and alcoholic beverages in cooperative markets is prohibited\r\nas is also the sale of any product through middlemen. Cooperative\r\nmarkets are subordinated to the trade organs of municipal authorities.\r\nViolations of applicable regulations are subject to penalties the\r\nseverity of which depends upon the nature of the offenses. Information\r\non the total volume of direct sales by agricultural producers is not\r\navailable. The share of collective farms in cooperative market sales,\r\nhowever, declined from 53 percent in 1959 to 16 percent in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION\r\n\r\nGrowth and Structure\r\n\r\nAs a result of continued emphasis on the country's industrialization,\r\nthe share of agriculture in national income (net material product) was\r\nonly 22 percent in 1970, compared to 31 percent ten years earlier.\r\nAccording to official sources, however, output continued to rise. It\r\nincreased at an average annual rate of 4.8 percent in the 1960-67\r\nperiod, declined by 10 percent in 1968, and regained the 1967 level in\r\n1970. An increase of 8 percent in the next two years raised the farm\r\noutput in 1972 to a level 50 percent above the output level in 1960. For\r\nthe entire period the average annual increase in farm output was 3.4\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nLivestock production was reported to have increased more rapidly than\r\ncrop production in the 1960-70 period; the respective average annual\r\nrates of growth in output were 4.1 and 2.9 percent. Crop output in 1970\r\nwas 33 percent larger than output in 1960, whereas livestock output was\r\n50 percent higher. Available data are inadequate to reconcile the\r\nreported growth in the value of livestock production with a seemingly\r\ninconsistent rise in the physical output of livestock products and\r\nchanges in livestock herds.\r\n\r\nThe structure of farm output in 1970 did not differ materially from the\r\nstructure in 1960. The share of crops in the total output declined from\r\n67.3 to 64.7 percent, while the share of livestock production rose\r\ncorrespondingly from 32.7 to 35.3 percent. The proportions of grains and\r\ntechnical crops were identical in both years. The share of vegetables,\r\npotatoes, and melons declined slightly, but the proportion of feed crops\r\ndropped from 9.2 to 6.2 percent. The lag in the growth rate of feed\r\nproduction has contributed to the difficulties in the livestock sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrops\r\n\r\nWith the exception of rye, potatoes, hemp, and cotton, output of all\r\nmajor crops increased substantially in the 1960s (see table 16). The\r\nproduction of rye declined sharply as a result of the diversion of rye\r\nacreage to the production of more valuable crops. By 1970 rye output had\r\nbecome insignificant--less than 1 percent of the volume of wheat\r\nproduced in that year. The decline in potato production was minor, but\r\nthe output of raw cotton declined by 15 percent. The largest increases\r\nwere attained in the production of alfalfa and table grapes--crops that\r\nare important for livestock production and export, respectively. Barley\r\noutput, important for livestock and beer production, rose by 82 percent.\r\nWheat output surpassed 3 million tons in 1970; it reached 3.56 million\r\ntons in 1972.\r\n\r\n_Table 16.

Cultivation of durum\r\nwheat has been almost completely abandoned because of its low yield. The\r\npossibility has been suggested, however, that production of durum may be\r\nresumed eventually on the basis of newly developed, more productive\r\nvarieties. Durum wheat requirements for the manufacture of noodles,\r\nsemolina, and other products have been imported against payment in\r\nforeign currencies.\r\n\r\nIncreases in the output and yields of crops were reported to have been\r\nachieved through the introduction of improved plant varieties and seeds,\r\nbetter cultivation practices, expanded irrigation, greater use of\r\nfertilizers, and more effective disease and pest control. The supply of\r\nfertilizers to agriculture, in terms of plant nutrients, increased from\r\nabout 49,000 tons in 1956 to 842,000 tons in 1968 but thereafter\r\ndeclined sharply to only 692,000 tons in 1969 and 635,000 tons in 1971.\r\nIn 1972 the fertilizer supply improved by a mere 10,000 tons. The bulk\r\nof the decline was in phosphates and potash, imports of which were\r\ndrastically curtailed after 1968, presumably because of the shortage of\r\nforeign exchange.\r\n\r\nThe supply of pesticides also depends very largely upon imports.\r\nDeliveries to agriculture rose from less than 10,000 tons in 1960 to\r\nalmost 12,900 tons in 1965, declined to 11,150 tons in 1969, and then\r\nsurpassed the 1965 supply by 300 tons in 1971. The need for a drastic\r\nincrease in the use of pesticides and fungicides is indicated by the\r\nofficial estimate that annual losses from crop diseases, pests, and\r\nweeds amount to from 150 to 200 million leva.\r\n\r\nDespite the progress made, agricultural technicians continue to call\r\nattention to the persistence of faulty practices in all phases of crop\r\nproduction--practices that tend to lower crop yields and retard\r\nagricultural growth. Traditionally a single variety of wheat has been\r\ngrown throughout the entire country, despite variations in soil and\r\nclimatic conditions. Although yields generally rose with the successive\r\nintroduction of better varieties, they remained low and of inferior\r\nquality in areas poorly adapted for the cultivation of a particular\r\nvariety. Specialists have stressed the need for diversification of\r\nvarieties, particularly under conditions of regionally defined\r\nagroindustrial complexes.\r\n\r\nA task force for scientific and technical aid to agriculture, formed by\r\nthe government at the end of 1965, uncovered the appearance and rapid\r\ndispersion of new grain diseases. Dry rot, which had assumed significant\r\nproportions in 1961, caused the most severe losses of wheat in 1970 and\r\n1971, when 1.2 million acres were affected by the disease, mainly in the\r\nnorthern grain-growing part of the country. Wheat flower blight, long\r\nknown in Bulgaria, became particularly widespread in 1965 after the\r\nintroduction of a new wheat variety highly susceptible to that disease.\r\nLosses from this source reached about 15 to 20 percent.\r\n\r\nPropagation of diseases has been aided by faulty cultivation practices.\r\nExcessively heavy seeding has been used increasingly to compensate for\r\ninadequate soil preparation. The resultant overly thick stands of grain\r\nare prone to lodging, which facilitates the spread of disease through\r\ngreater contact of the wheatstalks. The tendency to lodging and, thus,\r\nto the spreading of disease is also encouraged by the improper use of\r\nfertilizers. To compensate for the shortage of phosphatic fertilizers an\r\nerroneous practice has developed of increasing the application of\r\nnitrogenous fertilizers, thereby upsetting the proper balance of plant\r\nnutrients. The resultant excessive vegetative growth weakens the grain\r\nstalks and induces lodging of the grain. Lodging also causes heavy\r\nlosses through the germination of kernels and through major difficulties\r\nin harvesting.\r\n\r\nDamage to wheat and barley crops from improper use of phosphatic\r\nfertilizers has also been reported. Substantial losses have been\r\nincurred in the production of sunflower seeds through inexpert use of\r\nfertilizers and insecticides, inadequate thinning and weeding, improper\r\ncrop rotation, and poor harvesting methods. The basic underlying cause\r\nof these difficulties is the widespread lack of familiarity with modern\r\nproduction methods and the inadequate supply of technically trained\r\npersonnel to guide farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLivestock and Livestock Products\r\n\r\nDespite repeated government decrees concerning measures for raising\r\nlivestock production, including various incentives, no significant\r\nsuccess was attained in increasing livestock herds in the period 1961 to\r\nJanuary 1971 (see table 17). The numbers of cattle, hogs, and rabbits\r\nactually declined; the flocks of sheep grew by less than 4 percent; and\r\nonly the numbers of goats and poultry increased substantially. An\r\nincrease in all categories of livestock other than sheep, however, took\r\nplace in 1971. In comparison with 1948 the total number of cattle in\r\n1971 was lower by 28 percent, and the number of cows had declined by 16\r\npercent. The poor performance of the livestock sector, particularly with\r\nregard to cattle, has been a source of great concern for the leadership\r\nbecause of the leadership's promise of a better standard of living for\r\nthe population and the obligation to meet export commitments to COMECON\r\npartners, particularly the Soviet Union. Exports of livestock are also\r\nimportant as a source of convertible foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n_Table 17.

In 1971 these groups\r\npossessed virtually all the goats and rabbits, more than half the\r\npoultry, and about two-fifths of the sheep. They also owned 27 percent\r\nof the hogs and 22 percent of the cattle, including 30 percent of the\r\ncows. On socialized farms all types of livestock were reduced in numbers\r\nduring the 1961-70 period except for cows and poultry. Among private\r\nowners the decline in the numbers of cattle and hogs was more\r\npronounced, but substantial gains were made in the stock of sheep,\r\ngoats, and poultry. Government policies concerning prices, incentives,\r\nand feed allocation were mainly responsible for the differences in\r\ndevelopment within the socialized and private sectors.\r\n\r\nExpansion of livestock herds and production has been hampered by an\r\ninadequate feed supply. The feed shortage in the 1966-70 period was\r\nestimated by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences to have approximated 30\r\npercent. Domestically produced feed concentrates have been of poor\r\nquality and nutritionally unbalanced. In 1972 more than 45 percent of\r\nthe mixed feeds and concentrates were substandard, and requirements for\r\nthese feeds were met by less than 55 percent.\r\n\r\nThe production of feed crops increased in absolute terms during the\r\n1960-70 period, but its rate of growth lagged by comparison with other\r\ncrops and with official plans. In 1971 and 1972 the alfalfa acreage was\r\nsupposed to be 990,000 acres, but only 840,000 acres were actually\r\ncropped. In 1972 only 57 percent of the requirements for alfalfa and\r\nmeadow hay were met on farms of the agroindustrial complexes, and the\r\nquality of the hay was extremely low. The inadequacy of the feed supply\r\nin relation to the government's livestock program has been designated by\r\nthe leadership as one of the most crucial problems of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the 1971-75 period improvement in the feed supply is to be achieved\r\nmainly through an increase in feed crop yields, but a certain increase\r\nin acreage has also been planned. Results in the first two years of the\r\nfive-year period have jeopardized the attainment of the goal for 1975.\r\nSubstantial investment funds are to be provided for the modernization of\r\ndairy barns and for the construction of feed mills with assistance from\r\nthe Soviet Union. With a view to raising productivity and output,\r\nlivestock production is to be increasingly concentrated on large\r\nspecialized farms. This policy ignored the demonstrated superiority of\r\nlivestock production on small farm plots.\r\n\r\nMajor problems in the expansion of cattle herds and livestock production\r\nare also posed by poor management and inadequate veterinary services.\r\nThe reproduction rate of cattle is abnormally low because of the high\r\npercentage of old, sterile cows in the herds. The incidence of diseases\r\nof the reproductive system and of mastitis among cows is rapidly\r\nincreasing, and mortality among cattle is high. Young breeding stock is\r\nreared in unsuitable surroundings, is ill fed, and consequently remains\r\nunderdeveloped. A large proportion of newly born calves succumb to\r\nvarious diseases. There is a shortage of trained veterinarians, but\r\nveterinarians stationed on farms and in district veterinary hospitals\r\nare reported to feel no responsibility for the deplorable conditions.\r\nThe care of livestock also suffers from a lack of adequately trained\r\nworkers and a high labor turnover in the livestock sections of the\r\nagroindustrial complexes. Managers and specialists at the higher levels\r\nof the agroindustrial complexes fail to provide systematic supervision\r\nand guidance and often exhibit a lack of interest in the livestock\r\nenterprise. These conditions were reported to the General Assembly by a\r\ndeputy minister of agriculture.\r\n\r\nDespite the shortage of feed, increased yields per animal were attained\r\nin the 1960-71 period. For agriculture as a whole the output of milk per\r\ncow rose from 1,482 to 2,281 quarts, the number of eggs per hen\r\nincreased from ninety-one to 115, and the amount of wool per sheep rose\r\nfrom 5.3 to 7.4 pounds. In 1972, however, yields per cow and per hen\r\ndeclined. In the socialized sector the decline in milk yield had begun\r\nin 1968 and reached serious proportions in 1972; the egg yield remained\r\nstable through 1970 (data for later years were not available in 1973).\r\nIn the private sector the milk yield continued to rise at least until\r\n1970; the egg yield remained stable through 1969 and rose in 1970. In\r\nthe spring of 1973 several agricultural officials, including a deputy\r\nminister of agriculture, were reprimanded by the Council of Ministers\r\nBureau for permitting the decline in yields of milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nA study of milk production during the 1965-67 period found that farms\r\nhaving milk yields of 2,110 to 2,640 quarts per cow sustained an annual\r\nloss of 56 leva for each animal, whereas farms with yields of 3,170 to\r\n4,287 quarts earned a net income of 111 leva per cow. The reported\r\nnational average milk yield per cow therefore indicates that most farms\r\nproduced milk at a loss.\r\n\r\nThe officially reported meat output increased by 74 percent in the\r\n1960-68 period but declined by 11 percent in the next two years. By far\r\nthe largest increase in production to 1968--2.9 times--was reported for\r\nbeef and veal, while production of poultry meat and of sheep, and goat\r\nmeat almost doubled (see table 18). The decline in output after 1968\r\naffected all types of meat except for poultry and rabbits. For the\r\nentire period of 1960 through 1970, meat output rose by 55 percent,\r\nincluding production increases of 150 percent for beef and veal, 160\r\npercent for poultry, and 82 percent for sheep and goat meat. Pork\r\nproduction, however, had risen by only 10 percent, and the output of\r\nrabbit meat declined by about one-third. The reported increase in meat\r\nproduction cannot be correlated with available data on changes in the\r\nsize of livestock herds. An improvement in the supply of all types of\r\nmeat other than beef and veal took place in 1971.\r\n\r\nProduction of milk and eggs also increased substantially during the\r\n1960-71 period (see table 19). Nevertheless, domestic market supplies of\r\nlivestock products remained chronically and seriously short of demand,\r\nin part because of the magnitude of exports. Exports of agricultural raw\r\nmaterials and processed foods exceeded 1 billion leva in 1970; they had\r\nincreased 2.7 times during the decade and were equivalent to 44 percent\r\nof agriculture's contribution to the national income. Exports of food\r\nproducts alone had increased more than 3.5 times during the decade to a\r\ntotal of 732 million leva.\r\n\r\n_Table 18.

Industrial expansion was being\r\nincreasingly restrained by the inadequacy of domestic raw material and\r\nskilled labor resources. Limits on an increase in imports of materials\r\nand essential machinery were placed by the insufficiency of foreign\r\nexchange reserve and by the need to reduce traditional exports of\r\nconsumer goods in short supply on the domestic market. The Soviet Union\r\ncontinued to be the predominant supplier of raw materials, machinery,\r\nand technical and technological assistance.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the limitations on industrial expansion, the leadership of\r\nthe Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary) and government sought\r\nto raise industrial productivity through concentration and\r\nspecialization of production and through improvements in the management\r\nof material and labor resources. Strong emphasis was placed on the\r\nintroduction of automation in both production and management processes.\r\nHeavy stress was also laid on the need to raise the quality of\r\nindustrial products in order to increase their salability abroad and\r\ntheir acceptance in the domestic market.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of industrial enterprises into a limited number of\r\ntrusts, introduced in 1971 as a measure for increased centralized\r\ncontrol in the search for greater efficiency, was being carried forward\r\nby means of further regulatory and clarifying edicts. The leadership's\r\nultimate goal of an efficiently managed, technologically advanced,\r\nlow-cost industry remained the driving force behind all industrial\r\npolicy decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nVirtually all industry is state owned. In 1970 state enterprises\r\npossessed 98.6 percent of all industrial assets; they employed 88.8\r\npercent of the industrial work force and produced 89.7 percent of the\r\nindustrial output. Collective industrial enterprises owned the balance\r\nof 1.4 percent of the assets, employed 11.2 percent of the workers, and\r\ncontributed 9.9 percent of the industrial output. Small private\r\nenterprises, mostly artisan shops, accounted for only 0.4 percent of the\r\nindustrial output.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nSize and Location\r\n\r\nIn 1970 the industrial establishment (excluding the private sector,\r\ninformation on which is not available) consisted of 1,827 state\r\nenterprises and 644 collective enterprises, employing about 1.02 million\r\nand 129,000 people, respectively. More than one-half of the enterprises\r\nin the state industry employed over 200 people, and almost one-fourth\r\nemployed more than 1,000 people. Enterprises with large numbers of\r\nworkers predominated in metallurgy; in the glass and china industry; in\r\nclothing manufacture; and in the leather, shoe, and fur industry.\r\nBeginning in 1971 previously independent enterprises were transformed\r\ninto branches of countrywide trusts organized along functional lines\r\n(see ch. 12).\r\n\r\nThe territorial distribution of industry during the 1950-70 period was\r\ndetermined in large part by the priority development of heavy industry,\r\nthe location of which was dictated mainly by the sites of raw material\r\nsources and the location of major consuming centers. In this process\r\nseveral cities and districts, including Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas,\r\nand Ruse, experienced a large population influx from rural areas and\r\nattendant shortages of housing and public services. At the same time\r\nmany villages were deprived of their inhabitants, and homes and public\r\nfacilities were abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 the Central Committee of the BKP laid down guidelines for a\r\nprogram of regional economic development, with a view to attaining an\r\noptimal distribution of productive resources (capital and labor). The\r\naim of the program was to arrest excessive urban growth and the\r\nassociated demands on the country's resources for new housing and other\r\namenities and, at the same time, to help develop backward rural areas.\r\nWithin these guidelines, decentralization of industry has been\r\nundertaken, and plans are being worked out for the socioeconomic\r\ndevelopment of individual districts under the Seventh Five-Year Plan\r\n(1976-80) and until 1990.\r\n\r\nIn this context the construction of new industrial plants in heavily\r\npopulated areas has been restricted. Further production increases in\r\nthese areas are to be attained through modernization of existing\r\nfacilities and the introduction of more advanced technology. Special\r\nmeasures have also been adopted to promote economic growth in the\r\nrelatively underdeveloped districts. In part, this program is\r\nimplemented through the transfer of industrial activities, equipment,\r\nand labor from the congested cities and districts to rural areas.\r\nTransfers of this kind decreed by the Council of Ministers Bureau in\r\nDecember 1971 and July 1972 involved 195 production units and 25,000\r\nworkers and an annual output of 225 million leva (for value of the\r\nlev--see Glossary). Under existing plans lasting until 1975, however,\r\nindustry and employment will continue to expand in some of the most\r\nheavily congested cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupply System\r\n\r\nThe organization of a smoothly functioning materials and equipment\r\nsupply system for industry has been an elusive goal of the leadership\r\never since the inception of the controlled economy. Various approaches\r\nto the problem over a period of years have not succeeded in\r\naccomplishing the basic task of ensuring a dependable supply of material\r\nresources to industrial producers. As a result, the economy has been\r\nofficially reported to suffer enormous losses through production\r\nshutdowns, substitutions of materials that lower quality and increase\r\ncosts, and hoarding of scarce materials. Heavy losses have also been\r\nincurred through improper storage of materials, careless use that\r\nentails excessive waste, and pilferage.\r\n\r\nAdequate information on the organization and functioning of the\r\nindustrial supply system has not been available. The latest\r\nreorganization of the supply system was undertaken at the end of 1971\r\nwith a view to providing a normal flow of supplies for the economic\r\ntrusts beginning in 1972. Until 1971 the supply organizations had dealt\r\nalmost entirely with individual enterprises. The reorganization was\r\naccompanied by extensive consultations with producers of raw materials,\r\nimporting organizations, and industrial consumers. The consultations\r\nwere held in order to clarify the needs of consumers, ensure the\r\navailability of the needed supplies, and agree upon specific measures\r\nfor timely deliveries of materials and supplies.\r\n\r\nParticular attention in the reorganization was paid to the problem of\r\nreducing the inventories of materials in enterprises and concentrating\r\nthem in the supply organizations. Decisive measures were taken to halt\r\nthe former practice of making deliveries of materials large enough to\r\ncover requirements for three months or longer. Under the new system,\r\nsupply organizations are required to make periodic deliveries to\r\nconsumers on guaranteed time schedules, at short intervals, and in\r\nquantities that do not exceed one month's requirements. Adherence to the\r\nregulation is to be used as a standard in evaluating the performance of\r\nsupply organizations.\r\n\r\nOne of the basic elements in industrial consumer-supplier relations has\r\nbeen the annual contract for estimated material and equipment\r\nrequirements needed to complete the annual production quota. For a\r\nvariety of reasons both suppliers and users have often failed to honor\r\nthese contracts, and the penalties provided for breach of contract have\r\nnot been sufficient to deter this practice. Breaches of supply contracts\r\nhave been an important cause of economic difficulties. Supply\r\ndifficulties have been particularly disruptive because of the\r\ntraditionally stringent nature of the production plans and the limited\r\navailability of resources.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 the Ministry of Supply and State Reserves planned to take\r\nenergetic measures to strengthen contract discipline and to use\r\ncontracts as legal and economic instruments for exerting pressure on\r\nboth parties to fulfill their obligations. The minister considered it\r\nparticularly important to put an end to the practice of contract\r\ncancellation, either under provisions of official regulations or by\r\nmutual agreement of the parties concerned--a practice that, according to\r\nthe minister, caused huge losses to the national economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nStructure\r\n\r\nManufacturing is the dominant sector of industry in terms of employment\r\nand output. In 1971 manufacturing accounted for 93.9 percent of the\r\ntotal industrial output and provided employment to 88.3 percent of the\r\nindustrial labor force. Mining and energy production contributed 3.6 and\r\n2.5 percent, respectively, of the industrial output and employed 10.3\r\nand 1.4 percent, respectively, of the labor force. More than half the\r\nindustrial establishment was devoted to the production of capital goods.\r\nIn 1971 the capital goods sector employed 52.5 percent of the industrial\r\nlabor force and produced 56 percent of the output. The relative\r\nimportance of the capital goods sector had been rising over a period of\r\nyears, from 36.7 percent of the output in 1948 and 47.2 percent in 1960.\r\nDuring the same period the contribution of the consumer goods sector to\r\ntotal output had declined from 63.3 percent in 1948 to 52.8 percent in\r\n1960 and 44 percent in 1971. As a consequence of the priority\r\ndevelopment of heavy industry, the supply of consumer goods on the\r\ndomestic market has been inadequate to meet consumer needs (see ch. 5).\r\n\r\nIn terms of their employment shares, the largest state industry branches\r\nin 1971 were: machine building and metalworking, 25.5 percent; food\r\nprocessing, 14.4 percent; and textiles, 11.3 percent. Next in\r\nimportance, but with much lower levels of employment, were: timber and\r\nwoodworking, 7.4 percent; chemicals and rubber, 6.1 percent; and fuels,\r\n5.5 percent. Industrial branches that experienced the most rapid growth\r\nin the 1960-71 period included ferrous metallurgy, chemicals and rubber,\r\nmachine building and metalworking, and fuels. Among the slowest growing\r\nbranches were timber and wood processing, textiles, nonferrous\r\nmetallurgy, and food processing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUELS AND POWER\r\n\r\nDomestic resources of mineral fuels are inadequate for the needs of\r\nindustry. Through the limitation that it places on electric power\r\ndevelopment, the fuel shortage--in the absence of a large hydroelectric\r\npower potential--may become a major factor inhibiting industrial growth.\r\nIn 1968 the proportion of petroleum and natural gas in the fuel balance\r\nwas somewhat more than 42 percent; it is planned to rise to about 60\r\npercent in 1975 and to at least 65 percent in 1980. Virtually all\r\npetroleum and natural gas must be imported.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal and Lignite\r\n\r\nReserves of anthracite and bituminous coal are insignificant; their\r\nproduction amounts to less than 2 percent of the annual coal output.\r\nBrown coal deposits that can be mined economically are nearing\r\nexhaustion, and brown coal production declined by about one-third in the\r\n1960-70 period. Low-calorie lignite remains the major fuel base for\r\nthermoelectric power stations. Reserves of this inferior fuel are large.\r\n\r\nCoal deposits are scattered in about twenty small deposits. Because of\r\ndifficult geological conditions, however, only a few of the deposits are\r\nexploited. Anthracite is mined in the Svoge basin, located in the Iskur\r\ngorge area of the Stara Planina, north of Sofia. Bituminous coal is\r\nmined in the same mountain range, in the area between Gabrovo and\r\nSliven. The deposit at Sliven was reported to contain a very small\r\nquantity of coking-grade coal--a quantity far below the needs of the\r\niron and steel industry. In addition to large annual imports of coking\r\ncoal, Bulgaria has also imported from 250,000 to 465,000 tons of coke\r\nper year.\r\n\r\nThe main source of brown coal for many years has been the Pernik basin\r\nin the upper Struma valley, about nineteen miles southwest of Sofia. In\r\nthe 1971-75 period brown coal mining is to be substantially expanded at\r\nthe Bobov Dol deposit in the Rila mountain range, south of the Pernik\r\nbasin. The Babino mine in the Bobov Dol coalfield is scheduled to become\r\nthe largest underground coal mine in the Balkans. Reserves in this\r\ndeposit, however, are equivalent to only about five to six years'\r\nproduction at the 1970 rate of brown coal output.\r\n\r\nLignite is mined mainly in the Maritsa basin, near Dimitrovgrad in the\r\nThracian Plain, and in the Sofia Basin. The Maritsa basin, particularly\r\nthe area known as Maritsa-Iztok (Maritsa-East), has become the basic\r\nsource of coal production, contributing about 50 percent of the\r\ncountry's output. Aside from planned new mine construction, the\r\nMaritsa-Iztok complex is to be rebuilt and modernized. Production\r\nproblems at this mine have not yet been solved satisfactorily.\r\nCoal-bearing strata have not been fully identified; equipment is\r\nutilized to only about 40 percent of capacity; and the organization of\r\nlabor is poor. Substantial improvement also remains to be attained in\r\nprocessing the coal for market, in view of its high ash and moisture\r\ncontent. Unsolved problems also remain in the manufacture of coal\r\nbriquettes.\r\n\r\nIn the 1971-75 period substantial investment is to be devoted to the\r\nexpansion and modernization of coal mines. New mines with an annual\r\ncapacity of about 4 million tons are to be built. Three-fourths of the\r\ninvestment funds are to be concentrated on three major production\r\ncenters. The relative investment shares of these centers were planned to\r\nbe: Maritsa-Iztok complex, 41 percent; Bobov Dol complex, 25 percent;\r\nand the Georgi Dimitrov mine at Pernik, 10 percent.\r\n\r\nProduction of marketable coal increased by 83 percent in the 1960-70\r\nperiod to a level of about 29 million tons. The rise in output, however,\r\nwas confined to lignite production, which grew more than fourfold during\r\nthe decade. Production of bituminous and brown coal declined by 42 and\r\n32 percent, respectively. Output of anthracite in 1970 equaled the\r\noutput in 1960 but was 9 percent below the production level in 1966.\r\nProduction of both anthracite and bituminous coal amounted to less than\r\n400,000 tons in 1970. Strip mining has steadily grown in importance and\r\naccounted for 73 percent of the output in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) calls for a rise in coal output to 33\r\nmillion tons--an increase of about 13 percent. In the view of the\r\nminister of heavy industry, the planned increase is not large, but its\r\nattainment is difficult considering the character and condition of the\r\nmines. Experience has justified the minister's assessment. In the first\r\ntwo years of the five-year period, coal output rose by less than 1\r\npercent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas\r\n\r\nDeposits of crude oil are located at Tyulenovo in the Dobrudzha region\r\nand at Dolni Dubnik, east of Pleven. Natural gas fields have been\r\ndiscovered near Vratsa and in the area of Lovech, south of Pleven.\r\nReliable information on the magnitude of crude oil and natural gas\r\nreserves is not available. Statistics on current imports and official\r\nprojections of import requirements, however, indicate that domestic\r\nproduction of oil and natural gas will continue to cover only a small\r\nfraction of needs.\r\n\r\nProduction of crude oil rose from 200,000 tons in 1960 to 500,000 tons\r\nin 1967 but declined thereafter to 305,000 tons in 1971. Natural gas\r\noutput, which had increased to 18.5 billion cubic feet in 1969, declined\r\nto 16.7 billion cubic feet in 1970 and 11.6 billion cubic feet in 1971.\r\nImports of crude oil, mostly from the Soviet Union, increased almost\r\n3-½ times between 1965 and 1971 to a level of 7.5 million tons. In\r\n1972 the Soviet Union alone provided 95 percent of the country's\r\nrequirements for crude oil and petroleum products. Imports of natural\r\ngas from the Soviet Union, through a pipeline still under construction,\r\nare scheduled to begin in 1974 at a level of 35 billion cubic feet and\r\nto continue at an annual rate of 106 billion cubic feet beginning in\r\n1975. The planned 1975 import volume represents about three-fourths of\r\nthe estimated requirements in that year.\r\n\r\nCrude oil is processed in two refineries, located at Burgas and Pleven,\r\nwith daily throughput capacities of about 16,500 tons and 5,500 tons,\r\nrespectively. Except for the small domestic output, crude oil for the\r\nPleven refinery is moved by rail from Black Sea ports. A pipeline\r\nnetwork that will connect the refinery with the ports is under\r\nconstruction and is scheduled to enter into full operation in 1975. By\r\nthat date the capacity of the Pleven refinery is planned to attain\r\n16,500 tons per day. A pipeline under construction for the transport of\r\npetroleum products from the Burgas refinery to consuming centers at\r\nStara Zagora and Plovdiv is to be completed sometime in 1973.\r\n\r\nThe refinery output has not been sufficient to cover all the country's\r\nrequirements for petroleum products. Net imports of petroleum products\r\nin 1970, including gasoline, fuel oils, and lubricating oils, amounted\r\nto 2.5 million tons. Ninety percent of the imports originated in the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrical Energy\r\n\r\nInstalled electric generating capacity and production of electrical\r\nenergy increased more than fourfold in the 1960-71 period but failed to\r\nkeep pace with the country's growing requirements. Installed capacity in\r\n1971 was 4.48 million kilowatts, including 3.65 million kilowatts in\r\nthermal and 0.83 million kilowatts in hydroelectric stations. During the\r\nperiod the proportion of hydroelectric capacity declined from 50 to 18\r\npercent, and the production of electricity per kilowatt of hydroelectric\r\ncapacity dropped by more than one-third. The utilization of thermal\r\ncapacity declined by 13.5 percent.\r\n\r\nNew power from generating plants scheduled to begin operation in the\r\n1971-75 period totals about 3 million kilowatts. Major power stations to\r\nbe commissioned include: hydroelectric stations--with a capacity of 1\r\nmillion kilowatts--on the Sestrimo cascade, in the upper reaches of the\r\nMaritsa River and at the Vucha cascade, southwest of Plovdiv; a thermal\r\npower plant with a capacity of about 620,000 kilowatts at Bobov Dol,\r\nfueled by local coal; and an atomic power station with a capacity of\r\n880,000 kilowatts at Kozloduy on the Danube River, in the northwestern\r\ncorner of the country. According to government plans, total generating\r\ncapacity is scheduled to reach 7 million kilowatts in 1975 and 12\r\nmillion kilowatts in 1980. The more distant plans include the\r\nconstruction, jointly with Romania, of a hydroelectric power complex on\r\nthe Danube, at Belene on the Bulgarian bank of the river and Ciora on\r\nthe Romanian side. The Soviet Union has provided large-scale technical\r\nand material assistance in the development of the electric power system.\r\n\r\nProduction of electrical energy amounted to 21 billion kilowatt-hours in\r\n1971, of which 90 percent was generated by thermal stations. Energy\r\noutput in 1972 reached 22.3 billion kilowatt-hours. The Sixth Five-Year\r\nPlan calls for an energy output of 30.5 billion kilowatt-hours in 1975,\r\nwhich is equivalent to an average annual increase in output of 9.4\r\npercent during the five-year period. In the years 1971 and 1972 energy\r\noutput rose by an average of 6.9 percent per year, so that an average\r\nannual rise of 11 percent will be needed in the remaining years to\r\nattain the planned goal in 1975. Consumption of electrical energy in\r\n1975 is planned to reach 33.5 billion kilowatt-hours. The planned\r\ndeficit of 3 billion kilowatt-hours is to be covered by imports from\r\nRomania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe electrical transmission network is well developed, and further major\r\nimprovements have been planned. The network is connected with the power\r\ngrids of Romania and Yugoslavia. A 400-kilovolt power line from the\r\nMoldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union was reported to\r\nhave been completed in mid-1972. There was no evidence nine months later\r\nthat power had actually been transmitted over that line.\r\n\r\nEighteen percent of the total electrical energy supply in 1971 was used\r\nby the power stations or lost in transmission. Of the remaining net\r\nsupply, almost 70 percent was consumed in industry and construction;\r\nagriculture received only 4 percent; and transport and communications\r\naccounted for little more than 3 percent. Households were allotted about\r\n16 percent of the net electrical supply, and the balance of 7 percent\r\nwas consumed in trade, public institutions, and street lighting. The\r\nmajor industrial users of energy were metallurgical enterprises and the\r\nproducers of chemicals and rubber; each of these industrial branches\r\nconsumed one-fifth of the energy supply to industry.\r\n\r\nExpansion of electric-generating capacity and energy output at rates\r\nplanned by the government has been hampered by a chronic lag in new\r\nconstruction and by inadequate maintenance of existing facilities. The\r\nlack of preventive maintenance and disregard of technical requirements\r\nin the operation of equipment result in frequent breakdowns requiring\r\nmajor repairs. Such repairs, particularly those involving boilers,\r\nturbines, and transformers, pose difficult problems because of the\r\nshortage of technically qualified repair personnel and ineffective\r\norganization of repair work. Efficiency of operation is also adversely\r\naffected by a high labor turnover and the difficulty of finding\r\nqualified replacements.\r\n\r\nThe lag in the completion of new power stations, equipment breakdowns,\r\nand insufficient water reserves for hydroelectric stations have caused\r\nfrequent power shortages, particularly at peak load hours. Elaborate\r\nofficial measures have been introduced to regulate the consumption of\r\nelectricity and to eliminate waste, including a bonus system for saving\r\nelectricity. These measures have not proved sufficiently effective, and\r\nsome enterprises have been reported to earn bonuses by the simple\r\nexpedient of overstating their requirements in the formulation of the\r\nannual economic plans. The State Inspectorate for Industrial Power and\r\nPower Control, it was stated by officials, was not in a position to\r\nsolve the problem of economizing electric power without the active\r\ncooperation of every enterprise, plant, and trade union. Additional\r\nunspecified measures affecting industry were reported to have been taken\r\nin 1973 to reduce peak power loads, and the population was advised to\r\nuse electricity more sparingly between 6:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAW MATERIALS\r\n\r\nIn 1970 about 54 percent of the manufacturing industry's output was\r\nbased on industrial materials, and 46 percent was derived from\r\nagricultural raw materials; the proportion of industrial materials in\r\nmanufacturing continued on its post-World War II upward trend in the\r\n1960-70 period from a level of 24 percent in 1948 and 49 percent in\r\n1960. This trend was sustained by the relatively rapid rise in the\r\nproduction and imports of industrial materials compared to the slower\r\nincrease in agricultural output and imports. Because of the limitation\r\nof domestic resources, further industrial expansion will necessitate\r\never larger material imports.\r\n\r\n\r\nIron and Steel\r\n\r\nThe main deposits of iron ore are located at Kremikovtsi, northeast of\r\nSofia, and at Krumovo in the lower Tundzha valley. Other small deposits\r\nof little or no commercial value are scattered in the Strandzha\r\nmountains, in the western Stara Planina, and at several locations in the\r\nRodopi (or Rhodope Mountains). The ore in the Kremikovtsi deposit is of\r\nlow grade; it has a mineral content of about 33 percent and requires\r\nbeneficiation. Reserves at Krumovo were reported to be of better grade\r\nbut much smaller. Available evidence suggests that mining at this\r\ndeposit was discontinued after the mid-1960s. Its site is far removed\r\nfrom the country's two iron and steel mills.\r\n\r\nReserves at Kremikovtsi were estimated a number of years ago to contain\r\nfrom 200 million to 250 million tons of ore. An official\r\nRussian-language survey of Bulgaria, published in 1969, cited a figure\r\nof 317 million tons for total iron ore reserves but mentioned only the\r\nKremikovtsi deposit as one being mined. In a review of the country's\r\nnatural resources, published in a Bulgarian technical journal in\r\nmid-1970, it was stated that known reserves of iron ore would last\r\nanother fifty years. At the average annual rate of iron ore output in\r\nthe years 1968 and 1969 the reported life span of the deposits indicates\r\na reserve of only 133 million tons as of 1970. Whatever the actual\r\nreserves may be, domestic iron ore has had to be supplemented by imports\r\nof about 1 million tons per year from the Soviet Union and Algeria to\r\nmeet the requirements of the metallurgical industry.\r\n\r\nReserves of steel-alloying minerals are reported to be available,\r\nparticularly manganese, chromium, and molybdenum. The quality of the\r\nmanganese ores, however, is low, and reserves of chromium are\r\ninsufficient for the needs of the economy. Output data are available\r\nonly for manganese ore. Production of this mineral declined by about 60\r\npercent in the 1957-70 period, which suggests the depletion of known\r\nreserves. The metal content of the manganese ore mined in 1970 amounted\r\nto 10,300 tons. In that year the discovery of new manganese deposits in\r\nthe Obrocha area was reported, the eventual exploitation of which, it\r\nwas said, would not only provide for all domestic requirements but would\r\nalso make it possible to export manganese for an entire century.\r\n\r\nAlthough small amounts of ferroalloys are also obtained as by-products\r\nof copper, lead, and zinc smelting, imports must be relied upon to cover\r\nsubstantial deficits. Imports of manganese ores and concentrates in 1969\r\nand in 1970 were more than double the volume of domestic production, and\r\nimports of chromium and chromite amounted to 3,400 tons in 1969. Nickel\r\nand titanium were also imported.\r\n\r\nSteel is produced at the integrated Kremikovtsi metallurgical combine\r\nand at the smaller integrated Lenin Steel Works in Pernik. With Soviet\r\nassistance the Kremikovtsi combine is being expanded to a planned annual\r\ncapacity of 2 million tons of steel and 2.2 million tons of rolled\r\nproducts by the end of 1975. A third coking plant was put into operation\r\nin the spring of 1971, and the production of coke is scheduled to reach\r\n1.4 million tons in 1975, compared to an output of 837,000 tons in 1970.\r\nThe steel mill at Pernik is to be modernized, also with Soviet\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nProduction of pig iron and steel increased about sevenfold in the\r\n1960-70 period, reaching levels of 1.25 million tons and 1.8 million\r\ntons, respectively. The same was true of rolled steel products, the\r\nvolume of which rose to 1.42 million tons. Nevertheless, Bulgaria\r\nremained a net importer of iron and steel throughout the entire period.\r\nIn 1970 the import surplus amounted to 272,000 tons of pig iron and\r\n96,000 tons of steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNonferrous Metals\r\n\r\nReserves of nonferrous metals are reported to be more plentiful than\r\nreserves of iron ore. Unofficial claims have been made that copper\r\nreserves will meet requirements during the next fifty years despite the\r\nplanned rapid growth in output. Similarly, known reserves of lead and\r\nzinc ores were said to be sufficient to supply the needs of available\r\nsmelters until 1990. A foreign observer, however, noted that plans for\r\nlarge-scale expansion of nonferrous mining and smelting may be\r\nfrustrated by the deteriorating quality of the ores being mined and that\r\nmetal output may not rise much beyond the level attained in the late\r\n1960s. In fact, mine output of lead and zinc in 1970 was not higher than\r\nit had been in 1960, although the mine output of copper increased at an\r\nannual rate of 7.1 percent from 1967 to 1971. In this context it is\r\nnoteworthy that data on nonferrous metals were omitted from the official\r\nstatistical yearbook published in 1972.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 the minister of heavy industry pointed out that the relatively\r\nsmall planned increase in the output of the nonferrous metals industry\r\nin the 1971-75 period--22.8 percent--was dictated by inadequate\r\nsupplies of raw materials. He stated that prospecting for new deposits\r\nwould be intensified and stressed the urgent need to increase the degree\r\nof metal recovery from ores and the need to utilize fully all ore\r\ncomponents. Nevertheless, the minister assured his audience that the\r\nrequirements of the economy for copper, lead, and zinc in the 1971-75\r\nperiod would be met from domestic production, except for 3 to 10 percent\r\nof certain types of rolled metal. He called for the construction of\r\nplants to extract the metal from the industry's tailings as a means for\r\npartially eliminating the troublesome shortage.\r\n\r\nCopper is mined south of Burgas; in the Sredna Gora mountains near the\r\ntown of Panagyurishte; and in the western Stara Planina mountains, south\r\nof Vratsa. A deposit is also being developed at Chelopets, near Sofia.\r\nThe ore is concentrated locally and is smelted and refined in plants at\r\nEliseyna, Pirdop, and the Medet complex near Panagyurishte. Production\r\nof refined copper from ores and reused scrap increased from 14,000 tons\r\nin 1960 to 24,000 tons in 1965 and 41,000 tons in 1971. More than half\r\nthe copper output is processed into copper profiles, sheet, and wire at\r\nthe Dimiter Ganev plant in Sofia--the only plant for manufacturing\r\nrolled products. Bulgaria has both imported and exported copper and\r\ncopper products.\r\n\r\nLead and zinc are obtained from mines near the towns of Madan and\r\nRudozem, in the eastern Rodopi, and in the western part of the Stara\r\nPlanina, at Eliseyna and Chiprovtsi. A new lead mine is under\r\ndevelopment at Erma Reka, in the vicinity of Madan. The Rodopi mines\r\naccount for the major portion of the ore output. The ore is processed in\r\nflotation plants near the sites of the mines and is refined at\r\nKurdzhali, Plovdiv, and Kurilo.\r\n\r\nProduction of refined lead and zinc rose rapidly in the first half of\r\nthe 1960s but leveled off in the second. Substantial amounts of these\r\nmetals have been exported, mostly to Western Europe. Exports, however,\r\nhave been declining both in volume and as a proportion of output. The\r\ndecline has been more pronounced in the case of lead, and lead exports\r\ndropped from 65 percent of output in 1960 to 22 percent in 1970. The\r\nvolume of lead exports fell from 53,500 tons to 22,100 tons in the\r\n1965-70 period. Zinc exports declined from highs of 78 percent of output\r\nin 1965 and 58,100 tons in 1966 to 64 percent of output and 48,100 tons\r\nin volume in 1970.\r\n\r\nBulgaria also possesses small reserves of gold, silver, and uranium.\r\nGold has been found near the town of Trun, not far from the border of\r\nYugoslavia. Silver and uranium deposits are located in the western Stara\r\nPlanina. The uranium ore is processed by the Rare Metals Combine near\r\nSofia. Gold and silver are also obtained as by-products in the smelting\r\nof copper, lead, and zinc. Information on reserves and production of\r\nthese metals is not available. Aluminum and tin must be imported.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Raw Materials\r\n\r\nThere are reported to be adequate resources of nonmetallic minerals for\r\nthe production of cement and other building materials, glass, and\r\nceramics. Asbestos, salt, sulfur, and cement are produced in quantities\r\nlarge enough to allow some exports. The quality of asbestos, however, is\r\nlow, and better grades must be imported for some uses. Exports of cement\r\ndeclined from 715,000 tons in 1965 to 153,000 tons in 1970. Timber and\r\nwood pulp from domestic sources are in short supply. Under an agreement\r\nwith the Soviet Union, Bulgaria has supplied 8,000 workers to the timber\r\nindustry of the Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic for the\r\ndevelopment of Siberian timber resources, in return for which the Soviet\r\nUnion has undertaken to export to Bulgaria about 900,000 cubic yards of\r\ntimber in 1973 and up to 2 million cubic yards per year after 1975.\r\nSimilar arrangements exist with regard to paper pulp, iron and steel,\r\nnatural gas, and other raw materials.\r\n\r\nDomestic agriculture provides ample raw materials for the food\r\nprocessing industry, but only a fraction of light industry's needs for\r\nfibers and hides. In the 1968-70 period average annual imports of these\r\nmaterials included cotton, 60,000 tons; wool, 2,900 tons; synthetic\r\nfibers, 26,000 tons; and cattle hides, 7,700 tons. In addition to the\r\nraw cotton, cotton textiles in the amount of 63,000 tons were imported\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nBecause of the general shortage of domestic raw materials and the need\r\nto conserve scarce foreign exchange, strong emphasis has been placed on\r\nrecycling waste materials. A decree on this subject was issued in 1960,\r\nand a special Secondary Raw Materials State Economic Trust was created\r\nin 1965. Another comprehensive decree was issued in November 1971\r\nbecause, as stated in its preamble, the importance of collecting and\r\nusing waste materials had been underestimated, and the needs of the\r\neconomy were not being met. The new decree was intended to organize the\r\ncollection and processing of waste materials, including metals, paper,\r\nrubber, textiles, and worn-out machinery and household equipment, on a\r\nmodern industrial basis under the direction of the waste materials\r\ntrust. Special provision was made in the decree concerning the handling\r\nof unused machinery and surplus materials held by economic enterprises,\r\nand sanctions were provided for failure to surrender or refusal to\r\npurchase such surplus equipment and materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTMENT\r\n\r\nIndustry's share of total annual investment rose steadily from 34.2\r\npercent in 1960 to 47.3 percent in 1969 but declined in the next two\r\nyears to 43.9 percent. In absolute terms and in current prices, annual\r\ninvestment in industry increased from 466.3 million leva in 1960 to 1.6\r\nbillion leva in 1970 and declined to 1.58 billion leva in 1971.\r\n\r\nMore than four-fifths of the industrial investment in the 1961-71 period\r\nwas devoted to the expansion of producer goods industries. The\r\nproportion of investment funds allotted annually for this purpose was\r\nslightly lower in the 1966-71 period than it had been in the preceding\r\nfive years; it ranged between 84.7 and 87.8 percent in the 1961-65\r\nperiod and between 81.2 and 85.5 percent thereafter, except for 1970,\r\nwhen it declined to an atypical low of 78.5 percent.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of industrial investment was channeled into heavy industry,\r\nincluding fuel and energy production, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy,\r\nchemicals, and machine building and metalworking. In the 1960-65 period\r\nfuel and energy production were the major recipients of investment\r\nfunds; in subsequent years machine building and chemicals became the\r\nprimary targets of investment activity. Ferrous metallurgy was among the\r\nfive largest investment recipients through 1967, but nonferrous\r\nmetallurgy dropped from this group after 1964. Beginning in 1967\r\nsubstantial investment funds were also devoted to food processing--the\r\nmajor export industry and earner of foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nInvestment allotments to consumer goods industries ranged between 12.2\r\nand 18.8 percent of industrial investment, except for an unusually high\r\nallocation of 21.5 percent in 1970. In 1971, however, the investment\r\nshare of consumer industries dropped sharply to only 14.5 percent. The\r\npredominance of investment in heavy industry reflected the leadership's\r\nbasic economic policy tenet that, with minor temporary exceptions, the\r\nproduction of capital goods must develop more rapidly than the output of\r\nconsumer goods.\r\n\r\nConstruction of industrial plants has frequently fallen behind schedule,\r\ncausing losses of planned production and disruption of the five-year\r\nplans. The situation became critical in the fall of 1972 because of the\r\nfailure to commission on time new facilities that were counted upon to\r\nproduce in 1973, among other products, 0.5 million tons of rolled steel;\r\n0.4 million tons of mineral fertilizers; 30,000 tons of synthetic\r\nfibers; 20,000 tons of cellulose; 11,000 tons of polyethylene; 0.3\r\nmillion kilowatts of electric generating capacity; and a large volume of\r\nmachinery and equipment.\r\n\r\nThe main reasons for the construction lag were delays in the supply of\r\nmaterials and a shortage of construction workers. In an effort to\r\nexpedite the completion of the most essential projects that were under\r\nthe direct supervision of the Council of Ministers because of their\r\nnational importance, the council created a special operational bureau\r\nfor the coordination and control of the construction activities\r\nassociated with these projects. At the same time 6,000 workers were\r\ntransferred to the priority projects from less important construction\r\njobs. These measures did little to solve the basic problems and merely\r\nshifted the incidence of construction delays from one category of\r\nprojects to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR\r\n\r\nThe labor force in state and collective industry numbered 1.17 million\r\nworkers in 1971, of whom 542,000--or 46 percent--were women. The labor\r\nforce had increased by 54 percent compared with its size in 1960, and\r\nthe number of women workers more than doubled. About 88 percent of the\r\nworkers were employed in manufacturing; the remaining 12 percent were\r\nengaged in mining and energy production. Production of capital goods\r\nprovided employment for 52.5 percent of the workers, and consumer goods\r\nindustries absorbed the remainder. One-fourth of the labor force was\r\nconcentrated in machine building and metalworking, and another\r\none-fourth was occupied in food processing and textile production (see\r\nOrganization and Structure, this ch.).\r\n\r\nBy far the largest proportion of women workers--26 percent of their\r\ntotal number--were employed in the textiles and clothing branches of\r\nindustry, where they constituted 77 percent of total employment. Women\r\nconstituted the majority of workers in food processing--53 percent--and\r\naccounted for 21 percent of the workers in machine building and\r\nmetalworking. Substantial numbers of women were also employed in\r\nchemical and rubber plants, in logging and woodworking, and in the\r\nproduction of leather shoes and furs. Four-fifths of all women working\r\nin industry were in blue-collar jobs.\r\n\r\nAccording to official statistics, 95 percent of the workers in 1971 were\r\ndirectly engaged in production; the rest were employed in various\r\nauxiliary occupations, such as maintenance and warehousing. Yet in\r\noutlining means for raising industrial labor productivity in the fall of\r\n1972, the minister of labor and social welfare included as an objective\r\na reduction in the proportion of auxiliary personnel to about 30 or 35\r\npercent of the number of production workers in industry. About 17\r\npercent of the production workers were in white-collar jobs; information\r\non the total number of white-collar workers has not been published.\r\n\r\nThe majority of industrial workers are paid on a piecework basis, but\r\nthe importance of piecework has been declining and has varied widely\r\namong industrial branches. In 1971 almost 62 percent of the workers were\r\npaid on this basis--a significantly smaller proportion than the 80\r\npercent of workers remunerated in this manner in 1957. The proportion of\r\nworkers employed on the piecework basis in 1971 was highest in the\r\nmanufacture of clothing--89.5 percent--and lowest in the production of\r\ncoal and petroleum--25.2 percent. In construction, 84.6 percent of the\r\nworkers were paid on the piecework basis.\r\n\r\nThe average annual wage of all industrial workers in 1971 was 1,526\r\nleva, compared to an average of 962 leva in 1960. On the whole, wages of\r\nproduction workers were somewhat higher than wages of auxiliary\r\npersonnel, and the pay of white-collar production workers was higher\r\nthan that of blue-collar workers. The average wage of workers in\r\ncapital goods industries was 21 percent higher than the wage of workers\r\nin consumer goods industries. The wage was highest in mining and lowest\r\nin manufacturing. Within the state industrial branches, average annual\r\nwages ranged from 2,009 leva in the production of coal and petroleum to\r\n1,196 leva in the manufacture of clothing. Wages in collective industry\r\nwere generally lower than in state industry; the difference between the\r\naverage annual wages in these sectors was 12 percent.\r\n\r\nIndustrial productivity and growth have suffered from a shortage of\r\ntrained workers and technical personnel. The supply of skilled workers\r\nin the fall of 1972 was reported to be only half the number needed to\r\nfill available positions. Responsibility for this situation has been\r\nplaced, in part, on the lack of coordination between the industrial\r\nministries and the Ministry of National Education concerning technical\r\nand vocational training programs. There has been a pronounced\r\ndisproportion in the numbers of trainees in the various technical\r\nspecialities, and technical training generally has not been up to the\r\nlevel demanded by modern technology. Enterprises themselves have been\r\nslow in undertaking to train their own workers. The scarcity of skilled\r\npersonnel has been accentuated by the export of trained workers to the\r\nSoviet Union to help develop the exportation of mineral and timber\r\nresources in return for raw material imports.\r\n\r\nPoor labor discipline and excessive labor turnover have aggravated the\r\nshortage of skilled workers. The turnover has been particularly high\r\namong younger workers. Dissatisfaction with the job, or with living and\r\ntransportation conditions, and the search for better pay have been cited\r\nas the main reasons for the turnover. Progressively severe measures have\r\nbeen introduced to enforce stricter labor discipline, but their\r\neffectiveness has been weakened by lax application. One of these\r\nmeasures concerning movement of labor gave workers the right to quit\r\ntheir jobs freely but stipulated that any worker seeking reemployment\r\nhad to do so through district labor bureaus set up for that purpose. The\r\nbureaus would direct the job applicants to industries and positions\r\nwhere labor was most urgently needed. Because of the shortage of skilled\r\nlabor, however, enterprise managers continued to hire new labor without\r\nregard to the requirements of the law.\r\n\r\nThe shortage of adequately trained personnel adversely affects the\r\nutilization of available capacity; it entails frequent breakdowns of\r\nmachinery and inhibits multishift operation of plants. More than 20\r\npercent of worktime is usually lost through idling, and equipment is\r\nused at no more than 50 to 60 percent of capacity. New plants completed\r\nin 1967 had not reached full production in 1972. Productivity has also\r\nbeen kept low by the lack of mechanization of auxiliary activities, such\r\nas loading and unloading, inter- and intrashop transport, and\r\nwarehousing. In 1972 the minister of labor and social welfare stated\r\nthat labor productivity in Bulgarian metallurgy was only half as high\r\nas in some of the advanced industrial states.\r\n\r\nThe presence of unemployment has never been officially admitted, but a\r\ncertain degree of unemployment and underemployment, nevertheless, exists\r\nin several rural areas of the country. Recognition of this fact was\r\nevident in the decision of the BKP Central Committee plenum, published\r\nin March 1970, on the territorial redistribution of production forces\r\n(relocation of industry) and in subsequent economic studies concerning\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION\r\n\r\nGross industrial output amounted to about 13.9 billion leva in 1970 and\r\nreached 15 billion leva in 1971. According to official data, industrial\r\noutput more than tripled in the 1960-71 period. The high average annual\r\ngrowth rate of 11.1 percent was accounted for, in part, by the low\r\ninitial level of industrial development, as a result of which relatively\r\nsmall absolute increases in output were equivalent to high percentage\r\nrates of growth. The contribution of industry to national income (net\r\nmaterial product) rose from 46 percent in 1960 to 50 percent in 1969 but\r\ndeclined to 49 percent in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe most rapid growth occurred in basic industries that were given\r\npriority in the allocation of investment and labor. Production of the\r\niron and steel industry rose almost ninefold, and the output of fuels,\r\nchemicals, and rubber increased more than sixfold. The output of machine\r\nbuilding and metalworking industries increased 5-½ times, and the\r\nproduction of electric power, building materials, and cellulose and\r\npaper rose about fourfold. Preferential development of basic industries\r\ncontinued through 1972.\r\n\r\nThe lowest growth rates among basic industries were attained by the\r\ntimber and woodworking industry and nonferrous metallurgy. Some foreign\r\nobservers have wondered when the available nonferrous ore reserves have\r\nnot been exploited more intensively. As for timber production, its\r\nvolume has been restricted by the limitation of forest resources.\r\nProduction by consumer goods industries generally increased by from 2.1\r\nto 2.7 times, except for glass and porcelain wares, the output of which\r\nrose almost fivefold.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important industries in terms of output value in 1970\r\nwere food processing, and machine building and metalworking; these\r\nindustries accounted for 25.4 and 20.2 percent of total output,\r\nrespectively. Next in importance, with 9.1 percent and 7.5 percent of\r\nthe total were the textile and the chemical and rubber industries. The\r\noutput of the clothing industry--4.9 percent of total output--surpassed\r\nthe production of fuels. The contributions of other industries to the\r\ntotal industrial output ranged from 0.9 to 3.7 percent. The structure of\r\nindustrial output in value terms reflects, in part, the system of prices\r\nused in valuing the output.\r\n\r\nAlthough the country's industrial development has had a history of only\r\ntwo decades, industry produces a wide variety of industrial and consumer\r\nproducts, including machine tools, ships, computers, automatic telephone\r\nexchanges, and television sets (see table 20). Bulgaria was also\r\nreported to possess the largest plant in Europe, and second largest in\r\nthe world, for the production of electric forklifts and similar\r\nindustrial vehicles. The quality of many products, however, though\r\nimproving, has not measured up to average world standards. In 1972 the\r\nchairman of the Administration for Quality Standardization, and\r\nMetrology stated that his organization was confronted with a difficult\r\nlong-term task of developing an effective quality control system and of\r\ncatching up and keeping pace with the constantly rising world quality\r\nstandards. In his view, attainment of these goals required a fundamental\r\nimprovement of domestic quality standards, effective organizational and\r\ntechnical measures, well-conceived incentives, and an enormous amount of\r\nindoctrination of the personnel involved in production. The chairman was\r\nconfident, nevertheless, that the country's industry would eventually\r\noutstrip the qualitative standards of developed industrial nations in\r\nthe same way that it had succeeded in outstripping these nations'\r\nindustries with regard to quantitative growth.\r\n\r\n_Table 20.

NATIONAL SECURITY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\nPUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo maintain order and to retain control of the population, party and\r\ngovernmental authorities rely on a number of police and security\r\norganizations that are able to exert physical force and, also, upon a\r\ngroup of large social organizations that are able to apply social\r\npressures. When individuals, in spite of the efforts of the law\r\nenforcement agencies and the social organizations, engage in antisocial\r\nor criminal behavior, the courts are charged with handing down\r\nappropriate sentences, and the penal institutions are concerned with\r\nrehabilitating the individuals for eventual return to society as\r\ncooperative and productive members.\r\n\r\nPeople's Militia units throughout the country are the local police\r\nforces that enforce the laws, combat crime, and monitor the population.\r\nThey are assisted in local law enforcement by part-time voluntary\r\nparamilitary auxiliaries and, in serious situations, by a small,\r\ncentrally organized, full-time internal security force that can act as a\r\nlight infantry unit and move quickly to any part of the country. State\r\nsecurity police, evolved from the secret police of the 1940s and 1950s\r\nbut much reduced in size, deal with crimes that are national in scope or\r\nthat pose a threat to the society or its institutions. Authorities\r\ncredit the security police with having almost eliminated the possibility\r\nof large-scale subversive activities. The militia, its volunteer\r\nauxiliaries, and the security units are organized within the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs.\r\n\r\nBorder and construction troop organizations are administered separately.\r\nThe Border Troops, charged with defense of the country's boundaries and\r\nwith control of a border zone around the country's periphery, are a part\r\nof the Bulgarian People's Army and are under the Ministry of National\r\nDefense. The Construction Troops are labor forces, but the bulk of their\r\npersonnel comes from the annual military draft, and they are organized\r\ninto regular military units and are subject to military regulations and\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the individual citizen are defended in the 1971\r\nConstitution and in the Criminal Code of 1968, which was not altered by\r\nthe constitution. The latter states that a crime can only be an act so\r\nidentified in the code and for which a punishment is prescribed. These\r\nprinciples can and have been abused--the state is set above the\r\nindividual, and the judicial machinery is within an agency of the\r\nexecutive branch of the government--but those who exercise the machinery\r\nhave become increasingly responsive to its guiding statutes. The limits\r\non punishments that are set down in the code allow somewhat greater\r\nsentences to be handed down upon those committing crimes against the\r\nstate or state property than upon individuals or private property.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL SECURITY\r\n\r\nState and Internal Security Forces\r\n\r\nDuring the time of readjustment after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953,\r\nBulgaria's police state period gradually came to a close. In the postwar\r\nperiod until then, the country had had police machinery modeled on that\r\nof Stalinist Soviet Union, with state security troops (secret police)\r\nand garrisoned interior troops equipped like mobile army infantry units.\r\nThe state security troops, the garrisoned interior troops, and the\r\nregular police forces are estimated to have totaled about 200,000 men.\r\n\r\nAlthough state and internal security organs have been shifted among\r\nministries and renamed, and there has been an occasional move to abolish\r\nthem, they continue to exist in Bulgaria. Although the organizational\r\nform is probably much the same as before, that is, an internal security\r\nforce and a state security police, the security apparatus has only a\r\nfraction of its former personnel and has been shorn of its more\r\narbitrary powers. According to some observers, Bulgaria has emerged from\r\na police state, wherein security forces held arbitrary powers of arrest\r\nthat instilled fear in the people, to a police bureaucracy in which the\r\nmilitia meddles in peoples' lives to the point of public frustration.\r\nPeople no longer have reason to fear the tyranny of a secret police, but\r\nthey have developed a strong resentment of the petty militia regulations\r\nthat affect their daily lives.\r\n\r\nState security functions--those that deal with espionage, treason, and\r\nthe group of so-called political crimes aimed at undermining or\r\nupsetting the system--have been performed by a separate secret police\r\norganization that was typical in communist systems, particularly during\r\nthe Stalinist period. An overriding preoccupation with state security\r\nhas not been as prevalent in Bulgaria as in many communist countries,\r\nbecause the communist government had established itself firmly in\r\ncontrol of the country in a relatively short time. Nonetheless, a\r\nsizable secret police force existed for many years and, after a reign of\r\nterror lasting until 1948, the secret police contributed to a general\r\natmosphere of repression that lasted until the mid-1950s. After that\r\ntime most police functions were assumed by the People's Militia, and the\r\nsecret police faded into the background, greatly reduced in size and\r\nimportance but still functioning within one of the government\r\nministries.\r\n\r\nAfter the unsuccessful coup d'etat of April 1965, there was a resurgence\r\nof secret police activity with the creation of the new Committee of\r\nState Security. As the political situation stabilized in the late 1960s,\r\nthe Committee of State Security was reabsorbed into the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs, where the remaining units of state security police\r\ncontinue to operate. They are evidently considered necessary in order to\r\ntake care of relations with foreigners, to collect some military\r\nintelligence at the governmental level, and to monitor any potential\r\nespionage or criminal activities that might pose a threat to the state.\r\nThe day-to-day role of the small remnant of the internal security force\r\nis unknown. This elite, militarized unit, however, is probably held as a\r\nbulwark against any large-scale, organized dissension.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People's Militia\r\n\r\nThe People's Militia (local police) deals with crime and maintains\r\nroutine day-to-day contacts with the people. The militia operates under\r\nthe control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and has intermediate\r\nadministrative offices at the level of the _okrug_ (district) and local\r\npolice stations at the _rayon_ (municipal) or _obshtina_ (urban borough\r\nor village commune) level. Although the primary control descends from\r\nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs, all militia organizations have a\r\ndegree of responsibility to the people's councils at their levels.\r\n\r\nLocal militia forces ordinarily work only in the areas under the\r\njurisdiction of their people's councils. In urgent circumstances they\r\nmay be called upon the Ministry of Internal Affairs to assist the\r\nmilitia in neighboring areas, and they may even cross _okrug_ lines. To\r\noperate outside their own areas on their own volition they must have the\r\npermission of an agency in the ministry.\r\n\r\nThe police are charged with maintaining order, enforcing the laws,\r\nprotecting personal and public property, and regulating traffic. They\r\nassist governmental and party agencies in the execution of their various\r\nresolutions, orders, and instructions. They monitor the rules of\r\nresidence and the collection of taxes. In the event of natural disasters\r\nor major accidents they are equipped to rescue, to give first aid, and\r\nto transport victims to medical facilities. They supervise observance of\r\nquarantine measures imposed by health authorities. They monitor drinking\r\nestablishments to ascertain that alcoholic beverages are not served to\r\nalcoholics, obviously drunken persons, juveniles, and drivers of motor\r\nvehicles. They are instructed to combat rowdy and irresponsible\r\nbehavior--hooliganism, begging, and vagrancy--and other antisocial\r\nmanifestations. They see that unsupervised and stray children are\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nMany militia functions are peripheral to the primary police duties of\r\nlaw enforcement and criminal investigation. Such functions include\r\nsocial controls having diverse objectives ranging from gun control to\r\nkeeping undesirables off Sofia streets during visits of foreign\r\ndignitaries. The police have unusual powers in dealing with beggars,\r\nvagabonds, and others in the category that they classify as socially\r\ndangerous. Some of the controls are directed at preventing crime; others\r\nappear intended to reduce the possibility of incidents on occasions when\r\nthe presence of such persons could be embarrassing. The regulation\r\nallows the police to prohibit individuals from visiting specified towns\r\nor areas or even from leaving their residences for a twenty-four-hour\r\nperiod. Some may be prohibited from meeting certain other specified\r\npersons or from frequenting certain parts of towns. Such restrictions\r\ncan be for definite or for indefinite periods of time. Persons may be\r\ndenied the use of common carriers or the privilege of attending sports\r\nevents or of visiting certain public institutions. Some, prostitutes for\r\nexample, may be denied the right to become telephone subscribers. If\r\nthey think it advisable, the police may require some persons whom they\r\nare monitoring to report to them on a daily or other regular basis.\r\n\r\nIndividually held weapons, ammunition, and explosives are accounted for\r\nand are registered with the militia. Certain forestry and farm\r\npersonnel, hunters, sportsmen, and youth organizations are authorized to\r\nretain controlled weapons. Explosives are permitted when they are\r\nrequired in, for example, construction projects. By law there is no\r\nproduction of cold weapons--brass knuckles, daggers, scimitars, and the\r\nlike--in the country.\r\n\r\nThe police collect or maintain a major share of local records for the\r\n_obshtina_ people's councils. These records deal with vital statistics,\r\ncitizenship, identification, travel visas, registration of residences,\r\nlicenses and permits, and employment data. A person acquires Bulgarian\r\ncitizenship in the circumstances that are accepted in most other\r\ncountries--by ancestry, place of birth, or naturalization--but there may\r\nbe somewhat more than the usual number of situations in which he may\r\nlose it. Persons are deprived of citizenship if they leave the country\r\nunlawfully, leave lawfully but fail to return within a reasonable time\r\nafter their visas expire, go abroad to avoid military service, acquire\r\nforeign citizenship in a manner not specified in Bulgarian law, or if\r\nthey conduct themselves abroad in ways that are contrary to Bulgaria's\r\ninterests or that are unworthy of a Bulgarian citizen. Persons not\r\nethnically Bulgarian are released from their citizenship upon\r\nemigration, although they are not released unless all of their\r\nobligations in the country are settled.\r\n\r\nLaws governing the stay of foreigners in the country also are\r\nadministered and enforced by the militia. According to the revised law\r\nthat took effect in 1972, the whereabouts of a foreigner is subject to\r\nthe same rules that apply to Bulgarian citizens. His hotel or other\r\nlocal address, therefore, must be reported to the militia within\r\ntwenty-four hours of his arrival at each stop. Tourists are usually\r\nunaware that such detailed records of their stays are being maintained,\r\nbecause hotel personnel ordinarily take care of the reporting. If the\r\nvisitor stays at the home of a Bulgarian, that citizen must report his\r\npresence on the same twenty-four-hour basis.\r\n\r\nA foreign visitor may travel freely otherwise, except that he may not go\r\nto certain restricted areas or to the border zone at any place other\r\nthan at one of the designated crossing points. He must leave the country\r\nwhen the time specified in his visa has expired unless he has a criminal\r\ncharge against him and is awaiting trial, has been sentenced and is\r\nserving a term in prison or at a correctional labor camp, or has the\r\nobligation to provide support for a person in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorder Troops\r\n\r\nThe Border Troops are part of the Bulgarian People's Army and are\r\norganized within the Ministry of National Defense. Border units resemble\r\nregular military forces more than they do the police. They are\r\nconsidered militarized security units, and some 15,000 men serve in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTheir mission is described as safeguarding the country's frontiers\r\nagainst penetration or illegal crossing. Because they are a part of the\r\nregular armed forces, it is presumed that in time of war they would work\r\nin coordination with those forces. If the enemy were to penetrate into\r\nBulgaria, the Border Troops would be expected to control the area\r\nimmediately behind the ground forces. If Bulgarian armies were driving\r\nthe enemy beyond the borders, they would probably remain at the old\r\nborder or establish a new one if the leadership expected to retain any\r\nnewly occupied territory.\r\n\r\nThe most strictly defended borders are those shared with Greece, Turkey,\r\nand Yugoslavia, but the border with Romania is also defended. The Border\r\nTroops operate a number of patrol boats, both on the Danube River, where\r\nit forms the border with Romania, and along the Black Sea coast. The\r\ntroops also control the movement of people into and within a border\r\nzone, which is a strip approximately eight miles wide in from the\r\nborder. Smuggling, however, even large-scale smuggling, is the concern\r\nof the Ministry of Internal Affairs customs police and not of the Border\r\nTroops.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstruction Troops\r\n\r\nA Bulgarian institution that is unique among the Eastern European\r\ncommunist countries is the organization known as the Construction\r\nTroops. Thousands of young men who are not called for service in the\r\nregular armed forces are drafted into the Construction Troops, from\r\nwhich the government derives productive labor at the same time that it\r\ninstills military discipline and political indoctrination into a large\r\nsegment of the young male population. Similar organizations have been\r\nmaintained since the establishment of the original Labor Service in the\r\nearly 1920s, which was a means of circumventing the World War I peace\r\nterms that prohibited large conscript military forces. Obligatory\r\nmilitary service was restored during the 1930s and, as part of the\r\nchange, the Labor Service was militarized. It was made a part of the\r\narmy and remained so during World War II, when it became known as the\r\nLabor Army.\r\n\r\nTwo types of compulsory labor forces emerged after the communist seizure\r\nof power in 1944. The Labor Army continued in existence and, following\r\nthe example of the Soviet Union under Stalin and of the other states in\r\nthe Soviet post-World War II orbit, Bulgaria also placed those of its\r\ncitizens considered politically dangerous in forced labor camps. These\r\nwere the prison colonies populated by victims of the secret police,\r\npersons who might or might not have had proper trials but who were\r\nconsidered to be enemies of the party or the government. Some camps were\r\ntemporarily located at sites where large numbers of manual laborers were\r\nneeded, but more often camps were at permanent locations. Buildings at\r\nall camps were flimsy, and facilities were minimal. In the early period,\r\nwhile the Communists were establishing their control over the country,\r\nabout 1 percent of the population was imprisoned at hard labor in such\r\ncamps at any given time.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s the Construction Troops organization that had evolved\r\nfrom the Labor Army was military in form and character. Its men were\r\nprovided from the annual draft and were subject to military regulations\r\nand discipline. Its officers, who had regular military ranks, were\r\nprovided from the armed forces or had been prepared for that specific\r\nassignment in the Construction Troops own school. The headquarters of\r\nthe organization, however, was a main administration responsible\r\ndirectly to the Council of Ministers; it was not within either the\r\nMinistry of National Defense or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\r\nFurthermore, the work of the organization was heavy construction and, at\r\nleast in peacetime, the greatest portion of it was unrelated to any\r\nrequirement of the armed forces. The Construction Troops worked on\r\nvarious construction projects on a five-day-week basis but assumed a\r\nmilitary routine on Saturdays, which were devoted to platoon and company\r\ndrill and to political education classes.\r\n\r\nUntil the mid-1960s the troops were used mainly in roadbuilding and land\r\nreclamation. By the early 1970s more than one-half of their work was in\r\nfactory, housing, water supply, and other such construction. Its 1972\r\nprojects included building a tire manufacturing plant and a resort hotel\r\ncomplex and harnessing a river for hydroelectric power, recreation, and\r\nsupplies of irrigation water and city water. One of the organization's\r\nspokesmen claimed that there was not a large-scale project underway\r\nanywhere in the country where its troops were not at work.\r\n\r\nThe men acquired in the annual draft serve two years, which satisfies\r\ntheir military service obligation. Almost all of the conscripts in the\r\nConstruction Troops work as unskilled laborers. During or at the end of\r\ntheir two-year tours, those who enjoy or show a special aptitude for\r\nconstruction work may volunteer for extended duty tours and serve as\r\nnoncommissioned officers. Some of those who are accepted are sent to\r\ntechnical schools for further education.\r\n\r\nCareer officers who are educated in the Construction Troops service\r\nacademy are expected to serve for ten years after graduation. This\r\nschool, the full title of which is the General Blagony Ivanov People's\r\nMilitary School for Officers in the Construction Troops, offers a\r\nso-called semihigher course of instruction. Applicants to it must have\r\ncompleted their secondary education, and its three-year course can be\r\nused for undergraduate transfer credit toward a university-level degree\r\nelsewhere. Many graduates continue their education at the Higher\r\nInstitute of Construction and Engineering in Sofia, from which they may\r\nreceive a further career specialization and bachelor's or advanced\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nAuthorities responsible for the civil defense program justify their\r\nefforts by arguing that modern warfare has virtually eliminated the\r\ndifference in importance between the armed forces at the front and their\r\nsupport in the rear areas. They stress that it is essential to provide\r\nfor continued production and delivery of supplies, primarily foodstuffs,\r\nthat are needed for survival. Such arguments have been effective in\r\nBulgaria, and civil defense training is compulsory for all citizens from\r\ntwelve to sixty years of age.\r\n\r\nThe civil defense organization is staffed at all administrative levels\r\nin the country. It is within the Ministry of National Defense in the\r\nnational government and has committees under the people's councils in\r\neach _okrug_ and _rayon_ or _obshtina_. Committees or working teams are\r\nalso set up in manufacturing plants, enterprises, schools, and\r\ncollectives. Indicative of the importance placed upon civil defense\r\nactivities, its national chief in the early 1970s was one of the deputy\r\nministers of national defense, a level shared with only the topmost\r\nofficers of the military establishment.\r\n\r\nCivil defense tasks are divided into three categories. The first\r\nincludes provision of shelters and defense for the population, providing\r\nwarning of attack, and training of the people for implementation of\r\ndispersal and evacuation plans and for defense and salvage work. The\r\nsecond includes implementation of measures intended to maintain\r\nproduction and to keep transportation, communications media, and power\r\nsupplies in operation. The third includes industrial salvage,\r\nrestoration of production, fire fighting, decontamination, and provision\r\nof medical assistance.\r\n\r\nSpecific work assignments vary widely in differing locations and\r\nenterprises. For example, industrial teams train to maintain or restore\r\nproduction. Agricultural teams work to save crops, farm animals, or to\r\nprotect feed and watering spots. People's councils at all levels, party\r\nand youth groups, and the mass organizations are instructed to assist in\r\nspecific ways and to volunteer in other ways as opportunities arise.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for civil defense activities varies widely. One town with a\r\npopulation of just over 1,000, for example, built or modified areas to\r\nshelter 6,000 people. In more typical situations tasks such as those of\r\ncivil defense that have little to contribute to the needs of the moment\r\nreceive much lower priority.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC ORDER\r\n\r\nThe Communist Party and Social Organizations\r\n\r\nThe most important element in establishing control of the country at the\r\ninception of the post-World War II communist government was the\r\nBulgarian Communist Party (BKP--see Glossary), with the iron discipline\r\nit held over its carefully chosen members and its single-minded planning\r\nand direction. After gaining control, the party attempted to retain its\r\nexclusive character, insofar as possible recruiting as members only\r\nthose whose loyalty was unquestioned and who could organize and lead.\r\n\r\nTo maintain control based on a broader segment of the population, the\r\nparty then encouraged the development of a number of social and\r\nspecial-interest organizations, designed to appeal to the interests of\r\nas many of the people as possible and to enlist them in activities that\r\nshape public opinion, regulate the conduct of the people, and support\r\nthe party and its policies. These organizations ranged in size from the\r\nextremely large Fatherland Front and the trade unions to the painters,\r\nwriters, and composers unions, whose memberships numbered between 100\r\nand 800 (see ch. 9).\r\n\r\nWith the exceptions of the party, the Fatherland Front, and the small\r\nartists unions, these groups are called mass organizations. The small\r\nunions do not qualify because they are far from massive in size; the\r\nparty and the front have the requisite membership, but they are set\r\napart from the others. The Fatherland Front attempts to gather members\r\nfrom all other socially or politically active organizations in the\r\ncountry, combining as many as possible of them within it. Its membership\r\nincludes nearly one-half of the country's population. The party,\r\nalthough ostensibly a member organization of the Fatherland Front, is\r\nset above all other organizations. It controls and directs the others\r\nand requires them to support it in general and specific ways (see ch.\r\n9).\r\n\r\nThe largest of the mass organizations are, in descending order, the\r\ntrade unions, the Bulgarian Red Cross, the Dimitrov Communist Youth\r\nUnion (Dimitrovski Komunisticheski Mladezhki Suyuz--commonly referred to\r\nas the Komsomol), the Bulgarian Union for Physical Culture and Sports,\r\nand the Bulgarian Union of Tourists. Their memberships range from about\r\n1 million to approximately 2.5 million. The Bulgarian Agrarian Union,\r\nthe Bulgarian Hunting and Fishing Union, the Teachers Union, and the\r\nScientific and Technical Union are much smaller, having memberships\r\nbetween 100,000 and 200,000. The Fatherland Front attracts nearly 4\r\nmillion people; the party has 700,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nYouth Programs\r\n\r\nThe first sizable leftist youth organization in the country, then called\r\nthe Union of Working Youth, was formed in 1926, and by 1940 it had a\r\nmembership of approximately 15,000. It and the party furnished most of\r\nthe partisan fighters that harassed the Germans and the pro-German\r\ngovernment of the country during World War II. Both the party and the\r\nyouth group grew stronger during the war, largely because the partisan\r\ncause was more popular than that of the government.\r\n\r\nThe youth organization became the Dimitrov Communist Youth Union after\r\nthe war. The new name did not come about from a major reorganization or\r\nreorientation of the group; transition to its postwar status was smooth,\r\nbut it saw fit to honor Georgi Dimitrov, who had by then become the most\r\npowerful and famous of the party's leaders. Even after its renaming in\r\nDimitrov's honor, the organization has usually been referred to, in\r\nofficial government communications as well as in conversation, as the\r\nKomsomol, which is the name of the Soviet Union's youth organization.\r\n\r\nThe Komsomol became the organization through which the party reached the\r\nnation's youth. Its responsibilities were expanded, and its membership\r\ngrew rapidly. In the ideal situation the entire youth segment of the\r\npopulation of eligible age, both male and female, would be members of\r\nthe organization. In 1970 its 1.16 million members did include about 77\r\npercent of those between fourteen and twenty-four years of age. Some of\r\nthe organization's leaders, instructors, and exceptionally active\r\nmembers stay in the group beyond the upper age limit of twenty-four, but\r\ntheir number is too small to alter the membership statistics\r\nsignificantly. Male members outnumbered female members by a large\r\nmargin; 88 percent of the eligible males were members, only 66 percent\r\nof the females. The disparity in membership by sex reflects the fact\r\nthat more of the organization's activities--sports and premilitary\r\ntraining, for example--appeal to or are oriented toward the future\r\nneeds of the males. Membership is either a prerequisite for admission to\r\nhigher educational institutions or makes admission much easier.\r\n\r\nStatistics notwithstanding, party and other national leaders complain\r\nthat Komsomol membership is lower than it should be, but they have\r\ngreater concern about the number who are members merely for expediency\r\nand who are apathetic toward the organization's activities. A low point\r\nin the Komsomol's appeal was reached during the 1960s and, sensing an\r\nurgent need to reattract the cooperation of the nation's youth, its\r\nprograms were given a major reevaluation and overhaul beginning in about\r\n1968.\r\n\r\nThe youth problem in 1968 was probably less serious in Bulgaria than it\r\nwas in many Western countries and other communist countries, but it had\r\nreached proportions that warranted action. Among symptoms cited by the\r\nauthorities was apathy toward education, work, and party ideology. Young\r\npeople in rural areas seemed anxious to move to the cities, where\r\nidleness, crime, and so-called parasitic living were increasing.\r\nConsumption of alcohol by young people was up markedly.\r\n\r\nMany young people were described as silent nihilists, persons who were\r\ncharacterized by unresponsiveness and vast indifference. No expression\r\nof group youth protest, for example, was recorded between the inception\r\nof the communist government and the late 1960s. When individual\r\ncomplaints were solicited, however, they appeared to come out freely.\r\nSome said that they would have cooperated but spoke of the anemic and\r\nempty lives of the youth organizations where the dull, boring meetings\r\nconsisted largely of upbraiding sermons full of pious admonitions and\r\nreprimands. Others assumed an offensive posture, indulging in\r\nself-praise, pointing out shortcomings in party work, complaining about\r\nthe lack of individual freedom and the lack of opportunity for showing\r\ninitiative, and criticizing the older generation.\r\n\r\nConsumption of alcoholic beverages is common enough in typical families\r\nso that early exposure to it is considered natural, but its use by young\r\npeople became excessive enough to be considered a national problem in\r\nthe mid-1960s. According to a survey published in 1971, more than 50\r\npercent of the students in Sofia secondary schools consumed alcohol\r\nregularly. Percentages were considerably higher in provincial secondary\r\nschools. Few of the youthful users had consumed it over a long enough\r\nperiod to have become addicted, but more than one-half of the inebriated\r\npersons brought to sobering-up facilities in Sofia hospitals and clinics\r\nwere young people.\r\n\r\nAuthorities blame advertising of alcoholic beverages, imitation of\r\nWestern fashions, disillusionment, and monotony in daily living for most\r\nof the increase in youthful drinking. They also blame lax parental\r\ncontrol, but the surveys concluded that the influence of contemporary\r\nsocial habits and the pressures of peer groups were forces more\r\npowerful than those exerted by the family.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been undertaken to reduce the so-called parasitic element\r\nthat according to party and governmental spokesmen, is composed of those\r\nwho neither study nor work. As early as 1968 the minister of national\r\neducation was given six months to organize a nationwide program to cope\r\nwith the problem, and the Center for Amateur Scientific and Technical\r\nActivities among Youth and Children was created to coordinate planning.\r\nThe Committee for Youth and Sports, the State Committee on Scientific\r\nand Technical Progress (renamed the State Committee for Science,\r\nTechnical Progress, and Higher Education), the Komsomol, and the trade\r\nunions were charged with contributing ideas and assistance. As a result\r\nof the center's activities, the next year each _okrug_ was directed to\r\norganize schools with three-month-long vocational training courses and\r\nto canvass its area for young people who required the instruction.\r\nEnterprises in the _okrug_ were directed to cooperate by indicating the\r\nskills they most needed, by furnishing facilities and, finally, by\r\nhiring those who completed the training.\r\n\r\nAs of 1972 the program had achieved spotty or inconclusive results. Most\r\nspokesmen considered it as satisfactory as could have been expected.\r\nThey did not consider that it reflected badly on the effort when a few\r\ngroups reported that about 30 percent of the students who completed\r\ntheir classes never reported to the jobs for which they had been\r\nprepared and that others stayed at work for only a short time. Other\r\nobservers consider that the authorities are concerned over a problem\r\nmuch of which does not exist or that is blown out of proportion to its\r\nseriousness. For example, 85 percent of the offending group were girls\r\nor young women. A few of them were undoubtedly ideological malcontents,\r\nmembers of youth gangs, prostitutes, or criminals, but a large majority\r\nconsidered themselves living inoffensively at home or, at the worst,\r\nwere working at small family enterprises. In rural areas they might have\r\nbeen attending the family's private agricultural plot or the privately\r\nowned livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIME AND JUSTICE\r\n\r\nCrime\r\n\r\nThe country's most widely quoted authorities on crime view it as a\r\nsocial phenomenon, that is, actions by people within society against the\r\ninterests of the society as a whole or against the principles directing\r\nit. Combating crime, therefore, becomes a matter both of law enforcement\r\nand of social edification and persuasion. Although they adhere to the\r\nargument that in a developing communist society most of the crime is\r\nrelated to holdover attitudes from the old society and to unavoidable\r\ncontacts with such societies still existing, they do not expect to\r\neradicate crime according to any existing timetable.\r\n\r\nPetty crime is an irritant to the leadership, not so much for the damage\r\nor lasting effects of the individual criminal acts, but because such\r\nacts reflect an attitude on the part of the perpetrators indicating that\r\nthey hold the society, if not in ridicule or contempt, at least in less\r\nthan proper respect. Such attitudes prompted an official in the Ministry\r\nof Internal Affairs to state, \"Social democracy does not take a\r\nconciliatory attitude toward petty criminals, or tolerate individuals\r\nwho disturb the public order or who are engaged in a parasitical life.\"\r\nThe actual amount of petty crime is less worrisome to the authorities\r\nthan the fact that it is increasing. Also disturbing are statistics\r\nshowing that most of those apprehended for it are in the\r\neighteen-to-thirty-year age-group.\r\n\r\nAuthorities have found themselves facing a problem in relation to petty\r\ncrime that is in no way unique to Bulgaria. Misuse of government\r\nproperty, including theft and pilfering, has become rampant and is\r\nconsidered forgivable by those who are guilty because \"everybody does\r\nit.\" The courts have become reluctant to hand down harsh sentences upon\r\npeople who consider that they have done no wrong and, at least in the\r\nopinion of some government spokesmen, lenient court sentences have\r\nhelped foster a view that theft of public property is wrong only because\r\nit is so described in certain of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe authorities also point out that statistics accumulated on such\r\nthefts reported in 1970 are revealing in other respects. Almost 90\r\npercent of those recorded fell into the category of petty crime, but\r\nabout one-half of them were carried out by overcoming locks or other\r\nbarriers protecting the property. Over one-half of the persons\r\napprehended for such thefts were repeaters. Analysis of other records\r\nalso indicated that in all but a very few cases the most serious crimes\r\nwere committed by individuals who had begun their criminal careers by\r\nstealing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the courts were handing down sentences of the minimum\r\npunishment for theft or even less than the prescribed minimum. More\r\noften than not, the culprits were given suspended sentences. Of those\r\nconvicted of serious theft, less than one-half were sentenced to a\r\nperiod of deprivation of freedom considered appropriate--that is, the\r\nsix months or more prescribed in the criminal code.\r\n\r\nMore serious are the crimes of violence, political crimes, and economic\r\ncrimes involving abuse of management positions or large amounts of\r\nproperty. In the period since the mid-1950s crimes of violence have\r\nincreased; political and serious economic crimes have decreased.\r\n\r\nCitizens convicted of political crimes no longer constitute the bulk of\r\nthe prison population, as they did during the early post-World War II\r\nperiod. Active or aggressively vocal opposition to the regime is usually\r\ncalled ideological subversion, diversion, or revisionism, and it is\r\ndescribed as activity or expression of thoughts related to the old\r\nsociety and not in accord with the policies of the new. It is still\r\nlisted among the more serious crimes. Officials of the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs blame both external influences and dissident internal\r\nfactions for having caused the Hungarian revolution in 1956 and the\r\nCzechoslovak troubles in 1968. They say, however, that such events are\r\nunlikely in Bulgaria because the ministry's state security agencies are\r\nbusy combating foreign intelligence efforts and the native elements that\r\nwould bore from within. The success of their efforts is credited with\r\nhaving reduced political trials to only a few each year.\r\n\r\nEconomic crimes include those of dishonest or illegal operation of an\r\nenterprise, the misuse of socialist property by its management or\r\nworkers, currency manipulations, and improper sale or transfer of\r\nproperty. If inefficient management practices are serious enough to\r\nresult in less than optimum production, they are considered criminal,\r\nbut sufficient guilt has been difficult to prove, and those accused are\r\nrarely, if ever, prosecuted. They are occasionally reprimanded,\r\ntransferred, or dismissed for bureaucratic practices. Management\r\npersonnel who are brought before the courts are usually tried for\r\ncorruption, using their positions for personal enrichment, or violation\r\nof administrative or financial regulations.\r\n\r\nWorkers can be prosecuted for theft, waste, willful damage, or illegal\r\nuse of materials. Poor labor discipline, shirking on the job, or\r\nnonmalicious negligence may result in individuals or entire work shifts\r\nbeing brought before party groups or trade union committees. Action in\r\nsuch cases usually involves counseling, social pressure, or the like.\r\n\r\nConsumption of alcohol is not excessive when compared with that of other\r\nEuropean countries, but it has been increasing steadily and has been a\r\nmajor contributor to crime and antisocial behavior. During the 1960s per\r\ncapita consumption of absolute alcohol increased by a factor of nearly\r\n50 percent, from 4.01 quarts per person annually to 5.93 quarts.\r\nStrenuous efforts on the part of the country's leadership to combat the\r\ntrend resulted in a decrease between 1968 and 1970, but the dip in\r\nconsumption was temporary. Per capita consumption in 1971 reached the\r\nhighest level yet recorded.\r\n\r\nPolice are involved in aspects of the programs combating the rise in\r\nconsumption of alcohol and alcoholism because alcohol has figured\r\nincreasingly in crime. Nearly 90 percent of those charged with rowdiness\r\nor disturbing the peace were under its influence, as were increasing\r\npercentages of those apprehended on rape, assault, and murder charges.\r\n\r\nMany more men than women have alcohol problems, but the percentage of\r\nwomen problem drinkers has risen more rapidly. Similarly, consumption by\r\nyouths is less than that of adults, but the numbers of youths becoming\r\nhabitual drinkers has been increasing. Many of the campaigns against\r\nthe use of alcohol are also directed against smoking and drugs, although\r\nneither of these is considered a cause of serious concern. Smoking is\r\nviewed as an evil that may be damaging to the user's health but that has\r\nno serious social consequences. By 1973 drugs had not become a serious\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe police monitor a large number of alcoholics whose conditions are\r\nchronic but who can work. These persons get a period--ordinarily from\r\nsix months to a year--of compulsory treatment. This may include work\r\ntherapy in groups that are supervised to the degree necessary to prevent\r\nthe members from acquiring alcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nIncreasing tourism has resulted in special problems in resort areas.\r\nSpokesmen note that what they refer to as petit bourgeois attitudes\r\ntoward moneymaking have shown up, especially at the new Black Sea\r\ncoastal resorts. Local people inflate prices for tourists, accept and\r\nencourage tips, and buy and sell merchandise illegally. On some\r\noccasions the Bulgarians exploit their guests; at other times the\r\nforeigners exploit the local population. Most seriously viewed of the\r\nadverse tourist influences are the introduction of unacceptable ideology\r\nand foreign encouragement of moral laxity which, according to the\r\nauthorities, pervades the area. Occasionally, however, there is an\r\nexample of an ideological diversity in a direction opposite that of lax\r\nmorality. One group of tourists was evicted from the country after\r\ndistributing what the police described as forty Bibles and 150 godly\r\nbooklets. Many tourists enter the country by automobile; traffic has\r\nbecome congested, and violations of traffic laws are more numerous than\r\nthe police can cope with.\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal Code\r\n\r\nThe criminal code's preamble states that its purpose is to protect the\r\nsociety and the state, the person and the rights of its citizens, the\r\neconomy, and the state's property and laws and to educate the citizens\r\nin the rules of life in the socialist society. It defines crimes as\r\nsocially dangerous acts that are identified and declared by law as\r\npunishable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the qualification that a crime must be set down as such\r\nand declared punishable, the individual is further protected by the\r\nstipulation that he may be punished only when he has been found guilty\r\nof one of the listed crimes by a proper court. The punishment may be\r\nonly what is set down in the code and declared consistent with the\r\ncrime, and it may be imposed only by the court trying the case.\r\n\r\nAdults, eighteen years of age or older, are criminally liable. Minors,\r\nbetween the ages of fourteen and eighteen, are criminally liable if they\r\nare judged capable of understanding the act and its significance and of\r\ncontrolling their actions. Juveniles under fourteen years of age and\r\nmentally deficient persons unable to understand the nature or\r\nsignificance of a criminal act are not criminally liable.\r\n\r\nCourts may hand down punishments of eleven different varieties. In\r\naddition to fines, confiscation of property, and confinement, they may\r\nsentence a guilty person to corrective labor or compulsory residence\r\nwithout confinement. They may deprive an individual of the right to\r\noccupy certain governmental or public positions, of the right to\r\npractice certain professions or activities, of the right to residence in\r\na specified place, or of the right to earn decorations and awards. If he\r\nis on duty with the military, a court may remove his rank. It may also\r\nadminister a public reprimand, alone or in combination with another type\r\nof punishment. The sentence, however, should be within the upper and\r\nlower limits in the amounts of fines or the time period for which the\r\nother sentences may apply. Such limits are set down in the code.\r\n\r\nThe death penalty is never a mandatory sentence in peacetime. It is\r\noptional for a considerable number of crimes, but it is handed down only\r\nif the circumstances of a particular crime that is before the court are\r\nexceptionally serious. When the maximum sentence is deprivation of\r\nfreedom and does not include a possible death sentence, the duration of\r\nthe sentence will be no longer than fifteen years. If the maximum\r\nsentence can be death, twenty years deprivation of freedom may be\r\nsubstituted for execution.\r\n\r\nThe stipulated sentences for crimes against the state tend to be more\r\nsevere than sentences for crimes against individuals. Theft of public\r\nproperty is punishable by confinement of up to eight years, of private\r\nproperty by no more than three years. Robbery involving public property\r\nmay result in a sentence of from three to ten years; if it involves\r\nprivate property, the range is from three to eight years.\r\n\r\nAlthough the individual's rights appear to have more than ample\r\nsafeguards, the situation may be less utopian than the wording of the\r\ncriminal code would suggest. For example, a 1973 amendment to the laws\r\npertaining to personal property states that \"when a citizen is found to\r\npossess more property than he could reasonably have acquired from his\r\nregular income, he is considered to have acquired it illegally unless he\r\ncan prove to the contrary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts\r\n\r\nAll of the formal judicial machinery of the country is within the\r\ngovernmental organization under the Ministry of Justice, but special\r\ncourts--such as those of the military establishment--may be administered\r\nseparately and independently in their lower echelons. Although the\r\nministry serves as a part of the executive branch of the government, as\r\nthe interpreter of laws it can check upon their compatibility with the\r\nconstitution and other legislation. It might also function as a check\r\nupon the powers of the legislature and upon the other ministries in the\r\nexecutive branch. So far as is known, however, during the framing of\r\nlegislation its professional expertise is used only to provide technical\r\nadvice on the phrasing or structure of the text, to make sure that it\r\nsays in legal terms what the framers intend (see ch. 8).\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Justice is responsive to the policies of the BKP,\r\nalthough the minister appears to be chosen for his professional\r\nqualifications. In the early 1970s the incumbent was one of the very few\r\nimportant officials in the government who did not also have a\r\nhigh-ranking party position, and only one of his immediate staff was a\r\nmember of the Central Committee of the BKP. None of the others is\r\nbelieved to have had an equivalent party status.\r\n\r\nEach people's council has a legal department or a group that provides it\r\nwith legal counsel. The chiefs of such departments at _obshtina_ level\r\nare appointed and relieved by the _okrug_ people's council.\r\n\r\nThe size and legal qualifications of the legal staff vary with the\r\npopulation of the _okrug_ or _obshtina_. The departments at _okrug_\r\nlevel and those of the larger _obshtini_ have staffs that are relied\r\nupon for competence in a wide range of criminal and administrative\r\nprocedures; the legal problems that are encountered by a remote rural\r\n_obshtina_ are usually minor.\r\n\r\nLegal departments are charged with monitoring the activities of the\r\npeople's councils and their committees to keep them consistent with the\r\nlaw; with interpreting laws for the people's councils and for\r\ninhabitants in the area of their jurisdiction; with strengthening the\r\ncontractual and financial disciplines of the people's councils and of\r\nenterprises within their areas; and, as a by-product, with tightening\r\nthe safeguards on public property. Most of the daily work of the\r\ndepartments consists of giving legal counsel to the people's councils\r\nand of reviewing the councils' resolutions to ensure that they conform\r\nto national laws and party policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPenal Institutions\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Justice is responsible for the overall administration,\r\nactivities, and security of prisons. Outside guards are provided by the\r\nMinistry of Internal Affairs. According to the regulations, the primary\r\nresponsibilities of prison administrators are to rehabilitate and to\r\nreeducate inmates.\r\n\r\nReeducation includes political reorientation, general education, and\r\nvocational training. All inmates are obligated to receive political\r\nindoctrination, which is intended to reorient them toward becoming\r\ncooperating members of the community. All of them are also required to\r\nperform useful labor--for vocational training, prison income, and\r\nbenefit to the state. General education is compulsory for all prisoners\r\nunder forty years of age who have not completed eight years of primary\r\nschooling. Vocational training, other than that derived from prison\r\nlabor, varies with facilities available.\r\n\r\nThe physical facilities for confinement are classified as prisons,\r\nlabor-correctional institutions, and correctional homes. The\r\ncorrectional homes are for minors. According to the seriousness of the\r\noffense and other factors, a prisoner may be confined in light, general,\r\nstrict, or enforced strict disciplinary regimes, one of which is\r\nspecified in his court sentence. The light regime is prescribed for\r\nfirst offenders who are serving time for minor crimes. The enforced\r\nstrict regime is applied to recidivists, as an alternative to the death\r\nsentence, or to those considered dangerous or willfully and excessively\r\nuncooperative. The stricter regimes have less comfortable cells and\r\nfurnishings, more rigid discipline, fewer individual privileges, and\r\ntighter security.\r\n\r\nPrisoners are segregated by age, sex, and disciplinary regime. Women and\r\nminors serve their sentences in separate prisons or correctional homes.\r\nThey are subject to much the same schedules as those in the prisons for\r\nmale adults, except that theirs have no enforced strict regime.\r\nAccording to the law, those serving in different regimes are to be\r\nconfined separately, and repeaters are to be confined in separate\r\nprisons from first offenders. Because there are a limited number of\r\nprisons, it may be necessary to meet the law's requirement for\r\nseparation of prisoners by having different regimes in wards or\r\nbuildings of the same prison complex.\r\n\r\nThe law on prison labor states that prisoners have the right to\r\nemployment and political education and, at the same time, that they have\r\nthe obligation to do the work and receive the political indoctrination.\r\nInmates are given work assignments within seven days of their arrival at\r\na prison. Their wages are based on the norms for the same kind of work\r\ndone in enterprises throughout the country, and the same work and safety\r\nregulations apply. Inmates receive 20 percent or more of their wages.\r\nNone except minors, incapacitated persons, or individuals who would work\r\nbut who are for some reason unemployed may receive money from the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nPrisoners have the right to communicate with the prosecutors and courts\r\nthat investigated and tried their cases and to submit petitions to them\r\nand to the Ministry of Justice. They may also see the chiefs of their\r\nprisons, correctional homes, or labor-correctional institutions in\r\nperson. Other rights include time outdoors, exercise, visitors,\r\ncorrespondence, food parcels, possession of personal effects, and\r\nmeetings and special correspondence with lawyers or other persons having\r\na status or authority relative to their sentencing or confinement. The\r\namount of time outdoors and correspondence and the numbers of visitors\r\nand parcels allowed vary with the severity of the inmate's disciplinary\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence and parcels are opened and inspected by prison officials.\r\nVisits are monitored; conversation must be in Bulgarian unless the\r\nadministration has or can find a person who can understand the language\r\nto be spoken. Inmates are not allowed to gamble, consume alcohol, use\r\nnarcotics, or sell or exchange personal property with other inmates.\r\nMinors may not smoke. Prisoners and their property may be searched.\r\n\r\nPrisoners are rewarded for good behavior and punished for bad. When his\r\npattern of conduct has become apparent over a period of time and it\r\nappears appropriate, a prisoner may be moved into a lighter or more\r\nsevere disciplinary regime. If he has insufficient time remaining in his\r\nsentence to be moved into a different regime, he may be given extra\r\nprivileges or be denied some of those to which he would ordinarily be\r\nentitled. Commitment to solitary confinement is limited to two weeks at\r\nany one time.\r\n\r\nA number of sentences do not involve confinement. For a group of\r\noffenses related to poor working discipline, an individual can be given\r\na corrective labor sentence. This usually involves harder work, somewhat\r\nlonger hours, and strict supervision on the job. The law also provides\r\nfor sentences that restrict the movement of an individual. In the most\r\nsevere of these, he may be banished to and be required to remain in one\r\ncertain area. In other situations he may be prohibited from visiting\r\nspecified areas or, in the least severe case, he may visit but not take\r\nup residence in some specified locality.\r\n\r\nAnother such sentence involves \"internment without deprivation of\r\nliberty.\" This sentence restricts the individual to his place of\r\nresidence or to another specified place. The term is usually from one to\r\nthree years but, in the case of a repeated crime or in some other\r\nspecial circumstance, it can be for as long as five years. The essence\r\nof the penalty is that it consists of a restriction to the confines of\r\nthe area within which the offender lives and works. He may not hold a\r\njob outside of the area, but he does not live in a special billet, nor\r\nis he isolated from his neighbors and local society. The usual\r\nobjective, when this type of sentence is handed down, is to keep the\r\nindividual in his home environment, where he retains responsibility for\r\nhis share of the family support and is subject to its influences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\nARMED FORCES\r\n\r\n\r\nBulgaria's regular military forces are organized within the Bulgarian\r\nPeople's Army (Bulgarska Narodna Armiya) and are subordinate in the\r\ngovernmental system to the Ministry of National Defense. Approximately\r\n80 percent of the personnel are in the ground forces. Of the remaining\r\n20 percent about three-quarters are in air and air defense units, and\r\nabout one-quarter are naval forces.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bulgaria is possibly the most staunch and sympathetic of the\r\nSoviet Union's allies in Eastern Europe, the country has no common\r\nborder with the Soviet Union nor with any other of its Warsaw Treaty\r\nOrganization (Warsaw Pact) allies except Romania. Because Romania has\r\nsucceeded in establishing a precedent prohibiting movement of any\r\nforeign forces across its borders--even those of its closest\r\nallies--Bulgaria is to a large degree isolated from pact affairs. Unable\r\nto participate in more than token fashion in pact training, short of\r\nskilled men to care for complex equipment, and possibly restricted from\r\nan ability to become engaged during the early days of a combat\r\nsituation, Bulgaria has undoubtedly lost some Soviet matériel support.\r\n\r\nBecause of this the forces have only small armored units, although the\r\nmilitary establishment as a whole is large in relation to the population\r\nof the country. The air forces have been supplied with a few modern\r\naircraft, but most of its airplanes are older than those of its pact\r\nallies. Naval forces are small. Even though logistic support has been\r\nmeager, morale has been considered good, and the men and their leaders\r\nhave been considered ideologically reliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe communist leadership considers only a few incidents in the history\r\nand tradition of the armed forces before World War II to be significant.\r\nEven in respect to that war, the sole esteemed service is that of the\r\npartisans in their resistance movement against their own government and\r\nagainst German troops in the country. Driving out the Turks to gain\r\nnational independence in 1878 is remembered, as is the abortive uprising\r\nof the leftists against the government in September 1923. Emphasis on\r\nonly these few historical events is encouraged, at least in part,\r\nbecause in much of their other warfare Bulgaria's fighting men\r\nfrequently experienced frustration or defeat, sometimes violent and\r\nhumiliating.\r\n\r\nAs no indigenous armed forces had been allowed during the five centuries\r\nof Ottoman occupation, there were no national forces at the time that\r\nindependence was gained. The uprising by the local population two years\r\nearlier, in 1876, had been heroic, and it contributed to the weakening\r\nof the Turkish grip on the land, but it was a failure at the time. It is\r\nstill, however, remembered. On ceremonial military occasions a roll call\r\nof the local men killed in the uprising is read aloud at memorial rites.\r\n\r\nParticipation in four wars between 1912 and 1945 produced negative\r\nresults for the country. Bulgarian forces were engaged in a major share\r\nof the fighting during the First Balkan War (1912) but, from its\r\nstandpoint, the country received an inadequate share of the spoils at\r\nthe peace table. A year later, when Turkey and its former allies joined\r\nforces against Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria was defeated.\r\n\r\nAllied with Germany in both world wars, Bulgaria experienced defeat\r\ntwice more, although the situation was somewhat different in World War\r\nII. The government and nationalists bent on acquiring territory they\r\nconsidered theirs--primarily from Greece and Yugoslavia--succeeded in\r\njoining in the war on Germany's side. The population was generally far\r\nmore sympathetic to the Soviet Union, however, and during the years of\r\nGerman success in the early part of the war, Bulgarian forces did little\r\nin support of their ally. In the latter days of the war, as the Germans\r\nwere being driven back, the Bulgarians joined the armies of the Soviet\r\nUnion. In fact, the 30,000 casualties they claim to have suffered in\r\ncampaigns against the Germans were far more than were suffered in their\r\nsupport (see ch. 2).\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, when the Communists had gained control of the\r\ncountry, training and unit organization were modeled on those of the\r\nSoviet army; heavy matériel items were supplied by the Soviet Union; and\r\nall other equipment was made to adapt to Soviet specifications.\r\nPersonnel considered unreliable by the new regime were weeded out as\r\nfast as possible, and rigorous measures were taken to ensure that\r\npolitical orientation considered correct in the new atmosphere would be\r\nadhered to by those who replaced them.\r\n\r\nEquipment received first was surplus to the needs of the Soviet Union as\r\nthree-quarters or more of its massive wartime forces were demobilized.\r\nReplacement matériel came more slowly, having to await the reequipping\r\nof Soviet units, but by the late 1950s the most essential combat weapons\r\nhad been upgraded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENTAL AND PARTY CONTROL OVER THE ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\nThe armed forces are subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense,\r\nwhich is one of the governmental ministries whose chief is a member of\r\nthe Council of Ministers. Administration and routine operational\r\ncontrols are accomplished through government channels. The party,\r\nhowever, has policy authority and ultimate operational control. Division\r\nof authority is more apparent than real because nearly all high-ranking\r\ngovernmental officials are also important party members. The minister of\r\nnational defense in 1973, Army General Dobri Dzhurov, was also a member\r\nof the party's Central Committee. Almost without exception the higher\r\nranking military officers are party members, as are nearly 85 percent of\r\nthe officers of all ranks. The 15 percent who are not in the party are\r\njunior officers who are still members of the Dimitrov Communist Youth\r\nUnion (Dimitrovski Komunisticheski Mladezhki Suyuz), commonly referred\r\nto as the Komsomol. Only a small percentage of Komsomol members become\r\nparty members, but all except a very few of the young officers are\r\nselected for party membership when it becomes apparent that they\r\nprobably will be successful career officers.\r\n\r\nPolitical education is given priority equal to that of combat training\r\nat all levels in the military organization. Party cells are formed in\r\nall units where there are three or more party members; Komsomol cells\r\nexist in virtually all units. In 1972, 65 percent of the armed forces\r\nparticipated in scientific-technical competitions, symposia,\r\nconferences, reviews, exhibitions, and other Komsomol activities.\r\n\r\nOne-man command has superseded the dual control system of the 1950s. In\r\nthose days a political officer was placed alongside the commanding\r\nofficer of all units to ensure the reliability of the forces. The\r\npolitical officer was in many ways equal in authority to, and\r\nindependent of, the commander. The unit commander has allegedly\r\nreassumed a position where he is described as the central figure,\r\nleader, planner, and organizer; he is responsible for the discipline and\r\ncombat effectiveness of his unit and for fulfilling its party tasks. The\r\nunit commander's deputy is still a political officer in most units and,\r\nalthough there is no question of his subordinate position, the political\r\nofficer is still responsible in part directly to the Main Political\r\nAdministration of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION AND MISSION\r\n\r\nThe several military forces under the Ministry of National Defense are\r\nreferred to collectively as the Bulgarian People's Army. The army\r\nincludes the ground, naval, and air and air defense forces and also the\r\nBorder Troops (see ch. 15). Tradition prevails in common usage and even\r\nin official pronouncements, so that when the term _army_ is used alone,\r\nit invariably refers to the ground forces or the directorates and\r\nservice organizations that are common to all of the forces. Naval and\r\nair forces are frequently referred to as though they were separate\r\nservice branches.\r\n\r\nUniformed military personnel permeate the Ministry of National Defense.\r\nAll deputy ministers and, with the exception of the medical branch, all\r\nmajor administrative chiefs are military officers. During the early\r\n1970s the first deputy minister of national defense was also chairman of\r\nthe General Staff and chief of the ground forces. One of the deputies\r\nwas chief of the air and air defense forces, and all of the others were\r\ngenerals. Following the pattern of other Warsaw Pact armed forces\r\norganizations, the political, rear services (logistics), training,\r\narmor, artillery, communications, engineering, and chemical sections are\r\ndirectorates, administrations, or branches responsible to the minister\r\nof national defense. This is the case in spite of the facts that such\r\nbranches as armor and artillery are concerned primarily with the ground\r\nforces and that others--training, for example--must be tailored to\r\nwidely different kinds of operations of all the individual services.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is the point of contact between the Warsaw Pact nations and\r\nGreece and Turkey, which are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) countries on the southern flank of the Soviet alliance. Although\r\nlittle is known of Warsaw Pact war plans, it is probable that Bulgarian\r\nforces would be charged with containing an attack from the south.\r\nStatements of military leaders indicate that considerable thought has\r\nbeen given to the problems they would face in a nuclear war. They\r\napparently anticipate involvement in the initial engagements but, if\r\nnuclear weapons are used, they would employ holding tactics, staying\r\nalert to exploit any opportunities that might develop. Their\r\npronouncements repeatedly affirm a determination to perform their pact\r\nmission to the best of their capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nGround Forces\r\n\r\nThe ground forces have approximately 120,000 men. Their major units\r\nconsist of eight motorized rifle divisions and five tank brigades. There\r\nare also various smaller special purpose units and support\r\norganizations. The forces are distributed among three territorial\r\ncommands having headquarters at Sofia, Plovdiv, and Sliven. The division\r\nis the basic organizational unit in Warsaw Pact combat forces and has\r\nabout 10,000 men. Five of Bulgaria's divisions are believed to be near\r\ncombat strength, but three probably have only skeletal strengths and\r\nwould be built up with the mobilization that would accompany a major\r\nnational emergency.\r\n\r\nEach of the other Warsaw Pact armies has a number of tank divisions. The\r\nfact that Bulgaria has only tank brigades, which are probably one-half\r\nor less the strength of divisions, reflects the austerity of its armed\r\nforces. Motorized rifle divisions have one tank regiment, one artillery\r\nregiment, and three motorized rifle regiments. The tank brigades,\r\nbecause they are smaller, probably have fewer tanks than the motorized\r\nrifle divisions.\r\n\r\nMost of the tanks used by the Bulgarian army are the early post-World\r\nWar II model T-54. There are some newer models in the inventory, and a\r\nfew of the older World War II T-34s are still being retained. Artillery\r\npieces include guns and gun-howitzers from 82 mm to 152 mm, antitank\r\nweapons up to 100 mm, and small antiaircraft guns. Some units are\r\nequipped with short-range missiles and unguided rockets. There are\r\nenough personnel carriers or self-propelled weapons so that all men in a\r\nunit can be transported simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir and Air Defense Forces\r\n\r\nThe air and air defense forces have approximately 20,000 men, 250 combat\r\naircraft, an assortment of antiaircraft guns, a few surface-to-air\r\nmissiles, and a modest quantity of air defense radar and communications\r\nequipment. Combat aircraft are organized in squadrons, usually with\r\ntwelve airplanes each. In 1973 there were six fighter-bomber, twelve\r\nfighter-interceptor, and three reconnaissance squadrons.\r\n\r\nThe fighter-bomber squadrons use the MiG-17, an aircraft that is\r\nobsolescent but that performs well in a ground support role. About\r\none-half of the fighter-interceptors are also MiG-17s, but three of the\r\ninterceptor squadrons have the newer MiG-21. The only bomber aircraft in\r\nthe air forces is the near-obsolete Il-28. The Il-28 squadron has a\r\nreconnaissance role. A few old cargo or passenger planes provide a\r\nminimal transport capability, but there are about forty helicopters that\r\ncan perform shorter range personnel and transport functions.\r\n\r\nAir defense forces are positioned to provide protection for the\r\ncountry's periphery as well as for a few cities and air installations.\r\nGround and naval forces have antiaircraft weapons to defend their own\r\nunits. Early warning radars are located mainly along southern and\r\nwestern borders, and their communications lines are presumably linked\r\nwith the Warsaw Pact air defense warning network.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Forces\r\n\r\nNaval forces, with only about 7,000 men, constitute less than 5 percent\r\nof the armed forces' personnel strength. They man a variety of vessels,\r\nhowever, including escort ships, patrol boats, torpedo boats, two\r\nsubmarines, and miscellaneous supply and service vessels. They also\r\ninclude a contingent of naval infantry, or marines. Some of the smaller\r\ncraft make up a Danube River flotilla. Other than the torpedo- and\r\nmissile-carrying patrol boats, the major offensive strength consists of\r\nthe submarines, which are Soviet-built W-class medium boats, and about\r\ntwenty landing craft. All of the larger vessels built since World War II\r\nhave been Soviet built or designed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the naval mission includes tasks confined to the portion of the\r\nBlack Sea near Bulgaria's coastline, a few fleet units have joined the\r\nSoviet fleet for maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea, and the naval cadet\r\ntraining ship sails any of the high seas. For example, it visited Cuba\r\non its 1972 summer cruise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN MILITARY RELATIONS\r\n\r\nBulgaria joined the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,\r\nRomania, and Albania in bilateral treaties of friendship, cooperation,\r\nand mutual assistance during the early post-World War II period and\r\nadded another with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) a few\r\nyears later. This group became the tighter and more formal Warsaw Pact\r\nmilitary alliance in 1955. Albania dissociated itself from the pact in\r\nthe early 1960s, and its treaties with Bulgaria and the other members\r\nhave not been renewed since then. Bulgaria's treaties with the remainder\r\nof the original allies have been renewed regularly and are the cause for\r\nofficial observances each year on their anniversary dates.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bulgaria may be the most loyal and reliable of the Soviet\r\nUnion's allies, military cooperation between the two countries is\r\nlimited by their geographical separation. Even if Romania were to permit\r\nBulgaria's forces to cross its territory in order to participate in\r\nWarsaw Pact training, it is probable that Bulgaria's role in a future\r\nEuropean war would be limited to southeastern Europe, an area that would\r\nbe of less immediate concern at the outset of a war between the Warsaw\r\nPact members and NATO. In any event, air and sea transport is in limited\r\nsupply and is not used for the delivery of large numbers of Bulgarian\r\ntroops to exercises in an area where they probably would not be\r\nemployed. As a consequence, Bulgaria sends only token forces and\r\nobservers to the larger pact exercises.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is not a warm proponent of ideological coexistence but is\r\nstrongly in favor of arms reductions and limitations on future weapons.\r\nIt was a member of a United Nations disarmament committee in the early\r\n1970s, and much space in the printed media is devoted to support of\r\nproposals for restricting deployment and use of nuclear weapons in\r\ncertain areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANPOWER, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT\r\n\r\nManpower\r\n\r\nInterpolations of the United Nations estimate of the country's 1973\r\npopulation indicate that there were about 2.3 million males in the\r\nfifteen- to forty-nine-year age-group, which Bulgarian authorities\r\nconsider military age. There were also about 70,000 in the annual groups\r\nthat were reaching the draft age of nineteen each year. Those\r\nconscripted serve two- or three-year duty tours. The basic ground force\r\ntour is two years; that of special units and air and naval forces is\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nApproximately 70 percent of the military age groups, or 1.6 million\r\nmales, are considered physically and otherwise fit for military duty.\r\nAny number of them could be called up in the event of an emergency\r\nrequiring total mobilization, but it is likely that many of the group\r\nwould be occupying positions having higher priority than basic military\r\nduty. A somewhat larger proportion, or about 75 percent, of the\r\nnineteen-year-olds are in satisfactory physical condition. Most of them\r\nare drafted; a turnover of one-third of the 150,000-man regular armed\r\nforces each year would require nearly all of the group. Because there is\r\nvery little room for flexibility, a young man's education is interrupted\r\nunless he was actually enrolled in a university or college before he\r\nreached the age of eighteen. In this case he continues his education but\r\nserves his military obligation upon completion of his education.\r\nOccupational deferments were eliminated by law in 1970, and other\r\ndeferments are given infrequently and reluctantly. Young men unfit for\r\nmilitary duty or for work in the Construction Troops, but who are fit to\r\nearn a living in some other work, pay a military tax (see ch. 15).\r\n\r\nThose who have had military service and who have not reached the age of\r\nfifty are considered reserves. Officers remain in the reserve until the\r\nage of sixty. Various factors--primarily occupational situations,\r\nphysical condition, and lack of reserve training--operate to erode this\r\nforce, and those considered useful, or trained, reserves constitute\r\none-half or less of the group. Most of the some 250,000 men released in\r\nthe latest five-year period, however, are available, physically fit, and\r\nfamiliar with the weapons and equipment in use by the armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn common with its Warsaw Pact allies, Bulgaria uses equipment that is\r\nproduced or designed in the Soviet Union or that is compatible with\r\nSoviet designs. The training program is patterned after that of the\r\nSoviet army because the Soviet equipment dictates the training required\r\nto maintain and operate it, and joint maneuvers participated in by any\r\nor all of the pact forces make it necessary to employ standard\r\nprocedures and tactics.\r\n\r\nThe program is carried on in an annual cycle. Immediately after\r\ninduction a conscript's time is spent in so-called individual or basic\r\ntraining. Physical exercise is rigorous, and the soldier is initiated\r\ninto the care and use of individual weapons, military drill, and the\r\nvarious aspects of military existence with which he had not been\r\nfamiliar and to which he must learn to adjust. He also learns individual\r\nactions that may become necessary in group or combat situations, ranging\r\nfrom personal combat techniques to first aid treatment for battle wounds\r\nor exposure to gas or nuclear radiation.\r\n\r\nAs the cycle progresses, the individual usually becomes part of a crew\r\nmanning a larger weapon or a more complex piece of equipment. When the\r\ncrew knows its equipment, it then becomes involved in exercises of\r\nincreasing size, in which it learns to employ weapons and equipment in\r\ncoordination with other systems. The training cycle culminates in late\r\nsummer or autumn with the largest of the year's maneuvers. Although the\r\nmore important Warsaw Pact maneuvers have been held in the northern\r\ngroup of Eastern European countries, smaller exercises are held in\r\nBulgaria and are occasionally participated in by visiting Soviet or\r\nRomanian forces.\r\n\r\nAir defense crews with small-caliber antiaircraft guns and tracking\r\nradar practice in conjunction with the early warning network and air\r\ndefense communications. After target identification they practice\r\nholding their weapons on the aircraft by radar or visual sighting.\r\nTarget aircraft average about 450 miles per hour and fly just above the\r\ntreetops.\r\n\r\nGround forces train with a wide variety of weapons and in many\r\nsituations, but they claim special capabilities and excellence in\r\nmountain and winter exercises. These maneuvers are scheduled to exploit\r\nthe long winter nights and fog, snow, or blizzard conditions to teach\r\ntroops how to achieve surprise in encircling movements. Troops\r\nexercising in the snow are provided a white outergarment for camouflage.\r\n\r\nCombined arms exercises are held when all support units are engaged in\r\nsupporting offensive operations led by tank and motorized rifle groups.\r\nIn such exercises the equipment is used as realistically as possible,\r\nwith blank ammunition and training grenades. Ultra-shortwave\r\ncommunication equipment, whose normal fifty- to sixty-mile range would\r\nsuffice more than adequately in small maneuver areas, is relayed over\r\nlong distances to simulate a more typical combat situation.\r\n\r\nPolitical education is the responsibility of a main administration of\r\nthe Ministry of National Defense and has status on a par with the other\r\nmost important ministry functions. The administration states its mission\r\nas \"cultivating moral-political and combat virtues that train men and\r\nunits for skillful and selfless action under the conditions of modern\r\nwarfare.\" Its leaders stress the point that, although large forces and\r\nmassive firepower are employed in modern combat, the complexity and use\r\nof weapons is such that individual initiative is increasingly important.\r\nA small group left alone to employ a highly complex weapon must be able\r\nto make decisions and must be motivated to do the best that is possible\r\nunder any kind of unpleasant circumstances.\r\n\r\nPolitical indoctrination is also aimed at combating potentially\r\nsubversive elements. Political instructors urge stronger \"ideological\r\nvigilance\" and act to counter the influences of, for example, Western\r\nradio stations.\r\n\r\nSchools and the Komsomol, with the various youth clubs and organizations\r\nthat it sponsors, are charged with preparing predraft-age youths for\r\nmilitary service. A preliminary training program was reorganized and\r\nrevitalized in 1968. National leaders had noted that the physical\r\ncondition of the average conscript was becoming less satisfactory each\r\nyear and that the idea of serving in the armed forces appeared to be\r\nmeeting with resistance from a small but increasing number of youths.\r\nThey also were aware that juvenile crime was increasing. Sensing that\r\npoor physical fitness, a reluctance to perform military duty, and\r\nincreasing crime could be related and have common causes, they\r\nattributed much of the problem to a change in youth attitudes. Political\r\nindoctrination and ideological subjects, presented in an attempt to\r\nencourage a more proper attitude are, therefore, given highest\r\npriorities in the new program.\r\n\r\nThe formal portion of the program initiated in 1968 consists of a\r\nschedule of premilitary training, obligatory for all young men and women\r\nbetween the ages of sixteen and eighteen. Facilities for it were made\r\navailable in schools for those who were students and at cooperative\r\nfarms, enterprises, or anywhere that groups of working youths were\r\nemployed. Young army officers on active duty and reserve officers in the\r\nlocal area were made available for classroom and field instruction.\r\n\r\nThe party's Politburo issued a statement in March 1971 to the effect\r\nthat the Komsomol had successfully organized the required program. It\r\ncited statistics on recreational facilities, among which were camps that\r\nwere preparing to accept 125,000 boys and girls for that summer. Camp\r\nprograms feature political instruction, physical training, sports\r\nactivities, military field training, and a wide variety of specialized\r\nsubjects. Other Komsomol cells sponsor aero clubs for those interested\r\nin air force service and rowing, sailing, and diving clubs for those\r\ninterested in the navy. Radio communication, vehicle driving,\r\nmarksmanship, and many other subjects are sponsored at year-round\r\nclasses in local areas.\r\n\r\nOther than preinduction orientation, conscripts get their basic\r\ntraining, weapons and skills specialization, and combat training while\r\nin the service. Noncommissioned officers may also come up from the ranks\r\nand be prepared for better positions at in-service schools, but they may\r\nalso attend special schools and enter regular military units for the\r\nfirst time with a noncommissioned officer grade. Noncommissioned officer\r\nsecondary schools were provided for in a 1971 law. The schools were to\r\nbe available to acceptable applicants who had completed the eighth grade\r\nand were seventeen years of age or younger. The courses would last a\r\nminimum of three years, during which students would be considered to be\r\non active military duty and after which graduates could continue in the\r\nservice as noncommissioned officers. If an individual did not go on with\r\na military career, he would be credited with a completed secondary\r\nschool education and also with the completion of his regular required\r\nmilitary service. Under any but exceptional circumstances, however,\r\ngraduates would be obligated to serve in the armed forces for at least\r\nten more years.\r\n\r\nCadet programs in several university-level higher military schools\r\nprovide officers for the services. Applicants to these schools must have\r\ncompleted secondary school, be active members of the Komsomol, and\r\nindicate an intention that, upon graduation, they would accept\r\nappointment to serve in one of the armed services. They must also be\r\nsingle, in excellent physical condition, and under twenty-four years of\r\nage. Many apply during their tours of conscript service but are accepted\r\nonly if they have the prerequisite educational qualifications.\r\n\r\nLine officers for infantry or armored units and logistics officers have\r\nfour-year courses. Engineer, signal, transportation, artillery,\r\nelectronics, and other technical specialties are five-year courses, as\r\nare those that fit candidates for air and naval careers. The men are\r\ncommissioned in a common ceremony shortly after they have graduated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorale and Conditions of Service\r\n\r\nThe basic ingredients of good morale are present in good measure in\r\nBulgaria's armed forces. The vast majority of the troops believe in\r\ntheir overall mission, take their obligation for granted, enjoy a\r\nrespected status, and receive valuable training. The country's principal\r\nally, the Soviet Union, is a long-standing friend and is held in high\r\nesteem. Greece and Turkey, the countries that the men are taught to\r\nexpect to fight, are traditional enemies; so also is Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being obligatory, military service is nearly universal,\r\nand it is difficult to evade. Service life is extolled in the media, and\r\nno widespread criticism, either of the forces as a whole or of\r\nindividuals as servicemen, is aired. Military experience provides\r\nvocational training, much of which is beneficial to the individual and\r\nto the national economy.\r\n\r\nSpecial social benefits are available to the forces' personnel. If their\r\nservice results in unusual hardships for their dependents, the families\r\nare given extra consideration. Monthly benefit payments to wives or\r\nparents experiencing financial problems exceed those to nonmilitary\r\nfamilies by 30 percent. Wives who remain behind get preferential\r\ntreatment for prenatal or child care or while job hunting. As the men\r\ncome to the end of their duty tours, they are assisted in their\r\ntransition to civilian life, in their search for educational\r\nopportunities, or in job placement. If disabled in the service, a\r\nveteran gets a pension that is more liberal than usual for the same\r\ndisability acquired elsewhere and continuing assistance that includes\r\nfree transportation on public transport as well as medical treatment and\r\ncare of such things as orthopedic apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicine\r\n\r\nThe medical service provides treatment and preventive medicine for\r\nmilitary personnel and, in certain circumstances, for dependents and for\r\npersons employed by the military. Its services are also available to the\r\npublic at large during individual emergencies, if they are the most\r\nimmediately available, and on a larger scale during epidemics or natural\r\ndisasters. Military personnel may also avail themselves of emergency\r\nfacilities in nonmilitary hospitals or clinics.\r\n\r\nSince about 1960 the medical service has been upgraded in several major\r\nrespects. That year saw the formation of a higher military medical\r\ninstitute, located on the site of the army's general hospital, for\r\nadvanced, specialized training of physicians. In addition to providing\r\nbetter training for military doctors, the objective was to establish a\r\nresearch center for in-depth study of the special military aspects of\r\nmedical science. A more pragmatic objective was to initiate long-overdue\r\nimprovement in medical services for the armed forces. In its first ten\r\nyears the institute gave advanced instruction to 6,500 medical personnel\r\nand an additional specialty to some 200 medical officers.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the higher medical institute, the medical\r\nservices were given considerably broader authority over sanitation and\r\nhygienic conditions throughout the military establishment. They\r\ndetermine standards to be maintained and make inspections of living\r\nquarters, food services, water supplies, bathing and laundry facilities,\r\nand training and recreational areas; they give instruction in personal\r\nand group hygiene. They also participate in the planning and design of\r\nnew barracks and any other buildings where troops work or train.\r\n\r\nAppropriate to the enhanced status and authority of the medical service,\r\nits section of the ministry was upgraded and has become one of the dozen\r\nmore important branches under the minister of national defense. Its\r\nchief has been a doctor, the only major staff member who has been\r\nneither a general officer of one of the armed services nor a\r\nhigh-ranking party official.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Justice\r\n\r\nMilitary courts, or tribunals, are special courts but are part of the\r\nnational judicial system and subject to the same codes as are the\r\ncivilian courts. In the same kind of relationship, military crimes are a\r\nspecial category of crime but are listed within the overall Bulgarian\r\ncriminal code. The separation of military justice from the rest of the\r\njudicial machinery is almost complete, however, although jurisdiction in\r\na criminal situation could be in question and, in its early treatment, a\r\ncase could be transferred from the jurisdiction of a military to a civil\r\ncourt or vice versa. Once tried before a military tribunal, the\r\nproceedings and sentence of a trial might be reviewed by a higher\r\nmilitary court or might go to the Supreme Court, but it would be\r\nextremely rare for a case to be reviewed by a civil court. Within the\r\nSupreme Court a review would be accomplished only by a military panel of\r\nthat court.\r\n\r\nMilitary crimes are those committed on military installations or those\r\nthat relate to the performance of military duty, to military property or\r\npersonnel, to military honor, or to certain aspects of national\r\nsecurity. Servicemen of all ranks, military reserves during their\r\ntraining or whenever they are under military control, personnel of the\r\npolice or any of the other militarized security units, or any other\r\npersons involved in military crimes are liable to military justice. In\r\ngeneral, sentences for military crimes are more severe than for\r\nequivalent crimes tried before civilian courts. For example, failing to\r\ncarry out the order of a superior is punishable by up to two years'\r\ndeprivation of freedom, and conviction for \"clearly indicating\r\ndissatisfaction with an instruction\" can result in a year's confinement.\r\nOn the other hand, in many such crimes the perpetrator's fate is subject\r\nto the discretion of his commander. If the commander determines that the\r\noffense does not \"substantially affect military discipline,\" he may\r\nadminister some lesser punishment without a trial, or he may refer the\r\ncase to a Komsomol or party cell in his unit and allow it to take\r\nwhatever action it sees fit. In times of war or under combat conditions\r\npossible sentences are much more severe, and the death penalty may be\r\nhanded down for many more crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogistics\r\n\r\nBulgaria's armed forces cost the country considerably less per man than\r\ndo those of its allies, and the amount spent on equipment and\r\nmaintenance is relatively austere. This is also indicated by the\r\ncomposition of its forces, in which all armored units, for example, are\r\nof less than division strength.\r\n\r\nNearly all heavier and more complex items of military hardware are\r\nproduced in the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria receives only those items\r\nthat are being replaced in the Soviet forces' inventory or that have\r\nbeen produced in quantities greater than needed in Soviet units. Older\r\nequipment, however, is seldom retained after it has become obsolete.\r\nArmies engaged in combined operations must have compatible equipment,\r\nand maintaining supply channels required for indefinite maintenance of\r\nold items can become more costly than replacing them.\r\n\r\nEach of the Warsaw Pact allies produces ammunition, small arms, some\r\nvehicles, and spare parts for a portion of its matériel that was\r\noriginally produced elsewhere. Bulgaria, with its less developed\r\nindustrial base, produces a relatively small amount of military\r\nequipment locally. In order to preserve items on hand, much of the\r\ntraining schedule is devoted to proper storage and handling of\r\nequipment. Because the standard of living in the country is low, most of\r\nthe troops are familiar with few luxuries and get along with fewer\r\nnonessentials than do the forces of its more relatively affluent allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRanks, Uniforms, and Decorations\r\n\r\nGround and air forces use the same system of ranks although, at least\r\nduring peacetime, the four-star army general rank has no equivalent in\r\nthe air or naval forces. Below the army general there are three general\r\ngrade, three field grade, and four company grade officer ranks. In\r\ndescending order the general grades are colonel general, lieutenant\r\ngeneral, and major general; the field grades are colonel, lieutenant\r\ncolonel, and major; and the company grades are captain, senior\r\nlieutenant, lieutenant, and junior lieutenant. Naval officer ranks\r\ninclude three admiral, four captain, and three lieutenant grades. The\r\nground and air forces have six enlisted grades: four sergeant and two\r\nprivate. The naval forces have equivalent petty officer and seaman\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nAccording to military spokesmen there has been a continuing program to\r\nimprove uniforms since about 1958, when the forces began to replace\r\nSoviet World War II styles with locally designed and manufactured\r\nmodels. Most of the changes adopted since the original change-over have\r\nconsisted of improvements in the materials used and increasing the\r\nnumber of clothing items issued to each man. Until the early 1960s, for\r\nexample, the same uniform was used by several classes of draftees. Each\r\ndraftee now receives a complete new issue and receives new trousers and\r\nfootwear each year.\r\n\r\nNew styles, several including changes in materials and minor changes in\r\ncolor, were shown and tested in 1970. Issue of the newer varieties to\r\nthe forces was begun in 1972. Most changes involved tailoring details\r\nand the use of more wrinkle-resistant and lighter, tighter woven cloth.\r\nThe aim has been to improve the appearance of the men with as little as\r\npossible sacrifice in long-wearing qualities.\r\n\r\nOfficers continue to wear a service uniform consisting of a tailored\r\nblouse with patch pockets and trousers that tuck into high boots. A Sam\r\nBrowne belt and sidearms are optional. The styles introduced in the\r\nearly 1970s have a vent in the blouse to make it fit in a better\r\ntailored fashion, and they are a lighter green than their predecessors.\r\nGround forces have stripes and piping on caps and rank insignia that\r\nvary in color to identify their branch of service (armored forces,\r\ninfantry, transport, engineer, and others). The enlisted men's uniform\r\nis similar in design but has different quality material and less ornate\r\ntrim. Air forces have the same uniforms but may be identified by their\r\nblue stripes and piping. Naval personnel wear the traditional navy blues\r\nand whites.\r\n\r\nRank insignia on the uniforms seen most frequently consists of stars or\r\nstripes on shoulder boards. Officer ranks are identified by varying\r\nnumbers of stars. The boards themselves become progressively more ornate\r\nwith higher rank. Those of the company grades are relatively plain;\r\nthose of the generals are highly ornate. Enlisted grades are shown by\r\nstripes. Privates have none, their shoulder boards are plain; and the\r\nnumber and width of the stripes increase with promotion to higher\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nDecorations and medals are awarded profusely, and most of them are\r\nornate and colorful. The highest ranking and most respected, however, is\r\na simple gold star, which identifies its recipient as a Hero of the\r\nPeople's Republic of Bulgaria. The Order of Georgi Dimitrov and the\r\nnewer Stara Planina medal, which has been declared equal to the former\r\nin seniority, are the next most important. These three most highly\r\ncherished decorations are awarded in only one class each. The highest\r\nof the orders that are presented in several classes are the Order of the\r\nPeople's Republic of Bulgaria and the Madarski Konnik medal, which are\r\nequal in seniority. They are awarded in three and two classes,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\nBulgaria's gross national product (GNP) is only about one-third the\r\naverage of the other Warsaw Pact allies, and during the late 1960s and\r\nearly 1970s Bulgaria spent a smaller proportion of its GNP on defense\r\nthan did any of its allies. Although its 1973 estimated population was\r\nless than one-half the average of its allies, it maintained about\r\nfive-sixths as many men in its regular forces. On the surface,\r\ntherefore, it would appear that the armed forces were a\r\nless-than-average financial burden but a greater-than-average manpower\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nThe appearances may be misleading to some degree. The country has been\r\nthe slowest of the pact nations to industrialize, and its standard of\r\nliving has been the lowest. It is probably, therefore, less able to\r\nafford its relatively moderate defense costs. Its labor force is large\r\nenough for the level of the country's industrialization, but there is a\r\nshortage of skilled workers. The training and experience that young men\r\nreceive in the armed forces broaden their familiarity with complex\r\nmechanical and electronic equipment and provide many of them with skills\r\nthat are of value to the national economy. The regime also considers\r\nthat the disciplinary habits and the political orientation acquired in\r\nmilitary service are of positive social value, outweighing the time that\r\nyoung men are withheld from the labor force.\r\n\r\nWhen extraordinary measures are required in an emergency situation--such\r\nas during the 1972 drought--the armed forces are able to provide a mass\r\nlabor force and to contribute the use of a considerable amount of heavy\r\nmechanical equipment. In 1972 force units were called upon to get\r\nmaximum efficiency from irrigation systems and to add to the sources of\r\nirrigation water whenever possible. Military units also do field work on\r\npublic projects. They are encouraged to contribute the days before\r\npublic holidays, the holidays themselves, and other time that does not\r\ninterfere with training schedules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nSection I.

Through many years of factional splits,\r\n  coalitions, changes of designation, underground operations, and front\r\n  organizations, the BKP finally emerged from World War II (with Soviet\r\n  backing) as the only viable political force in the country.\r\n\r\n  COMECON--Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Economic alliance\r\n  founded in 1949 to further cooperation among member states. Members\r\n  are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia,\r\n  Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Headquarters is in Moscow.\r\n\r\n  Fatherland Front--An umbrella organization for all other mass\r\n  organizations; provides a structure for democratic electoral processes\r\n  but, actually, is controlled by the BKP.\r\n\r\n  greenback--United States legal tender. Term used in international\r\n  monetary transactions since convertibility of the United States dollar\r\n  into gold was suspended on August 15, 1971.\r\n\r\n  lev (pl., leva)--Basic unit of currency; divided into 100 stotinki\r\n  (_q.v._). Officially rated at the artificial level of 0.97 per US$1.\r\n  Lev is nonconvertible and is actually exchanged at several different\r\n  rates depending on type of transaction.\r\n\r\n  stotinki (sing., stotinka)--100 stotinki equal one lev.\r\n\r\n  Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact)--A military alliance founded\r\n  in 1955. The Soviet minister of defense is traditionally the supreme\r\n  commander of the joint pact forces. Members are Bulgaria,\r\n  Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet\r\n  Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Academy of Agricultural Sciences: 135\r\n\r\n Academy
