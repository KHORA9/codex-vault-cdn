LOUIS, MISSOURI [Illustration] OCTOBER 2, 1907\r\n\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WASHINGTON\r\n                       GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\r\n                                  1907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a very real pleasure to address this body of citizens of Missouri\r\nhere in the great city of St. Louis. I have often visited St. Louis\r\nbefore, but always by rail. Now I am visiting it in the course of a\r\ntrip by water, a trip on the great natural highway which runs past\r\nyour very doors――a highway once so important, now almost abandoned,\r\nwhich I hope this nation will see not only restored to all its\r\nformer usefulness, but given a far greater degree of usefulness to\r\ncorrespond with the extraordinary growth in wealth and population of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. We have lived in an era of phenomenal railroad\r\nbuilding. As routes for merchandise, the iron highways have completely\r\nsupplanted the old wagon roads, and under their competition the\r\nimportance of the water highways has been much diminished. The growth\r\nof the railway system has been rapid all over the world, but nowhere so\r\nrapid as in the United States. Accompanying this there has grown in the\r\nUnited States a tendency toward the practically complete abandonment of\r\nthe system of water transportation. Such a tendency is certainly not\r\nhealthy and I am convinced that it will not be permanent. There are\r\nmany classes of commodities, especially those which are perishable in\r\ntheir nature and where the value is high relatively to the bulk, which\r\nwill always be carried by rail. But bulky commodities which are not of\r\na perishable nature will always be specially suited for the conditions\r\nof water transport. To illustrate the truth of this statement it would\r\nonly be necessary to point to the use of the canal system in many\r\ncountries of the Old World; but it can be illustrated even better by\r\nwhat has happened nearer home. The Great Lakes offer a prime example of\r\nthe importance of a good water highway for mercantile traffic. As the\r\nline of traffic runs through lakes, the conditions are in some respects\r\ndifferent from what must obtain on even the most important river.\r\nNevertheless, it is well to remember that a very large part of this\r\ntraffic is conditioned upon an artificial waterway, a canal――the famous\r\nSoo. The commerce that passes through the Soo far surpasses in bulk and\r\nin value that of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nFrom every standpoint it is desirable for the Nation to join in\r\nimproving the greatest system of river highways within its borders, a\r\nsystem second only in importance to the highway afforded by the Great\r\nLakes; the highways of the Mississippi and its great tributaries, such\r\nas the Missouri and Ohio. This river system traverses too many States\r\nto render it possible to leave merely to the States the task of fitting\r\nit for the greatest use of which it is capable. It is emphatically\r\na national task, for this great river system is itself one of our\r\nchief national assets. Within the last few years there has been an\r\nawakening in this country to the need of both the conservation and the\r\ndevelopment of our national resources under the supervision of and by\r\nthe aid of the Federal Government. This is especially true of all that\r\nconcerns our running waters. On the mountains from which the springs\r\nstart we are now endeavoring to preserve the forests which regulate the\r\nwater supply and prevent too startling variations between droughts and\r\nfreshets. Below the mountains, in the high dry regions of the western\r\nplains, we endeavor to secure the proper utilization of the waters\r\nfor irrigation. This is at the sources of the streams. Farther down,\r\nwhere they become navigable, our aim must be to try to develop a policy\r\nwhich shall secure the utmost advantage from the navigable waters.\r\nFinally, on the lower courses of the Mississippi, the Nation should\r\ndo its full share in the work of levee building; and, incidentally\r\nto its purpose of serving navigation, this will also prevent the ruin\r\nof alluvial bottoms by floods. Our knowledge is not sufficiently far\r\nadvanced to enable me to speak definitely as to the plans which should\r\nbe adopted; but let me say one word of warning: The danger of entering\r\non any such scheme lies in the adoption of impossible and undesirable\r\nplans, plans the adoption of which means an outlay of money extravagant\r\nbeyond all proportion to the return, or which, though feasible, are\r\nnot, relatively to other plans, of an importance which warrant their\r\nadoption. It will not be easy to secure the assent of a fundamentally\r\ncautious people like our own to the adoption of such a policy as that\r\nI hope to see adopted; and even if we begin to follow out such a\r\npolicy it certainly will not be persevered in if it is found to entail\r\nreckless extravagance or to be tainted with jobbery. The interests of\r\nthe Nation as a whole must be always the first consideration.\r\n\r\nThis is properly a national movement, because all interstate and\r\nforeign commerce, and the improvements and methods of carrying it on,\r\nare subjects for national action. Moreover, while of course the matter\r\nof the improvement of the Mississippi River and its tributaries is one\r\nwhich especially concerns the great middle portion of our country, the\r\nregion between the Alleghenies and the Rockies, yet it is of concern to\r\nthe rest of the country also, for it can not too often be said that\r\nwhatever is really beneficial to one part of our country is ultimately\r\nof benefit to the whole. Exactly as it is a good thing for the interior\r\nof our country that the seaports on the Atlantic and the Pacific and\r\nthe Gulf should be safe and commodious, so it is to the interest of the\r\ndwellers on the coast that the interior should possess ample facilities\r\nfor the transportation of its products. Our interests are all closely\r\ninterwoven, and in the long run it will be found that we go up or go\r\ndown together.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the Panama Canal. If the Mississippi is restored\r\nto its former place of importance as a highway of commerce, then the\r\nbuilding of the Panama Canal will be felt as an immediate advantage\r\nto the business of every city and country district in the Mississippi\r\nValley. I think that the building of that canal will be of especial\r\nadvantage to the States that lie along the Pacific and the States that\r\nlie along the Gulf; and yet, after all, I feel that the advantage will\r\nbe shared in an only less degree by the States of the interior and of\r\nthe Atlantic coast. In other words, it is a thoroughly national work,\r\nundertaken for and redounding to the advantage of all of us――to the\r\nadvantage of the Nation as a whole. Therefore I am glad to be able to\r\nreport to you how well we are doing with the canal. There is bound to\r\nbe a certain amount of experiment, a certain amount of feeling our way,\r\nin a task so gigantic――a task greater than any of its kind that has\r\never hitherto been undertaken in the whole history of mankind; but the\r\nsuccess so far has been astonishing, and we have not met with a single\r\none of the accidents or drawbacks which I freely confess I expected\r\nwe should from time to time encounter. We, in the first place, laid\r\nthe foundation for the work by securing the most favorable possible\r\nconditions as regard the health, comfort, and safety of the men who\r\nwere to do it; and now the Canal Zone is in point of health better\r\noff than the average district of the same size at home. Then we went\r\nat the problem of the actual digging and dam building. For over a year\r\npast we have been engaged in making the dirt fly in good earnest,\r\nand the output of the giant steam shovels has steadily increased. It\r\nis now the rainy season, when work is most difficult on the Isthmus,\r\nyet in the month of August last we excavated over a million and two\r\nhundred thousand cubic yards of earth and rock, a greater amount than\r\nin any previous month. If we are able to keep up substantially the\r\nrate of progress that now obtains we shall finish the actual digging\r\nwithin five or six years; though when we come to the great Gatun dam\r\nand locks, while there is no question as to the work being feasible,\r\nthere are several elements entering into the time problem which make it\r\nunwise at present to hazard a prophecy in reference thereto.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, this leads me up to another matter for national\r\nconsideration, and that is our Navy. The Navy is not primarily of\r\nimportance only to the coast regions. It is every bit as much the\r\nconcern of the farmer who dwells a thousand miles from sea water as\r\nof the fisherman who makes his living on the ocean, for it is the\r\nconcern of every good American who knows what the meaning of the\r\nword patriotism is. This country is definitely committed to certain\r\nfundamental policies――to the Monroe doctrine, for instance, and to\r\nthe duty not only of building, but, when it is built, of policing\r\nand defending the Panama Canal. We have definitely taken our place\r\namong the great world powers, and it would be a sign of ignoble\r\nweakness, having taken such a place, to shirk its responsibilities.\r\nTherefore, unless we are willing to abandon this place, to abandon\r\nour insistence upon the Monroe doctrine, to give up the Panama Canal,\r\nand to be content to acknowledge ourselves a weak and timid nation,\r\nwe must steadily build up and maintain a great fighting Navy. Our\r\nNavy is already so efficient as to be a matter of just pride to every\r\nAmerican. So long as our Navy is no larger than at present, it must\r\nbe considered as an elementary principle that the bulk of our battle\r\nfleet must always be kept together. When the Panama Canal is built it\r\ncan be transferred without difficulty from one part of our coast to\r\nthe other; but even before that canal is built it ought to be thus\r\ntransferred to and fro from time to time. In a couple of months our\r\nfleet of great armored ships starts for the Pacific. California,\r\nOregon, and Washington have a coast line which is our coast line just\r\nas emphatically as the coast line of New York and Maine, of Louisiana\r\nand Texas. Our fleet is going to its own home waters in the Pacific,\r\nand after a stay there it will return to its own home waters in the\r\nAtlantic. The best place for a naval officer to learn his duties is\r\nat sea, by performing them, and only by actually putting through a\r\nvoyage of this nature, a voyage longer than any ever before undertaken\r\nby as large a fleet of any nation, can we find out just exactly what\r\nis necessary for us to know as to our naval needs and practice our\r\nofficers and enlisted men in the highest duties of their profession.\r\nAmong all our citizens there is no body of equal size to whom we owe\r\nquite as much as to the officers and enlisted men of the Army and Navy\r\nof the United States, and I bespeak from you the fullest and heartiest\r\nsupport, in the name of our Nation and of our flag, for the services\r\nto which these men belong.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I wish to say a word to this body, containing as it\r\ndoes so many business men, upon what is preeminently a business\r\nproposition, and that is the proper national supervision and control of\r\ncorporations. At the meeting of the American Bar Association in this\r\nlast August, Judge Charles F. Amidon, of North Dakota, read a paper on\r\nthe Nation and the Constitution so admirable that it is deserving of\r\nvery wide study; for what he said was, as all studies of law in its\r\nhighest form ought to be, a contribution to constructive jurisprudence\r\nas it should be understood not only by judges but by legislators, not\r\nonly by those who interpret and decide the law, but by those who make\r\nit and who administer or execute it. He quoted from the late Justice\r\nMiller, of the Supreme Court, to show that even in the interpretation\r\nof the Constitution by this, the highest authority of the land, the\r\ncourt’s successive decisions must be tested by the way they work in\r\nactual application to the National life; the court adding to its\r\nthought and study the results of experience and observation until the\r\ntrue solution is evolved by a process both of inclusion and exclusion.\r\nSaid Justice Miller: “The meaning of the Constitution is to be sought\r\nas much in the National life as in the dictionary;” for, as has been\r\nwell said, government purely out of a law library can never be really\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\nNow that the questions of government are becoming so largely economic,\r\nthe majority of our so-called constitutional cases really turn not\r\nupon the interpretation of the instrument itself, but upon the\r\nconstruction, the right apprehension of the living conditions to which\r\nit is to be applied. The Constitution is now and must remain what it\r\nalways has been; but it can only be interpreted as the interests of\r\nthe whole people demand, if interpreted as a living organism, designed\r\nto meet the conditions of life and not of death; in other words, if\r\ninterpreted as Marshall interpreted it, as Wilson declared it should be\r\ninterpreted. The Marshall theory, the theory of life and not of death,\r\nallows to the Nation, that is to the people as a whole, when once it\r\nfinds a subject within the national cognizance, the widest and freest\r\nchoice of methods for national control, and sustains every exercise of\r\nnational power which has any reasonable relation to national objects.\r\nThe negation of this theory means, for instance, that the Nation――that\r\nwe, the ninety millions of people of this country――will be left\r\nhelpless to control the huge corporations which now domineer in our\r\nindustrial life, and that they will have the authority of the courts to\r\nwork their desires unchecked; and such a decision would in the end be\r\nas disastrous for them as for us. If the theory of the Marshall school\r\nprevails, then an immense field of national power, now unused, will be\r\ndeveloped, which will be adequate for dealing with many, if not all,\r\nof the economic problems which vex us; and we shall be saved from the\r\nominous threat of a constant oscillation between economic tyranny and\r\neconomic chaos. Our industrial, and therefore our social, future as a\r\nNation depends upon settling aright this urgent question.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution is unchanged and unchangeable save by amendment in due\r\nform. But the conditions to which it is to be applied have undergone\r\na change which is almost a transformation, with the result that many\r\nsubjects formerly under the control of the States have come under the\r\ncontrol of the Nation. As one of the justices of the Supreme Court has\r\nrecently said: “The growth of national powers, under our Constitution,\r\nwhich marks merely the great outlines and designates only the great\r\nobjects of national concern, is to be compared to the growth of a\r\ncountry not by the geographical enlargement of its boundaries, but\r\nby the increase of its population.” A hundred years ago there was,\r\nexcept the commerce which crawled along our seacoast or up and down our\r\ninterior waterways, practically no interstate commerce. Now, by the\r\nrailroad, the mails, the telegraph, and the telephone an immense part\r\nof our commerce is interstate. By the transformation it has escaped\r\nfrom the power of the State and come under the power of the Nation.\r\nTherefore there has been a great practical change in the exercise\r\nof the National power, under the acts of Congress, over interstate\r\ncommerce; while on the other hand there has been no noticeable change\r\nin the exercise of the National power “to regulate commerce with\r\nforeign nations and with the Indian tribes.” The change as regards\r\ninterstate commerce has been, not in the Constitution, but in the\r\nbusiness of the people to which it is to be applied. Our economic\r\nand social future depends in very large part upon how the interstate\r\ncommerce power of the Nation is interpreted.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Nation has the whole governmental power over\r\ninterstate commerce and the widest discretion in dealing with that\r\nsubject; of course under the express limits prescribed in the\r\nConstitution for the exercise of all powers, such for instance as the\r\ncondition that “due process of law” shall not be denied. The Nation\r\nhas no direct power over purely intrastate commerce, even where it is\r\nconducted by the same agencies which conduct interstate commerce. The\r\ncourts must determine what is national and what is State commerce. The\r\nsame reasoning which sustained the power of Congress to incorporate\r\nthe United States Bank tends to sustain the power to incorporate an\r\ninterstate railroad, or any other corporation conducting an interstate\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThere are difficulties arising from our dual form of government.\r\nIf they prove to be insuperable resort must be had to the power of\r\namendment. Let us first try to meet them by an exercise of all the\r\npowers of the National Government which in the Marshall spirit of\r\nbroad interpretation can be found in the Constitution as it is. They\r\nare of vast extent. The chief economic question of the day in this\r\ncountry is to provide a sovereign for the great corporations engaged\r\nin interstate business; that is, for the railroads and the interstate\r\nindustrial corporations. At the moment our prime concern is with\r\nthe railroads. When railroads were first built they were purely\r\nlocal in character. Their boundaries were not coextensive even with\r\nthe boundaries of one State. They usually covered but two or three\r\ncounties. All this has now changed. At present five great systems\r\nembody nearly four-fifths of the total mileage of the country. All the\r\nmost important railroads are no longer State roads, but instruments\r\nof interstate commerce. Probably 85 per cent of their business is\r\ninterstate business. It is the Nation alone which can with wisdom,\r\njustice, and effectiveness exercise over these interstate railroads\r\nthe thorough and complete supervision which should be exercised. One\r\nof the chief, and probably the chief, of the domestic causes for the\r\nadoption of the Constitution was the need to confer upon the Nation\r\nexclusive control over interstate commerce. But this grant of power\r\nis worthless unless it is held to confer thoroughgoing and complete\r\ncontrol over practically the sole instrumentalities of interstate\r\ncommerce――the interstate railroads. The railroads themselves have\r\nbeen exceedingly shortsighted in the rancorous bitterness which they\r\nhave shown against the resumption by the Nation of this long-neglected\r\npower. Great capitalists, who pride themselves upon their extreme\r\nconservatism, often believe they are acting in the interests of\r\nproperty when following a course so shortsighted as to be really an\r\nassault upon property. They have shown extreme unwisdom in their\r\nviolent opposition to the assumption of complete control over the\r\nrailroads by the Federal Government. The American people will not\r\ntolerate the happy-go-lucky system of no control over the great\r\ninterstate railroads, with the insolent and manifold abuses which\r\nhave so generally accompanied it. The control must exist somewhere;\r\nand unless it is by thoroughgoing and radical law placed upon the\r\nstatute books of the Nation, it will be exercised in ever-increasing\r\nmeasure by the several States. The same considerations which made\r\nthe founders of the Constitution deem it imperative that the Nation\r\nshould have complete control of interstate commerce apply with peculiar\r\nforce to the control of interstate railroads at the present day; and\r\nthe arguments of Madison of Virginia, Pinckney of South Carolina,\r\nand Hamilton and Jay of New York, in their essence apply now as they\r\napplied one hundred and twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe national convention which framed the Constitution, and in which\r\nalmost all the most eminent of the first generation of American\r\nstatesmen sat, embodied the theory of the instrument in a resolution,\r\nto the effect that the National Government should have power in cases\r\nwhere the separate States were incompetent to act with full efficiency,\r\nand where the harmony of the United States would be interrupted by\r\nthe exercise of such individual legislation. The interstate railroad\r\nsituation is exactly a case in point. There will, of course, be local\r\nmatters affecting railroads which can best be dealt with by local\r\nauthority, but as national commercial agents the big interstate\r\nrailroad ought to be completely subject to national authority. Only\r\nthus can we secure their complete subjection to, and control by, a\r\nsingle sovereign, representing the whole people, and capable both of\r\nprotecting the public and of seeing that the railroads neither inflict\r\nnor endure injustice.\r\n\r\nPersonally I firmly believe that there should be national legislation\r\nto control all industrial corporations doing an interstate business,\r\nincluding the control of the output of their securities, but as to\r\nthese the necessity for Federal control is less urgent and immediate\r\nthan is the case with the railroads. Many of the abuses connected\r\nwith these corporations will probably tend to disappear now that\r\nthe Government――the public――is gradually getting the upper hand as\r\nregards putting a stop to the rebates and special privileges which\r\nsome of these corporations have enjoyed at the hands of the common\r\ncarriers. But ultimately it will be found that the complete remedy for\r\nthese abuses lies in direct and affirmative action by the National\r\nGovernment. That there is constitutional power for the national\r\nregulation of these corporations I have myself no question. Two or\r\nthree generations ago there was just as much hostility to national\r\ncontrol of banks as there is now to national control of railroads\r\nor of industrial corporations doing an interstate business. That\r\nhostility now seems to us ludicrous in its lack of warrant; in\r\nlike manner, gentlemen, our descendants will regard with wonder the\r\npresent opposition to giving the National Government adequate power to\r\ncontrol those great corporations, which it alone can fully, and yet\r\nwisely, safely, and justly control. Remember also that to regulate\r\nthe formation of these corporations offers one of the most direct and\r\nefficient methods of regulating their activities.\r\n\r\nI am not pleading for an extension of constitutional power. I am\r\npleading that constitutional power which already exists shall be\r\napplied to new conditions which did not exist when the Constitution\r\nwent into being. I ask that the national powers already conferred upon\r\nthe National Government by the Constitution shall be so used as to\r\nbring national commerce and industry effectively under the authority\r\nof the Federal Government and thereby avert industrial chaos. My plea\r\nis not to bring about a condition of centralization. It is that the\r\nGovernment shall recognize a condition of centralization in a field\r\nwhere it already exists. When the national banking law was passed it\r\nrepresented in reality not centralization, but recognition of the fact\r\nthat the country had so far advanced that the currency was already\r\na matter of National concern and must be dealt with by the central\r\nauthority at Washington. So it is with interstate industrialism and\r\nespecially with the matter of interstate railroad operation to-day.\r\nCentralization has already taken place in the world of commerce and\r\nindustry. All I ask is that the National Government look this fact in\r\nthe face, accept it as a fact, and fit itself accordingly for a policy\r\nof supervision and control over this centralized commerce and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *",
